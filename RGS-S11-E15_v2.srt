1
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:04,404
Red Green: ISN'T IT GREAT TO
BE ABLE TO HELP THE BIRDS

2
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:07,140
THROUGH THE WINTER
WITH THESE BIRD FEEDERS?

3
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:09,809
WE ALL WANT THE BIRDS TO BE
HEALTHY AND HAPPY

4
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,945
BECAUSE IT'LL BE HUNTING
SEASON BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

5
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:13,980
I'M KIDDIN'.

6
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:17,217
BUT YOU KNOW, THIS YEAR,
WE'VE HAD THE WORST WINTER
WE'VE HAD IN A WHILE.

7
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:20,253
I'M JUST AFRAID NORMAL
BIRDSEED WON'T DO THE JOB.

8
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:26,226
THEY NEED FOOD THAT'LL
HELP THEM GENERATE A
LITTLE EXTRA HEAT

9
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:28,028
IN THOSE TINY BODIES,

10
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:30,764
AND THAT'S WHY I'VE MIXED UP
THIS BATCH OF JALAPEÃ‘OS,

11
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:34,701
CHILI PEPPERS AND
EXTRA, EXTRA HOT SAUCE.

12
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:37,871
GIVE THIS BIRDSEED A LITTLE
BOOST IN THE HORSEPOWER
DEPARTMENT.

13
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:46,646
[birds chirping]

14
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,949
I THINK IT'S GONNA BE A LITTLE
WARMER IN THE NEST TONIGHT.

15
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:02,695
[cheers and applause]

16
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:10,870
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

17
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:17,343
BIG, BIG WEEK UP AT
THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

18
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,045
[applause continues]

19
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,447
ALL RIGHT, YEAH.

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,082
I KNOW YOU'RE EXCITED

21
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:24,284
BECAUSE TOMORROW IS THE
DAY THE TOWN HAS

22
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,252
THEIR ANNUAL
MASQUERADE PICNIC.

23
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,088
IT USED TO BE
JUST A NORMAL PICNIC.

24
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,556
WE HAD THE POTLUCK
SUPPER IN THERE,

25
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:31,891
BUT WE HAD SO MANY FOOD
POISONING CLAIMS

26
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,861
THAT NOW EVERYONE WEARS A
COSTUME TO PROTECT THE GUILTY.

27
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:39,399
SPEAKING OF PROTECTING
THE GUILTY...

28
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:41,234
SO, UH,
WHAT'S UP, MIKE?

29
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,802
I'M NOT MIKE.

30
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,437
NO.
OH, REALLY?

31
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,640
I'M AN INTERESTING STRANGER
FROM A FARAWAY TOWN.

32
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:51,511
THERE'S NO ONE NAMED MIKE
LIVING IN THE PLACE OF
WHICH I SPEAK.

33
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:53,847
REALLY?
YEAH. MM-HMM.

34
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,552
WHAT'S THE
PROBLEM?

35
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,188
YOU GOTTA HELP ME,
MR. GREEN!

36
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,424
ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO
I RATTED ON THIS GUY

37
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,359
NAMED BIG AL
FINKLEMAN.

38
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:07,961
I SENT HIM UP TO
THE SLAMMER.

39
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,662
AND I HEARD YESTERDAY
HE JUST GOT OUT,

40
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,564
AND HE'S COMING TO
GET ME TO PAY ME BACK.

41
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,867
WHAT AM
I GONNA DO?

42
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,870
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
YOU'RE NOT MIKE.

43
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:19,172
OH, YEAH.
I'M MIKE.

44
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:20,974
I AM MIKE.
YOU HAVE A LOOK.

45
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,644
"DALTON HUMPHREY."

46
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,181
YEAH, YOU'RE MIKE
ALL RIGHT.

47
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:29,883
LOOK, MIKE, HERE'S
ALL YOU GOTTA DO...

48
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,684
TOMORROW'S THE
MASQUERADE PICNIC, RIGHT?

49
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,553
SO GO OUT AND GET
YOURSELF A DECENT COSTUME,

50
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,221
AND YOU'LL BLEND
RIGHT IN.

51
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,457
THIS BIG AL GUY'LL
NEVER FIND YOU.

52
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,159
OH, THAT'S A
GREAT IDEA.

53
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:40,827
I'M GONNA GO RIGHT TO
THE COSTUME STORE.

54
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,595
HOW LATE ARE
THEY OPEN?

55
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,031
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
THERE'LL BE SOMEBODY
THERE TILL SIX.

56
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:46,900
OKAY, I'LL WAIT.

57
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:57,210
IT'S TIME FOR THE
POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME.

58
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:01,281
[cheers and applause]

59
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,555
AND TONIGHT'S LUCKY
WINNER WILL RECEIVE

60
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:12,926
THIS STRIKING FLUORESCENT
BICYCLE HANDLE GRIP.

61
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,261
IDEAL FOR
HITCHHIKING AT NIGHT.

62
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,931
OKAY, CLOSE YOUR EARS.

63
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,567
RED, YOU'VE GOT 30 SECONDS TO
GET HAROLD TO SAY THIS WORD...

64
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,638
ALL RIGHT,
DALTON.

65
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,106
AND GO.

66
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,175
OKAY, HAROLD, WHAT'S THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING ON A CAR?

67
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,711
CUP HOLDERS.

68
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,846
NO, THIS IS A
PERFORMANCE THING.

69
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,849
HO! HO!

70
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,118
RECLINING SEATS?

71
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:43,990
OKAY, WHEN I STOMP DOWN ON
THE POSSUM VAN GAS PEDAL,

72
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,258
IT GIVES ME LOTS OF...

73
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,360
FUMES.

74
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,029
OKAY, WE HAVE TO MOVE
SOMETHING LIKE A PIANO,

75
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:51,831
WE ALWAYS PUT MOOSE THOMPSON
ON THE HEAVY END,

76
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,199
BECAUSE HE HAS MORE...

77
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,335
INSURANCE.

78
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,837
OKAY, HAROLD, WHEN YOU'RE
DANCING WITH A BEAUTIFUL GIRL,

79
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,706
YOU GOT HER IN YOUR ARMS,

80
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:02,542
SUDDENLY BOTH OF YOU FEEL
THE SOMETHING OF LOVE.

81
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,510
[gasping]

82
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,083
TIME'S ALMOST UP, RED.

83
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:12,418
HAROLD, I THINK
WE'RE SCUPPERED HERE.

84
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,053
NO! NO! NO!
DON'T GIVE UP!

85
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,122
JUST USE THE POWER
OF POSITIVE THINKING.

86
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,957
THAT WAS IT!

87
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,434
STATE OF THE ART WASTE 
WATER REMOVAL VEHICLE...
 

88
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,837
$95,000. 

89
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,139
HARD HAT: $20. 

90
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:36,342
TRADEMARK: $14.95. 

91
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,177
HEADING HOME 
WITH CLEAN BOOTS
 

92
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,113
AFTER FOUR PUMP-OUTS 
AND AN OVERFLOW...
 

93
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,614
PRICELESS. 

94
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,449
FOR CITY FOLKS 
THERE'S PUBLIC WORKS;
 

95
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:44,984
FOR EVERYONE ELSE THERE'S 

96
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,253
ROTHSCHILD'S SEWAGE AND 
SEPTIC SUCKING SERVICES.
 

97
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,292
SOME MEN ARE SO COMPETITIVE,

98
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,861
EVEN WITH DUMB THINGS
LIKE BARBECUE GRILLS.

99
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,463
THEY GET THOSE BIG UNITS WITH
THE EXTRA SIDE BURNERS

100
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,966
AND A ROTISSERIE
AND A WET BAR.

101
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,868
WELL, LET'S SHOW THEM
A THING OR TWO, HUH?

102
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:05,004
HERE'S A WAY TO BUILD YOUR OWN
MEGA-GRILL USING SOMETHING

103
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,440
EVERYBODY HAS RIGHT
IN THEIR OWN BACKYARD...

104
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,243
A PREVIOUSLY
ENJOYED AUTOMOBILE.

105
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,679
OH, SURE, YOU HAVE TO MAKE
A FEW ALTERATIONS TO
THE VEHICLE;

106
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,847
BUT, YOU KNOW, THE TRULY
WORTHWHILE THINGS IN LIFE

107
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:16,816
ARE ALWAYS WORTH
A LITTLE EXTRA EFFORT.

108
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,751
NOW, FIRST YOU WANNA
TAKE OFF THE SPARK PLUGS,

109
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,787
BUT LEAVE 'EM HOOKED UP
TO THE IGNITION WIRE.

110
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,989
THEN YOU WANNA
DISCONNECT THE FUEL LINE

111
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,791
FROM THE CARBURATOR.

112
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:26,793
NOW, YOU GOTTA
TAKE THE ENGINE OUTTA HER.

113
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,428
IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT HARD,

114
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,897
ESPECIALLY IF THE VEHICLE'S
BEEN SITTING THERE
FOR A WHILE.

115
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,470
OKAY, YOU MOUNT THE
FUEL LINE ON THE TOP THERE.

116
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,772
THEN YOU RUN YOUR SPARK
PLUGS THROUGH THE SIDE
OF THE UNIT.

117
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,075
THEN YOU PUT THE WHOLE
DEAL DOWN INTO THE CAVITY

118
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,743
WHERE THE ENGINE
USED TO BE --

119
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,212
KIND OF LIKE A
HEART TRANSPLANT.

120
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,014
ALTHOUGH, I BELIEVE
WITH A HEART TRANSPLANT,

121
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,016
THEY CLEAN THEIR
SHOES OFF FIRST.

122
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,753
ALL RIGHT, NOW WE NEED
SOMETHING TO USE AS A GRILL.

123
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,123
HOW ABOUT THE GRILL?

124
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,628
OKAY, I THINK WE'RE ALL
READY TO START BARBECUING.

125
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,797
FIRST THING YOU WANNA DO
IS PUMP THE GAS A FEW TIMES

126
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,232
TO SOAK THE CHARCOAL.

127
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,737
NOW YOU JUST
START HER UP.

128
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,909
OKAY, WE'RE ALL SET TO GRILL
UP SOME DELICIOUS STEAKS.

129
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,011
YOU KNOW, IF SALAD
IS SO GOOD FOR YOU,

130
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,680
HOW COME YOU CAN'T
BARBECUE IT,

131
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,648
CAN YOU ANSWER ME THAT?

132
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,250
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

133
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:28,354
SO HERE I AM SITTING
IN MY DELUXE BARBECUE GRILL.

134
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,923
OUT OF THE RAIN,
SITTING IN PLUSH COMFORT.

135
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:34,560
GOT THE FM/AM STEREO,
IF I SO CHOOSE.

136
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:36,462
WHAT'S THAT YOU SAY?

137
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,398
HOW DO I ADD MY
FAVOURITE STEAK SAUCE?

138
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:41,801
WELL, HEY, ISN'T THAT WHAT
WINDSHIELD WASHERS ARE FOR?

139
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,508
AND JUST SPREAD IT
AROUND WITH THE WIPER.

140
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:56,749
AND IT'S JUST THAT EASY.

141
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,985
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

142
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,354
THEY SHOULD AT
LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

143
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,624
THIS ISN'T A BARBECUE;
IT'S A CARBECUE.

144
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,527
GETS OVER 50
MEALS TO A GALLON.

145
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,495
EVEN MORE IF I GOOSE IT.

146
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:15,535
[cheers and applause]

147
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:24,210
WHEN YOU'RE HIT WITH AN AROMA
THAT BUCKLES YOUR KNEES,

148
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,580
WHEN YOUR PROPERTY SMELLS
LIKE PREHISTORIC CHEESE,

149
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,582
CALL US.
WE'LL HANDLE
THE PROBLEM WITH EASE,

150
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,617
BEFORE YOUR
NEIGHBOURS KEEL OVER

151
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,486
WITH EACH PASSING BREEZE.

152
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:46,466
WELL, EVERYBODY'S ALL DRESSED
UP FOR THE MASQUERADE PICNIC.

153
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,835
MOST OF THEM ARE MONSTERS AND
ANIMALS AND THINGS.

154
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,137
ACTUALLY, THAT WE BEFORE THEY
EVEN PUT THE COSTUMES ON.

155
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,307
HEY, RED, HUH?

156
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:56,709
DO YOU
RECOGNIZE US?

157
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,411
WHY SURE.
IT'S CURLY, LARRY

158
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,780
AND MIKE.

159
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,683
AH, GEE,
IF I CAN'T FOOL YOU,

160
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,318
I CAN'T FOOL
ANYBODY.

161
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,186
BIG AL'S GONNA COME,
AND HE'S GONNA FIND ME,

162
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,988
AND HE'S GONNA
KILL ME.

163
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,624
BOY, YOU'RE GONNA
LOSE THE DEPOSIT
ON YOUR COSTUME.

164
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,159
HEY, I GOT AN IDEA.

165
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,594
WHY DON'T YOU
DRESS UP AS A WOMAN?

166
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,295
THAT'LL FOOL HIM.

167
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:17,897
WELL, THAT'S
KIND OF RISKY.

168
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,765
HE'S BEEN IN PRISON
FOR TEN YEARS.

169
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,968
YOU KNOW WHAT,
MIKE?

170
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,303
IF BIG AL CAME THROUGH
THAT DOOR RIGHT NOW,

171
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,771
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

172
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,406
I'D PROBABLY
SOIL MYSELF.

173
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,143
YOU'D LOSE THE DEPOSIT
ON YOUR COSTUME.

174
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,180
AND I'D RUN.

175
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,581
EXACTLY.

176
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,283
AND THAT'S HOW WE
WOULD HIDE YOU, SEE?

177
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,651
WE'LL GET EVERYONE TO RUN,

178
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,586
AND YOU'LL GET LOST
IN THE SHUFFLE.

179
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,255
BEFORE WE HAVE THE PICNIC,

180
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,390
WE'LL HAVE A
MASQUERADE MARATHON.

181
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,425
KINDA LIKE THE
BOSTON MARATHON.

182
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:49,128
YEAH, EXCEPT WE
WON'T GO 26 MILES.

183
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,597
AND IT WON'T BE
IN BOSTON, RIGHT?

184
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,701
WHAT ABOUT A PRIZE?

185
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:57,537
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO OFFER
SOME KIND OF PRIZE, HUH?

186
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,038
I THINK THAT'S MIKE'S
RESPONSIBILITY.

187
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,673
I MEAN, WE'RE DOING
THIS FOR HIM,

188
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,542
SO I THINK HE'S GOTTA
OFFER THE PRIZE.

189
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,977
OKAY, THE WINNER GETS
TO CHOOSE HIS OWN PRIZE,

190
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,646
AS LONG AS IT'S
AVAILABLE LOCALLY

191
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,915
AND IT CAN BE
CARRIED BY ONE PERSON.

192
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,852
WELCOME TO THE EXPERTS
PORTION OF THE SHOW

193
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,754
WHERE WE ADDRESS
THOSE THREE LITTLE WORDS

194
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,856
MEN FIND SO HARD TO SAY...

195
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,891
audience: I DON'T KNOW! 

196
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,660
THOSE ARE
THE WORDS.

197
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,729
OH, TODAY'S LETTER
IS FROM A LADY.

198
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:27,533
"DEAR EXPERTS: MY HUSBAND
IS A TOTAL EMBARRASSMENT --"

199
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,670
WELL, THAT COULD'VE
BEEN WRITTEN BY EVERY
WOMAN I KNOW.

200
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,707
"ESPECIALLY WHEN HE EATS.

201
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,776
"HE PICKS HIS TEETH;
PUTS HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE;

202
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,078
"AND MAKES RUDE NOISES.

203
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,846
"IT'S GOTTEN SO BAD
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO

204
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,749
"GO OUT TO EXPENSIVE
RESTAURANTS WITH HIM ANYMORE."

205
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,719
WISH I'D THOUGHT
OF THAT.

206
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,188
OH, BOY, I JUST
HATE DINING OUT.

207
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,857
THERE'S JUST SO
MANY LITTLE RULES OF
ETIQUETTE TO REMEMBER.

208
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,526
AH, DALTON, IT'S SIMPLE.

209
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,128
YOU JUST START WITH THE
SMALLER CUTLERY ON
THE OUTSIDE

210
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,130
AND WORK YOUR WAY IN.

211
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,833
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

212
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:03,035
SEE, DALTON'S USED TO CUTLERY
THAT COMES IN A PLASTIC BAG

213
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:06,005
WITH A MOIST TOWELETTE.

214
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,207
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT
THE PROBLEM IS, DON'T YOU?

215
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,444
THIS TOWN DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH
FINE DINING ESTABLISHMENTS.

216
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,846
THAT'S WHY I'M THINKING ABOUT
OPENING UP MY OWN, EH.

217
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,114
YEAH.
OH, YEAH?

218
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,616
WINSTON'S HIDEAWAY.

219
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,217
YOU KNOW,
FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME.

220
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,785
OH, YEAH?
LONELY SEWAGE SUCKERS

221
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,288
WITH NO CHANCE
FOR ROMANCE?

222
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,858
I'M KIND OF PICTURING A
LOT OF TABLES FOR ONE
THERE, WINSTON.

223
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:27,493
NO, NO, NO.
IF SOMEONE COMES IN ALONE,

224
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:30,296
I WOULD JUST SEAT THEM WITH
ANOTHER ELIGIBLE SINGLE.

225
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:33,466
YOU KNOW, KIND OF A DATING
SERVICE/RESTAURANT THING.

226
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:37,303
SOUNDS MORE LIKE A BAD
IDEA/LAWSUIT THING.

227
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,439
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
THIS LADY NEEDS TO DO.

228
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,708
SHE NEEDS TO BE ABLE
TO IGNORE HER HUSBAND,

229
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,177
AND GO TO A RESTAURANT WHERE
THEY HAVE REAL LOW LIGHTS

230
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,846
AND LOUD MUSIC, YOU KNOW?

231
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,681
IF SHE CAN'T SEE HIM
AND CAN'T HEAR HIM,

232
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,149
SHE'S PROBABLY GOING TO GET
ALONG WITH HIM A LOT --

233
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,784
OR BETTER YET --
BETTER YET.

234
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,953
YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST STAY HOME.

235
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,688
THAT'S WHAT
BERNICE AND I DO.

236
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,990
AND BERNICE IS ABLE TO
IGNORE ALL YOUR FAULTS?

237
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,458
OH, SURE, YEAH.

238
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,861
SHE'S SITTING AT ONE END OF
THE TABLE IN THE DINING ROOM,

239
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:04,630
AND I'M LYING ON THE
COUCH IN THE LIVING ROOM.

240
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,467
Red: WE HAVE THIS 
THING WE DO EVERY YEAR.
 

241
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:11,170
WE TRY TO SEE WHO CAN BE THE 
FASTEST COMING DOWN 
THE BIG HILL. 

242
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,305
WE SET UP A CLOCK 
AND SET IT ON 12.
 

243
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,474
YOU SEE THE MARK THERE? 
THE 23-SECOND MARK.
 

244
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,476
THAT IS THE WORLD RECORD FOR 
COMING DOWN OUR HILL. 

245
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,712
SO WE SET IT, 
AND I STOP THE CLOCK 
RIGHT ON THE 12. 

246
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:21,347
THEN I HANG 
A PAINT CAN ON THERE.  

247
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:22,948
ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS 
KNOCK THE PAINT CAN OFF. 

248
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,483
THAT STARTS THE CLOCK. 

249
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,118
AND THEN WE TRY TO GET DOWN 
THE HILL AND HIT THE TIMER.
 

250
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,020
PULLS HER TO STOP -- 
WELL YOU'LL SEE WHAT
 
I MEAN IN A SECOND.

251
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,022
SO I'M GONNA TAKE THE FIRST 
RUN, GET ON THE TOBOGGAN.
 

252
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,757
DALTON -- I TELL DALTON, 
GO AHEAD, I'M READY. 

253
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,926
SO HE WHIPS A SNOWBALL ALL 
THE WAY DOWN THE HILL, 

254
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,928
KNOCKS THE CAN OFF, 
AND THAT STARTS THE CLOCK. 

255
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,963
AND DOWN SHE COMES. 

256
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,566
SO I'M DOING PRETTY GOOD. 
I BELIEVE THERE'S A ROCK
 
SOMEWHERE.

257
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,168
THERE IT IS. 
NO, MISSED THAT. 

258
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,703
WE COMIN' ALONG. 
LOOKIN' GOOD. LOOKIN' GOOD.
 

259
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,204
AND... 

260
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:47,273
I LIKE THIS, BABY. 
OH, BEAUTIFUL. 

261
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,909
AND I GO CHECK MY TIME. 
THAT'S ABOUT 37.
 

262
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,044
I'M A GOOD 14 SECONDS 
OFF THE RECORD.
 

263
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,046
NOW, THE THING ABOUT 
TOBOGGANING, FOR THOSE 
OF YOU WHO HAVE DONE IT,  

264
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,082
YOU KNOW THAT THE MORE WEIGHT 
YOU HAVE ON THE TOBOGGAN,
 

265
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,084
GENERALLY, 
THE FASTER SHE'LL GO.
 

266
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,885
SO I'M FIGURIN' I'M GONNA 
ADD A BIT MORE WEIGHT NOW.
 

267
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:01,554
UNFORTUNATELY, 
WINSTON WAS WITH US, 

268
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,389
AND NOBODY WANTED 
HIM IN FRONT OF THEM.
 

269
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,057
SO WE HAD TO 
KEEP SHOVING HIM BACK. 

270
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,992
NO, BACK YOU GO, WINSTON. 

271
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,061
YOU DON'T WANNA BE DOWN 
WIND FROM WINSTON,
 
THAT'S FOR SURE.

272
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,896
OKAY, SO WE PUT 
WINSTON ON THE BACK THERE. 

273
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,498
AND WE SIGNALLED DALTON. 
OKAY, DALTON, WE'RE READY. 

274
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,533
FIRE AWAY. 

275
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,635
WELL, THAT WAS UNFORTUNATE. 

276
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,337
OKAY, WE'LL GO 
WITHOUT WINSTON THEN.
 

277
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,873
ALL RIGHT, 
AND TRY HER AGAIN. 

278
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,209
I THINK THREE OF US, 
WE'RE GONNA MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE. 

279
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,010
AND AWAY WE GO. 
DOWN WE GO.
 

280
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,679
AND I'M FEELING 
PRETTY GOOD.
 

281
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,180
I'M FEELING THE 
EXTRA SPEED ALREADY. 

282
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,015
AND IS THIS ENOUGH 
WEIGHT, DO WE THINK, 

283
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,484
TO BREAK THE WORLD RECORD? 

284
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,085
WELL, WE'LL 
SOON FIND OUT. 

285
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,587
CHECK IT -- NO. 

286
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:36,388
WE GAINED SOME, 
BUT NO, NOT YET.
 

287
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,390
SO WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING 
THAT ADDS EVEN MORE WEIGHT,
 

288
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,259
AND WE GOT A GREAT IDEA. 

289
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,530
OKAY, AND EVEN DALTON 
CAN GO WITH US ON THIS,
 

290
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,632
'CAUSE HE CAN SIT RIGHT 
ON THE PICNIC TABLE.
 
 

291
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,135
FIRE AWAY, DALTON. 

292
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,237
AND WE'RE JUST OFF LIKE A 
ROCKET DOWN THE HILL,
 

293
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:52,872
UNBELIEVABLE. 

294
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,341
LOOK OUT FOR THE ROCK, 
AND WATCH IT. 

295
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:56,575
WE'RE LOOKIN' GOOD. 
WE'RE LOOKIN' GOOD!
 

296
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,878
UH-OH. 
OH, MAN. 

297
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,713
OKAY, GUYS, 
I KNOW YOU'RE HURTIN', 

298
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,481
BUT HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS... 

299
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,316
WE'RE NOW THE 
WORLD CHAMPS.
 

300
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,952
[applause]

301
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,495
HI, EVERYBODY,
RANGER GORD HERE.

302
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,464
YOU KNOW, IN TONIGHT'S
EDUCATIONAL FILM,

303
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,766
WHICH, OF COURSE,
I WROTE AND DIRECTED,

304
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,701
AND WELL, I DID
ALL THE VOICES

305
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:24,804
AND DREW ALL THE PICTURES,

306
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,440
AND WELL, I CHOREOGRAPHED
MOST OF THE LOVE SCENES.
 

307
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,843
TONIGHT'S EPISODE IS ALL
ABOUT TEACHING YOU

308
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,179
HOW TO TALK TO THE ANIMALS.

309
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:36,348
I LIKE TO CALL THIS EPISODE
"RANGER DOOLITTLE,"

310
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:39,151
WHICH IS, OF COURSE,
JUST A CATCHY NAME
FOR THIS FILM

311
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,554
AND NOT ANY INDICATION OF
WHAT I DO UP HERE

312
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,589
ON A REGULAR BASIS.

313
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,392
REALLY, IT'S NOT.

314
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:50,596
SO ANYWAY, THAT'S THE END OF
THE INTRODUCTION PORTION
OF THE PRESENTATION.
 

315
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,731
NOW WE MOVE ON TO NEXT PORTION
OF THE PRESENTATION,

316
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:56,035
WHICH IS, OF COURSE,
THE MIDDLE PART OF
THE PRESENTATION,

317
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,137
WHICH COMES RIGHT
AFTER THE INTRODUCTION

318
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:02,441
AND OF COURSE,
JUST BEFORE THE, UH,

319
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,844
ENDING.

320
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,745
HERE WE GO.

321
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,883
[quirky upbeat music]

322
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:28,267
WELL, FOLKS, TODAY I'M GONNA
SHOW EVERYONE IN OUR
SOLAR SYSTEM

323
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,936
THAT I CAN TALK
TO THE ANIMALS.

324
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:34,406
THAT'S AWESOME,
RANGER GORD.

325
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,575
YES, IT IS,
HAROLD.

326
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:40,079
HAVE EITHER OF YOU
EVER TALKED TO ANIMALS?

327
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:42,882
UH, I HAVEN'T
PERSONALLY, NO.

328
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:45,751
I SPEAK TO A JACKASS
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

329
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,595
AS YOU CAN SEE,

330
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,430
ANIMALS DON'T APPRECIATE
THAT KIND OF HUMOUR.

331
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,232
THIS IS A MOOSE, HAROLD.

332
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,835
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
TALKING TO IT?

333
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:05,204
ALL RIGHT.
HELLO.

334
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:08,207
UM, MY NAME IS HAROLD.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

335
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:16,682
I THINK MAYBE YOU'RE
GEING JUST A LITTLE
TOO PERSONAL.

336
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,784
I THINK HAROLD'S IN
REAL TROUBLE HERE.

337
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,786
MOOSE ARE VEGETARIAN.

338
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,155
OONGA! WONGA!
DINGY DINGA.

339
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,627
THANK YOU,
RANGER GORD.

340
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,696
WHAT DID YOU
SAY TO HIM?

341
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,565
I SAID, OONGA WONGA
DINGY DINGA.

342
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,801
OH, UH, AND WHAT
DOES THAT MEAN?

343
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,636
NO IDEA, HAROLD.

344
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,572
JUST BECAUSE I SPEAK MOOSE
DOESN'T MEAN I UNDERSTAND IT.

345
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,775
LET'S GO, HAROLD.

346
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,677
NO, HANG ON
A MINUTE.

347
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:47,947
LET'S SEE IF I CAN GET
THAT MOOSE BACK HERE
TO APOLOGIZE.

348
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,649
[speaking gibberish]

349
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:54,019
THAT'S A DUCK.

350
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,454
CLOSE ENOUGH.

351
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,189
TRY TO SAY
SOMETHING TO HIM.

352
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:59,058
UH, NO THANKS.

353
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,260
OH, COME ON.
YOU CAN DO IT.

354
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,728
UH, NO THANKS, GORD.

355
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,964
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE SEEING ME
TALK TO A DUCK.

356
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:07,232
YOU'RE A SNOB,
YOU KNOW THAT, RED?

357
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,569
[speaking gibberish]

358
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,043
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GIVE IT A SHOT HERE.

359
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,013
SO DUCK, HOW WOULD
YOU DESCRIBE RANGER GORD?

360
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:23,716
QUACK.

361
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:36,161
[applause]

362
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,834
IF YOUR GROUND
SEEMS UNUSUALLY SOFT,

363
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,703
IF EACH TIME YOU BREATH,
YOU LET OUT A COUGH,

364
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,806
IF THE COWS ROLL THEIR EYES
AND BARF IN THE TROUGH,

365
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,409
YOU BETTER CALL ROTHSCHILD'S
BEFORE THE LID BLOWS OFF.

366
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,882
[horns honking]

367
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,951
Red: YOU KNOW WHAT
REALLY FRIES MY BACON?

368
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,686
WHEN I'M CRUISING
ALONG THE HIGHWAY,

369
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,888
AND CAR AFTER CAR
COMES UP BEHIND ME

370
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:05,524
AND SWERVES OVER
THE LINE TO PASS.

371
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,326
TO ME IT'S AN INSULT,

372
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,728
LIKE I'M JUST GOIN' SLOW
FOR SPITE OR SOMETHING.

373
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,196
ANYONE WHO KNOWS ME
COULD TELL YOU

374
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,298
I'D GO FASTER IF I COULD.

375
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,667
IF ONLY THERE WAS A WAY TO
STOP THEM FROM PASSING ME.

376
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,303
WELL, THERE IS.

377
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,639
NOW, YOU'RE THINKING I'M MAYBE
GONNA SWITCH TO JET FUEL

378
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,508
OR SUPERCHARGE THE ENGINE

379
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,343
OR MAYBE BUILD SOME KIND
OF A FLAME THROWER

380
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,011
INTO THE BACK OF THE VAN.

381
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,313
AND WHILE THOSE
ARE GREAT IDEAS,

382
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:32,217
I'M GOING WITH SOMETHING THAT
CAPTURES MY TRADEMARK
CREATIVE SUBTLETY.

383
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:35,421
I'M GOING TO BUILD A GIANT
BALLPOINT PEN.

384
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,357
NOW, ALL YOU NEED IS ONE
OF THESE SAFETY PILONS.

385
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,092
I FOUND THIS ONE
JUST UP THE ROAD.

386
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,693
[tires screeching to a halt]

387
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,062
[crash]

388
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,097
OKAY, THEN YOU
JUST GET A HARDBALL,

389
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,665
AND YOU DROP THAT IN THERE.

390
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,400
THAT'S THE BALL OF
YOUR BALLPOINT PEN.

391
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:51,703
YOU'VE ALREADY GOT THE POINT,
WHICH IS TO STOP PEOPLE
FROM PASSING YOU.

392
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,705
OKAY, NOW, TO HOLD
THE BALL IN PLACE

393
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,441
YOU NEED A BIG SPRING.

394
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:56,909
THIS HERE'S A COIL
SPRING OFF A CAR.

395
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:59,178
YOU CAN FIND THOSE
BESIDE ANY POTHOLE.

396
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,380
AND THEN TO HOLD THE WHOLE
ASSEMBLY IN PLACE,

397
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,948
YOU WANNA ATTACH
A FEW PAINT CANS,

398
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,983
ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER.

399
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,418
AND THEN PUNCH A HOLE IN THE
BOTTOM OF EACH ONE.

400
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,787
I'LL EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT
MORE ABOUT THAT LATER.

401
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,557
ATTACH THEM ALL TOGETHER WITH
THE HANDYMAN'S SECRET WEAPON,

402
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,225
DUCT TAPE.

403
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,798
NOW ALL WE DO IS ADD THE INK,

404
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,000
WHICH IN THIS CASE IS PAINT.

405
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,036
THESE PAINT CANS
ACTUALLY WERE EMPTY,

406
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,038
SO I HAD TO ADD
PAINT TO THEM,

407
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,173
AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS IT'S
EXACTLY THE SAME COLOUR

408
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,909
AS THE STUFF THEY USE TO
PAINT HIGHWAY LINES.

409
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,712
THERE'S A
COINCIDENCE, HUH?

410
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,116
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO SEE IF THE
PEN IS MIGHTIER THAN THE
TAILGATER.

411
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:44,490
[horns honking]

412
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,693
REMEMBER NOW,
NO PASSING ON THE SOLID LINE.

413
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:51,864
[horns honking]

414
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:01,573
WELL, THE MASQUERADE MARATHON
IS OFF AND RUNNING.

415
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,409
WEIRD TO SEE PEOPLE IN ANIMAL
COSTUMES RUNNING THROUGH TOWN.

416
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:08,914
LOOKS LIKE FIRE DRILL
AT DISNEY WORLD.

417
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,650
ONLY, THEY STARTED OFF
EARLY FOR SOME REASON.

418
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,986
I GUESS THEY TOOK A LOOK AT
THE CONDITION OF THE ATHLETES

419
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:17,322
AND DECIDED TO ALLOW A LITTLE
MORE TIME FOR IT OR SOMETHING.

420
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:20,425
HEY, RED, LOOKS LIKE MIKE'S
GONNA WIN THE MARATHON.

421
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,094
YOU NOT IN IT,
DALTON?

422
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,063
OH, NO, NO.
JUST GOT THE BAD BACK.

423
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,666
WELL, YOUR FRONT'S
NO TREAT EITHER.

424
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,170
HOW COME THEY
STARTED EARLY?

425
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,905
OH, BIG AL SHOWED UP.

426
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,773
OH, YEAH, MIKE
STARTED RUNNING,

427
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,508
AND EVERYONE THOUGHT
THE RACE HAD STARTED.

428
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,211
OH, GEEZ, MIKE WAS
REALLY MOTORING.

429
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,914
I DIDN'T THINK HE
COULD RUN IN THAT
MATADOR COSTUME.

430
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,515
OH, NO,
HE DIDN'T.

431
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,551
HE CAME UP WITH A WHOLE
DIFFERENT OUTFIT.

432
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:49,888
[laughter and applause]

433
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,064
I WON.

434
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,465
[bemused]
CONGRATULATIONS.

435
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,000
[possum squealing]

436
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,368
MEETING TIME.

437
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,237
YEAH, YOU GUYS GO AHEAD.
I'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.

438
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,005
I FORGOT TO TELL
YOU, MR. GREEN,

439
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,508
I THINK BIG AL MAY
HAVE FOLLOWED ME HERE.

440
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,411
[banging at door]

441
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,219
WHAT'S UP,
MIKE?

442
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,887
OH, NO, NO, NO.
I'M NOT -- I'M NOT --

443
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,790
I'M --
I'M RED GREEN,

444
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,592
AND THIS IS MY --
THIS IS MY --

445
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,428
I'LL SHOW YOU
MY LICENSE.

446
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,764
MY --
MY WALLET'S GONE.

447
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,833
SO MIKE WAS HERE?

448
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,704
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE JUST LEFT.

449
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,212
OKAY, IF MY
WIFE IS WATCHING,

450
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,414
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING,

451
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:52,551
AND WATCH OUT FOR SOME GUY
DRESSED LIKE ME.

452
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,186
HE'S AN EX-CON.

453
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:57,256
HE'S TRYING TO SUB IN
ON MY CONJUGAL VISIT.

454
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,057
TO THE REST OF YOU,
