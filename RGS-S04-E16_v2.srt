A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

WATCH HOW THEY REACT TO
THEIR CAR STARTING
TO RUST.

3
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:11,044
MOST MEN GO NUTS,
MOST WOMEN GO SHOPPING,

00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:12,379
BUT NOT FOR A NEW CAR.

5

SO EXCITED ABOUT RUST.

EQUIVALENT OF GREY HAIR.

8
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,621
IT'S A KILLER TO
REALIZE THAT YOUR
CAR IS MIDDLE AGED.

9
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:23,189
AND IT GETS WORSE
WHEN BODY PARTS

10
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,725
START FALLING OFF
OR FLUIDS START LEAKING.

HIS TRUCK IN TO
BE REPAINTED.

30

PAINT THE VEHICLES
OURSELVES

31
00:01:31,824 --> 00:01:33,159
BUT APPARENTLY THE
LAST TIME WE DID IT,

00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,560
WE DIDN'T CLEAN UP
TOO WELL AND ALL.

WERE STUCK IN THE

IS A PROFESSIONAL TRADE.

YOU PAINT THE WINDOWS,
YOU PAINT THE MIRRORS.

WE CAN DO
IT FOR 30,

42
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,952
THAT MEANS WE CAN PAINT
OUR VEHICLES EVERY
SEASON

43
00:01:59,952 --> 00:02:02,355
AND STILL COME
OUT AHEAD.

44
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:04,290
HOW DO YOU PAINT
A VEHICLE FOR $30?

45
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,092
THE PAINT COSTS
MORE THAN THAT.

46
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:07,493
THE 30 BUCKS IS
FOR THE BEER.

47
00:02:07,493 --> 00:02:10,063
WE STEAL THE PAINT.

48
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,764
I KNEW THERE WAS
A REASON ALL THE
VEHICLES AROUND HERE

49
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:15,268
WERE THE SAME COLOUR
AS THE FIRE HALL.

50
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,573
ANYWAY, WHEN MOOSE
WENT TO SEE THE
PROFESSIONALS,

51
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,341
THEY FOUND A LOT
OF RUST IN HIS TRUCK.

52
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:24,377
THE GUY WITH THE GRINDER,
WHEN HE STARTED
WORKING ON IT,

53
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:25,678
HE FELL IN THROUGH
THE FRONT WHEEL WELL

54
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:27,346
AND COME OUT
THROUGH THE TAILGATE.

55
00:02:27,346 --> 00:02:29,248
THAT'S BECAUSE OF ALL
THE SALT THEY PUT ON

56

UP HERE

YEAH.

58
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:34,153
AND IF TABLE SALT COULD
DO THAT TO A TRUCK,

59
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:35,555
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT
IT DOES TO YOUR BODY,

60
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:38,724
A HUMAN BODY OR
EVEN THAT BODY?

61
00:02:38,724 --> 00:02:40,393
THAT'S SODIUM CHLORIDE.

62
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:42,195
HIGHWAY CREWS USE
CALCIUM CHLORIDE

63
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,163
WHICH IS ANHYDROUS
AND CREATES A
LIQUID BASE

64
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:47,567
THAT ACTUALLY HAS A
FREEZING POINT LESS
THAN THAT OF WATER.

65
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,170
WELL, HAROLD, WE DON'T
CARE WHAT'S CAUSING
THE PROBLEM,

00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,538
WE JUST WANT
A SOLUTION.

67
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:58,644
OH, WELL, THAT WOULD
BE AN AQUEOUS SOLUTION.

72
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:18,531
WELL, I THINK I'LL JUST
STAY OUT OF THE WAY.

73
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:22,468
THAT OUGHT TO GIVE
US A GOOD START.

BUT HERE COMES MOOSE

HIS SHIRT ON

00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:45,958
IT'S SURE NOT A

HIS SNOWMOBILE KEYS

86
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:53,999
OH, THERE'S ALL HIS
TATTOOS OUT THERE TO VIEW

87
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:56,102
SOME OF THEM ARE
REALLY GROOVY

88
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:59,071
AND IT'S REALLY NEAT
WHEN HE WALKS DOWN
THE STREET

89
00:03:59,071 --> 00:04:04,210
IT'S LIKE BEING AT

YOU ABOUT THAT DOG,

95
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,826
THAT WOULD TEND TO
CONTRADICT THAT

00:04:20,826 --> 00:04:22,361
MAN, THAT'S
FUNNY, YOU KNOW.

97

TO DO THEIR
BUSINESS ON.

99
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,969

00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,938
IT'S PURE

00:04:32,938 --> 00:04:35,074
ALL RIGHT, THE FIRST STEP,

102
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,375

THAT OUTSIDE,

103
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,611
OPEN UP ALL THE
WINDOWS AND IF YOU
CAN SALVAGE THE RUG.

104
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,113
ABSOLUTELY.
NOW, IF YOU
CAN'T SALVAGE THE RUG,

105
00:04:41,113 --> 00:04:43,382
REARRANGE THE
FURNITURE A
LITTLE BIT

106
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:47,119
AND TRY TO COVER
THAT TRAGEDY UP.

107
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:50,389
AND DON'T SKIMP
ON THE AIR FRESHENER.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

108
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:54,026
NOW, IF, HOWEVER,
SHE KNOWS WHAT'S
GOING ON,

109
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:58,297
WELL JUST TELL HER,
HONEY, THE DOG IS
OUT IN THE TRUCK.

110
00:04:58,297 --> 00:05:01,233
I COULD NOT FORGIVE

ON YOUR FAVOURITE

112
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:09,875
SO I HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE
BUT TO DRIVE HIM
DOWN MYSELF

113
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:15,180
AND HAVE HIM
PUT TO SLEEP.

114
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,751
NOW, THIS IS A TACTIC THAT
SHOULD ONLY BE USED
BY A PROFESSIONAL.

115
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:22,221
WE CALL THIS PUPPY
POKER, ALL RIGHT?

116
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,923
OF COURSE YOU'RE
BLUFFING BUT YOU
GOT TO PLAY THE HAND.

117
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:29,395
AND IF YOU REALLY WANT
TO UP THE ANTE,
TELL THE KIDS.

118
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,031
NOW, THIS MIGHT SEEM
LIKE EMOTIONAL BLACKMAIL

BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
A DOG HERE, MAN'S

120

THE STAKES ARE AS
HIGH AS YOU CAN GET.

121

HOPEFULLY SHE'LL FOLD,

122
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:43,409
SHE'LL THROW HER
ARMS AROUND FIDO,
PULL HIM OFF OF DEATH ROW.

BUT IF SHE
CALLS YOUR BLUFF,

00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:20,913
I THOUGHT I WOULD
TAKE HANDYMAN CORNER

139
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:23,715
AND SHOW YOU HOW YOU
CAN PREVENT YOUR CAR
FROM AGING, WEATHERING,

RUSTING AND GENERALLY
LOOKING FILTHY

HOW TO BUILD

00:06:29,588 --> 00:06:32,824
A SELF-CONTAINED
AUTOMATIC POWER WASHER

143
00:06:32,824 --> 00:06:35,627
THAT'LL KEEP YOUR CAR
CONTINUOUSLY CLEAN.

144
00:06:35,627 --> 00:06:37,596
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, THE FIRST THING
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED

145
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:40,532
TO MAKE THIS UNIT
ARE SOME SPRINKLERS.

146
00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:43,201
I WOULD RECOMMEND
YOU USE SPRINKLERS.

147
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:44,903
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU
CAN GET SPRINKLERS
PRETTY CHEAP

148
00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:47,239
FROM YOUR NEIGHBOUR'S

NOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
IS TO MOUNT THESE VARIOUS
SPRINKLERS

150
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:52,077
RIGHT ON TO
THE VEHICLE.

151
00:06:52,077 --> 00:06:56,315
YOU CAN USE RIVETS FOR
THAT OR YOU COULD WELD
THEM ON THERE

152
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:57,883
OR IF YOU WORK
FOR THE GOVERNMENT,

153
00:06:57,883 --> 00:07:00,452
YOU PROBABLY HAVE
TIME TO SIT AND
MAGNETIZE THEM.

154
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:08,860
BUT I'M GOING TO USE
THE HANDYMAN SECRET
WEAPON, DUCT TAPE.

155
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,930
NOW YOU'RE GOING
TO NEED A SOURCE
OF WATER,

156
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,332
ONE THAT MOVES ALONG
WITH THE CAR,

157
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:15,567
BECAUSE IT IS A
MOBILE WASH, ISN'T IT?

158
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:18,537
AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE
A SOURCE JUST LIKE
THAT RIGHT HERE,

AND RADIATOR.

160
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,180
NOW, IF WE CAN JUST
THINK OF A WAY TO
TAP INTO THEM.

161
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:31,283
THERE WE GO.
ALL RIGHT.

162

LET'S GIVE OUR MOBILE

[ ENGING REVVING ]

165

WE DON'T HAVE AN
UNLIMITED SUPPLY
OF WATER HERE.

166
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:07,085
YOU DIDN'T THINK
OF THAT, DID YOU?

167
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:08,887
SO WHAT WE HAVE TO
DO IS WE HAVE
TO OF COURSE

168
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:13,625
RECYCLE THE WATER IN
THE SYSTEM BY RECYCLING.

169
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,261
AND HERE IS WHAT YOU
HAVE TO DO TO SOLVE
THAT ONE.

170
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:19,097
YOU GOT TO MEASURE THE
EXACT PERIMETER OF
THE WHOLE CAR

171
00:08:19,097 --> 00:08:22,934
AND THEN YOU GET
EXACTLY THAT SAME

UP LAST YEAR.

177

WE'LL GET THIS DOWN
AND WE'LL HOOK THIS
ALL UP TO THE CAR

LASTS FOREVER EXCEPT
AN ITALIAN WEDDING.

ME A WHILE TO GET
HER ALL DOWN

182
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:58,737
AND HOOKED UP,
SO WHY DON'T WE
GET BACK TO THE SHOW

183
00:08:58,737 --> 00:09:01,773
AND I WILL COME
AND FIND YOU WHEN
I GOT HER ALL DONE.

GOING TO GO LONG,
PROBABLY TOO LONG.

ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN
TO YOU.

NOW YOU MAY TRY
DENIAL FOR A WHILE,

190
00:09:20,091 --> 00:09:21,893
YOU KNOW, BUYING A
TOUPEE OR TWO-SIDED TAPE

191
00:09:21,893 --> 00:09:23,795
OR A TWO-SEATER CAR.

192
00:09:23,795 --> 00:09:27,632
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO,
SOONER OR LATER IT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN.

193
00:09:27,632 --> 00:09:30,201
AND WHEN IT DOES, YOU'LL
KNOW YOU'RE OVER
THE HILL.

194

NOW, IT MAY HAPPEN
NEXT WEEK OR
NEXT MONTH,

RIGHT, SOMEONE
IS GOING

196
00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:40,378
TO INVITE YOU
OVER TO PLAY BRIDGE.

197
00:09:40,378 --> 00:09:42,514
NOW, I KNOW,
DON'T BE ALARMED.

198
00:09:42,514 --> 00:09:46,217
PLAYING BRIDGE IS
A NATURAL PART OF
THE AGING PROCESS.

199
00:09:46,217 --> 00:09:47,652
YOUR PARENTS HAD
TO DEAL WITH IT

200
00:09:47,652 --> 00:09:51,256
AND NOW THAT YOU'RE
OLD, YOU HAVE TO FACE IT.

201
00:09:51,256 --> 00:09:52,924
DON'T FIGHT IT.
JUST GO WITH IT.

202
00:09:52,924 --> 00:09:54,392
BRIDGE IS NOT
THAT BAD OF A GAME.

203
00:09:54,392 --> 00:09:56,227
THERE'S NO LOUD MUSIC
AND YOU DON'T HAVE

WHINING AT YOU FOR
THEIR ALLOWANCE OR
THE CAR KEYS.

00:09:59,097 --> 00:10:00,865
PLUS YOU'RE PLAYING
WITH PEOPLE YOUR OWN AGE,

206
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:04,502
SO THEY'LL BE JUST
AS BORED AS YOU ARE.

207

AND YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE ALONE AT OUR AGE.

BETTER THAN SOLITAIRE.

NO, IT'S COVERED
IN FLIES NOW.

SHOULD MAKE FOR
AN INTERESTING LOOK.

ALL OVER THE GRILL.

SO HOW YOU GOING TO
GET ALL THE HONEY
OFF THE VAN?

231
00:11:12,704 --> 00:11:14,439
WELL, I THOUGHT I'D
JUST DRIVE IT OUT
INTO THE WOODS

232
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:16,340
AND LET THE BEARS
LICK IT OFF

233
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,210
BUT THEN MOOSE THOMPSON
OFFERED TO DO IT FOR ME.

234

THE DRIVING
OR THE LICKING?

00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:26,451
WELL, HE DIDN'T
ASK FOR THE KEYS.

236
00:11:26,451 --> 00:11:29,654

AND TAKE HER BACK
INTO THE WATER PUMP.

GOES UP OVER THE CAR,
COMES OUT THE LITTLE

00:14:02,473 --> 00:14:04,375
IF YOUR BOAT
GETS WRECKED, RIGHT,

295
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,709
AND IT SINKS.
YEAH.

296
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:07,878
CHANCES ARE YOU'RE
GOING TO FIND A
BETTER ONE

297
00:14:07,878 --> 00:14:10,614
IN BETTER
SHAPE FREE AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE LAKE.

298
00:14:10,614 --> 00:14:12,583
OH, NOW THAT IS
AN EXCELLENT
BOATING TIP.

299
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,552
THANK YOU,
GLEN BRACKSTON.

300
00:14:15,552 --> 00:14:17,621
YOU KNOW MAYBE
WE SHOULD DO THAT
WITH OUR VEHICLES,

301
00:14:17,621 --> 00:14:19,023
DROP THEM TO THE
BOTTOM OF THE LAKE

302
00:14:19,023 --> 00:14:20,591
AND STOP THEM
FROM RUSTING, HUH?

303
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:21,859
YEAH, GO AHEAD.

304
00:14:21,859 --> 00:14:23,727
JUST DON'T PUT
THEM NEAR THE
MARINA.

305
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:25,596
NO, PEOPLE WOULDN'T BE
ABLE TO TELL THEM
FROM YOUR BOATS.

306
00:14:27,197 --> 00:14:29,900
Red Green: ANOTHER BIT OF
A FOOTBALL FEATURE ON
THE SHOW THIS WEEK,

307
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,201
BILL IS GOING TO --

308
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:32,736
SOMEONE TOLD ME BILL
DIDN'T HAVE THE BALLS

309
00:14:32,736 --> 00:14:34,305
TO PLAY FOOTBALL BUT
THAT IS OBVIOUSLY
NOT CORRECT.

310
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:36,407
AND THIS WEEK HE THOUGHT
HE'D CONCENTRATE

311
00:14:36,407 --> 00:14:38,776
ON THE
QUARTERBACKING,
THE THROWING.

312
00:14:38,776 --> 00:14:41,445
SO WHAT HE'S DONE
THERE IS HE'S HUNG
A TIRE FROM THE GOAL POST

313
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:43,447
AND THE IDEA IS TO
STEP BACK A FEW FEET

314
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:46,950
AND TRY TO THROW
THE BALL THROUGH
THE HOLE IN THE TIRE.

315
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:51,355
AND IT SOUNDS
A LOT EASIER THAN...

316
00:14:51,355 --> 00:14:54,525
HMMMM.

317
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:57,528
NOW YOU KNOW ONE
OF THE BIGGEST COMMODITIES

318
00:14:57,528 --> 00:14:59,697
YOU HAVE IN YOUR LIFE
IS OF COURSE IS
YOUR TIME.

319
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:02,199
YOU KNOW THEY SAY THAT
ONE YEAR IN A DOG'S LIFE

320
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:04,068
IS EQUIVALENT TO,
I BELIEVE,

321
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:07,604
SEVEN YEARS IN
THE LIFE OF A HUMAN.

322
00:15:07,604 --> 00:15:09,840
WELL, I CAN TELL YOU,
ONE HOUR WITH BILL

323
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,243
IS LIKE SEVEN YEARS
OF A DOG'S LIFE.

324
00:15:13,243 --> 00:15:16,480
SO I'M STANDING THERE
WATCHING MY LIFE GO BY

325
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,782
WHILE MY DOGS
ARE KILLING ME.

326
00:15:18,782 --> 00:15:22,953
BILL HAS NO CHANCE OF
DOING WHAT'S RIGHT.

327
00:15:22,953 --> 00:15:24,555
HE'S GETTING CLOSER.

328
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:26,223
MAYBE I SHOULD
GIVE THIS A TRY.

329
00:15:26,223 --> 00:15:27,791
WHAT DO YOU THINK, BILL?

330
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,526
NO?
NO.

331
00:15:29,526 --> 00:15:31,261
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

332
00:15:31,261 --> 00:15:32,996
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

333
00:15:32,996 --> 00:15:34,431
OKAY.
OKAY.

334
00:15:34,431 --> 00:15:36,366
WE'RE GOING TO DO A
BIT OF A PASS PLAY HERE.

335
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:37,301
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, BILL?

336
00:15:37,301 --> 00:15:39,102
WHAT IS THAT?
WHAT IS THAT?

337
00:15:39,102 --> 00:15:40,637
OH IT'S A TOWEL, A TOWEL.

338
00:15:40,637 --> 00:15:42,372
OH MY GOSH, HE'S
SEEN THOSE GAMES
WHERE THEY HAVE ALL THE --

339
00:15:42,372 --> 00:15:44,741
THE CENTRE AS THAT
TOWEL SO HE CAN WIPE --

340
00:15:44,741 --> 00:15:46,844
OH, BILL, BILL, BILL, BILL.

341
00:15:46,844 --> 00:15:48,712
CAN WE GO BILL?
CAN WE GO NOW?

342
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:51,548
GIVE ME THAT.
GIVE ME THAT.

343
00:15:51,548 --> 00:15:53,917
YOUR HANDS ARE FINE.
ALL RIGHT.

344
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:56,653
SNAP THE BALL UP TO
BILL AND HEAD OUT
OF MY PATTERN --

345
00:15:56,653 --> 00:16:00,224
OH, SORRY, BILL.
SNAP AGAIN.

346
00:16:00,224 --> 00:16:02,426
SNAP AGAIN.
OH.

347
00:16:02,426 --> 00:16:04,194
BILL, YOU GOT TO --
YOU GOT TO --

348
00:16:04,194 --> 00:16:08,031
BILL.
OH, MY GOODNESS.

349
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:09,700
TWO MINUTE WARNING.

350
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,202
I'M ON THE PASS --
COME ON, BILL,

351
00:16:12,202 --> 00:16:14,037
TOSS IT.
I'M WIDE OPEN.

352
00:16:14,037 --> 00:16:15,973
I'M WIDE OPEN.
I'M WIDE OPEN.

353
00:16:15,973 --> 00:16:17,674
I SMELL TOUCHDOWN.

354
00:16:17,674 --> 00:16:18,809
YOU GOING TO GRAB
THE BALL BILL?

355
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:20,444
SOFT HANDS.
YOU GOT SOFT HANDS.

356
00:16:20,444 --> 00:16:22,479
SOFT SOMETHING.

357
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:25,382
OH, FOR GOSH SAKE.

358
00:16:25,382 --> 00:16:27,317
TOO LATE, BILL.
TOO LATE.

359
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:29,319
TOO LATE.
FORGET IT.

360
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:31,355
I'M BACK.

361
00:16:31,355 --> 00:16:32,622
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO NOW?

362
00:16:32,622 --> 00:16:34,291
NO, NO, NOT
A HAND OFF.

363
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,959
ALL RIGHT, BILL,
YOU CROUCH DOWN.

364
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:38,395
MY TURN.
I'LL BE THE QUARTERBACK.

365
00:16:38,395 --> 00:16:40,230
I'LL SHOW YOU
HOW IT'S DONE.

366
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,732
WHAT'S GOING ON?

367
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:44,735
I DON'T NEED
THE STUPID TOWEL.

368
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:46,770
SOMETHING ELSE I'D
WIPE MY HANDS ON.

369
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,271
THERE WE GO.
THERE WE GO.

370
00:16:48,271 --> 00:16:50,307
GET TOUGH.
GET TOUGH.

371
00:16:50,307 --> 00:16:51,975
COME ON, BILL.
THERE WE GO.

372
00:16:51,975 --> 00:16:55,512
YOUR HANDS ARE ALL
KIND OF MOIST NOW
AND OUT HE GOES.

373
00:16:55,512 --> 00:16:58,448
GO DEEP.
GO DEEP.

374
00:16:58,448 --> 00:17:00,917
THAT'S A SITE TO
BE SEEN, ISN'T IT?

375
00:17:00,917 --> 00:17:02,652
YOU LOOK GOOD
IN A SKIRT, BILL.

376
00:17:02,652 --> 00:17:04,387
THERE YOU GO.
THAT'S BETTER.

377
00:17:04,387 --> 00:17:05,722
TURN AROUND.

378
00:17:05,722 --> 00:17:06,957
LET ME DRILL IT
OUT TO YOU.

379
00:17:06,957 --> 00:17:08,358
I GOT A GOOD ARM.
HERE IS COMES.

380
00:17:08,358 --> 00:17:09,860
LIKE A BULLET.
LIKE A SHOTGUN.

381
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,129
LIKE A RIFLE.
OH, MY GOSH.

382
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:14,664
WELL, HE DUCKED.
ALL RIGHT.

383
00:17:14,664 --> 00:17:17,200
A LITTLE WEDGY ADJUSTMENT
AND I THINK WE'LL GET

384
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,836
BILL BACK TO AS
NORMAL AS HE GETS.

385
00:17:19,836 --> 00:17:24,241
THERE YOU GO.
THAT'S MY MAN.

386
00:17:26,643 --> 00:17:28,979
Red Green: COMING UP,
I CAN PROVE THAT IF YOU
EAT ENOUGH SALT

387
00:17:28,979 --> 00:17:31,114
YOU WILL
ACTUALLY RUST

388
00:17:31,114 --> 00:17:35,685
AND DALTON TRIES
TO KEEP A STRAIGHT
FACE GIVING YOU A PRICE.

389
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:41,324
WELL, THIS SUBMERGING
THE VEHICLES FOR
THE WINTER THING

390
00:17:41,324 --> 00:17:43,927
I DON'T THINK IS GOING
TO WORK OUT SO WELL.

391
00:17:43,927 --> 00:17:45,529
YOU KNOW, UNCLE RED,
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO TAKE

392
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:47,731
EVERY SUGGESTION
SOMEBODY GIVES YOU.

393
00:17:47,731 --> 00:17:50,667
YOU CAN SAY NO, TOO.

394
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,035
HAROLD, IF I TOOK
EVERY SUGGESTION,

395
00:17:52,035 --> 00:17:55,372
YOU WOULDN'T BE
HERE, BELIEVE ME.

396
00:17:55,372 --> 00:17:59,309
ANYWAY, WE TRIED
THE SINKING THING WITH
STINKY PETERSON'S TRABANT.

397
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:01,811
WE GOT HER DOWN THERE
AND A LOT OF THE STUFF

398
00:18:01,811 --> 00:18:04,981
FLOATED OUT FROM UNDER
THE SEATS AND MADE OUR
EYES WATER

399
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:08,718
AND KILLED A HALF
A DOZEN ROCK BASS.

400
00:18:08,718 --> 00:18:10,186
YOU CANNOT LEAVE
HIS CAR DOWN THERE.

401
00:18:10,186 --> 00:18:11,921
IT'S AN
ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARD.

402
00:18:11,921 --> 00:18:15,191
WHEREAS YOU'RE
JUST A MENTAL HAZARD.

403
00:18:15,191 --> 00:18:17,327
WE'RE GOING TO GET THE
CAR OUT OF THERE.

404
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:19,663
THAT'S WHAT THE
JUMPER CABLES ARE FOR.

405
00:18:19,663 --> 00:18:22,032
UNCLE RED, IT'S NOT
GOING TO START
UNDER WATER.

406
00:18:22,032 --> 00:18:24,234
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
PULL IT OUT WITH
A CHAIN?

407
00:18:24,234 --> 00:18:25,702
DID YOU ALSO
CONSIDER, YOU KNOW,

408
00:18:25,702 --> 00:18:28,505
YOU CAN LIGHTEN
THE CAR'S LOAD IF YOU
WIND UP ALL THE WINDOWS

409
00:18:28,505 --> 00:18:30,040
AND FILL IT FULL OF AIR
FROM A BICYCLE PUMP?

410
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,877
YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE'RE DOING, HAROLD.
IT WON'T WORK.

411
00:18:33,877 --> 00:18:36,279
'CAUSE STINKY'S
SUNROOF IS STUCK OPEN.

412
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:40,917
YOU DO NOT
TAKE ENOUGH TIME TO
THINK THINGS THROUGH.

413
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:42,352
YOU'RE RIGHT, HAROLD.

414
00:18:42,352 --> 00:18:43,753
I'M GOING TO TAKE
TWO HOURS RIGHT NOW

415
00:18:43,753 --> 00:18:45,455
AND I'M GOING
TO PLAN EVERY
DETAIL ON THIS.

416
00:18:45,455 --> 00:18:48,792
EXCELLENT.
I'LL BE LYING
ON YOUR BED.

417
00:18:56,433 --> 00:18:58,535
Red Green: YOU KNOW
THEY SAY THERE'S A
PLACE FOR EVERYTHING

418
00:18:58,535 --> 00:19:00,003
AND EVERYTHING
IN ITS PLACE.

419
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:01,504
AND HERE WE ARE OUT
BY THE MAIN HIGHWAY

420
00:19:01,504 --> 00:19:05,175
AT THE
EVERYTHING PLACE,
DALTON HUMPHREY'S STORE.

421
00:19:05,175 --> 00:19:06,976
DALTON, PEOPLE
MIGHT DRIVE BY
THIS PLACE

422
00:19:06,976 --> 00:19:08,578
AND ASSUME THAT
IT WAS A JUNK YARD.

423
00:19:08,578 --> 00:19:13,349
WELL, YOU KNOW,
RED, ONE MAN'S JUNK
IS ANOTHER MAN'S OBJET D'ART.

424
00:19:13,349 --> 00:19:17,587
NOW, WHAT DO YOU
THINK THIS IS, HUH?

425
00:19:17,587 --> 00:19:19,155
I WOULD CALL
THAT SCRAP METAL.

426
00:19:19,155 --> 00:19:20,957
YEAH.
TO YOU AND ME MAYBE.

427
00:19:20,957 --> 00:19:22,792
BUT TO SOMEONE FROM
THE CITY, THAT'S A
PRECIOUS LITTLE

428
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:27,163
DECORATOR ACCENT THAT
JUST OOZES CHARM
AND HISTORY.

429
00:19:27,163 --> 00:19:30,533
30 BUCKS WORTH OF
CHARM AND HISTORY.
NO KIDDING.

430
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:33,269
IMAGINE WHAT YOU'D GET
IF YOU FIXED IT AND
PAINTED HER?

431
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:35,038
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU
DROP THIS BY THE
LODGE LATER ON,

432
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:37,373
WE'LL SLAP A COAT OF
PAINT ON THAT WHILE
WE'RE DOING OUR CARS.

433
00:19:37,373 --> 00:19:38,808
THAT'S A LOT OF
WORK THERE, YOU KNOW.

434
00:19:38,808 --> 00:19:40,543
YOU JUST CAN'T
PAINT METAL.

435
00:19:40,543 --> 00:19:42,345
YOU GOT TO SCRAPE
ALL THE RUST OFF.

436
00:19:42,345 --> 00:19:44,013
YOU'LL WANT TO DO
THAT WITH YOUR
CARS, TOO,

437
00:19:44,013 --> 00:19:46,149
OTHERWISE THE RUST
JUST COMES RIGHT
THROUGH.

438
00:19:46,149 --> 00:19:48,051
OH MAN, THAT'S
A LOT OF WORK.

439
00:19:48,051 --> 00:19:49,719
WELL, SEE, I'M NOT GOING
TO DO IT TO THAT PIECE

440
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:51,187
BECAUSE THAT WOULD
RUIN ITS VALUE.

441
00:19:51,187 --> 00:19:54,290
IT HAS TO BE IN
UNRESTORED CONDITION.
