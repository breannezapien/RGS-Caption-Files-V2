1
00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:03,269
IF YOU'RE A
MARRIED MAN YOU KNOW

2
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:05,605
THERE ARE CERTAIN TIMES WHEN
YOUR WIFE WANTS YOU
TO FALL ASLEEP

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,974
AND CERTAIN TIMES
WHEN SHE DOESN'T.

4
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:12,645
FALLING ASLEEP IS
ALMOST ALWAYS ENCOURAGED.

5
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:14,414
BUT IN THE LIVING ROOM,

6
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:16,249
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE
WATCHING OPRAH TOGETHER,

7
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:18,084
OR YOUR WIFE'S IN
THE MIDDLE OF DISCUSSING

8
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,186
YOUR MUCH-NEEDED
BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION,

9
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:22,422
FALLING ASLEEP
IS NOT SO GOOD.

10
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,291
SO WHAT I'VE DONE IS
CUSTOMIZED MY FAVOURITE CHAIR,

11
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,093
SO IT'S GONNA
HELP KEEP ME AWAKE

12
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,662
WHENEVER I'M BEING CRITICIZED
OR A RELATIVE DROPS OVER.

13
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:31,631
SEE, THIS HERE'S
A CAR BATTERY.

14
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,167
I'VE GOT THAT WIRED INTO
WHAT WAS LEFT OF MY
WINDSHIELD WIPER

15
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:36,069
AFTER THE CARWASH
GOT DONE WITH IT.

16
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,738
OKAY, SO NOW I JUST
HOOK UP THE BATTERY,

17
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:41,741
AND I'VE GOT THE WHOLE
SYSTEM WIRED THROUGH
THIS CLOTHES PEG,

18
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,877
KIND OF A DEADMAN SWITCH.

19
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:45,879
SO AS LONG AS I'M AWAKE,
I'M SQUEEZING THE PEG --

20
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:47,080
SO TO SPEAK --

21
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,182
AND THE WHOLE UNIT
IS SHUT OFF.

22
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:52,886
BUT AS SOON AS I FALL
ASLEEP AND START RELAXING,

23
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:55,088
THE WINDSHIELD
WIPER COMES ON,

24
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,390
AND STARTS POKING ME
IN THE BACK AND WAKES ME UP.

25
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,794
OKAY, LET'S HAVE A LITTLE
DEMONSTRATION HERE.

26
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,830
I'LL JUST SIT HERE
UNTIL I FALL ASLEEP.

27
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,799
LET'S SEE.
WHAT COULD MAKE ME DROWSY?

28
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,667
OH, I KNOW.

29
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,803
GET THE CAMERAMAN THERE
TO TALK ABOUT HAVING
HIS COLOURS DONE.

30
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:17,277
[snoring]

31
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:43,069
[cheers and applause]

32
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,640
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

33
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,776
OH, I APPRECIATE THAT.

34
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:52,679
WELL, BIG, BIG WEEK AT
THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

35
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:55,115
YEAH, WE ACTUALLY SUPPORT
A LOCAL CHARITY

36
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,951
THAT'S LOOKING FOR A CURE
FOR MALE PATTERN BALDNESS.

37
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,754
LAST NIGHT THEY HAD
THEIR ANNUAL CHARITY DANCE.

38
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,224
IT'S CALLED THE HAIR BALL.

39
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,993
I TELL YOU, PEOPLE
REALLY COUGH UP THE CASH.

40
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,729
UNCLE RED.

41
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,631
OKAY, DID YOU NOTICE
LAST NIGHT AT THE PARTY

42
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,600
I WAS THE ONLY
PERSON WITHOUT A DATE?

43
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,902
NO, MIKE DIDN'T
HAVE A DATE.

44
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:18,805
THAT WOMAN WAS
HIS PAROLE OFFICER.

45
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:21,741
EVEN STILL, YOU KNOW,
EVERYONE AROUND HERE

46
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:23,543
EITHER HAS A GIRLFRIEND
OR A WIFE OR SOMETHING.

47
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,712
EXCEPT ME.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

48
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:28,348
IT'S ONLY A HALF-HOUR
SHOW, HAROLD.

49
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:31,484
WELL, HAVE YOU ASKED
ANY OF THE GIRLS OUT
AROUND HERE?

50
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,353
THERE'S PLENTY OF
THEM IN THE AREA.

51
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,488
YES!
I ASKED EVERYONE.

52
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,457
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S WEIRD?
ON FRIDAY NIGHTS

53
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,427
EVERY GIRL IN THIS AREA
EITHER WASHES HER HAIR
OR DOES HER LAUNDRY.

54
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,696
I'M VERY CONCERNED
WHAT ALL THAT SOAP RUN-OFF

55
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,099
IS GOING TO DO
TO THE ECOSYSTEM.

56
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,601
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GO TO WHERE YOU CAN
MEET GIRLS,

57
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,803
LIKE GO TO THE
LAUNDROMAT OR THE
SHAMPOO STORE.

58
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,339
YEAH, I'VE EVEN GOT
A BETTER IDEA THAN THAT.

59
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,141
IS THAT OUR LOCAL
YELLOW PAGES?

60
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,844
YEAH, BOTH OF 'EM.

61
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:02,015
LOOK AT THIS...
VIDEO DATING SERVICE.

62
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,484
YEAH, YOU MAKE A
VIDEO TAPE OF YOURSELF,
TALKING ABOUT YOURSELF,

63
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,686
AND THEN YOU SEND IT TO THIS
COMPANY, RIGHT, VIDEOMATE.

64
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,555
AND THAT WAY,
YOUR PROSPECTIVE DATE,

65
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:11,925
SHE GETS TO HEAR AND SEE ME
BEFORE SHE MEETS ME.

66
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,661
OKAY, BUT YOU'RE SAYING THAT
LIKE IT'S A GOOD THING.

67
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,796
[laughter]

68
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,665
DON'T BE SO NEGATIVE.

69
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,600
YOUR GENERATION DIDN'T
HAVE VIDEO DATING,

70
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,435
AND LOOK AT ALL THE HORRIBLE
MISTAKES THEY MADE.

71
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,270
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

72
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,706
AUNT BERNICE.

73
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,609


74
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:38,851
IT'S TIME FOR THE
POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

75
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:42,855
[cheers and applause]

76
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,897
UH, TONIGHT'S WINNER WILL
RECEIVE THIS COUPON

77
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:54,234
FOR TWO HOURS ALONE
WITH A FINICKY LAWN MOWER

78
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,936
AND A 10-POUND
SLEDGE HAMMER.

79
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,838
NO QUESTIONS ASKED.

80
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,506
OKAY, COVER YOUR EARS.

81
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,675
AND NOW MR. GREEN
YOU'VE GOT 30 SECONDS

82
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,544
TO GET DALTON
TO SAY THIS WORD...

83
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,248
YEAH,
ALL RIGHT, MIKE.

84
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,250
AND... GO!

85
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,485
OKAY, DALTON,
YOUR CLOTHES, YOUR SHOES,

86
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:15,488
THE CAR YOU DRIVE ARE ALL
PART OF YOUR PERSONAL...

87
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:18,524
COMMITMENT
TO RECYCLING.

88
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,027
NO, NO, NO.
I'M TALKING ABOUT --

89
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,029
WELL, LIKE YOUR HAIR.

90
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,966
IT LOOKS THAT WAY BECAUSE
OF YOUR SPECIAL...

91
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,902
UH, UH, VACUUM
CLEANER ATTACHMENT!

92
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,672
NO, OKAY.
OKAY, OKAY.

93
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,742
LET'S SAY YOU WERE GONNA
TAKE ANN MARIE ON A
WORLD CRUISE.

94
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,177
SO YOU BOUGHT A WHOLE NEW
WARDROBE OF CRUISE WEAR.

95
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,213
YOU'VE GOT THE BEST
STATE ROOM ON THE
WHOLE SHIP,

96
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,315
AND YOU DID EVERYTHING
FIRST CLASS ALL THE WAY.

97
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:45,151
PEOPLE WOULD SAY, DALTON,
YOU'RE REALLY GOING IN...

98
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:47,820
SANE!

99
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:50,490
ALMOST OUTTA
TIME, MR. GREEN.

100
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,091
YEAH, OKAY.

101
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,294
DALTON, ANN MARIE LIKES
TO GO SHOPPING ALL THE TIME

102
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,628
BECAUSE SHE WANTS
TO STAY IN...

103
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,297
DEBT.

104
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,198
THE WOMAN SPENDS MONEY LIKE
IT'S GOIN' OUTTA STYLE.

105
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:01,467
THERE WE GO!

106
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,874
[quirky upbeat music]

107
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:12,745
HEY! RED GREEN!
WHAT A BIG SURPRISE!

108
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,715
YOU ASKED ME TO
COME HERE, GORD.

109
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,917
I KNOW, BUT I LIKE
MAKING A BIG FUSS
OVER MY VISITORS.

110
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,786
THAT WAY THEY
MIGHT STAY LONGER.

111
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,454
WHAT DO YOU LIKE
HAVING FOR BREAKFAST?

112
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:23,556
A CONVERSATION
WITH MY WIFE.

113
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,258
RIGHT. OKAY.
MESSAGE TAKEN.

114
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,160
ABSOLUTELY.

115
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:29,162
WITH RANGER GORD THERE'S
NO STRINGS ATTACHED.

116
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:31,764
YOU'RE FREE TO COME
AND GO AS YOU PLEASE.

117
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,000
OH, PLEASE DON'T GO!

118
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,703
[weeping]

119
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,204
OKAY. OKAY.

120
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,442
YEAH, PLEASE.
LET'S SIT DOWN.

121
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,310
WHAT DID YOU WANT TO
TALK TO ME ABOUT, GORD?

122
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,813
YEAH, RIGHT.
ABOUT MY NEW CAREER.

123
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,648
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

124
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,884
RED, WHEN YOU THINK
ABOUT ME AND MY LIFE,

125
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,220
WHAT'S THE BIGGEST MISTAKE
YOU THINK I'VE MADE?

126
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:03,329
WELL, THERE'S SO MANY
TO CHOOSE FROM, GORD.

127
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:07,200
NO, BEING AN
EMPLOYEE. 

128
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,968
OKAY, THAT'S THE BIG ONE,
BUT NO MORE.

129
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,903
I'VE DECIDED
TO GO FREELANCE.

130
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,505
A FREELANCE
FOREST RANGER?

131
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,340
OH, SURE, SURE.
ABSOLUTELY.

132
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,809
FOREST FIRES CAN SPOIL
ALMOST ANY SOCIAL EVENT,

133
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,412
WEDDINGS,
BAR MITZVAHs,

134
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:22,615
EVER BEEN A FOREST FIRE
AT A BAR MITZVAH?

135
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,451
NOT YET,
BUT WHY TAKE THE CHANCE?

136
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,653
AND THERE'S PLENTY
OF OTHER OPPORTUNITIES...

137
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,822
STRIP MALLS,
RETIREMENT VILLAGES.

138
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,725
I MEAN, COME ON, RED,
OLD PEOPLE WITH BARBECUES?

139
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,161
WHOO!

140
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,997
HERE'S MY NEW
BUSINESS CARD.

141
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,767
"RANGER GORD,
FREELANCE FOREST RANGER.

142
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,936
"WHERE THERE'S
SMOKE THERE'S GORD."

143
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,672
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD
PASS THAT OUT TO EVERYBODY.

144
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,074
WELL, DO YOU HAVE
ANY MORE OF THEM?

145
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,042
I DID,
BUT THEY BURNED.

146
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,978
YEAH, I WAS HOPING YOU
COULD READ THE INFORMATION

147
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:55,481
AND THEN PASS IT ON, KIND OF
LIKE A CHAIN BUSINESS CARD.

148
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,751
BUT THERE'S NO PHONE
NUMBER ON HERE, GORD.

149
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:02,121
YEAH, RED, I DON'T
HAVE A PHONE.

150
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,425
OKAY, UH, YOU KNOW,
YOU MAY NEED TO RETHINK
THIS WHOLE THING.

151
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,994
LIKE, WHAT IS YOUR
INCOME RIGHT NOW?

152
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,696
OH, GEE, DO YOU NEED
AN EXACT AMOUNT?

153
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,432
NO, JUST
BALLPARK IT.

154
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:15,535
OKAY, UH...

155
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,144
ZERO.

156
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,712
UH-HUH. OKAY.

157
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,681
SO ANY ADDITIONAL FREELANCE
INCOME THAT YOU MAKE

158
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,416
IS GONNA PUT YOU IN
A HIGHER TAX BRACKET.

159
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,020
RIGHT.

160
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:35,788
OKAY, SO I'M
GETTING FROM YOU

161
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,124
THAT YOU THINK I'M BETTER OFF
IF I STAY IN THE TOWER.

162
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:41,093
GORD, YOU STAY IN THE TOWER,
EVERYBODY'S BETTER OFF.

163
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,931


164
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:53,239
YOU KNOW, AROUND HERE WE GET
OUR DRINKING WATER FROM
POSSUM LAKE.

165
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,308
YEARS AGO THAT
NEVER BOTHERED ME.

166
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,276
BUT OF COURSE, BACK THEN YOU
COULD GET A SIX-PACK

167
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,111
FOR ONLY $1.79.

168
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,813
SO THIS TIME ON
HANDYMAN CORNER,

169
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,516
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU HOW
YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN WATER.

170
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,053
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA
START WITH RAIN WATER

171
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,721
COMING RIGHT OFF THE ROOF.

172
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,356
THIS IS PURE,
UNPOLLUTED WATER

173
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,991
COMING STRAIGHT
FROM HEAVEN.

174
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,893
ALL WE GOTTA DO IS
FILTER OUT THE LEAVES

175
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,696
AND THE BIRD FEATHERS
AND THE MOLDY CHESTNUTS.

176
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:19,599
AND BOIL HER ALL UP,
AND WE'RE BEATIN' THE SYSTEM.

177
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:23,035
OKAY, FIRST THING YOU WANNA
DO IS TAKE OFF YOUR DOWNSPOUT.

178
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,972
CUT A SLOT IN HER,
DOWN AT THE ONE END.

179
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:29,475
THAT'S YOUR FIRST STAGE
FILTRATION RIGHT THERE.

180
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,977
TO CATCH THE
FINER STUFF...

181
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,045
PANTYHOSE.

182
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,214
NOT JUST FOR
HOLD-UPS ANYMORE.

183
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,318
OH, I GOT A RUN.

184
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,889
OKAY, NOW YOU WOULD
JUST RUN YOUR DOWNPIPE

185
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,757
JUST RIGHT OFF THE END
OF THE BUILDING THERE,

186
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,959
BUT I PUT THIS
EXTENSION ON OURS,

187
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,161
BECAUSE THERE'S A
WET SPOT OVER THERE

188
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,830
AND WHAT LOOKS LIKE MOOSE
THOMPSON'S FOOTPRINTS.

189
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,899
I JUST --

190
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,767
OKAY, WHAT I'M GONNA
DO NOW THEN

191
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,602
IS JUST JAM THIS UP IN HERE.

192
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,271
AND THAT TAKES CARE
OF OUR FILTRATION UNIT.

193
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,740
NOW WE NEED SOMETHING THAT
WILL CATCH THE WATER AND
THEN DISTILL IT.

194
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,542
I WANTED SOMETHING
SMALL AND PORTABLE

195
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,610
THAT HAD THE SAME
ENGINEERING SOPHISTICATION

196
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,679
AS THOSE HIGH END WATER
PURIFICATION PLANTS

197
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,181
THEY USE IN THE LARGER
METROPOLIS AREAS.

198
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,716
AND I THINK I'VE DONE IT.

199
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,285
[chuckles]

200
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:15,821
OH, YEAH, METAL CONTAINER HERE
GONNA CATCH MY FILTERED
RAIN WATER;

201
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,157
BARBECUE MAKES IT BOIL;

202
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,693
AND THE WAGON
MAKES IT PORTABLE.

203
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,497
NOW I JUST NEED
IT TO RAIN.

204
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,411
[thunder crashes]

205
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,646
OKAY SO I'M STANDING OUT IN
FRONT OF THE LODGE

206
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,214
WAITING FOR THE
RAIN TO STOP

207
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,950
SO I CAN TEST MY
DRINKING WATER,

208
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,218
AND THIS SMART GUY DROPPED
50 CENTS IN MY TIN CUP.

209
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,254
[change jingling]

210
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,357
PEOPLE ARE SO CHEAP.

211
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,125
OKAY, LET'S SEE WHAT
WE'VE GOT HERE.

212
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,665
[searing sound]

213
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,942
OH, IT'S HOT.

214
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,677
IT'S LIKE A FLAVOURED TEA.

215
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,349
KIND OF A SHINGLE/PEKOE.

216
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,117
I'M SURE YOU CAN
GET USED TO IT.

217
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,319
BUT THE MAIN POINT IS THAT
YOU'RE PROVIDING SOMETHING

218
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,021
FOR YOURSELF
AND YOUR FAMILY

219
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,623
THAT YOU KNOW
IS COMPLETELY SAFE.

220
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,992
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME --

221
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:38,671
(discouraged)
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

222
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,744
[applause]

223
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:51,384
[quirky upbeat music]

224
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,153
ANY OF YOU GUYS WITH A FULL
HEALTHY HEAD OF HAIR

225
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,956
MIGHT WANT TO IGNORE
THIS PART.

226
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,191
BUT FOR THE REST OF US,

227
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:02,928
I WANNA TALK A LITTLE
BIT ABOUT BALD SPOTS.

228
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:06,365
YOU CAN NEVER BE FULLY
PREPARED FOR A BALD SPOT.

229
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,834
THEY KINDA CREEP
UP ON YOU.

230
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,936
AND THEY COME
UP FROM BEHIND,

231
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:14,640
SO YOU'RE USUALLY THE
LAST ONE TO EVEN FIND OUT.

232
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,209
AND I BELIEVE
THAT A BALD SPOT

233
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:21,147
IS SOME ALIEN LIFE FORM
OF SOME TYPE.

234
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,582
IT'S A LOT MORE SENSITIVE
THAN THE REST OF YOUR SKIN.

235
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,317
I MEAN, IT SUNBURNS
REAL EASY.

236
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,254
IT'S THE FIRST THING
THAT FEELS COLD OR RAIN.

237
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,289
IT'S THE FIRST THING TO
SWEAT IF YOU'RE IN TROUBLE

238
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:33,759
OR EATING MEXICAN FOOD
OR BOTH.

239
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,930
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE IT'S A
LOT YOUNGER THAN THE REST
OF YOUR SKIN.

240
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,366
I MEAN, EVERYTHING ELSE
IS MAYBE 50 YEARS OLD,

241
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:43,202
BUT YOUR BALD SPOT'S ONLY BEEN
AROUND FOR THE LAST THREE.

242
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,041
THAT'S WHY IT'S
SO SMOOTH AND PERKY.

243
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,077
SO INSTEAD OF THINKING
OF A BALD SPOT

244
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,112
AS AN EMBARRASSING
SIGN OF

245
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,614
OLD AGE AND
RAMPANT DECAY.

246
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:59,652
WHY DON'T YOU
THINK OF IT AS SEXY?

247
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:02,621
THEY SAY HAIR LOSS IS FROM
HAVING TOO MUCH TESTOSTERONE,

248
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:05,157
SO THAT'S A
PRETTY GOOD START.

249
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:09,662
I'VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED
THAT IT'S SMOOTH AND
REAL SENSITIVE.

250
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,931
SO I'M SUGGESTING
THAT A BALD SPOT

251
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:15,601
IS THE ULTIMATE
EROGENOUS ZONE,

252
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:18,137
A POWERFUL LOVE BADGE
THAT'S ONLY GIVEN

253
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:21,407
TO THE MOST MANLY OF MEN.

254
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:26,011
THERE.
NOW DO YOU FEEL
BETTER ABOUT YOUR BALD SPOT?

255
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,880
ME NEITHER.

256
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,483
REMEMBER,
I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

257
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,551
WE'RE ALL IN
THIS TOGETHER.

258
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,891
WHEN THE AIR AT YOUR
PLACE GIVES YOU THE BENDS;

259
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,794
WHEN YOU'VE LOST ALL CONTACT
WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS;

260
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,296
I HAVE A TRUCK THAT
PUMPS AS IT MENDS.

261
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,665
'CAUSE THIS IS WHERE
THE FOOD CHAIN ENDS.

262
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,571
OKAY, I'M READY FOR
MY CLOSE-UP, PEOPLE.

263
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,708
LET'S GO!

264
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,643
THIS IS THE ONLY TAPE
I COULD FIND, HAROLD.

265
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,746
THAT CAMERA'S SOME KIND OF
DISCONTINUED, ONE-OFF FORMAT.

266
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,620
"THETA-MAX

"MADE IN
PORTUGUESE MACAU."

268
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:14,059
OKAY, WELL,
ALL YOU'VE GOTTA DO

269
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,995
IS PROVIDE THE
LIGHTS AND THE CAMERA,

270
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,264
AND I'LL PROVIDE
THE ACT-SHUN!

271
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:20,833
HERE WE GO.

272
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,943
Red: OKAY.
AND... CAMERA'S ON.

273
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,978
ACTION, HAROLD.

274
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,855
I SAID,
ACTION, HAROLD. GO!

275
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,590
I AM GOING.

276
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,425
THIS PAUSE IS PART
OF MY VIDEO.

277
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,027
NOT A GOOD
IDEA, HAROLD.

278
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,129
YOU'RE GIVING HER
TIME TO CHANGE HER MIND.

279
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,500
[affected British accent]
OH, I'M SORRY.

280
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,168
I DIDN'T HEAR
YOU COME IN.

281
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,436
WELL, I JUST CAME IN.
I WAS JUST TALKING TO YOU.

282
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:58,838
I JUST CAME UPSTAIRS --

283
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,039
NOT YOU!

284
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:01,874
MY DATE!

285
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,577

PLEASE, PLEASE FORGIVE MY
TECHNICAL ASSISTANT.

00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:10,516
ALLOW ME TO
INTRODUCE MYSELF.

00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,551
I'M HAROLD GREEN.

289
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:17,323
AND MIGHT I SAY YOU LOOK
LOVELY THIS EVENING
AND/OR DAY.

290
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:20,860
THAT IT?

291
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,261
Harold: NO! SHH!

292
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:23,863
I'M LISTENING TO WHAT
THE YOUNG, LOVELY,

293
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:27,266
FUN-LOVING, NON-SMOKING
LADY HAS TO SAY.

294
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:31,303
[affected British accent]
HM, OH, YOU WANT
TO COME CLOSER?

295
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,440
UH, GOT A BAD
WHEEL HERE, HAROLD.

296
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,375
HANG ON.

297
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,477
OKAY,
THERE WE GO.

OH, CLOSER? WELL!

299
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,550
CERTAINLY, COME CLOSER.

300
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,518
OH, I DON'T KNOW,
HAROLD.

301
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,787
I'M NOT SURE THE CAMERA
CAN GRAB ALL THOSE TEETH.

302
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:51,824
CLOSER! CLOSER!

303
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,094
HAROLD, WE'RE GETTING A LOT
OF LIGHT OFF THOSE MOLARS.

304
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:57,196
WE'RE PINNING
THE NEEDLE HERE.

305

CALL ME! CALL ME!

Red: NEEDED TO PUT A 
SIGNPOST UP BEHIND THE LODGE.
 

308
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,707
SO WE AGREED TO ALL 
MEET AROUND THERE.
 

309
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,376
A FEW EXTRA 
THINGS IN THE VAN. 

310
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,511
BUT THEN THE SIGNPOST 
WAS IN THERE.
 

311
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,113
DALTON, HE GRABBED 
HE PICKAXE. 

312
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,315
WE NEEDED THAT TO 
KIND OF DIG THE HOLE.
 

313
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,784
AND I GRABBED THE POST, AND 
SHE WAS SNAGGED ON SOMETHING,
 

314
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,552
SO I ASKED DALTON TO 
MAYBE GIVE ME A HAND THERE.
 

315
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,655
LET'S HORSE HER OUTTA THERE. 

316
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,623
SO I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT WAS 
CAUGHT ON AT THAT POINT.
 

317
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,993
THEN I REALISED IT WAS 
ACTUALLY CAUGHT ON WALTER. 

318
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,330
AND WINSTON WAS 
SUPPOSED TO BE --
 

319
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,132
BUT HE HAD FALLEN ASLEEP AT 
THE SWITCH, SO TO SPEAK,
 

320
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,802
SO WINSTON'S JUST GOT A -- 
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF 
WAKING HIM UP. 

321
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:40,172
YOU DON'T GET MUCH SLEEP 
IN THE SEWAGE BUSINESS.
 

322
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,107
SO HE JUST CLIPS THAT ON.  

323
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,677
AND THEN YOU KNOW THE GROUND 
AROUND THE LODGE IS VERY ODD.
 

324
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:46,478
THERE'S HARD SPOTS, 
AND THERE'S SOFT SPOTS,
 

325
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,514
AND THERE'S KIND OF IN 
BETWEEN KIND OF CLAY STUFF.
 

326
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,349
SO YOU KNOW, YOU JUST 
KIND OF TAKE YOUR CHANCES. 

327
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,951
SO WINSTON PICKED A SPOT, 
AND HE GOT INTO IT,
 

328
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,452
BUT HE'D GET IT DOWN 
TO A CERTAIN POINT,
 

329
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,020
BUT HE COULDN'T GET 
IT ALL THE WAY IN,
 

330
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,555
SO WALTER GAVE HIM 
A LITTLE HAND ON THAT. 

331
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,792
SO I'M THINKING, 
YOU KNOW WHAT? 

332
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,560
LET'S JUST TRY 
ANOTHER SPOT.
 

333
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,929
MAYBE THERE'S A 
SOFTER SPOT HERE.
 

334
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:07,232
OKAY, THAT'S A 
LITTLE TOO HARD. 

335
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,501
THEN DALTON FIGURES HE 
WOULD TRY A PICKAXE. 

336
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,136
THE TROUBLE WITH THAT IS YOU 
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S DOWN THERE.
 

337
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,444
AND I'M GUESSING SOME 
KIND OF BURIED CABLE.
 

338
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,279
AND, YEAH. 
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
 

339
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,047
SO THEN WE'VE GOTTA 
GET THAT OUTTA THERE.
 

340
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:24,116
I'M TELLING WINSTON,  

341
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,884
GO BACK AND GET 
THE POSSUM VAN.
 

342
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,653
WE'LL PULL IT 
OUT WITH THAT.
 

343
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,288
SO WINSTON NOTICED 
THE BREAKER HAD TRIPPED, 

344
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,090
SO HE JUST -- 

345
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:35,794
UH, NOT THE BEST IDEA. 

346
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,396
BUT HE DID GET 
THE VAN THERE,
 

347
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,264
AND WE HOOKED THAT UP 
TO THE END OF THE CABLE. 

348
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,699
AND THE IDEA IS WE WERE 
JUST GONNA PULL HER
 

349
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,434
RIGHT OUT OF THE GROUND THAT 
WAY, USING THE POSSUM VAN. 

350
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:45,838
SO, UH, I WENT AND GOT IN THE 
VAN THERE, AND JUST --
 

351
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:48,741
I DON'T LIKE TO 
LOOK BACK IN LIFE. 

352
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:51,310
THAT WAS UNFORTUNATE. 

353
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:54,446
SO THEN I THOUGHT, 
IF I BACK UP AND TAKE
 
A RUN AT IT,

354
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,348
AS I DO WITH MOST 
THINGS IN MY LIFE,
 

355
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,384
I THOUGHT PERHAPS THAT 
WOULD WORK A LITTLE BETTER.
 

356
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,285
BUT WHAT HAPPENED THERE 
WAS ALL I WAS DOING THERE  

357
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,354
WAS ACTUALLY PULLING ON THE 
CABLE INSTEAD OF --
 

358
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,723
AND IT WAS PULLING THE HYDRO 
POLE DOWN INTO THE GROUND  

359
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,760
AND THEN UP THROUGH HOLE THAT 
THE CABLE COME UP THROUGH.
 

360
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:10,062
AND OF COURSE THE GUYS WERE 
NOTICING AND TRYING
 
TO STOP ME

361
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,997
BEFORE WE GOT INTO 
ANY REAL KIND OF TROUBLE.
 

362
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:15,034
NOW, I SAY YOU CAN ALWAYS 
FIND A POSITIVE SIDE
 
TO EVERYTHING.

363
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,869
I'M THINKING, 
WAIT A SECOND.
 

364
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:18,470
WE DON'T NEED 
TO PUT UP A SIGNPOST.
 

365
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,938
WE'VE ALREADY GOT THE POST. 

366
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,407
JUST TAKE THE SIGN 
OFF THAT ONE, 

367
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,908
STICK HER ON THE HYDRO POLE, 

368
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:24,343
AND IT REALLY SERVES 
THE PURPOSE WHICH IS...
 

369
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,512
"CALL BEFORE YOU DIG." 

370
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,852
[quirky upbeat music]

371
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:41,126
WE'VE ALL SEEN THESE
MOTION DETECTOR UNITS

372
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:44,129
THAT TURN THE LIGHTS
ON WHEN YOU COME HOME

373
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:47,466
AFTER DARK SO YOU CAN SEE
WHERE YOUR KID LEFT HIS BIKE.

374
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:50,502
THE PROBLEM IS THEY DO THE
SAME THING FOR BURGLARS.

375
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,337
THEY TURN THE LIGHTS ON

376
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,939
WHEN THEY'RE SNEAKING
AROUND AFTER DARK.

377
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:57,276
SO THEY GET TO SEE WHERE
YOUR KID LEFT HIS BIKE.

378
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,311
THEN OF COURSE,
SOME PEOPLE OVERREACT

379
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:00,979
BY GETTING BEAR
TRAPS OR LAND MINES

380
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,415
OR SOME KIND OF
HOMEMADE NUCLEAR DEVICE.

381
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,417
I GUESS THE SENSIBLE THING
WOULD BE TO GET A GUARD DOG.

382
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,752
BUT THEN YOU GOTTA FEED IT
AND TAKE CARE OF IT

383
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,188
AND MAKE SURE IT
KNOWS WHO YOU ARE.

384
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:10,789
WELL, I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

385
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,558
I GOT ONE OF THESE
HIGH-PITCHED WHISTLES

386
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:15,394
THAT CAN ONLY BE HEARD BY
DOGS AND UNMARRIED LIBRARIANS,

387
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:20,199
AND I ATTACHED IT
TO AN AIR COMPRESSOR.

388
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,601
NOW, INSTEAD OF JUST
THE LIGHT COMING ON, SEE,

389
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,336
EVERY TIME A
BURGLAR GOES BY,

390
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,205
THIS IS GONNA KICK
ON THE COMPRESSOR,

391
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,941
WHICH WILL WAKE UP EVERY DOG
IN THE TRI-COUNTY AREA.

392
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:30,109
HUH? SEE?

393
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:32,111
YOU DON'T NEED MONEY,
AS LONG AS YOU HAVE --

AND I'M DIRTY,

400
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,833
BUT I'M ALWAYS FOR HIRE.

401
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:02,040
WELL, I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH
LUCK FIXING HAROLD'S TAPE

402
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:05,277
FOR THE VIDEO TAPE
DATING SER --

403
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,179
I THINK HE SHOULD
JUST SUBMIT IT LIKE THAT.

404
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,248
IT PRETTY MUCH REPRESENTS
HIS PERSONALITY.

405
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,952
HELLO, UNCLE RED.

406
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:15,487
I HOPE THOSE FLOWERS
AREN'T FOR ME, HAROLD.

FOR MY DATE.

YEAH. YEAH.

00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:25,097
SO YOU JUST GIVE A
SHORT BIO OF YOURSELF,

412
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,399
AND THEN THEY MATCH YOU UP
WITH SOMEONE WITH SIMILAR
INTERESTS.

413
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:28,834
I THINK IT'S
WAY BETTER.

FLATTER ME.

THAT'S THE WAY.

457
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:31,256
ALL RISE!

458
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,295
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI. 

459
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,397
Red: SIT DOWN.

460
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,967
ALL RIGHT, MEN, BOW YOUR
HEADS FOR THE MAN'S PRAYER.

461
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:45,671
I'M A MAN, BUT I CAN CHANGE,

462
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:48,240
IF I HAVE TO,
I GUESS.

463
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,250
THAT WAS KIND OF
A SHORT DATE.

464
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:01,987
YEAH, WINSTON HAD TO LEAVE
FOR AN EMERGENCY CALL.

465
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:05,590
SO HE LEFT YOU FOR
A YOUNGER LOAD.

466
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:11,096
