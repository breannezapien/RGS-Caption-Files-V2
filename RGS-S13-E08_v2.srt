1
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:05,538
You know it once in a while, it's nice to dip
back into the past to find something useful

2
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:10,710
for the present. Like, for example, this
mood ring, remember these from the sixties?

3
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:13,980
No. Do you remember anything from the 60s?

4
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:19,352
Yeah, some kind of weird chemical on here
that makes it change color with the mood of

5
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:23,623
the person who's wearing it came in real
handy when you're on a date kind of gave you

6
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:25,358
a signal of wanting to make your move.

7
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:29,562
But after you get married, you need more of
a distant early warning system.

8
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:35,068
I taped a bunch of these mood rings to the
door knob on the front of my house and the

9
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:39,005
door knob and brass, so it actually conducts
the mood from inside the house.

10
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:44,277
That way, when I get home, I can get a sense
of what kind of mood my wife's in without

11
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:45,745
even having to step through the door.

12
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:54,187
The caller tells me whether I need to get
maybe flowers, chocolates or a place to stay.

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,944
Got this invitation from the government for
the town of Possum Lake, they're going to

14
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,813
have a spelling contest with a thousand
first prize.

15
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:22,982
It's part of a big plan to smarten us all
up.

16
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:26,819
Apparently, they had some survey and the
average Canadian is stupider than ever.

17
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:29,889
I think of all these politicians better be
careful.

18
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:31,991
If we get too smart, none of them will get
elected.

19
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:39,132
Good morning, G.O.O.D, and thank you.

20
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:43,870
I'm sorry, Harold, that's incorrect.

21
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,071
It's quarter after three.

22
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,940
It's a spelling exercise.

23
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:50,710
I want to be spelling rep for the town, you
know, over the big spelling bee.

24
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,412
Yes, I'm using a dictionary to practice,
right?

25
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,848
Well, you have to earn that job here.

26
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:56,949
Let's see the rules here.

27
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:59,952
You've got to have an open competition with
at least three people in it and then the

28
00:01:59,952 --> 00:02:01,521
winner of that represents the town.

29
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:04,157
Yeah, that's OK. I'm fine with that because I
am a very good speller.

30
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:05,591
All right. Are you a good speller?

31
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:09,262
I don't really know. You know, my handwriting
is so bad I never been able to tell.

32
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,066
Well, I'm a very good speller.

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,335
You can pick any word on this dictionary and
I can spell it.

34
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:20,239
Go ahead, pick any word, pick a word, pick a
word, pick a word, pick a word, pick a word.

35
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,307
All right, I'll pick a word. Ok.

36
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,445
Obnoxious. Alfie A.

37
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,948
No. H a r OLB.

38
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,718
Hey, there's a picture of you.

39
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:42,995
It's time for the Possum Lodge word game.

40
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:56,175
Today's price is a coupon for a free session
at the House of Hammers and Phrenology.

41
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,379
Where we give you a bump on the head, then
read it.

42
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:03,216
Ok, here I'm coming to your ears.

43
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,485
Ok, read you got 30 seconds to get Harold to
say this word.

44
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:09,388
Car car.

45
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:11,624
All right, Mr. And go.

46
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,294
All right. Harold, this is something that
you've got to have if you want to go parking

47
00:03:15,294 --> 00:03:17,163
on lover's lane. A girl.

48
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:23,102
Ok, no, no. But this is something that you
need to attract girls.

49
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:26,772
Wow. Fluency in Klingon.

50
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:30,409
No, no, no.

51
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:35,481
Ok. This is something you don't ever want to
have an accident in a rented tax.

52
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:43,122
Most of us at the

53
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:44,457
Lodge have these, OK?

54
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,661
Winston says a Hemi daltons as a hatchback,
mine's about 15 years old.

55
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:57,403
Bad haircuts. Almost out of time, ran, you
know, I know, I know, I know.

56
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:02,408
Ok, Harold. This is something that will take
you anywhere you want to go at any speed, day

57
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,009
or night at any one high

58
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:05,177
Speed wireless connection.

59
00:04:06,912 --> 00:04:09,415
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, it's great for
shopping on the internet.

60
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:10,850
That's where I bought my cargo pants.

61
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:20,759
There we go. That's the repair

62
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:23,929
shop, part of the show we call, if it ain't
broke, you're not trying.

63
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,501
Joining me today is local water taxi
operator Hypersonics.

64
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:29,702
You've got a pair of boxing gloves there,
huh?

65
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:34,707
Yeah, I'm in training thinking about going
back in the ring again.

66
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:37,309
Yeah, but my old gloves are coming apart at
the seams.

67
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:39,378
Well, they're in good company.

68
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,182
I didn't know you were a boxer, huh?

69
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:45,885
Oh, I didn't fight under the name HAP.

70
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:48,220
Back then I was kid unbelievable.

71
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:55,928
Nineteen sixty four, I was making ends meet
by working as a limo driver in New York City.

72
00:04:56,595 --> 00:05:02,201
It was my job to drive a young Sonny Liston
to his fateful bout with Cassius Clay at

73
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,235
Madison Square Garden.

74
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,437
My grandfather built that place with his
bare hands.

75
00:05:07,673 --> 00:05:09,275
One at a time now. Come on.

76
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:16,015
Anyway, Liston and I got into a squabble
about the validity of my quantum physics

77
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:21,153
theorem and the next thing I know the cars
pulled over and Liston and I are throwing

78
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:24,623
punches at each other in an alley hall 40
Seventh Street.

79
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:26,892
I led with the right.

80
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:29,094
He crossed with the left and suddenly bam.

81
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:30,629
Tremendous blow to the head.

82
00:05:31,463 --> 00:05:32,965
Well, you know, that explains so much.

83
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:41,240
Main Liston went down like a sack of hammers
right there at that moment, I was the champ

84
00:05:41,273 --> 00:05:42,574
and I got nothing for it.

85
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:47,246
Anyway, I folded Sonny up, threw him in the
limo, took him to the fight, and the rest is

86
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:47,780
history.

87
00:05:49,214 --> 00:05:51,417
Yeah, well, your boxing gloves are all done
there.

88
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,285
I think you'll find they're as good as new.

89
00:05:53,285 --> 00:05:53,619
Yeah.

90
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:54,953
Great. Great. Great. Thanks, Ray.

91
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:59,024
All right. No problem. I sure hope the
Boxing Commission grants me my license.

92
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:00,926
Yeah, that's a part of my life.

93
00:06:00,926 --> 00:06:02,094
I want to get back.

94
00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:04,530
I feel the same way about this conversation.

95
00:06:11,703 --> 00:06:14,573
A lot of people have these ceiling fans in
their houses.

96
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,677
They're supposed to help with the air
movement so that instead of your house having

97
00:06:18,677 --> 00:06:21,146
a couple of cold spots, it's cold all over.

98
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,851
I don't really like the ceiling fans all
that much at the low speed.

99
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:29,454
They cool off your soup and at the high
speed they blow your toupee right into it.

100
00:06:30,622 --> 00:06:31,890
Mind you, they are handy for slice and
fruit.

101
00:06:37,462 --> 00:06:41,900
And I believe I have a better use for
ceiling fans instead of using energy.

102
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,469
My idea has these ceiling fans saving
energy.

103
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,406
Now some of you may already be ahead of me
on this.

104
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,508
That just means you probably shouldn't be
watching my show.

105
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:53,979
I believe Lawrence Welk is on what I'm going
to do is mount these ceiling fans on to this

106
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:55,480
car one on each corner.

107
00:06:55,814 --> 00:06:58,917
And then as they spin around, that's going
to give me lift.

108
00:06:59,184 --> 00:07:01,453
Lift is very important, as any woman will
tell you.

109
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,758
But in this case, see, the lift is actually
going to reduce the weight of this pig by

110
00:07:06,758 --> 00:07:10,228
about a thousand pounds, going to give it
the same gas mileage as those little puddle

111
00:07:10,228 --> 00:07:12,364
jumpers they sell to old ladies and college
professors.

112
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:17,736
Now we just need some way to spin the
ceiling, fans can't just plug them in and

113
00:07:17,736 --> 00:07:21,039
drive away. I mean, even if you did have a
long enough extension cord, you'd have to

114
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,476
worry about pedestrians and lift bridges,
and you always have to come back the same way

115
00:07:24,476 --> 00:07:27,212
you went. Someone said, We're going to take
the wheels off.

116
00:07:27,212 --> 00:07:29,815
This baby carriage shouldn't be too tough.

117
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:33,652
If you have my kind of medical history, the
wheels fell off your baby carriage years ago.

118
00:07:35,554 --> 00:07:37,022
Oh oh, oh, oh

119
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:46,031
Oh, it's a doll. Now, here's where the real
genius comes in.

120
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:52,771
No, I'm wrong. Ok, I'm going to use the car
itself to power these fancy.

121
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:56,341
I got them out of the ceiling fan over each
of the wheel wells and then when the carriage

122
00:07:56,341 --> 00:08:01,246
wheel rubs up against the tire, that'll make
the fan spin even on the front wheel.

123
00:08:01,413 --> 00:08:04,850
And even though it turns like that, it's
still the center of the top stays in the same

124
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,018
place. Hey, how brilliant is that?

125
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:10,188
You know, no wonder my parents questioned
why I found great.

126
00:08:10,188 --> 00:08:12,924
Seven So hard every year.

127
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,296
The only other tricky part is you've got to
take a look at the angle of the fan blades,

128
00:08:18,296 --> 00:08:21,199
make sure you mount them on the right side
of the car because one side is going to go

129
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,401
one way and the other side is going to go
the other way.

130
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:27,105
And if you do it wrong, the fans will push
down instead of lift and that's going to kill

131
00:08:27,105 --> 00:08:30,942
your gas mileage. It'll be like driving
around with Moose Thompson on your roof rack.

132
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:46,758
I think we're good to go here, and this is
way better than the EPA solutions to gas

133
00:08:46,758 --> 00:08:48,460
mileage, they just want you to go slow.

134
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,428
They got the walking's far.

135
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:56,001
But my system, the faster you go, the faster
the fans go, the lighter the car gets, the

136
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:57,369
better gas mileage you get.

137
00:08:57,969 --> 00:08:59,137
I don't see a downside.

138
00:08:59,137 --> 00:09:03,074
You let's take it for a spin pack.

139
00:09:03,074 --> 00:09:04,442
Let's take her for four spins.

140
00:09:08,813 --> 00:09:12,017
So remember, if the women don't find you
handsome, they should at least find your

141
00:09:12,017 --> 00:09:16,588
handy. Oh, here's another bonus hitchhikers
won't come near you.

142
00:09:39,844 --> 00:09:44,449
I think I have a sensible explanation as to
why men do so many crazy things.

143
00:09:45,016 --> 00:09:49,654
Now I don't care what species you look at,
the male is forced to attract the females

144
00:09:49,654 --> 00:09:54,192
attention. Peacock spread their tails, Ram's
butt heads.

145
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:56,127
Men drive monster trucks.

146
00:09:57,796 --> 00:10:02,867
Now, I know when you see a guy peel away
from a stoplight or a crushed beer cans with

147
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:03,868
his forehead.

148
00:10:04,702 --> 00:10:06,838
Most women just roll their eyes.

149
00:10:07,238 --> 00:10:12,644
But the truth is men are programmed to
choose behavior that doesn't interfere with

150
00:10:12,644 --> 00:10:14,112
mating. You know what that means?

151
00:10:14,145 --> 00:10:18,650
That means that somewhere there are other
women who are actually impressed with male

152
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:24,289
stupidity. We call these women girlfriends.

153
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:31,229
Then later, when they come to their senses
and see the idiotic behavior for what it

154
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:33,932
really is, we call them wives.

155
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:40,071
So whenever you see a guy belching the
national anthem while he accompanies himself

156
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:42,774
with an armpit? Wish him luck.

157
00:10:43,474 --> 00:10:45,476
He's either not married or about to be that
way.

158
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:48,413
Remember, I'm pulling for you.

159
00:10:48,713 --> 00:10:49,881
We're all in this together.

160
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,753
On my way, Rothschild sewage.

161
00:10:55,787 --> 00:10:59,390
When you can't take it anymore, we'll come
over and take it for you.

162
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:06,230
Now, we're not quite ready to fill the entry
form yet, but we thought we'd have a little

163
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:11,269
trial run between Dalton and Harold there,
so might want to check the spelling on the.

164
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:19,711
All right. Harold, are you ready for your
first word there?

165
00:11:19,944 --> 00:11:25,149
Ok, let's see indices,

166
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:29,387
Indices, AI and the AI.

167
00:11:30,788 --> 00:11:32,757
I see it

168
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,027
S wasn't really asking you, Mike.

169
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:39,197
What's your guess,

170
00:11:40,098 --> 00:11:40,898
What he said?

171
00:11:45,169 --> 00:11:50,208
Ok, Dalton, quadrennial quadrennial,

172
00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:52,577
What does that mean,

173
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:56,080
Something that only happens every four years?

174
00:11:56,714 --> 00:11:58,850
Oh, like Anne-Marie, getting romantic?

175
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:03,321
No, no, it's more like the Olympics.

176
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:06,123
You don't know it, Marie.

177
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:08,693
All right, just take your guess, William
Dalton.

178
00:12:09,193 --> 00:12:09,961
Ok, OK,

179
00:12:10,695 --> 00:12:17,101
Hugh, you? D, D, e and An.

180
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:22,840
A hell look to your mind.

181
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:25,876
Oh, oh, oh, sorry, Don.

182
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:28,012
I don't know what came over me.

183
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:30,147
Well, it's the chainsaw, the sound of the
chainsaw.

184
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:33,551
Every time he hears it, he goes into that
trance to start spelling.

185
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:35,219
But why would that be here?

186
00:12:35,486 --> 00:12:41,292
Oh, I know it was a cell mate I had in jail
who used to punch me every time I spelled my

187
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:44,962
graffiti. Wrong chainsaw working.

188
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:49,300
So you learn to show a little r-e-s-p-e-c-t,
huh?

189
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:56,273
I found out what it means to me, you've got
to be stuck it to me, sock it to me, sucking.

190
00:13:03,681 --> 00:13:07,451
We're putting a little campfire tent thing
together behind the lines, Walter was

191
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:09,954
bringing the cooler and Bill and I were
putting on a photo.

192
00:13:11,856 --> 00:13:12,923
I guess it wasn't much. Ok.

193
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:15,626
Ok. You know. Well, you've got to be
responsible for yourself.

194
00:13:15,726 --> 00:13:16,827
You've got to watch. No, no, no.

195
00:13:16,827 --> 00:13:19,196
No, no, no. No need for temper now.

196
00:13:19,196 --> 00:13:23,033
You're not hurt. You're fine. So Bill and I
tried to get the tent together and Walter's

197
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:24,068
trying to clean things up.

198
00:13:24,468 --> 00:13:28,005
Ok. Ok, now that probably hurt.

199
00:13:28,072 --> 00:13:31,308
Ok, that's probably. But again, you're going
to want you always when you're camping, this

200
00:13:31,308 --> 00:13:32,343
is for your youngsters out there.

201
00:13:32,343 --> 00:13:38,449
You got to watch what the other guy is
doing, you know, like, don't do this, and we

202
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:40,151
didn't know what was pulling on me again.

203
00:13:41,852 --> 00:13:43,687
Mean that that way lies madness.

204
00:13:44,788 --> 00:13:48,325
So we got the tent up and Bill's going to
get the campfire going and we're going to

205
00:13:48,325 --> 00:13:51,729
just split the log. So he's got you just
just going to just hit it.

206
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:58,302
Walter, Walter, Walter, Walter Lowery hit
the log.

207
00:13:58,302 --> 00:14:02,573
And you know, this happens sometimes you get
a green log or what have you, or maybe the ax

208
00:14:02,573 --> 00:14:05,276
isn't wide enough at the one end that the
bill is going to get the.

209
00:14:05,576 --> 00:14:08,812
Not too many. Oh, no, not don't, you know,
don't use all the matches bill.

210
00:14:08,812 --> 00:14:10,314
Not. Yeah.

211
00:14:11,615 --> 00:14:17,721
All right. So meanwhile, a second axe into
the roughly into the same split, we'll just

212
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:18,722
open that baby right up.

213
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,724
Just hit it. Walter. Hit it, hit it.

214
00:14:20,724 --> 00:14:22,559
Walter hit it now. Walter hit it now.

215
00:14:25,796 --> 00:14:28,666
Ok, I was wrong. Ok, OK.

216
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:30,467
No. Hmm.

217
00:14:31,969 --> 00:14:35,005
Yeah, well, let's try by this point, we
tried a few axes.

218
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,910
And that unbelievable that a lie would take
that.

219
00:14:40,377 --> 00:14:42,379
I spend lots of nuts in that.

220
00:14:42,713 --> 00:14:44,581
I got an idea, though. Let's flip it over.

221
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:49,887
Just flip it over. Meanwhile, Bill is going
back to the old style of lighting a fire with

222
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,424
a string and the I don't even know what they
call this, but it's nothing good.

223
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,259
And then. All right.

224
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:59,196
I should know. It's unbelievable, isn't it?

225
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,599
Boy, oh boy. We're going to run out of
access here.

226
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:05,369
This is we got the double ender.

227
00:15:05,402 --> 00:15:06,804
I used to call it when we were younger.

228
00:15:06,804 --> 00:15:08,005
And oh.

229
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:10,841
Hmm. Ok.

230
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:15,245
Ok. Ok. Ok, so now, Bill, starting to get
some small kids getting some heat going,

231
00:15:15,245 --> 00:15:17,114
they're gonna take her up a notch there,
bill and.

232
00:15:19,216 --> 00:15:25,756
Actually running out of space is to put an
axe into the log, so yeah, I got another

233
00:15:25,756 --> 00:15:27,958
idea. I think that that's.

234
00:15:28,992 --> 00:15:30,327
On fire, it's on fire.

235
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,463
Get it down. Ok, now, just move the camp,
yeah.

236
00:15:32,696 --> 00:15:34,398
Move the Camp Fire over to where the fire is
there.

237
00:15:34,531 --> 00:15:35,933
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

238
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,367
If not, don't blow too hard.

239
00:15:37,401 --> 00:15:39,403
Easy. Easy. Oh boy, oh boy.

240
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:44,608
Oh boy. So I think if he uses the hatchet
just in the right spot, we still got room for

241
00:15:44,608 --> 00:15:49,680
that. Now, Walter's not good at taking
direction, and he just misinterpreted my

242
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,852
instructions. No. Like, how is that helping,
I don't I don't understand that.

243
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,889
Meanwhile, bills, he's got enough of it
stamped out.

244
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:02,059
He's all set. He's ready to bring the two
bring the log over.

245
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:04,695
But OK, well, you know what?

246
00:16:04,728 --> 00:16:07,764
I got an idea, OK?

247
00:16:07,831 --> 00:16:09,299
And we're all. Don't watch Bill.

248
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:11,835
Eat it. Don't watch. Not not if you're
eating it all yourself.

249
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:14,137
You can't use the log to burn or use it as a
holder.

250
00:16:28,218 --> 00:16:33,991
No men have always had hobbies like fishing
or building things or just winging acorns and

251
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:39,997
squirrels. Unfortunately, men have also had
chores like cleaning out the eavesdrops.

252
00:16:40,397 --> 00:16:42,499
The difference is hobbies are fun.

253
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,701
Chores are work now.

254
00:16:44,701 --> 00:16:46,970
On the surface, it may be kind of hard to
tell them apart.

255
00:16:47,337 --> 00:16:51,041
What's the difference, you might say between
collecting screws in a jar and picking up

256
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,442
your laundry and put it in the hamper?

257
00:16:53,043 --> 00:16:56,613
Or what's the difference between the policy
in your car and polishing your silverware?

258
00:16:57,314 --> 00:17:00,250
Simple one is a job, the other one is a
hobby.

259
00:17:01,551 --> 00:17:05,222
The trick is to be able to combine the two,
and I'm a tricky guy.

260
00:17:07,257 --> 00:17:08,425
Here we have a hobby.

261
00:17:08,658 --> 00:17:14,197
This model train and a job to do, clean out
those these troughs, you have attached a

262
00:17:14,197 --> 00:17:16,700
snowplow onto the front of the train.

263
00:17:18,101 --> 00:17:20,904
And gets to do all the work I get to have
all the fun.

264
00:17:21,338 --> 00:17:22,305
You get to watch.

265
00:17:49,699 --> 00:17:52,669
Well, we're almost ready to fill out our
entry form.

266
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:57,407
We got Mike and Dalton from the Lodge and
then the town is sending up some lame entrant

267
00:17:57,407 --> 00:18:02,178
Sam, something or other so that we'll have
three and that'll make it legal and we're

268
00:18:02,178 --> 00:18:03,380
going to help Mike out a little bit.

269
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,548
We got Harold outside with a chainsaw.

270
00:18:05,548 --> 00:18:07,384
He's going to rev it up, you know, just at
the right moment.

271
00:18:08,451 --> 00:18:09,619
All good to go there, Harold.

272
00:18:13,657 --> 00:18:16,359
That OK, let's get started.

273
00:18:16,393 --> 00:18:19,829
I'm ready to SPL and my alphabets for
breakfast.

274
00:18:20,497 --> 00:18:24,401
Now we just just got to wait for the token
entrant from the town there, you know?

275
00:18:24,434 --> 00:18:26,069
Sam Sumner, You know what?

276
00:18:26,069 --> 00:18:27,103
That's probably him right now.

277
00:18:28,972 --> 00:18:33,209
I. Hello, there.

278
00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:36,112
We'd like four boxes of cookies if you'll
take a check.

279
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,081
Far for

280
00:18:39,282 --> 00:18:40,683
A spelling contest,

281
00:18:41,951 --> 00:18:46,723
This is Sam. Well, you know, we have some
pretty big words in this thing.

282
00:18:47,157 --> 00:18:49,459
That's OK. I'll help you print out some.

283
00:18:52,562 --> 00:18:54,664
All right, well, all right, I guess we're
ready to go.

284
00:18:54,697 --> 00:18:55,899
Are we all are we ready to go?

285
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:57,834
Yeah. All right. Great. Ok.

286
00:18:58,668 --> 00:19:01,070
All right, well, ladies, first and.

287
00:19:03,306 --> 00:19:07,811
Rhythm h y t, h m.

288
00:19:09,212 --> 00:19:10,246
Yeah, right,

289
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:19,088
Yeah, right. Ok, Dalton, your word is
tchotchke.

290
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:23,193
I give up.

291
00:19:25,762 --> 00:19:27,130
Well, that's a little embarrassing, isn't it?

292
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,065
Not nearly as embarrassing as it would have
been.

293
00:19:31,634 --> 00:19:35,538
All right, Mike, Tchotchke charge cap.

294
00:19:38,474 --> 00:19:44,180
T C, h, o t, c, h k e.

295
00:19:52,255 --> 00:19:53,790
Mike, you go first this time.

296
00:19:53,823 --> 00:19:55,925
Oh, you're where it is.

297
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:57,026
Pick a Lily.

298
00:19:59,362 --> 00:20:02,465
Well, we didn't use the word peculiarly in
prison.

299
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,004
Oh, man. Time's up peculiarly.

300
00:20:08,571 --> 00:20:13,109
P i cc a l i l l i.

301
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,685
I went got to go.

302
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,158
Oh, that's little time, and

303
00:20:30,026 --> 00:20:31,327
Oh, no, no, no, no.

304
00:20:31,694 --> 00:20:33,463
We. I'll be down in the minute.

305
00:20:35,431 --> 00:20:36,499
My wife is watching.

306
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,167
I'll be coming straight home after the
meeting.

307
00:20:39,235 --> 00:20:42,105
Real tense day and I'm hoping for a little
relief and I don't smell it.

308
00:20:42,105 --> 00:20:45,141
Our old lady and the president.

309
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,811
Thanks for watching on behalf of myself and
Harold and the whole gang up here for some

310
00:20:48,811 --> 00:20:50,546
lunch. Keep your stick on the ice.

311
00:20:57,787 --> 00:20:59,589
Down down.

312
00:21:00,456 --> 00:21:05,428
All right. Know.

313
00:21:06,963 --> 00:21:11,400
More now, Eric Bamberger heads for the man's
PR.

314
00:21:12,568 --> 00:21:16,873
I'm a man, but I can change if I have to.

315
00:21:17,607 --> 00:21:22,945
Yes. Okay, man, we're out of the running for
the spelling bee in the thousand dollar

316
00:21:22,945 --> 00:21:27,617
prize. I was looking in the large cash box
and I was just wondering how many of you know

317
00:21:27,617 --> 00:21:31,287
how to spell IOU, OK?

318
00:21:31,454 --> 00:21:33,489
And how many of you know what it means?

319
00:21:35,558 --> 00:21:41,097
That's what I thought. But.
