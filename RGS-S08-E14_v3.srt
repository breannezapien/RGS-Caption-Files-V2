174
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:33,639
TRY IT, THE RAT BITES ME.

175
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:37,142
OW!

176
00:04:37,142 --> 00:04:40,112
[laughter and applause]

177
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,315
COME ON, HAP.

178
00:04:43,315 --> 00:04:44,250
HE'S STILL IN THERE.

179
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,319
THAT'S THE MAIN PROBLEM.

180
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:50,890
JEEZ, HE'S REALLY HANGING ON

181
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,025
THERE.

182
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:54,159
YOU MAY HAVE TO DO WITHOUT

183
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,561
CHRISTMAS LIGHTS, HAP.

184
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:56,729
NO, NO, CAN'T DO THAT.

185
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:57,897
GOT TO HANG THE LIGHTS.

186
00:04:57,897 --> 00:04:58,964
I INVENTED THEM.

187
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:01,934
[laughter]

188
00:05:02,901 --> 00:05:03,702
YOU INVENTED CHRISTMAS

189
00:05:03,702 --> 00:05:04,737
LIGHTS?

190
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,538
YEAH.

191
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:10,309
I ONLY TRIED TO SAVE MY PLATOON.

192
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:11,510
ON CHRISTMAS DAY, WE WERE

193
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,312
SURROUNDED, OUT OF AMMO, AND OUR

194
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:15,648
SERGEANT, SERGEANT...

195
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,116
PEPPER...

196
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:20,986
[laughter]

197
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:22,087
HE WANTED TO SURRENDER, BUT

198
00:05:22,087 --> 00:05:23,188
WE WERE HOLED UP IN A LIGHT BULB

199
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:23,989
FACTORY.

200
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:25,224
SO I GOT THIS IDEA STRINGING A

201
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:26,959
WHOLE LOT OF BULBS TOGETHER, YOU

202
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,460
SEE, AND THEN PLUGGING THEM IN

203
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,294
AND OUT REAL QUICK.

204
00:05:29,294 --> 00:05:30,763
FLASH, FLASH, FLASH.

205
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,031
AND, FROM A DISTANCE, IT

206
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,098
LOOKED AS THOUGH THAT WAS THE

207
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:34,500
FLASH OF RIFLES FIRING.

208
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,467
WELL, I KEPT FLASHING THE

209
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:36,035
LIGHTS.

210
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,770
THE GERMANS STAYED AWAY.

211
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,004
AND THE VERY NEXT DAY, GENERAL

212
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:40,406
MONTGOMERY DECIDED TO GIVE ME

213
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:41,473
THE CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF

214
00:05:41,473 --> 00:05:43,909
HONOR.

215
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:45,210
NOW, NOW, THAT'S INCREDIBLE,

216
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,278
HAP.

217
00:05:46,278 --> 00:05:47,746
A CANADIAN SOLDIER GETTING AN

218
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:48,781
AMERICAN MEDAL FROM A BRITISH

219
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:51,016
GENERAL.

220
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:59,525
CHRISTMAS IS WHITE SNOW ON THE

221
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,692
TREES.

222
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:02,394
AND PEOPLE DECORATE THEIR STUFF

223
00:06:02,394 --> 00:06:03,562
WITH CHRISTMAS THINGS.

224
00:06:03,562 --> 00:06:05,664
AND YOUR BREATH IS...

225
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:06,498
WELL, YOU CAN SEE IT, YOU

226
00:06:06,498 --> 00:06:07,599
KNOW, SO IT'S COLD, YOU KNOW

227
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:09,134
WHAT I--YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

228
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:10,302
LOOK, OKAY, I GUESS THIS ISN'T

229
00:06:10,302 --> 00:06:11,436
VERY POETIC.

230
00:06:11,436 --> 00:06:12,638
BUT SOMETIMES IT'S--YOU KNOW,

231
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:13,772
IT'S GOOD JUST TO GIVE OUT FACTS

232
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:14,907
ABOUT CHRISTMAS WITHOUT

233
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:15,841
EMBELLISHMENT.

234
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:17,342
JUST EVEN--EVEN POINT FORM

235
00:06:17,342 --> 00:06:18,443
THINGS THAT ARE RELATED TO

236
00:06:18,443 --> 00:06:19,978
CHRISTMAS, LIKE TREES AND

237
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:21,647
PRESENTS AND SNOWMEN.

238
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:22,681
OLDER PEOPLE NEED THIS

239
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:24,016
STRAIGHTFORWARD KIND OF APPROACH

240
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:25,117
SO THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING

241
00:06:25,117 --> 00:06:26,451
ON AROUND THEM.

242
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:27,619
IT'S ALSO GOOD FOR PEOPLE WHO

243
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:29,254
AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH CHRISTMAS,

244
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:30,489
LIKE THE AUSTRALIANS.

245
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:31,857
THEY JUST--THEY JUST WANT TO

246
00:06:31,857 --> 00:06:32,524
KNOW THE FACTS.

247
00:06:32,524 --> 00:06:33,492
IF YOU WANT THE FACTS, COME TO

248
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:34,326
ME.

249
00:06:34,326 --> 00:06:35,494
IF YOU WANT POETRY, READ A

250
00:06:35,494 --> 00:06:37,663
BUMPER STICKER.

251
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,265
YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE ABOUT

252
00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:41,466
CHRISTMASTIME, EVEN MORE THAN

253
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:44,069
FRUITCAKE?

254
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:47,039
[laughter]

255
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:50,142
NOTHING.

256
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:50,776
I HATE FRUITCAKE.

257
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:52,377
I CAN'T...

258
00:06:52,377 --> 00:06:53,412
GETS STUCK IN YOUR TEETH, YOU

259
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:53,912
KNOW.

260
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:54,746
LIKE, DOING THAT.

261
00:06:54,746 --> 00:06:56,081
IT'S, LIKE, GROUNDHOG DAY OR

262
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:56,982
SOMETHING.

263
00:06:56,982 --> 00:06:58,150
BUT A CLOSE SECOND, A CLOSE

264
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,251
SECOND WOULD BE, LIKE, WAITING

265
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:00,085
FOR CHRISTMAS DAY TO COME,

266
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:00,619
RIGHT?

267
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:01,753
'CAUSE I LOVE CHRISTMAS, AND IT

268
00:07:01,753 --> 00:07:03,855
TAKES SO LONG!

269
00:07:03,855 --> 00:07:05,290
LIKE, FOR INSTANCE, I WISH,

270
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,692
LIKE, TODAY WAS TOMORROW

271
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:07,559
BECAUSE THEN I'D BE, LIKE, ONE

272
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:08,327
DAY CLOSER TO CHRISTMAS.

273
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:09,328
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT GONNA

274
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,128
HAPPEN 'CAUSE I GOT TO WAIT

275
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:10,896
FOR TODAY TO END, AND THAT'S

276
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:11,763
GONNA BE TOMORROW SOMETIME, SO

277
00:07:11,763 --> 00:07:15,600
I'VE MISSED IT.

278
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,601
SO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO IS

279
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:17,969
EFFECTIVELY COME UP WITH WAYS

280
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:18,737
TO KILL TIME PRIOR TO

281
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:19,805
CHRISTMAS ACTUALLY ARRIVING.

282
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:22,341
WAH, WAH, WAH.

283
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,475
SO EACH YEAR, WHAT I DO IS, I

284
00:07:23,475 --> 00:07:28,480
CREATE A RED AND GREEN...

285
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,315
RED AND GREEN, I SAID!

286
00:07:30,315 --> 00:07:31,550
I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE THAT

287
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,186
BEFORE.

288
00:07:34,186 --> 00:07:35,387
THAT'S SO COOL.

289
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:37,723
I'M--WHAT I DO IS, I MAKE THIS--

290
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:39,024
A RED AND GREEN PAPER CHAIN

291
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:40,225
REINDEER DAYS-LEFT

292
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:41,259
WALL-MOUNTED CALENDAR.

293
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:44,696
AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS, EVERY

294
00:07:44,696 --> 00:07:45,931
DAY THAT GETS CLOSER TO

295
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:47,332
CHRISTMAS, YOU JUST, YOU KNOW,

296
00:07:47,332 --> 00:07:49,301
TEAR OFF A LINK.

297
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:50,669
LA-LA, LIKE THAT, YOU SEE?

298
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:51,636
AND NOW YOU--YOU'VE EFFECTIVELY

299
00:07:51,636 --> 00:07:52,771
KILLED, LIKE, TWO SECONDS,

300
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:54,139
RIGHT?

301
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:55,006
GOSH, TWO SECONDS, WHERE DID IT

302
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:55,507
GO?

303
00:07:55,507 --> 00:07:56,007
I DON'T KNOW.

304
00:07:56,007 --> 00:07:56,508
IT'S GONE.

305
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:58,043
SO NOW ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS,

306
00:07:58,043 --> 00:07:59,277
WAIT, LIKE, 23 HOURS, 59

307
00:07:59,277 --> 00:08:00,412
MINUTES, AND 58 SECONDS BEFORE

308
00:08:00,412 --> 00:08:01,246
I CAN TEAR OFF ANOTHER ONE,

309
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:02,347
KILL SOME MORE TIME.

310
00:08:02,347 --> 00:08:04,649
JUST TEAR RIGHT OFF, LIKE THAT.

311
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:07,752
[laughter]

312
00:08:07,752 --> 00:08:11,590
I--I TORE OFF TOMORROW.

313
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,791
I'M GONNA HAVE NOTHING TO DO

314
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:17,229
TOMORROW!

315
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:18,263
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU KNOW WHAT,

316
00:08:18,263 --> 00:08:19,231
I COULD EFFECTIVELY KILL TIME

317
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:20,899
BY PUTTING IT ALL BACK TOGETHER.

318
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:22,133
YOU SEE, THAT'S WHAT I--THAT'S

319
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:23,134
HOW I'LL EFFECTIVELY KILL TIME

320
00:08:23,134 --> 00:08:23,869
FOR THE NEXT LITTLE WHILE.

321
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:24,603
AND YOU KNOW WHAT'S REALLY

322
00:08:24,603 --> 00:08:26,137
INTERESTING ABOUT ALL THIS, IS,

323
00:08:26,137 --> 00:08:26,972
NONE OF THIS WOULD EVEN MATTER

324
00:08:26,972 --> 00:08:28,506
IF I HAD A GIRLFRIEND.

325
00:08:28,506 --> 00:08:31,476
[laughter and applause]

326
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:38,984
MY MA'S IN THE KITCHEN

327
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:40,652

328

GRANDMA AND HER BOYFRIEND

THIS IS THAT PART OF THE SHOW

344
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:14,719
WHERE WE LIKE TO EXAMINE THOSE

345
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:16,087
THREE LITTLE WORDS THAT MEN

346
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:17,689
FIND SO HARD TO SAY--

347
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:18,690
[audience together]

348
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,924
"I DON'T KNOW."

349
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:21,059
YEAH, IT'S--THERE THE ONES,

350
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:21,826
EXACTLY.

351
00:09:21,826 --> 00:09:23,161
OKAY, JOINING ME AND UNCLE RED

352
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:24,029
IN EXPERT PORTION OF THE SHOW

353
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:26,131

354
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,731

355
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:28,166
MR. MIKE HAMAR, AND MR. DALTON

356
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,134
HUMPHREY.

357
00:09:29,134 --> 00:09:31,736
[cheers and applause]

358
00:09:33,838 --> 00:09:34,873
WOW, THAT'S GREAT--THREE WHOLE

359
00:09:34,873 --> 00:09:36,408
EXPERTS.

360
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:37,709
NOT QUITE THE THREE WISE MEN,

361
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:39,411
BUT...

362
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:40,245
WELL, AT LEAST WE STILL GOT

363
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:41,746
THE EXPECTANT VIRGIN.

364
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:44,716
[cheers and applause]

365
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,255
TODAY'S LETTER GOES AS

366
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:53,124
FOLLOWS.

367
00:09:53,124 --> 00:09:54,459
"I AM EIGHT YEARS OLD, AND A

368
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:55,493
LOT OF MY FRIENDS HAVE

369
00:09:55,493 --> 00:09:56,861
RECENTLY TOLD ME THERE IS SUCH

370
00:09:56,861 --> 00:09:59,063
THING AS A SANTA CLAUS.

371
00:09:59,063 --> 00:10:00,465
PLEASE TELL ME THE TRUTH.

372
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:03,268
IS THERE A SANTA CLAUS?"

373
00:10:03,268 --> 00:10:04,569
IS THERE A SANTA CLAUS?

374
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:05,737
I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF QUESTION

375
00:10:05,737 --> 00:10:06,905
IS THAT?

376
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:07,872
I MEAN, YOU MIGHT AS WELL ASK,

377
00:10:07,872 --> 00:10:09,707
DOES MOOSE THOMPSON EXIST?

378
00:10:09,707 --> 00:10:11,075
OR IF MR. GREEN'S WIFE,

379
00:10:11,075 --> 00:10:12,610
BERNICE, EXISTS.

380
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,811
WELL, BERNICE BETTER EXIST.

381
00:10:13,811 --> 00:10:14,646
OTHERWISE, I'VE BEEN LETTING

382
00:10:14,646 --> 00:10:15,980
HER PARENTS VISIT FOR NO GOOD

383
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,881
REASON.

384
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:19,851
[laughter and applause]

385
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,054
YOU KNOW, IT'S GONNA BE A

386
00:10:23,054 --> 00:10:23,922
TERRIBLE WORLD TO LIVE IN

387
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:25,557
WITHOUT SANTA CLAUS.

388
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:27,125
WELL, YOU KNOW, I THINK THIS

389
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,660
LETTER ADDRESSES A GOOD POINT.

390
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,128
I NEVER GOT ANY PRESENTS FROM

391
00:10:30,128 --> 00:10:31,996
SANTA WHEN I WAS A KID.

392
00:10:31,996 --> 00:10:33,197
YOU KNOW, SO MAYBE HE DOESN'T

393
00:10:33,197 --> 00:10:33,798
EXIST.

394
00:10:33,798 --> 00:10:34,632
WELL, MIKE, YOU WERE

395
00:10:34,632 --> 00:10:36,301
A ROTTEN KID.

396
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:37,568
THAT'S WHY SANTA DIDN'T BRING

397
00:10:37,568 --> 00:10:39,537
YOU ANY PRESENTS.

398
00:10:39,537 --> 00:10:41,739
YOU STOLE MY BICYCLE.

399
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:42,573
WELL, HOW DO YOU KNOW

400
00:10:42,573 --> 00:10:44,075
IT WAS ME?

401
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:45,043
'CAUSE YOU USED TO RIDE BACK

402
00:10:45,043 --> 00:10:46,110
AND FORTH IN FRONT OF MY

403
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,345
HOUSE, RIDING IT AND WAVING

404
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:49,580
AND LAUGHING.

405
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,381
OH, YEAH.

406
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:52,283
[laughing]

407
00:10:52,283 --> 00:10:53,918
WELL, TO ANSWER OUR--OUR

408
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:55,086
VIEWER THERE, I'D JUST LIKE TO

409
00:10:55,086 --> 00:10:57,722
SAY THAT HAROLD HERE EXISTS,

410
00:10:57,722 --> 00:10:59,290
SO SANTA CLAUS MUST EXIST,

411
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,793
OTHERWISE LIFE ISN'T FAIR.

412
00:11:01,793 --> 00:11:03,594
[laughter]

413
00:11:03,594 --> 00:11:05,196
I'LL TELL YOU, SANTA CLAUS

414
00:11:05,196 --> 00:11:06,998
EXISTS AS SURELY AS POSSUM

415
00:11:06,998 --> 00:11:08,933
LODGE EXISTS.

416
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:10,034
I KNOW SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO

417
00:11:10,034 --> 00:11:11,369
BELIEVE IN A CHUBBY GUY WITH A

418
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:12,670
BEARD, BUT YOU'LL GET

419
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,905
USED TO IT.

420
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:16,874
[laughter and applause]

421
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:23,514
CHRISTMAS IS, I GUESS,

422
00:11:23,514 --> 00:11:24,849
SHARING.

423
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:26,584
GIVING SOMETHING OF YOURSELF.

424
00:11:26,584 --> 00:11:27,685
SHARING A GIFT.

425
00:11:27,685 --> 00:11:29,020
SHARING A MEAL.

426
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,388
SHARING SOME GOOD CHEER.

427
00:11:30,388 --> 00:11:31,422
MAYBE EVEN SHARING SOME BAD

428
00:11:31,422 --> 00:11:32,890
WINE.

429
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:33,758
NOW, THE REAL INTENTION WAS

430
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:34,559
PROBABLY TO SHARE WITH THOSE

431
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,527
LESS FORTUNATE THAN ME, BUT

432
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:37,462
THOSE PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS

433
00:11:37,462 --> 00:11:38,896
INSULTED THAT I THINK I'M MORE

434
00:11:38,896 --> 00:11:40,431
FORTUNATE THAN THEM OR

435
00:11:40,431 --> 00:11:42,066
FORTUNATE AT ALL.

436
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:43,267
SO I GUESS CHRISTMAS IS THE

437
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:44,635
TIME OF YEAR WHEN WE FEED AND

438
00:11:44,635 --> 00:11:46,971
INVITE INTO OUR HOMES PEOPLE

439
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:47,705
WHO REALLY DON'T NEED TO BE

440
00:11:47,705 --> 00:11:49,941
FED AND HAVE HOMES OF THEIR OWN.

441
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:51,576
AT LEAST, THAT'S WHAT I DO.

442
00:11:51,576 --> 00:11:53,177
I JUST FOCUS MY GENEROSITY ON

443
00:11:53,177 --> 00:11:54,812
FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

444
00:11:54,812 --> 00:11:55,913
THAT WAY, THERE'S A BETTER

445
00:11:55,913 --> 00:11:57,615
CHANCE OF A PAYBACK, OR AS I

446
00:11:57,615 --> 00:12:02,153
CALL IT, SHARING.

447
00:12:02,854 --> 00:12:03,855
WELL, I DO--I DO A CHRISTMAS

448
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:05,356
COUNTDOWN THING.

449
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:06,057
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME WHEN

450
00:12:06,057 --> 00:12:06,924
CHRISTMAS IS, BECAUSE THE BEER

451
00:12:06,924 --> 00:12:08,593
STORES ARE CLOSED.

452
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:10,962
BUT...

453
00:12:10,962 --> 00:12:12,563
I DON'T LIKE THE THING THAT

454
00:12:12,563 --> 00:12:13,464
HAROLD DID, THE MOOSE WITH THE

455
00:12:13,464 --> 00:12:14,565
LINKS AND ALL THAT STUFF.

456
00:12:14,565 --> 00:12:16,367
I'M MORE OF A HANDYMAN THAN A

457
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:18,769
CRAFTY GOOF.

458
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:19,971
I LIKE THE IDEA OF THE CHAIN

459
00:12:19,971 --> 00:12:20,571
LINKS, THOUGH.

460
00:12:20,571 --> 00:12:22,506
BUT I SAY...

461
00:12:22,506 --> 00:12:24,075
LET'S USE A REAL CHAIN.

462
00:12:24,075 --> 00:12:26,177
[laughter]

463
00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:27,578
SURE, MAYBE IT'S HEAVY, AND IT'S

464
00:12:27,578 --> 00:12:29,146
OILY AND DIRTY AND SO ON, BUT

465
00:12:29,146 --> 00:12:32,183
YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE IT.

466
00:12:32,183 --> 00:12:34,385
IT'S ALREADY THERE.

467
00:12:34,385 --> 00:12:35,286
YOU JUST HANG THAT UP ON THE

468
00:12:35,286 --> 00:12:37,121
WALL.

469
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:39,256
AND YOU GET YOUR BOLT CUTTER

470
00:12:39,256 --> 00:12:40,992
AND...

471
00:12:40,992 --> 00:12:42,560
EVERY TIME A DAY GOES BY, YOU

472
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,131
JUST--YOU JUST...

473
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:50,001
YOU JUST...

474
00:12:50,001 --> 00:12:53,070
[laughter]

475
00:12:57,608 --> 00:12:59,643
I'M FINISHED HAVING MY FAMILY.

476
00:12:59,643 --> 00:13:02,613
[laughter]

477
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,418
ALL RIGHT, WELL, YOU GET THE

478
00:13:07,418 --> 00:13:10,020
IDEA ON THAT.

479
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,821
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GO WITH A

480
00:13:10,821 --> 00:13:11,922
HEAVIER CHAIN, MAYBE IT WOULD

481
00:13:11,922 --> 00:13:13,858
BE BETTER TO JUST KIND OF LET

482
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:14,925
A FEW DAYS GO BY.

483
00:13:14,925 --> 00:13:16,394
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

484
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:18,429
SO YOU LET FOUR DAYS GO BY.

485
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:19,730
NOW YOU JUST CUT THAT LINK.

486
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:20,664
AND THEN ALL THE DAYS.

487
00:13:20,664 --> 00:13:21,298
THAT'S WHAT TO DO.

488
00:13:21,298 --> 00:13:22,500
JUST CUT--JUST CUT EVERY FOUR

489
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,400
DAYS.

490
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,236
OR, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU COULD DO,

491
00:13:25,236 --> 00:13:26,904
IS JUST HANG IT UP AND WAIT

492
00:13:26,904 --> 00:13:29,173
FOR ALL THE DAYS TO GO BY.

493
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:30,074
THEN, ON CHRISTMAS MORNING,

494
00:13:30,074 --> 00:13:31,375
FIRST THING YOU DO...

495
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,109
[chains crashing]

496
00:13:32,109 --> 00:13:33,611
TAKE THE CHAIN DOWN.

497
00:13:33,611 --> 00:13:35,780
THAT'S THE HANDYMAN WAY.

498
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,215
[cheers and applause]

499
00:13:40,351 --> 00:13:41,385
'TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE

500
00:13:41,385 --> 00:13:43,320
CHRISTMAS, WHEN ALL AROUND THE

501
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,889
LODGE, NOT A VEHICLE WAS

502
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:48,125
STIRRING, NOT EVEN MY DODGE.

503
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,293
THE STOCKINGS WERE HUNG BY

504
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:50,561
THE CHIMNEY WITH CARE, IN

505
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:51,729
HOPES THAT THEY'D STINK LESS

506
00:13:51,729 --> 00:13:54,465
IF THEY'D GOTTEN SOME AIR.

507
00:13:54,465 --> 00:13:55,432
THE LODGE MEMBERS WERE

508
00:13:55,432 --> 00:13:56,734
NESTLED, CLOTHED IN THEIR

509
00:13:56,734 --> 00:13:57,868
BEDS, WHILE VISIONS OF

510
00:13:57,868 --> 00:13:59,003
HANGOVERS STOMPED ON THEIR

511
00:13:59,003 --> 00:14:01,572
HEADS.

512
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:03,107
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU YOUNG

513
00:14:03,107 --> 00:14:04,008
PEOPLE OUT THERE ABOUT ONE OF

514
00:14:04,008 --> 00:14:05,209
THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF

515
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:09,480
CHRISTMAS: THE GIFTS.

516
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,314
AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE

517
00:14:10,314 --> 00:14:10,915
GIFTS YOU GET.

518
00:14:10,915 --> 00:14:11,815
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE ONES YOU

519
00:14:11,815 --> 00:14:13,417
WERE SUPPOSED TO GIVE, OKAY?

520
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:14,551
LIKE, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE ON A

521
00:14:14,551 --> 00:14:15,519
LIMITED BUDGET LIKE THE WAY I

522
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,754
AM, YOU KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT

523
00:14:16,754 --> 00:14:17,488
IS TO SPREAD THE AMOUNT OF

524
00:14:17,488 --> 00:14:18,656
MONEY THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE

525
00:14:18,656 --> 00:14:19,490
TO THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WHO

526
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,491
ARE ON YOUR LIST, RIGHT?

527
00:14:20,491 --> 00:14:21,258
WAH, WAH?

00:14:21,258 --> 00:14:23,594
YEAH?

529
00:14:23,594 --> 00:14:24,495
THAT'S HARD.

530
00:14:24,495 --> 00:14:25,462
AND PLUS, HERE'S A QUANDARY FOR

531
00:14:25,462 --> 00:14:26,864
YOU: HOW MUCH--HOW ARE YOU

532
00:14:26,864 --> 00:14:27,698
GONNA KNOW TO SPEND THE SAME

533
00:14:27,698 --> 00:14:28,766
AMOUNT ON THE PERSON THAT JUST

534
00:14:28,766 --> 00:14:29,900
BUYING FOR, THAT THEY SPENT ON

535
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,236
YOU?

536
00:14:32,236 --> 00:14:33,671
THE ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT?

537
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:37,975
FIND OUT WHAT THEY BOUGHT YOU.

538
00:14:37,975 --> 00:14:38,809
AND HOW DO YOU DO THIS, YOU

539
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:39,476
ASK YOURSELF?

540
00:14:39,476 --> 00:14:40,577
WAH, WAH, WAH.

541
00:14:40,577 --> 00:14:42,112
WELL, THE ANSWER IS SIMPLICITY

542
00:14:42,112 --> 00:14:43,847
ITSELF.

543
00:14:43,847 --> 00:14:44,615
TEAR THE HOUSE APART WHEN

544
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:46,417
EVERYBODY GOES OUT.

545
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:47,484
IT'S TRUE, OKAY?

546
00:14:47,484 --> 00:14:48,352
I RECOMMEND THAT YOU START IN

547
00:14:48,352 --> 00:14:49,253
THE BACK BEDROOM CLOSETS.

548
00:14:49,253 --> 00:14:50,120
GET IN THERE, RIFLE AROUND,

549
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,888
OKAY?

550
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:52,189
IF IT'S A WOMAN WHO HID THESE

551
00:14:52,189 --> 00:14:53,457
PRESENTS, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DO

552
00:14:53,457 --> 00:14:53,957
THEN?

553
00:14:53,957 --> 00:14:55,059
YOU GOT TO ROOMS WHERE MEN NEVER

554
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:56,193
GO.

555
00:14:56,193 --> 00:14:57,494
THAT'S WHERE THEY HIDE THEM.

556
00:14:57,494 --> 00:14:58,495
THESE ROOMS BEING THE LAUNDRY

557
00:14:58,495 --> 00:14:59,530
ROOM, THE PANTRY, THE

558
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,031
KITCHEN--THIS IS EXCLUDING THE

FRIDGE, NATURALLY.

560
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:04,635

00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,474
OKAY, NOW WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU

564
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:11,442
FIND A PRESENT AND IT'S

565

UNWRAPPED?

566
00:15:11,942 --> 00:15:12,443
WHO'S IT FOR?

WAH, WAH, WAH.

00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:15,679
OKAY.

570
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,914
MAYBE IT'S A GIFT THAT YOU

KIND OF ASKED FOR.

572
00:15:18,582 --> 00:15:19,650
IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING YOU WOULD

WANT.

574
00:15:21,385 --> 00:15:23,654
IT'S PROBABLY YOURS.

HOW ABOUT MAKING A ONE-HORSE

OPEN SLEIGH FROM A 100-HORSE

CONVERTIBLE.

676
00:18:05,682 --> 00:18:06,549
SO THE FIRST STEP IS TO GET THE

677
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:08,351
ROOF RIGHT OFF THE UNIT.

678
00:18:08,351 --> 00:18:10,086

IT'S NOT REALLY AS HARD AS IT

681
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:15,191
LOOKS TO DO THAT.

682
00:18:15,191 --> 00:18:16,226
WHAT YOU DO IS, YOU JUST COME

684
00:18:17,394 --> 00:18:18,662
ACCIDENTALLY SIT ON THE REMOTE.

00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:20,263
DOWN THE DOOR--IT JUST PEELS

686
00:18:20,263 --> 00:18:21,731
IT RIGHT OFF, CLEAN.

687
00:18:21,731 --> 00:18:23,233
BUT DON'T FORGET TO DUCK.

688
00:18:23,233 --> 00:18:24,501
ALL RIGHT, NOW, WE'RE GONNA PUT

689
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:26,136
A OLD-FASHIONED, HIGH OPEN

690
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:27,771
SLEIGH DRIVER SEAT INTO THIS

691
00:18:27,771 --> 00:18:28,271
UNIT.

692
00:18:28,271 --> 00:18:29,239
SO WHAT I GOT TO DO IS, FIRST

693
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:30,707
OF ALL, GET THE OLD SEAT OUT

694
00:18:30,707 --> 00:18:31,675
OF THERE.

695
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:34,644
[clanking]

696
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:38,314
THERE WE GO, AND...

697
00:18:38,314 --> 00:18:40,150
OH, LOOKS LIKE SOME OF THE FLOOR

698
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,452
COME UP WITH THE SEAT THERE.

699
00:18:42,452 --> 00:18:43,253
NOW, THAT--NO, THAT'S A GOOD

700
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:43,753
THING.

701
00:18:43,753 --> 00:18:44,587
THAT'S A GOOD THING 'CAUSE WE

702
00:18:44,587 --> 00:18:45,455
CAN SEE RIGHT DOWN THROUGH THE

703
00:18:45,455 --> 00:18:46,689
FLOOR WHEN WE'RE DRIVING.

704
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:47,357
THAT'S ALWAYS HANDY.

705
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:48,425
AND, YOU KNOW, IF YOU RUN OVER

706
00:18:48,425 --> 00:18:49,759
SOMEBODY, YOU GET A CHANCE TO

707
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:51,094
APOLOGIZE TO THEM AS THEY GO BY

708
00:18:51,094 --> 00:18:53,430
THE HOLE.

709
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:54,697
WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE ANY

710
00:18:54,697 --> 00:18:56,199
ANTIQUE SLEIGH SEATS, BUT WE

711
00:18:56,199 --> 00:18:57,801
DO HAVE A LOT OF TALL

712
00:18:57,801 --> 00:18:59,969
BARSTOOLS.

713
00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:01,104
THE TRICK IS FINDING AN EMPTY

714
00:19:01,104 --> 00:19:02,639
ONE, ESPECIALLY THIS

715
00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:03,640
TIME OF YEAR.

716
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,641
SO I'M GONNA STICK THE STOOL

717
00:19:04,641 --> 00:19:06,309
BEHIND THE HOLE, AND I'M GONNA

718
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:07,577
SNUG HER DOWN THERE WITH THE

719
00:19:07,577 --> 00:19:09,279
HANDYMAN'S SECRET WEAPON, DUCT

720
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:10,046
TAPE.

721
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:10,780
I'LL TELL YOU THE PROBLEM,

722
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,281
THOUGH.

723
00:19:11,281 --> 00:19:12,448
IN THE COLD WEATHER, THE DUCT

724
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:13,683
TAPE JUST DOESN'T STICK VERY

725
00:19:13,683 --> 00:19:14,184
WELL.

726
00:19:14,184 --> 00:19:14,984
BUT HERE'S A TRICK I LEARNED

727
00:19:14,984 --> 00:19:15,718
FROM MY FRIENDS UP IN

728
00:19:15,718 --> 00:19:16,352
YELLOWKNIFE.

729
00:19:16,352 --> 00:19:17,854
WHAT YOU DO IS, YOU KEEP THE

730
00:19:17,854 --> 00:19:19,455
DUCT TAPE INSIDE YOUR CLOTHES

731
00:19:19,455 --> 00:19:20,390
NEXT TO YOUR SKIN.

732
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,025
AND YOUR BODY HEAT KEEPS IT

733
00:19:22,025 --> 00:19:26,663
STICKY.

734
00:19:26,663 --> 00:19:27,430
OH, YEAH, THERE WE GO.

735
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:31,901
OH, NO.

736
00:19:31,901 --> 00:19:34,370
WHAT THE HECK IS THAT?

737
00:19:35,371 --> 00:19:36,239
THERE, THAT'S PERFECT.

738
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:37,273
TOOK ME A LITTLE WHILE TO FIND

739
00:19:37,273 --> 00:19:38,341
THE DUCT TAPE, BECAUSE I FORGOT

740
00:19:38,341 --> 00:19:40,577
I HAD CHANGED MY UNDERWEAR.

741
00:19:40,577 --> 00:19:41,678
YOU KNOW, THE "K" CAR WAS NEVER

742
00:19:41,678 --> 00:19:43,179
ACTUALLY BUILT FOR SPEED, BUT

743
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:44,280
EVEN THIS UNIT HAS A FEW MORE

744
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,882
PONIES THAN WE NEED UNDER THE

745
00:19:45,882 --> 00:19:47,383
HOOD FOR OUR SLEIGH.

746
00:19:47,383 --> 00:19:48,651
WHAT WE WANT IS JUST TO HAVE A

747
00:19:48,651 --> 00:19:49,953
ONE-HORSE UNIT.

748
00:19:49,953 --> 00:19:51,421
SO I THINK I'M GONNA HAVE TO

749
00:19:51,421 --> 00:19:52,855
UNHARNESS A FEW.

750
00:19:52,855 --> 00:19:53,356
WE WANT A--

751
00:19:53,356 --> 00:19:53,856
pop!

752
00:19:53,856 --> 00:19:54,357
ONE-HORSE...

753
00:19:54,357 --> 00:19:54,857
pop!

754
00:19:54,857 --> 00:19:55,825
ONE-CYLINDER...

755
00:19:55,825 --> 00:19:56,392
pop!

756
00:19:56,392 --> 00:19:58,995
OPEN SLEIGH.

757
00:19:58,995 --> 00:20:00,396
GOSH, I HOPE I'M USING ONE OF

758
00:20:00,396 --> 00:20:03,599
THE CYLINDERS THAT STILL WORKS.

759
00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:06,402
OF COURSE, THE KIDS ARE GONNA BE

760
00:20:06,402 --> 00:20:07,103
BUGGING, YOU KNOW.

761
00:20:07,103 --> 00:20:07,804
"WHERE'S THE HORSE?

762
00:20:07,804 --> 00:20:08,972
WHERE'S THE HORSE?"

763
00:20:08,972 --> 00:20:10,273
AND RATHER THAN MAKE UP SOME

764
00:20:10,273 --> 00:20:11,307
DUMB, POLITICALLY CORRECT

765
00:20:11,307 --> 00:20:13,276
STORY ABOUT SOME CHRISTMAS HORSE

766
00:20:13,276 --> 00:20:14,844
THAT GOES OFF TO UNIVERSITY TO

767
00:20:14,844 --> 00:20:16,179
AVOID A LIFE OF MANUAL

768
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:18,081
LABOR--INSTEAD OF THAT, WE'RE

769
00:20:18,081 --> 00:20:19,916
GONNA MAKE A HORSE...

770
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,385
OUT OF WHAT'S LEFT OF THE ROOF.

771
00:20:22,385 --> 00:20:23,486
SHOULD BE A SNAP TO CUT A HORSE

772
00:20:23,486 --> 00:20:26,422
SHAPE OUT OF THAT.

773
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:29,425
BOY, THIS HAS TURNED OUT GREAT.

774
00:20:29,425 --> 00:20:31,994
LOOK AT THIS THING.

775
00:20:31,994 --> 00:20:32,895
OH, BABY, YEAH.

776
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,665
OH, MAN, THAT'S FANTASTIC.

777
00:20:35,665 --> 00:20:39,168
[laughter]

778
00:20:39,168 --> 00:20:40,236
YOU KNOW, IF I'D SET THE TORCH

779
00:20:40,236 --> 00:20:41,104
A LITTLE HOTTER, I COULD HAVE

780
00:20:41,104 --> 00:20:43,506
CUT OUT TWO HORSES.

781
00:20:46,576 --> 00:20:47,376
YOU KNOW, KIDS HAVE GREAT

782
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:48,544
IMAGINATIONS, DON'T THEY?

783
00:20:48,544 --> 00:20:49,645
YOU KNOW, THEY--THEY SEE CASTLES

784
00:20:49,645 --> 00:20:50,546
IN CLOUDS.

785
00:20:50,546 --> 00:20:53,149
THEY SEE FACES IN TURNIPS.

786
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:56,385
THEY'LL SEE A HORSE IN THAT.

787
00:20:56,385 --> 00:20:57,453
ALL RIGHT, NOW, WHAT I'M GONNA

788
00:20:57,453 --> 00:20:58,554
DO IS, I'M GONNA CUT A GROOVE

789
00:20:58,554 --> 00:20:59,755
INTO THE HOOD OF THE "K" CAR SO

790
00:20:59,755 --> 00:21:01,190
THAT I CAN MOUNT THE HORSE IN

791
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,459
THERE GOOD AND SOLID.

792
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:06,429
[drilling]

793
00:21:07,997 --> 00:21:10,967
[hissing]

794
00:21:16,105 --> 00:21:17,707
NOW, THESE ARE OBVIOUSLY THE

795
00:21:17,707 --> 00:21:18,674
REINS HERE, WHICH I'M GONNA

796
00:21:18,674 --> 00:21:19,542
USE TO STEER THE END.

797
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:20,376
AND I GOT THEM RUNNING THROUGH

798
00:21:20,376 --> 00:21:21,177
THE STEERING WHEEL, SO WHEN I

799
00:21:21,177 --> 00:21:22,545
WANT TO TURN, I JUST PULL ON

800
00:21:22,545 --> 00:21:23,646
THE REIN AND THE STEERING

801
00:21:23,646 --> 00:21:24,213
WHEEL WILL TURN.

802
00:21:24,213 --> 00:21:25,748
WON'T BE A SHARP TURN, BUT I'M

803
00:21:25,748 --> 00:21:26,916
GUESSING PEOPLE WILL GET OUT OF

804
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,150
THE WAY.

805
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,986
ALL RIGHT, NOW, WHAT I'VE DONE

806
00:21:29,986 --> 00:21:31,320
IS, I'VE CRANKED THE IDLING WAY

807
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,588
UP ON HER THERE, SO I DON'T HAVE

808
00:21:32,588 --> 00:21:33,789
TO GO NEAR THE--NEAR THE GAS

809
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:34,824
PEDAL AT ALL.

810
00:21:34,824 --> 00:21:36,158
AND I'M GONNA USE A RIDING CROP

811
00:21:36,158 --> 00:21:38,194
TO CHANGE GEARS.

812
00:21:38,194 --> 00:21:39,328
WELL, IT'S NOT A REAL RIDING

813
00:21:39,328 --> 00:21:39,829
CROP.

814
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:40,663
THIS IS A--THIS IS A RADIO

815
00:21:40,663 --> 00:21:41,931
AERIAL, BUT IT'S A POWER--LOOK

816
00:21:41,931 --> 00:21:44,867
AT THIS.

817
00:21:44,867 --> 00:21:45,501
HUH?

818
00:21:45,501 --> 00:21:46,702
IS THAT BEAUTIFUL?

819
00:21:46,702 --> 00:21:47,603
[laughing]

820
00:21:47,603 --> 00:21:48,871
ACTUALLY, I WANTED A REAL RIDING

821
00:21:48,871 --> 00:21:49,472
CROP.

822
00:21:49,472 --> 00:21:50,373
I WENT INTO THE STORE.

823
00:21:50,373 --> 00:21:51,674
I SAYS TO THE GUY, "ARE THE

824
00:21:51,674 --> 00:21:52,675
CROPS IN?"

825
00:21:52,675 --> 00:21:54,543
WOULDN'T EVEN SERVE ME.

826
00:21:54,543 --> 00:21:55,645
ALL RIGHT, SO--OH, I WANTED TO

827
00:21:55,645 --> 00:21:56,746
SAY ONE OTHER FEATURE I'VE

828
00:21:56,746 --> 00:21:58,047
ADDED TO THIS THING.

829
00:21:58,047 --> 00:21:59,582
I ADDED A COUPLE OF THOSE FAKE

830
00:21:59,582 --> 00:22:01,717
POLY-FOAM, POLYSTYRENE

831
00:22:01,717 --> 00:22:03,219
PLASTIC CANDY CANES.

832
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:04,220
GOT THEM HANGING DOWN BY THE

833
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:04,720
WHEELS.

834
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,489
THEY LOOK LIKE RUNNERS, HUH?

835
00:22:06,489 --> 00:22:07,723
OF COURSE, NOW, THOSE ARE JUST

836
00:22:07,723 --> 00:22:09,058
FAKE RUNNERS, YOU KNOW.

837
00:22:09,058 --> 00:22:10,326
'CAUSE RIGHT NOW WE'RE MAINLY

838
00:22:10,326 --> 00:22:11,527
GOING FOR LOOKS.

839
00:22:11,527 --> 00:22:13,663
AND I BET WE GET A FEW.

840
00:22:13,663 --> 00:22:15,231
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN DON'T

841
00:22:15,231 --> 00:22:16,832
FIND YOU HANDSOME, THEY SHOULD

842
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,634
AT LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

843
00:22:18,634 --> 00:22:21,737
ON DONNER, ON BLITZEN, ON ARES.

844
00:22:21,737 --> 00:22:24,640
[banging]

845
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,675
AH.

846
00:22:29,945 --> 00:22:34,383
[applause]

847
00:22:37,486 --> 00:22:38,654
RIGHT, NOW, WE'RE COUNTING DOWN

848
00:22:38,654 --> 00:22:40,589
THE DAYS UNTIL CHRISTMAS.

849
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:42,057
AND I--RANGER GORD HERE.

850
00:22:42,057 --> 00:22:43,125
RANGER GORD, I UNDERSTAND THAT

851
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,860
WHEN YOU WERE UP IN THE FIRE

852
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,495
WATCHTOWER THERE FOR 18 YEARS...

853
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:47,196
MM-HM.

854
00:22:47,196 --> 00:22:48,764
WE USED TO MAKE THE--THE

855
00:22:48,764 --> 00:22:50,332
ADVENT CALENDARS WITH THE LITTLE

856
00:22:50,332 --> 00:22:51,367
TABS AND THE CHOCOLATES INSIDE

857
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:51,867
THEM.

858
00:22:51,867 --> 00:22:52,601
ABSOLUTELY.

859
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:53,102
YEAH.

860
00:22:53,102 --> 00:22:54,436
WELL, NOT CHOCOLATE INSIDE,

861
00:22:54,436 --> 00:22:56,038
BUT TREATS, NONETHELESS.

862
00:22:56,038 --> 00:22:56,639
FOREST TREATS.

863
00:22:56,639 --> 00:22:57,139
OH, YEAH.

864
00:22:57,139 --> 00:22:57,873
YEAH, TREATS OTHER

865
00:22:57,873 --> 00:22:59,041
CREATURES HAD DROPPED IN THE

866
00:22:59,041 --> 00:22:59,542
WOODS.

867
00:22:59,542 --> 00:23:01,076
[laughter]

868
00:23:01,076 --> 00:23:03,279
YOU KNOW, FOLKS, I DIDN'T

869
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:04,847
JUST DO THE 25 DAYS BEFORE

870
00:23:04,847 --> 00:23:05,581
CHRISTMAS.

871
00:23:05,581 --> 00:23:09,919
I DID THE ENTIRE YEAR--388 DAYS.

872
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,053
WELL--WELL, GORD, THERE'S

873
00:23:11,053 --> 00:23:15,191
ONLY 365 DAYS IN A YEAR.

874
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:16,692
[laughter]

875
00:23:16,692 --> 00:23:17,626
365?

876
00:23:17,626 --> 00:23:19,261
YEAH.

877
00:23:19,261 --> 00:23:20,996
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, YEAH.

878
00:23:20,996 --> 00:23:21,764
ALL RIGHT, WELL, THAT WOULD

879
00:23:21,764 --> 00:23:22,731
EXPLAIN WHY, AFTER A COUPLE OF

880
00:23:22,731 --> 00:23:23,799
YEARS, IT WAS HOT AND SUNNY AT

881
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:24,967
CHRISTMAS, AND COLD AND SNOWY

882
00:23:24,967 --> 00:23:26,835
IN JULY.

883
00:23:26,835 --> 00:23:27,903
WELL, THAT--THAT WOULD

884
00:23:27,903 --> 00:23:30,839
EXPLAIN PART OF IT.

885
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:32,107
WELL, ANYWAYS, FOLKS, NOW

886
00:23:32,107 --> 00:23:33,576
THAT I'M BACK IN CIVILIZATION,

887
00:23:33,576 --> 00:23:35,110
I HAVE DEVELOPED A FOOLPROOF,

888
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,745
EXTREMELY SIMPLE WAY OF COUNTING

889
00:23:36,745 --> 00:23:38,147
DOWN THE DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS

890
00:23:38,147 --> 00:23:40,049
THAT MAKE ALL OTHER WAYS SEEM

891
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:42,217
EXTREMELY COMPLEX BY COMPARISON.

892
00:23:42,217 --> 00:23:44,520
NOW, ALL MY METHOD INVOLVES IS A

893
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,455
SIMPLE PERMANENT MARKER, A

894
00:23:46,455 --> 00:23:48,557
SIMPLE CALENDAR, AND A SIMPLE

895
00:23:48,557 --> 00:23:50,726
BOWL FILLED WITH BROKEN PIECES

896
00:23:50,726 --> 00:23:52,361
OF SPAGHETTI AND METAL

897
00:23:52,361 --> 00:23:53,796
SHAVINGS FILLED TO THE BRIM

898
00:23:53,796 --> 00:23:55,898
WITH HOT BOILING WATER AND

899
00:23:55,898 --> 00:23:57,132
STIRRED VERY RAPIDLY UNTIL IT

900
00:23:57,132 --> 00:23:59,702
MAKES A STRANGE NOISE.

901
00:24:06,342 --> 00:24:08,277
YOU KNOW WHAT?

902
00:24:08,277 --> 00:24:09,378
LET'S FORGET ABOUT THE BOWL

903
00:24:09,378 --> 00:24:10,479
RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE IT'S NOT THAT

904
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:11,080
IMPORTANT.

905
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,115
OW, GOD.

906
00:24:13,115 --> 00:24:15,884
OKAY...

907
00:24:15,884 --> 00:24:16,685
ALL RIGHT, WELL, HERE'S MY

908
00:24:16,685 --> 00:24:17,352
METHOD.

909
00:24:17,352 --> 00:24:18,520
YOU SIMPLY TAKE THE PERMANENT

910
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,823
MARKER, AND YOU CROSS OUT ALL

911
00:24:20,823 --> 00:24:22,991
THE DAYS BETWEEN NOW AND

912
00:24:22,991 --> 00:24:24,993
CHRISTMAS, OKAY?

913
00:24:24,993 --> 00:24:28,297
ARE YOU WITH ME SO FAR?

914
00:24:28,297 --> 00:24:29,198
OKAY.

915
00:24:29,198 --> 00:24:31,467
THEN YOU TAKE THE ERASER, AND

916
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:34,803
YOU ERASE THE DAYS AS THEY PASS.

917
00:24:50,285 --> 00:24:52,888
OKAY, NOW, YOU PROBABLY HAVE

918
00:24:52,888 --> 00:24:54,990
NOTICED, PERMANENT MARKER IS

919
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:57,092
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO GET OUT.

920
00:24:57,092 --> 00:24:58,260
SO YOU HAVE TO RUB VERY

921
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,128
VIGOROUSLY.

922
00:25:00,128 --> 00:25:02,698
[paper tearing]

923
00:25:02,698 --> 00:25:04,800
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, SO--SO,

924
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,068
NOW, AFTER YOU'VE RIPPED THE

925
00:25:06,068 --> 00:25:10,405
CALENDAR, THEN WHAT?

926
00:25:10,405 --> 00:25:11,573
RIGHT, WELL, AFTER YOU'VE RIPPED

927
00:25:11,573 --> 00:25:13,642
THE CALENDAR, YOU DECIDE THAT

928
00:25:13,642 --> 00:25:15,210
YOU'RE GOING TO RIP OUT THE DATE

929
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,079
INSTEAD OF USING THE ERASER ON

930
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:18,447
THE PERMANENT MARKER.

931
00:25:18,447 --> 00:25:21,016
SIMPLE, OKAY?

932
00:25:26,054 --> 00:25:26,822
OKAY.

933
00:25:26,822 --> 00:25:28,223
OKAY.

934
00:25:28,223 --> 00:25:29,291
ALL RIGHT, NOW THAT YOU'VE

935
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:30,492
RIPPED OUT MOST OF THE DATES

936
00:25:30,492 --> 00:25:32,461
AND YOU'VE EXPOSED MOST OF

937
00:25:32,461 --> 00:25:33,762
JANUARY UNDERNEATH, WHICH, YOU

938
00:25:33,762 --> 00:25:35,163
KNOW, REALLY CONFUSES AND

939
00:25:35,163 --> 00:25:38,433
FRUSTRATES YOU, YOU--YOU TAKE

940
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:39,468
OUT YOUR MATCHES AND SET THE

941
00:25:39,468 --> 00:25:40,636
CALENDAR ON FIRE.

942
00:25:40,636 --> 00:25:42,070
NO, NO, NO.

943
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:45,240
[laughter]

944
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,742
OKAY, WELL, YOU GET THE IDEA.

945
00:25:46,742 --> 00:25:47,909
HAVE SOME FUN, OKAY?

946
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:50,145
AND REMEMBER, ONLY 422 MORE

947
00:25:50,145 --> 00:25:53,115
SHOPPING DAYS TILL CHRISTMAS.

948
00:25:53,115 --> 00:25:53,715
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

949
00:25:53,715 --> 00:25:56,685
[cheers and applause]

950
00:25:57,452 --> 00:25:58,553
AND I IN MY RETAINER, AND

951
00:25:58,553 --> 00:26:00,055
UNCLE RED IN HIS CAP, HAD JUST

952
00:26:00,055 --> 00:26:01,256
CRASHED ON SOME COUCHES FOR A

953
00:26:01,256 --> 00:26:03,392
POST-TURKEY NAP.

954
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,493
WHEN OUT ON THE LAWN THERE

955
00:26:04,493 --> 00:26:05,894
AROSE SUCH A SMELL, I DASHED

956
00:26:05,894 --> 00:26:07,596
TO THE WINDOW TO SEE WHAT THE--

957
00:26:07,596 --> 00:26:09,731
HECK, HECK.

958
00:26:09,731 --> 00:26:11,266
AWAY TO THE WINDOW I FLEW

959
00:26:11,266 --> 00:26:12,434
LIKE A FLASH TO OPEN THE

960
00:26:12,434 --> 00:26:13,435
SHUTTERS, WHICH FELL OFF AND

961
00:26:13,435 --> 00:26:14,236
WENT SMASH.

962
00:26:14,236 --> 00:26:15,971
SORRY.

963
00:26:15,971 --> 00:26:17,272
THE MOON ON THE CREST OF THE

964
00:26:17,272 --> 00:26:19,274
NEW-FALLEN SNOW COULDN'T HIDE

965
00:26:19,274 --> 00:26:20,542
WHERE THE SEPTICS HAD ALL

966
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:25,280
OVERFLOWED.

967
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,481
WHEN WHAT TO MY WONDERING EYES

968
00:26:26,481 --> 00:26:27,716
SHOULD APPEAR BUT A MINIVAN

969
00:26:27,716 --> 00:26:30,619
FULL OF WOMEN AND BEER.

970
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:33,588
[laughter and applause]

971
00:26:34,523 --> 00:26:36,091
WITH A DRIVER IN VINYL AND

972
00:26:36,091 --> 00:26:37,793
ARTIFICIAL FLEECE, I KNEW IN A

973
00:26:37,793 --> 00:26:41,429
FLASH IT WAS MY WIFE, BERNICE.

974
00:26:44,065 --> 00:26:45,534
I'M GONNA TALK TO YOU OLDER GUYS

975
00:26:45,534 --> 00:26:47,836
ABOUT TELLING THE TRUTH.

976
00:26:47,836 --> 00:26:51,206
THE TRUTH ABOUT SANTA.

977
00:26:51,206 --> 00:26:52,607
'CAUSE YOU KNOW SOME NAIVE KID

978
00:26:52,607 --> 00:26:54,276
IS GONNA SAY TO YOU, "SHOULD I

979
00:26:54,276 --> 00:26:55,844
BELIEVE IN SANTA?"

980
00:26:55,844 --> 00:26:57,245
WELL, YOU GOT TO LOOK THEM

981
00:26:57,245 --> 00:26:58,446
STRAIGHT IN THE EYE AND SAY,

982
00:26:58,446 --> 00:27:00,549
"YES, HAROLD...

983
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:05,587
[laughter]

984
00:27:05,587 --> 00:27:07,055
OF COURSE YOU BELIEVE IN SANTA."

985
00:27:07,055 --> 00:27:09,090
WHAT'S NOT TO BELIEVE?

986
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,025
YOU KNOW, SANTA'S A PRETTY

987
00:27:10,025 --> 00:27:11,560
AVERAGE, NORMAL GUY.

988
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,128
SPENDS 99% OF HIS TIME

989
00:27:13,128 --> 00:27:16,064
SQUIRRELED AWAY IN HIS WORKSHOP,

990
00:27:16,064 --> 00:27:17,732
MAKING STUFF THAT'S ONLY GOOD

991
00:27:17,732 --> 00:27:20,902
ENOUGH TO GIVE AWAY.

992
00:27:20,902 --> 00:27:24,205
I KNOW LOTS OF GUYS LIKE THAT.

993
00:27:24,205 --> 00:27:25,073
HE'S GOT THESE LITTLE HELPERS

994
00:27:25,073 --> 00:27:26,207
THAT DO ALL THE WORK.

995
00:27:26,207 --> 00:27:28,843
WE ALL HAVE THOSE.

996
00:27:28,843 --> 00:27:30,211
AND EVERY CHRISTMAS, HE LOADS UP

997
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:31,780
WAY TOO MANY GIFTS AND DRIVES

998
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,114
ALL OVER KINGDOM COME

999
00:27:33,114 --> 00:27:34,149
DELIVERING THEM.

1000
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:34,983
THAT SOUND FAMILIAR

1001
00:27:34,983 --> 00:27:37,185
TO YOU AT ALL?

1002
00:27:37,185 --> 00:27:38,153
AND EVERYWHERE HE GOES, HE

1003
00:27:38,153 --> 00:27:39,621
EXPECTS SOME SNACKS AND A DRINK.

1004
00:27:39,621 --> 00:27:42,724
SO DO I.

1005
00:27:42,724 --> 00:27:43,692
AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE CHOICE

1006
00:27:43,692 --> 00:27:45,060
OF DOING THINGS THE EASY WAY OR

1007
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,795
THE HARD WAY, HE CHOOSES THE

1008
00:27:46,795 --> 00:27:49,197
HARD WAY EVERY TIME.

1009
00:27:49,197 --> 00:27:50,565
DOOR VS. CHIMNEY.

1010
00:27:50,565 --> 00:27:53,334
NEED I SAY MORE?

1011
00:27:53,334 --> 00:27:55,070
HE'S JUST ONE OF US, EH?

1012
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,005
PLUS, HE'S FAT; HE'S BALDING; HE

1013
00:27:57,005 --> 00:27:58,306
WEARS RED LONG UNDERWEAR.

1014
00:27:58,306 --> 00:27:59,474
THAT SOUNDS LIKE HALF THE LODGE

1015
00:27:59,474 --> 00:28:01,476
TO ME.

1016
00:28:01,476 --> 00:28:02,811
SO WHEN A KID ASKS YOU IF

1017
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:04,579
THERE'S A SANTA CLAUS, SAY,

1018
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:06,114
"HECK, YEAH, THERE'S PROBABLY

1019
00:28:06,114 --> 00:28:08,783
A COUPLE IN YOUR OWN FAMILY."

1020
00:28:08,783 --> 00:28:10,618
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

1021
00:28:10,618 --> 00:28:12,420

00:28:21,496 --> 00:28:24,466
[cheers and applause]

1027
00:28:27,268 --> 00:28:29,003
SO WHAT DO YOU GOT FOR US TODAY?

1028
00:28:29,003 --> 00:28:30,605
THAT'S RIGHT, USUALLY AT THIS

1029
00:28:30,605 --> 00:28:32,140
TIME OF YEAR.

1030
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,476
[laughter]

1031
00:28:34,476 --> 00:28:36,578
WELL, FIRST OFF, I HAVE A GIFT

1032
00:28:36,578 --> 00:28:37,545
FOR YOU, RED.

1033
00:28:37,545 --> 00:28:38,446
SURE.

1034
00:28:38,446 --> 00:28:39,647
IT'S A LITTLE SOMETHING I

1035
00:28:39,647 --> 00:28:40,648
CALL A CHRISTMAS CRACKER.

1036
00:28:40,648 --> 00:28:41,182
YEAH.

1037
00:28:41,182 --> 00:28:42,116
MY OWN IDEA.

1038
00:28:42,116 --> 00:28:42,917
OH...

1039
00:28:42,917 --> 00:28:43,918
NO, NO, NO.

1040
00:28:43,918 --> 00:28:45,486
EDGAR, NO OFFENSE, BUT, YOU

1041
00:28:45,486 --> 00:28:46,821
KNOW, LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE HAD

1042
00:28:46,821 --> 00:28:48,089
CRACKERS.

1043
00:28:48,089 --> 00:28:50,124
YES, BUT DO THEY USE THE

1044
00:28:50,124 --> 00:28:52,093
MERCURY DETONATOR?

1045
00:28:57,298 --> 00:28:58,499
NO, THAT'S--THAT'S ALL YOU.

1046
00:28:58,499 --> 00:29:01,002
YEAH, YEAH.

1047
00:29:01,002 --> 00:29:03,104
NOW, RED, I'M HERE BECAUSE MY

1048
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,173
SNOW CANNON ISN'T WORKING.

1049
00:29:05,173 --> 00:29:06,774
SNOW CANNON.

1050
00:29:06,774 --> 00:29:07,976
BOY, THAT SOUNDS CUTE.

1051
00:29:07,976 --> 00:29:08,810
HOW'S--HOW DOES THAT WORK?

1052
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:09,978
WELL, NORMALLY, WHEN YOU

1053
00:29:09,978 --> 00:29:12,313
PUSH DOWN HERE, IT SENDS SNOW

1054
00:29:12,313 --> 00:29:13,615
OUT IN SPRINKLES ACROSS THE

1055
00:29:13,615 --> 00:29:14,983
YARD.

1056
00:29:14,983 --> 00:29:15,516
[sharp whooshing]

1057
00:29:15,516 --> 00:29:18,052
OH!

1058
00:29:18,052 --> 00:29:19,354
WELL, GEE, THANKS, RED.

1059
00:29:19,354 --> 00:29:20,655
THAT'S A GOOD REPAIR.

1060
00:29:20,655 --> 00:29:22,290
WHAT DID YOU DO?

1061
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,224
I MADE A LITTLE ADJUSTMENT.

1062
00:29:23,224 --> 00:29:24,225
IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW.

1063
00:29:24,225 --> 00:29:25,627
OH.

1064
00:29:25,627 --> 00:29:27,061
WELL, BY GOLLY, IF THERE'S

1065
00:29:27,061 --> 00:29:29,130
ANYTHING I CAN DO TO RETURN THE

1066
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,164
FAVOR...

1067
00:29:30,164 --> 00:29:31,065
OH, AS A MATTER OF FACT,

1068
00:29:31,065 --> 00:29:31,899
YEAH, YOU COULD.

1069
00:29:31,899 --> 00:29:33,868
I GOT TO DECORATE THE TREE HERE.

1070
00:29:33,868 --> 00:29:34,969
I GOT TO DECORATE THE TREE.

1071
00:29:34,969 --> 00:29:35,970
AND THAT'S A LONG JOB.

1072
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:36,871
COULD YOU HELP ME OUT WITH THAT,

1073
00:29:36,871 --> 00:29:37,505
EDGAR?

1074
00:29:37,505 --> 00:29:38,706
WELL, YOU'RE IN LUCK, 'CAUSE

1075
00:29:38,706 --> 00:29:42,477
TODAY I GOT MY HOWITZER HOLIDAY

1076
00:29:42,477 --> 00:29:43,644
SPECIAL WITH ME.

1077
00:29:43,644 --> 00:29:44,879
HOWITZER HOLIDAY SPECIAL.

1078
00:29:44,879 --> 00:29:46,614
THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING.

1079
00:29:46,614 --> 00:29:48,850
BOY, THIS BABY CAN TINSEL A

1080
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,318
TREE FASTER THAN YOU CAN

1081
00:29:50,318 --> 00:29:51,652
CALL 911.

1082
00:29:51,652 --> 00:29:53,821
[laughter]

1083
00:29:53,821 --> 00:29:54,756
GREAT.

1084
00:29:54,756 --> 00:29:55,957
YOU JUST LOAD IT UP WITH SOME

1085
00:29:55,957 --> 00:29:59,260
TINFOIL...

1086
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,963
YOU TAKE AIM...

1087
00:30:01,963 --> 00:30:03,464
AND YOU FIRE...

1088
00:30:03,464 --> 00:30:05,533
boom!

1089
00:30:05,533 --> 00:30:08,503
[cheers and applause]

1090
00:30:17,945 --> 00:30:20,915
CHRISTMAS IS A YULE LOG.

1091
00:30:20,915 --> 00:30:22,416
WELL, IT USED TO BE, ANYWAY.

1092
00:30:22,416 --> 00:30:23,584
GUYS WOULD CHOP DOWN THE BIGGEST

1093
00:30:23,584 --> 00:30:24,886
TREE THEY COULD FIND, HAUL IT

1094
00:30:24,886 --> 00:30:26,220
HOME, AND BURN IT ALL THROUGH

1095
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,488
CHRISTMAS.

1096
00:30:27,488 --> 00:30:28,389
THAT WAS OKAY IF YOU HAD A

1097
00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:30,591
FIREPLACE THE SIZE OF A BUICK,

1098
00:30:30,591 --> 00:30:32,160
BUT A REAL SAFETY HAZARD IF YOU

1099
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,561
CONVERTED TO NATURAL GAS, I'LL

1100
00:30:33,561 --> 00:30:34,762
TELL YOU.

1101
00:30:34,762 --> 00:30:35,730
TODAY, OF COURSE, A YULE LOG IS

1102
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,198
AN ICE CREAM ROLL FILLED WITH

1103
00:30:37,198 --> 00:30:38,733
CANDIED FRUIT.

1104
00:30:38,733 --> 00:30:40,601
IF YOU TAP THAT SUCKER DOWN ON

1105
00:30:40,601 --> 00:30:41,969
TOP OF THE FIVE POUNDS OF

1106
00:30:41,969 --> 00:30:43,371
TURKEY, STUFFING, POTATOES, AND

1107
00:30:43,371 --> 00:30:44,972
GRAVY YOU ATE, THEN YOU'LL

1108
00:30:44,972 --> 00:30:46,007
DEFINITELY GET A BURN THAT'LL

1109
00:30:46,007 --> 00:30:47,608
LAST THROUGH CHRISTMAS.

1110
00:30:47,608 --> 00:30:48,676
PLUS, YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE A

1111
00:30:48,676 --> 00:30:49,944
CHOICE ABOUT CONVERTING TO

1112
00:30:49,944 --> 00:30:51,379
NATURAL GAS.

1113
00:30:51,379 --> 00:30:52,813
JUST DON'T STAND TOO CLOSE TO

1114
00:30:52,813 --> 00:30:56,984
THE FIREPLACE.

1115
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:01,155
OH, HELLO, BOYS AND GIRLS.

1116
00:31:01,155 --> 00:31:02,290
I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU,

1117
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,858
TODAY, A BRAND-NEW CHRISTMAS

1118
00:31:03,858 --> 00:31:04,892
TRADITION.

1119
00:31:04,892 --> 00:31:05,993
NOW, THIS IS AN ANCIENT

1120
00:31:05,993 --> 00:31:07,295
CHRISTMAS STORY THAT I WROTE

1121
00:31:07,295 --> 00:31:08,596
JUST A FEW DAYS AGO.

1122
00:31:08,596 --> 00:31:10,698
[laughter]

1123
00:31:10,698 --> 00:31:11,866
NOW, YOU'VE PROBABLY NEVER BEEN

1124
00:31:11,866 --> 00:31:13,301
TO A FIRE WATCHTOWER LIKE I'VE

1125
00:31:13,301 --> 00:31:15,169
BEEN FOR THE LAST 18 YEARS, SO

1126
00:31:15,169 --> 00:31:16,971
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO

1127
00:31:16,971 --> 00:31:18,372
WAKE UP CHRISTMAS MORNING,

1128
00:31:18,372 --> 00:31:20,341
ALONE, ALL EXCITED, AND THEN RUN

1129
00:31:20,341 --> 00:31:21,709
DOWNSTAIRS TO UNWRAP YOUR

1130
00:31:21,709 --> 00:31:24,412
LAUNDRY AND FIND OUT MOST OF

1131
00:31:24,412 --> 00:31:27,481
IT'S NOT FOR YOU.

1132
00:31:27,481 --> 00:31:29,684
YEAR AFTER YEAR...

1133
00:31:29,684 --> 00:31:33,988
ANYWAY, HERE'S THE STORY.

1134
00:31:33,988 --> 00:31:37,558
ARE YOU READY?

1135
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:40,127
ONCE UPON A TIME--WELL, ABOUT

1136
00:31:40,127 --> 00:31:42,630
246 DAYS AGO, REALLY--THERE

1137
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:45,099
WAS A TALL RODENT NAMED GORD

1138
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:46,400
WHO HAD A CHRISTMAS WISH NOT TO

1139
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,603
BE HIT BY LIGHTNING.

1140
00:31:49,603 --> 00:31:50,538
IT HAD HAPPENED SO MANY

1141
00:31:50,538 --> 00:31:52,840
CHRISTMASES BEFORE.

1142
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,208
GORD WOULD BE CELEBRATING

1143
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:55,976
CHRISTMAS AND WOULD BE RIGHT IN

1144
00:31:55,976 --> 00:31:57,344
THE MIDDLE OF A SECOND VERSE OF

1145
00:31:57,344 --> 00:31:58,879
JINGLE BELL ROCK,

1146
00:31:58,879 --> 00:32:00,815
WHEN--ZING--LIKE A LIGHTNING

1147
00:32:00,815 --> 00:32:06,153
BOLT, CAME A LIGHTNING BOLT.

1148
00:32:06,153 --> 00:32:08,189
IT DIDN'T STAY LONG, BUT IT

1149
00:32:08,189 --> 00:32:10,958
ALWAYS RUINED HIS CHRISTMAS.

1150
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:12,560
IT SINGED GORD'S EYELASHES AND

1151
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,928
FORCED HIM TO SPEND BOXING DAY

1152
00:32:13,928 --> 00:32:17,031
WITH THE SMELL OF BURNT HAIR.

1153
00:32:17,031 --> 00:32:18,766
HOW GORD PRAYED THIS YEAR WOULD

1154
00:32:18,766 --> 00:32:19,967
BE DIFFERENT.

1155
00:32:19,967 --> 00:32:21,869
DAY IN AND DAY OUT, THIS SLENDER

1156
00:32:21,869 --> 00:32:23,604
AND IN MANY WAYS ATTRACTIVE

1157
00:32:23,604 --> 00:32:27,241
RODENT, GORD...

1158
00:32:32,346 --> 00:32:33,447
WOULD STAND ATOP HIS TOWER

1159
00:32:33,447 --> 00:32:35,115
EATING NOTHING BUT CANNED CREAM

1160
00:32:35,115 --> 00:32:37,418
CORN AND SLOW-MOVING INSECTS

1161
00:32:37,418 --> 00:32:38,786
AS HE WAITED FOR CHRISTMAS TO

1162
00:32:38,786 --> 00:32:39,954
ARRIVE.

1163
00:32:39,954 --> 00:32:41,455
FINALLY, RIGHT AFTER CHRISTMAS

1164
00:32:41,455 --> 00:32:44,858
EVE, IT ARRIVED.

1165
00:32:44,858 --> 00:32:46,427
THE WIND CAME UP, AND THE STORM

1166
00:32:46,427 --> 00:32:48,095
BEGAN.

1167
00:32:48,095 --> 00:32:49,396
BUT THIS TIME, LITTLE GORD WAS

1168
00:32:49,396 --> 00:32:50,864
NOT HIT BY LIGHTNING.

1169
00:32:50,864 --> 00:32:52,499
INSTEAD, HE WAS HIT BY HIS OWN

1170
00:32:52,499 --> 00:32:54,335
TOWER.

1171
00:32:54,335 --> 00:32:55,903
LIKE SO MANY OF US, HE WAS

1172
00:32:55,903 --> 00:32:59,440
DOWNSIZED.

1173
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,609
HEAD FIRST TOO.

1174
00:33:01,609 --> 00:33:04,411
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

1175
00:33:04,411 --> 00:33:05,813
[applause]

1176
00:33:05,813 --> 00:33:07,681
[together] I LOVE

EVERY YEAR WE HEAR ABOUT HOW

1189
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,001
CHRISTMAS HAS BECOME TOO

1190
00:33:28,001 --> 00:33:29,236
COMMERCIAL AND THAT WE HAVE

1191
00:33:29,236 --> 00:33:31,105
LOST SIGHT OF ITS TRUE MEANING.

1192
00:33:31,105 --> 00:33:32,139
COULD YOU TELL ME THE BEST WAY

1193
00:33:32,139 --> 00:33:33,273
TO CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS IN ORDER

1194
00:33:33,273 --> 00:33:34,341
TO REMAIN TRUE TO WHAT IT'S

1195
00:33:34,341 --> 00:33:36,110
REALLY ALL ABOUT?

1196
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,478
SIGNED, BEWILDERED."

1197
00:33:37,478 --> 00:33:38,645
THIS ONE'S MINE.

1198
00:33:38,645 --> 00:33:39,947
SORRY TO JUMP IN THERE, BUT THIS

1199
00:33:39,947 --> 00:33:41,115
IS SOMETHING THAT I'M ACTUALLY

1200
00:33:41,115 --> 00:33:42,015
QUALIFIED TO OFFER

1201
00:33:42,015 --> 00:33:43,684
AN OPINION ON.

1202
00:33:43,684 --> 00:33:44,752
WELL, BOY, HERE'S A FIRST.

1203
00:33:44,752 --> 00:33:46,754
YEAH, YOU HATE CHRISTMAS,

1204
00:33:46,754 --> 00:33:47,654
MR. HUMPHREY.

1205
00:33:47,654 --> 00:33:48,689
WHAT MAKES YOU AN EXPERT?

1206
00:33:48,689 --> 00:33:49,656
WELL, HAROLD, YOU KNOW, EVERY

1207
00:33:49,656 --> 00:33:50,591
YEAR, I TRY AND COME UP WITH AN

1208
00:33:50,591 --> 00:33:51,892
EXCUSE TO AVOID CELEBRATING THE

1209
00:33:51,892 --> 00:33:53,260
DARN THING, YOU KNOW.

1210
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,194
AND I'VE LEARNED AN AWFUL LOT

1211
00:33:54,194 --> 00:33:55,028
ABOUT THE TRADITIONS.

1212
00:33:55,028 --> 00:33:56,196
MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE, YOU KNOW.

1213
00:33:56,196 --> 00:33:57,197
AND I'M TELL YOU, SOME OF THE

1214
00:33:57,197 --> 00:33:58,866
TRUTHS BEHIND THE THINGS WE DO

1215
00:33:58,866 --> 00:34:00,667
TO CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS--THAT

1216
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:02,836
WOULD CURL YOUR HAIR, RED.

1217
00:34:02,836 --> 00:34:04,671
WHEREVER THAT IS, NOW.

1218
00:34:04,671 --> 00:34:09,276
HEY, HEY, HEY.

1219
00:34:09,276 --> 00:34:10,277
SO YOU'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH ALL

1220
00:34:10,277 --> 00:34:11,845
THE TRADITIONS OF CHRISTMAS AND

1221
00:34:11,845 --> 00:34:12,946
LOOKING FOR A LOOPHOLE, EH,

1222
00:34:12,946 --> 00:34:13,714
DALTON?

1223
00:34:13,714 --> 00:34:14,681
OH YEAH, YEP, YEP.

1224
00:34:14,681 --> 00:34:15,616
WELL, NOW, TAKE YOUR TREE, FOR

1225
00:34:15,616 --> 00:34:16,650
INSTANCE.

1226
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:17,985
WE WILL HAVE NO TREE IN OUR

1227
00:34:17,985 --> 00:34:19,086
HOUSE THIS YEAR.

1228
00:34:19,086 --> 00:34:19,586
WOW.

1229
00:34:19,586 --> 00:34:20,420
AND I'VE GOT A GOOD REASON

1230
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,021
FOR IT.

1231
00:34:21,021 --> 00:34:22,022
YEAH, IT'S THE SHEER WASTE OF

1232
00:34:22,022 --> 00:34:23,023
TREES AND THE LAND THEY'RE

1233
00:34:23,023 --> 00:34:23,957
GROWING ON, HUH?

1234
00:34:23,957 --> 00:34:25,459
OH, WORSE THAN THAT, HAROLD.

1235
00:34:25,459 --> 00:34:26,460
YOU KNOW, THE TRADITION OF

1236
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,794
DECORATING THE PINE TREE DIDN'T

1237
00:34:27,794 --> 00:34:29,296
START IN THE BIBLE, MY NAIVE,

1238
00:34:29,296 --> 00:34:30,464
YOUNG FRIEND.

1239
00:34:30,464 --> 00:34:31,498
NO, NO.

1240
00:34:31,498 --> 00:34:33,967
IT WAS WITH THE ANCIENT DRUIDS.

1241
00:34:33,967 --> 00:34:35,402
YES.

1242
00:34:35,402 --> 00:34:36,470
THOSE EGG-TOTING,

1243
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:38,238
STONEHENGE-BUILDING,

1244
00:34:38,238 --> 00:34:40,374
TREE-WORSHIPPING PAGANS!

1245
00:34:40,374 --> 00:34:42,676
WELL...

1246
00:34:42,676 --> 00:34:43,810
SO NO TREE?

1247
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:44,511
NO.

1248
00:34:44,511 --> 00:34:45,012
ALL RIGHT.

1249
00:34:45,012 --> 00:34:46,546
THERE WAS NO SCOTCH PINE.

1250
00:34:46,546 --> 00:34:48,548
THERE WAS NO EXTRUDED ALUMINUM

1251
00:34:48,548 --> 00:34:50,717
TREE AT THE MANGER...

1252
00:34:50,717 --> 00:34:51,752
AT LEAST IN MY HOLIDAY INN

1253
00:34:51,752 --> 00:34:52,786
GIDEON.

1254
00:34:52,786 --> 00:34:55,889
WASN'T IN THERE.

1255
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:57,491
SO HOW'S THIS WHOLE THEORY

1256
00:34:57,491 --> 00:34:58,525
SITTING WITH THE REST OF THE

1257
00:34:58,525 --> 00:34:59,559
HUMPHREY CLAN?

1258
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:00,794
WELL, NOW, I'M EXPECTING

1259
00:35:00,794 --> 00:35:02,062
THERE'S GONNA BE SOME MINOR

1260
00:35:02,062 --> 00:35:03,864
RESISTANCE TO OVERCOME.

1261
00:35:03,864 --> 00:35:04,665
BUT, YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE THAT

1262
00:35:04,665 --> 00:35:06,099
COMMON SENSE WILL PREVAIL WHEN

1263
00:35:06,099 --> 00:35:07,701
I EXPLAIN TO THEM THAT I'M JUST

1264
00:35:07,701 --> 00:35:08,835
TRYING TO PROTECT THEM FROM

1265
00:35:08,835 --> 00:35:10,937
PARTICIPATING IN PRE-CHRISTIAN

1266
00:35:10,937 --> 00:35:12,606
VOODOO.

1267
00:35:12,606 --> 00:35:13,874
THERE'LL BE NO PAGAN RITUALS AT

1268
00:35:13,874 --> 00:35:16,410
OUR HOUSE, YOU KNOW.

1269
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:17,477
THERE'LL BE NO LITTLE RED FAT

1270
00:35:17,477 --> 00:35:19,112
MAN IN A SUIT.

1271
00:35:19,112 --> 00:35:21,081
THERE'LL BE NO MUTANT REINDEERS

1272
00:35:21,081 --> 00:35:25,385
WITH RADIOACTIVE NOSES.

1273
00:35:25,385 --> 00:35:26,486
YOU KNOW, THOSE PEOPLE DIDN'T

1274
00:35:26,486 --> 00:35:27,621
HAVE STOCKINGS.

1275
00:35:27,621 --> 00:35:30,557
WE DON'T NEED STOCKING STUFFERS.

1276
00:35:30,557 --> 00:35:31,591
YOU KNOW, DALTON, I'M NOT A

1277
00:35:31,591 --> 00:35:32,626
PSYCHIATRIST, BUT I THINK YOU

1278
00:35:32,626 --> 00:35:34,194
FINALLY HAVE ALL FOUR WHEELS OFF

1279
00:35:34,194 --> 00:35:37,664
THE ROAD.

1280
00:35:37,664 --> 00:35:39,599
NO, NO, NO, NOW, LISTEN TO

1281
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,501
THIS, RED.

1282
00:35:41,501 --> 00:35:42,469
DID YOU KNOW THAT THE TRADITION

1283
00:35:42,469 --> 00:35:43,970
OF HANGING MISTLETOE GOES BACK

1284
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:47,007
TO THE ANCIENT DRUIDS TOO?

1285
00:35:47,007 --> 00:35:48,475
ARE YOU SURE, MR. HUMPHREY?

1286
00:35:48,475 --> 00:35:49,843
AS SURE AS I AM THAT GREAT

1287
00:35:49,843 --> 00:35:51,378
MUSIC STARTS FAST AND SLOWS

1288
00:35:51,378 --> 00:35:54,414
DOWN, THEN SPEEDS UP AGAIN.

1289
00:35:56,883 --> 00:35:58,752
THAT'S RIGHT.

1290
00:35:58,752 --> 00:36:00,754
WE WILL BE CELEBRATING THE TRUE

1291
00:36:00,754 --> 00:36:02,355
ELEMENTS OF THE ORIGINAL

1292
00:36:02,355 --> 00:36:05,125
CHRISTMAS IN OUR HOUSE:

1293
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:06,159
BIG TURKEY DINNER WITH ALL THE

1294
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:08,662
TRIMMINGS, AND THAT'S IT.

1295
00:36:08,662 --> 00:36:09,563
WELL, YOU MIGHT WANT TO KEEP

1296
00:36:09,563 --> 00:36:10,931
SOME OF THAT MISTLETOE AROUND.

1297
00:36:10,931 --> 00:36:11,765
IF YOU'RE NOT CELEBRATING OR

1298
00:36:11,765 --> 00:36:12,666
BUYING ANYBODY GIFTS, YOU CAN

1299
00:36:12,666 --> 00:36:14,100
KISS YOUR MARRIAGE GOOD-BYE.

1300
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:18,238
[cheers and applause]

1301
00:36:21,608 --> 00:36:24,611
CHRISTMAS IS NO SURPRISES.

1302
00:36:24,611 --> 00:36:25,779
YOU KNOW THE TOYS WILL BE OPEN

1303
00:36:25,779 --> 00:36:27,981
BY 7:00, CAUSING FIGHTS BY 9:00,

1304
00:36:27,981 --> 00:36:29,616
AND BROKEN BY 10:00.

1305
00:36:29,616 --> 00:36:31,117
YOU KNOW THE KIDS WILL BE CRANKY

1306
00:36:31,117 --> 00:36:32,786
BY NOON, THE IN-LAWS WILL ARRIVE

1307
00:36:32,786 --> 00:36:34,821
BY 2:00, AND YOU'LL BE HIDING IN

1308
00:36:34,821 --> 00:36:37,123
THE BASEMENT BY 2:30.

1309
00:36:37,123 --> 00:36:38,858
YOU KNOW YOU'LL GET 15 MINUTES

1310
00:36:38,858 --> 00:36:40,226
OF PEACE ON EARTH BEFORE YOUR

1311
00:36:40,226 --> 00:36:41,828
BROTHER-IN-LAW FINDS YOU SULKING

1312
00:36:41,828 --> 00:36:44,064
BEHIND THE FURNACE.

1313
00:36:44,064 --> 00:36:45,165
YOU KNOW YOU'LL HAVE DINNER AT

1314
00:36:45,165 --> 00:36:47,033
4:00 PM, WHEN NO ONE'S HUNGRY,

1315
00:36:47,033 --> 00:36:48,635
BUT THEY'LL ALL STILL EAT LIKE A

1316
00:36:48,635 --> 00:36:51,137
CHAIN GANG ON A DAY PASS.

1317
00:36:51,137 --> 00:36:52,572
AND YOU KNOW BY 10:00, YOU'LL BE

1318
00:36:52,572 --> 00:36:54,107
REEKING OF CHRISTMAS CHEER,

1319
00:36:54,107 --> 00:36:55,742
SHOUTING AT THE COPS AS YOU TRY

1320
00:36:55,742 --> 00:36:57,277
TO EXPLAIN THE GUNSHOT HOLES IN

1321
00:36:57,277 --> 00:37:00,814
YOUR NEIGHBOR'S LAWN ORNAMENTS.

1322
00:37:02,115 --> 00:37:03,249
WINSTON ROTHSCHILD HERE,

1323
00:37:03,249 --> 00:37:04,484
FROM ROTHSCHILD SEWAGE AND

1324
00:37:04,484 --> 00:37:07,620
SEPTIC-SUCKING SERVICES, WHERE

1325
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,122
OUR NEW MOTTO IS, "WHATEVER YOU

1326
00:37:09,122 --> 00:37:13,293
CALL IT, I'LL UP AND HAUL IT."

1327
00:37:13,293 --> 00:37:14,761
YEAH, THAT OFFICIALLY REPLACES

1328
00:37:14,761 --> 00:37:16,596
OUR OLD MOTTO: "WE DO IT ALL

1329
00:37:16,596 --> 00:37:19,699
SO YOU CAN TOO."

1330
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:20,800
YOU KNOW, WITH THE HOLIDAYS UPON

1331
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,336
US, I'D JUST LIKE TO TAKE SOME

1332
00:37:23,336 --> 00:37:24,738
TIME TO REMIND YOU THAT THE GIFT

1333
00:37:24,738 --> 00:37:27,807
YOU GIVE A KID IS SO IMPORTANT.

1334
00:37:27,807 --> 00:37:29,242
IT'S ALMOST AS IMPORTANT AS THE

1335
00:37:29,242 --> 00:37:32,011
STUFF OTHER PEOPLE GIVE YOU.

1336
00:37:32,011 --> 00:37:33,179
YOU KNOW, I'LL NEVER FORGET WHEN

1337
00:37:33,179 --> 00:37:35,115
I WAS SEVEN AT CHRISTMASTIME.

1338
00:37:35,115 --> 00:37:38,218
I GOT THREE GIFTS: A TOY RATTLE,

1339
00:37:38,218 --> 00:37:42,088
A TOY CAR, AND A SHOVEL.

1340
00:37:42,088 --> 00:37:44,090
NOW, THE RATTLE WAS GIVEN TO ME

1341
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,959
BY MY AUNT DEIRDRE.

1342
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:47,393
YOU KNOW, I'LL NEVER REALLY

1343
00:37:47,393 --> 00:37:49,128
UNDERSTAND WHAT A PERSON IS

1344
00:37:49,128 --> 00:37:51,197
DOING GIVING A RATTLE TO A

1345
00:37:51,197 --> 00:37:52,599
SEVEN-YEAR-OLD.

1346
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:53,533
YOU KNOW, I KNOW I WAS SHORT FOR

1347
00:37:53,533 --> 00:37:55,034
MY AGE, BUT, I MEAN, JEEZ, I

1348
00:37:55,034 --> 00:37:56,102
HAD A FULL RACK OF TEETH AND I

1349
00:37:56,102 --> 00:37:57,003
COULD BELCH LOUDER

1350
00:37:57,003 --> 00:38:00,206
THAN MY DAD, EH?

1351
00:38:00,206 --> 00:38:01,407
BUT IN FAIRNESS TO DEIRDRE,

1352
00:38:01,407 --> 00:38:02,575
I MEAN, I DON'T THINK SHE REALLY

1353
00:38:02,575 --> 00:38:04,177
KNEW HOW OLD I WAS ANYWAY.

1354
00:38:04,177 --> 00:38:05,078
I KNOW SHE LIVED WAY OUT OF

1355
00:38:05,078 --> 00:38:06,446
TOWN, AND SHE WAS ON THIS

1356
00:38:06,446 --> 00:38:07,747
SPECIAL MEDICATION THAT SHE'D

1357
00:38:07,747 --> 00:38:10,516
MAKE FROM POTATOES.

1358
00:38:10,516 --> 00:38:11,885
WEIRD.

1359
00:38:11,885 --> 00:38:13,519
NOW, THE TOY CAR WAS GIVEN TO

1360
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:15,622
ME BY MY FRIEND NEXT DOOR, EH?

1361
00:38:15,622 --> 00:38:17,023
AND I REALLY LIKED IT AT FIRST,

1362
00:38:17,023 --> 00:38:19,058
BUT AFTER A MONTH OR SO, I JUST

1363
00:38:19,058 --> 00:38:20,460
KIND OF STOPPED PLAYING WITH IT

1364
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,728
AND DECIDED TO GO BACK TO

1365
00:38:21,728 --> 00:38:24,297
SCHOOL.

1366
00:38:24,297 --> 00:38:26,699
THE BEST GIFT OF ALL WAS THIS

1367
00:38:26,699 --> 00:38:28,835
SHOVEL MY PARENTS GAVE ME.

1368
00:38:28,835 --> 00:38:31,571
YEAH, I USED TO DIG AND DIG FOR

1369
00:38:31,571 --> 00:38:34,240
HOURS WITH THIS SHOVEL, UNTIL

1370
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,441
FINALLY THEY KICKED ME OUT TO

1371
00:38:35,441 --> 00:38:38,411
THE BACKYARD, EH?

1372
00:38:38,411 --> 00:38:39,946
AND THAT'S WHERE I FOUND OUT

1373
00:38:39,946 --> 00:38:42,115
WHAT A SEPTIC SYSTEM'S ALL

1374
00:38:42,115 --> 00:38:44,817
ABOUT, EH?

1375
00:38:44,817 --> 00:38:46,219
AND WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR DOG,

1376
00:38:46,219 --> 00:38:47,320
LUCKY.

1377
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,190
[laughter]

1378
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,425
ANYWAY, I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING

1379
00:38:52,425 --> 00:38:54,293
IS, WHEN YOU'RE GETTING A GIFT

1380
00:38:54,293 --> 00:38:56,396
FOR A KID, DON'T GET HIM

1381
00:38:56,396 --> 00:38:57,930
SOMETHING THAT SUITED HIM

1382
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:58,931
YESTERDAY.

1383
00:38:58,931 --> 00:38:59,866
DON'T EVEN GET HIM SOMETHING

1384
00:38:59,866 --> 00:39:01,067
THAT WILL SUIT HIM TODAY.

1385
00:39:01,067 --> 00:39:02,301
GET HIM SOMETHING THAT'LL SUIT

1386
00:39:02,301 --> 00:39:05,171
HIM FOR TOMORROW.

1387
00:39:05,171 --> 00:39:06,606
THANKS, DAD.

1388
00:39:06,606 --> 00:39:07,640
'CAUSE YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

1389
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,176
EVERY TIME I HEAR THAT FINAL--

1390
00:39:10,176 --> 00:39:11,310
[slurps loudly]

1391
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,279
WHEN I'M PUMPING OUT A TANK, I

1392
00:39:13,279 --> 00:39:15,248
THINK OF YOU.

1393
00:39:15,248 --> 00:39:18,451
[laughter and applause]

1394
00:39:18,985 --> 00:39:20,953
[together] I LOVE

1395
00:39:20,953 --> 00:39:22,622
CHRISTMAS

1396
00:39:22,622 --> 00:39:23,523
ONE OLD LADY HAD A MOUTH

1397
00:39:23,523 --> 00:39:24,924
DRAWN UP LIKE A BOW, AND THE

1398
00:39:24,924 --> 00:39:26,159
HAIR ON HER MOLE WAS AS WHITE AS

1399
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:28,528
THE SNOW.

1400
00:39:28,528 --> 00:39:29,762
ANOTHER WAS HAMMERED, A RIGHT

1401
00:39:29,762 --> 00:39:31,063
JOLLY OLD ELF, AND I LAUGHED

1402
00:39:31,063 --> 00:39:32,231
WHEN SHE BELCHED, IN SPITE OF

1403
00:39:32,231 --> 00:39:34,300
MYSELF.

1404
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,301
THEY SPOKE A FEW WORDS AND WENT

1405
00:39:35,301 --> 00:39:36,269
STRAIGHT TO THE KITCHEN, WHILE

1406
00:39:36,269 --> 00:39:37,370
THE GUYS STARTED WAKING UP,

1407
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:39,739
SCRATCHING AND ITCHING.

1408
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:40,573
THEY BROUGHT TURKEY AND

1409
00:39:40,573 --> 00:39:42,141
SAUSAGES, KIPPERS AND TROUT.

1410
00:39:42,141 --> 00:39:43,075
THEY SAID, "HAVE FUN BOYS

1411
00:39:43,075 --> 00:39:44,343
'CAUSE TONIGHT, IT'S LADIES

1412
00:39:44,343 --> 00:39:45,978
NIGHT OUT."

1413
00:39:45,978 --> 00:39:46,846
THEY SPRANG TO THE MAGIC

1414
00:39:46,846 --> 00:39:50,983
WAGON TILL THE HORN GAVE A HONK.

1415
00:39:50,983 --> 00:39:52,318
AND AWAY THEY PUTT-PUTTERED

1416
00:39:52,318 --> 00:39:54,687
TO GO OUT AND GET STONKED.

1417
00:39:54,687 --> 00:39:55,588
AND I HEARD THEM EXCLAIM AS

1418
00:39:55,588 --> 00:39:56,522
THEY DROVE OUT OF SIGHT,

1419
00:39:56,522 --> 00:39:58,357
"HAPPY CHRISTMAS TO ALL--

1420
00:39:58,357 --> 00:39:59,525
[together] BE HOME EARLY

1421
00:39:59,525 --> 00:40:00,726
TONIGHT."

1422
00:40:00,726 --> 00:40:04,230
[cheers and applause]

1423
00:40:09,335 --> 00:40:10,169
SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT

1424
00:40:10,169 --> 00:40:11,604
SPECIAL FOR THIS SHOW--A

1425
00:40:11,604 --> 00:40:13,039
CHRISTMAS ADVENTURE WITH--OH,

1426
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:14,073
YEAH, BILL, HOW ARE YOU DOING?

1427
00:40:14,073 --> 00:40:15,942
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM, HUH?

1428
00:40:15,942 --> 00:40:18,311
OH, HE'S GOT THE--GOT THE CAR

1429
00:40:18,311 --> 00:40:20,179
PARKED ON THE SNOW SHOE.

1430
00:40:20,179 --> 00:40:21,047
WHY DON'T YOU JUST MOVE THE CAR,

1431
00:40:21,047 --> 00:40:21,781
BILL?

1432
00:40:21,781 --> 00:40:25,384
I'LL MOVE THE CAR.

1433
00:40:25,384 --> 00:40:26,719
NOW, DON'T--DON'T LIFT THAT.

1434
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:27,320
NO, LET'S MOVE IT.

1435
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:27,887
THAT'S EASY.

1436
00:40:27,887 --> 00:40:29,755
LET'S JUST MOVE IT.

1437
00:40:29,755 --> 00:40:30,856
BILL ALWAYS WANTS TO DO THINGS

1438
00:40:30,856 --> 00:40:34,060
THE HARD WAY.

1439
00:40:37,296 --> 00:40:39,799
YEAH--YEAH, THAT'S GOOD, BILL.

1440
00:40:39,799 --> 00:40:43,336
AH, OH.

1441
00:40:43,336 --> 00:40:44,603
ALL RIGHT, WHAT WE'RE OUT TO DO

1442
00:40:44,603 --> 00:40:46,138
ACTUALLY IS TO GET OURSELVES A

1443
00:40:46,138 --> 00:40:47,139
CHRISTMAS TREE.

1444
00:40:47,139 --> 00:40:48,174
SO A BIG ONE, A BIG TREE FOR THE

1445
00:40:48,174 --> 00:40:49,342
LODGE THERE.

1446
00:40:49,342 --> 00:40:51,344
THESE TREES ARE--OH.

1447
00:40:51,344 --> 00:40:52,178
THERE, THEN, THAT'S WHAT THE

1448
00:40:52,178 --> 00:40:53,446
TOBOGGAN'S ALL ABOUT.

1449
00:40:53,446 --> 00:40:54,613
WE'RE GONNA HAUL HER HOME THERE,

1450
00:40:54,613 --> 00:40:55,981
AND--OH, NO, BILL THAT

1451
00:40:55,981 --> 00:40:57,183
ONE--NO, THAT'S TOO--BILL,

1452
00:40:57,183 --> 00:40:58,117
THAT'S TOO BIG.

1453
00:40:58,117 --> 00:40:59,251
THAT'S TOO BIG.

1454
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:00,186
YOU'LL NEVER GET THAT TREE

1455
00:41:00,186 --> 00:41:01,387
STANDING UP IN THE LODGE.

1456
00:41:01,387 --> 00:41:03,889
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE--OH.

1457
00:41:03,889 --> 00:41:04,657
ALL RIGHT, THERE, BILL.

1458
00:41:04,657 --> 00:41:09,095
LET'S--A LITTLE BIT--OH.

1459
00:41:09,095 --> 00:41:10,296
THIS IS GONNA BE A LONG DAY, I

1460
00:41:10,296 --> 00:41:11,564
THINK.

1461
00:41:11,564 --> 00:41:13,399
WHAT'S HE GOT?

1462
00:41:13,399 --> 00:41:15,434
OH, HE'S GOT AN AXE IN HIS

1463
00:41:15,434 --> 00:41:16,869
PANTS...

1464
00:41:16,869 --> 00:41:17,736
WHICH I GUESS IS BETTER THAN

1465
00:41:17,736 --> 00:41:18,537
HAVING AN ACCIDENT IN YOUR

1466
00:41:18,537 --> 00:41:20,106
PANTS.

1467
00:41:20,106 --> 00:41:23,242
HE'S GOT TWO--OH, MY GOLLY,

1468
00:41:23,242 --> 00:41:25,344
THAT'S NOT...

1469
00:41:25,344 --> 00:41:27,580
SIZE MATTERS, RIGHT, BILL?

1470
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,448
UH-OH, UH-OH, UH-OH.

1471
00:41:29,448 --> 00:41:30,816
BILL, DON'T--OH, GEE, THE AXE

1472
00:41:30,816 --> 00:41:34,019
IS--THE AXE IS INCOMING.

1473
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:36,522
MY GOSH.

1474
00:41:36,522 --> 00:41:38,491
YOU KNOW, THAT COULD HAVE HURT.

1475
00:41:38,491 --> 00:41:41,227
SO, BILL, YOU ALMOST KILLED ME,

1476
00:41:41,227 --> 00:41:44,129
JUST THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

1477
00:41:44,129 --> 00:41:45,497
I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY.

1478
00:41:45,497 --> 00:41:46,599
OH, HE'S GOT AN IDEA,

1479
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:47,399
AND SO DO I.

1480
00:41:47,399 --> 00:41:48,734
NO, NO, CAN'T DO THAT IN FRONT

1481
00:41:48,734 --> 00:41:50,836
OF THE CAMERAS.

1482
00:41:50,836 --> 00:41:52,471
AND JACK CLIMBED AND CLIMBED

1483
00:41:52,471 --> 00:41:53,873
WHILE HIS MOTHER WONDERED WHAT

1484
00:41:53,873 --> 00:41:56,308
HE HAD DONE WITH THE MONEY.

1485
00:41:56,308 --> 00:41:59,411
UP HE GOES TO SEE THE GIANT.

1486
00:41:59,411 --> 00:42:01,146
NO, THAT'S ANOTHER ADVENTURE.

1487
00:42:01,146 --> 00:42:02,281
THERE YOU GO, BILL.

1488
00:42:02,281 --> 00:42:03,682
RIGHT UP TO THE TOP THERE.

1489
00:42:03,682 --> 00:42:04,717
TRUNKS GETTING A LITTLE THIN AT

1490
00:42:04,717 --> 00:42:05,618
THIS POINT.

1491
00:42:05,618 --> 00:42:07,119
AND BILL CERTAINLY ISN'T.

1492
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:07,920
THERE YOU GO.

1493
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,687
PULL YOUR WAY UP THERE.

1494
00:42:08,687 --> 00:42:09,188
HANG ON.

1495
00:42:09,188 --> 00:42:09,688
HANG ON.

1496
00:42:09,688 --> 00:42:10,990
HANG ON.

1497
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,057
YEAH, NOW, JUST ROCK IT, ROCK

1498
00:42:12,057 --> 00:42:12,758
IT.

1499
00:42:12,758 --> 00:42:13,592
MAYBE YOU'LL SNAP IT OFF AT THE

1500
00:42:13,592 --> 00:42:14,793
TRUNK OR SOMETHING, BILL.

1501
00:42:14,793 --> 00:42:18,530
OR JUST--JUST TAKE--OH, I SEE.

1502
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,598
LOOK AT THIS KIDS, EH?

1503
00:42:19,598 --> 00:42:20,633
SEE HOW YOU CAN USE YOUR

1504
00:42:20,633 --> 00:42:22,835
BALANCE TO--MOVING THE WEIGHT

1505
00:42:22,835 --> 00:42:24,670
AND KEEPING THE TREE IN...

1506
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:25,738
I DON'T THINK BILL IS ACTUALLY

1507
00:42:25,738 --> 00:42:27,406
ALL THAT BALANCED, NO MATTER

1508
00:42:27,406 --> 00:42:29,842
WHAT WE DO--OH.

1509
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:31,410
OH, MY GOLLY.

1510
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:32,511
HOLY SMOKE.

1511
00:42:32,511 --> 00:42:33,178
THE TREE CURLED RIGHT

1512
00:42:33,178 --> 00:42:34,246
AROUND--WHOOPS--RIGHT DOWN

1513
00:42:34,246 --> 00:42:38,150
THERE.

1514
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:40,085
OH, THERE'S YOUR--THERE'S YOUR

1515
00:42:40,085 --> 00:42:41,353
TREE.

1516
00:42:41,353 --> 00:42:42,121
THAT WON'T TAKE LONG TO

1517
00:42:42,121 --> 00:42:44,590
DECORATE.

1518
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:46,492
YEAH, BILL.

1519
00:42:46,492 --> 00:42:47,793
HAVE YOURSELF A GREAT CHRISTMAS.

1520
00:42:47,793 --> 00:42:51,563
BYE-BYE.

1521
00:42:51,563 --> 00:42:53,699
[applause]

1522
00:42:55,334 --> 00:42:59,238
[paper rustling]

1523
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,976
OH...

1524
00:43:03,976 --> 00:43:07,546
OKAY, YEAH.

1525
00:43:07,546 --> 00:43:09,882
I...

1526
00:43:09,882 --> 00:43:13,285
I...

1527
00:43:13,285 --> 00:43:14,653
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU PARENTS

1528
00:43:14,653 --> 00:43:19,792
ABOUT CHRISTMAS.

1529
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:21,360
THE KIDS REALLY LOOK UP TO YOU

1530
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,661
TO MAKE CHRISTMAS A SPECIAL

1531
00:43:22,661 --> 00:43:23,862
TIME.

1532
00:43:23,862 --> 00:43:26,398
AND I MEAN THAT IN A GOOD WAY.

1533
00:43:26,398 --> 00:43:27,799
CHRISTMAS CAN BE UPSETTING TO

1534
00:43:27,799 --> 00:43:29,601
THE KIDS.

1535
00:43:29,601 --> 00:43:30,802
FOR EXAMPLE, YOU DADS OUT THERE,

1536
00:43:30,802 --> 00:43:32,037
DON'T COME HOME ON CHRISTMAS

1537
00:43:32,037 --> 00:43:33,906
EVE IN THE BACK OF A SQUAD CAR.

1538
00:43:33,906 --> 00:43:37,075
[laughter]

1539
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:39,211
CHRISTMAS IS A TIME OF FAMILY

1540
00:43:39,211 --> 00:43:40,712
AND LOVE.

1541
00:43:40,712 --> 00:43:41,880
I MEAN, IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD

1542
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,248
PRESENTS FOR THE KIDS, THEY'LL

1543
00:43:43,248 --> 00:43:44,182
UNDERSTAND.

1544
00:43:44,182 --> 00:43:45,317
DON'T GO OUT IN THE GARAGE AND

1545
00:43:45,317 --> 00:43:47,152
FIRE OFF A SHOTGUN AND THEN TRY

1546
00:43:47,152 --> 00:43:48,420
TO CONVINCE THE KIDS THAT SANTA

1547
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:52,391
COMMITTED SUICIDE.

1548
00:43:52,391 --> 00:43:53,692
AND DON'T GIVE THEM A BIKE YOU

1549
00:43:53,692 --> 00:43:54,927
STOLE FROM THE KID ACROSS THE

1550
00:43:54,927 --> 00:43:56,695
STREET.

1551
00:43:56,695 --> 00:43:58,096
YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO JUST BE

1552
00:43:58,096 --> 00:43:59,331
TOGETHER AT CHRISTMAS AND TRY

1553
00:43:59,331 --> 00:44:00,399
NOT TO GET ON EACH OTHER'S

1554
00:44:00,399 --> 00:44:01,433
NERVES.

1555
00:44:01,433 --> 00:44:03,035
MAYBE AVOID SENSITIVE TOPICS

1556
00:44:03,035 --> 00:44:05,103
LIKE POLITICS AND RELIGION AND

1557
00:44:05,103 --> 00:44:07,706
WHO OWES WHO MONEY.

1558
00:44:07,706 --> 00:44:08,907
AND EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT HAVING A

1559
00:44:08,907 --> 00:44:10,309
FANCY CHRISTMAS DINNER, YOU CAN

1560
00:44:10,309 --> 00:44:11,410
AT LEAST TAKE THE PIZZA OUT OF

1561
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:13,545
THE BOX.

1562
00:44:13,545 --> 00:44:15,280
AND DRESS UP FESTIVE.

1563
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,549
MAYBE PUT A SHIRT ON.

1564
00:44:17,549 --> 00:44:20,085
AND PUT SOME PANTS ON.

1565
00:44:20,085 --> 00:44:21,653
YOU KNOW, THAT'S A GIFT THAT

1566
00:44:21,653 --> 00:44:24,122
KEEPS ON GIVING.

1567
00:44:24,122 --> 00:44:25,524
YOU GOT TO TAKE THIS SPECIAL DAY

1568
00:44:25,524 --> 00:44:27,492
TO BE WITH YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR

1569
00:44:27,492 --> 00:44:28,860
FRIENDS AND LET THEM KNOW HOW

1570
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,028
MUCH YOU CARE.

1571
00:44:30,028 --> 00:44:30,862
TALK TO THEM.

1572
00:44:30,862 --> 00:44:32,464
FIND OUT ABOUT THEIR LIVES.

1573
00:44:32,464 --> 00:44:33,899
REALLY SHARE.

1574
00:44:33,899 --> 00:44:35,567
I MEAN, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO

1575
00:44:35,567 --> 00:44:36,268
LOSE?

1576
00:44:36,268 --> 00:44:37,069
THERE'S NOTHING GOOD ON

1577
00:44:37,069 --> 00:44:39,871
TELEVISION TILL BOXING DAY.

1578
00:44:39,871 --> 00:44:42,407
THINK ABOUT IT.

1579
00:44:44,943 --> 00:44:47,179
CHRISTMAS IS A TIME TO SLOW

1580
00:44:47,179 --> 00:44:48,814
DOWN A LITTLE.

1581
00:44:48,814 --> 00:44:49,915
A TIME TO SIT DOWN AND THINK

1582
00:44:49,915 --> 00:44:51,383
BACK OVER THE YEAR AND ASSESS

1583
00:44:51,383 --> 00:44:53,385
YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS.

1584
00:44:53,385 --> 00:44:54,352
YOU MAY REALIZE THAT YOU'VE

1585
00:44:54,352 --> 00:44:56,388
ACCOMPLISHED DIDDLY-SQUAT.

1586
00:44:56,388 --> 00:44:57,522
AND A YEAR OF YOUR LIFE IS GONE

1587
00:44:57,522 --> 00:44:59,825
FOREVER, AND WHAT THE HECK WERE

1588
00:44:59,825 --> 00:45:01,560
YOU THINKING?

1589
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,828
IN THAT CASE, FOCUS ON WHAT

1590
00:45:02,828 --> 00:45:04,362
OTHERS HAVE ACCOMPLISHED, AND

1591
00:45:04,362 --> 00:45:05,931
FEEL GOOD FOR THEM.

1592
00:45:05,931 --> 00:45:06,965
THINK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE

1593
00:45:06,965 --> 00:45:08,266
REALLY IMPRESSIVE THINGS OVER

1594
00:45:08,266 --> 00:45:09,534
THE LAST YEAR.

1595
00:45:09,534 --> 00:45:10,802
PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T WASTE A YEAR

1596
00:45:10,802 --> 00:45:12,070
OF THEIR--OKAY, OKAY, YOU KNOW

1597
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:12,737
WHAT?

1598
00:45:12,737 --> 00:45:13,371
I KNOW, I KNOW.

1599
00:45:13,371 --> 00:45:14,840
SIT DOWN AND WATCH A LOT OF

1600
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,874
CHRISTMAS SPECIALS ON

1601
00:45:15,874 --> 00:45:17,142
TELEVISION, AND DON'T THINK AT

1602
00:45:17,142 --> 00:45:18,944
ALL--THE SAME ONES YOU WATCHED

1603
00:45:18,944 --> 00:45:20,178
LAST YEAR AND THE YEAR

1604
00:45:20,178 --> 00:45:22,581
BEFORE--AND BASK IN THE WARM

1605
00:45:22,581 --> 00:45:24,082
GLOW OF KNOWING CHARLIE BROWN

1606
00:45:24,082 --> 00:45:25,951
AND FROSTY THE SNOWMAN AND THE

1607
00:45:25,951 --> 00:45:27,118
GRINCH WHO STOLE CHRISTMAS

1608
00:45:27,118 --> 00:45:32,123
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING NEW EITHER.

1609
00:45:34,025 --> 00:45:35,260
JOINING ME TODAY, WE GOT

1610
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:37,729
DALTON HUMPHREY--OR MAYBE I

1611
00:45:37,729 --> 00:45:40,899
SHOULD SAY, DALTON TENENBAUM.

1612
00:45:40,899 --> 00:45:41,933
ARE YOU HERE FOR CHRISTMAS OR

1613
00:45:41,933 --> 00:45:43,134
HALLOWEEN, DALTON?

1614
00:45:43,134 --> 00:45:44,069
WELL, YOU KNOW, RED, I

1615
00:45:44,069 --> 00:45:45,070
THOUGHT MAYBE TODAY WE COULD

1616
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:47,172
REPAIR THESE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS.

1617
00:45:47,172 --> 00:45:47,839
CHRISTMAS LIGHTS?

1618
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:48,673
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE

1619
00:45:48,673 --> 00:45:49,674
CELEBRATING CHRISTMAS.

1620
00:45:49,674 --> 00:45:50,508
DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL US IT WAS A

1621
00:45:50,508 --> 00:45:51,443
PAGAN RITUAL AND YOU WEREN'T

1622
00:45:51,443 --> 00:45:51,977
GOING TO HAVE ANY

1623
00:45:51,977 --> 00:45:53,011
PART OF IT, EH?

1624
00:45:53,011 --> 00:45:55,880
WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND?

1625
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:56,982
MY WIFE, ANNE-MARIE.

1626
00:45:56,982 --> 00:45:59,951
ALL RIGHT, YEAH.

1627
00:45:59,951 --> 00:46:01,252
HOW DID YOU GET ALL TANGLED UP

1628
00:46:01,252 --> 00:46:02,120
LIKE THIS, DALTON?

1629
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,054
WELL, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T WANT

1630
00:46:03,054 --> 00:46:04,022
TO GET OUT THE STEPLADDER FOR

1631
00:46:04,022 --> 00:46:05,056
JUST A LITTLE JOB LIKE THIS, SO

1632
00:46:05,056 --> 00:46:06,124
I GOT OUT THE KITCHEN CHAIRS AND

1633
00:46:06,124 --> 00:46:07,525
A COUPLE OF PHONE BOOKS, AND I

1634
00:46:07,525 --> 00:46:08,727
WAS UP THERE WITH A STAPLER,

1635
00:46:08,727 --> 00:46:09,661
PUTTING ON THE LIGHTS.

1636
00:46:09,661 --> 00:46:10,528
AND, OF COURSE, THEN THE YELLOW

1637
00:46:10,528 --> 00:46:12,731
PAGES SLIP OUT, AND I FALL OFF,

1638
00:46:12,731 --> 00:46:14,065
AND I ROLL OVER AND OVER AND

1639
00:46:14,065 --> 00:46:15,266
OVER DOWN THE HILL IN FRONT OF

1640
00:46:15,266 --> 00:46:17,168
MY HOUSE.

1641
00:46:17,168 --> 00:46:19,170
DALTON, PHONE BOOKS AND

1642
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:19,971
KITCHEN CHAIRS?

1643
00:46:19,971 --> 00:46:20,872
I KNOW.

1644
00:46:20,872 --> 00:46:22,073
YOU'RE ASKING FOR TROUBLE.

1645
00:46:22,073 --> 00:46:23,508
IT'S GOT TO BE ENCYCLOPEDIAS AND

1646
00:46:23,508 --> 00:46:26,978
END TABLES.

1647
00:46:26,978 --> 00:46:29,381
MAN, I--I KNOW YOU SELL

1648
00:46:29,381 --> 00:46:30,648
ANTIQUES, BUT THESE BABIES ARE

1649
00:46:30,648 --> 00:46:32,384
PREHISTORIC.

1650
00:46:32,384 --> 00:46:33,318
WELL, COME ON, NOW, YOU ONLY

1651
00:46:33,318 --> 00:46:34,185
USE THESE A WEEK OUT OF THE

1652
00:46:34,185 --> 00:46:34,753
YEAR.

1653
00:46:34,753 --> 00:46:35,520
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO SPEND

1654
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,354
MONEY ON SOMETHING YOU HARDLY

1655
00:46:36,354 --> 00:46:37,555
USE?

1656
00:46:37,555 --> 00:46:38,356
YOU FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT

1657
00:46:38,356 --> 00:46:43,695
COMBS, DO YOU?

1658
00:46:43,695 --> 00:46:45,396
THESE LIGHTS WORK, DALTON?

1659
00:46:45,396 --> 00:46:46,231
WELL, YOU KNOW,

1660
00:46:46,231 --> 00:46:47,398
THEY--THEY--WHEN I--I TESTED

1661
00:46:47,398 --> 00:46:48,767
THEM BEFORE I TRIED TO HANG THEM

1662
00:46:48,767 --> 00:46:51,402
UP, YOU KNOW, NOTHING.

1663
00:46:51,402 --> 00:46:52,303
OH, MAN, YOU KNOW, THESE ARE

1664
00:46:52,303 --> 00:46:52,871
THE OLD KIND.

1665
00:46:52,871 --> 00:46:53,772
LIKE, ONE GOES OUT, NONE OF THEM

1666
00:46:53,772 --> 00:46:54,472
WORK.

1667
00:46:54,472 --> 00:46:55,140
OH?

1668
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:55,740
YEAH.

1669
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:56,775
WELL, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE

1670
00:46:56,775 --> 00:46:58,510
SAYING IT'S IMPOSSIBLE, YEAH,

1671
00:46:58,510 --> 00:46:59,978
I'LL JUST TELL ANNE-MARIE, "RED

1672
00:46:59,978 --> 00:47:01,346
GREEN SAYS NO CHRISTMAS LIGHTS

1673
00:47:01,346 --> 00:47:02,847
THIS YEAR.

1674
00:47:02,847 --> 00:47:04,282
YEP, THE KING OF THE HANDYMEN

1675
00:47:04,282 --> 00:47:05,783
CAN'T SAVE A FAMILY'S

1676
00:47:05,783 --> 00:47:08,553
CHRISTMAS."

1677
00:47:08,553 --> 00:47:09,053
WHAT?

1678
00:47:09,053 --> 00:47:09,687
COME ON OVER HERE.

1679
00:47:09,687 --> 00:47:10,688
I GOT AN EXTENSION CORD.

1680
00:47:10,688 --> 00:47:14,592
OH...

1681
00:47:14,592 --> 00:47:18,730
ALL RIGHT, STAND STILL.

1682
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:21,266
[electricity crackling]

1683
00:47:21,266 --> 00:47:22,667
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

1684
00:47:22,667 --> 00:47:23,601
OH--OH, JEEZ, RED.

1685
00:47:23,601 --> 00:47:24,769
I'M GETTING SHOCKED--THOUSANDS

1686
00:47:24,769 --> 00:47:26,170
OF LITTLE FINGERS TICKLING ME

1687
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:29,140
ALL OVER MY BODY.

1688
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,108
YEAH, SORRY ABOUT THAT,

1689
00:47:30,108 --> 00:47:30,642
DALTON.

1690
00:47:30,642 --> 00:47:32,744
NO, IT'S OKAY, I DON'T MIND.

1691
00:47:32,744 --> 00:47:33,244
WHOO!

1692
00:47:33,244 --> 00:47:33,945
WHOO!

1693
00:47:33,945 --> 00:47:34,846
IS THERE--IS THERE ANY PART

1694
00:47:34,846 --> 00:47:36,014
OF YOUR BODY THAT'S NOT

1695
00:47:36,014 --> 00:47:36,614
TINGLING?

1696
00:47:36,614 --> 00:47:37,382
THE LEFT KNEE.

1697
00:47:37,382 --> 00:47:38,016
MY LEFT KNEE.

1698
00:47:38,016 --> 00:47:38,883
WELL, THAT'LL BE THE TROUBLE

1699
00:47:38,883 --> 00:47:39,384
BULB.

1700
00:47:39,384 --> 00:47:39,918
THERE WE GO.

1701
00:47:39,918 --> 00:47:40,885
THERE WE GO.

1702
00:47:40,885 --> 00:47:41,419
COME ON.

1703
00:47:41,419 --> 00:47:41,953
THERE WE GO.

1704
00:47:41,953 --> 00:47:43,154
THERE WE GO.

1705
00:47:43,154 --> 00:47:45,657
[laughing]

1706
00:47:45,657 --> 00:47:47,091
BOY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

1707
00:47:47,091 --> 00:47:50,061
I'M GETTING SOME IDEAS HERE.

1708
00:47:50,061 --> 00:47:51,029
I DON'T THINK WE NEED A TREE

1709
00:47:51,029 --> 00:47:52,397
THIS YEAR.

1710
00:47:52,397 --> 00:47:55,366
[laughter and applause]

1711
00:48:00,605 --> 00:48:01,906
YOU KNOW, AROUND CHRISTMASTIME,

1712
00:48:01,906 --> 00:48:03,041
PEOPLE LIKE TO PUT A DISPLAY OF

1713
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:05,009
SOME KIND OUT ON THEIR LAWN.

1714
00:48:05,009 --> 00:48:06,044
USUALLY IT'S GOT THE COLORED

1715
00:48:06,044 --> 00:48:07,011
LIGHTS ON IT OR MAYBE SANTA ON

1716
00:48:07,011 --> 00:48:08,713
HIS SLEIGH OR SOMETHING.

1717
00:48:08,713 --> 00:48:09,280
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

1718
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,314
I PREFER SOMETHING THAT REFLECTS

1719
00:48:10,314 --> 00:48:11,949
THE TRUE MEANING OF CHRISTMAS:

1720
00:48:11,949 --> 00:48:13,885
KEEP IT CHEAP.

1721
00:48:13,885 --> 00:48:14,719
I'M THINKING, GET A BUNCH OF

1722
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:16,120
APPLIANCES AND MAKE YOURSELF A

1723
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,089
NATIVITY SCENE.

1724
00:48:18,089 --> 00:48:19,323
STOVE HERE--WELL, THAT WOULD BE

1725
00:48:19,323 --> 00:48:20,391
THE VIRGIN MARY.

1726
00:48:20,391 --> 00:48:21,459
GET ONE FROM A PRIEST, FOR

1727
00:48:21,459 --> 00:48:23,127
OBVIOUS REASONS.

1728
00:48:23,127 --> 00:48:24,328
AND THEN THE FRIDGE, OF COURSE,

1729
00:48:24,328 --> 00:48:25,163
THAT'S JOSEPH.

1730
00:48:25,163 --> 00:48:27,698
KIND OF TALL AND QUIET AND COOL.

1731
00:48:27,698 --> 00:48:28,699
AND GET YOURSELF THREE

1732
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:30,134
COMPUTERS.

1733
00:48:30,134 --> 00:48:31,369
THAT'S YOUR WISE MEN.

1734
00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:32,770
AND LOOK AT THIS--I EVEN GOT THE

1735
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:34,038
LITTLE DRUMMER BOY.

1736
00:48:34,038 --> 00:48:35,039
[funky percussive music playing]

1737
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:38,409
[funky percussive music playing]

1738
00:48:38,409 --> 00:48:39,677
OH, HERE'S AN EXTRA BONUS:

1739
00:48:39,677 --> 00:48:41,746
A SHEPHERD.

1740
00:48:42,547 --> 00:48:43,414
WE KNOW WE GOT A LOT OF KIDS

1741
00:48:43,414 --> 00:48:44,449
WATCHING THIS CHRISTMAS SPECIAL

1742
00:48:44,449 --> 00:48:45,383
'CAUSE YOUR PARENTS ARE SITTING

1743
00:48:45,383 --> 00:48:46,350
RIGHT THERE, AND YOU CAN'T ZAP

00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:47,418

00:48:47,418 --> 00:48:50,188
VIDEO STATION, CAN YOU?

1746
00:48:50,188 --> 00:48:52,023
SO HAROLD AND I THOUGHT WE WOULD

1747
00:48:52,023 --> 00:48:53,191
GIVE YOU KIDS A TIP.

1748
00:48:53,191 --> 00:48:54,058
YEAH, YEAH, YOU KNOW, LIKE,

1749
00:48:54,058 --> 00:48:54,859
OKAY, YOU LOOK UNDER THE

1750
00:48:54,859 --> 00:48:55,660
CHRISTMAS TREE, AND THERE'S

1751
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:56,527
SOME EARLY PRESENTS THERE, AND

1752
00:48:56,527 --> 00:48:57,061
THEY GOT TAGS WITH

1753
00:48:57,061 --> 00:48:57,995
YOUR NAMES ON IT?

1754
00:48:57,995 --> 00:48:58,963
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT GRAB AND

1755
00:48:58,963 --> 00:48:59,831
SHAKE THEM, AND FIND OUT WHAT'S

1756
00:48:59,831 --> 00:49:00,765
IN THEM, RIGHT, RIGHT?

1757
00:49:00,765 --> 00:49:01,599
UNCLE RED, WOULD YOU GRAB ME

1758
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:02,166
A GIFT?

1759
00:49:02,166 --> 00:49:02,667
YEAH, SURE.

1760
00:49:02,667 --> 00:49:03,467
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN TELL A LOT

1761
00:49:03,467 --> 00:49:04,402
BY THE WEIGHT OF THESE GIFTS,

1762
00:49:04,402 --> 00:49:05,436
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE YOU CAN FIND

1763
00:49:05,436 --> 00:49:06,604
OUT OF IT'S SOLID, YOU KNOW, OR

1764
00:49:06,604 --> 00:49:08,306
IF IT MOVES AROUND IN THE BOX.

1765
00:49:08,306 --> 00:49:09,507
YEAH, THIS ONE'S KIND OF, I'D

1766
00:49:09,507 --> 00:49:10,741
SAY, AVERAGE WEIGHT.

1767
00:49:10,741 --> 00:49:12,176
BUT IT'S PRETTY SOLID, SO IT'S

1768
00:49:12,176 --> 00:49:13,277
NOT GONNA SHAKE AROUND TOO MUCH.

1769
00:49:13,277 --> 00:49:15,012
AND MAINLY, IT'S NOT CLOTHES.

1770
00:49:15,012 --> 00:49:16,814
THAT'S THE GOOD PART.

1771
00:49:16,814 --> 00:49:17,815
REAL IMPORTANT TEST, THOUGH,

1772
00:49:17,815 --> 00:49:18,749
IS THE SHAKING TEST.

1773
00:49:18,749 --> 00:49:19,951
YOU GOT TO REALLY SHAKE IT.

1774
00:49:19,951 --> 00:49:20,885
YEAH, BECAUSE IT HELPS YOU

1775
00:49:20,885 --> 00:49:21,919
DECIDE WHETHER IT'S LIQUID OR

1776
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,421
IT'S A SOLID, OR PERHAPS THERE'S

1777
00:49:23,421 --> 00:49:24,455
TWO GIFTS IN THERE.

1778
00:49:24,455 --> 00:49:25,856
WAH, WAH, WAH.

1779
00:49:25,856 --> 00:49:27,258
BUT DON'T BE AFRAID TO SHAKE IT.

1780
00:49:27,258 --> 00:49:28,192
REALLY GIVE HER A GO WHEN YOU'RE

1781
00:49:28,192 --> 00:49:28,759
SHAKING IT.

1782

[glass shattering]

1783
00:49:31,162 --> 00:49:34,832
OH, OH, OH.

1784
00:49:34,832 --> 00:49:36,067
YEAH.

1785
00:49:36,067 --> 00:49:37,468
NOW, THAT'S HOW YOU LEARN.

[broken glass rattling]

1787
00:49:40,438 --> 00:49:41,906
WE KNOW NOW THAT THIS GIFT IS

1788
00:49:41,906 --> 00:49:44,275
MADE OF GLASS.

1789
00:49:44,275 --> 00:49:45,509
AND THERE'S SOME ASSEMBLY

1790
00:49:45,509 --> 00:49:48,746
REQUIRED.

1791
00:49:53,985 --> 00:49:55,319
I FORGOT TO MENTION, WHEN

1792
00:49:55,319 --> 00:49:56,721
SHAKING ANY GIFT, ALWAYS GET

1793
00:49:56,721 --> 00:49:58,289
A GRIP.

1794
00:49:58,289 --> 00:49:59,123
THAT WOULD BE A DREAM COME

1795
00:49:59,123 --> 00:50:01,225
TRUE FOR ME, HAROLD.

1796
00:50:01,225 --> 00:50:02,126
WELL, THIS PARTICULAR GIFT,

1797
00:50:02,126 --> 00:50:03,194
THE NEXT ONE, IT DOESN'T FEEL AS

1798
00:50:03,194 --> 00:50:03,694
HEAVY.

1799
00:50:03,694 --> 00:50:04,195
NO?

1800
00:50:04,195 --> 00:50:05,396
NO, THIS--THE EDGES SEEM

1801
00:50:05,396 --> 00:50:06,530
SOFT.

1802
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:08,466
IT'S DEFINITELY LIQUID-FILLED.

1803
00:50:08,466 --> 00:50:09,734
BUT, NOW, THE SHAKE TEST.

1804
00:50:09,734 --> 00:50:10,735
THIS WILL DETERMINE ALL.

1805
00:50:10,735 --> 00:50:11,535

[screaming]

1811
00:50:31,288 --> 00:50:32,223
NEVER SHAKE A GIFT THAT'S

00:50:32,223 --> 00:50:35,593
BREATHING.

1813

YEAH, YEAH, HE'S A--HE'S A

CHRISTMAS SEASON.

NOW, MY ADVICE WILL BE MOSTLY

1824
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:54,812
FOCUSED ON SAVING MONEY, WHEREAS

1825
00:50:54,812 --> 00:50:56,647
GORD'S ADVICE HERE WON'T BE

1826
00:50:56,647 --> 00:50:57,681
LIKELY FOCUSED ON ANYTHING

1827
00:50:57,681 --> 00:50:59,884
AT ALL.

1828
00:50:59,884 --> 00:51:00,751

GORD, GORD, GORD, SEE, I'VE

1833

ALREADY DONE THE INTRODUCTIONS.

1834
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:07,758
DON'T NEED TO DO THEM TWO TIMES.

1835
00:51:07,758 --> 00:51:09,460
OH, GOOD IDEA.

1836
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:10,060

WEIRD.

1853
00:51:29,246 --> 00:51:30,614
NO, IT'S--IT'S--IT'S TYPICAL.

1854
00:51:30,614 --> 00:51:31,515
IT'S NOT WEIRD.

1855
00:51:31,515 --> 00:51:32,316
THERE'S NOTHING WEIRD ABOUT

1856
00:51:32,316 --> 00:51:32,950
THIS.

1857
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:34,251
IT'S JUST--IT'S...

1858
00:51:34,251 --> 00:51:35,119
NO, I WAS TALKING ABOUT YOUR

1859
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,322
HAIR.

1860
00:51:38,322 --> 00:51:39,123

YES, THANK YOU.

1862
00:51:39,923 --> 00:51:41,325
NOW THE POINT I WOULD LIKE TO

1863
00:51:41,325 --> 00:51:43,060

1870
00:51:50,768 --> 00:51:51,468
IS THIS FOR ME?

1871
00:51:51,468 --> 00:51:52,136
I CAN'T WAIT.

1872
00:51:52,136 --> 00:51:52,870
I CAN'T WAIT.

1873
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:53,904

LOOK AT THAT.

1881
00:52:04,648 --> 00:52:07,618
[applause]

1882
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:12,056
WOW, YOU REALLY CUT LOOSE

1883
00:52:12,056 --> 00:52:13,390
THERE, DALTON.

1884
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:14,892
BOY, YOU KNOW, COME TO THINK

1885
00:52:14,892 --> 00:52:15,626
OF IT, I SURE DID.

1886
00:52:15,626 --> 00:52:16,460
I'VE NEVER OPENED A GIFT THAT

1887
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,195
WAY BEFORE.

1888
00:52:18,195 --> 00:52:19,196
BOY, IT REALLY TOOK ME BACK TO

1889
00:52:19,196 --> 00:52:21,532
THE WAY I USED TO FEEL AS A KID.

1890
00:52:21,532 --> 00:52:22,566
WELL, ACTUALLY I NEVER REALLY

1891
00:52:22,566 --> 00:52:23,967
DID FEEL LIKE I WAS--LIKE THAT

1892
00:52:23,967 --> 00:52:25,102
WHEN I WAS KID 'CAUSE MY DAD

1893
00:52:25,102 --> 00:52:26,170
SAID IF I DID, I'D GROW UP

1894
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:28,338
FUNNY, BUT...

1895
00:52:28,338 --> 00:52:29,473
YEAH.

1896
00:52:29,473 --> 00:52:31,041
IS YOUR DAD STILL ALIVE?

1897
00:52:31,041 --> 00:52:35,145
EH, PROBABLY.

1898
00:52:35,145 --> 00:52:38,749
MY POINT IS THIS: WHAT A WASTE

1899
00:52:38,749 --> 00:52:40,551
OF WRAPPING PAPER.

1900
00:52:40,551 --> 00:52:42,619
NOW, WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS TEACH

1901
00:52:42,619 --> 00:52:45,522
OUR CHILDREN HOW TO DO THIS--HOW

1902
00:52:45,522 --> 00:52:48,292
TO TAKE THE TAPE OFF THE PAPER

1903
00:52:48,292 --> 00:52:49,893
SO THAT WE SAVE IT AND BE ABLE

1904
00:52:49,893 --> 00:52:52,896
TO USE IT YEAR AFTER YEAR.

1905
00:52:52,896 --> 00:52:53,997
THIS IS THE WAY MY FATHER TAUGHT

1906
00:52:53,997 --> 00:52:55,199
ME.

1907
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:56,833
PLACE YOUR FINGER UNDER THE LIP

1908
00:52:56,833 --> 00:52:58,035
OF THE GIFT.

1909
00:52:58,035 --> 00:52:58,869
DALTON, BEFORE YOU GO ON

1910
00:52:58,869 --> 00:53:00,070
THERE, LET ME JUST ADD SOMETHING

1911
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:02,839
TO YOUR LAST POINT, IF I MIGHT.

1912
00:53:02,839 --> 00:53:04,274
FOLKS, IF YOU HAPPEN TO GET A

1913
00:53:04,274 --> 00:53:06,210
GOLDFISH FOR CHRISTMAS AND THE

1914
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:09,179
GOLDFISH DIES, YOU CAN FLUSH IT.

1915
00:53:09,179 --> 00:53:10,547
BUT, IF YOU GET A POINSETTIA,

1916
00:53:10,547 --> 00:53:12,316
AND THE POINSETTIA DIES, DON'T

1917
00:53:12,316 --> 00:53:15,052
FLUSH IT, OKAY?

1918
00:53:15,052 --> 00:53:17,955
BAD MISTAKE.

1919
00:53:21,058 --> 00:53:22,759
THANK YOU.

1920
00:53:22,759 --> 00:53:25,462
GORD...

1921
00:53:25,462 --> 00:53:27,898
THAT DOESN'T ADD TO MY POINT.

1922
00:53:27,898 --> 00:53:29,866
THAT DOESN'T ADD TO ANY POINT.

1923
00:53:29,866 --> 00:53:31,468
NOW, LISTEN, SEE, IT'S NOT YOUR

1924
00:53:31,468 --> 00:53:32,502
TURN YET 'CAUSE I'M NOT

1925
00:53:32,502 --> 00:53:33,303
FINISHED.

1926
00:53:33,303 --> 00:53:34,471
SO WHEN IT IS YOUR TURN, THEN

1927
00:53:34,471 --> 00:53:35,372
YOU CAN GIVE YOUR SAFETY TIP,

1928
00:53:35,372 --> 00:53:36,039
OKAY?

1929
00:53:36,039 --> 00:53:36,540
ALL RIGHT.

1930
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:37,107
NO, IT'S OKAY.

1931
00:53:37,107 --> 00:53:38,208
I'VE ALREADY DONE IT.

1932
00:53:38,208 --> 00:53:39,009
THANK YOU.

1933
00:53:39,009 --> 00:53:39,810
I'M DONE.

1934
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:40,310
OKAY.

1935
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:41,178
WELL, THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE

1936
00:53:41,178 --> 00:53:41,678
HAVE.

1937
00:53:41,678 --> 00:53:42,646
GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.

1938
00:53:42,646 --> 00:53:44,214
NOW, WAIT, STOP!

1939
00:53:44,214 --> 00:53:45,182
WHAT WAS THE POINT OF ME

1940
00:53:45,182 --> 00:53:45,882
BRINGING THIS STUFF?

1941
00:53:45,882 --> 00:53:47,551
IT'S A WASTE.

1942
00:53:47,551 --> 00:53:48,952
IT'S A WASTE!

1943
00:53:48,952 --> 00:53:49,820
WELL, HERE, I'LL FLUSH IT FOR

1944
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:50,387

1945
00:53:50,387 --> 00:53:51,088

WHAT DOES THAT SAY?

2011
00:55:54,644 --> 00:55:55,578
OH, "TO HAROLD, FROM UNCLE
