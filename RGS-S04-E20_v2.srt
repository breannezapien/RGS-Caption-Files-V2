TO TURN YOUR CAR INTO A TANK.

GOING TO NEED IS A ROLL

ONLY GOING TO WORK THE WHEELS
ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE CAR,

135
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:05,431

DISCONNECT THE BRAKE LINES

FROM THE RIGHT
SIDE OF CAR,

AND THEN WHEN YOU STEP
ON THE BRAKE PEDAL,

138
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:11,336
IT WILL ONLY WORK THE WHEELS
ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CAR.

OKAY, I DON'T KNOW WHY
I'M BEING SO FINICKY.

149
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:42,968
I MEAN, THE GOAL IS JUST
TO DISCONNECT THE BRAKE LINES.

150
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:45,304
NOBODY SAYS WE HAVE TO
UNSCREW THEM OFF THERE.

151
00:06:49,508 --> 00:06:50,943
ALL RIGHT.

152
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,912
NOW, YOU GOT TO HAVE
ROOM FOR THE TANK TREAD

153
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:55,647
TO MOVE FREELY
AROUND THE CAR,

154
00:06:55,647 --> 00:06:59,051
SO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO IS
YOU GOT CUT OFF THE FRONT
HALF OF THE FRONT FENDER

155
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:00,852
AND THE BACK HALF
OF THE BACK FENDER,

156
00:07:00,852 --> 00:07:03,622
AND YOU CAN DO THAT WITH,
WELL, JUST AN ORDINARY HACKSAW.

157
00:07:12,197 --> 00:07:14,232
[ PANTING ]

158
00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:17,436
[ PANTING ]

159
00:07:23,675 --> 00:07:27,279
I'LL TELL YOU, THEY HAVEN'T
INVENTED THE CAR THAT
I CAN'T CUSTOMIZE.

160
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:34,186
THERE WE GO.

161
00:07:34,186 --> 00:07:35,754
NOW, YOU'RE READY FOR
YOUR TANK TREAD.

162
00:07:35,754 --> 00:07:38,356
AND FOR THAT YOU'RE GOING
TO NEED A TANK TREAD,

163
00:07:38,356 --> 00:07:40,559
WHICH YOU CAN BUY THROUGH AN
ARMY SURPLUS MAGAZINE,

164
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:43,962
OR YOU CAN MAKE ONE OUT
OF AN ESCALATOR.

165
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:45,864
IF YOU'RE NOT
MADE OF MONEY,

166
00:07:45,864 --> 00:07:47,999
I SUGGEST YOU JUST
GO WITH A SNOW FENCE.

167
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:49,734
NOW, THE SNOW FENCE IS
TWICE AS WIDE AS YOU NEED,

168
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:51,203
SO YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
TO CUT HER IN HALF,

169
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:54,039
WHICH YOU CAN DO WITH A
NORMAL HOUSEHOLD HACKSAW.

170
00:07:56,007 --> 00:07:57,943
OR AN AXE.

171
00:08:07,886 --> 00:08:10,021
OKAY, YOU SEE THE
PROBLEM HERE --

172
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:12,157
I'M SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T
THINK OF THIS EARLIER,

173
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:13,892
YOU NEED SOMETHING
TO USE AS GUIDES

174
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:15,894
TO KEEP THE TREAD
UP ABOVE THE ROOF.

175
00:08:15,894 --> 00:08:17,762
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING
IN THE TRUNK.

176
00:08:17,762 --> 00:08:20,065
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

177
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:24,102
OH, I DON'T HAVE TO GO
TO ALL THAT TROUBLE, DO I?

178
00:08:24,102 --> 00:08:26,805
NO, IT'S AN OLD SET
OF GOLF CLUBS.

179
00:08:26,805 --> 00:08:29,107
WAIT A MINUTE.

180
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:31,142
I GOT AN IDEA.

181
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,247
I ALWAYS SAID MY IDEAS
ARE WAY ABOVE PAR.

182
00:08:35,247 --> 00:08:37,616
WELL, SHE'S READY
TO ROLL, HUH?

183
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:40,352
WHEN I WANT TO TURN LEFT,
I JUST STEP ON THE
BRAKE PEDAL,

184
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:43,054
WHEN I WANT TO TURN RIGHT,
I STEP ON THE EMERGENCY.

185
00:08:43,054 --> 00:08:45,490
I DON'T EVEN NEED A MAP
OF WHERE I'M GOING,

186
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,859
ALL'S I NEED ARE
THE COORDINATES.

187
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:49,027
SO REMEMBER,

188
00:08:49,027 --> 00:08:50,495
IF THE WOMEN DON'T
FIND YOU HANDSOME,

189
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:52,163
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

190
00:08:52,163 --> 00:08:54,566
LET'S SEE HOW SHE HANDLES.

191
00:09:04,943 --> 00:09:08,246
Red: STAY TUNED TO SEE WHAT
HAPPENS TO BILL WHEN THE
CHIPS HIT THE FAN,

192
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:10,749
AND THEN GLEN IS GOING
TO LET ME HELP OUT
AT THE MARINA,

193
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:12,650
NICE OF HIM.

194
00:09:16,988 --> 00:09:20,025
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ALL YOU
MIDDLE AGED GUYS ABOUT
FADING URGES.

195
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:21,860
YOU KNOW THAT SENSE THAT
YOU'RE MAYBE NOT

196
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,561
THE PASSIONATE LOVER
YOU ONCE WERE --

197
00:09:23,561 --> 00:09:25,630
AT LEAST THE WAY
YOU TELL IT.

198
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:29,434
OKAY, SO MAYBE YOU'VE CHANGED
FROM BEING A YOUNG STAG
EAGER TO RUT

199
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:32,370
INTO AN OLD DRAG
STUCK IN A RUT.

200
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,973
WELL, THIS IS A GOOD THING

201
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:37,008
BECAUSE THERE'S LESS CHANCE
THAT YOU'LL BE A FATHER

202
00:09:37,008 --> 00:09:38,910
AT A TIME WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE
THE PATIENCE, ENERGY

203
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,713
OR BRAIN POWER
TO HELP WITH HOMEWORK.

204
00:09:41,713 --> 00:09:44,649
AND THERE'S ANOTHER UPSIDE
TO LOSS OF YOUR SEX DRIVE,

205
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:46,951
AND THAT IS THAT THIS MEANS
ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK,

206
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:48,787
FOR MAYBE TWO OR
THREE MINUTES AT A TIME,

207
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:52,023
YOU'LL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO
CONCENTRATE ON SOMETHING ELSE,

208
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:54,726
LIKE, SAY, YOUR JOB.

209
00:09:54,726 --> 00:09:56,795
YOU REALIZE THAT MOST OF
LIFE'S GREAT DISCOVERIES

210
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:59,564
WERE DONE BY GUYS
WHO WERE OLD?

211
00:09:59,564 --> 00:10:01,666
LIKE COLONEL SANDERS,
HE WAS ALMOST RETIRED

212
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,102
BEFORE HE GOT THE INSPIRATION
TO DEDICATE HIS LIFE

213
00:10:04,102 --> 00:10:06,237
TO FRIED CHICKEN.

214
00:10:06,237 --> 00:10:10,208
AND WHAT ABOUT THAT 70-YEAR-OLD
TELEVISION PRODUCER
AARON SPELLING?

215
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,143
I'LL TELL YOU, NOBODY WHO
WAS SEXUALLY ACTIVE

216
00:10:12,143 --> 00:10:15,580
WOULD HAVE COME UP WITH A
CONCEPT LIKE "THE LOVE BOAT."

217
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,449
SO I SAY JUST ACCEPT YOUR
DECLINING DESIRES.

218
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:20,618
YOUR WIFE IS PROBABLY
JUST AS HAPPY TO READ IN BED,

219
00:10:20,618 --> 00:10:22,687
AND THIS WAY YOU GET TO SEE
THE END OF THE HOCKEY GAME

220
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:24,589
EVEN IF THERE'S OVERTIME.

221
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:26,758
REMEMBER,
I'M PULLING FOR YOU

222
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:29,093
'CAUSE WE ARE ALL
IN THIS TOGETHER.

223
00:10:32,797 --> 00:10:36,901
WELL, WE RAN INTO A SNAG
TRYING TO JUMP START
STINKY'S TRABANT.

224
00:10:36,901 --> 00:10:38,870
WENT DOWN THERE
IN STINKY'S TRUCK,

225
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,805
AND THE BATTERY IN THAT
THING IS IN NO GREAT
SHAKES EITHER,

226
00:10:40,805 --> 00:10:42,607
BECAUSE HE HAD
A CRACK IN IT,

227
00:10:42,607 --> 00:10:44,642
AND HE KEPT TOPPING
IT UP WITH VINEGAR.

228
00:10:44,642 --> 00:10:46,945
SO THEN HE FIGURES IF HE
GETS THE TRUCK REAL CLOSE
THAT WILL WORK

229
00:10:46,945 --> 00:10:49,113
'CAUSE THE ELECTRICITY WON'T
HAVE TO TRAVEL AS FAR.

230
00:10:49,113 --> 00:10:50,748
THAT WON'T MAKE
ANY DIFFERENCE.

231
00:10:50,748 --> 00:10:52,450
WELL, I KNOW THAT,
HAROLD,

232
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,219
BUT THEN I'M NOT STUPID,
AND NOBODY CALLS ME
STINKY, DO THEY?

233
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:57,288
IF YOU SAY SO.

234
00:11:01,492 --> 00:11:03,161
SO STINKY --

235
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,166
STINKY DROVE HIS TRUCK AROUND
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRABANT

236
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,134
AND HE GOT THE REAR WHEELS
STUCK IN A SINK HOLE

237
00:11:10,134 --> 00:11:11,936
LIKE ONE OF THEM MUDBATHS
THAT RICH PEOPLE GO TO

238
00:11:11,936 --> 00:11:14,972
TO SEE WHAT IT FEELS
LIKE TO BE DIRTY.

239
00:11:14,972 --> 00:11:18,609
SO NOW HE'S GOT HIS CAR
AND HIS TRUCK STUCK AT
THE SIDE OF THE ROAD?

240
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:20,745
HAVE YOU GOT FLINTY'S
EMERGENCY PHONE NUMBER

241
00:11:20,745 --> 00:11:23,081
BECAUSE I'LL LEND
YOU THE $5.

242
00:11:23,081 --> 00:11:24,916
IT'S NOT THE MONEY, HAROLD,
NOT TOTALLY.

243
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,751
WE'RE MEN,
WE HAVE PRIDE.

244
00:11:26,751 --> 00:11:28,352
STINKY'S GIRLFRIEND CAUSED
THE PROBLEM,

245
00:11:28,352 --> 00:11:30,121
IT'S UP TO STINKY
TO SOLVE IT.

246
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:32,156
IS SHE STILL STUCK AT
THE SIDE OF THE ROAD?

247
00:11:32,156 --> 00:11:33,558
WELL, ACTUALLY, NO,

248
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:35,793
SHE GOT A RIDE INTO TOWN
WITH A PASSING VEHICLE,

249
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:39,130
FLINTY'S ROAD
EMERGENCY THING.

250
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,798
OH, THIS IS GOOD.

251
00:11:40,798 --> 00:11:43,401
SO NOW HE'S LOST HIS CAR,
HIS TRUCK AND HIS GIRLFRIEND.

252
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:45,903
YEAH, BUT HE'S STILL
GOT HIS PRIDE.

253
00:11:45,903 --> 00:11:47,872
WINSTON ROTHSCHILD HERE

254
00:11:47,872 --> 00:11:50,942
OF ROTHSCHILD'S SEWAGE
AND SEPTIC SUCKING SERVICES.

255
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:54,645
CALL ME IF YOU GOT A GUSHER
AND CAN'T FLUSHER,

256
00:11:54,645 --> 00:11:57,582
1-800-555-SUCK.

257
00:11:59,584 --> 00:12:01,552
Red: NOW, HERE WE ARE AT
BRAXTON'S MARINA

258
00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:02,954
WITH OWNER/OPERATOR
GLEN BRAXTON.

259
00:12:02,954 --> 00:12:04,655
HOW ARE YOU
TODAY, GLEN?

260
00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:06,424
ON THE ROAD TO
RECOVERY, RED.

261
00:12:06,424 --> 00:12:08,426
FEELING BETTER THAN I DID
BEFORE THE HEART ATTACKS.
GREAT.

262
00:12:08,426 --> 00:12:09,961
CUT WAY BACK ON
THE DRINKING,

263
00:12:09,961 --> 00:12:11,362
QUIT SMOKING, YOU KNOW.

264
00:12:11,362 --> 00:12:13,097
YEAH, AND I GUESS THE
CHOCOLATE ECLAIRS

265
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:14,899
WITH THE DOUBLE
WHIPPED CREAM ON TOP

266
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:16,934
ARE PRETTY MUCH A THING
OF THE PAST, ARE THEY NOT?

267
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:19,103
WELL, ONE STEP
AT A TIME, RED.

268
00:12:19,103 --> 00:12:21,539
WELL, TODAY WE'RE GOING
TO LEARN HOW TO PULL A
BOAT OUT OF THE WATER.

269
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:23,774
WHAT WE GOT TO DO IS WE
GOT TO HOOK THIS BOAT WINCH

270
00:12:23,774 --> 00:12:26,110
ON TO THAT LITTLE RING
THERE ON THE BOTTOM.
YEAH.

271
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,346
HERE YOU GO, RED.
ME?

272
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:30,014
ON, YEAH, SINCE THE
HEART ATTACK, RED,

273
00:12:30,014 --> 00:12:33,317
I CAN'T GET TOO CLOSE
TO THE WATER.
ALL RIGHT.

274
00:12:33,317 --> 00:12:35,453
BOY, IT SURE IS ODD
TO LOOK AT THE BOAT
RAMP THERE

275
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:37,555
AND NOT SEE YOUR OLD
R.V. SITTING IN IT,
I'LL TELL YOU.

276
00:12:37,555 --> 00:12:40,091
WELL, LIFE IS FULL
OF CHOICES, RED.

277
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:43,928
I HAD THE BUSINESS,
I HAD THE FAMILY,
HAD THE R.V.

278
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:45,896
I COULDN'T KEEP THEM ALL.

279
00:12:45,896 --> 00:12:47,965
OTHER PEOPLE DO.

280
00:12:47,965 --> 00:12:49,533
OH WELL, I GUESS.

281
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:51,669
BUT OTHER PEOPLE DON'T
HAVE SEVEN DAUGHTERS

282
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:53,971
THAT NEVER WEAR
HAND-ME-DOWNS EVER.

283
00:12:53,971 --> 00:12:56,140
GOT 'ER.
GREAT.

284
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,276
YOU CAN CRANK
HER UP, RED.

285
00:12:59,276 --> 00:13:01,545
OH MAN.

286
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,115
I TELL YOU ONE THING,
THOUGH, GLEN,

287
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:06,384
I THINK THESE HARD TIMES
HAVE BEEN GOOD FOR YOU.

288
00:13:06,384 --> 00:13:08,686
OH 'ABSOTUTELY,' RED.
YEAH.

289
00:13:08,686 --> 00:13:11,088
MY PRIORITIES ARE
BACK IN LINE.

290
00:13:11,088 --> 00:13:12,757
NEVER MIND THE FACT,
YOU KNOW,

291
00:13:12,757 --> 00:13:15,226
MY ENTREPRENEURIAL
OPPORTUNITIES
ON THE LAKE.

292
00:13:15,226 --> 00:13:17,228
I'M THE ONLY MARINA.
YEAH.

293
00:13:17,228 --> 00:13:19,497
KEEPS THE MARGIN
IN LINE.
SURE.

294
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:22,633
YOU KNOW, I'M WONDERING IF
THIS BOAT WINCH WOULD BE
STRONG ENOUGH

295
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:25,503
TO PULL, SAY, A COUPLE
OF TRUCKS OUT OF THE MUD?

296
00:13:25,503 --> 00:13:28,205
OH I GOT THREE-TONNE
BLOCK AND TACKLE UP
BEHIND THE HOUSE.

297
00:13:28,205 --> 00:13:29,807
YOU CAN -- I CAN RENT
IT TO YOU

298
00:13:29,807 --> 00:13:32,243
OR YOU CAN
BORROW IT FOR MONEY,
WHATEVER YOU LIKE.

299
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:34,011
YEAH, WELL, WE'LL WORK
SOMETHING OUT.

300
00:13:34,011 --> 00:13:35,379
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S GOT HER.

301
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:36,847
SHOULD WE HAVE DONE
SOMETHING

302
00:13:36,847 --> 00:13:39,250
TO MAKE SURE THE BOAT IS ON
THERE STRAIGHT, DO YOU THINK?

303
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,919
OH, NO RED, NO, NO,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT THAT.

304
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,787
IF IT'S NOT, YOU JUST
DROP HER BACK IN,

305
00:13:43,787 --> 00:13:45,322
AND YOU TRY IT
ALL OVER AGAIN.

306
00:13:45,322 --> 00:13:47,458
IT'S ONLY 25 BUCKS A
SHOT FOR THE RAMP, SO...

307
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,194
FINE, THANKS A LOT FOR
YOUR HELP THERE, GLEN.

308
00:13:50,194 --> 00:13:51,929
MY PLEASURE TO BE
OF SERVICE, RED.

309
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:53,597
OH, RED, BY THE WAY,

310
00:13:53,597 --> 00:13:55,866
HOW ARE WE GOING
TO PAY FOR THIS?

311
00:13:55,866 --> 00:13:57,801
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU LEND ME
THE BLOCK AND TACKLE,

312
00:13:57,801 --> 00:14:00,571
AND WE'LL JUST
CALL IT EVEN?

313
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,877
UNCLE RED, WHY DO YOU
THINK KIDS GO BAD?

314
00:14:06,877 --> 00:14:09,280
WELL, MAYBE THEY'VE BEEN
LEFT OUT IN THE SUN
TOO LONG.

315
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,714
NO, I MEAN, LIKE,
YOU KNOW,

316
00:14:10,714 --> 00:14:13,284
DO YOU SUBSCRIBE
TO THE NATURE OR
NURTURE THEORY?

317
00:14:13,284 --> 00:14:16,053
OH, YOU MEAN DO I BLAME
THE KIDS' PARENTS

318
00:14:16,053 --> 00:14:17,688
OR JUST ALL
PARENTS EVERYWHERE?

319
00:14:17,688 --> 00:14:18,956
YEAH, EXACTLY.

320
00:14:18,956 --> 00:14:20,224
WELL, SORT OF
WHAT I MEAN, YEAH,

321
00:14:20,224 --> 00:14:22,993
BECAUSE LIKE NATURE SAYS
WE ARE WHAT WE INHERIT
FROM OUR PARENTS;

322
00:14:22,993 --> 00:14:25,462
WHEREAS, NURTURE SAYS
WE'RE SHAPED BY
SOCIAL FACTORS.

323
00:14:25,462 --> 00:14:27,197
SO IF A KID'S BAD
THEY SAY IT'S NATURE,

324
00:14:27,197 --> 00:14:29,633
OR IF A KID'S BAD
THEY SAY IT'S NURTURE.

325
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:32,036
WELL, I KIND OF GO WITH
THE THEORY OF "NOT YER."

326
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:33,637
NOT YER?

327
00:14:33,637 --> 00:14:35,339
YEAH, IF THERE'S
A PROBLEM WITH A KID,

328
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:37,574
YOU SAY IT'S
NOT YER KID.

329
00:14:37,574 --> 00:14:40,344
UNCLE RED, I WAS HOPING YOU
WOULD TAKE IT A LITTLE MORE
SERIOUSLY THAN THAT.

330
00:14:40,344 --> 00:14:42,079
WELL, IT'S
NOT YER PROBLEM.

331
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,947
IT IS IF I WANT TO DISCUSS
MATTERS OF IMPORTANCE.

332
00:14:43,947 --> 00:14:46,483
IT'S NOT YER SHOW.
OKAY, GOOD POINT.

333
00:14:51,622 --> 00:14:53,791
Red: TIME FOR
ADVENTURES WITH BILL.

334
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:56,293
BILL HAS BEEN UP A TREE
WITH A CHAIN SAW,

335
00:14:56,293 --> 00:14:58,028
WHICH IS APPARENTLY
ONE OF HIS HOBBIES.

336
00:14:58,028 --> 00:15:00,130
HOW ARE YOU
DOING THERE, BILL?

337
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,199
ABOUT THE SAME I GUESS.

338
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:03,801
AND WHAT HE'S GOING
TO SHOW US TODAY

339
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:05,702
IS HOW TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S
KIND OF MIXING ART

340
00:15:05,702 --> 00:15:07,805
WITH THE HANDYMAN THING
OR AN OUTDOORSMAN

341
00:15:07,805 --> 00:15:09,106
OR A LUMBERJACK
WHAT HAVE YOU.

342
00:15:09,106 --> 00:15:12,409
AND THIS IS ACTUALLY
SCULPTING USING A CHAIN SAW.

343
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:15,079
HE'S GOING TO -- I'M NOT SURE
LEAVING A LIT OIL LAMP

344
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:18,549
OUT IN THE WOODS
IS THE GREATEST IDEA.

345
00:15:20,384 --> 00:15:22,386
ALL RIGHT.
NOW HERE'S A SAFETY TIP.

346
00:15:22,386 --> 00:15:25,556
YOU GOT TO PUT YOUR FOOT
ON TOP OF THE CHAIN SAW
WHEN YOU START IT.

347
00:15:25,556 --> 00:15:27,424
YOU KNOW, THAT'S AN
IMPORTANT SAFETY TIP,

348
00:15:27,424 --> 00:15:29,026
ESPECIALLY WITH THE GUY
STANDING BEHIND YOU.

349
00:15:29,026 --> 00:15:32,863
THE OTHER THING
IS WATCH OUT, DON'T --

350
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,566
WELL, THERE'S SO MANY
SAFETY TIPS THERE TODAY

351
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:37,768
IT'S REALLY HARD TO
IDENTIFY ALL OF THEM

352
00:15:37,768 --> 00:15:39,970
WITHOUT BORING OURSELVES
BEYOND HUMAN BELIEF.

353
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,005
ANYWAY, BILL COMES BACK,
GOT THE CHAIN SAW RUNNING.

354
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:45,075
NOW HE'S USING THE ARTIST
LEONARDO DA VINCI
APPROACH THERE.

355
00:15:45,075 --> 00:15:46,677
HE'S KIND OF THUMBING
IT UP, AS WE SAY,

356
00:15:46,677 --> 00:15:48,478
THUMBING IT UP.
YEAH, BILL.

357
00:15:48,478 --> 00:15:50,447
AND HE'S GOING TO TRY TO --

358
00:15:50,447 --> 00:15:53,183
SEEMS LIKE AN AWFUL THING
TO DO TO A TREE, BUT ANYWAY.

359
00:15:53,183 --> 00:15:55,619
BILL IS GOING TO TRY TO --

360
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:57,321
MAYBE I'M STANDING A
LITTLE TOO CLOSE MYSELF.

361
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:59,623
ANOTHER SAFETY TIP THERE.

362
00:15:59,623 --> 00:16:01,858
AND I GUESS THAT WOULD
BE AN OIL LAMP.

363
00:16:01,858 --> 00:16:03,694
BOY.

364
00:16:03,694 --> 00:16:05,229
THAT WILL BURN FOR
A WHILE THERE,

365
00:16:05,229 --> 00:16:06,597
IT'S A PRETTY
GOOD SIZE STUMP.

366
00:16:06,597 --> 00:16:08,398
NOW BILL ASKED ME TO TAKE
THE OIL LAMP AND PUT HER DOWN.

367
00:16:08,398 --> 00:16:11,068
HE'S GOT KIND OF A LITTLE
TOY PARROT THING THERE

368
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:12,836
THAT WILL SIT
UP ON THERE.

369
00:16:12,836 --> 00:16:15,606
I GUESS HE'S GOING TO NOW
TRY TO CARVE US SOMETHING
THAT LOOKS LIKE --

370
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:17,507
IS THAT A PARROT?
YEAH, THAT'S A PARROT.

371
00:16:17,507 --> 00:16:18,942
THAT TREE DOESN'T LOOK MUCH
LIKE A PARROT TO ME,

372
00:16:18,942 --> 00:16:21,144
BUT HE'S THUMBING
HER UP AGAIN.

373
00:16:21,144 --> 00:16:23,480
WHEN IT COMES TO
THUMBING THINGS UP,

374
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,717
BILL IS ABOUT AVERAGE.

375
00:16:26,717 --> 00:16:29,386
EXTRA TWIGS IN THERE MADE
IT A LITTLE SPECIAL.

376
00:16:32,489 --> 00:16:34,458
I'M AN ART CRITIC MYSELF.

377
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,093
YEAH, PERFECT.

378
00:16:36,093 --> 00:16:37,494
NOW HE'S GOT SOMETHING
REAL SPECIAL.

379
00:16:37,494 --> 00:16:39,129
HE WANTS ME TO DO ONE OF
MY MANLY POSES

380
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:41,465
THAT I WAS GOING TO DO IN THE
MR. OUTDOOR UNIVERSE CONTEST

381
00:16:41,465 --> 00:16:43,467
IF I EVER LOOKED GOOD.

382
00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:45,102
AND HE'S TRYING TO PICK A
TREE THAT HE THINKS --

383
00:16:45,102 --> 00:16:48,839
FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER HE
DIDN'T THINK THAT TREE WAS
GOING TO DO IT.

384
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,440
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT
WAS ABOUT THE TREE,

385
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,642
IT LOOKED PERFECTLY
FINE TO ME,

386
00:16:52,642 --> 00:16:55,545
BUT I GUESS HE FELT THIS TREE
HERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE
BIT BETTER.

387
00:16:55,545 --> 00:16:56,913
I DON'T KNOW.

388
00:16:56,913 --> 00:16:58,749
SOMETHING ABOUT IT --
OH I SEE.

389
00:16:58,749 --> 00:17:00,183
ALL RIGHT.

390
00:17:00,183 --> 00:17:01,918
SO ANYWAY, HE'S CUTTING
AWAY THERE.

391
00:17:01,918 --> 00:17:04,588
AND AS HE STARTED -- I THINK
HE STARTED WITH THE
TORSO ON THAT.

392
00:17:04,588 --> 00:17:08,258
BOY, YOU CAN GENERATE QUITE
A FEW WOOD SHAVINGS AND SMOKE.

393
00:17:08,258 --> 00:17:10,794
SOMETIMES IF YOU
OIL THE CHAIN SAWS,

394
00:17:10,794 --> 00:17:12,562
THEY DON'T HEAT UP
QUITE SO BAD.

395
00:17:12,562 --> 00:17:14,598
THERE HE GOES.
HE GOT HER ALL DONE.

396
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:16,233
I BELIEVE THAT'S JUST
THE SHAVINGS.

397
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:17,734
NOW HE'S --
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

398
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:19,136
HE WANTS TO SHOW ME
WHAT HE'S DONE.

399
00:17:19,136 --> 00:17:20,670
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THIS.

400
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,606
THAT'S A PRETTY
AGGRESSIVE AMBITION.

401
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:25,809
HOLY MACKEREL!
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS, BILL!

402
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:27,777
NO, NO, I CAN'T FOOL YOU,
THIS ISN'T THE SCULPTURE.

403
00:17:27,777 --> 00:17:30,313
THIS IS WAYNE FRASER,
WINNER OF THE VERY FIRST

404
00:17:30,313 --> 00:17:32,549
RED GREEN
LOOK-A-LIKE CONTEST.

405
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:34,084
Red: STAY TUNED.

406
00:17:34,084 --> 00:17:36,119
WINSTON HAS GOT ONE OF HIS
DARNED SELF-HELP TAPES FOR YOU

407
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:38,421
AND THE BOYS AND I ARE GOING
TO TRY AND HOIST A FEW.

408
00:17:42,826 --> 00:17:45,428
"WINTER SURPRISE," BY ME.

409
00:17:45,428 --> 00:17:48,431
"I TOBOGGAN IN THE WINTER
COLD THE WHOLE AFTERNOON,

410
00:17:48,431 --> 00:17:51,468
"THEN I STAGGER INDOORS TO
THE WARMTH OF THE FIRE.

411
00:17:51,468 --> 00:17:54,504
"AS I PEEL OFF MY
PARKA AND BOOTS,

412
00:17:54,504 --> 00:17:58,942
"A WHITE FROZEN LUMP FALLS OUT
OF MY TOQUE AND SKITTERS
ACROSS THE FLOOR.

413
00:17:58,942 --> 00:18:01,511
"IS IT A SNOWBALL?
A LUMP OF ICE?

414
00:18:01,511 --> 00:18:03,146
"A PINE CONE?

415
00:18:03,146 --> 00:18:05,682
"ONLY, NO,
IT'S MY LEFT EAR.

416
00:18:05,682 --> 00:18:09,286
"I FEEL I SHOULD
GO PAINT SOMETHING.

417
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:11,321
"PERHAPS THE SHED."

418
00:18:18,161 --> 00:18:21,031
THE EARTH IS AN
AMAZING THING, ISN'T IT?

419
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:24,868
OUT THERE IN THE FOREST IS A
PATCH OF MUD CAN'T BE MORE
THAN FIVE FEET ACROSS,

420
00:18:24,868 --> 00:18:26,670
AND WE'VE GOT 17 VEHICLES,

421
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,973
NINE POWER TOOLS AND A
MULE STUCK IN IT.

422
00:18:29,973 --> 00:18:32,375
AND COUNTING.

423
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,344
NO, NO, HAROLD,
WE'RE GETTING
SERIOUS NOW.

424
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:36,646
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS
POWER WINCH OUT THERE,

425
00:18:36,646 --> 00:18:39,783
HOOK HER UP TO THE BIG OAK
TREE ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE STREET

426
00:18:39,783 --> 00:18:41,885
AND JUST WINCH EVERYTHING
OUT OF THERE.

427
00:18:41,885 --> 00:18:44,154
UNCLE RED, THAT IS SUCH
A FALSE ECONOMY.

428
00:18:44,154 --> 00:18:46,589
I MEAN, FOR 5 BUCKS FLINTY
WOULD HAVE COME AND STARTED
STINKY'S CAR,

429
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:48,124
AND THE WHOLE THING WOULD
HAVE BEEN DONE WITH,

430
00:18:48,124 --> 00:18:50,460
BUT INSTEAD LOOK AT ALL
THE MONEY YOU'VE SQUANDERED.

431
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,495
WE HAVE SQUANDERED
ZERO, HAROLD.

432
00:18:52,495 --> 00:18:54,464
EVERYBODY PROVIDED
THEIR OWN VEHICLES,

433
00:18:54,464 --> 00:18:56,633
AND WE ALL OWN THE TOOLS
AND THE MULE WAS STOLEN,

434
00:18:56,633 --> 00:18:59,169
WHERE'S THE FALSE ECONOMY?

435
00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:01,504
OKAY, WELL, ALL RIGHT,
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE GAS
YOU BURNED?

436
00:19:01,504 --> 00:19:03,039
AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR TIME?
WHAT IS YOUR TIME WORTH?

437
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,142
WHAT DOES A PROFESSIONAL
INCOMPETENT CHARGE?

438
00:19:07,177 --> 00:19:08,511
ZERO, HAROLD.

439
00:19:08,511 --> 00:19:09,913
WE DON'T CHARGE PEOPLE
FOR HAVING FUN.

440
00:19:09,913 --> 00:19:13,249
THAT'S A MUCH OLDER
PROFESSION THAN ANY
OF OURS.

441
00:19:13,249 --> 00:19:14,617
BUT STILL, BUT STILL,

442
00:19:14,617 --> 00:19:17,520
STINKY COULD HAVE HAD THE
TRABANT GOING FOR 5 BUCKS.

443
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,790
STINKY CAN REPLACE
THE TRABANT FOR 5 BUCKS.

444
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,960
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
YOU CANNOT BUY A NEW
TRABANT FOR $5.

445
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,096
YOU CAN BUY STINKY'S AS IS,
WHERE IS, HOW IS.

446
00:19:27,096 --> 00:19:29,632
NO CHANCE IS.

447
00:19:29,632 --> 00:19:31,401
WELL, THEN FINE,
EXCUSE ME,

448
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:34,370
I GOT AN APPOINTMENT
WITH A BIG OAK TREE.

449
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,707
UNCLE RED, THAT'S WHAT
THE BATHROOM'S FOR.

450
00:19:37,707 --> 00:19:39,943
I'LL TELL YOU, WINSTON,
WITH THE POWER IN THIS RIG,

451
00:19:39,943 --> 00:19:42,245
WE'LL HAVE EVERYBODY OUT
OF THE DITCH AND HOME
FOR SUPPER.

452
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:43,213
LET'S GO.

453
00:19:43,213 --> 00:19:45,715
RED... I CAN'T.

454
00:19:45,715 --> 00:19:47,283
WHAT, DID YOU LOSE
THE KEYS?

455
00:19:47,283 --> 00:19:49,118
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
I KNOW HOW TO HOT-WIRE
THESE THINGS.

456
00:19:49,118 --> 00:19:50,820
RED, WE CAN'T USE
THE TRUCK.

457
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,989
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

458
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:55,692
WHEN I BROKE INTO
THIS SLUDGE SUCKING
BUSINESS, RED,

459
00:19:55,692 --> 00:19:58,695
I MADE MYSELF ONE PROMISE.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
PROMISE WAS?

460
00:19:58,695 --> 00:20:01,197
ALWAYS WASH YOUR HANDS
BEFORE LUNCH?

461
00:20:01,197 --> 00:20:02,665
NO.

462
00:20:02,665 --> 00:20:06,269
I JUST MADE A PROMISE TO
MYSELF TO ONLY USE THIS
TRUCK TO MAKE MONEY.

463
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:08,871
YOU MAY FIND THIS
HARD TO BELIEVE,

464
00:20:08,871 --> 00:20:11,808
BUT I HAVE NEVER ONCE USED
THIS TRUCK FOR PLEASURE,

465
00:20:11,808 --> 00:20:13,543
JUST BUSINESS.

466
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:16,112
SO YOU WON'T HELP
A FRIEND IN NEED?

467
00:20:16,112 --> 00:20:19,015
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT
ANTHONY ANTHONY SAYS
ABOUT THAT, EH?

468
00:20:19,015 --> 00:20:22,352
OH MAN, NOT THAT SUCCEED
THROUGH SUCCESS BOZO ON
T.V. AT NIGHT.

469
00:20:22,352 --> 00:20:24,053
HEY, WAIT
A MINUTE, RED,

470
00:20:24,053 --> 00:20:27,390
ANTHONY ANTHONY JUST HAPPENS
TO BE FINANCIAL ADVISOR
TO FLORENCE HENDERSON,

471
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:32,595
GAVIN McLEOD AND A
HOST OF OTHER IMPORTANT
HOLLYWOOD CELEBRITIES

472
00:20:32,595 --> 00:20:37,333
WHO JUST LOVE TO POP IN
ON HIS INFOMERCIALS
AND SAY HELLO.

473
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,268
YOU KNOW
WHAT HE SAYS, EH?

474
00:20:39,268 --> 00:20:42,605
HE SAYS THAT A FRIEND
IN NEED IS A CUSTOMER.

475
00:20:42,605 --> 00:20:43,940
YOU GOT TO HEAR IT,
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

476
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,641
I'M NOT GOING
TO LISTEN TO THAT.

477
00:20:47,877 --> 00:20:50,580
SO WHAT DOES ANTHONY ANTHONY
HAVE TO SAY ABOUT PUBLIC
RELATIONS

478
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,915
AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT?

479
00:20:52,915 --> 00:20:55,551
I DON'T KNOW, IT WAS ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF
THAT TAPE.

480
00:20:55,551 --> 00:20:57,987
I WAS GOING TO LISTEN
TO IT TONIGHT.

481
00:21:03,626 --> 00:21:05,795
HOLY.

482
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:13,603
WELL, I GOT TO TELL YOU,
A BLOCK AND TACKLE IS
ONE POWERFUL TOOL.

483
00:21:13,603 --> 00:21:15,438
DID YOU GET ALL THE
VEHICLES OUT OF THE MUD?

484
00:21:15,438 --> 00:21:17,874
DON'T GET AHEAD
OF ME, HAROLD.

485
00:21:17,874 --> 00:21:21,511
WE HOOKED EVERYTHING UP TO
THE BIG OAK TREE ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE ROAD THERE,

486
00:21:21,511 --> 00:21:22,979
AND WE STARTED
WINCHING IT.

487
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:24,514
WE WINCHED AND WE WINCHED
AND WE WINCHED,

488
00:21:24,514 --> 00:21:26,382
AND NOT ONE VEHICLE MOVED.

489
00:21:26,382 --> 00:21:28,818
WELL, THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE,
SOMETHING HAD TO HAVE MOVED.

490
00:21:28,818 --> 00:21:30,119
YOU'RE RIGHT, HAROLD.

491
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:32,955
THE OAK TREE COME RIGHT
ACROSS THE ROAD,

492
00:21:32,955 --> 00:21:35,925
ROOT BALL AND ALL.

493
00:21:35,925 --> 00:21:38,261
SO THEN WE FIGURED, GEE,
IF WE HAD ENOUGH EXTRA CHAIN,

494
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:41,130
WE COULD PROBABLY
HOOK THE WHOLE RIG UP TO
BUSTER HADFIELD'S HOUSE.

495
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,465
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

496
00:21:42,465 --> 00:21:44,967
BUSTER HADFIELD'S HOUSE IS
QUITE A DISTANCE FROM
THAT FOREST.

497
00:21:44,967 --> 00:21:47,103
NOT ANYMORE.

498
00:21:49,071 --> 00:21:50,706
NO, BY THE TIME WE
GOT DONE WITH HER,

499
00:21:50,706 --> 00:21:52,708
HIS HOUSE WAS RIGHT IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE VEHICLES.

500
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:56,012
LOOKED GOOD TOO, THE CAR AND
TRUCKS ARE KIND OF LIKE
LAWN ORNAMENTS THERE.

501
00:21:56,012 --> 00:21:58,247
OF COURSE, HE HAD THE
BIG OAK, WHICH IS NICE.

502
00:21:58,247 --> 00:22:00,149
UNCLE RED, IT'S OKAY TO
DAMAGE YOUR OWN JUNK,

503
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:05,388
BUT YOU GOT TO REPLACE
EVERYTHING ELSE.

504
00:22:05,388 --> 00:22:08,891
TO LIFT EVERYTHING BACK
TO WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO.

505
00:22:08,891 --> 00:22:11,027
OHHHHHH.

506
00:22:11,027 --> 00:22:13,496
WELL, ISN'T IT LUCKY THAT
YOU DIDN'T PHONE EARLIER?

507
00:22:13,496 --> 00:22:17,333
HE WOULD HAVE MADE A MERE $5
REMOVING JUST THE ONE VEHICLE.

508
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:21,504
YEAH, HE FIGURES HE'S
GOING TO MAKE ENOUGH MONEY
TO PAY FOR THE WEDDING.

509
00:22:21,504 --> 00:22:23,906
WEDDING?

510
00:22:23,906 --> 00:22:26,642
HE'S GOING TO MARRY STINKY'S
GIRLFRIEND, RIGHT?

511
00:22:26,642 --> 00:22:29,445
WELL, WE DON'T CALL HER
STINKY'S GIRLFRIEND ANYMORE.

512
00:22:29,445 --> 00:22:33,516
WE CALL HER FLINTY'S
FIANCéE NOW.

513
00:22:33,516 --> 00:22:35,117
SO LET ME JUST SEE THEN.

514
00:22:35,117 --> 00:22:37,219
SO WHAT STINKY HAS TO
SHOW FOR HIS FOOLISH PRIDE

515
00:22:37,219 --> 00:22:39,822
IS MERELY A MUD COVERED
BROKEN DOWN TRABANT.

516
00:22:39,822 --> 00:22:43,559
NO, NOT EVEN THAT.
HE'S GIVING HER THAT
FOR A WEDDING PRESENT,

517
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,261
SO HE'S GETTING SOME
REVENGE IN THERE.

[ POSSUM SQUEALING ]
OH, IT'S MEETING
TIME, UNCLE RED.

519

YEAH, YOU GO AHEAD,
HAROLD.

520
00:22:49,398 --> 00:22:51,500
I'LL BE DOWN AFTER I
GET CLEANED UP.
OKAY.

IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

522
00:22:53,235 --> 00:22:55,104
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT
HOME AFTER THE MEETING.

523
00:22:55,104 --> 00:22:58,340
AND YOU KNOW HOW YOU ALWAYS
WANTED THAT MUD ROOM?

524
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,410
WELL, I THINK TONIGHT'S
YOUR LUCKY NIGHT.

525
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,547
HOPEFULLY,
IT WILL BE MINE TOO.

AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.
