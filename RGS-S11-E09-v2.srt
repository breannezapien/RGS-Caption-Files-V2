1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,370
YOU KNOW, ON A
BEAUTIFUL WEEKEND DAY

2
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:04,738
IN THE MIDDLE
OF TROUT SEASON,

3
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:06,272
THE LAST THING
YOU WANNA BE DOING

4
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:08,208
IS PAINTING THE
INSIDE OF YOUR HOUSE.

5
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:11,711
WELL, LET'S SAY YOUR
SIGNIFICANT OTHER ASKS
YOU TO PAINT THE FRONT ROOM.

6
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:15,148
INSTEAD OF WHINING
OR HIDING OR FAKING A HERNIA,

7
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:17,717
WHY DON'T YOU USE IT AS
A LEARNING EXPERIENCE?

8
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:20,453
YOU'LL LEARN THAT
THERE ARE OVER 75 SHADES

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,455
OF GREEN PAINT.

10
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,291
YOU'LL ALSO DISCOVER THAT
TWO SHEETS OF NEWSPAPER

11
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,794
COVERS THE AVERAGE
SIZE WINDOW.

12
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,230
AND YOU'LL SEE THE BENEFIT OF
THROWING YOUR DIRTY LAUNDRY

13
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:33,033
ON THE FLOOR ALL THESE YEARS.

14
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,468
YOU'LL ALSO FIND OUT
THAT IF YOU'RE OVER 55,

15
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,670
THERE'S A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE
THAT YOUR PYJAMA BOTTOMS

16
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:41,408
ARE LARGE ENOUGH TO FIT
OVER A STANDARD FLOOR LAMP.

17
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:45,445
NOW, I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW WHAT
A PAINT SPRAYER LOOKS LIKE.

18
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:47,914
BUT YOU PROBABLY DON'T REALISE
THAT THE HOSE FITTINGS

19
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:51,684
ARE THE SAME SIZE AS THE
ONES ON YOUR LAWN SPRINKLER.

20
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:54,087
OKAY, YOU'RE ALSO
GONNA FIND OUT

21
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:57,057
THAT YOU WANNA GET OUTTA
HERE BEFORE THE LATEX
HITS THE WALL.

22
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,564
AND NOW, IF YOU'LL BE KIND
ENOUGH TO EXCUSE ME,

23
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,199
I'VE GOT SOME
PAINTING TO DO.

24
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:09,369
[paint sprayer whirring]

25
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,706
[sprayer stops]

26
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,208
NOW THE SECOND COAT.

27
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,277
[paint sprayer whirring]

28
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:23,516
THEN WHILE YOU'RE WAITING
FOR THE PAINT TO DRY,

29
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,351
YOU CAN GO CALL A FEW
BUDDIES AND BRAG TO THEM

30
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:27,020
ABOUT HOW SMART YOU ARE.

31
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:33,593
[cheering and applause]

32
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,438
[chuckling]

33
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,540
[ CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
CONTINUES ]

34
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:48,775
[chuckling]

35
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,110
OKAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

36
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,778
NO, I APPRECIATE THAT.

37
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,780
I GUESS YOU KNOW THAT
THIS IS THE BIG WEEKEND,

38
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:56,683
THE SECOND ANNUAL CHAIN SAW
RACES UP HERE.

39
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,952
WE MOUNT THE CHAIN SAWS ONTO
SKATEBOARDS LIKE THIS,

40
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:02,322
AND BOY, DO THESE
BABIES EVER MOVE.

41
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,324
YOU TAPE THAT
THROTTLE WIDE OPEN,

42
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,426
THIS THING TAKES OFF ON YOU.

43
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,695
ZERO TO 60 IN UNDER
FIVE SECONDS.

44
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:11,097
EVEN FASTER IF YOU
REMEMBER TO LET GO.

45
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,633
AND TALK ABOUT
A CROWD PLEASER.

46
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,502
WE COULD HAVE CHAIN SAW
RACES EVERY MONTH,

47
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:18,204
IF PEOPLE WOULD HEAL FASTER.

48
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:19,906
UNCLE RED!
UNCLE RED!

49
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,774
[cheering and applause]

50
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:24,377
THEY'RE EXCITED.
THEY'RE EXCITED, HAROLD.

51
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,279
ARE YOU COMING OUT
TO MEET THE BUS?

52
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,447
BUS?
WHAT BUS?

53
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,916
THE BUS FOR THE INTELLECTUALLY
GIFTED CHILDREN'S CLUB.

54
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,217
YEAH,
WHAT?

55
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,986
THEY BOOKED THE LODGE
FOR THE ENTIRE WEEKEND.

56
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:36,122
LOOK, SEE, IT'S RIGHT
HERE IN MY PALM PILOT.

57
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,291
WELL, UH,

58
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,293
LET ME CHECK
MY PALM PILOT.

59
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:43,796
OH, YEAH, HERE IT IS.

60
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,965
SO WHAT?

61
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:47,267
I CAN'T MEET THE
BUS, HAROLD.

62
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,602
I GOTTA WORK ON MY
CHAIN SAW FOR THE RACES.

63
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:52,739
OH! WE GOT A WHOLE PROGRAMME
PLANNED FOR THESE
SPECIAL KIDS.

64
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:54,274
OH, YEAH?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

65
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:57,143
NO!
YOUR POCKET PROTECTORS?
CLEAN AND RELOAD

66
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,013
BUT WE HAVE
VEGETABLE CLONING.

67
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:02,916
YES, AND WARHAMMER ACTION
FIGURE PAINTING CLASSES.

68
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,718
AND A CHANCE TO DRESS UP AS
YOUR VERY FAVOURITE ALIEN
"STAR TREK" CHARACTER,

69
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:08,321
WHICH IS SO COOL!

70
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:09,856
WHAT?
SHOULD DO, HAROLD?
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU

71
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,858
YOU SHOULD BRING THE KIDS
TO THE CHAIN SAW RACES.

72
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,326
OH, YEAH. YEAH.
NO, NO, NO.

73
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,427
HUH?
NO, NO.

74
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,162
NO, IT'S JUST THAT PEOPLE
WHO ARE VERY INTELLIGENT

75
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,531
HAVE LOW
PAIN THRESHOLDS.

76
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,433
WELL, THE SPECTATORS WILL
BE PERFECTLY SAFE, HAROLD.

77
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,469
I MEAN, WE'RE HOLDING IT UP
IN THE DRY RIVER BED UP AT
ROCK REEF POINT THERE.

78
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,472
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO
CHANCE THAT ANYBODY'S
GONNA GET HURT.

79
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,708
[chain saw rewing]

80
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:43,489
IT'S TIME FOR THE
POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

81
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:46,960
[cheering and applause]

82
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,935
TONIGHT'S WINNER GETS A
COPY OF MY BRAND NEW BOOK.

83
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,671
NOW, THIS IF FOR PEOPLE WHO
FIND THE "FOR DUMMIES" BOOK

84
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,441
A LITTLE TOO COMPLICATED.

85
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:04,811
"DRESSING YOURSELF
FOR UTTER MORONS."

86
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:09,515
AH! NUMBER FOUR...

87
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,688
OKAY, DALTON,
COVER YOUR EARS.

88
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,224
RED, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS TO
GET DALTON TO SAY THIS WORD...

89
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,529
YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
WINSTON.

90
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,064
AND GO!

91
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,066
OKAY, DALTON, YOU SET
YOUR ALARM CLOCK

92
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,334
BECAUSE YOU
WANNA WAKE UP...

93
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,770
IRRITABLE.

94
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,972
OKAY, IF YOU'RE
NOT LATE, YOU ARE...

95
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,475
STILL ALIVE!

96
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:36,776
NO. NO.

97
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:39,345
OKAY, WHICH BIRD
GETS THE WORM?

98
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,514
THE BIG, MEAN ONE?

99
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:42,782
ALMOST OUTTA TIME, GUYS.

100
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,317
ALL RIGHT, UM,
OKAY.

101
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,453
DALTON, WHAT MAKES A MAN
HEALTHY, WEALTHY AND WISE?

102
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,956
DO I LOOK LIKE I KNOW?

103
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,991
NO, BUT YOU DO KNOW.

104
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:55,194
SOMETHING TO BED;
SOMETHING TO RISE.

105
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,897
NO! NO! NO!

106
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,900
ALL RIGHT, NO.
NO. NO. NO.

107
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,603
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU
GO TO A PARTY,

108
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,571
AND YOU GET THERE BEFORE
YOU SHOULD, YOU ARE...

109
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,473
ALONE.

110
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:09,809
HOW DO YOU FIGURE ALONE?

111
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,011
BECAUSE IF I TAKE ANN MARIE,
I NEVER GET ANYWHERE EARLY.

112
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,113
THERE IT IS!

113
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,948
[applause]

114
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,389
[music blaring]

115
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,958
THAT'S THE FUTURE OF
OUR COUNTRY RIGHT THERE.

116
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,262
FIFTEEN HORSEPOWER CAR
WITH A 300 HORSEPOWER RADIO.

117
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,197
AND THE MUSIC'S TERRIBLE.

118
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,799
'COURSE, THAT'S WHY
THEY PLAY IT SO LOUD,

119
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:35,535
BECAUSE THEY KNOW YOU'D
NEVER LISTEN TO IT IF
YOU HAD A CHOICE.

120
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,737
NOW, I KNOW AS YOU GET OLDER
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO MATURE,

121
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,340
ACCEPT THINGS AROUND YOU
AND JUST KEEP QUIET.

122
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,175
TO ME, THAT MEANS
EVERYBODY IN THE CEMETERY

123
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,243
IS ABOUT AS MATURE
AS YOU CAN GET.

124
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,145
I PREFER TO STAY CHILDISH.

125
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,215
SO THIS TIME
ON HANDYMAN CORNER,

126
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,017
I'M GONNA STRIKE BACK
BY TURNING THIS VAN

127
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,686
INTO THE WORLD'S
LARGEST BOOM BOX.

128
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,189
NOW, THEY DON'T BUILD THE
SIZE OF SPEAKER I HAD IN MIND,

129
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,890
SO I HAVE TO MAKE MY OWN.

130
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,792
HOW HARD CAN IT BE?

131
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,794
FOR STARTERS, I'LL NEED
A REAL BIG MAGNET

132
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,529
TO PUT ON THE BACK
OF MY SPEAKER.

133
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:07,800
SO I TOOK EVERY FRIDGE MAGNET
ANYONE HAD EVER GIVEN ME,

134
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:11,104
AND I PUT 'EM INTO
THIS METAL BUCKET.

135
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,739
THEY'RE FROM INSURANCE GUYS,

136
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,507
PIZZA DELIVERY PLACES,

137
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,478
RELIGIOUS FANATICAL GROUPS.

138
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,246
BOY, THAT'S A
STRONG MAGNET.

139
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,818
OKAY, PERFECT.

140
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,520
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT
WHERE I WANTED IT.

141
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,155
THAT SAVED ME A LITTLE TIME.

142
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,193
HMM.
OKAY.

143
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,797
NOW, TO MAKE THE
CONE FOR MY SPEAKER,

144
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,533
I'M GONNA USE ONE OF THESE
KIDDIE SWIMMING POOLS.

145
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,168
JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE
TO INFLATE THIS, WILL YOU?

146
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,388
THERE WE GO.

147
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,491
COME, EH.
WE MADE A FAIR TRADE.

148
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,493
A DEAL'S A DEAL.

149
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,029
THERE YOU GO.

150
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,569
OKAY, THIS IS WHERE IT
GETS A LITTLE BIT TRICKY.

151
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,938
YOU GOTTA MAKE
AN ELECTROMAGNET ON
THE BACK OF YOUR POOL

152
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,773
THAT'LL FIT OVER THE
BUCKET OF FRIDGE MAGNETS,

153
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,543
AND YOU GOTTA DO ALL THIS
WITHOUT GOING OVER BUDGET.

154
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,411
SO I'M JUST USING
THIS OLD GARBAGE PAIL

155
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,079
BECAUSE I DON'T NEED
THIS UNTIL GARBAGE DAY.

156
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:28,714
AND I FIGURE BY THEN
THIS WHOLE PROJECT

157
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:31,050
WILL BE A DISTANT,
PAINFUL MEMORY.

158
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,718
THEN WITH THE ELECTROMAGNET
PART, ALL I'M DOING

159
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,855
IS WINDING THIS STRING OF
CHRISTMAS LIGHTS AROUND
THE OUTSIDE.

160
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,591
THESE ALL FELL OFF THE ROOF
DURING THAT BIG STORM
LAST JULY.

161
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,431
OKAY, I'M GONNA NEED SOME REAL
WATTAGE TO DRIVE THIS BABY,

162
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:48,067
SO HERE'S WHAT I DID.

163
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,736
I TOOK ALL THE AMPLIFIERS
OUT OF A BUNCH OF OLD
RADIOS I HAVE --

164
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,005
YOU KNOW, IN THE GARAGE,
DOWN IN THE BASEMENT,
IN THE ATTIC --

165
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:56,676
WIRED THEM ALL
TOGETHER IN SERIES.

166
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:00,546
I'VE PROBABLY GOT A TRILLION
GIGAWATTS OF POWER HERE.

167
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,381
IF IT DOESN'T
WORK OUT AS A RADIO,

168
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,484
IT'LL MAKE A DANDY
WELDER, HUH?

169
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,219
OF COURSE, I'M NOT
GONNA HAVE ANY MUSIC

170
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,120
UNTIL I TURN ON THE VAN RADIO.

171
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,956
BUT I STILL GOTTA
HOOK UP THE SPEAKER,

172
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,858
MAKE SURE THE POWER'S
GETTING THROUGH, YOU KNOW.

173
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,430
YEAH! I'M GOOD.
NO, THAT'S --

174
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,664
THAT'S ALL GOOD.

175
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,533
OKAY, NOW I JUST GOTTA
CRANK THE VOLUME ON HER.

176
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:27,673
OKAY, WE'RE READY TO ROCK.

177
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,710
SO REMEMBER,

178
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,445
IF THE WOMEN DON'T
FIND YOU HANDSOME --

179
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,614
OH, BABY.

180
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,349
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

181
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,150
[laughing]

182
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:41,521
[music blaring]

183
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:59,038
[music blasting]

184
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:14,487
[cheering and applause]

185
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,096
YOU KNOW,
AFTER YOU GET MARRIED,

186
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,266
THERE ARE THINGS YOU NEED TO
LEARN THAT NOBODY EVER
TALKS ABOUT.

187
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,868
THEY'RE NOT IN ANY MANUAL,

188
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,671
AND NEITHER YOUR PARENTS NOR
YOUR TEACHERS ARE EVER
GOING TO MENTION THEM.

189
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,706
SO I GUESS IT'S MY JOB.

190
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,308
OKAY, HERE'S THE MAIN ONE...

191
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,410
TO SURVIVE AS A
HAPPILY MARRIED MAN,

192
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:40,046
YOU HAVE TO LEARN
HOW TO SNEAK FOOD.

193
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:46,252
YOU GOTTA PRETEND THAT
WHEN YOU'RE GETTING OUT OF BED
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

194
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:50,156
IT'S BECAUSE YOU HEARD A
CLUNKING SOUND COMING
FROM THE BASEMENT,

195
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,991
NOT BECAUSE YOU HEARD A
GRUMBLING SOUND

196
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,226
COMING FROM YOUR
OWN STOMACH.

197
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,963
YOU GOTTA BE ABLE TO FIND
THE KITCHEN IN THE DARK.

198
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,965
YOU GOTTA BE ABLE
TO UNPLUG THE FRIDGE

199
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:01,701
SO THAT WHEN YOU OPEN
THE DOOR, THE LIGHT
DOESN'T COME ON.

200
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,905
YOU GOTTA EAT
THE FOOD REAL FAST.

201
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,774
AND WHEN YOUR WIFE CALLS DOWN
TO FIND OUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

202
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:12,311
YOU GOTTA BE ABLE TO STUFF
IT ALL INTO ONE CHEEK

203
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,814
SO THAT YOU CAN ANSWER HER
WITHOUT THE TELLTALE SOUND

204
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,817
OF A MOUTHFUL OF
COLD LASAGNA.

205
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,953
THEN WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED,
YOU'VE GOTTA BE ABLE TO
HIDE ALL THE EVIDENCE

206
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,588
AND CLIMB BACK INTO BED.

207
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,423
AND IF SHE STARTS MAKING
ADVANCES TOWARD YOU,

208
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,459
DON'T GIVE IN TO HER.

209
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,160
SHE'S NOT FEELING ROMANTIC;

210
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,096
SHE'S TRYING TO FRISK
YOU FOR TWINKIES.

211
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,732
REMEMBER I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

212
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,533
WE'RE ALL IN
THIS TOGETHER.

213
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,769
[applause]

214
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,905
[siren blaring]

215
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,412
MAN, WHAT'S
THIS ABOUT?

216
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,880
WERE YOU SPEEDING?

217
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,883
SPEEDING?
IN THE POSSUM VAN, DALTON?

218
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,252
I LEFT MY WALLET
AT HOME.

219
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,954
I'VE GOT NO 
DRIVER'S LICENSE.
 

220
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,156
OKAY.
SWITCH PLACES WITH ME.
QUICK, DALTON.
 

221
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,392
[grumbling]

222
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,396
ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE GOOD.

223
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:04,730
IS THAT A
GOOD IDEA?

224
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,232
I THINK DALTON'S
BEEN DRINKING.

225
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:07,566
I HAVE NOT, MIKE.

226
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,670
REALLY?
YOU MEAN HE ACTS
THIS WAY ALL THE TIME?

227
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,204
JUST GET YOUR
LICENSE OUT, DALTON.

228
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,407
UP HERE ANY SECOND.
THE COP'LL BE
NO PROBLEM.

229
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,409
WHAT'S TAKING HIM
SO LONG ANYWAY?

230
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,944
HE'S PROBABLY
RUNNING A CHECK ON
THE LICENSE PLATES.

231
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,881
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

232
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,916
HEY, WHAT'S TODAY'S DATE?

233
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:25,785
THE 14th.

234
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,687
YOU KNOW, I THINK
MY LICENSE IS EXPIRED,

235
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:30,356
UNLESS IT'S STILL 1997.

236
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,224
NO, THAT WAS
YEARS AGO, DALTON.

237
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:35,428
ALTHOUGH, YOUR
WARDROBE IMPLIES 1962.

238
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,563
WELL, WHAT DO WE
DO NOW, GUYS?

239
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,799
HEY, I GOT A LICENSE.
LET ME DRIVE.

240
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,400
ALL RIGHT.

241
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,370
[grumbling]

242
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,177
GET OVER THERE.
GET OVER THERE!

243
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,678
OH!

244
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,117
OKAY, WE'RE FINE.
WE'RE FINE.

245
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,752
IT'LL BE SMOOTH SAILING
FROM HERE ON.

246
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,287
JUST LET ME
DO THE TALKING, OKAY?

247
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,755
LET ME SEE YOUR
LICENSE, MIKE.

248
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,724
YEAH, SURE.

249
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,426
JéSUS RODRIGUEZ?

250
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,462
IT WAS MY MAIDEN NAME.

251
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:11,964
HELLO, POLICE?

252
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,632
I'D LIKE TO REPORT
A ROBBERY IN PROGRESS

253
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,268
AT THE MAIN INTERSECTION
OF PORT ASBESTOS.

254
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,770
UH-UH, MY NAME?

255
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,071
UM --

256
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,774
UH, JéSUS RODRIGUEZ!

257
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,281
[ tires squealing,
siren blaring]

00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,454
[chain saw]

260
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:44,196
BOY, THIS THING'S
RUNNING GREAT.

261
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,932
UNCLE RED --

262
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:48,501
UNCLE RED,
I HAVE A PROBLEM.

263
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,003
WELL, WE'RE ALL
AWARE OF THAT, HAROLD.

264
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,839
I CANNOT DO MY JOB AS
PROMOTIONS MANAGER OF
THE POSSUM LAKE AREA

265
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,876
IF YOU CONTINUE TO STAGE
THESE DANGEROUS EVENTS,

266
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,577
LIKE THE
CHAIN SAW RACING.

267
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,713
YOU'RE FORCING ME
TO PULL RANK.

268
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,515
NOW, HAROLD, WAIT A SECOND.

269
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,283
YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME
YOU'RE PUTTING YOUR JOB

270
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,951
ABOVE THE WISHES
OF THE LODGE, ARE YOU?

271
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,687
I'M NOT, BUT I'VE HAD A BUS
LOAD OF GIFTED CHILDREN
PUT INTO MY CARE,

272
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:12,158
SO I'M PUTTING THEIR SAFETY
ABOVE THE WISHES OF THE LODGE!

273
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,827
OKAY, I KNOW YOU
FEEL THAT WAY,

274
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,462
BUT I BETCHA
THE KIDS DON'T.

275
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,331
OH-H!
I KNEW YOU WERE
GONNA SAY THAT.

276
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,033
I KNEW YOU WERE
GONNA SAY THAT.

277
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:22,735
YEAH. ALL RIGHT.
GONNA SAY THAT.
I KNEW YOU WERE

278
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,638
THORNTON! THORNTON!
COME ON IN HERE.

279
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,345
WELL, LOOKS LIKE THE
VEGETABLE CLONING WORKED.

280
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,790
ARE YOU THE MAN RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS IRRESPONSIBLE

281
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,992
AND SOPHOMORIC EXHIBITION?

282
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,994
WHAT?

283
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,996
HE'S TALKING ABOUT
THE CHAIN SAW RACES.

284
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,865
IT SETS A VERY POOR
EXAMPLE FOR TODAY'S YOUTH,

285
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,768
WATCHING GROWN MEN TEARING
DOWN TREES AND POLLUTING
THE ENVIRONMENT.

286
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,408
I HOPE YOU'RE SOAKING
HIS PARENTS FOR THIS
WEEKEND, HAROLD.

287
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,076
DO NOT BE MEAN,
UNCLE RED.

288
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,878
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR
PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT
INTELLECTUAL LEVELS

289
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,646
TO COMMUNICATE.

290
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,617
WELL, WE'VE PROVEN THAT FOR
YEARS, HAVEN'T WE, EH?

291
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:15,187
THORNTON.
SOMETHING, THORN.
SO TELL ME

292
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,755
THORNTON.
EXCUSE ME.

293
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:19,992
OKAY, YOU'RE A KID, YOU
MUST SEE THE FUN SIDE OF
CHAIN SAW RACES, EH?

294
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,894
MAYBE A FEW YEARS AGO
I MIGHT HAVE.

295
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,596
OH, YEAH?

296
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,465
BUT YOU CAN'T JUSTIFY
ENDANGERING YOUR PEERS
AND DESTROYING THE OZONE

297
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,102
ALL FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR
OWN CHILDISH AMUSEMENT.

298
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,004
[ LAUGHTER AND
SCATTERED APPLAUSE ]

299
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:40,212
WE'RE GOOD.
THAT'S OKAY.

300
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,848
Red Green: A BUNCH OF 
US DECIDED TO BUILD A
 
LITTLE CHILDREN'S AREA

301
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,483
OUT BEHIND THE LODGE THERE. 

302
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,619
HAD A LITTLE WADING POOL. 
PUTTING A SCREEN
 
AROUND THAT.

303
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,588
JUST KINDA MAKE IT 
FRIENDLY FOR THE KIDS.  

304
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,724
WINSTON WAS CUTTING 
LUMBER FOR US.
 

305
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,559
AND I WAS ACTUALLY, UH -- 

306
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,594
OH, THERE'S WALTER PUTTING UP 
THE SIGN FOR THE KIDDIE AREA.
 

307
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:58,264
AND HE HAD ONE OF THOSE NAIL 
GUNS, AND BOY, THEY'RE 
QUITE A UNIT, EH? 

308
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,965
I WAS CAULKING, AS I SAY, 
BETWEEN THE SCREENS
 

309
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,834
TO KEEP THE BUGS IN AND --  

310
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,069
DALTON HAD THE STAPLE 
GUN KINDA JAMMED
 

311
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,272
AND -- OH! OH! 

312
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,674
WELL, THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH, DALTON. 

313
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:12,444
WELL, IT'S AN EYE FOR AN EYE 
AND SOME CAULKING FOR 
A STAPLE. 

314
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,713
OH, RIGHT INTO 
WINSTON'S COFFEE,
 

315
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,183
BUT LUCKILY HE DIDN'T 
SEE IT UNTIL HE HAD A SENSE
 
SOMETHING WASN'T QUITE RIGHT.

316
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,853
THEN THINGS STARTED 
TO GO BAD AFTER THAT.
 

317
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,023
THEN THE NAIL GOES RIGHT 
INTO THE POOL AND THE 
WATER COMES OUT, 

318
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,692
HITS THE PLUG, 
AND THEN -- OH! OH!
 

319
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,527
AND THE SAW KEEPS RUNNING. 

320
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,429
THE BLADE'S DIGGING IN, 
AND AWAY SHE GOES.
 

321
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,631
THE SAW'S HEADING 
OVER TOWARD WALTER.
 

322
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,266
SO DALTON SAYS, 
YOU GOTTA GIVE IT --  

323
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,001
THAT'S STUPID. 
YOU FIRED THAT,
 
YOU HIT THE POOL.

324
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,469
JUST GIVE ME THAT THING. 

325
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,571
NOW SHE GOES 
INTO AUTOMATIC.
 

326
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,573
NOW WE GOT A REAL PROBLEM. 

327
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,543
AND THOSE ARE 
GOOD SIZED NAILS TOO.

328
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,278
DON'T FORGET ABOUT WINSTON. 

329
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,847
HE'S LYING RIGHT IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE BATTLEFIELD. 

330
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,984
WALTER GOES IN THERE, 
AND THIS IS THE KIND OF THING
 

331
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,652
YOU HAVE TO 
DO AT THE LODGE. 

332
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,754
JUST IGNORE THE FIRE AND -- 

333
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,457
I'VE SEEN THIS IN A MOVIE 
OR SOMETHING, HAVEN'T I?
 
 

334
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,126
WELL, ANYWAY, EVERYTHING 
FINALLY SETTLED DOWN. 

335
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,429
THE NAIL GUN STOPPED. 

336
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,732
AND THE AREA WAS RUINED, 
BUT WE SURVIVED. 

337
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:09,268
WHAT ABOUT THE SAW? 
I'M THINKING THE CIRCULAR SAW
 

338
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:12,171
IS STILL ON THE 
LOOSE SOMEWHERE.
 

339
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,806
YOU KNOW WHAT, 
HERE IT COMES!
 

340
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:15,441
HERE IT COMES! 
LOOK OUT! 

341
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,343
AND SHE GOES 
RIGHT UP THE SIGN AND -- 

342
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,311
OKAY, NOW WE HAVE 
A NEW NAME.
 

343
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:20,913
THERE'S TWO WAYS 
TO PRONOUNCE THAT. 

344
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,648
I DON'T LIKE 
EITHER ONE OF THEM.
 

345
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:25,417
[applause]

346
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,593
IT'S TIME FOR THE EXPERTS'
PORTION OF THE SHOW,

347
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:37,863
WHERE WE ADDRESS THOSE
THREE LITTLE WORDS MEN
FIND SO HARD TO SAY...
 

348
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,166
THOSE ARE THE WORDS.
audience: I DON'T KNOW!

349
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,268
AND JOINING US TODAY,
MARINA OWNER

350
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,805
AND IDLE CURIOSITY,
DWIGHT CARTER.

351
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,141
ALL RIGHT, FELLAS,
HERE'S THE LETTER...

352
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:53,012
"DEAR EXPERTS, I HAVE RECENTLY
THOUGHT ABOUT TAKING UP
SKY-DIVING

353
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,114
"AND WANTED TO KNOW
IF YOU HAVE ANY TIPS."

354
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,216
OKAY, YEAH, SURE.

355
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,618
NOW, EVERY GUY HAS
A VOICE IN HIS HEAD

356
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,187
THAT STOPS HIM
FROM DOING DUMB THINGS.

357
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,790
ACTUALLY, IF YOU'RE MARRIED,
YOU HAVE TWO OF 'EM.

358
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,996
AND THE LOUD ONE
ISN'T EVEN YOURS.

359
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:14,233
BUT THIS VOICE STOPS YOU
FROM DOING IDIOTIC STUFF

360
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,802
LIKE JUMPING OUT OF AIRPLANES,

361
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,905
OR QUITTING YOUR JOB
TO BECOME A MIME,

362
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:23,175
OR SHARING YOUR THOUGHTS.

363
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,144
YEAH, I AGREE
WITH YOU.

364
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,112
I THINK
SKY-DIVING'S NUTS.

365
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,914
I MEAN, I HAVE
MY OWN BUSINESS,

366
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:31,550
SO IF I JUMP OUT OF A
PLANE AND DO A FACE PLANT

367
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,952
INTO THE GROUND
AT 120 MILES AN HOUR,

368
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,822
I'M OFF WORK
WITHOUT PAY.

369
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:40,059
YOU'RE OFF EVERYTHING
WITHOUT ANYTHING.

370
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,061
WELL, I LIKE
SKY-DIVING.

371
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:43,996
I THINK IT'S
A GREAT SPORT.

372
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,131
YOU GET SOME GUY
TO SUIT YOU UP,

373
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:47,766
STRAP ON YOUR CHUTE,

374
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,436
AND ALL YOU HAVE
TO DO IS FALL.

375
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:53,605
GRAVITY DOES ALL THE WORK.

376
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,542
AND OF COURSE
YOU HAVE TO STAY LOOSE.

377
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,611
AND I'M REAL GOOD
AT STAYING LOOSE.

378
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,914
BOY, I TELL YOU WHAT,
IF I FELL OFF AN AIRPLANE,

379
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:04,783
I'D BE SO LOOSE
I'D COME UNDONE.

380
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,985
AH, YOU'D BE SURPRISED.

381
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,121
FALLING THOUSANDS OF
FEET IN A FEW SECONDS

382
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:11,223
CAN BE VERY RELAXING.

383
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,593
SOMETIMES I FALL ASLEEP
ON THE WAY DOWN.

384
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:19,865
YEAH, BUT, DWIGHT,
YOU HAVE A VERY LOW
DROWSE THRESHOLD.

385
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:23,302
I'VE SEEN YOU FALL
ASLEEP WATER-SKIING.

386
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:26,438
WELL, IT'S A LOT OF FUN.
WE HAVE A GREAT TIME.

387
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,708
WE? YOU MEAN YOU'RE
NOT THE ONLY WHACKO THAT
JUMPS OUT OF THAT PLANE?

388
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,711
OH, NO, JUNIOR, BUSTER,
STINKY AND I GO

389
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:34,680
EVERY OTHER SATURDAY.

390
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,081
OKAY, WELL,
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

391
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,516
THAT'S A LITTLE
BIT DIFFERENT.

392
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,951
YEAH, THAT'S NOT SO CRAZY

393
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,752
BECAUSE IF YOU GET A BUNCH
OF GUYS TO GO WITH YOU,

394
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,088
IT'S MORE LIKE BONDING.

395
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,923
OKAY, WELL -- OKAY, WELL,
THERE'S OUR ANSWER.

396
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,326
OKAY, THIS VIEWER, IT'S GREAT
FOR YOU TO GO SKY-DIVING,

397
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:49,995
AS LONG AS YOU GET A BUNCH
OF GUYS TO GO WITH YOU.

398
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:51,396
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A GOOD IDEA.

399
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,165
YEAH, BUT YOU GOTTA GET
EVERYBODY TO CHECK WITH
THEIR WIVES FIRST

400
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,667
AND MAKE SURE
THAT IT'S OKAY.

401
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:59,471
IF THE WIVES SAY NO,
THE GUYS DON'T GO, RIGHT?

402
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:00,906
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

403
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,909
AND IF THE WIVES SAY YES,
I'D SAY ALL YOUR MARRIAGES
ARE IN TROUBLE.

404
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,424
OKAY, UH, LOOKS LIKE THIS IS
GONNA BE THE LAST YEAR

405
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,493
FOR THE CHAIN SAW RACES.

406
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:26,098
YOU KNOW, ORDINARILY WE
RUN JUST TWO AT A TIME,
LIKE IN HEATS.

407
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,966
BUT WE THOUGHT IT
WOULD BE A LOT SAFER

408
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,401
IF WE GOT IT OVER QUICKER,

409
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:32,104
SO WE JUST LET ALL THE
CHAIN SAWS GO AT ONCE.

410
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,740
AND, UH, WE WERE HALF RIGHT.
IT WAS QUICKER.

411
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,809
UNCLE RED!

412
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,112
[laughter]

413
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:41,914
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO TELL
THE PARENTS WHEN THEY ASK

414
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,950
WHY WERE THEIR CHILDREN BEING
CHASED BY CHAIN SAWS?

415
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,554
JUST TELL 'EM IT WAS PART
OF THE CAMP EXPERIENCE.

416
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:51,790
IT TAUGHT THEM ROCK CLIMBING
AND TREE SHINNYING.

417
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:54,626
OH! OH! OH!
UNCLE RED!

418
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,195
LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF HIS HEAD.

419
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:59,831
HE'S A GIFTED PERSON;
THESE ARE GIFTED CHILDREN.

420
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,167
WELL, THEN THEY SHOULD
BE SMART ENOUGH TO GET
OUT OF THE WAY.

421
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,637
[applause]
YOU KNOW --

422
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,272
HAROLD, LOOK, OKAY,
THE CHAIN SAW RACE,

423
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,875
IT WAS A DUMB THING, BUT WE'RE
NEVER GONNA DO IT AGAIN.

424
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,477
BUT YOU GOTTA ADMIT
IT WAS KINDA FUN, EH?

425
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,479
ISN'T THAT PART OF THE WHOLE
CAMP FEELING, HUH?

426
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,515
NO, NO, IT'S NOT.
TELL HIM, THORNTON.

427
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,117
THERE WE GO!
MR. GREEN.
THAT WAS SO COOL,

428
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:22,788
[possum squealing]

429
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:24,389
MEETING TIME, HAROLD
AWAY YOU GO.

430
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:25,924
WOW! CAN I COME?

431
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,693
NO, NO,
NOW, THORNTON --

432
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,296
THORNTON, THERE ARE NO
INTELLIGENT PEOPLE
DOWN THERE.

433
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,967
IT'S BEST THAT I GO DOWN AND
YOU GO TO TO CHESS CLUB, OKAY?

434
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,269
GO TO CHESS CLUB.

435
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:40,606
audience: A-A-AH.

436
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,109
HEY, THORNTON,
THORNTON.

437
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,712
SO IF MY WIFE
IS WATCHING,

438
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,480
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT
HOME AFTER THE MEETING.

439
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,449
AND YOU WERE DEAD RIGHT
ABOUT THE CHAIN SAW RACES.

440
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,084
WE'RE NEVER
DOING THAT AGAIN.

441
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,219
WE'RE GOING WITH
BELT SANDERS NEXT YEAR.

442
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,588
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,

443
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,190
ON BEHALF OF
MYSELF AND THORNTON

444
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,058
AND WHOLE GANG UP
HERE AT POSSUM LODGE,

445
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,526
KEEP YOUR STICK
ON THE ICE.

446
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,195
WHAT HE SAID.

447
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,497
[applause]

448
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,307
SIT DOWN.
COME TO ORDER.

449
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,908
HEY, GUYS, SIT DOWN.

450
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,310
SIT DOWN.

451
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,580
ALL RISE!

452
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:26,785
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI. 

453
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,854
Red: SIT DOWN.

454
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,323
BOW YOUR HEADS
FOR THE MEN'S PRAYER.
