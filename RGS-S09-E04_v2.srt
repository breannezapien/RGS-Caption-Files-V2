MISSING THE FRONT WHEELS;

192

GOT A CHUNK OF
AN EXTENSION LADDER;

193
00:08:22,934 --> 00:08:25,437
AND A KID'S BIKE.

194
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:27,072
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO
MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF THIS.

195
00:08:59,404 --> 00:09:01,006
IF AT FIRST YOU
DON'T SUCCEED,

196
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:03,408
USE MORE DUCT TAPE.

AND HEADERS ON THERE.

201

BUT A LAWN MOWER ENGINE
DOES ONE THING

JUST AS GOOD
AS ANY V-8,

DE-INSTALL THE MUFFLER.

I'M NOT SURE
WHAT IT IS,

210

BUT IF IT GOES THROUGH THAT

WENT THROUGH JUNIOR,

WE'LL BE LOOKING
AT A LAND SPEED RECORD.

212

A CHAIR WITH NO LEGS
MAKES A PERFECT SEAT,

213
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:46,918

MAKES A PERFECT STEERING WHEEL.
