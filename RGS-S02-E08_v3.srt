1
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:25,191
But.

2
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:44,043
And now it's time for a show that answers the
philosophical question if a tree falls in the

3
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:47,447
forest and lands on a guy's head and you
know, a bunch of bees come out of the

4
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:50,016
branches and right into his pants, as does
make a sound?

5
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,484
Well, the answer is yes.

6
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:52,585
Believe me, I know.

7
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:55,655
And anyway, here's a man who has a bunch of
sounds of his own.

8
00:00:55,955 --> 00:01:00,126
The star of the Red Green show a man I like
to call uncle even when he doesn't have me in

9
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,995
the headlock. Here he is, Mr.

10
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:03,530
Red Green.

11
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:10,803
Thank you, and welcome to Possum Lodge, I'm
Bret Green, head of head of this possum

12
00:01:10,803 --> 00:01:15,041
lodge, which is Chapter 11, and you've
already met my nephew, Harold, who's been

13
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,443
second on the head by his share of trees
falling in the forest.

14
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,346
Harold is actually the producer and director
of the show.

15
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:21,347
Whatever that means,

16
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:24,450
It happens to mean that when I push these
buttons, this happens

17
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,857
Anyway. Lots of stuff going on up the lodge
this week.

18
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:33,860
We're getting a brand new four man raft, so
we're probably going to be a lot of arguing

19
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,029
about which four guys are going to get to
win that first.

20
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:39,432
And besides, the other thing was going on
was, you know, the bunch of us like just kind

21
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,667
of work on our own cars.

22
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:43,970
So we thought we'd build one of them
mechanics, bits like they have at the gas

23
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,104
station. So we thought we just wouldn't dig
it.

24
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:48,975
And we all got a bunch of shovels and picks
and hockey sticks and they went out there.

25
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,243
And actually the way it worked was a moose.

26
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:53,579
Thompson and Helmet Winter Garden were the
only ones that were digging the trench, and

27
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,549
the rest of us just kind of stood there
leaning on our tools, so it looked like a

28
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:57,884
real professional government job.

29
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:02,221
They got her. They got her dug pretty fast
because the ground was real soft.

30
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:04,490
Although hacking through the waterline took
some time.

31
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:08,461
They got her all done there and it was long
enough that we could get six cars on that.

32
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,996
We just would straddle the ditch right up
there.

33
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,364
Just one two three. Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang,
Bang.

34
00:02:11,497 --> 00:02:14,634
And then we all crawled under our own
vehicles and and started working on them.

35
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:18,471
Unfortunately, like I said, the ground was a
little soft and one side started to cave in

36
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:22,408
and all the cars started rolling over and
they all ended up right up.

37
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:26,446
Yeah, yeah. What happened to the guys working
under the cars?

38
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,551
Well, the herd went so slowly we see that the
guy could actually open the driver's door and

39
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:34,420
climb up over the seat and go right out the
passenger door.

40
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:38,124
So we ended up with six cars lying there
upside down.

41
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,159
Why you don't see that every day?

42
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:43,329
No, no, not. Not since Moose got fired from
that job.

43
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,197
Valet parking.

44
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:49,168
This is cool. It's like that town in Texas,
where they got those six Cadillacs buried in

45
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,070
the ground and only their tail stick out.

46
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:53,139
It's really avant garde and trade cool.

47
00:02:53,372 --> 00:02:54,874
Oh yeah. And it's a major tourist
attraction.

48
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,779
I guess they must have done their their
mechanics pit in the same kind of sandy soil

49
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,347
that we got. Yeah, I guess so.

50
00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:03,549
Well, let's get the show rolling, Harold.

51
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,217
Hopefully not into the ground.

52
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:07,453
All righty, then.

53
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:13,626
Oh, is that right here?

54
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:18,497
Yeah. How about inside a large tire

55
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:20,633
Sitting on the couch they're doing?

56
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:29,175
That's a raft.

57
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,979
That's your idea of a four man red.

58
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:37,516
Yeah. Murray's own brand, that's not a raft.

59
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,752
That's a piece of homemade crap.

60
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,621
That's a kindergarten science project.

61
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,024
Duct tape is a nice touch.

62
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,225
Well, you enjoy it.

63
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,494
Let's go, Dwayne Murray.

64
00:03:48,527 --> 00:03:51,230
Hold it, Dwayne. I'm not paying for this.

65
00:03:51,697 --> 00:03:56,635
Well, you already have remember, I want a
refund with interest.

66
00:03:56,635 --> 00:03:58,738
Oh, that's good. Douglas, I like that.

67
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,873
But we have a policy about returning items.

68
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:02,341
Oh, what's that?

69
00:04:02,374 --> 00:04:06,545
We don't. This is not a raft.

70
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,647
A raft has a bow and the stern.

71
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:11,484
Well, this one has lots of side.

72
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:15,054
Can you call this a four man raft?

73
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:17,456
Oh, maybe it's out of a four by four.

74
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:20,159
How do you put them on a run?

75
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,995
Well, it hangs in the middle there.

76
00:04:24,363 --> 00:04:28,267
I'm real impressed. Marie Chromatograph takes
lots of guts.

77
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:36,609
Marie, if you value your reproductive
abilities, you won't get this out of here.

78
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:39,879
And very quickly, give me back my money.

79
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:41,380
Your money, huh?

80
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,582
It's the largest money, Douglas.

81
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:45,784
Let's go, Dwayne. Ok, Murray, hold it,
Murray.

82
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:47,987
Get it, Douglas. Let's go, Duane.

83
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,689
Ok, hold it. Ignore him.

84
00:04:50,756 --> 00:04:51,757
Blake Murray.

85
00:04:51,790 --> 00:05:00,833
No. Why move Freddie to look at lovely to
hold?

86
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:04,370
But if you break it, consider it sold.

87
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:05,971
That's our creed, you know?

88
00:05:16,715 --> 00:05:21,787
You can learn a lot at parties, as we did
last night.

89
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:28,694
We learned that fat people aren't always
jolly and you should never dare someone to

90
00:05:28,694 --> 00:05:30,162
throw bullets in the fire.

91
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:40,339
We learned that alcohol and power tools
don't mix, and we learned that the fire

92
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:45,444
department doesn't always arrive soon enough
to make any tangible difference.

93
00:05:56,855 --> 00:06:01,894
This week on Handymen Corner, we're going to
show you some things you can do with all of

94
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:06,298
those oil drums that you have lying around
your house like everybody does.

95
00:06:06,498 --> 00:06:10,636
We're not too bad here up the lodge because
we can use them for flotation, for the dock

96
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:14,640
or maybe make a couple of ashtrays out of
them, you know, but maybe something you want

97
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,876
to be more stylish because you're actually
concerned with what other people think.

98
00:06:18,777 --> 00:06:20,279
So I suggest you do something like this.

99
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:26,151
You take a cold chisel and persuader of some
kind and you just drive a hole and then the

100
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:35,827
little drum. What you have, there is just an
ideal piggy bank for the youngsters.

101
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:43,902
That's enough. Know what you can do there
too is just, well, the hunk of chain on here

102
00:06:43,902 --> 00:06:47,639
and just hanging over the hotel, his neck
and he can go out in Halloween, collect for

103
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,711
UNICEF. And once he gets filled up course,
you drop her on her side and you can use it

104
00:06:52,711 --> 00:06:57,316
to roll on. Or you can just knock the lid
off the thing and there's your college

105
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:58,383
education paid for.

106
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:03,188
If that's the way you carry it, spend your
money and that one thing I can do is I'll be

107
00:07:03,188 --> 00:07:06,291
getting old chisel or a screwdriver and pry
the lid off.

108
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,126
Or you could you could use whatever you got
in your pockets.

109
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:15,834
You know your your car keys or bottle opener
or business card, and it just comes off as

110
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:25,644
easy as pie to. Ok,

111
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:30,549
once you've done that, you can use the lid
as a serving tray and you can cover it all

112
00:07:30,549 --> 00:07:36,922
with crackers and then you fill your oil
drum with Pat, or if you're on a budget, just

113
00:07:37,022 --> 00:07:38,523
use peanut butter with anchovies in it.

114
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,226
Just take a cracker

115
00:07:42,027 --> 00:07:43,662
Scoop into the Oh boy,

116
00:07:43,762 --> 00:07:45,130
So that looks great, doesn't it?

117
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:51,169
Ok, maybe we should rinse the oil out of
there first.

118
00:07:52,637 --> 00:07:55,207
You're having a party in, you got three
thousand guests are so coming.

119
00:07:55,574 --> 00:07:58,844
I'm telling you an oil drum for the party is
going to just serve everybody.

120
00:07:58,844 --> 00:08:02,314
You're going to run out of crackers way
before you run out of paté.

121
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:05,851
And the beauty of it is with this system
that when the party is over, just pop the lid

122
00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:09,354
back on there and run a bead of silicone
caulking around the outside.

123
00:08:09,354 --> 00:08:11,189
And that'll keep indefinitely without
refrigeration.

124
00:08:12,691 --> 00:08:15,160
We've had this particular party since, uh.

125
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:19,598
I was in the forties, I think. And if you're
dealing with a cutting torch, you know, you

126
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:21,299
can really go to town on these units.

127
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:23,969
You know, you cut up the oil drums into all
kinds of different things.

128
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:29,341
Love seat or patio furniture or some kind of
a decorative awning.

129
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:34,112
There's all kinds of things. Another idea is
a bird feeding station, you know, one of

130
00:08:34,112 --> 00:08:37,415
these. You're talking about a 50 gallon bird
feeding station.

131
00:08:37,949 --> 00:08:39,351
You only have to fill that sucker once a
year.

132
00:08:44,189 --> 00:08:50,061
Ok, so you got yourself a dandy bird feeder
and you know, this is a joke.

133
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:52,530
You can fill that thing up with oat bran.

134
00:08:53,431 --> 00:08:56,267
The birds will eat that and they'll wish
they'd gone south, but you're going to have

135
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:57,302
the best lawn on the street.

136
00:08:58,236 --> 00:08:59,471
And here's something else you can do an oil
drum.

137
00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:04,142
You can build yourself a doorbell that you
can hear from any room in the house.

138
00:09:04,676 --> 00:09:08,313
What you do is you just get a pretty heavy
little persuader such as this and you hang it

139
00:09:08,313 --> 00:09:13,251
from one ear rafters or the doorknob, your
bedroom or whatever, and you have that

140
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:16,855
hanging down and you line it up with an oil
drum and then you put the hammer over the

141
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:20,759
door. And then when anyone arrives the
swings in, then you can really hear.

142
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:23,695
I'll show you how it works. This is going to
be the sound you're going to hear when your

143
00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:33,605
guests arrive. Ok, I got to

144
00:09:33,605 --> 00:09:40,145
watch for the type of not use on that, OK,
for the next thing, now you're going to need

145
00:09:40,145 --> 00:09:44,582
a picnic table. Now you can buy a picnic
table or you can build your own or if you

146
00:09:44,582 --> 00:09:47,519
have a decent chain cutter, you can get one
free from a conservation area.

147
00:09:48,486 --> 00:09:51,756
And I don't think they're going to need is a
couple of these steel rods.

148
00:09:52,757 --> 00:09:56,394
These are what they call reinforcing rods
they use for the construction crews.

149
00:09:56,394 --> 00:10:00,131
But you know you can horse them right out of
the concrete if you get there before it sets.

150
00:10:00,965 --> 00:10:02,367
That's how I learned all my Italian swear
words.

151
00:10:03,668 --> 00:10:06,838
And the next thing you're going to need is
what we call a whole saw.

152
00:10:06,938 --> 00:10:11,976
And they use that you're going to punch some
holes in each end of the oil drums and also

153
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:21,719
into the picnic table. I'd like to

154
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:24,055
have is an industrial strength T wagon.

155
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,825
You're right, Harold. You know, it does look
like Fred Flintstone Scar.

156
00:10:28,993 --> 00:10:38,736
Anyway, we put our patch up here and now
we're all set to go serve our

157
00:10:38,736 --> 00:10:43,308
guests. So remember, until next time the
women don't find you handsome, they should at

158
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:48,846
least find your handy yabba dabba doo.

159
00:11:03,561 --> 00:11:08,099
Well, I guess you hear that you can leave it
there.

160
00:11:08,566 --> 00:11:09,967
You know, if they're doing get away.

161
00:11:18,543 --> 00:11:21,212
This spring, I pluck the petals from a
flower.

162
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:24,082
She loves me, she loves me, not she loves
me.

163
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:26,884
He loves me, not. I pluck another flower.

164
00:11:27,218 --> 00:11:28,486
He loves me. She loves me.

165
00:11:28,486 --> 00:11:30,254
Not. I pluck another flower.

166
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:34,892
She loves me. Not another flower and another
until there is one flower left.

167
00:11:35,193 --> 00:11:36,627
She loves me. She loves me.

168
00:11:36,627 --> 00:11:37,995
Not she loves me.

169
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:39,964
Oh, good. She loves me.

170
00:11:40,832 --> 00:11:42,400
The gardener, on the other hand, hates my
guts.

171
00:11:49,106 --> 00:11:53,377
Well, the situation with the large number of
cars is still up in the air, or, I should

172
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:54,745
say, down in the ground.

173
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:58,216
And then the four man raft has caused some
unpleasant feelings too.

174
00:11:58,216 --> 00:12:00,184
Actually, I should say there are some
unpleasant smell.

175
00:12:00,184 --> 00:12:05,189
I mean, that rubbery odor for it's like it's
like old gym socks, you know, anytime we get

176
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:08,159
that smell as Thanksgiving, when Eddie makes
one of his pumpkin pies,

177
00:12:09,026 --> 00:12:10,361
You know, it's it's been going.

178
00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:13,731
For about 20 minutes now, I think scaring
me.

179
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:17,134
Why hasn't Douglas just, you know, write it
off, what's 60 bucks

180
00:12:17,468 --> 00:12:19,070
On my van with 60 bucks, Harold?

181
00:12:19,203 --> 00:12:21,272
Yeah, you were able to write off that loss.

182
00:12:21,906 --> 00:12:23,107
Why can't Douglass do the same?

183
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:26,711
Well, Harold, you know, it's tough for a man
to admit that he's made a mistake.

184
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:29,780
You know, the whole point of being a man is
just a it's just a tough these things

185
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,584
through. See them through, you know, I mean,
take a stand show some leadership and others

186
00:12:33,584 --> 00:12:37,188
will follow. Well, that way you have six
cars upside down instead of just one.

187
00:12:38,022 --> 00:12:42,126
Basically, yes, but but that way you end up
looking equally stupid with everybody else,

188
00:12:42,126 --> 00:12:43,527
you see. And that's OK.

189
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:47,365
It's it's a male pride thing, you know,
something that you'll understand when you're

190
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:49,000
older and male.

191
00:12:50,034 --> 00:12:51,268
Oh, yeah.

192
00:13:00,177 --> 00:13:01,679
This is not a boat ride.

193
00:13:03,014 --> 00:13:04,482
I've worked with Marina all my life.

194
00:13:04,515 --> 00:13:09,186
I've seen skiffs catches everything, you
know, kayaks.

195
00:13:09,954 --> 00:13:11,055
This is not a boat,

196
00:13:12,056 --> 00:13:13,758
So it doesn't have a lot of trade in value
then.

197
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:18,796
Well, if you brought me something in, there
was more boat like red, you know, like an old

198
00:13:18,796 --> 00:13:20,965
apple crate or an old bathtub or something.

199
00:13:22,266 --> 00:13:23,400
No, I'm glad you like that.

200
00:13:23,934 --> 00:13:26,570
Well, I'll give you a buck for it.

201
00:13:28,372 --> 00:13:29,573
I just made twelve hundred

202
00:13:30,074 --> 00:13:31,175
Twelve hundred one dollars.

203
00:13:31,609 --> 00:13:36,247
Oh yeah. I can't see this particular item
being worth twelve hundred bucks anywhere,

204
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:40,017
right? Unless there's a thousand dollar bill
in that tackle box or something?

205
00:13:43,087 --> 00:13:46,524
No. It boggles my mind when I look at the
size of this tire.

206
00:13:47,091 --> 00:13:51,862
So imagine the RV that this would fit this
time here, and it has to be a hundred feet

207
00:13:51,862 --> 00:13:53,731
long and 30 feet wide.

208
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:57,535
Yeah. Well, Douglas was one.

209
00:13:57,635 --> 00:14:00,137
Maybe you could just kind of trade us even
for a wooden pump.

210
00:14:00,337 --> 00:14:07,344
Oh yeah, right? You know, I don't be that
big, but you could have a spiral staircase in

211
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:07,511
there.

212
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,448
Yeah. Well, I got to tell you, I got some bad

213
00:14:11,448 --> 00:14:16,553
News, man. I mean, it was just so high off
the ground that you could have a basement,

214
00:14:16,887 --> 00:14:19,723
you know, an actual basement.

215
00:14:20,858 --> 00:14:22,626
Well, thanks for your time glam.

216
00:14:22,626 --> 00:14:23,761
I got I got to get back to work.

217
00:14:23,961 --> 00:14:24,361
All right, right?

218
00:14:27,398 --> 00:14:29,099
I imagine trying to back up on our view that
big.

219
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:34,305
I mean, imagine trying to back up something
a hundred feet long into a parking spot at

220
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:37,508
the mall. I mean, even those big, huge side
mirrors.

221
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:39,043
You know what?

222
00:14:39,643 --> 00:14:42,946
What am I thinking? Something that big would
have to come with that standard on it.

223
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:46,383
It would have everything standard equipment
on that thing.

224
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:47,918
There'd be no options.

225
00:14:48,952 --> 00:14:50,320
That would be a dream boat.

226
00:14:52,823 --> 00:14:56,860
Sorry. That's just that pie in the sky
stuff, honey.

227
00:14:58,862 --> 00:15:00,330
Well, call nine one one.

228
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:04,334
It's a time for adventures of Bill, Vail
said.

229
00:15:04,501 --> 00:15:08,272
We can do some archery. So I brought a bowl
on a couple of arrows, but it's not the way

230
00:15:08,272 --> 00:15:10,240
he had in mind. Even just check those out of
there.

231
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:13,077
This, I thought, was a little presumptuous.

232
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,114
Hey. That was a fitting response, I felt.

233
00:15:18,248 --> 00:15:23,253
What do you want to do was he wanted to go
into the woods and make our own bows and

234
00:15:23,253 --> 00:15:25,689
arrows just from whatever we could find in
the woods.

235
00:15:26,223 --> 00:15:29,326
So it's amazing how fast you can find stuff
when you're filming.

236
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:35,933
And I came out with what I thought was a
good stick, and bill was going to make that

237
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:37,935
into some type of a bowl.

238
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:41,004
I mean, I don't ask because Bill's.

239
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:43,807
He knows what he's doing. I'm just kind of,
you know, poking my way along.

240
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:45,742
I'm using logic and common sense.

241
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:51,248
He's using a lot of book reading and in his
stuff, anyway, I got my vote done and he got

242
00:15:51,248 --> 00:15:54,885
his done a little different, I guess is more
of a repeater.

243
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:56,486
I guess that's out there.

244
00:15:57,554 --> 00:16:01,325
I did question it, though. Now we want to go
find some little sticks to use for the shafts

245
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:04,094
and arrows. So I saw something lying there I
thought would be adequate.

246
00:16:04,094 --> 00:16:06,363
But Bill, you know, he's a bit of a
perfectionist.

247
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,532
He wants just that.

248
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:12,703
To me, that tree seemed it seemed dead, but
I guess he just wanted it out of it.

249
00:16:13,136 --> 00:16:15,105
I think you want just to get that out of the
way, Martin.

250
00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:19,042
Well, but then bills the bills, really?

251
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:21,545
The Woodsman. But he did find something
there.

252
00:16:23,413 --> 00:16:24,881
Yeah, it could have just got that.

253
00:16:24,881 --> 00:16:27,884
And then. Oh, I see a little plowing.

254
00:16:28,352 --> 00:16:29,519
And now he's back in.

255
00:16:30,787 --> 00:16:35,058
Thank you, Bill. Now we're going to carve
out the shaft shafts again here with the

256
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:40,530
arrow shaft, you picked one that I thought
was a little, well, I lost my temper anyway.

257
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:44,968
We tied stones onto the shafts of the
arrows, so that would be the one.

258
00:16:44,968 --> 00:16:47,637
I'd be the arrowhead. And Bill's was pretty
generous.

259
00:16:49,005 --> 00:16:54,644
And then we snip off the string I got that's
a little leaves we use for the feathers and.

260
00:16:55,345 --> 00:16:58,281
It was kind of fun, you know, it was getting
a bit interesting, Bill put a target up on

261
00:16:58,281 --> 00:17:04,354
the tree and start to feel like day camp,
you know, and there's mine and and there's

262
00:17:04,354 --> 00:17:05,489
been there's bills.

263
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:09,126
So I loaded mine up and I gave her a try.

264
00:17:11,528 --> 00:17:12,562
How's that, Robin Hood?

265
00:17:13,463 --> 00:17:18,768
And now Bill's going to probably split that
arrow with his could happen, I guess.

266
00:17:21,671 --> 00:17:22,772
Not too likely.

267
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:24,641
So you look at this.

268
00:17:24,674 --> 00:17:32,716
Now you see Bill is a be prepared kind of
thing whips that out and to find out how we

269
00:17:32,716 --> 00:17:35,385
got enough to make bows and arrows for the
whole watch.

270
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:50,567
Well, that four man raft has really come in
handy for getting the cars out of the ditch.

271
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:54,771
What we do is we we slide the deflated tube
in underneath the cars and then we start

272
00:17:54,771 --> 00:17:57,173
pumping it up and it presses up against the
roof of the car.

273
00:17:57,173 --> 00:18:01,077
And when she gets up to 60 70 pounds, the
carts pop straight out of the inland lands

274
00:18:01,077 --> 00:18:04,948
right on its wheels. But of course, Murray
and Douglas are still at each other's

275
00:18:04,948 --> 00:18:10,854
throats. Douglas hired a skywriter to fly
over the store and say, Do not shop at.

276
00:18:10,854 --> 00:18:16,192
Murray's will not ever need exposing a guy
with letters five hundred feet high.

277
00:18:16,826 --> 00:18:21,398
Yeah, but unfortunately, the pilot bought the
smoke canister at Murray's store, so you know

278
00:18:21,398 --> 00:18:26,603
it misfired. And what he ended up writing
was doughnut shop at Murray's Murray and

279
00:18:26,603 --> 00:18:28,505
Wainer, making a fortune selling doughnuts.

280
00:18:29,172 --> 00:18:30,507
And of course, Douglas won't admit he made a
mistake.

281
00:18:31,174 --> 00:18:34,144
Oh yeah, well, that male pride thing, right?

282
00:18:34,144 --> 00:18:38,114
Yeah. See, you're lucky you don't suffer
from that like male ego thing.

283
00:18:38,515 --> 00:18:39,582
No, no, not really.

284
00:18:39,582 --> 00:18:42,052
No. James, it's too bad more men can't be
like you.

285
00:18:42,052 --> 00:18:44,087
You know having nothing to be proud of.

286
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:47,924
Get that inner tube thing going again.

287
00:18:48,758 --> 00:18:50,593
No, that's the choir of the wild foursome.

288
00:18:50,794 --> 00:18:52,195
The meeting is about to come to order.

289
00:18:52,228 --> 00:18:54,364
Come on, let's get down there and find out
what's going on.

290
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:55,498
Yeah, OK, Harold.

291
00:18:55,865 --> 00:19:00,470
Well, so far today we've had a cartoon up
turn into an auto graveyard and we've had a

292
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,172
four man rafting into a whoopee cushion.

293
00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:04,407
Let's see what the lodge meeting turns into,
right?

294
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:18,688
I think we to start right away.

295
00:19:19,022 --> 00:19:20,924
I would sit down first before he gets here
high.

296
00:19:22,091 --> 00:19:23,393
Here we go. All right.

297
00:19:28,331 --> 00:19:31,467
I'm no longer in quarantine to know

298
00:19:34,737 --> 00:19:36,506
The floor, recognizes Douglas Hendricks.

299
00:19:39,242 --> 00:19:43,713
That man has no scruples.

300
00:19:44,681 --> 00:19:45,782
Well, that's probably from that hunting
accident.

301
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,686
I mean, he has no ethics read.

302
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,490
He sold us a four man raft that turned out
to be a donut with gas.

303
00:19:54,757 --> 00:19:56,225
Are you going to come down and look at it
first?

304
00:19:56,626 --> 00:19:58,595
But all you cared about was the price.

305
00:19:58,628 --> 00:19:59,295
See that.

306
00:19:59,295 --> 00:20:01,831
See that that's the last thing you worry
about when you buy something.

307
00:20:01,831 --> 00:20:02,699
For me, the price

308
00:20:03,499 --> 00:20:09,405
I am for all the Possum Lodge members to
boycott Murray's store until I get a full

309
00:20:09,405 --> 00:20:14,110
refund for the raft and the skywriter, he
can afford it out of doughnuts.

310
00:20:14,844 --> 00:20:17,146
Well, that is just fine.

311
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,350
All I ever get from you is why is that so
expensive?

312
00:20:21,284 --> 00:20:22,585
Or We can't afford that?

313
00:20:22,618 --> 00:20:25,521
Or why does all your stock have all these
burn marks on them?

314
00:20:25,555 --> 00:20:29,726
Well, you are not getting a refund, and I do
not care if you ever walk into my store

315
00:20:29,726 --> 00:20:35,932
again. Your business isn't worth keeping you
a when I'd rather be a crook than a

316
00:20:35,932 --> 00:20:40,103
skinflint. I admire people who make definite
career choices.

317
00:20:42,105 --> 00:20:43,206
I put this to a vote.

318
00:20:43,673 --> 00:20:46,843
But this is a special problem, and it
requires a special solution.

319
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:55,451
A dual. It'll get the fire extinguisher.

320
00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:04,093
You two guys are going to need seconds,
right, you're like seconds, you'll be very

321
00:21:04,093 --> 00:21:05,294
second man.

322
00:21:05,361 --> 00:21:06,529
Gabby Douglas a second.

323
00:21:07,864 --> 00:21:08,798
Oh man.

324
00:21:09,532 --> 00:21:12,268
Douglas. Be brave.

325
00:21:12,668 --> 00:21:13,236
Be brave.

326
00:21:14,403 --> 00:21:15,771
All right, guys. Superposition.

327
00:21:15,805 --> 00:21:19,675
Come on. Come on. Go back to Mike Elliott
about it.

328
00:21:19,876 --> 00:21:20,142
The fire

329
00:21:20,142 --> 00:21:22,445
Extinguishers. Now here's how it works.

330
00:21:22,912 --> 00:21:24,113
You take three paces.

331
00:21:24,146 --> 00:21:25,014
You turn your fire.

332
00:21:25,047 --> 00:21:27,550
You got it. Really?

333
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,252
Go, Hey, what?

334
00:21:45,434 --> 00:21:48,738
Call them off for a while now.

335
00:21:49,071 --> 00:21:50,806
Harold, get them into their seats.

336
00:21:52,408 --> 00:21:54,277
All right now I call on their chickens

337
00:21:54,277 --> 00:21:56,078
To work out some kind of a compromise.

338
00:21:56,579 --> 00:22:01,350
Well, they're going to cough up their fifty
dollar refund.

339
00:22:01,951 --> 00:22:03,753
I think I can find another rat for 40 bucks.

340
00:22:03,753 --> 00:22:04,487
So does that sound?

341
00:22:04,587 --> 00:22:08,658
Well, we can only give you fifty dollars
because the other 10 was the cost on that

342
00:22:08,658 --> 00:22:09,892
item. Hmm.

343
00:22:10,092 --> 00:22:13,496
Well, I'll tell you what, I'll give you ten
bucks for the old inner tube and I'll throw

344
00:22:13,496 --> 00:22:15,197
that in. And then then we're there, right?

345
00:22:15,364 --> 00:22:17,833
Done. Done. All right.

346
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,735
Great. What we're proposing is put that
down, bill.

347
00:22:20,002 --> 00:22:25,608
What we're proposing is that Gary Starr is
going to give us 50 bucks back on the roof.

348
00:22:26,008 --> 00:22:27,143
I'm going to throw in a sob.

349
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:28,944
We're going to get another 40 from the lodge
getting.

350
00:22:29,245 --> 00:22:31,714
We can buy a new four man raft flap.

351
00:22:32,047 --> 00:22:40,423
All in favor. We're all in favor, say I.

352
00:22:42,024 --> 00:22:44,593
Motion carried. Just no other large business,
right?

353
00:22:45,461 --> 00:22:47,797
I'm going to call on Glenn here to give us
an evening's entertainment.

354
00:22:50,266 --> 00:22:51,433
Ok, thanks, Fred.

355
00:22:52,568 --> 00:22:55,638
That you don't like this.

356
00:22:56,772 --> 00:22:59,508
Well, it's nice to see Murray and Duane get
what's coming to them.

357
00:22:59,542 --> 00:23:01,043
None of their customers ever have.

358
00:23:01,911 --> 00:23:03,846
And Douglas has learned that you get what
you pay for.

359
00:23:04,446 --> 00:23:08,584
It's like my Uncle Clydesdale used to say,
if you buy the best, you'll never regret it.

360
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:12,421
But if you steal the best, you'll never
regret it and still have money for a nice

361
00:23:12,421 --> 00:23:16,225
dinner. And that's a philosophy he
maintained throughout his prison term.

362
00:23:17,193 --> 00:23:18,861
Anyway, yeah, my wife is watching.

363
00:23:18,861 --> 00:23:22,231
I'll be coming straight home after the
meeting and I'm bringing the inner tube so we

364
00:23:22,231 --> 00:23:23,632
can pop your mother out of the bathtub.

365
00:23:24,934 --> 00:23:29,104
So until next time, on behalf of myself and
Harold and the whole gang up here at Possum

366
00:23:29,104 --> 00:23:30,839
Lodge. Keep your stick on the ice.

367
00:23:36,712 --> 00:23:38,147
And that's the history of the overpass.

368
00:23:38,781 --> 00:23:39,815
Yeah, the first one, okay.

369
00:23:41,216 --> 00:23:44,420
Oh, all right. Let's see the focus.

370
00:23:45,254 --> 00:23:47,289
So gelding, farm or horses?

371
00:23:47,589 --> 00:23:49,325
Yeah, it was made Horse Race gelding.

372
00:23:50,092 --> 00:23:56,265
Yeah. The Pretty. At work or in the Arab.
