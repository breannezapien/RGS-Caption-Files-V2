12

00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:47,525
NOW, THE OLD PIPE MAY BE
RUSTED ON THERE PRETTY GOOD.

159
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:49,628
SO YOU'RE GONNA
NEED A SPECIAL WRENCH

160
00:08:49,628 --> 00:08:51,997
AND A COUPLE OF CLAMPS.

161
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:56,601
[ COUGH ]

162
00:08:56,601 --> 00:08:59,137
SAFETY GOGGLES MIGHT
HAVE BEEN A GOOD IDEA.

163
00:08:59,137 --> 00:09:01,139
I'LL JUST SQUINT MORE.

164
00:09:05,443 --> 00:09:07,612
BOY, PRETTY RUSTY
UNDER THERE.

165
00:09:07,612 --> 00:09:09,514
GOOD THING THE
FLOOR IS GONE.

166
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:11,449
I COULD HAVE SUFFOCATED.

167
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:13,618
BUT NOW WE'VE GOT OUR
FLEXIBLE PIPE IN PLACE,

168
00:09:13,618 --> 00:09:16,688
AND WE CAN AIM OUR
EXHAUST ANYWHERE WE WANT.

169
00:09:16,688 --> 00:09:19,057
KINDA LIKE WHEN
YOU WERE SINGLE.

170
00:09:19,057 --> 00:09:21,226
NOW ALL WE NEED IS
A WAY TO KEEP THE PIPE UP

171
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:23,661
AND STEER IT.

172
00:09:29,134 --> 00:09:31,803
SO NOW I HAVE MY AIMING
MECHANISM IN PLACE.

173
00:09:31,803 --> 00:09:33,405
I USED A CLOTHESLINE,

174
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:35,473
BUT YOU CAN USE THE STEERING
SYSTEM OUT OF YOUR BOAT.

175
00:09:35,473 --> 00:09:38,042
WELL, NOT YOUR BOAT,
BUT SOMEONE'S.

176
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:39,911
SO NOW WHEN I TURN
THE STEERING WHEEL,

177
00:09:39,911 --> 00:09:42,847
THE TAILPIPE IS PULLED
HORIZONTALLY AND VERTICALLY.

178
00:09:42,847 --> 00:09:45,683
SO THE TECHNOLOGY IS
TWO-DIMENSIONAL IN CHARACTER,

179
00:09:45,683 --> 00:09:47,452
MUCH LIKE MYSELF.

180
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:49,354
NOW, YOU'LL BE AIMING THROUGH
THE REARVIEW MIRROR,

181
00:09:49,354 --> 00:09:51,256
SO EVERYTHING
WILL BE BACKWARDS.

182
00:09:51,256 --> 00:09:53,158
BUT I PUT THE
HOOD ORNAMENT ON THERE

183
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:55,093
TO WORK AS A SIGHT.

184
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:05,270
OKAY...

185
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,804
WE'RE GETTIN' THERE.

186
00:10:06,804 --> 00:10:09,140
NOW ALL WE GOTTA DO IS
ADD A LITTLE FIRE POWER.

187
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,309
AND AT MY AGE THE BEST
PLACE TO LOOK FOR THAT

188
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:12,810
IS UNDER THE HOOD...

189
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,679
OF THE CAR.

190
00:10:17,182 --> 00:10:19,183
I TOOK ONE OF THE
ENGINE SPARK PLUGS,

191
00:10:19,183 --> 00:10:21,052
MOUNTED IT ON
THE MUFFLER HERE.

192
00:10:21,052 --> 00:10:22,854
HAD TO EXTEND
THE WIRE A BIT,

193
00:10:22,854 --> 00:10:24,589
NOT SURE HOW GOOD THE
CONNECTIONS ARE,

194
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:26,424
BUT I FIND WITH
REAL HIGH VOLTAGE,

195
00:10:26,424 --> 00:10:28,293
IT'S NOT ALL THAT CRUCIAL.

196
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:30,361
STUCK A PIECE OF DOWELING
INTO THE SPARK PLUG HOLE.

197
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:32,830
WANTED TO USE ONE OF THE
CORKS FROM MY WINE BOTTLE,

198
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,300
BUT IT'S THE
WRONG SIZE THREAD.

199
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,302
SEE, THE SPARK PLUG
MOUNTED HERE

200
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:39,137
ALLOWS THE GAS
TO EXPLODE IN THE MUFFLER

201
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:41,472
RATHER THAN BACK
IN THE ENGINE.

202
00:10:41,472 --> 00:10:43,508
WHY AM I DOING THIS,
YOU ASK.

203
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:46,911
WELL, YOU LIKE SKIING,
TOBOGGANING,

204
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,846
SNOWMOBILING,

205
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:50,915
A WHITE CHRISTMAS?

206
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:53,484
WELL, THEN YOU
NEED A SNOW CANNON.

207
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:58,690
NOW YOU CAN HAVE SNOW WHERE
YOU WANT AND WHEN YOU WANT

208
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,125
JUST LIKE AT THOSE
FANCY SKI RESORTS,

209
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,394
BUT AT A FRACTION
OF THE COST,

210
00:11:03,394 --> 00:11:05,363
EXCLUDING LEGAL FEES.

211
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:07,365
NOW JUST AIM YOUR TAILPIPE

212
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:10,401
AT WHEREVERYOU WANT YOUR
BLIZZARD DELIVERED.

213

YOU'LL HAVE LIFT-OFF RIGHT
AFTER IGNITION, BELIEVE ME.

214
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,149
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

215
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:27,018
THEY SHOULD AT
LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

216
00:11:27,018 --> 00:11:30,721
ACTUALLY, THIS IS ONE SNOW JOB
SHE'LL THANK YOU FOR.

WHO LOOK UP TO YOU

220
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,149
AND ASK FOR YOUR ADVICE.

221
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:00,685
THEY SEE SOMETHING
IN YOU, DON'T THEY?

222
00:12:00,685 --> 00:12:04,155
AND WE BOTH KNOW
THEY'RE WRONG.

223
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:05,990
OH, SURE, YEAH,

224
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,758
YOU USED TO KNOW
EVERYTHING.

225
00:12:07,758 --> 00:12:09,927
YOU HAD OPINIONS
ON THE WAY KIDS DRESSED,

226
00:12:09,927 --> 00:12:11,762
UNTIL YOUR KIDS
FOUND THE PICTURES OF YOU

227
00:12:11,762 --> 00:12:14,398
IN THE MADRAS CAPTAIN
WITH LEO SAYER HAIR

228
00:12:14,398 --> 00:12:16,901
AND THE MR T NECKLACES.

229
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:19,804
YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW WHAT WAS
WRONG WITH THE GOVERNMENT

UNTIL EVERY GREAT GUY
YOU VOTED INTO OFFICE

TURNED INTO A MORON.

232
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:26,944
YOU KNEW HOW ANNOYING
AND STUPID CELL PHONES WERE

233
00:12:26,944 --> 00:12:29,880
UNTIL YOUR MOTORHOME
BROKE DOWN IN UTAH.

234

YOU KNEW KIDS WERE
WASTING TIME ON COMPUTERS

00:12:32,783 --> 00:12:35,953
UNTIL YOU BOUGHT
A TRUSS ON E-BAY.

236
00:12:35,953 --> 00:12:38,189
SO NOW
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

237
00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:41,492
WELL, YOU KNOW
THAT YOU KNOW NOTHING.

238
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:43,761
JUST DON'T ADMIT IT.

239
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:45,730
IF PEOPLE COME AT YOU
WITH QUESTIONS,

240
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,798
ASK A QUESTION BACK.

QUESTIONS LIKE,
"HOW DID IT FALL?"

OR "DO YOU HAVE
ALL THE PIECES?"

OR "HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE
BEFORE YOUR WIFE GETS HOME?"

ALMOST WISH THAT IT WOULD.

[ APPLAUSE ]

293
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,509
Red: HAROLD AND WALTER HAD
GONE FOR A HIKE IN
THE WOODS, THERE.

294
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:14,945
AND WALTER HAD KIND OF
A NORMAL-SIZED BACKPACK,

295
00:15:14,945 --> 00:15:16,814
AND HAROLD WENT
THE ULTRA-DELUXE --

296
00:15:16,814 --> 00:15:18,382
FIGURES HE'S GOING
TO GET LOST.

297
00:15:18,382 --> 00:15:20,417
HE CARRIES THE MAP
AND DOESN'T ALWAYS
LOOK WHERE HE'S GOING.

298
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:23,287
STEPPED RIGHT
ON WALTER'S FOOT, THERE.

299
00:15:23,287 --> 00:15:27,357
COMES BACK THE OTHER WAY
AND REPEATS IT.

300
00:15:27,357 --> 00:15:29,293
AND HE COMES OVER
TO APOLOGIZE.

301
00:15:29,293 --> 00:15:31,094
WALTER'S NOT
THAT INTERESTED.

302
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:33,030
SO HAROLD TAKES OFF
THE BACKPACK.

303
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,232
IT'S A HEAVY UNIT.

304
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:38,101
SO THE IDEA IS THAT HE'S
GOING TO HANG IT ON A TREE.

305
00:15:38,101 --> 00:15:41,905
ALL HE NEEDS TO FIND IS
A TREE THAT HAS A NAIL IN IT.

306
00:15:41,905 --> 00:15:44,441
OH, THERE WE GO.

307
00:15:44,441 --> 00:15:46,343
AND OF COURSE, THE WEIGHT
OF THE BACKPACK

308
00:15:46,343 --> 00:15:48,579
PULLS THE TREE
RIGHT OVER.

309
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:50,647
SO HAROLD'S
A LITTLE CONCERNED.

310
00:15:50,647 --> 00:15:53,817
HE'S WONDERING IF THAT
FELL ON WALTER'S FOOT.

311
00:15:53,817 --> 00:15:56,019
APPARENTLY YES.

312
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:57,754
SO WALTER GETS
THE BANDAGE ON THERE.

313
00:15:57,754 --> 00:15:59,223
AND HAROLD'S TRYING
TO BE HELPFUL.

314
00:15:59,223 --> 00:16:00,591
BRINGS HIM ONE
OF THESE WALKING STICKS

315
00:16:00,591 --> 00:16:02,259
AND DEMONSTRATES HOW
TO USE A WALKING STICK.

316
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:03,594
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

317
00:16:03,594 --> 00:16:05,295
SO WALTER TRIES
THE WALKING STICK.

318
00:16:05,295 --> 00:16:07,864
IT DOESN'T GO REAL WELL.

319
00:16:07,864 --> 00:16:09,466
OH!

320
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:12,636
OKAY, SO WE GOT
TO GO TO PLAN B,

321
00:16:12,636 --> 00:16:15,205
WHICH IS HAROLD
CARRIES BOTH BACKPACKS,

322
00:16:15,205 --> 00:16:17,808
AND WALTER WALKS
IN A WAY THAT WILL NOT

323
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:19,776
HURT THE INJURED FOOT.

324
00:16:19,776 --> 00:16:22,312
AND HE'S PRETTY
CREATIVE THAT WALTER.

325
00:16:25,215 --> 00:16:26,717
SO THEY'RE
WALKING ALONG.

326
00:16:26,717 --> 00:16:28,218
HAROLD HEARS
A BUZZING NOISE,

327
00:16:28,218 --> 00:16:29,920
AND IT'S NOT JUST COMING
FROM HIS HEAD AS USUAL.

328
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,322
HE LOOKS UP AND THERE'S
A BEEHIVE UP THERE.

329
00:16:32,322 --> 00:16:33,623
SO HAROLD KNOWS
THE SAFEST THING TO DO

330
00:16:33,623 --> 00:16:36,526
WITH A BEEHIVE IS
TO TAP ON IT,

331
00:16:36,526 --> 00:16:38,562
BUT IT SEEMS
PRETTY SOLID.

332
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:39,896
I GUESS THEY'RE OKAY.

333
00:16:39,896 --> 00:16:41,698
AND THEN WALTER
DOESN'T NOTICE

334
00:16:41,698 --> 00:16:44,000
THAT IT ACTUALLY DROPS
OUT OF THE TREE

335
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,669
AND --
THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.

336
00:16:45,669 --> 00:16:48,739
OH BOY, OH BOY.
OH NO, OH NO.

337
00:16:48,739 --> 00:16:51,074
HOW DOES HE DO THAT?

338
00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:54,878
SO THEN HAROLD --
NO, HAROLD, NO, NO, NO.

339
00:16:54,878 --> 00:16:58,415
NOW HE'S GOING TO
SWING AND HIT IT.

340
00:16:58,415 --> 00:17:01,818
UNFORTUNATELY,
HE HITS THE FOOT.

341
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:04,955
AND THEN HE GETS -- HE DOES
GET THE PRYBAR IN THERE

342
00:17:04,955 --> 00:17:06,556
AND JUST FLIPS
IT RIGHT OUT.

343
00:17:06,556 --> 00:17:08,258
AND OKAY, WE'RE GOOD.
WE'RE GOOD, WE'RE GOOD.

344
00:17:08,258 --> 00:17:11,495
WHAT HE DOESN'T NOTICE
IS THAT IT DROPPED
INTO HIS BACKPACK.

345
00:17:11,495 --> 00:17:13,330
SO HAROLD PICKS UP
THE BACKPACK.

HAROLD AGAIN.

DO IS YOU TAKE THE TWO
