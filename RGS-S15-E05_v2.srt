00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,137
So I’m coming home from the
lodge the other night

2
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:06,706
and this guy's heading at me
with his high beams on.

3
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:08,341
So I flick my high beams
a couple of times,

4
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:11,478
but he keeps drilling
into my eyeballs like
laser surgery.

5
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,546
I couldn't see where
I was going.

6
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:15,248
Luckily,
nobody was hurt...

7
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:17,217
except the
postal system.

8
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:22,455
I figure that guy didn't
dim his lights

9
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:25,425
because he wasn't affected
by my puny high beams.

10
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:28,561
So I'm going to fight fire
with a flame thrower.

11
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:31,931
I'm going to add these
babies to the possum van.

12
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:34,567
I got them from the
Port Asbestos Arena.

13
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:36,569
Now that hockey's
on strike,

14
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,138
all they got going on
is line dancing

15
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,140
and they're afraid
if it's too bright

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,708
it'll just look like a bunch
of old, fat people

17
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,476
playing hopscotch.

18
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:46,679
You just mount those on
a piece of waterproof plywood.

19
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,082
I got this one
just up the road.

20
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,188
Now, these lights take
a while to warm up

21
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:57,390
so you just leave
them on all the time

22
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,293
and then swing them into
place when you need them.

23
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:03,396
To do that, I used a himmelman
hinge on the front edge

24
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,766
and mounted the whole unit
on a hockey stick.

25
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:09,035
The blade hangs
down inside.

26
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:10,870
All's I have to do
is pull down on it

27
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,807
when some idiot's coming
at me with his high beams.

28
00:01:14,807 --> 00:01:17,110
The bulbs'll swing up,
shoot right at him

29
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,479
helping him
see the light.

30
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:24,117
Oh sure, the arena lights
are shooting up at the
sky all the time,

31
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,718
but that's not dangerous.

32
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:28,688
We're nowhere
near the airport.

Big, big week up at
the lodge this week.

40
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:19,172
Harold's been pushing
us all to get these

41
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,940
fancy cellular phones
so I found a deal

42
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,575
and got enough
for everybody.

43
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,710
I don't know if I'm too excited
about having a cell phone,

44
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,279
but I figure if
it gets annoying,

45
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,181
it's small enough that
I can throw it

46
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,049
farther than
my ears can hear.

Yes, Harold, yes.

52
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:38,724
I wanted to call you

53
00:02:38,724 --> 00:02:40,860
but then of course
I couldn't, could I?

54
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,762
Did you get the
one I wanted?

00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:44,463
Yeah, pretty much.

With the caller I.D.
and the call forwarding

57

and the call waiting
and the personalized ring

and the text messaging
and the video capabilities,

59
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,271
did you get that?

Pretty much, yeah.
Pretty much that, yeah.

61

Did you not get the
exact make and model
that I specified?

62

No, I didn't, Harold.
Ohhhh!

63
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,386
Harold, 300 dollars
for a phone?

64
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:10,790
I can get a station wagon
for that kind of money,

65
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,224
and then I wouldn't have
to call anybody,

66
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:14,460
I'd just drive over.

67
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,696
Do you want to know
what I paid for these
babies, Harold?

68
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,464
Nothing.
Zero.

69
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,201
Nice catch.

70
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,736
It's a box of cereal.

Yeah, all different
kinds of cereal.

a free cell phone inside.

embarrassing sometimes.

76

Uncle Red, of course
the cell phone's free.

77
00:03:39,985 --> 00:03:42,254
It's the activation fee
and the time rate

78
00:03:42,254 --> 00:03:44,824
that they're going
to charge so much on.

79
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,559
There's going
to be no savings.

I'm not going to activate
my phone, Harold.

Instead of using their
cellular towers to
relay my calls,

of cereal should I get?

And I certainly hope it has
nothing to do with explosives

00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,980
because I know you've
had some bad experiences
with those.

152
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,684
Yeah, well, sometimes
I get carried away.

153
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,286
Sometimes buildings
get carried away.

154
00:07:01,286 --> 00:07:02,988
But not my hobby.

155
00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:05,624
I have a gentle,
creative hobby.

156
00:07:05,624 --> 00:07:07,192
Oh excellent.
Oh, that's perfect.

157
00:07:07,192 --> 00:07:08,593
That's exactly what
I was hoping for.

158
00:07:08,593 --> 00:07:12,230
You know, an example
of a hobby that shows
the balance in one's life.

was interesting.

161
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:19,838
Oh, trains,
and what is it,
specifically,

162
00:07:19,838 --> 00:07:21,340
that you love
about trains?

163
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,443
I love the way
they flatten stuff.

164
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:26,978
Yes, yes, oh yeah,

165
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:28,347

and stuff, right?

166
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:31,883
Oh, tut-tut, Harold,
coins are for amateurs.

167
00:07:31,883 --> 00:07:34,252
How about...

168
00:07:34,252 --> 00:07:37,255
a wristwatch?

169
00:07:37,255 --> 00:07:39,257
Now, this is art.

170
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:42,494

"'A' Train On Time."

171
00:07:42,494 --> 00:07:45,030
Very rare.

172
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,065
That's cool, Edgar.

173
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:48,733
I also tried
other items...

174
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:51,536
like a stapler.

175
00:07:51,536 --> 00:07:54,172
Wow, that's --
that's a stapler.

176
00:07:54,172 --> 00:07:56,041
I tried one without
opening it up

177
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,843
but it was too tall
and tapered,

178
00:07:57,843 --> 00:07:59,644
so when the big
steel wheel hit it,

179
00:07:59,644 --> 00:08:04,749
it shot out like a bullet
right through the windshield

180
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:07,552
Hey, I saw that
on the news!

181
00:08:07,552 --> 00:08:09,321
Yeah?

182
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:12,057
Uh, everybody's fine
as far as I know.

183
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:13,658
Oh yeah, yeah...

184
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:16,928
but Edgar, do you
notice any similarities

185
00:08:16,928 --> 00:08:18,830
between your chosen
profession

186
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,032
and the hobby
you've selected?

187
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:23,668
Oh, yes I do,
Harold.

188
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:27,038
They both take
place outdoors.

189
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,575
Even if I start my
explosive work indoors...

190
00:08:30,575 --> 00:08:32,544
well, it doesn't
stay there very long.

191

No, not really.
No, no.

192
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:35,947
But you know,
I was talking more about

193
00:08:35,947 --> 00:08:37,482
the destructive
component of each.

194
00:08:37,482 --> 00:08:39,517
I find it
very disturbing.

195
00:08:39,517 --> 00:08:43,588
It's a small world, Harold,
and it's getting smaller.

197
00:08:47,225 --> 00:08:48,960
Edgar, I'm just a little
concerned about the message

198
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,762
we're sending out
to our viewing audience,

199
00:08:50,762 --> 00:08:53,031
you know, particularly
our younger viewers

200
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:56,368
because you do
dangerous things.

201
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:58,637
Oh, all right.

202
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:01,840
All you kids out there,
don't be blowing stuff up,

203
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,309
and don't be
putting things on
the railroad tracks.

204
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:07,045
It's very dangerous...

205
00:09:10,482 --> 00:09:13,418
especially if you
stand too close.

206
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:22,894
You ever seen
these hot rod magazines

207
00:09:22,894 --> 00:09:25,897
with pictures in them
that are supposed to
make you jealous?

208
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:27,999
Now, there are other kinds
of men's magazines

209
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:29,434
that have pictures
in them

210
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:31,202
but they're supposed to
make your wife jealous.

211
00:09:31,202 --> 00:09:32,737
Neither one works,

212

like this.

Some guy doing
a massive burnout

214
00:09:37,675 --> 00:09:39,277
with smoke pouring
off the tires

215
00:09:39,277 --> 00:09:41,146
really gets my attention.

216
00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:42,647
And if it doesn't,

217
00:09:42,647 --> 00:09:45,116
your testosterone
may be down a quart.

218
00:09:47,886 --> 00:09:49,254
to pull off a
stunt like that.

219
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:51,122
The only major peeling
I've ever done

220
00:09:51,122 --> 00:09:53,858
involves an unplanned
nap on the beach.

221
00:09:53,858 --> 00:09:56,127
But maybe we can look like
we're peeling rubber,

222
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:57,762
even though we're not,

223
00:09:57,762 --> 00:09:59,631
'cause when a car does
a massive burnout,

224
00:09:59,631 --> 00:10:00,965
it's not going fast,

225
00:10:00,965 --> 00:10:02,800
it just creeps along
with the tires squealing

226
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,369
and the smoke fuming.

227
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:07,105
Maybe there's another
way to do that.

228
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:08,973
I mounted a fire
extinguisher

229
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:10,875
with the nozzle pointing
down through the floor

230
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,945
right at the wheel.

231
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:16,614
And I can turn the unit on
from the driver's seat

232
00:10:16,614 --> 00:10:18,850
using that cable.

233
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,919
That'll provide
the smoke.

234
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:23,154
I didn't even have
to cut a hole in the floor,

235
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:26,124
as she's rusted out
in exactly the right spot.

236
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:29,127
Another reason
to buy domestic.

237
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:31,529
And as for the sound
of the squealing tires,

238
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:33,531
I've got no pads left
on these brakes

239
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:35,300
so I just put the
brakes on a little,

240
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,937
and she'll scream like
a parrot sitting on
a jalapeño.

241
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:40,972
And you don't have to worry
about the brakelights

out years ago.

Got to love domestic.

245
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:50,281
Okay, maybe doing a fake
peel out isn't exactly honest,

246
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:53,451
but for men my age,
truth is a last resort.

247

And the beauty
of this system,

00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,326
it doesn't wear
out your tires.

[ BRAKES SQUEALING ]

250
00:11:17,575 --> 00:11:19,544
You know, after
39 years of marriage,

251
00:11:19,544 --> 00:11:21,012
I've learned one thing,

252
00:11:21,012 --> 00:11:23,448
which puts me ahead
of most guys.

253
00:11:23,448 --> 00:11:27,185
If you and your wife want
your marriage to survive
the long haul,

254
00:11:27,185 --> 00:11:30,221
you've got to argue.

255
00:11:30,221 --> 00:11:32,223
I don't mean yelling
and screaming

256

like a big baby,

elected representative.

258
00:11:37,128 --> 00:11:40,198
I mean the simple act of
actually telling your spouse

259
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:41,699
what's bugging you,

260
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:45,369
rather than laying on
a thick layer of sarcasm.

261
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:47,238
For instance, instead of
your wife asking you

262
00:11:47,238 --> 00:11:49,874
not to leave your stuff
on the floor, she'll say,

263
00:11:49,874 --> 00:11:51,242
"Hey now,

264
00:11:51,242 --> 00:11:54,846
"there's an interesting
place to keep your underwear."

265
00:11:54,846 --> 00:11:57,315
Or like instead of asking for
your help with the dishes,

266
00:11:57,315 --> 00:12:00,384
she'll say, "Are you sure
you can hear the ball game

"over all this
running water?"

But guys are no better

except men tend to do it with
actions rather than words.

270
00:12:08,793 --> 00:12:12,830
A guy won't say
"I'd rather be golfing
than visiting your mother,"

I wasn't quite
sure what he --

361

There, it looks more like
a fitness thing

minute too soon.

363

But Dalton has something going
on under that shirt and I --

364
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,049
You know, you see
stuff like that

and you don't know
whether to comment or --

You figure he's got to be
aware of it, you know.

367
00:15:56,687 --> 00:15:59,823
But of course, Ed felt
he had to point out

368
00:15:59,823 --> 00:16:02,025
that there was some sort of
an aberration there,

369

00:16:03,694 --> 00:16:05,329
and then they see
what's happening.

is a yoga lesson.

She's going to get them to be
all flexible and relaxed.

All right, let's try
something that you can do.

384
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,628
I say, let's try
lying on our back.

385
00:16:38,628 --> 00:16:41,264
Very good, excellent,
excellent, perfect.

386
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:44,935
Now, legs up,
over and...

387
00:16:44,935 --> 00:16:46,937
and this is something
the guys found very easy

388
00:16:46,937 --> 00:16:51,108
to watch.

389
00:16:51,108 --> 00:16:55,579
And then up into some kind
of a stand and...

390
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:57,647
again, fascinated.

391
00:16:57,647 --> 00:17:00,851
So now this is a flexibility
on the spine

392
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:03,754
and you turn your head right
around like that and...

393
00:17:03,754 --> 00:17:06,656
Well, they're willing
to meet her halfway,

394
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:08,425
but that's about it.

00:17:08,425 --> 00:17:10,193
And oh, good.

00:17:10,193 --> 00:17:12,429
Yes, very good.

397
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:14,998
And the other side...

398
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,536
And perfect.

Okay, now they move on
to where you work in couples

which is why so many
yoga people have kids.

sits Dalton down.

403
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,349

have to duplicate

enjoying the day and...

408
00:17:40,957 --> 00:17:44,194
They lean right back over
on the person

409
00:17:44,194 --> 00:17:47,264
and relax totally
on them and so...

Mike's in for
a rough go here.

411

Now, this is an
interesting position.

412
00:17:55,405 --> 00:17:57,173
You put your toes together

413
00:17:57,173 --> 00:17:59,576
and then you bring your feet
up in between your arms,

414
00:17:59,576 --> 00:18:01,478
and it's a
very elegant look,

415
00:18:01,478 --> 00:18:03,046
and isn't that great, eh?

416
00:18:03,046 --> 00:18:04,648
Now, that doesn't
go so well --

417

Oh, oh, oh.

the weight of your partner,

his shirt was on fire,

but it wasn't.

439
00:19:05,442 --> 00:19:07,811
No, see, we thought Dalton
typed us a message that said,

"shirt on fire."

441

You know, as men,

all the men would stand...
just stand.
