NOTHING PLEASES ME MORE

00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:07,039
THAN TO TAKE
EXISTING TECHNOLOGY

3
00:00:07,072 --> 00:00:09,708
AND USE IT IN AN
ENTIRELY NEW APPLICATION.

THIS IS THE HIGHEST FORM
OF CREATIVITY,

WE NEVER READ INSTRUCTIONS.

00:00:16,515 --> 00:00:18,717
LIKE, THIS HERE'S
A WINDOW BLIND, EH?

7
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:21,920
WHEN YOU PULL THIS DOWN,
YOU CAN COVER THE WINDOW,

HER A LITTLE TUG,

THAT MAKES THIS UNIT INTO
A LITTLE MACHINE.

12
00:00:31,397 --> 00:00:34,767
AND I'M THINKING JUST USING
SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO
COVER A WINDOW

13
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,568
IS A WASTE OF MACHINERY.

I'VE ACTUALLY ATTACHED A BLIND
TO THESE TWO HOCKEY STICKS.

19
00:00:49,214 --> 00:00:51,116
AND THEN I PULLED HER DOWN
TO THE END OF THE TABLE

20

AND LOCKED HER BEFORE
WE HAD THE PICNIC.

WATCHING THE SHOW,

310
00:13:50,128 --> 00:13:52,463
LA LA LA.

311
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,299
WELL, WE GOT PEOPLE
LIKE ME WATCHING.

312
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:56,134
WE JUST DON'T HAVE
PEOPLE LIKE YOU WATCHING.

313
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:58,636
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
PROUD OF THAT.

314
00:13:58,703 --> 00:14:00,305
BUT UNCLE RED, I CHECKED WITH
THE NEILSON PEOPLE,

315
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:02,273
AND OUR RATINGS WHEN YOU WERE
ARGUING WITH DALTON,

316
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,809
OUR RATINGS WERE WAY
UP ON THAT FIRST SEGMENT.

317
00:14:04,876 --> 00:14:06,611
WE'RE DEFINITELY ON
THE RIGHT TRACK HERE.

318
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:08,313
BOY, I DON'T
THINK SO, HAROLD.

319
00:14:08,346 --> 00:14:11,049
OKAY,
WE ARE WALKING.

320
00:14:11,115 --> 00:14:12,851
YOU COULD USE
THE EXERCISE.

321
00:14:14,219 --> 00:14:16,421
NO, HE MEANS WE'RE
WALKING FROM THE SHOW.

322
00:14:16,454 --> 00:14:17,789
WE DON'T LIKE
THE TENSION;

323
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,657
WE DON'T LIKE
THE ANIMOSITY;

324
00:14:19,724 --> 00:14:21,259
IT'S TOO MUCH LIKE
BEING AT WORK.

325
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:23,161
IT'S TOO MUCH LIKE
BEING AT HOME.

326
00:14:23,194 --> 00:14:24,996
WELL, I'M SORRY, YOU'RE
BOTH UNDER CONTRACT.

327
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:26,631
YOU CAN'T LEAVE.

328
00:14:26,698 --> 00:14:30,001
YEAH? WELL, YOU KNOW WHERE
YOU CAN STICK YOUR CONTRACT.

329
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:32,303
GIVE ME A CALL IF
YOU NEED SOME HELP

330
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,873
GETTING IT BACK OUT.

331
00:14:34,906 --> 00:14:37,208
COME ON, WINSTON.

332
00:14:37,242 --> 00:14:41,379
OH, UNCLE RED,
THIS IS GREAT TELEVISION!

333
00:14:41,446 --> 00:14:43,214
WELL, YOU'LL LOVE
THIS NEXT PART...

334
00:14:43,281 --> 00:14:45,416
I'M WITH THEM.

335
00:14:45,483 --> 00:14:47,952
[ LAUGHTER ]

336
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:53,458
Red (voice over)
WALTER WAS DRIVING OUT 
BY PORT ASBESTOS. 

337
00:14:53,491 --> 00:14:56,661
HE HAD A BIG LOAD ON THE 
TRAILER AND HE HAD HIS 
LITTLE K-CAR. 

338
00:14:56,694 --> 00:14:59,397
NOT AS RELIANT AS THE 
NAME SOMETIMES.
 

339
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:02,800
JUST A LITTLE FOUR-BANGER, 
JUST STARTING TO OVERHEAT 
A LITTLE BIT, 

340
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:05,770
AND HE PULLED OVER 
AND DIDN'T REALLY GET
 
TOO FAR OFF THE ROAD.

341
00:15:05,803 --> 00:15:07,805
I DON'T KNOW WHY MEN FEEL 
THEY HAVE TO OPEN THE HOOD
 

342
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,142
WHENEVER THEY SEE 
SOMETHING BAD HAPPENING. 

343
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:13,411
A LOT OF SMOKE 
AND STEAM THERE, 

344
00:15:13,444 --> 00:15:15,380
AND DALTON WAS COMING 
ALONG UP THE ROAD
 

345
00:15:15,446 --> 00:15:17,448
AND THE SMOKE WAS KIND 
OF COMING OUT THE 
WRONG WAY THERE, 

346
00:15:17,515 --> 00:15:20,618
ANY HE KIND OF LOST WALTER 
IN THE VIEW AND -- 

347
00:15:20,685 --> 00:15:22,287
NEXT -- 

348
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:28,793
SO WALTER --I SHOULD SAY 
DALTON WAS FEELING A 
LITTLE GUILTY, 

349
00:15:28,826 --> 00:15:30,695
AND HE FELT HE SHOULD TOW 
THE WHOLE SHABANG,
 
 

350
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:34,198
SO HE TIED THAT UP THERE 
AND GOT WALTER IN THERE.
 

351
00:15:34,232 --> 00:15:36,501
HE HAD A LITTLE 
MORE POWERFUL CAR. 

352
00:15:36,534 --> 00:15:39,270
BUT HE GAVE HER A FEW 
GOOD REVS AND POPPED THE
 
CLUTCH AND WHAT HAVE YOU,

353
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:40,939
BUT AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT 

354
00:15:40,972 --> 00:15:44,108
HE ENDED UP DOING THE SAME 
THING TO HIS ENGINE,  

355
00:15:44,142 --> 00:15:46,010
SO THE TWO OF THEM WENT 
OVER AND THEY BOTH THOUGHT 

356
00:15:46,044 --> 00:15:48,947
THEY WOULD OPEN THE HOOD 
AND SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON, 

357
00:15:49,013 --> 00:15:50,882
AND THEY GOT EVEN 
MORE SMOKE NOW.
 

358
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:52,650
NOW I WAS COMING ALONG. 

359
00:15:52,717 --> 00:15:54,852
OF COURSE, I PUT THE WIPERS 
ON THINKING THAT MIGHT HELP,
 

360
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:55,820
BUT NO. 

361
00:15:57,455 --> 00:15:59,724
AND THAT WAS UNFORTUNATE. 

362
00:16:02,727 --> 00:16:06,531
SO NOW, UH, MY UNIT A LITTLE 
NEWER, A LITTLE MORE POWER,
 

363
00:16:06,564 --> 00:16:09,634
I FIGURE I CAN PULL BOTH OF 
THEM PLUS THE TRAILER.
 

364
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:12,036
THIS SHOULD BE GOOD. 

365
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:14,439
SO I REVVED HER UP PRETTY 
GOOD AND EVERYTHING,
 

366
00:16:14,472 --> 00:16:16,541
BUT I THINK I WAS 
UNDERESTIMATING THE LOAD.
 

367
00:16:16,574 --> 00:16:21,179
THEN WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT, 
AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT,  

368
00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:25,216
SHE STARTED OVERHEATING AND 
THE BUNCH OF THEM CAME UP,
 

369
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:28,252
AND WE ALL OPENED THE HOOD 
TO TAKE A LOOK INSIDE THERE, 

370
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:31,155
AND WE'RE GETTING A 
LOT OF SMOKE HERE,
 

371
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:34,359
MIKE, COME ALONG IN 
A POLICE CRUISER HE
 
BORROWED TEMPORARILY.

372
00:16:34,425 --> 00:16:37,528
AND, WELL, 
YOU KNOW THE REST. 

373
00:16:38,863 --> 00:16:40,932
THAT WAS UNFORTUNATE. 

374
00:16:46,304 --> 00:16:48,106
NOW WE'RE THINKING WITH THE 
POLICE CRUISER
 

375
00:16:48,172 --> 00:16:51,109
WE MAY ACTUALLY HAVE A SHOT 
AT PULLING THREE --
 

376
00:16:51,142 --> 00:16:52,944
NOW WE HAVE FOUR CARS 
AND A TRAILER.
 

377
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:55,613
BUT THEY GOT THE BIG EIGHT 
AND THEY GOT THE RACING 
CAM IN THEM. 

378
00:16:55,646 --> 00:16:59,417
YOU'D THINK A COP CAR HAS 
USUALLY GOT THE KIND
 
OF POWER --

379
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:02,954
BUT HERE, AGAIN, 
AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT, 

380
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:05,256
HE ENDED UP-- 
NO, MIKE!
 

381
00:17:05,323 --> 00:17:07,392
DON'T -- GOTTA STOP HIM. 
GOTTA STOP HIM, 

382
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,028
BAD THINGS 
HAPPEN WHEN YOU -- 

383
00:17:10,094 --> 00:17:12,163
HERE COMES WINSTON IN 
THE SEWAGE TRUCK.  

384
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,531
SO WE'RE THINKING, 
OKAY, OKAY. 

385
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:15,199
WE GOT A BETTER IDEA. 

386
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:17,835
THIS WHOLE -- THIS WHOLE 
TOWING THING AIN'T WORKING.
 

387
00:17:17,902 --> 00:17:19,904
HERE'S A BETTER WAY TO GO, 

388
00:17:19,937 --> 00:17:23,975
AND SO THERE GOES MIKE, 
AND HE'S PULLING UP ON ME, 

389
00:17:24,008 --> 00:17:26,377
AND THEN RIGHT BEHIND ME 
WE GOT DALTON. 

390
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:29,547
AND THEN, OF COURSE, WE GOT 
WALTER WITH THE TRAILER.
 

391
00:17:29,614 --> 00:17:31,749
AND WE'RE ALL 
ON OUR MERRY WAY 

392
00:17:31,783 --> 00:17:33,518
BECAUSE WE LEARNED A
IFE LESSON THERE...

393
00:17:33,584 --> 00:17:35,219
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW 
MUCH PULL YOU HAVE,
 
 

394
00:17:35,286 --> 00:17:37,221
SOMETIMES, YOU NEED A PUSH. 

395
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:41,259
[ APPLAUSE ]

396
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:51,469
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE PROBLEMS
ABOUT LIVING UP IN THE
NORTHERN REGIONS --

397
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:54,705
I MEAN, ASIDE FROM THE
BLACK FLIES, THE MOSQUITOES

398
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:57,975
AND THE LOUSY SERVICES

399
00:17:58,042 --> 00:18:01,579
AND THE BONE-NUMBING COLD --

400
00:18:01,646 --> 00:18:04,082
IS THE SHORTNESS
OF THE SEASONS.

401
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:05,750
YEAH, ESPECIALLY THE SPRING.

402
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:07,785
SO EVERY YEAR
MY WIFE BERNICE,

403
00:18:07,852 --> 00:18:10,822
GETS ME TO GET HER SEEDS
STARTED ON THESE LITTLE TRAYS,

404
00:18:10,855 --> 00:18:13,724
YOU KNOW, WITH THE LIGHT
SHINING DOWN OVER TOP.

405
00:18:13,758 --> 00:18:16,094
BUT I'LL TELL YOU, BY THE TIME
THEY'RE READY TO BE PLANTED,

406
00:18:16,127 --> 00:18:17,795
SO AM I.

407
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:22,200
SO I FIGURE, IF I PUT A CAR
WINDSHIELD ON THERE,

408
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:24,869
THAT'LL KIND OF
MAGNIFY THE LIGHT

409
00:18:24,902 --> 00:18:28,339
AND GIVE THE SEEDS A TURBO
BOOST OF ULTRA-VIOLET.

410
00:18:28,372 --> 00:18:30,608
YOU KNOW I'M JUST SPEEDING
UP NATURE A LITTLE BIT,

411
00:18:30,641 --> 00:18:33,344
SORT OF LIKE WHAT ALCOHOL
DOES AT A WEDDING.

412
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:37,115
OKAY, BUT THAT'S
JUST THE BEGINNING.

413
00:18:37,148 --> 00:18:38,749
SURE, WE CAN MAGNIFY
THE LIGHT,

414
00:18:38,816 --> 00:18:41,486
BUT, HEY, LET'S START
WITH A BIGGER LIGHT.

415
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:44,288
NOW, I'M NOT GOING TO SAY
WHERE I GOT THAT LIGHT,

416
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:47,525
BUT IF YOU'RE PLANNING TO
LAND A PLANE AT PORT
ASBESTOS AIRPORT,

417
00:18:47,592 --> 00:18:51,062
WELL, I WOULD SUGGEST YOU
ARRIVE DURING THE DAY.

418
00:18:51,095 --> 00:18:54,165
ALRIGHTY, LET'S GIVE MOTHER
NATURE A KICK START.

419
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,516
( in deep talkshow voice )
HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME BACK

420
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:14,051
TO THE NEXT EXCITING AND
CONTROVERSIAL SEGMENT OF

421
00:19:14,085 --> 00:19:17,088
"THE HAROLD GREEN SHOW"!

00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,226
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

423
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:26,430
WELCOME BACK TO THE FINALE
OF MY REALITY-BASED SHOW.

424
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:30,001
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF TENSION UP
AT THE LODGE THIS WEEK,

425
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:32,303
AND THAT'S GOOD.
BECAUSE TENSION'S GOOD.

426
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,238
IT'S ENTERTAINING.

427
00:19:34,305 --> 00:19:36,073
AND IT'S WHAT PEOPLE
WANT TO SEE.

428
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,675
(whispering)
IT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANNA SEE.

429
00:19:39,076 --> 00:19:40,978
AND THERE'S NOTHING
LIKE THE TENSION

430
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:42,680
BETWEEN THE CHARACTERS ON
THE SHOW, YOU KNOW THE --

( voice shaking )
BIG WEEK AT THE LODGE
THIS WEEK, UM --

433
00:20:03,568 --> 00:20:05,670
BUSTER HADFIELD FELL
ON A CONVEYOR BELT

434
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:08,105
AT THE SOFT DRINK FACTORY
AND GOT HIS SKULL CAPPED ---

435
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:10,608
HAROLD, WE CAN'T
LET YOU DO THIS!

436
00:20:10,675 --> 00:20:12,210
ME NEITHER.

437
00:20:12,243 --> 00:20:14,078
THE RATINGS DON'T
MATTER, HAROLD.

438
00:20:14,145 --> 00:20:15,546
YOU CAN'T FORCE
PEOPLE TO CHANGE.

439
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,914
I KNOW THAT NOW.

440
00:20:16,948 --> 00:20:18,249
WE LIKED IT THE
WAY IT WAS BEFORE!

441
00:20:18,316 --> 00:20:19,684
ME TOO.

442
00:20:19,717 --> 00:20:21,419
WHEN YOU'RE IN THE
SEWAGE BUSINESS,

443
00:20:21,452 --> 00:20:23,454
YOU LEARN THAT EVERYBODY
HAS THEIR BAD SIDE.

444
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:25,456
I'M WITH YOU A 100%.
I REALLY AM.

445
00:20:25,523 --> 00:20:27,758
YOU KNOW, HAROLD, IT DOESN'T
MAKE FOR MUCH OF AN
ARGUMENT,

446
00:20:27,792 --> 00:20:29,327
IF YOU DON'T DISAGREE.

447
00:20:29,393 --> 00:20:31,028
PEOPLE MAY
STOP WATCHING.

448
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:32,597
WELL, I DON'T CARE!

449
00:20:32,663 --> 00:20:34,031
I KNOW I WAS WRONG,
AND I ADMIT THAT, OKAY?

450
00:20:34,098 --> 00:20:35,800
I'D LIKE TO SAY
THAT TO UNCLE RED,

451
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:37,401
BUT I HAVE NO
IDEA WHERE HE IS.

452
00:20:37,435 --> 00:20:39,337
APOLOGY ACCEPTED, HAROLD.

453
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,606
OH! IT'S UNCLE RED!
IT'S UNCLE RED!

454
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:43,007
IT'S
ALL RIGHT.

455
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,376
I STARTED
TALKING AND --

456
00:20:45,443 --> 00:20:47,078
IT'S FINE.
