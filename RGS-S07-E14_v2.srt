1
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:10,377
IT'S THE "NEW RED GREEN SHOW!"

2
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:12,779
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

3
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,681
AND NOW HERE HE IS
THE LION IN WINTER,

4
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,916
MORE LIKELY LYING ON
THE LIVING ROOM
COUCH ACTUALLY.

5
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:18,184
YOUR HOST,
YOUR HERO,
MY UNCLE,

6
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:21,020
RED GR-E-E-E-N.

7
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:30,864
(APPLAUSE)

8
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:30,997
THANK YOU.

9
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,301
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

10
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,003
OH, BOY.

11
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:39,372
ALL RIGHT, APPRECIATE IT.
APPRECIATE IT.

12
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,508
BIG, BIG WEEK UP AT
THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

13
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:44,144
POSSUM LAKE IS FINALLY
FROZEN RIGHT OVER.

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,879
NO, NO, IT DOESN'T
REALLY FREEZE,

15
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:47,680
IT CONGEALS.

16
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,349
HEY, WELL
WHATEVER, HAROLD,

17
00:00:49,415 --> 00:00:52,452
THE THING IS WE CAN
SKATE ON IT NOW, MAN.

18
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,388
OF COURSE, THE PROBLEM NOW
IS WE'VE GOT THESE YUPPIE
COTTAGERS UP HERE.

19
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:56,923
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WANT
TO DO ON THE LAKE?

20
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,392
THEY WANT TO GO CURLING.

21
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:01,928
NO, NO, THAT'S EXCELLENT!
OH, NO, CURLING'S EXCELLENT!

22
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,129
IT'S A GREAT SPORT.

23
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,064
OH, YEAH, YOU SHOULD TRY
CURLING, UNCLE RED, YEAH.

24
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:10,036
HAROLD, IF BERNICE SEES ME
WITH A BROOM IN MY HAND,
IT'S ALL OVER, BUDDY.

25
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:12,739
SO WE GOT THE CLASSIC ARGUMENT
GOING ON NOW, YOU KNOW.

26
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:14,107
'CAUSE WE WANT TO
BE PLAYING HOCKEY,

27
00:01:14,173 --> 00:01:15,642
AND THEY WANT
TO BE CURLING.

28
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:18,778
SO IT'S LIKE THE CATTLE RANCHERS
AGAINST THE SHEEP FARMERS.

29
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:22,949
WELL, DON'T LET THEM PULL
THE WOOL OVER YOUR ICE.

30
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:26,152
WOOL OVER YOUR ICE,
I SAID TO HIM.

31
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:31,224
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE WOOL OVER
YOUR EYES BUT IT'S DIFFERENT.

32
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,393
I SAID THAT.

33
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:36,496
IT'S EASY FOR YOU,
YOU CAN CHANGE CHANNELS.

34
00:01:36,562 --> 00:01:38,097
(APPLAUSE)

35
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:52,545
[♪♪♪]

36
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,781
Red Green:
HERE'S A FEW SCENES
FROM THIS WEEK'S SHOW.

37
00:01:54,847 --> 00:01:56,349
AS YOU CAN SEE
WE'RE GOING WITH...

38
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,985
KIND OF A WINTER THEME
FROM BEGINNING TO END,

39
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,454
GETTIN' INTO ALL
DIFFERENT TYPES OF SPORTS.

40
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,556
HERE'S ONE TYPE OF
SPORT RIGHT THERE.

41
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,925
BUT DON'T WORRY, WE'RE STILL
GOING DOWNHILL FAST.

42
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:14,167
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

43
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:16,869
YOU KNOW,
UNCLE RED --

44
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:19,105
UNCLE RED, I DIDN'T THINK
YOU HAD TO BE SO RUDE
TO THOSE CURLERS.

45
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,073
OH, HAROLD, THEY WERE
ASKING FOR IT.

46
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,675
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY
WERE WEARING?

47
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,812
MATCHING SWEATERS.

48
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:27,513
I THOUGHT THEY LOOKED SHARP.

49
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,316
YEAH, YEAH, YOU THINK
ACNE LOOKS SHARP.

50
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:31,784
ANYWAY, HAROLD,
I WAS MORE THAN FAIR.

51
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,553
I OFFERED THEM
A FAIR COMPROMISE.

52
00:02:33,619 --> 00:02:37,356
YEAH, YOU SAID THEY
COULD USE THE RINK FROM
MIDNIGHT UNTIL DAWN.

53
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:40,159
THAT'S WHEN THE ICE
IS THE BEST.

54
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:42,195
HOW ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT'S
PITCH BLACK AND THERE'S NO
LIGHTS OUT THERE?

55
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:44,397
YOU DON'T NEED
TO SEE TO CURL, HAROLD.

56
00:02:44,463 --> 00:02:46,799
ALL YOU NEED IS A
HIGH BOREDOM TOLERANCE,

57
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:48,868
AND MATCHING SWEATERS.

58
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,771
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

59
00:02:51,837 --> 00:02:54,507
ANYWAY, WE CAME UP
WITH A PRETTY GOOD
SOLUTION I THINK.

60
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:55,741
OH, YEAH.
OKAY, OKAY.

61
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:56,709
KNOW WHAT THEIR
SOLUTION WAS?

62
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:57,677
I'LL TELL YOU
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW.

63
00:02:57,743 --> 00:02:59,245
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?

64
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,948
ALL THE GUYS FROM POSSUM LODGE
CHALLENGED THE CURLERS
TO A HOCKEY GAME,

65
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:04,317
AND WHOEVER WINS GETS
FIRST DIBS ON THE ICE.

66
00:03:04,383 --> 00:03:05,851
YEAH, WE'RE GONNA
BEAT THEM SO BAD

67
00:03:05,918 --> 00:03:08,921
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO
FLY HOME ON THEIR BROOMS.

68
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:10,489
YEAH, YEAH, WENT UP
TO THE ATTIC THERE,

69
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:12,058
GOT OUT ALL MY
OLD HOCKEY EQUIPMENT.

70
00:03:12,124 --> 00:03:13,926
I USED TO PLAY FOR THE POSSUM
LAKE INDUSTRIAL LEAGUE.

71
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:20,566
(APPLAUSE)

72
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:21,734
DON'T!

73
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:29,108
DO NOT
ENCOURAGE HIM!

74
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,576
DO NOT DO THAT.

75
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,845
HAROLD,
HAROLD,
HAROLD.
THIS IS DISGUSTING.

76
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,213
DO NOT.

77
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,549
HAROLD.
HAROLD.

78
00:03:36,615 --> 00:03:38,818
WE WERE SPONSORED
BY A BREWERY,

79
00:03:38,884 --> 00:03:40,353
THAT'S ALL, OKAY?

80
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:42,655
IT SURE CAME IN HANDY WHEN WE
HAD TO FLOOD THE RINK.

81
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,358
I STILL THINK
IT'S DISGUSTING.

82
00:03:45,424 --> 00:03:46,592
WHAT ELSE YOU
GOT IN THERE?

83
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,294
LIKE, GUNS AND
KNIVES AND MACE

84
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,229
AND BRASS KNUCKLES?

85
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:55,234
JUST MY JOCK,
I THINK.

86
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,273
♪♪ OH, A HORSE WITH A HORN
IS CALLED A UNICORN ♪

87
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,843
♪ AND A HORSE WITH STRIPES

THE POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

91
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,125

93
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,963

(BLOWING)

97
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,739
NO WONDER HE DONATED IT.
THE THING'S BROKE.

98
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:37,276
UNLESS, OF COURSE, I JUST GOT
SOME CORN CHIPS STUCK IN THERE
FROM MY RETAINER AGAIN.

99
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,211
(BLOWING)

100
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:44,516

101
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,252
UNCLE RED.
YEAH.

YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS TO GET
Mr. DALTON HUMPHREY TO
SAY THIS WORD...

103
00:04:50,856 --> 00:04:51,957
COMPROMISE.

104
00:04:53,225 --> 00:04:55,594
COMPROMISE.

105
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:56,829
AND GO.

106
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,564
ALL RIGHT, DALTON,
A HAPPY MEDIUM...

107
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,799
THE AMAZING KRESKIN!

108
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:03,636
WHEN SOMETHING
IS 50/50...

109
00:05:03,702 --> 00:05:05,771
100!

110
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,172
OKAY, OKAY.

111
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:08,073
LET'S SAY YOU AND YOUR WIFE
HAVE AN ARGUMENT...

112
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,975
NORMAL.

113
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:13,312
OKAY, OKAY, BUT YOU COME
TO AN AGREEMENT AFTER A
DISCUSSION, OKAY?

114
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:14,246
THERE'S BEEN A...

115
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:16,515
MIRACLE.

116
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,384
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

117
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,519
YOU DECIDE TO DO
WHATEVER SHE SAYS, OKAY?

118
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:21,954
BECAUSE YOU...

119
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,723
MISUNDERSTOOD.

120
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:29,628
OKAY, THE SECRET TO GETTING THE
TWO OF YOU TO GET ALONG IS TO...

121
00:05:29,695 --> 00:05:33,766
THREATEN TO CUT OFF BEDROOM
FAVOURS FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR.

122
00:05:33,832 --> 00:05:37,369
YOU KNOW SHE HATES IT
WHEN I THREATEN THAT.

123
00:05:37,436 --> 00:05:39,104
WE'RE ALMOST
OUT OF TIME, UNCLE RED.

124
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:40,239
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

125
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:41,640
DALTON,

126
00:05:41,707 --> 00:05:43,142
YOU AND YOUR WIFE
GO INTO A FURNITURE STORE,

127
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,711
AND SHE LIKES ONE COUCH BUT YOU
LIKE ANOTHER COUCH, OKAY?

128
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:46,645
SO YOU MAKE A...

129
00:05:46,712 --> 00:05:48,147
SCENE!

130
00:05:48,213 --> 00:05:49,181
SPECTACLE!

131
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:50,482
A HUGE PRODUCTION.

132
00:05:50,549 --> 00:05:52,184
NO, LET'S GO
ANOTHER WAY.

133
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,952
YOU DEMAND
TO BUY YOUR COUCH.

134
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:56,822
THEN YOUR WIFE SAYS,
"DALTON, YOU'LL HAVE
TO LEARN TO..."

135
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,458
SLEEP ON YOUR
STUPID COUCH.

136
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,726
AND I SAY, "FINE,"

137
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:01,827
AND SHE SAYS, "FINE,"

138
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:02,895
AND THEN WE GET
INTO AN ARGUMENT,

139
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:03,996
AND I POINT OUT
HOW SHE'S WRONG,

140
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:05,464
AND THEN SHE POINTS OUT
HOW I'M WRONG,

141
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,166
AND WE JUST
GET STEAMED,

142
00:06:07,232 --> 00:06:09,368
AND FINALLY WE JUST
BUY BOTH DAMN COUCHES,

143
00:06:09,434 --> 00:06:11,737
AND PUT AN END TO IT.

144
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,238
YOU'D BUY
BOTH COUCHES?

145
00:06:13,305 --> 00:06:14,540
WELL, YOU GOTTA
COMPROMISE.

146
00:06:14,606 --> 00:06:17,142
(FRANTIC BELL RINGING)

147
00:06:19,444 --> 00:06:22,147
RIGHT HERE IS THE SECOND
BEST WAY TO SHOVEL SNOW.

148
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:24,483
YOU'VE SEEN THE DEAL.

149
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,552
OH,

150
00:06:26,618 --> 00:06:28,987
GOSH, I'VE LOST MY SHOVEL.

151
00:06:29,054 --> 00:06:30,856
BUT IF YOU'RE
MARRIED LIKE I AM,

152
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:33,992
YOU KNOW THE CHEESEY
EXCUSES ONLY WORK ONCE,

153
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:37,029
SO THIS WEEK ON
HANDYMAN CORNER.

154
00:06:37,095 --> 00:06:40,132
WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU A BETTER
WAY TO PLOUGH SNOW,

155
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,800
BY MAKING
A SNOWPLOUGH.

156
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:44,069
WE ARE GOING TO ACTUALLY USE
THIS DOOR AS OUR PLOUGH

157
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:48,240
BECAUSE SO FAR AT THE LODGE
WE'RE NOT USING IT AS A DOOR.

158
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:53,312
ALL RIGHTY, YOU SEE WE HAVE
A BIT OF A PROBLEM.

159
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:55,380
THE DOOR IS KIND OF SITTING
LOW ON THE GROUND THERE,

160
00:06:55,447 --> 00:06:57,783
SO WE NEED SOMETHING
FOR IT TO SLIDE ON.

161
00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:00,352
NOW, I COULD PUT
A TOBOGGAN UNDER THERE

162
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,020
OR MAYBE ONE OF
THOSE FLYING SAUCERS.

163
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:04,056
THEN I REMEMBERED THE
HANDYMAN CODE, HUH?

164
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:07,426
PUT SOMETHING YOU
DON'T USE TO GOOD USE.

165
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:10,295
SO I'M GOING TO USE THESE
CROSS-COUNTRY SKIS

166
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:13,532
THAT BERNICE GAVE ME FOR MY
BIRTHDAY AFTER THE CHECK-UP.

167
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:15,267
THEY ARE A LITTLE
BIT TOO LONG,

168
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:19,705
SO WHAT I WOULD DO IS JUST
TRIM THEM DOWN AND JUST
USE THE TIPS ON THOSE.

169
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:21,606
THAT WOULD PROBABLY
WORK PRETTY GOOD.

170
00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:25,444
IF YOU DON'T HAVE
A PAIR OF THESE,

171
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,680
YOU CAN PICK THEM UP REAL CHEAP
AT A GARAGE SALE ANY TIME
A FAT GUY HAS ONE.

172
00:07:31,216 --> 00:07:32,651
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S GOT IT.

173
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:35,087
BUT YOU KNOW ME, I LIKE TO BE
DOING TWO THINGS AT ONCE,

174
00:07:35,153 --> 00:07:37,489
THAT WAY I CAN MOVE SLOWER.

175
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:40,859
SO I CAN ALSO BE SALTING AND
SANDING WHILE I'M PLOUGHING.

176
00:07:40,926 --> 00:07:43,261
THAT WILL REALLY GET THE
NEIGHBOURS TALKING.

177
00:07:43,328 --> 00:07:46,998
SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS GET
YOURSELF A COUPLE OF SALT
SHAKERS FROM YOUR LOCAL
RESTAURANT.

178
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:50,302
YOU'RE THINKING TO YOURSELF, HOW
THE HECK AM I GOING TO GET SALT
SHAKERS FROM THE RESTAURANT?

179
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:51,736
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING...

180
00:07:51,803 --> 00:07:54,840
DEEP POCKETS HELP.

181
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:56,408
ALL RIGHT, TAKE THE SALT SHAKERS

182
00:07:56,475 --> 00:08:00,045
AND ATTACH THEM TO YOUR TIRES
WITH THE HANDYMAN SECRET WEAPON.

183
00:08:01,046 --> 00:08:02,881
THESE UNITS LOOK
PRETTY SHARP DON'T THEY?

184
00:08:02,948 --> 00:08:05,050
OF COURSE, THE KEY TO ANY
KIND OF A SNOWPLOUGH IS,

185
00:08:05,116 --> 00:08:07,152
YOU HAVE GOTTA HAVE SOME WEIGHT
IN THE BACK TO MAKE HER WORK.

186
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:12,324
SO I'M GOING TO THROW A FEW
YARDS OF SAND IN THE BACK
OF THE VAN THERE

187
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,626
NOT ONLY WILL IT
GIVE ME THE WEIGHT,

188
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:17,195
THE SAND WILL SIFT DOWN
THROUGH THE RUST HOLES
IN THE FLOOR THERE

189
00:08:17,262 --> 00:08:19,097
AND SAND THE ROAD.

190
00:08:19,164 --> 00:08:20,565
AND RUST THE ROAD.

191
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:23,268
ALL RIGHT.

192
00:08:24,803 --> 00:08:27,305
YOU KNOW, THAT FLOOR
DOESN'T LOOK TOO BAD.

193
00:08:27,372 --> 00:08:29,474
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO PUNCH
SOME HOLES IN THAT MYSELF.

194
00:08:31,276 --> 00:08:35,680
(GUNSHOTS)

195
00:08:43,255 --> 00:08:46,658
YOU MIGHT WANT TO WEAR
EAR PROTECTORS IF YOU --

196
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:49,160
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

197
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:50,829
DO YOU SMELL GAS?

198
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:52,430
EVERYBODY HEAR ME?

199
00:08:52,497 --> 00:08:53,865
AM I TALKING?

200
00:08:53,932 --> 00:08:56,001
HELLO.
HELLO.

201
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:58,336
OH, GEEZ, MY VOICE IS GONE.

202
00:09:00,872 --> 00:09:05,844
ALL RIGHT, NOW, YOU WANT A WAY
THAT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO BE
ABLE TO SEE YOU COMING,

203
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,179
SO I WENT DOWN TO ONE
OF THEM GARAGE SALES,

204
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:10,749
GOT MYSELF A COUPLE OF
TURNTABLES HERE.

205
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:14,185
AND THESE GO REAL FAST IF
YOU SET THEM ON 78 R.P.M.;

206
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:16,855
AT LEAST, THAT'S WHAT MY
GRANDFATHER TOLD ME.

207
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:18,123
SO REMEMBER...

208
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:19,724
IF THE WOMEN DON'T
FIND YOU HANDSOME,

209
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,659
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

210
00:09:24,863 --> 00:09:30,001
(ENGINE REVVING)

211
00:09:39,644 --> 00:09:42,747
LET ME TAKE A SECOND AND TALK TO
YOU OLDER FELLOWS ABOUT ANGER.

212
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:44,315
NOW, I DON'T MEAN
YOUR OWN ANGER

213
00:09:44,382 --> 00:09:46,751
BECAUSE THAT, OF COURSE,
IS PERFECTLY HEALTHY AND NATURAL

214
00:09:46,818 --> 00:09:49,721
AND REALLY NEEDS
TO BE EXPRESSED.

215
00:09:49,788 --> 00:09:52,524
OH, YEAH.
IF YOU DIDN'T
EXPRESS YOUR ANGER,

216
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:56,027
HOW WOULD THE REST OF
THE WORLD LEARN ANYTHING?

217
00:09:56,094 --> 00:10:00,064
NO, NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT
OTHER PEOPLE'S ANGER, YOU KNOW?

218
00:10:00,131 --> 00:10:02,500
NOW, THE FIRST QUESTION THAT
GOES THROUGH YOUR MIND IS,

219
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:04,135
WHAT CAN I DO TO
PLEASE THIS PERSON?

220
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:05,603
THE ANSWER, OF COURSE, IS...

221
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,205
NOTHING.

222
00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:10,074
NO, YOU ASSUME THAT BECAUSE
THEY'RE ANGRY AT YOU,

223
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:11,976
THEY'RE ANGRY AT YOU.

224
00:10:12,043 --> 00:10:15,413
OTHER PEOPLE AREN'T ANGRY
AT YOU OR WHAT YOU DO,
OR HOW YOU DO IT.

225
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,015
THEY'RE JUST ANGRY.

226
00:10:17,081 --> 00:10:20,184
YEAH, YOU HAPPEN TO BE HANDY
FOR THEM TO BE ANGRY AT.

227
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:21,986
SO DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

228
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:23,755
LET ME EXPLAIN IT
ANOTHER WAY.

229
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:25,623
MY WIFE BERNICE
IS ALWAYS CHILLY,

230
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,492
ALWAYS GOT THE
EXTRA SWEATER ON.

231
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:30,461
NOW, JUST BECAUSE SHE'S CHILLY
DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S CHILLY AT ME.

232
00:10:30,528 --> 00:10:33,698
SHE'S JUST CHILLY.

233
00:10:33,765 --> 00:10:38,303
SO SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST TALL;
SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST HAPPY;

234
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:40,972
SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST ANGRY.

235
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:43,775
AND THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH
ANGER IS THE POSSUM WAY...

236
00:10:43,841 --> 00:10:46,844
ROLL OVER AND PLAY DEAD.

237
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,913
OH, YEAH.

238
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,849
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

239
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,418
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

240
00:10:53,484 --> 00:10:55,520
IT'S VERY HARD TO BE ANGRY
AT A DEAD THING.

241
00:10:55,586 --> 00:10:57,522
JUST ASK MY WIFE.

242
00:10:57,588 --> 00:10:59,324
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

243
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,426
WE'RE ALL IN
THIS TOGETHER.

244
00:11:06,664 --> 00:11:09,867
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

245
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:13,204
HA HA HA.

246
00:11:15,173 --> 00:11:18,743
WELL, I HAD A BIT OF A SETBACK
AT OUR HOCKEY PRACTICE TODAY.

247
00:11:19,644 --> 00:11:22,780
THAT'S THE WORST TEAM
UNIFORM I'VE EVER SEEN.

248
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:25,183
WELL, WE USED TO HAVE THE
SPONSOR'S LOGO ON THERE,

249
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:27,385
BUT THEY FOUND IT WAS
HURTING THEIR BUSINESS,

250
00:11:27,452 --> 00:11:30,021
SO THEY RIPPED
THEM ALL OFF.

251
00:11:30,088 --> 00:11:32,790
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW,
EVERYBODY'S UNIFORM
LOOKS LIKE THIS.

252
00:11:32,857 --> 00:11:34,792
OH,

253
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:37,361
MATCHING SWEATERS.

254
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:43,434
LIKE I SAY, WE WERE AT
THE PRACTICE THERE,

255
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:44,969
AND BUSTER HADFIELD
IS IN GOAL,

256
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:47,905
AND MOOSE THOMPSON COMES
STREAKING DOWN THE
LEFT WING THERE,

257
00:11:47,972 --> 00:11:49,574
AND HE LETS
A SLAPPER GO.

258
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,075
HOLY MACKEREL!

259
00:11:51,142 --> 00:11:54,679
IT HITS BUSTER ABOUT FOUR
INCHES ABOVE THE FIVE HOLE.

260
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:56,581
WHOA, RIGHT --

261
00:11:56,647 --> 00:11:58,950
WHERE IS THAT?

262
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:01,953
YOU KNOW HOW BUSTER HAS
A FALSE SET OF TEETH?

263
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:05,890
WELL, NOW HE HAS
A FALSETTO VOICE.
(play on "false set of")

264
00:12:05,957 --> 00:12:08,893
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

265
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,361
DID HE HIT, LIKE,
A HIGH "C"?

266
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:13,164
MORE LIKE A
HIGH "F", HAROLD.

267
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:15,967
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

268
00:12:19,637 --> 00:12:23,107
ACTUALLY HE SAID
THE WHOLE WORD.

269
00:12:23,174 --> 00:12:25,776
BUT THE POINT IS WE'RE
LOOKING FOR A NEW GOALIE,

270
00:12:25,843 --> 00:12:27,311
AND I'LL TELL
YOU SOMETHING, HAROLD,

271
00:12:27,378 --> 00:12:29,347
YOU WERE OUR
UNANIMOUS CHOICE.

272
00:12:29,413 --> 00:12:31,248
ME?!

273
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:33,584
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

274
00:12:33,651 --> 00:12:35,252
THERE WE GO.

275
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:37,855
NO, NO, NO.

276
00:12:37,922 --> 00:12:39,323
COME ON, HAROLD.

277
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,825
YOU CAN WEAR AS MUCH
PADDING AS YOU WANT.

278
00:12:40,891 --> 00:12:42,526
NO, NO.
IT WON'T BE US
SHOOTING AT YOU, HAROLD,

279
00:12:42,593 --> 00:12:44,295
IT WILL BE
THE CURLERS.

280
00:12:44,362 --> 00:12:46,197
HAROLD.
HAROLD.
HAROLD.

281
00:12:46,263 --> 00:12:47,965
THERE'LL BE
GIRLS WATCHING.

282
00:12:48,032 --> 00:12:50,534
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

283
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:52,236
BUT YOU OWE
ME BIG TIME.

284
00:12:52,303 --> 00:12:53,304
OKAY.
GET YOUR COAT ON.

285
00:12:53,371 --> 00:12:54,839
LET'S GO.
LET'S GO.

286
00:12:54,905 --> 00:12:57,541
HOW COME BUSTER WASN'T WEARING
ANY PADDING, YOU KNOW,

287
00:12:57,608 --> 00:12:59,610
BETWEEN THE PIPES?

288
00:12:59,677 --> 00:13:03,614
WELL, NO POINT IN PROTECTING
A PART OF HIS ANATOMY
HE NEVER USES, EH?

289
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:10,354
I GUESS THAT'S WHY YOU
DON'T WEAR A HELMET, HUH?

290
00:13:10,421 --> 00:13:16,227
(APPLAUSE)

291
00:13:16,827 --> 00:13:18,896
AND NOW WELCOME TO THE
EXPERT PORTION OF THE SHOW,

292
00:13:18,963 --> 00:13:22,800
THAT PORTION OF THE SHOW WHERE
WE EXAMINE THOSE THREE LITTLE
WORDS THAT MEN FIND SO
HARD TO SAY...

293
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:25,603
Audience:
I DON'T KNOW.

294
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:27,071
IMAGINE IF THEY SAID THAT.

295
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:29,373
ANYWAY, JOINING MY UNCLE RED
ON THIS PART OF THE SHOW

296
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,576
IS HIS BEST FRIEND
Mr. MIKE HAMAR.

297
00:13:32,643 --> 00:13:34,178
WELCOME MIKE.

298
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:37,948
(APPLAUSE)

299
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:40,017
OKAY, THE LETTER
GOES AS FOLLOWS...

300
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:41,418
"DEAR EXPERTS,

301
00:13:41,485 --> 00:13:44,021
"I FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GET
MY HUSBAND AND TWO TEENAGERS

302
00:13:44,088 --> 00:13:45,856
"AWAY FROM THE
TELEVISION FOR SUPPER.

303
00:13:45,923 --> 00:13:48,692
"I WOULD BE OVERJOYED IF THEY
COULD JUST SKIP ONE HALF HOUR

304
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:53,164
"SO THEY COULD ALL SIT DOWN
AT THE TABLE AND TALK AND EAT
TOGETHER LIKE A REAL FAMILY.

305
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,698
"WHAT SHALL I DO?

306
00:13:54,765 --> 00:13:57,401
"WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE
LOST ART OF CONVERSATION?"

307
00:13:57,468 --> 00:13:59,837
WELL, I DON'T THINK ANY
CONVERSATION THAT WENT
ON AT MY HOUSE

308
00:13:59,904 --> 00:14:01,906
COULD BE CONSIDERED ART.

309
00:14:02,973 --> 00:14:05,476
IT'S MORE LIKE SPORT,

310
00:14:05,543 --> 00:14:08,045
CONTACT SPORT.

311
00:14:08,112 --> 00:14:09,647
THINGS GET A LITTLE
OUT OF HAND, DID THEY, MIKE?

312
00:14:09,713 --> 00:14:10,447
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

313
00:14:10,514 --> 00:14:11,882
A LOT OF HUBBUB.

314
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:13,951
MY UNCLE WOULD BE HIDING
UNDER THE COUCH,

315
00:14:14,018 --> 00:14:17,121
AND SOMEBODY WOULD
BE IN THE CORNER BLEEDING.

316
00:14:17,187 --> 00:14:20,958
MY DAD WAS ALWAYS IN A BAD MOOD
BECAUSE HE WAS BEING ARRESTED.

317
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:23,193
YOU KNOW,
THE USUAL STUFF.

318
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,762
YOU KNOW, I THINK THIS
PARTICULAR VIEWER

319
00:14:24,828 --> 00:14:27,398
JUST WANTS TO TURN THE T.V.
OFF AND HAVE A SIMPLE
DINNER CONVERSATION

320
00:14:27,464 --> 00:14:29,433
YOU KNOW, HAROLD, IT MAY
NOT BE THAT SIMPLE.

321
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,834
THIS IS A WOMAN,
SHE SAYS SHE'S
GOT A HUSBAND.

322
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:32,269
SHE'S GOT A COUPLE
OF TEENAGERS.

323
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:33,704
I'D SAY SHE'S BEEN MARRIED FOR
QUITE A WHILE NOW, YOU KNOW.

324
00:14:33,771 --> 00:14:35,339
WELL, NOT NECESSARILY.

325
00:14:35,406 --> 00:14:36,774
MY PARENTS HAD THEIR
8th ANNIVERSARY

326
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,444
WHEN MY YOUNGEST
BROTHER WAS 23.

327
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:43,347
OKAY, BUT THEY'VE BEEN LIVING
TOGETHER FOR A WHILE,

328
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:45,482
AND WHEN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
LIVING TOGETHER FOR
A LONG TIME,

329
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:48,152
SOMETIMES THEY DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO SAY TO EACH OTHER.

330
00:14:48,218 --> 00:14:50,387
OR YOU DO TRY TO SAY SOMETHING
CASUALLY AT DINNER

331
00:14:50,454 --> 00:14:55,059
AND, LIKE, THE NEXT THING
YOU KNOW, YOUR SISTER'S
BEING SUBPOENA'D.

332
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,429
I THINK THAT'S
THE WORD FOR IT.

333
00:14:58,495 --> 00:15:00,064
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

334
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,765
YOU KNOW --

335
00:15:01,832 --> 00:15:03,634
AND THERE'S ANOTHER DANGEROUS
SIDE TO THIS, HAROLD.

336
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,335
WHEN PEOPLE DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO SAY TO EACH OTHER,

337
00:15:05,402 --> 00:15:07,104
THEY END UP
CRITICIZING EACH OTHER.

338
00:15:07,171 --> 00:15:09,106
YEAH, YEAH, AND YOU DON'T WANT
THAT AT THE DINNER TABLE

339
00:15:09,173 --> 00:15:12,709
BECAUSE THESE FOLKS ARE
PACKING CUTLERY, RIGHT?

340
00:15:12,776 --> 00:15:14,812
YOU GET SOMEBODY WAVING
A STEAK KNIFE AROUND,

341
00:15:14,878 --> 00:15:19,249
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
YOU'VE GOT AN EXTRA EAR
ON THE CORN PLATTER.

342
00:15:19,316 --> 00:15:21,084
WELL, HERE'S MY ADVICE
TO THAT LADY.

343
00:15:21,151 --> 00:15:22,586
JUST TURN THE T.V. OFF

344
00:15:22,653 --> 00:15:25,322
'CAUSE THERE'S NO PROGRAM
AS GOOD AS TIME SPENT
WITH YOUR FAMILY.

345
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:29,326
EXCEPT FOR
"AMERICA'S MOST WANTED."

346
00:15:29,393 --> 00:15:34,131
THAT'S THE SAME AS SPENDING
TIME WITH MY FAMILY.

347
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:39,069
Red Green"
HERE'S SOMETHING
YOUNG PEOPLE DO.

348
00:15:39,136 --> 00:15:43,106
IT'S CALLED SNOWBOARDING.
WE'RE GONNA TRY IT.

349
00:15:43,173 --> 00:15:45,542
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
TOO MUCH FUN TO ME.

350
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:47,344
I DON'T KNOW --
NO THANKS BILL.

351
00:15:47,411 --> 00:15:48,979
DON'T NEED THE
ICE RIGHT NOW.

352
00:15:49,046 --> 00:15:50,447
SO THE IDEA IS YOU GO DOWN --

353
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:52,249
BILL, UH, THE BOARD...

354
00:15:52,316 --> 00:15:55,152
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
SOMEHOW ATTACHED TO THAT?

355
00:15:55,219 --> 00:15:58,522
I DON'T KNOW, I'VE NEVER
DONE IT, BUT IS THIS RIGHT?

356
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:01,391
DOES THIS SEEM RIGHT TO YOU?

357
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,894
DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT TO ME.

358
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:06,196
WHAT?
OH, OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

359
00:16:06,263 --> 00:16:07,864
GOT TWO MORE BOARDS.

360
00:16:07,931 --> 00:16:10,000
ALL RIGHT, BILL, I THINK
I UNDERSTAND THE THEORY.

361
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:11,568
WE'RE NOT DOING
THIS AGAIN, ARE WE?

362
00:16:11,635 --> 00:16:13,036
THERE WE GO.
THERE WE GO.

363
00:16:13,103 --> 00:16:14,404
OH, THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT.

364
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:16,707
OH, I SEE, SO I'LL
NEED TWO BOARDS.

365
00:16:16,773 --> 00:16:19,409
IT LOOKS AWKWARD TO ME.
IS THAT ALL RIGHT?
IS THAT ALL RIGHT?

366
00:16:19,476 --> 00:16:22,879
YEAH, I GUESS THAT'S
THE RIGHT WAY.

367
00:16:22,946 --> 00:16:26,049
WATCH OUT FOR
THE VAN, BILL.

368
00:16:26,116 --> 00:16:28,485
OH, NO, HE'S GOT IT.

369
00:16:31,221 --> 00:16:32,356
FENCE!

370
00:16:32,422 --> 00:16:33,457
OH, YOU GOT IT.

371
00:16:33,523 --> 00:16:35,125
THERE.
STOP.

372
00:16:35,192 --> 00:16:37,260
OH, OH, YOU DON'T EVEN
NEED A SNOWBOARD.

373
00:16:37,327 --> 00:16:39,363
JUST USE A 4x8
SHEET OF PLYWOOD.

374
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:42,065
JUST LIKE BILL:
GOOD ONE SIDE.

375
00:16:42,132 --> 00:16:43,567
SHE DUG IN.
SHE DUG IN.

376
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:45,402
SHE'S GOING OVER, BILL.
SHE'S GOING OVER.

377
00:16:45,469 --> 00:16:48,372
NO, NO, I'LL HELP HIM.
OKAY, I'LL HELP HIM.

378
00:16:48,438 --> 00:16:49,706
YEAH, I'LL HELP HIM.

379
00:16:49,773 --> 00:16:52,376
OH, LOOK, STILL GOT A PULSE.

380
00:16:52,442 --> 00:16:55,879
GET THAT BOARD OFF HIM THERE,
AND HE'S PROBABLY ALL RIGHT.

381
00:16:55,946 --> 00:16:56,913
BILL, ARE YOU OKAY?

382
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,050
BILL?
BILL?
BILL?

383
00:17:00,117 --> 00:17:01,618
GREAT.

384
00:17:01,685 --> 00:17:03,620
I HOPE HIS FACE
IS AT THIS END.

385
00:17:06,123 --> 00:17:10,694
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

386
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:12,262
HAROLD, YOU COMING?

387
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:14,664
Harold:
YEAH, I'LL BE
RIGHT THERE.

388
00:17:14,731 --> 00:17:18,969
WELL, THE BIG HOCKEY GAME TO
FIND OUT WHETHER POSSUM LAKE
IS FOR CURLING OR FOR HOCKEY

389
00:17:19,035 --> 00:17:20,971
TAKES PLACE IN
ABOUT AN HOUR.

390
00:17:21,037 --> 00:17:25,008
THE REST OF THE GUYS ARE ALREADY
UP THERE HAVING A COUPLE OF
BRACERS FOR WARMTH.

391
00:17:25,075 --> 00:17:28,979
SOMETIMES THEY GET SO WARM
THEY CAN HARDLY MOVE.

392
00:17:32,983 --> 00:17:39,923
(APPLAUSE)

393
00:17:41,424 --> 00:17:42,492
HOW DO I LOOK?

394
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,861
WOW, HAROLD!

395
00:17:44,928 --> 00:17:46,463
THAT BUBBLE WRAP?

396
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,865
YOU KNOW IT.

397
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:51,902
IF YOU GET INJURED WHERE
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE SHIPPED?

398
00:17:51,968 --> 00:17:53,470
I DON'T PLAN ON
GETTING INJURED.

399
00:17:53,536 --> 00:17:55,038
NO, I THINK YOU'RE GOING
TO BE OKAY, HAROLD.

400
00:17:55,105 --> 00:17:56,873
I SEE YOU'VE GOT
THE MAJOR ITEMS --

401
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,910
OH, THE FRY PAN'S
A NICE TOUCH.

402
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:02,345
HOW DO YOU WANT 'EM?
SUNNY-SIDE UP?

403
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:06,950
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

404
00:18:07,017 --> 00:18:10,387
ANYWAY BUT SCRAMBLED
IS OKAY BY ME.

405
00:18:10,453 --> 00:18:12,789
YOU KNOW, HAROLD, JUST A
LITTLE WORD OF ADVICE.

406
00:18:12,856 --> 00:18:15,759
YOU MAY WANT TO FLIP THAT
FACE MASK DOWN ONCE THE
HOCKEY GAME GETS STARTED.

407
00:18:15,825 --> 00:18:17,360
OH, YEAH.
OH, YEAH.
OH, YEAH.

408
00:18:21,598 --> 00:18:25,268
OH, MAN.

409
00:18:25,335 --> 00:18:27,704
BOY, IF THERE WAS EVER ANYTHING
SCREAMING FOR A SLAP SHOT,

410
00:18:27,771 --> 00:18:29,439
THAT'S GOTTA BE IT.

411
00:18:29,506 --> 00:18:31,641
COME ON, HAROLD.

412
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:35,178
THIS IS THE REPAIR PART
OF THE SHOW WE CALL,

413
00:18:35,245 --> 00:18:38,481
"IF IT AIN'T BROKE,
YOU'RE NOT TRYIN'."

414
00:18:38,548 --> 00:18:42,519
WE'VE GOT OUR WATER TAXI
CAPTAIN, HAP SHAUGNESSY HERE.

415
00:18:42,585 --> 00:18:43,953
HOW YOU DOIN' HAP?

416
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,622
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
FOR US TODAY?

417
00:18:45,688 --> 00:18:47,957
I'VE GOT A FIREPLACE
GRATE HERE, RED.

418
00:18:48,024 --> 00:18:49,392
OH, BOY, THERE'S BEEN
SOME WEIGHT ON THERE.

419
00:18:49,459 --> 00:18:51,895
YOU MAY BE NOT DRYING YOUR
FIREWOOD ENOUGH THERE.

420
00:18:51,961 --> 00:18:53,329
WELL, IT'S SOLID STEEL.

421
00:18:53,396 --> 00:18:54,697
LOOK AT IT.

422
00:18:54,764 --> 00:18:56,466
THEY DON'T MAKE STEEL
LIKE THEY USED TO.

423
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:59,102
NO, BUT THE BEAUTY HERE IS YOU
PUT A LITTLE HEAT ON THAT,

424
00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:00,804
AND WE CAN BEND
THAT RIGHT BACK.

425
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,172
WHAT HAPPENED ANYWAY?

426
00:19:02,238 --> 00:19:05,341
YOUR SISTER FALL INTO
THE FIREPLACE AGAIN?

427
00:19:05,408 --> 00:19:08,478
NO, NO, NO, A BURGLAR
STEPPED ON IT.

428
00:19:08,545 --> 00:19:11,614
WELL, THAT'S GOTTA BE SOME
FAT BURGLAR, I TELL YOU.

429
00:19:11,681 --> 00:19:13,082
YEAH, NO KIDDING.

430
00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:14,984
BROKE INTO MY HOUSE
OVER THE HOLIDAYS.

431
00:19:15,051 --> 00:19:18,254
MUST HAVE SLID
DOWN THE CHIMNEY.

432
00:19:18,321 --> 00:19:20,123
KIDS TODAY, EH?

433
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,791
CAN'T THROW THE ROCK THROUGH
THE WINDOW OR ANYTHING.

434
00:19:21,858 --> 00:19:23,960
GOT TO GO THEIR
OWN WAY ON IT.

435
00:19:24,027 --> 00:19:25,562
DID THEY TAKE ANYTHING?

436
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:26,896
NOTHING.

437
00:19:26,963 --> 00:19:30,967
JUST ATE SOME
COOKIES AND MILK,

438
00:19:31,034 --> 00:19:35,171
AND LEFT US
SOME PACKAGES.

439
00:19:35,238 --> 00:19:38,575
OKAY, SO YOU'RE SAYIN' SOMEBODY
CAME DOWN YOUR CHIMNEY
DURING THE HOLIDAYS,

440
00:19:38,641 --> 00:19:41,578
ATE COOKIES AND MILK
AND LEFT YOU SOME PRESENTS?

441
00:19:41,644 --> 00:19:44,914
WAS HE WEARING RED WITH
WHITE TRIM ON IT, HAP?

442
00:19:44,981 --> 00:19:47,483
DIDN'T SEE HIM, RED.

443
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:51,588
THE WIFE AND I HAD SETTLED IN
FOR A LONG WINTER'S NAP.

444
00:19:51,654 --> 00:19:57,260
(APPLAUSE)

445
00:19:57,327 --> 00:20:00,530
I HEARD A CLATTER ARISE,
BUT I DIDN'T GET UP TO LOOK.

446
00:20:00,597 --> 00:20:01,864
I SUPPOSE I SHOULD HAVE
OPENED THE WINDOW AND

447
00:20:01,931 --> 00:20:03,766
Both:
THROWN UP THE SASH.

448
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:07,270
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

449
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:13,509
SO, OKAY, SO YOU'RE SAYING
SANTA CAME TO YOUR HOUSE
OVER THE HOLIDAYS.

450
00:20:13,576 --> 00:20:14,844
SANTA?

451
00:20:14,911 --> 00:20:17,780
YEAH, SANTA, YEAH!

452
00:20:17,847 --> 00:20:21,050
NEVER THOUGHT
OF THAT,

453
00:20:23,219 --> 00:20:24,854
BUT YOU COULD
BE RIGHT.

454
00:20:24,921 --> 00:20:27,123
IF PEOPLE FIND OUT SANTA IS
REAL AND HE CAME TO MY HOUSE,

455
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,792
I BET PEOPLE WOULD
PROBABLY PAY TO SEE THAT.

456
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:33,196
RED, RED, FORGET ABOUT
STRAIGHTENING THAT.

457
00:20:33,262 --> 00:20:35,064
I NEED THAT BENT
JUST THE WAY IT IS.

458
00:20:35,131 --> 00:20:36,766
THAT'S MY PROOF.

459
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,535
ALL RIGHT, YOU TELL THE STORY
EXACTLY THE WAY YOU TOLD ME.

460
00:20:39,602 --> 00:20:41,704
THAT WILL BE MY PROOF.

461
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:45,441
(APPLAUSE)

462
00:20:53,716 --> 00:20:57,053
NOW, I TELL YOU THAT HAS
TO BE THE LOW POINT,

463
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,090
GETTING BEAT AT OUR NATIONAL
GAME BY A BUNCH OF CURLERS.

464
00:21:01,157 --> 00:21:04,160
37-NOTHING.

465
00:21:04,227 --> 00:21:06,095
NICE GOAL TENDING, HAROLD.

466
00:21:06,162 --> 00:21:08,364
(MUMBLING)

467
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:13,803
I MADE SOME STOPS.

468
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,338
THAT WAS ONE OUT
OF YOUR MOUTH.

469
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:17,807
TWO, THREE, FOUR,
FIVE, SIX,

470
00:21:17,874 --> 00:21:20,977
SEVEN, EIGHT.

471
00:21:21,043 --> 00:21:22,345
NINE.

472
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:24,313
OH, YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

473
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,115
BUT HAROLD,
YOU LET IN 37 GOALS.

474
00:21:26,182 --> 00:21:27,450
HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?

475
00:21:27,516 --> 00:21:29,318
WELL, THEY WERE
CURLING THEM AT ME.

476
00:21:29,385 --> 00:21:34,156
YOU KNOW,
"SWEEP! SWEEP!"

477
00:21:34,223 --> 00:21:35,925
THAT'S SCARY
WHEN THEY DO THAT.

478
00:21:35,992 --> 00:21:37,426
I GOT NERVOUS.

479
00:21:37,493 --> 00:21:40,062
IT WOULD HAVE HELPED IF
I HAD HAD A LITTLE
OFFENCE, YOU KNOW.

480
00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:41,897
MAYBE IF YOU GOT
JUST ONE GOAL.

481
00:21:41,964 --> 00:21:44,066
EVEN IF YOU GOT
ONE SHOT ON GOAL.

482
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:46,802
WELL, HAROLD, THEY MADE THE
RINK THE SAME SIZE AS
THEY DO FOR CURLING.

483
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:49,772
YOU KNOW WE CAN'T
SKATE THAT FAR.

484
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:51,941
(POSSUM CALL)

485
00:21:52,008 --> 00:21:53,309
MEETING TIME,
UNCLE RED.

486
00:21:53,376 --> 00:21:54,910
YEAH, YOU GO
AHEAD, GUMP.

487
00:21:54,977 --> 00:21:57,079
I'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.

488
00:21:58,814 --> 00:22:01,751
TAKE IT EASY.
TAKE IT EASY.

489
00:22:05,821 --> 00:22:08,824
SO IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT
HOME AFTER THE MEETING.

490
00:22:08,891 --> 00:22:10,493
I HOPE YOU'RE IN
A ROMANTIC MOOD,

491
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,396
I'VE ALREADY SUFFERED
ONE SHUTOUT TODAY.

492
00:22:13,462 --> 00:22:15,364
TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

493
00:22:15,431 --> 00:22:18,501
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND HAROLD
AND ALL THE GANG UP HERE
AT POSSUM LODGE,

494
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:20,169
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

495
00:22:20,236 --> 00:22:25,474
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

496
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:31,714
[CAPTIONS PERFORMED BY
CAPTION RESOURCE CENTER]

497
00:22:31,781 --> 00:22:33,149
Harold:
HERE HE COMES!

498
00:22:33,215 --> 00:22:35,184
SIT DOWN!
HE LIKES IT WHEN
EVERYBODY SITS.

499
00:22:35,251 --> 00:22:37,253
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

500
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:40,256
OKAY, ALL RISE.

501
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:45,428
Everyone:
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI.

502
00:22:45,494 --> 00:22:47,329
Red:
SIT DOWN.

503
00:22:47,396 --> 00:22:48,731
Harold:
OKAY, WE'VE JUST GOT
ONE QUICK ANNOUNCEMENT.

504
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:51,500
THERE'S GONNA BE A MEETING
OF MEN AGAINST MALLS,

505
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:53,536
MAM, AS THEY LIKE
TO BE KNOWN AS.

506
00:22:53,602 --> 00:22:56,872
THEY ARE GOING TO BE FILING A
GRIEVANCE AGAINST BACHELORS
AGAINST MARRIAGE,

507
00:22:56,939 --> 00:23:00,009
OR BAM, AS THEY LIKE
TO BE KNOWN.

508
00:23:00,075 --> 00:23:00,876
Red:
SOUNDS LIKE IT'S
GOING TO BE

509
00:23:00,943 --> 00:23:04,914
SLAM, BAM, THANK YOU, MAM
