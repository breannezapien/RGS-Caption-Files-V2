00:12:52,536 --> 00:12:54,939
DON'T YELL FORE NOW,
YOU'RE WAY TOO LATE.

300
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:56,874
TAKE THAT BALL AND -- WHAT?

301
00:12:56,874 --> 00:13:00,044
OH, A LITTLE CONTEST,
A DRIVING CONTEST,

302
00:13:00,044 --> 00:13:01,445
SEE WHO CAN HIT THE
BALL THE FARTHEST.

303
00:13:01,445 --> 00:13:02,947
WELL, LET'S MAKE IT
INTERESTING, BILL.

304
00:13:02,947 --> 00:13:06,217
LET'S PUT SOME MONEY ON THIS.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

305
00:13:06,217 --> 00:13:10,354
GET YOUR WALLET OUT.
THAT'S YOUR WALLET?

306
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:12,523
OH MY GOSH.

307
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:17,495
ALL RIGHT.
SO I'LL GO FIRST.

308
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:19,130
I FEEL PRETTY
GOOD ABOUT THIS.

309
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,298
JUST REAR BACK
AND LET 'ER RIP.

310
00:13:21,298 --> 00:13:23,334
I DIDN'T GET ALL OF IT.
I DIDN'T GET ALL OF IT.

311
00:13:23,334 --> 00:13:25,035
NO. NO. NO.

312
00:13:25,035 --> 00:13:26,504
IT'S NOT BAD,
THOUGH, I GUESS.

313
00:13:26,504 --> 00:13:28,205
ALL RIGHT, SO I GO UP
TO THE LITTLE FLAG

314
00:13:28,205 --> 00:13:29,874
AND I STICK THE FLAG
IN WHERE MY BALL IS.

315
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:31,809
AND NOW BILL HAS TO HIT HIS
BALL EITHER FARTHER

316
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:34,912
OR THE SAME DISTANCE
OR NOT AS FAR.

317
00:13:34,912 --> 00:13:36,747
[ FARTING SOUND ]

318
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:38,082
THAT WAS THE FLAG.

319
00:13:38,082 --> 00:13:40,618
I'M GUESSING NOT AS FAR.

320
00:13:40,618 --> 00:13:42,553
OH, LOOK OUT, BILL.

321
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:45,923
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

322
00:13:45,923 --> 00:13:48,759
NOT BAD. NOT BAD.
NICE TRY, BILL.

323
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:50,060
I WILL JUST GRAB MYSELF --

324
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,696
WHAT? WHAT?
I WON -- WHAT?

325
00:13:52,696 --> 00:13:56,967
THAT WAS A PRACTICE SWING?
WHAT THE HECK IS THIS NOW?

326
00:13:56,967 --> 00:14:00,471
OH, NO, BILL IS TRYING TO GET
THE PENDULUM THEORY WORKING

327
00:14:00,471 --> 00:14:02,006
WITH THE BIGGER,
LONGER CLUB.

328
00:14:02,006 --> 00:14:03,173
YOU MISSED IT.
YOU MISSED IT.

329
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:05,142
OH, NO.
OH, NO.

330
00:14:05,142 --> 00:14:07,378
NICE TRY BUT NOT ENOUGH.

331
00:14:07,378 --> 00:14:09,613
EVEN THAT LONGER
PENDULUM DIDN'T -- WHAT?

332
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:12,850
NO, BILL, YOU'VE ALREADY
HAD TWO SHOTS, WHAT'S GOING --

333
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,485
HE ASKED ME TO HELP HIM
PUT THIS LADDER UP HERE.

334
00:14:14,485 --> 00:14:15,953
HE'S GOT
SOMETHING IN MIND.

335
00:14:15,953 --> 00:14:17,755
I DON'T THINK HE
HAS A CHANCE THOUGH.

336
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:19,757
SO WHAT THE HECK?
WHAT'S HE GOT NOW?

337
00:14:19,757 --> 00:14:21,492
OH MY GOSH.

338
00:14:21,492 --> 00:14:24,328
YOU WANT TO SEE THE
GOLF BAG THAT CAME OUT OF.

339
00:14:24,328 --> 00:14:26,630
AND UP HE
GOES UP THE LADDER

340
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,999
AND I'M KIND OF INTERESTED TO
SEE HOW THIS TURNS OUT
AT THIS POINT.

341
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:32,770
HE SWINGS HIS LEG OVER,
ASKS FOR THE CLUB.

342
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:37,141
THAT'S PROBABLY
AN 18-FOOTER NOW.

343
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:38,575
AND I GUESS
THAT'S THE DRIVER.

344
00:14:38,575 --> 00:14:41,178
YOU DON'T HAVE SOMETHING
THAT LONG AND MAKE IT
A THREE WOOD.

345
00:14:41,178 --> 00:14:42,579
CAN YOU SWING THAT, BILL?

346
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:44,615
THAT LOOKS KIND OF
HARD TO CONTROL.

347
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:46,684
WATCH YOUR AIM.
WATCH YOUR AIM, BILL.

348
00:14:46,684 --> 00:14:47,818
TEE UP. TEE UP.

349
00:14:47,818 --> 00:14:49,753
OH, HE HIT THE LADDER,
HIT THE LADDER.

350
00:14:49,753 --> 00:14:51,922
OH, OH, THE HYDRO POLE!

351
00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:54,058
AND THE PENDULUM!
HERE COMES THE PENDULUM!

352
00:14:54,058 --> 00:14:56,293
OH MY GOSH HE WON.

353
00:14:58,362 --> 00:15:00,564
OH MY GOSH.

354
00:15:00,564 --> 00:15:02,299
BE A GOOD WINNER NOW, BILL.

355
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:04,701
HERE'S YOUR MONEY.

356
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:07,504
THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUY
THE FINEST MEDICAL TREATMENT

357
00:15:07,504 --> 00:15:10,007
MONEY CAN BUY.

358
00:15:13,143 --> 00:15:15,245
BILL SEEMS SHORTER.

359
00:15:17,614 --> 00:15:20,284
STAY TUNED AS DALTON GOES
TO THE EDGE OF BANKRUPTCY,

360
00:15:20,284 --> 00:15:21,585
SHORT TRIP,

361
00:15:21,585 --> 00:15:24,021
AND WINSTON TELLS US HOW
TO DO PUBLIC SPEAKING.

362
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,525
"PUTTING IN THE DOCK,"
BY ME.

363
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:30,828
"WE GATHER BY THE
WATER'S EDGE,

364
00:15:30,828 --> 00:15:32,896
"AND EVERYONE GRABS A SIDE,

365
00:15:32,896 --> 00:15:35,399
"WE LIFT THE DOCK UP
ON OUR BACKS

366
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,668
AND BRACE OUR
LEGS FOR THE RIDE.

367
00:15:37,668 --> 00:15:39,603
"WE DASH DOWN TO
THE ROCKY SHORE

368
00:15:39,603 --> 00:15:42,105
"AND THROW THE DOCK
IN END OVER END.

369
00:15:42,105 --> 00:15:44,274
"IT'S AN AWFUL
WAY TO TREAT A DOCTOR,

370
00:15:44,274 --> 00:15:47,311
"BUT WITH MEDICATION,
DOC WILL MEND.

371
00:15:47,311 --> 00:15:49,913
"PHYSICIAN HEAL THYSELF."

372
00:15:51,915 --> 00:15:53,717
WELL, WE WENT
OVER TO THE CLUB.

373
00:15:53,717 --> 00:15:55,319
WE PICKED UP ALL
THE GOLF EQUIPMENT

374
00:15:55,319 --> 00:15:57,321
AND ALL THE SKI EQUIPMENT
THAT MOOSE HAD WON,

375
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:58,956
AND WE BROUGHT 'ER
ALL BACK TO THE LODGE.

376
00:15:58,956 --> 00:16:00,424
WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO WITH IT NEXT.

377
00:16:00,424 --> 00:16:04,761
WELL, YOU'VE ALREADY
DRAGGED IT 5 MILES,

378
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:06,163
OH, NO, HAROLD,
OUR PROBLEM IS

379
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:07,397
WE GOT TOO MANY
GOOD IDEAS.

380
00:16:07,397 --> 00:16:09,333
LIKE, WE WERE THINKING MAYBE
TAKE THE CHAIR LIFT,

381
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,568
HOOK 'ER UP, AND WE'LL RIDE
THE GUYS FROM POSSUM LODGE

382
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:13,937
ALL THE WAY DOWN INTO LAKE
POSSUM AND BACK UP AGAIN,

383
00:16:13,937 --> 00:16:16,173
YOU KNOW, AND ON BATH NIGHT
WE'LL DO TWO CYCLES,

384
00:16:16,173 --> 00:16:17,341
WASH AND RINSE.

385
00:16:17,341 --> 00:16:18,942
THAT'S DUMB.
YOU GUYS ARE DUMB.

386
00:16:18,942 --> 00:16:22,379
WHAT STUPID THING YOU GOING
TO DO NEXT WITH THE STUPID
SNOW MAKING MACHINE?

387
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:24,014
OH, THIS IS GREAT,
HAROLD,

388
00:16:24,014 --> 00:16:26,817
SIX-FOOT-WIDE
SNOW CONES.

389
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:30,087
WHO'S GOING TO EAT A
SIX-FOOT-WIDE SNOW CONE?

390
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:32,823
SOMEBODY WITH A REALLY
BIG MOUTH, HAROLD.

391
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:37,294
WELL, WHAT IF THIS PERSON

392
00:16:37,294 --> 00:16:38,962
DOESN'T WANNA TO EAT A
SIX-FOOT-WIDE SNOW CONE?

393
00:16:38,962 --> 00:16:41,031
WE'LL DROP IT IN
HIS PANTS.

394
00:16:45,502 --> 00:16:47,237
Glen: THIS BOAT'S FOR SALE.

395
00:16:47,237 --> 00:16:48,705
IT'S ONLY 100 BUCKS,

396
00:16:48,705 --> 00:16:52,142
BUT YOU SHOULD BE
A STRONG SWIMMER.

397
00:16:52,142 --> 00:16:54,745
WE'RE OUT HERE BY THE MAIN
HIGHWAY AT HUMPHRIES'
EVERYTHING STORE

398
00:16:54,745 --> 00:16:57,280
TO DO A LITTLE BUSINESS
TRANSACTION WITH THE OWNER,

399
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,816
NOW, DALTON, WE WERE CLEANING
OUT MOOSE'S SKI AND GOLF
CLUB THERE,

400
00:16:59,816 --> 00:17:01,618
AND WE COME UP WITH THIS
LITTLE UNIT RIGHT HERE.

401
00:17:01,618 --> 00:17:03,420
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IS WORTH?

402
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,722
WELL, YOU KNOW, BEFORE
MOOSE THOMPSON BOUGHT
THAT RESORT,

403
00:17:05,722 --> 00:17:07,924
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
WORTH A PRETTY PENNY.

404
00:17:07,924 --> 00:17:10,093
NOW IT'S NEXT
TO USELESS.

405
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:12,395
OH COME ON, NOW,
DALTON, YOU GOT TO
BE PULLING MY LEG.

406
00:17:12,395 --> 00:17:15,499
I MEAN, THIS WAS USED
BY THE PIONEERS FOR --

407
00:17:15,499 --> 00:17:17,000
WELL, FOR SOMETHING,
I WOULD THINK.

408
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,303
RED, THE ANTIQUE BUSINESS
IS BUILT ON TWO CORNERSTONES,

409
00:17:20,303 --> 00:17:21,671
GOLFER AND SKIERS.

410
00:17:21,671 --> 00:17:23,206
WITHOUT THEM, I'D BE
BANKRUPT IN A WEEK.

411
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:24,674
WHY?

412
00:17:24,674 --> 00:17:26,610
WELL, THE MEN
GOLF TOGETHER

413
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,278
AND THEN THE WOMEN
DROP THEM OFF

414
00:17:28,278 --> 00:17:31,214
AND THEN THEY DRIVE AROUND
KILLING TIME DOING
GUESS WHAT?

415
00:17:31,214 --> 00:17:33,517
LOOKING FOR ANTIQUES?
BINGO!

416
00:17:33,517 --> 00:17:35,886
AND SKIERS, WHAT'S THE
NUMBER ONE SOUVENIR
THEY TAKE HOME?

417
00:17:35,886 --> 00:17:38,688
BROKEN LEGS?
ANTIQUES.

418
00:17:38,688 --> 00:17:40,390
THEY BUY THEM
BY THE TRUCK LOAD.

419
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,526
IT'S MUST ALL THAT COLD
WIND IN THEIR FACE,

420
00:17:42,526 --> 00:17:44,060
MAKES THEM IRRATIONAL.

421
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,363
WITH THE GOLF
AND SKI CLUB CLOSED,

422
00:17:46,363 --> 00:17:50,700
THEY WON'T BE BACK,
AND I'M STUCK WITH THIS.

423
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,636
WELL, NOW, DON'T
GO CRAZY HERE, DALTON.

424
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:54,537
WE'LL GET SKIERS UP
IN THE WINTER.

425
00:17:54,537 --> 00:17:56,172
WE'LL GET
CROSS-COUNTRY SKIERS.

426
00:17:56,172 --> 00:17:57,874
CROSS-COUNTRY
SKIERS, HAH!

427
00:17:57,874 --> 00:17:59,476
YOU KNOW WHY THEY'RE
CROSS-COUNTRY
SKIING, RED?

428
00:17:59,476 --> 00:18:01,845
THEY'RE TOO CHEAP
TO BUY LIFT TICKETS.

429
00:18:01,845 --> 00:18:03,546
SKINNY BANDY-LEGGED
VEGETARIANS,

430
00:18:03,546 --> 00:18:05,882
SHUFFLING THEIR WAY
FOR FREE ACROSS THE SNOW.

431
00:18:05,882 --> 00:18:08,618
CROSS-COUNTRY SKIERS
ARE TIGHT WADS!

432
00:18:08,618 --> 00:18:10,487
WELL, HOW ABOUT
ICE FISHERMAN?

433
00:18:10,487 --> 00:18:12,088
THEY COME UP
TO POSSUM LAKE,

434
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:13,323
HUNDREDS OF 'EM.

435
00:18:13,323 --> 00:18:15,091
I TELL YOU,
THEY SPEND MONEY.

436
00:18:15,091 --> 00:18:17,027
OH, YOU'VE BEEN INSIDE
A LOT OF ICE HUTS,
HAVE YOU, RED?

437
00:18:17,027 --> 00:18:18,161
YEAH.
YEAH?

438
00:18:18,161 --> 00:18:20,597
SEEN A LOT OF ANTIQUES
THERE, HAVE YOU, HUH?

439
00:18:20,597 --> 00:18:22,399
ICE FISHERMEN SITTING
AROUND THE HOLE,

440
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:24,200
JIGGLING THEIR
LINE SAYING,

441
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,935
OH, BOY, WHEN I
CATCH A TROUT

442
00:18:25,935 --> 00:18:28,405
I'M GOING TO GO DOWN
AND  BUY MYSELF A
NICE SPINDLE BED

443
00:18:28,405 --> 00:18:30,040
WITH A BRASS
HEADBOARD, HUH?

444
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,975
WON'T THAT BE
A NICE ACCENT PIECE

445
00:18:31,975 --> 00:18:33,743
FOR THE WALL WHERE
I STORE THE BEER CASES?

446
00:18:33,743 --> 00:18:35,812
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

447
00:18:35,812 --> 00:18:37,280
IT'S NO USE,

448
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,848
I'M GETTING OUT OF
THE ANTIQUE BUSINESS.

449
00:18:38,848 --> 00:18:40,517
I'M GOING TO TRY TO
MAKE A GO OF IT

SCRAP BUSINESS.

451
00:18:41,951 --> 00:18:44,120
WELL, HOW ARE YOU
GOING TO DO THAT?

452
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,856
I'M GOING TO CHANGE
THE SIGN ON MY STORE.

453
00:18:46,856 --> 00:18:48,792
THAT WILL DO IT.

THE FIRST LETTER
GOES AS FOLLOWS...

458
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:01,004
"DEAR EXPERTS,

459
00:19:01,004 --> 00:19:03,840
"I HAVE TO GIVE A SPEECH
AT OUR NEXT GENERAL MEETING,

460
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,842
AND I'M VERY NERVOUS ABOUT
TALKING TO A GROUP
OF PEOPLE.

461

"CAN YOU HELP ME?"

00:19:07,977 --> 00:19:10,547
WELL, I ALWAYS FIND
EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL
CONSUMPTION

463
00:19:10,547 --> 00:19:12,582
REALLY LOOSENS --

464
00:19:12,582 --> 00:19:15,018
UNCLE RED, I DON'T
THINK THAT BEING DRUNK

465
00:19:15,018 --> 00:19:17,220
IS GOING TO HELP
THIS LADY'S SPEECH.

466
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,656
I MEANT THE
AUDIENCE, HAROLD.

467
00:19:19,656 --> 00:19:21,558
YOU GET THEM SO JUICED UP
THEY CAN'T HEAR YOU,

468
00:19:21,558 --> 00:19:24,060
IT REALLY TAKES
THE PRESSURE OFF.

469
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,729
LOW IS SELF-ESTEEM,
THERE'S YOUR PROBLEM, EH?

470
00:19:26,729 --> 00:19:28,231
OH, YEAH,
I'VE BEEN THERE.

YOU KNOW, BEFORE
THE SEPTIC BUSINESS

472
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:33,503
I WOULDN'T EVEN
HOLD MY HEAD UP.

473
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:37,140
AND NOW YOU HAVE TO,
I WOULD THINK.

474
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,843
WELL, ANYWAY, I LEARNED
THE THREE JUMP STARTS

475
00:19:40,843 --> 00:19:43,513
OF SELF-POWER
AND BIGGER LUNGS

DO THAT, ANY IDIOT CAN,"

478
00:19:48,551 --> 00:19:50,687
OH MAN, YOU DIDN'T TAKE
ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE

479
00:19:50,687 --> 00:19:52,722
SELF-ISH HELP COURSE
THINGS, DID YOU?

480
00:19:52,722 --> 00:19:54,123
WELL, I WASN'T GOING
TO AT FIRST,

481
00:19:54,123 --> 00:19:55,858
BUT I WORKED UP THE COURAGE
AFTER WATCHING

482
00:19:55,858 --> 00:20:01,097
"SEIZE THE SELF-HELP COURSE OF
THE DAY" BY WALTER MOLLUSK.

SO, WINSTON, WHAT ARE THE
THREE JUMP START POINTS

00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:06,135
FOR BIGGER LUNGS THING,
YOU KNOW,

00:20:06,135 --> 00:20:08,771
WITHOUT, YOU KNOW,
PUMPING SEWAGE?

486
00:20:08,771 --> 00:20:12,342
WELL, NUMBER ONE,
DOMINATE YOUR AUDIENCE.

487
00:20:12,342 --> 00:20:14,911
I LIKE TO DO IT
FROM A 15-FOOT STEP LADDER

488
00:20:14,911 --> 00:20:17,580
AND JUST SORT OF
TALK DOWN TO 'EM, EH?

489
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:21,184
WELL, MA'AM, FOR THIS
SPEECH YOU MIGHT WANT
TO WEAR SLACKS.

YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
THERE'S REALLY NOTHING

491
00:20:26,589 --> 00:20:28,624
LIKE SEEING AN AUDIENCE
LIKE THIS, EH?

NUMBER TWO, HAVE A LITTLE
DYNAMICS TO YOUR VOICE, EH?

494
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,536
LIKE, FOR INSTANCE,
whisper the nouns

495
00:20:40,536 --> 00:20:42,972
AND SHOUT THE VERBS!!!

496
00:20:42,972 --> 00:20:44,874
I DON'T THINK THE
AUDIENCE WOULD
LIKE THAT.

497
00:20:44,874 --> 00:20:46,843
IT'S HARDER TO
SLEEP THROUGH.

498

THE MOST IMPORTANT
ONE OF ALL, "C,"

499
00:20:50,246 --> 00:20:54,584
HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY
WORTH LISTENING TO, EH?

500
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:56,819
YEAH, WELL, MY ADVICE
TO THIS PERSON IS

501
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:01,457
GET UP THERE AND JUST
TELL THE FILTHIEST
JOKE YOU KNOW.

502
00:21:01,457 --> 00:21:03,459
THAT'S EXACTLY WHY
YOU WERE NEVER INVITED BACK

503
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:05,695
TO GIVE A GUEST SERMON
AT THAT CHURCH.

504
00:21:05,695 --> 00:21:07,396
WELL, I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
TO BREAK THE ICE, HAROLD,

BRING ANY BOOZE IN.

509
00:21:20,676 --> 00:21:22,545
WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THAT

IT LOOKED PERFECT

512

BUT IN REALITY THERE
WERE A FEW GLITCHES.

513

HA! GLITCHES?

514
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:33,122

WE HAD THAT CHAIR LIFT
HOOKED UP WITH THE
GOLFING EQUIPMENT.

517

WE HAD A GOLF DRIVING RANGE
WITH A BALL RETURN.

518

YOU'D STAND AT THE TOP
OF THE SKI RAMP,

519
00:21:40,196 --> 00:21:43,466
YOU'D DRIVE YOUR BALL DOWN
INTO NETS THAT WERE HANGING
FROM THE CHAIR LIFT,

520
00:21:43,466 --> 00:21:45,268
BRING THE BALL RIGHT
BACK UP TO YOU.

521
00:21:45,268 --> 00:21:48,604
WOULD HAVE WORK TOO
IF YOU DIDN'T USE THAT
SNOW MAKING MACHINE.

HAVE BEEN ALL RIGHT

STOPPED DRIVING GOLF
