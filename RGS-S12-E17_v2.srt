1
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:04,070
YOU EVER SEEN ONE
OF THESE?

2
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:07,374
IT'S CALLED A G.P.S.,
WHICH STANDS FOR --

3
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,009
WELL, WHO CARES?

4
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:11,044
THE POINT IS THIS
THING USES SATELLITES

5
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:12,412
TO TELL YOU WHERE YOU ARE,

6
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,948
WHICH MEANS THAT EVERY MAN
CAN HAVE A $500 REASON

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,217
NOT TO ASK FOR DIRECTIONS.

8
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:20,020
BUT THAT ISN'T NEARLY AS GOOD
AS WHAT I'VE COME UP WITH.

9
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:22,188
I GOT MYSELF ONE OF
THESE ANIMAL TAGS

10
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:23,923
THAT HAVE THE LITTLE
TRANSMITTERS IN THEM

11
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:25,325
THEY USE TO
TRACK ANIMALS.

12
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,093
YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN THEM ON
THOSE NATURE SHOWS

13
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,396
WHERE SOME ANIMAL LOVERS ARE
TRYING TO PROTECT THE SPECIES,

14
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,264
BUY SHOOTING THEM WITH A
TRANQUILIZER DART

15
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:33,833
AND THEN STAPLING ONE
OF THESE IN THEIR EAR.

16
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,835
WELL, HERE'S WHAT
I'VE DONE.

17
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,637
I'VE MADE EARRINGS

18
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,340
AND PUT ONE OF THOSE
TRANSMITTERS INTO EVERY PAIR.

19
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:41,808
BUT HERE'S THE BEST PART...

20
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,576
I MADE A WHOLE WHACK
OF THESE EARRINGS,

21
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,378
AND I GAVE THE PRETTIEST
PAIR TO MY WIFE BERNICE.

22
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,047
SHE'S OUT RIGHT NOW,

23
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:48,481
BUT I'M SURE
SHE'S WEARING THEM.

24
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,983
THAT'S WAY BETTER
THAN G.P.S., EH?

25
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:52,152
'CAUSE G.P.S. ONLY
TELLS ME WHERE I AM.

26
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,787
HEY, IF I'M HAVING
A GOOD TIME,

27
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,722
I DON'T CARE WHERE I AM!

28
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,390
BUT WITH THESE
TRANSMITTING EARRINGS,

29
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,259
EVERY TIME BERNICE
COMES HOME EARLY

30
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:00,860
OR SAUNTERS OUT
TO THE GARAGE

31
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:02,562
TO SEE WHERE THE
SMOKE IS COMING FROM,

32
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:04,164
THIS BABY STARTS BEEPING,

33
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:05,732
WHICH GIVES ME TIME
TO HIDE THE DAMAGE

34
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,267
OR AT LEAST COME UP
WITH AN EXCUSE.

35
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,002
[electronic beeping]

36
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:10,270
OH, MAN.

37
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,472
SHE WASN'T DUE BACK
FOR A COUPLE HOURS.

38
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,475
HI, HONEY!

39
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:18,011
[beeping continues]

40
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,186
[beeping slowly dies]

41
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:33,793
[cheers and applause]]

42
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,898
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

43
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,103
I APPRECIATE THAT.

44
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:48,408
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.

45
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,580
WELL, I HAD QUITE AN
EXPERIENCE LAST NIGHT,

46
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,281
AND WHEN I GOT HOME,

47
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:57,684
BERNICE WAS STANDING THERE,
WEARING HER COAT

48
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:59,786
AND I COULDN'T SMELL DINNER
COOKING OR ANYTHING.

49
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:03,156
I NOTICED THAT THE
POWER WAS STILL ON.

50
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,891
AND THEN IT STRUCK ME...

51
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:07,594
IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY.

52
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,230
SO I DECIDED TO TAKE HER
OUT TO THE DINNER THEATRE

53
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,199
UP IN PORT ASBESTOS,
BECAUSE...

54
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,835
SHE'D ALREADY BOUGHT
TICKETS FOR THAT.

55
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,738
UNCLE RED!

56
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:23,576
[cheers and applause]]

57
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,412
YOU WENT OUT
LAST NIGHT.

58
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,515
HOW WAS THE
DINNER THEATRE?

59
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,416
OH, MY GOSH,
I'LL TELL YOU,

60
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,018
THAT CHEZ RALF, 
IT'S A RIP-OFF.

61
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:34,587
THIRTY BUCKS, YOU GET
THREE LITTLE POTATOES;

62
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:37,323
YOU GET A DINNER ROLL
LIKE A GOLF BALL --

63
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,426
AND I'M TALKING
WITH THE BACKSPIN.

64
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,029
AND THEY GIVE YOU SOME
SORT OF A CORNISH
CHICKEN THING

65
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:46,032
THAT HAD THE MUSCLE
MASS OF A CHIUHUAHUA.

66
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:48,001
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY...

67
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:51,304
A FOOL AND HIS MONEY
EAT AT RALF'S.

68
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,940
AND THE PLAY,
OH, MAN, BRUTAL.

69
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,010
YEAH, IT WAS CALLED
"THE MOUSETRAP".

70
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,811
SO I'M WAITING
AND I'M WAITING.

71
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,414
THE ONLY MOUSE I SAW
COME OUT OF THE KITCHEN.

72
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,750
IN FACT, I THINK
THEY KEEP MICE IN THERE,

73
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:06,052
IN CASE SOMEBODY
ORDERS RIBS.

74
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,923
OH! OH! OH!

75
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:11,457
YOU KNOW WHAT
WE COULD DO?

76
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:12,926
KNOW WHAT WE COULD DO?
KNOW WHAT WE COULD DO?

77
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,895
WE COULD OPEN OUR
OWN DINNER THEATRE.

78
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,764
YEAH, THAT PORCH BEHIND
THE LODGE THERE,

79
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:20,466
IT HOLDS, LIKE,
100 PEOPLE.

80
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:24,270
YEAH, AND AT 30 BUCKS
A PLATE, THAT'S...

81
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,838
A LOT.

82
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,308
OH, WE'RE GONNA
NEED A PLAY.

83
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,243
WELL, WE'LL JUST TAKE
AN EXISTING PLAY,

84
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,078
AND WE'LL CHANGE IT
JUST A LITTLE BIT.

85
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,980
NOBODY AROUND HERE WILL
NOTICE, THAT'S FOR SURE.

86
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:38,551
OH, OKAY, WELL, WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO ABOUT ACTORS?

87
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,853
HAROLD, WHENEVER
YOU HAVE MARRIED MEN,

88
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,889
YOU HAVE ACTORS.

89
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,134
IT'S TIME FOR THE
POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

90
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:58,471

"WE WENT ON A LONG TRIP
RECENTLY AND MY WIFE
WAS DRIVING,

"SO I GOT A CHANCE TO
LOOK OUT THE WINDOWS.

TWO COUPLES IN THE SAME CAR

WELL, YOU GOTTA LOOK AT THE
LEVEL OF CONVERSATION
THAT'S GOING ON.

136
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,660
LIKE, UH, IF THE MEN
ARE DOING THE TALKING,

137
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,362
THEY'RE DATING.

138

THEY'RE MARRIED.

140

YOU KNOW, WHEN HAROLD HAD
HIS FIRST BUSINESS TRIP
LAST YEAR,

155
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,207
THE GUYS AT THE LODGE WERE SO
HAPPY HE WAS GOING AWAY,

156
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:51,411
THEY ALL CHIPPED IN AND GOT
HIM ONE OF THESE LAPTOP
COMPUTERS.

157
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,813
THE PROBLEM IS THE
NAME LAPTOP SCARES ME

158
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:56,816
BECAUSE HAROLD'S LAP IS NO
PLACE FOR ANYTHING VALUABLE.

159
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,885
WHICH GOT ME THINKING...

160
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,087
IF THEY CAN MAKE
A PORTABLE COMPUTER,

161
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:04,056
WHY CAN'T SOME GOOFBALL
MAKE A PORTABLE DESK.

162
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,792
WELL, GUESS WHAT...

163
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,627
SOME GOOFBALL HAS.

164
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:12,031
NOW, THIS MAY LOOK LIKE A
REGULAR GARMENT BAG,

165
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,534
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A BUSINESS
TRAVELLER'S DREAM.

166
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,502
IF YOU DO A LOT
OF BUSINESS TRAVEL,

167
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,371
IT MIGHT BE A
RECURRING DREAM --

168
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,039
OR A RECURRING NIGHTMARE,

169
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,507
DEPENDING ON
WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

170
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,476
NOW, INSIDE, ON TOP,

171
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:25,144
WE HAVE OUR NEATLY
FOLDED SUITS.

172
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:31,117
AND UNDERNEATH WE HAVE OUR
NEATLY FOLDED DESK.

173
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,154
TV TRAYS: THEY'RE NOT JUST FOR
PATHETIC BACHELORS ANY MORE.

174
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,790
AND OF COURSE, YOU'VE GOTTA
HAVE A FLASHLIGHT

175
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,625
AND A CLOTHES HANGER.

176
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,260
THOSE ARE ESSENTIALS
FOR ANY EXECUTIVE.

177
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,496
WHO WANTS A DESK
WITHOUT A DESK LAMP?

178
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,200
NOW, THE REST IS UP
TO YOUR IMAGINATION.

179
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,069
THE GARMENT BAG ITSELF
BECOMES MY MODESTY PANEL.

180
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:53,973
AND I'VE ADDED A PANT HANGER
WITH THE METAL CLIPS
TO MY DESK LAMP.

181
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,275
OF COURSE, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
HANG YOUR PANTS ON THERE,

182
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,311
UNLESS YOU WORK
FOR THE GOVERNMENT.

183
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:01,180
INSTEAD, YOU'RE GONNA HANG
THE BEST PART OF YOUR PANTS,

184
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,883
YOUR WALLET,
OR AS IT'S ALSO KNOWN...

185
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,819
YOUR ROLODEX.

186
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:10,923
AND OF COURSE,
YOU CAN'T TRAVEL WITHOUT
TRAVELLING MUSIC.

187
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:15,127
TRANSISTOR RADIO OUGHTA
TAKE CARE OF THAT, HUH?

188
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:18,931
[signal not tunning in]

189
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:25,571
[country music plays]

190
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:28,474
OKAY, NOW ALL WE NEED IS ONE
OF THOSE FANCY NAME PLATES,

191
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,910
TO ADD THAT FINAL
TOUCH OF SOPHISTICATION

192
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,883
AND THERE'S OUR
PORTABLE DESK.

193
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:39,018
IT'S QUICK,
IT'S SIMPLE,

194
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,820
AND IT'S READY
TO HIT THE ROAD.

195
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,155
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

196
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,891
THEY SHOULD --

197
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,596
[quirky upbeat music]

198
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,468
I WANNA TALK TO YOU
OLDER GUYS OUT THERE

199
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,170
ABOUT THE DANGERS OF
SHOPPING FOR YOUR WIFE.

200
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,573
MOST IMPORTANTLY, I'M TALKING
ABOUT HER REACTION

201
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,709
TO THAT GIFT
YOU JUST BOUGHT HER.

202
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:08,080
NOW, I KNOW SOME OF YOU HAVE
BEEN BUYING HER GIFTS
FOR 25 OR 30 YEARS,

203
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,916
AND YOU THINK YOU'RE
GETTING PRETTY GOOD AT IT.

204
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:12,518
WELL, YOU'RE NOT.

205
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,187
THE TRUTH IS THAT MEN
RUN OUT OF GOOD GIFT IDEAS

206
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,391
AFTER ABOUT THE
FIFTH YEAR OF MARRIAGE.

207
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:21,360
THAT'S WHEN THE PHRASE,
"OH, I LOVE IT HONEY.

208
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:23,429
"IT'S JUST WHAT I WANTED."

209
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:26,032
IS REPLACED WITH,
"DID YOU KEEP THE RECEIPT?"

210
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:28,501
I KNOW WE'VE
ALL BEEN THERE.

211
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,038
THAT TIME YOU BOUGHT HER THE
PICTURE OF THE DOGS
PLAYING POKER.

212
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,574
OR THE YEAR YOU
ENROLLED HER

213
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,476
IN THE BARBEQUE SAUCE
OF THE MONTH CLUB.

214
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,345
REMEMBER WHEN
YOU GOT HER

215
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,881
THAT HILARIOUS FISH THAT SINGS
WHEN YOU CLAP YOUR HANDS?

216
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,951
[chuckling]

217
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,387
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
THE GOOD NEWS IS, EH?

218
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,122
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET
TOO UPSET ABOUT IT,

219
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,325
BECAUSE ALL YOU GOTTA REMEMBER
IS ONE IMPORTANT THING

220
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,060
WHEN YOU'RE SHOPPING
FOR YOUR WIFE...

221
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:57,697
MEN ARE FROM MARS;
WOMEN HAVE TASTE.

222
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,666
SO THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE
SHOPPING FOR A GIFT
FOR YOUR WIFE,

223
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,602
LOOK AROUND THE SHOP.

224
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,937
IF YOU SEE SOMETHING KINDA
SPECIAL, SOMETHING UNIQUE,

225
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,306
SOMETHING YOU WOULD HONESTLY
LIKE TO HAVE YOURSELF,

226
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,275
GET THE HECK OUTTA THERE,

227
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,777
BECAUSE, BUDDY, YOU'RE
IN THE WRONG STORE!

228
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,613
REMEMBER,
I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

229
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:18,050
WE'RE ALL IN
THIS TOGETHER.

230
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,488
WELL, BUSTER HADFIELD
WROTE UP THE SCRIPT

231
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,223
FOR OUR DINNER
THEATRE PLAY.

232
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:25,958
REHEARSALS START TODAY.

233
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,761
I'M NOT ACTUALLY IN IT
BECAUSE I'M ALLERGIC
TO VEGETABLES,

234
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,165
ESPECIALLY WHEN PEOPLE ARE
WINGING 'EM AT ME.

235
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,668
UNCLE RED!

236
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:39,572
[wolf whistles and applause]

237
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,449
[louder wolf whistles]

238
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,453
IT'S NOT A
BALLET, YOU KNOW?

239
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,522
THIS IS AN ACTING
TECHNIQUE.

240
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,457
WE HAVE TO DIVEST OURSELVES
OF OUR OWN PERSONAS

241
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:01,460
SO WE CAN TAKE ON
A NEW CHARACTER.

242
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:04,497
AND IN YOUR CASE,
IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA.

243
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,365
THERE'S A TYPO
IN THE SCRIPT, RED.

244
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,334
BUSTER CALLED IT
"THE MOOSE TRAP",

245
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,136
INSTEAD OF
"THE MOUSETRAP".

246
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:12,038
NO, NO, NO.
IT'S NOT A TYPO.

247
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,839
IT'S "THE MOOSE TRAP".

248
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,042
OKAY, IT'S LOOSELY BASED
ON "THE MOUSETRAP".

249
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,747
IT'S IDENTICAL!

250
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,749
SAME PLOT,
SAME CHARACTERS.

251
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,384
NO, NO, SEE?

252
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,053
OURS IS CALLED
"THE MOOSE TRAP".

253
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:30,189
THAT WAY WE DON'T HAVE
TO PAY ANY ROYALTIES.

254
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:32,258
"THE MOUSE TRAP" HAS BEEN
RUNNING FOR 50 YEARS.

255
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,393
WE'RE NOT GONNA
FOOL ANYBODY.

256
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,328
DON'T BE SO SURE, HAROLD.

257
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,963
THE MAYOR OF POSSUM LAKE HAS
BEEN RUNNING FOR 60 YEARS,

258
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:40,433
AND HE STILL
FOOLS EVERYBODY.

259
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,668
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE NEED YOU TO REHEARSE THIS.

260
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,670
ANN MARIE IS GONNA
BE IN THE AUDIENCE,

261
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:47,506
AND I GET ENOUGH
BAD REVIEWS AT HOME.

262
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,909
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
LET'S DO, UH,

263
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,777
ACT THREE, SCENE FOUR,

264
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,180
"THE BLOODY
AFTERMATH".

265
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,115
NOW, UNCLE RED,
AS AN ACTOR,

266
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:58,017
I'M NOT SURE OF MY
MOTIVATION IN THE SCENE.

267
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,952
I WAS HOPING MAYBE YOU
COULD HELP ME WITH THAT.

268
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,388
YES. YES,
I CAN, HAROLD.

269
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:05,257
SO YOUR MOTIVATION

270
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,227
IS TO DO WHAT IT SAYS
IN THE SCRIPT.

271
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,763
OR WE GET SOMEBODY
ELSE TO PLAY THE PART.

272
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:14,967
OKAY, SEE,
I NEEDED THAT.

273
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,002
YES. YES,
I DID TOO.

274
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,405
ALL RIGHT, DALTON, GO AHEAD.
YOU'VE GOT THE FIRST LINE.

275
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,640
IT'S JUST THAT I'M
NERVOUS, YOU KNOW.

276
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,776
AND I DON'T WANT WANNA BE
THE WORST ONE UP THERE.

277
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:27,747
YOU'VE GOT SOME
NERVE, LITTLE MAN,

278
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,550
BUT MAYBE IF WE...
WORK TOGETHER...

279
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,920
WE COULD FIND A COPY
OF THE OLD LADY'S...

280
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,591
WILL!

281
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,926
LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE SAFE.

282
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,628
I THINK SO!

283
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:49,235
Red: I WAS KILLING TIME
OUT BEHIND THE LODGE
 
WAITING FOR WALTER.

284
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,936
HAD SOME DRUM STICKS. 

285
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,538
YOU KNOW, YOU GET 
DRUMMING AWAY THERE, 

286
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,006
AND YOU GOTTA GET 
A BEAT GOING.
 

287
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,574
WALTER HAD KIND OF 
A CHINESE THING GOING,  

288
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,209
WHICH IS PERFECT 

289
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,711
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND 
IT AT FIRST,
 

290
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,946
BUT APPARENTLY HE'D GOTTEN 
HIMSELF SOME NEW LITTLE TOY
 

291
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,581
THAT HE WANTED TRY, 

292
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,316
HE WANTED ME TO BE 
THE GUINEA PIG ON.
 

293
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,786
THEY USE THESE THINGS NOW IN 
SOME OF THE BIG CITIES. 

294
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:09,021
NOT JUST IN CHINA, 
BUT EVERYWHERE. 

295
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,323
I THINK IT'S CALLED 
A RICKSHAW.
 

296
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:14,026
BOY, THEY PACK UP PRETTY 
SMALL FOR THE SIZE OF IT.
 

297
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,695
SO WALTER WANTED ME 
TO GET IN THERE,
 

298
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,832
SO, ALL RIGHT, 
I'LL GIVE THAT A CHANCE. 

299
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:23,102
GONNA FEEL LIKE THE 
SHAW (Shah) OF SOMEWHERE.
 

300
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,204
I'M SITTING THERE, 
AND HE TAKES HER --
 

301
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,473
DON'T EXACTLY UNDERSTAND 
THE PHYSICS OF THIS, 

302
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:28,741
AND I'M QUESTIONING IT --  

303
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,709
OH! OH! 
THAT HAS GOTTA HURT. 

304
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,912
SO APPARENTLY I WASN'T 
SITTING FAR ENOUGH BACK. 

305
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,581
YOU'VE GOT TO PUT 
THE WEIGHT BACK,
 

306
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,383
LIKE IT IS ON MY AUNT. 

307
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,318
AND THERE, LOOK AT --  

308
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:43,222
THE WAY HE RUNS 
SCARES ME.
 

309
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:45,558
BUT AS WE STARTED 
GOING UP A HILL,
 

310
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,293
AGAIN, I GUESS MY WEIGHT 
WAS TOO FAR FORWARD, 

311
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,028
AND HE STARTED TO DIG 
IN A LITTLE BIT,
 

312
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,831
SO HE ASKED ME IF 
I WOULD MOVE BACK.
 

313
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:55,100
AND YOU KNOW, I PROBABLY 
OVER CORRECTED. 

314
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,445
AND I KNEW THIS 
CAN'T BE GOOD.
 

315
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,514
OH! OH! 

316
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,149
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? 

317
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,451
THAT'S ENOUGH FUN 
FOR ME FOR ONE DAY.
 

318
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,320
WHY DON'T YOU GET 
IN THERE, WALTER,
 

319
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:16,188
AND I'LL TRY? 
YES, I'LL TRY.
 

320
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:20,125
BUT I'M NOT ACTUALLY 
GONNA PULL IT MANUALLY.  

321
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,864
SEEMS LIKE A BETTER 
IDEA TO ME.
 

322
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:30,069
NOW, MY PLAN WAS TO TAKE 
HIM UP ONTO THE FOUR-LANE,  

323
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:33,672
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, I HAD 
TO GO UP A HILL FIRST, 

324
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:36,809
AND SOME OF THE HILLS AROUND 
POSSUM LODGE 

325
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:39,011
ARE NOT ALL THAT SMOOTH, 
AND I HIT A POTHOLE. 

326
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,580
I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE 
HAD SOME KIND OF A HITCH 

327
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,883
BECAUSE, UH -- 

328
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,018
SOME -- 

329
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:49,588
WE DECIDED WE SHOULD JUST 
PUT THE RICKSHAW AWAY
 
FOR THE DAY.

330
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,660
AND I CAME IN THERE, 
HOPING WALTER WAS OKAY.
 

331
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:56,962
AND IT WAS LIKE 
GOING TO THE VET,
 

332
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,231
LIKE THOSE DOGS WEAR. 

333
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,066
THAT WAS JUST HIS HAT. 

334
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:03,035
I TOOK THAT OFF, 
AND THAT DAMAGED HIS EARS.  

335
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,503
THEN I COULD YELL AT HIM. 

336
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,505
IT WAS A GREAT HAT. 
IT WAS A GREAT DAY.
 

337
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,741
AND WE'LL PROBABLY 
NEVER DO IT AGAIN.
 

338
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,444
[quirky upbeat music]

339
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,782
OH, HI, EVERYBODY.
RANGER GORD HERE,

340
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,385
WITH ANOTHER ONE OF MY
ANIMATED EDUCATIONAL SHORTS.

341
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,121
NOW, THIS PARTICULAR ONE
IS ALL ABOUT POLLUTION.

342
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:25,658
AND MORE SPECIFICALLY,
I'M AGAINST IT.

343
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,693
YOU KNOW, WHEN I'M
IN THE GREAT OUTDOORS,

344
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,795
I ALWAYS HARKEN BACK
TO THAT OLD ADAGE...

345
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:32,865
TAKE NOTHING BUT PHOTOS,
LEAVE NOTHING BUT FOOTPRINTS.

346
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,801
UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU'RE
DOING SOMETHING WEIRD,

347
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,903
IN WHICH CASE, THOSE THINGS
WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU

348
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,571
AS EVIDENCE LATER ON.

349
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:40,673
[chuckles]

350
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,041
SERIOUSLY.

351
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,377
ANYWAY, ENJOY THE FILM.

[quirky upbeat music]

354
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,195
HI, FOLKS.

355
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,730
TODAY I'M GONNA TEACH
THE WHOLE WORLD

356
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,198
TO CLEAN UP ITS ACT.

357
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,933
BUT FIRST,
WE NEED A MASCOT.

358
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,869
WHY, HERE'S A
CUTE LITTLE FELLOW.

359
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:13,872
CAN YOU SAY,
GIVE A HOOT, DON'T POLLUTE?

360
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:16,575
CAN YOU SAY
TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT?

361
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,978
UH, RIGHT THEN.

362
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,213
LET'S BEGIN OUR LESSON
WITH NOISE POLLUTION.

363
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:30,622
[rock music blasting]

364
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:34,126
NOW, OBVIOUSLY, WE CAN'T
HAVE THIS KIND OF NOISE
IN THE FOREST.

365
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:35,728
IT'S IMPOLITE,
IRRESPONSIBLE

366
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,230
AND INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS.

367
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:41,433
SO IS THE MUSIC!

368
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,769
AND HERE COMES
THE HIBERNATING BEAR

369
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,372
WE JUST WOKE UP
TO FINISH THE JOB.

370
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,542
OHH-AWW!
WHAT DO WE DO, GORD?

371
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,144
I KNOW.

372
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,680
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THIS
MOTORCYCLE TO SAFETY?

373
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,616
GOOD IDEA.
HEY, SWEET RIDE.

374
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:01,320
YEAH, SWEET NITROUS OXIDE
RIDE, YOU MEAN.

375
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,956
GREENHOUSE GASES ARE A
CONSTANT THREAT TO US ALL.

376
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,725
BUT FORTUNATELY, YOU CAN'T
DO TOO MUCH DAMAGE...

377
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,599
WITH A POTATO IN
YOUR TAILPIPE.

378
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,541
I'M GONNA PUT A POTATO
IN YOUR TAILPIPE, GORD.

379
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,210
WELL, THERE'LL BE PLENTY
OF TIME FOR RECREATION
LATER, RED.

380
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,813
NOW, LET'S FLY THIS CHOPPER!

381
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,522
Red: I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
MAKING US PICK UP LITTER
IN THE DARK.
 

382
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,892
Gord: THE POLLUTION SOLUTION
IS A 24/7 JOB, RED.

383
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,294
NOW YOU KNOW WHAT
I GO THROUGH EVERY DAY.

384
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,797
Harold: WOW! IT'S AMAZING
HOW MUCH GARBAGE

385

PEOPLE LEAVE AROUND
A CAMPSITE.

386
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,768
Gord: ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT A
CAMPSITE AT ALL, HAROLD.

387
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,137
YOU'VE BEEN CLEANING MY
PLACE FOR THE PAST HOUR.

[laughing]

389
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,576
AH! THIS ISN'T
YOUR APARTMENT, GORD.

390
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,878
YOU'RE RIGHT.
WHO'S PLACE IS THIS?

391
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,249
[screaming]

392
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:08,153
WELL, FOLKS, WE'VE HAD
A LOT OF FUN TONIGHT.

393
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,756
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
FUNNY ABOUT POLLUTION.

394
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,125
YOU SAID IT, PAUL
THE POLLUTION BEAR.

395
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:14,560
WHEW!

396
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,895
SO HE WAS YOUR
MASCOT ALL ALONG.

397
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,530
I THOUGHT HE WAS
GOING TO ATTACK US.

398
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:19,998
OH, PAUL'S STILL
GOING TO ATTACK YOU.

399
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,900
GIVING ENVIRONMENTAL
TIPS IS HIS JOB.

400
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:25,237
EATING YOU IS JUST --
WELL, IT'S JUST A PERK.

401
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,539
AH! WAIT A SECOND, PAUL.

402
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,875
YOU DON'T WANNA EAT ME.
I'M, UH, POLLUTED.

403
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,877

IT'S TRUE!

PRETTY WELL.

WE DECIDED TO SERVE
HAMBURGERS.

OF HOT DOGS ON STAGE.

IS THE PLAY OVER?

WELL,
FOR US IT IS.

414
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,417
THAT IS THE WORST
AUDIENCE I HAVE EVER SEEN.

415
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,053
THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO
APPRECIATE GOOD TALENT.

416
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,456
WE DON'T KNOW THAT, HAROLD.

417
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,525
THEY WERE THROWING
FRENCH FRIES AT US.

418
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,160
IT WAS HUMILIATING.

419

WELL, LOOK AT THE
BRIGHT SIDE.

420
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,563
AT LEAST WE DIDN'T
GIVE THEM CUTLERY.

THE PLAY WERE YOU?

424
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,472
WE WERE AT THE
MURDER SCENE.
WINSTON WAS DYING.

WE ALL WERE.

WELL, THAT'S ENOUGH
OF THAT!

428
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:55,294
THAT AUDIENCE HAS NO
RESPECT FOR THE DEAD.

THE DEAD, WINSTON.

00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:36,561
Red: SIT DOWN.

462
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:39,264
ALL RIGHT, MEN, BOW YOUR HEADS
FOR THE MAN'S PRAYER.

463
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,867
I'M A MAN,
BUT I CAN CHANGE,

464
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,137
IF I HAVE TO, I GUESS.

465
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,906
ALL RIGHT, MEN, THE
WHOLE DINNER THEATRE THING,

466
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:50,242
THAT'S ALL OVER WITH.

467
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,210
AND WE HAVE SOME
FOOD LEFT OVER.

468
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:55,180
WE'VE GOT 40 POUNDS
OF GROUND BEEF,

469
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:58,016
65 POUNDS OF FRENCH FRIES,

470
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,119
AND I'M NOT EXACTLY
SURE HOW MUCH HAM.

471
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:04,222
WHAT DO YOU GUYS WEIGH?

00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:09,061
