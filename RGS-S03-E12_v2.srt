THERE'S NOBODY OUT THERE

51
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,477
MAYBE A FEW FISHERMEN.

52
00:01:51,477 --> 00:01:52,879
THEY DON'T MIND AT ALL

53
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,913
IN FACT I THINK FISH ARE EASIER

54
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:58,818
TO CATCH WHEN THEY'RE STAMPEDING

55
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,520
UNFORTUNATELY THIS MONDAY

WE MET UP WITH A BUNCH OF

57
00:02:01,487 --> 00:02:05,024
YUPPIES OUT ON A CANOE TRIP.

58
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:05,992
>>HAROLD: I HOPE 'MET UP'

59
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,994
DOESN'T MEAN SMASHED INTO YOU

60
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:10,897
KNOW MOST YUPPIES ARE LAWYERS.

61
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:11,831
>>RED: WELL THEY'RE SURE NOT

62
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:15,868
SWIMMERS I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

63
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:16,736
TOOK US OVER AN HOUR TO GET

64
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:21,340

66
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,075
ANYBODY WE SHOULD BE SUING THEM

67
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:25,478
I MEAN THE CEDAR STRIP CANOES

68
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,746
AREN'T TOO BAD BECAUSE THEY

69
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:27,880
KIND OF SPLINTER UP WHEN

70
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,582
YOU RAM THEM

71
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:30,516
YOU SHOULD SEE THE DAMAGE THAT

72
00:02:30,516 --> 00:02:31,918
A LOON CANOE CAN DO TO A PROP

73
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:35,588
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE DOING

74
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:39,058
FULL TILT IN HER THERE.

75
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:39,959
>>HAROLD: I'M NOT SAYING THAT

76

79
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:44,397

80
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:45,398
IS GOING TO BE HANDING YOU

81
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:46,599
A LEGAL DOCUMENT THAT'S GOING

82
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,567
TO BE CHANGING THE QUALITY

83
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:50,536

91
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:04,150
THEIR CANOES OFF THE LAKE.

92
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,984
>>HAROLD: I DON'T THINK YOU

93
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:05,818
SHOULD MAKE JUDGMENTS

94

CALL THEM WUSSES.

>>RED: YEAH WELL THAT'S

101
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,127
ROUGHLY WHAT THEY ARE HAROLD

102
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:16,295
A WUSS IS ANYBODY THAT DIDDLES

103
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:17,396
AROUND IN A CANOE AND THEN

104
00:03:17,396 --> 00:03:18,598
WHINES WHEN THEY'RE T-BONED

105
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:25,338
BY A LODGE MEMBER.

106
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,039
>>HAROLD: THAT IS YOUR OPINION.

107
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,574
>>RED: FINE.

108
00:03:28,574 --> 00:03:29,375
>>HAROLD: AND THAT'S WHAT

109
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,109
MAKES IT A JUDGMENT AND

110
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,877
THAT'S MY OPINION.

111
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:32,878
>>RED: IT'S NOT A JUDGMENT

112
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:34,747
HAROLD, I DON'T JUDGE PEOPLE

113
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:35,648
AND ANYBODY WHO SAYS I DO IS

114
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,983
A CROSS-EYED, PENCIL-NECKED,

115
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:46,092
RUBBER-HEADED GEEK.

116
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,832
WHEN HUNTING SEASON'S OVER

117
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:55,501
NOBODY'S ON A BENDER

118
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,703
WE'RE TOO BUSY WITH

119
00:03:57,703 --> 00:03:59,238
ROPES AND DUCT TAPE

120
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:03,008
TYING CARCASSES TO FENDERS

121
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:04,577
A BULL-LINE OR A CLOVE HITCH

122
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,012
IT'S EASY TO GET IT WRONG

123
00:04:07,012 --> 00:04:08,647
LIKE ONE TIME A GUY TIED

124
00:04:08,647 --> 00:04:11,684
A MOOSE TO HIS FRONT WHEEL

125
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:12,751
LOOKED PRETTY FUNNY

126
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:14,987
SPINNING AWAY OUT THERE

127
00:04:14,987 --> 00:04:16,555
BUT IT WAS SAFE UNTIL

128
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:20,126
HE TRIED TO PASS A CYCLIST

129
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,994
>>RED: THIS WEEK ON

130
00:04:21,994 --> 00:04:23,629
'HANDYMAN CORNER' WE'RE

131
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:24,497
GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO

132
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:25,598
TURN AN OLD CANOE INTO

133
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,299
SOMETHING THAT WILL NOT ONLY

134
00:04:27,299 --> 00:04:28,601
GET YOUR NEIGHBOURS TALKING

135
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,635
IT MAY EVENTUALLY LEAD

136
00:04:29,635 --> 00:04:30,669
TO A FOR SALE SIGN

137
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:32,238
ON THEIR FRONT LAWN.

138
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,372
NOW I'M SURE A BUNCH OF YOU

139
00:04:33,372 --> 00:04:34,373
HAVE HEARD THE JOKE ABOUT

140
00:04:34,373 --> 00:04:35,541
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

141
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,476
A CANOE AND A LODGE MEMBER?

142
00:04:37,476 --> 00:04:40,479
A CANOE TIPS...

143
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,548
WELL ACTUALLY CANOES AND LODGE

144
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:43,516
MEMBERS HAVE A HECK OF A LOT

145
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:46,452
IN COMMON, THEY BOTH ARE ALL

146
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,255
FULL OF DENTS AND STUFF

147
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:57,730
(CRASHING & BANGING)

148
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,597
BUT OTHER THAN THAT THERE'S

149
00:04:58,597 --> 00:05:00,032
QUITE A DIFFERENCE.

150
00:05:00,032 --> 00:05:01,066
BUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE WOULD LOOK

151
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:02,635
AT AN OLD CANOE LIKE THIS

152
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,602
AND THEY'D JUST SAY WELL

153
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:04,770
THAT'S JUST A LEAKY OLD BOAT

154
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,238
MORE HOLES THAN ANYTHING ELSE

155
00:05:06,238 --> 00:05:07,740
AND BUT THE HANDYMAN HE SEES

156
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,408
THIS AS POTENTIAL BECAUSE YOU

157
00:05:09,408 --> 00:05:11,377
COULD TURN THIS INTO SOMETHING.

158
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,879
YOU COULD MAKE IT, WELL YOU

159
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,347
COULD MAKE IT A REALLY BIG

160
00:05:15,347 --> 00:05:20,586
DINNER BELL OR A FIRM HAMMOCK

161
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:21,387
OR YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE YOU COULD

162
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:22,321
MAKE OUT OF ONE OF THESE

163
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:24,690
IS A PORCH SWING.

164
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,727
YEAH, YEAH, A PORCH SWING.

165
00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:30,396
OKAY STEP ONE YOU GOT TO CUT

166
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,064
ONE OF THE SIDES PORT OR

167
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:33,365
STARBOARD WHICHEVER ONE HAS

168
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:36,902
THE MOST DENTS IN IT

169
00:05:36,902 --> 00:05:40,739

I GUESS HE HAD A HANG GLIDER

474
00:15:33,931 --> 00:15:35,766
IN HIS TENT, I DON'T

475
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:37,234
SEE ANYTHING IN THERE.

476
00:15:37,234 --> 00:15:38,202
AND HE'S SAYING NO, NO,

477
00:15:38,202 --> 00:15:39,236
THERE'S NOT A HANG GLIDER

478
00:15:39,236 --> 00:15:40,604
IN THE TENT THE HANG GLIDER

479
00:15:40,604 --> 00:15:42,339
IS THE TENT GOING TO CONVERT

480
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:44,141
THIS VERY STRANGE BUT I'M

481
00:15:44,141 --> 00:15:47,878
NOT GOING TO DO IT

482
00:15:47,878 --> 00:15:48,879
SO I'M ALL FOR IT.

483
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:50,147
SO HE PILES HER A LITTLE HIGH

484
00:15:50,147 --> 00:15:51,215
THERE BILL GOING TO BE A LITTLE

485
00:15:51,215 --> 00:15:52,482
DIFFICULT TO SEE JUST EXACT

486
00:15:52,482 --> 00:15:53,584
BUT IT'S A NICE DAY FOR A WALK

487
00:15:53,584 --> 00:15:54,551
OH HE'S GOING TO COME

488
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:57,521
BACK AND GET ME.

489
00:15:57,521 --> 00:15:58,488
NOW HE'S TRYING TO GUIDE

490
00:15:58,488 --> 00:16:00,224
ME AND I'M NOT SURE

491
00:16:00,224 --> 00:16:01,391
THIS WAS THE MOST BRILLIANT

492
00:16:01,391 --> 00:16:02,426
THING WE'VE DONE ALL DAY

493
00:16:02,426 --> 00:16:04,795
BUT THAT WOULD BE A CHALLENGE.

494
00:16:04,795 --> 00:16:06,663
OH I SAW HIM GO DOWN AND

495
00:16:06,663 --> 00:16:08,665
I'M USING ALL THOSE TENT POLES

496
00:16:08,665 --> 00:16:11,068
SO I JUST HANDED THAT TO HIM

497
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:12,135
WHAT I'D FORGOTTEN OF COURSE

498
00:16:12,135 --> 00:16:14,538
WAS THAT THEY WERE A SECTIONAL

499
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:16,740
THING AT THIS POINT I THOUGHT

500
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,908
HE WAS JUST ENJOYING HIMSELF

501
00:16:17,908 --> 00:16:19,509
SO I LET GO OF THE LAST BIT

502
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:20,711
AND THEN HE HOLDS ONE AND

503
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:22,946
