1
00:00:01,868 --> 00:00:04,237
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,974
AND NOW, HERE'S THE REASON

3
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:10,610
GOD CREATED NO-FAULT INSURANCE,

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,145
THE ALL-FAULT GUY,

5
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:14,781
YOUR HERO, MY UNCLE, RED GREEN!

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,618
(Applause and cheering)

7
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,620
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

8
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,155
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

9
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:23,790
WELL, SHE'S A BIG DAY

10
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,692
FOR A SPECIAL YOUNG MAN

11
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:27,193
HERE AT POSSUM LODGE.

12
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,695
HAROLD,

13
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,830
YOU GOT AN
ANNOUNCEMENT?

14
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:32,332
NO.

15
00:00:32,398 --> 00:00:33,833
OH, COME ON NOW.

16
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,135
HE'S A LITTLE SHY.

17
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,302
HAROLD HAS GOTTEN

18
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,770
HIS DRIVER'S LICENSE.

19
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:39,139
HE'S WELL ON HIS WAY

20
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,406
TO BECOMING A MAN,

21
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:41,641
BECAUSE NOW HE HAS

22
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,476
A REASON TO GET A VEHICLE.

23
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,946
ONCE HE GETS THAT VEHICLE,
HE WILL BE A MAN,

24
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:49,649
UNLESS IT'S, LIKE,
AN '87 SUNBIRD.

25
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:53,653
OK, OK, YEAH, OK, YES,
I TOOK THE DRIVING TEST.

26
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,389
BUT I HAD SOME MISHAPS,
SOME MISCUES,

27
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:57,891
AND PROPERTY DAMAGE.

28
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:59,392
YOU FLUNKED AGAIN?

29
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:00,894
YEAH.

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,863
I HAD THE SAME
DRIVING EXAMINER AS LAST TIME.

31
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,099
THERE'S ONLY ONE
DRIVING EXAMINER

32
00:01:06,165 --> 00:01:07,767
IN THE POSSUM LAKE AREA.

33
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,569
I SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED THAT.

34
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,971
SHE GAVE ME
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT,

35
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:14,974
UNTIL I RAN OVER HER FOOT --
I DIDN'T SIGNAL.

36
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,143
YEAH, I KNOW.

37
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,178
SAME FOOT AS LAST TIME --
SHE WAS TICKED.

38
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,782
YOU GOT TO GET RIGHT BACK UP
ON THAT HORSE.

39
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:25,218
YOU GOT TO GO THERE TOMORROW
AND TAKE THE TEST AGAIN.

40
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:26,719
NO, I CAN'T DO THAT.

41
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:28,221
WHY NOT?

42
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,657
THERE'S VARIOUS REASONS,
BUT NUMBER ONE IS THAT

43
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:32,292
THE TEST CAR DOESN'T COME BACK

44
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:34,360
FROM THE AUTOBODY SHOP
TILL NEXT WEEK.

45
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,162
THAT WILL SLOW ME UP SOME.

46
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:39,766
SHE SAYS I HAVE TO TAKE LESSONS
BEFORE I CAN RETEST.

47
00:01:39,832 --> 00:01:44,237
NOBODY IN THEIR RIGHT MIND
WOULD GIVE YOU DRIVING LESSONS.

48
00:01:44,303 --> 00:01:45,738
YOU WILL? -- THANK YOU.

49
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:50,743
(Horns honking)

50
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,346
(Geese honking)

51
00:01:54,847 --> 00:01:56,849
(Quacking)

52
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:02,355
(Red): YOU'RE LOOKIN'
AT SEGMENTS

53
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,090
FROM THIS PARTICULAR SHOW,

54
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:05,625
THE MAIN MESSAGE BEING,

55
00:02:05,691 --> 00:02:08,094
FOR GOSH SAKES,
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT

56
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,595
CHANGING THE CHANNEL.

57
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:11,731
TO MAKE SENSE
OUT OF THIS PROGRAMME,

58
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,168
YOU GOTTA GIVE IT
YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.

59
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,275
IF ANY OF YOU
ARE DRIVING INSTRUCTORS,

60
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:24,944
I'LL TELL YOU,
YOU ARE ALL UNDERPAID.

61
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,580
IT SAYS "DRIVER WILL COME TO
A COMPLETE STOP

62
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,916
"FOUR METERS PRIOR TO
THE INTERSECTION,

63
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:32,652
"CREEP FORWARD,
COME TO
 ANOTHER
 COMPLETE STOP,

64
00:02:32,718 --> 00:02:34,954
"PRIOR TO ENTERING
SAID INTERSECTION."

65
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,956
THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE,

66
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:40,193
THOSE WHO DO THINGS,
AND THOSE WHO WRITE MANUALS.

67
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:42,628
A ROLLING STOP IS FINE.

68
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,230
(Laughing)

69
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,933
ROLLING STOP DOESN'T MEAN
ROLLING OVER.

70
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:49,835
WE WERE AROUND THAT CORNER
ON TWO WHEELS.

71
00:02:49,902 --> 00:02:52,705
THE POSSUM VAN ONLY HAS
TWO GOOD WHEELS.

72
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,907
BESIDES,
THERE WAS NOBODY COMING.

73
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:57,410
SO YOU STOP
WHEN YOU SEE CARS COMING?

74
00:02:57,476 --> 00:02:58,911
YEAH...

75
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:02,148
IF IT'S GOT LIGHTS ON THE ROOF.

76
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:05,685
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
IF YOU'RE GOING TO TEACH ME

77
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:08,654
TO DRIVE, IT HAS TO BE BY
PROPER TRAFFIC RULES.

78
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,757
IN 35 YEARS,
I'VE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM.

79
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:14,460
YOU HAVEN'T,
BUT EVERYONE ELSE SURE HAS.

80
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,796
DO YOU WANT TO BE ON THE ROAD

81
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:19,999
DRIVING WITH PEOPLE
WHO DRIVE LIKE YOU?

82
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,636
I THOUGHT NOT.

83
00:03:24,503 --> 00:03:27,673
(Red): LATER ON WE'VE GOT
AN ADVENTURE WITH BILL

84
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,575
FEATURING TENNIS, OBVIOUSLY.

85
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,444
HE'S JUST WARMING UP A BIT.

86
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,045
GIVE ME THE RACQUET.

87
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,680
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

88
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:37,850
OW, OW, OW.

89
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,518
YEAH, ALL RIGHT,

90
00:03:39,585 --> 00:03:42,955
SO, HE'S GOT THE WARM-UP BALLS
THERE, AND THE VARIOUS

91
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,890
ANIMAL-TRAP CONTAINERS THERE.

92
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:46,392
AWAY YOU GO, BILL.

93
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:47,893
GET OVER THERE.

94
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,395
GO ON, GET OVER THERE.

95
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,896
AWAY YOU GO.

96
00:03:50,963 --> 00:03:52,398
GET OVER THERE.

97
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:55,367
HE MAY NOT BE QUITE FIT ENOUGH
FOR THIS...

98
00:03:55,434 --> 00:03:57,203
TENNIS HAS A LONG HISTORY

99
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:59,905
OF PEOPLE
WHO SHOULDN'T BE PLAYING IT.

100
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:02,241
SO WE'RE RIGHT IN LINE
WITH THAT.

101
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:05,077
IT'S MORE OF
AN OLDER PERSON'S GAME.

102
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:06,912
OH, YOU GOT YOUR BOUNCER.

103
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:08,414
OH!

104
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,683
IT WAS A POOR CHOICE.

105
00:04:10,749 --> 00:04:12,751
BUT HE'S ALL RIGHT.

106
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:14,720
OH, OH, GOLLY!

107
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,222
THE RACQUETS

108
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:18,023
ARE MUCH BIGGER THESE DAYS.

109
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,758
I GUESS BILL DIDN'T KNOW--

110
00:04:19,825 --> 00:04:21,360
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

111
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,028
YOU JUST NEED A COUPLE.

112
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:25,331
YOU NEED
JUST A COUPLE IN THERE.

113
00:04:25,397 --> 00:04:26,899
OH.

114
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:30,503
IT'S LIKE THAT BIG BUCKET
OF FRIED CHICKEN.

115
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:33,005
SERVES 20.

116
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,940
OH BOY.

117
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:38,444
HE'S STARTING TO LOOK
A BIT LIKE A CHICKEN, ISN'T HE?

118
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:39,945
WOW.

119
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:42,448
WAY YOU GO, WAY YOU GO.

120
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,884
OH, MAN, MISTER AGILITY.

121
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,886
MAKE A WISH.

122
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:48,387
THERE WE GO.

123
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,889
HE CAN'T HANDLE THE HEAT.

124
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:51,523
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

125
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,025
OH, ALL RIGHT.

126
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,494
NO, THAT'S AN APPLE.

127
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,863
BILL, BILL.

128
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,798
THAT'S AN APPLE.

129
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:04,403
OH, BOY, HE'S GOT
A WICKED SLICE.

130
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,107
OH, WELL, THERE'S AN UP SIDE.

131
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:11,744
OHHH

132
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,746
MY UNCLE
HAS A DAIRY FARM

133
00:05:13,812 --> 00:05:15,281
A MAN
WHO LIKES TO PUTTER

134
00:05:15,347 --> 00:05:17,116
HE SLIPPED AND FELL OFF
THE ROOF ONE DAY

135
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:18,851
AND LANDED IN THE BUTTER

136
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:20,619
HE FLIPPED AND FLOPPED
FOR AN HOUR OR MORE

137
00:05:20,686 --> 00:05:22,521
TILL HE WAS RESCUED
BY HIS WIFE

138
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,490
SHE WARNED HIM THAT BUTTER
IS BAD FOR HIS HEALTH

139
00:05:24,556 --> 00:05:28,293
BUT HE CLAIMS
IT SAVED HIS LIFE

140
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,229
THIS IS FOR THE BIG ONE,

141
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:33,365
A WATER-BALLOON LAUNCHER
AND 40 AIR-SICK BAGS.

142
00:05:33,432 --> 00:05:36,068
YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO GET MR. FRANKLIN

143
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,569
TO SAY THIS WORD.

144
00:05:37,636 --> 00:05:39,938
CANADA.

145
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:41,106
CANADA.

146
00:05:41,173 --> 00:05:42,274
AND GO!

147
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,709
ALL RIGHT,
DOUGIE,

148
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,878
A COUNTRY.

149
00:05:45,944 --> 00:05:48,414
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

150
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,717
OK, THIS IS AMERICA'S
LARGEST TRADING PARTNER.

151
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:54,586
THE DALLAS COWBOYS.

152
00:05:54,653 --> 00:05:56,088
NO -- I'M TALKING ABOUT

153
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,490
THE SECOND BIGGEST COUNTRY
IN THE WORLD.

154
00:05:58,557 --> 00:06:00,793
IT'S GOTTA BE TEXAS.

155
00:06:00,859 --> 00:06:02,294
THINK COUNTRY, OK?

156
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:05,964
THIS IS A COUNTRY
DIRECTLY NORTH OF AMERICA.

157
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:08,000
ALASKA.

158
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:11,136
THE LONGEST UNDEFENDED BORDER
IN THE WORLD

159
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:13,438
IS BETWEEN THE U.S.A. AND...

160
00:06:13,505 --> 00:06:14,940
FRANCE,
I BELIEVE.

161
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,441
(Laughing)

162
00:06:16,508 --> 00:06:17,943
MONSIEUR.

163
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,312
DOUGIE, I WAS BORN
IN THIS PLACE.

164
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:23,682
HOME FOR UNWED MOTHERS.

165
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:25,918
(Laughing)

166
00:06:25,984 --> 00:06:28,921
I'M TALKING ABOUT
WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.

167
00:06:28,987 --> 00:06:30,756
WHERE ARE WE, RIGHT HERE?

168
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:33,759
OH, OH,
ONTARIARI--
NO, NO, NO.

169
00:06:33,825 --> 00:06:35,160
MANITOULIN--
NO, NO, NO.

170
00:06:35,227 --> 00:06:36,662
NOVA SOMETHIN'.

171
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:38,630
THOSE ARE PROVINCES.

172
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:40,165
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

173
00:06:40,232 --> 00:06:41,433
WE'RE OUT OF TIME.

174
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,868
WAY TO GO.

175
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:46,371
OH, THAT'S STILL A COUNTRY?

176
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:49,741
(Laughing and applause)

177
00:06:49,808 --> 00:06:52,377
THIS WEEK
WE'RE GONNA MAKE A PROJECT

178
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:55,881
THAT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU
POPULAR WITH THE KIDS.

179
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:58,183
WE'LL BUILD OUR OWN
AIR-HOCKEY GAME.

180
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,319
YOU GOT TWO BASIC PRINCIPLES:

181
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:03,388
HOLES, AND YOU GOT WIND
GOING THROUGH THEM.

182
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:04,957
WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE.

183
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:06,892
YOU NEED A COUPLE OF DRYERS.

184
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,528
YOU CAN PICK THESE UP
AT A GARAGE SALE,

185
00:07:09,594 --> 00:07:11,129
OR IF YOU STAY UP LATE,

186
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:13,899
YOU CAN HOIST A COUPLE
OUT OF A LAUNDROMAT.

187
00:07:13,965 --> 00:07:15,334
THE DRYERS ARE FREE,

188
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,903
BUT THE QUARTERS
TO KEEP THEM RUNNING

189
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:19,738
WILL EVENTUALLY BREAK YA.

190
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:21,473
PLUG UP THE EXHAUST

191
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,844
SO THAT THE AIR WILL GO
WHERE YOU WANT IT TO GO.

192
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:27,779
THE VENT IS IN THE BACK.

193
00:07:27,846 --> 00:07:31,416
PLUG HER UP WITH A BALL
OR A SMALL HOUSEPLANT.

194
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:35,520
THESE UNITS ALREADY HAVE
A FAIR AMOUNT OF LINT BUILD-UP.

195
00:07:35,587 --> 00:07:37,622
THAT WILL DO THE JOB FOR US.

196
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:41,626
SOMEBODY MUST HAVE DRIED
A CAT IN THERE.

197
00:07:41,693 --> 00:07:44,329
PUSH THESE DRYERS TOGETHER.

198
00:07:44,396 --> 00:07:47,132
AND THEN KEEP THEM TOGETHER

199
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,770
USING THE HANDYMAN'S
SECRET WEAPON, DUCT TAPE.

200
00:07:51,837 --> 00:07:55,607
THERE'S ALWAYS ONE, ISN'T THERE?

201
00:07:56,942 --> 00:07:58,376
HA, HA, HA, HA, HA!

202
00:07:58,443 --> 00:08:00,011
SO THAT'S WHERE THEY GO!

203
00:08:00,078 --> 00:08:04,983
HOCKEY IS A REAL PHYSICAL GAME
WITH THE SLAP SHOTS

204
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,653
AND THE CROSS-CHECKING,
AND THE INEVITABLE FIST FIGHTS.

205
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,456
SO MAKE SURE
YOU HORSE THESE BABIES DOWN.

206
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:17,262
OK, REMEMBER THAT WE PLUGGED UP
ALL THE EXHAUST VENTS.

207
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:19,731
SO NOW WE PUNCH SOME HOLES
IN THE TOP

208
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:21,399
SO THE AIR WILL BLOW UP.

209
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:22,767
NOT BLOW UP -- BOOM.

210
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:24,436
BLOW UP -- PHHHT.

211
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,843
THIS COULD TAKE
LONGER THAN I THOUGHT.

212
00:08:44,422 --> 00:08:45,924
THERE WE GO.

213
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,695
BOY, THAT'S A LITTLE ROUGHER
THAN WHAT I...

214
00:08:50,762 --> 00:08:55,066
WHAT YOU DO NOW, OF COURSE, IS
YOU ADD ANOTHER LAYER ON THAT.

215
00:08:59,871 --> 00:09:02,741
OK, OUR NEW SURFACE NOW
WILL BE PEGBOARD.

216
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:07,379
YOU'LL PROBABLY FIND A HUNK
OF THIS OVER YOUR WORK BENCH.

217
00:09:07,445 --> 00:09:09,948
I NEVER USED IT ALL THAT MUCH
ANYHOW.

218
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:14,552
ACTUALLY, I DATED A GIRL
NAMED PEG BOARD.

219
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:16,888
SHE ENDED UP MARRYING
A REAL TOOL.

220
00:09:16,955 --> 00:09:18,923
WHEN YOU PUT THE PEGBOARD ON,

221
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,659
MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT
THE SMOOTH SIDE UP.

222
00:09:21,726 --> 00:09:24,195
THIS IS WHAT THEY CALL
GOOD-ONE-SIDE.

223
00:09:24,262 --> 00:09:28,233
COME TO THINK OF IT,
SO WAS THE GIRL I DATED.

224
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:29,734
WE GOT HER ALL SET.

225
00:09:29,801 --> 00:09:31,236
I GOT A JAR LID.

226
00:09:31,302 --> 00:09:32,737
THAT'S MY PUCK.

227
00:09:32,804 --> 00:09:35,440
AND I GOT BOWLS
TO HIT IT WITH.

228
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:39,110
THE BEAUTY OF USING A DRYER
IS YOU'VE GOT THE TIMER.

229
00:09:39,177 --> 00:09:43,047
EVEN GET A BUZZER THAT GOES OFF
WHEN THE GAME'S OVER.

230
00:09:43,114 --> 00:09:44,549
YOU CAN BE ANY TEAM.

231
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:47,051
IF YOU WANT TO BE
A EUROPEAN TEAM,

232
00:09:47,118 --> 00:09:48,953
JUST SET HER ON DELICATE.

233
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,956
REMEMBER, IF WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

234
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:54,459
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

235
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:56,561
IT'S HOCKEY NIGHT IN CANADA.

236
00:10:00,665 --> 00:10:02,100
(Crashing)

237
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:04,169
WOW, MY FIRST BREAK-AWAY.

238
00:10:04,235 --> 00:10:08,006
WHATEVER THIS IS,
WE GOT LOTS MORE OF IT.

239
00:10:13,077 --> 00:10:15,280
I WANT TO TALK TO
YOU OLDER FOLKS

240
00:10:15,346 --> 00:10:18,082
ABOUT A LITTLE SECRET
THAT WE ALL SHARE.

241
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:20,818
IT'S ABOUT SOMETHING CALLED
WISDOM.

242
00:10:20,885 --> 00:10:25,423
WE MAY NOT HAVE AS MUCH OF IT
AS YOUNG PEOPLE THINK WE DO.

243
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,525
NOW, I KNOW WE ALL KNOW

244
00:10:27,592 --> 00:10:30,361
THE FASTEST ROUTE
TO THE COTTAGE

245
00:10:30,428 --> 00:10:35,066
AND THE BEST FOOD AND
THE BEST MUSIC AND T.V. SHOWS.

246
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:40,238
THAT'S MORE A SIGN OF OUR MINDS
NARROWING, NOT DEEPENING.

247
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:43,841
WHEN I WAS LITTLE, I THOUGHT
ALL OLD PEOPLE WERE WISE,

248
00:10:43,908 --> 00:10:46,244
UNTIL THEY'D OPEN THEIR MOUTHS.

249
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:49,514
THEN I'D REALIZE,
"WHAT A STUPID OLD COOT."

250
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,883
(Laughing)

251
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:57,488
SO AS YOU GET ON IN YEARS,
LEARN TO FAKE WISDOM...

252
00:10:57,555 --> 00:10:58,990
WITH SILENCE.

253
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:00,958
IF YOU DON'T HAVE
A KNOWING BRAIN,

254
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:02,694
FAKE IT WITH A KNOWING SMILE.

255
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:08,866
WHEN YOU NOD AND SMILE,
PEOPLE WILL THINK, WELL...

256
00:11:13,571 --> 00:11:15,006
EXACTLY.

257
00:11:15,073 --> 00:11:18,876
IN EXTREME CASES, YOU CAN ADD
A WINK AND A CHUCKLE.

258
00:11:18,943 --> 00:11:21,012
'CAUSE YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT SAYS.

259
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:22,513
WELL, THAT SAYS...

260
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,948
(Chuckling)

261
00:11:24,015 --> 00:11:26,651
(Laughing)

262
00:11:26,717 --> 00:11:31,289
REMEMBER, I'M PULLIN' FOR YA,
BECAUSE, WELL...

263
00:11:31,355 --> 00:11:33,124
(Chuckling)

264
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:34,292
(Coughing)

265
00:11:34,358 --> 00:11:36,294
THAT WASN'T TOO BAD, HAROLD.

266
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,396
OLD LADY BENKMAN YELLED A LOT

267
00:11:38,463 --> 00:11:41,466
BUT I THINK THOSE SHRUBS
WERE ALREADY DEAD.

268
00:11:41,532 --> 00:11:43,801
OH, THAT POSSUM VAN'S BIG, HUH?

269
00:11:43,868 --> 00:11:47,338
OOH, THAT'S GOT
SOME POWER THERE, I'LL TELL YA!

270
00:11:47,405 --> 00:11:48,673
YEAH, YEAH.

271
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:50,007
I MEANT TO TELL YOU.

272
00:11:50,074 --> 00:11:52,677
IT WILL GO FASTER
THAN SEVEN MILES AN HOUR.

273
00:11:52,743 --> 00:11:54,946
I WAS MAINTAINING
A SAFE SPEED LIMIT.

274
00:11:55,012 --> 00:11:56,280
IT'S NOT A GOLF CART.

275
00:11:56,347 --> 00:11:58,216
WHEN YOU STOP FOR A HITCHHIKER

276
00:11:58,282 --> 00:12:01,352
AND THEY SAY, "NO, I'M IN
A HURRY," THAT'S A CLUE.

277
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:04,155
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
IF YOU CAN SMELL

278
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:07,358
YOUR OWN EXHAUST, THAT'S NATURE
SAYING, "PICK UP THE PACE."

279
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:08,726
OK, THAT'S GOOD, OK.

280
00:12:08,793 --> 00:12:10,294
I CAN PICK UP THE PACE.

281
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:11,629
HOW WERE THE TURNS?

282
00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:14,465
UH, INTERESTING --
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE LETTING GO

283
00:12:14,532 --> 00:12:16,534
OF THE STEERING WHEEL
SOON ENOUGH...

284
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:19,737
UNLESS YOU MEANT TO MAKE
THE U-TURN IN THE TUNNEL.

285
00:12:19,804 --> 00:12:21,172
AGAIN, A GOOD POINT.

286
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:23,040
I'LL TRY TO REMEMBER THAT.

287
00:12:23,107 --> 00:12:25,643
PICK UP THE PACE,
WORK ON THE TURNS...

288
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,912
I GOT BRAKES DOWN COLD, THOUGH.

289
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:30,147
YOU SLAPPED THE BINDERS ON.

290
00:12:30,214 --> 00:12:32,917
THE WINDSHIELD'S HARD,
ISN'T IT?

291
00:12:32,984 --> 00:12:34,919
HOW'S YOUR HEAD?

292
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:37,421
I'M GONNA HAVE
A LUMP, YEAH.

293
00:12:41,993 --> 00:12:43,928
OHHH!

294
00:12:43,995 --> 00:12:47,398
ALL RIGHT, WELCOME TO
"AUTO BIOGRAPHY", WHERE, UH...

295
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:49,266
... MEMBERS OF POSSUM LODGE

296
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:52,003
GET TO HAVE REMEMBRANCES
OF CARS GONE BY.

297
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:53,571
WE GOT MIKE HAMAR HERE.

298
00:12:53,637 --> 00:12:57,475
MIKE'S GONNA TELL US ABOUT
HIS FAVOURITE CAR OF ALL TIME.

299
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,410
AW, THAT'S EASY, MR. GREEN.

300
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:00,745
CORVETTE STINGRAY.

301
00:13:00,811 --> 00:13:02,279
WHAT A SET OF WHEELS.

302
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:04,148
WHO COULD RESIST A 'VETTE?

303
00:13:04,215 --> 00:13:05,483
NOT ME.

304
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:07,451
NO.

305
00:13:07,518 --> 00:13:09,620
THAT WAS A BEAUTIFUL CAR, MIKE.

306
00:13:09,687 --> 00:13:12,523
I REMEMBER THE FIRST 'VETTE
I TOOK FOR A SPIN.

307
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:15,693
IT WAS PARKED IN FRONT
OF THE CONVENIENCE STORE...

308
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,095
KEYS IN THE IGNITION,
THERE... IDLING.

309
00:13:18,162 --> 00:13:19,597
MAN!

310
00:13:19,663 --> 00:13:23,467
SO YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY OWN
A CORVETTE.

311
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:27,071
WELL, NO, BUT, YOU KNOW,
FOR AN HOUR IT WAS MINE.

312
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:28,539
OH.

313
00:13:28,606 --> 00:13:32,910
AND FAST? SHE COULD OUTRUN
ANY POLICE CRUISER ON THE ROAD.

314
00:13:32,977 --> 00:13:34,745
THAT WAS ONE GREAT CAR.

315
00:13:34,812 --> 00:13:37,281
I KNEW GUYS
WHO USED TO BOOST A 'VETTE

316
00:13:37,348 --> 00:13:39,116
AND THEN SELL IT FOR PARTS.

317
00:13:39,183 --> 00:13:40,784
TO ME, THAT IS CRIMINAL.

318
00:13:40,851 --> 00:13:42,486
IT'S CRIMINAL.

319
00:13:42,553 --> 00:13:43,954
CUTTIN' UP
A 'VETTE.

320
00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:45,289
I MEAN, HUH!

321
00:13:45,356 --> 00:13:48,826
YOU KNOW, MR. HAMAR,
YOU MIGHT REMIND OUR VIEWERS

322
00:13:48,893 --> 00:13:52,296
THAT CAR THEFT OF ANY KIND
IS A BAD THING TO DO.

323
00:13:52,363 --> 00:13:53,631
A BAD THING TO DO.

324
00:13:53,697 --> 00:13:55,132
(Audience laughing)

325
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,368
OH, YEAH, WELL, YEAH, FOR SURE.

326
00:13:57,434 --> 00:14:00,304
YOU KNOW, I LOVE 'VETTES,
BUT I NOW KNOW

327
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:02,039
THAT A FEW HOURS OF FUN

328
00:14:02,106 --> 00:14:05,376
IS NOT WORTH TWO TO FIVE
IN MINIMUM SECURITY.

329
00:14:05,442 --> 00:14:09,847
SO I WOULD SAY IF YOU WANT
A CORVETTE, BUY ONE.

330
00:14:09,914 --> 00:14:12,650
YEAH, BUT THEY ARE EXPENSIVE,
ARE THEY NOT?

331
00:14:12,716 --> 00:14:16,387
YEAH, THEY ARE EXPENSIVE,
BUT IF YOU FIND THE RIGHT BANK,

332
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:19,456
LIKE ON A FRIDAY
WHEN THEY GOT A LOT OF CASH...

333
00:14:19,523 --> 00:14:21,125
(Audience laughing)

334
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:22,726
MIKE, NOW, REMEMBER

335
00:14:22,793 --> 00:14:23,994
HOW THAT
ENDED?

336
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:25,429
OH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

337
00:14:25,496 --> 00:14:26,931
YOU'RE RIGHT, MR. GREEN.

338
00:14:26,997 --> 00:14:28,432
I DON'T DO THAT NO MORE.

339
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:29,867
MAYBE YOU NEED

340
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:33,404
TO WORK HARD, SAVE YOUR MONEY,
BUILD UP A CREDIT RATING.

341
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,439
THEN YOU CAN GET
YOUR OWN CORVETTE,

342
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:36,974
ONE YOU ACTUALLY OWN.

343
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,910
THEN SOME LOSER SWIPES IT
FOR A JOY RIDE?

344
00:14:39,977 --> 00:14:41,412
NO, THANKS.

345
00:14:41,478 --> 00:14:43,881
(Audience laughing)

346
00:14:43,947 --> 00:14:46,283
(Red): AS I TRIED
TO WARN YOU EARLIER,

347
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,252
"ADVENTURES WITH BILL"
THIS WEEK

348
00:14:48,318 --> 00:14:49,887
IS AT THE TENNIS COURT.

349
00:14:49,953 --> 00:14:51,488
I FIRE ONE UP--

350
00:14:51,555 --> 00:14:52,956
OH! OHHH! OHHH!

351
00:14:53,023 --> 00:14:54,558
ALL THE BALLS

352
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,893
CAME OUT OF HIS PANTS.

353
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:57,494
MAYBE THOSE ARE GALLSTONES.

354
00:14:57,561 --> 00:14:59,463
COULDN'T CARE LESS,
TO BE HONEST.

355
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,898
I'LL FIRE A FEW AT BILL.

356
00:15:00,964 --> 00:15:02,466
TRY THIS, BILL, TRY THIS.

357
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:04,234
JUST TRY AND RETURN

358
00:15:04,301 --> 00:15:05,803
THE SERVE -- TRY THIS.

359
00:15:05,869 --> 00:15:08,238
NO CHANCE!

360
00:15:08,305 --> 00:15:09,573
NO CHANCE.

361
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,341
WHAT? WHAT'S THE MATTER?

362
00:15:11,408 --> 00:15:15,045
YOU WUSS, GET BACK IN THERE
AND TAKE IT LIKE A MAN.

363
00:15:15,112 --> 00:15:16,480
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

364
00:15:16,547 --> 00:15:17,815
OHHH!

365
00:15:17,881 --> 00:15:19,149
ALL RIGHT.

366
00:15:19,216 --> 00:15:20,651
I'M STILL HERE.

367
00:15:20,717 --> 00:15:22,019
(Laughing)

368
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:24,455
YEAH, I KNOW, YOU'RE GONNA
JUMP UP AND DOWN.

369
00:15:24,521 --> 00:15:26,423
TRY THIS.

370
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,925
NO CHANCE.

371
00:15:27,991 --> 00:15:29,426
(Laughing)

372
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:32,095
BOY, TENNIS IS
A FUN, FUN, FUN GAME.

373
00:15:32,162 --> 00:15:33,430
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

374
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:34,765
OH! UH-OH!

375
00:15:34,832 --> 00:15:36,266
UH-OH!

376
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,935
HE'S GOT AN IDEA.

377
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:39,937
AHHHH!

378
00:15:40,003 --> 00:15:41,271
OK, I SEE.

379
00:15:41,338 --> 00:15:42,840
HE'S GONNA TAKE HIS RACQUET...

380
00:15:42,906 --> 00:15:45,108
YOU NEED SOMETHING
TO ATTACH THAT WITH.

381
00:15:45,175 --> 00:15:46,443
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

382
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,946
NOTHIN' IN THERE YOU CAN USE.

383
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:51,448
DON'T USE--
BILL, DON'T USE THAT.

384
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:53,350
BILL... BILL... BILL?

385
00:15:53,417 --> 00:15:55,452
TENNIS IS A CLASS GAME.

386
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,954
USE YOUR SHOELACES.

387
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,956
USE YOUR SHOELACES.

388
00:15:59,022 --> 00:16:01,225
YOUR SHOELACES... YEAH,

389
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,559
YOUR SHOELACES.

390
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:05,062
ALL RIGHT,
SO YOU DON'T HAVE SHOELACES.

391
00:16:05,128 --> 00:16:06,463
LOOK WHAT YOU GAINED.

392
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,965
(Laughing)

393
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:10,567
MAN! NOW, THERE'S A RACQUET.

394
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:15,105
NICE HIT!

395
00:16:15,172 --> 00:16:17,641
BEAUTIFUL! WHAT? OH!

396
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,142
OH!

397
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:21,612
(Bill): OHHHH!

398
00:16:21,678 --> 00:16:23,780
(Red): OHHH!

399
00:16:23,847 --> 00:16:25,349
BY GOLLY.

400
00:16:25,415 --> 00:16:29,119
SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TRY
TO CHEAT, BOYS AND GIRLS?

401
00:16:29,186 --> 00:16:32,422
I'LL GET THE TIN MAN
BACK TO THE LOCKER ROOM.

402
00:16:32,489 --> 00:16:34,091
AWAY YOU GO.

403
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:38,762
(Squeaking)

404
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:42,499
(Red): THANKS TO JIM JACKSON
FOR THIS CARVIN' OF HAROLD.

405
00:16:47,104 --> 00:16:49,773
WE GOT THE VAN DOWN
OFF THE GAZEBO.

406
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,244
WE CAN GO AGAIN IF YOU'RE SURE
WHICH PEDAL IS WHICH NOW.

407
00:16:54,311 --> 00:16:55,579
I PANICKED!

408
00:16:55,645 --> 00:16:56,913
I PANICKED, OK?

409
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:01,017
IT'S YOUR FAULT -- YOU TOLD ME
ALPHABETICAL ORDER.

410
00:17:01,084 --> 00:17:03,587
BRAKES, GAS --
ALPHABETICAL ORDER.

411
00:17:03,653 --> 00:17:05,622
I THOUGHT YOU MEANT
ACCELERATOR, BRAKES!

412
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:09,526
EVEN IF IT IS ACCELERATOR,
"E" COMES AFTER "B"!

413
00:17:09,593 --> 00:17:11,795
COME ON,
LET'S GO.

414
00:17:11,862 --> 00:17:13,263
NO MORE DRIVING FOR ME.

415
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,532
I'M GONNA CONCENTRATE
ON THE MANUAL.

416
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,167
YOUR TEST IS
IN TWO HOURS.

417
00:17:17,234 --> 00:17:19,636
YEAH, I KNOW,
SO HELP ME WITH THIS ONE.

418
00:17:19,703 --> 00:17:22,005
"TWO DRIVERS APPROACH
AN UNMARKED INTERSECTION

419
00:17:22,072 --> 00:17:23,340
"AT THE SAME TIME.

420
00:17:23,406 --> 00:17:25,275
"WHO HAS THE RIGHT OF WAY?"

421
00:17:25,342 --> 00:17:27,043
THE GUY IN
THE BIG TRUCK.

422
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:31,548
NO, THE GUY ON THE RIGHT
ALWAYS HAS THE RIGHT OF WAY.

423
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:34,351
UNLESS THE OTHER GUY
HAS THE BIG TRUCK.

424
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:35,685
CHECK THE MANUAL.

425
00:17:35,752 --> 00:17:37,020
CHECK THE
CEMETERY.

426
00:17:37,087 --> 00:17:39,389
(Audience laughing)

427
00:17:39,456 --> 00:17:42,425
A LOT OF YOU KIDS
ARE LOOKIN' FOR PART-TIME WORK.

428
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:43,994
GET YOURSELF EXTRA MONEY,

429
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,663
BUY SOMETHING
YOUR PARENTS THINK IS STUPID.

430
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:49,065
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU'LL COME
FACE TO FACE

431
00:17:49,132 --> 00:17:51,534
WITH A SAD FACT OF LIFE --
MINIMUM WAGE.

432
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:53,203
YOU'RE EXPECTED TO GIVE UP

433
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,338
ALL YOUR FRIDAY NIGHTS
AND WEEKENDS

434
00:17:55,405 --> 00:17:59,042
FOR A PAPER HAT, FRENCH-FRY
BASKET, AND FOUR BUCKS AN HOUR.

435
00:17:59,109 --> 00:18:02,178
IF IT WAS UP TO ME, I'D
GIVE YOU FIVE TIMES THAT MUCH

436
00:18:02,245 --> 00:18:05,248
FOR WEARING THE DORKY UNIFORM,
BUT IT'S NOT UP TO ME.

437
00:18:05,315 --> 00:18:08,551
MINIMUM WAGE IS ONE OF THOSE
THINGS LIFE THROWS AT YOU.

438
00:18:08,618 --> 00:18:10,420
IT'S A DOOR
WE ALL PASS THROUGH.

439
00:18:10,487 --> 00:18:12,856
IT MAY BE THE ONLY DOOR
YOU PASS THROUGH,

440
00:18:12,922 --> 00:18:14,491
SO WORK HARD, TOUGH IT OUT.

441
00:18:14,557 --> 00:18:15,992
IN NO TIME, YOU'RE MAKING

442
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:18,495
20, 30, MAYBE 40 CENTS
ABOVE MINIMUM WAGE.

443
00:18:18,561 --> 00:18:20,830
YOU'LL BE ON EASY STREET.

444
00:18:20,897 --> 00:18:23,533
WELCOME TO MY FAVOURITE PORTION
OF THE SHOW,

445
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,903
WHERE WE EXAMINE THOSE WORDS
MEN FIND SO HARD TO SAY...

446
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,005
(Audience):
"I DON'T KNOW!"

447
00:18:29,072 --> 00:18:30,340
EXCELLENT! WAY TO GO!

448
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:33,476
ON THE EXPERT PORTION,
JOINING MY UNCLE RED GREEN

449
00:18:33,543 --> 00:18:35,812
IS HIS BEST FRIEND
IN THE WHOLE ROOM,

450
00:18:35,879 --> 00:18:37,514
MR. DALTON
HUMPHREY!

451
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:41,684
(Applause and cheering)

452
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:45,088
OUR LETTER GOES, "DEAR EXPERTS,
I WANT TO COOK VEGETARIAN

453
00:18:45,155 --> 00:18:47,290
"BUT MEAT IS ALL
MY HUSBAND WILL EAT.

454
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:49,859
"HOW CAN I GET HIM TO EAT
A BALANCED DIET?"

455
00:18:49,926 --> 00:18:51,194
AHHHH!

456
00:18:51,261 --> 00:18:54,664
YOU GOTTA REMEMBER THERE ARE
TWO MAJOR FOOD GROUPS.

457
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:56,733
THERE'S MEAT AND THERE'S SALT,

458
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,536
SO YOUR HUSBAND'S ALREADY
HALF-WAY THERE.

459
00:18:59,602 --> 00:19:01,204
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

460
00:19:01,271 --> 00:19:03,940
HAVEN'T YOU FORGOTTEN,
LIKE, YOU KNOW,

461
00:19:04,007 --> 00:19:07,043
DAIRY AND FRUITS
AND VEGETABLES AND GRAINS?

462
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,645
WE HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN THEM.

463
00:19:08,711 --> 00:19:11,548
IF YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING GOOD
ABOUT SOMETHING--

464
00:19:11,614 --> 00:19:14,050
AMEN.
YEAH.

465
00:19:14,117 --> 00:19:16,486
(Humphrey): YEAH,
FOR A HEALTHY,

466
00:19:16,553 --> 00:19:17,887
BALANCED MALE DIET,

467
00:19:17,954 --> 00:19:20,456
YOU WANT TO VARY
YOUR KINDS OF MEAT.

468
00:19:20,523 --> 00:19:22,959
VARIETY OF CUTS,
VARIETY OF GRADES,

469
00:19:23,026 --> 00:19:24,894
VARIETY OF BARBECUE SAUCE.

470
00:19:24,961 --> 00:19:27,130
YOU KNOW,

471
00:19:27,197 --> 00:19:30,533
AROUND OUR HOME,
WE WILL HAVE AS MANY

472
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,270
AS 17 DIFFERENT KINDS
OF MEAT IN A WEEK.

473
00:19:34,337 --> 00:19:37,407
(Audience laughing)

474
00:19:37,473 --> 00:19:40,076
17 DIFFERENT KINDS OF MEAT?!

475
00:19:40,143 --> 00:19:41,978
(Laughing)

476
00:19:42,045 --> 00:19:44,113
WHAT BUTCHER SHOP
ARE YOU GOIN' TO?

477
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,884
YOU DON'T NEED A BUTCHER SHOP
WHEN YOU LIVE NEAR THE HIGHWAY.

478
00:19:47,951 --> 00:19:49,586
(Laughing and applause)

479
00:19:49,652 --> 00:19:51,087
OHHH...

480
00:19:51,154 --> 00:19:53,089
NO, NO.

481
00:19:53,156 --> 00:19:56,793
SO, UH, YOU'RE EATIN'
THE ROAD-KILL, ARE YOU, DALTON?

482
00:19:56,859 --> 00:20:00,330
WE'RE EATING ALL-NATURAL,
ORGANICALLY RAISED,

483
00:20:00,396 --> 00:20:04,133
FREE-RANGE, AUTOMOTIVELY
PROCESSED FOOD PRODUCTS.

484
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,302
SO, UH, DALTON, LIKE, UH...

485
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:10,039
HOW DO YOU COOK, YOU KNOW,
THE ROAD-KILL THING?

486
00:20:10,106 --> 00:20:11,641
WELL, IT'S NOT HARD.

487
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,977
MOST OF IT'S ALREADY GRILLED.

488
00:20:14,043 --> 00:20:16,045
(Audience laughing)

489
00:20:16,112 --> 00:20:18,548
(Laughing)

490
00:20:18,614 --> 00:20:21,484
BUT THAT'S GOTTA BE TOUGH.

491
00:20:21,551 --> 00:20:22,985
SOME TOUGH
MEAT, THERE.

492
00:20:23,052 --> 00:20:26,489
YEAH, SOME OF IT'S ALREADY
BEEN POUNDED TO PEMMICAN

493
00:20:26,556 --> 00:20:28,624
BUT AT THE POINT

494
00:20:28,691 --> 00:20:31,594
OF IMPACT, IT'S ALWAYS
PRETTY TENDER,

495
00:20:31,661 --> 00:20:34,831
AND WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS
PRESENTATION,

496
00:20:34,897 --> 00:20:37,066
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING LIKE
PRESENTATION--

497
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:38,401
OH, THAT'S TRUE.

498
00:20:38,468 --> 00:20:40,203
... TO ENHANCE THE FLAVOUR.

499
00:20:40,269 --> 00:20:42,538
WHAT WE DO,
WE'LL PAINT A WHITE LINE

500
00:20:42,605 --> 00:20:45,374
DOWN THE CENTRE
OF THE DINING ROOM TABLE...

501
00:20:45,441 --> 00:20:49,245
AND WE'LL SERVE OUR MEAL
SOMETIMES ON A HUBCAP.

502
00:20:49,312 --> 00:20:51,681
I CAN JUST PICTURE
YOUR WHOLE FAMILY

503
00:20:51,747 --> 00:20:53,583
BOWIN' THE HEADS FOR GRACE.

504
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:57,086
"LOOK BOTH WAYS
BEFORE YOU CROSS."

505
00:20:57,153 --> 00:20:58,588
EH?

506
00:20:58,654 --> 00:21:00,857
YEAH, I THINK SO.

507
00:21:00,923 --> 00:21:02,959
YEAH, YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW,

508
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:05,962
SOMETIMES WE'LL SING
A COUPLE OF VERSES --

509
00:21:08,397 --> 00:21:09,799
(Laughing)

510
00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:14,203
WELL, I HOPE YOU TWO CLOWNS
REMEMBER YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT.

511
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,305
WELL, THAT'S TRUE, HAROLD.

512
00:21:16,372 --> 00:21:19,041
TELL US MORE
ABOUT YOUR VEGETABLES.

513
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:21,511
(Audience laughing)

514
00:21:21,577 --> 00:21:24,180
HAROLD WENT DOWN
FOR HIS DRIVIN' TEST

515
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:26,349
SO I WOULD THINK THE EXAMINER

516
00:21:26,415 --> 00:21:30,052
WILL BE SUBMITTING HER
RESIGNATION ANY MOMENT NOW.

517
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,587
I GOT IT!

518
00:21:31,654 --> 00:21:32,955
I GOT IT, I GOT IT!

519
00:21:33,022 --> 00:21:35,024
I GOT IT -- WHAT'S THAT? IT!

520
00:21:35,091 --> 00:21:36,926
I GOT IT, IT, IT, IT!

521
00:21:36,993 --> 00:21:39,629
(Audience laughing)

522
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,068
HOW DID IT GO?

523
00:21:46,135 --> 00:21:47,403
I GOT IT.

524
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,771
OH.

525
00:21:48,838 --> 00:21:50,973
I GOT 61% ON THE WRITTEN TEST.

526
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,541
THE EYE EXAM WAS BAD,

527
00:21:52,608 --> 00:21:55,578
BUT I WAS LOOKING
INTO THE COFFEE MACHINE.

528
00:21:55,645 --> 00:21:58,914
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GOT YOUR
LICENCE -- CONGRATULATIONS.

529
00:21:58,981 --> 00:22:00,249
THANK YOU, YEAH!

530
00:22:00,316 --> 00:22:01,917
YOU'RE A BIG PART OF THIS.

531
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,252
I HAVE YOU
TO THANK.

532
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:06,288
HAVING A GOOD TEACHER
CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE.

533
00:22:06,355 --> 00:22:09,392
MY THIRD YEAR IN GRADE 9
WAS A WHOLE NEW WORLD.

534
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:12,094
THE HEAD DRIVING EXAMINER,
HE FIGURED

535
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:15,731
IF I GOT MY LICENCE,
I'D BE DRIVING INSTEAD OF YOU.

536
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:19,035
SAID IT WAS THE LESSER
OF TWO EVILS, AND I GOT IT.

537
00:22:19,101 --> 00:22:20,369
(Possum squeal)

538
00:22:20,436 --> 00:22:21,904
MEETING TIME, MEETING TIME.

539
00:22:21,971 --> 00:22:24,373
I CAN'T WAIT TO SHOW THE GUYS.

540
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,708
(Laughing)

541
00:22:25,775 --> 00:22:27,043
I GOT IT!

542
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:28,511
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

543
00:22:28,577 --> 00:22:31,213
I'M COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

544
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,082
I'M GONNA LET HAROLD DRIVE ME

545
00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:35,151
SO YOU MIGHT DUCT-TAPE
SOME TIRES

546
00:22:35,217 --> 00:22:36,952
TO THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE...

547
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:40,856
WAIT UNDER THE BASEMENT STAIRS
TILL I GIVE YOU THE ALL-CLEAR.

548
00:22:40,923 --> 00:22:43,392
THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

549
00:22:43,459 --> 00:22:46,729
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND MR. UNSAFE-AT-ANY-SPEED,

550
00:22:46,796 --> 00:22:50,566
AND THE WHOLE GANG UP HERE,
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

551
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:52,601
(Applause and cheering)

552
00:22:52,668 --> 00:22:54,570
(Possum squeal)

553
00:22:54,637 --> 00:22:56,071
(Harold): I GOT MY LICENCE.

554
00:22:56,138 --> 00:22:57,406
I GOT A LICENCE.

555
00:22:57,473 --> 00:22:58,741
I GOT A LICENCE.

556
00:22:58,808 --> 00:23:01,710
I'LL BE DRIVING,
NOW THAT I GOT A LICENCE.

557
00:23:01,777 --> 00:23:03,679
ANYBODY NEEDS A RIDE SOMEWHERE?

558
00:23:03,746 --> 00:23:05,181
I GOT MY LICENCE.

559
00:23:05,247 --> 00:23:06,515
(Red): HAROLD! HAROLD!

560
00:23:06,582 --> 00:23:08,884
(Harold): I GOT ONE OF THOSE.

561
00:23:08,951 --> 00:23:10,386
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

562
00:23:10,452 --> 00:23:12,221
MEETING TIME! MEETING TIME!

563
00:23:12,288 --> 00:23:14,690
YOU NEED A LICENCE
TO HAVE A MEETING.

564
00:23:14,757 --> 00:23:16,025
(Red): SHUT UP, HAROLD.
