1
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:43,810
We invite you and yours to join us and ours
for the next 30 minutes on the Red Green

2
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,948
Show. You know, time is money and this is
only half an hour, but it seems a lot longer,

3
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:50,283
you know, so it's really a bargain.

4
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:51,918
And I love doing this show.

5
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:56,189
I couldn't do it without my uncle and well,
because he's the head honcho around here.

6
00:00:56,222 --> 00:01:00,059
Well, that is until, of course, he realizes
that he's actually passed it, and that's the

7
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,594
day that I get to take over.

8
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:07,934
Oh, but until that time, here is the head
honcho, the big guy with the twinkle in his

9
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,903
eye and then the twilight of his career.

10
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,038
The current host of the red green show, Mr.

11
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:13,273
Red Green.

12
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,510
Thank you, Harold. Thank you.

13
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:18,978
Welcome to Possum Lodge.

14
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,547
That intro made me feel 20 years younger.

15
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,117
Well, I'm glad to hear that you feel 50
again.

16
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:28,821
You need me around here because without me,
you couldn't do this.

17
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:37,563
And if I could, I wouldn't herald something
going on with Bob Stevenson this week, I

18
00:01:37,563 --> 00:01:39,132
realize he's real excited about something or
other.

19
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:42,635
Well, maybe it's his job, you know, he works
for national resources.

20
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,005
Well, what could be exciting about that here
other than the government pension?

21
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:51,411
Well, maybe, just maybe he's like, created
some new oversized vegetable.

22
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:53,379
No, Harold, but I think your parents may
have.

23
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:56,616
Why are you being so cruel to me, what did I
ever

24
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:57,683
Do to you?

25
00:01:58,351 --> 00:01:59,919
Well, that introduction comes to mind.

26
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,521
Fair enough.

27
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,828
Now there's only two things that excite a man
expensive toys and real expensive toys.

28
00:02:09,862 --> 00:02:13,433
That was Bob. I'd say this toy has something
to do with golf since he happens to be a golf

29
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,367
like a maniac.

30
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,470
You think you think maybe like you bought
like a golf course?

31
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,606
Well, if he did, Harold, I'm going to go work
for natural resources.

32
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:22,442
Oh, yeah, right?

33
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,643
Too expensive, isn't it?

34
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,112
Yeah. Well, maybe he bought a golf ball.

35
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:29,782
You know it was orange ones with the huge
dimples on.

36
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:32,018
It could be like that or designer tease.

37
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,953
Maybe we got designer tees. They make
designer tees.

38
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:36,389
They made designer tees. He probably got
those or megaphone.

39
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:40,993
Maybe he got a megaphone, but then he could
just yell for really loud for.

40
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,597
If you got like. But, yeah, OK.

41
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,899
All right. How is he going to hold a
megaphone and his clubs?

42
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:53,005
Yeah. You know what it could be like a
customized, hat mounted mini megaphone and it

43
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:53,673
automatically

44
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,541
Dispenses keys right into the ground.

45
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,143
Back, back, back, back, back, back.

46
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,145
What it owes. That's what it got.

47
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,279
That's so great.

48
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:06,819
Harold, maybe you should just go right into
the next segment, you know, there's already

49
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,154
too much violence on television.

50
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:12,892
Ok? You picked up on that and you kept things
moving and everything that's good, you know,

51
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:14,393
shows you mellowed. Shut up, Harold.

52
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:15,928
You slip back a little bit there, though.

53
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,569
Hey, Bob, that new set of gloves came in
today.

54
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:25,304
I brought them over.

55
00:03:25,671 --> 00:03:27,306
Oh, that's great news, Marie.

56
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:31,610
This might be the set that helps me break
par or even break a hundred.

57
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:33,813
You've never broken a hundred.

58
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,048
Well, not on nine consecutive holes.

59
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:36,482
No.

60
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,218
Ok, bring them in, Dwayne.

61
00:03:39,418 --> 00:03:42,888
Oh, great. All right, that'll be two hundred
plus tax.

62
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:45,991
And then they're shipping and handling
delivery charges from the store over to here.

63
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:47,526
Let's just call that an even four hundred,
huh?

64
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,162
All right. Will you take a check?

65
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:52,131
Hmm. Oh, it's a government check.

66
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:54,734
I'm buying these for the Department of
Natural Resources.

67
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:57,903
I use them at work, you know, for checking
out nature and stuff.

68
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:01,006
Cash. Fine.

69
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,776
Well, I'm going to need a receipt.

70
00:04:03,809 --> 00:04:05,077
Oh, all right. Yeah, yeah.

71
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,145
Come on. Great.

72
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:09,048
Oh, I love the smell of new clubs.

73
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:10,616
It smells like victory.

74
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:14,019
Yeah. All right. Look, your receipt is in the
pocket with the TS.

75
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,254
Ok? Happy hacking!

76
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:16,255
All right. Go, Duane.

77
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,893
Thanks, Mary. Wait a minute.

78
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,263
Well, these are all woods.

79
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:27,433
So where are the irons?

80
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,235
Who needs irons?

81
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:32,071
Oh, trust me, these clubs are going to bring
your score right down.

82
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:39,979
Well, good kid golf was all drivers I've
ever tried golfing with just drivers.

83
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,548
No. Huh? Well, have you ever played a good
game of golf?

84
00:04:43,482 --> 00:04:44,984
No. Well, then what do you know?

85
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,486
Huh? Come on, just try it out one round,
huh?

86
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,256
Well, look at this. They're old, they're old
drivers.

87
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:51,891
I mean, there's no irons.

88
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:54,960
There's not even a putter. Oh, there's a
putter in here.

89
00:04:55,427 --> 00:04:58,731
Oh, Dwayne, you let the putter in the back
of the truck.

90
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,332
Oh, sorry. Mm-hmm.

91
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,868
Get just another set of golf clubs, did you,
bob?

92
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:06,272
Yeah. Murray is selling me these miracle
clubs.

93
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:10,909
They're supposed to reduce my score by half
or even to par.

94
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,911
Oh, that was the money back guarantee.

95
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:16,448
Oh, really? You actually guaranteeing
something yourself, Murray?

96
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,385
Well, why not? You know, if it doesn't work
out, I'll take them back.

97
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:21,453
If it does, I've unloaded a set of left
handed clubs.

98
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:29,962
What? Left what are all left, I got right
handed, Marie.

99
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:32,097
Well, just try it once.

100
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:34,600
Go backwards.

101
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:37,002
How can I do this and expect a half decent
score?

102
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:39,638
Have you ever gone backwards?

103
00:05:39,938 --> 00:05:42,241
No. Have you ever had a half decent score?

104
00:05:42,574 --> 00:05:45,677
No, Dwight.

105
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:50,049
Guess I'll try them. Tried just about
everything else.

106
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,484
We're possibly go wrong.

107
00:05:52,484 --> 00:05:53,018
I guess so.

108
00:05:53,018 --> 00:05:54,052
That's great. So what?

109
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:57,256
So yeah, you saw your take two hundred
strokes in nine holes, huh?

110
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,958
Yeah. Well, at least it's a step in the right
direction.

111
00:06:02,294 --> 00:06:06,565
All right. I'll give them a try again when
no one else is around.

112
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:10,869
I don't know. Might be just crazy enough to
do the trick.

113
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,137
Here's the putter.

114
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:21,947
Oh boy. They say on the river

115
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,482
A long time ago,

116
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:26,285
The paddle wheelers would come steaming to
and fro.

117
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:34,393
They wave and they'd whistle as they had it
from the locks, and they plow over a bunch of

118
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,495
swimmers and wipe out all the docks.

119
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:40,766
They leave arms and legs and deck chairs in
their wake.

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,636
But that much polluting the wonder the dams
in the lake.

121
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:51,577
Long time ago.

122
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:55,814
And the rivers in the wind and the paddle
wheelers and come.

123
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:08,660
This week in the handymen corner, we're
going to show you how you can make your own

124
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,861
cheap transportation.

125
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:13,465
You know what, with the price of the car is
getting up there where it's, I believe, well

126
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:18,270
over $500 now and even a motorcycle is going
to cost you ninety eight.

127
00:07:18,904 --> 00:07:21,473
So I say, why not do what the handyman does?

128
00:07:24,242 --> 00:07:25,477
Build yourself a moped?

129
00:07:26,378 --> 00:07:30,148
I picked up this bike for about five bucks
now at the police auction, but that's too

130
00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:35,420
much for you. You can get one for free over
at the public schools during nap time or, as

131
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,688
they call it, history class.

132
00:07:39,758 --> 00:07:45,664
All you need is some extra chain, a couple
of rolls of handyman, secret weapon duct tape

133
00:07:46,364 --> 00:07:52,337
and something to use as a motor to use a
chainsaw.

134
00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:57,609
But you couldn't use an outboard motor or
you don't care about going real slow.

135
00:07:57,642 --> 00:07:59,511
You can use one of them garage door openers.

136
00:08:00,278 --> 00:08:04,483
Ok, now first step is you've got to get the
pedals and the chain.

137
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:05,417
Oh boy,

138
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:06,618
Off the hook.

139
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:12,891
Well, OK, now there's a there's a trick to
this.

140
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,368
Yeah, I don't think that's the trick.

141
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:37,449
I know there might have been some kind of a
wrench or something to use on this.

142
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:42,587
Oh no.

143
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:45,090
Now.

144
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,027
Now.

145
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:55,500
Oh, yeah.

146
00:08:57,435 --> 00:08:59,938
Yeah. No.

147
00:09:19,524 --> 00:09:21,259
It's going to have a lot of miles out with
Hammond down.

148
00:09:33,538 --> 00:09:35,206
All right, don't try us on that off with a
hacksaw.

149
00:09:36,508 --> 00:09:38,510
You know, just ruin a perfectly good hacksaw
blade.

150
00:09:40,378 --> 00:09:48,720
Harold had the right wrench in his bike,
kept us safe these pedals because next week

151
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,955
we're going to show you how to make a foot
powered egg slicer.

152
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,229
All right. The next step is to get the chain
off the.

153
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:06,137
Now you'll find there's a there's one
special link on the chain.

154
00:10:06,137 --> 00:10:11,543
It just comes apart and you can you can try
that open or you can cut it off with snips or

155
00:10:12,577 --> 00:10:15,113
if you have a heavy vehicle at all, just
back right over the next thing.

156
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:21,386
Ok, no. The engine right onto the bike.

157
00:10:25,823 --> 00:10:34,465
Now I was going to bolt this onto the frame
of the bike, but I'm not sure how that would

158
00:10:34,465 --> 00:10:36,801
work, and at this point, I have no idea what
I was thinking of.

159
00:10:37,168 --> 00:10:41,639
So I think what I'll do is I'll use a few
key clamps and a little bit more of the handy

160
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,274
man's secret weapon duct tape.

161
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:46,911
And when you put it on, make sure you snug
her up.

162
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:52,383
Real good. You don't want this thing
whipping off between your legs 50 miles an

163
00:10:52,383 --> 00:10:55,320
hour. Or maybe you do.

164
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:59,457
You know, duct tape is great stuff, isn't
it?

165
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:00,758
You can build a house with this stuff.

166
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:02,460
Just make sure you smoother down good.

167
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,596
Nothing says poor craftsman like lumpy tape
another.

168
00:11:06,798 --> 00:11:10,568
In other words, you want to put a little bit
of slack in the chain, but not too much

169
00:11:10,568 --> 00:11:14,205
because you don't want that chain flopping
around, lapping into whatever you got

170
00:11:14,205 --> 00:11:17,775
flopping around. And it's a real eye catcher
as Nick.

171
00:11:17,842 --> 00:11:19,544
Imagine driving through the park in this.

172
00:11:19,544 --> 00:11:21,546
They're going to see you. Now let's get
real.

173
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:22,013
Go.

174
00:11:28,252 --> 00:11:29,821
There you have nothing to it.

175
00:11:30,054 --> 00:11:30,421
Nothing.

176
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:34,158
I got nothing I forgot to tell you to be
sitting on the bike.

177
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,593
When I started anyway.

178
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:40,431
Remember the next time the women don't find
you handsome, they should at least find your

179
00:11:40,431 --> 00:11:43,868
handy. Oh my golly, the Texas moped
massacre.

180
00:12:00,518 --> 00:12:05,022
It is winter. I shoveled my driveway, a snow
plow passes.

181
00:12:05,323 --> 00:12:11,229
The driver smiles, a wintry smile and waves
a hand as he fills my driveway with snow

182
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:14,098
again. I went back with my finger.

183
00:12:21,105 --> 00:12:21,939
I read them

184
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,641
On the car, have you?

185
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:26,711
Of course, yeah. Oh, yes, of course.

186
00:12:27,511 --> 00:12:29,247
Yeah, I went out for a quick 18.

187
00:12:30,681 --> 00:12:32,550
How's your new left handed woodworker?

188
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:36,487
Oh, well, better than I expected.

189
00:12:36,487 --> 00:12:39,757
You know, ask me how much better?

190
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:41,926
All right. How much better?

191
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,228
Six under par.

192
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:46,664
Oh no.

193
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:48,432
Oh, 18 holes.

194
00:12:48,432 --> 00:12:49,934
Sixty six strokes.

195
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:51,068
Oh, wow.

196
00:12:51,168 --> 00:12:52,303
Could you manage that?

197
00:12:52,303 --> 00:12:57,708
Well, two birdies, an eagle and a hole in one
on the fifth on the dog leg.

198
00:12:57,908 --> 00:12:59,543
On the dog leg.

199
00:12:59,944 --> 00:13:01,779
No one has ever done that on the course.

200
00:13:01,946 --> 00:13:04,749
No one. Oh, I was great.

201
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:09,353
That was great. Which will see me one stroke
bang right under the green.

202
00:13:09,387 --> 00:13:15,092
I sank a 20 foot putt with a, you know, a
goalie stick, a 12 hole.

203
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:18,596
I had 40 guys following me around and
applauding, applauding me.

204
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:21,165
An eagle. Can you believe this?

205
00:13:21,165 --> 00:13:23,634
Oh man. Oh man, oh man.

206
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:25,169
That's great. Congratulations.

207
00:13:25,603 --> 00:13:28,072
Oh, those are some miracle clubs there, Bob.

208
00:13:28,105 --> 00:13:29,807
Well, it's not just the clubs red.

209
00:13:30,241 --> 00:13:32,710
It was magic serendipity.

210
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:35,546
It was the greatest day of my life.

211
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,816
Oh, you'll never have another game like that
again.

212
00:13:39,283 --> 00:13:44,188
I know. I know this was the greatest day of
my life.

213
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:47,658
You know, I could play golf for another
hundred years and never have a game like that

214
00:13:47,658 --> 00:13:48,926
again, ever.

215
00:13:49,426 --> 00:13:50,895
I mean, this was the greatest day of my
life.

216
00:13:51,128 --> 00:13:54,798
This was it. It happened from now on.

217
00:13:54,798 --> 00:13:55,499
It's all.

218
00:13:56,901 --> 00:14:03,140
It's all downhill. I'll never play a game
like that ever again.

219
00:14:06,076 --> 00:14:10,114
I did it. I had a dream and.

220
00:14:11,882 --> 00:14:12,816
No, it's over.

221
00:14:17,488 --> 00:14:19,156
I have nothing left to live for, do I?

222
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:20,925
Oh, sure you do. I'm sure you do.

223
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:25,963
Well, how can you be six under par seven
under par?

224
00:14:28,632 --> 00:14:29,900
So there seven under par.

225
00:14:30,668 --> 00:14:32,736
I used to take seven strokes just for one
haul.

226
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:36,840
I mean, I may improve just a bit more, but
never like I did today.

227
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:40,377
Don't fall over.

228
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,782
What am I going to do now?

229
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,817
Well, you can

230
00:14:47,251 --> 00:14:48,886
Grab your putter and take up hockey.

231
00:14:53,223 --> 00:14:56,427
Well, this week on Adventures with Bill and
Bill said he wanted to do some fishing as I

232
00:14:56,427 --> 00:15:00,364
think the fishing line down, but he had he
had something else totally in mind.

233
00:15:01,498 --> 00:15:02,599
I've never seen one of these.

234
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,503
I heard about them. It's a kind of a rig
that you don't need a boat to go fishing.

235
00:15:06,503 --> 00:15:08,439
You put these, you put these big, huge.

236
00:15:09,473 --> 00:15:11,475
They don't call them flippers, but they look
like flippers.

237
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:13,410
But if they call them flippers, they
couldn't charge as much.

238
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:19,082
Put them on your feet and then you put the
rig in there and you just showing that they

239
00:15:19,082 --> 00:15:25,856
go on. Just like I say, not going quite as
easy as flippers, but they come off a lot

240
00:15:25,856 --> 00:15:29,693
easier. Anyway, he's going to have one
engine instead of two, I guess.

241
00:15:29,693 --> 00:15:31,228
And what you do is almost like a diaper
thing.

242
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:35,232
You step into the rig and it's basically a
portable fishing boat.

243
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:37,334
Kind of well.

244
00:15:37,768 --> 00:15:41,138
Oh boy, you don't want to be a fish looking
up at that point.

245
00:15:41,305 --> 00:15:42,840
Oh, OK.

246
00:15:43,874 --> 00:15:45,709
Well, we know where we're going with this,
don't we?

247
00:15:46,143 --> 00:15:52,349
Yeah. And he lost his tube, and it's called
a float tube.

248
00:15:52,382 --> 00:15:55,385
That's why I say that last night at this
time, Glenn, from the ladder, maybe a little

249
00:15:55,385 --> 00:15:58,956
bit lower and get the one foot in there and
then try to get the other to the other foot

250
00:15:58,956 --> 00:16:00,524
in there, too. Now that's only one.

251
00:16:00,824 --> 00:16:07,598
That's just. Oh, it's amazing you still want
to go fishing, Anthony.

252
00:16:07,698 --> 00:16:10,968
Now he's going to just put it on on the dock
and then just jump in, but the flipper and

253
00:16:10,968 --> 00:16:14,104
hook and between the boards, he didn't
notice that and I tried to point it out to

254
00:16:14,104 --> 00:16:19,009
him. But he just. You know, you pay for not
listening.

255
00:16:20,177 --> 00:16:23,680
Anyway, he finally got into it there and
then you wanted some help because you had to,

256
00:16:24,481 --> 00:16:28,251
you know, something handy around the dock
like a boat hook is such a handy thing you

257
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:29,720
never know what you're going to use it for.

258
00:16:31,822 --> 00:16:34,758
Now what I want to do is I had them all
because there's compartments in the float

259
00:16:34,758 --> 00:16:40,163
tube. You can put your tackle box in there
and your thermos and a flashlight because you

260
00:16:40,163 --> 00:16:41,198
don't know how long is going to be out
there.

261
00:16:41,465 --> 00:16:44,201
And the bait, I just kind of threw in there
and I thought.

262
00:16:45,402 --> 00:16:46,570
Keep them awake, you know?

263
00:16:47,337 --> 00:16:51,675
And the fishing rod, and he's ready to rip
us a little apron on the front goes right up,

264
00:16:51,675 --> 00:16:56,580
keep everything dry and even what's with the
ones that he could get out to where he wanted

265
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,448
to fish and look, I'm there.

266
00:16:58,648 --> 00:17:02,419
So I thought I'd just take the boat out and
kind of go boat and join them, you know?

267
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:03,854
And it looked like kind of fun.

268
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:07,491
But I had brought my fishing line, as I
said, if he got it.

269
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:09,259
What do you do with a real big one anyway?

270
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:10,961
Do you want me? Oh, come on over.

271
00:17:10,994 --> 00:17:14,865
But you know, by golly, when you get the you
get the nine point nine open up there, it

272
00:17:14,865 --> 00:17:17,134
kind of raises the boat a certain extent.

273
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,702
And she wasn't running real good.

274
00:17:18,702 --> 00:17:22,973
She was seemed to me she was running rich,
and I'm trying to adjust the mixture on that

275
00:17:22,973 --> 00:17:25,742
because you run the rate, you're going to
bring a lot of gas and harness.

276
00:17:27,911 --> 00:17:33,350
Oh, the thing was, I never I never did see
Bill, I went way up the link.

277
00:17:33,884 --> 00:17:37,587
I hope he's OK. I don't.

278
00:17:46,263 --> 00:17:50,901
Well, Buster Hatfield and I went down to the
store to ask Murray about the stolen clubs.

279
00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:53,770
Of course, Murray had denied everything
before we'd even asked.

280
00:17:54,137 --> 00:17:58,708
Duane nodded a lot and then he sold Buster,
a fishing hat that he'd made out of a guitar.

281
00:17:59,476 --> 00:18:03,546
Mr has trouble finding hats, but that small
round head of his fit perfectly into the

282
00:18:03,546 --> 00:18:08,251
sound hole had that kind of home straight
out here and three strings under each year.

283
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:12,088
He looked like somebody who'd stood too
close to the stage during a Pete Townsend

284
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:15,425
guitar solo on the way back to the lodge he
was.

285
00:18:15,725 --> 00:18:19,663
He was doing bar cards with his comb, and
then he got caught in a cross wind that

286
00:18:19,663 --> 00:18:22,365
produced about the loudest e minor seventh
I've ever heard.

287
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,601
Oh, uncle ran, excuse me.

288
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:29,339
But this has very little or nothing actually
to do with Bob's midlife crisis and his golf

289
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:31,775
clubs. I think your mind is kind of
wandering there.

290
00:18:32,242 --> 00:18:35,145
Well, my mind may wander Harold, but at least
it gets out once in a while.

291
00:18:36,579 --> 00:18:38,181
Ok, so where was I?

292
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:41,551
Oh yeah. The tuning pegs kind of shot up
Buster's nose there,

293
00:18:43,286 --> 00:18:45,388
But they by a possum.

294
00:18:45,855 --> 00:18:46,923
It's mating time.

295
00:18:47,123 --> 00:18:48,425
Come on, let's get downstairs.

296
00:18:48,425 --> 00:18:49,426
See what's going on.

297
00:18:49,893 --> 00:18:53,797
Yeah, OK, well, I'll just go head down to the
lodge meeting here, and we're going to try

298
00:18:53,797 --> 00:18:55,465
and find a new hobby for Bob.

299
00:18:56,366 --> 00:18:57,834
I wonder if he'd like Harold's job?

300
00:18:58,501 --> 00:19:00,670
Excuse me, a minute. Great.

301
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,239
Great. Great.

302
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:12,282
Great. Great.

303
00:19:12,382 --> 00:19:14,350
Great. Yes.

304
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:16,452
Yeah. All right.

305
00:19:23,126 --> 00:19:25,161
One. It's.

306
00:19:27,564 --> 00:19:31,768
Now, but all members please remove their
hats.

307
00:19:33,436 --> 00:19:37,640
Thank you, Mr Floor recognizes Noel
Christmas

308
00:19:39,242 --> 00:19:42,412
Bakery, right?

309
00:19:43,413 --> 00:19:46,549
I've got proof that Bob's new clubs are hot.

310
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,385
Oh, well, I know.

311
00:19:49,552 --> 00:19:52,322
I'm sorry, Bob, I couldn't have known that.

312
00:19:52,322 --> 00:19:54,991
Remember? Caveat emptor.

313
00:19:55,925 --> 00:19:56,960
Well, I don't care.

314
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,996
Oh, Bob, I'm going to have to impound those
as evidence.

315
00:20:00,163 --> 00:20:01,364
Take them down to the station.

316
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:04,067
Sorry. Oh, wait there.

317
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:13,242
Well, I want my money back, though, Murray.

318
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:14,677
Oh, sorry, no, can do.

319
00:20:14,911 --> 00:20:16,713
Bob, the goods have been confiscated.

320
00:20:16,713 --> 00:20:18,648
You see one more point.

321
00:20:18,981 --> 00:20:20,183
Bob Murray drink.

322
00:20:21,017 --> 00:20:24,020
You're all under arrest for dealing in
stolen goods.

323
00:20:24,787 --> 00:20:30,593
Oh. What are you accusing us of knowingly
dealing with stolen goods?

324
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,229
No, no, wait a minute. I didn't even know
that they were stolen.

325
00:20:33,262 --> 00:20:36,899
Yeah, he wasn't even there when the guy who
swiped them came to the store.

326
00:20:37,867 --> 00:20:39,602
I mean, we don't know any.

327
00:20:39,635 --> 00:20:41,671
We don't know anything. All right, Bob.

328
00:20:42,138 --> 00:20:43,239
You can go free. Go on.

329
00:20:43,773 --> 00:20:45,374
Murray, Duane, you're under arrest.

330
00:20:46,442 --> 00:20:48,778
We didn't know they were stolen.

331
00:20:48,978 --> 00:20:51,214
Now this guy just came into the store.

332
00:20:51,247 --> 00:20:55,585
He said he was going to become a missionary
and work in Africa, and he wanted to sell off

333
00:20:55,585 --> 00:21:00,690
his collection of left handed clubs to
finance his missionary work well and buy a

334
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,159
new hat. He went to Africa.

335
00:21:03,526 --> 00:21:05,728
Yeah, he got a missionary position.

336
00:21:09,098 --> 00:21:10,700
You got any proof, huh?

337
00:21:11,734 --> 00:21:13,369
I mean, can anybody here corroborate this
story?

338
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:20,109
Well, I think a refund might refresh my
memory memory.

339
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:26,249
Oh, well, how about a half a refund and a
game of golf with a debit brain here?

340
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:30,586
Well, Noel, I was there.

341
00:21:30,953 --> 00:21:36,092
It's all true. This guy was going to Africa
to convert heathens and stuff like that, and

342
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:38,661
and Marie bought his clubs just to help him
out.

343
00:21:41,297 --> 00:21:42,131
That's your story.

344
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:43,599
Well, it is at this point.

345
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:49,505
Yeah, I'll be watching.

346
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,009
All right. We'll be watching you.

347
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:01,817
Oh, no. Oh.

348
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:15,731
Well, there's no other large business, and I
call on Bob here to give us some evening's

349
00:22:15,731 --> 00:22:18,200
entertainment, I got a new kind of a new
lease on life right now.

350
00:22:22,138 --> 00:22:24,940
Well, thank you very much, Richard.

351
00:22:25,975 --> 00:22:29,211
Well, I guess I'm a man with a purpose
again.

352
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,782
No, I realized that it was those clubs.

353
00:22:33,315 --> 00:22:36,619
I mean, anyone could get a six under par
score with those clubs.

354
00:22:37,386 --> 00:22:40,923
Well, I think everybody learned a little
something tonight, and the beauty of it is

355
00:22:40,923 --> 00:22:42,758
it'll be totally lost on them by tomorrow
morning.

356
00:22:43,926 --> 00:22:45,428
I'll go back to being Bob Murray.

357
00:22:45,428 --> 00:22:46,629
I'll go back to being Murray.

358
00:22:46,662 --> 00:22:49,298
Harold, go back to me and Harold, but I'll
fix them.

359
00:22:49,465 --> 00:22:51,700
I'll go back to being me anyway.

360
00:22:52,168 --> 00:22:55,604
If my wife is watching, I'll be coming
straight home after the meeting tonight and

361
00:22:55,604 --> 00:22:58,908
Buster Hadfield is going to serenade us
outside the bedroom window with his hat.

362
00:22:59,608 --> 00:23:01,076
So be sure and have a few potted plants
ready.

363
00:23:02,478 --> 00:23:07,116
So until next time, on behalf of myself and
Harold and the whole gang up here at Possum

364
00:23:07,116 --> 00:23:08,817
Lodge. Keep your stick on the ice.

365
00:23:14,423 --> 00:23:14,857
It's right at the

366
00:23:14,857 --> 00:23:20,996
First hole I stepped up to the tee first aid,
but I hit this ball and I just felt at that

367
00:23:20,996 --> 00:23:24,099
moment that this was not going to be a
regular golf game.

368
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:29,038
So when I had the ball down there, I and I
could feel that the energy coming from the

369
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:31,574
ball going right up my club joy.

370
00:23:31,941 --> 00:23:35,411
But I pulled back because I felt like I was
even playing golf at all.

371
00:23:35,411 --> 00:23:38,614
It was more like I was, Oh, I don't know,
flying or something.

372
00:23:38,647 --> 00:23:40,783
It just seems a little bit more natural to
me.

373
00:23:41,216 --> 00:23:42,685
Anyway, that ball that just took off.

374
00:23:42,718 --> 00:23:47,189
It was hard, perfectly perpendicular to my
body part, right?
