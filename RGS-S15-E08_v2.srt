I'm sure you've all seen
these fancy lawn torches

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,307
for outdoor parties

3
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:09,776
or for when the county
shuts off your electricity

4
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:12,212
or to use as a reading lamp
when you're sleeping outside,

5
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:15,315
and your wife has given
you a Dr. Phil book.

6

But those things
cost money,

7

and they don't throw
much light.

8
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:22,255
So I'm thinking this is a
chance to do the same job

You don't even have
to empty it first

13

because the gasoline will
float on top of the water,

14
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:38,004
and the best part is
when the party's over,

15
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:40,607
the gasoline will just
burn down to the water

16
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:42,275
and put itself out.

You ever looked inside
an ice cream maker?

174

If you watch this show,
you probably have.

175

And you've noticed,
it looks exactly

like the inside
of a washing machine.

$3.75 a cone,

of tutti-frutti.

a layer of chopped ice.

Okay, I've got all the tiny
chunks of ice wrapped
around the drum.

187

that's made for "rapping."

Speaking of agitators,

189
00:08:32,277 --> 00:08:34,980
it's time to put
this one back in.

190
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,048
It's important to keep
the ice cream stirred up;

191
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:39,851
otherwise, you could end up
with all the oily fat
at the bottom,

192
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:42,354
like Moose Thompson.

193
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:44,422
Next, you add the sugar
which, again, is real cheap.

194
00:08:44,422 --> 00:08:46,791
In fact, if you're smart,

195
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,327
you can get
sugar for free.

196
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:57,736
Now you pour in whole milk

197

the milk for free...

$3.75 for
an ice cream cone.

201
00:09:08,346 --> 00:09:10,215
Again, this is pure,
fresh milk

or scrutinized,

204
00:09:14,552 --> 00:09:16,421
the fresher the better.

205
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:18,390
I would have hung a cow
over the machine,

206

the ceiling joists.

than a dash.

Now, you just
pick a flavour.

My favourite flavour
is butter pecan,

213

but I have
raspberries.

so I couldn't wash them,

pretty good.

does soak through

I'll call it
raspberry rooster.

00:14:25,262 --> 00:14:27,298
Party!
Party!

315
00:14:34,204 --> 00:14:36,206
RED: The guys came down to
the beach looking for me.

316
00:14:36,206 --> 00:14:37,541
We were all going to do
a little bit of sailing today.

317
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,876
Couldn't find me,

318
00:14:38,876 --> 00:14:40,978
I was having a
little break,

319
00:14:40,978 --> 00:14:42,980
and I had decided that we
could have a sailboat race

320
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,715
and they said,
"Let's do that."

321
00:14:44,715 --> 00:14:46,283
And I figured Mike
could be my partner

322
00:14:46,283 --> 00:14:48,385
and the other two
could work together.

323
00:14:48,385 --> 00:14:49,920
And they did that thing,

324
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,922
I'm not really
a high-fiver, myself.

325
00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:54,158
Winston had a sextant
in his pants,

326
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:56,026
I guess that's how
you pronounce it,

327
00:14:56,026 --> 00:14:58,996
a centre board
and a couple of hats.

328
00:14:58,996 --> 00:15:01,065
And I wouldn't
put that on my head,

329
00:15:01,065 --> 00:15:03,233
but I'm not his partner.

330
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:04,935
And, you know, Mike is --

331
00:15:04,935 --> 00:15:07,638
here again I don't have
a lot of the camaraderie,

332
00:15:07,638 --> 00:15:09,840
the team spirit thing.

333
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,176
So anyway, Dalton and Winston
go over to their boat,

334
00:15:12,176 --> 00:15:14,645
and they're going to get
that thing ready.

335
00:15:14,645 --> 00:15:18,282
Dalton has a balance
problem in every way.

336
00:15:18,282 --> 00:15:19,850
Mike just throws
his shoes in,

337
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:23,020
and I just kind of
pass them on.

338
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,255
So I'm thinking Mike could
just, kind of, push us off

339
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:26,623
and we're good.

340
00:15:26,623 --> 00:15:28,926
The other two had more --
wanted to do things together

341
00:15:28,926 --> 00:15:31,528
and... go get your boat.

342
00:15:31,528 --> 00:15:33,530
Meanwhile, Mike is --

343
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,965
C'mon Mike,
c'mon on.

344
00:15:34,965 --> 00:15:36,266
Go to the side

345
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:38,368
and he's working
on her pretty good there

346
00:15:38,368 --> 00:15:41,138
and meanwhile these guys
are tipping her over.

347
00:15:41,138 --> 00:15:47,377
Now, when a sailboat goes
over, the mast'll come down

348
00:15:47,377 --> 00:15:49,213
and Mike can't quite
figure out what's going on

349
00:15:49,213 --> 00:15:51,415
and then suddenly
he wasn't there anymore.

350
00:15:53,984 --> 00:15:55,886
So I thought, well to heck
with it, you know,

351
00:15:55,886 --> 00:15:57,354
he's just extra
weight anyway.

352
00:15:57,354 --> 00:15:59,756
I'll go ahead and I can
probably one-man it.

353
00:15:59,756 --> 00:16:02,226
So Dalton and Winston
get their sail all rigged

354
00:16:02,226 --> 00:16:03,994
and the race is on.

355
00:16:03,994 --> 00:16:05,762
I'm making --
I'm making headway,

356
00:16:05,762 --> 00:16:08,565
they're not really
getting anywhere.

357
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:10,567
So, I go up to the --

358
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:12,402
There's a marker buoy
at one end of the lake

359
00:16:12,402 --> 00:16:14,137
and I go around
the marker buoy

360
00:16:14,137 --> 00:16:15,806
because he was
just sitting still,

361
00:16:15,806 --> 00:16:17,574
and I come
back the other way

362
00:16:17,574 --> 00:16:19,142
and they still
haven't moved.

363
00:16:19,142 --> 00:16:20,711
They can't quite figure out
what's going --

364
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:22,279
What they're doing is they're
looking for the wind,

365
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:23,513
and they're looking down
and everything,

366
00:16:23,513 --> 00:16:25,282
but if they would just
take a moment out of
their busy day

367
00:16:25,282 --> 00:16:26,683
and look up
they'd get a sense

368
00:16:26,683 --> 00:16:30,954
of why the boat is not
catching as much air
as it should be.

369
00:16:30,954 --> 00:16:32,889
So now they've
got the problem

370
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:34,725
of how they're going
to get Mike off there.

371
00:16:34,725 --> 00:16:35,792
Winston gets an idea.

372
00:16:35,792 --> 00:16:37,995
He figures if
he tips it over

373
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:39,629
just as my boat's coming by,

374
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:41,565
they could drop Mike
right into my boat

375
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:44,601
and somehow
win the race.

376
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:46,403
So they time it
and over he goes.

377
00:16:46,403 --> 00:16:49,573
And right
through the hull.

378
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:51,641
Thank you, Mike.

379
00:16:55,145 --> 00:16:57,848
Lunch is now being served
on the poop deck.

380
00:17:04,488 --> 00:17:07,324
Last year, Bernice's mother
stayed with us for a
couple of weeks.

381
00:17:07,324 --> 00:17:09,860
Then when she left,
as a thank-you,

382
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,362
she gave us one of these
grilling machines.

383
00:17:12,362 --> 00:17:14,631
They're supposed to
help you lose weight.

384
00:17:14,631 --> 00:17:16,399
I didn't think
it would work

385
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:18,101
but then she left

386
00:17:18,101 --> 00:17:20,470
so in a way,
I lost 165 pounds

387
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,473
of unsightly fat
right then and there.

388
00:17:23,473 --> 00:17:26,209
But for the lodge I need
something with a little
more surface area

389
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:29,045
'cause the guys have
a lot more surface area.

390
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:31,915
Lucky for me the dry cleaners
down the street went
out of business

391
00:17:31,915 --> 00:17:35,018
and left this old
steam press machine behind.

392
00:17:35,018 --> 00:17:36,786
Now, I don't want
to press the clothes,

393
00:17:36,786 --> 00:17:38,588
I want to
press the flesh.

394
00:17:38,588 --> 00:17:40,857
Now, the trick to these grills
that reduce fat content,

395
00:17:40,857 --> 00:17:42,893
if that's what
you're in to,

396
00:17:42,893 --> 00:17:44,661
is for the unit
to slant forward

397
00:17:44,661 --> 00:17:46,530
so that the juices
will run off.

398
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,633
All's you got to do there
is prop the back up.

399
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:52,802
I recommend using a
vegetarian cookbook.

400
00:17:52,802 --> 00:17:55,238
It's not just
for hiding anymore.

401
00:17:56,339 --> 00:17:59,142
Okay, next you're going
to want some kind of trough

402
00:17:59,142 --> 00:18:01,845
to catch the
fat in front here.

403
00:18:01,845 --> 00:18:05,215
I suggest something with
a little more capacity
than this.

404
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:07,784
Oh, there we go.

405
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:17,594
Now, this is a grill

406
00:18:17,594 --> 00:18:19,729
and to any real man,
you can't have a grill

407
00:18:19,729 --> 00:18:22,265
without a hood ornament.

408
00:18:22,265 --> 00:18:25,635
Now, you can actually eat

actually go to waste,

00:20:55,585 --> 00:20:56,986
Everybody sit down.
Sit down.

469
00:20:56,986 --> 00:20:58,221
Grab a seat.

470
00:20:58,221 --> 00:21:00,022
Down in the back, there.

471
00:21:01,224 --> 00:21:03,493
All rise!

472
00:21:05,461 --> 00:21:07,930
Quando omni flunkus moritati.

473
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,532
RED: Sit down.

474
00:21:10,466 --> 00:21:12,535
Bow your heads
for the man's prayer.

475
00:21:12,535 --> 00:21:14,937
I'm a man,
but I can change

476
00:21:14,937 --> 00:21:16,772
if I have to...

477
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:18,708
I guess.

478
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:21,244
All right, men, Harold's stag
is a clear message

479
00:21:21,244 --> 00:21:22,612
that things
have changed.

480
00:21:22,612 --> 00:21:25,481
It's a new reality and
it's right and it's fair

481
00:21:25,481 --> 00:21:28,150
and we've all just got
to accept it.

482
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,820
But it also means that
the stags we had

483
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,955
were better than
they'll ever be again.

484
00:21:32,955 --> 00:21:35,224
[ CHEER ]

485
00:21:35,224 --> 00:21:38,060
Now, if we could only
remember them.
