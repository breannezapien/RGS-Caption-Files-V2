00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:32,091
TO GET A FUNDRAISER GOING

39
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,126

THE REPO MAN OFF OUR BACKS.

42
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:38,498
SO I THOUGHT I'D HAVE A

43
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:39,465
SUGGESTION BOX AND THE FIRST

44
00:01:39,465 --> 00:01:40,466
SUGGESTION I GOT WAS WHY DON'T

45
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:41,968
YOU MAKE THE SUGGESTION BOX

46
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:45,805
A DONATION BOX INSTEAD.

47
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:46,639
WELL THAT TURNED OUT TO BE

48
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,474
PRETTY STUPID BECAUSE WHAT THEY

49
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:49,442
DID WAS THEY STARTED DONATING

50
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:53,312
SUGGESTIONS OKAY

51
00:01:53,312 --> 00:01:53,980
AND THE MOST OF THEM

52
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,914
YOU COULD NEVER READ ON ANY

53
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:57,250

THIS WEEK ON 'HANDYMAN CORNER'

120
00:03:34,146 --> 00:03:35,481
GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO

121
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,916
MAKE A LOW COST,

122
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,217
EXTREMELY EFFICIENT,

123
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,318
LIGHTWEIGHT, ENTIRELY PORTABLE

124
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:40,953
ELECTRIC BARBECUE

125
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:42,054
WELL AT LEAST PORTABLE IN

126
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:43,155
THE SENSE THAT YOU CAN GO

127
00:03:43,155 --> 00:03:43,956
ANYWHERE THAT THEY

128
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:44,890
HAVE ELECTRICITY...

129
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,058
I GOT THE IDEA FROM ONE

130
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:47,026
OF THESE LITTLE UNITS

131
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:48,294
YOU EVER SEEN THESE BABIES?

132
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,763
THIS IS A HOT DOG COOKER

133
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:51,764
YOU GOT LIKE A NAIL CONNECTED

134
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,232
TO THE WIRE YOU PUT ONE END

135
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:54,834
IN EACH END OF THE WEENIE,

136
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:55,935
AND YOU PLUG HER INTO THE WALL

137
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,002
BY THE TIME BOB'S YOUR UNCLE

138
00:03:57,002 --> 00:03:58,070
YOU GOT YOUR WIENER BURNT

139
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,439
BLACK AND SILVER.

140
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,373
AND I'M THINKING TO MYSELF

141
00:04:01,373 --> 00:04:02,274
THIS COULD WORK ON ALMOST

142
00:04:02,274 --> 00:04:03,375
ANYTHING BECAUSE THE POINT

143
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:04,977
IS ELECTRICITY CAN COOK MEAT

144
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:06,278
WHICH ANY OF YOU KNOW WHO HAVE

145
00:04:06,278 --> 00:04:07,046
EVER STUCK YOUR FINGER

146
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,614
IN A WALL SOCKET.

147
00:04:08,614 --> 00:04:10,182
I'M THINKING YOU KNOW

148
00:04:10,182 --> 00:04:11,484
LET'S MAKE IT A LITTLE BIGGER

149
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:12,651
THAN THAT WHY CAN'T WE GET

150
00:04:12,651 --> 00:04:16,789
ELECTRICITY TO SAY COOK

151
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:17,690
A ROAST OR NOT QUITE SURE

152
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,325
WHAT THAT IS PROBABLY A RACCOON

153
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,493
I GUESS AND ALL WE'D NEED MAYBE

154
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:21,794
IS TO JUST GET A LITTLE MORE

155
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,262
POP TO THE ELECTRICITY

156
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:24,163
NOT JUST USE YOUR STANDARD

157
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,598
HOUSEHOLD CURRENT BUT MAYBE

158
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,333
HAVE A STEP UP TRANSFORMER

159
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,200
AND TAKE 'ER UP FROM

160
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,670
120 VOLTS UP TO WELL

161
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,173
HOW DOES A MILLION SOUND?

162
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:34,940
AND A TRANSFORMER IS REAL

163
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,208
EASY TO BUILD, IT'S BASICALLY

164
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,276
JUST 2 COILS OF WIRE.

165
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:38,110
SO YOU TAKE A COIL OF

166
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,745
YOUR NORMAL 14 DASH 2 HOUSEHOLD

167
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:40,813
WIRE AS WE EXPLAINED TO YOU

168
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:41,947
IN ONE OF OUR OTHER EPISODES

169
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:43,115
AND YOU DROP A SMALLER COIL

170
00:04:43,115 --> 00:04:44,283
OF WIRE INSIDE WHICH YOU

171
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:45,951
CAN GET OUT OF SAY AN OLD

172
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,319
ELECTRIC RAZOR, SOMETHING OF

173
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,420
THAT NATURE AND THESE ARE DARN

174
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,722
EASY TO COME BY ESPECIALLY

175
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:52,791
WHILE THE GUYS ARE OUT FISHING.

176
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:53,459
SO I JUST POP THE TOP

177
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,796
OFF THIS UNIT.

178
00:04:57,796 --> 00:04:58,931
ALL RIGHT NOW THIS IS A GOOD

179
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,165
SAFETY TIP, WHENEVER YOU'RE

180
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:01,533
WORKING WITH A SCREWDRIVER

181
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:03,402
SEE THE WAY I DID THAT?

182
00:05:03,402 --> 00:05:04,136
DON'T EVER PUT THE

183
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:05,070
SCREW DRIVER TOWARDS YOU.

184
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:05,804
I HOPE YOU WERE NOTICING THAT

185
00:05:05,804 --> 00:05:06,672
ESPECIALLY YOU YOUNG KIDS

186
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:08,073
OUT THERE ALWAYS HAVE

187
00:05:08,073 --> 00:05:09,008
THE SCREWDRIVER WORKING

188
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,376
AWAY FROM YOU.

189
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,310
I'LL JUST POP THE TOP

190
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,278
OFF THIS THING.

191
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:13,245
(GRUNTING)

192
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:16,181
(SIZZLE OF ELECTRICITY)

193
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:17,650
ALL RIGHT WELL I HAD

194
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,617
TO REPLACE THE FUSE THERE

195
00:05:18,617 --> 00:05:20,919
ACTUALLY IT WAS JUST A PENNY

196
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:22,521
AND IT HAD MELTED RIGHT OUT

197
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:24,023
OF THERE SO I REPLACED IT

198
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:25,157
WITH A NICKEL, SHOULD LAST

199
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:30,562
5 TIMES AS LONG.

200
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:31,330
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE

201
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,164
WHOLE COVERING OF THE RAZOR

202
00:05:32,164 --> 00:05:34,333
MELTED RIGHT OFF SO NOW

203
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,336
I CAN JUST LOWER THAT RIGHT

204
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,805
INSIDE MY OUTER COIL AND WHEN

205
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:41,373
I PLUG THIS END IN WE'RE GOING

206
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:42,307
TO GET THE MILLION VOLTS

207
00:05:42,307 --> 00:05:44,043
COMING RIGHT OUT HERE.

208
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,544
NOW WHAT I HAVE TO DO IS USE

209
00:05:45,544 --> 00:05:46,879
SOMETHING AS AN ELECTRODE

210
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,980
FOR THE THING SOMETHING

211
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,914

212
00:05:48,914 --> 00:05:49,681

00:05:58,724 --> 00:06:02,761
THE WOOD KIND BECAUSE THE

219
00:06:02,761 --> 00:06:03,929
WOOD DOESN'T REALLY CONDUCT

220
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:05,197
ELECTRICITY ALL THAT WELL

221
00:06:05,197 --> 00:06:05,898

00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:51,989
SOFTER THAN, WHAT IS THAT?

543
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:52,990
APPARENTLY BILL KEEPS HIS

544
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,426
GROUND SHEET IN HIS COVERALLS

545
00:14:55,426 --> 00:15:02,032
WELL I DON'T EVEN WANT TO THINK

546
00:15:02,032 --> 00:15:03,634
ABOUT THIS BUT WE HAD TO GET

547
00:15:03,634 --> 00:15:05,636

548
00:15:05,636 --> 00:15:09,139
SPREAD OUT, BOY OH BOY

549
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:10,207
ANYWAY YOU GET THAT SPREAD OUT

550
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:11,508
OVER THE BITS OF BRUSH AND

551
00:15:11,508 --> 00:15:12,876
EVERYTHING KEEP THE LEAVES

552
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:14,211
AWAY FROM YOU.

553
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:15,579
THE NEXT UNIT YOU NEED THERE

554
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:17,714
WAS THE SLEEPING BAG

555
00:15:17,714 --> 00:15:21,652
THE COVER YOU JUST THROW OH!

556
00:15:21,652 --> 00:15:22,753

557
00:15:22,753 --> 00:15:24,455
OH WELL SO BILL'S GOING

558
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:25,823
TO UNROLL HIS SLEEPING BAG

559
00:15:25,823 --> 00:15:26,757
BUT THIS THING HAD BEEN

560
00:15:26,757 --> 00:15:27,724
ROLLED UP SO LONG SHE HAD

561
00:15:27,724 --> 00:15:31,862
A LOT OF TENSION BUILT UP

562
00:15:31,862 --> 00:15:32,930
THAT'S VERY STRANGE ISN'T IT?

563
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,198
WELL IT TURNS OUT IT WASN'T

564
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:35,332

565
00:15:35,332 --> 00:15:37,868

567
00:15:39,136 --> 00:15:40,838
A ROCK INSIDE THE BAG

568
00:15:40,838 --> 00:15:42,139
WE DON'T NEED THAT NEAR OUR BED

569
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:43,874

SAY TO YOU THEY DON'T MAKE

674
00:18:56,065 --> 00:18:57,834
MOVIES LIKE THEY USED TO

675
00:18:57,834 --> 00:19:00,837
DON'T BE UPSET ABOUT THAT.

676
00:19:01,704 --> 00:19:02,672
>>RED: I THOUGHT IT WOULD

677
00:19:02,672 --> 00:19:03,440
REALLY HELP OUR CASINO NIGHT

678
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,374
IF I INVITED RANGER GORD NOT

679
00:19:04,374 --> 00:19:05,875
THAT WE WANTED HIM THERE SO

680
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:06,910
MUCH BUT WITH HIS LIFESTYLE

681
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:07,911
I FIGURE HE'S GOT A LOT

682
00:19:07,911 --> 00:19:11,948
OF DISPOSABLE INCOME.

683
00:19:11,948 --> 00:19:13,183
>>GORD: OH MR. GREEN

684
00:19:13,183 --> 00:19:13,983

>>RED: ALL RIGHT.

689
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:20,523
>>GORD: LISTEN WOULD YOU MIND

690
00:19:20,523 --> 00:19:21,324
TAKING THIS DOWN WITH YOU

692
00:19:23,293 --> 00:19:24,160
>>RED: YEAH I CAN DO THAT,

693
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,928

694
00:19:24,928 --> 00:19:28,932
>>GORD: GREAT GREAT AND THEY'RE

695
00:19:28,932 --> 00:19:29,832
SUPPOSED TO COME BY EVERY

696
00:19:29,832 --> 00:19:30,633
FRIDAY BUT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN

697
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:31,801
AROUND IN A WHILE

698
00:19:31,801 --> 00:19:33,336
DON'T KNOW WHY.

699
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:34,237
>>RED: I'LL TAKE CARE

700
00:19:34,237 --> 00:19:35,205
OF THAT FOR YOU.

701
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:36,172
>>GORD: THANKS.

702
00:19:36,172 --> 00:19:36,940
HEY SOMETHING REALLY

703
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,641
DIFFERENT ABOUT YOU TODAY.

704
00:19:38,641 --> 00:19:40,343
>>RED: YEAH IT'S MY SHIRT.

705
00:19:40,343 --> 00:19:41,344
>>GORD: NO, NO, SOMETHING ELSE

706
00:19:41,344 --> 00:19:42,245
YOU'VE GAINED A LOT OF WEIGHT

707
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:43,279
AND GOTTEN ALL GREY

708
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:45,615
OR SOMETHING.

709
00:19:45,615 --> 00:19:46,416
>>RED: NO IT'S JUST MY SHIRT

710
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,183
THAT'S THE ONLY THING

711
00:19:47,183 --> 00:19:48,885
THAT'S CHANGED ABOUT ME.

712
00:19:48,885 --> 00:19:50,019
YOU SEEM PRETTY WELL

713
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:51,921
THE SAME THOUGH GORD.

714
00:19:51,921 --> 00:19:53,056
>>GORD: YEAH YEAH WELL

715
00:19:53,056 --> 00:19:53,823
THAT'S WHAT THIS JOB DEMANDS

716
00:19:53,823 --> 00:19:55,592
BEING THE SAME MAN EVERYDAY

717
00:19:55,592 --> 00:19:57,226
LOOKING OUT OVER THE SAME FOREST

718
00:19:57,226 --> 00:20:02,131
SAMENESS SAME, SAME, SAME

719
00:20:02,131 --> 00:20:04,067
YEAH STARING AT THE SAME SUN,

720
00:20:04,067 --> 00:20:05,601
LOOKING AT THE SAME CLOUDS,

721
00:20:05,601 --> 00:20:07,303
TALKING TO THEM.

722
00:20:07,303 --> 00:20:08,371
THEY CHANGE, THEY CHANGE

723
00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:10,206
THAT'S TRUE, THANK GOODNESS

724
00:20:10,206 --> 00:20:11,341
FOR THE CLOUDS A GUY COULD

725
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:13,509
GET LONELY BUT I KNOW H.Q. IS

726
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:14,811
COUNTING ON ME SO I'M NOT GOING

727
00:20:14,811 --> 00:20:16,579
TO LET THEM DOWN OH DID YOU

728
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:17,947
CHECK MY MAILBOX ON THE WAY UP?

729
00:20:17,947 --> 00:20:19,549
>>RED: YEAH, THERE'S NOTHING

730
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:24,687
THERE, NO.

731
00:20:24,687 --> 00:20:25,355
>>GORD: THAT'S OKAY.

732
00:20:25,355 --> 00:20:26,289
YOU KNOW THEY USED TO SEND

733
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:27,290
A PAYCHEQUE EVERY COUPLE

734
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,591
OF MONTHS BUT I KNOW HOW

735
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:33,029
HECTIC OFFICE WORK CAN GET.

736
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:34,597
NO PROBLEM IT'S NOT LIKE I

737
00:20:34,597 --> 00:20:36,299
CAN SPEND IT ON ANYTHING ANYWAY.

738
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:38,568
>>RED: WELL NOW ACTUALLY IT'S

739
00:20:38,568 --> 00:20:39,602
INTERESTING THAT YOU SHOULD SAY

740
00:20:39,602 --> 00:20:40,737
THAT BECAUSE I WAS JUST HERE

741
00:20:40,737 --> 00:20:41,504
TO INVITE YOU TO COME DOWN

742
00:20:41,504 --> 00:20:42,271
TO THE LODGE TONIGHT FOR

743
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:46,242
CASINO NIGHT.

744
00:20:46,242 --> 00:20:47,276
>>GORD: NO, NO.

745
00:20:47,276 --> 00:20:47,977
>>RED: OH SURE COME ON.

746
00:20:47,977 --> 00:20:48,945
>>GORD: NO, NO, I COULDN'T

747
00:20:48,945 --> 00:20:49,746
I MEAN WHO'S GOING TO LOOK

748
00:20:49,746 --> 00:20:51,514
AFTER THE FOREST HUH?

749
00:20:51,514 --> 00:20:53,116
I MEAN PEOPLE ARE COUNTING ON ME

750
00:20:53,116 --> 00:20:54,283
TO PROTECT THEM AND NOT JUST

751
00:20:54,283 --> 00:20:55,051
WHEN IT'S CONVENIENT OR WHEN

752
00:20:55,051 --> 00:20:56,385
IT CO ORDINATES WITH MY

753
00:20:56,385 --> 00:21:01,524
SOCIAL CALENDAR.

754
00:21:01,524 --> 00:21:03,292
NO THANK YOU, PLUS THE FACT

755
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:05,194
THAT H.Q. HAS NEVER SENT

756
00:21:05,194 --> 00:21:06,662
AN INSPECTOR TO VISIT ME IN

757
00:21:06,662 --> 00:21:07,497
THE 16 YEARS I'VE BEEN

758
00:21:07,497 --> 00:21:09,632
A FOREST RANGER

759
00:21:09,632 --> 00:21:12,602
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?

760
00:21:12,602 --> 00:21:13,436
>>RED: THAT THEY

761
00:21:13,436 --> 00:21:18,841
FORGOT ABOUT YOU?

762
00:21:18,841 --> 00:21:19,475
>>GORD: NO THAT

763
00:21:19,475 --> 00:21:20,443
I'M DUE, OVERDUE.

764
00:21:20,443 --> 00:21:21,177
>>RED: OH ALL RIGHT.

765
00:21:21,177 --> 00:21:21,878
>>GORD: TONIGHT

766
00:21:21,878 --> 00:21:22,745
COULD BE THE NIGHT.

767
00:21:22,745 --> 00:21:23,513
>>RED: ALL RIGHT.

768
00:21:23,513 --> 00:21:24,347
>>GORD: TONIGHT.

769
00:21:24,347 --> 00:21:25,147
>>RED: ALL RIGHT.

770
00:21:25,147 --> 00:21:25,882
>>GORD: YEAH BUT THANKS ANYWAY

771
00:21:25,882 --> 00:21:26,716
COME BY AND VISIT AFTER

772
00:21:26,716 --> 00:21:27,483
I'M UP ALL NIGHT.

773
00:21:27,483 --> 00:21:28,384
>>RED: WELL I CAN ONLY MAKE

774
00:21:28,384 --> 00:21:29,585
SUGGESTIONS TO THE FELLAS

775
00:21:29,585 --> 00:21:31,354
I DON'T KNOW THEY GO...

776
00:21:31,354 --> 00:21:32,455
>>GORD: GREAT BE FUN THEN

777
00:21:32,455 --> 00:21:34,257
SEE YOU LATER, I CAN MAKE

778
00:21:34,257 --> 00:21:36,692
LITTLE SNACKS ON TOAST.

779
00:21:36,692 --> 00:21:37,693
>>RED: OH DON'T MAKE ANYTHING

780
00:21:37,693 --> 00:21:38,427
UNTIL WE GET HERE GORD.

781
00:21:38,427 --> 00:21:39,262
>>GORD: OH NO PROBLEM

782
00:21:39,262 --> 00:21:40,029
WHAT TIME EXACTLY?

783
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:41,130
>>RED: NOT BEFORE MIDNIGHT

784
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,665
I WOULDN'T THINK.

785
00:21:42,665 --> 00:21:43,366
>>GORD: NO PROBLEM, NO PROBLEM

786
00:21:43,366 --> 00:21:46,402
UP ALL NIGHT, ALL NIGHT.

787
00:21:49,205 --> 00:21:50,840
>>RED: WELL THE CASINO NIGHT...

788
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:56,679
(HAROLD CHUCKLING)

789
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:57,747
>>RED: YOU'RE A BORN

790
00:21:57,747 --> 00:21:59,682
LEADER HAROLD.

791
00:21:59,682 --> 00:22:01,217
CASINO NIGHT IS A DEFINITE GO

792
00:22:01,217 --> 00:22:02,051
ALTHOUGH WE ALMOST HAD TO

793
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:03,219
CANCEL AT THE LAST MINUTE

794
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:04,253
BECAUSE STINKY PETERSON

795
00:22:04,253 --> 00:22:05,321
MISUNDERSTOOD THE TERM

796
00:22:05,321 --> 00:22:09,759
CRAPS TABLE.

797
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:10,559
DO YOU HAVE TO CHANGE WHERE

798
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,361
I CAN SEE YOU HAROLD?

799
00:22:12,361 --> 00:22:16,932
I'LL NEVER EAT CHICKEN AGAIN.

800
00:22:16,932 --> 00:22:17,666
ANYWAY THE WEATHER'S REAL GOOD

801
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:18,401
SO WE DECIDED TO MOVE THE

802
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:19,735
CASINO NIGHT OUTDOORS

803
00:22:19,735 --> 00:22:21,103
WE GOT A ROULETTE WHEEL,

804
00:22:21,103 --> 00:22:21,904
A ONE-ARMED BANDIT

805
00:22:21,904 --> 00:22:24,507
AND A ONE-LEGGED BARTENDER

806
00:22:24,507 --> 00:22:25,741
THREW ALL THE BEER INTO THE LAKE

807
00:22:25,741 --> 00:22:28,911
OR AS WE CALL IT OUR WET BAR

808
00:22:28,911 --> 00:22:30,112
ALL WE NEED NOW IS ORGANIZED

809
00:22:30,112 --> 00:22:30,946
CRIME IT'D BE JUST

810
00:22:30,946 --> 00:22:37,019
LIKE LAS VEGAS.

811
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:38,554
(POSSUM SQUEALING)

812
00:22:38,554 --> 00:22:39,722
>>HAROLD: OH IT'S

813
00:22:39,722 --> 00:22:41,123
THE SOUND OF THE POSSUM

814
00:22:41,123 --> 00:22:41,824
WE GOT TO LEAVE NOW.

815
00:22:41,824 --> 00:22:42,458
>>RED: YEAH WELL YOU GO AHEAD

816
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:43,826
HAROLD I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

817
00:22:43,826 --> 00:22:44,860
>>HAROLD: I LOOK LIKE YOU NOW.

818
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,494
>>RED: YEAH YEAH YOU

819
00:22:45,494 --> 00:22:47,997
LOOK TERRIFIC.

820
00:22:47,997 --> 00:22:51,267
IT'S A SHAME ISN'T IT?

821
00:22:51,267 --> 00:22:52,034
ANYWAY WE'LL GET THE MEETING

822
00:22:52,034 --> 00:22:53,302
WRAPPED UP IN A HURRY SO WE

823
00:22:53,302 --> 00:22:54,670
CAN GET OUT THERE AND START

824
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,971
LOSING MONEY WHICH I SUPPOSE

825
00:22:55,971 --> 00:22:58,307
IS THE FUN OF GAMBLING

826
00:22:58,307 --> 00:22:59,375
THE ART OF THE DEAL

827
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:00,276
AS DONALD TRUMP WOULD SAY

828
00:23:00,276 --> 00:23:01,377
ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK THERE

829
00:23:01,377 --> 00:23:02,578
IS ANY TRUMP IN POKER

830
00:23:02,578 --> 00:23:03,345
AND YET HE OWNS A COUPLE

831
00:23:03,345 --> 00:23:06,749
OF CASINOS SO GO FIGURE.

832
00:23:06,749 --> 00:23:07,616
ANYWAY IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING

833
00:23:07,616 --> 00:23:08,784
THAT BLEACH YOU GAVE ME

834
00:23:08,784 --> 00:23:09,785
TOOK THE RELISH STAINS

835
00:23:09,785 --> 00:23:10,586
RIGHT OUT OF THE SHIRT AND

836
00:23:10,586 --> 00:23:11,887
DIDN'T HARM THE FLANNEL AT ALL

837
00:23:11,887 --> 00:23:14,089
SO EVERYBODY ELSE ON BEHALF OF

838
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:15,024
MYSELF AND HAROLD AND THE WHOLE

839
00:23:15,024 --> 00:23:16,325
GANG UP HERE AT POSSUM LODGE

840
