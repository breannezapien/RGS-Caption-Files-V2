00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,271
MEN HAVE MADE SOME PRETTY
IMPORTANT STATEMENTS...

2
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:07,207
GIVE ME LIBERTY OR
GIVE ME DEATH.

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:10,076
I REGRET THAT I HAVE ONE
LIFE TO GIVE FOR MY COUNTRY.

4
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:13,413
AND THE MOST FAMOUS,
NOBODY TOUCHES MY STUFF.

5
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:15,548
SEE, MEN ARE
TERRITORIAL BY NATURE,

6
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:17,584
AND OF ALL THE THINGS
IN THE NATURAL WORLD

7
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:19,586
THAT A MAN WILL
FIGHT TO HOLD ONTO,

8
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:23,089
NOTHING IS MORE SACRED
THAN THE T.V. REMOTE.

9
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,824
WE'RE WATCHING T.V.,

10
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:27,560
WE HOLD ON TO THIS THING LIKE
A FAT KID WITH A CORN DOG.

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,896
EVERY NOW AND THEN YOU NEED
TO HAVE BOTH HANDS FREE.

12
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:31,798
LIKE WHEN YOU WANT
TO PICK UP YOUR BEVERAGE

13
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:34,501
AND THE SNACK BOWL
AT THE SAME TIME.

14
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,036
AND IN THAT SPLIT SECOND,
YOUR WIFE STEALS THE REMOTE

15
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:40,306
AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE WATCHING DR. PHIL.

16
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:42,408
THIS IS A GOOD
TIME TO REMEMBER

17
00:00:42,408 --> 00:00:44,677
THE SECOND LAW OF
MARITAL DYNAMICS...

18
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:47,480
SHE WON'T STEAL WHAT
SHE CAN'T USE.

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,650
SEE, THIS REMOTE DOESN'T
HAVE ANY BATTERIES
IN IT AT ALL.

20
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,720
THEY'RE DUCT TAPED
TO MY WRIST HERE,

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,255
AND YOU SEE THESE WIRES.

22
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,757
THEY'RE CONNECTED TO THE RINGS
THAT I HAVE ON MY FINGERS,

23
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:01,528
WHICH JUST HAPPEN TO LINE UP
ON THE CONTACTS ON THE BACK
OF THE REMOTE.

24
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:02,962
HAPPY FLIPPING.

25
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:09,168

REMEMBER WHICH FINGER
THE WEDDING RING GOES ON.

THANK YOU. APPRECIATE IT.

29

SORRY I'M A LITTLE BIT LATE.

WE WERE TRYING
TO LAUNCH MY NEW BOAT.

BOY, SHE'S A BEAUTY.
CLASSIC, WOODEN HULL.

32
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,864
GOT A LITTLE
BIT OF ROT IN HER,

33
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:40,566
BUT IT WAS ONLY 30 BUCKS
INCLUDING THE AIR FRESHENERS.

34
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:42,335
THE PROBLEM IS THE
DARN BOAT RAMP.

35
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:44,337
WE'VE GOT SO MANY
SUNKEN BOATS,

36
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,072
TOW VEHICLES AND
SNOWMOBILES IN THERE

37
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:48,808

TRAILER THROUGH THE SHIPWRECKS.

THIS IS NOT FUNNY.

HAROLD, I TOLD YOU
TO STAY IN THE BOAT.

41
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:07,293
IT SANK TO THE BOTTOM!

42
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:10,396
YOU SAID THAT WOULDN'T
HAPPEN AGAIN.

43
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:12,165
IT'S THE DARN
BOAT RAMP, HAROLD.

44
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,066
THERE'S SO MUCH
SUNKEN CRAP IN THERE.

45
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:15,601
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

46
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:17,303
WELL, CALL THE PEOPLE
THAT LEFT ALL THEIR
STUFF IN THERE

47
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,838
TO GET THEM TO
HAUL IT OUT.

48
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,440
PEOPLE CAN'T BE
BOTHERED DOING THAT.

49
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,808
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

50
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,310
BECAUSE IT'S MY
STUFF AND I CAN'T
BE BOTHERED DOING THAT.

51
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,479
SEE, ALL WE GOT TO DO IS
BUILD A NEW BOAT RAMP

52
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,347
OVER THE
OLD BOAT RAMP.

53
00:02:28,347 --> 00:02:30,683
OH, WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
BUILDING BOAT RAMPS?

54
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,485
OH HAROLD, IT'S
PRETTY DARN SIMPLE.

55
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,287
IT'S LIKE GRAVITY,
LIKE BEING A PLUMBER.

56
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,522
ALL YOU GOT TO REMEMBER
IS THAT WATER GOES
DOWNHILL

57
00:02:36,522 --> 00:02:38,758
AND PAYDAY'S FRIDAY.

58

NO, IT'S NOT
LIKE PLUMBING.
IT'S ENGINEERING.

PLEASE, DO ME A FAVOUR.
PLEASE!

60
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,965
JUST BUILD A SCALE MODEL
OF THE BOAT RAMP FIRST.

61
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,700
OH, HAROLD.

62
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,435
YEAH, BECAUSE IF
IT WORKS IN MINIATURE,

63
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,437
IT WILL WORK IN
NORMAL SIZE.

ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

65

ABOUT THE PLAN THAT
I COME UP WITH

66
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,143
AND SEE IF IT MAKES
SENSE IN YOUR MIND.

I WILL BE HAPPY
TO DO THAT.

68

IT WORKS IN MINIATURE,
IT'LL WORK IN NORMAL SIZE.

ANY CHANCE YOU'LL EVER
WAKE UP, HAROLD?

YOU KNOW,
I REMEMBER NOW.

133
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:59,992
ONCE I WAS WITH PAM STUBBS
IN PORT ASBESTOS, YOU KNOW.

134
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:02,661
AND THERE WE WERE ALL
ALONE IN HER OFFICE.

135
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:05,230
SHE REACHES OVER
AND SHE CLOSES THE DOOR.

136
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:09,668
SHE STARTS ASKING
ME A WHOLE BUNCH OF
PERSONAL QUESTIONS.

137
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:11,637
SHE REACHES OVER,

138
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:15,574
SHE STARTS
TOUCHING MY KNEE.

139

SHE'S AN ARTHRITIS
SPECIALIST, DALTON.

140

OKAY. WELL, OKAY.

00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:23,081

ARE INTERESTED IN YOU.

WELL, AS A MATTER
OF FACT I DO.

143
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:26,185
YES, I DO.
IN FACT I DO.

144
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,587
AND THE OTHER DAY, I HEARD
OLD MAN SEDGWICK'S DAUGHTER

145
00:06:28,587 --> 00:06:31,690
TELL HAROLD THAT SHE REALLY
LIKES MY FURRY BEARD.

146
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,660
SHE DIDN'T SAY SHE
LIKES YOUR FURRY BEARD.

147
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,896
NO, SHE SAID SHE THOUGHT
YOU WERE VERY WEIRD.

SOMEONE HERE WITH SOME
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE,

WELL, MY ADVICE
TO THIS VIEWER

152
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:53,512
IS THAT YOU SIMPLY TAKE
THIS PERSON ASIDE,
IN PRIVATE,

153
00:06:53,512 --> 00:06:56,448
AND SAY, ALTHOUGH SOMEONE AS
WONDERFUL AS THEM IS
VERY TEMPTING,

154
00:06:56,448 --> 00:06:58,750
IT SIMPLY CANNOT BE.

155
00:07:01,553 --> 00:07:03,322
ACTUALLY,
THAT'S NOT BAD.

156
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,257
YEAH, BUT WHAT
IF IT DOESN'T WORK?

157
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:06,792
OH, THEN YOU GOT
TO BE FIRMER.

158
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:09,127
YEAH, YOU JUST SAY,
OKAY, I'M NOT INTERESTED

159
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:10,696
AND I NEVER COULD BE.

160
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,597
YOU KNOW, AND YOU GOT TO
STOP HANGING OUT IN
FRONT OF MY HOUSE,

161
00:07:12,597 --> 00:07:14,232
AND YOU GOT TO STOP TELLING
YOUR FRIENDS THAT YOU'RE
GOING OUT WITH ME,

162
00:07:14,232 --> 00:07:18,003
AND IF YOU DON'T I'M GOING
TO CALL THE POLICE ON YOU,
HAROLD GREEN.

163
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:21,707
[ APPLAUSE ]

164
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:28,380
YOU KNOW, YOU TRY YOUR
BEST TO SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT.

165
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,782
SWITCH TO AN
ELECTRIC LAWN MOWER,

166
00:07:30,782 --> 00:07:32,517
WHERE DOES IT GET YOU?

167
00:07:32,517 --> 00:07:36,455
BACK TO THE HARDWARE STORE
FOR ANOTHER 100 FEET OF
EXTENSION CORD.

168
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:38,557
DON'T WORRY, AS USUAL,

169
00:07:38,557 --> 00:07:40,592
I'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA.

170
00:07:40,592 --> 00:07:43,128
FIRST THING WE HAVE TO
DO IS TAKE DOWN THIS
CHAIN LINK FENCE.

171
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,338
I'M SURE SOME OF YOU
HAVE SEEN STREETCARS,

172
00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:55,740
AND IF YOU'RE NOT
FAMILIAR WITH STREETCARS,

173
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,709
I'M SURE YOU'RE
DRIVEN BUMPER CARS,

174
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:59,711
AND IF YOU'RE NOT
FAMILIAR WITH BUMPER CARS,

175
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:01,713
YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT
WATCHING THIS SHOW.

176
00:08:01,713 --> 00:08:03,548
WE'RE GOING TO USE
THAT SAME TECHNOLOGY

177
00:08:03,548 --> 00:08:05,450
TO MAKE OUR MODIFIED
ELECTRIC LAWN MOWER HERE.

178
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,919
SEE, YOU'VE GOT TWO WIRES
COMING OFF THE ELECTRIC MOTOR.

179
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,255
I ATTACH ONE OF THEM TO
THE FRAME OF THE MOWER,

180
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:13,225
AND THE OTHER ONE I ATTACH TO
THIS FENCE POST HERE.

181
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:15,160
SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE
ALREADY NOTICED

182
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,729
THAT I'VE REPLACED THE STANDARD
ISSUE RUBBER LAWN MOWER TIRES

183
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:19,831
WITH THESE
CLOTHESLINE PULLEYS

184
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:22,667
BECAUSE THEY'RE METAL AND
THEY CONDUCT ELECTRICITY.

185
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:25,270
NOT THAT YOU NEED TO BE METAL
TO CONDUCT ELECTRICITY,

186
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,739
AS OLD MAN
SEDGWICK FOUND OUT

187
00:08:27,739 --> 00:08:30,675
WHEN HE RELIEVED HIMSELF
ONTO A POWER TRANSFORMER.

188
00:08:30,675 --> 00:08:33,678
OKAY, THE ONLY OTHER
MODIFICATION WE NEED HERE

189
00:08:33,678 --> 00:08:37,148
IS TO MAKE A SOFTER CONTACT
POINT FOR MY FENCE POST.

190
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:43,888
DONE.

191
00:08:47,158 --> 00:08:49,461
OKAY, SO INSTEAD OF
HOOKING THE LAWN MOWER UP

192
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:51,663
DIRECT WITH AN EXTENSION CORD,

193
00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:53,732
WHICH I'VE RUN OVER FOR
THE THIRD TIME THIS MONTH,

194
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:56,234
ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT
THE WARRANTY COVERS
THEIR MISTAKES,

195
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:57,969
NOT MINE,

196
00:08:57,969 --> 00:09:00,639
I'VE GOT A DIFFERENT WAY
TO HOOK UP THE ELECTRICITY.

197
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,540
TOOK ONE WIRE,

198
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,643
ATTACHED IT TO THIS SPIKE
I'VE GOT IN THE GROUND, SEE,

199
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:06,544
AND THAT CONNECTS TO THE METAL
WHEELS ON THE LAWN MOWER.

200
00:09:06,544 --> 00:09:09,881
AND THEN THE OTHER WIRE
I ATTACHED TO THIS
ELECTRIC GRID

201
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:11,950
THAT I'VE MADE OUT OF
THE CHAIN LINK FENCE.

202
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,019
ONCE THE LEAF RAKE CONNECTS
TO THAT, YOU SEE,

203
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:16,988
THAT CLOSES THE CIRCUIT,
MAKES THE LAWN MOWER GO.

204
00:09:16,988 --> 00:09:18,857
ISN'T THAT A LOT SAFER

205
00:09:18,857 --> 00:09:21,226
THAN LUGGING AROUND A
DANGEROUS EXTENSION CORD?

206
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:23,528
SO REMEMBER, IF THE
WOMEN DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

207
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:26,431
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

208
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,701
AND NOW,
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

209
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:32,070
I'VE GOT TO SAVE
THE ENVIRONMENT.

210
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:51,923
I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU OLDER GUYS

211
00:09:51,923 --> 00:09:53,892
ABOUT YOUR GOOD LOOKS --

212
00:09:53,892 --> 00:09:56,094
OR MORE SPECIFICALLY,
WHERE THEY WENT.

213
00:09:56,094 --> 00:09:59,464
NOW, YOU MAY THINK THAT YOUR
HANDSOME, YOUTHFUL BODY
IS BEHIND YOU,

214
00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:03,501
BUT THE PEOPLE STANDING BACK
THERE MAY NOT NECESSARILY
AGREE WITH YOU.

215
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:06,404
YOU LOOK BAD,
BUT HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS...

216
00:10:06,404 --> 00:10:10,141
YOU LOOK WAY BETTER
THAN YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK.

217
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:13,778
UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU START
EATING RIGHT AND EXERCISING.

218
00:10:13,778 --> 00:10:15,947
YEAH!

219
00:10:17,182 --> 00:10:19,284
OKAY, SURE, I'M SUPPOSE
YOU COULD START WEARING

220
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:21,519
MAKEUP AND A GIRDLE AND HAVE
SOME COSMETIC SURGERY,

221
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,154
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

222
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:26,057
THAT'S FOR GUYS WHO BAKE PIES
AND MAKE THEIR OWN CURTAINS.

223
00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:28,059
I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

224
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:29,861
AS YOUR LOOKS
START SLIPPING,

225
00:10:29,861 --> 00:10:32,630
SO SHOULD YOUR STANDARDS.

226
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,365
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK GOOD.

227
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:37,168
YOU JUST HAVE
TO LOOK GOOD ENOUGH.

228
00:10:37,168 --> 00:10:40,505
DON'T GET A FACELIFT.
JUST SIT NEAR A BASSET HOUND.

229
00:10:40,505 --> 00:10:42,607
YOU'LL LOOK FINE.

230
00:10:42,607 --> 00:10:45,543
DON'T MAKE
ANY EFFORT AT ALL.

231
00:10:45,543 --> 00:10:49,080
SEE, APATHY IS THE KEY TO
A YOUTHFUL APPEARANCE.

232
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,149
I MEAN, TEENAGERS DON'T
CARE ABOUT ANYTHING.

233
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:53,584
SEE HOW YOUNG THEY LOOK?

234
00:10:53,584 --> 00:10:55,787
AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT PEOPLE
SAYING YOU LET YOURSELF GO.

235
00:10:55,787 --> 00:10:59,223
THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN SAYING
THAT ABOUT YOU FOR 10 YEARS.

236
00:10:59,223 --> 00:11:01,092
REMEMBER,
I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

237
00:11:01,092 --> 00:11:03,461
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

238
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:09,400
I GUESS I'M JUST LUCKY.

239
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,704
WELL, SOME PEOPLE GO THROUGH
THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

240
00:11:12,704 --> 00:11:14,872
WITHOUT EVER REALLY KNOWING
THEIR TRUE PURPOSE.

241
00:11:14,872 --> 00:11:17,675
BUT FOR ME EVER SINCE
I WAS A YOUNG BOY,

242
00:11:17,675 --> 00:11:23,514
I'VE KNOWN THAT I WAS PUT ON
THIS EARTH TO SUCK SEWAGE.

243
00:11:23,514 --> 00:11:27,718
OH, SURE, YEAH, THE KIDS
USED TO TEASE ME A BIT.

244
00:11:27,718 --> 00:11:31,322
THEY'D SAY, WINSTON
LIKES TO SUCK SEWAGE

245
00:11:31,322 --> 00:11:34,959
OR, THERE GOES WINSTON
THE SEWAGE SUCKER.

246
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,828
OR I ALSO REMEMBER
THEM SAYING,

247
00:11:36,828 --> 00:11:39,130
HEY, WINSTON, WHY DON'T
YOU GO SUCK SOME SEWAGE?

248
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,932
YOU KNOW,
THAT TYPE OF THING.

249
00:11:40,932 --> 00:11:43,568
BUT WHERE ARE
THOSE KIDS NOW?

250
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:46,037
OKAY, WELL, ACTUALLY,

251
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:48,105
A LOT OF THEM HAVE DONE
PRETTY WELL FOR THEMSELVES,

252
00:11:48,105 --> 00:11:49,974
BUT THAT'S NOT
THE POINT, RIGHT?

253
00:11:49,974 --> 00:11:51,943
YEAH, YEAH.

254
00:11:51,943 --> 00:11:53,911
I THINK WHEN FOLKS CALL ME

255
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:56,914
THEY KNOW THEY'RE
GETTING A REAL PERSON.

256
00:11:56,914 --> 00:11:59,283
YEAH, SURE, YOU COULD CALL

257
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:02,320
ONE OF THOSE BIG,
FACELESS MULTINATIONAL

258
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,121
SEWAGE SUCKING COMPANIES,

259
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:06,257
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT ALWAYS ABOUT

260
00:12:06,257 --> 00:12:08,125
WHO HAS THE
BIGGEST TRUCK, RIGHT?

261
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:11,195
IT'S ABOUT --
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE,

262
00:12:11,195 --> 00:12:14,632
PEOPLE WITH, UH,
SEPTIC TANKS.

263
00:12:14,632 --> 00:12:16,734
IF YOU'RE HAVING A PROBLEM,

264
00:12:16,734 --> 00:12:19,537
CALL ME.
WE'LL TALK.

265
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:22,406
I'M HERE TO
LIGHTEN YOUR LOAD.

266
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,783
[ APPLAUSE ]

267
00:12:34,852 --> 00:12:36,654
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
ABOUT A MIDDLE-AGED GUY

268
00:12:36,654 --> 00:12:39,757
AND THE SOUND
OF RUNNING WATER.

269
00:12:39,757 --> 00:12:41,158
IF I WAS DEAF,

270
00:12:41,158 --> 00:12:44,128
I WOULD'VE HAD
THIS DONE AN HOUR AGO.

271
00:12:44,128 --> 00:12:46,163
UNCLE RED, HERE'S THE
BOARD THAT YOU WANTED.

272
00:12:46,163 --> 00:12:47,898
NO, NO, NO.
IT'S NOT A BOARD.

273
00:12:47,898 --> 00:12:51,268
THAT'S MY MODEL
BOAT RAMP.

274
00:12:51,268 --> 00:12:52,837
SEE, I'M DOING WHAT
YOU SAID, HAROLD.

275
00:12:52,837 --> 00:12:54,572
I'M BUILDING THE WHOLE
THING IN MINIATURE,

276
00:12:54,572 --> 00:12:57,208
SEE, 'CAUSE ARGUING IS
JUST A WASTE OF TIME
AND ENERGY.

277
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,443
NOW, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A MATURE MAN.

278
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:02,013
NO, IT SOUNDS LIKE A
MARRIED MAN, HAROLD.

279
00:13:02,013 --> 00:13:03,948
NOW YOU SEE
THIS TUB HERE?

280
00:13:03,948 --> 00:13:05,583
THAT REPRESENTS
POSSUM LAKE.

281
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,853
WELL, THAT CAN'T BE.
THIS IS WATER.

282
00:13:08,853 --> 00:13:10,788
AND YOU SEE ALL
THIS SCRAP HERE?

283
00:13:10,788 --> 00:13:13,057
THAT REPRESENTS THE VARIOUS
BOATS AND TOWING VEHICLES

284
00:13:13,057 --> 00:13:14,992
THAT HAVE COME TO
AN UNTIMELY DEMISE

285
00:13:14,992 --> 00:13:17,027
DURING THE
LAUNCHING PROCESS.

286
00:13:17,027 --> 00:13:18,696
NOW, IS THIS TO SCALE?

287
00:13:18,696 --> 00:13:21,565
IT'S A LITTLE LOW,
BUT I RAN OUT OF
BROKEN TOYS.

288
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:23,434
AND NOW, OF COURSE,
WHAT WE HAVE HERE

289
00:13:23,434 --> 00:13:25,002
IS THE TOW VEHICLE,

290
00:13:25,002 --> 00:13:27,004
AND WE GOT THE BOAT
THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY
TRYING TO LAUNCH.

291
00:13:27,004 --> 00:13:30,374
THAT IS SO CUTE!

292
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:32,777
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT!

293
00:13:32,777 --> 00:13:37,481
I'LL BE SURE TO TELL
KEN AND BARBIE THAT
YOU LIKED IT.

294
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:40,151
NOW, WE JUST --

295
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:42,153
SEE, WE JUST PUT OUR BOAT
RAMP INTO PLACE JUST
LIKE THAT, SEE?

296
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:44,288
AH!
YEAH. YEAH.

297
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:46,323
HOW DO YOU
GET ON TO IT?

298
00:13:46,323 --> 00:13:48,392
OH, NO, OKAY, YOU SEE,
YOU DRAG HER BACK

299
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:50,394
JUST PAST THE HALFWAY POINT
AND SHE SLIPS DOWN THIS WAY.

300
00:13:50,394 --> 00:13:52,296
THEN YOU TAKE YOUR UNIT
AND AS YOU DO IT,

301
00:13:52,296 --> 00:13:53,464
SIMPLE AS THIS,

302
00:13:53,464 --> 00:13:55,299
YOU BACK HER UP,
BACK HER UP, BACK HER UP,

303
00:13:55,299 --> 00:13:57,434
THEN ONCE YOU GET PAST
THE HALFWAY POINT, SEE --

304
00:14:05,476 --> 00:14:07,077
Red: WE HAD A PROBLEM.

305
00:14:07,077 --> 00:14:08,512
WE HAD KIND OF
A FLASH FLOOD,

306
00:14:08,512 --> 00:14:10,347
AND WE KNEW THAT THE WATER
WAS GOING TO COME UP
IN POSSUM LAKE

307
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:13,083
BECAUSE MOOSE THOMPSON HAD
DONE A CANNONBALL UP NEAR
PORT ASBESTOS.

308
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,585
AND IT WAS
COMING UP OVER,

309
00:14:14,585 --> 00:14:16,186
AND WE KNEW WE HAD TO DO
SOMETHING AND DO IT QUICK.

310
00:14:16,186 --> 00:14:18,255
AND WE HAD THIS
BOAT OUT THE BACK,

311
00:14:18,255 --> 00:14:20,024
AND SHE WASN'T
IN THE BEST SHAPE,

312
00:14:20,024 --> 00:14:21,825
AND WE THOUGHT IF WE COULD
GET HER OUT OF THE WAY,

313
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:24,128
MOVE HER OUT,
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T FLOAT.

314
00:14:24,128 --> 00:14:26,997
AND UNFORTUNATELY, SHE'S
PRETTY HEAVY AND KIND OF
ROTTED INTO THE GROUND,

315
00:14:26,997 --> 00:14:28,866
SO WE THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,

316
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:31,302
RATHER THAN TRYING TO
MOVE THE BOAT

317
00:14:31,302 --> 00:14:35,005
WHAT WE CAN DO IS TO
BUILD KIND OF A DYKE,
A WALL AROUND IT.

318
00:14:35,005 --> 00:14:36,507
JUST NEEDED A
COUPLE OF SHOVELS.

319
00:14:36,507 --> 00:14:40,210
OKAY, THIS IS THE DOWN SIDE
OF NEVER CLEANING
OUT YOUR VAN.

320
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,413
I'M NOT SAYING YOU HAVE
TO CLEAN OUT YOUR VAN.

321
00:14:42,413 --> 00:14:44,915
JUST THAT IF YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO CLEAN OUT YOUR VAN

322
00:14:44,915 --> 00:14:47,017
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO GET
A SHOVEL OUT OF HER,

323
00:14:47,017 --> 00:14:49,486
YOU GOT TO BE
PRETTY CREATIVE.

324
00:14:52,623 --> 00:14:55,426
SO NOW THE IDEA IS WE'RE
GOING TO DIG UP SOME SAND

325
00:14:55,426 --> 00:14:57,094
AND WE'RE GONNA
MAKE SOME SANDBAGS.

326
00:14:57,094 --> 00:14:59,196
SO I'M TELLING
DALTON AND WALTER

327
00:14:59,196 --> 00:15:00,898
TO GO TO GET US SOME BAGS.

328
00:15:00,898 --> 00:15:02,366
ANY KIND OF
BAGS YOU CAN GET.

329
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:04,368
SO DALTON SEES
A GARBAGE CAN THERE

330
00:15:04,368 --> 00:15:05,602
AND FIGURES HE'LL JUST
USE THOSE GARBAGE BAGS.

331
00:15:05,602 --> 00:15:07,471
SO WE GOT A FAIR
AMOUNT OF SAND THERE,

332
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:09,206
AND THEN WALTER SHOWS UP,

333
00:15:09,206 --> 00:15:10,941
AND I WAS IMPRESSED
THAT HE HAD EMPTIED
THE GARBAGE BAGS FIRST.

334
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:12,443
AND I ASKED HIM, WHERE DID
YOU EMPTY THEM EXACTLY?

335
00:15:12,443 --> 00:15:15,179
AND THEN.

336
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:17,548
I DEFINITELY GOT
TO CLEAN OUT THAT VAN

337
00:15:17,548 --> 00:15:19,550
ONE DAY SOON.

338
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,084
SO WE STARTED MAKING
THE SANDBAGS

339
00:15:21,084 --> 00:15:24,321
AND DID KIND OF LIKE
A BUCKET BRIGADE UNIT THERE.

340
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:26,089
I MEAN, THEY'RE HEAVY.
THEY ARE HEAVY.

341
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:28,559
AND YOU JUST SORT OF
MOVE ONE GUY DOWN TO
THE NEXT AND SO ON.

342
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:31,028
THE WATER WAS STARTING TO COME
UP BUT WE'RE GETTING THERE.

343
00:15:31,028 --> 00:15:32,529
YOU JUST START SLOW

344
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:34,631
AND WATCH OUT FOR
THE SHOVEL THERE, DALTON.

345
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:37,267
OH, BOY. OH, BOY.
OH, BOY...

346
00:15:37,267 --> 00:15:39,236
NO, WE'RE GOOD.

347
00:15:39,236 --> 00:15:41,138
SO GET THAT OUT OF THERE.

348
00:15:41,138 --> 00:15:43,340
I DIDN'T REALIZE IT HAD
ACTUALLY CUT THE BAG,

349
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,109
AND THIS ONE WASN'T QUITE AS
HEAVY AS THE OTHER ONE.

350
00:15:46,109 --> 00:15:49,346
AND I DON'T KNOW QUITE WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO DO WITH
THAT ONE, DALTON.

351
00:15:49,346 --> 00:15:51,215
ANYWAY, TIME WENT BY

352
00:15:51,215 --> 00:15:54,518
AND WE EVENTUALLY
GOT ALL THE BAGS MADE UP.

353
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:56,954
AND DALTON'S WONDERING
HOW HIGH THE WATER IS
AT THIS POINT.

354
00:15:56,954 --> 00:15:58,922
SHE WAS COMING UP
PRETTY GOOD.

355
00:15:58,922 --> 00:16:00,757
SO WALTER, GET
A BOOST UP THERE,

356
00:16:00,757 --> 00:16:02,459
REACH OVER THE SIDE,
AND SEE HOW HIGH THE WATER IS.

357
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:04,194
YOU CAN ACTUALLY FEEL IT.
WATER'S PRETTY CLOSE --

358
00:16:04,194 --> 00:16:06,029
OH, MY GOSH.
LOOK OUT. LOOK OUT. LOOK OUT.

359
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:08,332
OH, OH!

360
00:16:08,332 --> 00:16:11,134
IT'S YOUR WAKE-UP CALL.

361
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:13,036
AND PUT THAT BACK
WHERE IT BELONGS.

362
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:14,705
THERE YOU GO.

363
00:16:14,705 --> 00:16:17,007
LOOK AT THE WATER,
IT'S RIGHT UP THERE.

364
00:16:17,007 --> 00:16:19,409
SUDDENLY, I REMEMBER,
THE POSSUM VAN.

365
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:21,078
OH, MY GOSH.
IT'S CAUGHT OUT THERE.

366
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:22,646
SO WALTER SAYS
HE'LL GO AND GET IT.

367
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:24,247
HE'S GONNA PUT THE
LIFE THING ON,

368
00:16:24,247 --> 00:16:26,183
AND HE'S GONNA USE THE
ROPE FROM THE BOAT TO
ANCHOR HIMSELF

369
00:16:26,183 --> 00:16:27,951
SO HE CAN CONTROL
THE FLOOD AND SO ON,

370
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:29,653
BECAUSE WE'RE PRETTY MUCH
AT THE HEIGHT OVER THERE.

371
00:16:29,653 --> 00:16:31,254
SHE'S STARTIN'
TO COME DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

372
00:16:31,254 --> 00:16:33,790
WHAT HE DIDN'T REALIZE IS
THAT THERE'S A FAIR BIT
OF CURRENT GOING THERE

373
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,993
AND IT'S STARTING
TO PULL ON HIM REAL HARD

374
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:38,428
AND HE ACTUALLY ENDED UP
PULLING THE BOAT

375
00:16:38,428 --> 00:16:41,498
UP AND OVER
THE WALL OF DYKE.

376
00:16:41,498 --> 00:16:43,700
AND BY THEN, OF COURSE,

377
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,769
THE WATER HAD RUN AWAY

378
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:48,038
AND THERE'S WALTER.

379
00:16:48,038 --> 00:16:49,806
OKAY, EVERYTHING'S GOOD.

380
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:51,341
WELL, LOOK AT THIS.

381
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:53,944
I DID GET THE
POSSUM VAN CLEANED OUT.

382
00:17:03,253 --> 00:17:05,088
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE
IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES

383
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:07,224
BETWEEN CANADA AND THE
STATES IS THAT UP HERE

384
00:17:07,224 --> 00:17:11,762
WE GET A $2.40 REFUND FOR
A CASE OF EMPTY BEER BOTTLES.

385
00:17:11,762 --> 00:17:14,598
OH, SURE, UP HERE,
A CASE OF BEER COSTS $20 MORE,

386
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:17,400
BUT THAT ONLY
MATTERS IF YOU'RE BUYING.

387
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,836
SEE, BUT THE PROBLEM IS
OUR AMERICAN FRIENDS

388
00:17:19,836 --> 00:17:21,805
END UP WITH ALL THESE
EMPTY CASES OF BEER,

389
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:24,474
AND THEY'RE LOOKING FOR
SUGGESTIONS ON WHAT
TO DO WITH THEM.

390
00:17:24,474 --> 00:17:26,443
WELL, HERE'S A NATURAL...

391
00:17:26,443 --> 00:17:29,212
AN OUTDOOR URINAL.

392
00:17:29,212 --> 00:17:31,815
KINDA COMPLETES
THE CIRCLE, DOESN'T IT?

393
00:17:31,815 --> 00:17:33,950
AND IN KEEPING WITH
THE BEER CASE MOTIF,

394
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,019
I CUT UP A REFRIGERATOR BOX

395
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:37,454
AND MADE FLAPS FOR
THE TOP OF THE UNIT

396
00:17:37,454 --> 00:17:41,057
SO THAT IT CLOSES UP,
JUST LIKE THE REAL THING.

397
00:17:42,392 --> 00:17:44,160
AND THE BEAUTY
OF THIS DESIGN,

398
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,762
IN THE GOOD WEATHER,

399
00:17:45,762 --> 00:17:47,931
YOU CAN JUST PUSH UP ON THE
ROOF, MAKE YOURSELF A SKYLIGHT.

400
00:17:51,268 --> 00:17:53,403
MIND YOU, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT
ALL THAT DARK IN HERE

401
00:17:53,403 --> 00:17:56,072
'CAUSE I ADDED A FEW
BEER BOTTLE WINDOWS.

402
00:17:56,072 --> 00:17:57,741
THEY LET THE LIGHT IN,

403
00:17:57,741 --> 00:17:59,476
BUT THEY STILL
MAINTAIN YOUR PRIVACY.

404
00:17:59,476 --> 00:18:01,611
AND IT'S YOUR
CHOICE ON THOSE.

405
00:18:01,611 --> 00:18:05,081
YOU CAN GO WITH THE
STANDARD BROWN LONGNECKS,

406
00:18:05,081 --> 00:18:07,284
OR, FOR A LITTLE
TASTE OF MEXICO,

407
00:18:07,284 --> 00:18:08,985
TRY THE CLEAR BOTTLES,

408
00:18:08,985 --> 00:18:10,954
AND IF YOU REALLY WANT TO
IMPRESS THE NEIGHBOURS,

409
00:18:10,954 --> 00:18:13,490
GO WITH THE GREEN IMPORTS.

410
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:16,626
NOW, THE TOILET ITSELF
IS AN EMPTY KEG.

411
00:18:16,626 --> 00:18:20,263
JUST CRACK THE LID UP,
AND YOU'RE IN BUSINESS.

412
00:18:20,263 --> 00:18:21,998
OH, SURE, IT'S A
LITTLE CRAMPED,

413
00:18:21,998 --> 00:18:23,667
BUT AS I SAY,
THIS IS A MEN'S URINAL...

415
00:18:25,301 --> 00:18:27,003
MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID

416
00:18:27,003 --> 00:18:29,406
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOUR
HEALTH TO SIT IN A DRAFT.

417
00:18:31,841 --> 00:18:33,910
IT WAS A GOOD IDEA
TO BUILD A MODEL.

418
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,746
YOU KNOW, HAROLD WAS RIGHT.
BOY, THAT'S HARD TO SAY.

419
00:18:36,746 --> 00:18:38,782
BUT WE GOT HER
ALL FIGURED OUT.

420
00:18:38,782 --> 00:18:41,618
WE ACTUALLY GOT THE REAL THING
OUT FOR A TRIAL RUN THERE.

421
00:18:41,618 --> 00:18:44,220
MIKE'S ACTUALLY GOING
TO BE OUR TEST PILOT.

422
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,157
OKAY, MR. GREEN, I'M ALL
SET TO DRIVE THE POSSUM VAN.

423
00:18:47,157 --> 00:18:48,491
HAVE YOU GOT
THE KEYS?

424
00:18:48,491 --> 00:18:51,294
NO, I THINK
THEY'RE IN IT.
NOT A PROBLEM.

425
00:18:51,294 --> 00:18:53,396
BUT MIKE, WHAT IF
THEY'RE NOT IN IT?

426
00:18:53,396 --> 00:18:55,331

00:18:56,299 --> 00:18:57,567
HEY, UNCLE RED.

428
00:18:57,567 --> 00:18:59,369
HAROLD, WE'VE HAD A BIT
OF A BREAKTHROUGH HERE.

429
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:01,671
WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE
TO GET THE POSSUM VAN
OVER THE SCRAP,

430
00:19:01,671 --> 00:19:04,407
WE JUST GOT TO GET THE
BOAT TO GO OVER THE SCRAP.

431
00:19:04,407 --> 00:19:06,176
REALLY?
YEAH. YEAH.

432
00:19:06,176 --> 00:19:08,945
SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE
MOVED THE MARINA

433
00:19:08,945 --> 00:19:10,847
'CAUSE NOBODY
USES IT ANYWAY,

UNLESS THERE ARE
WOMEN THERE,

435
00:19:12,215 --> 00:19:14,584

DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH

439

THEN I FIRMED UP THE HITCH

00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,765
