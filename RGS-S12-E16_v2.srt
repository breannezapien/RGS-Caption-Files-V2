1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:08,141
WELL, I MEAN EVERYBODY WHO
PREFERS SPORTS TO, SAY,
CONVERSATION.

2
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:10,410
THE PROBLEM IS THEY'RE
SO DARNED EXPENSIVE.

3
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:12,445
WHAT IF I COULD SHOW YOU
THAT YOU COULD HAVE

4
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:15,382
A BIG SCREEN TV
FOR UNDER $10.00?

5
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,984
LIKE, SAY, $9.95.

6
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,620
THAT'S HOW MUCH IT COSTS FOR
A SET OF THESE CASTORS.

7
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,722
NOW YOU JUST JAM THESE BABIES

8
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,557
INTO THE BOTTOM OF YOUR
FAVOURITE CHAIR.

9
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:27,027
MIGHT WANT TO PUT A LITTLE
GREASE ON THERE FIRST,

10
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:29,596
BECAUSE IF THEY
SQUEAK AT ALL,

11
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:31,798
YOUR MOTHER'S GOING TO FORCE
YOU TO TAKE A LITTLE
CASTOR OIL.

12
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,302
NOW, YOU MAY BE SITTING
THERE THINKING,

13
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,105
HOW DOES A SET OF CASTORS
GET ME A BIG SCREEN TV?

14
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:42,375
WELL, THAT TELLS ME I HAVE
TWO THINGS THAT YOU
DON'T HAVE...

15
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:43,810
IMAGINATION...

16
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:45,945
AND A CROOKED FLOOR.

17
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:04,297
[cheers and applause]

18
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:10,703
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

19
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,908
APPRECIATE THAT.

20
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,477
BIG, BIG CHANGES UP
AT THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

21
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,779
YOU PROBABLY NOTICED HOW NEAT
AND TIDY EVERYTHING IS.

22
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:25,051
THAT'S BECAUSE WE'RE NOT
JUST A LODGE ANY MORE.

23
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,456
HAROLD'S ALSO TRYING TO TURN
US INTO A BED AND BREAKFAST.

24
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:33,026
HE'S CALLING IT THE SLEEPY
POSSUM BED AND BREAKFAST.

25
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,061
I DON'T THINK
IT'S GONNA WORK.

26
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:37,197
I WOULD BE VERY WARY
OF EATING BREAKFAST

27
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,399
AT ANY PLACE THAT HAD THE
WORD POSSUM IN THE NAME.

28
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,734
[bell ringing]

29
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,603
OH, FRONT, FRONT.

30
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,606
OUR FIRST GUEST
HAS ARRIVED.

31
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:49,042
WHY ARE YOU TELLING
ME, HAROLD?

32
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,211
I'M NOT YOUR FRONT MAN.

33
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,846
C'MON, UNCLE RED.

34
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:54,547
IF THIS IS
GOING TO WORK,

35
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,049
WE NEED TO HAVE
PROFESSIONAL SERVICE.

36
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,751
YOU NEED TO HAVE
PROFESSIONAL HELP.

37
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,987
WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT RUNNING A BED
AND BREAKFAST.

38
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,355
IT'S EASY.

39
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,190
YOU JUST HAVE
TO LIKE PEOPLE.

40
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,925
OH, GREAT.

41
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,760
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.
WE'RE GOING TO PRACTICE.

42
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,762
I'VE GOT
A GUINEA PIG.

43
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:12,332
OUR FIRST GUEST IS
GOING TO BE Ã  la maison.

44
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:14,033
AL WHO?

45
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,635
A la maison --
mais --

46
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:17,403
HE'S STAYING FOR FREE.

47
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:18,404
OH, MIKE.

48
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,244
BONJOUR, MONSIEUR.

49
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,146
AND WELCOME TO THE
POSSUM BED AND BREAKFAST.

50
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,314
YOUR ROOM AWAITS.

51
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,586
WHAT A DUMP!

52
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,322
GET MY BAG!

53
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,661
OH, BOY,
GET HIS BAG!

54
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,765
HIS BAG,
GET HIS BAG.

55
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,500
HIS BAG.

56
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,003
OKAY,
I'LL GET IT.

57
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,478
IT'S TIME FOR
THE POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

58
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:02,549
[cheers and applause]

59
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,422
TODAY'S WINNER RECEIVES AN
ASSORTMENT OF LOOSE CHANGE

60
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:12,525
FROM McGINTY'S
TRAMPOLINE PARK

61
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:15,295
WHERE EVERYTHING BOUNCES,
INCLUDING THE CHEQUES.

62
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,431
OKAY, COVER YOUR
THINGIES, WINSTON.

63
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,633
OKAY, MR. GREEN,
YOU'VE GOT 30 SECONDS

64
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,769
TO GET WINSTON TO SAY
THIS WORD...

65
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:26,439
ALL RIGHT, MIKE.

66
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,007
AND... GO!

67
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,943
OKAY, WINSTON,
THIS IS SOMETHING

68
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:31,811
THAT YOU GO ON,
ON A SATURDAY NIGHT.

69
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:34,247
A PUMP-OUT.

70
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,583
OKAY, NO, THIS IS
WHEN YOU GO OUT

71
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:39,018
AND YOU'RE DRESSED UP,
MAYBE TAKE SOME FLOWERS.

72
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,787
FUNERAL?

73
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,222
NO. OKAY, NO.

74
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,723
IF A WOMAN AGREED
TO GO OUT WITH YOU,

75
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:44,958
THAT WOULD BE
CALLED A...

76
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,427
MIRACLE.

77
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,163
I KNOW!
YOU'VE GOT A
CALENDAR IN YOUR SHOP.

78
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,198
WHAT'S ON IT?

79
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,667
A PICTURE
OF MIKE'S MOM.

80
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,404
ALMOST OUT OF TIME,
MR. GREEN.

81
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,640
OKAY, WINSTON,
TODAY IS THE SIXTH.

82
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,542
YOU COULD ALSO
THE SIXTH IS...

83
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,711
OH, MY ANNIVERSARY!

84
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:08,014
YEAH, IT WAS 12 YEARS AGO
TODAY I GOT MY SEPTIC TRUCK.

85
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,849
IT WAS A DATE
WITH DESTINY.

86
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,751
THERE WE GO!

87
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,757
[quirky upbeat music]

88
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,061
TODAY ON TALKING
ANIMALS,

89
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,631
LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL
OFFICER, ED FRID,

90
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:27,233
HAS BROUGHT IN A
SURPRISE ANIMAL FOR US.

91
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,768
C'MON UP HERE, ED.

92
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,738
COME ON. COME ON.

93
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,340
WELL, OKAY.
THAT'S RIGHT.

94
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,042
WHAT WE HAVE HERE

95
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,278
IS THE SINGLE MOST
DANGEROUS ANIMAL
IN THE WORLD.

96
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:39,912
WOW!

97
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,415
KIND OF A SMALL
CAGE, ISN'T IT?

98
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,284
IS THIS THING ANY MORE
DANGEROUS THAN A CROCODILE?

99
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,386
OH, YEAH.

100
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,987
MORE DANGEROUS
THAN A COBRA?

101
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,456
YEAH, I KNOW ALL
THE ANIMALS, RED.

102
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,992
I DON'T JUST MAKE
ARBITRARY CHOICES

103
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:56,062
AND TRY TO BACK THEM UP WITH
OUTRAGEOUS CLAIMS, YOU KNOW?

104
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,097
NO. I'M NOT
SAYING THAT --

105
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,933
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
BEING AN ANIMAL
CONTROL OFFICER

106
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,736
BEFORE YOU START SHOOTING
OFF YOUR MOUTH, HUH?

107
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,440
YEAH, MAYBE AFTER YOU'VE
BEEN MAULED BY A PUMA.

108
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,909
YOU EVER BEEN
MAULED BY A PUMA?

109
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,545
THAT'S NOT THE
POINT, RED!

110
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,380
THE POINT IS, AT ANY TIME,

111
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,182
I COULD BE
MAULED BY A PUMA

112
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,017
AND DRAGGED
INTO ITS CAVE.

113
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,786
WELL, WE ALL
HAVE PROBLEMS.

114
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,822
I OFTEN GET DRAGGED
INTO A MALL.

115
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:26,526
JOKES DON'T WORK
IN THE ANIMAL
KINGDOM, RED.

116
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,361
OKAY, FINE.
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU

117
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,096
JUST SHOW US WHATEVER
YOU'VE GOT HERE.

118
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,698
OKAY, WELL, THAT'S
WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO.

119
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,166
I DIDN'T DRAG THIS
DANGEROUS ANIMAL

120
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,534
ALL THE WAY OVER HERE
TO NOT SHOW IT TO YOU.

121
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,935
SO STAND BACK

122
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,603
AND, YOU KNOW, DON'T
MAKE ANY SUDDEN MOVES.

123
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,808
LOOK OUT!

124
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,309
ED, THAT'S A
HAMSTER.

125
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,611
OH, I KNOW.

126
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,747
YOU'RE SAYING HAMSTERS
ARE DANGEROUS?

127
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,917
OTHER ANIMALS PICK
THEM UP AND THROW
THEM AT YOU?

128
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,319
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS A CHILD,

129
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,355
I HAD A HAMSTER.

130
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,725
MISTER WINKLEBOTTOM
WAS VERY CUTE.

131
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,259
OKAY. I SEE.

132
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,661
YOU BLAME YOUR HAMSTER

133
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,563
FOR YOU BECOMING AN
ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER.

134
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,465
AND ISN'T IT
NICE FOR YOU

135
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,567
TO BE ABLE TO
PUT EVERYONE'S LIFE
INTO A NICE, NEAT

136
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,737
LITTLE COMPARTMENT
LIKE THAT, HUH?

137
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,774
SO YOU BLAME YOUR
HAMSTER FOR YOU
BECOMING AN --

138
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,343
OKAY. YES. YES.
YES! YES!

139
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,513
AND PARENTS, DON'T GET
YOUR CHILDREN HAMSTERS.

140
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,081
GET THEM AN EDUCATION.

141
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,183
GET THEM
AN OFFICE JOB.

142
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,285
GET THEM
A THERAPIST.

143
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,666
DON'T YOU JUST HATE
GETTING SPEEDING
TICKETS?

144
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,468
THEY COST YOU MONEY.

145
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,537
MAKES YOU LATE FOR WHEREVER
IT WAS YOU WERE GOING.

146
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,239
THAT MAKES YOU
SPEED EVEN MORE.

147
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:47,740
THEN THEY NAIL YOU AGAIN,

148
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,242
AND THE FINES GO
HIGHER AND HIGHER.

149
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:50,910
FINALLY, YOU LOSE
YOUR LICENSE

150
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,912
AND END UP SPENDING
30 DAYS IN THE SLAMMER.

151
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:56,048
YOU KNOW, IT'S ALMOST
ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU
WANT TO SLOW DOWN.

152
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,618
SO I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

153
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,686
YOU CAN GET A WAY
WITH SPEEDING

154
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,456
AS LONG AS THE GUY IN FRONT
OF YOU IS ALSO SPEEDING.

155
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:06,058
SPEEDING IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE
OF A WEDDING NIGHT...

156
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,561
YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE FIRST.

157
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,563
SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO

158
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,331
IS GET YOURSELF A BUNCH OF
LARGE CARDBOARD BOXES,

159
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,966
MAYBE FROM A REFRIGERATOR

160
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,501
OR A THIGH-MASTER
OR WHATEVER.

161
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,637
MAKE YOURSELF A FAKE
CAR OUT OF IT, HUH?

162
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,205
THEN YOU CAN PAINT IT
ANY COLOUR YOU WANT

163
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,508
AND THEN HOLD IT TOGETHER
WITH THE HANDYMAN'S
SECRET WEAPON,

164
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,777
WHICH ALSO DOUBLES
AS CHROME.

165
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,215
AND GEAR THE
TYPE OF CAR

166
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,817
TO YOUR PERSONAL
ARTISTIC ABILITY...

167
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,686
IF YOU'RE USELESS,
MAKE IT A RUSSIAN CAR;

168
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,755
IF YOU'RE GOOD,
MAKE IT A FRENCH CAR.

169
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,457
THE CAR WON'T RUN,

170
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,358
SO ACTUALLY BRITISH
IS A PERFECT CHOICE.

171
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,765
NOW, THIS MAY NOT LOOK
LIKE A CAR TO YOU AND I,

172
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:49,135
BUT LUCKILY, WE ONLY
HAVE TO FOOL THE COPS.

173
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,371
BESIDES, THE CAR
WILL BE SPEEDING,

174
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:53,806
SO IT'S GOING TO BE
HARD TO TELL.

175
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,675
AND THE WAY WE'RE
GOING TO MAKE IT SPEED

176
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,177
IS BY SITTING IT ON
TOP OF THIS PLATFORM

177
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,347
THAT I GOT HOOKED UP ON
TOP OF THE POSSUM VAN.

178
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,583
SO THE CAR'LL BE GOING THE
SAME SPEED THAT I DO, SEE?

179
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,085
ONLY IT'LL BE THE
ONE THAT GETS PULLED OVER.

180
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,054
OKAY, NOW,
THE PULLING OVER PART,

181
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,622
THAT'S A LITTLE TRICKY.

182
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,024
I GOT THIS PUSHBAR SECURED
TO THE ONE END THERE

183
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,727
SO IT WILL PIVOT
AND PUSH THE CAR OFF.

184
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,730
AND THIS LATCH HOLDS
IT BACK LIKE A GATE

185
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:19,832
UNTIL THE TIME COMES.

186
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:23,102
I JUST GOT TO DECIDE
WHAT SIZE SPRING TO USE

187
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,771
THAT'LL HAVE ENOUGH JAM TO
PUSH THE CAR OFF THERE,

188
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,840
BUT NOT SEND HER INTO
THE NEXT COUNTY.

189
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,777
NOW, I'M SURE THERE'S A
MATHEMATICAL FORMULA

190
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,312
FOR FIGURING THAT OUT,

191
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,147
BUT I PREFER
TRIAL AND ERROR.

192
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,216
IT'S QUICKER,
IT'S MORE FUN,

193
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,085
AND IT'S REALLY
ONE OF THE UPSIDES

194
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,520
OF HAVING
SOCIALIZED MEDICINE.

195
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,407
OKAY, I'VE DECIDED
TO GO WITH

196
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,009
THE MEDIUM SIZED
COIL SPRING THERE.

197
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,544
I'VE ALSO SET
HERE NOW THOUGH.

198
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,612
AND I CONTROL
THE PUSHBAR

199
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,215
WITH THIS HIGH-TECH
LATCH RELEASE, EH?

200
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,250
NOW WHEN I COME
SPEEDING OVER THE HILL,

201
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,852
THE COPS'LL WAVE
THE CAR OVER.

202
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,421
ALL'S I DO IS
PULL ON THE STRING.

203
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,189
THEY GET A LOAD
OF CARDBOARD,

204
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,325
AND I GET OUT OF DODGE.

205
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:25,531
THIS MAY BE MY
SMARTEST IDEA YET.

206
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:28,067
OR MAYBE IT'S JUST
TOO CLOSE TO CALL.

207
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,568
TAILGATING.

208
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,172
[laughter and applause]

209
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,513
[quirky upbeat music]

210
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:18,551
I NEEDED SOMETHING FROM THE
HARDWARE STORE THE OTHER DAY,

211
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,386
SO I ASKED MY WIFE
IF SHE'D LIKE ME

212
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,555
TO PICK UP ANYTHING
FOR HER WHILE I WAS OUT.

213
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,290
SHE SAID,
OH, NO, NO, NO.

214
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:25,992
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

215
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,029
OKAY.

216
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,897
SO THE NEXT
THING YOU KNOW,

217
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,599
WE'RE WELL IN TO
OUR SECOND HOUR

218
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,268
AT THE MALL,
LOOKING FOR SHOES.

219
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,270
NOW, THERE WAS A
TIME IN OUR MARRIAGE

220
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,640
WHEN I WOULD'VE
SAID SOMETHING NEGATIVE

221
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:44,010
ABOUT HOW A MAN WHO
ONLY NEEDS DRYWALL SCREWS

222
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:45,778
ENDS UP GIVING OPINIONS ON

223
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,280
20 OR 30 PAIRS
OF SLING-BACK PUMPS

224
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,416
THAT ALL PRETTY MUCH LOOK
IDENTICAL TO HIM.

225
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,620
WELL, I DON'T DO
THAT ANYMORE.

226
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,756
NO, I JUST FOLLOWED
ALONG QUIETLY,

227
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,624
THINKING WHAT
A GREAT GUY I AM

228
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,326
TO BE SHOPPING
WITH MY WIFE

229
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,194
AND NOT EVEN
COMPLAINING ABOUT IT.

230
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,997
BUT APPARENTLY
I WAS WRONG.

231
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:08,434
SHE TOOK ME ASIDE
BY THE WIENIE WAGON

232
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,836
AND POINTED OUT
THAT MY ATTITUDE

233
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,740
WAS DESTROYING THE ENTIRE
SHOPPING EXPERIENCE.

234
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:18,644
SHE SAID, THIS IS SUPPOSED
TO BE FUN, ISN'T IT?

235
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:22,581
AND I NODDED INSTEAD
OF TELLING THE TRUTH.

236
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:25,251
AND THEN IT
HIT ME, OKAY.

237
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,086
WHEN YOU HAVE
A LIFE PARTNER,

238
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,554
IT'S NOT ENOUGH
TO DO THINGS WITH THEM.

239
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:32,091
YOU HAVE TO WANT 
TO DO THINGS WITH THEM.

240
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,293
OTHERWISE IT'S JUST
NOT GONNA WORK.

241
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:37,163
SO IT'S NOT ENOUGH THAT
I GO SHOPPING WITH MY WIFE;

242
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,299
I HAVE TO WANT 
TO SHOPPING WITH MY WIFE.

243
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,301
I UNDERSTAND THAT NOW,

244
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:45,137
AND THAT'S WHY I SIGNED UP
FOR ACTING LESSONS.

245
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,740
REMEMBER,
I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

246
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,875
WE'RE ALL IN
THIS TOGETHER.

247
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,712
[applause]

248
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:56,515
WHEN SEPTICS GO BAD,
IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT.

249
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,951
IT JUST MEANS YOUR SEWAGE
HAS COME TO A HALT.

250
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,686
CALL ROTHSCHILD'S.

251
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,221
WE'LL GIVE IT
OUR FULL-SCALE ASSAULT.

252
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,990
AND UNLOCK THE TREASURE THAT'S
TRAPPED IN YOUR VAULT.

253
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:11,297
WELL, THE BED AND BREAKFAST
ISN'T WORKING OUT SO GOOD.

254
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,732
I THINK HAROLD
MAY HAVE BITTEN OFF

255
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,033
MORE THAN HE CAN CHEW,

256
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,735
EVEN WITH THOSE TEETH.

257
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,436
UNCLE RED!
UNCLE RED!

258
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,971
I'VE GOTTA GO
BACK INTO TOWN

259
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,339
AND GET SOME MORE
GROCERIES FOR MIKE.

260
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,241
YOU'D THINK A GUY
WHO EATS HIS MEALS
OFF A TIN TRAY

261
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,976
WOULDN'T BE SO
DEMANDING.

262
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,644
AM I SUPPOSED
TO LOOK AFTER MIKE
WHILE YOU'RE GONE?

263
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,179
I'LL JUST BE
A FEW MINUTES.

264
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,181
I GAVE HIM THE BELL TO RING
IN CASE HE WANTS ANYTHING.

265
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,950
BUT I DON'T THINK
HE'LL BOTHER YOU.

266
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,551
[bell ringing]

267
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:35,654
BYE.

268
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,391
OH, THANK YOU,
HAROLD.

269
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,531
DIDN'T YOU HEAR
ME TINKLING?

270
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,566
[laughter]

271
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,303
I TRY NOT TO
LISTEN, MIKE.

272
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,973
WHAT KIND OF AN
ESTABLISHMENT IS
THIS ANYWAY?

273
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:57,143
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
A FOUR-STAR HOTEL.

274
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,211
IF YOU DON'T GET
A LONGER BATH ROBE,

275
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,714
IT'LL BE FOUR
STARS AND A MOON.

276
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,682
I EXPECT
EXCELLENT SERVICE,

277
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,251
AND I'M GONNA STAY
HERE TILL I GET IT.

278
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,852
[bell ringing]

279
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,288
NO! NO!
GIVE ME THE BELL!

280
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,991
STOP BEING
A DINK.

281
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,828
AH, GEEZ.
IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

282
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:17,563
I MEAN, THIS IS
AN EXPERIMENT

283
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,698
TO SEE IF YOU'VE
GOT WHAT IT TAKES.

284
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,467
AND IF I ENJOY
THE EXPERIENCE,

285
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,536
I WILL INFORM MY FRIENDS.

286
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,070
YOUR FRIENDS?

287
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,306
THIS IS A
BED AND BREAKFAST,
NOT A HALFWAY HOUSE.

288
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,377
WELL, WHAT ABOUT HAROLD?

289
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,379
I MEAN, HE'S PUT
HIS HEART AND SOUL

290
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:34,847
INTO MAKING THIS
BED AND BREAKFAST WORK.

291
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,482
AT LEAST WE SHOULD
GIVE A TRY FOR HIM,

292
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:37,817
DON'T YOU THINK?

293
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,385
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

294
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:40,853
BUT IT'S A BED
AND BREAKFAST, OKAY?

295
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,322
YOU GO BACK TO BED,
AND I'LL GO MAKE
SOME BREAKFAST.

296
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,124
CAN I HAVE
THE BELL?

297
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,592
DO YOU PROMISE
NOT TO RING IT?

298
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,394
I SWEAR.

299
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,029
OKAY.

300
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,197
YOU'RE NOT
GONNA RING IT?

301
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,264
NOPE.

302
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,399
YOU BETTER
NOT RING IT.

303
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:54,733
BETTER NOT.
I WON'T.

304
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,336
I WON'T.

305
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,839
HE'S RIGHT, YOU KNOW?

306
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:04,109
Red (voiceover):
YOU YOUNGSTERS MIGHT
 
WANNA WATCH THIS BECAUSE --

307
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,011
STAY AWAY IF YOU SEE YOUR 
DAD WORKING ON SOMETHING.
 

308
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:16,455
LIKE I SAY, WALTER SHOULD 
STAND OFF TO THE SIDE.
 

309
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,224
BUT INSTEAD -- 
I WAS ADJUSTING THE CHOKE, 

310
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,892
HE'S GOTTA GET 
RIGHT DOWN. 

311
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,660
AND HERE, AGAIN, 
YOU WANNA STAY BACK. 

312
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,433
SO THEN HE GETS THE IDEA 
MAYBE HE'LL PULL START IT. 

313
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:28,968
MIGHT BE A LITTLE SAFER. 

314
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,836
WALTER'S GOT 
THE BIG MUSCLES. 

315
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,105
MAYBE TOO MANY MUSCLES. 

316
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,407
OKAY, THAT'S NOT 
REALLY HELPING.
 

317
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:38,043
DON'T WORRY. 
WE'VE STILL GOT THE CORD.
 

318
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,979
I'M THINKING 
ANOTHER WAY TO GO, 

319
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,081
RATHER THAN PULLING 
THE LAWN MOWER BY HAND,
 

320
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,916
IS IF WE COULD EXTEND 
THE STARTER CORD
 

321
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,784
AND THEN ATTACH IT TO 
A BUCKET FULL OF BRICKS. 

322
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,887
AND WE LIVE ON THE EDGE 
OF THE ESCARPMENT THERE.
 

323
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,923
THAT WOULD GIVE HER 
A GOOD JOLT THERE.
 

324
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,758
YEAH. JUST -- 
OKAY, I'M ALL SET. 

325
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,260
YEAH, FIRE HER OVER. 
FIRE HER OVER. 

326
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,695
THAT SHOULD 
START HER UP.
 

327
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:58,998
BUT APPARENTLY DIDN'T 
HAVE MY FOOT, UH,
 

328
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,066
HELD DOWN STRONG 
ENOUGH ONTO THE MOWER, 

329
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,968
AND THEN, OH, BOY. 
OH, BOY. OKAY. 

330
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,370
WALTER, GRAB THE -- 
GRAB THE LAWN MOWER!
 

331
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,138
GRAB IT! GRAB IT! 

332
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,509
OKAY, SO -- 
OKAY. OKAY.
 

333
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,244
WE'LL TRY SOMETHING ELSE. 

334
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,246
WALTER'S UP IN 
THE TREE WITH THE MOWER.  

335
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,181
GRAB THE HANDLE 
AND DROP THE MOWER,
 

336
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,450
AND MAYBE THE GRAVITY 
WILL HELP US THAT WAY.
 

337
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,119
AND THERE SHE GOES! 

338
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,487
UH-OH! 

339
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,955
OH! OH! 

340
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,623
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. 

341
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,892
YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? 
THE END JUSTIFIES THE MEANS. 

342
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,894
THE LAWN MOWER'S RUNNING,  

343
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,064
AND BOY, IT'S A LITTLE BIT 
COOLER IN MY HAT. 

344
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,266
ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO 
FIX MY HAT, 

345
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,669
AND WALTER, WHY DON'T 
YOU GO CUT THE LAWN?
 

346
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,570
AWAY YOU GO. 

347
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:41,340
[applause]

348
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,711
[quirky upbeat music]

349
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,684
NO, NOT QUITE READY
FOR YOU YET.

350
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,252
JUST GO UP TO THE
END OF THE LAKE THERE

351
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,653
AND COME BACK.

352
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,122
JUST GO ONE TIME.
OKAY? GOOD.

353
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,091
YOU KNOW,
IF THERE'S ONE THING

354
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,060
MIDDLE AGED GUYS DON'T DO
AS QUICKLY AS WE USED TO,

355
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,761
IT'S NONE OF
YOUR BUSINESS.

356
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,530
BUT IF THERE'S
TWO THINGS,

357
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,231
THE OTHER ONE IS RUNNING.

358
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,900
NOW, I'M NOT
A JOGGER MYSELF,

359
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,702
BUT IF I WAS,

360
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,837
I'D BE LOOKING FOR SOME
EXCUSE TO RUN SLOWER.

361
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,505
OH, NO, NO, NOT YET.

362
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,374
JUST GIVE ME ONE MORE.
ONE MORE, WALTER.

363
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:16,742
YEAH. THAT'D BE GREAT.
THAT'D BE GREAT.

364
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,110
SUPER. SUPER. GOOD.

365
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,145
OKAY, UH, THESE
ARE ANKLE WEIGHTS.

366
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,580
SEE, WHEN YOU
HAVE THESE ON,

367
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,615
NOBODY EXPECTS
YOU TO GO FAST.

368
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,951
THE PROBLEM WITH WEIGHTS IS
THEY TEND TO HAVE...

369
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,419
WEIGHT.

370
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,090
SO WHAT I'VE DONE IS

371
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,725
I TOOK SOME OF THESE
KIDS' WATER WINGS,

372
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,593
I BLEW THEM UP,
AND THEN WHAT I DID,

373
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,362
I COVERED THEM
WITH DUCT TAPE.

374
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:37,863
OKAY, THIS IS PERFECT.

375
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,465
PERFECT TIMING, WALTER.

376
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,600
GREAT.
WORKING OUT GREAT.

377
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,803
WALTER'S GONNA DEMONSTRATE
HOW GREAT THIS IS.

378
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,372
I MEAN, LOOK AT
THESE BABIES, EH!

379
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,374
THEY LOOK LIKE THEY WEIGH
ABOUT 50 POUNDS EACH,

380
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,942
WHEN IN FACT THEY'RE
LIGHTER THAN AIR.

381
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,777
WELL, NO, OKAY, THEY'RE
NOT LIGHTER THAN AIR.

382
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,045
THEY ARE AIR.

383
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,446
I MEAN, LET'S NOT MAKE A
BIG DEAL OUT OF IT, OKAY?

384
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,281
IT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

385
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,950
OKAY, WALTER,
COME ON.

386
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,485
AWAY YOU GO NOW.

387
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:00,586
THAT'S GREAT.
AWAY YOU GO.

388
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:01,954
TAKE IT EASY.

389
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,489
YOU KNOW, WITH ANKLE
WEIGHTS THAT SIZE,

390
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,258
YOU HAVE PERMISSION TO GO
AS SLOW AS YOU WANT.

391
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,093
JUST ANOTHER
BRILLIANT CONCEPT --

392
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,862
[Walter yells,
water splashes]

393
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,597
OH, MAN.

394
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,478
[applause]

395
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,916
UNCLE RED, WE'RE AT THE
CRITICAL POINT OF OUR PROJECT.

396
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,018
WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO BE A
SUCCESSFUL BED AND BREAKFAST
 

397
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,454
COMES DOWN TO ONE THING,
AND ONE THING ONLY...

398
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,056
THE BREAKFAST.

399
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,191
ARE YOU READY TO GIVE
IT YOUR BEST SHOT?

400
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,360
WELL, I'M READY TO GIVE
SOMEBODY MY BEST SHOT, HAROLD.

401
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,732
BONJOUR!
BONJOUR!

402
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,835
OH, DON'T YOU LOOK STRIKING
IN THAT OUTFIT, SIR?

403
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,570
MIGHT I ASK,
IS THAT A RALPH LAUREN?

404
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,772
UH, NO, IT'S
A LEAVENWORTH.

405
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,709
VERY WELL.
YOUR SEAT, SIR.

406
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,779
COULD I INTEREST
YOU IN A DRINK?

407
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,148
FRESHLY SQUEEZED
GRAPEFRUIT JUICE.

408
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,184
OH, EXCELLENT CHOICE, SIR.

409
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,119
FLORIDA BIB BALL
AND DRAIN 'EM!

410
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,225
GRAPEFRUIT JUICE.

411
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,526
OH. OH.

412
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:49,862
THERE'S A SEED
IN MY JUICE.

413
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:52,731
THERE IS A SEED
IN MONSIEUR'S JUICE.

414
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:58,003
TERRIBLY SORRY.
IT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.

415
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,114
THANK YOU.

416
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,386
I WILL HAVE THE SCRAMBLED
EGGS ON THE TOAST.

417
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,054
EXCELLENT!

418
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,557
ADAM AND EVE ON
A RAFT AND WRECK 'EM!

419
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,375
AND I'LL HAVE A
LOW-FAT SOY CAPPUCCINO

420
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,177
WITH ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER.

421
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:40,412
LOW-FAT SOY CAP.
ART. SWEET!

422
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:12,811
GO NUTS.

423
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,188
IS SOMETHING
WRONG, SIR?

424
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,757
DO YOU WANT ME
TO EAT THAT?

425
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,060
NO.

426
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:30,495
I DO.

427
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,598
NO! NO! NO!

428
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:37,002
NO, FORGET THIS WHOLE
BED AND BREAKFAST PROJECT.

429
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,704
I'M CANCELLING
THE WHOLE THING.

430
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,473
UNCLE RED, YOU DON'T
HAVE WHAT IT TAKES FOR
CUSTOMER SERVICE.

431
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:43,308
YOU KNOW, HAROLD,
THAT MAY BE THE
NICEST THING

432
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,110
YOU'VE EVER
SAID TO ME.

433
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,878
WELL, THAT'S ALL
VERY WELL AND GOOD,

434
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:48,747
BUT I STILL THINK I
SHOULD GET MY MONEY BACK.

435
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,115
I AGREE.

436
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:51,917
HE DIDN'T PAY
ANYTHING!

437
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,585
[possum squealing]

438
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,220
MEETING TIME.

439
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,888
YEAH, YOU GUYS GO AHEAD.
I'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.

440
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:01,994
OKAY, IF MY WIFE
IS WATCHING,

441
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,762
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT
HOME AFTER THE MEETING.

442
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,764
I'D MUCH RATHER BE AT
YOUR BED AND BREAKFAST.

443
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:08,066
NOBODY CAN COMPETE WITH YOUR
HOSPITALITY AND PRICES,

444
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,402
AND THAT'S JUST
THE BED PART.

445
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,271
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

446
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,640
ON BEHALF OF HAROLD AND
THE WHOLE GANG UP HERE
AT POSSUM LODGE,

447
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,608
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

448
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:21,780
[cheers and applause]

449
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,351
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.
SIT DOWN. HAVE A SEAT.

450
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,654
EVERYONE SIT DOWN.
COME ON, TAKE A SEAT.

451
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,523
THERE WE GO.
EVERYONE SIT.

452
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,760
ALL RISE.

453
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,965
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI. 

454
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,533
Red: SIT DOWN.

455
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,237
ALL RIGHT, BOW YOUR HEADS
FOR THE MAN'S PRAYER.

456
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,507
I'M A MAN,
BUT I CAN CHANGE,

457
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,842
IF I HAVE TO, I GUESS.

458
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:54,579
ALL RIGHT, MEN,
THE SLEEPY POSSUM

459
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,149
BED AND BREAKFAST
EXPERIMENT IS OVER.

460
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:59,951
FROM NOW ON, IF YOU WANNA
HAVE BED AND BREAKFAST
WITH A STRANGER

461
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,287
STEAL A CAR.

462
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:06,758
