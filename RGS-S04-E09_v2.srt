MOST MEN AND WOMEN
ARE IMPULSE BUYERS,

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:06,106
BUT THERE'S A
DIFFERENCE.

3
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:08,174

AND THEN FINALLY JUST
COULDN'T RESIST
THIS PRICE.

8
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,282
AND WHEN IT TURNS
OUT TO BE A MISTAKE,

9
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:18,318
A WOMAN WILL JUST TAKE
IT BACK OR GIVE IT

10

JUST THROW IT AWAY

TRY TO COVER.

HE'LL ADAPT IT OR
HE'LL SAY IT WAS
FOR THE GARAGE

OR HE'LL BUY SOMETHING
ELSE TO STICK ON IT

OR HE'LL START USING
IT FOR SOMETHING

IT WASN'T EVER
INTENDED TO DO.

BREAKS AND IT
GETS ADDED

A BETTER HOME LIFE
THAN I DID, RED.

WELL, WHAT ABOUT
YOUR MOTHER?

102
00:04:35,574 --> 00:04:37,943
TELL US ABOUT YOUR MOTHER.
THAT'LL BE GOOD.

103
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:40,212
NOT REALLY MUCH
TO SAY THERE.

104
00:04:40,212 --> 00:04:41,947
NOT MUCH TO TELL YOU.

105
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:43,549
I MEAN, SHE WAS

106
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:45,885
YEAH.
YEAH.

107
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,954
BUT SHE DIDN'T DRIVE.

108
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:53,659
WELL, IF BUSTER HADFIELD'S
BROTHER IS MAKING THAT
BIG CONVEYER BELT,

109
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:55,461
I THOUGHT I WOULD TAKE
THE HANDYMAN CORNER

110
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,663
TO SHOW YOU HOW
TO MAKE A SMALL
CONVEYER BELT,

111
00:04:57,663 --> 00:05:00,132
ONE THAT YOU CAN
USE RIGHT INSIDE
YOUR HOUSE.

112
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:02,167
WHETHER IT BE TO
BRING SNACKS FROM
THE KITCHEN

113
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:03,869
ALL THE WAY OVER TO
YOUR RECLINER/ROCKER

114
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:05,404
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO
GET UP OFF YOUR DUFF

115
00:05:05,404 --> 00:05:07,239
AND MISS YOUR FAVOURITE
COMMERCIALS

116
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:09,675
OR MAYBE TO USE TO BRING
LAUNDRY UP FROM
THE BASEMENT

117
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:12,578
OR EVEN TO HAUL YOURSELF
UP TO BED ON THOSE
ODD OCCASIONS

118
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:15,581
WHEN YOU'RE OVERSERVED IN
THE BREWED BEVERAGES
DEPARTMENT.

119
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,316
ALL RIGHT.
NOW THE FIRST THING
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED

120
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:20,486
TO MAKE A CONVEYER BELT
IS A PIECE OF A
CONVEYER BELT.

121
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:25,591
AND WHERE YOU GET THAT
IS YOU CUT A PIECE
OFF A CONVEYER BELT.

122
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,559
NOW IF YOU DON'T HAPPEN
TO HAVE A CONVEYER BELT,

123
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:30,095
I TELL YOU WHAT, THEY
USE A LOT OF THESE AT
THE CONSTRUCTION SITES.

124
00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:31,664
AND HERE'S ANOTHER CLUE,

125
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:35,734
THEY DON'T USUALLY
WORK ON A SUNDAY 'CAUSE
THERE'S NO TRAFFIC TO BLOCK.

126
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:37,770
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
SOMETHING TO PUT THE
CONVEYER BELT ON,

127
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,304
IT'S GOTTA SLIDE
OVER SOMETHING.

128
00:05:39,304 --> 00:05:42,975
SO YOU GET ONE OF
THESE OLD WOODEN LADDERS
WITH THE ROUND WRUNGS

129
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,510
SO THE BELT CAN
SLIDE OVER EASILY,

130
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,446
JUST LIKE YOU SLIDE 'ER
DOWN EASILY WHEN YOU
COME DOWN BY SURPRISE.

131
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:49,048
IT WILL WORK PERFECTLY.

132
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,617
NOW, YOU'LL
NEED SOMETHING TO
ACTUALLY DRIVE THE BELT.

133
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,452
I WOULD SUGGEST
YOU USE ONE OF
THE OLD WRINGERS.

134
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:54,987
REMEMBER THE OLD
WRINGER WASHER?

135
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:57,089
ON A SATURDAY MORNING,
MOM WOULD BE DOWN THE
BASEMENT THERE,

136
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:59,792
RUNNING YOUR DAD'S
SHIRT AND YOUR DAD'S
PERSONALITY

137
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,261
THROUGH THE WRINGER
ALL AT THE SAME TIME.

138
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,129
NOW, OF COURSE, YOU
GOT TO HAVE AN
ELECTRIC MOTOR

139
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:06,398
IN THERE TO DRIVE
THAT WHOLE RIG.

140
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:09,601
YOU COULD USE THE NORMAL
ELECTRIC MOTOR OFF THE
MACHINE ITSELF,

141
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:11,737
IF YOU'RE A WUSS.

142
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:17,843
BUT IF YOU'RE A REAL
MAN, HOW ABOUT ONE OF
THOSE BABIES, HUH?

143
00:06:17,843 --> 00:06:19,411
THIS HERE IS THE
ELECTRIC MOTOR

144
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:20,846
OFF THE SWING
BRIDGE IN TOWN

145
00:06:20,846 --> 00:06:23,248
OR AT LEAST IT USED
TO BE UNTIL, WELL,

146
00:06:23,248 --> 00:06:25,284
UNTIL THEY
WEREN'T LOOKING.

147
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:26,718
SOMETIMES WHEN
YOU'RE A HANDYMAN,

148
00:06:26,718 --> 00:06:29,087
YOU HAVE TO MAKE
EXECUTIVE DECISIONS.

149
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:30,656
ANYWAY, WITH THE SWING
BRIDGE NOT WORKING,

150
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,691
THAT JUST MEANS THERE'S
NO SAILBOATS ON
POSSUM LAKE,

151
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:34,826
SO IT'S GOOD FOR
THE COMMUNITY.

152
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:36,495
ALL RIGHT.
TALK IS CHEAP.

153
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:38,730
LET'S BUILD.

154
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,132
ALL RIGHT, I GOT
THE CONVEYER BELT

155
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:41,733
ALL LAID OUT AROUND
THE LADDER HERE

156
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:43,569
AND I GOT HER UP AND
THROUGH MY WRINGER

157
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,304
AND THEN I GOT THE
WRINGER HOOKED UP
WITH A DRIVE BELT

158
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:48,607
DOWN TO MY BIGGIE
SUPER DUPER HUNKIS
DORIS ELECTRIC MOTOR.

159
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:50,876
AND I WASN'T QUITE
SURE HOW FAST THIS
MOTOR WOULD GO

160
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:54,913
'CAUSE I KNOW
SHE DEVELOPS 20
HORSEPOWER AT 1750 RPM

161
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:56,748
AND THEN THE BELT, OF
COURSE, IS 18-FEET LONG,

162
00:06:56,748 --> 00:07:01,353
SO IT TURNS OUT TO
BE PRETTY DARN FAST.

163
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:02,688
SO I THOUGHT I
WOULD HOOK HER UP

164
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,823
TO A 250 WATT
LIGHT DIMMER HERE.

165
00:07:04,823 --> 00:07:07,793
SURE IT COSTS FIVE BUCKS
BUT I DON'T SCRIMP
ON SAFETY,

166
00:07:07,793 --> 00:07:10,062
UNLESS IT'S
LIKE 10 BUCKS.

167
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:14,032
ANOTHER PROBLEM I HAD
IS THAT THE MOTOR
RUNS ON 550 VOLTS

168
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:17,269
WHEREAS AT THE LODGE
HERE WE ONLY HAVE 110
VOLTS ON THE GOOD DAYS,

169
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:19,071
WHICH IS ONLY
ONE-FIFTH.

170
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:22,874
I SOLVED THAT ONE EASY
ENOUGH, I JUST ADDED
FIVE PLUGS ON TO THE --

171
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:27,045
TWO, THREE --
ANYWAY THE FIFTH
PLUG HERE

172
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:29,114
AND FIVE PLUGS ONTO
THE MOTOR AND THAT
WAY SHE ALL WORKS OUT.

173
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:30,582
NOW, LET'S SAY I
WANTED TO TAKE
THIS BOX

174
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:32,284
OF CANDIES AND
JELLY DONUTS

175
00:07:32,284 --> 00:07:36,088
AND ASSORTED THINGS
THAT I LIKE TO
SNACK ON

176
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:40,492
AND I WANTED TO MOVE
THIS INTO ANOTHER ROOM.

177
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:43,061
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS
STICK HER ON
MY CONVEYOR

178
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:49,601
AND GRAB MY DIMMER
AND JUST TURN HER
ON AND GIVE HER A SHOT.

179
00:07:50,602 --> 00:07:55,974
I GUESS SHE NEEDS
A LITTLE MORE JUICE.

180
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:58,910
MAYBE THOSE JELLY DONUTS
ARE HEAVIER THAN I
THOUGHT THEY WERE.

181
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,812
WHY DON'T WE OPEN
HER WIDE OPEN?

182
00:08:00,812 --> 00:08:04,115
OH, NO, WAIT A SEC,
THERE'S THE PROBLEM,

183
00:08:04,115 --> 00:08:06,251
THE BELT IS CAUGHT
IN THE WRINGER, HERE.

184
00:08:06,251 --> 00:08:09,955
WOAH!

185
00:08:11,957 --> 00:08:13,225
WELL, THAT WORKED GREAT.

186
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:17,162
DID I SAY CONVEYER BELT?
I MEANT CATAPULT.

187
00:08:17,162 --> 00:08:18,730
REMEMBER, IF WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

188
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,433
THEY SHOULD AT
LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

189
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:24,836
I HOPE THE NEIGHBOURS
ENJOY THOSE TREATS.

190
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:26,238
RED GREEN:
STAY TUNED.

191
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:28,039
BILL IS GOING TO
STRETCH HIMSELF
TO THE LIMIT

192
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:29,441
AND GLEN AND I ARE
GOING TO SHOW YOU

193
00:08:29,441 --> 00:08:32,010
WHY FAT GUYS
SHOULDN'T DO STUFF.

194
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:37,349
YOU KNOW A LOT
OF PEOPLE MY AGE
DON'T LIKE RAP MUSIC.

195
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:40,218
THEY SAY RAP MUSIC
ISN'T MUSIC

196
00:08:40,218 --> 00:08:41,753
IT'S NOT EVEN POETRY.

197
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:44,022
IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF
PEOPLE TAKING REVENGE
ON THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE

198
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:46,925
BY TURNING IT
INTO A SET OF DRUMS.

199
00:08:46,925 --> 00:08:48,893
AND THE RAPPERS HAVE
KIND OF STRANGE
NAMES, YOU KNOW,

200
00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:51,896
LIKE ICE BUCKET
OR ZAP ZIPPER.

201
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:55,433
BUT I LIKE RAP
MUSIC BECAUSE YOU DON'T
NEED ANY TALENT, YOU SEE.

202
00:08:55,433 --> 00:08:57,435
THIS IS SOMETHING
I CAN DO.

203
00:08:57,435 --> 00:09:00,505
I COULD MAKE THOSE
FINGER MOTIONS AT
THE CAMERA

204
00:09:00,505 --> 00:09:03,208
WHILE I'M CHANTING
DIRTY LIMERICKS TO
SOME METRONOME.

205
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,943
AND I CAN HIRE
UNDERDRESSED GROUPIES,

206
00:09:04,943 --> 00:09:06,344
SLITHERING AWAY IN
THE BACKGROUND THERE,

207
00:09:06,344 --> 00:09:09,280
FEELING THEIR BODIES
LIKE THEY'RE CHECKING
FOR MOLES.

208
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,715
I COULD EVEN
CHANGE MY NAME,

209
00:09:10,715 --> 00:09:16,955
CALL MYSELF ICE GREEN
OR MASTER RED DEF
JAM OR EXCUSE-E-ME.

210
00:09:16,955 --> 00:09:27,232
I COULD BE HUGE.
NOT GOOD, BUT HUGE.

211
00:09:27,232 --> 00:09:31,503
WELL, WE GOT BUSTER'S
BIG CONVEYER BELT
ALL PUT TOGETHER.

212
00:09:31,503 --> 00:09:36,040
AND YOU SHOULD HAVE
SEEN HOW DIRTY SOME
OF THE GUYS GOT.

213
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,879
UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE
NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

214
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:43,415
YOU SHOULD NOT
BE PUTTING THAT
THING TOGETHER.

215
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:45,583
OH, HAROLD, IF YOUR
PARENTS HAD ANY IDEA
WHAT THEY WERE DOING,

216
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:49,854
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE PUT
YOU TOGETHER EITHER.

217
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:52,457
ANYWAY, BUSTER AND
HIS BROTHER HAVE NOW

218
00:09:52,457 --> 00:09:54,859
ESTABLISHED A 12-MILE
STRIP OF MOVING RUBBER

219
00:09:54,859 --> 00:09:57,629
RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE
OF POSSUM COUNTY.

220
00:09:57,629 --> 00:09:59,497
WHAT AN EYE SORE.

221
00:09:59,497 --> 00:10:02,500
AND AROUND HERE
THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING.

222
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,005
HAROLD, ONE MAN'S EYE
SORE IS ANOTHER
MAN'S MONORAIL.

223
00:10:07,005 --> 00:10:08,573
MONORAIL?

224
00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:11,409
THE HADFIELD
RUBBER ROCKET.

225
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:13,411
THEY'RE GOING TO USE
IT TO REPLACE THE
SCHOOL BUS.

226
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:17,682
EVERYBODY JUST THROWS
THEIR KIDS ON THE BELT
AND OFF THEY GO.

227
00:10:17,682 --> 00:10:19,517
THE PROBLEM IS THERE'S
NO REVERSE ON
THE MOTOR,

228
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:21,786
SO THE KIDS WILL
HAVE TO WALK HOME.

229
00:10:21,786 --> 00:10:24,689
UNLESS YOU MAKE
IT PART OF THE
PHYSICAL FITNESS TRAINING.

230
00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:26,524
YOU KNOW BECAUSE I
BET IT WOULD BE
GOOD EXERCISE

231
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:27,792
FOR THE KIDS TO
TRY TO WALK HOME

232
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:29,193
AGAINST THE TREADMILL
GOING THE OTHER WAY,

233
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:31,129
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW
THEY TRAIN ASTRONAUTS
AND STUFF, YOU KNOW,

234
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:35,033
SO THEY'RE OKAY
IN MALLS AND THAT.

235
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:37,602
WELL, I SUPPOSE IF
THEY GOT THE MOTOR
GOING SLOW ENOUGH

236
00:10:37,602 --> 00:10:39,537
SO THE KIDS COULD
MAKE HEADWAY WITHOUT
BURNING THE BOTTOMS

237
00:10:39,537 --> 00:10:41,506
OUT OF THEIR
PF FLYERS.

238
00:10:41,506 --> 00:10:43,041
BECAUSE YOU KNOW
IF THEY SLIP UP,

239
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:46,044
THEY'RE GOING
RIGHT BACK TO SCHOOL.

240
00:10:46,044 --> 00:10:47,278
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

241
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:51,783
I WAS IN GRADE FOUR
THREE YEARS IN A ROW.

242
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:56,087
AND HERE WE ARE AT
BRACKSTON'S MARINA
WITH GLEN BRACKSTON.

243
00:10:56,087 --> 00:10:57,388
HOW ARE YOU TODAY, GLEN?

244
00:10:57,388 --> 00:10:59,190
I'M FINE, RED.
GREAT.

245
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,925
THAT WAS JUST
A FALSE ALARM.

246
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:02,293
JUST A LITTLE
TOUCH OF ANGINA.

247
00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:05,797
SO OFFICIALLY I'VE
STILL ONLY HAD TWO
HEART ATTACKS.

248
00:11:05,797 --> 00:11:07,632
TODAY'S BOATING TIP:

249
00:11:07,632 --> 00:11:11,235
TODAY WE'RE GOING
TO PRESERVE THE
FINISH ON A BOAT.

250
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:14,739
SO WHAT YOU NEED
IS A HIGH QUALITY
POLYMER RESIN WAX

251
00:11:14,739 --> 00:11:17,175
AND A DAMP,
CLEAN CLOTH.

252
00:11:17,175 --> 00:11:19,077
MORE DAMP
THAN CLEAN.

253
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:24,615
SO WE GOT TO --
HOP UP HERE RED.

254
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:31,622
NOW WHAT WE
GOT TO DO

255
00:11:31,622 --> 00:11:36,627
IS GET A LITTLE OF THE
RESIN ON THE CLEAN
HERE -- WELL,

256
00:11:36,627 --> 00:11:39,330
THERE YOU GO, RED,
MAYBE YOU'D LIKE
TO DO IT.

257
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,698
YOU CAN LEARN
BY DOING.

258
00:11:40,698 --> 00:11:42,600
NO, IT'S OKAY.
I DON'T LEARN BY DOING.

259
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,968
YOU GO AHEAD, GLEN.

260
00:11:43,968 --> 00:11:45,336
OKAY, SURE.
I GUESS I COULD DO IT.

261
00:11:45,336 --> 00:11:47,104
MAYBE YOU
COULD RUN OUT

262
00:11:47,104 --> 00:11:50,575
AND GRAB MY NITRO PILLS
FOR ME IN THE BOATHOUSE.

263
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:52,343
ALL RIGHT.

264
00:11:52,343 --> 00:11:54,345
SO WHAT YOU NEED
TO DO IS SOME

265
00:11:54,345 --> 00:11:56,514
NICE BIG
CIRCULAR MOTIONS.

266
00:11:56,514 --> 00:11:59,951
AND WHEN IT DRIES THEN
YOU TAKE IT OFF WITH
A CLEAN RAG.

267
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:03,354
A CLEANER RAG.

268
00:12:03,354 --> 00:12:05,223
HOW DID YOU LEARN
ABOUT THIS STUFF GLEN?

269
00:12:05,223 --> 00:12:06,724
NOT BY DOING,
OBVIOUSLY.

270
00:12:06,724 --> 00:12:08,226
OH, NO, BY
WATCHING RED.

271
00:12:08,226 --> 00:12:10,494
I ONLY WISH I COULD
LEARN BY DOING BUT MY
HEALTH PREVENTS THAT.

272
00:12:10,494 --> 00:12:13,531
I FIND MY LOT IN LIFE
IS JUST GIVING ADVICE,
YOU KNOW.

273
00:12:13,531 --> 00:12:16,734
LIKE YOU GUYS WITH
YOUR CONVEYOR SCHOOL
BUS RIG THERE.

274
00:12:16,734 --> 00:12:19,437
YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU GUYS
MIGHT WANT TO TRY THAT
OUT ON YOURSELVES

275
00:12:19,437 --> 00:12:21,606
BEFORE YOU GET ANY OF
MY KIDS ON THERE.

276
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:23,541
OH, YEAH, WE DON'T
WANT ALL SEVEN OF
YOUR DAUGHTERS

277
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:26,510
ON THERE AT THE
ONE TIME ANYWAY,
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

278
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,713
IS THAT SOME SORT
OF FAT SHOT, RED,
THEY'RE HEAVY?

279
00:12:28,713 --> 00:12:30,147
OH, NO, NO,
NO, NO.

280
00:12:30,147 --> 00:12:32,450
WHAT I MEANT WAS
WE DON'T WANT YOU
ALL STRESSED OUT,

281
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,418
YOU KNOW, HAVING ALL
YOUR KIDS AT RISK.

282
00:12:34,418 --> 00:12:36,187
OKAY.
I THINK THAT'S
PRETTY WELL GOT HER.

283
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:37,755
THAT WAS GREAT.
THAT'S A GREAT
DEMONSTRATION.

284
00:12:37,755 --> 00:12:39,090
THANK YOU VERY
MUCH, GLEN.

285
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,292
OH, RED, YOU NEED
TO FINISH IT UP, RED.

286
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:42,960
I PROMISED A GUY
I WOULD HAVE IT
DONE BY TWO O'CLOCK.

287
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,662
YOU DON'T MIND,
DO YOU?

288
00:12:44,662 --> 00:12:46,297
YEAH, I DO MIND.
I GOT THINGS TO DO.
SORRY, GLEN.

289
00:12:46,297 --> 00:12:49,133
WELL, SURE, I GUESS
I CAN DO IT MYSELF.

290
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:53,237
I JUST HOPE
IT'S NOT THE LAST
THING I EVER DO.

291
00:12:53,237 --> 00:12:55,573
OH, ALL RIGHT.

292
00:12:55,573 --> 00:13:00,611
CAN I GET YOU A DONUT
OR SOMETHING RED?

293
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,652
IT'S MAIL CALL.

294
00:13:10,087 --> 00:13:11,622
THIS WEEK WE GOT A
REALLY NEAT LETTER IN.

295
00:13:11,622 --> 00:13:12,723
LOOK AT THIS ONE
UNCLE RED,

296
00:13:12,723 --> 00:13:14,458
IT'S ALL ART
ON THERE AND SOME
DESIGNS AND STUFF.

297
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:15,993
IT'S NEAT.
OH BOY.
OH BOY.

298
00:13:15,993 --> 00:13:19,029
YOU KNOW HAROLD I WANTED
TO BE A STRUGGLING
ARTIST AT ONE TIME

299
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:21,966
BUT I JUST COULDN'T PUT
UP WITH THE BAHAMIAN
LIFESTYLE.

300
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:24,068
THAT'S BOHEMIAN
LIFESTYLE, UNCLE RED.

301
00:13:24,068 --> 00:13:25,636
BOHEMIAN.
WHATEVER.

302
00:13:25,636 --> 00:13:27,805
YOU KNOW I WANTED
TO DO THAT BUT BOY

303
00:13:27,805 --> 00:13:32,543
I SEE THE WAY THEY
LIVE AND THE FILTH,
YOU KNOW,

304
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,245
AND THE BUGS
AND THE RATS

305
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:36,547
AND NOTHING TO WEAR,
PENNILESS, HUNGRY
ALL THE TIME.

306
00:13:36,547 --> 00:13:38,916
NO THANK YOU.

307
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:43,120
WELL THAT'S HOW
YOU LIVE NOW.

308
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,356
NO, HAROLD, I'M NOT
HUNGRY ALL THE
TIME, YOU KNOW.

309
00:13:45,356 --> 00:13:47,625
I WAS REAL SERIOUS
ABOUT BEING ARTIST.

310
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,493
I GOT A BERET
AND THE WHOLE --

311
00:13:49,493 --> 00:13:52,696
BUT, AGAIN, AS I SAY,
I COULDN'T PUT UP WITH
THE BULGARIAN LIFESTYLE.

312
00:13:52,696 --> 00:13:54,732
BOHEMIAN.
YEAH, WELL, WHATEVER.

313
00:13:54,732 --> 00:13:56,534
I SETTLED DOWN AND GOT
MYSELF MARRIED, HAROLD.

314
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:58,369
WELL, I WAS GOING
TO BE AN ARTIST, TOO.

315
00:13:58,369 --> 00:14:01,338
YEAH, I TOOK ONE OF
THOSE LIFE DRAWING
CLASSES,

316
00:14:01,338 --> 00:14:04,441
YOU KNOW, WHERE
YOU DRAW LIFE,
YOU KNOW.

317
00:14:04,441 --> 00:14:07,678
THERE'S JUST LIKE
LIFE FIGURES AND
YOU DRAW THEM.

318
00:14:07,678 --> 00:14:11,081
NUDES, HAROLD?
EXACTLY.

319
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:15,753
THEY HAD A NUDE MODEL
COME IN ALL NAKED.

320
00:14:15,753 --> 00:14:19,623
I GOT SO NERVOUS I
SHARPENED MY CRAYON
RIGHT DOWN TO A NUB

321
00:14:19,623 --> 00:14:22,493
AND I SWALLOWED
MY ERASER.

322
00:14:22,493 --> 00:14:25,663
THE MODEL HAD TO COME
RUNNING OVER AND GAVE
ME A HEIMLICH MANEUVER.

323
00:14:25,663 --> 00:14:27,431
SAVED MY LIFE.

324
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:30,434
AND DID THIS NUDE MODEL
GIVE YOU MOUTH-TO-MOUTH
RESUSCITATION?

325
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:33,170
WELL, HE WANTED TO.

326
00:14:37,308 --> 00:14:39,943
RED GREEN: IT'S TIME FOR
ADVENTURES WITH BILL.

327
00:14:39,943 --> 00:14:42,379
BILL HAD SOMETHING
KIND OF MODERN ON
HIS MIND TODAY.

328
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:43,714
GOT TO GET
HIMSELF INTO SHAPE.

329
00:14:43,714 --> 00:14:45,315
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
DOING THIS THESE DAYS.

330
00:14:45,315 --> 00:14:47,184
AND WE'RE GOING TO
SHOW YOU IT DOESN'T
TAKE A THOUSAND DOLLARS

331
00:14:47,184 --> 00:14:48,419
AND AN ARM
AND A LEG.

332
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:50,254
WELL, IT MIGHT TAKE
AN ARM AND A LEG.

333
00:14:50,254 --> 00:14:52,823
HE WANTED ME TO
PUT THE GAS CANS A
CERTAIN WAY THERE.

334
00:14:52,823 --> 00:14:55,325
AND THAT ONE WAS FULL
AND THIS ONE HAD VERY
LITTLE IN IT AT ALL,

335
00:14:55,325 --> 00:14:57,394
WHICH SEEMED ODD TO ME,
BUT, YOU KNOW, I
DON'T QUESTION,

336
00:14:57,394 --> 00:14:58,996
BILL'S THE EXPERT.

337
00:14:58,996 --> 00:15:00,464
AND HE PUTS THE BAR
THROUGH THERE, A LITTLE
PIECE OF ANGLE IRON.

338
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:02,466
AND THEN HE'S GOING
TO CHALK DOWN.

339
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:03,700
THAT'S NOT CHALK, BILL.

340
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,437
BILL, THAT'S NOT --
BILL, THAT'S NOT CHALK.

341
00:15:06,437 --> 00:15:10,140
THIS IS WHAT I
THOUGHT WOULD HAPPEN.

342
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,609
LOOKS LIKE HE --
GOOD THINKING, BILL.

343
00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:13,877
YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, GREAT.

344
00:15:13,877 --> 00:15:16,046
BILL THAT'S NOT --
BILL THERE'S A FLAME.

345
00:15:16,046 --> 00:15:18,515
BILL.
BILL.

346
00:15:18,515 --> 00:15:21,652
HE'LL BE BACK IN
A MINUTE I GUESS.

347
00:15:21,652 --> 00:15:25,222
THERE HE IS.

348
00:15:25,222 --> 00:15:26,990
THAT WILL BE QUITE
A BIT LATER NOW.

349
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,993
YEAH, HE'S FINE.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

350
00:15:29,993 --> 00:15:32,296
GETTING ALL KINDS
OF EXERCISE TODAY.

351
00:15:32,296 --> 00:15:35,365
NOW HE TAKES OUR
MANURE SPREADER, HERE.

352
00:15:35,365 --> 00:15:37,701
HE'S GOT THE LITTLE
LIKE SURGICAL TUBING.

353
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:39,336
THE KIND OF SOMETHING
USED TO REPLACE

354
00:15:39,336 --> 00:15:41,171
THINGS INSIDE YOUR BODY
THAT LOOK LIKE THAT.

355
00:15:41,171 --> 00:15:44,041
AND HE -- OH, OH, OH.

356
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,910
YOU KNOW SOMETIMES
IN LIFE YOU CAN
LOOK AROUND

357
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,912
AND YOU CAN SEE AN
ACCIDENT ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

358
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:50,514
YOU JUST KNOW THERE'S
GOING TO BE TROUBLE,

359
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:52,082
YOU DON'T KNOW
EXACTLY WHEN,

360
00:15:52,082 --> 00:15:54,251
BUT YOU CERTAINLY KNOW
WHAT IT'S GOING TO
BE, DON'T YOU?

361
00:15:54,251 --> 00:15:57,654
YEAH, THAT'S THE
ONE I PICTURED.

362
00:15:57,654 --> 00:15:59,256
AWAY YOU GO BILL.

363
00:15:59,256 --> 00:16:00,824
EVERYTHING IS EXERCISE
WITH BILL.

364
00:16:00,824 --> 00:16:04,861
LOOK WHERE HE'S
WEARING THE HARD HAT NOW.

365
00:16:04,861 --> 00:16:06,630
AND HE'S GOTTEN EVERYTHING
EXERCISED ALL AT ONCE.

366
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,398
AND THEN HE'S GOT
THIS KIND OF A BOXING THING

367
00:16:08,398 --> 00:16:09,833
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS
KIND OF NEAT,

368
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,835
KIND OF LIKE MOHAMMED
ALI, GEORGE FRASER-
TYPE OF THING.

369
00:16:11,835 --> 00:16:14,271
HE'S GOING TO LEAN
AGAINST AND THROW
THE PUNCHES.

370
00:16:14,271 --> 00:16:17,608
BUT THE DOORKNOB MAYBE
IS NOT AS ATTACHED
JUST QUITE AS WELL.

371
00:16:17,608 --> 00:16:19,943
SOME OF THE THINGS AT
THE LODGE ARE REALLY
NOT UP TO SPEC.

372
00:16:19,943 --> 00:16:21,745
I DON'T THINK COMPARED
TO WHAT -- UH-OH,

373
00:16:21,745 --> 00:16:26,316
UH-OH, UH-OH, UH-OH, UH-OH,
UH-OH, UH-OH, UH-OH.

374
00:16:26,316 --> 00:16:28,685
THAT'S MY VAN, BILL.

375
00:16:28,685 --> 00:16:30,754
NOBODY MESSES
WITH MY VAN.

376
00:16:30,754 --> 00:16:32,823
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
EXERCISE, RIGHT?

377
00:16:32,823 --> 00:16:36,193
WELL I HAVE GOOD NEWS,
I CAN HELP YOU
WITH THAT.

378
00:16:36,193 --> 00:16:40,630
WATCH YOURSELF ON
THE BUILDING THERE.

379
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,299
RED GREEN:
STAY TUNED.

380
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:44,201
HAROLD'S GOT A COUPLE
MORE STUPID THINGS
TO SAY

381
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:46,103
AND DALTON HUMPHREY
GETS EXCITED

382
00:16:46,103 --> 00:16:48,705
SO YOU KNOW THERE'S
MONEY INVOLVED.

383
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:57,114
[ LAUGHTER ]

384
00:16:59,182 --> 00:17:01,318
WELL, WE HAD A LITTLE
TROUBLE WITH BUSTER
HADFIELD'S

385
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:04,254
MOVING CONVEYER
BELT THING.

386
00:17:04,254 --> 00:17:08,024
OH REALLY?

387
00:17:08,024 --> 00:17:09,693
EVERYTHING WAS
FINE, YOU KNOW,

388
00:17:09,693 --> 00:17:11,495
THE BUNCH OF US WERE
SITTING ON THERE
READY TO GO

389
00:17:11,495 --> 00:17:13,230
AND MOOSE THOMPSON
THROWS THE POWER SWITCH

390
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:17,134
AND THEN HE DECIDES
HE WANTS TO GET
ON IT TOO.

391
00:17:17,134 --> 00:17:23,273
I'M GUESSING
BAD DECISION?

392
00:17:23,273 --> 00:17:25,242
WELL, IT WOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN TOO BAD IF HE
JUST CLIMBED ON.

393
00:17:25,242 --> 00:17:26,810
BUT, OH NO,
NOT MOOSE,

394
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:29,679
HE'S GOT TO DO ONE OF
THESE FLYING SUMMERSAULT
CANNONBALL THINGS.

395
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,248
A HALF GAINER.

396
00:17:31,248 --> 00:17:34,451
A TOTAL LOSER.

397
00:17:34,451 --> 00:17:37,254
THE WHOLE CONVEYER
BELT CRASHES TO
THE GROUND

398
00:17:37,254 --> 00:17:39,489
AND CHANGES FROM A
MOVING CONVEYER

399
00:17:39,489 --> 00:17:42,192
INTO KIND OF LIKE
A TANK TREAD.

400
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:43,660
BUT WITHOUT THE TANK.

401
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,129
WELL, WE HAD MOOSE.

402
00:17:46,129 --> 00:17:48,932
SO NOW YOU GOT A 12-MILE
BLACK ELASTIC BAND,

403
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:50,533
COVERED WITH HUMANITY,

404
00:17:50,533 --> 00:17:54,604
POWERED BY A DIESEL
ENGINE HEADING SOUTH.

405
00:17:54,604 --> 00:17:57,774
SOUTH.
NOW, SOUTH, THAT --
I CAN'T PICTURE THAT.

406
00:17:57,774 --> 00:18:01,311
WHAT IS THAT
TOWARDS?
WELL, THIS DOOR.

407
00:18:01,311 --> 00:18:05,081
YEAH.
AND THE BARN AROUND IT.

408
00:18:05,081 --> 00:18:07,584
THAT'S FARMER
ASHLEY'S SHEEP FARM.

409
00:18:07,584 --> 00:18:08,985
ARE THE SHEEP OKAY?

410
00:18:08,985 --> 00:18:10,420
NO, THE SHEEP ARE
FINE, THEY HEADED NORTH.

411
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,821
BUT YOU MIGHT WANT
TO AIR OUT YOUR ROOM,

412
00:18:11,821 --> 00:18:15,592
THEY WERE
PRETTY SCARED.

413
00:18:17,294 --> 00:18:19,996
WE'RE OUT HERE BY
THE MAIN HIGHWAY AT
HUMPHREY'S EVERYTHING STORE

414
00:18:19,996 --> 00:18:22,132

415
00:18:22,132 --> 00:18:26,002
FROM THE STORE OWNER,
DALTON HUMPHREY.

416
00:18:26,002 --> 00:18:28,672
YOU CAN ACTUALLY MAKE
MONEY WITH THIS STUFF,
CAN YOU DALTON?

417
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:31,174
WELL, YOU KNOW, RED,

ON ANTIQUES.

419
00:18:34,144 --> 00:18:35,679
ALL RIGHT.

420
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,180
FOR INSTANCE,

423
00:18:42,085 --> 00:18:45,855
TO HIM IT WAS JUST
A DIRTY OLD RUSTED

424
00:18:45,855 --> 00:18:48,725
BUT, YOU KNOW, TO

WOULD BE WORTH
TO THEM.

429
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,670
WELL, BY GOSH, IT MUST
BE WORTH 50 BUCKS AT
LEAST I WOULD THINK.

430
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,906
