1
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:42,976
If the show they said they couldn't be done,
here's the show they said shouldn't be done.

2
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:45,078
Here's the show they said wouldn't be done.

3
00:00:45,778 --> 00:00:48,648
Here we are because they're only obviously
right about the shouldn't part.

4
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:52,619
We're broadcasting from the north, the real
far north, where most people don't go.

5
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:55,021
You know that really a hard place to get
out, like when you're in the middle of your

6
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:58,057
back or you. But anyway, that's where we're
coming from.

7
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:01,728
And here's the star of the show, the man who
signs the checks around here, and he's in no

8
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:02,962
danger of getting writer's cramp.

9
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:07,100
Believe me, you hear he is the star of the
show and my uncle by birth and marriage in

10
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,768
that order, ladies and gentlemen, Mr.

11
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:09,769
Red Green.

12
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:15,141
Thank you and welcome to Possum Lodge.

13
00:01:15,174 --> 00:01:20,146
I'm going to be your guide for the mysteries
of nature like the lodgepole pine tree, the

14
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,482
white rump antelope and and my nephew Harold
here.

15
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:26,753
And when people get tired of that real nature
stuff, I can just throw in a little pizzazz.

16
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:30,256
Wow. Why do you do that, Harold?

17
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:34,961
Well, it's because it says right on my resume
that every show I promise to deliver a bunch

18
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:35,595
of pizzazz.

19
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:37,297
I thought it said pizza's.

20
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:42,101
I'm a television producer, what would I
possibly know about pizzas?

21
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:43,870
Try looking in the mirror sometime, Harold.

22
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:48,841
Anyway, we got a real, fun filled show for
you this week, I mean, it looks good on

23
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:50,743
paper. Then again, so did Harold's resume.

24
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,114
Actually, we almost didn't have didn't have
a show at all because a bunch of us last

25
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:57,050
night got playing. Sorry, I like him.

26
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,584
Oh, that's a good game. I like the game with
story.

27
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,186
That's a great board game. That one.

28
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:03,189
I hope they put it out with computer one
day, because then maybe I could play it too.

29
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,191
No, no. This is a different story.

30
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,192
This is Possum Lodge.

31
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:10,496
Sorry, the way this works is that you've got
to get up and do something that you're going

32
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:11,898
to be sorry for when you sober up.

33
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:17,103
Actually, Buster Hatfield won with his
eggnog nostril shower.

34
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:21,340
You know, I think what it is is he takes
down two full bags of milk and he actually

35
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,508
swallows the eggs in the shells.

36
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,410
That's what makes it such a consistent
winner.

37
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:29,682
Once he won that, we all, of course, had to
go down to the lake and watch the bits of nog

38
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:32,785
and egg and the eggnog even together off of
our southern.

39
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:37,190
Well, once we'd finished belly flop on our
coast, Clean Moose Thompson started the big

40
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,458
fire in the den and so we could all get
dried off

41
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:42,829
In the den. There's no fireplace in the den.

42
00:02:43,262 --> 00:02:45,498
No, no. That's that's why we almost didn't
have a show.

43
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,200
Set the floor on fire.

44
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,502
That was that like smoky stench is in here
today.

45
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,905
No, no, no. That's that's from stinky
Peterson's long johns.

46
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:55,208
We use them to put out the fire.

47
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,376
Let's think pretty upset about it.

48
00:02:57,376 --> 00:03:01,480
I guess we should have taken them off him
first rather than stinky, then burnt to a

49
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,950
crisp in the den being total, it's really no
harm done.

50
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:07,520
So without further ado, let's get the show
rolling, Harold.

51
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,728
Jen, at the end, I hate cards.

52
00:03:16,495 --> 00:03:19,532
In Old Harold, Golf would be a perfect game
for you.

53
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:20,900
I could teach you.

54
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:23,336
Yeah, I carry the three this time.

55
00:03:23,402 --> 00:03:24,603
No, thank you, though, Bob.

56
00:03:24,603 --> 00:03:26,339
I can't throw the clubs as far as you can.

57
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:28,808
That's not on purpose.

58
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:30,509
That's all accidental.

59
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,380
Besides, if I was on the pro circuit, I
could afford better grips.

60
00:03:35,147 --> 00:03:37,817
Well, actually, my time is very limited right
now at my all.

61
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,318
My career is also demanding.

62
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:41,420
I got to roll up cable, burned myself on
lights.

63
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:45,358
Things to do. Got five hundred.

64
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,459
You win again, Bill.

65
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:52,565
It all, Harold. That's why I work for the
Department of Natural Resources.

66
00:03:52,898 --> 00:03:55,601
I'm able to combine my work with my hobbies.

67
00:03:56,368 --> 00:03:58,270
You know, you play your cards, right?

68
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,373
I might be able to get you a job with the
department too and leave show

69
00:04:01,373 --> 00:04:03,743
Business, huh?

70
00:04:04,543 --> 00:04:06,011
Look what I caught today.

71
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:09,749
Basketball Hoop Possum Lake is devoid of
life.

72
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:12,351
Congratulations, Bob.

73
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:16,822
While you and your government buddies were
out dumping around the back nine, another

74
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:17,857
lake rolled over.

75
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:19,959
What do you care, right?

76
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:21,961
Just another water hazard as far as you're
concerned.

77
00:04:23,362 --> 00:04:25,998
You know, doc, you seem to be carrying a lot
of tension.

78
00:04:26,398 --> 00:04:30,536
Maybe if you got outside, got some fresh
air, maybe a little exercise might do you the

79
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:31,303
world of good.

80
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:36,642
You know, Harold, when I first started
fishing out here by the fish would jump right

81
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:38,878
up out of the lake and jump at your boot
laces.

82
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:42,882
Yeah, you ever see two people arguing over
who gets caught first?

83
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:49,288
You know, some days we'd catch so many fish
we couldn't haul them all in at the time, all

84
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:53,192
together and kind of a fish raft and float
the boat in on the fish.

85
00:04:53,225 --> 00:04:54,293
Wow.

86
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,295
With that, ever, we need to believe,

87
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,500
You know, Doug, you may think that there's no
fish in that lake, but I find it's a lot like

88
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,437
life. You know, people blame their bad
scores on the golf course.

89
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:10,943
You know, either the the greens are too
rough or the trees are too hard, or what

90
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:13,545
idiot put the first tee so close to the
parking lot.

91
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:19,051
I've been catching fish since I was two years
old, and if I don't reel in a slew of trout,

92
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:20,219
it's because they're not there.

93
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:24,289
Possum Lake's dead red bob killed it.

94
00:05:24,623 --> 00:05:26,191
Look, the lake is fine.

95
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:30,796
The problem is that in the past 15 years,
the fish have gotten smarter and dock here

96
00:05:30,796 --> 00:05:32,264
hasn't been able to keep pace.

97
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,533
You see, what are you doing today?

98
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,704
Read Well, it's not going golf, and neither
are you, Mr..

99
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,906
Not A. Get out there and fix the Dead Sea.

100
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:41,340
Yeah.

101
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,809
And who are you to tell me how to spend my
workday?

102
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,045
Well, I'm a taxpayer, aren't I?

103
00:05:46,378 --> 00:05:48,247
You are sales tax.

104
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:49,048
No.

105
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:50,883
Look, I got to be at work.

106
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,184
I've got a tee off time.

107
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:55,587
Yeah. Well, don't be surprised if your game
gets interrupted by a bunch of angry

108
00:05:55,587 --> 00:05:59,992
fishermen. We can do a lot of damage with a
hundred pounds of live bait and an attitude

109
00:06:00,225 --> 00:06:01,427
Of you stop me from golfing.

110
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,729
You will be interfering with government
business and

111
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:04,863
I'll interfere away.

112
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:06,432
Mr., won't you be touching me?

113
00:06:06,965 --> 00:06:09,368
All right. Well, listen now what are you
doing today?

114
00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:11,336
I got to go into town with the RV.

115
00:06:11,503 --> 00:06:16,208
Oh, well, when you're in town, when you buy
dog, some fish, something slow and stupid

116
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,309
that bites at anything.

117
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:20,879
It's little stupid. Yeah, yeah.

118
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:22,848
You should talk, mister. You should talk.

119
00:06:22,981 --> 00:06:28,153
Oh oh, he doesn't know what kind of a fight
I can put up when he gets his hooks in me.

120
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,390
You can quote me on that one, but go slow.

121
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,092
It's stupid. Who wants to go on a shopping
safari?

122
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:40,799
I got to get some tires all season radio.

123
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:43,802
Well, we're we're pretty booked up today.

124
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:46,104
Oh, are you sure?

125
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:47,339
I got to get six of them.

126
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:48,640
You know, I got the double wheels on the
back.

127
00:06:49,207 --> 00:06:51,410
I am. Yeah, but I have to get a seventh.

128
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,678
Actually, I need a new maybe I need new
spare.

129
00:06:53,612 --> 00:06:55,247
Well, somebody wants to come with me.

130
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:58,150
I might be able to be tucked in to getting
that new seventh tire.

131
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:02,654
Well, you don't go ahead. I think Harold
might be up for a tire trip.

132
00:07:03,155 --> 00:07:03,789
Oh yeah.

133
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:04,957
Yeah, Harold.

134
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:07,059
Yes, sir. What are you doing, son?

135
00:07:07,092 --> 00:07:07,859
Volunteer, sir?

136
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:17,069
My daddy was a poor sharecropper.

137
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:19,638
He crop things and share them.

138
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,243
We were so poor we couldn't afford windows,
but we had a door that opened a few inches.

139
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:32,984
I remember the day my daddy died, he called
me over to his side and he said, Who the hell

140
00:07:32,984 --> 00:07:35,620
are you? That was a disappointment.

141
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,465
This week, the

142
00:07:46,498 --> 00:07:51,403
Hey Man Corner, I'm going to show you how you
can turn an old piece of crap like this chair

143
00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:57,209
into a beautiful recliner rocker, you know,
to me, anything that's called a La-Z-Boy.

144
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:58,610
Sounds like my kind of furniture.

145
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:03,548
All right. The first thing we have to do is
to disconnect the back from the seat right

146
00:08:03,548 --> 00:08:05,884
down here, so we'll flop or down.

147
00:08:06,852 --> 00:08:08,086
I guess you could put this in a vise.

148
00:08:08,086 --> 00:08:09,387
If you're a purist, you know

149
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:11,056
How to talk inside.

150
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:20,799
A source very sharp, we use that one to cut
concrete blocks, we made our wet bar God,

151
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:23,034
just switch to the jigsaw.

152
00:08:25,003 --> 00:08:25,770
There's nothing to it.

153
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:37,849
There's no no bleeding that oh, I remember
now we we broke that blade when we made that

154
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:39,651
architects drafting table out of an oil
tank.

155
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,954
You got lots of power tools here.

156
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:43,521
No problem.

157
00:08:53,798 --> 00:08:59,738
All right, now, we got the back in here now,
why did I do that?

158
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:03,241
Oh, oh, oh yeah, yeah, we're making every
kind of rock for you.

159
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:08,847
So we now are going to reattach the back to
the seat with these hinges.

160
00:09:12,951 --> 00:09:17,389
And so what we have now is more of a
collapse of rocker.

161
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:20,625
And what we need to do is to now install our
foot rest.

162
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:21,693
That's going to swing up.

163
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,997
Now what you want here is a real nice piece
of wood, something that matches the grain and

164
00:09:25,997 --> 00:09:28,600
the same kind of general quality as the rest
of the chair.

165
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,138
I couldn't find one, so I'm going to use
this barbecue grill.

166
00:09:34,272 --> 00:09:38,309
I got some cuff hooks mounted underneath the
chair there, and it'll just hang on there.

167
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:44,849
And you know, you might want to scrape some
of the mung and fat and gristle and feathers

168
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:47,018
off this thing if you're going to sit in
this chair in your good pants.

169
00:09:47,819 --> 00:09:51,790
Ok, now what we need to put on here is the
supports for our armrests.

170
00:09:53,858 --> 00:09:55,627
These are I got a couple of shelf brackets
here.

171
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,829
We have got a shelf over in the workshop.

172
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:59,164
There had four brackets on it.

173
00:09:59,564 --> 00:10:04,469
No shelf needs four brackets, so I took
these two off and I figure they're not doing

174
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:11,442
anything anyway. Well, I guess I might as
well have taken all four.

175
00:10:12,977 --> 00:10:17,682
I don't worry about it. Spilled paint dries
fast, OK, and I'm going to mount these

176
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:19,651
supports on here using the handyman secret
weapon.

177
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:24,122
Duct tape. All right.

178
00:10:25,023 --> 00:10:29,727
And now the next step, we had this ABS
drainpipe on here.

179
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:33,264
Kind of a mixed media project we got going
on with the plastic toilet in the middle and

180
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:37,402
what have you. And not to mention the tape
and these go on here not only serve as

181
00:10:37,402 --> 00:10:41,039
armrests, but also as guides for the
mechanism that's going to raise and lower the

182
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:46,778
foot pedal. And again, we'll use the
handyman secret weapon to attach these duct

183
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:50,048
tape. I'm not I'm not quite sure how much of
a secret it is anymore.

184
00:10:50,148 --> 00:10:51,849
Oh, wow, wow.

185
00:10:52,517 --> 00:10:56,921
How's it look? I run the sash cord up
through my armrest connected to my seat

186
00:10:57,422 --> 00:10:59,590
lifting leg lifter and then up into the
eyeballs.

187
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:03,394
I've hooked into the back of the chair and I
was just, it's a fantastic thing.

188
00:11:03,394 --> 00:11:08,433
When you lean back up, she comes, as we say,
just look at that now.

189
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:09,801
The easy part upholsterer.

190
00:11:11,969 --> 00:11:16,340
I suppose you could. You could attach this
more permanent with staples.

191
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:20,378
Or maybe you want to duct tape that on there
or maybe put a screw into it or whatever.

192
00:11:20,378 --> 00:11:25,083
But I suggest the paper clips and that way
you can, you know, take her by I take her off

193
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:29,187
every two or three years, give her a shake,
you know, get some of among other I know

194
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:34,258
she's comfortable and just just think of the
money that you've saved money that would have

195
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:35,426
gone to a furniture company.

196
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:44,368
This thing by clear cut money that can money
that can now go to a chiropractor.

197
00:11:45,937 --> 00:11:49,040
So remember, women don't find you handsome.

198
00:11:49,507 --> 00:11:51,108
They should at least find you lying down,

199
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:56,647
Got some cream soda and a lovely microwave
bundt cake?

200
00:11:57,481 --> 00:12:01,853
You know, don't don't cry.

201
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,989
Sure, you come to know

202
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:06,657
Right up the door. Here we go.

203
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:20,137
It is summer, I remember when you could
cruise on the river for free.

204
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:24,041
Last week I went and it cost me $8000.

205
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:26,344
The river was dried up.

206
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:29,113
The eight grand was for boat repairs.

207
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,857
Oh, everybody's pretty concerned about the
lack of marine life in Possum Lake.

208
00:12:40,057 --> 00:12:44,428
I mean, we drink that water, we bathe in
that water, so we would kind of like to know

209
00:12:44,428 --> 00:12:45,496
what's killing the fish.

210
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,665
Well, you did say you bathed in it.

211
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,301
Well, you know, that's a thought.

212
00:12:50,301 --> 00:12:51,435
That's how that is just a fart.

213
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:54,905
You know, one of those cause and effect kind
of thing, Carol.

214
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:58,776
You know, when we bathe in the lake, it adds
a whole bunch of life forms.

215
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:02,480
You know, without the stuff that washes off
us, the algae would probably starve to death.

216
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:05,549
Ok, I never I never considered that.

217
00:13:05,816 --> 00:13:09,620
I mean, who actually knew that the lack of
personal hygiene amongst the lodge members

218
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:13,624
would, you know, would be actually
benefiting the Possum Lake ecosystem?

219
00:13:13,824 --> 00:13:15,059
Yeah, exactly right, Harold.

220
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,863
Anyway, Doc Rinder wants Bob to join him in.

221
00:13:18,863 --> 00:13:23,901
In a survey of the bottom of the lake and
old man Sedgwick has turned his pickup truck

222
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:25,169
into a two man submarine.

223
00:13:26,003 --> 00:13:27,938
How do you turn a pickup into a submarine?

224
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:29,940
Oh, you park it too close to the lake?

225
00:13:31,175 --> 00:13:32,209
It rolled and didn't it?

226
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:33,444
Yeah, I rolled in.

227
00:13:34,311 --> 00:13:36,280
So who's going to drive bob or dock?

228
00:13:36,614 --> 00:13:40,484
Well, they drew straws and the one who got
the longest straw used as an air hose.

229
00:13:41,051 --> 00:13:42,086
Personally, I don't think they're going to
go.

230
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:44,955
Well, we have to go uncle that right over the
next segment.

231
00:13:46,257 --> 00:13:47,258
Dive, Harold Dive.

232
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:57,167
Hey, Glenn. Oh, hi, IRA.

233
00:13:57,868 --> 00:13:59,103
How's the Marina business going?

234
00:14:00,104 --> 00:14:01,138
Oh, you know, going nuts?

235
00:14:01,171 --> 00:14:02,773
It's a busy time of the year.

236
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:07,711
All right, Glenn, I want to talk to you about
the lake.

237
00:14:08,412 --> 00:14:09,413
Take a look at these tire, Fred.

238
00:14:10,714 --> 00:14:11,982
Like a good look? Don't get right in there.

239
00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:12,917
The brand new tires.

240
00:14:14,618 --> 00:14:15,753
Oh, travel, that's OK.

241
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:16,887
Not the

242
00:14:16,887 --> 00:14:18,856
Tread. Read the nubs.

243
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,493
No. The tire. No. It's the little things
that stick out when you going to brand new on

244
00:14:22,493 --> 00:14:24,728
the side there. They're like whiskers or
something.

245
00:14:24,962 --> 00:14:26,297
Yeah, they're falling off.

246
00:14:26,297 --> 00:14:27,231
Like, I can't believe.

247
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,667
Wow, what are you going to do, Glen?

248
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:33,671
They go down to the RV dealership and cut
the nubs off brand new tires and come back

249
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:36,740
here and glue them on under your tires every
time you want to go for a ride.

250
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:40,044
What kind of glue would you use for that,
right?

251
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:42,880
Right, I'm joking.

252
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,049
Then how do you mean?

253
00:14:48,052 --> 00:14:49,820
Do you think there's any fish left in the
lake here?

254
00:14:49,853 --> 00:14:50,354
What bottom

255
00:14:50,354 --> 00:14:52,289
Lake? Yeah, oh, tons of fish out there,
still?

256
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:57,261
Yeah. You know, airplane glue, airplane glue
would do it.

257
00:14:58,328 --> 00:15:01,565
You know, not now. Doc says that there's no
fish left in the lake at all.

258
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:03,467
What is it with duck and fish?

259
00:15:04,001 --> 00:15:07,204
He's got a fish fixation that's not healthy.

260
00:15:08,005 --> 00:15:11,408
They also don't go for a ride, right?

261
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:12,876
I got to get some airplanes with.

262
00:15:14,378 --> 00:15:17,714
No, no, no, no. I got to see about getting
the lake restocked the fish.

263
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:20,884
Well, we'll go to the lake restocking fish
place.

264
00:15:21,718 --> 00:15:22,653
Yeah, where they sell the fish.

265
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:23,754
Where's that?

266
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:25,989
I don't know. But what?

267
00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:27,090
Chris Brown until we find one.

268
00:15:28,425 --> 00:15:30,160
No, that's okay. I got to make a couple of
calls.

269
00:15:30,427 --> 00:15:32,095
First off. I'll see you later, Lynn.

270
00:15:32,162 --> 00:15:33,130
Ok, right? Sure. Yeah.

271
00:15:35,365 --> 00:15:38,202
Whoa. Hey. Tires are made of rubber.

272
00:15:38,635 --> 00:15:41,238
Rubber cement. Wait a go, Glenn.

273
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,945
And speaking of things made of rubber, it's
time for adventures with Bill.

274
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:56,220
Bill had smashed his car into Glen's holding
tank there, and so he was going to use this

275
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,924
to pretend that his car is on fire and stuck
on the side of the road and the various

276
00:16:00,924 --> 00:16:07,431
safety, the various safety things that you
can do when your car are stuck on the side of

277
00:16:07,431 --> 00:16:10,834
the road. So he's going to he wants me to
pretend that I've been in an accident and

278
00:16:11,101 --> 00:16:14,304
injured when you stick your tongue out when
you're injured, apparently I didn't know

279
00:16:14,304 --> 00:16:19,576
that. And then he's going to get some gear
area to bag or something and a fire

280
00:16:19,576 --> 00:16:23,513
extinguisher. He's going to take the van and
pretend that, you know, he's just dragged

281
00:16:23,513 --> 00:16:26,917
along and he sees me lying there injured.

282
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:31,555
First thing Bill has to realize is that
reverse starts.

283
00:16:31,555 --> 00:16:33,757
When are OK?

284
00:16:33,757 --> 00:16:38,695
So I'm lying there wondering, and I look
back and he's coming 30 40 miles an hour, and

285
00:16:38,996 --> 00:16:40,564
then the fire extinguisher falls down.

286
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:41,898
Oh my god, oh my God.

287
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:46,002
Now he can't see. Oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, oh
oh, I'm going to lie down.

288
00:16:48,638 --> 00:16:50,340
Well, that gets rid of the door problem.

289
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,578
Things eventually clear up and.

290
00:16:56,346 --> 00:17:01,351
I don't think this is part of the plan, but
you never know with Bill that's working well.

291
00:17:03,754 --> 00:17:10,727
So Plan B, but we do now as he gets out his
little bag and I don't want to impress.

292
00:17:10,727 --> 00:17:12,429
They're doing anyway. You could said he was
done there.

293
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:18,201
So flares, you've set these flares up all
around your car so that people can see them

294
00:17:18,568 --> 00:17:22,372
go on. You know, that night I had noticed
something about the flares that he had.

295
00:17:22,405 --> 00:17:24,508
They had a word on their belly.

296
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:29,045
I didn't. I didn't like to look at that in a
big way and suddenly occurred to bill that

297
00:17:29,713 --> 00:17:31,081
maybe these weren't flares.

298
00:17:31,515 --> 00:17:33,250
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

299
00:17:33,316 --> 00:17:34,251
Oh boy, oh

300
00:17:34,351 --> 00:17:36,686
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh.

301
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,357
And by golly.

302
00:17:41,925 --> 00:17:47,931
Well, people have noticed you there and
looks like the car has gone to a safer place.

303
00:17:56,606 --> 00:18:00,577
So anyway, Bob and Doc kind of chickened out
on the two man sub idea, but they still

304
00:18:00,577 --> 00:18:04,281
wanted to inspect the bottom of Possum Lake,
so what they did was they popped a skylight

305
00:18:04,281 --> 00:18:07,851
into the roof of the tool shed and then
flipped it over into the lake to uses a glass

306
00:18:07,851 --> 00:18:11,087
bottom boat. Oh man, Sedgwick went with them
for luck.

307
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:15,725
Bad been out there about a half mile and
they had so many slugs and leeches on the

308
00:18:15,725 --> 00:18:17,494
underside of the skylight they couldn't see
through it.

309
00:18:18,128 --> 00:18:21,965
So Bob and Doc got down there, started
tapping on the plexiglass, trying to knock

310
00:18:21,965 --> 00:18:25,068
those things off. Their old man says, we
thought somebody was knocking on the door, so

311
00:18:25,068 --> 00:18:29,873
he opened it. The whole thing sank and they
managed to swim into sharks is really no harm

312
00:18:29,873 --> 00:18:33,543
done other than the fact that old man
Sedgwick's pickup truck now has a tool shed

313
00:18:33,543 --> 00:18:34,144
in the back.

314
00:18:34,978 --> 00:18:38,348
You know, accurate. I heard that Bob and Doc,
they're still arguing about the condition in

315
00:18:38,348 --> 00:18:41,951
the lake and that Bob, he's got conclusive
evidence that he's going to bring to the

316
00:18:41,951 --> 00:18:42,952
lodge meeting tonight.

317
00:18:43,453 --> 00:18:44,721
Well, I hope it's not his wife.

318
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:47,057
Which one? He had about five.

319
00:18:47,891 --> 00:18:49,492
I hope it's not one through four.

320
00:18:51,594 --> 00:18:53,129
There's the call the wild possum.

321
00:18:53,263 --> 00:18:54,964
Come on, uncle. Let's go Lance.

322
00:18:54,964 --> 00:18:56,466
This boil up.

323
00:18:57,801 --> 00:18:59,335
Harold has a touch of a poet, doesn't he?

324
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:01,538
Anyway, I'll just nip down here.

325
00:19:01,538 --> 00:19:05,041
If you don't take a minute and I'll either
relieve somebody's embarrassment or add to it

326
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,309
whatever seems in order.

327
00:19:06,342 --> 00:19:07,477
Or more fun.

328
00:19:07,877 --> 00:19:09,212
That's what being a leader is all about.

329
00:19:10,847 --> 00:19:14,751
We have.

330
00:19:19,956 --> 00:19:20,456
Right.

331
00:19:28,565 --> 00:19:38,408
I know. The floor recognizes Bob Stevenson

332
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:42,478
Like a rebel. Well, I've been running a

333
00:19:42,478 --> 00:19:44,814
Battery of tests on the lake water.

334
00:19:44,814 --> 00:19:51,287
I was down at the ministry lab all afternoon
and I found that well, I was happy to find

335
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:55,491
that all the water in Possum Lake is fresh,
clean and pure.

336
00:19:58,361 --> 00:19:59,796
What the heck could have caused that pop?

337
00:20:01,264 --> 00:20:06,569
Well, nothing read just the test when I was
doing shows at the lake is brimming with

338
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:12,775
marine life. And if people can't catch fish,
it's because people can't catch fish.

339
00:20:14,243 --> 00:20:19,248
Oh, I took the liberty of hiring a private
laboratory to run some checks on the lake

340
00:20:19,248 --> 00:20:22,085
myself, somebody that knows what they're
doing.

341
00:20:23,286 --> 00:20:24,420
I know I'm a golfer.

342
00:20:26,622 --> 00:20:29,292
Possum Lake is totally sterile.

343
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,561
Nothing can go in that water.

344
00:20:31,561 --> 00:20:34,230
Not fish, not worms, not algae.

345
00:20:35,765 --> 00:20:42,338
And once more, there are highly toxic levels
of arsenic, palladium and mercury.

346
00:20:42,405 --> 00:20:43,973
So, yeah, let me see this.

347
00:20:44,474 --> 00:20:46,209
Hey, that's the same stuff I put in my tire.

348
00:20:46,642 --> 00:20:49,278
Watch what a tire wash.

349
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:53,716
Yeah, I used to get all the germs and stuff
off my tires.

350
00:20:53,716 --> 00:20:56,319
Yeah, yeah. Right away, it's sterilize the
rubber.

351
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,554
Yeah, stuff. I invented myself.

352
00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:02,058
If you would, some of the stuff on the road
gets stuck on your tire.

353
00:21:02,058 --> 00:21:05,294
You know you're saying wash washing tires
with this stuff, Glenn?

354
00:21:05,328 --> 00:21:07,964
Yeah. And then you just rinse it right into
the lake.

355
00:21:08,431 --> 00:21:11,033
Where else would you read this thing?

356
00:21:11,934 --> 00:21:14,904
So Possum Lake died so you could have clean
white walls?

357
00:21:14,937 --> 00:21:16,806
Is that it? Oh, wait me,

358
00:21:17,907 --> 00:21:22,712
Bob, how long do you think it'd take possibly
to to regenerate all the fish life and

359
00:21:22,712 --> 00:21:23,379
everything again?

360
00:21:24,313 --> 00:21:33,289
Well, see arsenic, palladium, palladium, the
worst kind mercury.

361
00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:34,590
Well, they're all fairly heavy.

362
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:38,661
And also, if the fish are soaked up all that
stuff and then die, they've probably gone to

363
00:21:38,661 --> 00:21:41,897
the bottom of the league, so it should
recover fairly quickly.

364
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:46,502
I'd say that the lake will probably be
brimming again with marine life and about

365
00:21:47,837 --> 00:21:48,938
three thousand years old.

366
00:21:49,805 --> 00:21:50,239
Right wing

367
00:21:50,273 --> 00:21:52,241
3000. That's a lot.

368
00:21:52,341 --> 00:21:53,309
Three thousand years.

369
00:21:53,476 --> 00:21:54,510
Well, that's not very long.

370
00:21:55,278 --> 00:21:56,579
Well, it might not be long for Bob.

371
00:21:56,612 --> 00:21:57,647
He works for the government.

372
00:21:59,348 --> 00:22:04,920
Relax, the guy that I spoke to said that by
seeding the lake with the fingerlings and

373
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,225
plants and the various bacteria, well, we
can see the fish coming back in a couple of

374
00:22:09,225 --> 00:22:11,994
months. Oh, really?

375
00:22:12,361 --> 00:22:13,629
Yeah. Does that work?

376
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,132
Where do I fish in the meantime?

377
00:22:16,665 --> 00:22:18,434
Well, I could take you to where the fish are.

378
00:22:18,434 --> 00:22:22,004
Doc MRV Oh yeah, like maybe over to Lake
Morris.

379
00:22:23,005 --> 00:22:30,012
Well, how about the Yukon for some salmon
the Yukon that you the tires?

380
00:22:30,012 --> 00:22:31,080
Do we get back? Oh, OK.

381
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:34,917
Oh, just kidding, right? All right.

382
00:22:35,084 --> 00:22:40,122
Well, if there's no other large business,
OK, then I'm going to call on Glenn here to

383
00:22:40,122 --> 00:22:41,257
give us the evening's entertainment.

384
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,796
Am planning on it. Could you get those on the
way up there?

385
00:22:47,963 --> 00:22:49,398
Thank you. Palladium.

386
00:22:50,466 --> 00:22:52,334
These are slides. Are they glad, sir?

387
00:22:52,735 --> 00:22:56,972
Well, I'm sure Possum Lake will restock
itself gradually will encourage people to

388
00:22:56,972 --> 00:22:59,308
flush minnows down the toilet, so that
should get things started.

389
00:22:59,742 --> 00:23:03,179
That's the least we can do, which is more or
less our specialty anyway.

390
00:23:03,746 --> 00:23:06,949
My wife is watching. I'll be coming straight
home after the meeting, so you might want to

391
00:23:06,949 --> 00:23:08,551
set the electric blanket on defrost.

392
00:23:10,085 --> 00:23:14,190
Until next time on behalf of myself and
Harold and the whole gang up here at Possum

393
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,925
Lodge. Keep your stick on the ice.

394
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:21,397
That's the name for himself right now.

395
00:23:23,232 --> 00:23:25,734
I'm just going to grab a seat, put it in the
bucket.

396
00:23:27,436 --> 00:23:29,572
Oh, this is the ninety five stuff right
here, right?

397
00:23:29,705 --> 00:23:30,472
Yeah, we are going

398
00:23:30,506 --> 00:23:32,908
In New England. Yeah. I cut off the other
side there.

399
00:23:33,142 --> 00:23:34,877
One over here. Here, I cut her off.

400
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,512
Now what's way out?

401
00:23:36,512 --> 00:23:38,914
I have just one hand. I got the guy out
there.

402
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:39,915
All right.

403
00:23:40,516 --> 00:23:42,985
Sixty five, you want to do this?

404
00:23:43,018 --> 00:23:44,053
A different speed of down.

405
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,723
I'll be. If we're breaking the law, you can
really figure one.
