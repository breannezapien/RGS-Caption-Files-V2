WALKS AND SHE SITS

THERE'S NOWHERE
TO PUT 'EM

AND SPIT THEM AT THE WAITER

TOLD HER YET.

WHY IS IT THAT MEN
LEAVE EVERYTHING TO
THE LAST MINUTE?

77
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,346

TO COVER OUR BACKSIDES

IT'S JUST 'CAUSE,

00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:47,993
WELL, WE'RE REALLY JUST
KIND OF ASHAMED OF

ANYWAY, WE'RE GOING
TO GIVE YOU AN EXCUSE

SO YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GO
TO A TRIP, ALL RIGHT?

COMES DOWN AND HE'S UP
ON HIS FEET ON SUNDAY

00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,956
LOOKING FOR
SOMETHING TO DO.

95
00:04:18,924 --> 00:04:21,927
SHE'S GOING TO SEE THROUGH
THAT LIKE A SCREEN DOOR.

96
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:23,596
SHE'LL KNOW
YOU'RE LYING.

97
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,831
WELL, AND THAT'S THE
TRICK TO BAD LYING.

98
00:04:25,831 --> 00:04:28,100

YOUR LOVED ONE THINK

99
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,170
SHE FIGURED IT ALL
OUT FOR HERSELF.

100
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,839
THAT WAY SHE'LL GET MAD
AND GET IT ALL BLOWN OFF

THEN, OF COURSE, YOU CAN
GO OFF WITH THE GUYS

TRYING TO CATCH
THEMSELVES A CATFISH,

114
00:05:25,724 --> 00:05:28,794

YOU ONE OF THE SECRETS OF
FRESHWATER FISHING.

115
00:05:28,794 --> 00:05:30,896
JUST ONE WORD: IMAGE.

116
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:33,365
YOU GOT TO LOOK
LIKE YOU'RE THE EXPERT.

117
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:35,234
IT DOESN'T CATCH
ANY MORE FISH,

118
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,136
BUT IT SURE INTIMIDATES
THE OTHER FISHERMEN

119
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,405
AND FISHERWOMEN AND
FISHERKIDS AND SO ON.

120
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,939
AND IT MAKES THEM
LOSE THEIR CONCENTRATION,

121
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:42,341
THEY START DOING STUPID
THINGS, YOU KNOW,

122
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,842
STICKING THEIR HOOKS
IN THEIR THUMBS

123
00:05:43,842 --> 00:05:45,744
OR TRYING TO SCALE FISH
WITH THE OUTBOARD MOTOR.

124
00:05:45,744 --> 00:05:47,880
OR EVEN WORSE,
THEY TRY TO COPY YOU,

125
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,215
AND THAT PRETTY MUCH
GUARANTEES FAILURE.

126
00:05:50,215 --> 00:05:52,518
NOW, I GOT A COUPLE OF FISHING
BOATS ON A TRAILER HERE.

127
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,554
I DID HAVE THEM ON
A TRAILER.

128
00:05:55,554 --> 00:05:56,855
WELL, IT LOOKED
LIKE A 1-7/8

129
00:05:56,855 --> 00:05:58,724
BUT I GUESS THAT WAS
A 2-INCH HITCH.

130
00:05:58,724 --> 00:06:01,126
THERE'S ONLY TWO WAYS
REALLY TO CREATE AN IMAGE.

131
00:06:01,126 --> 00:06:02,694
ONE IS TO LIE,

132
00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:05,631
WHICH HAS BEEN PRETTY MUCH
OVERUSED SINCE THE NIXON ERA,

133
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:09,268
AND THE OTHER ONE IS TO HAVE
REAL IMPRESSIVE LOOKING
FISHING EQUIPMENT,

134
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:10,803
BUT THAT TAKES
A LOT OF MONEY.

135
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:13,539
SO TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW
YOU HOW YOU CAN USE A
REAL CHEAP METHOD

136
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,508
TO LOOK LIKE A
RICH SUCCESSFUL FISHERMAN.

137
00:06:16,508 --> 00:06:18,377
YOU'VE ALL SEEN A
STRETCH LIMO.

138
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:21,213
YOU HEARD OF ONE OF THEM DC
STRETCH EIGHT AIRPLANES.

139
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:23,582
HOW ABOUT A STRETCH
FISHING BOAT?

140
00:06:23,582 --> 00:06:25,551
ALL'S YOU NEED IS A CHAIN SAW,

141
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:29,788
AND YOU CAN TURN A PAIR OF
PUNTS INTO A TWO-HULLER.

142
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:39,298
THERE WE GO.

143
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:42,467
NOW WE GOT ALL OUR PIECES TO
MAKE OURSELVES A REALLY
BIG FISHING BOAT.

144
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:43,936
HERE IS AN EXTRA BONUS...

145
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:47,339
WE MANAGED TO MAKE
OURSELVES AN ANCHOR.

146
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:48,707
THAT WAS LUCKY.

147
00:06:48,707 --> 00:06:51,109
NOW WHAT WE GOT TO DO IS
SEPARATE OUR BOW OUT
FROM OUR STERN

148
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:52,411
TO START STRETCHING HER OUT.

149
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,746
SO LET'S GET THE BOW
OUT OF THE WAY.

150
00:06:54,746 --> 00:06:56,548
ALRIGHTY.

151
00:06:56,548 --> 00:07:00,085
TRY TO LINE-UP
THE CUTS THERE.

152
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:04,022
NOW WE GOT THE STERN
OUT THROUGH THERE.

153
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:08,994
[ GRUNTING ]

154
00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:10,429
ALL RIGHT.

155
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:12,431
NOW ALL WE GOT TO DO
IS COME IN HERE AND
TAKE OUR MID SHIP

156
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:15,100
AND MOVE IT BACK INTO
OUR MID SHIP.

157
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,403
[ GROANING ]

158
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:21,006
THERE WE GO.

159
00:07:21,006 --> 00:07:22,874
NOW, OF COURSE, CONNECT
ALL THE PIECES TOGETHER

160
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:26,211
USING, SAY,
RIVETS OR WELDING
OR, YOU GUESSED IT,

161
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:29,147
THE HANDYMAN SECRET WEAPON,
DUCT TAPE.

162
00:07:29,147 --> 00:07:30,749
NOW, THE PADDLES
HERE HAVE GOT TO GO

163
00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:35,353
BECAUSE YOU CANNOT BE POWERING
A CRAFT OF THIS NATURE AND
TRY TO LOOK AFFLUENT

164
00:07:35,353 --> 00:07:38,056
IF YOU'RE DRIVING
ALONG WITH PADDLES.

165
00:07:38,056 --> 00:07:41,126
SO I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU
GO WITH AN OUTBOARD MOTOR
ON THERE OF SOME NATURE.

166
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:43,128
MAYBE 100 HORSEPOWER,
MAYBE EVEN MORE,

167
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:45,697
DEPENDING ON HOW
BAD YOUR SEAMS LEAK.

168
00:07:45,697 --> 00:07:48,834
OH, WELL...

169
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:51,736
ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE A COUPLE
OF PIECES LEFT OVER HERE.

170
00:07:51,736 --> 00:07:54,106
WE HAVE A BOW,
WE HAVE A STERN.

171
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,875
YOU KNOW HOW I
HATE LEFTOVERS.

172
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,343
I GOT AN IDEA.

173
00:08:00,212 --> 00:08:01,580
THERE WE GO.

174
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,482
WHAT'S BETTER THAN A
STRETCH FISHING BOAT?

175
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:07,052
HOW ABOUT A STRETCH FISHING
BOAT WITH A BEMINI TOP, HUH?

176
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:09,688
KEEPS THE SUN OFF YOU
AND YOUR COOLER,

177
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:11,289
KEEPS THE RAIN OFF.

178
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:12,591
TALK ABOUT IMAGE,

179
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:15,327
YOU LOOK LIKE CLEOPATRA
BARGING YOUR WAY
DOWN THE NILE.

180
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:18,430
SO UNTIL NEXT TIME,
HAPPY FISHING.

181
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,699
AND REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

182
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:23,101
THEY SHOULD AT
LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

183
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:28,006
OH HERE'S
ANOTHER BONUS...

184
00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:30,242
SHE DOUBLES AS A LIFEBOAT.

185
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:33,245
THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST
IMPORTANT FEATURE OF ALL.

186
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:35,380
Red: COMING UP, WE'RE GOING
TO CLEAN OUT BUZZ'S PLANE,

187
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,916
AND I'M GOING TO SPLIT SOME
WOOD WHILE I TALK TO
THE TEENAGERS

188
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,485
SO IT WON'T BE A
COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME.

189
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:46,358
I WAS IN TOWN THE OTHER DAY

190
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:48,293
AND SAW A BUNCH OF KIDS
ON THOSE ROLLER BLADES.

191
00:08:48,293 --> 00:08:49,761
YOU KNOW WHAT
ROLLER BLADES ARE?

192
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:52,130
THEY'RE THOSE LITTLE SKATES
THAT HAVE COUCH CASTERS

193
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,932
ON THEM INSTEAD OF BLADES.

194
00:08:53,932 --> 00:08:55,967
NOW, LOOK, I DON'T LIKE TO
MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT
YOU TEENAGERS

195
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:57,369
AND YOUR FREE TIME
AND HOW YOU WASTE IT,

196
00:08:57,369 --> 00:08:59,471
BUT ARE YOU GUYS
CRAZY OR WHAT?

197
00:08:59,471 --> 00:09:01,606
SKATES ARE FOR ICE,
NOT FOR PAVEMENT.

198
00:09:01,606 --> 00:09:02,974
WHEN YOU FALL ON ICE SKATES,

199
00:09:02,974 --> 00:09:04,576
OKAY, YOU'RE GOING
TO SLIDE FOR A WHILE,

200
00:09:04,576 --> 00:09:06,978
YOU MIGHT SCON YOUR NOGGIN ON
THE GOAL POST OR SOMETHING,

201
00:09:06,978 --> 00:09:08,146
BUT YOU'LL GET OVER IT,

202
00:09:08,146 --> 00:09:09,648
YOU KNOW, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO
CARRY ON A CONVERSATION,

203
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:11,950
PERHAPS HAVE CHILDREN
OF YOUR OWN SOME DAY.

204
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,986
WHEREAS YOU FALL ON THE
ROLLERS BLADES ON THE
PAVEMENT THERE

205
00:09:14,986 --> 00:09:17,422
AND YOU'RE GOING TO LEAVE A
TRAIL OF SKIN AND FLESH

206
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:20,825
THAT WILL MAKE IT REALLY HARD
TO IDENTIFY THE BODY AT THE
END OF THE SKID MARK.

207
00:09:22,927 --> 00:09:25,730
WITH A GRITTY SURFACE LIKE,
SAY, CEMENT OR PAVEMENT,

208
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,967
THE COEFFICIENT OF FRICTION
IS REALLY WORKING AGAINST
YOU THERE.

00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:30,969

TAKE IT EASY.

YEAH, 47 FOOT CATFISH.

224
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:13,912
THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE A RECORD
I WOULD THINK OF SOME KIND.

225
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:15,213
THAT'S NOT A RECORD,

226
00:10:15,213 --> 00:10:19,317
THAT'S SOME KIND OF
MUTANT FREAK OF NATURE.

227
00:10:19,317 --> 00:10:22,053
WELL, YOU WOULD
KNOW, HAROLD.

228

FIRST TIME A TOW TRUCK
HAD BEEN USED TO
BRING IN A FISH

231
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:29,527
AS FAR
AS I WOULD KNOW.

232

WOW! WHO MANAGED TO REEL IN
AND LAND A FISH THAT SIZE?

AS BAIT.

I'M GUESSING THERE'S
A STORY HERE.

IT'S A NORMAL FISH
STORY, HAROLD.

OLD MAN SEDGWICK
THROWS THE ANCHOR OVER,

241
00:10:50,848 --> 00:10:53,951
THE ANCHOR CHAIN TANGLES
AROUND STINKY'S FOOT,
OVER HE GOES,

242
00:10:53,951 --> 00:10:58,523
FISH SWALLOWS STINKY,
DIES, FLOATS TO SURFACE,

243
00:10:58,523 --> 00:10:59,991
THEY TOW THE FISH IN,

OUT COMES STINKY.

245

HAVE SEEN THE ONE
THAT GOT AWAY.

256
00:11:30,455 --> 00:11:31,989
ACTUALLY, RED,
THIS IS A KIT PLANE.

257
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:34,459
I BUILT IT AROUND AN
OLD VOLKSWAGON BEETLE
I USED TO HAVE.

258
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:35,827
ACTUALLY,
I HAD NINE OF THEM.

ALL RIGHT.

THROW IT OUT.
THROW IT OUT.
ALL RIGHT.

YEAH, AFTER TODAY I'M
GOING TO SELL BEAUTY,

264
00:11:46,904 --> 00:11:48,773
AND I'M GOING TO
BUY A SUBMARINE.

265

WHAT, WHERE ARE YOU GOING
TO FIND A SUBMARINE?

266
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,477
DOWN ON POSSUM LAKE.

267

HAS BEACHED THEIR SUBMARINE
OVER ON ROCK REEF POINT.

273
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:10,728
I EVEN TOOK A
PICTURE OF IT, SEE.

274
00:12:10,728 --> 00:12:11,996
THAT'S NOT A SUBMARINE.

275
00:12:11,996 --> 00:12:14,131
THAT'S THE BIG CATFISH
OLD MAN SEDGWICK CAUGHT.

276
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:16,634
WOW! NO KIDDING!
YEAH.

277
00:12:16,634 --> 00:12:18,369
WELL, KEEP THE GEIGER
COUNTER IN THERE.

278
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:22,106
WE GOT TO CHECK
THIS MUTANT OUT.
ALRIGHTY.

279
00:12:24,075 --> 00:12:26,911
WOW! THAT WAS
THE GREATEST.

280
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:28,913
MAN, HAROLD, YOU MISSED
SOME GREAT STUNTS.

281
00:12:28,913 --> 00:12:31,248
I MEAN, TECHNICALLY
THESE PLANES AREN'T CAPABLE

282
00:12:31,248 --> 00:12:32,717
OF DOING THOSE
KIND OF MANEUVERS,

283
00:12:32,717 --> 00:12:34,552
BUT THE PEOPLE THAT WRITE
THE TECHNICAL MANUALS,

284
00:12:34,552 --> 00:12:36,487
THEY'RE A BUNCH
OF WIMPS!

WELL, THANKS, BUZZ.

287
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:47,365
YEAH, IT WAS

00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:18,262
"WHERE IT'S
MINUS 10 DEGREES,

299
00:13:18,262 --> 00:13:22,233
"WIND CHILL FACTOR,
MINUS 30."

300
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:24,068
IT'S MAIL CALL.

301
00:13:26,637 --> 00:13:28,639
I GOT A LETTER HERE
FROM VINCENT COOMBE.

302
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,674
VINCENT HAS DRAWN
A PICTURE OF YOU
AND I, HAROLD.

303
00:13:30,674 --> 00:13:32,710
BOY, HE SURE GOT
YOU RIGHT, DIDN'T HE?

304
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,946
HE MADE YOU A
LITTLE THIN THOUGH.

305
00:13:35,946 --> 00:13:39,884
I GOT A LETTER HERE
FROM MATTHEW BABY
FROM EDMONTON.

306
00:13:39,884 --> 00:13:42,153
MATTHEW IS ONE OF
OUR YOUNGER VIEWERS.

307
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:43,554
AND MATTHEW WRITES:

308
00:13:43,554 --> 00:13:46,090
"SOMETIMES MY SIBLINGS SAY
THAT THE RED GREEN SHOW
IS FOR IDIOTS."

309
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,791
OH, NO, NO,
I DON'T THINK SO.

310
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,994
DOES YOUR FAMILY WATCH
THE SHOW, HAROLD?

311
00:13:49,994 --> 00:13:51,195
NO.

312
00:13:51,195 --> 00:13:53,397
SEE!

313
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,770
ALRIGHTY, HERE'S A
LETTER HERE FROM --
HEY, WAIT A SECOND.

314
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:03,707
HERE'S A LETTER
HERE FROM KAREN

315
00:14:03,707 --> 00:14:05,609
AND SHE SAYS: "YOUR SHOW IS
JUST LIKE WHAT IS HAPPENING

316
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:08,145
"HERE IN AU TRAIN WITH
US AND OUR NEIGHBOURS."

317
00:14:08,145 --> 00:14:10,981
WELL, KAREN, I WOULD
SUGGEST YOU MOVE,

318
00:14:10,981 --> 00:14:14,218
SAY, BEIRUT OR
SOMEWHERE SAFE.

319
00:14:14,218 --> 00:14:15,719
GOOD ADVICE.

320
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:17,621
OH, UNCLE RED, LISTEN TO THIS,
LISTEN TO THIS, LISTEN TO THIS,

321
00:14:17,621 --> 00:14:18,989
SOUNDS JUST LIKE
THE POSSUM VAN.

322
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:21,859
"P.S. ONE PERSON UP HERE
ACTUALLY BURIED AN OLD VAN

323
00:14:21,859 --> 00:14:24,795
"AND USED IT
FOR A SEPTIC TANK."

324
00:14:24,795 --> 00:14:27,665
WELL, I'M NOT PLANNING ON
DOING THAT WITH THE
POSSUM VAN, HAROLD

325
00:14:27,665 --> 00:14:29,033
OH, I KNOW, NOT YOU,

326
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:32,102
BUT I THOUGHT MAYBE THE
GUY WHO SOLD IT TO
YOU DID THAT.

327
00:14:34,638 --> 00:14:36,540
WELL, SOMETHING A LITTLE
BIT SPECIAL THIS WEEK.

328
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,275
BILL IS HAVING HIS
VERY OWN  VERSION

329
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:40,210
OF THE POSSUM LODGE
OLYMPIC GAMES.

330
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,880
HE'S GOT THE TORCH THERE.
WHOA. WHOA. WHOA. WHOA.

331
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,448
YEAH, WATCH YOURSELF
THERE, BILL.

332
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:47,084
A LITTLE HAIRCUT COMIN'.
YOU GOT TO LOVE THAT.

333
00:14:47,084 --> 00:14:48,819
ANYWAY, HE HAD THE VARIOUS
EVENTS, LIKE --

334
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:51,889
THAT'S A HAMMER THROW.

335
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:54,358
IS IT THE PENTATHALON?
WHAT THE HECK IS THAT?

336
00:14:54,358 --> 00:14:55,993
ANYWAY, YOU SWING THAT
AROUND AND THE IDEA IS,

337
00:14:55,993 --> 00:14:58,462
I GUESS, IT'S THE
CENTRIFUGAL FORCE,
THEY CALL THIS,

338
00:14:58,462 --> 00:15:02,399
AND YOU LET THAT GO AND THEN
WHATEVER GOES THE FARTHEST,
YOU MEASURE THE DISTANCE.

339
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,401
NO, NO, THE OTHER WAY,
BILL, THE OTHER WAY.

340
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:07,638
BACK OVER TOWARDS --

341
00:15:07,638 --> 00:15:10,074
YEAH, TOWARDS THE VAN.

342
00:15:10,074 --> 00:15:12,009
OH. OH.

343
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:15,012
ALL RIGHT, NOW, THIS
IS ANOTHER EVENT THAT THE
GREEKS MADE VERY FAMOUS,

344
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:17,314
AS THEY DID WITH SO
MANY OF THEIR HABITS.

345
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:19,883
THIS WAS THE DISCUS.

346
00:15:19,883 --> 00:15:23,921
IT'S IN YOUR OTHER
HAND THERE, BILL.

347
00:15:23,921 --> 00:15:25,556
BILL IS NOT GREEK.

348
00:15:25,556 --> 00:15:28,358
THAT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS BY,
ESPECIALLY THAT POSE THERE.

349
00:15:28,358 --> 00:15:30,727
HE SPINS AROUND AND --

350
00:15:30,727 --> 00:15:33,630
OKAY, BILL, STAY
INSIDE THE CIRCLE.

351
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,599
UP SHE COMES
AND IS COMING --

352
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:37,634
BILL, BILL, BILL, BILL,
BILL, BILL, BILL!

353
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:39,837
OH.

354
00:15:39,837 --> 00:15:41,805
STRIKE TWO.

355
00:15:41,805 --> 00:15:43,507
AND WHAT'S THIS?

356
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:45,642
OH, THE SHOT PUT,
THE SHOT PUT.

357
00:15:45,642 --> 00:15:47,911
VERY HEAVY -- OH. OH.

358
00:15:47,911 --> 00:15:49,980
THESE ARE VERY
HEAVY LITTLE BALLS

359
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,482
AND YOU TRY AND THROW
THEM AS FAR AS YOU CAN.

360
00:15:52,482 --> 00:15:55,485
THE OLYMPICS SEEM TO BE
KIND OF A THEME HERE,

361
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:57,554
YOU JUST PICK UP STUFF AND
THROW IT AS FAR AS YOU CAN.

362
00:15:57,554 --> 00:16:01,959
THOSE GREEKS MUST HAVE HAD
TROUBLE WITH THEIR NEIGH --

363
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:04,061
YOU KNOW, I'M THINKING OF
PICKING UP SOMETHING

364
00:16:04,061 --> 00:16:05,762
AND THROWING IT AS
FAR AS I CAN TOO

365
00:16:05,762 --> 00:16:07,030
AND IT'S STANDING
BESIDE ME.

366
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,432
NO YOU DON'T.
NO YOU DON'T.

367
00:16:08,432 --> 00:16:10,500
NO. NO. NO.
NO MEANS NO.

368
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,569
NO.

369
00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:14,338
OH.

370
00:16:14,338 --> 00:16:17,574
TRY THE UNDERHANDED LIKE
TAKING YOUR KID BOWLING
OR SOMETHING.

371
00:16:17,574 --> 00:16:20,210
OH BOY.

372
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:23,747
THANK YOU, BILL.

373
00:16:23,747 --> 00:16:26,116
AND WHAT'S THIS NOW?
OH THE JAVELIN.

374
00:16:26,116 --> 00:16:29,119
NOW I LOVE THIS.
I LOVE THIS -- OH!

375
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:32,522
I LOVE THE IDEA OF BEING
ABLE TO GO OUT AND HUNT

376
00:16:32,522 --> 00:16:36,259
WITH AN ACTUAL SPORTING
EQUIP -- OH!

377
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:38,595
HE'S CAUGHT HIMSELF
UP IN THERE.

378
00:16:38,595 --> 00:16:40,564
YEAH.

379
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:42,733
YOU ALL RIGHT THERE, BILL?

380
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:44,468
I'M TRYING
NOT TO LAUGH.

381
00:16:44,468 --> 00:16:47,671
OH, LET ME HELP YOU.
I'LL STAND ON YOUR FOOT.

382
00:16:47,671 --> 00:16:53,643
THERE YOU GO.
PULL THAT OUT OF THERE.

383
00:16:53,643 --> 00:16:57,781
THERE YOU GO.
NOW YOU CAN CARRY THE -- OH.

384
00:16:57,781 --> 00:17:00,851
SO BILL'S DECIDED THAT
HE CAME IN NUMBER ONE,

385
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:03,386
THE JUDGES RULE OTHERWISE,

386
00:17:03,386 --> 00:17:05,388
SO BILL IS NUMBER TWO.

387
00:17:05,388 --> 00:17:07,290
AND SPEAKING
OF NUMBER TWO...

388
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,459
STAY TUNED, WINSTON ROTHSCHILD
WILL BE HERE

389
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:11,061
TO PUMP YOU OUT,

390
00:17:11,061 --> 00:17:14,164
AND YOU WANT TO BE CLOSE BY
WHEN THE CATFISH EXPLODES.

391
00:17:18,135 --> 00:17:20,537
"THE MATING SEASON," BY ME.

392
00:17:20,537 --> 00:17:23,206
"SPRING, THE MATING SEASON,
THE COURTING RITUAL,

393
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:25,408
"THE PRIMPING AND
PREENING BY THE MALE,

394
00:17:25,408 --> 00:17:28,712
"THE TEASING AND EVENTUAL
CONSENTING BY THE FEMALE,

395
00:17:28,712 --> 00:17:31,147
"THE DECISION AS TO WHO
PAYS FOR THE ROOM."

396
00:17:32,482 --> 00:17:36,586
NEXT, "WOULD THE OWNER OF AN
'85  LESABRE WITH A BLUE DOOR,

397

GREY PRIMER FENDER,

398

NEW CAR, FOR PETE SAKE?"

400
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,965
OH, OKAY!

401
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:55,138
WELL, THAT HUGE CATFISH
OLD MAN SEDGWICK REELED
UP ONTO THE BEACH

402
00:17:55,138 --> 00:17:56,773
HAS TURNED INTO
A REAL ATTRACTION HERE.

403
00:17:56,773 --> 00:17:58,675
I CANNOT BELIEVE PEOPLE
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
BETTER TO DO

404
00:17:58,675 --> 00:18:00,911
THAN STAND AROUND
LOOKING AT DEAD FISH.

405
00:18:00,911 --> 00:18:03,980
JUST LIKE OLD
MAN SEDGWICK LOOKING
IN THE MIRROR, HAROLD.

406
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,649
YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S
GOING TO DO WITH IT?

407
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:07,817
FEED AFRICA FOR A YEAR?

408
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:09,586
NO, HAROLD, HE WANTS
TO MAKE MONEY WITH
THE THING.

409
00:18:09,586 --> 00:18:12,589
UNCLE RED, YOU CANNOT MAKE
MONEY OFF A DEAD CATFISH.

410
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:14,324
NOW, HAROLD, THAT'S
EXACTLY THE REASON

411
00:18:14,324 --> 00:18:16,626
YOUR GENERATION
CAN'T FIND JOBS.

412
00:18:16,626 --> 00:18:18,895
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS
WE WERE THINKING MAYBE

413
00:18:18,895 --> 00:18:21,431
OF COVERING IT WITH
SHEET METAL, MAKE IT
A TOURIST ATTRACTION...

414
00:18:21,431 --> 00:18:24,267
CARL THE CHROME CATFISH.

415
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:26,536
THAT WAS BEFORE WE GOT
THE FISH OIL IDEA.

416
00:18:26,536 --> 00:18:28,471
EXCUSE ME, FISH OIL?

417
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:29,572
YEAH, FISH OIL.

418
00:18:29,572 --> 00:18:31,341
LIKE THEY HAVE
COD LIVER OIL,

419
00:18:31,341 --> 00:18:34,277
WHY NOT SEDGWICK'S
CATFISH GALL BLADDER OIL.

420
00:18:34,277 --> 00:18:35,578
IT'LL BE A MEDICINE.

421
00:18:35,578 --> 00:18:37,213
WHO'S GOING
TO PRESCRIBE IT,

422
00:18:37,213 --> 00:18:39,916
DR. KEVORKIAN?

423
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,518
NO, HAROLD, WE'RE GOING
TO GET RICH HERE.

424
00:18:41,518 --> 00:18:43,553
YOU KNOW WHALE OIL THEY USE
THAT FOR COSMETICS AND PERFUME,

425
00:18:43,553 --> 00:18:46,523
WHY CAN'T THERE BE
CATFISH COSMETICS?

426
00:18:46,523 --> 00:18:50,493
YEAH, YOU CAN CALL IT
FISH FACE.

427
00:18:50,493 --> 00:18:52,328
LAUGH IF YOU
WANT, HAROLD,

428
00:18:52,328 --> 00:18:55,965
YOU WON'T BE LAUGHING WHEN
YOU SEE OUR COLOGNES
IN EVERY STORE.

429
00:18:58,067 --> 00:18:59,369
CATFISH PERFUME,

430
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:02,539
IT'LL REEL IN
THE SUCKERS.

431
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:04,874
I'LL TELL YOU, HAROLD,
THAT FISH IS A WINDFALL.

432
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:09,379
YEAH, BUT ONLY
IF YOU'RE UPWIND.

433
00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:12,182
SINCE WE'RE COMING OUT
WITH OUR NEW LINE OF
CATFISH COLOGNES

434
00:19:12,182 --> 00:19:13,616
AND FISH FRAGRANCES,

435
00:19:13,616 --> 00:19:16,753
I THOUGHT I'D TALK
TO LOCAL ENTREPRENEUR
WINSTON ROTHSCHILD.

436
00:19:16,753 --> 00:19:18,354
IF YOUR SEPTIC
OVERFLOWS

437
00:19:18,354 --> 00:19:21,724
JUST CALL WINSTON
WITH HIS HOSE.

438
00:19:21,724 --> 00:19:24,360
YEAH, WINSTON, YOU'VE
MADE A REAL SUCCESSFUL
BUSINESS HERE, HAVE YOU NOT?

439
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,496
RED, I LIKE TO
THINK I'VE GONE

440
00:19:26,496 --> 00:19:29,199
FROM EFFLUENCE
TO AFFLUENCE.

441
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:33,369
SO, WINSTON, WE'RE
STARTING A NEW THING HERE.

442
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:34,771
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE
MOST IMPORTANT THING

443
00:19:34,771 --> 00:19:36,239
WHEN YOU GO
INTO BUSINESS?

444
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:37,740
IS IT THE RELIABILITY
OF THE SERVICE,

445
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,142
THE DEPENDABILITY,
THE HONESTY,

446
00:19:39,142 --> 00:19:40,677
WHAT IS THE
REAL SECRET?

447
00:19:40,677 --> 00:19:42,712
