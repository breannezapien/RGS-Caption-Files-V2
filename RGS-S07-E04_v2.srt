1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,109
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW!"

2
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:14,647
AND NOW HERE'S THE MAN WHO'S
FORGOTTEN MORE ABOUT
RATIONAL BEHAVIOUR
THAN HE EVER KNEW,

3
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:16,716
YOUR HERO,
YOUR HOST,
MY UNCLE...

00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,351
RED GR-E-E-E-N!

5
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:24,290
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,661
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

7
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:30,563
THANK YOU. APPRECIATE IT.

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,999
BIG, BIG WEEK UP AT THE
LODGE THIS WEEK.

9
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:37,804
WE HAD OUR REMOTE CONTROL
LAWN MOWER RACES.

10
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,873
TALK ABOUT FUN,
ESPECIALLY FOR THE WINNER,

11
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:43,543
OR, AS WE CALL HIM...
THE GUY WHO STILL HAS HIS TOES.

12
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:47,413
YOU KNOW, UNCLE RED,
I COULD'VE TOLD YOU
THAT WASN'T GONNA WORK.

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,116
I COULD'VE TOLD HIM
THAT WASN'T GONNA WORK.
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?

14
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:53,253
'CAUSE MOST REMOTE CONTROL
FREQUENCIES, THEY'RE
ALL THE SAME, RIGHT?
I KNOW.

15
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:56,222
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT MAKES
YOUR LAWN MOWERS GO ALL CRAZY
AND WACKY LIKE THEY DID.

16
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:56,789
YEP.
YEAH.

17
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:57,357
YEAH.
YEP.

18
00:00:57,423 --> 00:00:58,491
YEP.
YEAH.

19
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,227
WAS THERE MUCH PERSONAL
SERIOUS INJURY?

20
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:03,029
WELL, YES AND NO, HAROLD.

21
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,898
BUSTER HADFIELD ESCAPED
WITH JUST A TRIM,

22
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:09,202
BUT JUNIOR SINGLETON WAS
PRETTY WELL MOWED AND MULCHED.

23
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,971
SHOULDN'T YOU BE DOWN AT
THE HOSPITAL EXTENDING
YOUR BEST WISHES?

24
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:15,675
NO, THAT WOULD BE AN
ADMISSION OF GUILT, HAROLD.

25
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:19,812
BESIDES, MY PRESENCE HAS BEEN
REQUESTED AT A MEETING OF THE
TOWN COUNCIL.

26
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:23,149
I GOT SOME 'SPLAININ' TO DO.

27
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,417
YOU WANT A RIDE DOWN?

28
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,719
(POLICE SIREN)

29
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:30,256
WON'T BE NECESSARY, HAROLD.
THERE'S MY RIDE NOW.

30
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:45,304
[QUIRKY UPBEAT MUSIC]

31
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:48,307
HERE ARE A FEW SCENES FROM
THIS PARTICULAR SHOW.

32
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,243
AND I DON'T LIKE
TO HYPE YOU TOO MUCH,

33
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:53,813
BUT, BY GOLLY, IF THIS
DOESN'T MAKE YOU WANT
TO WATCH THIS SHOW,

34
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,116
THEN, WELL, YOU OBVIOUSLY
HAVE A LIFE.

35
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:08,561
WELL, POSSUM LODGE DIDN'T GET
OFF TOO BAD, THERE, ON THE
LAWN MOWER FIASCO.

36
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,029
THE TOWN COUNCIL DIDN'T
FINE US OR ANYTHING.

37
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:13,332
THEY JUST FORCED US TO
ADOPT A HIGHWAY.

38
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:19,071
SO NOW WE ARE THE PROUD
CUSTODIANS OF THE THREE-MILE
STRETCH UP AT THE FAR END
OF THE LAKE.

39
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:21,841
YOU ADOPTED ORPHAN'S BEND?

40
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,209
YES, WE DID, HAROLD.

41
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,311
AND WE GOT SOME BIG, BIG,
BIG PLANS FOR HER...

42
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:30,082
GONNA JACK UP THE SPEED LIMIT,
BAN SENIORS, AND THROW A
TOLL BOOTH IN THERE.

43
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,853
NO, NO, NO, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO DO IT LIKE THAT, UNCLE RED.

44
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,591
YOUR JOB IS TO KEEP THAT PIECE
OF THE HIGHWAY CLEAN AND SAFE.

45
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:42,328
LIKE, ONE TIME, OUR JUNIOR
RANGERS TROOP, LIKE, ONE SUMMER,
RIGHT, WE ADOPHIGHWAY TOO,

46
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:43,896
AND FOR THE ENTIRE SUMMER
THAT WAS OUR JOB.

47
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,365
ON THE VERY FIRST DAY -- VERY
FIRST DAY -- FIRST DAY --

48
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:49,802
I CLEANED UP MORE CUPS AND TIN
CANS THAN ANYBODY ELSE,

49
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:55,608
SO FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE
MONTH, I GOT TO CLEAN UP THE
HIGHWAY WHILE EVERYBODY ELSE
WENT TO THE SWIMMING POOL.

50
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,443
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

51
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,645
NO, THAT'S OKAY.
MY MOM WOULDN'T LET ME
GO TO THE SWIMMING POOL.

52
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,447
YOU KNOW HOW EVERYBODY FLICKS
THEIR TOWELS AND STUFF?

53
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,549
YOU KNOW, THAT COULD INTERFERE
WITH MY ABILITY TO...

54
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,486
YOU KNOW...

55
00:03:07,553 --> 00:03:09,155
WALK?

56
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:10,389
NO, NOT WALK...

57
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:11,958
REPRODUCE?!

58
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,064
THAT COULD HAPPEN.
I PRAY A LOT.

59
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,634
YOU KNOW, HAROLD, I'M THINKING
YOU COULD USE A LITTLE EXERCISE.

60
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,537
WHY DON'T YOU COME UP TO THE
HIGHWAY AND HELP US CLEAN THAT
UP, JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE, EH?

61
00:03:24,603 --> 00:03:26,973
WELL, YEAH, I COULD DO THAT.
I GOT SOME SPARE TIME.

62
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,675
ALL RIGHT. AND WHEN YOU GET UP
THERE, HAROLD, JUST CLEAN IT
UP AS FAST AS YOU CAN, OKAY?

63
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,177
DON'T TALK TO THE
OTHER GUYS, ALL RIGHT?

64
00:03:31,243 --> 00:03:33,346
HOW COME?
'CAUSE THEY'LL
KILL YOU, HAROLD.

65
00:03:33,412 --> 00:03:36,982
(APPLAUSE)

66
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:40,152
OH, THE DEVIL
CHALLENGED EVEL KNIEVEL

67
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:43,122
TO A CONTEST OF
IMPOSSIBLE JUMPS

68
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,524
THE WINNER WOULD
GET A HELL OF A PRIZE

69
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:48,094
AND THE LOSER WOULD
TAKE HIS LUMPS

70
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,930
OH, THEY JUMPED A CANYON,
A MOUNTAIN AND A LAKE

71
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:53,532
AND A FIELD OF
HUNGRY BOLL WEEVILS

72
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,135
AND THE DEVIL DISCOVERED
TO HIS SURPRISE

73
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:59,105
HE WAS THE LESSER
OF TWO EVELS

74
00:04:01,006 --> 00:04:02,742
IT'S THE POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

75
00:04:02,808 --> 00:04:06,779
AND IF YOU LOVE BRITISH CARS,
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE TONIGHT'S
GRAND PRIZE...

76
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:09,181
A BUSINESS CARD FROM
FLINTY'S TOWING.

77
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:14,386
ALL RIGHT, UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE
30 SECONDS TO GET Mr. DALTON
HUMPHREY TO SAY THIS WORD...

78
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,960
PARANOID.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

79
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:23,462
ALL RIGHT, DALTON,
PERSECUTION COMPLEX...

80
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,264
THE COURTHOUSE.

81
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,833
NO, NO, THAT'S A
PROSECUTION COMPLEX.

82
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,738
OKAY, IF YOU'RE SUSPICIOUS OF
EVERYONE FOR ABSOLUTELY NO
APPARENT REASON,

83
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,206
THEN YOU WOULD SAY
THAT'S BEING...

84
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:36,909
NORMAL.

85
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:41,714
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. LET'S SAY
YOU'RE NEGATIVE, AND YOU HAVE NO
CONTACT WITH REALITY WHATSOEVER.

86
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,815
THAT WOULD BE...

87
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:43,716
MY DAUGHTER.

88
00:04:46,051 --> 00:04:47,786
LET'S GO ANOTHER WAY
ON THIS ONE, DALTON, OKAY?

89
00:04:47,853 --> 00:04:49,788
YOU GOT TWO SLIPPERS.
THAT MAKES A...

90
00:04:49,855 --> 00:04:50,923
PAIR.

91
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,458
OKAY. SOMEONE BUGS YOU,
YOU GET...

92
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:53,659
ANNOYED.

93
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,194
RIGHT! PUT 'EM TOGETHER.
PUT 'EM TOGETHER.

94
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,096
YOU SAYIN' SOMEONE'S HIDING MY
SLIPPERS TO ANNOY ME?

95
00:04:57,162 --> 00:04:59,932
YOU KNOW, IT'S PROBABLY
MY NEIGHBOUR.

96
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,667
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE
HE'S TRYIN' TO GET ME.

97
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:05,137
HE THINKS I SNEAK INTO
HIS HOUSE AT NIGHT AND
REARRANGE HIS FURNITURE.

98
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:07,239
ALL RIGHT, AND HE THINKS THAT
WAY BECAUSE HE'S...

99
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:09,008
CAUGHT ME DOIN' IT.

100
00:05:09,074 --> 00:05:13,245
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

101
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:16,615
(CRASH)

102
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,020
YOU KNOW HOW EVERY ONCE IN A
BLUE MOON THE WORLD GIVES
YOU CREDIT, HUH?

103
00:05:21,086 --> 00:05:23,522
IT HAPPENS TO ME
ONCE EVERY YEAR.

104
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:27,793
YOU KNOW ON THAT SPECIAL
GARBAGE DAY WHEN PEOPLE CAN
PUT OUT ANYTHING THEY WANT
OF ANY SIZE,

105
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,928
AND THE GARBAGE COLLECTORS
HAVE TO TAKE IT?

106
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:34,133
WELL, THAT'S THE DAY WHEN
EVERYBODY WISHES THEY HAD
A VAN LIKE MINE.

107
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,934
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

108
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:37,569
HUH? WHAT DO YOU SEE HERE, HUH?

109
00:05:38,904 --> 00:05:43,642
BATHTUBS, TAPS, SHOWER NOZZLES,
DRAINS , U-JOINTS...

110
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:46,812
NOW, I SUPPOSE YOU COULD USE
THIS STUFF TO PUT IN A GUEST
BATHROOM IN YOUR HOUSE,

111
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,113
BUT WHAT'LL THAT GET YOU?

112
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,381
GUESTS!

113
00:05:50,682 --> 00:05:53,852
I LOOK AT THIS STUFF, AND I SEE
COOKING OVER CHARCOAL.

114
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,788
THAT'S RIGHT... A BATH-E-QUE.

115
00:06:14,306 --> 00:06:16,308
ALL RIGHT, THERE'S OUR
BATH-E-QUE...

116
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,912
ONE TUB FOR THE BASE, ONE FOR
THE BAR-B-QUE, AND ONE
FOR THE LID.

117
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:21,713
NOW ALL WE GOTTA DO IS
ADD A HINGE ON THERE,

118
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,882
SO THE LID WILL
OPEN UP THIS WAY.

119
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:27,786
OKAY. WE COULD BOLT HINGES ON
THERE, BUT THAT WOULD INVOLVE
PROBABLY NINE HOURS OF WORK

120
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:29,421
PLUS STEALING A DRILL.

121
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:32,324
INSTEAD, I RECOMMEND THE
HANDYMAN'S SECRET WEAPON...

122
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,459
DUCT TAPE.

123
00:06:35,227 --> 00:06:36,895
HERE WE GO.

124
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:38,830
GIVE 'ER A TRY HERE.

125
00:06:38,897 --> 00:06:43,035
OH, MAN, I'LL TELL YA, YOU RAISE
THAT UP AND DOWN A FEW TIMES
COOKIN' A STEAK,

126
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:45,537
YOU'RE GONNA WORK UP
AN APPETITE.

127
00:06:45,604 --> 00:06:49,641
SOMETHIN' TO HOLD 'ER OPEN. OH,
THERE WE GO. SHOWER CURTAIN ROD
OUGHTA DO 'ER.

128
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:54,613
ALL RIGHT, NOW, WHAT IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT STEP WHEN YOU'RE
BUILDING A BATH-E-QUE?

129
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,715
BEFORE YOU FIRE 'ER UP,

130
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,686
YOU REALLY WANNA GET THE
BATH MAT OUT OF THERE.

131
00:07:00,752 --> 00:07:04,656
OTHERWISE, YOU COULD GET
YOURSELF A BAD CASE
OF ATHLETE'S FOOD.

132
00:07:04,723 --> 00:07:05,991
OKAY, NOW THE BIG QUESTION...

133
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:08,627
DO WE GO WITH GAS, OR DO
WE GO WITH CHARCOAL?

134
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:11,496
CHARCOAL'S REAL GOOD, YOU KNOW?
'CAUSE WHEN YOU'RE DONE,
YOU JUST SWEEP THE ASHES
RIGHT DOWN THE DRAIN.

135
00:07:11,563 --> 00:07:13,999
BUT, TODAY, WE'RE GONNA
GO TOP DRAWER.

136
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:17,102
WE'RE GONNA BUILD A BATH-E-QUE
THAT'S GONNA BE A GAS GRILL.

137
00:07:18,537 --> 00:07:19,971
ISN'T THAT SOMETHIN', HUH?

138
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:21,973
HERE WE GOT THE COPPER PIPES,
THERE, CARRYING THE GAS.

139
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,477
AND WE GOT SHOWER
NOZZLES AS BURNERS.

140
00:07:25,544 --> 00:07:28,747
ALL RIGHT. NOW THEY'RE
ALL HOOKED UP TO OUR
PROPANE UNIT, HERE.

141
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:31,216
BUY IN BULK, YOU'RE
GONNA SAVE BIG.

142
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:33,385
WELL, I GUESS IT'S TIME
TO FIRE 'ER UP.

143
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:35,387
OR, IN THIS CASE,
HIT THE SHOWERS.

144
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:37,022
(SOUND OF LEAKING PROPANE)

145
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,058
OH, MAN, THAT COULD USE A LITTLE
EXTRA COATING OF DUCT TAPE.

146
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,127
THERE WE GO.
THAT'S FINE.

147
00:07:42,194 --> 00:07:46,531
TELL YOU ANOTHER FEATURE OF THIS
UNIT, IT'S GOT THE ELECTRIC
SPARKER ON IT.

148
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,672
ALL RIGHT, I'VE ADDED A FEW
FEATURES TO HER THERE.

149
00:07:53,738 --> 00:07:56,141
I GOT THE CHEESE SLICES
ALL READY TO GO.

150
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,910
YOU WANNA LIMIT YOUR GUESTS TO,
MAYBE, TWO SLICES A PIECE
ON THAT.

151
00:07:58,977 --> 00:08:01,379
THEN WE GOT THE SHOWER RACK,
HERE, WITH OUR SHAMPOO BOTTLES,

152
00:08:01,446 --> 00:08:04,382
BUT I'VE EMPTIED THEM OUT,
AND I'VE PUT THE KETCHUP
IN THIS ONE, AND THE
MUSTARD IN THIS UNIT,

153
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:07,152
AND WE'VE GOT THE SPECIAL
BATH-E-QUE SAUCE IN HERE.

154
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:08,653
AND HERE'S AN EXTRA LITTLE
FEATURE I'VE ADDED...

155
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,156
A COLD WATER TAP, THERE, HOOKED
INTO A COLD WATER SHOWER;

156
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:12,591
KINDA DEAL WITH THE
FLARE-UPS, YOU KNOW?

157
00:08:12,657 --> 00:08:14,759
KEEP THE FLAMES DOWN IN THERE
'CAUSE I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHIN',

158
00:08:14,826 --> 00:08:18,163
NOTHIN' TAKES THE FIRE OUT
OF YOUR LOIN CHOPS LIKE
A COLD SHOWER.

159
00:08:18,797 --> 00:08:20,432
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE ASKIN'
"WHAT'S COOKIN'?"

160
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:22,133
WELL, COME TAKE A LOOK.

161
00:08:24,502 --> 00:08:26,838
LOOK AT THAT. IS THAT
BEAUTIFUL OR WHAT?

162
00:08:26,905 --> 00:08:29,274
SEE, YOU GOT THE
HOT DOGS ON THERE,

163
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:31,743
AND OVER HERE, COURSE,
WE GOT OUR CHICKEN.

164
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,946
AND, BY GOLLY, I THINK YOU
KNOW EVERYBODY LOVES A
BURGER, DON'T THEY?

165
00:08:35,013 --> 00:08:40,452
EITHER PLAIN OR, HEY, LET'S GO
FIRST CLASS HERE:  THROW A
HUNK OF CHEESE ON THERE.

166
00:08:40,518 --> 00:08:42,721
OH-HO-HO, WE GOT OUR
CONDIMENTS IN THIS AREA HERE.

167
00:08:42,787 --> 00:08:44,956
AND I'LL TELL YA SOMETHIN',

168
00:08:45,023 --> 00:08:49,261
YOU GOTTA REMEMBER, IF WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME, THEY
SHOULD AT LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

169
00:08:49,327 --> 00:08:51,363
LOOK AT THAT. THERE'S AN
AMERICAN STANDARD.

170
00:08:57,002 --> 00:09:00,171
I WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE AND
TALK TO SOME OF YOU OLDER
FELLAS OUT THERE.

171
00:09:00,238 --> 00:09:06,511
MAYBE ANOTHER DRIVER CALLED YOU
A MORON, OR YOU HAD A BIT OF A
RUN-IN WITH A BAD SALES CLERK,

172
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:10,515
MAYBE AN ANNOYING CO-WORKER,
OR EVEN A ROTTEN RELATIVE,

173
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:13,051
AND YOU START ASKIN'
YOURSELF THE QUESTION,

174
00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:16,821
"AM I TOTALLY SURROUNDED
BY STUPID PEOPLE?"

175
00:09:19,557 --> 00:09:20,759
THE ANSWER, OF COURSE, IS...

176
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:22,727
YES.

177
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:24,496
OH, YEAH.

178
00:09:24,562 --> 00:09:28,266
YOU KNOW, YOU ARE ONE OF THE
LAST SMART PEOPLE LEFT
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

179
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:33,071
NOW, KIDS TODAY DON'T KNOW NEAR
AS MUCH AS YOU DID WHEN YOU
WERE THEIR AGE.

180
00:09:33,138 --> 00:09:37,475
EVERY GENERATION OF RELATIVES
IS DENSER THAN THE LAST.

181
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:42,280
HECK, THEY'RE NOT EVEN MAKIN'
DOGS AS SMART AS THEY USED TO.

182
00:09:42,347 --> 00:09:46,818
YOU, SIR, ARE THE LAST
OUTPOST OF INTELLIGENCE.

183
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:48,620
YOU LET THEM CALL YOU AN IDIOT.

184
00:09:48,686 --> 00:09:50,221
LET THEM LAUGH AT YOU, EH?

185
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:53,424
WHO'S THE GUY THAT GOT 17 YEARS
OUT OF THAT CAR, HUH?

186
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,063
WHO'S THE GUY WITH THE
GREENEST LAWN ON THE STREET?

187
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,934
AND AREN'T YOU THE GUY THAT GOT
ALL YOUR CHRISTMAS SHOPPING
DONE IN JULY...

188
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:05,236
AT A YARD SALE?

189
00:10:06,538 --> 00:10:08,473
SO WHO'S THE IDIOT NOW?

190
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,074
WHO'S THE MORON NOW?

191
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:12,110
AND IF YOU'RE AS SMART
AS YOU THINK YOU ARE,

192
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:14,445
YOU WON'T ANSWER
THOSE QUESTIONS.

193
00:10:14,512 --> 00:10:16,748
REMEMBER, US MORONS ARE
PULLIN' FOR YOU.

194
00:10:16,814 --> 00:10:18,383
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

195
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:22,654
(APPLAUSE)

196
00:10:25,056 --> 00:10:27,625
ALL HAIL THE HIGHWAYMAN,
RED GREEN!

197
00:10:27,692 --> 00:10:29,928
(APPLAUSE)

198
00:10:29,994 --> 00:10:32,530
KNOCK IT OFF.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

199
00:10:32,597 --> 00:10:35,800
HE'S JUST GOOFIN' AROUND.

200
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:37,769
YOU CAN LAUGH ALL
YOU WANT, HAROLD.

201
00:10:37,835 --> 00:10:41,539
I'M TELLIN' YOU, THIS
ADOPT-A-HIGHWAY THING,
WHAT A GOLD MINE!

202
00:10:41,606 --> 00:10:43,174
I GOT THREE BUCKS
IN BOTTLES HERE.

203
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:45,209
I'VE GOT FIVE HUBCAPS,

204
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:47,512
AND SOME KIDS ON A
SCHOOL BUS TRIED TO
WING AN APPLE
AT HAROLD,

205
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:49,347
AND I CAUGHT IT.

206
00:10:50,782 --> 00:10:52,617
STILL GOT THE
SOFT HANDS.

207
00:10:52,684 --> 00:10:53,918
I'VE STILL GOT THE HARD HEAD.

208
00:10:55,953 --> 00:11:00,158
UNCLE RED, THAT OPERATION OUT
THERE IS A CLEANUP OPERATION,
NOT A SCAVENGER HUNT.

209
00:11:00,224 --> 00:11:02,126
WELL, HAROLD, IT CAN
BE A BIT OF BOTH.

210
00:11:02,193 --> 00:11:04,862
AT LEAST,
IT CAN NOW.

211
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:06,431
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE FIRST GOT UP
THERE, YOU KNOW, THE DARN PLACE
WAS SO CLEAN, THERE WAS NOTHING
FOR US TO DO.

212
00:11:06,497 --> 00:11:08,366
YEAH, SO, WHAT DO THEY DO --
WHAT DO THEY DO?

213
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:11,536
THEY TAKE ALL THE GARBAGE OUT OF
THEIR VEHICLES AND DUMP IT ON
THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.

214
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,605
BUT WHAT A LOCATION!
HOLY MACKEREL!

215
00:11:14,672 --> 00:11:17,208
THERE'S A LOT OF ADVANTAGES
WHEN YOU OWN YOUR OWN HIGHWAY.

216
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:20,778
WHOA-A-HA. YOU DO NOT
OWN THE HIGHWAY.

217
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:23,715
WELL, I DRIVE
LIKE I DO.

218
00:11:23,781 --> 00:11:25,716
BUT LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITY
HERE, HAROLD, EH?

219
00:11:25,783 --> 00:11:28,686
HOLY SMOKE. PEOPLE SLOW DOWN
FOR ORPHAN'S BEND ANYHOW,

220
00:11:28,753 --> 00:11:31,189
WHY NOT HAVE 'EM STOP
AND SHOP, EH?

221
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:32,990
WE COULD HAVE...
A SOUVENIR SHOP,
HOT DOG STAND,

222
00:11:33,057 --> 00:11:36,561
TIRE RETREADING THERE,
THE BLACK VELVET PAINTINGS.

223
00:11:36,627 --> 00:11:37,462
THIS IS NOT JUST A ROAD,

224
00:11:37,528 --> 00:11:41,232
THIS IS A FOUR-LANE MALL.

225
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:44,802
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE CLEANING
UP THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,
NOT DEVELOPING IT.

226
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:48,172
YOU GOTTA
THINK BIG, HAROLD.

227
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:51,142
YOU GUYS AREN'T
EQUIPPED TO THINK BIG.

228
00:11:54,178 --> 00:11:55,646
WHO SAID THAT?

229
00:11:58,983 --> 00:12:04,856
WELL, GET YOURSELVES
COMFORTABLE BECAUSE WE GOT
A REAL AMBITIOUS ADVENTURE
WITH BILL TODAY.

230
00:12:04,922 --> 00:12:07,491
HE'S GONNA TRY AND MOVE
THAT STUMP THERE.

231
00:12:07,558 --> 00:12:13,197
THAT STUMP'S BEEN THERE BEHIND
THE LODGE SINCE, AH, WELL,
SINCE OLD MAN SEDGEWICK
WAS AROUND 70.

232
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:14,899
SO IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

233
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:17,134
AND THESE ARE A
BUNCH OF TOOLS.

234
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:20,304
ACTUALLY, THESE ARE JUST A
FEW ODDS AND ENDS THAT I
CARRY IN MY VAN.

235
00:12:20,371 --> 00:12:22,673
THERE'S ANOTHER LESSON
FOR YOU YOUNGSTERS...

236
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,509
HAVE SOME TOOLS IN THE BACK OF
YOUR VAN AT ALL TIMES.

237
00:12:25,576 --> 00:12:28,679
REALLY HELPS THE TRACTION
IN THE WINTER.

238
00:12:28,746 --> 00:12:30,881
DIDN'T REALIZE THAT I HAD
THAT MANY IN THERE.

239
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:34,151
THAT'S SOME SERIOUS CHOPPIN'.

240
00:12:34,218 --> 00:12:38,055
ALL RIGHT, JUST START
CHOPPIN' AWAY ON 'ER THERE.

241
00:12:38,122 --> 00:12:42,693
MY GOSH, HE'S SAYIN' SHE'S A
LITTLE SPONGY -- GET 'ER
OUTTA THERE.

242
00:12:44,228 --> 00:12:47,732
OKAY, SWITCH TO THE PICKAXE.
GET THAT OUTA THERE.

243
00:12:47,798 --> 00:12:49,800
OKAY, LET ME HELP
YOU THERE, BILL.

244
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:51,202
ONE AND TWO AND...

245
00:12:51,268 --> 00:12:52,903
PULL!

246
00:12:54,972 --> 00:12:58,843
YEP, A FEW TOOLS LODGED INTO
THE STUMP AT THIS POINT.

247
00:12:58,909 --> 00:13:03,080
HE WAS TRYIN' TO DRILL
A HOLE FOR THE DYNAMITE,
BUT HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.

248
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:04,115
NOW, DON'T, BILL.
DON'T DO THAT.

249
00:13:06,183 --> 00:13:07,985
(EXPLOSION)

250
00:13:08,052 --> 00:13:11,288
YEP, YOU'VE DETONATED IT.

251
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:13,824
NOPE, EVERYTHING'S FINE.

252
00:13:13,891 --> 00:13:16,127
BY GOLLY, LOOK AT THAT.
WE GOT RID OF ALL THE TOOLS.

253
00:13:16,193 --> 00:13:17,728
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

254
00:13:17,795 --> 00:13:21,198
OH, HERE THEY COME NOW.

255
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:26,470
VERY DANGEROUS TO WORK WITH
BILL ON A CLOSE BASIS, THERE.

256
00:13:26,537 --> 00:13:29,273
WELL, THE CHAINSAW WASN'T
RUNNIN', SO IT WASN'T
REALLY THAT BAD.

257
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,474
ALL RIGHT, WHAT NOW, BILL?

258
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,276
OKAY, NOW WE HOOK UP A ROPE.

259
00:13:32,343 --> 00:13:34,545
AND THIS IS THE BEAUTY
OF HAVING A UNIT LIKE
THE POSSUM VAN.

260
00:13:34,612 --> 00:13:36,013
YOU GOT THE BIG EIGHT
IN THERE --

261
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:38,816
I WOULDN'T STAND ON
THAT ROPE, BILL.

262
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:41,485
DON'T STAND ON THE ROPE.
YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET OFF THAT.

263
00:13:41,552 --> 00:13:42,987
GET OFF IT.

264
00:13:44,121 --> 00:13:46,257
THERE, YOU'RE OFF IT NOW.

265
00:13:46,323 --> 00:13:50,995
O-O-H, BY GOLLY, YOU KNOW,
I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THAT
ON A FULL STOMACH.

266
00:13:51,061 --> 00:13:53,364
YOU ALL RIGHT THERE, BILL?

267
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:57,234
OH, JUST POPPED HIS ARM OUT OF
HIS SLEEVE AND PROBABLY OUT
OF HIS SHOULDER.

268
00:13:57,301 --> 00:13:58,736
OH, NO, HE'S FINE.

269
00:13:58,802 --> 00:14:00,471
HERE'S ANOTHER THING FOR
YOU YOUNGSTERS...

270
00:14:00,538 --> 00:14:03,007
YOU DON'T QUIT;
YOU TRY ANOTHER WAY.

271
00:14:03,073 --> 00:14:05,242
TERMITES!
TERMITES!

272
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:07,444
SO BILL'S GOT A CAN
OF TERMITES THERE.

273
00:14:07,511 --> 00:14:12,316
JUST SPRINKLE A FEW AROUND.
I THINK YOU'LL NEED MORE
THAN THAT, BILL.

274
00:14:12,383 --> 00:14:13,751
PRETTY BIG STUMP.

275
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:16,754
TAKE A LOT OF TERMITES,
I WOULD THINK.

276
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:20,691
THERE, NOW YOU'RE TALKIN'.
NOW YOU'RE TALKIN.

277
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:23,627
THERE YOU GO.

278
00:14:23,694 --> 00:14:26,397
SPARE THE TERMITES; SPOIL
THE STUMP. THAT'S WHAT WE SAY.

279
00:14:26,463 --> 00:14:28,866
GONNA TAKE A WHILE,
BILL, I THINK.

280
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:31,435
DON'T BE IMPATIENT, NOW.

281
00:14:31,502 --> 00:14:36,106
WELL, IT'S BEEN 10-20 MINUTES.
I'LL GIVE 'ER A TRY.

282
00:14:36,173 --> 00:14:37,308
DOESN'T LOOK TOO BAD.

283
00:14:40,544 --> 00:14:43,213
ALL RIGHT, AND NOW WE'RE
GONNA TRY ANOTHER APPROACH.

284
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,651
WE GOT THE CHAIN AROUND THE
TREE, AND THIS IS A SPECIAL
DEAL WE'RE GONNA DO.

285
00:14:47,718 --> 00:14:50,087
WE'RE GONNA PUT A ROPE AROUND
SOMETHING REAL SOLID.

286
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:53,757
WHAT COULD BE MORE SOLID THAN
ONE OF THE OLD STONE HOUSES
DOWN AT THE END OF
THE LANE WAY?

287
00:14:53,824 --> 00:14:57,394
THESE PEOPLE GO TO
FLORIDA EVERY WINTER.

288
00:14:57,461 --> 00:14:59,663
THEY GOT A BIG SURPRISE WHEN
THEY GET HOME, I'LL BET.

289
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:04,902
ANYWAY, WE HOOK THAT UP TO THE
CHAIN ON THE STUMP, AND THAT
LITTLE TOOL BILL HAS THERE --

290
00:15:04,968 --> 00:15:07,638
I MEAN, THE ONE THAT'S IN
HIS HAND -- THAT'S CALLED
A COME-ALONG.

291
00:15:07,704 --> 00:15:10,841
WE'RE GONNA USE THAT TO KIND
OF WINCH THAT STUMP.

292
00:15:10,908 --> 00:15:15,145
IT'S STARTIN' TO COME UP SNUG,
AND WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NOW
IS IT'LL PULL THAT STUMP
RIGHT OUT OF THE GROUND.

293
00:15:15,212 --> 00:15:17,548
NOW, HERE'S ANOTHER THING
FOR YOU YOUNGSTERS.

294
00:15:17,614 --> 00:15:19,583
WE NEED A LITTLE MORE OF WHAT
THEY CALL LEVERAGE.

295
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,486
LEVERAGE:  THAT'S SOMETHIN' YOU
NEED WHEN YOU GO TO THE BANK.

296
00:15:22,553 --> 00:15:24,588
AND YOU PUT THAT ON THERE, AND
YOU CAN REALLY...

297
00:15:24,655 --> 00:15:26,290
O-O-O-H.

298
00:15:28,725 --> 00:15:32,996
ALL RIGHT, WELL, THIS IS --
THIS IS PROBABLY NOT...

299
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:40,571
NO, I DON'T THINK THAT'S
GONNA WORK, BILL.

300
00:15:41,305 --> 00:15:43,140
I KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO...

301
00:15:43,207 --> 00:15:44,575
LET'S LEAVE.

302
00:15:50,948 --> 00:15:53,183
YOU KNOW, YOU TRY TO
HELP YOUR COMMUNITY;

303
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,818
MAYBE STIMULATE
THE LOCAL ECONOMY;

304
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:56,320
SHOW A LITTLE IMAGINATION.

305
00:15:56,386 --> 00:15:57,521
WHERE DOES IT GET YOU?

306
00:15:57,588 --> 00:16:01,191
TROUBLE AT
ORPHAN'S BEND?

307
00:16:01,258 --> 00:16:03,126
YOU KNOW, WE GOT SUCH A
GREAT THING GOIN' UP THERE,

308
00:16:03,193 --> 00:16:05,162
AND THEN SOMEBODY
GOES AND COMPLAINS.

309
00:16:06,396 --> 00:16:08,265
REALLY?

310
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:17,574
WELL, YOU KNOW, I HEARD YOU GUYS
HAD SO MUCH STUFF AT THE SIDES
OF THE HIGHWAY, THAT IT'S
DOWN TO ONE LANE, HUH?

311
00:16:17,641 --> 00:16:19,743
HAROLD, WE GOT A TOURIST
ATTRACTION GOIN' THERE, EH?

312
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,645
YOU KNOW, ONE TIME
THE MAYOR SAID TO ME,

313
00:16:21,712 --> 00:16:24,715
"HOW COME EVERY TOURIST
WHO STOPS AT POSSUM LAKE
HAS CAR TROUBLE?"

314
00:16:24,781 --> 00:16:26,550
THAT'S BECAUSE, IF THEY
DIDN'T HAVE CAR TROUBLE,

315
00:16:26,616 --> 00:16:29,453
THEY WOULDN'T STOP HERE.

316
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,357
SO WE FINALLY HAVE A BONA FIDE
REASON TO STOP, AND EVERYBODY'S
GIVIN' US GRIEF.

317
00:16:33,423 --> 00:16:36,293
WELL, YOU KNOW, MAYBE IT'S
THE RIGHT IDEA, JUST THE
WRONG LOCATION.

318
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,797
THE SIDE OF A HIGHWAY MIGHT
NOT BE THE BEST PLACE
FOR A THEME PARK.

319
00:16:40,864 --> 00:16:42,399
OH, HAROLD, IT MAKES
SO MUCH SENSE THERE.

320
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:44,267
WE GOT REFRESHMENTS;
WE GOT WASHROOMS;

321
00:16:44,334 --> 00:16:46,103
WE GOT THIS DRIVE-THROUGH
MIDWAY;

322
00:16:46,169 --> 00:16:50,640
WE GOT A BIG CARDBOARD CUTOUT OF
AN ELEPHANT WITH A GARBAGE PAIL
HANGIN' FROM HIS TAIL.

323
00:16:50,707 --> 00:16:53,443
CARS DRIVE UP.
YOU PAY A BUCK.
YOU THROW YOUR GARBAGE.

324
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:57,147
YOU HIT JUMBO IN THE CAN,
YOU WIN A DUST BUSTER.

325
00:16:57,214 --> 00:17:00,016
I'M TELLIN' YOU, HAROLD,
ORPHAN'S BEND IS DANGEROUS.

326
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,184
NOW THEY SLOW DOWN.

327
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:03,086
WE'VE ACTUALLY MADE IT SAFE.

328
00:17:03,153 --> 00:17:06,656
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? THESE ARE
THE KINDS OF THINGS YOU SHOULD
BE SAYING TO THE TOWN COUNCIL.

329
00:17:06,723 --> 00:17:09,226
WELL, AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I'M GOING DOWN THERE
IN A FEW MINUTES,

330
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:11,762
BUT I'M NOT GONNA LET THEM
SHUT US DOWN, HAROLD.

331
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:15,065
I WANT YOU TO MEET ME IN THE
POSSUM VAN UP AT ORPHAN'S
BEND IN A COUPLE OF HOURS.

332
00:17:15,132 --> 00:17:17,834
WE'LL MAKE A ROADBLOCK
IF WE HAVE TO.

333
00:17:19,803 --> 00:17:22,606
OKAY, OKAY, WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO
DROP YOU OFF DOWNTOWN ON MY WAY?

334
00:17:22,672 --> 00:17:24,207
(POLICE SIREN)

335
00:17:24,274 --> 00:17:25,442
NOT NECESSARY, HAROLD.

336
00:17:30,514 --> 00:17:32,983
THIS IS THE REPAIR SHOP PART
OF THE SHOW WE CALL,

337
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:35,252
"IF IT AIN'T BROKE,
YOU'RE NOT TRYIN'".

338
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,856
EDGAR MONTROSE, HERE, HAS
BROUGHT IN SOMETHIN'
FOR US TO FIX.

339
00:17:39,923 --> 00:17:42,392
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
FOR US, EDGAR?

340
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:44,160
OH, NO THANKS, RED.

341
00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:51,534
MY MOM WANTED HER
DINING ROOM SET REFINISHED.

342
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:55,805
I STARTED IT, BUT I WAS KINDA
HOPING YOU'D HELP ME FINISH.

343
00:17:55,872 --> 00:17:58,074
WELL, I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

344
00:17:58,141 --> 00:17:59,542
WELL, YOU GOT 'ER BURNED
UP THE SIDE, THERE.

345
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:02,212
WHAT WERE YOU DOING, USING A
HEAT GUN ON THE VARNISH, THERE?

346
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:06,383
NO, THAT WAS FROM THE EXPLOSION.

347
00:18:06,449 --> 00:18:08,818
DO YOU WANNA TELL US
ABOUT THAT, EDGAR?

348
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:14,024
NO, RED, IT'S NOT
MY PROUDEST MOMENT.

349
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,059
ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL SKIP IT.

350
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:18,094
WELL, HERE YOU CAN
USE DUCT TAPE.

351
00:18:18,161 --> 00:18:21,498
YOU STICK IT ON THE VARNISH, AND
YOU PEEL IT OFF SLOW, AND SHE'LL
JUST LIFT RIGHT OFF THERE.

352
00:18:21,564 --> 00:18:23,533
OH, NO, NO, NO, I DON'T WANT
TO REFINISH THAT CHAIR.

353
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,703
I JUST BROUGHT IT IN
AS A REFERENCE.

354
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:30,674
SEE, I WANNA REPAIR THE
OTHER THREE CHAIRS SO
THEY MATCH THIS ONE,

355
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,410
SO THEY'RE A
COMPLETE SET AGAIN.

356
00:18:33,476 --> 00:18:38,915
OH, THE REST OF THE DINING ROOM
SET THAT WAS MAYBE HURT BY
THAT EXPLOSION YOU DON'T
WANNA TALK ABOUT.

357
00:18:38,982 --> 00:18:40,183
YEAH, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

358
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,119
YOU GO GET THE
OTHER CHAIRS.
OH, OKAY.

359
00:18:43,186 --> 00:18:47,057
BUT, HERE AGAIN, EVEN WITH
REPAIR WORK, YOU CAN USE THE
DUCT TAPE ON THAT

360
00:18:47,123 --> 00:18:55,732
BECAUSE THE SPINDLES, SOMETIMES
THEY GET LOOSE, OR YOU CAN DO
THE CANING WORK, OR EVEN IF
YOU GOT A, YOU KNOW...

361
00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:01,738
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

362
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:21,658
SO, AH, ARE THESE THE
OTHER THREE CHAIRS?

363
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:26,229
AND THE DINING ROOM TABLE.

364
00:19:28,431 --> 00:19:31,134
JUST LET ME SAY,
IN MY DEFENSE,

365
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:36,873
THAT CHEMICAL PAINT STRIPPER
AND NITROGLYCERIN

366
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,342
ARE BOTH CLEAR LIQUIDS.

367
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:44,914
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

368
00:19:48,718 --> 00:19:55,858
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

369
00:19:58,094 --> 00:20:00,630
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

370
00:20:00,697 --> 00:20:04,300
YOU'RE NEVER TOO OLD
TO LEARN THINGS.

371
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:06,636
ARE YOU EVER
TOO OLD TO LISTEN?

372
00:20:06,703 --> 00:20:10,039
YOU NEVER LISTEN, SO I GUESS
THE ANSWER'S 'YES' TO THAT ONE.

373
00:20:10,106 --> 00:20:11,040
I LISTEN, HAROLD.

374
00:20:11,107 --> 00:20:12,775
OH, REALLY?
OH, REALLY?
OH, REALLY?

375
00:20:12,842 --> 00:20:15,144
WELL, DID YOU
HEAR MY ADVICE?

376
00:20:15,211 --> 00:20:17,013
DID YOU HEAR THE
WARNING OF THE POLICEMAN?

377
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,483
DID YOU HEAR THE HORN
OF THE ONCOMING TRUCK?

378
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:24,120
OKAY, OKAY, NOW THIS IS
A GOOD POINT, ALL RIGHT?

379
00:20:24,187 --> 00:20:27,490
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO NEVER PAID
ATTENTION IN PHYSICS CLASS,

380
00:20:27,557 --> 00:20:31,894
A MOVING OBJECT CAN HAVE
A GREAT DEAL OF MOMENTUM;

381
00:20:31,961 --> 00:20:36,799
FOR EXAMPLE, A LOGGING TRUCK
DOING A HUNDRED CLICKS.

382
00:20:36,866 --> 00:20:39,469
YES, YES, THAT WOULD, INDEED,
HAVE MORE MOMENTUM THAN, SAY,

383
00:20:39,535 --> 00:20:42,538
OH, A PARKED POSSUM VAN.

384
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,543
IN FAIRNESS, IT WAS ONLY
PARKED UNTIL THE IMPACT.

385
00:20:48,678 --> 00:20:51,114
NOW, IS THAT WHEN THE
LOGS BROKE LOOSE?

386
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,516
I DUNNO. IT'S HARD TO SAY.

387
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:57,720
ALL I KNOW IS I HAVEN'T HAD THAT
MUCH BARK BETWEEN MY LEGS SINCE
MOOSE THOMPSON'S ROTTWEILER
WENT INTO HEAT.

388
00:20:57,787 --> 00:21:01,824
(LAUGHTER)

389
00:21:06,496 --> 00:21:08,498
WELL, THE CONCESSION BOOTHS
WERE ALL WRECKED,

390
00:21:08,564 --> 00:21:09,866
BUT THE TRUCK WAS FINE

391
00:21:09,932 --> 00:21:13,469
BECAUSE THE HOT DOG BUNS
TOOK MOST OF THE HIT.

392
00:21:13,536 --> 00:21:15,771
BOY, IS THE HIGHWAY
EVER A MESS, THOUGH.

393
00:21:15,838 --> 00:21:18,608
WORSE THAN BEFORE YOU
GUYS EVEN ADOPTED IT.

394
00:21:18,674 --> 00:21:20,843
YOU GOT A LOT OF CLEANUP
THERE, UNCLE RED.

395
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,345
WELL, I TOOK CARE OF IT, HAROLD.

396
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:23,913
I SPOKE TO THE JUNIOR RANGERS,

397
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,615
AND I GAVE THEM
YOUR HOME NUMBER.

400
00:21:30,186 --> 00:21:32,521
YEAH, YOU GO AHEAD, HAROLD.
I'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.

401
00:21:32,588 --> 00:21:33,990
WATCH YOURSELF, NOW.

402
00:21:36,058 --> 00:21:39,829
WELL, IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING,

403
00:21:39,896 --> 00:21:42,231
AND I'M KINDA FED UP
NOW WITH ORPHAN'S BEND,

404
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:44,467
AND NOW I'D LIKE TO TRY
MY HAND AT WIFE'S CURVE.

405
00:21:45,768 --> 00:21:47,603
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

406
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,573

AND THE WHOLE GANG UP HERE
AT THE LODGE,
