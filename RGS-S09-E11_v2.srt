1
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:03,603
THIS HERE IS A TWO-MAN SAW,

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,071
AND I'M ONLY ONE MAN.

3
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:06,673
SEE THE PROBLEM?

4
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:10,176
AND I'M THE KINDA GUY WHO'D
RATHER FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO DO THIS BY MYSELF

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,946
THAN TO ASK SOMEBODY FOR HELP
AND THEN OWE THEM A FAVOUR

6
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,781
WHERE I'VE GOTTA
LEND 'EM A TOOL

7
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:17,484
OR FIND A BLIND DATE
FOR THEIR SISTER.

8
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,252
SO I'VE COME UP WITH
THE RED GREEN

9
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:21,588
ONE-MAN TWO-MAN SAW.

10
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:23,690
FIRST OF ALL,
ON THE ONE HANDLE,

11
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:26,359
YOU WANNA HOOK
A COUPLE OF BUNGEE CORDS,

12
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:29,095
AND THEN ATTACH THEM
TO SOMETHING FIXED,

13
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,663
NOT YOUR CAT.

14
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,465
THEN ON THE OTHER HANDLE,

15
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,634
THROW A HUNK OF
CHAIN ON THERE.

16
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:38,438
NOW, YOU NEED A WAY TO HOOK
THIS CHAIN ONTO ONE OF
YOUR WHEEL NUTS

17
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,874
SO THAT IT WON'T SLIP OFF.

18
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:43,343
SEE, NO PROBLEM
FOR THE CREATIVE HANDYMAN.

19
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,581
AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH
ALL THERE IS TO IT.

20
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:50,950
HEY, IF YOU HAVE ONE OF THOSE
NON-SLIP DEFERENTIALS,

21
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,586
GIVE ME A CALL
BEFORE YOU TRY THIS.

22
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,288
I REALLY ENJOY A GOOD LAUGH.

23
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,292
AND LIKE SO MANY GOOD
THINGS IN LIFE,

24
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:01,895
IT'S BETTER IF YOU START SLOW
AND THEN SPEED UP LATER.

25
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:16,309
[applause]

26
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:20,046
[cheers and applause]

27
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,955
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

28
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,223
YEAH, APPRECIATE THAT.

29
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,358
BIG SCHAMOZZLE UP
AT THE LODE THIS WEEK.

30
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,627
HAROLD BROUGHT A BUNCH OF
EXECUTIVE PENCIL NECKS

31
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:37,597
UP FROM THAT COMPANY
HE WORKS FOR IN THE CITY.

32
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,399
THEY'VE BEEN STAYIN'
AT THE LODGE ALL WEEK.

33
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:40,967
THEY'RE LIKE ACCOUNTANTS,

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,703
BUT WITHOUT ALL
THE PERSONALITY.

35
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,572
EXCUSE ME, UNCLE RED.
I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU.

36
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:47,574
I GOTTA TALK TO YOU.

37
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,578
DID THE MASSEUSE DROP
THE CAPPUCCINO MAKER
IN TO THE SPA?

38
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:53,413
NO, NO, I JUST WONDERED.

39
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,615
WHAT IS THAT SMELL COMING FROM
STINKY PETERSON'S CABIN?

40
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:58,251
STINKY PETERSON.

41
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,621
WELL, ISN'T THAT DANGEROUS
OR TOXIC OR SOMETHING?

42
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:03,823
WELL, WE MONITOR IT
PRETTY CLOSELY, HAROLD.

43
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,493
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE
CANARIES HANGING BY
THE DOOR THERE.

44
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,695
PLUS, YOU KNOW,
WHEN HE'S NOT THERE,

45
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,363
THE SMELL IS GONE.

46
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,299
OKAY, OKAY, SO IT'S
NOT THE CABIN ITSELF?
NO. NO.

47
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:16,436
I THINK THE AROMA'S
LIKE A LIVING ORGANISM

48
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:20,073
THAT IS USING
STINKY AS A HOST.

49
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,442
PBS SHOULD GET
HIM ON NOVA.

50
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,178
A LOT OF MY GUYS
ARE RATHER CONCERNED.

51
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:26,446
WELL, OF COURSE
THEY ARE, HAROLD,

52
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:29,015
BECAUSE THEY ARE
YUPPIE WHINERS.

53
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:31,451
N-NO!

54
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,219
DON'T EVEN --
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

55
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,088
YOU KNOW WE DON'T EVEN
WANNA BE HERE EITHER.

56
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:37,123
IT'S JUST THAT THIS IS THE ONLY
RESORT THAT WASN'T BOOKED,

57
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,392
AND, YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
YOU'D APPRECIATE THE MONEY.

58
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:40,994
I DON'T MIND
THE MONEY.

59
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,363
I JUST DON'T WANT TO HAVE
TO DO ANYTHING FOR IT.

60
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:44,864
EXCELLENT.
THAT'S PERFECT.

61
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,866
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT MY BOSS
WAS HOPING YOU WOULD SAY.

62
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,502

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,670

00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,748

SEPTIC SUCKING SERVICES.

79
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,761
Mr. GREEN, YOU HAVE 30 SEC --
COVER YOUR EARS.

80
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,598
YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS TO

SAY THIS WORD...

81
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,803
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

82
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,338
AND GO!

83
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,240
ALL RIGHT, WINSTON,
THIS IS A REALLY BAD THING.

84
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,008
LEAKY HIP WADERS?

85
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,576
NO, NO, NO.
OKAY.

86
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,812
OKAY, WHEN THERE'S A FLOOD,
WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT?

87
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,147
A CHANCE TO SELL MY BOAT.

88
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:11,284
SAY THE LODGE BURNS DOWN,
AND I LOSE EVERYTHING,

89
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,819
WHAT WOULD THAT BE FOR ME?

90
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,320
A FRESH START.

91
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,855
NO, NO, NO.

92
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,123
OKAY, WHAT DO
YOU THINK OF

93
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,158
WHEN YOU THINK OF HURRICANES,
EARTHQUAKES, TORNADOES?

94
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,760
RESORT HOLIDAY!

95
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,929
NO, I'M TALKIN' ABOUT
PEOPLE HURT BADLY,

96
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,464
THROWN OUT ON THE STREET.

97
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,566
MIDDLE-AGED GUYS
TRYING TO ROLLER BLADE.

98
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:29,902
THE TITANIC HIT
THAT ICEBERG, RIGHT?

99
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,272
THEY SAID THAT WAS THE WORST
SOMETHING OF ALL TIME.

100
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,140
DRIVING?

101
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,676
ALMOST OUTTA TIME,
Mr. GREEN.

102
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,746
WINSTON, YOU REMEMBER YOU
DATED THAT AROMATHERAPIST?

103
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,514
OH, DISASTER.

104
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,783
[applause]

105
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,258
IF IT AIN'T BROKE,
YOU'RE NOT TRYIN'.

106
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,228
JOININ' US TODAY IS LOCAL
EXPLOSIVES ENTHUSIAST,

107
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,764
EDGAR K. B. MONTROSE.

108
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,365
WHAT YOU GOT
FOR US, EDGAR?

109
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,000
YEAH, IT IS A
BEAUTIFUL DAY,

110
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,869
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHY I'M HERE.

111
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:06,306
I NEED YOU TO FIX MY
EXPLOSIVES LOCATOR.

112
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:09,509
OH, THIS THING FINDS
EXPLOSIVES, EDGAR?

113
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:12,378
WELL, IT WILL
AFTER YOU FIX IT.

114
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:13,780
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
YEAH.

115
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,114
IT'S A SAFETY TOOL.

116
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,684
IT HELPS ME FIND EXPLOSIVES THAT
I MIGHT HAVE LEFT LYING AROUND,

117
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,554
OR MAYBE JUST FELL OUT OF MY
POCKET WHEN I WAS RUNNING AWAY.

118
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:25,792
WELL, IT CAN'T BE GOOD TO BE
LOSIN' EXPLOSIVES, EDGAR.

119
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,427
OH, THAT'S FOR SURE,

120
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,095
BUT I ALWAYS LOSE 'EM.

121
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:32,231
THE BUNCH OF US WERE HAVING
A CAMPFIRE COOKOUT
THE OTHER NIGHT,

122
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,801
AND, YOU KNOW,
IN THE DARK,

123
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,704
STICKS OF DYNAMITE
LOOK A LOT LIKE KINDLING.

124
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,942
THAT MUST'VE BEEN
QUITE A CAMPFIRE.

125
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,445
OH, THE DYNAMITE GOT
IT GOIN' PRETTY FAST.

126
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:49,515
BUT IT BLEW ALL OUR
WEENIES OUT INTO THE LAKE.

127
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:56,189
I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT
ELECTRONICS, EDGAR.

128
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:59,158
WELL, IT'S PROBABLY
JUST AN ADJUSTMENT.

129
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,194
YOU SEE, WHEN YOU
PUSH THIS BUTTON HERE,

130
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:04,997
THIS UNIT SENDS OUT A
WEAK ELECTRICAL SIGNAL
UH-HUH.

131
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,734
THAT THE EXPLOSIVE
REACTS TO.

132
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,602
THEN THE MACHINE
CAN SENSE THAT

133
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,204
AND FIND IT FOR YOU.

134
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,806
WELL, THERE'S A THING HERE,
IT'S AT ONE AND A HALF,

135
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,575
AND THE DIAL GOES
ALL THE WAY TO TEN.

136
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,076
HOW HIGH DO YOU
WANT ME TO SET THAT?

137
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,378
ELEVEN.

138
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,179
ALL RIGHT.

139
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,849
OKAY, THERE YOU GO.
YOU WANNA GIVE 'ER A TRY?

140
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,685
WELL, LET ME JUST AIM
HER DOWN TOWARD
THE BOATHOUSE.

141
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,521
I THINK I MIGHT'VE
DROPPED A FEW CHARGES

142
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,556
WHEN I FELL
OFF THE ROOF.

143
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:34,093
BUT THIS'LL HELP
ME FIND 'EM.
ALL RIGHT.

144
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,062
OKAY, HERE GOES
NOTHIN'.

145
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,137
I FOUND 'EM.

146
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,506
THANKS, RED.

147
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,108
[applause]

148
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,043
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
HAULING THIS GARBAGE CAN

149
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,345
IN AND OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY

150
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:55,281
EVERY WEEK FOR
THE LAST 30 YEARS.

151
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,916
AND I'VE ALWAYS
HAD TO DO IT MYSELF

152
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:59,285
BECAUSE CRUEL FATE HAS
DENIED US THE BLESSING

153
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,354
OF HAVING A TEENAGER
AROUND THE HOUSE.

154
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,523
I'M THINKING TO MYSELF,

155
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:04,957
YOU KNOW, THERE HAS
TO BE A BETTER WAY,

156
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:08,461
A WAY OF REPLACING WASTED ENERGY
WITH INNOVATION AND ENGINEERING.

157
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:09,862
AND THEN IT CAME TO ME.

158
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:14,000
HOW ABOUT A MECHANICAL HOIST
COMING OFF THE POSSUM VAN

159
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,701
THAT WOULD DO THE WORK FOR ME?

160
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,603
IF THOSE SCIENTIST GUYS
CAN MAKE A CANADARM,

161
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,373
WHY CAN'T I MAKE A
GARBAGE CANADARM?

162
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,375
HERE'S WHAT I
FIGURE YOU NEED...

163
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,377
SOME P.V.C. PIPE,

164
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,679
COUPLE OF 45-DEGREE ELBOWS,

165
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,347
HEAVY DUTY FISHING ROD,

166
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,249
COUPLE OF DESK LAMPS,
COUPLE OF COAT HOOKS,

167
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:31,651
AND A TRUMPET.

168
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:34,487
OKAY, SO FIRST THING YOU WANNA
DO IS CUT THE P.V.C. PIPE

169
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,923
SO YOU GET AN ARM COMING OFF
THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOF
OF THE VAN,

170
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,025
SWINGING OUT OVER THE SIDE.

171
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:40,593
AND THEN YOU GLUE THE WHOLE
SCHAMOZZLE TOGETHER

172
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,162
WITH THIS SPECIAL
P.V.C. CEMENT.

173
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,168
EIGHT MILES HIGH -- 

174
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,339
YOU REALLY WANNA HAVE
PROPER VENTILATION

175
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,408
WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH
THE PLASTIC CEMENT.

176
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,544
I COULD'VE LOST A FEW BRAIN
CELLS THERE, I TELL YOU.

177
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,279
WHAT YEAR IS THIS?

178
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,882
OH, WELL.
ANYWAY, WE GOT THE ARM PART.

179
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:04,817
NOW WE NEED TO ADD THE
ENGINEERING TO IT.

180
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,519
SO WHAT YOU WANNA
DO FIRST OF ALL IS

181
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:09,489
DUCT TAPE THE COAT HOOKS TO THE
ENDS OF THE DESK LAMPS,

182
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:10,823
LIKE I'VE DONE HERE.

183
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,925
AND THIS IS IN KEEPING WITH
NASAU'S SPECIFICATIONS.

184
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,295
THESE HOOKS ARE DESIGNED TO
ENGAGE THE HANDLES OF
THE GARBAGE CAN,

185
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,464
EVEN IN A
ZERO-GRAVITY SITUATION.

186
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,466
MIND YOU, IF WE GET
ZERO GRAVITY HERE ON EARTH,

187
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,869
I'M NOT SURE TAKING OUT THE
GARBAGE WOULD BE A TOP PRIORITY.

188
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,470
ANYWAY, THEN WHAT YOU DO IS

189
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,172
YOU DUCT TAPE THE
DESK LAMPS THEMSELVES

190
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,241
TO THE ENDS OF THE PIPE.

191
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,877
AND MAKE SURE YOU HOOK UP
THE LAMP PARTS, EH.

192
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,411
THAT WAY YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO SEE AT NIGHT

193
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,913
BECAUSE THERE'S CERTAIN
KINDS OF GARBAGE

194
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,883
YOU REALLY ONLY WANNA
TAKE OUT AFTER DARK.

195
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,119
NOW WE NEED SOMETHING THAT WILL
SEPARATE THE DESK LAMPS OUT

196
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:43,055
AND ALSO SERVE AS A GUIDE
FOR OUR FISHING LINE.

197
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,657
NOW, THAT'S WHERE
THE TRUMPET COMES IN.

198
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:45,958
WE DON'T NEED
THE WHOLE THING,

199
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,293
JUST THE LOUD PART.

200
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,000
OKAY, THERE'S OUR
GUIDE MOUNTED IN PLACE,

201
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,503
AND NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS
RUN THE FISHING LINES UP
FROM THE REEL,

202
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,172
UP THROUGH THE PIPE,
OUT THROUGH THE BELL
OF THE TRUMPET,

203
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:03,209
AND THEN HOOK ONE ONTO EACH
OF THESE DESK LAMPS.

204
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:07,647
THAT WAY, WE CAN KIND OF
CONTROL THE OPENING AND
CLOSING OF OUR CLAW.

205
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,549
NOW ALL WE GOTTA DO
IS TAKE THIS UNIT

206
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:12,218
AND MOUNT IT ONTO
THE ROOF OF THE VAN.

207
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,687
BOY, IF ONLY WE HAD SOME
KIND OF ROTATING MOUNT

208
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,223
THAT WOULD GIVE US SOME
FLEXIBILITY

209
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,559
SO THAT WE COULD SORT OF
SWING THE ARM AROUND --

210
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,127
OH, THERE WE GO.

211
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:28,200
OKAY, THERE'S OUR 360°
FLOATING MOUNT,

212
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,570
AND I'VE MOUNTED THE
FISHING REEL ONTO THERE

213
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,672
WITH THE LINES RUNNING
DOWN TO THE DESK LAMPS.

214
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,473
SO WE'RE PRETTY WELL
READY TO GO.

215
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,008
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

216
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,610
MOUNT THE UNIT
ON THERE LOOSELY

217
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,579
SO THAT YOU CAN RAISE
THE ARM UP AND DOWN

218
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,615
JUST BY LEANING
ON THE HANDLE.

219
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,722
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

220
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,857
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

221
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,527
NOW LET'S TRY OUT
OUR GARBAGE CANADARM.

222
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,028
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING
WASTED SPACE,

223
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,463
THINK OF ME.

224
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,578
I READ AN ARTICLE
IN A MAGAZINE

225
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,448
ABOUT WHAT MEN CAN EXPECT FROM
THEIR BODIES AT THE AGE OF 45.

226
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,651
APPARENTLY NOT MUCH.

227
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,587
ABOUT NOW, OUR BODIES
ARE LIKE OUR TIRES...

228
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,857
BALD, SOFT, AND LEAKY.

229
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:02,128
MOST OF US HAVE PUT ON
A FAIR AMOUNT OF WEIGHT.

230
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,330
WE'RE EVEN KIND OF A DIFFERENT
SHAPE THAN WE USED TO BE.

231
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,998
SOMETIMES YOU LOOK
AT YOUR SHADOW

232
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,367
AND YOU GOTTA MOVE SOMETHING
JUST TO MAKE SURE IT'S YOU.

233
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,771
NOW, YOU'RE GONNA BE UNDER
A LOT OF PRESSURE TO GET FIT,

234
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,472
BUT I SAY,
DON'T BE DOING THAT.

235
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,574
THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO GO
OUT FOR A TEN-MILE RUN

236
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,310
FOLLOWED BY TWO HOURS
OF WEIGHT LIFTING.

237
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,280
THAT TRAIN LEFT
MANY YEARS AGO,

238
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,749
AND, BUDDY,
YOU WEREN'T ON IT.

239
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,888
YOU WERE IN THE DEPARTURE LOUNGE
EATING FRIES AND GRAVY.

240
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:31,023
SO I SAY JUST RELAX.

241
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,725
DON'T PANIC.

242
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,593
YEAH, SURE, YOUR BODY'S
GETTIN' BIGGER

243
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,629
WHILE YOUR BRAIN'S
GETTIN' SMALLER,

244
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,799
BUT THE TWO OF THEM HAVE GOTTEN
ALONG FOR ALMOST HALF A CENTURY

245
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,668
BY NOT EXPECTING TOO
MUCH OF EACH OTHER.

246
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,571
DON'T WRECK IT.

247
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,440
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

248
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,175
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

249
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:57,149
NOW, MEN, I DON'T EVEN
WANNA WASTE YOUR TIME
WITH THIS ONE,

250
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,118
BUT YOU'RE LODGE MEMBERS,

251
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,720
AND UNFORTUNATELY,
IT'S A DEMOCRACY,

252
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,555
SO YOU GET TO
VOTE ON THIS,

253
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,157
EVEN THOUGH WE ALL KNOW
THIS ONE'S GOING
DOWN THE DUMPER.

254
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,860
IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF
HOW HARD IT'S GONNA HIT.

255
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:09,662
HAROLD.

256
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,968
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR THAT IMPARTIAL
INTRODUCTION, UNCLE RED.

257
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,837
WELL, MAYBE YOU'VE HEARD,

258
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:21,640
BUT MULTI-CORP HAS MADE A VERY
GENEROUS OFFER TO PURCHASE
POSSUM LODGE

259
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,210
AND ALL ITS BUILDINGS
AND PROPERTIES.

260
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:28,647
IT'S A CASH OFFER WITH ONLY
A COUPLE CONDITIONS...

261
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,750
THE DEAL'S SET TO CLOSE IN,
LIKE, 30 DAYS, RIGHT;

262
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:34,520
AND EVEN AFTER ALL THE BACK
TAXES, ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS
HAVE BEEN PAID,

263
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,455
EACH LODGE MEMBER
CAN WALK AWAY WITH

264
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:39,425
OVER $25,000!

265
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,828
ALL IN FAVOUR.

266
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,463
WAIT. WAIT. WAIT.

267
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,731
PUT THE HANDS DOWN.
PUT 'EM DOWN.

268
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,266
PUT THE HANDS DOWN.
PUT 'EM DOWN.

269
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,601
I'M THE LODGE
LEADER, HAROLD.

270
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:49,869
I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO
CAN CALL FOR A VOTE.

271
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,670
I'M SORRY.
YES, YOU'RE
ABSOLUTELY --

272
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:54,073
HE'S RIGHT.
OKAY, YOU GO AHEAD
AND CALL FOR THE VOTE.

273
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,574
I WILL.

274
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,276
IN A MINUTE.
IN A MINUTE.

275
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,111
PUT 'EM DOWN.

276
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,413
WHY DON'T YOU TELL 'EM ABOUT
THOSE CONDITIONS FIRST?

277
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,848
OH, OKAY, WELL,

278
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,750
THE DEAL CAN'T CLOSE
UNTIL THAT TIRE FIRE
IS PUT OUT

279
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,219
IN THE NORTH END
OF THE PROPERTY.

280
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,321
THAT THING'S BEEN
BURNIN' SINCE, LIKE --

281
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,457
I DUNNO WHEN.

282
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,660
THAT'S A LANDMARK,
HAROLD.

283
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,963
ARE YOU ASKING US TO TURN
OUR BACKS ON OUR HERITAGE?

284
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,933
WELL, IF YOUR HERITAGE IS
BLACK SMOKE AND TOXIC FUMES,

285
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,701
YES.

286
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:24,670
ALL RIGHT.
TELL 'EM ABOUT
THE OTHER CONDITION.

287
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:25,938
TELL 'EM.

288
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,506
WELL, THIS ONE'S
KINDA OBVIOUS,

289
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,074
BUT SINCE
MULTI-CORP IS ACTUALLY
PURCHASING THE LAND

290
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,376
AND DOING ALL
THE RENOVATIONS,

291
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:31,944
THEY'RE GOING TO TURN
THIS PLACE INTO A RETREAT

292
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,246
FOR THEIR CORPORATE
EXECUTIVES FROM ALL
OVER THE WORLD.

293
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,849
SO IT WON'T BE
OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.

294
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,219
YEAH, BUT THE PUBLIC
NEVER COMES HERE ANYWAY.

295
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,188
YEAH, BUT THAT'S BECAUSE
IT DOESN'T WANT TO,

296
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,423
NOT BECAUSE IT CAN'T.

297
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,692
LET'S GET IT ALL
OUT HERE, HAROLD, EH.

298
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:49,428
WILL ANY OF US BE ABLE TO
GO TO THIS FANCY NEW PLACE?

299
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,797
HA! NO!

300
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,365
WELL, NO, I SHOULDN'T
SAY THAT.

301
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,467
UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU'RE
HIRED TO BE AN EXECUTIVE
AT MULTI-CORP,

302
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,971
AND I'M TAKIN' A GUESS HERE
THAT THAT'S A LONG SHOT.

303
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,273
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
SO THERE YOU HAVE IT.

304
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,175
THEY WANNA TAKE
OVER THE LODGE,

305
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,611
YUPPIE IT UP LIKE
THERE'S NO TOMORROW,

306
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,314
ERASE EVERYTHING
WE'VE EVER DONE HERE,

307
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,748
AND ON TOP OF THAT,

308
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,717
THEY EXPECT US TO PUT
OUT THE TIRE FIRE

309
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,986
WHEN WE'RE BARELY HALFWAY
THROUGH THE PILE.

310
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:14,520
BOO.

311
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:15,487
BOO.
BOO.

312
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,357
ABSOLUTELY.
I MEAN, WHO CAN BELIEVE IT?

313
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:21,160
AND ALL THIS FOR A
LOUSY 25 GRAND A PIECE.

314
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,262
I MEAN, IS ANYBODY
IN FAVOUR?

315
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,039
OH, OH, RED GREEN.

316
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,641
PERFECT TIMING.

317
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,776
I'M JUST ABOUT TO SHOW
MY NEW EDUCATIONAL FILM.

318
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,612
THAT'S THE KIND OF
DAY I'VE BEEN HAVING.

319
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,048
HEY, I HOPE THESE FILMS ARE
HELPING OUT WITH YOUR SHOW.

320
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:46,051
I HEAR THEY'RE VERY POPULAR
WITH PEOPLE WHO DON'T
WATCH TELEVISION.

321
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,921
YEAH, I SUPPOSE
THAT'S TRUE.

322
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,289
WHY DON'T YOU GET A
PROFESSIONAL ANIMATOR, GORD?

323
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:53,626
YOU KNOW, EVEN A CLEVER
SIX-YEAR-OLD WOULD HELP
ON THESE THINGS.

324
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:54,760
OH, NO.

325
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:56,562
NO, NO, IT'S MUCH BETTER
IF I DO ALL THE DRAWINGS,

326
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:57,796
ALL THE VOICES.

327
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,832
ONE VOICE,
ONE VISION.
ONE BRAIN CELL.

328
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:03,202
THIS PARTICULAR ONE IS
ALL ABOUT TREE SPECIES,

329
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,503
TYPES OF TREES.

330
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:05,804
YOU KNOW THE OLD EXPRESSION,

331
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,539
YOU CAN'T SEE THE FOREST
FOR THE TYPES OF TREES.

332
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,841
THAT'S NOT QUITE RIGHT,
YOU KNOW?

333
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,509
DOESN'T MATTER.
OH.

334
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,911
ACORN?

335
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,245
UH, NOT RIGHT NOW,

336
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,347
BUT MAYBE I'LL STUFF
MY CHEEKS BEFORE I GO.

337
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,249
SUIT YOURSELF.

338
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,484
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

339
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,685
SHH!

340
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,590
[quirky upbeat music]

341
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,077
HI, EVERYONE.

342
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,046
TAPPING TREES
TAKES A LOT OF PATIENCE

343
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,347
AND TALENT.

344
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,352
THAT IS
CORRECT, RED.

345
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,788
A TELEPHONE POLE IS
STILL A TREE, YOU KNOW?

346
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,590
JUST BECAUSE IT HAS NO LEAVES OR
BARK AND GROWS NEXT TO A ROAD

347
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,492
DOESN'T MEAN IT
ISN'T A TREE.

348
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,761
WOW, REALLY?

349
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,332
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT TELEPHONE
POLES WERE A SPECIES OF TREE.

350
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,600
WELL, THEY AREN'T, HAROLD,

351
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:12,671
AND TELEPHONE POLES
DO NOT GROW NEXT TO ROADS.

352
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:16,542
WELL, NOT UNTIL YOU PLANT
THEM THERE THEY DON'T.

353
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,610
DIG A HOLE, RED.

354
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,781
HAROLD, I WANT YOU
TO PLANT THIS CELL PHONE.

355
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,097
NOW, BOYS,

356
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,132
LET US CELEBRATE THE
BIRTH OF THIS NEW TREE

357
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,667
WITH A DRINK!

358
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,807
AH, YUCKY.

359
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:51,176
YUCK, THIS ISN'T
MAPLE SAP.

360
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,878
OF COURSE NOT.

361
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,547
MAPLE SAP COMES
FROM A MAPLE TREE.

362
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,383
OH, GORD, WHAT KIND
OF LIQUID

363
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,885
COMES OUT OF A
TELEPHONE POLE?

364
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,054
NITRO GLYCERINE.

365
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,890
NITRO GLYCERINE?
NITRO GLYCERINE!

366
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,925
YEP.
OH, YEAH.

367
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:09,028
YOU LEARN SOMETHING
NEW EVERY DAY.

368
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,335
UNTIL YOU DRINK
NITRO GLYCERINE, THAT IS.

369
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,170
HA HA HA HA.

370
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,311
[applause]

371
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,358
OH, HEY.

372
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,897
OH, RIGHT, UH, WELCOME
TO MIKE'S TEEN TALK.

373
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:52,004
A LOT OF YOU TEENS ARE TRYING
TO GET A TOUGH REPUTATION
FOR YOURSELVES

374
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:54,106
BY PACKING WEAPONS, RIGHT,

375
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,741
EVEN IF YOU CAN ONLY
AFFORD A DILL PICKLE

376
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,610
THAT'S SHARPENED AT ONE END
AND WRAPPED IN TINFOIL.

377
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:01,213
WELL, I GOT A TIP
FOR YOU GUYS

378
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,982
ABOUT THE MOST SOPHISTICATED
WEAPON YOU CAN PACK,

379
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,318
AND IT WON'T EVEN
COST YOU A CENT.

380
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:09,822
I'M TALKING ABOUT STUPIDITY.

381
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:11,924
PEOPLE THINK
YOU'RE AN IDIOT,

382
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,726
YOUR LIFE GETS
A WHOLE LOT SIMPLER.

383
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,463
THE TEACHERS DON'T PAY
ANY ATTENTION TO YOU.

384
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,631
NOBODY BORROWS YOUR NOTES.

385
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,967
EVEN YOUR PARENTS WILL
BACK OFF A LITTLE, RIGHT.

386
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,735
BUT, I MEAN,
IF YOU'RE A BRAINER,

387
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,604
YOU GOT NO LIFE AT ALL.

388
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,906
THEY WANT YOU TO ANSWER
ALL THEIR QUESTIONS,

389
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,142
AND THEY WANT
YOU CURE DISEASES,

390
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,044
AND THEY WANT YOU
TO INVENT STUFF,

391
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,346
LIKE THE WEIGHTLESS POTATO.

392
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:38,283
YOU'RE WAY BETTER OFF WITH
A ROOM TEMPERATURE I.Q.

393
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,385
ESPECIALLY WHEN SOMETHING GOES
WRONG AND SOMEONE SHOUTS,

394
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,322
ALL RIGHT,
WHO'S THE SMART GUY?

395
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,724
YOU DON'T WANT 'EM
POINTING AT YOU, RIGHT?

396
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,427
I MEAN, EVEN IN PRISON --
EVEN IN PRISON,

397
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,796
THEY KEEP THE SMART
ONES IN WAY LONGER.

398
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,698
THEY LET THE DUMB
ONES OUT EARLIER

399
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,099
BECAUSE THEY'RE
JUST IDIOTS, RIGHT,

400
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,035
AND THEY'LL HAVE NO TROUBLE
FITTING BACK INTO SOCIETY.

401
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,304
SO STAY STUPID.

402
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,939
YOU'LL GET A LOT MORE PRIVACY,

403
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,774
YOU'LL GET
REALLY EASY JOBS,

404
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:06,078
AND NOBODY'LL MIND IF
YOU WATCH JERRY SPRINGER.

405
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,679
OH, THAT'S IT.

406
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,414
[applause]

407
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:13,085
OH, MAN.

408
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:16,355
WELL,
THE FIRE'S OUT.

409
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:19,925
PUT A LOT OF WATER
ON 'ER, I'LL TELL YOU.

410
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,161
MORE THAN WE
NEEDED, I'D SAY.

411
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,862
WELL, YOU KNOW ME.

412
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:26,398
I'D RATHER ERR ON
THE SIDE OF SAFETY.

413
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,800
WHERE'D YOU GET
THE FIRE BOMBERS?

414
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,469
OH, THAT WAS A
BRAINWAVE, EH?

415
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,737
I CALLED UP
THE AIR RESCUE.

416
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,038
I TOLD 'EM WE
HAD A TIRE FIRE

417
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,907
COMPLETELY
OUT OF CONTROL.

418
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,476
THEY SURE RESPONDED
WITH A LOT OF FIRE POWER.

419
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:41,280
YEAH, WELL, I MAY HAVE
MENTIONED SOMETHING
ABOUT P.C.B.s

420
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,981
BUT, HEY,
THE FIRE'S OUT.

421
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,349
THAT'S THE
MAIN THING.

422
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,151
OH, NO!
OH, NO, NO, NO!

423
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,319
THAT'S NOT
THE MAIN THING.

424
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:48,754
NO, THE MAIN THING IS
THAT ALL THAT WATER

425
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,389
COULDN'T RACE BACK
INTO THE LAKE.

426
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:53,525
SOMEBODY DROPPED A CORD OF
WOOD IN THE RUN-OFF DITCH.

427
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,861
SON OF A GUN!

428
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,430
YEAH, WELL, IT JUST
RACED DOWN TO THE LODGE

429
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,532
AND FLOODED THE
MAIN DINING ROOM.

430
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,501
YEAH, AND THEN BECAUSE
IT WAS POSSUM LAKE WATER,

431
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,970
IT DISSOLVED ALL
THE MAIN SUPPORT BEAMS.

432
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:08,507
THAT BUILDING WENT DOWN
LIKE MOOSE THOMPSON
ON ROLLER SKATES.

433
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:10,709
IT'S A SHAME TOO.

434
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,211
'CAUSE THAT BUILDING
WAS PERFECT FOR SEMINARS.

435
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:15,514
IT'S ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS
THAT MULTI-CORP WANTED
TO BUY THE LODGE.

436
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,516
YEAH, I'M REALLY
UPSET ABOUT IT.

437
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,085
YEAH, WELL, NOW THE
DEAL'S OFF.

438
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,221
IT'S A SETBACK,
HAROLD.

439
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,956
DON'T SAY THAT.
YOU'RE HAPPY ABOUT IT.

440
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:25,357
I'M NOT HAPPY,

441
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,426
I JUST ADAPT
WELL TO LIFE.

442
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,094
DON'T GIVE ME THAT.

443
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,896
YOU DIDN'T EVEN
WANNA SELL THE LODGE.

444
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,297
I KNOW WHERE YOU'RE
GOING WITH THIS,

445
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,933
BUT I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH FLOODING THAT
BUILDING.

446
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,436
I KNOW.
I DID.

447
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,339
YEAH.
YOU DID?

448
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,874
YEAH, 'CAUSE I KNOW THERE'S
GOING TO BE A MULTI-CORP
AROUND EVERY CORNER.

449
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:46,211
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SELL THIS
LODGE WHENEVER YOU WANT.

450
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:49,248
HOLY COW, YOU REALLY
ARE MY NEPHEW.

451
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,217
AND YOU KNOW, HAROLD,
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

452
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,353
IF I DIDN'T HAVE
THE LODGE, I'D GET BORED.

453
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,922
I'D END UP COMING DOWN TO
THE CITY AND HANGING
OUT WITH YOU.

454
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,690
YEAH, I KNOW.

455
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,727
THAT'S WHY I DID IT.
