1
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:05,939
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

2
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:08,908
WHAT'S RED AND GREEN
AND PLAID ALL OVER?

3
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:10,477
I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT.

4
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:12,879
YOUR!

5
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,280
WHOO!

6
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,883
(Applause and cheering)

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,384
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

8
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,053
BY GOLLY -- OK, BEAUTIFUL.

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,688
THIS IS A BIG DAY,

10
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,556
PROBABLY MY FAVOURITE DAY,

11
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:24,924
NEXT TO CHRISTMAS

12
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:26,426
AND PANCAKE TUESDAY.

13
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:27,794
IT'S THE BEST DAY,

14
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,329
THE MOST FANTASTIC DAY.

15
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:30,930
IT'S NOT JUST THE GIFTS.

16
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:33,233
IT'S PEOPLE'S THOUGHTFULNESS,

17
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,135
THE APPRECIATION OF PEOPLE.

18
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,769
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

19
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:40,840
THE BALLOONS AND THE FANCY CAKE
DON'T HURT AT ALL, EITHER.

20
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:44,811
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT
THE SAME SPECIAL DAY, HAROLD.

21
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,647
WHAT SPECIAL DAY
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

22
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:48,982
ASPHALT DAY.

23
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:52,252
NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT
AUNT BERNICE'S BIRTHDAY.

24
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:53,586
WHAT?

25
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:54,921
AUNT BERNICE.

26
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:57,090
BERNICE? MY WIFE?

27
00:00:57,156 --> 00:00:58,725
BINGO!

28
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:00,660
WHAT DID
YOU GET HER?

29
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:04,831
(Laughing)

30
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:09,836
(Horns honking)

31
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,438
(Geese honking)

32
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,942
(Quacking)

33
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:21,381
(Red): YOU'RE LOOKIN'
AT SEGMENTS

34
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:23,182
FROM THIS PARTICULAR SHOW,

35
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,550
THE MAIN MESSAGE BEING,

36
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:27,186
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT CHANGING THE CHANNEL.

37
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,856
TO MAKE SENSE
OUT OF THIS PROGRAMME,

38
00:01:29,922 --> 00:01:31,190
YOU GOTTA GIVE IT

39
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,459
YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.

40
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:46,673
MAN! IT REALLY IS
BERNICE'S BIRTHDAY.

41
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,374
HER BIRTHDAY FALLS A WEEK
THAT'S HOW I REMEMBER IT.

42
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,842
WHAT IS ASPHALT DAY?

43
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:51,344
ASPHALT DAY,
HAROLD.

44
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,845
YOU KNOW,
ASPHALT DAY.

45
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:54,947
EVERY SPRING, THE HIGHWAY CREWS

46
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:57,650
FIX THE CRACKS
AND POT-HOLES IN THE ROAD.

47
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:01,654
THEY HEAD TO THE MAIN HIGHWAY,
BUT BEFORE THE ASPHALT COOLS,

48
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:05,324
WE DRIVE THROUGH THE HOLES,
UNDERCOAT ALL OUR VEHICLES.

49
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,627
THEN WE SCOOP UP
THE LOOSE ASPHALT,

50
00:02:07,693 --> 00:02:10,229
TAKE IT HOME, AND
FIX OUR OWN DRIVEWAYS.

51
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,564
(Audience laughing)

52
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,900
WOW... UM...

53
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:17,069
I COULD SEE WHY
THAT'S EXCITING, IN YOUR MIND,

54
00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:20,473
BUT I'M THINKING, YOU KNYOY,

55
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,176
MAYBE IT'S JUST SLIGHTLY
MORE IMPORTANT

56
00:02:23,242 --> 00:02:25,378
E E BUCKET OF PAVEMENT.

57
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:28,848
I KNOW, HAROLD, BUT ALL
THE STORES WILL BE CLOSED.

58
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,483
IT'S NOT EVEN NOON YET.

59
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,351
IT'S ASPHALT DAY --
NOTHING'S OPEN.

60
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:33,686
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.

61
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:35,755
PORT ASBESTOS --
I'LL GO UP THERE.

62
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,257
IT'S NOT ASPHALT DAY THERE
TILL TOMORROW.

63
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,859
THAT'S 125 MILES AWAY.

64
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:43,496
BY THE TIME YOU ARRIVE,
EVERYTHING
 WILL
 BE CLOSED.

65
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,731
THEY'RE MORE COSMOPOLITAN
UP THERE.

66
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,633
THE GAS STATION'S OPEN
TILL 7:00.

67
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,202
(Audience laughing)

68
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:52,305
(Red): IN THE "ADVENTURES
WITH BILL" SEGMENT,

69
00:02:52,371 --> 00:02:54,540
WE'RE GONNA BE
COOKING SOME HOT--

70
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:57,109
WELL, WE'RE STARTING
TO COOK THEM NOW,

71
00:02:57,176 --> 00:03:00,980
BUT, YOU KNOW, BY GOLLY, JUST
TAKES YOU BACK, DOESN'T IT?

72
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,949
AND MY LUCKY CAMPING JACKET,

73
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:05,551
WHEN I WAS A KID --
I DON'T KNOW WHY BILL

74
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:08,588
FELT HE HAD TO WAVE
WITH HIS WIENIE BUT...

75
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:18,464
EVE WHEN YOUSTSTERSCK
WOULD BE MAYBE 9, 10...

76
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,267
SOME OF US WERE 17,
D DIDN'T MATTER.

77
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,069
WE WERE IN THEE E GRADE.

78
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:24,537
WE'D BE SITTING AROUND,

79
00:03:24,603 --> 00:03:27,039
AND GET DOWN BY THE CAMP-FIRE
AND JUST...

80
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,308
WE WOULD USE THE STICKS,
YOU KNOW --

81
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,744
STICKS ON THE HOT DOGS,
AND EVERYTHING,

82
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,080
BUT BY GOLLY,
IT'S JUST KINDA NICE...

83
00:03:34,146 --> 00:03:36,782
BILL SEEMS TO CARRY HOT DOGS
IN HIS POCKET.

84
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:39,885
I DON'T KNOW -- I GUESS
HE'S USING IT AS GRATUITIES

85
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:41,387
AT THE VARIOUS HOTELS

86
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:42,988
HE STAYS AT, I SUPPOSE.

87
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:44,657
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, BILL?

88
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,425
HE NEEDS THE COAT HANGER.

89
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:47,927
WHOA!

90
00:03:47,993 --> 00:03:49,528
UH-OH!

91
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:51,197
OHHHH

92
00:03:51,263 --> 00:03:54,533
DON'T EVER GET
A SNAKE BITE

93
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,870
DON'T EVER DARE ONE
TO STRIKE

94
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,873
DON'T TAKE A SNAKE AND
WRAP IT AROUND YOUR HEAD

95
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,209
ESPECIALLY WHEN
YOU'RE RIDING YOUR BIKE

96
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:05,544
ON THE HIGHWAY

97
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:08,581
OHH, DON'T EVER GET
A SNAKE BITE

98
00:04:08,647 --> 00:04:12,051
'CAUSE, BELIEVE ME,
THAT HURTS PLENTY

99
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:15,221
AND DON'T DROP A RATTLER
INTO YOUR SHORTS

100
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:18,958
BUT THEN, HINDSIGHT IS
ALWAYS 20-20

101
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,762
OH, YEAH.

102
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:25,564
THIS IS FOR THE GRAND PRIZE

103
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:27,633
URURE SOUNDS,

104
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,636
RECORDED AT POSSUM LODGE,
WHEN STINKY PETERSON

105
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:33,572
ACCIDENTALLY HIT
THE RECORD BUTTON ON A DATE.

106
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,907
YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS

107
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:37,743
TO MAKE MR. HAP SHAUGHNESSY
SAY THIS WORD...

108
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,578
"ALIEN".

109
00:04:39,645 --> 00:04:42,081
NA-NA-NA-NA!

110
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:44,016
OK, GO.

111
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,085
ALL RIGHT,
IN THE MOVIE "E.T.",

112
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:48,621
E.T. WAS...
... MY IDEA.

113
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:50,923
(Audience laughing)

114
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,261
OF COURSE, SPIELBERG NEVER
GAVE ME ANY CREDIT... AGAIN.

115
00:04:55,327 --> 00:04:56,662
YEAH, OK,
OK, FINE.

116
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:57,997
ALL RIGH

117
00:04:58,063 --> 00:05:00,266
SAY ANXTXTRATERRESTRIAL
IN A SPACESHIP--

118
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,503
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT
THAT INCIDENT., NO.

119
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,339
NATIONAL SECURITY.

120
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:09,608
NO, HAP, A CREATURE
FROM ANOTHER PLANET.

121
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:11,977
VOLDAR.

122
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:13,312
PARDON ME?

123
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,547
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID
HIS NAME WAS.

124
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:17,049
I CAN'T DIVULGE MORE.

125
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:20,419
NO, HAP, I'M TALKING ABOUT
LITTLE GREEN MEN FROM MARS.

126
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,754
THAT'S A...

127
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,222
... A MYTH -- THEY'RE BLUE.

128
00:05:23,288 --> 00:05:24,556
OH...

129
00:05:24,623 --> 00:05:25,891
OH, BOY.

130
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,726
I MAY HAVE SAID TOO MUCH.

131
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:29,528
WELL, WE'RE
USED TO THAT.

132
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,530
I BETTER GET OUT OF HERE.

133
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:32,865
NATIONAL SECURITY.

134
00:05:32,931 --> 00:05:35,100
"X-FILES" AND ALL THAT,
YOU KNOW.

135
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,537
THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE.

136
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,039
WAY OUT THERE.

137
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:41,840
(Laughing)

138
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:43,842
THIS WEEK ON "HANDYMAN CORNER",

139
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:46,745
THOUGHT I'D GIVE
THE POSSUM VAN A PAINT JOB.

140
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:49,314
YOU'RE PROBABLY ASKING,
"HOW COME, RED?

141
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:50,716
"SHE LOOKS OK TO ME."

142
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:53,886
OR "DON'T YOU NEED
ONE OF THEM AIR COMPRESSORS?"

143
00:05:53,952 --> 00:05:55,988
OR "WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS SHOW?"

144
00:05:56,054 --> 00:05:58,190
LET ME ANSWER THAT
BY TELLING YOU,

145
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:01,627
NO, SIR, I DON'T NEED
ONE OF THEM AIR COMPRESSORS...

146
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:05,964
NOT WH G GOT 60 POUNDS
PER SQUARE INCH IN EACTITIRE.

147
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:07,432
GET YOURSELF A FUNNEL.

148
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:09,401
PUT YOUR FINGER OVER THE END.

149
00:06:09,468 --> 00:06:12,037
PUT PAINT IN 'ER,
AND THEN WHAT YOU DO IS

150
00:06:12,104 --> 00:06:13,372
YOU USE THE FUNNEL

151
00:06:13,438 --> 00:06:15,541
TO PUT THE PAINT INTO THE TIRE.

152
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:21,380
OK, APPARENTLY THE AIR
DOES GET IN THE WAY OF THAT.

153
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:24,750
I'VE FLATTENED ALL FOUR TIRES.

154
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:26,785
FOR ONCE, I DID IT ON PURPOSE.

155
00:06:26,852 --> 00:06:30,789
I NEEDED ALL FOUR BECAUSE I GOT
FOUR DIFFERENT KINDS OF PAINT.

156
00:06:30,856 --> 00:06:32,758
I HAVE GREY AND BLACK
AND BLUE

157
00:06:32,824 --> 00:06:35,394
AND THE LITTLE WHITE HIGHLIGHTS
ON HERE.

158
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,496
OUT OF MY FOUR TIRES,
LET'S SEE.

159
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:41,533
ONE IS OLD, ONE IS NEW,
ONE IS BORROWED...

160
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,269
SO THIS ONE, I'LL MAKE BLUE.

161
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:47,639
ALL RIGHT, I GOT PAINT
IN ALL FOUR TIRES.

162
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:51,510
NOW ALL'S I HAVE TO DO
IS JUST... PUMP 'EM UP.

163
00:06:56,148 --> 00:07:01,153
(Grunting)

164
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:08,727
ALL RIGHT, NOW, YOU...
WANT TO MAKE SURE

165
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:11,463
YOU'RE IN PRETTY DECENT
PHYSICAL CONDITION

166
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,132
BEFORE YOU... PUMP UP
FOUR TIRES LIKE THAT.

167
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,601
JUST BECAUSE YOU SEE...
YOU SEE ME DO IT

168
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:18,303
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S SOMETHING

169
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,806
YOU SHOULD JUST
AUTOMATICALLY JUMP INTO.

170
00:07:20,872 --> 00:07:23,308
I GOT THE PAINT
IN ALL FOUR TIRES.

171
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:27,245
NOW I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THE PAINT IS WELL MIXED

172
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:29,481
ALL THE WAY THROUGH
ON THEM...

173
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:31,483
(Coughing)

174
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,520
IF YOU HAD A LEAKY VALVE,
YOU COULD PAINT THE TOWN RED.

175
00:07:35,587 --> 00:07:37,089
THAT CAME OUT WRONG.

176
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:43,195
TO GET THE PAINT ONTO THE VAN,
YOU NEED THESE AIR HOSES, HERE.

177
00:07:43,261 --> 00:07:45,697
YOU GET THEM
FROM YOUR LOCAL GAS STATION

178
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:49,367
AFTER THEY CLOSE AND MAYBE
THEY FORGOT TO BRING THEM IN.

179
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:52,270
SO I'VE GOT FOUR OF THEM,
ONE FROM EACH TIRE,

180
00:07:52,337 --> 00:07:54,806
OR, I SHOULD SAY,
ONE FROM EACH COLOUR.

181
00:07:54,873 --> 00:07:56,975
THEN, TO DISTRIBUTE
ALL THE PAINT,

182
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:58,310
I RUN 'ER THROUGH

183
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:01,379
ONE OF THESE SOFT-DRINK
DISPENSER NOZZLE UNITS.

184
00:08:01,446 --> 00:08:04,583
I'M GONNA USE MAINLY BLUE,
SO I MADE THAT "COLA".

185
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:07,652
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

186
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:09,988
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

187
00:08:10,055 --> 00:08:12,123
I GOT SOME
VAN CUSTOMIZING TO DO.

188
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:16,027
(Clicking)

189
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:19,464
OHHH!

190
00:08:19,531 --> 00:08:22,100
UH, ALL RIGHT,
I SHOULDN'T HAVE USED

191
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:24,469
THE QUICK-DRYING PAINT
ON THERE.

192
00:08:24,536 --> 00:08:26,304
I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING.

193
00:08:26,371 --> 00:08:28,540
I'LL NEVER HAVE A FLAT TIRE.

194
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,576
WAIT, NOW, WAIT, NOW.

195
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:34,546
NO, I THINK THE NOZZLE'S
JUST CLOGGED.

196
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:39,451
I'M GLAD THIS IS
A PLAID SHIRT.

197
00:08:39,517 --> 00:08:42,053
STAY TUNED -- WHATEVER THIS IS,

198
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,989
WE GOT LOTS MORE OF IT.

199
00:08:48,393 --> 00:08:49,894
WANT TO TALK TO YOU GUYS

200
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:53,031
WHO ARE THINKING
ABOUT GETTING MARRIED... AGAIN.

201
00:08:53,098 --> 00:08:54,966
BEFORE YOU MAKE THE LIFE-LONG

202
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:57,402
TILL-DEATH-DO-US-PART
COMMITMENT THING

203
00:08:57,469 --> 00:08:59,337
FOR THE SECOND OR THIRD TIME,

204
00:08:59,404 --> 00:09:01,873
CAN I JUST ASK YOU
ONE SIMPLE QUESTION?

205
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,274
WHAT ARE YOU, NUTS?

206
00:09:03,341 --> 00:09:06,311
WHY WOULD YOU GIVE UP THE ONE
THING THAT ALL MEN WANT?

207
00:09:06,378 --> 00:09:07,679
FREEDOM.

208
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:11,349
I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT
FREEDOM TO DRIVE ANYWHERE.

209
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:14,319
I'M TALKING ABOUT FREEDOM
TO DRIVE ANYWHERE...

210
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:15,820
THE WAY YOU WANT.

211
00:09:15,887 --> 00:09:17,322
(Audience laughing)

212
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:20,458
FREEDOM TO STOP AT THE BATHROOM
WHEN
 YOU
 WANT TO.

213
00:09:20,525 --> 00:09:23,795
FREEDOM TO GO TO THE
DRIVE-THROUGH WHEN YOU WANT TO.

214
00:09:23,862 --> 00:09:27,232
THE FREEDOM TO BE ABLE
TO HOLD ON TO YOUR LOW-BROWED,

215
00:09:27,298 --> 00:09:29,601
NARROW-MINDED,
SHORT-SIGHTED OPINIONS

216
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:31,836
WITHOUT EVER HAVING
TO DEFEND THEM.

217
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,271
(Audience laughing)

218
00:09:33,338 --> 00:09:35,840
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO GIVE THAT UP?

219
00:09:35,907 --> 00:09:37,575
BECAUSE YOU'LL HAVE TO.

220
00:09:37,642 --> 00:09:39,344
OH, YEAH, OH, FOR SURE.

221
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:40,678
OH, YEAH.

222
00:09:40,745 --> 00:09:44,149
SHE'S MARRYING YOU
FOR THE EXACT OPPOSITE REASON

223
00:09:44,215 --> 00:09:45,984
THAT YOU'RE MARRYING HER.

224
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,852
SHE THINKS YOU'LL CHANGE.

225
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,354
(Laughing)

226
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,625
SHE THINKS YOU'LL CHANGE
FOR THE BETTER...

227
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:55,860
... IMPROVE WITH AGE.

228
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:58,396
HEY, THINGS DON'T IMPROVE
WITH AGE.

229
00:09:58,463 --> 00:09:59,864
LOOK AT YOUR TRUCK!

230
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:01,366
(Laughing)

231
00:10:01,432 --> 00:10:03,535
LOOK AT YOUR ROOF!

232
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:05,870
LOOK IN THE MIRROR!

233
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:08,406
SO FOR GOSH SAKE,
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE,

234
00:10:08,473 --> 00:10:10,041
DON'T GET MARRIED AGAIN!

235
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:11,543
AND DON'T FEEL GUILTY.

236
00:10:11,609 --> 00:10:14,312
I'M SURE SOMEONE ON
HER SIDE OF THE FAMILY

237
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:16,347
IS GIVING HER THE SAME ADVICE.

238
00:10:16,414 --> 00:10:18,716
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

239
00:10:18,783 --> 00:10:20,885
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

240
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:23,688
(Laughing and applause)

241
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:25,323
EVER GET THE FEELING

242
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,327
THAT CRUEL FATE IS
PLAYING YOU OUT LIKE A BASS?

243
00:10:29,394 --> 00:10:31,262
WOULD THAT BE

244
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:32,830
A LARGE-MOUTH?

245
00:10:32,897 --> 00:10:35,133
(Laughing)

246
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:37,602
WOULD THAT BE
A SUICIDE ATTEMPT?

247
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:39,604
(Audience laughing)

248
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:42,507
I'M HEADING OUT TO THE HIGHWAY
IN THE VAN.

249
00:10:42,573 --> 00:10:44,709
SOME MORON TOOK ALL THE ASPHALT

250
00:10:44,776 --> 00:10:47,845
OUT OF THE BIG POT-HOLE
BY PIE PEAK TURN-OFF.

251
00:10:47,912 --> 00:10:49,347
MAN, I NAILED 'ER.

252
00:10:49,414 --> 00:10:51,883
BENT A STRUT, BROKE A TIE ROD,

253
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:55,353
TOOK A GOOD SHOT
IN ONE OF MY BALL JOINTS.

254
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,123
I DIDN'T GET TO PORT ASBESTOS
AND COULDN'T GET BERNICE

255
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,592
A BIRTHDAY GIFT
AT THE GAS STATION.

256
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:03,094
A VERY NOVEL CONCEPT.

257
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:05,396
INTERESTING SHOPPING VENUE,
UNCLE RED --

258
00:11:05,463 --> 00:11:06,764
A GAS STATION.

259
00:11:06,831 --> 00:11:10,501
YOU KNOW, I GUESS YOU'RE AFTER
THAT HIGH-END STUFF --

260
00:11:10,568 --> 00:11:14,839
THE FUZZY DICE, THE ROAD MAPS,
KEY CHAINS, THINGS LIKE THAT.

261
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:16,841
I WAS GETTING HER GLASSWARE.

262
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:18,910
IT'S FREE WITH A FILL-UP, OK?

263
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:20,712
THERE'S 12-OUNCE GLASSES.

264
00:11:20,778 --> 00:11:22,380
THEY'RE UNBREAKABLE, AND

265
00:11:22,447 --> 00:11:24,816
THE SUNOCO LOGO
MATCHES OUR KITCHEN.

266
00:11:24,882 --> 00:11:27,385
OH! WELL, THEN,
YES, OF COURSE.

267
00:11:27,452 --> 00:11:29,554
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO NOW?

268
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,022
PLAN "B", HAROLD.

269
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:32,590
SELL ME YOUR GIFT.

270
00:11:32,657 --> 00:11:34,092
I'D LOVE TO.

271
00:11:34,158 --> 00:11:36,060
THANKS A LOT.
BUT I CAN'T.

272
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:37,462
THAT WOULD
BE WRONG.

273
00:11:37,528 --> 00:11:38,996
AW, COME ON, HAROLD.

274
00:11:39,063 --> 00:11:41,332
IT'S IMPORTANT,
WHAT I GIVE HER.

275
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,800
YOU'RE JUST A NEPHEW.

276
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:46,838
SHE COULDN'T CARE LESS
ABOUT YOU.

277
00:11:46,904 --> 00:11:48,339
(Audience): AWWW!

278
00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:49,941
THAT'S NOT EVEN TRUE!

279
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:51,242
I KNOW SHE LIKES ME!

280
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:53,478
I LIKE HER AND
SHE KNOWS I LIKE HER

281
00:11:53,544 --> 00:11:56,347
BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN
HER BIRTHDAY.

282
00:11:56,414 --> 00:11:57,849
WAHHH.

283
00:11:57,915 --> 00:11:59,584
(Audience laughing)

284
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,953
TELL YOU WHAT YOU COULD DO.

285
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:03,855
ASK YOUR FRIENDS IF THEY HAVE

286
00:12:03,921 --> 00:12:06,357
ANY USELESS GIFTS
THEY GAVE THEIR WIVES

287
00:12:06,424 --> 00:12:08,559
BUT THE WIVES KNEW
IT WAS USELESS,

288
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:10,027
SO IT'S LAYING AROUND.

289
00:12:10,094 --> 00:12:13,998
SO YOU'RE SUGGESTING I GET
A USELESS GIFT FOR BERNICE?

290
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:17,868
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'LL BREAK
TRADITION HERE, UNCLE RED.

291
00:12:17,935 --> 00:12:19,870
(Audience laughing)

292
00:12:23,608 --> 00:12:25,309
UH, HELLO, MY NAME'S DALTON.

293
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:26,811
I AM A MAN.

294
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:28,312
(All): HI, DALTON!

295
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:30,314
HELLO, MEN.

296
00:12:30,381 --> 00:12:32,750
THE OTHER NIGHT,
I WAS WATCHING T.V.

297
00:12:32,817 --> 00:12:35,186
I HAD THE REMOTE CONTROL
IN MY HAND.

298
00:12:35,252 --> 00:12:38,122
MY WIFE WAS THERE
AND MY DAUGHTER WAS THERE

299
00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:41,726
AND I WAS FLIPPIN' THROUGH
THE CHANNELS LIKE ALWAYS,

300
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:46,330
'CAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING ON,
WHICH IS SO DAMN TYPICAL!

301
00:12:46,397 --> 00:12:48,699
ANYWAY, I WAS FLIPPIN'
AND FLIPPIN'

302
00:12:48,766 --> 00:12:51,836
AND FLIPPIN' AND FLIPPIN'
AND, UH, YOU KNOW...

303
00:12:51,902 --> 00:12:53,404
I KNEW I WAS DOING WRONG

304
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:55,539
BECAUSE THE T.V. GUIDE
WAS THERE.

305
00:12:55,606 --> 00:12:58,642
THE T.V. GUIDE, YOU CAN NEVER
TRUST WHAT IT SAYS

306
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:01,746
BECAUSE THE DESCRIPTIONS
ARE NEVER VERY HELPFUL!

307
00:13:01,812 --> 00:13:05,182
THE OTHER NIGHT, THEY HAD
THIS SHOW CALLED "FRIENDS".

308
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:08,853
I TURNED IT ON AND THERE WAS
NONE OF MY FRIENDS ON THEN.

309
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:11,255
ANYWAY, I WAS FLIPPIN'
AND FLIPPIN'

310
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:15,292
AND FLIPPIN' AND FLIPPIN'
AND SUDDENLY I HEAR THIS VOICE.

311
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:17,194
IT'S RIGHT IN MY HEAD.

312
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:18,863
IT WAS RIGHT THERE!

313
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:22,466
TURNED OUT IT WAS MY WIFE
BESIDE ME ON THE COUCH.

314
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:24,301
SCARED ME ANYWAY, THOUGH!

315
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:28,873
SHE SAID, "DALTON,
GIVE ME THAT REMOTE!"

316
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:32,810
YOU KNOW WHAT?

317
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:35,312
RIGHT THEN AND THERE...

318
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:37,815
I STOPPED FLIPPIN'...

319
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:41,819
AND I TURNED OVER
AND I HANDED THE REMOTE TO HER

320
00:13:41,886 --> 00:13:44,155
AND I SAID, "HONEY...

321
00:13:44,221 --> 00:13:46,457
"YOU... CHOOSE."

322
00:13:46,524 --> 00:13:49,827
(Gasping)

323
00:13:49,894 --> 00:13:51,829
WOW!

324
00:13:51,896 --> 00:13:54,331
BIG STUFF!

325
00:13:54,398 --> 00:13:59,103
THAT MADE ME FEEL
SO SICK TO MY STOMACH,

326
00:13:59,169 --> 00:14:00,704
BUT I DID IT!

327
00:14:00,771 --> 00:14:05,342
I LET MY WIFE CHOOSE
THE PROGRAMME SHE WANTED.

328
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:08,846
SHE WANTED TO SEE
"MARTHA STEWART LIVING".

329
00:14:08,913 --> 00:14:11,048
WE WATCHED IT
FOR QUITE A WHILE.

330
00:14:11,115 --> 00:14:13,784
I DON'T THINK
MARTHA STEWART IS LIVING.

331
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:17,788
I THINK THAT WAS SOME KIND OF
ROBOT THING ON THERE.

332
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,723
WE WATCHED IT FOR HOURS.

333
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,393
IT WAS THE WORST NIGHT
OF MY LIFE.

334
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:24,028
WE MUST HAVE WATCHED

335
00:14:24,094 --> 00:14:26,597
FOUR OR FIVE SHOWS
ON HOME DECORATING,

336
00:14:26,664 --> 00:14:29,800
ALL OF THEM FILLED
WITH IDEAS AND INFORMATION.

337
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:32,803
I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE
IDEAS AND INFORMATION.

338
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,006
I WANTED TO WATCH TELEVISION!

339
00:14:38,642 --> 00:14:41,712
(Red): MEANWHILE, BACK AT
"ADVENTURES WITH BILL",

340
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:43,180
WE GOT ALL...

341
00:14:43,247 --> 00:14:46,483
GOT THE WIENERS COOKED
AND THEY'RE READY TO PUT...

342
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,085
GOTTA BACK UP A LITTLE.

343
00:14:48,152 --> 00:14:50,287
DROP THE WIENERS INTO THE BUNS.

344
00:14:50,354 --> 00:14:51,922
THIS BRINGS ME BACK.

345
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:55,459
REMEMBER "THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW"
WHERE THE GUYS SPIN PLATES?

346
00:14:55,526 --> 00:14:58,629
GET ONE GOING, THEN THE OTHER
WOULD ALMOST FALL...

347
00:14:58,696 --> 00:15:00,831
THEN THE OTHER ONE,
THEN THEY GET--

348
00:15:00,898 --> 00:15:02,633
THEN HE'D ADD ANOTHER ONE

349
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:05,602
AND THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN...
THEY'RE GONE.

350
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:08,205
WHERE'S-- WHAT ARE YOU
DOING, BILL?

351
00:15:08,272 --> 00:15:10,340
THEY GOTTA GO INTO THE BUNS.

352
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:11,675
HOLD THEM THERE?

353
00:15:11,742 --> 00:15:13,677
UH-OH, BILL HAS A PLAN.

354
00:15:13,744 --> 00:15:16,013
ON THE HAT, DOWN THE SHOULDERS,

355
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,514
AND...

356
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:18,949
OH, BY GOLLY.

357
00:15:19,016 --> 00:15:20,751
PERFECT! OH, BY GOSH, YEAH.

358
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:22,386
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE READY--

359
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:24,455
THEY'RE WARM, THEY SMELL GREAT.

360
00:15:24,521 --> 00:15:25,789
JUST GONNA-- WHAT?

361
00:15:25,856 --> 00:15:27,558
NO?

362
00:15:27,624 --> 00:15:29,293
OH, BILL'S GOTTA PUT THE...

363
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:30,794
OH, MAN.

364
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:33,430
JUST A BIT OF THAT, BILL.

365
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:35,232
I'M NOT THAT FUSSY

366
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:36,567
ON THE...

367
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:37,968
OHHH...

368
00:15:38,035 --> 00:15:41,305
YEAH, JUST PUT
A LITTLE BIT ON THERE.

369
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:42,806
I'LL SAY WHEN.

370
00:15:42,873 --> 00:15:45,309
OK, WHEN.

371
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,710
WHEN.

372
00:15:48,045 --> 00:15:49,479
WHEN.

373
00:15:49,546 --> 00:15:50,814
OHHHHH!

374
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:52,816
WHEN!

375
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:54,318
THANK YOU, BILL.

376
00:15:54,384 --> 00:15:56,453
WANT TO CHECK THE HEARING AID.

377
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,355
A LITTLE BIT OF RELISH.

378
00:15:58,422 --> 00:16:02,326
NEED SOMETHING TO KILL
THE TASTE OF THE KETCHUP.

379
00:16:02,392 --> 00:16:03,827
JUST A LITTLE BIT.

380
00:16:03,894 --> 00:16:05,329
WHEN.

381
00:16:05,395 --> 00:16:06,830
WHOA! WHOA!

382
00:16:06,897 --> 00:16:08,899
YEAH, THAT SHOULD DO IT.

383
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,336
BOY, OH, BOY.

384
00:16:12,402 --> 00:16:14,338
OOOH!

385
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:17,307
BILL'S JUST GONNA PUT
SOME MUSTARD ON HIS.

386
00:16:17,374 --> 00:16:19,743
I DECIDED NOT TO HAVE
THE MUSTARD.

387
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,078
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

388
00:16:21,144 --> 00:16:22,746
HE COULDN'T GET 'ER OUT.

389
00:16:22,813 --> 00:16:24,381
OK, ALL RIGHT, YEAH, OK.

390
00:16:24,448 --> 00:16:25,849
YOU WANT ME TO HOLD--

391
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,018
YOU DID THE KETCHUP,
THE RELISH.

392
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:30,287
YOU WANT ME TO HOLD
THE HOT DOG--

393
00:16:30,354 --> 00:16:32,289
NO, NO, NO!

394
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:33,790
UH-UH, MM-MMM.

395
00:16:33,857 --> 00:16:36,293
LET'S TRY A SWITCH.... OHHH!

396
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,794
OHHH!

397
00:16:37,861 --> 00:16:40,831
A THOUGHT WENT THROUGH
MY MIND, BUT... NO.

398
00:16:40,897 --> 00:16:44,301
WE HAVE TO DO ANOTHER SHOW
NEXT WEEK... SO, UH,

399
00:16:44,368 --> 00:16:46,803
STAND BACK, BILL.

400
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,138
THERE YOU GO.

401
00:16:48,205 --> 00:16:50,374
JEEZ, I MAY HAVE MISSED THAT.

402
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,576
I COULD GO AGAIN, I SUPPOSE.

403
00:16:52,642 --> 00:16:55,312
BILL, I COULD GO AGAIN,
IF YOU WANT.

404
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:56,713
HUH?

405
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,883
THERE'S SOMETHING YOU DON'T SEE
VERY OFTEN...

406
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,319
AN ARM WITH A HOT DOG
ON EACH END.

407
00:17:02,385 --> 00:17:03,887
NO, THANKS, BILL.

408
00:17:06,389 --> 00:17:08,058
MMM!

409
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:11,661
(Red): HERE'S A COMBINATION
FISHING ROD AND BAIT PAIL,

410
00:17:11,728 --> 00:17:13,063
SENT BY A VIEWER.

411
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:19,002
I GOTTA GO HOME SOON.

412
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,737
I HAVE NOTHING FOR BERNICE.

413
00:17:20,804 --> 00:17:22,706
YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT LODGE MEMBERS

414
00:17:22,772 --> 00:17:25,108
AND STUFF THEY'VE BOUGHT
FOR
 THEIR
 WIVES.

415
00:17:25,175 --> 00:17:27,477
THE SELECTION WAS THERE,
WASN'T IT?

416
00:17:27,544 --> 00:17:29,613
YOU SHOULD HAVE
SEEN THE STUFF.

417
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,982
CREPE MAKERS,
HOT-AIR POPCORN POPPERS,

418
00:17:32,048 --> 00:17:35,418
INDIVIDUAL GRILLED-CHEESE
SANDWICH WAFFLE-IRON THINGS,

419
00:17:35,485 --> 00:17:38,889
A BREAD MAKER, ELECTRIC WIENER
WARMER... UNBELIEVABLE.

420
00:17:38,955 --> 00:17:40,223
WHY DIDN'T YOU

421
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,558
BUY HER ONE?

422
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,226
BERNICE ALREADY
HAS ALL THOSE.

423
00:17:43,293 --> 00:17:44,561
RIGHT, OK, YEAH.

424
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:46,296
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU COULD DO?

425
00:17:46,363 --> 00:17:48,231
GET HER A ROMANTIC INTANGIBLE.

426
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:50,767
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA --
ARE THEY ELECTRIC?

427
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:55,405
(Audience laughing)

428
00:17:55,472 --> 00:17:56,740
NO... NO, NO, NO.

429
00:17:56,806 --> 00:17:59,242
IT'S LIKE, ONE TIME...
ONE TIME, RIGHT?

430
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:02,579
I HAD THIS CRUSH ON A GIRL
SO I GAVE HER A POEM.

431
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:03,914
WELL, I WROTE ONE.

432
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,249
WHEN IT CAME TIME
TO GIVE IT TO HER,

433
00:18:06,316 --> 00:18:08,151
I PANICKED AND SWALLOWED IT.

434
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:10,854
I DIDN'T THINK SHE WANTED IT
AFTER THAT.

435
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,656
A POEM WON'T WORK, HAROLD.

436
00:18:12,722 --> 00:18:14,758
NOTHING RHYMES WITH "BERNICE".

437
00:18:14,824 --> 00:18:16,092
I KNOW WHAT I'LL DO.

438
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:17,994
I'LL BUILD HER SOMETHING,

439
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:20,497
ALL BY MYSELF,
RIGHT IN THE WORKSHOP.

440
00:18:20,563 --> 00:18:21,898
YEAH, MM-HMM, YEAH.

441
00:18:21,965 --> 00:18:26,069
NOTHING SAYS "I LIKE YOU"
LIKE GOOD ONE-SIDE PLYWOOD.

442
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:27,971
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT PORTION,

443
00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:30,073
WHERE WE EXPLORE
THOSE THREE WORDS

444
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,208
THAT MEN FIND
SO DIFFICULT TO SAY.

445
00:18:32,275 --> 00:18:34,377
(Audience):
"I DON'T KNOW!"

446
00:18:34,444 --> 00:18:37,247
NOW, JOINING MY UNCLE RED IS

447
00:18:37,313 --> 00:18:39,382
THE NEW PERSON
TO THE POSSUM LAKE AREA,

448
00:18:39,449 --> 00:18:41,384
MR. KEVIN BLACK!

449
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:43,987
(Applause and cheering)

450
00:18:44,054 --> 00:18:46,790
THE LETTER GOES AS FOLLOWS --
"DEAR EXPERTS,

451
00:18:46,856 --> 00:18:48,391
"LAST YEAR, MY WIFE AND I

452
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,560
"HEATED OUR COTTAGE
WITH ELECTRICITY.

453
00:18:50,627 --> 00:18:52,062
"WHEN THE BILL CAME,

454
00:18:52,128 --> 00:18:54,097
"I HAD TO CASH IN
A SAVINGS BOND

455
00:18:54,164 --> 00:18:55,532
"AND GET A SECOND JOB.

456
00:18:55,598 --> 00:18:58,601
"IS THERE A CHEAPER WAY
TO HEAT A COUNTRY HOME?"

457
00:18:58,668 --> 00:18:59,936
YEAH, THERE IS.

458
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:03,006
IT'S A SPECIAL SUBSTANCE
WE HAVE UP HERE

459
00:19:03,072 --> 00:19:04,774
IN THE NON-CITY AREAS.

460
00:19:04,841 --> 00:19:07,010
IT'S CALLED WOOD, ALL RIGHT?

461
00:19:07,076 --> 00:19:09,078
IT GROWS ON TREES UP HERE.

462
00:19:09,145 --> 00:19:11,614
(Audience laughing)

463
00:19:11,681 --> 00:19:13,383
(Laughing)

464
00:19:13,449 --> 00:19:14,717
NO,

465
00:19:14,784 --> 00:19:16,286
HE'S KIDDING.

466
00:19:16,352 --> 00:19:17,787
GO WITH GAS.

467
00:19:17,854 --> 00:19:21,691
I'M BUILDING A PLACE HERE AND
I'M PUTTING IN A GAS FURNACE.

468
00:19:21,758 --> 00:19:23,660
IT IS CLEAN AND INEXPENSIVE.

469
00:19:23,726 --> 00:19:25,328
THIS WILL BE INTERESTING.

470
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:28,798
I THOUGHT YOU HAD TO HOOK
A GAS FURNACE UP
 TO
 SOMETHING.

471
00:19:28,865 --> 00:19:30,233
YOU KNOW, UH...

472
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,169
I BELIEVE THEY CALL THEM
GAS PIPELINES.

473
00:19:33,236 --> 00:19:34,871
NOBODY HAS GAS
UP HERE.

474
00:19:34,938 --> 00:19:36,206
OK.

475
00:19:36,272 --> 00:19:38,942
OK, WELL, THEN, THE...

476
00:19:39,008 --> 00:19:40,877
UH, THAT...

477
00:19:40,944 --> 00:19:42,946
... TREE THING WOULD BE
THE WAY TO GO.

478
00:19:43,012 --> 00:19:44,280
ALL RIGHT, YEAH.

479
00:19:44,347 --> 00:19:47,417
IT MIGHT BE KIND OF FUN,
ROLLING UP THE SLEEVES,

480
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:49,419
SWINGING AN AXE.

481
00:19:49,485 --> 00:19:51,421
NO, WE USE CHAINSAWS UP HERE.

482
00:19:51,487 --> 00:19:53,056
I CAME HERE FOR THE QUIET.

483
00:19:53,122 --> 00:19:54,691
CHAINSAWS ARE AWFUL NOISY.

484
00:19:54,757 --> 00:19:58,595
I THINK YOU'D RATHER LISTEN
TO A CHAINSAW FOR A WEEK

485
00:19:58,661 --> 00:20:01,464
THAN LISTEN TO AN AXE
FOR FIVE MONTHS.

486
00:20:01,531 --> 00:20:02,732
ALL RIGHT,
WELL,

487
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,067
I'LL HIRE A LOCAL.

488
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:06,069
THERE MUST BE GUYS
WILLING TO WORK

489
00:20:06,135 --> 00:20:07,637
FOR 80, 90 CENTS AN HOUR.

490
00:20:07,704 --> 00:20:09,072
WHAT ABOUT
YOU, RED?

491
00:20:09,138 --> 00:20:11,274
YOU NEED SOME
EXTRA PIN MONEY?

492
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:13,609
NO, THANKS, I HAVE ENOUGH PINS.

493
00:20:13,676 --> 00:20:15,378
DON'T THINK YOU WANT ME

494
00:20:15,445 --> 00:20:18,214
SWINGING AN AXE
UP AT BLOOD POINT.

495
00:20:18,281 --> 00:20:20,316
IT'S CALLED BLUFF POINT.

496
00:20:20,383 --> 00:20:23,419
NOT WHEN UNCLE RED'S THROUGH
WITH IT.

497
00:20:23,486 --> 00:20:27,090
NO, THANK YOU,
I GOT MY OWN WOOD TO CHOP.

498
00:20:27,156 --> 00:20:29,525
YOU KNOW, I DON'T MEAN
TO BE RUDE,

499
00:20:29,592 --> 00:20:34,197
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU GRASP THE
CONCEPT OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT.

500
00:20:34,263 --> 00:20:37,166
WE DON'T, AND WE REALLY
APPRECIATE THE COMPLIMENT.

501
00:20:37,233 --> 00:20:39,302
SEE, UH,

502
00:20:39,368 --> 00:20:41,838
HOW IT WORKS IS
IF I CHOP YOUR FIREWOOD,

503
00:20:41,904 --> 00:20:44,073
I GOTTA HIRE SOMEBODY
TO CHOP MINE.

504
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,275
HE'S GOTTA HIRE SOMEBODY,
AND SO ON.

505
00:20:46,342 --> 00:20:50,713
WE THINK IT'S EASIER IF
EVERYBODY DOES THEIR OWN WORK

506
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:54,450
AND NOBODY HAS TO SPEND MONEY
THEY DON'T HAVE.

507
00:20:54,517 --> 00:20:56,719
THEN YOU HAVE NO LOCAL ECONOMY.

508
00:20:56,786 --> 00:21:00,490
NO, BUT WE HAVE THIS THING
CALLED A LOCAL REALITY.

509
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:01,824
WELL, THAT MAY...

510
00:21:01,891 --> 00:21:04,627
THAT MAY BE ALL RIGHT
FOR THE BOONIES,

511
00:21:04,694 --> 00:21:08,631
BUT I WOULD HATE TO SEE
WHAT THE CITY WOULD LOOK LIKE

512
00:21:08,698 --> 00:21:10,500
IF WE OPERATED THAT WAY.

513
00:21:10,566 --> 00:21:13,402
YOU'D HAVE MORE TREES
AND LESS GAS.

514
00:21:13,469 --> 00:21:17,273
(Laughing and applause)

515
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,008
THIS IS THE ONE, HAROLD.

516
00:21:19,075 --> 00:21:21,911
GET OFF THERE, YOU GOL-DARNED
SON OF A GUN.

517
00:21:21,978 --> 00:21:23,513
I GOT 'ER THIS TIME!

518
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:25,848
CAN YOU IMAGINE
WHAT BERNICE IS--

519
00:21:25,915 --> 00:21:27,917
I COME HOME -- LOOK AT THIS!

520
00:21:27,984 --> 00:21:29,418
WHAT DO YOU THINK, HUH?

521
00:21:29,485 --> 00:21:30,753
A DESK SET, HAROLD.

522
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,089
THAT'S A GAS-POWERED
PENCIL SHARPENER.

523
00:21:33,155 --> 00:21:34,957
WE GOT A ONE-TON HOLE PUNCH.

524
00:21:35,024 --> 00:21:36,926
HUH? EH? HUH?

525
00:21:36,993 --> 00:21:39,228
WHAT DO
YOU THINK?

526
00:21:39,295 --> 00:21:40,630
AHHH!

527
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,768
OHHHH! ASH TRAY.

528
00:21:45,835 --> 00:21:47,270
SHE DON'T
SMOKE.

529
00:21:47,336 --> 00:21:49,171
I'LL BUY HER CIGARETTES.

530
00:21:49,238 --> 00:21:50,740
(Audience laughing)

531
00:21:50,806 --> 00:21:53,075
COME ON, SELL ME YOUR PRESENT.

532
00:21:53,142 --> 00:21:54,610
NO CAN DO,
NO CAN DO.

533
00:21:54,677 --> 00:21:56,112
I WORKED HARD
ON IT.

534
00:21:56,178 --> 00:21:57,446
IT'S SENTIMENTAL.

535
00:21:57,513 --> 00:21:59,915
IT MEANS
SO MUCH.
FIFTY BUCKS.

536
00:21:59,982 --> 00:22:01,951
SOLD.
ALL RIGHT, GOOD.

537
00:22:02,018 --> 00:22:04,086
LET'S GET THIS
FROU-FROU STUFF OFF

538
00:22:04,153 --> 00:22:06,288
SO SHE KNOWS IT'S FROM ME.

539
00:22:06,355 --> 00:22:08,391
WHAT IS THIS, A CUSHION?

540
00:22:08,457 --> 00:22:10,326
IT'S NEEDLEPOINT!

541
00:22:10,393 --> 00:22:12,395
I WORKED REALLY HARD ON THAT.

542
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:13,796
"TO AUNT BERNICE.

543
00:22:13,863 --> 00:22:16,399
"WITH LOVE,
YOUR NEPHEW HAROLD."

544
00:22:16,465 --> 00:22:17,733
(Possum squeal)

545
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,468
MEETING TIME, UNCLE RED.

546
00:22:19,535 --> 00:22:21,704
I'LL SEE YOU THERE IN A MINUTE.

547
00:22:21,771 --> 00:22:23,639
YOU'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE?

548
00:22:23,706 --> 00:22:25,908
ACTUALLY, YOU LOOK DOWN
ALREADY.

549
00:22:25,975 --> 00:22:28,811
(Laughing)

550
00:22:28,878 --> 00:22:30,913
WELL... IF MY WIFE IS...

551
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,348
OH, MY GOSH.

552
00:22:32,415 --> 00:22:34,917
ARE YOU WATCHING, BERNICE?

553
00:22:34,984 --> 00:22:36,919
WELL, UH...

554
00:22:36,986 --> 00:22:40,022
I GUESS I'LL BE SLEEPING
ON THE PORCH TONIGHT

555
00:22:40,089 --> 00:22:41,757
BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

556
00:22:41,824 --> 00:22:43,826
I'LL HAVE THIS CUSHION AND...

557
00:22:43,893 --> 00:22:46,162
HEY, HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
AND REMEMBER,

558
00:22:46,228 --> 00:22:47,930
YOU'RE NOT GETTING OLDER.

559
00:22:47,997 --> 00:22:49,932
YOU'RE GETTING...

560
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:52,334
... MORE FORGIVING, I'M HOPING.

561
00:22:52,401 --> 00:22:54,770
THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

562
00:22:54,837 --> 00:22:57,940
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND THE NEEDLEPOINT MANIAC,

563
00:22:58,007 --> 00:23:00,442
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

564
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:03,412
(Applause and cheering)

565
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:05,781
(Possum squeal)

566
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:11,887
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

567
00:23:11,954 --> 00:23:13,222
(Red): SIT DOWN.

568
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:14,657
IF ANYBODY'S TALKING

569
00:23:14,723 --> 00:23:16,659
TO BUSTER HADFIELD, I WANT
