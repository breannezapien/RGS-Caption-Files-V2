1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,350
You know, the morning coffee is as much a
part of the Canadian experience as two

2
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:16,870
official languages 10 provinces or one work
in helicopter, according to the encyclopedia

3
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,040
Possam Logica.

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,790
We have more drive thru coffee joints than
public urinals.

5
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,100
I wonder if we lose so many trees every
year.

6
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,310
And there's even a coffee drinkers lingo.

7
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:34,970
For example, you got regular black cream
only double double or in Harold's case,

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,840
single single. And they have these contests
where if you drink enough coffee, you win a

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,310
year supply of sleeping pills.

10
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,950
All you got to do is flip up the lip to see
what you win.

11
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,010
Hey, I want something here.

12
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:01,270
It's like a three wheeled all terrain
vehicle, some type C, it's a tri engine.

13
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,310
I know that says try again.

14
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,460
They great big, big wake up at the lines
this week.

15
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:31,820
You know, a lot of people in our area like
to collect string.

16
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:37,370
A lot of people in our area like to collect
dust every 10 years.

17
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,700
The town has a competition to see who has
the biggest string ball

18
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,380
Rid of the red.

19
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,970
Check this out.

20
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:55,310
What is that hair? It's nothing.

21
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,900
Wait, a second, is that your string ball,
huh?

22
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,910
I had a bad year.

23
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,860
I hope you weren't expecting to win the
competition with that unit there.

24
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,790
No, no, no.

25
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,150
I know what I was thinking.

26
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:15,490
I was always thinking that, Oh, we can all
combine our string and then we'd have one

27
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,870
giant entry from the lodge.

28
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,820
Yeah. All right, but I'm not going 50 50 on
prize money with that little dust money, you

29
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,420
got there.

30
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,200
No, no, no, but but maybe something like 80,
20.

31
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,300
How about 90, 10?

32
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,220
Ok, how about we meet in the middle?

33
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,780
Ok. Eighty five, 20.

34
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,890
Yeah. Ok, good. Yeah.

35
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,870
You know, these remind me of planets, they
look like planets, that they look like

36
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,350
planets,

37
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,180
They look like planets. Yeah, yeah.

38
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,370
This is like Neptune and Pluto.

39
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,100
No, no, no, no. I'm normal in your goofy.

40
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,150
It's time for the Possum Lodge word game.

41
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,010
Today's price is a coupon for a possum lake
boat crews on the historic steamboat.

42
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,750
The Maryland bell duration of cruise subject
to performance of bilge pump.

43
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,960
Ok, cover your ears there, Dalton Red.

44
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,540
You've got 30 seconds to get Dalton Humphrey
to say this word.

45
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,840
A bout of blow.

46
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,140
All right,

47
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,490
Whiskey and goat.

48
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,920
Ok, Dalton, this is an expression you hear a
lot.

49
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,230
Get out and stay out.

50
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:40,920
Ok. Ok. When a soldier turns around and goes
in the opposite direction, they call that the

51
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,620
French. No, no.

52
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,110
Ok. Ok.

53
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,600
Ok, if you're sailing and the boom swings
hard from one side to the other, that means

54
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,000
that soon you'll be coming to.

55
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,230
Ok. No. Oh, I know, I know Americans make
fun of the way Canadians say this.

56
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,050
Please register your firearms.

57
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,260
I read almost out of time. I know, I know.

58
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,730
Ok, OK, don't remember last week you and
Marie were sparring a little and I said, What

59
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,200
was all that yelling?

60
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,260
You know, we were sparring, right?

61
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,610
You know, I mean, when school's more than
three rounds, that's about.

62
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:27,720
Yeah. Rothschild

63
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,860
sewage and septic

64
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,480
Sucking services, because your fruit should
get right, not your lawn.

65
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,200
Well, see, you're probably familiar with
these garbage disposal units in my books,

66
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,480
there's no better appliance for taking care
of vegetables.

67
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,620
It grinds them up in that kind of a compact
form and then fires them down the drain.

68
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,540
Kind of like what the human body does, but
I'm thinking, wouldn't it be great to be able

69
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,560
to do the same thing with outdoor junk like
trees or old school buses?

70
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,910
All it takes is a little imagination, some
mechanical ability and neighbors who mind

71
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:10,990
their own business. Ok, now for us to grind
up all this junk you see here, we're going to

72
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,210
need a pretty powerful garbage disposal.

73
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,730
Whereas all we have is this old cement
mixer.

74
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:21,010
But to me, this is like when a woman marries
the wrong man rather than starting over with

75
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:26,220
somebody new. She just makes a few
modifications that an agitator in there for

76
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:30,850
mix it up the cement. But it's not strong
enough to grind up, say, cast iron.

77
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:35,260
So we're going to augment the blades by
sticking a couple of prospecting tools on

78
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,750
them. Ok, now see these babies here.

79
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,470
These are made for a pound and rock, I mean,
these are strong.

80
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,100
They got diamond dust in there and titanium
plutonium and kryptonite.

81
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,580
I think we just got to make sure that we
attach some real solid.

82
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,330
May. Ok.

83
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,980
I think we're pretty much ready to go here,
I cut some holes in the bottom of her so that

84
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,060
the pulverized scrap can just run right
through the bottom of our garbage disposal.

85
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,020
And of course, we got our garden hose in
here.

86
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,700
This is so the water will run throughout the
entire garbage disposal process.

87
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,500
Otherwise, this could be dangerous.

88
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,970
And as you know, safety is what I'm all
about.

89
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,410
Ok, but of course, the key to the whole
process is to mount the unit over an open

90
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,580
manhole. That way, the output in your
garbage disposal will flow safely and

91
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,360
smoothly into the sewer system that you pay
for out of your tax dollars.

92
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,930
Oh, sure, I guess I could come out of this
thing over the kitchen sink, but I've been

93
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,820
married too long to make that mistake again.

94
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:53,160
Oh, yeah, I had that little more power to
the unit, so I took off the little belt that

95
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,250
ran to the electric motor and I put it on a
big belt.

96
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,510
Knock on wood, small block ain't here, but
if you're were grinding, say I-beams might

97
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,400
want to go with a Hemi or even a V12.

98
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:08,120
See, the beauty of this system is you can
gear the power to the size of the job.

99
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,710
Ok, I've had to rethink the strategy a
little bit here.

100
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:40,200
I'm actually not going to start the unit up
until after I put the scrap metal in it and

101
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:45,300
after I put this lid on it first with the
lid on there and I can't run the water

102
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,020
through it. So I'm pre cleaning all the
mechanism with some gasoline.

103
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,840
But of course, cleanliness is not enough,
you know, we also need to add some

104
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,190
lubrication. We've all been there, haven't
we?

105
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,220
Well, I'm just going to cover the blades
with oil.

106
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,390
We're good to go. I'll tell you one thing, I
have this yard cleaned up in no time to

107
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,280
remember the women don't find you handsome.

108
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,900
They should at least find your handy.

109
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,510
When a man gets close to retirement age, he
starts having some weird thoughts.

110
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,370
No, not those weird thoughts.

111
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:12,950
I mean, the ones about him having all this
free time, and if he doesn't use it for

112
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:16,730
something productive, he's going to feel
like somehow he wasted it.

113
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:23,060
The next thing you know, he's signing up for
mambo lessons, learning how to cook and

114
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,760
carving letter openers out of cow patties
with a chainsaw.

115
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,320
This is a huge mistake.

116
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,980
Don't be swayed by what the other retired
guys are doing.

117
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:38,740
Don't join a gym, don't get together with a
bunch of other retired guys and form a Motown

118
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,760
cover band.

119
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,050
Most importantly, do not write a book about
your life.

120
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,290
You only have enough good stuff or maybe two
chapters.

121
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,670
Most of the interesting things you've done,
you can't even spell.

122
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:58,930
And for sure, you're not going to like the
ending, so just continue to do exactly what

123
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,730
you did that brought you to this point.

124
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:06,160
Northam. Happy retirement, remember, I'm
pulling for you.

125
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,480
We're all in this together.

126
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:16,800
Rothchild, sewage and septic sucking services
satisfaction guaranteed for double your

127
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,730
sewage back.

128
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,260
Well, Harold and I put our two string balls
together, and it's a pretty decent size, then

129
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,550
come on here, I'll show them what we got.

130
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,140
Ok, I'm coming. You're going to love this.

131
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,030
Well, that should fill in your afternoon.

132
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,860
And Dalton's bringing his string ball over
to Atari's, and according to Emory, he's got

133
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,880
a fair sized one, too.

134
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,770
I hope I didn't misunderstand her on.

135
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,440
Oh, that would be him now.

136
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,700
And where's the string box?

137
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:55,750
It's right behind me.

138
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:01,960
For me, and

139
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,400
Now we're OK, we're OK.

140
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,340
It's stopped at the hill ow, ow ow ow, ow
ow.

141
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,260
Rolling back. Oh.

142
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,800
Know spring can be so dangerous.

143
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:22,450
I've never seen so much string in my life,
this would be like a dream if it was a good

144
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,020
thing.

145
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,050
Herald this is a good thing. That baby is a
winner.

146
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,530
Don't yeah, just got to figure out how to
get it down to the community center.

147
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,750
Maybe we had a vehicle. We could push it down
there.

148
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,490
I mean, it rolls pretty good.

149
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,920
Of course, the possum van.

150
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,270
All right. Look, I'll go around outside and
I'll pull on it.

151
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,920
You guys push on. Push Dalton.

152
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,420
Come on, Harold. You can help out.

153
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,920
Just like a big wedgie.

154
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,620
All right, push, don't push.

155
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,460
Ok, OK. All right.

156
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,470
All right. Stand back up, Karen Dalton, look
out.

157
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,540
I don't want anybody to get hurt. It's
common.

158
00:11:59,590 --> 00:11:59,860
Yeah.

159
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,220
First, meet Dale Annatto behind the lines
down by the lake, we're going to do a little

160
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,550
fishing bill pulled in just a little snug, I
felt, Yeah.

161
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:19,390
And I was giving him a little grief on that
next thing, you know, had does exactly the

162
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,300
same thing. We really got to widen that
road.

163
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,600
So that comes around, we're giving him
grief.

164
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:31,040
He didn't put that thing in park, he didn't
put the emergency brake on and he's got a

165
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,370
carburetor problem. And actually we just
found that just grab anything, grab it.

166
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:39,750
Oh oh. See, that's what that's what Russell
can do to if you're going to she's actually

167
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,710
starting to pick up speed and heading right
for the lake and then.

168
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,000
That is our local car wash, but you don't
get your car back.

169
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,260
So we're enjoying that, but we don't want
to.

170
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,170
No, no, we're good. No. That's a shame.

171
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,520
That's a shame. No, that's a shame.

172
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,550
Yeah, yeah. And that tells us why he's
upset.

173
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,530
Because actually, walls are still in the
vehicle.

174
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,340
So I tell him to just calm down, that's all
right.

175
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,050
Don't worry, we'll get you out.

176
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,950
You know what? This is a modern age of
technology, and what I have on the front of

177
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:13,090
the possam van is a 50 tonne power winch.

178
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,320
And if you just just wait.

179
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,490
Everything's going to be great.

180
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,130
Don't worry, you got nothing to worry about.

181
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,630
Got her all under control.

182
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:27,030
Everything's fine. Just give me a couple of
minutes and I'll have him right out of there.

183
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,730
Not a problem. Not a problem.

184
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,360
All right, boys. Oh, taken care of.

185
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,180
But of course, these two can't trust
technology, they figure they better rescue

186
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,240
Walter on their own. They don't trust the
winch and all that, so on.

187
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,940
So first thing they do is they try a ladder.

188
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,330
And how did that go?

189
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,030
Know you just got to relax sometimes in
life, just kind of go.

190
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,510
Oh, a little inflatables, wading pool and a
pickaxe.

191
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,040
Yeah, and I saw that one coming.

192
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,210
Did you get them? Are you OK, boys?

193
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:17,440
And I come up there and just hope the winds
just casually on to the rear axle of a unit

194
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,010
and you won't believe the power of this
thing is unbelievable.

195
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,310
And what do you got the whole canoe in a
life jacket or two?

196
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,530
It's not necessary, boys, but you know, you
do what you want.

197
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,770
I think we'll be fine. Any luck?

198
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,720
So I'm wheeling her in.

199
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,260
Everything is going great, and I was a
little surprised, did not get the complete

200
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:51,970
vehicle. But I'm thinking, you know, if we
if we line up the bumper assembly and the

201
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:55,060
tail lights, you know, starting, you know,
she's starting to take shape.

202
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,030
So let's go back and get the rest of her.

203
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:04,670
And again, it's it's just a bit of a waiting
game, but everything's fine.

204
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,790
What do we got here? That's a that's a flare
gun bell.

205
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,410
Careful, careful with that bill.

206
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,840
Careful now.

207
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:22,060
Ok, fine. So and I'm going to hook her just
right on to the bumper, and she should be a

208
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,590
lot lighter with that rear assembly out of
there.

209
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:29,710
I think will be good. That would be the
trunk lid.

210
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,750
I don't know what that was.

211
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,530
And that is the front quarter panel.

212
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,140
We're getting there, we're making progress
here.

213
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:48,310
A bucket seat. Turning into a bit of a
jigsaw puzzle, this unit and there's the

214
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,710
hood, and I got her together pretty good.

215
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,610
And the guys are just one last attempt, I
think.

216
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,830
What are they going to take this time?

217
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,970
You know, really not necessary fellows.

218
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,510
I can I can bring Walter up.

219
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,480
He's in pretty much the same technique.

220
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,500
So you're safe, the car is back together,
and there's an important lesson in all of

221
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:18,790
this. You can either be patient or you can
be a patient.

222
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:36,590
You know, my wife says that I have this bad
habit of generalizing about things, so I

223
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,880
throw a trick question at her.

224
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,030
I ask her, Is it always wrong to generalize?

225
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,580
Yeah. That's Dr.

226
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,320
That's called a conundrum.

227
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,940
She stuck for an answer.

228
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,160
But then I'm stuck for a place to sleep.

229
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:53,420
But there is one thing I can generalize guys
like myself.

230
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,780
We can tell you which page of the newspaper
has the sunshine girl on it.

231
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,560
We can tell you the hours of operation of
every bare star within the two hour drive.

232
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,130
We can't seem to remember to replace the
empty toilet paper roll.

233
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,050
So I have come up with a way to do it
automatically.

234
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:12,110
I put a cap on the bottom end of this little
piece of ductwork here, cut a hole in her the

235
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:15,050
same size as the core in the center of the
toilet paper roll.

236
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,860
Now, whenever I come to the end of a roll,
the weight of the other rolls versus the

237
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,350
cardboard out and drops the new roll into
place.

238
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,540
It's a gravity feed like most Thompson at a
buffet.

239
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,160
But of course, now it's not enough to have
something practical in your home.

240
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,900
It also needs to be decorative.

241
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,640
Huh? Don't worry.

242
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:42,510
I even got that one figured out Bernice is
going to love this.

243
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:46,800
It's not just the toilet paper dispenser,
it's what I call my jumbo model.

244
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,690
Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt the
Red-Green show so that I may bring you the

245
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,000
following important environmental message.

246
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:05,050
Greetings, campers, ranger Gord here with
another one of my patented wilderness safety

247
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:13,510
tips, say now here's a sight to see a couple
of happy go lucky noodle heads getting ready

248
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,890
to leave their campfire.

249
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,930
But what's this?

250
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,450
Look closer, everyone smoldering embers just
waiting to burst into a raging inferno.

251
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,730
All it will take is a single gust of wind.

252
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,150
I'm Erin's newspaper

253
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,890
And, of course, a carelessly tossed five
gallon can of gasoline.

254
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,890
Unfortunately, these two were smart.

255
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,400
They're wearing flame retardant clothing
perfect for smothering the flames.

256
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,290
Well, that's flannel ranger gore Wesley.

257
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:53,580
Oops.

258
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,890
Good thing I brought this bucket of sand.

259
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,790
So remember, folks never parade around naked
in a public campground.

260
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,370
It's just common sense, isn't it?

261
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,710
Well, that could have gone better.

262
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,990
Well, it was a bad plan.

263
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:34,610
It was a great plan, Harold Van had no
trouble pushing that gigantic string ball.

264
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:39,050
You know, if the community center had it
been uphill from here, we'd have no problem.

265
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:39,800
But oh

266
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,850
No. Why didn't he just step on the gas, get
the van in front of the ball and then at

267
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,260
least you could have slowed it down

268
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,800
And pass on a solid line, Harold.

269
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:51,820
That is illegal.

270
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,740
Well, so he's knocking down the community
center.

271
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,040
Oh man, we got trouble, boys.

272
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,120
No, we do not have trouble.

273
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,970
There's nothing about that string ball that
ties us to the crime.

274
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,570
Oh, really?

275
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,740
Well, when the ball hit the peak of the roof
of the community center, it started to one

276
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:10,690
unwind and it started to come back the same
way it went, which means it's leaving a trail

277
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:11,410
that leads right

278
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,340
To the lodge.

279
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,370
Well, I don't want to spend my sexually
active years in prison.

280
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,370
Now, Harold, actually it might be best.

281
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,580
But don't panic. I'm just going to get rid
of the evidence.

282
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,720
Now you guys go ahead, I'll be right down.

283
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,610
My wife is watching, I'll be coming straight
home.

284
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,950
After the meeting today, I learned all about
sharing.

285
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:53,210
I shared my string ball or shared my of van
almost shared a cell.

286
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:58,400
And you I'm kind of hoping that sharing
continues on into the night, but again,

287
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,960
that's your call. And the rest of you,
thanks for watching on behalf of myself and

288
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,700
Harold and the whole gang up here for some
lunch.

289
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,410
Keep a stick on the ice.

290
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:23,300
All right. Hongkongers hardly know any value,
hence from the

291
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:28,760
mantra a I'm a man that I could change if I
have to.

292
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,120
I guess I am good news.

293
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,480
Man spoke with the police chief and they're
not going to press any charges.

294
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:39,230
Apparently, they have laws against strings
of crime, but nothing against crime of

295
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:39,860
strings.
