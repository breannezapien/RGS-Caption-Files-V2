1
00:00:01,868 --> 00:00:05,705
Economists have a whole bunch of theories to
explain the high cost of living, but I'll

2
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:10,944
tell you what it is. Vehicle inspections see
this little stone chip on the windshield

3
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:12,912
here. Well, they'll make me fix that.

4
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:14,714
Is that crazy or what?

5
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:18,985
I mean, what is the point of being able to
negotiate an automobile purchase a twenty

6
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:22,422
five dollars if I then got to spend one
hundred bucks putting a new windshield into

7
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,858
work? That's a recipe for disaster.

8
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:26,826
While I have a different recipe.

9
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:37,570
At one large egg to windshield using
hand-held convection oven, cook eggs until no

10
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:47,514
longer running. And to really fault the
inspector stick, one of

11
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,382
these magnetic signs on the side of the
vehicle.

12
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,706
Yeah. No, actually, I can really use that,
I'm a little bit upset.

13
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,141
Look it up in my mailbox here.

14
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:23,583
I haven't been this mad since that lap
dancer offered me the seniors discount card.

15
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,451
Yeah. See, you can use this.

16
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,153
You just to replace your mailbox.

17
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:28,921
Well, that's your hamster cage.

18
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:30,490
Yeah. Yeah, it's OK. He's safe.

19
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:31,824
I took him out and I put him in your sock
drawer.

20
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,729
You know, I wondered why that one pair was so
hard to unroll.

21
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:42,035
Actually, that's not going to work as a
mailbox here, because the less Iranian and

22
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,237
then anybody walking by can see my mail.

23
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,639
Oh yeah, all those hemorrhoid pamphlets and
stuff.

24
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,911
Look, they got me, too.

25
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:55,948
Oh, man, you know what it is, it's a darn
teenagers say they hang out the car window

26
00:01:55,948 --> 00:01:59,452
there. They've got a baseball bat and they
grand slam their mailboxes into the next

27
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,355
county and they think that's fun.

28
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,058
Hey. Ok, well, it is fun, but not for us.

29
00:02:06,325 --> 00:02:08,027
You don't know his teenage years.

30
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,529
It can be anybody. You know it could be.

31
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:14,567
Could he could be Roy the mailman?

32
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,536
Yeah, maybe Roy went nuts and he did it.

33
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:24,544
Whoever heard of a postal worker going nuts,
why is it the today's teens are have to wreck

34
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,179
everything, whatever happened to sex and
drinking?

35
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,049
Why would you be asking him?

36
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:42,495
It's time for the

37
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,230
Possum Lodge word game.

38
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:57,143
Today's prize is a coupon for a free pony
from the Screaming Pony Breeding Center.

39
00:02:58,844 --> 00:03:01,881
Where every pony is a little horse.

40
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:06,719
Ok. Edgar, cover your ears and your cup.

41
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:10,723
Forget it. You got 30 seconds to get Edgar
to say this word.

42
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,793
Pool pool.

43
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,095
All right, Mr and go.

44
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:17,630
Ok. Edgar Edgar.

45
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,900
This is a game where you try to put the
balls into the pockets.

46
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:23,469
I don't play those kinds of games.

47
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:30,977
Ok. Ok. You can swim at a fancy hotel if it
has one of these

48
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,578
A flooded basement.

49
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:38,517
I got an idea. Say loop.

50
00:03:38,517 --> 00:03:42,154
Backwards loop.

51
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:46,359
All right. Ok, look. Ok.

52
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,297
When a man and a woman decide to have
children, their genes

53
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:54,300
End up on the floor.

54
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,004
Almost out of time, right? No, I know, I
know.

55
00:03:59,338 --> 00:04:03,209
Ok, OK, I know when you have a bunch of
talented people together, what's that called?

56
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,077
Certainly not this show.

57
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:08,848
Well, that, Gary, you're on it, you know?

58
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:12,351
Well, one person doesn't make a talent pool,
right?

59
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:13,252
There we go.

60
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:27,633
Can you smell me now?

61
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:31,804
Yeah. Good.

62
00:04:39,578 --> 00:04:42,214
Can you still smell good?

63
00:04:48,587 --> 00:04:49,622
Can you smell me now?

64
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:56,028
Good. Can you smell me now?

65
00:04:56,428 --> 00:05:00,499
Good Rothchild sewage and septic sucking
services.

66
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,037
Can you still smell me? Could we smell bad?

67
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,505
So you don't have to.

68
00:05:09,775 --> 00:05:11,644
No, I'm a guy who likes to eat a lot of hot
dogs.

69
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:17,082
You can probably tell I'm cooking myself on
one of these barbecue grill units here.

70
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:20,519
And I always cooked way too many, but
there's never any left over.

71
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,424
So my wife got me this bike hoping that if I
ride this thing, I would drop a few pounds,

72
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:26,992
plus I'd be farther from the food.

73
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:31,897
I'm thinking there's a way to ride this bike
that will actually enhance the hot dog

74
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:33,232
barbecue and experience.

75
00:05:33,632 --> 00:05:35,968
Ok, first thing you want to do is remove the
rear wheel.

76
00:05:41,473 --> 00:05:43,342
Next, you want to get the rim off of the
wheel.

77
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:45,144
Now, I don't mean the tire.

78
00:05:45,377 --> 00:05:47,179
I meant the tire. I would have said the
tire, wouldn't I?

79
00:05:48,213 --> 00:05:49,648
And there's lots of ways of getting that off
there.

80
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,650
You could cut that with a torch.

81
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,218
You could hack it off with an axe.

82
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:56,622
You could just wail the whole thing on a big
rock a few hundred times.

83
00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:01,727
But the smart way is to take a pair of side
cutters and cut this bolt right where it

84
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,394
meets the rim.

85
00:06:18,443 --> 00:06:27,819
They. Now you just bend the spokes away from
the sprocket side of the wheel.

86
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:31,890
They're easy to bend. Bikes are generally
soft spoken.

87
00:06:33,825 --> 00:06:35,327
And these aren't just folks anymore.

88
00:06:36,528 --> 00:06:41,633
They're skewers. I mean, hot dogs taste at
any time, but they're even better after

89
00:06:41,633 --> 00:06:42,801
they've got a few miles on them.

90
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:56,281
To me, nothing says class like rotisserie
sounds French like Brasier.

91
00:06:57,015 --> 00:07:01,420
And to make rotisserie turn, this is the
part the furnace is going to love because

92
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,157
I'll be riding the bike and down the chain
and brake cable.

93
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:09,227
But she's all going to pay off because I'm
not just getting exercise.

94
00:07:09,394 --> 00:07:10,696
I'm peddling my wares.

95
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,465
Remember, women don't find you handsome.

96
00:07:13,732 --> 00:07:15,100
They should at least find your handy.

97
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,710
Now, at this point, I like to add a little
barbecue sauce.

98
00:07:25,043 --> 00:07:25,811
No problem.

99
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,658
Getting some claim action, I want to throw a
little water on the fire again.

100
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:49,668
No problem. Ok, if the water doesn't put out
the

101
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:51,570
fire, all we got to do is pick up the pace a
little.

102
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,505
Don't forget this is a 10 speed.

103
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,654
Ok. They were to go.

104
00:08:20,065 --> 00:08:23,034
I have a little advice for all you guys out
there with beards.

105
00:08:24,102 --> 00:08:26,338
If you've had your beard for five years or
more.

106
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:28,139
That's a commitment.

107
00:08:29,441 --> 00:08:32,677
Do not under any circumstances, shave it
off.

108
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:37,148
You may think that has time has passed.

109
00:08:37,482 --> 00:08:42,554
You've changed from Walter Matthau into Cary
Grant, but I doubt it.

110
00:08:44,656 --> 00:08:46,558
It's a beard, it's not a cocoon.

111
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,362
You're not a butterfly now.

112
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:52,130
You're just an old caterpillar.

113
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:59,938
As time has gone by, the part of your face
is under that beard has become a lost world

114
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:05,644
sags, bags, crags, wrinkles, crinkles,
waddles and warts.

115
00:09:06,878 --> 00:09:10,882
Much better for you and your wife to
remember you the way you were then, rather

116
00:09:10,882 --> 00:09:12,784
than to see the way you are now.

117
00:09:13,985 --> 00:09:18,823
It's like watching an old TV series on cable
and then catching the reunion show and seeing

118
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:20,959
how rough the old actors look today.

119
00:09:21,893 --> 00:09:26,631
It's bad enough to watch that on TV, you
don't want to see it in your own mirror, so

120
00:09:26,631 --> 00:09:28,900
toss that razor back into the drawer.

121
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,569
You're way too old to survive a close shave.

122
00:09:32,704 --> 00:09:34,239
Remember, I'm pulling for you.

123
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:35,640
We're all in this together.

124
00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:45,150
How do you guys feel about the way leading
men are presented in today's movies?

125
00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:48,486
Well, I haven't seen any of them, but I'm
sure they're all crap.

126
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:50,955
Well, there's a problem there.

127
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:55,326
You know, women get one look at these
Hollywood fancy boys and all of a sudden,

128
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,762
their own husbands and somehow lacking.

129
00:09:58,663 --> 00:10:00,031
I agree with that.

130
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:06,404
You know, guys like Brad Pitt and Leonardo
DiCaprio make it very hard for middle age

131
00:10:06,404 --> 00:10:09,474
career criminals to get that all important
second date.

132
00:10:12,877 --> 00:10:18,149
You know, I've been wondering a lot lately if
Anne-Marie still finds me attractive.

133
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:19,684
Well, that's crazy talk.

134
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:22,353
She never found you attractive.

135
00:10:23,888 --> 00:10:24,956
I'm serious,

136
00:10:27,058 --> 00:10:28,826
I got into bed last night, it was feeling
amorous.

137
00:10:30,128 --> 00:10:31,563
She completely ignored me.

138
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,265
Well, that might help if you slept in the
same room.

139
00:10:37,468 --> 00:10:39,370
You know, maybe we should work on our
appearances.

140
00:10:40,405 --> 00:10:41,472
What if we worked out?

141
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,146
I tried the Stairmaster once they were, you
know, started it for half an hour.

142
00:10:52,016 --> 00:10:54,252
You don't want the whole. We're missing a big
detail here.

143
00:10:54,252 --> 00:10:56,087
See the leading Hollywood man.

144
00:10:56,087 --> 00:10:58,890
You know who they hang out with the leading
Hollywood women.

145
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:02,860
They're not cruising up here to possibly to
try to steal our wives.

146
00:11:03,494 --> 00:11:05,630
Yeah. You know what it's like.

147
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,698
It's like my business.

148
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:10,835
I might not have the best store in the
country, but I got the best store in Possum

149
00:11:10,835 --> 00:11:11,235
Lake.

150
00:11:12,503 --> 00:11:14,772
You got the only. Let's not nitpick Mike.

151
00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:17,842
Like, OK, but that's a good point here.

152
00:11:18,076 --> 00:11:23,114
See, the easiest way to be the best man in a
woman's life is to be the only man in their

153
00:11:23,114 --> 00:11:24,215
life. Exactly.

154
00:11:24,348 --> 00:11:25,116
Exactly.

155
00:11:26,818 --> 00:11:34,625
Ok, here's the deal I need to be the only man
in Anne-Marie's life, so I want you to to

156
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:38,429
promise. But you won't steal Ann Marie away
from me.

157
00:11:40,765 --> 00:11:41,866
You got my word on that one.

158
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:51,375
I have a way to catch a mailbox vandal.

159
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:53,478
You know what, these are iron filings.

160
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:53,911
What?

161
00:11:56,714 --> 00:11:57,882
You've been grinding your teeth.

162
00:11:59,517 --> 00:12:03,287
Iron filings, I put them inside the mailbox,
right, and then whoever smashes it, all I got

163
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:05,556
to do is take my handy dandy metal detector
here, right?

164
00:12:05,723 --> 00:12:06,123
Then I guess

165
00:12:06,891 --> 00:12:08,059
We're trying to catch a criminal.

166
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:11,028
Ok, if I want a science lesson, I'll clean
out the fridge.

167
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,432
Well, we just can't keep buying new
mailboxes.

168
00:12:15,499 --> 00:12:17,868
I know, you know, Dalton's store is almost
sold out of them.

169
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:19,537
That's why I made this baby.

170
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,372
Grab that baseball bat. I want to show you
something.

171
00:12:21,872 --> 00:12:23,407
Ok. Yeah.

172
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:26,110
Get that over here and just pretend you're
the vandal.

173
00:12:26,143 --> 00:12:27,345
Smash my new mailbox, huh?

174
00:12:28,045 --> 00:12:30,548
But what if it goes flying off and smashes
something beautiful like?

175
00:12:35,686 --> 00:12:37,655
Just. Ok.

176
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,699
Harold Samat.

177
00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:53,270
Yeah, so it's the mailbox.

178
00:12:58,042 --> 00:13:02,847
Well, the plan was we're going to have a
little fishing trip in a canoe, and Winston

179
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,882
loves to fish more than he loves to help.

180
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:06,784
So he just goes out at the end of the night.

181
00:13:06,784 --> 00:13:10,755
We get all the stuff there and I had the
cooler and then Walter kind of show off the

182
00:13:10,755 --> 00:13:15,259
way he does the launch. A canoe be more
brown than brainy, forgot to actually put a

183
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:22,133
rope on the canoe. So, you know, I have
really just the one question.

184
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:23,801
What were you thinking?

185
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:28,639
So I got the anchor rope there and I figure
if I could maybe just hook into that thing, I

186
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,075
say it's a it's a metal canoe shouldn't be.

187
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:33,010
It shouldn't be a problem. That's a nice
shot.

188
00:13:33,244 --> 00:13:34,245
And then just start pulling her in.

189
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:37,014
But there is a kind of a sandbar there, and
it had some foliage on it.

190
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:39,416
Next thing you know, the canoe is all wedged
on there.

191
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:42,686
Real good and ask, Do you mind Winston, do
you mind?

192
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,156
I hate to interrupt your fishing, but you
could just help us.

193
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:48,759
Well, then you know, it's whenever you get
two or more men doing something.

194
00:13:49,693 --> 00:13:54,398
A lot of them are helping, but there's
always going to be one guy who, how can I put

195
00:13:54,398 --> 00:13:56,300
this? Well, he's faking it, really.

196
00:14:01,038 --> 00:14:04,808
So I figure I'll switch from manpower to
horsepower, hook up to the possam van, and I

197
00:14:04,808 --> 00:14:08,412
was just going to just haul her away there,
but I thought if the guys could get some

198
00:14:08,412 --> 00:14:11,348
waves going, so I'm saying to them, you
know, jump up and down to the floating dock,

199
00:14:11,749 --> 00:14:14,151
jump up and down, just get a few ripples,
something going on.

200
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:15,519
There we go. That's that's it.

201
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,523
That's the idea. And it was about three 18
eight a.m.

202
00:14:19,523 --> 00:14:24,595
Got a lot of jam. So I probably was a little
over aggressive and then a lot of loose rocks

203
00:14:24,595 --> 00:14:26,063
and stones and what have you and.

204
00:14:30,534 --> 00:14:31,502
But we got our way.

205
00:14:33,304 --> 00:14:34,405
And I watch your hand.

206
00:14:37,975 --> 00:14:42,446
Ok, so I figure I could see Walter swimming
over to the dock, and I wasn't quite sure

207
00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:47,985
where Winston was and I got water up there,
but we so far, we got no Winston, we got no

208
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:51,722
canoe. But he pointed out that Winston was
fishing.

209
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:07,071
The experts portion of the show, this is
where we examine those three little words

210
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:08,839
that men find so hard to say.

211
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,443
Well, it's still true in that.

212
00:15:13,777 --> 00:15:17,548
Ok. Today's letter goes as follows Dear
Experts.

213
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:24,488
La La last night I dreamt I was driving my
car up a steep hill when the engine died and

214
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:28,792
it started to roll backwards faster and
faster until I woke up in a cold sweat.

215
00:15:29,092 --> 00:15:30,294
What does this mean?

216
00:15:31,695 --> 00:15:32,963
Well, it sounds like he popped the clutch too
fast.

217
00:15:35,432 --> 00:15:38,836
No, no, actually, I think this man wants us
to help interpret what the hidden meaning of

218
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:42,506
his dream. You're going to need to go into
the world of the unconscious mind.

219
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,309
You're going to need to come out of it.

220
00:15:49,146 --> 00:15:52,049
No, I think this dream is all about anxiety.

221
00:15:53,684 --> 00:15:55,018
Oh, OK. Ok, OK, I get it.

222
00:15:55,018 --> 00:15:56,119
This guy is afraid of hills.

223
00:15:57,721 --> 00:16:00,324
No, no, wait, wait, no. This guy has a fear
of failure.

224
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:02,025
That's why you can't climb the hill.

225
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:03,527
He's afraid if he stops, he'll slide
backwards.

226
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:06,897
And you also have to keep moving forward and
moving on.

227
00:16:07,798 --> 00:16:09,900
Well, if he's afraid of hills, he should move
to Saskatchewan.

228
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:18,742
I had this really weird dream once, and I was
I was in my jail cell, right?

229
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:22,245
And and there was this dwarf in the corner.

230
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:25,382
He was singing that Folsom Prison Blues.

231
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:29,720
And my mother was sitting in the shower next
to mine.

232
00:16:31,154 --> 00:16:32,990
That is so spooky.

233
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,959
I haven't got to the part where I fell
asleep yet.

234
00:16:38,662 --> 00:16:40,430
You know what, I think I think it's

235
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:43,433
Important, thanks. Do you know what else is
quite good?

236
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,603
What else is got those dreams where where
you can fly?

237
00:16:47,471 --> 00:16:52,442
Good. I have super powers allow me to do
things that I can't do in real life.

238
00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:55,145
Well, you know how getting a date is not
technically a super.

239
00:16:57,714 --> 00:17:00,317
And what kind of games do you have, Mr.

240
00:17:00,317 --> 00:17:02,285
Green? Oh, I don't have dreams.

241
00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:03,720
You don't dream.

242
00:17:04,287 --> 00:17:07,657
Well, no, because I mean, it sounds like if
you have to, if you want to have dreams, it

243
00:17:07,657 --> 00:17:11,461
must be because you're afraid of something
or you want something you can't have.

244
00:17:11,495 --> 00:17:11,895
So.

245
00:17:12,496 --> 00:17:14,197
Wow, that's really enlightened, Uncle Ralph.

246
00:17:14,231 --> 00:17:17,868
You know, it takes a lot of character to be
happy with where you are and what you have.

247
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,303
Why? Especially considering your
circumstances.

248
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:24,241
You really know what almost makes me think.

249
00:17:24,341 --> 00:17:26,409
Maybe I should just hang around here with
you forever.

250
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:26,943
Oh, no,

251
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:29,779
I didn't say I don't have nightmares.

252
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,323
Ever notice how when a man makes his bed,
his wife will usually come back in and make

253
00:17:40,323 --> 00:17:42,025
the whole darn thing all over again?

254
00:17:42,859 --> 00:17:47,197
I've seen Bernice come back in here and tuck
this thing in tighter than Joan Rivers face.

255
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:52,969
So it's not really worth it for a man to put
a lot of effort into making the bed and when

256
00:17:52,969 --> 00:17:54,571
it comes to the business of not making an
effort.

257
00:17:55,472 --> 00:17:57,507
I'm the president and CEO.

258
00:17:58,475 --> 00:18:04,214
What we have here is a bed that makes itself
see the string got this attached to all four

259
00:18:04,214 --> 00:18:05,649
corners in my bed close.

260
00:18:05,882 --> 00:18:09,152
And then they run down through these
eyeballs that are attached to all four

261
00:18:09,152 --> 00:18:10,287
corners of the bed.

262
00:18:10,887 --> 00:18:12,389
And they all meet up here.

263
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:14,324
This is one of these retractable dog
leashes.

264
00:18:15,325 --> 00:18:19,029
So at Night Knight let her out a few feet so
that Bernice and I have enough lead to roam

265
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:23,500
around a little. And then in the morning, I
just pressed the button.

266
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,601
He'll.

267
00:18:35,278 --> 00:18:37,213
Mailbox still a little too heavy for me.

268
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:43,319
I figure as the cement cures, it'll get
later Uncle Red.

269
00:18:43,353 --> 00:18:44,554
We just got a phone call from Junior
Singleton.

270
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:47,257
They think they caught the guy who's been
smashing the mailboxes.

271
00:18:49,826 --> 00:18:52,262
Mike and Dalton are bringing them over right
now so I can scan them.

272
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:57,300
You know, Harold, I don't understand what
you're saying, and I wish I cared.

273
00:18:57,367 --> 00:18:57,667
You know,

274
00:18:58,368 --> 00:18:59,969
The iron filings that put him in Junior's
mailbox.

275
00:19:00,503 --> 00:19:05,642
So whoever smashes covered in the filings,
no filings that can be picked up by this

276
00:19:05,642 --> 00:19:06,776
metal detector.

277
00:19:06,843 --> 00:19:09,279
Oh gee, it works just like this.

278
00:19:13,817 --> 00:19:17,253
The can that's the Cannes, we got it, Mr.

279
00:19:17,253 --> 00:19:22,926
Green, who he's hanging around downtown,
outside the recreation center, and he was

280
00:19:22,926 --> 00:19:24,627
carrying a baseball bat.

281
00:19:24,994 --> 00:19:26,629
Well, that's good enough for me right there.

282
00:19:26,663 --> 00:19:27,330
Oh, no, no, no, no,

283
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,898
No, no. We need more proof than that.

284
00:19:28,898 --> 00:19:30,767
I got to scan them for

285
00:19:36,873 --> 00:19:38,408
Maybe the metal detector is not working here.

286
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:48,318
Oh yeah. All right, meeting

287
00:19:48,318 --> 00:19:50,320
time. Well, what do we do now?

288
00:19:50,787 --> 00:19:53,823
Well, you guys might as well go to the
meeting and the young fella here is obviously

289
00:19:53,823 --> 00:19:55,992
not the bad guy. You can either stay or go
whatever you want.

290
00:19:56,225 --> 00:19:57,393
I should go.

291
00:19:57,427 --> 00:19:58,328
I'm on deck.

292
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,367
Dalton, hang on, man, there we.

293
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:07,070
Yeah, sure. What is it that's curious about
something?

294
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,179
Pretty good year for mailbox sales.

295
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:25,421
All right, man, has to make a living, you
know, and you know, I was kind of hoping we

296
00:20:25,421 --> 00:20:27,190
could keep this our little secret, you know?

297
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,627
Well, what say you pay everybody's lounge
dues for this year?

298
00:20:31,894 --> 00:20:32,829
We'll let it go at that.

299
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:34,530
Well, everybody's lunch dues.

300
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,565
That's not fair.

301
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:37,366
Man's got to make a living Dalton.

302
00:20:38,601 --> 00:20:42,271
Right. I'll see you at the meeting.

303
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,510
If my wife is watching, I'll be coming
straight home after the meet, and I'm hoping

304
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,278
to put the mail back in mail, man.

305
00:20:51,914 --> 00:20:53,683
Might even have a package just for you.

306
00:20:55,618 --> 00:20:59,655
Rasha, thanks for watching on behalf of
myself and Harold and the whole gang up here

307
00:20:59,655 --> 00:21:01,657
in Paris Plage, keep your stick on ice.

308
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:08,397
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

309
00:21:09,765 --> 00:21:10,299
All right.

310
00:21:15,838 --> 00:21:25,147
Now. By your heads from a man's prayer, I'm a
man that I can change if I have to.

311
00:21:25,615 --> 00:21:29,252
I yes, yes. All right, man, and I have some
good news.

312
00:21:29,652 --> 00:21:33,890
Dalton Humphrey has offered to cover
everybody's dues for the whole year.

313
00:21:36,726 --> 00:21:40,563
That would probably mean more if any of you
were actually planning on paying your dues.
