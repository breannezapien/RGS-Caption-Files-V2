YOU NORMALLY WEAR.

ACTUALLY, BETTER MAKE IT
TWO SIZES BIGGER.

ONE SIZE BIGGER IS PROBABLY
WHAT YOU SHOULD BE WEARING NOW.

21

NEXT, YOU TURN YOUR
GOOD PANTS INSIDE OUT,

INSIDE THE OVERSIZED JEANS.

00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:23,508
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT JUST
COMES DOWN TO THE PERSON.

156
00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:27,112
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE
HAD SUCCESS WITH A
LOT OF EDUCATION.

157
00:07:27,112 --> 00:07:29,081
BUT ME, I NEVER
HAD MUCH,

158
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:30,949
BUT HEY, I'VE HAD
A HAPPY LIFE,

159
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:32,417
A FAIR BIT OF SUCCESS,

160
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:34,252
A LITTLE BIT OF WEALTH ON ME
THERE, SOME SELF-ESTEEM,

161
00:07:34,252 --> 00:07:35,487
AND THE RESPECT
OF MY FRIENDS.

162
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:36,688
YOU HAVE?

163
00:07:36,688 --> 00:07:38,356
AND THEN YOU
LOST IT ALL?

164
00:07:38,356 --> 00:07:40,625
BOY, YOU MUST
BE BITTER.

165
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,895
[ APPLAUSE ]

166
00:08:06,284 --> 00:08:08,453
YOU KNOW, IN MY LIFE
I'VE EXPERIENCED

167
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:10,589
THERE ARE 10 THINGS
THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE.

168
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:12,724
THE FIRST ONE IS
BACKING UP A BOAT TRAILER.

169
00:08:12,724 --> 00:08:15,527
THE OTHER NINE
ALL INVOLVE MY WIFE.

170
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:17,496
SEE, THE PROBLEM
WITH THE BOAT TRAILER IS,

171
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:19,197
YOU'VE GOT TWO
SEPARATE VEHICLES

172
00:08:19,197 --> 00:08:22,033
A FLEXIBLE
BALL HITCH IN BETWEEN.

173
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:24,236
PLUS, YOU'RE DRIVING
USING YOUR MIRRORS

174
00:08:24,236 --> 00:08:25,837
OR ACTUALLY TURNING
YOUR HEAD AROUND,

175
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:28,106
IF YOU'RE UNDER 25.

176
00:08:28,106 --> 00:08:30,742
AND THE CAR IS PUSHING,
RATHER THAN PULLING.

177
00:08:30,742 --> 00:08:34,179
SO WHEN YOU TURN ONE WAY,
THE BOAT GOES THE OTHER.

178
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,653
IT'S ACTUALLY A LOT LIKE
THE PROBLEMS I HAD WHEN
I WAS DATING.

179
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:44,456
I ALWAYS GOT THE OPPOSITE
REACTION FROM THE ONE
I EXPECTED,

180
00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:48,293
AND I WAS TRYING TO CONTROL
THE SITUATION FROM
THE WRONG END.

181
00:08:48,293 --> 00:08:50,662
THE SOLUTION,
OF COURSE, IS MARRIAGE.

182
00:08:50,662 --> 00:08:53,064
WE'VE GOTTA MARRY THE
TWO VEHICLES INTO ONE.

183
00:08:53,064 --> 00:08:55,667
UNITED WE STAND;
DIVIDED WE JACK-KNIFE.

184
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:06,211
FIRST THING YOU WANNA DO
IS CUT OFF A PART OF THE CAR

185
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:08,246
THAT YOU DON'T
USE ANYMORE.

186
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:11,950
SADLY, AT MY AGE,
THAT'S THE BACK SEAT.

187
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,686
I MOUNTED A BUNCH OF CHISELS
TO THE EDGE OF THE
GARAGE DOOR,

188
00:09:14,686 --> 00:09:18,123
AND A COUPLE OF HEAVY ANCHORS
ADD A LITTLE JAM TO IT.

189
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:20,625
THEY'RE ACTUALLY WOOD CHISELS,
BUT THERE'S LOTS OF 'EM.

190
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,627
ANCHORS AWAY.

191
00:09:34,506 --> 00:09:36,207
OKAY, THAT'S THE
HARD PART DONE,

192
00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:38,410
WHICH WAS CUTTING THE CAR IN
HALF WITH THE GARAGE DOOR

193
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,345
AND THEN GETTIN'
THE MESS ALL CLEANED UP

194
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:44,048
BEFORE THOSE
PEOPLE CAME HOME.

195
00:09:45,216 --> 00:09:47,252
NOW WE'RE READY TO JOIN THE
FRONT HALF OF THE CAR

196
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:50,188
TO THIS BOAT TRAILER
IN HOLY MATRIMONY.

197
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:53,091
WHAT THIS MAN HAS
BROUGHT TOGETHER,

198
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:56,294
LET NO BOAT RAMP
REND ASUNDER, AMEN.

199
00:09:58,163 --> 00:10:00,165
OKAY, I SHOULD'VE
MENTIONED THIS EARLIER,

200
00:10:00,165 --> 00:10:02,834
GET A CAR THAT'S
FRONT-WHEEL DRIVE.

201
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:06,104
OTHERWISE WHEN YOU ATTACH THE
BOAT TRAILER TO THE DRIVE SHAFT,

202
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:10,241
SHE'LL GET SPINNING
AROUND LIKE A WHIRLIGIG...

203
00:10:11,609 --> 00:10:12,944
NO.

204
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:15,647
NO.

205
00:10:17,081 --> 00:10:18,816
AND IT'S JUST THAT EASY.

206
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:20,618
NO MORE JACK-KNIFES,

207
00:10:20,618 --> 00:10:23,454
NO MORE HAVING THE BOAT
TRAILER UNHITCH AT 50 KLIKS

208
00:10:23,454 --> 00:10:25,823
AND TAKING OUT
A BUS SHELTER.

209
00:10:25,823 --> 00:10:28,560
AND MOST OF ALL,
NO EMBARRASSMENT FOR ME.

210
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:05,163
[ APPLAUSE ]

211
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:19,177
I WANNA TALK TO YOU
OLDER FELLAS ABOUT
YOUR EATING HABITS.

212
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:22,413
SO MANY OF YOU ARE JUMPING ON
THIS LOW-CARB BANDWAGON

213
00:11:22,413 --> 00:11:25,049
I'M AFRAID SHE'S
GONNA BLOW A TIRE.

214
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:26,584
OKAY,
HERE'S THE THING...

215
00:11:26,584 --> 00:11:28,052
IT'S NOT ABOUT
COUNTING CARBS;

216
00:11:28,052 --> 00:11:30,221
IT'S NOT EVEN ABOUT
COUNTING CALORIES.

217
00:11:30,221 --> 00:11:33,057
IT'S ABOUT COUNTING MEALS.

218
00:11:33,057 --> 00:11:35,226
GOT A LITTLE SHOCK FOR YOU.

219
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:38,863
ACCORDING TO THE EXPERTS,
THERE ARE ONLY THREE OF 'EM...

220
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:42,033
BREAKFAST, LUNCH, DINNER.

221
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:43,868
NOW, YOU MAY
CALL "DINNER" "SUPPER,"

222
00:11:43,868 --> 00:11:47,872
AND THAT'S FINE,
BUT IT'S AN EITHER/OR DEAL.

223
00:11:47,872 --> 00:11:50,308
AND BRUNCH IS A REPLACEMENT
FOR BREAKFAST AND LUNCH.

224
00:11:50,308 --> 00:11:53,644
NOT A TIDE ME OVER
BETWEEN THE TWO.

225
00:11:53,644 --> 00:11:57,148
LIKEWISE, WE GOTTA STOP
INVENTING WHOLE NEW
MEALS OF OUR OWN.

226
00:11:57,148 --> 00:12:00,318
MEALS LIKE "BREAKCARFAST."

227
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:03,321
THAT'S THAT SECOND
BREAKFAST YOU EAT IN THE CAR.

228
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:04,922
THEN THERE'S "LUNSNACKER,"

229
00:12:04,922 --> 00:12:06,791
THE POST-LUNCH,
PRE-AFTERNOON SNACK

230
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,359
THAT GETS US
THROUGH TO DINSNACKER,

231
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:10,261
THEN THE SNACK FOR
WATCHING CABLE TV,

232
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:14,298
WHICH WE CALL "DIRECT FEED."

233
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:18,069
NOW, I KNOW CUTTING OUT ALL
THESE MEALS IS GOING TO
BE AN ADJUSTMENT.

234
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:20,471
BUT NO ONE WILL MIND IF
YOU DO A LITTLE COMPLAINING.

235
00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:22,440
HECK, IT'LL PROBABLY
BE THE FIRST TIME

236
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,443
THEY'VE HEARD YOU TALK WITH
YOUR MOUTH EMPTY IN YEARS!

REMEMBER,
I'M PULLIN' FOR YOU.

238
00:12:27,111 --> 00:12:29,213

THIS TOGETHER.

00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:37,321

TO WEAR --

244
00:12:42,393 --> 00:12:45,096
WHAT ARE YOU CHOPPING
WOOD IN THE LODGE
FOR ANYWAY?

245
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:46,864
WELL, YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T
LIKE MY HORSIE RIDE,

246
00:12:46,864 --> 00:12:48,833
SO I DECIDED
TO CARVE A STATUE.

247
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,969
YOU KNOW, A FACE THAT'S
HEROIC AND YET IT'S EVERYMAN,

248
00:12:51,969 --> 00:12:54,872
IT'S INSPIRING,
BUT NOT INTIMIDATING.

249
00:12:54,872 --> 00:12:56,574
HANDSOME,
YET INTELLIGENT.

250
00:13:00,077 --> 00:13:01,746
LOOKS LIKE YOU.

251
00:13:01,746 --> 00:13:03,481
Dalton: HEY, RED!
HOW'S THE STATUE COMING?

252
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:05,282
OH, PRETTY GOOD.

253
00:13:05,282 --> 00:13:07,218
LOOKS LIKE YOU...

254
00:13:07,218 --> 00:13:09,854
BUT KNOTTIER.

255
00:13:09,854 --> 00:13:11,522
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
HAROLD SAYS,

256
00:13:11,522 --> 00:13:13,124
BUT I DON'T SEE IT.

257
00:13:13,124 --> 00:13:14,859
WELL, THAT IS
NOT GOING TO DO.

258
00:13:14,859 --> 00:13:16,527
I MEAN, WE ALSO NEED
A STATUE OF A MAN

259
00:13:16,527 --> 00:13:18,262
THAT EXEMPLIFIES
THE POSSUM LAKE AREA.

260
00:13:18,262 --> 00:13:20,364
UH-UH-UH-UH!

261
00:13:20,364 --> 00:13:23,334
IT SHOULDN'T JUST
AUTOMATICALLY BE
A MAN, YOU KNOW.

262
00:13:23,334 --> 00:13:25,369
IT SHOULD BE AN
ARTISTIC STATEMENT.

263
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:28,572
SOMETHING THAT MAKES PEOPLE,
STOP, PAUSE, WONDER,

264
00:13:28,572 --> 00:13:30,207
MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER
ABOUT THEMSELVES.

265
00:13:30,207 --> 00:13:33,511
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING THAT
HAS NO SPECIFIC SEXUAL
GENDER AT ALL.

266
00:13:33,511 --> 00:13:36,313
OH, SO WE SHOULD MAKE A
STATUE THAT LOOKS LIKE YOU.

Red: YOU KNOW, THERE'S
NOTHING MORE RELAXING

268
00:13:43,487 --> 00:13:45,923
FOR A GUY,
OR EVEN A HAROLD,

269
00:13:45,923 --> 00:13:48,292
THAN TO GO OUT
INTO THE WOODS

270
00:13:48,292 --> 00:13:50,094
AND GET BACK TO NATURE

271
00:13:50,094 --> 00:13:52,663
INTO A MORE
SIMPLE EXISTENCE.

272
00:13:52,663 --> 00:13:56,734
CAN'T THINK OF THREE
BETTER GUYS TO GET SIMPLE

273
00:13:56,734 --> 00:13:58,869
THAN WALTER,
BILL AND HAROLD.

274
00:13:58,869 --> 00:14:02,106
AND THEY GOT THE HAMMOCKS.

275
00:14:02,106 --> 00:14:05,676
OKAY, YOU'RE MISSING SOME
BASIC CONCEPT HERE, BILL.

276
00:14:05,676 --> 00:14:07,444
I'M SURE IT'LL
WORK OUT IN THE END.

277
00:14:07,444 --> 00:14:09,179
THEY ENDED UP WITH FOUR TREES

278
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:12,116
FAIRLY CLOSE TOGETHER
THAT THEY COULD -- OH!

279
00:14:12,116 --> 00:14:14,952
UH, CLOSER THAN HAROLD
THOUGHT, APPARENTLY.

280
00:14:14,952 --> 00:14:16,654
WALTER'S GOT
A LITTLE MORE SENSE.

281
00:14:16,654 --> 00:14:18,889
HE JUST TIED HIS
HAND TO THE TREE.

282
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:20,491
BUT BILL FINALLY
GETS HIMSELF IN BUSINESS.

283
00:14:20,491 --> 00:14:23,527
ONE THING ABOUT BILL,
HE CAN FALL ASLEEP ANYWHERE.

284
00:14:23,527 --> 00:14:26,497
LUCKILY,
HE HAS CRUISE CONTROL.

285
00:14:26,497 --> 00:14:30,567
AND HAROLD'S TYING HIS
HAMMOCK TO THE SAME
TREE, OF COURSE.

286
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:32,469
AND HE TIED
A REAL GOOD KNOT.

287
00:14:32,469 --> 00:14:34,605
HE SAW BILL'S KNOT,
HE THOUGHT THAT DIDN'T
LOOK QUITE RIGHT.

288
00:14:34,605 --> 00:14:39,176
HE KIND OF GAVE IT A TUG.
IT'S A SLIP KNOT.

289
00:14:39,176 --> 00:14:41,812
BUT, UH, BILL
HAD NO IDEA --

290
00:14:41,812 --> 00:14:45,949
AND WALTER HAD --
IT WOULDN'T QUITE REACH,

291
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:48,585
SO HE HAD TO REALLY
HORSE HER OVER THERE.

292
00:14:49,987 --> 00:14:52,389
'COURSE WHAT YOU'RE DOIN' IS
CREATING A LOT OF TENSION,

293
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:54,792
WHICH IS WHAT
HAROLD USUALLY DOES.

294
00:14:55,893 --> 00:14:58,495
THESE HAMMOCKS ARE NOW
STRETCHED PRETTY TIGHT.

295
00:14:58,495 --> 00:15:00,531
SO HE'S BACK IN BUSINESS.

296
00:15:00,531 --> 00:15:02,166
SO BILL, WHY DON'T
YOU JUST --

297
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,400
SEE IF YOU CAN
GO BACK TO SLEEP.

298
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,701
THERE YOU GO.

299
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:07,805
AND HAROLD HAS HIS
REALLY TOO LOOSE HERE.

300
00:15:07,805 --> 00:15:10,908
IT'S MORE OF A SLIP --
DOWN, YEAH.

301
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:16,814
SO HAROLD REALISES NOW --
TAKE HIS HATCHET

302
00:15:16,814 --> 00:15:18,982
AND CUT LITTLE
NOTCHES IN THE TREE.

303
00:15:18,982 --> 00:15:21,718
AND, UH,
WALTER'S DOIN' FINE.

304
00:15:21,718 --> 00:15:26,690
IN MEXICO, I BELIEVE,
THESE ARE CALLED
BOWLESS NOTCHES.

305
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:30,928
AND HE PUTS THE HAMMOCK
ROPE RIGHT THROUGH THOSE.

306
00:15:30,928 --> 00:15:32,329
NOW YOU'RE IN GOOD SHAPE.

307
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:34,631
NOW SAME THING
AT THE OTHER END.

308
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:36,233
AND, UH, HE'S MAKIN'
THE NOTCHES,

309
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:38,836
UNFORTUNATELY -- OH.

310
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:43,440
BUT HAROLD IS
OBLIVIOUS AS USUAL.

311
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,877
AND HE GETS INTO THE HAMMOCK,
JUST GETS COMFORTABLE,

312
00:15:46,877 --> 00:15:50,714
AND THE NEXT
THING YOU KNOW...

313
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:55,452
A LITTLE TIT FOR TAT,
RIGHT, BILL?

314
00:15:55,452 --> 00:15:59,256
ANYWAY, FINALLY ALL THREE
ARE SETTLED IN, RELAXING,

315
00:15:59,256 --> 00:16:01,625
AND HAROLD STARTS TO GET
A LITTLE BIT HUNGRY.

316
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,527
AND HE GETS UP, WHICH
UPSETS THE WHOLE BALANCE

317
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:06,663
OF THE TENSION
BETWEEN THE HAMMOCKS.

318
00:16:06,663 --> 00:16:10,100
AND HE HAD PUT A SMALL BAG OF
POPCORN INTO HIS BACKPACK,

319
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,802
IT'S DOWN AT
THE BOTTOM, HAROLD.

320
00:16:11,802 --> 00:16:13,770
THERE YOU GO.

321
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:17,708
HAROLD EATS ENOUGH POPCORN
HE CAN ACTUALLY IMAGINE
THE MOVIE.

322
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,509
SO HE GOES BACK,
DOESN'T SEE THE HATCHET,

323
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:22,512
FALLS INTO THE HAMMOCK,
SPRINGS THE OTHER GUYS

324
00:16:22,512 --> 00:16:25,515
UP THROUGH THE --

325
00:16:25,515 --> 00:16:27,784
SO NOW HAROLD'S LYING
THERE KIND OF THINKING,

326
00:16:27,784 --> 00:16:29,386
I WONDER WHERE THE
OTHER TWO GUYS ARE.

327
00:16:29,386 --> 00:16:31,154
I'M SAYING TO HIM,
YOU KNOW,

328
00:16:31,154 --> 00:16:33,557
I'M THINKIN' THEY'LL
BE BACK IN A MINUTE.

329
00:16:38,962 --> 00:16:41,698
SO THEY DON'T REALLY
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

330
00:16:41,698 --> 00:16:47,270
HAROLD'S NOT THERE,
AND NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE.

331
00:16:49,106 --> 00:16:51,975
ROCKABYE, BABY,
ON THE TREETOP,

332
00:16:51,975 --> 00:16:54,144
WHEN THE WIND BLOWS,
YOU'RE STILL A DORK.

333
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:08,391
IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN MY
DAD AND I WOULD GO ON
A CANOE TRIP,

334
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:11,094
WE PACKED ALL OUR STUFF
INTO WICKER BASKETS.

335
00:17:11,094 --> 00:17:12,963
LET THE BUGS IN
AND THE SMELLS OUT

336
00:17:12,963 --> 00:17:15,232
AND THEY SUNK EVERY TIME
WE FLIPPED OVER,

337
00:17:15,232 --> 00:17:17,267
WHICH HAPPENED
ON A REGULAR BASIS.

338
00:17:17,267 --> 00:17:19,903
THEN DAD GOT A GREAT
BIG METAL COOLER.

339
00:17:19,903 --> 00:17:22,672
IT HAD SHARP EDGES AND RUSTED
FASTER THAN A STUDEBAKER

340
00:17:22,672 --> 00:17:24,875
AND WEIGHED MORE
THAN OUR FRIDGE.

341
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:28,478
I TELL YOU, THE GUY WHO THOUGHT
THAT A METAL BOX WOULD MAKE
A GREAT INSULATOR

342
00:17:28,478 --> 00:17:31,548
SHOULD'VE SPENT A WINTER
IN A GARDEN SHED.

343
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:33,850
BUT EVENTUALLY SCIENCE
GOT INTO THE ATOMIC AGE

344
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,720
AND PRODUCED A MIRACLE
SUBSTANCE...

345
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,256
POLY-WANNA-CRACKERLINE.

346
00:17:39,256 --> 00:17:41,625
FINALLY A COOLER
YOU COULD LIFT, HUH?

347
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,794
AND IT EVEN FLOATS --
UNLIKE DAD.

348
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:46,596
AND THESE THINGS
CLOSE OFF AIRTIGHT,

349
00:17:46,596 --> 00:17:48,999
WHICH IS GREAT WHEN YOU'RE
TAKING FOOD TO THE CAMPSITE,

350
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:51,801
OR BRINGING
DIRTY LAUNDRY HOME.

351
00:17:51,801 --> 00:17:56,606
NOW, THAT COOLER IN THE CANOE,
SURE, WAS A BIG STEP FORWARD,

352
00:17:56,606 --> 00:17:58,642
BUT WHY JUST
TAKE ONE STEP?

353
00:17:58,642 --> 00:18:02,078
IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH COOLERS AND
THE HANDYMAN'S SECRET WEAPON

354
00:18:02,078 --> 00:18:04,681
YOU CAN TAKE IT
TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL.
