00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:35,120
I GOTTA TAKE THE BOTTOM
OUT OF HER FIRST.

156
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:36,855
THERE'S A LUCKY BREAK.

157
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:39,524
THE BOTTOM'S ALREADY
RUSTED OUT OF THIS UNIT.

158
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:42,494
TOXIC WASTE
CAN BE OUR FRIEND.

159
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:46,865
YOU KNOW, IF DUCT TAPE IS THE
HANDYMAN'S BEST FRIEND,

160
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:49,968
THEN THE BUNGEE CORD HAS
GOT TO BE HIS GOLFING BUDDY.

161
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:51,470
WE'LL USE A
COUPLE OF THEM HERE

162
00:07:51,536 --> 00:07:53,672
TO MAKE A SPRING-LOADED
TRAP DOOR ON THE SLIDE.

163
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:57,409
IT'S REALLY A STOPPER
FOR THE HOPPER ON MY CHOPPER.

164
00:07:58,543 --> 00:07:59,978
NOW ALL I GOT TO DO IS

165
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:02,114
GET THE SLIDE HIGH ENOUGH
AND AT THE RIGHT ANGLE

166
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:05,150
SO THAT THE BARS ON THE
CAROUSEL WILL HIT THE
HOCKEY STICK.

167
00:08:05,217 --> 00:08:06,685
OF COURSE,
YOU KNEW THAT.

168
00:08:11,957 --> 00:08:13,925
OKAY, THERE'S MY
HOPPER/FEEDER.

169
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,927
NOW WE NEED THE
CHOPPER/SPLITTER.

170
00:08:15,994 --> 00:08:17,295
AND FOR THAT ALL
I NEED TO DO

171
00:08:17,362 --> 00:08:19,898
IS TO MOUNT SOMETHING HEAVY ON
THE END OF THE TEETER-TOTTER

172
00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:23,335
AND THEN MOUNT THIS AXE UNDER
THE SEAT FACING DOWN LIKE THAT.

173
00:08:23,368 --> 00:08:24,803
THEN WHEN THE LOG COMES
ROUND ON THE CAROUSEL,

174
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,173
SHE'LL DROP DOWN AND
SPLIT HER RIGHT IN HALF.

175
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:30,775
I SUPPOSE I COULD
HAVE MOUNTED THIS UNIT
ON THERE INSTEAD OF AN AXE,

176
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:32,744
BUT THEN IT WOULDN'T BE
A TEETER-TOTTER, WOULD IT?

177
00:08:32,777 --> 00:08:35,080
IT WOULD BE A SEE-SAW.

178
00:08:36,781 --> 00:08:38,483
I'M USING A CAR
ENGINE AS MY WEIGHT.

179

AN OLD FLAT-HEAD FOUR
'CAUSE I'M SPLITTING
PINE AND BIRCH.

180
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:44,522
BUT IF YOU'RE WORKING IN OAK
OR ANY OF THE FRUIT WOODS,

181
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:48,226
YOU MIGHT WANT TO GO WITH
A BIG BLOCK HEMI OR A
DIESEL ON THAT.

182
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,363
YOU CAN SEE HOW THAT MUCH
WEIGHT IS GOING TO BRING
THE AXE DOWN

183
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:53,898
HARDER THAN A C.E.O.
AFTER A BOARD MEETING.

184
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:56,434
THE TRICK IS HOW DO I GET
THE AXE TO GO BACK UP?

185
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:58,670
OH, THERE WE GO.

186
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,739

PICNIC TABLE.

187

THEY MUST HAVE KNOWN WE
WERE GOING TO DO THIS
WHEN THEY BUILT IT.

189
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:10,515
OKAY, NOW, AS THE
CAROUSEL GOES AROUND,

190
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:12,817
THESE ARMS ARE GOING
TO LIFT UP THE TEETER-TOTTER,

191
00:09:12,884 --> 00:09:16,888
RAISE THE AXE UP INTO
POSITION TO COME DOWN
AND SPLIT THE NEXT LOG.

192
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:20,358
REMEMBER WHEN THIS CAROUSEL
WAS JUST A WASTE OF TIME
AND ENERGY?

193
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:21,826
OH, I KNOW.

194

THINKING, "WAIT A SEC, RED.

TO TURN ON THE CAROUSEL,

IN A HOUSE FULL OF TEENAGERS?

YOURSELF IN HARM'S WAY

THAT TAKES GUTS;
NOT MUCH GLORY.

TO SAY A FEW THOUSAND BUCKS.

00:14:48,318 --> 00:14:53,123
BETTER YET, RETURN SPOT
AND MAKE FRIENDS WITH
YOUR NEIGHBOUR'S DOG.

THAT WAY YOU STILL HAVE
A FRIEND TO PLAY FETCH WITH,

FEED IT OR WALK IT OR
CLEAN UP AFTER IT.

ADAM IS GOING TO BE TAKING
HIS NEW PUPPY BACK, DWIGHT.

OKAY, IF HE INSISTS
ON KEEPING THE DOG,

309
00:15:07,438 --> 00:15:10,474
THEN MY ADVICE IS TO PROP THE
DOOR OPEN WITH SOMETHING.

THAT WAY HE CAN COME
AND GO AS HE PLEASES.

DOGS'LL WALK THEMSELVES
IF YOU LET THEM.

312
00:15:16,947 --> 00:15:21,084
JUST REMEMBER TO
LEAVE HIS COLLAR OFF
SO NOBODY KNOWS HE'S YOURS.

HIS COLLAR OR TAGS

BACK DOWN TO THE POUND,
