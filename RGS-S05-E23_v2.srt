1
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:05,505
(Garbage cans clanking)

2
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:06,639
(Crashing and banging)

3
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,643
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

4
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,913
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO THE WISEST, KINDEST,

5
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:15,548
GENTLEST WOODSMAN
THERE EVER WAS,

6
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:19,352
BUT HE WAS EATEN BY A BEAR,
SO INSTEAD, HERE'S

7
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:21,387
MY UNCLE, RED GREEN!

8
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:22,489
(Applause)

9
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,790
(Cheering)

10
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,458
(Whistling)

11
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,627
(Applause)

12
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,896
(Whooping)

13
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,031
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

14
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,399
I'M HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE

15
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:34,701
WE HAD A BREAKTHROUGH

16
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:36,903
IN OUR ONGOING CASH CRUNCH.

17
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,938
WE HAVE DECIDED TO GROW

18
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:40,440
SOME OF OUR OWN FOOD.

19
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,741
GARDENING?

20
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:42,775
THAT'S EXCELLENT!

21
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,377
THAT'S WAY-- OH, THAT'S GREAT.

22
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,578
GARDENING SHOWS GET

23
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:46,546
WAY BETTER RATINGS

24
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:48,214
THAN HUNTING AND FISHING SHOWS,

25
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:49,649
OR WHATEVER THIS IS.

26
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,186
HAROLD, WE'RE NOT GONNA GARDEN.

27
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,254
MEN DON'T GARDEN.

28
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,321
MY WIFE GARDENS,
MY MOTHER GARDENS.

29
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:58,424
MEN DON'T GARDEN --
THEY FARM, ALL RIGHT?

30
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:02,929
IT'S THE SAME IDEA,
BUT YOU LOSE MORE MONEY.

31
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,465
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO SAVE MONEY.

32
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:06,799
WELL, WE WILL, HAROLD.

33
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,735
WE LISTED THE FOOD
WE SPEND THE MOST ON.

34
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:11,271
WE PICKED ONE WE'RE GONNA GROW.

35
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:12,939
SO, LIKE, FRUITS
OR VEGETABLES OR... ?

36
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,274
NO.

37
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,942
BEER NUTS.

38
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,543
(Audience laughing)

39
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,615
(Horns honking)

40
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:24,851
(Geese honking)

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,522
(Quacking)

42
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:35,928
(Red): RANGER GORD'S GONNA DO
A LITTLE STEP-DANCING FOR YOU.

43
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:39,932
EDGAR MONTROSE IS WORKING
TIRELESSLY, AS USUAL.

44
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,934
I'M GONNA DO A LITTLE
POWER-GARDENING

45
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,936
OUT BEHIND THE LODGE.

46
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:47,707
GOOD OLD GARTH HARBLE'S
GONNA GO OUT OF CONTROL.

47
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,514
I CANNOT BELIEVE BEER NUTS IS
THE NUMBER-ONE EXPENSE.

48
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,983
IT ISN'T, BUT WE DON'T KNOW
HOW TO GROW PIZZA.

49
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,387
HOW ABOUT SOMETHING
LIKE RADISHES OR GREEN BEANS,

50
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,556
SOMETHING THAT'S EASILY GROWN?

51
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,592
WE WANT TO GROW STUFF
THAT WE EAT, ALL RIGHT?

52
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,829
LAST YEAR, OUR WHOLE
VEGETABLE BUDGET WAS $7.00.

53
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,065
WE ENDED UP
WITH A $6.00 SURPLUS.

54
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:14,267
YOU CAN'T JUST PLANT ONE THING.

55
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:15,701
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE SOIL.

56
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:17,303
YOU GOTTA ROTATE YOUR CROPS.

57
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,338
IF THAT'S LIKE
SPINNING YOUR WHEELS,

58
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:20,807
I'M DOING THAT RIGHT NOW.

59
00:02:20,873 --> 00:02:23,209
SAY, FOR INSTANCE...
OK, SAY I TAKE A LEEK.

60
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,544
I'D RATHER YOU DIDN'T.

61
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,045
NO...

62
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:27,547
(Audience laughing)

63
00:02:27,613 --> 00:02:29,415
NO, I'M TALKING

64
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,983
ABOUT BEANS AND LEEKS
AND CUCUMBERS.

65
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,485
YOU GOTTA ROTATE

66
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,554
YOUR BEANS AND LEEKS
AND CUCUMBERS.

67
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,557
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
A CUCUMBER AND ROTATE IT?

68
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:40,560
(Audience laughing)

69
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:43,496
(Applause)

70
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:46,499
(Cheering and whistling)

71
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:50,536
AND THEY WONDER WHY THE YOUNG
PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THE FARM.

72
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:54,941
(Red): BILL'S GONNA BE CLEARING
LAND FOR OUR GARDEN.

73
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:57,910
HE'S GOT ONE OF THESE
CHIPPER-SHREDDER UNITS

74
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:00,179
THAT TAKES EVERYTHING
AND SHREDS AND CHIPS IT.

75
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,514
THAT'S HOW THEY GOT--

76
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:02,915
WELL, THE NAME IS

77
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,618
KIND OF SENSIBLE...
KIND OF A SENSIBLE THING.

78
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,520
I HADN'T NOTICED THAT HE WAS...

79
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,522
GOTTA GET THOSE BRAKES
CHECKED...

80
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,157
(Sputtering)

81
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,427
THIS IS EDGAR MONTROSE.

82
00:03:14,493 --> 00:03:18,898
YOU KNOW, TODAY'S EXPLOSIVES
ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER.

83
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:22,234
FOR EXAMPLE,
THERE'S A NEW KIND OF DYNAMITE

84
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:25,037
THAT CAN BLOW AN ENTIRE TREE
OVER...

85
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:27,039
498, 499...

86
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:28,541
500.

87
00:03:28,607 --> 00:03:31,043
... OVER 500 YARDS.

88
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,545
OOHHH!

89
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:34,046
(Coughing)

90
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,848
RED...

91
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,117
YOUR DAUGHTER
HAS JUST BROUGHT HOME

92
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:40,052
HER LATEST ROMANTIC CONQUEST.

93
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:43,989
ANOTHER FLOAT IN A PARADE
FULL OF LOSERS.

94
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:46,826
SHE'S JUST SAID THOSE SIX WORDS
YOU'VE BEEN DREADING

95
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:48,994
SINCE SHE STARTED DATING
THIS DOORKNOB.

96
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:52,498
"WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM?"

97
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,999
NOW, BE CAREFUL.

98
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:55,501
SHE IS YOUR WIFE'S DAUGHTER.

99
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,504
ONE FALSE WORD, SHE COULD
BLOW UP JUST LIKE HER MOTHER.

100
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,740
EVEN WORSE -- SHE'S YOUNGER.

101
00:04:00,806 --> 00:04:02,508
SHE'S GOT MORE ENERGY.

102
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,243
YOU KNOW THE GUY'S A DEADBEAT.

103
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,078
EVEN YOUR DOG DOESN'T LIKE HIM.

104
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,513
YOU CAN'T TELL HER THAT.

105
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,016
ALL RIGHT, SO, YOU HAVE TO LIE,
BIG TIME.

106
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,852
YOU SAY HE'S A FINE YOUNG MAN.

107
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:14,353
SAY HE'S OUTSTANDING.

108
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,021
RESPECTABLE.
REALLY NICE.

109
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:18,023
SAY YOU WANT TO SPEND
TIME WITH HIM.

110
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,692
SAY YOU WANT
TO TAKE HIM FISHING.

111
00:04:19,758 --> 00:04:21,193
OR... OR... OR...

112
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,529
SAY YOU WANT TO TAKE HIM
TO LODGE MEETINGS!

113
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,431
SHE'LL DROP HIM IN A FLASH.

114
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:28,534
SHE CAN'T STAND THE THOUGHT
OF TELLING PEOPLE

115
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,537
THAT SHE'S DATING
A FRIEND OF HER FATHER'S.

116
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,539
(Audience laughing)

117
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,907
(Applause and cheering)

118
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:36,408
(Strums acoustic guitar)

119
00:04:36,408 --> 00:04:38,410
OH, THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT A CAMP-FIRE

120
00:04:38,477 --> 00:04:40,279
THAT MAKES US ALL
FEEL WARM

121
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,947
NOT JUST ON THE OUTSIDE

122
00:04:42,014 --> 00:04:44,216
BUT IN MANY
OF OUR INTERNAL ORGANS

123
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:46,318
IT HELPS
TRUE FRIENDSHIPS FORM

124
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:48,787
OH, THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT A CAMP-FIRE

125
00:04:48,854 --> 00:04:50,956
THE SMOKE, THE SMELL
ARE SUBLIME

126
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:53,993
AND IT'S REALLY, REALLY
MANLY TO BURN UP A FOREST

127
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:55,494
ONE LOG AT A TIME

128
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:58,130
(Coughing)

129
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:00,432
THOUGHT I'D USE
"HANDYMAN CORNER"

130
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:04,403
TO DO A LITTLE FARMING FOR
ALL OF YOU WHO SEE THE SENSE

131
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,138
IN GROWING YOUR OWN BEER NUTS.

132
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,741
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
IS PICKING THE GROUND.

133
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:10,743
DON'T PLANT
WHERE PEOPLE PARK CARS,

134
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:13,012
ESPECIALLY IF THEY'VE GOT
LEAKY GASKETS.

135
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:15,047
DON'T PLANT 'EM
NEAR A FIRE HYDRANT.

136
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,416
THAT REALLY AFFECTS
THE TASTE OF THE NUTS.

137
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,018
THEY TASTE LIKE PISTACHIOS.

138
00:05:19,084 --> 00:05:20,552
THE DEAL WITH NUTS IS THAT

139
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:23,188
THE NUTS ARE THE SEEDS
OF THE NUT PLANTS,

140
00:05:23,255 --> 00:05:26,859
SO TO SEED THE NUT PLANTS,
YOU GOTTA PLANT THE NUT SEEDS,

141
00:05:26,925 --> 00:05:28,661
AND, OF COURSE, VICE VERSA.

142
00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:32,531
FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS
DIG A HOLE THREE INCHES DEEP.

143
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:36,035
JUST ROUND THAT OUT--

144
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:37,736
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S FINE.

145
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:41,540
YOU MAY NEED A SHOVEL
TO GIVE YOURSELF THE LEVERAGE.

146
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,542
NO SHAME IN THAT.

147
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:49,214
BOY, THIS IS TOUGH STUFF, HERE.

148
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:53,886
(Gasping and grunting)

149
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,488
(Sniffing)

150
00:05:56,555 --> 00:05:58,457
ALL RIGHT, AT THIS POINT,

151
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:02,461
A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD PICK
ANOTHER PIECE OF GROUND.

152
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,930
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE
AREN'T ME...

153
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:07,065
NOT THAT THAT BOTHERS THEM.

154
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:09,868
I FIGURE I'M A MAN
AND THIS IS DIRT.

155
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:12,504
DIRT DOES NOT TELL ME
WHERE TO GO.

156
00:06:12,571 --> 00:06:14,072
EVERYBODY ELSE DOES THAT.

157
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:16,708
IF I'VE GOT THE PLAN
TO PUT MY SEEDS HERE,

158
00:06:16,775 --> 00:06:19,578
IT'S UP TO THE SPOT HERE
TO ADAPT TO MY PLAN.

159
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:25,517
(Grunting)

160
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:27,986
(Drill squeaking)

161
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,092
OH!

162
00:06:39,264 --> 00:06:42,301
WHEN THE PIONEERS SETTLED
THIS GREAT COUNTRY,

163
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:44,469
THEY HAD TO OVERCOME OBSTACLES,

164
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:47,973
OBSTACLES LIKE FAMINE,
DROUGHT, HARD GROUND,

165
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,975
EXPENSIVE BEER NUTS.

166
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,044
DID THAT BOTHER THEM? NO, SIR.

167
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,446
THEY TRIED TO REASON
WITH THE PROBLEM,

168
00:06:54,513 --> 00:06:56,715
TRIED TO SOLVE IT
IN A PEACEFUL WAY,

169
00:06:56,782 --> 00:06:59,284
BUT EVENTUALLY,
WHEN PUSH CAME TO SHOVE,

170
00:06:59,351 --> 00:07:02,187
THEY'D TAKE THEIR BEER NUT
AND THEY'D SHOVE IT

171
00:07:02,254 --> 00:07:05,090
INTO THEIR CUSTOMIZED
B.B/BEER NUT PLANTER.

172
00:07:05,157 --> 00:07:08,493
JUST LOAD 'ER IN THERE...

173
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,995
FIRE 'ER UP...

174
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,998
AND LET NATURE TAKE ITS COURSE.

175
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:16,101
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

176
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:18,503
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

177
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,639
HEY, MAYBE THE PEOPLE NEXT DOOR

178
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,775
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE
A BEER NUT TREE OF THEIR OWN.

179
00:07:23,842 --> 00:07:25,510
THAT WOULD BE NEIGHBOURLY.

180
00:07:25,577 --> 00:07:27,012
HEY!

181
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,513
SORRY!

182
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,582
MUST BE VEGETARIANS.

183
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:34,586
WE GOT SOME PICTURES
TO SHOW YOU IN "MALE CALL".

184
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,359
OUR FIRST ATTEMPT
AT GROWING OUR FOOD

185
00:07:41,426 --> 00:07:42,894
WAS NOT A COMPLETE SUCCESS.

186
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:44,262
HAD ALL THE EQUIPMENT.

187
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:45,964
HAD THE ENGINES WAILING AWAY.

188
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:49,000
HAD A ROAD SALTER THERE
TO SPREAD OUT THE BEER NUTS.

189
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:51,903
WINSTON HAD HOOKED UP
HIS SEPTIC TANK TO A ZAMBONI.

190
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,139
THAT WAS GONNA GIVE US
THE FERTILIZER.

191
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:56,741
HAD A STREET CLEANER
FOR IRRIGATING THE FIELD

192
00:07:56,808 --> 00:08:00,445
BUT THE PRESSURE WAS SO STRONG,
IT WASHED THE WHOLE FIELD AWAY,

193
00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:02,347
RIGHT DOWN TO THE BARE ASPHALT.

194
00:08:02,414 --> 00:08:05,717
YOU CAN GET TOPSOIL AT GRACIE'S
GARDEN CENTRE AND VIDEO STORE.

195
00:08:05,784 --> 00:08:08,487
SURE YOU CAN,
BUT IT'S $30 A BUSHEL.

196
00:08:08,553 --> 00:08:10,989
BEER NUTS ARE ONLY
$25 A BUSHEL.

197
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:13,859
THIS IS NOT "ECONOMICALLY
VIABLE", ALL RIGHT?

198
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:15,560
YOU'RE GONNA
NEED TOPSOIL.

199
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:18,897
MAYBE IF EVERYBODY WIPED THEIR
BOOTS, YOU'D GET ENOUGH.

200
00:08:18,964 --> 00:08:22,801
NO, HAROLD, AFTER DARK,
WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE GOLF CLUB

201
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:25,303
WITH A SNOW-PLOUGH
AND A DUMP-TRUCK.

202
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,006
WE'RE GONNA PEEL BACK
ABOUT FIVE ACRES

203
00:08:28,073 --> 00:08:31,776
ON ONE OF THEM PAR FIVES,
TAKE OUT A FEW TONS OF DIRT

204
00:08:31,843 --> 00:08:34,112
AND JUST LAY 'ER
BACK DOWN AGAIN.

205
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:35,513
(Audience laughing)

206
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,983
I'VE HEARD OF REPLACING
YOUR DIVOT--

207
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:40,051
UNCLE RED, YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

208
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:41,386
NO HARM, THERE, HAROLD.

209
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:43,855
IT WILL STILL BE A PAR FIVE,
JUST A FOOT LOWER.

210
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:47,225
NOBODY WILL EVEN NOTICE ONCE WE
HAMMER THE CUP INTO THE GREEN.

211
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:49,227
YOU COULD ALWAYS MAKE
YOUR OWN TOPSOIL.

212
00:08:49,294 --> 00:08:51,029
YEAH, IT'S REAL EASY.

213
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:52,564
JUST GET A COMPOSTER.

214
00:08:52,631 --> 00:08:55,133
YOU TAKE FRUIT
AND VEGETABLE SCRAPS

215
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,636
AND SOME WORMS
AND BIPPETY-BOPPETY-BOOP,

216
00:08:57,702 --> 00:08:59,137
YOU GOT GRADE "A" LOAM.

217
00:08:59,204 --> 00:09:00,472
AND IT'S FREE.

218
00:09:00,538 --> 00:09:01,806
FREE, HAROLD?

219
00:09:01,873 --> 00:09:03,241
FREE.
FREE?

220
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:05,744
FREE -- "ECONOMICALLY VIABLE".

221
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,245
(Laughing)

222
00:09:07,312 --> 00:09:08,580
(Audience laughing)

223
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:11,416
TOO OFTEN, A PERSON
FORGETS ABOUT SAFETY,

224
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:14,753
AND FAR TOO OFTEN,
THAT PERSON IS BUZZ SHERWOOD.

225
00:09:14,819 --> 00:09:16,254
YO, RED GUY!

226
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:18,256
HAROLD, I OWE YOU A NUGGIE.

227
00:09:18,323 --> 00:09:19,758
COME HERE, HAROLD.

228
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:21,593
OH, COME ON, HAROLD.

229
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:24,062
MAN, A LITTLE DAB'LL DO YA.

230
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:27,766
SO, BUZZ, WHAT IS
THE SAFETY THEME TODAY?

231
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:30,268
I'M GOING FOR A LONG-DISTANCE
ENDURANCE FLIGHT,

232
00:09:30,335 --> 00:09:31,903
SO SAFETY IS CRITICAL.

233
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,772
KIND OF A LONG-DISTANCE
RECORD.

234
00:09:33,838 --> 00:09:35,440
I HOLD THE PROVINCIAL RECORD

235
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:37,409
FOR THE BIGGEST
MID-AIR EXPLOSION,

236
00:09:37,475 --> 00:09:39,778
AND MOST FLAMES
IN TAKE-OFF
 AND
 LANDING.

237
00:09:39,844 --> 00:09:43,782
YOU'RE THE ONLY PILOT
TO EVER LAND ON ONE PONTOON.

238
00:09:43,848 --> 00:09:45,116
WHEN DID I DO THAT?

239
00:09:45,183 --> 00:09:47,285
LAST YEAR, YOU BROUGHT 'ER DOWN
IN THE SEWER.

240
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:50,054
YEAH, BUT THIS STUNT,
I'M DOING ON PURPOSE.

241
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:52,924
OH! YOU CERTAINLY GOT
ENOUGH STUFF OUT HERE.

242
00:09:52,991 --> 00:09:54,359
I GOT EVERYTHING, MAN.

243
00:09:54,425 --> 00:09:56,294
I GOT THE LIFEJACKETS --
SAFETY FIRST.

244
00:09:56,361 --> 00:09:57,629
ABSOLUTELY.

245
00:09:57,695 --> 00:09:59,964
I GOT EXTRA FUEL,
AND CHECK THIS OUT.

246
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:01,299
HAVE YOU SEEN THESE?

247
00:10:01,366 --> 00:10:02,634
THEY'RE CALLED "MAPS".

248
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,968
YOU LOOK AT IT AND

249
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:07,005
IT'S LIKE A LITTLE PICTURE
OF WHERE YOU CAN GO.

250
00:10:07,071 --> 00:10:09,107
NAMES ON IT
AND EVERYTHING -- COOL!

251
00:10:09,174 --> 00:10:12,310
ALL RIGHT, SO WHERE
ARE YOU GOING ON THIS FLIGHT?

252
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:15,480
WEATHER PERMITTING --
YOU KNOW, SAFETY FIRST --

253
00:10:15,547 --> 00:10:19,317
I'LL BE UP AT THE CRACK OF NOON
AND I'M GOING DUE EAST--

254
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:21,819
NO, EAST IS OVER THIS WAY.

255
00:10:21,886 --> 00:10:23,154
SORRY, OK, RIGHT.

256
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:25,256
I'M GOING DUE EAST
TO PORT ASBESTOS--

257
00:10:25,323 --> 00:10:28,760
NO, PORT ASBESTOS, NOW,
THAT WOULD BE DOWN THIS WAY.

258
00:10:28,826 --> 00:10:30,094
REALLY?

259
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:31,496
OH, YEAH.

260
00:10:31,563 --> 00:10:36,067
FAR OUT! I'M FLYING IN THE
DIRECTION OF PORT ASBESTOS.

261
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:37,735
OK, AND THEN WHAT?

262
00:10:37,802 --> 00:10:41,773
I'M GONNA FLY TO PORT ASBESTOS
AND LAND, NON-STOP.

263
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,508
THAT'S ONLY ABOUT 20 MILES.

264
00:10:43,574 --> 00:10:46,277
THAT'S NOT GONNA BE
A LONG-DISTANCE RECORD.

265
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:48,780
OH, NO, I'M NOT GOING
FOR A WORLD RECORD.

266
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:50,114
THIS IS, UH...

267
00:10:50,181 --> 00:10:52,784
I'M SORT OF GOING
FOR A PERSONAL BEST HERE.

268
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,786
(Laughing)

269
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:56,354
OH! OH! OH...

270
00:10:58,022 --> 00:11:01,793
(Coughing)

271
00:11:01,859 --> 00:11:04,662
THIS IS EDGAR MONTROSE,
REMINDING YOU

272
00:11:04,729 --> 00:11:07,799
THAT USING
JUST A LITTLE EXTRA FUSE WIRE

273
00:11:07,865 --> 00:11:10,301
IS WORTH THE EXPENSE.

274
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:12,870
GIVE ME ANOTHER 30 YARDS!

275
00:11:14,972 --> 00:11:16,808
IT'S "MALE CALL"!

276
00:11:16,874 --> 00:11:20,311
(Applause and cheering)

277
00:11:20,378 --> 00:11:23,514
OUR LETTER TODAY COMES FROM FRED
FROM FENELON FALLS

278
00:11:23,581 --> 00:11:25,750
AND HE SENT US
SOME PHOTOS, HAROLD.

279
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:27,752
WHY DON'T YOU READ THE LETTER?

280
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:30,254
OKEY-DOKEY, IT GOES
AS FOLLOWS... UM...

281
00:11:30,321 --> 00:11:32,890
"THESE ARE PICTURES
FROM OUR FISHING TRIP.

282
00:11:32,957 --> 00:11:35,059
"THE FIRST ONE SHOWS
THE SIX OF US

283
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:37,862
"IN OUR FISHING OUTFITS,
MAKING SILLY FACES.

284
00:11:37,929 --> 00:11:41,232
"NEXT IS OUR FAVOURITE
FISHING SPOT, SIX STONE RIDGE.

285
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:43,334
"THE THIRD PHOTO
SHOWS OUR LUNCH,

286
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:45,603
"A HALF-DOZEN
OPEN-FACED SANDWICHES,

287
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,339
"AND FINALLY, TWO BIG TROUT
AND FOUR BASS."

288
00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:52,343
THESE ARE NOT THE CLEAREST
PICTURES I'VE SEEN, HAROLD.

289
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,779
I THINK THAT'S
THE FAMILY OF SIX.

290
00:11:54,846 --> 00:11:57,615
NO, I THINK THOSE ARE
THE SIX FISH, THERE.

291
00:11:57,682 --> 00:11:58,916
(Audience laughing)

292
00:11:58,983 --> 00:12:00,852
WHAT'S ALL THAT GREEN STUFF?

293
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:02,386
THAT'S... THAT'S MOSS.

294
00:12:02,453 --> 00:12:03,921
THAT'S THE SIX STONES.

295
00:12:03,988 --> 00:12:06,290
THAT COULD BE THE LETTUCE
ON THE SANDWICHES.

296
00:12:06,357 --> 00:12:07,792
AREN'T THOSE EYES?

297
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:09,794
THOSE ARE FISH-EYES, I THINK.

298
00:12:09,861 --> 00:12:11,295
NO, THOSE ARE PIMENTOS.

299
00:12:11,362 --> 00:12:12,630
OH, YEAH.

300
00:12:12,697 --> 00:12:14,799
THOSE ARE THE-- THOSE ARE THE--

301
00:12:14,865 --> 00:12:16,267
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

302
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:17,702
THOSE ARE THE FISH.

303
00:12:17,768 --> 00:12:19,637
THERE'S THE FISH
OVER HERE.

304
00:12:19,704 --> 00:12:21,505
LOOK, TWO TROUT,
FOUR BASS.

305
00:12:21,572 --> 00:12:24,875
OH... WHY ARE THE TROUT
WEARING RUNNING SHOES?

306
00:12:24,942 --> 00:12:28,045
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
THANKS FOR WRITING, FRED.

307
00:12:28,112 --> 00:12:31,949
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAD
A GREAT TIME ON YOUR HOLIDAY.

308
00:12:32,016 --> 00:12:35,953
EITHER THAT'S A DILL PICKLE
OR MOM NEEDS A NOSE JOB.

309
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,556
RANGER GORD,
THERE'S A LOT MORE TO YOUR JOB

310
00:12:38,623 --> 00:12:40,758
THAN JUST WATCHING
FOR FOREST FIRES.

311
00:12:40,825 --> 00:12:42,426
GOSH, YES, RED, INFINITELY.

312
00:12:42,493 --> 00:12:44,328
IF I ONLY HAD TO WAIT
FOR FIRES,

313
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:45,963
I'D HAVE GONE NUTS BY NOW.

314
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,932
I ALSO KEEP TRACK
OF THE WEATHER.

315
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,267
IT'S TIME TO TAKE
TODAY'S WEATHER REPORT.

316
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:51,769
IF YOU LIKE, YOU CAN WATCH.

317
00:12:51,836 --> 00:12:53,270
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

318
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:54,772
I DON'T MIND.

319
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,274
(Clearing throat)

320
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:58,776
SUNNY...

321
00:12:58,843 --> 00:13:01,278
WELL...

322
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:02,780
NO.

323
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,281
NO WAY -- PARTLY CLOUDY.

324
00:13:04,348 --> 00:13:06,283
I'D SAY SO, YEAH.

325
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,352
AND...

326
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:11,789
... WARM.

327
00:13:11,856 --> 00:13:13,290
OK, THERE IT IS.

328
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:16,127
YOU CALL THAT IN
TO THE WEATHER OFFICE?

329
00:13:16,193 --> 00:13:17,728
NO, I JUST KEEP THEM.

330
00:13:17,795 --> 00:13:20,531
I'VE GOT 16 YEARS
OF WEATHER REPORTS IN MY TOWER,

331
00:13:20,598 --> 00:13:21,532
ALL READY TO GO.

332
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:22,800
READY TO GO FOR WHAT?

333
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:24,135
WHATEVER.

334
00:13:24,201 --> 00:13:25,469
OH.

335
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:26,804
WHATEVER!!

336
00:13:26,871 --> 00:13:28,139
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!

337
00:13:28,205 --> 00:13:31,809
ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART
OF THE FOREST RANGER'S JOB

338
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:33,577
IS WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT.

339
00:13:33,644 --> 00:13:35,946
IT'S MY JOB TO WATCH
THE SPECIES

340
00:13:36,013 --> 00:13:38,716
AND TO MAKE SURE
THAT ANY ONE SPECIES

341
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:40,885
DOESN'T BECOME TOO NUMEROUS.

342
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:43,587
IF THEY DO,
I HAVE TO THIN THEM OUT.

343
00:13:43,654 --> 00:13:44,922
BY KILLING THEM, GORD?

344
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:46,257
YEAH.

345
00:13:46,323 --> 00:13:49,426
YEAH, IT'S NECESSARY
TO MAINTAIN NATURE'S BALANCE.

346
00:13:49,493 --> 00:13:51,061
I'M VERY CAREFUL, THOUGH.

347
00:13:51,128 --> 00:13:53,764
I ONLY TRY TO TAKE OUT
THE ELDERLY OR THE WEAK

348
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:55,266
OR THE VERY LONELY.

349
00:13:55,332 --> 00:13:56,901
UM, FOR INSTANCE, HERE.

350
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:59,136
LET'S HAVE A LOOK
AT THESE ANTS.

351
00:13:59,203 --> 00:14:01,772
YOU NOTICE
THERE'S WAY TOO MANY OF THEM.

352
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,274
YOU SEE THAT?

353
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,276
SO THEY HAVE TO BE THINNED OUT.

354
00:14:05,342 --> 00:14:06,777
HERE WE GO.

355
00:14:06,844 --> 00:14:08,279
(Yelling)

356
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:11,282
DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE!

357
00:14:11,348 --> 00:14:13,784
(Yelling)

358
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:16,287
OH, HE-E-E-ERE'S JOHNNY!

359
00:14:16,353 --> 00:14:18,789
OH, YOU THINK SO, HUH?

360
00:14:18,856 --> 00:14:20,291
AHHH!

361
00:14:20,357 --> 00:14:22,726
SEE THAT BIG ONE THERE?

362
00:14:22,793 --> 00:14:24,728
(Yelling)

363
00:14:24,795 --> 00:14:27,231
DIE! DIE! DIE!

364
00:14:27,298 --> 00:14:29,300
(Yelling)

365
00:14:32,803 --> 00:14:35,239
LIKE I SAID, IT KEEPS ME SANE.

366
00:14:35,306 --> 00:14:39,743
WELL, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE DOING IT ENOUGH, THEN.

367
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,245
OK.

368
00:14:41,312 --> 00:14:43,814
(Yelling)

369
00:14:43,881 --> 00:14:45,949
(Humming)

370
00:14:46,016 --> 00:14:49,219
THE POSSUM LODGE COMPOSTER
HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY OPENED.

371
00:14:49,286 --> 00:14:50,721
WE'RE ACCEPTING ANYTHING

372
00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:53,123
FROM ANYONE WHO WANTS
TO DUMP SOMETHING.

373
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,559
WE'VE HAD SCRAPS OF BROCCOLI
AND TURNIP,

374
00:14:55,626 --> 00:14:57,428
BUT SO FAR, IT'S MOSTLY TIRES.

375
00:14:57,494 --> 00:15:00,864
UNCLE RED, YOU CAN'T MAKE
TOPSOIL OUT OF TIRES.

376
00:15:00,931 --> 00:15:02,666
YOU NEED PLANT MATERIAL.

377
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:04,268
IT'S A CHEMICAL REACTION.

378
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:06,270
IF YOU HAVE CHEMICALS,
YOU'LL HAVE REACTIONS.

379
00:15:06,336 --> 00:15:08,205
IT'S SITTING THERE NOW.

380
00:15:08,272 --> 00:15:11,942
STINKY'S GONNA BRING SOME
PAINT CANS AND SOME KIELBASA.

381
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:13,744
THAT SHOULD GET 'ER GOING.

382
00:15:13,811 --> 00:15:18,715
LIFE'S SO SIMPLE WHEN YOU DON'T
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

383
00:15:18,782 --> 00:15:21,985
(Red): MEANWHILE, BACK AT
THE CHIPPER AND SHREDDER,

384
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:24,455
WE'RE STILL TRYING
TO HAVE AN ADVENTURE.

385
00:15:24,521 --> 00:15:27,224
WE USED TO RENT THESE THINGS,
THESE UNITS.

386
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,892
THEY'RE PRETTY--

387
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,227
... PRETTY EXPENSIVE.

388
00:15:30,294 --> 00:15:31,728
WELL, THAT WILL BE FINE.

389
00:15:31,795 --> 00:15:33,230
IT WILL BE COVERED.

390
00:15:33,297 --> 00:15:34,731
JUST GET-- OW! OW!

391
00:15:34,798 --> 00:15:36,233
BY GOLLY.

392
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,402
ANYWAY-- NO, BILL,
GET THE HAND OUT.

393
00:15:38,468 --> 00:15:40,237
GET THE HAND OUT --
THERE WE GO.

394
00:15:40,304 --> 00:15:41,638
YEAH, GET THE HAND--

395
00:15:41,705 --> 00:15:44,508
THESE UNITS ARE GAS-POWERED,
WITH A FOUR-CYCLE.

396
00:15:44,575 --> 00:15:46,510
YOU DON'T NEED A LOT OF POWER.

397
00:15:46,577 --> 00:15:48,912
THEY REALLY THROW
THE CHIPS, THOUGH.

398
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:52,082
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU...
THAT YOU EMPTY THE UNIT,

399
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:53,517
UM, BEFORE STARTING.

400
00:15:53,584 --> 00:15:56,253
YOU PUT THE BRANCHES IN,
AND LOOK AT THAT THING.

401
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,654
ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL?

402
00:15:57,721 --> 00:15:59,256
JUST SHRED EVERYTHING UP.

403
00:15:59,323 --> 00:16:01,258
THEY'RE A GOOD UNIT.

404
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:03,093
THOSE ARE ROCKS OR STONES.

405
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,528
YOU'RE GONNA-- BILL!

406
00:16:04,595 --> 00:16:06,930
THOSE ARE GONNA FIRE
OUT OF THERE!

407
00:16:06,997 --> 00:16:08,231
OH, MY GOSH!

408
00:16:08,298 --> 00:16:09,866
LOOK OUT! LOOK OUT!

409
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:11,368
I PUT THE VAN

410
00:16:11,435 --> 00:16:12,869
BEHIND THE BARN.

411
00:16:12,936 --> 00:16:14,371
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

412
00:16:14,438 --> 00:16:16,707
NO, TAKE IT OFF
THE PITCHFORK, BILL.

413
00:16:16,773 --> 00:16:18,275
TAKE IT OFF THE PITCHFORK.

414
00:16:18,342 --> 00:16:19,943
NO, I DON'T MEAN THAT WAY.

415
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,378
NO, BILL, THAT'S--

416
00:16:21,445 --> 00:16:22,779
METAL FORK-- METAL--

417
00:16:22,846 --> 00:16:24,414
HANG ON, HANG ON, HANG ON!

418
00:16:24,481 --> 00:16:25,749
OH, BOY! OH, BOY!

419
00:16:25,816 --> 00:16:27,217
OH, BOY!

420
00:16:27,284 --> 00:16:29,286
OHHHH, MAN!

421
00:16:29,353 --> 00:16:32,089
ALL RIGHT, BILL,
DON'T EVER DO--

422
00:16:32,155 --> 00:16:33,557
BILL, YOU'RE--

423
00:16:33,623 --> 00:16:34,891
COME ON OUT OF THERE.

424
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,326
STOP PLAYING IN--

425
00:16:36,393 --> 00:16:37,661
DON'T PLAY IN THERE.

426
00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:38,996
GET OUT OF THERE.

427
00:16:39,062 --> 00:16:40,831
OUT YOU COME, OUT YOU COME.

428
00:16:40,897 --> 00:16:42,165
ONE GOOD YANK AND--

429
00:16:42,232 --> 00:16:44,034
OH! SHOE'S COME OFF!

430
00:16:44,101 --> 00:16:45,535
OH, BOY! OH, BOY!

431
00:16:45,602 --> 00:16:47,304
OHHHH!

432
00:16:48,805 --> 00:16:50,741
YOU ALL RIGHT, BILL?

433
00:16:50,807 --> 00:16:52,242
(Groaning)

434
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:55,746
WELL, HE'S SHREDDED,
BUT HE LOOKS PRETTY CHIPPER.

435
00:16:55,812 --> 00:16:57,247
(Laughing)

436
00:16:57,314 --> 00:17:00,183
OH, MAN.

437
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:04,321
STAY TUNED FOR AN IMPORTANT
LESSON ON PAINT FUMES.

438
00:17:07,824 --> 00:17:09,659
WHOO!

439
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:11,294
HO! HEY! OW! HELLO!

440
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:12,929
WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

441
00:17:12,996 --> 00:17:14,431
WHOA

442
00:17:14,498 --> 00:17:15,765
(Laughing)

443
00:17:15,832 --> 00:17:17,100
IT'S GREAT, ISN'T IT?

444
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:19,736
THE OLD COMPOSTER'S
REALLY STARTING TO HUM.

445
00:17:19,803 --> 00:17:21,505
OH! ARGH!

446
00:17:21,571 --> 00:17:25,475
THE TRUCK BATTERIES
KIND OF GAVE IT A JUMP-START.

447
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:26,843
I HEARD AN EXPLOSION.

448
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,912
HOW DO YOU MAKE COMPOST
EXPLODE?

449
00:17:28,979 --> 00:17:30,647
I NEVER HEARD
OF THAT BEFORE.

450
00:17:30,714 --> 00:17:32,782
WE ARE THE MEN
OF POSSUM LODGE, HAROLD.

451
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:34,184
WE'RE CUTTING-EDGE.

452
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:36,286
(Audience laughing)

453
00:17:36,353 --> 00:17:38,755
CUTTING CORNERS
IS MORE LIKE IT!

454
00:17:38,822 --> 00:17:40,423
I SAW BUSTER
THROWING

455
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,925
A MATTRESS ON THERE.

456
00:17:41,992 --> 00:17:44,361
COMPOSTERS DON'T LIKE
MATTRESSES.

457
00:17:44,427 --> 00:17:46,563
WELL, HE SEEMED TO ENJOY IT.

458
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,898
"HE"?

459
00:17:47,964 --> 00:17:49,799
IT'S ONE OF THE GUYS NOW?

460
00:17:49,866 --> 00:17:51,234
YEAH, YEAH.

461
00:17:51,301 --> 00:17:52,569
WE GAVE IT A NAME.

462
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:54,404
WE CALL IT IAN THE COMPOSTER.

463
00:17:54,471 --> 00:17:57,974
WE PUT THE MATTRESS ON, AND
IAN SNIFFED AT IT AND THEN...

464
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:01,111
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE MAP OF THE PONDEROSA

465
00:18:01,177 --> 00:18:03,013
AT THE BEGINNING OF "BONANZA"?

466
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:04,481
YEAH, LITTLE BROWN SPOT.

467
00:18:04,547 --> 00:18:07,584
IT GOES UP IN FLAMES
AND THE WHOLE MAP'S IN SMOKE.

468
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:10,287
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE MATTRESS.

469
00:18:10,353 --> 00:18:12,489
INSTEAD OF FLAMES,
IT WAS GREEN GOO.

470
00:18:12,555 --> 00:18:15,058
THAT'S WHEN THE REALLY BAD
SMELL STARTED.

471
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,294
EVEN STINKY PETERSON
IS COMPLAINING.

472
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,596
WOULDN'T BE SO BAD
IF WE WERE UPWIND.

473
00:18:19,663 --> 00:18:20,930
WE ARE.

474
00:18:20,997 --> 00:18:22,265
OH, BOY.

475
00:18:22,332 --> 00:18:23,767
YEAH.

476
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,468
(Audience laughing)

477
00:18:25,535 --> 00:18:28,605
WE'RE ALL SET TO PLAY
OUR POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME

478
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:31,274
WITH ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER
GARTH HARBLE.

479
00:18:31,341 --> 00:18:33,376
JUST GET THE WORD FROM HAROLD

480
00:18:33,443 --> 00:18:35,445
AND SHOW IT TO THE PEOPLE
AT HOME.

481
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:37,113
AHHH...

482
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,950
SAY THIS IN 30 SECONDS OR LESS,
YOU'LL WIN OUR GRAND PRIZE --

483
00:18:41,017 --> 00:18:43,787
A YEAR'S SUPPLY OF LAXATIVES
AND A USED TUBA.

484
00:18:43,853 --> 00:18:45,288
OH, OK.

485
00:18:45,355 --> 00:18:46,790
YOU READY TO GO?

486
00:18:46,856 --> 00:18:48,291
OK.

487
00:18:48,358 --> 00:18:49,793
UH... GUIDANCE.

488
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:51,294
GUIDANCE, GUIDANCE, GUIDANCE...

489
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:52,796
GUIDANCE COUNSELLOR.

490
00:18:52,862 --> 00:18:54,297
USELESS, USELESS.

491
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:56,633
NO, THAT SQUIRREL
MAULED YOUR ARM.

492
00:18:56,699 --> 00:18:57,967
IT WAS OUT OF...

493
00:18:58,034 --> 00:18:59,302
... ITS GOURD.

494
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:02,172
NO, NO -- PROBABLY,
BUT WHAT IT LACKED WAS...

495
00:19:02,238 --> 00:19:03,807
VITAMIN "C", I WOULD SAY.

496
00:19:03,873 --> 00:19:06,309
PEOPLE WEAR A GIRDLE
BECAUSE IT GIVES THEM...

497
00:19:06,376 --> 00:19:07,811
... A RASH.

498
00:19:07,877 --> 00:19:09,145
WHAT?

499
00:19:09,212 --> 00:19:10,480
UH, I'VE BEEN TOLD.

500
00:19:10,547 --> 00:19:11,815
ALMOST OUT OF TIME.

501
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:13,283
WHAT DO YOU DO TO ANIMALS?

502
00:19:13,349 --> 00:19:15,051
CLEAN 'EM, GROOM 'EM,
CURSE 'EM!

503
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:16,820
WHAT IT SAYS ON YOUR TRUCK.

504
00:19:16,886 --> 00:19:18,154
UH, ISUZU!

505
00:19:18,221 --> 00:19:19,489
NO, YOUR JOB NAME!

506
00:19:19,556 --> 00:19:20,824
UH, AREA REPRESENTATIVE!

507
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,826
WHAT DO MEAN PEOPLE DO
TO ANIMALS?

508
00:19:22,892 --> 00:19:24,661
TURN 'EM INTO CHICKEN FINGERS!

509
00:19:24,727 --> 00:19:25,995
REALLY?

510
00:19:26,062 --> 00:19:27,330
YEAH, APPARENTLY.

511
00:19:27,397 --> 00:19:29,332
OK, WHAT YOUR BOSS DOES TO YOU.

512
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:31,334
OHHHH! CONTROL!

513
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:33,169
THAT'S THE ONE!

514
00:19:33,236 --> 00:19:35,672
BOY, THAT WAS GREAT.

515
00:19:35,738 --> 00:19:42,845
ALL RIGHT, THE IMPORTANT THING
WHEN USING SOLVENTS IS, UH...

516
00:19:42,912 --> 00:19:44,847
CAN'T REMEMBER RIGHT NOW.

517
00:19:44,914 --> 00:19:46,349
(Laughing)

518
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,351
OH, THAT'S PRETTY, ISN'T IT?

519
00:19:48,418 --> 00:19:49,852
OH, HELLO!

520
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,922
UH, YEAH, I THINK IT'S, UM...

521
00:19:54,924 --> 00:19:56,859
UH, THERE'S SOMETHING.

522
00:19:56,926 --> 00:19:59,362
BOY, THAT WAS A GREAT ALBUM.

523
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:01,364
OHHH... OHHHHH...

524
00:20:01,431 --> 00:20:03,366
NO, NO, I REMEMBER --
VENTILATION.

525
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:07,770
IT'S 3:00 IN THE MORNING.

526
00:20:07,837 --> 00:20:11,307
SHE'S ROLLING OUT OF BED
TO ANSWER THE CALL O' NATURE.

527
00:20:11,374 --> 00:20:13,776
SHE'S LIVED WITH YOU
FOR 15 YEARS

528
00:20:13,843 --> 00:20:16,813
SO THERE'S NO NEED
TO TURN THE LIGHT ON.

529
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:20,316
AND THEN YOU HEAR
THAT CRASH AND SPLASH

530
00:20:20,383 --> 00:20:21,818
AND THAT SHRIEK.

531
00:20:21,884 --> 00:20:25,321
(Audience laughing)

532
00:20:25,388 --> 00:20:28,324
SHE TOLD YOU
TO LEAVE THE SEAT DOWN.

533
00:20:28,391 --> 00:20:30,326
(Audience laughing)

534
00:20:30,393 --> 00:20:33,830
YOU PROMISED HER
YOU'D LEAVE THE SEAT DOWN.

535
00:20:33,896 --> 00:20:35,498
GUESS WHAT.

536
00:20:35,565 --> 00:20:38,334
SEAT WASN'T DOWN.
SEAT WASN'T DOWN.

537
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:42,338
NOW SHE'S GOT A COLD PORCELAIN
RING AROUND A WARM PART OF HER,

538
00:20:42,405 --> 00:20:45,341
HER KNEES ARE UP TO HER CHIN,
AND SHE'S STUCK.

539
00:20:45,408 --> 00:20:47,844
(Audience laughing)

540
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,480
SHE'S THE ONE
SPORTING A BULL'S-EYE

541
00:20:50,546 --> 00:20:52,849
BUT YOU'RE THE ONE IN TROUBLE.

542
00:20:52,915 --> 00:20:56,352
MAJOR DEEP, SO WHAT DO YOU DO?

543
00:20:56,419 --> 00:20:58,354
CAN'T HELP YOU THERE,
LITTLE BUDDY.

544
00:20:58,421 --> 00:21:00,356
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

545
00:21:00,423 --> 00:21:02,358
(Audience laughing)

546
00:21:02,425 --> 00:21:03,659
(Applause)

547
00:21:03,726 --> 00:21:05,161
WELL, I'LL TELL YA.

548
00:21:05,228 --> 00:21:08,464
LIFE IS STILL THE SAME MYSTERY
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN.

549
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:09,866
WELL, NO,
UNCLE RED,

550
00:21:09,932 --> 00:21:12,068
I'M SORRY I WAS DOUBTING
YOU GUYS.

551
00:21:12,134 --> 00:21:14,237
I DO NOT SMELL
IAN THE COMPOSTER,

552
00:21:14,303 --> 00:21:17,707
SO YOU WERE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
IN WHAT YOU WERE DOING.

553
00:21:17,773 --> 00:21:19,876
DON'T BE SO SURE, HAROLD.

554
00:21:19,942 --> 00:21:21,344
I WAS WRONG -- I'M SORRY.

555
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:24,213
I DON'T SMELL IAN
SO YOU WERE RIGHT IN PUTTING IN

556
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,916
THOSE MOTOR WINDINGS
AND ANTIFREEZE AND SOCKS.

557
00:21:26,983 --> 00:21:28,417
I WAS WRONG.

558
00:21:28,484 --> 00:21:32,755
THE REASON YOU DON'T SMELL IAN
IS BECAUSE HE'S GONE, HAROLD.

559
00:21:32,822 --> 00:21:34,190
WHAT?

560
00:21:34,257 --> 00:21:36,425
GONE? HOW'S HE GONE?

561
00:21:36,492 --> 00:21:38,961
HE LEFT UNDER HIS OWN POWER
IN THE NIGHT.

562
00:21:39,028 --> 00:21:41,230
HE GOT UP,
AND YOU CAN SEE THE PATH.

563
00:21:41,297 --> 00:21:44,900
THE GRASS IS DEAD AND THERE'S
ACID BURNS IN THE TREE BARK.

564
00:21:44,967 --> 00:21:46,969
UNCLE RED,
WHAT HAVE YOU CREATED?

565
00:21:47,036 --> 00:21:49,839
THAT MONSTROSITY'S HEADING
RIGHT FOR TOWN!

566
00:21:49,905 --> 00:21:52,842
HAROLD, HE'LL HAVE TO CROSS
MERCURY CREEK.

567
00:21:52,908 --> 00:21:54,844
(Laughing)

568
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,612
IF THAT DOESN'T FINISH HIM,

569
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:58,848
THE PUNKS
AT THE VIDEO ARCADE WILL.

570
00:21:58,914 --> 00:22:01,417
OH, YEAH!

571
00:22:01,484 --> 00:22:04,920
LOOK AT THIS --
YOU DID ALL THAT WORK, BUT YET,

572
00:22:04,987 --> 00:22:08,290
(Singing) YOU STILL DO NOT
GET YOUR FREE BEER NUTS.

573
00:22:08,357 --> 00:22:10,259
WRONG AGAIN,
MR. OVERBITE.

574
00:22:10,326 --> 00:22:12,361
SOMEBODY
BROUGHT OVER

575
00:22:12,428 --> 00:22:14,897
A 50-GALLON DRUM
OF OLD PEANUT BUTTER.

576
00:22:14,964 --> 00:22:17,033
WE FISHED THAT OUT OF THE PILE.

577
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:19,835
WE'LL ROLL IT INTO BALLS,
DRY IT, SALT IT,

578
00:22:19,902 --> 00:22:21,303
AND GOBBLE THEM DOWN.

579
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,805
WELL, ISN'T THAT NICE?

580
00:22:22,872 --> 00:22:25,474
YOU'LL BECOME
YOUR OWN LITTLE COMPOSTER.

581
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:26,809
(Possum squeal)

582
00:22:26,876 --> 00:22:28,310
MEETING TIME.

583
00:22:28,377 --> 00:22:31,814
GRAB SOME PEANUT BUTTER
AND START ROLLING.

584
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:34,150
CLEAN YOUR FINGERNAILS FIRST.

585
00:22:34,216 --> 00:22:35,551
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

586
00:22:35,618 --> 00:22:37,620
I'M COMING HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

587
00:22:37,686 --> 00:22:40,589
THIS IS A GOOD NIGHT
TO INVITE YOUR PARENTS OVER.

588
00:22:40,656 --> 00:22:43,192
I'VE SEEN SO MANY CHEMICAL
REACTIONS TODAY,

589
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:45,861
IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE
WITH SOMETHING INERT.

590
00:22:45,928 --> 00:22:48,197
THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

591
00:22:48,264 --> 00:22:51,033
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND HAROLD AND THE GANG,

592
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,835
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

593
00:22:52,902 --> 00:22:54,837
(Applause)

594
00:22:54,904 --> 00:22:56,505
(Cheering and whistling)

595
00:22:56,572 --> 00:22:58,007
(Possum squeal)

596
00:22:58,073 --> 00:22:59,909
(Harold): OK, STAND UP.

597
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:07,016
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

598
00:23:08,617 --> 00:23:11,020
(Harold): THE TRAVELLING DENTIST
IS COMING THROUGH TOWN AGAIN.

599
00:23:11,086 --> 00:23:13,222
IF YOU CAN'T MAKE IT,
LEAVE YOUR TEETH IN A BOX

600
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:15,424
AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM.
