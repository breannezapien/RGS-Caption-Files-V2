1
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,365
Hi, this is red green in today's show, Harold
criticizes adults, bill shows as camping

2
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,367
lanterns and I turn a patio table into a
windsurfer.

3
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:44,444
Here's the man who put the out and out house.

4
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:47,814
He's the greatest uncle I could ever have
unless, of course I was adopted, but I

5
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,883
wasn't. So no such luck for me anyway.

6
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,050
Here he is. Mr.

7
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,418
Red. Green.

8
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:08,368
Thank you very much, and thanks for joining
us in kind of an interesting introduction,

9
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:08,968
Mary Harold.

10
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,436
Well, you know me, Mr.

11
00:01:10,436 --> 00:01:13,439
Shelby, is what

12
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,710
Actually I was referring to that bit about
you being adopted.

13
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,180
You know, if you'd been adopted, Harold,
then of course you wouldn't be my nephew and

14
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,415
then I wouldn't have had to give you this
job.

15
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:27,353
Yeah, but I don't think anybody would adopt
me at this, you know, advanced development

16
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:28,121
stage that I'm in.

17
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,591
Well, then OK, we could do the Moses thing.

18
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:36,896
We can duct tape you into a kayak and float
you down the Nile.

19
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:42,368
Oh, wow. Yeah, now I know you're just kidding
because there's no boats around this large

20
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:43,336
can float that far.

21
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:47,807
Well, he does have a point there, with the
exception, of course, of John Singleton's

22
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:48,207
boat.

23
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:51,644
Yeah, right. And you're single. Yeah, there's
so many holes in that boat.

24
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,479
No way junior could fix all those holes.

25
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,515
No, no, no.

26
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:56,849
Hell, he's not going to fix the holes.

27
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,151
Junior has upgraded his bill.

28
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:03,489
Trump. What he did was he went down to the
army surplus store and he bought Catch this a

29
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:07,460
used rocket fuel pump off a Russian
intercontinental ballistic missile.

30
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:12,031
I'll tell you, the army surplus store sure
has some interesting merchandise since the

31
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:12,899
arms race ended.

32
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,902
Ok, good because I like that.

33
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:18,471
You know, I'm in favor of beating swords
into plowshares.

34
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:22,375
Or should I say, you know, beating rocket
fuel equipment into building booms?

35
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,044
How about beating you into a small plant
lump?

36
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:35,688
Anyway, Junior got the big, huge pump ball
mounted inside is inside his boat there, you

37
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:40,226
know, and suddenly got a bit of a surprise
when she dropped right through the hull down

38
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:42,328
to the bottom, the lake and she was running
at the time.

39
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,796
So this is what we call a setback.

40
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:48,701
And but by golly, that is some kind of pump
been kept running down the bottom of the lake

41
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:51,704
and within 15 minutes it had pumped the
whole possum lake totally dry.

42
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,607
Awesome lake was pumped dry.

43
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,209
The possible lake is gone now.

44
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:00,079
Oh no, no, no. What it did was it temporarily
transferred the lake up to the top of the

45
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:03,649
hill and then the pump ran out of gas and
the water came back down again.

46
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,521
But but in the meanwhile, it gave us a
chance to get it on and on to the bottom of

47
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:12,124
the dry lake. And we got some of our old
boats back and a few of our appliances and so

48
00:03:12,124 --> 00:03:16,896
on, and we could fix some of the divots from
Loose Thompson doing cannonballs off the boat

49
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:22,535
house. And most importantly, we got Junior's
great big pump back up there and we've

50
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,136
decided we're going to do something else
with it.

51
00:03:24,503 --> 00:03:26,072
We're going to use it to collect maple
syrup.

52
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:31,711
It's not maple syrup time,

53
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:35,181
Harold with a pump this size, any time it's
maple syrup.

54
00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:41,153
Ok. Ok, I'll go ahead, you know, I'm, you
know, I'm not a tree expert or anything, but

55
00:03:41,153 --> 00:03:43,756
I don't think you can just get the sap to do
whatever you want it to do.

56
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,725
Oh sure, you can Harold get on with show?

57
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,827
We'll see.

58
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:59,538
My butterfly collection gives me so much
pride, my butterfly collection makes me warm

59
00:03:59,538 --> 00:04:02,508
inside the monarch's blues and yellows.

60
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:07,146
These are beauties an old man, come and see
my butterfly collection.

61
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,849
They're all wedged in the grill of my van.

62
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:19,492
This week, Handymen Corner, we're going to
show you an interesting project that you can

63
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:22,194
make with one of them patio umbrella tables.

64
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:26,165
Now I know the patio tables are supposed to
be used in your backyard for entertaining

65
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,300
your neighbors, but I'd rather do something
fun.

66
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,537
I'd rather use them for windsurfing.

67
00:04:32,404 --> 00:04:33,873
All right. Talk is cheap.

68
00:04:34,006 --> 00:04:36,041
Let's build step one.

69
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:40,179
Remove the umbrella. Put it away somewhere
safe for later.

70
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:49,021
Here we go. Now what you want to do is you
want to draw out the design of your wind

71
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:50,589
surfer on top of the table so you can cut it
out.

72
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:55,127
And for that, you're going to need some kind
of a marker and get yourself a ruler so you

73
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:56,462
can keep the edges nice and straight.

74
00:04:59,798 --> 00:05:05,471
Oh, you know what? The dampness and the
fungi in the moss up here on a work, it's up

75
00:05:05,504 --> 00:05:06,605
the line. So I'll just.

76
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:09,775
I'll just eyeball it.

77
00:05:23,255 --> 00:05:24,890
I bowled out pretty good, didn't I?

78
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:29,995
Ok, there we are. And now what we do is we
cut along all those lines that cut out our

79
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:33,632
surfboard. Now you could use a hands off or
that or if you've got a real good eye, you

80
00:05:33,632 --> 00:05:37,770
could use an axe. To me, this is a carving
job for a carving job.

81
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,938
I want to use an electric knife.

82
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:46,178
That's either peanut butter or last year's
turkey.

83
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:12,938
Now you want to take all these pieces and
turn this thing into the shape of a

84
00:06:12,938 --> 00:06:18,043
surfboard. Because if those college kids see
you surfing on a patio table, you're going to

85
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:19,978
be the brunt of some insensitive comments.

86
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:23,081
Wavy pharmaceuticals here.

87
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:24,550
And this goes here together here.

88
00:06:24,783 --> 00:06:25,984
This goes back here.

89
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:31,023
And then you take these two pieces and you
put those together to form yourself a rudder.

90
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:35,661
Now what you do is you attach everything
together using either the epoxy cement or

91
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:40,933
maybe you like to use bolts and nuts and so
on, or whatever fastening technique you feel

92
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,067
most confident with.

93
00:06:46,471 --> 00:06:48,340
I prefer the man secret weapon.

94
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,444
Duct tape. Boy, that makes you feel like
shooting a girl, isn't it?

95
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:55,280
Look at all the cobwebs up there.

96
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:56,915
Oh, well.

97
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:05,824
There we go now.

98
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,427
I've already hoisted our sail.

99
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:15,000
I call it I call it a sale now because it's
I'm lucky to open umbrella and doors and I

100
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,236
put a big wad of duct tape on here so that
it doesn't go too far in, which is a handy

101
00:07:18,236 --> 00:07:21,106
thing to remember. Pop that in there.

102
00:07:23,475 --> 00:07:27,579
Looks like we got a pretty good breeze going
out there, so why don't we try and catch the

103
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:31,750
wind? As Donovan would say, they won't open
up the big door there.

104
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:39,357
All right, so remember the women don't find
you handsome, at least find a happy meal on

105
00:07:39,357 --> 00:07:39,925
the patio.

106
00:07:45,163 --> 00:07:52,938
Wipe out. And now it's up out of this hole,
we expose those three little words men find

107
00:07:52,938 --> 00:07:55,574
so difficult to say, I don't know.

108
00:07:57,542 --> 00:08:00,779
And here to prove that point once again on
the experts portion of the show is my uncle

109
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:03,014
read and his best friend in the whole world.

110
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:05,584
Oh, OK, Mr.

111
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:14,993
Dougie Franklin. All right, dear

112
00:08:14,993 --> 00:08:19,831
experts. My son has had several throat
infections over the years, and our doctor is

113
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:23,835
now saying he should have his tonsils out,
which I thought was no longer a recommended

114
00:08:23,835 --> 00:08:25,837
procedure. What are your thoughts?

115
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:32,043
My advice to this person is get away from
this doctor and every doctor

116
00:08:32,043 --> 00:08:34,246
As fast as you can fully.

117
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:39,251
So you don't think this viewer should see a
doctor then?

118
00:08:39,618 --> 00:08:41,419
I don't think anybody should see a doctor.

119
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:43,655
You know, the human body is nobody's
business.

120
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:45,023
You know,

121
00:08:46,691 --> 00:08:49,027
My daddy never saw a doctor a day in his
life.

122
00:08:49,294 --> 00:08:53,598
Now he he smoked a pack and a half of
cigarettes, planes a day.

123
00:08:53,798 --> 00:08:55,400
And you know,

124
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:59,471
Sure, once in a while, he might get a little
coughing spell that might last

125
00:08:59,471 --> 00:09:00,839
Like a weekend or so.

126
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,643
But apart from that, he was as healthy

127
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:05,810
As you or I.

128
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:08,346
So you've never been to a doctor, either,
Doug.

129
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,549
Never been to a doctor, a dentist or a
psychiatrist.

130
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:16,888
I'm telling you. The human body was not
designed to be repaired from the outside.

131
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:19,858
The Good Lord had meant this to be.

132
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:21,960
He would have put a hood on it somewhere.

133
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:30,468
Soon, as you've got a slash through skin or
start sawing through bone, you got to

134
00:09:30,468 --> 00:09:33,938
Know you're dealing with something that was
designed to be maintenance free.

135
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,813
I'll tell you, you get in there and start
tinkering with stuff and you're going to void

136
00:09:41,813 --> 00:09:44,516
your warranty with that master mechanic in
the sky.

137
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:44,949
I'll tell you.

138
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:54,359
It is winter cousin Jerry was lying in the
snow, making snow angels, along came the snow

139
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:57,228
plow. Now cousin Jerry is making real
angels.

140
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:06,037
Oh, man, not again,

141
00:10:07,071 --> 00:10:07,839
This thing ready to go.

142
00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:13,878
Oh yo, red, hey, no problem, oh, hey yo,
Harold,

143
00:10:18,349 --> 00:10:19,817
Oh, you're all right here. I'll get up
planes.

144
00:10:21,352 --> 00:10:22,387
The planes OK to fly.

145
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,156
Oh man, Norwegian Wood, this bird has flown
Errol.

146
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:28,059
There's a dark spider going up your leg
there.

147
00:10:28,793 --> 00:10:30,328
She needs a new carburetor.

148
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:32,297
You know, that's like a hundred bucks.

149
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:35,433
And like, I don't want to spend that kind of
bread on a plane like this.

150
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm in the

151
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,938
Air. What I was thinking was that if I got
buzz here to take me up in his airplane, I

152
00:10:39,938 --> 00:10:43,408
could kind of get an aerial view of the
trees around the lodge and see which ones

153
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:44,943
would be good for our syrup business.

154
00:10:45,109 --> 00:10:46,477
I wasn't sure about the plane, though.

155
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:48,579
Here, we don't need that stuff.

156
00:10:48,813 --> 00:10:49,314
Oh, no,

157
00:10:49,314 --> 00:10:51,149
No, no. We'll be fine, I'm sure.

158
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:53,051
Well, we'll soon find out,

159
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,256
But it doesn't instill a lot of confidence in
its passengers.

160
00:10:58,256 --> 00:11:03,061
But I still figure this has got to be the
quickest, easiest way to identify all the

161
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:04,629
maple trees around the lodge.

162
00:11:05,797 --> 00:11:08,766
But I'm just looking for a maple tree that's
all maple.

163
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,634
Yeah, I

164
00:11:09,634 --> 00:11:11,969
Don't know if we got any maple around here,
you know?

165
00:11:12,103 --> 00:11:16,507
See, we got we got the spruce and poplar and
pine and aluminum.

166
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:20,478
Oh man, I hate those TV antennas.

167
00:11:22,447 --> 00:11:25,483
I can't, you know, I was going to kind of
look from the air, but I think maybe now a

168
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:26,851
ground survey, I'll get my own mail.

169
00:11:26,984 --> 00:11:27,585
Oh, sorry.

170
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,954
Keep the faith. You can't walk down, bro.

171
00:11:29,987 --> 00:11:31,689
No way. That's bad karma.

172
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:33,191
You watch. You watch.

173
00:11:33,224 --> 00:11:35,026
I mean, if you walked away now, right?

174
00:11:35,026 --> 00:11:38,062
Any money, I'd start up the plane and
something like would fly off it and with

175
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:39,931
legs, just sever your spine.

176
00:11:40,565 --> 00:11:43,000
Don't worry. Don't worry, I got parachutes.

177
00:11:44,335 --> 00:11:47,805
Somewhere. All right.

178
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:51,909
See that red line when I say now, turn it
all the way to the right.

179
00:11:52,076 --> 00:11:52,510
Cool.

180
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,244
All right. All right.

181
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:04,121
No. Hey, look at it this way, at least you
won't hear the roar of the engine.

182
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:10,428
Bring it on. That's.

183
00:12:21,272 --> 00:12:24,508
Well, my idea of gathering surf has really
taken off.

184
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:29,480
We got juniors big punk ball tuned up and
Moose is out there drilling holes on every

185
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,514
tree you can find.

186
00:12:30,982 --> 00:12:34,485
We're going to connect the trees to the
intake manifold by everybody has donated the

187
00:12:34,485 --> 00:12:38,923
brake lines from their cars and pretty soon
we're going to be sucking out a fortune worth

188
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:39,323
of syrup.

189
00:12:40,591 --> 00:12:41,926
Well, this is great.

190
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:42,893
How did you clean all the

191
00:12:42,893 --> 00:12:44,228
Brake fluid out of the lines?

192
00:12:44,762 --> 00:12:45,296
How do you mean?

193
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:51,969
The brake fluid, you know, you've got to
clean the lines, I don't think people want a

194
00:12:51,969 --> 00:12:54,138
taste brake fluid with their maple syrup.

195
00:12:54,238 --> 00:12:55,773
Oh oh, come on, Harold.

196
00:12:55,773 --> 00:12:57,074
All food has chemicals in it.

197
00:12:58,843 --> 00:13:03,147
And besides, it's part of our slogan, the
syrup that puts the brakes on hunger.

198
00:13:05,182 --> 00:13:08,486
I'm telling you, this is going to be a real
moneymaker for us, this is the big one right

199
00:13:08,486 --> 00:13:09,887
here. Oh yeah, I've

200
00:13:09,887 --> 00:13:13,924
Heard that before. What about the, you know,
the plywood car or the the peekaboo hip

201
00:13:13,924 --> 00:13:14,325
waders?

202
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,129
Now that's different, Harold.

203
00:13:18,596 --> 00:13:21,499
This is the big one right here. We're
already working on the marketing angle for

204
00:13:21,632 --> 00:13:23,334
Uncle Red's special syrup.

205
00:13:25,903 --> 00:13:28,739
What is that like a Ghostbuster action figure
or something?

206
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,377
No, and that's the Uncle Red pancake syrup
dispenser with the no drip head.

207
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:40,217
A little twinge of jealousy there.

208
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:40,584
Heroin?

209
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,487
No, it's more like a wave of nausea.

210
00:13:45,122 --> 00:13:49,360
Well, go read, it's Trey uncool, seeing you
about six inches high made a squeezable

211
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,028
plastic stuffed with maple syrup.

212
00:13:51,862 --> 00:13:56,467
Oh, Harold. Maple syrup, we got moose to
drill holes and all kinds of trees, so we got

213
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:58,068
oak syrup, pine syrup, spruce.

214
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,038
Thirty one flavors are.

215
00:14:02,873 --> 00:14:04,742
We're going to corner the syrup market.

216
00:14:05,442 --> 00:14:09,480
Oh, yeah, I bet you that Aunt Jemima just
shaking in her scarf.

217
00:14:17,388 --> 00:14:22,259
When tanks were laying out across the farm,
it blew all the hair off my granny's arm.

218
00:14:22,893 --> 00:14:27,665
Was the livestock down into the, well, blue,
the clappers off the town hall bell?

219
00:14:27,898 --> 00:14:30,034
It was a lesson we learned and we learned it
well.

220
00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:35,439
There's one heck of a lot of turbulence when
you push a burn over.

221
00:14:39,576 --> 00:14:44,548
This week on Adventures with Bill Bill's
going to show us all about camping lanterns.

222
00:14:47,217 --> 00:14:49,486
That's next week could be car repair.

223
00:14:50,254 --> 00:14:51,755
Anyway, Bill Bright, all look at all the
equipment.

224
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:53,390
He's got there, all different kinds of
lights.

225
00:14:53,724 --> 00:14:54,892
That's just kind of a normal one.

226
00:14:54,892 --> 00:14:58,095
And this is kind of a little higher voltage,
pretty bright light.

227
00:14:58,095 --> 00:14:58,896
There's kind of focus

228
00:14:58,929 --> 00:14:59,329
Home

229
00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:02,900
As opposed to bill. It was not.

230
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,737
Look at the size of that thing isn't I've
never seen a flashlight like that in my life.

231
00:15:06,737 --> 00:15:08,739
And Bill says, Take the hand off there.

232
00:15:08,739 --> 00:15:12,643
I was left hand or right hand because she
was cross red, so that's kind of a bit of

233
00:15:12,643 --> 00:15:15,512
both. Bill's opening the batteries in the
plastic package.

234
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:22,219
Now they're open and it goes down and gets
the battery or two.

235
00:15:22,219 --> 00:15:24,521
And look, you can got de cells in there.

236
00:15:24,521 --> 00:15:27,991
It doesn't matter, apparently, which way you
put them in, up or down, you know, the plus

237
00:15:27,991 --> 00:15:30,360
or minus whatever. Just fire them all in
there.

238
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:36,200
It's kind of an unusual rig this one, and it
takes all the different sizes, the CS and I

239
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,904
think even the double A's, they go in side
by side kind of a Noah's Ark kind of a look

240
00:15:40,904 --> 00:15:42,005
to the flashlight at that point.

241
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:43,607
And what else you got there?

242
00:15:43,774 --> 00:15:46,109
And I check that I'll just check that out on
my dog again.

243
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,344
Yeah, that one's fine.

244
00:15:47,344 --> 00:15:49,947
Grab that one in there. And well, it's
pretty.

245
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:53,850
Oh. Oh.

246
00:15:57,454 --> 00:16:01,625
Maybe you should have thought that one
through a bill, and they were also put the

247
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:05,329
cap back on there and how I'm going to hand
her back to Bill, he's going to turn her on.

248
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:06,496
This is going to be pretty great. I would
think.

249
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:10,434
Do right, perhaps.

250
00:16:11,034 --> 00:16:12,069
But he's got something else here.

251
00:16:12,102 --> 00:16:16,473
This is one of these camp oil still oil
lengths, and I got the instructions and I

252
00:16:16,473 --> 00:16:19,776
say, Bill, you got to read the instructions
first because you know, something dangerous

253
00:16:19,776 --> 00:16:26,616
could happen. Like that, I hear something I
thought was really interesting.

254
00:16:26,683 --> 00:16:29,786
They could penknife you, open up the blade
there and you stick a candle on there and you

255
00:16:29,786 --> 00:16:33,323
stick it into a tree and you set up a bunch
of these through the forest and you make

256
00:16:33,323 --> 00:16:36,460
yourself a little path or a little campsite
at night is fantastic.

257
00:16:36,593 --> 00:16:37,461
Oh, bill bill ow

258
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:45,635
Ow ow ow ow ow ow.

259
00:16:47,971 --> 00:16:53,877
Oh, very good balance for older fellow and
surprise his breath, put that out.

260
00:16:54,578 --> 00:17:00,150
All right. This is kind of a gas propane
pressurized with the wick in there and is

261
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,754
though gas is down to me, I would have
thought, you know, what you want to do is

262
00:17:03,754 --> 00:17:07,824
light the match first and then and then, you
know, during the gas, well, you know, that's

263
00:17:07,824 --> 00:17:08,892
that's me. That's me.

264
00:17:08,892 --> 00:17:10,560
That's not Bill. That's not Bill's way.

265
00:17:11,428 --> 00:17:14,397
And oh what? Oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh.

266
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:17,501
Yeah. Oh.

267
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:22,606
Now where he buys his matches, but he had
the waterproof matches in a separate

268
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:25,509
container, but the name of the bill, he
doesn't keep things very long.

269
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:32,816
I don't know why that is. Hopefully he's got
yeah, he had a lighter one, a little flicking

270
00:17:32,816 --> 00:17:35,185
lighters thing or that gold belt.

271
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,021
Another one, yeah. All right.

272
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:41,992
Just go for a guy who doesn't smoke, he
carries a lot of firepower and he's going to

273
00:17:41,992 --> 00:17:48,565
light this up and. Wow.

274
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:50,467
That's a good look for you, Bill.

275
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,770
The Arnold Schwarzenegger The Terminator.

276
00:17:56,072 --> 00:18:01,378
Oh, well, we got a laugh out of it, Harold
tells me.

277
00:18:01,378 --> 00:18:04,481
There's a lot of young people watch the
show, and he wanted to do something just for

278
00:18:04,481 --> 00:18:06,416
you. Lucky you.

279
00:18:08,652 --> 00:18:10,020
Hello and welcome to.

280
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,590
Welcome to what is with that cheesy music.

281
00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:23,466
Oh oh, oh oh.

282
00:18:26,002 --> 00:18:28,104
Welcome to what's wrong with those goofy
adults.

283
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,946
This is a part of the show that's aimed at
the younger generation.

284
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,549
The cool people missed that part of the
show.

285
00:18:39,816 --> 00:18:43,620
We get to tell our parents and their
teachers in that really smelly guys, you a

286
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:50,126
kid, what really ticks us off, you know,
things like cheesy music or or homework or

287
00:18:50,126 --> 00:18:55,832
cauliflower or, you know, getting a cardigan
for your birthday or, oh, wow.

288
00:18:56,199 --> 00:18:59,068
Oh, you know. You know, what's the worst
when you've got to sit around the house and

289
00:18:59,068 --> 00:19:02,972
the whole family sits there and tries to
figure out who you look like the most, right?

290
00:19:03,173 --> 00:19:04,474
Not being able to wear your clothes
backwards.

291
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:08,244
People saying how handsome you're going to
be when your skin clears up.

292
00:19:08,878 --> 00:19:10,580
Please stop hating life, right?

293
00:19:10,713 --> 00:19:12,649
So this is our opportunity to say, well, no.

294
00:19:17,554 --> 00:19:20,023
Or having your show canceled after the first
episode.

295
00:19:22,992 --> 00:19:24,527
You still got that headache, do you, uncle
read?

296
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:29,933
That's a yes.

297
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:40,276
I figured Reg Thunder could help us with the
trees in the syrup because he's a vegetarian

298
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,912
reg, I want to ask you, is the sap any good?

299
00:19:43,346 --> 00:19:44,981
Oh, that's the best part.

300
00:19:45,648 --> 00:19:47,584
The sap is the blood of the tree.

301
00:19:47,617 --> 00:19:50,286
It's got everything good and it comes in a
liquid concentrate.

302
00:19:50,486 --> 00:19:54,057
So that's why trees can grow hundreds of
feet high and people can't get the whole.

303
00:19:57,126 --> 00:19:59,929
Oh, oh, yes.

304
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:10,473
Yes. It must have been doing the.

305
00:20:14,944 --> 00:20:22,185
Oh, you know, Reg, I think I'm just going to
stay behind you here.

306
00:20:23,386 --> 00:20:27,757
What exactly are we hunting today, you know,
just so our viewers will know.

307
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,262
Oh, we're hunting an animal.

308
00:20:33,796 --> 00:20:34,931
It makes this sound.

309
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,369
Oh, no idea what that is, right?

310
00:20:41,304 --> 00:20:43,306
Neither do I, but I bet I can put a bullet in
it.

311
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:53,850
Wow, it was unfortunate the sugaring often
didn't really go so well.

312
00:20:55,084 --> 00:20:56,419
There's a major understatement.

313
00:20:58,321 --> 00:21:04,060
Well, the first part went OK, and we hooked
Junior's pump up to about 50 trees and then

314
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,095
we switched it on in about 15 seconds.

315
00:21:06,095 --> 00:21:07,230
That sucked them all dry.

316
00:21:09,031 --> 00:21:11,100
Forty foot oak trees imploding.

317
00:21:12,435 --> 00:21:15,404
You have seen it. You don't look like you
look so cool.

318
00:21:15,605 --> 00:21:19,008
No, look, it looked like the wicked witch of
the West in The Wizard of Oz, you know, I

319
00:21:19,442 --> 00:21:24,213
think. I'll get you on your little dog, too.

320
00:21:26,015 --> 00:21:27,216
Oh, you bet.

321
00:21:30,086 --> 00:21:35,591
Oh. Oh.

322
00:21:38,628 --> 00:21:40,396
If he only had a brain.

323
00:21:44,267 --> 00:21:47,970
Anyway, it was really something to see
full-Grown birch trees shrinking right back

324
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:52,408
down to saplings and even the even the
leaves were kind of curling up and rolling up

325
00:21:52,408 --> 00:21:53,109
the branches.

326
00:21:53,242 --> 00:21:54,644
But the worst part? Oh no, no.

327
00:21:54,644 --> 00:21:58,848
Let me say the worst part was worse.

328
00:21:58,914 --> 00:22:00,883
For worse part was like the noise.

329
00:22:01,183 --> 00:22:02,351
It was amazing.

330
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:05,821
Sounded like God flushed every toilet in
heaven all at once.

331
00:22:07,623 --> 00:22:08,824
Now how would you know that, Harold?

332
00:22:08,858 --> 00:22:11,394
Have you ever heard all of the toilets and
having a flash at the same time?

333
00:22:11,727 --> 00:22:14,530
No. Well, if you keep interrupting, you
will.

334
00:22:18,901 --> 00:22:20,136
Sorry. All right.

335
00:22:20,403 --> 00:22:27,176
As I was saying, the worst part was the
sound, it sounded like a big noise or some

336
00:22:27,176 --> 00:22:29,845
kind heavenly toilet thing, I guess.

337
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:34,517
And and then the roots, the roots, the roots
came up through the right through the ground

338
00:22:34,517 --> 00:22:37,153
and they shriveled up and they started
rolling out and they went down through the

339
00:22:37,153 --> 00:22:38,320
hoses and into the pump.

340
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,557
And I'll tell you, we would have been real
scared if we weren't laughing so hard.

341
00:22:42,491 --> 00:22:47,430
Boy, was the fire the possum that's meeting
time for I'm going to go, Harold.

342
00:22:47,563 --> 00:22:50,299
Yes, telling guys at the pancake branches on
hold.

343
00:22:51,534 --> 00:22:52,434
I would think so.

344
00:22:53,369 --> 00:23:00,109
Well, you know, I think we have all learned a
life lesson this week, which is never connect

345
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:03,679
a used Russian rocket fuel pump to a large
deciduous tree.

346
00:23:04,513 --> 00:23:07,850
And if my wife is watching, you know, I
think maybe you should embroider that little

347
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:11,820
snippet of wisdom onto one of them samplers,
and we'll hang that in the cube over there.

348
00:23:11,854 --> 00:23:12,888
Look kind of nice, actually.

349
00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:17,059
I'll be coming home straight after the
meeting and I can help you spell deciduous.

350
00:23:17,693 --> 00:23:23,732
There's at least one in and the rest of you
on behalf of myself and Harold and the whole

351
00:23:23,732 --> 00:23:25,334
gang up here at Possum Lodge.

352
00:23:25,568 --> 00:23:27,636
Thanks for watching and keep your stick on
the ice.

353
00:23:56,298 --> 00:24:02,538
Very exciting to me, but I need everybody's
help here to rebuild the parks and.
