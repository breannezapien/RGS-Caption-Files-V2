1
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:09,409
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

2
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:12,412
COMING TO YOU DIRECTLY
FROM POSSUM LODGE

3
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:15,648
WHERE EVERY DAYS IS LIKE
TAKING A VACATION,

4
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:17,317
FROM REALITY, THAT IS.

5
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:19,486
HERE'S THE STAR OF OUR SHOW,

6
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:21,154
MY UNCLE, RED GREEN!

7
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:24,324
[applause]

8
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:30,630
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

9
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,565
THIS IS AN EXCITING DAY.

10
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:34,634
FIRST DAY OF TROUT SEASON.

11
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,170
OH, I HATE TROUT SEASON.

12
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:38,671
I HATE THAT.

13
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:41,241
FISHING SHOWS MAKE
BAD TELEVISION.

14
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:43,043
THIS IS A FISHING SHOW.

15
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:44,544
IT IS?

16
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,046
YEAH.

17
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:47,514
THAT EXPLAINS THE RATINGS.

18
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,215
PICTURE THIS, UNCLE RED.

19
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:53,019
YOU AND A BUNCH OF GUYS
IN A CANOE WAITING FOR A TROUT

20
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:54,888
TO BITE A RUBBER MINNOW.

21
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:56,389
NOT DYNAMIC IMAGERY.

22
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:59,159
ALL RIGHT, HAROLD,
PICTURE THIS.

23
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,962
YOU WEARING A PAPER HAT
MAKING FRENCH FRIES.

24
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:05,098
[audience laughing]

25
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:10,170
[horns honking]

26
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:13,540
[geese honking]

27
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,410
[quacking]

28
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:23,483
ON TODAY'S SHOW, I'LL SHOW YOU
HOW TO MAKE A TACKLE BOX.

29
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,985
RANGER GORD HAS MADE SANDWICHES.

30
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:27,487
I DON'T ASK.

31
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:28,988
MIKE RELATES HIS

32
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:31,491
PRISON EXPERIENCE TO REALITY.

33
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:34,561
DOUGIE TELLS US
HOW TO GET WOMEN.

34
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,534
FISHING SEASON
STARTED THIS MORNING.

35
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,269
WE'VE HAD OUR FIRST ARREST.

36
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:45,205
BEFORE THE SUN WAS EVEN UP,

37
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,975
BOB STUYVESANT FROM THE
MINISTRY OF NATURAL RESOURCES

38
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,477
FINED JUNIOR SINGLETON

39
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:53,046
AND CONFISCATED
HIS FISHING EQUIPMENT.

40
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,715
HE TRADED A '78 BUICK LeSABRE

41
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,217
FOR
THAT STUFF.

42
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,985
NOT HIS FISHING GEAR.

43
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,154
JUST THE AIRCRAFT LIGHTS.

44
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:02,655
AIRCRAFT
LIGHTS?

45
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:07,026
JUNIOR HAD LIGHTS ON THE BOAT
POINTING INTO THE WATER.

46
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:08,528
IS THAT ILLEGAL?

47
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,864
YEAH, IT'S CALLED
UNFAIR ADVANTAGE.

48
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,866
BRIGHT LIGHTS ATTRACT FISH.

49
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,367
AND GOVERNMENT AGENTS.

50
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,869
[laughing]

51
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:18,104
IS JUNIOR IN A LOT OF TROUBLE?

52
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,606
THAT'S BETWEEN JUNIOR

53
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:22,175
AND THE MINISTRY
OF NATURAL RESOURCES.

54
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,677
WHERE DID HE GET
AIRCRAFT LIGHTS?

55
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:27,680
THAT'S BETWEEN JUNIOR AND
THE MINISTRY OF TRANSPORTATION.

56
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:30,016
AIRPLANES SHOULDN'T FLY
AT NIGHT.

57
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,518
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

58
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,520
WELL, IT IS NOW.

59
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:35,522
[laughing]

60
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:38,191
(Red): LATER, WE'LL
PRACTISE CASTING

61
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,692
GETTING READY FOR --

62
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,194
OH, BOY.

63
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,530
DROPPED YOUR SINKERS
AND EVERYTHING.

64
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,031
PICKING 'EM UP.

65
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:48,801
OH, OH, BILL, GOT ALL
THE LURES SNAGGED INTO YOU.

66
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:51,004
I GUESS YOU CAUGHT YOURSELF.

67
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,072
I'M NOT GOING TO CLEAN YA.

68
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,608
OK, THIS IS FOR

69
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:59,078
TWO HOURS WITH A WRECKING BALL
FROM McCLINTOCK SALVAGE.

70
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:02,081
YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO GET MR. HAMAR

71
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:04,284
TO SAY THIS WORD.

72
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,654
THIRTY SECONDS.

73
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,155
BEGIN.

74
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:12,192
ALL RIGHT, MIKE,
UH, PROMISE.

75
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:13,793
DEATH THREAT?

76
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,295
[laughing]

77
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,529
DEDICATION.

78
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:19,332
HABITUAL OFFENDER?

79
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,134
CONVICTION.

80
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,269
APPEAL?

81
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,672
[laughing]

82
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,273
UM... HONOUR.

83
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,076
AMONGST THIEVES.

84
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,678
[laughing]

85
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:35,848
NOW, MIKE, WHEN A MAN AND WOMAN
PLEDGE THEIR LOYALTY,

86
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,884
THAT'S CALLED MAKING A...

87
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,919
CONJUGAL VISIT.

88
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:44,190
[laughing]

89
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,595
OH, SHE HAD A RIFLE
ON HER DRESSER 

90
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,330
A SHOTGUN ON THE FLOOR 

91
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,666
A PISTOL IN HER PILLOW
AND AN UZI BY THE DOOR 

92
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,036
SHE HAD ENOUGH ARTILLERY
TO START A CONFLAGRATION 

93
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,538
AND WHEN SHE THREW
HER ARMS AROUND YOU 

94
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:01,674
YOU WERE PRETTY MUCH
THERE FOR THE DURATION 

95
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,247
WITH THIS BEING THE START
OF TROUT SEASON,

96
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,015
I GOT OUT MY FISHING GEAR.

97
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,650
THERE'S A LOT, BUT, HEY,

98
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,151
I NEED IT ALL,

99
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,654
'CAUSE WHEN I GO,
I WANT TO STAY GONE.

100
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:17,690
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO
KEEP GOING HOME

101
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:21,327
FOR ANOTHER HOOK, OR MORE BAIT
OR ANOTHER ROD,

102
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:24,163
OR MAGAZINES, OR ICE,
OR SANDWICHES,

103
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,667
OR MY EIGHT TRACKS,
OR ANY OF MY FISHING GEAR.

104
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,937
THIS WEEK I'LL SHOW YOU
HOW WE CAN MAKE HIP WADERS

105
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,906
THAT WILL HOLD
ALL OF YOUR FISHING EQUIPMENT.

106
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:37,477
HOPEFULLY YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO
STEP ON DRY LAND AGAIN.

107
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:41,014
THE PRIME COMPONENT
IS ONE OF THESE WADING POOLS.

108
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,616
I GOT THIS ONE FROM
JUNIOR SINGLETON.

109
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:47,020
THERE'S A HOLE IN IT
FROM A GAME OF LAWN DARTS.

110
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:50,323
FIRST, CUT A HOLE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOTTOM,

111
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,959
THAT'S THE SAME CIRCUMFERENCE
YOU ARE

112
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,128
IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR BOTTOM.

113
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:57,130
THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.

114
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:59,198
I'LL ROUND IT OFF.

115
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:21,187
ONCE YOU GOT THE HOLE CUT
THE SIZE OF YOU,

116
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:24,223
DUCT TAPE
SOME SHOULDER STRAPS IN THERE

117
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,925
MADE OF... DUCT TAPE.

118
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,329
AND JUST PULL THE UNIT
UP ONTO YOUR SHOULDERS.

119
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,265
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL THEM
SHOULDER STRAPS.

120
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,000
AND THERE WE GO.

121
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:38,671
WE'LL HAVE TO SEPARATE
THIS POOL INTO COMPARTMENTS.

122
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:42,608
FOR THAT, I SUGGEST
A PIECE OF VINYL SIDING.

123
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,011
JUST PEEL IT OFF OF
SOMEBODY'S HOUSE

124
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,580
WHILE SOMETHING ELSE LOUD
IS GOING ON,

125
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,716
LIKE, SAY, AN ELECTRICAL STORM.

126
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:52,418
JUST BE SURE TO WEAR
RUBBER-SOLED SHOES.

127
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:55,621
YOU WANT TO BEND THIS
TO FIT INSIDE.

128
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,990
I SUPPOSE YOU COULD
MEASURE THIS,

129
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,326
BUT WHO HAS THAT KIND OF TIME?

130
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:22,882
ALL RIGHT, I GOT HER
SEPARATED INTO COMPARTMENTS.

131
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,284
I'VE GOT MY FAVOURITE POP HERE.

132
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,487
I GOT THE BAIT IN THIS AREA.

133
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,988
GOT SOME SANDWICHES.

134
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,091
AND GOT SOME TOOLS
IN THIS AREA.

135
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,494
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHEN YOU'LL NEED 'EM.

136
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,497
I'VE ADDED SIGNS
SO YOU CAN TELL WHAT'S WHAT,

137
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,299
'CAUSE ON A HOT DAY,
THE SUN BEATING DOWN,

138
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:44,036
IT'S DIFFICULT TO TELL THE BAIT
FROM THE TUNA CASSEROLE.

139
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,838
THAT WAS NOT A FUN DAY.

140
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,441
NO WONDER THE FISH
WEREN'T BITING.

141
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:52,612
AROUND BACK, I'VE GOT
MY FIRST AID, MY MAGAZINES--

142
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:55,114
ALL RIGHT,
I CAN'T SEEM TO ACCESS

143
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,816
THE STUFF IN THE BACK.

144
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,485
WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL
A DESIGN FLAW.

145
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,921
THIS WILL TAKE
A MAJOR RE-THINK.

146
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,657
ALL RIGHT,
GET YOURSELF A HARD HAT.

147
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,093
DRIVE A SPIKE UP THROUGH THAT.

148
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,564
WE'VE ALL DONE IT THE OTHER WAY
A FEW TIMES, HAVEN'T WE?

149
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,299
TAKE A ROLL OF DUCT TAPE.

150
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,368
STICK THAT ON
AS YOUR BEARING.

151
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,971
PROBABLY YOU'VE NOTICED THAT
THIS IS AN ARMY HELMET.

152
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,508
I GOT IT FROM THE POSSUM LODGE
LITTLE THEATRE GROUP

153
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:25,378
WHEN "ALL QUIET ON
THE WESTERN FRONT" BOMBED.

154
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,480
"BOMBED" IS A LITTLE STRONG.

155
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:30,016
"SELF-DESTRUCTED"
IS MORE ACCURATE.

156
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,885
I ADDED SOME STRAPPING
SO THESE ARE LONGER.

157
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,288
I GOT A HOLE
AT THE CRISS-CROSS.

158
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,089
TRY TO LINE HER UP WITH

159
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:39,992
THE SPIKE --
GET THAT IN THERE.

160
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,596
AND THERE YOU GO.

161
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,598
HUH, HUH, HUH, HUH?

162
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,099
LOOK AT THAT.

163
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,634
HUH, HUH?

164
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,136
NOW WE'RE FISHIN'.

165
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,171
IT'S JUST LIKE A LAZY SUSAN.

166
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:55,541
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

167
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:58,110
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

168
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,112
I'M GOING FISHIN'.

169
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,515
OH BOY, OH BOY, OH BOY.

170
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,286
RANGER GORD GIVES THE TOWER

171
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:08,688
A COAT OF PAINT.

172
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,029
BOB STUYVESANT
JUST ARRESTED STINKY PETERSON.

173
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,565
IT'S THE FIRST DAY
OF TROUT SEASON

174
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:23,569
AND THE ONLY THING REELED IN
ARE POSSUM LODGE MEMBERS.

175
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:27,240
DOES STINKY QUALIFY AS
A LARGE-MOUTH OR A SUCKER?

176
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,741
WALL-EYE ACTUALLY.

177
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:31,210
STINKY WAS FISHING AT
ROCK REEF POINT

178
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,313
BY CHUCKING STICKS OF
DYNAMITE INTO THE WATER.

179
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,982
APPARENTLY THAT'S ILLEGAL, TOO.

180
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:39,085
THEY'RE SO STRICT
ABOUT THOSE KIND OF THINGS.

181
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,754
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO CATCH UNARMED FISH

182
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,123
WITH EXPLOSIVES
OR NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

183
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:49,195
IT'S PUT A DAMPER ON
SPORT FISHING EVERYWHERE.

184
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,364
IS THAT SARCASM, HAROLD?

185
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,834
NOT IF I HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT.

186
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,737
IS IT SARCASM
OR NOT?

187
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:00,239
GO FISH.

188
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,042
[laughing]

189
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,779
AN IMPORTANT PART OF
THE FOREST RANGER'S JOB

190
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,415
IS RESCUING LOST CAMPERS
AND HIKERS.

191
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,083
THE FOREST IS OUR FRIEND.

192
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,219
BUT MANY PEOPLE ENTER THE FOREST

193
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,354
UNAWARE OF
ITS POTENTIAL DANGERS.

194
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,356
BABES IN THE WOODS, RIGHT?

195
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:18,858
BABES?

196
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,359
THERE'S BABES HERE?

197
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:21,861
BABES, WHOA, WHOA!

198
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,362
OW, OW, WHOO!

199
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:24,864
BABES, BABES, BABES!

200
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,866
WHERE?

201
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,701
IT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION.

202
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:31,604
GETTING BACK TO
YOUR EARLIER STATEMENT.

203
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,873
YOU'VE BEEN UP HERE 16 YEARS.

204
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,877
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE YOU
RESCUED FROM THE WOODS?

205
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,880
UH, YOU MEAN ALTOGETHER,
IN A BUNCH?

206
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,381
HOW MANY, ROUGHLY?

207
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,883
ALL TOTALLED UP?

208
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,886
I DON'T THINK THE NUMBERS
ARE IMPORTANT.

209
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,387
SO IT'S NONE.

210
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,222
YEAH, BUT I'M READY.

211
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:53,059
FOR EXAMPLE, I HAVE
A LIGHT SANDWICH TABLE.

212
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:56,262
IT'S LIGHT BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S
BEEN LOST FOR WEEKS

213
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,899
AND YOU GIVE THEM A HEAVY MEAL,
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.

214
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,400
[gagging]

215
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,402
ALL RIGHT, WE UNDERSTAND.

216
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:06,505
I'M EVEN GOING TO
CUT THE CRUSTS OFF

217
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:09,408
TO MAKE THEM EVEN MORE
DIGESTIBLE.

218
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:10,910
THEY LOOK GREAT.

219
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,411
THANKS.

220
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:15,414
I HAVE A NICE PUNCH
FOR A BIT OF A MIXER.

221
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:18,684
WE'LL PASS OUT NAME TAGS,
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER,

222
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,720
WHERE YOU'RE FROM,
WHAT YOU DO,

223
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,623
HOW MANY PEOPLE IN YOUR PARTY
PRESUMED DEAD,

224
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:27,460
HOW MANY PEOPLE
YOU KNOW PERSONALLY,

225
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,362
LIKE REALLY KNOW?

226
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:32,031
THEN IT'S TIME FOR
RANGER GORD'S CHILLI,

227
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,466
AND ALL I CAN SAY IS

228
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:36,369
THANK GOODNESS WE'RE OUTSIDE
FOR THAT ONE.

229
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:37,870
[laughing]

230
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,806
THEN IT'S TIME FOR TEA
AND DESSERT.

231
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:44,877
THEN, TO HELP THEM ASSIMILATE
BACK INTO CIVILIZATION,

232
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,379
WE'LL PLAY CHARADES.

233
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,880
CHARADES, GORD?

234
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,950
GORD, GORD, GORD,
YOU GOT PEOPLE IN THE WOODS.

235
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:54,020
THEY HAVEN'T HAD FOOD
OR SHELTER FOR A WHILE.

236
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:56,222
THEY COULD HAVE
MEDICAL PROBLEMS.

237
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:58,891
THERE COULD BE DEHYDRATION,
HYPOTHERMIA.

238
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,395
IT MIGHT TAKE THEM A WEEK
TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET.

239
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,896
A WEEK?

240
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,398
YEAH, A WEEK.

241
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:06,899
WOW.

242
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,901
A WEEK OUT HERE.

243
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,837
OH GEEZ,
WE COULD HAVE CAMPFIRES,

244
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:15,908
MAKE GIMP BRACELETS,
SING SONGS, PANTY RAIDS.

245
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,911
OH, COME ON, GORD.

246
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,413
WHO AM I KIDDING?

247
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,848
NOBODY EVER GETS LOST
AROUND HERE.

248
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,216
I DON'T KNOW, GORD.

249
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,919
YOU SEEM PRETTY MUCH OUT THERE
TO ME.

250
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:31,323
WELCOME TO
HAROLD'S HANDICRAFTS

251
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,927
WHERE CRAFTY HANDS
MAKE HANDI-CRAFTS.

252
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:39,365
TODAY WE'LL BE MAKING
A COUNTRY KITCHEN CLOCK.

253
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:40,866
WA-HA-HA-HA.

254
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,368
ALL RIGHT.

255
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:47,039
FIRST, AS ALWAYS, STEP ONE,
GATHER UP SOME SCRAPS OF WOOD.

256
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,708
THAT WOULD BE THESE.

257
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,077
NAIL THEM TOGETHER
AND YOU GET

258
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:54,380
A LOVELY HOUSING
FOR THE CLOCK MECHANISM.

259
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:57,049
TAKE A COUPLE
AND NAIL THEM TOGETHER.

260
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,385
THAT WILL BE THE CLOCK HOUSING.

261
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,388
WE WON'T USE THAT ONE.

262
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,889
THAT'S GONNA -- AH!

263
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,424
OK,

264
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,395
THERE.

265
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:10,930
ISN'T THAT ATTRACTIVE?

266
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,399
[laughing]

267
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:17,403
[applause]

268
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,405
AND IT'S STURDY, TOO.

269
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,842
WE'LL LET THAT GLUE DRY.

270
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:26,912
AND NOW IT'S TIME TO WORK ON
THE CLOCK MECHANISM.

271
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,849
FOR THAT,
YOU'LL HAVE TO BUY A KIT.

272
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,350
THAT'S IN HERE.

273
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,853
THERE'S EVERYTHING IN HERE.

274
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,855
YOU'VE GOT THE WINDINGS.

275
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,857
THERE'S A DARK THING.

276
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,358
AND STUFF.

277
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,160
LOOK AT ALL THIS STUFF.

278
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,829
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT YOU NEED.

279
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,865
WO-HO-HO-HO.

280
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,366
OK, THERE'S EVERYTHING

281
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,936
YOU'RE GOING TO
POSSIBLY NEED IN HERE.

282
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,374
EXCEPT THE INSTRUCTIONS.

283
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,876
BUT THAT'S OK.

284
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:01,447
THAT'S OK BECAUSE WE CAN
ONLY HOPE THAT IT'S LOGICAL.

285
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,886
THERE YOU HAVE IT.

286
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,388
A LOVELY COUNTRY CLOCK FACE.

287
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,891
OF COURSE,
YOU HAVE THE MECHANISMS.

288
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,392
THAT'S INTRICATE.

289
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,895
WE WON'T GET INTO THAT
THIS WEEK.

290
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:19,131
THEN YOU SIMPLY INSERT
THE CLOCK MECHANISM

291
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:22,168
INTO THE PREVIOUSLY-CONSTRUCTED
HOUSING.

292
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,669
ALL RIGHTY.

293
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,171
THERE YOU HAVE IT.

294
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,673
YOU'RE VERY OWN COUNTRY CLOCK.

295
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,609
[laughing]

296
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:34,680
AND YOU KNOW, THE BEST PART IS
YOU MADE IT YOURSELF.

297
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,215
EVERY YEAR COME SPRING,

298
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:39,051
IT'S TIME TO PAINT
THE OLD WATCH-TOWER.

299
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,753
A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT SAY

300
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,690
"THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF WORK
PAINTING ALL THOSE STAIRS."

301
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,392
BUT, IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

302
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,027
HERE, LET ME SHOW YOU.

303
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:51,864
WE'LL START WITH A PRIMER COAT.

304
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:57,203
[paint sloshing]

305
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,205
AND ONCE THAT'S DONE,

306
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:00,706
WE'LL START WITH

307
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,208
THE FIRST COAT.

308
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:10,883
[paint sloshing]

309
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,384
YUP.

310
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,353
AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE NEED

311
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,888
A SECOND COAT HERE.

312
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:24,830
[Paint sloshing)

313
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,332
THERE WE GO.

314
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:27,900
THE JOB'S DONE.

315
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,003
OH GEE, SORRY, RED,

316
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,839
I DIDN'T SEE YOU
COMING UP THERE.

317
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,008
GEEZ.

318
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:40,546
TWO MORE LODGE MEMBERS WERE
ARRESTED FOR ILLEGAL FISHING.

319
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:43,349
THIS RED TAPE
IS KILLING THE SPORT.

320
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:44,850
EVERYBODY'S TICKED OFF.

321
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,953
THE GUYS ON THE SPANISH TRAWLER
ARE THINKING OF LEAVING.

322
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,989
[laughing]

323
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,024
THE COPS PICKED UP
MOOSE THOMPSON

324
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,525
FOR POISONING FISH.

325
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,961
WHO WANTS TO EAT POISON FISH?

326
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,663
HE USES BENZENE, HAROLD.

327
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,199
SO IT ALL BURNS OFF
WHEN YOU COOK IT.

328
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:04,003
IT TASTES LIKE THE FISH
WAS COOKED IN AUSTRALIAN WINE.

329
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,606
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
JUST FISH THE NORMAL WAY?

330
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:11,210
WELL, BUSTER HADFIELD
WAS FINED AND ARRESTED,

331
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:14,580
AND HE WAS FISHING WITH
A HOOK AND A LINE.

332
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:18,384
A GRAPPLING HOOK
AND A HIGH-TENSION POWER LINE!

333
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,386
ANYBODY USING A METAL LURE

334
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:23,322
HAD MOST OF THEIR BODY HAIR
BURNED OFF.

335
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:26,325
PEOPLE PAY TO HAVE
THEIR BODY HAIR REMOVED.

336
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,694
WHAT HAPPENS IF
I LOSE MY EYEBROWS

337
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,496
AND THEY DON'T GROW BACK?

338
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:32,331
YOU COULD BE
A FEMALE IMPERSONATOR

339
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,199
INSTEAD OF A MALE IMPERSONATOR.

340
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,403
[laughing and applause)

341
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:42,107
MEANWHILE, BACK AT
THE CASTING CONTEST --

342
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:45,344
THAT'S A HECK OF A LURE
YOU GOT ON THERE, BILL.

343
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:48,347
BILL AND I ARE
WARMING UP OUR SKILLS.

344
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,815
WE HAD A BUCKET.

345
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,317
IT WAS CLOSE.

346
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:52,818
YEAH, IT'S CLOSE.

347
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,254
YOU GIVE IT A TRY,
BIG MOUTH.

348
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:56,755
NO, NOT THAT WAY.

349
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,691
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

350
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,759
THERE'S AN UNUSUAL TECHNIQUE.

351
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,928
SO HE TRIES HER AGAIN.

352
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,563
RIGHT IN.

353
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,865
NO, BILL, NO -- OH.

354
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:10,803
YOU KNOW, THIS IS SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD DO ON YOUR OWN,

355
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,272
ESPECIALLY WHEN
YOU'RE WITH BILL.

356
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,140
HIS REEL'S ALL JAMMED UP

357
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:18,744
'CAUSE HE BOUGHT
THE ROD AND REEL FOR 99 CENTS,

358
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,245
BRAND NEW.

359
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,381
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

360
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,783
THERE'S NO FISHING GEAR
IN THERE.

361
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,620
THERE'S NO FISHING GEAR
IN THERE, YOU DUMB, BIG...

362
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,122
WHAT'S GOING ON?

363
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,391
THAT'S A WRENCH.

364
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,126
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

365
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,328
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?

366
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,564
THAT'S MY STARTING MOTOR.

367
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,834
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH
MY STARTING MOTOR?

368
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,869
WHAT'S THE PLAN?

369
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,638
HE'LL USE THAT
AS A FISHING REEL.

370
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:49,341
LATER THAT DAY
THE SUN CAME OUT.

371
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:52,177
HE GOT A HOLD OF THAT ONE,
DIDN'T HE?

372
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:53,879
LOOK AT THAT BABY GO.

373
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,848
LOOK OUT FOR THE WIRES.

374
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:58,183
OH BOY, OH BOY, OH BOY.

375
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,420
HE'S GOT THE STEEL LINE
ON THERE, TOO.

376
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,988
HOW DOES THAT FEEL?

377
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:06,525
WHAT HAPPENS NOW IS,
UNFORTUNATELY, I GUESS,

378
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:10,362
THE STARTING MOTOR
STARTED WINDING THE LINE IN,

379
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,897
AND BILL'S GONE.

380
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,966
HE'S NOT WINDING THE LINE IN.

381
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,201
HE'S WINDING BILL
UP TO THE LINE.

382
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:17,569
LOOK OUT, BILL!

383
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,071
OH, OH.

384
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:21,140
GOSH, THAT WAS--

385
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,541
[laughing]

386
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,411
AND UP HE GOES.

387
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,280
BUT, HEY,
ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL.

388
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:31,417
SHOULD HAVE SEEN
THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY.

389
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:34,386
STAY TUNED WHILE I ADJUST
MY FISH FINDER.

390
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,360
WELL, I'VE HAD IT.

391
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,362
BOB STUYVESANT JUST CONFISCATED

392
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:46,765
ALL MY FISHING EQUIPMENT
RIGHT OUT OF MY BOAT.

393
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,168
WHAT WOULD GIVE HIM THE RIGHT
TO TAKE MY STUFF?

394
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,071
IT'S HIS STUFF --
YOU BORROWED IT LAST YEAR.

395
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,774
IF THE GOVERNMENT
HAD THEIR WAY,

396
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,910
YOU KNOW WHAT FISHING
WOULD BE?

397
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:01,280
SITTING IN A BOAT
WITH A ROD, A REEL AND A LURE,

398
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,482
WAITING FOR SOME FISH
TO BITE IT.

399
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,151
THAT'S NOT A SPORT --
THAT'S GAMBLING.

400
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,153
WHY DON'T YOU USE
LEGAL EQUIPMENT,

401
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,655
LIKE A FISH FINDER?

402
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,824
YOU KNOW WHAT I'LL DO?

403
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,993
USE A FISH
FINDER?             USE A FISH
FINDER.

404
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,396
YOU KNOW WHY
I DIDN'T THINK OF THIS?

405
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,465
I WASTE TIME ARGUING WITH YOU.

406
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,333
I WON'T DO THAT ANY MORE.

407
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,869
EXCELLENT.

408
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,439
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT PORTION
OF THE SHOW.

409
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:30,476
ON THIS WEEK'S PORTION
WE HAVE MY UNCLE RED

410
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,011
AND HIS FRIEND,
MR. DOUGIE FRANKLIN.

411
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:36,415
[applause]

412
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:37,916
OK, HERE WE GO.

413
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:42,321
FIRST LETTER GOES AS FOLLOWS:
"DEAR EXPERTS"

414
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:45,624
"I FIND A CERTAIN WOMAN
VERY ATTRACTIVE,

415
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,359
"AND SHE SEEMS NICE.

416
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,027
"WHENEVER I TALK TO HER

417
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:52,264
"SHE MAKES A FACE
LIKE SOMETHING IS BURNING,

418
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,066
"THEN JUMPS INTO A TAXI.

419
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,567
"WHAT'S
THE DEAL?

420
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,069
"MR. LONELY."

421
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,471
NOT MUCH TO GO ON THERE.

422
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,407
MR. LONELY COULD BE
MR. LOSER.

423
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:07,045
OR MAYBE THE WOMAN
IS JUST PLAYING HARD TO GET.

424
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:10,149
WELL, NO, RED --
IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE,

425
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,718
WOMEN DON'T PLAY
HARD TO GET.

426
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,686
THEY ARE HARD TO GET.

427
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:18,490
[laughing]

428
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:22,060
YOU DON'T WALK UP TO A WOMAN
AND START A CONVERSATION.

429
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,562
YOU DRIVE UP.

430
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,063
THERE'S A HINT,

431
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,999
BOLD AS BRASS
IN THAT LETTER.

432
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,568
"SHE GOT INTO A TAXI."

433
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,069
HINT, HINT.

434
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:34,173
GET YOURSELF A SET OF WHEELS.

435
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:38,210
WHAT, LIKE YOUR MONSTER TRUCK,
MR. FRANKLIN?

436
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,879
'CAUSE PERSONALLY I FIND THAT
COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE.

437
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:44,750
WELL, DON'T YOU GO
KIDDING YOURSELF, HAROLD.

438
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,119
WOMEN LOVE A MONSTER TRUCK.

439
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,421
THEY LOVE THE POWER.

440
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,657
THEY LOVE THE SIZE.

441
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:56,728
WOMEN LOVE ALL THAT RUBBER.

442
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,497
YOU'RE UP IN THE TRUCK.

443
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,866
DON'T YOU NEED
SOMETHING SHORTER

444
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,101
TO MAKE THAT EYE-TO-EYE THING

445
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,904
THAT THEY RECOMMEND
IN THOSE MAGAZINES

446
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,406
THAT BERNICE BUYS?

447
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,541
YOU'RE ONTO SOMETHING, RED.

448
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,844
IF YOU TAKE THAT THOUGHT
A LITTLE FARTHER,

449
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:16,448
IT MIGHT BEHOVE YOU
WHEN YOU BUY YOUR VEHICLE

450
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,518
TO GET ONE THAT PUTS YOU
AT EYE LEVEL

451
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:23,121
OF WHATEVER IT IS
YOU WANT TO BE LOOKING AT

452
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,457
WHILE YOU'RE TALKING TO IT.

453
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,559
CATCH MY DRIFT?

454
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:31,129
AND ANOTHER THING,
POWER WINDOWS.

455
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:35,834
WOMEN LOVE A MAN THAT CAN
DRIVE UP SMOOTH AS CAN BE,

456
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:41,139
RAISE AND LOWER HIS WINDOWS
WITHOUT CRANKING AND WHEEZING.

457
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:43,308
YOU KNOW WHY?

458
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:47,079
IT MAKES 'EM THINK
YOU'RE GOOD WITH YOUR HANDS.

459
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:48,981
[laughing]

460
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,017
PROBLEM,
UNCLE RED?

461
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,086
THIS FISH FINDER'S USELESS.

462
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,088
MAYBE IT'S A LOOSE WIRE.

463
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,657
IS IT COVERED BY WARRANTY?

464
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,197
WAS IT COVERED BY WARRANTY?

465
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,433
I TOLD EVERYBODY THAT
FISH FINDERS WERE LEGAL.

466
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,336
SO EVERYBODY GOES
AND BUYS A FISH FINDER,

467
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,472
OR BORROWED ONE OR STOLE ONE.

468
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:16,475
WE MONITORED EVERY CUBIC INCH
OF POSSUM LAKE.

469
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,543
WE'D SEE EVERY FISH IN THE LAKE.

470
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,045
NOBODY SAW ANYTHING.

471
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,546
COMPLETELY BLANK SCREENS.

472
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,548
STINKY PETERSON TOLD US THAT

473
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:27,052
BOB STUYVESANT AND THE MINISTRY
OF NATURAL RESOURCES

474
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,521
MUST HAVE SENT OUT
A JAMMING SIGNAL.

475
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,290
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

476
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:33,792
NOT ONE FISH FINDER
REGISTERED FISH?

477
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,294
NO, SIR.

478
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,396
BEFORE THEY HAD
THEIR DYNAMITE, POISON

479
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,564
AND HIGH-VOLTAGE LINES
CONFISCATED,

480
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,967
DID ONE MEMBER CATCH A FISH?

481
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,702
NO -- WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

482
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,071
THERE ARE NO FISH
IN POSSUM LAKE!

483
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,073
POSSUM LAKE IS FISHLESS!

484
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,741
GOLLY, THAT'S A RELIEF.

485
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,243
A RELIEF?

486
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,079
NO, POSSUM LAKE IS
COMPLETELY LIFELESS.

487
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,082
HERE I THOUGHT
MY FISH FINDER WAS BROKEN.

488
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,084
ALL RIGHT, IT IS BROKEN.

489
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,420
BUT IT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER

490
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,522
ABOUT HAVING
THE EQUIPMENT CONFISCATED.

491
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:06,458
ACTUALLY, IT'S A JOKE
ON BOB STUYVESANT.

492
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:09,928
HE TOOK AWAY ALL OUR STUFF
TO PROTECT THE FISH,

493
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,530
AND THERE AREN'T ANY.

494
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:13,031
WHAT AN IDIOT!

495
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:14,533
[laughing]

496
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,034
[squealing]

497
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,536
IT'S MEETING TIME.

498
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,037
YOU GO AHEAD.

499
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,506
DON'T TELL THE GUYS
ABOUT THE NO-FISH.

500
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,709
I WANT TO GIVE THEM
THE GOOD NEWS.

501
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,644
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

502
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:28,547
I WON'T BE BRINGING
A MESS OF FISH.

503
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,816
I'LL STOP AT
THE TAKE-OUT PLACE.

504
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:33,952
THAT WAY WE DON'T HAVE TO
CUT THE HEADS OFF

505
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,823
OR PULL THE GUTS OUT,
UNLESS I GO TO THE CHEAP PLACE.

506
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:39,458
FOR THE REST OF YOU,

507
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:44,396
ON BEHALF OF HAROLD AND MYSELF
AND THE GANG AT POSSUM LODGE,

508
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,565
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

509
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:50,569
[applause]

510
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:52,070
[possum squeal]

511
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,805
(Harold): ALL RISE.

512
00:22:56,641 --> 00:23:02,080
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

513
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:04,983
(Harold): I INTERCEPTED
A MESSAGE.

514
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:10,489
THE MINISTRY OF TRANSPORTATION
IS DOING A SURPRISE INSPECTION.

515
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:16,495


516
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,597


517
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:20,499


518
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,833


519
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,669


520
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,538


521
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,613
