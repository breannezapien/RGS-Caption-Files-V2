IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT
EVOLUTION OVER THE
LAST MILLION YEARS,

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:09,376
THE ONE SPECIES THAT
HAS SURVIVED WITHOUT
ADAPTING IS MAN.

3
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:11,811
THAT'S BECAUSE AS SOON
AS HE PICKED UP ROCKS
AND STICKS,

4
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:13,480
HE REALIZED HE
COULD HIT THINGS,

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,648
HE STARTED ADAPTING
NATURE TO HIM.

6
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,717
THAT'S WHY MEN FLY
INTO HURRICANES,

7
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:20,320
THAT'S WHY THEY BUILD THEIR
HOMES ON EARTHQUAKE
FAULT LINES,

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,089
THAT'S WHY THEY TURN
RAIN FORESTS INTO MALLS.

9
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:25,024
THAT TAKES SOME
KIND OF AN EGO.

WE DON'T JUST STAND BACK

IMPROVE IT.

00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:52,711
OR YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU COULD DO

150
00:06:52,711 --> 00:06:54,179
IS TO STAPLE ALL
THE TILES ON FIRST

151
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:56,214
AND THEN PEEL
THE BACKING OFF.

152
00:06:56,214 --> 00:06:58,016
YEAH, YEAH.
THAT WOULD WORK.

153
00:06:58,016 --> 00:07:00,819
LEARN FROM MY MISTAKES,
SOMEBODY SHOULD.

154
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:02,688
ANOTHER TIP, YOU MIGHT
WANT TO LEAVE THE
STICKY STUFF

155
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,589
OFF OF THE BOTTOM
COUPLE FEET OF THE DOOR

156
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:07,025
IF YOU HAVE A DOG
OR A LITTLE KID
OR SOMETHING.

157
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:08,827
NOW THIS IS GOING
TO WORK GREAT AND
EVERYTHING

158
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:10,462
BUT IT'S A LITTLE
PASSIVE FOR MY TASTE.

159
00:07:10,462 --> 00:07:15,634
I LIKE SOMETHING THAT USES
POWER SO I'M THINKING
ELECTRIC BUG ZAPPER.

160
00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:17,436
AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO
NEED FOR THIS IS ONE OF
THESE OLD BEDS

161
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:19,538
'CAUSE YOU WANT THE
METAL SPRING OUT OF
THE BOTTOM

162
00:07:19,538 --> 00:07:23,809
AND YOU'RE GOING TO
NEED YOURSELF A ROLL
OF CHICKEN WIRE.

163
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:26,712
NOW, I'VE WRAPPED THE
CHICKEN WIRE ALL AROUND
THE OLD METAL BED SPRING

164
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,947
SO NONE OF THE BUGS
WILL BE ABLE TO SLIP
THROUGH THE CRACKS.

165
00:07:28,947 --> 00:07:30,816
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
IS HOOK THIS WHOLE RIG UP

166
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:33,518
TO THE BIGGEST POWER BOX
YOU GOT IN YOUR HOME.

167
00:07:33,518 --> 00:07:37,255
I'LL TELL YOU, THE NEIGHBOURS
WILL HAVE SOMETHING TO
TALK ABOUT HERE

168
00:07:37,255 --> 00:07:40,625
IF THEY CAN HEAR
THEMSELVES OVER THE
SOUND OF BUGS FRYING.

169
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,861
REMEMBER, IF WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

170
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:44,896
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

171
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:52,571
LET'S SEE IF WE GOT
ANY FLYING PESTS
AROUND HERE.

172
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:55,607
BOY, THAT WORKS GREAT.

173
00:07:55,607 --> 00:07:57,209
KIND OF AN
ODD SMELL THOUGH.

174
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:59,244
I COULD OPEN UP ONE OF
THEM CAJUN RESTAURANTS,

175
00:07:59,244 --> 00:08:01,546
MOSQUITO COOKING.

176
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:03,882
RED GREEN:
STAY TUNED, COMING UP

177
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:05,917
I'M GOING TO DO
SOMETHING TO BILL
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO,

178
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:07,486
AND HAROLD, LIKE
SO MANY TEENAGERS,

179
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:10,021
HAD A LITTLE SOMETHING
EXTRA IN HIS PANTS.

180
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:14,326
WELL THE GUYS HAVE
INSTALLED THE GLASS
ROOF IN BUSTER'S HOUSE

181
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:15,694
AND IT'S LOOKING
REAL GOOD.

182
00:08:15,694 --> 00:08:17,429
ONE GIANT SKYLIGHT.

183
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:19,264
FROM THE TOP OF
THE HILL LOOKING
DOWN IT LOOKS LIKE

184
00:08:19,264 --> 00:08:22,334
A GIANT SANDWICH
CONTAINER WITH A
SEE-THROUGH LID.

185
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:25,871
IT'S TIGHT, IT'S
DRY AND IT'S READY
FOR THE FIREFLIES.

186
00:08:25,871 --> 00:08:28,573
BUSTER FIGURES A COUPLE
HUNDRED THOUSAND WILL GIVE
HIM ENOUGH LIGHT AT NIGHT

187
00:08:28,573 --> 00:08:30,742
AND THEN PRIVACY
DURING THE DAYTIME.

188
00:08:30,742 --> 00:08:32,444
AND MRS. HADFIELD
IS A LOVELY WOMAN

189
00:08:32,444 --> 00:08:35,513
BUT YOU JUST DON'T WANT
TO SEE A LOT OF HER BEFORE
TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING.

190
00:08:35,513 --> 00:08:37,849
WHERE IS BUSTER GOING
TO GET ALL THESE
FIREFLIES FROM?

191
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:40,552
HE'S PAYING FOR
THEM HAROLD, A
PENNY A PIECE.

192
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:43,521
I FIGURE I'M GOING TO
MAKE A FEW BUCKS WITH
THIS JAR RIGHT HERE.

193
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:45,957
OH, OH, OH, OH,
OH, UNCLE RED,

194
00:08:45,957 --> 00:08:49,361
WHEN IT COMES
TO CATCHING BUGS,
I AM THE CHAMP.

195
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:51,529
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

196
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:55,300
THEY'RE DRAWN TO
YOU LIKE FLIES TO
SOMETHING OR OTHER.

197
00:08:56,835 --> 00:09:01,072
MAYBE WHEN THE BUGS SEE
YOU THEY THINK IT'S A
FAMILY REUNION, HAROLD.

198
00:09:01,072 --> 00:09:06,611
OR MAYBE BECAUSE IT'S
I'M AN ICKTHEOLOGIST.

199
00:09:06,611 --> 00:09:08,747
BOY, THERE'S A FANCY
WORD FOR DOOFUS.

200
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:13,385
PORTIONS OF THIS SHOW
WOULD HAVEBEEN BROUGHT TO
YOU BY BRACKSTON'S MARINA,

201
00:09:13,385 --> 00:09:15,987
BUT WE'RE
HAVING AN OFF YEAR.

202
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:21,893
LOST, A LARGE
EUROPEAN LYCOSA TARANTULA.

203
00:09:21,893 --> 00:09:23,628
THAT SOUNDS
INTERESTING.

204
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:25,997
ALSO OWN AS THE
TARANTULA SPIDER.

205
00:09:25,997 --> 00:09:30,335
OKAY, IT ESCAPED FROM A CAGE.
LIKES DARK WARM PLACES.

206
00:09:30,335 --> 00:09:32,737
CONTACT STINKY
IF YOU SEE HIM

207
00:09:32,737 --> 00:09:35,440
OR IF YOU SUDDENLY FEEL
A PAINFUL, SHARP BITE.

208
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,276
IT GROSSED ME OUT.

209
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,147
WHAT'S THAT?

210
00:09:42,147 --> 00:09:47,552
OH, OH, OH.

00:09:47,552 --> 00:09:48,620

00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,989
OH I'M YOUNG,

213
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:56,561
OH.
UNCLE RED, HELP!

214
00:09:56,561 --> 00:10:00,932
[ BITING SOUND ]

220
00:10:09,874 --> 00:10:11,276
WHAT'S GOING
ON HERE, GORD?

221
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:14,979
WELL, MY CORRESPONDENCE
SCHOOL IS HAVING
A REUNION TODAY.

222
00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:17,315
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

223
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:18,850
WELL, IT'S A
CORRESPONDENCE
SCHOOL, RED,

224
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,019
EVERYBODY IS WHERE
THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN,
AT HOME.

225
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:23,688
THAT'S WHERE WE
WENT TO SCHOOL, SEE.

226
00:10:23,688 --> 00:10:25,657
AND I MIGHT
SAY I THINK I'VE
HELD UP PRETTY WELL.

227
00:10:25,657 --> 00:10:27,659
I STILL HAVE
ALL MY OWN HAIR.

228
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:29,294
SEE THAT?
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.

229
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:32,397
MY GOOD SPORTS
JACKET STILL
FITS ME.

230
00:10:32,397 --> 00:10:35,333
OH, THERE'S MY OLD
PEN AND PENCIL SET.

231
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,901
THAT BRINGS BACK
SOME MEMORIES.

232
00:10:36,901 --> 00:10:39,103
OH, FOR GOSH SAKE.

233
00:10:39,103 --> 00:10:42,006
YOU KNOW, IF I WAS
AT A REAL SCHOOL
WITH REAL PEOPLE,

234
00:10:42,006 --> 00:10:43,641
I BET THEY'D TEASE
THE HECK OUT OF ME

235
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:45,677
ON HOW I NEVER LET
ANYBODY BORROW THESE.

236
00:10:45,677 --> 00:10:47,145
YEAH.
OH, YEAH, FOR SURE.

237
00:10:47,145 --> 00:10:48,746
GORD BEFORE WE GET
TOO FAR INTO THIS,

238
00:10:48,746 --> 00:10:51,749
WHAT CAN YOU TELL
ME ABOUT CATCHING
FIREFLIES?

239
00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:53,184
NOT TOO MUCH, RED.
OH.

240
00:10:53,184 --> 00:10:55,853
BUT I KNOW
SOMEBODY WHO DOES.

241
00:10:55,853 --> 00:10:58,022
WAIT.

GORD, GORD, YOU

250
00:11:13,037 --> 00:11:15,106
NO, NO.
BUT IN MY MIND.

251
00:11:15,106 --> 00:11:19,077
IN MY MIND I
IMAGINED THAT
HE WAS.

252
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:21,079
THERE IS JOANNA
ARMSTRONG.

253

THEN YOU GOT

280
00:12:37,355 --> 00:12:43,127
NOW YOU'RE PUTTING KILLER
SPIDERS IN YOUR PANTS.

DO YOU WANT TO SEE IT?

294
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:18,729
SHOULD I JUST TAKE
IT OUTSIDE AND
DISPOSE OF IT?

295
00:13:18,729 --> 00:13:21,599
ALL RIGHT, BUT

NO, NO, WE'RE EVEN.

297
00:13:29,306 --> 00:13:31,475
WELL, IT'S TIME
FOR ADVENTURES
WITH BILL.

298
00:13:31,475 --> 00:13:33,811
AND WHAT DO YOU GOT
FOR US TODAY BILL?

299
00:13:33,811 --> 00:13:36,046
I DON'T WEAR HATS.
NOT THAT KIND OF HAT.

300
00:13:36,046 --> 00:13:38,949
OH, IT'S A BEE KEEP,
A BEE KEEP.

301
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:40,217
OH BOY, I DON'T KNOW.

302
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:41,919
YOU'RE GOING
TO BE A BEEKEEPER, BILL?

303
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,053
I DON'T KNOW.

304
00:13:43,053 --> 00:13:44,855
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN KIND
OF LEERY ABOUT BEES.

305
00:13:44,855 --> 00:13:46,357
OH MY GOSH, LOOK
AT THAT HIVE.

306
00:13:46,357 --> 00:13:47,558
OH BOY.
OH BOY.

307
00:13:47,558 --> 00:13:49,226
STAY BACK.
STAY BACK.
STAY BACK.

308
00:13:49,226 --> 00:13:51,795
I'M NOT ALLERGIC OR
ANYTHING BUT I DON'T
WANT -- OH MAN.

309
00:13:51,795 --> 00:13:53,697
NOW APPARENTLY THEY
DON'T GO FAR
FROM THE HIVE

310
00:13:53,697 --> 00:13:55,733
SO YOU'RE REALLY NOT
IN AS MUCH DANGER AS YOU,

311
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:57,501
YOU KNOW -- STRAIGHT
ON THE END OF THE.

312
00:13:57,501 --> 00:14:00,037
BILL YOU HUNG --
BILL YOU HUNG YOUR STUFF

313
00:14:00,037 --> 00:14:02,239
RIGHT ON THE END
OF THE BRANCH,

314
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,607
THE SAME HIVE.

315
00:14:03,607 --> 00:14:05,042
WELL, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

316
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:06,710
I WOULDN'T SHAKE THAT.

317
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,913
I TAKE IT -- I'D BE REAL
CAREFUL OF THAT BILL.

318
00:14:08,913 --> 00:14:13,183
NOW, APPARENTLY
THESE BEE --
BILL, OH, OH...

319
00:14:13,183 --> 00:14:16,220
APPARENTLY THESE
OUTFITS ARE MADE OF
SOME KIND OF MATERIAL

320
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,788
THAT THE BEE STINGER
WON'T GO --

321
00:14:17,788 --> 00:14:19,590
I'M PUTTING
THE HAT ON.

322
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,392
YEAH, I DON'T --
BILL DON'T PULL.
BILL DON'T.

323
00:14:21,392 --> 00:14:22,760
BILL.
BILL.
BILL.

324
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,428
NO, I WOULDN'T
PULL TOO HARD.

325
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:27,498
OH. DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT THAT
ANYMORE.

326
00:14:27,498 --> 00:14:29,566
NOW I FEEL LIKE I'M A
KINDERGARTEN TEACHER

327
00:14:29,566 --> 00:14:32,002
TRYING TO HELP
HIM GET HIS LITTLE
COVERALLS ON THERE.

328
00:14:32,002 --> 00:14:33,470
WHAT WAS THAT?
WHAT WAS THAT?

329
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,972
I THINK SOMETHING
WENT BY THERE, BILL.

330
00:14:34,972 --> 00:14:36,240
DID YOU HEAR
SOMETHING GO BY?

331
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,808
NO?
OH WELL.

332
00:14:37,808 --> 00:14:38,842
I GUESS WE'RE OKAY.

333
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:40,277
NOW HE'S GOING
TO COLLECT THE HONEY.

334
00:14:40,277 --> 00:14:42,179
APPARENTLY IF YOU STICK
A KNIFE IN THE BOTTOM
OF THE HIVE,

335
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:43,781
THE HONEY WILL JUST
DRIP OUT OF THERE

336
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:46,316
JUST LIKE JIMMY ROGERS
WAS SINGING A SONG
ABOUT IT.

337
00:14:46,316 --> 00:14:48,585
SO THAT'S MY
JOB I GUESS.

338
00:14:48,585 --> 00:14:50,654
LIKE HECK IT IS.
I'M GOING ANYWHERE NEAR IT.

339
00:14:50,654 --> 00:14:52,489
WHERE'S THE HIVE?

340
00:14:52,489 --> 00:14:53,691
WHERE DID IT GO?

341
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:55,125
WHERE DID THE HIVE GO?

342
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,495
WAIT A MINUTE,
I HOPE THAT'S A HIVE.

343
00:14:58,495 --> 00:15:00,964
I GOT A KNIFE HERE
SO JUST STAND
STILL BILL.

344
00:15:00,964 --> 00:15:03,600
THIS WILL BE PERFECTLY
SAFE, I THINK.

345
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,404
I'M PRETTY SURE.
OR MAYBE NOT.

346
00:15:07,404 --> 00:15:08,939
WOW.
WOW.

347
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:10,674
LOOK AT THAT.

348
00:15:10,674 --> 00:15:12,609
LOOKS LIKE ONE
OF THOSE TAP DANCERS,

349
00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:14,745
YOU KNOW, THOSE
SINGING, DANCING GUYS?

350
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:16,513
MAYBE HE SHOULD BE
IN ONE OF THOSE
BEE MOVIES.

351
00:15:16,513 --> 00:15:18,749
RED GREEN:
COMING UP HAROLD IS
GOING TO USE HIS FACE

352
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:20,851
TO PROVE THAT BUGS
WILL EAT EVERYTHING

353
00:15:20,851 --> 00:15:24,788
AND OUR HOME RENO EXPERT
MIKE IS GOING TO DO
SOME WIRING FOR US.

354
00:15:29,193 --> 00:15:30,994
IF A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE
IS A DANGEROUS THING,

355
00:15:30,994 --> 00:15:34,865
POSSUM LODGE HAS GOT TO
BE THE MOST DANGEROUS
PLACE ON EARTH.

356
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:36,200
I DON'T REMEMBER
CATCHING FIREFLIES

357
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,001
EVER BEING
LIFE-THREATENING.

358
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:40,504
I COULD BE FLIRTING
WITH MALARIA.

359
00:15:40,504 --> 00:15:42,072
WELL, IF IT WORKS
LIKE YOUR OTHER
FLIRTING

360
00:15:42,072 --> 00:15:45,309
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

361
00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:48,712
SO HOW MANY FIREFLIES
HAVE YOU CAUGHT SO FAR?

362
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:51,048
ROUGHLY, NONE.

363
00:15:51,048 --> 00:15:53,784
HAH, HAH, HAH,
GOOD, WE'RE TIED.

364
00:15:53,784 --> 00:15:57,888
WELL, I STOPPED TRYING
HAROLD UNTIL BUSTER
GETS THE FIRE PUT OUT.

365
00:15:57,888 --> 00:15:59,289
HE HAD A FIRE?

366
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:00,958
YEAH, SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THE ANGLE OF THE SUN

367
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,259
HITTING THE PITCH
OF THE ROOF

368
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:03,493
AND THEN WHEN THEY
PUT THE GLASS IN,

369
00:16:03,493 --> 00:16:04,995
THEY KIND OF CRIMPED
'ER SO SHE'S A BIT BENT

370
00:16:04,995 --> 00:16:08,098
AND IT MADE LIKE A LASER
BEAM INTO HIS HOUSE.

371
00:16:08,098 --> 00:16:09,866
THAT'S COOL.
YEAH.

372
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:11,501
THAT'S LIKE
WHEN YOU TAKE A
MAGNIFYING GLASS

373
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:12,669
AND YOU HOLD IT
JUST SO, YOU KNOW,

374
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:16,573
SO YOU CAN BURN THE
LEGS OFF ANTS.

375
00:16:16,573 --> 00:16:19,676
WELL, THIS ACTUALLY BURNED
THE LEGS OFF OF BUSTER'S
DINING ROOM SUITE.

376
00:16:19,676 --> 00:16:22,279
AND THEN AS THE DAY
WENT BY WITH THE
SUN MOVING,

377
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:25,315
THAT BEAM SCORCHED
A STRAIGHT LINE
ACROSS THE RUG,

378
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:29,186
CUT THE COUCH IN HALF,
BISSECTED THE COFFEE TABLE,

379
00:16:29,186 --> 00:16:30,387
MELTED THE FRIDGE

380
00:16:30,387 --> 00:16:33,190
AND COOKED THE KISSING
GOURAMIS IN HIS AQUARIUM.

381
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,525
WOW.
WHAT'S HE GOING TO DO NOW?

382
00:16:35,525 --> 00:16:38,161
A RAIN DANCE
I WOULD THINK.

383
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,532
YOU KNOW WHAT THE
HARDEST PART OF
THIS JOB IS?

384
00:16:42,532 --> 00:16:45,535
LEAP YEARS, MAN.

385
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,605
THIS WEEK IN OUR DREAM
HOME RENOVATION SEGMENT,

386
00:16:48,605 --> 00:16:51,141
WE'RE GOING TO DO
SOME WORK ON THE
LODGE ITSELF.

387
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:53,610
BECAUSE YOU KNOW
THAT OLD SAYING,
CHARITY BEGINS AT HOME.

388
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,812
OF COURSE,
NOT MY HOME.

389
00:16:55,812 --> 00:16:58,448
YOU KNOW TO ME THE
MARK OF A TRULY
WONDERFUL HOUSE

390
00:16:58,448 --> 00:17:00,784
IS THE NUMBER
OF ELECTRICAL
OUTLETS IT HAS.

391
00:17:00,784 --> 00:17:03,253
YOU CAN'T HAVE
ENOUGH OF THOSE
BABIES.

392
00:17:03,253 --> 00:17:05,589
SO I'VE ASKED MIKE,
HERE TO PUT ANOTHER
ELECTRICAL OUTLET

393
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:08,125
UP INTO MY BEDROOM
RIGHT ABOVE US HERE.

394
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,193
PLEASE WELCOME
OUR CONTRACTOR, MIKE.

395
00:17:10,193 --> 00:17:16,867
[ APPLAUSE ]

396
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:19,069
HI, MR. GREEN.

397
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:22,172
WELL, HERE IT IS, A PLUG
TO YOUR BEDROOM JUST
LIKE YOU ASKED FOR.

398
00:17:22,172 --> 00:17:26,343
MIKE, IT LOOKS
LIKE YOU TOOK A
WIRE FROM THE BASEMENT,

399
00:17:26,343 --> 00:17:27,577
COME UP THROUGH
THE FLOOR

400
00:17:27,577 --> 00:17:29,980
AND WENT STRAIGHT UP
THROUGH THE CEILING THERE.

401
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,448
YEAH, AND I
TELL YOU WHAT.
YEAH.

402
00:17:31,448 --> 00:17:33,083
IF YOU GOT A PLUG
IN THE MIDDLE OF
YOUR ROOM.

403
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:36,386
YOU CAN PLUG INTO
ANYTHING YOU WANT IN
THE WHOLE WIDE ROOM.

404
00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:38,255
IT'S CONVENIENT.
YEAH.

405
00:17:38,255 --> 00:17:40,390
SEE I'M APPLYING
MYSELF, MR. GREEN.
YEAH.

406
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,460
JUST LIKE YOU AND THE
PRISON CHAPLAIN
TOLD ME TO.

407
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,961
WELL, NO, NO,
THAT'S GOOD.

408
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:47,864
I JUST, YOU KNOW,
I JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS CABLE

409
00:17:47,864 --> 00:17:50,867
HANGING RIGHT THROUGH
THE CENTRE OF THE
LIVING ROOM HERE.

410
00:17:50,867 --> 00:17:55,305
WELL, NOBODY
WILL NOTICE.

411
00:17:55,305 --> 00:17:57,908
NO, I THINK THEY
MIGHT, MIKE,
YOU KNOW.

412
00:17:57,908 --> 00:18:01,077
IT KIND OF CATCHES
YOUR EYE THERE.

413
00:18:01,077 --> 00:18:02,846
I KNEW IT WOULDN'T WORK.
I MEAN, I'M USELESS.

414
00:18:02,846 --> 00:18:05,382
I'M JUST A
PIECE OF GARBAGE.
I'M JUST USELESS.

415
00:18:05,382 --> 00:18:07,350
NOW, MIKE, DON'T
GET DOWN ON YOURSELF.

416
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:10,320
YOU TRIED SOMETHING,
IT JUST DIDN'T FLY,
THAT'S ALL.

417
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,088
HEY, I GOT A
GREAT IDEA.

418
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:14,190
WE BUILD A WALL,
COVER UP THE WIRE,

419
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,692
RIGHT, RIGHT DOWN
THE MIDDLE HERE, RIGHT?

420
00:18:15,692 --> 00:18:18,194
YOU SEPARATE YOUR
LIVING ROOM INTO
TWO ROOMS.

421
00:18:18,194 --> 00:18:20,263
YOU GOT TWO
LIVING ROOMS, RIGHT?

422
00:18:20,263 --> 00:18:22,799
WELL, TWO HALF
LIVING ROOMS.

423
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,234
OKAY.
OKAY.

424
00:18:24,234 --> 00:18:26,903
THEN YOU BUILD A WALL
JUST UP TO HERE,
LIKE A HALF WALL.

425
00:18:26,903 --> 00:18:29,406
LIKE IF YOU WANT
TO TALK YOU CAN SAY
HELLO HOW ARE YOU.

426
00:18:29,406 --> 00:18:30,674
OH, YEAH.
YEAH.

427
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:32,242
I LIKE IT.
I LIKE IT.

428
00:18:32,242 --> 00:18:34,778
LIKE A DUTCH...
A DUTCH WALL.
A DUTCH WALL, YEAH.

429
00:18:34,778 --> 00:18:36,513
ALL RIGHT.
AND THEN WHAT WOULD
YOU DO WITH THE CABLE

430
00:18:36,513 --> 00:18:38,915
THAT GOES FROM
THERE ON UP?

431
00:18:38,915 --> 00:18:45,288
OH GEEZ.
I'M A PIECE--
OF HUMAN FARM MANURE.

432
00:18:45,288 --> 00:18:46,990
THAT'S WHAT I AM.
JUST SEND ME BACK.

433
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,559
LOCK ME UP.
TAKE ME AWAY.

434
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:52,228
I'M A PIECE
OF USELESSNESS,
THAT'S WHAT I AM.

435
00:18:52,228 --> 00:18:54,097
GOT A THOUGHT.
GOT A THOUGHT.
WHAT?

436
00:18:54,097 --> 00:18:55,932
YOU SEE THAT
VERTICAL BEAM
THERE?

437
00:18:55,932 --> 00:18:57,500
WHY DON'T WE BRING
THAT OVER HERE,

438
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,102
PUT THE WIRE
UP INSIDE IT.

439
00:18:59,102 --> 00:19:02,172
NOBODY IS GOING TO SEE
AND NOBODY IS GOING
TO BE ANY THE WISER.

440
00:19:02,172 --> 00:19:04,441
THAT'S A SUPPORTING
BEAM, ISN'T IT?

441
00:19:04,441 --> 00:19:07,277
YEAH, BUT WE'LL
MOVE IT REALLY FAST.

442
00:19:07,277 --> 00:19:10,914
HUH?
HUH?

443
00:19:10,914 --> 00:19:12,949
HUH?
MR. GREEN.

444
00:19:12,949 --> 00:19:16,653

OH, NOT BAD RED.

449

LAST YEAR
WE LOST $50,000.
YEAH.

450

THROUGH THE SEASON, WE'RE
ONLY DOWN 12,000,

SUCCESS STORY RIGHT

EXACTLY, WHICH BRINGS
US TO TODAY'S
BOATING TIP,

464
00:19:55,158 --> 00:19:57,794
IS HOW TO MAKE YOUR
BOAT LOOK BETTER.

NOW, IF IT
DOESN'T RUN GOOD,

466
00:19:58,995 --> 00:20:00,597
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
IT CAN'T LOOK GOOD.

NO, I GUESS WITH
A BOAT LIKE THIS,

00:20:01,898 --> 00:20:04,067
WE GO SEE EDGAR, GET SOME
DYNAMITE AND BLOW THIS --

WON'T BUY THAT TWICE.

470
00:20:10,406 --> 00:20:13,209
SO ANYWAY,
RED, PINSTRIPING.
THAT'S THE KEY.

471
00:20:13,209 --> 00:20:15,044
OH GOSH.
I CAN'T DO IT.

472
00:20:15,044 --> 00:20:16,479

WHEN I BEND OVER.

TAPE IS THIS, GLEN?

ME THEY USED IT ON THE
HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE.

FIRE PROOF, NON-FADING
AND METEOR RESISTANT.

SHOULD RUN A STRIP
OF THIS

00:20:30,293 --> 00:20:32,695
RIGHT ACROSS HIS LIVING
ROOM FLOOR TO BLOCK THAT
SUNBEAM THING.

481
00:20:32,695 --> 00:20:34,263
OH, SURE HE COULD
DO THAT, YEAH.

482
00:20:34,263 --> 00:20:36,165
YOU KNOW HE COULD
PUT IT RIGHT ACROSS
THE HARDWOOD FLOOR

483
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:39,702
BECAUSE IT'S MADE
FOR WOOD BOATS.

I CAN CATCH MY LIMIT.

ANYMORE TAPE THERE?

FOR THE NAME?

LONG AS THE BOAT
IS CALLED HYPHEN.

GOING TO MATTER, RED.

GREAT LAST NIGHT.

ALL THOSE FIREFLIES
ALL OVER THE PLACE
IN THE CEILING.

499
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:30,519

00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:32,922
YEAH, HE HAD HIS
OWN PLANETARIUM
FOR A WHILE, THERE.

501
00:21:32,922 --> 00:21:35,057
BUT BUSTER DIDN'T
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT
THE BATS.

502
00:21:35,057 --> 00:21:36,692
I MEAN, THE BATS
SAW ALL THEM
FIREFLIES,

LOOKED TO THEM LIKE
