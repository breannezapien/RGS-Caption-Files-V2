[glass shattering]

5
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,244
>> OKAY.

6
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:44,911
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS IT.

7
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:45,945
WE'RE STARTING NOW.

8
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:46,913
THEY LAUGHED WHEN WE SAT DOWN

9
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,648
TO PLAY, BUT WE MADE COMEDY,

10
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:49,449
AND, BOY,

11
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:50,717
THEY'RE NOT LAUGHIN' NOW.

12
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,018
AND HERE'S THE MAIN REASON FOR

13
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:53,753
THAT, THE STAR OF OUR SHOW

14
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:54,854
AND THE BEST UNCLE

15
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:55,922
A PERSON EVER HAD; I DON'T

16
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:56,689
EVEN CARE WHO THEY ARE.

17
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:57,690
HE'S THE BEST.

18
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,892
THE STAR OF THE RED GREEN SHOW,

19
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:03,162
MR. RED GREEN.

20
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:05,331
OKAY.

21
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:06,065
IT'S OKAY, UNCLE RED.

22
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:07,800
COME ON IN.

23
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,037
[applause]

24
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:12,472
>> THANK YOU, HAROLD.

25
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:14,040
ESPECIALLY THANK YOU TO ALL THE

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,642
VIEWERS FOR TUNING US IN WHEN

27
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,644
THERE--THERE'S SO MUCH MINDLESS

28
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:19,045
CRAP ON TELEVISION.

29
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,580
SPEAKING OF MINDLESS CRAP, COME

30
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,282
ON OVER HERE A MINUTE, HAROLD.

31
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,384
HAROLD IS NOT JUST THE ANNOUNCER

32
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:25,218
ON THE SHOW.

33
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,352
HE'S ALSO OUR PRODUCER AND

34
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:27,754
DIRECTOR, AND HE WENT TO SCHOOL

35
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,554
FOR THAT.

36
00:01:28,554 --> 00:01:29,522
WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THAT

37
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:30,590
COLLEGE OF YOU WENT TO, HAROLD?

38
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,457
>> I DON'T KNOW.

39
00:01:31,457 --> 00:01:32,458
IT JUST CAME--SORT OF CAME

40
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:33,126
IN THE MAIL.

41
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,528
WAS IT EVER EXCELLENT.

42
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:36,329
>> I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

43
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:37,597
THE SHOW IS IN REAL GOOD HANDS

44
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,364
HERE.

45
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:39,332
AND, WELL, HAROLD, MAYBE YOU

46
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:40,299
SHOULD EXPLAIN TO THE VIEWERS

47
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:41,901
ABOUT THIS LITTLE GIZMO HERE.

48
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:42,935
THEY MIGHT THINK IT'S SOMETHING

49
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:44,037
MEDICAL, YOU KNOW.

50
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,071
>> [laughs] NO.

51
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:46,339
NO, THIS IS A VIDEO EFFECTS

52
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:47,106
MACHINE.

53
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:48,007
IT'S LIKE THE EDGAR WINTER

54
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:48,841
MODEL.

55
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:50,176
[laughs]

56
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,445
IT CREATES VISUAL EFFECTS.

57
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,149
>> WELL, HAROLD TELLS ME THAT'S

58
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,150
THE KIND OF THING THAT THE

59
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,218
MODERN VIEWER GOES FOR, AND

60
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:01,721
HAROLD HERE KNOWS TELEVISION,

61
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:02,989
DON'T YOU, HAROLD?

62
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,357
>> YEAH, OKAY.

63
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:05,258
>> HOW WOULD YOU SAY THE SHOW'S

64
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,225
GOING SO FAR?

65
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:07,026
>> DRAGGIN' A BIT,

66
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:08,494
IN MY OPINION.

67
00:02:08,494 --> 00:02:10,596
>> AH, THESE YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY.

68
00:02:10,596 --> 00:02:11,531
THEY'RE NOT AFRAID TO SPEAK

69
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:12,265
THEIR MINDS.

70
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,533
I LIKE THAT.

71
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,101
NOT ALL THE TIME, MIND YOU.

72
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,402
LIKE, NOT NOW.

73
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:17,637
YOU KNOW, I WAS GONNA TELL YOU

74
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,439
THAT LAST NIGHT UP AT THE LODGE,

75
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,673
WE WERE MAKING CHILI, AND WE

76
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:22,108
FOUND A RUNNING SHOE

77
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:23,209
RIGHT IN THE CHILI,

78
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,210
WHICH ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE

79
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,278
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

80
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,345
WE FIGURED IT WAS PROBABLY

81
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:27,880
STINKY PETERSON'S SHOE,

82
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,215
BECAUSE HE LIKES TO GET

83
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:30,283
INTO THE CHILI POT

84
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:32,051
AND STOMP ON THE KIDNEY BEANS.

85
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,152
OTHERWISE, THEY GIVE HIM GAS,

86
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:35,054
SO WE DON'T SAY NO.

87
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:36,455
BUT IT WASN'T STINKY'S, SO--

88
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:37,256
>> UNCLE RED, I'M SORRY.

89
00:02:37,256 --> 00:02:38,157
WE DON'T HAVE TIME

90
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:38,958
FOR YOUR STORY.

91
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:39,926
YEAH, SORRY.

92
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:40,893
JUST GO TO THE NEXT CLIP.

93
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:41,894
JUST, YOU KNOW, GO.

94
00:02:41,894 --> 00:02:43,029
NEXT CLIP.

95
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,096
>> WELL, I THINK THE PEOPLE WANT

96
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,931
TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED

97
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:45,765
TO THE RUNNING SHOE.

98
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:46,699
>> YEAH, WE'LL TELL 'EM LATER,

99
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,301
'CAUSE RIGHT NOW, IT'S BORING.

100
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,235
I CAN HEAR PEOPLE

101
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:50,836
CHANGING THEIR TV CHANNELS.

102
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:51,771
CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK.

103
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:52,538
CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK.

104
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:53,506
YOU BETTER GO TO THE NEXT

105
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,440
SEGMENT.

106
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,541
CLICK, CLICK, CLICK.

107
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,376
>> AH, WELL, I GUESS WE'LL GET

108
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:58,544
BACK TO THE STORY LATER AND

109
00:02:58,544 --> 00:03:00,513
RIGHT NOW GO TO A FILM CLIP OF

110
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,915
SOME KIND.

111
00:03:05,484 --> 00:03:07,386
WHAT IN THE SAM HILL IS THAT?

112
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:08,521
>> SPECIAL EFFECTS.

113
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,690
NEAT, EH?

114
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,961
>> THERE ONCE WAS A FELLA

115
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,662
THAT LIVED AROUND HERE

116
00:03:16,662 --> 00:03:18,331
HE MADE HIS OWN CLOTHES

117
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:19,732
AND BREWED HIS OWN BEER

118
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:21,434
BUT THE ONE THING ABOUT HIM

119
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:22,802
THAT FILLED US WITH DREAD

120
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,837
WAS THE NUMBER OF CHEMICALS

121
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,739
HE KEPT IN HIS SHED

122
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,374
PESTICIDE BOB

123
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,775
PESTICIDE BOB

124
00:03:29,775 --> 00:03:31,744
HE USED WHATEVER WAS RIGHT

125
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:33,045
FOR THE JOB

126
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:34,647
WEED KILLER, RAT KILLER

127
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,415
ROSE DUST, AND MACE

128
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:37,616
HE NEVER WORE GLOVES

129
00:03:37,616 --> 00:03:39,819
OR A MASK ON HIS FACE

130
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,721
HIS MANNER WAS DISTANT

131
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,122
HIS OUTLOOK WAS DRAB

132
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:44,724
WHEN HE DIED, HE SMELLED

133
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,525
LIKE A CHEMISTRY LAB

134
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:48,160
WE BURIED HIM DEEP

135
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,895
AND MADE SURE THEY PAID US

136
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:50,963
'CAUSE HIS CORPSE KILLED

137
00:03:50,963 --> 00:03:52,164
ALL VEGETATION

138
00:03:52,164 --> 00:03:54,667
WITHIN A 30-MILE RADIUS

139
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,603
PESTICIDE BOB

140
00:03:57,603 --> 00:03:59,271
THIS WEEK ON HANDYMAN CORNER,

141
00:03:59,271 --> 00:04:00,306
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU OUTSIDE

142
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,674
AND SHOW YOU HOW TO UPGRADE

143
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:02,842
YOUR VEHICLE.

144
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,376
YOU KNOW, THEY--THEY JUST DON'T

145
00:04:04,376 --> 00:04:05,878
MAKE VANS LIKE THIS ANYMORE.

146
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:06,746
AND IF ANY OF YOU VIEWERS

147
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,614
HAVE ONE, WELL, YOU KNOW WHY.

148
00:04:08,614 --> 00:04:10,149
NOW, I KNOW IN THE DAY,

149
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,050
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD FIX HER UP

150
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,551
BY DOING SOME BODY WORK OR MAYBE

151
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:13,586
FINALLY GETTIN' AROUND TO DOIN'

152
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,553
THAT RING AND VALVE JOB OR

153
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:15,354
ANYTHING, BUT I THINK

154
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:16,288
IT'S A LOT MORE FUN

155
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:17,056
AND SOMETHING YOU CAN TALK ABOUT

156
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:18,457
AT PARTIES TO INSTALL YOUR OWN

157
00:04:18,457 --> 00:04:21,260
AIR CONDITIONER.

158
00:04:23,562 --> 00:04:28,434
NOW, I GOT THE IDEA TO--

159
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,368
I GOT THE IDEA TO PUT IN

160
00:04:29,368 --> 00:04:30,669
AIR CONDITIONING WHEN I--WHEN

161
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:32,671
I FOUND THIS AIR CONDITIONER.

162
00:04:32,671 --> 00:04:33,372
IT WAS JUST SITTING

163
00:04:33,372 --> 00:04:34,139
ON THE SIDEWALK

164
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:35,608
IN FRONT OF A HOUSE.

165
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,976
AND WHETHER IT WAS OUT THERE TO

166
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,077
GO IN THE GARBAGE, OR MAYBE THE

167
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,545
PEOPLE WERE MOVING AND JUST

168
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:40,346
HADN'T PUT IT IN THE TRUCK YET.

169
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,947
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

170
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:44,884
BUT--OH!

171
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,485
THE DEAL IS THERE THAT

172
00:04:46,485 --> 00:04:47,887
WITH AN AIR CONDITIONER NOW,

173
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,421
SHE RUNS 120 VOLTS.

174
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:51,590
AND THE VAN RUNS 12 VOLTS, SO

175
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,958
WHAT YOU NEED IS A STEP-UP

176
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,660
TRANSFORMER, WHICH ANY IDIOT

177
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,829
CAN MAKE, AND I'LL PROVE IT.

178
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,698
TO MAKE--TO MAKE THE

179
00:04:59,698 --> 00:05:01,433
TRANSFORMER, YOU NEED ONE OF

180
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:02,568
THESE WHEEL RIMS.

181
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:03,836
WE HAVE A LOT OF THESE UP AT THE

182
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,971
LODGE, 'CAUSE THE MICE JUST EAT

183
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:07,773
THE RUBBER RIGHT OFF THE TIRES.

184
00:05:07,773 --> 00:05:09,308
AND, YOU KNOW, THE--

185
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:10,542
THE DROPPINGS, THEY'LL BOUNCE

186
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:11,443
FROM HERE TO HOLLYWOOD,

187
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:12,311
YOU KNOW.

188
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:14,513
SO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS, YOU

189
00:05:14,513 --> 00:05:16,015
GOTTA GO 12 VOLTS, 120 VOLTS.

190
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:17,883
SO THAT'S THE--THAT'S THE RATIO

191
00:05:17,883 --> 00:05:18,917
ON THE TRANSFORMER.

192
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:21,587
SO YOU DIVIDE 12 BY 20, AND

193
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,789
THAT'S, UH...

194
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:26,291
120 DIVIDED BY 12.

195
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:29,395
UH, CARRY THE 4 IS...

196
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,897
[sniffs] 10.

197
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:33,332
10, OKAY.

198
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:36,468
SO NOW YOU--YOU GOTTA WRAP YOUR

199
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:38,637
WIRE AROUND ON THAT RATIO OF 10.

200
00:05:38,637 --> 00:05:41,473
SO YOU'D PUT 30--SAY 30 COILS ON

201
00:05:41,473 --> 00:05:44,176
ONE SIDE, AND THEN 10 TIMES--

202
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:46,478
30 TIME--UH...

203
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:52,017
[whispering]

204
00:05:52,017 --> 00:05:54,753
418.

205
00:05:57,489 --> 00:06:00,325
ALL RIGHT, THAT ONLY TOOK A FEW

206
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:02,961
HOURS, AND NOW WE--NOW WE CAN

207
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:04,630
HOOK HER UP TO OUR POWER SUPPLY.

208
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,931
WE GOT THE TRANSFORMER.

209
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:06,932
LET ME JUST GO AROUND

210
00:06:06,932 --> 00:06:07,866
ON THE GROUND IN FRONT HERE

211
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:11,136
AND JUST HOIST THIS UP AND--

212
00:06:11,136 --> 00:06:14,173
OH, HERE WE ARE.

213
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:17,442
RUN THESE BATTERY CABLES,

214
00:06:17,442 --> 00:06:19,978
HOOK THEM ONTO THE BATTERY.

215
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,048
NOW JUST RUN THE CABLES--

216
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:24,550
AND WE'LL KEEP THEM APART

217
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,786
AND RUN THE CABLES AROUND HERE.

218
00:06:27,786 --> 00:06:29,288
YOU KNOW, WE'RE JUST--THIS IS

219
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:31,156
JUST TEMPORARY UNLESS IT WORKS.

220
00:06:31,156 --> 00:06:32,457
AND IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE

221
00:06:32,457 --> 00:06:33,859
A REAL FANCY INSTALLATION,

222
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:34,793
I SUPPOSE YOU COULD, YOU KNOW,

223
00:06:34,793 --> 00:06:35,827
GO IN THROUGH THE WINDOWS

224
00:06:35,827 --> 00:06:37,129
AND THROUGH THE WALLS

225
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:38,363
AND SO ON, BUT THAT WOULD

226
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:40,365
INVOLVE A LOT OF HAMMERING.

227
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:42,568
OKAY, SO NOW WHAT WE DO IS,

228
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,936
WE HOOK HER UP

229
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,571
TO THE TRANSFORMER.

230
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,572
AND THIS IS GOING

231
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,441
ON THE SMALL SIDE HERE.

232
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:51,476
OH, FOR GOSH SAKE.

233
00:06:51,476 --> 00:06:52,444
[laughs]

234
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:54,179
OKAY, WE'LL HOOK THAT UP THERE.

235
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:56,081
AND WE'LL--

236
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:58,116
OH, PERFECT, PERFECT.

237
00:06:58,116 --> 00:06:59,318
OKAY.

238
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,552
NOW WE NEED TO HOOK THE OTHER

239
00:07:00,552 --> 00:07:03,221
SIDE UP TO THE AIR CONDITIONER.

240
00:07:03,221 --> 00:07:05,123
WHERE'S THE OTHER WIRE HERE NOW?

241
00:07:05,123 --> 00:07:06,625
HERE WE GO.

242
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:07,926
YEAH, AND THIS IS A--THIS IS

243
00:07:07,926 --> 00:07:10,028
THE STEP-UP TRANSFORMER

244
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:11,563
ASPECT OF IT.

245
00:07:11,563 --> 00:07:14,299
NOW, A LOT OF YOU SAFETY NUTS

246
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:15,033
WOULD PROBABLY WANT

247
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:18,570
TO TAPE THESE.

248
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,571
THERE WE GO.

249
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:20,872
OKAY.

250
00:07:20,872 --> 00:07:21,907
NOW WE GOT A--SHOULD BE

251
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:23,442
UP TO 120 VOLTS.

252
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:25,077
JUST A MATTER NOW OF JUST

253
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:26,912
HOISTING THE AIR CONDITIONER UP

254
00:07:26,912 --> 00:07:30,349
INTO THE--JUST HOISTING HER UP--

255
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,383
JUST HOIST HER UP.

256
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:32,484
THERE WE GO.

257
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:37,122
[grunting]

258
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:38,390
ALL RIGHT.

259
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,559
NOW, THESE ARE--THESE ARE

260
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:42,260
A HEAVY UNIT, AREN'T THEY?

261
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,528
BY GOLLY.

262
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:45,697
[grunting]

263
00:07:49,034 --> 00:07:50,335
ALL RIGHT, AND THAT'S JUST GOT

264
00:07:50,335 --> 00:07:51,336
TO GET UP INTO THE WINDOW THERE

265
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:53,672
NOW, AND...

266
00:07:53,672 --> 00:07:56,942
[sighs]

267
00:07:56,942 --> 00:07:58,009
JUST WAIT FOR

268
00:07:58,009 --> 00:07:59,277
ALL MY BODY PARTS TO GO BACK

269
00:07:59,277 --> 00:08:01,780
INTO THEIR NORMAL SHAPE.

270
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:06,251
AND UP ONTO THIS--

271
00:08:06,251 --> 00:08:07,219
UP ONTO THIS--

272
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:10,522
[grunting]

273
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:13,692
I SHOULD'VE PARKED ON A HILL.

274
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:20,432
ALL RIGHT.

275
00:08:20,432 --> 00:08:22,734
THERE.

276
00:08:22,734 --> 00:08:24,035
NOW, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING

277
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:24,870
YOU'RE GONNA BE TAKING IN

278
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,604
AND OUT, YOU KNOW,

279
00:08:25,604 --> 00:08:26,738
ON A REGULAR BASIS.

280
00:08:26,738 --> 00:08:30,075
[panting]

281
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:32,244
ALL RIGHT NOW, JUST--

282
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:34,713
[groaning]

283
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:36,181
I DIDN'T THINK IT HAVE TO WEAR

284
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:37,015
AND THE EQUIPMENT TODAY.

285
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:38,984
BUT GET THE AIR CONDITIONER

286
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:39,818
INTO THE WINDOW.

287
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:41,886
[groaning loudly]

288
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:42,721
ALL RIGHT.

289
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:44,122
ALL RIGHT, LITTLE FARTHER.

290
00:08:44,122 --> 00:08:44,923
HONESTLY, IT TAKES

291
00:08:44,923 --> 00:08:45,690
A LITTLE TOUCH HERE,

292
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,958
A LITTLE--NOW JUST FIND THE

293
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,326
POINT JUST WHERE IT BALANCES.

294
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:51,096
OH.

295
00:08:52,697 --> 00:08:54,065
ALL RIGHT, WELL, IGNORE

296
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:56,267
THAT PART, BUT OTHER THAN THAT,

297
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:58,069
A HECK OF AN IDEA.

298
00:08:58,069 --> 00:08:59,804
OKAY, SO YOU GET THE IDEA.

299
00:08:59,804 --> 00:09:01,206
UNTIL NEXT TIME, IF THE WOMEN

300
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:02,440
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME, THEY

301
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,877
SHOULD AT LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

302
00:09:05,877 --> 00:09:07,178
YOU KNOW, I GOT ENOUGH THERE TO

303
00:09:07,178 --> 00:09:10,882
MAKE A HEAT PUMP FOR THE VAN.

304
00:09:10,882 --> 00:09:12,283
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK

305
00:09:12,283 --> 00:09:13,618
WITH THE REST OF THE STORY ABOUT

306
00:09:13,618 --> 00:09:14,786
THE MYSTERIOUS RUNNING SHOE

307
00:09:14,786 --> 00:09:15,754
RIGHT AFTER THESE MESSAGES.

308
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:16,688
>> AND LOTS OF OTHER THINGS TOO,

309
00:09:16,688 --> 00:09:17,389
JUST IN CASE

310
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:18,056
YOU WEREN'T INTERESTED

311
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:20,058
IN THAT RUNNING SHOE THING.

312
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:22,027
JUST SAY.

313
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:38,777
>> "IT IS AUTUMN.

314
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:39,944
YOU SEE A PILE OF LEAVES

315
00:09:39,944 --> 00:09:40,779
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE

316
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:42,080
OF YOUR FRONT LAWN.

317
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,481
THEY WEREN'T THERE YESTERDAY.

318
00:09:43,481 --> 00:09:44,616
THEY WON'T BE THERE TOMORROW.

319
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:46,317
AND SO YOU RUN AND JUMP

320
00:09:46,317 --> 00:09:48,186
HEADFIRST INTO THE PILE.

321
00:09:48,186 --> 00:09:49,154
AND THEN YOU REMEMBER

322
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:50,555
WHAT WAS HERE YESTERDAY

323
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:52,423
AND WILL BE HERE TOMORROW:

324
00:09:52,423 --> 00:09:54,459
THE FIRE HYDRANT."

325
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:59,697
SO AS I WAS SAYING, IT WASN'T

326
00:09:59,697 --> 00:10:00,632
STINKY'S RUNNING SHOE

327
00:10:00,632 --> 00:10:01,566
IN THE CHILI AT ALL,

328
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:03,201
BECAUSE STINKY WEARS

329
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:04,469
RUBBER BOOTS TO SQUASH THE

330
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:06,371
KIDNEY BEANS, AND THAT WAY,

331
00:10:06,371 --> 00:10:08,640
IT CLEANS THE BAIT OFF OF 'EM.

332
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,874
THEN WE THOUGHT, "WELL, MAYBE

333
00:10:09,874 --> 00:10:10,808
IT'D BE MOOSE THOMPSON'S."

334
00:10:10,808 --> 00:10:11,576
BUT NO, THOUGH,

335
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:12,744
'CAUSE THE SHOE HAD LACES,

336
00:10:12,744 --> 00:10:14,412
AND MOOSE DOES NOT HAVE

337
00:10:14,412 --> 00:10:15,680
THE KIND OF FIGURE WHERE HE CAN

338
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,982
REACH HIS FEET WITHOUT HELP.

339
00:10:17,982 --> 00:10:19,617
AND BESIDES, MOOSE HAS REALLY

340
00:10:19,617 --> 00:10:20,552
NOT BENT OVER

341
00:10:20,552 --> 00:10:21,586
SINCE HIS DAYS IN THE ARMY,

342
00:10:21,586 --> 00:10:23,187
WHICH WE HOPE IS JUST

343
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:24,188
A COINCIDENCE.

344
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:25,189
>> JUST TELL 'EM WHOSE SHOE

345
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:26,057
IT IS, UNCLE RED,

346
00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:27,025
'CAUSE WE'RE LOSIN' 'EM.

347
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:27,892
HURRY UP, GO.

348
00:10:27,892 --> 00:10:29,294
THAT'S--THAT'S, YOU KNOW,

349
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:31,629
MY OPINION.

350
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:32,764
>> FOUND OUT IT WAS

351
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:33,765
OLD MAN SEDGEWICK'S SHOE.

352
00:10:33,765 --> 00:10:34,432
>> OKAY, GOOD.

353
00:10:34,432 --> 00:10:35,800
ROLL THE NEXT INSERT!

354
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,302
>> BUT OLD MAN SEDGEWICK HADN'T

355
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:38,369
PUT IT IN THE CHILI, SO THIS IS

356
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:39,504
WHERE THE MYSTERY COMES IN.

357
00:10:39,504 --> 00:10:40,605
I MEAN, IT COULDN'T HAVE JUST

358
00:10:40,605 --> 00:10:41,539
CRAWLED IN THERE.

359
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:42,407
OR COULD IT?

360
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:43,308
>> READY TO ROLL THE PRE-TAPED

361
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:44,008
INSERT?

362
00:10:44,008 --> 00:10:45,143
OKAY, GREAT.

363
00:10:45,143 --> 00:10:45,977
GO. GO.

364
00:10:45,977 --> 00:10:46,911
[laughs]

365
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,979
I LOVE THIS SENSE OF POWER.

366
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:48,680
I REALLY DO.

367
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,747
[laughs]

368
00:10:49,747 --> 00:10:50,782
>> SEE, THE THING WAS THAT

369
00:10:50,782 --> 00:10:51,716
OLD MAN SEDGEWICK HADN'T REALLY

370
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:52,650
SEEN THE RUNNING SHOE

371
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,118
SINCE ABOUT TWO YEARS EARLIER

372
00:10:54,118 --> 00:10:55,253
WHEN HE WAS AT THE UNITED CHURCH

373
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:56,287
BADMINTON TOURNAMENT

374
00:10:56,287 --> 00:10:57,188
AND HE GOT INTO THE PUNCH

375
00:10:57,188 --> 00:10:58,456
IN A BIG WAY, FELL ON

376
00:10:58,456 --> 00:10:59,424
HIS RACKET, AND COME HOME

377
00:10:59,424 --> 00:11:00,591
WITH A CRUSHED BIRD.

378
00:11:00,591 --> 00:11:01,726
>> UNCLE RED,

379
00:11:01,726 --> 00:11:02,827
I'M NOT ON YOU ANYMORE.

380
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:03,995
WE'RE INTO THE NEXT SEGMENT,

381
00:11:03,995 --> 00:11:05,930
WELL INTO IT.

382
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,366
>> WE'RE OUT HERE ON LOCATION ON

383
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:10,234
WHAT THEY CALL A LOCATION SHOOT,

384
00:11:10,234 --> 00:11:11,903
AND I GOT MY GOOD FRIEND

385
00:11:11,903 --> 00:11:13,171
DOUGIE FRANKLIN HERE.

386
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:14,539
AND, YOU KNOW, DOUGIE, THEY

387
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:16,007
ALWAYS SAY YOU CAN JUDGE A MAN

388
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:17,041
BY THE SHINE ON HIS TRUCK.

389
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,609
>> I APPRECIATE THAT, RED.

390
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:19,777
THANK YOU KINDLY.

391
00:11:19,777 --> 00:11:21,379
>> YOU KNOW, DOUGIE HERE HAS GOT

392
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:22,080
QUITE A VEHICLE.

393
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,147
GOT A LOT OF SPECIAL EQUIPMENT

394
00:11:23,147 --> 00:11:23,948
ON IT.

395
00:11:23,948 --> 00:11:25,183
AND, DOUG, I KNOW A LOT OF OUR

396
00:11:25,183 --> 00:11:26,851
VIEWERS WOULD LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT

397
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:28,352
THE SPECIAL EQUIPMENT.

398
00:11:28,352 --> 00:11:29,153
SO MAYBE, DOUG,

399
00:11:29,153 --> 00:11:29,854
YOU COULD TELL US ABOUT

400
00:11:29,854 --> 00:11:30,755
SOME OF THE SPECIAL EQUIPMENT

401
00:11:30,755 --> 00:11:31,722
THAT YOU HAVE.

402
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:32,857
>> I CAN DO THAT FOR YOU, RED.

403
00:11:32,857 --> 00:11:33,624
>> ALL RIGHT, GOOD.

404
00:11:33,624 --> 00:11:34,959
>> WELL, WE'LL START RIGHT BACK

405
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:35,893
AT THE TOP THERE.

406
00:11:35,893 --> 00:11:37,628
ABOUT THE ONLY ORIGINAL THING ON

407
00:11:37,628 --> 00:11:38,729
THIS FROM THE GUY WHO BUILT HER

408
00:11:38,729 --> 00:11:39,964
WAS THE WINDSHIELD.

409
00:11:39,964 --> 00:11:41,299
AND THEN HE DISCOVERED WOMEN,

410
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:43,067
AND THAT'S--

411
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:44,335
>> IT HAPPENS, DOUG.

412
00:11:44,335 --> 00:11:45,169
>> IT DOES.

413
00:11:45,169 --> 00:11:46,037
THAT'S HOW I GOT THE TRUCK.

414
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:46,737
>> YEAH.

415
00:11:46,737 --> 00:11:48,072
>> ANYWAY, WITH THE--WITH THE

416
00:11:48,072 --> 00:11:49,073

417
00:11:49,073 --> 00:11:51,242
MIND, SHE'S GONE NOW--

LOAD LIFTERS, LOAD LIMITERS.

424

THIS BABY, SHE'S FULLY LOADED

425
00:12:03,588 --> 00:12:04,655
WITH A QUAD.

426

AND I PUT IN THE PREDATOR

441

WITH, UH--WITH THE CARBURETORS.

466

00:12:55,206 --> 00:12:56,307
>> OH, NO.

468
00:12:56,307 --> 00:12:57,775
WELL, YOU SAID THE POWER PLANT.

469
00:12:57,775 --> 00:12:58,642
IS THAT THE ENGINE?

OR A PRIVATE SCHOOL,

483
00:13:16,594 --> 00:13:17,895
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

484
00:13:17,895 --> 00:13:18,863
WOULDN'T WANT TO TAKE HER

485
00:13:18,863 --> 00:13:19,563

DOUG.

491
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:26,370
A LOT OF OUR VIEWERS MAYBE

00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,171
DON'T KNOW WHAT A TON--

493

00:13:33,277 --> 00:13:34,478
NOW, SHE'LL DO 100 MILE AN HOUR

499
00:13:34,478 --> 00:13:35,312

503
00:13:39,283 --> 00:13:40,117

ACTUALLY RUN THIS BABY ON

511
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:51,095
TESTOSTERONE, BUT, YOU KNOW,

512
00:13:51,095 --> 00:13:52,263
YOU CAN'T GET THE STATIONS

513
00:13:52,263 --> 00:13:53,063
TO STOCK IT.

514
00:13:53,063 --> 00:13:53,831
>> OH, NO.

515
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:54,698
>> THEY JUST WON'T STOCK IT,

516
00:13:54,698 --> 00:13:56,100
NOT EVEN THE UNLEADED.

517
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,101
>> OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

518
00:13:57,101 --> 00:13:58,235
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF MONEY

519
00:13:58,235 --> 00:13:59,336
TIED UP HERE.

520
00:13:59,336 --> 00:14:00,437
>> YEAH, I DO.

521
00:14:00,437 --> 00:14:01,372
>> WHAT WOULD SOMETHING LIKE

522
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:02,339
THIS--WHAT WOULD SOMETHING

523
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:03,307
LIKE THIS RUN?

524
00:14:03,307 --> 00:14:05,242
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.

525
00:14:05,242 --> 00:14:06,710
YOU LOOK AT IT AND GET MONEY--

526
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,279
DOLLAR SIGNS POP TO YOUR EYES.

527
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,847
THIS BABY'S WORTH PROBABLY

528
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:10,981
SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF

529
00:14:10,981 --> 00:14:14,652
ABOUT $765.26 A MONTH

530
00:14:14,652 --> 00:14:15,986
AS SHE SITS.

531
00:14:15,986 --> 00:14:17,121
>> THAT'S THE MONTHLY PAYMENTS,

532
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:17,922
DOUGIE.

533
00:14:17,922 --> 00:14:18,856
I WAS INTERESTED IN THE,

534
00:14:18,856 --> 00:14:19,790
YOU KNOW, ACTUAL FULL PRICE

535
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,025
OF THE VEHICLE.

536
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:22,660
>> UH...

537
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,994
WELL, YOU'D HAVE TO SPEAK TO

538
00:14:23,994 --> 00:14:25,229
THE BANK ABOUT THAT ONE.

539
00:14:25,229 --> 00:14:26,864
WHAT I DONE WAS, I--[coughs]

540
00:14:26,864 --> 00:14:28,999
I TOLD 'EM IT WAS A MOTOR HOME,

541
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:30,434
AND I TOOK OUT A 25-YEAR

542
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:31,502
MORTGAGE ON HER.

543
00:14:31,502 --> 00:14:33,570
AND, YOU KNOW, BY THE YEAR 2010,

544
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,638
THOUGH, QUITE A REASONABLE

545
00:14:34,638 --> 00:14:36,307
BUYOUT ON THIS BABY.

546
00:14:36,307 --> 00:14:37,241
>> WOW, GOLLY.

547
00:14:37,241 --> 00:14:38,242
SHE'S ALMOST BIG ENOUGH

548
00:14:38,242 --> 00:14:39,410
TO BE A MOTOR HOME...

549
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,244
>> YEAH, SHE IS.

550
00:14:40,244 --> 00:14:40,944
>> YOU KNOW, IF SHE HAD

551
00:14:40,944 --> 00:14:41,712
A TOILET, YOU KNOW.

552
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:42,613
>> OH, SHE'S GOT A TOILET

553
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:43,914
BACK THERE IN THE QUADS, YEAH.

554
00:14:43,914 --> 00:14:44,882
THE GUY BUILT HER

555
00:14:44,882 --> 00:14:45,749
PUT ONE IN THERE.

556
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:46,750
>> OH, FOR GOSH SAKE.

557
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,152
WELL, I'LL STAY UP AT THIS END.

558
00:14:48,152 --> 00:14:49,053
>> YEAH. [laughs]

559
00:14:49,053 --> 00:14:50,954
>> AND, DOUG, HEY, THANK YOU.

560
00:14:50,954 --> 00:14:51,789
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

561
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:52,723
>> RED, GOD LOVE YOU.

562
00:14:52,723 --> 00:14:53,490
>> ALL RIGHT.

563
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:56,627
OKAY, HAROLD, HIT YOUR BUTTONS.

564
00:14:56,627 --> 00:15:00,097
>> MY BEARD IS A TREASURE

565
00:15:00,097 --> 00:15:03,133
I WEAR ON MY FACE

566
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:06,136
IF I NEED TO HIDE THINGS

567
00:15:06,136 --> 00:15:09,106
IT'S A PRETTY GOOD PLACE

568
00:15:09,106 --> 00:15:12,142
IF YOU THINK HAVING A BEARD

569
00:15:12,142 --> 00:15:13,710
IS A DISGRACE

570
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,180
THEN WHAT ABOUT LINCOLN

571
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,314
OR SANTA

572
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:19,850
OR STEVEN SPIELBERG?

573
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,519
NOT TO MENTION THE FACT

574
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:23,353
THAT I DON'T HAVE TO

575
00:15:23,353 --> 00:15:24,555
GET UP EARLY TO SHAVE

576
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:25,255
WHICH MEANS

577
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:27,090
THAT IN MY LIFETIME

578
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,859
I'VE HAD ABOUT 4,000 HOURS

579
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:29,593
MORE SLEEP

580
00:15:29,593 --> 00:15:31,862
THAN MOST MEN MY AGE

581
00:15:31,862 --> 00:15:33,931
MM

582
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:39,369
>> OH, UNCLE RED, THIS IS GREAT.

583
00:15:39,369 --> 00:15:40,370
ANSWERING THE LETTERS THIS WEEK

584
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,371
IS GONNA BE SO EASY

585
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:42,206
AND SO MUCH FUN.

586
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:43,340
THESE ARE MOST EXCITING AND BEST

587
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,408
LETTERS WE'VE EVER HAD.

588
00:15:44,408 --> 00:15:45,576
THIS IS FANTASTIC.

589
00:15:45,576 --> 00:15:46,476
THIS IS REALLY, REALLY GOOD

590
00:15:46,476 --> 00:15:47,177
LETTERS.

591
00:15:47,177 --> 00:15:48,011
IF I'M ANY JUDGE OF LETTERS--

592
00:15:48,011 --> 00:15:48,879
AND WHICH I AM--

593
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:49,913
THIS IS A GOOD LETTER.

594
00:15:49,913 --> 00:15:50,948
>> JUST READ THE GOOD LETTER,

595
00:15:50,948 --> 00:15:51,682
WOULD YOU, HAROLD?

596
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:52,416
>> IT'S A GREAT LETTER

597
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,250
I'M GONNA READ, OKAY.

598
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,685
"DEAR RED, CONGRATULATIONS

599
00:15:54,685 --> 00:15:56,220
ON YOUR GREAT SHOW.

600
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,021
THE PRODUCTION AND DIRECTION IS

601
00:15:58,021 --> 00:16:00,924
WONDERFUL, VERY BERGMAN-ESQUE."

602
00:16:00,924 --> 00:16:02,025
>> BERGMAN-ESQUE?

603
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:03,126
WE DON'T HAVE STRIPPERS.

604
00:16:03,126 --> 00:16:04,361
>> NO, NO, NO, UNCLE RED.

605
00:16:04,361 --> 00:16:05,329
BERGMAN-ESQUE.

606
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:06,897
THAT'S LIKE INGMAR BERGMAN.

607
00:16:06,897 --> 00:16:09,666
HE WAS IN CASABLANCA.

608
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:10,901
>> OUR VIEWERS DON'T KNOW THAT.

609
00:16:10,901 --> 00:16:11,768
LET ME SEE THAT LETTER

610
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:12,502
FOR A SECOND.

611
00:16:12,502 --> 00:16:13,303
>> NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

612
00:16:13,303 --> 00:16:13,971
IT'S OKAY.

613
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:14,805
>> THAT'S YOUR HANDWRITIN',

614
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:16,006
HAROLD.

615
00:16:16,006 --> 00:16:17,174
WHY WOULD WE BE ANSWERING

616
00:16:17,174 --> 00:16:18,542
LETTERS WRITTEN BY YOU, HAROLD?

617
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:19,509
HAVE WE SUNK TO THAT?

618
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:22,079
>> WELL, IT--WE DIDN'T GET

619
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,181
ANY MAIL THIS WEEK, UNCLE RED.

620
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:25,315
UNLESS YOU GOT A LETTER.

621
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:26,016
DID YOU GET A LETTER

622
00:16:26,016 --> 00:16:27,985
OR A PHONE CALL OR ANYTHING?

623
00:16:27,985 --> 00:16:29,920
>> NOT THAT I RECALL, NO.

624
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,288
>> OH.

625
00:16:31,288 --> 00:16:33,256
DID YOU GET FAXED LATELY?

626
00:16:33,256 --> 00:16:34,658
>> WELL, I DON'T THINK WE HAVE

627
00:16:34,658 --> 00:16:35,592
TO TALK ABOUT THAT

628
00:16:35,592 --> 00:16:37,594
ON TELEVISION, HAROLD.

629
00:16:37,594 --> 00:16:38,729
BOY, THEY DIDN'T USE LANGUAGE

630
00:16:38,729 --> 00:16:39,496
LIKE THAT IN MY DAY.

631
00:16:39,496 --> 00:16:40,597
WHAT'S THE WORLD COMING TO?

632
00:16:40,597 --> 00:16:41,331
THIS WHOLE

633
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:42,199
"ANSWERING THE MAIL" THING'S

634
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:44,267
GONE DOWN THE TOILET.

635
00:16:44,267 --> 00:16:45,802
FOUL LANGUAGE AND FAKE LETTERS.

636
00:16:45,802 --> 00:16:47,671
>> WELL, I THINK ANSWERING FAKE

637
00:16:47,671 --> 00:16:48,939
LETTERS IS BETTER THAN ANSWERING

638
00:16:48,939 --> 00:16:50,006
NO LETTERS AT ALL.

639
00:16:50,006 --> 00:16:51,174
THERE'S NO SENSE HAVING

640
00:16:51,174 --> 00:16:52,409
AN "ANSWERING THE MAIL" SEGMENT

641
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:53,877
OF A SHOW WHERE THERE'S NO MAIL

642
00:16:53,877 --> 00:16:54,811
TO ANSWER.

643
00:16:54,811 --> 00:16:55,679
[laughs]

644
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:56,613
>> WHY NOT?

645
00:16:56,613 --> 00:16:57,681
WE TELL HUNTIN' AND FISHIN'

646
00:16:57,681 --> 00:16:58,849
STORIES, AND WE NEVER SHOOT

647
00:16:58,849 --> 00:17:00,117
OR CATCH ANYTHING.

648
00:17:00,117 --> 00:17:02,652
>> SHH!

649
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:10,894
>> THIS WEEK ON "ADVENTURES

650
00:17:10,894 --> 00:17:13,163
WITH BILL," HE WANTED TO GO

651
00:17:13,163 --> 00:17:14,998
ORIENTEERING, WHICH IS,

652
00:17:14,998 --> 00:17:17,634
YOU KNOW, KIND OF WALKIN' AROUND

653
00:17:17,634 --> 00:17:18,568
WITH A MAP.

654
00:17:18,568 --> 00:17:20,570
AND I WASN'T REAL INTERESTED

655
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:21,671
IN IT, YOU KNOW.

656
00:17:21,671 --> 00:17:24,040
MY FIRST REACTION WAS, "NO."

657
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,008
FIRST OF ALL, HE HAD THE MAP

658
00:17:25,008 --> 00:17:26,643
UPSIDE DOWN, WHICH TOOK AWAY A

659
00:17:26,643 --> 00:17:28,145
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MY CONFIDENCE.

660
00:17:28,145 --> 00:17:31,047
AND ANYWAY, I JUST DON'T REALLY

661
00:17:31,047 --> 00:17:33,416
ENJOY THAT TYPE OF THING.

662
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:36,486
BUT I WENT ALONG WITH IT,

663
00:17:36,486 --> 00:17:38,288
YOU KNOW.

664
00:17:38,288 --> 00:17:40,223
>> WHOA!

665
00:17:40,223 --> 00:17:43,093
>> I DECIDED NOT TO DO THAT,

666
00:17:43,093 --> 00:17:44,861
BUT, YOU KNOW, BILL SEEMED TO

667
00:17:44,861 --> 00:17:45,896
KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING.

668
00:17:45,896 --> 00:17:46,796
HE'S GOT THAT CONFIDENT...

669
00:17:46,796 --> 00:17:47,964
>> [grunts]

670
00:17:47,964 --> 00:17:49,232
>> YOU KNOW, AIR ABOUT HIM

671
00:17:49,232 --> 00:17:50,400
WHERE HE SEEMS TO BE IN CONTROL

672
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,201
OF EVERYTHING.

673
00:17:51,201 --> 00:17:52,402
>> [shouts]

674
00:17:52,402 --> 00:17:53,870
>> KIND OF MAKES YOU WANT TO GO.

675
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,871
NOW, WHAT HE WANTED TO DO WAS,

676
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:56,172
HE WANTED TO MARK THE TREE WITH

677
00:17:56,172 --> 00:17:57,540
A HATCHET HERE JUST SO HE'D KNOW

678
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,408
WHERE HE WAS.

679
00:17:58,408 --> 00:18:00,510
BUT THE, YOU KNOW, MAP BLEW UP,

680
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,178
AND THEN, YOU KNOW--

681
00:18:02,178 --> 00:18:05,015
WELL, I GUESS IT'S OKAY.

682
00:18:05,015 --> 00:18:06,149
AND HE'S GONNA TRY AND TAKE

683
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:07,317
THE HATCHET OUT OF THE TREE,

684
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:09,786
BUT--

685
00:18:09,786 --> 00:18:11,288
WELL, THEN HE DECIDED

686
00:18:11,288 --> 00:18:12,722
THAT'S A--THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD

687
00:18:12,722 --> 00:18:14,557
MARKER ITSELF, THE HEAD OF THE--

688
00:18:14,557 --> 00:18:15,659
HEAD OF THE AX THERE.

689
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:18,028
SO THEN WE JUST STARTED HEADIN'

690
00:18:18,028 --> 00:18:19,796
OUT, AND BILL HAD THE CANTEEN.

691
00:18:19,796 --> 00:18:20,630
WE HAD ALL THE EQUIPMENT

692
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,531
AND EVERYTHING.

693
00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:22,265
HE OFFERED ME

694
00:18:22,265 --> 00:18:23,066
A LITTLE DRINK OF THAT.

695
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:24,801
WASN'T BAD EITHER.

696
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:26,202
THE MAP WAS GETTING ALL WORSE

697
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:27,804
FOR WEAR, BUT HE HAD THAT

698
00:18:27,804 --> 00:18:29,072
FEELING AND HE THE BINOCULARS

699
00:18:29,072 --> 00:18:31,441
THERE, AND--AND HE HANDED THEM--

700
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:32,509
NO, BILL.

701
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:33,943
BILL. BILL.

702
00:18:33,943 --> 00:18:35,345
GIVE ME THE--YEAH.

703
00:18:35,345 --> 00:18:37,547
AND THEN HE'S BACK TO THE MAP,

704
00:18:37,547 --> 00:18:39,182
AND I--I MUST ADMIT I WAS

705
00:18:39,182 --> 00:18:40,817
STARTING TO LOSE MY CONFIDENCE.

706
00:18:40,817 --> 00:18:42,819
AND THEN WHEN HE ASKED US

707
00:18:42,819 --> 00:18:43,653
TO GET OUR COMPASSES OUT

708
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:45,121
AND COMPARE THEM,

709
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:48,425
THEY WERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

710
00:18:48,425 --> 00:18:50,927
NOW I'M STARTING TO REALLY

711
00:18:50,927 --> 00:18:54,130
WONDER WHAT I'M IN FOR HERE.

712
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,533
SO WHAT WE DECIDE TO DO IS JUST

713
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:57,967
TAKE A HALF THE MAP EACH,

714
00:18:57,967 --> 00:19:00,403
AND I'D ALREADY DECIDED

715
00:19:00,403 --> 00:19:04,507
WHAT I WAS GONNA DO WITH THE MAP

716
00:19:04,507 --> 00:19:07,210
AND THE WHOLE IDEA, REALLY.

717
00:19:11,014 --> 00:19:12,348
I FIGURED I COULD JUST FIND

718
00:19:12,348 --> 00:19:13,516
MY WAY WITH THE COMPASS

719
00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:14,851
AND THE CANTEEN

720
00:19:14,851 --> 00:19:16,553
AND THE BINOCULARS AND SO ON.

721
00:19:16,553 --> 00:19:18,521
BUT BILL WAS GOIN', I GUESS,

722
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:21,457
THE RIGHT WAY.

723
00:19:21,457 --> 00:19:22,258
AND, YOU KNOW,

724
00:19:22,258 --> 00:19:23,026
THE FUNNY THING IS,

725
00:19:23,026 --> 00:19:24,060
I KNOW I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THIS,

726
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:24,861
BUT, YOU KNOW,

727
00:19:24,861 --> 00:19:26,930
ONCE I GOT INTO IT...

728
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,064
>> YOW!

729
00:19:28,064 --> 00:19:29,899
>> I GUESS BILL WAS ENJOYING

730
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:31,067
HIMSELF TOO, YOU KNOW.

731
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:32,101
AND THE COMPASS WAS WORKIN'

732
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:33,836
FINE, AND I WAS MAKIN'

733
00:19:33,836 --> 00:19:34,904
GOOD TIME.

734
00:19:34,904 --> 00:19:35,572
>> [grunting]

735
00:19:35,572 --> 00:19:36,539
>> I FOUND THE WALKING

736
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:37,807
QUITE PLEASANT, ACTUALLY.

737
00:19:37,807 --> 00:19:40,310
NICE DAY, SUNNY, YOU KNOW.

738
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,078
NO REAL UNDERBRUSH OR ANYTHING

739
00:19:42,078 --> 00:19:44,013
TO WORRY ABOUT.

740
00:19:44,013 --> 00:19:45,782
I WAS WONDERING HOW BILL WAS

741
00:19:45,782 --> 00:19:47,417
DOIN' AT THIS TIME.

742
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:48,918
I WASN'T REAL CONCERNED.

743
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:50,587
I JUST WAS--I WAS JUST CURIOUS.

744
00:19:50,587 --> 00:19:51,754
THAT'S ALL.

745
00:19:51,754 --> 00:19:54,891
AND I COULD JUST TAKE MY TIME

746
00:19:54,891 --> 00:19:56,159
AND, YOU KNOW,

747
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:56,926
THIS ACTUALLY WAS GOOD.

748
00:19:56,926 --> 00:19:57,860
I WAS ENJOYING NATURE

749
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,928
A LITTLE BIT.

750
00:19:58,928 --> 00:20:00,897
I FOUND OUT LATER THAT BILL

751
00:20:00,897 --> 00:20:03,599
WAS HAVIN' SOME PROBLEMS,

752
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,403
BUT, YOU KNOW, HE'S A VERY

753
00:20:07,403 --> 00:20:10,073
RESILIENT, YOU KNOW, INVENTIVE,

754
00:20:10,073 --> 00:20:11,574
RESOURCEFUL KIND OF GUY.

755
00:20:11,574 --> 00:20:13,810
SOME THINGS DON'T BOTHER BILL.

756
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,378
AND, BOY, IT WAS A NICE DAY

757
00:20:15,378 --> 00:20:16,346
THERE.

758
00:20:16,346 --> 00:20:18,114
THE BINOCULARS, I CAN JUST SEE

759
00:20:18,114 --> 00:20:20,049
WHERE I WANT TO GO.

760
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:21,884
BILL WAS OKAY.

761
00:20:21,884 --> 00:20:23,419
I BELIEVE HE HAD A TELESCOPE

762
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:25,288
WITH HIM, SO I DIDN'T LEAVE HIM

763
00:20:25,288 --> 00:20:27,457
COMPLETELY HIGH AND DRY.

764
00:20:27,457 --> 00:20:28,191
YEAH, THERE IT IS THERE.

765
00:20:28,191 --> 00:20:29,225
LOOKS A BIT LIKE A THERMOS

766
00:20:29,225 --> 00:20:30,793
ANYWAY.

767
00:20:30,793 --> 00:20:31,994
BUT...

768
00:20:31,994 --> 00:20:34,997
>> [grunts]

769
00:20:34,997 --> 00:20:36,432
>> BOY.

770
00:20:36,432 --> 00:20:37,633
OKAY, WELL,

771
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:39,535
LUCKY IT WASN'T HIS GOOD EYE.

772
00:20:39,535 --> 00:20:41,170
I NEED TO STOP AND HAVE A DRINK,

773
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,472
AND, YOU KNOW, I WAS REALLY

774
00:20:42,472 --> 00:20:43,806
KIND OF GLAD THAT I HAD GONE--

775
00:20:43,806 --> 00:20:44,474
GONE ALONG WITH IT.

776
00:20:44,474 --> 00:20:45,875
I WAS HOPING BILL HAD SOMETHIN'

777
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:46,709
TO DRINK.

778
00:20:46,709 --> 00:20:47,744
YEAH, YEAH.

779
00:20:47,744 --> 00:20:49,612
OH.

780
00:20:49,612 --> 00:20:51,347
OH, WELL, BILL'S NOT HAVING

781
00:20:51,347 --> 00:20:52,915
A GOOD DAY, I GUESS.

782
00:20:52,915 --> 00:20:55,084
BUT, GOLLY, I WAS.

783
00:20:55,084 --> 00:20:56,252
I REALLY WAS, AND THAT'S REALLY

784
00:20:56,252 --> 00:20:57,587
ALL THAT MATTERED AT THAT POINT.

785
00:20:57,587 --> 00:20:58,354
>> [panting]

786
00:20:58,354 --> 00:21:00,823
>> BILL IS STARTIN' TO CIRCLE A

787
00:21:00,823 --> 00:21:03,025
LITTLE BIT, WHICH APPARENTLY IS

788
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:04,760
INDICATIVE OF SOMEONE PRETENDING

789
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,862
TO BE LOST.

790
00:21:05,862 --> 00:21:08,731
YOU KNOW, HE'S FUNNY THAT WAY.

791
00:21:08,731 --> 00:21:10,199
YOU KNOW, IF I'D HAVE SEEN HIM

792
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:11,567
THERE, OF COURSE, I WOULD'VE--

793
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:12,602
I WOULD'VE STRAIGHTENED HIM OUT,

794
00:21:12,602 --> 00:21:13,736
BUT, YOU KNOW, LIFE'S LIKE THAT

795
00:21:13,736 --> 00:21:15,271
SOMETIMES.

796
00:21:15,271 --> 00:21:17,607
AND STARTIN' TO MAKE PROGRESS

797
00:21:17,607 --> 00:21:19,709
HERE, 'CAUSE BILL EVENTUALLY

798
00:21:19,709 --> 00:21:20,943
COMES BACK TO THAT,

799
00:21:20,943 --> 00:21:21,944
AND LUCKY THING THAT HE LEFT

800
00:21:21,944 --> 00:21:23,145
THAT MARK IN THERE.

801
00:21:23,145 --> 00:21:24,313
AND HE DIDN'T SEEM REAL PLEASED,

802
00:21:24,313 --> 00:21:25,248
BUT TO ME, IT MEANT HE WAS

803
00:21:25,248 --> 00:21:25,948
AT LEAST GETTIN' BACK

804
00:21:25,948 --> 00:21:26,682
WHERE HE STARTED,

805
00:21:26,682 --> 00:21:27,950
WHICH IS WHERE I WAS

806
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,886
AND JUST WAITIN' FOR BILL,

807
00:21:29,886 --> 00:21:31,287
'CAUSE I WANTED TO THANK HIM.

808
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:32,655
I HAD A HECK OF A GOOD DAY.

809
00:21:32,655 --> 00:21:33,956
IT WAS JUST UNFORTUNATE

810
00:21:33,956 --> 00:21:35,958
THAT MAYBE HIS COMPASS WAS NOT

811
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,526
THE--NOT THE QUALITY OF MINE.

812
00:21:37,526 --> 00:21:38,494
MAYBE HE DIDN'T--YOU KNOW,

813
00:21:38,494 --> 00:21:40,363
DIDN'T PAY ENOUGH FOR IT

814
00:21:40,363 --> 00:21:41,030
OR WHAT HAVE YOU.

815
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,898
BOUGHT IT USED, MAYBE.

816
00:21:42,898 --> 00:21:44,967
BUT HE'S JUST GONNA--

817
00:21:44,967 --> 00:21:45,901
NO, CHUCK IT AWAY.

818
00:21:45,901 --> 00:21:46,602
CHUCK IT AWAY.

819
00:21:46,602 --> 00:21:47,303
THROW IT AWAY.

820
00:21:47,303 --> 00:21:47,970
TOSS IT.

821
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:48,871
GONE, OKAY.

822
00:21:48,871 --> 00:21:50,006
AND SOMETHIN' WAS HURTIN' BILL

823
00:21:50,006 --> 00:21:51,407
OR SOMETHIN' HE'D SAT ON,

824
00:21:51,407 --> 00:21:53,209
SO I WAS HELPIN' HIM OUT.

825
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:56,712
WELL, FOR GOSH SAKE.

826
00:21:56,712 --> 00:21:58,447
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

827
00:21:58,447 --> 00:21:59,515
THAT WAS THE PROBLEM.

828
00:21:59,515 --> 00:22:01,651
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST--I SAY

829
00:22:01,651 --> 00:22:03,319
JUST HAVE A LITTLE REST, BILL.

830
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:05,855
YOU DESERVE IT.

831
00:22:05,855 --> 00:22:07,556
GREAT DAY.

832
00:22:07,556 --> 00:22:08,691
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, AND I'M NOT

833
00:22:08,691 --> 00:22:09,692
EVEN GONNA MENTION

834
00:22:09,692 --> 00:22:11,127
THE RUNNING SHOE IN THE CHILI.

835
00:22:11,127 --> 00:22:12,028
>> [laughs]

836
00:22:12,028 --> 00:22:13,996
EXCELLENT CHOICE.

837
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:28,611
>> SO ANYWAY, AFTER DINNER,

838
00:22:28,611 --> 00:22:30,012
A WOMAN COME OVER TO THE LODGE

839
00:22:30,012 --> 00:22:31,647
AND TOLD US SHE'S THE ONE

840
00:22:31,647 --> 00:22:32,982
WHO'D ACCIDENTALLY DROPPED

841
00:22:32,982 --> 00:22:34,884
THE RUNNING SHOE INTO THE CHILI.

842
00:22:34,884 --> 00:22:35,885
APPARENTLY, SHE'D BEEN CARRYING

843
00:22:35,885 --> 00:22:36,619
THE SHOE AROUND

844
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:37,686
FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS

845
00:22:37,686 --> 00:22:39,388
AND TRYING IT ON EVERY MAN

846
00:22:39,388 --> 00:22:41,390
SHE MET, HOPIN' TO FIND THE GUY

847
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,758
WHO'D HAD HIS HANDS ALL OVER HER

848
00:22:42,758 --> 00:22:44,160
AT THE BADMINTON TOURNAMENT,

849
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,661
AND THEN THEY'D BE ABLE TO LIVE

850
00:22:45,661 --> 00:22:46,695
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

851
00:22:46,695 --> 00:22:48,230
WELL, WE KNEW

852
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,498
IT WAS OLD MAN SEDGEWICK'S SHOE,

853
00:22:49,498 --> 00:22:51,100
SO, GOD, WE WERE SURPRISED

854
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,101
AS HECK WHEN HE TRIED IT ON

855
00:22:52,101 --> 00:22:53,669
AND IT DIDN'T FIT.

856
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:55,337
HE TOLD US LATER THAT WAS

857
00:22:55,337 --> 00:22:56,472
BECAUSE THERE WAS A PIECE

858
00:22:56,472 --> 00:22:58,340
OF CELERY STUCK IN THE TOE

859
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,709
OF HIS SOCK.

860
00:23:00,709 --> 00:23:01,977
SEE, OLD MAN SEDGEWICK

861
00:23:01,977 --> 00:23:03,012
DOESN'T WANT TO GET MARRIED.

862
00:23:03,012 --> 00:23:04,146
HE WANTS TO JUST PLAY THE FIELD

863
00:23:04,146 --> 00:23:05,681
UNTIL THEY PLOW HIM UNDER IT,

864
00:23:05,681 --> 00:23:06,815
WHICH IS FINE WITH US.

865
00:23:06,815 --> 00:23:07,650
I MEAN, HE LOOKS LIKE

866
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,118
A SCARECROW ANYWAY.

867
00:23:09,118 --> 00:23:10,719
ANYWAY, IF MY WIFE IS WATCHIN',

868
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:12,054
I'M GONNA COME STRAIGHT HOME

869
00:23:12,054 --> 00:23:12,922
AFTER THE SHOW.

870
00:23:12,922 --> 00:23:14,223
SO I'D LIKE YOU

871
00:23:14,223 --> 00:23:15,357
TO LEAVE THE LIGHT ON

872
00:23:15,357 --> 00:23:16,525
OVER THE GARBAGE BAGS.

873
00:23:16,525 --> 00:23:18,194
I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT AGAIN.

874
00:23:18,194 --> 00:23:20,029
SO ANYWAY, THANKS VERY MUCH FOR

875
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:21,664
WATCHIN', AND ON BEHALF OF

876
00:23:21,664 --> 00:23:23,299
MYSELF AND HAROLD AND THE WHOLE

877
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:24,800
GANG UP HERE AT THE LODGE,

878
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,336
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.
