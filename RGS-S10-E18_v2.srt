1
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:06,506
YOU KNOW, INSTEAD OF
COMPLAINING ABOUT WINTER,

2
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:08,241
PEOPLE NEED TO
GET OUT IN IT.

3
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:09,509
YOU KNOW, HAVE A
LITTLE BIT OF FUN.

4
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:10,744
THAT'S HOW YOU STAY WARM.

5
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:13,480
SOME PEOPLE SKATE.
SOME PEOPLE SKI.

6
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,116
SOME PEOPLE GET NAKED AND
ROLL AROUND IN THE SNOW.

7
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:18,752
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, INSTEAD OF
BEING ON A COLD SNOW BANK,

8
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:21,421
THEY'RE IN A WARM POLICE CAR.

9
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:23,123
PERSONALLY,
I LIKE TOBOGGANING.

10
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,425
IN FACT, I LIKE IT SO MUCH,
I'VE IMPROVED IT.

11
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,794
WHAT I'VE DONE HERE IS I'VE
DUCT TAPED A FROZEN TURKEY

12
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,997
TO A COUPLE OF TOBOGGANS
GOING DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.

13
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,266
WE CALLED THIS A DOUBLE-ENDER
BACK WHEN I WAS DATING.

14
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,810
ALL RIGHT, NOW, THIS IS THE
ROPE THAT COMES UP FROM
THE TURKEY TOBOGGAN.

15
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,480
ALL'S YOU DO IS WIND THAT
AROUND SOMETHING SOLID AT
THE TOP OF THE HILL,

16
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,450
MAYBE A STEEL PIPE OR A BIRCH
TREE OR A FROZEN FAT GUY.

17
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,752
AND THEN WHAT I'VE DONE IS

18
00:00:52,785 --> 00:00:56,155
I'VE TIED THE OTHER END
OF THE ROPE TO THE BACK
OF MY TOBOGGAN.

19
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,424
I'M BASICALLY
READY TO GO.

20
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,094
NOW, I'VE SET UP THIS TOBOGGAN
JUST LIKE THE OTHER ONE,

21
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,929
EXCEPT THAT THIS TIME,
I'M THE TURKEY.

22
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:30,256
[ CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ]

23
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,701
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

24
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,202
APPRECIATE THAT.

25
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,872
WELL, WE'VE GOT A REAL BIG
DAY TOMORROW AT THE LODGE.

26
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,273
WE'RE HAVING A CANOE RACE

27
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,175
AGAINST THE GUYS FROM
CARIBOU LODGE.

28
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:52,211
SO, JUST GOT OUR EQUIPMENT
BACK INTO SHAPE THERE.

29
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:58,151
THESE CANOE PADDLES TOOK A
BIT OF A BEATING DURING
THE TALENT SHOW.

30
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,521
BUSTER HADFIELD WAS
TRYING TO JUGGLE THEM,

31
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,723
AND FORGOT ABOUT
THE CEILING FAN.

32
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,292
OH, GEEZ. OH!

33
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,162
( groaning and complaining )

34
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:11,764
RED, I'VE FOUND THE CANOE.

35
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,833
IT WASN'T WHERE
YOU SAID, THOUGH.

36
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:16,903
IT WASN'T BEHIND THE BACK STOP
ON THE TARGET RANGE.

37
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:20,973
IT WAS THE BACK STOP
ON THE TARGET RANGE.

38
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,775
ALL RIGHT, WELL JUST
LEAVE IT THERE, DALTON.

39
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,243
WE'LL FIX IT LATER.

40
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,879
WE'LL DO THE PADDLE'S FIRST.
JUST HOLD THIS, WILL YOU?

41
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:30,349
THINK THAT CANOE'S
GONNA FLOAT WITH
DUCT TAPE PATCHES?

42
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:32,285
WELL, NOT FOR TOO LONG,

43
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:34,220
BUT IT'LL JUST MAKE
YOU PADDLE FASTER.

44
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,824
HOW LONG'S THIS PADDLE
GOING TO HOLD TOGETHER?

45
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,092
THE SAME AS THE CANOE.

46
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,495
I FIGURE YOUR BEST BET
IS TO GO LIKE STINK

47
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,430
AND WEAR A BATHING SUIT.

48
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,166
OKAY.
THAT ROLL'S DONE.

49
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:48,868
SEE ANOTHER ROLL OF DUCT
TAPE ANYWHERE, DALTON?

50
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:50,536
NO, NO.
YOU MIGHT TRY
THE CUPBOARD.

51
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:52,738
THE GUYS ALL KNOW THEY'RE
SUPPOSED TO PUT IT BACK
WHEN THEY'RE DONE.

52
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:55,007
YEAH, RIGHT.
OKAY.

53
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,829
WE'RE OUT OF
DUCT TAPE, DALTON!

54
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,565
OKAY. OKAY. OKAY.
TRY TO STAY CALM, RED.

55
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,133
STAY CALM!

56
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,635
WE'RE OUT OF
DUCT TAPE, DALTON!

57
00:03:22,668 --> 00:03:24,904
OKAY, I'M GOING TO PHONE
THE HARDWARE STORE.

58
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:25,972
THEY'LL DELIVER
IT TODAY.

59
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:27,540
NOW,
WHAT'S THE NUMBER?

60
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:30,242
NUMBER ONE
ON THE SPEED DIAL.

61
00:03:30,576 --> 00:03:32,144
THIS HAS NEVER
HAPPENED BEFORE.

62
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:33,512
I MAY HAVE TO SHUT
DOWN THE WHOLE LODGE.

63
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:35,614
HELLO, THIS IS POSSUM LODGE.

64
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:37,116
WE NEED A DOZEN --

65
00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:38,751
TWO DOZEN!
TWO DOZEN!

66
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,053
OKAY WE NEED THREE
DOZEN ROLLS OF DUCT

RIGHT, YEAH.

68
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,957
WHAT?
WHAT IS IT?

69
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,159
(voice quivering)
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
THANKS.

70

THEY'RE ON BACK ORDER.
WHAT?

71
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:51,997
THEY WON'T HAVE
THEM FOR TWO WEEKS.

72
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,266
TWO WEEKS

73
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,335
WITHOUT DUCT TAPE.

74
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,170

HOLD IT TOGETHER.

75
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,905
HOLD IT TOGETHER.

00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:02,074
HOLD IT TOGETHER
WITH WHAT?

00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,185
IT'S TIME FOR THE
POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

78
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:22,862

250 POUNDS WORTH OF

OKAY, COVER YOUR
EARS, DALTON.

82
00:04:38,644 --> 00:04:40,679
OKAY, RED,
YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS

83
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:42,681
TO GET DALTON HUMPHREY
TO SAY THIS WORD...

84
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:47,019
YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
WINSTON.

85
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:48,387
AND GO!

86
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,055
OKAY, DALTON,
WHEN YOU GO TO BED

87
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:51,290
WHAT DO YOU DO
TO THE ALARM CLOCK?

88
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,359
UNPLUG IT.

89
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:56,161
OKAY, IF YOU STARTED BUYING
THOSE BEANIE BABIES,

90
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:58,530
YOU WOULDN'T STOP UNTIL
YOU HAD A COMPLETE...

91
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:00,666
FINANCIAL BREAKDOWN.

92
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,335
OKAY, WHEN YOU PUT SOMETHING
DOWN SOMEWHERE, YOU...

93
00:05:03,402 --> 00:05:06,372
FORGET WHERE IT IS.

94
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:09,174
THIS IS AN EXPRESSION
THEY USE IN A MOVIE.

95
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,776
THEY'LL SAY,
"QUIET ON THE..."

96
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:12,478
WESTERN FRONT!

97
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:14,046
YOU'RE ALMOST
OUT OF TIME, RED.

98
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,848
OKAY, DALTON,
AT SUPPERTIME,

99
00:05:15,914 --> 00:05:18,050
WHAT DO YOU DO TO
THE DINING ROOM TABLE?

100
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:19,852
PUT AWAY MY TRAIN SET.

101
00:05:19,885 --> 00:05:21,587
THAT'S IT!

102
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,255
[ RINGING BELL ]

103
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:25,324
WELL, THERE YOU GO!

104
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:38,670
THIS IS THE UP CLOSE AND
PERSONAL PART OF THE SHOW,

105
00:05:38,737 --> 00:05:41,874
AND WE'VE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO
FEEDBACK ON THE SEGMENT,

106
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:44,209
AND WE FIND THAT
VERY ENCOURAGING.

107
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:46,779
SO, TODAY, WE'RE GOING TO
TAKE A LITTLE CLOSER LOOK

108
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:49,548
AT THE MAN WE
KNOW AS ED FRID.

109
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:52,851
SO, ED, MAYBE YOU COULD TELL
US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
THE FRID HOUSEHOLD

110
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:56,588
BACK IN THE EARLY DAYS BEFORE
YOU BECAME AN ANIMAL
CONTROL OFFICER.

111
00:05:56,655 --> 00:05:58,791
OH, WELL, WE HAD A
GREAT FAMILY.

112
00:05:58,857 --> 00:06:00,259
EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT.

113
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:02,327
MOM, DAD, SIS, ME.

114
00:06:02,394 --> 00:06:04,730
WE HAD A A LITTLE HOUSE
AND A TIRE SWING,

115
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:06,732
A LITTLE WHITE PICKET FENCE.

116
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:09,301
IT WAS THE KIND OF
CHILDHOOD ALL KIDS WANT.

117
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:12,337
AT LEAST IT WAS
UNTIL WE MOVED.

118
00:06:12,404 --> 00:06:15,707
MOVING CAN BE VERY
DIFFICULT FOR A CHILD.

119
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:18,477
WHAT PART OF THAT
WAS TRAUMATIC FOR YOU?

120
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,680
WELL, IT'S HARD FOR ME TO
TALK ABOUT THIS, RED.

121
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:25,951
BUT MY DAD BOUGHT A
HOUSE RIGHT NEXT TO
AN ANIMAL SHELTER.

122
00:06:25,984 --> 00:06:29,254
OH, SO THAT'S HOW YOU WERE
REALLY INTRODUCED TO ANIMALS.

123
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:32,257
OH, NO, RED, THERE WERE
NO INTRODUCTIONS.

124
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:35,160
NO, THEY CAME OVER
WHENEVER THEY WANTED TO.

125
00:06:35,227 --> 00:06:37,296
THEY CLAWED THEIR WAY
UP OVER THE FENCE.

126
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:39,231
THEY'D TUNNEL THEIR WAY
INTO OUR BASEMENT.

127
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,667
THEY'D SLITHER INTO
OUR HOUSE THROUGH
THE MAIL SLOT

128
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:44,536
AND THEY ALWAYS CAME
RIGHT FOR ME.

129
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,839
YOU KNOW, MY FATHER COULD BE
ASLEEP ON THE COUCH,

130
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:49,575
IN HIS UNDERSHIRT,

131
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:53,245
BUT, OH, NO, THEY'D GO RIGHT
PAST HIM AND UP TO MY ROOM.

132
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,147
WELL, DID YOU TELL YOUR
PARENTS THAT THIS
WAS GOING ON?

133
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,015
WELL, YES.
YES, I DID.

134
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,017
THEY SAID I WAS MAKING
THE WHOLE THING UP

135
00:06:59,084 --> 00:07:02,688
TO EXPLAIN WHY
MY BED WAS WET.

136
00:07:02,754 --> 00:07:04,790
AND WERE YOU
MAKING IT UP, ED?

137
00:07:04,856 --> 00:07:06,625
NOT TOTALLY.

138
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:09,328
WELL, DOESN'T IT
SEEM ODD TO YOU

139
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:10,796
THAT A GUY WHO WENT
THROUGH ALL THAT

140
00:07:10,862 --> 00:07:12,664
WOULD END UP BEING AN
ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER?

141
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,533
NO, NO,
NOT REALLY.

142
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:17,936
YOU SEE, I DON'T
BLAME THE ANIMALS.

143
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:20,205
I NEVER BLAMED THE ANIMALS.

144
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:22,808
UH, IF THERE ARE ANY
ANIMALS WATCHING NOW,

145
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:25,043
I NEVER BLAMED YOU,

146
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,480
AND PLEASE DON'T HURT ME.

147
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,383
I'M JUST SAYING YOU
SHOULD HAVE MAYBE
BEEN A TEACHER

148
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:35,120
OR LIBRARIAN OR SELL
UNPAINTED FURNITURE
OR SOMETHING.

149
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:38,023
WELL, NOW, THAT WOULDN'T
SOLVE ANYTHING, WOULD IT?

150
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,193
BECAUSE ANIMALS CAN STILL GO
INTO SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES

151
00:07:41,226 --> 00:07:44,296
AND EVEN UNPAINTED
FURNITURE STORES.

152
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:46,865
THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO CONTROL
THEM, NOT HURT THEM.

153
00:07:46,898 --> 00:07:48,834
I NEVER SAID HURT THEM.

154
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:51,770
WE HAVE TO
MANAGE THEM AND,

155
00:07:51,837 --> 00:07:54,039
YOU KNOW, KEEP THEM
WITH FOOD

156
00:07:54,072 --> 00:07:56,141
AND A PLACE TO LIVE
AND KEEP THEM SAFE.

157
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,478
OTHERWISE, THEY MIGHT END
UP ATTACKING INNOCENT
PEOPLE IN BED,

158
00:07:59,544 --> 00:08:03,048
EVEN THOUGH THEIR FATHER'S
A WAY BETTER TARGET,

159
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:06,718
JUST LYING THERE IN HIS
UNDERSHIRT SNORING AND
REEKING OF PORK RINDS.

160
00:08:06,785 --> 00:08:08,820
OKAY. OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, ED.

161
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:10,489
WELL, WE'RE PRETTY MUCH
OUT OF TIME HERE.

162
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:12,457
SO MAYBE YOU CAN CAP THIS OFF
BY GIVING A BIT OF ADVICE

163
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:14,626
TO SOME OF THE YOUNGSTERS
WHO ARE WATCHING OUT THERE.

164
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:15,894
SURE.

165
00:08:15,927 --> 00:08:18,129
KIDS, YOU MAY FIND THAT THERE
ARE MANY THINGS IN LIFE

166
00:08:18,196 --> 00:08:19,564
THAT ARE VERY SCARY.

167
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:21,333
AND YOU MAY BE TEMPTED
TO RUN AWAY,

168
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:22,634
BUT DON'T DO IT.

169
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:24,669
THEY CAN RUN 10 TIMES
FASTER THAN YOU.

170
00:08:30,475 --> 00:08:32,744
GOT A REAL HUMMER OF A
TIP FOR YOU THIS TIME.

171
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:34,512
YOU KNOW IN THE WINTER
EVERYBODY HAS A FIRE GOING,

172
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:36,548
AND I'M THINKING,
WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT

173
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:39,684
IF YOU COULD USE THAT SMOKE
TO SEND SIGNALS TO YOUR
NEIGHBOURS?

174
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:42,287
IT WOULD COME IN REAL HANDY
IF, SAY, YOUR PHONE
WAS CUT OFF

175
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:45,090
'CAUSE, MAYBE, YOUR PHONE BILL
HAD ACCIDENTALLY SLIPPED
THROUGH THE CRACKS

176
00:08:45,156 --> 00:08:47,792
OF YOUR GARBAGE CAN LID.

177
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:50,962
SPEAKING OF WHICH, I'M LOOKING
AT THIS KITCHEN GARBAGE CAN,

178
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:54,899
AND I'M THINKING, HEY,
WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF I
PUT THIS ON TOP OF THE CHIMNEY

179
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:56,935
AND USE IT AS A
VALVE FOR THE SMOKE?

180
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:04,009
NOW, I TOOK THE PEDAL OFF,
AND I MOUNTED THE REST OF
THE UNIT OVER THE CHIMNEY.

181
00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:07,579
THEN I EXTENDED THIS ROD FROM
THE LID ALL THE WAY DOWN,
THROUGH THE ROOF,

182
00:09:07,612 --> 00:09:10,849
DOWN HERE, INSIDE, COMES
ALL THE WAY DOWN THROUGH
MY HOOK-UP,

183
00:09:10,915 --> 00:09:14,753
RIGHT UP TO THE FOOT PEDAL,
WHICH I'VE SITUATED BY
THE WOOD STOVE.

184
00:09:14,819 --> 00:09:17,422
SO BASICALLY,
I CAN CONTROL THE WHOLE
COMMUNICATION PROCESS

185
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:19,524
FROM THE COMFORT
OF MY LIVING ROOM.

186
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:21,359
PLUS, I GOT THIS
BOOK ON MORSE CODE,

187
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:23,528
WHICH'LL ALLOW ME TO CONVERT
MY FILES TO DIGITAL.

188
00:09:23,595 --> 00:09:25,764
SORT OF LIKE A COMPUTER.

189
00:09:25,797 --> 00:09:27,532
SO YOU CAN EITHER STAND
OUTSIDE TO GET MY MESSAGES,

190
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:30,301
OR YOU CAN USE WINDOWS
IF YOU HAVE 'EM.

191
00:09:30,635 --> 00:09:32,003
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GIVE HER A TRY.

192
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,605
SEE IF YOU CAN
UNDERSTAND THIS.

193
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,478
THE PEDAL'S COME OFF.

194
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,982
( coughing )

195
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:49,454
DID YOU GET THE MESSAGE?

196
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:52,056
( coughing )

197
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,169
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
CHANGES AS YOU GET OLDER

198
00:10:04,235 --> 00:10:06,604
IS YOUR ATTITUDE
TOWARDS PARTIES.

199
00:10:06,638 --> 00:10:08,940
THAT'S BECAUSE AFTER YOU'VE
BEEN MARRIED FOR A WHILE

200
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:12,610
YOU REALIZE MEN AND WOMEN
HAVE TOTALLY DIFFERENT
APPROACHES TO THEM.

201
00:10:12,677 --> 00:10:15,380
THE WOMAN WANTS TO KNOW
WHO'S COMING TO THE PARTY;

202
00:10:15,446 --> 00:10:18,816
THE MAN JUST WANTS TO KNOW
WHO'S BRINGING THE BEER.

203
00:10:18,883 --> 00:10:21,486
THE WOMAN CLEANS UP WHATEVER'S
LYING AROUND THE HOME

204
00:10:21,553 --> 00:10:24,722
SO THE GUESTS WILL THINK SHE
KEEPS A NEAT HOUSE.

205
00:10:24,756 --> 00:10:27,592
THE MAN WILL LEAVE TOOLS
LYING AROUND THE HOME

206
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,695
SO THE GUESTS WILL
HELP BUILD A DECK.

207
00:10:32,797 --> 00:10:36,467
THE WOMAN ALWAYS WANTS TO
FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH EVERYBODY;

208
00:10:36,534 --> 00:10:38,970
THE MAN AVOIDS
THAT INFORMATION.

209
00:10:39,003 --> 00:10:41,105
IT'S SAFER.

210
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:43,841
IT PREVENTS HIM FROM BLURTING
OUT SOMETHING HE'S NOT
SUPPOSED TO KNOW

211
00:10:43,908 --> 00:10:47,345
IN FRONT OF SOMEONE WHO'S
NOT SUPPOSED TO HEAR IT,

212
00:10:47,378 --> 00:10:52,016
ESPECIALLY IF THAT SOMEONE IS
CARRYING ONE OF THE TOOLS
THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER.

213
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,452
SO MY ADVICE IS WHEN
YOU GET TO OUR AGE,

214
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,654
STOP GOING TO PARTIES.

215
00:10:56,721 --> 00:10:59,190
BRINGING FRIENDS TOGETHER
FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE
OF LETTING LOOSE

216
00:10:59,257 --> 00:11:01,726
IS NOT A GOOD IDEA.

217
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,728
PEOPLE ARE LIKE
NUTS AND BOLTS.

218
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:07,031
THEY DON'T WORK
WELL LOOSE.

219
00:11:07,065 --> 00:11:09,600
THERE'S TOO MUCH PLAY.

220
00:11:09,634 --> 00:11:11,169
YOU WANT TO HAVE A WING-DING,

221
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:12,937
YOU'RE BETTER OFF IN A
BAR FULL OF STRANGERS

222
00:11:13,004 --> 00:11:15,139
THAN A HOUSE FULL OF FRIENDS.

223
00:11:15,206 --> 00:11:17,041
YOU WANT TO GO WHERE
THE LIGHTS ARE LOW,

224
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:18,609
PEOPLE ARE ALL THE SAME.

225
00:11:18,643 --> 00:11:21,946
YOU WANT TO GO WHERE
NOBODY KNOWS YOUR NAME.

226
00:11:21,979 --> 00:11:23,715
REMEMBER,
I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

227
00:11:23,781 --> 00:11:25,683
WE'RE ALL IN THE TOGETHER.

228
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:33,791
WELL, THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO
BE A SINGLE ROLL OF DUCT TAPE

229
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:36,060
IN THE WHOLE
POSSUM LAKE AREA.

230
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:39,730
I THINK THOSE GUYS
FROM CARIBOU LODGE
ARE HOARDING IT ALL.

231
00:11:39,797 --> 00:11:42,033
SO WE'RE FORCED
TO FIX THE CANOE

232
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:45,570
BY RECYCLING DUCT TAPE WE'VE
USED ON OTHER STUFF.

233
00:11:45,603 --> 00:11:47,772
I THINK IT'S GONNA
WORK OUT FINE.

234
00:11:57,648 --> 00:11:59,684
RED, I FOUND SOME
DUCT TAPE WE CAN USE.

235
00:11:59,717 --> 00:12:01,319
WOW, WHERE'D
YOU GET THIS?

236
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,696
DALTON, THIS STUFF
DOESN'T STICK.

237
00:12:11,729 --> 00:12:13,898
OH SURE IT DOES.
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

238
00:12:18,002 --> 00:12:20,071
LOOK, IT'S FINE.

239
00:12:23,507 --> 00:12:25,276
NO, DALTON IT'S NOT FINE.

240
00:12:25,343 --> 00:12:27,345
OH, YEAH, I'M GOING.
NO, NO, RED, DON'T DO IT.

241
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:30,214
I'VE GOTTA GO.
I'M GOING.
PLEASE, RED, NO!

242
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:31,949
DALTON,
THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.

243
00:12:34,752 --> 00:12:39,090
RED, NO ONE HAS BROKEN THAT
GLASS IN 50 YEARS.

244
00:12:39,156 --> 00:12:40,691
Mr GREEN!
Mr GREEN!

245
00:12:40,758 --> 00:12:43,160
I BROUGHT YOU
SOMETHING I THINK
MIGHT CHEER YOU UP.

246
00:12:43,194 --> 00:12:44,895
OH, MY GOSH.

247
00:12:44,962 --> 00:12:46,497
DALTON, MIKE BROUGHT
US DUCT TAPE.

248
00:12:46,564 --> 00:12:48,132
MIKE BROUGHT US DUCT TAPE.

249
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:49,734
WAY TO GO, MIKE!

250
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,636
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.
HOLD IT.

251
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,006
THIS ISN'T DUCT TAPE.

252
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:57,441
IT'S MASKING
TAPE PAINTED GREY.

253
00:12:57,475 --> 00:13:01,445
Audience: O-O-OH!

254
00:13:01,512 --> 00:13:03,481
IT'S NOT THE
SAME THING, MIKE!

255
00:13:03,514 --> 00:13:05,750
IT'S NOT THE SAME THING!

256
00:13:05,816 --> 00:13:08,686
WAY TO GO, MIKE.

257
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:12,356
AW, MIKE, SORRY I
SNAPPED AT YOU THERE.

258
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,293
I HAVEN'T HAD DUCT TAPE
IN OVER THREE HOURS.

259
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:18,295
GIMME THAT
HAMMER, DALTON.

260
00:13:18,362 --> 00:13:19,997
ARE YOU SURE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

261
00:13:20,064 --> 00:13:23,367
DALTON, WE CANNOT GO ON
LIVING LIKE THIS.

262
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,736
50 YEARS IT'S
BEEN THERE, MIKE.

263
00:13:30,808 --> 00:13:32,543
I GOT IT!

264
00:13:32,576 --> 00:13:33,878
WE'RE GOING
TO BE OKAY, GUYS.

265
00:13:33,911 --> 00:13:35,813
EVERYTHING'S
GOING TO BE OKAY.

266
00:13:40,618 --> 00:13:43,220
WHEN YOU SEND A SPECIAL
PACKAGE TO A LOVED ONE
OR WHATEVER,

267
00:13:43,287 --> 00:13:46,824
IT CAN BE VERY DISAPPOINTING
WHEN IT ARRIVES ALL BEAT
UP LIKE THIS,

268
00:13:46,857 --> 00:13:49,126
ESPECIALLY, IF THERE'S AN
EXPENSIVE CLOCK INSIDE

269
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,996
OR A SMALL ANIMAL
OR SOMETHING.

270
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:55,733
AND THAT'S EVEN AFTER YOU
COVER THE DARN THING WITH
WARNING STICKERS.

271
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:59,737
I TELL YOU, TO THEM,
"FRAGILE" IS FRENCH FOR
"THROW UNDERHAND."

272
00:13:59,803 --> 00:14:01,572
AND "THIS END UP" MEANS

273
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:04,542
THEY'LL DECIDE HOW
THIS'LL END UP.

274
00:14:04,608 --> 00:14:06,777
WELL, HERE'S A
DIFFERENT APPROACH.

275
00:14:06,844 --> 00:14:09,313
MAYBE THIS WARNING SIGN
WILL WORK A LITTLE
BETTER FOR YOU.

276
00:14:18,756 --> 00:14:21,125
ALL RIGHT, GORD?

277
00:14:21,158 --> 00:14:23,460
JUST GIVE
ME A MINUTE.

278
00:14:23,527 --> 00:14:26,797
BEEN SOME KIND OF AN
ACCIDENT OR SOMETHING?

279
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,232
YEAH, I'M GOOD.

280
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:30,234
NO. IT'S JUST THAT
DARN LIGHTNING AGAIN.

281
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:32,803
OH, BOY, THAT STINGS.

282
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,938
YOU GOT HIT BY LIGHTNING?

283
00:14:34,972 --> 00:14:36,507
I THINK SO.

284
00:14:36,573 --> 00:14:38,409
THERE WAS A BRIGHT
FLASH OF LIGHT

285
00:14:38,475 --> 00:14:40,944
AND THEN THE SMELL
OF BURNT HAIR.

286
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:42,413
SO IT'S EITHER LIGHTNING,

287
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:45,482
OR SOMEBODY THREW A SQUIRREL
THROUGH MY BUG ZAPPER.

288
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:50,154
WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE WHEN
LIGHTNING NAILS YOU LIKE THAT?

289
00:14:50,187 --> 00:14:52,322
WELL, IT'S
NOT TOO BAD.

290
00:14:52,356 --> 00:14:54,425
YOU LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS

291
00:14:54,491 --> 00:14:56,460
AND ABOUT 90 PERCENT
OF YOUR MEMORY.

292
00:14:56,493 --> 00:14:58,929
BUT IT'S INVIGORATING,
YOU KNOW.

293
00:14:58,996 --> 00:15:01,665
OH, BUT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER
NOT TO TAKE YOUR CLOTHES
OFF FOR A FEW DAYS.

294
00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:03,834
OTHERWISE HUGE SPARKS
LEAP OFF YOUR BODY PARTS,

295
00:15:03,901 --> 00:15:05,769
AND THAT CAN BE DANGEROUS.

296
00:15:05,836 --> 00:15:08,539
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE
SLOW DANCING.

297
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:12,142
I WONDER, GORD, IF YOU WOULD
CONSIDER GETTING OUT OF
THE FIRE TOWER,

298
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:14,711
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU
SEE A STORM COMING.

299
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:17,247
WELL, IT'S MY JOB, RED.
I MEAN, IF I LEFT THE TOWER,

300
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:20,517
LIGHTNING COULD VERY WELL
STRIKE A TREE AND START
A FOREST FIRE.

301
00:15:20,584 --> 00:15:23,253
YOU SEE, RED, TREES ARE
MADE OUT OF WOOD,

302
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,955
AND THEY BURN
VERY EASILY.

303
00:15:24,988 --> 00:15:27,357
I'VE LOOKED INTO IT.

304
00:15:27,424 --> 00:15:30,160
IT'S NOT YOUR DUTY TO
BE KILLED, THOUGH, GORD.

305
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:31,829
WELL, I REALIZE
THAT, RED.

306
00:15:31,895 --> 00:15:35,532
I'M VERY PLEASED
TO REPORT THAT I'VE
NEVER BEEN KILLED.

307
00:15:35,866 --> 00:15:38,969
I DON'T THINK YOUR BRAIN
CELLS GOT OFF THAT LUCKY.

308
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:41,004
WELL, MAYBE NOT,

309
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:43,106
BUT IF THERE'S ONE TREE
OUT THERE I CAN SAVE,

310
00:15:43,173 --> 00:15:45,409
WELL, DARN IT, THAT'S WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO.

311
00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:47,211
YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE
CALL ME CRAZY.

312
00:15:47,277 --> 00:15:48,645
DO YOU THINK I'M CRAZY, RED?

313
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:50,647
OH, FOR SURE.
YEAH.

314
00:15:50,714 --> 00:15:53,550
I LOVE THAT SENSE
OF HUMOUR.
I LOVE IT.

315
00:15:53,617 --> 00:15:56,420
ALL RIGHT, GORD, WELL,
IF YOU'VE GOT TO STAY
IN THE TOWER,

316
00:15:56,486 --> 00:15:58,355
WOULD YOU AT LEAST GET
ME A LIGHTNING ROD

317
00:15:58,422 --> 00:16:00,057
AND PUT IT ON TOP
OF THE THING?

318
00:16:00,123 --> 00:16:02,492
I HAVE A LIGHTNING ROD.
IT'S RIGHT ON THE ROOF
OF MY TOWER.

319
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,461
AND IS IT GROUNDED RIGHT
INTO THE GROUND?

320
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:07,197
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

321
00:16:07,264 --> 00:16:10,734
WELL, THERE'S SUPPOSED TO
BE A WIRE THAT RUNS
DOWN TO THE --

322
00:16:10,801 --> 00:16:15,305
WELL, HERE'S A WIRE.
WHERE DOES THIS GO?

323
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:18,809
WELL, IT'S ATTACHED TO
YOUR CHAIR, GORD.

324
00:16:20,744 --> 00:16:22,579
Red: ED FRID HAD CALLED
US OUT BEHIND THE LODGE.

325
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:24,748
HE'D LOST HIS PET GROUNDHOG,

326
00:16:24,815 --> 00:16:26,683
AND HE WANTED SOME HELP
FINDING IT.

327
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,985
AND WALTER WAS THERE.

328
00:16:28,051 --> 00:16:29,486
WALTER WENT ONE WAY,
WE WENT THE OTHER.

329
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:31,288
A LOT OF TIMES
THEY'LL DIG SEVERAL --

330
00:16:31,321 --> 00:16:33,690
THERE IT IS.
THERE IT IS.

331
00:16:33,757 --> 00:16:35,826
THEY DIG SEVERAL HOLES,

332
00:16:35,859 --> 00:16:37,894
SO WALTER WAS WORKING ON
ONE OF THE GROUNDHOG HOLES,

333
00:16:37,928 --> 00:16:41,965
AND WE DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WE
WERE WORKING IN ANOTHER ONE
IN CLOSE PROXIMITY.

334
00:16:41,998 --> 00:16:45,135
AND, OF COURSE, WE THOUGHT
WE'D GRABBED THE GROUNDHOG.

335
00:16:45,202 --> 00:16:50,006
OH, OH, TURNS OUT --

336
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,776
HE GAVE US THE SLIP.

337
00:16:54,878 --> 00:16:57,080
A LOT OF TIMES, THE GROUNDHOG
WILL STAY UP IN A TREE.

338
00:16:57,114 --> 00:16:58,882
LOOK AT THAT.

339
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:00,550
THEY SUN THEMSELVES.

340
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:02,886
SO ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS
GO UP AND GET THEM OUT
OF THE TREE.

341
00:17:02,953 --> 00:17:04,421
THIS IS SOMETHING
I DIDN'T REALIZE,

342
00:17:04,454 --> 00:17:06,022
THAT THEY LIKE
TO STAY UP THERE.

343
00:17:06,056 --> 00:17:08,525
I FIGURE ALL WE GOTTA DO IS
TAKE A ROCK AND JUST
A LIGHT NIP...

344
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:10,460
BUT ED SAID NO.

345
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:12,229
YOU'RE NOT DOING THAT.

346
00:17:12,262 --> 00:17:13,797
YOU'RE GOING TO HURT HIS
FAVOURITE GROUNDHOG.

347
00:17:13,864 --> 00:17:16,366
SO I JUST CHUCKED THE ROCK
AWAY, WHICH HE TOLD HE TO DO.

348
00:17:18,535 --> 00:17:21,138
THANK YOU, ED, FOR A
BRILLIANT SUGGESTION.

349
00:17:21,204 --> 00:17:24,174
SO, ED, WITH THE ANIMAL
CONTROL OFFICE HE
WORKS OUT OF,

350
00:17:24,241 --> 00:17:26,309
HAS ALL KINDS OF EQUIPMENT.

351
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:29,813
A BLOW GUN IS
REALLY WHAT IT IS.

352
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,982
THEY HAVE THE
TRANQUILIZER DARTS,

353
00:17:32,048 --> 00:17:36,653
WHICH GIVES THEM THE EXACT
DOSAGE FOR A GROUNDHOG,
APPARENTLY.

354
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,258
ALL HE WANTED WAS FOR US
TO CATCH THE GROUNDHOG
WHEN IT FELL.

355
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,126
CATCH THAT IN THE BLANKET.

356
00:17:43,193 --> 00:17:46,530
IT'D BE ASLEEP FOR A FEW
MINUTES, AND THEN IT'D
BE ALL RIGHT.

357
00:17:46,596 --> 00:17:49,199
ED GOT ALL SET THERE

358
00:17:49,266 --> 00:17:50,901
AND UNFORTUNATELY
HE INHALED.

359
00:17:58,108 --> 00:18:00,010
THERE WE GO.

360
00:18:00,043 --> 00:18:01,878
SO THEN, WALTER HAD AN IDEA.

361
00:18:01,945 --> 00:18:03,780
HE THOUGHT IF HE COULD
ACTUALLY GO UP THE TREE

362
00:18:03,813 --> 00:18:05,315
WITH THE DART AND
THE DART GUN,

363
00:18:05,382 --> 00:18:08,084
AND THEN HE COULD
GET A BETTER SHOT AT IT.

364
00:18:08,118 --> 00:18:10,153
IT WOULD WORK OUT BETTER.

365
00:18:10,186 --> 00:18:13,690
THEN ED AND I WOULD STAY DOWN
WITH THE BLANKET TO CATCH
THE GROUNDHOG.

366
00:18:13,757 --> 00:18:16,159
SO WALTER GETS HIMSELF
INTO POSITION.

367
00:18:16,226 --> 00:18:18,194
HE'S USUALLY A
PRETTY GOOD SHOT,

368
00:18:18,228 --> 00:18:19,896
BUT GROUNDHOGS ARE CAGEY.

369
00:18:19,963 --> 00:18:21,598
THEY'LL MOVE ON YOU
IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL.

370
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:23,867
SO HE GETS THE DART AND
GETS ALL SET AND SHOOTS.

371
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,069
THE GROUNDHOG DUCKS AND
THE DART HITS THE TREE AND...

372
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:28,405
OH!

373
00:18:32,142 --> 00:18:34,110
WELL, HE'S YOUNG
HE'LL GET OVER IT.

374
00:18:34,144 --> 00:18:35,645
SO I THOUGHT I'D
GRAB THE BRANCH,

375
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,847
AND I COULD PULL
THE BRANCH DOWN,

376
00:18:37,914 --> 00:18:40,316
AND WE'LL JUST GRAB THE
GROUNDHOG THERE.

377
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,018
BUT IT SEEMS THE BRANCH IS A
LITTLE BRITTLE AND --

378
00:18:42,052 --> 00:18:44,320
HE TAKES OFF AND HE'S WAY
OUTSIDE THE CENTRE LINE,

379
00:18:44,387 --> 00:18:45,688
AND IT LOOKS GOOD.
LOOKS GOOD.

380
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:47,057
LOOKS GOOD.

381
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,391
THAT'S THREE POINTS!

382
00:19:02,472 --> 00:19:04,941
IF YOU'RE A HANDYMAN,
YOU PROBABLY HAVE ONE
OF THESE SOMEWHERE,

383
00:19:05,008 --> 00:19:07,043
A BIG CAN FULL OF
NUTS AND BOLTS,

384
00:19:07,076 --> 00:19:09,379
PARTS LEFT OVER FROM THINGS
YOU'VE PUT TOGETHER

385
00:19:09,412 --> 00:19:11,247
OR THINGS YOU'VE
BLOWN APART.

386
00:19:11,314 --> 00:19:13,516
IT'S A LOT BETTER
THAN THROWING THE STUFF AWAY,

387
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:17,453
BUT WHAT A PAIN TO HAVE
TO SORT THROUGH EVERYTHING
WHEN YOU NEED SOMETHING.

388
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,423
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW,
THERE IS A BETTER WAY.

389
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,026
GET YOURSELF A RACK OF
THESE GUMBALL MACHINES.

390
00:19:23,092 --> 00:19:25,662
THEN PUT YOUR DIFFERENT SIZED
HARDWARE INTO EACH ONE.

391
00:19:25,728 --> 00:19:28,431
FOR EXAMPLE, SAY I'M LOOKING
FOR A HALF-INCH BOLT.

392
00:19:28,498 --> 00:19:30,533
I JUST TURN THE CRANK.

393
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:33,836
I NEED A HALF-INCH NUT
TO GO WITH IT.

394
00:19:33,903 --> 00:19:36,439
NO PROBLEM.

395
00:19:36,472 --> 00:19:38,341
BY GOLLY.

396
00:19:38,408 --> 00:19:40,109
AND HERE'S THE BEST PART,

397
00:19:40,143 --> 00:19:42,745
INSTEAD OF USING COINS,
I'M USING WASHERS, EH?

398
00:19:42,812 --> 00:19:44,914
I'M USING WASHERS AS SLUGS.

399
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,488
( muttering )

400
00:19:55,024 --> 00:19:58,027
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE
READY FOR THE CANOE RACE
EVEN WITHOUT DUCT TAPE.

401
00:19:58,061 --> 00:20:00,096
THE REAL HANDYMAN IS
RESOURCEFUL.

402
00:20:00,129 --> 00:20:02,098
WHEN THE WORLD HANDS
YOU A LEMON,

403
00:20:02,165 --> 00:20:05,068
YOU JAM IT INTO
A CANOE HOLE.

404
00:20:07,503 --> 00:20:09,405
WE GOT THE PADDLES
DONE, RED.

405
00:20:09,472 --> 00:20:11,240
YEAH, THEY TURNED
OUT PRETTY GOOD.

406
00:20:11,307 --> 00:20:12,909
YEAH,
WE'LL BE FINE.

407
00:20:12,942 --> 00:20:14,344
WE'LL PROBABLY
COME IN SECOND,

408

UNLESS THERE'S MORE
THAN TWO BOATS.

HEY, GUYS,
HOW'S IT GOING?

THERE IN YOUR HAND?

WAS IN MY POCKET.

NO, I MEAN IN
YOUR OTHER HAND.

414
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:31,594
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING THAT
LOOKS LIKE A ROLL OF
DUCT TAPE, THERE.

415
00:20:31,627 --> 00:20:33,262
OH, IT'S A ROLL

I DIDN'T KNOW IT
WAS GOOD FOR THAT.

420

WELL, THERE OUGHT TO
BE A COUPLE MORE
