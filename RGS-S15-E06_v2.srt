You know,
when you get married
there are certain things

2
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:06,606
that your wife would
prefer you stop doing,

3
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:08,041
like starting
at other women,

4
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,743
scratching yourself
in church

5
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,411
and the big daddy
of them all,

6
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:13,680
owning a motorcycle.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,750
To a woman a motorcycle
represents brain damage,

8
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,319
which she knows
you can't afford.

9
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:20,687
So here's the deal.

10
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,388
See, to a women,
cars are just cars.

11
00:00:22,388 --> 00:00:24,224
You ask a guy what kind
of car he drives,

12
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,159
he'll give you the year,
make, model, horsepower

13
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,894
and serial number.

14
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:29,696
You ask a woman
like Bernice,

15
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,499
she'll say,
A white one.

16
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,701
To most women,
car's are all the same.

17
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,537
So knowing that and having
an old refrigerator box

18
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,339
and a little
extra paint,

19
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,841
you can still get
your motorcycle.

You know, it's funny how you
get feeling sorry for
yourself sometimes

00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:12,372

somebody else

feel so much better, huh?

27
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,477
Like I was thinking,
you know,

28
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,245
we pay a lot for
gas in Canada,

29
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,248
and then today, I'm looking
in the Daily Movement,

30
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,118
and I see
an article there

31
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,188
that says Americans are
paying three bucks a
gallon for gas!

Oh no, no,
it's still bad,

but I'm not
in a hurry so...

40
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,507
I was just
telling everybody

41
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,710
that Americans are
paying three bucks
a gallon for gas.

42
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,013
Boy, that'd
be great, huh?

43
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:56,849
No, Harold,
you don't understand

44
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:59,185
we only pay like
a buck a litre.

45
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:01,988
Yeah, and how many
litres are in a gallon?

46
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:04,590
Well, who cares?

47

Oh, you will
in a minute.

48
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,961
There's four and a half
litres in a gallon

49
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:11,230
so we're paying
around $4.50.

50
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,266
Harold, you don't
understand.

51
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,134
It doesn't matter what
it costs in gallons

52
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:17,570

it in litres.

20 bucks worth in.

make the gas gauge
needle do?

Okay, but there was a time
that same amount of money

60
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:40,426
would make that
gas gauge go to full,

61
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:41,994
but yet today that
same 20 dollars

62
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:44,564
gives you a mere
five gallons.

That's the problem.

161
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,443
A lot of toy companies
have done real well

162
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:26,278
by taking things
from the real world

163
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:27,779
and then scaling
them down,

164
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:29,081
like cars...

165
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:30,615
or people.

166
00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:32,751
Boy, did he ever
get scaled down.

167
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:34,586
Whenever I see success,

168
00:07:34,586 --> 00:07:36,221
I try to do the
exact opposite.

169
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:38,757
So I'm taking toys
and scaling them up

170
00:07:38,757 --> 00:07:40,025
for the real world.

171
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:43,228
For example, I'm working
on a new way to climb
downstairs

172
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:46,398
using a coil of
1/2-inch copper tubing.

173
00:07:46,398 --> 00:07:48,767
And I'm biggie-sizing
this nerf rocket

174
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:53,038
as my design for an affordable
satellite launching system.

175
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,675
I just need to build a
size 9000 shoe full
of concrete.

176
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:01,179
But my ultimate
project is to design

177
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:03,281
an energy
efficient vehicle

178
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:06,284
that will take 10 feet
of backwards motion

179
00:08:06,284 --> 00:08:09,855
and turn it into a mile
of forward motion.

180
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:12,357
Okay, step one is to
get yourself all the parts

181
00:08:12,357 --> 00:08:14,125
that you're
going to need,

182
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,694
like, for example,

183
00:08:15,694 --> 00:08:17,796
well, you're going to need
a vehicle of some kind

184
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:20,398
and then you're
going to need --

185
00:08:20,398 --> 00:08:21,967
well, I'm going to have
to take this apart

186
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:23,869
to see how it works.

187
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:25,470
Just uh --

188
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:30,108
Okay, I'm going to
actually need

189
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:31,610
the greatest handyman
tool of all...

190
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,578
socialized medicine.

191
00:08:35,013 --> 00:08:37,182
The Doctor wanted
to x-ray my hand,

192
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:40,218
so I put the toy truck in the
machine at the same time,

193
00:08:40,218 --> 00:08:42,220
and I notice that there's
an elastic tube

194
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,356
running around
the axle.

195
00:08:44,356 --> 00:08:46,091
So I had to get something
big and stretchy.

196
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:48,326
Not as easy
as it used to be.

197
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:51,196
I went with these
jumbo tire inner tubes.

198
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:53,265
You can get these
pretty cheap.

199
00:08:53,265 --> 00:08:56,134
Just look for an abandoned
truck with a flat.

200
00:09:03,808 --> 00:09:05,944
I added an extra
rim back here

201
00:09:05,944 --> 00:09:08,613
so I'd have something
to attach the elastic to...

202
00:09:08,613 --> 00:09:10,849
and 'cause it looks sharp.

203
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:13,251
Don't spare the
duct tape on this job.

204
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:15,687
You don't want to be
smacked by this baby.

205
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:17,889
It'll make that wet towel
in the boy's locker room

206
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:20,091
feel like a love tap...

207
00:09:20,091 --> 00:09:23,028
which I hope it wasn't.

208
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:26,598
Now we just back it up
10 feet or so

209
00:09:26,598 --> 00:09:28,867
and then zoom
down the highway

210
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:31,503
without any
energy required.

211
00:09:31,503 --> 00:09:34,038
You've heard of hybrid
gas-electrics?

212
00:09:34,038 --> 00:09:36,341
This is a
hybrid gas-elastic.

213
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,489
Now you just put
her in neutral...

214
00:10:10,575 --> 00:10:12,343
This isn't....

215
00:10:16,681 --> 00:10:18,483
gonna work.

216
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,522
I needed a way to let
the elastic slip off

217
00:10:24,522 --> 00:10:26,190
when it gets to the end,

218
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,626
so I welded a bathtub
water spout on to the rim

219
00:10:28,626 --> 00:10:30,194
on a bit of
an angle here,

220
00:10:30,194 --> 00:10:32,397
and then I attached
a shower ring

221
00:10:32,397 --> 00:10:33,965
to the end
of my elastic.

222
00:10:33,965 --> 00:10:35,800
Now when I back up,
it'll hold,

223
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,902
but when I go forward
and it's slack,

224
00:10:37,902 --> 00:10:40,204
it'll just slide off.

225
00:10:43,474 --> 00:10:44,909
And it's just that easy,

226
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:46,477
the farther you want
to go forward,

227
00:10:46,477 --> 00:10:48,146
the farther
you go backwards.

228
00:10:48,146 --> 00:10:50,114
And speaking
of marriage...

229
00:10:50,114 --> 00:10:52,350
remember, if women
don't find you handsome,

230
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,686
they should at least
find you handy.

231

One thing my
father taught me

232
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,045
was the importance
of packaging.

233
00:11:21,045 --> 00:11:23,781
Packaging can make
anything look attractive,

234
00:11:23,781 --> 00:11:26,984
which explains
how he got Mom.

235
00:11:26,984 --> 00:11:28,920
Packaging is everything.

236
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,922
You know what else
is also everything?

237
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:31,956
Names.

238
00:11:31,956 --> 00:11:33,057
Look at cars,

239
00:11:33,057 --> 00:11:35,059
Mustang, Matrix,
Infinity.

240
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:38,062
I'm not sure why they're
allowed to call a car
an Infinity,

241
00:11:38,062 --> 00:11:40,998
if you can see
both ends but...

242
00:11:40,998 --> 00:11:43,134
Anyway, sounds good,
doesn't it, eh?

243
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:45,603
Or take soap: doesn't
Zest sound way better

244
00:11:45,603 --> 00:11:48,739
than animal fat
and chemicals?

245
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:50,708
Names are everything.

246
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,376
If they called

247
00:11:52,376 --> 00:11:56,380
exposures of pasty,
hairy legs, who'd buy them?

248
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,583
And bathroom tissue

249
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:02,186
sounds much classier
than its job.

Here's the beauty of it.

319

No matter where you are
within the town limits
of Possum Lake,

320
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:48,686
you're never more
than a 17-mile walk

from a golf cart.

When's the last time
you walked 17 miles?

323
00:14:53,724 --> 00:14:55,659
Hey hey,
I sit in the cart.

324
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:57,995
Bernice walks
to the mall, okay,

325
00:14:57,995 --> 00:15:00,764
and she also has
to walk back so she
doesn't buy much.

326

of that sucker

what he's eating.

330

He stuck the thing
right to his face,

331
00:15:15,946 --> 00:15:19,316
and Bill, I'd really like
to get fishing today sometime

No, no.
No thank you, Bill.

335
00:15:28,091 --> 00:15:30,027
So we're on our way

336
00:15:30,027 --> 00:15:32,830
and we go past one of
these wishing wells.

337
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,765
And you know, fishing is kind
of a luck thing anyway,

338
00:15:34,765 --> 00:15:37,568
so I'm thinking,
any kind of luck I can get

339
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:39,837
is certainly worth
a quarter to me.

340
00:15:39,837 --> 00:15:41,872
So I'm imagining a few fish
that I would catch

341
00:15:41,872 --> 00:15:45,042
and fire that quarter
into the wishing well.

342
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:46,977
Bill pulls out a quarter

343
00:15:46,977 --> 00:15:49,446
and he's imagining
world peace

344
00:15:49,446 --> 00:15:51,048
and, okay, a car.

345
00:15:51,048 --> 00:15:54,117
Uh-oh, uh-oh, Bill, stop!
You're thinking too much.

346
00:15:54,117 --> 00:15:57,354
But the quarter is
stuck to the goo,

347
00:15:57,354 --> 00:16:00,891
and, of course, his
watch comes right off
and goes down the well.

348
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:03,060
So then he wants me
to try to fish it out

349
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,761
with the fishing rod
and try to hook it.

350
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:06,430
And I said, that's a
pretty tall order

351
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,598
to get that down there.

352
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:09,866
Okay, plan B, plan B,

353
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:11,602
I've got to hold
the handles.

354
00:16:11,602 --> 00:16:13,203
All right, I see,

355
00:16:13,203 --> 00:16:15,205
yes, okay, he's going

356
00:16:15,205 --> 00:16:18,175
to at least get in
the bucket if not kick it,

357
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,777
and...

358
00:16:20,777 --> 00:16:23,180
He grabs on to the rope
and, of course,

359
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,748
unfortunately the handle,
at this point,

360

kind of let go on me

361

and it just broke
right off and...

362

She's a long
way down there.

363

Oh...

364
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:36,326
Okay, so you'll
be all right.

365
00:16:36,326 --> 00:16:38,128
No, he wants me
to pull him up,

366
00:16:38,128 --> 00:16:39,396
and I'll give it a chance

367
00:16:39,396 --> 00:16:41,798
but there's a lot of weight
and I've got no leverage.

368
00:16:41,798 --> 00:16:43,700
You've got to get a

shape for an older man.

00:16:48,538 --> 00:16:50,574
I was pretty
impressed with this

372
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:52,976
'cause he got
up right close --

373
00:16:52,976 --> 00:16:54,978
I should probably,
thinking back at it now,

374
00:16:54,978 --> 00:16:58,148
I probably should have
tightened that knot up
a little more.

375
00:17:03,954 --> 00:17:07,023
Okay, now plan C.

376
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:08,492
I'm going to drop
a rope down there.

377
00:17:08,492 --> 00:17:11,161
Now, Bill, I'm saying,
tie that rope onto
the other rope

378
00:17:11,161 --> 00:17:12,662
and then I'll
pull you out.

379
00:17:12,662 --> 00:17:14,197
And I was thinking,

380
00:17:14,197 --> 00:17:15,999
getting some mechanical
advantage through leverage

381
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:17,968
and a little help
from the Possum van.

382
00:17:20,337 --> 00:17:22,305
And now, the trouble
with the Possum van

383
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:23,974
is that she doesn't idle
all that smooth.

384
00:17:23,974 --> 00:17:25,408
So you're either
not moving at all

385
00:17:25,408 --> 00:17:28,678
or you're doing
in and around 80.

386
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:30,847
So that kind of got --

387
00:17:30,847 --> 00:17:32,349
A little fast,
but he's okay.

388
00:17:32,349 --> 00:17:34,084
He's okay, you know.

389
00:17:35,318 --> 00:17:38,455
Kind of looks like
Oktoberfest, doesn't it?

390
00:17:38,455 --> 00:17:40,924
But the fishing rod starts
jumping, which means --

391
00:17:40,924 --> 00:17:43,026
It's very rare to see
a fish in a well,

392
00:17:43,026 --> 00:17:44,895
but I pull it up.

393
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:48,098
Not only is it a fish
but it's wearing
his watch.

394
00:17:48,098 --> 00:17:49,366
So he takes the watch.

00:20:35,698 --> 00:20:37,333
and in order to maximize
my gas mileage,

474
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,669
I'll be coasting
as often as I can...

475
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:43,239
but then, coasting
is what I do best.

476
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:44,741
And to the rest of you,
thanks for watching.

477
00:20:44,741 --> 00:20:46,075
On behalf of myself
and Harold

478
00:20:46,075 --> 00:20:47,744
and the whole gang up here
at Possum Lodge,

479
00:20:47,744 --> 00:20:49,812
keep your
stick on the ice.

480
00:20:49,812 --> 00:20:54,851
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

481
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:57,253
Have a seat now.

482
00:20:57,253 --> 00:20:58,387
Sit down.
Sit down now.

483
00:20:58,387 --> 00:20:59,489
Time to sit down.

484
00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:00,690
Sit down. Sit down.

485
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,525
Everybody sit down.

486
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:06,462
All rise.

487
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:12,068
Quando omni flunkus moritati.

488
00:21:12,068 --> 00:21:13,736
RED: Okay, sit down.

489
00:21:14,704 --> 00:21:16,706
Bow your heads
for the man's prayer.

490
00:21:16,706 --> 00:21:19,642
I'm a man,
but I can change,

491
00:21:19,642 --> 00:21:21,477
if I have to...

492
00:21:21,477 --> 00:21:23,579
I guess.

493
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:27,617
Ah, men, I have nine
golf carts available

494
00:21:27,617 --> 00:21:28,885
if anybody's interested.

495
00:21:28,885 --> 00:21:30,519
No charge.

496
00:21:32,021 --> 00:21:33,789
HAROLD: He means there's
no electrical charge.

497
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:36,559
The carts are
100 dollars each.
