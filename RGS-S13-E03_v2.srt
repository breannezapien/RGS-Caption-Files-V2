1
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:04,137
As you can see, I got a bunch of roof trusses
here.

2
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:08,875
That's because sometimes when you do a job,
you overestimate the amount of materials

3
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,811
you're going to need and you end up with a
fair whack of it left over.

4
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:15,548
Not me, but that construction site up the
street here does.

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,383
I mean the roof, the whole house?

6
00:00:17,383 --> 00:00:18,985
They had all these left over.

7
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:22,489
You know, unless they're going to put a roof
on the garage, but who puts a regular roof on

8
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:30,897
a garage? The point is that a man my age
should be able to do something creative with

9
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:34,934
roof trusses. We know a little bit about
roofs and most of us have had experience with

10
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:40,106
trusses. The main thing to notice here is
all the triangles inside one of these, and we

11
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,108
all know how strong triangles are.

12
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:44,377
Remember your bicycle?

13
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:47,814
Remember how strong that crossbar felt when
the chain broke?

14
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:52,519
So just two triangles inside the trusses
that make them strong enough to hold up a

15
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,922
roof. So I figure they've got to be strong
enough to hold up a car.

16
00:00:56,689 --> 00:01:01,594
That's right, you guessed it with the help
of a little middle aged ingenuity and a roll

17
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,463
or two of the handyman secret weapon.

18
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:07,267
I'm going to show you how to get two
vehicles into one parking space.

19
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,918
Big, big week up at the Lions this week,
town councils decided to demolish the old

20
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:03,122
school that we all went to, and they're
asking for local tenders from anybody who

21
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:04,357
would like to rip it down.

22
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,826
And guess who got the contract?

23
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,696
Serendipity do died.

24
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:15,902
Hi, this has to be the best day of my life.

25
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:18,771
Mr. Green being asked to break and enter,
yes,

26
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,475
No more homework, no more books.

27
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,976
The whole darn school is getting the hook.

28
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,881
I'm going to knock down every corner they
ever made me stand in.

29
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,852
Actually, I blame my teachers for my life at
crime.

30
00:02:33,252 --> 00:02:35,521
You know, they flunk me so many times.

31
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:41,260
When I finally made it out of there, I was
tried as an adult, correct?

32
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:44,297
I just heard you guys are going to tear down
the old school.

33
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,165
Is that true? To my ears, deceive me.

34
00:02:46,732 --> 00:02:47,900
Well, they sure don't flatter you.

35
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:51,537
I know you guys know nothing about
demolition.

36
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,173
Harold, look around you.

37
00:02:56,275 --> 00:02:58,077
Yeah, OK, but I also heard you doing it for
free.

38
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,646
Well, that was the lowest tender.

39
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,783
Hey, look, don't be a wet blanket here,
Harold.

40
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,952
You've had enough wet blankets in your life.

41
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,989
We've got a job to do and we're going to go
do it.

42
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:12,391
Lean on Mike, why you're tearing the school
down for nothing.

43
00:03:12,391 --> 00:03:13,926
What kind of business deal is that?

44
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:15,861
Pretty good one because we are willing to
pay.

45
00:03:26,238 --> 00:03:28,674
This was.

46
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:44,457
Today's winner receives this coupon for a
free burger from Marty's Mystery Meat Market,

47
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:49,028
where if you can guess the animal you're
eating, we'll give you a free order.

48
00:03:50,529 --> 00:03:53,299
Ok. How are you? I hear things, Winston.

49
00:03:53,532 --> 00:03:57,670
Mr. Lee, you've got 30 seconds to get
Winston Rothschild to say this word.

50
00:03:58,704 --> 00:04:01,574
Carrier carrier.

51
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:04,043
And you're

52
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,982
Ok. Listen, when you first started high
school, you were encouraged to pick a desk

53
00:04:09,982 --> 00:04:12,818
near the front. Ok, no, no.

54
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:17,857
Ok. Your guidance counselor help you to find
a reason to hate guidance counselor.

55
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,726
Ok. Ok, do you now?

56
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:24,463
Sewage is not just a job, it's a privilege.

57
00:04:26,765 --> 00:04:27,900
Ok. Ok.

58
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:32,304
Let's say you have a job that you will never
lose, no matter how bad you screw it up.

59
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:35,207
Ok, then we call that a Senate appointment.

60
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:38,210
And we're almost out of time, Mr.

61
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:38,410
Green.

62
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,447
Ok, Winston, your dad, he's a real talker.

63
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,083
I want you to tell me what your mom says
about him.

64
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:46,051
Ok, let's say it, real slow.

65
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:49,121
She says he

66
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:51,490
Can talk her ear off talk career.

67
00:04:51,523 --> 00:05:01,200
I heard. Ed Rothschild's, our motto

68
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,703
is just do it, then call us.

69
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:13,612
You know, as a vehicle gets older and you
don't take care of it, it will eventually get

70
00:05:13,612 --> 00:05:17,282
too dangerous to put on the road like this
baby here.

71
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:22,221
No brakes left on her at all, which is a bad
idea in our area because we got lots of hills

72
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:23,455
and at least one lawyer.

73
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:28,661
But the engine is still good, you know?

74
00:05:29,695 --> 00:05:33,332
And it doesn't seem right to throw out the
whole thing when one part still works.

75
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:36,869
That'd be a dangerous precedent for any
middle aged husband.

76
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,742
So instead, I'm going to convert this
historic automobile into a one of a kind

77
00:05:43,742 --> 00:05:45,611
gasoline powered yard clock.

78
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:50,582
Step one Take off all the small pieces of
chrome trim.

79
00:06:09,468 --> 00:06:12,538
Ok, now you mount the little pieces of
chrome around the hood.

80
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:16,308
They're going to be the numbers on your
clock. Make sure it's a perfect circle.

81
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:19,211
Geometry is actually a big part of today's
handymen corner.

82
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:23,882
Next thing you want to do is drill a
precision hole exactly dead center in your

83
00:06:23,882 --> 00:06:33,425
clock. I did eventually find the center

84
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:35,360
and of a process of elimination.

85
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:40,165
Now this windshield wipers here while
they're on my, our hand and my minute hand,

86
00:06:40,165 --> 00:06:42,801
and then I've used this radio antenna as my
second hand.

87
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:46,305
But I really couldn't use anything off the
vehicle because it's a second hand car.

88
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:51,209
Ok, now this is the tricky part.

89
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:56,114
You got to find a way for the minute hand to
go 60 times slower than the second hand and

90
00:06:56,114 --> 00:06:59,051
for the hour hand to go 60 times slower than
the minute hand.

91
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:03,956
Now if I had to do that in my head, I know
I'd be looking at a very serious cranial

92
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:08,961
implosion. So instead, I took the workings
out of an old grandfather clock that Bernice

93
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:10,462
inherited and just used that.

94
00:07:11,296 --> 00:07:13,098
Besides, we always forgot to wind that old
clock.

95
00:07:13,632 --> 00:07:18,170
And now, with this gas powered unit, we
don't even have to then to get the engine

96
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:23,041
right on the clock. I placed a couple of fan
belts together, run them off the water pump

97
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:24,309
around this clothesline pull.

98
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,211
All right. Fire up.

99
00:07:34,586 --> 00:07:38,890
I bet everyone, the grandfather clock out of
harm's way, furnace gets a little weird

100
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,158
whenever I touch your stuff.

101
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:53,171
I got her sat two thousand r.p.m., for
starters, and I can just adjust from there if

102
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:55,941
it's the wrong speed. And I added a couple
of extra doodads.

103
00:07:56,208 --> 00:08:00,078
I put it in a couple switches at 12 o'clock
in the six o'clock position and then I wired

104
00:08:00,078 --> 00:08:05,283
them into the heart relay so you get a
signal on the hour and on the half hour.

105
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,556
And then I put another movable switch in
there, you can stick anywhere you want.

106
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,425
I put it right beside the nine o'clock
there.

107
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:16,962
That's the alarm. I got it wired into the
car radio.

108
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:22,000
I remember women don't find that handsome.

109
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:23,401
They should at least find your head.

110
00:08:23,501 --> 00:08:27,539
Oh yeah. One other thing, if the radio is
not strong enough to get you up, I added

111
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:32,010
another little feature mounted a little
teeter totter there beside the hour that I

112
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,814
want to get up at. And then I just balance a
little shotgun shell on.

113
00:08:36,848 --> 00:08:39,117
You'll notice I'm taking the air cleaner off
the carburetor.

114
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:44,389
There's a reason for that. This will either
wake you up or put you to sleep forever.

115
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:05,677
You know, with all the special effects
Hollywood has these days, they can make

116
00:09:05,677 --> 00:09:10,615
things happen in movies that would never
happen in life like, say, a young, good

117
00:09:10,615 --> 00:09:14,219
looking woman falls for a fat, bald, middle
aged guy.

118
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:16,454
That's a fantasy right there.

119
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:20,025
It's a fantasy that you just can't get in
the real world.

120
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:23,061
Well, OK, maybe you can get it, but it tends
to be expensive.

121
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:26,731
And usually leads to a couple of arrests.

122
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:29,834
One police, one cardiac.

123
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:35,573
Now, I'm not saying that there aren't any
young women who are attracted to us middle

124
00:09:35,573 --> 00:09:40,145
aged guys, but if you walk around, suck in
your gut in until you find them, you're going

125
00:09:40,145 --> 00:09:41,312
to wind up hunchbacked.

126
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:48,586
The younger women tend to like younger man,
that's because they can still sculpt and mold

127
00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:52,924
them. It's hard enough to wait until the
guy's mother is done with them.

128
00:09:52,957 --> 00:09:57,295
It's impossible if they wait until Mother
Nature has taken them into the late rounds.

129
00:09:58,997 --> 00:10:04,435
Because a woman sees a man, not as a man,
but as a do it yourself man kit.

130
00:10:06,204 --> 00:10:09,908
And nobody wants to play with a kit after
somebody else is glued it together.

131
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:14,812
Especially if they lost the directions and
wrecked the most important parts.

132
00:10:16,047 --> 00:10:17,182
Remember, I'm pulling for you.

133
00:10:17,615 --> 00:10:18,750
We're all in this together.

134
00:10:23,988 --> 00:10:26,291
Rob, sewage is just what you need.

135
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:29,661
You bite, we suck, everybody's happy.

136
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,937
Well, the town council gave us four weeks to
tear down the school.

137
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:40,538
We did her in twenty seven minutes.

138
00:10:43,174 --> 00:10:46,377
I'll tell you first time I enjoyed going to
the principal's office.

139
00:10:48,646 --> 00:10:51,249
Uncle Red, yeah, that was awful.

140
00:10:51,282 --> 00:10:55,820
Oh boy. You weren't supposed to pulverize
everything, the bricks could have been

141
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,554
recycled.

142
00:10:56,554 --> 00:10:58,790
Well, they still can here. I'll just add
water to the powder.

143
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,490
You got clay.

144
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:02,994
I feel like a man again.

145
00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:05,663
That was great.

146
00:11:06,064 --> 00:11:07,532
We better marriage counseling.

147
00:11:10,068 --> 00:11:11,269
Thank you. You're feeling OK.

148
00:11:12,003 --> 00:11:12,270
Yeah.

149
00:11:13,571 --> 00:11:14,305
No headache, really?

150
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:20,044
No. I do not get you guys.

151
00:11:20,211 --> 00:11:21,713
You just tore down a whole part of your
life.

152
00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:23,347
You're not the least bit upset about it.

153
00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:29,620
Can you not see that that school was a part
of each of you?

154
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:31,689
Well, I can see it was a part of Mike.

155
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:37,061
I mean, that place represents a time in your
life when you were when you were young and

156
00:11:37,061 --> 00:11:38,629
full of hope and promise.

157
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,465
This is not a happy day.

158
00:11:40,465 --> 00:11:44,202
This is a sad day. And if you had any
sensitivity at all, you'd be full of regret

159
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:44,869
right now.

160
00:11:45,536 --> 00:11:47,171
Harold, every time I see you, I'm full of
regret.

161
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:52,743
I mean, don't you regret things in life that
didn't turn out like like a marriage or a

162
00:11:52,743 --> 00:11:59,183
career or things you said, the things you
didn't say, things you should have said, but

163
00:11:59,183 --> 00:12:00,885
didn't because you were a man. It sucked it
up.

164
00:12:01,118 --> 00:12:03,988
So you missed the opportunity to tell your
dad how much you admired him.

165
00:12:04,388 --> 00:12:07,358
You missed a chance for him to tell you how
proud he is of you.

166
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:10,294
Things like that, Harold.

167
00:12:17,134 --> 00:12:19,170
He just wanted to be hugged.

168
00:12:20,671 --> 00:12:25,610
No, I had to settle for what I could get
wasn't good enough for daddy.

169
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:33,985
I just wanted a little affection.

170
00:12:34,752 --> 00:12:36,454
He said, I go blind

171
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,060
When you're a man, there's nothing better
than having a big steak

172
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,661
Barbecue.

173
00:12:43,694 --> 00:12:49,500
So Belinda brought the barbecue and went on
the man microshare and others, her behind the

174
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,935
coolers and.

175
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:54,672
You got to have the beverages, you know, and
actually, I think the meat was in there, so

176
00:12:55,072 --> 00:12:56,907
fails all the OK.

177
00:12:56,941 --> 00:12:58,909
The barbecue is not in pristine condition.

178
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:01,879
That's no problem. Got that lid off one way.

179
00:13:01,912 --> 00:13:05,416
There we go. And then go, Wait, wait.

180
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,051
And no, no, you don't need charcoal. This is
a propane.

181
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:09,620
It's a propane unit. You know, it's not new,
but it's still good.

182
00:13:12,156 --> 00:13:13,591
No, I'm wrong. It is a charcoal.

183
00:13:13,591 --> 00:13:15,359
It is a charcoal barbecue.

184
00:13:16,026 --> 00:13:17,828
So Mills and antibioticos.

185
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,533
Oh, boy. Come right out of her.

186
00:13:23,234 --> 00:13:24,535
All right now, that's good, that's good.

187
00:13:24,568 --> 00:13:27,505
And meanwhile, they're just set those down
on that table doesn't look.

188
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:34,145
Doesn't look strong enough to me, but I get
the barbecue starter from Mike, and I

189
00:13:34,145 --> 00:13:38,549
probably should have put this on on myself,
but you know, foolishly I had bill likes to

190
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:39,917
take over and he likes to.

191
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:41,218
He likes to put things in.

192
00:13:41,585 --> 00:13:43,053
And he probably over dinner a little.

193
00:13:44,755 --> 00:13:45,890
I'm just stepping back.

194
00:13:46,023 --> 00:13:49,593
Meanwhile, the Walter and Mike are getting
out, they still got some beautiful steaks

195
00:13:49,593 --> 00:13:53,364
there and and they kind of go up there
that's like we get the small, we got the

196
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:58,235
medium and then then they eventually get to
the large, which to me look like that.

197
00:13:58,235 --> 00:14:04,041
That picture in health of a couple of sets
along this barn that looks good.

198
00:14:04,642 --> 00:14:08,312
Meanwhile, he's put the hook on, OK, we're
now I'm bill.

199
00:14:08,312 --> 00:14:09,813
I don't. I'm not sure you should just throw.

200
00:14:09,813 --> 00:14:11,815
There's a lot of Cat Bailey, there's a lot
of gas.

201
00:14:11,815 --> 00:14:16,253
I think maybe you should just know he's not
worrying lately and now, OK?

202
00:14:16,253 --> 00:14:17,855
He thinks that's fine. But you know what?

203
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,424
He's not looking at the origin actually of
the flame.

204
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:23,827
So what do you do now, Bill?

205
00:14:24,628 --> 00:14:28,832
Mr. Smarty. All right, good know that works,
OK.

206
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:32,202
Meanwhile, we got all the meat.

207
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,638
Well, you know, why don't you heat up the
barbecue?

208
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:40,144
You might as well cook for the whole season,
and an odd thing about having meat, it seems

209
00:14:40,144 --> 00:14:43,480
to draw the flies. And just I don't know if
you're out there for two minutes and suddenly

210
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,915
you got the flies all over.

211
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:48,252
And we have a lot of flies in our area.

212
00:14:49,586 --> 00:14:51,388
I think it's actually the provincial bird.

213
00:14:51,955 --> 00:14:57,828
And that is going get the you get the flies
out of there and then they'll slap, that was

214
00:14:57,828 --> 00:15:06,236
a mistake. They're. Oh, and Mike, he had
been a drummer, was trooper in the early

215
00:15:06,236 --> 00:15:14,745
days. So he got it, and then they got me, oh
boy, he's snag one there, and then now

216
00:15:14,778 --> 00:15:18,515
Eleanor had the bug said, You know, that's
going to affect the taste, and he goes, Yeah,

217
00:15:18,515 --> 00:15:28,158
it is. So, but luckily, Bill had brought the
Bud Light, which apparently

218
00:15:28,158 --> 00:15:32,062
attracts the fancy plugged out in and out
and the flies, they started just migrating

219
00:15:32,062 --> 00:15:34,264
right over there, which is good. But you
know what, those?

220
00:15:34,665 --> 00:15:37,234
I can only handle so many flies and then
they kind of.

221
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:42,773
So, OK, so that was a problem, not the flies
are all coming back.

222
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:46,977
So they're starting to get on our body since
I'm so Mike grabs a chop and starts.

223
00:15:48,312 --> 00:15:51,548
And I guess you could say the thing about
vines is, you know, individually they're not

224
00:15:51,548 --> 00:15:54,785
that strong when you get a group of them
together and they have a fair amount of lift

225
00:15:54,785 --> 00:15:56,220
on them and they can actually take a stake
right

226
00:15:56,453 --> 00:15:58,288
Out here, right out of your hand.

227
00:15:58,355 --> 00:15:59,590
They're going to hang on there.

228
00:16:00,023 --> 00:16:01,458
You're losing, you're losing them.

229
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,060
Oh, man.

230
00:16:04,061 --> 00:16:05,395
And what happened next time?

231
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:07,231
I really can't describe.

232
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:12,569
I just. I cannot erase the memory of all of
our great steaks.

233
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:15,238
Levitating in front of our very eyes.

234
00:16:18,475 --> 00:16:21,812
If you see these flying over your house,
please call the lodge.

235
00:16:30,053 --> 00:16:34,124
You know, one of the strongest bonds in life
is between the man and his vehicle.

236
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:36,259
It's almost like, you know what each other
is thinking.

237
00:16:36,994 --> 00:16:41,231
Unfortunately, there are people in this
world who don't appreciate that quiet and

238
00:16:41,231 --> 00:16:42,265
intimate understanding.

239
00:16:42,265 --> 00:16:43,266
You know who I'm talking about.

240
00:16:43,867 --> 00:16:46,970
People have said over in this area here, I
tell you everything you're doing wrong.

241
00:16:47,537 --> 00:16:49,840
Hey, slow down. That was a stop sign.

242
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,110
You know, where are we, that kind of thing?

243
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:58,315
But the biggest dividing point comes when
this little light by the fuel gauge goes on,

244
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,586
the passenger starts going squirrely on you.

245
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:06,356
But you know you got 50 or 60 miles before
there's any real problem.

246
00:17:06,957 --> 00:17:08,759
Well, here's a way to keep everybody happy.

247
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:12,963
See, when that light goes on, it just means
there's not enough gas in the part of the gas

248
00:17:12,963 --> 00:17:14,197
tank where the switch is.

249
00:17:14,731 --> 00:17:19,169
So all you got to do is loosen off the gas
tank straps and then just tip the tank a

250
00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:27,511
little. The trick is we need a way to tilt
the tank from the driver's seat, and it's got

251
00:17:27,511 --> 00:17:29,946
to be something subtle that the passenger
won't notice.

252
00:17:30,614 --> 00:17:34,050
Now, sure, you know, if you're a government
engineer, you'd probably build some type of

253
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,487
hydraulic lift. But I don't have the kind of
free time those guys do.

254
00:17:38,288 --> 00:17:41,191
So let's see what we can make with the
materials that are available.

255
00:17:52,335 --> 00:17:54,971
I guess you could call this rigged public
enemy number one.

256
00:17:56,706 --> 00:17:58,041
The tube up inside the car.

257
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,442
I got it to the driver's seat.

258
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:03,380
But now I need something that will inflate
the rubber bottle and tilt the tank.

259
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,848
And look what I found.

260
00:18:06,283 --> 00:18:12,922
I won't be cushioned. Just my lucky day or
what I'm going to do is blow this baby up and

261
00:18:12,922 --> 00:18:16,259
then slip it over at the end of my feet or
tube and I'm in business.

262
00:18:22,265 --> 00:18:26,670
Ok. Got my whoopee cushion hooked up and in
place and completely under my control.

263
00:18:27,003 --> 00:18:28,071
So I'm driving along.

264
00:18:28,104 --> 00:18:33,710
I look down and oh my goodness, you laid it
off and the passenger started screaming,

265
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,879
Hey, look stupid, you're out of gas,

266
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,882
Out of gas. I don't think so.

267
00:18:51,161 --> 00:18:56,032
Well, this is great. Harold's got half the
lodge crying, say that a clean Kleenex shirt

268
00:18:56,032 --> 00:19:00,236
is going on here. What exactly is Dalton's
problem, Harold?

269
00:19:00,336 --> 00:19:03,740
Well, it seems when he was a boy, his father
gave him a chicken.

270
00:19:04,174 --> 00:19:06,543
Well, it was supposed to be a rooster.

271
00:19:07,744 --> 00:19:09,212
I waited for it to be good.

272
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:10,313
It was

273
00:19:10,313 --> 00:19:20,123
A level. Now.

274
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:24,027
What's wrong with them?

275
00:19:24,494 --> 00:19:27,630
Well, they got the crying flu and typhoid
Harold is the carrier.

276
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:32,068
Geez, I was so happy when we flattened the
school.

277
00:19:33,069 --> 00:19:34,604
No, I'm disquieted.

278
00:19:36,906 --> 00:19:38,408
Just as long as you don't start crying.

279
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,276
Oh, don't worry, Mr. Green.

280
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,411
I've been in the slammer.

281
00:19:41,444 --> 00:19:44,514
I've seen it all. Not to make me cry.

282
00:19:44,547 --> 00:19:48,718
No, no. That's what I vowed to myself.

283
00:19:48,785 --> 00:19:51,120
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that first night, huh?

284
00:19:52,155 --> 00:19:53,523
When the shadow door closed.

285
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,361
Yeah. Ok.

286
00:20:01,831 --> 00:20:02,165
Yeah.

287
00:20:13,443 --> 00:20:15,778
Anytime, anytime you go.

288
00:20:21,784 --> 00:20:26,089
Ok. If my wife is watching, I will
definitely be coming straight home after the

289
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:27,490
meeting, I got to get out of here.

290
00:20:27,757 --> 00:20:33,463
I haven't seen this many men crying since
they canceled Baywatch and the rest of us.

291
00:20:33,463 --> 00:20:38,000
Thanks for watching on behalf of myself and
Harold and the whole sobbing gang up here for

292
00:20:38,234 --> 00:20:40,069
lunch. He was stuck on the ice.

293
00:20:47,443 --> 00:20:48,311
You mean my

294
00:20:48,311 --> 00:20:51,614
Daughter, everybody sit down, sit down, sit
down, everybody sit down.

295
00:20:52,048 --> 00:20:54,150
Sit down. All right.

296
00:20:57,687 --> 00:20:59,622
Follow me on.

297
00:21:03,826 --> 00:21:07,430
Buy your hats for the mass prayer tie in,
little man.

298
00:21:07,864 --> 00:21:10,733
But I could change if I had to.

299
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:16,272
I guess. I mean, they had a little incident
here today.

300
00:21:16,806 --> 00:21:20,510
We knocked the school down and there was a
lot of dust and they got into the eyes and

301
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:23,279
some guys got teary eyed and Dalton here, he
got teary eyed.

302
00:21:23,646 --> 00:21:27,016
And I'm wondering, did anybody else get
teary eyed?

303
00:21:27,116 --> 00:21:28,451
Anybody can really get teary eyed.

304
00:21:28,784 --> 00:21:31,220
Ok? Yeah. So I thought it was just the dust.

305
00:21:31,254 --> 00:21:32,688
So it was just dusk.

306
00:21:33,055 --> 00:21:38,094
So from now on, whenever we do a job like
this, we're going to we're going to wear

307
00:21:38,094 --> 00:21:39,428
safety goggles. Ok?

308
00:21:39,595 --> 00:21:41,297
Yeah. Well, it did hit a.
