THE HIGH EXPECTATIONS

17
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:48,982
BUT THE LOW STANDARDS,

18
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,483
THE RISING PROFILE BUT

19
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:51,951

BIG, BIG WEEK AT THE LODGE

33
00:01:26,552 --> 00:01:27,720
THIS WEEK, JUNIOR SINGLETON

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,888
TOOK ALL HIS MONEY OUT

35
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:30,089
OF THE BANK AND BOUGHT

36
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,457
HIMSELF A USED HELICOPTER.

37
00:01:31,457 --> 00:01:32,225
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD

38
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,360
SELL SOMEBODY A USED HELICOPTER.

39
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,495
>>HAROLD: YEAH ESPECIALLY

40
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:36,462
JUNIOR, HE DOESN'T EVEN

HAVE A PILOT'S LICENCE.

42
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,097
>>RED: NO BUT HE HAS A BANK

43
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:40,066
BALANCE HAROLD AND I BELIEVE

44
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,135
THE INSURANCE ON A HELICOPTER

45
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:42,969
IS A LOT CHEAPER IF YOU

46
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:45,805
NEVER FLY IT.

47
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:46,606
JUNIOR'S REAL SMART WITH

48
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,374

>>HAROLD: BOY IT'D BE GREAT IF

50
00:01:49,308 --> 00:01:50,143
WE COULD GET SOME AERIAL SHOTS

00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,344

52
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:52,912
>>RED: WELL I THINK YOU'RE

53
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:55,081
GOING TO HAVE TO GET THOSE FROM

54
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,150
THE AERIAL BECAUSE A COUPLE OF

55
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,484
DAYS AGO JUNIOR WENT DOWN FOR

56
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:00,987
HIS HELICOPTER LICENSE TEST

57
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:02,155
AND IT WASN'T GOOD HAROLD,

58
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,322
HE FLUNKED THE ORAL TEST

59
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:04,290
HE FLUNKED THE WRITTEN TEST

60
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,324
HE FLUNKED THE EYE TEST

61
00:02:05,324 --> 00:02:06,259
HE WENT TO THE WRONG WASHROOM

62
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:09,462
FOR THE OTHER TEST.

63
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,196
>>HAROLD: WELL YOU KNOW WHAT,

64
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:11,030
I'D LOOK GOOD IN A

65
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,931
HELICOPTER HUH?

66
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:12,632
WOULDN'T I LOOK GOOD

67
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:16,369

79
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,921
IT'LL BE TO JUMP OFF.

'HANDYMAN CORNER' WE GOT

95
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:16,395
SOMETHING FOR YOU AUDIOPHILES

96
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:17,563
WHO COLLECT THE PHONOGRAPHIC

97
00:03:17,563 --> 00:03:18,764
LITERATURE WHICH IS NOT

98
00:03:18,764 --> 00:03:19,599
WHAT THE REST OF YOU ARE

99
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,334
THINKING SO SAVE YOUR MONEY.

100
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:22,134
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE US A

101
00:03:22,134 --> 00:03:25,871
C.D. PLAYER FOR THIS, THE C.D.

102
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:27,306
NOW HAROLD TELLS ME THAT

103
00:03:27,306 --> 00:03:28,507
THESE C.D.'S HAVE HALF

104
00:03:28,507 --> 00:03:30,576
THE HISS OF AN L.P. OR A 45

105
00:03:30,576 --> 00:03:31,744
OR EVEN AN 8-TRACK WHICH

106
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:33,145
I FIND HARD TO BELIEVE.

107
00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:34,146
UNFORTUNATELY THE C.D.'S

108
00:03:34,146 --> 00:03:37,750
COST ABOUT 9 TIMES AS MUCH.

109
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,151
IN FACT BY THE TIME YOU BUY

110
00:03:39,151 --> 00:03:39,919
A COUPLE OF THEM C.D.'S

111
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,655
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY LEFT

112
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:43,255
TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD THE

113
00:03:43,255 --> 00:03:44,256
C.D. PLAYER, SO WE'RE GOING

114
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:44,990
TO SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE

115
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:45,758
ONE USING YOUR COMMON

116
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:46,959
HOUSEHOLD TOASTER.

117
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,195
NOW THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE

118
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:52,732
TO DO IS GUT THE TOASTER,

119
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,600
JUST LIKE GUTTING A FISH

120
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,401
AND WITH THIS TOASTER,

121
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,335
IT'S PRETTY WELL MUNGED UP

122
00:03:56,335 --> 00:03:57,002
WITH OLD MELTED CHEESE,

123
00:03:57,002 --> 00:03:57,870
IT'S GOING TO SMELL ABOUT

124
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,873
THE SAME TOO.

125
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:03,342
NO THAT'S NOT GOING TO,

126
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:03,976
THIS MIGHT LOOSEN HER

127
00:04:03,976 --> 00:04:08,447
OFF A LITTLE, YEAH.

128
00:04:08,447 --> 00:04:09,248
ALL RIGHT ONCE YOU GET

129
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:11,083
THE HEATING UNIT OUT OF THERE,

130
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,151
JUST PUT IT SOMEWHERE SAFE

131
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:16,155
FOR LATER BECAUSE IN

132
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:16,922
A COUPLE OF WEEKS WE'RE

133
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:18,257
GOING TO TURN A WEED WACKER

134
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:19,225
INTO A COMBINATION HAIR

135
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:22,094
DRYER AND SIDEBURN TRIMMER.

136
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:22,695
ALL RIGHT GET BACK TO

137
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:24,130
OUR C.D. PLAYER.

138
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,764
THE INSIDE OF A C.D. PLAYER

139
00:04:25,764 --> 00:04:27,900
AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS BASICALLY

140
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,335
A LASER CONTROLLED BY

141
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,269
COMPUTER CHIPS SOLDERED

142
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:32,238
TO A CIRCUIT BOARD,

143
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,306
SO WHAT I'VE DONE IS I JUST

144
00:04:34,306 --> 00:04:35,541
CRAZY GLUED A BUNCH OF DIGITAL

145
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,777
CLOCKS TO A PIE PLATE,

146
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:39,578
AND OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING

147
00:04:39,578 --> 00:04:40,412
TO NEED SOME KIND OF A SMALL

148
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:41,547
ELECTRIC MOTOR TO WORK AS

149
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:44,850
A DRIVE TO MAKE THE C.D. SPIN.

150
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,786
NO PROBLEM WE GOT THAT COVERED.

151
00:04:47,786 --> 00:04:48,954
AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACTUAL

152
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:51,323
LASER ITSELF, NOW THESE ARE

153
00:04:51,323 --> 00:04:52,992
A USUALLY A GALLIUM ARSENIDE

154
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,693
SOLID STATE LASER BUT IF BY

155
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:55,527
CHANCE YOU DON'T HAVE ONE OF

156
00:04:55,527 --> 00:04:57,596
THOSE IN YOUR TACKLE BOX,

157
00:04:57,596 --> 00:04:58,397
I THINK YOU CAN JUST GO WITH

158
00:04:58,397 --> 00:05:01,066
A POCKET PENLIGHT BECAUSE

159
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:01,667
BASICALLY IT'S THE SAME

160
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:04,336
PROCEDURE AND I THINK

161
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:05,437
IMAGINATION BEATS INTIMIDATION

162
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:07,773
ANY DAY OF THE WEEK.

163
00:05:07,773 --> 00:05:08,607
SO ONCE YOU'VE GOT ALL

164
00:05:08,607 --> 00:05:09,908
THAT STUFF, THE IMPORTANT THING

165
00:05:09,908 --> 00:05:11,377
HERE IS TO GET THIS IN HERE,

166
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:12,878
GET IT LINED UP ABSOLUTELY

167
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:14,413
PERFECT, GET HER BALANCED

168
00:05:14,413 --> 00:05:15,981
IN THERE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT,

169
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:17,182
AND THEN TO MAKE SURE THAT

170
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:18,350
NOTHING EVER MOVES YOU

171
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,551
WANT TO MOUNT IT USING

172
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:21,186
THE HANDYMAN SECRET WEAPON,

173
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:24,490
DUCT TAPE.

174
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,824
ALL RIGHT THERE WE GO,

175
00:05:25,824 --> 00:05:26,925
AS YOU CAN SEE I PAINTED

176
00:05:26,925 --> 00:05:27,860
HER UP A LITTLE BIT,

177
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,727
GIVE HER THE FLAT BLACK

178
00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:29,728
KIND OF A SPORTY LOOK,

179
00:05:29,728 --> 00:05:30,963
AND I'VE ADDED SOME CONTROL

180
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:31,930
KNOBS HERE TO GIVE ME THE

181
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,298
CONTROL OVER THE VOLUME AND

182
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:34,933
THE TREBLE AND THE BALANCE

183
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:36,235
AND THE MELTED CHEESE,

184
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,069
WHAT I CALL

185
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:39,772
COLBY NOISE REDUCTION.

186
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,373
AND SPEAKING OF THINGS THAT ARE

187
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:44,309
OLD AND KIND OF SMELL FUNNY,

188
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:45,210
I HAVE HOOKED HER UP TO

189
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,745
MY OWN NORDMENDE THERE AS

190
00:05:46,745 --> 00:05:47,613
AN AMPLIFIER, OF COURSE THIS

191
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:48,313
HAS GOT THE TUBES IN IT AND I

192
00:05:48,313 --> 00:05:49,214
WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE TUBES,

193
00:05:49,214 --> 00:05:50,182
BUT I TOOK THEM DOWN TO THE

194
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:51,383
VARIETY STORE HERE BECAUSE

195
00:05:51,383 --> 00:05:52,317
THEY'VE GOT A TUBE TESTER

196
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:53,385
IN THERE AND I WAS TRYING

197
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:54,353
TO TEST THE DARN TUBES,

198
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,354
HAVING A HECK OF A TIME WITH

199
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:56,121
IT AND FINALLY I WENT TO

200
00:05:56,121 --> 00:05:57,055
THE GUY, I SAID HOW COME THE

201
00:05:57,055 --> 00:05:58,190
TUBE TESTER DOESN'T WORK?

202
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,258
AND HE SAYS BECAUSE IT'S

203
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,560
A BANKING MACHINE,

204
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,995
NOW THAT'S PROGRESS FOR YOU.

205
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,062
SO THEN I NEEDED SOME SPEAKERS,

206
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:05,097
WELL I DECIDED TO GO WITH

207
00:06:05,097 --> 00:06:08,801
THE HOMEMADE STYLE AND I GOT

208
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,169
THE WIRELESS HOOKUP ON THOSE,

209
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,036
I FIGURE IF I TURN HER UP

210
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:12,070
LOUD ENOUGH THE SOUND WOULD

211
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,273
GET INTO THE SPEAKERS,

212
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:15,374
AND ACTUALLY I STARTED WITH

213
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,175
PRICING THEM OUT DOWN AT

214
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:17,042
THE STEREO STORE, ONE OF THOSE

215
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:17,776
PLACES WHERE THEY GOT THE

216
00:06:17,776 --> 00:06:18,577
CARPETING ACROSS THE FLOOR

217
00:06:18,577 --> 00:06:19,511
AND UP THE WALL AND ACROSS

218
00:06:19,511 --> 00:06:20,512
THE WINDOW AND OVER THE

219
00:06:20,512 --> 00:06:21,580
GUY'S FOREHEAD AND SO FORTH,

220
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,314
AND BOY THEY GOT SPEAKERS

221
00:06:22,314 --> 00:06:23,348
IN THERE, THEY HAD ONE SPEAKER,

222
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:24,416
IT HAD TO BE 6 FEET HIGH,

223
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,918
IT LOOKED LIKE A COFFIN

224
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:26,685
AND IT WOULD OF BEEN ONCE

225
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:28,153
MY CHEQUE BOUNCED.

226
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:28,987
SO I JUST GO WITH

227
00:06:28,987 --> 00:06:29,855
THE HOMEMADE STYLE

228
00:06:29,855 --> 00:06:30,889
WE GOT HER ALL HOOKED UP,

229
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:31,924
I THINK EVERYTHING IS LOOKING

230
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:32,824
GOOD WHY DON'T WE JUST POP

231
00:06:32,824 --> 00:06:34,092
THE C.D. IN THERE AND

232
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:38,297
SEE HOW SHE GOES.

233
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:44,002

234
00:06:44,002 --> 00:06:51,510
(WHIRLING OF C.D.)

235
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,011
OH YEAH, WELL THAT'S SIDE 'A'

236
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:54,079
DONE, IF YOU REALLY LIKE MUSIC

237
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,147
YOU CAN DO THE SAME THING WITH

238
00:06:55,147 --> 00:06:56,682
A 4-SLICER AND YOUR SONGS

239
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:57,816
WILL PLAY RIGHT UP UNTIL

240
00:06:57,816 --> 00:07:00,686
WHEN THE FIRE TRUCKS ARRIVE.

241
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:01,253
NEXT WEEK WE'RE GOING TO

242
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:02,054
SHOW YOU HOW TO TURN A

243
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:03,155
WAFFLE IRON INTO A CLOSE

00:07:03,155 --> 00:07:04,957

245
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,125

246
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:07,759

247
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,460
FIND YOU HANDSOME,

248
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,161
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST

249
00:07:09,161 --> 00:07:11,463
FIND YOU HANDY.

250
00:07:11,463 --> 00:07:12,064
I WONDER WHAT RAISIN

FIND MOST DIFFICULT TO SAY,

258
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:27,145
'I DON'T KNOW'.

259
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:28,313
AND NOW HERE TO PROVE THAT

260

I WAS OVERWHELMED WITH

00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:06,218
A GREAT FEELING OF EMPTINESS.

280
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:07,219
SUDDENLY I REALIZED THAT

281
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:09,154
I HAD WASTED AN ENTIRE DECADE

282
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:10,121
OF MY LIFE ON A STUPID CAR,

MY FAMILY WERE GONE.

285

I HAD BEEN.

287
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:15,994
HOW CAN I FIND MEANING IN

288
00:08:15,994 --> 00:08:21,166
LIFE AGAIN?' SIGNED DESPONDENT.

289

>>DOUGIE: DOES HE SAY IF

290
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,737
HE WANTS TO SELL THE CAR?

291
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:27,405

00:09:48,052 --> 00:09:49,020
>>RED: YEAH, YEAH.

340
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:49,621
>>DOUGIE: ISN'T THERE

341
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:50,288
ONE ABOUT THE SABBATH?

342
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:52,957
>>RED: THERE IS.

343
00:09:52,957 --> 00:09:53,591
>>HAROLD: OH, HONOUR THY

344
00:09:53,591 --> 00:09:54,926
MOTHER AND FATHER THAT'S ONE,

345
00:09:54,926 --> 00:09:56,361
HONOUR THY MOTHER AND FATHER.

346
00:09:56,361 --> 00:09:57,095
>>RED: GOOD, GOOD, UNLESS

347
00:09:57,095 --> 00:09:58,997
THEY'RE ANYTHING LIKE MY FATHER.

348
00:09:58,997 --> 00:09:59,564
>>DOUGIE: DO UNTO OTHERS

349
00:09:59,564 --> 00:10:01,399
AS YOU HAVE THEM TO DO UNTO YOU.

350
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,467
>>HAROLD: YEAH.

351
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:03,101
>>DOUGIE: AND I THINK THAT'S

352
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:05,603
NUMBER 4, AND NUMBER 10

353
00:10:05,603 --> 00:10:06,738
IS HAVE A NICE DAY.

354
00:10:06,738 --> 00:10:09,440
>>HAROLD: YEAH,

355
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,275
THAT'S A CHEERFUL ONE,

356
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:11,809
THAT'S YOU KNOW NICE.

357
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:14,812
>>RED: YEAH, YEAH AND I BELIEVE,

358
00:10:14,812 --> 00:10:16,581
I BELIEVE NUMBER 9 IS IF YOU

359
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:18,616
LOVE SOMETHING SET IT FREE,

360
00:10:18,616 --> 00:10:19,717
IF IT COMES BACK TO YOU

361
00:10:19,717 --> 00:10:22,954
GO FOR IT.

362
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:24,188
AND NUMBER 3 IS

363
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:28,493
FINDER'S KEEPERS I BELIEVE.

>>RED: OKAY WELL I HOPE

378
00:10:44,676 --> 00:10:46,077
OUR VIEWER CAN GET SOME HELP

379
00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:47,211
OUT OF THESE GREAT WORDS

380
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:48,279
OF WISDOM.

381

>>RED: IT IS SUMMER,

385
00:10:54,552 --> 00:10:55,520
YOU HAVE LOST YOUR SON

386
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,922
AT THE AMUSEMENT PARK

387
00:10:57,922 --> 00:10:59,557
HE'S WEARING NEON ORANGE,

388
00:10:59,557 --> 00:11:01,993
LIME GREEN AND BRIGHT PURPLE

389
00:11:01,993 --> 00:11:02,627
ALLOWING HIM TO DISAPPEAR

390
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:06,597
INTO THE CROWD.

391
00:11:07,432 --> 00:11:09,767
>>REG: THIS IS BEAUTIFUL

392
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:11,969
THIS IS FIRST CLASS.

393

>>RED: A NEW TOY THERE REG?

394
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:16,174
(RIFLE SHOT FIRES)

395
00:11:16,174 --> 00:11:19,544
>>REG: OH BOY, I'M SORRY RED,

396
00:11:19,544 --> 00:11:20,445
THIS NEW TELESCOPIC LENS IS

397
00:11:20,445 --> 00:11:21,612
SO POWERFUL I COULDN'T EVEN

398
00:11:21,612 --> 00:11:23,681
SEE YOU, OH HERE TAKE A LOOK,

399
00:11:23,681 --> 00:11:26,984
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

400
00:11:26,984 --> 00:11:29,187
>>RED: A GREAT BIG EYEBALL

401
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:31,589
OH NO, THAT'S A CHIPMUNK.

402
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:32,290
YOU KNOW REG THIS MIGHT

403
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,424
BE A LITTLE BIT TOO STRONG

404
00:11:33,424 --> 00:11:34,158
FOR IT TO BE OF ANY REAL

405
00:11:34,158 --> 00:11:35,693
USE TO YOU, YOU KNOW.

406
00:11:35,693 --> 00:11:36,594
>>REG: WELL I BOUGHT IT TO

407
00:11:36,594 --> 00:11:39,363
HUNT FOR JUNIOR'S HELICOPTER,

408
00:11:39,363 --> 00:11:40,798
YOU CAN'T IGNORE TECHNOLOGY RED

409
00:11:40,798 --> 00:11:42,533
NO SIR, NOW WATCH THIS,

410
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:47,038
YOU SEE THAT ACORN ON THE

411
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:49,040
1, 2, 3, 4, 5TH BRANCH

412
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,308
ON THE TOP OF THAT OAK TREE

413
00:11:50,308 --> 00:11:52,043
OVER THERE, WATCH THIS.

414
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:54,312
(RIFLE SHOT FIRING)

415
00:11:54,312 --> 00:11:55,146
>>REG: DID I GET IT?

416
00:11:55,146 --> 00:11:56,147
PROBABLY EH?

417
00:11:56,147 --> 00:12:01,419
I BET I DID, I BET I DID,

418
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:06,023
OKAY, NOW SEE THAT ROCK?

419
00:12:11,262 --> 00:12:11,929
>>RED: WELL THE GUYS HAVE

420
00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:13,097
BEEN HAVING A LOT OF FUN WITH

421
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:14,865
JUNIOR'S USED HELICOPTER BUT

422
00:12:14,865 --> 00:12:16,567
THEY COULDN'T FIND A BIG ENOUGH

423
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:17,635
LANDING SPACE BETWEEN ANY OF

424
00:12:17,635 --> 00:12:19,537
THE TREES AROUND THE LODGE,

425
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:21,806
SO THEY GOT OUT THE BIG CHAINSAW

426
00:12:21,806 --> 00:12:22,740
LOPPED ABOUT 6 FEET OFF EACH

427
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,641
END OF THE HELICOPTER'S

428
00:12:23,641 --> 00:12:27,645
ROTOR BLADE.

429
00:12:27,645 --> 00:12:28,346
>>HAROLD: I THINK THAT WOULD

430
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:29,413
DRAMATICALLY ALTER THE FLYING

431
00:12:29,413 --> 00:12:30,448
CHARACTERISTICS WOULD

432
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:31,916
IT UNCLE RED?

433
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:32,617
I MEAN YOU KNOW ACCORDING TO

434
00:12:32,617 --> 00:12:33,884
MY LITTLE BOBBY-HOBBY BOOK

435
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:36,821
ON HOW TO BE AN ASTRONAUT,

436
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:37,521
I'M JUST SAYING THAT YOU KNOW

437
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:38,856
SUCH A MODIFICATION YOU KNOW,

438
00:12:38,856 --> 00:12:39,423
IT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY

439
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:44,161
DECREASE THE LIFT.

440
00:12:44,161 --> 00:12:44,862
>>RED: WAS THAT JUST A LUCKY

441
00:12:44,862 --> 00:12:48,666
GUESS OR DID YOU HEAR THE CRASH?

442
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:49,300
>>HAROLD: IT LANDED RIGHT

443
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,302
BESIDE MY WINDOW,

444
00:12:51,302 --> 00:12:52,036
I ALMOST GOT CIRCUMVENTED

445
00:12:52,036 --> 00:12:56,941
BY THE TAIL ROTOR.

446
00:12:56,941 --> 00:12:58,576
>>RED: THAT WOULD BE NO DAMAGE

447
00:12:58,576 --> 00:13:00,544
AT ALL I DON'T THINK.

448
00:13:00,544 --> 00:13:01,345
THEN ALL THE GUYS HAD TO FIGURE

449
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:02,413
OUT WHETHER THEY SHOULD DECREASE

450
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:03,514
THE WEIGHT OF THE UNIT OR

451
00:13:03,514 --> 00:13:04,682
INCREASE THE SPEED OF THE BLADE

452
00:13:04,682 --> 00:13:07,084
AND REGAIN THE ORIGINAL PUSH.

453
00:13:07,084 --> 00:13:07,785
>>HAROLD: THAT'S LIFT,

454
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:09,620
THAT'S VERTICAL LIFT.

455
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,354
>>RED: NO, NO, NO, NOT IN

456
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:11,288
THIS CASE, THIS IS MORE OF

457
00:13:11,288 --> 00:13:14,258
A HORIZONTAL PUSH HAROLD,

458
00:13:14,258 --> 00:13:15,760
THEY FIRED HER UP AND THE BLADE

459
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,895
WAS GOING FASTER THAN EVER

460
00:13:17,895 --> 00:13:18,796
BUT THE WHOLE HELICOPTER WAS

461
00:13:18,796 --> 00:13:19,597
DOING ACTUALLY MORE OF

462
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:22,032
A SIDEWAYS THAN AN UP,

463
00:13:22,032 --> 00:13:23,601
SO NOW THE WHOLE FOREST ON

464
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:25,369
THE EAST SIDE OF THE LODGE

465
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:28,305
IS EXACTLY 6 FEET TALL.

466
00:13:28,305 --> 00:13:29,073
>>HAROLD: WELL I GUESS WE GOT

467
00:13:29,073 --> 00:13:30,541
A LOT MORE FIREWOOD THEN HUH?

468
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:33,344
>>RED: YUP AND A VIEW.

469
00:13:33,344 --> 00:13:35,279
THE QUESTION IS WHO WANTS

470
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,280
A LAWNMOWER THAT CUTS YOUR

471
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,381
GRASS TO 6 FEET AND RUNS

472
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:41,152
ON AVIATION FUEL?

473
00:13:41,152 --> 00:13:43,387
AND THAT'S A DANGEROUS UNIT,

474
00:13:43,387 --> 00:13:46,857
I MEAN IT CAME RIGHT

475
00:13:46,857 --> 00:13:48,692
THROUGH THE BUNCH OF US,

476
00:13:48,692 --> 00:13:49,393
LUCKILY NONE OF THE GUYS

477
00:13:49,393 --> 00:13:50,461
IS OVER 6 FEET TALL,

478
00:13:50,461 --> 00:13:51,228
AT LEAST NOT ANY MORE.

479
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:52,163
>>HAROLD: YEAH I THOUGHT

480
00:13:52,163 --> 00:13:52,863
I NOTICED MOOSE THOMPSON

481
00:13:52,863 --> 00:13:54,198
HAD LOST A LITTLE HAIR.

482
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:56,233
>>RED: AND A LITTLE FOREHEAD,

483
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:57,001
BUT THEN A LONG FOREHEAD

484
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:57,768
ON MOOSE IS JUST FALSE

485
00:13:57,768 --> 00:14:01,305
ADVERTISING ANYWAY.

486
00:14:01,305 --> 00:14:02,039
SO NOW THE GUYS ARE GOING

487
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:02,973
TO MAYBE CONVERT THE THING,

488
00:14:02,973 --> 00:14:03,941
THEY'RE THINKING IT OVER,

489
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:05,109
MAYBE MAKE A HOVERCRAFT OUT

490
00:14:05,109 --> 00:14:06,076
OF HER OR A FAN BOAT OR

491
00:14:06,076 --> 00:14:10,681
PERHAPS A 4-MAN QUESENART.

492
00:14:10,681 --> 00:14:11,548

493
00:14:11,548 --> 00:14:13,050
WHEN YOU GET TOGETHER.

494

506
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,279
OUR 'ADVENTURES WITH BILL'.

507
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:43,080
BILL BROUGHT ME UP TO SHOW

508
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,250
ME WHAT WAS GOING ON.

509
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:46,950
HE HELD UP THE OLD PADDLE THERE

510
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:47,851
AND YOU CAN SEE THE BIG TEETH,

511
00:14:47,851 --> 00:14:48,786
LOOK AT THE BIG BITE MARKS

512
00:14:48,786 --> 00:14:49,653
OUT OF THAT FROM A BEAR

513
00:14:49,653 --> 00:14:50,421
OR WHAT HAVE YOU,

514
00:14:50,421 --> 00:14:51,588
ONE OF THOSE ITALIAN LOAVES HAVE

515
00:14:51,588 --> 00:14:53,757
BEEN BADLY TREATED BY SOMETHING

516
00:14:53,757 --> 00:14:55,092
VERY HUNGRY AND HE HAD A CAN OF,

517
00:14:55,092 --> 00:14:56,060
SOME KIND OF CAN OF SOMETHING

518
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,695
THAT HAD BEEN BITTEN.

519
00:14:57,695 --> 00:15:02,499
THEN HE GOT AN IDEA,

520
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:03,233
HMM, YEAH IT WASN'T AS MUCH

521
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:03,901
OF AN IDEA AS IT LOOKED

522
00:15:03,901 --> 00:15:04,601
RIGHT THERE,

523
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:05,335
THAT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE

524
00:15:05,335 --> 00:15:06,937
PORTABLE LAMP THAT HE BRINGS

525
00:15:06,937 --> 00:15:07,971
TO ALL HIS CAMPSITES

526
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:10,441
IN CASE THERE IS HYDRO.

527
00:15:10,441 --> 00:15:11,542
ANYWAY HE'S GOT SOME WASHERS

528
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:13,210
THERE, NOW WHAT'S GOING ON

529
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,078
HERE NOW, SO YOU DROP THE

530
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:16,713
WASHERS INTO SOME TIN CANS,

531
00:15:16,713 --> 00:15:17,381
I THINK WHAT HE'S TRYING TO

532
00:15:17,381 --> 00:15:18,315
DO IS MAKE SOME KIND OF

533
00:15:18,315 --> 00:15:21,485
A NOISEMAKER TYPE OF DEAL.

534
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:24,521
HMM, THAT'S KIND OF ODD.

535
00:15:24,521 --> 00:15:27,291
(SPLAT OF BIRD DROPPINGS)

536
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,659
OH THAT'S WHY THAT HAPPENED,

537
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:29,526
ALL RIGHT NOW HE STRINGS

538
00:15:29,526 --> 00:15:30,928
ALL THE CANS WITH THE WASHERS

539
00:15:30,928 --> 00:15:31,695
ON THEM YOU SEE AND YOU STRING

540
00:15:31,695 --> 00:15:32,529
IT ACROSS LIKE A...

541
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:34,798
I GUESS IT'S LIKE A TRIPWIRE,

542
00:15:34,798 --> 00:15:35,499
AND HE GETS AROUND THE TREE

543
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:38,969
TO THAT AND PULLED HER TIGHT,

544
00:15:38,969 --> 00:15:39,803
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD USE

545
00:15:39,803 --> 00:15:40,938
A JERKING MOTION WITH THOSE,

546
00:15:40,938 --> 00:15:41,772
I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST TIGHTEN

547
00:15:41,772 --> 00:15:42,539
THAT GRADUALLY BILL,

548
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:44,107
DON'T, DON'T, BILL, BILL, BILL,

549
00:15:44,107 --> 00:15:46,076
OH! OH! OH NOW THE WASHERS ARE

550
00:15:46,076 --> 00:15:47,344
KIND OF LIKE A, ALMOST LIKE

551
00:15:47,344 --> 00:15:49,713
A BULLET AT THIS POINT.

552
00:15:49,713 --> 00:15:52,649
YEAH HE'S FINE, YEAH, YEAH,

553
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:53,817
NO, OH, OH, OH, OH THE

554
00:15:53,817 --> 00:15:56,119
END OF ANOTHER GOOD IDEA.

555
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:57,054
ANYWAY WE PUT THE WASHERS

556
00:15:57,054 --> 00:15:59,223
BACK IN, SEE HOW THAT WORKS,

557
00:15:59,223 --> 00:15:59,990
ANY KIND OF AN ANIMAL WILL HEAR

558
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,158
THAT AND THEN HE HAD ANOTHER

559
00:16:01,158 --> 00:16:02,125
RIG THERE WITH A LITTLE BUNCH

560
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,294
OF CURVE FEELERS OFF THE OLD,

561
00:16:04,294 --> 00:16:04,861
(BELLS RINGING)

562
00:16:04,861 --> 00:16:05,596
OH NO THIS IS THE JINGLE BELL

563
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:06,663
ONE FIRST, YEAH, I LOVE THAT,

564
00:16:06,663 --> 00:16:07,731
IT'S LIKE, IT SOUNDS LIKE

565
00:16:07,731 --> 00:16:11,201
SANTA'S COMING TO TOWN HUH?

566
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:12,703
THESE ARE THE CURB FEELERS

567
00:16:12,703 --> 00:16:16,373
OFF THE OLD STUDEBAKER,

568
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:17,608
ISN'T THAT NICE?

569
00:16:17,608 --> 00:16:18,342
OR MAYBE THOSE ARE THE

570
00:16:18,342 --> 00:16:19,843
SPARKLER THINGS, I'M NOT SURE.

571
00:16:19,843 --> 00:16:21,478
ANYWAY THE SAME IDEA,

572
00:16:21,478 --> 00:16:22,346
THE ANIMAL TRIPS OVER THAT AND

573
00:16:22,346 --> 00:16:24,047
SO NOW BILL CAN JUST GET BACK

574
00:16:24,047 --> 00:16:27,050
INTO THE TENT AND LIE DOWN

575
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:27,951
AND HE'S JUST GOING TO READ,

576
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:28,518
YOU KNOW HE'S GOING TO

577
00:16:28,518 --> 00:16:29,486
TAKE HIS PADDLE,

578
00:16:29,486 --> 00:16:30,187
HE LIKES TO CUDDLE UP WITH

579
00:16:30,187 --> 00:16:31,355
A PADDLE EVER SINCE THAT

580
00:16:31,355 --> 00:16:33,790
CANOEING ACCIDENT AND HE

581
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,525
JUST PRETENDS HE'S ASLEEP,

582
00:16:35,525 --> 00:16:38,061
(LOUD SNORING)

583
00:16:38,061 --> 00:16:41,298
JUST PRETENDS HE'S ASLEEP!

584
00:16:41,298 --> 00:16:42,065
BILL, HE'S A GOOD ACTOR,

585
00:16:42,065 --> 00:16:42,799
WELL IF HE CAN PRETEND

586
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:43,600
HE'S ASLEEP, I'LL PRETEND

587
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,470
I'M AN ANIMAL.

588
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,037

'GONE WITH THE WIND'

4 HOURS, YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW,

ON THEIR HANDS WHEN THIS MOVIE

630

00:18:15,492 --> 00:18:17,494
IF I HAD A MUSTACHE.

644

>>RED: HAROLD IF YOU HAD

645
00:18:19,195 --> 00:18:21,031

00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:21,665
LIKE YOUR MOTHER.

647
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:26,536

00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:32,175
>>RED: I KNOW A LOT OF YOU

651
00:18:32,175 --> 00:18:33,009
TEENAGERS GO TO THE MOVIES

652
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:34,711
BECAUSE I'M THE GUY THAT SITS

653
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:37,414
BEHIND YOU AND TELLS YOU TO

654
00:18:37,414 --> 00:18:38,882
SHUT UP AND REMINDS YOU THAT

655
00:18:38,882 --> 00:18:39,783
THAT GIRL YOU'RE WITH IS THE

656
00:18:39,783 --> 00:18:40,583
DAUGHTER OF A FRIEND OF MINE.

657
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:41,518
SO I KNOW THAT YOU'RE GETTING

658
00:18:41,518 --> 00:18:42,919
EXPOSED TO A LOT OF VIOLENCE

659
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:43,887
ESPECIALLY IF YOU KEEP RATTLING

660
00:18:43,887 --> 00:18:46,723
THAT CELLOPHANE BAG OF JUJUBES.

661
00:18:46,723 --> 00:18:47,657
BUT THE MOVIES TODAY,

662
00:18:47,657 --> 00:18:49,259
OH MY GOD, IT SEEMS LIKE

663
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:50,460
SOMEBODY'S ALWAYS GETTING THEIR

664
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,062
HEAD BLOWN OFF OR YOU GET

665
00:18:52,062 --> 00:18:53,163
THE SLICE AND DICE,

666
00:18:53,163 --> 00:18:54,064
OR YOU GOT RAMBO TURNING

667
00:18:54,064 --> 00:18:56,332
EVERYBODY INTO SPAMBO.

668
00:18:56,332 --> 00:18:57,267
I WOULDN'T DO TO FISH WHAT

669
00:18:57,267 --> 00:18:58,168
THE PEOPLE DO TO EACH OTHER

670
00:18:58,168 --> 00:18:59,803
IN SOME OF THESE MOVIES.

671
00:18:59,803 --> 00:19:00,637
AND I'M CONCERNED THAT THE

672
00:19:00,637 --> 00:19:01,571
YOUNGSTERS START ACCEPTING

673
00:19:01,571 --> 00:19:02,906
THAT LEVEL OF VIOLENCE

674
00:19:02,906 --> 00:19:03,773
AS PART OF THEIR NORMAL

675
00:19:03,773 --> 00:19:05,175
DAILY LIVES, THIS COULD BE

676
00:19:05,175 --> 00:19:08,711
BAD NEWS FOR CROSSING GUARDS.

677
00:19:08,711 --> 00:19:09,679
SO I'M ASKING YOU, YOU TEENAGERS

678
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,381
PARTICULARLY TO JUST PUT THE

679
00:19:11,381 --> 00:19:12,715
VIOLENCE ON THE BACK BURNER,

680
00:19:12,715 --> 00:19:13,950
START CONCENTRATING ON SEX

681
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:14,751
THAT'S WHERE YOU SHOULD

682
00:19:14,751 --> 00:19:15,685
TURN YOUR MIND BECAUSE THE

683
00:19:15,685 --> 00:19:16,753
LIBIDO WILL ONLY LAST A CERTAIN

684
00:19:16,753 --> 00:19:18,354
LENGTH OF TIME WHEREAS THE URGE

685
00:19:18,354 --> 00:19:19,455
TO SMACK SOMEBODY IN THE

686
00:19:19,455 --> 00:19:20,290
MELON GOES RIGHT TO

687
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:24,160
THE GRAVE AND BEYOND.

688
00:19:25,094 --> 00:19:25,995
>>RED: I HEARD THAT

689
00:19:25,995 --> 00:19:27,030
JUNIOR SINGLETON WAS FOOLING

690
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:27,964
AROUND WITH HIS HELICOPTER

691
00:19:27,964 --> 00:19:29,065
DOWN BY THE DOCK, SO I WENT

692
00:19:29,065 --> 00:19:31,000
DOWN TO SEE HAP SHAUGHNESSY

693
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,768
AND SEE IF HE'D SEEN HIM

694
00:19:31,768 --> 00:19:32,535
AND HAD ANY IDEA WHAT

695
00:19:32,535 --> 00:19:34,671
WAS GOING ON?

696
00:19:34,671 --> 00:19:35,838
HAVE YOU SEEN JUNIOR SINGLETON?

697
00:19:35,838 --> 00:19:36,539
I HEARD HE WAS DOWN AT

698
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:37,540
THE DOCK HERE.

699
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,274
>>HAP: HE'S PROBABLY DOWN AT

700
00:19:38,274 --> 00:19:39,576
THE BOAT HOUSE DOCK RED,

701
00:19:39,576 --> 00:19:40,243
CLIMB ON, I'LL GIVE

702
00:19:40,243 --> 00:19:41,945
YOU A RIDE OVER.

703
00:19:41,945 --> 00:19:42,979
>>RED: WELL I DON'T WANT

704
00:19:42,979 --> 00:19:44,480
TO CAUSE ANY INCONVENIENCE.

705
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,515
>>HAP: NO INCONVENIENCE

706
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:47,684
TO ME RED.

707
00:19:47,684 --> 00:19:51,955
>>RED: YEAH I KNOW.

708
00:19:51,955 --> 00:19:53,022
>>HAP: WHAT'S JUNIOR SINGLETON

709
00:19:53,022 --> 00:19:53,756
DOING DOWN AT THE BOAT

710
00:19:53,756 --> 00:19:55,325
HOUSE DOCK?

711
00:19:55,325 --> 00:19:56,025
>>RED: I DON'T REALLY KNOW

712
00:19:56,025 --> 00:19:57,293
BUT IT INVOLVES WHATEVER IS

713
00:19:57,293 --> 00:19:59,862
LEFT OF HIS HELICOPTER.

714
00:19:59,862 --> 00:20:01,564
>>HAP: HE WAS ASKING FOR

715
00:20:01,564 --> 00:20:03,766
TROUBLE FLYING WITHOUT A LICENCE

716
00:20:03,766 --> 00:20:06,235
WHY DIDN'T HE ASK ME,

717
00:20:06,235 --> 00:20:07,870
I NEVER CRASHED ONCE IN VIETNAM

718
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:11,407
OR KOREA OR OPERATION DESERT

719
00:20:11,407 --> 00:20:15,144
SONG, THE FALKLANDS OR TOLEDO,

720
00:20:15,144 --> 00:20:15,778
I WAS A HELICOPTER

721
00:20:15,778 --> 00:20:17,480
TRAFFIC REPORTER.

722
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,314
>>RED: IN TOLEDO?

723
00:20:18,314 --> 00:20:20,083
>>HAP: NO, VIETNAM.

724
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,217
IN TOLEDO I WAS LONI ANDERSON'S

725
00:20:21,217 --> 00:20:23,086
PRIVATE PILOT BUT I NEVER,

726
00:20:23,086 --> 00:20:25,822
EVER CRASHED A HELICOPTER.

727
00:20:25,822 --> 00:20:27,523
>>RED: NO ME EITHER.

728
00:20:27,523 --> 00:20:28,224
>>HAP: YOU DON'T

729
00:20:28,224 --> 00:20:30,193
FLY HELICOPTERS.

730
00:20:30,193 --> 00:20:32,495
>>RED: YEAH ME EITHER.

731
00:20:32,495 --> 00:20:33,529
>>HAP: NOW HANG ON,

732
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:34,297
I KNOW EVERYTHING THERE IS

733
00:20:34,297 --> 00:20:35,098
TO KNOW ABOUT HELICOPTERS.

734
00:20:35,098 --> 00:20:35,965
THE LAST TIME I WAS IN THE ANDES

735
00:20:35,965 --> 00:20:36,899
THIS PLANE CRASHED INTO

736
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:38,868
A MOUNTAIN PASS,

737
00:20:38,868 --> 00:20:39,669
THE ONLY WAY TO RESCUE THE

738
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:41,237
SURVIVORS WAS BY HELICOPTER

739
00:20:41,237 --> 00:20:42,271
BUT THE BIG CHOPPERS COULDN'T

740
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:45,541
HOVER IN THE THIN MOUNTAIN AIR.

741
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:46,542
SO I ELIMINATED EVERYTHING BUT

742
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:47,777
THE ENGINE AND THE THROTTLE,

743
00:20:47,777 --> 00:20:49,045
AND GRIPPING TIGHTLY ONTO

744
00:20:49,045 --> 00:20:50,413
THE EXHAUST I FLEW UP THERE

745
00:20:50,413 --> 00:20:51,581
AND I GOT THOSE PEOPLE,

746
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:52,348
WELL THEY MADE A BOOK

747
00:20:52,348 --> 00:20:53,249
AND A MOVIE ABOUT IT.

748
00:20:53,249 --> 00:20:54,217
>>RED: OH YEAH,

749
00:20:54,217 --> 00:20:57,920
THE GREAT IMPOSTER.

750
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,857
>>HAP: NO THIS WAS CALLED A LIE,

751
00:21:00,857 --> 00:21:02,992
HARRISON FORD PLAYED MY PART

752
00:21:02,992 --> 00:21:03,860
BUT HE WAS CUT OUT

753
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,927
OF THE FINAL VERSION.

754
00:21:04,927 --> 00:21:05,628
IT'S TOO BAD TOO,

755
00:21:05,628 --> 00:21:06,963
HE GAVE A VERY CONVINCING AND

756
00:21:06,963 --> 00:21:09,499
A VERY BELIEVABLE PERFORMANCE.

757
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:10,166
>>RED: OH, SO HE CHANGED

758
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,535
THE CHARACTER COMPLETELY.

759
00:21:17,507 --> 00:21:18,107
>>RED: WELL THIS USED

760
00:21:18,107 --> 00:21:18,841
HELICOPTER HAS TURNED

761
00:21:18,841 --> 00:21:20,543
INTO A REAL CHALLENGE,

762
00:21:20,543 --> 00:21:22,144
I SUGGESTED JUNIOR RETURN IT

763
00:21:22,144 --> 00:21:22,979
AND AT LEAST GET SOME OF

764
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:24,780
HIS MONEY BACK, BUT HE SAID

765
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,681
THAT HIS WIFE ALREADY FOUND OUT

766
00:21:25,681 --> 00:21:26,782
THAT HE BOUGHT IT SO THERE'S

767
00:21:26,782 --> 00:21:27,650
REALLY NO SAFE WAY OUT

768
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,953
OF THIS AT THIS POINT.

769
00:21:30,953 --> 00:21:32,288
>>HAROLD: YOU KNOW IF PEOPLE

770
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,689
THOUGHT THESE THINGS THROUGH

771
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:34,724
MAYBE WE WOULDN'T HAVE

772
00:21:34,724 --> 00:21:35,558
THESE KINDS OF PROBLEMS.

773
00:21:35,558 --> 00:21:36,325
>>RED: HOW MANY TIMES HAVE

774
00:21:36,325 --> 00:21:37,126
I WISHED THAT YOUR PARENTS HAD

775
00:21:37,126 --> 00:21:41,063
THOUGHT THINGS THROUGH HAROLD.

776
00:21:41,063 --> 00:21:42,164
BUT WE MAKE THE BEST OF IT

777
00:21:42,164 --> 00:21:43,032
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT JUNIOR

778
00:21:43,032 --> 00:21:45,167
HAS DONE, HE TOOK THE MOTOR

779
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:46,569
AND THE BLADE OFF THE HELICOPTER

780
00:21:46,569 --> 00:21:47,837
AND HE MOUNTED THEM SIDEWAYS

781
00:21:47,837 --> 00:21:48,904
ON THE BOAT HOUSE LIKE

782
00:21:48,904 --> 00:21:51,674
A HUGE NUCLEAR FAN,

783
00:21:51,674 --> 00:21:52,475
AND THEN HE TOOK WHAT WAS LEFT

784
00:21:52,475 --> 00:21:53,643
OF THE HELICOPTER, ADDED A

785
00:21:53,643 --> 00:21:54,443
COUPLE OF CANOES TO IT AND

786
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:56,979
MADE HIMSELF A GLIDER.

787
00:21:56,979 --> 00:21:57,947
>>HAROLD: WOW!

788
00:21:57,947 --> 00:21:58,848
SO HOW DOES THIS WORK LIKE NOW?

789
00:21:58,848 --> 00:21:59,815
DOES THE NUCLEAR FAN JUST KIND

790
00:21:59,815 --> 00:22:01,617
OF BLOW THE GLIDER AWAY?

791
00:22:01,617 --> 00:22:02,818
>>RED: NO, BUSTER HADFIELD

792
00:22:02,818 --> 00:22:03,986
TIED A ROPE TO THE GLIDER

793
00:22:03,986 --> 00:22:05,788
AND ANCHORED IT TO THE DOCK,

794
00:22:05,788 --> 00:22:07,323
SO JUNIOR KIND OF FLOATS OVER

795
00:22:07,323 --> 00:22:09,892
THE LAKE JUST LIKE THAT,

796
00:22:09,892 --> 00:22:10,960
HE CAN FLY IN A STRAIGHT LINE

797
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,194
FOR 5 OR 6 HOURS AND NEVER

798
00:22:12,194 --> 00:22:13,229
BE MORE THAN 89 FEET

799
00:22:13,229 --> 00:22:16,132
FROM THE LODGE.

800
00:22:16,132 --> 00:22:17,266
AND HE DOESN'T NEED A LICENCE

801
00:22:17,266 --> 00:22:18,267
BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY

802
00:22:18,267 --> 00:22:19,502
AN AIRPLANE, IT'S CLASSIFIED

803
00:22:19,502 --> 00:22:21,871
AS A MANNED KITE,

804
00:22:21,871 --> 00:22:25,608
OR MAYBE A MANNED

805
00:22:25,608 --> 00:22:29,812
LIGHTNING ROD, WE'LL SEE.

806
00:22:29,812 --> 00:22:30,746
>>HAROLD: WHATEVER IT IS

807
00:22:30,746 --> 00:22:31,680
IT SOUNDS COOL!

808
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,817
I'D LOVE TO TRY THAT,

809
00:22:34,817 --> 00:22:37,219
DO YOU THINK I COULD

810
00:22:37,219 --> 00:22:37,820
TRUST YOU GUYS NOT

811
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,821
TO CUT THE ROPE?

812
00:22:38,821 --> 00:22:40,890
>>RED: NOT A CHANCE HAROLD.

813
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,158
(POSSUM SQUEALING)

814
00:22:42,158 --> 00:22:43,058
>>HAROLD: OH IT'S MEETING TIME,

815
00:22:43,058 --> 00:22:43,859
I'M GOING TO GO DOWN TO THE

816
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:44,593
MEETING AND I'M GOING TO GET

817
00:22:44,593 --> 00:22:45,461
THOSE GUYS TO SWEAR THEY'RE

818
00:22:45,461 --> 00:22:47,897
NOT GOING TO CUT THE ROPE.

819
00:22:47,897 --> 00:22:48,731
>>RED: WELL YOU USUALLY GET

820
00:22:48,731 --> 00:22:49,799
THE GUYS TO SWEAR HAROLD

821
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:53,102
BUT IT GENERALLY LACKS FOCUS.

822
00:22:53,102 --> 00:22:53,903
GO GIVE IT A TRY AND I'LL

823
00:22:53,903 --> 00:22:54,570
BE DOWN IN A MINUTE

824
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,204
ALL RIGHT.

825
00:22:55,204 --> 00:22:56,939
>>HAROLD: OKAY, YEAH.

826
00:22:56,939 --> 00:22:57,673
>>RED: WELL I GUESS THE

827
00:22:57,673 --> 00:22:58,607
HELICOPTER THING WASN'T

828
00:22:58,607 --> 00:23:00,042
A TOTAL DISASTER,

829
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:00,709
I MEAN JUNIOR GOT A NEW TOY

830
00:23:00,709 --> 00:23:01,844
OUT OF IT AND NOW WE'RE

831
00:23:01,844 --> 00:23:02,945
GUARANTEED A BREEZE ON

832
00:23:02,945 --> 00:23:04,346
POSSUM LAKE EVEN IF IT DROWNS

833
00:23:04,346 --> 00:23:05,648
OUT ALL CONVERSATION AND

834
00:23:05,648 --> 00:23:09,585
SHREDS THE OCCASIONAL DUCK.

835
00:23:09,585 --> 00:23:10,419
ANYWAY IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING

836
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:11,253
I HOPE YOU NOTICED WHAT

837
00:23:11,253 --> 00:23:12,188
HAPPENED HERE TONIGHT,

838
