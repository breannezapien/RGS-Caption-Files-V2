[ CRASH ]

165
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:26,978
You know, there are two things
every man finds hard to do.

166
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:29,114
Number one is parallel park.

167
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:33,418
Number two is explain to your
wife why you watch this show.

168
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:35,787
Now, I can only deal with
one problem at a time

169
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:38,957
so I'm going to focus
on the parallel parking.

170
00:07:38,957 --> 00:07:40,625
The problem is pretty simple.

171
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,127
You need the car
to move sideways

172
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:44,229
but the wheels
don't point that way.

173
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:46,665
What if you add
a set of wheels?

174
00:07:46,665 --> 00:07:49,935
Smaller wheels?

175
00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:52,871
These are brand
new caster wheels.

176
00:07:52,871 --> 00:07:54,406
They're too pricey for me

177
00:07:54,406 --> 00:07:56,508
so Dalton just
loaned me a bunch.

178
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:59,744
Or, at least, I'm sure
he would've if he was home.

179
00:07:59,744 --> 00:08:01,713
Now I'm going to
mount those casters

180
00:08:01,713 --> 00:08:04,483
on this heavy-duty
piece of marine plywood.

181
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:05,984
Okay, I'm not good with metric.

182
00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:07,152
This is one-inch ply

183
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:08,954
but if you were buying it
from a Canadian lumber store,

184
00:08:08,954 --> 00:08:10,722
you got to switch
over to celsius

185
00:08:10,722 --> 00:08:14,426
which I believe is
nine deca-heca-liter.

186
00:08:14,426 --> 00:08:16,728
Okay, this first
thing you want to do

187
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:18,997
is you got to cut this thing
so it's the same length

188
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:22,601
as the distance between
the front and back wheels.

189
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:28,206
For once in my life,
everything's working
out perfect.

190
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:32,978
Okay, I got the board
mounted on there

191
00:08:32,978 --> 00:08:35,046
with a jack in each corner.

192
00:08:35,046 --> 00:08:37,682
Got the casters underneath
pointing sideways.

193
00:08:37,682 --> 00:08:39,551
This looks like
a winner to me.

194
00:08:39,551 --> 00:08:41,853
How can you lose
with four jacks?

195
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:44,322
The jacks are activated
by what were cordless drills

196
00:08:44,322 --> 00:08:46,925
but I've got them running
off the cigarette lighter.

197
00:08:46,925 --> 00:08:49,494
They're nine-volt drills
and the car is 12-volt

198
00:08:49,494 --> 00:08:52,597
so that should save
me a lot of time.

199
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:55,333
And the beauty of DC is that
you can reverse the drills

200
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,402
by just switching the wires.

201
00:08:57,402 --> 00:09:00,138
So I got one cigarette lighter
for lowering the unit

202
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:03,141
and I got another
one for raising it.

203
00:09:03,141 --> 00:09:05,477
I'm done with
parallel parking.

204
00:09:05,477 --> 00:09:10,682

as far as I'm concerned.

319
00:14:53,123 --> 00:14:57,161
So we get the possum van
hooked up to the boat trailer

320
00:14:57,161 --> 00:15:02,733
and attached her real good

321
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:06,003
is that the trees had kind of
grown up around the boat

322
00:15:06,003 --> 00:15:07,771
there was no way I could get it
cleared out of there, so...

323
00:15:07,771 --> 00:15:10,908
There was no way of
getting the boat out

324
00:15:10,908 --> 00:15:12,376
unless we knock
some of those --

325
00:15:12,376 --> 00:15:13,911
Do we need to take
some of those trees down?

326
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:14,878
That's the only way --

327
00:15:14,878 --> 00:15:16,146
Bill's got an idea.

328
00:15:16,146 --> 00:15:17,481
He's got an axe.

329
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:22,986
Oh... okay.

330
00:15:22,986 --> 00:15:26,089
That's not really what
I had in mind, Bill.

331
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:28,859
I noticed that the head
is now missing on his axe

332
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:30,661
and we're looking
around for that.

333
00:15:30,661 --> 00:15:32,496
Can't figure out
quite where that went.

334
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:33,864
So I got a hole
in my boat now

335
00:15:33,864 --> 00:15:36,233
and there's only one thing
worse than a hole in your boat

336
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:39,436
and that would be two
holes in your boat.

337
00:15:39,436 --> 00:15:40,737
Now where's the
head of the axe?

338
00:15:40,737 --> 00:15:42,906
There it is,
yeah, okay.

339
00:15:42,906 --> 00:15:44,474
All right, so, yeah.

340
00:15:44,474 --> 00:15:47,611
Luckily Bill gets back
working on the boat.

341
00:15:47,611 --> 00:15:51,415
You know, I'll tell
you one thing,

342
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:53,217
the trees are safe.

343
00:15:53,217 --> 00:15:54,585
I take the --

344
00:15:54,585 --> 00:15:55,886
Okay, let's
get the axe --

345
00:15:55,886 --> 00:15:57,721
Now let's try something
a little safer than that.

346
00:15:57,721 --> 00:15:58,922
All right, this is --

347
00:15:58,922 --> 00:16:04,962
Same problem.

348
00:16:04,962 --> 00:16:07,130
All right, think of
something else, Bill.

349
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,732
Must be something else.

350
00:16:08,732 --> 00:16:09,900
Bill?

351
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,068
Okay, got an idea.

352
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:13,804
Okay, now do not ever fill
your chainsaw up like --

353
00:16:13,804 --> 00:16:16,607
I'm thinking to myself,
this is going to be interesting.

354
00:16:16,607 --> 00:16:18,809

No, no, no, no.

357
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:27,150
So he gets her going and I
think he had the mix off
on the oil and gas

358
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,119
cause she was
smoking real good.

359
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:30,454
It got the point like I
couldn't see what he was doing.

360
00:16:30,454 --> 00:16:33,123
That didn't matter.

361
00:16:33,123 --> 00:16:35,926
The big problem was he couldn't
see what he was doing

362
00:16:35,926 --> 00:16:37,661
but the trees
were coming down.

363
00:16:37,661 --> 00:16:39,363
So I thought okay,
benefit of the doubt,

364
00:16:39,363 --> 00:16:42,265
we'll get the boat out
but I'm not sure it was

technically even a boat
any more at this point.

Okay, Bill, now what?

Well good ol' Bill always
has another plan.

368
00:16:53,276 --> 00:16:56,046
So he starts pulling
the logs together

369
00:16:56,046 --> 00:16:58,148
and I realize
what he's up to.

370
00:16:58,148 --> 00:16:59,583
Down to the boat ramp.

371
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:02,219
We got the outboard mounted
on the back of a log ramp

with the boat windshield
and the canoe front.

Remember when you used to
have these electric blankets

00:17:19,503 --> 00:17:21,071
with the dual controls

376
00:17:21,071 --> 00:17:24,207
so your wife could simmer
on her own side of the bed.

377
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:25,709
Then, once the
hot flashes started,

378
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:29,246
you replaced this baby with
a 40-horsepower ceiling fan.

Well today, we're going
to turn this unit into
something useful.

Okay, first you want to cut --

No, first... unplug it.

382

Second, cut the one side
into strips about a foot wide.

383
00:17:46,096 --> 00:17:48,899
Now you're probably
going to snip through
a few wires as you go

384
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:50,233
but just reconnect them later

with the handyman's
secret solder.

386

Okay now you just attach
those strips to the edge

of the other half
of the blanket

388

because on the outside edge
I've got her set on warm

00:21:13,302 --> 00:21:15,404
Sit down.

480
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:17,807
Bow your heads for
the man's prayer.

481
00:21:17,807 --> 00:21:19,108
I'm a man

482
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:20,176
but I can change

483
00:21:20,176 --> 00:21:21,410
if I have to

484
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:24,213
I guess.

485
00:21:24,213 --> 00:21:26,249
Okay men, we had a bit
of a labelling mix up

486
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:28,818
on the musk that
you've been using.

487
00:21:28,818 --> 00:21:30,686
So, we need you
to stop spreading that

488
00:21:30,686 --> 00:21:32,622
over all the trees
and bushes and everything

489
00:21:32,622 --> 00:21:48,638
'cause the whole forest
