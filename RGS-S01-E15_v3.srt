00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,944
MAN WHO MAKES THIS ALL POSSIBLE,

7
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:45,979
AND THAT INCLUDES SIGNING THE

8
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,280
PAYCHECKS, BUT NOT GOING AS FAR

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,815
TO GET T SHIRTS PRINTED UP OR

10
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:49,716
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

11
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,450
OH, NO.

12
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,584
ANYWAY, HERE HE IS, THE STAR OF

13
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:54,153
THE SHOW AND MY UNCLE, WHICH IS

14
00:00:54,153 --> 00:00:55,989
TO SAY MY FATHER'S BROTHER, AND

15
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:56,956
THAT PART'S TRUE.

16
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:58,091
I SHOULD PROBABLY SAY THAT.

17
00:00:58,091 --> 00:00:59,025
IT'S VERY MUCH SO TRUE.

18
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:00,226
HERE HE IS, THE STAR OF THE

19
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,195
SHOW, MR. RED GREEN.

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,602
>> HELLO, AND THANK YOU ALL FOR

21
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:11,771
TUNING IN WHEN, YOU KNOW, THERE

22
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,039
ARE SO MANY WORTHWHILE THINGS

23
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,007
YOU COULD BE DOING WITH YOUR

24
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,108
LIFE.

25
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:15,975
YOU KNOW, NOT EVERYBODY CAN SAY

26
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:16,676
THAT.

27
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:17,410
HAROLD, COME ON OVER HERE A

28
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,678
MINUTE.

29
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:19,846
HAROLD IS THE ANNOUNCER,

30
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:22,081
PRODUCER, DIRECTOR, AND STAR'S

31
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:23,182
NEPHEW OF THE SHOW HERE.

33
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,219
CONTROL ALL THE VISUAL EFFECTS.

00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:26,953
WATCH THIS.

35
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:30,223
[laughs]

36
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,125
>> NOW, AREN'T KIDS SOMETHING?

37
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,294
I DON'T HAVE ANY MYSELF.

38
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:35,295
I ACTUALLY WENT UP TO THE LODGE

39
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,796
YESTERDAY.

40
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:38,097
BUSTER HATFIELD GOT ALL THE GUYS

41
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,699
TO TAKE OFF THEIR SOCKS AND

42
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:40,900
SHOES AND HAVE A GAME OF LAWN

43
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,235
DARTS.

44
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,070
YEAH, HE LOVES CONTACT SPORTS.

45
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,773
BUT YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN ALL KIND

46
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,175
OF SAFETY-CONSCIOUS SINCE WE HAD

47
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:50,209
THAT METHANE EXPLOSION WHEN

48
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:51,511
STINKY PETERSON DROPPED A

49
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,846
CIGARETTE DOWN THE TWO-HOLER.

50
00:01:53,846 --> 00:01:55,214
OH, GOD, THAT SCARED A BUNCH OF

51
00:01:55,214 --> 00:01:56,482
US, ESPECIALLY STINKY.

52
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:58,084
LUCKILY, HE WAS SITTIN' DOWN.

53
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:59,819
BUT YOU KNOW, BUSTER LOVES

54
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:00,486
DANGER.

55
00:02:00,486 --> 00:02:01,387
I'D SAY DANGER IS HIS MIDDLE

56
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:02,121
NAME.

57
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:03,556
IT'S UKRAINIAN OR SOMETHING.

58
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:04,357
>> WOW, THAT'S A GREAT STORY,

59
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:05,825
UNCLE RED, BUT LET'S MOVE ON TO

60
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:06,626
THE NEXT SEGMENT.

61
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,527
[laughs]

62
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:08,327
>> WELL, I'M NOT FINISHED THE

63
00:02:08,327 --> 00:02:09,128
STORY, HAROLD.

64
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:09,896
>> OH, NO>

65
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,030
WELL, THAT'S--THAT'S A EXCELLENT

66
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,165
POINT, BUT MAYBE JUST DON'T GIVE

67
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,699
IT ALL TO THE VIEWERS RIGHT NOW.

68
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:14,867
HOLD SOME BACK, YOU KNOW?

69
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:16,102
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYIN'.

70
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:17,770
>> WELL, YOU'RE THE PRODUCER.

71
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,504
>> YEAH, AND WHILE THEY'RE

72
00:02:18,504 --> 00:02:19,472
AWAITING THE CONCLUSION OF YOUR

73
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,740
STORY, WE'LL SHOW THEM SOMETHING

74
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,976
THAT'S NOT, LIKE, SO BORING.

75
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:25,945
STAND BACK.

76
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,748
>> YOU KNOW, HAROLD, YOU'RE

77
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:29,615
GONNA HURT YOURSELF ON THAT

78
00:02:29,615 --> 00:02:30,483
THING ONE DAY.

79
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,918
>> YOU REALLY THINK SO?

80
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,886
>> I'M GONNA MAKE SURE OF IT.

81
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:40,226
>> [strumming guitar] THERE ONCE WAS A GIRL

82
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:42,228
IN MY HIGH SCHOOL

83
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:46,332
THE PRETTIEST GIRL IN CLASS

84
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,967
SHE HAD THE NICEST

85
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,936
AUBURN HAIR

86
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,003
BUT THERE'S NO WAY

87
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:53,940
THAT THIS LINE'S GONNA RHYME

88
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,541
I WANTED SO BAD

89
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,343
TO TAKE HER OUT

90
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,045
I THOUGHT MY HEART

91
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,247
WOULD BURST

92
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,382
BUT ONCE I SAW

93
00:03:03,382 --> 00:03:04,917
HER FATHER'S BICEPS

94
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:05,818
I WAS AFRAID

95
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,787
HE'D TAKE ME OUT FIRST

96
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,228
>> THIS WEEK IN THE HANDYMAN

97
00:03:16,228 --> 00:03:18,497
CORNER, WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT

98
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:20,366
SOMETHING UNPLEASANT BUT

99
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,134
NECESSARY, AND I DON'T MEAN

100
00:03:22,134 --> 00:03:24,670
KISSIN' YOUR GRANDMOTHER.

101
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,738
IF YOU'RE LIKE ME, AND YOU OWN A

102
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,273
FULL SET OF POWER TOOLS, YOU

103
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:28,808
PROBABLY THINK ABOUT DEATH A

104
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,376
LOT.

105
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,410
AND YOU KNOW THEM FUNERAL

106
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,545
PARLORS CAN JUST CHARGE WHATEVER

107
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,512
THEY WANT.

108
00:03:33,512 --> 00:03:34,313
YEAH, I MEAN, THEY CALL THEIR

109
00:03:34,313 --> 00:03:36,182
CUSTOMERS "STIFFS."

110
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,249
THE COFFIN ALONE'S GONNA COST

111
00:03:37,249 --> 00:03:38,551
YOU $2,000 OR $3,000,

112
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,353
OR WHAT YOU CAN DO IS PICK UP

113
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,954
A BROKEN FREEZER CHEAP

114
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:44,623
AND MAKE YOUR OWN.

115
00:03:44,623 --> 00:03:45,791
IF YOU'RE THE ROMANTIC TYPE, YOU

116
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,093
AND THE MISSUS COULD GO TOGETHER

117
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,594
IN ONE OF THEM SIDE-BY-SIDE

118
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:51,163
REFRIGERATOR/FREEZER UNITS.

119
00:03:51,163 --> 00:03:52,064
SO ONCE YOU'VE GOT YOUR FREEZER,

120
00:03:52,064 --> 00:03:53,099
THEN YOU JUST PICK OUT THE

121
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,166
FINISH THAT YOU WANT ON IT.

122
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,301
YOU CAN HAVE OAK OR PINE OR

123
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,937
MAHOGANY OR, IN FACT, ANYTHING

124
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:58,871
THAT'S AVAILABLE IN THE MACTAC

125
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,973
LINE.

126
00:04:00,973 --> 00:04:02,842
AND FOR ABOUT 20 BUCKS' WORTH,

127
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,810
IT'S GONNA LOOK JUST BEAUTIFUL.

128
00:04:09,615 --> 00:04:11,417
IF YOU'VE NEVER MACTACCED

129
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,351
BEFORE, THIS IS AN IDEAL

130
00:04:12,351 --> 00:04:14,186
LEARNER'S PROJECT BECAUSE WHEN

131
00:04:14,186 --> 00:04:16,188
PEOPLE SEE IT, THEY'RE GONNA BE

132
00:04:16,188 --> 00:04:17,456
LOOKIN' AT IT THROUGH A VEIL OF

133
00:04:17,456 --> 00:04:19,225
TEARS, AND THEN LATER, IT'S

134
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,560
GONNA BE SIX FEET UNDER.

135
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,598
SO OPEN HER UP AND, UH...

136
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,233
OPEN HER UP.

137
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,268
THROW IN A HUNK OF FUN FUR FOR

138
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:32,638
YOUR LINING, AND YOU'RE READY TO

139
00:04:32,638 --> 00:04:34,607
PUT ON THE COFFIN HANDLES.

140
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,444
JUST USE A LITTLE BIT OF THE

141
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,745
HANDYMAN'S SECRET WEAPON ON

142
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:40,746
THAT, DUCT TAPE.

143
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:42,948
THESE ARE ACTUALLY TOWEL RACKS,

144
00:04:42,948 --> 00:04:43,949
AND THEY'RE CHEAP, BUT THEY LOOK

145
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:45,417
GOOD.

146
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:46,285
AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

147
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:47,453
THERE'S KIND OF A SUBTLE TIE-IN

148
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,088
TO THE OCCASION BECAUSE YOU ARE

149
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,223
THROWING IN THE TOWEL.

150
00:04:51,223 --> 00:04:52,825
NOW, WHAT ABOUT A HEADSTONE?

151
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,126
DO YOU HAVE TO GO THE BIG DOLLAR

152
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:55,794
FOR THE MARBLE OR THE GRANITE?

153
00:04:55,794 --> 00:04:56,896
I DON'T THINK SO.

154
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,864
WHAT ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

155
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,004
REMEMBER THIS FROM A FEW WEEKS

156
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:05,671
AGO?

157
00:05:05,671 --> 00:05:06,372
THIS IS A TOILET TANK.

158
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:08,040
IT WAS ORIGINALLY OUR CERAMIC

159
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,875
PORTABLE BEVERAGE COOLER, BUT IT

160
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,877
MAKES A DANDY LITTLE HEADSTONE.

161
00:05:11,877 --> 00:05:12,544
AND WE JUST PUT THESE

162
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:13,612
PEEL-AND-STICK LETTERS ON.

163
00:05:13,612 --> 00:05:16,148
A LOT CHEAPER THAN ENGRAVING.

164
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:17,583
AND THESE ARE ACTUALLY DESIGNED

165
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,385
FOR A MAILBOX, BUT WHEN YOU

166
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:20,886
THINK ABOUT IT, THIS IS YOUR NEW

167
00:05:20,886 --> 00:05:22,721
ADDRESS.

168
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:23,956
ANYWAY, YOU GET THE IDEA.

169
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,324
YOU CAN DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

170
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:26,258
IT'S CHEAP, AND IT'S JUST THAT

171
00:05:26,258 --> 00:05:27,159
EASY.

172
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:29,495
SO UNTIL NEXT TIME, REMEMBER.

173
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,496
IF THE WOMEN DON'T FIND YOU

174
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,031
HANDSOME, THEY SHOULD AT LEAST

175
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,433
FIND YOU HANDY.

176
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:35,901
HAROLD.

177
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:37,870
I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU HERE.

178
00:05:39,304 --> 00:05:40,105
WE'RE GONNA TAKE A BREAK FOR

179
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:41,073
SOME COMMERCIAL MESSAGES RIGHT

180
00:05:41,073 --> 00:05:42,107
NOW, BUT WHEN WE COME BACK, I'LL

181
00:05:42,107 --> 00:05:43,342
FINISH THE STORY ABOUT THE HOT

182
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,877
WATER BOTTLE.

183
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,045
>> OR YOU COULD JUST DO THE

184
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:46,879
STORY WHILE WE'RE AT

185
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,813
COMMERCIALS.

186
00:05:47,813 --> 00:05:49,782
THAT WOULD WORK TOO.

187
00:06:04,863 --> 00:06:06,331
>> IT IS SPRING.

188
00:06:06,331 --> 00:06:08,400
AT NIGHT, THE AIR IS CLEAR.

189
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,535
YOU CAN HEAR THE DISTANT HOWL

190
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,903
OF WOLVES.

191
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,538
THE SOUND PIERCES THE NIGHT,

192
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,740
SENDS SHIVERS UP YOUR SPINE,

193
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,175
PUTS NERVES ON EDGE.

194
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:17,242
THE LANGUAGE IS DIFFERENT,

195
00:06:17,242 --> 00:06:18,677
BUT WE WOODSMEN KNOW

196
00:06:18,677 --> 00:06:19,812
THE MESSAGE.

197
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,513
THE SAD AND LONELY WAIL

198
00:06:21,513 --> 00:06:22,214
THAT SAYS,

199
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:24,183
"I HAVEN'T HAD SEX ALL WINTER."

200
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:29,788
SO AS I WAS SAYING,

201
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:31,890
BUSTER HATFIELD REALLY LIKES

202
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,692
DANGEROUS GAMES, YOU KNOW?

203

I MEAN HE'S--HE'S NOT HAPPY

204
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:36,261
UNLESS HE'S RISKIN' HIS LIFE,

205
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:37,996
AND ACTUALLY WITH HIS CLUMSINESS

206
00:06:37,996 --> 00:06:39,765
AND ALL, HE'S HAPPY MOST OF THE

207
00:06:39,765 --> 00:06:41,533
TIME.

208
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:42,634
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HE WANTED US

209
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:43,335
TO DO?

210
00:06:43,335 --> 00:06:44,336
HE WANTED ALL THE GUYS TO TRY TO

211
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:45,671
BLOW UP ONE OF THEM HOT WATER

212
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,940
BOTTLES UNTIL IT EXPLODED.

213
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,974
HE'D SEEN A WRESTLER DO IT ON

214
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:49,908
ONE OF THEM EDUCATIONAL

215
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:51,977

216
00:06:51,977 --> 00:06:53,478
SO ANYWAY, WE GAVE HER A TRY.

217
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:54,713
WE MADE STINKY PETERSON GO LAST

218
00:06:54,713 --> 00:06:56,081
'CAUSE NOBODY WANTED TO PUT

219

225
00:07:03,655 --> 00:07:04,890
AND THEN HE TURNED TO THE SIDE,

226
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:05,824
AND WE COULD SEE THAT HIS LUNG

227
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:06,925
WAS COMIN' RIGHT OUT HIS EAR

228

GONNA FOOL AROUND, DO A

510
00:14:35,806 --> 00:14:38,275
LITTLE BIT OF ARCHERY.

511
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:39,777
I THINK MAYBE, YOU KNOW, HE

512
00:14:39,777 --> 00:14:41,078
SHOULD'VE WAIT UNTIL I GOT

513
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:45,315
THERE, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,

514
00:14:45,315 --> 00:14:46,917
YOU KNOW, ALL THINGS BEING

515
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:48,118
CONSIDERED, I'M KIND OF GLAD I

516
00:14:48,118 --> 00:14:50,087
DIDN'T WALK BACK THERE.

517
00:14:53,457 --> 00:14:54,725
YEAH, THAT'S A NICE TREAT.

518
00:14:54,725 --> 00:14:57,027
THANK YOU, BILL.

519
00:14:57,027 --> 00:14:59,063
AND HE HIT THE RAD REAL GOOD

520
00:14:59,063 --> 00:14:59,997
THERE.

521
00:14:59,997 --> 00:15:01,665
I BELIEVE THAT WAS ACTUALLY A

522
00:15:01,665 --> 00:15:03,133
NEW HOLE.

523
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:04,334
I WASN'T TOO HAPPY, BUT HE WAS

524
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:05,069
FINE.

525
00:15:05,069 --> 00:15:07,771
HE GOT HIS ARROW BACK.

526
00:15:07,771 --> 00:15:09,206
ANYWAY, HE STICKS A TARGET UP,

527
00:15:09,206 --> 00:15:11,341
AND THE IDEA IS THIS IS WHAT

528
00:15:11,341 --> 00:15:12,376
WE'RE GONNA TRY AND HIT, THE TWO

529
00:15:12,376 --> 00:15:13,977
OF US.

530
00:15:13,977 --> 00:15:15,479
NOW, BILL'S A BIT OF AN EXPERT

531
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:16,914
ON A BOW AND ARROW, AND I'VE

532
00:15:16,914 --> 00:15:18,782
REALLY NER--NEVER DONE ANYTHING

533
00:15:18,782 --> 00:15:20,684
WITH THAT.

534
00:15:20,684 --> 00:15:21,452
BUT HE TOLD ME, "NOW, YOU PUT

535
00:15:21,452 --> 00:15:22,119
THIS THING ON.

536
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:23,053
IT'S CALLED A QUIVER,"

537
00:15:23,053 --> 00:15:23,987
WHICH IS SOMETHING

538
00:15:23,987 --> 00:15:25,088
THAT YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE

539
00:15:25,088 --> 00:15:26,256
AROUND BILL AND HE HAS A BOW AND

540
00:15:26,256 --> 00:15:27,891
ARROW, BELIEVE ME.

541
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:28,759
AND HE SHOWED ME HOW TO HOLD IT

542
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:30,260
AND EVERYTHING, AND I THINK A

543
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,495
LOT OF TIMES IT'S EASIER

544
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:34,164
TO--MAYBE TO DO SOMETHING THAN

545
00:15:34,164 --> 00:15:36,033
TO SHOW SOMEBODY, YOU KNOW.

546
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:38,001
AND THEN YOU GET THE ARROW OUT

547
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:40,170
OF THERE AND, YOU KNOW, KIND OF

548
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,205
A ROBIN HOOD.

549
00:15:41,205 --> 00:15:42,206
NOW, BILL IS HAVIN' A FEW

550
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:43,707

MM-HMM. MM-HMM. MM-HMM.

557
00:15:55,152 --> 00:15:57,054
ALL RIGHT, SO WE'RE ALL SET UP

558
00:15:57,054 --> 00:16:01,391
THERE, AND--OH, NO.

559
00:16:01,391 --> 00:16:02,326
HE--THAT WAS GOOD OF HIM TO SHOW

560
00:16:02,326 --> 00:16:03,427
ME SOME OF THE THINGS THAT CAN

561
00:16:03,427 --> 00:16:07,764
GO WRONG WHEN YOU'RE--

562
00:16:07,764 --> 00:16:09,967
AND THEN THEY SEEM TO HAVE A

564

DIDN'T HAVE THESE PROBLEMS.

OKAY.

679
00:19:12,415 --> 00:19:13,216
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING,

680
00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:13,883
UNCLE RED.

681
00:19:13,883 --> 00:19:14,984
THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD RUSSIAN

682
00:19:14,984 --> 00:19:15,819
GYMNASTS.

683
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:17,787
BUT HAVE YOU EVER DRIVEN A LADA?

684
00:19:21,424 --> 00:19:22,926
>> WHAT'S YOUR POINT, HAROLD?

685
00:19:22,926 --> 00:19:24,394
>> WELL, I WAS HOPING MAYBE YOU

686
00:19:24,394 --> 00:19:25,929
WOULDN'T MIND PHONING MY DAD AND

687
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:27,130
GETTING ME EXCUSED FROM GYM FOR

688
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,565
THE REST OF THE YEAR, ESPECIALLY

689
00:19:28,565 --> 00:19:29,933
BEFORE WE HAVE THAT DANCE CLASS

690
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:33,002
WITH THE GIRLS NEXT WEEK.

691
00:19:33,002 --> 00:19:34,971
THINK ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW?

692
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,408
>> WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE

693
00:19:38,408 --> 00:19:39,509
OF THE SAME.

694
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:41,477
>> EVEN MORE SO, AND GOOD.

695
00:20:00,663 --> 00:20:01,731
>> IT'S A GREAT DAY FOR FISHIN',

696
00:20:01,731 --> 00:20:02,498
HAP.

697
00:20:02,498 --> 00:20:04,467
AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE.

698
00:20:04,467 --> 00:20:05,501
MIND YOU, WE GOT NO WAY OF

699
00:20:05,501 --> 00:20:07,804
TELLIN' IF THE FISH ARE BITIN'.

700
00:20:07,804 --> 00:20:08,671
>> NO, UNLESS WE WERE IN THE

701
00:20:08,671 --> 00:20:10,540
SUBMARINE.

702
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,407
>> WELL, THAT'S GONNA BE A TOUGH

703
00:20:11,407 --> 00:20:12,208
ONE, HAP.

704
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,176
I DON'T THINK THE LAUNCH RAMP AT

705
00:20:13,176 --> 00:20:14,010
THE MARINA COULD TAKE THE

706
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,244
WEIGHT.

707
00:20:15,244 --> 00:20:16,512
>> NO, THIS IS FRESH WATER.

708
00:20:16,512 --> 00:20:17,647
WHEN I WAS IN THE NAVY, WE

709
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:21,184
STAYED IN SALTWATER OCEANS.

710
00:20:21,184 --> 00:20:22,652
THE DEEPEST PARTS: CHASMS AND

711
00:20:22,652 --> 00:20:24,454
THE TRENCHES.

712
00:20:24,454 --> 00:20:25,555
>> I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE IN THE

713
00:20:25,555 --> 00:20:26,422
NAVY, HAP.

714
00:20:26,422 --> 00:20:27,423
WHAT YEAR WAS THAT?

715
00:20:27,423 --> 00:20:28,691
>> OH, THAT'S CLASSIFIED.

716
00:20:28,691 --> 00:20:30,093
MILITARY SECRETS.

717
00:20:30,093 --> 00:20:31,094
IT WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF THE COLD

718
00:20:31,094 --> 00:20:32,428
WAR.

719
00:20:32,428 --> 00:20:34,530
I JOINED THE UNDERSEA SERVICE.

720
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,632
SUBMARINES, OR AS WE USED TO

721
00:20:36,632 --> 00:20:40,937
CALL 'EM, SUBS.

722
00:20:40,937 --> 00:20:42,972
SIX MONTHS WITHOUT SEEING

723
00:20:42,972 --> 00:20:44,340
SUNLIGHT, UNDER SEA IN A NUCLEAR

724
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,442
SUB PLAYING CAT AND MOUSE WITH

725
00:20:46,442 --> 00:20:48,644
THE RUSSKIS.

726
00:20:48,644 --> 00:20:49,612
>> I DIDN'T THINK THERE WERE ANY

727
00:20:49,612 --> 00:20:50,580
NUCLEAR SUBS IN THE CANADIAN

728
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,050
NAVY, HAP.

729
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:54,784
>> THAT'S WHY I JOINED THE

730
00:20:54,784 --> 00:20:56,152
AMERICAN NAVY.

731
00:20:56,152 --> 00:20:57,653
THAT'S WHERE THE ACTION WAS.

732
00:20:57,653 --> 00:20:59,155
NUCLEAR SUBS LONG AS THREE

733
00:20:59,155 --> 00:21:01,157
FOOTBALL FIELDS.

734
00:21:01,157 --> 00:21:01,991
>> WOULD THAT BE AMERICAN

735
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:04,127
FOOTBALL FIELDS OR CANADIAN?

736
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,794
>> OH, THAT'S--THAT'S

737
00:21:04,794 --> 00:21:06,295
CLASSIFIED.

738
00:21:06,295 --> 00:21:07,063
I USED TO WORK IN THE ENGINE

739
00:21:07,063 --> 00:21:07,897
ROOM.

740
00:21:07,897 --> 00:21:09,432
I WAS A STOKER, STOKIN' THAT

741
00:21:09,432 --> 00:21:11,767
NUCLEAR FUEL.

742
00:21:11,767 --> 00:21:12,635
>> OH, NO, HAP, I--I THINK AND

743
00:21:12,635 --> 00:21:13,936
THEY JUST USE THE STOKERS ON

744
00:21:13,936 --> 00:21:16,506
THOSE COAL-POWERED SHIPS.

745
00:21:16,506 --> 00:21:17,573
>> [laughs]

746
00:21:17,573 --> 00:21:19,275
RED, YOU CAN'T--YOU CAN'T BURN

747
00:21:19,275 --> 00:21:20,476
COAL UNDER WATER.

748
00:21:20,476 --> 00:21:21,377
THE WATER WOULD COME DOWN THE

749
00:21:21,377 --> 00:21:22,945
CHIMNEY AND PUT THE FIRE OUT.

750
00:21:22,945 --> 00:21:24,180
NO, THIS WAS NUCLEAR FUEL.

751
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:28,751
URANIUM 287.

752
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:30,152
I'D FLING OPEN THE DOOR ON THAT

753
00:21:30,152 --> 00:21:32,455
NUCLEAR FURNACE AND SHOVEL IN A

754
00:21:32,455 --> 00:21:35,858
HEAP OF URANIUM, CLOSE THE DOOR.

755
00:21:35,858 --> 00:21:36,959
>> YOU MEAN TO SAY, HAP, YOU

756
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:38,327
JUST HAD PILES OF URANIUM LYIN'

757
00:21:38,327 --> 00:21:38,995
AROUND?

758
00:21:38,995 --> 00:21:40,596
YOU JUST WOULD SCOOP THAT UP?

759
00:21:40,596 --> 00:21:41,397
>> WELL, I DIDN'T HAVE TO USE A

760
00:21:41,397 --> 00:21:42,365
LOT.

761
00:21:42,365 --> 00:21:44,700
ONE SHOVELFUL WOULD POWER A SUB

762
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:49,272
FOR TWO MONTHS.

763
00:21:49,272 --> 00:21:51,173
AND I WORE LEAD PANTS.

764
00:21:51,173 --> 00:21:52,808
I HAD 400-POUND TROUSERS.

765
00:21:52,808 --> 00:21:55,311
THEY HAD TO WELD THE FLY SHUT.

766
00:21:55,311 --> 00:21:56,178
>> WELL, WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU

767
00:21:56,178 --> 00:21:58,314
HAD TO GO THE BATHROOM?

768
00:21:58,314 --> 00:21:59,749
>> YOU SEE, THAT'S--THAT'S TOP

769
00:21:59,749 --> 00:22:00,583
SECRET.

770
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:01,651
>> YEAH, I'LL BET.

771
00:22:01,651 --> 00:22:02,451
>> YEAH, WE HAD TO BE CLEARED.

772
00:22:02,451 --> 00:22:03,219
I'LL TELL YOU, WE HAD A FEW

773
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:04,620
CASUALTIES.

774
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,855
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, HAP, THEY SAY

775
00:22:05,855 --> 00:22:07,623
THAT IN WAR, THE FIRST CASUALTY

776
00:22:07,623 --> 00:22:09,759
IS THE TRUTH.

777
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:11,727
>> YEAH.

778
00:22:16,198 --> 00:22:18,401
>> WELL, BUSTER FINALLY GOT HIS

779
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:20,436
CHANCE TO BLOW UP THE HOT WATER

780
00:22:20,436 --> 00:22:22,104
BOTTLE, AND GOD, YOU KNOW,

781
00:22:22,104 --> 00:22:23,305
HE--HE DID REAL WELL,

782
00:22:23,305 --> 00:22:25,274
BUT HE GOT IT INFLATED TO THE

783
00:22:25,274 --> 00:22:26,409
POINT WHERE IT HAD FILLED UP THE

784
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:27,910
DEN AND IT WAS ACTUALLY SPILLING

785
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,879
OUT INTO THE LOBBY HERE.

786
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:30,713
YEAH, HE HAD HIS ARMS AND HIS

787
00:22:30,713 --> 00:22:32,081
LEGS WRAPPED AROUND IT THERE,

788
00:22:32,081 --> 00:22:33,182
AND YEAH, HE WAS DETERMINED HE

789
00:22:33,182 --> 00:22:34,116
WAS GONNA EXPLODE THE THING, YOU

790
00:22:34,116 --> 00:22:34,817
KNOW?

791
00:22:34,817 --> 00:22:35,651
BUT IT NEVER GOT THAT FAR

792
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:36,986
BECAUSE IT UNFORTUNATELY CAUGHT

793
00:22:36,986 --> 00:22:38,487
ON ONE OF THE ANTLERS WHICH

794
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:39,989
PUNCTURED A LITTLE HOLE IN

795
00:22:39,989 --> 00:22:41,490
THERE, AND GAH, THE AIR COME OUT

796
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,992
SO FAST THAT THE WHOLE RIG BLEW

797
00:22:42,992 --> 00:22:44,160
OUT THE SIDE DOOR AND SKIPPED

798
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,428
DOWN THE LAKE WITH BUSTER

799
00:22:45,428 --> 00:22:47,830
HANGIN' ON FOR DEAR LIFE.

800
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,798
YEAH, IT'S NOT EVERY DAY YOU GET

801
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:50,065
TO SEE A MAN RIDIN' A 15-FOOT

802
00:22:50,065 --> 00:22:52,668
RUBBER BLADDER.

803
00:22:52,668 --> 00:22:53,502
NO HARM DONE, THOUGH, 'CAUSE I

804
00:22:53,502 --> 00:22:55,004
MEAN IT PETERED OUT WAY BEFORE

805
00:22:55,004 --> 00:22:56,372
IT GOT TO THE FALLS, AND BUSTER

806
00:22:56,372 --> 00:22:58,674
JUST SWAM BACK.

807
00:22:58,674 --> 00:22:59,809
BUT NOW THE WHOLE AREA SMELLS

808
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:02,344
LIKE BUSTER'S BREATH.

809
00:23:02,344 --> 00:23:03,846
ANYWAY, IF MY WIFE IS WATCHIN'.

810
00:23:03,846 --> 00:23:05,147
I'M COMIN' STRAIGHT HOME

811
00:23:05,147 --> 00:23:06,515
TONIGHT, AND YES, I AM BRINGIN'

812
00:23:06,515 --> 00:23:08,150
THE TV GUIDE.

813
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,186
SO THANKS TO ALL OF YOU FOR

814
00:23:10,186 --> 00:23:11,820
TUNIN' US IN, AND UNTIL NEXT

815
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,855
TIME, ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND

816
00:23:12,855 --> 00:23:14,456
HAROLD AND THE WHOLE GANG UP

817
00:23:14,456 --> 00:23:16,258
HERE AT THE LODGE, KEEP YOUR

818
00:23:16,258 --> 00:23:18,194
STICK ON THE ICE.
