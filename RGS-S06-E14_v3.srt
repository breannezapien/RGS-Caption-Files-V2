1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:05,305
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

2
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:07,207
HERE'S THE MAN WHO INSPIRES US

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:07,941
TO BOLDLY GO WHERE

4
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:09,342
NO HANDYMAN HAS GONE BEFORE,

5
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:10,510
THE PSYCHIATRIC WARD,

6
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,846
YOUR HERO, MY UNCLE, RED GREEN!

7
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:14,781
(Applause and cheering)

8
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:17,984
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

9
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,020
THANK YOU.

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,755
APPRECIATE IT.

11
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,791
I WAS HOPING TO SHOW YOU

12
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:25,291
A BOAT PROJECT

13
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,259
WE'RE WORKING ON,

14
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:27,694
BUT WE'VE HAD A SET-BACK.

15
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,496
WE GOT
A NEW BOAT?

16
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:31,831
JUNIOR SINGLETON GOT

17
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:33,500
A BIG GRAVEL BARGES.

18
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:34,734
GONNA TURN HER INTO

19
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:38,138
A BASS BOAT -- 40-TON CAPACITY.

20
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,540
BIG ENOUGH FOR THE WHOLE LODGE.

21
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,675
JUST.

22
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,345
YOU'RE GONNA NEED

23
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:47,547
A BIGGER MOTOR TO PUSH IT.

24
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,115
WE'VE EACH GOT ONE.

25
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,152
YOU FIT THEM
ALL THE WAY AROUND THE SIDES.

26
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:53,486
EVERYBODY'S GOT
THEIR OWN MOTOR.

27
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:56,790
YEAH.

28
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,757
BUT IF EVERYBODY HAS

29
00:00:57,757 --> 00:00:59,559
THEIR OWN MOTOR,
HOW YOU GONNA STEER IT?

30
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:03,029
POINT YOUR MOTOR
WHERE YOU WANNA GO,

31
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:04,898
AND IF YOU CAN GET ENOUGH
HORSEPOWER TO AGREE WITH YA

32
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,366
YOU'RE GONNA GET THERE.

33
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,002
TALK ABOUT DEMOCRACY

34
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,304
IN ACTION --
SO WHAT'S THE HOLD-UP?

35
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,840
THERE'S NO REAL NICE WAY
TO PUT THIS,

36
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,042
BUT, JUNIOR'S
NO LONGER WITH US.

37
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,278
HE'S GONE.

38
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:19,779
JUNIOR SINGLETON'S DEAD?

39
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,948
NO, HAROLD, IT'S WORSE.

40
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,416
HE'S IN LOVE.

41
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:28,755
(Horns honking)

42
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:32,025
(Geese honking)

43
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,563
(Quacking)

44
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,135
(Red): YOU'RE LOOKIN'
AT SEGMENTS

45
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,436
FROM THIS PARTICULAR SHOW,

46
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,438
THE MESSAGE BEING,

47
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,440
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT CHANGING THE CHANNEL.

48
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,610
TO MAKE SENSE
OUT OF THIS PROGRAMME,

49
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,611
YOU GOTTA GIVE IT

50
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,379
YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.

51
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:02,822
JUNIOR SINGLETON'S
REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT A GIRL?

52
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,225
WHERE DID THEY MEET?

53
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,327
THEY MET AT ONE OF
TOOL-SWAP-MEET THINGS.

54
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,164
HER NAME IS NOREEN,
AND SHE WAS THERE

55
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,933
TRYING TO TRADE HER
BUTTERFLY IMPACT WRENCH,

56
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:16,035
AND ALONG COMES JUNIOR

57
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:20,607
WITH HIS FLEXIBLE-HEAD RATCHET
WITH TWO NUTS MISSING.

58
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,876
LOVE AT FIRST SWAP.

59
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,478
THEY GOT NOTHING IN COMMON.

60
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,947
I MEAN, SHE'S METRIC,
HE'S IMPERIAL.

61
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,050
CAN'T WORK.

62
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,485
SOUNDS LIKE YOU
DON'T WANT IT TO WORK,

63
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,154
UNCLE RED.

64
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,222
WE SHOULD HAVE
SEEN THIS COMING.

65
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:39,125
WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
THERE WAS A GIRL INVOLVED.

66
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,027
HE'S BEEN SO HAPPY LATELY,

67
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,863
SHAVING EVERY DAY,
EATING PROPERLY.

68
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,799
SAYING "EXCUSE ME,"
NO MATTER WHO DID IT.

69
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:51,037
(Laughing)

70
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,071
HE LOOKS THE SAME.

71
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:54,507
I SAW HIM GOING INTO NORTON'S
FEED AND VIDEOS.

72
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,442
HE WENT IN TO GET
"OUR MAN FLINT"

73
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,711
STARRING JAMES COBURN.

74
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:02,315
HE CAME OUT WITH "XANADU"
STARRING OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN.

75
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,185
THAT'S WHAT LOVE WILL DO.

76
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,421
WHY CAN'T JUNIOR WORK ON
THE BOAT AND SEE NOREEN?

77
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:09,923
ONCE NOREEN IS THERE

78
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,858
THEY GET INTO
THE MUSHY-FACE STUFF

79
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,227
AND YOU CAN'T CONCENTRATE.

80
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,328
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND

81
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,096
ONCE PUBERTY KICKS IN.

82
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,769
LATER, WE'RE GONNA HAVE
"ADVENTURES WITH BILL".

83
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,405
THESE BOYS ARE GOING TO
FORD THE STREAM.

84
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:26,406
IF I'D HAVE GONE
WITH THE VAN,

85
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,441
I WOULD HAVE DODGED THE STREAM.

86
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,443
A LITTLE AUTOMOTIVE HUMOUR.

87
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:35,114
THIS IS SOME KIND OF CAMP.

88
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:38,318
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT HIGH CAMP,
AND HOPEFULLY NOT "MEIN" CAMP.

89
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,352
IT'S JUST CAMP.

90
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:40,987
THEY'RE GONNA GET
A LITTLE DRINKING WATER.

91
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:44,224
THE WATER UP HERE IS LIKE
CRYSTAL-SPRING CLEAR.

92
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:49,262
YOU CAN TAKE IT RIGHT OUT OF
MANY OF THE LAKES AND STREAMS.

93
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,232
THIS ISN'T ONE OF THEM THOUGH.

94
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,667
NO, NO, NO, NO.

95
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,003
ALL RIGHT, YEAH, YEAH.

96
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,405
ALL RIGHT, FINE, YOU'RE FINE.

97
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,408
BILL, BEING AN AVID CAMPER,

98
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,778
HAS
WATER PURIFICATION TABLETS.

99
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:09,015
THAT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING
THAT HAS BEEN RE-LABELLED BY...

100
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,516
BY...

101
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,519
THAT SUGGESTS TO ME
THAT'S PROBABLY NOT --

102
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,021
OK, THEY'RE FINE.

103
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,724
THERE WE GO.

104
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,093
YOU JUST PUT
A FEW OF THOSE TABLETS

105
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,094
IN WITH YOUR WATER --

106
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,228
NOT TOO MANY NOW, BILL.

107
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,264
NO, I THINK YOU NEED TWO.

108
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,933
JUST THE TWO, TWO, TWO...

109
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,703
THEN YOU PUT THE WATER IN

110
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:33,106
AND YOU GET
A CHEMICAL REACTION.

111
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,242
THIS MAY BE WHY IT'S...

112
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:39,646
UH... BOYS, THAT'S A...

113
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,682
FELLAS, I THINK YOU PUT
A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

114
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:46,319
YOU'RE GETTING TOO MUCH,
TOO MUCH -- YOU MIGHT WANNA

115
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,121
GET THE TOP OFF.

116
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,322
YOU'VE GOT TIME.

117
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,190
TAKE THE TOP OFF.

118
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,559
GET IT OFF, GET IT OFF,
GET IT OFF.

119
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:58,364
THAT WAS ONLY A SUGGESTION.

120
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,833
YOU SHOULD HAVE LEFT
THE TOP ON THERE, GUYS.

121
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,268
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

122
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:08,374
ANYWAY, WHAT THEY HAVE THERE
IS CRYSTAL CLEAR RAIN,

123
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:09,409
AND CRYSTAL CLEAR FOG,

124
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,078
WHICH IS WHAT BILL AND HAROLD
ARE IN MOST OF THE TIME.

125
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,113
OH YEAH.

126
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,082
YOU STILL GOT A COUPLE --

127
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,650
THERE YOU GO.

128
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,287
YOU CAN AT LEAST PURIFY
YOUR OWN SALIVA, RIGHT, HAROLD?

129
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,823
HOPEFULLY
IT WILL STERILIZE HIM.

130
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,928
OH, THE MOUNTAIN IS HIGH

131
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:30,997
AND THE VALLEY IS LOW

132
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:34,300
IT'S THE LAWS OF NATURE
THAT MAKE IT SO

133
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,202
IF THE VALLEY
IS HIGH

134
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,571
AND THE MOUNTAIN IS LOW

135
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:42,141
YOU'RE EITHER UPSIDE DOWN
OR DRUNK OR BOTH

136
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:42,909
LOW

137
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:49,582
SHE TOLD YOU
WHERE TO PICK HER UP.

138
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:52,185
SHE TOLD YOU TO WRITE IT DOWN.

139
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,587
YOU TOLD HER
YOU DIDN'T NEED TO.

140
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:56,089
WHERE HAS THAT GOTTEN YA?

141
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:59,692
LOOKING FOR A HOUSE
THAT MAY HAVE YOUR WIFE IN IT.

142
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,762
THIS IS NOT YOUR FINEST HOUR.

143
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:06,165
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
REDEEM YOURSELF BIG-TIME.

144
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,201
THIS IS WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

145
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,870
RENT ONE OF
THOSE PORTABLE SIGNS,

146
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,673
THE ONES YOU TOW
BEHIND YOUR CAR.

147
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:16,576
MAKE UP A MUSHY SIGN
JUST FOR HER.

148
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,512
HOOK IT UP --
START DRIVING AROUND.

149
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,248
HONK YOUR HORN.

150
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,684
SHOUT HER NAME.

151
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,285
WHATEVER DRAWS A CROWD.

152
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:29,355
HOPEFULLY YOU'LL BE IN
THE RIGHT GENERAL AREA,

153
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,190
AND SHE'LL HEAR YOU COMING.

154
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,960
UNFORTUNATELY,
SO WILL ALL THE NEIGHBOURS.

155
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,395
THEY'LL ALL COME OUT,

156
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,996
AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO
PICK HER OUT IN THE CROWD.

157
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,431
YOO-HOO, HONEY.

158
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,033
YOU WILL BE PROFESSING
YOUR LOVE

159
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,736
IN FRONT OF PEOPLE
YOU'VE NEVER MET,

160
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:47,573
BUT SHE'LL NEVER SUSPECT
YOU FORGOT WHERE SHE WAS.

161
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,674
SURE, YOU'LL LOOK LIKE A DORK,

162
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:51,844
BUT IT'S BETTER THAN HER
FINDING OUT THE TRUTH.

163
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,346
THE IMPORTANT THING
IS THAT YOU FOUND HER.

164
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,382
AND YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING

165
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,851
THAT COULD BE VAGUELY CONSTRUED
AS ROMANTIC.

166
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,788
WE KNOW YOU'RE NOT ROMANTIC --
YOU'RE JUST STUPID.

167
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,094
THE BEAUTY OF WOOD FURNITURE

168
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,062
IS YOU CAN PAINT IT
ANY COLOUR YOU WANT,

169
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,564
BLACK, ORANGE, PURPLE,

170
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,767
WHATEVER GOES
WITH YOUR CURTAINS.

171
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:19,071
THIS CHAIR IS ONE BERNICE AND I
CALL OUR GUEST CHAIR.

172
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,574
A LOT OF MEMORIES
IN THIS CHAIR,

173
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,075
NOT HAPPY ONES.

174
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,445
IF I'M GOING TO STRIP
THAT CHAIR,

175
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,413
THERE HAVE GOT TO BE
10 COATS OF PAINT,

176
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:31,317
SO I'M GONNA NEED SOMETHING
POWERFUL TO TAKE THAT OFF.

177
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:35,188
REMEMBER, WHEN
YOU'RE TAKING THESE OFF,

178
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:36,789
YOU'RE TALKING...

179
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,424
KIND OF CORROSIVE-- OH!

180
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,959
VERY CORROSIVE STUFF.

181
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:43,296
I WOULD SUGGEST YOU GO WITH
THE PROTECTIVE-- AH!

182
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:49,535
I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU GO
WITH THE PROTECTIVE GLOVES,

183
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,171
UNLESS YOU REALLY ENJOY
A GOOD BURN.

184
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:58,578
AND, UH, YOU MIGHT WANNA WEAR
AN APRON, TOO, TO AVOID INJURY.

185
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:02,682
OR ARREST, OR FROSTBITE.

186
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,183
THERE WE GO.

187
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,384
WE GOT THE CHEMICAL ON THERE.

188
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:06,819
NOW WE, UH...

189
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:10,656
THE STUFF HAS STRIPPED
THE INSTRUCTIONS OFF THE CAN.

190
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,493
HMM?

191
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,393
WHAT?

192
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,496
WE WAIT?

193
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,431
ALL RIGHT,
HAROLD SAYS WE WAIT.

194
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:32,678
I'VE BEEN WAITING
UPWARDS OF TWO MINUTES.

195
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,780
NOTHING BUGS A HANDYMAN MORE

196
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,383
THAN A STRIPPER
THAT WORKS TOO SLOW.

197
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,786
I THINK WE GOTTA SPIKE UP
OUR CHEMICAL MIX,

198
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,189
THROW SOME NORMAL STRIPPER IN.

199
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,725
I GOT THIS OTHER,
SPECIAL STUFF.

200
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,094
GOT THIS FROM MY GRANDFATHER.

201
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,697
THEY FOUND IT IN THE BARN
AFTER THE COW DIED.

202
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,766
OH BOY, SHE'S PRETTY THICK.

203
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,701
THAT SHOULD DO THE TRICK.

204
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:57,203
OH MY!

205
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,305
GET THAT ON THE CHAIR.

206
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,613
WE GOT A FEW LAYERS OFF.

207
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:10,049
I'D SAY WE'RE BACK TO
ABOUT 1978.

208
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,218
BUT WE'RE STILL NOT DOWN TO
BARE WOOD.

209
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,887
SO I THINK WE NEED TO SWITCH
TO SOMETHING STRONGER.

210
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:19,125
I GOT A GREAT MIX
GOING IN HERE.

211
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,626
I GOT BLEACH.

212
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,329
I GOT CAUSTIC SODA.

213
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,098
I GOT DRAIN CLEANER,
NAIL POLISH REMOVER,

214
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,600
AMMONIA, PEROXIDE,

215
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,203
AND SIX BOTTLES OF
MR. GOUDA'S SNAPPY POP.

216
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:34,106
ALL I NEED TO DO
IS TAKE MY CAR BATTERY

217
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,709
AND JUMP START
THE WHOLE SHEBANG.

218
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,148
BY GOLLY.

219
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:46,185
BETTER GET THIS ON THE CHAIR
BEFORE IT EATS THROUGH THE POT.

220
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:55,494
THERE WE GO.

221
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,530
CHAIR'S SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT.

222
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,032
MUST HAVE BEEN
MORE PAINT ON THERE...

223
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,534
THAT CHEMICAL IS...

224
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,370
WE HAVEN'T JUST REFINISHED
THE CHAIR.

225
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,205
WE'VE ACTUALLY FINISHED IT.

226
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,975
REMEMBER, IF WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME

227
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,444
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

228
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,649
DOESN'T SURPRISE ME.

229
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:20,620
RELAX -- WHATEVER THIS IS,
WE GOT MORE OF IT.

230
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,093
I WANNA TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING

231
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,395
THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY
ALREADY AWARE OF.

232
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,196
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

233
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,565
HOW MANY THINGS
THERE ARE TO KNOW,

234
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,233
YOU DON'T KNOW MANY OF THEM.

235
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:38,437
WHEN YOU WERE A TEENAGER
YOU KNEW EVERYTHING.

236
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:39,572
BUT DIDN'T YOU FIND THAT

237
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,107
THE SMARTER YOU GOT
THE LESS YOU KNEW.

238
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,643
NOW YOU CAN BARELY FIND
YOUR CAR KEYS.

239
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:48,247
A LOT OF GUYS LEARN
ALL THERE IS TO KNOW

240
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:52,251
ABOUT SOME OBSCURE TOPIC,
LIKE STUDEBAKER HOOD ORNAMENTS,

241
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:55,755
THEN TRY TO WORK THAT
INTO EVERY CONVERSATION.

242
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:58,958
THEY'LL SAY "THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES,

243
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,261
"THAT'S A PERSON THAT
PEOPLE LOOK TO, A SYMBOL.

244
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,896
"YOU KNOW WHAT IT
REMINDS ME OF?

245
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,931
"HOOD ORNAMENTS."

246
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,933
HERE'S A BETTER IDEA.

247
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:10,503
TRY DO WHAT WOMEN DO.

248
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,674
IT'S CALLED LISTENING.

249
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,009
WOMEN HAVE MASTERED THE ART
OF LISTENING TO PEOPLE

250
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,045
GO ON AND ON ABOUT SOMETHING

251
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,347
THAT NO ONE HAS
ANY INTEREST IN.

252
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,282
THINGS LIKE HOOD ORNAMENTS.

253
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,553
SO TRY LISTENING TO SOMEONE.

254
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,989
THEY WON'T MIND THAT
YOU'RE NOT SAYING ANYTHING.

255
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,591
THEY'LL THINK YOU'RE AGREEING
WITH THEIR OPINIONS,

256
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:35,461
AND, IN THEIR MINDS,
YOU'LL BE BRILLIANT.

257
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,029
HERE'S THE BEST PART.

258
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,097
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRETEND
TO BE SMARTER

259
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,132
THAN THE PERSON
YOU'RE LISTENING TO.

260
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,234
CHANCES ARE YOU'RE NOT.

261
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,137
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YA.

262
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,440
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

263
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:56,716
WHAT STARTED AS A GREAT IDEA
IS A BIG PAIN IN THE NECK.

264
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,818
WE GOT JUNIOR
WORKING ON THE BOAT AGAIN.

265
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:01,020
NOW HE BRINGS NOREEN
WITH HIM.

266
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,456
SHE IS THE YOKO ONO
OF BASS BARGES.

267
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:06,525
(Audience laughing)

268
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,160
UNCLE RED, YOU'RE
JUST UNCOMFORTABLE

269
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,628
HAVING WOMEN AROUND.

270
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,163
NO, I'M NOT, HAROLD.

271
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,532
IF MY WIFE, BERNICE,
WAS WORKING--

272
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,367
OK, THAT'S A BAD EXAMPLE.

273
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:16,969
BUT THERE ARE

274
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:19,438
PLENTY OF WOMEN WHO WOULD BE
AN ADDITION TO THE TEAM.

275
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,107
LIKE THAT WOMAN ON "HOME TIME"

276
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,509
OR MARTINA NAVRATILOVA --
SOMEONE LIKE THAT.

277
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,313
BALONEY, BALONEY, BALONEY,
BALONEY, BALONEY!

278
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,615
NOREEN'S A REAL HELPFUL
KIND OF PERSON.

279
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,617
SHE GOT THE GENERATOR STARTED

280
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:32,618
WHEN YOU GUYS
COULDN'T.

281
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,954
SHE KNOWS
WHEN YOU'RE LOST.

282
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:37,656
THAT'S GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

283
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:40,192
SHE'S JUST NOT ONE OF THE GUYS.

284
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,228
HUGGING AND KISSING
MAKES EVERYBODY FEEL BAD.

285
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,196
THE GUYS WHO DON'T HAVE GIRLS
FEEL BAD.

286
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:47,633
THE MARRIED GUYS START THINKING
ABOUT WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN,

287
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,701
OR SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN

288
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,936
IF THERE WAS A KIND,
COMPASSIONATE GOD.

289
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,306
IF YOU GUYS GOT PROBLEMS
IN YOUR RELATIONSHIPS,

290
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:55,908
IT'S ALWAYS YOUR FAULT.

291
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,477
YOU GUYS COULD CHANGE.

292
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,479
WE DON'T WANT
TO CHANGE!

293
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,114
WHY DO YOU THINK
WE STARTED THE LODGE?

294
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:15,261
(Siren)

295
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:20,199
POSSUM 911 -- PLEASE STATE
YOUR MEMBERSHIP CARD NUMBER!

296
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,034
OH, UH, HI, HAROLD.

297
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,702
UH, IS RED THERE?

298
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:26,138
UH, HI, MR. ROTHSCHILD,
WHAT'S UP?

299
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,073
OH, NOTHING, YOU KNOW?

300
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,809
JUST... JUST DRIVING AROUND.

301
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,144
OK, SO WHAT'S THE EMERGENCY?

302
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,380
UH, NO... NO EMERGENCY, HAROLD.

303
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,149
WELL, YOU DID DIAL
THE 911 POSSUM LINE.

304
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,918
OH, DID I? OH, SORRY.

305
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:42,087
I THOUGHT I WAS CALLING 411,
ACTUALLY.

306
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,656
YEAH, INFORMATION.

307
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,659
OK, WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION
WOULD YOU LIKE, SIR?

308
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,561
IS... IS RED THERE OR, UH...

309
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,665
IT'S OK TO ADMIT THAT
YOU'RE LOST, MR. ROTHSCHILD.

310
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,766
I CAN GIVE YOU DIRECTIONS.

311
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:57,837
LOST?! HAH!
PLEASE, HAROLD, I'M NOT LOST.

312
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,039
NEVER BEEN LOST
A DAY IN MY LIFE.

313
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,875
YOU'RE LOST,
IF YOU'RE THINKING THAT WAY.

314
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,210
IS RED THERE?

315
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,678
YEAH, I'M HERE, WINSTON.

316
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,479
I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE JUST
DRIVING AROUND TONIGHT.

317
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,782
YEAH, JUST, UH, YOU KNOW,
COMING BACK

318
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:13,185
FROM AN ESTATE SALE
OVER AT GREEN SLIME HARBOUR,

319
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,188
AND NOW I'M JUST KINDA
GOING HOME.

320
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,358
JUST NOTICED THAT THEY TOOK
THE OLD WATER TOWER DOWN.

321
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,960
NO, IT'S STILL THERE.

322
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,231
IT'S JUST WEST OF FLINTY
McCLINTOCK'S SCRAP METAL YARD.

323
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,599
RIGHT.

324
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,468
OH... OH, WEST
OF FLINTY'S PLACE... YEAH.

325
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:32,238
YEAH, WHICH IS JUST NORTH
OF THE LODGE.

326
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,572
OK.

327
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,107
YOU KNOW, WINSTON,

328
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,141
ON A COMPLETELY
UNRELATED MATTER,

329
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:39,745
WE'RE HAVING PROBLEMS HERE
WITH THE ELECTRICAL.

330
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,982
A LOT OF SHORTS AND THE LIGHTS
ARE FLICKERING REAL BAD.

331
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,251
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HECK'S GOING ON.

332
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,952
OK! WOW! LOOK AT THAT!

333
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,255
THEY SURE ARE SPARKING, THERE.

334
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,756
YEAH.

335
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:54,793
WELL, BOB'S YOUR UNCLE,
MOLLY'S YOUR AUNT.

336
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:56,495
I CAN SEE 'EM FROM HERE.

337
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,497
THANKS, RED --
I'LL BE RIGHT OVER.

338
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:03,969
LOOKS LIKE IT'S JUST A RIGHT
TURN, A LEFT, AND ANOTHER LEFT.

339
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:04,803
NO, ANOTHER RIGHT.

340
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,805
THAT'S WHAT I SAID!

341
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,543
(Red): TIME FOR
"ADVENTURES WITH BILL".

342
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:14,013
THE TWO LADS ARE GONNA CROSS
THE STREAM.

343
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:15,848
MY DAD ONCE TOLD ME

344
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:19,985
THAT THE JOURNEY OF LIFE
IS CROSSING A STREAM,

345
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:21,654
AND SOMETIMES YOU GET ONTO
A WIGGLY ROCK

346
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,989
AND YOU GOTTA GET OFF THAT
RIGHT AWAY.

347
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:27,393
HE SAID, "THE MOST DANGEROUS
ROCKS ARE THE BIG FLAT ONES,

348
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:30,863
"'CAUSE YOU WANT TO LIE DOWN
AND SUN YOURSELF ON THEM."

349
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,932
THAT WASN'T A DANGEROUS ONE.

350
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:37,536
YOU WANT TO SUN YOURSELF
ON A BIG ROCK.

351
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,571
YOU DON'T WANT TO MOVE ON,
BUT YOU GOTTA MOVE ON.

352
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:40,639
OH, THERE YOU GO.

353
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,840
MOVE ON, HAROLD, MOVE ON.

354
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,142
AWAY YOU GO -- ATTABOY.

355
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:46,478
SO BILL TAKING
THE BACKPACK OFF.

356
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:47,980
RESOURCEFULNESS IS THE SECRET

357
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,548
TO ALL CAMPING TRIPS.

358
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,984
HE WHIPS OUT...
WHAT IS THAT, NOW?

359
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,286
THAT WOULD BE...
THAT WOULD BE A ROPE.

360
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,021
WE HAVE A ROPE IN HIS PANTS.

361
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:59,425
BE INTERESTING TO WATCH BILL
GET DRESSED IN THE MORNING.

362
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,759
NO, PROBABLY NOT

363
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,896
AFTER BREAKFAST -- ANYWAY,
HE THROWS THAT ACROSS.

364
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,264
AND HE LASSEES--

365
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,966
RESOURCEFULNESS --
THERE WE GO AGAIN --

366
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,335
LASSOS A TREE THING
THAT WAS HANGING THERE,

367
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,837
PROBABLY FROM
A PREVIOUS TRIP OF THEIRS.

368
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,807
HE HAS HAROLD GO
AND TIE THE OTHER END.

369
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,142
HAROLD DOES THOSE FANCY KNOTS

370
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,545
HE LEARNED FROM WATCHING
"THE SMURFS".

371
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,313
THERE YOU GO, HAROLD --
END OVER END,

372
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,749
UP AND OVER, INSIDE OUT.

373
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:27,052
WHAT BILL'S GONNA DO IS
JUST USE THAT--

374
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,320
THERE WE GO.

375
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,888
OH, MY GOSH.

376
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:33,592
HE'S GONNA USE THAT TO HOLD
HIMSELF UP, TAKE THE WEIGHT.

377
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,895
YOU GOTTA REALIZE
THAT PROFESSIONAL CAMPERS

378
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:39,531
WOULD USE A WIRE CABLE
OR A PRE-...

379
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:42,768
A PRE-STRETCHED...
MAYBE NOT A COTTON.

380
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:45,204
MAYBE SOMETHING THAT
DOESN'T HAVE THE GIVE.

381
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:48,907
BILL HAS NOT PREPARED
AS WELL AS HE SHOULD HAVE.

382
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,242
AM I RIGHT?

383
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,745
YEAH, YEAH!

384
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:56,648
ANYWAY, I SEE -- HE'S STAYING
WITH THE THEORY, YOU KNOW?

385
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:59,018
BILL HAS A WAY
OF IGNORING THE EVIDENCE.

386
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,287
HAROLD HAS THE EVIDENCE
AND I IGNORE THAT, MYSELF.

387
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,922
HE GOT ACROSS,
THAT'S THE MAIN THING.

388
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:06,325
THERE'S THE RESOURCEFULNESS
KICKING IN.

389
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,593
LIKE A TOWEL, BILL?

390
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,261
WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?

391
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,864
WELL, NOW, WAIT A SEC.

392
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,600
HOW DID HAROLD GET ACROSS?

393
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,701
YOU WERE ON THE OTHER SIDE.

394
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,602
HOW DID YOU GET--

395
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:17,836
OH, RESOURCEFULNESS!

396
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,238
(Laughing)

397
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,506
IT'S A BRIDGE, BILL.

398
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:21,874
HUH? YEAH.

399
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,142
THROW IN THE TOWEL.

400
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,910
THROW IT IN, THROW IT IN.

401
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,545
AND DON'T WORRY, FOLKS.

402
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,914
WHEREVER THEY GO,
THEY'LL BE LOST.

403
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,218
HERE ARE SOME CARTOON DRAWINGS
SENT BY SOME VIEWERS.

404
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,125
WELL, GOOD NEWS.

405
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,694
WE GOT OUR BARGE AND
OUR JUNIOR BACK ON TRACK.

406
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,930
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELF.

407
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,434
WHY? JUNIOR AND LITTLE NOREEN
HAD A FIGHT.

408
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,902
NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.

409
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,170
THEY'RE NOT EVEN ENGAGED

410
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,106
AND SHE'S ASKING JUNIOR
ABOUT HAVING KIDS.

411
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:57,409
SHE SAID SHE WANTED TO BUILD
LOCKERS FOR LIFE-JACKETS.

412
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,245
WHEN DID YOU SEE
ADULTS WEARING LIFE-JACKETS?

413
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,915
(Audience laughing)

414
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,452
SHE WAS GETTING JUNIOR
ONTO A SLIPPERY SLOPE.

415
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:07,920
YOU COULD TELL HE WASN'T
COMFORTABLE WITH THE SUBJECT.

416
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,354
WELL, WHO WOULD BE?

417
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,557
ALL THE LODGE MEMBERS
GOADING HIM ON,

418
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:12,991
POKING HIM IN THE RIBS.

419
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,161
I LOVE WHEN THEY HAVE
THOSE POLITE FIGHTS.

420
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:18,564
"DEAR...

421
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,599
"I THINK YOU'RE WRONG."

422
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,934
"NO, NO,
NO, NO.

423
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,036
"IT'S YOU
THAT IS WRONG."

424
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,205
"NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

425
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,006
"LET'S GO DISCUSS THIS
IN THE CAR."

426
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,641
"FINE, FINE, FINE, FINE!"

427
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,511
AND ALL THROUGH
THE CLENCHED TEETH.

428
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,713
CLENCHED TEETH, LIKE THAT.

429
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,616
IF JUNIOR GOT ANY MORE CORDIAL,
HE'D SNAP HIS UPPER PLATE.

430
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:40,786
I HOPE
THEY'RE OK.

431
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,154
YEAH, SURE THEY ARE.

432
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:45,390
THAT'S THE SECOND STAGE
OF A RELATIONSHIP -- ANGER.

433
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,925
RELATIONSHIPS HAVE STAGES?

434
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,495
YOU GOT DENIAL,
THEN YOU GOT ANGER,

435
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:50,562
THEN YOU GOT BARGAINING...

436
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,532
THOSE ARE THE STAGES
OF DEATH AND MOURNING.

437
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:55,667
AND MARRIAGE, HAROLD.

438
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,236
OH, YEAH, AND MARRIAGE.

439
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,272
IT'S THAT PART OF THE SHOW

440
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,707
WHERE WE EXAMINE
THOSE THREE WORDS

441
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,675
THAT MEN FIND
SO DIFFICULT TO SAY.

442
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,145
(Audience):
"I DON'T KNOW!"

443
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,813
I LOVE WHEN THEY DO THAT.

444
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,817
ALL RIGHT, JOINING MY UNCLE RED
ON THE EXPERT PORTION

445
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,919
IS HIS BEST FRIEND,
MR. HAP SHAUGHNESSY.

446
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,054
APPLAUSE, APPLAUSE, APPLAUSE.

447
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:17,556
(Applause)

448
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,591
OK, UM... OK, OK, OK, OK!

449
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:22,494
"DEAR EXPERTS, I AM A STUDENT
AT A HIGH SCHOOL

450
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,531
"IN A FARAWAY PLACE,
NOT NEAR POSSUM LAKE.

451
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,499
"UNLIKE YOUR HANDSOME NEPHEW,
HAROLD,

452
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,169
"I AM HAVING TROUBLE
AT SCHOOL WITH BULLIES.

453
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,303
"WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT THIS?

454
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,005
"SIGNED, IVAN IVANOVITCH."

455
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,407
(Audience laughing)

456
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,011
WELL, IVAN, YOU MAY NOT BE
AS HANDSOME AS HAROLD,

457
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,781
BUT YOU HAVE EXACTLY
THE SAME HANDWRITING.

458
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:43,949
(Harold):
THAT'S ODD.

459
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,417
(Laughing)

460
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,186
OK, UH, IVAN.

461
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,620
IVAN...
YOU KNOW.

462
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,955
ALL RIGHT.

463
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,758
IVAN, THE BEST WAY
TO DEAL WITH BULLIES

464
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,327
IS TO LEARN ONE OF THEM
SELF-DEFENCE THINGS.

465
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,096
THEY GOT THE JUDO
AND THE TAE KWON-DO.

466
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:01,266
YEAH, AND
THE FAH-SO LA-TI-DO.

467
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,369
PARDON ME, HAP?

468
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,637
FAH-SO LA-TI-DO.

469
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:09,041
IT'S A MARTIAL ARTS TECHNIQUE
THAT I DEVELOPED

470
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,176
WHEN I WAS DWIGHT EISENHOWER'S
BODYGUARD.

471
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,612
(Audience laughing)

472
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,480
(Harold): I NEVER HEARD
OF FAH-SO LA-TI-DO.

473
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,982
I SANG IT A FEW TIMES.

474
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,918
I ONLY TAUGHT IT
TO A FEW PEOPLE.

475
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,421
IT'S A TECHNIQUE
THAT COMBINES KARATE,

476
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:25,424
JUDO, NINJA, AND, UH,
RHYTHMIC GYMNASTICS.

477
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,226
(Audience laughing)

478
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,594
RHYTHMIC GYMNASTICS?!

479
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,662
ISN'T THAT WHERE YOU DO
THE GYMNASTICS

480
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,264
WITH THE RUBBER BALL AND BATON

481
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:33,732
AND YOU WAVE
THEM BIG RIBBONS AROUND?

482
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,000
THAT'S THE ONE.

483
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,669
I GOT A SILVER FOR THAT
IN THE '52 OLYMPICS.

484
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:40,672
I THOUGHT
RHYTHMIC GYMNASTICS

485
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,040
WAS A FEMALE
COMPETITION.

486
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,044
(Audience laughing)

487
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:48,780
I KNOW -- I SNUCK IN
WITH THE RUSSIAN WOMEN.

488
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:58,156
(Laughing and applause)

489
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:02,628
WELL, THE BARGE IS READY AND
JUNIOR'S ALL SET TO CAST OFF.

490
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:03,195
WHOA!

491
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,264
WHAT ABOUT HIS GIRLFRIEND --
IS SHE GOING?

492
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,400
NO, NOREEN'S WITH HER FRIENDS
AND JUNIOR'S WITH HIS.

493
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,168
AW, THEY BROKE UP.

494
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:13,805
NO, THEY HAD THEIR FIGHT --
THAT WAS THE BARGAINING PART.

495
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:16,975
NOW THEY'RE INTO THE FINAL
STAGE -- ACCEPTANCE.

496
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,110
NO MORE FALSE PRETENCES,

497
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,479
NO MORE BEING
ON YOUR BEST BEHAVIOUR.

498
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,315
(Laughing)

499
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,284
THAT WAS JUNIOR'S
BEST BEHAVIOUR?

500
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,988
NO, HAROLD, THEY'VE REACHED THE
BEST PART OF A RELATIONSHIP.

501
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,089
THEY'RE COMFORTABLE
WITH EACH OTHER.

502
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,392
THEY'RE NOT SPENDING TIME
TOGETHER.

503
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:34,626
THEY'RE GIVING EACH OTHER
SPACE.

504
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,130
THEY'RE TAKING EACH OTHER
FOR GRANTED.

505
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,133
THEY ACCEPT THE PERSON
FOR WHAT THEY ARE.

506
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,836
WHEN I'M MARRIED,
I'LL SPEND TIME WITH MY WIFE,

507
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:47,773
TEND TO HER NEEDS,
AND BE THERE FOR HER.

508
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,576
WHEN I HAVE A ROLLS ROYCE,
I'LL WASH AND WAX IT EVERY DAY.

509
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,712
(Audience laughing)

510
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,648
(Laughing)

511
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,317
YOU'LL NEVER HAVE
A ROLLS ROYCE.

512
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,117
RIGHT.

513
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:01,353
(Laughing and applause)

514
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:02,888
(Possum squeal)

515
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,356
OH!

516
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,291
MEETING TIME, HAROLD.

517
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,593
AWAY YOU GO, AWAY YOU GO.

518
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,729
I'M JUST KIDDING YOU!

519
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:11,930
YOU'LL PROBABLY GET MARRIED.

520
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,433
HEY, LYLE LOVETT MARRIED
JULIA ROBERTS,

521
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:15,233
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

522
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,369
YEAH! YEAH!

523
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,471
MIND YOU,
IT ONLY LASTED ABOUT AN HOUR.

524
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,940
(Laughing)

525
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,877
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

526
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:27,979
I'M COMING RIGHT HOME
AFTER WE DO SOME FISHING.

527
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:29,648
I'M PLANNING TO IGNORE YOU,

528
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,283
TAKE YOU FOR GRANTED,
NOT TALK TO YOU,

529
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,385
AND I'M HOPING YOU'RE IN
A ROMANTIC MOOD, TOO.

530
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,355
THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

531
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,591
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND HAROLD AND THE GANG,

532
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:41,226
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

533
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:43,762
(Applause and cheering)

534
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,533
(Possum squeal)

535
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:52,070
(Red): ALL RIGHT, HAROLD.

536
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:55,741
(Harold): UP AND AT 'EM,
DO YOUR BUSINESS.

537
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:01,680
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

538
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,781
(Red): SIT DOWN.

539
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,784
JUNIOR SINGLETON WANTED ME

540
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,152
TO ANNOUNCE THAT HE HAS

541
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,920
AN '82 PACER THAT HE WOULD LIKE

542
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,622
TO TRADE FOR A GARBAGE CAN...

543
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,558
OR A GREMLIN CONVERTIBLE.
