1
00:00:01,901 --> 00:00:04,137
It's the new Red Green Show.

2
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:08,475
And now here's the man you've been
waiting for. Not Godot.

3
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:11,845
More like God, no. You're here
and my uncle Red Green.

4
00:00:23,389 --> 00:00:28,128
All right. You know, I golly, thanks for
coming big kerfuffle this week up with the

5
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:32,198
lines over the old man Sedgwick's Place
turned out his son showed up right on his

6
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:32,999
front doorstep.

7
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:36,069
Wow, I didn't even know old man Sedgwick had
a son.

8
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:37,537
No, neither did he, Harold.

9
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:44,744
You know, you get old, you forget things,
you don't forget his son, nobody forgets a

10
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:46,579
son. I'm trying to forget a nephew.

11
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:52,318
Wow.

12
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:58,558
Anyway, causing real problems over an old
man, Sedgwick's place that son there being

13
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,393
around is really putting a lot of strain on
the old guy.

14
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:01,861
How old is he, exactly?

15
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:05,498
Don't know for sure. Harold, our our best
guess is he's about ninety seven.

16
00:01:05,798 --> 00:01:06,499
Wow.

17
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,368
How old are you, son? I'm talking about his
son.

18
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:26,185
What you're looking at

19
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:28,054
Now is a bunch of segments from this

20
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:29,122
Particular show.

21
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:33,693
The main message being, for gosh sakes,
don't even think about changing the channel.

22
00:01:34,193 --> 00:01:37,063
I'll tell you something you want to make
sense out of this program.

23
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:38,531
You've got to give it your undivided
attention.

24
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:48,741
I'll tell you, you don't want to go anywhere
near old man Sedgwick's Place now that his

25
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:49,942
son has moved back in.

26
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:54,113
Talk about two old crappy guys and walk them
by the yell, Hey dork!

27
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,281
Pick a gender.

28
00:02:07,593 --> 00:02:10,496
Boy, that's that's cruel.

29
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,000
And speaking of cruel,

30
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:19,439
Here's a little taste of what we got later in
the show when The Adventures with Bill.

31
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:24,811
Actually, this is more than a little taste,
and that may be that may be a mistake because

32
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:29,916
with Bill, you know, a lot of times a little
taste is all you ever want, right, bill?

33
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:36,055
Bill, Oh, I rest my case and most of my
adult body.

34
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,725
Anyway, what this is is kind of a certain
life as a circus.

35
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:41,027
And there you go, Bill.

36
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,430
And I thought this wasn't going to be any
fun.

37
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:51,270
Oh. Anyway, as I was saying before, a little
bit of a circus thing.

38
00:02:52,371 --> 00:02:53,439
Bill wants me to climb up the ladder.

39
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,776
He's going to do that kind of a flying,
flying Wallenda thing.

40
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,378
He's going to go up, I'm going to go down,
then I'm going to catch him.

41
00:02:59,378 --> 00:03:01,781
That's the way that's going to work. Yeah,
that's the plan.

42
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,416
Anyway, that is the plan.

43
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,785
And, you know, all plans go.

44
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:11,190
Anyway, I did my work perfectly, but that
was just I.

45
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,127
Now I might. I say, Bill's a little heavy
and we got to relieve the tension on the

46
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:17,730
board. Well, here's why you're OK.

47
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,765
This is kind of a quick weight lamp.

48
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,767
Why you got a lot of stuff in the air.

49
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:23,736
Imagine him going through the metal
detector.

50
00:03:24,603 --> 00:03:26,706
Holy mackerel, man.

51
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,407
That's a that's easy. He's really,

52
00:03:28,607 --> 00:03:30,076
Really packing iron.

53
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:31,844
What the heck was that?

54
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,412
It's a power saw.

55
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,881
It's a flexible hose on there.

56
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:40,886
That's a valve. A caulking gun.

57
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:42,221
They're still nothing.

58
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:45,057
So I should don't forget one thing a little
washer.

59
00:03:45,424 --> 00:03:48,127
Here goes. Oh, boy, he's up there.

60
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,395
I'll get you, Bill, I'll get you, I'll get
you.

61
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:53,432
Yeah, I lost you in the Sun bill.

62
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,468
That's all that was. More on that later.

63
00:03:59,271 --> 00:04:01,741
Oh, I had one whisker on the end of my
nose.

64
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:05,277
And the more I shave it, the more it grows.

65
00:04:05,544 --> 00:04:10,316
I waxed and scratched it till it was 14
inches long, and then it was hit by lightning

66
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,118
and I was forced to rethink the whole
project.

67
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:16,889
Ok, this is for the big one.

68
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:19,091
Two hundred road apples and a free juicer.

69
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,061
Uncle Red, you have 30 seconds.

70
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:25,431
Get Mr. Dalton Humphries of the Humphreys
Everything store to say this word.

71
00:04:26,198 --> 00:04:27,867
Laugh.

72
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,470
And go.

73
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:35,541
All right, Dalton, when your wife tells a
joke, you cringe.

74
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:40,479
When I tell a joke, you don't get it.

75
00:04:42,948 --> 00:04:47,853
All right, all right, at the circus, the
clowns make us angry.

76
00:04:49,855 --> 00:04:53,058
All right. Somebody comes into your store
and they ask you for a discount.

77
00:04:53,058 --> 00:04:56,061
You'll go along with it, you know, you shake
hands, you smile and you have a good

78
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:56,996
discount.

79
00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:58,464
Don't make me laugh.

80
00:05:04,036 --> 00:05:07,973
This week on Handymen Corner, I thought I
would do something for all of you people

81
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:11,744
who've always wanted to join the volunteer
fire department but never have.

82
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,078
Maybe you don't have time.

83
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:14,580
Maybe you can't pass a physical.

84
00:05:14,813 --> 00:05:18,384
Or maybe you just don't want to spend your
weekends with the kinds of losers that are

85
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:19,718
attracted to that type of hobby.

86
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,457
Maybe there's a better way instead of trying
to turn normal citizens into firemen?

87
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:29,128
How about trying to turn a normal car into a
fire truck?

88
00:05:29,728 --> 00:05:34,400
Aren't we all thrilled to see a fire truck
roaring down the street, whipping by you on

89
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,568
the way to a blaze that you never started on
purpose?

90
00:05:36,935 --> 00:05:38,370
I mean, wasn't my fault.

91
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,073
I think electrical appliances have got to
have better warnings on them.

92
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:49,982
Yeah. Ok, now first thing in any fire trucks
going to have is an axe, a shovel and a pick.

93
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,754
All right now in a fire truck, I have all
this stuff on the other side so the

94
00:05:55,754 --> 00:05:59,425
firefighters can get to it in emergency
like, say, a fire.

95
00:05:59,725 --> 00:06:00,993
Well, we can do the same thing.

96
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:05,297
What you want to do is take a drill and
drill holes in your trunk larger than the

97
00:06:05,297 --> 00:06:08,433
diameter of the handles. Then they'll be
sticking right out there for you to get away.

98
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:18,043
Let's start drilling. And don't worry about
any damage here, anything goes, we're going

99
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:20,045
to beat this whole baby fire engine red.

100
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,996
Perfect. Now you notice how the fire trucks
have lots of flashing lights.

101
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:39,264
Well, so do you.

102
00:06:39,898 --> 00:06:42,301
They're all hanging on your eavesdrop
because you never took them down.

103
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:47,039
Right? Well, go pull them down and hook them
up with an extension cord because any fire

104
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,309
that's farther away than the length of my
extension cord is probably none of my

105
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:55,347
business. All right now you want to hook
them on there, or you could use metal clips

106
00:06:55,347 --> 00:06:59,184
on that or any of the plastic fasteners or,
of course, the handy man secret weapon

107
00:06:59,184 --> 00:07:00,986
duct tape.

108
00:07:00,986 --> 00:07:07,960
All right now, fire trucks have
sirens, and of course, your horn is a good

109
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,797
start there. But I'll tell you for that
little extra noise, what you want to do is

110
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:18,170
loosen off your alternator belt and your fan
belt and your power steering just a little

111
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:23,542
bit. Then when you start it up, everybody
will hear you coming.

112
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,245
Fact even punch a few holes in the muffler
if you want.

113
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,214
Now everybody knows it.

114
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:30,816
Fire trucks have hoses.

115
00:07:31,316 --> 00:07:35,520
So what you can do? Get yourself a bunch of
these hoses on rails like this and get about

116
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,357
the hardware store. Or you can just borrow
on somebody when they're not around.

117
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:44,429
Attach them on here with bolts or weld them
right on there or.

118
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,500
That's right. And don't worry if they don't
match because we're going to paint this whole

119
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,001
thing a beautiful fire engine red.

120
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:56,208
I want to take one end of your hoses and
hook them right into your water pump so you

121
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,776
don't just have a fire truck here.

122
00:07:58,009 --> 00:07:59,277
You got a pumper truck.

123
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:06,351
Of course, every fire truck has to have a
ladder, a ladder that will go in any

124
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:11,990
direction because fire happens in any
direction and you may park in any direction.

125
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:16,561
So what you need for that is some kind of a
rotating platform with an axle down through

126
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:19,531
the center of it. Easy to do.

127
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:23,935
You want to make sure nobody's sitting in
the car when you do this.

128
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:29,107
And there we got a ladder where you can
fight fires in two directions at the same

129
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:34,412
time. And she goes up and down just like the
units do on the real fire trucks and at a

130
00:08:34,412 --> 00:08:35,580
fraction of the cost.

131
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:39,050
All right, a couple of final details here.

132
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,987
You want to get some buckets of sand here
hanging off the front, a little bit of water

133
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:46,958
here and you got your emergency oxygen unit
here because you want to empty the propane

134
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,860
out of that, put the oxygen in.

135
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:51,730
I'm not quite sure how you do that, but I'm
guessing it's important.

136
00:08:52,897 --> 00:08:55,867
You got your smoke detectors on here and let
you know when you're getting real close to

137
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:57,936
the fire. So we're basically ready for any
arsonist.

138
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,906
I'm not sure what an arsonist is, but it
sounds like the kind of thing we have plenty

139
00:09:01,906 --> 00:09:03,241
of up here at the Lodge.

140
00:09:04,142 --> 00:09:05,276
Oh my gosh, a fire.

141
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,079
All right. Like in our lives here.

142
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:13,952
And they shot better to make fire and away
we go.

143
00:09:24,295 --> 00:09:28,967
Maybe I shouldn't have disconnected the
water pump fire.

144
00:09:47,652 --> 00:09:51,156
Remember, women don't find it handsome, they
should at least find your handy.

145
00:09:51,656 --> 00:09:53,324
And don't worry about the black color here.

146
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:55,693
I'm going to paint the whole thing a
beautiful fire engine red.

147
00:09:58,196 --> 00:10:01,499
Yup, she’s out.

148
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:04,302
Stay tuned and relax whatever this is
we got lots more of it.

149
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:15,146
I want to talk to you, ladies, to help you
understand why we men do some of the things

150
00:10:15,146 --> 00:10:21,853
we do like, for example, how we fix
everything with duct tape like, say, putting

151
00:10:21,853 --> 00:10:23,421
the mirror back on the car.

152
00:10:25,056 --> 00:10:29,360
Now, a lot of people would take the car to a
garage and an hour and 60 bucks later, it

153
00:10:29,394 --> 00:10:31,462
would be fixed properly and look real good.

154
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:36,301
Whereas your handyman takes 10 minutes and
seven cents worth of duct tape and it looks

155
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:42,073
butt-ugly. But let's take a look at the
reasoning behind the actions.

156
00:10:42,106 --> 00:10:43,641
What car are we talking about here?

157
00:10:43,841 --> 00:10:49,948
Is this an 81 Cordoba with four hundred
thousand miles on it and a real bad cough?

158
00:10:51,015 --> 00:10:54,285
Why would you spend 60 bucks on a car that
you can replace for 50?

159
00:10:56,421 --> 00:10:59,590
And why take an hour to fix something that
can be done in 10 minutes?

160
00:10:59,757 --> 00:11:04,228
If you put four hundred thousand miles on
her, you don't owe it any more of your time.

161
00:11:05,763 --> 00:11:07,332
And what's the big deal about fixing
something?

162
00:11:07,732 --> 00:11:11,969
Putting the right back into original quality
just makes the rest of the car look bad.

163
00:11:13,104 --> 00:11:15,673
Nothing worse than a repair job that outlast
the vehicle.

164
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:21,345
So I would suggest that you ladies, instead
of criticizing your husband for slapping on

165
00:11:21,345 --> 00:11:24,348
the duct tape, why don't you compliment him
for his brainpower?

166
00:11:25,116 --> 00:11:29,921
Realize this. He now has 50 minutes on his
hands and an extra 60 bucks in his pocket.

167
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:33,491
Remember, I'm pulling for you.

168
00:11:33,591 --> 00:11:34,759
We're all in this together.

169
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:41,265
Ok, so old man, Sedgwick Son has moved back
in with him, and you can tell by the broken

170
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:45,636
furniture out on the front lawn and the duct
tape that got divided in the rooms exactly in

171
00:11:45,636 --> 00:11:48,473
half that things are really not going all
that well.

172
00:11:48,506 --> 00:11:51,709
Now you tell me, what is the worst thing
that could happen out of that scenario?

173
00:11:51,742 --> 00:11:52,109
Well, they

174
00:11:52,109 --> 00:11:54,745
Could be heating their cabin with a high
sulfur coal.

175
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:57,582
And then meanwhile, on top of the wood
stove, both men are rinsing their teeth in

176
00:11:57,582 --> 00:11:58,850
the same pewter jar, right?

177
00:11:58,883 --> 00:12:01,118
And that would create the symbiotic
hydrolysis, right?

178
00:12:01,118 --> 00:12:02,620
And then there'd be a thermal inversion,
right?

179
00:12:02,854 --> 00:12:06,257
And then all of sudden, the sulfur ions that
have to collide with the dental plaque,

180
00:12:06,257 --> 00:12:08,359
right? Not an accelerate the electron to the
point.

181
00:12:08,726 --> 00:12:10,695
Would it be this massive nuclear reaction?

182
00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:15,433
It wouldn't kill him. Oh, no, it wouldn't
kill them, Uncle Brad, but enthusiastic

183
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:18,469
wouldn't render them absolutely sterile for
the rest of their lives.

184
00:12:31,148 --> 00:12:33,050
I'm writing an episode of The Outer Limits.

185
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,187
Harold, you are an episode of The Outer
Limits.

186
00:12:37,888 --> 00:12:41,626
No, the worst thing that could happen is, Oh
man, Cedric's not getting along with his son,

187
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:44,729
so he's moved out of his cabin and he's
moving into the lodge.

188
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:45,963
What? Yeah, no.

189
00:12:45,997 --> 00:12:46,664
Yeah. Oh no.

190
00:12:46,664 --> 00:12:49,200
How can we do that? This is like one hundred
and twenty five year old lodge.

191
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,901
He has to have the permission of the
membership, right?

192
00:12:50,935 --> 00:12:52,069
No, not all, man says.

193
00:12:52,236 --> 00:12:54,372
He said it was part of the deal when he
helped build the place.

194
00:12:55,172 --> 00:12:56,374
This is awful. This is terrible.

195
00:12:56,407 --> 00:12:59,643
You got to do something, uncle. I'm
surprised you're taking this the way you are.

196
00:13:00,077 --> 00:13:01,679
Well, he's not staying in my room.

197
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:10,955
A poem by Dylan Thomas Greene, the force
sent through the green fuse, drives the

198
00:13:10,955 --> 00:13:17,528
flower, drives my green age that blasts the
roots of trees is my destroyer.

199
00:13:17,828 --> 00:13:22,299
But this forest cannot wreak the damage of a
six pack in a bucket of curly fries.

200
00:13:34,712 --> 00:13:38,082
Plus, a nine one one, thanks for calling
state your membership card number

201
00:13:39,683 --> 00:13:42,820
Seven six five three four eight.

202
00:13:43,821 --> 00:13:44,989
That's Ducky Franklin's number one.

203
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:46,290
What's the trouble there, Dougie? Great.

204
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:49,260
I'm all alone house.

205
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,928
Well, this sounds serious.

206
00:13:51,896 --> 00:13:53,264
You roll the monster truck there, Dougie.

207
00:13:53,264 --> 00:13:54,298
You pinned in the cab again.

208
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,903
It's my mom. She's she's out of town for a
week, Brad.

209
00:14:01,238 --> 00:14:02,439
His mom's out of town for a week.

210
00:14:02,506 --> 00:14:03,474
I don't get it.

211
00:14:03,474 --> 00:14:06,777
I do. Harold, when's the last time
you ate proper food, Dougie?

212
00:14:07,678 --> 00:14:12,116
I don't know how good snacks.

213
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,618
I ate a jar of olives, Red.

214
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,923
Ok, Dougie, what room are you in right now?

215
00:14:20,024 --> 00:14:23,227
I don't know. I don't recognize a thing.

216
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:25,562
All right, Dougie. That'll be the kitchen.

217
00:14:27,231 --> 00:14:30,968
You want to go to the
cupboard that has all the cooking supplies in

218
00:14:30,968 --> 00:14:31,835
it, the what?

219
00:14:32,236 --> 00:14:33,037
The cupboard?

220
00:14:33,337 --> 00:14:34,038
What's that?

221
00:14:35,472 --> 00:14:38,776
It's like the stove or the dishwasher without
all the controls.

222
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:42,046
What's that? Well, it's like the washing
machine or the clothes dryer.

223
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:42,513
Oh, for

224
00:14:42,513 --> 00:14:44,748
Pete's sake, speak English, will you?

225
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:48,585
All right, Dougie, where do you keep your beer?

226
00:14:48,619 --> 00:14:49,353
Oh, the fridge.

227
00:14:49,353 --> 00:14:50,087
Yeah.

228
00:14:51,188 --> 00:14:54,425
Red, everything's going dark.

229
00:14:54,425 --> 00:14:55,626
Now, now take it easy, Dougie.

230
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:56,727
This is Red speaking to you.

231
00:14:57,161 --> 00:14:58,295
Look on the fridge door.

232
00:14:58,595 --> 00:15:00,330
Yeah, see a lot of magnets there.

233
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,498
Yeah, huh?

234
00:15:01,532 --> 00:15:02,599
Paper Yeah.

235
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,035
Pieces Smurfs.

236
00:15:05,803 --> 00:15:07,071
Oh, OK.

237
00:15:07,104 --> 00:15:09,106
And one of those is going to have a phone
number on it.

238
00:15:09,473 --> 00:15:11,308
Yeah, you want to call that number?

239
00:15:11,341 --> 00:15:13,343
Crawl over to the door and wait in half an
hour.

240
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:14,311
You'll have a pizza.

241
00:15:14,478 --> 00:15:15,913
Oh, thank you, Red.

242
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:19,082
I can't believe my own mother would try to
kill me.

243
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:26,056
Well, here we are back with adventures, with
Bill, we've been practicing all the time, we

244
00:15:26,056 --> 00:15:27,758
were away and we got some real special
stuff.

245
00:15:28,225 --> 00:15:33,163
And I thought I wouldn't enjoy this, but what Bill
is going to do is try to create a plan and

246
00:15:33,163 --> 00:15:34,665
that chair on top of the shed there.

247
00:15:34,665 --> 00:15:40,337
And I just, you know, suddenly, you know,
attitude is so much, so much a part of life.

248
00:15:40,337 --> 00:15:43,540
And I'm thinking, Oh my gosh, you know, I
just go with it and have some fun with it,

249
00:15:43,574 --> 00:15:51,014
you know, jump on the board and let go and
just, you know, we go, we go, Oh boy, I love

250
00:15:51,014 --> 00:15:52,883
a circus, you know? Gosh, my gosh.

251
00:15:53,183 --> 00:15:56,620
All right. Little change. A plan now is
going to actually start in the chair and then

252
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,522
flip the both of them up onto the roof that
way.

253
00:15:58,755 --> 00:16:00,490
That sounds very sensible to me.

254
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:06,964
And yes, going, oh my gosh, seem to have
gone horribly wrong.

255
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:13,103
Oh well, I'll just take it out of the way
and just clean up a little bit.

256
00:16:14,671 --> 00:16:16,039
Oh, there's a chair I can just

257
00:16:16,506 --> 00:16:18,575
I'll just relax for a second and wait for a
bill.

258
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,177
I'm sure they'll be here shortly.

259
00:16:22,245 --> 00:16:23,046
There he is now.

260
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:24,781
I'll tell you one thing about Bill.

261
00:16:24,815 --> 00:16:27,017
He never, ever hurts himself.

262
00:16:28,885 --> 00:16:29,653
Hardly, ever.

263
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,491
Here's a duct tape dispenser that fits right
on your belt sent to us by a viewer

264
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,729
I hold your horses.

265
00:16:41,231 --> 00:16:45,001
Old man Cedric. Bedridden. Which is a
normal thing for the lodge, but he's actually

266
00:16:45,001 --> 00:16:49,740
not feeling well. Well, he's got the bunch
of us running around getting some lemon,

267
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,110
herbal, chamomile tea and rubber things with
fluid in them.

268
00:16:54,344 --> 00:16:58,849
And, of course, the Sports Illustrated
Swimsuit Edition and his latest request is

269
00:16:58,849 --> 00:17:00,350
for half a dozen bran muffins here.

270
00:17:01,418 --> 00:17:02,052
Yeah, yeah.

271
00:17:02,219 --> 00:17:03,553
Harold’s just getting a plate.

272
00:17:04,688 --> 00:17:04,921
Yeah.

273
00:17:14,564 --> 00:17:18,268
Uncle Red, I couldn't find a clean plate
anywhere, so I just stole the hubcap off the

274
00:17:18,268 --> 00:17:22,372
possum van. Oh baby, it’s really
stuck on there too.

275
00:17:22,372 --> 00:17:24,841
You shouldn’t have taken
the one off the driver's side front.

276
00:17:24,941 --> 00:17:26,309
If I have that tire off every couple of
weeks.

277
00:17:26,877 --> 00:17:27,811
Well, why is that?

278
00:17:28,545 --> 00:17:29,746
That's the wheel I hit stuff with.

279
00:17:31,381 --> 00:17:33,149
Anyway, take these up to Old Man Cedric

280
00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:35,252
Good enough.

281
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:39,623
Not too polite taking muffins up
in a hubcap, is it?

282
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:41,525
No, I was going to serve them in a
bedpan.

283
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:45,962
Skip the middleman. And you tell him if he
eats all them up, you can come down and get

284
00:17:45,962 --> 00:17:46,530
them some more.

285
00:17:46,763 --> 00:17:48,365
Well, he eats all these up.

286
00:17:48,398 --> 00:17:49,599
I'm not going anywhere near him.

287
00:17:51,935 --> 00:17:55,105
Welcome to the expert portion of the show
where we examine those three little words

288
00:17:55,105 --> 00:17:57,340
that men find so hard to say.

289
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,576
(audience) I don’t know

290
00:18:01,011 --> 00:18:04,147
Ok, excellent. And joining me and Red now on
the expert portion of the show this week is his

291
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:07,550
best friend in the whole wide room, local
roofer Arnie Dogan.

292
00:18:12,355 --> 00:18:14,224
Today's letter goes as follows:

293
00:18:14,557 --> 00:18:16,426
Dear experts,

294
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:21,031
I enjoy extreme sports like shark wrestling
and taking the last doughnut at bingo.

295
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:25,635
But my girlfriend is afraid I'll kill myself
in a way that will void my car insurance and

296
00:18:25,635 --> 00:18:27,370
my life insurance and my dental plan.

297
00:18:27,404 --> 00:18:30,206
I love taking risks, but I don't want to
lose her.

298
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,441
What should I do?

299
00:18:31,975 --> 00:18:33,877
Well bud, I would go with the girlfriend on
this one.

300
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,779
I'll tell you right now, you know, life is
short enough.

301
00:18:35,812 --> 00:18:38,081
You don't want to be accelerating the
process in any way.

302
00:18:38,381 --> 00:18:40,984
Oh, sorry, Red. I don't see it that way.

303
00:18:41,017 --> 00:18:42,719
You got to take chances.

304
00:18:43,186 --> 00:18:47,057
I mean, like we say in the roof, in
business, if you don't go to the edge, she's

305
00:18:47,057 --> 00:18:47,991
going to leak,

306
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,392
All right.

307
00:18:49,526 --> 00:18:51,561
And then you'll end up with ice buildup.

308
00:18:52,695 --> 00:18:53,963
Ok, that’s uh...

309
00:18:53,963 --> 00:18:55,598
And it'll sag and smell funny.

310
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,702
I mean, if I didn't take chances, I wouldn't
be sitting here today.

311
00:19:00,236 --> 00:19:01,871
Oh, that's right, Arnie. You'd be at work.

312
00:19:03,473 --> 00:19:08,144
Oh, you mean this? No. I'll be back at work
soon as a cast off and they removed that.

313
00:19:08,144 --> 00:19:10,180
That extra foot of eavesdropping.

314
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:18,221
I can't believe you're going back to
roofing, Mr Dogan, after that accident.

315
00:19:18,454 --> 00:19:19,956
Oh, roofing is in my blood,

316
00:19:19,956 --> 00:19:21,391
Harold, and vice versa.

317
00:19:23,326 --> 00:19:27,564
Stuff happens. They read, my dad was a roofer
and so was his dad.

318
00:19:27,864 --> 00:19:31,801
Grandpa Dogan started Dogan and Son's
Roofing back in 1938, when

319
00:19:31,801 --> 00:19:35,538
some woman's husband come home early for
some grandpa to slide out her bedroom window

320
00:19:35,538 --> 00:19:36,839
and pretend he was replacing shingles.

321
00:19:38,675 --> 00:19:40,577
Wow! Can't be much of a business.

322
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:43,279
You spent more on medical care than you ever
made on roofing.

323
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:45,915
Yeah, well, you got to have something on the
side, right?

324
00:19:45,915 --> 00:19:48,384
Yeah. You know, my grandpa always had
something on the side.

325
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:51,654
So do I. Country music?

326
00:19:51,854 --> 00:19:53,423
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's right.

327
00:19:53,423 --> 00:19:55,825
I've written over seventeen thousand songs,

328
00:19:56,659 --> 00:19:59,028
You know, really, I think we should just
concentrate on answering this letter about

329
00:19:59,028 --> 00:20:00,029
extreme sports.

330
00:20:00,063 --> 00:20:01,597
Well, that's what I'm doing. You think so?

331
00:20:01,597 --> 00:20:04,467
I'm saying. Pursue your dreams.

332
00:20:04,734 --> 00:20:08,304
If I didn't pursue my dreams, Harold, how
could I have written this?

333
00:20:18,214 --> 00:20:19,482
All right. Yeah.

334
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:27,824
I loved her on the rooftop, but she didn't
like my flashing.

335
00:20:30,326 --> 00:20:37,500
She threw my heart in the downspouts and now
I drink a lot.

336
00:20:38,434 --> 00:20:40,436
And drive trucks.

337
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,012
I wrote that one last week in the recovery
room.

338
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:53,382
Well, next time away from the anesthetic to
wear off, you know, every once in a while, I

339
00:20:55,718 --> 00:20:57,653
You know, every once in a while,

340
00:20:57,653 --> 00:20:59,388
I come up with an idea that makes just so much
sense.

341
00:20:59,922 --> 00:21:00,990
It's irresistible.

342
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,225
You're quitting television.

343
00:21:05,228 --> 00:21:07,263
Did I say that out loud?

344
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:12,468
I'm talking about old man Cedric.

345
00:21:12,468 --> 00:21:16,205
We had him laid up here in the lodge and got
a son living in his cabin didn't want any

346
00:21:16,205 --> 00:21:20,743
part of him. So I'm thinking to myself, Hey,
who are the most obvious people to look after

347
00:21:20,743 --> 00:21:21,477
old man Cedric?

348
00:21:21,477 --> 00:21:25,314
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I
know who it is, who the Victorian order of

349
00:21:25,381 --> 00:21:26,048
Who?

350
00:21:26,048 --> 00:21:27,049
The Victorian order of nurses.

351
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:28,851
Yeah, that'd be great because
they're all well trained.

352
00:21:28,851 --> 00:21:30,786
They're all very personal. They've got their
own cars.

353
00:21:30,786 --> 00:21:33,489
They've got these really cool crafts right
there in the door, right in the door.

354
00:21:33,489 --> 00:21:35,224
And they're all ladies.

355
00:21:36,692 --> 00:21:38,327
He might even meet somebody who can meet
somebody.

356
00:21:38,961 --> 00:21:40,596
No, Harold. No, no.

357
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,798
I'm talking about Old Man Cedric’s
parents.

358
00:21:43,466 --> 00:21:46,936
I think his mother's name is Old
Lady Cedrick

359
00:21:46,936 --> 00:21:49,005
and his dad is ‘Dead Man Walking Cedric’.

360
00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:52,808
He's got parents, and they're still alive?

361
00:21:52,808 --> 00:21:53,609
How old are they?

362
00:21:53,643 --> 00:21:54,777
Well, they're they're old.

363
00:21:54,877 --> 00:21:56,779
She has a tattoo, says George Washington.

364
00:21:56,779 --> 00:22:01,150
Slept here, but you know, I talked to them.

365
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:04,120
I had to yell, but I did talk to them and
they weren't interested in doing it.

366
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,356
So I went back to his son and I said, Hey,
listen, you know, you've got to look after

367
00:22:07,356 --> 00:22:08,791
your old man who is an old man.

368
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,393
In fact, his name is even old man.

369
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,497
And the thought of that much responsibility
scared him so bad.

370
00:22:14,664 --> 00:22:16,599
He took off, went back where he came from.

371
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:17,733
So everybody wins.

372
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:20,569
Like, Oh man, Cedric is moving back to
his cabin.

373
00:22:20,569 --> 00:22:22,038
Absolutely, that means I get my room back
right.

374
00:22:22,471 --> 00:22:23,739
Oh, excellent.

375
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:28,978
Yeah. You know, Harold, you might want to
wait till the bed dries.

376
00:22:31,781 --> 00:22:32,648
That's a good point.

377
00:22:32,648 --> 00:22:33,516
Meeting time. Meeting time.

378
00:22:34,016 --> 00:22:34,683
Sound of the possum.

379
00:22:35,117 --> 00:22:36,018
You go ahead, Harold.

380
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:37,620
I'll be down in a minute.

381
00:22:38,687 --> 00:22:41,223
My wife is watching. I'll be coming straight
home after the meeting.

382
00:22:41,223 --> 00:22:43,959
And you know all this talk old man says
you're going to son and everything.

383
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,529
That kind of thing about maybe having a son
of our own.

384
00:22:46,529 --> 00:22:49,832
But then I take a look at Harold and the
whole idea just...

385
00:22:49,832 --> 00:22:52,768
Thanks for watching on behalf of myself

386
00:22:52,768 --> 00:22:55,604
and Harold and the whole gang out here
at Possum Lodge

387
00:22:55,604 --> 00:22:58,073
Keep your stick on the ice.
