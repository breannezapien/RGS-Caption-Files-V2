1
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,177
And now it's time to prove that men do not
lead lives of quiet desperation.

2
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:45,712
No way they're loud.

3
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:48,681
And when you think of loud men, don't you
think of the men of Possum Lodge?

4
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:53,253
Generally, I know my uncle in particular
because he's the leader of the Possum Lodge,

5
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:57,056
and that's the only because, you know,
discouraging lack of turnout on Election Day.

6
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,160
But anyway, here's the star of the Red Green
Show, and that's due mainly to the fact that,

7
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,228
you know, he has the same name.

8
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:03,663
Anyway, here he is. Mr.

9
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:05,031
Red. Green.

10
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:11,371
Thank you, Harold. Thank you and welcome to
Possum Lodge.

11
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:15,241
Please don't judge the show by anything
Harold ever says or does.

12
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,945
He's only my producer and director because
first of all, he's my nephew.

13
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:22,715
And secondly, this is black fly country,
which really teaches you to put up with just

14
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:23,416
about anything.

15
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,419
And I'm here to put juice into the show like
this.

16
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:32,025
We have to watch a half hour of that.

17
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:35,695
Things are really hopping up at the Lodge
this week.

18
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:40,033
Eddie made a special stew, tasted like a
Hungarian goulash.

19
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,671
You know what? I think the problem is I think
Eddie doesn't concentrate on when he cooks.

20
00:01:45,204 --> 00:01:46,606
Well, that's it in a nutshell, Harold.

21
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:50,710
And from a nutshell, know Eddie's mind is
somewhere else.

22
00:01:50,943 --> 00:01:53,446
Yeah. Broadway. He wants to sing on Broadway.

23
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,349
Well, no, no. I think it's more like
off-Broadway, isn't he?

24
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:58,618
I mean it when he sings, it sounds off.

25
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,653
I mean, it's way off Broadway.

26
00:02:00,686 --> 00:02:01,721
Like, maybe the Yukon.

27
00:02:02,588 --> 00:02:04,223
I think we just get on to the next segment.

28
00:02:04,223 --> 00:02:08,761
I'll remember that pacing thing we talked
about at the last production meeting.

29
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,966
Yeah. Ok. So anyway, a bunch of the guys, you
know, managed to have a word with Eddie, you

30
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:15,468
know, once the Cale Peck had kicked in.

31
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:20,072
You're kind of rough on especially Moose
Thompson, because Moose said he'd had a whole

32
00:02:20,072 --> 00:02:22,008
bag full of stew and the thing was moose.

33
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,009
He said he eats it darn fast.

34
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:25,578
He really doesn't taste anything until he's
into the third plateful.

35
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:27,713
We're going,

36
00:02:28,614 --> 00:02:32,418
Yeah, so once Mohsin finished, you know,
talking to Eddie about his physical

37
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:36,422
appearance, his religious preference and his
ethnic background, and he has decided to

38
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,459
really back off on the cooking and focus his
full attention onto his showbiz career.

39
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:44,764
We're going, yeah, I'm I'm done here.

40
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:45,331
Go ahead.

41
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,400
Oh, oh, oh, OK.

42
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,903
All right. All right. Then do nothing.

43
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:54,440
Ok, what is that? Larry, Larry is my man.

44
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,776
Well, up there in the booth. Whoa, that's
loud.

45
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:57,610
Loud.

46
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:06,886
Ariel. Ok, attach air

47
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:13,559
Raid siren to truck alternator, check, let's
see oh, and then plug unit in.

48
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:17,730
All right, Bill. You plug it in and I'll
pump up the volume.

49
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:20,967
Air raid siren What?

50
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:24,270
What is this thing, Andy? This is a karaoke
machine, Harold.

51
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:29,275
You see, you put the the tape with just the
music on it in here and then you sing along.

52
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:30,843
Very big in Japan.

53
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,012
Wow, that's surprising.

54
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:36,148
You mean the Japanese workers are singing
songs in the factories and they're making all

55
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:41,520
those camcorders? The Japanese are very
powerful in the business and there's no

56
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,789
business like show business, and that's my
business.

57
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:47,126
And now I've got a machine that's going to
hone my skills.

58
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,327
Oh, you can cook on it.

59
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:54,366
I'm going to be on Broadway, Harold, and you
are not going to rain on my parade.

60
00:03:55,434 --> 00:03:57,470
I'm going to be the next Bobby.

61
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,005
Then I just think I stay here ready.

62
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,343
I got a real deal for Murray, so he makes
them in his basement.

63
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,112
Wait, do you hear the sound on this thing?

64
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:10,883
Red? Ok, bill, there's a plug over there
behind the stove.

65
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:11,417
You want to get it?

66
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,965
There's a light show to

67
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,402
Doc Render Thank Eddie took a big jolt there.

68
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,872
Why was he standing in water?

69
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:39,078
No, but I am. Hey, Eddie, we got that song
book list for you.

70
00:04:39,678 --> 00:04:41,981
What's the matter with him singing falsetto?

71
00:04:43,215 --> 00:04:46,418
No way. He just got some feedback from your
kamikaze machine there.

72
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:51,724
We brought you the soundtracks to funny girl
Annie, Get your gun and South Pacific.

73
00:04:51,757 --> 00:04:54,894
Except for, I'm going to wash that man right
out of my hair.

74
00:04:55,494 --> 00:04:57,096
Mary and I didn't think you wanted that one
anyway.

75
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:01,133
Well, you don't have to decide right now.

76
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,235
Better coming from the rain might be a
goner.

77
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,706
Or This is version of Silent Night.

78
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:13,279
Silent Night. Well, those shoes on.

79
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:14,480
I guess I'll discharge them.

80
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:16,582
Bill, you want a ground that on the stove?

81
00:05:19,885 --> 00:05:23,422
You know, a touch more wire, we could use
them to jumpstart the lawn tractor out back.

82
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:31,030
All right. Let her rip cry for me,
Argentina.

83
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:37,102
You carry OK me.

84
00:05:39,271 --> 00:05:41,106
Hey, big spender.

85
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:45,511
I'm standing right there and all of a
sudden.

86
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,748
Seventy six trombones led the big parade.

87
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:53,952
I got this incredible shot, huh?

88
00:05:54,753 --> 00:05:57,022
Well, maybe you hooked it up wrong?

89
00:05:57,589 --> 00:06:00,359
I didn't hook it up from you.

90
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:04,797
How heard you solve a problem like Maria?

91
00:06:06,832 --> 00:06:11,103
You built it wrong, and you are just darn
lucky that I wasn't hurt.

92
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:17,810
Or when you reject you, reject and suffered
permanent damage.

93
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,845
Are you feeling OK, Eddie?

94
00:06:20,512 --> 00:06:23,115
Yes, right? I'm fine name.

95
00:06:26,585 --> 00:06:27,853
Very unusual read.

96
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:29,688
Entertaining as hell, though.

97
00:06:30,322 --> 00:06:32,624
I'm just lucky there wasn't the polka tape
on that damn machine.

98
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:36,828
Well, Mary, I think you better give Eddie his
money back here.

99
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:39,131
Hey, no, no way.

100
00:06:39,464 --> 00:06:47,606
I and I could have danced all night, but I
don't want my money back.

101
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,175
I just I just want this machine fixed.

102
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:52,010
I need it for my career.

103
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:56,748
I think cash refund is enough of a long shot.

104
00:06:58,016 --> 00:07:01,620
Well, see, it wasn't my money.

105
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:07,359
Give it to the soul to make money.

106
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:11,330
I kind of borrowed it from the The Lodge
Entertainment Fund.

107
00:07:12,864 --> 00:07:14,399
You guys better work this out between you.

108
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:19,071
But whatever you come up with, it's got to
be entertaining or profitable or kill one of

109
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:19,271
you.

110
00:07:21,873 --> 00:07:24,276
You know, with that electric shock thing
there, Eddie, I thought it was really

111
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:27,145
entertaining. You know what? Maybe we could
just like, sell this to Alice Cooper?

112
00:07:27,212 --> 00:07:29,014
Well, well, maybe so.

113
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:30,816
But she better not touch it till it's fixed.

114
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:35,854
Chicago, Chicago.

115
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:37,155
It's my go to town.

116
00:07:37,322 --> 00:07:38,423
It's my kind of town.

117
00:07:41,693 --> 00:07:42,260
What?

118
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:50,335
Don't stick your face in

119
00:07:50,335 --> 00:07:51,670
A hollow log.

120
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:59,778
Don't squat on your haunches and a toxic
ball, go by face up in a cattle field.

121
00:08:00,645 --> 00:08:04,382
And don't ever date a woman named Crusher.

122
00:08:09,988 --> 00:08:15,360
This week, handyman gardener, when I show you
how to do some proof on your car.

123
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:21,099
You know, these days with the government
putting so much salt on the roads, you know,

124
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:24,469
they end up retaining water and your car
rests out on you.

125
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:29,007
So you end up having to do some body work or
some some sort of a defensive mechanism.

126
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:33,778
A lot of people use a fiberglass, but the
fiberglass on the car, but that's hard to do,

127
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:37,515
and it's expensive. Smells funny, and you
can't even put a fridge magnet and leave a

128
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:38,917
message for anybody on your car after that.

129
00:08:40,151 --> 00:08:45,257
Now, most Thompson, what he done was he
completely encased his truck in cement, which

130
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:48,360
was a kind of a novel approach that really
cut into his gas mileage.

131
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,229
But if he's ever in an accident, he wins.

132
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:54,532
I want to take kind of a kind of a new
approach.

133
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,267
I want you to think about this.

134
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:02,173
Linoleum put some linoleum spray on your
car.

135
00:09:02,774 --> 00:09:06,945
It's fairly inexpensive, it's lightweight,
it's durable, and if you get into a fender

136
00:09:06,945 --> 00:09:10,048
bender, you know, if you've got a decent
cushion floor on there could save your life.

137
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:15,553
What you do is take her out and cut her out
and roughly the shape of the car.

138
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:22,160
Stick it on with the handyman secret weapon
duct tape that doesn't take care three or

139
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,964
four hours on a on a Saturday or or really
any any day.

140
00:09:25,997 --> 00:09:31,202
I mean, that part's up to you, but I think
you'd be quite surprised and to a certain

141
00:09:31,202 --> 00:09:33,538
extent, amazed at how it turns out.

142
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:41,413
I'm kind of on a limited budget, so I did
this all with with the samples.

143
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:45,984
But I suppose if the money is in Heidrich,
you would get, you know, the whole roll of

144
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,087
linoleum in nine by 12 or whatever comes in
and do it all.

145
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:53,358
Actually, I kind of like this look, and I'm
sure there's people out there, maybe yuppies

146
00:09:53,358 --> 00:09:57,829
or what have you that would that would want
to do it all in parquet or teraz or tile of

147
00:09:57,829 --> 00:10:00,331
some kind. But this is just fine for me.

148
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:06,304
It's easy as heck to keep clean too, because
it's a no wax finish it just a damp mop that

149
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:08,773
down, especially if there's eggs or what
have you on.

150
00:10:08,773 --> 00:10:10,875
It comes right up. Let's grab it myself.

151
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:14,145
First thing I'm going to I'm going to polish
this up, but that's just a that's a pride

152
00:10:14,145 --> 00:10:16,181
thing. That's just something that I have.

153
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:20,418
But if you want to do this with anything,
it's the same technique.

154
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:23,521
As long as you got the duct tape in the
time, you can have something that looks like

155
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:24,589
this sitting in your driveway.

156
00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:29,060
So until next time, remember the women don't
find you handsome, they should at least find

157
00:10:29,093 --> 00:10:32,297
a handy, beautiful, beautiful thing.

158
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:32,730
Is it not?

159
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:53,751
It is autumn. One last ride in the boat.

160
00:10:53,951 --> 00:10:55,620
One last day at the cottage.

161
00:10:55,753 --> 00:11:00,758
One last drive in the car through the hills
and then the repo man takes it all away.

162
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:12,570
So anyway, Eddie, the Cook wants us to keep
that karaoke machine since it was bought with

163
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,773
large money, but you know, it's awful hard
to follow the argument when he keeps breaking

164
00:11:15,773 --> 00:11:17,141
into Rodgers and Hammerstein.

165
00:11:17,942 --> 00:11:22,280
I can understand. Good value for the money,
but I am 16, going on 17.

166
00:11:23,114 --> 00:11:26,551
Anyway, the bunch of us went down to Murray
Star to try to get a refund.

167
00:11:26,884 --> 00:11:30,721
We don't know whether to use brute force or
perhaps something more subtle like, say,

168
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:32,390
closing all the windows and getting stinky.

169
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,791
Peterson negotiate a settlement,

170
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:37,795
Getting off the red Duane and Murray to both
lodge members.

171
00:11:37,795 --> 00:11:38,729
You know, I really can't see

172
00:11:38,729 --> 00:11:41,299
Them intentionally ripping other members off.

173
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,201
Well, no, no, I agree with that.

174
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:44,769
But you know, just to be on the safe side.

175
00:11:44,902 --> 00:11:48,372
Mouse and helmet took down a couple of
pickaxes in a Zamboni delegate.

176
00:11:48,372 --> 00:11:49,373
Murray's attention, you know,

177
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:52,210
All a minute, that's violence normal.

178
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,379
That's using violence as a tool, and I
cannot adhere to violence in any form.

179
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,816
Well, hang on, if I had your personality, I'd
be against violence myself.

180
00:11:59,317 --> 00:12:00,151
Yeah, exactly.

181
00:12:00,685 --> 00:12:02,854
And I'll bet you that violence didn't get you
anywhere, either, did it?

182
00:12:03,621 --> 00:12:06,824
Well, sort of did. Well, Murray gave you your
money back.

183
00:12:07,592 --> 00:12:11,162
Not yet, but I'll tell you, we got an
unbelievable price on work socks.

184
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,531
Oh, OK.

185
00:12:13,564 --> 00:12:15,466
Oh, OK. All right. Oh yeah.

186
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:17,235
Good deal. Way to go. Good work there, Uncle
Ray.

187
00:12:17,702 --> 00:12:19,604
Oh hey, babe.

188
00:12:19,637 --> 00:12:22,139
We may have to go to binding arbitration to
settle this thing.

189
00:12:23,174 --> 00:12:23,908
What's that?

190
00:12:24,508 --> 00:12:27,211
Well, that's where we tie Murray and Dwayne
into a chair and take their teeth out.

191
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:38,289
That's fair. Now, Doc, I really appreciate
what you did for

192
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:40,057
Eddie, there took a heck of a jolt, didn't
he?

193
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:43,361
Huh? I bet that shows up on this month
electric bill.

194
00:12:44,195 --> 00:12:46,497
Well, I've seen my share of vacations read
really?

195
00:12:47,264 --> 00:12:54,372
I'd say he didn't say he took a peak voltage
at 12 million amps of R C Wow.

196
00:12:54,438 --> 00:12:56,273
Not a curly hair left on his body.

197
00:12:58,009 --> 00:13:00,411
See, that seems like a lot of power.

198
00:13:00,978 --> 00:13:02,179
It seems a little high to me.

199
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:05,116
12 million something would not kill a man.

200
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:09,653
Well, no, no, no, not if you got both feet on
dry ground, right?

201
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,021
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

202
00:13:11,021 --> 00:13:16,727
As long as the the party are touching, the
ground is larger than the surface area of

203
00:13:16,727 --> 00:13:18,863
your own forehead. You're OK.

204
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,500
Yeah, yeah. I've run that when I was working
at the generating station.

205
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:25,035
Oh yeah, like electricity generating the
station.

206
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,204
Well, that's the only kind I ever heard of.

207
00:13:28,038 --> 00:13:29,039
Of course, I don't know everything.

208
00:13:30,207 --> 00:13:35,880
I'm kidding. Yeah, we were the biggest
generating station in the hemisphere.

209
00:13:36,113 --> 00:13:39,817
Yeah. Eighty six megawatts per day.

210
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,385
Wow. Yep. Wow.

211
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:48,526
You know, I remember at lunch time some of
the fellows and I we'd bungee jump off the

212
00:13:48,526 --> 00:13:54,298
transformer tower. Oh, w, OK, hey, you know,
so you got close to the ground.

213
00:13:54,298 --> 00:13:59,870
Then there'd be this flash of lightning arc
across from your sinus cavities right into

214
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,773
the metal tool shed. Oh yeah, then it would
ring.

215
00:14:07,011 --> 00:14:09,380
And this week builds on make right in the
woods.

216
00:14:10,514 --> 00:14:12,850
We're going to talk about first aid.

217
00:14:14,551 --> 00:14:17,855
I look after injuries, which is which is a
good thing, and now he's got a boat.

218
00:14:18,122 --> 00:14:23,627
I'd be an 80 90 pound bag of first aid
medical equipment there, so he's really well

219
00:14:23,627 --> 00:14:25,930
equipped. This is a surgical tape

220
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,731
And all all my research

221
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:33,370
Reports that all the pain, you know, the pain
goes right up, right up, your leg goes right

222
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,939
into your back there, gets into your central
nervous system.

223
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,578
But luckily, Bill had the surgical tape
right out there on a wrapper up and the kind

224
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:45,916
of a nice job, a little bit, a little bit of
a handy man secret weapon sneak into another

225
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,117
another part of the show here.

226
00:14:47,851 --> 00:14:51,855
It did a nice job. The unfortunate part is,
of course, you know it was the wrong foot.

227
00:14:53,157 --> 00:14:54,458
Yeah, yeah. No, it's not.

228
00:14:54,458 --> 00:15:00,898
It's that. Oh, and that not only up to the
backbone with the pain gets right up into

229
00:15:00,898 --> 00:15:02,499
your brain, your S.O.S.

230
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:06,970
Anyway, you got the you got the red, the
foot, correct foot all all wrapped up.

231
00:15:07,004 --> 00:15:14,578
Everything was, Oh guy, and now just get me
up into the standing position.

232
00:15:14,678 --> 00:15:16,213
You know, we were going to pretend, Oh,

233
00:15:16,747 --> 00:15:18,449
You know, the arms pump there? Oh, oh,

234
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:21,051
Oh, sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean any of
that, you know?

235
00:15:21,718 --> 00:15:23,220
But I was darn glad it happened.

236
00:15:24,254 --> 00:15:25,556
Oh God, don't stand

237
00:15:25,556 --> 00:15:32,062
On my foot bill. Anyway, if you can get me up
into now, this is kind of the cantilever

238
00:15:32,162 --> 00:15:33,864
seesaw kind of what I came up with.

239
00:15:33,997 --> 00:15:38,869
Unfortunately, Bill Bill went down, but I
really couldn't put any weight, any weight at

240
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:42,406
all on the ankle. So Bill says to me, What
do you need?

241
00:15:42,406 --> 00:15:48,011
Is some sort of a crutch there, you know,
and I didn't have a crutch in his bag, but

242
00:15:48,812 --> 00:15:51,515
it's going to take us in an economy he's
going to cut, you know, he's going to try and

243
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:54,618
cut something out of it and we get a big get
a branch.

244
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:59,823
What have you? And maybe, no, and that's
well, Bill, that's a little that's too.

245
00:15:59,823 --> 00:16:00,891
That's not going to make it.

246
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:04,394
That's a there's no that's too it's heavy
and it's too big.

247
00:16:04,394 --> 00:16:05,562
And no, it's not going to work.

248
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:06,830
No bill.

249
00:16:07,197 --> 00:16:09,399
Oh oh.

250
00:16:11,234 --> 00:16:13,737
All right, so now this required a little more
surgical tape.

251
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:16,707
Now the pain was running from my brain down
into my foot.

252
00:16:17,941 --> 00:16:22,913
So off he comes back with an olive branch,
he's going to make into a crutch because it

253
00:16:22,913 --> 00:16:25,415
had a little dark thing. And that's what you
need there.

254
00:16:25,415 --> 00:16:27,584
And a little high, though.

255
00:16:27,918 --> 00:16:29,953
I don't think many Boyle has a screening.

256
00:16:31,655 --> 00:16:33,223
Now, bill, you don't watch us bill.

257
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,827
Don't, don't look at the camera bill, you
know?

258
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,729
All right. Well, OK.

259
00:16:38,729 --> 00:16:41,965
So now I'm using the surgical tape on his
hand and.

260
00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:44,868
Now he's got the crutch. You think I'm going
to try this?

261
00:16:44,901 --> 00:16:46,903
I don't think so. I don't think so.

262
00:16:47,804 --> 00:16:48,939
Show us how it works, bill.

263
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:57,481
So now there's a whole sorry, I'm just
taking that up.

264
00:16:58,482 --> 00:17:03,754
That was a sling again out of the out of the
bag, and he's got a hand in a kind of a

265
00:17:03,754 --> 00:17:07,424
busted up arm and I got the head and the
foot thing, and now we'll get them up here,

266
00:17:07,457 --> 00:17:08,558
just get them up standing now.

267
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:11,161
You know, Bill doesn't look all that heavy,
but when he starts to run.

268
00:17:11,428 --> 00:17:14,598
Oh oh, oh, sorry, sorry, bill.

269
00:17:14,998 --> 00:17:20,036
So I got a little more of the surgical tape
and this was turning into quite a day.

270
00:17:20,036 --> 00:17:26,243
Really, we haven't felt this bad since New
Year's Day, so I've become now a bit woozy.

271
00:17:26,243 --> 00:17:30,413
So I thought, I, you know, this is the
fireman's lift, but you know, gravity is a

272
00:17:30,413 --> 00:17:31,915
funny thing that can stick and shift.

273
00:17:32,482 --> 00:17:36,319
Oh oh. Back, oh, golly.

274
00:17:37,687 --> 00:17:41,391
So this is something I found this darned
interesting, if you get a couple of polls and

275
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:45,061
you get a couple of little shirts out of
your laundry hamper and you can, what you do

276
00:17:45,061 --> 00:17:50,433
is you put the sleeves of the poles over the
sleeves of their shirts.

277
00:17:51,468 --> 00:17:53,169
All have a head injury there and over the
poles.

278
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:57,941
And what you can make is you make a
stretcher because once you get the sleeves on

279
00:17:57,941 --> 00:18:01,912
there, you do up the buttons and you got
yourself, you got yourself a stretcher.

280
00:18:02,812 --> 00:18:05,815
But I'll tell you at this point, I've had
enough of Bill.

281
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,184
I'm hurting. I'm tired.

282
00:18:08,184 --> 00:18:11,421
I'm hungry. Things happen now.

283
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:16,226
It's time to go, bill and try some first aid
on himself.

284
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:20,230
I'm out of here and over.

285
00:18:34,778 --> 00:18:38,715
Well, by golly, it's been it's been quite a
day, you know, after after a few trips to

286
00:18:38,715 --> 00:18:43,386
Murray's store, we had about as many work
socks as we were ever going to need at that

287
00:18:43,386 --> 00:18:45,722
price, who could say no even if they were
singles.

288
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,060
So you're pretty much given up on this refund
for the karaoke thing.

289
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,894
Is that what you're doing?

290
00:18:51,294 --> 00:18:52,996
Well, you're getting a little ahead of me
here, Harold.

291
00:18:53,129 --> 00:18:54,731
Well, that's not too hard to do.

292
00:18:56,499 --> 00:18:59,369
Think you can see why nepotism is the main
cause of heart attacks?

293
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:04,674
So Murray told Dwayne to fix the machine a
problem there being that Dwayne is not

294
00:19:04,674 --> 00:19:06,643
exactly a rocket scientist.

295
00:19:06,976 --> 00:19:08,144
He's more of a nose cone.

296
00:19:09,112 --> 00:19:12,715
So mainly Dwayne fixed a machine and he
plugged it in, and he ended up getting zapped

297
00:19:12,715 --> 00:19:15,051
worse than any worse.

298
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:17,420
Like, what is he singing like Broadway show
tunes, too?

299
00:19:18,087 --> 00:19:20,323
Well, no, Harold Dwayne had a different tape
in there.

300
00:19:20,323 --> 00:19:23,059
It was Lorne Green reading Robert Service
poetry.

301
00:19:24,093 --> 00:19:27,630
It was a nice change, you know, but I think
we're going to be able to straighten up this

302
00:19:27,797 --> 00:19:29,999
refund situation at tonight's Lodge meeting
or

303
00:19:31,868 --> 00:19:33,570
Oh, there it is. That's the call of the
meeting.

304
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,338
I'll go ahead. Come on. We got to go.

305
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:40,710
Well, if you'll just excuse me for a few
minutes here, I just got to go down to the

306
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:45,682
meet and straighten the whole deal up and
won't take too long while I'm gone.

307
00:19:45,882 --> 00:19:49,852
Why don't you just sit quietly and discuss
the favorite part of the show so far?

308
00:19:52,488 --> 00:19:53,590
Great. Great.

309
00:19:55,124 --> 00:20:01,197
Oh boy, oh boy.

310
00:20:02,131 --> 00:20:05,568
Oh boy.

311
00:20:05,768 --> 00:20:08,738
No. Sounds all right.

312
00:20:08,738 --> 00:20:16,813
All right. He

313
00:20:21,351 --> 00:20:22,885
recognizes Murray Woolworth.

314
00:20:23,219 --> 00:20:28,725
Thank you, red. Well, as you know, we at
Murray's pride ourselves on having the lowest

315
00:20:28,725 --> 00:20:29,792
prices around.

316
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:34,831
But that also means that refunds and
exchanges are a long shot at best.

317
00:20:35,898 --> 00:20:42,872
Well, even so, even so, we have done
everything in our power to satisfy Eddie

318
00:20:42,872 --> 00:20:47,610
here, which led to an unfortunate injury
sustained by my assistant, Duane.

319
00:20:48,177 --> 00:20:50,913
Now there may even be brain damage, but who
can tell?

320
00:20:51,747 --> 00:20:53,649
Don't worry about me, I'm fine now.

321
00:20:56,185 --> 00:21:01,691
Those three things done Neath the midnight
sun by the men who moil for gold.

322
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:04,460
Duane has nothing to do with this.

323
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:07,597
I want my feet to keep talking.

324
00:21:07,597 --> 00:21:09,765
Happy talk money back.

325
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:11,734
Don't you listen?

326
00:21:12,602 --> 00:21:13,903
Are you hard of hearing?

327
00:21:14,103 --> 00:21:15,204
Aren't you listening?

328
00:21:15,371 --> 00:21:17,773
Don't you listen? Can you not hear me?

329
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,045
You are not going to get your finger on the
marge of Lake Laborde.

330
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:25,514
I cremated Sam McGee.

331
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:27,383
Money back.

332
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:32,855
Oh, is that I enjoy being our girl.

333
00:21:34,156 --> 00:21:37,827
So look, if you think that you can.

334
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:42,465
Sam McGee came from Tennessee, where the
cotton.

335
00:21:43,899 --> 00:21:45,301
Tell me what to do.

336
00:21:45,301 --> 00:21:47,169
Well, then let me tell you.

337
00:21:58,748 --> 00:22:03,819
Well, Glenn, well, hi, sorry.

338
00:22:05,254 --> 00:22:05,921
Sorry, I'm late.

339
00:22:08,224 --> 00:22:10,559
Well, you to have anything else to say then.

340
00:22:12,094 --> 00:22:14,296
No, no, me neither.

341
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,364
No thoughts.

342
00:22:15,698 --> 00:22:17,433
What? No, that's from Dwayne.

343
00:22:17,433 --> 00:22:19,068
Well, this day is full of surprises, isn't
it?

344
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,638
What do you suppose? Just happen there, doc?

345
00:22:22,805 --> 00:22:29,245
Well, read Levi there created what's called a
spark capacitor and this charge dye on the

346
00:22:29,245 --> 00:22:33,716
bottom as it charges, which neutralizes the
electrical imbalances of the brain.

347
00:22:33,716 --> 00:22:35,985
Or or it's real love.

348
00:22:36,986 --> 00:22:38,387
It's too soon to tell.

349
00:22:38,387 --> 00:22:38,721
Really?

350
00:22:40,022 --> 00:22:43,826
Wow, hope for the best on that any other
large business bill?

351
00:22:44,593 --> 00:22:47,029
Ok, I'm going to call on Doc to give us the
evening's entertainment.

352
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:52,701
Hey, fellas.

353
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:58,207
Hell no. I don't think I've told all you
guys about the time the meeting Maury

354
00:22:58,207 --> 00:23:00,509
Amsterdam were fly fishing on the Dead Sea.

355
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:00,743
Yeah.

356
00:23:01,977 --> 00:23:04,914
Well, as we say up the lodge, we don't care
how it ends.

357
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:07,216
As long as it does, we can get our money
back.

358
00:23:07,516 --> 00:23:11,086
But any machine that can electrocute our
cook has to be worth something.

359
00:23:12,087 --> 00:23:13,756
And you don't see an Eddie and Wayne perform
together.

360
00:23:14,056 --> 00:23:15,958
You get a sense of why vaudeville died.

361
00:23:17,459 --> 00:23:21,030
If my wife is watching, I'll be coming
straight home after the meeting and I'm in

362
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:25,401
the mood for something dangerous, so you
might want to invite your folks over until

363
00:23:25,401 --> 00:23:29,505
next time. On behalf of myself and Harold
and the whole gang up here at Possum Lodge.

364
00:23:29,838 --> 00:23:30,839
Keep your stick on the ice.

365
00:23:35,144 --> 00:23:36,145
It was quite an act, one of the

366
00:23:36,145 --> 00:23:39,014
Times to bring it down there, I was down
there for about 40 feet.

367
00:23:39,448 --> 00:23:42,017
Google on the bottom water crystal clear.

368
00:23:42,017 --> 00:23:45,054
As far as you can see way up ahead of me, I
know there's no fish.

369
00:23:45,054 --> 00:23:49,191
If there is some kind of a weird kind of
human shape thing and it's paddling and

370
00:23:49,191 --> 00:23:52,061
kicking to beat the band, I look straight at
me as well.

371
00:23:52,861 --> 00:23:55,364
He's got boats, came on there with download.

372
00:23:55,998 --> 00:23:58,367
A good story, but a word of it a lot.
