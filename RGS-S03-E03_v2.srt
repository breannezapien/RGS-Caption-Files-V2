THE ROOF OF THE LODGE AND

113
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,128
I GOT AN IDEA, ACTUALLY IT

114
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,796
GAVE ME 2 IDEAS,

115
00:03:50,796 --> 00:03:51,897
THE FIRST ONE BEING DON'T EVER

116
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:53,332
BUNGEE JUMP BY TYING A BUNCH

117

OF OLD JOCK STRAPS TOGETHER,

118
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:56,602

GOING BY ON A LAWN TRACTOR

120
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:01,107
AND SECONDLY I GOT THE IDEA,

121
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,541
WHY DON'T WE MAKE A BUNGEE

122
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,344

THAT YOU GOT TO DO IS

125

GATHER UP ALL YOUR TOOLS,

126
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:11,584
THESE ARE A FEW THAT I FOUND

127
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,486

HERE'S TODAY'S LETTER,

00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:21,673
'DEAR EXPERTS, LAST FALL

229
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:23,275
MY BROTHER WENT DEER HUNTING

LAST NOVEMBER, DO YOU THINK

237
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:37,222
THE MEAT IS STILL SAFE TO EAT?'

238
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:37,856
I DON'T THINK WE NEED AN

239
00:07:37,856 --> 00:07:40,125
EXPERT TO ANSWER THIS ONE.

240
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:40,792
>>RED: WELL THAT'S

241
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:41,593

242
00:07:41,593 --> 00:07:44,463
WILL BE JUST FINE,

243
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:45,797
ISN'T THAT RIGHT HAP?

244
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:46,631
>>HAP: YEAH, ONE WINTER

245
00:07:46,631 --> 00:07:47,866
IS NOTHING, I REMEMBER WHEN

246
00:07:47,866 --> 00:07:49,968
I LEAD A GROUP OF ARCHEOLOGISTS,

247
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:52,070
DIGGERS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF

248
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,805
TEL AVIV ON AN EXPEDITION

249
00:07:53,805 --> 00:07:54,940
TO GREENLAND AND WE CAME ACROSS

250
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,808
THIS DINOSAUR THAT WAS FROZEN

251
00:07:56,808 --> 00:08:00,212
AND BURIED IN THE GLACIAL

252
00:08:00,212 --> 00:08:01,813
TUNDRA AND I THAWED IT OUT

253
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:06,351
AND THE MEAT WAS DELICIOUS.

254
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:07,252
>>RED: SO YOU ATE

255
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:09,054
BRONTOSAURUS HAP?

256
00:08:09,054 --> 00:08:11,022
>>HAP: NO NOT BRONTO,

257
00:08:11,022 --> 00:08:12,624
NO THIS WAS STRATO,

258
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:14,926
STRATOCUMULUSAURUS,

259
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:16,094
HE HAD FALLEN INTO AN

260
00:08:16,094 --> 00:08:17,162
ICE CREVICE AND IT WAS

261
00:08:17,162 --> 00:08:19,564
PERFECTLY PRESERVED,

262
00:08:19,564 --> 00:08:21,533
ALL EXCEPT THE TIP OF THE

263
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:23,268
TAIL THAT WAS A BIT RANCID.

264
00:08:23,268 --> 00:08:23,935
>>RED: WOW, HE'S THE

265
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:27,072
EXPERT ON RANCID TALES...

266
00:08:27,072 --> 00:08:28,306
SO TELL EVERYBODY HOW

267
00:08:28,306 --> 00:08:30,041
DID THE DINOSAUR TASTE?

268
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,109
>>HAP: DINOSAUR IS A BIT GAMIER

269
00:08:31,109 --> 00:08:33,378
THAN ANACONDA BUT NOT QUITE

270
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:36,848
AS FATTY AS SAY KILLER WHALE,

271
00:08:36,848 --> 00:08:37,482
THERE'S A LOT MORE MEAT ON

272
00:08:37,482 --> 00:08:40,085
THE STRATOCUMULUSAURUS,

273
00:08:40,085 --> 00:08:41,653

280
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:50,161
FLESH AND MAYBE TRY TO MARKET

281
00:08:50,161 --> 00:08:51,496
MY OWN BRAND OF DINOSAUR MEAT

282
00:08:51,496 --> 00:08:52,897
YOU KNOW BUT, I REGISTERED

283
00:08:52,897 --> 00:08:57,402

284
00:08:57,402 --> 00:09:02,207
>>RED: HAP'S DINO DOGS?

285
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,276
>>HAP: NOPE, JURASSIC PORK.

286
00:09:06,745 --> 00:09:08,079
>>RED: IT IS WINTER,

287
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:09,047
THE ANIMALS ARE WARMLY

288
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:11,483
TUCKED AWAY IN THEIR DENS

289
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:12,384
WITH A CASE OF 24 AND

290
00:09:12,384 --> 00:09:15,053
THE REMOTE CONTROLLER.

291
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:20,625
>>RED: OKAY THERE WE GO,

292
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,060
I CAN GO ANYWHERE AND FIX

293
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,697
ANYTHING AT ANY TIME.

294
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:28,233
I NEED A CURVED RASP PLANE,

295
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:31,803
GOT IT, COMPASS SAW, GOT IT,

296
00:09:31,803 --> 00:09:34,572
SCREW-MATE DRILL BIT,

297
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:36,374
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

298
00:09:36,374 --> 00:09:37,342
NOW WHAT ELSE COULD I USE?

299
00:09:37,342 --> 00:09:38,743
WELL IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO HAVE

300
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:42,480
A LITTLE EXTRA LIGHT ON A JOB

301
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,149
OR SAY A THIRD HAND WOULD

302
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:45,750
COME IN HANDY AND A LOT OF

303
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,584
THE GUYS AT THE LODGE SAY

304
00:09:46,584 --> 00:09:47,552
THAT I COULD USE

305
00:09:47,552 --> 00:09:50,822
A LITTLE HEAD PROTECTION,

306
00:09:50,822 --> 00:09:53,625
WELL WHY NOT COMBINE ALL 3?

307
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,928
THAT'S HANDYMAN THINKING.

308
00:09:56,928 --> 00:09:58,797
OKAY SO THERE IT IS,

309
00:09:58,797 --> 00:09:59,664
I CAN NOW GO ANYWHERE AT

310
00:09:59,664 --> 00:10:01,933
ANYTIME AND FIX ANYTHING,

311
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:02,834
ALTHOUGH I WOULDN'T ADVISE

312
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:04,002
GOING OUT INTO THE WOODS

313
00:10:04,002 --> 00:10:06,638
WHEN THE MOOSE ARE IN HEAT.

314
00:10:06,638 --> 00:10:07,839
NOW I HAVE ADDED ANOTHER

315
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:08,606
SAFETY ELEMENT HERE WITH

316
00:10:08,606 --> 00:10:09,574
A LITTLE YOGURT TUB

317
00:10:09,574 --> 00:10:11,242
FULL OF BAKING SODA.

318
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:12,243
SO IF I'M SOLDERING OR WELDING

319
00:10:12,243 --> 00:10:13,845
OR WHAT HAVE YOU AND SUDDENLY

320
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:15,113
THE WHOLE WORKBENCH AND MOST

321
00:10:15,113 --> 00:10:17,949
OF THE FURNITURE'S ON FIRE,

322
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:21,085
I CAN JUST LEAN FORWARD QUICKLY,

323
00:10:21,085 --> 00:10:22,153
AND HOPEFULLY THE FIRE GOES OUT

324
00:10:22,153 --> 00:10:22,987
FAST BECAUSE I ACTUALLY HAVE

325
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:24,422
MY FACE RIGHT INTO THE

326
00:10:24,422 --> 00:10:26,691
FLAMES AT THAT POINT.

327
00:10:26,691 --> 00:10:27,659
SO THIS REALLY IS

328
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:29,627
A WEARABLE WORKSHOP

329
00:10:29,627 --> 00:10:31,696
KIND OF A NEAT LOOKING UNIT,

330
00:10:31,696 --> 00:10:32,697
IT'S A FASHION STATEMENT

331
00:10:32,697 --> 00:10:34,432
REALLY THAT SAYS,

332
00:10:34,432 --> 00:10:36,100
HEY WORLD I'M A TOOL.

333
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,201
SO UNTIL NEXT TIME REMEMBER,

334
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:38,002
IF THE WOMEN DON'T FIND

335
00:10:38,002 --> 00:10:39,137
YOU HANDSOME, THEY SHOULD

336
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:41,406
AT LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

337
00:10:41,406 --> 00:10:42,941
I THINK I'LL JUST GO AND

338
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:45,410

404
00:12:25,243 --> 00:12:26,911
TOO NARROW FOR A BIG TRUCK.

>>DOUGIE: WELL IT IS,

406

DOWNHILL SKIING AND HE HAD

525
00:15:44,942 --> 00:15:46,076
GOTTEN ALL THE EQUIPMENT

555
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:38,295
EXTRA SPIN WHEN YOU'RE GOING SO,

556
00:16:38,295 --> 00:16:39,629
OH, OH, OH THANKS BILL.

557
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:41,965

00:21:22,945 --> 00:21:24,647
I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE

703

709
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,925
OF LIMESTONE INTO THE LAKE

710
00:21:35,925 --> 00:21:38,027
WHICH COST US $280 BUCKS AND

711
00:21:38,027 --> 00:21:38,861
THEN WE GOT A CHEQUE FROM

712
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:40,162
THE GOVERNMENT FOR $102

713
00:21:40,162 --> 00:21:40,963
SO IT'S JUST LIKE INCOME TAX

THE FISH AND WHO KNOWS,

720
00:21:48,471 --> 00:21:49,205
MAYBE YOU'LL RETRIEVE

721

724
00:21:54,043 --> 00:21:55,044
HIT THE BACKHOE IT JUST

725
00:21:55,044 --> 00:21:56,012
KIND OF DISINTEGRATED INTO

726
00:21:56,012 --> 00:21:57,947
A CLOUD OF RUST,

727
00:21:57,947 --> 00:21:59,148
KIND OF A LOW RUMBLE,

728
00:21:59,148 --> 00:22:00,850
BAD SMELL AND THEN THE TIRES

729
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:04,120
POPPED TO THE SURFACE.

730

00:22:05,755 --> 00:22:07,089

00:22:12,228 --> 00:22:12,828
THEN THEY SANK TAKING

737
00:22:12,828 --> 00:22:15,831
