1
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,981
And now it's the beginning of our show, the
part where the camera comes up the hallway at

2
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:52,051
great expense to us, but you know, that's
because the Dolly rental and things like

3
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:56,523
that. Of course, we're just, you know, an
indication to show you how much we're willing

4
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:57,957
to do to put on a good show.

5
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,226
And you know, that's why we're showing you
in the hallway.

6
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,129
Anyway, here's a man who pays for the dollar
in every way.

7
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,231
My uncle and the star of the Red Green Show,
Mr.

8
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:06,766
Red Green.

9
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:12,538
Harold, thank you and welcome to Possum
Lodge.

10
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,944
Harold produces and directs the show and
everything else that I don't feel like doing

11
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,113
or think is important or understand or care
about it.

12
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:23,816
I think it's very important to the look in
the pace of the show, especially, you know,

13
00:01:23,816 --> 00:01:24,884
like the special effects.

14
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:30,690
Well, I think that's at least as helpful as
that Dolly is.

15
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:34,193
Oh, speaking of Dolly's, our head of security
is getting married.

16
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,996
What? Nor- North getting married?

17
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,232
Oh, I don't even know he was dating a girl.

18
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,668
Oh yeah. It all happened.

19
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:46,572
Last week, he and junior singleton were
skinny dipping down suicide rock, which is

20
00:01:46,572 --> 00:01:49,909
pretty gutsy when you consider the amount of
carnivorous wildlife that hangs out down

21
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:53,946
there. Anyway, they're right in the middle
of a dip, skin wise, and a couple of women

22
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:59,152
came by and wow, the story gets a little
fuzzy here, but it ends up with Noel

23
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,286
proposing to one of them.

24
00:02:00,486 --> 00:02:03,089
And the surprise is that what he proposed
was marriage.

25
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:04,791
That's a parallel

26
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,527
Fact. Sorry, miss that.

27
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:07,894
Sorry.

28
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,931
I just think Noel's engaged in what he
married Cheryl.

29
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,933
Noel is going to marry one of those women.

30
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,736
Oh, that means Junior's going to marry the
other one.

31
00:02:17,236 --> 00:02:18,604
Well, he's going to check it with his present
wife.

32
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:20,406
I don't think it looks good. You know,

33
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:23,042
I was just thinking, you know what I mean?

34
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:26,946
Like, if Noel can find a woman, maybe
there's hope for me too.

35
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:29,315
You know what I mean? Noel Clayton, I
certainly could.

36
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:31,584
Well, maybe I should go skinny dipping for
Mrs.

37
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:32,285
Wright

38
00:02:32,718 --> 00:02:33,519
Or Mr. Snapping

39
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:33,920
Turtle

40
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:38,591
And had dates before, you know, but that was
usually on dates with women.

41
00:02:38,624 --> 00:02:39,926
This is this was totally different.

42
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,727
This one. Belinda Lind is her name.

43
00:02:41,727 --> 00:02:45,665
Well, Linda actually didn't mind talking to
Noel for a few minutes, and as far as he's

44
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,099
concerned, that's love.

45
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:52,071
That's a little skeptical, you know, love at
first sight, especially if the first sight is

46
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:52,638
of Noel.

47
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:57,343
You really don't think you know you guys are
in any position to be judging relationships.

48
00:02:57,376 --> 00:03:00,413
I mean, if you knew anything about women,
you wouldn't spend half of your life up at

49
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:00,913
this lodge

50
00:03:00,913 --> 00:03:02,448
And the other half sleeping well.

51
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,050
Well, we know how to get along with women,
Harold.

52
00:03:04,283 --> 00:03:05,384
It's just tiring. That's all.

53
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,988
Wow. Understanding and sensitivity.

54
00:03:09,288 --> 00:03:13,759
All right. Yeah. Anyway, nobody's going to
tie the old Slipknot next week and everybody

55
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,860
at the lodge is invited. It's kind of
exciting.

56
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:18,931
So a bunch of us all went back for another
skinny dip and we decided that junior is the

57
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:23,903
best man. So we're going to have the wedding
put out by the sister there, where the

58
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:24,971
mosquitoes are real bad.

59
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:27,573
And that way the minister will keep
everything kind of goose in the long course.

60
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,842
Where have they decided to go like on their
honeymoon?

61
00:03:30,676 --> 00:03:32,211
Are they going to Des Moines, Iowa, Harold?

62
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:35,014
Yeah, there's a Chuck Norris film festival
down there.

63
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,982
Kind of a lifelong dream for Noel.

64
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,152
They've to register the China pattern with
seven 11.

65
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:44,523
I wonder what I should get, Noel, for his
pre-nup nuptials.

66
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,659
Well, I think the doctors will take care of
that.

67
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:58,370
Harold, have you seen how long the grass is?

68
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,506
No, I've seen how green is my valley?

69
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,808
Is this like a sequel or something?

70
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,543
I'm talking about the grass out behind the
lodge.

71
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:08,714
We can't have an unkempt lawn with Noel's
wedding coming up.

72
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,249
It looks scrappy.

73
00:04:11,383 --> 00:04:13,352
Why don't you go out there and cut that
lawn?

74
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:19,658
It's a field, yes, but it doesn't have to be
a messy field.

75
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,261
I could pay you.

76
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:24,196
I want a thousand dollars in a tractor.

77
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:29,468
Yes, I'm sure you would. But as large
treasurer, I'd have to say, get real.

78
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,972
And perhaps one of your school chums could
do it.

79
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,306
Oh no.

80
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,675
They hit me every time I asked them things
like that.

81
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:40,179
Well, I'm just I'm just going to have to go
out there and do it myself.

82
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:43,048
Is that what you want? I hadn't really
thought about it.

83
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:51,123
Yes, I do, I. But I'm having a little
trouble getting your nephew to help me out

84
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:51,724
here, read.

85
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:52,791
No kidding.

86
00:04:54,827 --> 00:05:03,369
But. Ok, I got a little stag thing pretty
well set up.

87
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:06,672
We're having a stag for Noel.

88
00:05:07,606 --> 00:05:09,041
This is the first time I've heard about it.

89
00:05:09,074 --> 00:05:11,010
How come nobody told me anything?

90
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:13,679
Try coming to the lodge meetings, bob that
sometimes works.

91
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,547
No, not stags. No.

92
00:05:15,547 --> 00:05:17,483
Stags are a pagan ritual and I will not be
involved.

93
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,586
You go right ahead if you like, but I will
not be there.

94
00:05:22,354 --> 00:05:22,921
Of course, it looks like

95
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:24,056
I'm not invited either.

96
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:29,428
I made this list up of what we'll need for a
major party.

97
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:33,565
Ok, the flares are optional, but I thought
they'd be a nice touch and we're going to

98
00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:35,000
have to get a couple more cases of beer.

99
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:38,470
My brother's coming. Is that wedding gift
coming

100
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,071
There, bill?

101
00:05:41,273 --> 00:05:43,142
Great. Don't forget the salami.

102
00:05:45,477 --> 00:05:48,647
Sorry. Figuring on holding his wing being in
the lodge helmet.

103
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:51,216
No, in the woods are more washrooms.

104
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:55,788
I mean, we'll have to come in for a while
because it's too dark to see the stripper

105
00:05:57,122 --> 00:05:57,556
skipper.

106
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,491
No, no, no, no, no, no.

107
00:05:59,491 --> 00:06:01,860
Strippers. Strippers are sexist and archaic.

108
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,197
No, no, no. Do you honestly believe that the
bride is over there having a male stripper

109
00:06:05,197 --> 00:06:10,669
and her shower? Oh, OK, yes, we know she is,
but the point is we should be setting an

110
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:11,370
example.

111
00:06:11,436 --> 00:06:13,605
Well, we'll just turn the other cheek.

112
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,476
No, wait, Harold's, right?

113
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:22,314
Well, there's two words I never thought I'd
say together anyway.

114
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:23,916
We can do much better than that.

115
00:06:24,316 --> 00:06:29,254
We can have a civilized stag, not a game of
golf, but a game of golf.

116
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:32,491
The No. Open a game of golf.

117
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:35,460
Thirty six pools of camaraderie, revelry,
jocularity.

118
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:40,966
Of course, all proceeds go to Noel, then
later will gather in the pro shop and sing

119
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:42,034
Scottish tunes.

120
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:44,770
Armstrong this stag is for members only.

121
00:06:44,803 --> 00:06:45,938
Harry Lauder is not coming.

122
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:50,175
We have to do with members of Possum Lodge
have always done its tradition.

123
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:55,714
The party, the beer, the stripper, the fist
fight that drive to the hospital.

124
00:06:55,714 --> 00:07:01,420
It's tradition. You see, maybe you don't
remember, but I work for the natural

125
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,991
resources. Oh, well, bunch of lodge members
are going to be caper in about in the in the

126
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:09,161
woods. Well, I've got a concern myself with
environmental damage.

127
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:13,198
The woods affair a hell of a lot better than
the golf course will tell you that.

128
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:15,600
Well, no stag.

129
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:17,002
Why don't we let him decide?

130
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,004
No, we're talking about.

131
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:19,671
No, no.

132
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:22,374
Yeah, you're right.

133
00:07:22,407 --> 00:07:25,410
Who wants to spend the whole evening playing
ping pong and eating yogurt?

134
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:27,579
Let me know what you figure out anyway.

135
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,115
You know, the lodge is supposed to be a
democracy.

136
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:34,286
Why don't we let just the majority decide
we'll have a vote tonight at the Lodge

137
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:34,653
meeting?

138
00:07:34,653 --> 00:07:36,988
But if it's a tie, we'll let the stripper
vote.

139
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:39,691
Fine. No, no, no, no, no, no.

140
00:07:39,691 --> 00:07:43,562
Only lodge members can vote unless, of
course, one of the Lodge members is the

141
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:44,963
Stripper, and he takes his clothes off.

142
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:47,732
Oh, he's not, is he?

143
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,542
Oh, the cold, cold rain

144
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:59,311
Comes out of the sky.

145
00:07:59,544 --> 00:08:02,881
It lands on things that were formerly dry.

146
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:09,221
It runs down the roof and drips from the air
and lets you know exactly where your bald

147
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:10,255
spots are.

148
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:19,197
This week on and back corner talk about
recycling.

149
00:08:20,432 --> 00:08:25,303
If you're like me, I hate to throw things
away, you know, bits of string or newspapers

150
00:08:25,303 --> 00:08:30,742
or our old engines and stuff, you know, and
what are you going to do with an old engine,

151
00:08:30,742 --> 00:08:35,981
you know now? I suppose I could take this
down to the auto workers or scrap iron yard

152
00:08:35,981 --> 00:08:37,582
or whatever and get a few dollars for it.

153
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:41,553
But you know the hassle of me driving down
there in the truck.

154
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,455
You know what? The cost of gas being what it
is.

155
00:08:43,588 --> 00:08:46,691
And of course, I'd have to put this actually
install this back into the truck before I

156
00:08:46,691 --> 00:08:47,859
could drive down there. And so.

157
00:08:48,293 --> 00:08:49,694
So what am I going to do with this old
engine?

158
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:55,433
Well, I know that ordinarily what you do is
you dip down to a conservation area and just

159
00:08:55,433 --> 00:08:56,735
dump it into a ravine or something.

160
00:08:58,003 --> 00:08:59,104
I'd like to show you something kind of
interesting.

161
00:08:59,571 --> 00:09:04,542
I'm going to show you how you can equip your
whole kitchen from one engine.

162
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:10,415
Now, everybody with the space between their
teeth likes corn on the cob.

163
00:09:11,116 --> 00:09:14,819
And what an interesting way to hold the corn
on the cob and to take your valves out of

164
00:09:14,819 --> 00:09:18,156
your engine and thrust them into the ends of
your crop.

165
00:09:19,457 --> 00:09:25,597
And then you can take the the valve cover off
the motor, and this is a handy trait to hold

166
00:09:25,597 --> 00:09:31,002
your your butter, just roll it in there or
you can make it 10 W30 if it's to go.

167
00:09:33,638 --> 00:09:38,843
I don't care where you go, you're not going
to find a better frying pan than an air

168
00:09:38,843 --> 00:09:41,413
cleaner. Get your bacon around the outside
there.

169
00:09:41,913 --> 00:09:43,748
Do pancakes a little twisting them up in the
middle.

170
00:09:44,315 --> 00:09:45,950
And then of course, you comes with a lid.

171
00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:51,523
Pop that right on and what the wingnut on
her there.

172
00:09:51,556 --> 00:09:52,891
You got yourself a pressure cooker.

173
00:09:53,224 --> 00:09:56,227
Unbelievable. Other than kind of
interesting.

174
00:09:57,662 --> 00:09:59,197
I don't care where you go, who you know
what?

175
00:09:59,364 --> 00:10:03,535
You see what you do. You are not going to
find a better roasting pan than the sump pan

176
00:10:03,535 --> 00:10:09,407
off of a motor. You ever try to ladle soup
in the kitchen?

177
00:10:09,741 --> 00:10:10,775
It's a real problem.

178
00:10:11,176 --> 00:10:12,377
Makes a big mess all over the place.

179
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:20,084
What you do is take your exhaust manifold,
line up the parts over the soup bowls, but

180
00:10:20,084 --> 00:10:22,086
the soup into a pitcher of some kind.

181
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:25,957
And then you just pour the soup right up
your own tailpipe.

182
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:32,330
How about that, huh?

183
00:10:32,997 --> 00:10:35,700
See, then you're going to throw this stuff
out.

184
00:10:37,635 --> 00:10:42,240
So until next time, the women don't find you
handsome, least find your handy.

185
00:10:43,474 --> 00:10:44,809
How about some more suit guys

186
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:47,478
Coming right up? Yes.

187
00:10:50,682 --> 00:10:52,116
Oh, nuts, we got the junkie.

188
00:10:57,255 --> 00:11:04,462
Typekit. It is autumn time to get the vote
out of the lake.

189
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,098
If only you can remember where it sank.

190
00:11:10,134 --> 00:11:18,309
The. So anyway, everything's kind of coming
together for the wedding, you know, Junior

191
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:20,244
Sexton's wife, has accepted his apology.

192
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,249
Junior says, you know, he could make it a
double ring ceremony where Noel and Belinda,

193
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:30,288
we get married and then Junior and his wife,
who could renew their vows, but his wife's

194
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:31,355
not too keen on that.

195
00:11:31,556 --> 00:11:34,759
She says she's not sorry that she married
him, but she's had 10 years to kind of think

196
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,094
it over and let's not push it.

197
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:41,566
I think weddings forced you into that sort of
thinking, you know, you reevaluate your

198
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:43,534
marriage in your life or what have you.

199
00:11:43,835 --> 00:11:44,969
Yeah, and what have you, Harold?

200
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:48,673
Oh, I have my my hobbies in my work, you
know, like this?

201
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:51,476
Oh, you mean if I could find you a wife,
you'd quit.

202
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:55,012
Oh no, I'm not into those pre-arranged
marriage things.

203
00:11:55,046 --> 00:11:58,850
I mean, love and destiny are the stars of
which I steer my life by.

204
00:11:59,984 --> 00:12:00,985
I think you're like that.

205
00:12:01,118 --> 00:12:02,720
Oh, yes, I do.

206
00:12:03,621 --> 00:12:04,755
How did you now furnish me?

207
00:12:04,789 --> 00:12:05,223
Go ahead.

208
00:12:06,057 --> 00:12:07,358
Well, she was the only one who answered the
ad.

209
00:12:08,826 --> 00:12:10,194
See, now I know that's a lie.

210
00:12:10,194 --> 00:12:14,098
I know that. I know that deep down, you are
a happily married man.

211
00:12:14,832 --> 00:12:16,767
Well, yeah, yeah.

212
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,269
You're right, Harold.

213
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:20,504
You know you're an Renesas made me what I am
today.

214
00:12:21,806 --> 00:12:23,074
Don't ever say that to her uncle.

215
00:12:23,074 --> 00:12:25,243
Read That could be oh, so hurtful.

216
00:12:32,283 --> 00:12:33,684
I ask you a question here for a minute.

217
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:36,454
I'm a bit busy right here, Fred.

218
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:38,623
Well, that's OK. I don't mind.

219
00:12:39,256 --> 00:12:40,324
It's about Noel Stagg.

220
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:42,226
I need to ask you about money.

221
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:44,629
It's always about money.

222
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:47,198
Isn't it red? Douglas, can we spare some
money?

223
00:12:47,598 --> 00:12:49,400
Douglas, can I have some money?

224
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:51,736
Douglas How many quarters in a dollar?

225
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:54,839
But why do people always bother me with
money problems?

226
00:12:55,773 --> 00:12:57,108
Well, probably because you're the lodge
treasurer.

227
00:12:58,109 --> 00:13:00,678
Well, I'm a treasurer without a treasure.

228
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:03,948
I'm sorry. Read the men are just going to
have to pass the hat.

229
00:13:04,849 --> 00:13:06,283
Oh, I don't think so, Douglas.

230
00:13:06,283 --> 00:13:10,287
I mean, everybody likes Noel, you know, but
not enough to actually cough up some money

231
00:13:10,287 --> 00:13:10,721
for him.

232
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,992
How much money are we wasting here anyway?

233
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,529
Well, it depends what kind of a stag you're
talking about right now.

234
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:23,701
It's either going to be a friendly game of
golf or a pagan ceremony in the jungle.

235
00:13:24,969 --> 00:13:26,403
A golf tournament

236
00:13:26,403 --> 00:13:27,171
Would be more

237
00:13:27,171 --> 00:13:29,173
Expensive than a jungle orgy.

238
00:13:29,273 --> 00:13:30,441
Yeah, that's what we figured, too.

239
00:13:30,808 --> 00:13:35,312
Helmut says he can bring it in for under two
hundred bucks, and that would include a

240
00:13:35,312 --> 00:13:39,750
mirror ball, fireworks, bricklayers trowel.

241
00:13:39,783 --> 00:13:43,187
That's a gift. Seven cases of beer.

242
00:13:43,687 --> 00:13:46,957
Half a dozen carrot sticks and a stripper.

243
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,393
Well, you can stop right there, Mr.

244
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,098
I'm not going to be any part of a sexist,
disgusting display of female flesh.

245
00:13:54,098 --> 00:13:55,232
It's degrading.

246
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,935
Well, we weren't asking you to go, Douglas.

247
00:13:57,935 --> 00:13:59,036
We just want you to pay for it.

248
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:05,876
Doesn't someone just go into town and rent
some movies, you know, like maybe Fellini's,

249
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:10,948
Amarcord or Bunuel's, the discreet charm of
the bourgeoisie, and then we can sit and

250
00:14:10,948 --> 00:14:12,716
watch films and eat popcorn.

251
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:18,822
I like going to see, you know, we're talking
about some pretty modest attention spans the

252
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:21,558
I don't really think we've got the subtitles
crowd in there.

253
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,428
I'm sorry that I tried to help.

254
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:29,166
You know, I have to buy a new toilet seat
and you're asking me for stag money.

255
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:29,833
What would you

256
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,635
Do? Well, it depends when you ask me

257
00:14:34,538 --> 00:14:36,340
What is wrong with this thing?

258
00:14:36,707 --> 00:14:39,877
Why is it that the things all around here
always just break and fall apart?

259
00:14:40,544 --> 00:14:50,320
Well, let me give it a try for those of you
who have watched our show more than once.

260
00:14:50,387 --> 00:14:54,525
First of all, get help now and secondly this
year recognise this bit because this is

261
00:14:54,591 --> 00:14:58,896
actually part two of an adventure of a bill
we did earlier where he cut his forehead with

262
00:14:58,896 --> 00:15:01,265
a knife. But this is how to find food in the
woods.

263
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:06,070
What he's doing here and part two is he says
that in certain kinds of trees, you can just

264
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,205
peel the bark off and chew it.

265
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:11,775
It's got protein in there and it's got rival
rival.

266
00:15:13,977 --> 00:15:18,715
It's got stuff in it. That's good for him
too, you know, by golly, he's just chewy.

267
00:15:21,251 --> 00:15:24,421
I wouldn't say that it had a shortage of
taste.

268
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:27,024
It just had a shortage of good taste.

269
00:15:27,991 --> 00:15:32,095
By golly, she was chewy and I thought, I
think I might have a better application for

270
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:41,738
this. And now

271
00:15:41,872 --> 00:15:44,908
they'll locks up the tree there and sees a
nest was there.

272
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,144
What do you think is going to be a couple of
eggs in there?

273
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:53,250
So he needs a little boost up and bail is
put on a fair bit of weight since we used to

274
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,985
do this when we were six and seven years
old.

275
00:15:56,687 --> 00:15:59,056
Now is aiming isn't any better either.

276
00:16:00,691 --> 00:16:08,932
And this is taking far too long that you
don't want someone to come across you in the

277
00:16:08,932 --> 00:16:11,401
woods. When you're doing that, I'll tell you
anyway, why don't we just get the ladder in

278
00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:19,476
the first place? So now stands a ladder up
after hurting me, bad, and I'm going to hold

279
00:16:19,476 --> 00:16:20,510
steady the ladder for him.

280
00:16:20,944 --> 00:16:24,548
He's going to go up there and that's one of
them three legged cherry picking ladders.

281
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:27,718
I believe he's going to go up and do a
little cherry picking of his own.

282
00:16:28,385 --> 00:16:29,386
There's an egg right there.

283
00:16:29,486 --> 00:16:30,520
That's a big bird.

284
00:16:31,955 --> 00:16:39,763
Two eggs, sunny side up and and a strip of
bacon may not be a bird's nest.

285
00:16:39,763 --> 00:16:43,100
It might actually be a Denny's other egg.

286
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,768
There he's doing real close ups.

287
00:16:45,068 --> 00:16:48,271
Oh no, I get mad and I pull a ladder over.

288
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:55,946
As a embarrassed about that, but not not too
bad a kind of gays are now in the nest cams

289
00:16:55,946 --> 00:16:59,783
that could have got the exact way anyway and
funny, how life's fair sometimes.

290
00:17:01,084 --> 00:17:01,351
But.

291
00:17:14,164 --> 00:17:16,266
And. And.

292
00:17:20,103 --> 00:17:23,340
Well, apparently a decision has been made
about Noel Stagg.

293
00:17:23,874 --> 00:17:27,377
Whatever it is and wherever it is going to
happen, it's going to take place after the

294
00:17:27,377 --> 00:17:31,281
Lodge meeting tonight. You know, the lodge
has quite a history of stags over the last

295
00:17:31,314 --> 00:17:36,353
hundred years and actually the old man
Sedgwick has been to all of them, in fact,

296
00:17:36,353 --> 00:17:37,954
that his own stag, he has such a good time.

297
00:17:37,988 --> 00:17:42,058
He actually missed his wedding day and
luckily his bride ran off with the caterer.

298
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:47,831
I remember in Bill Smith's Stag, a whole
bunch of us got up in a tree and then and

299
00:17:47,831 --> 00:17:49,065
then helmet cut it down,

300
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:49,733
You

301
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:53,737
Know? And what? What we thought was just a
social error turned out to be the chainsaw

302
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:57,374
backfiring. We set the tree on fire, burn us
all to the ground.

303
00:17:58,408 --> 00:18:03,280
I got it. I do not know how you can associate
risking life and limb with a good time.

304
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,784
I mean, whatever happened to like, good
conversation, dancing, music, pop, you know,

305
00:18:07,851 --> 00:18:08,585
stuff like that.

306
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:10,787
Well, Harold, it's not enough to enjoy a
party.

307
00:18:11,187 --> 00:18:15,992
You know, you have to survive the party
after one of our stags 50 years of marriage

308
00:18:15,992 --> 00:18:16,660
is a cakewalk.

309
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:21,197
Oh, OK, well, I guess we should bring this up
in the next meeting.

310
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:22,632
I'll see you down there, OK?

311
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:28,538
Don't worry, we're not going to let a hundred
years of tradition go down the drain just to

312
00:18:28,538 --> 00:18:32,108
allow some common sense to get between us
and a little harmful fun

313
00:18:33,209 --> 00:18:36,413
That ring ring ring.

314
00:18:41,484 --> 00:18:46,923
Oh, you are great.

315
00:18:49,592 --> 00:18:51,861
All right, guys.

316
00:18:51,861 --> 00:19:00,537
I'm gonna get you down to the bank.

317
00:19:02,338 --> 00:19:04,073
So is a lucky groom here?

318
00:19:04,107 --> 00:19:05,742
No, no, no. This is perfect.

319
00:19:05,742 --> 00:19:06,042
We're going to.

320
00:19:07,076 --> 00:19:09,312
All right. All right. This helmet, Whittaker.

321
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,148
Good news, guys. The stag is on.

322
00:19:14,984 --> 00:19:18,087
What did the beer and any city's going to
prepare some food so we can use it in the

323
00:19:18,087 --> 00:19:23,259
food fight? Well, actually hang on a second
just a minute here, guys.

324
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,598
I've been checking the fire danger reports
and the forest is tinder dry.

325
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:31,267
The stag could turn into a huge inferno.

326
00:19:34,871 --> 00:19:36,806
We're now on day on.

327
00:19:37,607 --> 00:19:41,911
And what do you think about this while we
take this tag and move it right onto the golf

328
00:19:41,911 --> 00:19:42,378
course?

329
00:19:44,714 --> 00:19:48,051
What was the second look for the

330
00:19:48,051 --> 00:19:52,188
Golf course is it's always watered, so
there's no possibility there will be a fire.

331
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:56,793
50 guys out there playing golf in the middle
of the night.

332
00:19:57,827 --> 00:20:02,165
I could get those ah glow in the dark golf
balls from my friend at the atomic energy,

333
00:20:02,165 --> 00:20:04,767
you know? I thought it would be fun.

334
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:10,440
You can bring bring all the beer you out
onto the course.

335
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:14,877
Know, maybe I could get one.

336
00:20:15,178 --> 00:20:17,246
Why don't we use the balls that don't glow
in the dark?

337
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:19,148
That'll add a little edge to the game.

338
00:20:19,682 --> 00:20:24,020
And then afterwards, we're going to have a
demolition derby with the golf cart.

339
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:30,393
Terror shovels, huh? Well, we're all the
Greens are not grass, I pay a million

340
00:20:30,393 --> 00:20:34,030
Dollars a square inch for it. We just shovel
underneath it all over.

341
00:20:41,738 --> 00:20:45,308
Well, I think probably having the party in
the forests would be fine

342
00:20:46,776 --> 00:20:50,346
On a golf course is green because, you know,
I don't want to shut up travel tour because

343
00:20:50,413 --> 00:20:53,382
we got what we do, right? We go skinny
dipping in the water hazards, right?

344
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:55,685
Yap, Yap, Yap. No. And then you know what
else we do?

345
00:20:55,685 --> 00:20:56,786
We get out into dry off.

346
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:03,926
We roll around in the sand and the sand
traps rolling around to get dry in the set.

347
00:21:03,926 --> 00:21:06,996
I'm not invited, so it's not like a point or
something.

348
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:10,933
But I understand there's going to be a
stripper.

349
00:21:14,103 --> 00:21:16,906
The speed, Belinda Bettendorf.

350
00:21:20,076 --> 00:21:24,080
I feel better he got so excited he burst into
tears, ran up the suicide rocket.

351
00:21:24,647 --> 00:21:26,749
Well, he said waste that we. Belinda
Bettendorf.

352
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:31,888
That's the name of Noel's Bryant Knowles
marrying a stripper.

353
00:21:32,154 --> 00:21:39,228
I know he thinks he seems to think that
she's a legal secretary.

354
00:21:40,296 --> 00:21:42,898
Well, don't you see, that's why Noel is
crying.

355
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:45,735
He's probably calling off the wedding by
now.

356
00:21:46,502 --> 00:21:50,206
She lost her job. No, I think Douglas is
right, guys.

357
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,341
We've all just been snookered out of

358
00:21:52,341 --> 00:21:54,343
A stag party. Oh.

359
00:21:56,312 --> 00:21:59,215
Oh, oh, god, no.

360
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:01,250
It's like

361
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:05,655
Business. Not just give us some entertainment

362
00:22:07,723 --> 00:22:09,725
First, what us to be family first one.

363
00:22:10,426 --> 00:22:12,662
Well, boys, I've got something special for
you.

364
00:22:13,963 --> 00:22:15,765
I'm going to show you how to juggle.

365
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:21,370
Now, of course, we're all pretty disappointed
about there being no stag.

366
00:22:22,271 --> 00:22:24,140
I guess we're going to have to come to terms
with that.

367
00:22:24,673 --> 00:22:29,211
You know that our hopes and our dreams are
dashed and our plans for nothing.

368
00:22:29,211 --> 00:22:31,881
And we've all been kind of betrayed on some
level.

369
00:22:34,116 --> 00:22:38,087
I guess in time we'll be able to forgive
Noel, you know, time heals all wounds and all

370
00:22:38,087 --> 00:22:44,894
that. But still, you know, as for Noah, I'm
sure that out there somewhere is a short,

371
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,330
bullheaded female correctional officer who
would like to be Mrs.

372
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,533
Noel Christmas. Noel Christmas.

373
00:22:50,533 --> 00:22:54,870
Yeah, that's his name. Of course, the people
that gave him that name would be her in-laws.

374
00:22:56,005 --> 00:23:00,342
Anyway, if my wife is watching, I'm going to
be coming straight home after the meeting,

375
00:23:00,342 --> 00:23:03,345
and hopefully Noel will had a chance to
return our gift.

376
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:06,448
So until next time.

377
00:23:06,515 --> 00:23:10,219
On behalf of myself and Harold and the whole
gang up here at Possum Lodge.

378
00:23:10,486 --> 00:23:11,520
Keep your stick on the ice.

379
00:23:18,861 --> 00:23:20,362
It looks harder than it is.

380
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:32,675
Well, you can even do this well, you know,
with other people, Bob, why don't you go out

381
00:23:32,675 --> 00:23:34,677
there and show the boys how to juggle with
two people?

382
00:23:34,977 --> 00:23:36,378
All right, I go, so let's go.

383
00:23:36,412 --> 00:23:38,614
This is a great thing. It goes really well
at parties.
