1
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:04,838
WOMEN ARE USUALLY
SMARTER THAN MEN,

2
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:06,940
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO
ORGANIZING THEIR CLOTHES,

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,276
WE COULD TEACH THEM A THING
OR TWO ABOUT HOW TO STORE
YOUR WARDROBE...

4
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,446
BY JUST THROWING
IT ON THE FLOOR.

5
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,948
YOU ALWAYS KNOW
WHERE EVERYTHING IS

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,018
AND IT SAVES WEAR AND TEAR
ON THE LINOLEUM.

7
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:20,920
BUT, EVEN THE MOST ORGANIZED GUY
COULD USE A LITTLE HELP.

8
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:22,589
SO, HERE'S WHAT YOU DO.

9
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:25,792
TAKE SOME DUCT TAPE AND
WIND IT ONTO A RAKE HANDLE.

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,062
SO, YOU'VE GOT
THE STICKY SIDE OUT.

11
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:32,532
GO DOWN THE RAKE AND
THROW IT ON THE FLOOR.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,735
NOW, WHEN YOU TAKE
OFF YOUR CLOTHES,

13
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,737
YOU THROW THEM ONTO
THE RAKE HANDLE.

14
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:40,206
AND, WHEN YOU'RE READY TO PUT ON
A SHIRT OR A PAIR OF PANTS,

15
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:43,009
YOU JUST STEP ON
THE END OF THE RAKE.

16
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,778
[laughter]

17
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:47,147
THEY USED TO CALL THIS
"DRESSING LIKE A RAKE."

18
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:50,417
IT'S THE RED GREEN SHOW!!!

19
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:53,753
HERE'S THE MAN
WHO'S BEHIND
THE MESSAGE,

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,521
BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL,

21
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:55,722
AND THE PAYMENTS.

22
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:56,990
YOUR HOST AND HERO:

23
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,591
RED GREEN!!!

24
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:03,630
[applause]

25
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,908
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
APPRECIATE IT.

26
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,277
BIG, BIG WEEK UP AT
THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

27
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:21,181
THE TOWN COUNCIL HAS DECIDED
THEY NEED A NEW MONUMENT
IN FRONT OF CITY HALL.

28
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:25,518
I'M GLAD THEY DECIDED
TO GET RID OF THAT OLD,
RUSTY TANK FROM THE WAR.

29
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,454
THAT THING SMELLS.

30
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,757
HAROLD, IF YOU
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH
RUSTY TANKS THAT SMELL,

31
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,693
THIS MAY NOT BE
THE TOWN FOR YOU.

32
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,963
THEY PUT OUT FOR TENDERS
ON THIS NEW MONUMENT.

33
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,666
I THINK WE'VE GOT A CHANCE
OF GETTING A NOD ON THIS DEAL.

34
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,302
THEY'RE HEARING THE PROPOSALS
IN THE NEXT HALF HOUR.

35
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:44,204
MAYBE WE SHOULD GET DOWN THERE.

36
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,238
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

37
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,639
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY?

38
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:48,374
BECAUSE I'VE GOT
A PROPOSAL, TOO.
OH, REALLY?

39
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,678
THEY WANT THE NEW MONUMENT
TO SIGNIFY THE LIFESTYLE
UP HERE.

40
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,246
THAT'S MY DRAWING.

41
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,648
I'VE GOT AN
ENTIRE FAMILY
IN A CANOE

42
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:57,584
AND THE SUNSHINE
SHINING ON THEM,

43
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,086
THE ANIMALS FROLICKING
ABOUT IN THE WOODS

44
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,788
AND A BABBLING BROOK.

45
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,357
HA! HA! HA!

46
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,092
WHAT'S YOUR DESIGN OF?

47
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,728
WE'RE DESIGNING
A 70-FOOT FLAGPOLE
MADE OUT OF BEER CANS

48
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,464
WITH A HUGE
UNEMPLOYMENT CHEQUE
FLYING OFF THE TOP.

49
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:14,701
[applause and laughter]

50
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,402
IN FACT, I'M GOING
TO MAKE THEM A DEAL.

51
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,971
IF THEY GIVE US
AN EXTRA WEEK,

52
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:20,306
WE CAN MAKE IT AN
80-FOOT FLAGPOLE.

53
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:29,182
IT'S TIME TO PLAY
"THE POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME."

54
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:33,153
TODAY'S PRIZE IS FOR ANYONE
WHO'S EVER DREAMT OF WAKING
UP A MILLIONAIRE:

55
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,221
AN ALARM CLOCK.

56
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:39,792
[laughter and applause]

57
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,761
PLAYING FOR THIS
WONDERFUL PRIZE

58
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,796
IS CITY SLICKER,
TURNED POSSUM LICKER:

59
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:47,700
MR. KEVIN BLACK.

60
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:52,539
MR. BLACK, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO GET MY UNCLE RED TO SAY
THE FOLLOWING WORD:

61
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,747
GO!!!

62
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,448
OKAY, PIECE OF CAKE.

63
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,816
BIRTHDAY.

64
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:08,755
I HAVEN'T
STARTED YET.

65
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:13,293
AH... MMM...MUMBLY BUMBLY,

66
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,596
FISH.
CHIPS.

67
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:17,797
RAW FISH.

68
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,199
BAIT.

69
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,733
NO, OKAY.

70
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,571
WHAT DO YOU CALL IT
WHEN YOU EAT RAW FISH?

71
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,139
INSANE.

72
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,041
[loud laughter]

73
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:31,377
A KIND OF BAR.

74
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:32,946
OPEN.

75
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:35,582
NO, A KIND OF BAR
YOU DON'T LIKE.

76
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,250
OH, CASH!

77
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:42,422
[laughter and applause]

78
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:45,391
WHEN YOU GO TO
A JAPANESE RESTAURANT,

79
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,626
WHAT DO YOU EAT?

80
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,695
I DON'T GO TO
A JAPANESE RESTAURANT.

81
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,563
I KNOW YOU DON'T,
BUT IF YOU DID,

82
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,065
WHAT WOULD YOU EAT?

83
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:53,766
PIZZA.

84
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,602
THEY DON'T
SERVE PIZZA.

85
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:58,605
NO, I BRING
IT WITH ME.

86
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,173
THEY DON'T LET YOU DO THAT.

87
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,708
THAT'S WHY I DON'T GO.

88
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:04,844
[applause]

89
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:09,282
YOU'RE ALMOST OUT
OF TIME, MR. BLACK.

90
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,818
REMEMBER THE TIME YOU WERE
FISHING IN MERCURY CREEK

91
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,319
AND YOU GOT THAT SOAKER?

92
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,787
OH, YEAH.

93
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,889
REMEMBER THE SOUND YOUR BOOT
MADE WHEN YOU WERE WALKING?

94
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,926
"SHOO-SHE!"

95
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,894
[ring! ring! ring!]

96
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,764
[applause]

97
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,737
YOU GUYS ARE
SO EMBARRASSING

98
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,639
WHEN YOU'RE YELLING AND
SCREAMING LIKE THAT.

99
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,507
I TOLD YOU THAT
THE TOWN COUNCIL

100
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,443
WASN'T GOING TO GO FOR
YOUR BEER CAN SCULPTURE.

101
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,045
MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THE ONE THEY WENT WITH.

102
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,680
FROM THOSE TWO GOOFBALLS.

103
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,181
THEY'RE NOT GOOFBALLS.

104
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:44,584
THEY'RE HEAD OF THEIR CLASS
AT THE ART COLLEGE.

105
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,853
OH BOY, OH BOY,
ART COLLEGE, EH?

106
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,922
THAT REALLY PREPARES YOU
FOR LIFE'S EMERGENCIES.

107
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,558
IMAGINE THE CAPTAIN OF A SHIP
GETTING EVERYBODY TOGETHER

108
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,794
AND SAYING: SHE'S
TAKING ON WATER,

109
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,329
THE ENGINES AREN'T RUNNING,

110
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,197
WE'VE LOST THE RADIO.

111
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,833
IS THERE
AN ART COLLEGE
GRADUATE HERE?

112
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:06,272
MAYBE YOU COULD DO SOME
CHARCOAL SKETCHES FOR US?

113
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,241
HA! HA! HA!

114
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,076
I HAPPEN TO LIKE ART
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

115
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,778
AND I LIKE
THEIR DESIGN, TOO.

116
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:13,980
IT WAS A STAINED
GLASS ABSTRACT WORK

117
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,649
AND IT WAS ALL FRAMED
IN WOOD AND COPPER.

118
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:20,453
IT WAS SIGNIFYING
THE ELEMENTAL OPENNESS
OF POSSUM LAKE.

119
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,257
NO, IT WAS SIGNIFYING
THE ELEMENTAL OPENNESS
OF THE TOWN COUNCIL WALLET.

120
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,059
NO, IT WASN'T.
YES, SIR!

121
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,227
THEY WON THAT TENDER
FAIR AND SQUARE.

122
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,296
ALL YOUR YELLING
AND SCREAMING

123
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,598
DIDN'T MAKE A BIT OF
A DIFFERENCE, DID IT?

124
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,667
ACTUALLY, IT DID.

125
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:38,504
OUR DEMONSTRATION
FORCED THEM TO GIVE US
COMPENSATION FOR LOSING.

126
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,840
WHAT KIND OF COMPENSATION?

127
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,543
HAROLD, THEY GAVE US
THE OLD ARMY TANK.

128
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:44,610
NO!
THEY GAVE IT TO US.

129
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,012
THE WHOLE TANK.

130
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,814
WE GOT THE TANK.

131
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,148
WHAT DO YOU
WANT THAT FOR?

132
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:52,485
THAT TANK DOESN'T RUN.
IT DOESN'T EVEN MOVE.

133
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:55,321
IT'S RUSTY AND
FULL OF HOLES
AND RODENTS.

134
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,723
IT'S A PIECE OF JUNK.

135
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,157
YOU JUST DON'T GET IT.

136
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,259
THIS IS ALL ABOUT
PRIDE OF OWNERSHIP.

137
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,328
PRIDE OF OWNERSHIP.

138
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,463
IF SOMEBODY
SAYS TO ME:

139
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,964
"DO YOU HAVE A TANK?"

140
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,632
I CAN SAY YES.

141
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,469
[laughter]

142
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,003
OKAY, BUT WHAT IF
THEY SAY TO YOU:

143
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,039
"WHY DO YOU HAVE A TANK?"

144
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:16,442
THE GUYS I HANG WITH
WOULD NEVER SAY WHY.

145
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,545
[laughter and applause]

146
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:26,219
YOU NEVER SEE A VAMPIRE
WITH A FULL-GROWN BEARD 

147
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:29,689
YET, A VAMPIRE CAN'T
SEE HIS REFLECTION 

148
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:33,192
SO, A LACK OF FACIAL HAIR
IS UNBELIEVABLY WEIRD 

149
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:36,829
'CAUSE SHAVING WOULD BE
OUT OF THE QUESTION 

150
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,200
IF YOU HAVE A TEENAGER
WHO HAS A DRIVER'S LICENSE,

151
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:44,137
THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT YOU
NEVER WANT YOUR KID TO
HAVE IN THE CAR

152
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:46,406
AND THEY'RE BOTH
CALLED ACCIDENTS.

153
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,741
SO, THIS WEEK ON
"HANDYMAN CORNER,"

154
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,943
WE'RE GOING TO
TEEN-PROOF THE CAR,

155
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,113
NOBODY IS GOING TO BE CALLING
YOU GRANDPA FOR AWHILE.

156
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,949
LET'S ADDRESS THE MAIN PROBLEM
RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

157
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,185
FROM NOW ON,

158
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,821
THIS BACK SEAT IS OUT OF BOUNDS.

159
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,025
OH, WAIT A MINUTE NOW.

160
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,961
A COMFORTABLE FRONT SEAT IS
JUST ASKING FOR TROUBLE.

161
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,897
IT'S GOT TO GO.

162
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:23,876
I THINK I'LL GO WITH SOMETHING
THAT'S PURELY FUNCTIONAL,

163
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,778
NOT COMFORTABLE AT ALL.

164
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:33,453
[laughter]

165
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,055
I'M THINKING CHURCH PEW.

166
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,224
I NEVER HAD ANY FUN
SITTING IN ONE OF THESE

167
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,594
AND I'M PRAYING THAT
NO ONE ELSE DOES EITHER.

168
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,798
GO WITH SOMETHING KIND OF
SPARTAN AND HARD.

169
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,967
MAYBE PRESBYTERIAN OR LUTHERAN.

170
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,502
IF YOUR KID COMPLAINS
ABOUT SLIVERS,

171
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,638
WELL, I'D SAY THERE'S
BEEN A SIN INVOLVED.

172
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:55,575
I'VE INSTALLED THESE METAL BARS

173
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:59,378
TO BLOCK THE ALTERNATE ROUTE
TO THE BACK SEAT.

174
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,247
I'M GOING TO BE TAKING OUT
THIS INTERIOR LIGHT

175
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,950
AND REPLACING IT WITH
A FLUORESCENT UNIT.

176
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,986
YOU KNOW HOW ATTRACTIVE EVERYONE
LOOKS UNDER A FLUORESCENT LIGHT.

177
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,855
AND ONE LAST THING.

178
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:13,359
I'VE TURNED THE RADIO ON
TO THE PUBLICLY FUNDED
"ALL NEWS STATION."

179
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:16,395
NOW, I'VE JUST GOT TO MAKE SURE
THAT NOBODY CAN EVER CHANGE
THE STATION.

180
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:22,768
THIS IS THE ONE MODIFICATION
THAT I'M MOST PROUD OF.

181
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,403
REMEMBER THAT CHEESY EXCUSE?

182
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,472
"SORRY DAD, WE RAN OUT OF GAS."

183
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,674
REMEMBER THAT, BERNICE?

184
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,276
BUT, NOT WITH THIS BABY.

185
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,844
NO WAY!

186
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:35,348
I'VE GOT 438 GALLONS
OF GAS IN THERE.

187
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:37,850
THOSE TEENS ARE GOING TO BE
DRIVING AROUND FOR SO LONG,

188
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:41,487
THEY'RE GOING TO FORGET WHAT
THEY'RE DRIVING AROUND FOR.

189
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:45,057
IF THIS PUT YOUR TEEN OFF ANY
KIND OF TRANSPORTATION FOREVER.

190
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,859
CONGRATULATIONS!

191
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,761
YOU'VE EXCEEDED
YOUR EXPECTATIONS.

192
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,229
SO, REMEMBER...

193
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,797
"IF THE WOMEN DON'T
FIND YOU HANDSOME,

194
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,499
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY."

195
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,940
WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE READY
FOR THE WORLD YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO LIVE IN.

196
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:04,043
I LOST THE COIN TOSS
LAST NIGHT AT THE LODGE.

197
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,211
HAD TO GO FOR COFFEE.

198
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,747
I DON'T MIND THAT.

199
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:09,749
I ENDED UP AT ONE OF THEM
"FANCY COFFEE PLACES."

200
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,884
"SUFFICIENT GROUNDS" WAS
THE NAME OF THE PLACE.

201
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,686
OR "HAS BEAN."

202
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,187
I'M NOT SURE.

203
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:18,658
I WALKED UP TO
"THE COFFEE SPECIALIST"
AND SAID TO HER:

204
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,293
GIVE ME SIX REGULAR,
THREE DOUBLE-DOUBLE,

205
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,661
AND ONE BLACK
WITH EIGHT SUGARS.

206
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,062
TO GO.

207
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,765
WELL, SHE LOOKS AT ME LIKE
A GOAT STARING AT A NEW FENCE.

208
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:28,000
"WHAT'S A REGULAR?" SHE SAYS.

209
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,569
WHAT'S A REGULAR, EH?

210
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,404
THIS AIN'T A GAS STATION.

211
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,638
WELL, EXCUSE ME.

212
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,440
I SAID: "WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?"

213
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:35,975
SHE GIVES ME THIS LIST:

214
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,210
LATTES, MOCHAS, CAPPUCCINOS.

215
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:41,914
SOUNDS LIKE THE GUEST LIST
AT AN ITALIAN WEDDING.

216
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:45,851
GIVE ME 10 CUPS OF SOMETHING
THAT'S SORT OF LIKE COFFEE.

217
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,922
SO, 30 MINUTES AND THE ENTIRE
ANNUAL COFFEE BUDGET LATER,

218
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:54,860
SHE HANDS ME TEN LITTLE CUPS,
LIKE, ABOUT THAT SIZE.

219
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,597
HOW CAN ANYTHING THAT SMALL
BE THAT EXPENSIVE?

220
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:01,734
AND HOW CAN ANYTHING CALLED
ESPRESSO TAKE A HALF HOUR?

221
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,337
WHEN I GOT BACK TO THE LODGE,
THE GUYS SAID TO ME:

222
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,072
"WHAT KEPT YOU?"

223
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,406
YOU KNOW WHAT I SAID?

224
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,275
"PROGRESS."

225
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,879
WE GOT THE OLD ARMY TANK
TOWED UP TO THE LODGE.

226
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,182
THAT WAS A JOB AND A HALF.

227
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:17,783
MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE
HIRED A GUY WITH A CRANE.

228
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,952
HE COULD HAVE LIFTED IT
ONTO A FLATBED TRUCK

229
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,253
AND DROVE IT RIGHT UP HERE.

230
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,591
AND MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE
BEEN BORN A MILLIONAIRE.

231
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,994
IT'S ALWAYS MONEY WITH YOU.

232
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,695
YOU NEED A TANK MOVED,
YOU PAY SOMEONE.

233
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,430
YOU NEED A ROOF RESHINGLED,
YOU PAY SOMEONE.

234
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,899
YOU NEED UNDERWEAR,
YOU PAY SOMEONE.

235
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,735
[laughter]

236
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,403
I JUST DON'T WORK THAT WAY.

237
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,372
AND WE GOT THE TANK HERE.

238
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,907
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER IF
THE TREADS WEREN'T SEIZED UP.

239
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,877
OR, IF SHE DIDN'T WEIGH 30 TON.

240
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,679
BUT, A FEW BLOWN TRANSMISSIONS

241
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,280
AND A COUPLE OF
BROKEN CHAINS LATER,

242
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:51,584
WE GOT 'ER DONE.

243
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,020
SO, YOU JUST DRAGGED IT
LIKE A BIG ROCK?

244
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:55,488
WOW! THAT'S NOT EASY.

245
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,523
THERE'S NO DIRECT PATH
FROM CITY HALL TO THE LODGE.

246
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,492
THERE IS NOW.

247
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:00,693
[laughter]

248
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,528
OKAY, OKAY.

249
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,130
YOU GOT YOURSELF A TANK.

250
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,665
NOW WHAT?

251
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:09,702
WELL, WE'VE GOT
A LAWN ORNAMENT THAT
NO ONE WILL EVER STEAL.

252
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,505
WE COULD USE IT
AS A STORAGE SHED.

253
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,640
OR MAYBE A CROCK POT.

254
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,709
[laughter]

255
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,944
A COUPLE OF THE GUYS WANT
TO SLEEP OVERNIGHT IN IT.

256
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,746
THAT SCARES ME A LITTLE.

257
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:21,814
I KNOW, I KNOW.

258
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,582
MAYBE, WE CAN USE IT
AS A TOURIST ATTRACTION.

259
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,552
THE BUSINESS CAN
BE USED UP HERE
AT THE LODGE.

260
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,522
BUT, WHAT KIND OF TOURIST
WOULD COME ALL THE WAY
TO SEE A TANK?

261
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,957
HEY, HEY, HEY!
GUYS LIKE ME.

262
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,592
[laughter]

263
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,094
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

264
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,462
FORGET IT.

265
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,132
ALL RIGHT, SETTLE DOWN.

266
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,801
AS YOU KNOW, IT'S
NEW MEMBER NIGHT.

267
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,370
HAP SHAUGHNESSEY HAS BROUGHT
IN A GUY TO SHOW US.

268
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,939
CAN'T WAIT TO
HEAR THIS ONE.

269
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,442
[laughter]

270
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:52,578
I'M GLAD TO SEE SO MANY
OF YOU CAME HERE TONIGHT.

271
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:56,348
NO DOUBT, YOU HEARD THAT
I WAS GOING TO NOMINATE
JACK BATTERSBY, HERE.

272
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,150
AND YOU HAD TO COME
SEE HIM IN PERSON.

273
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,019
WELL, I CAN'T SAY
AS I BLAME YA.

274
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:03,022
TO BE THIS CLOSE
TO GREATNESS.

275
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,724
OF COURSE,
I'M USED TO IT.

276
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,793
BEEN AROUND HIM SO LONG,
YOU COULD SAY I'M JADED.

277
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,962
IN CASE YOU'VE BEEN
HIDING UNDER A ROCK

278
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,831
THESE PAST 20 YEARS.

279
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,733
LET ME TELL YOU
ABOUT THIS MAN.

280
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:18,838
40 YEARS AGO,
WE WERE BARTENDERS
AT THIS CLUB IN LIVERPOOL

281
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:27,446
AND WE TOLD
THE CLUB'S MANAGER
TO HIRE THIS BAND,

282
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:31,183
THE BEATLES.

283
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,553
AFTER THAT "THE FAB FOUR"
WANTED US TO MANAGE THEM,

284
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,623
BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO GET
TIED DOWN TO ONE JOB

285
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,158
AND JACK HERE,

286
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,893
HE GOT AN OFFER TO
BE IN THE MOVIES.

287
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,495
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT,

288
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,064
BUT ALL THE HANDSOME MEN
IN HOLLYWOOD GOT TOGETHER

289
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,933
AND THEY BLACKLISTED HIM.

290
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,969
SO, HE'S BEEN
SPENDING HIS LIFE

291
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:56,709
BOUNCING AROUND THE WORLD
AS A FREELANCE GIGOLO
AND A PART-TIME SPY.

292
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,011
LIKE ME.

293
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,080
UNFORTUNATELY,
JACK DEVELOPED
SO MUCH CHARISMA,

294
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,682
THE LADIES WON'T
LEAVE HIM ALONE.

295
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,151
NOW YOU SEE,

296
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:08,254
I CAN TURN MY CHARISMA
OFF AND ON, LIKE THIS.

297
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,389
BUT, JACK HERE,

298
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,225
HE NEVER MASTERED THE ART.

299
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,861
SO, HE'S ALWAYS
ATTRACTIVE TO WOMEN.

300
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,897
THAT'S WHY HE WANTS TO
JOIN A LODGE FULL OF MEN,

301
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,765
SO THE WOMEN WILL
LEAVE HIM ALONE

302
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,334
AND HE CAN HAVE
SOME PEACE AND QUIET.

303
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:25,905
RIGHT, JACK?

304
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,207
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

305
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,612
OKAY GUYS, JACK IS
A FRIEND OF HAPS

306
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,715
AND SUPPOSED TO HAVE
DONE A LOT OF STUFF,

307
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,250
JUST LIKE HAP.

308
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,452
DO YOU WANT TO ADD
ANYTHING TO THIS, JACK?

309
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,588
NOT MUCH OF A TALKER?

310
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,191
UNLIKE HAP, HE'S NOT
MUCH OF A TALKER.

311
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,625
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

312
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:49,128
( Lodge members ):
AYE!!!

313
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:56,235
( Narrated by Red ):
THIS LOOKS LIKE TROUBLE.

314
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,938
OH BOY, YOU GOT
THE WHOLE SET UP.

315
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,307
GOOD LUCK.

316
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,043
[glass smashing]

317
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:06,545
INTERESTING START.

318
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,113
KEEP IT DOWN A BIT.

319
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,381
OH, GEEZ.

320
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,283
NO.

321
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:12,818
NO.

322
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:14,153
NO.

323
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,588
NO.

324
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:17,056
NO.

325
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:18,958
NO.

326
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,728
BILL, NO, NO, NO.

327
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,129
LET ME GIVE IT A SHOT.

328
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,397
DEAD CENTRE.

329
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,433
[glass smashing]

330
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:29,869
I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS
A WINDOW BACK THERE.

331
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,537
BILL, YOU NEED SOMETHING.

332
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:32,938
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED?

333
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,874
SOME STRAW.

334
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,709
WE'VE GOT A FEW BAILS OF STRAW.

335
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:39,011
GO GET SOME STRAW.

336
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,880
THAT'S NOT STRAW.

337
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:42,448
IS THERE STRAW IN
THE BACK OF THE VAN?

338
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,116
IS THAT WHAT'S HE DOING?

339
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,151
GETTING STRAW FROM
THE BACK OF THE VAN?

340
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,786
NO, NO, BILL, BILL.

341
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,488
BILL, NO, BILL.

342
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:53,125
EASY DOES IT.

343
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:56,428
YOU CANNOT THROW AN AXE
INTO A VAN, ESPECIALLY MINE.

344
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,097
NO, BILL.

345
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,366
I JUST WANT TO MOVE
ONE LITTLE THING.

346
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,234
I JUST WANT TO MAKE
ONE LITTLE CHANGE.

347
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,203
AN AXE WON'T STICK INTO A VAN.

348
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,406
THAT'S ONE OF THE LAWS
THAT I KEEP UP WITH.

349
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,942
NO, BILL, IT WON'T WORK.

350
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:13,212
OH, MY GOSH.

351
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,116
YOU KNOW, I STAND
CORRECTED ON THAT.

352
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,585
NOW, COME ON.

353
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:20,986
COME ON, NOW.

354
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:27,092
SURE, NOW HE GETS GOOD.

355
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,828
LOT OF TENSION THERE, BILL.

356
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,363
CAREFUL, CAREFUL.

357
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,098
I'M GOING TO OPEN THE DOOR.

358
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:34,633
I'M OPENING THE DOOR.

359
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,136
OH BOY, OH BOY.

360
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:39,004
I HOPE HE'S OKAY.

361
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,109
OH, HE'S FINE.

362
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,781
UNBELIEVABLE,
TOTALLY UNBELIEVABLE.

363
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,649
WE'VE GOT THE TANK RUNNING.

364
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:51,917
LISTEN TO THIS, HAROLD.

365
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,853
[loud sound of machinery]

366
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,523
Harold:
UNCLE RED, WHY CAN'T
YOU LEAVE THINGS ALONE?

367
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,959
THAT TANK WAS A PASSIVE,
DORMANT ORNAMENT.

368
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:02,861
NOW, IT'S LIKE A LOUD,
THREATENING EYESORE.

369
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:05,798
ACTUALLY, IT FITS
RIGHT IN, DOESN'T IT?

370
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,499
JUST OUR IDEA OF FUN.

371
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:08,701
WHO'S GOING TO GET HURT?

372
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:09,902
YOU ARE.

373
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,470
WELL, THEN IT'S NOT FUN.

374
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,339
BUT, IF ONE OF
THE OTHER GUYS GETS HURT
AND IT'S NOT TOO SERIOUS

375
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,442
THAT'S WHAT MAKES
LIFE WORTH LIVING.

376
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:20,279
THAT'S WHY MY GENERATION
IS MORE MATURE THAN
YOUR GENERATION,

377
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,982
CONCERNING COMMON
SENSE AND SAFETY.

378
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,284
YOUR GENERATION HAS
TATTOOS ON THEIR BUTTS

379
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,786
AND STOVE BOLTS
THROUGH THEIR NOSES.

380
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:28,787
COME ON, HAROLD.

381
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,189
GO GRAB YOUR VIDEO CAMERA

382
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,724
AND WE'RE GOING TO
CAPTURE A SPECIAL MOMENT.

383
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,158
WHAT SPECIAL MOMENT?

384
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,027
49 LODGE MEMBERS
IN A TANK?

385
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,062
THERE WILL BE
A SPECIAL MOMENT.

386
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,333
WELCOME TO
"THE EXPERTS."

387
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,335
THE PART OF THE SHOW
WHERE WE EXAMINE

388
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,804
THE THREE LITTLE WORDS
THAT MEN FIND SO HARD TO SAY:

389
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:48,040
[studio audience]:
I DON'T KNOW!!!

390
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,776
THAT'S A TRUISM,
ISN'T IT?

391
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,912
JOINING MY UNCLE RED
IS HIS BEST FRIEND IN
THE WHOLE WIDE ROOM:

392
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:57,082
THE OWNER AND PROPRIETOR
OF THE LIVE BAIT SHOP

393
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,817
MR. EARL BATTERSBY.

394
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:02,921
[applause]

395
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,524
THANK YOU, HAROLD.

396
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,226
AND MAY I ADD,

397
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:09,261
WE HAVE A NEW
"DRIVE-THRU WINDOW"

398
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,829
TO HELP US SERVE

399
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:13,232
ALL YOUR LIVE BAIT NEEDS.

400
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,501
[laughter]

401
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,636
IS THAT WORKING OUT
FOR YOU, EARL?

402
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,637
OH, YEAH.

403
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,373
BUT, WE HAD TO GO TO CONTAINERS.

404
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:27,479
PEOPLE FEEL A LITTLE UNEASY
DRIVING THROUGH A SCHOOL ZONE
WITH A LAPFUL OF FROGS.

405
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:31,083
REALLY?

406
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,018
THE LETTER GOES:

407
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,854
"DEAR EXPERTS:"

408
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:39,124
"I HAVE A TWIN BROTHER AND
WE SEEM TO ALWAYS KNOW WHAT
THE OTHER IS THINKING."

409
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:42,995
"ESPECIALLY,
WHEN WE'RE AROUND
GOOD LOOKING WOMEN."

410
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,465
IS THIS A MENTAL CONDITION
BECAUSE WE'RE TWINS?

411
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:50,903
P.S., MY BROTHER
WANTS TO KNOW, TOO.

412
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,605
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH TWINS.

413
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,141
MENTAL TELEPATHY IS A POWER
THAT EVERYONE HAS,

414
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,877
BUT FEW PEOPLE EXERCISE IT.

415
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:01,547
I NEVER KNOW WHAT
PEOPLE ARE THINKING.

416
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:05,017
I NEVER CARE WHAT
PEOPLE ARE THINKING.

417
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:09,354
THEY DID A STUDY THAT
FOUND 30% OF PEOPLE
CAN READ MINDS.

418
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,990
CAN I SEE THIS
STUDY, EARL?

419
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:13,926
NO, I DON'T HAVE THE STUDY.

420
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,661
BUT, I HEARD IT FROM A GUY,

421
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:19,631
WHO HEARD IT FROM A GUY,
WHO HEARD IT FROM A GUY.

422
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,066
NO, IT'S TRUE.

423
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:24,536
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE
TO READ PEOPLE'S MINDS.

424
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,338
I WANT YOU TO
READ HAROLD'S MIND.

425
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,973
IT SHOULDN'T TAKE LONG.

426
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,776
[laughter]

427
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,044
OKAY, HAROLD.

428
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,413
I WANT YOU TO THINK OF A NUMBER
BETWEEN ONE AND TEN.

429
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,448
I WILL WRITE SOMETHING
ON THIS PIECE OF PAPER

430
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:39,184
AND WE'LL SEE IF IT'S CORRECT.

431
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:47,192
[laughter]

432
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,928
Earl:
ALL RIGHT, I GOT IT.

433
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:52,764
( Groaning in pain )

434
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:56,335
[laughter]

435
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:58,303
HAROLD, WHAT NUMBER
WERE YOU THINKING OF?

436
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,305
THE NUMBER THREE.

437
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:03,408
I WAS GOING TO PICK SEVEN,
BUT I THOUGHT HE'LL
GET ME ON SEVEN.

438
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,777
SO, I WENT TO SIX,
BUT I THOUGHT,

439
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:08,013
I'M GOING TO GO BIG
AT A TIME LIKE THIS.

440
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,848
BUT, TEN'S NOT BETWEEN
ONE AND TEN.

441
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,351
SO, YOU PICKED THREE?

442
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:15,087
RED, WHAT'S ON THE PAPER?

443
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,922
THIS SHOULD BE GOOD.

444
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,427
[laughter]

445
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,897
WOW!

446
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:30,202
[applause]

447
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,807
( Shouting )
I THINK WE'RE BACK
TO THE WAY WE WERE

448
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,809
AT THE START OF THE SHOW.

449
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:42,548
[laughter]

450
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:44,616
( Shouting )
TANKS ARE LOUD!!!

451
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,985
[laughter]

452
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:50,022
YOU KNOW WHAT HAROLD,
TANKS ARE LOUD!!!

453
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:53,292
LOUD!

454
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:57,162
WHY WERE YOU
INSIDE THE TANK?

455
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:58,697
I WANTED TO GET
A "P.O.V. SHOT."

456
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,999
WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE
FROM INSIDE THE TANK.

457
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,001
BUT YOU'RE A JOURNALIST,
YOU'RE AN OBSERVER.

458
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,469
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO TOUCH THINGS.

459
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,638
WELL, I ASKED SOMEBODY:
"WHAT'S THIS BUTTON FOR?"

460
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,940
BUT, NOBODY ANSWERED.

461
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,675
WE COULDN'T HEAR YOU.

462
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,343
WHEN YOU'RE KNOCKING
BUILDINGS OVER,

463
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,779
THERE'S A LOT OF
RACKET GOING ON.

464
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:17,583
I WOULDN'T HAVE TOUCHED IT
IF I KNEW IT WAS LOADED.

465
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,551
I MEAN, WHY
WAS IT LOADED?

466
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:20,953
WELL, IT WASN'T
REALLY LOADED.

467
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,688
EDGAR THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE MORE AUTHENTIC

468
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:26,858
IF WE HAD A THERMOS
FULL OF DYNAMITE DROPPED
INTO THE CHAMBER, THERE.

469
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,627
I MEAN, WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

470
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,829
WHAT ARE THE ODDS?
WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

471
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,998
THAT THE CANNON
WOULD ACTUALLY FIRE?

472
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,435
WHAT ARE THE ODDS
THAT IT WOULD BE AIMED
AT THE "NEW" TOWN MONUMENT?

473
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,503
[loud laughter]

474
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,005
I TELL YA...

475
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,075
GLASS AND COPPER IS NO MATCH
FOR AN EXPLODING THERMOS.

476
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:44,910
I JUST FEEL FOR
THOSE STUDENTS.

477
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,645
THEY WORKED SO HARD
ON THAT THING.

478
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:47,846
HAROLD, THEY'RE
IN ART COLLEGE.

479
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,681
THEY LOVE REJECTION.

480
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,183
BUT, THERE'S LEGAL
RAMIFICATIONS.

481
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,418
WE LOST THEM THEIR
NEW MONUMENT.

482
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:54,753
NO, NO, NO.

483
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,021
YOU KNOW WHAT I DID?

484
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,323
I GAVE THEM BACK
THE TANK, HAROLD.

485
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,226
THEY WON'T SUE US BECAUSE
WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING.

486
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,029
I LOVE THAT ABOUT US.

487
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,064
[squeal of the Possum]

488
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,033
IT'S MEETING TIME.
YOU GO AHEAD.

489
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,402
I'LL BE DOWN
IN A MINUTE.

490
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,571
YOU GO AHEAD.

491
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,006
TANKS ARE LOUD!

492
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:15,574
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

493
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,242
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

494
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:20,012
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED
WITH THE TANK THING.

495
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:21,713
SO, WE HAD A BIT OF A D-DAY

496
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,449
AND I'M HOPING TONIGHT
IS THE "DE NIGHT."

497
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:25,951
AND TO THE REST OF YOU:

498
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,819
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

499
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,656
ON BEHALF MYSELF AND HAROLD
AND THE GANG UP AT THE LODGE.

500
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,991
"KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE."

501
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:36,261
[applause]

502
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,406
ALL RISE.

503
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:55,280
[lodge members]:
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI.

504
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,149
I WAS ASKED TO MAKE
ONE ANNOUNCEMENT.

505
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:59,851
I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY,
I'M FORMALLY APOLOGIZING

506
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:02,020
FOR FIRING THE CANNON
ON THE TANK.

507
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,588
I AM VERY ASHAMED.

508
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,424
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS DOING

509
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,460
AND I TAKE NO PLEASURE IN
THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY DAMAGE
THAT I CAUSED.

510
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,562
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO
EXTEND MY CONDOLENCES

511
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,198
TO THE ART STUDENTS
WHO BUILT THE MONUMENT

512
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:16,635
THAT I, AND I ALONE, DESTROYED.

513
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:19,805
BUT, DID YOU SEE
THAT BABY GO DOWN?

514
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,411
BUT, I AM SORRY.

515
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:29,414
