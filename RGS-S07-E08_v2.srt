00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:11,177
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW!"

2
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,313
AND NOW HERE'S A MAN WHO'S A
RIDDLE WRAPPED IN AN ENIGMA

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,481
WEARING SUSPENDERS.

4
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:15,648
YOUR HOST,
YOUR HERO,
MY UNCLE,

5
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:17,650
RED GR-E-E-E-N!

6
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:32,332
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

7
00:00:32,398 --> 00:00:35,135
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

8
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,936
I THINK YOU SHOULD ALL
SWITCH BACK TO WATER.

9
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,471
OKAY!

10
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,874
BIG, BIG WEEK UP AT
THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

11
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,544
I'M THINKING ABOUT MAKING A
LITTLE REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT,
GETTING MYSELF A LITTLE
PIECE OF PROPERTY.

12
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:49,949
I'M THINKING ABOUT BUYING THAT
CHUNK OF LAND THAT FUZZY NORTON
HAS FOR SALE DOWN BY THE
MERCURY CREEK BRIDGE.

13
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:52,385
UNCLE RED,
THAT'S NOT LAND.

14
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:55,588
OH, NO,
LAND IS DRY,

15
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:57,223
AND LAND IS OFTEN
TIMES SQUARE.

16
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,459
THAT'S TRIANGULAR
AND --

17
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,761
WELL, IT'S TRIANGULAR
AND IT'S WET.

18
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:04,797
IT'S LIKE A BIG DIAPER.

19
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:06,666
SMELLS LIKE ONE TOO.
YOU GOT TO --

20
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,902
NOW, HAROLD, DON'T
GET EXCITED HERE.

21
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:10,370
IT'S A FREE MARKET.

22
00:01:10,436 --> 00:01:12,472
FUZZY WANTS TO SELL,
AND I WANT TO BUY.

23
00:01:12,538 --> 00:01:15,408
WHY? YOU CAN'T
BUILD ON IT.

24
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:17,310
YOU CAN'T EVEN
PARK ON IT.

25
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,313
ANYTHING OVER 200 POUNDS SINKS
RIGHT TO THE BOTTOM.

26
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,315
THERE GOES 90% OF THE LODGE
MEMBERS RIGHT THERE.

27
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:23,883
AND SO...

28
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,185
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I GUESS THEN, HAROLD,

29
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:29,322
EITHER I HAVE A
PLAN, OR I'M AN IDIOT.

30
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:32,592
WELL, GOOD. OKAY.

31
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,327
BECAUSE USUALLY YOU HAVE A PLAN,
AND YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

32
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:35,695
BUT THIS WAY --

33
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,731
EASY. EASY.
EASY. EASY.

34
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,303
YOU KNOW WHAT THE WORD
"EXPROPRIATION" MEANS, HAROLD?
DID YOU EVER HEAR THAT ONE?

35
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,140
YES, I HEARD OF IT,
AND I DO KNOW
WHAT IT MEANS.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

36
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:49,509
OH, YOU WANT TO KNOW?
OH, OKAY. IT MEANS --

37
00:01:49,575 --> 00:01:51,911
WELL, IT'S, LIKE, IF THE
GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO BUY
YOUR PROPERTY TO, LIKE,

38
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:54,447
PUT UP A PARK OR SOMETHING
LIKE THAT -- A PARK OR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

39
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,549
HOW ABOUT FOR A
HIGHWAY, HAROLD?

40
00:01:56,616 --> 00:02:00,086
OH, YEAH. RIGHT. LIKE, THE
GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO BUILD
A HIGHWAY THAT'S, LIKE,

41
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:02,722
TRIANGULAR AND FLOODS AND SINKS.

42
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,624
WELL, SOMETHING
LIKE THAT, HAROLD.

43
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,926
BUT, HEY, YOU AND I ARE THE
ONLY ONES IN THE AREA
THAT KNOW ABOUT IT.

44
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:08,494
YOU KNOW WHAT
I MEAN?
YEAH.

45
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:11,097
WELL, I'M WILLING TO
FORGET IT IF YOU ARE.

[QUIRKY UPBEAT MUSIC]

47
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,116
HERE'S A FEW SELECTED CLIPS
FROM THIS WEEK'S SHOW,

48
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,885
AND THESE ARE THE
HIGHLIGHTS, FOLKS.

49
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,387
OH, BOY, A LITTLE
BIT OF EVERYTHING.

50
00:02:34,453 --> 00:02:36,656
SOMETHING FOR THE
WHOLE FAMILY HERE.

51
00:02:36,722 --> 00:02:38,424
I'M NOT SURE I WANT
TO MEET THAT FAMILY.

52
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,425
IT'S A GOOD SHOW.

53
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,027
THIS IS PRICELESS!

54
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,335
FOR ANYBODY WHO CAN
REMEMBER WHO HE IS,

55
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:54,574
WOULD YOU PLEASE ATTEND AND
EXPRESS OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES?

56
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,977
OKAY. LOST AND FOUND...

57
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:01,147
OKAY. HAROLD, I'M GETTING REAL
CLOSE ON THIS REAL ESTATE DEAL.

58
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,915
I'VE GOT FUZZY DOWN TO $400.

59
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,684
WOW! HOW MUCH
WAS HE ASKING?

60
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,119
$400.

61
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,522
BUT, YOU KNOW, I TELL YOU, THE
PLACE HAS BEEN FOR SALE SO LONG,

62
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,857
HE WAS THINKING OF
RAISING THE PRICE.

63
00:03:11,924 --> 00:03:14,260
FUZZY'S NOT TOO SWIFT, YOU KNOW?

64
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:17,530
WELL, HE WAS SWIFT
ENOUGH TO SELL YOU
A SINKHOLE FOR $400.

65
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:20,700
OH, NOT JUST ME. I'VE GOT
PARTNERS, HAROLD.

66
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:23,502
I REALLY COULDN'T COME
UP WITH THE $400
ALL ON MY OWN,

67
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:25,371
SO THERE'S 85 OF US,

68
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:28,874
AND WE KICKED
IN $5 A PIECE.

69
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,515
THERE'S 85, AND YOU PUT
$5 IN TO MAKE $400?

70
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:41,520
BOY, YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT
MATH, UNCLE RED.

71
00:03:41,587 --> 00:03:43,789
OH, NO, NO, HAROLD.
THEY'RE NOT VERY
GOOD AT MATH.

72
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,958
I'M UP $25.

OH, HAVING RESPECT
FOR NATURE

75
00:03:53,332 --> 00:03:55,367
IS A SPORT THAT'S
ALWAYS IN SEASON

76
00:03:55,434 --> 00:03:57,403
LIKE WHEN SOMETHING
IS CALLED A STINK BUG

77
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,505
THERE'S PROBABLY A
PRETTY GOOD REASON

78
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,540
WHEN YOU STEP
ON A STINK BUG

79
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:03,609
IT'S NOT LIKE A
SLUG OR SNAIL

80
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,611
THAT'S WHY MY
EYES ARE WATERING

81
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:08,514
AND THAT'S WHY MY
SHOES ARE FOR SALE

NO, ARNIE, BEING A CONTORTIONIST
IS NOT A SPECIAL ABILITY.

ON A ROOF IN THAT AREA, RED.

BREAST IMPLANTS?

105
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,287
NO, NO, WHEN PEOPLE
FIND OUT YOU'RE A SINGER,

106
00:05:22,354 --> 00:05:23,555
THEY SAY YOU
MUST HAVE...

107
00:05:23,622 --> 00:05:25,924
THICK SKIN.

108
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:27,626
YOU KNOW THE
GRAMMY AWARDS, OKAY?

109

THIS WEEK ON HANDYMAN CORNER,

120
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,723
I WAS GONNA SHOW YOU HOW TO
MAKE A CATAPULT OUT OF ONE
OF THEM HIDEAWAY BEDS

121
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,526
TO HELP GET YOUR TEENAGERS
UP IN THE MORNING.

122
00:06:00,592 --> 00:06:01,693
BUT ON THE WAY OVER HERE,

123
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,663
I WAS PASSED BY A RED
CONVERTIBLE SPORTS CAR,

124
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,266
AND THE WOMAN DRIVING IT
HAD THE TOP DOWN...

125
00:06:07,332 --> 00:06:08,734
ON THE CAR.

126
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,069
AND I SAID, MAN, WOULD I
LOVE TO HAVE ONE OF THOSE --

127
00:06:11,136 --> 00:06:12,738
THE CONVERTIBLE, THAT IS.

128
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,841
OH, YEAH, LOVE THE FEEL
OF WIND IN MY HAT.

129
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,977
BUT I HATE TO GIVE UP THE
ROOMINESS AND SAFETY OF A VAN

130
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:22,848
TO RIDE AROUND IN SOMETHING THE
SIZE OF ONE OF THEM KIDDIE
RIDES AT THE SUPERMARKET.

131
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:25,417
SO INSTEAD, THIS WEEK
ON HANDYMAN CORNER,

132
00:06:25,484 --> 00:06:29,655
I'M GOING TO TURN THE POSSUM
VAN INTO A CONVERTIBLE.

133
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:31,323
I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY
HOW I'M GOING TO DO IT,

134
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,759
BUT I'LL FIGURE OUT A WAY.

135
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:38,230
YEAH, I COULD --

136
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:39,665
NOPE.

137
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:43,035
I WAS GOING TO MAKE A
CONVERTIBLE OUT OF
THE POSSUM VAN,

138
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:45,437
JUST CUT THE ROOF
OFF OR SOMETHING.

139
00:06:45,504 --> 00:06:47,205
THEN I THOUGHT, "WAIT A SEC,

140
00:06:47,272 --> 00:06:51,076
"WHAT IF SOMETHING GOES
HORRIBLY WRONG, AND I RUIN
MY FAVOURITE VEHICLE?"

141
00:06:51,143 --> 00:06:52,844
AND THEN I GOT AN IDEA,
A BRAINSTORM.

142
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:54,246
IT JUST HIT ME.

143
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:58,717
HEY, PORKY LANSFORD HAS A VAN,
AND HE LOVES CONVERTIBLES,

144
00:06:58,784 --> 00:07:00,953
ESPECIALLY IF HE CAN
GET ONE FOR FREE.

145
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:02,220
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?

146
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:05,324
IT'LL BE A SURPRISE.

147
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,292
WHAT I'VE DONE HERE IS
I'VE GOT THIS MODEL.

148
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:08,760
THIS IS ONE OF
HAROLD'S, ACTUALLY,

149
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:10,595
AND I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT
I'VE GOT IN MIND.

150
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:27,079
(MUMBLING)

151
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:28,347
AND THAT SHOULD WORK GREAT.

152
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:30,782
NOW TO DO THE CUTTIN',

153
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:34,019
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU
NEED SOMETHING HEAVIER
THAN A HACKSAW,

154
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:37,556
UNLESS YOU RECENTLY RETIRED AND
ARE LOOKING FOR SOME WAY
TO FILL UP YOUR DAYS.

155
00:07:37,622 --> 00:07:40,292
BUT I WOULD SAY GO
WITH A TORCH ON THAT,

156
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:42,928
AND IF YOU DON'T
HAVE A TORCH, WELL...

157
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:44,096
I'D SAY GET ONE!

158
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:50,535
JUST GET IT GOOD AND HOT,
AND START CUTTING.

159
00:07:52,604 --> 00:07:55,574
ALL RIGHT. I MADE ALL THE CUTS.

160
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,377
OH! PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE USED
THE HACKSAW ON THIS,

161
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:01,012
BUT IT WAS JUST A TEST.

162
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,048
IT'LL WORK A LOT
BETTER ON THE VAN.

163
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,989
ALMOST.
ALMOST THROUGH.

164
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:16,261
ALL RIGHT. NOW, IF YOU
DON'T WANT THE SMOKE,

165
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:18,964
CLEAN THE VAN OUT FIRST.

166
00:08:20,398 --> 00:08:23,301
ALL RIGHT. WE GOT OURSELVES
A CONVERTIBLE NOW.

167
00:08:23,368 --> 00:08:25,503
JUST TO TURN IT BACK
INTO A HARDTOP,

168
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,473
WE'VE GOT TO CUT THIS UP
A LITTLE BIT MORE AND PUT
SOME HINGES ON THE SIDE HERE.

169
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,342
YOU CAN PUT SOME REGULAR
HINGES ON THERE,

170
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:33,879
BUT I WOULD RECOMMEND THE
HANDYMAN'S SECRET WEAPON,

171
00:08:33,945 --> 00:08:35,046
DUCT TAPE.

172
00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:40,485
ALL RIGHT. WE GOT OUR
SECTIONS ALL IN PLACE NOW.

173
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:43,521
NOW WE NEED SOME KIND OF
A MECHANISM TO RAISE
AND LOWER THE ROOF.

174
00:08:43,588 --> 00:08:45,190
AND FOR THAT YOU
NEED THREE THINGS...

175
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:49,561
A 2 X 4, A CAR JACK
AND GRADE 10 PHYSICS.

176
00:08:49,628 --> 00:08:53,098
WHAT YOU DO IS YOU TAKE THE
2 X 4 AND YOU LAY IT ON
THE CAR JACK, SEE?

177
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:55,300
AND THEN WHAT YOU DO IS YOU GET
THE THING NEAR THE CENTRE
OF THE FULCRUM --

178
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:56,901
OR THE POSITION OF THE FORCE,

179
00:08:56,968 --> 00:09:00,338
AND THEN WHEN YOU JACK UP THE
CAR, THEN YOU'LL RAISE THE ROOF.

180
00:09:00,405 --> 00:09:02,340
LET'S GIVE HER A TRY.

181
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:07,545
ALL RIGHT. IT LOOKS
LIKE IT'S GONNA RAIN

182
00:09:07,612 --> 00:09:09,147
IN ANOTHER COUPLE OF WEEKS,

183
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:12,417
SO WHY DON'T WE JUST JACK
IT UP AND RAISE THE ROOF?

184
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:17,689
OH, LOOK AT THAT BABY GO!

185
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:19,724
YEP.

186
00:09:21,493 --> 00:09:24,629
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

187
00:09:30,535 --> 00:09:34,005
SO, REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

188
00:09:34,072 --> 00:09:36,875
WELL, GET A CONVERTIBLE.

189
00:09:36,941 --> 00:09:37,976
I WONDER WHEN THE
STORM'S GONNA HIT?

190
00:09:41,513 --> 00:09:43,348
I GUESS IT BLEW OVER.

191
00:09:48,887 --> 00:09:51,756
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
OLDER GUYS WHO HAVE MORE
MILES ON YOUR ODOMETER

192
00:09:51,823 --> 00:09:55,326
THAN YOU HAVE LEFT
ON YOUR WARRANTY.

193
00:09:55,393 --> 00:09:58,296
MAYBE SOME OF YOU ARE THINKING
THAT ONE DAY SOON,

194
00:09:58,363 --> 00:10:01,733
WELL, YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO
SLEEP AND NOT SNORE...

195
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,639
EVER AGAIN.

196
00:10:07,705 --> 00:10:12,977
NOW, I'M TALKING ABOUT SHUFFLING
OFF THIS MORTAL COIL AND TAKING
THE BIG DIRT NAP.

197
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:16,347
AND SOME OF YOU
ARE PROBABLY THINKING,

198
00:10:16,414 --> 00:10:18,750
"YOU KNOW, MAYBE I SHOULD START
GOING TO CHURCH AGAIN."

199
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:23,288
YOU KNOW, KIND OF BUILD UP YOUR
CREDIT AND PAY YOUR ENTRANCE
FEE INTO THE PEARLY GATES,

200
00:10:23,354 --> 00:10:25,557
THAT KIND OF THING.

201
00:10:25,623 --> 00:10:27,492
YOU USED TO GO TO CHURCH
ALL THE TIME.

202
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:32,530
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT THAT THE
BEST GOLFING AND FISHING
TIME IS SUNDAY MORNING.

203
00:10:32,597 --> 00:10:33,898
AND NOW YOU'RE WORRIED THAT

204
00:10:33,965 --> 00:10:36,968
GOD, BEING ALL POWERFUL
AND ALL KNOWING,

205
00:10:37,035 --> 00:10:38,736
MAYBE HE'S NOT GOING TO LET
YOU BACK INTO THE FLOCK

206
00:10:38,803 --> 00:10:42,807
SINCE YOU STRAYED FOR
FIVE DECADES OR SO.

207
00:10:42,874 --> 00:10:44,909
BUT THAT'S THE GREAT
THING ABOUT GOD.

208
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:46,377
HE'LL FORGIVE YOU.

209
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:50,815
IT'S NEVER TOO LATE.
IT IS NEVER TOO LATE.

210
00:10:50,882 --> 00:10:54,919
SO NO RUSH TO GO BACK TO CHURCH.

211
00:10:54,986 --> 00:10:58,823
I SAY, WAIT UNTIL YOU'RE
TOO OLD TO GOLF OR FISH.

212
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:03,661
IT IS NEVER TOO LATE!

213
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:07,465
PERSONALLY, I'M PLANNING
ON A DEATHBED THING.

214
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:09,434
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

215
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,869
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

216
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:20,378
NOW, I GOT THE DEED
ALL SIGNED OVER,

217
00:11:20,445 --> 00:11:23,247
SO THAT LAND IS OFFICIALLY OURS.

218
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:24,282
WELL, UNCLE RED,

219
00:11:24,348 --> 00:11:25,750
I HEARD THERE IS
NO HIGHWAY COMING THROUGH.

220
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:29,120
I HEARD THAT YOU DREAMED
THIS WHOLE THING UP.

221
00:11:29,954 --> 00:11:32,023
THIS BIG SCHEME OF YOURS
IS SUPPOSED TO BE WHAT
HAPPENS TO A PERSON

222
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:35,059
AFTER THEY HAVE 50 YEARS OF
UNATTENDED HEAD INJURIES.

223
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:39,230
NO, HAROLD, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THAT RUMOUR.

224
00:11:39,297 --> 00:11:40,131
DOESN'T BOTHER ME A BIT.

225
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:41,065
YOU KNOW WHY?
WHY?

226
00:11:41,132 --> 00:11:43,134
I STARTED IT, HAROLD!

227
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:45,837
I'M JUST TRYING TO COOL OFF
MY REAL ESTATE PARTNERS.

228
00:11:45,903 --> 00:11:46,838
WELL, IT WORKED.

229
00:11:46,904 --> 00:11:48,239
I HEARD THEY WERE
GOING TO SUE YOU.

230
00:11:48,306 --> 00:11:50,107
THE ONLY REASON THEY BACKED OFF,
THOUGH, IS BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT,

231
00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:52,677
YOU KNOW, THE LEGAL FEES COULD
CUT INTO THEIR $5 CLAIM.

232
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:55,880
NONE OF THAT MATTERS,
HAROLD, OKAY?

233
00:11:55,947 --> 00:11:57,515
I OFFERED TO GIVE THE
GUYS THEIR MONEY BACK,

234
00:11:57,582 --> 00:11:59,450
AND THEY ACCEPTED, OKAY?

235
00:11:59,517 --> 00:12:01,719
SO FROM NOW ON,
THE PROPERTY,
AND THE PROFIT
WHEN I SELL IT,

236
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:03,221
WILL BE ALL MINE.

237
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:05,389
WELL, HOW COME IF YOU CAN
AFFORD TO PAY THEM ALL BACK,

238
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:06,991
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST BUY THE LAND
ON YOUR OWN THE FIRST TIME?

239
00:12:07,058 --> 00:12:08,926
BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO PAY
FOR THE LAND TODAY.

240
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:12,496
THE REFUNDS TO THE
GUYS CAN BE DEFERRED.

241
00:12:13,931 --> 00:12:15,333
THAT'S HIGH FINANCE, HAROLD.

242
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,734
THAT'S BEYOND YOU.

243
00:12:16,801 --> 00:12:17,969
OH, YEAH, I THINK
I GOT IT.

244
00:12:18,035 --> 00:12:19,637
YOU WANT TO SIT AROUND AND DO
NOTHING AND MAKE MONEY,

245
00:12:19,704 --> 00:12:22,306
BUT YOU DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY
ELSE HOARDING IN ON IT.

246
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:25,009
YEAH, THAT'S PRETTY
MUCH IT. YEP.

247
00:12:25,076 --> 00:12:26,944
HEY, WHERE DID YOU GET
SO SMART ABOUT MONEY?

248
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:28,980
I WATCH THAT
SHOW "TRADERS."

249
00:12:29,046 --> 00:12:36,754
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

250
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:40,024
I'M TOTALLY ASHAMED OF YOUR
GREED -- I'M JUST SAYING.

251
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:43,227
WELL, FINE, HAROLD.

252
00:12:43,294 --> 00:12:44,996
GIVE ME $200, AND I'LL CUT YOU
IN FOR HALF THE PROFIT.

253
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:46,464
NO, THANK YOU!

254
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,531
THERE'S GOING TO BE NO HIGHWAY;

255
00:12:47,598 --> 00:12:49,667
THEREFORE, THERE WILL
BE NO PROFIT.

256
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:52,837
WELL, THEN HOW CAN THAT
POSSIBLY MAKE ME GREEDY?

257
00:12:56,507 --> 00:12:58,275
YOU'RE AMAZING, UNCLE RED.

258
00:12:58,342 --> 00:13:02,346
YOU'RE TAKING SELFISHNESS TO
THE POINT WHERE IT ACTUALLY
HELPS PEOPLE.

259
00:13:03,981 --> 00:13:05,916
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TEENAGERS
ABOUT SETTING A GOOD EXAMPLE.

260
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:08,319
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

261
00:13:08,386 --> 00:13:11,188
OH, YEAH. YOU'RE SETTING
AN EXAMPLE FOR A VERY
IMPRESSIONABLE AND
VULNERABLE GROUP

262
00:13:11,255 --> 00:13:13,624
WHO WANT TO DRESS
LIKE YOU AND ACT LIKE YOU;

263
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:15,393
NAMELY, ADULTS.

264
00:13:16,994 --> 00:13:18,996
NOW, SEE, ADULTS CAN'T ADMIT
THEY'RE OVER THE HILL.

265
00:13:19,063 --> 00:13:20,798
THEY WANT TO BE YOUNG AGAIN.

266
00:13:20,865 --> 00:13:22,867
BECAUSE THEY REALIZE HOW
BADLY THEY BLEW IT THE
FIRST TIME AROUND,

267
00:13:22,933 --> 00:13:24,935
THEY WANT A SECOND CHANCE.

268
00:13:25,002 --> 00:13:27,772
THEY FIGURE AS LONG AS THEY
DRESS LIKE TEENAGERS AND
ACT LIKE TEENAGERS,

269
00:13:27,838 --> 00:13:31,442
NOBODY'LL NOTICE THAT THEY'RE
OLD AND WRINKLED AND OUT OF IT.

270
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:35,546
YOU GUYS STARTED WEARING THE
SPANDEX; SO DID ADULTS.

271
00:13:35,613 --> 00:13:41,652
YESTERDAY, I SAW A 250-POUND
JOGGER LOOK LIKE A 3-D NEON MAP
OF THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA,

272
00:13:42,486 --> 00:13:44,855
AND BOSNIA WAS
INFRINGING ON SERBIA.

273
00:13:46,357 --> 00:13:50,494
YOU TEENAGERS STARTED WEARING
THE PLATFORM SHOES AND THE
POLYESTER CLOTHES,

274
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:54,865
NOW THE ADULTS ARE GETTING OUT
THEIR OLD FLOWER POWER T-SHIRTS
AND BELL BOTTOM JEANS.

275
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:59,069
AND AT THIS POINT, THE BOTTOMS
ARE A LOT BIGGER THAN THE BELLS.

276
00:13:59,136 --> 00:14:01,505
SO BEFORE YOU DO
OR WEAR ANYTHING,

277
00:14:01,572 --> 00:14:06,277
TAKE A MINUTE, AND THINK ABOUT
HOW YOUR PARENTS ARE GOING
TO LOOK DOING AND WEARING
THE SAME THING.

278
00:14:06,343 --> 00:14:08,746
AND IF NUDITY EVER
BECOMES A TEENAGE TREND,

279
00:14:08,812 --> 00:14:11,215
WE'RE IN FOR ONE UGLY SUMMER.

280
00:14:14,885 --> 00:14:17,221
WELL, THIS WEEK ON ADVENTURES
WITH BILL, HAROLD AND BILL --

281
00:14:17,288 --> 00:14:18,422
LOOK OUT.
LOOK OUT.

282
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:20,724
LOOK OUT, HAROLD!

283
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:24,628
I GUESS BILL WAS TRYING
TO PAINT HIM!

284
00:14:24,695 --> 00:14:28,265
THEY'RE OUT IN ONE OF THOSE
PAINT BALL UNITS WE GOT
OUT NEAR THE LODGE.

285
00:14:28,332 --> 00:14:34,571
AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS
CROSSES OVER FROM A SPORT INTO
AN ARGUMENT OR EVENTUAL WAR.

286
00:14:34,638 --> 00:14:36,273
ANYWAY, THEY'RE GETTING THEIR
COVERALLS ON THERE.

287
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,508
(GUNSHOTS)

288
00:14:37,574 --> 00:14:38,842
OH. OH!

289
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:40,144
BILL, YOU'VE GOT THE GUN --

290
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,745
OH, MAN!

291
00:14:41,812 --> 00:14:42,946
THERE'S SOMETHING FOR
YOU YOUNGSTERS...

292
00:14:43,013 --> 00:14:45,683
DON'T EVER FIRE A GUN
INSIDE YOUR COVERALLS.

293
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:47,184
ALL RIGHT, THEY'RE GOING OVER
TO THE PRACTICE RANGE THERE.

294
00:14:47,251 --> 00:14:49,987
THEY HAD THE DUMMIES OF THE
MEN -- YOU KNOW, THE CUTOUTS.

295
00:14:50,054 --> 00:14:51,388
THEY'RE SHOOTING AWAY.

296
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:52,256
LOOK AT THEM GO!
LOOK AT THEM GO!

297
00:14:52,322 --> 00:14:53,824
OH, MY GOSH.

298
00:14:53,891 --> 00:14:57,027
I HOPE THERE'S NEVER ANOTHER
WAR BECAUSE WE WON'T WIN.

299
00:14:57,094 --> 00:14:58,796
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

300
00:14:58,862 --> 00:15:00,030
JUST RELAX.

301
00:15:00,097 --> 00:15:01,231
GO SEE HOW YOU DID.
GO CHECK THE TARGETS.

302
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:02,299
AWAY YOU GO.

303
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:05,269
HOW DO YOU THINK THIS WENT?

304
00:15:05,335 --> 00:15:06,937
HAROLD, YOU'VE GOT
THEM SURROUNDED.

305
00:15:07,004 --> 00:15:09,106
HOW DID YOU DO, BILL?

306
00:15:09,173 --> 00:15:11,875
WELL, IT'S A MURDER/SUICIDE.

307
00:15:11,942 --> 00:15:15,212
SO THEN THEY GO OUT THERE AND
THEY HAVE THESE WAR GAMES.

308
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,015
OH, LOOK AT THAT.
BILL HAS GOT THE TELESCOPE
LOOKING FOR HAROLD.

309
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:19,650
AND -- WHERE IS HE?

310
00:15:19,716 --> 00:15:24,054
OH, IT'S BOND.
PLYOBOND.

311
00:15:24,121 --> 00:15:29,626
OH, HOW'D THAT GO,
WOULD YOU SAY, OUT OF TEN?

312
00:15:29,693 --> 00:15:31,595
SO BILL IS WANDERING AROUND.

313
00:15:31,662 --> 00:15:33,297
STRANGE THING HAPPENS NOW.

314
00:15:33,363 --> 00:15:34,865
HE HAS A LITTLE
DISCUSSION WITH A TREE.

315
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:39,570
OH! AND BILL HAD A COMPLETE
PERSONALITY CHANGE THERE.

316
00:15:39,636 --> 00:15:42,639
AND, UNFORTUNATELY AND
SURPRISINGLY, IT WAS WORSE.

317
00:15:42,706 --> 00:15:47,444
HE GOT VERY VIOLENT AND STARTED
REALLY ARMING HIMSELF FOR A
HUGE ARMAGEDDON --

318
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:49,646
A PAINT ARMAGEDDON.

319
00:15:49,713 --> 00:15:52,983
HE GOT THE PAINT SPRAY CANS
THERE ON THE -- YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING.

320
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,785
OH, MY GOSH,
IT'S NOT RAMBO,

321
00:15:54,851 --> 00:15:56,587
IT'S HAMBO.

322
00:15:56,653 --> 00:15:57,854
AND THERE HE GOES
CHASING HAROLD.

323
00:15:57,921 --> 00:16:00,691
OH, MY GOSH, HAROLD,
RUN. RUN.

324
00:16:00,757 --> 00:16:03,227
RUN LIKE THE WIND.

325
00:16:03,293 --> 00:16:05,028
LOOK AT THE NIPPLES
ON THAT THING.

326
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:07,898
THERE GOES A LITTLE
HAND GRENADE.

327
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:09,199
WATCH OUT, HAROLD! WATCH OUT!

328
00:16:09,266 --> 00:16:12,669
OH, MY GOSH.
YOU ALL RIGHT?

329
00:16:12,736 --> 00:16:16,173
OH, BOY, THEY'RE COMING
THICK AND FAST.

330
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:19,576
OH, MY GOSH! OH, IT'S THE
BOMBING OF BRITAIN.

331
00:16:19,643 --> 00:16:23,213
OH, BOY. OH HE'S GOT
THE PAINTBRUSH DARTS.

332
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,848
LOOK OUT.
LOOK OUT.

333
00:16:24,915 --> 00:16:27,084
OH, MY GOSH, ONE INCH
OR TWO INCH?

334
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,686
HAROLD. HAROLD.
NO, NO, HAROLD, COME BACK!

335
00:16:29,753 --> 00:16:30,954
COME BACK!

336
00:16:31,021 --> 00:16:32,689
HE'S NOT A BAD LITTLE DANCER.

337
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:36,860
OH, OH! AND THEN BILL
BANGED HIS HEAD,

338
00:16:36,927 --> 00:16:40,864
AND, UNFORTUNATELY,
HE'S BACK TO NORMAL.

339
00:16:40,931 --> 00:16:45,001
YEAH, PEACE LOVING BILL AND
COMING BACK APOLOGIZING
TO HAROLD.

340
00:16:45,068 --> 00:16:46,503
EVERYTHING OKAY, HAROLD?

341
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:49,072
YEAH. NO HARM DONE, EH?
NO HARM; NO FOUL.

342
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:50,640
DON'T KNOW WHAT CAME OVER ME.

343
00:16:50,707 --> 00:16:52,409
HAROLD IS VERY,
VERY FORGIVING.

344
00:16:52,476 --> 00:16:53,977
JUST ROLLED RIGHT OFF HIM,
RIGHT, HAROLD?

345
00:16:56,012 --> 00:16:57,714
HEY! WELL, IT DOES NOW.

346
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:05,655
WELL, UNCLE RED, IT SEEMS
I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

347
00:17:05,722 --> 00:17:08,391
YEAH, YOU ALWAYS
DO, HAROLD.

348
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:09,526
WELL, YOU WERE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

349
00:17:09,593 --> 00:17:12,529
THEY'RE BUILDING
A BRAND NEW HIGHWAY.

350
00:17:13,797 --> 00:17:15,899
YEP, IT'S GONNA GO FROM
MORTONVILLE TO DINKLEBURG,

351
00:17:15,966 --> 00:17:20,137
RIGHT UP TO MOUNT WALTER AND
STRAIGHT INTO PORT ASBESTOS;

352
00:17:21,037 --> 00:17:25,142
THEREFORE, YES, IT WILL
BE CROSSING YOUR BRAND
NEW PROPERTY.

353
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,276
WHY ARE YOU
TALKING SO WEIRD?

354
00:17:26,343 --> 00:17:29,279
YOU BEEN EATIN' A LOT OF
PLUMS, HAVE YOU, HAROLD?

355
00:17:29,346 --> 00:17:31,414
NO, NO, NO, I'M JUST
SAYING THAT YOU WERE RIGHT.

356
00:17:31,481 --> 00:17:32,782
I WAS WRONG.

357
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:37,454
YOU RIGHT; ME WRONG.

358
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:39,189
WHAT'S THE HUNK OF
WIRE YOU GOT THERE?

359
00:17:39,256 --> 00:17:40,924
WIRE? OH, IT'S CABLE.

360
00:17:40,991 --> 00:17:42,158
THIS IS A STRETCH
OF THE NEW HIGHWAY.

361
00:17:42,225 --> 00:17:43,727
PARDON ME?

362
00:17:43,793 --> 00:17:47,964
OUR NEW INFORMATION HIGHWAY.

363
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,701
FIBRE OPTIC CABLE.

364
00:17:51,768 --> 00:17:54,304
YEAH, SEEMS THEY'RE GOING TO
STRING IT FROM TELEPHONE
POLE TO TELEPHONE POLE

365
00:17:54,371 --> 00:17:58,541
ALL THE WAY INTO
PORT ASBESTOS.

366
00:17:59,342 --> 00:18:02,212
SO YOU'RE SAYING THE NEW
HIGHWAY IS AN INFORMATION
HIGHWAY, HAROLD?

367
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:06,016
OH, YES, FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

368
00:18:06,082 --> 00:18:10,687
Mr. WWW.GREEDY.COM.

369
00:18:12,856 --> 00:18:15,225
WELCOME TO THE REPAIR SHOP
PART OF THE SHOW WE CALL

370
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:18,228
"IF IT AIN'T BROKE,
YOU'RE NOT TRYING."

371
00:18:18,295 --> 00:18:21,765
HAP SHAUGNESSY HAS BROUGHT
SOMETHING FROM HIS HOUSE FOR
ME TO FIX, RIGHT, HAP?

372
00:18:21,831 --> 00:18:25,535
THIS PICTURE FRAME
NEEDS REPAIRING,

373
00:18:25,602 --> 00:18:26,970
BUT IT'S NOT
FROM THE HOUSE.

374
00:18:27,037 --> 00:18:28,471
IT'S FROM THE LOUVRE.

375
00:18:28,538 --> 00:18:31,207
OH, YEAH?

376
00:18:31,274 --> 00:18:34,878
YOU GOT THIS HUNG
IN YOUR BATHROOM, DO YOU?

377
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,225
NOT THE LOO, RED,

378
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:51,227
THE LOUVRE, IN PARIS.

379
00:18:51,294 --> 00:18:53,063
OH, THE LOUVRE.

380
00:18:53,129 --> 00:18:54,631
OH, YES, IT'S LIKE AN ART
GALLERY OR MUSEUM OR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

381
00:18:54,697 --> 00:18:57,467
YEAH, YOU MIGHT
SAY THAT. YEAH!

382
00:18:57,534 --> 00:19:00,236
WELL, I DONATED THIS
IMPRESSIONIST PAINTING

383
00:19:00,303 --> 00:19:02,338
WHEN I WAS LIVING ON
THE WEST BANK THERE.

384
00:19:02,405 --> 00:19:06,276
AND THIS WEEK THEY SHIPPED
IT BACK BECAUSE THE FRAME
IS FALLING APART.

385
00:19:08,144 --> 00:19:09,412
WHAT IS THIS NOW?

386
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:11,581
IS THIS A VAN GOGH
OR A MONET?

387
00:19:12,949 --> 00:19:15,018
A HAP?

388
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:18,188
IT'S A HAP?

389
00:19:18,254 --> 00:19:20,857
ONE OF MY
BETTER ONES.
YEAH.

390
00:19:20,924 --> 00:19:23,092
YOU PAINTED THIS,
DID YOU, HAP?

391
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:25,128
IT'S FROM THE
GREEN PERIOD.

392
00:19:26,896 --> 00:19:30,300
BOY, YOU KNOW, IT SURE SEEMS
LIKE ONE OF THOSE PRINTED
POSTERS.

393
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:31,701
CAREFUL, RED.

394
00:19:31,768 --> 00:19:34,871
IT TOOK HUNDREDS OF HOURS TO GET
THE PAINT TO LIE FLAT LIKE THAT.

395
00:19:36,406 --> 00:19:38,141
NOW ABOUT THE FRAME --
WHAT ABOUT THE FRAME?

396
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,709
YEAH, YEAH, I'LL FIX THE FRAME.

397
00:19:39,776 --> 00:19:42,712
NO, NO, YOU CAN'T
USE DUCT TAPE.
OH, SURE.

398
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:44,781
THIS IS PRICELESS!

399
00:19:44,847 --> 00:19:48,184
NO, HAP,
YOU'RE PRICELESS!

400
00:19:48,251 --> 00:19:50,420
I'LL PUT THE TAPE ON THE BACK.
HOW IS THAT?

401
00:19:50,486 --> 00:19:52,722
THERE YOU GO, SHE'S FIXED.

402
00:19:55,391 --> 00:19:57,660
IN THE ART WORLD,
WE SAY RESTORED.

403
00:19:57,727 --> 00:19:58,595
RIGHT.
RIGHT.

404
00:19:58,661 --> 00:19:59,796
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

405
00:19:59,862 --> 00:20:01,531
IT'S AS GOOD AS NEW OR, AS
YOU SAY IN THE ART WORLD,

406
00:20:01,597 --> 00:20:03,900
FAKE!

407
00:20:11,407 --> 00:20:16,846
YOU KNOW SOMETHING? THIS WHOLE
HIGHWAY EXPROPRIATION PROJECT
HAS TAUGHT ME A VERY
VALUABLE LESSON.

408
00:20:16,913 --> 00:20:20,416
WHEN TRYING TO CHEAT YOUR
FRIENDS, MAKE SURE YOU DO
ALL OF YOUR HOMEWORK?

409
00:20:20,483 --> 00:20:24,620
NO, HAROLD. THE LESSON IS LIFE
REWARDS THE RISK TAKERS.

410
00:20:24,687 --> 00:20:30,493
YEAH, RIGHT. YOU'RE OUT
$400, AND YOU OWN A
PIECE OF SWAMP.

411
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,495
YOU KNOW, HAROLD,
NONE OF THAT IS TRUE.

412
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,732
DID I MISS SOMETHING?

413
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:38,334
WELL, YOU'RE MISSING SO MANY
THINGS, ACTUALLY, HAROLD.

414
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:42,171
YOU KNOW, FOR STARTERS,
THE GUY I BOUGHT THE
PROPERTY FROM,
FUZZY NORTON,

415
00:20:42,238 --> 00:20:45,475
HE PASSED AWAY
IN HIS SLEEP DURING
THE SERMON IN CHURCH.

416
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:46,576
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

417
00:20:46,642 --> 00:20:48,010
IT'S UNFORTUNATE,

418
00:20:48,077 --> 00:20:49,378
ESPECIALLY FOR HIM.

419
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:53,216
BUT IN HIS WILL,
HE LEFT THE $400
TO THE LODGE,

420
00:20:53,282 --> 00:20:57,186
AND THE LODGE DECIDED TO USE
THAT MONEY TO BUY MY PROPERTY.

421
00:20:57,253 --> 00:20:59,555
OH, REALLY?
YEAH.
YEAH.

422
00:20:59,622 --> 00:21:00,957
WHEN WAS THIS DECIDED?

423
00:21:01,023 --> 00:21:04,026
AT AN EMERGENCY MEETING
WITH AN OPEN BAR.

424
00:21:05,895 --> 00:21:09,465
I MANAGED TO CONVINCE EVERYBODY
THE VALUE OF OWNING A BOG

425
00:21:09,532 --> 00:21:14,270
WHEN SO MANY OF US HAVE
THE OLD APPLIANCES AND
THE CARS AND SO ON.

426
00:21:14,337 --> 00:21:19,041
I FIGURE THAT REAL WET SPOT WILL
SUCK DOWN A FOUR-BURNER STOVE
IN LESS THAN A MINUTE.

427
00:21:26,048 --> 00:21:27,483
IT'S A REAL WIN/WIN SITUATION.

428
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,851
I THINK SO.

429
00:21:28,918 --> 00:21:30,186
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU'RE THE PLANET EARTH.

430
00:21:30,253 --> 00:21:31,821
(POSSUM CALL)

431
00:21:31,888 --> 00:21:33,256
IT'S MEETING TIME,
UNCLE RED.

432
00:21:33,322 --> 00:21:34,857
YEAH, YOU GO
AHEAD, HAROLD.

433
00:21:34,924 --> 00:21:38,361
YOU WANT TO COME DOWN?
MAYBE YOU CAN SELL MORE
MISTAKES TO YOUR FRIENDS.

434
00:21:38,427 --> 00:21:41,430
WELL, NO, BUT YOUR PARENTS
MIGHT WANT TO GIVE IT A TRY.

435
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,272
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

436
00:21:49,338 --> 00:21:52,308
DIDN'T HAVE QUITE THE PROFIT
MARGIN WE HAD HOPED FOR ON
THE REAL ESTATE DEAL,

437
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:55,678
SO WE'LL HAVE TO PUT OFF THE
INVESTMENT INTO THOSE BLACK
VELVET PAINTINGS OF ELVIS.

438
00:21:55,745 --> 00:21:58,848
BUT HOPEFULLY THE
PRICE WON'T GO UP.

439
00:21:58,914 --> 00:22:00,616
FOR THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

440
00:22:00,683 --> 00:22:03,152
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND HAROLD
AND THE WHOLE GANG UP
HERE AT THE LODGE,

441
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:05,621
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

442
00:22:05,688 --> 00:22:11,627
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

443

[CAPTIONS PERFORMED BY
CAPTION RESOURCE CENTER]

444
00:22:19,502 --> 00:22:20,936
Harold:  SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN.

445
00:22:21,003 --> 00:22:23,739
HERE HE IS. TAKE A SEAT.

446
00:22:24,573 --> 00:22:26,609

00:22:34,884 --> 00:22:36,752
Harold:  I'VE GOT
