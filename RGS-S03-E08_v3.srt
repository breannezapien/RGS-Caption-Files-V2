41
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:37,764
SUGGESTION I GOT WAS WHY DON'T

42
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,265
YOU MAKE THE SUGGESTION BOX

43

126

127
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,323
OF THESE LITTLE UNITS

BLACK AND SILVER.

137
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,671
AND I'M THINKING TO MYSELF

138
00:03:58,671 --> 00:03:59,572
THIS COULD WORK ON ALMOST

139
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,673
ANYTHING BECAUSE THE POINT

140
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,274
IS ELECTRICITY CAN COOK MEAT

141
00:04:02,274 --> 00:04:03,576

142

LET'S MAKE IT A LITTLE BIGGER

146
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:09,949
THAN THAT WHY CAN'T WE GET

147
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:14,086
ELECTRICITY TO SAY COOK

148
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:14,987
A ROAST OR NOT QUITE SURE

149
00:04:14,987 --> 00:04:16,622
WHAT THAT IS PROBABLY A RACCOON

150
00:04:16,622 --> 00:04:17,790
I GUESS AND ALL WE'D NEED MAYBE

151
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,091
IS TO JUST GET A LITTLE MORE

152
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:20,559
POP TO THE ELECTRICITY

153
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:21,460
NOT JUST USE YOUR STANDARD

154
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,895
HOUSEHOLD CURRENT BUT MAYBE

155
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,630
HAVE A STEP UP TRANSFORMER

156
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,498
AND TAKE 'ER UP FROM

157
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:28,968
120 VOLTS UP TO WELL

158
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:31,470
HOW DOES A MILLION SOUND?

159
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,238
AND A TRANSFORMER IS REAL

160
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,506
EASY TO BUILD, IT'S BASICALLY

161
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:34,573
JUST 2 COILS OF WIRE.

162
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:35,407
SO YOU TAKE A COIL OF

00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:37,042
YOUR NORMAL 14 DASH 2 HOUSEHOLD

164

00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:41,580
OF WIRE INSIDE WHICH YOU

168
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,249
CAN GET OUT OF SAY AN OLD

169
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:44,617
ELECTRIC RAZOR, SOMETHING OF

170

THAT NATURE AND THESE ARE DARN

00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,019
EASY TO COME BY ESPECIALLY

172
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:50,089
WHILE THE GUYS ARE OUT FISHING.

173
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:50,756
SO I JUST POP THE TOP

174
00:04:50,756 --> 00:04:55,094
OFF THIS UNIT.

175
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:56,228
ALL RIGHT NOW THIS IS A GOOD

176
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:57,463
SAFETY TIP, WHENEVER YOU'RE

177
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,831
WORKING WITH A SCREWDRIVER

178
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:00,699
SEE THE WAY I DID THAT?

179
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:01,433
DON'T EVER PUT THE

180
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:02,368
SCREW DRIVER TOWARDS YOU.

181
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:03,102
I HOPE YOU WERE NOTICING THAT

182
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:03,969
ESPECIALLY YOU YOUNG KIDS

183
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:05,371
OUT THERE ALWAYS HAVE

184
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,305
THE SCREWDRIVER WORKING

185
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:07,673
AWAY FROM YOU.

186
00:05:07,673 --> 00:05:08,607
I'LL JUST POP THE TOP

187
00:05:08,607 --> 00:05:09,575
OFF THIS THING.

188
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:10,542
(GRUNTING)

189
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:13,479
(SIZZLE OF ELECTRICITY)

190
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,947
ALL RIGHT WELL I HAD

191
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:15,914
TO REPLACE THE FUSE THERE

192
00:05:15,914 --> 00:05:18,217
ACTUALLY IT WAS JUST A PENNY

193
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:19,818
AND IT HAD MELTED RIGHT OUT

194
00:05:19,818 --> 00:05:21,320
OF THERE SO I REPLACED IT

195
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,454
WITH A NICKEL, SHOULD LAST

196
00:05:22,454 --> 00:05:27,860
5 TIMES AS LONG.

197
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,627
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE

198
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:29,461
WHOLE COVERING OF THE RAZOR

199
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:31,630
MELTED RIGHT OFF SO NOW

200
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,633
I CAN JUST LOWER THAT RIGHT

201
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:37,102
INSIDE MY OUTER COIL AND WHEN

202
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:38,670
I PLUG THIS END IN WE'RE GOING

203
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,605
TO GET THE MILLION VOLTS

204
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,340
COMING RIGHT OUT HERE.

205
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,841
NOW WHAT I HAVE TO DO IS USE

206
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:44,176
SOMETHING AS AN ELECTRODE

207
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:45,277
FOR THE THING SOMETHING

208
00:05:45,277 --> 00:05:46,211
WHAT DO YOU CALL 'EM?

209
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:46,979

THE STEEL GOLF CLUB RATHER THAN

215
00:05:56,021 --> 00:06:00,058
THE WOOD KIND BECAUSE THE

216
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:01,226
WOOD DOESN'T REALLY CONDUCT

217
00:06:01,226 --> 00:06:02,494
ELECTRICITY ALL THAT WELL

218
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:03,195
ALTHOUGH IF YOU COULD GET

00:13:52,863 --> 00:13:54,064
AND THE BARN ROLLED DOWN

508
00:13:54,064 --> 00:13:55,933
THE HILL AND THAT'S

509
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:59,203
WHEN THE SHEEP HIT THE FAN

510
00:13:59,203 --> 00:14:01,672
'CAUSE LIGHTNING HIT THE SILO

AND THE ENTIRE TOWN

512
00:14:02,806 --> 00:14:07,478
WAS COVERED WITH POPCORN

513
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:09,146

528

00:14:31,969 --> 00:14:32,703

531
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,470

00:14:36,707 --> 00:14:40,010
ANYWAY BILL OH, OH, OH WELL

535
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,179

538
00:14:44,715 --> 00:14:45,749
OF MAKE IT SOMETHING A LITTLE

539
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:49,286
SOFTER THAN, WHAT IS THAT?

540
00:14:49,286 --> 00:14:50,287
APPARENTLY BILL KEEPS HIS

541
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:52,723
GROUND SHEET IN HIS COVERALLS

542
00:14:52,723 --> 00:14:59,329
WELL I DON'T EVEN WANT TO THINK

543
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:00,931
ABOUT THIS BUT WE HAD TO GET

544
00:15:00,931 --> 00:15:02,933
IT UNROLLED WE GET THAT

545
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:06,437
SPREAD OUT, BOY OH BOY

546
00:15:06,437 --> 00:15:07,504
ANYWAY YOU GET THAT SPREAD OUT

547
00:15:07,504 --> 00:15:08,806
OVER THE BITS OF BRUSH AND

548
00:15:08,806 --> 00:15:10,174
EVERYTHING KEEP THE LEAVES

549
00:15:10,174 --> 00:15:11,508
AWAY FROM YOU.

550
00:15:11,508 --> 00:15:12,876
THE NEXT UNIT YOU NEED THERE

551
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:15,012
WAS THE SLEEPING BAG

552
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:18,949
THE COVER YOU JUST THROW OH!

553
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:20,050
OH BOY!

554
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,752
OH WELL SO BILL'S GOING

555
00:15:21,752 --> 00:15:23,120
TO UNROLL HIS SLEEPING BAG

556
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,054
BUT THIS THING HAD BEEN

557
00:15:24,054 --> 00:15:25,022
ROLLED UP SO LONG SHE HAD

558
00:15:25,022 --> 00:15:29,159
A LOT OF TENSION BUILT UP

559
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,227
THAT'S VERY STRANGE ISN'T IT?

560
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:31,495
WELL IT TURNS OUT IT WASN'T

561
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:32,629
JUST THE TENSION THERE WAS

562
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:35,165
SOMETHING IT WAS YEAH,

563
00:15:35,165 --> 00:15:36,433
IT WAS A ROCK YEAH THERE WAS

564
00:15:36,433 --> 00:15:38,135
A ROCK INSIDE THE BAG

565
00:15:38,135 --> 00:15:39,436
WE DON'T NEED THAT NEAR OUR BED

566
00:15:39,436 --> 00:15:41,171
SO BILL UNFORTUNATELY RIGHT

567

OH, OH, OH, OH AND AGAIN WELL

569
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:49,079
BILL ALWAYS CLAIMS A SLEEPING

570
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:50,480
BAG IS KIND OF COLD WHEN

571
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,848
YOU FIRST GET INTO IT BUT

572
00:15:51,848 --> 00:15:52,849

WHO PUT THAT THERE?

592
00:16:35,826 --> 00:16:36,593

00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:45,569
CAN'T PLAY AN INSTRUMENT

NAME'S ARE IMPORTANT SO

611
00:17:01,952 --> 00:17:06,857
SOMETHING LIKE 'THE PHLEB'

612
00:17:06,857 --> 00:17:11,194
OR 'YESTERDAY'S IMPLOSION'

613
00:17:11,194 --> 00:17:11,928

THEY'RE HIRING MUSICIANS RIGHT

625
00:17:29,713 --> 00:17:32,916
AND THEN YOU GRAB THE REJECTS

626
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,384

627

A GUARANTEED WEEKLY SALARY

632
00:17:43,693 --> 00:17:46,162
YES OF COURSE THIS IS ALL A RISK

633
00:17:46,162 --> 00:17:48,365
BUT YOU HAVE TO PAY YOUR DUES

634
00:17:48,365 --> 00:17:49,633
OR SHOULD I SAY I HAVE

635
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:54,037
TO PAY THEIR DUES.

636
00:17:54,037 --> 00:17:56,006
STRUMS GUITAR

637
00:17:56,006 --> 00:18:01,778
HOW DO THEY DO THAT?

638
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:07,384
>>RED: I WANT TO GIVE SOME

639
00:18:07,384 --> 00:18:08,418
ADVICE TO YOU TEENAGERS

640
00:18:08,418 --> 00:18:09,419
IF I MIGHT

641
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:10,287
BECAUSE THE ADULTS THEY DON'T

642
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:11,488
LISTEN ANYWAY AND THEY'RE

643
00:18:11,488 --> 00:18:13,156
TOO OLD TO CHANGE AND EVEN IF

644
00:18:13,156 --> 00:18:14,124
THEY COULD THEY'RE GOING TO BE

645
00:18:14,124 --> 00:18:16,326
DEAD SOON SO WHAT'S THE POINT?

646
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:17,360
AND HOW THIS HAPPENED HAROLD

647
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,928
WANTED TO GO TO A MOVIE IN TOWN

648
00:18:18,928 --> 00:18:19,863
AND HE COULDN'T DECIDE WHETHER

649
00:18:19,863 --> 00:18:21,631
TO SEE 'BUZZ SAW BUTCHERY

650
00:18:21,631 --> 00:18:22,866
ON MAIN STREET PART 9

651
00:18:22,866 --> 00:18:24,834
THE EVISCERATION' OR A

652
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:26,102
NEW COMEDY THEY GOT CALLED

653
00:18:26,102 --> 00:18:29,072
'TRASH MY PARENT'S HOUSE'.

654
00:18:29,072 --> 00:18:29,939
SO INSTEAD I DECIDED

655
00:18:29,939 --> 00:18:30,807
WE'D RENT A CLASSIC FILM

656
00:18:30,807 --> 00:18:31,975
WATCH IT AT THE LODGE

657
00:18:31,975 --> 00:18:34,711
IT WAS 'ACROSS THE PACIFIC'

658
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:35,679

660
00:18:37,847 --> 00:18:39,616
WHO DRANK A LOT.

661
00:18:39,616 --> 00:18:40,784
WHEN IT WAS OVER HAROLD SAID

662
00:18:40,784 --> 00:18:41,951
HE THOUGHT IT WAS RACIST,

663
00:18:41,951 --> 00:18:44,287
SEXIST, OVER ACTED,

664
00:18:44,287 --> 00:18:46,056
WITH SOME REAL CORNY

665
00:18:46,056 --> 00:18:47,390
MELODRAMATIC DIALOGUE AND

666
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,892
SOME CHEESY SPECIAL EFFECTS.

667
00:18:48,892 --> 00:18:49,759
WHEREAS I THOUGHT IT WAS

668
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:51,561
JUST BORING...

669
00:18:51,561 --> 00:18:52,462
SO THE NEXT TIME YOUR PARENTS

670
00:18:52,462 --> 00:18:53,363
SAY TO YOU THEY DON'T MAKE

671
00:18:53,363 --> 00:18:55,131
MOVIES LIKE THEY USED TO

672
00:18:55,131 --> 00:18:58,134
DON'T BE UPSET ABOUT THAT.

673
00:18:59,002 --> 00:18:59,969
>>RED: I THOUGHT IT WOULD

674
00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:00,737

678
00:19:04,207 --> 00:19:05,208

679
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:09,245
OF DISPOSABLE INCOME.

680
00:19:09,245 --> 00:19:10,480

>>RED: YEAH I CAN DO THAT,

00:19:21,457 --> 00:19:22,225

00:19:27,931 --> 00:19:29,098
AROUND IN A WHILE

695
00:19:29,098 --> 00:19:30,633
DON'T KNOW WHY.

696
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:31,534
>>RED: I'LL TAKE CARE

697
00:19:31,534 --> 00:19:32,502

698
00:19:32,502 --> 00:19:33,469
>>GORD: THANKS.

699
00:19:33,469 --> 00:19:34,237
HEY SOMETHING REALLY

700
00:19:34,237 --> 00:19:35,939
DIFFERENT ABOUT YOU TODAY.

701
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:37,640
>>RED: YEAH IT'S MY SHIRT.

702
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,641
>>GORD: NO, NO, SOMETHING ELSE

703
00:19:38,641 --> 00:19:39,542
YOU'VE GAINED A LOT OF WEIGHT

704
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:40,577
AND GOTTEN ALL GREY

705
00:19:40,577 --> 00:19:42,912
OR SOMETHING.

706
00:19:42,912 --> 00:19:43,713
>>RED: NO IT'S JUST MY SHIRT

707
00:19:43,713 --> 00:19:44,480
THAT'S THE ONLY THING

708
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,182
THAT'S CHANGED ABOUT ME.

709
00:19:46,182 --> 00:19:47,317
YOU SEEM PRETTY WELL

710
00:19:47,317 --> 00:19:49,218

>>GORD: YEAH YEAH WELL

712
00:19:50,353 --> 00:19:51,120
THAT'S WHAT THIS JOB DEMANDS

713
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,889
BEING THE SAME MAN EVERYDAY

714
00:19:52,889 --> 00:19:54,524
LOOKING OUT OVER THE SAME FOREST

715
00:19:54,524 --> 00:19:59,429
SAMENESS SAME, SAME, SAME

716
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:01,364
YEAH STARING AT THE SAME SUN,

717
00:20:01,364 --> 00:20:02,899
LOOKING AT THE SAME CLOUDS,

718
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:04,600
TALKING TO THEM.

719
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,668
THEY CHANGE, THEY CHANGE

720
00:20:05,668 --> 00:20:07,503
THAT'S TRUE, THANK GOODNESS

721
00:20:07,503 --> 00:20:08,638
FOR THE CLOUDS A GUY COULD

722
00:20:08,638 --> 00:20:10,807
GET LONELY BUT I KNOW H.Q. IS

723
00:20:10,807 --> 00:20:12,108
COUNTING ON ME SO I'M NOT GOING

724
00:20:12,108 --> 00:20:13,876
TO LET THEM DOWN OH DID YOU

725
00:20:13,876 --> 00:20:15,244
CHECK MY MAILBOX ON THE WAY UP?

726
00:20:15,244 --> 00:20:16,846
>>RED: YEAH, THERE'S NOTHING

727
00:20:16,846 --> 00:20:21,984
THERE, NO.

728
00:20:21,984 --> 00:20:22,652
>>GORD: THAT'S OKAY.

729
00:20:22,652 --> 00:20:23,586
YOU KNOW THEY USED TO SEND

730
00:20:23,586 --> 00:20:24,587
A PAYCHEQUE EVERY COUPLE

731
00:20:24,587 --> 00:20:25,888
OF MONTHS BUT I KNOW HOW

732
00:20:25,888 --> 00:20:30,326
HECTIC OFFICE WORK CAN GET.

733
00:20:30,326 --> 00:20:31,894
NO PROBLEM IT'S NOT LIKE I

734
00:20:31,894 --> 00:20:33,596
CAN SPEND IT ON ANYTHING ANYWAY.

735
00:20:33,596 --> 00:20:35,865
>>RED: WELL NOW ACTUALLY IT'S

736
00:20:35,865 --> 00:20:36,899
INTERESTING THAT YOU SHOULD SAY

737
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:38,034
THAT BECAUSE I WAS JUST HERE

738
00:20:38,034 --> 00:20:38,801
TO INVITE YOU TO COME DOWN

739
00:20:38,801 --> 00:20:39,569
TO THE LODGE TONIGHT FOR

740
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:43,539
CASINO NIGHT.

741
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:44,574
>>GORD: NO, NO.

742
00:20:44,574 --> 00:20:45,274
>>RED: OH SURE COME ON.

743
00:20:45,274 --> 00:20:46,242
>>GORD: NO, NO, I COULDN'T

744
00:20:46,242 --> 00:20:47,043
I MEAN WHO'S GOING TO LOOK

745
00:20:47,043 --> 00:20:48,811
AFTER THE FOREST HUH?

746
00:20:48,811 --> 00:20:50,413
I MEAN PEOPLE ARE COUNTING ON ME

747
00:20:50,413 --> 00:20:51,581
TO PROTECT THEM AND NOT JUST

748
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:52,348
WHEN IT'S CONVENIENT OR WHEN

749
00:20:52,348 --> 00:20:53,683
IT CO ORDINATES WITH MY

750
00:20:53,683 --> 00:20:58,821
SOCIAL CALENDAR.

751
00:20:58,821 --> 00:21:00,590
NO THANK YOU, PLUS THE FACT

752
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,492
THAT H.Q. HAS NEVER SENT

753
00:21:02,492 --> 00:21:03,960
AN INSPECTOR TO VISIT ME IN

754
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,794
THE 16 YEARS I'VE BEEN

755
00:21:04,794 --> 00:21:06,929
A FOREST RANGER

756
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:09,899
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?

757
00:21:09,899 --> 00:21:10,733
>>RED: THAT THEY

758
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:16,138
FORGOT ABOUT YOU?

759
00:21:16,138 --> 00:21:16,772
>>GORD: NO THAT

760
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:17,740
I'M DUE, OVERDUE.

761
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,474
>>RED: OH ALL RIGHT.

762
00:21:18,474 --> 00:21:19,175
>>GORD: TONIGHT

763
00:21:19,175 --> 00:21:20,042
COULD BE THE NIGHT.

764
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:20,810
>>RED: ALL RIGHT.

765
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:21,644
>>GORD: TONIGHT.

766
00:21:21,644 --> 00:21:22,445
>>RED: ALL RIGHT.

767
00:21:22,445 --> 00:21:23,179
>>GORD: YEAH BUT THANKS ANYWAY

768
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:24,013
COME BY AND VISIT AFTER

769
00:21:24,013 --> 00:21:24,780
I'M UP ALL NIGHT.

770
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,681
>>RED: WELL I CAN ONLY MAKE

771
00:21:25,681 --> 00:21:26,883
SUGGESTIONS TO THE FELLAS

772
00:21:26,883 --> 00:21:28,651
I DON'T KNOW THEY GO...

773
00:21:28,651 --> 00:21:29,752
>>GORD: GREAT BE FUN THEN

774
00:21:29,752 --> 00:21:31,554
SEE YOU LATER, I CAN MAKE

775
00:21:31,554 --> 00:21:33,990
LITTLE SNACKS ON TOAST.

776
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,991
>>RED: OH DON'T MAKE ANYTHING

777
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:35,725
UNTIL WE GET HERE GORD.

778
00:21:35,725 --> 00:21:36,559
>>GORD: OH NO PROBLEM

779
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,326
WHAT TIME EXACTLY?

780
00:21:37,326 --> 00:21:38,427
>>RED: NOT BEFORE MIDNIGHT

781
00:21:38,427 --> 00:21:39,962
I WOULDN'T THINK.

782
00:21:39,962 --> 00:21:40,663
>>GORD: NO PROBLEM, NO PROBLEM

783
00:21:40,663 --> 00:21:43,699
UP ALL NIGHT, ALL NIGHT.

784
00:21:46,502 --> 00:21:48,137
>>RED: WELL THE CASINO NIGHT...

785
00:21:48,137 --> 00:21:53,976
(HAROLD CHUCKLING)

786
00:21:53,976 --> 00:21:55,044
>>RED: YOU'RE A BORN

787
00:21:55,044 --> 00:21:56,979
LEADER HAROLD.

788
00:21:56,979 --> 00:21:58,514
CASINO NIGHT IS A DEFINITE GO

789
00:21:58,514 --> 00:21:59,348
ALTHOUGH WE ALMOST HAD TO

790
00:21:59,348 --> 00:22:00,516
CANCEL AT THE LAST MINUTE

791
00:22:00,516 --> 00:22:01,550
BECAUSE STINKY PETERSON

792
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,618
MISUNDERSTOOD THE TERM

793
00:22:02,618 --> 00:22:07,056
CRAPS TABLE.

794
00:22:07,056 --> 00:22:07,857
DO YOU HAVE TO CHANGE WHERE

795
00:22:07,857 --> 00:22:09,659
I CAN SEE YOU HAROLD?

796
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:14,230
I'LL NEVER EAT CHICKEN AGAIN.

797
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:14,964
ANYWAY THE WEATHER'S REAL GOOD

798
00:22:14,964 --> 00:22:15,698
SO WE DECIDED TO MOVE THE

799
00:22:15,698 --> 00:22:17,033
CASINO NIGHT OUTDOORS

800
00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:18,401
WE GOT A ROULETTE WHEEL,

801
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:19,201
A ONE-ARMED BANDIT

802
00:22:19,201 --> 00:22:21,804
AND A ONE-LEGGED BARTENDER

803
00:22:21,804 --> 00:22:23,039
THREW ALL THE BEER INTO THE LAKE

804
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,208
OR AS WE CALL IT OUR WET BAR

805
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:27,410
ALL WE NEED NOW IS ORGANIZED

806
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,244
CRIME IT'D BE JUST

807
00:22:28,244 --> 00:22:34,316
LIKE LAS VEGAS.

808
00:22:34,316 --> 00:22:35,851
(POSSUM SQUEALING)

809
00:22:35,851 --> 00:22:37,019
>>HAROLD: OH IT'S

810
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:38,421
THE SOUND OF THE POSSUM

811
00:22:38,421 --> 00:22:39,121
WE GOT TO LEAVE NOW.

812
00:22:39,121 --> 00:22:39,755
>>RED: YEAH WELL YOU GO AHEAD

813
00:22:39,755 --> 00:22:41,123
HAROLD I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

814
00:22:41,123 --> 00:22:42,158
>>HAROLD: I LOOK LIKE YOU NOW.

815
00:22:42,158 --> 00:22:42,792
>>RED: YEAH YEAH YOU

816
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:45,294
LOOK TERRIFIC.

817
00:22:45,294 --> 00:22:48,564
IT'S A SHAME ISN'T IT?

818
00:22:48,564 --> 00:22:49,331
ANYWAY WE'LL GET THE MEETING

819
00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:50,599
WRAPPED UP IN A HURRY SO WE

820
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:51,967
CAN GET OUT THERE AND START

821
00:22:51,967 --> 00:22:53,269
LOSING MONEY WHICH I SUPPOSE

822
00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:55,604
IS THE FUN OF GAMBLING

823
00:22:55,604 --> 00:22:56,672
THE ART OF THE DEAL

824
00:22:56,672 --> 00:22:57,573
AS DONALD TRUMP WOULD SAY

825
00:22:57,573 --> 00:22:58,674
ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK THERE

826
00:22:58,674 --> 00:22:59,875
IS ANY TRUMP IN POKER

827
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:00,643
AND YET HE OWNS A COUPLE

828
00:23:00,643 --> 00:23:04,046
OF CASINOS SO GO FIGURE.

829
00:23:04,046 --> 00:23:04,914
ANYWAY IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING

830
00:23:04,914 --> 00:23:06,081
THAT BLEACH YOU GAVE ME

831
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:07,082
TOOK THE RELISH STAINS

832
00:23:07,082 --> 00:23:07,883
RIGHT OUT OF THE SHIRT AND

833
00:23:07,883 --> 00:23:09,185
DIDN'T HARM THE FLANNEL AT ALL

834
00:23:09,185 --> 00:23:11,387
SO EVERYBODY ELSE ON BEHALF OF

835
00:23:11,387 --> 00:23:12,321
MYSELF AND HAROLD AND THE WHOLE

836
