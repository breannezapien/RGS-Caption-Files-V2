00:07:44,663 --> 00:07:46,698
YOU CAN EVEN SET
THE LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY

157
00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:49,134
BY ADJUSTING THE
TENSION ON THE REEL.

158
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:51,436
AND OF COURSE THE OBSTACLES
YOU ARE TRYING TO AVOID

159
00:07:51,436 --> 00:07:53,872
ARE THE DREADED
BUBBLES OF DEATH.

160
00:07:53,872 --> 00:07:55,774
SEE, I'VE GOT THIS
JAR OF LIQUID SOAP

161
00:07:55,774 --> 00:07:59,177
CONNECTED TO A SIPHON TUBE
TO THIS BUBBLE BLOWER.

162
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:01,046
SO AS YOU DRIVE ALONG,

163
00:08:01,046 --> 00:08:03,048
THE WIND FIRES THE BUBBLES
TOWARDS THE ACTION HERO

164
00:08:03,048 --> 00:08:07,652
AND THE KID USES THE
FISHING ROD TO DODGE THE SOAP.

165
00:08:09,821 --> 00:08:11,423
PUT A LITTLE
DIRT ON THE GUY.

166
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:14,226
AS SOON AS HE'S CLEAN,
GAME'S OVER.

167
00:08:17,128 --> 00:08:19,130
OKAY, NOW, TO KEEP
THE OTHER KID AMUSED,

168
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,299
I CUT A HOLE IN THE ROOF
AND HUNG AN AQUARIUM

169
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:22,968
FILLED WITH GOLDFISH.

170
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:25,604
THIS IS TO
SIMULATE A MOVIE.

171
00:08:25,604 --> 00:08:28,406
YOU JUST SHOW 'EM THE BOX FROM
"20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA,"

172
00:08:28,406 --> 00:08:30,508
AND HE'LL BE CONVINCED.

173
00:08:30,508 --> 00:08:32,577
BY THE WAY, IF ONE
OF YOUR KIDS IS SMART,

174
00:08:32,577 --> 00:08:36,381
YOU SHOULD DO THIS
WITH THE OTHER ONE.

175
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:38,883
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

176
00:08:38,883 --> 00:08:40,819
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

177
00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:43,688
AND FOR THAT LITTLE EXTRA
SOMETHING THAT EVERY
PARENT LOVES,

178
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:45,724
GET YOURSELF ONE
OF THESE TOY MICROPHONES

OUT THE RADIO.

180
00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:51,796
Hello, am I coming through?
Is this working?

181
00:08:51,796 --> 00:08:55,033
THEY SELL THESE SO KIDS CAN
PRETEND THEY'RE FAMOUS SINGERS.

in a girdle cage

184
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:05,543
THIS MICROPHONE IS NOT
FOR THE KIDS TO SING INTO.

185
00:09:05,543 --> 00:09:07,379
IT'S FOR YOU TO TALK INTO.

186
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:09,614
Hey, you two,
settle down back there.

187
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:15,453
I saw that!

188
00:09:15,453 --> 00:09:17,689
Don't make me
come back there.

189
00:09:25,997 --> 00:09:28,066
I WANNA TALK TO YOU
OLDER GUYS A LITTLE BIT

190
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:30,502
ABOUT THE GENERATION GAP.

191
00:09:30,502 --> 00:09:32,537
REMEMBER WHEN
IT WAS A GOOD THING?

192
00:09:32,537 --> 00:09:36,775
BACK IN THE '60s WHEN WE WERE
COMIN' UP TO SPEED

193
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:39,344
ON THE ONRAMP OF
THE HIGHWAY OF LIFE.

PUT A FEW MILES ON US
SINCE THEN, HAVEN'T WE?

195
00:09:43,014 --> 00:09:46,017
NOW WE'RE STOPPING
AT EVERY SERVICE CENTRE.

196
00:09:46,017 --> 00:09:50,789
KIND OF WORRIED THAT MAYBE
THE NEXT EXIT WILL BE OURS.

197
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:52,824
WE WENT FROM CHANTING,
"MAKE LOVE NOT WAR,"

198
00:09:52,824 --> 00:09:56,060
TO GETTING MARRIED
AND DOIN' BOTH.

199
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,263
AND NOW SOME OF US
EVEN HAVE KIDS --

200
00:09:58,263 --> 00:09:59,998
OR AS THEY'RE ALSO KNOWN,

201
00:09:59,998 --> 00:10:02,033
THE ULTIMATE PAYBACK.

202
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:04,469
SEE, NOBODY TALKS ABOUT THE
GENERATION GAP ANYMORE.

203
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:07,472
THAT'S BECAUSE MOST OF US
ARE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF IT.

204
00:10:07,472 --> 00:10:08,873
BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

205
00:10:08,873 --> 00:10:11,409
IT'S OKAY TO BE ON THE WRONG
SIDE OF THE GENERATION GAP

206
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:12,977
OR THE WRONG SIDE
OF YOUR BOSS

OR EVEN ONCE IN A WHILE,
THE WRONG SIDE OF YOUR WIFE.

YOU GO TO THE CEMETERY

WE DON'T MIND

WE USED TO HAVE A LOT
OF FLIES EVERYWHERE
IN THE LODGE,

BUT NOW WE GOT SPIDERS,

OH, GREAT.

AND WE FOUND OUT
WHERE THE WOMEN WERE.

227
00:11:06,397 --> 00:11:07,732
OH, AT THE CHURCH.
AT THE CHURCH.

THEY'RE AT THE WOMEN'S --

HOW'D YOU
KNOW ABOUT THAT?

230
00:11:11,302 --> 00:11:13,438
WELL, THEY MEET
EVERY MONDAY AFTERNOON.

HOW LONG'S THAT
BEEN GOIN' ON?

YOU DIDN'T ASK.

235
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,849

THEY ALL GET TOGETHER AND

YOU KNOW, THAT COULD
BE VALUABLE INFORMATION.

GET AWAY FROM THE BUILDING.

GONE AT THAT POINT.

HE COULD CLIMB UP
THE SIDE THERE --

306

HOOKED HIS
FISHING LINE ON THERE,

307
00:14:19,256 --> 00:14:21,425
JUST KIND OF
WIND HIMSELF UP,

308
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:23,127
RIGHT UP THE UNIT THERE.

309
00:14:23,127 --> 00:14:25,162
MEANWHILE, I HAD FOUND
MY WAY BACK TO THE VAN,

310
00:14:25,162 --> 00:14:27,798
BUT I DIDN'T NOTICE,
OF COURSE, THAT WALTER
WAS UP THERE.

311

STILL NOT REALLY
GETTING MUCH OF A SIGNAL,

312
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,338
AND SO I THOUGHT IF I COULD
TAKE HER UP TO THE POINT --

313
00:14:34,338 --> 00:14:38,842
THIS WAS REALLY NOT
THE BEST THING TO DO.

AT HOME, KIDS.

315

THEN I HEAR WALTER
UP ON THE ROOF,

316
00:14:42,513 --> 00:14:45,616
SO I HIT THE BRAKES.

317
00:14:45,616 --> 00:14:49,887
AND I COME OUT TO
SEE WHAT EXACTLY IT WAS

318
00:14:49,887 --> 00:14:51,655
THAT HE WAS CALLING ABOUT,

319
00:14:51,655 --> 00:14:53,590
AND HE WANTED TO SEE
IF I WANTED TO GO FISHING.

LITTLE LATE NOW.

CALLED ME EARLIER.

MY MOTHER WOULD ALWAYS
COOK UP A TURKEY

WITH POTATOES ALL AROUND
THE OUTSIDE.

326

I MEAN, IT'S AN
EASY WAY TO COOK,

327
00:15:18,982 --> 00:15:20,651
BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY
WORK UP HERE AT THE LODGE

328
00:15:20,651 --> 00:15:22,586
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT
SO MANY BIG EATERS.

329
00:15:22,586 --> 00:15:25,823

A 25-POUND TURKEY ON A
ROOFING NAIL

330
00:15:25,823 --> 00:15:28,058
AND CALL IT
AN HORS D'OEUVRE.

331
00:15:28,058 --> 00:15:30,127
SO WE HAD TO TAKE
OUR COOKING TECHNIQUES

AND BIGGIE SIZE 'EM.

333
00:15:31,762 --> 00:15:33,831
THE REAL PROBLEM HERE
IS THAT THE AVERAGE OVEN

334
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:36,500
ONLY HOLDS ABOUT
NINE CUBIC FEET OF FOOD,

335
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,403
WHICH IS THE SAME CAPACITY
AS MOOSE'S LEFT CHEEK --

336
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:41,004
THE ONE HE EATS WITH.

337
00:15:41,004 --> 00:15:42,940
SO WE NEED A
BIGGER COOKER.

341
00:15:51,148 --> 00:15:53,016
SO IT'S JUST LIKE
A GIFT FROM HEAVEN.

342
00:15:53,016 --> 00:15:55,619
ALL'S I HAVE TO DO IS TAKE
