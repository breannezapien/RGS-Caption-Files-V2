1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:04,337
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

2
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,873
HERE'S THE MAN WHO WAS VOTED

3
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:08,341
HEAD OF POSSUM LODGE, 'CAUSE

4
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:09,843
THE OTHER BODY PARTS
WERE SPOKEN FOR,

5
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,612
YOUR HERO, MY UNCLE, RED GREEN!

6
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:17,183
(Applause and cheering)

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,854
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

8
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,089
GOT SOME BAD NEWS,
UNFORTUNATELY.

9
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:24,457
A BIT OF A DISASTER

10
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,192
THIS WEEK AT THE LODGE.

11
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:27,327
BUSTER HADFIELD'S HOUSE

12
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,796
WAS BURNED DOWN BY HIS BUDGIE.

13
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:31,631
OH NO.

14
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:32,632
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

15
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,968
PLAYING WITH MATCHES.

16
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:39,105
BUSTER LETS THE LITTLE GUY
FLY AROUND.

17
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:40,807
HE EATS BITS OF POTATO CHIPS

18
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:42,108
FROM BETWEEN
THE COUCH CUSHIONS.

19
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,478
HE GOT POKING AROUND
WHERE HE SHOULDN'T HAVE,

20
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:48,148
AND HE PLUGGED HIMSELF INTO
AN ELECTRICAL OUTLET.

21
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,117
OH, THAT'S AWFUL.

22
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:54,788
HE WENT UP JUST LIKE A FLARE,
HAROLD.

23
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:58,458
DIDN'T EVEN BLOW A FUSE
ON THAT ONE.

24
00:00:58,458 --> 00:00:59,626
THE HOUSE BURNED TO THE GROUND.

25
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:02,062
THAT'S HARDLY AN ACCIDENT.

26
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,065
YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE
SMOKE DETECTORS, ALARMS.

27
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,334
YOUR FIRE EXTINGUISHERS
ARE NEVER CHARGED UP.

28
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:09,936
IT'S A WONDER
THERE'S NOT MORE FIRES.

29
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,405
DIDN'T EVEN BLOW A FUSE.

30
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,340
THAT WAS A DEAD SHORT.

31
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,910
WRECKLESS, IRRESPONSIBLE
NEGLIGENCE, UNCLE RED.

32
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,311
BUSTER HAS NO HOME.

33
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:21,214
WHAT DID WE LEARN FROM
OUR MOST RECENT DISASTER?

34
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:25,151
WE LEARNED THAT EVEN
AN ADULT, FULLY-GROWN BUDGIE

35
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,319
DRAWS LESS THAN 15 AMPS.

36
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,754
(Laughing)

37
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:32,692
(Horns honking)

38
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:37,163
(Geese honking)

39
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,667
(Quacking)

40
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,972
(Red): YOU'RE LOOKIN'
AT SEGMENTS

41
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,740
FROM THIS PARTICULAR SHOW,

42
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:49,242
THE MESSAGE BEING,

43
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,744
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT
CHANGING THE CHANNEL.

44
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:54,247
TO MAKE SENSE
OUT OF THIS PROGRAMME,

45
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:55,782
YOU GOTTA GIVE IT

46
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,383
YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.

47
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:09,362
AROUND HERE, PEOPLE GET DOWN,
BUT THEY DON'T STAY DOWN.

48
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,465
WE'RE GONNA TURN BUSTER'S FIRE
INTO AN OPPORTUNITY.

49
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:15,401
YOU GOING INTO
THE CHARCOAL BUSINESS?

50
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:19,139
NO, HAROLD -- WE'RE GONNA DO
WHAT THE PIONEERS DID.

51
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:22,075
YOU'RE MOVING TO CALIFORNIA?! --
OH! OH! OH!

52
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,011
MAYBE I CAN MEET SPIELBERG.

53
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:27,046
I GOT THIS IDEA, THIS TREATMENT.

54
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:28,815
THE TREATMENT'S NOT WORKING.

55
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,518
(Laughing)

56
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,453
THINK BACK TO THE PIONEERS,
OK.

57
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:33,987
WHAT DID THEY DO

58
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,622
WHEN THE GUY NEXT DOOR'S HOUSE
BURNED DOWN?

59
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,956
MOVE AWAY?

60
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,726
KEEP THEIR OWN HOUSES WET.

61
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,195
HAROLD, THEY'D ALL PITCH IN
AND BUILD THE GUY A NEW HOUSE.

62
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:45,765
OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, OK,
LIKE A BARN RAISING.

63
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,867
EXCEPT THIS IS BUSTER'S HOUSE.

64
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:51,037
NO, YOU KNOW, I THINK
BARN RAISING IS A GOOD ANALOGY.

65
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:55,341
YOU KNOW WHO DOES THAT IS
THE AMISH AND THE MENNONITES.

66
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,977
INSTEAD OF A BUNCH OF
DEVOUT CRAFTSMEN,

67
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:00,313
IT'S GOING TO BE A GANG
OF DRUNKS.

68
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,049
WELL, I FIGURE IT WILL GO
A LOT FASTER.

69
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,988
LATER ON IN
"ADVENTURES WITH BILL",

70
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:10,924
WE'LL BE DOING
SOME HIGH-WIRE WALKING.

71
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:14,594
BUT I HAD HEARD --
ONE OF THE FELLAS TOLD ME

72
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,462
THAT BILL WAS STUCK UP
AT THE TOP OF A FLAGPOLE,

73
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,565
AND THEY ASKED ME
TO GO AND GET HIM.

74
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,200
BUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS

75
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,636
HE WAS TRYING TO GET
THE FLAG DOWN.

76
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,673
COMMUNICATION IS --
THAT'S WHEN -- AND THE --

77
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:30,677
ANYWAY, BILL HAD APPARENTLY
SHINNIED --

78
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,946
YOU DON'T VERY OFTEN SEE
AN ADULT SHINNY.

79
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:33,880
YOU'RE STILL NOT.

80
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:35,882
BUT, OF COURSE,

81
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,951
I DIDN'T GET THERE TILL
HE WAS UP AT THE TOP.

82
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,954
HE WAS STUCK UP THERE.

83
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,789
I'LL GET YOU DOWN.

84
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,657
IT'S ALL RIGHT, JUST RELAX.

85
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,725
I THINK IF I GET

86
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,127
THE POLE VIBRATING,
HE'S GOT TO SLIDE DOWN.

87
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,763
RELAX --
YOU'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.

88
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,299
OH, YOU'RE FINE, YOU'RE FINE.

89
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,368
BOY, OH, BOY.

90
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,337
SOMETIMES THE FEAR
IS SO STRONG IN THEM,

91
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:58,938
THEIR FINGERS TIGHTEN UP,

92
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,140
THEIR FINGERNAILS
DIG INTO THE POLE.

93
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,543
LUCKILY, I HAD A LITTLE
CHAIN-SAW UNIT THERE.

94
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,013
WHERE THERE'S A WILL
THERE'S A WAY.

95
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,448
(Laughing)

96
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,516
SORRY, BILL.

97
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,018
DON'T THANK ME.

98
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,753
THAT'S FINE, THAT'S FINE.

99
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,892
OH, SOMETIMES
I GET TO THINKIN'

100
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,028
'BOUT ALL THE MISTAKES
I'VE MADE

101
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,063
ALL THE PEOPLE
I'VE HURT

102
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,032
AND ALL THE BILLS
I HAVEN'T PAID

103
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,967
SOMETIMES
I GET TO THINKIN'

104
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,270
I SHOULD CHANGE
AND GET ON THE BALL

105
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,405
BUT THEN I TURN ON
THE OLD T.V.

106
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,807
AND I DON'T GET TO THINKIN'
AT ALL

107
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,880
OK, FOR
A FREE CHIROPRACTIC ADJUSTMENT

108
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,682
AT ARNIE'S AUTOBODY SHOP,

109
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:46,619
UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO GET MR. HUMPHREY

110
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,754
TO SAY THIS WORD,

111
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,255
"WOLVES".

112
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:52,492
OOOOH, GO!

113
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:56,162
OK, DALTON, THESE ARE
LIKE DOGS, ONLY BIGGER.

114
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:59,198
MY WIFE'S SIDE OF THE FAMILY.

115
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:00,700
NO.

116
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,069
THESE ARE ANIMALS, DALTON.

117
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,038
THEY TRAVEL IN PACKS.

118
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,106
YEAH, THAT'S MY WIFE'S SIDE
OF THE FAMILY.

119
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:08,608
COME ON, COME ON.

120
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,010
THESE ARE LIKE A FOX,
ONLY BIGGER.

121
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,512
BIGGER TEETH.

122
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,380
MY WIFE'S SIDE OF THE FAMILY.

123
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,649
WHY DO YOU KEEP SAYING THAT?

124
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,551
JUST FEELS GOOD, THAT'S ALL!

125
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,086
NO, NO, STOP IT.

126
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,322
THESE ARE WILD ANIMALS.

127
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:25,892
THEY HOWL AT THE MOON,
EAT RATS, TRAVEL IN GROUPS,

128
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,394
AND HUNT OUT
THE WEAK AND THE SICK.

129
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,329
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO WITH

130
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,231
MY ORIGINAL ANSWER ON THIS.

131
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,337
THESE ANIMALS
HARDLY EVER HURT HUMANS.

132
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,273
OH.

133
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:48,281
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GIVE ME
ANOTHER CLUE ON THAT ONE.

134
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,550
DESCRIBE YOUR WIFE'S SIDE
OF THE FAMILY EATING.

135
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,651
WOLVES.

136
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,020
THAT WAS
IT!

137
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,859
THIS WEEK ON
"HANDYMAN CORNER",

138
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,627
WE'RE GONNA DO ONE OF
THE MOST COMMON,

139
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,263
AND YET, ONE OF THE MOST
DIFFICULT HANDYMAN PROJECTS.

140
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,232
WE'RE GONNA HANG A DOOR.

141
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:09,035
HERE WE HAVE
A PORTABLE WASHROOM

142
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:09,869
WHOSE DOOR HAS BEEN RIPPED OFF

143
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,271
DURING SOME KIND OF
A GASTRONOMICAL EMERGENCY.

144
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,440
AND OVER HERE, WE HAVE A DOOR.

145
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,977
SO WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO
IS GET THESE TWO TOGETHER.

146
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,979
FIRST, MAKE SURE THAT THE DOOR

147
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:23,015
IS THE SAME SIZE AS
THE HOLE IT'S GOTTA GO IN.

148
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,817
NO -- A LITTLE TOO TALL.

149
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:29,021
SO, WE'LL JUST MARK HER,
AND...

150
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,024
NO LEAD IN MY PENCIL.

151
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,060
WE'VE ALL BE THERE,
HAVEN'T WE?

152
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,964
I'LL TELL YA,
CAR KEY WORKS JUST AS WELL.

153
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,466
MARK HER UP...

154
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:43,136
AND THEN CUT OFF THE EXCESS.

155
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:56,649
ALL RIGHT,
GOT OUR DOOR CUT NOW.

156
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:57,417
ALL WE GOTTA DO

157
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,820
IS MARK WHERE THE HINGES GO,
STICK THEM ON.

158
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,255
OH.

159
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,892
YOU SEE THE PROBLEM
WE GOT HERE.

160
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,226
WE'VE CUT FAR ENOUGH
INTO THE DOOR

161
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:09,662
THAT WE'RE INTO
THE HOLLOW SECTION,

162
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,164
THAT'S NO GOOD,

163
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,266
'CAUSE WE'LL GET RAIN AND
SHINGLES AND HORNET'S NESTS,

164
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,067
ANYTHING THAT FALLS OFF --

165
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:18,171
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S A REAL SIMPLE SOLUTION.

166
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,672
FLIP HER OVER.

167
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:23,776
JUST MARK WHERE THE HINGES GO,
AND STICK 'EM ON THERE.

168
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,383
I'VE GOT THE HINGES MARKED.

169
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,951
I GOT TO CUT THESE OUT.

170
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,120
ORDINARILY,
I WOULD USE A CHISEL,

171
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,955
BUT, I DON'T HAVE A CHISEL.

172
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,391
I DID HAVE A CHISEL, BUT
I HAD IT FOR MORE THAN A WEEK,

173
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,526
SO IT'S MORE OF A SCREWDRIVER.

174
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,996
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
YOU USE THEM AS A HAMMER.

175
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:46,599
I'M GOING TO USE
THE HINGE ITSELF.

176
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,502
THAT WAY I KNOW
I'LL HAVE A PERFECT FIT.

177
00:07:55,975 --> 00:08:01,314
YOU MIGHT WANT TO HAVE A COUPLE
OF EXTRA HINGES, JUST IN CASE.

178
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,815
WE'RE ALL SET.

179
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:06,686
JUST... ATTACH OUR HINGES
TO OUR DOOR JAMB,

180
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,454
JUST LIKE THIS.

181
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,225
SEE WHAT YOU'VE DONE HERE?

182
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,228
YOU'VE MOUNTED THE HINGES
ON THE WRONG SIDE.

183
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,497
NOW THE DOOR IS GOING TO
OPEN IN.

184
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,165
THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.

185
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,300
PLUS, REAL DANGEROUS IN A FIRE.

186
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:25,104
AND AROUND THE LODGE
WE HAVE PLENTY OF THOSE.

187
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,606
YOU KNOW WHAT?

188
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,541
DEAD EASY TO FIX.

189
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,912
NOT THAT EASY.

190
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:39,418
I FIND IT A LOT EASIER TO PUT
THE SCREWS IN WITH A HAMMER

191
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,954
THAN IT IS GETTING
ALL THOSE BLISTERS

192
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,057
FROM A SCREWDRIVER --
OH, NO, THAT'S A CHISEL.

193
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:47,527
SO JUST TAKE HER OVER NOW,

194
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:50,496
AND MOUNT HER
ON THE SIDE THERE.

195
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:54,367
AND JUST... HORSE HER IN.

196
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,138
AND SHE'S JUST THAT EASY.

197
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,374
ISN'T THAT A BEAUTIFUL JOB?

198
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,276
YOU CAN MAKE A FEW--

199
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:04,810
THERE'S ALWAYS ADJUSTMENTS.

200
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,447
YOU CAN CUT THAT OFF --
NO, THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

201
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:10,583
I GOT AN IDEA.

202
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,022
(Engine starting)

203
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,696
WHERE THERE'S A VAN
THERE'S A WAY.

204
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,332
BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL JOB.

205
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,502
SO REMEMBER, IF WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

206
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,971
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST FIND YOU
HANDY.

207
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,806
THEY'LL FIND ME IN THE SHED.

208
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,475
(Door handle rattling)

209
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,344
AHH.

210
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:46,552
WHATEVER THIS IS,
WE GOT A LOT MORE OF IT.

211
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,895
I WANNA TALK TO YOU OLD GUYS

212
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:59,198
ABOUT TELLING STORIES
THAT NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR.

213
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,634
YOU KNOW, IN HOLLYWOOD,

214
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,136
THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A SYSTEM
FOR TELLING STORIES.

215
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,372
SAY, FOR INSTANCE,
YOU HAVE A MOVIE IDEA.

216
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:10,242
I'VE GOT LOTS, BUT, ANYWAY,
A PROFESSIONAL BEGINS WITH

217
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:13,312
A CONCISE PREMISE
OF ONE OR TWO SENTENCES.

218
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,015
SOMETHING LIKE, A METEOROLOGIST
AND HIS EX-WIFE

219
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,651
CHASE TORNADOES
ACROSS THE MID-WEST

220
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,520
AND A BUNCH OF
SPECIAL EFFECTS HAPPEN!

221
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,525
IF PEOPLE LIKE THAT --
ONLY IF THEY LIKE THAT,

222
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:27,560
YOU CAN GO ON AND TELL
THE TREATMENT.

223
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,696
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT
LONGER VERSION.

224
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,131
IF THEY LIKE THAT,

225
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,001
YOU CAN GO INTO
THE FULL-BLOWN SCREENPLAY.

226
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,502
THAT'S TWO HOURS.

227
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,437
SO, YOU SEE HOW THEY DO THAT?

228
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,773
THEY TELL A LITTLE BIT
OF THE STORY

229
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,875
TO SEE IF PEOPLE
ARE INTERESTED.

230
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:46,445
YOU OLD GUYS,
YOU MIGHT WANNA TRY THAT.

231
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,516
NEXT TIME YOU
SEE A BUNCH OF TEENAGERS

232
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,252
TALKING ABOUT
SOMETHING REALLY INTERESTING,

233
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,588
LIKE THE NEW
ALANIS MORRISETTE C.D.,

234
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,525
AND IT REMINDS YOU OF
ONE OF YOUR AMUSING STORIES,

235
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:03,095
DON'T LAUNCH RIGHT INTO
THE TWO-HOUR VERSION.

236
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,097
SEE IF YOU CAN GET
THEIR ATTENTION

237
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,400
WITH SOMETHING LIKE,
"ONE TIME I, UH,

238
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,069
"I HAD TO CHANGE A TIRE
IN THE RAIN

239
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,204
"ON THE WAY TO A WEDDING."

240
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:17,209
(Laughing)

241
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:21,280
IF YOU'RE MET WITH COLD STARES,
DON'T TELL THE STORY.

242
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,015
PITCH OUT ANOTHER IDEA.

243
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:29,155
"DID I TELL YOU ABOUT THE TIME
I STEPPED IN A BIRTHDAY CAKE?"

244
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:32,491
IF THEY'RE INTERESTED,
ONLY IF THEY'RE INTERESTED,

245
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,393
GO ON WITH A LONGER VERSION.

246
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,663
BUT, AS FAR AS THE TWO-HOUR
VERSION IS CONCERNED,

247
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,733
TRUST ME, WE'RE WILLING TO WAIT
FOR THE VIDEO.

248
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,170
REMEMBER, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

249
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,905
DON'T PUSH IT.

250
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,743
(Sighing)

251
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,244
(Audience laughing)

252
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,981
TWO HOURS AGO, BUSTER'S HOUSE
WAS A SMOULDERING RUIN.

253
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,651
NOW HIS NEW PLACE IS READY
TO MOVE IN.

254
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,519
WHEN THE LODGE MEMBERS
COME TOGETHER,

255
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,455
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN'T DO.

256
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:05,858
BIG WHOOP!
PUTTING UP A HOUSE -- WAAAHH!

257
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,393
IT WAS A PRE-FAB HOME.

258
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,764
IT ARRIVED IN A TRUCK,
TAKEN OFF BY A CRANE.

259
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,766
ALL THEY DID WAS SIT AROUND
IN LAWN CHAIRS

260
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,168
AND HECKLE
THE POOR CRANE OPERATOR.

261
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,737
GUY GOT SO NERVOUS,

262
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,939
HE DIDN'T PUT IT
ON BUSTER'S PROPERTY.

263
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,273
(Audience laughing)

264
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,709
HAROLD, WHEN SOMEBODY
SAYS "SHUT UP",

265
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,178
IT'S NOT ADVICE
YOU CAN TAKE OR LEAVE.

266
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,913
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO IT.

267
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,016
I GIVE YOU ADVICE
AND YOU DON'T TAKE IT.

268
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,285
WE'RE NOT
EQUALS, HAROLD.

269
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,554
I KNOW, BUT I DON'T HOLD THAT
OVER YOU.

270
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,223
(Laughing)

271
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,694
BUSTER'S HOUSE IS WHERE
IT SHOULD BE, THANKS TO US.

272
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,263
WE CHIPPED IN
AND BUSTER GOT A GREAT DEAL.

273
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,132
A HOME, HUH?

274
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,399
IT'S A HOUSEBOAT.

275
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,435
HEY, HEY, COME ON!

276
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,904
BUSTER'S KIDS GOT A ROOF
OVER THEIR HEAD,

277
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,839
A BACK PORCH BIG ENOUGH
TO TAKE AN OUTBOARD MOTOR,

278
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,108
AND A BASEMENT
THAT WILL NEVER FLOOD.

279
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,477
IT'S THE UGLIEST THING
I'VE EVER SEEN.

280
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:01,447
SHOW SOME RESPECT --
THAT'S BUSTER'S HOUSE.

281
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,382
IT'S MORE LIKE
BUSTER'S ARK.

282
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:06,752
WELL, IF IT IS, HAROLD,
YOU CAN'T GET ON IT

283
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,721
'CAUSE WE'LL NEVER FIND
TWO LIKE YOU.

284
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,756
(Audience laughing)

285
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,163
UM... HI, MY NAME'S BUZZ.

286
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,063
I'M A MAN.

287
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,999
(Harold):
HEY, BUZZ!
HI, BUZZ.

288
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,468
UM... I ACTED LIKE A GUY
YESTERDAY.

289
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:23,936
(Red): OH, BOY.

290
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,105
I REALLY COULDN'T
HELP MYSELF, RIGHT?

291
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:29,441
SHE'S GOT THIS FOOD PROCESSOR
AND IT BROKE.

292
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:30,843
IT WAS STUCK ON "MINCE".

293
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,346
SHE SAID, "I'LL TAKE THAT
TO THE REPAIR SHOP."

294
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,448
I SAID, "WHOA! LET ME FIX IT!"

295
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:37,983
SHE SAID, "NO! THANK YOU.

296
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,019
"REMEMBER WHAT YOU DID
TO MY T.V.?

297
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,388
"REMEMBER WHAT YOU DID
TO MY BLOW-DRYER?

298
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,757
"REMEMBER WHAT YOU DID TO MY
TYPEWRITER AND YOGURT-MAKER?"

299
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:45,424
I SAID, "WHAT'S THE POINT?"

300
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:46,258
SHE SAID, "SO..."

301
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,527
I SAID, "I WON'T TOUCH IT."

302
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,398
SHE LEFT IT ON THE COUNTER,
A BROKEN FOOD PROCESSOR.

303
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,699
HOW CAN WOMEN DO THAT?

304
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:57,436
YOU GOTTA TAKE IT APART
AND SEE WHAT'S WRONG!

305
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:58,871
YOU GOTTA!

306
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,874
I DIDN'T TOUCH IT.

307
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,542
ALL WEEK, I WALKED BY.

308
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,911
IT'S TAUNTING ME,
TALKING TO ME.

309
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:07,947
IT'S SAYING, "I'M BROKEN --
YOU CAN'T TOUCH ME.

310
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,348
"YOU CAN'T FIX ME."

311
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,384
I WANTED TO TAKE-- I DIDN'T.

312
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:13,919
ONE NIGHT, I SNAPPED.

313
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:17,122
SHE WENT OUT TO BINGO
AND I GOT MY TOOLS OUT.

314
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,993
I TOOK THAT FOOD PROCESSOR
AND I RIPPED 'ER WIDE OPEN!

315
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,396
I-I-I COULDN'T FIX IT,
YOU KNOW.

316
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,832
(Audience laughing)

317
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:28,734
BUT I PUT IT BACK TOGETHER

318
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:32,004
AND IT LOOKED ALMOST EXACTLY
THE SAME AS IT USED TO.

319
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,706
YOU KNOW... SHE CAME HOME.

320
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,275
SHE TOOK ONE LOOK AT ME.

321
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,043
SHE LOOKED AT THE BLENDER.

322
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,912
SHE SAID, "YOU TRIED
TO FIX IT, DIDN'T YOU?"

323
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,013
(Harold): AWW!

324
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,214
WHAT GAVE YOU AWAY?

325
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,884
THE DUCT TAPE.

326
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,087
(Audience laughing)

327
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:51,724
"A POEM BY ALFRED,
LORD TENNYSON... GREEN.

328
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,494
"HALF A LEAGUE, HALF A LEAGUE,
HALF A LEAGUE ONWARD,

329
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,497
"ALL IN THE VALLEY OF DEATH
RODE THE 600,

00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:02,268

THEIRS NOT TO REASON WHY,

00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,236

335
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,146
(Audience laughing)

336
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,816
(Red): WELL, TIME FOR
"ADVENTURES WITH BILL".

337
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,852
GONNA DO THE HIGH-WIRE THING.

338
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,887
EARLIER, WE FREED UP
THE FLAGPOLE

339
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,622
SO HE CAN ACTUALLY USE THAT.

340
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,524
THAT'S THE WAY
HE USES FLAGPOLES.

341
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,326
THAT'S THE TROUBLE WITH BILL.

342
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:28,794
HE'S GONNA USE THAT TO--

343
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,797
YOU KNOW THEY HAVE
THE BALANCE BAR THAT THEY USE.

344
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,132
WELL, THAT'S-- OHHH!

345
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:34,566
BILL'S A DANGEROUS MAN.

346
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,169
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET HIM
ON THE HIGH-WIRE.

347
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,804
I'LL TAKE ONE END OF THE ROPE.

348
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,239
I'M GONNA HOOK THAT

349
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,975
ONTO ONE OF OUR BIGGER TREES,
AND BILL'S GOT

350
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,144
THE CONCRETE BLOCK,
AND I'LL WHIP THAT AROUND

351
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,980
AND TIE THAT ON
IN, I THINK, A REEF HITCH.

352
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:52,084
AND THEN BILL'S GONNA WEDGE
THAT BLOCK INTO THE TREE

353
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,586
AND THEN WE'LL TIGHTEN THE ROPE

354
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,021
BETWEEN THE BLOCK AND--

355
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,957
LOOK AT THAT,
LOOK AT THAT, HUH?

356
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:01,660
THERE HE IS!
HE'S LIKE A WALLENDA.

357
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,562
YOU EVER HEARD
OF THE WALLENDAS?

358
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,497
THEY'RE A FAMOUS CIRCUS FAMILY.

359
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,032
IF THERE EVER WAS
A CIRCUS FAMILY,

360
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,567
IT'S BILL'S, I'M FIGURING.

361
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,769
LOOK AT THAT --
OF COURSE, WITH BILL,

362
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:14,139
SOON AS HE GETS ANYWHERE CLOSE
TO DOING SOMETHING RIGHT,

363
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,841
HE FEELS LIKE
HE'S ON TOP OF IT.

364
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,242
HE CAN-- HE'S COCKY.

365
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,845
THERE YOU GO --
YOU DON'T NEED THAT, DO YA?

366
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,314
WITH THE WALLENDAS, THOUGH --
WAIT A MINUTE.

367
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,283
WEREN'T THEY
"THE FLYING WALLENDAS"?

368
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,785
WHY WERE THEY CALLED
"THE FLYING WALLENDAS"?

369
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,487
OHHHH!
OH, I SEE.

370
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:31,790
SO WHAT WE DID WAS
WE ADDED MORE WEIGHT.

371
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:34,426
I HAD TO ADD MORE BLOCKS
SO THERE WAS

372
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:37,129
MORE WEIGHT ON THE THING,
AND WE HAD A LADDER.

373
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:40,766
WE TOOK A KID'S BIKE,
TOOK THE TIRES OFF.

374
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,969
WITH THE TIRES OFF,
THE RIMS WILL SIT ON THE ROPE

375
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,571
AND, LIKE I SAY, WITH BILL,

376
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,006
ONCE HE GETS CLOSE
TO SOMETHING,

377
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,842
HE TRIES TO MAKE IT SO HARD
THAT HE CAN'T DO IT.

378
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,578
KINDA LIKE THE PETER PRINCIPLE
OF ADVENTURES.

379
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,680
THIS COULD BE
THE PETER ADVENTURES,

380
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:55,714
ADVENTURES WITH PETER.

381
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,850
PETER... PETER...
PETER... UH...

382
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,184
NO, IT WON'T WORK.

383
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:00,652
SO HE GETS ON THE BIKE.

384
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,454
GET ON THERE, AWAY YOU GO.

385
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,023
ON YOU GET, ON YOU GET.

386
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,657
AWAY YOU GO, ON YOU GET.

387
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:08,160
AWAY, ON, ON, ON,
ON, ON, ON, ON, ON.

388
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,829
THERE, AND BY GOLLY, I THINK

389
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:12,765
THE FLAGPOLE IS THE SECRET.

390
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:15,367
AND JUST, YOU KNOW,
A WORD OF SAFETY --

391
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,669
DON'T STAND CLOSE TO BILL.

392
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:21,140
HE COULD BE CROSSING
NIAGARA FALLS, COULDN'T HE,

393
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,742
ON HIS BIKE, AND EVERYTHING.
AND THEN, YOU KNOW

394
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:27,146
WHAT HAPPENS, HE THINKS,
"WOULDN'T IT BE FUN TO BOUNCE?"

395
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,480
WHICH HE OFTEN SAYS

396
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,083
AT PARTIES AND
HE GETS GOING TOO MUCH

397
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,151
THERE GOES THE POLE AND

398
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,752
THE BLOCKS FALL AND HE GOES

399
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,220
LIKE A SLINGSHOT.

400
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:36,455
AWAY YOU GO, BILL!

401
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,424
OH, OH, OH! OH, BOY!

402
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,758
OHHH!

403
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,361
BY GOLLY, NOW,
THAT HAS GOTTA HURT.

404
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:45,664
THAT'S WHY, AT THE CIRCUS,
YOU PAY UP-FRONT.

405
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,266
ALL RIGHT, THERE, BILL?

406
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,600
OHHH...

407
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:51,537
HE'LL BE ON HIS BIKE AWHILE,
I'D SAY.

408
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,539
HERE'S THE POSSUM LODGE OATH,

409
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:56,508
ALL DONE IN NEEDLEPOINT,
SENT BY A VIEWER.

410
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,015
I SAID THAT WASN'T
BUSTER'S PROPERTY.

411
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,350
I SAID, "YOU'RE BUILDING
ON THE WRONG LAND.

412
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,019
"BUSTER'S ENDS AT THE FENCE."

413
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,353
I TOLD YOU!

414
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:10,756
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME

415
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,792
WHEN THE CRANE WAS HERE
AND WE COULD MOVE THE HOUSE?

416
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,428
I TOLD YOU WHEN
YOU PICKED THE SPOT!

417
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:20,099
I SAID, "BUSTER'S PROPERTY ENDS
AT THE FENCE."

418
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,800
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY IT LOUDER?

419
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:24,103
I DID SAY IT LOUDER
AND I SAID IT SEVERAL TIMES.

420
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,737
YOU TOLD ME TO SHUT UP.

421
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,508
WHY DIDN'T YOU PERSIST?

422
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,410
YOU CAN'T STOP DOING SOMETHING

423
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,012
JUST 'CAUSE SOMEBODY TELLS YOU
TO SHUT UP.

424
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:34,847
IF I PERSIST--

425
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,281
OH, SHUT UP, HAROLD.

426
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,685
WELL, ANYWAY,
WE GOT BUSTER'S HOUSE NOW

427
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,553
50 FEET OFF HIS PROPERTY.

428
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,189
WE WANTED TO PICK A GOOD SITE
WITH A NICE VIEW

429
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:48,026
AND A WAYS UP FROM THE SMOKING
RUIN OF HIS OLD PLACE.

430
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,028
NOW WE GOTTA MOVE HIS HOUSE,

431
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:52,531
DO THE OLD CHANGE-OF-ADDRESS
THING.

432
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,167
YOU'RE GONNA DRAG
THAT HOUSEBOAT

433
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:58,337
OVER 50 FEET OF ROCKY,
WELL-TREED LAND?

434
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,239
WE'RE NOT STUPID, HAROLD.

435
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,242
(Audience laughing)

436
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,210
JUNIOR SINGLETON SAYS
IF WE GREASE THE HILL,

437
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,979
WE CAN SLIDE 'ER DOWN.

438
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:09,314
(Audience laughing)

439
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:10,849
(Laughing)

440
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:16,688
WANNA TELL YOU TEENAGERS
YOU'RE NOT FOOLING ANYBODY.

441
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,924
YOUR PARENTS KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

442
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,727
YOU THINK THEY DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GOING,

443
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:25,097
WHAT YOU'RE UP TO, THE PEOPLE
YOU'RE HANGING OUT WITH?

444
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,300
NOT THAT LONG AGO, THEY WERE
DOING THE SAME THINGS.

445
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,068
THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW.

446
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:32,304
OTHERWISE, YOU'D THINK
LESS OF THEM.

447
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,705
BELIEVE ME, THEY KNOW.

448
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,374
ARE YOU WITH A PARENT NOW?

449
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,875
YOU SEE THAT GRIN?

450
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,444
THEY MAY SAY THEY DON'T KNOW
BUT THEY KNOW,

451
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,380
AND NOW YOU KNOW
THAT THEY KNOW.

452
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:42,714
IF THEY WON'T ADMIT

453
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,149
YOU KNOW THEY KNOW
THAT THEY KNOW YOU KNOW,

454
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,785
ASK YOUR GRANDPARENTS,
'CAUSE THEY
 REALLY
 KNOW.

455
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,587
IF THEY SAY
THEY DON'T REMEMBER,

456
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,789
THAT MEANS YOUR PARENTS
BOUGHT 'EM OFF

457
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,358
OR THERE'S A COURT ORDER
AND NO ONE CAN TALK.

458
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:54,826
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

459
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,429
YOUR PARENTS WERE BIG-TIME
PROBLEM TEENAGERS.

460
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,799
THAT INCREASES THE SLACK
ON YOUR LEASH BY 100 MILES!

461
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,801
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW!

462
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,736
(Audience laughing)

463
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,774
IT'S "MALE CALL"!

464
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,043
(Audience laughing)

465
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,378
OK.

466
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:16,748
OUR FIRST LETTER IS FROM
MR. PEA CHES IN ATLANTA.

467
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:17,749
WHO?

468
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,952
MR. PEA CHES
IN ATLANTA.

469
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:22,020
PEACHES? IS THAT THE NAME?

470
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,122
YEAH, PEA CHES -- HOO-HOO!

471
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:28,927
"DEAR RED, MY BROTHER MAT CHES
AND I ARE FANS OF YOUR SHOW."

472
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,563
MATCHES? HER BROTHER'S NAME
IS MATCHES?

473
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,898
WHO?
PEACHES.

474
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,167
PEA CHES IS A HE.

475
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,668
A BOY NAMED PEACHES?!

476
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,272
WHAT PARENTS NAME THEIR BOYS
PEACHES AND MATCHES?

477
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,274
WELL... WELL, LET'S SEE.

478
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:45,444
THEIR PARENTS' NAMES
ARE RET CHES AND BEL CHES.

479
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:46,979
RETCHES
AND BELCHES?

480
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,015
WHERE DO THESE
NAMES COME FROM?

481
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:53,385
THEY'RE SOUTHERN PEOPLE --
THEY INCLUDED A FAMILY PHOTO.

482
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:54,620
THAT'S THE WHOLE CHES FAMILY.

483
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,022
THERE'S RET AND BEL,
PEA AND MAT.

484
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,958
PEACHES, MATCHES,
RETCHES, AND BELCHES.

485
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,727
SOUNDS LIKE A LAW FIRM.

486
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,663
MAKES YOU WANT TO
SETTLE OUT OF COURT.

487
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,236
WELL, GOOD NEWS.

488
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,073
WE SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF
BUSTER'S NEW HOUSE BEING BUILT

489
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:17,009
ON SOMEBODY ELSE'S PROPERTY.

490
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:19,878
WITH A LITTLE INGENUITY,
WE GOT HIS HOUSE

491
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,614
ON THE RIGHT SIDE
OF THE BOUNDARY LINE.

492
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,783
YOU MOVED THAT HOUSEBOAT
OVER 50 FEET?

493
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,686
NO, WE MOVED THE FENCE
OVER 50 FEET.

494
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:30,188
NO, UNCLE RED,
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

495
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:31,890
THAT'S SOMEONE
ELSE'S PROPERTY.

496
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,027
IT'S FLINTY McCLINTOCK'S
PROPERTY -- HE DIDN'T MIND.

497
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:38,263
HE MOVED HIS FAR FENCE
45 FEET ONTO MOOSE THOMPSON'S.

498
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,732
THEN MOOSE MOVED HIS FENCE
OVER 40 FEET

499
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,234
AND BOB STUYVESANT'S 35
AND SO ON,

500
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,835
ALL THE WAY DOWN THE LINE.

501
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:47,439
EVERYBODY GAVE UP FIVE FEET
AND GOT THEIR FENCE REPAIRED.

502
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,408
THAT'S WHAT NEIGHBOURS ARE FOR.

503
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,143
WOW, THAT'S NEAT,
UNCLE RED.

504
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,811
THAT'S A REAL
PIONEER SPIRIT.

505
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:54,813
I AM VERY
IMPRESSED.

506
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,081
YOU MAY NOT BE.

507
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,984
THE LAST FIVE FEET WAS ONTO
YOUR PARENTS' PROPERTY

508
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,620
AND YOUR BEDROOM
WAS RIGHT ON THE LINE

509
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,188
SO YOUR BEDROOM IS NOW

510
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:04,890
ON SOMEONE ELSE'S LAND

511
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:06,591
AND YOU ARE
OLD MAN SEDGWICK'S SON.

512
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,493
(Audience laughing)

513
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:11,363
(Possum squeal)

514
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,532
MEETING TIME.

515
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:14,666
ARE YOU STILL
MY UNCLE?

516
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,134
YOU GO DOWN
AND SAY HELLO TO DAD.

517
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:18,203
OHHHH!

518
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:21,940
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,
I'VE HAD QUITE A DAY.

519
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,876
I PUT OUT A BURNING HOUSE,
BURIED A BUDGIE,

520
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:26,278
REPLACED A HOUSE
WITH A HOUSEBOAT,

521
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:28,914
AND RE-DREW THE BOUNDARY LINES
ACROSS THE WHOLE COMMUNITY.

522
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,015
YOU KNOW WHAT?

523
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,750
I DESERVE A REWARD.

524
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:34,953
THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

525
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:37,456
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND HAROLD SEDGWICK

526
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:41,226
AND THE GANG AT POSSUM LODGE,
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

527
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:45,097
(Applause and cheering)

528
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:48,800
(Possum squeal)

529
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:54,740
(Harold): STAND UP!

530
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:56,808
RISE AND SHINE!

531
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:04,750
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

532
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,984
(Red): WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND,
HAROLD?

533
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,720
(Harold): YOU KNOW
THAT COMMERCIAL, IT SAYS

534
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,721
FOUR OUT OF FIVE DENTISTS,

535
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,989
RECOMMEND SUGARLESS GUM?

536
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,258
THAT 5th DENTIST IS MOVING HERE

537
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:13,992
SO YOU CAN EAT

538
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,460
WHATEVER YOU WANT.
