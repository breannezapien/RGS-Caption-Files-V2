THE MAN WITH THE
PERSONALITY AS BIG
AS ALL OUTDOORS,

00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:30,296
THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

YEAH, YEAH.
APPRECIATE IT.

9
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,134
BIG, BIG WEEK UP
AT THE LODGE
THIS WEEK.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,269
GOT OUR FIRST INTERNATIONAL
BREAKTHROUGH.

11
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:39,372
I SOLD THE SHOW
TO EUROPE.

12
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,442
EXCUSE ME, 'YOU' SOLD THE SHOW?

13
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,610
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

14
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:47,013
GREAT NEWS, WE SOLD
THE SHOW TO EUROPE.

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,549
'WE' SOLD THE SHOW?
UNCLE RED, 'I' SOLD THE SHOW.

16
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:50,884
YEAH, ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,453
EUROPE BOUGHT THE SHOW.

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,355
EUROPE DID NOT BUY THE SHOW.

19
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:58,958
EUROPE'S NOT A COUNTRY.

20
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:02,061
YES, YES, WE SOLD IT TO
A COUNTRY IN EUROPE
BUT NOT TO EUROPE.

21
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:04,864
WHY? BECAUSE EUROPE
IS NOT A COUNTRY.

22
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:08,101
HE THOUGHT EUROPE
WAS A COUNTRY.

23
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:11,104
AND HE THOUGHT
I CARED.

24
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,439
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
SWEDEN BOUGHT THE SHOW.

25
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:17,744
WE'RE SEEN IN SWEDEN NOW,
SO BONJOUR, SWEDEN.

26
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,479
NOT SWEDEN, IT'S SWITZERLAND.

27
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:22,448
WELL, IT'S THE
SAME THING, HAROLD.

28
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:25,351
IT'S LIKE HOLLAND AND THE
NETHERLANDS: THE SAME THING.

29
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,187
OR QUEBEC AND "K" BECK,
YOU KNOW, SAME.

30
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:32,191
CHINA AND JAPAN, YOU KNOW?
IT'S THE SAME PLACE;
DIFFERENT NAMES.

31
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,028
SWEDEN AND SWITZERLAND,
THAT'S THE SAME COUNTRY.

32
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:38,698
HELLO, THERE,
YOU SWISS SWEDES,
WHEREVER YOU ARE --

33
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,933
IN EUROPE, I 'M PRETTY
SURE ABOUT THAT.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,835
NO, NO, NO, UNCLE RED, NO.

35
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:44,771
SWEDEN AND SWITZERLAND, I MEAN,
THEY GOT, LIKE, TWO DIFFERENT
LANGUAGES, YOU KNOW?

36
00:01:44,837 --> 00:01:46,506
THEY LIVE COMPLETELY
SEPARATE LIVES,

37
00:01:46,572 --> 00:01:48,875
AND THEY HAVE NO SIMILAR
HISTORY OR CULTURE OR ANYTHING.

38
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:52,245
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,
WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY IS THAT?

39
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:53,980
CANADA.

KIND OF SAD, ISN'T IT?

00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,477
IMAGINE THE STUFF WE LEFT
OUT OF THIS THING.

45
00:02:35,888 --> 00:02:37,156
SWITZERLAND.

46
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,192
YEAH, SWITZERLAND, WHATEVER.

47
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:40,827
WELL, THE MEDIA'S JUMPIN'
ALL OVER IT TOO.

SOME BIG AMERICAN NETWORK

POWER OF HYPE.

57
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,585

HYPE IS COOL.

GOOD LOOKS, BRAINS, NOTHING

YOU KNOW, I'M THINKING
HYPE COULD REALLY
HELP YOU, HAROLD.

YOU'RE HYPER NOW, SO JUST
BACK OFF ONE LETTER,

ELSE ABOUT THESE SWEDES.

AND WITH GIFTS TOO.

O-O-O-H.

O-O-O-H, I LOVE THESE.

68
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:30,910
IT'S A SWISS ARMY KNIFE.

69
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,311
OH, THESE ARE GREAT,
THEY GOT EVERYTHING.

70
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,380
THEY MUST REALLY LIKE ME.
THEY GOT EVERYTHING.
LOOK AT THAT.

71
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:39,051
IT'S GOT A PENKNIFE AND A
CARVING KNIFE AND A SCALING
KNIFE AND A STEAK KNIFE,
A FORK AND SPOON;

72
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,987
AND THERE'S A CORKSCREW
AND A BOTTLE OPENER AND
A MAGNIFYING GLASS;

73
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:45,324
THERE'S A PENCIL SHARPENER,
A PENCIL, PEN, ERASER,
WIRE CUTTERS;

74
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,127
AND, RIGHT THERE, LOOK AT THAT,
YOU GOT, LIKE, A WOOD FILE
THING, THERE;

75
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:51,364
YOU GOT NAIL CLIPPERS, AND YOU
GOT, LIKE, SIX DIFFERENT KINDS
OF SCREWDRIVERS --

76
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,867
THAT'S HARD TO GET IN THERE, SIX
DIFFERENT KINDS OF SCREWDRIVERS.
THEY'RE ALL RIGHT INSIDE THERE.

77
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:59,171
YOU GOT, LIKE, A GUITAR PICK,
AN ALLEN KEY, AND THERE'S
A SKELETON KEY.

78
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:01,440
OH, THIS IS FANTASTIC.

79
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:04,744
OH, AND, LOOK, RIGHT DEEP
INSIDE THERE, THAT'S THE
LATEST VERSION OF "DOOM."

80
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,878
THAT'S SO GREAT.

81
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,747
THAT'S FOR ME.

82
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:12,485
(APPLAUSE)

83
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:13,886
THEY LIKE ME
SO MUCH OVER THERE.

84
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:16,789
BOY, I LIKE YOU TOO.

85
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,058
SO WHAT DID
YOU GET?

86
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:23,195
OH, I GOT A LITTLE
CHOCOLATE BAR, HAROLD.

87
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:25,631
O-O-O-H, THAT'S --
THAT'S A LOT
OF CHOCOLATE.

88
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:28,534
IT'S SO REALLY, REALLY
BIG, ISN'T IT?

89
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,469
THAT'S -- IT'S --
THAT'S CHOCOLATE.

90
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,605
O-O-O-H.

91
00:04:32,671 --> 00:04:34,139
YOU'RE GOING TO SHARE IT,
THOUGH, WITH ME, RIGHT?

92
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:35,341
WELL, SURE, I'LL
GIVE YOU THE BOX.

93
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:37,676
YOU CAN MAKE A
PERISCOPE, THERE.

94
00:04:37,743 --> 00:04:42,581
HAROLD, REALLY, YOU EAT
THIS MUCH CHOCOLATE, YOU'LL
TURN INTO A BIG, PLAID ZIT.

95
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:44,984
THAT'S NOT EVEN TRUE.
I TALKED TO MY DOCTOR,

96
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,620
AND HE SAID YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT MEDICINE.

97
00:04:47,686 --> 00:04:49,255
YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT
WHAT GIVES PEOPLE ZITS,

98
00:04:49,321 --> 00:04:53,559
AND YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT WHAT
MAKES TEENAGERS GO BLIND TOO.

99
00:04:57,663 --> 00:04:59,498
OH, HE POPS A WHEELIE
RIGHT BY THE DOOR

100
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:01,267
THE TIRES ARE SMOKIN' GOOD.

101
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,068
HE MISSES A SHIFT
FROM SECOND TO THIRD

102
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:05,104
AND A FLAME POPS UP
UNDER THE HOOD

103
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,872
HE HITS THE WALL IN A
FOUR-WHEEL DRIFT

104
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,807
BUT THAT'S THE PRICE YOU PAY

105
00:05:08,874 --> 00:05:10,776
WHEN YOU GO TO THE
FANCY HOTEL IN TOWN

106
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:15,114
HAND YOUR CAR
KEYS TO THE VALET

107
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,683
YOU KNOW, THE FREEDOM OF THE
OPEN ROAD APPEALS TO MOST MEN.

108
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,986
I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE SO MANY
OF US ARE STUCK IN LIFE'S DITCH.

109
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:24,256
IT'S BETTER TO BE A CHILD OF THE
ROAD THAN A SON OF A DITCH.

110
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:25,858
IS THERE NOTHING I WON'T SAY?

111
00:05:25,924 --> 00:05:27,393
WELL, THINK ABOUT THIS ONE.

112
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:30,696
FOR 60 YEARS OR MORE, THE
GREATEST SYMBOL OF FREEDOM

113
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:33,599
HAS BEEN THE FABULOUS
AIRSTREAM TRAILER.

114
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,869
BUT, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THESE
AIRSTREAMS COST MORE THAN
I MAKE IN A DOG-YEAR,

115
00:05:36,935 --> 00:05:38,904
WHICH IS SEVEN HUMAN YEARS.

116
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,739
SO I FIGURED THIS WEEK ON
"HANDYMAN CORNER,"

117
00:05:40,806 --> 00:05:43,142
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO
MAKE YOUR OWN "AIRSTREAM."

118
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,877
I MEAN, WHAT HAVE
YOU GOT HERE?

119
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:47,146
A COUPLE OF WHEELS,
CURVED ALUMINUM BOTTOM,

120
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:50,015
CURVED ALUMINUM TOP,
ALUMINUM SIDES.

121
00:05:50,082 --> 00:05:54,753
YEAH, YOU GOT A FRIDGE AND
STOVE, BUT YOU CAN GET
THAT STUFF ANYWHERE.

122
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,922
FIRST THING I NEED IS
A COUPLE OF WHEELS

123
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:59,658
WHICH WE HAVE RIGHT HERE
ON THIS OLD BOAT TRAILER.

124
00:05:59,725 --> 00:06:02,961
NOW, ALL WE NEED IS
OUR ALUMINUM BOTTOM
AND TOP AND SIDES.

125
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:07,266
WELL, MY GOSH, FOR THE BOTTOM,
THERE'S THIS OLD ALUMINUM BOAT.

126
00:06:07,332 --> 00:06:10,269
AND FOR THE SIDES, I'VE GOT
THESE APPLIANCE DOORS.

127
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:13,639
APPLIANCES ARE MADE OF ALUMINUM
OR SOME KIND OF METAL --

128
00:06:13,705 --> 00:06:15,474
COULD BE ALUMINUM.

129
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,476
AND, LOOK, YOU COULD USE, LIKE,
THIS FRIDGE DOOR AS YOUR
OUTSIDE WALL,

130
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,646
AND ON THE INSIDE,
YOU GOT BUILT-IN AUTOMATIC
STORAGE, THERE, EH?

131
00:06:20,712 --> 00:06:26,051
PUT YOUR EGGS OR YOUR CHEESE
OR YOUR GOLF BALLS OR SCREWS --
DIFFERENT SIZE IN EACH EGGCUP.

132
00:06:26,118 --> 00:06:27,586
HERE'S SOMETHIN'.

133
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,788
YOU WANNA GO UPSCALE A BIT,
HOW ABOUT THIS?

134
00:06:29,855 --> 00:06:34,026
ADD ONE OF THEM FANCY
NAUTICAL-STYLE PORTHOLE
WINDOWS IN THE END.

135
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:38,163
YOU'LL NEED ABOUT, I WOULD SAY,
10-20  APPLIANCES FOR
THE SIDES, THERE.

136
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,600
AND YOU GET TO GLOAT TO YOUR
WIFE ABOUT HOW SMART YOU ARE

137
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:45,671
TO KEEP THOSE APPLIANCES
ON YOUR FRONT PORCH FOR
THE LAST 16 YEARS.

138
00:06:45,737 --> 00:06:48,040
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S
THE BOTTOM AND SIDES.

139
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:51,209
WELL, FOR THE TOP, WE USE
THIS OTHER BOAT, EH?

140
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:56,048
JUST BECAUSE SHE'S NOT
SEAWORTHY, DOESN'T MEAN
SHE'S NOT ROADWORTHY.

141
00:06:56,114 --> 00:06:58,083
OH, YEAH, LOTS OF HEADROOM...

142
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,886
AND SPIDERS.

143
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:04,890
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY OUT.
ALL ASHORE, SPIDERS.

144
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:06,658
MAN, THOSE DOCK SPIDERS
ARE BIG, AREN'T THEY?

145
00:07:06,725 --> 00:07:10,062
OH, OH, OH, GIT OUTTA THERE.
GIT OUT. GIT OUT.

146
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:12,864
MAN, I HAD NO IDEA I WAS
ALLERGIC TO SPIDER BITES.

147
00:07:12,931 --> 00:07:16,034
NOW IT'S TIME TO
START ASSEMBLING
OUR AIRSTREAM TRAILER.

148
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:20,639
OH, NO, NO. HAROLD TOLD ME NOT
TO SAY AIRSTREAM, OR THEY'LL
BE SUING US FOR STEALING
THEIR DESIGN.

149
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,175
ALL RIGHT, WE WANT TO ATTACH
ALUMINUM TO ALUMINUM HERE.

150
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:26,478
WHICH YOU CAN DO WITH A
WELDING TORCH, BUT I DON'T
RECOMMEND THAT BECAUSE THAT
REQUIRES ABILITY,

151
00:07:26,545 --> 00:07:29,114
WHICH PUTS IT OUTSIDE
MY SKILL CHART.

152
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:31,016
AND, OF COURSE, YOU'VE GOT THE
RIVETS AND SCREWS, THERE,

153
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,453
BUT YOU GOT TO BE DEAD ACCURATE
WITH THEM, AND THAT TAKES THE
FUN OUT OF ANY PROJECT.

154
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:37,589
SO, INSTEAD, I RECOMMEND YOU USE
THE HANDYMAN SECRET WEAPON,

155
00:07:37,656 --> 00:07:39,658
DUCT TAPE.

156
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,995
HAND ME ANOTHER
FRIDGE DOOR, HAROLD.

157
00:07:46,164 --> 00:07:48,133
ALRIGHTY.

158
00:07:56,908 --> 00:07:57,776
THERE WE GO.

159
00:07:57,843 --> 00:08:01,046
OOPS, SPIDER! SPIDER!

160
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:02,848
AND THERE'S YOUR VERY OWN
HOUSE TRAILER.

161
00:08:02,914 --> 00:08:07,285
AND ALL IT COST YOU WAS SOME OLD
APPLIANCES AND A COUPLE OF
SPIDER BITES.

162
00:08:07,352 --> 00:08:09,688
I TELL YOU, THAT IS A SMALL
PRICE TO PAY TO HAVE YOUR
OWN AIRSTREAM --

163
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:16,061
OH, NO, I CAN'T SAY AIRSTREAM:
THEY'RE GOING TO BE SUING US
FOR COPYING THEIR DESIGN.

164
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,996
NO, NO, I THINK WE'RE OKAY...

165
00:08:18,063 --> 00:08:20,198
NOT EXACTLY THE SAME.

166
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:22,400
BY THE WAY, DON'T TAPE
THE ROOF ON THERE.

167
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:23,668
LET GRAVITY HOLD HER ON.

168
00:08:23,735 --> 00:08:25,036
THEN, WHEN YOU GET
TO YOUR CAMPSITE,

169
00:08:25,103 --> 00:08:28,073
YOU FLIP HER OFF, YOU GOT
YOURSELF A BOAT, EH?

170
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,909
OKAY, LET'S HOP INSIDE
THROUGH THE UH...

171
00:08:35,747 --> 00:08:37,983
OH, MAN.

172
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:46,925
NOW, WHERE THERE'S A WASHING
MACHINE, THERE'S A WAY.

173
00:08:46,992 --> 00:08:48,893
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE ALL SET
TO HIT THE OPEN ROAD.

174
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,664
AND, BY GOLLY, CAN YOU IMAGINE
THE LOOKS OF ENVY ON THE OTHER
DRIVERS, EH?

175
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:55,433
'CAUSE THEY HAD TO BUY
THEIR HOUSE TRAILER.

176
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,835
YOU DON'T JUST HAVE A HOUSE
TRAILER, HERE,

177
00:08:56,901 --> 00:08:58,737
YOU'VE GOT A HOUSEBOAT.

178
00:08:58,803 --> 00:09:03,174
SO REMEMBER, IF WOMEN DON'T FIND
YOU HANDSOME, THEY SHOULD AT
LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

179
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:06,244
OH, MY GOLLY, THE FRIDGE LIGHT
DOES GO OUT WHEN YOU
CLOSE THE DOOR.

180
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:08,947
I THINK THERE'S A LIGHT IN THE
BUTTER DISH. YEP.

181
00:09:09,014 --> 00:09:10,348
SPIDER!

182
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:15,587
GOT HIM.

183
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,159
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU OLDER
FOLKS ABOUT YOUR KIDS.

184
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:23,228
YOU KNOW WHEN THEY COME
OVER TO VISIT WITH THE
GRANDCHILDREN?

185
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:27,198
AND START ASKING QUESTIONS LIKE,
"HOW MUCH LONGER ARE YOU GOING
TO LIVE IN THIS PLACE?"

186
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:29,968
OR "WHERE ARE YOU GOING
TO LIVE WHEN YOU'RE OLDER?"

187
00:09:30,034 --> 00:09:34,706
OR, THE WORSE ONE: "HOW MUCH
OLDER DO YOU THINK YOU'LL GET?"

188
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:38,543
AT FIRST, YOU THINK IT'S KIND
OF NICE, THEM PAYING ATTENTION
TO YOU AND ALL THAT.

189
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:43,648
AND THEN YOU REALIZE WHEN
THEY'RE HOLDING THE PAINT
CHIPS UP AGAINST THE WALL
WHILE THEY'RE TALKIN' TO YOU,

190
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:46,017
THEY'RE WAITING AROUND
FOR THE INHERITANCE.

191
00:09:46,084 --> 00:09:49,154
SEE, THEY THINK YOU'RE LOADED.

192
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,455
YOU AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE,

193
00:09:50,522 --> 00:09:52,757
BUT THEY DON'T NEED
TO KNOW THAT.

194
00:09:52,824 --> 00:09:57,061
THEY ALSO DON'T NEED TO KNOW
THAT THE DOCTOR SAYS YOU'RE
IN EXCELLENT HEALTH.

195
00:09:57,128 --> 00:09:58,897
KIND OF GO WITH IT A BIT.

196
00:09:58,963 --> 00:10:00,365
YOU KNOW, WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG,
THEY'D NEVER EVEN TALK TO YOU.

197
00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:02,834
NOW, THEY'RE FAWNING
ALL OVER YOU.

198
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:04,869
WELL, GO FOR IT.

199
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:07,572
ENJOY THE ATTENTION THEY'RE
GIVING YOU WHILE THEY SEARCH
FOR THIS MYTHICAL INHERITANCE.

200
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,174
START SAYING THINGS LIKE,

201
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,811
"OH GOLLY, I HAVE LEFT MY
SLIPPERS IN THE OTHER ROOM."

202
00:10:13,878 --> 00:10:17,916
OR "YOU KNOW, I COULD REALLY GO
FOR A COLD BEER RIGHT NOW."

203
00:10:17,982 --> 00:10:19,150
IT'S GOOD FOR THEM.

204
00:10:19,217 --> 00:10:20,251
THEY'LL BE RESPECTIN'
THEIR ELDERS,

205
00:10:20,318 --> 00:10:21,586
AND THEY'RE NOT DOIN'
IT FOR MONEY --

206
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:24,088
THEY JUST DON'T KNOW IT YET.

207
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:27,091
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

208
00:10:27,158 --> 00:10:29,861
(APPLAUSE)

209
00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:37,068
AH, WE HIT A FEW SNAGS WITH THIS
SWITZERLAND SALE THING.

210
00:10:37,135 --> 00:10:38,336
TRYING TO PUSH ME
AROUND A LITTLE.

211
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:40,605
I'D JUST AS SOON TAKE A PASS,
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

212
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:44,042
I FEEL LIKE GIVING THEM BACK
THAT CHEQUE AND EVEN THAT
GIANT CHOCOLATE BAR.

213
00:10:44,108 --> 00:10:46,110
WHERE DID THAT GET TO, HAROLD?

214
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:53,384
(LAUGHTER)

215
00:10:59,557 --> 00:11:02,226
I DON'T KNOW.

216
00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:06,030
SO MUCH FOR CHOCOLATE NOT
AFFECTING YOUR COMPLEXION,
EH, HAROLD?

217
00:11:06,097 --> 00:11:07,298
OH, OKAY. WHAT ABOUT YOU?

218
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:09,701
I THOUGHT THE SWITZERLAND DEAL
WAS A DONE SALE, HUH?

219
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:11,936
HOW'D YOU WRECK THAT?
YOU SHOULDA JUST LET
ME TALK TO THEM.

220
00:11:12,003 --> 00:11:13,771
NO, NO, HAROLD, I
DON'T THINK YOU'D
HAVE UNDERSTOOD
THEIR ACCENT.

221
00:11:13,838 --> 00:11:17,141
IT'S LIKE A
FOREIGN LANGUAGE.

222
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,010
IT IS A FOREIGN LANGUAGE,
IT'S GERMAN.

223
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:21,079
YOU DON'T SPEAK GERMAN.

224
00:11:21,145 --> 00:11:24,682
WELL, I FIGURED IF YOU SPEAK
ENGLISH LOUD ENOUGH,
EVENTUALLY THEY'LL
FIGURE IT OUT.

225
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:27,952
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT HAPPENED
THERE WAS THE CREATIVE
DIFFERENCES BROUGHT THE
DEAL TO ITS KNEES, HAROLD.

226
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,021
THEY WANTED ME TO
ADD STUFF TO THE SHOW...

227
00:11:30,088 --> 00:11:33,724
ALPENHORNS
AND LEDERHOSEN.

228
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:34,959
THEY ASKED ME
TO "SWISH IT UP."

229
00:11:35,026 --> 00:11:37,728
I DIDN'T LIKE THE
SOUND OF THAT.

230
00:11:37,795 --> 00:11:39,764
YOU SURE THEY DIDN'T
SAY, "SWISS IT UP?"

231
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:41,766
AND LEDERHOSEN ARE
JUST LEATHER PANTS.

232
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,601
MAYBE THEY WANTED IT TO LOOK
MORE LIKE SWITZERLAND,

233
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:46,737
SO IT CAN REFLECT THEIR
AUDIENCE, AND, THAT WAY,
THEY'D BE BE ATTRACTED
TO THE SHOW.

234
00:11:46,804 --> 00:11:51,409
OKAY, SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS
THEY WANT ME TO CHANGE WHO
I AM; WHAT I STAND FOR; AND
WHAT I BELIEVE IN.

235
00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:53,744
YES, BUT FOR MONEY.
ALL RIGHT.

236
00:11:55,646 --> 00:11:58,516
WELL, I'LL JUST GO AND GET
MY LOOFA OUT OF MY SAUNA.

237
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,585
NO, NO, SEE,
THAT'S SWEDEN.

238
00:12:00,651 --> 00:12:01,519
IN MY VOLVO.

239
00:12:01,586 --> 00:12:03,688
THAT'S SWEDEN.

240
00:12:03,754 --> 00:12:04,155
BUCK NAKED.

241
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:06,924
FRANCE.

242
00:12:06,991 --> 00:12:09,227
AH, I GIVE UP.
NOPE, THAT'S ITALY.

243
00:12:09,293 --> 00:12:13,030
(APPLAUSE)

244
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:14,899
HEY! WELCOME.

245
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:16,367
IT'S "THE POSSUM LODGE
WORD GAME."

246
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:19,036
YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY DREAMS OF A
TWO-WEEK VACATION IN HAWAII.

247
00:12:19,103 --> 00:12:23,908
NOW YOU CAN DO MORE THAN
JUST DREAM ABOUT IT.

248
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:28,679
NOW YOU CAN SIT DOWN AND PLAN IT
OUT ON YOUR BRAND NEW
PAD OF PAPER.

249
00:12:28,746 --> 00:12:32,717
(APPLAUSE)

250
00:12:32,783 --> 00:12:35,920
PAD OF PAPER SUPPLIED BY
STAPLES AND SUCH, YOUR
PAD OF PAPER PEOPLE.

251
00:12:35,987 --> 00:12:38,289
AND, NOW, UNCLE RED, TODAY
YOU'LL BE PLAYING WITH
WINSTON ROTHSCHILD

252
00:12:38,356 --> 00:12:41,292
OF ROTHSCHILD'S SEWAGE AND
SEPTIC SUCKING SERVICES.

253
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:46,998
WHERE OUR MOTTO IS, "SERVICE
WITH A SMILE, EVEN ON HOT DAYS."

254
00:12:47,064 --> 00:12:49,834
OKAY.

255
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,704
UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO GET Mr. WINSTON ROTHSCHILD
TO SAY THIS WORD:

256
00:12:58,442 --> 00:13:01,312
ARTIFICIAL.

257
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:02,546
AND GO.

258
00:13:02,613 --> 00:13:04,181
ALL RIGHT, WINSTON,
WHEN SOMETHING
IS FAKE, IT'S...

259
00:13:04,248 --> 00:13:06,717
WRESTLING.

260
00:13:06,784 --> 00:13:08,853
SOME PRODUCTS ARE
ALL-NATURAL,

261
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:11,355
YOU KNOW, FULL,
REAL FLAVOURS.
OTHERS ARE...

262
00:13:11,422 --> 00:13:12,490
TASTY?

263
00:13:12,556 --> 00:13:15,893
NO, NO, PLASTIC, SYNTHETIC...

264
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,763
OH, MY GOOD SUIT.

265
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:22,433
WAIT A SECOND.
WRESTLING IS FAKE?
SHUT UP.

266
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,304
OKAY, WHEN SOMEONE PRETENDS TO
LIKE A PERSON, BUT THEY DON'T
REALLY LIKE THAT PERSON,

267
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:29,173
THEY ARE...
AN EMPLOYEE.

268
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,478
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

269
00:13:34,545 --> 00:13:37,548
OKAY, SOMEBODY WHO
IS ALWAYS INSINCERE IS...

270
00:13:37,615 --> 00:13:39,783
GEARED FOR SUCCESS.

271
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,385
RUNNIN' OUT OF TIME.
RUNNIN' OUT OF TIME.

272
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:43,754
I KNOW, I KNOW. WINSTON, YOU
REMEMBER YOU DATED THAT
CHEERLEADER,

273
00:13:43,821 --> 00:13:46,223
THE ONE WITH THE
GREAT FIGURE?

274
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,391
ARTIFICIAL.

275
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:53,230
(BELL RINGING)

276
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,069
KIND OF A FUN DAY ON
"ADVENTURES WITH BILL" THIS
TIME.

277
00:13:59,136 --> 00:14:01,405
BILL'S GOT THE YO-YO THERE.

278
00:14:01,472 --> 00:14:04,208
BRINGS BACK A LOT OF MEMORIES
BACK IN OUR CHILDHOOD,

279
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:06,277
YOU KNOW... THE YO-YOS.

280
00:14:06,343 --> 00:14:11,215
KIDS, IF YOU SEE ANYBODY IN
THE PARK DOING THIS, KEEP
YOUR DISTANCE, ALL RIGHT?

281
00:14:11,282 --> 00:14:12,583
ANYWAY, BACK WHEN WE
WERE YOUNG --

282
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:16,253
GOT A BIT OF A YO-YO RANCH IN
HIS PANTS, I GUESS.

283
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,355
NO, I'M GOING TO
USE THIS ONE, BILL.

284
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:21,659
YEAH, I REMEMBER THEY USED TO
HAVE COMPETITIONS, DIDN'T THEY?

285
00:14:21,725 --> 00:14:23,627
AND EVERYBODY WOULD COME AROUND
AND TRY THE TRICKS.

286
00:14:23,694 --> 00:14:25,029
(GLASS BREAKING)

287
00:14:25,095 --> 00:14:28,599
NOW, THAT'S A TRICK.

288
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,267
AND HE'S BACK TO
THE DRAWING BOARD,

289
00:14:30,334 --> 00:14:34,204
AND HE'S GOT NOTHING BUT

322
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:45,709
