00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:00,619
BILL IS GOING TO COMBINE
PLUMBING WITH FINGER
EXERCISES

151
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:02,187
AND WE GOT A FEW
MORE WORDS

152
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:04,556
FROM OUR
RESIDENT DING DONG.

153
00:07:09,227 --> 00:07:12,497
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
TEENAGERS ABOUT THE
WAY YOU DRESS.

154
00:07:12,497 --> 00:07:16,401
LET'S MAKE THIS CLEAR
PLAID SHIRTS AND
BAGGY PANTS

155
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:19,638
ARE NOT GRUNGE WEAR,
THEY'RE LODGE WEAR.

156
00:07:19,638 --> 00:07:22,708
WE'VE BEEN DRESSING
LIKE THIS SINCE THE
INVENTION OF CLOTHES

157
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,209
AND WE'LL CONTINUE
TO DRESS LIKE THIS

158
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:27,112
LONG AFTER
YOU'VE ABANDONED IT
FOR SOME NEW FASHION FAD.

159
00:07:27,112 --> 00:07:28,647
AND THIS BRINGS ME
TO MY NEXT POINT,

160
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:31,783
YOU PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE REBELLING AGAINST
OUR GENERATION,

161
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:33,418
NOT COPYING IT.

162
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:36,988
GO GET YOUR OWN LOOK,
TINFOIL UNDERWEAR OR
CHICKEN WIRE

163
00:07:36,988 --> 00:07:39,257
OR LATEX PAINT
OR WHATEVER.

164
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:41,927
IT'S EMBARRASSING WHEN
A 40 YEAR OLD LODGE MEMBER

165
00:07:41,927 --> 00:07:44,429
IS MISTAKEN FOR
A 15 YEAR OLD GIRL,

166
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:46,565
EMBARRASSING
AND DANGEROUS.

167
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:48,500
IT'S ALSO A SAD
COMMENTARY ON WHAT TODAY'S

168
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,504
15 YEAR OLD GIRLS
ARE LOOKING LIKE.

169
00:07:52,504 --> 00:07:54,005
SO I SAY GET OUT OF
THE FLANNEL CLOTHES

170
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:55,507
AND GET INTO SOME
SHARP STUFF NOW

171
00:07:55,507 --> 00:07:56,808
WHILE YOU STILL GOT YOUR
YOUTH AND YOUR LOOKS.

172
00:07:56,808 --> 00:07:58,477
THERE'S NO POINT
IN DRESSING LIKE
A LAUNDRY HAMPER

173
00:07:58,477 --> 00:08:01,546
UNTIL YOU GOT THE FACE
AND THE BODY TO GO WITH IT

174
00:08:02,347 --> 00:08:03,782
I'LL TELL YOU,
OLD MAN SEDGWICK

175
00:08:03,782 --> 00:08:06,418
GETTING 75 BUCKS FOR
THAT MILK STOOL HAS
GOT US ALL THINKING

176
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:08,286
ABOUT HOW WE'VE
UNDERVALUED OUR
POSSESSIONS.

177
00:08:08,286 --> 00:08:10,722
I THINK WE
CAN SELL THEM.

178
00:08:10,722 --> 00:08:13,191
YOU'RE NOT THINKING
OF SELLING THAT, ARE YOU?

179
00:08:13,191 --> 00:08:15,627
WHAT THIS?
NO, NO.

180
00:08:17,162 --> 00:08:20,532
I WOULDN'T PART
WITH THAT, HAROLD.

181
00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:22,133
MIND YOU, IF SOMEBODY
OFFERED ME 300 BUCKS

182
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:24,569
I MIGHT CHANGE
MY MIND.

183
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:26,671
I FIGURE 850
FOR THIS UNIT

184
00:08:26,671 --> 00:08:31,209
AND THIS GUY HAS GOT
TO BE WORTH AT LEAST A
1000, DON'T YOU THINK?

185
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:33,678
COME ON, THIS IS
JUST CRASS COMMERCIALISM.

186
00:08:33,678 --> 00:08:35,647
YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED.

187
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:38,049
AND 5 CENTS WILL
TAKE THIS OFF MY HANDS.

188
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,351
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

189
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:41,653
YOU CAN'T TURN
THIS PLACE INTO AN
OVERPRICED TOURIST TRAP,

190
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:43,955
THAT WILL RUIN ONE OF
THE MAIN ATTRACTIONS
OF POSSUM LAKE.

191
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:46,391
AH, HAROLD, YOU'RE JUST
JEALOUS 'CAUSE YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY WORTHLESS JUNK.

192
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:48,727
ALL YOUR STUFF
IS NEW AND VALUABLE.

193
00:08:48,727 --> 00:08:51,496
I'M TELLING YOU, I'M
GOING TO SELL THIS
FOR 300 BUCKS.

194
00:08:51,496 --> 00:08:54,032
YOU SHOULDN'T BE
SELLING IT AT ALL.

195
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:55,567
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

196
00:08:55,567 --> 00:09:03,141
GIVE ME 200 I'LL
TAKE IT OFF THE MARKET.

197
00:09:03,141 --> 00:09:07,746
I'LL PROBABLY HAVE
A BUSY DAY TODAY.

198
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:09,180
HERE WE ARE FOR
THIS WEEK'S BOATING TIP

199
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,349
WITH GLEN BRACKSTON
OF BRACKSTON'S MARINA.

200
00:09:11,349 --> 00:09:12,584
THANK YOU, RED.

201
00:09:12,584 --> 00:09:14,886
THIS WEEK'S BOATING TIP
WILL BE HOW TO PROPERLY

202
00:09:14,886 --> 00:09:16,855
REMOVE AN OUTBOARD
MOTOR FROM A BOAT.

203
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:21,760
SO HOP IN, RED.
ALRIGHTY.

204
00:09:23,995 --> 00:09:25,497
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

205
00:09:25,497 --> 00:09:28,266
TWO GUYS IN A BOAT,
RED, NO LIFE JACKETS?

206
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:30,001
I DON'T THINK SO.

207
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:33,505
AT LEAST NOT
WITH MY HEALTH.

208
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:35,106
OKAY, NOW, THE FIRST
THING YOU GOT TO DO, RED,

209
00:09:35,106 --> 00:09:41,746
IS YOU GOT TO
TURN OFF THE GAS
AND UNHOOK THE TANK.

210
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:43,648
ALL RIGHT.
THERE WE GO.

211
00:09:43,648 --> 00:09:45,383
OKAY.
NOW, WHAT YOU
GOT TO DO NEXT, RED,

212
00:09:45,383 --> 00:09:47,118
IS YOU GOT TO LOOSEN
OFF THOSE LITTLE
CLAMPS THERE

213
00:09:47,118 --> 00:09:48,520
BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT
THAT BECAUSE I ALREADY

214
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,156
DID THAT IN BETWEEN
DIZZY SPELLS.

215
00:09:51,156 --> 00:09:52,657
YOU MUST BE
EXHAUSTED, GLEN.

216
00:09:52,657 --> 00:09:55,059
OH, YOU GOT TO
PACE YOURSELF, RED.

217
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:57,428
THAT'S WHAT I FOUND
OUT AFTER HAVING
A HEART ATTACK.

218
00:09:57,428 --> 00:09:58,930
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

219
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:03,668
OKAY.
SO NOW HAUL HER
UP OUT OF THERE, RED.

220
00:10:03,668 --> 00:10:05,270
YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO HELP ME?

221
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,471
WITH MY BACK?

222
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:08,907
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU USE.

223
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:11,976
QUIT YOUR WHINING, RED,
ONE GUY CAN LIFT A
MOTOR THAT SIZE.

224
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:14,279
WELL WHY DOES IT
HAVE TO BE THIS GUY?

225
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:18,683
BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE.
OH FOR PETE SAKES.

226
00:10:18,683 --> 00:10:20,051
OKAY.
NOW JUST BE CAREFUL.

227
00:10:20,051 --> 00:10:23,821
I TOLD YOU.

228
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:25,189
I WAS WATCHING
FOR THAT, RED.

229
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:26,858
SEE THERE'S A
SAFETY CHAIN ON THERE.

230
00:10:26,858 --> 00:10:28,192
THAT'S SO IT DOESN'T
FALL IN THE WATER.

231
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:29,561
YOU GOT TO
WATCH THAT, RED.

232
00:10:29,561 --> 00:10:31,429
THAT'S IT.
UNHOOK IT.
OKAY.

233
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:33,231
OKAY, NOW,
JUST LIFT HER UP.

234
00:10:33,231 --> 00:10:35,967
BE CAREFUL.
BE CAREFUL, RED.

235
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:41,072
DON'T SCUFF HER.
DON'T SCUFF IT UP.

236
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:42,240
OKAY.
THAT'S GOOD.

237
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,309
QUIT YOUR WHINING, RED.

238
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:45,677
EXERCISE IS A GOOD
THING, NOT A BAD THING.

239
00:10:45,677 --> 00:10:47,845
YOU STAND STILL I'LL
DROP THIS RIGHT
ON YOUR FOOT.

240
00:10:47,845 --> 00:10:49,614
NO.
NO THANKS.

241
00:10:49,614 --> 00:10:53,284
I JUST -- WHAT WE GOT
TO DO, WE GOT TO GET
IT UP TO MY PICK-UP.

242
00:10:53,284 --> 00:10:54,485
WHAT?

243
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:57,555
OH, YEAH, IT'S MY
CONTRIBUTION TO
THE BIG SALE.

244
00:10:57,555 --> 00:10:58,790
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

245
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,491
GEEZ I HOPE YOU GET
LOTS OF PEOPLE
UP HERE, TOO.

246
00:11:00,491 --> 00:11:02,460
LOTS OF PEOPLE
MEAN LOTS OF MONEY.

247
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,829
WELL HOW ARE WE
GOING TO GET LOTS
OF PEOPLE UP HERE?

248
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:07,198
ADVERTISE,
RED, FLYERS.

249
00:11:07,198 --> 00:11:08,866
AND ONCE YOU
GET THEM UP HERE,

250
00:11:08,866 --> 00:11:11,903
YOU GOT TO
TREAT THEM
RIGHT, THAT'S THE KEY.

251
00:11:11,903 --> 00:11:13,471
TREAT THEM RIGHT, RED.

252
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:14,839
SO GET GOING.
HURRY UP.

253
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:16,808
COME ON.

254
00:11:16,808 --> 00:11:17,975
GET IT UP TO
THE PICK-UP.

255
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:19,343
THAT'S IT.
COME ON.

256
00:11:19,343 --> 00:11:20,611
ALL RIGHT.

257
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:21,946
IT'S NOT
THAT HEAVY, RED.

258
00:11:21,946 --> 00:11:31,355
IT'S MAIL CALL.

259
00:11:31,355 --> 00:11:33,257
GOT A LETTER
HERE FROM KEVIN

260
00:11:33,257 --> 00:11:34,759
FROM COURTLAND, IDAHO,

261
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:37,495
AND KEVIN IS WRITING
FROM A CORRECTIONAL
FACILITY.

262
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:39,597
OH, COOL.
OKAY.

263
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:42,099
AND HE SAYS: "I HAVE HAD
TO CONVERT A LOT OF PEOPLE

264
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:43,701
"SO THAT I COULD
WATCH YOUR SHOW

265
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:47,138
"AND NOT AN EASY FEAT
FOR A FRIDAY NIGHT."

266
00:11:47,138 --> 00:11:49,707
WELL, KEVIN, WE APPRECIATE
YOUR ENTHUSIASM

267
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:52,210
BUT LET ME REMIND YOU
THAT IT'S VERY DANGEROUS

268
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,811
TO BE FORCING
CONVICTED CRIMINALS

269
00:11:53,811 --> 00:11:55,847
TO BE WATCHING OUR
PROGRAM, ALL RIGHT?

270
00:11:55,847 --> 00:11:57,248
UNCLE RED,
THESE AREN'T ANIMALS.

271
00:11:57,248 --> 00:11:58,816
THESE ARE JUST PEOPLE
WHO HAVE MADE MISTAKES

272
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:00,618
AND THEY'RE PAYING
THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY.

273
00:12:00,618 --> 00:12:03,387
YES, I KNOW THAT, HAROLD,
AND WE DON'T WANT TO
INTERFERE WITH THAT

274
00:12:03,387 --> 00:12:05,556
BY PUTTING THESE GUYS
INTO A SITUATION
WHERE VIOLENCE

275
00:12:05,556 --> 00:12:09,193
BECOMES THE
ONLY ALTERNATIVE.

276
00:12:10,027 --> 00:12:11,495
YOU READ THE LETTER.

277
00:12:11,495 --> 00:12:13,264
I MEAN, OUR OTHER VIEWERS
WHEN THE SHOW COMES ON
THEY HAVE CHOICES.

278
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:14,799
THEY CAN TURN IT OFF,
THEY CAN SWITCH THE CHANNEL,

279
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,135
THEY CAN THROW THEIR
TELEVISION SET INTO A
RAVINE IF THEY CARE TO.

280
00:12:18,135 --> 00:12:19,570
THESE GUYS ARE
LOCKED IN A ROOM

281
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,840
WITH A TV SET AND AN ARMED
SECURITY GUARD, HAROLD.

282
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,108
THINK ABOUT
THIS SHOW, EH?

283
00:12:24,108 --> 00:12:26,177
WE'RE ASKING FOR
TROUBLE, DON'T YOU THINK?

284
00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:27,545
YEAH.
BUT I MEAN IF
THEY LIKE THE SHOW

285
00:12:27,545 --> 00:12:29,046
THEY COULD CONTINUE
WATCHING IT, RIGHT?

286
00:12:29,046 --> 00:12:33,017
WELL, IF THEY ADMIT
THAT IT'S GOING TO
DELAY THEIR PAROLE.

287
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:36,621
Red Green:
TIME TO INTERFERE
WITH THE LAWS OF NATURE.

288
00:12:36,621 --> 00:12:38,489
TIME FOR
ADVENTURES WITH BILL.

289
00:12:38,489 --> 00:12:40,358
YOU OKAY THERE, BILL?

290
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:41,892
THAT'S THE FIRST ONE.

291
00:12:41,892 --> 00:12:44,962
THAT WOULD BE MOMENTUM
AND INERTIA EQUAL AN
OPPOSITE REACTION.

292
00:12:44,962 --> 00:12:46,364
NOW, ONE OF THE LAWS
OF NATURE IS THAT

293
00:12:46,364 --> 00:12:47,832
WATER WILL NOT GO UPHILL

294
00:12:47,832 --> 00:12:49,367
AND BILL WANTS TO
WORK AGAINST THAT USING

295
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:50,968
SOME SORT OF AN
ELECTRICAL PUMP THERE

296
00:12:50,968 --> 00:12:52,503
AND A PRESSURE TANK.

297
00:12:52,503 --> 00:12:54,038
AND THIS IS THE INLET HOSE.

298
00:12:54,038 --> 00:12:55,573
HE HAS ME HOOK THAT UP
THERE AND HE'S GOT TO TAKE

299
00:12:55,573 --> 00:12:57,608
THE OTHER END
DOWN TO THE LAKE.

300
00:12:57,608 --> 00:12:59,744
NOW APPARENTLY HERE IF
THE HOSE RUNS OVER A
TREE OR OVER A RIDGE

301
00:12:59,744 --> 00:13:01,345
OR SOMETHING, THE WATER
DOESN'T RUN PROPERLY,

302
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:02,880
SO YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP
HER SMOOTH AND I GUESS

303
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,216
GET THE ROCKS
OUT OF THE WAY.

304
00:13:05,216 --> 00:13:08,419
MAYBE BE A
LITTLE MORE CAREFUL OF
WHERE YOU PUT THE ROCKS.

305
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:10,654
I LET GO OF THE HOSE.

306
00:13:10,654 --> 00:13:13,357
AND I HELP BILL ALL
THE WAY DOWN TO THE LAKE.

307
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:16,227
THERE YOU GO.

308
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:17,695
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
IN THE LAKE SOON, BILL.

309
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,930
THERE YOU GO.
YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK.

310
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,499
THAT WORKED OUT REAL WELL.

311
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:23,567
THE OTHER END IS SUPPOSED
TO BE STILL HOOKED UP
TO THE PUMP.

312
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:25,903
SO WE GO BACK, WE REDO
THAT, AND I DON'T USE
ANY CLAMPS OR ANYTHING,

313
00:13:25,903 --> 00:13:27,638
I USE THE HANDYMAN SECRET
WEAPON ON THAT,

314
00:13:27,638 --> 00:13:29,106
MUCH TIGHTER
AND WATERPROOF.

315
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:30,307
AND BILL IS
GOING TO TIE THE FOOT
VALVE ON TO A BIG --

316
00:13:30,307 --> 00:13:31,375
BILL, YOU'VE TIED
IT TO YOUR WRIST.

317
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,910
THAT'S GOING TO KEEP
IT ON THE BOTTOM.

318
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:39,483
SO BILL IS GOING TO BE
ON THE BOTTOM FOR
A FEW MINUTES.

319
00:13:39,483 --> 00:13:40,818
SO THERE WE GO
AND NOW WE'RE --

320
00:13:40,818 --> 00:13:42,553
OH.
OH.

321
00:13:42,553 --> 00:13:44,688
TAKE A LITTLE BREAK
THERE FROM MY WORK.

322
00:13:44,688 --> 00:13:46,991
AND WE'RE ALL SET TO
KIND OF PLUG HER IN NOW

323
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:49,193
BECAUSE WE GOT THE
OUTSIDE OF --

324
00:13:49,193 --> 00:13:50,694
I JUST GOT TO --
ONCE I FINISH MY BREAK

325
00:13:50,694 --> 00:13:52,129
WE'LL GET RIGHT
BACK TO WORK.

326
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:53,898
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU BILL.

327
00:13:53,898 --> 00:13:55,566
CHANGE IS AS GOOD
AS THE REST I GUESS.

328
00:13:55,566 --> 00:13:56,934
NOW WE'RE GOING TO --

329
00:13:56,934 --> 00:13:58,269
WHEN WE PLUG THIS
THING IN, THE PUMP
WILL START

330
00:13:58,269 --> 00:13:59,837
AND THE WATER WILL
COME UP FROM THE LAKE,

331
00:13:59,837 --> 00:14:02,339
GO THROUGH THE
HOSE AND UP INTO THAT
BIG PRESSURE TANK THERE

332
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:05,409
AND IT GOES OUT
OF THE PRESSURE TANK
INTO THE GARDEN HOSE.

333
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:07,511
BILL IS GOING TO USE
THIS TO WATER THE
PLANTS AND SO ON

334
00:14:07,511 --> 00:14:10,080
THAT WE MAY HAVE AT
SOME POINT AROUND
THE LODGE.

335
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,384
YEAH, BILL, OKAY,
WE UNDERSTAND IT COMES
OUT THE END OF THE HOSE.

336
00:14:13,384 --> 00:14:14,919
OH MAN.

337
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:17,221
ALL RIGHT,
WE'RE ALL SET TO GO.
I JUST PLUG HER IN.

338
00:14:17,221 --> 00:14:19,123
DIDN'T BOTHER WITH
A SWITCH OR ANYTHING.

339
00:14:19,123 --> 00:14:21,292
WE'RE NOT MADE OF MONEY.

340
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:23,294
I WOULDN'T LOOK DOWN THERE
IF I WERE YOU, BILL.

341
00:14:23,294 --> 00:14:25,095
WATER IS GOING TO COME
OUT THERE I THINK.

342
00:14:25,095 --> 00:14:26,997
OH NO.
OH NO.

343
00:14:26,997 --> 00:14:28,365
NO, I'M WRONG ABOUT THAT.

344
00:14:28,365 --> 00:14:30,501
THERE'S A BIT OF HOLE
IN THE PRESSURE
TANK I GUESS.

345
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:32,569
BILL, I WOULDN'T
GO THERE, BILL.

346
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:34,071
BILL.

347
00:14:34,071 --> 00:14:38,175
OH, OH, OH, WHAT
WAS I THINKING.
BY GOLLY.

348
00:14:38,175 --> 00:14:40,177
OH.

349
00:14:40,177 --> 00:14:43,380
SO NOW WE CHANGE
THE PLAN TOTALLY

350
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,750
AND TRY TO WORK WITH NATURE
RATHER THAN AGAINST IT.

351
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,585
WE'RE NOT GOING TO USE
ELECTRICITY OR A PUMP,

352
00:14:48,585 --> 00:14:50,254
WE'RE GOING TO GET
WATER COMING OUT
THE HOSE

353
00:14:50,254 --> 00:14:54,191
USING ONE OF THE ORIGINAL
FORCES OF POWER, GRAVITY.

354
00:14:54,191 --> 00:14:56,393
WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT RUNNING NO
ELECTRICITY,

355
00:14:56,393 --> 00:14:59,797
WE GOT TO WORRY ABOUT
RUNNING OUT OF GAS

356
00:14:59,797 --> 00:15:01,632
Red Green:
STAY TUNED.

357
00:15:01,632 --> 00:15:03,734
MIKE IS GOING TO SHOW
US A NEW USE FOR CHAINS

358
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:07,371
AND DALTON DONATES A BUNCH
OF STUFF THAT I WOULD
CALL PRICELESS.

359
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:10,441
WELL, WE'RE MOVING
AHEAD WITH THE GREAT

360
00:15:10,441 --> 00:15:12,076
POSSUM LAKE SALE
OF COLLECTIBLES

361
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:14,645
AND OTHER STUFF THE
GARBAGE MEN WOULDN'T TAKE.

362
00:15:14,645 --> 00:15:16,013
YOU KNOW, YOU NEVER
REALLY KNOW PEOPLE

363
00:15:16,013 --> 00:15:17,881
UNTIL YOU SEE WHAT THEY'RE
WILLING TO SELL AND
FOR HOW MUCH.

364
00:15:17,881 --> 00:15:21,251
AND TO WHOM.

365
00:15:21,251 --> 00:15:23,187
PEOPLE FROM
THE CITY, HAROLD,
PEOPLE WITH MONEY,

366
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:25,155
PEOPLE WHO SEE VALUE IN
THE THINGS WE HAVE
UP HERE.

367
00:15:25,155 --> 00:15:27,024
THERE'S BASICALLY
NOTHING BUT JUNK UP HERE.

368
00:15:27,024 --> 00:15:29,726
ONE MAN'S JUNK
IS ANOTHER MAN'S
ANTIQUE, HAROLD.

369
00:15:29,726 --> 00:15:32,930
AND IF SOMEONE THINKS
RUST AND DUST TURNS
TRASH INTO CASH,

370
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,299
WHO AM I TO ARGUE?

371
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:37,734
THESE PEOPLE ARE A
LOT SMARTER THAN WE ARE.

372
00:15:37,734 --> 00:15:40,003
SO YOU MEAN THEY HAVE
A LOT MORE MONEY
THAN YOU DO.

373
00:15:40,003 --> 00:15:43,640
WELL, THAT'S ABOUT
TO CHANGE, HAROLD.

374
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,643
WE SENT OUT 10,000
OF THESE INVITATIONS

375
00:15:46,643 --> 00:15:48,946
AND WE'RE ABOUT TO HAVE
THE BIGGEST AUCTION

376
00:15:48,946 --> 00:15:50,214
POSSUM LAKE
HAS EVER SEEN.

377
00:15:50,214 --> 00:15:52,883
10,000 PEOPLE
ARE COMING HERE?

378
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:55,252
ALL LOADED WITH
DISPOSABLE INCOME, HAROLD,

379
00:15:55,252 --> 00:15:58,088
JUST LOOKING FOR THAT
LITTLE KNICKKNACK

380
00:15:58,088 --> 00:16:01,358
THAT WE PROBABLY GOT
PROPPING OPEN THE
UTHOUSE DOOR.

381
00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:02,960
WITH 10,000
PEOPLE COMING HERE,

382
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,729
THE DOOR IS GOING
TO BE RIGHT OFF
THE OUTHOUSE.

383
00:16:05,729 --> 00:16:07,297
IT WILL BE A
ONE HOUR EVENT,

384
00:16:07,297 --> 00:16:09,466
GET THEM IN,
GET THE MONEY,
GET THEM OUT.

385
00:16:09,466 --> 00:16:11,935
THE LOVE OF MONEY IS
THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL.

386
00:16:11,935 --> 00:16:16,039
THE LACK OF MONEY IS
THE ROOT OF MOST PROBLEMS.

387
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:18,475
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK
I WOULD GET FOR MY
BABY HUEY BED?

388
00:16:18,475 --> 00:16:20,677
25 BUCKS.

389
00:16:20,677 --> 00:16:21,979
REALLY?

390
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:25,849
Red: 50 IF THEY
DON'T KNOW IT'S YOURS.

391
00:16:25,849 --> 00:16:28,085
WE'RE OUT HERE BY THE
MAIN HIGHWAY

392
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:29,720
AT HUMPHREY'S
EVERYTHING STORE

393
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,388
TO TALK TO THE MAN
WHO KNOWS EVERYTHING

394
00:16:31,388 --> 00:16:37,527
THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT
AUCTIONS, DALTON HUMPHRIES.

395
00:16:37,527 --> 00:16:39,062
AND DALTON HAS KINDLY
AGREED TO DONATE
FOR THE AUCTION

396
00:16:39,062 --> 00:16:41,498
A WHOLE BUSLOAD FULL
OF HIS FINEST WARES.

397
00:16:41,498 --> 00:16:43,033
OH, AND A BUS.
TAKE THAT TOO.

398
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:44,701
TAKE IT ALL.
IT'S YOURS.

399
00:16:44,701 --> 00:16:46,069
OH MY GOSH.

400
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:47,871
WELL, THIS WILL HAVE TO
BE OUR FEATURED ITEM
AT THE AUCTION.

401
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,407
IT WAS GOING TO BE
MOOSE THOMPSON'S BOX
SPRING AND MATTRESS,

402
00:16:50,407 --> 00:16:51,708
BUT NOT NOW.

403
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,244
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I HATE TO GIVE AWAY
ANYTHING FOR FREE.

404
00:16:54,244 --> 00:16:59,216
AND THIS WHOLE BUS
IS JUST CHALK A BLOCK
FULL OF VALUABLE ITEMS.

405
00:16:59,216 --> 00:17:01,518
YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT BE
INTERESTED IN BIDDING
ON IT YOURSELF, RED.

406
00:17:01,518 --> 00:17:03,086
OH, NO THANK
YOU, DALTON,

407
00:17:03,086 --> 00:17:06,523
I'M GOING TO BE SITTING
AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM
COUNTING THE MONEY.

408
00:17:06,523 --> 00:17:09,659
WELL, YOU KNOW THAT
OLD BARBER CHAIR THAT
I HAD THAT YOU LIKED

409
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:11,228
AND YOU WANTED TO PUT
IT ON THE ROOF OF
YOUR VAN

410
00:17:11,228 --> 00:17:13,396
BECAUSE YOU
WANTED A FLYING BRIDGE.

411
00:17:13,396 --> 00:17:14,698
IS THAT IN THERE?

412
00:17:14,698 --> 00:17:16,166
OH, NO, NO, BUT THERE'S
A WHOLE BOX OF CRANKS

413
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,934
THAT GO ON THE SIDE
HANDLE ARE IN THERE.

414
00:17:17,934 --> 00:17:20,704
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE --
HOLY SMOKE.
WHAT?

415
00:17:20,704 --> 00:17:25,675
WELL, SEE THERE'S A
WHOLE BOX FULL OF
MUST BE

BRAND NEW PAINT CAN LIDS

TO HOLD ON TO

417
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:31,147
'CAUSE I THOUGHT I MIGHT
NEED SOME TIME --.

418
00:17:31,147 --> 00:17:34,384
YOU WANT TO
TAKE THEM BACK?

419
00:17:34,384 --> 00:17:36,820
WOULD YOU
THINK LESS OF ME?
NO.

420
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:41,157
I DON'T THINK THAT
WOULD BE POSSIBLE.

421
00:17:41,157 --> 00:17:42,859
YOU KNOW, I HOPE I'M
DOING THE RIGHT THING, RED,

422
00:17:42,859 --> 00:17:45,295
GIVING AWAY ALL
THESE CHERISHED ITEMS.

423
00:17:45,295 --> 00:17:46,696
WELL, IF YOU'RE
WORRIED ABOUT IT, DALTON,

424
00:17:46,696 --> 00:17:48,865
WHY DON'T YOU DO WHAT
THEY DO AT THE BIG
FANCY AUCTIONS?

425
00:17:48,865 --> 00:17:50,867
PUT A RESERVE
BID IN ON THIS.

WHAT I THINK IT'S WORTH.

427
00:17:52,702 --> 00:17:55,138
THE WHOLE BUSLOAD
COMES BACK TO YOU.
THERE YOU GO.

428
00:17:55,138 --> 00:17:57,040
YOU JUST TELL ME THE
MINIMUM AMOUNT OF MONEY

429
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,308
YOU WOULD BE
WILLING TO TAKE

430
00:17:58,308 --> 00:18:02,579
TO GET ALL THIS
STUFF OFF YOUR HANDS.

431
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:07,450
$5.00.

432
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,319
WELL, WE CAN TRY IT.

433
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:10,987
THIS SATURDAY THE POSSUM
LAKE NUDIST CLUB

434
00:18:10,987 --> 00:18:12,555
IS HOLDING ITS
DINNER/DANCE.

435
00:18:12,555 --> 00:18:14,291
DRESS IS BLACK TIE ONLY.

436
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,294
MUSIC -- OH, MUSIC IS
BY BUCKY AND THE
SKIN TONES.

437
00:18:17,294 --> 00:18:20,096
DUE TO MISHAP LAST YEAR,
WE WILL NOT BE HAVING
THE LIMBO DANCE

438
00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:22,932
OR SERVING FONDUE,

439
00:18:22,932 --> 00:18:27,103
AND THE BARBECUE GRILLS
WILL BE AT CHEST HEIGHT.

440
00:18:27,103 --> 00:18:30,674
AS YOU KNOW, WE'RE WELL
INTO OUR DREAM HOME
RENOVATION PROJECT

441
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:33,009
AND NOW IT'S TIME
TO START LOOKING
AT FURNITURE.

442
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:35,745
AND THAT'S WHERE
MIKE HERE COMES IN.

443
00:18:35,745 --> 00:18:37,981
WELL, YOU KNOW EVERYBODY
LIKES ANTIQUES,
MR. GREEN,

444
00:18:37,981 --> 00:18:39,849
RIGHT, BUT TO FILL A
HOUSE FULL OF ANTIQUES,

445
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:42,252
I MEAN YOU NEED A
MAJOR BANK ROLL, RIGHT?
YEAH.

446
00:18:42,252 --> 00:18:43,953
UNLESS YOU KNOW WHERE
TO GET STUFF CHEAP.

447
00:18:43,953 --> 00:18:46,056
I DON'T HANG OUT WITH
THOSE GUYS ANYMORE,
YOU KNOW?

448
00:18:46,056 --> 00:18:48,525
OH NO.

449
00:18:48,525 --> 00:18:53,263
IT'S A CONDITION
OF MY PAROLE.

450
00:18:53,263 --> 00:18:58,234
SO TODAY WE'RE GOING
TO BE DISTRESSING
FURNITURE.

451
00:18:58,234 --> 00:18:59,702
ALL RIGHT, DISTRESSING
FURNITURE,

452
00:18:59,702 --> 00:19:02,071
THIS IS WHERE YOU REFINISH
ANTIQUES USING WHAT IS IT?

453
00:19:02,071 --> 00:19:05,275
CHAINS, ROCKS,
HAMMERS, YOU KNOW,

454
00:19:05,275 --> 00:19:09,446
ABUSING THIS FURNITURE
IS GOING TO MAKE IT LOOK
OLDER AND MORE VALUABLE.

455
00:19:09,446 --> 00:19:14,651
BOY, FURNITURE UP HERE
AT THE LODGE MUST BE
WORTH A FORTUNE.

456
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:17,053
NOW, YOU TAKE
THIS TABLE HERE.

457
00:19:17,053 --> 00:19:19,122
YOU SEE IF IT WAS NEW,
IT WOULD PROBABLY
COST YOU ABOUT

458
00:19:19,122 --> 00:19:20,857
A HUNDRED
BUCKS, RIGHT?

459
00:19:20,857 --> 00:19:23,526
THIS LOOKS LIKE YOUR
PRISON LUNCH TABLE HERE.

460
00:19:23,526 --> 00:19:25,628
WELL, YES,
IT IS ACTUALLY.

461
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:28,631
BUT, YOU SEE, IT'S
ALREADY GOT CHARACTER
IN IT ALREADY, YOU SEE?

462
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:30,133
IT'S PROBABLY
BECAUSE OF THAT.

463
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:31,734
YOU SEE YOU GOT THE
SCUFF MARKS ON THE LEGS

464

AND YOU GOT
YOUR COFFEE
RINGS HERE AND THERE.

THERE'S A NICE
COFFEE RING, THERE.

466
00:19:35,672 --> 00:19:37,340
SO LIKE PEOPLE
ARE GOING TO BE
WONDERING, YOU KNOW,

467
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,877
IT MAKES PEOPLE WONDER
WHO PUT THOSE MARKS
ON THERE, RIGHT?

468
00:19:40,877 --> 00:19:43,479
WELL I'M
GUESSING YOU DID.

469
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:46,082
POSSIBLY.

470
00:19:46,082 --> 00:19:49,419
BUT YOU SEE NOW WITH
THE CHARACTER AND
AGE AND BEAUTY

471
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:52,488
THAT IT'S ALREADY
AMASSED, IT'S PROBABLY
WORTH ABOUT 150 BUCKS

472
00:19:52,488 --> 00:19:54,123
AS IS RIGHT NOW.

473
00:19:54,123 --> 00:19:57,860
WOW, YOU KNOW, AND
I'LL BET THERE'S SOME
GUM UNDERNEATH THERE, TOO.

474
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,631
OH YEAH, ABOUT THE
SIZE OF A BEEHIVE
DOWN THERE.

475
00:20:01,631 --> 00:20:04,500
BOY, YOU SURE GOT AN
EYE FOR ANTIQUES,
MR. GREEN.

476
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,202
NOW WE'RE GOING TO
PUT SOME MORE HISTORY

477
00:20:06,202 --> 00:20:11,274
AND AGE INTO IT TO MAKE
IT REALLY WORTH SOMETHING.

478
00:20:11,274 --> 00:20:14,377

OKAY.

479

WORTH ABOUT 250 NOW,
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

BOY, IF HE IMPROVES
IT MUCH MORE,

486

TO AFFORD THE INSURANCE.

IT LOOKED TO BE
LESS THAN 10,000.

IT WAS HALF OF 10,000.

HE WAS HOPING TO GET

511
00:21:48,604 --> 00:21:52,375
HE GOT A DIME FROM
THE SKEET SHOOTING CLUB.

SOLD WELL, THOUGH,

514
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,515
WELL, THE BID
WAS 6 BUCKS, HAROLD,

BUT THE GUY WITHDREW
IT WHEN HE SAW

516
00:22:00,716 --> 00:22:03,185
THERE WAS A SCRATCH
ON THE BACK BUMPER.

517
