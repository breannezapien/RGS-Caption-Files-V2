00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:10,310
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW!"

2
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:13,146
AND NOW PLEASE HELP WELCOME
THE MAN THAT KNOWS ALL
ABOUT NUTS AND BOLTS

3
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,581
BECAUSE HE'S A BIT
OF EACH HIMSELF,

4
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:15,982
YOUR HOST,
YOUR HERO,
MY UNCLE,

5
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,751
RED GRE-E-E-N!

7
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:32,866
AND THIS HERE IS HAROLD,

8
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:35,502
MY PRODUCER AND
DIRECTOR AND NEPHEW.

9
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,537
OH BOY.

10
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:44,344
I LIKE TO CUT, WIPE, DOLLY
AND ZOOM SQUEEZE FRAME.

11
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,580
LET'S HOPE HE'S TALKING ABOUT
TELEVISION TERMS THERE.

12
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,849
KIND OF A QUIET WEEK UP
AT THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

13
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,952
NO, NO WAY, IT WASN'T.
THERE'S LOTS TO TALK
ABOUT, LIKE, CRIME.

14
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:55,788
AND PLENTY OF IT TOO.

15
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,491
WE GOT THIEVES
AMONG US, UNCLE RED,

16
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,393
AND BULLIES.

17
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,295
OH, HAROLD, SOMEBODY
STEAL YOUR LUNCH AGAIN?

18
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:03,897
YES.

19
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:06,165
AND I KNOW
WHO IT WAS TOO.
OH, I DO, I DO.

20
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,568
IT'S BUSTER HATFIELD'S
KID. WHAT A PUNK.

21
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:09,836
BUSTER HATFIELD'S KID?

22
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:10,837
YOU MEAN SUSIE?

23
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,605
YEAH, HER.
SHE'S A PUNK.

24
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,641
NOT FAIR AT ALL.

25
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:16,709
HAROLD, YOU DON'T
EVEN KNOW IT'S HER.

26
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:18,945
JUST BECAUSE YOUR LUNCH IS
MISSING OUT OF YOUR LOCKER
DOESN'T MEAN SUSIE TOOK IT.

27
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,079
WELL, I KNOW
IT WAS HER.

28
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,215
I'M WALKING THROUGH THE
CAFETERIA, RIGHT...

29
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,318
AND JUST WALKING ALONG,
AND I'M LOOKING FOR...
YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY TO
LET ME SIT WITH THEM.

30
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:26,819
AND, ALL OF A SUDDEN --
I GOT MY LUNCH HANGING
IN MY HANDS,

31
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:29,188
AND SHE WALKS RIGHT UP AND
GRABS IT AND KEEPS ON WALKING.

32
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,658
WHAT CAN YOU DO?
YOU CAN'T HIT HER.

33
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:34,794
NO, NO, NO, NO, HAROLD,
YOU DON'T EVER HIT ANYONE

34
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:37,630
BECAUSE THEY CAN HIT YOU
BACK, AND YOU'D FOLD UP
LIKE A DECK CHAIR.

35
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,299
I KNOW THAT.

36
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,201
PERSON'S GOT TO DO
SOMETHING, YOU KNOW?

37
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,505
'CAUSE IT'S EACH INDIVIDUAL'S
RESPONSIBILITY TO STOP CRIME.

38
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:48,441
THAT'S WHY I'M GOING
TO TELL THE PRINCIPAL.

39
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:52,412
OH, YEAH, GET AN ALL-POINTS
BULLETIN GOING THERE.

40
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:53,780
WHAT WAS IN THE
LUNCH ANYWAY?

41
00:01:53,846 --> 00:01:57,050
THREE SARDINE SANDWICHES
AND A POMEGRANATE.

42
00:01:57,116 --> 00:02:01,821
WELL, YOU BETTER TELL
THE COPS TO TREAT HER
AS ARMED AND DANGEROUS.

43
00:02:02,955 --> 00:02:17,170
[QUIRKY UPBEAT MUSIC]

44
00:02:17,236 --> 00:02:20,139
GOT KIND OF AN APOCALYPTIC
SHOW FOR YOU THIS WEEK.

45
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:22,942
GOT A LITTLE BIT OF FIRE THERE.

46
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,411
THAT WOULD BE PESTILENCE,
I WOULD THINK.

47
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,714
AND WE HAVE AN ASSAULT WITH
A FRIENDLY WEAPON,

48
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:30,850
SO STAY TUNED.

49
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,524
WHERE EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERYBODY.

50
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:42,428
YOU DON'T GET A LOT OF ADULTERY
WHEN EVERYBODY IS YOUR COUSIN.

51
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,300
THERE'S NO
JUSTICE.
WHAT?

52
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:48,267
NO JUSTICE.

53
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,869
THE SYSTEM IS COMPLETELY
BREAKING DOWN.

54
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:53,739
THERE'S NO PROTECTION
OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS.

55
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:56,142
CRIME IS RUNNING RAMPANT.

56
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,678
O-O-W!

57
00:02:58,744 --> 00:03:00,146
OKAY, YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS?

58
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,748
I GO RIGHT INTO THE
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE TO
REPORT MY LUNCH THEFT.

59
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:06,652
WHILE I'M IN THERE, SOMEONE
STEALS MY RUNNING SHOES.

60
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,054
IT'S PROBABLY SUSIE.

61
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,790
YOU NEED RUNNING SHOES
WHEN THE SARDINES KICK IN.

62
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:14,193
UNCLE RED, YOU MOCK THIS, BUT
THIS IS JUST THE TIP OF THE
ICEBERG, I'M TELLING YOU.

63
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,628
YOU KNOW WHAT? IN THE BIG
CITIES, RIGHT --

64
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,163
IN THE BIG CITIES, RIGHT --
THE BIG CITIES, RIGHT,

65
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:19,131
THEY'VE GOT, LIKE,
MURDERS EVERY TIME,

66
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,100
AND THEN THERE'S,
LIKE, FIRES AND ARSON

67
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:23,302
AND GANG WARS GOING
ON ALL OVER THE PLACE.

68
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,137
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE IT'S HERE IN
POSSUM LAKE.

69
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:27,840
YEAH, YEAH.

70
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:30,109
IT'S A PRESSURE COOKER OUT
THERE, I'M TELLING YOU,

71
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,012
AND WHEN IT BLOWS... BOOM!

72
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,548
BEANS EVERYWHERE.

73
00:03:35,614 --> 00:03:38,451
I WILL NOT STAND FOR IT,
UNCLE RED, I WILL NOT.

74
00:03:38,517 --> 00:03:41,287
YOU KNOW, HAROLD,
YOU SHOULD JUST KIND
OF RELAX A LITTLE BIT.

75
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,823
THIS MIGHT JUST KIND OF BE
A HORMONE BUILD-UP

76
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:46,926
THAT TEENAGERS GET
WHEN THEY DON'T DATE.

77
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:48,260
YEAH?

78
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:51,130
BOY, YOU'VE GOT
A GOOD MEMORY.

79
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:01,741
YOU KNOW, THE SAD THING IS
YOUR GENERATION DOESN'T
HAVE A WAR

80
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:06,112
WHERE THEY CAN GO OFF TO A
FOREIGN COUNTRY AND BLOW
OFF SOME STEAM.

81
00:04:06,178 --> 00:04:09,381
I'M TELLING YOU --
I AM TELLING YOU,
IT STARTS WITH STEALING
LUNCHES AND STEALING SHOES,

82
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:11,817
AND THEN THERE'S CAR STEALING
AND THE RUNNING NUMBERS.

83
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,285
WELL, WE'RE NOT GOING
TO TAKE IT ANYMORE.

84
00:04:13,352 --> 00:04:16,522
WE'RE STARTING A
NEIGHBOURHOOD WATCH.

85
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,957
YEAH -- YEAH --
YEAH -- YEAH.

86
00:04:18,023 --> 00:04:19,291
AND WE'RE SETTING UP
A SNITCH LINE,

87
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,594
SO YOU CAN PHONE IN,
AND YOU CAN SNITCH
ON PEOPLE.

88
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,329
YUP, WE'RE GOING TO MARCH
UP AND DOWN THE STREETS,

89
00:04:23,395 --> 00:04:26,432
MAKING SURE THAT LAW AND ORDER
IS PRESERVED IN OUR COMMUNITY.

90
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:27,867
WHO IS THIS "WE"?
THE "WE."

91
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:28,934
WHO IS "WE"?

92
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:30,569
ME AND TOMMY DOUGAL.

93
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:32,905
YEAH, YOU KNOW TOMMY.
HE'S GOT THE BAD SKIN
AND THE MOTOR SCOOTER.

94
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:33,873

THE THREE OF US.
THERE'S SAFETY
IN NUMBERS.

97
00:04:38,477 --> 00:04:41,580
THOSE ARE PRETTY
ODD NUMBERS.

105
00:05:17,082 --> 00:05:19,485

ALL RIGHT. DALTON, THIS IS

OKAY, OKAY, YOUR WIFE

114
00:05:38,737 --> 00:05:41,140
WALLET.

115
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:44,143

00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:48,547
LET'S GO ANOTHER WAY.

118
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,416
WHEN SOMEBODY GETS
ANGRY WITH SOMEBODY,

119
00:05:50,482 --> 00:05:51,550
THEY WILL HIT HIM
WITH A FIRM...

120
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,685
PATERNITY SUIT.

121
00:05:53,752 --> 00:05:56,088

RIGHT. AND WHY DO I
HAVE A HAMMER INJURY?

129
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:13,272
ONE HAND DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT THE OTHER
ONE IS DOING.

130
00:06:13,338 --> 00:06:14,439
THERE YOU GO.

00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:26,118
THIS WEEK ON HANDYMAN CORNER,

133
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:30,122
I THOUGHT I'D SHOW YOU HOW YOUR
KITCHEN CAN ALMOST BE AS MUCH
FUN AS YOUR WORKSHOP.

134
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,690
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF THE
FAMOUS CHEFS ARE MEN.

135
00:06:31,757 --> 00:06:33,492
YOU KNOW, YOU SEE THEM ON TV.
YOU KNOW THAT GUY?

136
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,127
WELL, THE FAT GUY.

137
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,129
AND THAT OTHER FELLA...
THE LOUD ONE, THE LOUD GUY.

138
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:39,031
AND THERE'S THE DRUNK GUY.

139
00:06:39,097 --> 00:06:41,199
NOW, THINK OF ALL THE FAT,
LOUD, DRUNK GUYS YOU KNOW.

140
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:43,101
THEY COULD BE CHEFS.

141
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:44,536
AND IF YOU LIKE THE TOOLS,

142
00:06:44,603 --> 00:06:47,873
WELL, THEY COULD DOUBLE
AS KITCHEN UTENSILS...

153
00:07:09,594 --> 00:07:11,296
YOU MIGHT WANT TO
CLEAN THEM OFF FIRST.

154
00:07:11,363 --> 00:07:13,832
YOU DON'T WANT
FOOD ON YOUR CAR.

155
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:15,434
AND IF YOU LIKE POWER TOOLS,

156
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,036
WHY NOT HAVE POWER
KITCHEN APPLIANCES?

157
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:19,938
LOOK WHAT I'VE DONE HERE.
SEE WHAT THIS IS?

158
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:22,040
THIS IS MY OLD BETA MAX.

159
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:25,911
NOW, I DIDN'T JUST THROW IT
IN THE GARBAGE OR GIVE IT TO MY
GRANDMA, LIKE MOST OF YOU DO.

160
00:07:25,977 --> 00:07:27,446
NO, I HOOKED HER UP
TO THE MICROWAVE.

161
00:07:27,512 --> 00:07:28,547
WHY?

162
00:07:28,613 --> 00:07:30,282
WELL, I'LL SHOW YOU.

163
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,851
WHEN I WANT TO HEAT UP,
SAY, A BOWL OF MY SOUP HERE,

164
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:34,853
I JUST PUT HER
INTO THE MICROWAVE,

165
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,354
CLOSE HER UP,

166
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:39,858
AND I JUST PRESS "PLAY"
FOR A FEW SECONDS.

167
00:07:39,925 --> 00:07:42,394
THAT SHOULD GET HER.

168
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:45,230
A NEW KIND OF TV DINNER
I'VE GOT GOING HERE.

169
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:48,166
THAT LOOKS GOOD, DOESN'T IT?
MAYBE SOME OF YOU LIKE TO HAVE
YOUR SOUP EVEN HOTTER THAN THAT.

170
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:50,268
PUT HER BACK IN,
CLOSE HER UP,

171
00:07:50,335 --> 00:07:52,337
AND HIT THE "FAST
FORWARD" ON THAT.

172
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:56,241
YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAVE FOOD
ALLERGIES, YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET
A HEAD CLEANER TAPE IN THERE.

173
00:07:56,308 --> 00:07:59,044
AND THAT SHOULD GET HER.

174
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:02,080
ALL RIGHT. OH, WHY,
THAT'S HOT!

175
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:04,749
WELL, NO PROBLEM.

176
00:08:04,816 --> 00:08:08,820
WE'LL JUST LEAVE IT IN
THERE AND JUST HIT "REWIND,"
COOL HER DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

177
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:10,522
THAT SHOULD DO IT.

178
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:14,226
OH, ALL RIGHT, I MAY HAVE
COOLED THAT A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

179
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:15,827
BUT YOU GET THE
GENERAL IDEA.

180
00:08:15,894 --> 00:08:17,462
TELL YOU ANOTHER BEAUTY
OF THIS UNIT HERE.

181
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:19,097
WHEN YOU WANT TO GET THE
STUFF OUT OF THE OVEN,

182
00:08:19,164 --> 00:08:23,368
YOU JUST HIT THE
"EJECT" BUTTON.

183
00:08:23,435 --> 00:08:24,903
SOUP'S ON, HAROLD.

184
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,339
ACTUALLY, SOUP IS ON HAROLD.

185
00:08:27,405 --> 00:08:29,441
OKAY, THIS BRINGS ME TO
THE NEXT THING FOR THE
HANDYMAN'S KITCHEN.

186
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:32,444
YOUR OVEN CLEANER/FREEZER
DEFROSTER.

187
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:37,015
NOW, WHAT YOU NEED FOR THAT IS
A CAN OF OVEN CLEANER,
ROLL OF DUCT TAPE,

188
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:38,617
A DIRTY OVEN AND
A FROSTY FREEZER.

189
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:44,522
OKAY, FIRST THING, MAKE SURE
THEY'RE ALL FACING UP.

190
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:48,893
OKAY, NOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
IS PUT YOUR OVEN CLEANER
INTO THE FREEZER.

191
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,096
THAT'S RIGHT,
INTO THE FREEZER.

192
00:08:51,162 --> 00:08:52,530
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
YOU HEARD ME RIGHT.

193
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:54,466
SOAK HER REAL GOOD.

194
00:08:54,532 --> 00:09:01,940
NOW, WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS TO
GET YOUR FREEZER UP ON TOP
OF YOUR DIRTY OVEN.

195
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:08,613
(GRUNTING)

196
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,750
WHO MAKES THESE THINGS
SO DARN HEAVY?

197
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:13,385
HEY, THIS IS A VERY
IMPORTANT POINT,

198
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:18,823
MAKE SURE THAT THE DOOR IS OPEN
ON THE FREEZER AND ON THE OVEN.

199
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,159
MAN...

200
00:09:23,928 --> 00:09:25,230
THERE WE GO.

201
00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:26,931
IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE
THEY'RE MATING, DOESN'T IT?

202
00:09:26,998 --> 00:09:29,000
I GUESS THAT'S WHERE
MICROWAVE OVENS COME FROM.

203
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:30,869
ALL RIGHT. THIS IS WHERE
THE DUCT TAPE COMES IN.

204
00:09:30,935 --> 00:09:32,670
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
DUCT TAPE THIS SIZE?

205
00:09:32,737 --> 00:09:34,472
THAT'S THE RELAXED FIT.

206
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:37,308
OKAY, WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
IS MAKE THIS COMPLETELY
AIRTIGHT HERE.

207
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,877
YOU WANNA HAVE A PERFECT SEAL.

208
00:09:38,943 --> 00:09:41,146
THAT'S WHY I PUT THE OVEN
CLEANER INSIDE THE FREEZER.

209
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:43,081
I DIDN'T WANT TO
HURT THE SEAL...

210
00:09:43,148 --> 00:09:45,350
I'LL HAVE THE GREENPEACE
PEOPLE AFTER ME.

211
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,185
SEAL...  GREENPEACE...

212
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:49,487
WHO NEEDS WRITERS?

213
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:58,496
A CAUTIOUS HANDYMAN ALWAYS USES
TEN TIMES AS MUCH TAPE AS
HE THINKS IS NECESSARY.

214
00:09:58,563 --> 00:10:00,598
THAT'S FUNNY, EH?

215
00:10:00,665 --> 00:10:02,800
SOMETIMES YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING,
AND YOU CAN'T BELIEVE YOU BUILT
THAT WITH YOUR OWN HANDS.

216
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:05,036
YOUR PARENTS WILL KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

217
00:10:05,103 --> 00:10:10,475
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TURN
THE OVEN ON HIGH,

218
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:12,310
AND THAT'S ALL THERE
IS TO IT, REALLY.

219
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:13,811
NOW, THE WAY THE RIG WORKS IS

220
00:10:13,878 --> 00:10:16,981
THE HEAT OF THE OVEN GOES UP AND
MELTS THE ICE IN THE FREEZER,

221
00:10:17,048 --> 00:10:20,818
AND THEN THE MELTED ICE --
OR, WATER, AS I LIKE
TO CALL IT --

222
00:10:20,885 --> 00:10:22,287
MIXES WITH THE OVEN CLEANER,

223
00:10:22,353 --> 00:10:24,923
AND IT JUST FLOWS RIGHT
DOWN INTO THE OVEN.

224
00:10:24,989 --> 00:10:27,191
OH!

225
00:10:27,258 --> 00:10:30,795
OKAY, DUCT TAPE --
OKAY, DON'T PANIC.
JUST STAY CALM THERE.

226
00:10:30,862 --> 00:10:34,032
JUST GET THE DUCT TAPE ON IT.

227
00:10:34,098 --> 00:10:36,935
USUALLY I WOULD SAY "IF THE
WOMEN DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,
THEY SHOULD FIND AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY,"

228
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:38,469
BUT THIS WEEK I'M
GOING TO SAY,

229
00:10:38,536 --> 00:10:41,839
IF YOU CAN'T STAND THE KITCHEN,
GET OUT OF THE HEAT.

230
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,417
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU OLDER
TYPES ABOUT MODERN ART.

231
00:10:52,483 --> 00:10:55,019
NOW, I KNOW THE ARTIST IS
SUPPOSED TO SUFFER FOR HIS ART,

232
00:10:55,086 --> 00:10:57,355
BUT THERE'S GOTTA
BE A LIMIT HERE.

233
00:10:57,422 --> 00:11:00,358
I GOT DRAGGED OUT TO ONE
OF THEM MODERN ART MUSEUMS.

234
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:01,893
I HUNG UP MY COAT,

235
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:04,495
AND TURNS OUT THE COAT RACK
WAS ACTUALLY A PIECE OF ART

236
00:11:04,562 --> 00:11:09,133
SYMBOLIZING MAN'S
DYNAMIC SYMMETRY.

237
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,039
NOW, I DON'T KNOW HOW MAN'S
DYNAMIC SYMMETRY CAN BE
SYMBOLIZED BY A NAIL
IN A WALL,

238
00:11:15,106 --> 00:11:16,240
BUT THAT APPARENTLY MEANS

239
00:11:16,307 --> 00:11:18,743
I'M INSENSITIVE.

240
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,079
THEY HAD THIS OTHER THING, JUST
BLOTCHES OF PAINT ON CANVAS.

241
00:11:21,145 --> 00:11:22,914
THAT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE ART TOO.

242
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,451
THEY HAD A BIG STATUE
MADE OUT OF BIRD DROPPINGS,

243
00:11:26,517 --> 00:11:28,953
AND THEY HAD A PICTURE
OF A CAN OF SOUP.

244
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,555
LIKE, HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO
KNOW IF IT'S GOOD ART

245
00:11:30,621 --> 00:11:34,025
IF WE DON'T EVEN
KNOW IF IT'S ART?

246
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:36,360
HERE'S A SIMPLE
RULE I USE...

247
00:11:36,427 --> 00:11:37,528
IF I CAN DO IT,

248
00:11:37,595 --> 00:11:40,932
IT'S NOT ART.

249
00:11:40,998 --> 00:11:42,266
OH, YEAH.

250
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:46,437
(APPLAUSE)

251
00:11:46,504 --> 00:11:48,573
SEE, I CAN FINGER PAINT,

252
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:50,641
SO THAT'S NOT ART.

253
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,477
I CAN CHANT;
I CAN STAND STILL;

254
00:11:52,543 --> 00:11:54,145
I CAN SNEEZE INTO
A PIECE OF PAPER.

255
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:57,315
NONE OF THAT STUFF IS ART.

256
00:11:57,381 --> 00:11:59,917
SO I'M WARNING YOU MODERN
ARTISTS OUT THERE...

257
00:11:59,984 --> 00:12:01,953
EITHER YOU STOP DOING
STUFF I CAN DO,

258
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:05,223
OR I'LL START DOING
STUFF YOU CAN DO.

259
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:09,393
AND THEN, BELIEVE ME, EVERYBODY
IS GOING TO SUFFER FROM MY ART.

260
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,329
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

261
00:12:11,395 --> 00:12:15,399
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

262
00:12:17,768 --> 00:12:20,071
HELLO, POSSUM SNITCH LINE.
DO YOU WANT TO SNITCH
ON SOMEONE?

263
00:12:20,137 --> 00:12:23,441
HA, EXCELLENT. EXCELLENT.
ALL RIGHT, WHO? WHO?

264
00:12:23,507 --> 00:12:25,977
I DO NOT!

265
00:12:26,043 --> 00:12:27,845
NO, I DO NOT.

266
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:32,917
NO, NO, NO, MY MOM SAYS I
HAVEN'T DONE THAT SINCE
I WAS NINE YEARS OLD.

267
00:12:32,984 --> 00:12:36,721
WELL, SHE WOULD KNOW.
SHE DOES THE LAUNDRY.

268
00:12:36,787 --> 00:12:38,889
OKAY, AND BY THE WAY,

269
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:43,160
IT'S NOT A CRIME,
IT'S A CONDITION.

270
00:12:43,227 --> 00:12:47,298
WELL, HAROLD, I SEE YOUR
SNITCH LINE IS BRINGING
OUT THE BEST IN PEOPLE.

271
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:49,133
WE GOT SOME CALLS.
WE GOT SOME CALLS.

272
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,403
WE GOT ONE FROM OLD LADY
BANKMAN. HER CAT HAS
BEEN MISSING...

273
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,705
SINCE 1983.

274
00:12:54,772 --> 00:12:57,308
MOOSE THOMPSON CALLED.
SOMEONE STOLE HIS GREMLIN.

275
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,609
YEAH, HE SAID IF
ANYONE RETURNS IT,

276
00:12:58,676 --> 00:13:01,245
HE'LL HAVE THEM ARRESTED.

277
00:13:01,312 --> 00:13:03,981
HERE'S AN INTERESTING ONE.
FLINTY McCLINTOCK CALLED.

278
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:06,083
SOMEONE STOLE
HIS TOOLBOX.

279
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,851
OH, REALLY?

280
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:09,086
OH, YEAH.
WOW.

281
00:13:09,153 --> 00:13:11,789
YOU KNOW, HAROLD, I THOUGHT YOU
WERE GOING TO BE WALKING THE
STREETS WITH THIS,

282
00:13:11,856 --> 00:13:15,860
NOT BY THE PHONE HERE, LIKE
JO-JO'S SIDEKICK ALLIANCE
OR SOMETHING OR OTHER.

283
00:13:15,926 --> 00:13:17,695
OH, YEAH,
WE ARE.
WE ARE.
WE ARE.

284
00:13:17,762 --> 00:13:20,398
IT'S JUST THAT CHUBBY'S MOM
IS STILL WORKING ON OUR CRIME
FIGHTING OUTFITS, YOU KNOW.

285
00:13:20,464 --> 00:13:24,535
I'M HOPING THEY'RE GOING TO
USE THOSE BIG DRAPES IN
THEIR FRONT WINDOW.
THEY'RE SO COOL.

286
00:13:24,602 --> 00:13:27,271
IF SHE USES THE DRAPES, THEN
I CAN WALK UP AND USE OUR
SLOGAN AND SAY,

287
00:13:27,338 --> 00:13:30,241
"IT'S CURTAINS
FOR CRIMINALS."

288
00:13:30,307 --> 00:13:31,709
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,

289
00:13:31,776 --> 00:13:35,012
DON'T SAY IT OUT LOUD UNLESS
YOU'RE TIRED OF THOSE TEETH.

290
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:36,881
I WAS GOING TO GO OVER THERE
NOW FOR A FITTING, YOU KNOW.

291
00:13:36,947 --> 00:13:38,315
WHILST I AM ON MY WAY OVER,

292
00:13:38,382 --> 00:13:41,318
MAYBE I CAN RETURN THAT
TOOLBOX TO FLINTY FOR YOU.

293
00:13:41,385 --> 00:13:42,686
OH, THIS?

294
00:13:42,753 --> 00:13:44,221
OH, IS THIS FLINTY'S?

295
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:46,957
YOU KNOW,
I THINK SO.
OH.

296
00:13:47,024 --> 00:13:48,759
YEAH, YOU KNOW, HAROLD,
THANK YOU, HAROLD.

297
00:13:48,826 --> 00:13:50,161
APPRECIATE IT.
APPRECIATE IT.

298
00:13:50,227 --> 00:13:52,196
YOU SHOULD BE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELF.

299
00:13:52,263 --> 00:13:53,464
WELL, I USED TO BE,

300
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:58,135
BUT SINCE I HAD YOU AS A
NEPHEW, NOTHING BOTHERS ME.

301
00:14:02,573 --> 00:14:03,707
HELLO, FLINTY?

302
00:14:03,774 --> 00:14:06,176
YEAH, I THINK HAROLD'S
GOT YOUR TOOLBOX.

303
00:14:06,243 --> 00:14:07,845
I HEARD THAT.

304
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,921
NOW, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
YOU CAN DO ON A SATURDAY,

305
00:14:16,987 --> 00:14:18,889
AND I DON'T MEAN RUN OVER
A GUY YOU KNOW.

306
00:14:18,956 --> 00:14:21,592
I MEAN, IT'S A LITTLE
SOMETHING YOU CAN DO
IF YOU'VE GOT A VEHICLE,

307
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:23,627
AND THIS IS SOMETHING NO ONE
EVER DOES ANYMORE.

308
00:14:23,694 --> 00:14:26,730
IT'S ROTATING THE TIRES AND,
YOU KNOW, SWITCHING ONE FOR
THE OTHER, AND SO ON.

309
00:14:26,797 --> 00:14:29,099
BILL HAD A PLAN HERE:
HE'S GOING TO NUMBER
ALL THE TIRES.

310
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,135
AND, YEAH, I THINK, YOU KNOW,

311
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:33,437
I THINK WE UNDERSTAND.

312
00:14:33,504 --> 00:14:36,573
IT RUINS IT, YOU KNOW,
WHEN SOMEONE -- ANYWAY.

313
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,375
OKAY, LET'S JUST GET GOING.

314
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:42,680
FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO
IS JACK UP THE ONE WHEEL.

315
00:14:42,746 --> 00:14:44,081
AND WHICH WHEEL WILL THIS BE?

316
00:14:44,148 --> 00:14:45,916
THIS WILL BE WHEEL NUMBER --

317
00:14:45,983 --> 00:14:51,822
DON'T EXPLAIN IT, BILL.
BILL, LET'S MOVE ON.

318
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:54,825
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS NUMBER
YOUR TIRES, SO YOU DON'T
CONFUSE --

319
00:14:54,892 --> 00:15:01,198
BILL, CHALK IS NOT GOING TO
WORK ON A TIRE, ALL RIGHT?

320
00:15:01,265 --> 00:15:02,433
HE'S GOT ANOTHER IDEA.

321
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:03,801
WHAT'S HE GOT THERE?

322
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:06,570
SILLY --
THAT'S FUNNY.

323
00:15:06,637 --> 00:15:10,340
OH, NO -- OKAY, NO,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

324
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:13,577
IT'S NOT FUNNY.
I WAS WRONG.
IT'S NOT.

325
00:15:13,644 --> 00:15:16,847
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
ALL RIGHT, LET'S
GET ROTATING.

326
00:15:16,914 --> 00:15:19,683
LET'S GET A NUMBER. MARK THAT
TIRE ANY WAY YOU CAN.

327
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:23,420
ANY NUMBER YOU WANT.

328
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:24,922
WELL, HE'S PRETTY GOOD
WITH THAT THING.

329
00:15:24,988 --> 00:15:27,357
NOW, WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR IS A --

330
00:15:27,424 --> 00:15:32,095
OH, BOY. HOLY SMOKE!

331
00:15:32,162 --> 00:15:36,066
WELL, HE MUST HAVE INCREDIBLE
MEDICAL CONDITIONS.

332
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:37,701
WELL, HE'S GOT
ANOTHER ONE NOW.

333
00:15:37,768 --> 00:15:40,337
ALL RIGHT, SO HE'S GOT
ALL THE NUTS OFF THERE.

334
00:15:40,404 --> 00:15:42,439
ALL RIGHT, WATCH YOUR FOOT.

335
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:46,844
BILL, CAREFUL --
OH, THIS IS A --

336
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:50,547
OKAY, THIS IS WHAT WE CALL
A TIME FILLER.

337
00:15:50,614 --> 00:15:51,715
WE'VE GOT TO GET ALL THESE --

338
00:15:51,782 --> 00:15:52,916
THEY'RE ALL OVER
THE PLACE NOW.

339
00:15:52,983 --> 00:15:54,484
WHO'S GOING TO
FIND THOSE?

340
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:56,587
WHY DID I ASK?

341
00:15:56,653 --> 00:15:59,523
ACTUALLY, I DON'T MIND.

342
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:04,861
KEEP ME FARTHER AWAY
FROM BILL AND LESS CHANCE
OF BEING INJURED.

343
00:16:04,928 --> 00:16:07,798
I WISH I COULD SAY
THE SAME FOR THE VAN.

344
00:16:07,864 --> 00:16:11,134
TRY NOT TO GET REVENGE
RIGHT AWAY.

345
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:15,005
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.

346
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:17,240
NO IDEA.
NO IDEA --

347
00:16:17,307 --> 00:16:19,409
I HAVE NO --
I HAVE NO --

348
00:16:19,476 --> 00:16:21,578
ALL RIGHT, SO HE'S GETTING --
THIS IS TIRE NUMBER THREE NOW.

349
00:16:21,645 --> 00:16:23,246
AND JUST PULL THAT RIGHT OFF.

350
00:16:23,313 --> 00:16:26,483
THE RIM IS KIND OF --
PULLED IT RIGHT OFF.

351
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,219
PULLED IT RIGHT OFF
THE RIM THERE, BILL.

352
00:16:29,286 --> 00:16:31,688
WELL, WELL, YOU'RE
DOING A GOOD JOB.

353
00:16:31,755 --> 00:16:39,029
OH, I WAS GOING TO SAY WE'VE
GOT ONE MORE TO GO, AND LOOKS
LIKE YOU'VE GOT IT.

354
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:42,999
I'M NOT HAVING THE BEST
TIME EVER AND I'M THINKING,

355
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:45,902
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO SPEND
THE REST OF THE DAY HERE.

356
00:16:45,969 --> 00:16:50,507
I THINK I'LL HEAD OFF
TO THE RAILROAD TRACKS.

357
00:16:59,883 --> 00:17:02,552
AMATEURS AND IMMATURES.

358
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:05,856
I CALL THEM THE
THREE DORKATEERS.

359
00:17:05,922 --> 00:17:07,424
THEY GOT THE UNIFORMS
AND EVERYTHING.

360
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:09,292
IT'S PRETTY SAD,
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU.

361
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,028
YOU'VE GOT TO SEE --

362
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,475
THAT'S -- THAT'S
QUITE A LOOK, HAROLD.

363
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:27,911
THE BIRD HEAD
IS A NICE TOUCH.

364
00:17:27,978 --> 00:17:31,815
I'M GUESSING THAT'S THE ONLY
CHICK YOU'LL GET CLOSE TO.

365
00:17:31,882 --> 00:17:33,049
IT'S NOT JUST ANY
BIRD EITHER.

366
00:17:33,116 --> 00:17:34,451
IT'S A PIGEON.

367
00:17:34,518 --> 00:17:38,922
WE CALL OUR CRIME FIGHTING
SQUADRON, "THE STOOL PIGEONS."

368
00:17:38,989 --> 00:17:42,425
THE STOOL PIGEON, THAT'S A
MEDICAL TERM, ISN'T IT, HAROLD?

369
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:45,729
IT REMINDS PEOPLE TO PHONE
THE AUTHORITIES IN THE EVENT
OF A CRIMINAL ACT.

370
00:17:45,795 --> 00:17:47,931
YEAH, WE'RE REALLY
REDUCING CRIME.

371
00:17:47,998 --> 00:17:51,268
I DON'T KNOW, HAROLD.
I LOOK AT YOU, I WANT
TO COMMIT ONE.

372
00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:52,802
DO YOU KNOW WHY?
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

373
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:56,039
BECAUSE YOU WERE BROUGHT
UP IN A VIOLENT SOCIETY,

374
00:17:56,106 --> 00:17:57,841
AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO LEARN TO FIGHT THAT.

375
00:17:57,908 --> 00:17:59,175
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO,
WE STOOL PIGEONS.

376
00:17:59,242 --> 00:18:01,544
WE OFFER PEOPLE A REMEDY FOR,
YOU KNOW, FOR CHANGING THINGS

377
00:18:01,611 --> 00:18:03,914
AND GETTING OUT THERE AND
HAVING A NON-VIOLENT WAY
OF REMEDYING

378
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,549
AND KEEPING PEACE
IN THE SOCIETY.

379
00:18:06,616 --> 00:18:08,852
WOW, HAROLD, DO YOU
MIND A LITTLE ADVICE?

380
00:18:08,918 --> 00:18:09,853
NOT AT ALL.

381
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,655
UNLIKE YOURSELF,
I EMBRACE CHANGE.

382
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:14,958
GOOD, GO CHANGE.

383
00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:18,361
NO, I CAN'T BECAUSE ME AND THE
OTHER STOOL PIGEONS HAVE GOT
TO PATROL THE STREETS.

384
00:18:18,428 --> 00:18:21,865
YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO SWOOP
DOWN FROM THE SKIES AND
GET A DROP ON CRIME.

385
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:26,503
DON'T GET ANY DROPPINGS
ON YOUR SHOES.

386
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:31,341
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT
PORTION OF THE SHOW.

387
00:18:31,408 --> 00:18:34,878
THAT PART OF THE SHOW THAT WE
EXAMINE THOSE THREE LITTLE WORDS
THAT MEN FIND SO HARD TO SAY,

388
00:18:34,944 --> 00:18:37,480
Audience:  "I DON'T KNOW."

389
00:18:37,547 --> 00:18:39,349
WAY EXCELLENT!

390
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,284
OKAY, ALL RIGHT. JOINING ME AND
UNCLE RED ON THE EXPERT PORTION
OF THE SHOW THIS WEEK IS

391
00:18:41,351 --> 00:18:46,589
Mr. WINSTON ROTHSCHILD OF
THE ROTSHCHILD SEWAGE AND
SEPTIC SUCKING SERVICES.

392
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,827
WHERE ARE MOTTO IS:
"IF YOUR CUP OVERFLOWS,

393
00:18:50,894 --> 00:18:55,765
"I'LL BE THERE
WITH MY HOSE."

394
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:58,201
OKEYDOKEY.

395
00:18:58,268 --> 00:18:59,669
OKAY, THIS IS OUR
FIRST LETTER.

396
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:01,738
IT'S FROM EDNA KAY, AND
IT GOES AS FOLLOWS...

397
00:19:01,805 --> 00:19:04,507
"DEAR EXPERTS: I WANT TO
GO ON A GRAND VACATION.

398
00:19:04,574 --> 00:19:08,611
"SHOULD I TRAVEL ACROSS THE SEA
OR SOMEWHERE IN NORTH AMERICA?"

399
00:19:08,678 --> 00:19:10,447
ALL RIGHT, EDNA, I WOULD SAY
STAY WITH NORTH AMERICA

400
00:19:10,513 --> 00:19:12,315
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO
BE ABLE TO DRIVE HOME.

401
00:19:12,382 --> 00:19:15,985
I'LL TELL YOU, GET INTO YOUR
THIRD WEEK OF CZECHOSLOVAKIAN
CHEESEBURGERS,

402
00:19:16,052 --> 00:19:18,988
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO SLIDE
INTO THE VAN AND HEAD WEST.

403
00:19:19,055 --> 00:19:21,858
OH, NO, I HAVE GOTTA
BEG TO DIFFERENTIATE
WITH YOU, RED.

404
00:19:21,925 --> 00:19:23,326
EUROPE IS WHERE
YOU WANT TO GO.

405
00:19:23,393 --> 00:19:24,460
THAT'S WHERE ALL
THE HISTORY IS.

406
00:19:24,527 --> 00:19:26,262
THAT'S WHERE SHE
ALL BEGAN.

407
00:19:26,329 --> 00:19:27,430
WHERE WHAT ALL BEGAN?

408
00:19:27,497 --> 00:19:28,865
WESTERN CIVILIZATION.

409
00:19:28,932 --> 00:19:33,469
OR, MORE SPECIFICALLY,
SEWAGE SYSTEMS.

410
00:19:33,536 --> 00:19:38,675
OH, YEAH, YOU CAN STILL GO SEE
AND VISIT THE ANCIENT ROMAN
SEWAGE SYSTEM.

411
00:19:38,741 --> 00:19:42,779
THE FAMOUS
'CLOACA MAXIMA'.

412
00:19:42,845 --> 00:19:44,614
OH, YEAH, I'LL TELL YOU,

413
00:19:44,681 --> 00:19:49,652
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING DOWN
A TOILET DRAIN THAT WAS
BUILT IN 580 B.C.,

414
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:56,159
IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU'RE LOOKING
UP THE BACK END OF YOUR
FAMILY TREE.

415
00:19:59,662 --> 00:20:01,898
WELL, YOU KNOW, MAYBE OUR
VIEWER WOULD LIKE TO
GO TO EUROPE

416
00:20:01,965 --> 00:20:06,836
TO VISIT MUSEUMS AND CASTLES AND
SEE THE SITES, YOU KNOW, WHERE
THE TURNING POINTS OF HISTORY
ACTUALLY OCCURRED.

417
00:20:06,903 --> 00:20:09,739
WELL, YOU KNOW, IF THAT'S
YOUR THING, YOU KNOW.

418
00:20:09,806 --> 00:20:14,811
BUT HOW DOES THAT COMPARE WITH
SEEING THE HOME OF ENGLISHMAN
SIR JOHN HERRINGTON,

419
00:20:14,877 --> 00:20:20,550
WHO IN 1596 HAD THE ONLY WATER
CLOSET IN THE ENTIRE
BRITISH EMPIRE?

420
00:20:20,616 --> 00:20:23,720
WELL, I BET HE HAD
A LINEUP, HUH?

421
00:20:23,786 --> 00:20:28,124
WELL, EDNA, I ADVISE YOU GO TO
EUROPE AND GO OUT AND SEE THINGS
THAT AREN'T AROUND HERE.

422
00:20:28,191 --> 00:20:29,225
OH, FOR SURE.

423
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:31,027
OH, FRANCE, YOU'VE GOT
TO GO TO FRANCE.

424
00:20:31,094 --> 00:20:35,131
OH, YEAH, YOU'VE GOT TO SEE --
YOU'VE GOT TO SEE THE BATHROOM
GRAFFITI IN VERSAILLES.

425
00:20:35,198 --> 00:20:40,703
OH, YEAH, THAT'S WHERE, IN MARIE
ANTOINETTE'S OWN HANDWRITING, IT
SAYS, "LET THEM EAT CAKE,

426
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:45,608
"BUT GO EASY ON
THE BRAN MUFFINS."

427
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,286
YOU KNOW, HAROLD, SOMETIMES YOUR
IDEAS BORDER ON A DEATH WISH.

428
00:20:57,353 --> 00:20:59,355
YOU KNOW THAT, EH?

429
00:20:59,422 --> 00:21:01,257
NO, NO, THOSE KIDS
DIDN'T MEAN ANY HARM.

430
00:21:01,324 --> 00:21:03,593
THEY WERE JUST HAVING FUN.

431
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:06,062
WHAT WERE YOU STOOL PIGEONS
DOING UP BY THE MAIN
HIGHWAY ANYHOW?

432
00:21:06,129 --> 00:21:10,032
WELL, WE GOT THIS PHONE CALL
THAT OLD MAN SEDGEWICK WAS UP
THERE KICKING STONES AT
PASSING CARS,

433
00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:11,601
SO WE WENT TO
CHECK IT OUT.

434
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:12,969
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

435
00:21:13,035 --> 00:21:16,272
OLD MAN SEDGEWICK WAS UP THERE
KICKING STONES AT PASSING CARS.

436
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:18,774
BUT THEN THESE TOUGH GUYS CAME
ALONG AND SAID THEY WERE GOING
TO BEAT US UP,

437
00:21:18,841 --> 00:21:22,078
AND CHUBBY SPEAKS RIGHT UP AND
HE SAYS, "WELL, YEAH, WELL YOU
GUYS ARE JUST ALL TALK."

438
00:21:22,144 --> 00:21:24,347
WHICH WE NOW KNOW
WAS A MISTAKE TO SAY.

439
00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:25,848
YEAH. YEAH.

440
00:21:25,915 --> 00:21:27,049
BUT THEN YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED THEN?

441
00:21:27,116 --> 00:21:28,718
SUSIE CAME BY AND SHE SAYS,

442
00:21:28,784 --> 00:21:33,623
"YOU TOUGHS, DON'T BE HITTING
HAROLD AS HARD AS THE OTHERS."

443
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:36,926
I THINK SHE LOVES ME.

444
00:21:36,993 --> 00:21:40,196
LOVE HURTS,
DOESN'T IT, HAROLD?
TODAY, YES.

445
00:21:40,263 --> 00:21:41,530
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S GREAT?

446
00:21:41,597 --> 00:21:44,634
I THINK SHE JUST TOOK
MY LUNCH TO GET MY ATTENTION.

447
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,136
SHE STOLE IT TO
TAKE MY ATTENTION,

448
00:21:47,203 --> 00:21:49,205
AND THEN SHE
STOLE MY HEART.
OH, BOY.

449
00:21:49,272 --> 00:21:52,675
WELL, IF SHE LIKES SARDINES,
YOU MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE.

450
00:21:52,742 --> 00:21:54,543
(POSSUM CALL)

451
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,045
IT'S MEETING TIME.

452
00:21:56,112 --> 00:21:57,647
YEAH, YOU GO AHEAD, HAROLD.
I'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.

453
00:21:57,713 --> 00:21:59,415
AWAY YOU GO.

454
00:21:59,482 --> 00:22:01,217
TAKE IT EASY FOR NOW.

455
00:22:01,283 --> 00:22:03,853
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING, I'LL BE
COMING STRAIGHT HOME AFTER
THE MEETING.

456
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,656
IT LOOKS LIKE HAROLD MAY
HAVE FOUND A LITTLE BIT
OF PUPPY LOVE.

457
00:22:06,722 --> 00:22:08,290
AND IF IT GOES ANY
FARTHER THAN THAT,

458
00:22:08,357 --> 00:22:09,592
I'M GOING TO TELL
YOU RIGHT NOW,

459
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:12,061
I DON'T WANT ANY OF THE PUPS.

460
00:22:12,128 --> 00:22:14,030
THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

461
00:22:14,096 --> 00:22:16,565
AND ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND
HAROLD AND THE WHOLE GANG UP
HERE AT THE LODGE,

462
00:22:16,632 --> 00:22:18,968
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

463
00:22:19,035 --> 00:22:21,771
(APPLAUSE)

464
00:22:21,837 --> 00:22:29,745
[CAPTIONS PERFORMED BY
CAPTION RESOURCE CENTER]

465
00:22:29,812 --> 00:22:31,047
Harold:  HERE HE COMES.
TAKE YOUR SEATS.

466
00:22:31,113 --> 00:22:35,351
HE'S HERE.
HE'S HERE.

467
00:22:35,418 --> 00:22:38,721
ALL RISE.

468
00:22:40,456 --> 00:22:43,225
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI.

469
00:22:43,292 --> 00:22:45,294
Red:  SIT DOWN.

470
00:22:45,361 --> 00:22:47,096
Harold:  OKAY, WE JUST HAVE
ONE ANNOUNCEMENT TONIGHT.

471
00:22:47,163 --> 00:22:48,531
ACTUALLY, IT'S A WARNING.

472
00:22:48,597 --> 00:22:52,601
IF YOU'RE BOATING AT NIGHT,
WATCH OUT FOR THE
WATER SKI JUMP.

473
00:22:52,668 --> 00:22:56,639
NO, SERIOUSLY, BECAUSE STINKY
PETERSON, HE'S GOING TO BE OKAY,

474
00:22:56,705 --> 00:23:00,543
BUT HE'S GOING TO NEED HELP
GETTING HIS BOAT OFF THE
CHURCH STEEPLE.

475
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:06,348
SO ANY VOLUNTEERS? YOU'VE
GOT TO GO REALLY FAST...
