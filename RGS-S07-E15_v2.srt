1
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:11,111
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW!"

2
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,779
AND NOW, HERE'S A MAN WHO
LAUGHS ALL THE WAY
TO THE BANK,

3
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,080
BUT DRIVES ALL
THE WAY BACK.

4
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,081
YOUR HOST,
YOUR HERO,
MY UNCLE,

5
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,217
RED GRE-E-E-N!

6
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:28,361
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

7
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:29,162
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

8
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,163
APPRECIATE IT.

9
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,931
BIG, BIG EVENT
AT THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

10
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:33,933
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
A DOGSLED RACE.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,668
ALL THE MEMBERS HAVE
BROUGHT THEIR DOGS OVER.

12
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:37,103
WE'VE GOT ENOUGH
FOR A TEAM NOW.

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,805
WE'VE EVEN GOT ENOUGH
FOR A FEW SPARES.

14
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,640
THEY'RE NOT HUSKIES,

15
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,476
BUT THEY ARE HUSKY.

16
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,579
IT'S AMAZING HOW
THEY RESEMBLE THEIR
OWNERS THAT WAY.

17
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:49,149
HAROLD, WHAT YOU
GOT IN YOUR HAIR THERE?

18
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,518
WHAT?
WHAT?
RIGHT THERE.

19
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:53,786
OH, IT'S A TWIG.

20
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:56,589
YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU MAY BE
DRINKING TOO MUCH WATER.

21
00:00:56,656 --> 00:01:01,227
NO, NO, I WAS A VICTIM
OF GANG VIOLENCE.
WHAT?!

22
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:03,029
YES, YES,
I WAS SWARMED.

23
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,198
YEAH, NINE GUYS!

24
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:08,201
THEY THREW ME DOWN
AND SAT ON MY HEAD.

25
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:10,904
NINE GUYS SAT
ON YOUR HEAD?

26
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,374
WHO WAS IT,
THE CIRQUE DU SOLEIL?

27
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,642
OKAY, IT WASN'T NINE,

28
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,977
BUT THE OTHER EIGHT
DIDN'T STOP HIM.

29
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:20,613
IT'S THAT NEW KID,
TUBBY JOHANSSEN.

30
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,182
I DON'T KNOW HIM, HAROLD,
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN TO
STICK UP FOR YOURSELF.

31
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,817
JUST NAIL THE KID, HAROLD.

32
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:26,619
A COUPLE OF QUICK ONES.
JUST NAIL HIM...

33
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:27,987
POW-POW!
NO!

34
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:29,155
THAT'S WHAT I'D DO.

35
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,423
I KNOW.
IT'S NO!

36
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,025
VIOLENCE NEVER
SOLVED ANYTHING.

37
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:36,696
LOOK AT YOU THIS MORNING
TRYING TO HARNESS THOSE
CHIHUAHUAS TO THE SLED.

38
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:40,733
WELL TUBBY AND I,
WE'RE GOING TO RESOLVE OUR
DIFFERENCES THROUGH MEDIATION.

39
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,568
OH, HAROLD,
JUST NAIL HIM.
JUST NAIL HIM.

40
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:45,071
NO, WHAT IS THE
MATTER WITH YOUR HEAD?

41
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:48,875
WELL, FOR ONE THING,
NOBODY EVER SAT ON IT.

42
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:50,977
(APPLAUSE)

43
00:01:51,044 --> 00:02:03,156
[♪♪♪]

44
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:04,390
Red Green:
WELL, THIS WEEK ON THE SHOW,

45
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,759
WE'VE GOT WALL-TO-WALL
ACTION FOR YOU.

46
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:08,394
LOTS OF ACTION HAPPENING.

47
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,330
BOY, LOTS OF ACTION HAPPENING
EVERYWHERE WE GO THERE,

48
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,066
OUT ON THE POND,
EVERYWHERE.

49
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:15,468
HERE'S SOMETHING
YOU DON'T SEE VERY OFTEN.

50
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,470
EVEN HAROLD IS GETTING
A LITTLE ACTION.

51
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,808
YOU KNOW THIS WHOLE DOGSLED
PROJECT IS SHOWING US

52
00:02:21,874 --> 00:02:23,376
THAT THERE'S NO SUCH
THING AS PROBLEMS;

53
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,011
JUST OPPORTUNITIES.

54
00:02:25,077 --> 00:02:27,113
SEE, OUR DOGS ARE ALL
DIFFERENT HEIGHTS, RIGHT?

55
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,583
SO WHAT WE'RE DOING,
WE'RE PUTTING THE DACHSHUNDS
AND CHIHUAHUAS UP FRONT,

56
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,619
AND WE COME BACK THROUGH
WITH THE BASSET HOUNDS
AND THE SETTERS

57
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:34,921
AND THEN THE SHEPHERDS,

58
00:02:34,987 --> 00:02:37,490
AND RIGHT UP TO THE
GREAT DANES AT THE BACK THERE.

59
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:40,893
AND THIS WAY, EVERY DOG
GETS TO SEE WHERE HE'S GOING,

60
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,429
WHICH YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

61
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,833
IS A LOT BETTER VIEW
THAN THEY GET WHEN THEY'RE
ALL THE SAME HEIGHT.

62
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:47,867
(LAUGHTER)

63
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:55,575
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

64
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,611
SO, HOW DID
IT GO, GANDHI?

65
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,181
TUBBY SAT ON
MY HEAD AGAIN.

66
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,717
I THINK NEXT TIME
YOU SHOULD TAKE A CHAIR.

67
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,385
WELL, THERE'S NOT GOING
TO BE A NEXT TIME.

68
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:09,889
I REALIZE NOW THAT TUBBY
IS JUST A PRODUCT OF A
DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY.

69
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,525
I'M SIMPLY GOING TO GO
OVER THERE AND SIT DOWN AND
DISCUSS THIS WITH HIS PARENTS.

70
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,360
OH, HAROLD,
DON'T BE SUCH A WUSS!

71
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:16,862
JUST MEET THE KID
IN THE SCHOOLYARD
AND NAIL HIM!

72
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:18,297
POW! POW!
JUST LIKE THAT.

73
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,665
HE'S A BULLY;
HE'S PROBABLY A COWARD.

74
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:20,766
HE WON'T EVEN SHOW.

75
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:21,901
JUST NAIL HIM.
THAT'S WHAT I'D DO.

76
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,236
NO, NO, I CAN'T HIT
ANOTHER HUMAN BEING AT ALL.

77
00:03:24,303 --> 00:03:25,571
OH, SURE.
PUNCH ME HERE,

78
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,139
PUNCH ME RIGHT NOW.
PUNCH ME IN THE STOMACH.

79
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,608
PUNCH ME RIGHT HERE.
COME ON.
NO! NO!

80
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:31,210
IT WON'T HURT ME.
IT WON'T HURT.
REALLY?

81
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:32,645
YEAH, PUNCH ME
RIGHT THERE.

82
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,913
YOU KNOW WHAT,
LET HER FLY.

83
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,014
WE'LL BOTH
FEEL BETTER.

84
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,515
COME ON.

85
00:03:36,582 --> 00:03:38,384
OKAY.
JUST GO AHEAD.

86
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:43,389
(LAUGHTER).

87
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:56,135
IT'S A GOOD SIZED
TARGET, ISN'T IT?
OH, THAT'S FUNNY.

88
00:03:58,671 --> 00:03:59,405
LIKE THAT?

89
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:02,074
SEE, I DON'T
FEEL ANY BETTER.

90
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:03,242
DO YOU FEEL
ANY BETTER?

91
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,910
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YOU WANT ME TO
HIT YOU AGAIN?

92
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:07,079
NOT RIGHT NOW.

93
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:09,115
NOW?
NO, NOT RIGHT NOW.

94
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:10,549
'CAUSE I DON'T EVER WANT
TO HAVE TO HIT YOU AGAIN.

95
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:12,751
THAT WAS AWFUL.
I DON'T WANT TO
HIT YOU EVER AGAIN.

96
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:14,553
WELL, FINE,
SUIT YOURSELF.

WILL BE PLAYING FOR FOUR HOURS
OF UNLIMITED FUN AND HIGH JINKS

TO GET Mr. MIKE HAMAR TO
SAY THIS WORD.

00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:54,660

AND GO.

OKAY, MIKE,
YOU DO SOMETHING BAD,

AND THE COPS HAVE
NABBED YOU.

112

YOU DON'T TRY TO GET AWAY
WITH IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW
YOU REALLY ARE TO...

114
00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:11,377
NO, OKAY, OKAY.
YOU DO SOMETHING
ELSE WRONG, OKAY,

115
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:14,413

KNOW YOU'RE THE ONE TO...

116
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,814
LIE.

117
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:17,149
NO.

118
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:19,985
SOMEONE ACCUSES YOU.
THEY ARE LAYING...

119

ON THE LINE?

120
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:25,958

129
00:05:40,906 --> 00:05:42,875
I GO TO THE LODGE MEETING,
WHAT DO I DO?

130

(HORSES NEIGHING)

135
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,428
Red Green:
MAN, DON'T YOU HATE THAT?

136
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:04,229
YOU COME HOME AFTER A
TOUGH DAY AT THE RACE TRACK,

137
00:06:04,296 --> 00:06:07,466
AND YOUR WIFE HASN'T FOUND TIME
TO SHOVEL OFF THE DRIVEWAY.

138
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,369
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE IN THE GARAGE,

139
00:06:10,435 --> 00:06:12,271
AND SO IS THE DOOR.

140
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:16,175
YOU KNOW, MOST VEHICLES
ARE NOT DESIGNED TO BE
GARAGE DOOR OPENERS.

141
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:18,744
THE BEST SOLUTION, OF COURSE,
IS TO SPEND YOUR WINTERS
IN FLORIDA,

142
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,546
BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU
ON A FIXED INCOME,

143
00:06:20,612 --> 00:06:23,015
OR MAYBE AN INCOME SO BROKE
IT CAN'T BE FIXED,

144
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:24,816
I THOUGHT I'D TAKE
THIS WEEK'S HANDYMAN CORNER

145
00:06:24,883 --> 00:06:28,287
AND SHOW YOU HOW YOU COULD
MAKE YOUR OWN HEATED DRIVEWAY.

146
00:06:28,353 --> 00:06:29,721
THE FIRST THING YOU
NEED IS A STOVE.

147
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:33,926
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WHEN YOU GET A HANDYMAN

148
00:06:33,992 --> 00:06:37,129
THAT IS KIND OF SHORT ON
EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE

149
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:39,331
HE HAS TO TAKE
A CHANCE WITH LOGIC,

150
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:42,034
AND I'M THINKING,
IF YOU'VE GOT AN OVEN,

151
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,037
IT'S GOT THE CAPABILITY OF
TAKING A SPACE THIS SMALL

152
00:06:45,103 --> 00:06:47,839
AND RAISING HER UP
TO ABOUT 500 DEGREES.

153
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:51,877
SO IT JUST MAKES SENSE THAT
THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH POWER
TO TAKE A SPACE THIS BIG

154
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:54,279
AND RAISE IT UP
TO ABOVE FREEZING.

155
00:06:54,346 --> 00:06:56,782
NOW, I KNOW SCIENTISTS WOULD
PROBABLY SIT DOWN WITH
A COMPUTER

156
00:06:56,848 --> 00:06:59,418
AND FIGURE OUT THE B.T.U.s
REQUIRED AND ALL THAT,

157
00:06:59,484 --> 00:07:01,019
BUT BUT I SAY
LET'S JUST TRY IT,

158
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:02,421
AND IF IT WORKS,

159
00:07:02,487 --> 00:07:03,989
WELL, THEN WE GOT IT RIGHT;

160
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,991
AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK,

161
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:09,895
WELL, AT THE VERY LEAST WE
GOT THROUGH A SATURDAY WITHOUT
BEING FORCED TO GO SHOPPING.

162
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:13,498
OKAY, THE FIRST THING
WE WANT TO UPGRADE

163
00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:15,334
IS THE BURNER

164
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,136
BECAUSE WE NEED SOMETHING
THAT IS GOING TO COVER
A LOT MORE GROUND.

165
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:20,672
I'M THINKING
CHAIN LINK FENCE.

166
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:26,611
I FOUND THIS ROLL JUST
SITTING ON THE SIDE OF
THE MAIN ROAD THERE.

167
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:29,014
ACTUALLY THEY'RE BUILDING
A FENCE ALONG THE SIDE
OF THE FOREST.

168
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,316
HEY, THOSE TREES
AREN'T GOING ANYWHERE!

169
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:33,318
ALL RIGHT, WHAT YOU WANT TO DO

170
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:36,421
IS UNROLL THE FENCE
AND CUT IT, OR WHATEVER,

171
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:38,690
UNTIL IT COVERS THE WHOLE
SURFACE OF YOUR DRIVEWAY.

172
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:04,950
ALL RIGHT,
THERE WE GO.

173
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:08,253
GOT THE FENCE ALL HOOKED UP
THERE JUST LIKE A BURNER.

174
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,525
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO NOW IS HOOK
THE OTHER END UP TO THE VARIOUS
ELEMENTS ON YOUR STOVE.

175
00:08:13,592 --> 00:08:15,327
(EXPLOSION)

176
00:08:15,393 --> 00:08:17,395
THAT'S GOT IT.

177
00:08:17,462 --> 00:08:19,564
(EXPLOSION)

178
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:22,434
OKAY, NOW WE'RE READY TO TURN
OUR SNOW-COVERED DRIVEWAY

179
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,102
INTO A FRESH-COOKED DRIVEWAY;

180
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:26,504
ONE I CALL 'BAKED ALASKA.'

181
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:31,376
YOU SET YOUR OVEN TO
500 DEGREES BAKE,

182
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:34,579
SET YOUR TIMER FOR SPRING,

183
00:08:34,646 --> 00:08:35,480
AND YOU'RE DONE.

184
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:39,317
MAN.

185
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:41,720
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

186
00:08:41,786 --> 00:08:43,788
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

187
00:08:43,855 --> 00:08:47,092
(ELECTRIC SHOCKS)

188
00:08:51,696 --> 00:08:53,198
I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU OLDER FELLOWS

189
00:08:53,265 --> 00:08:56,635
WHO MAY NOT BE WHAT
YOU USED TO BE WAY BACK WHEN.

190
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:58,937
YOU KNOW, AFTER A CERTAIN
NUMBER OF YEARS OF MARRIAGE

191
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:02,807
YOU MAY FIND THAT THE ROMANCE
HAS GONE FROM RED HOT

192
00:09:02,874 --> 00:09:05,377
DOWN INTO THE KIND OF
LUKEWARM AREA.

193
00:09:05,443 --> 00:09:08,913
YOU KNOW, I READ ONE TIME,
IF YOU PUT A PENNY INTO A JAR

194
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,517
EVERY TIME YOU ANDYOUR WIFE
ARE INTIMATE WITHIN THE
FIRST YEAR OF MARRIAGE

195
00:09:12,584 --> 00:09:14,486
AND THEN TAKE OUT A PENNY

196
00:09:14,552 --> 00:09:17,622
EVERY TIME YOU AND YOUR WIFE
ARE INTIMATE AFTER THE FIRST
YEAR OF MARRIAGE,

197
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:20,759
YOU WILL NEVER
EMPTY THAT JAR.

198
00:09:22,694 --> 00:09:27,665
TAKE A MOMENT NOW AND THINK
ABOUT ALL THE PENNY JARS
AT YOUR HOUSE.

199
00:09:27,732 --> 00:09:29,234
BUT DON'T FEEL BAD.

200
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,637
I'M GUESSING YOUR FRIENDS HAVE
A FEW JARS OF THEIR OWN.

201
00:09:32,704 --> 00:09:34,406
LOOK AT THE BRIGHT SIDE.

202
00:09:34,472 --> 00:09:37,542
TAKE IT AS A SIGN OF THE
HOT TAMALE YOU WERE BACK THEN,

203
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:41,079
RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON THE
BURNT-OUT PICKLE YOU ARE NOW.

204
00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:43,948
(LAUGHTER)

205
00:09:44,015 --> 00:09:46,551
YOU KNOW, THE WAY I SEE IT,
YOU'RE PRETTY DARN SMART.

206
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:49,320
I THINK YOU SHOULD DISPLAY
THOSE PENNY JARS WITH PRIDE.

207
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:50,822
ANYBODY CAN BE A STUD,

208
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:54,159
BUT YOU'VE USED IT TO HELP
FINANCE YOUR RETIREMENT.

209
00:09:54,225 --> 00:09:56,060
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

210
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:57,829
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

211
00:09:57,896 --> 00:10:00,498
(APPLAUSE)

212
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,935
OH, YEAH?!
OH, YEAH?!

213
00:10:04,002 --> 00:10:05,870
WELL, I'M GOING TO BE
THERE AT 7 O'CLOCK,

214
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:09,040
AND YOU BETTER BE READY.

215
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:09,974
YEAH!

216
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:12,510
YEAH!

217
00:10:12,577 --> 00:10:13,811
OH, OKAY, YEAH.

218
00:10:13,878 --> 00:10:16,314
I KNOW I AM,
BUT WHAT ARE YOU?

219
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:23,988
TRYING TO GET
A DATE, HAROLD?

220
00:10:24,055 --> 00:10:25,356
NO, NO,
THAT WAS TUBBY.

221
00:10:25,423 --> 00:10:27,358
I'M GOING OVER THERE, AND I'M
GOING TO STRAIGHTEN HIM OUT,

222
00:10:27,425 --> 00:10:31,262
AND I AM TAKING THE
DUKES OF HAZARD WITH ME.

223
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:32,864
NOW YOU'RE TALKING.

224
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:35,199
YEAH, I'M GOING
TO CLEAN HIS CLOCK

225
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:36,668
AND THEN FIX HIS WAGON!

226
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:40,104
HE'S GOING DOWN.
HE'S GOING DOWN.

227
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:42,473
OH, YEAH,
I'M READY.

228
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,610
OH, YEAH,
I'M WILD TONIGHT.

229
00:10:45,677 --> 00:10:48,680
OH, YEAH.
OH, WOW!

230
00:10:48,746 --> 00:10:50,381
COULD HAVE BEEN --
COULD HAVE BEEN.

231
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:51,949
ALL RIGHT, HAROLD, YOU'RE
STANDING UP FOR YOURSELF.

232
00:10:52,016 --> 00:10:52,984
GOOD FOR YOU, HAROLD.

233
00:10:53,051 --> 00:10:54,285
I'M DRAWING A LINE
IN THE SAND, UNCLE RED,

234
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:55,486
I'VE HAD IT.

235
00:10:55,553 --> 00:10:57,689
OH, YEAH, TUBBY IS MESSING
WITH THE WRONG MAROON.

236
00:10:57,755 --> 00:11:01,092
MARINE.
WHAT?

237
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,860
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S GOOD.

238
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:04,696
I'M GOING TO GO OVER THERE,
AND I'M GOING TO SETTLE
THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL.

239
00:11:04,762 --> 00:11:06,364
ALL RIGHT, DO YOU WANT
TO GIVE ME TUBBY'S ADDRESS,

240
00:11:06,431 --> 00:11:08,900
SO I KNOW WHERE
TO SEND THE AMBULANCE?

241
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:11,135
DON'T WORRY, I'M NOT
GOING TO HIT HIM THAT HARD.

242
00:11:11,202 --> 00:11:13,438
OH, I KNOW.

243
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:15,540
(LAUGHTER)

244
00:11:15,606 --> 00:11:18,843
HA HA HA.

245
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,179
YOU DON'T WORRY.
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

246
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:22,880
ALL RIGHT.

247
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:27,952
(In W.W.F. announcer voice)
GET READY TO RUMBLE!

248
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:32,657
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

249
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:36,861
Harold:
WELCOME TO THIS WEEK'S MEETING
OF MEN'S ANONYMOUS.

250
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:40,665
AND, AS ALWAYS, I WOULD LIKE TO
ASK MY UNCLE RED TO LEAD US ALL
IN THE MEN'S ANONYMOUS PLEDGE.

251
00:11:40,731 --> 00:11:42,166
UNCLE RED.

252
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:43,534
Everyone:
I'M A MAN,

253
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:44,969
BUT I CAN CHANGE

254
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:46,571
IF I HAVE TO,

255
00:11:46,637 --> 00:11:48,539
I GUESS.

256
00:11:48,606 --> 00:11:53,811
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

257
00:11:53,878 --> 00:11:57,014
Harold:
AT THIS POINT IN TIME,
AT THIS PARTICULAR JUNCTURE
AT WHICH WE FIND OURSELVES,

258
00:11:57,081 --> 00:12:00,985
I'D LIKE TO ASK Mr. DALTON "H"
TO TELL US HIS STORY.

259
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:02,787
DALTON "H".

260
00:12:02,854 --> 00:12:07,458
Dalton:
OKAY, LAST WEEK MY WIFE AND I
WENT TO SHOP AT PORT ASBESTOS,

261
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:12,196
AND OF COURSE, ALL THE WAY THERE
AND ALL THE WAY BACK SHE HAD
TO TELL ME WHERE TO DRIVE.

262
00:12:12,263 --> 00:12:13,898
UH-OH.

263
00:12:13,965 --> 00:12:15,700
AND I LET HER.

264
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:17,535
YES, YESIREE, I DID.

265
00:12:17,602 --> 00:12:19,437
AND OF COURSE,
YOU'RE ON THE HIGHWAY,

266
00:12:19,503 --> 00:12:21,706
AND THERE'S ALL THESE SIGNS
ALL THE WAY ALONG AND THEY SAY,

267
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:23,641
"PORT ASBESTOS TURN RIGHT,"

268
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:28,946
BUT YOU KNOW, SHE STILL
HAD TO SAY, "TURN RIGHT HERE."

269
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:31,148
I DIDN'T SAY A WORD.

270
00:12:31,215 --> 00:12:32,717
NO, SIR.

271
00:12:32,783 --> 00:12:33,985
AND I DIDN'T DO
THAT BIG SIGH THING,
YOU KNOW, THE ONE?

272
00:12:34,051 --> 00:12:36,854
(SIGHING)

273
00:12:36,921 --> 00:12:39,090
I DON'T SAY A WORD.
I DON'T ROLL MY EYES.

274
00:12:39,156 --> 00:12:41,826
I DON'T DO THE HEAD THING.

275
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,428
NO, SIREE.

276
00:12:44,495 --> 00:12:47,531
I JUST LET HER TELL ME,
AND I DON'T SAY A WORD.

277
00:12:47,598 --> 00:12:49,100
BRAVO!

278
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,935
(APPLAUSE)

279
00:12:51,002 --> 00:12:52,403
ALL RIGHT.
THERE YOU GO.

280
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,605
WE'RE VERY PROUD OF YOU.

281
00:12:54,672 --> 00:12:56,941
I JUST NEED THE GROUP
TO HELP ME WITH ONE THING.

282
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:58,743
ANYTHING.
WHAT CAN WE DO?

283
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:02,046
CAN YOU HELP ME GET MY MY
FINGERS UNCLAMPED FROM
THIS STEERING WHEEL?

284
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,483
OH.
PULL!

285
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:08,552
(APPLAUSE)

286
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:15,192
Red Green:
REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS
WEEK'S ADVENTURE WITH BILL

287
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:17,962
BECAUSE I'M NOT IN IT.

288
00:13:18,028 --> 00:13:19,830
IT'S HAROLD AND BILL
ARE OUT THERE.

289
00:13:19,897 --> 00:13:21,132
THEY'RE GOING TO DO
A LITTLE ICE FISHING.

290
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:23,934
OH, BOY.
OH BOY.

291
00:13:24,001 --> 00:13:25,703
SO MUCH FOR THAT AXE.

292
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,838
OH, OH, THAT'S A CRACK.

293
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:30,074
THAT ICE IS A LITTLE
THIN THERE BOYS.

294
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:31,642
COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF YOURSELVES.

295
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:33,244
YEAH, YEAH,
GOOD PLAN.
GOOD PLAN.

296
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,779
NO, NO, DON'T,
GET OUT.
GET OUT.

297
00:13:34,845 --> 00:13:36,981
GO, GO, GO!

298
00:13:37,047 --> 00:13:38,716
ALL RIGHT, THERE YOU GO.
THAT'S BETTER.

299
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:42,319
THAT'S A LITTLE THICKER,
MUCH LIKE YOURSELF, HAROLD.

300
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:44,021
THERE YOU GO.
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

301
00:13:44,088 --> 00:13:45,923
JUST CHOP A HOLE THERE.
THERE, YOU GO.

302
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,092
OH-OH-OH.

303
00:13:51,762 --> 00:13:53,531
YOU BETTER PUT ICE ON
THAT INJURY RIGHT AWAY.

304
00:13:53,597 --> 00:13:55,432
OH, THERE WE GO.
NOW YOU'RE TALKING, BILL.

305
00:13:55,499 --> 00:13:58,636
THAT'S A POWER AUGER.
THAT'LL CUT A HOLE
RIGHT THROUGH.

306
00:13:58,702 --> 00:14:01,071
JUST GOT TO START THAT
LITTLE PUP UP THERE.

307
00:14:01,138 --> 00:14:05,543
PROBLEM WITH THOSE THINGS,
ONCE THEY START CUTTING YOU'VE
GOT TO KEEP A FIRM GRIP

308
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:07,545
'CAUSE THEY'LL BIND ON YOU,
AND YOU DON'T ALWAYS --

309
00:14:07,611 --> 00:14:09,280
YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET
THE GOOD FIRM --

310
00:14:09,346 --> 00:14:11,916
SHE'S BINDING.
SHE'S BINDING.
SHE'S BINDING.

311
00:14:11,982 --> 00:14:13,717
SHE'LL SPIN YOU.
SHE'LL SPIN YOU.

312
00:14:13,784 --> 00:14:16,153
HANG ON.
HANG ON.
HANG ON.
HANG ON.

313
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,755
OH, MAN!

314
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,458
LATER THAT WEEK,
WE GOT FISHING.

315
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:23,193
HAROLD, YOU'RE GETTING A BITE,
GETTING A BITE.

316
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,462
REEL HER IN.
REEL HER IN.

317
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:27,731
YOU GET A LOT OF LITTLE SMELTS
THIS TIME OF YEAR,

318
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:30,067
SMELTS AND HERRING.

319
00:14:30,134 --> 00:14:33,504
LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE GOT
A NORTHERN PIKE.

320
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:38,108
OH, NO, WHAT THE HECK.

321
00:14:38,175 --> 00:14:41,912
HOLY COW!
THE HOLE GOT A LOT BIGGER.

322
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:43,614
I DON'T KNOW
HOW THAT WORKS.

323
00:14:43,681 --> 00:14:45,749
WHAT IS THAT THING?

324
00:14:45,816 --> 00:14:48,452
IT'S OUR ICE FISHING HUT
FROM LAST SEASON.

325
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:50,921
OH, FOR GOSH SAKE,
SHE'S IN PRETTY GOOD
SHAPE THERE TOO.

326
00:14:50,988 --> 00:14:52,356
BETTER MOVE THAT OVER TO --

327
00:14:52,423 --> 00:14:55,492
YEAH, MOVE THAT OVER TO ANOTHER
PLACE THERE WHERE YOU CAN --

328
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:58,162
THERE, THERE YOU GO.
NOW YOU'VE GOT YOUR
OWN SPOT IN THERE

329
00:14:58,228 --> 00:15:00,130
AND HAROLD AND BILL --
BILL, I THINK YOU SHOULD --

330
00:15:00,197 --> 00:15:02,232
I DON'T THINK THERE'S
ROOM IN THERE --

331
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:04,968
YOU CAN'T GET BOTH OF YOU
AND THE AUGER IN THERE.

332
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:06,637
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN GET
BOTH OF YOU AND THE AUGER --

333
00:15:06,703 --> 00:15:08,972
BILL, BILL, BILL, BILL,
YOU CAN'T --

334
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:12,743
BILL, BILL, YOU CAN'T GET --
BILL YOU CAN'T --

335
00:15:14,711 --> 00:15:15,846
TOLD YOU.

336
00:15:15,913 --> 00:15:17,147
HAROLD, DON'T.

337
00:15:17,214 --> 00:15:18,916
OH, YEAH, I WAS RIGHT.

338
00:15:18,982 --> 00:15:21,618
OKAY, SO THEY GET
THAT IN THERE.

339
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:24,121
NOW, AGAIN BOYS,
BE CAREFUL.
BE CAREFUL.

340
00:15:24,188 --> 00:15:26,590
'CAUSE IF SHE BINDS ON YOU,
THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO,

341
00:15:26,657 --> 00:15:28,625
THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO,
BOYS, IF SHE BINDS ON YOU.

342
00:15:28,692 --> 00:15:30,327
BOYS, SHE'S BINDING.
SHE'S BINDING.
SHE'S BINDING.

343
00:15:30,394 --> 00:15:32,329
BOYS SHE'S BINDING.

344
00:15:32,396 --> 00:15:35,199
SHUT HER DOWN.
SHUT HER DOWN.
SHUT HER DOWN.

345
00:15:35,265 --> 00:15:38,936
YOU NEED A BIGGER ICE SHACK.

346
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:42,272
WELL, THAT'S ENOUGH
FROM THOSE ICE HOLES.

347
00:15:48,412 --> 00:15:51,548
YOU KNOW, THIS IDEA OF HAVING
THE BIG DOGS AT THE BACK
LOOKED GOOD ON PAPER,

348
00:15:51,615 --> 00:15:53,183
BUT ONCE THEY
STARTED RUNNING,

349
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,653
YOU KNOW, THE DOG THAT HAD A
BIGGER STRIDE THERE,

350
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,890
KIND OF ENDED UP GOING UP
AND OVER THE LITTLE DOGS.

351
00:15:59,957 --> 00:16:05,729
SO INSTEAD OF TWO LINES OF DOGS,
WE HAD SORT OF TWO ROLLING
BALLS OF DOGS,

352
00:16:05,796 --> 00:16:09,833
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN OKAY IF
THEY WERE EITHER ALL MALE
OR ALL FEMALE.

353
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:14,738
THE CO-ED THING JUST
DIDN'T WORK OUT AT ALL.

354
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:24,247
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

355
00:16:24,314 --> 00:16:26,817
SO HOW DID IT GO?

356
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:30,787
I WENT UP TO TUBBY'S,
AND I WANTED TO HIT HIM.

357
00:16:30,854 --> 00:16:32,389
I REALLY DID.

358
00:16:32,456 --> 00:16:34,624
BUT YOU KNOW, I JUST REALIZED
AT THE LAST SECOND,

359
00:16:34,691 --> 00:16:36,426
I CAN'T STRIKE
ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.

360
00:16:36,493 --> 00:16:38,562
LOOKS LIKE TUBBY DIDN'T
HAVE THAT PROBLEM.

361
00:16:38,628 --> 00:16:40,297
NO, NOT TUBBY,
HIS DAD!

362
00:16:40,364 --> 00:16:43,600
YEAH, HE CAME OUT AND HE THREW
ME DOWN AND SAT ON MY HEAD.

363
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:45,969
MUST BE GENETIC
OR SOMETHING.

364
00:16:46,036 --> 00:16:48,105
WELL, HAROLD, I WISH
I'D HAVE BEEN THERE.

365
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:50,907
I WOULD HAVE DECKED HIM.
I TELL YOU, HE WOULD HAVE
GONE DOWN LIKE BRI-EX SHARES.

366
00:16:50,974 --> 00:16:55,345
YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I TOLD HIM.
WHAT?

367
00:16:55,412 --> 00:16:57,948
YEAH, I SAID YOU WAIT RIGHT
THERE BECAUSE MY UNCLE RED
IS GOING TO COME OVER HERE,

368
00:16:58,014 --> 00:17:00,250
AND HE'S GOING
TO FIX YOUR WAGON.

369
00:17:00,317 --> 00:17:05,188
WELL, HOW --
HOW DO YOU --
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

370
00:17:05,255 --> 00:17:06,757
WELL, I SAID,
"JUST WAIT HERE,

371
00:17:06,823 --> 00:17:08,692
"AND HE'S GOING TO COME OVER
HERE, AND HE'S GOING TO
CLEAN YOUR CLOCK."

372
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:09,960
C'MON, LET'S GO
CLEAN HIS CLOCK.

373
00:17:10,026 --> 00:17:11,361
YOU KNOW I CAN'T;
I'D LOVED TO,

374
00:17:11,428 --> 00:17:13,130
BUT I'VE GOT
THE DOGS AND I'VE --

375
00:17:13,196 --> 00:17:16,266
WELL, TUBBY'S DAD SAYS
HE'S ONLY GOING TO WAIT
THERE TEN MINUTES.

376
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,434
THEN WHAT?

377
00:17:17,501 --> 00:17:18,502
THEN HE SAID --
YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID?

378
00:17:18,568 --> 00:17:19,569
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT HE SAID.

379
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:20,871
HE SAID HE'S GOING
TO COME OVER HERE,

380
00:17:20,937 --> 00:17:25,976
AND HE'S GOING TO BEAT YOU UP
RIGHT ON YOUR OWN TV SHOW.

381
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:28,078
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

382
00:17:28,145 --> 00:17:29,613
I'M GOING TO GO OVER
AND KICK SOME BUTT.

383
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,083
ALL RIGHT,
KICK HIS BUTT.

384
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:34,651
NO, NO, NO, NO,

385
00:17:34,718 --> 00:17:36,119
I'M GOING TO
KICK YOUR BUTT.

386
00:17:36,186 --> 00:17:37,387
COME ON.

387
00:17:38,288 --> 00:17:39,623
COME ON.

388
00:17:40,524 --> 00:17:42,092
THIS IS THE REPAIR SHOP
PART OF THE SHOW WE CALL,

389
00:17:42,158 --> 00:17:45,595
"IF IT AIN'T BROKE,
YOU'RE NOT TRYING."

390
00:17:45,662 --> 00:17:48,164
JOINING ME THIS WEEK
IS EDGAR MONTROSE.

391
00:17:48,231 --> 00:17:49,566
OH, HI, RED!

392
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:51,902
HI, MOM!

393
00:17:51,968 --> 00:17:55,805
EDGAR IS KIND OF OUR LOCAL
EXPLOSIONS AND DEMOLITIONS
EXPERT HERE.

394
00:17:55,872 --> 00:17:57,540
I WOULDN'T
SAY EXPERT, RED.

395
00:17:57,607 --> 00:18:02,345
I'M MORE OF AN
EXPLOSIVES ENTHUSIAST.

396
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:05,615
SELF-TAUGHT,

397
00:18:05,682 --> 00:18:09,419
FROM THE SCHOOL
OF HARD KNOCKS

398
00:18:09,486 --> 00:18:10,820
AND SOFT APOLOGIES.

399
00:18:10,887 --> 00:18:12,389
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

400
00:18:12,455 --> 00:18:14,057
GOT ANYTHING FOR US
TO FIX HERE TODAY?

401
00:18:14,124 --> 00:18:17,327
OH, I AGREE.

402
00:18:17,394 --> 00:18:21,297
YOU KNOW, RED, I'M HERE
BECAUSE I HAVE THIS HAMMER
THAT NEEDS REPAIRING.

403
00:18:21,364 --> 00:18:23,299
IT'S MY GOOD HAMMER.

404
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:27,604
I USE IT FOR HAMMERING STICKS
OF DYNAMITE INTO TIGHT HOLES.

405
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:30,540
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU JUST
DRILL BIGGER HOLES, EDGAR?

406
00:18:30,607 --> 00:18:32,942
I DON'T LIKE DRILLING.

407
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:34,444
I LIKE HAMMERING.

408
00:18:34,511 --> 00:18:36,346
IT REALLY SHARPENS
THE REFLEXES,

409
00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:38,214
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE
HEAD COMES OFF...

410
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:40,817
LIKE THAT.

411
00:18:40,884 --> 00:18:43,086
WELL, NOW, NORMALLY
WHAT I'D DO HERE

412
00:18:43,153 --> 00:18:45,989
IS DRIVE A METAL WEDGE
IN THERE TO HOLD THAT ON,

413
00:18:46,056 --> 00:18:47,624
BUT WE WANT TO
BE SAFE AND SECURE,

414
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,692
SO I RECOMMEND THE
HANDYMAN'S SECRET WEAPON,

415
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:51,928
DUCT TAPE ON THIS.

416
00:18:53,496 --> 00:18:58,668
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU THROW
A LITTLE DUCT TAPE ON THAT?

417
00:19:01,004 --> 00:19:04,240
HOW ARE THE
EARDRUMS EDGAR?

418
00:19:04,307 --> 00:19:07,811
OH, PROBABLY BY THURSDAY.

419
00:19:10,346 --> 00:19:15,618
OKAY, EDGAR, I UNDERSTAND LAST
WEEK YOU BLEW UP THE OLD FLOUR
MILL UP AT PORT ASBESTOS.

420
00:19:15,685 --> 00:19:16,986
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

421
00:19:17,053 --> 00:19:20,990
BOY, THAT BABY WENT
OFF LIKE A DRY SNEEZE.

422
00:19:21,057 --> 00:19:25,428
A HUGE MUSHROOM CLOUD
OF DURUM SEMOLINA.

423
00:19:25,495 --> 00:19:28,464
TALK ABOUT PRE-SIFTED.

424
00:19:28,531 --> 00:19:31,334
HOW MUCH WOULD YOU GET PAID
FOR A DEMOLITION JOB LIKE THAT?

425
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:33,036
PAID?
YEAH.

426
00:19:33,102 --> 00:19:34,771
OH, NO, RED.

427
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:38,308
JUST SEEING 300 TONS OF FLOUR
SUSPENDED OVER POSSUM LAKE

428
00:19:38,374 --> 00:19:41,344
IS ALL THE PAYMENT I NEED.

429
00:19:41,411 --> 00:19:47,417
I MEAN, TO FLATTEN THAT FLOUR
MILL AND NOT EVEN SCRATCH THE
GAS STATION RIGHT NEXT DOOR.

430
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:49,319
GAS STATION?

431
00:19:49,385 --> 00:19:51,788
NO, NO, NEXT TO THE
FLOUR MILL YOU'VE GOT
THE OLD RAILWAY SHED THERE,

432
00:19:51,854 --> 00:19:53,523
THEN THERE'S
THE BOWLING ALLEY,

433
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,657
AND YOU GOT
THE FOUNTAIN,

434
00:19:54,724 --> 00:19:55,892
THEN THERE'S
THE GAS STATION.

435
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:58,761
IT'S NOT NEXT DOOR
TO THE FLOUR MILL.

436
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:05,001
IT IS NOW.

437
00:20:05,068 --> 00:20:09,539
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

438
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:14,143
OH, MAN.
OH, MAN.
OH, MAN.

439
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,481
(POUNDING ON DOOR)

440
00:20:22,685 --> 00:20:24,620
LET ME IN!

441
00:20:30,026 --> 00:20:31,394
AH, GEEZ.

442
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:33,296
GEEZ.

443
00:20:36,332 --> 00:20:39,068
WELL, THAT
WAS INTERESTING.

444
00:20:40,837 --> 00:20:44,741
TURNS OUT I WAS THE ONE WHO WAS
MESSING WITH THE WRONG MARINE.

445
00:20:44,807 --> 00:20:47,076
YOU COULD HAVE WARNED ME ABOUT
THE SIZE OF THE GUY, HAROLD.

446
00:20:47,143 --> 00:20:48,478
I DIDN'T THINK
IT MATTERED.

447
00:20:48,544 --> 00:20:50,413
YOU SAID, "OH,
I'M GONNA NAIL HIM.

448
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,414
"YOU KNOW, A COUPLE
OF QUICK ONES,

449
00:20:51,481 --> 00:20:52,915
"POP! POP!"

450
00:20:52,982 --> 00:20:54,250
OH, YEAH.

451
00:20:54,317 --> 00:20:56,419
I DIDN'T THINK HE WAS THAT
MUCH STRONGER THAN YOU.

452
00:20:56,486 --> 00:20:59,755
HAROLD, I NEVER THOUGHT AN
18-YEAR-OLD KID WOULD HAVE
A FATHER WHO WAS ONLY 35.

453
00:20:59,822 --> 00:21:03,226
I NEVER EXPECTED HIM TO BE
A HOMICIDAL MANIAC

454
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:05,061
AND A BODY BUILDER.

455
00:21:05,128 --> 00:21:07,396
I'LL TELL YOU, YOU TAKE AWAY
HIS YOUTH, HIS ATTITUDE
AND HIS STEROIDS,

456
00:21:07,463 --> 00:21:08,731
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

457
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:10,166
YOU.

458
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:11,601
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

459
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:13,903
I WAS THINKING IT,

460
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:17,206
BUT IT SHOULDN'T
HAVE COME OUT.

461
00:21:17,273 --> 00:21:18,608
BUT --
REALLY --

462
00:21:18,674 --> 00:21:19,876
BUT YOU'RE FAST.

463
00:21:19,942 --> 00:21:21,244
YOU'RE IN GOOD SHAPE.
YOU'RE FAST.

464
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,745
BOY YOU WERE REALLY
RUNNING THERE.

465
00:21:22,812 --> 00:21:23,913
DON'T BE DOING THAT.

466
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,147
NO, YOU WERE.

467
00:21:25,214 --> 00:21:27,383
I NEVER WOULD HAVE CAUGHT YOU
IF I WASN'T IN THE VAN.

468
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,318
YOU'RE FAST.

469
00:21:29,385 --> 00:21:30,553
I WASN'T RUNNING
OUT OF FEAR.

470
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,689
OH, NO, NO.

471
00:21:33,756 --> 00:21:37,260
STANDING AND FIGHTING THAT GUY
WAS A WASTE OF MY VITAL TIME

472
00:21:37,326 --> 00:21:39,562
AND ORGANS.

473
00:21:39,629 --> 00:21:40,963
NO POINT COUGHING
UP A KIDNEY

474
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,699
IF THERE'S NO RECIPIENT
IN THE AREA.

475
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:46,369
I MEAN, I COULDN'T --
I COULDN'T REASON WITH THE GUY.

476
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:48,671
BUT YOU PROVED YOURSELF
TO BE A BIGGER MAN.
I THINK SO.

477
00:21:48,738 --> 00:21:50,306
YOU TURNED
THE OTHER CHEEK.

478
00:21:50,373 --> 00:21:52,341
AND HE NAILED ME WITH
THE CANOE PADDLE.

479
00:21:52,408 --> 00:21:53,843
SORRY, I SHOULD HAVE
WARNED YOU ABOUT THAT.

480
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:55,311
(POSSUM CALL)

481
00:21:55,378 --> 00:21:56,746
IT'S MEETING TIME.

482
00:21:56,812 --> 00:21:57,947
ARE YOU GOING TO COME DOWNSTAIRS
AND TELL THE OTHER FELLOWS

483
00:21:58,014 --> 00:22:00,249
ABOUT THE SENSELESSNESS
OF VIOLENCE NOW?

484
00:22:00,316 --> 00:22:02,318
I WOULD
IF I HAD WON.

485
00:22:02,385 --> 00:22:05,521
YEAH, OKAY,
NO, OKAY.
YOU GO AHEAD.

486
00:22:05,588 --> 00:22:08,190
SO IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING,

487
00:22:08,257 --> 00:22:10,292
AND I'M THROUGH WITH FIGHTING,

488
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:13,696
BUT I HAVEN'T GIVEN UP ON
THE PHYSICAL INTERACTION
BETWEEN TWO ADULTS,

489
00:22:13,763 --> 00:22:15,698
UNLESS YOUR DAD COMES OVER
TO WATCH THE GOLF CHANNEL,

490
00:22:15,765 --> 00:22:19,769
IN WHICH CASE, THE PENDULUM
MAY SWING BACK TOWARDS
VIOLENCE AGAIN.

491
00:22:19,835 --> 00:22:21,270
TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

492
00:22:21,337 --> 00:22:22,772
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND HAROLD

493
00:22:22,838 --> 00:22:25,074
AND THE WHOLE GANG UP
HERE AT POSSUM LODGE,

494
00:22:25,141 --> 00:22:27,410
YOU KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

495
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:35,117
(APPLAUSE)

496
00:22:35,184 --> 00:22:39,655
[CAPTIONS PERFORMED BY
CAPTION RESOURCE CENTER]

497
00:22:39,722 --> 00:22:41,490
Harold:
HERE HE COMES.
SIT DOWN.

498
00:22:44,927 --> 00:22:46,395
ALL RISE!

499
00:22:50,232 --> 00:22:53,202
Everyone:
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI.

500
00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:55,004
Red Green:
SIT DOWN.

501
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,572
Harold:
JUST GOT ONE QUICK
ANNOUNCEMENT THIS WEEK.

502
00:22:56,639 --> 00:22:59,041
BUSTER HADFIELD LOST
HIS FAVOURITE KNIFE.

503
00:22:59,108 --> 00:23:02,678
HE OVER SHARPENED IT,
AND IT CUT A HOLE IN
HIS PANTS' POCKET.

504
00:23:02,745 --> 00:23:05,214
IT ESCAPED.

505
00:23:05,281 --> 00:23:08,050
HE GOT OFF LUCKY
THAT TIME, HUH?
