116
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:45,658
'HANDYMAN CORNER' I GOT

117
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:46,592
SOMETHING A LITTLE

118
00:03:46,592 --> 00:03:47,526
BIT DIFFERENT FOR YOU,

119
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:48,494
I GOT AN ANNIVERSARY COMING UP

120
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:49,428
AND I WANTED TO DO

121
00:03:49,428 --> 00:03:50,563
SOMETHING SPECIAL,

122
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,964
SO I THOUGHT I'D MAYBE CREATE

123
00:03:51,964 --> 00:03:53,099
SOME SPECIAL GIFTS THAT YOU

124
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,867
COULD GIVE TO SAY YOUR WIFE

125
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,268
OR MAYBE YOUR GIRLFRIEND,

126
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:57,470
OR EVEN THAT VERY SPECIAL WOMAN

127
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,806
IN YOUR LIFE OR ALL 3 YOU KNOW.

128
00:04:00,806 --> 00:04:02,708
SO I'M THINKING TO MYSELF,

129
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:03,576
WELL FOR STARTERS MAYBE WE

130
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,744
CAN CREATE OUR OWN SPECIAL

131
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,112
KIND OF LADY SHAVER,

HAROLD WILL YOU?

134
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,316
AND I'M THINKING TO MYSELF,

135
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,685
WHY DON'T WE JUST USE DUCT TAPE

136
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:13,619
TO SAY SHAVE A LEG BECAUSE IT

137
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:14,453
TAKES A LONG TIME TO SHAVE

138
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:17,723
A LEG DOESN'T IT HAROLD?

139
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:18,624
JUST KIDDING YOU, ALL RIGHT,

140
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:21,694
SO YOU GET A PIECE OF DUCT TAPE

141
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:22,461
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU

142
00:04:22,461 --> 00:04:23,262
GOT NO CREAM TO WORRY ABOUT,

143

NO SHARP BLADES AND

144
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:26,899
NO MESSY CLEANUP,

145
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,300
YOU JUST STICK HER ON THERE

146
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,168
AND JUST SNAP IT RIGHT

147
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:33,739
OFF LIKE THIS,

148
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:36,342

ON ROCK REEF POINT YOU KNOW?

340
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:18,850
>>JOSHUA: ROCK REEF POINT IS

341
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,084
NOT ZONED FOR COTTAGE RED,

342
00:10:20,084 --> 00:10:22,287
IT'S A BIRD SANCTUARY.

343
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:23,955
>>RED: WHAT, ARE YOU SURE?

344
00:10:23,955 --> 00:10:25,356
>>JOSHUA: YEAH I TRIED TO BUY

345
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:27,825
IT ONCE FOR A LANDFILL SITE,

346
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:28,993
THE LAWYERS WERE ALL OVER ME.

347
00:10:28,993 --> 00:10:30,061
IF HE TRIES TO BUILD ANYTHING

348
00:10:30,061 --> 00:10:31,496
UP THERE THE ECHO FREAKS WILL

349
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:34,132
JUST MAKE HIM TEAR IT DOWN.

350
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:34,866
>>RED: BY GOLLY I BETTER

351
00:10:34,866 --> 00:10:35,700
GO TELL HIM.

352
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,136
>>JOSHUA: MMM HMM.

353
00:10:38,136 --> 00:10:38,937
>>RED: HOW DO I GET

354
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:43,207
OUT OF HERE?

355
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:46,778
>>JOSHUA: OH NO!

356
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:49,113
>>RED: OH I'LL HELP YOU.

357
00:10:49,113 --> 00:10:50,114
>>JOSHUA: MAN I NEED

358
00:10:50,114 --> 00:10:53,584
A SECRETARY REAL BAD.

359
00:10:57,088 --> 00:10:58,056
>>RED: WELL BEFORE I COULD

360
00:10:58,056 --> 00:10:59,057
STOP HIM, OLD MAN SEDGEWICK

361
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:00,258
AND THE GUYS HAD THE

362
00:11:00,258 --> 00:11:01,392
WHOLE COTTAGE BUILT,

363
00:11:01,392 --> 00:11:02,360
HE EVEN HAD A ROOF ON HER.

364
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,394
IT WASN'T ON THE TOP BUT

365
00:11:03,394 --> 00:11:05,797
IT WAS ON THERE SOMEWHERE.

366
00:11:05,797 --> 00:11:07,632
>>HAROLD: WHAT A MESS TOO,

367
00:11:07,632 --> 00:11:09,067
BOY THERE WAS A CHIMNEY THAT

368
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:10,968
ALL ZIG-ZAGGED OUT THE DOORWAY,

369
00:11:10,968 --> 00:11:12,103
AND THERE WAS WIRES IN THE

370
00:11:12,103 --> 00:11:13,304
BOTTOM OF THE TUB WHICH WAS

371
00:11:13,304 --> 00:11:14,539
OUT ON THE FRONT PORCH

372
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:16,674
WHICH WAS IN THE BASEMENT.

373
00:11:16,674 --> 00:11:17,608
HOW'S A GUY SUPPOSE TO CLOSE

374
00:11:17,608 --> 00:11:18,609
THE WINDOW WITH ALL THE

375
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:19,844
PLUMBING COME OUT OF

376
00:11:19,844 --> 00:11:21,646
IT LIKE THAT?

377
00:11:21,646 --> 00:11:22,714
>>RED: WELL THEY'RE JUST

378
00:11:22,714 --> 00:11:23,748
NOT ALL THAT GOOD AT

379
00:11:23,748 --> 00:11:24,582
READING THE BLUEPRINT.

380
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:25,450
>>HAROLD: WELL MAYBE

381
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,551
IF THEY LOOKED AT IT,

382
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:27,819
IT MIGHT BE A GOOD FIRST STEP.

383
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:29,087
I THINK THE REAL PROBLEM

384
00:11:29,087 --> 00:11:30,121
CAME THOUGH IS WHEN THEY

385
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:31,189
DIVIDED THE GUYS INTO 2 TEAMS

386
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:35,560
AND MADE A RACE OUT OF IT,

387
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,527
BOY THAT'S WHEN THEY REALLY

388
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:38,196
STARTED CUTTING CORNERS THERE.

389
00:11:38,196 --> 00:11:38,996
>>RED: YEAH I THINK THAT'S

390
00:11:38,996 --> 00:11:39,931
WHY SO MANY OF THE ROOMS

391
00:11:39,931 --> 00:11:42,266
ARE TRIANGULAR.

392
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:43,267
BUT DON'T FORGET THESE ARE

393
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:44,302
VOLUNTEERS HAROLD AND IN

394
00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:45,403
THE LONG RUN VOLUNTEERS

395
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:47,138
ARE THE MOST EXPENSIVE WORKERS

396
00:11:47,138 --> 00:11:52,410
YOU'LL EVER HAVE.

397
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,244
SO ANYWAY AFTER THEY INSTALLED

398
00:11:53,244 --> 00:11:55,079
THE SHOWER IN THE KITCHEN,

399
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,481
IN THE ATTIC,

400
00:11:57,481 --> 00:11:58,516
THEY WANTED TO FIRE UP THE GAS

401
00:11:58,516 --> 00:11:59,550
WATER HEATER AND WHEN THEY

402
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,918
TURNED EVERYTHING ON WATER WAS

403
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:02,086
COMING OUT OF THE GAS LINE BUT

404
00:12:02,086 --> 00:12:03,020
NOTHING WAS COMING OUT

405
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,021
OF THE WATERLINE,

406
00:12:04,021 --> 00:12:04,922
SO JUNIOR SINGLETON WENT

407
00:12:04,922 --> 00:12:05,923
DOWN INTO THE BASEMENT TO SEE

408
00:12:05,923 --> 00:12:07,491
WHO HAD HOOKED UP THE GAS

409
00:12:07,491 --> 00:12:08,593
AND AS SOON AS HE HIT THE SWITCH

410
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:09,594
HE REMEMBERED THE ANSWER

411
00:12:09,594 --> 00:12:12,730
WAS NOBODY BECAUSE THE

412
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,365
WHOLE PLACE EXPLODED.

413
00:12:14,365 --> 00:12:16,267
>>HAROLD: IS THAT WHAT THAT WAS?

414
00:12:16,267 --> 00:12:17,101
I THOUGHT THEY WERE BLASTING

415
00:12:17,101 --> 00:12:18,736
IN THE QUARRY AGAIN,

416
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:19,503
OF COURSE I DID WONDER WHEN

417
00:12:19,503 --> 00:12:20,438
I LOOKED UP AND I SAW

418
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:23,407
THAT COTTAGE IN THE SKY.

419
00:12:23,407 --> 00:12:24,141
>>RED: YEAH YOU DON'T

420
00:12:24,141 --> 00:12:25,176
SEE THAT TOO OFTEN.

421
00:12:25,176 --> 00:12:26,110
>>HAROLD: WELL IT'S ONLY

422
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,947
THE SECOND TIME THIS YEAR.

423
00:12:29,947 --> 00:12:30,948
>>RED: BUT THERE'S A GOOD SIDE

424
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:31,916
BECAUSE NOW OLD MAN SEDGEWICK

425
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:32,917
DOESN'T HAVE TO TEAR THE

426
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:33,851
COTTAGE APART JUST TO COMPLY

427
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:35,586
WITH THE ZONING BYLAW

428
00:12:35,586 --> 00:12:36,487
ALTHOUGH THEY MAY CHARGE

429
00:12:36,487 --> 00:12:38,823
HIM WITH LITTERING.

430
00:12:38,823 --> 00:12:40,224
>>HAROLD: THE POOR OLD GUY,

431
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:41,192
I GUESS HE'S REALLY UPSET HUH?

432
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:42,159
>>RED: WELL HE'S NOT

433
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:42,960
A QUITTER HAROLD,

434
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,195
IF HE WAS HE WOULD OF

435
00:12:44,195 --> 00:12:45,596
DIED LONG AGO DURING THE

436
00:12:45,596 --> 00:12:49,333
WAR OF 1812.

437
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,534
BUT AS HE WAS SITTING THERE

438
00:12:50,534 --> 00:12:51,802
IN THAT BIG PILE OF SPLINTERED

439
00:12:51,802 --> 00:12:54,038
WOOD WITH LITTLE TUFTS OF

440
00:12:54,038 --> 00:12:57,041
PINK INSULATION AROUND HIM,

441
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,175
BLOWING PIECES OF SHINGLE

442
00:12:58,175 --> 00:13:01,212
OUT OF HIS NOSE, A BIG BLUE

443
00:13:01,212 --> 00:13:02,480
HERON FLEW OVER AND DROPPED

444
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,984
A WAKEUP CALL ON HIS BALD SPOT

445
00:13:06,984 --> 00:13:09,053
AND HE GOT AN IDEA,

446
00:13:09,053 --> 00:13:11,255
HE'S THINKING, OKAY IF ROCK REEF

447
00:13:11,255 --> 00:13:12,390
POINT HAS BEEN MADE INTO A

448
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,158
BIRD SANCTUARY WHAT HE'LL BUILD

449
00:13:14,158 --> 00:13:21,665

00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,735
WAS REAL LONG SO I THOUGHT

465
00:13:57,735 --> 00:13:58,802
I'D GET SOME OF THE BIRD

466
00:13:58,802 --> 00:14:00,971
DROPPINGS OFF THE TOP OF VAN

467
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:05,009
AND THEN BILL CAME OVER.

468
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:05,943
NEVER MIND BILL I'M FINE,

469
00:14:05,943 --> 00:14:07,011
YEAH I'LL BE RIGHT THERE

470
00:14:07,011 --> 00:14:09,246
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

471
00:14:09,246 --> 00:14:09,947
IT'S TIME FOR

472
00:14:09,947 --> 00:14:11,782
'ADVENTURES WITH BILL'.

473
00:14:11,782 --> 00:14:12,683
NOW WHAT BILL WANTED TO SHOW US

474
00:14:12,683 --> 00:14:14,485
ABOUT THIS WEEK WHICH I DIDN'T

475
00:14:14,485 --> 00:14:16,420
REALIZE WAS HOW TO SURVIVE

476
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,689
IN YOUR CAR,

477
00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:20,424
AND BELIEVE ME SURVIVING

478
00:14:20,424 --> 00:14:23,627
IN BILL'S CAR IS A CHALLENGE.

479
00:14:23,627 --> 00:14:24,862
WE WENT WAY BEHIND THE LODGE,

480
00:14:24,862 --> 00:14:26,697
GOT INTO THE BUSH THERE,

481
00:14:26,697 --> 00:14:28,299
I DON'T THINK BILL WAS,

482
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:31,835
OH, OH, OH, OH, ALL RIGHT,

483
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:33,170
SO NOW WHAT WE'RE SAYING

484
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,305
IS YOU'RE STUCK,

485
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:35,072
WELL WE'RE NOT SAYING IT,

486
00:14:35,072 --> 00:14:36,740
WE ARE...

487
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,275
ANYWAY BILL IS SAYING YOU

488
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:40,711
CAN SURVIVE STUCK IN A CAR,

489
00:14:40,711 --> 00:14:42,212
YOU CAN, ALL RIGHT.

490
00:14:42,212 --> 00:14:43,147
YOU CAN RUB YOUR STOMACH,

491
00:14:43,147 --> 00:14:44,081
NO, NO, I SEE YOU CAN

492
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:45,716
FEED YOURSELF,

493
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:47,718
YOU GET A DRINK, OH, OH, OH,

494
00:14:47,718 --> 00:14:50,120
YOU GET A DRINK OUT OF THE

495
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,821
RAD APPARENTLY, SO YOU JUST

496
00:14:50,821 --> 00:14:51,555
REACH OVER AND UNDO THE

497
00:14:51,555 --> 00:14:52,389
THING THERE, IT MIGHT

498
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:53,190
BE HOT THOUGH BUT..

499
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:56,527
(BILL CHOKING & GAGGING)

500
00:14:56,527 --> 00:14:58,462
>>RED: NO IT SEEMS FINE.

501
00:14:58,462 --> 00:14:59,596
AND YOU PUT THE STRAW IN THERE

502
00:14:59,596 --> 00:15:00,597
HE SAYS THAT WORKS,

503
00:15:00,597 --> 00:15:01,598
I DON'T KNOW THOUGH IT

504
00:15:01,598 --> 00:15:03,734
DOESN'T SEEM, WELL YOU GOT

505
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:05,169
A BIT OF A SHORT STRAW

506
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:05,936

507
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:06,770
>>BILL: EW!

508
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,604
>>RED: BUT YOU WANT TO BE

509
00:15:07,604 --> 00:15:09,139
SPOTTED FROM THE AIR

510
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:10,340
THAT'S THE BIG THING,

511
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,141
NOBODY IS GOING TO COME DRIVING

512
00:15:11,141 --> 00:15:12,109
BY OUT IN THE FIELDS,

513
00:15:12,109 --> 00:15:12,976
SO YOU PUT LIKE A SIGN

514
00:15:12,976 --> 00:15:13,844
LIKE THIS ON YOUR RADIO

515
00:15:13,844 --> 00:15:16,513
AERIAL HERE, THIS SAYS YEAH

516
00:15:16,513 --> 00:15:18,582
HELP, IT'S RIGHT IN MY FACE,

517
00:15:18,582 --> 00:15:19,516
I CAN'T SEE, OH, ALL RIGHT,

518
00:15:19,516 --> 00:15:21,285
WELL MAYBE IF YOU CAN'T PUT IT

519
00:15:21,285 --> 00:15:22,019
ON THE RADIO AERIAL THEN PUT

520
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:23,187
IT ON YOUR DOOR HANDLE,

521
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:24,588
SOMEWHERE WHERE AGAIN IT

522
00:15:24,588 --> 00:15:26,290
CAN BE SPOTTED.

523
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:30,394
OH, YOU WANT TO BE DOING

524
00:15:30,394 --> 00:15:32,563
THIS WITH A BETTER CAR I THINK.

525
00:15:32,563 --> 00:15:33,764
NOW BILL'S GOING TO COOK US UP,

526
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:34,731
HE'S GOT SOME CORN THERE,

527
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:36,033
HE JUST WRAPS IT UP IN THE TIN,

528
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:37,968
WE GOT SOME FISH AND SOME

529
00:15:37,968 --> 00:15:45,075
ASSORTED CANS OF STUFF

530
00:15:45,075 --> 00:15:46,310
AND MORE FISH AND SOME PA...

531
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,277
WHAT ARE THOSE?

00:15:47,277 --> 00:15:49,012
OH THOSE ARE WIENERS OKAY.

533
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:50,581
HE'S PUTTING EVERYTHING IN THERE

534
00:15:50,581 --> 00:15:54,184
THAT'S A RUNNING SHOE THERE BILL

535
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:56,553
AND HE GETS THAT ALL IN THERE

536
00:15:56,553 --> 00:15:57,387
AND STUFFS IT ALL AROUND

537
00:15:57,387 --> 00:15:58,488
THE ENGINE, THE PARTS THAT

538
00:15:58,488 --> 00:15:59,456
GET HOT WHEN YOU TURN

539
00:15:59,456 --> 00:16:00,824
THE ENGINE ON AND

540
00:16:00,824 --> 00:16:02,726
THE IDEA IS HE'S GOING TO

541
00:16:02,726 --> 00:16:05,128
TO START HER UP, WHAT'S THAT?

542
00:16:05,128 --> 00:16:07,898

00:16:07,898 --> 00:16:09,600
HE'S GOING TO PUT THAT IN THERE

544
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,201
AND NOW WHEN HE STARTS HER UP,

545
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:12,769
THE MANIFOLDS AND WHAT HAVE YOU

546
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:17,841

00:16:21,244 --> 00:16:22,379
HE'S GOT THE RUBBER PANEL

550
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:24,181
IN THOSE COVERALLS.

551
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:25,182
AND HE GETS IN THERE AND

552
00:16:25,182 --> 00:16:26,350
HE STARTS HER UP AND SHE'S

553
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,752
RUNNING REAL GOOD,

554
00:16:28,752 --> 00:16:29,553
WELL 2 OF THE CYLINDERS

555

00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:43,133
SPOTTED FROM THE AIR,

561
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:43,934
AND ALL THIS TIME I THOUGHT

562
00:16:43,934 --> 00:16:44,735
BILL HAD NO IDEA WHAT

563
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:45,802
HE WAS DOING.

564
00:16:45,802 --> 00:16:47,337
YOU'RE A GENIUS BILL,

565
00:16:47,337 --> 00:16:50,240
YOU ARE A GENIUS.

566

OKAY, I MEAN GUEST FOR

MY HAT INTO THE RING,

588
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:33,884
WELL IF I HAD A HAT I WOULD

FROM MY MISTAKES AS I RUN

596

602

SO LET ME SAY THIS ABOUT...

606
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:03,179
>>RED: HAROLD YOU'LL NEVER

607
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:03,914
MAKE IT WITH YOUR MARKS OKAY,

608
00:18:03,914 --> 00:18:04,714
PRESIDENTS HAVE TO HAVE

609
00:18:04,714 --> 00:18:05,815
A HIGH EDUCATION.

610
00:18:05,815 --> 00:18:06,650
>>HAROLD: WHAT ABOUT ABE LINCOLN

611
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,484
HE WASN'T MUCH OF AN

612
00:18:07,484 --> 00:18:08,518
EDUCATED GUY.

613
00:18:08,518 --> 00:18:09,452
>>RED: HE WAS

614
00:18:09,452 --> 00:18:12,922
ASSASSINATED HAROLD.

615
00:18:12,922 --> 00:18:13,757
>>HAROLD: GOOD POINT.

616
00:18:13,757 --> 00:18:16,660
>>RED: YUP.

617
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,629
>>HAROLD: WELL MAYBE I COULD

618
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:22,999
BE GUEST FOR THE PRESIDENT.

619
00:18:26,936 --> 00:18:27,937
>>RED: I GUESS IT MUST BE

620
00:18:27,937 --> 00:18:29,039
PRETTY CONFUSING TO BE A

621
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,207
TEENAGE BOY IN THIS DAY AND AGE

622
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:32,308
WITH ALL THE TV ADS SAYING SEX,

623
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:33,810
SEX, SEX, AND YOUR FRIENDS

624
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,311
SAYING SEX, SEX, SEX, AND THE

625
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:36,713
MUSIC VIDEOS SAYING SEX, SEX,

626
00:18:36,713 --> 00:18:37,814
SEX, AND YOUR PARENTS SAYING

627
00:18:37,814 --> 00:18:40,350
HOW WAS SCHOOL TODAY?

628
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,152
WELL I REMEMBER IN MY DAY,

629
00:18:42,152 --> 00:18:43,286
YOU KNOW IN MY DAY THE GIRLS

630
00:18:43,286 --> 00:18:44,387
WORE SKIRTS AND DRESSES

631
00:18:44,387 --> 00:18:45,388
AND IF YOUR GIRLFRIEND SAID

632
00:18:45,388 --> 00:18:48,158
THE 'F' WORD IT WAS FIANCÉE.

633
00:18:48,158 --> 00:18:49,426
WE PUT GIRLS UP ON A PEDESTAL

634
00:18:49,426 --> 00:18:50,326
AND IT WASN'T JUST TO

635
00:18:50,326 --> 00:18:51,461
LOOK UP THEIR DRESSES,

636
00:18:51,461 --> 00:18:52,495
BUT I GUESS WE WERE WRONG

637
00:18:52,495 --> 00:18:53,463
BECAUSE THE LAST 20 YEARS

638
00:18:53,463 --> 00:18:54,464
WOMEN HAVE GONE FOR THE

639
00:18:54,464 --> 00:18:55,765
EQUALITY THING AND THEY'VE

640
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:56,966
ALMOST WORKED THEIR WAY

641
00:18:56,966 --> 00:18:58,868
DOWN TO OUR LEVEL, ALMOST,

642
00:18:58,868 --> 00:18:59,702
ALTHOUGH I HAVE YET TO SEE A

643
00:18:59,702 --> 00:19:00,670
WOMAN ACTUALLY SCRATCH

644
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,539
HERSELF AT THE TABLE.

645
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:03,606
I DON'T GET IT THOUGH

646
00:19:03,606 --> 00:19:04,874
BECAUSE BEING EQUAL TO SAY

647
00:19:04,874 --> 00:19:07,110
A MEMBER OF POSSUM LODGE

648
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,512
IS PRETTY MUCH AN INSULT,

649
00:19:09,512 --> 00:19:11,314
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT

650
00:19:11,314 --> 00:19:12,682
THEN AGAIN IF I UNDERSTOOD WOMAN

651
00:19:12,682 --> 00:19:20,790
I WOULDN'T BE WHERE I AM TODAY.

652
00:19:21,858 --> 00:19:22,759
>>RED: THOUGHT I'D DROP IN

653
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:23,860
ON RANGER GORD AND ASK HIM ABOUT

654
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,128
THIS NEST BUSINESS AND MAKE SURE

655
00:19:25,128 --> 00:19:26,763
THAT HE DIDN'T PANIC WHEN HE

656
00:19:26,763 --> 00:19:27,630
SAW OLD MAN SEDGEWICK'S COTTAGE

657
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:31,568
BLOW UP THIS MORNING.

658
00:19:31,568 --> 00:19:32,402
WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN

659
00:19:32,402 --> 00:19:33,536
OLD MAN SEDGEWICK'S PLACE

660
00:19:33,536 --> 00:19:34,637
EXPLODED UP AT ROCK REEF POINT

661
00:19:34,637 --> 00:19:37,874
THIS MORNING?

662
00:19:37,874 --> 00:19:39,842
>>GORD: EXPLODED?

663
00:19:39,842 --> 00:19:40,743
>>RED: OH YEAH, DIDN'T YOU

664
00:19:40,743 --> 00:19:41,911
SEE THE FLAME AND THE SMOKE,

665
00:19:41,911 --> 00:19:46,316
IT BURNED FOR OVER AN HOUR.

666
00:19:46,316 --> 00:19:47,550
>>GORD: YOU CAN'T

667
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,519
CATCH THEM ALL.

668
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:50,753
>>RED: NO, I GUESS.

669
00:19:50,753 --> 00:19:51,888
ANYWAY ON THIS NEST THING,

670
00:19:51,888 --> 00:19:53,122
YOU KNOW THAT BIRD,

671
00:19:53,122 --> 00:19:54,290
THE BLUE HERON THERE,

672
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,425

00:20:13,943 --> 00:20:15,945
A WOMAN IN HIS LITTLE NEST,

686

I'LL SEE MYSELF DOWN.

720
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:14,170
>>RED: WELL OLD MAN SEDGEWICK

721
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,204
HAS RUN INTO A FEW PROBLEMS

722
00:21:15,204 --> 00:21:16,506
BUILDING HIS BIG NEST,

723
00:21:16,506 --> 00:21:17,573
HE'S BEEN STUDYING THE HERON

724
00:21:17,573 --> 00:21:18,774
AND TRYING TO IMITATE HIM

725
00:21:18,774 --> 00:21:20,042
EXACTLY BUT HE'S FOUND THAT

726
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:21,444
HIS FALSE TEETH MAKE IT REAL

727
00:21:21,444 --> 00:21:22,478
HARD TO PICK UP SOME OF

728
00:21:22,478 --> 00:21:25,147
THE BIGGER 2 BY 4'S.

729
00:21:25,147 --> 00:21:25,982
>>HAROLD: DID HE NOT THINK

730
00:21:25,982 --> 00:21:26,916
TO USE HIS HANDS,

731
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,484
DID THIS NOT OCCUR TO HIM?

732
00:21:28,484 --> 00:21:29,452
>>RED: WELL HE'S A BIT OF

733
00:21:29,452 --> 00:21:30,486
A PUREST YOU KNOW HAROLD,

734
00:21:30,486 --> 00:21:31,420
HE WANTS HIS NEST TO BE

735
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,521
AUTHENTIC YOU KNOW FOR

736
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:34,290
RESALE VALUE.

737
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,157
AND IF THE HERRING IS BUILDING

738
00:21:35,157 --> 00:21:36,392
HIS WITH A BEAK AND ABOUT

739
00:21:36,392 --> 00:21:37,460
THE SAME SIZE BRAIN,

740
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,497
HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT TOO.

741
00:21:41,497 --> 00:21:42,498
SO HE TOOK THE FALSE TEETH OUT

742
00:21:42,498 --> 00:21:43,432
TO GET HIMSELF A BETTER GRIP

743
00:21:43,432 --> 00:21:44,367
WITH HIS GUMS AND THE HERRING

744
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:45,534
SWOOPED DOWN, PICKED THE TEETH

745
00:21:45,534 --> 00:21:48,237
UP AND FLEW OFF,

746
00:21:48,237 --> 00:21:49,005
AND GOLLY THERE IS NOTHING

747
00:21:49,005 --> 00:21:50,306
SO UNNERVING AS SEEING A

748
00:21:50,306 --> 00:21:51,741

>>HAROLD: YOU KNOW UNCLE RED

752
00:21:56,646 --> 00:21:57,713
I HEARD THAT OLD MAN SEDGEWICK

753
00:21:57,713 --> 00:21:58,681
CAME TO HIS SENSES AND HE'S

754
00:21:58,681 --> 00:21:59,615
COMPLETELY ABANDONED

755
00:21:59,615 --> 00:22:00,816
THIS NEST IDEA.

756
00:22:00,816 --> 00:22:01,784
>>RED: WELL YOU'RE HALF RIGHT,

757

HE ABANDONED THE IDEA

758
00:22:02,785 --> 00:22:04,053
BUT HE'S GOING TO BUILD HIMSELF

759
00:22:04,053 --> 00:22:05,087
A WHOLE NEW DIFFERENT

760
00:22:05,087 --> 00:22:06,255
TYPE OF HOME.

761
00:22:06,255 --> 00:22:07,223
IT'S GOING TO BE ALL SEASON,

BUILD A GREAT BIG BEEHIVE.

766
00:22:19,502 --> 00:22:20,302

00:22:20,302 --> 00:22:22,004
THAT SURPRISE ME?

768

>>RED: AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK

769
00:22:23,005 --> 00:22:23,973
OUT HE'S GOING TO GET 90 MILES

OF YARN AND SPIN A COCOON,

771
