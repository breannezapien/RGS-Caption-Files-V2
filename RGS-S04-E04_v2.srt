IS THAT MEN WILL

THEIR KIDS' REPORT CARD,

EVERYTHING INTO

WOW, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL,

HAPPENED TO JUNIOR

OFFERED HIM 200

THAT THING FOR?

THROWING THE WOOD

THEY HAD TWO
PHONES IN THERE.

00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,542
WHY WOULD YOU HAVE
TWO PHONES IN YOUR
CAR, HAROLD?

44
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,144
WELL, ONE MIGHT
BE A FAX LINE.

45

OF COURSE, YOU
KNOW, HE MIGHT HAVE
TWO LINES AND ONE PHONE,

YOU KNOW, THAT
WAY YOU COULD TALK

OH, AND YOU
KNOW WHAT ELSE?

00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,119

OH, CONFERENCE CALLING,

NEED ANY FRIENDS, RIGHT?

THAT YOURSELF, HAROLD.

HECK OF A MESS

89

AND TEACH YOU ALL
HOW TO SPLIT LOGS.

138

OKAY.
FIRST THING
YOU WANT TO DO

139
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:32,665
IS STAND THE LOG UP
STRAIGHT ON A FLAT
SURFACE THERE.

140
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,133
AND OF COURSE
YOU WANT TO CLEAR

141
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:37,036
ALL THE STUFF OUT
OF THE WAY THAT'S
AROUND THE THING.

142
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:40,439
YOU TAKE A FULL
SWING WITH AN AXE

143
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:43,842
AND COME DOWN ON
SOMETHING LIKE A VICE

144

STAND UP SO FAR ON
THE BACK OF YOUR NECK

WOOL ON IT.

146
00:05:47,946 --> 00:05:50,616
ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE ALL
SET TO GO HERE.

147
00:05:54,553 --> 00:05:55,788
ALL RIGHT.

148
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,055
NOW, YOU ALWAYS
WANT TO MAKE SURE

149
00:05:57,055 --> 00:05:59,391
THAT THE AREA
BEHIND YOU IS
CLEARED OUT AS WELL.

150
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:07,833
YEAH, WE'RE FINE.

151
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,302
ALL RIGHT, LET'S
TRY THAT AGAIN.

152
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:13,639
OKAY.

153
00:06:20,245 --> 00:06:21,780
ALL RIGHT.

154
00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:28,620
SO THAT'S THE WAY
YOU WANT TO PLAY IT, HUH?

155
00:06:35,327 --> 00:06:37,362
THERE'S ACTUALLY A
SAFER AND MORE UPSCALE WAY

156
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:39,865
TO SPLIT FIREWOOD AND
THAT IS TO TAKE
SOMETHING HERE

157
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:43,569
WHICH IS CALLED A WEDGE
FROM THE LATIN WORD WEDGY,

158
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,038
WHICH MEANS TO
SPLIT OR RENT ASUNDER.

159
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:50,809
SO YOU JUST GET THAT
STARTED INTO THE LOG.

160
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:54,046
ALL RIGHT.

161
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,847
WHAT'S HAPPENED THERE
IS THAT SOMEHOW MY THUMB

162
00:06:55,847 --> 00:06:58,083
MANAGED TO GET IN BETWEEN
THE HAMMER AND THE WEDGE,

163
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,619
WHICH IS ACTUALLY NOT
A GOOD PLACE FOR
A THUMB TO BE.

164
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:02,254
ONE OF THE SIGNS
OF A TRUE HANDYMAN

165
00:07:02,254 --> 00:07:04,423
IS HIS ABILITY TO
CONTROL HIS TEMPER.

166
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:08,794
RIGHT NOW I'M FEELING
PRETTY DARN PROUD
OF MYSELF.

167
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:13,665
MIND YOU, THERE'S
ALWAYS ROOM FOR
IMPROVEMENT.

168
00:07:13,665 --> 00:07:15,467
Red Green:
COMING UP WE GOT
BILL OUT IN THE WOODS

169
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:17,202
MAKING SOME KIND
OF TROUBLE

170
00:07:17,202 --> 00:07:20,939
AND RANGER GORD HAS
GOT A BRAND NEW GAME.

171
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:27,779
WELL, OPERATION FIREWOOD
IS OFF TO A FLYING START.

172
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:31,683
GOT ALL THE
AXES SHARPENED UP

173
00:07:31,683 --> 00:07:33,618
AND WE'RE GOING
THROUGH CHAINSAW GAS

174
00:07:33,618 --> 00:07:36,288
LIKE THE
RECESSION IS OVER.

175
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:38,724
WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE
BEING RESPECTFUL OF
THE ENVIRONMENT

176
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,592
AND CUTTING DOWN TREES
THAT ONLY NEED TO
BE REMOVED

177
00:07:40,592 --> 00:07:44,096
DUE TO DISEASE AND
DEATH AND THE PROPER
THINNING OF A FOREST.

178
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:46,498
WELL, WE'RE USING THE
HUNDRED TO ONE
RATIO, HAROLD,

179
00:07:46,498 --> 00:07:49,334
FOR EVERY HUNDRED OAK TREES,
WE ONLY CUT DOWN ONE.

180
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:52,537
I ONLY WISH I HAD
A HUNDRED NEPHEWS.

181
00:07:53,772 --> 00:07:55,841
WELL, LET'S NOT FORGET
OUR SAFETY PRECAUTIONS,
UNCLE RED,

182
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:57,809
STEEL-TOED BOOTS,
PROTECTIVE EYEWEAR

183
00:07:57,809 --> 00:07:59,845
AND TYING OFF THE TREES
SO THEY FALL CORRECTLY.

184
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:03,815
TOO MUCH WORK, HAROLD.

185
00:08:03,815 --> 00:08:06,785
SO WE STAND
70 FEET APART.

186
00:08:06,785 --> 00:08:08,119
THAT WAY EVERY MAN
GETS HIS OWN TREE,

187
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:10,021
YOU DON'T HAVE SOME
GOOF COMING IN AT
HE LAST MINUTE

188
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:11,122
AND FINISHING HER OFF

189
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:13,458
WHEN YOU DID ALL
THE WORK TO GET
HER THAT CLOSE.

190
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,093
WELL, HOW MANY TREES
DO YOU PLAN TO ASSAULT?

191
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:17,429
50 A DAY, EVERY
DAY, DAY AFTER DAY

192
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:19,931
UNTIL WE'RE TOO
TIRED TO DO ANYMORE.

193
00:08:19,931 --> 00:08:24,536
WOW, THAT WILL GIVE
YOU A GRAND TOTAL OF 50.

194
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:27,839
YOU ROLLING
THERE, HAROLD?

195
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,242
ALL RIGHT,
WE'RE HERE WITH OUR
FRIEND RANGER GORD.

196
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:32,077
HI RED.
HI HAROLD.

197
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:33,011
YEAH, HI THERE, GORD.

198
00:08:33,011 --> 00:08:34,446
GORD, WE'RE GETTING
KIND OF BOGGED DOWN

199
00:08:34,446 --> 00:08:36,014
WITH THE FIREWOOD
PROJECT THERE.

200
00:08:36,014 --> 00:08:37,215
I WONDER IF YOU
COULD DO US A FAVOUR,

201
00:08:37,215 --> 00:08:38,583
GO OUT INTO THE WOODS
AND MAKE A LITTLE X

202
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,285
ON ALL THE TREES THAT
ARE EASY TO CUT DOWN.

203
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:41,686
COULD YOU DO THAT?

204
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:43,088
WELL, THAT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU NEED TO KNOW

205
00:08:43,088 --> 00:08:44,522
MORE ABOUT THE FLORA.

206
00:08:44,522 --> 00:08:45,690
OH, NO, NO,
I KNOW FLORA.

207
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,525
EVERYBODY KNOWS
FLORA, RIGHT GLEN?

208
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:53,198
NO, I MEAN THE
FLORA IN THE WOODS.

209
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:54,899
AND YOU CAN
LEARN ALL ABOUT
THE FLORA IN THE WOODS

210
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:57,068
BY PLAYING THIS
GAME I INVENTED.

211
00:08:57,068 --> 00:08:59,137
IT'S CALLED GRABITAT.

212
00:08:59,137 --> 00:09:00,238
DO YOU GET IT?

213
00:09:00,238 --> 00:09:01,806
GRABITAT BECAUSE
YOU REACH IN

214
00:09:01,806 --> 00:09:03,842
AND YOU GRAB SOMETHING
FROM YOUR HABITAT.

215
00:09:03,842 --> 00:09:05,844
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY
SOME DUMB GAME, GORD.

216
00:09:05,844 --> 00:09:08,246
I WANT TO GO
CUT DOWN TREES.

217
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:10,949
PLAY ONE GAME
AND I'LL MARK
10 TREES FOR YOU.

218
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:12,350
DEAL.

219
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,519
GRABITAT IS FUN,
YOU JUST REACH IN AND
YOU PULL SOMETHING OUT,

220
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,756
AND IF YOU CAN IDENTIFY
IT, IT'S WORTH 5 POINTS.

221
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:19,858
OKAY, THAT'S PINE.
5 POINTS FOR ME.

222
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:21,826
YOUR TURN, RED.

223
00:09:21,826 --> 00:09:23,628
ALL RIGHT.

224
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:25,997
LET'S SEE WHAT
YOU GOT IN HERE.

225
00:09:25,997 --> 00:09:28,166
THERE WE GO.

226
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:32,737
IT'S I GUESS THAT
WOULD BE A STICK, RIGHT?

227
00:09:32,737 --> 00:09:34,839
YOU GOT THE DOGWOOD.

228
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,341
WHAT'S SO FUNNY
ABOUT DOGWOOD?

229
00:09:36,341 --> 00:09:38,410
SMELL IT.

230
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:42,914
OH, THAT'S FUNNY.

231
00:09:42,914 --> 00:09:45,016
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE YOU
WANT YOUR GAME
TO BE FUNNY

232
00:09:45,016 --> 00:09:46,985
IF YOU WANT IT
TO BE POPULAR.

233
00:09:46,985 --> 00:09:48,219
YOU KNOW, I THINK
THIS IS GOING TO BE

234
00:09:48,219 --> 00:09:49,487
A GREAT HIT
WITH THE KIDS

235
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:51,256
BECAUSE THEY CAN LEARN
ALL ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT.

236
00:09:51,256 --> 00:09:54,959
I'M GOING TO SELL
IT AT ALL THOSE STORES
THAT SELL BIRTH SHOES.

237
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:01,466
OKAY, JUST A MINUTE.

238
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:03,434
THAT'S SUMAC.
5 POINTS FOR ME.

239
00:10:03,434 --> 00:10:08,006
YOUR TURN, RED.
NO PROBLEM.

240
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:10,441
OH, NO, I
KNOW THIS ONE.

241
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:12,777
THAT'S MINT.
NO, IT'S NOT.

242
00:10:12,777 --> 00:10:19,317
I'VE SEEN
THAT LEAF BEFORE.

243
00:10:19,317 --> 00:10:20,919
ALL RIGHT, YOU
GOT ME, WHAT IS IT?

244
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:23,488
POISON IVY.

245
00:10:24,556 --> 00:10:26,457
THIS IS THE HOME
RENOVATION FEATURE

246
00:10:26,457 --> 00:10:29,427
WHERE WE SHOW
YOU HOW TO MAKE
YOUR HOUSE MORE HOMELY.

247
00:10:29,427 --> 00:10:31,195
AND THIS HERE
OF COURSE IS MIKE.

248
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:33,131
MIKE HELPS US OUT
WITH THESE PARTS
OF THE SHOW.

249
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:34,866
WELL, MR. GREEN, HE
SURE HELPED ME OUT.

250
00:10:34,866 --> 00:10:36,968
HE JUST SAVED
MY LIFE IS ALL.

251
00:10:36,968 --> 00:10:38,536
MIKE IS WITH
THE, YOU KNOW,

252
00:10:38,536 --> 00:10:40,571
ONE OF THE PRISONER
REHAB DEAL THINGS.

253
00:10:40,571 --> 00:10:42,140
THIS MAN IS A SAINT.

254
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,375
THAT'S ALL I'M
GOING TO SAY ABOUT IT.

255
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,576
OKAY.

256
00:10:45,576 --> 00:10:48,646
WE'RE GOING TO SHOW
YOU A GREAT WAY TO
INSULATE YOUR HOME.

257
00:10:48,646 --> 00:10:49,881
YEAH, THAT'S IT, MIKE.

258
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:52,116
YOU HEAR ABOUT
VERMICULITE IN THE FOAM

259
00:10:52,116 --> 00:10:53,751
AND THE FIBERGLASS
AND SO ON.

260
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:56,721
WHAT WE LIKE IS THE
INDUSTRIAL GRADE POPCORN.

261
00:10:56,721 --> 00:10:59,257
IT'S GOT A HIGH
R-FACTOR, YOU KNOW.

262
00:10:59,257 --> 00:11:01,459
LOW IN CHOLESTEROL.
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

263
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:03,728
AND ALL YOU HAVE TO
DO IS USE THE HEATING
SYSTEM IN YOUR HOUSE

264
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:05,797
TO BLOW -- NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO --

265
00:11:05,797 --> 00:11:07,932
TO BLOW THIS STUFF UP
INTO THE EXTERIOR WALLS.

266
00:11:07,932 --> 00:11:10,601
SO THE FIRST STEP
IS TO TAKE THE END
PANEL OFF YOUR FURNACE.

267
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:12,336
YEAH.

268
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:14,806
HERE, I WILL SHOW
YOU HOW IT'S DONE.

269
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:21,713
SEE I'M LEARNING, EH?

270
00:11:21,713 --> 00:11:25,383
I SAID THE
END PANEL HERE.

271
00:11:26,818 --> 00:11:29,454
OH, I CAN'T
BELIEVE IT.

272
00:11:29,454 --> 00:11:30,655
I'M SORRY.

273
00:11:30,655 --> 00:11:32,223
NO. NO.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

274
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,558
I DON'T KNOW HOW I
WILL GET THIS BACK ON.

275
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:35,426
NO PROBLEM.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

276
00:11:35,426 --> 00:11:36,861
NOW, WHAT YOU WANT TO
DO TO TURN YOUR FURNACE

277
00:11:36,861 --> 00:11:38,429
INTO A HOT AIR
POPCORN POPPER,

278
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:40,331
YOU GOT TO TAKE A WAD OF
THE HANDYMAN SECRET WEAPON,

279
00:11:40,331 --> 00:11:43,234
DUCT TAPE, AND YOU WANT
TO JUST BALL THAT UP

280
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:46,337
AROUND THE FAN BELT
THERE SO THAT WHEN
SHE GETS GOING,

281
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:48,372
SHE'LL VIBRATE
UP ON YOU

282
00:11:48,372 --> 00:11:52,910
AND THAT WAY THE
KERNELS WON'T BURN TOO
BAD IN THE HEATING CHAMBER.

283
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:59,450
I'LL GET IT.
IT'S STICKY.

284
00:12:00,117 --> 00:12:01,619
YOU ALL RIGHT?

285
00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:05,089
IT KEEPS
STICKING TO ITSELF.

286
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:06,924
MAYBE WE'LL
JUST USE SOME ROPE.

287
00:12:06,924 --> 00:12:08,893
HERE YOU PULL.

288
00:12:08,893 --> 00:12:12,029
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.

289
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:19,503
WHY DON'T I COME
THROUGH THIS WAY?

290
00:12:19,503 --> 00:12:21,572
I THINK IF YOU CAME
AROUND THE OTHER WAY --

291
00:12:21,572 --> 00:12:24,709
ALL RIGHT.

292
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:28,379
THIS IS WORKING
AGAINST ME SOMEHOW.

293
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:33,517
HOW MUCH DUCT
TAPE HAVE WE GOT?

294
00:12:33,517 --> 00:12:36,821
TWO MORE DUCTS.

295
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:40,825
THIS WILL ALL MAKE
SENSE AT A LATER
DATE, I PROMISE.

296
00:12:42,226 --> 00:12:43,828
ALL RIGHT, NOW THE
POPCORN IS GOING TO POP

297
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:45,162
THROUGH ALL
THE FLOOR VENTS,

298
00:12:45,162 --> 00:12:47,198
SO YOU WANT TO TAKE
THE COVERS OFF --

299
00:12:48,632 --> 00:12:50,134
Mike:
THAT'S ALL OF THEM.
OH SORRY.

300
00:12:50,134 --> 00:12:52,269
OH GEEZ.
YOU OKAY?

301
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:54,138
YEAH.
I'M FINE, THANKS.

302
00:12:54,138 --> 00:12:55,473
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO

303
00:12:55,473 --> 00:12:57,008
IS CUT A HOLE IN THE
WALL ABOUT 8 INCHES
ABOVE THE FLOOR

304
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:58,342
AND LINE THESE TWO
RIGHT UP SO THAT

305
00:12:58,342 --> 00:13:00,011
THE POPCORN CAN
CONTINUE RIGHT ON UP

306
00:13:00,011 --> 00:13:01,812
AND GO UP AND FILL
UP YOUR EXTERIOR WALL.

307
00:13:01,812 --> 00:13:03,981
SO WHAT YOU NEED
IS A LITTLE BIT OF
TEMPORARY DUCT WORK.

308
00:13:03,981 --> 00:13:06,250
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU CAN USE IS
A BOOT BOX LIKE THIS,

309
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,752
CUT THE ENDS OUT OF IT,

310
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:11,021
AND THEN IT'S LONG ENOUGH
TO JOIN UP THE TWO HOLES.

311
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:13,224
YOU SHOULD CUT
THE ENDS OFF.

312
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:14,925
I CUT THE SIDES OFF.

313
00:13:14,925 --> 00:13:17,061
YEAH, THAT'S...

314
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:18,696
KIND OF SHORT.

315
00:13:18,696 --> 00:13:22,433
YEAH.

316
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:25,536
I'M USELESS.

317
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:27,905
I'M JUST USELESS.

318
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:30,107
WELL, WE'LL COME BACK
A LITTLE LATER IN THE SHOW

319
00:13:30,107 --> 00:13:31,442
AND WE'LL GET
HER ALL RIGGED UP.

320
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:32,877
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

321
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:35,212
Mike:
I'M USELESS!

322
00:13:35,212 --> 00:13:37,648
Red Green:
TIME FOR
ADVENTURES WITH BILL

323
00:13:37,648 --> 00:13:39,316
OUT IN THE WOODS,
WHERE ELSE?

324
00:13:39,316 --> 00:13:41,652
WHERE ARE YOU BILL?
WHERE ARE YOU?

325
00:13:41,652 --> 00:13:44,021
HE'S AROUND SOMEWHERE.
YEAH, THERE HE IS.

326
00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:46,557
WELL, LOOK AT
ALL THOSE AXES.

327
00:13:46,557 --> 00:13:48,859
WITH THE PICK YOUR OWN
FIREWOOD PROJECT AND SO ON,

328
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:51,195
BILL DECIDED HE WAS
GOING TO KIND OF SHOW US

329
00:13:51,195 --> 00:13:53,430
HOW TO DO THINGS
AND CUT STUFF UP

330
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:57,234
AND I GUESS HOW
TO THROW AN AXE

331
00:13:57,234 --> 00:13:59,103
FROM ONE END OF THE
WOODS TO THE OTHER.

332
00:13:59,103 --> 00:14:01,372
OKAY, BILL,
WE'VE SEEN THAT.

333
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:03,607
THE OTHER AXE IS...

334
00:14:03,607 --> 00:14:06,243
YEAH.
YEAH.

335
00:14:06,243 --> 00:14:08,546
BILL DOESN'T GET A LOT
DONE IN A DAY, I GUESS,

336
00:14:08,546 --> 00:14:10,447
WHEN HE'S WORKING
IN THE LUMBER --

337
00:14:10,447 --> 00:14:12,016
HE'S KIND OF A
LUMBERING GUY,

338
00:14:12,016 --> 00:14:13,417
YOU'D THINK THAT HE --

339
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,786
ANYWAY, YOU GOT
THE OTHER AXE?

340
00:14:15,786 --> 00:14:18,689
BILL, WHAT ABOUT
THE OTHER AXES?

341
00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:21,525
YEAH, GOOD IDEA.
GOOD IDEA, BILL.

342
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:24,828
SO WE GOT THE OTHER
AXES AND OUT WE GO.

343
00:14:24,828 --> 00:14:27,564
AND I WONDER WHERE
THE OTHER ONE WENT ANYWAY.

344
00:14:27,564 --> 00:14:28,666
WHO KNOWS.

345
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,034
OH, THERE IT IS.
THERE IT IS.

346
00:14:30,034 --> 00:14:31,835
OH, THAT'S HANDY.

347
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:33,804
NOW, THE THING ABOUT
DOING WORK LIKE CUTTING
UP LOGS AND EVERYTHING,

348
00:14:33,804 --> 00:14:35,139
YOU GOT TO
MAKE IT FUN.

349
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:36,640
THAT'S THE TRICK OF IT.

350
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,575
YOU GOT TO, YOU KNOW --
THERE WE GO.

351
00:14:38,575 --> 00:14:40,344
AND YOU TURN IT
INTO A SPORT.

352
00:14:40,344 --> 00:14:42,112
I THINK IT WAS MARY
POPPINS WHO SAID, YOU KNOW,

353
00:14:42,112 --> 00:14:44,214
JUST A SPOON FULL
OF SWINGING AN AXE

354
00:14:44,214 --> 00:14:46,183
MAKES YOUR LEG GO DOWN
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

355
00:14:46,183 --> 00:14:47,384
I FORGET.

356
00:14:47,384 --> 00:14:49,119
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T
WE JUST CHOP UP THE LOG.

357
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:50,921
GET RIGHT UP.
OH. OH.

358
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:52,423
GET RIGHT UP THERE
ON TOP OF IT,

359
00:14:52,423 --> 00:14:55,025
YOU KNOW, AND YOU CAN
SING ONE OF THOSE
LUMBERJACK TUNES

360
00:14:55,025 --> 00:14:57,361
AND JUST KIND OF GET
YOURSELF INTO A REAL BIG --

361
00:14:57,361 --> 00:14:59,596
BOY, THAT IS BIG FUN.

362
00:14:59,596 --> 00:15:01,532
ALL RIGHT.

363
00:15:01,532 --> 00:15:03,300
SOME PARTS OF IT MAYBE
AREN'T AS ENJOYABLE

364
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,868
AS SOME OF THE OTHERS.

365
00:15:04,868 --> 00:15:06,303
I'M SURE HE'S FINE.

366
00:15:06,303 --> 00:15:08,305
APPARENTLY YOU DON'T
NEED ALL YOUR TOES.

367
00:15:08,305 --> 00:15:10,307
AND BILL IS
CUTTING THAT UP.

368
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:12,843
AND, YOU KNOW, I TELL
YOU IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.

369
00:15:12,843 --> 00:15:14,878
YOU GET IN TERRIFIC
CONDITION I WOULD THINK

370
00:15:14,878 --> 00:15:17,214
IF YOU DID THIS ON
A REGULAR BASIS.

371
00:15:17,214 --> 00:15:18,549
WE'RE HACKING AWAY,

372
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:20,250
HAVING A GOOD
TIME, FEELING GOOD.

373
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,720
I DON'T THINK WE'VE
HAD THIS MUCH FUN IN
THE WOODS SINCE THE FIRE.

374
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,289
THERE WE GO.
THERE WE GO.

375
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:26,690
THERE'S THE SECRET.

376
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,859
YEAH.
THAT'S PROGRESS.

377
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:30,661
AND BILL CUTS IT
RIGHT DOWN THERE.

378
00:15:30,661 --> 00:15:32,996
AND HE DIDN'T FEEL
GOOD ABOUT CUTTING
HER ALL THE WAY THROUGH

379
00:15:32,996 --> 00:15:34,932
BECAUSE IT WAS HIS
OWN CHAINSAW,

380
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:37,334
SO HE THOUGHT WHAT HE'D
DO IS JUST FINISH HER
OFF WITH AN AXE.

381
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:38,635
KIND OF A PURIST BILL IS.

382
00:15:38,635 --> 00:15:41,538
UNFORTUNATELY, SHE
WEDGED RIGHT IN THERE.

383
00:15:41,538 --> 00:15:43,440
CAN'T GETG HER OUT.
NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

384
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,742
WE'RE RUNNING
SHORT ON AXES HERE.

385
00:15:45,742 --> 00:15:47,077
SO BILL'S GOT AN IDEA.

386
00:15:47,077 --> 00:15:49,513
HE FIGURES IF WE
EACH GET ON EACH
END OF THE LOG

387
00:15:49,513 --> 00:15:51,081
AND START BOUNCING,
YOU KNOW,

388
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:52,649
WITH THE WEIGHT AND SO
ON IT WILL BE ABLE

389
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:54,184
TO SPRING THAT AXE
RIGHT OUT OF THERE.

390
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:55,819
IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE
THAT WOULD WORK TO ME.

391
00:15:55,819 --> 00:15:59,289
BUT I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE
THINKING OF ANYTHING
ELSE SO AWAY WE GO

392
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:01,358
AND IT CERTAINLY SPLIT --

393
00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:03,293
OH, YEAH, THERE WE GO.
IT'S WORKING.

394
00:16:03,293 --> 00:16:05,095
WHAT ABOUT THE AXE THOUGH?
DID THE AXE COME OUT?

395
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:09,132
YES, IT DID.
THERE WE GO.

396
00:16:12,336 --> 00:16:14,338
Red Green:
COMING UP WE
GOT WINSTON ROTHSCHILD,

397
00:16:14,338 --> 00:16:15,772
KING OF THE HOSERS,

398
00:16:15,772 --> 00:16:18,241
AND, DON'T WORRY,
WE GOT THE POPCORN
INSULATION PROJECT

399
00:16:18,241 --> 00:16:20,043
TOTALLY UNDER CONTROL.

400
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:23,747
WELL, THERE DOESN'T
SEEM TO BE AN EASY WAY

401
00:16:23,747 --> 00:16:25,649
TO TURN TREES
INTO FIREWOOD.

402
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:27,985
OUR WINDOW
OF OPPORTUNITY
IS CLOSING FAST.

403
00:16:27,985 --> 00:16:30,120
CARPE DIEM, UNCLE RED.

404
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,588
WHAT?

405
00:16:31,588 --> 00:16:33,957
CARPE DIEM.

406
00:16:33,957 --> 00:16:35,959
SEIZE THE DAY.

407
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:39,062
YOU'RE CLOSE, HAROLD,
I SEIZE THE CHAINSAW.

408
00:16:39,062 --> 00:16:40,864
I THINK WE'RE GOING
AT THIS ALL WRONG.

409
00:16:40,864 --> 00:16:42,899
I THINK THE PROFIT
IS IN SELLING THE
RAW MATERIALS,

410
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,168
NOT IN MARKING UP
THE LABOUR COSTS.

411
00:16:45,168 --> 00:16:48,405
I'VE NEVER HEARD YOU
SPEAK IN BUSINESS
TERMS BEFORE.

412
00:16:48,405 --> 00:16:50,640
WELL, WE DON'T
HAVE A BUSINESS
RELATIONSHIP, HAROLD.

413
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,743
WITH YOU IT'S PERSONAL.

414
00:16:52,743 --> 00:16:54,244
THANK YOU.

415
00:16:54,244 --> 00:16:55,812
SO I'M GOING
TO PLAN B.

416
00:16:55,812 --> 00:16:57,180
HAROLD, TELL ME THIS.

417
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,549
WHAT DO PEOPLE FROM
THE CITY LIKE
TO DO MOST?

418
00:16:59,549 --> 00:17:01,818
DRIVE SILVER
COLOURED GERMAN CARS.

419
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:03,754
NO, I KNOW,
I KNOW THIS ONE.

420
00:17:03,754 --> 00:17:06,256
IT'S PAY TOO MUCH
MONEY FOR CLOTHES.

421
00:17:06,256 --> 00:17:08,091
NO, I KNOW WHAT IT IS,
I KNOW WHAT IT IS,

422
00:17:08,091 --> 00:17:09,726
BUY MUTUAL FUNDS.

423
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:12,195
OKAY, I DON'T KNOW.

424
00:17:12,195 --> 00:17:14,164
PICK YOUR OWN
STRAWBERRIES, HAROLD.

425
00:17:14,164 --> 00:17:15,799
NO, NO, NO, HAROLD.

426
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:18,368
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE FROM
THE CITY LIKE TO DO.

427
00:17:18,368 --> 00:17:20,170
PICK STRAWBERRIES?

428
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,805
NOT THE STRAWBERRIES,
THE PICKING.

429
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:23,640
THEY LIKE COMING UP HERE
PRETENDING THEY'RE FARMERS.

430
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,542
PICK YOUR OWN PEACHES,
PICK YOUR OWN APPLES.

431
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:27,644
WHY NOT PICK
YOUR OWN FIREWOOD?

432
00:17:27,644 --> 00:17:30,347
YOU'RE GOING
TO GIVE THEM A
PRETTY BIG BASKET.

433
00:17:30,347 --> 00:17:32,682
NO, NO, NO, YOU JUST
TAKE THE 300 BUCKS,

434
00:17:32,682 --> 00:17:33,950
HAND THEM AN AXE,

435
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,318
GET THEM TO SIGN
AN INJURY WAIVER

436
00:17:35,318 --> 00:17:37,053
AND POINT THEM
AT A TREE.

437
00:17:37,053 --> 00:17:38,955
A LOT OF PEOPLE GOING
HOME WITHOUT FIREWOOD

438
00:17:38,955 --> 00:17:40,557
OR FINGERS.

439
00:17:40,557 --> 00:17:41,892
I DON'T THINK
THAT MATTERS, HAROLD.

440
00:17:41,892 --> 00:17:43,527
I THINK SOME OF THESE
GUYS WOULD PAY 300 BUCKS

441
00:17:43,527 --> 00:17:45,996
JUST TO WAIL AWAY
AT A PINE FOR AN HOUR.

442
00:17:45,996 --> 00:17:47,497
THEY DON'T GET A CHANCE
TO COMMUNE WITH NATURE

443
00:17:47,497 --> 00:17:48,999
STUCK UP THERE IN
A GLASS TOWER,

444
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:50,133
BEHIND A STEEL DESK,

445
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:52,168
PLAYING WITH A PLASTIC
COMPUTER THERE.

446
00:17:52,168 --> 00:17:54,170
SO WHAT YOU'RE SELLING,
THEN, IS STRESS RELIEF.

447
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,338
THAT'S RIGHT.

448
00:17:55,338 --> 00:18:01,845
WHERE ELSE CAN YOU BUY
THERAPY BY THE CORD?

449
00:18:01,845 --> 00:18:05,181
IF MY DAUGHTER IS
WATCHING THIS SHOW,

450
00:18:05,181 --> 00:18:08,285
YOUR MOTHER AND I WOULD
LIKE YOU TO COME BACK.

451
00:18:08,285 --> 00:18:11,054
DID YOU KNOW YOU
TOOK MY CREDIT CARD?

452
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:14,624
OKAY, WE'RE BACK
WITH THIS WEEK'S
HOME RENOVATION PROJECT,

453
00:18:14,624 --> 00:18:17,661
HOW TO INSULATE YOUR
HOUSE USING POPCORN.

454
00:18:17,661 --> 00:18:20,096
NOW ALL THE VENTS
NEAR THE EXTERIOR WALLS
