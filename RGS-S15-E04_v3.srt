1
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:05,472
Here’s a great idea for anyone
who lives in a small house.

2
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:08,108
It's a little
something I call

3
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:10,110
my spacesaver table.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,379
First thing you do is attach
one edge of the table

5
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:14,748
to the wall
with a piano hinge.

6
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,950
Now, you can take a hinge
right off a piano,

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,752
but be sure you tell
the pianist first

8
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:20,453
or somebody could
lose a finger.

9
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:22,889
Next thing you want to do
is remove all the table legs

10
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:24,924
with either a screwdriver

11
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:26,860
or a fat person
falling over it.

12
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,295
Then you replace the
front legs with these
toilet plungers

13
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:32,899
and mount them right
up through the table
as I've done here.

14
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:35,902
And just like my own legs,
they're not only decorative,

15
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:38,671
they're also
fully functional

16
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:41,074
as coasters...

17
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,743
and as snack bowls.

18
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:51,151
But here's the best part
when you finish dinner

19
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,553
and you need room to
square dance or
gut a moose,

20
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,488
you can easily get
the table out of the way.

21
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:58,291
And in keeping with my
bathroom plunger motif,

22
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,828
I'm using toilet paper holders
as my handles.

is congratulations.

Congratulations,

00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,194
I bought the motel
for 800 bucks, Harold.

55
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:42,962
800 bucks for
the entire motel,

lock, stock
and towels.

They can't, they're
stuck to the rack.

59

Why do you want
to buy a motel?

60
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,409
800 bucks for a motel!

61
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,778
I mean, the land value
alone's got to be
50 grand.

That's called
business savvy,
Harold.

63
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,415
Yes, yes.

64
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,384
But you didn't buy the land,
just the motel.

65
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,818
What?
Yup.

66
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:08,321
Excluding all lands.

67
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,857
And it says you got 24 hours
to get rid of the motel

68
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,093
because the land owners
are actually going to build
a new resort.

69
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,198
So instead of them having
to pay thousands of dollars

70
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,600
to have the motel torn down,
they got you to do it for free

71
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:26,072
and you paid them
800 dollars to do it.

back when I was a kid,

139

long family car trips
were never a problem

140

Parents today give their kids

and constant support.

on Handyman Corner,

how you can enjoy

00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,402
a pleasant family car trip
without reverting back

149

to the pattern
of parental discipline

and behavioral standards
that were apparently

ruining all
of our lives.

152
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,977
Okay, the first step in
giving kids their own space

153
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:27,980
is to divide up the space
so you can still have yours.

for something stronger.

around the same time

00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,490
Bill is so talented
that he can actually

316
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,826
put the plane together
without all the parts
which I find...

317
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:31,664
Now, he's looking at Winston
and that's too much work

318
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,165
winding up that elastic

319
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:34,800
so he's thinking,
wait a second,

320
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,635
is there some way
that I can do

321
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,437
a bit of a
shortcut here?

322
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,472
He gets an idea, why doesn't he
take Winston's work

323
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:44,476
and kind of borrow it
for a minute

324
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,546
and he hands it
back to Winston.

325
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,647
You can keep winding,
Winston.

326
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,349
Meanwhile, Bill's plane
is ready to go

327
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,951
so he fires it up there.

328
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,652
And the thing with
those planes is

329
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,187
they set the tail
on a bit of an angle

330
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:56,822
so they'll do
a big circle around,

331
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,157
and Bill probably
should have thought that...

332
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,892
Oh!

333
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,664
And unfortunately, Winston,
in his pain jumped up and down

334
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,367
on Bill's
airplane and so...

335
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,602
and Witon had let his
plane go and it was
going in a circle

336
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:14,273
the other way,
and you know, you wanna --

337
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:15,407
the heck with it...

338
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:16,775
Oh!

339
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,711
And it kind of jammed
right in there.

340
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,815
My golly.

341
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,750
Whoa!

342
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,987
That's two minutes
for slashing, right there.

343
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,656
So now they've got no planes
so Bill's got an idea.

344
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,225
He's got the kayak and he's got
the paddles and he thinks,

345
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:36,161
"Wait a sec., maybe we can
take this up a notch."

346
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:40,632
And they had found a small
tricycle they're using
as the landing gear

347
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,101
And now they just need
an elastic --

348
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:46,038
Oh, there's your elastic,
kind of like a wet suit --
a rubber deal.

349
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,007
And he takes
that onto the prop.,

350
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,942
and then Bill hooks
her on to the --

351
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,076
oh, boy!

352
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,779
All right, I don't know
about this.

353
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,614
So Bill gets in,

354
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:59,018
and I'm thinking you know,
you still don't have
any wings do you?

355
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,652
No, there's no wings.

356
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:01,854
Bill, there's no wings.

357
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,022
Bill... no wings.

358
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,323
Oh no, you're good.

359
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,491
You're good.

360
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:06,792
Okay, all right.

361
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:10,129
So Winston's wind -- really
putting the tension on there

362
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,031
and getting her done...

363
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,366
Okay, he's going
to let her go,

364
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,869
but he had wound it
the wrong way

365
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,838
which was unfortunate.

366
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:28,947
You know, it's human nature
to remember things

367
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:30,816
as being better
than they were,

368
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,552
like say,
your dating years

369
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,921
or this old jukebox.

370
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:39,091
Oh sure, it was kind of neat
to see the arm swing over,

371
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,160
pick up the record
and then swing across

372
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,828
so that the machine
could play it

373
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,830
and then put it away
when it was done.

374
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,332
Something you could never get
your kids to do.

375
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,101
But the problem was that all
the records everybody liked

376
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,670
got played to much
they got all scratchy.

377
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,806
The only ones that
sounded good were like,

378
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,575
The Hanky Panky
by Jim Nabors.

379
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,777
So what do you do when
an old entertainment centre

380
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,979
stops being entertaining?

381
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,348
You do what Jim Nabors
couldn't do,

382
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,184

383
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:08,253
All it takes is
a little imagination

384
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,688
and a B.B. gun,

385
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:13,292
and I can change this unit
from a jukebox into
a video game.

386
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,060
Actually, you can change
a lot of things

and a B.B. gun,

394

Uhh, pretty much, yeah.

Oh yeah, pretty much.

You know,
I was hoping maybe
for a suggestion

400
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:19,158
maybe something like The Wreck
of the Edmund Fitzgerald?

401
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,227
Well, that's an
odd choice,
isn't it?

402
