1
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:04,304
LOTS OF GUYS TRY TO
MAKE CUT-OFF SHORTS

2
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:06,006
OUT OF THEIR
OLD WORK PANTS.

3
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:10,110
THE PROBLEM IS GETTING
THE LEGS THE SAME LENGTH.

4
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:12,445
SOMETIMES, YOUR TIN SNIPS
OR YOUR PRUNING SHEARS

5
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,781
JUST AREN'T SHARP ENOUGH
TO DO A GOOD, CLEAN JOB.

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,182
NOW, HERE'S AN IDEA.

7
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:17,884
JUST TAKE YOUR OLD PANTS

8
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:20,320
AND DUCT TAPE THEM TO
A PIECE OF SCRAP PLYWOOD.

9
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,522
LET THE TABLE SAW DO THE WORK.

10
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:28,528
[saw cutting]

11
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:32,332
[laughter and applause]

12
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,269
IT'S THE RED GREEN SHOW!!!

13
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:39,839
HERE'S THE MAN WHO'S FORGOTTEN
MORE THAN HE'LL EVER REMEMBER.

14
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:40,974
YOUR HOST, YOUR HERO,

15
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,242
BUT HE'S MY UNCLE:

16
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:44,277
RED GREEEEEN!!!

17
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:50,617
[applause]

18
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,725
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
APPRECIATE IT.

19
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,360
WELL, GUESS WHAT?

20
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:02,796
THE POSSUM VAN GOT TOWED AGAIN.

21
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:04,297
WHAT KIND OF WORLD IS THIS

22
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:08,568
WHERE YOU CAN'T EVEN DOUBLE
PARK IN YOUR OWN HOMETOWN?

23
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:11,504
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REMEMBER
TO TURN THE POSSUM VAN OFF.

24
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,274
YOUR EXHAUST FUMES
KILLED THAT FLORAL CLOCK.

25
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,309
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

26
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,678
NONE OF THE VEHICLES ARE EVER
GOING TO GET TOWED AGAIN.

27
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,013
LISTEN TO THIS.

28
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,681
THE TOWN COUNCIL HAS
PUT OUT TENDERS

29
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,217
AND POSSUM LODGE IS GOING TO
GO AFTER THE TOWING CONTRACT

30
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:25,952
'CAUSE WE PUT IN THE LOWEST BID.

31
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,253
WE'RE GOING TO GET 'ER.

32
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,757
YEAH.

33
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,659
YOU DON'T HAVE
A TOW TRUCK.

34
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:35,295
THAT'S WHY OUR
BID IS SO LOW.

35
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:39,999
WE GOT NO OVERHEAD.

36
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,435
YOU GOT NO INHEAD.

37
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:43,603
STOP IT.
WHAT?

38
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,844
IT'S TIME TO PLAY
"THE POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME."

39
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,547
AND TODAY'S GRAND PRIZE IS
A PAIR OF CHINESE FINGER CUFFS.

40
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:01,054
[laughter]

41
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,556
AND THEY WORK!

42
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:07,460
OUR SPECIAL GUEST
TODAY IS RANGER GORD.

43
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:11,764
[applause]

44
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:18,705
UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO GET RANGER GORD TO SAY
THE FOLLOWING WORD:

45
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,213
ALL RIGHT, HAROLD.

46
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,815
GO!!!

47
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,084
GORD, FILL IN THE BLANK.

48
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,386
YOU CAN'T SEE THE SOMETHING
FOR THE TREES.

49
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:34,554
THE BEAR.

50
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,856
NOT THE BEAR.

51
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,225
THE PULL-OUT COUCH?

52
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:42,595
YOU'RE ONE OF THESE, OKAY?

53
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,764
YOU ARE A BLANK RANGER.

54
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,334
[laughter]

55
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,170
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO INSULTED!

56
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:51,704
OH, OH...

57
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:52,705
...LONELY?

58
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,741
NO, NO.

59
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:57,544
UH... SEXY?
NO.

60
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,445
Harold:
YOU'RE ALMOST OUT
OF TIME, UNCLE RED.

61
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,115
A BUNCH OF TREES.

62
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,483
A FLOCK.

63
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,853
YOU'RE THINKING BIRDS.

64
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,821
A QUIVER.

65
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:09,822
A GAGGLE.

66
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,624
TREES TRAVEL IN GAGGLES.

67
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,993
GORD...

68
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,095
TREES DON'T TRAVEL IN ANYTHING.

69
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:19,666
OH, REALLY?

70
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,502
WHAT ABOUT A LOGGING TRUCK?

71
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:30,810
[laughter and applause]

72
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,679
I'VE SEEN A WHOLE FOREST
GOING DOWN A HIGHWAY.

73
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,281
FIRE! FIRE!
[ring! ring! ring !]

74
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,222
WELL, I THINK
THAT WENT WELL.

75
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,823
THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANTED?

76
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,658
WE GOT THE TOWING
CONTRACT, DIDN'T WE?

77
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,827
YOU GOT A LOT
MORE THAN THAT.

78
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,229
THAT WAS THEIR IDEA.

79
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,496
I DIDN'T REALIZE

80
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,932
THAT ALL THE TOWN'S SERVICES
CAME UNDER THE ONE CONTRACT.

81
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,367
BUT, WE'LL
MAKE IT WORK.

82
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,703
SO, THE FIRE SERVICES
AND THE SNOW PLOWING

83
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:00,873
AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES
DOESN'T SCARE YOU AT ALL, HUH?

84
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,476
WE'LL FIGURE
IT OUT, HAROLD.

85
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:06,512
ANYWAY, NOTHING EVER
HAPPENS AROUND HERE.

86
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:16,122
[telephone ringing]

87
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,324
WELL, WHO DO YOU
SUPPOSE THAT'S FOR?

88
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:19,826
[phone ringing]
THE TOW TRUCK
WE DON'T HAVE?

89
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,227
THE FIRE TRUCK
WE DON'T NEED?

90
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,062
OR THE AMBULANCE
THAT DOESN'T EXIST?

91
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,897
Red:
DON'T ANSWER!

92
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,532
IT MIGHT BE AN EMERGENCY.

93
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,067
HELLO?

94
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:29,902
I'VE GOT TO GET
AN UNLISTED NUMBER.

95
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,704
IT'S MOOSE THOMPSON'S MOTHER!

96
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,607
MOOSE HAS GOT HIS HEAD
STUCK IN THE FRIDGE.

97
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:38,745
SHOULD WE SEND THE AMBULANCE
OR THE TOW TRUCK?

98
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,214
TELL HER TO JUST KNOCK
THE FRIDGE UP A NOTCH

99
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,782
AND ONCE HIS HEAD FREEZES,

100
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,617
IT'LL SHRINK.

101
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,319
[laughter]

102
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,557
OOOOH... 

103
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,959
WHEN YOU WISH UPON A STAR 

104
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:57,263
MAKE SURE IT'S
NOT OUR OWN SUN 

105
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,265
'CAUSE WISHING ON OUR SUN 

106
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,234
ISN'T VERY MUCH FUN 

107
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,537
UNLESS YOUR WISH IS
TO BURN OUT YOUR RETINAS 

108
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,608
AS WE MEN GET OLDER,

109
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,077
PEOPLE START TO PESTER US
TO EXERCISE MORE.

110
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,012
MOST OF US THINK WE'RE ALREADY
GETTING ENOUGH EXERCISE

111
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,214
WITH THE EQUIPMENT WE
USED FOR YEARS,

112
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,817
A FORK AND A REMOTE CONTROL.

113
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,719
PERSONALLY, I DON'T
WANT BUNS OF STEEL.

114
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,220
STEEL RUSTS

115
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:24,324
AND WHO WANTS FRIDGE MAGNETS
ALL OVER THEIR BUTT?

116
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,958
NOW, COMMON SENSE TELLS ME:

117
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,428
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WALK
ANYWHERE YOU CAN DRIVE,

118
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,130
SO THE CAR BECOMES A PERFECT
PLACE TO EXERCISE.

119
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:32,965
[crash!]

120
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:34,734
SO, THIS WEEK ON
"HANDYMAN CORNER,"

121
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,369
WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW

122
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:39,105
YOU CAN TURN YOUR CAR
INTO A TOTAL WORKOUT GYM.

123
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,040
LET'S START WITH THE GRIP.

124
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:45,011
A FIRM HANDSHAKE WILL MAKE
PEOPLE THINK YOU'RE IN SHAPE.

125
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:48,981
WHEN I DRIVE, I HAVE AT LEAST
ONE HAND ON THE WHEEL.

126
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,884
LET'S JUST ATTACH THE GRIP
TO THE WHEEL USING...

127
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,953
"THE HANDYMAN SECRET WEAPON:"

128
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,855
DUCT TAPE.

129
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,426
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS DRIVE ALONG THERE,

130
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,562
SQUEEZING ON YOUR EXERCISE GRIPS

131
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:03,830
[honk!]

132
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,465
[honk!]

133
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,133
AND THE HORN HONKS.

134
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,868
THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE THIS WAY,

135
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,137
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO EXERCISE
YOUR BICEPS AND TRICEPS

136
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,207
[hooonk!]
WAVING AT STRANGERS
YOU HAVE STARTLED.

137
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:21,013
NOW, YOU'LL SEE THOSE EXERCISE 
MACHINES ADVERTISED ON TV

138
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,049
WITH THE BUNGIES AND PULLEYS.

139
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:27,253
'CAUSE THEY'RE INTERESTED IN
GETTING THE SMOOTH TRANSACTION

140
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,255
WITH A VALID CREDIT CARD.

141
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,723
WELL, THAT'S OUT OF OUR LEAGUE.

142
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,192
WE'RE JUST GOING TO ATTACH
THIS AROUND THE DRIVER'S SEAT

143
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,827
USING THE HANDYMAN'S,

144
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,195
WELL, YOU KNOW...

145
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,666
NOW, YOU HOOK YOUR BUNGIES
UNDER THE DRIVERS'S SEAT

146
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,935
AND TAKE THEM UP THROUGH
THE PULLEY, LIKE THAT.

147
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,937
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
WEARING SUSPENDERS,

148
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,239
RULE OF THUMB:

149
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:48,107
IF YOUR BUTT IS UP WHERE
YOUR ARMPIT SHOULD BE,

150
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,776
YOU'VE GOT TOO MUCH TENSION.

151
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:54,914
THESE SHOVEL HANDLES MAKE IT
EASIER TO GRIP THE ENDS

152
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:58,017
AND PROBABLY KEEP YOU
FROM LOSING AN EYE.

153
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,119
PLUS, WHEN YOU'RE DISCUSSING
YOUR EXERCISE PROGRAM,

154
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,755
A SHOVEL CAN COME IN HANDY.

155
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,223
[clang!]

156
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,392
WELL, YOU SHOULD BE WATCHING.

157
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,194
WE NEED TO EXERCISE THE LARGEST

158
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,663
AND MOST OFTEN USED MUSCLE
OF THE BODY.

159
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,298
THIS MUSCLE RIGHT HERE.

160
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,000
SO, WE'RE GOING TO
BUILD A SIT-UP STATION

161
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,802
INTO OUR "TOTAL WORKOUT CAR"

162
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:19,238
BY CAREFULLY REMOVING
THE BACK SUPPORT OF THE SEAT.

163
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,812
[whack!]

164
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:28,414
I'VE LOOSENED OFF THE SEAT.

165
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,550
NOW, I CAN DO FULL SIT-UPS

166
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,685
WHILE DOING MY ARM EXERCISES.

167
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:33,953
ALL RIGHT.

168
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,088
LET'S GIVE HER A TEST RUN.

169
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,890
[breathing out]

170
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,325
UNNGHHH!!!

171
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,128
UNNGHH!!!

172
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,330
UNNGHHH!!!

173
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:46,866
UNGHHH!!!

174
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,434
NINETY-NINE...

175
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,470
OOOH!

176
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,607
THAT WORKED PERFECT, DIDN'T IT?

177
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,909
YOU MIGHT WANT TO KIND OF...

178
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,712
[creaking sounds]

179
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,280
...WORK UP TO THAT SLOWLY.

180
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:02,682
IN SMALL STEPS OVER...

181
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,584
50 OR 60 YEARS.

182
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,019
YOU KNOW, I THINK WE NEED
TO GET OUR LOWER BODY

183
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,088
FEELING JUST AS GOOD
AS OUR UPPER BODY.

184
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,858
SO, WE'RE GOING TO MODIFY
THE VEHICLE A LITTLE BIT

185
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:15,595
AND GIVE OUR LEGS
A LITTLE BIT OF A WORKOUT.

186
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,363
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS...

187
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,332
[creaking]

188
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:22,235
...TAKE THE TRANSMISSION FLUID

189
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:26,005
AND I'M GOING TO POUR IT ALL
OVER THE BRAKE SHOES AND DRUMS.

190
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,940
THAT WAY, WHEN I WANT
TO PUT ON THE BRAKES,

191
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,042
I'VE REALLY GOTTA HORSE 'ER ON

192
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,378
USING BOTH FEET.

193
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,881
THAT'LL BE GREAT FOR THE QUADS,

194
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:38,317
AND THE PECS,

195
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,286
AND THE TRAPS,

196
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,388
AND THE GLUTES.

197
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,856
AND ESPECIALLY...

198
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,692
THE INSURANCE POLICY.

199
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,829
[sound of running liquid]

200
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:55,368
NOW, I CAN EXERCISE
WHILE I'M DRIVING.

201
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,837
LIKE SAY, DOWN TO
THE ICE CREAM STORE.

202
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,806
I CAN EVEN GET THAT
"SUPER-DUPER SCOOPER CONE"

203
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,742
WITHOUT FEELING
THE LEAST BIT GUILTY.

204
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,110
SO, REMEMBER...

205
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,212
"IF THE WOMEN DON'T
FIND YOU HANDSOME,

206
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,649
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY."

207
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,651
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

208
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,452
IT'S TIME FOR MY WORKOUT.

209
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,323
[CRASH!!!]

210
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,597
SOONER OR LATER,

211
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:28,134
SOME MISGUIDED RELATIVE IS GOING
TO BUY YOU A GIFT BOX OF SOAP.

212
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,271
AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
USEFUL, REGULAR, NATURAL SOAP.

213
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,640
I'M TALKING ABOUT STUFF LIKE...

214
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,609
SCRUFFING LOTION,

215
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:40,012
HYDROLOGIZING MOISTURE GEL,

216
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,583
EXFOLIATING CREAM.

217
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:46,652
MEN DON'T NEED THAT.

218
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:50,323
WE HAVE A VERY SIMPLE APPROACH:

219
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,458
IF IT'S DIRTY - WASH IT.

220
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:53,926
IF IT'S HAIRY - CLIP IT.

221
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,461
IF IT NEEDS EXFOLIATING,

222
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:58,564
EITHER CALL YOUR PLUMBER
OR YOUR LOCAL CLERGYMAN.

223
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:03,302
[laughter and applause]

224
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,738
MAYBE YOU WANT TO GET FANCY.

225
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,107
YOU MIGHT WANT TO PUT ON
SOME AFTERSHAVE AND DEODORANT.

226
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:09,575
MAYBE A FRESH PAIR OF SOCKS.

227
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,544
BUT, YOU'VE GOT TO ASK YOURSELF:

228
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,779
WHO AM I TRYING TO IMPRESS?

229
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,215
IF THE ANSWER IS MY WIFE'S
BEST FRIEND CHANTEL,

230
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:21,020
YOUR LIFE'S ABOUT TO GET
WAY TOO COMPLICATED.

231
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,688
IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT
GETTING A LITTLE FANCY,

232
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,190
HERE'S A LITTLE TIP.

233
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:25,858
CLEANLINESS IS NEXT
TO GODLINESS,

234
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,893
BUT SCRUFFING IS NEXT
TO A HEART ATTACK

235
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,363
AND JUST THIS SIDE OF A DIVORCE.

236
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,598
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YA.

237
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,867
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

238
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,036
[applause]

239
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,176
OKAY, WE'VE GOT THE SNOW PLOW.

240
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:47,413
WE'RE GOING TO USE
STINKY PETERSON'S K-CAR.

241
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,017
THE K-CAR ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH
TO BE A PLOW.

242
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,519
NO, WE'RE GOING TO USE
THE K-CAR AS THE BLADE.

243
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:57,323
[loud laughter]

244
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,958
OH, YEAH.

WE'LL DUCT TAPE IT ONTO
DOUGIE'S MONSTER TRUCK.

247
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,198
AND FOR THE AMBULANCE,

248
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,734
WE'RE JUST GOING TO USE
THE POSSUM VAN.

249
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,336
WHAT ABOUT THE FIRE ENGINE?

250
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,737
AAAH!!!

251
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,240
WE'RE GOING TO USE
WINSTON'S SEWAGE TRUCK.

00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:17,143
[laughter]

253
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,084
THERE GOES THE OZONE LAYER.

00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,558
TRY ANSWERING THE PHONE.

00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,494
THIS IS SO EXCITING!

260
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,196

00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,333
YOUR DISASTER IS OUR PLEASURE.

00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,237
OH MY -- OH BOY!

264
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,173
IS IT FOR WINSTON
OR FOR DOUGIE?

265
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,008
YEAH, OKAY.

266
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,576
NO PROBLEM.

267
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,912
WE'LL BE THERE
AS FAST AS WE CAN.

268
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:56,482
WE'LL BE IN A BLUE VAN WITH
A POSSUM PAINTED ON THE SIDE.

269
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,217
BUT, IT'S ALL WE HAVE.

270
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,052
WELL, I SAID THAT TO HIM...

271
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,520
SORRY!!!

272
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:03,556
THANKS FOR CALLING!

00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,549
C'MON, LET'S GO.

280
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:33,219
HAROLD, YOU KNOW I HATE
THE SIGHT OF BLOOD.

281
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:34,820
HOW ABOUT THE SIGHT OF BABIES?

282
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,355
THAT'S WHAT SHE'S HAVING.

283
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:41,794
COME ON, COME ON!!!

284
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,000
AS YOU KNOW, THIS
IS NEW MEMBER NIGHT

285
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:51,270
AND DALTON HAS BROUGHT A FELLOW
HE WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT.

286
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,839
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO GET
ALL DRESSED UP FOR THIS.

287
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,908
THANK-YOU, RED.

288
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,544
I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE
MY GOOD FRIEND, SID LARSON.

289
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,514
Dalton:
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU,
SID IS MY KIND OF GUY.

290
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,048
[lodge members]
AAAh!!!

291
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,351
SETTLE DOWN, STOP THAT.

292
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:09,588
NOW, I'M HOPEFUL THAT SID COULD
BECOME MY DAUGHTER'S BOYFRIEND.

293
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:11,724
BUT AS A FIRST STEP,

294
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,325
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO SUPPORT ME

295
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,194
IN GETTING SID INTO THE LODGE.

296
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,729
AS YOU WELL KNOW,

297
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,798
MY DAUGHTER HAS
BAD TASTE IN MEN.

298
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:22,868
Dalton:
SO, I'M THINKING THAT SYD
HAS GOT A REAL SHOT AT IT.

299
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,970
OF COURSE, IT'S BOUND TO
BE A BIG IMPROVEMENT.

300
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:28,174
I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT
HER CURRENT BOYFRIEND
IS BETWEEN JOBS.

301
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,509
BUT, HE'S NEVER HAD ONE.

302
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,178
ON THE OTHER HAND,

303
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:36,448
SID HAS BEEN RUNNING
THE WEIGH STATION
FOR 15 YEARS.

304
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,751
GETTING MY DAUGHTER
ON THAT WEIGH SCALE

305
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,320
MIGHT NOT BE
A BAD IDEA, SID.

306
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,322
[laughter]

307
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:48,561
YESIREE, MY DAUGHTER HAS
NO CONCEPT OF SAVING MONEY,

308
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:49,662
NONE AT ALL.

309
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,096
SID, ON THE OTHER HAND,

310
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,399
IS THE CHEAPEST MAN I'VE MET.

311
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,367
HOOKING THEM TWO TOGETHER

312
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,736
IS GOING TO BE LIKE
THE CLASH OF THE TITANS

313
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:00,172
THAT MOST MARRIAGES
COULD ONLY DREAM ABOUT.

314
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,007
I'M ASKING YOU
TO SUPPORT ME

315
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,275
IN MAKING HIM A MEMBER

316
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,077
AND DOING ME A FAVOUR.

317
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,712
THANK-YOU, VERY MUCH.

318
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,147
ALL THOSE IN FAVOUR?

319
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,350
BY THE WAY...

320
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,885
THE BANK SAYS AS SOON
AS SID IS A MEMBER,

321
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,653
WE GET THAT LODGE LOAN.

[narrated by Red]
I'M NOT SURE WHAT BILL HAS
IN MIND FOR TODAY.

324
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:23,495
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

325
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,030
LET ME SEE IT.

326
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,166
I CAN'T READ IT.

327
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,002
OH, WILD HONEY.

328
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,606
WHAT'S THE HOCKEY STICK FOR?

329
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,009
OH, NO!

330
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,677
BILL, NO!

331
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,713
NOT A HOCKEY STICK.

332
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,215
THAT'S JUST NOT SMART.

333
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,152
THERE'S A HIVE!

334
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,188
THAT'S NOT SMART, BILL.

335
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,923
YEAH, YOU GOT 'EM.

336
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,358
THERE THEY ARE.

00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:55,060
[bees buzzing]

338
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:57,496
I THINK I'LL JUST STAND HERE.

00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,331
QUIETLY.

340
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,870
NOW, HE'S TRYING TO
GET SOME SMOKE GOING.

341
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,673
THERE'S NOT TOO MUCH SMOKE
COMING OUT OF THAT FIRE.

342
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,378
I HOPE THAT'S WATER.

343
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,647
ALL RIGHT, PUT THAT
ON THE GRASS AND...

344
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,248
I SEE...

345
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,686
THAT'S NOT MUCH SMOKE, BILL.

346
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,621
GET SOME MORE WATER.

347
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,523
YOU NEED MORE WATER.

348
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,759
GET SOME MORE WATER.

349
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,862

00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:39,939
WHERE'S THE GAS CAN?

353
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,174
THERE IT IS.

354
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,611
WHAT'S THIS NOW?

355
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,646
OH...

356
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,585
YOU'RE GONNA GET THE HIVE?

OH, YEAH!

00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,341
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK I'LL DO?

364
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:16,942
RIGHT!

[bees buzzing furiously]

366
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,451
WHAT NOW, BILL?

367
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,019
OH, YES.

368
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,754

00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,389
THAT'S GREAT.

00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,229
NO PROBLEM.

373
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,964
WHAT'S GOING ON?

DO YOUR LAUNDRY.

LA-LA-LA 

396
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,961
WE'D LIKE TO MAKE OUR HOUSE
SAFE FROM INTRUDERS,

397
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,830
BUT WE CAN'T AFFORD AN
EXPENSIVE ALARM SYSTEM.

398
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,000
SO, WE'VE WIRED OUR OUTSIDE
DOOR KNOBS TO THE STOVE.

399
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,537
[laughter]

400
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,739
WE DON'T HAVE
ANY INTRUDERS,

401
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,808
BUT WE'VE BEEN
ELECTROCUTED
SO MANY TIMES

402
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,677
THAT WE'VE BURNED ALL
THE HAIR OFF OUR ARMS.

404
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,950
ANY SUGGESTIONS?

00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:08,520
YEAH, WEAR OVEN MITTS.

406
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,289
I THINK IT'S TERRIBLE
WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY

407
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:13,392
WHERE PEOPLE BREAK INTO
OTHER PEOPLE'S HOMES.

408
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:14,893
I RESENT THAT, HAROLD.

409
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,262
I WASN'T ANYWHERE
NEAR THE PLACE.

410
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:20,032
I WAS WITH FLINTY McCLINTOCK.

411
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,834
MIKE, FLINTY'S
OUT OF TOWN.

412
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,602
SEE, THERE YOU GO.

413
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,604
I WAS OUT OF TOWN.

414
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,739
WE'RE NOT
ACCUSING YOU.

415
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,241
WE'RE RESPONDING TO
THE VIEWER'S QUESTION.

416
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,376
OH, RIGHT.

417
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:35,881
I THINK THAT ALARM SYSTEMS
ARE REALLY UNNECESSARY

418
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,884
BECAUSE NICE PEOPLE COULD...

419
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:44,756
NICE PEOPLE COULD GET
ACCIDENTLY HURT, OR SOMETHING.

420
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:48,527
NICE PEOPLE
LIKE YOU, MIKE?

421
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,863
NOT LIKE ME,
MR. GREEN.

422
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,332
'CAUSE I WAS
OUT OF TOWN.
OH, RIGHT.

423
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:56,135
I'LL TELL THIS VIEWER WHAT
ONE OF MY DADS TOLD ME.

424
00:18:56,201 --> 00:19:01,273
WHICH ONE OF YOUR DADS?

425
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,809
IT WAS MY FRIDAY DAD.

426
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,611
TWO WEEKS RUNNING.

427
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:10,249
HE ONCE SAID:

428
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:15,721
"DO UNTO OTHERS BEFORE
SOMEONE DOES IT TO YOU."

429
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,723
HE SAYS THAT'S IN THE BIBLE.

430
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,325
NOT IN THE KING JAMES VERSION.

431
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:24,129
MAYBE THE JESSE JAMES VERSION.

432
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,432
WELL...

433
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,235
THIS DAD WAS A CLERGYMAN,
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

434
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:35,908
'CAUSE HE PLAYED DRUMS
IN A 
 JUDAS PRIEST
TRIBUTE BAND.

435
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,076
HE ALWAYS USED TO SAY

436
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:42,848
THAT PEOPLE SHOULD FOLLOW
"THE GOLD CARD RULE."

437
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,983
I THINK HE MEANT
"THE GOLDEN RULE."

438
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,086
NO, "THE GOLD CARD RULE."

439
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:49,888
"IF YOU WANT TO
PROTECT YOUR STUFF,

440

442

THAT WAS SO FANTASTIC!!!

443

THAT WAS AWESOME!

444
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,570
THE MIRACLE OF BIRTH!!!

445
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:05,871
IT WAS A BABY

446
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,372
AND I WAS IN CHARGE.

447
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:10,108
I DID IT ALL!

448
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,044
WELL, I GUESS THE MOTHER
HELPED OUT A LITTLE BIT,

449
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,046
BUT I WAS THERE!

450
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,114
AND THANK-YOU FOR NOT
BUTTING IN AND TAKING OVER.

451
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,816
THAT WAS GREAT.

452
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,754
NO PROBLEM, HAROLD.

453
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,356
DID YOU SEE THE BIRTH?

454
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,758
NOT ON PURPOSE.

THE HEAD CROWN,

HAROLD...

458
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,932
WE DON'T NEED TO
KNOW THE DETAILS.

459
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,101
MOTHER AND SON
ARE DOING FINE.

460
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,936
THAT'S ALL
THAT MATTERS.

461
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,705
THAT WAS A GIRL.

NO, NO, NO.

463
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,308
THAT WAS DEFINITELY A BOY.

NO, YOU WERE LOOKING
AT THE UMBILICAL CORD.

I NEVER WANT TO GO
THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

WELL, YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO HAVE TO.

469
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:00,492
WE'VE RIPPED UP
OUR SERVICE CONTRACT
WITH THE TOWN COUNCIL

BEFORE ANYONE GETS HURT.

MATURE OF YOU.

THE TOWN COUNCIL?

473

AND THE GANG AT POSSUM LODGE:

487
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,429
"KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE."

488
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:41,099
[applause]

489
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,177
ALL RISE.

490
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:59,551
[lodge members]
QUANDO, OMNI, FLUNKUS, MORITATI.

491
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,219
SIT DOWN.

492
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,522
WE JUST GOT OUR VEHICLE
SERVICE REPORT UPDATED.

493
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:06,325
WE NO LONGER HAVE
ANY SERVICE VEHICLES.

494
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,126
IT SEEMS THAT
WINSTON'S FIRE ENGINE

495
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,195
WAS BEING TOWED BY
DOUGIE'S MONSTER TRUCK

496
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,030
WHEN IT GOT PLOWED
BY THE SNOW PLOW

497
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,899
AND BURST INTO FLAMES.

498
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,834
BUT, THERE IS AN UPSIDE

499
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,602
BECAUSE DOUGIE'S BRAKE LET GO

500
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,105
AND THE ENTIRE FIREBALL ROLLED
RIGHT INTO POSSUM LAKE.

501
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,040
WHICH IS A WIN/WIN.

502
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,608
THE WATER PUT THE FIRE OUT

503
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,811
AND THE LAKE IS UP
ABOUT A FOOT OR SO.

504
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:28,146
