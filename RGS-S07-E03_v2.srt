1
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:11,177
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW."

2
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:14,814
NOW, PLEASE HELP ME
WELCOME A MAN WHO
BELIEVES THAT CHARITY
SHOULD START AT HOME

3
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:16,049
BUT NOT WHEN HE'S HOME...

4
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:19,085
YOUR HOST, YOUR HERO,
MY UNCLE, RED GREEN.

5
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:27,494
(APPLAUSE)

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,695
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

7
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,296
THANK YOU.

8
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,232
KIND OF A FRUSTRATING
WEEK UP AT THE LODGE
THIS WEEK.

9
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:34,033
WE GOT THIS HISTORICAL SOCIETY;

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,969
POSSUM LAKE HISTORICAL SOCIETY.

11
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:40,073
THINKS EVERYTHING SHOULD BE THE
SAME WAY IT WAS 100 YEARS AGO.

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,742
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING, NEW
IS A LOT OF TIMES BETTER.

13
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,811
YOU KNOW, THE ADVERTISERS SAY,
"NEW AND IMPROVED."

14
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,214
YOU DON'T HEAR,
"OLD AND IMPROVED."

15
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:50,450
NOTHING GETS OLD AND IMPROVED...

16
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:53,753
EXCEPT YOU, BERNICE.

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,556
ACTUALLY, UNCLE RED, I THINK
WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS A
VERY GOOD IDEA.

18
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:57,257
I THINK IT'S GREAT,

19
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:59,259
PRESERVING OUR HERITAGE.

20
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:01,895
HISTORY IS  AN
EXCELLENT TEACHER.

21
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:03,429
IF YOU WANT TO CLUE
INTO THE FUTURE,

22
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:05,465
LOOK INTO THE PAST.

23
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:10,169
OH, YEAH, HAROLD, IF YOU WANT
TO CLUE INTO YOUR FUTURE,
LOOK INTO THE MIRROR.

24
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,704
THIS HISTORICAL SOCIETY,

25
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,006
THEY'VE HAVE BEEN
CALLING ME ALL WEEK.

26
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:14,474
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANT --
PROBABLY A DONATION.

27
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,742
AND FOR WHAT?

28
00:01:15,808 --> 00:01:18,311
THEY'RE LIKE A TELETHON
WITHOUT A DISEASE, YOU KNOW?

29
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:19,746
I'LL TELL YOU, I WOULDN'T
GIVE 'EM A DIME,

30
00:01:19,812 --> 00:01:21,080
NOT ONE DIME.

31
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:23,082
OH, YOU MIGHT
CHANGE YOUR MIND.

32
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:24,083
WHAT HAVE YOU
GOT THERE, HAROLD?

33
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,320
THIS? OH, THIS?
O-O-H, THIS.
YES.

34
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,155
WELL, THIS IS JUST A LETTER
FROM THE HISTORICAL SOCIETY

35
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:33,026
WITH A PROPOSAL THAT THE
LODGE MIGHT BE DEEMED A
HISTORICAL LOCATION.

36
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:35,395
WOW, ALL RIGHT.

37
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:36,963
NOW YOU'RE TALKING.

38
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,164
YES, AND SO WERE YOU.

39
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:39,465
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?

40
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:41,501
OH, AH, OH, RIGHT.

41
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:44,804
IF ANYBODY FROM THIS
HISTORICAL SOCIETY
IS WATCHING,

42
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,974
I CERTAINLY HOPE YOU DIDN'T
MISUNDERSTAND SOME OF MY
EARLIER COMMENTS.

43
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:52,578
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU LET ME FINISH,

44
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,781
I WAS --
WHAT I MEANT WAS THAT

45
00:01:54,847 --> 00:01:58,184
I THINK THE LODGE HERE IS A
PERFECT PLACE FOR YOU TO SPEND
YOUR RESTORATION DOLLARS.

46
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,853
AND IF YOU DO HAPPEN TO CHECK
YOUR VOICE MAIL LATER,

47
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,724
AND HEAR A MESSAGE FROM ME
THAT INCLUDES THE PHRASE

48
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,227
"UP YOURS WITH A WIRE BRUSH,"

49
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:13,499
THAT WAS REALLY TALKING ABOUT
A CERTAIN KIND OF WIRE BRUSH

50
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:16,436
THAT THE PIONEERS USED.

51
00:02:16,502 --> 00:02:21,307
THEY OFTEN WOULD CLEAN -- THE
OLD WIRE BRUSH CLEANINGS
THEY WOULD DO ON BUILDINGS,

52
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,676
LIKE THE LODGE, WHICH
ARE OUR HERITAGE.

53
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,611
WE INHERITED THEM.

54
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:30,082
HOW CAN YOU STAND THERE AND SAY
THINGS THAT DON'T HAVE A
SHRED OF TRUTH TO THEM?

55
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:33,986
WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT
MARRIED PEOPLE JUST DO, HAROLD.

56
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:37,223
EXCEPT FOR US, BERNICE.

57
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:51,971
[QUIRKY UPBEAT MUSIC]

58
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:56,576
HERE'S A FEW SCENES FROM THIS
PARTICULAR EPISODE, AND IF YOU
HAVEN'T DECIDED WHETHER OR NOT
TO WATCH IT,

59
00:02:56,642 --> 00:02:59,412
WE'RE HOPING THIS WILL KIND OF
PUSH YOU OVER THE TOP ON THAT.

60
00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:01,881
WE'RE GOING TO TRY AND
ENTERTAIN YOU AS LONG
AS WE CAN.

61
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,983
WE EVEN GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOU TO DRINK...

62
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,818
A BIG BOTTLE OF COLA.

63
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,791
RICHARDSON'S MUSIC STORE IS
LOOKING FOR A PIANO TEACHER.

64
00:03:11,857 --> 00:03:17,830
APPLICANTS MUST BE FEMALE WITH
AT LEAST 50 YEARS EXPERIENCE,
BLUE HAIR AND FUNNY
SMELLING CLOTHES.

65
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,701
OH.

66
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:23,803
SO I GO AGAINST
MY BETTER JUDGMENT,

67
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:28,107
I LET THEM CLASSIFY THE LODGE
AS A HISTORICAL SITE,
THEY LAY THIS ON ME.

68
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,408
RULES AND REGULATIONS...

69
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,210
WHAT I CAN DO;
WHAT I CAN'T DO;

70
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:34,180
HOW I HAVE TO MAINTAIN THE
INTEGRITY OF THE BUILDING.

71
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:38,150
WHY SHOULD THE BUILDING HAVE
INTEGRITY IF THE PEOPLE
IN IT DON'T?

72
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:41,187
YEAH, BUT, UNCLE RED, THE
HISTORICAL SOCIETY IS PAYING
FOR ALL THE WORK, AREN'T THEY?

73
00:03:41,253 --> 00:03:42,988
YEAH, RIGHT.

74
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:47,059
THEY'LL COVER 1/3 OF THE
RESTORATION COST UP TO
A MAXIMUM OF $50.

75
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,095
THIS ROOF REPAIR ALONE
IS GOING 500 BUCKS,

76
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:52,465
AND THAT'S JUST FOR
THE DUCT TAPE.

77
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:55,901
NA, NA, NA, NA-NA, NA!

78
00:03:55,968 --> 00:03:59,105
SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
DON'T READ THE FINE PRINT?

79
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:03,142
YEAH, YOU END UP HAVING YOUR
NEPHEW WORK FOR YOU.

80
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,544
ANYWAY, I HAVE A
BETTER SOLUTION.

81
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:10,149
I GOT THE HISTORICAL SOCIETY
TO DECLASSIFY THE LODGE
AND LEAVE US ALONE.

82
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,318
AND WE'VE AGREED TO DONATE
OUR OLD SMOKEHOUSE

83
00:04:12,384 --> 00:04:14,653
WHICH IS THE MOST
HISTORICAL THING WE HAVE.

84
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,123
WHAT'S SO HISTORICAL
ABOUT THE OLD SMOKEHOUSE?

85
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:20,860
WELL, HAROLD, IT WAS
BACK IN, I BELIEVE, 1856,

86
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:22,394
THE FIRST SETTLERS CAME,

87
00:04:22,461 --> 00:04:24,830
AND THEY BUILT THAT OLD
SMOKEHOUSE AS KIND OF
A CRUDE CABIN

88
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:27,299
TO GET THEM THROUGH
THAT FIRST ROUGH WINTER.

89
00:04:27,366 --> 00:04:29,635
AND, I BELIEVE,
WHEN THEY BUILT
A LARGER HOME,

90
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:32,771
THEY CONVERTED THAT BUILDING
INTO THE SMOKEHOUSE YOU SEE NOW.

91
00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:36,909
OH, REALLY?
OH, OH.
YEAH, YEAH.

92
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:41,280
WELL, HOW COME IT'S JUST A,
LIKE, A PRE-FAB PIECE OF PLYWOOD
THAT WE USE AS A TOOLSHED NOW?

93
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:43,983
BECAUSE YOU'RE LYING,
THAT'S WHY.

94
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,554
YOU KNOW, HAROLD, I BELIEVE IT
WAS ABRAHAM LINCOLN WHO SAID

95
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:52,625
THAT HISTORY IS TINGED WITH
TRUTHS AND HALF TRUTHS
THAT ARE AS ONE.

96
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:55,527
HE NEVER SAID THAT.
YOU'RE LYING AGAIN.
NO.

97
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:56,362
YES.
NO.

98
00:04:56,428 --> 00:04:57,963
UNCLE RED IS
MAKING LIES.

99
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,366
NO, UNCLE RED IS
MAKING HISTORY.

100
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:04,136
(APPLAUSE)

101
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:07,039
OKAY, IT'S TIME TO PLAY THE
POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME.

102
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:09,208
AND, THIS WEEK, WE'RE PLAYING
FOR A BEAUTY OF A PRIZE.

103
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:13,045
IF YOU OWN A MAGIC MASTER
REFRIGERATOR/FREEZER WITH
A SELF-DEFROSTING UNIT,

104
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,314
AND IT'S GOT THE HIGH
EFFICIENCY THERMOSTAT,

105
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:19,184
WELL, THEN, YOU'VE GOT
THE PERFECT PLACE TO STORE
THIS WEEK'S GRAND PRIZE...

106
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:21,220
A BIG BOTTLE OF COLA.

107
00:05:21,286 --> 00:05:24,289
(APPLAUSE)

108
00:05:24,356 --> 00:05:27,326
YES, MADE AVAILABLE FROM
RITA'S SUNDRIES AND SUCH.

109
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:31,897
OKAY. UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE 30
SECONDS TO GET Mr. MIKE HAMAR
TO SAY THIS WORD...

110
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:37,936
SERVE.

111
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:40,039
THIRTY SECONDS, AND GO.

112
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:43,509
ALL RIGHT, MIKE, YOU GO
INTO A STORE, THE CLERK
COMES OVER AND SAYS,
"HAVE YOU BEEN..."

113
00:05:43,575 --> 00:05:47,513
SHOPLIFTING?

114
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:49,214
NO, THIS IS IN A NICE WAY,

115
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:50,883
SHE SAYS, "MAY I SOMETHING YOU"?

116
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:52,918
STRIP SEARCH?

117
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,754
OKAY, IT'S A RESTAURANT --
IT'S A RESTAURANT.

118
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:57,723
YOU GO IN THE RESTAURANT AND
THE WAITRESS COMES OVER TO...

119
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,092
HASSLE ME.

120
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:04,396
NO, MIKE, SHE'S FRIENDLY.
SHE SAYS, "CAN I SOMETHING YOU?"

121
00:06:04,463 --> 00:06:05,397
WELL, HOW FRIENDLY IS SHE?

122
00:06:05,464 --> 00:06:10,369
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

123
00:06:10,435 --> 00:06:12,271
REMEMBER WHEN YOU
LIVED AT HOME, OKAY?

124
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:14,807
DINNER WAS READY; YOUR MOM
WOULD SAY, "DINNER IS..."

125
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:18,177
POURED?

126
00:06:18,243 --> 00:06:19,411
ALMOST OUT OF TIME,
UNCLE RED.

127
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:21,046
OKAY, OKAY.

128
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:26,051
MIKE, THE OUTSIDE OF A POLICE
CAR, IT SAYS, "TO SOMETHING
AND PROTECT"?

129
00:06:26,118 --> 00:06:30,522
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST SEE
THE HEADLIGHTS AND THEN
THE BACK SEAT.

130
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:33,992
DON'T YOU -- DON'T YOU NOTICE
ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE DOOR
AS YOU'RE GETTING IN?

131
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:37,429
NO, I'M USUALLY UNCONSCIOUS.

132
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:40,432
AND THEN I HAVE MY JACKET OVER
MY HEAD WHEN I GO TO JAIL,

133
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:43,001
AND I TRY TO KEEP IT THERE
UNTIL I'VE SERVED MY SENTENCE.

134
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:45,370
(RINGING BELL)

135
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:47,239
ALL RIGHT, A BIG
BOTTLE OF POP.

136
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,413
LAST SATURDAY, I WAS MOWING THE
LAWN IN A KIND OF A HURRY

137
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,449
BECAUSE THE AFTERNOON MOVIE
WAS "WHERE EAGLES DARE."

138
00:06:57,516 --> 00:06:58,550
AND IT'S KIND OF A GUY MOVIE.

139
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:00,085
YOU KNOW:  GOOD GUYS, BAD GUYS.

140
00:07:00,152 --> 00:07:03,455
AND THEY MAKE WAR
KIND OF LOOK LIKE FUN;
YOU'VE GOT TO LOVE THAT.

141
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:06,992
UNFORTUNATELY, I WAS MOWING THE
LAWN AT THE FULL SPEED, AND
ON MY LAST PASS THERE,

142
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:11,363
I SIDESWIPED BERNICE'S CEMENT
LEPRECHAUN LAWN ORNAMENT.

143
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,398
YOU KNOW HOW THEY SAY THAT
LEPRECHAUN'S ARE LUCKY?

144
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:16,301
I'LL TELL YOU, THIS ONE'LL
NEVER GET LUCKY AGAIN.

145
00:07:16,368 --> 00:07:19,805
AND THE LAWN TRACTOR DIDN'T
FAIR MUCH BETTER.

146
00:07:19,871 --> 00:07:21,973
NOW, SOME CYNICAL
PEOPLE MIGHT SAY,

147
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,843
"BOY, IT'S GOT TO BE MORE
THAN A COINCIDENCE THAT YOU
WRECK YOUR OLD LAWN TRACTOR

148
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:29,247
"THE DAY AFTER YOU SEE THE
NEW LAWN TRACTORS DOWN AT
MURRAY'S STORE."

149
00:07:29,314 --> 00:07:32,584
BUT, BERNICE,
BELIEVE ME, I WAS UPSET.

150
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:34,619
I COULD HARDLY ENJOY
"WHERE EAGLES DARE."

151
00:07:34,686 --> 00:07:36,455
BUT, YOU KNOW AT THE END
THERE, WHERE CLINT EASTWOOD,

152
00:07:36,521 --> 00:07:39,791
HE RIDES OFF ON A
MOTORCYCLE SIDECAR?

153
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:42,360
BY GOLLY, LOOKED LIKE
A LOT OF FUN TO ME.

154
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:44,129
GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW
TO GET ONE OF THOSE.

155
00:07:44,196 --> 00:07:48,800
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, I'D SPENT
SO MUCH MONEY ON THE
NEW LAWN TRACTOR

156
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:51,770
THAT I HAD TO FIND A CHEAP
WAY TO MAKE MYSELF ONE
OF THESE UNITS.

157
00:07:51,837 --> 00:07:53,371
SO, BASICALLY, YOU'VE GOT
THREE COMPONENTS...

158
00:07:53,438 --> 00:07:55,941
YOU'VE GOT YOUR MOTOR;
YOU GOT A CYCLE;
YOU GOT A SIDECAR.

159
00:07:56,007 --> 00:07:56,775
I'VE GOT THE MOTOR.

160
00:07:56,842 --> 00:07:58,110
I'VE GOT THE SIDECAR.

161
00:07:58,176 --> 00:08:00,212
ALL'S I NEED IS THE CYCLE.

162
00:08:00,278 --> 00:08:03,181
SO I STRUNG A ROPE ACROSS --
AT CHEST HEIGHT -- RIGHT ACROSS
THE BIKE PATH UP HERE.

163
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:04,649
(SOMEONE SCREAMS)

164
00:08:04,716 --> 00:08:06,451
OH, BOY...

165
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:08,386
OH, HAROLD, YOU'RE FINE.

166
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:10,021
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE IN BUSINESS NOW.

167
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:13,191
NOW, USUALLY, THE MOTOR IS
IN THE CYCLE PART.

168
00:08:13,258 --> 00:08:16,228
BUT, WITH ME, I GOT THE MOTOR
IN THE SIDE CAR,

169
00:08:16,294 --> 00:08:17,596
SO THE PROJECT
BECOMES REAL EASY.

170
00:08:17,662 --> 00:08:20,832
ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS WELD
THE CYCLE TO THE SIDECAR.

171
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:25,303
YOU KNOW, WELDING MAY LOOK
DANGEROUS BECAUSE, OF COURSE,

172
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,774
YOU'VE GOT A FULL TANK OF
OXYGEN AND A FULL TANK OF
EXPLOSIVE ACETYLENE.

173
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:34,179
OF COURSE, THAT'S WHY THEY GIVE
YOU THE SAFETY GOGGLES.

174
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:39,384
A'RIGHT, LET'S START BY
JUST WELDING THE BIKE
TO THE LAWN MOWER,

175
00:08:39,451 --> 00:08:41,987
AND THEN, WELL, WE'RE DONE.

176
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:48,426
ALMOST DONE HERE.

177
00:08:52,497 --> 00:08:56,267
ALL RIGHT, WE'VE HAD THE
TORCH A LITTLE HOT THERE.

178
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:59,237
THIS IS WHY YOU WANT TO KEEP
A GARDEN HOSE AROUND.

179
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,543
U-M-M, ALL RIGHT --
NO -- THAT'S -- NO.

180
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,581
THAT WILL BURN DOWN IN
NO TIME, YOU KNOW?

181
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:13,118
A GOOD TIME TO USE THE SAFETY
GOGGLES. THEY'RE TINTED.

182
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:15,286
SO I'M THINKING, I'M NOT EVEN
GOING TO BOTHER WELDING HER.

183
00:09:15,353 --> 00:09:19,190
I'M JUST GOING TO USE THE
HANDYMAN'S SECRET WEAPON...

184
00:09:19,257 --> 00:09:20,992
IS THIS TAPE ON FIRE?

185
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:22,160
NO.

186
00:09:35,273 --> 00:09:39,377
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE ALL SET TO
GO "WHERE EAGLES DARE."

187
00:09:39,444 --> 00:09:44,482
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN DON'T
FIND YOU HANDSOME, THEY SHOULD
AT LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

188
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:47,519
IT STARTS.
IT RUNS.
IT GOES.

189
00:09:47,585 --> 00:09:49,387
IT GOES FAST; IT TURNS...

190
00:09:49,454 --> 00:09:50,722
IT DOESN'T TURN.

191
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:52,357
(CRASH)

192
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,430
I WANT TO TAKE A FEW MINUTES
AND TALK TO SOME OF YOU
OLDER FELLAS OUT THERE.

193
00:09:59,497 --> 00:10:06,037
YOU KNOW, THERE COMES A TIME IN
EVERY MAN'S LIFE WHEN A DOCTOR
IS GOING TO PRESCRIBE FOR
YOU A LITTLE PILL;

194
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:09,374
MAYBE FOR YOUR HEART,
YOUR KNEE OR YOUR BACK.

195
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,777
AND LIKE IT OR NOT, YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO TAKE ONE OF THOSE
PILLS EVERY DAY

196
00:10:12,844 --> 00:10:17,649
FOR THE REST OF YOUR, ALL OF A
SUDDEN, VERY SHORT LIFE.

197
00:10:17,715 --> 00:10:21,753
NOW, A LOT OF YOU MAY NOT REACT
FAVOURABLY TO THIS NEW REGIMEN.

198
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:26,558
IT'S TUESDAY, SO IT MUST BE TIME
FOR MY ANTI-INFLAMMATORY.

199
00:10:26,624 --> 00:10:28,660
I WANT YOU TO LOOK
AT THE BRIGHT SIDE.

200
00:10:28,726 --> 00:10:34,599
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN YOUR
LIFE RIGHT NOW CAN BE
SOLVED WITH A PILL.

201
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,635
THINK BACK TO ALL OF THE
PROBLEMS YOU HAD WHEN
YOU WERE YOUNGER...

202
00:10:37,702 --> 00:10:41,639
LOVE, MONEY, CHILDREN,
WORK, NEIGHBOURS.

203
00:10:41,706 --> 00:10:45,310
COULDN'T SOLVE THEM
WITH A PILL, HUH?

204
00:10:45,376 --> 00:10:50,014
SEE, YOU'RE NOT GETTING
OLDER, YOU'RE GETTING
BETTER MEDICATION.

205
00:10:50,081 --> 00:10:52,550
SO ENJOY AND DON'T
FORGET YOUR PILLS.

206
00:10:52,617 --> 00:10:57,255
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

207
00:11:01,826 --> 00:11:05,830
MAN, WE'RE GOING FROM THE FRYING
PAN TO THE FIRE WITH THIS
HISTORICAL SOCIETY.

208
00:11:05,897 --> 00:11:08,266
I WISH THEY WERE HISTORY.

209
00:11:08,332 --> 00:11:11,369
THEY DECIDED THAT THE OLD
SMOKEHOUSE IS NOT A
HISTORICAL SITE

210
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:15,239
BECAUSE SOMEBODY TOLD THEM MY
STORY ABOUT THE SETTLERS IS
A LOAD OF BALONEY.

211
00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:21,646
PRETTY MUCH WHAT I THOUGHT.

212
00:11:21,713 --> 00:11:23,748
ANYWAY, BEFORE THEY START
EYEBALLING THE LODGE AGAIN,

213
00:11:23,815 --> 00:11:27,752
I FIGURED OUT A WAY TO MAKE THE
SMOKEHOUSE INTO A CASH DONATION.

214
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:30,321
WE'RE GOING TO SELL IT AND
THEN GIVE THEM THE MONEY.

215
00:11:30,388 --> 00:11:32,590
HEY, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA,
UNCLE RED. THAT'S TERRIFIC.

216
00:11:32,657 --> 00:11:33,791
AND I COULD BE
THE SALES AGENT.

217
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:34,892
I'VE SEEN THEM ON TV.
YEAH.

218
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:35,827
I'VE SEEN
THEM ON TV.
YEAH.

219
00:11:35,893 --> 00:11:37,495
I COULD DO IT,
YEAH.

220
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:38,729
LIKE, YOU KNOW, YEAH.
LOOKING FOR CASH?

221
00:11:38,796 --> 00:11:40,064
LOOKING TO GET OUT OF
TOWN IN A HURRY?

222
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:42,433
I'M HAROLD GREEN, AND I COULD
SELL YOUR HOUSE FAST.

223
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,768
CALL 1-800-HAROLD.

224
00:11:43,835 --> 00:11:46,437
I'M A CLOSER.

225
00:11:46,504 --> 00:11:53,511
(APPLAUSE)

226
00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:54,712
YOU'RE A WHAT?

227
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:56,481
I'M A CLOSER.

228
00:11:56,547 --> 00:11:59,417
WELL, START
WITH YOUR MOUTH.

229
00:11:59,483 --> 00:12:01,719
HAROLD, I'D RATHER YOU
JUST LAY LOW ON THIS DEAL.

230
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:06,224
NOBODY IS GOING TO BUY THIS
PLACE IF THEY KNOW YOU
LIVE AROUND HERE.

231
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,826
SO IF ANY OF
YOU ARE LOOKING
FOR A SMOKEHOUSE,

232
00:12:08,893 --> 00:12:09,961
YOU KNOW, A PLACE
YOU CAN SMOKE IN --

233
00:12:10,027 --> 00:12:12,496
NOT MANY OF
THEM LEFT,

234
00:12:12,563 --> 00:12:13,497
WE'VE GOT A GOOD
ONE FOR SALE.

235
00:12:13,564 --> 00:12:15,333
REAL SOLID PLYWOOD.

236
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:17,702
OH, PLYWOOD IS NOT REAL SOLID.

237
00:12:17,768 --> 00:12:19,503
WELL, THE KNOTS ARE SOLID.

238
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,672
AND, I BELIEVE, THE DOOR
IS PRETTY MUCH RUSTED
SOLID, THERE.

239
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:23,407
AND GOT THE CENTRAL
HEATING IN HER.

240
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:24,575
IT DOES?

241
00:12:24,642 --> 00:12:27,111
WELL, THE WOOD STOVE
IS IN THE MIDDLE.

242
00:12:27,178 --> 00:12:28,879
AND I THINK --
I BELIEVE --

243
00:12:28,946 --> 00:12:31,349
I BELIEVE AT ONE TIME,
SHE HAD ELECTRICITY.

244
00:12:31,415 --> 00:12:32,617
WHEN WAS THAT?

245
00:12:32,683 --> 00:12:35,453
WHEN THE LIGHTNING
HIT IT.

246
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,188
HAROLD, DON'T BE
SO NEGATIVE, OKAY?

247
00:12:37,254 --> 00:12:38,990
IN THE BIBLE, YOU KNOW,

248
00:12:39,056 --> 00:12:42,126
THERE WAS A GUY WHO KILLED
THE PHILISTINES WITH THE
JAWBONE OF AN ASS?

249
00:12:42,193 --> 00:12:46,330
YOU'RE GOING TO KILL
THIS SALE WITH EXACTLY
THE SAME WEAPON.

250
00:12:46,397 --> 00:12:51,535
(APPLAUSE)

251
00:12:51,602 --> 00:12:55,473
OKAY, IT'S ONCE AGAIN TIME FOR
THE MEETING OF MEN'S ANONYMOUS.

252
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:59,176
AND, AS ALWAYS, I WOULD LIKE
TO INTRODUCE MY UNCLE RED TO
LEAD US IN THE PLEDGE.

253
00:12:59,243 --> 00:13:00,811
GO RED!

254
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:03,080
I'M A MAN,

255
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:04,415
BUT I CAN CHANGE

256
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:06,016
IF I HAVE TO,

257
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,386
I GUESS.

258
00:13:08,452 --> 00:13:11,922
(APPLAUSE)

259
00:13:11,989 --> 00:13:14,525
VERY NICE, OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

260
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:19,997
NOW, AT THIS TIME, IT'S MY
PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE,
Mr. DOUGIE "X"

261
00:13:20,064 --> 00:13:22,133
WHO HAS SOMETHING TO
SHARE WITH THE GROUP.

262
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:23,768
Mr. FRANKLIN --
OH, DARN.

263
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,671
THANK YOU, HAROLD.

264
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:30,407
RED, GENTLEMEN,

265
00:13:30,474 --> 00:13:34,645
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ME LAST
WEEK THAT I WOULD LIKE TO
SHARE WITH YOU.

266
00:13:34,712 --> 00:13:38,449
I CAME HOME FROM WORK ONE
NIGHT AND SETTLED IN FOR
A NIGHT OF TV.

267
00:13:38,516 --> 00:13:40,684
I HAD A DRINK IN THE CUP
HOLDER IN MY ARM REST;

268
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:46,190
I HAD MY LEBANESE HICKORY-SMOKED
BABAGANOUSH DIP ON MY LAP;

269
00:13:46,257 --> 00:13:49,593
HAD MY CHIPS TO MY LEFT, MY BAG
OF JUJUBES TO MY RIGHT

270
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,296
AND MY DING DONG IN
MY TOP POCKET.

271
00:13:52,363 --> 00:13:54,598
MY CHAIR WAS IN THE FULLY
RECLINED POSITION.

272
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:58,402
GENTLEMEN, I WAS IN
FOR THE DURATION.

273
00:13:58,469 --> 00:14:02,907
AND, THEN, IT HAPPENED ABOUT
HALFWAY THROUGH THE OPENING
THEME OF A TV SHOW.

274
00:14:02,973 --> 00:14:05,709
I REALIZED: PHANTOM PAINS,

275
00:14:05,776 --> 00:14:09,246
I DID NOT HAVE MY REMOTE.

276
00:14:09,313 --> 00:14:10,548
I LOOKED EVERYWHERE FOR IT...

277
00:14:10,614 --> 00:14:12,049
UNDER MY ARM,

278
00:14:12,116 --> 00:14:13,918
UNDER MY OTHER ARM,

279
00:14:13,984 --> 00:14:15,486
DOWN IN AMONGST THE SEAT.

280
00:14:15,552 --> 00:14:19,356
MY REMOTE WAS NOWHERE
TO BE FOUND.

281
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:23,961
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE,
GENTLEMEN, I WATCHED AN ENTIRE
HOUR OF TELEVISION

282
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:26,196
WITHOUT CHANGING THE
CHANNEL ONCE.

283
00:14:26,263 --> 00:14:28,866
(APPLAUSE)

284
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:31,502
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
EXCELLENT.

285
00:14:31,568 --> 00:14:34,538
EXCELLENT.
NICE.

286
00:14:34,605 --> 00:14:35,739
NOT EASY TO DO.

287
00:14:35,806 --> 00:14:37,541
WHAT SHOW DID YOU WATCH
FOR AN ENTIRE HOUR?

288
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:39,743
"BAYWATCH SALUTES THE THONG."

289
00:14:45,015 --> 00:14:48,786
ALL RIGHT, KIND OF GETTING
BACK TO BASICS ON THIS
ADVENTURE WITH BILL --

290
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:50,254
BACK TO GOOD OL' FISHIN'.

291
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,756
WELL, THAT'S QUITE A LURE
YOU'VE GOT THERE.

292
00:14:52,823 --> 00:14:54,558
WATCH IT, WATCH IT, WATCH IT.

293
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,727
GOT THE SHARP LITTLE
PRONGS ON IT.

294
00:14:56,794 --> 00:15:00,230
YOU KNOW, YOU GET OUT THERE BY
THE WATER, AND YOU JUST --

295
00:15:00,297 --> 00:15:01,165
OH, FEELING A BIT OF
TENSION, MAYBE.

296
00:15:01,231 --> 00:15:04,068
OH, OH, OH.

297
00:15:04,134 --> 00:15:07,237
CAUGHT ONE ON YOUR FIRST CAST.

298
00:15:07,304 --> 00:15:10,607
I WOULD THINK THAT THAT WOULD
SMART A LITTLE BIT.

299
00:15:10,674 --> 00:15:13,544
OH, YEAH, RIGHT THERE.
IT DIDN'T GO UP HIS NOSE,

300
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,747
SO I DON'T THINK IT
REQUIRES SURGERY.

301
00:15:16,814 --> 00:15:18,215
HAROLD, TAKE THAT OFF YOURSELF.

302
00:15:18,282 --> 00:15:19,716
HAROLD, DON'T LET HIM --
DON'T LET HIM DO IT.

303
00:15:19,783 --> 00:15:21,685
HAROLD, HAROLD, HAROLD --
DON'T LET HIM --

304
00:15:21,752 --> 00:15:25,689
HAROLD, HAROLD.

305
00:15:25,756 --> 00:15:27,524
I TRIED TO WARN YOU.

306
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:29,259
ALL RIGHT, OKAY, NO,
THAT'S FINE.

307
00:15:29,326 --> 00:15:31,328
THAT'S PART OF THE
BONDING EXPERIENCE.

308
00:15:31,395 --> 00:15:35,699
YOU GET A MAN WITH A YOUNGER
FELLA AND THEY JUST HAVE
A FUN TIME.

309
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:38,368
SEE, THOSE BAND-AIDS,
THEY DON'T HURT YOUR
APPEARANCE AT ALL.

310
00:15:38,435 --> 00:15:40,737
THOSE ARE CHICK MAGNETS,
THAT'S WHAT THOSE ARE.

311
00:15:40,804 --> 00:15:42,105
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT THAT.

312
00:15:42,172 --> 00:15:44,274
ALL RIGHT, A LITTLE LESSON...
THAT'S HOW YOU CAST.

313
00:15:44,341 --> 00:15:45,876
COME ON -- COME ON, BOYS.

314
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:47,811
NOW, DON'T...

315
00:15:47,878 --> 00:15:51,882
I KNEW IT.
I KNEW IT.
I KNEW IT.

316
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:54,484
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
THEY'RE ALL SET.

317
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:56,520
YOU GUYS FISHING WITH WORMS.

318
00:15:56,587 --> 00:15:57,854
LOOK AT THAT.
ISN'T THAT CUTE?

319
00:15:57,921 --> 00:16:00,257
COME ON, BILL,
PUT THAT ON THERE.

320
00:16:00,324 --> 00:16:03,026
COME ON. YOU DON'T KNOW HIM.

321
00:16:03,093 --> 00:16:05,729
OH, YOU TWO ARE PATHETIC.

322
00:16:05,796 --> 00:16:09,900
OH, OH, ALL RIGHT.

323
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:13,003
IS THE HOSPITAL CLOSE BY
TO THIS FISHING SPOT?

324
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,338
YEAH, YOU OWN THIS ONE, HAROLD.

325
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:16,006
JUST RIP 'ER OFF THERE.

326
00:16:16,073 --> 00:16:18,976
HA-HA-HA HO-HO-HO.
OH, I SHOULDN'T LAUGH.

327
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:20,644
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

328
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:22,179
SO THEY GOT THEIR WORMS
ON THE HOOK.

329
00:16:22,245 --> 00:16:25,182
THEY'RE HAPPY, HAPPY,
HAPPY, AREN'T THEY?

330
00:16:25,248 --> 00:16:26,350
UNBELIEVABLE.

331
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,085
OKAY, AWAY YOU GO, BOYS.

332
00:16:28,151 --> 00:16:32,756
AND, YEAH -- YEAH -- YEAH.

333
00:16:32,823 --> 00:16:35,125
WELL, YOU KNOW, I THINK THE
IMPORTANT THING IS THEY'RE
SPENDING THE DAY TOGETHER.

334
00:16:35,192 --> 00:16:37,027
THEY THINK THEY'VE
GOT SOMETHING.

335
00:16:37,094 --> 00:16:38,195
REEL 'ER IN, HAROLD.

336
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:39,363
GIVER 'ER A GOOD YANK.

337
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:39,997
YEAH -- YEAH -- YEAH.

338
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,235
OKAY, IT'S A POOR FISHERMAN
THAT EATS HIS BAIT, YOU KNOW?

339
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:46,470
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, HAROLD?

340
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:48,905
OH, OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

341
00:16:48,972 --> 00:16:50,273
DON'T WORRY, BILL WILL GET
THAT OUT OF THERE.

342
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,308
JUST POP THAT OUT
OF THERE, BILL.

343
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,744
OH, MY GOSH, OH, OH, OH, OH.

344
00:16:56,012 --> 00:16:57,948
HAROLD, WHY DON'T YOU GO OUT
AND GET A DRINK OR SOMETHING?

345
00:16:58,014 --> 00:16:59,249
RINSE THAT OUT.

346
00:16:59,316 --> 00:17:01,118
TAKE OFF. GET LOST.
BEAT IT.

347
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:02,953
MAN, THESE GUYS
ARE FRIGHTENING.

348
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:06,356
ALL RIGHT, BILL,
REEL 'ER IN, BILL.

349
00:17:06,423 --> 00:17:09,593
THAT'S RIGHT, IT'S A TREE.

350
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:10,961
DID YOU CATCH ONE, BILL?

351
00:17:11,027 --> 00:17:15,298
OH, OH, HE'S GOT A
LOVELY BASSWOOD.

352
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,802
HAROLD WILL HELP
YOU CLEAN THAT.

353
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:22,873
OH, OH, OH, THERE WE GO.

354
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:25,542
DON'T FORGET THE GILLS.

355
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,183
WELL, WE'VE DONE A TOTAL
RE-THINK ON THIS WHOLE
SMOKEHOUSE PROJECT THING.

356
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,417
WE'RE NOT GOING TO
BE ABLE TO SELL.

357
00:17:34,484 --> 00:17:36,019
THE REAL ESTATE
MARKET IS TOO SOFT.

358
00:17:36,086 --> 00:17:39,189
AND SO IS THE GROUND
UNDER THE SMOKEHOUSE,
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

359
00:17:39,256 --> 00:17:42,325
SO, INSTEAD, WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE A LOTTERY.

360
00:17:42,392 --> 00:17:44,394
NOBODY WANTS A SMOKEHOUSE.

361
00:17:44,461 --> 00:17:48,131
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BUY
TICKETS FOR A LOTTERY IF
THAT'S THE MAIN PRIZE.

362
00:17:49,566 --> 00:17:51,401
WELL, THAT'S NOT
THE MAIN PRIZE,

363
00:17:51,468 --> 00:17:53,336
Mr. JUMP-TO-CONCLUSIONS.

364
00:17:53,403 --> 00:17:55,472
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE
THE SMOKEHOUSE AWAY,

365
00:17:55,538 --> 00:17:58,942
WE'RE GOING TO BLOW IT UP.

366
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:02,212
THE WINNER GETS TO PRESS THE
BUTTON ON THE DETONATOR.

367
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:04,147
HOW MANY TICKETS CAN I SIGN
YOU UP FOR, THERE, HAROLD?

368
00:18:04,214 --> 00:18:05,148
NONE!

369
00:18:05,215 --> 00:18:07,117
I'M AGAINST THIS
COMPLETELY ON PRINCIPLE.

370
00:18:07,183 --> 00:18:09,019
THAT'S INCREDIBLE!
COME ON.

371
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:12,155
I'VE GOT A GOOD MIND TO GO
DOWN THERE AND CHAIN MYSELF
TO THE BUILDING.

372
00:18:12,222 --> 00:18:15,091
WELL, IT WOULD PROBABLY
HELP TICKET SALES.

373
00:18:15,158 --> 00:18:17,093
OH, COME ON, HAROLD.
IT'S NOT DANGEROUS.

374
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,597
THEY'VE RIGGED THE EXPLOSIVES
SO THE BUILDING JUST KIND OF
FALLS IN ON ITSELF.

375
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:23,199
UNCLE RED, IF WE'VE LEARNED
ANYTHING FROM THIS HISTORY
I'M TRYING TO PRESERVE,

376
00:18:23,266 --> 00:18:27,837
IT'S THAT SENSELESS
DESTRUCTION IS ROBBING
OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS
OF ITS BIRTHRIGHT.

377
00:18:27,904 --> 00:18:29,739
OKAY, FINE.

378
00:18:29,806 --> 00:18:33,910
BUT THAT SHOULDN'T INTERFERE
WITH MY RIGHT TO THE PURSUIT
OF HAPPINESS, HAROLD.

379
00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:36,012
WE HAVE LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY,

380
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:41,117
AND THESE LAWS ARE MEANT
TO GUARANTEE US THE GREATEST
FREEDOM IN THE WORLD, HAROLD.

381
00:18:41,184 --> 00:18:42,719
THAT'S OUR LEGACY.

382
00:18:42,786 --> 00:18:44,454
THAT'S OUR
GREAT TRADITION.

383
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:47,023
AND NOW, IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME,

384
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,793
I GOTTA GO BLOW
UP A BUILDING.

385
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:52,929
(APPLAUSE)

386
00:18:52,996 --> 00:18:55,131
THIS IS THE REPAIR SHOP PART
OF THE SHOW WE CALL,

387
00:18:55,198 --> 00:18:58,935
"IF IT AIN'T BROKE,
YOU'RE NOT TRYING."

388
00:18:59,002 --> 00:19:00,603
ARNIE DOGAN IS HERE WITH
SOMETHING FOR US TO FIX.

389
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,005
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
THERE, ARNIE?

390
00:19:02,071 --> 00:19:05,508
WELL, RED, I WAS
HOPING YOU COULD
FIX MY GUITAR.

391
00:19:05,575 --> 00:19:06,910
WELL, MAYBE. IT DOESN'T
LOOK TOO BAD.

392
00:19:06,976 --> 00:19:07,844
WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT?

393
00:19:07,911 --> 00:19:09,746
IT DOESN'T HAVE
ANY CHARACTER.

394
00:19:09,813 --> 00:19:13,216
ALL THE BIG STARS, THEY'VE
GOT GUITARS WITH CHARACTER.

395
00:19:13,283 --> 00:19:16,319
WILLIE NELSON,
HIS IS ALL HACKED UP.

396
00:19:16,386 --> 00:19:19,756
I HEARD HE HAD IT
SPECIALLY TUNED TO
HIS VOICE, EH?
OH, YEAH.

397
00:19:19,823 --> 00:19:24,527
AND THEN B.B. KING, HE NAMED HIS
GUITAR -- SPECIAL NAME -- HE
CALLS IT "LUCILLE."

398
00:19:24,594 --> 00:19:26,663
WELL, THEN, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
NAME YOUR GUITAR, ARNIE.

399
00:19:26,729 --> 00:19:28,698
I AM WAY AHEAD
OF YOU THERE, RED.

400
00:19:28,765 --> 00:19:31,868
I CALL IT "DOUG."

401
00:19:31,935 --> 00:19:35,271
YOU SEE, I WANT TO
GET AWAY FROM THAT
SEXIST THING.
YEAH.

402
00:19:35,338 --> 00:19:37,173
WELL, WHAT WOULD
YOU LIKE ME TO DO TO IT?

403
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,575
WELL, MAYBE JUST SCUFF
IT A LITTLE BIT.

404
00:19:38,641 --> 00:19:39,909
PUT SOME STICKERS ON IT.

405
00:19:39,976 --> 00:19:43,813
MAKE IT LOOK LIKE I'VE BEEN
ON THE ROAD TOURING WITH IT.

406
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,882
ALL RIGHT, WELL, WHY DON'T
YOU HANG ON OVER THERE,

407
00:19:45,949 --> 00:19:50,353
AND I'LL JUST DROP
THE BELT SANDER ON
HER A COUPLE OF TIMES.

408
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,155
AND HANG ON TO DOUG.
I GOT 'IM.

409
00:19:55,692 --> 00:19:59,796
OH DARN, OH BOY, OH BOY...

410
00:20:01,864 --> 00:20:04,200
OH, IT'S -- ARNIE...

411
00:20:04,267 --> 00:20:06,169
YOU KNOW, I THINK WE'VE DONE IT.

412
00:20:06,235 --> 00:20:10,340
IT SURE LOOKS LIKE
IT'S BEEN ON THE ROAD.

413
00:20:10,406 --> 00:20:13,009
DO YOU THINK IT'S MORE ME NOW?

414
00:20:13,076 --> 00:20:14,610
WELL, IT'S CERTAINLY
TUNED TO YOUR VOICE.

415
00:20:14,677 --> 00:20:17,080
IT'S FLAT.

416
00:20:17,146 --> 00:20:20,216
(APPLAUSE)

417
00:20:22,151 --> 00:20:29,125
(COUGHING)

418
00:20:29,192 --> 00:20:36,365
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

419
00:20:36,432 --> 00:20:41,237
WELL, NOW WE KNOW WHY THEY
CALL IT A SMOKEHOUSE.

420
00:20:41,304 --> 00:20:45,241
COULDA BEEN CALLED A FIREHOUSE
OR A FLYING-DEBRIS-HOUSE.

421
00:20:45,308 --> 00:20:47,310
WHAT THE HECK WENT WRONG
THERE, UNCLE RED?

422
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:49,278
WELL, EDGAR SET THE
CHARGES WRONG.

423
00:20:49,345 --> 00:20:51,414
YOU KNOW, WE WANTED AN
IMPLOSION; WE GOT AN EXPLOSION.

424
00:20:51,481 --> 00:20:54,217
HE FIGURED IT WAS A TYPO.

425
00:20:54,283 --> 00:20:55,985
I JUST FIGURED THE BUILDING
WAS GOING TO FALL OVER.

426
00:20:56,052 --> 00:20:59,388
I DIDN'T EXPECT THE ENTIRE
THING TO ROCKET OUT OF
THE GROUND LIKE THAT.

427
00:20:59,455 --> 00:21:01,257
YEAH, WELL, SEE, THAT'S
THAT OLD PLYWOOD. IT'S SOLID.

428
00:21:01,324 --> 00:21:02,725
I MEAN, SHE REALLY
HELD TOGETHER, EH?

429
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:05,628
OH, YEAH,
BONUS THERE.
YEAH.

430
00:21:05,695 --> 00:21:09,065
IT WAS WEIRD, THOUGH, SEEING
THIS ENTIRE BUILDING TUMBLING
ACROSS THE SKY.

431
00:21:09,131 --> 00:21:12,335
OVER OUR HEADS WHEN
IT MADE AN ECLIPSE
IT PASSED OVER.
YEAH.

432
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:14,203
I WAS AFRAID IT WAS GOING TO
COME DOWN ON THE MAIN ROAD,

433
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:18,174
BUT, LUCKILY, SHE CAUGHT A
FAVOURABLE WIND AND
HEADED INTO TOWN.

434
00:21:18,241 --> 00:21:20,610
WHAT BUILDING DID IT
ACTUALLY HIT DOWN THERE?

435
00:21:20,676 --> 00:21:23,846
THE HISTORICAL SOCIETY BUILDING.

436
00:21:23,913 --> 00:21:26,315
YEAH, THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT
CLOSING THE WHOLE PLACE DOWN.

437
00:21:26,382 --> 00:21:30,653
THEY FIGURED IT WAS BAD FOR
THEIR IMAGE IF THE HISTORICAL
SOCIETY CAN'T PRESERVE THEIR
OWN BUILDING.

438
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,055
WELL, THAT'S A SHAME.

439
00:21:33,122 --> 00:21:36,459
I GUESS I'LL JUST KIND OF HANG
ONTO THE CASH FROM THE TICKETS
THERE UNTIL THEY MAKE UP
THEIR MIND.

440
00:21:36,525 --> 00:21:38,060
(POSSUM CALL)

441
00:21:38,127 --> 00:21:39,762
MEETING TIME, UNCLE RED.

442
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:41,864
YOU GO AHEAD, HAROLD.
I'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.
OKAY.

443
00:21:41,931 --> 00:21:44,000
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

444
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:45,668
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

445
00:21:45,735 --> 00:21:48,104
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING,

446
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,672
AND NOW THAT WE'VE GOT NO
HISTORICAL SOCIETY,

447
00:21:49,739 --> 00:21:51,307
IF I'M THE OLD THING YOU'RE
TRYING TO PRESERVE,

448
00:21:51,374 --> 00:21:54,343
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO DO IT ALL ON YOUR OWN.

449
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,112
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

450
00:21:56,178 --> 00:21:58,681
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND HAROLD
AND THE WHOLE GANG UP HERE
AT THE LODGE,

451
00:21:58,748 --> 00:22:01,117
YOU KEEP YOUR STICK
ON THE ICE.

452
00:22:01,183 --> 00:22:03,552
(APPLAUSE)

454
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:14,697
Harold:  SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN.

455
00:22:15,831 --> 00:22:19,301
ALL RISE.

456
00:22:21,437 --> 00:22:24,540
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI.

457
00:22:24,607 --> 00:22:26,375
Red Green:  SIT DOWN.

458
00:22:26,442 --> 00:22:32,615
Harold:  OKAY THIS IS OUR
FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT...

459
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:35,785
THE ALLISTON BROTHERS HAVE BEEN
REMANDED 'TIL NEXT MONTH,

460
00:22:35,851 --> 00:22:37,319
AND JIMMY GRISSLE IS
OUT ON BAIL,

461
00:22:37,386 --> 00:22:39,221
AND JOEY FEATHERSTONE
GOT PROBATION,

462
00:22:39,288 --> 00:22:44,593
SO THE TEAM PHOTO FOR THE
POSSUM LAKE HOCKEY LEAGUE
IS ON FOR TONIGHT.

463
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,864
IF WE DON'T DO IT TONIGHT, IT
MIGHT BE 3-5 BEFORE EVERYONE'S
AVAILABLE AGAIN.
