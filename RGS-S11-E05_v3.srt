1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,200
THAT I ENJOY
A GAME OF GOLF.

2
00:00:04,266 --> 00:00:05,900
I THINK IT'S THE
IDEA OF BEING OUTDOORS

3
00:00:05,966 --> 00:00:07,700
WITH LOTS OF
WIDE OPEN SPACES

4
00:00:07,766 --> 00:00:10,100
AND A BAG FULL OF
ASSORTED WEAPONS.

5
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:13,066
AND WHEN IT'S FINALLY SPRING
AFTER A LONG COLD WINTER,

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,133
THE ITCH IS
PRETTY UNBEARABLE.

7
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:17,200
AND THE SAME
THING WITH GOLF.

8
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:22,366
BUT OF COURSE MANY OF US
WHO HAVE CHOSEN MARITAL BLISS
AS AN ALTERNATE LIFESTYLE

9
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:26,666
ARE NOT FREE TO GO GOLFING
UNTIL THE YARD IS
CLEANED UP

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,466
OF ALL THE WINTER
FLOTSAM AND JETSAM.

11
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,500
MEANWHILE MY NEIGHBOUR,

12
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:37,033
WHO OWNS THE PROPERTY ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT FENCE

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,333
AND IS A LESS SENSITIVE, MORE
CHAUVINISTIC KIND OF A GUY,

14
00:00:40,366 --> 00:00:43,200
HAS ALREADY TEED OFF,
IN, OH, SO MANY WAYS.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,600
HERE'S WHAT I DO.

16
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:49,333
BEFORE WINTER CAME I TIED
THIS TARP TO THAT SAME FENCE

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,700
AND I LAID THE TARP OVER
MY YARD TO CATCH ALL
THE WINTER CRAP.

18
00:00:53,766 --> 00:00:57,666
THEN I TIED THIS EDGE UP
TO AN OLD WORK SOCK HERE.

19
00:00:57,733 --> 00:01:01,466
ALL I GOTTA DO IS
DROP A GOLF BALL DOWN
INSIDE THE SOCK,

20
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:03,766
GET HER ALL THE
WAY DOWN TO THE TOE.

21
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,500
AND THEN I JUST
TEE HER UP NICE,

22
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:11,466
AND SUDDENLY MY ROUGH BECOMES
MY NEIGHBOUR'S FAIRWAY.

23
00:01:11,533 --> 00:01:12,866
FORE!

24
00:01:25,033 --> 00:01:30,266
[cheers and applause]

25
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,600
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

26
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,700
WELL, I APPRECIATE THAT.

27
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:44,333
KIND OF A DISTURBING WEEK UP
AT THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

28
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:46,933
WE'VE GOT A BIT OF A
CRIME WAVE GOING ON UP HERE.

29
00:01:46,966 --> 00:01:49,133
PETTY THEFT. ODDBALL STUFF.

30
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:52,833
ALL OF JUNIOR SINGLETON'S
LAWN ORNAMENTS WERE STOLEN.

31
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:56,800
HE'S GOT A BIG COLLECTION OF
THOSE FAT PEOPLE BENT OVER.

32
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,033
IT'S A REAL LANDMARK UP HERE.

33
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,900
SO NOW JUNIOR AND HIS WIFE
HAD TO SPEND THE WHOLE DAY

34
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:05,300
BENT OVER ON THEIR FRONT LAWN
JUST SO PEOPLE CAN FIND
THEIR WAY AROUND.

35
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:08,333
MR. GREEN,

36
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,233
WE'RE GETTING A
GIFT FOR DALTON,

37
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,666
AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU'D
BE WILLING TO CHIP IN?

38
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,166
WELL, WHAT'S THE GIFT?
WHAT'S THE GIFT FOR?

39
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,833
AND HOW MUCH IS
IT GONNA COST ME?

40
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,333
ANSWER THE
LAST ONE FIRST.

41
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,966
FIVE BUCKS.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,800
ALL RIGHT,
GO ON.

43
00:02:21,866 --> 00:02:24,300
OKAY, WELL, DALTON'S GOT,
LIKE, A BIG BIRTHDAY
COMING UP,

44
00:02:24,366 --> 00:02:26,600
AND WE THOUGHT WE'D GET
HIM, LIKE, A SPECIAL GIFT.

45
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:28,666
ONLY IT'S A SURPRISE,

46
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,633
SO WE DON'T WANT
HIM TO KNOW ABOUT.

47
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,100
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND THE
BASIC CONCEPT OF A
SURPRISE, MIKE.

48
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:35,800
SURE YOU CAN PUT ME
DOWN FOR FIVE BUCKS.

49
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,666
AH, GEE,
THANKS A LOT, MR. GREEN.

50
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,233
I GOT THIS REALLY GREAT DEAL
ON THIS REAL SPECIAL BARBECUE.

51
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,933
IF I GET 20 GUYS TO
COUGH UP FIVE BUCKS EACH,

52
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:44,533
THEN WE'RE THERE.

53
00:02:44,566 --> 00:02:47,633
JUST YOU.
YOU GOT SO FAR?
WELL, HOW MANY DO

54
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,700
WHAT ABOUT
YOURSELF?

55
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:52,900
OH, SURE,
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

56
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:56,800
OH, GOTTA GO.
MUM'S THE WORD.

57
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,133
HEY!
WHAT'S GOING ON?

58
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,966
WHAT?
NOTHING.

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,300
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S
ANYBODY'S BIRTHDAY
OR ANYTHING.

60
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,500
I'M TALKING
ABOUT THEFT, RED.

61
00:03:08,566 --> 00:03:10,766
YEAH, SOMEBODY BROKE
INTO MY STORE

62
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,866
AND TOOK THE DELUXE
BARBECUE OUT OF THE
WINDOW DISPLAY.

63
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:19,766
HOLY SMOKES, I DON'T
THINK I'M EVER GOING
TO GET THAT BACK.

64
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,400
WELL, NOW, YOU
JUST MIGHT, DALTON.

65
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,733
IT'S TIME FOR THE
POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

66
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,966
[cheers and applause]

67
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:43,666
AND TODAY THE
WINNER WILL GET

68
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:45,766
12,000 GALLONS OF
BUNKER "C" CRUDE OIL,

69
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,700
TO BE PICKED UP AT
YOUR CONVENIENCE.

70
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:52,333
THE OIL IS CURRENTLY FLOATING
AT THE NORTH END OF
POSSUM LAKE.

71
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,133
GOOD. GOOD.

72
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,733
CLOSE YOUR EARS.

73
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:58,233
HAROLD, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO GET YOUR UNCLE RED
TO SAY THIS WORD...

74
00:04:03,566 --> 00:04:04,900
AND GO!

75
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:07,633
OKAY, OKAY, UNCLE RED,
WHAT DO YOU CALL A PERSON

76
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,800
WHO'S NEVER HAD ANY
FORM OF SEXUAL ACTIVITY?

77
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:12,966
HAROLD.

78
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,900
COME ON. COME ON.
HERE FOR THIS, YOU KNOW!
I DON'T HAVE TO BE

79
00:04:15,966 --> 00:04:18,433
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
NO, IT'S NOT A NAME.

80
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,033
BUT IT IS A DESCRIPTIVE
WORD FOR SOMEONE WHO
DOESN'T HAVE SEX.

81
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,033
UGLY.

82
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,900
NO. NO. NO.

83
00:04:24,966 --> 00:04:27,566
THIS IS A PART OF
SOMEONE'S LIFE

84
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:30,366
WHERE THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN INTIMATE CONTACT.

85
00:04:30,433 --> 00:04:32,700
DEATH?

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,266
NO. NO.

87
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,200
OKAY, IT'S A DECISION
THEY MAKE,

88
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:41,100
AND THEY SAY, NO SEXUAL
ACTIVITY FOR ME,
BECAUSE I'M...

89
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:43,233
MARRIED.

90
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:50,633
NO.
OKAY, MOST RELIGIOUS
WORKERS ARE THIS.

91
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,733
TAX EXEMPT?

92
00:04:52,766 --> 00:04:55,233
TAX EXEMPT?
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN
THINK TAX EXEMPT!?

93
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:58,066
OKAY, OKAY.
TIME'S ALMOST UP.

94
00:04:58,133 --> 00:05:02,533
UNCLE RED, WHAT DO YOU
DO DURING TROUT SEASON

95
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,366
TO EARN EXTRA MONEY?

96
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,200
SELL BAIT?

97
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:08,500
OH, COME ON!

98
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,366
WHEN THE FUMES HAVE MELTED
YOUR PATIO CHAIRS

99
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:19,400
'CAUSE YOUR LAWN
IS A TOXIC SPILL,

100
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:21,566
WHEN YOU BREATHE IT BURNS
ALL YOUR NOSTRIL HAIRS

101
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,266
AND MAKES YOUR
PET SKUNK ILL,

102
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,233
WHEN YOUR SEPTICS HAVE YOU
AT THE END OF YOUR ROPE,

103
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:27,133
CALL US, THE PEOPLE
WITH SKILL.

104
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,233
WITH ROTHSCHILD'S YOU KNOW
YOU ALWAYS HAVE HOPE,

105
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,100
'CAUSE WE CAN TAKE IT,
AND WE WILL.

106
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,633
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE GREAT
FRUSTRATIONS IN LIFE

107
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,966
IS WANTING THINGS
YOU CAN'T HAVE.

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,300
LIKE, A CURE FOR A FATAL
DISEASE OR WORLD PEACE

109
00:05:40,366 --> 00:05:43,666
OR HAVING YOUR OWN
AUTOMATIC GARAGE DOOR OPENER.

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,900
WELL, I'VE GOT GREAT
NEWS FOR YOU.

111
00:05:45,966 --> 00:05:49,533
THIS TIME I'M GONNA SHOW YOU
HOW TO BUILD YOUR OWN
GARAGE DOOR OPENER.

112
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,566
ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS TAKE OFF
THESE BIG SPRINGS.

113
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:55,833
THESE SPRINGS HOLD
THE DOOR OPEN,

114
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,533
BUT YOU DON'T WANT THAT.

115
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,300
YOU WANT THE DOOR
TO STAY CLOSED.

116
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:02,566
OKAY, GOOD.
NO, THAT'S GOOD.

117
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:05,166
ALL RIGHT, NOW, I'VE ATTACHED
ONE END OF A CHUNK OF ROPE

118
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,733
TO THE TOP OF
MY GARAGE DOOR.

119
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,900
SO WHEN THE ROPE IS PULLED,
THE DOOR WILL OPEN.

120
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:14,400
OKAY, NEXT WE JUST NEED
A PULLEY OF SOME KIND.

121
00:06:14,466 --> 00:06:16,066
OH, THERE WE GO.

122
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:17,833
I'LL JUST THREAD THE
OTHER END OF THE ROPE

123
00:06:17,866 --> 00:06:20,166
THROUGH ONE OF THE RIMS
ON MY OLD BIKE.

124
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:22,000
SEE, THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF
NEVER THROWING ANYTHING OUT.

125
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:24,800
NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU'RE
GOING TO NEED IT AGAIN.

126
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:28,166
I BET BERNICE HAS TRIED A
MILLION TIMES TO TO GET
RID OF THAT BIKE.

127
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:30,233
SHE SHOULD SEE THIS.

128
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:32,200
BERNICE!

129
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,066
BERNICE.

130
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:38,800
NEVER MIND.

131
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,533
OKAY, NOW WE'RE
GETTING THERE.

132
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,433
SO AS SOON AS ANYTHING
PULLS ON THE ROPE,

133
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,833
THE DOOR OPENS.

134
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,066
OKAY, NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS RUN IT AROUND SOMETHING
STRONG AND SMOOTH,

135
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:53,600
AND I DON'T MEAN A GLASS
OF SINGLE-MALT WHISKEY.

136
00:06:53,633 --> 00:06:57,066
I'M TALKING ABOUT A POLE
OR A FIRE HYDRANT

137
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,466
OR AN IMBEDDED MISSILE
OF SOME KIND.

138
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,166
THEN YOU RUN THE ROPE
ACROSS THE DRIVEWAY

139
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:06,133
AT ABOUT
WINDSHIELD HEIGHT.

140
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,533
THAT OUGHTA KEEP THE
SNOWMOBILERS OUTTA THERE.

141
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,500
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GIVE
HER A TRY.

142
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,266
OKAY, NOW, YOU WANNA GET
YOURSELF A CAR WITH A
POWER ANTENNA.

143
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,033
IF YOU DON'T HAVE
ONE OF THOSE,

144
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,866
YOU PROBABLY LIVE IN A DUMP
THAT DOESN'T HAVE A
GARAGE ANYWAY.

145
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:26,700
SO REMEMBER IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

146
00:07:26,766 --> 00:07:29,033
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

147
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,666
Red: BERNICE!

148
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:55,300
[applause]

149
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,166
YOU KNOW, A LOT
OF US MIDDLE-AGED
GUYS ARE PRETTY RUGGED.

150
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,600
WE DON'T COMPLAIN IF WE NAIL
A FINGER TO THE WORKBENCH,

151
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:12,533
OR MAYBE TAKE A
FLYING TIRE IN THE FACE.

152
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,366
EVEN SHOOT OFF
THE OCCASIONAL TOE.

153
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:18,933
BUT IF WE GET A COLD
OR THE FLU,

154
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:22,566
WE GO DOWN LIKE A
CHEAP LAWN CHAIR.

155
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,700
NOW, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

156
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:27,833
THIS IS PART OF THE MANLY
ART OF BEING MANLY.

157
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,300
YOU SEE, MOST MEN LIKE
TO PRETEND THEY'RE
INDESTRUCTIBLE.

158
00:08:31,366 --> 00:08:33,666
AND IT STOPS THEM
FROM SAYING THINGS LIKE,

159
00:08:33,733 --> 00:08:37,033
I CAN'T LIFT MY
END OF THE PIANO;

160
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:40,933
OR, I DON'T WANNA GO
UP ON THE ROOF;

161
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,433
OR, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I'VE USED AN ARC WELDER.

162
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:49,000
YOU SEE, IT'S MEN LIKE ME
WHO CAN'T ASK FOR HELP

163
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:51,533
THAT CREATES MOST
OF THE PROBLEMS.

164
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,833
THAT'S WHY WE LET A COLD
BRING US TO OUR KNEES.

165
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,866
WE KNOW A COLD
IS NO BIG DEAL,

166
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:58,733
BUT WE FIGURE IF WE CAN SAY,
HEY, I NEED HELP,

167
00:08:58,766 --> 00:09:00,900
WHEN WE DON'T
REALLY NEED HELP,

168
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:03,533
THEN MAYBE WE WON'T HAVE
TO SAY, HEY, I NEED HELP,

169
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:05,800
WHEN WE REALLY
DO NEED HELP.

170
00:09:05,866 --> 00:09:09,066
I'LL TELL YOU IF MIDDLE-AGED
MEN COULD GET HELP WITHOUT
ASKING FOR IT,

171
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,766
THERE'D BE A LOT MORE OF
US SITTING AT HOME FEELING
BETTER ABOUT OURSELVES

172
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,900
AND A LOT FEWER OF US SITTING
IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM

173
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:18,000
TRYING TO COME UP WITH
AN EXPLANATION.

174
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:19,800
REMEMBER I'M
PULLING FOR YOU.

175
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,900
WE'RE ALL IN
THIS TOGETHER.

176
00:09:21,966 --> 00:09:24,166
[applause]

177
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:31,300
[film projector running]

178
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:36,000
OH, HI, EVERYBODY.
RANGER GORD HERE.

179
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,966
WELCOME TO THE EDUCATIONAL
PORTION OF THE SHOW

180
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:40,700
AND THE ONLY SEGMENT
OF THIS PROGRAMME

181
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:45,200
THAT HAS ANY REAL LASTING
VALUE IN THE PUREST SENSE.

182
00:09:45,233 --> 00:09:48,766
I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT
ANOTHER IN MY SERIES
OF ANIMATED SHORTS.

183
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,300
AND YOU KNOW, BEING ALONE
IN THE FIRE TOWER FOR AS
LONG AS I'VE BEEN,

184
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:55,000
THERE'S NOTHING I LIKE
MORE THAN ANIMATED SHORTS.

185
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:57,433
[laughter]

186
00:09:57,466 --> 00:10:00,300
TRUST ME.

187
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,433
ANYWAY, TODAY'S FILM IS
ALL ABOUT BEING READY.

188
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,466
SO ARE YOU READY NOW?

189
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,600
NO?

190
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,933
[whistling]

191
00:10:22,966 --> 00:10:24,133
HOW ABOUT NOW?

192
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,300
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

193
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:30,433
[quirky upbeat music]

194
00:10:46,566 --> 00:10:49,366
TODAY I'M GOING TO TEACH
EVERYONE IN THE WORLD
ABOUT PREPARATION.

195
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,066
DO YOU TWO KNOW
WHAT PREPARATION IS?

196
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,166
SURE, I BELIEVE IT'S THAT
MEDICINE THAT COMES IN A TUBE.

197
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,666
YOU KNOW, UNCLE RED, NOT
EVERYTHING RANGER GORD SAYS

198
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:02,833
IS JUST A SET-UP
FOR A CHEAP JOKE.

199
00:11:02,866 --> 00:11:06,166
HAROLD IS RIGHT.
THIS IS NO JOKE.

200
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:09,033
PREPARATION IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING IN LIFE.

201
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:12,700
WELL, OTHER THAN WOMEN
AND DRY UNDERWEAR.

202
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:16,933
THE BOY SCOUTS HAVE A MOTTO,
"BE READY."

203
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:20,066
I THINK IT'S
"BE PREPARED."

204
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:21,666
I THINK.

205
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:23,133
WHO CARES WHAT
YOU THINK, HAROLD?

206
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,733
HERE, LET ME SHOW YOU.

207
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:40,133
ARE YOU READY?

208
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,366
UH, I THINK SO.

209
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:47,866
I WASN'T TAKING TO YOU.

210
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,633
[laughs]

211
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,433
SEE HOW THAT WORKS?

212
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:53,133
FOLLOW ME.

213
00:11:58,033 --> 00:11:59,666
YOU KNOW, HAROLD,
AS A FOREST RANGER,

214
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:02,666
I HAVE TO BE READY AT ALL
TIMES FOR ANY EMERGENCY.

215
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,533
YOU KNOW, I GUESS YOU COULD
SAY I'M A SUPER EL PRIMO
BOY SCOUT.

216
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,433
UH, NO,
I COULDN'T SAY THAT.

217
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,433
I KNOW YOU THINK FOREST
RANGERS ARE ONLY HERE TO
PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT.

218
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,300
BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE
TO IT THAN THAT.

219
00:12:26,366 --> 00:12:28,733
YEAH, YOU HAVE TO ALSO
BE A WEIRDO.

220
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,666
NO, THAT'S NOT CORRECT.

221
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:33,633
BEING A WEIRDO IS
COMPLETELY OPTIONAL.

222
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,766
BUT A FOREST RANGER DOES
NEED TO BE READY

223
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,666
FOR ANYTHING.

224
00:12:42,766 --> 00:12:45,633
AH! WERE YOU READY FOR
THIS, RANGER GORD?

225
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,366
ABSOLUTELY!

226
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,433
DON'T TELL ME THE SUPER
EL PRIMO BOY SCOUT
CAN FLY.

227
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,533
NOPE,
DON'T NEED TO.

228
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,933
HEY, THAT'S NOT FAIR!

229
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,200
YOU'RE RIGHT.

230
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,166
WHAT DO WE DO NOW, GORD?

231
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,066
TRY THIS.

232
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,100
[screaming]

233
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,466
[screaming]

234
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:25,466
[laughing]

235
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:29,266
[quirky upbeat music]

236
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,000
[applause]

237
00:13:34,866 --> 00:13:36,866
WELL, THE CRIME
WAVE CONTINUES.

238
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,966
MOOSE THOMPSON HAD HIS LAUNDRY
STOLEN RIGHT OFF HIS
CLOTHESLINE.

239
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:42,366
NOW, THAT'S GOTTA
BE VANDALISM.

240
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,566
THERE'S NOBODY AROUND HERE
BIG ENOUGH TO WEAR
HIS CLOTHES,

241
00:13:45,633 --> 00:13:47,900
UNLESS MAYBE THE
CIRCUS IS IN TOWN.

242
00:13:50,866 --> 00:13:53,200
HEY, MR. GREEN!
HEY!

243
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,800
HAVE A LOOK AT
THIS BARBECUE WE'RE
GIVING TO DALTON.

244
00:13:55,866 --> 00:13:57,766
OH, YEAH.
OR WHAT?
IS IT A BEAUTY

245
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,366
AND GET A LOAD OF
THE PRICE,

246
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:02,133
100 BUCKS.
HOW CAN YOU BEAT THAT?

247
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,866
YEAH, THAT'S A
REAL STEAL.

248
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:06,466
GO AHEAD, OPEN IT UP.
TAKE A LOOK.

249
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:09,566
NO, I DON'T WANNA PUT MY
FINGERPRINTS ON IT, MIKE.

250
00:14:09,633 --> 00:14:12,700
YEAH, WE GOTTA KEEP IT
NICE FOR DALTON.

251
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:15,966
CAN I HIDE IT IN HERE
UNTIL DALTON'S BIRTHDAY?

252
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,866
HE'D NEVER THINK TO LOOK
IN THE LODGE FOR ANYTHING.

253
00:14:19,933 --> 00:14:24,866
YOU KNOW, MIKE, I HATE
TO ASK YOU THIS,

254
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,700
BUT IS THAT
BARBECUE HOT?

255
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:30,633
OH, YEAH, IT GOES
UP TO 500 DEGREES!

256
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,566
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEAN.

257
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,100
I MEAN DID YOU STEAL
THAT BARBECUE?

258
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:39,633
MR. GREEN, WHAT MUST
YOU THINK OF ME?

259
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,766
WE DON'T HAVE
TIME FOR THAT, MIKE.

260
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,133
DID YOU STEAL
THE BARBECUE?

261
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,133
ABSOLUTELY NOT,

262
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:49,000
AND I'M DISGUSTED THAT
YOU WOULD EVEN THINK
SUCH A THING!

263
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:51,033
WELL, I APOLOGIZE.

264
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:55,000
IT'S JUST THAT WHEN A GUY
GOES TO JAIL 37 TIMES
FOR THEFT,

265
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:58,600
WELL, A PERSON CAN JUMP
TO CONCLUSIONS.

266
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:05,300
HIYA, DALTON.
HOW YOU DOIN'?

267
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:08,200
WELL, THERE'S STILL NO
SIGN OF THAT MISSING
BARBECUE.

268
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:10,300
I PHONED THE POLICE,
GAVE THEM A COMPLETE
DESCRIPTION.

269
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,500
YEAH, IT'S GOT A NICE HOOD
ON IT, ENAMELED GREEN.

270
00:15:12,566 --> 00:15:15,266
A LITTLE SHELF ON EACH
SIDE WITH A BURNER.

271
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,766
IT'S A
BEAUTIFUL THING.

272
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,233
YEAH, I CAN ALMOST
PICTURE IT.

273
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:21,633
$1200, RED!

274
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:27,433
BOY, THE GUY THAT'S GOT
THAT IS GOING TO SPEND
A LONG TIME IN JAIL.

275
00:15:27,466 --> 00:15:29,166
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT'S THAT?

276
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:32,166
IT'S NOT A BARBECUE IF
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
THINKING.

277
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,466
NO, THERE'S SOMETHING
JUST WEIRD,

278
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,233
NOT QUITE RIGHT.
WHAT -- WHAT --

279
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,066
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I CLEANED.

280
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:39,966
I CLEANED, DALTON,
AND I PAINTED.

281
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,433
THAT'S ALL WET PAINT.
YOU DON'T WANNA GET WET
PAINT ON YOU, DALTON.

282
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,833
IT DOESN'T LOOK WET.
IT LOOKS DUSTY.

283
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,300
THAT'S THE COLOUR.
DUSTY BROWN.

284
00:15:46,366 --> 00:15:48,000
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?
IT'S THE FUMES,

285
00:15:48,033 --> 00:15:49,566
THE DUSTY BROWN
PAINT FUMES.

286
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:52,200
REMEMBER DUSTY SPRINGFIELD?
WASN'T SHE GREAT, EH?

287
00:15:52,266 --> 00:15:54,833
SHE'S GREAT.
LET'S GO.

288
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,500
Red: WINSTON AND I WERE
BLOWING UP BALLOONS
FOR A PARTY,

289
00:15:57,533 --> 00:15:59,100
AND I WAS HAVING PROBLEMS.

290
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,933
HE OBVIOUSLY HAS A LITTLE
MORE WIND THAN I DO.

291
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,766
AND HE WAS KINDA RAZZING ME
ON IT AND EVERYTHING,

292
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,300
WHICH I DIDN'T
APPRECIATE TOO MUCH.

293
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,133
NEXT THING YOU KNOW
THERE'S A BEE.

294
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,566
I DON'T LIKE THE BEES 'CAUSE
THEY CAN MAKE YOU SWELL UP
AND EVERYTHING.

295
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,200
I KIND DIRECTED HIM OVER --
OH! THERE YOU GO.

296
00:16:11,266 --> 00:16:13,333
NOW WHO'S THE
FUNNY ONE, HUH?

297
00:16:13,366 --> 00:16:15,366
I'M LOOKING AT THE BEE,
I'M THINKING --

298
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,566
OH, THERE HE IS.
I KNEW THERE'D BE
A HIVE AROUND THERE.

299
00:16:17,633 --> 00:16:19,900
I'M JUST MORE COMFORTABLE
GETTING IT OUT OF THERE.

300
00:16:19,933 --> 00:16:22,066
WE CAN TAKE THE STEP LADDER
OVER AND TAKE A BURLAP BAG

301
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,266
AND JUST GO ON UP AND THAT.

302
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,466
AND I THINK IT'S SAFER
IF YOU GO UP, WINSTON.

303
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,000
THEN I CAN HOLD THE LADDER.

304
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:32,133
SO WINSTON GETS UP
THERE AND --

305
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,666
YEAH, AWAY YOU GO.
YOU'RE FINE.

306
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:35,666
NO, YOU'RE FINE.
YOU'RE FINE.

307
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,933
THE PROBLEM THERE IS
HE'S JUST NóT QUITE TALL
ENOUGH TO GET TO THE HIVE,

308
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,933
AND THAT'S THE
ONLY LADDER WE'VE GOT,

309
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,033
SO I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.

310
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,200
AND THAT GOT HIM UP,
AND HE GOT THE HIVE.

311
00:16:46,233 --> 00:16:48,733
AND HE GOT IN THE BAG,
AND THEN HE DROPPED
THE WHOLE UNIT.

312
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:52,833
I COULDN'T HANG AROUND.

313
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,400
SO THEN THE BEES ARE
FLYING INSIDE THE BAG.

314
00:16:56,466 --> 00:16:58,466
THE WHOLE THING HAS
TAKEN OFF THERE.

315
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:00,533
FIRST THING I GOTTA DO
IS BRING WINSTON BACK
DOWN TO EARTH,

316
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,733
WHICH IS A BIG JOB
ALL ON ITS OWN.

317
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:04,500
AND THEN I THOUGHT,
WELL, YOU KNOW,

318
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,266
I'VE GOT THE FISHING GEAR.

319
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,066
IF THAT THING IS FLOATING
AROUND THROUGH THE SKY,

320
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:12,633
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO JUST,
UH, GET A GOOD LURE.

321
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,166
I'M USUALLY PRETTY GOOD
WITH THIS THING.

322
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,466
AND JUST, UH, REEL BACK,
AND ONE GOOD CAST...

323
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:20,433
AND GOT HER!
GOT HER.

324
00:17:20,466 --> 00:17:22,100
ALL RIGHT, NOW
JUST REEL HER IN.

325
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:24,066
GENTLE.
THAT'S ONLY A
10-POUND TEST ON THERE.

326
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:25,600
I DON'T KNOW HOW
MUCH THESE BEES W --

327
00:17:25,633 --> 00:17:28,100
BUT YOU KNOW, WHAT CAME
DOWN WAS REALLY JUST
THE EMPTY BAG.

328
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:30,433
AND NOW I'M WONDERING DOES
THE HIVE FLOAT UP IN THE SKY

329
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,100
OR WILL IT DROP?

330
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:33,800
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER --
DOES IT DROP OR --

331
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,533
I'M NOT SURE WHAT
WOULD HAPPEN NEXT.

332
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,100
YEAH. YEAH.

333
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,233
NOW, I'VE HEARD OF A PERSON
WITH A BEE IN THEIR BONNET,

334
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:43,266
BUT WINSTON WENT
TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL.

335
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:48,066
[applause]

336
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:53,733
I'M NOT A BIG FAN
OF SMALL CARS.

337
00:17:53,766 --> 00:17:56,333
I KNOW THEY'RE CHEAPER
ON GAS AND EASIER TO PARK,

338
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,933
BUT YOU FEEL LIKE SUCH
A WEENIE DRIVING THEM.

339
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,900
AND YOU CAN ONLY RUN INTO
SMALL THINGS WITHOUT
HURTING YOURSELF.

340
00:18:01,933 --> 00:18:03,533
I'LL TELL YOU THE WORST
PART ABOUT A SMALL CAR,

341
00:18:03,566 --> 00:18:04,966
THE HORN.

342
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:07,133
NO INTIMIDATION
FACTOR AT ALL.

343
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,700
IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY
STEPPING ON A FROG.

344
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:12,066
HERE'S A BETTER IDEA.

345
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,133
GO DOWN TO YOUR LOCAL AUTO
WRECKERS AND PICK OUT

346
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,666
AS MANY WORKING CAR HORNS
AS YOU CAN GET YOUR HANDS ON.

347
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:20,733
THEN YOU MOUNT 'EM IN ANY
OPEN SPACE UNDER THE HOOD.

348
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,466
AND BELIEVE ME, WITH AN
ENGINE THE SIZE OF AN
ELECTRIC RAZOR,

349
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:25,766
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
PLENTY OF ROOM.

350
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,066
THE OTHER CARS MAY
NOT SEE YOU COMING;

351
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,766
THEY MAY NOT EVEN CARE
IF YOU'RE COMING;

352
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,300
BUT I PROMISE YOU ONE THING,
[chuckles]

353
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:34,866
THEY'LL HEAR YOU COMING.

354
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:39,066
JUST BE SURE YOU START HER
UP BEFORE YOU HONK THE HORN.

355
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,766
OTHERWISE, YOUR BATTERY
WILL DIE FASTER

356
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,600
THAN A BLOND JOKE AT
THE MISS AMERICA PAGEANT.

357
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,433
AND IT'S JUST THAT EASY.

358
00:18:45,466 --> 00:18:47,700
REMEMBER, HONK IF YOU
HATE NOISE POLLUTION.

359
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:49,600
[honk!]

360
00:18:49,633 --> 00:18:52,600
[applause]

361
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,133
MIKE HAS PUT US IN A
TERRIBLE POSITION HERE.

362
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,533
I'M GLAD TO GET DALTON
A BIRTHDAY GIFT,

363
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,966
BUT BOY, NOT WORTH GOING
TO JAIL FOR, EH?

364
00:19:04,033 --> 00:19:06,366
NOT FOR A LOUSY
BARBECUE ANYWAY.

365
00:19:06,433 --> 00:19:07,766
GET READY.
HE'S HERE!

366
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,533
WINSTON'S
BRINGING HIM IN.

367
00:19:16,033 --> 00:19:19,066
WHERE ARE THE
EXOTIC DANCERS?

368
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,600
DALTON, WE BROUGHT YOU
HERE FOR A SPECIAL
SURPRISE.

369
00:19:22,633 --> 00:19:24,233
EXOTIC DANCERS?

370
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,700
NO, DALTON.
WE KNOW IT'S
YOUR BIRTHDAY,

371
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:31,533
SO WE GOT YOU
A SPECIAL PRESENT.

372
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,566
WELL, EVEN ONE EXOTIC
DANCER WOULD BE FINE.

373
00:19:33,633 --> 00:19:35,433
DALTON!

374
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:38,800
MR. GREEN, WOULD YOU
DO THE HONOURS?

375
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:43,066
DALTON, WE GOT TOGETHER
AND WE GOT THIS FOR YOU.

376
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,333
AND WANNA WISH YOU
A HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

377
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,800
WOW!
WHAT IS THAT?

378
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,933
I DON'T KNOW.

379
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,666
WELL, IT'S
A BARBECUE.

380
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,333
IT'S A
BARBECUE!

381
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,300
IT'S A YELLOW
BARBECUE.

382
00:20:14,366 --> 00:20:16,366
OH, THAT IS SO NICE.

383
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,966
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T NEED A BARBECUE.

384
00:20:19,033 --> 00:20:21,100
REMEMBER THE ONE THAT WAS
STOLEN FROM THE WINDOW
OF MY STORE?

385
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:22,533
YEAH?

386
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:25,066
WELL, IT TURNS OUT
ANN MARIE HID IT

387
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:27,600
TO GIVE IT TO ME
FOR MY BIRTHDAY.

388
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:28,833
[laughs]

389
00:20:28,866 --> 00:20:30,666
BOY, IT'S A
BEAUT TOO.

390
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:32,333
[possum squealing]

391
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,833
OH, MEETING
TIME.

392
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,200
YEAH, YOU GUYS
GO AHEAD.

393
00:20:35,266 --> 00:20:36,966
OKAY.
RIGHT DOWN.
I'LL BE

394
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,866
SO IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

395
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,366
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT
HOME AFTER THE MEETING,

396
00:20:57,433 --> 00:21:00,100
AND I WAS REMINDED TONIGHT
OF OUR DATING YEARS,

397
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:04,300
BECAUSE MIKE WAS LOOKING AT
ME EXACTLY THE WAY YOUR
DAD USED TO.

398
00:21:04,366 --> 00:21:06,266
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

399
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,600
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND
THE WHOLE GANG UP HERE
AT THE LODGE,

400
00:21:09,633 --> 00:21:11,733
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

401
00:21:11,766 --> 00:21:14,600
[cheers and applause]

402
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:17,133
Winston
GUYS, GUYS, SIT DOWN.
COME TO ORDER.

403
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,366
ALL RISE!

404
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:28,600
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI.

405
00:21:28,633 --> 00:21:31,366
Red: SIT DOWN.

406
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:34,233
ALL RIGHT, MEN, BOW YOUR
HEADS FOR THE MEN'S PRAYER.

407
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,433
I'M A MAN,
BUT I CAN CHANGE,

408
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:40,666
IF I HAVE TO,
I GUESS.

409
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,400
I'M SORRY,
ALL RIGHT?

410
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:50,666
