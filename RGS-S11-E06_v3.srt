1
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:05,805
AND YOU NEED
TO LOOK AT THE MAP,

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,208
BUT MAYBE IT BLEW
OUT THE SUN ROOF?

3
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:10,643
OR IT'S STUCK TO
THE FLOOR IN THE AFTERMATH

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,380
OF SOME TYPE OF
A BEVERAGE SPILL?

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,081
WELL, HERE'S A BETTER IDEA.

6
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:20,820
DUCT TAPE THE MAP RIGHT
TO THE HOOD OF THE CAR.

7
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,823
THAT WAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW WHERE
IT IS WHEN YOU WANNA FIND IT.

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,026
I GUESS ANOTHER SOLUTION
WOULD BE TO STOP AND
ASK FOR DIRECTIONS.

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,697
[chuckle]
I DON'T SEE THAT
HAPPENING IN MY LIFETIME.

10
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:34,501
OKAY, LET'S GIVE HER A TRY.

11
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:36,836
FIRST THING, YOU HEAD
OUT ON YOUR TRIP.

12
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,211
THEN WHEN YOU WANNA
CHECK YOUR MAP,

13
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:47,280
YOU JUST PULL
ON THE HOOD RELEASE.

14
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:04,264
[cheering and applause]

15
00:01:09,535 --> 00:01:10,837
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,009
I APPRECIATE THAT.

17
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:19,312
WELL, I JUST GOT A CLEAN BILL
OF HEALTH FROM THE DOCTOR.

18
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:21,147
WELL, I DIDN'T ACTUALLY
GO TO THE DOCTOR.

19
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,383
I WAS TESTING MY BLOOD
PRESSURE ON ONE OF
THOSE MACHINES.

20
00:01:23,449 --> 00:01:25,852
I PUSHED THE BUTTON, AND THING
JUST KEPT GETTING TIGHTER

21
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:27,954
AND TIGHTER AND TIGHTER...

22
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:31,124
SO FINALLY I JUST YELL OUT,
AND THE PHARMACIST COMES OVER
AND UNPLUGS THE MACHINE,

23
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:32,692
BUT SHE DOESN'T
LOOSEN IT OFF AT ALL.

24
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,595
SO THEN THEY CALLED 911.
A COUPLE OF PARAMEDICS
COME OVER.

25
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,497
ONE OF THEM HAD
TO CUT THE THING OFF.

26
00:01:37,563 --> 00:01:39,232
I NOTICED THE OTHER PARAMEDIC,
A GUY I HAVEN'T SEEN
FOR 20 YEARS,

27
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,833
HE LOOKED AT ME,
HE SAYS,

28
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,435
YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK
PRETTY GOOD.

29
00:01:42,468 --> 00:01:44,337
SO I FEEL REAL GOOD.

30
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,873
UNCLE RED.

31
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:50,076
[cheering and applause]

32
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,978
I'M SO EXCITED.
I'M COMPLETELY READY.

33
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,113
I'VE GOT EVERYTHING READY
FOR THE FABULOUS '50s
WEEKEND FESTIVAL.

34
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,849
OH, REFRESH MY MEMORY
ON THAT ONE, HAROLD.

35
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:59,052
YOU KNOW, IT'S WHEN WE INVITE
ALL THE CITY FOLK UP TO
POSSUM LAKE,

36
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:02,188
AND THEY CAN RELIVE
THE FABULOUS '50s.

37
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:06,259
SO DOES EVERYONE FROM TOWN
HAVE TO GET CLOTHES AND
HAIRSTYLES FROM '50s?

38
00:02:06,325 --> 00:02:09,862
NO, THEY'VE PRETTY MUCH
GOT THAT COVERED ALREADY.

39
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:12,365
I'M HAVING TROUBLE
GETTING ENTERTAINERS.

40
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:15,201
EVERYONE I'M SEEING IS
REALLY BAD OR REALLY OLD.

41
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:17,203
MOST OF THEM
ARE BOTH.

42
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,038
WELL, COME ON,
HAROLD.

43
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,607
THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT
ENTERTAINERS FROM THE '50s
WHO ARE STILL PERFORMING.

44
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:24,744
YEAH, BUT THEY
WON'T BE HERE.

45
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,880
WELL, WHAT ABOUT THAT
ROMPIN' RONNIE HAWKINS?

46
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:31,951
HE PLAYED HERE.
MAYBE HE COULD TELL THE
OTHERS ABOUT POSSUM LAKE.

47
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:34,620
HE DID.
THAT'S WHY THEY
WON'T BE HERE.

48
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:38,991
DOESN'T MATTER.
INSTEAD WE'RE HAVING AN
ELVIS IMPERSONATION CONTEST!

49
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,695
OH! OH! OH!

50
00:02:42,728 --> 00:02:46,899
YEAH, YOU -- YOU -- YOU
SHOULD SIGN UP AND REPRESENT
MEMBERS OF THE LODGE.

51
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:49,802
YOU.
I'LL PUT YOU DOWN.

52
00:02:49,835 --> 00:02:51,804
I'M NOT GONNA BE
IN THAT, HAROLD.

53
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,472
WHY? WHY?
YOU'D MAKE A GREAT --

54
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:55,141
COME ON!
YOU'D MAKE A GREAT ELVIS.

55
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,609
BUST A MOVE FOR US.
COME ON.

56
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,611
BUST A MOVE.

57
00:03:03,382 --> 00:03:06,485
READ MY HIPS,HA.

58
00:03:06,552 --> 00:03:09,422
IT'S NOT GONNA
HAPPEN, OKAY?

59
00:03:09,488 --> 00:03:12,458
BUT IT IS LUNCH TIME,
SO I'M OFF TO
GREASE LAND.

60
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,664
I DUNNO.
I THINK RED GREEN
WOULD MAKE A GREAT ELVIS.

61
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,100
RED GREEN HAS LEFT
THE BUILDING.

62
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:30,843
IT'S TIME FOR THE
POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

63
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:36,015
[cheering and applause]

64
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:44,824
IF YOU LIKE SAUNAS,
YOU'RE LOVE TONIGHT'S PRIZE.

65
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:49,128
OUR WINNER WILL WALK AWAY
WITH 200 HOURS OF SAUNA FUN

66
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:52,331
FROM FAT JACK'S
HOUSE OF STEAM.

67
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,568
ALL 200 HOURS MUST
BE USED IN ONE VISIT.

68
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:57,570
OKAY, COVER
YOUR EARS, ED.

69
00:03:57,603 --> 00:04:00,539
OKAY, RED, YOU'VE GOT
30 SECONDS TO GET ANIMAL
CONTROL OFFICER ED FRITH

70
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:02,308
TO SAY THIS WORD...

71
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:06,645
YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
WINSTON.

72
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,080
AND GO!

73
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:10,116
OKAY, ED, IF YOU SEE
SOMEBODY STRUTTING AROUND

74
00:04:10,182 --> 00:04:12,451
AND BRAGGING, YOU SAY
THE PERSON IS FULL OF...

75
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,820
ALCOHOL.

76
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,323
NO, NO, NO.
OKAY, WHEN THE
COMPANY IS HIRING,

77
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:19,892
THIS IS THE MAIN THING THEY
LOOK FOR IN THEIR EMPLOYEES.

78
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,895
DESPERATION.

79
00:04:22,928 --> 00:04:24,897
NOW, YOU WORK
WITH ANIMALS, RIGHT?

80
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,366
NOW, WHAT IS IT THAT YOU HAVE
THAT ALLOWS YOU TO DO THAT?

81
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,768
MEDICAL INSURANCE.

82
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,804
NO, THIS IS LIKE A
CHARACTERISTIC,

83
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,406
LIKE A LEADERSHIP QUALITY.
THIS IS WHAT LEADERS HAVE.

84
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:37,376
OH, CONTEMPT.

85
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,445
NO, THIS IS A GOOD THING.

86
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:42,681
I MEAN, IF YOU HAD THIS,
YOU'D BE A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PERSON.

87
00:04:42,748 --> 00:04:47,119
SEX CHANGE?

88
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:50,155
UH, YOU GUYS ARE
ALMOST OUT OF TIME.

89
00:04:50,222 --> 00:04:52,458
OKAY, ED, REMEMBER WHEN
YOU HAD THAT COUGAR

90
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:55,127
CORNERED IN
FLINTY McKLINTOCK'S BARN?

91
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,864
I KNOW THERE WAS A BIG FIGHT,
BUT AT THE END YOU GOT THAT
CAT INTO THE CAGE, RIGHT?

92
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,266
THAT TOOK A LOT OF...

93
00:05:00,332 --> 00:05:02,701
BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS.

94
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,169
LET ME TELL YOU,
IF I'D KNOWN THAT
WAS IN THE BARN --

95
00:05:04,236 --> 00:05:06,438
OKAY, OKAY.
OKAY, ED.

96
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:10,175
WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOU THAT
MAKES YOU A GOOD ANIMAL
CONTROL OFFICER?

97
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:13,145
NOTHING.
I HATE THE JOB.

98
00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:15,347
SCARES ME TO DEATH.

99
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,383
BUT I DON'T HAVE THE
CONFIDENCE TO TRY
ANYTHING ELSE.

100
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:21,120
[applause]

101
00:05:27,926 --> 00:05:31,296
W.W.F. style announcer:
SUCKING SEWAGE ISN'T ALL
GLAMOUR AND GLITTER.

102
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:32,698
WINSTON HERE.

103
00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:35,267
HM-MM.
I'M ON MY WAY!

104
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,739
announcer:
AT ROTHSCHILD'S SEWAGE AND
SEPTIC SUCKING SERVICES

105
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,742
WE KNOW THAT EACH
DECISION CAN MEAN THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

106
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:46,011
LIFE AND DEATH.

107
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:51,683
[dramatic music]

108
00:05:51,717 --> 00:05:53,252
announcer:
WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT SEWAGE,

109
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:56,422
AND WE KNOW SOMETIMES
EVERY SECOND COUNTS.

110
00:05:56,455 --> 00:06:00,759
[quirky upbeat music]

111
00:06:44,636 --> 00:06:46,505
announcer:
EVEN THOUGH WE TAKE IT AWAY,

112
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,374
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,
WE LIKE TO GIVE
A LITTLE BACK.

113
00:06:53,712 --> 00:06:56,815
ROTHSCHILD'S SEWAGE AND
SEPTIC SUCKING SERVICES,

114
00:06:56,848 --> 00:06:59,718
WE DON'T JUST SUCK.

115
00:06:59,785 --> 00:07:02,754
[applause]

116
00:07:04,723 --> 00:07:06,858
NOW, I DONT REALLY
ENJOY A SALAD.

117
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:08,961
I HAVE MORE OF
A HUNTER MENTALITY.

118
00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:11,763
I ONLY LIKE TO EAT
THINGS I HAVE TO CHASE.

119
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:14,199
BUT THERE IS ONE GOOD
THING ABOUT SALADS,

120
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:16,201
THE CHEESE GRATER.

121
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:18,737
A LOT OF ENGINEERING
IN THESE BABIES, YOU KNOW.

122
00:07:18,804 --> 00:07:21,840
YOU SLIDE THE MATERIAL
AGAINST THE OUTSIDE
OF A ROTATING DRUM

123
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:23,542
THAT HAS BLADES CUT IN IT.

124
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:26,044
THEN THE SHREDDED OUTPUT
IS EXHAUSTED THROUGH
THE CENTRE CORE.

125
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,412
IT'S A GREAT DESIGN.

126
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:30,816
BUT WHAT IF IT COULD DO MORE
THAN CUT THE CHEESE?

127
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:33,685
YOU KNOW, NO MATTER HOW LONG
YOU LEAVE YOUR CHRISTMAS
TREE OUT FRONT,

128
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:36,154
THE GARBAGE MAN IS NOT
GOING TO TAKE IT AWAY.

129
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:38,924
SO I SAY, LET'S USE THE
TECHNOLOGY OF THE
CHEESE GRATER

130
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,761
TO MAKE OURSELVES A WOOD
CHIPPER OUT OF THIS
CLOTHES DRYER.

131
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:46,198
FIRST THING YOU WANNA
DO IS REMOVE THE DOOR.

132
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:51,369
OKAY, THAT'S 9 1/2.
THAT'S MY SHOE SIZE.

133
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:56,441
ALL RIGHT, NEXT YOU WANNA
CUT SOME SHARP EDGES
INTO THE DRUM

134
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:58,443
USING A POWER CHISEL.

135
00:07:58,477 --> 00:08:00,545
NOT BECAUSE IT'S THE
RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB.

136
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:02,514
I JUST ALWAYS WANTED
TO USE ONE OF THESE.

137
00:08:02,581 --> 00:08:05,317
[loud drilling sound]

138
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:09,654
shouting:
THAT WENT WELL!

139
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:12,190
normal:
THAT WENT WELL.

140
00:08:12,257 --> 00:08:17,128
OKAY, I CUT A WHOLE WHACK OF
JAGGED SLOTS IN THE DRUM.

141
00:08:17,195 --> 00:08:19,064
THAT'LL DO MY SHREDDING.

142
00:08:19,097 --> 00:08:21,433
THEN THE CHIPS WILL JUST
COME OUT THE DOOR HOLE.

143
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:23,935
I NEED THAT DOOR HOLE
TO BE POINTING DOWN.

144
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:31,776
OKAY, NOW I JUST NEED TO RAISE
THE UNIT OFF THE GROUND

145
00:08:31,843 --> 00:08:34,679
SO THERE'S ROOM FOR
THE CHIPS TO PILE UP.

146
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:36,781
OR I COULD JUST LAY IT
DOWN ON TOP OF THE WELL.

147
00:08:38,283 --> 00:08:39,784
NO, I'LL RAISE IT UP.

148
00:08:41,286 --> 00:08:42,887
AND THERE IT IS.

149
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:44,723
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

150
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:47,425
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

151
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,594
DID THAT SOUND OKAY,
OR WAS I TOO
 CHIPPER?

152
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:51,696
[chuckles]

153
00:08:51,763 --> 00:08:55,500
ALL RIGHT, NOW ALL I GOTTA
DO IS SET THE CONTROLS

154
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:58,737
HM, I'D SAY EXTRA DRY.

155
00:09:13,551 --> 00:09:15,887
[applause]

156
00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:26,531
I WANNA SPEAK TO
ALL THE WIVES OUT THERE.

157
00:09:26,564 --> 00:09:28,333
YOU KNOW, AS FAR BACK
AS I CAN REMEMBER

158
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:31,136
THERE HAVE BEEN
MEN'S MAGAZINES.

159
00:09:31,202 --> 00:09:32,670
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT,

160
00:09:32,737 --> 00:09:34,639
"PLAYBOY," "PENTHOUSE,"
THAT KIND OF THING.

161
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:37,475
NOW, I'M NOT HERE TO PASS
JUDGEMENT ONE WAY
OR THE OTHER.

162
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:40,512
BUT I BET A LOT OF WIVES DON'T
APPRECIATE THEIR HUSBANDS

163
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:43,715
LOOKING AT THOSE MAGAZINES.

164
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:47,452
COMPARISON SHOPPING DOESN'T
BELONG IN THE BEDROOM.

165
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:49,687
BUT YOU KNOW, LIKE SO MANY
THINGS IN LIFE,

166
00:09:49,754 --> 00:09:52,223
YOU GOTTA PUT IT
INTO PERSPECTIVE.

167
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:55,126
I WANT EVERY WIFE TO KNOW
THAT THERE IS SOMETHING
MUCH MORE DANGEROUS

168
00:09:55,193 --> 00:09:57,996
THAN YOUR HUSBAND LOOKING
AT MEN'S MAGAZINES.

169
00:09:58,062 --> 00:10:01,766
YOU SEE, A LOT OF GUYS MY AGE
HAVE ABANDONED THE GIRLIE
PUBLICATIONS,

170
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:04,569
AND THEY'VE REPLACED THEM
WITH THESE MONTHLY MAGAZINES

171
00:10:04,602 --> 00:10:09,240
THAT FEATURE USED
TRUCKS, BOATS, RVs.

172
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:13,378
THEY'RE ALL FOR SALE,
COMPLETE WITH PICTURES,

173
00:10:13,444 --> 00:10:16,781
AND SOME OF THEM
ARE VERY SUGGESTIVE.

174
00:10:16,848 --> 00:10:19,317
NOW, I FIGURE THAT'S
GOTTA BE A LOT SCARIER

175
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,487
THAN SEEING YOUR HUSBAND
BROWSING THROUGH "PLAYBOY,"

176
00:10:22,554 --> 00:10:24,923
BECAUSE WHEN HE SEES PICTURES
IN A MEN'S MAGAZINE,

177
00:10:24,956 --> 00:10:28,826
THERE'S NO CHANCE HE'S GOING
TO BRING ANY OF THOSE HOME.

178
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,461
REMEMBER I'M
PULLING FOR YOU.

179
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:32,297
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

180
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,766
[applause]

181
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:37,869
[loon calling]

182
00:10:37,936 --> 00:10:40,772
YOU KNOW, YOU BOYS ARE
THE LUCKIEST GUYS
IN THE WORLD.

183
00:10:40,805 --> 00:10:42,440
WHO'S HE TALKING TO?

184
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:44,676
THE BAIT.

185
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:46,177
NO,
YOU GUYS.

186
00:10:46,244 --> 00:10:48,313
YOU'RE BOTH MARRIED.
YOU HAVE WIVES.

187
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:50,415
GO ON.

188
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:52,317
NO,
THAT'S IT.

189
00:10:52,383 --> 00:10:55,453
YOU HAVE WOMEN WHO CARE
FOR YOU AND LOOK AFTER YOU.

190
00:10:55,486 --> 00:10:58,089
TAKE CARE OF
YOUR EVERY NEED.

191
00:10:58,122 --> 00:11:00,992
NO, WE DON'T.
WE'RE MARRIED.

192
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:02,927
YOU KNOW, WINSTON,
MARRIAGE DOESN'T WORK

193
00:11:02,994 --> 00:11:06,831
EXACTLY THE WAY THEY DESCRIBE
IT IN THOSE MAGAZINES YOU BUY.

194
00:11:06,864 --> 00:11:08,833
MAYBE NOT.

195
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,636
I STILL SAY
YOU'RE LUCKY.

196
00:11:11,703 --> 00:11:16,174
YOU KNOW, I'D GIVE UP
EVERYTHING TO FIND A WIFE.

197
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:18,943
[scoffs]
I DID.

198
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:22,747
WHY IS MARRIAGE SO
APPEALING FOR YOU,
WINSTON?

199
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,782
I DUNNO.
COMPANIONSHIP,

200
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:26,417
SHARING YOUR
LIFE WITH SOMEONE,

201
00:11:26,451 --> 00:11:28,419
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

202
00:11:28,486 --> 00:11:31,622
FINDING SOMEONE
WHO'LL STAY OVERNIGHT.

203
00:11:31,656 --> 00:11:34,192
YOU KNOW,
EVERY NIGHT.

204
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:36,627
NOW, DON'T GET CARRIED
AWAY HERE, WINSTON.

205
00:11:36,694 --> 00:11:39,263
YOU KNOW, WINSTON,
99% OF THE TIME

206
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,998
WHEN YOU'RE SLEEPING
WITH SOMEONE --

207
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:42,733
YEAH?

208
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,936
YOU'RE SLEEPING
WITH SOMEONE.

209
00:11:44,969 --> 00:11:47,171
THEN THERE'S THE COLD FEET
IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR BACK.

210
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:49,507
AND WORSE.

211
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,478
MUSCLE SPASMS IS THE REASON
THEY INVENTED KING SIZED BEDS.

212
00:11:53,544 --> 00:11:55,980
WELL, GUYS, I'M IN
THE SEWAGE BUSINESS.

213
00:11:56,047 --> 00:11:58,950
I'M USED TO MAKING IT
THROUGH TOUGH SITUATIONS.

214
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:01,185
YEAH, BUT MARRIAGE IS MORE
OF A GIVE AND TAKE, WINSTON.

215
00:12:01,219 --> 00:12:03,054
YOU GOTTA MEET
THE PERSON HALF WAY.

216
00:12:03,087 --> 00:12:04,956
THAT'S THE SAME AS
IN THE SEWAGE BUSINESS.

217
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:06,824
I MEAN, YOU GOTTA GET
A LITTLE GIVE IN
THE BLOCKAGE;

218
00:12:06,858 --> 00:12:08,359
OTHERWISE, YOU'RE
GONNA BE BACKED UP

219
00:12:08,426 --> 00:12:10,228
FROM HERE
TILL SUNDAY.

220
00:12:10,294 --> 00:12:12,430
YOU KNOW, WINSTON, AS LONG
AS YOU APPROACH MARRIAGE

221
00:12:12,463 --> 00:12:14,699
THE WAY YOU WOULD
A PLUGGED SEPTIC SYSTEM,

222
00:12:14,765 --> 00:12:17,068
I THINK YOU'LL
BE FINE.

223
00:12:17,101 --> 00:12:19,136
JUST DON'T
GET SUCKED IN.

224
00:12:21,372 --> 00:12:23,307
WELL, EVERYBODY'S GETTING
EXCITED ABOUT THIS

225
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:26,544
BIG '50s WEEKEND THING
THAT HAROLD'S GOT PLANNED.

226
00:12:26,577 --> 00:12:29,447
FUNNY HOW PEOPLE REMEMBER
THINGS AS BEING BETTER
THAN THEY WERE.

227
00:12:29,513 --> 00:12:32,249
SOMEBODY ASKED ME WHATEVER
HAPPENED TO URSEL HICKEY.

228
00:12:32,316 --> 00:12:34,785
AND I SAID I'M SURE
IT'S CLEARED UP BY NOW.

229
00:12:35,886 --> 00:12:37,388
UNCLE RED, PLEASE,

230
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:39,590
YOU HAVE TO JOIN
THE ELVIS CONTEST.

231
00:12:39,657 --> 00:12:40,958
HAROLD,
I'M NOT GONNA --

232
00:12:40,992 --> 00:12:42,493
BESIDES, I HEARD YOU
GOT A TON OF CONTESTANTS.

233
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,761
OH, YEAH.
YEAH, YEAH.

234
00:12:43,794 --> 00:12:44,862
QUANTITY I GOT.

235
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:46,731
QUANTITY'S NEVER
A PROBLEM UP HERE.

236
00:12:46,764 --> 00:12:49,066
NO, IT'S JUST WHEN YOU
MENTION THE WORD QUALITY

237
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,035
THE ROOM GETS AWFULLY QUIET.

238
00:12:51,068 --> 00:12:52,603
WELL, IT DOESN'T
MATTER, HAROLD.

239
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,171
AS LONG AS YOU
HAVE CONTESTANTS,

240
00:12:54,238 --> 00:12:55,606
YOU HAVE A CONTEST.

241
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:58,576
IF YOU CAN'T PICK THE BEST,
PICK THE LEAST WORST.

242
00:12:58,642 --> 00:13:02,246
NO, I WANNA TURN THIS
INTO AN ANNUAL EVENT.

243
00:13:02,313 --> 00:13:05,549
IF IT STINKS THIS YEAR,
NO ONE'LL EVER COME BACK.

244
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,651
OH, HAROLD,
IT CAN'T BE THAT BAD.

245
00:13:07,718 --> 00:13:11,856
HA! YEAH!

246
00:13:12,123 --> 00:13:14,759
WHAT?
YOU STAY --
OKAY, OKAY,

247
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:16,427
OKAY, GUYS,
COME ON IN.

248
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:18,062
WHAT'S THIS?

249
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:22,666
[laughter]

250
00:13:31,842 --> 00:13:34,678
[whistling and applause]

251
00:13:40,784 --> 00:13:42,453
ALL RIGHT, HAROLD.
I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN.

252
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,255
OH, NO!
OH, NO, YOU DON'T.

253
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:46,056
OH, NO,
NOT YET.

254
00:13:46,123 --> 00:13:47,458
WATCH THIS.

255
00:13:47,491 --> 00:13:52,163
[quirky upbeat music]

256
00:14:00,337 --> 00:14:02,106
OKAY, THANK YOU,
GENTLEMEN!

257
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:03,541
THANK YOU
VERY MUCH!

258
00:14:03,607 --> 00:14:05,609
THAT'S --
IT'S SCARY, REALLY.

259
00:14:05,676 --> 00:14:07,945
BACK TO THE BUFFET.

260
00:14:08,012 --> 00:14:12,049
[applause]

261
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:18,555
COME ON, UNCLE RED.
YOU GOTTA BE ELVIS.

262
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:20,457
OH, NO, I'M SORRY, HAROLD.
I CAN'T HELP YOU OUT THERE.

263
00:14:20,491 --> 00:14:21,859
I'D LIKE TO,
BUT I JUST CAN'T --

264
00:14:21,892 --> 00:14:24,261
WHAT?
$100!

265
00:14:24,295 --> 00:14:25,496
I DON'T CARE IF
YOU WIN OR LOSE.

266
00:14:25,562 --> 00:14:27,665
PLEASE, JUST BE
IN THE CONTEST.

267
00:14:30,234 --> 00:14:32,036
WELL, HAROLD,

268
00:14:32,102 --> 00:14:34,605
I'M A HUNK-A, HUNK-A
BURNIN' LOVE.

269
00:14:34,672 --> 00:14:38,075
[cheering and applause]

270
00:14:39,777 --> 00:14:41,645
Red: WE HAD THE
POSSUM LAKE CAR RALLY.

271
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:43,881
WE ENTERED AGAIN, AND I HAD
MY PIT CREW WAITING THERE.

272
00:14:43,914 --> 00:14:46,183
AND I HAD ONE LAST
PIT STOP BEFORE --

273
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,686
AND THEY WERE --

274
00:14:48,752 --> 00:14:53,557
NOT AS SHARP AS REALLY
YOU WANT IN A PIT CREW.

275
00:14:53,624 --> 00:14:56,493
I GUESS YOU GET
WHAT YOU PAY FOR.

276
00:14:56,527 --> 00:14:58,729
SO THEY GOTTA ROTATE
ALL FOUR WHEELS THERE.

277
00:14:58,762 --> 00:15:00,731
PUT BRAND NEW TIRES ON IT.

278
00:15:00,798 --> 00:15:03,901
AND MIKE'S JOB WAS TO
CLEAN OFF THE WINDSHIELD.

279
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:05,602
AND HE WAS ALSO GONNA GET ME
SOME KIND OF A DRINK

280
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:07,171
AND THEN FUEL HER UP.

281
00:15:07,204 --> 00:15:08,972
UNFORTUNATELY, WHILE MIKE WAS
CLEANING THE WINDSHIELD,

282
00:15:09,006 --> 00:15:11,942
HE DIDN'T NOTICE THAT DALTON
HAD JACKED UP THE WHOLE
FRONT END THERE,

283
00:15:11,975 --> 00:15:13,944
AND -- OH, BOY.

284
00:15:14,011 --> 00:15:16,613
BUT THEY GOT THE THING UP.

285
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:19,049
YOU KNOW WHEN A FLATBED GETS
AHEAD OF YOU IN A RACE,

286
00:15:19,082 --> 00:15:21,919
YOU KNOW IT'S
NOT GOING WELL.

287
00:15:21,952 --> 00:15:23,921
SO WINSTON HAS
THE POWER WRENCH THERE.

288
00:15:23,987 --> 00:15:25,522
HE JUST GOT THAT OFF
LIKE NOTHING.

289
00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:27,224
HE'S GOT THE NEW TIRE THERE.

290
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,826
HE GOT THE OLD ONE OFF
AND PUT THE NEW ONE ON.

291
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:30,194
OKAY, THAT'S ONE DONE.

292
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,962
SO WE'RE GETTING THERE.
WE'RE GETTING THERE.

293
00:15:31,995 --> 00:15:33,664
WE'RE UP TO MAYBE
EIGHT SECONDS IN.

294
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,166
AND THEN DALTON GETS THE
BAD TIRE OFF THE FRONT.

295
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:38,268
AND HE GOES TO GET
THE NEW TIRE TO PUT ON.

296
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:41,505
NO, THAT'S THE OLD ONE.
UH --

297
00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:43,974
AND THEN MIKE BRINGS ME
SOMETHING TO DRINK,

298
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,642
WHICH IS GREAT.

299
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:47,077
AND THEN HE GOES AROUND
THE BACK TO GAS HER UP

300
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,212
WITH THE OTHER BOTTLE.

301
00:15:48,245 --> 00:15:51,381
THEN HE NOTICES HE
MADE A LITTLE MISTAKE.

302
00:15:51,448 --> 00:15:54,751

00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:13,437
I'M GOING.

312
00:16:13,503 --> 00:16:16,306
IT'S NOT THAT FAR

313
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,674

NO PROBLEM.

314
00:16:17,741 --> 00:16:19,209

[applause]

317
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:37,361
IT'S TIME FOR THE EXPERTS'
PORTION OF THE SHOW,

318
00:16:37,427 --> 00:16:39,029
WHERE WE ADDRESS
THOSE THREE LITTLE WORDS

319
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:41,164
MEN FIND SO HARD TO SAY...

320
00:16:41,231 --> 00:16:43,934
audience: I DON'T KNOW!

321
00:16:43,967 --> 00:16:45,635
THOSE ARE THE
THREE WORDS.

322
00:16:45,702 --> 00:16:46,970
OKAY.

323
00:16:47,037 --> 00:16:48,372
"DEAR EXPERTS,

324
00:16:48,405 --> 00:16:49,973
"RECENTLY I READ IN
THE PAPER ABOUT SOME GUY

325
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,742
"WHO HAS 12 WIVES.

326
00:16:51,808 --> 00:16:53,276
"HOW DOES THAT WORK?

327
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,846
"SIGNED, JUST THE ONE."

328
00:16:55,912 --> 00:16:58,782
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS,
BUT I'D LIKE TO FIND OUT.

329
00:16:59,516 --> 00:17:01,218
GEEZ, 12 WIVES.

330
00:17:01,284 --> 00:17:02,986
HATE TO SEE THAT
GUY'S TO DO LIST.

331
00:17:06,523 --> 00:17:08,258
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
THIS GUY AND HIS WIVES,

332
00:17:08,325 --> 00:17:10,727
THEY PROBABLY BELONG TO ONE
OF THOSE RELIGIOUS SECTS,

333
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:12,963
YOU KNOW, WHERE THEY ALLOW
MULTIPLE MARRIAGES.

334
00:17:12,996 --> 00:17:14,831
WELL, WHICH ONE'S THAT?

335
00:17:14,898 --> 00:17:16,433
OH, GOSH, THERE'S
LOTS OF SECTS.

336
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,069
NO KIDDING!

337
00:17:19,136 --> 00:17:21,471
NO, THIS IS
S-E-C-T.

338
00:17:21,538 --> 00:17:24,241
OH, YEAH.
OH.

339
00:17:24,307 --> 00:17:26,143
SO YOU GUYS,
IF YOU HAD THE CHANCE,

340
00:17:26,176 --> 00:17:27,844
WOULD YOU HAVE
MORE THAN ONE WIFE?

341
00:17:27,911 --> 00:17:29,579
WELL, I WOULDN'T
MIND A FEW MORE.

342
00:17:29,646 --> 00:17:32,749
ANN-MARGRET,
RAQUEL WELCH FOR STARTERS.

343
00:17:32,782 --> 00:17:36,319
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'D
NEED THE STARTER, DALTON.

344
00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:38,522
AND THAT GIRL ON
THAT "FRIENDS" SHOW.

345
00:17:38,588 --> 00:17:40,123
OH, WHICH ONE?

346
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,858
IT'S THE SHOW ABOUT
THAT GROUP OF FRIENDS.

347
00:17:41,892 --> 00:17:43,426
NO, WHICH GIRL?

348
00:17:43,493 --> 00:17:46,396
ONE OF THE BLONDE ONES.
THE PRETTY ONE.

349
00:17:46,463 --> 00:17:50,133
HOW CAN YOU MARRY SOMEONE
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HER NAME?

350
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,436
I'D GO THROUGH HER AGENT.

351
00:17:53,503 --> 00:17:55,438
WHAT ABOUT
YOU, RED?

352
00:17:55,472 --> 00:17:57,641
WOULD YOU, UH, LIKE A
BUNCH OF DIFFERENT WIVES?

353
00:17:57,674 --> 00:17:59,309
AH, NO, WHEN
IT COMES TO WOMEN,

354
00:17:59,342 --> 00:18:01,945
I'M MORE QUALITY
THAN QUANTITY,

355
00:18:01,978 --> 00:18:05,248
ESPECIALLY SINCE
THE SURGERY.

356
00:18:05,282 --> 00:18:07,384
YOU KNOW,
YOU COULD BE RIGHT,

357
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:09,319
BUT I'D DIE TO HAVE A BUNCH
OF WOMEN LOOKING AFTER ME.

358
00:18:09,386 --> 00:18:12,522
FAT CHANCE, HUH?

359
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,458
AH, NO, IF ANN MARIE
IS WATCHING,

360
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:18,828

THEY UNDERESTIMATE HOW
MUCH TALENT YOU NEED

365
00:18:35,078 --> 00:18:37,447
TO BE ELVIS PRESLEY.

366
00:18:37,514 --> 00:18:39,783
YOU KNOW, BEING 100 POUNDS
OVERWEIGHT AND SHOOTING
YOUR TV SET

367
00:18:39,816 --> 00:18:42,852
IS NOT ENOUGH.

368
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:44,788
