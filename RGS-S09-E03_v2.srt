159
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:44,369
YOU GOTTA CHANGE SOME OF THE
WORDING ON THE CONTROL PANEL.

160
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:45,938
LIKE WHERE IT
SAYS HEAVY DUTY,

161
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:47,472
THAT'LL BE WHOLE WHEAT.

162
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:49,775
DELICATE, UH,
SWITCH THAT TO PASTRY.

163
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:53,011
AND REGULAR, LEAVE THAT
AS REGULAR I GUESS.

164
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:56,415
THEN OVER HERE WHERE
YOU GOT SIZE OF LOAD,

165
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:59,584
YOU WANNA CHANGE
THAT "D" TO AN "F",

166
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:02,087
AND IT'S SIZE OF LOAF.

167
00:07:02,154 --> 00:07:04,222
AND YOU CAN ADD DIFFERENT
INGREDIENTS IN HERE,

168
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:06,291
SO YOU CAN GET ALL YOUR
SPECIALTY BREADS.

169
00:07:06,358 --> 00:07:08,226
LIKE YOU COULD
PUT MALT IN THERE.

170
00:07:08,293 --> 00:07:09,561
GIVE YOU MALT BREAD.

171
00:07:09,628 --> 00:07:12,030
COUPLE OF SHOTS OF RYE,
YOU GOT RYE BREAD.

172
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,532
HEY, IT'S A WASHING MACHINE.

173
00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:15,067
THROW SOME SHORTS
IN THERE,

YOU GOT SHORTBREAD.

175
00:07:16,902 --> 00:07:20,305
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ABOUT IT,
EXCEPT FOR THE HEAT.

176
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,775
YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOME SORT OF
A SOURCE OF HEAT ON THAT.

177
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:27,412
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU TAKE
A HEATING ELEMENT OUT OF
AN EXTRA TOASTER.

178
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:30,082
IF YOU GOT NO EXTRA TOASTERS
LYIN' AROUND YOUR HOUSE,

179
00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:32,284
GET MARRIED.

180
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,919
NOW, THE ELEMENT SHOULD POP
RIGHT OUT OF THIS.

181
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:56,541
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S MAKE BREAD.

182
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:58,536
[ TIMER RINGING ]

183
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,805
OKAY, SHE'S ALL DONE.

184

MAN, SMELLS GREAT,
DOESN'T IT?

185
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:12,017
IS THAT A BEAUTIFUL
THING OR WHAT?

186
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,518
AND TO CLEAN OUT THE MACHINE,

187
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:16,121
JUST A RUN A LOAD OF
WORK SOCKS THROUGH THERE.

188
00:09:16,187 --> 00:09:18,923
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

189
00:09:18,957 --> 00:09:20,859
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

PSYCHOLOGICAL TEST?

NO, RED, THIS IS A SIGN
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON.

202

ON THE MONEY.

YOU PUTTING TRAFFIC SIGNS
IN THE WOODS, GORD?

00:10:10,008 --> 00:10:11,209
THAT'S RIGHT, RED.

209
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:12,577
I'VE BEEN WATCHING
THE ANIMALS OUT THERE,

210
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,845
AND IT'S CHAOS.

211

THEY CAN NEVER DECIDE
WHO HAS THE RIGHT OF WAY.

212
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,017
IT USUALLY GOES BY SIZE,
BUT THAT'S JUST NOT FAIR.

213
00:10:22,453 --> 00:10:24,889
I THINK MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
MOTHER NATURE INTENDED.

214
00:10:24,956 --> 00:10:27,191
SURE, THAT'S WHAT MOTHER
NATURE INTENDED, ALL RIGHT.

215
00:10:27,258 --> 00:10:30,628
BUT SHE'S OUT
OF HER MIND.

TIME FOR YOU TO BE WITH PEOPLE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE?

NO, RED, MY JOB IS
TOO IMPORTANT HERE.

TO WATCH FOR FOREST FIRES.

OH, THAT'S A NICE

00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,392

WHERE YOU STEP AT THE LODGE

322
00:14:35,272 --> 00:14:37,207
'CAUSE WE'VE BEEN

323
00:14:37,274 --> 00:14:38,909
AND, UH, WE GOT

324
00:14:38,942 --> 00:14:40,577

325
00:14:40,611 --> 00:14:42,012

UM-M-M.

329
00:14:50,554 --> 00:14:52,556
NO, I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

330
00:14:52,623 --> 00:14:54,725
YEP.

331
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:56,393
ALL RIGHT,
SO WE ALL GET BUSY.

332
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,862
AND WALTER, YOU'RE --
WALTER YOU'RE STANDIN'

333
00:14:58,896 --> 00:15:00,798
WALTER, YOU'RE STANDIN'

334
00:15:00,864 --> 00:15:02,433
WALTER!

335
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:03,934
DO YOU NOT
NOTICE THAT, WALTER?

336
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:06,003
NOW, HERE'S SOMETHIN'
FOR YOU YOUNG KIDS.

337
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,671
YOU BE CAREFUL,
YOU YOUNG KIDS.

338
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:15,112
IT CAN HAPPEN.

339
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:16,547
SO ANYWAY --

340
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,283
SO WE GOT HER ALL BUILT,
AND IT JUST DIDN'T LOOK LIKE

341
00:15:19,316 --> 00:15:21,151
ANYTHING THE KIDS WOULD
HAVE ANY KIND OF FUN ON.

342
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:22,686
I GUESS IT'S --

343
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:25,355
SORT OF RIGHT AND, UH --

344
00:15:26,824 --> 00:15:27,925
NOPE, I GOT IT.

345
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,193
THIS IS WHERE IT
DONNED ON ME.

346
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:30,527
I KNOW WHAT
WE'RE DOIN' WRONG.

347
00:15:30,594 --> 00:15:32,229
YOUNG WALTER'S STILL
MEASURIN' THAT BOARD.

348
00:15:32,296 --> 00:15:34,264
COME ON OUT.
WE'RE NOT PUTTING
IT IN THE BASEMENT.

349
00:15:34,298 --> 00:15:35,999
NOW, COME ON.

350
00:15:38,602 --> 00:15:40,504
NOW, IF WE CAN ALL
JUST PITCH IN.

351
00:15:40,537 --> 00:15:42,706
THIS IS WHERE IT'S
GOOD TO HAVE FRIENDS.

352
00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:44,241
EVERYBODY GRAB A CORNER.
PICK 'ER UP.

353
00:15:44,308 --> 00:15:46,476
PICK 'ER UP, GUYS.
WE'RE GONNA TAKE
'ER OVER THERE.

354
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,912
WE'RE GONNA --
SET 'ER DOWN.
SET 'ER DOWN.

355
00:15:48,946 --> 00:15:50,948
BIT ROUGH.
BIT ROUGH.

356
00:15:51,014 --> 00:15:52,816
OH, MAN, I GOT THE HEAVY END.

357
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:54,184
C'MON, SET 'ER DOWN.
SET 'ER DOWN.

358
00:15:54,218 --> 00:15:55,719
DROP 'ER DOWN
RIGHT OVER THERE.

359
00:15:55,786 --> 00:15:57,588
CAREFUL, DON'T STAY
IN THERE LONG, WALTER.

360
00:15:57,654 --> 00:15:59,423
YOU KNOW WHY, DON'T YOU?

361
00:15:59,489 --> 00:16:00,857
YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE
SETTIN' IT.

362
00:16:00,924 --> 00:16:02,559
YOU KNOW WHERE
WE'RE SETTIN' IT.

363
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:04,394
RIGHT ON THE OLD --
WELL, YOU KNOW.

364
00:16:04,428 --> 00:16:05,929
YOU KNOW.

365
00:16:05,996 --> 00:16:07,998
WE'RE SETING HER DOWN ON THE
OLD SINKHOLE AND LET --

366
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:09,266
YOU KNOW, THIS IS WHAT
YOU GOTTA DO.

367
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:10,968
LET THE ENVIRONMENT
WORK WITH YOU.

368
00:16:11,034 --> 00:16:12,469
DON'T FIGHT IT.
DON'T FIGHT IT.

369
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:14,605
GIVE 'ER A CLUNK AT THE BOTTOM
THERE AND WATCH WHAT HAPPENS.

370
00:16:14,671 --> 00:16:15,939
AND THERE WE GO.

371
00:16:15,973 --> 00:16:17,374
THERE'S OUR SWING SET.

372
00:16:17,441 --> 00:16:19,042
GOOD WORK.
GREAT STUFF.

373
00:16:19,076 --> 00:16:23,947
[ CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ]

374
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:28,752
WHEN HE WAS ELECTED,

375
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:32,089
HE WAS THE MOST POPULAR MAYOR
POSSUM LAKE HAD EVER HAD.

376
00:16:32,155 --> 00:16:34,191
HE PROMISED TO PUT
THE TOWN ON THE MAP

377
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:36,193
AND DECREASE
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.

378
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:38,161
INSTEAD, HE PUT THE
TOWN IN THE RED

379
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:41,198
AND INCREASED THE
ILLEGITIMACY RATE.

380
00:16:41,231 --> 00:16:44,201
HE WAS HONEST JOHN JONASSEN.

381
00:16:44,267 --> 00:16:47,904
HE WALKED INTO POSSUM LAKE ONE
DAY, LOOKIN' TO BUY A CAR.

382
00:16:47,938 --> 00:16:52,109
HE ASKED US WHERE THE LOCAL
ROLLS ROYCE DEALERSHIP WAS.

383
00:16:52,175 --> 00:16:54,177
HE JUST COULDN'T
BELIEVE THAT A TOWN

384
00:16:54,244 --> 00:16:58,315
WITH THIS KIND OF VIBRANT ENERGY
AND COSMOPOLITAN FLAIR

385
00:16:58,381 --> 00:17:01,885
WOULDN'T CATCH THE EYE
OF THE ROLLS ROYCE PEOPLE.

386
00:17:01,918 --> 00:17:05,222
IN HINDSIGHT, THAT SHOULD
HAVE BEEN A TIP-OFF.

387
00:17:05,288 --> 00:17:08,225
OH, HE WAS A CHARMER.
I'LL GRANT YOU THAT.

388
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,627
HE ASKED ME HELP HIM
WITH POSSUM LAKE'S BID

389
00:17:10,694 --> 00:17:13,330
FOR THE 1986 WINTER OLYMPICS.

390
00:17:13,363 --> 00:17:16,533
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW HOW
MUCH HELP I COULD BE.

391
00:17:16,566 --> 00:17:19,336
IT'D BEEN YEARS SINCE
MY LAST GOLD MEDAL

392
00:17:19,402 --> 00:17:21,271
IN PICKLING.

393
00:17:21,304 --> 00:17:24,074
WHEN I ASKED HOW OUR
BID COULD STAND A CHANCE,

394
00:17:24,141 --> 00:17:25,575
HE FLAT OUT TOLD ME.

395
00:17:25,642 --> 00:17:28,445
HE WAS GOING TO BRIBE
THE OLYMPIC OFFICIALS.

396
00:17:28,512 --> 00:17:32,182
HE WAS AHEAD OF
HIS TIME REALLY.

397
00:17:32,516 --> 00:17:36,720
JOHN ALSO SOLD TIMESHARING
HOLIDAY PROPERTIES DOWN SOUTH.

398
00:17:36,753 --> 00:17:41,424
HE WOULD SHOW US THESE
PICTURES OF THESE BEAUTIFUL
BEACH FRONT CONDOS,

399
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,728
AND THEN HE WOULD EXPLAIN THAT
WE COULD SWAP ONE OF OUR PLACES
HERE IN POSSUM LAKE

400
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:47,597
WITH SOMEBODY WHO LIVED
IN ONE OF THESE JOINTS.

401
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:49,599
BOY, THAT GUY
COULD SELL, YOU KNOW.

402
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,602
HE -- HE COULD HAVE
SOLD GHANDI A BIG MAC.

403
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:56,039
ANYWAY, WE BOUGHT INTO IT,
AND TWO WEEKS LATER,

404
00:17:56,106 --> 00:17:58,608
HE SHOWS UP WITH
THIS FAMILY FROM FLORIDA

405
00:17:58,642 --> 00:18:02,979
AND SAYS THAT THEY'RE HERE
TO TIMESHARE WITH US FOR
A MONTH NOW!

406
00:18:03,046 --> 00:18:05,682
SO HE GOES OUT TO HIS CAR,
OPENS THE TRUNK

407
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:07,784
AND OUT GET FIVE GUYS
WITH BED ROLLS.

408
00:18:07,851 --> 00:18:11,521
THEY WALK INTO OUR LIVING ROOM,
AND THEY CAMP OUT ON THE FLOOR.

409
00:18:11,588 --> 00:18:13,757
THESE PEOPLE WERE WEIRD,

410
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,659
EVEN FOR FLORIDA.

411
00:18:17,427 --> 00:18:18,962
I RECOGNIZED THOSE GUYS.

412
00:18:18,995 --> 00:18:20,597
I'D DONE TIME
WITH THREE OF 'EM.

413
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,299
THEY WERE JUST GUYS ON THE LAM
LOOKIN' FOR A PLACE TO HIDE OUT.

414
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:26,870
I MEAN, WOULD GUYS FROM
FLORIDA HAVE NO TAN?

415
00:18:26,936 --> 00:18:28,772
AND SCURVY?
C'MON.

416
00:18:35,145 --> 00:18:38,715
HIS BIG SCAM WAS
HONEST JOHN'S PYRAMID SCHEME,

417
00:18:38,782 --> 00:18:40,483
AND THESE WEREN'T
PYRAMID SALES.

418
00:18:40,517 --> 00:18:43,386
THESE WERE REAL PYRAMIDS.

419
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,088
JOHN WANTED TO
BUILD PYRAMIDS,

420
00:18:45,155 --> 00:18:48,558
AND FOR 500 BUCKS, YOU COULD
BE BURIED LIKE KING TUT.

421
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,160
WE THOUGHT HE WAS
ON THE UP AND UP

422
00:18:50,193 --> 00:18:52,862
BECAUSE HE HAD FUNDING FROM
THREE LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT.

423
00:18:53,897 --> 00:18:55,532
WELL, LISTEN TO ME.

424
00:18:55,598 --> 00:18:58,735
THEN HE SOLD A BUNCH OF US
THESE MUNICIPAL BONDS.

425
00:18:58,802 --> 00:19:00,537
THEY WERE MADE OF PAPER,
WHICH WAS GOOD

426
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,907
BECAUSE EVERYBODY IN POSSUM LAKE
HAS A FIREPLACE AND AN OUTHOUSE.

427
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,478
HONEST JOHN JONASSEN KNEW
HE WAS IN TROUBLE.

428
00:19:08,511 --> 00:19:12,482
NOBODY COULD IGNORE THAT
MANY EGGS SMASHIN' AGAINST
THEIR HOUSE.

429
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:14,617
THEN ONE NIGHT
HE JUST DISAPPEARED.

430
00:19:14,684 --> 00:19:16,286
NOBODY KNOWS HOW.

431
00:19:16,352 --> 00:19:18,888
SOME SAY HE DROWNED TRYING
TO SWIM ACROSS POSSUM LAKE

432
00:19:18,955 --> 00:19:22,692
WITH 700 POUNDS OF PARKING METRE
COINS IN HIS PANTS POCKETS.

433
00:19:24,093 --> 00:19:26,362
WE'D HAVE TO DREDGE
THE LAKE TO KNOW FOR SURE,

434
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:29,332
BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA GO LOOKIN'
FOR HIM UNTIL WE MISS HIM.

435
00:19:36,506 --> 00:19:38,341
OH, MAN!

436
00:19:38,374 --> 00:19:39,876
I FEEL GREAT.

437
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:41,311
I TOLD YOU.

438
00:19:41,344 --> 00:19:43,046
THAT ANGELA IS
A MIRACLE WORKER.

439
00:19:43,112 --> 00:19:44,447
I THINK I MIGHT
GO EVERY WEEK.

440
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,882
ME TOO.

441
00:19:45,915 --> 00:19:48,518
WELL, PREVENTION
IS A BIG PART OF
HEALTH CARE, DALTON.

442
00:19:48,551 --> 00:19:51,654
ABSOLUTELY.
BOY, AND SHE
IS GOOD, ISN'T SHE?

443
00:19:51,721 --> 00:19:53,256
OH, SHE IS VERY GOOD.

444
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:55,258
VERY GOOD.
VERY GOOD.

445
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:58,461
NOT OFTEN YOU SEE A PROFESSIONAL
DOCTOR WITH EYES LIKE, HUH.

446
00:19:58,528 --> 00:20:00,229
AND THAT RED HAIR.

447
00:20:00,296 --> 00:20:01,898
AND THE SKIN,

448
00:20:01,965 --> 00:20:03,433
LIKE ALABASTER.

449
00:20:03,499 --> 00:20:04,801
SHE'S GOT THE
WHOLE PACKAGE.

450
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:06,502
OH, MY.
OH, MY GOSH.

451
00:20:06,536 --> 00:20:09,005
Mr. GREEN.
OH, MIKE,
WATCH THIS.

452
00:20:09,072 --> 00:20:10,239
SHOW HIM, DALTON.

453
00:20:11,808 --> 00:20:14,143
HUH?
HUH?
HUH?

454
00:20:15,278 --> 00:20:18,214
MAN, THAT'S
HARD TO WATCH.

455
00:20:18,514 --> 00:20:21,451
LOOK, YOU GOT SO MUCH ENERGY,
YOU BETTER GET THOSE PIPES BACK
TO WHERE YOU FOUND THEM

456
00:20:21,484 --> 00:20:23,586
'CAUSE THE ARE ONTO US.

457
00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:24,654
WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?

458
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:25,788
WHO TOLD THEM?

459
00:20:25,822 --> 00:20:26,923
YOU GUYS DID.

460
00:20:26,956 --> 00:20:28,458
NO WAY I SAID ANYTHING.
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

461
00:20:28,491 --> 00:20:30,493
WELL, WHO DID YOU
TELL THEN?

462
00:20:30,526 --> 00:20:32,328
NO, I DIDN'T --
