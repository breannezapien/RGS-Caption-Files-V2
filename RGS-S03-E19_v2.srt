BILL'S BLOWS UP HIS CAMPFIRE,

00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:35,635
AND I'M GOING TO MAKE A CABIN

00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,103
CRUISER OUT OF POP BOTTLES.

SPENDS HIS WHOLE LIFE OUTSIDE,

00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:46,746
OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

17
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:48,214
OUTSIDE THE NORM

18
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,449
OUTSIDE THE ACCEPTABLE RULES

19
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:50,550
OF BEHAVIOUR THAT MUCH

20
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,751
I KNOW FOR SURE.

21
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:52,952
ANYWAY HERE HE IS,

22
00:00:52,952 --> 00:01:09,135
MR. OUTSIDE, RED GREEN!

23
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,472
>>RED: THANK YOU,

24
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:16,376
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, THANK YOU.

25
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:17,377
OF COURSE I WOULDN'T HAVE TO

26
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:19,379
BE OUTSIDE BEING MR. OUTSIDE

27
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,648
IF MR. INSIDE WASN'T HERE INSIDE

28
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:22,448
HOW ARE YOU TONIGHT

29
00:01:22,448 --> 00:01:23,383
THERE MR. INSIDE?

30
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,384
>>HAROLD: I'M JUST PEACHY,

31
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:29,722
OH SO PEACHY.

32
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:30,657
>>RED: QUITE A FEW PITS

33
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:34,127
IN THE PEACH I SEE.

34
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,194
WELL IT'S BEEN AN INTERESTING

35
00:01:35,194 --> 00:01:36,629
WEEK UP AT THE LODGE THIS WEEK,

36
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:37,897
OLD MAN SEDGEWICK GOT REALLY

37
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:39,265
TICKED OFF WITH MOOSE THOMPSON

38
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,266
BECAUSE MOOSE HAD WRECKED

39
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,234
HIS TOOL SHED.

40
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,268
BUT MOOSE SAID HEY LOOK,

41
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,302
THE ROOF MUST HAVE BEEN SAGGING

42
00:01:43,302 --> 00:01:44,303
DOWN PRETTY LOW FOR ME TO BE

43
00:01:44,303 --> 00:01:45,371
ABLE TO DRIVE MY CAR RIGHT

44
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:47,106
UP ON TOP OF IT LIKE THAT.

45
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:48,307
>>HAROLD: YEAH ACTUALLY I SAW

46
00:01:48,307 --> 00:01:49,409
MOOSE'S CAR UP THERE YOU KNOW,

47
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,843
I THOUGHT IT WAS A WEATHERVANE,

48
00:01:50,843 --> 00:01:52,412
YOU KNOW WITH THE DOORS OPEN

49
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:53,780
KIND OF SHOWING THE WIND

50
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,581
DIRECTION AND ALL THAT.

51
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:56,649
>>RED: WELL I MEAN WE HAD TO

52
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:57,683
FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET IT DOWN

53
00:01:57,683 --> 00:01:58,684
THERE BECAUSE IT'S REAL HEAVY

54
00:01:58,684 --> 00:01:59,719
YOU KNOW, SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE

55
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,720
ROLLED UP ALL THE WINDOWS AND

56
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,854
THEN SEALED THEM OFF WITH THE

57
00:02:01,854 --> 00:02:03,056
BATHTUB CAULKING AND THEN

58
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:04,457
WE FILLED HER WITH HYDROGEN

59
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,492
AND OF COURSE THIS MADE IT

60
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:07,527
LIGHT ENOUGH YOU KNOW THAT

61
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:08,961
2 GUYS COULD CARRY IT,

62
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:10,563
SO MOOSE AND BUSTER WERE

63
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:11,864
CARRYING THE CAR UP THE DRIVEWAY

64
00:02:11,864 --> 00:02:13,066
AND MOOSE WAS SO EXCITED HE

65
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,635
LIT UP A CIGAR AND BY GOLLY

66
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:19,806
HYDROGEN BURNS REAL WELL,

67
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,474
AND WHEN THE SMOKE CLEARED

68
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,976
OF COURSE THE CAR WAS GONE.

69
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:30,883
>>HAROLD: STOLEN?

70
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:33,920
>>RED: I DON'T THINK SO.

71
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,954
WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IT WAS

72
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,155
EITHER TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH

73
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:37,623
YOU KNOW UNTIL WE LOOKED UP

74
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:38,958
AND THERE IS WAS WAY UP INTO

75
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,092
THE SKY WITH MOOSE STILL HANGING

76
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:42,628
ON TO THE BACK BUMPER,

77
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:43,729
AND SHE'S DROPPING AT 32

78
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:45,164
FEET PER SECOND, PER SECOND

79
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:46,232
RIGHT DOWN INTO THE MIDDLE

80
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:47,633
OF POSSUM LAKE.

81
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:50,670
>>HAROLD: WOW! HO! HO!

82
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,804
WHOA, WAIT A SECOND,

83
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:52,905
THAT RUSTY OLD CAR IS

84
00:02:52,905 --> 00:02:54,307
GOING TO POLLUTE THE LAKE,

85
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:57,577
SO WILL MOOSE ACTUALLY.

86
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:58,644
>>RED: NO HAROLD I TOLD YOU,

87
00:02:58,644 --> 00:03:00,079
WE HAD SEALED UP ALL THE HOLES

88
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,247
IN THE CAR SO IT JUST FLOATED

89
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,615
LIKE A FISHING BOBBER

90
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:03,950
AND SO DID MOOSE.

91
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,117
OF COURSE HIS HOLES WERE

92
00:03:05,117 --> 00:03:11,757
SEALED UP FROM FEAR.

93
00:03:11,757 --> 00:03:13,159
THE CAR LOOKED REAL INTERESTING

94
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,261
BECAUSE IT WAS UPSIDE DOWN

95
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,762
YOU KNOW AND IT WAS FASCINATING

96
00:03:16,762 --> 00:03:18,130
WITH THE WHEELS STILL SPINNING

97
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,865
AND THE TIRES SMOLDERING,

98
00:03:19,865 --> 00:03:21,233
A SEAGULL WENT OVER AND DROPPED

99
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:22,668
A TREAT THROUGH THE HOLE IN

100
00:03:22,668 --> 00:03:24,136
HIS MUFFLER AND WE GOT THE

101
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:26,939
IDEA TO HAVE OUR OWN REGATTA.

102
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:28,174
>>HAROLD: A REGATTA?

103
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,075
>>RED: A REGATTA.

104
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:30,042
>>HAROLD: WELL YOU KNOW

105
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:31,010
A REGATTA THAT'S LIKE WHEN

106
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,044
ALL THE BOATS GO BY RIGHT?

107
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:32,979
AND THEN PEOPLE ALL STAND THERE

108
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:33,946
IN THEIR WHITE SUITS AND

109
00:03:33,946 --> 00:03:34,947
THEY SALUTE YOU KNOW

110
00:03:34,947 --> 00:03:37,149
FROM THE POOP DECK.

111
00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:38,184

00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,327
>>RED: THIS WEEK ON

131
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,628
'HANDYMAN CORNER' WE'RE

132
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:23,963
GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME WAYS

133
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,297
OF RECYCLING THE OLD

134
00:04:25,297 --> 00:04:26,365
PLASTIC POP BOTTLES.

135
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:27,600
NOW I KNOW THEY RECYCLE

136
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,001
THESE INTO NEW PLASTIC BOTTLES,

137
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:30,269
BUT THAT'S GOT TO BE EXPENSIVE

138
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:31,504
WHEN YOU FIGURE THEY GOT TO HAUL

139
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:32,872
THEM AWAY IN A TRUCK OF SOME

140
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,039
KIND AND THEN MELT THEM DOWN

141
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:35,307
AND RINSE ALL THE SPIT OUT

142
00:04:35,307 --> 00:04:36,575
OF THEM AND SO ON.

143
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:37,877
AND I'M THINKING TO MYSELF,

144
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,011
WHY CAN'T WE COME UP WITH

145
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:40,246
A BETTER IDEA THAT CAN

146
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:41,146
USE THE POP BOTTLES

147
00:04:41,146 --> 00:04:42,481
WHERE IS, AS IS.

148
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:43,983
FOR EXAMPLE WHY DON'T

149
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,384
YOU JUST TAKE A BUNCH OF THEM

150
00:04:45,384 --> 00:04:47,519
AND GLUE THEM ALL OVER YOUR CAR,

151
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,754
DOWN THE DOOR PANELS,

152
00:04:48,754 --> 00:04:50,155
THE FENDERS, THE BUMPERS,

153
00:04:50,155 --> 00:04:51,357
UP OVER THE ROOF BUT

154
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,524
NOT OVER THE WINDOWS

155
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:54,093
THERE'S A SAFETY TIP THERE.

156
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,327
AND THEN ONCE YOU GOT THEM

157
00:04:55,327 --> 00:04:56,695
GLUED ON, FILL THEM ALL UP

158
00:04:56,695 --> 00:04:59,932
WITH SAND AND WHAT YOU HAVE

159
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:01,467
IS YOUR VERY OWN PORTABLE

160
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:05,304
SHOCK ABSORBING CRASH BARRIER.

161
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:06,405
MIND YOU THEY'RE ABOUT

162
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:07,906
THE WEIGHT OF A REAL GOOD,

163
00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:09,174
RIPE WATERMELON SO THAT'S GOING

164
00:05:09,174 --> 00:05:11,076
TO CUT INTO YOUR GAS MILEAGE,

165
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:12,378
BUT YOU GOT TO SAY TO YOURSELF

166
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:15,247
HEY WHAT IS MY LIFE WORTH?

167
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:16,248
AND IF THE ANSWER IS MORE THAN

168
00:05:16,248 --> 00:05:19,184
$2 BUCKS A GALLON GO FOR IT.

169
00:05:19,184 --> 00:05:20,819
ANY MORE IDEAS?

170
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:23,155
WELL I WOULD THINK SO.

171
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:24,323
WHAT ABOUT JUST CUTTING THE

172
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:25,758
BOTTOM OFF ONE OF THESE BOTTLES,

173
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:26,859
THE VARIOUS THINGS YOU CAN DO

174
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,594
WITH THAT, YOU GOT A LOVELY

175
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:31,830
SOUP BOWL, OR TO MY MIND,

176
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,798
CALL ME CRAZY BUT IF THAT'S

177
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:35,067
NOT AN ATTRACTIVE PLANT HOLDER

178
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:36,068
THEN I'M MISSING THE POINT

179
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:37,169
OF LIFE.

180
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:39,138
OR YOU KNOW HALF

181
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,340
A HALTER TOP I SUPPOSE.

182
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,541
OR THIS IS I THINK, THIS IS

183
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,109
A DARN GOOD, LITTLE UNIT HERE,

184
00:05:44,109 --> 00:05:45,811
YOU GLUE A LITTLE RIM BRIM ON

185
00:05:45,811 --> 00:05:46,979
THE END THERE AND YOU GOT

186
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,347
YOURSELF A LITTLE BASEBALL CAP

187
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,648
THAT'S THE SAME COLOUR

188
00:05:49,648 --> 00:05:50,783
AS YOUR HAIR.

189
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,351
YOU'D NEED A LITTLE, WEE HEAD

190
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:53,585
FOR THAT BUT JUST LEAVE HER IN

191
00:05:53,585 --> 00:05:54,787
THE SAUNA FOR AN EXTRA HOUR

192
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,455
OR 2, ONE OF THE INTERESTING

193
00:05:56,455 --> 00:05:57,723
PROPERTIES OF THESE BOTTLES

194
00:05:57,723 --> 00:05:59,124
IS THAT THEY ARE REALLY BUILT

195
00:05:59,124 --> 00:06:00,626
TO HOLD LIQUID IN, WHICH MEANS

196
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:01,894
THAT THEY WILL ALSO WORK REAL

197
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:04,430
WELL FOR HOLDING LIQUID OUT.

198
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,331
SO TIGHTEN THE TOP UP REAL GOOD

199
00:06:06,331 --> 00:06:07,566
ON THAT AND CRAM ONE OF THESE

200
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:09,067
INTO EACH OF THE CORNERS OF ONE

201
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:11,603
OF THESE POP CASES AND THEN

202
00:06:11,603 --> 00:06:13,138
WHAT YOU DO IS YOU DRAG THAT

203
00:06:13,138 --> 00:06:14,573
UP YOUR ARM AND ADJUST THAT TO

204
00:06:14,573 --> 00:06:15,841
BE THE SIZE AND THE WEIGHT AND

205
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:17,009
FLABBINESS OF WHATEVER YOU'RE

206
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,410
TRICEPS ARE AND THEN ONCE YOU

207
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,078
GET THEM UP HERE YOU FLIP THEM

208
00:06:20,078 --> 00:06:21,380
UP ON TOP AND THEY'LL

209
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,514
JUST SIT UP HERE.

210
00:06:22,514 --> 00:06:23,682
AND WHAT YOU HAVE IS AN

211
00:06:23,682 --> 00:06:26,952
INCREDIBLE PAIR OF WATER WINGS

212
00:06:26,952 --> 00:06:28,320
AND THEY'RE EXTRA SAFE BECAUSE

213
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,788
IT'S 8 COMPLETELY SEPARATE

214
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:31,089
FLOATATION UNITS, SO EVEN WHEN

215
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:32,257
THE KIDS ARE SHOOTING BB'S

216
00:06:32,257 --> 00:06:33,625
AT YOU, YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING

217
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,261
TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT TO SHORE.

218
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:37,396
AND OF COURSE ONCE YOU'VE

219
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:38,463
LEARNED HOW TO SWIM YOU CAN

220
00:06:38,463 --> 00:06:39,631
JUST FILL THEM WITH ICE TEA

221
00:06:39,631 --> 00:06:41,900
AND CROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL.

222
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,036
OR WHAT YOU CAN DO IS JUST TAKE

223
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,871
THE ONE BIG, 2-LITRE SIZE AND

224
00:06:45,871 --> 00:06:47,105
PUT THAT INSIDE YOUR BATHING

225
00:06:47,105 --> 00:06:48,407
TRUNKS AND THAT'LL GIVE YOU AS

226
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:50,776
MUCH FLOATATION AS YOU'LL EVER

227
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:52,144
NEED AND PROBABLY MORE ATTENTION

228
00:06:52,144 --> 00:06:54,746
THAN YOU'LL EVER WANT.

229
00:06:54,746 --> 00:06:56,048
IF YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF THESE

230
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,316
CASES NOW, YOU COULD STRAP

231
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:58,684
THEM ALL TOGETHER AND MAKE

232
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,285
YOURSELF A RAFT OR A FLOATING

233
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:02,054
DOCK OR EVEN A GREAT BIG

234
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:03,622
PLASTIC ISLAND,

235
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:04,890
IT'D BE A REAL EYE CATCHER

236
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,058
FOR THE COTTAGERS

237
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,125
LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW,

238
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,327
SEE THAT FLOATING BY DURING

239
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,028
ONE OF THE HEAVIER STORMS.

240
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:12,097
BUT IF YOU'RE THE KIND OF GUY

241
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:13,699
WHO'S LIKE ME WHO HAS A WHOLE

242
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:14,966
LOT OF BOTTLES AND HAS A WHOLE

243
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:17,336
LOT OF TIME AND DOESN'T HAVE

244
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,437
THE KIND OF JOB WHERE HE

245
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:20,005
CARES WHAT PEOPLE THINK I'VE

246
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:22,808
GOT JUST THE PROJECT FOR YOU,

247
00:07:22,808 --> 00:07:28,146
A POP BOTTLE BOAT.

248
00:07:28,146 --> 00:07:31,583
YO HO AND A BOTTLE OF DIET POP!

249
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,552
WHEN YOUR FRIENDS SEE YOU IN

250
00:07:33,552 --> 00:07:34,686
A CABIN CRUISER LIKE THIS

251
00:07:34,686 --> 00:07:35,821
THEY CAN ONLY CALL YOU

252
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:38,857
ONE THING, POPEYE.

253
00:07:38,857 --> 00:07:39,958
MIND YOU THEY MAY HAVE A FEW

254
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,560
OTHER SUGGESTIONS...

255
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,627
AND THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE

256
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:43,762
IF YOU DO BUILD ONE OF THESE

257
00:07:43,762 --> 00:07:45,063
OF YOUR VERY OWN YOU GOT TO

258
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:46,198
EXPECT TO BE PULLED OVER

259
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:48,333
A FEW TIMES BY THE MARINE POLICE

260
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,534
BECAUSE THEY'LL FIGURE YOU WENT

261
00:07:49,534 --> 00:07:50,735
THROUGH A FAIR WACK OF BOOZE

262
00:07:50,735 --> 00:07:53,138
TO USE UP THIS MUCH MIX.

263
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:54,306
AND THE OTHER THING,

264
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:55,373
SOME PEOPLE JUST CAN'T HELP

265
00:07:55,373 --> 00:07:56,508
LOOKING AT A BOAT LIKE THIS

266
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:57,742
AND JUST ASSUMING THAT ALCOHOL

267
00:07:57,742 --> 00:08:01,113
WAS INVOLVED IN SOME WAY.

268
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:02,481
NOW AS A BIT OF A SAFETY

269
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:03,648
PRECAUTION, WHEN YOU GO

270
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:05,917
TO PICK YOUR ENGINE SIZE,

271
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:07,052
I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THAT YOU

272
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:08,653
PUT THE INBOARD ENGINE IN THIS,

273
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:10,322
CERTAINLY NOT A V8 OR NOT EVEN

274
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:11,690
THE BIG 6, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT

275
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,493
TO MY MIND TO SAFELY ATTACH

276
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:15,727
A 700 POUND ENGINE TO A

277
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:20,765
POLYETHYLENE POP BOTTLE.

278
00:08:20,765 --> 00:08:21,900
BUT THAT'S JUST MY OPINION,

279
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,134
YOU DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

280
00:08:23,134 --> 00:08:24,836
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU

281
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:26,738
POWER UP WITH YOUR FAVOURITE

282
00:08:26,738 --> 00:08:28,673
CARBONATED BEVERAGE,

283
00:08:28,673 --> 00:08:30,575
YOU JUST SHAKE HER UP,

284
00:08:30,575 --> 00:08:31,676
PUT YOUR THUMB OVER THE END

285
00:08:31,676 --> 00:08:32,811
AND SHOOT HER OUT THE BACK AND

286
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:34,579
YOU GOT YOURSELF A JET BOAT,

287
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:35,647
AND WHEN THE CRUISE IS ALL DONE

288
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:36,748
YOU GOT ENOUGH BOTTLES LEFT

289
00:08:36,748 --> 00:08:39,184
TO MAKE YOURSELF A FLY BRIDGE.

290
00:08:39,184 --> 00:08:40,552
NOW NEXT WEEK WE'RE GOING TO

291
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:41,920
SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE A BOAT

292
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,488
TRAILER OUT OF POP CANS.

293
00:08:43,488 --> 00:08:45,023
BUT UNTIL THEN REMEMBER,

294
00:08:45,023 --> 00:08:46,157
IF THE WOMEN DON'T FIND

295
00:08:46,157 --> 00:08:47,192
YOU HANDSOME, THEY SHOULD

296
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:49,694
AT LEAST FIND YOU HANDY,

297
00:08:49,694 --> 00:08:55,967
TIME FOR ME TO CAST OFF.

298
00:08:55,967 --> 00:09:01,906
(BOAT HORN BLOWING)

299
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:07,245
>>HAROLD: AND NOW IT'S THE PART

300
00:09:07,245 --> 00:09:08,380
OF THE SHOW WHERE WE EXPOSE

301
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,414
THE 3 WORDS MEN HAVE SUCH

302

A HARD TIME SAYING,

303
00:09:10,448 --> 00:09:13,618
'I DON'T KNOW'.

304
00:09:13,618 --> 00:09:14,786
AND HERE TO PROVE THE POINT ON

305

MR. HAP SHAUGHNESSY.

309
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:29,401
LETTER NUMBER ONE,

310
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:31,035
'DEAR EXPERTS, LAST WEEK MY

AFTER THEY TOWED OUR 64 VALIANT

317

OFF TO THE JUNKYARD I FOUND THIS

A DISTRIBUTOR CAP OBVIOUSLY.

A PROTOTYPE FOR A TOP SECRET

TO POLICEMEN, BUT I DIDN'T

648

WANT TO CALL IT THAT BECAUSE

649
00:18:49,192 --> 00:18:50,994
OBVIOUSLY VERY UNCOOL.

650
00:18:50,994 --> 00:18:52,095
