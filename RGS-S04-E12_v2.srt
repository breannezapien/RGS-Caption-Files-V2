AROUND LIKE A

WITHOUT TAKING YOUR
EYES OFF THE TV SCREEN.

IT'S FOR.

FIND OUT WHAT YOU
WANT TO WATCH,

AND ONE OF THE SHOWS WHERE
GUYS ARE SHOOTING PEOPLE.

86
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:12,952
AND YOU'RE GOING TO
WATCH ALL THREE
AT ONCE.

87
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,754
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
SOMETHING REALLY EXCITING
HAPPENS ON THE COMEDY,

WATCHING IT WITH YOU.

COME ON AND YOU START

BETTER SHOW.

LEAVES THE ROOM, FINDS

SUCCESSFUL MARRIAGE
AND A TV REMOTE,

105
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,533
BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK
ABOUT IT, WHAT IS
AN AQUARIUM?

106
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:03,602
JUST A GLASS BOX
WITH A BIG PRICE TAG.

107
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:05,671
SO ALL YOU NEED IS A
COUPLE OF WINDOWS

108
00:05:05,671 --> 00:05:07,239

THE PUTTY OFF THERE

112
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:14,113
SO YOU CAN GET
THE WINDOWS OUT.

I'M GOING TO DO,

114

TORCH OF MINE

115

AND JUST MELT THE
PUTTY OUT OF THERE.

116
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,424
WHERE'S THAT PROPANE?
OH, THERE IT IS.

117
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:29,695
ALRIGHTY.

118
00:05:29,695 --> 00:05:30,996
THIS SHOULD WORK
IN NO TIME.

119
00:05:30,996 --> 00:05:33,565
THERE SHOULDN'T
BE ANY PROBLEM.

120
00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:38,737

GET THE FIRE --

121
00:05:38,737 --> 00:05:42,841
MAYBE I WILL JUST
LET THE FLAME JUST BURN
THE PUTTY OUT OF THERE.

122
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:45,844

ALL RIGHT.

124
00:05:51,717 --> 00:05:53,118
THAT TURNED OUT
REAL GOOD THERE.

125
00:05:53,118 --> 00:05:54,686
AND NOW ALL'S
YOU GOT TO DO

126
00:05:54,686 --> 00:05:58,757
IS PICK UP THE GLASS
OUT OF THE RUBBLE.

127
00:05:58,757 --> 00:06:01,226
OH.

128
00:06:02,127 --> 00:06:03,562
ALL RIGHT.

129
00:06:03,562 --> 00:06:05,264
YOU ALWAYS WANT TO LET
THAT GLASS COOL DOWN

130
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:06,565
WHEN YOU USE
THIS TECHNIQUE.

131
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:08,500
NOW HERE'S SOMETHING THAT
MIGHT BE OF INTEREST
TO YOU,

HELPER, THIS IS CALLED
SILICONE CAULKING.

133
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,172
THIS STUFF IS A
PLIABLE GLUE

134
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:19,878
AND IT ALSO HOLDS OUT
WATER, SO IT'S PERFECT
FOR MAKING AN AQUARIUM.

135
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:21,914
ALL RIGHT.

136
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,416
NOW I'M READY TO
PUT A LITTLE BIT OF
WATER IN THAT THING.

137
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,652
YOU GOT TO LET THE
WATER GET IN THERE
AHEAD OF TIME

138
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,254
SO, YOU KNOW, IT CAN
KIND OF SIT IN THERE
AND GET ALL THE CHEMICALS

139
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:33,559
OUT OF IT BEFORE
YOU PUT THE FISH
IN THERE.

140
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,527
OH.

141
00:06:35,527 --> 00:06:38,430
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN
TO GET A LEAK OF SOME KIND,

142
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,332
DON'T FEEL BAD ABOUT IT,
NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF,

143
00:06:40,332 --> 00:06:43,101
IT'S NO ONE'S FAULT,
AND THE SOLUTION
IS VERY SIMPLE,

144
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:46,271
MORE CAULKING.

145
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:48,740
THERE THAT
SHOULD DO IT.

146
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,345
SMELLS LIKE A
PREHISTORIC ORDER
OF FISH AND CHIPS IN HERE.

147
00:06:53,345 --> 00:06:56,114
BUT I BET WE GOT
THE LEAK FIXED.

148
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:02,254
NO.
NO.
NOT QUITE.

149
00:07:02,254 --> 00:07:05,023
I THINK THIS IS GOING TO
TAKE ME A LITTLE LONGER
THAN WE HAD FIGURED ON,

150
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:10,262
SO WHY DON'T WE GET
BACK TO THE SHOW AND
I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I'M DONE.

151
00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:11,730
RED GREEN:
STAY TUNED.

152
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,198
BILL IS GOING TO SHOW
YOU WHAT HAPPENS

153
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:14,800
WHEN YOU HAVE A LEAK
IN YOUR INNER TUBE

154
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,803
AND HAROLD IS GOING
TO AUDITION FOR THE
MARINE SHOW.

155
00:07:23,141 --> 00:07:25,510
I WANT TO TALK TO ALL
YOU MIDDLE AGED
GUYS OUT THERE

156
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,647
WHO FOR WHATEVER REASON
HAVE ABANDONED YOUR DREAMS.

157
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:30,415
MAYBE YOU DREAMED OF
BEING AN ASTRONAUT

158
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:32,517
AND YOU ENDED UP
AS A SPACE CADET,

159
00:07:32,517 --> 00:07:35,754
MAYBE YOU DREAMED
OF BEING AN AWARD-
WINNING STATESMAN

160
00:07:35,754 --> 00:07:38,957
AND YOU ENDED UP
AS A WARD OF THE STATE

161
00:07:38,957 --> 00:07:42,728
OR MAYBE YOU DREAMED OF
BEING AN AMWAY SALESMAN
AND YOU ARE.

162
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:48,033
WHATEVER THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
AT THIS POINT IN OUR LIVES
WE SHOULDN'T BE BITTER.

163
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:50,302
MAYBE WE SET OUR
GOALS TOO HIGH.

164
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:54,005
MY PERSONAL GOAL WAS
TO SET THE LAND SPEED
RECORD IN A ROCKET CAR

165
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:56,741
THAT I WOULD DESIGN,
ENGINEER AND BUILD.

166
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:59,978
BUT IN RETROSPECT,
I THINK THAT WAS A
BIT OF A LONG SHOT,

167
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:02,714
ESPECIALLY AFTER I
DROPPED OUT OF
JUNIOR HIGH.

168
00:08:02,714 --> 00:08:04,950
THE LAST HALF OF
OUR LIVES,

169
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,052
WE GOT TO STAY
AMBITIOUS.

170
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:10,589
MAYBE WE SHOULD WE
MAKE OUR DREAMS JUST
A LITTLE MORE REALISTIC, EH?

171
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:12,390
WHY DON'T YOU VOW
TO GO TO YOUR GRAVE

172
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,793
WITH AT LEAST ONE
OF YOUR OWN TEETH.

173
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:18,697
[ APPLAUSE ]

174
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:23,935
OR MAYBE YOU CAN TRY
TO DO SOMETHING NICE
FOR SOMEBODY EVERY DAY,

175
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:28,340
EVEN IF IT'S NOT TELLING
THEM WHAT YOU'RE
REALLY THINKING.

176
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,675
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING,
I'M GOING TO KEEP
MY DREAM

177
00:08:30,675 --> 00:08:33,044
NO MATTER HOW OLD
AND RUN DOWN I GET.

178
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:35,313
EVEN IF I END UP IN
A WHEELCHAIR,

179
00:08:35,313 --> 00:08:38,850
I WILL TURN IT INTO
A ROCKET-POWERED
WHEELCHAIR.

180
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,919
REMEMBER, I'M
PULLING FOR YOU.

181
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,522
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

182
00:08:46,424 --> 00:08:49,761
WELL, RED'S WATER
WONDERLAND MARINE
EXTRAVAGANZA

183
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:52,564
HAS ALREADY BOOKED
IT'S FIRST MAJOR
STAR ATTRACTION.

184
00:08:52,564 --> 00:08:56,534
SOMEONE FROM THE CAST
OF BAYWATCH IN A BIKINI?

185
00:08:56,534 --> 00:08:59,938
NO, HAROLD, MOOSE
THOMPSON GOT US A
REAL LIVE SEA CREATURE,

186
00:08:59,938 --> 00:09:02,207
ONE THAT ALREADY HAD
HIS OWN TV SERIES.

187
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,675
FLIPPER?
HE GOT FLIPPER?

188
00:09:03,675 --> 00:09:05,210
OH, I LOVE FLIPPER
THE DOLPHIN.

189
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,444
OH, HE WAS SO COOL.

190
00:09:06,444 --> 00:09:08,980
HE SAVED HUNDREDS OF
LIVES IN HIS SHOW.

191
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:14,119
OH, YEAH, YEAH, I LOVE
FLIPPER THE DOLPHIN, YEAH.

192
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:17,956
NO, NO, MOOSE
GOT US FLOPPER,
THE MUSICAL MANATEE.

193
00:09:17,956 --> 00:09:20,425
FLOPPER THE MANATEE?

194
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:22,093
YEAH.
HAD HIS OWN SERIES?

195
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:23,561
HE CERTAINLY
DID, HAROLD,

196
00:09:23,561 --> 00:09:26,231
IT WAS FLOPPER'S RAGTIME
RIVERBOAT REVIEW.

197
00:09:26,231 --> 00:09:29,901
IT WAS ON COMMUNITY
ACCESS UNTIL THE
COMMUNITY SAW IT

198
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:32,871
AND FLOPPER KINDA
WENT DOWNHILL AFTER THAT.

199
00:09:32,871 --> 00:09:34,205
A BIT ASTRAY ON US.

200
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:36,141
BUT HE'S GONE TO
THE BETTY FORD AQUARIUM,

201
00:09:36,141 --> 00:09:37,876
GOT HIMSELF ALL
CLEANED UP,

202
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:39,778
LOST 900 POUNDS.

203
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:41,279
HE'S COMING BACK
IN GREAT FORM.

204
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,047
LEARN TO DO THE BACK
FLIPS AND JUMP
THROUGH HOOPS

205
00:09:43,047 --> 00:09:45,884
AND BALANCE
STUFF ON HIS NOSE.

206
00:09:45,884 --> 00:09:47,318
WHAT ABOUT ME?

207
00:09:47,318 --> 00:09:49,521
WELL, YOU'RE A LITTLE
HEAVY TO BALANCE
ON HIS NOSE.

208
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:51,589
NO, I MEANT LIKE WHAT
ABOUT ME AND THE
NEW SHOW?

209
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:53,391
IS THERE A PLACE
WHERE I FIT IN
TO THE NEW SHOW?

210
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:54,826
OH, SURE THERE
IS HAROLD.

211
00:09:54,826 --> 00:09:59,330
WE'RE GOING TO NEED
AN AUDIENCE, AREN'T WE?

212
00:10:03,334 --> 00:10:04,536
OKAY.
WE'RE BACK.

213
00:10:04,536 --> 00:10:05,970
AND TO MAKE
OUR AQUARIUM WORK,

214
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,041
I HAD TO CALL
IN THE HANDYMAN
SECRET WEAPON, DUCT TAPE.

215
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:16,247
I GUESS WE ALL
KNOW SHE'S GOING TO
BE WATER TIGHT NOW, HUH?

216
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:21,686
WELL, YOU'RE WRONG.

217
00:10:21,686 --> 00:10:24,222
ALL RIGHT.
SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO ADAPT OUR INITIAL PLAN

218
00:10:24,222 --> 00:10:26,824
AND FOR THAT YOU'RE
GOING TO NEED ANOTHER
SHEET OF GLASS

219
00:10:26,824 --> 00:10:29,527
AND A PIECE
OF TINFOIL.

220
00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:31,863
ALL RIGHT.
YOU TAPE THE FOIL
TO THE SHEET OF GLASS

221
00:10:31,863 --> 00:10:34,699
AND THEN YOU TAPE THE
GLASS ON TO THE TOP
OF THE AQUARIUM

222
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:37,302
AND THEN YOU JUST SET
THE ANGLE OF THAT
LIKE A MIRROR

223
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:39,103
SO WHEREVER YOU HAPPEN
TO BE SITTING
IN THE ROOM

224
00:10:39,103 --> 00:10:40,872
BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY
THIS IS GOING TO BE

225
00:10:40,872 --> 00:10:43,141
REALLY YOUR ONLY
VIEW OF THE FISH.

226
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:45,209
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, IT
IS SHOWING A CERTAIN
AMOUNT OF RESPECT

227
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:48,546
FOR THE PRIVACY OF THE
FISH, IS IT NOT?

228
00:10:48,546 --> 00:10:51,582
SO REMEMBER, IF THE
WOMEN DON'T FIND YOU
HANDSOME,

229
00:10:51,582 --> 00:10:55,186
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

230
00:10:55,186 --> 00:10:57,488
OH, BOY,
THE BASIN LEAKS.

231
00:10:57,488 --> 00:10:59,657
WELL, I SUPPOSE I COULD
PUT MORE CAULKING ON THAT

232
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:03,161
OR, NO, I COULD THROW
THIS WHOLE UNIT
INTO A BATHTUB

233
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:06,164
OR INTO A DUMPSTER.

234
00:11:07,131 --> 00:11:08,900
HERE WE ARE WITH
OUR RESIDENT
BUSH PILOT,

235
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,034
BUZZ SHERWOOD.

236
00:11:10,034 --> 00:11:13,037
HOW YOU DOING, BUZZ?
HEY, IT'S THE
BIG RED GUY!

237
00:11:13,037 --> 00:11:18,476
HEY, HAROLD,
HOW'S DIRECTING?

238
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:21,713
SO, BUZZ, DO YOU WANT
TO DO SOME FLYING TODAY?

239
00:11:21,713 --> 00:11:23,081
SURE.
SURE.

240
00:11:23,081 --> 00:11:26,217
AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T
BREAK ANY OF MY NEW
AIR SAFETY RULES.

241
00:11:26,217 --> 00:11:29,153
LIKE RULE NUMBER ONE,

242
00:11:29,153 --> 00:11:31,722
MAN, I'M NOT FLYING ANY
MORE LAWYERS UP HERE,
NO WAY, MAN.

243
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:33,925
ON THESE HUNTING TRIPS
ALL THE TIME WE'RE
AIRBORNE, RIGHT,

244
00:11:33,925 --> 00:11:36,060
THEY GO BUZZ MY DOOR
WON'T CLOSE PROPERLY,

245
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,529
OR BUZZ IS THE WING
SUPPOSED TO WOBBLE
LIKE THAT,

246
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:40,665
OR BUZZ WE DIDN'T
SIGN A RELEASE FORM

247
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:43,367
AND THAT MAKES
YOU CULPABLE.

248
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:46,137
I SUPPOSE IF I KNEW
WHAT THAT MEANT I'D
KNOW HOW TO REACT.

249
00:11:46,137 --> 00:11:48,339
BUZZ, HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT FLYING MANATEES?

250
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:50,942
MANATEES?
IS THAT LIKE THOSE
MASON OR SHRINER GUYS,

251
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:53,444
BECAUSE I FLEW A
FAT SHRINER --

252
00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:55,813
NO, NO, NO, THE MANATEES
THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE
A FISHY MAMMAL.

253
00:11:55,813 --> 00:11:57,515
AND THERE'S TWO OF
THEM AND THEY'RE
KIND OF BIG.

254
00:11:57,515 --> 00:11:59,584
PROBABLY LOOKING AT
TWO AND A HALF
TONS THERE.

255
00:11:59,584 --> 00:12:00,918
OH, THAT SHOULD
BE NO PROBLEM.

256
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:02,386
I'LL BRING THEM IN
BY THE NORTH END
OF THE LAKE

257
00:12:02,386 --> 00:12:04,222
AWAY FROM
THE COTTAGERS.

258
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:06,557
BUT THERE ARE A
LOT OF TALL TREES UP
THERE, AREN'T THERE?

259
00:12:06,557 --> 00:12:11,195
YEAH, BUT NOT BY
MY SECOND PASS.
HA, HA.

260
00:12:11,195 --> 00:12:13,397
ALL RIGHT THEN.
I TELL YOU WHAT,

261
00:12:13,397 --> 00:12:15,466
MOOSE THOMPSON WILL
GO ALONG WITH YOU TO
SUPERVISE, ALL RIGHT?

262
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:17,368
MOOSE THOMPSON,
NO WAY MAN.

263
00:12:17,368 --> 00:12:22,073
TOO MUCH WEIGHT.
NOW WE'RE BENDING
THE NEEDLE.

264
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:24,842
YOU KNOW WHAT WE
CAN DO, OH, OH,

265
00:12:24,842 --> 00:12:27,378
WHAT WE'LL DO IS
WE'LL GET RANGER
GORD'S FIRE BOMBER.

266
00:12:27,378 --> 00:12:29,146
THE WATER BOMBER.
IT'S A BIGGER
PLANE, RIGHT?

267
00:12:29,146 --> 00:12:30,848
WE'LL FILL THAT
SUCKER FULL OF WATER.
YEAH.

268
00:12:30,848 --> 00:12:33,884
THEN MANATEES CAN
JUST LIKE WALLOW AS
WE CRUISE THEM IN.

269
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:35,553
IT WILL BE --
IT WILL BE GREAT.

270
00:12:35,553 --> 00:12:38,756
IS THAT LEGAL?
PSSSSS.

271
00:12:38,756 --> 00:12:40,124
OH, RIGHT.

272
00:12:40,124 --> 00:12:43,327
JUST DON'T TELL ANYBODY.
I COULD LOSE MY PILOT'S
LICENSE, RIGHT?

273
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:47,298
BUZZ, YOU DON'T HAVE
A PILOT'S LICENSE.
OH RIGHT.

274
00:12:48,632 --> 00:12:54,238
IT'S MAIL CALL.
[ RINGING BELL ]

275
00:12:55,973 --> 00:12:59,910
I HAVE A LETTER
TODAY FROM DAVID
OF CALGARY, ALBERTA.

276
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,914
AND DAVID ASKS: HAVE
YOU EVER TRIED A
MEPP CYCLOPS?

277
00:13:03,914 --> 00:13:07,184
OH, YEAH, I BELIEVE
I DRANK ONE OF THOSE
WHEN I WAS IN THE MILITARY.

278
00:13:07,184 --> 00:13:08,786
FIRE DOWN ONE
OF THOSE PUPS,

279
00:13:08,786 --> 00:13:11,756
IT WILL LAST YOU A
WHOLE THREE DAY PASS.

280
00:13:11,756 --> 00:13:16,527
UNCLE RED, HE'S
TALKING ABOUT A
FISHING LURE.

281
00:13:17,294 --> 00:13:18,796
OH YES.
OH YEAH.

282
00:13:18,796 --> 00:13:20,097
THE CYCLOPS.
OH YEAH.

283
00:13:20,097 --> 00:13:21,432
I KNOW THAT VERY
WELL, VERY WELL.

284
00:13:21,432 --> 00:13:23,467
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU GET
INTO ENDORSING FISHING
LURES AND SO ON,

285
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:24,969
TOUCHY AREA
THERE, HAROLD.

286
00:13:24,969 --> 00:13:27,538
I MEAN, I'VE SEEN GUYS
CATCH FISH WITH A PAIR
OF PANTS ON A COAT HANGER.

287
00:13:27,538 --> 00:13:30,775
WOW.
HOW DO YOU CATCH FISH
WITH A PAIR OF PANTS?

288
00:13:30,775 --> 00:13:34,145
WELL, YOU GO
FLY FISHING.

289
00:13:34,145 --> 00:13:37,314
BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE
ARE SO MANY FACTORS
THERE, HAROLD.

290
00:13:37,314 --> 00:13:39,817
THERE'S THE TIME OF
DAY, THE TIME OF YEAR,

291
00:13:39,817 --> 00:13:41,652
THERE'S THE WATER
TEMPERATURE, THE WIND,

292
00:13:41,652 --> 00:13:42,987
THE AGE OF THE
FISH, YOU KNOW.

293
00:13:42,987 --> 00:13:44,822
AND THE REAL TRUE
FISHERMEN LIKE MYSELF

294
00:13:44,822 --> 00:13:46,891
TAKE ALL THESE FACTORS
INTO CONSIDERATION.

295
00:13:46,891 --> 00:13:48,692
YEAH.

296
00:13:49,894 --> 00:13:52,963
HOW MANY FISH WOULD
YOU SAY YOU CATCH
ON AVERAGE?

297
00:13:52,963 --> 00:13:55,499
OH, TOO MANY TO
COUNT, HAROLD.

298
00:13:55,499 --> 00:13:59,770
OH, I WORDED THAT WRONG.
I SAID HOW MANY WOULD
YOU SAY YOU CATCH.

299
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,873
ACTUALLY, HOW MANY WOULD
YOU REALLY CATCH,

300
00:14:02,873 --> 00:14:05,209
LIKE, YOU KNOW,
IN A YEAR?

301
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:07,778
A LOT, HAROLD.

302
00:14:07,778 --> 00:14:09,213
QUITE A FEW.

303
00:14:09,213 --> 00:14:10,981
A WHOLE MESS OF THEM.

304
00:14:10,981 --> 00:14:13,350
MORE THAN A HUNDRED?

305
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,686
WELL, YOU KNOW, I GET
PRETTY BUSY WITH THE
SHOW AND SO ON.

306
00:14:15,686 --> 00:14:19,290
YEAH.

307
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,927
SO LIKE IT'S LESS
THAN A HUNDRED, BUT
IT'S MORE THAN TEN.

308
00:14:22,927 --> 00:14:25,129
MORE THAN YOU, HAROLD.

309
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:27,331
I CAUGHT ONE LAST YEAR.

310
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:30,701
ALL RIGHT, WE TIED.

311
00:14:33,137 --> 00:14:38,776
BILL ASKED ME TO
GO FISHING AND SAID
HE'D BRING THE BOAT.

312
00:14:38,776 --> 00:14:42,713
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S
TECHNICALLY A BOAT, BILL.

313
00:14:42,713 --> 00:14:44,548
OH, OH, OH.

314
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:50,187
NOW ALL WE GOT TO
DO IS LOAD ALL THE
STUFF INTO THE BOAT.

315
00:14:50,187 --> 00:14:54,992
SO IT'S NOW
LATER THAT DAY,
WE'RE OUT FISHING.

316
00:14:54,992 --> 00:14:57,327
THE FISH ARE PROBABLY
FINISHED AND ARE AT HOME

317
00:14:57,327 --> 00:14:59,630
WATCHING ONE
OF THE SOAPS.

318
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,633
ANYWAY, FISHING YOU
GOT TO JUST KIND OF
GET INTO A MINDSET.

319
00:15:02,633 --> 00:15:06,270
YOU JUST RELAX, KIND
OF WRAP YOUR LEGS AROUND
THE COOLER AND GO FOR IT.

320
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,971
SO I'M JUST TRYING
TO ENJOY MYSELF

321
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:09,540
AND THE WAY TO DO
THAT, OF COURSE,

322
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,974
IS TO IGNORE WHAT
BILL IS DOING.

323
00:15:10,974 --> 00:15:13,277
OF COURSE IN THIS CASE
IT WAS A BIT OF
A MISTAKE.

324
00:15:13,277 --> 00:15:19,683
BILL, YOU'RE HOOKED
INTO THE RUBBER
RAFT THERE.

325
00:15:19,683 --> 00:15:23,120
LATER THAT DAY.

326
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,023
BY GOLLY THOSE THINGS WILL
GET HEAVY WHEN THEY'RE
FULL OF WATER,

327
00:15:26,023 --> 00:15:30,127
AS DOES BILL,
AS DOES MY HAT.

328
00:15:30,127 --> 00:15:31,161
WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE?

329
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:33,697
MEDICAL CUSHION.
WHAT'S THAT FOR?

330
00:15:33,697 --> 00:15:35,699
WHAT IS THAT, BILL?

331
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,501
IT'S SOME SORT OF
A DIVERSION FROM
FISHING?

332
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:39,636
WHAT'S THE IDEA?
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

333
00:15:39,636 --> 00:15:43,874
WELL, THERE'S A BIT OF AN
EXAMPLE OF OVERPACKAGING
I WOULD SAY.

334
00:15:43,874 --> 00:15:46,343
SO IS THIS SHOW.

335
00:15:46,343 --> 00:15:47,578
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING, BILL?

336
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:48,946
ARE YOU GOING
TO BLOW THAT UP?

337
00:15:48,946 --> 00:15:50,180
WE CAN'T GET IN THERE.

338
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,882
THAT'S NOT BIG
ENOUGH FOR US

339
00:15:51,882 --> 00:15:53,417
NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU --

340
00:15:53,417 --> 00:15:54,918
OKAY, BILL, OKAY,
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT STILL

341
00:15:54,918 --> 00:15:57,387
IT'S NOWHERE NEAR --
IT'S STILL.

342
00:15:57,387 --> 00:16:01,291
OH, OH, OH, OH.
OKAY.

343
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:05,662
ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

344
00:16:05,662 --> 00:16:08,165
CAPTAIN, SHE'S
GONNA BLOW.

345
00:16:08,165 --> 00:16:10,000
SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
GOING TO USE AS --

346
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,768
I DECIDE NOT TO GO.

347
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:13,971
BILL I THINK THAT'S
MORE OF A ONE MAN FISHING --

348
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:16,206
OH, A BIT OF A NAIL COMING
OUT OF THE DOCK, THERE.

349
00:16:16,206 --> 00:16:17,808
DIDN'T NOTICE THAT.

350
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:19,276
IN YOU GO.
IN YOU GO.
THERE YOU ARE.

351
00:16:19,276 --> 00:16:22,446
BILL, LET ME GET THE
EQUIPMENT FOR YOU,
ALL RIGHT?

352
00:16:22,446 --> 00:16:24,681
LET'S GET READY.
HERE SHE COMES.

353
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:26,450
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE?
THERE'S QUITE A
SELECTION HERE.

354
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,418
OH.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

355
00:16:28,418 --> 00:16:29,786
NOW WE'RE SAFE.
THERE WE GO.

356
00:16:29,786 --> 00:16:32,856
A COUPLE OF TACKLE BOXES,
A PADDLE, ANOTHER PADDLE,

357
00:16:32,856 --> 00:16:35,993
PAIL, A LITTLE BAIT
BOX, A FISHING NET,

358
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:38,061
GOT YOUR LURE IN
THERE, AND GOT
SOME SUNTAN --

359
00:16:38,061 --> 00:16:41,398
OH, OH, OH, OH.
OH BOY.

360
00:16:41,398 --> 00:16:44,234
HOLY COW.
BILL YOU CAN'T --

361
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:46,670
SLOW DOWN.
COME BACK, BILL.

362
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:51,074
OH, NO, NO, NO,
NOT THIS WAY.

363
00:16:51,074 --> 00:16:54,678
THERE WE GO.
SO WERE THEY BITING?

364
00:16:54,678 --> 00:16:56,213
DON'T YOU KNOW IT'S
BAD LUCK TO COME HOME

365
00:16:56,213 --> 00:16:58,348
WEARING YOUR BOAT
THERE, BILL?

366
00:16:58,348 --> 00:17:00,684
LET ME HELP YOU
OUT OF THAT STUFF.

367
00:17:00,684 --> 00:17:03,687
OH, IT'S LINE DANCING
AT POSSUM LODGE.

368
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:05,288
RED GREEN:
STAY TUNED.

369
00:17:05,288 --> 00:17:07,357
RANGER GORD TRIES TO
EXPLAIN ZEBRA MUSSELS

370
00:17:07,357 --> 00:17:10,927
AND THE MARINE SHOW
LOSES ONE OF ITS
HEADLINERS.

371
00:17:14,097 --> 00:17:16,766
MOOSE CAN FLY, BY ME.

372
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:19,536
LAST WINTER JUNIOR
SINGLETON DROVE
MY SNOWMOBILE

373
00:17:19,536 --> 00:17:22,305
A RECORD 49 FEET
THROUGH THE AIR,

374
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:24,407
RIGHT OVER OUR TOOL SHED.

375
00:17:24,407 --> 00:17:26,409
TODAY MOOSE THOMPSON
ANNOUNCED THAT RECORDS

376
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:27,978
ARE MADE TO BE BROKEN,

377
00:17:27,978 --> 00:17:33,717
BUT WITH MOOSE EVERYTHING
IS MADE TO BE BROKEN.

378
00:17:43,627 --> 00:17:46,463
VERY, VERY EXCITING
STUFF NOW.

379
00:17:46,463 --> 00:17:48,865
BUZZ SHERWOOD AND
MOOSE THOMPSON
HAVE FLOWN OFF

380
00:17:48,865 --> 00:17:51,601
TO BRING IN
FLOPPER.

381
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:53,436
AND EVERYTHING IS
FALLING INTO PLACE.

382
00:17:53,436 --> 00:17:55,005
IT'S PRETTY
DARN EXCITING.

383
00:17:55,005 --> 00:17:56,606
WE GOT A LOT
OF OTHER ACTS, TOO.

384
00:17:56,606 --> 00:17:58,308
WE'RE GOING TO
START OFF WITH
OLD MAN SEDGEWICK

385
00:17:58,308 --> 00:18:00,110
AND HIS DANCING BASS

386
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,513
AND WE GOT JUNIOR
SINGLETON'S MAGICAL
MINNOWS,

387
00:18:03,513 --> 00:18:05,949
THEN WE'RE HAVING
A MEDLEY OF SONGS
FROM THE LITTLE MERMAID

388
00:18:05,949 --> 00:18:09,319
SUNG BY SALLY STRUTHERS.

389
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:10,787
WOW.

390
00:18:10,787 --> 00:18:13,623
YOU REALLY GOT OLD MANY
SEDGEWICK'S DANCING BASS?

391
00:18:13,623 --> 00:18:15,392
YES, WE DID,
HAROLD.

392
00:18:15,392 --> 00:18:19,129
AND I JUST
BOOKED SMELT BOY.

393
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:21,564
THAT WOULD BE
STINKY PETERSON.

394
00:18:21,564 --> 00:18:23,633
WOW.
YOU FOUND A
SMELT COSTUME.

395
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:26,369
IT WASN'T
NECESSARY, HAROLD.

396
00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:27,937
ANYWAY, FLOPPER,
OF COURSE,

397
00:18:27,937 --> 00:18:29,205
FLOPPER THE
MUSICAL MANATEE

398
00:18:29,205 --> 00:18:30,974
IS STILL GOING TO
BE THE STAR OF
THE SHOW.

399
00:18:30,974 --> 00:18:34,077
AND THEY SAID VARIETY
TELEVISION IS DEAD.

400
00:18:34,077 --> 00:18:37,047
BUT, UNCLE RED, WHO
ARE YOU GOING TO GET
TO DIRECT FLOPPER?

401
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:38,648
WELL, FLAPPER.
THAT'S FLOPPER'S SISTER.

402
00:18:38,648 --> 00:18:41,918
SHE'S HIS MANAGER
AND SHE DIRECTS ALL
OF HIS LIVE PERFORMANCES.

403
00:18:41,918 --> 00:18:44,287
OH, OKAY.
YEAH, OKAY, LIVE, SURE.

404
00:18:44,287 --> 00:18:45,688
BUT, YOU KNOW, HAS
SHE EVER DIRECTED

405
00:18:45,688 --> 00:18:47,757
A NETWORK TELEVISION
SHOW BEFORE?

406
00:18:47,757 --> 00:18:51,828
YEAH, I BELIEVE SHE DID
THE THIRD SEASON OF
WHO'S THE BOSS.

407
00:18:51,828 --> 00:18:53,596
ANYWAY, THEY'RE ALL
ARRIVING LATER ON TODAY

408
00:18:53,596 --> 00:18:55,965
AND THEY'RE GOING TO
WARM UP AT POSSUM LAKE.

409
00:18:55,965 --> 00:18:57,967
OH, YEAH.
BUT, UNCLE RED,
POSSUM LAKE IS FRESHWATER.

410
00:18:57,967 --> 00:18:59,736
FRESHWATER, WHAT
AM I SAYING?

411
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:03,006
BUT, NO,
IT'S UNSALTED, YOU KNOW,

412
00:19:03,006 --> 00:19:05,041
AND MANATEES LIVE
IN SALT WATER SO.

413
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,477
WELL, THERE'S A JOB
FOR YOU ON THE SHOW.
REALLY?

414
00:19:07,477 --> 00:19:10,146
YEAH, GO SALT
UP POSSUM LAKE.

415
00:19:10,146 --> 00:19:12,382
OH, I LOVE
SHOW BUSINESS.

416
00:19:14,317 --> 00:19:16,152
IT'S TIME FOR THE
NATURE TALK PART
OF THE SHOW.

417
00:19:16,152 --> 00:19:18,688
WE'RE HERE WITH
OUR GOOD FRIEND
RANGER GORD.

418
00:19:18,688 --> 00:19:21,090
HELLO CIVILIZATION.

419
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,326
YEAH, ANYWAY, GORD IS
GOING TO TELL US
ABOUT SOMETHING

420
00:19:23,326 --> 00:19:25,829
THAT ACTUALLY COULD
PUT A KIBOSH ON OUR
WHOLE MARINE SHOW,

421
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:28,164
NAMELY ZEBRA
MUSSELS.

422
00:19:28,164 --> 00:19:29,966
THANK YOU VERY
MUCH, RED.

423
00:19:29,966 --> 00:19:32,235
SHOULD WE WAIT FOR
THE REST OF THE
GUYS TO SHOW UP?

424
00:19:32,235 --> 00:19:36,773
NO, I WOULDN'T.

425
00:19:36,773 --> 00:19:39,342
WELL, YOU KNOW, I
JUST THOUGHT THAT BEING
AT THIS FIRE WATCH TOWER

426
00:19:39,342 --> 00:19:41,177
FOR THE LAST 16 YEARS
WITHOUT A DAY OFF,

427
00:19:41,177 --> 00:19:43,313
THEY COULD GIVE ME
A HALF AN HOUR.

428
00:19:43,313 --> 00:19:45,548
JUST TELL US ABOUT
THE ZEBRA MUSSELS,
GORD, WOULD YOU?

429
00:19:45,548 --> 00:19:49,319
YEAH, THE ZEBRA IS A
MEMBER OF THE EQUINE
OR HORSE FAMILY,

430
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:52,689
AND SO THE ZEBRA'S
MUSCULATURE,

431
00:19:52,689 --> 00:19:55,258
IS VERY SIMILAR
TO THAT OF A HORSE.

432
00:19:55,258 --> 00:19:56,926
GORD.

433
00:19:56,926 --> 00:19:59,028
NOW, THE HIND LEGS --
JUST A MINUTE,
PLEASE, RED.

434
00:19:59,028 --> 00:20:01,030
THE HIND LEGS
ARE EXTREMELY
POWERFUL LIMBS

435
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,433
AND THEY CAN PROPEL
THE ANIMAL FOR
QUITE A DISTANCE

436
00:20:03,433 --> 00:20:04,867
AT A SINGLE BOUND.

437
00:20:04,867 --> 00:20:06,836
GORD, WE'RE NOT
TALKING ABOUT ZEBRAS.

438
00:20:06,836 --> 00:20:09,205
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
ZEBRA MUSSELS.

THEY FORM ON THE
BOTTOM OF BOATS?
WHAT?

441
00:20:14,811 --> 00:20:17,046
WHEN DID THESE THINGS
SHOW UP, JUST NOW?

EVERYBODY TO LOOK
OUT FOR THEM.

I HAVEN'T HEARD A

FROM HEAD OFFICE

WAS A PAMPHLET ABOUT
A NEW PROBLEM CALLED
ACID RAIN.

YOU MIGHT WANT TO
WATCH OUT FOR
THAT ONE.

I HAVEN'T GOT A THING
FROM THEM SINCE, RED,

NOT EVEN A

THINK ABOUT IT
THIS WAY,

PAY YOU THAT BACK
PAY THEY OWE YOU,

IS IN DEBT NOW?

GOING TO BE PART

UP POSSUM LAKE.

AREN'T EVEN COMING?

HERE, HAROLD.

THEM IN IN ONE OF

FROM A FRIEND.

ALONG FOR THE RIDE

UP THERE AND WHILE
THEY WERE CIRCLING

467
00:21:30,786 --> 00:21:33,522
HE PULLED THE WRONG LEVER,
OPENED THE BOMB BAY DOORS.

468
00:21:33,522 --> 00:21:39,629
I GOT TO TELL YOU,
MANATEES ARE NOT YOUR
NATURAL BORN HIGH DIVERS.

469
00:21:42,465 --> 00:21:46,502
FOUR TONS
OF BELLY FLOP.

OH, NO.

DOWN IN PLANE WRECKS?

THEY'RE JUST --
WELL, THEY'RE A
DIFFERENT SHAPE NOW.

WELL, I BET YOU, YOU
KNOW, HE PROBABLY CAN'T

476

BALANCE THINGS ON
