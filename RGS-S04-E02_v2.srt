00:07:04,356 --> 00:07:07,059
IS YOU HAVE TO BREAK
THE UNIT DOWN INTO
ITS COMPONENTS,

148
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,660
WHICH IS ACTUALLY NOT
THAT HARD TO DO

149
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,563
BECAUSE THESE CARS USUALLY
HAVE A SWEET SPOT.

150

ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE A DUCK BLIND

AND THEN YOU REASSEMBLE
ALL THE DUCK BLIND-LIKE
COMPONENTS

USING AN ACETYLENE TORCH
OR BOLTS OR RIVETS

WEAPON, DUCT TAPE.

157
00:07:38,356 --> 00:07:41,793

SHAPE OF IT BUT IT'S
NOT EXACTLY PORTABLE,

158
00:07:41,793 --> 00:07:45,397
SO YOU SHOULD EITHER HAVE
THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE YOU
RIPPED THE WHEELS OFF

159

THERE FOR A LITTLE EXTRA
TOUCH OF CREDIBILITY.

IF YOU DON'T
HAVE ACTUAL DECOYS,

165
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:12,257
YOU COULD TAKE SOME HOOD
ORNAMENTS AND PUT FUR
MITTS ON THEM.

166
00:08:12,257 --> 00:08:14,893
AND, YOU KNOW, IF YOU
LEAVE THE CAR BATTERY

WILL DO YOUR SHOOTING
OUT THE WINDOW

171

THE BUGS GET BAD,

172
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:30,108

00:13:49,426 --> 00:13:53,998
IT COULD BE DILL MARTIN
OF GREAT PROUD AMERICAN.

291
00:13:53,998 --> 00:13:55,533
BAD HAND WRITING HAROLD?

292
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:57,134
IT LOOKS LIKE
BARBED WIRE.

293

I DON'T KNOW.
MUST BE A DOCTOR.

THAT DEATH BED?

"DEAD BEAR" --

00:14:05,576 --> 00:14:06,977
YEAH, CALL ME DEAD BEAR.

297
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:08,379

OKAY.

RED GREEN:
THIS WEEK ADVENTURES WITH
BILL BILL GOES TO COURT

321
00:15:41,672 --> 00:15:43,507
AND WITH GOOD REASON.

322
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:45,642
YOU KNOW YOU GET THAT
ONE GUY, JUST A GOOF GUY.

323
00:15:45,642 --> 00:15:49,546
LOOK AT THIS.
LOOK AT THIS.

324
00:15:49,546 --> 00:15:52,516
OH, THANK GOODNESS.

325
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:54,051
BILL THAT'S NOT --
YOU GOT TO DRILL.

326
00:15:54,051 --> 00:15:55,118
BILL --

327
00:15:55,118 --> 00:15:59,423
OH, FOR GOSH SAKE.
OH, NICE SHOT.

328
00:15:59,423 --> 00:16:00,958
YOU'VE HEARD
OF THE NATURAL?

329
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,160
BILL IS THE
ARTIFICIAL.

330
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,828
BILL THIS IS NOT
WORKING FOR YOU.

331
00:16:04,828 --> 00:16:07,331
BILL.
BILL.

332
00:16:07,331 --> 00:16:08,865
YOU STINK, BILL.

333
00:16:08,865 --> 00:16:10,867
SO HE GETS AN IDEA.
HE FIGURES THAT THE
PROBLEM IS THAT

334
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:14,871
THE NET'S TOO HIGH,
IT'S NOT THAT THE
BALL IS TOO LOW.

335
00:16:14,871 --> 00:16:16,273
SO HE'LL LOWER
THAT NET.

336
00:16:16,273 --> 00:16:18,008
THAT'S KIND OF
A PERMANENT SOLUTION.

337
00:16:18,008 --> 00:16:20,944
LOOK OUT THERE, HAROLD.
HAROLD, THE NET!

338
00:16:20,944 --> 00:16:22,980
OH, I'M SURROUNDED HERE.

339
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,283
ALL RIGHT SO BILL UNDOES
ONE OF HIS MANY TENSOR
BANDAGES

340
00:16:26,283 --> 00:16:28,251
AND HE USES THAT TO
ATTACH THE CUT POLE

341
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:30,387
SO NOW LOOK AT THE
HEIGHT OF THAT.

342
00:16:30,387 --> 00:16:32,389
THERE'S A CHANCE HE MIGHT
BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY
DUNK THIS ONE

343
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:35,826
ISN'T THERE, BILL?
MAYBE NOT.

344
00:16:35,826 --> 00:16:38,428
SHOOT WITH THE LEGS.
SHOOT WITH THE LEGS.

345
00:16:38,428 --> 00:16:41,465
GO HOME BILL.
GO HOME.

346
00:16:41,465 --> 00:16:42,866
HE'S GETTING PRETTY
FRUSTRATED NOW.

347
00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:46,136
OH -- OH, YOU BETTER WATCH
THE BALL THERE HAROLD.

348
00:16:46,136 --> 00:16:47,504
ALL RIGHT.

349
00:16:47,504 --> 00:16:51,742
OH, I FORGOT, HIS THEORY NOW
IS THAT IT'S THE SHOES.

350
00:16:51,742 --> 00:16:55,445
IT'S THE SHOES AND THEY
ARE NOT TOTALLY BLAMELESS.

351
00:16:55,445 --> 00:17:00,050
SO OUT HE GOES TO GET
HIMSELF SOME OF THE FANCY
WHAT ARE THEY $12,000.

352
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,752
SO HAROLD AND
I KIND OF --

353
00:17:01,752 --> 00:17:03,720
HAROLD IS GOOD WITH
A HAMMER, ISN'T HE?

354
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,057
I HOPE HE GETS
AN EDUCATION.

355
00:17:07,057 --> 00:17:08,658
AND HERE HE COMES.

356
00:17:08,658 --> 00:17:11,862
HE'S LOOKING A LITTLE THINNER
BECAUSE HIS WALLET'S GONE.

357
00:17:11,862 --> 00:17:13,463
HE GOT HIMSELF SOME
OF THOSE FANCY

358
00:17:13,463 --> 00:17:16,233
SIGNATURE SHOES THEY
USE ON THE BIG BASKETBALL.

359
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:17,801
LET'S HAVE A LOOK.
LET'S HAVE A LOOK.

360
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:19,369
WHAT DO THEY LOOK LIKE?
WHAT ARE THEY LIKE?

361
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:21,705
OH MY GOSH,
LOOK AT THAT.

362
00:17:21,705 --> 00:17:24,808
WOW.

363
00:17:24,808 --> 00:17:28,078
YOU PUMP THOSE BABIES
UP, DO YOU BILL?

364
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:30,881
WHAT'S THIS, 10-W-30?

365
00:17:30,881 --> 00:17:32,549
YOU CAN PLAY IN THE
WINTER AND EVERYTHING.

366
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:35,452
OH MY GOSH, DON'T HURT
YOURSELF THERE, BILL.

367
00:17:35,452 --> 00:17:39,389
OH MY GOSH LOOK AT
THE DIFFERENCE.
IT IS THE SHOES.

368
00:17:39,389 --> 00:17:41,725
OH BOY, OH BOY, OH BOY.

369
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:43,159
THAT'S GOOD SHOOTING.

370
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:44,895
BILL DON'T GET OVER CON ---

371
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:47,664
I'LL GET HIM DOWN.

372
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:50,100
OH, SORRY BILL, I
DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

373
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,403
OH, A BUTT DUNK.

374
00:17:53,403 --> 00:17:55,572
COMING UP WE GOT A FASHION
STATEMENT FROM ME

375
00:17:55,572 --> 00:17:57,374
AND BUZZ SHERWOOD
ACTING LIKE A TAILOR

376
00:17:57,374 --> 00:18:00,176
AND TAKES HAROLD
INSEAM MEASUREMENT.

377
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:12,522
WELL THE ANNUAL POSSUM
LAKE TAXIDERMY SHOOTOUT
IS REALLY PICKING UP SPEED.

378
00:18:12,522 --> 00:18:14,024
THE GUYS ARE REALLY
GETTING INTO IT.

379
00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:15,859
JUNIOR TOOK THE FUN FUR
SEAT COVERS OUT OF
HIS PLYMOUTH

380
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:18,461
SO WE CAN
PRACTICE ON THOSE.

381
00:18:18,461 --> 00:18:20,230
WE JUST GOT TO GET GET THE
UNICORN OWL OUT OF HERE

382
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,132
BEFORE THE
CONSERVATIONISTS SPOT IT.

383
00:18:22,132 --> 00:18:23,600
THAT'S RIGHT, BECAUSE ONCE
THEY SEE IT,

384
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,402
THERE WON'T BE ANYMORE
HUNTING OR FISHING
OR CHOPPING

385
00:18:25,402 --> 00:18:27,570
OR DIGGING OR BURNING
OR TRAMPLING.

386
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,774
I KNOW, HOW ARE WE GOING
TO COMMUNE WITH NATURE?

387
00:18:30,774 --> 00:18:36,346
UNCLE RED, ARE YOU
AWARE THAT YOU'RE
STANDING UNDER A BEAR?

388
00:18:36,346 --> 00:18:40,016
A LOT OF US ARE DRESSING
UP LIKE ANIMALS TO
CHASE THE OWL AWAY.

389
00:18:40,016 --> 00:18:45,488
CAN OWLS FLY WHEN
THEY'RE LAUGHING?

390
00:18:48,024 --> 00:18:49,492
IT'S NOT FAIR, HAROLD.

391
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:51,461
WE FINALLY FIND SOMETHING
TO DO THAT DOESN'T
HURT ANYBODY

392
00:18:51,461 --> 00:18:52,896
AND THEY'RE GOING
TO MAKE US STOP.

393
00:18:52,896 --> 00:18:55,465
HOW COME WHEN YOU GET
OLDER THEY TAKE AWAY
EVERYTHING THAT'S FUN?

394
00:18:55,465 --> 00:18:56,866
HOW COME FUN ALWAYS
HAS TO MEAN SOMETHING

395
00:18:56,866 --> 00:18:59,202
THAT'S USELESS,
DANGEROUS AND DESTRUCTIVE?

396
00:18:59,202 --> 00:19:01,471
IT JUST DOES,
THAT'S ALL.

397
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:02,906
COME ON, UNCLE RED,
THINK ABOUT IT.

398
00:19:02,906 --> 00:19:06,709
WOULDN'T IT BE EXCITING
TO HAVE LIKE A UNICORN
OWL AROUND POSSUM LODGE?

399
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:10,213
WE'VE ALREADY GOT ONE
GUY WHO'S BIG BEAKED,
BIRD BRAINED

400
00:19:10,213 --> 00:19:12,348
AND BEADY EYED AND
SOUNDS JUST LIKE AN OWL.

401
00:19:12,348 --> 00:19:16,820
WHO?
WHO?

402
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:22,325
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY
ENDANGERED SPECIES ONE
LODGE CAN STAND?

403
00:19:23,793 --> 00:19:31,401
FOR SALE: 78 AMC PACER,
ENGINE SEIZED UP, MAKES
A PERFECT GREENHOUSE.

404
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:35,572
WE'RE UP HERE WITH OUR
RESIDENT BUSH PILOT,
BUZZ SHERWOOD

405
00:19:35,572 --> 00:19:38,107
TO GET AN UPDATE ON
THE UNICORN OWL SITUATION.

406
00:19:38,107 --> 00:19:40,777
YO, THE BIG RED GUY!
HOW'S IT GOING?

407
00:19:40,777 --> 00:19:43,980
AND HAROLD, WOAH.

408
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,884
COME ON, HAROLD, STAND
UP STRAIGHT OR START
WEARING A SUPPORTER.

409
00:19:47,884 --> 00:19:49,852
BUZZ WHAT THE HECK
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

410
00:19:49,852 --> 00:19:51,955
RED, I'M DISGUISING
MY PLANE TO LOOK LIKE

411
00:19:51,955 --> 00:19:53,756
A GIANT UNICORN
OWL, RIGHT?

412
00:19:53,756 --> 00:19:55,992
THEN I'M GOING TO GO
FLYING AROUND LOOKING
FOR THE LITTLE GUY.

413
00:19:55,992 --> 00:19:57,393
OH, YOU'RE GOING TO
SCARE HIM AWAY, RIGHT?

414
00:19:57,393 --> 00:19:59,529
NO, I'M NOT GOING TO
GO SCARING HIM AWAY,

415
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:01,864
NOT WITH THE
CONSERVATIONISTS
TRACKING HIM DOWN.

416
00:20:01,864 --> 00:20:04,000
YOU KNOW THEY GOT A
TRANSMITTER ON HIM
TRYING TO STEER HIM

417
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,970
TOWARDS A FEMALE
FOR A BIG LOVE-IN.

418
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,304
WELL, I STILL DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHY

419
00:20:08,304 --> 00:20:10,340
YOU'RE TURNING YOUR PLANE
INTO THE UGLY DUCKLING.

420
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,575
WELL, YOU SEE, I FIGURE
I'M GOING TO FLY AROUND

421
00:20:12,575 --> 00:20:15,878
AND THEN I'M GOING TO
SHOW HIM SOME MAJOR
UNICORN OWL MOVES

422
00:20:15,878 --> 00:20:18,281
SO THAT HE CAN REALLY
IMPRESS THE BABES, RIGHT,

423
00:20:18,281 --> 00:20:21,617
CAUSE HE'S BEEN ALONE A
LONG TIME, GONE WITHOUT

424
00:20:21,617 --> 00:20:25,021
AND I REALLY KNOW
HOW THAT FEELS.
YEAH, YEAH.

425
00:20:25,021 --> 00:20:27,590
BUT BUZZ WHAT KIND OF
BIRD MOVES CAN YOU
SHOW AN OWL?

426
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,425
OH, WELL, I WAS READING
UP ON THAT RED, RIGHT,

427
00:20:29,425 --> 00:20:31,160
AND THERE'S LIKE TWO HE'S
GOT TO REMEMBER, OKAY?

428
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,695
SO LIKE HE FLIES IN
BESIDE HER, RIGHT

429
00:20:32,695 --> 00:20:35,565
AND HE GOES HI, HOW ARE
YOU, COME TO THIS
SWAMP OFTEN

430
00:20:35,565 --> 00:20:37,233
AND LIKE CAN
I GET YOU A MOUSE?

431
00:20:37,233 --> 00:20:39,202
AND THEN SHE GOES,
BACK OFF CREEP, I'M
HERE WITH MY SISTER,

432
00:20:39,202 --> 00:20:41,170
AND THEN SHE TRIES TO
SCRATCH HIS EYES OUT.

433
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:43,573
THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS.
COULD BE.
COULD BE.

434
00:20:43,573 --> 00:20:47,076
BUT I FIGURE WE'LL BE
OKAY AS LONG AS I DON'T
TRY TO FLAP MY WINGS AND,

435
00:20:47,076 --> 00:20:49,112
YOU KNOW, WHEN
IT COMES TO THE
INTIMATE MATING STUFF,

436
00:20:49,112 --> 00:20:51,047
YOU KNOW, WE'LL TRY TO
KEEP HIM AWAY FROM
THE PROPELLER.

437
00:20:51,047 --> 00:20:53,649
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
THEY'LL BE EVISCERATED.

438
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:55,151
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M THINKING?

439
00:20:55,151 --> 00:20:58,554
WHY DON'T YOU GET HIM A
LONG WAYS AWAY FROM HERE
TO TEACH HIM THIS STUFF?

440
00:20:58,554 --> 00:21:00,456
GOOD IDEA.
YEAH.

441
00:21:00,456 --> 00:21:02,525
YEAH, BECAUSE,
YOU KNOW, HE'LL BE
A LITTLE EMBARRASSED,

442
00:21:02,525 --> 00:21:04,026
RIGHT, HITTING ON
THE BABES FOR THE
FIRST TIME.

443
00:21:04,026 --> 00:21:05,461
HE COULD BE A
LITTLE RUSTY.

444
00:21:05,461 --> 00:21:08,564
HE COULD STRIKE OUT A
COUPLE OF TIMES, RIGHT?
OH, FOR SURE.

445
00:21:10,266 --> 00:21:12,902
FIGURE SKATING BY ME.

446
00:21:12,902 --> 00:21:14,737
WE'RE SKATING
ON THE POND

447
00:21:14,737 --> 00:21:16,772
AND MOOSE THOMPSON
DOES A TRIPLE AXLE

448
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:19,976
FOLLOWED BY A QUADRUPLE LUTZ
AND A TRIPLE-TOE LOOP.

449
00:21:19,976 --> 00:21:22,078
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
YOU'RE ON A BREAKAWAY

450
00:21:22,078 --> 00:21:24,714
AND YOU CATCH YOUR TOE
ON A FROZEN WEASEL.

451
00:21:24,714 --> 00:21:27,917
[ APPLAUSE ]

452
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:31,654
WELL, THE POSSUM LAKE
TAXIDERMY SHOOTOUT
WAS A HUGE SUCCESS.

453
00:21:31,654 --> 00:21:34,056
WE ENDED UP WITH THE SAME
NUMBER OF DEAD THINGS
WE STARTED WITH,

454
00:21:34,056 --> 00:21:36,158
SO THAT'S ALWAYS GOOD.

455
00:21:36,158 --> 00:21:38,895
THE ONLY DRAWBACK WAS
NOBODY WANTED TO GIVE
ANYTHING BACK TO ARTIE.

456
00:21:38,895 --> 00:21:41,197
THEY SAID I SHOT
IT, I KEEP IT.

457
00:21:41,197 --> 00:21:44,767
I GUESS NEXT YEAR WE'LL
BE SHOOTING PICTURES
OF ANIMALS.

458
00:21:44,767 --> 00:21:46,969
THE CONSERVATIONIST CAME
AND THEY TOOK, YOU KNOW,

459
00:21:46,969 --> 00:21:51,274
THE UNICORN OWL BACK TO
HIS MATE SO THEY COULD MATE.

460
00:21:51,274 --> 00:21:53,209
SO THAT WAY,
THEY'LL BE MATING

461
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:56,812
IF ANYONE WENT LOOKING FOR
THEM, THEY'LL BE BUSY
BECAUSE THEY'RE MATING.

462
00:21:56,812 --> 00:21:59,815
THE KNOW THE WAY A BIRD
HAS A BIRD, YOU KNOW.

463
00:21:59,815 --> 00:22:03,319
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
HAVING ONE YOURSELF
THERE, HAROLD.

464
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:06,022
AND OF COURSE
THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T
STICK ITS NOSE IN

465
00:22:06,022 --> 00:22:07,657
WITHOUT COMING UP
WITH SOME CASH,

466
00:22:07,657 --> 00:22:11,327
SO THEY GAVE
ME THIS INFRACTION.
WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE?

467
00:22:11,327 --> 00:22:14,130
WELL, I SHOT
THEIR TRUCK.

468
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:17,566
AMAZING HOW MUCH
A LANDROVER LOOKS
LIKE A BLUE RHINO.

469
00:22:17,566 --> 00:22:20,202
ESPECIALLY WITH
YOUR EYESIGHT.

470
00:22:20,202 --> 00:22:21,804
WELL, THAT'S WHY I HAD
THE SEMI-AUTOMATIC.

471
00:22:21,804 --> 00:22:24,306
THE AIM IS NOT
SO CRUCIAL ON IT.

472
00:22:24,306 --> 00:22:25,941
SO THEN, I GUESS THE
BIGGEST PRIZE OF THE DAY

473
00:22:25,941 --> 00:22:27,676
IS THIS HUNDRED DOLLAR
TICKET OF YOURS.

474
00:22:27,676 --> 00:22:29,945
ARE YOU GOING TO
HAVE IT MOUNTED?

475
00:22:29,945 --> 00:22:32,915
NO, BUT I MAY
HAVE YOU STUFF IT.

476
00:22:32,915 --> 00:22:34,917
[ POSSUM SQUEALING ]

477
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:37,286
WELL, THERE'S THE
CRY OF THE POSSUM.
MEETING TIME.

478
00:22:37,286 --> 00:22:38,387
YEAH, YOU GO
AHEAD HAROLD.

479
00:22:38,387 --> 00:22:41,056
I WILL BE DOWN
IN A LITTLE WHILE.
ALL RIGHT.

480
00:22:41,056 --> 00:22:42,625
YOU KNOW, AS YOU GET
OLDER YOU REALIZE

481
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,427
YOU CAN'T ALWAYS
GET WHAT YOU WANT

482
00:22:44,427 --> 00:22:48,697
BUT IF YOU TRY SOMETIMES
YOU CAN GET YET ANOTHER
FINANCIAL SETBACK.

483
00:22:48,697 --> 00:22:51,100
SO IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,
THE GREAT WHITE HUNTER

484
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,202
WILL BE COMING STRAIGHT
HOME AFTER THE MEETING

485
00:22:53,202 --> 00:22:56,305
AND I'LL BE BRINGING
A SECOND TIME AROUND
WILD TURKEY,

486
00:22:56,305 --> 00:22:59,341
KIND OF LIGHT
ON THE MEAT

487
00:22:59,341 --> 00:23:02,077
AND HEAVY ON THE STUFFING
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

488
00:23:02,077 --> 00:23:04,046
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS SO MUCH
FOR WATCHING.

BEHALF OF MYSELF

UP HERE AT POSSUM LODGE,
