1
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:08,608
(Gavel pounding)

2
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,510
IT'S
"THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW".

3
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,912
HERE'S THE MAN
YOU'VE WAITED TO WATCH,

4
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:15,148
THE MAN WHO SHOULD
WATCH HIS WEIGHT,

5
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:17,350
WHICH IS EASY
'CAUSE IT STICKS OUT.

6
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:18,852
HERE HE IS,

7
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:22,188
MY UNCLE, MR. RED GREEN!

8
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:24,491
(Applause)

9
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:34,534
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

10
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,369
GOT AN EXCITING SHOW.

11
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:38,171
A BUNCH OF US ARE BUILDING

12
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:40,573
A CABLE CAR RIDE
AT ROCK REEF POINT

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,210
BY DUCT TAPING GROCERY CARTS
TO A GARAGE DOOR OPENER.

14
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:45,912
ONLY NEED ONE MORE PART.

15
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,615
DID YOU GET
THAT NINE-VOLT BATTERY?

16
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,116
NO, NOT EXACTLY.

17
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:51,851
OLD MAN SEDGWICK
WAS GOING INTO TOWN.

18
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:54,153
I ASKED HIM TO PICK UP
THE BATTERY

19
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,688
AND GET SOME LICORICE.

20
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:58,491
HAROLD, OLD MAN SEDGWICK
IS NOT RELIABLE.

21
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,395
HIS BRAIN ONLY LASTED THIS LONG
'CAUSE HE NEVER USES IT.

22
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:05,698
WHENEVER HE GOES TO TOWN
HE JUST STEALS SOMETHING,

23
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,600
COMES HOME IN A POLICE CAR.

24
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:11,037
WELL THEN, I GUESS HE DIDN'T DO
AS I ASKED.

25
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:14,641
HE DIDN'T BRING BACK
A NINE-VOLT BATTERY, HUH?

26
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:18,077
OK, WELL THEN, MAYBE YOU
CAN EXPLAIN THIS.

27
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:19,746
WAIT A SEC, THAT'S NOT IT.

28
00:01:19,812 --> 00:01:21,247
THAT'S NOT A BATTERY.

29
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:22,649
I GOT ONE -- JUST A SEC.

30
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:24,150
HOLD IT.

31
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:27,453
OHH-OO.

32
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,656
WHAT DO YOU SAY NOW?

33
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:31,157
(Sirens)

34
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:34,093
OFFICER, THE GUY YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR IS RIGHT HERE.

35
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:42,869
(Horns honking)

36
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:46,105
(Geese honking)

37
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,209
(Quacking)

38
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:56,249
(Red): TODAY GARTH SHOWS YOU
HOW TO GET RID OF PIGEONS.

39
00:01:56,315 --> 00:02:00,253
I'LL MAKE A CABLE CAR
TO GET YOU UP THE MOUNTAIN,

40
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,257
BUZZ SHERWOOD HAS MADE
A TRAILER FOR HIS AIRPLANE.

41
00:02:04,323 --> 00:02:07,560
HERE'S THE BAD NEWS:
HAROLD IS HAROLD.

42
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:14,367
OLD MAN SEDGWICK'S
IN THE SLAMMER.

43
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:17,937
IT'S OK, HAROLD,
YOU CAN COME OUT NOW.

44
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,506
(Audience laughing)

45
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:24,343
HE ONLY
STOLE

46
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,580
A BATTERY -- SURELY
THEY WON'T INCARCERATE HIM.

47
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,382
OR IS THERE AN ELECTION

48
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,883
COMING UP?

49
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,819
IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE THEFT.

50
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:36,122
IT WAS RESISTING ARREST,
THROWING THE MEAT PIES

51
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:39,959
AND MAKING THE BODY NOISES
IN THE BACK OF THE CRUISER.

52
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,328
YOU KNOW WHAT?! --
THIS IS GREAT.

53
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:43,896
I COULD BE HIS LAWYER.

54
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,431
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

55
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,766
I KNOW ABOUT LAW.

56
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,303
I'VE GOT EVERY EPISODE
OF "LAW AND ORDER" ON TAPE.

57
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:53,406
I KNOW ALL ABOUT TENETS
AND PRECEDENTS.

58
00:02:53,472 --> 00:02:56,042
YOU DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT BRIEFS.

59
00:02:56,108 --> 00:02:57,610
(Laughing)

60
00:02:58,477 --> 00:02:59,912
AHA!

61
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:03,583
(Red): KEEPING WITH THE THEME
OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY,

62
00:03:03,649 --> 00:03:05,418
BILL'S GOING TO TEACH YOU

63
00:03:05,484 --> 00:03:07,720
HOW TO WATCH OUT
FOR PICKPOCKETS.

64
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:09,989
THE MAIN THING IS
PAY ATTENTION.

65
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:12,725
GARTH HARBLE HERE,
ANIMAL CONTROL,

66
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:17,163
WITH ANOTHER IMPORTANT TIP
ON HOW YOU CONTROL ANIMALS.

67
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:18,931
COME ON IN HERE, RED.

68
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,633
A BIT OF A HEAD INJURY.

69
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,435
CHASING BEARS IN A CAVE?

70
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:24,303
NO -- EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE.

71
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,805
BOY, DID I NAIL MYSELF.

72
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:27,974
SMACKED RIGHT INTO
A STALACTITE.

73
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,842
BEARS DIDN'T EAT ME THOUGH.

74
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,478
WHEN I WENT DOWN
THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT

75
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,447
SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH ME.

76
00:03:34,513 --> 00:03:37,216
BEARS ARE SMART THAT WAY.

77
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:40,920
I LAY IN THAT CAVE
FOR HALF A DAY, UNCONSCIOUS.

78
00:03:40,986 --> 00:03:45,458
WHEN MY BOSS, LEO, FOUND OUT,
HE DOCKED ME FOUR HOURS PAY.

79
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:47,693
I HOPE LEO DIES BEFORE I DO.

80
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,830
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
THE LOOK ON HIS FACE

81
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:53,666
WHEN I DON'T SHOW UP
AT HIS FUNERAL.

82
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,403
GARTH, DO YOU HAVE A TIP
OF ANY KIND FOR US HERE?

83
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,904
HUH?

84
00:03:58,971 --> 00:04:01,373
AN ANIMAL TIP OF ANY KIND?

85
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,743
OH, OH, OH -- PIGEONS.

86
00:04:03,809 --> 00:04:07,546
PIGEONS ARE AN IMPORTANT LINK
IN THE ECOLOGICAL CHAIN

87
00:04:07,613 --> 00:04:11,450
BECAUSE THEY TAKE THINGS LIKE
GRUBS AND FOODSTUFFS

88
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:14,320
AND THEY REDISTRIBUTE THEM
FROM THE SKY,

89
00:04:14,386 --> 00:04:17,423
USUALLY ON YOUR FRONT WALK
OR YOUR WINDSHIELD.

90
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,725
RED, ONE WAY
TO GET RID OF PIGEONS

91
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,294
IS WITH A GRENADE LAUNCHER,
LIKE THIS.

92
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:23,796
(Making shooting noises)

93
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:25,931
OF COURSE, WE CAN'T DO THAT.

94
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:27,433
NO?

95
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,934
NO, WE CAN'T.

96
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:31,103
YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO
AT THE LODGE?

97
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,039
WE TAKE LEAD PELLETS,
COVER THEM WITH HONEY.

98
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:36,275
GET A PIGEON TO EAT
A FEW OF THOSE

99
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,944
AND HE'S TRAVELLING ON FOOT
FOR A WHILE.

100
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:42,381
I'LL PRETEND I DIDN'T HEAR THAT,
RED.

101
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:46,385
WHAT YOU NEED IS THIS STUFF,
STICKY GREASE.

102
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,488
PIGEONS DO NOT LIKE TO PERCH
ON GOOEY STUFF.

103
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,156
SO I LOAD MY SQUIRT GUN

104
00:04:51,223 --> 00:04:53,626
WITH A BUNCH OF THIS
STICKY GREASE,

105
00:04:53,692 --> 00:04:56,896
AND THEN I SPRAY IT
ALL OVER THE EAVESTROUGHS.

106
00:04:56,962 --> 00:04:59,064
THAT GETS RID OF THE PIGEONS.

107
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:00,566
SEE, LOOK THERE.

108
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,134
THERE THEY GO NOW.

109
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,475
I'M THINKING THAT GREASE WORKS
AS A BIT OF A LAXATIVE, TOO.

110
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,812

WITH OLD MAN SEDGWICK
IN JAIL,

125
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:51,049
AND THEM HOLDING THAT
NINE-VOLT BATTERY AS EVIDENCE,

126
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:53,786
MY PLAN FOR A CABLE CAR
IS ON HOLD.

127
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:56,522
SO I'VE COME UP WITH
AN ALTERNATE PLAN.

128
00:05:56,588 --> 00:06:00,392
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW YOU CAN BUILD
ONE OF THESE YOURSELF,

129
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:04,029
EVEN IF YOU'RE LIKE ME,
NINE-VOLT BATTERY IMPAIRED.

130
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:07,533
YOU'LL NEED A SPARE TIRE
LIKE THE ONES ON YOUR CAR.

131
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:09,434
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SPARE,

132
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:11,770
HANG AROUND
THE MALL PARKING LOTS

133
00:06:11,837 --> 00:06:15,107
UNTIL SOMEBODY WITH
YOUR KIND OF CAR COMES IN.

134
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,543
TRUNKS ARE PRETTY EASY TO OPEN.

135
00:06:17,609 --> 00:06:21,213
I SUPPOSE IF ALL THE CARS
ARE NICER THAN YOURS,

136
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,415
TRY HANGING OUT AT WAL-MART.

137
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:26,485
FIRST, PRY THE TIRE
RIGHT OFF THE RIM.

138
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,489
THERE'S A GOOD REMINDER.

139
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,257
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS

140
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:34,927
TAKE THE AIR
OUT OF THE TIRE FIRST.

141
00:06:34,993 --> 00:06:36,929
(Hissing)

142
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:39,498
OH MY GOSH, THAT SMELLS...

143
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,034
OH, MUST BE
PRINCE CHARLES' TIRE.

144
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,803
SMELLS LIKE THE "AIR"
TO THE THRONE.

145
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,605
ALL RIGHT, THAT TIRE

146
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:50,275
SHOULD JUST POP RIGHT OFF
I WOULD THINK.

147
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,948
SHE'S COMING.

148
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,406
(Coughing)

149
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:23,008
IT'S JUST THAT EASY.

150
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:26,411
NOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
IS ATTACH THE RIM--

151
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:27,913
(Sizzling)

152
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:30,515
YOU WANT TO LET HER
COOL OFF A BIT.

153
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:33,618
GET A CLOTHESLINE
WITH THE CLOTHES ON IT.

154
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:35,887
THESE AREN'T HARD TO COME BY.

155
00:07:35,954 --> 00:07:38,423
ALL YOU NEED IS
A PAIR OF CUTTERS

156
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,958
AND A DARK NIGHT.

157
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:41,493
TAKE THE CLOTHES OFF.

158
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,963
THEN YOU WANT TO GET YOUR RIM
AND ATTACH THAT TO

159
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,700
THE OUTSIDE OF ONE OF
THE DRIVE WHEELS ON YOUR CAR.

160
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:50,235
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH.

161
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:52,404
YOU CAN HOLD THIS ON
WITH BOLTS,

162
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:53,972
OR WELD THAT ON THERE,

163
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:58,076
BUT REMEMBER, THERE'S GOING
TO BE PEOPLE IN THIS CABLE CAR.

164
00:07:58,143 --> 00:07:59,945
SO YOU WANT TO ATTACH THIS

165
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:02,781
WITH SOMETHING
YOU'D TRUST YOUR LIFE TO.

166
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:11,223
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
THIS IS A CAR,

167
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:14,092
AND THIS IS A CABLE...

168
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:16,194
HENCE THE TERM "CABLE CAR".

169
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:19,464
ONLY NEEDS ONE MORE THING
TO MAKE IT WORK.

170
00:08:25,704 --> 00:08:28,907
(Panting)

171
00:08:28,974 --> 00:08:32,577
A TREE AT THE TOP OF THE HILL
TO WIND THE CABLE AROUND.

172
00:08:32,644 --> 00:08:35,780
NOW, ALL'S I HAVE TO DO IS
GO BACK TO THE CAR,

173
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:37,182
ATTACH THIS TO THE FRONT.

174
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:39,951
NEXT TIME I'LL BE ABLE TO
COME UP THE HILL...

175
00:08:40,018 --> 00:08:42,153
WITHOUT WALKING.

176
00:08:49,427 --> 00:08:51,663
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO

177
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,866
IS THREAD THAT THROUGH
YOUR FRONT BUMPER,

178
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:56,368
AND SECURE THAT.

179
00:08:56,434 --> 00:08:58,370
SNUG HER RIGHT UP.

180
00:08:58,436 --> 00:08:59,871
GET HER SNUG.

181
00:08:59,938 --> 00:09:03,441
AS SOON AS I START THE ENGINE
AND POP HER INTO GEAR

182
00:09:03,508 --> 00:09:05,243
IT WILL TIGHTEN THE CABLE

183
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,046
AND THE CAR WILL
PULL ITSELF UP THE HILL

184
00:09:08,113 --> 00:09:10,482
WITH THE PASSENGERS
SAFELY INSIDE.

185
00:09:10,548 --> 00:09:13,385
THEY GOT A HEATED COMPARTMENT
IN HERE.

186
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:14,886
YOU GOT MUSIC.

187
00:09:14,953 --> 00:09:17,555
YOU GOT
YOUR BEVERAGE CONTAINERS.

188
00:09:17,622 --> 00:09:21,393
AND THE BEAUTY IS
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO STEER.

189
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:23,395
LET'S GIVE HER A TRY.

190
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:25,397
(Engine starting)

191
00:09:25,463 --> 00:09:28,466
(Engine revving)

192
00:09:36,474 --> 00:09:38,510
ALL RIGHT, THAT WAS MY FAULT.

193
00:09:38,576 --> 00:09:40,712
I JUST GOT TO ATTACH THE CABLE

194
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:42,981
TO SOMETHING
A BIT MORE SECURE.

195
00:09:59,831 --> 00:10:02,534
I REMOVED SOME OF
THE EXCESS WEIGHT.

196
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,636
IT'S GONNA RUN BETTER NOW.

197
00:10:04,702 --> 00:10:07,939
I'VE SECURED THE CABLE
TO THE FRAME.

198
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:09,774
HINDSIGHT'S ALWAYS 20-20.

199
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:12,710
USUALLY COMES FROM SOMEBODY
WHO WASN'T THERE.

200
00:10:12,777 --> 00:10:15,446
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME

201
00:10:15,513 --> 00:10:17,949
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

202
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:21,019
THEY'LL FIND ME
AT THE TOP OF THE SKI HILL.

203
00:10:21,085 --> 00:10:22,587
(Engine starting)

204
00:10:28,026 --> 00:10:29,994
(Engine revving)

205
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:52,150
STAY TUNED FOR BUZZ SHERWOOD
SAYING HELLO.

206
00:10:57,188 --> 00:11:00,425
YOU GOT NEW NEIGHBOURS
MOVING IN DOWN THE STREET.

207
00:11:00,491 --> 00:11:02,460
THEY LOOK OK FROM A DISTANCE.

208
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,863
AS YOU'RE PEERING AT THEM
THROUGH YOUR BINOCULARS

209
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,933
TO SEE IF THEIR FACES
LOOK FAMILIAR TO YOU

210
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,537
FROM TELEVISION SHOWS LIKE
"AMERICA'S MOST WANTED",

211
00:11:12,603 --> 00:11:15,773
YOUR WIFE TELLS YOU TO
PUT YOUR PANTS ON,

212
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,476
SHE'S INVITED THE NEW PEOPLE
OVER.

213
00:11:18,543 --> 00:11:19,977
I KNOW YOU'RE THINKING

214
00:11:20,044 --> 00:11:23,481
YOU ALREADY KNOW MORE PEOPLE
THAN YOU WANT TO KNOW.

215
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:25,750
AND ANYBODY
WHO WOULD BUY A HOUSE

216
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:29,620
ON THE SAME STREET AS
A CHLORINE FACTORY IS AN IDIOT,

217
00:11:29,687 --> 00:11:31,656
EXCEPT FOR YOU, OF COURSE.

218
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:35,026
BUT YOU'VE GOT
ENTIRELY THE WRONG ATTITUDE.

219
00:11:35,093 --> 00:11:37,929
WHEN THE MOVING VAN
PULLS IN, RUN OVER,

220
00:11:37,995 --> 00:11:39,430
SAY "HOWDY, NEIGHBOUR,"

221
00:11:39,497 --> 00:11:42,533
ALL THE TIME,
KEEPING AN EYE ON EVERYTHING.

222
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,436
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR POWER TOOLS,
GARDENING EQUIPMENT

223
00:11:45,503 --> 00:11:47,939
AND ESPECIALLY
A BIG-SCREEN T.V.

224
00:11:48,005 --> 00:11:51,809
WHEN IT BECOMES OBVIOUS THAT
THEY'RE BETTER OFF THAN YOU,

225
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:55,112
FIGURE OUT SOME WAY
THE FAMILIES CAN GET TOGETHER

226
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:58,449
ONCE A WEEK, EVEN MORE OFTEN
DURING THE PLAYOFFS.

227
00:11:58,516 --> 00:12:02,086
IT'S OK TO GIVE A LITTLE
AS LONG AS YOU GET A LOT.

228
00:12:02,153 --> 00:12:03,988
THAT'S CALLED FREE TRADE.

229
00:12:04,055 --> 00:12:06,057
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

230
00:12:06,123 --> 00:12:08,459
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

231
00:12:08,526 --> 00:12:10,795
(Applause)

232
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:15,566
WE GOT OLD MAN SEDGWICK
OUT OF THE HOOSEGOW,

233
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:18,636
BUT WE HAD TO SIT THROUGH
QUITE A FEW CASES.

234
00:12:18,703 --> 00:12:20,404
THE COURTROOM WAS PACKED.

235
00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:22,907
I HAVEN'T SEEN
THAT MANY OLD FRIENDS

236
00:12:22,974 --> 00:12:24,909
SINCE MY HIGH SCHOOL REUNION.

237
00:12:24,976 --> 00:12:27,211
TELL THEM ABOUT
FLINTY McCLINTOCK

238
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:30,047
PARKING HIS CAR
ON HIS NEIGHBOUR'S ROOF.

239
00:12:30,114 --> 00:12:32,083
OH NO, THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

240
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:34,085
NOT WHEN IT'S ON THE ROOF.

241
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:36,921
IN THE LIVING ROOM
OR THE LAWN MAYBE,

242
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:38,422
BUT NOT THE ROOF.

243
00:12:38,489 --> 00:12:39,924
FLINTY'S BRAKES FAILED.

244
00:12:39,991 --> 00:12:43,394
THOSE LADDERS HAPPENED
TO BE LEANING AGAINST THE HOUSE

245
00:12:43,461 --> 00:12:46,163
THE SAME DISTANCE APART
AS FLINTY'S WHEELS,

246
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,665
AND UP SHE WENT.

247
00:12:47,732 --> 00:12:49,166
IT HAPPENS.

248
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:52,136
HOW COME THE SHINGLES
WERE SO MESSED UP?

249
00:12:52,203 --> 00:12:53,871
WELL, IT TOOK HIM

250
00:12:53,938 --> 00:12:56,707
A COUPLE
OF TRIES.

251
00:12:56,774 --> 00:12:59,977
THE JUDGE WAS GOING TO
LET OLD MAN SEDGWICK OFF,

252
00:13:00,044 --> 00:13:02,413
BUT F. LEE DOOFUS
SPOKE UP FOR HIM.

253
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,916
HE GOT SENTENCED TO 100 HOURS
OF COMMUNITY SERVICE.

254
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:08,285
WE DON'T HAVE
THAT BIG A COMMUNITY.

255
00:13:08,352 --> 00:13:11,956
THAT MEANS WE EACH HAVE TO
SPEND AN HOUR WITH THE GUY,

256
00:13:12,022 --> 00:13:13,591
SO WE ALL GET PUNISHED.

257
00:13:13,657 --> 00:13:16,093
THE JUDGE RELEASED
MR. OLD MAN INTO

258
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,595
UNCLE RED'S CUSTODY.

259
00:13:17,661 --> 00:13:20,931
ARE YOU READY TO BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR A MISFIT?

260
00:13:20,998 --> 00:13:24,268
I'M PRETTY MUCH USED TO IT
ACTUALLY.

261
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:25,770
SAFETY IS EVERYTHING,

262
00:13:25,836 --> 00:13:28,739
BUT IT'S GOT NOTHING
ON BUZZ SHERWOOD.

263
00:13:28,806 --> 00:13:31,742
HEY, IT'S THE BIG RED GUY!

264
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:33,244
HAROLD!

265
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,912
THAT'S FUN.

266
00:13:34,979 --> 00:13:37,047
HEY, I GOT SOMETHING
TO SHOW YOU.

267
00:13:37,114 --> 00:13:38,816
I GOT A NEW PLANE TRAILER.

268
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:40,851
A TRAILER TO PUT
YOUR PLANE ON,

269
00:13:40,918 --> 00:13:42,119
TOW BEHIND THE CAR.

270
00:13:42,186 --> 00:13:44,922
IT'S PROBABLY A LOT SAFER
THAN FLYING HER.

271
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:47,491
NO, NO, NO,
I GOT A PLANE TRAILER.

272
00:13:47,558 --> 00:13:49,927
A TRAILER THAT MY PLANE
CAN TOW.

273
00:13:49,994 --> 00:13:52,830
YOU'RE GOING TO TOW THIS
BEHIND YOUR PLANE?

274
00:13:52,897 --> 00:13:55,833
HOW ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO GET
A BOAT TO FLY?

275
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,435
I EVEN GOT THE MIRRORS
FOR BACKING UP.

276
00:13:58,502 --> 00:14:02,306
RED, I WAS THINKING,
WITH MY PLANE TRAILER,

277
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:05,543
I CAN CARRY MORE STUFF,
MORE PEOPLE,

278
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:08,445
MAKE FEWER TRIPS,
USE LESS FUEL.

279
00:14:08,512 --> 00:14:10,447
AREN'T YOU AFRAID OF CRASHING?

280
00:14:10,514 --> 00:14:11,949
WHY?

281
00:14:12,016 --> 00:14:13,951
FROM THE EXTRA WEIGHT?

282
00:14:14,018 --> 00:14:15,953
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

283
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,922
THE EXTRA WEIGHT OF THIS UNIT

284
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:20,791
IS PROBABLY GOING TO MAKE
YOUR PLANE CRASH.

285
00:14:20,858 --> 00:14:22,293
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

286
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:25,429
YOUR PLANE CAN ONLY CARRY
SO MANY POUNDS, RIGHT?

287
00:14:25,496 --> 00:14:28,232
WHICH IS SO GREAT
ABOUT THE PLANE TRAILER.

288
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:30,301
IT TAKES ALL THE EXTRA WEIGHT.

289
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:32,770
YEAH, BUT IT'S ATTACHED
TO THE PLANE.

290
00:14:32,836 --> 00:14:36,073
WHICH DOESN'T HAVE TO
CARRY A THING.

291
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,409
ALL RIGHT, OK,
MAYBE I'M WRONG.

292
00:14:38,475 --> 00:14:39,910
YOU CARRY ON.

293
00:14:39,977 --> 00:14:41,345
JUST DO ME A FAVOUR.

294
00:14:41,412 --> 00:14:44,615
DON'T FLY THIS STUFF
OVER THE LODGE, ALL RIGHT?

295
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:46,183
RIGHT, RIGHT, SURE.

296
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:52,823
OLD MAN SEDGWICK
SEEMS TO BE DOING OK

297
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,925
WITH HIS MANDATORY
COMMUNITY SERVICE.

298
00:14:54,992 --> 00:14:57,294
HE VOLUNTEERED
AS A CROSSING GUARD

299
00:14:57,361 --> 00:14:58,962
IN FRONT OF THE LEGION.

300
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:00,898
IT'S ODD TO SEE THOSE GUYS

301
00:15:00,964 --> 00:15:02,499
WHO SERVED IN COMBAT

302
00:15:02,566 --> 00:15:06,136
TO HAVE TO ASK PERMISSION
TO CROSS THE STREET.

303
00:15:06,203 --> 00:15:08,505
HE'S GONNA GET SOMEBODY KILLED.

304
00:15:08,572 --> 00:15:12,109
HE'S GOT EVERYBODY WAITING
TILL A VEHICLE COMES.

305
00:15:12,176 --> 00:15:14,278
THEN HE JUMPS IN FRONT OF IT

306
00:15:14,344 --> 00:15:16,980
WITH A BIG SIGN
MAKING BIG GESTURES.

307
00:15:17,047 --> 00:15:18,449
BIG STUFF, BIG WOW!

308
00:15:18,515 --> 00:15:20,117
IT'S CHILDISH.

309
00:15:20,184 --> 00:15:21,585
HE'S A CROSSING GUARD.

310
00:15:21,652 --> 00:15:24,822
IF HE DOESN'T STOP TRAFFIC,
HE SERVES NO PURPOSE.

311
00:15:24,888 --> 00:15:27,825
IT WOULD BE LIKE
IF YOU DIDN'T SELL THIS SHOW

312
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:29,393
TO A MAJOR
NETWORK.

313
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,795
I DIDN'T.
EXACTLY.

314
00:15:31,862 --> 00:15:33,597
WE DID HAVE ONE SET-BACK.

315
00:15:33,664 --> 00:15:36,166
OLD MAN SEDGWICK
STOLE THE STOP SIGN

316
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:38,302
AND A FEW OF THE GUYS MEDALS.

317
00:15:38,368 --> 00:15:39,803
HE'S A KLEPTO.

318
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,105
HE NEEDS HELP,
LIKE A PSYCHOLOGIST.

319
00:15:42,172 --> 00:15:44,208
A PSYCHOLOGIST JUST MOVED HERE.

320
00:15:44,274 --> 00:15:45,709
DR. STAN.

321
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:47,211
HE'S QUITE GOOD.

322
00:15:47,277 --> 00:15:48,712
VERY COMFORTABLE CHAIRS.

323
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:50,714
(Audience laughing)

324
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:53,383
I THINK I CAN GET HIM
AN APPOINTMENT

325
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,419
FOR ROUGHLY 2:45 TOMORROW.

326
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:57,621
THERE COULD BE A CANCELLATION.

327
00:15:57,688 --> 00:15:59,623
NO, HAROLD.

328
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,226
I'LL TAKE OLD MAN SEDGWICK
TO MY HOUSE,

329
00:16:02,292 --> 00:16:03,894
LET MY WIFE LOOK AT HIM.

330
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:05,829
BERNICE IS GOOD WITH PEOPLE.

331
00:16:05,896 --> 00:16:09,099
SHE USUALLY KNOWS
WHAT TO DO WITH A NUT-CASE.

332
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,601
MARRIES
'EM?

333
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:12,102
(Laughing)

334
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:13,870
THIS IS A CLAW HAMMER.

335
00:16:13,937 --> 00:16:17,074
THE HAMMER PART IS FOR
BANGING NAILS IN.

336
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,510
THE CLAW PART IS FOR
TAKING NAILS OUT.

337
00:16:22,512 --> 00:16:24,281
AS I TOLD YOU EARLIER,

338
00:16:24,348 --> 00:16:26,383
BILL'S GOING TO SHOW US

339
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,086
HOW TO WATCH OUT
FOR PICKPOCKETS.

340
00:16:29,152 --> 00:16:32,990
HE'S PRETENDING TO BE FRIENDLY,
PATTING AROUND.

341
00:16:33,056 --> 00:16:35,425
YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING,
DON'T YA?

342
00:16:35,492 --> 00:16:37,894
HE'S TRYING TO
STEAL STUFF FROM ME.

343
00:16:37,961 --> 00:16:39,629
HE HAD MY WATCH.

344
00:16:39,696 --> 00:16:44,434
HE GRABBED MY WALLET,
MY PEN KNIFE AND SO ON.

345
00:16:44,501 --> 00:16:47,070
CAR KEYS --
UNBELIEVABLE WHAT HE CAN DO.

346
00:16:47,137 --> 00:16:48,405
SOME CHANGE AND SO ON.

347
00:16:48,472 --> 00:16:49,873
AND...

348
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,375
OH, MY GOSH.

349
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:53,877
I GUESS I HAD A HOLE
IN ONE OF THE POCKETS.

350
00:16:53,944 --> 00:16:56,079
AND WHAT...

351
00:16:56,146 --> 00:16:57,581
MY SOCKS.

352
00:16:57,647 --> 00:16:59,082
HOW... HOW... HOW...

353
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:01,685
HE TOOK MY SOCKS AND SHOES
RIGHT OFF.

354
00:17:01,752 --> 00:17:03,353
THAT IS SLEIGHT OF HAND.

355
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,424
HE'D GONE THROUGH, APPARENTLY,
ALL THE GUYS IN THE LODGE.

356
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:10,026
I GUESS SOMEBODY HAD BEEN
ON THE PHONE

357
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:12,462
WHEN HE WAS DOING
THE PICKPOCKET WITH THEM.

358
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:14,531
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE, ISN'T IT?

359
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:16,032
APPARENTLY, THEY SAY,

360
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:18,268
THE HAND IS QUICKER
THAN THE EYE.

361
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,769
THERE'S A FUNNEL.

362
00:17:19,836 --> 00:17:21,271
SOMEBODY HAD THE TOWEL.

363
00:17:21,338 --> 00:17:22,772
THE ROLLERBLADES.

364
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,574
BY GOLLY, THAT'S AMAZING.

365
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:27,043
BILL IS VERY GOOD
WITH HIS FINGERS.

366
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,147
NOT REALLY ALL THAT GOOD
WITH HIS HEAD.

367
00:17:30,213 --> 00:17:31,982
SOMEBODY HAD THE PAIL THERE.

368
00:17:32,048 --> 00:17:35,552
HE TOOK THAT OUT OF
SOMEBODY'S POCKET.

369
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:38,555
NOW HE'S GOING TO
SHOW ME HOW TO DO IT.

370
00:17:38,622 --> 00:17:41,725
HE'S SAYING TO ME,
"IT'S JUST THAT EASY."

371
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,727
I'VE GOT A TRICK FOR HIM.

372
00:17:43,793 --> 00:17:45,996
(Laughing)

373
00:17:46,062 --> 00:17:47,497
OH, YOU'RE FINE.

374
00:17:47,564 --> 00:17:48,999
OH, YOU'RE FINE.

375
00:17:49,065 --> 00:17:51,034
GETTING BACK TO MY LESSON.

376
00:17:51,101 --> 00:17:53,303
HE'S SAYING,
"YOU JUST GRAB IT

377
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,373
"BETWEEN A COUPLE OF FINGERS
LIKE THAT."

378
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:58,108
HE WANTS ME TO TRY IT.

379
00:17:58,174 --> 00:17:59,910
HE'S GOT THE WALLET.

380
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:02,412
IT'S NOT THAT HARD --
BUT LOOK.

381
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:04,414
HE THINKS HE'S SO SMART.

382
00:18:04,481 --> 00:18:05,815
OH YEAH, OH BILL.

383
00:18:05,882 --> 00:18:08,251
YOU ARE THE EPITOME OF FUNNY.

384
00:18:08,318 --> 00:18:11,454
I'M GOING TO HOOK
THE WHOLE UNIT THERE

385
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:15,592
ONTO SOMETHING THAT CAN GET
THIS WALLET PULLED OUT.

386
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:17,427
HOOK THAT ONTO MY RAD.

387
00:18:17,494 --> 00:18:20,163
SOMETHING THAT'S NOT RUSTED OUT
TOO BAD.

388
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:23,400
LET'S SEE HOW MUCH TRACTION
THE OLD GIRL'S GOT.

389
00:18:23,466 --> 00:18:25,635
GOT THE BIG EIGHT IN HER.

390
00:18:25,702 --> 00:18:28,104
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
YOU WANNA HANG ONTO

391
00:18:28,171 --> 00:18:29,606
YOUR MONEY, HUH?

392
00:18:29,673 --> 00:18:32,442
YOU'D BETTER GUARD YOUR HEALTH,
YOUNG MAN.

393
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:34,110
I GOT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT.

394
00:18:34,177 --> 00:18:36,379
IT'S REALLY DIGGING IN,
BUT, UH...

395
00:18:36,446 --> 00:18:38,782
HIS CLOTHES WEREN'T.

396
00:18:38,848 --> 00:18:42,886
I'LL BE CLEANING THE WINDSHIELD
TILL A YEAR FROM TUESDAY.

397
00:18:42,952 --> 00:18:45,121
I DIDN'T JUST PICK HIS POCKET.

398
00:18:45,188 --> 00:18:48,291
I PICKED HIS WARDROBE,
INCLUDING EVERYTHING.

399
00:18:48,358 --> 00:18:51,261
AND I MEAN EVERYTHING.

400
00:18:51,327 --> 00:18:52,996
OH MY GOSH.

401
00:18:53,063 --> 00:18:56,199
HE'S PACKING HEAT.

402
00:18:56,266 --> 00:18:58,568
HERE'S A WORD WE USE LOT,

403
00:18:58,635 --> 00:19:00,470
EXCEPT IT'S SPELLED WRONG.

404
00:19:05,442 --> 00:19:09,479
BERNICE PRETTY MUCH HAD
OLD MAN SEDGWICK FIGURED OUT.

405
00:19:09,546 --> 00:19:11,147
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE?

406
00:19:11,214 --> 00:19:13,416
'CAUSE SESSIONS CAN BE LONG.

407
00:19:13,483 --> 00:19:15,418
OFTEN IT TAKES FOUR HOURS

408
00:19:15,485 --> 00:19:17,921
TO GET INTO
THE TRUE INNER SELF.

409
00:19:17,987 --> 00:19:20,523
OH, NOT WITH BERNICE
IT DOESN'T.

410
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,258
SHE WOULDN'T LET HIM IN.

411
00:19:22,325 --> 00:19:24,794
SHE WAS AFRAID
HE'D STEAL SOMETHING.

412
00:19:24,861 --> 00:19:28,398
SHE SAID EVERYTHING MEN DO
IS A SHOUT FOR ATTENTION.

413
00:19:28,464 --> 00:19:31,367
WE HAVE TO SPEND TIME
WITH OLD MAN SEDGWICK.

414
00:19:31,434 --> 00:19:33,169
THEN HE'LL STOP STEALING.

415
00:19:33,236 --> 00:19:35,638
IT IS RARELY THAT SIMPLE,
UNCLE RED.

416
00:19:35,705 --> 00:19:37,140
DR. STAN SAYS --

417
00:19:37,207 --> 00:19:40,543
OR I ASSUME HE'D SAY --
THAT OLD MAN SEDGWICK

418
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:43,479
IS GOING THROUGH
A DIFFICULT TRANSITION PERIOD,

419
00:19:43,546 --> 00:19:45,982
COMPOUNDED BY
HIS FEAR OF GIRLS

420
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:47,817
AND BAD SKIN.

421
00:19:47,884 --> 00:19:50,119
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU, HAROLD.

422
00:19:50,186 --> 00:19:53,523
HE SHOULD TRY PRIMAL SCREAMING
IN A CRYSTAL PYRAMID.

423
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,459
WAAAA!

424
00:19:56,526 --> 00:19:58,728
AAAAAH!

425
00:20:00,063 --> 00:20:02,365
HAAAA AHHH!

426
00:20:02,432 --> 00:20:04,000
AH!

427
00:20:04,067 --> 00:20:05,601
HAAA!

428
00:20:05,668 --> 00:20:07,103
I THINK IT'S--

429
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,005
HAAAA!

430
00:20:11,007 --> 00:20:15,478
SOUNDS LIKE IT'S TIME TO GO
A SIZE UP ON THE PANTS TO ME.

431
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:17,914
I THINK WE'VE
TURNED THE CORNER

432
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,716
WITH OLD MAN SEDGWICK.

433
00:20:19,782 --> 00:20:23,086
HIS STEALING DAYS ARE OVER
AS FAR AS I CAN SEE.

434
00:20:23,152 --> 00:20:24,587
YEAH, RIGHT, OK.

435
00:20:24,654 --> 00:20:27,457
WHERE ARE YOUR SUSPENDERS?

436
00:20:27,523 --> 00:20:29,959
THE GUY'S A BORN THIEF.

437
00:20:30,026 --> 00:20:31,461
HEY!

438
00:20:31,527 --> 00:20:33,529
UNCLE RED.

439
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,932
THIS IS THE BIG ONE.

440
00:20:35,998 --> 00:20:39,469
YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO WIN
TWO DOZEN DAY-OLD DOUGHNUTS.

441
00:20:39,535 --> 00:20:40,903
IT'S THE BONUS ROUND.

442
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,872
WHOA, BABY.

443
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:46,342
OK, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO MAKE MY UNCLE

444
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:48,044
SAY THIS WORD.

445
00:20:49,512 --> 00:20:51,814
OK, 30 SECONDS, GO.

446
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:53,316
DEPENDABILITY.

447
00:20:53,382 --> 00:20:54,817
MADE IN
JAPAN.

448
00:20:54,884 --> 00:20:57,220
IN GOD WE...

449
00:20:57,286 --> 00:20:59,455
FEAR.

450
00:20:59,522 --> 00:21:02,892
YOU'VE GOT MONEY TO GIVE
YOUR KIDS, YOU PUT IT IN A...

451
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:04,660
SOCK DRAWER.

452
00:21:04,727 --> 00:21:06,596
NO!

453
00:21:06,662 --> 00:21:08,998
HAROLD IS YOUR ASSISTANT.

454
00:21:09,065 --> 00:21:10,500
YOU WHAT HIM?

455
00:21:10,566 --> 00:21:12,768
MAKE FUN OF HIM,
LAUGH AT HIM.

456
00:21:12,835 --> 00:21:15,938
OK, OK, HE PRODUCES,
HE DIRECTS THE SHOW.

457
00:21:16,005 --> 00:21:17,440
THAT'S BECAUSE...

458
00:21:17,507 --> 00:21:19,742
I WANT HIM OUT
OF MY FACE.

459
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:22,545
YOU GIVE HAROLD
SOMETHING TO DO.

460
00:21:22,612 --> 00:21:25,448
HE BOTCHES IT UP --
WHAT ARE YOUR FIRST WORDS?

461
00:21:25,514 --> 00:21:26,949
TRUST YOU
TO SCREW--

462
00:21:27,016 --> 00:21:28,451
YES, YES, YES!

463
00:21:28,517 --> 00:21:31,354
DOUGHNUTS!

464
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:34,957
WE GAVE IT AN HONEST TRY.

465
00:21:35,024 --> 00:21:36,359
THE GUYS TOOK TURNS

466
00:21:36,425 --> 00:21:39,095
SPENDING TIME
AT OLD MAN SEDGWICK'S HOUSE.

467
00:21:39,161 --> 00:21:41,464
WE REALIZED WHY
WE TRY TO AVOID HIM.

468
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:42,965
THAT'S
CRUEL.

469
00:21:43,032 --> 00:21:44,533
YOU SHOULD BE TOLERANT,

470
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,603
AND NOT AVOID PEOPLE
'CAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT.

471
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,538
HOW IS DR. STAN ANYWAY?

472
00:21:49,605 --> 00:21:52,074
GOOD -- HE SAYS HELLO.

473
00:21:52,141 --> 00:21:54,210
WE CURED HIM
OF HIS KLEPTOMANIA.

474
00:21:54,277 --> 00:21:58,247
WHILE WE WERE AT HIS HOUSE,
WE NOTICED HE'S GOT NICE STUFF.

475
00:21:58,314 --> 00:22:01,183
EVERY TIME OLD MAN SEDGWICK
STOLE SOMETHING,

476
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,685
WE'D STEAL FROM HIM.

477
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,254
WHEN HE RETURNED IT,
WE'D GIVE HIS BACK.

478
00:22:05,321 --> 00:22:07,089
THAT'S A PROVEN TECHNIQUE

479
00:22:07,156 --> 00:22:08,924
FOR SOLVING
PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS

480
00:22:08,991 --> 00:22:12,094
THAT ARE BEHAVIOURAL
RATHER THAN CLINICAL.

481
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:15,598
(Bell ringing)

482
00:22:15,664 --> 00:22:17,099
WHAT'S
THAT FOR?

483
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:20,936
TO SEE IF IT MAKES YOU DROOL.

484
00:22:21,003 --> 00:22:23,839
OLD MAN SEDGWICK
REALIZED THAT HIS THIEVING

485
00:22:23,906 --> 00:22:25,875
WAS CAUSING HIM TO BE ROBBED.

486
00:22:25,941 --> 00:22:29,445
HE CUT OUT THE MIDDLE MAN
AND STOP SWIPING STUFF.

487
00:22:29,512 --> 00:22:30,946
(Possum
squeal)

488
00:22:31,013 --> 00:22:32,448
MEETING
TIME.

489
00:22:32,515 --> 00:22:35,117
I'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.

490
00:22:35,184 --> 00:22:36,652
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

491
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:38,687
I'LL BE HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

492
00:22:38,754 --> 00:22:40,923
IN THE SPIRIT OF
OLD MAN SEDGWICK,

493
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:43,959
I'LL TAKE ANOTHER SHOT
AT STEALING YOUR HEART,

494
00:22:44,026 --> 00:22:46,695
WHICH WILL SIGNIFY THAT
I NEED ATTENTION.

495
00:22:46,762 --> 00:22:48,197
(Bell ringing)

496
00:22:48,264 --> 00:22:51,333
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

497
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,470
ON BEHALF OF HAROLD
AND MYSELF AND THE GANG,

498
00:22:54,537 --> 00:22:56,472
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

499
00:22:56,539 --> 00:23:00,543
(Applause)

500
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:02,044
(Possum squeal)

501
00:23:02,111 --> 00:23:04,046
(Harold): ALL RISE.

502
00:23:07,483 --> 00:23:13,222
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.
