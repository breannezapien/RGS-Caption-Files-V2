1
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,107
Lights, camera

2
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:46,279
Action. She was a credits roll, the audience
and whatever you're supposed to do do that

3
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:50,350
and what because it's time for the red green
showing a hundred thousand fingers, just push

4
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,653
the record button and about 20 or 30 just
push the pause button.

5
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:56,890
But they won't even notice. Take the Marlin
and try and play it back and go, Hey, what's

6
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,491
going on there anyway?

7
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:03,396
Taking a pause button, here's the man whom I
like to call the man from uncle, because

8
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,065
that's basically what he is to me, but he's
also the star of the show.

9
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:08,201
Here he is. I'm also confused at this point.

10
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,602
Red. Green.

11
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:15,541
Harold, thank you and welcome to Possible
Hodge.

12
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:19,846
Any of you just heard that introduction will
already have guessed that Harold is a

13
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:22,949
relative and there's a huge favor involved
in his working on the show here.

14
00:01:23,182 --> 00:01:24,550
Well, I don't consider this a favor.

15
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,186
I enjoy like directing and producing and
doing this stuff.

16
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,894
Don't worry, as soon as his salary adds up to
what I owe his father, he's out of here and

17
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:37,397
kind of an interesting week up at the Lodge
this week.

18
00:01:37,563 --> 00:01:40,199
Something strange going on with helmet our
maintenance man.

19
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:43,670
I usually helmet spends his days kind of
tinkering around making adjustments to the

20
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,738
water pump to the point where it doesn't
work at all.

21
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:50,009
This week he hasn't been doing any
maintenance, so actually everything's working

22
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,110
pretty good up at the lodge.

23
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,681
It kind of proves that saying that we always
use on helmet, which is if it ain't broke,

24
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,783
too bad, don't total it off.

25
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,819
I think helmets and L-O-V-E.

26
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:03,790
I know the signs and not just with his
mother, which you know is good.

27
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:08,127
We don't actually talk much about love up
here at the lodge.

28
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,896
Sex, yes. Love no.

29
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:15,001
Love to us is kind of private and
potentially embarrassing, whereas sex is more

30
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,068
or less public domain.

31
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:17,870
I don't know. I think sex is

32
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,240
Every bit as much private as love is, maybe
even more so.

33
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,376
It certainly isn't something you want to
share with a group.

34
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,479
Well, then you've never been to the large
Christmas party, have you, Harold?

35
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,817
Oh, don't start talking about the Christmas
party to me.

36
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,920
No. Oh ho, ho, ho.

37
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,190
I get that one. Is there anything under the
Christmas tree for me?

38
00:02:37,523 --> 00:02:40,059
Oh hey, it's the wrong size.

39
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,260
Oh la la la.

40
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,062
Shut up, Harold. All righty.

41
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,602
I'll take five.

42
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:54,807
Do you have a bad hand, do you all little
ones for twos and a three?

43
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:59,312
Give me two bill. I am fine.

44
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:08,020
Three. What do you think?

45
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,255
I think Bill should make a decision.

46
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,492
Oh, my corsage made it for my date tonight.

47
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:15,628
I sent a corsage. That's a duck blind.

48
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:17,663
Well, you want to get your date out of her
dress.

49
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,932
Pin that on to her. Let gravity do the rest.

50
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,269
Okay, look at Ray's helmet.

51
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,972
You have a date. Yeah, why not?

52
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:30,042
I just you know who? And who knew a girl
would actually say, You know what?

53
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:34,947
I was thinking, Oh, second, one time I think
I was thinking, What a lovely corsage you

54
00:03:34,947 --> 00:03:37,049
made. I was thinking that I say that and I
said it to you.

55
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,384
You know what else I was thinking? How
generous.

56
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:41,620
All right, I'll raise.

57
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:43,456
So who's the lucky woman?

58
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:48,227
Let me guess lady wrestler Rita Frommer.

59
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:50,830
Rita Frommer, the pie lady.

60
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,531
Yeah, oh man.

61
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:55,668
She's hot. She's about a nine nine.

62
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:57,002
That's German for no.

63
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,538
She's like Suzanne Somers on Three's
Company.

64
00:04:00,806 --> 00:04:07,379
Only she's brunette and she's shorter, and
she's like the other one on Three's Company.

65
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,248
Yeah, yeah. John Ritter.

66
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:12,985
Ok, look, he's such a little cutie with a
bakery.

67
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,554
Rita's bun. How is it? That's right.

68
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:19,558
Oh. You got a date with her.

69
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,293
I've had my eye on her for years.

70
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,963
How did you get her to go out with you?
Yeah. You know, I go in there by Danish from

71
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,164
her just to see her in that little apron
thing.

72
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:27,967
Did you get her to go out with you?

73
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:29,802
I asked her. Oh yeah.

74
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:37,142
She insisted on bringing her twin sister,
though, you know, as a chaperone.

75
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:39,545
Oh, just in case you accidentally sat on
her, huh?

76
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,548
Ok, look, I call. What have you got?

77
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,050
Mm hmm. Uh huh.. Hey.

78
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:46,819
Ok, that's mine.

79
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:50,055
I'm good. I actually just close the store
and become a professional gambler.

80
00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:52,725
What about me? Well, I'll close the store
with you in it.

81
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:56,228
Oh yeah, the bun lady's got a twin sister,
huh?

82
00:04:57,062 --> 00:05:00,266
Yeah. Leslie. Well, she said they're not
identical twins.

83
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:04,603
Leslie's blonde. Oh, long lines.

84
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:07,172
Good. Well, why don't we make this a double
date?

85
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,576
I don't know if Leslie like that.

86
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,580
Well, I I could go as your chaperone.

87
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,883
Yeah. Like, you know, I'll bring the RV.

88
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:22,621
I'll stop the bank, get some money at the
Drive-Thru, bring a picnic lunch.

89
00:05:22,888 --> 00:05:24,990
Maybe later we'll go to the drive in, watch
a play.

90
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:29,228
Well, I made dinner reservations at that new
Chinese Italian place there.

91
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:30,929
Chop Louie's Bamboo Pizzeria.

92
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,899
We got to drive through. Wow.

93
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,435
Look, I think you shouldn't show up with
Glenn now.

94
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:37,636
I think you should take me there.

95
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:41,407
Oh man, come on. I can get you a real
corsage just from the store for free.

96
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,476
No charge and I'll get you a nice suit all
set up there in a suit.

97
00:05:44,543 --> 00:05:45,944
Yeah. Well, what's wrong with what I'm
wearing?

98
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:49,181
Well, nothing. If you plan on taking or
dancing in an open pit mine.

99
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,285
Get your R.V. ready, Glenn.

100
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,090
It is this evening's got to be special.

101
00:05:58,223 --> 00:06:01,860
Clean the tire treads if you have no problem
read can I borrow some of your clothes?

102
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,163
What the cleaning tire treads with no to
work.

103
00:06:05,497 --> 00:06:09,568
How will that know you guys have a great
time on your date?

104
00:06:10,068 --> 00:06:11,136
Don't know anything I do.

105
00:06:12,237 --> 00:06:16,074
All right, you boys. You might be interested
in trying some of these Murray's own

106
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:18,677
aphrodisiacs. Guaranteed to give you a power
and stamina.

107
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:21,213
Murray, these are nice girls.

108
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,948
Oh, I don't know.

109
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:28,487
P e z.

110
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:32,591
Yeah, that's that's so that's French, you
don't you know, yeah, that's French for

111
00:06:32,591 --> 00:06:34,092
Putin. All right.

112
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:41,333
Let's roll. Yeah, I thought we'd take a
bullet.

113
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:44,303
Good idea. Women love to go bowling.

114
00:06:44,603 --> 00:06:46,038
You know, I think they got a drive through
there.

115
00:06:47,606 --> 00:06:48,907
You want to stop it, Mr Huge, and get a
tuxedo.

116
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:50,742
Oh, maybe good.

117
00:06:57,382 --> 00:07:04,489
The rope that hangs from the old oak tree was
once the noose for Arlo McGee.

118
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,026
He hanged for three days quite a long
duration.

119
00:07:09,895 --> 00:07:17,369
The winds swung them around like a bird
feeding station, and this is one of the songs

120
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:25,310
they sung for a man who wasn't well groomed
or well-behaved, but certainly well hung.

121
00:07:36,054 --> 00:07:41,460
This week on and in our corner, I'm going to
show you how to turn your home into a castle

122
00:07:41,827 --> 00:07:47,632
by using fancy decorative trim, because
almost every castle that I've ever seen the

123
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:51,803
pictures, you know, I've always had fancy
trim on the outside, up off the walls and

124
00:07:51,803 --> 00:07:53,772
across the tops and inside as well.

125
00:07:53,872 --> 00:07:58,009
And 90 percent of that fancy trim is made
with plaster, and that's something that

126
00:07:58,009 --> 00:07:59,411
peasants like you and me can do.

127
00:08:00,145 --> 00:08:04,783
What I have here is a bag of plaster of
Paris, but the instructions are in English

128
00:08:04,783 --> 00:08:07,385
to, you know, nothing, any nothing, any
handy man.

129
00:08:07,385 --> 00:08:08,987
I know whatever. Thanks to reading
instructions.

130
00:08:11,556 --> 00:08:14,426
Mix that up and just goes in with water, I
think.

131
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,796
I suppose you could use turps on this if
you're in a hurry.

132
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:21,399
That seems that seems about right.

133
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:22,634
Nice and portable.

134
00:08:23,768 --> 00:08:27,939
Ok, now we're going to need something to use
as a mall.

135
00:08:28,273 --> 00:08:32,344
What I want to make here is some sort of a
round decorative flower design or something

136
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:35,046
like that. Go on either side of the
fireplace, I think look real sharp.

137
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:38,016
So something maybe here we don't agree on.

138
00:08:39,884 --> 00:08:41,253
I like using hubcaps.

139
00:08:41,286 --> 00:08:45,690
You know, I particularly recommend the big
three mid to late sixties.

140
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,093
You know, there are real, real sharp looking
unit.

141
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:54,633
Put that down there and we just put our
plaster right in there.

142
00:08:57,569 --> 00:09:05,076
Oh, I guess the pasture, Paris, that's a
little faster than I thought it did, huh?

143
00:09:06,177 --> 00:09:09,214
Well, maybe I'll just take a look at those
instructions and we'll whip up another batch.

144
00:09:14,586 --> 00:09:19,224
Ok, well, according to the box, once you mix
it up like this, it sets in about 10 minutes,

145
00:09:19,257 --> 00:09:22,827
so I better get right on that.

146
00:09:22,994 --> 00:09:24,662
So I'll just put this in right into my
hubcap.

147
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,634
Ok, bye.

148
00:09:30,535 --> 00:09:31,970
Maybe I made a little too much here.

149
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:36,241
I wish I had all four hubcaps and I would
have it the guy had parked longer.

150
00:09:37,642 --> 00:09:40,578
I don't have much time here.

151
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,385
I can sort all that stuff out later when I
got left about eight, eight minutes, eight

152
00:09:47,385 --> 00:09:50,121
and a half minutes, something like that. All
right.

153
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:52,357
What else? Just get me.

154
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:03,968
All right. And I got a garbage can lid here.

155
00:10:05,436 --> 00:10:06,571
I don't know quite what that is.

156
00:10:06,738 --> 00:10:08,072
Oh, that's a goalie's man. That would be
ideal.

157
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:12,076
Shovel helmet.

158
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:15,346
Six minutes. Five minutes What?

159
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,215
I got left. Oh, OK.

160
00:10:23,354 --> 00:10:23,855
Mm hmm.

161
00:10:28,226 --> 00:10:29,561
Five minutes, I miss left.

162
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:38,536
Ok, I think it should be dry, but I'll just
check it.

163
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:46,210
No, I guess I could use a few more minutes.

164
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:55,753
Oh oh, oh oh, oh OK.

165
00:10:57,689 --> 00:10:59,824
Just put a little time in there waiting for
the blast.

166
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,428
Oh good. We should be in good shape now.

167
00:11:04,128 --> 00:11:05,930
All right. All right.

168
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:06,497
Yes.

169
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:08,433
Well, by golly,

170
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:12,370
I think we got her look at this.

171
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:16,307
Look at this. You just take that off there
real easy.

172
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,711
Is that attractive? What does that say to
you?

173
00:11:19,777 --> 00:11:22,080
Does that say money? Does that say Roland
and money to you?

174
00:11:22,914 --> 00:11:26,551
Look that up on, you know, that looks like
it's one of those classic drama things they

175
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:31,756
have. They have tragedy in all those be and
they got the tragedy his way and the comedy.

176
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,459
And then you get with this one, which would
be shut

177
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:34,759
Out

178
00:11:36,227 --> 00:11:39,597
Or could make a dandy clock, but the hands
right on the nose?

179
00:11:39,997 --> 00:11:40,465
We got her.

180
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,100
Oh my god.

181
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:45,903
Oh, take a look at that.

182
00:11:45,937 --> 00:11:48,105
Be still my heart. Isn't that a beauty?

183
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,843
Now that that could also be a clock, I would
put that clock.

184
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,679
I put that clock anywhere. I put that right
on the front of my car.

185
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:56,881
That is a beautiful, beautiful thing.

186
00:11:57,915 --> 00:12:03,921
And well, here's here's another thing we're
in the kind of a clock motif here.

187
00:12:04,388 --> 00:12:07,291
How about this? That's a sundial.

188
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:17,001
On the other thing is these here are more of
a I guess they're more of a fun, more of a

189
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:20,371
training, not really something big enough to
make a clock out of

190
00:12:21,505 --> 00:12:21,672
A

191
00:12:21,672 --> 00:12:26,377
Watch you can make. You can make a watch out
of these, maybe make watches for all your

192
00:12:26,377 --> 00:12:33,050
friends. So this is obviously the perfect
kind of hobby for anybody who cares what time

193
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:38,556
it is. Remember the next time women to find
a handsome, and he should at least find your

194
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:40,858
handy line of.

195
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:54,305
I hate this crap. But

196
00:12:55,072 --> 00:12:57,174
it is autumn harvest time.

197
00:12:57,575 --> 00:13:02,480
Little seeds have grown to bulbous pumpkins,
the tiny flower buds on the apple tree have

198
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,751
ripened into delicious fruit, and the couch
potatoes have grown another gem.

199
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:15,926
Well, by golly, this double date is turned
into a real big deal.

200
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,831
Glenn asked me to go down to Murray's store
and get a corsage or chocolates, both of

201
00:13:20,831 --> 00:13:22,500
which he'll probably eat on the way there.

202
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,303
And then he and Helmut went off to make
themselves look presentable.

203
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,240
They went down to Glen's marina because he's
got the power tools there that they're going

204
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,678
to need. And now the whole south end of the
lake and the covered with aftershave, Buster

205
00:13:34,678 --> 00:13:37,915
said he hears some chainsaws going, so I
figure they're probably shaving their entire

206
00:13:37,915 --> 00:13:39,450
bodies to make themselves look thinner.

207
00:13:40,117 --> 00:13:41,018
So I think it's excellent

208
00:13:41,018 --> 00:13:43,821
To have taken pride in their appearance
because after all, clothes

209
00:13:43,821 --> 00:13:46,223
Make the man well, then say Hello, Mr.

210
00:13:46,223 --> 00:13:46,790
Doofus,

211
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,361
I dress like this. So the show has a look.

212
00:13:51,195 --> 00:13:52,329
Well, it's not working here. Nobody's
looking.

213
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:55,199
Can I go change? I'll change if it helps the
show.

214
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:59,169
Well, yeah, if we could do the show while you
were changing, that would help.

215
00:13:59,169 --> 00:14:01,472
Yeah, you can't.

216
00:14:01,672 --> 00:14:03,741
You're kidding. Go on.

217
00:14:03,874 --> 00:14:06,443
Good. Because actually people think I'm
quite a fashion plate.

218
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:08,078
Well, I think you're quite a roasting pan.

219
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:10,447
You got. You get it again.

220
00:14:10,848 --> 00:14:12,049
Let's go to one roast.

221
00:14:12,082 --> 00:14:13,517
That's funny. You're a nut ball.

222
00:14:14,218 --> 00:14:14,852
Shut up, Harold.

223
00:14:15,352 --> 00:14:18,622
Got me again. Good.

224
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:30,534
Oh, hello, Richard.

225
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:32,536
What can I do to you today, I read.

226
00:14:32,836 --> 00:14:36,273
How's it going, man? Really slow things are
going great.

227
00:14:36,273 --> 00:14:37,308
Business is booming now.

228
00:14:37,308 --> 00:14:39,209
What can I tell you? I read, We're very busy
here.

229
00:14:40,611 --> 00:14:41,712
Well, I'm just here for Glenn.

230
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:44,715
I was going to get him some chocolates or
some flowers, you know, for that, for that

231
00:14:44,715 --> 00:14:45,783
big day to his tonight.

232
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,518
Well, we're out of chocolates.

233
00:14:47,685 --> 00:14:49,720
We have plenty of chocolates.

234
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:53,791
You ate the last box during the all night
Mod Squad reruns.

235
00:14:54,258 --> 00:14:55,659
Well, they were awful.

236
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:58,128
You know, I find box chocolates are so
inferior.

237
00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:00,330
Luckily, I still have some canned
chocolates.

238
00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:03,267
Can chocolates, can

239
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:06,403
Chocolates there in the store room, on the
second shelf, in the back?

240
00:15:06,603 --> 00:15:09,773
Ok, Lansdale really go for these.

241
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,776
I mean, they're a little more expensive, but
who can put a price on love?

242
00:15:13,377 --> 00:15:14,344
Well, I imagine you could.

243
00:15:14,344 --> 00:15:18,549
Murray can't find them for the love of Mike.

244
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:21,151
They're right there on the second shelf, at
the back.

245
00:15:21,852 --> 00:15:23,821
There they are, right in front of your face.

246
00:15:24,254 --> 00:15:25,923
These are baked beans.

247
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:27,057
Well, they're labeled wrong.

248
00:15:27,624 --> 00:15:28,826
I'll take 30 percent off.

249
00:15:28,926 --> 00:15:30,294
No. 20 percent. 10.

250
00:15:30,294 --> 00:15:31,395
I'll take 10 percent off.

251
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,698
So maybe we should crack them up and make
sure their chocolates

252
00:15:35,165 --> 00:15:36,300
And lose the freshness.

253
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,769
Oh man, that's the whole point behind canned
chocolates.

254
00:15:40,571 --> 00:15:43,841
You know, Murray, I think we're going to just
forget about chocolates and even forget about

255
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:46,610
flowers. I think that'll do better if he has
had some perfume.

256
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,445
Right? Well, that be Chanel No.

257
00:15:48,445 --> 00:15:49,346
Five or obsession.

258
00:15:51,248 --> 00:15:54,818
And speaking of obsession, it's time for
adventures with Bill.

259
00:15:56,286 --> 00:15:59,156
Bill brought a lot of gear here, he's going
to chop a tree.

260
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:00,257
I'll take that top bit.

261
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,658
I'll just put the action up.

262
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:08,198
Oh, not not that long ago, Bill, put it, put
it down in the act.

263
00:16:08,265 --> 00:16:10,500
This could pull it out of there and get that
out of their bill by hand.

264
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,870
It looks a bit loose down.

265
00:16:13,904 --> 00:16:17,541
Oh no, sorry, Bill's got all the gear there.

266
00:16:17,574 --> 00:16:19,309
These are called. I'm not sure what these
are.

267
00:16:22,546 --> 00:16:26,183
Oh, yeah, I know these are called horns,
their horns, they put them on and they dig

268
00:16:26,183 --> 00:16:31,254
into the tree. Bill got all this gear off
one of them telephone trucks parked outside a

269
00:16:31,254 --> 00:16:34,157
doughnut shop. That's some kind of a
protector or something.

270
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:35,292
I threw that away up here.

271
00:16:35,325 --> 00:16:38,595
Golly, I don't know what those protectors
are on there for.

272
00:16:38,595 --> 00:16:39,896
Anyway, nothing to protect.

273
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,699
Things go point down there, not point in
that area.

274
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:48,338
Anyway, he's all set up, and now he just
goes, Oh, I see what the protectors are for.

275
00:16:48,338 --> 00:16:49,506
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

276
00:16:49,873 --> 00:16:55,479
Otherwise, you pick up pieces of driftwood
and any small animals you might step on.

277
00:16:56,012 --> 00:17:00,717
Anyway, he's got the hard hat there, and now
I'm going to put this belt around the tree,

278
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:02,819
which I thought had to be snug before he
could get it.

279
00:17:04,988 --> 00:17:07,290
I've never done this kind of work before.

280
00:17:07,324 --> 00:17:09,259
You know, I was, I must admit, I was
guessing.

281
00:17:12,662 --> 00:17:14,798
All right, Alison, off. Now we got her, OK?

282
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:19,803
I see, I see you need a little bit, a little
bit of slack in there and then Poppy goes,

283
00:17:19,803 --> 00:17:24,841
dig down in and then the other and going, I
got to admit I was at this point, I was

284
00:17:24,841 --> 00:17:29,479
pretty impressed because Bill was getting up
the tree there, and a lot of times Bill tries

285
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:30,780
things and they just don't.

286
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,251
I don't know. I just don't seem to come
together just the way.

287
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:37,320
But this was this was really how well I met
him.

288
00:17:38,021 --> 00:17:40,590
I was speechless. And he's getting up there.

289
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,927
All done 50, 60, 62 feet.

290
00:17:44,594 --> 00:17:48,598
Way up there. And then the idea is he's
going to just cut the top right off the tree

291
00:17:48,598 --> 00:17:52,369
because I guess she was getting dangerous or
what have you.

292
00:17:52,402 --> 00:17:56,273
I don't know why they do it, actually, but
I, when it happened was lightning had already

293
00:17:56,506 --> 00:17:58,375
hit this tree and the top was completely
done.

294
00:17:59,509 --> 00:18:03,313
Bill hadn't noticed. I'm trying to get his
attention, but he's kind of wiping the bill.

295
00:18:03,313 --> 00:18:05,782
The tops missing up bill, all.

296
00:18:08,118 --> 00:18:14,457
Typekit. Oh, boy.

297
00:18:16,459 --> 00:18:19,029
Ooh! Lightning struck twice the same place.

298
00:18:20,163 --> 00:18:24,901
That he's OK, and he's inviting me to share
his joy.

299
00:18:34,878 --> 00:18:37,881
It shouldn't be a pretty quiet, large
meeting tonight with Glenn and helmet out

300
00:18:37,881 --> 00:18:41,351
painting the town plaid just seen them leave
it in the RV.

301
00:18:41,785 --> 00:18:45,422
Glenn had mapped spread all over the
windshield and helmet was folding the table

302
00:18:45,422 --> 00:18:46,423
down into a bed.

303
00:18:46,723 --> 00:18:49,893
Wow. That'd be a little insensitive thinking,
isn't it?

304
00:18:49,893 --> 00:18:53,596
I mean, I'd be a major turnoff for any woman
to walk right in there and see a bed there.

305
00:18:53,997 --> 00:18:56,699
Oh no, Harold, he's going to turn it back
into the table by the time they get there.

306
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,171
It's just a tux. That helmet rented was only
an extra extra, extra large and it's a tad

307
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:04,174
snug, so we can't get the pants on unless
he's lying down.

308
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,810
Learn why helmet had no trousers on.

309
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,813
When I saw him, I thought to myself, Well,
he's confident this thing.

310
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,748
Oh no, it's just a pants on.

311
00:19:11,748 --> 00:19:14,784
They're on. They're so darn tight on them,
Harold, that he's afraid that if he creases

312
00:19:14,784 --> 00:19:17,720
them, it'll create a weak spot and then the
pants will rupture and his whole body will

313
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,125
explode outwards. So once he got them on, is
going to open the sunroof so that helmet can

314
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,026
stand up for the trip.

315
00:19:25,094 --> 00:19:26,830
Oh, there's the cry of the wild possum uncle.

316
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,364
Read time for the lodge meeting better.

317
00:19:28,364 --> 00:19:28,898
Get down there.

318
00:19:29,532 --> 00:19:33,169
Yeah, this is probably won't take too long,
and the only business I know of is McGee is

319
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:34,270
going to try and sell us something.

320
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,371
So we're just going to let them talk for a
minute.

321
00:19:35,605 --> 00:19:36,940
Then we say no, and then that's the end of
it.

322
00:19:37,073 --> 00:19:37,941
So I'll be right back.

323
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:40,977
Great. Great. Great.

324
00:19:45,782 --> 00:19:49,118
Hey, hey, hey.

325
00:19:50,787 --> 00:19:51,721
All right.

326
00:19:53,189 --> 00:19:57,493
Above all, I will.

327
00:20:03,266 --> 00:20:05,501
On a quiet night tonight, boys.

328
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:08,471
Ok, the floor recognizes Murray Woolworth.

329
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:10,039
Yeah, OK.

330
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:14,177
Well, I just want everyone to know that
Thursday is going to be ladies night down at

331
00:20:14,177 --> 00:20:17,313
the store and the ladies can expect a 10
percent discount.

332
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,854
My life about that difference, this only
applies to single ladies.

333
00:20:26,723 --> 00:20:31,594
Good for me. Well, if that's all this is
tonight, then I'm going to call on.

334
00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:38,434
It goes back a little bit early, aren't you?

335
00:20:38,768 --> 00:20:40,603
Oh, so how'd it go?

336
00:20:40,636 --> 00:20:41,671
How'd it go? A double date.

337
00:20:41,704 --> 00:20:44,974
How did it go? You're on a double date
tonight with you, with each other and how to

338
00:20:44,974 --> 00:20:47,176
go the double date? Fine.

339
00:20:48,745 --> 00:20:50,146
Where's the tax?

340
00:20:50,213 --> 00:20:53,850
I broke it. That was the date.

341
00:20:53,883 --> 00:20:55,618
Double your pleasure. Double your fun, huh?

342
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:04,293
That's. Oh, did like did you actually look
like I look like Billy Joel from the nickel

343
00:21:04,293 --> 00:21:08,664
junction? No more like Billy the Kid from
Gunsmoke.

344
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,236
Did she have a nice personality?

345
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,273
Oh, wait a minute. Hold the phone, I just
thought of something.

346
00:21:18,074 --> 00:21:20,343
Leslie is a boy's name too, right?

347
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:21,477
Bingo.

348
00:21:30,887 --> 00:21:34,023
I just assumed that they were identical
twins, and they're not.

349
00:21:34,223 --> 00:21:35,424
Oh, okay.

350
00:21:35,825 --> 00:21:39,896
Leslie was just as disappointed, though,
because he thought that Glenn was a girl.

351
00:21:40,796 --> 00:21:45,034
Oh, really?

352
00:21:46,168 --> 00:21:48,371
Yeah, you know, like Glenn Close.

353
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:50,439
Wow, I was a real letdown.

354
00:21:52,508 --> 00:21:58,314
You know, Leslie actually thought Glenn was
a good looking girl and I thought I was

355
00:21:58,314 --> 00:22:01,817
desperate. He didn't believe you were a guy.

356
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:03,853
No, I shouldn't have shaved my whole body.

357
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,622
Oh, no. He asked for proof.

358
00:22:06,656 --> 00:22:09,525
So Glenn whipped out, is what you about?

359
00:22:09,725 --> 00:22:15,398
My driver's license? And Leslie said that a
driver's license could be faked.

360
00:22:15,431 --> 00:22:16,899
So then he grabbed.

361
00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:22,138
Well, forget the details, suffice to say, as
I punch the guy's lights out and we can't go

362
00:22:22,138 --> 00:22:24,040
back to that restaurant again, that's it.

363
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,940
End of story.

364
00:22:26,776 --> 00:22:29,512
Well, maybe, you know, even Leslie can still
be friends, though.

365
00:22:30,813 --> 00:22:31,881
No, no.

366
00:22:32,181 --> 00:22:33,416
That never works out, right?

367
00:22:35,684 --> 00:22:37,586
All right, well, that's it for large
business.

368
00:22:38,354 --> 00:22:39,622
I'm going to call on Bill here.

369
00:22:39,822 --> 00:22:40,956
Supply the evening's entertainment.

370
00:22:45,661 --> 00:22:47,630
This is a great one. Yeah, I love this script
I have.

371
00:22:49,632 --> 00:22:51,634
Okay. Nothing up his sleeve.

372
00:22:53,102 --> 00:22:57,540
Oh, well, there's a dream date they'll
remember for a while, or at least until they

373
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,108
work up the courage to go on another one.

374
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:02,244
It's amazing to me with so many eligible
bachelors up here.

375
00:23:02,244 --> 00:23:05,681
While they have so much trouble meeting
women, I think it's because the women have

376
00:23:05,681 --> 00:23:07,316
gotten smarter. It's too bad.

377
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:09,585
Anyway, my wife is watching.

378
00:23:09,585 --> 00:23:11,954
I'll be coming straight home after the
meeting and I'll be bringing a box of

379
00:23:11,954 --> 00:23:15,691
chocolates minus the chocolates because I
know you're on a diet and I should be,

380
00:23:16,192 --> 00:23:21,597
especially now. So until next time, on
behalf of myself and Harold and the whole

381
00:23:21,597 --> 00:23:22,998
gang up here at Possum Lodge.

382
00:23:23,232 --> 00:23:24,300
Keep your stick on the ice.

383
00:23:30,005 --> 00:23:31,273
Oh, oh my God.

384
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:41,050
Oh, God. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh

385
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:46,388
oh. So.
