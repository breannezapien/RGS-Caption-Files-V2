1
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:44,911
It's a world going by too fast is your life
seemed like a bad movie and the VCR stuck on

2
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:47,413
fast forward it's flashing 12.

3
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:51,818
Well, well, well, well, it's time to put
your life on pause.

4
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:55,388
Readjust your SKU, reset your counter, clean
your heads.

5
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,357
It's the red green show.

6
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,961
And here's the man whose life really is a TV
show on the unmarked tape of reality.

7
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:05,164
Here he is my uncle and the man they call
red green.

8
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:06,599
Well, what's his name?

9
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,301
Here he is. Red green.

10
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:13,840
Thank you and welcome to Possum Lodge.

11
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,510
Despite actually what my nephew Harold here
says, I'm not so much of the star of the show

12
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,479
as I am the ringmaster of the circus.

13
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:21,180
So let's bring in the clowns.

14
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:22,682
Harold say hello. Ok.

15
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:28,321
Hello. I'm Harold Greene and I'm the director
producer of the show, and I do things like

16
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:35,161
this. Oh, it gives that show that, you know,
professional and slick look.

17
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,030
Yeah, a lot like his haircut.

18
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,700
And we all have different areas of expertise
up here at the Lodge.

19
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,371
And as ringmaster, my job is to understand
the workings of the human mind and see if

20
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:50,143
that in any way relates to any of the large
members that we all have all these different

21
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,278
interests. And yet, you know, we do share
certain things.

22
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:56,449
We share a love of sports and the outdoors
and beer and good talk and women.

23
00:01:56,916 --> 00:02:00,053
Although I think if most of the members
could could find a woman, they probably drop

24
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:00,853
everything else.

25
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:04,857
Well, actually, I'm glad you're married and
you still like sports beer in the outdoors.

26
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:09,595
Yeah, but I just do that to keep my marriage
fresh air anyway.

27
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,498
Everybody has all these different interests
and nobody judges anybody.

28
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:16,903
So so you don't get judged yourself, you
know, let he, who is without stupidity, cast

29
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:20,506
the first insult. And sometimes the guys
will actually combine a couple other

30
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:25,611
interests like, say, beer and the outdoors
or beer and sports or beer and talk.

31
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:33,719
Oh, what was that?

32
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,322
Well, that's that's another combo out there.

33
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:40,927
You see, Bob drives a golf balls out and
then helmet blasts him out of the air with a

34
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,162
shotgun shell. It's called skeet golf.

35
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:46,599
Well, how come nobody like combines your
interests with mine?

36
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,467
You know, I feel sort of left out.

37
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:49,468
I have interest, too.

38
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:51,771
Well, why don't we do that right now, Harold?

39
00:02:52,104 --> 00:02:55,408
You take us into the next segment with that
gizmo of yours, which is one of your

40
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:58,477
interests. And then I can go back to
ignoring you, which is one of mine.

41
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:02,848
Oh, OK, great. Was that an insult?

42
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:12,658
Not if you have to ask. Oh,

43
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:15,127
not sorry, Bill. Now you took too much off
that leg.

44
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,162
You got to take some more off the other
side.

45
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:24,570
Bell, Bell, Bell, Bell.

46
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:28,407
Can you take it outside? Thank you.

47
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:38,751
I've been shopping Hook Line got some stuff
for the RV here.

48
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:42,588
Air fresheners. When it comes to RV here.

49
00:03:42,588 --> 00:03:44,056
But what's that phrase? What's that for?

50
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,025
It starts with a aficionado.

51
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,960
No anal retentive.

52
00:03:47,993 --> 00:03:48,527
That's that.

53
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:55,868
What the hell is going on out there?

54
00:03:56,702 --> 00:04:00,639
Oh, bob and helmet, they're playing skeet
golf, skeet golf now.

55
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:03,075
Well, like Bob can't get anybody to play golf
with him, right?

56
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:05,177
And Helmet can't find anybody to go hunting
with them.

57
00:04:05,177 --> 00:04:07,012
So what they do is Bob hits

58
00:04:07,012 --> 00:04:09,448
The ball and then helmet blasts them into
little pieces.

59
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:10,850
When they land, they don't hit people.

60
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,551
Oh oh.

61
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,860
Oh, my God.

62
00:04:21,994 --> 00:04:23,929
That was Glass breaking my RV.

63
00:04:24,363 --> 00:04:28,334
They've wrecked my army. No, no, no, no, I'm
pretty sure no way because they hit a boat

64
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,468
towards the lake. You're OK.

65
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:32,271
Really? Oh, all right.

66
00:04:32,638 --> 00:04:33,939
I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll pretend
it.

67
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:39,578
Oh, hi, Glenn, how are you doing today?

68
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:43,148
Good to see you. You guys wrecked my our
Virginia Glen Glen.

69
00:04:43,215 --> 00:04:45,050
Don't be silly. No, of course not.

70
00:04:46,218 --> 00:04:48,053
You're being nice to me. You did.

71
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:57,630
You wrecked. Where a gold helmets me,
they're supposed to blast the ball before it

72
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,766
hits the ground. You hit it backwards, bob.

73
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,968
The ball actually went backwards.

74
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,338
I don't mind shooting them when you're
hooking them and slicing them in front of me,

75
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:07,840
but I don't have eyes in the back of my
head.

76
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,142
You don't have anything in the back of your
head.

77
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,247
Know I listen to him.

78
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:18,150
What's with him in that mobile home, anyway?

79
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,418
You know what he is?

80
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:22,588
Well, I don't want to say in front of Harold,
but it starts with an

81
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,089
A. Anal retentive.

82
00:05:24,556 --> 00:05:26,091
No, but you're close.

83
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,526
I got to get some more jokes.

84
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:32,831
He's been golfing again there, Bob.

85
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:34,466
Oh yes, sir ed.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,471
It's great fun. You know, seeing little bits
of dimpled ball rain down over the lake.

87
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,677
You wrecked it. You repair me.

88
00:05:45,811 --> 00:05:48,180
Destroy destroyed. Is it all smashed up?

89
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,815
Little pieces and everything? Yes.

90
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:51,950
I got to see this.

91
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:54,787
Me right?

92
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,089
They smashed my sunroof.

93
00:05:57,923 --> 00:06:00,092
You guys will pay for it. You guys will
replace it.

94
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:01,460
Not me. I didn't wreck it.

95
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,928
You animals wrecked it.

96
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:04,029
All right. All right.

97
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:05,230
Glenn will replace it.

98
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,298
Same make. Same model.

99
00:06:06,298 --> 00:06:07,766
Same everything. Fine.

100
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:12,070
It's a twenty four foot sea breeze coastline
or two thousand.

101
00:06:12,404 --> 00:06:17,309
I got the optional V8 engine and I got the
plush interior of a sunroof.

102
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:17,876
Is that?

103
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,479
I think he's talking about the whole RV bob.

104
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:22,414
Yes. You wrecked it.

105
00:06:22,414 --> 00:06:25,184
You replace it. Look, I'll replace the
sunroof.

106
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,386
The rest of it was your mistake.

107
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,390
You'll get me a new RV, mister.

108
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,091
I don't think so.

109
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,493
Why don't you go talk to helmet?

110
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:35,494
Get him to replace it?

111
00:06:35,494 --> 00:06:37,162
That's it. Go yell at helmet.

112
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:38,530
Oh yeah, you'd love that.

113
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,965
Wouldn't you seeing me dead?

114
00:06:40,432 --> 00:06:46,805
You just get me a new RV, but you don't
remember this, but I'm the natural resource

115
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:47,839
rep in this area.

116
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:50,742
Well, I could close down that marina of
yours.

117
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,512
That's just a big, toxic dump with boats
stuck to it.

118
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:57,215
Fine, Bob, just get me a new RV red.

119
00:06:57,249 --> 00:07:01,386
I want these guys suspended from the lodge
until they buy me a substitute home.

120
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:04,790
You guys have to bring that up at the meeting
tonight.

121
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:07,125
I got I got some things to do.

122
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,761
Bring your checkbook, pal.

123
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:11,730
Well, you too, pal.

124
00:07:12,164 --> 00:07:13,932
You know, go down to that black hole.

125
00:07:13,932 --> 00:07:16,168
You call home arena for a quick inspection.

126
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:19,304
You probably come up with about, oh, I don't
know, five thousand dollars worth of

127
00:07:19,304 --> 00:07:20,639
environmental infractions.

128
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:21,873
Just at the gas pump.

129
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:23,742
You owe me a new RV.

130
00:07:24,676 --> 00:07:24,710
Bob.

131
00:07:30,782 --> 00:07:36,922
Plan to load up and laden to the right, stop
on your belly and shut your eyes, hop on your

132
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:38,690
haunches, jump in the air.

133
00:07:38,757 --> 00:07:41,193
It looks to me like that meal was a little
too spicy.

134
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:55,574
This week on Handymen Corner, when I show
you something you can do with an old fridge

135
00:07:55,574 --> 00:07:57,509
that's lost what it takes to keep your
butter hard.

136
00:07:58,276 --> 00:08:01,046
You know, an old an old fridge like this
sounds like something you'd have to pay a

137
00:08:01,046 --> 00:08:04,583
scrap dealer to haul this thing away, but
we're going to turn it into something that no

138
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,718
junk dealer would touch a gentleman's
armoire.

139
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:13,091
All right. First thing we got to do is we
got to disconnect the refrigeration unit here

140
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:13,959
And

141
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,000
Now we'll just pry all this stuff off the
back.

142
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,535
And we have a little problem here.

143
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:25,570
There's a gas and this is called Freon.

144
00:08:25,604 --> 00:08:27,172
Now this is a gas that has no smell.

145
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:28,840
We don't see a lot of that up at the Lodge.

146
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:33,545
But the problem with it is that once this
stuff cuts loose, it goes up way up into the

147
00:08:33,545 --> 00:08:35,881
atmosphere and takes out the ONOE layer or
something like that.

148
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:40,552
So we've got to be very careful and try and
capture all the gas as soon as it escapes,

149
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:43,154
because it would just, first of all, break
the seal.

150
00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:46,791
All right, but very, very quickly.

151
00:08:53,698 --> 00:08:56,868
You know, if everybody did that and the
Earth would be a heck of a lot better place

152
00:08:56,868 --> 00:09:02,974
to live, I think that now we're just going
to gently remove the pump unit on the bottom

153
00:09:02,974 --> 00:09:08,613
there already.

154
00:09:14,953 --> 00:09:16,087
My gosh, usually I'm here.

155
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:19,991
So now we got her.

156
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:25,196
And what do we have to do to turn into a
gentleman's armoire diddly squat?

157
00:09:27,465 --> 00:09:28,967
You got your ties in the door there.

158
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,136
You've got a shelf for your shirts, you've
got a shelf for your pants.

159
00:09:31,136 --> 00:09:33,505
You've got a shelf for other things you
don't like to describe in public.

160
00:09:34,038 --> 00:09:35,874
You keep your underwear and keep her over
here.

161
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:38,977
Keep your socks in the vegetable crisper.

162
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:40,678
You might want to throw a box of baking soda
in there.

163
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:44,816
You got all your clothes handy and just
right, ready for you to use and look what we

164
00:09:44,816 --> 00:09:51,823
got up here in the freezer. Your very own
haberdashery, Al Harrill says teenagers like

165
00:09:51,823 --> 00:09:55,760
to wear cool clothes, well, how much cooler
can you be than have your clothes in the

166
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,330
fridge? Personally, I'd rather give my
clothes the Sally-Ann.

167
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:02,200
Throw Harold in the fridge. Actually, I
didn't.

168
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:03,868
I didn't want to show you something else to
do the fridge.

169
00:10:03,868 --> 00:10:07,505
You can turn a fridge actually into a into a
fishing boat, but we are a little short of

170
00:10:07,505 --> 00:10:11,009
time. So I'm just going to say, remember, if
the women don't find you handsome, they

171
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:12,610
should at least find your handy.

172
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:16,915
If you want to do the fishing boat thing,
you just knock off both doors flipped over on

173
00:10:16,915 --> 00:10:18,483
its back with a 20 horse on the back.

174
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,518
Throw your bait into the meat keeper and
you're gone.

175
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:24,956
Oh, Bill, wow, great.

176
00:10:25,023 --> 00:10:30,528
Think you got it? Three, At least you don't
want a Japanese restaurant.

177
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:48,346
It is spring. The days are growing longer,
the nights are growing shorter.

178
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,848
Some of us think there may be a connection.

179
00:10:56,788 --> 00:11:00,391
Well, Glen Braxton is still on the warpath
about his RV sunroof.

180
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:04,095
Glen blames Bob because Bob's 90 pounds
lighter than helmet.

181
00:11:04,962 --> 00:11:07,131
Also, golf clubs don't hurt as much as guns.

182
00:11:07,865 --> 00:11:11,636
Bob Miller and he blames he blames helmet
but not to his face, of course, and helmet

183
00:11:11,636 --> 00:11:14,439
could care less, which is a pretty popular
attitude up here at the Lodge.

184
00:11:14,972 --> 00:11:17,241
But I'll tell you, Bob has really got his
dander up.

185
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:22,280
You can use my special shampoo if he wants
smells like rotten eggs, you know, but it

186
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,014
really works.

187
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:25,183
All right, so he got his dander up.

188
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:26,851
It means he got angry.

189
00:11:27,652 --> 00:11:28,953
What's what's a dander?

190
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,888
Is it like a body part? I never heard it.

191
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:34,192
I don't know what it is here. It's just
something that goes up when you get angry.

192
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:34,759
That's all.

193
00:11:35,193 --> 00:11:37,395
Well, if you don't know what it is, how do
you know if it's up or down?

194
00:11:37,762 --> 00:11:39,263
Don't worry, Harold. You'll know.

195
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:45,436
Anyway, Bob is notified, Glenn, that the
marina is a class nine environmental hazard

196
00:11:45,436 --> 00:11:46,671
and a Class 10 eyesore.

197
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:48,439
He went down there taking samples.

198
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:50,408
You got air samples, water samples, soil
samples.

199
00:11:50,808 --> 00:11:51,809
He's ended up impounded.

200
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:56,848
The whole marina, including Glenn's RV that
was parked inside Glen got so darn mad he

201
00:11:56,848 --> 00:11:58,216
attacked Bob with a boat trailer.

202
00:11:58,749 --> 00:12:01,519
It's this whole situation getting out of
control and or what?

203
00:12:01,752 --> 00:12:04,822
I hate to see a good friendship break up
because the money, you know, that's why I

204
00:12:04,822 --> 00:12:05,990
never asked for a raise.

205
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,093
Yeah. Well, this is a pride thing, Harold.

206
00:12:09,093 --> 00:12:11,195
You know, neither one of these guys wants to
look like a loser.

207
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:13,064
Is a challenge now.

208
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:14,332
It's a question of honor, OK?

209
00:12:14,665 --> 00:12:16,000
Nobody wants to back down.

210
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:19,704
Oh, so they're fighting like two roosters
over a hen.

211
00:12:20,004 --> 00:12:21,038
Exactly right, Harold?

212
00:12:21,105 --> 00:12:24,909
Oh, I knew this whole thing was about S-E-X.

213
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:30,348
Two Roosters. I'll bet you that's what the
dander is.

214
00:12:30,381 --> 00:12:31,816
I'll bet you. Yeah, I bet you that.

215
00:12:31,849 --> 00:12:34,452
Like that red, fleshy thing that hangs from
roosters neck like that.

216
00:12:34,785 --> 00:12:37,388
That's a dander. Figured it out, dander.

217
00:12:43,527 --> 00:12:44,929
Oh no, you're down here.

218
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:46,430
Yeah. Grease in my umbrella flat.

219
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:48,632
Oh, sure. Envy you single guys.

220
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,270
I don't know how this this stupid son of
argument is a long way out of proportion.

221
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:55,139
Bob and Glenn are acting like kids.

222
00:12:55,806 --> 00:12:57,308
Oh, that's terrible.

223
00:12:57,775 --> 00:12:58,943
What would their mom say?

224
00:12:59,143 --> 00:13:00,144
I know what my mom would say.

225
00:13:00,144 --> 00:13:05,416
I should say, you act civilized or else
whack my mom's especially well.

226
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,784
She must be how much you let you live at
home.

227
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:08,619
Well, I help with the rent.

228
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:11,555
You know, the landlord comes over and I
scare him off.

229
00:13:12,857 --> 00:13:14,458
His life hasn't been easy for my mom.

230
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:18,896
You know, first I was a difficult birth, and
that's not easy on a 16 year old girl.

231
00:13:19,263 --> 00:13:23,367
And then my father will, you know, he left
home when I was six?

232
00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:25,436
Oh my gosh, where do you go,

233
00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:28,939
The beer store? First time I saw him get off
the couch, ever.

234
00:13:29,573 --> 00:13:33,844
You know, when my mom had to do everything
herself cleaning the place, order the pizzas

235
00:13:33,878 --> 00:13:35,212
because she held down two jobs.

236
00:13:35,212 --> 00:13:38,916
She was a wax jockey at the car wash and a
human cannonball in the circus.

237
00:13:39,116 --> 00:13:41,051
I mean, she taught herself karate.

238
00:13:41,118 --> 00:13:42,219
This woman is a saint.

239
00:13:43,053 --> 00:13:45,322
Well, it sounds like she was canonized by the
Ringling brothers.

240
00:13:46,624 --> 00:13:48,025
And speaking of projectiles helmet.

241
00:13:48,192 --> 00:13:49,426
What about this sunroof thing?

242
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,964
Well, I guess I could have a look at it, but
first I got to get the pump running and then

243
00:13:53,964 --> 00:13:56,133
I said I clean out the eavesdrops on stinky
struck.

244
00:13:57,234 --> 00:13:58,402
Well, I just appreciate it.

245
00:13:58,502 --> 00:13:59,570
Take a look. I mean, you know what?

246
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,671
I think your mother would appreciate it,
too.

247
00:14:01,505 --> 00:14:02,306
Yeah, really?

248
00:14:02,606 --> 00:14:03,641
Oh yeah, I think so. Yeah.

249
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:06,310
Well, I'll do it right now then for mom,
right?

250
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:09,713
Oh, I better take some tools

251
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,886
Belt on me now. I mean, I'm out in the woods,
but I didn't.

252
00:14:15,886 --> 00:14:18,422
I couldn't find Well. Oh gosh sakes, huh?

253
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:20,224
I guess Bill, it moved.

254
00:14:25,296 --> 00:14:28,799
Anyway, what Bill wanted to show us here was
if you're out in the woods and you get

255
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,135
hungry, you don't have to have brought your
lunch or anything.

256
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:34,271
There's there's food available right from
the various plants and trees.

257
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:37,808
Now this one here, for example, some type of
a nut.

258
00:14:37,808 --> 00:14:39,343
It's a hard little nut.

259
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:41,445
Might be a type of a walnut or something to
shake the tree.

260
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:43,147
I thought maybe a kick might help if I
could.

261
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:43,681
And.

262
00:14:44,248 --> 00:14:45,849
Yeah. Yeah, that worked out well.

263
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:51,355
Funny how the dots were, just all come down
on the one side, but I would say the nuts are

264
00:14:51,355 --> 00:14:53,891
attracted to Bill anyway.

265
00:14:53,891 --> 00:14:56,727
You gather them up and put them into your
interior.

266
00:14:58,362 --> 00:15:01,298
Yeah, it's kind of fun, too. I wasn't as
hungry as Bill.

267
00:15:02,099 --> 00:15:05,436
Now he's got to break the nuts open, so he's
using the knife, trying to cut through.

268
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:07,538
But a shell on me is quite light your
fingers.

269
00:15:08,305 --> 00:15:10,607
So he does this the back of the head then.

270
00:15:10,774 --> 00:15:13,811
And then, of course, he wants me to hold it
and watch it carefully now.

271
00:15:13,844 --> 00:15:15,045
Here we go. Watch this While here we go.

272
00:15:15,245 --> 00:15:15,979
Pop up at.

273
00:15:18,382 --> 00:15:20,317
Oh, oh, by golly.

274
00:15:22,219 --> 00:15:27,624
Oh, smoking. Oh, he's he's OK now, he's left
to the van to get a bandage on that, and I

275
00:15:27,624 --> 00:15:29,126
could actually work quite well.

276
00:15:29,193 --> 00:15:31,228
I don't know. He just took too much of a
back swing on that one.

277
00:15:31,628 --> 00:15:33,063
And in days, too bad, either.

278
00:15:33,864 --> 00:15:37,267
Now he's heading to the old, safer approach
using a hammer on this, which I think was a

279
00:15:37,267 --> 00:15:37,968
little too much.

280
00:15:38,168 --> 00:15:38,569
Oh.

281
00:15:40,437 --> 00:15:45,242
You know what I mean, the food value is still
there, even even though they're not just

282
00:15:45,242 --> 00:15:46,009
crushed a little

283
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,278
This and that's not

284
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:57,421
An attractive way to eat unless you know this
is this is an interesting wild berry that

285
00:15:57,421 --> 00:15:58,989
grows at around around the lodge.

286
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:03,393
And there's two kinds of this one is very
sweet and delicious, and the other is very

287
00:16:03,393 --> 00:16:05,729
sour, and I think we'll kill you.

288
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,531
And they looked identical.

289
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:10,767
So I think it's mainly the weight.

290
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:12,970
And now we got the wrong. Once we got the
wrong ones there, bill.

291
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:14,738
These are these are built long lines.

292
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:19,309
And of course, now the frustration in this
happened with men sometimes and just.

293
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:22,245
Thankfully, I'm not proud of that.

294
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:25,949
Now this was trying to use some smoke to get
the bees out of the beehive so that we can

295
00:16:25,949 --> 00:16:27,384
get the honey, I never knew this before.

296
00:16:27,484 --> 00:16:33,090
Apparently the smoke, but I think you should
be a little more attention to where the bill.

297
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:38,729
Well, I guess it's toasted, honey.

298
00:16:40,897 --> 00:16:46,103
Yeah, bill, I'll take care of it. Harold,
have you given any thought to having children

299
00:16:46,103 --> 00:16:47,170
any time, every night?

300
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,205
I think about it. No, no.

301
00:16:48,205 --> 00:16:49,272
I mean, having children.

302
00:16:49,306 --> 00:16:51,808
Oh, well, yeah, I'd like to have children one
day.

303
00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:53,176
Yeah, yeah. I think it'd be great.

304
00:16:53,176 --> 00:16:54,511
I'd like to have a child myself.

305
00:16:55,078 --> 00:16:56,880
No, no. You can't have a child.

306
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:57,547
Yes, I

307
00:16:57,547 --> 00:16:59,182
Could do that with modern science.

308
00:16:59,182 --> 00:16:59,916
I wish I could.

309
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:01,952
You can have a child like a child.

310
00:17:02,018 --> 00:17:02,252
Yes.

311
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,187
Yes, I could be the first pregnant man.

312
00:17:05,388 --> 00:17:09,059
I couldn't stand behind myself and support
me during the birth.

313
00:17:10,827 --> 00:17:12,028
And you would you like to have children?

314
00:17:12,362 --> 00:17:15,966
I'm not that way. I don't think there's a
breathing exercise in the world if it gets

315
00:17:15,966 --> 00:17:17,367
any easier a delivery. You know what I mean?

316
00:17:18,568 --> 00:17:19,769
It'd be fun to watch you, though.

317
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,004
You make me laugh.

318
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,076
Oh, that's important. I.

319
00:17:34,518 --> 00:17:37,721
Well, I hate to agree with Harold on
anything, you know, but this situation

320
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:40,190
between Bob and Glen actually has gotten out
of hand.

321
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:44,895
You know, after Bob impounded Glenn's marina
with his RV trapped inside, Glen went over

322
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:49,900
and broke into Bob's office, which is his
locker, the golf course, and he stole Bob's

323
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,567
IUD.

324
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:53,370
Uncle Fred, I think you mean ID.

325
00:17:54,471 --> 00:17:55,505
Oh yeah.

326
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:56,706
Oh yeah, I hope so. Yeah.

327
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,774
Well, maybe it was.

328
00:17:57,774 --> 00:17:59,709
Maybe it was his ID with an IOU in it.

329
00:18:01,311 --> 00:18:06,416
Anyway, he took his wallet and and Glenn
went down to to an RV dealership, and he used

330
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:10,320
the ID to buy himself a brand new 30 foot
mobile home.

331
00:18:10,353 --> 00:18:11,821
Yeah, that does sound like ID.

332
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:14,024
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

333
00:18:14,057 --> 00:18:19,462
Yeah. Anyway, Glen drove out of there was it
was his big RV that it was bought by Bob

334
00:18:19,462 --> 00:18:20,964
Stuyvesant without him knowing the car.

335
00:18:20,964 --> 00:18:25,669
So now Bob's account is about fifty thousand
overdrawn, which is going to be tough for him

336
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:28,405
to handle, even though you know he doesn't
make a good living, working part time for the

337
00:18:28,405 --> 00:18:28,972
government.

338
00:18:29,305 --> 00:18:30,740
I thought he worked full time.

339
00:18:31,341 --> 00:18:34,511
No, no, no. He's paid full time, but he but
he works part time.

340
00:18:34,878 --> 00:18:37,647
The rest of the time, he golfs anyway.

341
00:18:37,747 --> 00:18:41,551
By the time the bad check with the fake
signature went buoying the RV, people called

342
00:18:41,551 --> 00:18:45,288
the cops and they came over and arrested Bob
and Glenn took them down to the courthouse.

343
00:18:45,288 --> 00:18:48,425
Wow. Oh man! Sedgwick decided to go down and
try to put up bail for them, and stinky

344
00:18:48,425 --> 00:18:51,261
Peterson said he'd go along as a character
witness, but luckily they didn't get to

345
00:18:51,261 --> 00:18:55,298
testify. By the time they got there, the
judge said that he was going to drop all the

346
00:18:55,298 --> 00:18:58,334
charges against Bob and Glenn as long as
they could settle the thing themselves out of

347
00:18:58,334 --> 00:19:01,604
court. So it's the top item of business at
tonight's Lodge meeting.

348
00:19:01,871 --> 00:19:04,107
Why this pride thing really is dangerous,
isn't it?

349
00:19:04,607 --> 00:19:06,075
Sure. Is, Harold, you won't catch me doing
it.

350
00:19:06,643 --> 00:19:09,846
Pride comes before a something something
bad.

351
00:19:11,147 --> 00:19:13,550
Well, by the way, I try to look up dander in
the dictionary.

352
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,818
Oh yeah. What did you find?

353
00:19:14,818 --> 00:19:16,519
I found we could use a dictionary up here.

354
00:19:18,354 --> 00:19:20,089
Oh, oh, that's if they called on the
meeting.

355
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,691
Well, this is going to be great.

356
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:24,494
The wild possum. Scream Uncle Ray, let's get
downstairs.

357
00:19:25,161 --> 00:19:26,596
Oh, this is going to be so cool.

358
00:19:26,629 --> 00:19:27,664
He was in jail.

359
00:19:28,398 --> 00:19:29,599
I wonder if we saw Uncle Raleigh.

360
00:19:31,467 --> 00:19:36,673
Wow. It's amazing how much intrigue and drama
and excitement we can get out of a $30 plexi

361
00:19:36,739 --> 00:19:38,541
glass sunroof, isn't it? Could be worse,
though.

362
00:19:39,042 --> 00:19:40,376
We could be at home watching this on
television.

363
00:19:41,978 --> 00:19:43,112
Sorry, that came out wrong.

364
00:19:44,514 --> 00:19:51,721
Ray Ray, Ray Ray

365
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:56,759
Rice.

366
00:20:01,464 --> 00:20:09,305
One. And now how I see her how to sing, sing
the

367
00:20:11,274 --> 00:20:12,875
floor, recognizes Bob Stuyvesant.

368
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,880
Thank you. I can't believe what happened.

369
00:20:18,748 --> 00:20:23,186
Let me me, a government official in jail,
and I'm not even a politician.

370
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:29,525
It's horrible when the cells are just so
small, there's no room to practice putting.

371
00:20:30,293 --> 00:20:31,427
I would die in prison.

372
00:20:31,427 --> 00:20:35,932
I would just die. Prison was fine for me, so
it's just like living in the RV.

373
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,237
Now, as I understand it, the judge has told
these two guys they got a settlement of some

374
00:20:41,237 --> 00:20:42,271
kind. Is that right? Yes.

375
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,074
Well, I got no idea.

376
00:20:45,808 --> 00:20:48,511
Glenn, you don't actually need a new RV.

377
00:20:49,078 --> 00:20:52,949
You might get a lemon or you could get one
with a big scratch, and they come with big

378
00:20:52,949 --> 00:20:53,616
scratches now.

379
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:55,218
I heard that. Oh, that's true.

380
00:20:55,251 --> 00:20:55,518
Yeah.

381
00:20:57,053 --> 00:21:00,256
And Bob here? Well, it's not his fault that
the sunroof got smashed.

382
00:21:00,623 --> 00:21:02,058
You know, he got a rogue ball.

383
00:21:03,493 --> 00:21:06,195
So, Bob, why don't you just make good on the
sunroof?

384
00:21:07,096 --> 00:21:09,499
And then everybody would be happy and
nobody's compromised?

385
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:11,968
Well, I can live with that.

386
00:21:12,201 --> 00:21:13,069
That's fine for me.

387
00:21:14,036 --> 00:21:17,340
Well, great. And all we got to do now is get
Bob to lift the injunction on the marina and

388
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,541
Glen here can open up again.

389
00:21:18,774 --> 00:21:20,176
Well, there's no rush on that red.

390
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:24,480
I want to get the RV. Oh, sure, no problem.

391
00:21:24,914 --> 00:21:26,015
Yeah, I want to take her for a run, you
know?

392
00:21:26,215 --> 00:21:27,783
I mean, she's been sitting around for a day.

393
00:21:30,386 --> 00:21:32,488
Maybe I could take you out to the driving
range tomorrow, Bob.

394
00:21:33,623 --> 00:21:36,826
Well, that would be great. I could drive on
a bucket of balls.

395
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:38,427
I could drive over a bucket of all.

396
00:21:40,863 --> 00:21:42,131
I could do that.

397
00:21:42,498 --> 00:21:44,100
You know, Bob, it wasn't really your fault,
though.

398
00:21:44,267 --> 00:21:46,469
I mean, that helmet, that moron.

399
00:21:46,535 --> 00:21:48,137
He couldn't hit the broadside of a barn.

400
00:21:49,138 --> 00:21:51,007
He is a broadside of a barn.

401
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:55,911
Yeah. You don't want my mistake was a
standing downwind of him.

402
00:21:57,013 --> 00:21:58,414
He's not going to shoot his own head up.

403
00:21:58,748 --> 00:22:01,417
No. Well, it wouldn't make any difference if
you know what I mean.

404
00:22:02,852 --> 00:22:08,924
Guys talking about me or not me, bob.

405
00:22:12,061 --> 00:22:15,598
Well, I couldn't fix the sunroof when you're
RV, but I found a golf ball.

406
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:18,367
Oh, that's great.

407
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:20,436
Well, that's my lucky ball.

408
00:22:20,436 --> 00:22:21,470
Yeah, good.

409
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:36,419
Hey, Foster took a little step outside, I
love to remember her,

410
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,387
oh,

411
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:44,860
That's taken care of. I call on Bob here to
supply the evening's entertainment.

412
00:22:45,995 --> 00:22:48,330
All right. We'll take a rest.

413
00:22:49,365 --> 00:22:55,671
Well, my fellow brothers, there's this just
rabbi, that's priests in this ministry.

414
00:22:56,005 --> 00:22:59,441
Well, I guess Bob and Glenn have to be pretty
satisfied with the way that turned out.

415
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:03,913
They got to keep their pride and their
teeth, and they managed to stay go to jail,

416
00:23:03,913 --> 00:23:06,315
which to me is always worth a little extra
time and effort.

417
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:08,551
Anyway, my wife is watching.

418
00:23:08,584 --> 00:23:11,620
I'll be coming straight home after the
meeting and I'm kind of in the mood for a

419
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:17,293
little two handed yoga or feeling that maybe
we can play some cards until next time.

420
00:23:17,326 --> 00:23:20,196
I'll be out for myself and Harold and the
whole gang up here.

421
00:23:20,229 --> 00:23:22,331
Possum Lodge. Keep your stick on the ice.

422
00:23:28,103 --> 00:23:29,505
Anyway, anyway, although the

423
00:23:29,505 --> 00:23:31,073
Rabbi decides eventually that he's going to
use

424
00:23:31,674 --> 00:23:36,879
The five five five all oh no, the four iron,
