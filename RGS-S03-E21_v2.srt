>>RED: THANK YOU VERY MUCH

21
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:02,962
AND THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING

22
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:04,397
MY BEARD THERE HAROLD,

23
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,365
I TAKE IT THAT WAS JUST

24
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:07,166
JEALOUSY ON YOUR PART.

25
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:10,003
>>HAROLD: NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,

26
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:10,937
THE BEARD'S YOUR THING

27
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:12,105
I DON'T WANT ANY PART OF IT,

28
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:18,711
THIS IS MY THING.

29
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:19,779
>>RED: WELL I THINK

30
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:21,848
THAT MAKES US EVEN.

31
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:23,683
ANYWAY WE HAD A BIT OF

32
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:24,317
EXCITEMENT UP AT THE LODGE

33
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:25,251
THIS WEEK, MOOSE THOMPSON

34
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,085
DECIDED HE WANTED

35
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:27,086
TO GO WATERSKIING,

36
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:28,154
THE ONLY PROBLEM BEING WE

37
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,055
DON'T REALLY HAVE A BOAT

38
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:30,290
POWERFUL ENOUGH TO GET MOOSE UP.

39
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,726
>>HAROLD: NEITHER DOES THE NAVY,

40
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:36,062
MOOSE IS BIGGER THAN AN OX.

41
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:37,930
>>RED: WELL PHYSICALLY YES,

42
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,167
MENTALLY IT'S TOO CLOSE TO CALL.

43
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:42,235
SO MOOSE FIGURED HE GOT TO FIND

44
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,903
ANOTHER WAY TO GO WATERSKIING,

45
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:44,771
SO HE DECIDED HE'D GO OUT

46
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,672
AND FIND A LAKE WITH

47
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:51,811
A HILL IN IT.

48
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,680
>>HAROLD: UNCLE RED,

49
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,814
EXCUSE ME BUT I DON'T THINK

50
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:55,682
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND A LAKE

51
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:56,482
WITH A HILL IN IT,

52
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:58,518
THERE'S NO SUCH THING.

53
00:01:58,518 --> 00:01:59,285
>>RED: WELL WHAT IS

54
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:05,391
A WATERFALL HAROLD?

55
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:08,461
SO MOOSE WENT WATERSKIING

56
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,397
OVER ROCKY REEF FALLS.

57
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:12,632
>>HAROLD: OH THAT'S

58
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,933
AN EXCELLENT CHOICE

59
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:14,734
ROCKY REEF FALLS,

60
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:15,601
EXCELLENT CHOICE BECAUSE PEOPLE

61
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:16,436
SAY YOU KNOW THAT WHERE THE

62
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:17,437
WATER FALLS INTO THAT POND,

63
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,038
THEY SAY IT BOTTOMLESS SO.

64
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:19,906
>>RED: WELL ACCORDING TO MOOSE

65
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,609
THOSE REPORTS ARE EXAGGERATED,

66
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:25,344
IN FACT THE COLLISION ALMOST

67
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:29,882
MADE MOOSE BOTTOMLESS.

68
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:31,050
BUT WHEN HE REGAINED

69
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,286
CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE RECOVERY

70
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,420
ROOM HE SAW SOME OF THAT

71
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,488
SURGICAL TUBING HANGING ON

72
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,589
THE WALL THERE AND THAT

73
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,391
GAVE HIM AN IDEA.

74
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:39,325
>>HAROLD: 2 IDEAS IN ONE DAY,

75
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,259
THAT DON'T SOUND LIKE MOOSE

76
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:42,161
TO ME.

77
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:43,763
>>RED: WELL I BLAME

78
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:44,664
THE CONCUSSION.

79
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,132
SO WHAT HE DID WAS HE MANAGED

80
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,667
TO STEAL ABOUT 100 FEET

81
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,935
OF THAT TUBING AND HE HID

82
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:52,905
IT IN HIS BELLY BUTTON,

83
00:02:52,905 --> 00:02:56,209

'HANDYMAN CORNER' WE'RE

95
00:03:26,138 --> 00:03:27,073
GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW YOU

96
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,140
COULD USE ONE TYPE OF

97
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,308
TRANSPORTATION TO TRANSPORT

98
00:03:29,308 --> 00:03:31,410
ANOTHER TYPE OF TRANSPORTATION

99
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,645
WITHOUT ACTUALLY TRANSPOSING

100
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:35,948
THE ONE TRANS.

101
00:03:35,948 --> 00:03:37,016
ALL RIGHT WHAT I'M TALKING

102
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:37,983
ABOUT HERE IS MOVING YOUR

103
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:39,018
BOAT YOU KNOW LIKE A TRAILER

104
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:39,985
TYPE OF THING,

105
00:03:39,985 --> 00:03:41,087
BUT OF COURSE YOU DON'T

106
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,355
NECESSARILY NEED A TRAILER

107
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,389
BECAUSE THE EASIEST WAY TO LEAD

108
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,423
A BOAT TO WATER IS JUST TO

109
00:03:44,423 --> 00:03:46,926
THROW THE PIG INTO YOUR VAN.

110
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:52,798
(GLASS SHATTERING)

111
00:03:52,798 --> 00:03:54,133
>>RED: ALL RIGHT YOU MIGHT

112
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,067
WANT TO CHECK THAT THE VAN

113
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:56,035
IS EMPTY FIRST.

114
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:56,969
YOU MIGHT HAVE YOUR CAMPING

115
00:03:56,969 --> 00:03:58,838
EQUIPMENT IN THERE OR IN

116
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,206
THIS CASE A CHANDELIER THAT

117
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:01,307
I PROMISED MY WIFE I'D

118
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,942
TAKE BACK TO THE STORE.

119
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,144
OKAY BOAT TRAILERS,

120
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:06,112
NOW BOAT TRAILERS COME

121
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:07,113
IN ALL SIZES, YOU MIGHT GET

122
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,782
A REAL SMALL BOAT TRAILER

123
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:10,649
OR YOU MIGHT HAVE A REAL

124
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:13,886
BIG BOAT TRAILER.

125
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,855
THIS ONE HERE, WE COULD JUST

126
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:16,622
FILL THIS UP WITH WATER

127
00:04:16,622 --> 00:04:17,456
AND GO CANOEING RIGHT IN

128
00:04:17,456 --> 00:04:19,458
THE TRAILER ITSELF, BUT MAYBE

129
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,626
SOME OF YOU DON'T HAVE $2,000

130
00:04:20,626 --> 00:04:22,161
BUCKS TO SPEND ON A TRAILER,

131
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,263
SO WHAT I SUGGEST IS YOU GET

132
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:26,031
ONE OF THEM TRAILER SPARE TIRES

133
00:04:26,031 --> 00:04:27,500
AND THEN YOU JUST CRUISE

134
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,801
THE HIGHWAYS LOOKING FOR AN

135
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,503
ABANDONED TRAILER WITH A FLAT.

136
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,437
YOU NOT ONLY GET A TRAILER

137
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,571
OUT OF THAT, YOU GET YOURSELF

138
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:33,739
USUALLY A HALF DECENT BOAT

139
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:34,874
AND MOTOR AND ONCE YOU FILE

140
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,275
OFF THE SERIAL NUMBERS YOU CAN

141
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:38,878
HAVE YOURSELF A NICE SUMMER.

142
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:39,678
BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T

143
00:04:39,678 --> 00:04:41,680
ENJOY PRISON FOOD WE'RE GOING

144
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,882
TO SHOW YOU HOW YOU CAN MAKE

145
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,817
YOUR OWN BOAT TRAILER TRANSPORT.

146
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,252
THE FORM OF TRANSPORTATION

147
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:48,120
YOU KNOW AND USING ANOTHER,

148
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,954
BUT FOR THAT YOU'RE GOING

149
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:50,055
TO NEED ANOTHER FORM

150
00:04:50,055 --> 00:04:53,158
OF TRANSPORTATION.

151
00:04:53,158 --> 00:04:54,860
GET YOURSELF A COUPLE

152
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,828
OF OLD BIKES,

153
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:56,762
I GOT THESE HERE FROM THE

154
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:57,730
POLICE AUCTION, THE COPS

155
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,000
STOLE THEM FROM HAROLD.

156
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,636
OH YEAH DON'T USE GOOD BIKES.

157
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,338
OKAY NOW THIS HERE IS YOUR

158
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:07,473
GALVANIZED STEEL PIPE AND YOU'RE

159
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,774
GOING TO NEED THAT FOR THE

160
00:05:08,774 --> 00:05:09,875
FRAMEWORK FOR YOUR BOAT TRAILER,

161
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:10,709
AND I GOT A BUNCH OF

162
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:11,644
JOINTS HERE.

163
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,678
I GOT T-JOINTS AND

164
00:05:12,678 --> 00:05:14,813
I GOT THE L-JOINTS AND

165
00:05:14,813 --> 00:05:16,048
I GOT X-JOINTS AND I GOT

166
00:05:16,048 --> 00:05:17,816
Q-JOINTS AND I GOT PRETTY

167
00:05:17,816 --> 00:05:19,585
WELL THE WHOLE ALPHABET HERE

168
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:20,486
BUT JUST THE CONSONANTS

169
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,654
NOT THE VOWELS.

170
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,055
DON'T, I MEAN LIKE AN O-JOINT

171
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:25,124
IS OF NO USE TO YOU AT ALL

172
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:26,258
AND OF COURSE A BEER JOINT

173
00:05:26,258 --> 00:05:27,559
THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY.

174
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:28,494
OKAY NOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING

175
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,495
TO NEED IS A HACKSAW TO CUT

176
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:35,200
THE GALVANIZED PIPING.

177
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,335
WELL YOU NEED A HACKSAW,

178
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:43,542
I USE POWER TOOLS.

179
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:48,380
>>HAROLD: AND NOW MY

180
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,348
FAVOURITE PART OF THE SHOW,

181
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,249
THE PART WE EXPOSE

182
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,183
THOSE 3 LITTLE WORDS THAT MEN

183
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:52,484
FIND SO DIFFICULT TO SAY,

184
00:05:52,484 --> 00:05:55,387
'I DON'T KNOW.'

185
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:56,789
AND HERE TO PROVE THAT POINT

186
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,023
IS MY UNCLE RED AND HIS BEST

187
00:05:58,023 --> 00:05:59,825
FRIEND IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD,

188
00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:09,134
TODAY IT'S MR. GLEN BRAXTON.

189
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:10,869
'DEAR EXPERTS, FOR YEARS

190
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:12,604
WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE

191
00:06:12,604 --> 00:06:13,739
COMMUNISTS WANTED TO CONTROL

192
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:14,740
THE WHOLE WORLD BUT IT

193
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,641
TURNED OUT THEY COULDN'T

194
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,509
EVEN CONTROL BULGARIA.

195
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:18,644
WHY DID THE ENTIRE COMMUNIST

196
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:19,478
SYSTEM COLLAPSE AND COULD

197
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:20,345
THE SAME THING HAPPEN

198
00:06:20,345 --> 00:06:24,650
TO CAPITALISM?

199
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,684
>>GLEN: I DON'T KNOW,

200
00:06:25,684 --> 00:06:27,085
I THINK THE REASON THE COMMUNIST

201
00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:28,120
SYSTEM COLLAPSED WAS ONE WORD

202
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,492
RECREATIONAL VEHICLES.

203
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:39,865
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A RUSKY R.V?

204
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:40,566
HAVE YOU EVER SEE KARL MARX

205
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,466
DRIVING AROUND IN

206
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:44,503
A MOTORHOME?

207
00:06:44,503 --> 00:06:45,137
>>HAROLD: OH NO,

208
00:06:45,137 --> 00:06:46,138
NO IT WASN'T HIM.

209
00:06:46,138 --> 00:06:47,706
>>GLEN: AND WHY NOT?

210
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:48,740
REMEMBER MAYDAY, YOU SEE I WAS

211
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,075
ON THE NEWS, THEY GOT THOSE

212
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:51,476
GUYS UP THERE WAVING AS ALL

213
00:06:51,476 --> 00:06:53,145
THE MISSILES GO BY AND ALL

214
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:56,915
THE TANKS GO BY BUT NOT ONE R.V.

215
00:06:56,915 --> 00:06:57,783
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

216
00:06:57,783 --> 00:06:58,617
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT PEOPLE

217
00:06:58,617 --> 00:06:59,484
TO ROAM AROUND IN

218
00:06:59,484 --> 00:07:00,786
THE SOVIET UNION, NO,

219
00:07:00,786 --> 00:07:01,787
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE THEM

220
00:07:01,787 --> 00:07:02,621
THEIR 4 TONS OF FREEDOM,

221
00:07:02,621 --> 00:07:03,689
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.

222
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,223
>>RED: YEAH.

223
00:07:05,223 --> 00:07:06,124
>>GLEN: YOU GOT THE K.G.B.

224
00:07:06,124 --> 00:07:07,125
YOU GOT THE U.S.S.R.

225
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:11,530
YOU GOT R.V.

226
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,531
COMMUNISM FELL AT THE KNEES

227
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:16,902
OF THE R.V.

228
00:07:16,902 --> 00:07:18,003
>>HAROLD: WELL THANK YOU

229
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:19,004
MR. BRAXTON FOR THAT INTERESTING

230
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:21,340
INSIGHT INTO GLOBAL POLITICS.

231
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,207
>>GLEN: YOU SHOW ME A SOCIETY

232
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:23,608
THAT DOESN'T HAVE R.V.'S HAROLD

233
00:07:23,608 --> 00:07:24,810
AND I'LL SHOW YOU A SOCIETY

234
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,078
THAT'S POLITICALLY AND MORALLY

235
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:30,015
AND SPIRITUALLY CORRUPT.

236
00:07:30,015 --> 00:07:30,882
>>RED: THE WINNEBAGO

237
00:07:30,882 --> 00:07:33,518
DOMINO THEORY.

238
00:07:34,786 --> 00:07:35,787
>>RED: IT IS WINTER,

239
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:36,755
THE SNOW ON THE MOUNTAIN

240
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:38,457
REMINDS ME OF UNCLE LARRY.

241
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:40,325
UNCLE LARRY WAS NOT EDUCATED

242
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:41,993
BUT HE KNEW THE WOODS,

243
00:07:41,993 --> 00:07:43,462
CONIFEROUS HE WOULD SAY,

244
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:44,496
WHAT THE HECK DOES

245
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:45,664
CONIFEROUS MEAN?

246
00:07:45,664 --> 00:07:47,332
OR ECOLOGY, HE WOULD SAY,

247
00:07:47,332 --> 00:07:50,068
WHAT THE HECK DOES ECOLOGY MEAN?

248
00:07:50,068 --> 00:07:51,236
I REMEMBER THAT LAST TIME

249
00:07:51,236 --> 00:07:52,471
WE WERE HIKING ON THE SNOWY

250
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:53,939
MOUNTAIN AND UNCLE LARRY

251
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:55,907
SAID HIS LAST WORDS TO ME,

252
00:07:55,907 --> 00:07:57,642
AVALANCHE HE SAID TO ME,

253
00:07:57,642 --> 00:08:02,747
WHAT THE HECK DOES AVA?

254
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:10,922
>>RED: ALL RIGHT, OH I FORGOT,

255
00:08:10,922 --> 00:08:12,157
YOU MIGHT WANT TO MEASURE

256
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:13,391
THE WIDTH OF THE CANOE FIRST

257
00:08:13,391 --> 00:08:15,494
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S

258
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:18,730
WIDE ENOUGH.

259
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,465
I GOT LUCKY THERE...

260
00:08:20,465 --> 00:08:22,300
OKAY NOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO

261
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,703
IS CHECK THE CUT END OF THE PIPE

262
00:08:24,703 --> 00:08:26,204
TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY METAL

263
00:08:26,204 --> 00:08:27,405
SPURS OR SLIPPERS

264
00:08:27,405 --> 00:08:29,941
OR WHAT HAVE YOU.

265
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:33,879
YEAH, SHE'S LOADED WITH THEM.

266
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,814
ALL RIGHT NOW WE TAKE A FEW

267
00:08:35,814 --> 00:08:36,948
OF THESE L-JOINTS AND T-JOINTS

268
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:38,383
AND WHAT HAVE YOU AND YOU

269
00:08:38,383 --> 00:08:39,284
GOT TO CONNECT THEM TO THE

270
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:40,585
BIKES SO THAT WE CAN THEN

271
00:08:40,585 --> 00:08:41,786
CONNECT THE RODS ACROSS TO THE

272
00:08:41,786 --> 00:08:43,622
BIKES AND MAKE OUR FRAMEWORK.

273
00:08:43,622 --> 00:08:44,723
SO WE'LL TAKE ONE OF THESE

274
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:46,958
T-JOINTS HERE AND JUST

275
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:47,826
STICK THAT DOWN RIGHT

276
00:08:47,826 --> 00:08:53,798
ON THE HANDLEBAR.

277
00:08:53,798 --> 00:08:56,635
NOW HOW'S THAT GOING TO HOOK

278
00:08:56,635 --> 00:09:06,311
ON THERE IF IT'S SO SOLID?

279
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:07,379
MAYBE ONE OF THESE...

280
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:08,146
WELL I THINK WHAT WE'LL

281
00:09:08,146 --> 00:09:09,047
HAVE TO USE HERE IS THE

282
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:09,814
HANDYMAN'S SECRET WEAPON,

283
00:09:09,814 --> 00:09:13,852
DUCT TAPE.

284
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:15,587
AND THERE YOU HAVE IT,

285
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:17,389
AND YOU JUST SAVED YOURSELF

286
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:18,123
A $1,000 BUCKS.

287
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:18,990
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE NOT

288
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:19,891
USING IT AS A BOAT TRAILER

289
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:20,892
YOU CAN USE IT AS A BICYCLE

290
00:09:20,892 --> 00:09:22,027
BUILT FOR 2 AND IT'S ACTUALLY

291
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:23,094
BETTER THAN THE REAL BICYCLE

292
00:09:23,094 --> 00:09:24,295
BUILT FOR 2 BECAUSE ON THEM

293
00:09:24,295 --> 00:09:25,296
THE GUY ON THE BACK GETS

294
00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:27,799
KIND OF A SCARY VIEW.

295
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,733
OKAY SO OUR TRAILER'S READY

296
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:30,168
FOR OUR LOAD,

297
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:31,035
SO LET'S GET OUR LOAD AND

298
00:09:31,035 --> 00:09:33,104
PUT HER ON THE TRAILER.

299
00:09:33,104 --> 00:09:41,780
HOOK THE BOTTOM UP, UP SHE GOES,

300
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,282
OKAY JUST PUT HER ON THERE

301
00:09:44,282 --> 00:09:49,587
STRAIGHTEN HER UP.

302
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:53,358
A LITTLE BIT OF DUCT TAPE,

303
00:09:53,358 --> 00:09:56,661
LOTS OF DUCT TAPE

304
00:09:56,661 --> 00:10:05,270
THERE SHE GOES.

305
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,839
NOW WE JUST TAKE OUR TONGUE

306
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:08,606
AND WELL NOT OUR TONGUE,

307
00:10:08,606 --> 00:10:09,807
THE TONGUE OF THE TRAILER

308
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:10,642
AND HOOK HER ONTO

309
00:10:10,642 --> 00:10:16,714
THE HITCH HERE,

310
00:10:16,714 --> 00:10:17,582
OKAY AND THEN ANOTHER LITTLE

311
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:18,850
PIECE OF DUCT TAPE,

312
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,185
SAFETY FIRST.

313
00:10:21,185 --> 00:10:25,590
AND THERE YOU HAVE IT,

314
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,958
SO UNTIL NEXT TIME REMEMBER

315
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:27,959
IF THE WOMEN DON'T

316
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:28,760
FIND YOU HANDSOME,

317
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,994
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST FIND

318
00:10:29,994 --> 00:10:30,795
YOU HANDY...

319
00:10:30,795 --> 00:10:33,331

00:11:18,543 --> 00:11:23,448
>>RED: YEAH.

340
00:11:23,448 --> 00:11:24,215
>>BOB: WELL THAT WAS

341
00:11:24,215 --> 00:11:24,982
A VERY GOOD JOKE.

342
00:11:24,982 --> 00:11:27,318
>>RED: THANK YOU, YEAH.

343
00:11:27,318 --> 00:11:28,186
>>BOB: ESPECIALLY THE PART

344
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:29,053
ABOUT THE BALL IN

345
00:11:29,053 --> 00:11:29,887
THE GROUNDHOG HOLE.

346
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:30,755
>>RED: OH NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,

347
00:11:30,755 --> 00:11:33,024
I'M SERIOUS ABOUT THAT PART.

348
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:34,559
>>BOB: NO, RED NO,

349
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,194
IT'S EITHER ALL A JOKE

350
00:11:36,194 --> 00:11:37,862
OR IT'S ALL SERIOUS,

351
00:11:37,862 --> 00:11:39,030
THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS.

352
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,864
>>RED: OH.

353
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:40,565
>>BOB: AND SINCE THE BALL

354
00:11:40,565 --> 00:11:41,866
IN THE CUP WAS A JOKE,

355
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:42,767
WELL I'M GOING TO HAVE

356
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:47,939
TO TAKE A FREE DROP, SORRY.

357
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:48,840
>>RED: BUSTER SAID YOU

358
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,740
WANTED TO SEE ME ABOUT

359
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,809
SOMETHING BOB.

360
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:53,211
>>BOB: OH YEAH THAT'S RIGHT RED,

361
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:55,079
I HEAR THAT MOOSE HAS MADE

362
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:56,414
A SLINGSHOT OUT OF

363
00:11:56,414 --> 00:11:59,750
SURGICAL TUBING.

364
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,918
AND HE'S PLANNING TO WATER-SKI

365
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:02,220
WITH IT BY SLING SHOOTING

366
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,622
HIMSELF ACROSS THE LAKE.

367
00:12:04,622 --> 00:12:05,356
>>RED: WELL I DIDN'T KNOW THAT

368
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:06,324
BUT IT CERTAINLY FITS HIS

369
00:12:06,324 --> 00:12:12,029
PERSONALITY PROFILE.

370
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:13,731
>>BOB: ANOTHER JOKE.

371
00:12:13,731 --> 00:12:16,000
>>RED: OH YEAH.

372
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,268
>>BOB: WELL RED DOESN'T IT

373
00:12:17,268 --> 00:12:20,538
SEEM LIKE A TRIVIAL USE OF

374
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:21,405
A HIGH-TECH PIECE OF MEDICAL

375
00:12:21,405 --> 00:12:24,208
EQUIPMENT TO YOU?

376
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:27,144
SLINGSHOT WATERSKIING, COME ON!

377
00:12:27,144 --> 00:12:28,079
>>RED: WELL I'M SURPRISINGLY

378
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,114
UNCONCERNED ABOUT IT BOB.

379
00:12:30,114 --> 00:12:31,082
>>BOB: MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE

380
00:12:31,082 --> 00:12:32,550
CONCERNED ABOUT IT RED,

381
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,517
I MEAN IT COULD BE

382
00:12:33,517 --> 00:12:35,319
ENVIRONMENTALLY HAZARDOUS,

383
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:36,420
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE FLYING

384
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,388
HEADFIRST INTO TREES AND

385
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:39,390
DENTING THEM, I MIGHT HAVE

386
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,791
TO CONFISCATE THAT HOSE FROM

387
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:45,429
MOOSE AND COULD YOU IMAGINE

388
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:47,031
HOW FAR THAT BABY COULD

389
00:12:47,031 --> 00:12:49,567
FIRE A GOLF BALL?

390
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:55,439
IT COULD PUT ME ON THE PRO TOUR.

391
00:13:00,778 --> 00:13:02,279
>>RED: WELL MOOSE THOMPSON'S

392
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,148
SLINGSHOT WATERSKIING UNIT

393
00:13:04,148 --> 00:13:10,254
WAS A BIT OF A BUST.

394
00:13:10,254 --> 00:13:10,988
>>HAROLD: UNCLE RED

395
00:13:10,988 --> 00:13:12,423
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

396
00:13:12,423 --> 00:13:14,825
>>RED: NOTHING GOOD HAROLD.

397
00:13:14,825 --> 00:13:15,593
HAVE YOU TRIED THE SLINGSHOT

398
00:13:15,593 --> 00:13:16,761
WATER-SKI THING YET?

399
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:17,695
>>HAROLD: WELL I WANTED TO

400
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,729
BUT JUST EVERY TIME I GOT UP

401
00:13:18,729 --> 00:13:19,830
TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE MOOSE

402
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,098
KEPT SLING SHOOTING ME TO

403
00:13:21,098 --> 00:13:22,566
THE BACK.

404
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:23,667
ONCE WAS FUNNY BUT AFTER 6 TIMES

405
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:26,003
I GIVE UP YOU KNOW.

406
00:13:26,003 --> 00:13:27,004
>>RED: WELL THE PROBLEM IS

407
00:13:27,004 --> 00:13:28,038
THEY GOT THE THING WORKING

408
00:13:28,038 --> 00:13:29,073
REAL GREAT,

409
00:13:29,073 --> 00:13:30,107
BUT YOU KNOW ONCE MEN GET

410
00:13:30,107 --> 00:13:31,242
SOMETHING WORKING THEY'RE

411
00:13:31,242 --> 00:13:32,943
IMMEDIATELY BORED WITH IT,

412
00:13:32,943 --> 00:13:34,578
SO THEY WANTED TO TRY SOMETHING

413
00:13:34,578 --> 00:13:36,113
CALLED THE DOUBLE SHOOTER,

414
00:13:36,113 --> 00:13:37,114
SO INSTEAD OF ONE GUY,

415
00:13:37,114 --> 00:13:38,549
JUNIOR AND MOOSE BOTH HOPPED

416
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:39,717
UP INTO THE SLING THERE

417
00:13:39,717 --> 00:13:41,185
AND THEN ALL THE OTHER GUYS

418
00:13:41,185 --> 00:13:42,419
GOT TOGETHER AND PULLED

419
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:43,487
THE TUBING BACK AND THEY PULLED

420
00:13:43,487 --> 00:13:45,122
IT SO HARD THAT THE TREES THAT

421
00:13:45,122 --> 00:13:46,123
IT WAS TIED TO RIPPED RIGHT

422
00:13:46,123 --> 00:13:47,291
OUT OF THE GROUND AND

423
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,693
SHOT PAST THEM.

424
00:13:49,693 --> 00:13:50,628
>>HAROLD: THE SLINGSHOT

425
00:13:50,628 --> 00:13:51,562
WASN'T MADE BY ACME COMPANY

426
00:13:51,562 --> 00:13:54,398
BY ANY CHANCE WAS IT?

427
00:13:54,398 --> 00:13:55,566
>>RED: NO WHY?

428
00:13:55,566 --> 00:13:57,401
>>HAROLD: JUST ASKING,

429
00:13:57,401 --> 00:14:00,905
BEEP! BEEP!

430
00:14:00,905 --> 00:14:01,872
>>RED: ANYWAY IT'S NOT VERY

431
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:02,973
OFTEN YOU SEE A BIRCH TREE AND

432
00:14:02,973 --> 00:14:04,141
ITS ENTIRE ROOT SYSTEM DOING

433
00:14:04,141 --> 00:14:10,080
900 MILES AN HOUR EVEN UP HERE.

434
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,182
AND WHEN THE TREES ZIPPED PAST

435
00:14:12,182 --> 00:14:13,183
THE GUYS IT ACTUALLY LIFTED

436
00:14:13,183 --> 00:14:14,351
THEM RIGHT OFF THEIR FEET,

437
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:15,686
SO WE HAD A WHOLE BALL OF KIND

438
00:14:15,686 --> 00:14:17,021
OF PLANT AND ANIMAL LIFE

439
00:14:17,021 --> 00:14:18,255
HURTLING TOWARD THE 2-HOLER

440
00:14:18,255 --> 00:14:20,658
WHICH I WAS COMING OUT OF.

441
00:14:20,658 --> 00:14:23,060
>>HAROLD: WOO, HOLY!

442
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,261
>>RED: WELL THEY YELLED TO

443
00:14:24,261 --> 00:14:25,195
WARN ME BUT THEY WERE TRAVELLING

444
00:14:25,195 --> 00:14:26,597
FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF SOUND,

445
00:14:26,597 --> 00:14:27,765
SO I DIDN'T ACTUALLY HEAR THEM

446
00:14:27,765 --> 00:14:29,466
UNTIL 4 MINUTES AFTER THEY HIT

447
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:30,367
ME WHICH REALLY WASN'T ALL

448
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:32,703
THAT HELPFUL.

449
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,671
>>HAROLD: WELL I GUESS THAT'S

450
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:34,705
THE END OF THE SLINGSHOT THING

451
00:14:34,705 --> 00:14:37,541
AND THE OUTHOUSE TOO.

452
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,542
>>RED: NO, NOW EVERYBODY WANTS

453
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:40,744
TO TRY THE DOUBLE SHOT THING,

454
00:14:40,744 --> 00:14:41,478
I MEAN THESE GUYS NEVER HEARD

455
00:14:41,478 --> 00:14:43,614
OF LIVE AND LEARN.

456
00:14:43,614 --> 00:14:44,381

00:16:47,537 --> 00:16:48,438
>>RED: I REALLY WISH BILL GAVE

507
00:16:48,438 --> 00:16:49,406
US A LITTLE MORE WARNING

508
00:16:49,406 --> 00:16:51,942
YOU KNOW WHEN HE'S COMING OVER,

509
00:16:51,942 --> 00:16:54,644
2 OR 3 YEARS.

510
00:16:54,644 --> 00:16:56,380
YEAH THANK YOU BILL.

511
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,514
DON'T TOUCH IT, DON'T TOUCH IT,

512
00:16:57,514 --> 00:16:59,282
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE HAT!

513
00:16:59,282 --> 00:17:00,317
TIME NOW FOR

514
00:17:00,317 --> 00:17:03,053
'ADVENTURES WITH BILL'

515
00:17:03,053 --> 00:17:06,423
STARRING BILL.

516
00:17:06,423 --> 00:17:08,391
OW! NOW THE IDEA HERE WAS,

517
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:10,160
OH GOD.

518
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,027
>>BILL: WHOA!

519
00:17:11,027 --> 00:17:11,962
>>RED: THIS MAY NOT

520
00:17:11,962 --> 00:17:12,896
LAST TOO LONG.

521
00:17:12,896 --> 00:17:13,730
ALL RIGHT HE'S GOING TO,

522
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,731
THE IDEA BEING WE'RE TRYING

523
00:17:14,731 --> 00:17:15,665
TO RAKE UP THE LEAVES,

524
00:17:15,665 --> 00:17:16,833
IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR WHEN

525
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:17,834
THE LEAVES FALL DOWN IN

526
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:18,735
THE FOREST AND SO ON AND

527
00:17:18,735 --> 00:17:19,970
I WAS TRYING TO, BUT BILL SAYS

528
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:20,904
NO, NO, THERE'S A BETTER WAY,

529
00:17:20,904 --> 00:17:21,838
HE STOLE THAT DUCT TAPE

530
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:22,706
RIGHT OFF MY WORKBENCH

531
00:17:22,706 --> 00:17:24,207
I'LL BET YOU.

532
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:26,309
SO THE TROUBLE WITH BILL IS,

533
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:27,110
WELL I WAS GOING TO SAY HE'S

534
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,078
ALWAYS THINKING BUT HE'S

535
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:29,045
NOT ALWAYS THINKING,

536
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:30,147
HE'S ALWAYS DOING STUFF

537
00:17:30,147 --> 00:17:32,415
AND THEN THINKING LATER.

538
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,417
BUT THE IDEA HERE WAS HE THOUGHT

539
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:35,285
IF HE TAPED A COUPLE OF THOSE

540
00:17:35,285 --> 00:17:36,953
RAKES TO HIS BELT LOOPS

541
00:17:36,953 --> 00:17:38,188
AND WE GOT THEM,

542
00:17:38,188 --> 00:17:39,589
THEY'RE ON THERE REAL SECURE,

543
00:17:39,589 --> 00:17:40,824
THEN HE HOLDS THE ONE RAKE

544
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:41,791
IN EACH HAND, HE'S REALLY,

545
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:42,726
HE CAN DO THE WORK OF

546
00:17:42,726 --> 00:17:44,227
4 PEOPLE ALL AT ONE TIME

547
00:17:44,227 --> 00:17:47,163
JUST RUNNING AROUND.

548
00:17:47,163 --> 00:17:48,331
BUT HE WENT OVER THE BIKE AND

549
00:17:48,331 --> 00:17:50,166
IT CAUGHT THERE AND THEN BILL,

550
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,668
BOY THAT DUCT TAPE REALLY

551
00:17:51,668 --> 00:17:53,069
HANGS IN DOESN'T IT?

552
00:17:53,069 --> 00:17:53,803
YOU COULD USE A BIT OF

553
00:17:53,803 --> 00:17:54,871
DUCT TAPE WITH SOME OF THOSE

554
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:55,972
AND THEN HE GOT ONE OF THESE

555
00:17:55,972 --> 00:17:59,843
LEAF BLOWERS WHICH YOU KNOW,

556
00:17:59,843 --> 00:18:02,545
BILL, BILL, BILL, BILL, OH GOD!

557
00:18:02,545 --> 00:18:03,546
YOU KNOW THE TROUBLE IS WHEN

558
00:18:03,546 --> 00:18:04,514
A LOT OF TIMES WHEN YOU RENT

559
00:18:04,514 --> 00:18:05,448
EQUIPMENT YOU DON'T GET

560
00:18:05,448 --> 00:18:06,583
THE INSTRUCTIONS WITH IT.

561
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,451
(BILL SCREAMING)

562
00:18:08,451 --> 00:18:09,286
>>RED: AND I'M NOT SURE IF BILL

563
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:10,320
WAS COMPLETELY SURE WHAT HE WAS

564
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,223
DOING THERE, ANYWAY THIS IS IT.

565
00:18:13,223 --> 00:18:14,391
NOW THIS ONE I FOUND WAS VERY

566
00:18:14,391 --> 00:18:16,326
INTRIGUING, HE HAD ONE OF THEM

567
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:17,861
PLASTIC GARBAGE CANS AND HE

568
00:18:17,861 --> 00:18:18,928
SAYS THE IMPORTANT THING HERE

569
00:18:18,928 --> 00:18:20,096
IS YOU GOT TO SEAL THIS INTO

570
00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:21,164
IT IS COMPLETELY AIR TIGHT,

571
00:18:21,164 --> 00:18:22,432
GET THAT LID ON THERE RIGHT

572
00:18:22,432 --> 00:18:23,400
PROPERLY, THEN HE TAKES A HUGE

573
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,869
THING OUT OF HIS PANTS,

574
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:27,871
IT SCARED MOST OF US...

575
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:28,805
BUT HE FIRES THAT THROUGH

576
00:18:28,805 --> 00:18:29,739
THE LID OF THE GARBAGE CAN,

577
00:18:29,739 --> 00:18:30,640
NOW THE IDEA IS THAT APPARENTLY

578
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,409
THAT PICKAXE MAKES, OKAY.

579
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:33,977
>>BILL: OH, WHOA!

580
00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:34,944
>>RED: IT MAKES A HOLE EXACTLY

581
00:18:34,944 --> 00:18:37,113
THE SAME SIZE AS THE HOSE,

582
00:18:37,113 --> 00:18:38,715
SO WANT HE WANTED ME TO DO WAS

583
00:18:38,715 --> 00:18:40,316
TO TAKE THE END OF THE HOSE,

584
00:18:40,316 --> 00:18:41,217
STICK IT IN THE HOLE THEN

585
00:18:41,217 --> 00:18:42,352
IT'S LIKE AN AIRTIGHT SEAL

586
00:18:42,352 --> 00:18:43,520
IN THERE AND THEN HE'S GOING

587
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,821
TO GET THE OTHER END OF THE HOSE

588
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:45,789
AND I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING

589
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:46,589
TO BLOW IN THIS BUT NO HE'S

590
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:48,224
GOING TO SUCK ON IT,

591
00:18:48,224 --> 00:18:49,092
HE'S GOING TO SUCK ALL

592
00:18:49,092 --> 00:18:50,393
THE AIR OF IT THERE,

593
00:18:50,393 --> 00:18:51,361
BUT I THINK THE PROBLEM HERE

594
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:52,929
WAS WITH IT BEING PLASTIC

595
00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:55,265
AND SO ON.

596
00:18:55,265 --> 00:18:56,099
BASICALLY ALL HE DID WAS

597
00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:58,568
COLLAPSE THE CAN AT THIS POINT

598
00:18:58,568 --> 00:18:59,436
SO IT REALLY WASN'T MUCH OF

599
00:18:59,436 --> 00:19:01,471
A USE SO, WE GOT TO RETHINK

600
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:02,439
THIS YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO,

601
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:04,441
THIS IS SPEED.

602
00:19:04,441 --> 00:19:05,408
>>GUY: HEY!

603
00:19:05,408 --> 00:19:06,643
>>RED: OOPS, THIS WAS PLAN 'A'.

604
00:19:06,643 --> 00:19:07,811
>>BILL: OH!

605
00:19:07,811 --> 00:19:08,678
>>RED: OH, OH, OH, OH.

606
00:19:08,678 --> 00:19:09,479
PLAN 'B' WAS HE WANTED ME TO

607
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:12,282
GET A METAL GARBAGE CAN,

608
00:19:12,282 --> 00:19:13,950
THIS WAS HEAVY BOY I'M

609
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:14,984
TELLING YOU, IT DOESN'T LOOK

610
00:19:14,984 --> 00:19:16,219
THAT HEAVY BUT IT, NO, NO,

611
00:19:16,219 --> 00:19:17,554
NO, BILL, HE TRIED TO PICK

612
00:19:17,554 --> 00:19:18,721
THESE UP AND BOY GOLLY WE WERE.

613
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:22,759
(AXE WHIZZING THROUGH THE AIR)

614
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:24,093
>>RED: OH WELL I DON'T

615
00:19:24,093 --> 00:19:24,894
STAY IN THAT CABIN ANY MORE

616
00:19:24,894 --> 00:19:25,862
BECAUSE THERE IS A PEEPHOLE

617
00:19:25,862 --> 00:19:26,696
IN THERE NOW.

618
00:19:26,696 --> 00:19:27,597
NOW HE SUCKS ALL THE AIR OUT,

619
00:19:27,597 --> 00:19:29,232
THE TROUBLE WAS HE'S BRINGING

620
00:19:29,232 --> 00:19:30,433
UP A LOT OF STUFF.

621
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:32,368
YOU KNOW HINDSIGHT IS A

622
00:19:32,368 --> 00:19:33,269
GREAT THING, I THINK WE SHOULD

623
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:34,370
OF EMPTIED IT OUT, A LOT OF OLD,

624
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,839
ROTTEN LEAVES AND ACTUALLY

625
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:37,740
I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THAT WAS

626
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,143
WE HAVEN'T HAD A PONY AT

627
00:19:40,143 --> 00:19:42,979
THE LODGE FOR YEARS.

628
00:19:42,979 --> 00:19:45,582
ANYWAY WE GOT THAT OUT OF THERE

629
00:19:45,582 --> 00:19:46,616
AND WE GET THE LID ON THERE

630
00:19:46,616 --> 00:19:47,684
AND NOW HE'S GOT IT AIRTIGHT,

631
00:19:47,684 --> 00:19:48,651
YEAH IT'S WORKING AND YOU

632
00:19:48,651 --> 00:19:50,253
CAN SEE IT JUST STARTING,

633
00:19:50,253 --> 00:19:51,154
IT COMPRESSES A LITTLE

634
00:19:51,154 --> 00:19:51,988
BUT NOT TOO MUCH.

635
00:19:51,988 --> 00:19:52,789
THE IDEA BEING HERE WHAT YOU'RE

636
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:53,823
TRYING TO DO IS CREATE

637
00:19:53,823 --> 00:19:56,292
A VACUUM INSIDE THE CAN.

638
00:19:56,292 --> 00:19:57,760
THERE WE GO AND I KEEP MY THUMB

639
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,962
OVER SO WE GOT THAT CONTAINED

640
00:19:58,962 --> 00:20:01,864
AND WHEN HE TAKES THE TOP OFF

641
00:20:01,864 --> 00:20:02,665
IT'S JUST LIKE OPENING THE DOORS

642
00:20:02,665 --> 00:20:04,734
FROM STAR TREK, YOU GET THAT,

643
00:20:04,734 --> 00:20:06,469
IT'S LIKE A COMPLETE VACUUM,

644
00:20:06,469 --> 00:20:07,303
I THINK THE SAME THING

645
00:20:07,303 --> 00:20:09,272
IS UNDER BILL'S TOQUE.

646
00:20:09,272 --> 00:20:10,239
ANYWAY HE'S GOT ALL THE LEAVES

647
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:12,108
IN THERE AND HE'S AS HAPPY

648
00:20:12,108 --> 00:20:14,677
AS HECK BUT I JUST DIDN'T

649
00:20:14,677 --> 00:20:15,345
GET TO HURT HIM AS MUCH

650
00:20:15,345 --> 00:20:16,379
AS I WANTED TO.

651
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:17,780
>>BILL: OW!

652
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,417
>>RED: HERE'S RANGER GORD TO

653
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:22,318
TELL US ALL WHAT HE DOES WHEN

654
00:20:22,318 --> 00:20:24,120
HE SPOTS A FOREST FIRE.

655
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,987
>>GORD: SURE WELL THE FIRST

656
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:26,255
THING I'LL DO IS I'LL DETERMINE

657
00:20:26,255 --> 00:20:28,091
THE EXACT LOCATION USING

658
00:20:28,091 --> 00:20:30,526
MY COMPASS AND MY BINOC...

659
00:20:30,526 --> 00:20:33,329
(BINOCULARS GLASS SMASHING)

660
00:20:33,329 --> 00:20:34,297
>>RED: OH BOY.

661
00:20:34,297 --> 00:20:36,099
>>GORD: WELL USUALLY I

662
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:40,269
CAN JUST USE MY COMPASS.

663
00:20:40,269 --> 00:20:41,003
BOY I HOPE THOSE DON'T RUST

664
00:20:41,003 --> 00:20:43,439
OUT IN THE RAIN LIKE THIS.

665
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:45,007
ANYWAY, I'LL DETERMINE

666
00:20:45,007 --> 00:20:49,312
THE EXACT, WHOA!

667
00:20:49,312 --> 00:20:54,217
THAT LIGHTNING STRIKE WAS CLOSE.

668
00:20:54,217 --> 00:20:55,017
MR. GREEN I'LL DETERMINE

669
00:20:55,017 --> 00:20:56,352
THE EXACT LOCATION USING MY

670
00:20:56,352 --> 00:20:58,087
COMPASS AND THEN I'LL CALL

671
00:20:58,087 --> 00:21:01,224
