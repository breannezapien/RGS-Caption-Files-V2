You know, nothing seems
to bother my wife more

00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,409
than finding beard
trimmings in the sink.

3
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:11,010
These little guys are
harder to get rid of

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,279
than ants at a picnic.

5
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:15,648
They never all go
down the drain

6
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,183
and if you try
to wipe them up

7
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:20,220
you just end up
spreading them around.

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,956
This made me think
there must be a faster,

9
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:25,658
smarter way to deal
with the situation.

10
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:27,694
Well faster anyway.

11
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,195
So here's what you do,

12
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,964
before starting to
trim your beard

13

put on a good thick layer
of our old friend gunpowder.

14

You know in the old days
they used to powder wigs.

15

This is a lot
more practical.

16
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:45,078
Okay, step two,

17
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,713
just trim your
beard over the sink

18
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,381
the same way as usual

19
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,316
unless you're a chain smoker

20
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:53,286
in which case you should
probably be outside

not you will be.

Don't hate me
because I'm beautiful.

last easy step,

a lot of grief

about driving around
in a gas guzzler.

182

Now to me,
it was all talk

183
00:08:01,313 --> 00:08:02,981
but then I filled up
the tank the other day

184
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:04,382
and it cost the
same as what

185
00:08:04,382 --> 00:08:07,052
I paid for the vehicle
in the first place.

186

Of course, Junior Singleton
says look at the bright side,

187
00:08:09,354 --> 00:08:12,958
a full tank of gas doubles
the value of the van.

188
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,559
But when I want

So today on Handyman Corner,

191
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,199
I'm going to build
an energy-efficient car

192
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,368
that's going to
save me money

193
00:08:23,368 --> 00:08:26,972
and make me look smart.

194
00:08:26,972 --> 00:08:29,641
You know, the key to an
energy-efficient vehicle

195
00:08:29,641 --> 00:08:31,009
is really the weight.

196
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:33,478
The lower the weight, the
less horsepower you need

197
00:08:33,478 --> 00:08:36,214
which is really why you
never see a 200-pound jockey

198
00:08:36,214 --> 00:08:38,650
and of course, the simplest
way to keep the weight down

199
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,452
is to keep the size down.

200
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:43,955
Which is way you never see a
six-foot-four jockey either.

201
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:45,457
Okay, well I've got
the weight down,

202
00:08:45,457 --> 00:08:46,558
I've got the size down

203
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:48,293
but I've still got
to compromise.

204
00:08:48,293 --> 00:08:51,296
Which is fine, most of the
lodge members welcome
comprising positions.

205
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:53,231
For example, I'm
running this vehicle

206
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:55,100
off a floor
polisher motor

207
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,802
powered by a car battery
running through an inverter.

208
00:08:57,802 --> 00:08:59,738
The good news is,
I don't have to buy gas.

209
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:01,239
The bad news is
I don't have

210
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:03,675
enough power to
turn the wheels.

211

Away you go.

477
00:20:19,682 --> 00:20:21,284
Work it, work it,
work it.

[ CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ]

479
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:24,954
So if my wife is watching,

480
00:20:24,954 --> 00:20:26,689
I'll be coming straight
home after the meeting

481
00:20:26,689 --> 00:20:28,324
and you'd think after
spending the whole day

482
00:20:28,324 --> 00:20:29,625
with Harold in that costume,

483
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,661
I'd be tired of
seeing a lady bear

484
00:20:31,661 --> 00:20:33,863
but apparently I'm not.

485
00:20:33,863 --> 00:20:35,498
And to the rest of you,
thanks for watching.

486
00:20:35,498 --> 00:20:36,866
On behalf of myself and
Harold and the whole gang

487
00:20:36,866 --> 00:20:38,334
up here at Possum lodge,

488
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:40,002
keep your stick on the ice.

489

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

490
00:20:45,942 --> 00:20:48,077
Sit down.

491
00:20:48,077 --> 00:20:49,846
You've got to sit down now.

492
00:20:49,846 --> 00:20:50,713
Sit down.

493
00:20:50,713 --> 00:20:51,981
Sit down in the back.

494
00:20:51,981 --> 00:20:55,718
All rise.

495
00:20:55,718 --> 00:20:58,855
Quando omni flunkus moritati.

496
00:20:58,855 --> 00:21:00,756
Sit down.

497
00:21:00,756 --> 00:21:03,159
Bow your heads
for the man's prayer.

498
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:04,393
I'm a man

499
00:21:04,393 --> 00:21:05,695
but I can change

500
00:21:05,695 --> 00:21:07,230
if I have to

501
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,265
I guess.

502
00:21:09,265 --> 00:21:11,000
Okay, Buster Hatfield,
I see you back there.

503
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,369
Stand up, stand up.

504
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:14,804
All right, Buster's
going to give us

505
00:21:14,804 --> 00:21:16,072
a big apology
in a minute

506
00:21:16,072 --> 00:21:17,206
but before he does that

507
00:21:17,206 --> 00:21:19,675
I think we all have to
be mature enough to admit

508
00:21:19,675 --> 00:21:22,445
there is no such thing
as a sasquatch.

509
00:21:22,445 --> 00:21:25,281
Okay, I mean, it's a
figment of our imagination.

510
00:21:25,281 --> 00:21:29,485
It has nothing to do
with any type of reality

511
00:21:29,485 --> 00:21:32,121
and I think it's part
of growing up

512
00:21:32,121 --> 00:21:34,023
and when you're a kid, fine,

513
00:21:34,023 --> 00:21:38,094
there's things like fairies
and there are fairies

514
00:21:38,094 --> 00:21:41,797
but a sasquatch... no.
