1
00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:05,905
ARE JUST IMPROVEMENTS ON
EXISTING TECHNOLOGY.

2
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:08,575
I'M TALKING ABOUT LASER
BEAMS, NUCLEAR POWER,

3
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:11,244
EVEN THE
JIFFY-POP POPCORN.

4
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:13,913
IN THE OLD DAYS PEOPLE USED
TO PAINT THEIR HOUSES
WITH A PAINT BRUSH,

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,516
BUT THEN SOME GUY INVENTED
THE PAINT ROLLER.

6
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,786
NOW, TODAY I'M GOING TO
PUT ON A COAT OF CLEAR
DRIVEWAY SEALER,

7
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:22,422
AND YES, I'M GOING TO USE THE
PAINT ROLLER TECHNOLOGY.

8
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,824
BUT I'M TAKING HER TO
A WHOLE NEW LEVEL.

9
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:52,452
[applause]

10
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:57,290
ALL RIGHT.

11
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:00,026
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.

12
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,396
YEAH, WELL,
I APPRECIATE THAT.

13
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,965
WE'VE GOT A BIT OF A SITUATION
UP AT THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

14
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:09,903
SOME GIANT BIRD HAS CHOSEN THE
CHIMNEY AT POSSUM LODGE HERE

15
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:12,105
AS ITS NESTING PLACE.

16
00:01:12,171 --> 00:01:13,640
YOU SHOULD SEE THIS THING.

17
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:16,042
IT'S GOT THE SKINNY LEGS
AND THE WING SPAN IT'S LIKE,

18
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,077
KIND OF DOES A THING
WHERE IT JUST --

19
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,412
OH,
IT'S OKAY, RED,

20
00:01:19,445 --> 00:01:21,481
I'LL COME BACK WHEN YOUR
DEODORANT DRIES.

21
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:25,051
NO, I WAS JUST
TELLING EVERYBODY ABOUT
THE BIG BIRD WE GOT HERE.

22
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,221
OH, YEAH, YEAH.
QUITE THE STIR, ISN'T IT?
OH, GEEZ, THAT'S CAUSING

23
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,957
YOU KNOW WHAT, I SMELL
A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY HERE.

24
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:33,092
WELL, SURE, YOU KNOW,
A GIANT BIRD FLYING
THROUGH THE SKY,

25
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,695
GREAT TIME TO
OPEN A CAR WASH.

26
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:38,865
RED, IT'S A WHOOPING CRANE.
THEY'RE PRACTICALLY EXTINCT.

27
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:41,300
WELL, I KNOW
HOW THEY FEEL.

28
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:46,205
YEAH.
THE EGG IN THE BIRD'S NEST?
HAVE YOU SEEN THE SIZE OF

29
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,441
OH, WHOOPING CRANES
HAVE HUGE EGGS.

30
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:52,011
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
MAKES THEM WHOOP.

31
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,914
HAS ANYBODY GOT
ANYTHING TO EAT?

32
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:56,482
MIKE, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

33
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,217
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO
BE KEEPING AN EYE
ON THAT BIRD?

34
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,721
I WAS BUT SHE FLEW AWAY ABOUT
THREE HOURS AGO AND
NEVER CAME BACK.

35
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,523
THREE HOURS, BOY,
THAT'S A LONG TIME

36
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:05,158
FOR A MOTHER TO BE
AWAY FROM THE NEST.

37
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:06,592
NOT REALLY.

38
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,830
MY MOTHER WAS AWAY FOR
TWO YEARS LESS A DAY ONCE.

39
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:13,199
WELL, WHAT IF SOMETHING
HAPPENS TO HER?

40
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:16,602
YOU KNOW WHAT,
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO GO UP ON
THAT ROOF AND CHECK THAT EGG.

41
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,805
OKAY, OKAY,
I GOT IT.

42
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:21,007
SHORT STRAW GOES, OKAY?

43
00:02:21,073 --> 00:02:23,176
NO, NO, NO, NO.
SHORT GUY GOES.

44
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:34,787
IT'S TIME FOR THE
POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

45
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:41,527
[cheering and applause]

46
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:45,865
TODAY'S WINNER WILL RECEIVE
THIS BRAND NEW CELL PHONE.

47
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,801
I ALREADY GOT A
PHONE IN MY CELL.

48
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,536
OKAY, COVER
YOUR EARS, MIKE.

49
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:53,005
RED, YOU'VE GOT 30 SECONDS
TO GET MIKE TO SAY THIS WORD.

50
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:57,310
YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
WINSTON.

51
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:58,644
AND GO!

52
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,180
ALL RIGHT, MIKE, WHEN YOU
WERE IN SCHOOL AND YOU
WROTE AN EXAM,

53
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,481
YOU WOULD EITHER
FAIL OR YOU --

54
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:05,818
CHEATED.

55
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:09,722
OKAY, THE SPACE BETWEEN TWO
MOUNTAINS, THAT'S CALLED --

56
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:13,693
CLEAVAGE?

57
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:16,929
OKAY, WHEN THE GUY IN FRONT
OF YOU IS DRIVING TOO SLOW,

58
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,664
WHAT DO YOU DO?

59
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,567
OH, SHOOT HIS TIRES.

60
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,603
OKAY, MIKE, WHEN YOU WANT TO
GO TO JAIL FOR THE WEEKEND,

61
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,905
YOU GOTTA GET A --

62
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,207
HOSTAGE.

63
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:30,209
OKAY, LET'S GO
ANOTHER WAY WITH THIS.

64
00:03:30,242 --> 00:03:33,612
LET'S SAY YOU SEE A WOMAN IN
A BAR WHO INTERESTS YOU,

65
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:34,947
YOU GO OVER TO HER
AND YOU MAKE A --

66
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,083
FOOL OF MYSELF.

67
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:39,352
ALMOST OUT OF
TIME HERE, RED.

68
00:03:39,418 --> 00:03:41,587
YEAH, UM,
ALL RIGHT, MIKE,

69
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,489
JUST TELL EVERYBODY WHERE
YOU WERE LAST NIGHT

70
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:47,727
BETWEEN THE HOURS OF
ONE AND THREE-THIRTY A.M.

71
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,363
UM, I'LL PASS.

72
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:52,298
THERE YOU GO!

73
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:55,334
[applause]

74
00:04:00,706 --> 00:04:03,075
WHEN THE AIR IN YOUR YARD
HAS A SLIGHT TINGE OF BLUE,

75
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:07,179
WHEN YOU FIND LITTLE TREES
ON THE SOLE OF YOUR SHOE,

76
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:10,015
WE'LL COME WHEN YOU CALL
'CAUSE WE LOVE WHAT WE DO.

77
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:13,319
AT ROTHSCHILD'S WE'RE PUMPED,
AND YOU SHOULD BE TOO.

78
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:20,126
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF THE VIEWERS
ASK ME WHERE I GET ALL
MY IDEAS FROM,

79
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:23,696
I WANT TO GIVE THEM AN
ANSWER BECAUSE SOMETIMES
THEY MEAN IT IN A NICE WAY.

80
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:26,398
NOW, I'M NOT ONE
OF THOSE GUYS WHO JUST
WALKS AROUND IN A VACUUM

81
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:28,968
AND COMES UP WITH THINGS
OUT OF THIN AIR.

82
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:31,570
I KNOW THAT WORKED FOR
EINSTEIN AND GALILEO,

83
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,406
BUT I GUESS THAT'S JUST
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
ME AND THEM.

84
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,609
NOW, I ALWAYS START
WITH SOMETHING

85
00:04:36,675 --> 00:04:38,277
AND THEN KINDA
TAKE IT FROM THERE.

86
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:42,147
FOR EXAMPLE, RIGHT HERE I
HAVE A 500-FOOT ROLL
OF BUTCHER PAPER.

87
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,383
YOU KNOW, THAT STUFF THEY WRAP
MEAT IN TO HIDE THE EVIDENCE

88
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,886
AFTER YOU'VE KILLED,
SKINNED AND GUTTED

89
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,221
A HARMLESS
DOMESTIC ANIMAL?

90
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:50,923
I'M JUST KIDDING YOU.

91
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,593
OKAY, FIRST THING I
DO IS TAKE A LOOK AT THE
PROPERTIES I'M WORKING WITH.

92
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,063
THIS STUFF HAS ONE SIDE THAT'S
SHINY AND KIND OF STICKY

93
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:00,933
AND THE OTHER SIDE IS
SMOOTH AND VERY SLIPPERY.

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,701
NOW I JUST TAKE A MINUTE

95
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:05,170
AND SEE WHAT MY MIND
CAN COME UP WITH.

96
00:05:06,905 --> 00:05:09,875
[laughter]

97
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,679
OH, I'M SORRY.
WHAT WAS I SAYING?

98
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:15,881
OH, RIGHT, YEAH,
THE BUTCHER PAPER.

99
00:05:15,914 --> 00:05:19,685
[harp music]

100
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:25,791
I COULD USE IT
AS A MEMO PAD,

101
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,526
WHERE YOU COULD JOT DOWN
PHONE NUMBERS OR MESSAGES

102
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,361
OR MAYBE A GROCERY LIST
WHERE YOU WRITE DOWN

103
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:31,096
WHATEVER YOU NOTICED YOU
WERE RUNNING OUT OF

104
00:05:31,163 --> 00:05:32,865
AND THEN HAVE THE
CONVENIENCE OF BEING ABLE

105
00:05:32,931 --> 00:05:34,867
TO RIP THE NOTE OFF
AND TAKE IT WITH YOU.

106
00:05:50,282 --> 00:05:54,319
OR FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO
DON'T HAVE A GARAGE --

107
00:05:54,653 --> 00:05:56,088
OH, SURE,
THOSE ARE GREAT IDEAS,

108
00:05:56,121 --> 00:05:58,257
BUT THEY'RE
JUST NOT PRACTICAL.

109
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,727
NOW, THIS IS WHERE THE
CREATIVE HANDYMAN TAKES IT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

110
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:04,263
ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S THE
WORST PART ABOUT SUMMER?

111
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:06,832
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU CAN'T GO TOBOGGANING.

112
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:10,469
THAT'S BECAUSE TOBOGGANS
WON'T SLIDE ON GRASS AND SAND.

113
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,437
THEY NEED
SOMETHING SLIPPERY,

114
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:15,707
LIKE ICE OR SNOW

115
00:06:15,774 --> 00:06:18,744
OR THE SLIPPERY SMOOTH SIDE
OF MY BUTCHER PAPER.

116
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:22,614
OKAY, YOU WANT TO
POSITION YOUR TOBOGGAN

117
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:24,416
FACING DOWN THE HILL IN
THE WAY YOU WANT TO.

118
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:26,051
BUT BEFORE YOU
GET TOO EXCITED,

119
00:06:26,118 --> 00:06:27,819
YOU WANT TO GET SOMETHING
HEAVY, SOME WEIGHT
OF SOME KIND.

120
00:06:27,886 --> 00:06:29,288
I'VE GOT A COUPLE
OF ROCKS HERE,

121
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:32,257
AND YOU WANT TO PUT THEM ON
THE END OF THE PIECE OF PAPER.

122
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:35,827
I'LL EXPLAIN WHAT THAT'S
ALL ABOUT A LITTLE LATER.

123
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:37,462
BUT THE BEAUTY NOW IS

124
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:39,932
I CAN GO TOBOGGANING
ANY TIME I WANT.

125
00:06:39,998 --> 00:06:42,568
AND IF I DO HAPPEN TO
SPLIT MY HEAD OPEN ON A ROCK

126
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:45,270
WELL, I'VE GOT PLENTY OF
PAPER TO WRAP IT UP IN.

127
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:47,472
SO REMEMBER, IF WOMEN DON'T
FIND YOU HANDSOME,

128
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:49,808
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

129
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,619
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING,
THOUGH, IT DOESN'T END HERE

130
00:07:00,652 --> 00:07:03,155
BECAUSE I'VE STILL GOT TO GET
THE TOBOGGAN BACK UP THE HILL.

131
00:07:03,188 --> 00:07:05,290
SEE THIS?
THIS IS A CORDLESS DRILL.

132
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:08,126
THIS IS OUR FRIEND.

133
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:11,196
REMEMBER THOSE ROCKS
I PUT ON THE PAPER?

134
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:13,532
NOT LOOKING SO
DUMB NOW, AM I?

135
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:24,109
[applause]

136
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:36,254
A LOT OF STRANGE THINGS
HAPPEN IN LIFE, DON'T THEY?

137
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:38,390
LIKE YESTERDAY I SAW THIS
MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE.

138
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:41,293
THEY STOPPED AT AN
INFORMATION BOOTH AND
ASKED FOR DIRECTIONS.

139
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:43,061
THE WIFE ASKED ALL
THE QUESTIONS.

140
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:46,798
THE HUSBAND JUST STOOD THERE
AND STARED AT THE PERSON
BEHIND THE COUNTER.

141
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:50,135
AND THEN WHEN THEY WERE DONE
THE WIFE TURNED AROUND,
STARED AT THE HUSBAND.

142
00:07:50,202 --> 00:07:52,737
HE TOLD HER EVERYTHING THE
INFORMATION PERSON HAD SAID,

143
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:54,239
AND THEN THEY LEFT.

144
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:56,174
SEE, THEY WERE
WORKING AS A TEAM.

145
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,943
THE WIFE WAS FOCUSED
ON THE QUESTIONS,

146
00:07:58,009 --> 00:07:59,744
PAID NO ATTENTION
TO THE ANSWERS,

147
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:01,513
THE HUSBAND ONLY HEARD
THE ANSWERS,

148
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,648
DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT
THE QUESTIONS WERE.

149
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:06,184
THAT'S BECAUSE THIS COUPLE'S
BEEN TOGETHER LONG ENOUGH

150
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:10,021
TO REALIZE MARRIAGE IS
ABOUT JOB SHARING.

151
00:08:10,055 --> 00:08:13,859
I MEAN, YOU CAN FEED, CLOTHE
AND SHELTER YOURSELF
ON YOUR OWN.

152
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:17,429
BUT ISN'T IT MORE INTERESTING
TO SHARE THAT WITH
ANOTHER PERSON?

153
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:19,731
NOT ONLY BRINGS US CLOSER
TO ZERO UNEMPLOYMENT,

154
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:23,068
IT GIVES YOU
SOMEONE ELSE TO BLAME.

155
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:25,303
LIKE, TO ME,
MARRIAGE AND JOB SHARING,

156
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,805
WELL, THAT'S A NATURAL,

157
00:08:26,872 --> 00:08:29,074
ESPECIALLY IF YOU
DECIDE TO HAVE KIDS.

158
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:33,945
CONCEPTION IS THE BEST
JOB SHARING IN THE WORLD.

159
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:38,316
IT'S GREAT WORKING CONDITIONS
AND REALLY SHORT SHIFTS.

160
00:08:38,383 --> 00:08:42,053
MOST DAYS YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE TO GO IN TO WORK.

161
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:45,657
REMEMBER I'M PULLING FOR YOU.
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

162
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:05,610
THIS A BAD TIME,
GORD?

163
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:08,446
HAVE A SEAT.
I'LL BE WITH
YOU IN AOMENT.

164
00:09:16,788 --> 00:09:19,290
OH, LOOK,
A FOREST FIRE.

165
00:09:23,862 --> 00:09:27,098
YEAH, THEY GO OUT
ON THEIR OWN.

166
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,272
THERE WE GO.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

167
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:37,075
WRITING A LETTER, GORD?

168
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:40,645
THAT'S KIND OF A PERSONAL
QUESTION, DON'T YOU THINK?

169
00:09:40,712 --> 00:09:43,348
I MEAN, WHAT IF I WAS
WRITING A LETTER?

170
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:45,483
WHAT IF I WAS
WRITING A LOVE LETTER?

171
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:49,220
WHAT IF I WAS WRITING A
LOVE LETTER TO SUSAN SARANDON?

172
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:52,357
I STILL DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S
ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS.

173
00:09:52,423 --> 00:09:55,593
HERE, COULD YOU
MAIL THIS FOR ME?

174
00:09:55,627 --> 00:09:57,462
DIDN'T YOU WRITE HER A
LOVE LETTER BEFORE?

175
00:09:57,495 --> 00:09:59,397
YEAH.
EXACTLY, YEAH.

176
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,833
DID SHE WRITE BACK?

177
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,068
REALLY?
SHE DID.
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

178
00:10:04,102 --> 00:10:06,271
OH, YEAH.

179
00:10:06,337 --> 00:10:09,607
WOW!
LETTER RIGHT THERE.
THERE'S HER

180
00:10:09,674 --> 00:10:13,978
NO, THIS IS FROM
HER LAWYER, GORD.

181
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:16,748
OKAY, THAT'S
THE WRONG LETTER, OKAY.

182
00:10:16,781 --> 00:10:19,017
YEAH.
THIS STRAIGHTENED OUT.
I MEAN, I'VE GOT ALL

183
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,985
I'VE MET ALL
THEIR CONDITIONS.

184
00:10:24,122 --> 00:10:26,958
YEAH, THERE'S HER
LETTER RIGHT THERE.

185
00:10:26,991 --> 00:10:29,761
DEAL RIGHT THERE.
THERE'S THE REAL
THIS IS IT?

186
00:10:29,794 --> 00:10:31,696
THIS IS FROM
SUSAN SARANDON?

187
00:10:31,763 --> 00:10:33,965
YES, SIR.
CAREFUL WITH THAT.

188
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:40,138
BOY, GORD,
YOU KNOW,

189
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:43,708
HER HANDWRITING IS
IDENTICAL TO YOURS.

190
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:46,744
I KNOW.
ISN'T IT GREAT?

191
00:10:46,811 --> 00:10:48,913
SHE IS SO
PERFECT FOR ME.

192
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,316
WE WRITE THE SAME.
OH, YEAH.

193
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,620
THIS IS STARTING TO
FEEL LIKE "SESAME
STREET" HERE.

194
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:57,355
IN TODAY'S EPISODE,

195
00:10:57,422 --> 00:11:00,458
BIG BIRD HAS BUILT A
NEST UP IN OUR CHIMNEY

196
00:11:00,491 --> 00:11:02,126
AND NOW BERT
AND ERNIE HERE

197
00:11:02,193 --> 00:11:04,329
ARE GOING TO GO UP
AND CHECK THE EGG.

198
00:11:04,395 --> 00:11:06,331
OH, NO, NOT ME, RED.
JUST MIKE.

199
00:11:06,397 --> 00:11:09,400
OH, THE ROOF'S IN SUCH
BAD SHAPE IT'LL ONLY
HOLD ONE OF US.

200
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:10,935
YOU THINK THAT RIG
IS SAFE, MIKE?

201
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:13,671
OH, SURE, I'LL JUST THROW
THIS ANCHOR OVER THE
PEAK OF THE ROOF

202
00:11:13,738 --> 00:11:17,175
AND TIE THE OTHER END OF
THESE BED SHEETS TO
THE DOOR OVER HERE.

203
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,444
AND I'LL PULL MYSELF UP.

204
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,279
IT'S JUST LIKE
BREAKING OUT OF PRISON

205
00:11:21,345 --> 00:11:23,347
I'VE DONE IT
100 TIMES.

206
00:11:24,282 --> 00:11:25,716
RED, COME HERE.

207
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,185
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

208
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:28,853
WHAT'S GOING ON?

209
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,621
OKAY, UM, OKAY.

210
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:32,457
WE CAN TALK TO MIKE
THROUGH THIS STOVEPIPE,

211
00:11:32,523 --> 00:11:33,958
WHICH IS CONNECTED TO THE
CHIMNEY UP ON THE ROOF.

212
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:35,359
OH, OKAY.

213
00:11:35,393 --> 00:11:37,161
WHAT'S HE GONNA DO ONCE
HE GETS TO THE NEST?

214
00:11:37,228 --> 00:11:39,630
WELL, WE DON'T KNOW
IF THAT MOTHER CRANE IS
GONNA COME BACK, RIGHT?

215
00:11:39,697 --> 00:11:42,099
SO MIKE'S GONNA HAVE TO
BRING THE EGG DOWN HERE.

216
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:44,001
OH, BOY.

217
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:47,338
[footsteps on roof]

218
00:11:47,638 --> 00:11:49,006
Mike:
CAN YOU GUYS HEAR ME?

219
00:11:49,073 --> 00:11:51,309
YEAH, YEAH.
WE HEAR YOU.
YEAH, YEAH,

220
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,145
Mike:
OKAY, I'M GOING OVER
TO THE CHIMNEY NOW.

221
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:56,347
OKAY WATCH
YOUR STEP, MIKE

222
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,416
Mike:
IT DOESN'T LOOK TOO BAD.

223
00:11:58,482 --> 00:12:01,052
[crunch!]

224
00:12:01,118 --> 00:12:02,753
MIKE,
ARE YOU OKAY?

225
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,090
Mike:
WELL, YEAH I'M FINE, BUT
MY FOOT'S STUCK IN THE HOLE.

226
00:12:06,157 --> 00:12:08,092
I CAN'T PULL IT OUT.

227
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,027
GIVE HER A GOOD YANK,
THERE, MIKE.

228
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:11,963
Mike: OKAY.

229
00:12:11,996 --> 00:12:15,032
[Mike groaning]

230
00:12:15,099 --> 00:12:17,935
Mike:
GOT IT!

231
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:20,771
[footsteps on roof]

232
00:12:20,805 --> 00:12:23,741
Mike:
OKAY, I'M AT THE NEST.
I CAN SEE THE EGG.

233
00:12:23,808 --> 00:12:25,543
IT'S HUGE!

234
00:12:25,576 --> 00:12:27,845
IT'S LIKE
MOOSE THOMPSON'S HEAD!

235
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:31,582
YEAH, EXCEPT THE EGG HAS
GOT SOMETHING IN IT.

236
00:12:31,616 --> 00:12:33,751
ANY SIGN OF
THE MOTHER CRANE?

237
00:12:33,818 --> 00:12:35,453
Mike: No.

238
00:12:35,486 --> 00:12:37,788
I GUESS YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO BRING IT DOWN, MIKE.

239
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:39,790
Mike:
OKAY, I'VE GOTTA DIG
IT OUT OF THE NEST HERE.

240
00:12:39,857 --> 00:12:41,359
GIVE ME A SECOND.

241
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:45,429
BE CAREFUL, MIKE.
WE WANT THE EGG OVER
EASY NOT SCRAMBLED, EH?

242
00:12:45,463 --> 00:12:48,232
Mike:
HEY, I GOT IT.
WHAT THE HECK IS THAT?

243
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:50,434
[brid cawing]

244
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:52,870
Mike:
OH, NO, THE MOTHER
CRANE IS BACK!

245
00:12:52,937 --> 00:12:54,538
OW! OW! OW! OW!

246
00:12:54,572 --> 00:12:56,273
SHE'S TRYING TO
PROTECT THE EGG, MIKE.

247
00:12:56,307 --> 00:12:58,142
PUT IT BACK
IN THE NEST.

248
00:12:58,209 --> 00:12:59,910
Mike:
OW! OW! SHE WON'T LET ME
GET NEAR THE NEST.

249
00:12:59,977 --> 00:13:01,712
I'VE GOT TO
TOSS IT BACK IN.

250
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,481
NO! NO! NO!
NO! NO! NO!

251
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:06,517
Mike:
OW! OW!

252
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:09,587
YOU TAKE IT.

253
00:13:09,653 --> 00:13:13,324
[Mike screaming]

254
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:17,561
RED, COME ON,
MIKE MIGHT BE HURT.

255
00:13:35,546 --> 00:13:37,948
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS,
DALTON.

256
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:41,485
YOU'RE GOING
TO BE A MOTHER.

257
00:13:41,752 --> 00:13:43,554
Red:
A BUNCH OF US WERE PLAYING A
LITTLE ROAD HOCKEY, THERE,

258
00:13:43,621 --> 00:13:45,756
AND WALTER, COMES IN ON
A BREAKAWAY AND HE
JUST FIRES ONE

259
00:13:45,823 --> 00:13:47,625
RIGHT UP, RIGHT OVER
THE WHOLE DEAL,

260
00:13:47,691 --> 00:13:49,693
AND IT GOES RIGHT DOWN
THE DARN SEWER.

261
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,295
SO NOW HOW WE GONNA --
IT'S THE ONLY PUCK WE GOT,

262
00:13:51,362 --> 00:13:53,364
AND WE GOTTA GET THE PUCK
BACK, AND AS I'M SAYING

263
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,865
WELL, WALTER, YOU DID IT.

264
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:56,667
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GET THAT OFF THERE?

265
00:13:56,734 --> 00:13:57,935
PULL THE GRATE OFF THERE.

266
00:13:58,002 --> 00:13:59,870
PULL THAT OUT,
LIFT THE --

267
00:13:59,904 --> 00:14:01,772
I'LL PULL YOU AND
YOU LIFT THE GRATE.

268
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:04,575
SO THEN DALTON HAD AN IDEA
THAT MAYBE HE COULD GET
HIS ARM DOWN THERE.

269
00:14:04,608 --> 00:14:06,410
MAYBE IT GOT CAUGHT ON
A LEDGE OR SOMETHING,

270
00:14:06,477 --> 00:14:08,579
AND THEN SOMETHING GRABBED
HIM, AND I'M THINKING
HE'S IN TROUBLE,

271
00:14:08,612 --> 00:14:10,814
BUT TURNS OUT HE'S
JUST JOKING AROUND.

272
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:12,716
THAT'S REAL FUNNY, YEAH.

273
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,218
SO DALTON BRINGS
HIS JOCK OVER,

274
00:14:14,285 --> 00:14:15,753
WHAT DID YOU BRING
YOUR JOCK FOR?

275
00:14:15,786 --> 00:14:17,955
WELL, HE SAYS,
THAT'S A PUCK MAGNET.

276
00:14:18,022 --> 00:14:21,959
AND SO HE'S GONNA DROP
THAT IN THERE AND --

277
00:14:22,026 --> 00:14:23,861
I'VE GOT ANOTHER IDEA.

278
00:14:23,928 --> 00:14:25,963
I FIGURE LET'S GO IN
SOMEWHERE ELSE

279
00:14:25,996 --> 00:14:29,266
AND THAT WAY WALTER CAN CRAWL
BACK TO THE GRATE WHERE
THE PUCK IS AND --

280
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,402
SO THEY DROP THE FISHING ROD
AND THEY COME ON OVER

281
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:33,971
I FIGURE WALTER SHOULD DO IT.
HE'S THE ONE WHO PUT IT DOWN
THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

282
00:14:34,004 --> 00:14:36,373
SO WE PULL THAT
THING UP AND --

283
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,908
WALTER DOWN YOU GO,
AWAY YOU GO.

284
00:14:37,975 --> 00:14:39,610
AWAY YOU GO.
GET IN THERE.
AWAY YOU GO.

285
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:42,379
DOWN YOU GO.
AWAY YOU GO.

286
00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:45,215
SO WALTER GOES DOWN FOR
THE PUCK AND THEN
DALTON IS HUNGRY

287
00:14:45,249 --> 00:14:47,117
HE WANTS TO GO GET --

288
00:14:47,151 --> 00:14:49,019
SO I SAY TO WALTER, WELL,
ALL RIGHT, TELL YOU WHAT,
YOU GET THE PUCK.

289
00:14:49,086 --> 00:14:50,387
WE'RE GONNA GO
GET SOME LUNCH.

290
00:14:50,454 --> 00:14:52,089
OKAY, WE'RE JUST GONNA
GO GET SOME LUNCH.

291
00:14:52,122 --> 00:14:53,791
NOW, HE'S CONCERNED THAT
A CAR MAY COME

292
00:14:53,857 --> 00:14:55,392
AND THE WHEEL MAY GO DOWN
THE HOLE AND EVERYTHING --

293
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:57,061
WELL, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.
HERE'S WHAT WE'LL DO.

294
00:14:57,127 --> 00:14:58,962
WE'LL PUT THE LID DOWN.
DON'T WORRY IT'LL BE FINE.

295
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:00,931
THERE.

296
00:15:00,998 --> 00:15:03,333
AND WE GO OFF
TO GET SOME LUNCH.

297
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:05,903
AND WHAT WE DIDN'T REALIZE IS
THAT WINSTON IS ON HIS ROUNDS

298
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:09,239
AND HE COME UP AND PARKED
RIGHT ON THE ACTUAL

299
00:15:09,306 --> 00:15:11,442
MANHOLE COVER HIMSELF.

300
00:15:11,508 --> 00:15:14,211
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER
WINSTON WAS STOPPING
FOR LUNCH.

301
00:15:14,244 --> 00:15:16,080
NO, APPARENTLY NOT.

302
00:15:16,113 --> 00:15:18,749
HE'S JUST COMING FOR A --

303
00:15:18,782 --> 00:15:21,452
HE COULDN'T FIGURE WHAT
THIS ALL WAS ABOUT,

304
00:15:21,518 --> 00:15:23,620
SO HE JUST PULLED THAT
OUT OF THERE AND --

305
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:25,289
I THINK THE PUCK WAS
IN THERE WASN'T IT?

306
00:15:25,322 --> 00:15:27,391
ANYWAY HE -- WELL, HE
DOES WHAT HE HAS TO DO

307
00:15:27,424 --> 00:15:30,727
AS PART OF --
I'M FIGURING --

308
00:15:30,761 --> 00:15:32,963
NOW BY THIS POINT
WALTER'S HAVING A TOUGH DAY.

309
00:15:37,234 --> 00:15:39,703
SO WE COME BACK -- OH,
WE REALIZE WHAT'S GOING ON,

310
00:15:39,736 --> 00:15:41,505
WE'VE GOTTA BACK
THE TRUCK OFF THERE,

311
00:15:41,538 --> 00:15:43,640
SO WE FIRE IT UP
AND BACK IT UP.

312
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:45,442
AND WINSTON CAN'T FIGURE
OUT WHAT'S GOING ON

313
00:15:45,475 --> 00:15:47,578
BUT WALTER WAS,
I'LL TELL YOU,

314
00:15:47,611 --> 00:15:51,048
IN A BIG HURRY TO GET
OUT OF THERE.

315
00:15:51,114 --> 00:15:53,650
BUT HE'S OKAY.
HE'S OKAY.

316
00:15:53,717 --> 00:15:56,286
AND, OF COURSE,
ALL I'M CONCERNED ABOUT --

317
00:15:56,353 --> 00:15:57,821
I WANNA MAKE SURE
HE GOT THE --

318
00:15:57,888 --> 00:15:59,456
DID YOU GET THE PUCK?
DID YOU GET THE PUCK, WALTER?

319
00:15:59,489 --> 00:16:01,058
THAT'S THE MAIN THING.

320
00:16:01,124 --> 00:16:02,593
NO, HE DIDN'T GET IT,
BUT WINSTON'S GOT IT

321
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:03,994
HE TOOK IT OUT OF --
WE'LL THERE WE GO --
SO WE CAN GO --

322
00:16:04,061 --> 00:16:05,596
C'MON, DALTON.
WE CAN GET BACK --

323
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:07,431
AND WINSTON,
GREAT GUY THAT HE IS,

324
00:16:07,497 --> 00:16:09,266
OFFERED TO GIVE WALTER
A RIDE HOME,

325
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:11,435
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS
REAL NICE OF HIM.

326
00:16:11,468 --> 00:16:14,137
BUT, OF COURSE, HE DIDN'T
MEAN IN THE CAB.

327
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,611
YOU GO BACK WITH
YOUR OWN KIND THERE, WALTER.

328
00:16:20,677 --> 00:16:22,879
WE'LL SEE YOU LATER.

329
00:16:31,955 --> 00:16:34,024
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT'S
PORTION OF THE SHOW

330
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:36,960
WHERE WE FEATURE THOSE THREE
LITTLE WORDS MEN FIND
SO HARD TO SAY,

331
00:16:36,994 --> 00:16:39,730
audience: I DON'T KNOW.

332
00:16:39,763 --> 00:16:41,264
THOSE ARE THE WORDS.

333
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:42,766
AND A SPECIAL
WELCOME TO HAROLD.

334
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,267
WELL, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH, WINSTON,

335
00:16:44,334 --> 00:16:46,603
I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO
SHARE THE WISDOM OF
MY ACCUMULATED YEARS.

336
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,973
YOU KNOW, THERE'S ALWAYS
CERTAIN RIGHTS OF PASSAGE
OF EVERY YOUNG MAN --

337
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,142
OKAY.
SHUT UP, HAROLD.

338
00:16:52,175 --> 00:16:53,677
YOU KNOW,
THAT WAS WRONG.

339
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,012
I SHOULDN'T
HAVE SAID THAT.
THAT WAS WRONG.

340
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,148
I APOLOGIZE.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
TOLD YOU TO SHUT UP.

341
00:16:58,181 --> 00:16:59,983
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.
SHALL I CONTINUE?

342
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,652
OKAY.
NO.

343
00:17:02,686 --> 00:17:04,821
TODAY'S LETTER
READS AS FOLLOWS...

344
00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:06,890
"DEAR EXPERTS, I WORK IN AN
OFFICE NEXT TO SOMEBODY

345
00:17:06,957 --> 00:17:09,059
"WITH A BODY ODOUR PROBLEM.

346
00:17:09,092 --> 00:17:13,163
"IS THERE SOME WAY I
CAN LET HIM KNOW ABOUT IT
WITHOUT CAUSING OFFENSE?"

347
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,132
OH, NO, JUST GET
UPWIND OF THE GUY.

348
00:17:15,198 --> 00:17:18,401
THAT'S WHAT
A BREEZE IS FOR.

349
00:17:18,468 --> 00:17:21,338
THAT'S NOT REALLY THE ADULT
WAY TO HANDLE THE PROBLEM,
YOU KNOW.

350
00:17:21,371 --> 00:17:23,607
THERE'S ALWAYS A SUBTLE,
SENSITIVE WAY TO POINT
OUT THE PROBLEM

351
00:17:23,673 --> 00:17:27,010
AND SUGGEST SOLUTIONS.
OFTENTIMES A GIFT
WOULD DO THIS.

352
00:17:27,077 --> 00:17:28,879
OH, SURE, LIKE ON
HIS BIRTHDAY

353
00:17:28,945 --> 00:17:31,414
YOU COULD GIVE
THE GUY A BATH.

354
00:17:31,481 --> 00:17:33,216
YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT'S BETTER TOO?

355
00:17:33,283 --> 00:17:35,118
YOU KNOW WHAT'S BETTER TOO?
YOU KNOW WHAT'S BETTER TOO?

356
00:17:35,151 --> 00:17:37,287
IS LIKE, AT CHRISTMAS -- AT
CHRISTMAS YOU COULD GET HIM

357
00:17:37,354 --> 00:17:39,456
AN ANONYMOUS
SECRET SANTA GIFT.

358
00:17:39,523 --> 00:17:42,058
LIKE A SECRET SANTA
SOAP ON A ROPE.

359
00:17:42,092 --> 00:17:43,927
I OFTENTIMES USE
THE SECRET SANTA APPROACH

360
00:17:43,994 --> 00:17:45,629
TO DISTRIBUTE
MY HOMEMADE FUDGE.

361
00:17:45,695 --> 00:17:47,564
THAT WAS YOU?
THAT WAS YOU?

362
00:17:47,597 --> 00:17:49,099
YES, WHY?

363
00:17:49,132 --> 00:17:51,902
YOU OWE ME A BOTTLE
OF KAOPECTATE.

364
00:17:51,935 --> 00:17:54,638
YOU OWE ME A
SET OF SEAT COVERS.

365
00:17:54,704 --> 00:17:57,874
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
ACTUALLY IN RETROSPECT

366
00:17:57,908 --> 00:17:59,309
I THINK YOU
TWO ARE RIGHT.

367
00:17:59,342 --> 00:18:01,912
WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IS TAKE
THE GENTLEMAN ASIDE
IN PRIVATE

368
00:18:01,978 --> 00:18:03,813
AND THEN POINT OUT
THE PROBLEM WHERE --

369
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,849
YOU KNOW, GIVE HIM TIME
TO FIND A SOLUTION.

370
00:18:05,915 --> 00:18:08,251
I THINK THAT'S
SOMETHING WE'VE ALL
LEARNED HERE TODAY.

371
00:18:08,318 --> 00:18:10,754
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I THINK SO TOO.

372
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,190
WINSTON, I WONDER IF I COULD
SPEAK TO YOU IN PRIVATE
AFTER THE SHOW.

373
00:18:14,257 --> 00:18:15,992
SURE.

374
00:18:16,026 --> 00:18:18,928
UNCLE RED, I'D LIKE TO
SPEAK TO YOU IN PRIVATE
AFTER THE SHOW TOO.

375
00:18:25,335 --> 00:18:27,370
DALTON, THEY WERE OUT
OF JALAPEÑO CHIPS

376
00:18:27,437 --> 00:18:30,106
SO I HAD TO GET YOU
SOUR CREAM AND ONION.

377
00:18:30,173 --> 00:18:34,144
ISN'T THAT GREAT?!

378
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:38,214
YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING FOR
THIS ENTIRE PREGNANCY.

379
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,490
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE ACTING
KINDA STRANGE, DALTON.

380
00:18:47,557 --> 00:18:51,094
I'M SORRY, RED.
I AM SO SORRY.

381
00:18:51,161 --> 00:18:53,396
THE SOUR CREAM AND ONION
CHIPS WILL BE FINE.

382
00:18:53,463 --> 00:18:54,998
I'M SORRY.

383
00:18:55,064 --> 00:18:57,534
GO GET THEM.
GO GET THEM!

384
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,172
WINSTON!

385
00:19:02,238 --> 00:19:03,640
WINSTON!

Winston:
YEP? YEP?

387
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,443
YEP?
WINSTON!

388
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:07,811
WHAT?
WINSTON!

389
00:19:07,877 --> 00:19:09,479
THIS ICE CREAM
IS TOO COLD.

390
00:19:09,546 --> 00:19:11,915
I'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL
ABOUT MY BODY TEMPERATURE.

391
00:19:11,981 --> 00:19:13,683
LOOKIT, WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE A BIRTH HERE SOON.

392
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,752
I'VE GOT MUCH BETTER
THINGS TO BE DOING

393
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:17,754
THAN WARMING UP
YOUR ICE CREAM.

394
00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:19,956
YEAH, AND I SUPPOSE I'VE GOT
NOTHING BETTER TO DO

395
00:19:19,989 --> 00:19:23,426
THAN TO SIT ON
THIS STUPID EGG!

396

OH, OH, IT'S HAPPENING!
IT'S REALLY HAPPENING!

OH, OH.

SOMEBODY BOIL
SOME WATER!

399

WE'RE NOT GOING TO
COOK THE EGG, MIKE.

400
00:19:31,568 --> 00:19:34,370
STOP SQUEEZING MY ARM
SO HARD, YOU BONEHEAD.

401
00:19:34,437 --> 00:19:36,973
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.
OH, I'M AFRAID.

402
00:19:37,006 --> 00:19:38,374
NO, I'M AFRAID
I'M AFRAID.

403
00:19:38,441 --> 00:19:40,677
OKAY, OKAY.

OH,
IT'S CRACKING!

406
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:52,622
OKAY.
GIVE THE THING A CHANCE.
WELL, GET UP, DALTON.

407
00:19:52,655 --> 00:19:55,258

410
00:20:08,938 --> 00:20:13,676
I'M GONNA TAKE HER OUTSIDE

ALL RIGHT,

418
00:20:30,793 --> 00:20:32,195
COME ON NOW.
ALL RIGHT.

419
00:20:32,261 --> 00:20:33,930
SHE WENT BACK TO
HER BIRTH MOTHER.

420
00:20:33,996 --> 00:20:35,465
YEAH, WELL,
OF COURSE SHE DID.

421
00:20:35,531 --> 00:20:37,467
BUT YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING.

422
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,269
AND DALTON, DID YOU REALLY
WANT ANOTHER DAUGHTER?

423
00:20:42,905 --> 00:20:44,907
AWAY YOU GO.
IT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT.

424
00:20:44,974 --> 00:20:47,877
YOU GO ON DOWN
TO THE MEETING.
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

425
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,479
AND IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

426
00:20:49,545 --> 00:20:51,614
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME

427
00:20:51,647 --> 00:20:53,616
AND WITH ALL THESE CRANES
FLYING AROUND HERE TODAY

428
00:20:53,683 --> 00:20:55,985
I WAS WONDERING IF MAYBE
YOU AND I MIGHT

429
00:20:56,052 --> 00:20:58,921
DO A LITTLE WHOOPING IT UP
OURSELVES TONIGHT.

430
