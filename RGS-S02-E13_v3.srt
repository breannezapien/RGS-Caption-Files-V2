1
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,909
Sure we all have worries and
troubles and things that are wrong with the

2
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:47,247
world, but it's time to put trivial things
like meaning and relevance assign.

3
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,318
It's time you join us here at Possum Lodge
for a simpler time with simpler people,

4
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:53,386
especially Dwayne.

5
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:59,792
And now it's my pleasure to introduce the
star of the show and my uncle, which nobody

6
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:02,295
can do anything about. I'm very happy to say
that much.

7
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:05,298
It gives me a comfort. Here he is, the star
of the Red Green Show Mr.

8
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:06,566
Red Green.

9
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:14,073
Carol, thank you and welcome to Possum Lodge
for those of you who have never met Harold.

10
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,075
Save yourselves while there's still time.

11
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:19,479
Harold actually controls a lot of the
technical stuff on the show here.

12
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:23,683
That's through the the magic of digital
electronics, such as the following

13
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:28,755
Harold is responsible for the look of the
show.

14
00:01:29,555 --> 00:01:31,824
I don't know who's responsible for the look
of Harold.

15
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:33,726
Maybe doofus are us.

16
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:35,795
I dress like you.

17
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,331
So we look alike. We look alike.

18
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:40,299
I better see an orthodontist

19
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,536
Gives us a lot. Look, it's cool.

20
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:47,407
Well, it leaves me cold, but not as cold as I
was last night.

21
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,810
I'll tell you. After dinner, Moose Thompson
got into one of those moods where he stands

22
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,578
in the middle of the floor and does things
with eggs.

23
00:01:53,312 --> 00:01:55,014
And after they'd all broke.

24
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,649
Well, you know, the ball started rolling.

25
00:01:56,683 --> 00:02:01,587
So on, we all ended up down at the dock
playing bobbing for surprises where everybody

26
00:02:01,587 --> 00:02:03,890
drops their pants and tries to guess the
temperature of the lake.

27
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:10,329
I'll tell you, Buster Hatfield came that
close and a bunch of us went out on the large

28
00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:13,399
party boat, which is a vessel we'd made
ourselves out of stuff as a garbage man

29
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:17,503
wouldn't take. It's kind of like a Chinese
junk without the word Chinese.

30
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:20,106
You guys are crazy to go out on that thing.

31
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:21,340
It's not seaworthy.

32
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,642
It's not even noteworthy.

33
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,481
Well, I think the problem was that where most
people fill their pontoons with air or or

34
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:33,719
styrofoam or tennis balls, our pontoons were
full of water, which apparently doesn't

35
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:34,921
float. It mixes.

36
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:36,956
I'm just saying, I figure you

37
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:41,594
Guys are very lucky that none of you drown
when that platoon of of death decided to

38
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:42,161
sink.

39
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:47,466
Yeah. Well, the non swimmers were OK because
they had the fear and the adrenaline which

40
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:52,004
allowed them to realize we were only in five
feet of water, whereas a swimmer just had

41
00:02:52,004 --> 00:02:56,209
their heads down. They were just, you know,
stroking for shore, which is not that easy.

42
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,478
When your pants pockets are full of catfish
and your flannel button holes are snagging on

43
00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:02,114
the bottom like no more floating parties,
huh?

44
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:04,450
It's a dark day for the brewery.

45
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:10,890
Anyway, we got a great show for you tonight,
so let's just get that started, Harold.

46
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:14,527
You know, we may be the only lodge in the
world that has a party submarine.

47
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:31,877
Oh, Glenn, how are things down at your
marina, your boat servicing boat, repairing

48
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:34,814
Marina, what fine?

49
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,450
I guess, I guess I didn't actually open
today.

50
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,819
I was up pricing the new RV.

51
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,189
Yep. I'm going to go into the 30 footer.

52
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,025
Yeah. Six extra feet.

53
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:48,361
Double air. Seven on wheels.

54
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:55,634
Glenn, do you remember working on our pontoon
boat this spring?

55
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,139
The lunch party. Oh, yes, sure.

56
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,974
You don't see two of those in a lifetime.

57
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,077
It's at the bottom of Possum Lake.

58
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,883
Oh, going to try to collect on the insurance
company, are we thinking, Doug?

59
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,120
No, no, we're going to collect from you.

60
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,689
Excuse me. Well, it's your fault.

61
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,358
You were supposed to fix the holes in the
pontoons.

62
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:22,228
Why do you think stinky Peterson brought it

63
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:23,062
To your marina?

64
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:24,830
Well, nobody told me that.

65
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,299
I thought it fell off the garbage scow.

66
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:32,371
I assume you remember writing you a check for
fifty dollars.

67
00:04:32,404 --> 00:04:33,906
What was that about storage?

68
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,609
Sure, I should have charged him more.

69
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:39,845
The smell coming out of that bilge was bad
for my business.

70
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:47,486
We thought you had fixed the patches in the
pontoons, but as far as I'm concerned, you're

71
00:04:47,486 --> 00:04:49,488
responsible and you're going to have to make
good on it.

72
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,658
What is he talking about?

73
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:54,560
Liability, Gleno?

74
00:04:55,628 --> 00:05:00,132
No, you see this kind of thing all the time
when I was doing paralegal work for the DA's

75
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:05,271
office. Wow, is there anything you haven't
done doc now about Tell the truth.

76
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:09,008
Okay, fine. Fine, Douglas, suit yourself.

77
00:05:09,441 --> 00:05:10,943
I was just trying to be of help here.

78
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:17,549
You know, I could prosecute this case on
real and applied liability with all the

79
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:22,855
tenants and caveats associated thereto,
which interrupted our party of the first part

80
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,690
hereafter referred to as the picnic.

81
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:28,060
But to yourself, your caveat?

82
00:05:29,194 --> 00:05:33,065
Wow, boy. A lawyer and a doctor, you must
have been school a long time.

83
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:34,533
Thirty two years, you know,

84
00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:41,006
I think waiting for a point would be a poor
investment of our time.

85
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:44,676
So why don't we try and reach an amicable
way to settle this?

86
00:05:45,577 --> 00:05:49,581
I'm pretty amicable the way it's been
settled, Douglas man.

87
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:53,719
I think Douglas is trying to say that party
boat went down was your fault and we'd like

88
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:56,121
you to pay for it. I mean, I must have some
other idea.

89
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,525
Well, yeah, sure, actually. Firstly, not my
fault.

90
00:06:01,493 --> 00:06:03,862
Secondly, you're all lucky to be alive.

91
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:09,701
And thirdly, I think we should start
thinking about a dry dock party boat a lot

92
00:06:09,701 --> 00:06:10,536
less dangerous.

93
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:11,904
Blank what?

94
00:06:12,437 --> 00:06:15,507
Oh, I don't know. How about a twenty four
foot RV, huh?

95
00:06:15,974 --> 00:06:17,409
Pretty good, right down by the water.

96
00:06:17,943 --> 00:06:20,212
Yeah, I was thinking of trading up anyway.

97
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,914
We can't afford an RV.

98
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:23,182
Oh, that's what I thought.

99
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:23,815
That's what I

100
00:06:23,815 --> 00:06:26,585
Thought. But they financed me over thirty
five years.

101
00:06:26,818 --> 00:06:27,319
All you guys

102
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:29,621
Have to do is pick up the last twenty seven
years of payments.

103
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:36,161
Well, high finance, a little over my
threshold of boredom or something you might

104
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:40,699
think about is raising the party vote up off
the bottom, you know, like like fishing for

105
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:41,366
Moby Dick?

106
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:43,869
Call me Ishmael.

107
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:48,674
I had similar sort of experience raising the
Titanic.

108
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,977
Perhaps you read the book? Yeah.

109
00:06:51,977 --> 00:06:55,247
Well, we decided we'd try to photograph the
bottom by filling it with air.

110
00:06:55,814 --> 00:06:57,449
Luckily, they had you along.

111
00:06:58,383 --> 00:06:59,885
I like the RV concept.

112
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:01,286
I'm not going

113
00:07:01,286 --> 00:07:02,321
To let it go at this, Glenn.

114
00:07:02,854 --> 00:07:04,089
You'll be hearing from our lawyer.

115
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,491
Will you be at the marina this afternoon?

116
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:08,427
Glenn didn't mean you.

117
00:07:10,562 --> 00:07:12,064
He's changing lawyers already.

118
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,398
That's a bad sign.

119
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:23,275
Late last night, there was a knock on my
door.

120
00:07:24,676 --> 00:07:29,314
It was a bunch of aliens, many of whom I'd
never seen before.

121
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:33,852
They looked like us, but they didn't ask me
for our money.

122
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,290
And that's how I knew they were aliens.

123
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:51,970
This week, Matt Varner is going to show you
how to make a Webster for Up North, designed

124
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,038
by a guy down east.

125
00:07:53,772 --> 00:07:57,909
And the first thing you need is a couple of
these vinyl plastic tablecloths.

126
00:07:58,043 --> 00:08:01,813
And the second thing you need is one of
these electric glue guns.

127
00:08:01,913 --> 00:08:07,686
I'll just plug this in if you don't, if you
don't have one of these glue guns, by golly,

128
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:09,187
they are a terrific investment.

129
00:08:10,188 --> 00:08:14,960
They say, they say, OK, I'm real hot, sticky
glue, and you can use them to caulk around a

130
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,329
window if, say, if you never wanted to open
that window again.

131
00:08:18,196 --> 00:08:22,000
Or you can do for decorating cakes, you
know, or you know, you can just take the glue

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,769
right out of there and it makes a dandy
little soldering iron.

133
00:08:26,438 --> 00:08:30,508
It's also real if you've got if you got good
handwriting, you can use them the brand

134
00:08:30,508 --> 00:08:33,879
cattle. Only downside is they take a little
while to heat up.

135
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:37,716
It's all right.

136
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:42,954
I guess it's ready. So now we just put a
glue stick in the end there and order up.

137
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:48,126
And we're ready to start gluing it just
comes real easy.

138
00:08:49,294 --> 00:08:49,928
That's what's wrong.

139
00:08:50,662 --> 00:08:51,930
Oh no, that's

140
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:55,800
That's a piece of char produced exclusively.

141
00:08:56,201 --> 00:09:01,539
There they are. They are not always happy.

142
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,444
Well, here's one. Ok, so we stick to stick
the glue stick in there, and then you just

143
00:09:06,444 --> 00:09:13,718
give it a little squeeze. And Oh, oh, oh,
all right.

144
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:15,120
Well, I'll clean that up later.

145
00:09:15,153 --> 00:09:20,158
Ok. Next thing you want to do is you want to
spread the right one of the tablecloths out

146
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:26,965
on the floor and you want to lie down on it
and trace around yourself.

147
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:33,471
Spread your arms out. This is something that
may seem a little bit awkward, but it's not

148
00:09:33,471 --> 00:09:34,272
that hard to do.

149
00:09:35,306 --> 00:09:35,774
Ok.

150
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:38,910
You just start just crazed right around.

151
00:09:40,178 --> 00:09:41,446
It should make a mark.

152
00:09:43,181 --> 00:09:44,249
Oh, that's a glow stick.

153
00:09:47,652 --> 00:09:48,253
There we go.

154
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:54,959
Scared me for a minute there, right around
yourself, and it's an unusual talent, but it

155
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,728
can come in handy if you ever get shot.

156
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:03,368
And, you know, leave her leave a little bit
extra room so that the raincoat doesn't fit

157
00:10:03,368 --> 00:10:10,708
too tight. Sorry about the view, but right
up over your head.

158
00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:14,412
And leave a space for your hands.

159
00:10:15,213 --> 00:10:15,680
You're done.

160
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:23,087
And there's basically my shape when I could,
I could stand to lose a little weight there.

161
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:28,026
Anyway, now you cut that out and then you
put that on top of the other plastic sheet

162
00:10:28,026 --> 00:10:30,562
and that becomes your form and then you've
got your raincoat on your way.

163
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:37,902
Ok, now you can just cut along the chalk
line using a pair of scissors or tin snips,

164
00:10:38,336 --> 00:10:41,239
or if everybody's borrowed, all your stuff
never brought it back.

165
00:10:41,272 --> 00:10:43,174
You may have to use some tree pruning
shears.

166
00:10:46,945 --> 00:10:49,280
All right, we're through there, and I want
you done that.

167
00:10:49,814 --> 00:10:53,651
You can start sewing the coat together with
the glue gun.

168
00:10:54,652 --> 00:10:59,223
Just be sure that you leave the bottom open
where your legs are going to stick out and

169
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:04,662
leave the ends of the sleeves open or your
hands come through and you go right up around

170
00:11:04,662 --> 00:11:07,498
the head, though. Another thing, too, is
just be careful.

171
00:11:07,498 --> 00:11:11,536
You don't glue a coat to the floor or
yourself, to the coat

172
00:11:12,036 --> 00:11:12,804
Or

173
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:17,308
The coat to say the table, or, more
importantly, that you don't glue any of your

174
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:19,911
really important body parts to the actual
glue gun.

175
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,218
I managed to find Bernie's sewing scissors,
which I'm using the cut a hole for the face.

176
00:11:30,655 --> 00:11:32,490
But now you're over code.

177
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:37,361
You know, what I've done here is I've added
a couple of accessories to kind of enhance

178
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:40,431
the look and make the functionality, is that
much more?

179
00:11:40,898 --> 00:11:45,369
I think the pieces of the inner tube I'm
using as epilepsy give it kind of a navel

180
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:50,775
look. I think we've used some cupboard
handles out of the kitchen, for sure.

181
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:54,312
A little bit. And then you've got the
sandwich bags here for pockets.

182
00:11:54,612 --> 00:11:58,816
We're going to keep your car keys fresh, and
it's kind of a kind of a unisex design.

183
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:01,853
I mean, a man or a woman could wear this and
you'd have no idea what it was.

184
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,723
And then you got the pride factor, too of
knowing that that you made this yourself.

185
00:12:05,723 --> 00:12:08,226
This is a one off to remember.

186
00:12:08,893 --> 00:12:10,228
The women don't find you handsome.

187
00:12:10,962 --> 00:12:12,563
They should at least find your handy.

188
00:12:14,432 --> 00:12:15,967
I'm sweating like a pig in this thing.

189
00:12:19,403 --> 00:12:19,870
So.

190
00:12:30,114 --> 00:12:32,283
It is spring trout season.

191
00:12:32,817 --> 00:12:37,288
You wade into the stream waist high, you
feel water, run down your legs.

192
00:12:37,488 --> 00:12:39,991
There's a hole in your hip waders, you hope.

193
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:49,800
So anyway, Douglas is pretty upset about
Glenn's lack of interest in the party boat

194
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,671
shemozzle, and when Douglas gets mad, he's
kind of like a terrier, especially with that

195
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:55,239
short hair has a nose, funny ears.

196
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,477
Now, old man Sedgwick says he thinks we
should buy the RV, but Moose Thompson says,

197
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:00,845
No, no, no, you're going to have a party
vote.

198
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:02,246
It should be a vote of some kind.

199
00:13:02,246 --> 00:13:05,916
What he wants to do is just rip the dock
right off the cribbing and lay it across 40

200
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:09,920
canoes. But then you really have to catch
moose before noon if you hope to get any

201
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,621
sense out of them.

202
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:15,192
I don't understand why you just can't have
the parties up at the lodge on terra firma as

203
00:13:15,192 --> 00:13:17,061
it were. What's the big deal about a party
boat?

204
00:13:17,461 --> 00:13:21,932
Oh, well, there's a historical significance
to to a floating celebration.

205
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:27,238
You know, it harkens back to the time of,
say, like Cleopatra or or Moses or or even

206
00:13:27,238 --> 00:13:29,039
the crew of the Exxon Valdez.

207
00:13:30,007 --> 00:13:34,044
Anyway, and Douglas is so mad at Glenn that
he's talking about taking our large boat

208
00:13:34,044 --> 00:13:35,012
business elsewhere.

209
00:13:35,646 --> 00:13:39,450
I also Glenn's got the only marine on the
lake where we're going to get our Bow Street

210
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,518
fair, the bakery.

211
00:13:41,886 --> 00:13:45,089
Don't be surprised if you see Douglas opening
a new marina right here on Possum Lake.

212
00:13:45,456 --> 00:13:47,258
Oh, that'll be great for the environment.

213
00:13:47,258 --> 00:13:48,559
More leaky gas pumps.

214
00:13:49,193 --> 00:13:50,594
Well, there's no fire hazard, Harold.

215
00:13:50,694 --> 00:13:51,929
The gas goes right into the lake.

216
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:54,098
Oh, OK, then. Oh yeah, that's perfect.

217
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:55,366
I'll go ahead. Oh.

218
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:03,107
Is this where the party boat sank?

219
00:14:03,507 --> 00:14:03,541
Not.

220
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:08,412
Yeah, see that that red, green and blue glow.

221
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:09,480
Oh yeah, yeah.

222
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,649
The Patio Lanterns are still lit down there.

223
00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:14,652
Yeah. And you can see the outline of the
boat, too.

224
00:14:14,752 --> 00:14:16,820
Yeah. And it looks like a blurry Christmas
tree.

225
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:21,792
This is great. Well, you know, small mouth
bass go crazy for bright colors.

226
00:14:21,859 --> 00:14:24,128
Oh yeah. You guys ever use a rain bowl for
bait?

227
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,065
You mean you mean a rainbow trout?

228
00:14:28,265 --> 00:14:30,301
Yeah, yeah.

229
00:14:30,668 --> 00:14:33,170
Yeah. Rainbow trout. Hey.

230
00:14:33,203 --> 00:14:34,505
Doesn't matter anyway, I guess.

231
00:14:35,205 --> 00:14:38,942
Drop anchor here, Harold and mines don't hit
none of those band instruments down there.

232
00:14:38,976 --> 00:14:42,146
All right. Well, there you go again.

233
00:14:42,146 --> 00:14:42,980
Oh, noise.

234
00:14:43,981 --> 00:14:46,150
You know, it's it's not very far down there,
doc.

235
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:47,551
We could maybe raise her up. What do you
think?

236
00:14:48,218 --> 00:14:50,320
Oh, dangerous rat. Very dangerous.

237
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,455
Yeah, yeah.

238
00:14:51,555 --> 00:14:55,225
One of us would have to go diving down
there, and there's a good chance we'd get the

239
00:14:55,225 --> 00:14:55,959
falls.

240
00:14:56,994 --> 00:14:58,629
The fall. You mean the bands on, you

241
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:00,397
Know, no, no.

242
00:15:00,397 --> 00:15:03,801
Your phones and what you get and you're
fresh one, they're far worse.

243
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:06,370
I never even heard of the full stock.

244
00:15:06,937 --> 00:15:08,138
All that happened to me.

245
00:15:08,739 --> 00:15:10,941
Oh yeah. Oh, I don't like to talk about it.

246
00:15:11,341 --> 00:15:11,942
Oh, good.

247
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:19,149
That was a number of years back when I was
leading that, that expedition to raise that

248
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:20,717
Spanish galleon off of Bermuda.

249
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:24,521
I don't remember, but you telling me you went
treasure hunt.

250
00:15:24,788 --> 00:15:26,890
Did you find the pirate treasure there?

251
00:15:27,157 --> 00:15:30,194
Well, if I did read, you think I'd be hanging
around the lodge now?

252
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:34,731
Yeah, yeah. I don't get it in Bath.

253
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:36,333
Usually love to nest in barbecue.

254
00:15:37,968 --> 00:15:39,670
What kind of I kind of treasure.

255
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,103
Where are you looking

256
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:41,438
For anything in particular?

257
00:15:41,471 --> 00:15:42,840
Oh, pirates gold. Oh yeah.

258
00:15:43,273 --> 00:15:44,675
Pieces of sixty four.

259
00:15:44,842 --> 00:15:46,643
All that pieces of eight squared.

260
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:55,419
Yeah. The Spanish treasure ship Santa St
Nicholas went off course on Lake Erie and

261
00:15:55,419 --> 00:15:56,220
sank.

262
00:15:57,187 --> 00:15:58,755
I thought you said it was Bermuda.

263
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,291
Could I not say she went off course right
now?

264
00:16:04,861 --> 00:16:05,896
Something a little special.

265
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:07,297
Sweet on eventually bill.

266
00:16:07,331 --> 00:16:10,300
We're going to go sailing. They brought the
sailing bags down there and they get the

267
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,836
sails out and get it from a wide open
feather.

268
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:18,675
Is there anyone that's not a sail bag?

269
00:16:18,675 --> 00:16:20,377
That's that's his pillow cap?

270
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:26,616
Here's a serious like primer sail bag and
starts taking the sail out there.

271
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:28,352
And you know it's folded a certain way.

272
00:16:28,352 --> 00:16:32,723
So they're all kind of comes out because
suddenly sails are they can get pretty big on

273
00:16:32,723 --> 00:16:32,956
you.

274
00:16:33,156 --> 00:16:33,557
Yeah.

275
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,696
Well, you figure it, you know, and that's the
only power for the boat song.

276
00:16:39,997 --> 00:16:43,300
You know, you're going to expect the sale to
be, you know, pretty decent, pretty decent

277
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,903
size. And probably be about a tear, I would
think.

278
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:52,776
Yeah, that'll be it. No, no, no, there's a
bit more.

279
00:16:53,377 --> 00:16:56,179
It's a pretty big, it's a pretty big sail.

280
00:16:56,179 --> 00:16:57,881
He's got there. Where are we going to get
much?

281
00:16:58,582 --> 00:17:03,920
Well, you know, golly, there's a lot of
work, all the sailing, you know, when you get

282
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,489
these big sails, all kind of rigged and
everything.

283
00:17:05,889 --> 00:17:07,290
And anyway, so now Bill is going to.

284
00:17:10,894 --> 00:17:16,133
Step one is to close the hatch, you know, OK,
he's fine.

285
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:21,571
So now this is called, I think it's called a
halyard or something hook that on itself,

286
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:23,373
what he did is he hooked it right through
his suspender.

287
00:17:23,373 --> 00:17:26,309
There's of course, none of us knew that, and
I was just I

288
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:30,113
Had my head down. I'm pulling up on it and
then I didn't, you know, it's not really my

289
00:17:30,113 --> 00:17:32,649
fault. I don't think because he told me,
just pull.

290
00:17:32,649 --> 00:17:33,450
And then I look up.

291
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,320
And of course, yes, although I can see no
problem.

292
00:17:39,956 --> 00:17:43,960
So now he's trying to rig the rig, the sail,
and it was a windy day, you know, and I

293
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,796
thing, well, this is that that thing's
moving around, and I've heard of people

294
00:17:47,998 --> 00:17:49,933
sometimes getting hit with that and what
have you.

295
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:52,936
But Bill seem to have the least.

296
00:17:53,536 --> 00:17:56,606
I thought he had it now, and I, you know, I
always assumed Bill Bill knows what he's

297
00:17:56,606 --> 00:18:01,778
doing. I I think I think that's kind of
foolish on my part.

298
00:18:04,714 --> 00:18:06,149
So by now, I had gone to.

299
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:10,654
So this is fun for me because actually I,
you know, in all the years that I've done

300
00:18:10,654 --> 00:18:12,355
most of our voting and what have you?

301
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:17,093
Even rowing the canoe and when when I had
to, I never had done any sailing.

302
00:18:17,127 --> 00:18:19,529
So this is real fun for me.

303
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:23,066
And of course, my attention was drawn
completely to the sails, and I really wasn't

304
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:25,235
noticing that I had a bit of a tow away.

305
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:42,986
So anyway, Douglas has got dark and stinky,
all hyped up about opening this Marina Stinky

306
00:18:42,986 --> 00:18:46,289
is going to pump gas and clean out the
bilgisayar, and that should eliminate all but

307
00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:47,590
the most desperate customers.

308
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:52,562
I mean, nobody browses when stinky is behind
the counter, and Moose has offered to run the

309
00:18:52,562 --> 00:18:55,999
dolphin show. But like I said, if it's
afternoon, you really have to take moose with

310
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:58,468
a grain of aspirin. Excuse me, but

311
00:18:58,468 --> 00:19:03,173
Does it not matter that Douglas nor dock nor
stinky have any marina knowledge or business

312
00:19:03,173 --> 00:19:05,308
acumen? Is that a consideration at all?

313
00:19:06,109 --> 00:19:08,511
Well, it's not really a complex situation
here, Harold.

314
00:19:08,511 --> 00:19:10,847
I mean, you just sell people stuff for more
than a cost you.

315
00:19:11,147 --> 00:19:11,948
Yes, but we won't be

316
00:19:11,948 --> 00:19:13,149
Able to get any service.

317
00:19:13,383 --> 00:19:14,551
We don't get any now.

318
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:16,186
Well, OK. All right.

319
00:19:16,186 --> 00:19:17,487
Well, what's the sense of having like

320
00:19:17,487 --> 00:19:18,688
Two useless marinas?

321
00:19:19,455 --> 00:19:20,390
At least you have a choice.

322
00:19:22,358 --> 00:19:24,327
Oh, that's the sound in the meeting.

323
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,895
We've got to go uncle. Read time to go.

324
00:19:26,863 --> 00:19:29,299
Well, this won't take long, you know, and it
doesn't.

325
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:31,968
It doesn't take men long to make a decision.

326
00:19:32,001 --> 00:19:33,570
It's making the decision look smart.

327
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,504
That takes the time.

328
00:19:40,977 --> 00:19:46,215
Oh, boy, oh boy.

329
00:19:49,252 --> 00:19:51,120
Great, great.

330
00:19:52,088 --> 00:19:52,889
All right.

331
00:19:59,562 --> 00:20:05,768
How far is Douglas Henry, Jack?

332
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:12,175
Thank you, Brad. Well, everyone, I'm
delighted to report that stinky and I are

333
00:20:12,175 --> 00:20:14,143
ready to open the Possum Lake Marina.

334
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:19,182
Now we bought a 40 foot floating dock and a
two inch monkey wrench.

335
00:20:20,983 --> 00:20:21,150
Wow.

336
00:20:25,421 --> 00:20:27,824
Well, as the as the owner of the only Marina

337
00:20:27,824 --> 00:20:32,962
In the area, I got to say that this lake
won't support two marinas, so which doesn't

338
00:20:32,962 --> 00:20:37,400
matter to me as long as you guys buy my RV
and then I can buy a new one and get out of

339
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:44,540
here. So if you'll support my proposition RV
and just vote yes, sign there.

340
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:45,942
Thanks, Michel.

341
00:20:46,008 --> 00:20:48,945
Yes, Judy. Well, I vote yes.

342
00:20:49,045 --> 00:20:54,317
We need a new dry dock party boat or, you
know, an RV is an excellent investment.

343
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:56,586
Fellas who as long as you don't drive it.

344
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:03,192
Well, luckily, we can't afford an RV because
I had the good sense to empty the Lodge

345
00:21:03,192 --> 00:21:05,061
Treasury when we purchased the floating duck
dock.

346
00:21:05,995 --> 00:21:06,629
Hey, hey guys.

347
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:10,066
Let's do it.

348
00:21:10,066 --> 00:21:14,070
Don't forget I gave him a good deal on the
rent while we needed a ranch.

349
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,738
That's well, no. Now just wait a minute.

350
00:21:15,738 --> 00:21:17,006
Just one second here.

351
00:21:17,573 --> 00:21:19,342
You spent large money on that.

352
00:21:20,243 --> 00:21:23,679
We're trying to get a new party boat, but
into the marina business, right?

353
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,849
Yeah. Right now, too late.

354
00:21:26,849 --> 00:21:28,751
Now the die is cast.

355
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:30,820
That floating dock is ours

356
00:21:32,588 --> 00:21:34,824
On paper, at least making Douglas say, I
know.

357
00:21:37,226 --> 00:21:38,361
Hold on, hold on.

358
00:21:38,594 --> 00:21:39,929
What about this, everybody?

359
00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:43,399
We scrap the whole marina idea and just take
the floating dock back.

360
00:21:45,301 --> 00:21:47,670
All right. Wait a minute, fellas.

361
00:21:48,104 --> 00:21:50,706
Randa, I bought that dog from Mary's store.

362
00:21:51,974 --> 00:21:56,646
Oh, no, no, it's changed, that's our policy.

363
00:21:57,847 --> 00:22:02,785
Ok, OK, OK, why don't we keep the floating
dock and use that as our new party boat?

364
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:11,494
Well, if we can tie it up, the Moose
Thompson that way won't let all those in

365
00:22:11,494 --> 00:22:12,795
favor of doing that. Say Hi.

366
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,398
Ok. Motion carried.

367
00:22:15,965 --> 00:22:17,500
So there's no further

368
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,401
Large business

369
00:22:19,335 --> 00:22:20,536
About a real treat for you tonight.

370
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,939
Glenn has managed to get a mint copy of a
great movie.

371
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,141
The guns in Ann Romney's

372
00:22:30,346 --> 00:22:32,648
Election, there was a bit of a problem with
the guns are have thrown.

373
00:22:32,648 --> 00:22:36,485
It was already out. But as a substitute, I
got some.

374
00:22:36,685 --> 00:22:39,188
I got some slides, some new slides that I
just got back.

375
00:22:40,256 --> 00:22:44,627
Well, I'm glad we'll be getting a new party
vote and things can get back to normal.

376
00:22:44,627 --> 00:22:46,495
Well, normal for the lodge.

377
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:49,031
It's amazing what's important as you get
older, isn't it?

378
00:22:49,965 --> 00:22:53,636
I guess it's important for large members to
be out on the water a fair bit.

379
00:22:54,103 --> 00:22:55,571
Think of us as floaters.

380
00:22:55,805 --> 00:22:58,507
That's what plumbers would call us anyway.

381
00:22:58,641 --> 00:23:02,444
My wife is watching. I'll be coming straight
home after the meeting and I'll have a bite

382
00:23:02,444 --> 00:23:05,347
of whatever you leave me on the kitchen
table and then I'll climb the stairs.

383
00:23:05,548 --> 00:23:08,317
And if there is nothing on the table, I'll
run up the stairs.

384
00:23:09,051 --> 00:23:13,389
So until next time, on behalf of myself and
Harold and the whole gang up here in Possum

385
00:23:13,389 --> 00:23:15,157
Lodge, keep your stick on the ice.

386
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:23,332
Mcgrath, but it's decided it was good for
cutting along a hill like I mentioned gravity

387
00:23:23,365 --> 00:23:25,834
there, it's good.

388
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:30,573
That's a lot. It's very dense bushland
dense, dense with grit against the road

389
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,274
running the Department of Highways.

390
00:23:32,308 --> 00:23:33,609
That's who this guy works for.

391
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:36,312
Here they only go back 30 feet from the edge
of the road.

392
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:37,846
Yeah, 30 feet.

393
00:23:37,846 --> 00:23:43,719
That's right. Oh, there we go.

394
00:23:44,086 --> 00:23:47,056
There is breakfast does not a fine look and
look at that there.

395
00:23:47,489 --> 00:23:50,826
That's that's your grilled cheese sandwich,
I think.

396
00:23:50,826 --> 00:23:52,594
Yeah. Grilled cheese sandwich with lots of
big.

397
00:23:52,861 --> 00:23:54,663
Those big thick. The real potatoes.
