MACHINE HERE, RED.

344
00:09:31,035 --> 00:09:31,703
YEP.

345
00:09:31,703 --> 00:09:32,871
WITH AUTO CRUISE ON THIS BABY,

346
00:09:32,871 --> 00:09:33,738
WE COULD GET DOWN TO THE

347
00:09:33,738 --> 00:09:36,708
GRAND CANYON IN 83 HOURS.

348
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:37,409
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, GLEN,

349
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:38,777
I JUST NEED SOME OUTBOARD MOTOR

350
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:40,111
OIL FOR THE LODGE RUNABOUT.

351
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:40,812
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

352
00:09:40,812 --> 00:09:41,546
>> RED, WE COULD BE SITTING

353
00:09:41,546 --> 00:09:42,213
IN THE GRAND CANYON

354
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:44,048
SUCKING ON MICROWAVE CHILI.

355
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:46,050
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

356
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,285
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, THE ECHO

357
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:49,220
WOULD SCARE ME TO DEATH.

358
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,221
NO, I JUST NEED

359
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:51,156
THREE QUARTS OF OIL

360
00:09:51,156 --> 00:09:52,791
FOR THE 9 1/2 WE GOT UP

361
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:53,491
AT THE LODGE.

362
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:56,327
>> YEAH, SURE.

363
00:09:56,327 --> 00:09:58,496
>> SO YOU HAVE ANY OIL, GLEN?

364
00:09:58,496 --> 00:10:00,932
>> WHY SHOULD I HELP YOU?

365
00:10:00,932 --> 00:10:02,000
>> WELL, YOU'RE THE ONLY MARINA

366
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,601
WITHIN 100 MILES.

367
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:04,702
YOU'RE A LODGE MEMBER.

368
00:10:04,702 --> 00:10:06,304
I'M A LODGE OWNER.

369
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:07,472
YOU SOLD ME THE MOTOR.

370
00:10:07,472 --> 00:10:08,806
STOP ME IF I MAKE A POINT HERE.

371
00:10:08,806 --> 00:10:09,908
>> ALL RIGHT, OKAY, SURE,

372
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:11,843
HELP YOURSELF.

373
00:10:11,843 --> 00:10:14,012
>> OH, ALL RIGHT.

374
00:10:14,012 --> 00:10:16,014
WHERE DO YOU KEEP THE OIL?

375
00:10:16,014 --> 00:10:17,982
>> UH...

376
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:37,335
[laughter]

377
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,204
>> GLEN?

378
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:42,907
>> I'M THINKING, RED.

379
00:10:42,907 --> 00:10:44,175
YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU COULD

380
00:10:44,175 --> 00:10:45,576
MICROWAVE ME A CUP OF COFFEE.

381
00:10:45,576 --> 00:10:47,478
I ALWAYS THINK BETTER WITH THAT.

382
00:10:47,478 --> 00:10:48,413
>> WHY DON'T I JUST LOOK IN

383
00:10:48,413 --> 00:10:49,314
THE--IN THE WORKSHOP HERE?

384
00:10:49,314 --> 00:10:50,415
>> OH, I THINK THE COFFEE WOULD

385
00:10:50,415 --> 00:10:52,417
BE FASTER.

386
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:54,085
>> ALL RIGHT.

387
00:10:54,085 --> 00:10:55,520
>> YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOME

388
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,688
FROZEN LAYER CAKES IN THERE.

389
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:57,355
>> YEAH?

390
00:10:57,355 --> 00:10:58,056
>> YOU KNOW, THEY GOT TONS

391
00:10:58,056 --> 00:10:58,723
OF LAYERS, JUST LIKE

392
00:10:58,723 --> 00:11:00,391
THE GRAND CANYON.

393
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:02,360
>> PROBABLY THE SAME AGE.

394
00:11:04,395 --> 00:11:07,065
TOUGHER THAN IRON

395
00:11:07,065 --> 00:11:09,300
NOT ONE OUNCE OF FAT

396
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,602
ALL SINEW AND MUSCLE

397
00:11:11,602 --> 00:11:14,939
AND BLACKER THAN BLACK

398
00:11:14,939 --> 00:11:15,973
I GUESS I BURNED

399
00:11:15,973 --> 00:11:17,475
THE STEAKS AGAIN

400
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:19,610
MMM

401
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:22,547
>> OH, GREAT.

402
00:11:22,547 --> 00:11:23,581
UNCLE RED, COME ON IN.

403
00:11:23,581 --> 00:11:24,415
GRAB A SEAT.

404
00:11:24,415 --> 00:11:25,583
I DIPPED IN THE OLD MALE BAG,

405
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,651
GRABBED A COUPLE LETTERS,

406
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:27,685
AND THEY BOTH HAVE TO DEAL

407
00:11:27,685 --> 00:11:28,786
WITH ETIQUETTE.

408
00:11:28,786 --> 00:11:31,122
>> [coughs]

409
00:11:31,122 --> 00:11:32,390
YEAH, WELL GO AHEAD.

410
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,891
>> OH, OKAY.

411
00:11:33,891 --> 00:11:34,992
WELL, FIRST ONE SAYS,

412
00:11:34,992 --> 00:11:36,227
"DEAR, RED,

WHAT DO YOU SERVE WITH RED WINE

414
00:11:37,862 --> 00:11:39,530
AND WITH WHITE WINE?"

415
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,665
>> WELL, THAT'S A LITTLE OUTSIDE

416
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:41,966
MY AREA OF EXPERTISE, HAROLD,

417
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:43,134
BUT HERE'S WHAT I DO.

418
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:44,135
I SERVE RED WINE WITH

00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:45,203
VINEGAR-FLAVORED CHIPS,

420
00:11:45,203 --> 00:11:46,571
ONION RINGS,

421

00:12:01,152 --> 00:12:02,653
>> WOW, THAT SHOULD CERTAINLY

430
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:03,487

WEDDING RECEPTION.

432
00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:06,390
[laughs]

433
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,658
WELL, WE GOT ANOTHER LETTER

434
00:12:07,658 --> 00:12:09,460
HERE, UNCLE RED, AND IT SAYS,

435
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,395
"DEAR, RED, RECENTLY I DINED

436
00:12:11,395 --> 00:12:12,730
AT A REAL FANCY RESTAURANT

437
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,831
WHERE EVERYONE HAD, LIKE,

438
00:12:13,831 --> 00:12:14,865
TWO OR THREE FORKS,

439
00:12:14,865 --> 00:12:15,766
A COUPLE OF KNIVES,

440
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:16,934
AND MORE SPOONS THAN WE HAVE

441
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:18,102
IN OUR WHOLE HOUSE.

442
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:20,938
HA! WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA?"

443
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:22,873
>> WELL, THIS HAPPENS A LOT.

444
00:12:22,873 --> 00:12:24,375
OKAY, YOU KNOW,

445
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,509
IT HAS TO DO WITH THE TYPE

446
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:26,210
OF RESTAURANT.

447
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,211
NOW, YOU MIGHT BE HAVING

448
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:28,212
A FANCY MEAL AT THE RESTAURANT.

449
00:12:28,212 --> 00:12:29,981
YOU'LL BE HAVING, LET'S SAY,

450
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:31,949
CRAB, OR STEAK ALASKA,

451
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:33,618
OR "FILETT MAGNON"--

452
00:12:33,618 --> 00:12:35,987
>> OH, NO, THAT'S FILET MIGNON.

453
00:12:35,987 --> 00:12:37,488
>> FILLY?

454
00:12:37,488 --> 00:12:38,956
WAS IT HORSE MEAT?

455
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:41,392
>> NO, IT'S FRENCH.

456
00:12:41,392 --> 00:12:42,693
>> THE FRENCH EAT HORSE,

457
00:12:42,693 --> 00:12:43,427
DON'T THEY?

458
00:12:43,427 --> 00:12:44,495
>> NO.

459
00:12:44,495 --> 00:12:45,830
THE FRENCH WORD FOR HORSE IS

460
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,398
CHAPEAU.

461
00:12:47,398 --> 00:12:49,834
>> OH, WELL ANYWAY,

462
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:51,569
THEY GIVE YOU ALL OF THESE

463
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:53,371
CUTLERY THINGS BECAUSE THEY

464
00:12:53,371 --> 00:12:55,306
HAVE A DIFFERENT PIECE OF

465
00:12:55,306 --> 00:12:56,240
CUTLERY FOR EVERY DIFFERENT

466
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,608
COURSE, BECAUSE IN A FANCY

467
00:12:57,608 --> 00:12:58,409
RESTAURANT, THE WAITER IS

468
00:12:58,409 --> 00:12:59,710
NEVER GONNA SAY,

469
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,845
"SAVE YOUR FORKS,

470
00:13:00,845 --> 00:13:02,146
'CAUSE THERE'S PIE."

471
00:13:02,146 --> 00:13:05,416
IT'S TOO, UM...

472
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,151
>> GAUCHE.

473
00:13:07,151 --> 00:13:08,419
>> WHAT?

474
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:09,387
>> IT'S FRENCH.

475
00:13:09,387 --> 00:13:10,688
THOSE FANCY RESTAURANTS USE,

476
00:13:10,688 --> 00:13:11,756
LIKE, A LOT OF FRENCH.

477
00:13:11,756 --> 00:13:13,924
YOU KNOW, LIKE PIE A LA MODE,

478
00:13:13,924 --> 00:13:16,093
AU GRATIN, MAITRE D'.

479
00:13:16,093 --> 00:13:17,261
>> YEAH, OKAY,

480
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:18,095
SO LIKE WHEN YOU'RE IN A FRENCH

481
00:13:18,095 --> 00:13:19,296
RESTAURANT AND YOU BELCH,

482
00:13:19,296 --> 00:13:20,464
YOU DON'T SAY, "EXCUSE ME."

483
00:13:20,464 --> 00:13:21,799
YOU SAY, "PARDON MY FRENCH."

484
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:23,968
>> AU GRATIN, MONSIEUR.

485
00:13:23,968 --> 00:13:24,769
>> YOU'RE STARTING TO GET ON

486
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:26,370
MY NERVES, HAROLD.

487
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,872
>> WELL, LET'S GO TO THE NEXT

488
00:13:27,872 --> 00:13:30,040
SEGMENT THEN, BY ALL MEANS.

489
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,242
>> WHERE'D ALL THIS FRENCH

490
00:13:31,242 --> 00:13:32,543
STUFF COME FROM, ANYWAY?

491
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,277
>> SCHOOL.

492
00:13:33,277 --> 00:13:35,246
>> YEAH, I MIGHT'VE KNOWN.

493
00:13:38,482 --> 00:13:40,351
IT'S ANOTHER SEGMENT OF OUR

494
00:13:40,351 --> 00:13:41,218
ADVENTURES WITH BILL,

495
00:13:41,218 --> 00:13:42,620
WHERE WE KIND OF DEAL WITH

496
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,588
SURVIVALISM, SURVIVING,

497
00:13:44,588 --> 00:13:47,458
SURVIVALISTS, STAYING ALIVE,

498
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,293
BASICALLY, AND I THINK YOU CAN

499
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:52,196
SEE WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH THIS.

500
00:13:52,196 --> 00:13:53,464
HE'S OUT OF WATER,

501
00:13:53,464 --> 00:13:54,765
AND WE'RE GONNA SHOW YOU HOW

502
00:13:54,765 --> 00:13:56,700
YOU CAN FIND WATER IN NATURE.

503
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,202
I DON'T MIND BILL DOING THESE.

504
00:13:58,202 --> 00:13:59,303
I JUST--I JUST DON'T LIKE,

505
00:13:59,303 --> 00:14:00,271
YOU KNOW, HAVING TO DO THEM

506
00:14:00,271 --> 00:14:01,438
WITH HIM.

507
00:14:01,438 --> 00:14:03,874
ANYWAY, OUT COMES HIS AX.

508
00:14:03,874 --> 00:14:05,009
BILL'S GOT HIS AX.

509
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:06,310
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU

510
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,244
MAY NOT BE AWARE OF,

511
00:14:07,244 --> 00:14:08,479
BUT IF YOU CAN CHOP A BRANCH

512
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:10,848
OFF A TREE,

513
00:14:10,848 --> 00:14:12,416
SOMETIMES YOU CAN HOOK RIGHT

514
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,184
INTO THE SAP OR THE WATERY STUFF

515
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:16,353
THAT COMES OUT THERE.

516
00:14:16,353 --> 00:14:19,523
NO, NO, NOTHING, NOTHING YET.

517
00:14:19,523 --> 00:14:20,624
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,

518
00:14:20,624 --> 00:14:21,625
"THIRD TIME LUCKY."

519
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:22,626
[water rushing]

520
00:14:22,626 --> 00:14:25,462
>> [gurgling]

521
00:14:25,462 --> 00:14:26,630
>> I DON'T KNOW QUITE WHAT

522
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,365
KIND OF A TREE THAT WAS THERE.

523
00:14:28,365 --> 00:14:29,533
ANYWAY, ANOTHER THING YOU CAN DO

524
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:31,368
IS LOW-LYING BRANCHES,

525
00:14:31,368 --> 00:14:32,670
GIVE 'EM A--AND THEY GOT--

526
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,605
WATER COMES FLYING OFF THOSE,

527
00:14:34,605 --> 00:14:36,240
OR EVEN THE HIGHER BRANCH,

528
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,007
IF YOU CAN SEE,

529
00:14:37,007 --> 00:14:38,008
YOU GET A BIG STICK NOW.

530
00:14:38,008 --> 00:14:39,376
I DON'T THINK BILL REALIZED

531
00:14:39,376 --> 00:14:41,478
THERE WAS A BEEHIVE UP THERE.

532
00:14:41,478 --> 00:14:42,780
>> [yelling]

533
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,081
>> OH, BOY, OH, BOY, OH, BOY,

534
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:47,251
OH, BOY, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH.

535
00:14:47,251 --> 00:14:49,586
OH, BOY.

536
00:14:49,586 --> 00:14:50,587
[bees buzzing]

537
00:14:50,587 --> 00:14:51,355
>> [yelling]

538
00:14:51,355 --> 00:14:52,856
>> OH, YEAH.

539
00:14:52,856 --> 00:14:53,724
THE GOOD THING WAS,

540
00:14:53,724 --> 00:14:55,459
HE WAS KEEPING THE BEES OFF ME.

541
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:57,094
AND THEN HE MADE ONE OF

542
00:14:57,094 --> 00:14:58,796
THESE LITTLE DIVINING RODS,

543
00:14:58,796 --> 00:15:00,164
OR WITCHING RODS,

544
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:00,998
OR I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU

545
00:15:00,998 --> 00:15:01,665
CALL THESE THINGS.

546
00:15:01,665 --> 00:15:03,000
IT'S ALMOST LIKE FOLK ART

547
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,168
KIND OF THING.

548
00:15:04,168 --> 00:15:06,003
THEY SAY THAT--I DON'T KNOW

549
00:15:06,003 --> 00:15:07,037
WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE EXACTLY,

550
00:15:07,037 --> 00:15:08,872
BUT THEY SAY THEY CAN FIND

551
00:15:08,872 --> 00:15:11,608
WATER, YOU KNOW, BY THE SPIRIT

552
00:15:11,608 --> 00:15:13,277
OF THE TREE OR SOMETHING.

553
00:15:13,277 --> 00:15:14,044
SO ANYWAYS, HE SAYS THERE'S

554
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:14,778
WATER RIGHT THERE,

555
00:15:14,778 --> 00:15:15,712
SO I GRABBED THE SHOVEL,

556
00:15:15,712 --> 00:15:17,414
AND WOW, I COULD HARDLY

557
00:15:17,414 --> 00:15:18,081
BELIEVE IT.

558
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:19,483
I COULD HARDLY--I DON'T KNOW.

559
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:20,517
BUT WHAT HE'D DONE IS HIT

560
00:15:20,517 --> 00:15:23,320
THE UNDERGROUND HOSE THERE.

561
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,489
BILL.

562
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:26,924
AH, WELL.

563
00:15:26,924 --> 00:15:28,091
HE MEANT WELL, I'M SURE,

564
00:15:28,091 --> 00:15:30,093
BUT WHO CARES.

565
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:31,495
NOW WE'RE JUST MOVING ALONG.

566
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:32,563
HE'S LOOKING FOR ANOTHER SPOT

567
00:15:32,563 --> 00:15:33,564
WITH WATER, AND, YOU KNOW,

568
00:15:33,564 --> 00:15:34,298
WHEN YOU'RE WALKING ALONG

569
00:15:34,298 --> 00:15:36,066
WITH BILL, IT SEEMS THAT

570
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:40,404
STRANGE THINGS HAPPEN.

571
00:15:40,404 --> 00:15:42,139
ALL RIGHT, I DON'T ASK.

572
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:43,574
IN FACT, I'D RATHER NOT KNOW

573
00:15:43,574 --> 00:15:45,676
MOST OF THE TIME.

574
00:15:45,676 --> 00:15:46,810
HE WAS MOVING THROUGH,

575
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:47,611
AND HE WAS STARTING TO GET

576
00:15:47,611 --> 00:15:48,278
SOMETHING.

577
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:49,346
HE WAS STARTING TO TWITCH

578
00:15:49,346 --> 00:15:52,015
AND SO WAS THE ROD.

579
00:15:52,015 --> 00:15:53,517
YOU KNOW, HE'S LOOKING BACK

580
00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:55,886
AND FORTH, AND HE SAID,

581
00:15:55,886 --> 00:15:56,954
"DO WHAT I DO."

582
00:15:56,954 --> 00:15:59,523
SO I TRIED DOING IT THE BEST

583
00:15:59,523 --> 00:16:01,058
I COULD, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,

584
00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:02,693
HE SEEMED TO BE CENTERING IN,

585
00:16:02,693 --> 00:16:03,694
AND, OF COURSE, GUESS WHERE

586
00:16:03,694 --> 00:16:04,628
THE WATER WAS.

587
00:16:04,628 --> 00:16:06,296
RIGHT UNDER THE ROCK.

588
00:16:06,296 --> 00:16:07,564
HE WANTS ME TO MOVE THE ROCK

589
00:16:07,564 --> 00:16:08,231
FOR HIM.

590
00:16:08,231 --> 00:16:09,066
OH, YEAH, THAT COULD HAPPEN.

591
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:10,567
SO I DECIDED TO SMASH THE ROD.

592
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:11,568
[water rushing]

593
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:13,070
[laughter]

594
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,738
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT EITHER.

595
00:16:14,738 --> 00:16:18,408
[water rushing]

596
00:16:18,408 --> 00:16:19,576
WATER WOULD BE HARD,

597
00:16:19,576 --> 00:16:20,410
WOULDN'T IT?

598
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,511
THIS IS ANOTHER TECHNIQUE.

599
00:16:21,511 --> 00:16:23,647
THIS IS REALLY TO CATCH RAIN.

600
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:25,849
YEAH, YOU STRAP A TARPAULIN

601
00:16:25,849 --> 00:16:26,783
BETWEEN A FEW TREES.

602
00:16:26,783 --> 00:16:28,618
AND IT WASN'T RAINING THIS

603
00:16:28,618 --> 00:16:29,987
PARTICULAR DAY, SO BILL

604
00:16:29,987 --> 00:16:30,854
JUST WENT TO GET A HOSE,

605
00:16:30,854 --> 00:16:32,356
AND HE'S NOT REAL GOOD WITH

606
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:33,623
THE HOSE, SO I DECIDED

607
00:16:33,623 --> 00:16:34,791
TO KIND OF TAKE OVER,

608
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:35,759
AND WE JUST PRETEND THAT IT'S

609
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,961
LIKE IT'S RAINING IN THERE.

610
00:16:37,961 --> 00:16:39,463
HE GETS HIS CANTEEN BACK, AND HE

611
00:16:39,463 --> 00:16:40,630
GOES UNDERNEATH IT,

612
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,099
AND WHAT HE DOES IS, HE WAITS

613
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:43,467
FOR THE RAIN TO BUILD UP IN

614
00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:45,135
THE TARP, WHICH WAS--

615
00:16:45,135 --> 00:16:45,802
AND YOU KNOW WATER

616
00:16:45,802 --> 00:16:46,670
IS QUITE HEAVY,

617
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,305
AND WE DIDN'T NOTICE THE

618
00:16:48,305 --> 00:16:49,339
KNOT STARTING TO SLIP OFF

619
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:50,507
ONE CORNER.

620
00:16:50,507 --> 00:16:51,308
SO THEN ALL HE HAS TO DO IS

621
00:16:51,308 --> 00:16:52,576
TAKE A LITTLE KNIFE AND JAM IT

622
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:56,246
IN THE BOTTOM, AND THEN--

623
00:16:56,246 --> 00:16:58,248
AND THEN HE GOT THE WATER.

624
00:16:58,248 --> 00:16:59,616
HE EVEN MANAGED, EVENTUALLY,

625
00:16:59,616 --> 00:17:01,384
TO GET THE CANTEEN FILLED UP.

626
00:17:01,384 --> 00:17:03,120
"IT IS SUMMER.

627
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,654
THE DAYS ARE LONG.

628
00:17:04,654 --> 00:17:07,124
RELATIVES ON VACATION COME

629
00:17:07,124 --> 00:17:08,625
TO STAY WITH YOU.

630
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,961
THE DAYS GET LONGER.

631
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:12,696
THEY BROUGHT MOM.

632
00:17:12,696 --> 00:17:14,664
INFINITY."

633
00:17:21,972 --> 00:17:23,440
>> YOU SEE, UNCLE RED,

634
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,274
IT'S NOT THAT I HAVE ANYTHING

635
00:17:24,274 --> 00:17:25,242
AGAINST HOCKEY, IT'S JUST THAT

636
00:17:25,242 --> 00:17:26,877
SOCCER IS A BETTER SPORT.

637
00:17:26,877 --> 00:17:28,478
I JUST HAPPEN TO PREFER SOCCER,

638
00:17:28,478 --> 00:17:29,312
THAT'S ALL.

639
00:17:29,312 --> 00:17:30,580
YOU KNOW, MORE KIDS ARE

640
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,882
ENROLLING IN SOCCER SCHOOL

641
00:17:31,882 --> 00:17:33,316
THAN THEY ARE IN HOCKEY SCHOOL.

642
00:17:33,316 --> 00:17:33,984
IT'S TRUE.

643
00:17:33,984 --> 00:17:35,085
BECAUSE IT'S A BETTER SPORT.

644
00:17:35,085 --> 00:17:35,919
IT'S A TREND.

645
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:36,887
IT'S A WAVE.

646
00:17:36,887 --> 00:17:37,621
THAT'S ALL.

647
00:17:37,621 --> 00:17:38,955
YOU KNOW, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

648
00:17:38,955 --> 00:17:40,991
FOR INSTANCE, IN SOCCER,

649
00:17:40,991 --> 00:17:41,958
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY THOSE

650
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,227
GREAT BIG HARD PADS THAT

651
00:17:44,227 --> 00:17:46,396
EVENTUALLY PINCH YOU, YOU KNOW?

652
00:17:46,396 --> 00:17:47,797
AND THERE'S NO ICE TO FALL DOWN

653
00:17:47,797 --> 00:17:49,132
AND CRACK YOUR SKULL ON.

654
00:17:49,132 --> 00:17:50,200
THERE'S NO BOARDS TO RAM

655
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,401
YOUR FACE INTO.

656
00:17:51,401 --> 00:17:53,470
I, FOR ONE, PREFER THAT.

657
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,071
>> SOCCER IS NOT A REAL SPORT,

658
00:17:55,071 --> 00:17:56,573
HAROLD, OKAY?

659
00:17:56,573 --> 00:17:57,607
FOR ME, FOR A REAL SPORT,

660
00:17:57,607 --> 00:17:58,642
YOU GOT TO HAVE BLOODSHED,

661
00:17:58,642 --> 00:17:59,342
YOU GOT TO HAVE SERIOUS

662
00:17:59,342 --> 00:18:00,510
PHYSICAL INJURY.

663
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:04,014
>> SOCCER HAS ALL THAT.

664
00:18:04,014 --> 00:18:06,483
UP IN THE STANDS.

665
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:07,317
>> FIGHTS?

666
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:09,386
>> OH, GANG WARS.

667
00:18:09,386 --> 00:18:10,153
>> THAT BAD, EH?

668
00:18:10,153 --> 00:18:10,820
>> OH, YEAH.

669
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,488
YOU KNOW WHAT PARENTS

670
00:18:11,488 --> 00:18:13,456
CAN BE LIKE.

671
00:18:14,257 --> 00:18:15,191
>> ANY THOUGHTS COMING TO YOU,

672
00:18:15,191 --> 00:18:16,526
GLEN, AT ALL?

673
00:18:16,526 --> 00:18:17,527
>> YEP.

674
00:18:17,527 --> 00:18:18,395
>> YOU REMEMBER WHERE YOU LEFT

675
00:18:18,395 --> 00:18:19,496
THE OIL?

676
00:18:19,496 --> 00:18:20,430
>> NO, I WAS THINKING ABOUT

677
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,599
THE GRAND CANYON, RED.

678
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:23,500
>> WELL, I THINK I'LL

679
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,300
JUST POKE AROUND.

680
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,303
SEE IF I CAN FIND IT MYSELF.

681
00:18:27,303 --> 00:18:29,139
>> MAN, OH, MAN, RED.

682
00:18:29,139 --> 00:18:29,839
JUST THINK OF IT.

683
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:31,174
THE GRAND CANYON.

684
00:18:31,174 --> 00:18:32,008
WE COULD BE SITTING IN THE

685
00:18:32,008 --> 00:18:33,043
BOTTOM OF THAT BABY LOOKING

686
00:18:33,043 --> 00:18:34,444
RIGHT UP AT ALL THAT ROCK

687
00:18:34,444 --> 00:18:36,212
AND SHALE AND STUFF.

688
00:18:36,212 --> 00:18:41,217
EVERY SEDIMENT TELLS A STORY.

689
00:18:41,217 --> 00:18:42,519
YEP.

690
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:43,219
YOU COULD LOOK AT ALL THAT

691
00:18:43,219 --> 00:18:44,821
GRAY STUFF, THAT ROCK,

692
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:46,923
AND JUST THINK THAT THEY USED

693
00:18:46,923 --> 00:18:48,525
TO BE DINOSAURS AND PREHISTORIC

694
00:18:48,525 --> 00:18:52,128
TREES AND FOLIAGE AND STUFF.

695
00:18:52,128 --> 00:18:53,329
YOU COULD REACH UP AND BUST

696
00:18:53,329 --> 00:18:56,166
A PIECE OF THAT STUFF OFF.

697
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,167
MAN, WE COULD JUST HOLD IT

698
00:18:57,167 --> 00:18:58,334
IN OUR HAND AND JUST LOOK AT IT

699
00:18:58,334 --> 00:19:01,671
AND THEN THROW IT AT EACH OTHER.

700
00:19:01,671 --> 00:19:02,772
THEN HUMMER IT INTO THE LAKE

701
00:19:02,772 --> 00:19:04,073
OR THE RIVER OR WHATEVER'S

702
00:19:04,073 --> 00:19:05,975
AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT CANYON.

703
00:19:05,975 --> 00:19:07,477
>> OKAY, GLEN.

704
00:19:07,477 --> 00:19:08,711
FOUND THE OIL I WAS LOOKING FOR,

705
00:19:08,711 --> 00:19:10,046
SO THANKS A LOT.

706
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:11,881
JUST PUT IT ON MY BILL, HUH?

707
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:13,783
>> I KNOW WHY YOU CAN'T GO, RED.

708
00:19:13,783 --> 00:19:14,951
IT'S YOUR WIFE, ISN'T IT?

709
00:19:14,951 --> 00:19:16,452
SHE WON'T LET YOU GO.

710
00:19:16,452 --> 00:19:18,188
YOU SEE, RED, I'M A FREE MAN.

711
00:19:18,188 --> 00:19:20,023
>> YEAH, RIGHT, GLEN.

712
00:19:20,023 --> 00:19:21,090
>> OH, YEAH,

713
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,759
I CAN DO ANYTHING I LIKE.

714
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:23,893
I CAN GO ANYWHERE AND COME

715
00:19:23,893 --> 00:19:24,727
AS I PLEASE.

716
00:19:24,727 --> 00:19:25,795
I'LL GO TO THE GRAND CANYON,

717
00:19:25,795 --> 00:19:26,763
RED.

718
00:19:26,763 --> 00:19:27,430
YOU JUST WAIT,

719
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:30,433
AND YOU JUST WATCH ME.

720
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:31,134
OH, BY THE WAY,

721
00:19:31,134 --> 00:19:34,137
THAT'S THE WRONG OIL.

722
00:19:34,137 --> 00:19:35,138
>> WE'LL BE BACK WITH LOTS

723
00:19:35,138 --> 00:19:35,805
MORE STUFF,

724
00:19:35,805 --> 00:19:37,073
AND LET'S NOT FORGET THE PHRASE

725
00:19:37,073 --> 00:19:38,808
"CANOE JOUSTING."

726
00:19:38,808 --> 00:19:40,143
>> LET'S NOT FORGET THE PHRASE

727
00:19:40,143 --> 00:19:42,145
"BORED OUT OF OUR TREE."

728
00:19:42,145 --> 00:19:44,113
LET'S NOT FORGET THAT EITHER.

729
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,402
>> THERE'S A GRASS FIRE

730
00:20:39,402 --> 00:20:41,137
BLAZING IN THE BACK

731
00:20:41,137 --> 00:20:42,805
OF THE HOUSE

732
00:20:42,805 --> 00:20:45,141
THE BLACK SMOKE SMELLS LIKE

733
00:20:45,141 --> 00:20:47,977
A TOASTED MOUSE

734
00:20:47,977 --> 00:20:49,345
WE DO THIS EVERY YEAR

735
00:20:49,345 --> 00:20:50,146
'CAUSE IT HELPS

736
00:20:50,146 --> 00:20:52,315
WITH THE GROWING

737
00:20:52,315 --> 00:20:53,649
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY

738
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:55,084
IT'S A HELL OF A LOT EASIER

739
00:20:55,084 --> 00:20:56,085
THAN MOWING

740
00:20:56,085 --> 00:20:57,086
[lively acoustic guitar music]

741
00:20:57,086 --> 00:20:58,921


742
00:20:58,921 --> 00:21:01,324
HI!

743
00:21:01,324 --> 00:21:02,325
>> HI.

744
00:21:02,325 --> 00:21:03,659
[laughter]

745
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:04,727
>> I KNOW A LOT OF YOU

746
00:21:04,727 --> 00:21:05,828
TEENAGERS OUT THERE ARE

747
00:21:05,828 --> 00:21:07,597
REBELLING, AND YOU DON'T

748
00:21:07,597 --> 00:21:09,031
REALLY KNOW WHY.

749
00:21:09,031 --> 00:21:10,566
MAYBE YOU'RE TORCHING SCHOOL

750
00:21:10,566 --> 00:21:11,868
BUSES OR KNOCKING OVER

751
00:21:11,868 --> 00:21:13,202
VARIETY STORES.

752
00:21:13,202 --> 00:21:15,204
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

753
00:21:15,204 --> 00:21:16,439
WHAT DOES MATTER IS THAT

754
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:17,773
THIS IS JUST A NATURAL PART

755
00:21:17,773 --> 00:21:19,909
OF THE MATURING PROCESS.

756
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:20,977
IT'S JUST YOUR WAY OF SAYING

757
00:21:20,977 --> 00:21:23,246
"HEY, I AM NOT LIKE MY PARENTS.

758
00:21:23,246 --> 00:21:24,780
I'M ME."

759
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,882
AND IF THAT MEANS TAKING A

760
00:21:25,882 --> 00:21:27,116
FLAMETHROWER TO THE MALL,

761
00:21:27,116 --> 00:21:29,085
THEN SO BE IT.

762
00:21:29,085 --> 00:21:29,986
THE IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER

763
00:21:29,986 --> 00:21:31,187
IS THAT IF YOU'RE GONNA BE

764
00:21:31,187 --> 00:21:32,955
REBELLIOUS, HAVE SOME FUN

765
00:21:32,955 --> 00:21:34,056
WITH IT.

766
00:21:34,056 --> 00:21:35,124
YOU KNOW THEY SAY THE TEENAGE

767
00:21:35,124 --> 00:21:36,325
YEARS ARE THE BEST YEARS,

768
00:21:36,325 --> 00:21:37,159
AND YOU SHOULD REMEMBER THAT

769
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:38,327
AND ENJOY THEM,

770
00:21:38,327 --> 00:21:39,495
BECAUSE YOU'RE PROBABLY

771
00:21:39,495 --> 00:21:40,296
GONNA SPEND THE REST OF YOUR

772
00:21:40,296 --> 00:21:42,265
LIFE BEHIND BARS.

773
00:21:48,771 --> 00:21:50,373
SO WHEN WE GOT DOWN TO THE

774
00:21:50,373 --> 00:21:52,008
ABSOLUTE FINAL MATCHUP IN

775
00:21:52,008 --> 00:21:54,510
THE CANOE JOUSTING COMPETITION,

776
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,244
IT TURNED OUT TO BE

777
00:21:55,244 --> 00:21:56,412
MOOSE THOMPSON AGAINST

778
00:21:56,412 --> 00:21:58,047
BUSTER HATFIELD.

779
00:21:58,047 --> 00:21:59,682
NOW, WHAT BUSTER LACKED

780
00:21:59,682 --> 00:22:01,283
IN SIZE AND SPEED,

781
00:22:01,283 --> 00:22:02,952
HE ALSO LACKED IN STRENGTH

782
00:22:02,952 --> 00:22:04,320
AND CUNNING.

783
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,488
BUT YOU KNOW HE SURPRISED US.

784
00:22:05,488 --> 00:22:06,455
BEFORE THE FIGHT BEGAN,

785
00:22:06,455 --> 00:22:07,757
WHAT BUSTER DID WAS, HE SWUNG

786
00:22:07,757 --> 00:22:09,091
HIS PADDLE RIGHT AROUND,

787
00:22:09,091 --> 00:22:10,926
AND HE CATCHES MOOSE RIGHT

788
00:22:10,926 --> 00:22:11,694
SQUARE BETWEEN THE EYES.

789
00:22:11,694 --> 00:22:12,361
YOU KNOW, AND OF COURSE,

790
00:22:12,361 --> 00:22:13,295
THIS GETS MOOSE LAUGHING,

791
00:22:13,295 --> 00:22:14,430
YOU KNOW?

792
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,564
AND THEN BUSTER UNTIES THE

793
00:22:15,564 --> 00:22:17,233
LAUNDRY AND LOOPS AN OLD PAIR

794
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:18,501
OF WORK PANTS UPSIDE DOWN

795
00:22:18,501 --> 00:22:20,036
OVER MOOSE'S HEAD.

796
00:22:20,036 --> 00:22:21,203
WELL, I MEAN, HOW IS MOOSE

797
00:22:21,203 --> 00:22:22,838
SUPPOSED TO FIGHT LOOKING OUT

798
00:22:22,838 --> 00:22:24,240
THE FLY OF A PAIR OF WORK PANTS

799
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,441
WHILE HE'S HAVING A MAJOR FIT

800
00:22:25,441 --> 00:22:26,542
OF THE GIGGLES?

801
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:27,543
SO NATURALLY, IT ENDED

802
00:22:27,543 --> 00:22:29,278
IN A DRAW.

803
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:31,347
BUT GOLLY, IT WAS A GREAT DAY,

804
00:22:31,347 --> 00:22:32,448
AND YOU KNOW, AFTER

805
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,582
WE RETURNED THE BROKEN CANOES

806
00:22:33,582 --> 00:22:35,551
TO THE SCOUT CAMP,

807
00:22:35,551 --> 00:22:36,886
WE ALL HAD OUR PICTURE TAKEN

808
00:22:36,886 --> 00:22:39,054
WITH MOOSE'S FOREHEAD LUMP.

809
00:22:39,054 --> 00:22:40,790
AND, BOY, I'LL TELL YOU,

810
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,426
A GOOD TIME WAS HAD BY SOME.

811
00:22:43,426 --> 00:22:44,827
SO ANYWAY, IF MY WIFE

812
00:22:44,827 --> 00:22:45,828
IS WATCHING, I'LL BE COMING

813
00:22:45,828 --> 00:22:46,896
STRAIGHT HOME, AND I'M BRINGING

814
00:22:46,896 --> 00:22:49,064
EVERYBODY'S LAUNDRY.

815
00:22:49,064 --> 00:22:50,065
I KNEW YOU'D UNDERSTAND.

816
00:22:50,065 --> 00:22:50,900
OKAY.

817
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,834
SO THANK YOU FOR WATCHING

818
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:52,868
THE SHOW, AND ON BEHALF

819
00:22:52,868 --> 00:22:56,539
OF MYSELF AND HAROLD

820
00:22:56,539 --> 00:22:57,339
AND THE REST OF THE GANG

821
00:22:57,339 --> 00:22:59,508
UP HERE AT THE LODGE,

822
00:22:59,508 --> 00:23:01,177
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

823
00:23:01,177 --> 00:23:04,146
[laughter, applause]
