1
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:03,870
IF YOU'RE AS FED UP SCRAPING ICE

2
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:06,639
OFF YOUR WINDSHIELD IN WINTER
AS I AM, YOU'RE PRETTY TICKED.

3
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:08,641
WE CAN PUT A MAN ON THE MOON--

4
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,643
AND DON'T GIVE ME
THAT
 EL NINO
 CRAP--

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,145
WAIT...LET ME
START AGAIN, HAROLD.

6
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:13,847
JUST EDIT THAT, EDIT THAT OUT.

7
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:16,216
IF YOU'RE AS FED UP SCRAPING ICE

8
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:18,218
OFF YOUR WINDSHIELD
IN WINTER AS I AM,

9
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,719
WELL, TRY MELTING IT OFF.

10
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,221
HOW?

11
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:23,723
JUST TOP OFF YOUR
WINDSHIELD WASHER FLUID

12
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,725
TANK WITH GASOLINE.

13
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:33,733
YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE
THE UNLEADED GAS ON THAT

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,236
BECAUSE FUMES FROM THE LEADED
GAS CAN WRECK YOUR BRAIN

15
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:38,638
AND AFFECT YOUR...SOMETHING.

16
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:45,145
AND THEN TO IGNITE THAT STUFF,
JUST USE YOUR CIGARETTE LIGHTER.

17
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:51,518
IT'S THE RED GREEN SHOW!

18
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:55,021
AND NOW HERE HE IS, THE MAN
WHO PUTS ON HIS PANTS ONE BREATH

19
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:59,059
AT A TIME, YOUR HOST AND HERO,
BUT HE'S MY UNCLE, RED GREEN.

20
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:02,295
[cheering]

21
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,834
WOW.

22
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,939
BY GOLLY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I APPRECIATE IT.

23
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,708
I DIDN'T THINK I'D GET HERE
IN TIME FOR THE SHOW.

24
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:17,444
I WAS RUNNING SO LOW ON GAS...

25
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,480
I'VE JUST BEEN RUNNING ON
FUMES IN THE POSSUM VAN.

26
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,715
HA, IF THE POSSUM
VAN JUST RAN ON FUMES,

27
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:24,584
THAT THING COULD GO FOREVER.

28
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,086
IT STINKS.

29
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:29,155
I WAS TRYING...HAROLD,
I WAS TRYING TO STOP FOR GAS.

30
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,157
I THOUGHT I'D
HAVE TIME TIME, BUT

31
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,893
I GOT BEHIND THESE CYCLISTS --
HAVE YOU SEEN THESE CYCLISTS?

32
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,662
THEY GOT THEIR
SPANDEX LONGJOHNS ON.

33
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:37,163
THEY'RE TAKING
UP THE WHOLE LANE.

34
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,731
THEY'RE DOING ABOUT 11 CLICKS.

35
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,168
SO, I JUST PLAIN
RUN OUT OF TIME.

36
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,671
DON'T PICK ON BIKE RIDERS --
WHAT THEY DO IS GOOD

37
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:46,239
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT,
FOR THEIR HEALTH.

38
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,741
NOT WITH MY ATTITUDE,
IT ISN'T, HAROLD.

39
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:51,377
CYCLISTS ARE A NUISANCE.
THEY SHOULDN'T BE ON THE ROAD.

40
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,879
WHAT? WHAT?

41
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,381
THEY CAN'T RIDE ON THE SIDEWALK.
THERE'S NO BIKE LANES.

42
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,883
WHERE ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO RIDE?

43
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,652
HOW DOES ENGLAND SOUND?

44
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,688
BIKES ARE WAY MORE
EFFICIENT THAN CARS ARE.

45
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:04,958
THEY'RE WAY MORE CHEAPER TO RUN,
AND THEY RUN A LOT FURTHER, TOO.

46
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:06,693
ALL RIGHT, WHY
DON'T YOU PUT

47
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,962
YOUR MONEY WHERE
YOUR MOUTH IS?

48
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:10,763
OR DO YOU HAVE
THAT MUCH MONEY?

49
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,536
I'LL BET YOU.

50
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,037
ALL RIGHT.

51
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:20,273
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS GOOD
BECAUSE THE POSSUM VAN

52
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,041
RIGHT NOW IS
COMPLETELY EMPTY OF GAS.

53
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:23,710
SO, THAT'S A GOOD START, OK?

54
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,713
SO, WHAT WE'LL DO IS...
WE HAVE $10 EACH TO SPEND, OK?

55
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,214
OK.

56
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,716
I'LL TAKE THE POSSUM VAN,

57
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,451
YOU GET ON YOUR
TRICYCLE, ALL RIGHT?

58
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:35,522
AND WE'LL SEE WHO GOES
FARTHEST IN A 24-HOUR PERIOD.

59
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,357
OK, YEAH, DEAL.
DEAL.

60
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,125
HA, HA.
CAN YOU
LEND ME $10.

61
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,728
YEAH, SURE...NO!

62
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:43,229
GET OUT, NO!

63
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,797
ALL RIGHT.

64
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,606
TIME TO PLAY THE
POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME.

65
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,042
AND TONIGHT'S SPECIAL
GUEST IS MR. MIKE HAMAR.

66
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:01,848
YEAH, MIKE WILL BE PLAYING
FOR A SPECIAL PRIZE OF

67
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,683
5 POUNDS OF CHOPPED BEEF.

68
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,185
YEAH, SUPPLIED BY
WALLY'S BUTCHER SHOP.

69
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,187
AND WALLY HAS INCLUDED
A LITTLE NOTE, HERE.

70
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:10,190
IT READS: "IF YOU COME ACROSS
A FINGER, YOU CAN KEEP IT."

71
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:13,193
"BUT HE WOULD LIKE
THE RING BACK." OH, BOY.

72
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,198
WHOA, OK.

73
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,200
UNCLE RED YOU HAVE
30 SECONDS TO GET

74
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:23,203
MR. MIKE HAMAR TO SAY THIS WORD:

75
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,206
"SHOPPING."

76
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,707
"SHOPPING."

77
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,209
YEAH, ALL
RIGHT, HAROLD.

78
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:30,710
GO!

79
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,445
YOU NEED SOMETHING
SO, YOU GO DOWN

80
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:33,947
TO THE STORE
AND YOU GO...

81
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,748
CASE THE JOINT?

82
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:39,719
NO, NO, OK, YOU GO IN,
YOU PICK UP WHAT YOU WANT,

83
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,422
YOU GO TO THE CASH REGISTER --
NOW, YOU ARE...

84
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:43,990
RUNNING?

85
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,927
YOU KNOW, UH, WHEN YOU
SEE PEOPLE IN THE MALL,

86
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,496
THEY GOT THEIR ARMS FULL
OF PURCHASES -- THEY ARE...

87
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,065
MARKS.

88
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,001
LET'S GO A DIFFERENT WAY, MIKE.

89
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,502
YOU KNOW THOSE CARTS IN FRONT

90
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,238
OF GROCERY STORES --
YOU'VE SEEN THEM

91
00:03:58,304 --> 00:03:59,739
IN THE RACKS -- WHAT ARE THEY?

92
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,241
MOBILE HOMES?

93
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,512
OK, THIS IS SOMETHING
PEOPLE SEE AS FUN.

94
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,748
THEY GO INTO A MALL,
AND THEY GO...

95
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,283
PANHANDLING?

96
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,453
OK, OK, BUT ONCE YOU'VE
PANHANDLED FOR A WHILE,

97
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,688
YOU TAKE THE MONEY,
YOU GO INTO THE MALL

98
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,423
AND YOU MAKE A PURCHASE.
YOU ARE...

99
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,925
IN A LIQUOR STORE?

100
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,794
ALMOST OUT OF TIME, UNCLE RED.

101
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,663
OK, MIKE.
STORES, OK?

102
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,199
YOU'RE NOT BROWSING, YOU'RE
NOT PANDHANDLING, YOU'RE NOT

103
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,568
SHOPLIFTING, YOU'RE NOT
CASING THE JOINT, YOU ARE...

104
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,703
IN CUSTODY?

105
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,139
YEAH, BUT...YOU KNOW WHAT I DO,

106
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,141
UH, MR. GREEN,
I JUST SAY, "HEY, OFFICER,"

107
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,410
"I WASN'T DOING NOTHING WRONG,
I WAS JUST SHOPPING."

108
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:38,911
[bell ringing]

109
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,514
YEAH, ALL RIGHT!

110
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,024
HA, HA, I'VE GONE 100 KILOMETRES
ON MY 10 BUCKS WORTH

111
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,860
OF GAS, AND THE POSSUM VAN
IS JUST STARTING TO SPUTTER NOW.

112
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:56,262
I FIGURE I'VE GOT HAROLD BEAT

113
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,865
EIGHT WAYS TO
SUNDAY ON THIS ONE.

114
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,074
YOU ALL RIGHT?

115
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,843
YOU KNOW, I THINK
YOU'RE SUPPOSED

116
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,846
TO LEAVE THE SEAT
ON THE BICYCLE.

117
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:18,051
HOW FAR HAVE YOU
GONE, ANYWAY?
UM, 117
KILOMETRES.

118
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:19,519
WHAT?
UH-HUH, HA.

119
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:23,156
YES, AND I HAVEN'T
EVEN SPENT MY $10 YET.

120
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,991
YOU STILL GOT ALL THE MONEY?

121
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,560
YEAH, YEAH, THEY
RAN OUT OF LINIMENT.

122
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,329
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

123
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,864
WELL, I'M GETTING THERE.
I'M DOING FINE.

124
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,633
I'M JUST WARMING UP,
ACTUALLY, HAROLD.

125
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,868
AND DON'T FORGET, WE
STILL GOT TWO HOURS LEFT,

126
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,603
AND I'M NOT OUT OF GAS.

127
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,105
WELL, I
PRETTY MUCH AM.

128
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,341
YEAH, I THINK MAYBE YOU ARE.
YOU KNOW, HAROLD,

129
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:42,875
I WAS THINKING MAYBE WE SHOULD

130
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,111
HAVE A PRIZE OF SOME
KIND FOR THIS CONTEST.

131
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,612
YEAH, OK, YEAH.

132
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,781
IF I WIN, I'D LIKE A TROPHY.

133
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,017
OK, ALL RIGHT, AND,
IF I WIN, WELL, UM...

134
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,452
WE'LL EXCHANGE
VEHICLES FOR A DAY.

135
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,888
HA, HA, I'LL GET THE POSSUM VAN,
AND YOU'LL GET THE BIKE.

136
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:57,657
WELL, HEY, THAT'S
FINE WITH ME, HAROLD,

137
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,026
BECAUSE IT WILL
NEVER EVER HAPPEN.

138
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:03,363
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE A TROPHY TO WIN.

139
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:18,444
IF YOU FIND YOURSELF
AT THE GATES OF HEAVEN 

140
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:22,148
AND THERE DOESN'T
SEEM TO BE ANYONE AROUND 

141
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:26,486
IT'S PROBABLY JUST A FINAL
TEST TO SEE IF YOU'RE PATIENT 

142
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:30,390
SO, DON'T JUST WALK
IN AND SIT DOWN 

143
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,961
YOU KNOW, WOMEN NEVER
GET TIRED OF HEARING

144
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,829
MEN SAY THOSE
THREE LITTLE WORDS:

145
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,298
"I'LL MAKE DINNER."

146
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:42,301
ESPECIALLY IF THE KIDS HAVE BEEN
WAILING AND FIGHTING ALL DAY,

147
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,737
AND THE DOG'S TRYING TO
FIREPROOF THE FURNITURE.

148
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:48,608
SO, TODAY, ON HANDYMAN CORNER,
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A RECIPE

149
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:53,713
TO MAKE A BEAUTIFUL POSSUM
LODGE FIRE ENGINE CHILI.

150
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,249
YOU KNOW ALL CHILIES PRETTY
MUCH HAVE THE SAME INGREDIENTS.

151
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:58,117
SO, THAT'S NOT
REALLY THE SECRET.

152
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,319
THE SECRET...

153
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:06,159
IS TO MAKE EVERYTHING
IN BIG BATCHES.

154
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:10,163
YOU KNOW, IT'S A LOT CHEAPER,
AND YOU GET LEFTOVERS, WHICH IS

155
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,265
REAL HANDY WHEN YOU GET
RELATIVES DROPPING OVER

156
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:15,201
UNEXPECTEDLY, AND YOU WANT TO
SERVE THEM SOMETHING THAT WILL

157
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,103
CONVINCE THEM
THEY SHOULD REALLY LEAVE.

158
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,141
I'M GOING TO NEED A BIGGER POT.

159
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:25,511
YOU KNOW, THE BEAUTY OF THIS
RECIPE...IF YOU MAKE ENOUGH,

160
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:28,514
YOU CAN ACTUALLY MOVE
THE WHOLE PROJECT OUTSIDE

161
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,450
WHERE YOU'LL BE MORE COMFORTABLE

162
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:33,453
WITH YOUR SURROUNDINGS
AND YOUR EQUIPMENT.

163
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,022
YEAH, JUST FIRE
THAT UP ON THERE.

164
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,924
THERE WE GO.

165
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,492
GET THAT IN.

166
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,160
NOW, FOR THE ONIONS.

167
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,229
OH, NO, NO, NO, WAIT A MINUTE.

168
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,797
SAFETY FIRST, EH?

169
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,799
IT'S BAD ENOUGH THE
GUYS SEE YOU'RE COOKING.

170
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:50,470
YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO
SEE THAT YOU'RE CRYING TOO.

171
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:55,041
ONCE YOU'VE GOT
ALL THE STUFF IN THERE,

172
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:56,542
JUST LET HER SIMMER SO THE

173
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,044
INGREDIENTS CAN
MARRY EACH OTHER.

174
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,046
DON'T TRY AND TALK
THEM OUT OF IT.

175
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,647
YOU DIDN'T LISTEN;
NEITHER WILL THEY.

176
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,657
OH, THIS IS GOING
TO BE A GOOD BATCH.

177
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,893
NOW, YOU KNOW THERE'S
A WIDE VARIETY OF SEASONINGS

178
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,896
YOU CAN USE IN YOUR CHILI,
JUST TO YOUR OWN PERSONAL TASTE.

179
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,899
BUT I ALWAYS LIKE TO START
WITH THE RED HOT CHILI POWDER.

180
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:23,269
THIS IS CALLED CHILI, HUH?

181
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,271
HA, HA.

182
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,006
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S GOOD.
NOW, WHAT ELSE?

183
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,774
LET'S SEE...

184
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,512
AH, WE'LL PUT A LITTLE
MORE CHILI IN THERE.

185
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,780
OK, WHAT ELSE DO WE GOT?

186
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,383
WELL, WHAT THE HECK.

187
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,785
IT IS CALLED CHILI...OH,

188
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,354
OH!

189
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,289
I'M NOT GOING IN THERE.

190
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,891
THAT'S FIBRE.

191
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:48,494
ALL RIGHT, NOW FOR MY SECRET

192
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:51,163
INGREDIENT, HUH -- KEROSENE.

193
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,066
OH, I..I KNOW YOU'RE...
THAT'S POISON, RIGHT?

194
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,536
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THE POISON PART BURNS OFF.

195
00:08:56,602 --> 00:09:00,673
I'M PRETTY SURE -- AND IT GIVES
THE CHILI A REAL KICK TO IT.

196
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,876
BESIDES, A LITTLE BIT OF
KEROSENE IN A BATCH THIS SIZE

197
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,444
ISN'T GOING TO HURT ANYBODY.

198
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,750
WELL, IT ISN'T GOING
TO HURT EVERYBODY.

199
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,387
REMEMBER NOW,

200
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,255
PRESENTATION IS EVERYTHING.

201
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,758
SO I SUGGEST YOU SERVE
THE CHILI IN A BOWL

202
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:21,294
RATHER THAN A BUNCH OF YOU
STANDING IN A CIRCLE

203
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,329
EATING IT STRAIGHT
OUT OF THE POT.

204
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,698
OH, MAN.

205
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,134
YOUR WIFE'S GOING TO
LOVE YOU FOR THIS, EH?

206
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,338
NOTHING SAYS MY HEART BURNS
FOR YOU LIKE POSSUM LODGE CHILI.

207
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:41,013
ALL RIGHT, I THINK, NEXT TIME
ON HANDYMAN CORNER, I'M GOING

208
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,283
TO SHOW YOU HOW TO TURN
A SHOP VAC INTO A STOMACH PUMP.

209
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:49,589
UNTIL THEN, REMEMBER: IF THE
WOMEN DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

210
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,658
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

211
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,964
ANYBODY WANT ANY CHILI?

212
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,234
TO GO?

213
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:10,076
I WANT TO TAKE
A FEW MINUTES TO SHOW

214
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,611
YOU MIDDLE-AGED GUYS SOMETHING.

215
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:14,313
WHEN YOU GET TOO OLD
TO MEMORIZE THE EYE CHART,

216
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,815
IT'S A LEAD-PIPE CINCH YOU'RE

217
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:18,317
GOING TO BE ISSUED
A PAIR OF THESE.

218
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:21,821
THESE ARE CALLED EYEGLASSES
AND THEY ARE GIVEN TO PEOPLE

219
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,824
LIKE US SO WE WON'T BE
A SAFETY HAZARD

220
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,325
TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC.

221
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,327
REMEMBER, A LONG TIME AGO,

222
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,197
YOU SAID YOU'D DO IT
TILL YOU NEED GLASSES?

223
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,469
WELL, GUESS WHAT?

224
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,073
THAT TIME HAS COME.

225
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,775
SO, OFF YOU GO WITH YOUR

226
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,777
PRESCRIPTION DOWN TO
THE OPTICIAN, THERE.

227
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,679
AND BESIDES THE FACT
THAT YOU NEED GLASSES

228
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,347
TO SEE HOW YOU LOOK IN GLASSES,

229
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:51,150
YOU'RE GOING TO GO CRAZY
TRYING TO FIND A PAIR

230
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,185
THAT DON'T MAKE YOU
LOOK LIKE A GEEK.

231
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,988
WELL, I CAN SAVE YOU
A LITTLE BIT OF TIME, THERE.

232
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,391
ALL GLASSES MAKE
YOU LOOK LIKE A GEEK.

233
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:01,794
HERE'S THE GOOD PART:
ONCE YOU'RE OUT OF THE STORE,

234
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,295
IT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM BECAUSE

235
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,665
YOU'RE ON THE INSIDE
LOOKING OUT.

236
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,367
SO, IF YOU NEED
GLASSES, GET THEM.

237
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,804
REMEMBER WHAT DOROTHY PARKER
SAID, "MEN WHO NEED GLASSES"

238
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:16,442
"SOMETIMES MAKE PASSES AT WOMEN
WHO ARE ALREADY THEIR WIVES."

239
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,312
HEY, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

240
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,881
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

241
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,155
OH, OH, OH, MAN.

242
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:32,858
I'M SO SMART MY BRAIN
SHOULD BE REGISTERED

243
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:36,395
IN THAT PLACE, YOU KNOW...

244
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:39,165
YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE THAT,
THEY HAVE THAT PLACE

245
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,434
WHERE THEY HAVE THE THINGS.

246
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,971
I HAD ENOUGH GAS TO GET
TO THE TOP OF ROCK REEF POINT.

247
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,807
AND THEN WHEN
THE POSSUM VAN STALLED,

248
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,543
I TURNED HER AROUND AND
I COASTED ALL THE WAY DOWN.

249
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,011
NEVER WENT NEAR THE BRAKES.

250
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,747
I MEAN, IT WAS A HAIRY RIDE,
BUT I ADDED ANOTHER

251
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,749
37 KILOMETRES TO MY TOTAL.

252
00:11:56,816 --> 00:12:00,252
I'M GOING TO BEAT
HAROLD SO BAD, HA, HA, HA.

253
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,027
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

254
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,762
ROCK REEF POINT.

255
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,497
HERE'S YOUR
BACK BUMPER.

256
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,972
YOU WERE ON YOUR BICYCLE,
HANGING ONTO MY BACK BUMPER?

257
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,007
WHOO!

258
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,344
THAT'S CHEATING, BUDDY.

259
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,079
OH, NO, NO, NO,
IT'S NOT CHEATING.

260
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,982
I WAS...WHAT I WAS DOING
WAS NOT WHAT--

261
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,884
I WAS MONITORING YOU CHEATING.

262
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,154
NO, NO, NO, YOU
SLOWED ME DOWN.

263
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,655
I WANT CREDIT
FOR THAT.

264
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:39,158
NO, WE LANDED ON THE BOTTOM
SIMULTANEOUSLY, SO THAT STILL

265
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,727
GIVES ME MY 17-MILE LEAD;
THEREFORE, YOU OWE ME

266
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,462
THE POSSUM VAN KEYS
S'IL VOUS PLAIT.

267
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,501
[laughing]

268
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,571
TREAT HER
NICE, HAROLD.

269
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,573
OK, AND HERE'S
THE KEY TO MY BIKE.

270
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,709
THAT'S FOR THE SADDLE BAG.

271
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,879
THERE'S A SANDWICH IN THERE,
YOU CAN HAVE THAT.

272
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,947
THIS WILL BE A REAL
ADJUSTMENT FOR YOU.

273
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,450
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ON TWO WHEELS
IN A LONG TIME.

274
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,552
EVERY TIME I TURN A CORNER.

275
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,791
WELL, WELCOME
TO THE MEN ANONYMOUS.

276
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:14,794
AS ALWAYS I'D LIKE TO ASK
MY UNCLE RED TO COME UP

277
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,429
AND LEAD US IN THE MEN
ANONYMOUS PLEDGE...UNCLE RED.

278
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:23,903
I'M A MAN, BUT I CAN CHANGE
IF I HAVE TO, I GUESS.

279
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,373
THANK YOU.

280
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,110
WHOO.

281
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,611
ALL RIGHTY.

282
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:35,614
NOW, JUST TO REMIND YOU,
HERE AT MEN ANON, UH, YOU KNOW,

283
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,616
THERE WILL BE NO NAMES,
NO LAST NAMES,

284
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,118
NO MIDDLE NAMES,
NO NICKNAMES, NOTHING.

285
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,120
PRIVACY IS THE UTMOST,
ALL RIGHTY?

286
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,856
OK, TONIGHT'S GUEST SPEAKER,
MR. WINSTON ROTHSCHILD. WINSTON?

287
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,129
HI, GUYS.

288
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,697
HI, MR. ROTHSCHILD.

289
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,601
AS MOST OF YOU KNOW,

290
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,337
I HAVE A SEWAGE
AND SEPTIC SUCKING BUSINESS.

291
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:02,474
OUR MOTTO IS, "WE MAKE SURE
BYGONES ARE BYGONES."

292
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,278
BUT I HAD A REAL BREAKTHROUGH
LAST WEEK, GUYS.

293
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,014
I WAS ON A FLIGHT FROM
PORT ASBESTOS TO HOGAN'S HUMP,

294
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,116
I HAD A YOUNG LADY
SITTING BESIDE ME.

295
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,618
NOW,

296
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,554
ORDINARILY,
WHEN I MEET A STRANGER,

297
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:19,158
ESPECIALLY A LADY, I JUST
GO ON AND ON AND ON

298
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,327
ABOUT MY LINE OF WORK, EH?

299
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,863
'CAUSE I FIND MY CAREER
SO FASCINATING.

300
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:27,166
AND I USUALLY HAVE
A FEW HUMOROUS ANECDOTES

301
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:30,236
ABOUT THE SEPTIC SUCKING
BUSINESS AS A WHOLE.

302
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,173
WHICH REMINDS ME,
HAVE I TOLD YOU THE ONE

303
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,508
ABOUT THE BOOT, YOU KNOW,
UP THE TUBE THERE?

304
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,043
WITH THE SHREDDING
AND...YOU KNOW,

305
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,779
AND THE PRESSURE PIPE COMES
DOWN AND SUCKS THE BOOT UP...

306
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,748
IT GOES UP THERE,
JUST A FLAPPING AWAY

307
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:45,284
LIKE...LIKE THAT..

308
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,254
BUT ANYWAY, THE POINT IS

309
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,756
I MANAGED TO GO
THE ENTIRE FLIGHT

310
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,259
WITHOUT TALKING
ABOUT MY BUSINESS...

311
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:57,429
WHICH, AS YOU KNOW,
IS OTHER PEOPLE'S BUSINESS.

312
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,265
NO, SIREE, I, I...

313
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,100
I ASKED HER QUESTIONS
ABOUT HERSELF.

314
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,569
AND I GAVE HER SOME
HELPFUL HINTS

315
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,304
IN THE EVENT OF A PLANE CRASH.

316
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,439
OH, IT WAS HARD,
BUT I'LL TELL YOU,

317
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:12,044
NOT ONCE DID I EVEN MENTION
THE CONCEPT OF SEWAGE,

318
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,680
EVEN WHEN THEY
BROUGHT US OUR MEALS.

319
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,448
ALL RIGHT. CONGRATULATIONS.

320
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:19,451
[ RED ]: THAT FELLA'S TRYING
TO GET AN AXE OUT OF A STUMP.

321
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,186
GIVE HER A GOOD YANK
THERE, BILL.

322
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,289
OH, WELL, LATER MAYBE.

323
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:24,790
OH, HI, RED,
HOW YOU DOING?

324
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,292
I TOLD YOU, LATER.

325
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,494
ALL RIGHT, WHAT ARE WE DOING?

326
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,764
UH-OH, I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN
HE PUTS HIS HANDS IN HIS PANTS.

327
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,500
BETTER THAN HIM PUTTING
HIS HANDS IN MY PANTS, I GUESS.

328
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,001
WATCH OUT, EASY, EASY, OH!

329
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:39,171
WATCH THE KNOTS, HA, HA, HA.

330
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:42,408
OH, BOY, THAT'S A LOT OF ROPE
FOR AN OLDER GENTLEMAN.

331
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,910
WHAT DID YOU--
WHAT DO YOU GOT IN MIND HERE?

332
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,912
OK, I'LL TAKE--
WHAT ARE WE DOING, BILL?

333
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,414
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

334
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,182
OH, OH, OH!

335
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:54,186
I DON'T THINK I COMPLETELY
UNDERSTAND OR ENJOY THE GAME,

336
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,921
BUT THANKS FOR-- WHAT? WHAT?

337
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,756
OH, A TUG OF WAR.

338
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,491
OH, YOU WANT A TUG OF WAR.

339
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,493
ALL RIGHT, AWAY YOU GO,
YOU GO OFF.

340
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,495
YOU GO THAT WAY,
YOU GO THAT WAY.

341
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,097
DON'T LOOK BACK, ALL RIGHT?

342
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:07,232
HEH, HEH, HEH.

343
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,234
I GOT A LITTLE PLAN
I'M WORKING ON.

344
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,236
HEH, HEH, HEH,
JUST A LITTLE HELPER

345
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,738
FOR MY END OF THE ROPE.

346
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,107
HEH, HEH, HEH, OH, BOY.

347
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,775
JUST TAKE A LITTLE EXTRA SLACK.

348
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,511
IT CAN GO AROUND THE CAR --
EVEN A K-CAR, I THINK,

349
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,046
WOULD BE BETTER
THAN MOST HUMANS.

350
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:24,316
GO ROUND THERE
AND CHUCK THAT UNDER...

351
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:25,818
AND WHAT I CAN DO--

352
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,554
OH, OH, OH, OH, MY.

353
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,791
TIE HER OFF AT THE DOOR HANDLE
THERE, AND WE'RE ALL SET.

354
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,927
I THINK I'M
GOING TO DO WELL HERE.

355
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,996
GET RID OF THE PAIL.

356
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,131
OW!

357
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,632
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE.

358
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,435
ALL RIGHT, BILL,
I'M ALL SET, I'M ALL SET.

359
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,105
PULL AWAY, I'M ALL SET,
I'M READY, LET HER GO.

360
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,639
YEAH, LET HER GO.

361
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,441
GIVE HER A YANK. OH, YEAH.

362
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,378
OH, OH, BOY, OH,

363
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:56,115
OH, OH, OH, OHHH, OH, OH!

364
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,616
CHANGE THE GRIP.

365
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,818
OH, OH...

366
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,325
HI, HAROLD,
HOW YOU DOING?

367
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:09,528
HAROLD, HE WANTS YOU--

368
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:13,198
NO, NO, NO, NO.

369
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,900
HI, HAROLD.

370
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,569
LOOK AT THIS. OH, BOY!

371
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,273
BRING IT ON, BRING IT ON.

372
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,643
HEY, HEY, TAKE IT EASY GUYS,
GUYS, TAKE IT EASY.

373
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,781
TAKE IT EASY NOW, TAKE IT EASY,
GUYS, TAKE IT EASY.

374
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:30,816
TAKE IT EASY, COME ON NOW.

375
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,384
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

376
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,522
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

377
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:39,191
OH, OH!

378
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,326
OH, OH!

379
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,729
OHHH!

380
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,798
YOU WANT FRIES WITH THAT?

381
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,633
THE WINDOW
WAS OPEN.

382
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:55,774
HI, I'M RANGER GORD,
I'M MOTHER NATURE'S BEST FRIEND.

383
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,144
BUT I'M ACTUALLY
HOPING THAT ONE DAY

384
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,346
WE CAN BE MORE
THAN JUST FRIENDS.

385
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,486
I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE
RED'S ASKED ME TO DO

386
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,822
A SCIENTIFIC
DEMONSTRATION FOR YOU.

387
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,558
I'M HERE TO RID THE WORLD
OF AN OLD WIVE'S TALE.

388
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,560
YOU KNOW, IF THERE'S
ONE THING I KNOW

389
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:18,397
EVERYTHING THERE IS
TO KNOW ABOUT, IT'S ABOUT...

390
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,299
OH, YEAH, FACTS

391
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:21,800
ON FIRE.

392
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:24,837
I'M SURE RED AND HAROLD
CAN BACK ME UP ON THAT ONE.

393
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:30,342
YOU KNOW...YOU DON'T SPEND 18
YEARS UP IN A FIRE WATCHTOWER

394
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,944
WITHOUT LEARNING ONE THING.

395
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,013
AND WHATEVER THAT ONE THING IS
THAT YOU'VE LEARNED...

396
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,252
IT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT TO CLING TO.

397
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,790
ANYWAY, WE'VE ALL HEARD
THE EXPRESSION

398
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,325
"FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE."

399
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:50,796
WELL, I'M HERE TODAY TO TELL YOU
THAT THAT DOES NOT WORK...OK?

400
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:55,901
ALL YOU GET WHEN YOU FIGHT FIRE
WITH FIRE IS EXTRA FIRE. NOW...

401
00:18:58,036 --> 00:18:59,471
TO PROVE THIS POINT...

402
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:00,973
OH, BOY.

403
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,708
I'LL SET THIS SIGN ON FIRE...OK?

404
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,443
THEN I'M GOING TO
FIGHT THIS FIRE

405
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,944
BY USING THIS FLAME-THROWER.

406
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,446
NO, UH, GORD,
GORD, GORD...

407
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:08,947
YOU CAN'T-- NO, YOU CAN'T HAVE

408
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,449
A FIRE GOING ON THE TABLE.

409
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,017
NO FIRE, NO.

410
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:17,823
OK, WELL, THEN HAROLD
CAN HOLD THE SIGN...

411
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,324
[shrieking]

412
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:21,560
NO, GORD, NO.

413
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,329
I GOT AN IDEA...I GOT AN IDEA.

414
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:26,665
WHY DON'T YOU PROVE
THAT YOU CAN'T FIGHT FIRE

415
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,134
WITH FIRE WITH FIRE WITH FIRE?

416
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:33,739
OHH...OK, I GOT YOU. ALL RIGHT.

417
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,240
REALLY?

418
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:36,742
YEP -- OK, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

419
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,744
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY
NOT GOING TO WORK OUT,

420
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,613
BUT I WANT TO RID THE WORLD
OF ANOTHER OUTDOORSMAN MYTH.

421
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,684
THE ODDS OF KILLING TWO BIRDS
WITH ONE STONE IS ASTRONOMICAL.

422
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,353
OK? ONE STONE PER BIRD, PEOPLE.

423
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,589
ONE STONE PER BIRD. THANK YOU.

424
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,367
OH, YEAH.

425
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,236
YEAH.

426
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:09,875
YEAH, JUST CRUISING
THE STREETS OF POSSUM LAKE.

427

THE OLD VAN-MEISTER AND ME

00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:23,522
IT WAS GREAT, WOW...

00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,157
WONDER HOW UNCLE RED'S DOING ON

433
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,892
THE BIKE -- HE'S
BEEN GONE FOREVER.

434
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,628
I SHOULD HAVE LEFT THE MONSTER
WHEEL TRAINING WHEELS ON IT.

435
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,163
[horn honking]

436
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,664
OH, EXCUSE ME.

437
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,403
WHAT? HEY!

438
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,573
YOU CAN'T BE IN HERE WITH THAT.

00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,075
THAT'S NOT A-- DON'T

440
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,010
YOU'RE GOING TO HIT THE BEAR.

441
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:48,380
UNCLE RED!

442
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:53,252
I LOVE IT, HAROLD,
I LOVE IT...HUH?

443
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:54,753
NO.

444
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,688
NO, THAT'S NOT-- NO.
DON'T EVEN DO THAT.

445
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,991
DON'T ENCOURAGE HIM --
THAT'S NOT MY

BIKE.

447
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,861
IT'S A BIKE, HAROLD, UH?

448
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,063
IT'S A TWO-WHEELER.
THAT WAS THE DEAL.

449
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,565
NO, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE, LIKE,

GETTING IN SHAPE
AND PROTECTING THE OZONE.

451
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,103
HAROLD, THIS THING GETS ABOUT
A THOUSAND MILES TO THE GALLON.

452
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,605
YOU ARE MISSING
THE POINT.

453
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,275
I DON'T LIKE POINTS.

454
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:19,911
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE
I'LL JUST KEEP THE POSSUM VAN.

455
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,880
MAYBE I'LL JUST
RUN OVER YOUR FOOT.

COMING TO GET YOU SOON.

YOU WON'T GET
ME BACK HERE.
