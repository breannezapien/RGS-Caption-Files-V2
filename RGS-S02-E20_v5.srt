1
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:49,249
It's time to head north up to the unspoiled
wetlands and unpolluted air of places like

2
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,017
this where people don't seem to want to go.

3
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,786
But we're up here on your behalf.

4
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:57,090
Beam me back an action packed, fun filled
show for you to appreciate, even though the

5
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,391
ratings suggest otherwise.

6
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:03,229
And here's the probable cause for all that
the star of the Red Green Show and a close

7
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,731
personal uncle of mine.

8
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,299
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr.

9
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:06,833
Red

10
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:11,104
Green, Oh, thank you and

11
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:12,539
Welcome to Possum Lodge.

12
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:14,307
I don't want to take all the credit for the
show.

13
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,976
Harold's got to share the blame for at least
his part.

14
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:22,082
I guess you're talking about my state of the
art visual effects, what

15
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,418
I think make a little break from content I
always say.

16
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:28,988
Actually had a little problem up at the
Lodge this week.

17
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:31,925
You know, we like to we like to think of
this as virgin territory.

18
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:36,496
Nothing personal, Harold. But, you know,
sometimes civilization kind of encroaches

19
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,631
here and messes things up, and we got to do
some cleanup.

20
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:43,203
Like, for example, it might have to replant
some trees that we've driven over or replace

21
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:44,437
the topsoil in the den.

22
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,941
Or sometimes on a Saturday, we'll just
shovel the empties off the beach.

23
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:50,510
Remember that time we had the Big Oil spill?

24
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:52,645
Yeah. Well, that's why we make stinky
Peterson.

25
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,581
Wear a bathing cap now, right?

26
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:58,318
Yeah, we have had some environmental
problems in the past.

27
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:01,821
We used to get a lot of gas leaks up here,
and then we realized that the propane tanks

28
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:02,889
are left hand thread.

29
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:07,894
After that, we could actually tighten the
coupling rather than just wrap it in the duct

30
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:12,899
tape. Once we started doing that, the
campfires got a lot more controllable and

31
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,802
managed to bring the forest fire level down
down a peg or two.

32
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:20,173
And then pretty soon the geese and the loon
started coming back and nesting on the lake

33
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:21,374
again, and we could go out hunting.

34
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,843
So what's the big emergency this week, Uncle
Ray?

35
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,380
Well, we're getting a lot of build up of foam
on Possum Lake,

36
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,483
A little bit of foam. It's of no consequence.

37
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,051
Yeah, OK, I agree.

38
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:34,654
But this is this is real thick foam here and
you can't see the lake.

39
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,989
You can't see the dock, you can't see the
canoes.

40
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:41,728
I was out there this morning and a motorboat
and boys ever tough whipping around when you

41
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:46,332
can't see the dock or other boats or rafts
or the shore or barbecues or people

42
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,467
sunbathing on the beach.

43
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,672
I thought I heard screaming, Yeah, well,
anyway, we either have a pollution problem

44
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:56,776
here or Possum Lake is rabid anyway, but I'm
going to show there, Harold.

45
00:02:56,776 --> 00:03:04,517
Oh, yeah, right? How you guys doing inside?

46
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,255
How can you justify being in a lodge in such
a beautiful day?

47
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,925
Oh, it's a glorious day for a game of golf.

48
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,027
There's no snow. There's no lightning.

49
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:17,363
I'd be up for another 18 if anybody's
interested, huh?

50
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,699
Aren't you supposed to be working today,
Bob?

51
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:27,707
I'm working, Eddie, but I'm I'm in here on
ministry business.

52
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,411
Yeah, any idea what this is?

53
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:33,813
Well, it's too clean to be a cookie.

54
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:40,653
Exactly. I was on the 12th hole and I
ducked, hooked a three wood and a lake.

55
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:43,223
Of course, it was on purpose, but it is a
joke.

56
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:48,528
You are. You got it. So naturally, I didn't
count the stroke, but when I reached in and I

57
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:53,766
fished this out, I looked at it very closely
and I noticed how clean this ball really is

58
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:58,037
when I went to the end of Possum Lake and I
saw that it was covered in foam.

59
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:01,608
Oh yeah, well, that's probably just, you
know, the white caps from the waves.

60
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:04,811
You know, sometimes it gets like that, you
know, the white cap and they eat like that.

61
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:12,051
That could happen. No, this stuff is six
feet deep pink and smells like old fat, ugly

62
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:16,122
foam from some form of low grade detergent
or something like that.

63
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,192
You wouldn't know anything about that, would
you?

64
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,161
Eddie, what kind of cheap shot is that, Bob?

65
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,164
Are you saying my food makes toxic suds?

66
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:28,034
Or are you going to make a joke about me
washing my hair in the lake?

67
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,005
That's a good joke.

68
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,706
You were thinking, of course.

69
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,511
You know, some people might laugh at that,
you know, because humor is such a subjective

70
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:45,952
thing, isn't it? You know, wait, I'm going
to go read about the subjective humor element

71
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:51,090
of it all. Awesome.

72
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,325
Eddie Fife.

73
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:56,062
I find that sticky froth on Possum Lake is
coming from your kitchen.

74
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:59,465
Well, I'm just going to have to inspect it
on behalf of the department.

75
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,467
No, that's my job.

76
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:06,139
You know, Bob, there's been something I've
wanted to tell you for a long time.

77
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,741
You're a crappy golfer.

78
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,480
That's it. I'm going to appoint you to the
ministry.

79
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:19,152
And if I don't get you under on the suds
thing, I'm going to get you on your meatloaf.

80
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:20,887
There's nothing wrong with my meatloaf.

81
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,489
Oh, come on now, Eddie. Don't say things you
don't mean

82
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:25,925
To off time right now.

83
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,293
I reply you right now.

84
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,265
Why does he do that to me?

85
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,133
He knows I hate confrontation.

86
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,803
I'm an artist. I wear my heart on my sleeve.

87
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:39,872
How are you enjoying the cookies?

88
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,874
No, I have an eating disorder.

89
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:49,082
This could cure it. I want to get that bill.

90
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:50,316
That would be Noel.

91
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,510
You don't ask for a passport.

92
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,312
You like just anybody in here.

93
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:23,349
Well, I heard somebody having trouble opening
an unlocked door.

94
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:24,751
That's pretty sure to you.

95
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:26,819
That matters. Not Mr.

96
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:28,688
Poor security is what you've got here.

97
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,323
No, I'm sorry. I had to come down on you
like that.

98
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:31,524
But that's my responsibility.

99
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,093
Which reminds me I've got a report.

100
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:40,733
I just completed an exhaustive surveillance
of the lake and surrounds, and I'm happy to

101
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,769
report everything is called normal.

102
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,238
Well, what about the six feet of foam down
south?

103
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,673
And I miss that.

104
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:56,749
It's a call for a redo. Starship entry one
16 Area of surveillance incomplete.

105
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,518
Reconnoiter ASAP.

106
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,587
Don't you worry, red, I'll find it.

107
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,723
I did think of the source.

108
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,025
I'll be sure to wash your hands before it's.

109
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:12,298
Now, water, you want to take some cookies
with you.

110
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,635
Oh, yeah, thanks. I wouldn't want to go out
there on the arm.

111
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:28,681
About the lodge, where the men like to play,
there's new guys and wedges at all times a

112
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:36,155
day, booby trapped cow flap, short sheeting,
beds that don't play out run

113
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,890
The bullets measure professional.

114
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,200
As we've done gone the handymen

115
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,204
Corner, we're going to show you how to turn a
negative into a positive and I don't just

116
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,072
mean hiring him as a producer director.

117
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:57,877
I'm talking about the frustrations of what
happens when your lawnmower meets your garden

118
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,580
hose. We've all experienced this.

119
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:01,881
Some of us, more than others, you know?

120
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:06,452
I've never been involved with any high level
management meetings, but if I'd have been

121
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:10,323
there when they were designing the garden
hose and realizing it was going to lie on the

122
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,792
lawn, then it was going to be a lawn mower
going by.

123
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:16,195
I'm not sure I would have picked Green, you
know, as the ideal color.

124
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,567
I'm just a consumer in that carries its own
responsibilities, but rather than just throw

125
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:25,771
all these little slats into the lake or what
have you, I'm going to show you today how you

126
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:29,375
can create some interesting alternatives of
using these things.

127
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:33,045
I wasn't the first one, for example, is a
little bit obvious, but this would be your

128
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:36,983
high volume, long range drinking straw for
those unfortunate times when you're at a

129
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:40,286
party or what have you. And for whatever
reason, you just can't pick up your beverage

130
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:43,089
or you can't afford another one, but he's
got one, that kind of thing.

131
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,926
You know something else? Sound travels and
straight lines.

132
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:50,096
People don't know that it won't go around
corners, so you can't hear what they're

133
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,564
saying about you and headed down the hall.

134
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:54,367
You have an ear trumpet like this with a
flexible hose on it.

135
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,701
Like this? You stand there.

136
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,737
You put this into your ear and you put the
other end.

137
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,675
Well, sound travels underwater.

138
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:06,779
Real good, too. So that's another that's
another bonus you ever notice when you pick

139
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:10,850
up a paint can and the handle can just rip
right through your skin and just take the

140
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,884
bone right off the air if you're not
careful.

141
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:16,255
You take a little piece of your hose and you
split it up lengthwise.

142
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:20,293
You put that through the handle and look at
just goes on there.

143
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,295
No problem. And you pick it up and.

144
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:28,534
Well, of course, the first thing that you
can do with your with your hose couplings is

145
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:32,204
you can actually recreate the whole hose
just by putting the pieces together, except

146
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:35,374
it'll be about three feet shorter because
you've got to cut up one of the pieces for

147
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:40,212
washers. And another thing to do, which I
think is darn attractive, is your own

148
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,414
personal bike lock.

149
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:46,552
You know, you would probably want to have a
bike worth locking, for starters, to wrap

150
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:52,491
this around here, and you would taking that
up real good use a vise grips or a wrench or,

151
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:56,162
you know, a pipe wrench, whatever you have
on there, because nobody can steal your bike

152
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,931
that way, I must, I must. They have pliers
and criminals just don't don't think I had

153
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:03,936
like that. I think the best application of
this is what I'm wearing right here.

154
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,306
You see this, you catching this, you're
getting this on camera and these are

155
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:10,543
suspenders. They go down through my belt
loops and up and over with the cufflinks

156
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:14,113
attached and everything. And the beauty of
these is in the winter, you can fill them on

157
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,415
some sort of a hearty soup, you know, to
keep you warm.

158
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:21,554
I would suggest a cream of mushroom or
possibly even a beef, barley or soup deserve.

159
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:22,588
You just want to fly by the seat of your
pants.

160
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,924
And I think these are dandy.

161
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,426
And you know, I'm even thinking of patenting
these.

162
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,430
I'm going to call them pantyhose anyway
until the next time.

163
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,201
Remember, if the women don't find you
handsome, they should at least find your

164
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:39,372
handy, friendly pair.

165
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:57,857
Typekit. It is a winter animals lie in a
deep sleep hidden away from air and light in

166
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,158
a place called the Senate.

167
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:09,702
And so, anyway, Bob's been accusing Eddie of
polluting the lake with his cooking and that

168
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:12,872
he doesn't take criticism well, even with
all the practice he's had.

169
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:13,472
I'm sorry,

170
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,709
Excuse me, but nor asked me to tell you to
drop by his place.

171
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,210
Ok, so I told you so there.

172
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,846
What does he want, Harold Power?

173
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,948
I think you mean now?

174
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,684
I'm sorry. I have. I have no idea.

175
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:26,485
Well, that would have been my guess.

176
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,822
Funny when people choose to be defensive
about, isn't it?

177
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:34,226
I mean, Eddie with his cooking and mouse
with his weight and Bob with his golfing.

178
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:39,632
And you, Harold, you with your complexion
and your teeth and your eyesight and the way

179
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:43,436
you walk and the way you talk and your hair
and your school marks.

180
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:44,804
Ok, thank you very much.

181
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:48,808
Thank you. I was wondering, you know, did Bob
ever find out what those pink bubbles were?

182
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,210
I mean, you know, he works for the Ministry
of the Environment.

183
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,745
I think pink bubbles were pretty much fall
into

184
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,413
The government jurisdiction, wouldn't it?

185
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:55,815
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, it does.

186
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,984
Actually, what he did was he sent Bill out
in a canoe right into the phone, and Bill

187
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,153
just disappeared, never seen from since.

188
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:05,458
So then Bob teed up some balls and started
just driving golf balls into the fall.

189
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:09,195
I think he was testing the texture or the
cohesiveness or something.

190
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:12,164
He hasn't learned anything, but he has
located Bill's head twice.

191
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,135
Well, that's important, too. Ok, well, we
should get on with the show actually now.

192
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:19,105
Yeah, yeah. Ok, I'll just go see what Noel's
got on his mind.

193
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:19,939
Shouldn't take long.

194
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:35,221
Now, I'm this close to a discovery of
breakthrough on the frothy foam case.

195
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,156
You mean the suds on the leash?

196
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,360
You have almost no muscle tone at all.

197
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:46,532
J Lo, I don't know where you find the energy
to pull your pants up.

198
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:48,434
Well, the suspenders help

199
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:54,507
I give it. Want my God, grant?

200
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:55,207
Yeah.

201
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,243
Congratulations. And I kick your tires.

202
00:12:57,243 --> 00:13:02,248
Now I can bench press two hundred and fifty
pounds three sets of 12.

203
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:04,383
Boom, boom, boom.

204
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,419
That's something you do for work. Or is that
like a party piece?

205
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,588
Something I do for life?

206
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,023
Well, I'm tough, right?

207
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,125
Physically, mentally.

208
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,227
Kind of like Chuck Norris,

209
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,129
A guy I love connection.

210
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:23,235
I pity you read one of these days you're
going to wake up dead and you won't know what

211
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,137
hit you. That's why I got to solve this
sudsy.

212
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:31,010
Like Kate said, I am this close to
discovering the purpose of purpose.

213
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:33,846
Tick tock. Ok.

214
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:42,121
I observe some suspicious activity.

215
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:48,093
Yeah, some around the large Cedar Prefab
Cottage down on the far end of possum like

216
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,130
that is a beautiful Scottish center hall
plan.

217
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,933
Three oversized bedrooms and that living
room.

218
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,568
You can play handball in it anyway.

219
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:02,541
On the evening, prior to the mysterious
appearance of that diaphanous detergent

220
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:09,215
residue that crap on the lake, I was engaged
in some security surveillance on the main

221
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,983
road. Yeah, I was in the ditch.

222
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:17,089
Oh yeah, I observed a truck approaching,
said Cottage at one 15, three twenty seven

223
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:22,561
and then later on. Yeah, I can't really be
exact on that time because three twenty seven

224
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,363
a truck ran over my watch.

225
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:28,200
Oh yeah, I can tell you that the vehicle had
studded tires.

226
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,435
Yeah, oh yeah. Sure.

227
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:32,037
Yeah, with that tire tread, I can run a
trace on those.

228
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,740
Yeah, yeah, well, it's a lot.

229
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,478
With the appearance of the fall.

230
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:45,184
The very next day, I think we can come to
the conclusion that those people are

231
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:51,123
responsible for releasing illegal and toxic
chemicals into the lake or they're running

232
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,691
some sort of carpet cleaning business.

233
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,493
I'm not sure we're still at the theory
stage.

234
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,529
Yeah. All right.

235
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,532
Well, I'll tell you what. Oh, why don't you
go up there and check that out?

236
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:04,703
Because that way you won't be here talking
to me, and you won't be able to get an

237
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,538
imprint of their front grille, maybe on your
forehead.

238
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,642
I need back. Yeah, I'm going to head up there
now.

239
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:12,678
Ok. Listen, read don't you

240
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:16,248
Jog or something? Well, maybe after lunch,
I'll see you

241
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,683
In bed for. Yeah.

242
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:22,054
Oh, right. Yeah, I probably wouldn't tell
anybody about this.

243
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,189
Oh, don't worry.

244
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:35,668
This is hockey night in Canada.

245
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:43,609
Bill and I went down to Bob's Marina, took a
bucket full of pucks and built out of skates

246
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,146
on there. They're kind of weak ankles, which
actually extend right up to the top of his

247
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:51,183
tooth, and we're going to do a little bit of
hockey practice and bills.

248
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:57,656
It looks like Bill spent most of his career
on the bench or under the bench.

249
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:03,162
It is basically a goaltender, so he is going
to get in that there and literally in that.

250
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:10,436
And he's all right, well, he's got all the
patty, he's got the stick and he's got their

251
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:15,975
gloves, and now I've never seen anybody put
on padding before, but this didn't strike me

252
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:21,080
at the end of balance on his skates, and I
thought, why don't we put him on the ice and

253
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,015
just kind of nail into them, you know?

254
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:28,020
But you know, when you're trying to think of
a system that'll work, it's tough to do with

255
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:34,059
Bill. But eventually he got everything on
there and I went out around the blue line and

256
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,863
had all the pucks and sort of sort of spread
them out, put them in line.

257
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,999
And the idea is I'm going to start firing
shots at them.

258
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,433
I can really whip that people.

259
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:48,807
They save. And then he got himself regrouped,
and I just said, Now I'm going to mix up the

260
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:53,045
shots to slap her and a wrist shot and an
overhand slider and, you know, kind of

261
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:55,047
sideways submarine curve shot.

262
00:16:55,881 --> 00:17:01,053
And by golly, I started getting lucky their
catch in the top corner and putting a few

263
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,221
into the five hole or.

264
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,156
It's four point eight metric.

265
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,359
Oh, sorry, sorry, Bill.

266
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:11,797
So Bill said, hold everything he says he
wants to try a different approach and he

267
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:15,100
really he felt the padding was what was
holding them back.

268
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,004
So this very strange starts taking all the
padding off, just throwing her down on the

269
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:22,741
ice there. And I didn't know how far he was
going to go with this, you know, going down

270
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,209
to the bare skiff on the ice or whatever.

271
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,813
But now we just got rid of all the padding
and figured he'd be more mobile.

272
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:32,184
And of course, now I'm motivated to really
rip the puck in there is just that's fun.

273
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,218
That's fun for me. That's fun.

274
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,887
I call that fun. Call me crazy.

275
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,188
And I rip around, Darren.

276
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:37,756
Here we go. Nice.

277
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:40,092
Save Floyd. He's right.

278
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:43,429
He's going, Oh yes, I don't think that was
going in anyway to me.

279
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,465
Oh, that feels great.

280
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:49,234
Look at this. Look at this and you got it.

281
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:56,075
It was really good. Look, you got a really
relative, beautiful work.

282
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,876
Build beautiful. And.

283
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:10,956
Well, I don't know, I think this Possum Lake
foam thing was just part of a natural cycle

284
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:15,260
freezing, thawing, rising, falling, coming
over with pink foam.

285
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:19,932
I remember one time we had thousands of
splinters of wood, naga hide and plastic out

286
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,066
there that turned out to be nothing.

287
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,202
You mean, when the old marina blew up?

288
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,369
That wasn't nothing.

289
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,606
Well, no, I meant nothing that had any
environmental side effects to it.

290
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:31,844
And nobody cares what you blow up as long as
it doesn't release any chemicals being dumped

291
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,379
a lot worse into Possum Lake over the years,
including each other.

292
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,615
I mean, people could see the bottom.

293
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,351
They wouldn't be concerned about a little
bit of pink foam on the top will tell you

294
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:45,124
that it's 100 years of garbage down there,
plus four stoves combination washer dryer.

295
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:50,162
It doesn't old boats, nine car batteries
plus the cars they come out of, and a full

296
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,998
set of patio furniture, including mosquito
coils.

297
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,301
Oh all right. You have an amazing memory for
stuff like that.

298
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,203
Well, it's been a memorable summer, Harold.

299
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:01,773
That's the call of the meeting.

300
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,175
Come on, let's go.

301
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:05,244
Bob and Noel have some answers for it.

302
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:09,982
Well, that'd be worth. Anyway, this is this
should go pretty quickly.

303
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,785
We don't spend a lot of time on
environmental issues, which you probably

304
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:14,486
already guessed.

305
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:31,537
Why did you get a cherry tree with the
pencil when you get a chair, right?

306
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,305
Ok, all right.

307
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,840
Get up, get up.

308
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:46,385
Oh, I'm no longer on this earth kind of guy.

309
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,352
Yeah, yeah, he wants

310
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,521
Me to tell you that he's got a tray of
cookies here.

311
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,422
If anybody's hungry.

312
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,325
Not just now. Thank you very much.

313
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,198
Now the floor recognizes Bob Stuyvesant

314
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:05,804
Leg around while I ran a battery of tests on
the lake water and I think I've been able to

315
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:08,006
pinpoint the source of the pink foam.

316
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:16,515
My goodness, look at that. Well, look, it
was only six over par on that one, wolf.

317
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,518
All right. Oh yeah, right?

318
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:21,987
Well, the foam, the foams.

319
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,990
Two hundred and sixty parts per million of
pine scrub.

320
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,059
It's a common dish detergent.

321
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,528
Well, I guess that lets me off the hook.

322
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,330
I don't use liquid detergent.

323
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,065
Well, it's not liquid.

324
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,366
It's a fine powder.

325
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,134
It's used for dishwashers.

326
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:37,736
Looks a lot like flour.

327
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:42,674
And what are you insinuating that that I'm
using that I'm using detergent instead of

328
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:47,546
flour? Is that it? Oh, give me a this bill.

329
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:48,647
I mean, come on, Andy.

330
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:53,785
It's obvious you're using the detergent in
your baking from one of the cake pans were so

331
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:57,489
easy to clean. Well, I'll tell you whose
fault it is.

332
00:20:57,522 --> 00:21:01,026
It's Murray's fault in those those damn boat
food containers.

333
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:03,762
I mean, who thought the labeling would be
right on it, for heaven's sake?

334
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:08,433
All right. Well, don't worry, the Department
of Natural Resources is on the job.

335
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,938
I've ordered a water bomber to drop a load
of acid on the lake.

336
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,774
It should neutralize the pH and melt the
foam down.

337
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,309
All right. That's really good.

338
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,911
Thank you. Hey, know, pull the weight, aren't
you?

339
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:21,813
Oh yeah. Sorry, right?

340
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:25,017
I got it. I got some great news, everybody.

341
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:30,188
I called the producers of 60 Minutes see if
they wanted to investigate that mystery

342
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:31,456
cottage at the far end of the lake.

343
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,758
You know, the A-frame with the wind, Chad?

344
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:36,895
Well, they weren't too keen on that idea,
but they got real excited about that pink

345
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:41,667
foam, and they're coming up here to do a big
story on pink blossom pond.

346
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,304
And treated like some sort of miracle or
something.

347
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,706
Hey, wait, we're going to have tourists by
the millions.

348
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:55,013
We're all going to be rich. How do you get
it back on one thing, though?

349
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,482
Yeah, I might have led them to believe that.

350
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:00,619
Well, the pink foam cures sick people in
Baltimore.

351
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,022
And you're going to have to stay out of
sight on this one anyway.

352
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,158
They bought it. And we're all going to be
rich.

353
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:12,764
I'd like to see it

354
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,866
Now, which probably, but.

355
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:22,140
It's going to be later. Thank you very much,
Bob.

356
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:23,742
Excellent work as usual.

357
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,846
And how about we reward Bob by having him
entertain us this evening?

358
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,316
Here's what you can do whatever you want
done.

359
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:33,952
Thank you.

360
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:40,425
Well, I just want to talk to you about golf,
and I'll just go change.

361
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,227
Wow, there you go.

362
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:43,895
You learn something every day, don't you?

363
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:47,833
Granted, it's usually the same thing that
you learned the day before and the day before

364
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,836
that. But if repetition wasn't a good thing,
who'd get married?

365
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:55,340
Speaking of which my wife is watching, I'll
be coming straight home after the meeting.

366
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,343
And if the bedroom light is on, I'll take
that to mean that are environmentally

367
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:03,982
friendly. So until next time, on behalf of
myself and Harold and the whole gang up here

368
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:06,084
at Possum Lodge, keep your stick on the ice.

369
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:17,262
Well, then there's her three Iron
Paul boy, she's a.

370
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:20,098
Oh yeah. What a character.

371
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:27,239
A quick, sassy, always lively, though, and
then you're fired.

372
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:32,544
This is the dark web Bookabag, the moody,
unpredictable.

373
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:35,647
Sometimes you're there for you and sometimes
you just post.

374
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:40,085
I can tell you something knowing you'll find
a five iron that stands by you.

375
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:46,491
Take good care of it. Well, wow, you got
your drivers know your woods, and when you

376
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:49,227
play, they'll sit back. Oh, oh oh.
