INTO THE SYSTEM,

WATER TO ESCAPE DOWN
THE DRAIN,

BUT IT ALSO ALLOWS THE SEWER
GASES TO ESCAPE UP INTO
THE ATMOSPHERE,

150
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:26,037
AND STEP THREE, THE EASIEST
ONE OF ALL, START THE CAR.

151
00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:54,232
YOU KNOW, GUYS DON'T LIKE TO
ASK ANYBODY FOR HELP.

152
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:57,268
WOMEN THINK IT'S BECAUSE IT
MAKES US LOOK WEAK.

153
00:08:57,335 --> 00:08:58,937
BUT THAT'S NOT IT.

154
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:02,540
OH, NO, GUYS HATE ASKING
FRIENDS FOR HELP ON A PROJECT

155
00:09:02,574 --> 00:09:06,111
BECAUSE IT MEANS SELLING
YOURSELF INTO SLAVERY.

156
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:09,648
IT'S CALLED, PAYBACK WORK.

157
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:13,551
IF I ASK A FRIEND TO DO
SOMETHING SMART,

158
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:16,154
LIKE BUILD A WINTERIZED
GARAGE FOR MY SNOWMOBILE,

159
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:18,857
THEN I HAVE TO GO HELP
HIM DO SOMETHING STUPID,

160
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,793
LIKE GO POUR A CEMENT PAD
FOR HIS ROCKET LAUNCHER.

161
00:09:21,826 --> 00:09:24,129
NOW, WHY WOULD
I WANT TO DO THAT?

162
00:09:24,162 --> 00:09:26,364
IF I'VE ALREADY
FINISHED MY PROJECT,

163
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:29,000
I DON'T WANT TO
DO ANY MORE WORK?

164
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:33,104
BUT THAT PAYBACK WORK THING
IS NAGGING AWAY AT THE
BACK OF YOUR MIND.

165
00:09:33,171 --> 00:09:36,508
IT'S LIKE THE RELATIVE
STAYING IN THE GUEST ROOM.

166
00:09:36,574 --> 00:09:39,277
NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY,
OR WHAT YOU DO,

167
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,446
IT WILL NOT LEAVE.

168
00:09:42,947 --> 00:09:44,516
SO YOU WANT MY ADVICE?

169
00:09:44,582 --> 00:09:46,417
IF YOU GOT SOMETHING AT YOUR
HOUSE THAT NEEDS FIXING,

170
00:09:46,484 --> 00:09:48,386
HIRE A PROFESSIONAL.

171
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:50,288
IF IT'S NOT BAD ENOUGH
TO NEED A PROFESSIONAL,

172
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:53,491
FIX IT YOURSELF
AND IT WILL BE.

173
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:56,427
BUT BELIEVE ME, YOU'RE BETTER
OFF PAYING IN CASH ONCE,

174
00:09:56,494 --> 00:10:00,732
THEN PAYING IN PAYBACK WORK
THE REST OF THE YOUR LIFE.

175
00:10:00,798 --> 00:10:02,534
REMEMBER,
I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

176
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,536
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

177
00:10:09,374 --> 00:10:12,677
WELL, IT'S BEEN THREE WEEKS
SINCE DALTON AND I
GOT OUR EMUS.

178
00:10:12,744 --> 00:10:14,345
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'VE
MATED YET OR NOT,

179
00:10:14,412 --> 00:10:16,581
BUT JUDGING BY THE WAY THEY'RE
FIGHTING WITH EACH OTHER
ALL THE TIME,

180
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:18,116
I WOULD SAY YES.

181
00:10:18,182 --> 00:10:21,653
Dalton: OKAY, OKAY. BACK OFF.
BACK OFF! NO! OW! BACK OFF!

182
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:25,356
GO ON! BACK! BACK! BACK!

183
00:10:31,963 --> 00:10:35,300
Red: YEAH, YEAH, LITTLE
HENPECKED ARE YOU, DALTON?

184
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:37,835
NO, NO. I'M FINE.

185
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:40,438
HEY, RED!
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

186
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:43,474
WHAT DOES THAT
LOOK LIKE TO YOU?

187
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:46,177
THE BIG BOY BREAKFAST.

188
00:10:46,244 --> 00:10:49,280
IT'S NOT A MEAL, RED.
IT'S A MEAL TICKET.

189
00:10:49,314 --> 00:10:51,883
YEAH?
MONEY FROM THIS.
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SOME REAL

190
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:55,019
HOW MANY EMUS DO
YOU FIGURE ARE IN THERE?

191
00:10:55,086 --> 00:10:56,888
YOU KNOW I WAS GOING TO
TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT,

192
00:10:56,954 --> 00:10:59,957
BECAUSE I THINK WE
GOT TO BE A LITTLE MORE
AGGRESSIVE IN OUR APPROACH.

193
00:11:00,024 --> 00:11:02,860
I THINK WE HAVE TO
GET OURSELVES SOME
MORE EMUS.

194
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:04,862
MORE EMUS?

195
00:11:04,896 --> 00:11:07,031
YOU KNOW, ONLY A MARRIED
PERSON WOULD HAVE
AN APPETITE

196
00:11:07,065 --> 00:11:09,033
FOR THAT MUCH
ABUSE, DALTON.

197
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:11,736
NO PAIN,
NO GAIN, RED.

198
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:14,372
WELL, AN EMU'S ONLY FUNNY
UNTIL SOMEONE LOSES AN EYE.

199
00:11:14,405 --> 00:11:16,140
THAT'S THE WAY
I FEEL ABOUT IT.

200
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:18,443
ANYWAY, WHO'S GONNA
PAY FOR MORE EMUS?

201
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:20,044
I GOT THAT COVERED, OKAY?

202
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:22,180
THERE ARE A BUNCH OF
EMUS IN PORT ASBESTOS,

203
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:26,884
AND THE OWNERS HAVE OFFERED TO
GIVE US THOSE EMUS FOR A SHARE
OF THE UPSIDE, HUH?

204
00:11:26,918 --> 00:11:28,886
SO IT'S GONNA
COST US NOTHING.

205
00:11:28,953 --> 00:11:31,956
THAT SOUNDS HIGH TO ME.

206
00:11:32,256 --> 00:11:34,258
RED, I'M NOT ASKING
YOU FOR MORE MONEY.

207
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:35,593
I'M GONNA DO THE WORK.

208
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,528
NOW, COME ON,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

209
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:39,864
OH, ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD.
I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL
YOUR FUN, DALTON.

210
00:11:39,897 --> 00:11:41,699
OKAY!
YOU WON'T REGRET IT.

211
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:43,968
IT'S A GREAT
OPPORTUNITY.

212
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:46,270
I THINK I HEAR
OPPORTUNITY KNOCKING
THERE ON THE WINDOW.

213
00:11:49,507 --> 00:11:51,275
Red: LOOK OUT! LOOK OUT!

214
00:11:51,342 --> 00:11:54,278
GET BACK! GET BACK! BACK!
GO ON, BACK!

215
00:11:58,783 --> 00:12:01,752
WHEN YOU GET THE NEWS THAT
YOUR SEPTICS HAVE THE OOZE,

216
00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:04,255
AND IT'S GIVING YOU THE BLUES
AND GETTING ON YOUR SHOES.

217
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:05,923
CALL ME, WINSTON,

218
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,925
AND I'LL PUT HER
BACK IN CRUISE.

219
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:14,365
HI, FOLKS.

220
00:12:14,398 --> 00:12:17,368
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN WORKING IN
FILM FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW,

221
00:12:17,435 --> 00:12:19,503
AND I FUNCTION
COMPLETELY ON MY OWN,

222
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,506
WITHOUT ANY OUTSIDE
INFLUENCE WHATSOEVER.

223
00:12:22,573 --> 00:12:24,475
OH, SURE,
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE

224
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:27,878
I'LL PICK UP AND READ MY
PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION THE
HEADQUARTERS DID ON ME,

225
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:30,948
BUT IT'S COMPLETE GARBAGE.

226
00:12:30,982 --> 00:12:34,819
IT'S ENTITLED,
"SOCIOPATH OF THE FOREST."

227
00:12:34,852 --> 00:12:36,621
IT'S NONSENSE.

228
00:12:36,687 --> 00:12:38,689
I'VE BEEN ON EVERY TRAIL
AND PATH IN THIS WOODS,

229
00:12:38,756 --> 00:12:40,658
AND THERE'S NO SUCH THING.

230
00:12:43,594 --> 00:12:46,364
YOU KNOW, WORKING AS I DO,
ALONE, WITH ONLY LIMITED
RESOURCES,

231
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,001
MY FILMS ARE, BY NECESSITY,
AVANT-GARDE,

232
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:54,071
AND AS SUCH, I'VE NEVER BEEN
REVIEWED BY ANY MAINSTREAM
FILM CRITIC.

233
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:58,109
IF THEY DID, I CAN JUST
IMAGINE WHAT THEY'D SAY...

234
00:12:58,142 --> 00:13:02,413
"YES, BEARS DO GO IN
THE WOODS, AND THIS IS
WHAT THEY LEAVE."

235
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,249
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE THEY
DON'T UNDERSTAND THE
SUBTLETIES

236
00:13:05,316 --> 00:13:07,752
THAT ARE SO MUCH
A PART OF THIS MEDIUM.

237
00:13:07,818 --> 00:13:10,154
AND THAT'S WHY I'D RATHER
JUST LET YOU SEE THEM.

238
00:13:10,221 --> 00:13:11,288
AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE THEM,

239
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:13,324
WELL, FINE,
THAT'S THE END OF IT.

240
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:15,025
BUT IF YOU LIKE THEM,
WELL, HECK,

241
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:17,027
WHY DON'T YOU COME UP HERE
AND STAY FOR A YEAR OR TWO,

242
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:18,396
AND WE COULD WATCH THEM OVER
AND OVER AND OVER

243
00:13:18,462 --> 00:13:20,164
AND OVER AND OVER AND.....

244
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:21,866
OH, THAT'D BE GREAT.

245
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,835
ANYWAY, HERE'S THIS
WEEK'S FILM.

246
00:13:24,902 --> 00:13:26,604
I HOPE YOU LOVE IT.

247
00:13:47,925 --> 00:13:49,894
FOLKS, I HOPE EVERYONE
OUT THERE REALIZES

248
00:13:49,927 --> 00:13:51,762
THAT THE BEST WAY
TO PREVENT FOREST FIRES

249
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:54,498
IS TO PREVENT THEM FROM
HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE.

250
00:13:54,565 --> 00:13:57,601
THAT'S HOW I PLAN
TO SAVE THIS FOREST.

251
00:13:57,635 --> 00:14:01,272
THIS FOREST IS ALREADY
BURNT TO THE GROUND,
RANGER GORD.

252
00:14:01,338 --> 00:14:04,041
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU CAN'T SAVE IT NOW.

253
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:07,344
NOT UNLESS YOU'VE GOT A TIME
MACHINE OR SOMETHING.

254
00:14:07,411 --> 00:14:09,079
WELL, YOU'VE
CONVINCED ME, RED.

255
00:14:09,146 --> 00:14:12,349
IN THE FUTURE, I'M WORKING ON
A TIME MACHINE AND WILL
BRING IT BACK HERE

256
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,784
TO THE PRESENT.

257
00:14:17,922 --> 00:14:20,958
HELLO, EVERYONE.
I'M FUTURE GORD.

258
00:14:20,991 --> 00:14:22,459
I FINISHED THE TIME MACHINE,

259
00:14:22,526 --> 00:14:23,894
SO LET'S TAKE A
TRIP INTO THE PAST

260
00:14:23,961 --> 00:14:26,096
AND PREVENT THIS DISASTER
FROM EVER HAPPENING.

261
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,099
FWAAAH,
TWO RANGER GORDS.

262
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:31,802
OH, JUST WHAT
THE WORLD NEEDS.

263
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:33,370
WELL, COME ON YOU TWO.

264
00:14:33,437 --> 00:14:35,072
DO YOU WANT TO
MAKE HISTORY OR NOT?

265
00:14:44,214 --> 00:14:47,451
WHAT'S THIS?
IT LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND OF
MACHINE FROM THE FUTURE.

266
00:14:47,518 --> 00:14:49,653
HELLO, RANGER GORD
OF THE PAST.

267
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,089
I'M GORD OF THE PRESENT,
AND THIS IS GORD
OF THE FUTURE.

268
00:14:52,156 --> 00:14:53,824
WE'VE COME BACK IN TIME

269
00:14:53,857 --> 00:14:56,493
TO PREVENT THIS MAGNIFICENT
FOREST FROM BURNING TO
THE GROUND.

270
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,296
I SEE.
WELL, I HOPE
I CAN BE OF ASSISTANCE.

271
00:14:59,363 --> 00:15:00,998
ACCORDING TO
MY CALCULATIONS,

272
00:15:01,031 --> 00:15:03,534
THIS FOREST WILL BE
IGNITED BY A BOLT
OF LIGHTNING

273
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,036
THAT WILL STRIKE SOMEWHERE IN
THIS VICINITY VERY SHORTLY.

274
00:15:06,103 --> 00:15:08,038
I DOUBT IT,
FUTURE GORD.

275
00:15:08,105 --> 00:15:10,741
THERE ISN'T A
CLOUD IN THE SKY.

276
00:15:13,143 --> 00:15:15,512
AH, HA.
THERE'S THE TROUBLE SPOT.

277
00:15:19,249 --> 00:15:21,852
WE'VE DONE IT.
WE'VE SAVED THE TREES.

278
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:24,488
LET'S ALL TRAVEL INTO
THE FUTURE AND CELEBRATE.

279
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:26,990
WAIT.
WHAT ABOUT THOSE TWO?

280
00:15:27,024 --> 00:15:29,259
HM, WELL, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THEM.

281
00:15:29,293 --> 00:15:31,361
THEY NEVER HAD
MUCH OF A FUTURE ANYWAY.

282
00:15:31,395 --> 00:15:34,631
( laughing )

283
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:04,394
THIS IS A BRAINWAVE
I HAD LAST FALL,

284
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:06,330
BUT I HAD TO WAIT 'TIL
NOW TO SHOW IT TO YOU.

285
00:16:06,396 --> 00:16:08,765
YOU KNOW WHAT A PAIN IT IS
TO GET RID OF THE LEAVES
IN THE AUTUMN?

286
00:16:08,832 --> 00:16:11,034
WELL, WHAT I DID IS I JUST
RAKE THEM UP INTO A BIG
PILE LIKE THIS,

287
00:16:11,101 --> 00:16:13,403
SPRAY THEM WITH WATER
'TIL THEY FROZE SOLID.

288
00:16:15,372 --> 00:16:17,808
OH, THAT'S THE BARBECUE.

289
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:19,276
HERE. HERE'S THE LEAVES.

290
00:16:19,343 --> 00:16:20,911
THIS IS THE
LEAF PILE RIGHT HERE.

291
00:16:20,944 --> 00:16:22,312
MAYBE A BIGGER PILE
THAN I THOUGHT.

292
00:16:22,346 --> 00:16:24,448
THESE ARE THE
LEAVES FOR SURE.

293
00:16:24,514 --> 00:16:26,083
( dog barking )

294
00:16:26,116 --> 00:16:27,384
NO, HERE WE ARE.

295
00:16:27,451 --> 00:16:28,952
THESE ARE THE LEAVES.
YEAH, THIS IS THEM.

296
00:16:28,986 --> 00:16:31,054
OH, YEAH, 'CAUSE I LEFT THE
CHAIN SAW HERE TO REMIND ME.

297
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:32,489
'CAUSE WHAT I DO NOW,

298
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:35,158
I TAKE THE FROZEN LEAVES,
CUT THEM INTO A LOG
SHAPE AND SIZE

299
00:16:35,192 --> 00:16:37,194
AND I CAN BURN THEM
IN THE FIREPLACE.

300
00:16:47,771 --> 00:16:49,806
OKAY, THAT'S THE
MANURE PILE.

301
00:16:53,577 --> 00:16:55,645
YOU KNOW, THESE UP CLOSE
AND PERSONAL DEALS

302
00:16:55,712 --> 00:16:57,414
ARE VERY POPULAR WITH THE
TELEVISION AUDIENCE

303
00:16:57,447 --> 00:16:59,216
AND, OF COURSE, WE'RE
ALWAYS LOOKING FOR FILLER.

304
00:16:59,282 --> 00:17:03,120
SO, RIGHT NOW, WE'RE GOING
TO FIND A LITTLE BIT MORE

305
00:17:03,186 --> 00:17:07,657
ABOUT THE MAN WE'VE COME
TO KNOW AS MIKE HAMAR.

306
00:17:07,724 --> 00:17:11,461
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE
ME CRY, YOU KNOW THAT.

307
00:17:11,528 --> 00:17:12,763
NO. NO.
I'M FINE WITH THAT.

308
00:17:12,796 --> 00:17:14,464
MIKE, YOU'VE HAD
A COLOURFUL LIFE.

309
00:17:14,531 --> 00:17:17,267
WHY DON'T YOU TELL US
ABOUT THE EARLY YEARS
OF YOUR CHILDHOOD?

310
00:17:17,334 --> 00:17:20,237
OKAY, WELL, WE HAD A
PRETTY NORMAL FAMILY.

311
00:17:20,303 --> 00:17:23,507
MOM WAS AN EXOTIC
DANCER AND,

312
00:17:23,573 --> 00:17:27,944
UH, I HAD SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
THREE AND SEVEN DADS,

313
00:17:28,278 --> 00:17:31,915
DEPENDING UPON HOW MUCH BAIL
MONEY WE COULD COME UP WITH.

314
00:17:32,215 --> 00:17:34,885
AND WHICH ONE OF THOSE GUYS
WAS YOUR BIOLOGICAL FATHER?

315
00:17:34,918 --> 00:17:38,121
WELL, MOM WAS NEVER
SURE ABOUT THAT.

316
00:17:38,154 --> 00:17:40,757
SEE, SHE'S A
HEAVY SLEEPER.

317
00:17:45,228 --> 00:17:46,796
NOW, WAS THERE
JUST YOU, MIKE,

318
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,531
OR DID YOU HAVE
BROTHERS AND SISTERS?

319
00:17:48,598 --> 00:17:49,966
OH, SURE.

320
00:17:50,033 --> 00:17:51,501
THERE WERE SEVEN OF US,
ALL UNDER SEVEN.

321
00:17:51,534 --> 00:17:53,103
I WAS THE YOUNGEST.

322
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:55,739
MOM USED TO BLAME ME FOR
LOSING HER JOB

323
00:17:55,772 --> 00:17:58,041
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, LIKE,
WHEN SHE WAS CARRYING ME,

324
00:17:58,074 --> 00:17:59,743
SHE GAINED A LOT OF WEIGHT,

325
00:17:59,776 --> 00:18:03,413
AND SHE GOT BIGGER THAN
SOME OF THE TABLES SHE
WAS DANCING ON.

326
00:18:03,446 --> 00:18:08,018
SO -- BUT, ACTUALLY,
IT WAS QUITE A HAPPY
FAMILY ENVIRONMENT.

327
00:18:08,084 --> 00:18:10,787
OH, YEAH, SO WOULD
YOU SAY YOUR HOUSE WAS
FULL OF LOVE, THEN?

328
00:18:10,854 --> 00:18:13,823
IT WAS ON SATURDAY
NIGHTS, YEAH.

329
00:18:14,157 --> 00:18:17,027
NO. NO, I MEAN YOU WEREN'T
LACKING IN ANYTHING, YOU KNOW.

330
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,829
YOU HAD THE NORMAL STUFF,
TOYS AND BIKES AND THAT
KIND OF THING.

331
00:18:19,863 --> 00:18:24,067
OH, SURE, YEAH, I HAD ALL THE
SAME KIND OF TOYS AS THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD KIDS.

332
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,037
IN FACT, I HAD THEIRS.

333
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,306
SEE, MY FAMILY ALWAYS
BELIEVED IN SHARING.

334
00:18:30,373 --> 00:18:32,175
SO IF A STRANGER
HAD SOMETHING,

335
00:18:32,242 --> 00:18:34,978
WE THOUGHT THEY SHOULD
SHARE IT WITH US.

336
00:18:35,045 --> 00:18:37,714
YOU HAD KIND OF A COMMUNAL
ATTITUDE TOWARD POSSESSIONS?

337
00:18:37,781 --> 00:18:40,417
YEAH, SEE, WE WEREN'T HUNG UP
ABOUT POSSESSIONS, RIGHT.

338
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,752
BUT, OH, BOY,
THOSE COPS SURE WERE.

339
00:18:42,819 --> 00:18:44,087
OH, MAN.

340
00:18:44,154 --> 00:18:45,722
THAT'S ALL THEY'D EVER
TALK ABOUT, RIGHT,

341
00:18:45,755 --> 00:18:48,358
POSSESSION, TRAFFICKING.

342
00:18:48,391 --> 00:18:50,460
OH, I SEE. ALL RIGHT.
I SEE WHERE WE'RE
GOING WITH THIS.

343
00:18:50,493 --> 00:18:52,629
WELL, MIKE, YOU KNOW,
I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU MORE,

344
00:18:52,695 --> 00:18:54,764
BUT SO MUCH OF THIS IS
STILL BEFORE THE COURTS,

345
00:18:54,831 --> 00:18:57,834
AND WE'RE RUNNING A
LITTLE SHORT OF TIME,

346
00:18:57,867 --> 00:19:00,336
SO MAYBE WHAT YOU COULD DO,
IN THE LAST FEW SECONDS,

347
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,605
IS SUM UP, YOU KNOW,
LOOK RIGHT OUT THERE
INTO THE AUDIENCE

348
00:19:02,672 --> 00:19:04,674
AND, UH, GIVE THE
YOUNGSTERS OUT THERE

349
00:19:04,707 --> 00:19:07,143
A LITTLE BIT OF ADVICE
ON LIFE, IF YOU WOULD.

350
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,979
OKAY, OKAY.
LIFE, YEAH, SURE.
OKAY.

351
00:19:10,013 --> 00:19:13,616
IT'S NOT THAT BAD, YOU KNOW?

352
00:19:15,251 --> 00:19:18,755
THEY CALL IT LIFE,
BUT REALLY IT'S ONLY 25 YEARS.

353
00:19:24,127 --> 00:19:25,495
HI, I'M WINSTON.

354
00:19:25,562 --> 00:19:29,032
LOVE MEANS NEVER HAVING
TO SEE YOUR SEWAGE.

CALL ROTHSCHILD'S.

356

OH, THIS IS
GOING WELL.

357
00:19:48,251 --> 00:19:51,020
AND THANK YOU, DALTON,
FOR AN EXCITING BUSINESS
OPPORTUNITY.

WOULD BE THIS HOSTILE.

OH, NO,
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

364

YOU DON'T WANT ANY ANIMAL

WE GOING TO DO?

GOING TO DO.

WE'RE GOING
TO GIVE THEM AWAY.

WHO'S GONNA TAKE THEM?

ANYTHING YOU GIVE
THEM, DALTON.
