1
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:03,770
IF YOU'RE
ANYTHING LIKE ME,

2
00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:05,805
AFTER CHRISTMAS
DINNER LAST YEAR,

3
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:08,808
YOU ENDED UP STRETCHED OUT
ON THE SOFA WITH YOUR
PANTS UNDONE, MOANING,

4
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:12,145
WHY DIDN'T SOMEBODY
STOP ME?

5
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:14,981
WELL, HERE'S A LOW FAT
ALTERNATIVE TO EATING
ALL THAT TURKEY AT CHRISTMAS.

6
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:17,383
IT'S GONNA TAKE THE
STRAIN OFF YOUR WAISTBAND,

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,552
AND ALSO GET YOU
OUT IN THE FRESH AIR.

8
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,054
OKAY, THE FIRST
THING YOU WANNA DO

9
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,490
IS GRAB THE FROZEN TURKEY;
GET IT OUT OF THE FREEZER

10
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:24,791
BEFORE IT DEFROSTS.

11
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:28,528
THEN WHAT YOU WANNA DO IS TAKE
THE DOOR HANDLE OFF THE FRIDGE.

12
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:29,662
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

13
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,331
THIS WAY YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO GET INTO THE FRIDGE,

14
00:00:31,397 --> 00:00:33,032
SO YOU CAN'T SNEAK DOWN IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

15
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,468
TO EAT ANOTHER HANDFUL
OF JELLIED SALAD.

16
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,903
NOW ALL YOU GOTTA DO

17
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:39,405
IS ATTACH THE DOOR
HANDLE TO THE TURKEY

18
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,141
THE WAY I'VE DONE HERE.

19
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:44,544
AND YOU CAN CURL THAT BIRD
TO A LEANER, HEALTHIER YOU.

20
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,723
[ APPLAUSE ]

21
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:01,928
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

22
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,499
ALL RIGHT.

23
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,333
YEAH. YEAH.

24
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:12,772
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

25
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:14,340
THANK YOU.

26
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,476
YEAH, WE SURE APPRECIATE THAT.

27
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:18,177
AND ALL THE BEST
TO YOU AND YOURS

28
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,746
FROM ME AND MINE
AND HIS AND HERS,

29
00:01:19,812 --> 00:01:21,981
AND WHATEVER ELSE
IT SAYS ON THE TOWELS.

30
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,816
THIS HERE IS OUR
CHRISTMAS SPECIAL,

31
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:25,518
AND AS YOU CAN SEE,
HAROLD CAME UP --

32
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,420
OH.

33
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,188
THAT'S, UH, QUITE AN
OUTFIT YOU GOT THERE.

34
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,456
YOU SHOULD
NOT STAND STILL.

35
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,592
PEOPLE WILL PUT
PRESENTS UNDER YOU.

36
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,093
YEAH, I THOUGHT YOU
MIGHT APPRECIATE IT.

37
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,962
IT'S MY CHRISTMAS OUTFIT.

38
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,765
YEAH, WELL, IT'S BETTER
THAN YOUR BIRTHDAY SUIT.

39
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,600
ANYWAYS, GREAT
TO HAVE YOU UP HERE

40
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,068
FOR THE WHOLE CHRISTMAS
BREAK, HAROLD.

41
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,436
APPRECIATE IT.

42
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:45,271
NO, NO, NO, I'M JUST HERE
FOR THE CHRISTMAS SHOW.
WHAT?

43
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:46,773
YEAH, THE COMPANY ASKED
ME TO WORK OVER CHRISTMAS,

44
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:48,041
AND I SAID YES.

45
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:50,043
AH, HAROLD, NO.
LOOK, YOU GOTTA
LEARN TO SAY NO.

46
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,277
IT'S NOT THAT HARD.

47
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,346
JUST PRETEND YOU'RE
YOUR OWN GIRLFRIEND,

48
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:58,017
WHICH I'M SURE
YOU ARE.

49
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,156
YOU KNOW, I WAS KINDA HOPING
YOU WOULD KNOCK IT OFF
WITH THE INSULTS,

50
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,891
YOU KNOW, BEING CHRISTMAS
AND EVERYTHING.

51
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,459
AH, HAROLD,
I'M KIDDING YOU.

52
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:07,994
WHEN I INSULT
YOU LIKE THAT,

53
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,595
THAT'S BECAUSE
I LIKE YOU.

54
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,597
OH!
YEAH.

55
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:12,732
OH, OKAY.
YEAH.

56
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:14,434
THAT'S COOL.
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, YEAH.

57
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,368
WELL, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH THEN,

58
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,336
YOU FAT, OLD,
BURNED-OUT DUFUS.

59
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:20,740
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ]

60
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:32,385
I'M HERE WITH LOCAL EXPLOSIVES
ENTHUSIAST, EDGAR MONTROSE.

61
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:34,887
EDGAR, I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU HAVE A SPECIAL
CHRISTMAS DISPLAY FOR US.

62
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,989
OH, NOT FOR ME,
THANKS, RED.

63
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:40,893
BUT I WILL HAVE A SLICE
OF THAT PUMPKIN PIE LATER.

64
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,929
THAT'S NOT WHY
I'M HERE, THOUGH.

65
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:44,263
RIGHT.

66
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:50,403
I HAVE A CHRISTMAS MUSICAL
DISPLAY I WANNA SHOW YOU.

67
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:52,638
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
RESONANCE IS, RED?

68
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:55,074
YEAH, THAT'S WHERE
SOMETHING VIBRATES LOUD.

69
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:56,809
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

70
00:02:56,842 --> 00:02:59,478
IT'S WHERE SOMETHING
VIBRATES LOUD.

71
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,116
AND YOU ALMOST GET
KIND OF A MUSICAL NOTE.

72
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,852
THE SMALLER THE CONTAINER
THAT RESONATES,

73
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:09,322
THE HIGHER THE MUSICAL
NOTE THAT YOU'LL GET.

74
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,290
OH, SO EACH ONE OF
THESE CONTAINERS

75
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,292
MAKES A DIFFERENT
MUSICAL NOTE?

76
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,728
YOU NEED TO PAY A
LITTLE BETTER ATTENTION.

77
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:18,898
'CAUSE EACH ONE OF
THESE CONTAINERS MAKES
A DIFFERENT MUSICAL NOTE.

78
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,202
NOW, LISTEN UP.
THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART.

79
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:27,139
I PUT A CHARGE OF
DYNAMITE IN EACH CAN,

80
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,709
AND I HOOKED IT
UP TO MY KEYBOARD.

81
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,077
SEE?

82
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:36,282
I CALL IT MY
PIPE BOMB ORGAN.

83
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,556
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR A
LITTLE CHRISTMAS MUSIC, RED?

84
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:46,158
YOU KNOW, I THINK I'LL JUST
LISTEN FROM BACK IN --

85
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:47,827
IN -- IN THIS AREA.

86
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,395
YOU GO AHEAD, THOUGH.

87
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,797
THIS IS MY FAVOURITE
CHRISTMAS CAROL.

88
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:54,166
FEEL FREE TO
SING ALONG.

89
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:56,602
A LITTLE SOMETHING
I LIKE TO CALL

90
00:03:56,635 --> 00:03:58,537
SILENT NIGHT.

91
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:06,278
SI-L-ENT NIGHT

92
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:09,448
HO-OH-LY NIGHT

93
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,519
A-A-ALL IS --

94
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:17,890
YOU KNOW, A BIG PART OF
CHRISTMAS HAS TO BE THE EATING.

95
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,625
SOMETHING JUST
COMES OVER PEOPLE.

96
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:22,928
THEY START CHOWING DOWN LIKE
THEY WERE STOCKING UP
A BOMB SHELTER.

97
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,997
BUT THERE'S ALSO
A DOWNSIDE.

98
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:28,133
MESSIN' UP YOUR HOUSE
WITH ALL THOSE PEOPLE.

99
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,303
AND MESSIN' UP YOUR KITCHEN,
COOKING ALL THAT FOOD.

100
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,771
BUT YOU KNOW
SOMETHING?

101
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,740
THERE'S A BETTER WAY.

102
00:04:36,675 --> 00:04:38,978
OKAY, THE FIRST STEP IS YOU
CALL UP ONE OF YOUR RELATIVES

103
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:42,214
AND TELL THEM THAT AFTER 43
CHRISTMASES OF MOOCHING
OFF EVERYONE ELSE,

104
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:45,351
IT'S FINALLY THEIR TURN
TO HAVE CHRISTMAS DINNER.

105
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:48,053
OH, SURE, THEY'LL
PROBABLY BALK AT FIRST.

106
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,688
BUT THEN YOU GIVE
THEM THE CLINCHER.

107
00:04:49,755 --> 00:04:51,657
YOU'LL BRING THE FOOD.

108
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,392
NOW, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.

109
00:04:53,425 --> 00:04:54,560
"WAIT A MINUTE, RED.

110
00:04:54,593 --> 00:04:56,228
"THAT STILL MESSES
UP YOUR KITCHEN."

111
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:58,597
OR "HEY, RED,
I DON'T GET IT."

112
00:04:58,664 --> 00:05:01,567
OR "BOY, I WISH I HAD
A PAIR PANTS LIKE THOSE."

113
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:04,069
BUT THE KEY TO
THE WHOLE DEAL IS

114
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,872
WE'RE GOING TO COOK CHRISTMAS
DINNER AS WE DRIVE OVER THERE.

115
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,409
OKAY, FIRST THING
YOU WANNA DO,

116
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,844
GET THE AIR CLEANER
OFF THERE

117
00:05:11,877 --> 00:05:14,947
AND PUT THE TURKEY RIGHT
ON TOP OF THE ENGINE BOX.

118
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:17,549
NOW TAKE THE ENGINE
THERMOSTAT CONTROL UNIT

119
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:20,419
AND JAM THAT UP THE REAR
END OF THE TURKEY.

120
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:22,221
NOW, THAT'LL AFFECT YOUR
TEMPERATURE GAGE.

121
00:05:22,287 --> 00:05:25,591
YOU GOTTA CHANGE --
SHOW YOU WHEN THE
TURKEY'S DONE.

122
00:05:25,924 --> 00:05:27,993
AND YOU WANNA DISCONNECT YOUR
WINDSHIELD WASHER FLUID,

123
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,529
AND YOU WANNA FILL THAT UP
WITH THE TURKEY GRAVY.

124
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:33,932
THEN YOU PUT THE INTAKE
UNIT BACK IN THERE.

125
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:36,335
YOU DON'T WANT THAT
ALL OVER YOUR WINDSHIELD,

126
00:05:36,368 --> 00:05:38,170
SO YOU WANNA REDIRECT
THE SQUIRTER --

127
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:39,805
ACTUALLY PUT A PIECE
OF DUCT TAPE ON THERE

128
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,074
AND AIM HER ALL OVER THERE,
ALL OVER THE TURKEY.

129
00:05:44,676 --> 00:05:47,646
AND NOW WHEN YOU ADD THE --
APPLY THE WINDSHIELD
WASHER STUFF,

130
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:49,615
YOU'RE ACTUALLY
BASTING THE BIRD.

131
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:52,985
ALL RIGHT, NEXT THING
YOU WANNA DO IS

132
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:55,354
YOU WANNA FILL THE
RAD WITH FROZEN PEAS.

133
00:05:57,756 --> 00:05:59,425
BOY, I CAN ALMOST
TASTE THOSE NOW.

134
00:05:59,491 --> 00:06:01,593
HERE'S SOMETHING NEW.

135
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,562
TAKE YOUR LIGHTER,
PUT A MUSHROOM CAP ON
THE END OF IT.

136
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,665
YOU CAN THEM RIGHT OUT OF THE
CIGARETTE LIGHTER UNIT THERE.

137
00:06:06,698 --> 00:06:08,767
PUT THAT ONE IN THE JAR,
PUT A NEW ONE ON.

138
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:10,869
GOING INTO THE THERMOS
THERE TO KEEP THEM WARM.

139
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,172
A NICE TREAT FOR NON-SMOKERS.

140
00:06:13,472 --> 00:06:14,840
HERE'S HOW YOU MAKE
THE MASHED POTATOES.

141
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:17,543
JUST PUT 'EM
INSIDE THE HUBCAP.

142
00:06:17,843 --> 00:06:19,011
NOW, YOU NEED
THE WHEEL TO BE WARM,

143
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:21,747
SO YOU PUT THE EMERGENCY
BRAKE ON, THREE CLICKS.

144
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,784
YOU PUT THE PIE IN BEHIND THE
TURKEY ON THE ENGINE BLOCK.

145
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:27,186
NOW, YOU WANNA
MAKE WHIPPED CREAM?

146
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:28,587
NO PROBLEM.

147
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,092
STICK THAT BACK ON THE RIM,
YOU'RE IN BUSINESS.

148
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,028
CORN ON THE COB
INTO A JAR,

149
00:06:36,094 --> 00:06:38,030
TAKE ONE OF THE SPARK PLUGS,
ATTACH THAT TO THE LID.

150
00:06:40,165 --> 00:06:43,101
EVERY EIGHT BANGS,
YOU COOK A COB.

151
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:45,871
YOU PUT THE DOUGH -- LITTLE
DOUGH FOR MAKING ROLLS
INTO THE AIR CLEANER.

152
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:46,939
PUT THAT BACK ON.

153
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:48,307
THEY'LL DROP DOWN
THROUGH THE CARB

154

THROUGH THE INTAKE MANIFOLD
AND COME OUT THE EXHAUST,

155
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:51,710
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU GOTTA DO FIRST...

156
00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:53,946
A LITTLE BREAD BASKET TO GRAB
'EM AS THEY COME OUT.

157
00:06:56,782 --> 00:06:58,450
NOW YOU JUST
START HER UP,

158
00:06:58,483 --> 00:07:00,218
AND OUT THEY COME.

159
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:02,354
FIRST, A COUPLE
OF REGULAR ROLLS.

160
00:07:02,387 --> 00:07:04,022
AND THEN A BRAN ONE.

161
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:05,991
YEAH.

162
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:11,596
ALL RIGHT, YOU DRIVE OVER TO
WHEREVER YOU'RE HAVING YOUR
CHRISTMAS DINNER,

163
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,931
AND BY THE TIME
YOU GET THERE,

164
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,866
EVERYTHING SHOULD
BE PRETTY MUCH READY.

165
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,301
SO YOU JUST
POP THE HOOD,

166
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,637
AND LET'S JUST SEE HOW
EVERYTHING LOOKS.

167
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,706

YOU'RE DRIVING TOO.

168
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:22,708
OH, LOOK AT THAT TURKEY.
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING.

169

OH, IT'S HOT!

GET THAT INSIDE
AND THEN COME BACK OUT.

172
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,515
OKAY, THE CORN
NOT SO GOOD.

AT THE ONE END,

I WAS A KID.

MASHED POTATOES OFF THERE.

PROBLEM THERE.

BUT I KNOW
THEY'LL BE FINE.

178

NOW, UH, OKAY, I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW TO GET THE PEAS OUT.

179
00:07:47,532 --> 00:07:49,034

TO PERFECTION.

AND THEN YOU WANNA
WHEEL THAT AROUND,

182
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,338
I BELIEVE IT WAS THE
PASSENGER WHEEL ON THAT.

183
00:07:53,405 --> 00:07:55,407
YOU HOOK UP THE HOSE,
THE TIRE FILLER HOSE,

184
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:57,209
AND THEN YOU JUST REVERSE

WELL, THERE YOU GO.

TURKEY ON AN OLD VAN
INSTEAD OF A CAR,

188

WE COULD'VE
CALLED IT COQ OLD VAN

WRITTEN ON THE LABEL.

CARVE THE TURKEY?

CALL IT A FAN BLADE.

00:13:30,307 --> 00:13:31,942
WELL, FOR THE LAST
PART OF THE TRIP,

306
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:36,413
HE WEARS THIS BIG BROWN
SNOWMOBILE SUIT THING.

307
00:13:38,182 --> 00:13:39,917
WHAT'S STICKING OUT OF
YOUR SLEEVE THERE, HAP?

308
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,352
OH, WHAT'S THAT?

309
00:13:41,418 --> 00:13:42,620
WELL, I DUNNO.

310
00:13:42,653 --> 00:13:43,487
OH, IT SEEMS TO BE

311
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:46,390
A LIST OF SOME KIND.
OH, MAN.

312

I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS STUFF, HAP.

314
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:52,496
OH, I KNOW.

315
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,698
DOUBTING PEOPLE
IS A COMMON FLAW.

316
00:13:54,765 --> 00:13:56,967
SOME PEOPLE DON'T EVEN
BELIEVE IN SANTA CLAUS.

317
00:13:57,034 --> 00:13:59,970
THAT'S WHY I FEEL
SO MUCH FOR THE MAN.

318
00:14:00,037 --> 00:14:01,338
SO YOU WEAR
HIS COAT?

319
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:03,107
RED.

320
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:06,076
I'D GLADLY GIVE UP
ALL MY WORLD RECORDS,

321
00:14:06,143 --> 00:14:07,311
ALL THE MEDALS,

322
00:14:07,378 --> 00:14:10,080
ALL THE SCIENTIFIC
BREAKTHROUGHS,

323
00:14:10,114 --> 00:14:13,384
ALL THE INVENTIONS
AND THE FAME, EVERYTHING.

324
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:14,652
I'D GIVE
IT ALL UP --

325
00:14:14,685 --> 00:14:17,154
OTHER THAN THE
WOMEN, OF COURSE,

326
00:14:17,488 --> 00:14:20,291
IF I COULD CONVINCE PEOPLE
THAT THERE IS A SANTA CLAUS.

327
00:14:20,357 --> 00:14:22,126
SO THAT'S WHY I'M WEARING
THIS COAT ALL WINTER;

328
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:24,528
SO PEOPLE WILL ACCEPT THAT
SANTA'S IN THEIR HEARTS

329
00:14:24,595 --> 00:14:26,196
ALL YEAR ROUND.

330
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,564
OH, HERE IT IS.

331
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:29,033
NO, NO, NO,
I GOT A BETTER HAT.

332
00:14:29,099 --> 00:14:30,467
I GOT A BETTER
HAT, LOOK.

333

EASTER BUNNY
LEFT IT FOR YOU.

334
00:14:35,773 --> 00:14:37,041
YOU KNOW, AROUND
CHRISTMAS TIME,

335
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:39,176
A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO
BUY PETS FOR THEIR KIDS.

336
00:14:39,243 --> 00:14:43,314
SO I THOUGHT I'D GET
LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL
OFFICER, ED FRID,

337
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,417
TO GIVE US SOME

SO, UH, ED, WHAT GIFT
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND FOR,

342
00:14:55,926 --> 00:14:57,027
SAY, A NINE- OR
TEN-YEAR-OLD?

343
00:14:57,094 --> 00:14:58,962
A BOOK.

344
00:14:59,263 --> 00:15:01,532
NO, I MEAN WHAT KIND OF
ANIMAL WOULD YOU RECOMMEND?

345
00:15:01,565 --> 00:15:02,933
ACTUALLY, LIKE MICE HERE.
WOULD THAT BE GOOD?

346
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,868
OH, NO, NOT MICE.
NO, THEY'RE RODENTS.

347
00:15:04,935 --> 00:15:06,503
YEAH, THEY CARRY DISEASE,

348
00:15:06,537 --> 00:15:08,772
AND THEY CAN GNAW RIGHT THROUGH
YOUR SKULL AND EVERYTHING.

349
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:12,609
WELL, MAYBE IF YOU
HAD CHEESE FOR BRAINS.

350

DON'T EVER JOKE
AROUND THE MICE, RED.

SO MICE ARE TOO SERIOUS.

HOW ABOUT THIS GUY HERE,
THIS BUNNY RABBIT.

353
00:15:21,785 --> 00:15:23,086
IS THAT A GOOD IDEA?

354
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,254
WELL, SURE,

00:15:24,288 --> 00:15:25,589
BUT YOU KNOW RABBITS,

356
00:15:25,656 --> 00:15:26,890
THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT THEY LIKE TO DO A LOT

357
00:15:26,957 --> 00:15:29,359
THAT MAYBE YOU DON'T WANT YOUR
KIDS WATCHING, YOU KNOW.

THOSE THIGH MUSCLES?

364
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:45,709

IT'S A, YOU KNOW,

761
00:33:11,185 --> 00:33:12,820
OFFICE CHRISTMAS PARTY.

762
00:33:15,522 --> 00:33:16,757
Red: WELL, WE THOUGHT
FOR CHRISTMAS

763
00:33:16,824 --> 00:33:18,726
IT'D BE JUST PERFECT
TO MAKE A SNOWMAN,

764
00:33:18,792 --> 00:33:20,160
AND YOUNG WALTER
COME UP THERE,

765
00:33:20,227 --> 00:33:21,762
AND HE BROUGHT
THE HAT AND --

766
00:33:21,795 --> 00:33:22,963
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

767
00:33:22,996 --> 00:33:25,332
HE HAD A CARROT FOR
THE NOSE AND EVERYTHING.

768
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:27,101
SO HE'S ALL SET.

769
00:33:27,134 --> 00:33:29,103
SO WE'RE JUST GONNA START
WITH A COUPLE OF SNOWBALLS

770
00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:31,138
AND JUST ROLL 'EM.
THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT.

771
00:33:31,171 --> 00:33:33,807
THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT THIS WA
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME.

772
00:33:33,874 --> 00:33:34,908
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
COME MY WAY.

773
00:33:34,975 --> 00:33:36,143
WHY DON'T WE STAY
TOGETHER ON THIS?

774
00:33:36,176 --> 00:33:37,277
YEAH, THAT'S BETTER.

775
00:33:37,344 --> 00:33:39,012
SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL,
JUST ROLLING.

776
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:40,714
IF YOU GET THE RIGHT SNOW,
IF IT'S PACKING --

777
00:33:40,748 --> 00:33:42,382
AND I'M GETTIN' THERE.

778
00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:45,486
THE THING IS YOU GOTTA
FIGURE OUT HOW BIG YOU
WANNA MAKE EACH ONE

779
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,287
BECAUSE I THINK YOU
NEED THREE, DON'T YOU?

780
00:33:47,321 --> 00:33:48,422
OR TWO OR THREE.

781
00:33:48,455 --> 00:33:49,857
ONE FOR THE BODY,
ONE FOR THE MIDDLE,

782
00:33:49,923 --> 00:33:51,692
AND ONE FOR THE OTHER PART.

783
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:53,627
AND MINE'S COMING
ALONG PRETTY GOOD,

784
00:33:53,694 --> 00:33:56,663
BUT, YOU KNOW, WALTER --

785
00:33:56,697 --> 00:33:58,799
HIS SNOWBALL'S NOT
GETTING ANY BIGGER.

786
00:33:58,832 --> 00:34:00,667
WHY WOULD THAT BE, I WONDER?

787
00:34:00,701 --> 00:34:02,736
OH.

788
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:05,038
OKAY, NOW, THAT WOULD
BE A SOFTBALL.

789
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,542
AH, OKAY, GOOD.

790
00:34:08,609 --> 00:34:10,644
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

791
00:34:10,677 --> 00:34:12,679
OKAY, SO WALTER'S
GOT A GOOD IDEA.

792
00:34:12,746 --> 00:34:13,780
HE'S GONNA START AGAIN.

793
00:34:13,814 --> 00:34:14,882
NO, HE'S GONNA
HAND ME THAT ONE,

794
00:34:14,948 --> 00:34:16,316
HE'S GONNA TAKE
OVER MY SNOWBALL --

795
00:34:16,383 --> 00:34:17,518
I SEE.

796
00:34:17,551 --> 00:34:18,519
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

797
00:34:18,585 --> 00:34:20,521
SO AGAIN, WALTER'S
A LITTLE YOUNGER,

798
00:34:20,587 --> 00:34:22,256
AND THIS SOMETHING FOR
THE YOUNG FOLKS TO ENJOY.

799
00:34:22,289 --> 00:34:24,658
I'M GONNA LET HIM DECIDE HOW
BIG I SHOULD MAKE MINE.

800
00:34:24,725 --> 00:34:25,959
MINE'S GETTING THERE.

801
00:34:25,993 --> 00:34:27,461
NO, NO, KEEP GOING.
KEEP GOING.

802
00:34:27,494 --> 00:34:30,030
WALTER'S COMING
ALONG PRETTY GOOD THERE.

803
00:34:30,063 --> 00:34:31,865
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD ONE.
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD ONE.

804
00:34:31,932 --> 00:34:33,066
YEP, YEP.

805
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,202
AND, UH, MINE'S

806
00:34:35,269 --> 00:34:36,403

807
00:34:36,436 --> 00:34:39,106
BOY, WALTER, THAT'S
GETTING PRETTY, UH --

808
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:41,575
THAT'S GETTING PRETTY
AMBITIOUS THERE, WALTER.

809
00:34:41,642 --> 00:34:44,378
'CAUSE WE GOTTA PICK
THESE UP AT SOME POINT.

810
00:34:44,444 --> 00:34:46,246
THAT MAY --
WALTER, THAT MAY BE ENOUGH.

811
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,714
WALTER --
MINE'S GETTIN' --

812
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:49,716
YOU KNOW, I THINK WE'RE --
I THINK --

813
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:53,587
OH, WALTER.
HOLY MACKEREL.

814
00:34:53,654 --> 00:34:55,822
HOLY JUMPIN'.

815
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:58,659
NOW, YOU SEE, YOU CAN'T EVEN
PUSH IT UP THE HILL.

816
00:34:58,692 --> 00:35:00,761
YOU CAN'T EVEN --
YEAH. YEAH.

817
00:35:00,827 --> 00:35:02,863
NO, NO, DON'T LEAVE --
IT'LL COME --

818
00:35:02,929 --> 00:35:03,997
LOOK OUT.
IT'LL COME.

819
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:06,066
DON'T LEAVE IT.
YOU CAN'T LEAVE IT.

820
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:07,601
TOO MUCH?
OH, BOY.

821
00:35:07,668 --> 00:35:08,735
OH, BOY!

822
00:35:08,769 --> 00:35:09,803

00:35:11,004 --> 00:35:11,938

OH, OH, OH!

826
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,408
IT'S COMING AFTER YOU --

827
00:35:14,474 --> 00:35:15,409
OH!

828
00:35:15,475 --> 00:35:17,744
OH, OH, OH!

829
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:18,679
OH, NO, HE HE'S FINE.

830
00:35:18,712 --> 00:35:19,880
HE'S GOOD.
HE'S ALL RIGHT.

831
00:35:19,946 --> 00:35:21,448
YEP, YEP, YEP.

832
00:35:21,481 --> 00:35:23,617
BOY, OH, SHE'S
HEADING FOR THE RAMP.

833
00:35:23,683 --> 00:35:25,752
GET OUT OF THE WAY.
WALTER, GET OUT OF THE WAY!

834
00:35:25,819 --> 00:35:28,321
OH-OH.
O-O-OH!

835
00:35:28,388 --> 00:35:30,924
THAT'S COMING --
INCOMING.

836
00:35:30,991 --> 00:35:33,493
OH, MY --
AND THERE'S MINE.

837
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,930
OH!

838
00:35:37,631 --> 00:35:39,099
OH, HEY.

839
00:35:42,536 --> 00:35:44,204
THERE'S OUR SNOWMAN.

840
00:35:50,911 --> 00:35:52,078
THIS IS WINSTON ROTHSCHILD

841
00:35:52,112 --> 00:35:54,614
FROM ROTHSCHILD'S SEWAGE
AND SEPTIC SUCKING SERVICES

842
00:35:54,681 --> 00:35:57,584
REMINDING YOU WE'LL
TAKE PLENTY OF DOUGH IN

843
00:35:57,651 --> 00:36:00,754
BEFORE IT STARTS SNOWIN'
AND SANTA'S HO HO HO-IN'

844
00:36:00,821 --> 00:36:02,956
'CAUSE WE'RE SUCKING,
NOT BLOWING.

845
00:36:09,396 --> 00:36:10,830
OH, GEEZ.

846
00:36:10,864 --> 00:36:12,566
AH, FOR PETE SAKE.

847
00:36:12,632 --> 00:36:15,268
OH, YEAH, I WAS
SUPPOSED TO, UH,

848
00:36:15,302 --> 00:36:18,004
GIVE THIS PROGRAM SOME CLASS BY
READING A CHRISTMAS STORY,

849
00:36:18,071 --> 00:36:21,107
BUT I --

850
00:36:21,141 --> 00:36:23,977
LOST THE STUPID BOOK.

851
00:36:24,311 --> 00:36:27,847
ANYWAY, I'LL HAVE TO DO IT
FROM ANY MEMORY I HAVE LEFT.

852
00:36:27,914 --> 00:36:31,585
OKAY, THE STORY IS THE
GIFT OF THE MAGEE. (i.e. magi)

853
00:36:31,618 --> 00:36:35,855
IT'S WRITTEN BY A GUY WHO'S NAME
REMINDS ME OF A CHOCOLATE BAR,

854
00:36:35,889 --> 00:36:39,359
BABY RUTH OR PETER PAUL
MOUNDS OR SOMETHING.

855
00:36:39,426 --> 00:36:41,561
ANYWAY, QUITE
A WHILE AGO,

856
00:36:41,628 --> 00:36:44,364
THERE WAS THIS MAN AND THIS
WOMAN WHO WERE MARRIED.

857
00:36:44,397 --> 00:36:46,599
YOU KNOW, WHICH MEANS THEY
WEREN'T SHACKED UP
WITH HER FATHER,

858
00:36:46,633 --> 00:36:49,369
LIKE MY DAUGHTER AND HER
DO-NOTHING BOYFRIEND.

859
00:36:51,304 --> 00:36:52,806
ANYWAY, THIS MAN
AND THIS WOMAN,

860
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:54,441
THIS COUPLE WERE
VERY MUCH IN LOVE,

861
00:36:54,474 --> 00:36:55,742
BUT THEY KEPT IT
TO THEMSELVES, YOU KNOW.

862
00:36:55,809 --> 00:36:58,011
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO WATCH THEM
MAKING OUT ON THE COUCH

863
00:36:58,044 --> 00:36:59,746
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING
TO CLIP YOUR TOENAILS.

864
00:37:02,849 --> 00:37:04,651
ANYWAY, THIS COUPLE
WAS BROKE,

865
00:37:04,684 --> 00:37:06,653
AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO
GET EACH OTHER FOR CHRISTMAS,

866
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,422
SO, YOU KNOW, AT LEAST
THEY HAD THE DECENCY

867
00:37:09,456 --> 00:37:11,925
NOT TO GO TO HER FATHER AND
TRY TO MOOCH FOR A LOAN,

868
00:37:11,991 --> 00:37:13,360
WHICH I'LL
NEVER GET BACK!

869
00:37:15,095 --> 00:37:16,663
ON THE OTHER
HAND, YOU KNOW,

870
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:18,264
THEY WEREN'T THAT BRIGHT.

871
00:37:18,298 --> 00:37:21,134
SHE CUTS OFF ALL HER HAIR TO BY
HER GUY A WATCH CHAIN,

872
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:23,269
AND HE SELLS HIS WATCH
TO GET HER A DOODAD

873
00:37:23,336 --> 00:37:26,005
FOR THE HAIR SHE
DOESN'T HAVE ANYMORE.

874
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:28,108
THE END.

875
00:37:31,511 --> 00:37:35,682
ISN'T THAT JUST ABOUT THE MOST
DUMB AND PATHETIC STORY
YOU'VE EVER HEARD?

876
00:37:35,748 --> 00:37:38,718
OH, SURE, I KNOW IT'S SUPPOSED
TO MAKE YOU FEEL ALL
GOOEY INSIDE,

877
00:37:38,751 --> 00:37:40,820
REMIND YOU OF THE TRUE
SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS,

878
00:37:40,887 --> 00:37:44,124
WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, SPENDING A
LOT OF TIME AND MONEY,

879
00:37:44,157 --> 00:37:46,559
GETTING GIFTS FOR PEOPLE
THAT THEY DON'T NEED

880
00:37:46,626 --> 00:37:48,461
AND YOU CAN'T AFFORD.

881
00:37:48,495 --> 00:37:51,264
WELL, AT LEAST THAT SUMS UP
THE FESTIVE SPIRIT AROUND
OUR HOUSE.

882
00:37:52,432 --> 00:37:53,967
ANYWAY, MERRY CHRISTMAS,

883
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,735
AND I HOPE THIS STORY'S
TAUGHT YOU SOMETHING,

884
00:37:55,802 --> 00:37:57,904
LIKE, YOU KNOW, GO OUT AND BUY
YOURSELF SOMETHING NICE,

885
00:37:57,971 --> 00:38:00,139
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN
YOU'RE GONNA GO BROKE

886
00:38:00,206 --> 00:38:03,643
AND LOSE YOUR HAIR AND
HAVE TO SELL YOUR WATCH.

887
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:06,312
[ APPLAUSE ]

888
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:12,919
Red:  CHRISTMAS IS CUTLERY,

889
00:38:12,986 --> 00:38:14,587
SPECIAL KNIVES, ODD SPOONS,

890
00:38:14,621 --> 00:38:17,490
AND MORE FORKS THAN THE
ROAD TO THE LODGE,

891
00:38:17,557 --> 00:38:20,126
PLUS ALL KINDS OF SERVING
DOODADS THAT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN

892
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:22,528
LET ALONE USED,
IN ALMOST A YEAR.

893
00:38:22,595 --> 00:38:24,230
AND, OF COURSE, AS THE MAN,

894
00:38:24,264 --> 00:38:27,500
YOU'RE EXPECTED TO SURGICALLY
DISSECT THE TURKEY WITH
THESE TOOLS,

895
00:38:27,567 --> 00:38:30,069
WITH A BUNCH OF OTHER
TOOLS HECKLING YOU.

896
00:38:30,136 --> 00:38:32,839
THEY HAND YOU THE FANCY STEEL
KNIFE WITH THE BONE HANDLE

897
00:38:32,905 --> 00:38:35,241
THAT'S DULLER THAN
A BASEBALL BAT,

898
00:38:35,275 --> 00:38:39,312
FORCING YOU TO ASK YOUR GUEST
WHETHER THEY WANT WHITE
PULP OR DARK PULP.

899
00:38:39,379 --> 00:38:40,947
BUT MOST OF ALL,

900
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,649
CHRISTMAS IS
FINISHING YOR MEAL

901
00:38:42,715 --> 00:38:45,051
WITH A HALF DOZEN FORKS
AND SPOONS UNTOUCHED,

902
00:38:45,118 --> 00:38:49,589
WHILE YOU LICK THE MASHED
POTATOES OFF THE PALMS
OF YOUR HANDS.

903
00:38:51,858 --> 00:38:53,226
YOU KNOW,
AT CHRISTMAS TIME,

904
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:55,395
BY HEART KIND OF GOES
OUT TO THE LESS FORTUNATE.

905
00:38:55,461 --> 00:38:58,731
I'M TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE
WHO DON'T LIKE FRUITCAKE,

906
00:38:58,798 --> 00:39:01,534
AND I'M ONE OF 'EM.

907
00:39:01,601 --> 00:39:03,102
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU LOOK AT FRUITCAKE,

908
00:39:03,136 --> 00:39:04,404
THE WEIGHT OF IT
AND THE SIZE OF IT

909
00:39:04,437 --> 00:39:05,705
AND THE DIMENSIONS OF IT,

910
00:39:05,772 --> 00:39:07,807
IF YOU CAN GET
PAST THE GAG REFLEX,

911
00:39:07,874 --> 00:39:09,942
THERE ARE A LOT
OF THINGS YOU CAN DO

912
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:12,278
THAT ARE PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
OF THIS UNIT RIGHT HERE.

913
00:39:12,345 --> 00:39:13,646
LET ME SHOW
YOU A COUPLE.

914
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,081
HERE'S SOMETHING
DALTON DOES.

915
00:39:15,148 --> 00:39:17,717
HE SAVES UP ALL
OF HIS FRUITCAKES,

916
00:39:17,784 --> 00:39:21,187
AND HE GIVES 'EM
OUT AT HALLOWE'EN.

917
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,889
IT'S A LOT EASIER THAN JUST
TURNING THE LIGHTS OFF

918
00:39:22,955 --> 00:39:24,190
LIKE HE USED TO DO.

919
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,594
AWAY YOU GO.

920
00:39:28,861 --> 00:39:30,596
RANGER GORD,
ON CHRISTMAS EVE,

921
00:39:30,663 --> 00:39:33,232
HE USES HIS FRUITCAKE
AS A PILLOW.

922
00:39:33,299 --> 00:39:35,301
FRUITCAKE ON A FRUITCAKE.

923
00:39:36,836 --> 00:39:39,205
AND HERE'S GORD
ON CHRISTMAS DAY.

924
00:39:42,942 --> 00:39:46,279
NOW, WINSTON USES HIS
FRUITCAKE AS GOALIE PADS.

925
00:39:46,312 --> 00:39:48,814
I HOPE HE'S ALSO
WEARING A FRUIT CUP.

926
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,451
HERE'S SOMETHING YOU CAN DO.

927
00:39:52,485 --> 00:39:56,522
USE A FRUITCAKE AS A
POOR MAN'S CRUISE CONTROL.

928
00:39:56,856 --> 00:39:59,425
YOU CAN DO ABOUT 80 CLICKS
WITH THAT UNIT ON THERE.

929
00:39:59,492 --> 00:40:00,760
HERE'S DALTON AGAIN,

930
00:40:00,826 --> 00:40:02,428
SWITCHING SANTA'S
NORMAL TREAT

931
00:40:02,461 --> 00:40:05,064
FOR A BIG WAD OF FRUITCAKE.

932
00:40:05,097 --> 00:40:08,467
AND HERE'S DALTON'S STOCKING,
SHOWING SANTA GETTING EVEN.

933
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:15,207
YOU KNOW, FRUITCAKE HAS THE
SAME PROPERTIES OF WOOD,

934
00:40:15,274 --> 00:40:17,109
INCLUDING TASTE.

935
00:40:17,176 --> 00:40:19,178
YOU CAN KEEP A
STOVE GOING FOR HOURS.

936
00:40:19,211 --> 00:40:20,579
NOW, HERE'S SOMETHING.

937
00:40:20,613 --> 00:40:22,748
USE A PIECE OF FRUITCAKE
AS A LOVELY PARKING BRAKE.

938
00:40:24,717 --> 00:40:27,320
USE FRUITCAKE
AS A BOAT ANCHOR.

939
00:40:27,353 --> 00:40:28,788
IT DOESN'T FLOAT.

940
00:40:28,821 --> 00:40:30,623
NOW, HERE'S THE
BEST ONE YET.

941
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:33,225
YOU CAN LIFT FRUITCAKE TO GET
YOUR ARMS PUMPED UP

942
00:40:33,259 --> 00:40:34,460
RATHER THAN EATING IT

943
00:40:34,527 --> 00:40:36,329
AND GETTING YOUR
STOMACH PUMPED OUT.

944
00:40:38,964 --> 00:40:40,766
OR HIDE YOUR EXTRA
KEY UNDER A --

945
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:45,938
NOBODY'S GONNA
LOOK UNDER A FRUITCAKE.

946
00:40:45,971 --> 00:40:47,640
CHRISTMAS IS SUCH A GREAT
SEASON, YOU KNOW.

947
00:40:47,707 --> 00:40:49,175
PEOPLE, I THINK,
ARE ACTUALLY FRIENDLIER

948
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:50,743
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T
SEEM THE RIGHT TIME

949
00:40:50,776 --> 00:40:53,245
TO TELL OTHER PEOPLE
WHAT YOU THINK OF THEM.

950
00:40:53,312 --> 00:40:55,214
OH, RED, BOY,
I'M GLAD I CAUGHT YOU

951
00:40:55,247 --> 00:40:58,184
'CAUSE I'M HANDING OUT ALL
MY CHRISTMAS CARDS TO THE
LODGE MEMBERS THIS YEAR.

952
00:40:58,217 --> 00:40:59,752
YEAH, SAVING
MONEY ON STAMPS,
ARE YOU, DALTON?

00:40:59,819 --> 00:41:02,922

AND ENVELOPES.
OH, MAN.

954
00:41:02,988 --> 00:41:04,623

ME A MINUTE.

955
00:41:04,657 --> 00:41:06,325
I GOTTA FIND
WHICH ONE IS YOURS.

956

TOGETHER HERE.

959
00:41:11,931 --> 00:41:13,566
YEAH, YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT IS?

960
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,967
THAT'S WHITE OUT.

FEW CORRECTIONS ON IT.

HOW'D YOU MESS
THAT UP?

965
00:41:22,341 --> 00:41:24,210
NO, I HAD TO CORRECT
THE REST OF IT, RED,

966
00:41:24,276 --> 00:41:27,146
BECAUSE IT USED TO SAY
TO DALTON FROM ANN MARIE.

967
00:41:27,213 --> 00:41:31,016
AND THEN THERE WAS KIND OF
A MUSHY LITTLE LOVE POEM
ON THE OTHER SIDE THERE.

968
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:34,053

HAD TO WIPE THAT OUT.
