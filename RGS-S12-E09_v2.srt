00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:26,278
IS THAT EVERYTHING
HAS TO BE WRAPPED IN
A CYLINDRICAL SHAPE.

155
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:27,979
YOU KNOW, LIKE THIS
WINE BOTTLE

156
00:07:28,046 --> 00:07:29,614
OR A SLEEVE
OF TENNIS BALLS

157
00:07:29,648 --> 00:07:31,049
OR EVEN A ROLLING PIN.

158
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:32,751
AND EVEN IF IT'S
NOT THE RIGHT SHAPE,

159
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:35,120
AS LONG AS IT WILL FIT INSIDE,
SAY, ONE OF THESE
SHIPPING TUBES,

160
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:36,922
IT'S FINE.

161
00:07:36,988 --> 00:07:40,559
NOW YOU JUST WRAP
EVERYTHING UP GOOD AND SNUG.

162
00:07:40,592 --> 00:07:43,361
SMOOTH DOWN THE
OUTSIDE OF HER THERE.

163
00:07:43,428 --> 00:07:45,097
MAKE SURE
THEY'RE AIRTIGHT,

164
00:07:45,163 --> 00:07:47,332
KIND OF LIKE YOUR SLEEPING BAG
ON MEXICAN NIGHT.

165
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:52,003
OKAY, NOW, THE PIPE
ORGAN RUNS ON AIR,

166
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,439
SO YOU PUMP ON THE
PEDALS AND THE AIR GOES
THROUGH THE PIPES.

167
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:56,441
AND THAT'S PLENTY OF
AIR FOR MAKING MUSIC,

168
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:58,110
BUT FOR OUR PURPOSES,

169
00:07:58,176 --> 00:08:00,011
WE'RE GOING TO NEED SOMETHING
WITH A LITTLE MORE OOMPH.

170
00:08:00,078 --> 00:08:02,314
SO I'VE REPLACED THE PEDALS
WITH THIS HIGH-VOLUME

171
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,150
INDUSTRIAL AIR COMPRESSOR.

172
00:08:05,283 --> 00:08:07,819
OKAY, I'M NOT TOO SURE
HOW MUCH PRESSURE I NEED,

173
00:08:07,886 --> 00:08:10,989
SO I'M JUST GONNA
OPEN HER UP FULL.

174
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:13,391
THEN I'LL JUST BACK IT OFF
IF SOMETHING BREAKS.

175
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:20,866
NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS
MATCH OUR VARIOUS SIZED GIFTS

176
00:08:20,932 --> 00:08:25,804
WITH OUR VARIOUS
SIZED PIPES.

177
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,382
THEN WHEN YOU
PRESS DOWN ON A KEY,

178
00:08:37,415 --> 00:08:38,984
SEE, THE COMPRESSOR
WILL PLAY A NOTE

179
00:08:39,017 --> 00:08:40,785
AND FIRE THE GIFT
OUT TO THE RECIPIENT.

180
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:42,554
[ hits note ]

181
00:08:42,587 --> 00:08:44,389
[ glass breaking ]

182
00:08:44,422 --> 00:08:46,791
OKAY, UH, YOU MIGHT WANNA
GIVE THEM A BASEBALL GLOVE

183
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:49,194
OR A PILLOW CASE
TO CATCH IT IN.

184
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:50,895
AND MAKE SURE
GRANDPA'S AWAKE,

185
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:53,098
OR HE WON'T BE.

186
00:08:53,131 --> 00:08:55,900
AND NOW, OF COURSE,
YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE
TO GET THE MUSIC

187
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:57,936
AND THE GIFT GIVING OVER
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

188
00:08:57,969 --> 00:09:00,405
AND ISN'T THAT WHAT
CHRISTMAS IS ALL ABOUT?

189
00:09:00,438 --> 00:09:02,774
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

190
00:09:02,841 --> 00:09:04,509
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HAND --

191
00:09:04,576 --> 00:09:06,778
WELL, BY THE WAY, MAKE SURE
YOU PICK A PIECE OF MUSIC

192
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:08,880
THAT HITS ALL
THE RIGHT NOTES.

193
00:09:08,947 --> 00:09:13,084
HERE WE ARE: IT'S BEGINNING
TO LOOK A LOT LIKE CHRISTMAS.

YOU KNOW, I HOPE THEY'RE
STILL CALLING YOU THAT,

199
00:09:45,016 --> 00:09:47,152
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN SOME OF
YOUR PICTURES IN THOSE
TEEN MAGAZINES,

200
00:09:47,185 --> 00:09:49,354
AND -- WELL, I'M JUST
NOT SURE ANYMORE.

[ whistle ]
WOW!

202
00:09:51,523 --> 00:09:53,658
ANYWAY, AT THIS
JOYOUS TIME OF YEAR,

203
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:55,393
I'D LIKE YOU TO START
THINKING ABOUT THOSE

204
00:09:55,426 --> 00:09:57,595
WHO ARE LESS FORTUNATE
THAN YOURSELVES...

205
00:09:57,629 --> 00:09:59,330
ME.

206
00:09:59,664 --> 00:10:01,299
WHILE YOU'RE AT HOME
ALL SNUGGLED IN YOUR BED,

00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:03,168
WAITING FOR SANTA TO
COME DOWN THE CHIMNEY,

208
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:04,969
I'M UP HERE IN MY
FIRE WATCH TOWER

209
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:07,205
MAKING SURE THERE ARE
NO FOREST FIRES.

210
00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:11,009
WELL, BOYS AND GIRLS,
IT'S 40° BELOW ZERO.

211
00:10:11,075 --> 00:10:13,778
I'D KILL FOR A
FREAKIN' FOREST FIRE.

212
00:10:13,811 --> 00:10:15,547
BUT, OH, NO.

213
00:10:15,613 --> 00:10:19,551
AND THERE YOU ARE AT HOME
ALL SNUGLY AND WARM AND COZY

214
00:10:19,617 --> 00:10:22,654
SINGING CHRISTMAS CAROLS
AND EATING FIGGY PUDDING.

215
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,122
NOT ME.

216
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:27,525
I HAVE VERY LITTLE PUDDING
AND ABSOLUTELY NO FIGGY.

217
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:30,595
ON CHRISTMAS MORNING
YOU'LL WAKE UP TO GIFTS
UNDERNEATH THE TREE.

218
00:10:30,662 --> 00:10:33,631
OH, SURE, THE ANIMALS LEAVE
GIFTS FOR ME UNDERNEATH
THE TREES.

219
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:35,500
BUT THEY'RE VERY, VERY
SELDOM WRAPPED,

220
00:10:35,566 --> 00:10:38,169
AND THEY'RE NEVER
THE RIGHT SIZE.

221
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:40,171
NOW, DON'T GET ME WRONG,

FOR YOUR PITY.

I'M JUST KIDDING.
I AM LOOKING FOR YOUR PITY.

AND I'LL TEL YOU WHY...

225
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:49,414
BECAUSE EVERY
ONCE IN A WHILE,

226
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,582
YOU HAVE TO STOP THINKING
ABOUT YOURSELVES AND REALISE

227
00:10:51,616 --> 00:10:53,851
THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT
THERE THAT CARE ABOUT YOU,

228
00:10:53,885 --> 00:10:56,621
THAT ARE DOING THEIR LEVEL
BEST TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.

229
00:10:56,654 --> 00:10:58,690
SO HAVE A WONDERFUL
HOLIDAY SEASON,

230
00:10:58,723 --> 00:11:01,726
BUT REMEMBER:
IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU.

231
00:11:01,793 --> 00:11:03,995
IT'S ABOUT ME.

232
00:11:04,062 --> 00:11:06,197
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

233
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:08,566

( voice cracking )
LAUGHING ALL THE WAY

235
00:11:14,405 --> 00:11:16,207
I WAS JUST OVER AT MOOSE
THOMPSON'S HOUSE,

236
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,142
HELPING HIM GET INTO
HIS SANTA OUTFIT.

237
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:20,812
BY GOLLY,
HE IS A LARGE MAN.

238
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:22,880
YOU KNOW, IT'S
A STRETCHY MATERIAL,

239
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:24,749
SO WE COULD ACTUALLY GET
IT ON OVER HIS BUTT,

240
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:26,517
BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO GREASE THE INSIDE
OF THE SLEIGH,

241
00:11:26,584 --> 00:11:28,753
OR HE'LL HAVE TO STAND
FOR THE WHOLE PARADE.

UNCLE RED!

243
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:34,025
WOULD YOU TELL MR. HUMPHREY
THAT HIS OFFERING
IS NO GOOD?

244
00:11:34,058 --> 00:11:36,527
YOU WANT ME TO GIVE YOU
SOMETHING FREE

245
00:11:36,561 --> 00:11:38,329
SO THAT SANTA CAN
TOSS TREATS TO THE KIDS,

246
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:40,998
AND RED, THERE IS A
LIMIT TO WHAT I CAN DO.

247
00:11:41,065 --> 00:11:42,667
Red:
AND WHAT IS THAT
LIMIT, DALTON?

248
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:44,769
SEVEN CASES
OF PRUNES.

249
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,905
YEAH, BUT THEY'RE
PITTED PRUNES,

250
00:11:47,972 --> 00:11:50,141
SO NO ONE'S GONNA
LOSE AN EYE OR ANYTHING.

251
00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:52,109
WELL, DON'T YOU HAVE LITTLE
AIRPLANES OR STUFFED TOYS

252
00:11:52,176 --> 00:11:53,644
TO TOSS OUT
TO THE KIDS?

253
00:11:53,678 --> 00:11:55,680
WELL, YES, I DO.

254
00:11:55,746 --> 00:11:57,281
I SELL THEM.

255
00:11:57,348 --> 00:11:59,317
THAT'S HOW I
SUPPORT MYSELF.

256
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,086
AND THAT'S HOW I'M ABLE
TO GIVE THINGS AWAY
FOR FREE,

257
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:05,556
LIKE SEVEN CASES
OF PRUNES.

258
00:12:05,623 --> 00:12:07,592
OF COURSE,
IF YOU DON'T WANT THEM...

259
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,961
NO, NO, NO,
WE'LL TAKE 'EM.

260
00:12:10,027 --> 00:12:12,029
ALL RIGHT, I'LL LEAVE
'EM BESIDE THE SHED.

261
00:12:12,063 --> 00:12:13,598
GOOD.

262
00:12:13,664 --> 00:12:15,233
PRUNES?

263
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:17,101
GET OVER IT,
HAROLD, ALL RIGHT?

264
00:12:17,168 --> 00:12:19,470
I GOT SOME BAD
NEWS, RED.

265
00:12:19,503 --> 00:12:21,672
I COULD ONLY GET
FOUR REINDEER.

266
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:23,174
WELL, NO, THAT'S FINE.

267
00:12:23,207 --> 00:12:24,508
THAT'LL GET THE JOB DONE.
FOUR IS FINE.

268
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:26,510
NOT WITH MOOSE THOMPSON
IN THE SLEIGH.

269
00:12:26,544 --> 00:12:28,012
IN FACT, I WON'T
ALLOW IT.

270
00:12:28,045 --> 00:12:32,483
NO, NO, THERE'S NOTHING
MEANER THAN REINDEER
WITH A HERNIA.

271
00:12:35,553 --> 00:12:37,688
WELL, WHAT DO WE
DO NOW, GUYS?

272
00:12:37,755 --> 00:12:40,091
WELL, OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO
FIND SOMEBODY SMALLER
THAN MOOSE THOMPSON

273
00:12:40,157 --> 00:12:42,493
BUT WHO STILL LOOKS
LIKE SANTA CLAUS.

274
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:50,701
[ LAUGHTER ]

275
00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:55,439
Red (voice over):
NOW, ONE OF THE PARTS OF
OUR SANTA CLAUS PARADE FLOAT

276
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:58,242
WAS GOING TO BE OUR FROSTY
THE SNOWMAN DISPLAY.

277
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:00,011
SO WE ARE KEEPING
IT IN THE ARENA,

278
00:13:00,044 --> 00:13:01,379
WE DIDN'T
HAVE A LOT OF SNOW.

279
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:02,913
WALTER'S NOT GOOD ON ICE.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH --

280
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,915
OH, AND HE --

281
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:07,685
BUT HE SEEMS TO LIKE TO
TAKE WINSTON WITH HIM
WHEREVER HE GOES.

282
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:12,623
SO, UH, WINSTON DOES NOT HAVE
THE SENSE OF HUMOUR THAT
HE REALLY NEEDS.

283
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,926
THIS IS GOING
TO TAKE A WHILE.

284
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,828
ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO
IS GET FROSTY --

285
00:13:17,895 --> 00:13:20,064
NO, NO, NO.

286
00:13:20,131 --> 00:13:21,999
WELL, GREAT. OKAY.

287
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:24,435
SO NOW WE GOT
A HEADLESS FROSTY

288
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:26,737
WHICH MEANS WE NEED
SOME FRESH SNOW.

289
00:13:26,804 --> 00:13:28,906
SO THEY GOT
THE ZAMBONI THERE.

290
00:13:28,973 --> 00:13:30,875
I KNOW THESE THINGS,
WHAT THEY DO IS THEY
SCRAPE THE ICE,

291
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:33,377
AND ALL THE SNOW GOES
UP INTO A HOPPER,

292
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,613
AND I FIGURED WE COULD USE
THAT AS OUR SNOW SUPPLY,

293
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:38,782
AND THEN WE COULD MAKE
OURSELVES A NEW HEAD
FOR FROSTY ON THERE.

294
00:13:38,849 --> 00:13:41,118
GRAB A HANDFUL OF SNOW.

295
00:13:41,185 --> 00:13:43,187
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE
A NEW HEAD FOR FROSTY.

296
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,022
C'MON GET SOME SNOW THERE.

297
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:46,857
WATCH YOURSELF
THERE, WALTER.

298
00:13:46,924 --> 00:13:48,325
WALTER'S A LITTLE SHAKY.

299
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:50,094
BUT WINSTON'S STILL CARRYING
THE GRUDGE ON WALTER.

300
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:51,795
OF COURSE --

301
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:54,498
THAT'S NOT SO GOOD.

302
00:13:54,565 --> 00:13:56,667
WINSTON FINDS
THAT VERY FUNNY,

303
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,003
AND I'M THINKING YOU KNOW,

WALTER IS THREATEN HIM

BUT THE BROOM FLIES
THROUGH THE AIR,

HITS  THE CONTROLS
ON THE ZAMBONI,

309
00:14:09,947 --> 00:14:11,749
AND SHE STARTS
HEADING TOWARDS US.

310
00:14:11,782 --> 00:14:14,752
AT THIS POINT IT'S
EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF.

00:14:14,785 --> 00:14:17,054

AWAY ON THE ICE.

WHERE HE IS IN THIS.

IS JUST OPEN HER UP

OH, HE'S FINE.

AND MEANWHILE WINSTON IS
BACK WITH THE SNOW,

319
00:14:33,437 --> 00:14:35,673

A BRAND NEW HEAD

AND PUT FROSTY RIGHT BACK
THE WAY HE SHOULD BE.

BUT WINSTON FIGURED THAT
TO PROTECT FROSTY,

322

APPARENTLY IF YOU PUT
A LITTLE COATING OF WATER,
IT'LL FREEZE IT.

323
00:14:43,347 --> 00:14:46,150
PUT A NICE COATING
ON IT AND IT WON'T BE
SUSCEPTIBLE TO DAMAGES.

GONNA DO THAT.
