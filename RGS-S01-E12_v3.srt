DARES TO BREAK ALL THE RULES

00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:46,846
BUT APPEARS TO BE DIFFERENT,

8
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:47,680
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,015
BUDGET THAT OTHER SHOWS DO.

10
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:49,949
AND I THINK THAT'S PARTICULARLY

11
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:51,117
UNFAIR IF YOU ASK.

12
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:52,285
WELL, ANYWAY, THE POINT IS,

00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,120
IT'S THE RED GREEN SHOW.

00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:46,506
YOU COULD EVEN SAY HE'S WIRED.

I DO.

47
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:49,676
BUT, YOU KNOW, HE'S NOT JUST

48
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:50,543
PRODUCER AND DIRECTOR JUST

49
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:51,577
BECAUSE HE'S MY NEPHEW.

50

>> NO, THAT'S NOT IT, HAROLD.

57
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,055
IT'S BECAUSE YOUR FATHER PUT UP

51% OF THE MONEY TO DO THE SHOW

59

>> NOT IN THIS CASE, HAROLD.

>> YEAH.

122
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,600
WHOO, THERE WAS A WEEKEND.

123
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,748
>> THIS WEEK ON HANDYMAN CORNER,

124
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,416
WE'RE GONNA SHOW YOU HOW TO

125
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,751
FIX A LAWNMOWER.

126
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:13,752
WHEN YOU DO FIX A LAWNMOWER,

127
00:04:13,752 --> 00:04:14,920
THERE IS A CERTAIN ORDER THAT

128
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,455
YOU CHECK THINGS IN.

129
00:04:16,455 --> 00:04:18,124
NOW, THIS PARTICULAR MACHINE

130
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,792
HAS A SEIZED ENGINE.

131
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:20,960
SO THE FIRST THING YOU CHECK

132
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,295
IS THE PRICE OF A NEW ONE.

133
00:04:23,295 --> 00:04:24,630
AND THEN YOU CHECK THE I.Q.

134
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,966
OF THE LAST PERSON THAT USED IT.

135
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:27,967
AND YOU'LL FIND ONLY ONE OF

136
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,302
THOSE IS HIGH.

137
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:31,136
THE NEXT THING YOU CHECK IS

138
00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:32,104
THE SPARK PLUG.

139
00:04:32,104 --> 00:04:34,773
DISCONNECT THE PLUG.

140
00:04:34,773 --> 00:04:37,576
AND TAKE OUT THE SPARK PLUG.

141
00:04:42,314 --> 00:04:45,985
ADJUST THE GAP.

142
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:49,655
AND REINSTALL IT.

143
00:04:49,655 --> 00:04:50,823
AND WHILE YOU GOT THE GAS CAN

144
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,992
OPEN ANYWAY, YOU MIGHT AS WELL

145
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,660
CHECK TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY

146
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,629
EXCESS GAS IN THERE.

147
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,235
I GUESS NOT.

148
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:04,403
THE NEXT THING YOU MIGHT WANT

149
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:05,571
TO TAKE A LOOK AT IS THE BLADE

150
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:06,572
ITSELF.

151
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:07,740
WHAT YOU'RE CHECKING FOR HERE

152
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,577
IS NICKS AND BUMPS.

153
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:12,578
NO, THERE'S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH

154
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,546
OF THOSE.

155
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,584
THAT'S ABOUT IT.

156
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:19,585
I GUESS THE LAST STEP WHEN

157
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:20,452
YOU'RE CHECKING A LAWNMOWER

158
00:05:20,452 --> 00:05:22,287
WITH A SEIZED ENGINE IS TO KILL

159
00:05:22,287 --> 00:05:24,957
YOUR NEPHEW HAROLD.

160
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,625
SO UNTIL NEXT TIME, REMEMBER,

161
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:27,626
IF THE WOMEN DON'T FIND YOU

162
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:29,128
HANDSOME, THEY SHOULD AT LEAST

163
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,797
FIND YOU HANDY.

164
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:32,798
HAROLD, CAN I TALK TO YOU

165
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:36,135
FOR A MINUTE?

166
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,302
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE

167
00:05:37,302 --> 00:05:38,804
OF THE SHOW AND THE STORY OF

168
00:05:38,804 --> 00:05:39,805
THE OUTHOUSE.

169
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:40,973
>> BUT NOT HOPEFULLY AT THE

170
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:42,941
SAME TIME.

171
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:52,818
>> YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN WORKING

172
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:53,485
REALLY HARD ON THE SHOW.

173
00:05:53,485 --> 00:05:54,386
AND YOU PROBABLY NOTICED THAT,

174
00:05:54,386 --> 00:05:55,187
YOU KNOW, WITH THE DIRECTING

175
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:56,155
AND THE CUTTING-AWAYS AND THINGS

176
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:56,822
LIKE THAT.

177
00:05:56,822 --> 00:05:57,823
SO I THOUGHT--EMMY.

178
00:05:57,823 --> 00:05:59,491
WE'RE GONNA GET ONE FOR SURE.

179
00:05:59,491 --> 00:06:00,659
>> YOU MEAN AN AWARD?

180
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:01,660
>> AN AWARD FOR THE MOST

181
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,661
OUTSTANDING PRODUCTION IN

182
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:04,997
THE WOODS.

183
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:05,697
IS THAT A CATEGORY?

184
00:06:05,697 --> 00:06:06,365
THAT'S MY PROBLEM.

185
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,032
I DON'T KNOW.

186
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:07,933
>> I DON'T THINK THERE'D BE TOO

187
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:08,934
MANY IN THE CATEGORY.

188
00:06:08,934 --> 00:06:11,603
WHAT ABOUT BEST FOREIGN FEATURE

189
00:06:11,603 --> 00:06:13,939

190
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:16,775
DOCU-QUASI-COMEDY AND, UH,

191
00:06:16,775 --> 00:06:18,110
SPORTS SHOW?

192
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:18,944
>> WELL, THERE'S A LOT IN THAT

193
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:19,945
CATEGORY.

194
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:20,946
I THINK L.A. LAW

195
00:06:20,946 --> 00:06:21,780
IS IN THAT CATEGORY.

196
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,447
>> IS IT?

197
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:23,115
>> YEAH.

198
00:06:23,115 --> 00:06:23,949
IT'S A TOUGH COMPETITION.

199
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:25,951
THEY GOT MORE PEOPLE THAN US.

200
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:28,120
WE COULD BE BEST MUSICAL COMEDY

201
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,124
VARIETY SERIES IN A WOODED AREA.

202
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:33,125
>> THAT HAS A RING TO IT.

203
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,126
>> YEAH.

204
00:06:34,126 --> 00:06:35,527
THERE'S NOT A LOT IN THAT.

205
00:06:35,527 --> 00:06:36,361
NOW THAT YOGI BEAR'S BEEN

206
00:06:36,361 --> 00:06:37,196
CANCELED, WE'RE PRETTY MUCH

207
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:38,530
A SHOO-IN.

208
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,032
>> YOGI BEAR'S BEEN CANCELED?

209
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:42,000
>> HEARTBREAKER, ISN'T IT?

210
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:48,840
>> "IT IS WINTER.

211
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,176

00:06:51,176 --> 00:06:53,345
THE NORTH WIND BLOWS ALL NIGHT.

213
00:06:53,345 --> 00:06:54,680
BUT HERE, INSIDE, YOU'RE

FOR THE TOW TRUCK."

218
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:06,291
SO ANYWAYS, I WAS TRYING TO TELL

219
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,793
YOU A STORY ABOUT HOW THE LODGE

220
00:07:07,793 --> 00:07:09,962
GOT A NEW OUTHOUSE.

221
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,096
AND, WELL, IT STARTS WITH

222
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:12,931
A MISSING STICK OF DYNAMITE

223

ALL OF IT, HAROLD.

236
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:30,682
THEY DIDN'T GIVE IT THE FULL

237
00:07:30,682 --> 00:07:31,349
COVERAGE.

238
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:32,350
>> YEAH, WELL, IT WASN'T EXACTLY

239
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,351
THE KIND OF STORY THAT LENT

246
00:07:44,196 --> 00:07:45,030
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

247
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,198
TV NEEDS ACTION, UNCLE RED.

248
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:50,035

259
00:08:06,952 --> 00:08:07,953
THE RAILROAD.

00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:18,964
DID A LITTLE RAILROAD WORK.

266
00:08:18,964 --> 00:08:19,965
WE WERE TRYING TO FIND A NEW

THAT WORKING ON THE RAILROAD

270
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:26,037
WAS PRETTY TOUGH STUFF.

00:10:11,142 --> 00:10:12,143
AS FOLLOWS.

343
00:10:12,143 --> 00:10:14,979
"DEAR RED, CAN YOU DO ANYTHING

344
00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:17,982
ABOUT MY LAWN?"

345
00:10:17,982 --> 00:10:18,983
>> WELL, IS THERE ANY MORE

346
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:21,152
INFORMATION THAN THAT, HAROLD?

347
00:10:21,152 --> 00:10:22,320
>> OH, YEAH, OKAY.

348
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,154
ALL RIGHTY.

349
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:23,888
"CAN YOU DO ANYTHING

350
00:10:23,888 --> 00:10:24,889
ABOUT MY LAWN?

351
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:28,893
NAME WITHHELD."

352
00:10:28,893 --> 00:10:29,761
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S DIFFICULT TO

353
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:31,629
BE SPECIFIC IN THIS CASE.

354
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:33,464
BUT, YOU KNOW, GENERALLY, LAWN

355
00:10:33,464 --> 00:10:35,300
PROBLEMS RANGE ANYTHING FROM

356
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,968
WEED SPRAY TO SHOOTING YOUR

357
00:10:36,968 --> 00:10:38,303
NEIGHBOR'S DOG.

358
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:39,137
>> OH, YOU MEAN "SHOOING" THE

359
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:40,705
NEIGHBOR'S DOG, RIGHT?

360
00:10:40,705 --> 00:10:42,206
>> WELL, YOU CAN GIVE THAT A TRY

361
00:10:42,206 --> 00:10:44,542
FIRST, I GUESS.

362
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:46,210
FOR ME, PERSONALLY, NOW, I HAVE

363
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,212
AN ATTITUDE OF SURVIVAL OF

364
00:10:48,212 --> 00:10:49,047
THE FITTEST.

365
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:50,381
IF THE WEEDS WIN, HEY,

366
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:51,616
THEY DESERVE IT.

367
00:10:51,616 --> 00:10:53,117
>> OH, BUT NOBODY LIKES A LAWN

368
00:10:53,117 --> 00:10:54,786
FULL OF DANDELIONS, UNCLE RED.

369
00:10:54,786 --> 00:10:56,187
OR IS THAT JUST ME?

370
00:10:56,187 --> 00:10:56,954
>> I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH

371
00:10:56,954 --> 00:10:58,289
DANDELIONS.

372
00:10:58,289 --> 00:10:59,123
YOU CAN MAKE WINE FROM

373
00:10:59,123 --> 00:11:00,458
DANDELIONS, HAROLD.

374
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,794
YOU CAN'T MAKE WINE FROM SOD.

375
00:11:02,794 --> 00:11:04,295
MIND YOU, YOU CAN MAKE A SOD

376
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:05,129
FROM WINE.

377
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:06,130
LOOK AT OLD MAN SEDGEWICK.

378
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,298
>> [chuckles]

379
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:08,132
JEEZ, YOU NEVER THOUGHT LIKE

380
00:11:08,132 --> 00:11:09,100
THAT BEFORE.

381
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,101
YOU ALWAYS HAD A NICE LAWN,

382
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:11,269
I THOUGHT.

383
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:12,603
>> YEAH, BUT THAT WAS BEFORE

384
00:11:12,603 --> 00:11:14,105
SOMEBODY SEIZED UP MY LAWNMOWER

385
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:16,274
AND DIDN'T EVEN TELL ME.

386
00:11:16,274 --> 00:11:17,275
>> OH, YEAH.

387
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:19,610
WELL, MAYBE, MAYBE, UNCLE RED,

388
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,778
LIKE, THE OIL FILLER CAP

389
00:11:20,778 --> 00:11:21,946
IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND ON THAT

390
00:11:21,946 --> 00:11:22,780
MODEL.

391
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,448
YOU EVER THINK OF THAT?

392
00:11:23,448 --> 00:11:25,583
MAYBE THAT'S WHY, HUH?

393
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,551
>> WELL, HAROLD, THERE IS NO

394
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:27,718
OIL FILLER CAP.

395
00:11:27,718 --> 00:11:28,886
YOU MIX THE OIL RIGHT IN WITH

396
00:11:28,886 --> 00:11:30,121
THE GAS ON THAT ONE.

397
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:31,622
>> REALLY?

398
00:11:31,622 --> 00:11:33,791
OH, WELL, WHOEVER DID IT,

399
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,760
I'M SURE I'M SORRY.

400
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:39,997
>> TODAY ON ADVENTURES WITH

401
00:11:39,997 --> 00:11:41,165
BILL, BILL HAS A WHOLE TABLE

402
00:11:41,165 --> 00:11:42,500
FULL OF KNIVES THERE.

403
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,501
HE'S GONNA DO SOMETHING REAL

404
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:44,502
SPECIAL TONIGHT.

405
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:45,837
HE'S--OH!

406
00:11:45,837 --> 00:11:47,839
OH...

407
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,007
I GOT TO GET THOSE BRAKES

408
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:53,010
LOOKED AT ON THE VAN THERE.

409
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,011
I DON'T LIKE STOPPING ALL THAT

410
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:54,679
MUCH, ANYWAY.

411
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:55,513
I LIKE GOING.

412
00:11:55,513 --> 00:11:56,180
I'M MORE OF A GOER THAN

413
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,181
A STOPPER.

414
00:11:57,181 --> 00:11:58,516
ANYWAY, AS I SAY,

415
00:11:58,516 --> 00:12:00,017
BILL HAD THE KNIVES.

416
00:12:00,017 --> 00:12:01,185
AND WE GOT THE TABLE ALL SET UP.

417
00:12:01,185 --> 00:12:02,520
AND WE GOT THE KNIVES KIND OF

418
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,487
JAMMED INTO HER THERE.

419
00:12:03,487 --> 00:12:04,255
THAT'S THE WAY HE LIKES TO

420
00:12:04,255 --> 00:12:04,922
KEEP THEM.

421
00:12:04,922 --> 00:12:05,857
HE GOES THROUGH A LOT OF TABLES.

422
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:06,591
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE

423
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:08,092
DINNER ON THAT TABLE AFTERWARDS.

424
00:12:08,092 --> 00:12:09,927
YOUR SOUP KEEPS GETTING LOST

425
00:12:09,927 --> 00:12:11,596
DOWN TO YOUR LEGS, WHICH CAN

426
00:12:11,596 --> 00:12:13,764
HAPPEN.

427
00:12:13,764 --> 00:12:15,266
BUT HE'S GOT QUITE A COLLECTION

428
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:15,933
OF KNIVES.

429
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:17,435
AND WHAT--WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

430
00:12:17,435 --> 00:12:19,270
OH, OKAY.

431
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:19,937
BOY, OH, BOY.

432
00:12:19,937 --> 00:12:20,938
HE'S A DANGEROUS MAN, THAT BILL.

433
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:22,106
AND HE'S GOT THESE LEATHER

434
00:12:22,106 --> 00:12:22,940
STROPS HERE.

435
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,842
HE'S SHARPENING--NOW--WHAT?

436
00:12:24,842 --> 00:12:28,012
SOMETHING'S VERY, VERY BIZARRE

437
00:12:28,012 --> 00:12:32,016
ABOUT THAT STROP.

438
00:12:32,016 --> 00:12:33,184
ANYWAY, LIKE I SAY, BILL HAS

439
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:34,185
HIS OWN TECHNIQUES.

440
00:12:34,185 --> 00:12:36,354
AND I DON'T QUESTION THEM,

441
00:12:36,354 --> 00:12:37,521
'CAUSE ONCE I STARTED, I'D BE

442
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:38,522
THERE FOREVER.

443
00:12:38,522 --> 00:12:39,690
NOW HE'S GONNA PUT

444
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,826
THE TARGET UP.

445
00:12:45,296 --> 00:12:46,297
THIS WOULD BE A KNIFE HE SAW

446
00:12:46,297 --> 00:12:47,465
ADVERTISED ON TV MAYBE.

447
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:48,632
I DON'T KNOW.

448
00:12:48,632 --> 00:12:49,467
BUT HE'S GOT HER UP THERE.

449
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:51,802
AND HE BACKS OFF EXACTLY

450
00:12:51,802 --> 00:12:53,804
EIGHT STEPS.

451
00:12:53,804 --> 00:12:55,806
FIVE--OH.

452
00:12:55,806 --> 00:12:56,640
WELL, I GUESS WE'LL MAKE IT

453
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,308
FIVE.

454
00:12:57,308 --> 00:12:57,975
YEAH, FIVE.

455
00:12:57,975 --> 00:12:58,976
FIVE STEPS.

456
00:12:58,976 --> 00:13:00,478
AND HE'S ALL SET.

457
00:13:00,478 --> 00:13:01,645
HE GETS HIS FIRST KNIFE.

458
00:13:01,645 --> 00:13:03,647
AND WATCH THE WAY HE HANDLES

459
00:13:03,647 --> 00:13:04,315
THIS.

460
00:13:04,315 --> 00:13:06,817
THIS IS REALLY SOMETHING.

461
00:13:06,817 --> 00:13:11,822
AND HE CALLS THAT A PERFECT HIT.

462
00:13:11,822 --> 00:13:13,157
AND THAT WAS EITHER A HIGH-FIVE

463
00:13:13,157 --> 00:13:14,658
OR HE'S DRYING HIS DEODORANT.

464
00:13:14,658 --> 00:13:16,327
I'M NOT SURE.

465
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:18,162
AND THEY'RE BOTH ESSENTIAL.

466
00:13:18,162 --> 00:13:19,430
AND HERE HE GOES.

467
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,433
LOOK AT--OH.

468
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:23,934
YEAH, THAT CLOSE.

469
00:13:23,934 --> 00:13:26,270
YEAH, RIGHT, RIGHT.

470
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,272
BUT HE'S JUST FINDING THE RANGE.

471
00:13:28,272 --> 00:13:29,607
HE'S ACTUALLY VERY, VERY GOOD

472
00:13:29,607 --> 00:13:33,444
WITH KNIVES, AND...

473
00:13:33,444 --> 00:13:34,111
OH...

474
00:13:34,111 --> 00:13:36,113
[cow moos]

475
00:13:36,113 --> 00:13:37,114
LOOK OUT. LOOK OUT.

476
00:13:37,114 --> 00:13:39,450
OH, NICE CATCH.

477
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,619
BOY, OH, BOY, OH, BOY.

478
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:43,287
I THINK BILL WAS WITH THE CIRCUS

479
00:13:43,287 --> 00:13:44,455
FOR QUITE A WHILE.

480
00:13:44,455 --> 00:13:46,123
AND, YOU KNOW, HE SHOULD THINK

481
00:13:46,123 --> 00:13:48,959
ABOUT GOING BACK.

482
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,461
NOW I THINK HE'S GONNA--OH, NO.

483
00:13:50,461 --> 00:13:51,295
CLOSE.

484
00:13:51,295 --> 00:13:52,029
NOPE, NOPE.

485
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:54,832
OH, OH, OH, OH.

486
00:13:54,832 --> 00:13:57,167
I THOUGHT HE HAD THAT ONE.

487
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:58,669
SO HE WANTED ME TO GIVE IT

488
00:13:58,669 --> 00:14:02,840
A TRY.

489
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,174
NOT BAD.

490
00:14:04,174 --> 00:14:05,342
ANOTHER HIGH-FIVE THERE.

491
00:14:05,342 --> 00:14:07,511
AND I SHOWED HIM HOW TO DO IT.

492
00:14:07,511 --> 00:14:08,679
SO HE THOUGHT HE'D TRY AN

493
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:12,516
UNDERHAND.

494
00:14:12,516 --> 00:14:13,517
BEAUTY.

495
00:14:13,517 --> 00:14:14,652
BEAUTY, BEAUTY, BEAUTY.

496
00:14:14,652 --> 00:14:15,986
SUPER SHOT.

497
00:14:15,986 --> 00:14:17,488
THIS IS A STUNT, USING THE

498
00:14:17,488 --> 00:14:18,322
MIRROR.

499
00:14:18,322 --> 00:14:19,323
YOU LOOK AT THE--FIND THE TARGET

500
00:14:19,323 --> 00:14:20,491
IN THE MIRROR AND THEN

501
00:14:20,491 --> 00:14:22,793
THROW--BUT BILL GETS SOMETIMES

502
00:14:22,793 --> 00:14:25,629
CONFUSED ON HIS MOTOR SKILLS.

503
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:27,898
AND--OH.

504
00:14:27,898 --> 00:14:30,734
AND--UH-OH.

505
00:14:30,734 --> 00:14:32,369
[shattering]

506
00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:33,704
UH, WELL, I'D ALREADY SHAVED

507
00:14:33,704 --> 00:14:35,873
THIS YEAR ANYWAY.

508
00:14:35,873 --> 00:14:38,876
AND...

509
00:14:38,876 --> 00:14:42,379
AND WHERE IS IT?

510
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:43,647
NOW, THIS WAS A REAL MYSTERY

511
00:14:43,647 --> 00:14:45,149
FOR A WHILE.

512
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:46,316
JUST COULDN'T FIND THE KNIFE.

513
00:14:46,316 --> 00:14:48,485
CHECKED THE WHOLE AREA.

514
00:14:48,485 --> 00:14:50,154
CHECKED IN BEHIND THE SHED EVEN.

515
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:51,321
CHECKED EACH OTHER.

516
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:53,490
AND BILL--

517
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,159
DIDN'T THINK IT WAS IN MY BACK.

518
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:55,993
I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN.

519
00:14:55,993 --> 00:14:56,660
[air hissing]

520
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,661
OH, WE HEARD THAT.

521
00:14:57,661 --> 00:14:59,496
OH, OH, OH, OH, OH.

522
00:14:59,496 --> 00:15:02,833
OH, THERE'S THE KNIFE.

523
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,001
YEAH, THAT CLOSE, BILL.

524
00:15:04,001 --> 00:15:05,836
YEAH, RIGHT.

525
00:15:05,836 --> 00:15:07,805
YEAH, HERE'S A HIGH-FIVE.

526
00:15:10,908 --> 00:15:12,409
"IT IS WINTER.

527
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:13,911
ON A CHILLY, COLD NEW YEAR'S

528
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:15,746
DAY, AS I WALK THROUGH THE SNOW

529
00:15:15,746 --> 00:15:17,748
OUT BEHIND THE HOUSE, I MAKE

530
00:15:17,748 --> 00:15:19,750
A NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION.

531
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,751
THIS YEAR, WE'RE GETTING

532
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:22,719
INDOOR PLUMBING."

533
00:15:33,263 --> 00:15:36,033
>> YEAH?

534
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:37,701
>> ALL RIGHT, AT THIS POINT IN

535
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:38,836
THE SHOW, WE GIVE HAROLD

536
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:40,003
A CHANCE TO SAY A FEW WORDS.

537
00:15:40,003 --> 00:15:41,505
REMEMBER, LIFE DOESN'T ALWAYS

538
00:15:41,505 --> 00:15:42,840
MAKE SENSE.

539
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,007
GO AHEAD.

540
00:15:44,007 --> 00:15:45,175
>> PUBLIC SPEAKING.

541
00:15:45,175 --> 00:15:46,510
THE NUMBER ONE FEAR OF FEARS

542
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,178
IS SPEAKING IN PUBLIC.

543
00:15:48,178 --> 00:15:49,012
YEAH.

544
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:49,847
WELL, NOT LIKE THE PUBLIC

545
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:50,681
SPEAKING TO YOU.

546
00:15:50,681 --> 00:15:51,415
IT'S, LIKE, YOU KNOW, YOU

547
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:52,249
SPEAKING TO THE PUBLIC.

548
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:52,916
LIKE THAT.

549
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:53,917
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.

550
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:55,018
OKAY, FINE.

551
00:15:55,018 --> 00:15:56,520
WELL, I GOT A LITTLE TRICK FOR

552
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,521
YOU THAT OFTENTIMES

553
00:15:57,521 --> 00:15:59,122
PUBLIC-SPEAKING PEOPLE USE.

554
00:15:59,122 --> 00:16:00,457
THEY PICTURE THEIR AUDIENCE

555
00:16:00,457 --> 00:16:01,458
NAKED.

556
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,960
[chuckles]

557
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,961
BARE NAKED.

558
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:05,963
[chuckles]

559
00:16:05,963 --> 00:16:07,297
YOU KNOW, I DO THAT SOMETIMES

560
00:16:07,297 --> 00:16:08,465
EVEN WHEN I'M NOT SPEAKING IN

561
00:16:08,465 --> 00:16:09,633
PUBLIC.

562
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:10,634
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, IF YOU'RE

563
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:12,302
REALLY GOOD AT IT, YOU CAN

564
00:16:12,302 --> 00:16:15,305
PICTURE YOURSELF NAKED TOO.

565
00:16:15,305 --> 00:16:16,306
NEAT, HUH?

566
00:16:16,306 --> 00:16:17,307
THAT HELPS YOU GET RID OF ALL

567
00:16:17,307 --> 00:16:18,308
THE NERVOUSNESS.

568
00:16:18,308 --> 00:16:19,142
AND THEN YOU JUST FORGET

569
00:16:19,142 --> 00:16:20,978
EVERYTHING, INCLUDING WHAT

570
00:16:20,978 --> 00:16:21,979
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY.

571
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:22,813
SO WHAT DO YOU DO?

572
00:16:22,813 --> 00:16:23,981
THERE'S ANOTHER TRICK.

573
00:16:23,981 --> 00:16:25,315
YOU WRITE DOWN ALL THE WORDS ON

574
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:26,483
LITTLE 3x5 CARDS.

575
00:16:26,483 --> 00:16:27,317
THEN YOU WON'T FORGET.

576
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:28,151
AND THEY'RE RIGHT THERE.

577
00:16:28,151 --> 00:16:29,319
BUT HERE'S A HINT.

578
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:30,487
DON'T WRITE DOWN EXACTLY WHAT

579
00:16:30,487 --> 00:16:34,992
YOU WANT TO SAY, BECAUSE--OH.

580
00:16:34,992 --> 00:16:35,993
OH.

581
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:36,994
OOPS.

582
00:16:36,994 --> 00:16:38,662
I WASN'T GONNA TALK ABOUT

583
00:16:38,662 --> 00:16:39,496
PUBLIC SPEAKING.

584
00:16:39,496 --> 00:16:40,330
I WAS SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT

585
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,498
BUYING A CAR.

586
00:16:41,498 --> 00:16:44,835
[chuckles]

587
00:16:44,835 --> 00:16:46,503
>> WE DO AIM A LOT OF MATERIAL

588
00:16:46,503 --> 00:16:47,671
ON THIS SHOW TOWARDS TODAY'S

589
00:16:47,671 --> 00:16:49,339
TEENAGERS, BECAUSE OUR SPONSORS

590
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:50,841
REGARD THEM AS THE FUTURE OF

591
00:16:50,841 --> 00:16:51,842
THE COUNTRY.

592
00:16:51,842 --> 00:16:54,010
THAT'S PRETTY SCARY, ISN'T IT?

593
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,512
NOW I'M NOT A PREJUDICED PERSON.

594
00:16:55,512 --> 00:16:57,013
SO I'D JUST LIKE TO TALK TO ANY

595
00:16:57,013 --> 00:16:58,682
OF YOU TEENAGERS WHO ARE NOT,

596
00:16:58,682 --> 00:17:00,016
YOU KNOW, TOO DRUGGED-UP OR

597
00:17:00,016 --> 00:17:01,184
BOOZED-OUT OR IN A JUVENILE

598
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:03,186
DETENTION CENTER.

599
00:17:03,186 --> 00:17:04,521
I BELIEVE IN LIVE AND LET LIVE.

600
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:06,957
BUT WHAT IS WITH THOSE HAIRCUTS?

601
00:17:06,957 --> 00:17:08,125
SHAVED HALFWAY UP THE SIDE OR

602
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,127
MAYBE A LONG PIECE HANGING DOWN,

603
00:17:10,127 --> 00:17:11,628
OR YOU GOT THE INITIALS CARVED

604
00:17:11,628 --> 00:17:13,964
IN UP THERE, OR "THIS SIDE UP."

605
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:15,265
I MEAN, WHAT IS THAT?

606
00:17:15,265 --> 00:17:16,600
I'M NOT SAYING WHAT'S RIGHT

607
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,267
AND WHAT'S WRONG.

608
00:17:17,267 --> 00:17:18,935
BUT THAT LOOKS STUPID, OKAY?

609
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:20,437
AND IT LOOKS VIOLENT.

610
00:17:20,437 --> 00:17:21,438
I SAW A KID THE OTHER DAY.

611
00:17:21,438 --> 00:17:22,439
HE LOOKED SO VIOLENT, I WANTED

612
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,941
TO JUST SMACK HIM ONE.

613
00:17:24,941 --> 00:17:26,109
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

614
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,277
YOU'RE MAKING A STATEMENT ABOUT

615
00:17:27,277 --> 00:17:28,612
HOW YOU DON'T APPROVE OF ADULTS.

616
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:29,779
WELL, SO WHAT?

617
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:31,114
MAYBE YOU SHOULD LEARN TO BE

618
00:17:31,114 --> 00:17:32,282
MORE TOLERANT.

619
00:17:32,282 --> 00:17:34,117
AND SMARTEN UP.

620
00:17:34,117 --> 00:17:34,951
OTHERWISE, YOU'RE JUST GONNA

621
00:17:34,951 --> 00:17:38,288
END UP IN THE ARMY.

622
00:17:38,288 --> 00:17:40,123
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A LOT

623
00:17:40,123 --> 00:17:41,791
MORE OF OUR SPECIAL GUESTS

624
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,293
AND MORE OF OUR REGULAR FEATURES

625
00:17:43,293 --> 00:17:44,961
AND THE EXCITING CONCLUSION OF

626
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:46,463
THE OUTHOUSE STORY.

627
00:17:46,463 --> 00:17:47,464
>> THAT MIGHT BE ONE ITEM

628
00:17:47,464 --> 00:17:49,432
TOO MANY.

629
00:17:58,775 --> 00:17:59,609
>> THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD LUNCH

630
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:00,443
YOU MADE, UNCLE RED.

631
00:18:00,443 --> 00:18:02,112
>> OH, THANK YOU, HAROLD.

632
00:18:02,112 --> 00:18:02,946
>> WELL, WHAT WAS THAT ORANGE

633
00:18:02,946 --> 00:18:03,947
STUFF ON MY SANDWICH?

634
00:18:03,947 --> 00:18:06,449
>> WELL, THAT'S CHEESE.

635
00:18:06,449 --> 00:18:07,450
>> THAT'S NOT CHEESE.

636
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,618
>> THAT'S SOME KIND OF CHEESE.

637
00:18:08,618 --> 00:18:09,452
I'VE NEVER SEEN CHEESE LIKE

638
00:18:09,452 --> 00:18:10,287
THAT EITHER.

639
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:12,289
>> WHAT IS CHEESE?

640
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:13,290
>> WELL, NOW, THAT'S A GOOD

641
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,457
QUESTION.

642
00:18:14,457 --> 00:18:15,625
IT'S FROM A COW, ISN'T IT?

643
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:16,459
>> IT IS.

644
00:18:16,459 --> 00:18:17,794
I THINK MAYBE IT'S, LIKE, OLD--

645
00:18:17,794 --> 00:18:19,796
OLD PATS OF BUTTER.

646
00:18:19,796 --> 00:18:20,630
>> COULD BE.

647
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,398
>> PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER,

648
00:18:21,398 --> 00:18:22,232
AND YOU LEAVE THEM ON A COUNTER

649
00:18:22,232 --> 00:18:23,033
FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS, AND IT

650
00:18:23,033 --> 00:18:24,534
TURNS INTO CHEESE.

651
00:18:24,534 --> 00:18:25,368
>> WELL, WHERE DOES THE BUTTER

652
00:18:25,368 --> 00:18:26,102
COME FROM?

653
00:18:26,102 --> 00:18:27,103
I THOUGHT MAYBE FROM MILK.

654
00:18:27,103 --> 00:18:28,104
>> WELL, YOU HAVE TO LEAVE MILK

655
00:18:28,104 --> 00:18:29,439
OUT FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

656
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:30,774
>> SO CHEESE IS JUST--YOU'RE

657
00:18:30,774 --> 00:18:32,275
SAYING--MILK WITH PATIENCE.

658
00:18:32,275 --> 00:18:33,276
>> EXACTLY.

659
00:18:33,276 --> 00:18:34,277
AND IF YOU LEAVE IT OUT, IT'LL

660
00:18:34,277 --> 00:18:35,278
HAVE PENICILLIN,

661
00:18:35,278 --> 00:18:36,946
AND PATIENTS NEED PENICILLIN.

662
00:18:36,946 --> 00:18:37,614
>> PERFECT.

663
00:18:37,614 --> 00:18:38,448
>> YEAH.

664
00:18:38,448 --> 00:18:39,282
>> I ALWAYS THOUGHT CHEESE WAS

665
00:18:39,282 --> 00:18:41,117
KIND OF A URINE PRODUCT.

666
00:18:41,117 --> 00:18:43,086
BUT MAYBE THAT'S CHEEZ WHIZ.

667
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:46,423
JACK.

668
00:18:46,423 --> 00:18:49,592
JACK, COME ON UP HERE.

669
00:18:49,592 --> 00:18:51,728
I KNOW YOU'RE DOWN THERE, JACK.

670
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:56,266
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT?

671
00:18:56,266 --> 00:18:57,100
>> OH, NOTHING.

672
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,101
WE WERE JUST, YOU KNOW--THOUGHT

673
00:18:58,101 --> 00:18:59,102
WE'D DROP IN AND SEE HOW IT'S

674
00:18:59,102 --> 00:19:00,170
GOING; THAT'S ALL.

675
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,337
>> I'M FINE.

676
00:19:01,337 --> 00:19:02,005
I'M DOING FINE.

677
00:19:02,005 --> 00:19:02,672
>> ALL RIGHT.

678
00:19:02,672 --> 00:19:03,339
>> OH, YEAH.

679
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:05,675
YOU KNOW, I'M STRONG.

680
00:19:05,675 --> 00:19:06,342
>> YEAH.

681
00:19:06,342 --> 00:19:07,343
>> MY BODY'S STRONG.

682
00:19:07,343 --> 00:19:08,845
MY SPIRITS ARE STRONG.

683
00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:10,680
AND MY MIND IS STRONG, JACK.

684
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,514
>> NO, NO, YOU'RE JACK.

685
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:14,017
I'M RED.

686
00:19:14,017 --> 00:19:15,018
>> OKAY.

687
00:19:15,018 --> 00:19:15,852
SURE, FINE.

688
00:19:15,852 --> 00:19:17,353
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'M JUST--

689
00:19:17,353 --> 00:19:18,588
>> WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

690
00:19:18,588 --> 00:19:21,591
>> WELL, JACK, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE

691
00:19:21,591 --> 00:19:22,759
ARE--THEY REALLY RESPECT WHAT

692
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:23,760
YOU'RE DOING HERE, LIVING IN

693
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,561
THE CAVE, YOU KNOW.

694
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:26,896
BUT WE'RE KIND OF WONDERING WHY

695
00:19:26,896 --> 00:19:28,565
YOU'RE DOING THIS.

696
00:19:28,565 --> 00:19:31,067
>> WELL, THE END OF WESTERN

697
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:32,902
CIVILIZATION IS UPON US.

698
00:19:32,902 --> 00:19:34,704
I MEAN, LOOK AT ALL THE NUT BARS

699
00:19:34,704 --> 00:19:35,705
RUNNING AROUND.

700
00:19:35,705 --> 00:19:37,040
YOU KNOW, IT'S COMING.

701
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,542
AND I KNOW WHEN.

702
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:41,044
>> WELL, JACK, IF YOU KNOW WHEN,

703
00:19:41,044 --> 00:19:42,378
WHY DID YOU COME UP HERE

704
00:19:42,378 --> 00:19:44,547
SO EARLY?

705
00:19:44,547 --> 00:19:46,049
>> WHAT?

706
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:47,717
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

707
00:19:47,717 --> 00:19:49,052
IS THIS A TRICK?

708
00:19:49,052 --> 00:19:50,553
DON'T MAKE ME USE THIS, RED.

709
00:19:50,553 --> 00:19:51,888
>> NO, TAKE IT EASY, JACK.

710
00:19:51,888 --> 00:19:53,890
I'M JUST SAYING THAT IF YOU KNEW

711
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,391
EXACTLY WHEN THE WORLD WAS GONNA

712
00:19:55,391 --> 00:19:57,560
END, THEN WHY WOULD YOU COME UP

713
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,896
HERE A YEAR AND A HALF EARLY,

714
00:19:59,896 --> 00:20:01,731
YOU KNOW, TO LIVE IN A DARK,

715
00:20:01,731 --> 00:20:03,566
DINGY, WET CAVE?

716
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:04,400
YOU KNOW, IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE

717
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,902
ANY SENSE TO ME.

718
00:20:05,902 --> 00:20:08,905
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

719
00:20:08,905 --> 00:20:13,576
>> I KNOW--I KNOW ROUGHLY WHEN.

720
00:20:13,576 --> 00:20:15,578
ROUGHLY.

721
00:20:15,578 --> 00:20:17,413
AND I WANTED TO GET SETTLED IN.

722
00:20:17,413 --> 00:20:18,414
>> ALL RIGHT.

723
00:20:18,414 --> 00:20:19,582
ALL RIGHT, I'LL BUY THAT.

724
00:20:19,582 --> 00:20:20,583
I'LL BUY THAT.

725
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,418
SO WHAT EXACTLY IS YOUR PLAN,

726
00:20:22,418 --> 00:20:24,420
JACK?

727
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,254
>> PLAN?

728
00:20:25,254 --> 00:20:25,922
>> YEAH.

729
00:20:25,922 --> 00:20:26,923
WELL, YOU MUST HAVE A PLAN.

730
00:20:26,923 --> 00:20:27,924
I MEAN, A GUY DOESN'T LEAVE HIS

731
00:20:27,924 --> 00:20:29,092
HOME AND HIS FAMILY AND WALK

732
00:20:29,092 --> 00:20:30,259
AWAY FROM A GOOD-PAYING JOB IN

733
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:32,428
AN ADVERTISING AGENCY, YOU KNOW,

734
00:20:32,428 --> 00:20:33,596
WALK AWAY FROM EVERYTHING HE

735
00:20:33,596 --> 00:20:35,098
OWNS AND EVERYTHING HE KNOWS

736
00:20:35,098 --> 00:20:36,766
TO COME AND LIVE IN A CAVE.

737
00:20:36,766 --> 00:20:37,934
HE DOESN'T DO THAT UNLESS HE HAS

738
00:20:37,934 --> 00:20:41,104
A REALLY GOOD PLAN, YOU KNOW.

739
00:20:41,104 --> 00:20:42,105
>> HE DOESN'T?

740
00:20:42,105 --> 00:20:43,940
>> DOES HE?

741
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,941
>> DOES HE?

742
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:46,609
UH, NO.

743
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:47,443
>> NO.

744
00:20:47,443 --> 00:20:48,611
>> NO, HE DOESN'T.

745
00:20:48,611 --> 00:20:50,113
IT'S CRAZY TO DO THAT.

746
00:20:50,113 --> 00:20:50,947
>> RIGHT.

747
00:20:50,947 --> 00:20:55,284
SO WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

748
00:20:55,284 --> 00:20:57,120
>> WELL, YOU KNOW,

749
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,789
THIS AND THAT.

750
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:00,957
I'M PLAYING IT BY EAR.

751
00:21:00,957 --> 00:21:02,125
>> OH.

752
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,292
>> A PLAN ISN'T GONNA BE MUCH

753
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:04,293
GOOD WHEN THE WORLD COMES TO

754
00:21:04,293 --> 00:21:05,128
AND END, IF YOU KNOW WHAT

755
00:21:05,128 --> 00:21:06,129
I'M SAYING, AND IT'S COMING.

756
00:21:06,129 --> 00:21:06,963
>> YEAH.

757
00:21:06,963 --> 00:21:07,964
>> YOU KNOW, WITH THE COLD WAR,

758
00:21:07,964 --> 00:21:09,298
THE BOMBS, THE POLLUTION,

759
00:21:09,298 --> 00:21:11,133
THE TAXES.

760
00:21:11,133 --> 00:21:12,301
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, JACK,

761
00:21:12,301 --> 00:21:14,303
THE COLD WAR IS OVER.

762
00:21:14,303 --> 00:21:15,304
AND THEY GOT RID OF A LOT OF

763
00:21:15,304 --> 00:21:15,972
THE BOMBS.

764
00:21:15,972 --> 00:21:16,706
A LOT OF THE COUNTRIES ARE

765
00:21:16,706 --> 00:21:17,540
DISARMING NOW.

766
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,708
AND I THINK JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY

767
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,042
IS WORKING ON THE ENVIRONMENT,

768
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:20,710
GETTING RID OF ALL THAT

769
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,545
POLLUTION.

770
00:21:22,545 --> 00:21:23,212
>> OH?

771
00:21:23,212 --> 00:21:26,382
>> YEAH.

772
00:21:26,382 --> 00:21:29,886
>> SO WESTERN CIVILIZATION

773
00:21:29,886 --> 00:21:31,554
ISN'T COMING TO AN END?

774
00:21:31,554 --> 00:21:32,555
>> I DON'T THINK SO, NO.

775
00:21:32,555 --> 00:21:35,391
SORRY.

776
00:21:35,391 --> 00:21:37,727
>> WELL, I GUESS THE WORLD

777
00:21:37,727 --> 00:21:40,229
AS WE KNOW IT ISN'T THE WORLD

778
00:21:40,229 --> 00:21:41,897
AS WE KNOW IT, JACK.

779
00:21:41,897 --> 00:21:42,565
>> NO, NO.

780
00:21:42,565 --> 00:21:43,399
YOU'RE JACK.

781
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:44,066
I'M RED.

782
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:46,902
>> I'M TALKING TO MYSELF.

783
00:21:46,902 --> 00:21:48,904
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, JACK?

784
00:21:48,904 --> 00:21:50,072
MAYBE WHEN EVERYBODY HEARD YOU

785
00:21:50,072 --> 00:21:51,741
WERE LIVING UP HERE IN THE CAVE,

786
00:21:51,741 --> 00:21:52,575
IT BROUGHT THEM ALL

787
00:21:52,575 --> 00:21:53,909
TO THEIR SENSES.

788
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:54,710
YOU KNOW, IT'S POSSIBLE.

789
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,444
IT MIGHT'VE HAPPENED.

790
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:56,145
>> YEAH?

791
00:21:56,145 --> 00:21:56,812
>> YEAH, IT COULD'VE.

792
00:21:56,812 --> 00:21:57,647
>> IT COULD?

793
00:21:57,647 --> 00:21:58,314
>> YEAH.

794
00:21:58,314 --> 00:21:58,981
>> IT COULD'VE?

795
00:21:58,981 --> 00:21:59,682
>> YEAH.

796
00:21:59,682 --> 00:22:00,883
>> WELL, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

797
00:22:00,883 --> 00:22:02,885
THAT WAS MY PLAN.

798
00:22:02,885 --> 00:22:03,619
>> IT WAS?

799
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:04,286
>> DON'T YOU SEE--

800
00:22:04,286 --> 00:22:05,621
WELL, HOW COULD YOU SEE?

801
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:06,622
DON'T FEEL BAD.

802
00:22:06,622 --> 00:22:07,957
THE PLAN WAS SO CLEVER,

803
00:22:07,957 --> 00:22:09,125
IT FOOLED THE GREATEST MINDS

804
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,126
OF OUR TIME.

805
00:22:10,126 --> 00:22:10,960
>> OH, MY GOD.

806
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,794
>> SEE, I KNEW THAT IT WOULD

807
00:22:11,794 --> 00:22:13,229
END THE COLD WAR.

808
00:22:13,229 --> 00:22:13,896
>> ALL RIGHT.

809
00:22:13,896 --> 00:22:14,897
>> YOU KNOW, I KNEW THEY'D

810
00:22:14,897 --> 00:22:15,631
DISARM.

811
00:22:15,631 --> 00:22:16,532
I KNEW THEY'D START TO CLEAN UP

812
00:22:16,532 --> 00:22:17,366
THE ENVIRONMENT.

813
00:22:17,366 --> 00:22:18,100
I KNEW THEY'D GET RID OF

814
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,934
THE TAXES.

815
00:22:18,934 --> 00:22:20,269
>> OH, NO.

816
00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:22,405
NO, JACK, THEY STILL HAVE TAXES.

817
00:22:22,405 --> 00:22:23,239
>> WHAT?

818
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:27,076
>> YEAH.

819
00:22:27,076 --> 00:22:29,045
>> DARN.

820
00:22:30,579 --> 00:22:32,548
>> THE MAN'S A GENIUS.

821
00:22:37,286 --> 00:22:39,121
ALL RIGHT, SO ANYWAYS, I WANTED

822
00:22:39,121 --> 00:22:40,956
TO FINISH UP THE STORY ABOUT

823
00:22:40,956 --> 00:22:42,625
THE OUTHOUSE BLOWING UP.

824
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,794
WELL, OLD MAN SEDGEWICK HAD BEEN

825
00:22:44,794 --> 00:22:46,128
STUFFING HIMSELF ALL DAY WITH

826
00:22:46,128 --> 00:22:47,463
PRUNES AND BEETS.

827
00:22:47,463 --> 00:22:49,465
>> UNCLE RED, I MEAN, OKAY,

828
00:22:49,465 --> 00:22:50,466
I KNOW IT'S YOUR SHOW AND

829
00:22:50,466 --> 00:22:51,133
EVERYTHING.

830
00:22:51,133 --> 00:22:52,001
BUT I THINK THE OUTHOUSE STORY

831
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:53,669
IS JUST A CHEAP LAUGH.

832
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:54,670
I MEAN, I'M THINKING ABOUT OUR

833
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,005
AUDIENCE, YOU KNOW?

834
00:22:56,005 --> 00:22:57,506
I MEAN, BEFORE THEY COMPLETELY

835
00:22:57,506 --> 00:22:58,841
EVAPORATE, MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST

836
00:22:58,841 --> 00:23:00,509
CONSIDER THEM FOR A MOMENT.

837
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:02,278
WHAT ABOUT THE MORE MODERN,

838
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:03,279
INTELLIGENT VIEWER?

839
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:04,513
THEY'RE MATURE.

840
00:23:04,513 --> 00:23:05,381
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE GETTING BACK

841
00:23:05,381 --> 00:23:06,882
TO EARTH THESE DAYS.

842
00:23:06,882 --> 00:23:08,551
WELL, HOW ABOUT YOURSELF?

843
00:23:08,551 --> 00:23:09,385
WEREN'T YOU WORKING ON, LIKE,

844
00:23:09,385 --> 00:23:11,554
A COMPOST HUMUS DISTRIBUTION

845
00:23:11,554 --> 00:23:12,588
SYSTEM?

846
00:23:12,588 --> 00:23:13,923
>> YEAH, WELL, THAT WAS THE

847
00:23:13,923 --> 00:23:17,092
OUTHOUSE BLOWING UP STORY.

848
00:23:17,092 --> 00:23:20,262
THANKS FOR RUINING IT.

849
00:23:20,262 --> 00:23:22,431
ALL RIGHT, WELL, IF MY WIFE IS

850
00:23:22,431 --> 00:23:23,766
WATCHING, I'M GONNA BE COMING

851
00:23:23,766 --> 00:23:24,934
STRAIGHT HOME AFTER THE SHOW.
