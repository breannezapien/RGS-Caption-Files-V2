36
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,463
OF THAT BUNGEE JUMPING

37

JOCKSTRAP ONTO YOUR ANKLE

39
00:01:39,565 --> 00:01:41,167
AND HEAVE YOU OFF A BRIDGE

40
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:42,602
YOU KNOW AND THEN THE BLOOD

41
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,636
ALL RUSHES TO YOUR HEAD

42
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:44,671

AND IT MAKES YOU FEEL

44
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:46,639
YOUNG AGAIN APPARENTLY.

45
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,074
>>HAROLD: YOU KNOW ACTUALLY

46
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:48,941
THAT BUNGEE JUMPING IS NOT SAFE

47
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:49,909
AND IT'S BEEN BANNED IN A LOT

48
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:54,847
OF AREAS, CEMENT AREAS I THINK.

49
00:01:54,847 --> 00:01:55,815
>>RED: WELL OF COURSE WE CAN'T

50
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:57,116
AFFORD THE REAL OFFICIAL BUNGEE

51
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:58,284
JUMPING GEAR OR ANYTHING,

52
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,285
BUT JUNIOR SINGLETON GOT

53
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,420
THE IDEA THAT IF YOU CLIMB

54
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,587
TO THE TOP OF A REAL SPRINGY

55
00:02:01,587 --> 00:02:02,955
TREE LIKE YOU KNOW A WILLOW

56
00:02:02,955 --> 00:02:05,058
OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW,

57
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,125
AND YOU SAY YOU TIE YOUR

58
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,493
FOOT OFF TO THE TOP BRANCH

59
00:02:07,493 --> 00:02:08,361
AND THEN YOU JUST DIVE

60
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:09,228
IT'S GOT TO BE THE SAME

61
00:02:09,228 --> 00:02:12,865
AFFECT REALLY.

62
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:13,566

63
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:14,400
TO BE A PRETTY GOOD IDIOT

64
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,203
TO DO THAT.

65
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:18,070
>>RED: WELL THANKS FOR

102
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:21,467
THIS WEEK ON

103
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:22,368
'HANDYMAN CORNER' WE'RE GOING

104
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,269
TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING THAT

105
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:24,337
YOU CAN DO WITH THAT OLD WRECK

106
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,237
OF A CAR THAT YOU MAY HAVE

107
00:03:25,237 --> 00:03:25,972
SITTING OUT ON YOUR

108
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:26,973
FRONT LAWN SAY OR PERHAPS

109
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,908
WEDGED INTO THE GARDEN SHED.

110
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:29,875
NOW UP HERE AT THE LODGE

111
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:30,943
OF COURSE WHEN A CAR GETS

112
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:32,311
TOO DANGEROUS TO DRIVE

113
00:03:32,311 --> 00:03:33,312
WE JUST SELL IT

114
00:03:33,312 --> 00:03:39,518
TO ANOTHER MEMBER.

115
00:03:39,518 --> 00:03:41,053
BUT WHAT DO YOU DO

116
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:41,921
WHEN A CAR LITERALLY

117
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:42,755
FALLS TO PIECES?

118
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:46,492
SELL IT AS A KIT CAR.

119
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:55,534
(CRASHING & BANGING)

120
00:03:55,534 --> 00:03:56,669
NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD

121
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:57,737
SEE THIS AS A BIG PILE OF

122
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,738
CRAP AND FIGURE, WELL THIS

123
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,472
IS NO LONGER A VIABLE

124
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,707
MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION,

125
00:04:01,707 --> 00:04:04,610
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOT ME.

126
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:11,183
I LOOK AT THIS STUFF AND

127
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:12,218
I SAY WITH A LITTLE ELBOW

128
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,353
GREASE AND SOME IMAGINATION

129
00:04:14,353 --> 00:04:15,588
I CAN BUILD MYSELF

130
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:24,163
A FREE 10-SPEED BICYCLE.

131
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:24,997
GOLLY IF THE MOTOR HADN'T

132
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:25,731
OF SEIZED UP I COULD

133
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:27,800
BUILT A MOPED.

134
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,801
ALL RIGHT THE FIRST THING

135
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:29,735
YOU NEED IS TO MAKE YOURSELF

136
00:04:29,735 --> 00:04:31,237
A 2-WHEEL BICYCLE,

137
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,439
OF COURSE IT'S 2 WHEELS.

138
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,540
I GOT 4 TO CHOOSE FROM

139
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,674
SO I THREW THE 2 UGLY ONES

140
00:04:35,674 --> 00:04:37,076
AWAY AND I GOT HAROLD'S

141
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:37,977
TOOTHBRUSH AND CLEANED

142
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:38,944
ALL THE ROAD KILL OUT

143
00:04:38,944 --> 00:04:43,482
OF THE THREADS OF THESE.

144
00:04:43,482 --> 00:04:44,450
BUT YOU WANT TO MAKE

145
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,117
SURE THAT THERE'S NO

146
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:46,051
LEAKS IN THESE THINGS,

147
00:04:46,051 --> 00:04:47,152
SO WHAT YOU DO IS YOU TAKE

148
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:49,154
THE TIRE AND JUST STICK HER

149
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:51,023
DOWN INTO A BUCKET OF WATER

150
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:52,124
AND WATCH FOR THE BUBBLES

151
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:54,059
COMING TO THE SURFACE,

152
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:55,961
SORT OF LIKE OLD MAN SEDGEWICK

153
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:57,963
IN POSSUM LAKE, I'LL JUST STICK

154
00:04:57,963 --> 00:05:00,332
THAT DOWN THERE AS EASY AS PIE.

155
00:05:00,332 --> 00:05:01,700
IT'S A LITTLE SMALL FOR THE,

156
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,105
(WATER SPLASHING OUT)

157
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:06,805
ALL RIGHT, WELL WE'LL ASSUME

158
00:05:06,805 --> 00:05:08,841
THERE'S NO LEAKS THERE.

159
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:09,608
NOW I'M GOING TO NEED TO

160
00:05:09,608 --> 00:05:13,879
MAKE A FRAME FOR THE BICYCLE,

161
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:14,546
BY GOLLY THIS WILL WORK

162
00:05:14,546 --> 00:05:15,547
RIGHT HERE, THE EXHAUST

163
00:05:15,547 --> 00:05:17,983
SYSTEM OUT OF THE UNIT

164
00:05:17,983 --> 00:05:32,398
THAT SHOULD BE FINE.

165
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:33,399
BOY MAKE NO WONDER GAS

166
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,968
STATIONS ARE SO MESSY,

167
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:37,469
ALL RIGHT TAKE A HACKSAW

168
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:38,737
AND YOU WANT TO START

169
00:05:38,737 --> 00:05:39,805
HACKING THIS THING UP,

170
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:42,074
YOU'LL NEED 3 2-FOOT LENGTHS

171
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:43,375
AND 2 3-FOOT LENGTHS,

172
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,245
SO THAT'S 3-2'S AND 2-3'S

173
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:52,351
WHICH IS A FULL HOUSE I BELIEVE.

174
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:57,623
BY GOLLY, BOY HACKSAWS ARE

175
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:04,696
FRAGILE THINGS AREN'T THEY?

176
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:05,931
ALL RIGHT, SO ONCE YOU

177
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:07,866
GOT YOUR PIPE CUT YOU GOT

178
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:09,201
ENOUGH PIECES NOW TO START

179
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:12,371
BUILDING YOUR FRAME.

180
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:13,472
YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT JUST WANT

181
00:06:13,472 --> 00:06:14,339
TO FILE THOSE EDGES A LITTLE

182
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:15,274
SMOOTHER ESPECIALLY IF YOU

183
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:18,343
RIDE YOUR BIKE IN SHORTS.

184
00:06:18,343 --> 00:06:19,144
NOW TO PUT ALL THE PIECES

185
00:06:19,144 --> 00:06:20,045
TOGETHER YOU COULD USE

186
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:21,647
STOVE BOLTS OR YOU COULD

187
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:24,483
A WELDING TORCH OR YOU

188
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:25,450
COULD USE THAT'S RIGHT,

189
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,886
THE HANDYMAN SECRET WEAPON,

190
00:06:27,886 --> 00:06:37,696
DUCT TAPE.

191
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:38,297
YOU GOT ANOTHER ROLL

192
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:42,501
THERE HAROLD.

193
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:44,436
AND THERE YOU HAVE IT,

194
00:06:44,436 --> 00:06:46,138
AND IF THAT ISN'T A REAL HEAD

195
00:06:46,138 --> 00:06:48,006
TURNER OF A BICYCLE FRAME

196
00:06:48,006 --> 00:06:49,441
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

197
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:50,242
NOW THIS MUFFLER IS

198
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:51,476
A DANDY PLACE TO HOLD

199
00:06:51,476 --> 00:06:53,145
WATER FOR YOU LONG DISTANCE

200
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:55,047
RIDERS WHO CAN'T HOLD YOUR WATER

201
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:55,948
AND YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING

202
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,182
TO YOURSELF, WHAT AM

203
00:06:57,182 --> 00:07:00,419
I GOING TO USE FOR PEDALS?

204
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,021
NOW HERE WE GO,

205
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:07,159
HOW ABOUT WINDOW WINDERS?

206
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:08,860
AND THEN FOR A CHAIN I'LL,

207
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,695
NOT MUCH OF A...

208
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,964
OH HERE WE GO, HERE WE ARE

209
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:13,231
WE'LL JUST RUN A FAN BELT FROM

210
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:14,433
THE PULLEY UP TO ANOTHER PULLEY

211
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:15,334
AND THERE WE GO THERE,

212
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,601
AND AS FAR AS THE GEARS

213
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:19,805
GO AND WHATEVER....

214
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:21,673
HERE'S YOUR FULL GEARS,

215
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:22,541
THERE'S GEARS EVERYWHERE

216
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,308
IN A CAR, THAT'S NOT

217
00:07:23,308 --> 00:07:24,109
GOING TO BE A PROBLEM,

218
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:25,077
YOU SEE THE SECRET IS TO

219
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:26,878
MAKE DO WITH WHAT YOU HAVE,

220
00:07:26,878 --> 00:07:28,680
THIS IS NOT JUST RECYCLING,

221
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,684
IT'S BI-CYCLING.

222
00:07:32,684 --> 00:07:33,819
SO I'LL GET THIS ALL RIGGED

223
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:34,686
TOGETHER BUT IT'S GOING

224
00:07:34,686 --> 00:07:35,487
TO TAKE A LITTLE WHILE,

225
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:36,388
WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK TO

226
00:07:36,388 --> 00:07:37,589
THE SHOW AND WHEN I GOT HER

227
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:38,924
ALL DONE I'LL HAVE YOU COME

228
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:39,858
BACK IN HERE AND I GET TO

229
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:43,395
DO A LITTLE SHOWING OFF.

230
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:50,368
>>HAROLD: AND NOW IT'S THAT

231
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:51,169
PART OF THE SHOW WHERE WE

232
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:52,003
EXPOSE THE 3 LITTLE WORDS

233
00:07:52,003 --> 00:07:53,705
THAT MEN FIND SO HARD TO SAY,

234
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:57,075
'I DON'T KNOW'.

235
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:58,276
AND HERE NOW IS THE EXPERT,

236
00:07:58,276 --> 00:07:59,177
MY UNCLE RED AND OF COURSE

237
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:01,179
HIS GOOD FRIEND,

238
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:02,314
MR. HAP SHAUGHNESSY,

239
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:11,423
LOCAL FISHERMAN AND RACONTEUR.

240
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:13,124
ALL RIGHTY, 'DEAR EXPERTS,

241
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:13,892
THERE'S A GUY AT WORK

242
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:15,327
THAT DRIVES US ALL CRAZY,

243
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:16,261
WHENEVER HE TELLS YOU SOMETHING

244
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:17,462
IT'S SO FULL OF LIES AND

245
00:08:17,462 --> 00:08:18,396
EXAGGERATIONS THAT YOU

246
00:08:18,396 --> 00:08:19,931
CAN'T BELIEVE ANY OF IT,

247
00:08:19,931 --> 00:08:24,903
WHAT'S WITH THIS GUY?'

248
00:08:24,903 --> 00:08:25,637
>>RED: WELL HAP THIS SOUNDS

249
00:08:25,637 --> 00:08:29,941
LIKE IT'S MORE IN YOUR AREA.

250
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:30,942
>>HAP: WELL IT'S A SELF

251
00:08:30,942 --> 00:08:34,479
CONFIDENCE PROBLEM ISN'T IT?

252
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,415
PEOPLE WHO STRETCH THE TRUTH

253
00:08:37,415 --> 00:08:38,216
ARE GENERALLY TRYING TO MAKE

254
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:39,150
THEMSELVES MORE IMPORTANT

255
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,652
THAN THEY REALLY ARE,

256
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:41,720
YOU KNOW JUST TO MAKE UP

257
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,490
FOR THEIR POOR SELF IMAGE.

258
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,358
>>HAROLD: WELL THAT'S

259
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:47,058
VERY INSIGHTFUL.

260
00:08:47,058 --> 00:08:47,892
>>HAP: YEAH, THAT'S WHAT

261
00:08:47,892 --> 00:08:50,895
SIGMUND FREUD TOLD ME,

262
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:52,831
BUT THE VERY WORST

263
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:53,898
BRAGGER AND BOASTER

264
00:08:53,898 --> 00:08:54,966
THAT I EVER MET WAS ON ONE

265
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:57,936
OF OUR CLIMBS UP EVEREST.

266
00:08:57,936 --> 00:08:59,704
WE HAD 7 ATTEMPTS

267
00:08:59,704 --> 00:09:01,806
ALL OF THEM WERE SUCCESSFUL

268
00:09:01,806 --> 00:09:02,674
BUT YOU SHOULD OF HEARD THIS GUY

269
00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:03,675
AND THE STORIES THAT CAME OUT

270
00:09:03,675 --> 00:09:07,879
OF HIS MOUTH, SPACE EXPEDITION,

271
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,681
RUNNING THE 2 MINUTE MILE,

272
00:09:09,681 --> 00:09:11,116
PLAYING BILLIARDS WITH THE POPE,

273
00:09:11,116 --> 00:09:11,883
I HAPPEN TO KNOW THE POPE

274
00:09:11,883 --> 00:09:16,054
ONLY PLAYS STRIPES AND SOLIDS.

275
00:09:16,054 --> 00:09:17,155
BUT THIS GUY GOT TO ME SO

276
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:19,557
MUCH I HAD TO LEAVE THE TENT,

277
00:09:19,557 --> 00:09:20,291
I HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE

278
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,060
AND SLEEP ON THE GLACIER

279
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,261
BETTER TO RISK ANOTHER ENCOUNTER

280
00:09:23,261 --> 00:09:24,696
WITH THE ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN

281
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:25,530
THAN TO SPEND ANY MORE

282
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,665
TIME WITH THIS MAN.

283
00:09:27,665 --> 00:09:28,400
>>RED: YEAH I KNOW WHERE

284
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,269
YOU'RE COMING FROM THERE HAP.

285
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:33,271
>>HAP: BUT OF COURSE I DIDN'T

286
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:36,107
EXPECT THE AVALANCHE,

287
00:09:36,107 --> 00:09:38,576
350,000 TONS OF SNOW

288
00:09:38,576 --> 00:09:39,911
CLEAVED OFF THAT MOUNTAIN

289
00:09:39,911 --> 00:09:43,982
AND LANDED RIGHT ON THAT KNEE,

290
00:09:43,982 --> 00:09:46,985
THE BAD KNEE.

291
00:09:46,985 --> 00:09:48,119
WELL I WANTED TO SCREAM

292
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:48,920
BUT SOME OF THE CREW WERE

293
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,221
STILL SLEEPING,

294
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:51,523
SO I QUIETLY JUST TRIED TO DIG

295
00:09:51,523 --> 00:09:53,958
MYSELF OUT OF IT AND AFTER A

296
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,294
FEW HOURS I CAME UPON THIS GUY,

297
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:58,062
THIS SAME GUY LYING

298
00:09:58,062 --> 00:09:59,597
THERE UNCONSCIOUS, HIS HEAD

299
00:09:59,597 --> 00:10:02,033
STUCK IN AN ICE CREVICE,

300
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:03,234
AND I HAD A 7 POUND PICK WITH ME

301
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:05,003
AND I COULD OF CHIPPED HIM

302
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:05,870
OUT BUT I COULDN'T GUARANTEE

303
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:10,441
HE'D STILL HAVE EARS.

304
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:11,075
>>RED: WELL RIGHT NOW I WOULD

305
00:10:11,075 --> 00:10:16,848
ENVY SOMEONE WITHOUT EARS.

306
00:10:16,848 --> 00:10:17,916
>>HAP: SO I TRIED THIS LITTLE

307
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,217
TRICK THAT I LEARNED DURING

308
00:10:19,217 --> 00:10:22,620
THE WAR FROM DE GAULLE,

309
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,925
I MELTED THE GUY OUT OF THERE

310
00:10:26,925 --> 00:10:27,859
YOU KNOW WITH A POT OF HOT

311
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:31,663
COFFEE AND A TURKEY BASTER.

312
00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:32,630
>>RED: AND HOW ABOUT YOUR

313
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,198
SELF CONFIDENCE HAP,

314
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:34,999
DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE

315
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:38,636
A POOR SELF IMAGE?

316
00:10:38,636 --> 00:10:40,571
>>HAP: USE TO,

317
00:10:40,571 --> 00:10:43,508
BEFORE I WAS KNIGHTED.

318
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:45,944
>>RED: DON'T ASK HIM HAROLD.

319
00:10:47,478 --> 00:10:48,713
IT IS SPRING,

320
00:10:48,713 --> 00:10:49,614
THE BEARS EMERGE

321
00:10:49,614 --> 00:10:51,015
FROM HIBERNATION

322
00:10:51,015 --> 00:10:53,251
DESPERATE FOR COHABITATION

323
00:10:53,251 --> 00:10:54,152
THE BIRDS FLY HOME

324
00:10:54,152 --> 00:10:55,553
TO MATE AND NEST,

325
00:10:55,553 --> 00:10:56,587
THE SALMON RETURN

326
00:10:56,587 --> 00:10:58,356
TO SPAWN AND REST,

327
00:10:58,356 --> 00:10:59,157
THE DEER COME BACK

328
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:00,792
TO RUT AND ROAM,

329
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:01,959
WHAT I'M SAYING IS

330
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:04,595
HI HONEY I'M HOME!

331
00:11:05,963 --> 00:11:07,031
>>RED: AND THERE YOU HAVE IT

332
00:11:07,031 --> 00:11:08,132
SHE'S PRETTY WELL ALL

333
00:11:08,132 --> 00:11:09,167
RIGGED UP, LOOKING PRETTY

334
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:10,134
GOOD ISN'T IT?

335
00:11:10,134 --> 00:11:13,337
GOT THE HORN ON HERE,

336
00:11:13,337 --> 00:11:14,639
I CALL THAT THE MATTERHORN

337
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,408
BECAUSE IT'S A MOUNTAIN BIKE.

338
00:11:17,408 --> 00:11:18,676
AND I PUT REFLECTORS ALL OVER

339
00:11:18,676 --> 00:11:20,278
THE BACK AND SO FORTH SO YOU

340
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:21,212
CAN DO SOME NIGHT RIDING,

341
00:11:21,212 --> 00:11:22,346
AND I'VE GOT THE LIGHT

342
00:11:22,346 --> 00:11:23,281
ON THE FRONT HERE,

343
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:24,182
AND REMEMBER THE OLD-FASHION

344
00:11:24,182 --> 00:11:25,216
GENERATORS YOU USE TO HAVE

345
00:11:25,216 --> 00:11:26,617
ON YOUR BIKE, WELL I JUST,

346
00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:28,486
ACTUALLY THAT ONE IS AN

347
00:11:28,486 --> 00:11:30,154
ALTERNATOR BUT SHE'S PRETTY

348
00:11:30,154 --> 00:11:31,189
WELL SET TO GO,

349
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:32,256
I GOT A LITTLE WIND INDICATOR

350
00:11:32,256 --> 00:11:33,124
RIGHT UNDER THE SEAT,

351
00:11:33,124 --> 00:11:34,826
IT MAKES SENSE,

352
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:35,660
AND LET'S JUST TAKE

353
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,061
HER FOR A SPIN.

354
00:11:37,061 --> 00:11:39,130
(LOUD SIZZLE)

355
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,198
OKAY THAT MUFFLER'S STILL

356
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:40,965
A LITTLE BIT WARM,

357
00:11:40,965 --> 00:11:42,467
GOT TO WATCH FOR THAT,

358
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:43,968
AT LEAST WE'VE LEARNED

359
00:11:43,968 --> 00:11:44,669
THERE'S SOMETHING,

360
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:52,877
I'LL JUST CLIMB RIGHT UP.

361
00:11:52,877 --> 00:11:53,778
AND ALL RIGHT,

362
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:54,545
WELL I'M GOING TO TAPE

363
00:11:54,545 --> 00:11:55,646
A FEW THINGS UP AND MAYBE

364
00:11:55,646 --> 00:11:56,514
I NEED ANOTHER COUPLE OF ROLLS

365
00:11:56,514 --> 00:11:57,582
OF DUCT TAPE AND I'LL

366
00:11:57,582 --> 00:12:00,918
TAKE CARE OF THAT,

367
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:02,687
MAYBE THIN OUT THE FRAME AND

368
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:06,691
WHAT HAVE YOU AND FIX HER ALL UP

369
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:07,458
AND I THINK SHE'LL LOOK QUITE

370
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,192
A BIT DIFFERENT BY THE TIME

371
00:12:08,192 --> 00:12:10,661
I DO THIS PROPERLY.

372
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:13,197
IT'S ONE OF THOSE

373
00:12:13,197 --> 00:12:14,398
I'LL JUST...CUT!

374
00:12:14,398 --> 00:12:15,566
AND THAT'S ALL IT TAKES,

375
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:16,801
THAT LITTLE EXTRA TIME AND

376
00:12:16,801 --> 00:12:18,135
EFFORT AND I'VE MADE THIS

377
00:12:18,135 --> 00:12:19,470
INTO REALLY A LOVELY 10-SPEED

378
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,439
BIKE THAT COINCIDENTALLY

379
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:23,040
LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE HAROLD'S

380
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,941
BIKE THAT'S HOW GOOD OF

381
00:12:23,941 --> 00:12:25,576
A JOB I'VE DONE EH?

382
00:12:25,576 --> 00:12:26,577
RIGHT DOWN TO THE NAME

383
00:12:26,577 --> 00:12:27,445
ON IT AND EVEN THE DENTS,

384
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:28,246
IT'S JUST AMAZING

385
00:12:28,246 --> 00:12:30,081
I'M PRETTY PROUD OF THAT.

386
00:12:30,081 --> 00:12:31,682
ANYWAY REMEMBER IF THE WOMEN

387
00:12:31,682 --> 00:12:33,217
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

388
00:12:33,217 --> 00:12:34,685
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST

389
00:12:34,685 --> 00:12:36,454
FIND YOU HANDY.

390
00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:37,188
HAROLD WE'VE TRADED

391
00:12:37,188 --> 00:12:38,322
BIKES BY THE WAY,

392
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:39,290
HAROLD, HAROLD, HAROLD?

393
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,293
(LOUD CRASH)

394
00:12:45,563 --> 00:12:47,698
>>RED: WELL AS IT TURNS OUT

395
00:12:47,698 --> 00:12:49,200
THE DIAMETER OF THE TREE

396
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,335
AND THE SPRINGINESS DIDN'T TURN

397
00:12:51,335 --> 00:12:52,603
OUT TO BE NEARLY AS IMPORTANT

398
00:12:52,603 --> 00:12:57,375
AS SAY THE STRENGTH OF THE ROPE.

399
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,342
>>HAROLD: WHAT HAPPENED TO

400
00:12:58,342 --> 00:12:59,877
THE REST OF THE ROPE?

401
00:12:59,877 --> 00:13:01,245
>>RED: WELL A LOT OF IT

402
00:13:01,245 --> 00:13:02,480
IS STILL TANGLED AROUND THE

403
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,647
TOP OF THE TREE AND THE REST

404
00:13:03,647 --> 00:13:04,782
IS KIND OF KNOTTED AROUND

405
00:13:04,782 --> 00:13:09,453
MOOSE'S NETHER REGIONS.

406
00:13:09,453 --> 00:13:11,222
>>HAROLD: BOY THAT MUST OF

407
00:13:11,222 --> 00:13:12,256
REALLY HURT WHEN MOOSE HIT

408
00:13:12,256 --> 00:13:13,290
THE GROUND BECAUSE

409
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,527
HE'S A BIG EATER.

410
00:13:16,527 --> 00:13:17,128
>>RED: YEAH HE'S

411
00:13:17,128 --> 00:13:20,064
A BIG FALLER TOO.

412
00:13:20,064 --> 00:13:21,966
HE WAS DOING A SWAN DIVE

413
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:22,967
THERE AND I BELIEVE HE'D BE

414
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:23,934
HITTING ABOUT A MOCK 4

415
00:13:23,934 --> 00:13:26,704
WHEN HE STRUCK PAY DIRT,

416
00:13:26,704 --> 00:13:27,738
LUCKILY HE LANDED ON THAT PILE

417
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:28,906
OF SCRAP IRON AND BRICKS

418
00:13:28,906 --> 00:13:29,974
WE HAD LEFT,

419
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:30,775
REMEMBER THE PROPANE

420
00:13:30,775 --> 00:13:31,542
TANK WENT UP?

421
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:32,576
YEAH, SO THAT KIND OF

422
00:13:32,576 --> 00:13:34,779
BROKE HIS FALL BUT HE HIT

423
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:35,913
SO HARD THAT HE ACTUALLY

424
00:13:35,913 --> 00:13:40,050
CRACKED THE EARTH'S CRUST.

425
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:40,951
>>HAROLD: IS THE PLANET

426
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:42,019
GOING TO BE OKAY?

427
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:42,887
>>RED: OH YEAH

428
00:13:42,887 --> 00:13:43,854
IT'LL HEAL HAROLD.

429
00:13:43,854 --> 00:13:44,855
BUT YOU KNOW WHEN WE STOPPED

430
00:13:44,855 --> 00:13:45,656
LAUGHING AND SO ON,

431
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:46,790
WE WENT OVER TO HIM AND

432
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,226
WE ROLLED HIM OVER AND THERE

433
00:13:49,226 --> 00:13:50,327
WAS LIKE AN UNDERGROUND

434
00:13:50,327 --> 00:13:53,164
CAVERN THERE.

435
00:13:53,164 --> 00:13:54,331
>>HAROLD: A GROTTO?

436
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:57,434
>>RED: WELL HE WAS FOR AWHILE

437
00:13:57,434 --> 00:13:58,569
BUT WE LOOKED CLOSER AND

438
00:13:58,569 --> 00:13:59,837
IT WASN'T JUST A CAVERN,

439
00:13:59,837 --> 00:14:01,906
IT WAS AN ABANDONED MINE.

440
00:14:01,906 --> 00:14:02,940
>>HAROLD: A MINE?

441
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,974
>>RED: YEAH.

442
00:14:03,974 --> 00:14:04,708
>>HAROLD: THIS IS EXCELLENT!

443
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:05,576
THAT'S GREAT, WHAT WAS IT

444
00:14:05,576 --> 00:14:06,510
LIKE A GOLD MINE

445
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,545
OR A PLATINUM MINE?

446
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:08,579
A PLATINUM CAN BE A DIAMOND MINE

447
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:09,680
A DIAMOND MINE WE'D BE RICH,

448
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,082
IF WE HAD DIAMONDS WE'D BE RICH

449
00:14:12,082 --> 00:14:12,850
IT COULD BE A DIAMOND MINE,

450
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,451
THIS IS EXCITING!

451
00:14:14,451 --> 00:14:15,252
>>RED: YEAH AND TO THINK IT

452
00:14:15,252 --> 00:14:15,953
ALL STARTED WITH SOMETHING

453
00:14:15,953 --> 00:14:18,088
AS HARMLESS AS TREE DIVING.

'ADVENTURES WITH BILL'

468
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:47,985
HE INVITED ME TO COME DOWN

469
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:49,420
AND HAVE A LITTLE PICNIC

470
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,387
OUT BEHIND THE LODGE,

471
00:14:50,387 --> 00:14:51,255
WHICH I THOUGHT WE WERE

472
00:14:51,255 --> 00:14:52,222
GOING TO GET SOME

473
00:14:52,222 --> 00:14:53,257
ICE-CREAM CONES THERE,

474
00:14:53,257 --> 00:14:55,759
SO I LOVE ICE CREAM

475
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:57,294
BUT IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL DAY

476
00:14:57,294 --> 00:14:58,162
AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING,

477
00:14:58,162 --> 00:14:59,063
I JUST NEED A HOT SUMMER DAY

478
00:14:59,063 --> 00:15:02,966
TO OH, OH, OH, ALL RIGHT,

479
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:03,867
WELL I DON'T THINK

480
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:05,202
I WAS THAT LATE,

481
00:15:05,202 --> 00:15:06,470
WELL LUCKILY I HAD SOMEWHERE

482
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,838
TO CLEAN MY HAND OFF ANYHOW

483
00:15:07,838 --> 00:15:11,608
AND SOME BUTTER THERE

484
00:15:11,608 --> 00:15:12,342
AND ALL RIGHT,

485
00:15:12,342 --> 00:15:13,310
NOW AT THIS POINT WE'RE

486
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:16,080
STARTING TO GET SOME ICE CUBES

487
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,047
AND, YES, YES I SEE, I THINK

488
00:15:17,047 --> 00:15:17,915
WHAT BILL IS TRYING TO SAY HERE

489
00:15:17,915 --> 00:15:21,351
IS THAT THE SUN MELTS STUFF.

490
00:15:21,351 --> 00:15:23,921
AND NOW BILL APPARENTLY WAS

491
00:15:23,921 --> 00:15:24,788
GOING TO TEACH ME SOME HIGHLY

492
00:15:24,788 --> 00:15:26,490
SECRET SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES

493
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:30,861
WHICH IS HOW YOU CAN MAKE

494
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:34,131
A REFRIGERATOR

495
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:35,532
BOY, OUT IN THE WOODS.

496
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:36,400
OKAY HE PUTS ALL OF THE STUFF

497
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,935
THAT HE WANTS TO KEEP COOL

498
00:15:37,935 --> 00:15:39,837
INSIDE THERE AND CLEANS

499
00:15:39,837 --> 00:15:40,704
OFF THE TABLE, OH MY GOSH,

500
00:15:40,704 --> 00:15:41,605
AND NOW THAT'S,

501
00:15:41,605 --> 00:15:42,472
IT'S LIKE A POTATO BAG,

502
00:15:42,472 --> 00:15:45,776
BURLAP BAG, OH, OH,

503
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:46,610
IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE,

504
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:47,544
I COULD HAVE BEEN STANDING

505
00:15:47,544 --> 00:15:48,478
OVER THERE.

506
00:15:48,478 --> 00:15:50,047
AND THEN YOU THREAD THE

507
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:51,548
ROPE UP THROUGH HERE,

508
00:15:51,548 --> 00:15:52,416
AND NOW THIS IS REAL

509
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,217
INTERESTING BECAUSE WHAT

510
00:15:53,217 --> 00:15:54,017
YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS

511
00:15:54,017 --> 00:15:55,052
YOU'RE GOING TO COVER UP

512
00:15:55,052 --> 00:15:55,986
ALL THAT STUFF,

513
00:15:55,986 --> 00:15:56,853
PUT THE THING RIGHT OVER

514
00:15:56,853 --> 00:15:57,854
THE TOP OF IT AND THAT KEEPS IT,

515
00:15:57,854 --> 00:15:58,689
AND I FIGURE OKAY,

516
00:15:58,689 --> 00:15:59,756
THAT'S THE SHADE,

517
00:15:59,756 --> 00:16:00,591
YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP

518
00:16:00,591 --> 00:16:01,625
THIS IN THE SHADE, BUT OH NO, NO

519
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,260
YOU HANG IT UP IN A TREE SO

520
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,828
THAT THE ANIMALS I GUESS CAN'T

521
00:16:04,828 --> 00:16:05,696
GET IT AND WHAT HAVE YOU.

522
00:16:05,696 --> 00:16:06,863
AND NOW TO KEEP IT COOL

523
00:16:06,863 --> 00:16:08,899
YOU NEED SOME SORT OF A,

524
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:11,268
WELL LUCKILY HE HAD A PIE

525
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:13,403
PLATE IN HIS PANTS THERE,

526
00:16:13,403 --> 00:16:14,304
AND THEN HE JUST, WOW!

527
00:16:14,304 --> 00:16:15,439
HE'S USING ONE OF MY,

528
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:16,673
HOW DID THAT?

529
00:16:16,673 --> 00:16:17,574
OH WELL, HE'S USING THAT

530
00:16:17,574 --> 00:16:19,776
AS KIND OF A WICK THING,

531
00:16:19,776 --> 00:16:21,144
AND THEN HE PUTS WATER IN

532
00:16:21,144 --> 00:16:21,845
THE PLATE AND I THINK IT'S

533
00:16:21,845 --> 00:16:22,813
CALLED CAPILLARY ACTION

534
00:16:22,813 --> 00:16:23,580
THAT TAKES THE WATER

535
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,617
DOWN THROUGH THE,

536
00:16:27,617 --> 00:16:28,385
WELL BILL, NO, NO, NO,

537
00:16:28,385 --> 00:16:29,453
THAT'S GRAVITY ACTION.

538
00:16:29,453 --> 00:16:31,288
ANYWAY AND THAT KEEPS

539
00:16:31,288 --> 00:16:32,255
IT COOL, THE WATER

540
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,090
EVAPORATES OR SOMETHING,

541
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,024
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS BUT

542
00:16:34,024 --> 00:16:37,928
APPARENTLY IT WORKS REAL WELL.

543
00:16:37,928 --> 00:16:39,196
OH WELL, I THINK IT'S NOT

544
00:16:39,196 --> 00:16:40,130
ALL THAT WELL AND HERE'S

545
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:40,964
ANOTHER THING,

546
00:16:40,964 --> 00:16:41,865
THIS IS A BAG THAT'S GOT

547
00:16:41,865 --> 00:16:42,666
ALL HOLES IN IT, A MESH BAG,

548
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:43,600
HE SHOULDN'T OF GOT HIS FINGERS

549
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,568
IN THERE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING

550
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:45,736
TO TRY TO PUT SOME OF THE POP,

551
00:16:45,736 --> 00:16:49,873
THE SODA IN, OH, OH, OH, OH!

552
00:16:49,873 --> 00:16:50,941
ALL RIGHT, WELL BILL'S COOLED

553
00:16:50,941 --> 00:16:54,411
ALREADY SO IT'S WORKING.

554
00:16:54,411 --> 00:16:55,212
AND HE PUTS ALL THE CANS

555
00:16:55,212 --> 00:16:56,079
OF SODA POP IN THERE

556
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,013
AND TAKE THEM DOWN,

557
00:16:57,013 --> 00:16:58,849
AND THE IDEA HERE IS YOU TIE

558
00:16:58,849 --> 00:17:00,383
A ROPE TO IT AND YOU THROW IT

559
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:02,886
OUT INTO THE LAKE YOU KNOW

560
00:17:02,886 --> 00:17:03,720
WHERE'S IT'S COOLER AT

561
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,288
THE BOTTOM AND SO ON,

562
00:17:05,288 --> 00:17:06,022
AND ACTUALLY IT SHOULD BE,

563
00:17:06,022 --> 00:17:07,023
THERE'S A COUPLE OF FRIDGES

564
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:10,494
DOWN THERE I THINK.

565
00:17:10,494 --> 00:17:11,228
OH ALL RIGHT,

566
00:17:11,228 --> 00:17:12,329
WELL I'M GOING TO HELP HIM OUT.

567
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:13,196
I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS

568
00:17:13,196 --> 00:17:14,231
IS NOT VERY SCIENTIFIC THIS ONE,

569
00:17:14,231 --> 00:17:15,265
I THINK THE WATER'S COOLER

570
00:17:15,265 --> 00:17:16,199
THAN THE AIR AND IT'S GOING

571
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,400
TO KEEP THE POP COLD,

572
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,301
SO I TELL BILL TO HOLD ONTO

573
00:17:18,301 --> 00:17:20,303
THE ROPE, I SHOULD OF TOLD HIM,

574
00:17:20,303 --> 00:17:21,104
MY FAULT, I SHOULD OF TOLD

575
00:17:21,104 --> 00:17:21,905
HIM TO HOLD ONTO THE END

576
00:17:21,905 --> 00:17:22,739
OF THE ROPE.

577
00:17:22,739 --> 00:17:25,342
>>BILL: WHOA!

578
00:17:25,342 --> 00:17:25,976
>>RED: HE'S SCIENTIFIC,

579
00:17:25,976 --> 00:17:28,612
HE'S NOT SMART.

580
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:29,813
NOW WE'LL GO BACK AND WE'LL

581
00:17:29,813 --> 00:17:32,082
WAIT FOR THE POP TO COOL,

582
00:17:32,082 --> 00:17:34,251
AND WE WAIT THERE 5, 6,

583
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:36,620
IT WAS PROBABLY AROUND 7 SECONDS

584
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,721
I GUESS AND THEN WE DECIDED

585
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:38,588
WE YOU KNOW, WE WORKED UP

586
00:17:38,588 --> 00:17:39,556
A PRETTY POWERFUL THIRST,

587
00:17:39,556 --> 00:17:40,557
SO BILL HAULS IT IN AND

588
00:17:40,557 --> 00:17:43,560
HAUL IT IN THERE BILL,

589
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,998
HO! HO! HEAVE-HO! HO-HEAVE!

590
00:17:47,998 --> 00:17:50,634

591
00:17:50,634 --> 00:17:53,069
ANYWAY UP SHE COMES AND WE

00:17:53,069 --> 00:17:54,671
EACH GET OUT A CAN OF POP,

593
00:17:54,671 --> 00:17:55,505
OF COURSE SHE'S BEEN SHAKEN

594
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:56,439

595
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:58,108

00:18:00,443 --> 00:18:03,046
OH THAT'S FUNNY ISN'T IT BILL?

599
00:18:03,046 --> 00:18:04,748
WHAT, YOURS IS OKAY?

600
00:18:04,748 --> 00:18:07,350

>>RED: AND NOW HERE'S

602
00:18:09,586 --> 00:18:11,187
SOMETHING FOR YOUNG MINDS FROM

603
00:18:11,187 --> 00:18:13,390
SOMETHING WITH A SMALL MIND.

604
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,324
>>HAROLD: YO! WELCOME TO

605
00:18:15,492 --> 00:18:16,593
A BRAND NEW FEATURE ON

606
00:18:16,593 --> 00:18:17,927
THE RED GREEN SHOW WHICH

607
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:19,329
I'M SURE IS GOING TO BE

608
00:18:19,329 --> 00:18:20,397
INTEREST TO ANYONE UNDER

609
00:18:20,397 --> 00:18:22,732
THE AGE OF 80.

610
00:18:22,732 --> 00:18:24,100
OKAY NOBODY TELLS YOU

611
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,101
HOW TO BE A TEENAGER BUT

612
00:18:25,101 --> 00:18:25,902
EVERYBODY TELLS YOU HOW

613
00:18:25,902 --> 00:18:27,303
NOT TO BE ONE RIGHT?

614
00:18:27,303 --> 00:18:28,471
LIKE DON'T LEAVE

00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:29,639
YOUR ROOM A MESS,

616
00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:30,540

DOOR OPEN ALL NIGHT,

618
00:18:31,908 --> 00:18:32,676
DON'T GO STEALING A CAR

00:18:32,676 --> 00:18:35,378
AND GO JOYRIDING.

620
00:18:35,378 --> 00:18:36,546
THAT'S WHY KIDS JOIN GANGS,

621
00:18:36,546 --> 00:18:37,881
SO THEY KNOW HOW TO BEHAVE

622
00:18:37,881 --> 00:18:39,682
THAT AND YOU KNOW TO PROTECT

623

THEM FROM OTHER GANGS

624
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:42,352
OF COURSE, WELL, OKAY,

YOUR SWITCHBLADE?

630
00:18:47,757 --> 00:18:48,658

WE'D HAVE LIKE DRIVE-BY

634
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,399
SCIENCE CLASSES,

170 MILES PER HOUR?

638
00:19:01,504 --> 00:19:02,806
IMAGINE THE UNITED WAY GANG

639
00:19:02,806 --> 00:19:04,274
VERSUS THE UNICEF WAY GANG

640

IN LIKE A FUNDRAISER HUH?

641
00:19:06,876 --> 00:19:07,777
THAT'D BE PRETTY NEAT,

642
00:19:07,777 --> 00:19:08,912

THEY ALL SANG AND DANCED

648
00:19:14,918 --> 00:19:15,985
DIDN'T THEY?

649
00:19:15,985 --> 00:19:17,520
♪ WHEN YOU'RE HOT YOU'RE HOT ♪

650
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,222
REMEMBER?

651
00:19:19,222 --> 00:19:19,889

00:19:25,695 --> 00:19:26,763
YOU SEE WHAT THEY DID

658
00:19:26,763 --> 00:19:29,265
TO YOUR BIKE.

659
00:19:29,265 --> 00:19:33,536
>>HAROLD: EXCELLENT.

660
00:19:33,536 --> 00:19:34,304
>>RED: SORRY HAROLD,

00:19:35,004 --> 00:19:36,973
THEY WERE BIG GIRLS.

663
00:19:41,344 --> 00:19:43,112
>>RED: YOU KNOW THEY SAY

664
00:19:43,112 --> 00:19:43,880
THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE

MURRAY'S STORE AND FROM WHAT

670
00:19:48,384 --> 00:19:49,385
I CAN TELL THE FUTURE IS GOING

671
00:19:49,385 --> 00:19:50,653
TO BE BALD ON THE SIDES

672
00:19:50,653 --> 00:19:51,921
WITH A LONG PIECE OF HAIR ON

673
00:19:51,921 --> 00:19:53,523
THE TOP, SPIT, SWEAR, SMOKE

674
00:19:53,523 --> 00:19:54,457

SIDE OF THE LODGE

729
00:21:33,256 --> 00:21:35,258

>>BOB: OH YEAH, YEAH,

731
00:21:36,092 --> 00:21:36,893
THEY CLOSED THAT MINE

732
00:21:36,893 --> 00:21:38,761
ABOUT 50 YEARS AGO,

733
00:21:38,761 --> 00:21:39,829
IT WAS AN OLD COAL MINE.

734
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:40,830

ENOUGH COAL TO PAY FOR ITSELF,

737
00:21:42,632 --> 00:21:43,666
SO OF COURSE THEY SOLD IT

738
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:47,670
