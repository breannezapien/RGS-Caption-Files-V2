1
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:05,105
ONE OF THE MOST MADDENING THINGS
IN THE WORLD IS TO DISCOVER

2
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:07,273
THAT SOME BRAIN-DEAD MORON
HAS TAKEN HIS KEY

3
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:09,542
AND COME DOWN THE SIDE
OF YOUR VEHICLE,

4
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:10,977
SCRATCHING THE PAINT JOB.

5
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:13,446
BUT, HERE'S A CHEAP, EASY WAY
TO TURN BAD NEWS INTO GOOD NEWS.

6
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:18,084
TAKE A ROLL OF DUCT TAPE
AND ADD SOME PIZZAZZ
TO YOUR VEHICLE,

7
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:20,487
WHILE COVERING UP
THE UGLY SCRATCHES.

8
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:23,723
THIS SCRATCH IS GOING TO
MAKE A DANDY RACING STRIPE,

9
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:27,460
BUT WHATEVER SHAPE
THE SCRATCH IS...

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,866
COVER IT WITH DUCT TAPE AND
IT'LL BE YOUR LITTLE SECRET.

11
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:36,703
THE SECRET THAT EVERY
HANDYMAN KNOWS, WHICH IS:

12
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,139
"THINGS AREN'T ALWAYS
WHAT THEY SEEM."

13
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,741
[laughter]

14
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:46,613
IT'S THE RED GREEN SHOW!!!

15
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:50,450
HERE'S THE MAN WHO ONCE SAID:

16
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,419
"I BEG YOUR PARDON,
I NEVER PROMISED YOU A BUICK."

17
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:53,686
YOUR HOST AND HERO, MY UNCLE:

18
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:55,789
RED GREEEEEEN!!!

19
00:00:55,789 --> 00:01:03,863
[applause]

20
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:05,765
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
APPRECIATE IT.

21
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,200
GOT A LITTLE ADVICE FOR YA:

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,335
IF YOU'RE IN THE MARKET
FOR A CHAINSAW,

23
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:13,406
I WOULD SUGGEST YOU STAY AWAY
FROM THE SWANSON PRUNE PAL.

24
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,743
I BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE
AND IT'S TOTALLY USELESS.

25
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:20,880
HE USED HIS PRUNE PAL
TO SAW OFF THE ROOF OF A CAR.

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,284
OF COURSE, THEN THEY TRIED
TO STIFF ME ON THE WARRANTY.

27
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,386
BUT, WE GOT OVER THAT HURDLE.

28
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:27,921
OH YEAH, YEAH,
YOU SURE DID.

29
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,823
YOU SHOWED THEM.
HA! HA! HA!

30
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:32,325
YEAH, HE LIED!

31
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:33,993
YEAH, HE SAID
IT WOULDN'T CUT.

32
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:36,830
HE DIDN'T MENTION
THAT IT WOULDN'T CUT
THROUGH SHEET METAL.

33
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,967
ANYWAY, THE COMPANY SENT
ME A REFUND CHEQUE,
A MONTH AGO.

34
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:42,969
AND WHERE IS IT?

35
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:46,873
WELL, IT'S TRAPPED INSIDE
OUR USELESS POSTAL SYSTEM,
THAT'S WHERE IT IS.

36
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,942
DID YOU EVEN BOTHER
TO CHECK THE MAIL?

37
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:53,213
HAROLD, I CHECK
THE MAIL EVERY DAY.

38
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,882
I LOOK AT IT ALL, HAROLD.

39
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:58,785
I GUESS THESE JUST
SLIPPED THROUGH
THE CRACKS?

40
00:01:58,785 --> 00:01:59,886
LOOK AT THIS...

41
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:01,654
WE GOTTA VISA BILL.

42
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:04,958
ELECTRIC BILL...

43
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,626
GAS BILL...

44
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,027
TAX DEPARTMENT...

45
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,896
SHERIFF'S OFFICE...

46
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,598
ED MCMAHON...

47
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,533
ED MCMAHON...

48
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,835
ED MCMAHON.

49
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:17,770
HAROLD, THE LETTER'S NOT THERE.

50
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,807
THE POSTAL SYSTEM IN THIS
COUNTRY IS AN EMBARRASSMENT.

51
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,942
HERE IT IS!
WHAT?

52
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:25,512
OH, FOR GOSH SAKE.

53
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:28,648
BUT, I STILL SAY
THE SYSTEM STINKS.

54
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:32,152
I'VE GOT A GOOD MIND
TO START MY OWN
POSTAL SYSTEM.

55
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:37,557
[laughing]

56
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,826
[sarcastically]
YOU GOT A GOOD MIND.

57
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,594
[laughter]

58
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:49,269
IT'S TIME FOR
"THE POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME."

59
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,838
AND TODAY'S CONTESTANT
WILL BE PLAYING FOR
A FREE COUPON

60
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,740
FOR ONE OF THESE
DIRT SUCKER VACUUMS.

61
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,508
OH! OH! OH!

62
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,943
WHOA!!!

63
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:02,715
[laughter]

64
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:05,818
PRIZES ARE INSIDE.

65
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:08,421
[laughter]

66
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:11,357
TODAY'S CONTESTANT
IS MR. MIKE HAMAR.

67
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:16,629
[applause]

68
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:22,368
UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO GET MR. MIKE HAMAR
TO SAY THIS WORD:

69
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,875
ALL RIGHT, HAROLD.

70
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,077
GO!!!

71
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:33,046
MIKE, THE THING
AROUND A HOUSE?

72
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,281
AN ALARM SYSTEM?

73
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:38,318
NO, THIS IS FLAT,
ON THE GROUND,
SPREAD OUT.

74
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,420
ME, GETTING ARRESTED?

75
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,022
YOU KNOW THAT PLACE
YOU'RE IN NOW...

76
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,591
WHAT HAVE YOU
GOT OUT FRONT?

77
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,626
AH, TIRES...

78
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,194
A RUSTY BIKE?

79
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,896
SHOPPING CARTS?
NO.

80
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,332
A CAMARO ON
CEMENT BLOCKS.

81
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,801
A TRANS AM ON WOODEN BLOCKS?

82
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,536
A FORD PICKUP ON FIRE?

83
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:59,839
UNDER THE VEHICLES,
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

84
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,507
DOGS.

85
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:04,811
NO, THIS IS KIND OF
A FUZZY GREEN THING.

86
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,480
OH, THAT OLD SICK CAT?

87
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,183
I THINK HE'S
GOT A DISEASE

88
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:14,587
'CAUSE THE DOGS WON'T
BITE 'EM NO MORE.

89
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,991
NO, I'M SAYIN' UNDER THE DOGS
AND THE SICK CAT,

90
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,059
YOU'VE GOT WHAT?

91
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,995
UH, UH... OH!

92
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,630
ASTROTURF?
YOU'RE SO CLOSE.

93
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,131
SOD?

94
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:26,432
A BUNCH OF GRASS?

95
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,501
YOU'RE ALMOST OUT
OF TIME, UNCLE RED.

96
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,103
OKAY, YOU SAID,
"A BUNCH OF GRASS".

97
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,704
IF YOU HAVE A BUNCH
OF GRASS YOU GET...?

98
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,373
TWO YEARS LESS A DAY?

99
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,907
[laughter]

100
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:42,448
WELL, WE GOT OUR POSSUM LODGE
POSTAL SERVICE UP AND RUNNING.

101
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:46,352
BUSTER HADFIELD WAS
THE FIRST TO SIGN UP.

102
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,355
WELL, THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE
THE REAL POSTAL SERVICE WON'T
DELIVER TO HIS HOUSE.

103
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,357
RIGHT, THE MAILMAN SAID
HE WON'T GO BACK THERE

104
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:54,027
UNTIL BUSTER GETS
HIS DOG NEUTERED.

105
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,897
I'LL TELL YA, NOTHING
THAT COMES IN THE MAIL
IS WORTH THAT.

106
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,201
DUSTY FARNSWORTH
WAS A WIRY CODGER 

107
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,570
BLIND IN ONE EYE
AND HALF LAME 

108
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,806
PEOPLE SAY HE WAS
BORN IN A BARN 

109
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,309
AND RAISED IN
A POKER GAME 

110
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,011
ONE DAY, HE TRIED TO DRINK
ALL THE BEER IN THE LODGE 

111
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,681
WE THOUGHT HE WAS
ONLY BLUFFIN' 

112
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,149
BUT, WHEN HE WAS DONE 

113
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,583
WE SAID, YOU
MUST'VE BEEN DRY 

114
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,619
HE SAID, THEY DON'T CALL ME
DUSTY FOR NOTHIN 

115
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:25,525
YOU KNOW, AFTER 50 YEARS OF
OVEREATING AND UNDERACHIEVING,

116
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,994
YOU START WORRYING THAT SOMEDAY
YOUR HEART'S GONNA GO OFF

117
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,730
LIKE A WARM CAN OF POP
IN AN EARTHQUAKE.

118
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,365
THERE IS A WAY TO
AVOID THIS SCENARIO.

119
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:33,933
YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR DIET.

120
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,002
OR MAYBE, GET INVOLVED IN
A PHYSICAL FITNESS PROGRAM,

121
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,571
BUT HEY, WHO ARE WE KIDDIN'.

122
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,773
SO, THIS WEEK ON
"HANDYMAN CORNER,"

123
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,776
I THOUGHT I'D SHOW YOU HOW TO
MAKE YOUR VERY OWN PACEMAKER.

124
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,279
THE FIRST THING YOU NEED IS
ONE OF THESE HERE BALLOONS.

125
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,515
THE LONG, WIENER-SHAPED KIND,
NOT THE ROUND KIND.

126
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,760
OKAY, THAT'S GOT 'ER.

127
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,795
I HOPE THAT WAS THE BALLOON.

128
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,997
NOW, WE'RE GONNA USE THIS
TO CHECK OUR PULSE.

129
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:07,133
I KNOW, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO USE YOUR WRIST,

130
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,669
BUT AFTER DECADES OF
LIFTING CHEESEBURGERS
AND LARGE DRAFTS,

131
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:13,773
YOUR WRIST GETS PRETTY THICK
AND THE PULSE GETS BURIED
WAY DOWN THERE.

132
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,843
SO, WE'RE GONNA CHECK
OUR PULSE IN OUR NECK.

133
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:20,046
SEE, AS YOU GET OLDER,
YOUR BLOOD STARTS TO PICK
WHERE IT WANTS TO GO,

134
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,048
BUT IT WILL ALWAYS
GO TO YOUR BRAIN.

135
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,451
IF YOURS DOESN'T,
YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT
WATCHING THIS ANYWAY.

136
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:28,955
YOU KNOW THE FUNNY SOUND
A BALLOON MAKES WHEN YOU
LET THE AIR OUT SLOWLY?

137
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:32,225
[squeak, squeak]

138
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:36,429
WE'RE GONNA USE THAT SOUND
TO COUNT OUR HEARTBEATS.

139
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:40,700
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS
PUT THE BALLOON IN YOUR COLLAR.

140
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,436
IF IT'S TOO LOOSE,
JUST BLOW 'ER UP A BIT.

141
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,738
OR, IF YOU'RE SHORT ON CASH,
JUST LEAVE THE BALLOON THERE

142
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,273
AND SUE SOMEONE FOR WHIPLASH.

143
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,508
HA, HA, HA.

144
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,444
[balloon pops]
OWWW!!!

145
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,479
OR, SUE THE BALLOON MAKER.

146
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,047
BOY, THE HEART'S RACING NOW.

147
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:02,155
NOW, IN A SECOND, THIS BALLOON
IS GONNA START PULSING ALONG
WITH MY HEART, ALL RIGHT?

148
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:05,825
AND, YOU'LL WANT TO RECORD
THAT SOUND FOR YOUR PULSE.

149
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,327
GET YOURSELF ONE OF THESE
LITTLE CASSETTE RECORDER DEALS

150
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,163
OFF A TEENAGER WHILE
THEY'RE ASLEEP,

151
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,331
SAY, DURING CLASS.

152
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:15,134
OKAY, SET THAT ON RECORD.

153
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,502
AND START 'ER PULSING.

154
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,271
[squeak, squeak]

155
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,940
[squeak, squeak, squeak]

156
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,675
SOUNDS LIKE HAROLD
WHEN HE WAS A KID.

157
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,943
[squeak, squeak]

158
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:26,646
NOW, YOU DON'T NEED
A LOT OF THAT.

159
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,614
A HALF-HOUR IS PLENTY.

160
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:32,452
WHAT YOU NEED NOW IS TO GET
YOURSELF A DIGITAL CLOCK
THAT DISPLAYS SECONDS.

161
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,654
NOW, YOU PLAY BACK THE TAPE,

162
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:37,290
AND THEN, YOU ADJUST THE CLOCK,

163
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,960
SO THAT, YOU'RE GETTING
A PULSE EVERY SECOND.

164
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,731
I'VE GOT THE DIGITAL CLOCK
SET TO MY OWN HEARTBEAT.

165
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,733
THAT BRINGS ME TO
THE FINAL STEP:

166
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:51,471
WIRING THE DIGITAL CLOCK
UP TO MY HEART.

167
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,208
I'VE GOT A WIRE RUNNIN' OFF
THE BACK OF THE DIGITAL READOUT.

168
00:07:55,208 --> 00:08:00,480
I'LL JUST TAKE THE OTHER END
AND HOOK IT UP TO THE HEART AREA

169
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,949
BY SOLDERING IT TO A COUPLE
OF ADJACENT CHEST HAIRS.

170
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,450
[sizzle]

171
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,052
OW... OW...

172
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,590
YOU MIGHT WANNA HAVE
A COUPLE OF ASPIRINS
BEFORE YOU TRY THAT.

173
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,425
BUT, SHE'S DONE,

174
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,660
[clock beeping]
AND NOW, TINY ELECTRICAL JOLTS
FROM THIS DIGITAL UNIT

175
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,763
[clock beeping]
ARE GOING TO KEEP MY HEART
RUNNING LIKE CLOCKWORK.

176
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:19,532
[clock beeping]
NOW, WHEN PEOPLE SAY:
"HOW'S THE OLD TICKER?"

177
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,801
[clock beeping]
I DON'T HAVE TO DO
A BAD, DIRTY JOKE, ANYMORE.

178
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,402
[clock beeping]
SO, REMEMBER:

179
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:24,971
[clock beeping]
" IF WOMEN DON'T
FIND YOU HANDSOME,

180
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,939
[clock beeping]
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY."

181
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:30,243
[continuous tone]
OH MAN, AM I DEAD?

182
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,211
[continuous tone]
OH NO, JUST ON SNOOZE.

183
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:39,552
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU OLDER GUYS
WHO'VE REACHED THAT AGE

184
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:42,822
WHERE YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW ANYTHING WORKS, ANYMORE.

185
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:46,692
LIKE, UH, SAY YOU WANT
TO PHONE A FRIEND.

186
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:51,931
USED TO BE, IF HE WASN'T HOME,
HE JUST WOULDN'T ANSWER.

187
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,734
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

188
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,702
YOU GET THE VOICE MAIL.

189
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,438
IT TELLS YA TO PRESS
THE POUND SIGN.

190
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:03,409
SO, YOU SAY TO YOURSELF:
" WHAT'S THE POUND SIGN?"

191
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:05,912
LB.

192
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:09,615
[laughter]

193
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,150
YOU LOOK AT YOUR PHONE,

194
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,419
I HAVEN'T GOT ANY LB HERE.

195
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:20,893
I GOT MEM, DEL, SHIFT, SAVE,
HOLD, MUTE, BUT NO LB.

196
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,496
AND NOW, YOU FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT.

197
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:26,599
BUT IT'S NOT YOU, IT'S THEM!

198
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,134
YOU KNOW,  THEM.

199
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:31,337
THE PEOPLE WHO CHANGE THINGS
JUST TO BUG YA.

200
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,905
REMEMBER THE OLD DAYS...

201
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,874
YOU HAD A RECORD PLAYER AND
ALL YOU HAD TO FIGURE OUT

202
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:38,010
WAS WHETHER TO PUT IT ON
33 AND A 1/3 OR 45 RPM?

203
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,179
AND THE SIZE OF THE RECORD
WAS A BIG HINT.

204
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:45,051
[laughter and applause]

205
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,953
AND NOW, THEY GOT
GRAPHIC EQUALIZERS

206
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,922
AND DOLBY 5.1, AND SO ON.

207
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:53,826
HEY, IF YOUR EARS CAN'T TELL
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
A.M. AND F.M.,

208
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:56,662
WHAT DO YOU NEED WITH
A DUAL MONO PREAMPLIFIER

209
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:59,865
AND ELECTROSTATIC
HYBRID SPEAKERS

210
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:03,302
AND NON-METALLIC
CARBON-FIBRE INTERCONNECTS?

211
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:11,477
[loud applause]

212
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,446
YOU GOTTA FEEL
BETTER ABOUT THIS...

213
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,648
YOU'RE NOT A COMPLETE MORON
LIVING IN THE STONE AGES.

214
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,416
I'LL TELL YA SOMETHING,

215
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,119
ALL THAT OLD TECHNOLOGY
IS GONNA COME RIGHT BACK.

216
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:23,089
YOU KNOW, THEY WENT TO
THE DIGITAL WATCHES,
BIG, BIG DEAL.

217
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,291
NOW, THEY'RE BACK TO
THE SWEEPING THING AGAIN.

218
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,226
I BET, IN SIX MONTHS,
THEY'LL COME OUT AND SAY

219
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:31,497
THAT BETA IS WAY BETTER
THAN VHS AND SWITCH BACK.

220
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:35,768
AND, I'LL BE RIDING
THE CREST OF THAT WAVE,
LEMME TELL YA!!!

221
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,737
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YA.

222
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:40,106
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

223
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:55,087
I'M TELLIN' YA,
THIS HOMEMADE MAIL SYSTEM
IS WORKING OUT GREAT.

224
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:56,822
YOU GOTTA HELP ME
WITH THIS, HAROLD.

225
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,191
WELL, YOU KNOW, I'D LIKE TO,

226
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:02,128
BUT I JUST HAVE THIS THING
ABOUT BEING LAUGHED AT.

227
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,096
[laughter]

228
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,865
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BE LAUGHED AT.

229
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,067
DO YOU THINK I'M
BEING LAUGHED AT?

230
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,036
YES.

231
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,438
OH, C'MON HAROLD,
LOOK AT ALL THESE LETTERS.

232
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:15,241
I'M TELLIN YA,
THIS IDEA IS WORKING.

233
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:18,644
YOU GOT FIFTY CENTS
FOR EACH ONE OF
THESE LETTERS?

234
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:22,682
NO, THIS IS MY FREE
INTRODUCTORY OFFER,

235
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,252
BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT
THE DEMAND IS THERE.

236
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,254
NOW, COME ON HAROLD,
HELP ME DELIVER THESE.

237
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:31,691
I CAN'T, I'VE GOT AN ESSAY DUE
ON THE IMPORTANCE OF CULTURE
IN MODERN SOCIETY,

238
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,093
AND THERE'S A TWO-HOUR
XENA THE WARRIOR PRINCESS.

239
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,529
TWO HOURS!
OH, COME ON, HAROLD.

240
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,097
YOU NOW, HAROLD...

241
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,565
WITH THE TWO OF US
WORKING TOGETHER,

242
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:40,900
WE'LL GET THIS DONE
IN NO TIME AT ALL.

243
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,468
YOU KNOW, HOW YOU
ALWAYS SAY TO ME:

244
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,736
"UNCLE RED,
I'D REALLY LIKE TO DO
SOMETHING TOGETHER."

245
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,004
YOU ALWAYS SAY THAT.

246
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,439
HUH?
YEAH, I GUESS I DO.

247
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,007
OKAY, OKAY?
OKAY.

248
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,309
YOU'LL HELP ME?
YEAH, OKAY.

249
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:51,777
THAT ONE'S YOURS.

250
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,616
ALL RIGHT, MEN,
THIS IS NEW MEMBER NIGHT

251
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:02,822
AND RANGER GORD HAS A GUY
HE WANTS TO PROPOSE
AS A NEW MEMBER.

252
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,490
SCARY.

253
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,893
[laughter]

254
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,762
THANK YOU, RED.

255
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,731
THANK YOU,
MEN OF POSSUM LODGE.

256
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:16,001
IT'S NOT OFTEN I COME TO YOU
LOOKING FOR A SPECIAL FAVOUR
OR CONSIDERATION.

257
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:21,974
WELL, MAYBE THAT ONE TIME WHEN
I WAS ON FIRE FROM LIGHTNING.

258
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:25,544
AND THAT TIME WHEN THAT
HAND PUPPET GOT STUCK.

259
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,581
[laughter]

260
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:32,518
ANYWAY, TONIGHT,
I'M HERE TO ASK YOU
TO OPEN YOUR LODGE...

261
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:37,890
NO, TO OPEN YOUR HEARTS
TO BERTRAM J. MERDON.

262
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,492
BERT AND I HAVE
BECOME QUITE CLOSE

263
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:42,394
SINCE HIS MOM KICKED
HIM OUT OF THE HOUSE
LAST YEAR.

264
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,296
WE ACTUALLY HAVE GONE
HIKING EVERY WEEKEND.

265
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,766
AND LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING HERE,

266
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:52,505
BERT HAS A FIRST AND LAST NAME
FOR EVERY SHRUB BETWEEN HERE
AND PORT ASBESTOS.

267
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,374
THINK ABOUT THAT.

268
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,143
THAT'S DEDICATION!

269
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,078
WHAT DO YOU SAY,
CAN HE JOIN?

270
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,118
GUYS...?

271
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,187
UH, GORD, IF BERT
JOINS THE LODGE,

272
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,688
WOULD HE BE
TAKING YOU OUT
HIKING ALL THE TIME

273
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,223
AND AWAY FROM
THE LODGE?

274
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,324
ABSOLUTELY.

275
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:13,526
ALL THOSE
IN FAVOUR?

276
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,995
[in unison]:
AYE!!!

277
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,533
[this sequence is
narrated by Red]

278
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,601
BILL HAD ASKED ME TO MEET
HIM OUT BEHIND THE LODGE

279
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,904
FOR A LITTLE TARGET PRACTICE.

280
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:28,574
DID YOU BRING THE GUN?

281
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:32,478
THAT'S A FISHING ROD.

282
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,947
OH BOY! OH NO!

283
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,682
KIDS, DON'T DO THIS AT HOME.

284
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:40,219
OH BOY! OOH!!!

285
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,521
I'VE NEVER SEEN A MAN
OF HIS CALIBRE BEFORE.

286
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,323
OH, YOU'VE GOT A POP CAN.

287
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,691
WHERE ARE GONNA PUT IT?

288
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:46,992
THERE'S A BUNCH OF JUNK THERE.

289
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,494
ON WHAT... ON WHAT?

290
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,796
THERE YOU GO, WE GOT A STUMP,
...A STUMP, YEAH, YEAH.

291
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,932
GIVE ME THE POP CAN,
GIVE ME THE POP CAN.

292
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,134
LET'S GET GOING.

293
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,336
YOU'RE GONNA EMPTY THAT?

294
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,538
YOU'RE GONNA DRINK
THE WHOLE POP CAN?

295
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:02,074
JUST POUR IT ON THE GROUND.

296
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,109
BILL, THAT'S GONNA HURT.

297
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,845
THAT'S GOTTA SMART.

298
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,379
JUST POUR IT OUT.

299
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,181
BILL, BILL, GOSH!

300
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,716
OH, BILL!

301
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:16,555
OH, MAN!

302
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:22,161
SEE NOW, IF I DID THAT,
I'D HAVE INCREDIBLE HEARTBURN,

303
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,129
BUT HE SEEMS ALRIGHT.

304
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:29,435
[a huge burp erupts from Bill]

305
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:32,137
I GUESS HE'S FINE.

306
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:36,075
ALL RIGHT, SO...
I PUT THE CAN UP THERE.

307
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,576
GIMME THE GUN.

308
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:46,952
HERE WE GO, HERE WE GO!

309
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:48,220
[bang!]

310
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,055
THERE WE GO!!!

311
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,390
NOT BAD, EH?

312
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,759
FIRST SHOT.

313
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:02,001
[a huge burp erupts from Bill]

314
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,803
HEY, IF YOU'RE SICK,
GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

315
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:07,873
ALL RIGHT, I'LL PUT THE CAN
BACK UP THERE.

316
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:09,308
OKAY, BILL, AWAY YOU GO.

317
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,444
[bang!]

318
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,246
TAKE ANOTHER SHOT.

319
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,381
[bang!]

320
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:19,018
FIRE A FEW OFF.

321
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:24,657
THAT'S NOT WORKING FOR YOU,
YOU NEED AN UZI.

322
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:29,528
WHAT'S HE UP TO?

323
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:33,465
OH, LITTLE STONES AND
PIECES OF GRAVEL.

324
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:36,035
[bang! Bang! Bang!]

325
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,837
HOLY MACKEREL!
HE'S PEPPERIN' 'ER.

326
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:44,009
YOU MUST'VE GOT IT.
YOU MUST'VE GOT IT.

327
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,644
THE POP CAN'S STILL THERE.

328
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,413
HOLY SMOKE!

329
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,515
LOOK WHAT YOU DID TO THE LOG!!!

330
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:52,251
WOW, LOOK AT THAT!

331
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,652
YEAH, BUT, BILL...

332
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,154
YOU STILL DIDN'T
GET THE POP CAN.

333
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,957
WHAT? WHAT?

334
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,625
[burp!!!]

335
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,531
[dogs barking]

336
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,167
[dogs barking]
HAROLD, GET YOUR
CAN IN HERE.

337
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:17,876
[dogs barking]

338
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:23,615
YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT STRESS
IN THE WORKPLACE?

339
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,552
WE'VE GOT A SERIOUS FLAW
IN OUR PLAN, UNCLE RED.

340
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,354
I'LL TELL YOU
THE PROBLEM.

341
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,689
I'M NOT THINKING
BIG ENOUGH.

342
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:33,892
NO, THE PROBLEM IS
YOU'RE NOT THINKING
OFTEN ENOUGH.

343
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:36,095
NO... NO, NO.

344
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,698
WE GOT PEOPLE PAYING
50 CENTS APIECE TO
DELIVER A LETTER.

345
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:44,203
WHAT IF WE CHARGE THEM
A DOLLAR NOT TO DELIVER
A BILL TO THEM, HUH?

346
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,940
AND THEN, MAYBE FIVE BUCKS,
NOT TO GET ANY JUNK MAIL
FOR THE WHOLE YEAR.

347
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,274
YEAH!!!

348
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:52,644
AND THEN, WE'LL PAY
$10,000 TO POST BAIL.

349
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,947
IT'S A FEDERAL OFFENSE
TO WITHHOLD MAIL,
UNCLE RED.

350
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,548
I'M NOT WITHHOLDING MAIL.

351
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,250
I'M DISTILLING IT.

352
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,085
[laughter]

353
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,454
WHAT IF A GUY PAYS
50 CENTS TO DELIVER
A BILL, RIGHT?

354
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:04,923
AND THE OTHER GUY
PAYS A DOLLAR NOT
TO RECEIVE THAT BILL.

355
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,692
WHAT HAVE WE GOT?

356
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,327
WE GOT A BIDDING
WAR, HAROLD.

357
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,329
I'M TELLIN' YA, MAN.

358
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,697
WE'RE GONNA BE
ROLLIN' IN IT.

359
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,865
OH YEAH, YEAH.

360
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,466
I JUST WISH
IT WAS MONEY.

361
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,502
[laughter]

362
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,506
WELCOME TO THE "EXPERTS"
PORTION OF THE SHOW.

363
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:24,576
WHERE WE EXAMINE THOSE
THREE LITTLE WORDS THAT
MEN FIND SO HARD TO SAY:

364
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:27,012
[studio audience]:
I DON'T KNOW!!!

365
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,081
HA, HA!
WAY TO GO!

366
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,716
JOINING MY UNCLE RED
ON THIS PART OF THE SHOW

367
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,317
IS HIS BEST FRIEND
IN THE WHOLE WIDE ROOM:

368
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:33,619
MR. MIKE HAMAR.

369
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:39,958
[applause]

370
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,628
MIKE'S UP HERE TRYING
TO LIVE DOWN HIS
CRIMINAL PAST,

371
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:45,898
BUT EVERYBODY JUST
KEEPS BRINGING IT UP.

372
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,399
SORRY.

373
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,102
[laughter]

374
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,171
WE HAVE A LETTER FROM
A VIEWER IN OREGON WHO WRITES:

375
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,506
"DEAR EXPERTS..."

376
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:58,210
"I JUST RECEIVED AN INVITATION
TO GO BACK TO MY HOMETOWN
FOR A HIGH SCHOOL REUNION."

377
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,946
"IF I DON'T GO,
PEOPLE WILL ASSUME
MY LIFE IS A MESS,"

378
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:02,781
"I'M FAT AND UGLY,
I'M A FAILURE,"

379
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,149
"AND I'M ASHAMED
OF MY LIFE."

380
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:06,952
"WHEREAS, IF I DO GO,
PEOPLE WILL KNOW FOR SURE."

381
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:09,354
[laughter]

382
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,190
"WHAT CAN I DO?"

383
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,625
YOU GO TO THE REUNION,
BUT YOU ARRIVE LATE

384
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,261
AND YOU SEND YOUR WIFE
INTO THE REUNION HALL.

385
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,796
WHAT IF YOU'RE NOT MARRIED?

386
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,798
THEN, YOU SEND IN
ONE OF YOUR KIDS.

387
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:24,036
[laughter]

388
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,004
SO, THEY GO
INTO THE HALL

389
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:29,341
AND THEY GO
TO THE TABLE WITH
ALL THE NAMETAGS ON IT

390
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:32,211
AND THEY SCAN
THE NAMETAGS
LEFT LYING THERE.

391
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,679
AND THEN,
THEY COME OUT
TO THE CAR

392
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,747
AND THEY TELL YA
WHO DIDN'T SHOW.

393
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,349
AND THEN, YOU
QUICKLY DECIDE

394
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,952
WHO IS THE PERSON
YOU HATED THE MOST

395
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,687
AND THEN, YOU
GO IN THERE,

396
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,122
YOU PICK UP
THEIR NAMETAG,

397
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,623
AND PRETEND
TO BE THEM.

398
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,225
[laughter]

399
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:50,562
THAT'S THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS
PLAN I HAVE EVER HEARD.

400
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,464
YOU KNOW, IT WOULD
PROBABLY WORK, TOO.

401
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,934
I DID THIS.

402
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,569
REMEMBER AT OUR
HIGH SCHOOL REUNION?

403
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:01,406
I PRETENDED THAT I WAS
THE CLASS PRESIDENT,

404
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,609
WALLY KIBBLER.

405
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,010
AND EVERYONE WAS GOING:

406
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,913
"BOY WALLY,
YOU'VE CHANGED."

407
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:12,251
AND I SAID THAT IT WAS
ALL THE HARD LIVIN'
AND DRINKIN'.

408
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:15,020
AND THEN, I MADE UP
A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF

409
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,955
ABOUT WHAT A
LOSER I WAS

410
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,958
AND HOW I ENDED UP
IN JAIL FOR A SERIES
OF PETTY CRIMES.

411
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,994
AND SO ON.

412
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,530
REAL PITIFUL, EH?

413
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,232
AND THEN, I SAID,
DID YOU HEAR ABOUT
MIKE HAMAR?

414
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:33,038
HE MARRIED A SUPERMODEL AND
NOW HE'S THE HEAD OF CHRYSLER.

415
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:36,875
I ALWAYS KNEW
THAT GUY WOULD GO FAR.

416
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,678
YOU KNOW, MIKE,
IT DIDN'T WORK
ALL THAT WELL.

417
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,413
EVERYBODY KNEW
IT WAS YOU

418
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,282
'CAUSE THEY EITHER
SAT ON THE JURY

419
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:46,251
OR TESTIFIED
AT YOUR TRIALS.

420
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:51,256
IT'S ALSO UNFORTUNATE
THAT YOU CHOSE THE FELLA
WHO'S NOW THE MAYOR.

421
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:52,824
THE MAYOR?

422
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:54,593
BOY, HE'S SURE LOOKIN' ROUGH.

423
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:57,196
[laughter and applause]

424
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:03,402
[police sirens blaring]

425
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:13,178
ALL RIGHT,
I GUESS STARTIN' UP
OUR OWN POSTAL SYSTEM

426
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:16,381
IS NOT AN ENTIRELY
RISK-FREE VENTURE,

427
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,684
BUT I THINK WE
PROVED OUR POINT.

428
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,419
WHAT POINT
IS THAT?

429
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,888
WHAT POINT WOULD
THAT BE?

430
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,690
THE POINT THAT
CRIME DOESN'T PAY?

431
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,758
ONE SIZE HANDCUFF
FITS ALL?

432
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:29,695
BEING FRISKED ISN'T AS
MUCH FUN AS IT LOOKS?

433
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,196
WHAT POINT IS THAT?

434
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,831
WE GOT CHARGED
WITH A FEDERAL
MISDEMEANOR

435
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:34,433
AND FINED $500.

436
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,635
AND NOW, I HAVE
A CRIMINAL RECORD.

437
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:39,004
THAT'LL MAKE YOU MORE
POPULAR AT SCHOOL.

438
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,573
OH, AS IF!!!

439
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,842
OH, ALL RIGHT, HAROLD,
WHAT DO YOU SAY...

440
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:46,411
I SHOULD JUST
GO ALONG TO
GET ALONG?

441
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,614
YOU CAN'T FIGHT
CITY HALL, IS THAT IT?

442
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,616
RIGHT, YOU CAN'T!

443
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:52,017
LAWYERS CAN,
MILLIONAIRES CAN,

444
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,685
YOU CAN'T!!!

445
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:56,822
YOU FIGHT CITY HALL,
WE END UP IN CITY JAIL.

446
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,523
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

447
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,525
I'LL DO NOTHING.

448
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,561
WILL THAT MAKE YOU HAPPY?

449
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:05,530
IF I STOP TAKING PART
IN TRYING TO MAKE THIS
A BETTER WORLD TO LIVE IN?

450
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,999
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

451
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,767
THAT'S ALL I EVER
WANTED, UNCLE RED.

452

454
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,239
COME ON, THINK ABOUT IT.

455
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,475
WASN'T THAT JUST
A LITTLE BIT FUN?

456
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:20,445
YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO
RIDE AROUND IN A POLICE CAR
WITH THE SIRENS GOING,

457
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,214
YEAH.

458
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,716
JUST NOT FROM THE BACKSEAT
WITH A COAT OVER MY HEAD.

[laughter]

460

IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

461
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,124
IT LOOKS LIKE I'M NOT COMING
STRAIGHT HOME,

00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,759
AFTER THE MEETING TONIGHT.

463
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,094
I'M HOPING TO COME STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE ARRAIGNMENT.

464
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,763
AND, UH...

465
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,231
YOU BETTER PUT SOME MONEY ASIDE,

466
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,199
IN CASE THE COURT LEVIES A FINE.

467
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:44,436
UNLESS, THEY MAIL IT TO ME.

468
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:45,437
AND TO THE REST OF YA,

469
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:46,805
THANKS FOR WATCHING

470
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,440
AND ON BEHALF OF MYSELF,
AND HAROLD,

471
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,842
AND THE WHOLE GANG UP HERE
AT POSSUM LODGE,

472
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,344
"KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE."

473
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,851
ALL RISE.

474
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:08,994
[lodge members]:
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI.

475
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,829
OKAY, OUR FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT:

476
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,764
WE HAD A LITTLE MIX-UP
IN OUR MAIL SYSTEM.

477
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:15,233
APPARENTLY, A LETTER THAT
WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO
SUSIE McCLINTOCK

478
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:16,902
WENT TO SOMEBODY ELSE.

479
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:19,471
IF ANYBODY HAS THAT LETTER,
PLEASE RETURN IT TO ME
IMMEDIATELY,

480
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:23,675
AS IT CONTAINS COMMENTS
OF A HIGHLY PERSONAL NATURE.

481
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,411
