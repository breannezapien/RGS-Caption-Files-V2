1
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,039
OH, DON'T WORRY.
I'M JUST FAKING THIS.

2
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:07,941
PULLIN' THE CHUTE,
I THINK THEY CALL IT.

3
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:11,011
I JUST WANTED TO SHOW YOU
WHAT A GREAT TOOL THESE
ADJUSTABLE CANES ARE

4
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:13,880
FOR ANY OF YOU TRAVELLING
HANDYMEN OUT THERE.

5
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:16,282
FOR STARTERS, WHEN THE
ATTENDANT AT THE GATE SAYS,

6
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,752
"NOW BOARDING ALL
FIRST CLASS PASSENGERS

7
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:20,387
"AND THOSE
NEEDING ASSISTANCE,"

8
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:21,855
THAT MEANS YOU.

9
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:24,791
FIRST CLASS TREATMENT
ON A THIRD CLASS TICKET.

10
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:26,259
AND ONCE YOU GET
INSIDE THE PLANE,

11
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:28,261
THIS BABY REALLY
KICKS INTO HIGH GEAR.

12
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:30,663
USE IT TO STUFF
YOUR BAGS UNDER THE SEAT;

13
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,399
OR TURN YOUR LIGHT ON;

14
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:34,801
OR TURN THE OTHER
GUY'S LIGHT OFF;

15
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:37,270
OR FLIP HER AROUND AND BRING
THE REFRESHMENT CART A
LITTLE BIT CLOSER.

16
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:42,342
OKAY, HERE'S THE
BEST PART...

17
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,377
ONCE YOU GET YOUR
SEAT THE WAY YOU LIKE IT,

18
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:49,716
JUST ADJUT THE CANE SO IT
JAMS UP AGAINST THE NEXT
GUY'S HEADREST.

19
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:51,451
THAT WAY, WHEN HE'S
INCLINED TO RECLINE,

20
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,653
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DECLINE.

21
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:55,522
SO IF ANY OF YOU HAVE GOT ANY
AIR TRAVEL COMING UP,

22
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,324
I SUGGEST YOU TAKE
ALONG ONE OF THESE BABIES.

23
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,693
IN FACT, YOU CAN TAKE MINE.

24
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,129
APPARENTLY, I'M NOT ALLOWED TO
GO ON AIRPLANES FOR A WHILE.

25
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:15,041
[cheers and applause]

26
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:20,580
ALL RIGHT.

27
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,249
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

28
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,984
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

29
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:29,089
WELL, IT'S A BIG, BIG WEEK UP
AT THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

30
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,825
YOU KNOW PART OF HAROLD'S JOB
IS TO PUT ON THESE
SPECIAL EVENTS

31
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:34,027
TO ATTRACT TOURISTS
INTO THE AREA HERE.

32
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,862
BOY, HE'S COME UP
WITH A DANDY THIS TIME...

33
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:38,898
HE'S HIRED LOCAL DAREDEVIL,
PSYCHO ERNIE,

34
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,968
TO JUMP OVER THE LODGE
ON A MOTORCYCLE.

35
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,204
IF HE MAKES IT,
HE BREAKS A RECORD;

36
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,040
AND IF HE DOESN'T,
HE BREAKS 'SOMETHING.'

37
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,809
EITHER WAY, IT'S A
HUGE CROWD PLEASER.

38
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,544
UNCLE RED!

39
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,814
[cheers and applause]

40
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,950
PROBLEM?
WE HAVE A
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

41
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:59,152
YES! PSYCHO ERNIE
BACKED OUT.

42
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,087
I WAS JUST TALKING
TO HIM YESTERDAY.

43
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,789
HE WAS ALL
EXCITED ABOUT IT.

44
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:05,024
EVEN MORE SO WHEN HE
FOUND OUT WE'RE THE
SAME BLOOD TYPE

45
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,527
AND I'VE GOT
TWO KIDNEYS.

46
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,496
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU
TWO WERE TALKING ABOUT,

47
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,599
BUT WHEN YOU FINISHED
TALKING, HE FOUND GOD.

48
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:16,369
ALL I SAID WAS: "AFTER THE
JUMP I'LL SEE YOU ON
THE OTHER SIDE."

49
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,339
I MEANT THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE LODGE.

50
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,040
YEAH, WELL, NOW THAT
HE'S FOUND OUT ABOUT HELL,

51
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,976
HE'S VERY CONCERNED
ABOUT DYING.

52
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:25,411
WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN
REASON WITH HIM.

53
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,648
HA! YOU REASON WITH A
GUY NAMED PSYCHO.

54
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,118
WELL, HAROLD, I GUESS
WE'LL HAVE TO CANCEL.

55
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,920
NO!
NO, WE CAN'T.

56
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,289
WE'RE EXPECTING PEOPLE
FROM ALL OVER THE
TRI-COUNTY AREA.

57
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,558
AND I SOLD A LOT OF TICKETS
TO THE SENIOR COMMUNITY.

58
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,860
I'M NOT ABOUT TO TELL
THOSE DEAR, SWEET
OLD GRANDPARENTS

59
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,296
THEY'RE NOT GONNA SEE
ANY BLOOD ON SUNDAY.

60
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,101
WELL, THEN WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO FIND A REPLACEMENT.

61
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,637
BUT WHO DO WE KNOW THAT
WOULD BE STUPID ENOUGH

62
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,372
TO TRY TO JUMP
OVER THE LODGE?

63
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,943
[laughter and applause]

64
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,221
IT'S TIME FOR THE
POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

65
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:11,291
[cheers and applause]

66
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,730
TODAY'S PRIZE IS
THIS GRAB BAG

67
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,799
OF PREVIOUSLY
ENJOYED FOOTWEAR

68
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,268
GATHERED FROM THE
ROADS IN OUR AREA.

69
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,704
WHO KNOWS? THERE MIGHT
BE A MATCHING PAIR
IN HERE.

70
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,274
UH, MR. GREEN,
YOU GOT 30 SECONDS

71
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,842
TO GET WINSTON --
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

72
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,644
COVER YOUR EARS.

73
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,146
-- TO SAY THIS WORD...

74
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,083
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.

75
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,451
AND GO!

76
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,453
OKAY, WINSTON,
THIS IS AN EVENT.

77
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,889
YOU HAVE MUSIC AND
FAT PEOPLE SINGING.

78
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,725
LAST YEAR'S
CHRISTMAS PARTY?

79
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:47,727
NO, NO.
THERE'S A PHRASE...

80
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,329
PHANTOM OF THE...

81
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,930
UNDERPANTS.

82
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:59,706
OKAY, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
ITALIAN PEOPLE ENJOY.

83
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,774
SAUSAGE.

84
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,644
NO, THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT'S REALLY LOUD.

85
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,046
YOU'RE SURE IT'S
NOT SAUSAGE?

86
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,483
ALMOST OUTTA TIME,
MR. GREEN.

87
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:15,021
WHAT DOES THE NAME
PAVAROTTI MEAN TO YOU?

88
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,491
I BELIEVE IT'S A
TYPE OF CHEESE.

89
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,627
NOW, WINSTON,
YOU KNOW THIS ONE.

90
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,428
WHY ARE YOU ANSWERING
THE WRONG ANSWERS EVERY TIME?

91
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,063
ARE YOU DOING
THAT ON PURPOSE?

92
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,465
RED, IT'S JUST A GAME.

93
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,267
DON'T TURN IT INTO
A SOAP OPERA.

94
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,777
OKAY, TODAY ON
TALKING ANIMALS,

95
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,779
LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL
OFFICER ED FRID

96
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:42,982
IS GONNA TELL US A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT THE SNAPPING TURTLE.

97
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:45,051
COME ON UP
HERE, ED.

98
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,354
COME ON, NOW, ED.

99
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:49,956
I MEAN, THE TURTLE
IS JUST LYING THERE.

100
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,924
WELL, SURE, HE'S MOVING
PRETTY SLOWLY NOW,

101
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,527
BUT HE COULD STRIKE
AT ANY TIME.

102
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,596
SOUNDS LIKE AN
AUTO WORKER.

103
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,299
[laughter and applause]

104
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,902
HEY, I'M NOT
JOKING HERE, RED.

105
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,737
HE COULD SIT
THERE FOR HOURS,

106
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,205
JUST LAYING IN WAIT.

107
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,807
AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE NOT
LOOKING... AMBUSH!

108
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,410
OKAY. OKAY.
AR! AR! AR!

109
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,412
YOU KNOW, ED, THIS THING
LOOKS PRETTY HARMLESS TO ME.

110
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,780
[shushing]

111
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,315
YOU WANNA GET
HIM MAD?

112
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:16,849
HE'S GOT EARS,
YOU KNOW?

113
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,618
HE DOESN'T HAVE EARS.

114
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,687
WELL, NO,

115
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,122
BUT THEY
CAN READ LIPS.

116
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,028
WHAT DO YOU FEED A
SNAPPING TURTLE,
ANYWAY, ED?

117
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:31,531
WELL, ALMOST ANYTHING
YOU FIND IN THE WATER.

118
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:34,400
I STOCKED THIS TANK WITH
CRAYFISH, SNAILS,

119
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,069
FISH STUFF.

120
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,305
I DON'T SEE
ANYTHING IN HERE.

121
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,574
WHY DON'T YOU BRING ONE
OF THOSE OUT TO SHOW TO US?

122
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,813
WELL, I CAN THINK OF
A FEW REASONS WHY NOT.

123
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,282
OKAY, FINE, THEN
BRING THE TURTLE OUT.

124
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,983
THAT'LL BE FINE.

125
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,152
OKAY, I'LL GET
YOU A SNAIL.

126
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,321
BUT THAT'S IT, OKAY?

127
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,623
JUST DON'T STARTLE
HIM OR NOTHING.

128
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,693
JUST GET THE --
GOT A FEW IN HERE.

129
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,464
WHAT?
OH! OH!

130
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:07,734
( sigh of relief.)
YOU GO.
OH, THERE

131
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:10,403
[applause]

132
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,607
THAT WASN'T SO
BAD, EH, ED?

133
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,876
DIDN'T YOU
HAVE A WATCH ON?

134
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,578
OH, MY WATCH!

135
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:20,213
[chomp!]

136
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,950
[screaming]

137
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:26,252
ED! ED! ED!
ED! ED!

138
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,654
TAKE HIM DOWN
TO THE LAKE.

139
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,022
HE'LL SWIM AWAY!

140
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,024
PUT HIM IN THE LAKE!
PUT HIM IN THE LAKE!

141
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,393
DON'T WORRY.
DON'T WORRY.

142
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,927
HE'S JUST TAKING
HIM DOWN TO THE LAKE.

143
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:36,462
HE'LL PUT HIM IN THERE,
AND HE'LL SWIM AWAY.

144
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:37,864
[splash]

145
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,265
THERE.
HE'S GONNA BE FINE.

146
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:42,001
[chomp! ]
[ ED screaming]

147
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,104
UH, IT WASN'T FINE.

148
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:48,875
[screaming]

149
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,915
YOU KNOW, GARDENING IS
A LOT OF WORK.

150
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,317
I KNOW BECAUSE I OFTEN ZAP
BY THE GARDENING CHANNEL

151
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,219
BETWEEN GAMES.

152
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,722
BUT YOU KNOW THE THING I
DON'T LIKE ABOUT GARDENING?

153
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,391
WELL, THERE ARE SO MANY,
BUT THE MAIN ONE

154
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,927
IS THAT YOU'RE TOTALLY AT
THE WHIM OF THE WEATHER.

155
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,862
WELL, NO MORE.

156
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:15,401
I CAN DRIVE THIS PORTABLE
GARDEN TO GET THE
WEATHER I WANT.

157
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,136
I CAN DRIVE IT
INTO THE SUN

158
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:20,072
OR SNEAK IT
UNDER MY NEIGHBOUR'S
SPRINKLER FOR WATERING.

159
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,108
HECK, IF THERE'S A
RISK OF FROST,

160
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:25,044
I CAN PARK MY WHOLE
GARDEN IN THE GARAGE.

161
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,381
NOW, I KNOW SOME PEOPLE
GROW STUFF FOR SALADS
AND CASSEROLES,

162
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,249
BUT THEY EAT VEGETABLES.

163
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,051
I GOT A WAY
BETTER IDEA.

164
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,223
TAKE A BUCKET OF WATER.
THROW A LITTLE SUGAR IN --

165
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,525
ACTUALLY,
A LOT OF SUGAR.

166
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,896
THEN YOU ADD
SOME BREWER'S YEAST.

167
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,167
OKAY, MIX THAT STUFF
REAL GOOD IN THERE.

168
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:53,873
THEN WHAT YOU WANNA DO IS POUR
THAT INTO YOUR GAS TANK.

169
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:57,610
THAT'S GONNA BECOME THE
BASE OF YOUR ALTERNATE FUEL.

170
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,816
NOW ALL WE DO IS ADD SOME CORN
FROM OUR PORTABLE GARDEN HERE.

171
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,219
SO FIRST OF ALL,
GET RID OF YOUR GAS CAP.

172
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:09,522
REPLACE THAT WITH A BATTERY
POWERED GARBURATOR,

173
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,157
AND YOU'RE IN BUSINESS.

174
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,199
OKAY, JUST LET THAT FERMENT
IN THERE FOR A WHILE,

175
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,969
AS YOU DO WITH ALL THE TRULY
GOOD THINGS IN LIFE.

176
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,137
AND THEN YOU'RE
GOOD TO GO.

177
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,241
I'LL TELL YOU,
THAT'S THE CHEAPEST
FUEL YOU'LL EVER FIND.

178
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,343
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

179
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,278
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

180
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,582
[engine won`t turn over]

181
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,484
IT MIGHT BE A
LITTLE HARD TO START,

182
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,219
AND ACTUALLY, WHEN IT
DOES GET GOING,

183
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,854
IT SMELLS LIKE
A GIANT TORTILLA.

184
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,490
[engine starts]

185
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:48,528
MAKE SURE YOU DON'T
SIT IN THE UNIT TOO LONG.

186
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,530
YOU COULD GET ROOT ROT.

187
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,507
[applause]

188
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,150
I WANNA TALK TO
YOU MIDDLE-AGED GUYS

189
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,152
WHO THINK IT'S
TOO LATE FOR YOU...

190
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,754
TOO LATE FOR
A NEW CAREER;

191
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,489
TOO LATE FOR SUCCESS;

192
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:20,626
TOO LATE TO APOLOGIZE FOR
WHAT YOU DID IN THE HOT TUB.

193
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,995
AND NOW YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT
QUITTIN' YOUR JOB

194
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,431
AND OPENING A BRAND NEW
FAST FOOD RESTAURANT.

195
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,166
ALL YOUR FRIENDS
SAY YOU'RE CRAZY...

196
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,068
YOU'RE GONNA JUST SAY
GOOD-BYE TO YOUR PENSION,

197
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,803
AND YOU'RE GONNA LOSE
ALL YOUR SENIORITY,

198
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,639
PLUS THE GOOD IDEAS ONLY
COME FROM YOUNG PEOPLE.

199
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,107
ARE THEY RIGHT?

200
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,410
PROBABLY.

201
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:40,313
BUT YOU NEED TO KNOW
THAT RAY KROC WAS 65

202
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,682
BEFORE HE STARTED
McDONALD'S.

203
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,517
AND COLONEL SANDERS
WAS INTO HIS 70s

204
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,954
BEFORE KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN
STARTED SHOWING A PROFIT.

205
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,891
THE MORAL:
FAST FOOD IS GOOD FOR YOU.

206
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:56,062
AND I FIGURE THOSE GUYS ARE
A LOT OLDER THAN YOU
ARE RIGHT NOW.

207
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,130
SO I SAY GO FOR IT.

208
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,566
PEOPLE HAVE PROVEN
THAT THEY LOVE SALT AND FAT,

209
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,069
AND YOU LOOK LIKE
A WINNER TO ME!

210
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,937
REMEMBER,
I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

211
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,139
WE'RE ALL
IN THIS TOGETHER.

212
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:14,580
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T REALISE
HOW SCIENTIFIC MOTORCYCLE
JUMPING IS.

213
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,182
YOU'VE GOTTA TAKE
INTO ACCOUNT

214
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,351
THE BALANCE OF THE BIKE,
THE APPROACH ANGLE,

215
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,620
AND THE THICKNESS
OF THE RIDER'S HEAD.

216
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,255
BUT I THINK WE'RE GOOD
TO GO, RIGHT, MIKE?

217
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,458
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS.

218
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,727
NOW, MIKE, YOU'VE GOT
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

219
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,528
HAROLD AND I HAVE
GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT,

220
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:30,763
DON'T YOU, HAROLD?

221
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,832
WELL, HERE'S HOW
I SEE IT.

222
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:35,668
MIKE, YOU AND THE MOTORCYCLE
HAVE A COMBINED WEIGHT

223
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,570
OF 317 POUNDS.

224
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,238
NOW, WITH OUR LIMITED
GIVEN APPROACH,

225
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:43,009
THE MOTORCYCLE WILL REACH A
MAXIMUM SPEED OF 42.7
KILOMETRES PER HOUR.

226
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,276
ALLOW ME TO SHOW YOU
WHAT WILL HAPPEN.

227
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:45,945
WATCH THIS, MIKE.

228
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,480
YOU'LL FEEL A LOT
BETTER ABOUT THIS.

229
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,849
MIKE, LET'S ASSUME THIS IS
YOU ON THE MOTORCYCLE.

230
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:52,184
AND YOUR GOAL IS TO
LEAP OVER THE LODGE.

231
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,153
THERE'S THE
LODGE THERE.

232
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,489
WE'LL TAKE THIS BACK TO
47.2 KILOMETRES PER HOUR,

233
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,391
AND HERE'S WHAT
WILL HAPPEN...

234
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:08,034
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS.

235
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,703
SEE, THAT'S WHY
I WAS LOOKING AT
THE MOTORCYCLE BOOK.

236
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,205
WE CAN SOUP UP THE
ENGINE AND GIVE IT
A LOT MORE POWER.

237
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,307
WHEN I GET DONE WITH IT
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS

238
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:18,678
WE'RE GONNA GET
HER UP TO 85 mph.

239
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:22,014
THAT'S LIKE A ZILLION OVER
THOSE KILOMETRE THINGS HE
WAS TALKING ABOUT.

240
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,717
SO THIS IS MORE
HOW SHE'S GONNA GO...

241
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,652
SEE LIKE THAT.
OH! OH!

242
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:29,088
OKAY, TOO MUCH.
WE'LL BACK UP.

243
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,790
IT'S GONNA BE FINE,
RIGHT, HAROLD?

244
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,525
IT WENT RIGHT
ACROSS LIKE THAT.

245
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,326
COME ON BACK HERE.
COME ON.

246
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,728
TAKE THE BIKE,
OKAY?

247
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,897
TAKE HER DOWN TO THE GARAGE.
WE'LL WORK ON IT TOGETHER.

248
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,365
WE'LL GET HER
WORKING FINE.

249
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:40,733
COME ON.
JUST GET HER --

250
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,301
AWAY YOU GO.
WE'RE GONNA BE GOOD.

251
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:43,769
WE GOT HER GOOD.
WE'RE GONNA BE GOOD.

252
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,171
EVERYTHING'S GONNA
BE GREAT.

253
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:46,839
OKAY -- NO!

254
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,341
HEY, THAT'S SMART.
MAKE THE BIKE LIGHTER.

255
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,178
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THIS!

256
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,846
OH, MIKE, COME ON.
NOTHING TO WORRY
ABOUT AT ALL.

257
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,414
COME ON,
HELP ME OUT.

258
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,349
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO TO MAKE
YOU FEEL BETTER?

259
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,486
YOU COULD TRY
THE JUMP FIRST!

260
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,521
Red: DALTON AND I WERE GONNA 
HAVE A GAME OF BADMINTON
 

261
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,123
OUT BEHIND THE LODGE. 

262
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,758
WALTER WAS THERE, 
MORE AS A SPECTATOR. 

263
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,259
HE HAD THE LOUNGE THERE, 

264
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,295
AND HE WAS GONNA LIE BACK. 
COULDN'T GET COMFORTABLE.
 

265
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:10,930
NEEDED SOME TYPE 
OF A PILLOW; 

266
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,531
DECIDED TO USE 
HIS OWN SHOES.
 

267
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,966
I DON'T KNOW 
HOW COMFY THEY WERE, 

268
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,468
BUT THEY SURE PUT 
HIM TO SLEEP.
 

269
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,336
AND I HAVE A PROBLEM 
WITH BADMINTON. 

270
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,206
I SEEM TO ALWAYS HIT THE BIRD 
JUST A LITTLE TOO HARD.
 

271
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,042
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. 
LOOK AT THAT! 

272
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,745
THE SHOES CAME 
BACK AND -- OH!
 

273
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:28,280
THIS WAS AN ODD THING, 
BECAUSE WALTER WAS HURTING,
 

274
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,015
YET EVERYTHING SEEMED 
EXACTLY THE WAY IT WAS
 

275
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,284
BEFORE ANYTHING 
HAPPENED TO HIM.
 

276
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,153
LIFE'S LIKE THAT 
WHEN YOU GET OLDER.
 

277
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,088
SO I TRIED TO 
TONE IT DOWN A BIT,
 

278
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,324
BUT I SEE THAT BIRD, 
AND, BAM! I JUST GOTTA --
 

279
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,892
AND IT WENT RIGHT 
UP INTO THE --
 

280
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,560
OKAY, OKAY, NOW, IT'S THE 
ONLY BIRD WE'VE GOT,
 

281
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,262
AND IT'S UP IN THE TREE.  

282
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,797
WELL, THAT'S WHERE A BIRD 
BELONGS IF YOU THINK
 
ABOUT IT.

283
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,532
I'M SAYING, DON'T WORRY. 
JUST RELAX. 

284
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,067
I'LL GET THE RACKET. 
DOWN SHE'LL COME. 

285
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,735
AND... UH-OH! 

286
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,837
ALL RIGHT, GIVE ME YOURS. 

287
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:54,974
WELL, FINE. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. 
YOU KNOW BETTER.  

288
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,676
YOU GO AHEAD, 
MR. SMARTY PANTS.
 

289
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,313
SO DALTON SHOWS US 
HOW EASY THIS REALLY IS. 

290
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,016
JUST THAT SIMPLE, REALLY. 

291
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,952
SO THEN I COME BACK. 
I'VE GOT WALTER'S LOUNGE.
 

292
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,221
DON'T WORRY. 
EVERYTHING'S GONNA 
COME DOWN HERE. 

293
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,690
WHAT COULD 
POSSIBLY GO WRONG? 

294
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,793
STAND BACK, GUYS. 
ALL GONNA COME DOWN NOW. 

295
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,961
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. 

296
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,597
OKAY, WE'VE GOT 
TWO CHOICES...
 

297
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,066
EITHER PLAY BADMINTON 
UP IN THE TREE,
 

298
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,002
OR GET SOMEBODY TO GO UP 
THERE AND BRING IT DOWN.
 

299
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,503
SO WALTER'S THE 
LIGHTEST ONE,
 

300
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,639
SO WE HAVE A LITTLE -- 
JUST STOP. 

301
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,841
GRAB MY ARMS! 
STOP FOOLING AROUND. 

302
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:30,342
ALL RIGHT. 
UP YOU GO, WALTER. 

303
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,077
AWAY YOU GO. 
UP YOU GO. 

304
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,679
UP YOU GO. 
WATCH WHERE YOU STEP.
 

305
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,615
WATCH -- LOOK OUT. 
OH, MY GOSH.  

306
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,017
OH, BOY! 
WOW! 

307
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,752
OW! OW! OOH! 

308
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,353
SO WALTER GETS UP THERE, 

309
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,289
STARTS SHINNYING OUT 
TO THE END OF THE BRANCH 

310
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,558
AND AND ALL HE'S 
GOTTA DO IS GRAB THE --
 

311
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:46,959
GRAB THE RACKETS AND -- 

312
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,260
OH, THERE'S ONE RACKET. 

313
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,662
AND IT STICKS 
RIGHT INTO THE GROUND. 

314
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,797
AND THEN HE -- 
OH! THERE GOES THE LOUNGE. 

315
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,132
WOW! 

316
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,733
OKAY, WE'RE GETTING THERE. 

317
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,302
THERE GOES THE 
OTHER RACKET.
 

318
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:57,636
THEY'RE ALL SET UP. 

319
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,804
JUST GOTTA GET 
THE BIRD NOW.
 

320
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,172
REACH OUT -- OH! 
EASY, EASY, EASY!
 

321
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,575
OH! OH! 

322
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,210
WELL, WALTER, 
YOU DIDN'T GET THE BIRD. 

323
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,678
OH, HERE IT COMES. 

324
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,079
AND... THERE WE GO. 

325
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,290
HI, EVERYBODY.
RANGER GORD HERE.

326
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,026
YOU KNOW, PREJUDICE
IS A TERRIBLE THING.

327
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,662
I DON'T THINK IT'S
RIGHT FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE
JUDGMENTS ON OTHER PEOPLE,

328
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:25,865
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY
DON'T KNOW THOSE PEOPLE.

329
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:28,801
NOW, I GET VERY
UPSET WHEN SOMEBODY
WHO DOESN'T EVEN KNOW ME

330
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,970
CALLS ME AN IDIOT.

331
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,938
IF SOMEONE I KNOW
CALLS ME AN IDIOT,

332
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,074
THAT DOESN'T BOTHER
ME AT ALL.

333
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,742
WHY?

334
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:39,645
BECAUSE THEY'RE
ALL MORONS, THAT'S WHY.

335
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,380
WHICH REMINDS ME,

336
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,282
TODAY'S ANIMATED
EDUCATIONAL FEATURE

337
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:45,451
IS ALL ABOUT LUMBERJACKS.

338
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,086
SO SIT BACK,
ENJOY IT.

339
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,587
I HOPE YOU LEARN
SOMETHING FROM IT.

340
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:49,889
BUT REMEMBER,

341
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:53,259
DON'T CALL ME AN IDIOT,
UNLESS YOU KNOW ME FIRST.

342
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,227
HERE WE GO.

343
00:14:55,261 --> 00:15:00,699
[quirky upbeat music]

344
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,483
TODAY, I'M GOING TO TEACH
EVERYONE ON THE PLANET

345
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,618
ABOUT BEING A
LUMBERJACK,

346
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,287
BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY
IS LUCKY ENOUGH

347
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,122
TO BE AN ACCOUNTANT OR A
FREELANCE PROCTOLOGIST.

348
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,661
OH, WELL,
LOOKY HERE.

349
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:31,130
HERE'S THE LATE
RED GREEN.

350
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:32,798
I SEE IT TIRED YOU OUT

351
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,800
DRAGGING YOUR AXE ALL
THE WAY OUT HERE, HUH?

352
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,769
YOU SEE, HAROLD,
WE HAVE HERE A TREE

353
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,939
THAT IS DEAD AND DANGEROUS
TO EVERYONE WHO PASSES BY.

354
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,675
NOW, LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT
A REAL LUMBERJACK DOES

355
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,576
TO A TREE LIKE THIS.

356
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,445
HAND ME THE AXE,
PLEASE, RED.

357
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,080
NO, IT'S OKAY, GORD.

358
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,015
I'LL GET
THIS BABY DOWN.

359
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,922
YOU KNOW, A REAL LUMBERJACK
WOULD SEE THIS ISN'T A
TREE AT ALL.

360
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,725
IT'S A STEEL POLE!

361
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,827
[hearty laugh]

362
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:06,598
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD'VE
MENTIONED THAT, GORD.

363
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,268
NO! EXPERIENCE IS THE BEST
TEACHER, HAROLD.

364
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,703
COME ON.

365
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:17,142
CLIMBING TREES IS A BIG PART
OF BEING A LUMBERJACK.

366
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,845
HEY, LET'S HAVE A LITTLE RACE,
SHALL WE, HAROLD?

367
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,682
OKAY, READY,

368
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,017
ON YOUR MARK --

369
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,827
YOU SEE,
HAROLD,

370
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,996
IT'S NOT JUST MY SUPERIOR
KNOWLEDGE AND ATHLETICISM.

371
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,964
EQUIPMENT IS A
BIG PART OF IT.

372
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,266
YOU SEE, I HAVE THESE SPECIAL
CLEATS ON MY BOOTS

373
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,569
THAT DIG RIGHT
INTO THE TREE TRUNK.

374
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,005
DO YOU HAVE
THOSE, HAROLD?

375
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,040
UH, NO.

376
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,042

[Harold and Red screaming]

378
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,184
THE LESSON HERE,
BOYS AND GIRLS,

379
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,086
IS NEVER UNDERESTIMATE
JOB SKILLS.

380
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,921
YOU KNOW, JUST BECAUSE
YOU'RE A LUMBERJACK,

381
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,523
OR EVEN A FOREST RANGER,
FOR THAT MATTER,

382
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,425
THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN
YOU'RE A HOPELESS LOSER

383
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,427
WITH NO CHANCE OF
EVER MEETING WOMEN.

384
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:11,196
WELL, IT DOES IN
SOME CASES.

385
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:15,401
[hearty laugh]

386
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,336

00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,915
I GOT SOME GREAT
NEWS FOR YOU.

391
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:33,318
CORDLESS TELEPHONES ARE NOT
JUST FOR THE SUPER
RICH ANYMORE.

392
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,787
OH, NO.

393
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,622
NOW YOU CAN HAVE THAT SAME
FREEDOM AND LUXURY

394
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,690
NO MATTER WHAT LEVEL
OF POVERTY OR SQUALOR

395
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,759
YOU'RE WALLOWING IN.

396
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,429
ALL YOU NEED IS JUST
A NORMAL TELEPHONE,

397
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,964
A COUPLE OF THESE
CONSTRUCTION SAFETY CONES

398
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,232
AND OF COURSE, A RAT.

399
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,437
OKAY, NOW, YOU TAKE
THE HANDSET OFF THE PHONE

400
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,238
AND MOUNT THAT ON THE WALL.

401
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:56,742
AND THEN YOU ATTACH THE
OTHER SAFETY CONE TO
THE LISTENING END.

402
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:59,311
OKAY, NOW YOU PUT A LITTLE
TEETER-TOTTER OVER
THE PHONE HERE.

403
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,813
AND THIS IS WHERE YOU
PUT YOUR CHEESE ON HERE,

404
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,681
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE RAT YOU
TAKE OUT OF YOUR POCKET,

405
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:04,283
AND YOU PUT HIM ON THERE.

406
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,118
WHEN HE EATS THE CHEESE
AND THE WEIGHT PUTS
THE PLUNGER DOWN,

407
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,454
AND YOU'RE READY
TO RECEIVE CALLS.

408
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,389
NOW, I'VE ARRANGED
FOR WINSTON TO CALL

409
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,024
AND GIVE US A LITTLE
DEMONSTRATION.

BIT OF A PROBLEM IN
THE CROWD THERE.

THEY COMPLAINED THEY WERE
SO CLOSE THEY WERE
GONNA GET KILLED.

WHEN WE
MOVED THEM BACK,

THEY COMPLAINED THEY
WERE TOO FAR FROM
THE BATHROOMS.

BUT ALL IN ALL,
IT'S PRETTY EXCITING,
ISN'T IT, HAROLD?

00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,659
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THIS.

DON'T YOU START.

00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:45,984
DID YOU PUT A BIGGER
GAS TANK ON IT?

460
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,854
WHY WOULD WE DO
THAT, HAROLD?

461
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:51,256
WELL, WHEN YOU INCREASE
THE DISPLACEMENT,

462
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,692
YOU INCREASE THE
FUEL CONSUMPTION.

463
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,127
MIKE COULD RUN
OUT OF GAS.

464
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,130
[engine sputtering]

465
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,731
I THINK.
YOU SHOULD CANCEL.

466
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,306
MIKE!
MIKE, ARE YOU OKAY?

467
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,676
Mike: I'M FINE. 
I'M ON THE ROOF!
 

468
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,578
HAROLD, HAROLD,
GET THE LADDER.

469
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,514
IT'S OKAY, MIKE.
WE'LL GET YOU DOWN.

470
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,482
OKAY, YOU KNOW,

471
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:20,986
THERE'S A LESSON TO YOU
YOUNGSTERS WATCHING
OUT THERE...

472
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:25,224
DON'T EVER JUMP A BUILDING
WITH A MOTORIZED VEHICLE,

473
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:28,827
UNLESS YOU HAVE A
REALLY HUGE GAS TANK.

474
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,096
[possum squealing]

475
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,831
OH, MEETING TIME!
MEETING TIME!

476
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,066
MEETING TIME, EVERYBODY!

477
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,400
UNCLE RED!
UNCLE RED.

478
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:36,969
IT'S MEETING TIME.

479
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,737
SHOULDN'T YOU
BE HOLDING THE
LADDER FOR MIKE?

480
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:45,978
YES.

481
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,019
SO IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

482
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,687
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

483
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,089
WE MADE A LITTLE
MISTAKE TODAY.

484
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:58,924
HAROLD AND I THOUGHT THAT MIKE
COULD BE AN ENTERTAINER,

485
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:02,694
BUT YOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T
GO OVER ALL THAT WELL.

486
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,229
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

487
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,732
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND THE
WHOLE GANG AT THE LODGE,

488
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,767
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

489
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,070
[applause]

490
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,039
COME IN, GUYS.

491
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,741
COME IN.
SIT DOWN.

492
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,777
ALL RISE!

493
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:23,615
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI. 

494
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,717
Red: SIT DOWN.

495
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,253
ALL RIGHT, BOW YOUR HEADS
FOR THE MEN'S PRAYER.

496
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,889
I'M A MAN, BUT I CAN CHANGE,

497
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,726
IF I HAVE TO, I GUESS.

498
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,663
OKAY, MEN, NOW THAT WE
KNOW WHAT WE DID WRONG,

499
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,998
WOULD ANYBODY HERE
LIKE TO VOLUNTEER

500
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,767
TO JUMP THE LODGE NEXT YEAR?

501
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:45,671
DALTON, YOU WANNA
JUMP THE LODGE?

502
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,139
OH, I'M SORRY.

503
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:49,608
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
'JUNK' THE LODGE.

504
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:55,614
