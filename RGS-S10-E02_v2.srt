1
00:00:01,801 --> 00:00:03,536
I THINK THE TRICK TO
A HAPPY LIFE

2
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:06,272
IS TO TAKE A BORING JOB
AND MAKE IT FUN.

3
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:09,476
THE EXACT OPPOSITE
TO WHAT Dr RUTH DOES.

4
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:12,545
TO ME TAKING OUT THE GARBAGE
IS THE MOST DEMEANING
REPETITIVE JOB

00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:14,214
OUTSIDE OF POLITICS.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,516
SO I FOUND A WAY TO PUT
A LITTLE ZING INTO IT.

7
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,986
ALL'S YOU NEED IS AN EXTENSION
LADDER AND A SHOVEL.

8
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:22,722
TAKE YOUR SHOVEL
AND DIG A HOLE.

9
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,290
I KNOW DIGGING A HOLE
IS HARD TO DO,

10
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,860
BUT IT'S AMAZING, IF YOU GOT A
LOCAL PROSPECTORS CLUB

11
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:32,198
HOW FAST THEY'LL DIG A HOLE
IF YOU TELL 'EM THERE'S
GOLD DOWN THERE.

12
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:33,800
AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

I'M USING THIS FIRE HYDRANT AS
AN ANCHOR FOR THE WHOLE UNIT.

157
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:55,213
IT'S STRONG,
IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

158
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:59,151
I FIGURE IT'LL COME IN HANDY
WHEN I HAVE MY KITCHEN FIRE.

159
00:06:59,484 --> 00:07:03,021
ALL I DO IS LAY MY BOARDS
OVER TOP OF THESE ROLLERS,

160
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:06,458
AND I'M GONNA PUT 'EM DOWN
WITH THE ROAD SIGNS FACING UP.

161
00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:09,528
THAT WAY IT'LL FEEL LIKE WE'RE
TRAVELLING ALL OVER THE WORLD --

00:07:10,462 --> 00:07:12,331
WELL, ALL OVER MY WORLD.

THOSE OF YOU WHO
STUDIED PHYSICS --

164
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,037
YOU KNOW, AT THE DETENTION
CENTRE OR WHATEVER,

165
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,373
YOU KNOW THAT IT DOESN'T TAKE
MUCH POWER TO TURN A WHEEL

166
00:07:21,406 --> 00:07:23,241
AS LONG AS THE WHEEL
IS BIG ENOUGH,

167
00:07:23,308 --> 00:07:26,011
AND YOU APPLY THE FORCE TO
THE VERY OUTSIDE EDGE.

168
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:29,281
SO I GOT A WIRE BRUSH HOOKED
INTO MY ELECTRIC DRILL HERE

169
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:30,816
AND GOT HER LOCKED
IN THE 'ON' POSITION.

170
00:07:30,882 --> 00:07:33,785
ALL I GOTTA DO IS PLUG HER IN,
AND WE'RE IN BUSINESS.

171
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,387
OH, YEAH, ONE MORE THING.

172
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,788
BE SURE TO RUN
YOUR EXTENSION CORD

173
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:38,323
UP THROUGH THE CENTRE
OF THE UNIT,

174
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,058
BECAUSE IF YOU RUN IT
ON THE OUTSIDE,

175
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,626
THEN WHEN THE PLATFORM TURNS,

176
00:07:41,693 --> 00:07:43,929
THERE COULD BE PROBLEMS.

177
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:46,164

[ CHUCKLING ]

181
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,442
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

182
00:07:57,509 --> 00:07:59,478
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

183
00:07:59,544 --> 00:08:02,013

FOR A SPIN, HUH?

GO GOOD ABOUT NOW?

I KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT MIDDLE AGED MEN.

00:08:31,276 --> 00:08:35,146
THEY ARGUE ABOUT
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING.

OH, YEAH. YEAH.

MIDDLE AGED GUYS CAN'T
LET ANYTHING DROP.

190
00:08:40,085 --> 00:08:42,254
I'VE SEEN GUYS ARGUE
THAT BLACK WAS WHITE

UNTIL THEY WERE
BLUE IN THE FACE.

192
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:47,092
THIS IS NOT A GOOD
TRAIT TO HAVE

IF YOU'RE A MARRIED PERSON.

IF YOU'RE FOOL ENOUGH
TO ARGUE WITH YOUR WIFE,

195
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:56,368
YOU BETTER MAKE SURE THAT YOU
ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

196
00:08:56,401 --> 00:09:00,038
YOU BETTER HAVE A SUPREME COURT

AND YOUR WIFE'S BEST FRIEND
ON YOUR SIDE FIRST,

198
00:09:04,943 --> 00:09:08,480
BECAUSE ARGUING WITH YOUR WIFE
IS LIKE PLAYING POKER.

199
00:09:08,546 --> 00:09:10,315
AND THE MORE YOU DIG
IN YOUR HEELS,

THE HIGHER THE ANTE.

AND THE HIGHER THE ANTE,
THE LOWER THE UNCLE.

I'LL SHOW YOU THE
REST OF THE GUYS.

460
00:21:14,036 --> 00:21:15,338
GREAT.

461
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:17,373
STAY CLOSE NOW.

462
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,176
[ APPLAUSE ]

463
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:26,816
WELL, IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,
AND I'M SURE YOU ARE,

464
00:21:26,883 --> 00:21:30,186
I THINK YOU MADE THE RIGHT CALL
SENDING ME ON THE FISHING TRIP.

465
00:21:30,219 --> 00:21:33,289
I'D RATHER CATCH A BIG ONE
THAN TELL A BIG ONE.

466
00:21:33,322 --> 00:21:36,058
AND THEN BE A BIG ONE.

467
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,127
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

468
00:21:38,194 --> 00:21:40,796
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND
THE WHOLE GANG UP HERE
AT POSSUM LODGE,

469
00:21:40,863 --> 00:21:42,365
INCLUDING CRYSTAL,

470
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:43,733
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

471
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:48,704
[ CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ]

472
00:21:50,373 --> 00:21:52,675
CRYSTAL, YOU CAN SIT THERE.

473
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,278
OH, ALL RISE.

474
00:21:58,014 --> 00:22:00,416
Red: UH, CRYSTAL CAN YOU JUST
EXCUSE US FOR A MINUTE, PLEASE?

475
00:22:00,483 --> 00:22:02,785
Crystal: SURE.

476
00:22:03,085 --> 00:22:05,855
- Dalton: ALL RISE.
-- Red: THERE WE GO.

477
00:22:07,456 --> 00:22:10,393
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI.

478
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:12,461
SIT DOWN.

479
00:22:12,528 --> 00:22:17,566
ALL RIGHT, MEN, BOW YOUR HEADS
FOR THE MEN'S PRAYER.

480
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:19,702
(Red speaking alone)
I'M A MAN, BUT I CAN CHANGE,

481
00:22:19,735 --> 00:22:22,371
IF I HAVE TO,
I GUESS.
