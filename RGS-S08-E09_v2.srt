1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:06,339
THERE'S NO BETTER PLACE TO ENJOY
YOUR FAVOURITE MALT BEVERAGE

2
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:08,341
THAN IN THE GREAT OUTDOORS.

3
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:09,909
UNFORTUNATELY NOW,

4
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:12,245
THE GREAT OUTDOORS DOESN'T COME
WITH BUILT-IN END TABLES

5
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:14,180
AND YOU END UP FORGETTING
WHERE YOU LEFT YOUR BEER.

6
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:15,882
I'VE GOT THE PERFECT SOLUTION.

7
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,951
GET YOURSELF ONE OF
THESE PLUMBER'S HELPERS.

8
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,519
THAT'LL DO THE TRICK FOR YOU.

9
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:20,854
NOW, GO HIGH-END ON THIS.

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,089
GET THE DELUXE MODEL
WITH THE BUILT-IN...

11
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,492
IT'S GOT THE EXTENDABLE CUFF.

12
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:27,193
YOU STICK THAT INTO THE GROUND,

13
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,928
RAM HER IN THERE GOOD

14
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:32,899
AND THERE'S YOUR PERFECT
BUILT-IN DRINK HOLDER.

15
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:34,667
ALWAYS CLOSE AT HAND

16
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:36,803
AND YOU'LL NEVER FORGET
WHERE YOU PUT YOUR BEER.

17
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:41,408
IT'S THE RED GREEN SHOW!!!

18
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:45,111
AND HERE'S A MAN WHO NEVER
SAYS DIE BECAUSE IT JUST
MIGHT BE TRUE.

19
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:46,880
YOUR HOST AND HERO, MY UNCLE:

20
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:48,815
RED GREEEEEN!

21
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,852
[applause]

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,197
THANK-YOU VERY MUCH.
APPRECIATE IT.

23
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:08,268
A BIT OF A DISAPPOINTMENT
UP AT THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

24
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:10,804
WE HAD A FISHING DERBY
AGAINST CARIBOU LODGE

25
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,772
UP THERE ON MERCURY CREEK.

26
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,808
WE CAUGHT MORE FISH,
BUT THEY ENDED UP WINNING.

27
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:17,343
SOMEBODY GOT PAID OFF SOMEWHERE.

28
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,812
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?

29
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:20,980
MOST OF YOUR FISH ENDED UP
GETTING DISQUALIFIED.

30
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:24,551
THEY WERE FROZEN AND STILL HAD
THE PRICE TAGS ON THEM, SO...

31
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:26,453
I DON'T THINK SO, HAROLD.

32
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,655
WE CAUGHT MORE FISH.

33
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:31,458
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE
PENALIZED FOR INGENUITY.

34
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:37,230
TO ME, CHEATING JUST MEANS
YOU CARE ABOUT WINNING.

35
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:41,301
I KNOW A WAY YOU CAN GET
REVENGE ON THOSE GUYS.

36
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:44,304
BECAUSE IT'S NATIONAL
HEALTH CARE WEEK,

37
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,741
YOU CHALLENGE THEM TO
A BLOOD DONOR COMPETITION.

38
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:50,910
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

39
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:52,779
YEAH, A BLOOD DONOR
COMPETITION!!!

40
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,915
ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO
IS DONATE MORE BLOOD
THAN THEY DO.

41
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,951
I DO IT ALL THE TIME.

42
00:01:58,017 --> 00:01:59,686
IT DOESN'T HURT
OR NOTHING.

43
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:02,122
AND THE BEST PART IS...

44
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:08,061
A NURSE COMES UP TO YOU
WEARING A WHITE DRESS
AND WHITE STOCKINGS

45
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,264
AND GIVES YOU JUICE
AND COOKIES

46
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,566
AND RUBS YOUR ARM AND
ASKS HOW YOU FEEL.

47
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,002
NO, HAROLD.

48
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,338
OUT OF THE QUESTION.

49
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:20,073
I CAN'T GIVE BLOOD.

50
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,709
I NEED IT ALL
FOR MY LIFESTYLE

51
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:25,011
AND TO HOLD
MY VEINS OPEN.

52
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:27,013
OH, OKAY.

53
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,848
IF YOU'RE AFRAID,
I UNDERSTAND.

54
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,917
I'M NOT AFRAID.

55
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,053
I'M NOT AFRAID.

56
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,188
THAT'S NOT FEAR
IN YOUR EYES?

57
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,123
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
FEAR IN YOUR EYES.

58
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,058
OKAY.

59
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,960
I TELL YOU WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO.

60
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:44,063
I'M GOING TO CHALLENGE
THE CARIBOU LODGE GUYS

61
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,632
AND IF THEY'RE UP FOR IT,

62
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,100
I'M IN.

63
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,701
YOU THINK THEY
MIGHT REFUSE?

64
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:50,236
I'M BANKING ON IT.

65
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:01,114
IT'S TIME TO PLAY
"THE POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME."

66
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,717
OUR GUEST IS EXPLOSIVES EXPERT,
MR. EDGAR MONTROSE.

67
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:09,923
[applause]

68
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:12,525
TODAY, MR. MONTROSE IS PLAYING
FOR A FANTASTIC GRAND PRIZE

69
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,460
OF A BRAND NEW STEREO RECEIVER

70
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:18,164
SUPPLIED BY SOUPY'S
ELECTRONIC EMPORIUM.

71
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:22,168
[metal rattling]

72
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:26,439
SOME REASSEMBLY REQUIRED.

73
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:30,977
UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO GET MR. MONTROSE TO SAY
THE FOLLOWING WORD:

74
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,346
YOU HAVE TO COVER YOUR EARS,
MR. MONTROSE.

75
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,948
NOT NECESSARY.

76
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,420
TODAY'S WORD IS:

77
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:46,492
ALL RIGHT, HAROLD.

78
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:49,562
GO!!!

79
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,864
EDGAR, EDGAR!

80
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:54,200
THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT'S EASY TO BREAK.

81
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:58,438
MARITAL COMMITMENTS.

82
00:03:58,504 --> 00:03:59,839
NO, NO.

83
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,407
WHAT WORD COMES TO MIND

84
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,676
WHEN YOU THINK OF
BONE CHINA OR CRYSTAL?

85
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,846
OOPS!

86
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:10,316
SAY YOU'RE ON ONE OF
YOUR DEMOLITION SITES

87
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,318
AND THERE'S A LITTLE
FLOWER THERE.

88
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:14,754
A TINY FLOWER WITH
DAINTY LITTLE PETALS.

89
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,689
YOU WOULD SAY
THAT FLOWER IS...

90
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,726
TOAST.

91
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,794
REMEMBER THE OLD
WATER TOWER?

92
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,396
YOU BLEW THAT UP

93
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,832
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN SCRATCH
THE FACTORY NEXT DOOR.

94
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:28,701
YOU MUST'VE BEEN VERY...

95
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,603
EMBARRASSED.

96
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,438
EMBARRASSED?

97
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:36,576
ACTUALLY, I WAS HIRED TO
DYNAMITE THE FACTORY.

98
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,978
OH, OH, OH!

99
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,648
ALMOST RUNNING OUT
OF TIME, UNCLE RED.

100
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:42,949
MOVE IT ON!

101
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:43,950
I'VE GOT IT!

102
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,385
LUNCH HOUR,

103
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,521
YOU TAKE A BREAK AND GO OVER
TO SCHAEFER'S DELICATESSEN.

104
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:49,489
WHAT DO YOU ORDER?  

105
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,491
CORNED BEEF ON RYE.

106
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,426
OKAY, BUT NOT JUST
ANY CORNED BEEF.

107
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,994
YOU ORDER SCHAEFER'S SPECIAL...

108
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,963
DELI CUT.

109
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,099
[ring! ring! ring!]

110
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,109
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

111
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:13,046
THE CARIBOU LODGE GUYS ACCEPTED
OUR BLOOD DONOR CHALLENGE.

112
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,148
[applause]

113
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:16,983
THIS IS SO EXCELLENT.

114
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,652
WE'RE GOING TO
BEAT THEM SO BAD.

115
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,854
HOW DO YOU FIGURE
ON THAT, HAROLD?

116
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,589
YOU GUYS HAVE NEVER
GIVEN BLOOD BEFORE.

117
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,925
YOU'RE RIPE.

118
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,493
IT WILL BE GREAT.

119
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,630
THE BLOOD IS JUST GOING TO
COME GUSHING OUT OF YOU GUYS.

120
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,098
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE?

121
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,399
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

122
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,635
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
SOMEONE STEP ON A GRAPE?

123
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,070
THHHPPLT!!!

124
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:43,643
WE SHOULD RACE DOWN TO
THE BLOOD DONOR PLACE

125
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,512
AND GIVE OURSELVES
A HEAD-START ON THEM.

126
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,081
NO, I CAN'T!

127
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,483
I CAN'T GIVE BLOOD TODAY.

128
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,986
BECAUSE IT'S STILL FULL
OF TOXINS FROM THE WEEKEND.

129
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,555
THAT'LL BE OKAY.

130
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,090
IF ANYTHING IS WRONG
WITH YOUR BLOOD,

131
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,458
THEY'LL TELL YOU.

132
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,592
SO, COME ON.

133
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,094
NO HAROLD, HAROLD!!!

134
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,495
I'LL GO WHEN I'M
GOOD AND READY.

135
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,964
ALL RIGHT?
OKAY.

136
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,433
I DIDN'T WANT
TO SAY ANYTHING, 

137
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,869
BUT I'M NOT FEELING
ALL THAT GOOD.

138
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,271
REALLY?

139
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,940
ARE YOU COMING DOWN
WITH SOMETHING?

140
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,942
I GOT A THROAT THING.

141
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,910
THIS COULD BE THE MUMPS.

142
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,178
FEELS LIKE THE MUMPS.

143
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,279
THE MUMPS?

144
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:21,681
MUMPS ARE BAD.

145
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,516
MUMPS ARE REALLY BAD.

146
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,218
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

147
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:26,853
MUMPS, WOW!

148
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,823
I THOUGHT IT WAS SOMETHING
LIKE THE CHICKEN POX.

149
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:39,031
[clucking like a chicken]

150
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,100
CHICKEN!!!

151
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,668
CHICKEN POX!!!

152
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,971
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

153
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:47,073
I KNEW THAT WOULD
GET HIS BLOOD UP.

154
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,846
OH, THERE ONCE WAS A GUY
NAMED "HARDHEAD MCCALL" 

155
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,315
WHO LIKED TO DO THINGS FAST 

156
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,785
HE RAN LIKE THE WIND
AND ATE THE SAME WAY 

157
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,787
ALWAYS READY
AND FULLY GASSED  

158
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,089
HE HAD A FAST BOAT
WITH 400 HORSE 

159
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,324
I TELL YOU THAT
BABY COULD FLY 

160
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,627
BUT WHEN HE HIT THE BRIDGE
DOING A HUNDRED AND TEN 

161
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,896
HE DECIDED TO GIVE
STOPPING A TRY 

162
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,468
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN MEANING TO
GET THE POSSUM VAN CLEANED UP

163
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:18,471
FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.

164
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,973
I JUST CAN'T JUSTIFY PAYING
FIVE BUCKS AT A CARWASH

165
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,976
WHEN I CAN DO AS GOOD A JOB
AT HOME FOR NOTHING.

166
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,411
AND THEN, WHEN I GET HOME,

167
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,046
I CAN'T JUSTIFY WASHING THE VAN

168
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,215
KNOWING A CARWASH IS EASIER.

169
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,417
IT'S A VICIOUS CIRCLE, ISN'T IT?

170
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,886
SO THIS WEEK ON
"HANDYMAN CORNER"

171
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,122
I'VE COME UP WITH
A SIMPLE SOLUTION.

172
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,959
WE'RE GOING TO BUILD
OUR VERY OWN CARWASH.

173
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:45,131
WE CAN'T GET THE POSSUM VAN
INTO THIS DISHWASHER.

174
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:48,100
MAYBE IF I TAKE THIS OUT...

175
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,036
NO, NO, NO.

176
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:53,105
SO, WHAT I NEED IS
AN EMPTY WATERPROOF BOX

177
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:56,142
THAT'S BIG ENOUGH
TO HOLD THE VAN.

178
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,110
WHICH I BELIEVE
WE HAVE RIGHT HERE.

179
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,447
TO SUPPLY THE WATER
FOR A CARWASH,

180
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:04,250
YOU COULD USE ONE OF THOSE
SPECIAL IRRIGATION HOSES

181
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,919
OR YOU CAN CONVERT
A NORMAL HOSE

182
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,422
USING YOUR LAWNMOWER.

183
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,358
RUMMAGE AROUND IN YOUR BASEMENT

184
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,894
FOR OLD CLOTHES THAT
YOU'LL NEVER WEAR AGAIN.

185
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,230
I KNOW YOU CAN GIVE YOUR
OLD CLOTHES TO POOR PEOPLE,

186
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:20,132
BUT POOR PEOPLE DON'T HAVE
CARS TO WASH, DO THEY?

187
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,834
LOOK AT THIS STUFF, HUH?

188
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,302
SILK TIES.

189
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:24,737
THESE WERE GREAT.

190
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,772
THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST.

191
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,841
BY GOLLY, LOOK AT THESE.

192
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,810
SIZE 30.

193
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,912
REMEMBER THE 60s?

194
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,080
NEITHER DO I.

195
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:40,086
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS ATTACH
ALL THIS STUFF TO THE INSIDE
OF YOUR GARAGE DOOR.

196
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,721
JUST LIKE PUTTING UP
CHRISTMAS LIGHTS.

197
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,556
EXCEPT WITH THESE,

198
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,658
YOU PUT THEM UP ONCE AND
YOU CAN LEAVE THEM UP FOREVER.

199
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,194
SO, IT'S EXACTLY LIKE
PUTTING UP CHRISTMAS LIGHTS.

200
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:52,365
YOU CAN ATTACH THESE ON HERE
WITH SOME METAL RIVETS OR
FASTENERS OF SOME KIND.

201
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,201
OF COURSE, I RECOMMEND THE
HANDYMAN'S SECRET WEAPON:

202
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,404
OH, OH!

203
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:08,781
I GUESS WE'RE DONE FOR TODAY.

204
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,294
SO, YOU WANT TO MAKE THIS
A REGULAR PATTERN ON HERE,

205
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,796
THAT WAY YOU GET EVEN
COVERAGE ON YOUR VEHICLE.

206
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,465
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS PARK
THE VAN IN THE GARAGE,

207
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,467
TURN ON THE HOSES
AND OPEN THE DOOR

208
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,770
AND THESE HOSES
RUNNING ACROSS THE DOOR

209
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,538
WILL WASH THE TOP OF THE VAN.

210
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,675
AND THESE LOOPS HANGING DOWN
WILL RINSE OFF THE SIDES.

211
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,511
ALL RIGHT.

212
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,880
NOW, I NEED SCRUBBING BRUSHES.

213
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,716
SOFT SCRUBBING BRUSHES

214
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,452
MADE OF SILK AND CLOTH.

215
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,254
SEE WHERE I'M GOING?

216
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,822
LET'S START WITH THE WORKPANTS.

217
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,191
LET THE WORKPANTS DO THE WORK.

218
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,928
NOW, THESE ARE GOING TO GIVE

219
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:59,031
THE FRONT AND THE TOP OF MY VAN
A BEAUTIFUL SHAMMY WASH

220
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,734
AND I'VE MOUNTED THESE
BROOMS ON HERE,

221
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,569
SO AS YOU'RE COMING IN,

222
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,505
THAT'LL SCRAPE THE FOOD OFF
FROM THE DRIVE-THRU.

223
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:09,609
LET'S GIVE HER A TRY.

224
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,243
LOOK AT THAT.

225
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,479
ISN'T THAT...

226
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,414
SEE HOW IT WORKS?

227
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,950
I'M NOT GETTING SCRATCHED HERE.

228
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,152
NO SCRAPES, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

229
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:23,990
JUST A COUPLE OF MORE FEATURES.

230
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,559
I'VE MOUNTED A HOSE
RIGHT ONTO THE FLOOR

231
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,995
AND IT'S GOING TO SHOOT UP AND
WASH UNDERNEATH THE VEHICLE.

232
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,496
AND HERE'S A FEATURE:

233
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,065
I'VE GOT SOME HOCKEY STICKS
MAKING RAILINGS FOR US

234
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,669
TO KEEP THE VEHICLE STRAIGHT
WHILE IT'S IN YOUR GARAGE.

235
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,337
YOU MIGHT WANT TO PUT THESE IN,

236
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,640
EVEN IF YOU DON'T
BUILD A CARWASH.

237
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,341
I JUST NEED THE DETERGENT, NOW.

238
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:50,783
I FIGURE THAT ANY DETERGENT
THAT'LL TAKE BAKED CHEESE
OFF A FRYING PAN

239
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,319
WILL TAKE BAKED MOSQUITOES OFF
THE FRONT OF YOUR WINDSHIELD.

240
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:56,589
LET'S LOAD UP THE WORKPANTS.

241
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,660
ONCE YOU'VE GOT YOUR HOSES
ATTACHED TO THE DISHWASHER,

242
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,395
YOU'RE ALL SET TO GO.

243
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,729
SO REMEMBER...

244
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:05,464
"IF THE WOMEN DON'T
FIND YOU HANDSOME,

245
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,500
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY."

246
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,971
EXCUSE ME, IF I LOOK
A LITTLE SMUG,

247
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,306
BUT I JUST SAVED FIVE BUCKS.

248
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:23,182
[water spraying]

249
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:26,686
AND IT ALSO CLEANS THE INSIDE.

250
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:30,856
[running water]

251
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,163
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU OLDER GUYS

252
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,798
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S
VERY, VERY DIFFICULT.

253
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,667
APOLOGIZING TO YOUR WIFE.

254
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:45,237
THIS IS THE TOUGHEST THING
THAT YOU WILL EVER DO.

255
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,973
NOW, WHATEVER THE ISSUE IS,

256
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:54,647
I REALIZE THAT YOU ARE 99.99%
SURE IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

257
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,849
BUT, YOU KNOW SOMETHING,

258
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,786
THAT SHOULD REMAIN
OUR LITTLE SECRET.

259
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,955
YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED
LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW

260
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:06,025
IT'S NOT YOUR JOB TO BE RIGHT.

261
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:10,763
IT'S YOUR JOB TO APOLOGIZE.

262
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,865
AND YOU GOT TO DO IT PROPERLY.

263
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,567
YOU CAN'T JUST SAY:

264
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:18,304
"I'M SORRY FOR EVERYTHING WRONG
THAT I'VE SAID OR DONE
IN THE PAST

265
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,939
AND POSSIBLY SAYING OR DOING NOW

266
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:22,875
OR MAY SAY OR DO AT
SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE."

267
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,543
THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

268
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,378
YOU CAN'T DO THE BLANKET.

269
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:31,117
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS
BE ABLE TO FAKE SINCERITY.

270
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:33,486
NOW, YOU'VE DONE THAT
AT LEAST ONCE BEFORE

271
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:37,790
OR YOU WOULDN'T BE MARRIED.

272
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,458
OH, YEAH.

273
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,695
[applause]

274
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,198
WELL, YOU NEED TO LEARN
HOW TO DO IT AGAIN.

275
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,168
WHAT I SAY YOU DO IS APOLOGIZE
TO SOMEBODY YOU DON'T KNOW,

276
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,270
LIKE A STRANGER YOU'VE
NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

277
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,239
GET YOUR SKILLS UP
AND GET READY

278
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:54,940
AND WHEN YOU THINK YOU'RE READY,

279
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:58,444
LOOK YOUR WIFE STRAIGHT
IN THE EYE AND SAY:

280
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,413
"HONEY..."

281
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,752
"IT'S ALL IN..."

282
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,622
"I JUST..."

283
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:16,896
[laughter]

284
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,397
SORRY.

285
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,232
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YA,

286
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,301
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

287
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:37,883
[laughter]

288
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:42,188
I FEEL A LITTLE
LIGHTHEADED.

289
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,089
YEAH.

290
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:47,560
I'VE NEVER GIVEN THAT
MUCH BLOOD BEFORE.

291
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,295
ARE YOU OKAY NOW?

292
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:50,796
I'M ALRIGHT.

293
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,398
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED THERE, HAROLD.

294
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,600
I STARTED TO GIVE BLOOD
AND THEN I JUST BLACKED OUT.

295
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,101
I THINK THEY TOOK TOO MUCH.

296
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,303
TOO MUCH?

297
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:59,138
THEY TOOK ONE DROP
TO TEST IT.

298
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,706
YOU SAW THAT
AND YOU FAINTED.

299
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,808
YES, YOU DID!

300
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,009
BUT THAT'S OKAY,

301
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,145
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE
YOU HAVE TYPE O BLOOD.

302
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,447
OOOH!!!

303
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,382
OOOOH!
HEY, HEY!

304
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,384
THAT'S WHY.

305
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,353
I WASN'T THE ONLY
ONE TO KEEL OVER.

306
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,888
OKAY, THAT'S TRUE.

307
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,223
A LOT OF THE GUYS FAINTED.

308
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,591
EXCEPT MOOSE THOMPSON.

309
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:22,228
HE GAVE 12 LITRES OF BLOOD AND
ONLY HIS LEFT LEG WAS TINGLING.

310
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:23,629
THAT'S GREAT.

311
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,731
I BET WE'RE BEATING
CARIBOU LODGE ALREADY.

312
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:28,868
NO, THEY'RE STILL AHEAD
BY 10 LITRES OF BLOOD.

313
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,803
I'VE GOT A GREAT IDEA.

314
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,471
I'M GOING TO UP THE ANTE.

315
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,874
I'M GOING TO INCLUDE
ORGAN DONATIONS.

316
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,077
THAT'S GOOD, I LIKE THAT.

317
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,378
SO, HERE'S WHAT
WE'RE GOING TO DO:

318
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,880
YOU'LL KEEP ON
GIVING THE BLOOD.

319
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:43,148
I'M GOING TO GET OUT OF
THAT BUSINESS COMPLETELY.

320
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,884
I'M GOING TO SIGN OVER
MY ORGANS, HAROLD.

321
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,118
THAT'S WHAT I'M
GOING TO DO.

322
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:47,753
I KNOW MY LIVER HAS
A FEW MILES ON HER,

323
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,555
BUT I TELL YOU,

324
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:53,025
MY SPLEEN IS LIKE THE DAY
SHE CAME OUT OF THE SHOWROOM.

325
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,760
THAT'S A GREAT START.

326
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,196
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR HEART,
YOUR LUNGS AND YOUR EYES?

327
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:00,399
I BET YOU GOT A GALLBLADDER
LIKE A BUTTERNUT SQUASH.

328
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,234
WHATEVER IT TAKES, HAROLD.

329
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,136
WHATEVER I CAN DO
FOR MY FELLOW MAN.

330
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,671
LET'S GO DOWN THERE.

331
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,939
YOU GIVE A LITTLE BLOOD

332
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,340
AND I'LL SIGN
MY ORGANS OVER.

333
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,676
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN
GIVE MORE BLOOD TODAY.

334
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,245
HAROLD, IF I CAN SIGN
A PIECE OF PAPER,

335
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,581
THE LEAST YOU CAN DO IS
GIVE A FEW LITRES OF BLOOD.

336
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,954
[narrated by Red]
BILL IS GOING TO DO
A LITTLE GARDENING.

337
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,490
JUMPING UP AND DOWN ON
THE SHOVEL AS HE DOES.

338
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:25,658
CAREFUL, CAREFUL, CAREFUL.

339
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,593
AH, AH!

340
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,994
OH!!!

341
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,166
SO, HE'S CUT OUT THE SOD.

342
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:37,202
HE'S GOING TO ROLL THAT UP.

343
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,637
JUST SET THAT ASIDE.

344
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,172
SET IT ASIDE, BILL.

345
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,540
I SAID SET...

346
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,879
ALL RIGHT.

347
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,581
WE'RE OFF TO OUR USUAL START.

348
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,450
NOW, HE'S GOING TO...

349
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,185
DON'T STEP ON THE FLOWERS.

350
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,020
HE'S GOING TO TILL UP THE GROUND

351
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,789
WITH ONE OF THOSE
SPECIAL THINGS.

352
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:58,724
I HAPPENED TO NOTICE A SIGN.

353
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,427
PERHAPS THIS IS WHY
WE GOT THE LAND SO CHEAP.

354
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:04,763
THE TRANS-CANADA PIPELINE IS...

355
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,966
...GOING RIGHT THROUGH.

356
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,635
BILL, I THINK WE SHOULD
PICK ANOTHER SPOT.

357
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,603
BILL! BILL!

358
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,505
ALL RIGHT.

359
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,240
THIS IS WHAT I'M SAYING.

360
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,775
YEAH, YEAH.

361
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,911
IT'S REALLY...

362
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,879
BILL...

363
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:24,283
IT'S REALLY HARD TO DEAL
WITH 2,000 MILES OF GAS.

364
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,686
WE LEARNED THAT
ON "MEXICAN NIGHT."

365
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,356
THERE WE ARE.

366
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:35,127
BEAUTIFUL JOB.

367
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:39,365
YOU DIDN'T SEAL THE LEAK,
YOU JUST PUT OUT THE FLAME.

368
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,000
THAT'S GAS.

369
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,868
BILL, THAT'S GAS.

370
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,370
WHY DON'T WE JUST LEAVE?

371
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:45,938
LET'S GO.

372
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,606
BILL, I DON'T...

373
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,842
NO, NO, NO.

374
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,511
THAT'S A SHORT-TERM SOLUTION
TO A LONG-TERM...

375
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,680
DON'T JUMP, DON'T JUMP.

376
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,815
[BOOM!]

377
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,587
WATCH OUT FOR THE RAKE!

378
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,022
THE RAKE! THE RAKE!

379
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,957
OH!!!

380
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,392
HERE COMES THE ROLLER!

381
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,860
OH, BILL!

382
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:09,294
OH, OH, OH.

383
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,463
OH BOY, OH BOY.

384
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,732
OH, MY GOSH!

385
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:18,470
THIS IS THE PART
OF THE PROGRAM

386
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,105
WHERE WE LIKE TO EXAMINE
THOSE THREE LITTLE WORDS

387
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,707
THAT MEN FIND
SO HARD TO SAY:

388
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,809
[studio audience]
I DON'T KNOW!!!

389
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,477
IT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT?

390
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,180
JOINING UNCLE RED
IS MR. MIKE HAMAR.

00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:33,352
[applause]

392
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,988
OUR LETTER TO THE EXPERTS
GOES AS FOLLOWS:

393
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,390
"DEAR EXPERTS:
I HAVE A PROBLEM.

394
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,827
I HAVE A BIRTHDAY COMING UP AND
MY HUSBAND IS FAR TOO GENEROUS.

395
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,164
LAST YEAR HE GOT ME
A NEW FOREIGN SPORTSCAR.

396
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,733
THE YEAR BEFORE IT WAS AN
EMERALD AND PLATINUM RING.

397
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,034
WE'RE NOT WEALTHY,

398
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,070
WE CANNOT AFFORD HIS LARGESSE.

399
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,305
HOW DO I MENTION IT WITHOUT
HURTING HIS FEELINGS?"

400
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,607
OH, IT'S SO LOVELY.

401
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,709
WELL, IT MIGHT BE
LOVELY FOR HER,

402
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:02,881
BUT THANK GOODNESS
NOBODY ELSE'S WIFE IS
WATCHING THIS SHOW.

403
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:06,985
WAS THAT SPORTSCAR, EMERALD
RING LADY A LOCAL ADDRESS?

404
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,356
ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA.

405
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,126
THAT'S TOO FAR TO GO.

406
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,762
TOO FAR TO GO TO...

407
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,465
WELL, THEY JUST SEEMED
LIKE SUCH NICE PEOPLE.

408
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,368
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I'LL TELL YOU.

409
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,404
IT'S NOT JUST
THE GIFT, EH?

410
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,739
THE GIFT IS NOT THE BEST WAY
TO SAY YOU LOVE SOMEBODY.

411
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:30,843
YOU CAN DO THAT WITH
A REALLY NICE CARD.

412
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:34,079
HA! HA! HA!

413
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:37,883
NICE TRY, UNCLE RED.

414
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,186
MR. GREEN, THERE'S A BETTER
WAY TO BUY GIFTS, YOU KNOW.

415
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,188
YOU BUY EXPENSIVE STUFF,

416
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:46,125
THEN YOU FENCE IT AND
YOU COLLECT THE MONEY.

417
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:49,595
THEN YOU CLAIM YOU LOST IT
OR IT GOT STOLEN, RIGHT?

418
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:52,030
AND YOU COLLECT FROM
THE INSURANCE AGENT.

419
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,700
THEN YOU BUY ANOTHER
REPLACEMENT PRESENT

420
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:57,936
AND THEN YOU END UP
WITH A BIG PROFIT.

421
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:01,540
OKAY, I THINK
THAT'S A GOOD PLAN,

422
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:05,077
EXCEPT FOR THE GOING
TO THE SLAMMER PART.

423
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,347
WELL, YOU TRADE JAIL TIME
FOR THE PROFITS OF YOUR CRIME.

424
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:09,982
IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD.

425
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:12,618
I MEAN, YOUR TIME FOR
SOMEONE ELSE'S MONEY.

426
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:15,888
IF YOU TRADED THE JAIL
FOR AN OFFICE,

427
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:18,624
THAT'S WHAT STRAIGHT
PEOPLE CALL WORK.

428
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:23,095
[laughter]

429
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,596
IS IT JUST ME, HAROLD,

430
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,533
OR IS MIKE MAKING SENSE HERE?

431
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,668
I'M JUST PULLING YOUR LEG.

432
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,571
A LOT OF PEOPLE
DO THAT IN PRISON.

433
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:36,675
I WOULDN'T WANT ANYBODY
TO BE BREAKING THE LAW

434
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,945
AND GETTING THROWN
IN THE SLAMMER.

435
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,614
I WOULD FEEL JUST
TERRIBLE ABOUT THAT.

436
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,317
WELL, I'M REALLY GLAD
TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

437
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:46,785
SO LISTEN, EVERYBODY:

438
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,320
DON'T GET CAUGHT.

439
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:57,029
[laughter and applause]

440
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,064
COME ON, HAROLD.
I'M OKAY.

441
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,066
YOU CAN DO IT.
I'M OKAY.

442
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,769
YOU'RE ALRIGHT,
YOU'RE ALRIGHT.

443
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:06,305
EASY, EASY, EASY.

444
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:10,142
ARE YOU ALRIGHT? 

445
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,478
ALL RIGHT?

446
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,980
DRACULA!!!

447
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,748
NO, NO, NO.

448
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,217
I'M YOUR UNCLE RED.

449
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:19,518
UNCLE RED?

450
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:22,321
THAT'S OKAY, I GUESS.

451
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,856
HAROLD, YOU DID A GREAT JOB
BY GIVING ALL THAT BLOOD.

452
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:28,460
YOU BEAT CARIBOU LODGE
ALL ON YOUR OWN THERE.

453
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,295
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING?

454
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,497
YEAH, I'M THIRSTY.

455
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,299
WE'VE GOT A BUNCH
OF DRINKS DOWNSTAIRS.

456
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,801
GET YOURSELF SOMETHING.

457
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:38,003
I WOULDN'T MIND A POP
WHILE YOU'RE DOWN THERE.

458
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,172
OKAY.

459
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,241
BY THE WAY, I FORGOT TO
MENTION THIS EARLIER.

460
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,476
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANTED ANY
OF MY ORGANS AFTER I'M GONE,

461
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,578
YOU KNOW, HEART, LUNGS,
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

462
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,914
JUST SAY THE WORD.

463
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,349
I WOULDN'T MIND YOUR BRAIN.

464
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,617
YOU GOT IT BUDDY.

465
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:52,818
OH, THANKS.

466
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:55,754
I FIGURE IT'S BRAND NEW.

467
00:20:55,821 --> 00:21:01,460
[applause]

468
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,297
[squeal of the Possum]

469
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,232
IS THAT MY VEINS OR
IS IT MEETING TIME?

470
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,634
NO, IT'S MEETING TIME.

471
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,068
YOU GO AHEAD.

472
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,037
I'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.

473
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,438
I'M OKAY, I'M OKAY.

474
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:15,607
JUST GIVE A PUSH.

475
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,342
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

476
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,444
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.
