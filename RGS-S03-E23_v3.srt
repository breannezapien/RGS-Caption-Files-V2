RIGHT HERE IN POSSUM LAKE

44
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:48,775

48
00:01:53,212 --> 00:01:56,349
NAME IS HAROLD?

49
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:57,650
>>HAROLD: WELL IT'S A MONSTER

50
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,652
IT SHOULD HAVE A MONSTER'S NAME

00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:02,355
YOU KNOW LIKE GARGO (ROARING)

52
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,222

RAZOR MOUTH, FIRE BEATER.

54
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,361
SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS LIKE

55
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,163
A VIDEO GAME.

56
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:11,964
>>RED: I DON'T KNOW HAROLD

57
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:12,865
I MEAN THE LOCHNESS MONSTER

58
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:14,100
IS NAMED NESSIE SO WE FIGURED

59
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,035
THE LOCH POSSUM MONSTER SHOULD

60
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,703
BE NAMED PESSIE.

61
00:02:17,703 --> 00:02:18,738
WE THOUGHT ABOUT CALLING IT

62
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,406
POSSIE BUT THAT KIND OF IMPLIED

63
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:23,142
THERE WAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM

64
00:02:23,142 --> 00:02:24,310
AND THEN WE WENT THROUGH

65
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:32,118
THE OTHER VOWELS,

66
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:35,788
DECIDED WE WERE SAFEST WITH 'E'.

67
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,557
ANYWAY JUNIOR SINGLETON HAS

68
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:40,426

00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,431
BOAT LAST WEEKEND AND HE'S BEEN

73

TOURS TO PEOPLE COINCIDENCE

75
00:02:49,101 --> 00:02:52,171
OR AND OR WHAT?

76
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,272
>>RED: YES HAROLD BUT YOU KNOW

77
00:02:53,272 --> 00:02:54,607
YOU CAN'T DENY IT JUNIOR SAYS

78
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,242
HE HAS SPOTTED THE MONSTER

79
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,678
EVERY DAY FOR THE LAST 3 DAYS.

80
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,412
>>HAROLD: YES BUT I WISH

81
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:00,313
HE JUST HAD A PAYING

82
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,949
CUSTOMER CONFIRM THAT THOUGHT.

83
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,083
>>RED: WELL HAROLD YOU KNOW

84
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,885
I DON'T THINK ANYONE WITH YOUR

85
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:06,819
LOOKS SHOULD BE SKEPTICAL

86
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:11,724
ABOUT UNUSUAL LIFE FORMS.

87
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,796
TAKE TIME TO READ

88
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:19,498
TAKE TIME TO READ

89
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:21,400
THAT'S A GOOD DEED

90
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,703
TO READ

91
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,604
GO TO THE LIBRARY

92
00:03:25,604 --> 00:03:27,506
AND GET OUT A BOOK

93
00:03:27,506 --> 00:03:29,809
THEY HAVE 2 OR 3

94
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,278
THAT ARE WORTH A LOOK

95
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,180
IF I HADN'T GONE

96
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,615
MY MIND WOULD BE PORRIDGE

97
00:03:36,615 --> 00:03:37,850
AND HOW ELSE COULD I HAVE

98
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,452
FOUND OUT SO MUCH

99
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:43,389
ABOUT CURIOUS GEORGE?

100
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,158
>>RED: THIS WEEK IN

101
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:47,026
'HANDYMAN CORNER' WE'RE GOING

102
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:48,527
TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING YOU CAN

103
00:03:48,527 --> 00:03:49,462
DO WITH SOME OF THOSE BEER

104
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,429
BOTTLES YOU GOT LYING AROUND

105
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:51,464
THE GARAGE OR DOWN IN THE

106
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:52,365
BASEMENT OR WHATEVER

107
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,499
I FOUND THESE BOTTLES IN

108
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,334
THE CUSHIONS OF THE COUCH.

109
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:57,136
NOW ORDINARILY I WOULD JUST

110
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:59,739
THROW THESE OUT OR TAKE THEM

111
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,507
BACK FOR A REFUND BUT I'M GOING

112
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,742
TO SHOW YOU HOW YOU CAN

113
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,709
MAKE YOURSELF A DARNED

114
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:05,978
INTERESTING CLOCK.

115
00:04:05,978 --> 00:04:07,413
NOW THE FIRST THING YOU'RE

116
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,481
GOING TO NEED IS SOMETHING

117
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:09,715
BIG AND FLAT TO HOLD ALL

118
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:12,351
THE MECHANISM FOR THE CLOCK

119
00:04:12,351 --> 00:04:14,987
EXCUSE ME A MINUTE.

120
00:04:14,987 --> 00:04:26,065
(GRUNTING AND CRASHING)

121
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,833
I SUGGEST A FRIDGE DOOR

122
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:28,701
FOR THE TIMELESS LOOK

123
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,803
OF WHITE ENAMEL.

124
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,238
AND YOU'RE ALSO GOING

125
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,539
TO NEED AN ELECTRIC MOTOR

126
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:34,907
LIKE THIS ONE TO FEED THE

127
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,308
BOTTLES INTO THE CLOCK

128
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:37,643
AND YOU'RE GOING TO NEED

129
00:04:37,643 --> 00:04:39,011
A WORK GLOVE JUST ONE THAT'S

130
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:40,279
GOING TO HELP FEED THE BOTTLES

131
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,247
AS WELL SO YOU JUST NEED ONE

132
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:42,248
YOU CAN SELL THE OTHER ONE

133
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,449
TO THE NEIGHBOUR'S KID AND HE

134
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,251
CAN GO OUT AND BE A ROCK STAR.

135
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,552
NOW YOU GOT TO SOAK THIS THING

136
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,020
IN A SOLUTION MADE UP OF MERCURY

137
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,122
LACQUER, RUBBING ALCOHOL,

138
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:53,192
GASOLINE AND PAINT STRIPPER

139
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,260
OR AS WE CALL IT,

140
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:59,164
POSSUM LAKE.

141
00:04:59,164 --> 00:05:01,400
THERE WE GO, ONCE SHE'S DRY

142
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,068
SHE'S HARD AS A BRICK

143
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:04,503
AND YOU STICK THE GLOVE ONTO

144
00:05:04,503 --> 00:05:07,973
A 1 BY 3 OR 2 BY 2 OR WHATEVER

145
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:09,375
SIZE PIECE OF WOOD YOU FIND

146
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,442
WHEN YOU'RE OVER AT YOUR

147
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:11,477
NEIGHBOUR'S GARAGE SELLING

148
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,412
HIS KID THE OTHER GLOVE.

149
00:05:13,412 --> 00:05:14,146
YOU KNOW THAT WOULD MAKE

150
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:16,515
A DANDY LITTLE

151
00:05:16,515 --> 00:05:19,785
BACKSCRATCHER OR LOWER.

152
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:20,619
YOU KNOW A PANHANDLER

153
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:21,987
COULD USE THIS COULD WORK

154
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:23,656
BOTH SIDES OF THE MALL

155
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,623
AT THE SAME TIME.

156
00:05:24,623 --> 00:05:25,691
BUT WE'RE GOING TO USE IT

157
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:26,625
TO PICK UP THE BEER BOTTLES

158
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:27,826
AND THEN ROLL THEM INTO

159
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:29,061
THE FRIDGE DOOR.

160
00:05:29,061 --> 00:05:30,596
SO WHAT WE GOT TO DO NOW

161
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:31,730
IS TO CONNECT THIS TO OUR

162
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,165
ELECTRIC MOTOR JUST STICK IT

163
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:34,299
ON THERE AND YOU'LL HAVE

164
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:35,868
A LITTLE HOLE IN THERE

165
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:38,170
AND YOU CAN JUST DROP A NAIL

166
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,773
THROUGH AND THEN BEND HER OVER

167
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:41,840
OR I GUESS YOU COULD

168
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,808
USE A CAUDER PIN

169
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:44,209
IF YOU'RE MADE OF MONEY.

170
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:45,210
AND THEN WHAT YOU DO IS

171
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,445
LINE HER UP SO IT'S GOING TO

172
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:49,181
GO RIGHT INTO THE FRIDGE DOOR

173
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:50,049
AND I THINK WE'RE LOOKING

174
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:51,049
PRETTY GOOD.

175
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:51,917
WHY DON'T WE PUT A BEER BOTTLE

176
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:56,488
IN THE GLOVE AND GIVE HER A TRY

177
00:05:56,488 --> 00:05:58,757
THERE WE GO.

178
00:05:58,757 --> 00:05:59,658
NOW SOON AS I PLUG THE MOTOR

179
00:05:59,658 --> 00:06:00,859
IN THAT SHOULD JUST LAY THAT

180
00:06:00,859 --> 00:06:01,727
BOTTLE IN THERE AS NICE

181
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:07,566
AS YOU PLEASE.

182
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:10,269
(BOTTLE SMASHING)

183
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:11,737
>>RED: YEAH OKAY THAT WORKS,

184
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:14,573
THAT WORKS EXCELLENT.

185
00:06:14,573 --> 00:06:15,474
IT'S JUST MAYBE JUST A TAD

186
00:06:15,474 --> 00:06:16,642
FAST SO WE'LL SLOW THE

187
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:18,043
ELECTRIC MOTOR DOWN

188
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:18,911
IT'S EASY TO DO YOU JUST

189
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,312
OPEN THEM UP AND YOU CAN JUST

190
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:21,647
START CUTTING WINDINGS UNTIL

191
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:26,218
YOUR WRIST GETS TIRED OR YEAH

192
00:06:26,218 --> 00:06:27,386
WHY DON'T WE JUST HOOK HER UP

193
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:28,654
TO ONE OF THESE HOUSEHOLD

194
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:32,558
DIMMERS, PERFECT.

195
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,960
ALL RIGHT NOW YOU MAY HAVE

196
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,961
TO JIMMY AROUND WITH THE DIMMER

197
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:37,062
TO GET THE MOTOR DOWN TO EXACTLY

198
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:43,101
ONE REVOLUTION PER MINUTE

199
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:44,903
GREENWICH TIME A.M. BUT ONCE

200
00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:46,638
YOU DO BY GOLLY YOU'RE ALL

201
00:06:46,638 --> 00:06:49,875
SET UP AND HERE'S HOW SHE WORKS.

202
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,076
THE GLOVE NOW IS GOING TO PICK

203
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:51,810
UP THE BEER BOTTLE FROM THE

204
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:52,678
BASIN THAT'S OUR SUPPLY AND AT

205
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:53,779
EXACTLY EVERY MINUTE RIGHT ON

206
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:54,913
THE BUTTON SHE BRINGS IT OVER

207
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:55,948
DROPS THE BEER BOTTLE RIGHT

208
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,115
HERE ON OUR TOP SHELF THAT'S

209
00:06:57,115 --> 00:06:58,717
OUR MINUTE SHELF AND THAT

210
00:06:58,717 --> 00:07:00,919
CARRIES ON UNTIL YOU GET 9

211
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:01,820
BOTTLES ON THERE ON THE TENTH

212
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,922
BOTTLE THE WEIGHT ALL CHANGES

213
00:07:03,922 --> 00:07:05,991
AND SHE SWINGS DOWN AND 9

214
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:07,526
OF THE BOTTLES DROP INTO THE

215
00:07:07,526 --> 00:07:09,528
EAVESTROUGH AND CARRY RIGHT ON

216
00:07:09,528 --> 00:07:11,129
BACK INTO THE BASIN FOR A SUPPLY

217
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:12,998
AGAIN BUT THE TENTH BOTTLE GOES

218
00:07:12,998 --> 00:07:15,000
INTO THE 10 MINUTES AREA SO

219
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,402
THAT'S NOW 10 MINUTES AND THEN

220
00:07:17,402 --> 00:07:18,370
THAT KIND OF REPEATS ITSELF

221
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,905
AND NOW WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU

222
00:07:19,905 --> 00:07:21,673
BUILD UP UNTIL YOU HAVE I GUESS

223
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:25,711

224
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:26,545
10 ON THE 10 MINUTES AND

225
00:07:26,545 --> 00:07:29,648
THEN INTO THE HOURS AND

226
00:07:29,648 --> 00:07:31,750
DOWN AND AROUND AND JUST IT'S

227
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,218
LIKE CLOCKWORK AND THE BEAUTY

228
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:34,886
OF THIS MACHINE IS THAT

229
00:07:34,886 --> 00:07:35,954
WHENEVER YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT

230
00:07:35,954 --> 00:07:37,322
TIME IT IS YOU JUST TAKE A LOOK

231
00:07:37,322 --> 00:07:38,657
OVER AT YOUR FRIDGE BEER BOTTLE

232
00:07:38,657 --> 00:07:40,826
CLOCK AND YOU ADD UP THE MINUTES

233
00:07:40,826 --> 00:07:42,060
AND YOU'VE GOT 4 THERE.

234
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,029
SO THAT'S 4 MINUTES PLUS YOU

235
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:46,732
ADD UP THE TENS WE'VE GOT 3

236
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,600
TENS AND THEN WE GOT 1, 2, 3,

237
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,203
4 HOURS SO YOU PUT THEM ALL

238
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:53,071
TOGETHER AND THAT MEANS

239
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:56,141
THAT IT'S EXACTLY

240
00:07:56,141 --> 00:08:00,345

TIME FOR A BEER.

242
00:08:03,582 --> 00:08:04,316
THIS WOULD MAKE A DANDY ALARM

243
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:07,953
CLOCK WOULDN'T IT?

244

00:09:10,248 --> 00:09:13,184
WITH HIS RELATE-IVE-ITY.

00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,889
HE WAS REALLY YOUNG.

MIND GIVING THE KID A HAND

277
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:24,462
HE HAD SOME GOOD IDEAS

278
00:09:24,462 --> 00:09:27,632
THEY WERE ROUGH BUT GOOD.

00:09:31,603 --> 00:09:32,971
HOW IT IS THAT YOU KNOW

ALBERT THAT'S ALL MUCH MUCH

286
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:41,780
FASTER SO WE AGED

287
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,650
AT DIFFERENT RATES.

TALKING ABOUT.

295
00:09:56,828 --> 00:09:58,830
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT TIME

296
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,765
AND SPACE IS RELATE-TIVE

297
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:05,203
AND SUBJECTIVE.

WENT FROM DARK TO LIGHT

303
00:10:15,547 --> 00:10:18,049
IT WENT FROM STRAIGHT TO CURLY

304
00:10:18,049 --> 00:10:20,818
AND EVENTUALLY IT JUST WENT.

305

A SAFE WAY TO STORE THINGS.

468
00:14:49,486 --> 00:14:52,389
PUT EVERYTHING ABOUT THE MIDDLE

469
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:53,257
OF THE BURLAP AND THEN YOU

470
00:14:53,257 --> 00:14:56,593
NEED SOME SORT OF A WATERPROOF

471
00:14:56,593 --> 00:14:57,361
FABRIC TO GO OVER THE BURLAP

472
00:14:57,361 --> 00:14:58,162
YOU BRING THAT UP AND WE WERE

473
00:14:58,162 --> 00:14:59,029

476
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:03,167
(MUFFLED GRUMBLING FROM BILL)

477
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,168
SO WE PUT THAT OVER THE BAG

478
00:15:04,168 --> 00:15:05,102
AND THEN WE TIED HER ON THERE

479
00:15:05,102 --> 00:15:06,170
AND THEN WHAT YOU DO YOU'VE

480
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,171

YOU'RE READY TO GO HANG THAT

483
00:15:09,106 --> 00:15:10,507
NOW OVER THE BRANCH OF A TREE

484
00:15:10,507 --> 00:15:11,708
YOU SEE THE IDEA BEING THIS

485
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:12,843
IS GOING TO MAKE IT HARD

486
00:15:12,843 --> 00:15:16,413
FOR THE ANIMALS TO GET AT.

487
00:15:16,413 --> 00:15:17,648
BILL DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF

488
00:15:17,648 --> 00:15:18,549
MOTOR SKILLS WHEN IT COMES

489
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:19,416
TO SWINGING THINGS AROUND

490
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:24,621
AND THROWING THEM AT PARTIES

491
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:25,522
YOU KNOW NO, NO, NO, NO, BILL

492
00:15:25,522 --> 00:15:26,323
NOW I DON'T LIKE TO BUD IN

493
00:15:26,323 --> 00:15:27,157
BECAUSE BILL IS THE EXPERT

494
00:15:27,157 --> 00:15:29,726
ON THE OUTDOOR STUFF BUT

495
00:15:29,726 --> 00:15:31,328
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THINGS

496
00:15:31,328 --> 00:15:32,262
WOULD PROBABLY GO A LITTLE

497
00:15:32,262 --> 00:15:33,163
BETTER IF YOU THREW THE END

498
00:15:33,163 --> 00:15:35,232
OF THE ROPE OVER RATHER THAN

499
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:36,633
THROW THE BAG OVER.

500
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:37,334
YEAH THEN IT'S JUST A

501
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:38,268
SIMPLE TASK OF PULLING

502
00:15:38,268 --> 00:15:39,970
THAT UP SHOULD GO...

503
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,506
>>BILL: OH!

504
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:43,273
