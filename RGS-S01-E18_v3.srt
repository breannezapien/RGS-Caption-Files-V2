WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

23
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,343
WE DECIDED TO HAVE KIND OF A

24
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:18,544
SAFETY WEEK UP AT THE LODGE THIS

25
00:01:18,544 --> 00:01:19,712
WEEK BECAUSE WE'RE LOSIN' SO

26
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:21,814
MANY FISHING DAYS TO INJURIES.

27
00:01:21,814 --> 00:01:23,383
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU STUB

28
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,851
YOUR TOE ON A CAST IRON STOVE

29
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,286
AND THEN YOU'RE JUMPIN' UP AND

30
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,687
DOWN, AND YOU END UP FALLIN' ON

31
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,122
IT AND GRILLIN' YOUR OWN REAR

32

YOU KNOW, THAT MIGHT BE FUNNY IN

35
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:36,462
HINDSIGHT, BUT BOY, AT THE TIME,

36
00:01:36,462 --> 00:01:38,464
IT'S DARNED INCONVENIENT.

37
00:01:38,464 --> 00:01:39,532
SO WE THOUGHT WE'D HAVE

38
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:40,667
OURSELVES A LITTLE SAFETY WEEK

39
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,135
AND MAKE THE LODGE JUST A SAFER

40
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,903
PLACE TO WORK AND PLAY

41
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,405

00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,372
>> UNCLE RED?

43
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:48,441

00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,342
ARE YOU SAYING TO ME I CAN'T

45
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:50,977
EVEN START AN INTERESTING STORY

46
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:52,145
WITHOUT YOU INTERRUPTING?

47
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:52,845
>> WELL, NO.

48
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:53,513
BY ALL MEANS, IF YOU GOT A

49
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:54,347
INTERESTING STORY,

50
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,314
THEN GO RIGHT AHEAD.

51
00:01:55,314 --> 00:01:56,949
PLEASE ARTICULATE IT FOR US.

52
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:57,583
OH, YEAH.

53
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:58,684
OKAY, HERE'S RED GREEN WITH AN

54
00:01:58,684 --> 00:02:01,487
INTERESTING STORY.

55
00:02:01,487 --> 00:02:02,622
>> SO ANYWAY, WE THOUGHT WE'D

56
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,756
START OFF SAFETY WEEK BY

57
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:05,625
PAINTIN' UP SOME SAFETY SLOGANS.

58
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,859
SO WE GAVE THE JOB TO STINKY

59
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:08,795
PETERSON, BUT UNFORTUNATELY, HE

60

FELL OFF THE LADDER, LANDED ON

64
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,269
BUSINESS, WE LIKE TO CALL IT

65
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,136
A DRAG.

66
00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:18,070
DREARY.

67
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,138
DEPRESSING.

68
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:21,207
IT'S NOT FOR THIS KINDA SHOW.

69
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:22,108
>> WHY NOT?

70
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:23,109
IT HAPPENED.

71
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,343
>> YEAH, WELL, SO DID WORLD WAR

72
00:02:24,343 --> 00:02:26,345
II, BUT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT.

73
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:28,147
THE RED GREEN SHOW SHOULD BE

74
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:29,816
BOUNCY AND ALIVE WITH LOTS OF

75
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,285
VISUAL EFFECTS LIKE THIS.

76
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,720

79
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,724
A NEPHEW, YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT

80
00:02:38,724 --> 00:02:40,126
THINGS LIKE THIS.

81
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:41,027
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST INTRODUCE

82
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:41,661
THE NEXT SEGMENT,

83
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,496

BAFFLING LITTLE TOY

00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,862
THAT FILLED MY HEART

00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:17,897
AND PARTS OF MY LUNG

104
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:20,099
WITH GLEE

105
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,968
I SHOOK IT A COUPLE TIMES

106
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:22,735
FLIPPED IT OVER

107
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:23,436
ONCE OR TWICE

108
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:24,103
AND THEN

109

SORT OF RATTLED IT OFF

CAN YOU IMAGINE MY SURPRISE

112
00:03:29,308 --> 00:03:30,443
WHEN IT TURNED OUT TO BE

113
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,411
A BOTTLE OF GIN?

114
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:41,153
THIS WEEK ON HANDYMAN CORNER,

115
00:03:41,153 --> 00:03:41,954
WE'RE GONNA SHOW YOU

116
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:43,456
HOW TO PREVENT THIS

117
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,291
THAT I HAVE IN MY HAND HERE.

118
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,360
NOW, THIS IS NOT

119
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,729
A CHARCOAL BRIQUETTE.

120
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,399
THIS IS A PIECE OF BREAD, THE

121
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,633
KIND OF BREAD THAT HELPS BUILD

122
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:58,137
STRONG CRAMPS 12 WAYS.

123
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,105
THE REASON IT LOOKS LIKE THIS IS

124
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,272
BECAUSE THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF

125
00:04:00,272 --> 00:04:01,173
BREAD JUST SPENT A LITTLE TOO

126
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:02,975
MUCH TIME IN THIS UNIT

127
00:04:02,975 --> 00:04:04,143
RIGHT HERE.

128
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:05,111
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT

129
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:06,112
HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE ARE TOO

130
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:06,846
CHEAP TO BUY YOU

131
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,781
A DECENT WEDDING GIFT.

132
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,616
BUT TODAY I'M GONNA SHOW YOU

133
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:12,118
HOW TO FIX A TOASTER.

134
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,686
NOW, THE FIRST THING YOU DO IS

135
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,588
TAKE SOMETHING LIKE A FORK OR A

136
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,422
KITCHEN KNIFE,

137
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,323
SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

138
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:18,257
STICK IT DOWN IN THERE AND SEE

139
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:19,792
OF SOMETHING'S KIND OF GOT IT

140
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:20,593
JAMMED IN THERE.

141
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,562
[electricity zapping]

142
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,565
ALL RIGHT.

143
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:28,000
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

144
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,802
THAT TELLS US THE POWER'S ON,

145
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:30,836
BUT I THINK WE SHOULD

146
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:32,838
UNPLUG THIS.

147
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,613
ALL RIGHT.

148
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,647
OKAY, WE GOT HER UNPLUGGED

149
00:04:41,647 --> 00:04:43,282
THERE, AND I'LL TELL YOU,

150
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:44,116
THERE'S ONLY ONE OF TWO THINGS

151
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:44,817
THAT CAN BE WRONG

152
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,452
WITH A TOASTER.

153
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,453
NUMBER ONE, YOU GOT YOUR

154
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,088
POP-TART DRIPPIN'S IN THERE, AND

155
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,023
THEY'VE SEIZED UP THE EJECTION

156
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:53,759
MECHANISM, BUNGED HER ALL UP.

157
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,828
SO WHAT I USE FOR THAT IS THE

158
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,463
WD-40 OR WHAT WE CALL THE

159
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,965
HANDYMAN'S LIQUID WRENCH.

160
00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:01,900
I MEAN, THIS STUFF COULD LOOSEN

161
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,168
THE INTESTINES OF A WARTHOG

162
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:06,272
AFTER A CHEESE DINNER.

163
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:10,042
FIRE THAT DOWN IN THERE, AND

164
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:10,976
NOW, THE OTHER THING THAT COULD

165
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:12,211
POSSIBLY BE WRONG WITH IT IS

166
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,346
THAT THE HEAT SENSOR IN

167
00:05:14,346 --> 00:05:15,481
THE--INSIDE THE UNIT IS STUCK IN

168
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,349
THE "ON" POSITION AND JUST NEEDS

169
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:18,784
SOME OF A JARRING MOTION TO KIND

170
00:05:18,784 --> 00:05:22,154
OF LOOSEN THAT UP.

AT THE LODGE, SO WE THOUGHT WE'D

00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:05,157
CLEAR OUT ALL THE LITTER AND

COUNTIN' UP THE LIFE JACKETS,

234

00:09:45,016 --> 00:09:46,651
UH, YOU KNOW, I CAN SOLVE ONE OF

342
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:48,753
THESE IN JUST OVER A MONTH.

343
00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:49,654
[laughs]

344
00:09:49,654 --> 00:09:50,755
YOU BEAT THAT?

345
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:52,090
I BET YOU I'M THE FASTEST

346
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,625
ON THE FACE OF THIS EARTH.

347
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,826
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, GORD, THERE

348
00:09:54,826 --> 00:09:55,927
ARE SOME KIDS WHO CAN--WHO CAN

349
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:58,429
DO THESE IN ABOUT TEN SECONDS.

350
00:10:17,982 --> 00:10:19,484
>> OH, UNCLE RED, GREAT.

351
00:10:19,484 --> 00:10:20,451
I HOPE YOU'RE IN A GOOD MOOD

352
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:21,786
THIS WEEK 'CAUSE THE LETTERS ARE

353
00:10:21,786 --> 00:10:22,787
OF--CERTAINLY OF A CONTROVERSIAL

354
00:10:22,787 --> 00:10:24,255
NATURE, AND I CERTAINLY DON'T

355
00:10:24,255 --> 00:10:25,123
WANT YOU TO HAVE, LIKE,

356
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:26,124
A HEART ATTACK OR A STROKE

357
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:27,692
OR A BOWEL DISORDER.

358
00:10:27,692 --> 00:10:28,960
>> WELL, THAT'S NOT REALLY

359
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,328
YOUR WORRY, HAROLD.

360
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:31,396
THAT JUST CONCERNS ME AND

361
00:10:31,396 --> 00:10:33,631
THE--AND THE PEOPLE BEHIND ME.

362
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:34,299
>> OKAY, FINE.

363
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:34,966
LOOK, NO PROBLEM.

364
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:35,633
YOU'RE THE BOSS.

365
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:36,401
I'LL JUST--I'LL JUST MOVE

366
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:37,068
RIGHT ALONG.

367
00:10:37,068 --> 00:10:38,836
OKAY, LETTER NUMBER ONE.

368
00:10:38,836 --> 00:10:40,838
"DEAR RED THE POSSUM GREEN,"

369
00:10:40,838 --> 00:10:41,706
THAT'S YOURSELF, OF COURSE.

370
00:10:41,706 --> 00:10:42,941
"I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOUR SHOW

371
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:43,841
FOR TEN WEEKS NOW

372
00:10:43,841 --> 00:10:45,209
AND FIND IT CHAUVINISTIC.

373
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:46,344
NOT ONE OF YOUR GUESTS

374
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:47,145
HAS BEEN A WOMAN.

375
00:10:47,145 --> 00:10:48,246
WHY ARE THERE NO WOMEN

376
00:10:48,246 --> 00:10:49,480
ON YOUR SHOW?"

377
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,315
>> [sighs]

378
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:51,249
HAROLD, WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS

379
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:52,216
A FEW TIMES, HAVEN'T WE?

380
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:52,984
I MEAN, WE'VE INVITED,

381
00:10:52,984 --> 00:10:53,851
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

382
00:10:53,851 --> 00:10:55,153
DOZENS OF WOMEN ON THE SHOW, AND

383
00:10:55,153 --> 00:10:57,288
ALL WE'VE GOTTEN SO FAR IS A

384
00:10:57,288 --> 00:10:58,356
"NO, THANK YOU."

385
00:10:58,356 --> 00:10:59,691
AND WELL, I KNOW A LOT OF WOMEN

386
00:10:59,691 --> 00:11:01,125
ARE NOT ALL THAT INTERESTED

387
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,493
IN OUTDOOR SPORTSMEN-LIKE

388
00:11:02,493 --> 00:11:03,928
ACTIVITIES, BUT WE ARE

389
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:05,930
MORE THAN WILLING TO HAVE

390
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,465
THEM CLEANING FISH OR DOING

391
00:11:07,465 --> 00:11:08,633
LAUNDRY IN THE RIVER,

392
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:09,801
AND ALL WE GET IS NEGATIVE,

393
00:11:09,801 --> 00:11:10,868
NEGATIVE, NEGATIVE.

394
00:11:10,868 --> 00:11:12,837
SO DON'T BLAME ME.

395
00:11:12,837 --> 00:11:13,771
THAT'S NOT MY FAULT.

396
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:15,740
I'M NOT CHAUVINISTIC.

397
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,574
WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING IN OUR

398
00:11:16,574 --> 00:11:18,409
POWER TO EXPAND THE SHOW TO

399
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:19,410
INCLUDE WOMEN.

400
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,478
WE DID THAT FEATURE

401
00:11:20,478 --> 00:11:22,480
ON SHOPPING FOR SHOES,

402
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,948
BUT NOTHING'S WORKING.

403
00:11:23,948 --> 00:11:24,615
I MEAN, THE WOMEN

404
00:11:24,615 --> 00:11:25,616
JUST ARE NOT TUNING IN.

405
00:11:25,616 --> 00:11:26,851
>> WELL, PERHAPS MAYBE IF WE DID

406
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:28,486
SOMETHING THAT WAS MORE IN SYNC

407
00:11:28,486 --> 00:11:29,587
WITH WOMEN, LIKE SOMETHING WITH

408
00:11:29,587 --> 00:11:30,822
WOMEN'S ISSUES INVOLVED.

409
00:11:30,822 --> 00:11:31,522
PERHAPS THEN--

410
00:11:31,522 --> 00:11:32,423
THEN THEY MIGHT TUNE IN.

411
00:11:32,423 --> 00:11:33,091
THAT'S WHAT I THINK.

412
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:33,858
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

413
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:34,725
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I THINK.

414
00:11:34,725 --> 00:11:35,960
>> WELL, WHAT KIND OF ISSUES,

415
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,794
HAROLD?

416
00:11:36,794 --> 00:11:37,895
>> WELL, OKAY.

417
00:11:37,895 --> 00:11:39,997
FOR EXAMPLE, AN ISSUE MIGHT BE

418
00:11:39,997 --> 00:11:41,666
EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK.

419
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:42,633
THERE'S AN ISSUE, JUST SAY.

420
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:43,734
>> WELL, YEAH.

421
00:11:43,734 --> 00:11:44,635
BUT YOU CAN SAY THAT, BUT WHEN A

422
00:11:44,635 --> 00:11:45,937
WOMAN TAKES A MAN'S JOB, SHE

423
00:11:45,937 --> 00:11:47,972
DOES A BETTER JOB BECAUSE SHE'S,

424
00:11:47,972 --> 00:11:48,973
YOU KNOW, TRYIN' TO PROVE A

425
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:49,841
POINT OR SOMETHING.

426
00:11:49,841 --> 00:11:51,943
SO THAT'S NOT EQUAL WORK AT ALL.

427
00:11:51,943 --> 00:11:53,110
>> OH, OKAY.

428
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,645
THAT'S--THAT'S VERY TRUE TOO.

429
00:11:54,645 --> 00:11:55,346
OKAY.

430
00:11:55,346 --> 00:11:56,647
PERHAPS THIS NEXT LETTER CAN

431
00:11:56,647 --> 00:11:58,115
SHED SOME LIGHT ON--ON THIS

432
00:11:58,115 --> 00:11:59,150
SITUATION, BECAUSE IT TOO

433
00:11:59,150 --> 00:11:59,884
IS OF THE SAME NATURE

434
00:11:59,884 --> 00:12:01,085
DUE TO THE PREPARATION WORK DONE

435
00:12:01,085 --> 00:12:01,853
BY YOURS TRULY.

436
00:12:01,853 --> 00:12:03,788
[laughs]

437
00:12:03,788 --> 00:12:05,790
"DEAR RED GREEN,

438
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,424
WHAT THE HELL

439
00:12:06,424 --> 00:12:07,625
DO WOMEN WANT ANYWAY?"

440
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,794
SIGNED, "CONFUSED."

441
00:12:09,794 --> 00:12:11,696
I THINK IT'S A MAN.

442
00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:13,931
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL, HERE AGAIN,

443
00:12:13,931 --> 00:12:14,699
YOU KNOW, YOU HATE TO

444
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:15,433
GENERALIZE.

445
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:17,602
IN FACT, I NEVER GENERALIZE.

446
00:12:17,602 --> 00:12:19,437
BUT I THINK THE PROBLEM STEMS

447
00:12:19,437 --> 00:12:22,306
FROM WOMEN BEING NARROW-MINDED.

448
00:12:22,306 --> 00:12:23,274
>> I DON'T THINK WOMEN ARE

449
00:12:23,274 --> 00:12:23,975
NARROW-MINDED.

450
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:25,109
I THINK YOU'RE NARROW-MINDED.

451
00:12:25,109 --> 00:12:26,110
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I'VE

452
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,111
ABSORBED FROM YOUR DISSERTATION

453
00:12:27,111 --> 00:12:29,146
THUSLY FAR.

454
00:12:29,146 --> 00:12:30,414
>> HAROLD, I DON'T THINK YOU

455
00:12:30,414 --> 00:12:31,816
COULD CALL ME NARROW-MINDED.

456
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:34,318
I MEAN, I PRIDE MYSELF ON BEING

457
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:35,219
THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF

458
00:12:35,219 --> 00:12:36,621
NARROW-MINDED.

459
00:12:36,621 --> 00:12:38,289
>> FATHEADED?

460
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:39,123
I COULD BUY THAT.

461
00:12:39,123 --> 00:12:43,327
I COULD LIVE WITH THAT.

462
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:45,262
>> IN KEEPING WITH SAFETY WEEK

463
00:12:45,262 --> 00:12:47,498
THIS WEEK, BILL WANTED TO TALK

464
00:12:47,498 --> 00:12:49,667
ABOUT FIRE SAFETY.

465
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:51,435
SO HE BUILT A LITTLE FIRE THERE.

466
00:12:51,435 --> 00:12:52,503
ACTUALLY JUST, YOU KNOW, PRETEND

467
00:12:52,503 --> 00:12:53,304
THAT'S A CAMPFIRE.

468
00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:55,039
AND HE--HE WANTED TO DO THIS

469
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,874
KIND OF LIKE ONE OF THOSE FILMS

470
00:12:56,874 --> 00:12:58,109
THEY SHOW IN THE SCHOOLS YOU

471
00:12:58,109 --> 00:13:00,378
KNOW, TO SHOW THE KIDS WHAT NOT

472
00:13:00,378 --> 00:13:01,946
TO DO AND SO ON WITHOUT BEING

473
00:13:01,946 --> 00:13:02,947
REAL DANGEROUS.

474
00:13:02,947 --> 00:13:04,248
SO HE--HE WANTED TO PRETEND I

475
00:13:04,248 --> 00:13:05,950
WAS ASLEEP.

476
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,451
AND HE MADE THAT HIMSELF.

477
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:08,386
NICE JOB, BILL.

478
00:13:08,386 --> 00:13:09,286
NICE. NICE.

479
00:13:09,286 --> 00:13:11,622
HE THINKS THOSE ARE "S"s.

480
00:13:11,622 --> 00:13:12,456
AND THEN HE BROUGHT A LITTLE

481
00:13:12,456 --> 00:13:13,624
FAKE FIRE THAT HE--

482
00:13:13,624 --> 00:13:15,793
GAH, SO THAT HURT.

483
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:19,130
OH.

484
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,231
WELL, HE WASN'T TALKIN' ABOUT

485
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:21,532
INJURY SAFETY.

486
00:13:21,532 --> 00:13:22,199
HE WAS TALKIN' ABOUT

487
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:22,867
FIRE SAFETY.

488
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:23,634
AND HE WAS TRYIN' TO GET THAT

489
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:25,002
THING IN THERE, AND FINALLY JUST

490
00:13:25,002 --> 00:13:26,170
ASKED ME TOLD IT BETWEEN MY

491
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,105
LEGS, WHICH I WASN'T REAL

492
00:13:28,105 --> 00:13:29,974
EXCITED ABOUT.

493
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:31,475
AND THEN WHAT--OH, YEAH.

494
00:13:31,475 --> 00:13:32,143
YEAH.

495
00:13:32,143 --> 00:13:32,943
THIS IS THE FIRST THING YOU CAN

496
00:13:32,943 --> 00:13:34,612
DO TO PUT OUT A FIRE.

497
00:13:34,612 --> 00:13:35,513
>> YIKES!

498
00:13:35,513 --> 00:13:36,280
>> OH, NO.

499
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,249
BILL. BILL.

500
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:39,283
BILL. BILL.

501
00:13:39,283 --> 00:13:40,951
>> [grunts]

502
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:41,752
>> LOT OF PRESSURE.

503
00:13:41,752 --> 00:13:42,486
WE GET A LOT OF PRESSURE HERE

504
00:13:42,486 --> 00:13:44,655
UP AT THE LODGE.

505
00:13:44,655 --> 00:13:46,123
SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE A HOSE,

506
00:13:46,123 --> 00:13:46,991
WHAT DID HE GO?

507
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:47,658
NOW WHAT WAS IT?

508
00:13:47,658 --> 00:13:50,161
WHAT WAS IT?

509
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:51,228
OH, YEAH.

510
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:51,962
I REMEMBER NOW.

511
00:13:51,962 --> 00:13:53,330
YEAH.

512
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,532
THAT WAS A BUCKET OF WATER, I

513
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:58,302
HOPE, AND THIS IS SOME OF OUR

514
00:13:58,302 --> 00:13:59,904
BEACH SAND FROM POSSUM LAKE.

515
00:13:59,904 --> 00:14:01,906
OH, OH, OH, BILL.

516
00:14:01,906 --> 00:14:03,507
BILL.

517
00:14:03,507 --> 00:14:04,141
HOLD IT, BILL.

518
00:14:04,141 --> 00:14:05,943
HOLD IT.

519
00:14:05,943 --> 00:14:07,611
BOY, THAT STUFF ON THE CONTACT

520
00:14:07,611 --> 00:14:10,748
LENSES, LET ME TELL YOU.

521
00:14:10,748 --> 00:14:12,216
SO NEXT--OH, OH, YEAH.

522
00:14:12,216 --> 00:14:13,050
FIRE EX--OH, YEAH.

523
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,785
THESE THINGS--I THINK THIS ONE

524
00:14:14,785 --> 00:14:17,621
HAD A EXTRA HEAVY CHARGE IN IT.

525
00:14:17,621 --> 00:14:18,622
KIND OF GOT AWAY ON HIM

526
00:14:18,622 --> 00:14:19,290
A BIT THERE.

527
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:19,924
HANG ON, BILL.

528
00:14:19,924 --> 00:14:20,591
HANG ON. HANG ON.

529
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:21,258
>> WHOA!

530
00:14:21,258 --> 00:14:26,630
>> I GOT IT. LOOK OUT.

531
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,432
SO WE WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THAT

532
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:29,933
ONE, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S IN

533
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:31,835
BILL'S HAND.

534
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:32,503
NOW HERE'S ANOTHER.

535
00:14:32,503 --> 00:14:33,170
YOU'RE GONNA PUT THE

536
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,038
FIRE--YOU'RE GONNA JUMP ON IT

537
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:34,672
WITH A BLANKET.

538
00:14:34,672 --> 00:14:35,773
THIS IS TO SMOTHER--SMOTHER THE

539
00:14:35,773 --> 00:14:37,074
FIRE AND JUST PACK IT RIGHT DOWN

540
00:14:37,074 --> 00:14:38,976
AND MAKE SURE NO OXYGEN.

541
00:14:38,976 --> 00:14:40,344
UNFORTUNATELY, THE EDGE OF THE

542
00:14:40,344 --> 00:14:41,612
BLANKET WAS GETTIN' INTO THE

543
00:14:41,612 --> 00:14:42,479
REAL FIRE.

544
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:44,148
SO BILL WENT TO GET ANOTHER

545
00:14:44,148 --> 00:14:45,582
BLANKET TO SMOTHER THAT BLANKET,

546
00:14:45,582 --> 00:14:46,550
AND I THINK THIS ONE HAD BEEN

547
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,952
SOAKIN' IN SOMETHIN' OR OTHER.

548
00:14:48,952 --> 00:14:50,154
>> WHOOPS!

549
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:50,854
>> YEAH.

550
00:14:50,854 --> 00:14:52,122
YEAH, THAT WENT UP REAL GOOD.

551
00:14:52,122 --> 00:14:53,290
YEAH.

552
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,658
AND THEN THE NEXT THING YOU

553
00:14:54,658 --> 00:14:55,659
KNOW, BILL HAD A BIT OF A

554
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:56,326
SURPRISE.

555
00:14:56,326 --> 00:14:57,194
>> [laughs]

556
00:14:57,194 --> 00:14:58,262
>> YEAH, YEAH.

557
00:14:58,262 --> 00:14:59,730
YEAH.

558
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,065
AND I GOT THE OTHER FIRE

559
00:15:01,065 --> 00:15:03,000
EXTINGUISHER, BUT YOU KNOW

560
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,667
WHAT'S FUNNY?

561
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:04,668
YOU NEVER--YOU NEVER THINK ABOUT

562
00:15:04,668 --> 00:15:06,170
READIN' THE INSTRUCTIONS ON

563
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,438
THESE THINGS UNTIL YOU

564
00:15:07,438 --> 00:15:08,605
REALLY ARE PRESSED FOR TIME,

565
00:15:08,605 --> 00:15:09,606
YOU KNOW?

566
00:15:09,606 --> 00:15:10,374
PLUS, I HAD THE FRENCH SIDE,

567
00:15:10,374 --> 00:15:12,342
I THINK.

568
00:15:12,342 --> 00:15:13,610
BUT ANYWAY, WE GOT HER.

569
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:14,778
>> [yells]

570
00:15:14,778 --> 00:15:15,446
[coughing]

571
00:15:15,446 --> 00:15:20,083
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I WANTED TO

572
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,752
DO ANYTHING TO, YOU KNOW, PUT

573
00:15:21,752 --> 00:15:23,086
MYSELF OUT FOR A FRIEND, OR PUT

574
00:15:23,086 --> 00:15:24,721
A FRIEND OUT FOR HIMSELF OR

575
00:15:24,721 --> 00:15:27,291
WHATEVER IT WAS.

576
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,126
I DID NOT READ FAR ENOUGH TO SEE

577
00:15:29,126 --> 00:15:30,561
HOW YOU--HOW YOU TURN THE

578
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:31,528
EXTINGUISHER OFF, SO--

579
00:15:31,528 --> 00:15:32,696
[clears throat]

580
00:15:32,696 --> 00:15:33,764
REALLY HAD TO USE THE WHOLE--THE

581
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:37,467
WHOLE CANISTER ON--ON BILL.

582
00:15:37,467 --> 00:15:38,569
THAT WOULDN'T DO ANY DAMAGE

583
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:39,803
ANYWAY.

584
00:15:39,803 --> 00:15:40,504
>> [shouts]

585
00:15:40,504 --> 00:15:41,171
>> OH, OKAY.

586
00:15:41,171 --> 00:15:42,139
WE'RE JUST KIBITZIN' NOW.

587
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:43,440
YOU CAN SEE THAT.

588
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,975
BUT I WAS REALLY JUST TRYING TO

589
00:15:44,975 --> 00:15:46,543
KEEP BILL'S MIND OFF THE INJURY.

590
00:15:46,543 --> 00:15:48,645
>> [moans]

591
00:15:48,645 --> 00:15:50,480
>> DIDN'T WORK.

592
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,316
"IT IS SPRING.

TRYING TO PULL-START

00:15:57,221 --> 00:16:01,491
THE DAMN LAWNMOWER."

597
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:03,961

599
00:16:04,962 --> 00:16:06,496
LONELY, ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT.

600
00:16:06,496 --> 00:16:07,397
>> OH, WELL, I MEAN--

601
00:16:07,397 --> 00:16:08,098
>> CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.

602
00:16:08,098 --> 00:16:08,932
>> YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING?

603
00:16:08,932 --> 00:16:09,600
>> NOPE.

604
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,300
>> WHAT ABOUT THE MOON,

605
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,735
THE STARS, AND EVERYTHING?

606
00:16:11,735 --> 00:16:13,103

00:16:13,103 --> 00:16:14,204
[cries]

608
00:16:14,204 --> 00:16:14,905
I HATE THEM.

609
00:16:14,905 --> 00:16:16,106
YOU KNOW, THEY JUST SIT

610
00:16:16,106 --> 00:16:16,773
THERE.

611
00:16:16,773 --> 00:16:18,141
THEY DON'T--THEY DON'T TALK.

612
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:19,042
THEY'RE NOT LIKE HAVIN' A FRIEND

613
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:19,710
OR ANYTHING.

614
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,477
THEY DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

615
00:16:20,477 --> 00:16:22,079
>> NO, I--I GUESS THE MOON CAN'T

616
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,113
TALK TO YOU LIKE A FRIEND,

617
00:16:23,113 --> 00:16:23,780
COULD, EH, GORD?

618
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,448
>> NO.

619
00:16:24,448 --> 00:16:25,115

620
00:16:25,115 --> 00:16:26,283
>> THEY ONLY SPEAK GERMAN.

621
00:16:26,283 --> 00:16:26,950
>> OH.

622
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,452
>> I TRIED TO LEARN GERMAN ONCE.

623
00:16:28,452 --> 00:16:29,286
[sniffles]

624
00:16:29,286 --> 00:16:30,454
I SENT AWAY FOR THESE

625
00:16:30,454 --> 00:16:31,788
"LEARN GERMAN" TAPES,

626
00:16:31,788 --> 00:16:33,290
AND THEY SENT THESE BACK.

627
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,791
WHAT THE HECK ARE THESE?

628
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,461
THEY DON'T FIT IN MY 8-TRACK.

629
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:38,128
>> NO.

630
00:16:38,128 --> 00:16:39,296
NO, I GUESS THEY WOULDN'T.

631
00:16:39,296 --> 00:16:41,732
WELL, GORD, I'M SORRY.

632
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:42,399
I'VE GOT TO GO.

633
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,166
BUT REALLY GOOD TO SEE YOU.

634
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:43,834
>> OH, NO.

635
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:44,501

637
00:16:45,168 --> 00:16:45,836

639
00:16:46,503 --> 00:16:47,471

643
00:16:49,673 --> 00:16:50,974
THE SUNSET'S GREAT, OKAY?

644
00:16:50,974 --> 00:16:51,641

646
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:53,643
IF YOU YELL AND SCREAM AND BANG,

647
00:16:53,643 --> 00:16:54,811
EVENTUALLY, 1,000 HOURS LATER,

00:16:54,811 --> 00:16:55,479
IT'LL COME UP AGAIN.

649
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:56,313
YOU GOT TO SEE THAT.

650
00:16:56,313 --> 00:16:56,980

00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,039
SEE YOU.

682
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,074
OH, IF YOU NEED SOME TWIGS,

683
00:17:24,074 --> 00:17:24,941
HELP YOURSELF, OKAY?

684
00:17:24,941 --> 00:17:26,109

00:17:51,801 --> 00:17:52,469
YEAH.

700
00:17:52,469 --> 00:17:53,637
YEAH, WE LEARNED ALL ABOUT THAT

00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:54,971
IN SCHOOL.

702
00:17:54,971 --> 00:17:57,140
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

703
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,174
>> WELL, I, YOU KNOW, NOW THAT

704
00:17:58,174 --> 00:17:59,709
YOU'RE GOIN' THROUGH PUBERTY,

705
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:02,112

717
00:18:13,923 --> 00:18:14,924
>> OH.

718
00:18:14,924 --> 00:18:15,859
CONTRACEPTIVES.

719
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:16,726

00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:21,431
ALWAY--ALWAYS BROKE.

724
00:18:21,431 --> 00:18:22,599
IT'S FUN TO THINK ABOUT, THOUGH.

725
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:23,733

THAT'S WHAT YOU MEANT.

740
00:18:37,414 --> 00:18:38,281
>> HAROLD, IF YOU SAY THAT WORD

741
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:39,215
ONE MORE TIME, WE'RE NOT HAVIN'

742

743
00:18:39,949 --> 00:18:41,284
HONEST DISCUSSIONS.

744
00:18:41,284 --> 00:18:45,789

>> DO WE NEED MORE

750
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:51,461
ABOUT SAFETY WEEK?

751
00:18:51,461 --> 00:18:52,228
>> WELL, YOU DON'T WANT TO GET

752
00:18:52,228 --> 00:18:54,330
INJURED, DO YOU, HAROLD?

753

THIS IS HIS HOBBY.

759
00:19:11,948 --> 00:19:12,649
HE'S JUST GONE TO BUY A

760
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:13,683
PROPELLER, AND I THINK HE'LL

00:19:19,989 --> 00:19:20,657
ALL RIGHT?

769
00:19:20,657 --> 00:19:21,391
>> DID I GET THE PROPELLER?

770
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:22,025
>> YEAH.

771
00:19:22,025 --> 00:19:22,792

00:19:23,993 --> 00:19:25,528
THING I ORDERED A WEEK AGO.

774
00:19:25,528 --> 00:19:26,196

00:19:28,164 --> 00:19:29,365
AND IT'S STILL NOT IN.

778
00:19:29,365 --> 00:19:30,200
ONE WEEK.

779
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,301
SO WHAT DID I HAVE TO DO?

780
00:19:31,301 --> 00:19:32,468
I BOUGHT THIS INSTEAD.

781
00:19:32,468 --> 00:19:33,203
>> WHAT THE HELL'S THAT?

782
00:19:33,203 --> 00:19:35,471
THAT'S A CEILING FAN THERE, JIM.

783
00:19:35,471 --> 00:19:36,439
>> THIS IS A PROPELLER.

784
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:37,073
>> OH, NO.

785
00:19:37,073 --> 00:19:37,740
>> THIS IS A PROPELLER.

786
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,108
>> NO, THAT'S A CEILING FAN.

787
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:39,776
>> I KNOW.

788
00:19:39,776 --> 00:19:40,510
IT'S THE SAME BLOODY THING.

789
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,244
>> NO, NO, NO.

790
00:19:41,244 --> 00:19:42,245
JIMMY, I DON'T THINK THAT'LL

791
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:43,279
TAKE THE PRESSURE, YOU KNOW,

792
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:44,581
THE--THE STRESS.

793
00:19:44,581 --> 00:19:46,316
IT'S SPINNING AT THOUSANDS OF

794
00:19:46,316 --> 00:19:47,383
RPM.

795
00:19:47,383 --> 00:19:48,117
THAT'S--I DON'T THINK

796
00:19:48,117 --> 00:19:49,752
THAT'S--THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK

797
00:19:49,752 --> 00:19:50,520
OUT, IS IT?

798
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,521
>> OF COURSE IT'LL WORK OUT.

799
00:19:51,521 --> 00:19:52,188
I MEAN--

800
00:19:52,188 --> 00:19:53,122
>> WELL, JIMMY, SHE'S WOOD,

YOU KNOW.

802
00:19:53,823 --> 00:19:55,124
>> ALL THE BETTER, ISN'T IT?

803
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:56,125
I MEAN, SHE'S WOOD.

804
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,427
THIS IS A WIZENED OLD BOAT.

805
00:19:57,427 --> 00:19:58,661
I MEAN, IF YOU--IF YOU PUT A

806
00:19:58,661 --> 00:20:00,463
METAL PROPELLER ON, THE BLOODY

807

THING COMES OFF, SHE'S GONNA

808
00:20:01,464 --> 00:20:02,432
SINK LIKE A STONE.

809
00:20:02,432 --> 00:20:04,767
YOU PUT THIS ON, THIS FALLS OFF,

810
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:05,435
IT'S MADE OUT OF WOOD.

811
00:20:05,435 --> 00:20:06,169
SHE'S GONNA FLOAT.

812
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:06,936
I CAN PICK UP THE BEST AND FIX

813
00:20:06,936 --> 00:20:07,637
IT ALL OVER AGAIN.

814
00:20:07,637 --> 00:20:08,471
>> BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT.

815
00:20:08,471 --> 00:20:09,105
>> NO TROUBLE AT ALL.

816
00:20:09,105 --> 00:20:09,906
I WAS THINKIN' OF PATENTING

817
00:20:09,906 --> 00:20:10,940
THAT, ACTUALLY.

818
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,874

878
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:28,317
>> SURE, NO PROBLEM.

879
00:21:28,317 --> 00:21:29,652

00:21:29,652 --> 00:21:30,519

00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:31,420
>> NO, NO.

882
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,221
JIM, YOU BROKE THE HAMMER

883
00:21:32,221 --> 00:21:33,122
ON THE TRIPOD.

884
00:21:33,122 --> 00:21:34,457
>> OH, RIGHT.

885
00:21:34,457 --> 00:21:35,892
WHERE'S A HAMMER?

886
00:21:35,892 --> 00:21:36,559
WHAT'S THAT?

887
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,260

888
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,228
>> THAT'S--

889
00:21:45,868 --> 00:21:47,403
>> SO ANYWAY, BY THE TIME WE GOT

890
00:21:47,403 --> 00:21:48,871
EVERYTHING INTO THE LODGE, ALL

891
00:21:48,871 --> 00:21:50,439
THE SAFETY EQUIPMENT, WE DECIDED

892
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:51,574
TO HAVE A FIRE DRILL.

893
00:21:51,574 --> 00:21:52,842
SEE, 'CAUSE WHAT WE'D DONE IS

894
00:21:52,842 --> 00:21:53,843
WE'D GOT ONE OF THEM SMOKE

895
00:21:53,843 --> 00:21:55,544
DETECTORS THAT SOUNDS LIKE 55

896
00:21:55,544 --> 00:21:57,446
SEATBELT BUZZERS ALL GOIN' OFF

897
00:21:57,446 --> 00:21:58,180
AT ONCE.

898
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,216
AND WE HAD PUT ROPE LADDERS UP

899
00:22:00,216 --> 00:22:01,217
AGAINST EVERYONE'S BEDROOM

900
00:22:01,217 --> 00:22:03,152
WINDOW, AND WE HAD SOME OF THEM

901
00:22:03,152 --> 00:22:05,521
SAFETY LIGHTS, NON-EXPLOSIVE

902
00:22:05,521 --> 00:22:06,756
THINGS, AND WE GOT SOME

903
00:22:06,756 --> 00:22:08,557
AUTOMATIC SPRINKLER SYSTEM.

904
00:22:08,557 --> 00:22:10,292
AND WE HOOKED THE WHOLE WORKS UP

905
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:11,861
INTO A COMPUTER THAT MOOSE

906
00:22:11,861 --> 00:22:13,295
THOMPSON HAD MADE OUT OF AN OLD

907
00:22:13,295 --> 00:22:16,132
CLOTHES DRYER CONTROL PANEL.

908
00:22:16,132 --> 00:22:17,533
SO THEN WHAT WE DONE WAS WE ALL

909
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:19,301
WENT TO BED AND PRETENDED WE

910
00:22:19,301 --> 00:22:20,102
WERE ASLEEP.

911
00:22:20,102 --> 00:22:22,605
NOT THE SAME BED.

912
00:22:22,605 --> 00:22:23,672
BUT, YOU KNOW, AND AFTER A

913
00:22:23,672 --> 00:22:24,807
COUPLE OF MINUTES OF PRETENDING

914
00:22:24,807 --> 00:22:26,008
TO BE ASLEEP, SON OF A GUN, WE

915
00:22:26,008 --> 00:22:28,177
WERE ASLEEP.

916
00:22:28,177 --> 00:22:29,278
AND THEN OF COURSE, THE COMPUTER

917
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:30,880
CATCHES ON FIRE, YOU KNOW, BUT

918
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,948
LUCKILY NOW, MOOSE HAD PUT THE

919
00:22:32,948 --> 00:22:34,583
UNIT UNDER THE CUPBOARD WHERE WE

920
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,118
KEEP ALL THE CANS OF INSECT

921
00:22:36,118 --> 00:22:37,186
REPELLANT.

922
00:22:37,186 --> 00:22:38,554
SO AS THE FIRE GOT GOIN', OF

923
00:22:38,554 --> 00:22:39,789
COURSE, THEY GET HOT, AND THEY

924
00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:40,656
START GOIN' OFF LIKE HAND

925
00:22:40,656 --> 00:22:41,357
GRENADES.

926
00:22:41,357 --> 00:22:42,591
I MEAN, IT WAS--IT WAS LIKE THE

927
00:22:42,591 --> 00:22:43,926
VIETNAM WAR EXCEPT IT SMELLED

928
00:22:43,926 --> 00:22:44,960
BETTER AND THERE WERE NO

929
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,495
MOSQUITOES.

930
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:47,530
OF COURSE, THAT WOKE US ALL UP.

931
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,297
EVERYBODY'S RUNNIN' FOR

932
00:22:48,297 --> 00:22:49,198
SAFETY, YOU KNOW.

933
00:22:49,198 --> 00:22:50,566
OLD MAN SEDGEWICK BROKE HIS ARM

934
00:22:50,566 --> 00:22:51,433
ON THE ROPE LADDER.

935
00:22:51,433 --> 00:22:52,902
MOOSE THOMPSON SCONNED HIS HEAD

936
00:22:52,902 --> 00:22:54,904
ON A SAFETY LIGHT, AND STINKY

937
00:22:54,904 --> 00:22:55,571
ALMOST DROWNED FROM THE

938
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:56,772
SPRINKLER SYSTEM, AND OF COURSE,

939
00:22:56,772 --> 00:22:58,007
I SLEPT THROUGH THE WHOLE THING.

940
00:22:58,007 --> 00:23:00,075
BUT THE POINT IS THAT NOW WE

941
00:23:00,075 --> 00:23:01,811
KNOW THE SYSTEM WORKS AND GOLLY,

942
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:03,045
WE CAN ALL--WE CAN ALL SLEEP A

943
00:23:03,045 --> 00:23:04,013
LITTLE EASIER.

944
00:23:04,013 --> 00:23:06,148
SO IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

945
00:23:06,148 --> 00:23:08,217
I'M COMING RIGHT HOME AFTER THE

946
00:23:08,217 --> 00:23:11,187
SHOW, AND I'LL WALK THE DOG.

947
00:23:11,187 --> 00:23:13,022
>> UNCLE RED,

948
00:23:13,022 --> 00:23:14,823
YOU DON'T HAVE A DOG.

949
00:23:14,823 --> 00:23:15,758
>> OH, THAT--THAT'S CODE,

950
00:23:15,758 --> 00:23:16,859

951
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:18,527
