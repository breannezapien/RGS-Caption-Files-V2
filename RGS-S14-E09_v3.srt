WELL, YOU DON'T NEED
A STUPID PUPPET
TO DO THAT.

HEY!

159

JUST STOP IT.

160
00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:45,797
WE MIGHT HAVE
SOME KIDS OUT THERE
WHO ARE ACTUALLY INTERESTED

161
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:48,166
IN BECOMING ANIMAL
CONTROL OFFICERS.

162
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:51,103
SO JUST TALK TO THEM,
STRAIGHT OUT.

IT'S FUNNY SOMETIMES HOW YOU
WANT SOMETHING UNTIL
YOU GET IT.

166
00:08:03,815 --> 00:08:06,852
SOME OF YOU MARRIED GUYS
KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

167
00:08:06,852 --> 00:08:09,421
AND IF YOU DON'T,
YOUR WIFE PROBABLY DOES.

168
00:08:09,421 --> 00:08:11,623
LIKE MAYBE YOU THOUGHT YOU
WANTED FANCY AWNINGS

169
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:13,792
AND A CANOPY
ON YOUR HOUSE,

170
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:15,560
BUT AFTER YOU GOT 'EM

171
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,662
YOU NOTICED HOW THEY STOP
THE LIGHT FROM GETTING IN

172
00:08:17,662 --> 00:08:19,931
AND HOW BIRDS NEST IN 'EM.

173
00:08:19,931 --> 00:08:22,634
HOW MAYBE IT'S PRETENTIOUS
TO HAVE A CANOPY

174
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:25,136
ON A HOUSE THAT
HAS OUTDOOR PLUMBING.

175
00:08:26,037 --> 00:08:27,305
SO NOW WHAT DO YOU DO?

176
00:08:27,305 --> 00:08:28,807
YOU CAN'T LEAVE 'EM
ON THE HOUSE;

177
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:30,909
YOU CAN'T TAKE 'EM
BACK TO THE STORE.

I GUESS YOU COULD LIE DOWN
AND HAVE A GOOD CRY.

BUT I DON'T WATCH DR. PHIL.

180
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:38,917
SO INSTEAD, I'M GONNA
USE THOSE THINGS

181
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:41,353
TO CONVERT THIS
TOTALLY USELESS CAR

INTO AN OFF-ROAD READY,
HOMEMADE JEEP.

FIRST THING YOU WANNA DO,

184
00:08:46,324 --> 00:08:48,193
TAKE OFF
ALL THE FENDERS.

185
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,505
YOU KNOW, I WAS HOPING
I MIGHT GET LUCKY

186
00:09:00,505 --> 00:09:03,141
AND THE DOORS WOULD
FALL OFF AT THE SAME TIME.

187
00:09:03,141 --> 00:09:05,577
I SHOULD'VE USED A PINTO.

188

REALLY RUSTED ON THERE.

192
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:28,233
IS RAISE THE BODY
UP A LITTLE BIT.

193
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:31,569
TO DO THAT, GONNA USE A FEW OF
THESE SCISSORS JACKS.

194
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:34,773
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY
CALL THEM SCISSOR -- OW!

195
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:38,910
OKAY, JUST STICK THESE
THINGS BETWEEN THE AXLES
AND THE FRAME,

196
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,912
AND YOU CAN BE LIKE
AN OIL COMPANY...

JACK THINGS UP
AS HIGH AS YOU WANT.

DOES THIS SAY OUT
OF AFRICA TO YOU?

OR OUT OF RESOURCES,

200

OR JUST OUT OF
THE LOONY BIN.

201
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,996
BUT IT SURE DOESN'T SAY
OUT OF IMAGINATION.

202
00:09:57,996 --> 00:10:02,100
AND IT'S JUST THAT EASY TO
MAKE YOUR VERY OWN,
HOMEMADE JEEP.

203

SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

204
00:10:04,802 --> 00:10:06,738
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

205
00:10:06,738 --> 00:10:09,007
OH, CHECK THIS OUT.

JUST OPEN AND CLOSE,

I DON'T MEAN MISPLACED;
I MEAN LOST.

WHERE TEENAGERS FIND A DOOR

INTO ANOTHER DIMENSION
AND THEY THROW IN A NERDY KID,

LOOKING FOR THE TV REMOTE.

WHAT THIS WAS ABOUT.

LOST THAT."

ABOUT ALL THIS STUFF,

I HAD NO CHOICE

310
00:14:37,007 --> 00:14:38,475
THERE'S AN EXAMPLE
OF THAT RIGHT THERE.

311
00:14:38,475 --> 00:14:40,010
YOU KNOW, IT'S
JUST A SMALL DESK,

312
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,545
BUT BOY, SHE HAD
SOME WEIGHT TO HER.

313
00:14:41,545 --> 00:14:43,881
YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T BE
SURPRISED IF THAT UNIT

314
00:14:43,881 --> 00:14:46,583
WAS MAYBE 40 POUNDS,
YOU KNOW.

315
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,486
THEN I NOTICED
IT HAD THE WHEELS,

316
00:14:49,486 --> 00:14:50,921
HAD THE CASTERS
ON THE BOTTOM.

317
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:52,256
WHY DON'T WE JUST --

318
00:14:52,256 --> 00:14:53,957
I'LL USE THE BULLETIN
BOARD AS A RAMP,

319
00:14:53,957 --> 00:14:56,660
AND THEN WE CAN JUST ROLL
HER UP RIGHT INTO THE VAN.

320
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,162
AND THAT MAKES
A LOT MORE SENSE.

321
00:14:58,162 --> 00:14:59,863
BUT, UH -- SO WALTER
STARTED UP THERE,

322
00:14:59,863 --> 00:15:01,598
BUT HE HAD THE HEAVY END.

323
00:15:01,598 --> 00:15:03,867
SO HE GETS HER UP THERE,
BUT OF COURSE WHAT HAPPENS IS,

324
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:06,703
IT'S THE LAW OF THE LEVER,
THERE'S A FULCRUM EFFECT,

325
00:15:06,703 --> 00:15:08,605
AND WHEN YOU GET THE
WEIGHT OVER THE EDGE THERE

326
00:15:08,605 --> 00:15:11,075
SHE'S GONNA TEETER --

327
00:15:11,075 --> 00:15:15,412
AND, UH, WELL, HAROLD LEARNED
SOMETHING THAT DAY,

328
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:17,381
EVENTUALLY.

329
00:15:17,381 --> 00:15:19,082
SO I FIRED THE
CHAIR IN THERE,

330
00:15:19,082 --> 00:15:20,350
AND WE'RE PRETTY
MUCH READY TO GO.

331
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,352
THANKS FOR
ALL YOUR HELP, HAROLD.

332
00:15:22,352 --> 00:15:23,921
AND, UH, AWAY WE GO.

333
00:15:23,921 --> 00:15:25,222
SO HAROLD CLOSES HER UP,

334
00:15:25,222 --> 00:15:26,924
AND OF COURSE, BUT THE TIME
HE GETS UP TO THE FRONT,

335
00:15:26,924 --> 00:15:28,826
WALTER'S LISTENING
TO HIS MUSIC.

336
00:15:28,826 --> 00:15:30,127
HE'S IN THE
PASSENGER SEAT.

337
00:15:30,127 --> 00:15:32,463
WE'RE A LITTLE
SHORT ON SEATING, HAROLD.

338
00:15:32,463 --> 00:15:34,231
MAYBE IN THE --
JUST IN THE BACK THERE.

339
00:15:34,231 --> 00:15:36,099
I'M SURE THERE'S
A CHAIR THERE SOMEWHERE.

340
00:15:36,099 --> 00:15:37,935
HOW ABOUT THE CHAIR
YOU JUST BOUGHT?

341
00:15:37,935 --> 00:15:40,003
THERE HE IS.
HE'S ALL SET UP.

342
00:15:40,003 --> 00:15:42,472
LOOKIN' GOOD.
YOU'RE GOOD, HAROLD, EH?

343
00:15:42,472 --> 00:15:48,378
OKAY, SO I PROBABLY PEELED
OUT A LITTLE FASTER THAN
I SHOULD HAVE.

344
00:15:48,378 --> 00:15:50,848
THEN I SLOWED HER DOWN
PROBABLY A LITTLE FASTER.

345
00:15:50,848 --> 00:15:53,850
HAROLD, THANKS FOR
DROPPING BY.

346
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,621
THEN I PEELED OUT AGAIN --
THIS TIME THE BACK DOOR IS --

347
00:15:57,621 --> 00:16:01,158
AND OF COURSE
EVERYTHING'S ON CASTERS,

348
00:16:01,158 --> 00:16:06,496
SO HE'S ROLLING ALONG THERE
AND A STOP SIGN GOES BY.

349
00:16:06,496 --> 00:16:08,899
AND WALTER NOTICES
THAT HAROLD'S BACK THERE.

350
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:12,669
AND HAROLD'S
TAKING A NOTE.

351
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:16,773
WHAT'S HE SAYING?
STOP!!

352
00:16:16,773 --> 00:16:18,508
OH, YEAH, I GET IT.
OKAY, I GOT YOU.

353
00:16:18,508 --> 00:16:21,311
BUT THE RAMP,
THE BULLETIN BOARD COME OUT,

354
00:16:21,311 --> 00:16:24,348
AND THEN I SLOWED DOWN,
AND OF COURSE HAROLD --

355
00:16:24,348 --> 00:16:25,782
OKAY, THANK GOODNESS.

356
00:16:25,782 --> 00:16:27,851
THEN HE REALISES THE RAMP IS
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM.

357
00:16:27,851 --> 00:16:29,686
OF COURSE THE DESK GOES UP,
AND SO DOES HAROLD.

358
00:16:29,686 --> 00:16:32,255
AND WE COME AROUND.
NOW, WHERE IS HE?

359
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,457
WHERE IS HE?

360
00:16:33,457 --> 00:16:36,026
HE'S INSIDE
DOIN' A DONALD TRUMP.

361

I CAN'T BE FIRED.
I JUST QUIT.

362
00:16:47,371 --> 00:16:49,406
YOU KNOW, WATCHING TV
USED TO BE EASY.

363
00:16:49,406 --> 00:16:51,641
YOU JUST PLOPPED THE THING
DOWN ON ANY OLD CABINET

OR CRATE OR EMPTY TWO-FOUR
AND YOU'RE DONE.

365

BUT OF COURSE THESE DAYS
YOU CAN'T JUST HAVE A TV.

366
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,950
YOU'VE GOTTA HAVE AN
"ENTERTAINMENT CENTRE."

TO BUY ONE OF THOSE

I'M LOOKIN' TO SAVE
A FEW BUCKS.

I CALL IT MY
REFRIGER-TAINMENT CENTRE.

IT GIVES COLD STORAGE
A WHOLE NEW MEANING.

379
00:17:27,277 --> 00:17:30,580

WHAT ABOUT PETE ROSE?

463
00:20:49,212 --> 00:20:53,349
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

464
00:20:54,117 --> 00:20:55,251
HURRY UP AND SIT DOWN.

465
00:20:55,251 --> 00:20:56,752
SIT DOWN EVERYBODY.

466
00:20:59,088 --> 00:21:00,690
ALL RISE!

467
00:21:03,526 --> 00:21:05,928
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI.

468
00:21:05,928 --> 00:21:07,263
Red: SIT DOWN.

469
00:21:08,197 --> 00:21:10,466
BOW YOUR HEADS
FOR THE MAN'S PRAYER.

470
00:21:10,466 --> 00:21:13,035
I'M A MAN, BUT I CAN CHANGE,

471
00:21:13,035 --> 00:21:15,171
IF I HAVE TO...

472
00:21:15,171 --> 00:21:17,039
I GUESS.

473
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,741
WELL, AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD,

474
00:21:18,741 --> 00:21:20,610
HAROLD DID NOT
WIN THE LOTTERY,

475
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,944
BUT ON THE PLUS SIDE,

476
00:21:21,944 --> 00:21:25,348
HAROLD DID NOT WIN
THE LOTTERY.

477
00:21:25,348 --> 00:21:27,783
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY THAT YOUR
CHANCES OF WINNING A LOTTERY

478
00:21:27,783 --> 00:21:30,620
ARE LESS THAN YOUR CHANCES OF
BEING HIT BY LIGHTNING.

479
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,022
HOW MANY OF YOU GUYS
BEEN HIT BY LIGHTNING?

480
00:21:36,192 --> 00:21:39,428
SO THIS LODGE IS FULL
OF NOTHING BUT WINNERS.
