1
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:05,605
You know, as you get older
you're faced with
two choices...

2
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:07,907
either take down your
full-length mirror,

3
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:10,009
or buy a fitness machine.

4
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:11,811
See, the beauty
of a treadmill is

5
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:13,213
when you get
tired of walking,

6
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:15,148
you don't have to worry about
making it back home.

7
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:16,750
You just stop walking.

8
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:22,188
And start snacking.

9
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:28,428
But after a
week or so now,

10
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,430
your wife and you have
given up on lookin' good

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,298
and you're stuck
with the unit.

12
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:33,800
Can't even give it away,

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,537
because everyone you know
already has one
 they're
trying to unload.

14
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:40,206
That's why they advertise it
as "stores under the bed,"

15
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,842
because that's all you
ever do with it...

16
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:46,246
unless, of course, you can
turn it into something useful.

17
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,815
First thing you have to
do is remove the handle.

18
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,011
Okay, next you
wanna cover the belt

19
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:20,446
with the handyman's secret
weapon, duct tape,

20
00:01:20,446 --> 00:01:22,615
but you put it on
sticky side out,

21
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:25,518
so it's more like the
handyman's secret flypaper.

22
00:01:34,927 --> 00:01:38,364
Oh, and get yourself one of
these sand-filled ashtrays.

23
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:39,999
They're kinda
hard to come by

24
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:42,101
with all the anti-smoking
legislation.

25
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:44,003
But you can usually find a
couple of them

26
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:45,571
in the hospital
waiting room.

27
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:47,140
Or maybe if you
live near the beach

28
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,808
you can get some
sand from there.

29
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:51,210
It'll probably have more
cigarette butts in it.

30
00:02:00,486 --> 00:02:01,954
And there
you have it...

31
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:04,223
your very own
industrial-sized belt sander.

Yeah, I appreciate that.

36
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,561
Bit of a situation this
week up at the lodge.

37
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,796
The flagpole fell down.

38
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:46,132
Well, okay,
it was knocked down.

39
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:48,501
Well, okay,
I knocked it down.

40
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,036
But she went down easy.

41
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,305
I mean, I couldn't have
been doin' over 50.

42
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:55,641
Anyway, the pole flies across
the lake like a javelin,

43
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:57,710
and it hits
Old Man Sedgwick's car,

44
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,313
which, ironically,
is also a Javelin,

45
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,648
and the flag wraps
around him like a diaper.

46
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:05,952
Or, I should say,
like another diaper.

47
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,120
So what I've done is
I've made a claim

48
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,989
on the insurance company
for a new flagpole.

49
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:11,824
It was like 37 bucks!

50
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:13,559
Which would use up
the whole lodge kitty,

51
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:16,429
plus we'd have to
borrow another 30.

52
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,164
Uncle Red!
Yeah?

53
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,199
I just got the response
from the insurance
company.

54
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,034
Doesn't look like
a cheque, Harold.
No.

55
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:23,970
They're not going
to pay the $37,

56
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,738
because it doesn't
exceed our deductible.

57
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:28,040
Well, what is
our deductible?

58
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,810

Well, what's
The Lodge worth?

61
00:03:34,947 --> 00:03:37,116
Well, the land's worth
about $100,000,

00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,351
you know --
Wow!

Yeah, oh, yeah.

64
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,287
Then we've got the lodge
and all the out buildings,

65
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,255
and of course plus all the
work that you've put
in around here.

66
00:03:43,255 --> 00:03:45,891
And that brings it down
to about $9500.

67
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,228
Well, why would
we have $10,000 deductible,

68
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:51,964
on something that's
only worth $9,500?

69
00:03:51,964 --> 00:03:54,767
Well, it's the only
way we could get
insurance.

do that anymore,

self-serve gas.

159
00:08:25,503 --> 00:08:27,005
But it's a simple job,

160
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:28,940
because all the
pieces and hardware

161
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,610
come in the one box.

162
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,713
Maybe two or three boxes would
have been a better move.

163
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:02,040
Okay, now don't
get upset

164
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,975
if the furniture gets a few
nicks and scratches

165
00:09:03,975 --> 00:09:05,810
during the
unpacking process.

166
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,480
Distressed furniture
is very popular.

167
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,348
Like I said, though,
this is a simple project,

168
00:09:10,348 --> 00:09:12,817
because all the
pieces come pre-cut

169
00:09:12,817 --> 00:09:14,919
and pre-drilled.

170
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:17,489
You even get all
the necessary hardware.

171
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:21,726
Heck, it comes with
detailed instructions.

172
00:09:21,726 --> 00:09:25,163
I believe this will be a
Swedish-style coffee table

173
00:09:25,163 --> 00:09:27,399
because it was
a Swedish store.

174
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,701
I don't know why
all the Swedish stores

175
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:31,069
sell their stuff
in kit form,

176
00:09:31,069 --> 00:09:32,737
rather than
make it for you.

177
00:09:32,737 --> 00:09:34,672
Maybe with the free love,

178
00:09:34,672 --> 00:09:37,842
the Swedish furniture
makers all go home early?

179
00:09:37,842 --> 00:09:40,645
Okay, we're ready
to start assembling it.

180
00:09:40,645 --> 00:09:44,048
Just check the pre-drilled
holes in the pre-fab pieces

181
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:46,885
until you get
a few to match up.

182
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:48,686
There, that's better.

183
00:09:48,686 --> 00:09:50,655
Okay, now, just make
sure that the screw

184
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:52,991
isn't longer than
the hole it's going into.

185
00:09:52,991 --> 00:09:54,993
Otherwise, the point will
come out the other side,

186
00:09:54,993 --> 00:09:56,694
and that can
be a real pain,

187
00:09:56,694 --> 00:09:59,230
especially if you're
building a loveseat.

188
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,166
Once you get the first
two pieces together,

189
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,968
just keep adding on
until you run out of parts.

190
00:10:03,968 --> 00:10:05,603
If you run out
of hardware,

191
00:10:05,603 --> 00:10:07,939
that's never a problem.

192
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:25,223
Well, I got nothing
to worry about.

193
00:10:25,223 --> 00:10:27,358
I got hardware left over.

194
00:10:27,358 --> 00:10:28,993
You know,
that happens to me

195
00:10:28,993 --> 00:10:31,062
every time I put
furniture together.

196
00:10:34,465 --> 00:10:37,368
But I got the coffee table
put together no problem.

197
00:10:37,368 --> 00:10:39,404
Kind of an
odd looking unit.

198
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:41,272
It's that modern style
of furniture

199
00:10:41,272 --> 00:10:43,574
that Swedish
people go for.

200
00:10:43,574 --> 00:10:45,009
Not really my taste,

201
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:47,345
but then,
I don't drive a Volvo.

202
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:48,646
And it's just that easy.

203
00:10:48,646 --> 00:10:50,882
So remember, if the women
don't find you handsome,

204
00:10:50,882 --> 00:10:53,384
they should at least
find you put together.

205
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:55,053
Oh!

206
00:10:55,053 --> 00:10:56,854
And if you ever
need spare parts

207
00:10:56,854 --> 00:10:58,156
or have any problems.

208
00:10:58,156 --> 00:11:00,358
They usually put the company
phone number and address

209
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:02,427
on the bottom of
the instruction sheet.

210
00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:04,329
Huh!

211
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:06,898
Says here this is
a bunk bed.

[ APPLAUSE ]

213
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,480
The other day I went
to the mall with Bernice.

214
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,382
Let's just say
I lost a bet

215
00:11:24,382 --> 00:11:26,217
and leave it at that.

216
00:11:26,217 --> 00:11:28,252
Anyway, we're walkin'
by this store

217
00:11:28,252 --> 00:11:29,854
and I see a pair
of jeans for sale

218
00:11:29,854 --> 00:11:31,589
that were already
faded and dirty

219
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:33,424
and runnin' ragged
at the cuff.

220
00:11:33,424 --> 00:11:36,494
And this wasn't a
used clothing store,
you understand.

221
00:11:36,494 --> 00:11:39,897
These were 100 bucks
worth of brand new.

222
00:11:39,897 --> 00:11:42,366
I couldn't
figure this out.

223
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:44,602
I mean, imagine
buying a new car

224
00:11:44,602 --> 00:11:48,039
with rust and dents
and bullet holes in it --

225
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,474
that'd be kinda cool...

226
00:11:49,474 --> 00:11:50,908
Anyway.

227
00:11:50,908 --> 00:11:52,810
So I stopped the
first teenager I saw,

228
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,412
and I asked her
to explain it.

229
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:55,613
Well, I learned
two things...

230
00:11:55,613 --> 00:12:00,518
number 1: kids in malls
talk like merchant marines;

231
00:12:00,518 --> 00:12:03,020
number 2: these same kids
will pay more for stuff

232
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,223
that has that
"lived-in" look,

233
00:12:05,223 --> 00:12:08,192
because lookin'
"lived in" is cool.

234
00:12:08,192 --> 00:12:11,529
Well, that made me
feel real good.

235
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:15,266
I realised, hey,
I'm not out, I'm in.

236
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:17,235
Here's all of us
middle aged guys

237
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:19,637
checking out these teenagers
with their smooth skin

238
00:12:19,637 --> 00:12:22,306
and full heads
of purple hair

239
00:12:22,306 --> 00:12:23,908
and feeling jealous,

240
00:12:23,908 --> 00:12:25,643
when they should
be jealous of us.

241
00:12:25,643 --> 00:12:28,646
We're the ones with
that lived-in look.

242
00:12:28,646 --> 00:12:33,651
And we don't even need to
wearin' clothes to
pull it off!

243
00:12:33,651 --> 00:12:37,054
Heck, most of us are
so lived in we're worn out.

244
00:12:37,054 --> 00:12:38,990
Remember,
I'm pullin' for you.

245
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,359

you have the right stuff...

Well, it's all done.

251

I'm officially the
insurer of the lodge.

Uncle Red!
Yeah?

255
00:13:09,186 --> 00:13:11,122
Are you sure you've
thought this through?

256
00:13:11,122 --> 00:13:13,524
No time for that
at my age, Harold.

257
00:13:13,524 --> 00:13:15,159
You know,
the $10,000 deductible

258
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:17,094
will only save you from
paying property damage.

259
00:13:17,094 --> 00:13:19,063
You know, there's personal
injury and accidental death

260
00:13:19,063 --> 00:13:20,631
that you're gonna
have to worry about.

261
00:13:20,631 --> 00:13:21,999
Oh, no, Harold,

262
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:23,501
when a guy makes a
decision to join
the Lodge,

263
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:25,736
he's already an
accident.

264
00:13:25,736 --> 00:13:27,104
If somebody dies,

265
00:13:27,104 --> 00:13:28,639
they're not gonna come
lookin' for a cheque.

266
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,008
No, no, they won't,
but their lawyers will.

267
00:13:31,008 --> 00:13:33,043
That's why insurance
is so expensive.

268
00:13:33,043 --> 00:13:34,512
Well, I don't have
to worry about that.

269
00:13:34,512 --> 00:13:35,846
Oh, no?
Yeah. Yeah.

270
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:37,781
You know, Uncle Red,
lawyers are smarter
than you.

271
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:40,451
Yeah, okay, well,
when you're not smart
enough to be a lawyer,

272
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:43,254
you become a judge.

273
00:13:43,254 --> 00:13:45,156
And my judgment was
to get all the guys

274
00:13:45,156 --> 00:13:46,790
to sign this waiver

275
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,792
that guarantees they
will never take
legal action

276
00:13:48,792 --> 00:13:50,995
against me
or the Lodge.

277
00:13:50,995 --> 00:13:52,663
I need you to
sign this too.

278
00:13:52,663 --> 00:13:54,431
You mind if
I read it first?

279
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:57,801
It never ends with you,
does it, Harold?

an insurance claim.

against my knee.

SO HAROLD AND WALTER
HAD DECIDED TO

290
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:32,803
TAKE A LITTLE TRIP
TO THE BEACH,

NO PROBLEM WITH THE U.V.,

BUT HAROLD WAS SOCKING

PRETTY GOOD.

AND, UH --
THAT WAS UNFORTUNATE.

IT WAS ACTUALLY -- I BELIEVE
THAT WAS A BEACH UMBRELLA,

WHICH THEY HAD FORGOTTEN
TO PUT IN THE TRUNK.

HE'S NEVER ANGRY,

BUT SOMETIMES
HE PRETENDS TO BE.

00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:03,500
THEN HE PAYS THE PRICE.

303
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,136
SO WALTER OPENS
THE TRUNK,

OF STUFF IN THERE.

AND MAYBE IF HE TOOK
THE WHOLE REEL AND
EVERYTHING OFF,

00:16:42,966 --> 00:16:45,602
THAT WOULD PROBABLY
