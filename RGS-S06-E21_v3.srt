IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

2
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:07,941
HERE'S THE MAN'S MAN,
A LADIES' MAN,

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:09,943
THE MAN OF THE PEOPLE,
MAN, OH, MAN!

4
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:12,345
YOUR HERO, MY UNCLE, RED GREEN!

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,214
(Applause and cheering)

6
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:15,715
(Whistling)

7
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:17,717
THANK YOU!

8
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:19,953
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,888
APPRECIATE IT -- THANK YOU.

10
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:23,723
WELCOME TO POSSUM LODGE,

11
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:25,458
WHERE CIVILIZATION MEETS NATURE

12
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,726
AND NATURE LOSES.

13
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,695
HEY, HAROLD.

14
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,563
GUESS WHAT WE'RE UP TO TONIGHT.

15
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:32,565
HERE'S A HINT.

16
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:35,201
(Audience laughing)

17
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,140
GONNA BE FILLING THE CRACKS
IN THE WALLS?

18
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,348
DEMONSTRATE HOW SPIDERS
BUILD THEIR HOMES?

19
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:50,884
NO.

20
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,489
GONNA BE ACTING STUPID
AND IMMATURE?

21
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:59,159
YEAH, HE GOT IT.

22
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,027
ABOUT A MONTH AGO,
JUNIOR SINGLETON

23
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:03,730
GOT ENGAGED -- WE WERE SHOCKED
'CAUSE SHE'S NICE.

24
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:06,900
THEY'VE DONE THE SHOPPING
FOR GIFTS

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,935
AND ALL THE FITTINGS
AND ALL THAT CRAP.

26
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,171
FINALLY, TONIGHT,
IT ALL PAYS OFF

27
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,840
IN THE BIG CELEBRATION
EVERY MAN LOOKS FORWARD TO.

28
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:16,709
NO, UNCLE RED, THE WEDDING'S

29
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:17,644
NOT TILL
TOMORROW.

30
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:20,213
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE STAG PARTY, HAROLD.

31
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:22,382
STAG PARTY'S TONIGHT, OK?

32
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:24,484
MOOSE THOMPSON'S ORGANIZING
THE FOOD FIGHT.

33
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,319
BUSTER HADFIELD'S DOING
THE DIRTY TRICKS.

34
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,054
OLD MAN SEDGWICK'S
MARKING THE CARDS.

35
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,623
HOW ARE YOU CONTRIBUTING?

36
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:32,492
I'M NOT GOING.

37
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,393
PERFECT!

38
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:39,699
(Horns honking)

39
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,303
(Geese honking)

40
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,805
(Quacking)

41
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,245
(Red): YOU'RE LOOKIN'
AT SEGMENTS

42
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,680
FROM THIS PARTICULAR SHOW,

43
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:57,417
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT CHANGING THE CHANNEL.

44
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:01,788
TO MAKE SENSE OUT OF THIS,
YOU GOTTA GIVE IT

45
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,189
YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.

46
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,600
(Laughing)

47
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:17,270
(Laughing)

48
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,974
WELL, JUST A FEW HOURS TO GO
TILL JUNIOR'S STAG PARTY.

49
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,442
I GOT ALL MY SUPPLIES HERE.

50
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:26,379
HAND BUZZER, PLASTER BANDAGES,
BALL AND CHAIN...

51
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,882
LAXATIVES THAT LOOK
LIKE CHOCOLATE...

52
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,750
(Laughing)

53
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:32,418
HOT GUM...

54
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:33,586
MOLASSES...

55
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,522
ANIMAL TRANQUILLIZER...

00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,423
INDELIBLE INK...

57
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,059
WHOOPEE CUSHION,
WHOOPEE PILLOW,

58
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,194
WHOOPEE MATTRESS -- WHOOPEE!

59
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,797
UNCLE RED, UNCLE RED!

60
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,167
I GOT GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS.

61
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,869
JUNIOR ASKED ME TO GO
TO THE STAG AND I SAID YES.

62
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:50,703
WHAT'S THE GOOD NEWS?

63
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,741
HE ASKED ME TO GET THE MOVIES.

64
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,010
HE SAID, "THE MOVIES."

65
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,012
I SAID, "O-KAY".

66
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,415
BUT I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

67
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:05,385
SURE YOU DO -- HE'S TALKING
ABOUT "THE MOVIES".

68
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,819
OHHHHH!

69
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:08,755
I DON'T KNOW.

70
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,790
I WENT TO ALL THE PLACES.

71
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,425
THE CONVENIENCE STORE, GAS BAR,

72
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:15,628
COFFEE SHOP, LAUNDROMAT...
THE GOOD MOVIES ARE GONE.

73
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:16,896
DID YOU TRY THE VIDEO STORE?

74
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:21,501
(Audience laughing)

75
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:23,670
OK.
YEAH.

76
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,777
WAHAHH, UNCLE RED!

77
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,179
HAVE I GOT SOME HOT MOVIES!

78
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,815
FORGET IT --
NONE OF THAT STUFF.

79
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,183
I HAVE TOO MUCH RESPECT
FOR WOMEN.

80
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:38,518
WE WON'T BE WATCHING
FILTHY MOVIES.

81
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,454
FILTHY MOVIES?! NO, NO, NO!

82
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:42,689
THESE ARE WAR MOVIES!

83
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:43,923
OH, RIGHT!

84
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,125
"THE DESERT FOX"...

85
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,694
"THE BIG RED ONE"...

86
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:48,695
"BUCK PRIVATES"...

87
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:49,862
WHO ARE YOU KIDDIN', HAROLD?

88
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,170
IF YOU LIKE UKULELE MUSIC,
CHANGE THE CHANNEL RIGHT NOW!

89
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:00,039
THIS IS A PREVIEW OF
THE "ADVENTURES WITH BILL".

90
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,241
KIND OF A HAWAIIAN THEME AND...

91
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,377
THOSE LEIS --
YOU CAN'T JUST HAVE ONE.

92
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:06,412
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

93
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,448
THAT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE
"WELCOME TO HAWAII".

94
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,817
IT'S LIKE "WELCOME
TO FIRE ISLAND".

95
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:13,052
OHHH! OH! OHHH!

96
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:15,255
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,

97
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,157
I'LL GET MY OWN LEIS,
THANK YOU.

98
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:19,792
THAT'S SOMETHING TO LIVE BY,
RIGHT THERE.

99
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,428
WHAT BILL WILL ALSO DO
ALL THROUGH THE SHOW,

100
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,598
HE'LL COOK A TURKEY
IN THE LUAU STYLE,

101
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,866
WHERE THEY DIG THE HOLE.

102
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:30,169
IT'S A TRADITIONAL,
RITUAL THING,

103
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,437
KIND OF A POLYNESIAN THING.

104
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,873
THIS IS PART OF THE DANCE.

105
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,642
THE HANDS TELL THE STORY.

106
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,143
YEAH... OHHH!

107
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,811
THE DIRT TELLS THE STORY.

108
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,313
OHHHH!

109
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,848
AND THE SHOVEL USUALLY
ENDS THE STORY.

110
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,652
UH... YEAH, ANYWAY,
WE LIKE TO DO

111
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,353
SOME OF THE TRADITIONAL
COOKING AT THE LODGE.

112
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:50,690
THIS IS THE HAWAIIAN,
THE POLYNESIAN, THE FIJI...

113
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,525
HAVE THEY "FIJI"d YOU YET?

114
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,294
NO, THEY HAVEN'T COOKED...
NEVER MIND.

115
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:58,298
BILL'S DIGGING WITH-- NO, BILL,
THAT'S A UKULELE.

116
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,932
YOU DON'T USE THAT.

117
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,468
I USE THAT --
YOU USE THE SHOVEL.

118
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:03,936
BILL'S VERY CREATIVE.

119
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,606
AWAY YOU GO --
OH, FOR GOSH SAKES.

120
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,308
OHHHHH

121
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,710
I KNOW A GUY
WITH A CAR NAMED SUE

122
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,845
HE WAS THE BUTT
OF MANY JOKES

123
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:16,349
HE HAD NAMED HIS CAR
AFTER HIS WIFE

124
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,718
'CAUSE IT'S HARD TO START
AND IT SMOKES

125
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:22,588
THIS IS THE BIG ONE!

126
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,223
FOR THE GRAND PRIZE OF KEYS

127
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:27,927
TO A BRAND-NEW BUNGALOW
WORTH OVER $200,000!

128
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,195
OH, BABY!

129
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:31,631
WHO DONATED
THAT, HAROLD?

130
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:32,832
THE GUY WHO BOUGHT
THE BUNGALOW.

131
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:36,169
HE GOT NEW LOCKS,
SO HE DIDN'T WANT THESE KEYS.

132
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,172
THAT'S A GOOD KEYCHAIN.

133
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,206
YOU CAN USE THE KEYCHAIN.

134
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,408
UNCLE RED,
YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS

135
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,577
TO GET DALTON HUMPHREY
TO SAY THIS WORD.

136
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,213
"DISCUSS."

137
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,083
"DISCUSS."

138
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,252
AND GO!

139
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:54,520
ALL RIGHT,
DALTON.

140
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,290
WHEN YOU AND YOUR WIFE
DISAGREE ABOUT SOMETHING,

141
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,791
YOU AND SHE...
... ARGUE.

142
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:02,161
NO, NO YELLING, NO YELLING.

143
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:04,197
NO, YOU SAID MY WIFE.

144
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,400
ALL RIGHT, OK,
COULD BE ANYBODY'S WIFE

145
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,435
OR GIRLFRIEND, OR BOTH --
RIGHT, HAROLD?

146
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,871
OR, IN YOUR CASE, NEITHER!

147
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:13,773
OK, UH...

148
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,842
ANOTHER WORD
FOR "TALK".
NAG.

149
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,510
DIALOGUE.

150
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,444
DIATRIBE.

151
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,446
SHARE IDEAS.

152
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:21,047
COMPLAIN.

153
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,649
ALMOST OUT OF TIME, UNCLE RED.

154
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:27,387
YOU WANT TO COMMUNICATE
IN A FRIENDLY WAY.

155
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,322
TO GIVE IN.

156
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,991
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

157
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:34,761
IF YOUR WIFE WANTS TO NAG,
ARGUE, OR COMPLAIN,

158
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:35,628
SHE'LL SAY, "HONEY,

159
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,263
"THERE'S SOMETHING
WE HAVE TO..."

160
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,765
... BUY.

161
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:42,402
(Audience laughing)

162
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,037
NO, AND BEFORE
YOU BUY ANYTHING,

163
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,139
FIRST,
YOU WOULD...

164
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,707
... KEEL OVER STONE-DEAD!

165
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,344
I'M NOT PUTTING ONE MORE DIME
INTO THAT LIVING ROOM!

166
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,347
PEOPLE EXPECT MOTH-HOLES
IN PLAID DRAPES.

167
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,515
THE CASE IS CLOSED.

168
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,350
I DON'T WANT TO DISCUSS IT!

169
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,719
HEY!
WHAT?

170
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:01,654
THAT WAS THE WORD.

171
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:02,755
DISCUSS!

172
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,023
(Applause)

173
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:05,591
(Grunting)

174
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,728
WHAT IS WITH
THESE CAR COMPANIES?

175
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,063
WHAT'S THE POINT
IN HAVING A GAS GAUGE

176
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,031
IF IT'S NOT ACCURATE?

177
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,767
WHEN IT SAYS "FULL",
IT IS FULL.

178
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,702
I GOT THE WET PANTS
TO PROVE IT.

179
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,137
WHEN IT SAYS "EMPTY",

180
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,273
YOU MIGHT HAVE ANOTHER
50 MILES IN THERE,

181
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,310
OR, AS IN THE CASE TODAY,
YOU MIGHT IN FACT BE EMPTY.

182
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:27,513
THIS WEEK ON "HANDYMAN CORNER",

183
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:28,614
I’M GONNA SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE A

184
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,049
COST-EFFECTIVE HOT TUB.

185
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:34,287
WHAT DOES A HOT TUB HAVE TO DO
WITH FUEL TANKS? SHHH!

186
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,292
I'M GONNA MAKE MY HOT TUB
OUT OF AN OLD FREEZER.

187
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:42,028
FREEZERS ARE MEANT
TO KEEP THINGS COLD.

188
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,730
SINCE THIS ONE DOESN'T
ANY MORE,

189
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,266
I FIGURE, WHY NOT USE IT
TO KEEP THINGS WARM?

190
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,902
LET'S START
AND FIND OUT WHY NOT.

191
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,005
(Grunting)

192
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,777
THIS WON'T MAKE A BIG HOT TUB,
BUT WITH ALL THE S.T.D.'s

193
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,346
AND G.S.T.'s AND I.O.U.'s
GOIN' AROUND,

194
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,815
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO GET BACK
TO THOSE INNOCENT TIMES

195
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,617
WHEN YOU JUST PLAYED
WITH YOURSELF IN THE BATHTUB.

196
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:10,256
SOME OF YOU ARE SAYING, "WHY
NOT USE THE BATHTUB ITSELF?"

197
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:13,392
FIRST, DON'T CONFUSE
ME STOPPING FOR BREATH

198
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,061
WITH A REQUEST FOR SUGGESTIONS.

199
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:16,929
AND SECONDLY,

200
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,934
WITH THE LID ON, YOU CAN KEEP
HEAT IN AND BIRD-TREATS OUT.

201
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:24,036
WE GOT A LITTLE LIGHT,

202
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,973
WHICH MAKES IT NICE FOR
THE ROMANTIC LATE-NIGHT DIPS,

203
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,308
AND MAYBE CAN HELP YOU
FIND YOUR TOUPEE.

204
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,912
TO TURN THIS INTO A HOT TUB,

205
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,181
YOU NEED A PUMP
WITH SOME HOSES ON 'ER.

206
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,117
I KNOW, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO ADD WATER.

207
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,619
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
PUT BLEACH IN

208
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:40,753
TO PURIFY THE WATER.

209
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,889
YOU NEED TO ADD AIR TO IT.

210
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,591
THAT'S IF YOU'RE BUILDING
A REAL HOT TUB... I'M NOT.

211
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:49,228
THIS HERE IS A FAKE,
JUST A DECOY.

212
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,266
I'M JUST SOLVING
THE GAS-GAUGE PROBLEM

213
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,166
WITH THE POSSUM VAN.

214
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,937
WE WANT IT TO LOOK
LIKE A HOT TUB

215
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:01,007
SO THAT VISITORS WILL PARK
NEARBY WITHOUT WORRYING.

216
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,477
WHAT IT REALLY IS
IS OUR PERSONAL GAS STATION.

217
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,779
WHAT WE DO,
WHEN NOBODY'S LOOKING,

218
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:10,917
TAKE ONE END OF THE HOSE,
STICK THAT INTO THEIR GAS TANK.

219
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,887
YOU GRAB YOUR REVERSIBLE
PUMP CONTROL, PRESS "SUCK",

220
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,356
AND IT PUTS ALL THEIR GAS--

221
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:18,958
WELL, NOT ALL THEIR GAS.

222
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:19,592
YOU WANT TO LEAVE SOME

223
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,260
SO THEY CAN GET
A FEW MILES DOWN THE ROAD.

224
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,728
THEY WON'T SUSPECT ANYTHING.

225
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,731
YOU MIGHT WANT TO
CLOSE THE LID.

226
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,733
YOU DON'T WANT GAS FUMES
TO GIVE YOU AWAY.

227
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,935
WE'VE BEEN THERE, HAVEN'T WE?

228
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,970
WE'LL JUST CUT THAT OFF.

229
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,640
THEN YOU BRING
YOUR OWN VEHICLE NEARBY...

230
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,544
AND PUT THE END OF THE HOSE
INTO YOUR VEHICLE

231
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,313
AND THEN YOU PRESS THE PUMP
TO "BLOW"

232
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:43,783
AND YOU ACTUALLY FILL UP
YOUR OWN TANK WITH THEIR GAS.

233
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:44,917
ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL?

234
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:48,387
BY GOLLY! NO ONE'S
ANY THE WISER.

235
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,489
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

236
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,124
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

237
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:55,728
ONE MORE FILL-UP AND
I GET A SET OF DINNERWARE.

238
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:59,098
(Electricity sparking)

239
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,204
BY GOLLY, I'M WRONG.

240
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:06,472
THIS IS A HOT TUB.

241
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,243
STAY TUNED -- WHATEVER THIS IS,
WE GOT LOTS MORE OF IT.

242
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,782
SOME OF YOU TEENAGERS
ARE WORKIN' HARD AT SCHOOL,

243
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,719
SWEATING OUT SOME SLAVE-LABOUR
JOB ON WEEKENDS,

244
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:23,856
ONLY TO HAVE YOUR PARENTS SAY,
"CLEAN UP YOUR ROOM!

245
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:25,891
"NO, YOU CAN'T HAVE
A MOTORCYCLE.

246
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,594
"THE POLICE WANT TO TALK
TO YOU -- HIDE THAT STEREO."

247
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,665
YOU'RE THINKING,
"WHEN DOES THE FUN START?

248
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:36,102
"WHEN DOES LIFE TURN INTO
A BEER COMMERCIAL?"

249
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,770
WHERE EVERYBODY'S LAUGHING
AND EATING

250
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,538
AND NOT WORKING
AND NOT GETTING FAT.

251
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:43,476
YOU'RE THINKING YOU'RE
THE ONLY PERSON NOT HAVING FUN.

252
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,445
THE TRUTH IS,
FOR THE MOST PART,

253
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:49,582
EVERYBODY'S FAKING IT...
EVEN IN THE BEER COMMERCIAL.

254
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,951
THE LAUGHING AND EATING
IS JUST THOSE PEOPLE WORKING.

255
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,953
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.

256
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,555
IN MY LIFE, I'VE ONLY FOUND
THREE THINGS

257
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:57,623
THAT WERE PURE FUN.

258
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,426
FISHING, BELONGING
TO POSSUM LODGE,

259
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,995
AND PANTS
WITH AN ELASTIC WAISTBAND.

260
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:12,038
WELL, BY GOLLY,
THAT WAS SOME STAG LAST NIGHT!

261
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:14,407
AND THE WOMEN
MISSED THE WHOLE THING.

262
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,942
THEY WERE AT SOME STUPID SHOWER
FOR THE BRIDE.

263
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,978
IT WAS A LECTURE ON COOKING.

264
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,113
THEY HAD SOME GUY
NAMED MR. SUPER-BUNS.

265
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:23,315
(Laughing)

266
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:24,650
UNBELIEVABLE.

267
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,285
BERNICE SAID IT WAS
A REAL EYE-OPENER.

268
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,655
BUT, BY GOLLY,
WE HAD OURSELVES--

269
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:31,424
HAROLD, I DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.

270
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,827
I LEFT WHEN
THE PRACTICAL JOKES STARTED.

271
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,829
I CAN ONLY TAKE
SO MANY WEDGIES.

272
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,965
BETTER TO GIVE THAN RECEIVE.

273
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,334
YOU KNOW,
ORIGINALLY,

274
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,136
WE WERE GONNA PLAY TRICKS
ON JUNIOR,

275
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,938
'CAUSE HE WAS THE GROOM.

276
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:49,341
THEN SOME SMART-ALEC YELLED,
"GET THE HEAD USHER!"

277
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,777
THAT WAS YOU --
YOU YELLED THAT.

278
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,913
(Laughing)

279
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:56,015
I HAD THE MOLASSES
AND THE FEATHERS.

280
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,017
WASTE NOT, WANT NOT.

281
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:01,053
WE DID THE USHERS
AND FATHER OF THE BRIDE.

282
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,823
THEN WE STARTED WORKING OUR WAY
THROUGH THE CROWD.

283
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,825
A PARTY LIKE THAT

284
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,626
MAKES YOU SEE IT'S WORTHWHILE
GETTING MARRIED.

285
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:10,930
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO

286
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:11,931
IF THE GROOM ISN'T THERE?

287
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,134
WE TAPED IT
TO STINKY'S PANT-LEG.

288
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:19,438
NOT THE BROOM, THE GROOM --
JUNIOR'S STILL MISSING.

289
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:20,673
NO, WE STRIPPED HIM.

290
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:21,974
WE CHAINED HIM TO THE DOCK.

291
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,410
I HEARD HE WAS GETTING
SOME DECENT NIBBLES.

292
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,246
NO, THAT
WASN'T JUNIOR.

293
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,080
YOU DID THAT

294
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,948
TO FLINTY McCLINTOCK.

295
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:32,384
NO, HAROLD, FLINTY,
WE PUT INTO A BODY CAST.

296
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,820
WE PUT HIM ON
A ONE-WAY TRAIN TO...

297
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:36,889
THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN JUNIOR.

298
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,659
WAY TO GO, UNCLE RED,
WAY TO GO!

299
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,928
WEDDING'S IN LESS THAN
TWO HOURS AND THERE'S NO GROOM.

300
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:43,929
WAY TO GO!

301
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,099
SHE'LL HAVE TO MARRY FLINTY.

302
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,835
FLINTY'S WIFE WILL BE HAPPY
TO LET SOMEBODY ELSE TAKE OVER.

303
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:51,570
YEAH, I SUPPOSE.

304
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,007
(Red): MEANWHILE, BACK WITH

305
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,042
DON HO'S EVIL TWIN BROTHER,
GUNG HO...

306
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,544
OHHHH!

307
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,812
GOLLY, THERE'S THE TURKEY...

308
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,647
AND IT'S A BOY!

309
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,482
BY GOLLY... ALL RIGHT.

310
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:04,650
WE'VE DUG THE HOLE.

311
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,551
WE HAD A FIRE GOING.

312
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,820
OK, OK, BILL, BILL!

313
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,356
ALL RIGHT, WE GOT

314
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,323
THE ROCKS ALL HEATED.

315
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:14,860
WOW, THAT'S HOT, THAT'S HOT.

316
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,495
YOU GET THE ROCKS,
THE HOT ROCKS,

317
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,397
AND YOU PUT THEM
INTO THE TURKEY.

318
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:19,565
FIRE ONE IN, BILL.

319
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,667
HERE WE GO... OH, BOY, AND...

320
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,136
THERE WE ARE -- BY GOLLY.

321
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:27,106
IF YOU DON'T THINK THAT'S
PAINFUL, YOU ASK A TURKEY.

322
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,708
YOU DROP 'ER INTO THE HOLE
AND PUT THE HOT ROCKS

323
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:30,876
ALL AROUND THE TURKEY.

324
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,412
FIRE 'EM IN, FIRE 'EM IN.

325
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,848
GET 'EM IN THERE!

326
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,018
YOU COVER THAT UNIT WITH DIRT.

327
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,887
YOU WANT TO SEAL THAT IN,
LIKE A PRESSURE COOKER,

328
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,623
IN THE HAWAIIAN, POLYNESIAN,
FIJI STYLE OF LIFE.

329
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,726
OH, BILL'S GOT
THE UKULELE TO HELP.

330
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,962
OK, THAT'S GOOD --
WE COVER UP WITH DIRT.

331
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:53,199
YOU WANT IT COMPLETELY COVERED
WITH THE DIRT OF THE AREA.

332
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,935
HE'S BRINGING IN
THE VARIOUS LEAVES.

333
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,537
THIS GIVES IT
KIND OF THE FLAVOURING.

334
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,372
IT CHANGES THE TASTE,
APPARENTLY.

335
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,374
WHAT HAVE WE GOT NEXT, BILL?

336
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,911
OH... AH! CAR MATS
OUT OF A K-CAR.

337
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,480
AND NOW, WE'LL BE BACK
WHEN DINNER'S READY.

338
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,349
AWAY YOU GO -- OH, MAN!

339
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,557
SO I'VE DEVISED
A 12-STEP PROGRAMME

340
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:21,527
TO HELP YOU OVERCOME
THIS BIOLOGICAL IMPERATIVE.

341
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,296
NO MORE EXCUSES,
NO MORE SAYING...

342
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:25,965
(Imitating Red):
"SORRY, IT'S A GUY THING."

343
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:29,368
I'LL THROW OPEN THE FLOOR
TO MY UNCLE RED

344
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,236
TO START THE MEETING.

345
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,504
MAN!

346
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,108
ALL RIGHT, I'M RED
AND I'M A MAN.

347
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,643
(All): HI, RED.

348
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:40,546
ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO
THE "MEN ANONYMOUS" PLEDGE.

349
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,948
I'M A MALE...

350
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,283
BUT I CAN CHANGE...

351
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,185
IF I HAVE TO...

352
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:47,686
I GUESS.

353
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,121
THANKS.

354
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,624
(Laughing and applause)

355
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,128
LET'S GET STARTED
BY SHARING OUR EMOTIONS.

356
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:58,430
WHO WOULD LIKE TO START
BY SHARING EMOTIONS?

357
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,136
WOULD SOMEONE LIKE
TO STATE THEIR OPINION?

358
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:05,971
OH, I THOUGHT SO.

359
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,640
OK, HOW ABOUT... DOUGIE?

360
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,842
OHHHH!
THANK YOU.

361
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,515
GENTLEMEN, MY NAME IS DOUGIE.

362
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,017
I'M A MAN.

363
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,718
(All): HI, DOUGIE.

364
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,821
GENTLEMEN, LAST WEEK
WAS A DIFFICULT ONE FOR ME.

365
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:27,426
I WAS TEMPTED
TO FALL OFF THE WAGON

366
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,628
AND GO RIGHT BACK
INTO SOME OLD BAD HABITS.

367
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:34,366
THE TEMPTATION OCCURRED RIGHT
IN FRONT OF THE HARDWARE STORE.

368
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:36,568
THERE WAS A FELLA THERE

369
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:39,104
CHANGING A FLAT TIRE
ON HIS PICKUP TRUCK AND...

370
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,075
HE WAS DOIN' IT WRONG!

371
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:49,648
HE DIDN'T PUT HIS WHEEL NUTS
IN THE HUBCAP!

372
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,517
(Red): OH, FOR
GOSH SAKES!

373
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:54,420
I BIT MY TONGUE,
AND THEN IT OCCURRED TO ME.

374
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:58,524
UNE PIECE DE RESISTANCE
AU DOUGIE.

375
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,260
I GOT MY TRUCK.

376
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,830
I PARKED BESIDE HIM
WHERE HE WAS CHANGING HIS TIRE

377
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,099
AND I STARTED CHANGING
ONE OF MY TIRES,

378
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,134
EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T FLAT.

379
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,305
I CHANGED THAT SUCKER
THE RIGHT WAY

380
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,775
SO THAT SORRY EXCUSE FOR A MAN
WOULD LEARN!

381
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,243
WAY TO GO,
DOUGIE!

382
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:19,945
THAT'S THE WAY
TO DO IT!

383
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,613
THAT'S
THE STUFF!

384
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,617
(Red): DINNER HAD TAKEN
QUITE A WHILE.

385
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:28,654
I DOZED OFF IN THE SUN,
BUT, LUCKILY,

386
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,289
I HAD LEFT A WAKE-UP CALL.

387
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:35,160
THERE WE GO, AND NOW
WE'RE SET TO CHECK OUT--

388
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,595
DIG UP OUR TURKEY.

389
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,097
SHOULD BE COOKED TO PERFECTION.

390
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,698
BILL'S DIGGING WITH...

391
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:42,701
SOMETHING I HADN'T NOTICED,
AND MAYBE WE GOT LUCKY.

392
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,371
WE DON'T GET LUCKY OFTEN.

393
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,806
YOU'RE NOT WORRIED -- HE THINKS
WE'LL GET LUCKY TWICE

394
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:48,774
AND THAT NEVER HAPPENS.

395
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,010
YOU ALL RIGHT, BILL?

396
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:55,214
YOU MAY HAVE HIT A BURIED--
YOU HIT A WIRE, BILL.

397
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,717
WE'LL BE BACK
WHEN THIS ROCK CONCERT'S OVER.

398
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,285
OH, BOY.

399
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:03,122
HERE'S A GIFT FROM OUR FRIENDS
AT THE OUTBACK PUB IN OTTAWA.

400
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,757
IT'S A BRIEFCASE.

401
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:11,697
BACK AT THE "OH, WOW" LUAU,
WE'RE DIGGING UP THE TURKEY.

402
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,333
YOU GOT THE TURKEY? IS IT DONE?

403
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,436
VEGETABLES?!
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

404
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,206
WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT IS A FARMER'S FIELD.

405
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,776
MAYBE... HE MUST HAVE
PLANTED SOMETHING.

406
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,477
THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF THE LUAU.

407
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,348
THIS WILL HELP ME SEE AT NIGHT,

408
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,150
WHICH IS WHEN WE'LL FIND
THE DARN THING.

409
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,551
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

410
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,254
OH, MY GOSH! OH, MY GOSH!

411
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,989
THAT'S A TREASURE--
THERE'S A--

412
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,558
THAT'S GOT--
THERE'S VALUE THERE!

413
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,459
THERE'S CAPTAIN HOOK!

414
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,227
WHAT?

415
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,063
OH, THE HOOKS.

416
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,131
OH, MAN!

417
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:48,133
STILL NO TURKEY, HUH?

418
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,501
CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

419
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,970
OH, YEAH, THERE'S ONE.

420
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:56,108
FLINTY DECLINED
THE OPPORTUNITY

421
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,543
TO MARRY JUNIOR'S FIANCEE.

422
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:00,846
I SUGGEST THAT JUNIOR SHOW UP
FOR THIS WEDDING SOON.

423
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,582
I GOT A FAX OVER MY FAX-MODEM.

424
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,118
JUNIOR'S ON HIS WAY --
HE'S UP NEAR KENORA.

425
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,655
WHY DIDN'T HE FAX HIMSELF
RATHER THAN THE NOTE?

426
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,356
(Laughing)

427
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:15,160
FAX A PERSON
OVER A FAX MACHINE -- WHOO!

428
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,595
(Laughing)

429
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:20,165
YOU JUST DON'T GET
THIS MODERN TECHNOLOGY.

430
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,468
THE DUMBEST THING
I'VE EVER HEARD!

431
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,036
WHOO! FAX A PERSON!

432
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:24,870
HELLO!

433
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:27,406
DUMB, EH, HAROLD?

434
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,942
'CAUSE THEY DO IT
ON "STAR TREK".

435
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:33,912
(Audience laughing)

436
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:37,416
NEVER THOUGHT I'D HEAR HAROLD
SAY "STAR TREK" IS DUMB.

437
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:41,620
NO, NO! I DIDN'T!

438
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,122
CAPTAIN PICARD, YOU HEARD ME
NOT SAY THAT, RIGHT?

439
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,090
HELLO, KLINGONS!

440
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:45,824
OH, MAN!

441
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,193
(Audience laughing)

442
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,361
PUT THAT AWAY!

443
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,196
WE GOTTA GET
TO THE CHURCH.

444
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,431
THE WEDDING'S
IN HALF AN HOUR.

445
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:55,400
BUT JUNIOR'S, LIKE,
FIVE HOURS AWAY.

446
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,269
DON'T GET YOUR JOCKEYS
INTO A JAM.

447
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,373
GETTING THE GROOM TO CHURCH
IS THE BEST MAN'S JOB.

448
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,809
YOU'RE
THE BEST MAN.

449
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,576
OH, MAN, YEAH.

450
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,279
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

451
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,147
WHY? WHAT?

452
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,516
NOBODY SAYS THE GROOM
HAS TO BE JUNIOR.

453
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,384
OH, NO!!

454
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:13,619
HAROLD, IT'S JUST

455
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,420
A PROXY THING, THAT'S ALL.

456
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,090
YOU JUST SAY THE VOWS
ON JUNIOR'S BEHALF.

457
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,726
JUST PROXY --
IT'S JUST WORDS.

458
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:21,593
JUST WORDS.

459
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,629
YOU TAKE HIS PLACE
FOR THE WEDDING.

460
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:27,099
LET'S HOPE HE SHOWS UP
BEFORE THE HONEYMOON.

461
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,600
OH, NO!!

462
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,169
COME ON!

463
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,606
COME ON.

464
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,309
WE ALL BEEN THERE ON THIS ONE.

465
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,978
YOU'RE ABOUT TO WALK IN
THE HOUSE

466
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:41,480
AND THEN IT HITS YOU.

467
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,083
"WASN'T I SUPPOSED TO
DO SOMETHING ON THE WAY HOME?"

468
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,119
YOU CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS.

469
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,454
CAN'T TELL HER --
YOU KNOW HOW SHE GETS.

470
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:52,057
YOU GOTTA JOG YOUR MEMORY.

471
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:53,892
SLIP IN
THE HOUSE...

472
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:55,861
COUNT
THE KIDS.

473
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:59,031
IF YOU'RE SHORT ONE OR TWO,

474
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,799
MAYBE YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO
PICK THEM UP.

475
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,802
COUNT THE CARS IN THE DRIVEWAY.

476
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:05,971
IF ONE'S MISSING, MAYBE YOU
WERE SUPPOSED TO PICK 'ER UP

477
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:09,641
AT A SERVICE STATION
OR ON THE HIGHWAY.

478
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:12,678
IF THERE'S TOO MANY CARS,
YOU HAVE COMPANY.

479
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,780
MAYBE YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO
PICK UP GROCERIES.

480
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,882
CHECK FOR A LIST
SHE MIGHT HAVE SLIPPED YOU.

481
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,085
IF YOU COME UP EMPTY,
WALK INTO THE HOUSE,

482
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,254
SAY, "HONEY, I'M HOME",
GIVE HER THE BIG HUG.

483
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,324
WHILE HER BACK'S TURNED
TO THE CALENDAR,

484
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:28,594
SEE IF THERE'S A BIRTHDAY
OR ANNIVERSARY WRITTEN IN.

485
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,295
IF YOU DON'T SEE ANYTHING,

486
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,731
MAYBE YOU FORGOT
TO GET BREAD OR MILK.

487
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:36,168
SHE'LL CALL YOU "STUPID"
AND LAUGH AT YOU.

488
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,837
CONSIDER YOURSELF LUCKY --
YOU GOT OFF EASY...

489
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:40,739
... THIS TIME!

490
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,711
(Red): THIS IS IT --
WE'RE GETTING CLOSE,

491
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,246
'CAUSE BILL FOUND A ROCK.

492
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,648
GET RID OF THE ROCK.

493
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:52,117
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT WAY.

494
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,152
HE'S GOT THE TURKEY, THOUGH.

495
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,154
BY GOSH, CAN YOU SMELL THAT?

496
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:57,189
ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL!

497
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,757
WOW! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

498
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:03,528
OH, BILL'S AUDITIONING
FOR HIS PUPPET SHOW FOR KIDS.

499
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:07,199
OH, MAN! GET AWAY FROM ME.

500
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,201
ALL RIGHT, LOOK AT THAT --
LOOK AT THE TABLE SETTING.

501
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:12,371
THE PRESENTATION IS...
ALMOST NOTHING.

502
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,605
WE NEED DRINKS, BILL.

503
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,340
CAN YOU HANDLE THAT?

504
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,842
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

505
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,610
OH, A WATER PIPE.

506
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,413
CHEERS!

507
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:24,049
OH, MAN! FRIGHTENING, ISN'T IT?

508
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,751
(Audience laughing)

509
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:30,889
JUNIOR DID MAKE IT
TO THE CHURCH ON TIME

510
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,391
'CAUSE THE CEREMONY WAS LATE.

511
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,594
THE GUYS WERE HURTIN'
FROM THE STAG PARTY.

512
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,129
TOOK 'EM FOREVER
TO GET INTO THE PEWS.

513
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:41,033
IT WAS NICE, HAVING OLD MAN
SEDGWICK AS THE RING-BOY.

514
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:44,903
HE'S GOT RINGS -- HE'S LIKE A
TREE, WITHOUT THE INTELLIGENCE.

515
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,306
TOOK JUNIOR A LONG TIME

516
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,774
TO GET THE RING
ON THE BRIDE'S FINGER

517
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:51,143
'CAUSE HE WAS COVERED
IN MOLASSES AND FEATHERS.

518
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,112
I THOUGHT YOU'D HAVE
WASHED HIM A BIT.

519
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:56,114
WE THOUGHT OF HOSING HIM DOWN

520
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:57,683
BUT THEN HE'D GET MARRIED
IN HIS UNDERWEAR.

521
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,353
THE BRIDE THOUGHT
SHE WAS MARRYING

522
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:02,521
BIG BIRD.

523
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,123
SHE WON'T SAY THAT
AFTER THE HONEYMOON.

524
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,427
(Possum squeal)

525
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,295
MEETING TIME,
UNCLE RED.

526
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:11,630
YOU GO AHEAD, HAROLD.

527
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,266
REMIND THE GUYS, WE GOT
A BRIDAL SUITE TO SABOTAGE.

528
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,067
OK!

529
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,903
I TAKE MY RESPONSIBILITIES
SERIOUSLY.

530
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:19,771
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

531
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:21,273
I'M COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

532
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:24,743
WITH THE WEDDING AND ROMANCE
AND YOUNG LOVE AND EVERYTHING,

533
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,212
I WAS HOPING MAYBE LATER,
WE COULD HAVE SOME FUN.

534
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,950
THE REST OF YOU,
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF

535
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,318
AND HAROLD AND THE GANG,

536
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:36,888
THANKS FOR WATCHING
AND KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

537
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:40,625
(Applause)

538
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:44,029
(Possum squeal)

539
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:52,671
(Harold): HE'S HERE, HE'S HERE!

540
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:00,746
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

541
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,514
(Red): SIT DOWN... HAROLD?

542
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,683
(Harold): SOMEONE RAN OVER

543
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:05,517
MY FAVOURITE HAT

544
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:09,187
ON THE HIGHWAY.
WOULD YOU PLEASE WAIT

545
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:10,722
UNTIL I'M OUT OF IT NEXT TIME?

546
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,124
(Laughing)

547
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:17,295
MUST HAVE BEEN STINKY'S CAR --
THERE'S NO TREAD-MARKS.
