1
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:05,338
(Tires screeching)

2
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:08,174
(Motor revving)

3
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:11,044
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

4
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:14,013
HERE HE IS, A SELF-EDUCATED MAN

5
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:16,816
WHO'S A LIVING TESTIMONIAL TO
WHY YOU SHOULD STAY IN SCHOOL,

6
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:19,552
MY UNCLE, YOUR HERO, RED GREEN!

7
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:20,820
(Laughing)

8
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:22,455
(Applause)

9
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,457
(Cheering)

10
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,226
(Whistling)

11
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:27,927
HOW YOU DOING, HAROLD?

12
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,163
THANK YOU.

13
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,532
I WAS WALKING AROUND DOWNTOWN.

14
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:35,502
RALPHIE'S GAS STATION IS GONE. OKAY?

15
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:36,236
IT'S BEEN REPLACED

16
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:37,604
BY A CONVENIENCE STORE/

17
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,906
BANKING MACHINE/VIDEO OUTLET.

18
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,608
RALPHIE COULDN'T MAKE MONEY

19
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:42,442
IN THE GASOLINE BUSINESS.

20
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:44,811
WOW, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE,
UNCLE RED.

21
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,013
EVERYTHING AROUND HERE
RUNS ON GAS,

22
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,816
INCLUDING MOST
OF THE LODGE MEMBERS.

23
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:53,820
BOY, HE SOLD HUNDREDS OF
GALLONS TO YOU GUYS EVERY WEEK.

24
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:57,156
TO BE HONEST, A LOT OF GUYS
WERE TAKING GAS

25
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,093
FROM THE SELF-SERVE
AND NOT PAYING FOR IT.

26
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,928
RALPHIE'S PUMPS
AREN'T SELF-SERVE.

27
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:02,762
THEY ARE

28
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:05,131
AT 3:00
IN THE MORNING.

29
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:10,603
(Horns honking)

30
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,506
(Geese honking)

31
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,010
(Quacking)

32
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,916
(Red): RANGER GORD IS WOUND UP
JUST A LITTLE TOO TIGHT,

33
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:27,587
I'LL GRIND A BIG HOLE
IN THE POSSUM VAN,

34
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,056
GARTH HARBLE'S GOT SOMETHING
IN THE ATTIC,

35
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:31,924
BUT IT'S NOT WORTH MUCH,

36
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:35,862
AND WINSTON ROTHSCHILD
GOES ON AND ON AND ON...

37
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,371
WATCH YOUR ALLERGIES, HAROLD.

38
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:47,006
I MIGHT HAVE SPILLED GASOLINE
ON MYSELF.

39
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:49,208
DON'T COME NEAR ME!

40
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:51,177
OR THE STOVE.

41
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:53,880
I'M PARTICULARLY ALLERGIC
TO HUMAN TORCHES.

42
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,417
YOU TRY SOMETHING,
WHERE DOES IT GET YOU?

43
00:01:57,483 --> 00:01:59,318
WE WANTED TO RUN A PIPELINE

44
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:01,654
FROM THE GAS STATION
IN PORT ASBESTOS TO THE LODGE.

45
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:03,256
IT'S DOWNHILL ALL THE WAY.

46
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:04,724
THE GOVERNMENT STEPS IN.

47
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,061
SAYS IT'S ILLEGAL TO RUN
GASOLINE THROUGH EAVESTROUGHS.

48
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,531
I'M NOT SURE HOW LONG THE DUCT
TAPE WOULD HAVE HELD, ANYWAY.

49
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:13,466
WELL, MAYBE
I'M GLAD

50
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,700
WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT.

51
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,202
(Audience laughing)

52
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:19,338
I KNOW I'M GLAD
WE HAVE A FIRE DEPARTMENT.

53
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:23,409
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU HEARD,
BUT THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

54
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,912
THOSE BATHTUBS
WERE PORCELAIN.

55
00:02:26,078 --> 00:02:27,947
THERE WASN'T A LEAKY ONE
IN THE BUNCH.

56
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:31,417
WHOA! WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

57
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:35,154
OH, WELL, WE HAD A BUNCH
OF BATHTUBS ON A FLAT-BED

58
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:39,225
UP TO PORT ASBESTOS AND
WE FILLED THEM WITH GAS AND...

59
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,394
IT DIDN'T GO REAL WELL.

60
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,164
PERHAPS THEY WERE
A LITTLE *TOO* FULL?

61
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:48,167
NOT AFTER THE FIRST CORNER.

62
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:50,203
THE REAL PROBLEM HIT

63
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:53,172
WHEN JUNIOR SINGLETON
FLICKED HIS FLAMING BUTT

64
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,674
OUT THE WINDOW...

65
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,677
AND THEN HIS LIT CIGARETTE OUT.

66
00:02:57,743 --> 00:03:00,680
NO, NO, NO, I GOT THOSE
IN THE WRONG ORDER.

67
00:03:00,746 --> 00:03:04,584
(Applause)

68
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,320
(Red): BILL'S SOLUTION
TO BEING OUT OF GAS

69
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:09,989
IS TO FIND ANOTHER MODE
OF TRANSPORTATION.

70
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:13,092
HE'S GOING BACK TO
THE OLD WEST, THE OLD COWBOY.

71
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,460
THAT'S A REAL

72
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,597
LOVELY HORSE, BILL,
BUT HE'S NOT A QUALITY--

73
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:19,699
HE'S GOT A CHAW OF TOBACCO--

74
00:03:19,765 --> 00:03:21,701
OH, HE'S GONNA DO
THE SPITTOON THING.

75
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:23,035
OH, BY GOLLY.

76
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,704
THIS IS-- YOU KNOW, BILL--

77
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,138
OH, CAREFUL, THERE.

78
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,207
OH, YOU'RE FINE.

79
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,709
(Laughing)

80
00:03:29,775 --> 00:03:31,711
SPRING CAME EARLY THIS YEAR.

81
00:03:31,777 --> 00:03:34,447
AND HE'S GONNA FIRE THAT
INTO THE PAIL.

82
00:03:34,513 --> 00:03:36,248
OK, BILL, GET A BIG CHAW.

83
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:37,783
GET A MAN-SIZED--

84
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,385
OH.

85
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,721
OH, BY GOLLY.

86
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:42,988
UH, BILL?

87
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:44,924
NO, NO, YOU MISSED ON THAT.

88
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,492
YOU'LL FIND IT OVER...

89
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,160
IT'S OVER IN THAT AREA.

90
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:49,495
IT'S FUNNY, EH?

91
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,197
HE'LL BE BACK LATER.

92
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:56,736
SHE SCRIMPED AND SAVED
FOR TWO YEARS TO BUY THAT CAR.

93
00:03:56,802 --> 00:03:59,705
SHE DID NOT GIVE YOU PERMISSION
TO DRIVE IT,

94
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:03,676
BUT YOU HAD TO GO BEHIND HER
BACK AND TAKE IT FOR A DRIVE.

95
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,145
YOU HAD TO GO
TO THE LUMBER YARD

96
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:09,248
AND YOU HAD TO BUY
TWO SHEETS OF DRYWALL

97
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:13,185
AND YOU HAD TO CRAM THEM
INTO THAT TINY HATCHBAC.

98
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:16,422
AND YOU HAD TO RIP
THE UPHOLSTERY IN THE ROOF.

99
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,691
NOW WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA TELL HER?

100
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:22,695
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL HER
ANYTHING, NOT YET.

101
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:25,231
FIRST, YOU'RE GONNA DITCH
THAT DRYWALL.

102
00:04:25,297 --> 00:04:28,701
YOU GET BACK IN THAT CAR,
DRIVE OVER TO HER NEPHEWS'.

103
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:30,336
YOU KNOW THE ONES.

104
00:04:30,402 --> 00:04:33,706
THOSE ROTTEN LITTLE CHILDREN
OF SATAN.

105
00:04:33,772 --> 00:04:37,109
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE THEM OUT
AND BUY THEM ICE CREAM

106
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:38,711
AND CHOCOLATE AND POP.

107
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:40,346
ESPECIALLY CHOCOLATE.

108
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:43,148
AND MAKE SURE THEY SPEND
AT LEAST AN HOUR

109
00:04:43,215 --> 00:04:44,650
INSIDE THE CAR.

110
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,852
WHEN THOSE THREE HYENAS
ARE DONE,

111
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:50,656
YOUR RIP IN THE ROOF'S GONNA
LOOK LIKE AN AFTERTHOUGHT.

112
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:52,157
YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK.

113
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:53,659
HOW CAN SHE BLAME YOU?

114
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,161
YOU WERE TRYING TO BE NICE
TO
 HER
 NEPHEWS.

115
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:57,496
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT

116
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,999
THEY'RE ROTTEN,
DESTRUCTIVE SOCIOPATHS.

117
00:05:00,065 --> 00:05:01,333
THEY'RE FAMILY.

118
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,002
RIGHT!

119
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:05,337
(Applause)

120
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:06,404
(Strums acoustic guitar)

121
00:05:06,404 --> 00:05:10,175
LYING ON THE BOATHOUSE,
STARIN' AT THE STARS

122
00:05:10,242 --> 00:05:12,678
NO NOISE, NO HORN,
NO EXHAUST

123
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:15,347
AT LEAST, NONE OF IT
FROM CARS, RIGHT?

124
00:05:15,414 --> 00:05:17,683
I DON'T LET ANYONE
UP HERE

125
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,685
IT'S MY OWN
PRIVATE LITTLE NEST

126
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,687
BUT NOW THAT
I'VE THROWN MY BACK OUT

127
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:23,022
AND I'M PRETTY MUCH
PARALYSED

128
00:05:23,088 --> 00:05:24,356
FROM THE EYEBROWS DOWN

129
00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:28,027
I'M VALUING PRIVACY
LESS AND LESS

130
00:05:28,093 --> 00:05:29,762
OH!

131
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:33,132
DON'T BELIEVE WHAT YOU READ
IN THE NEWSPAPERS.

132
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:35,634
THE REASON WE HAVE
A FUEL SHORTAGE IS

133
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:38,404
BECAUSE OUR GAS TANKS
AREN'T BIG ENOUGH.

134
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,606
THIS WEEK IN "HANDYMAN CORNER",

135
00:05:40,672 --> 00:05:44,376
I'M GONNA PUT A MAN-SIZE
GAS TANK INTO THE POSSUM VAN.

136
00:05:46,712 --> 00:05:49,915
ORIGINALLY, I WAS THINKING
I'D POP IN THIS UNIT,

137
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,584
BUT I DON'T THINK
THIS WILL DO THE JOB.

138
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:55,120
IT WON'T HOLD ENOUGH GAS
TO COVER OFF

139
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:58,157
THE GAS MILEAGE PROBLEM
I HAVE WITH THE VAN.

140
00:05:58,223 --> 00:06:00,659
I COULD CHANGE THE PLUGS
AND POINTS,

141
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:03,028
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO GET INTO THAT.

142
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:04,696
INSTEAD, WHAT I NEED IS

143
00:06:04,763 --> 00:06:07,666
A GAS TANK THE SAME SIZE
AS THE WHOLE VAN.

144
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:10,402
ONCE I FILL THIS UNIT UP
WITH GASOLINE,

145
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:13,839
I NEED SOME WAY TO GET GAS
INTO THE REAL GAS TANK

146
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,674
TO GO UP INTO THE ENGINE.

147
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:18,210
NO PROBLEM --
HACK A HOLE IN THE FLOOR

148
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:20,245
AND LET GRAVITY DO THE WORK.

149
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:27,119
NOW, BEFORE WE START THROWING

150
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:30,088
A COUPLE OF THOUSAND GALLONS
INTO THIS UNIT,

151
00:06:30,155 --> 00:06:34,026
YOU WANT TO PLUG UP ANYWHERE
THAT GASOLINE MIGHT SEEP OUT.

152
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:35,961
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE DRIVING

153
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,263
WITH THE GAS
ROARING OUT OF HER...

154
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,798
NOT AT TODAY'S PRICES.

155
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:41,500
I'VE GONE DOWN THE DASHBOARD,

156
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,436
COVERED UP WHEREVER I THOUGHT
GASOLINE MIGHT LEAK --

157
00:06:44,503 --> 00:06:47,105
THE HEADLIGHTS SWITCH,
THE WINDSHIELD WASHERS.

158
00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:49,141
I'VE GOT THE HEATER VENT
CLOSED UP.

159
00:06:49,207 --> 00:06:52,244
DO EXTRA DUCT TAPE
AROUND THE DIMMER SWITCH.

160
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:55,047
I KNOW THE FLOOR'S
KIND OF RUSTY THERE.

161
00:06:55,113 --> 00:06:58,317
BUT THAT SHOULD HOLD HER,
AND DO IT PROPERLY.

162
00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:00,419
YOU KNOW, THAT WILL TAKE YOU

163
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:03,922
MAYBE 10 TO 15 MINUTES
TO DO IT RIGHT, YOU KNOW?

164
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:05,657
ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT,

165
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:08,827
YOU'VE GOTTA DO THE WINDOWS
AND THE DOORS

166
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:10,729
AND ALL THE RUST HOLES.

167
00:07:14,232 --> 00:07:15,500
ALL RIGHT.

168
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:17,436
THAT IS ONE TIGHT-SEALED VAN.

169
00:07:17,502 --> 00:07:19,104
ALL'S I HAVE TO DO IS GO

170
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:21,673
TO THE FILL-UP STATION
AND LOAD 'ER UP

171
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,676
WITH A YEAR-AND-A-HALF'S SUPPLY
OF GASOLINE.

172
00:07:24,743 --> 00:07:27,579
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND--

173
00:07:28,747 --> 00:07:30,015
OH, GOLLY.

174
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,616
ALL RIGHT, OK, RE-THINK.

175
00:07:31,683 --> 00:07:33,685
THE MARK OF A TRUE HANDYMAN IS

176
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:36,588
HIS ABILITY TO ADAPT
TO CHANGING CONDITIONS.

177
00:07:36,655 --> 00:07:39,191
SAFETY REGULATIONS,
THAT KIND OF THING.

178
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:41,293
WHAT AM I GONNA DO HERE?

179
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:45,130
MAYBE A SNORKEL UNIT
OF SOME KIND OR...

180
00:07:45,197 --> 00:07:46,631
MAYBE RADIO CONTROL...

181
00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:48,133
I KNOW!

182
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,901
YOU KNOW THE FLYING BRIDGE,

183
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:52,037
LIKE THEY HAVE
ON CABIN CRUISERS?

184
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,606
YEAH, I'LL MOVE
THE WHOLE DASHBOARD UNIT

185
00:07:54,673 --> 00:07:56,141
UP ONTO THE ROOF AND...

186
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,843
OK, NO, NO, NO.

187
00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:02,147
GONNA NEED A WHOLE NEW
DASHBOARD UNIT.

188
00:08:02,214 --> 00:08:04,483
OH, OH, OH, OH!

189
00:08:04,549 --> 00:08:06,318
THIS HAS TO BE GOOD NEWS

190
00:08:06,384 --> 00:08:09,287
FOR ALL YOU SMALL-CAR OWNERS
OUT THERE.

191
00:08:09,354 --> 00:08:12,123
I'VE HOOKED EVERYTHING UP
TO RUN THE UNIT.

192
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,525
I DUCT-TAPED HER ON.

193
00:08:13,592 --> 00:08:15,327
YOU MIGHT WANT TO WELD IT.

194
00:08:15,393 --> 00:08:17,496
I'D SUGGEST YOU DO YOUR WELDING

195
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:20,065
BEFORE YOU FILL THE VAN
WITH GASOLINE.

196
00:08:20,131 --> 00:08:22,634
KEEP AN EYE OUT
FOR THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT

197
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:24,669
ON THE LOW BRIDGES AND SO ON.

198
00:08:24,736 --> 00:08:27,172
(Starting engine)

199
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:28,807
LET'S GIVE HER A TEST DRIVE.

200
00:08:28,874 --> 00:08:31,543
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

201
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,678
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

202
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:39,251
(Honking "Shave And A Haircut,
Two Bits")

203
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:44,756
(Red): STAY TUNED FOR RANGER GORD 
PRETENDING HE'S A TREE.

204
00:08:44,823 --> 00:08:46,691
HE'S GOT TO EXAGGERATE
HIS I.Q.

205
00:08:49,861 --> 00:08:51,529
ANY DAY NOW,
YOU'LL BE SHAVING

206
00:08:51,696 --> 00:08:53,999
OR SCRAPING PIZZA CHUNKS
OFF YOUR FOREHEAD.

207
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,134
YOU'LL LOOK IN THE MIRROR

208
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:58,803
AND SEE THAT YOUR FACE
IS COVERED WITH WRINKLES.

209
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,007
ALL AROUND YOUR MOUTH,
YOUR EYES, UP OVER YOUR EARS.

210
00:09:02,073 --> 00:09:03,642
WHEN YOU FURROW YOUR BROW,

211
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,444
LOOKS LIKE A RUMP ROAST
MADE OUT OF CORDUROY.

212
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:08,446
(Audience laughing)

213
00:09:08,513 --> 00:09:10,849
WRINKLES IS CAUSED
BY ONE THING ONLY.

214
00:09:10,915 --> 00:09:13,251
YOU GOT TOO MUCH SKIN.

215
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:15,720
YOU GO TO A COSMETIC SURGEON,

216
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,589
THEY'RE HAPPY
TO CUT THE SKIN OFF FOR YOU,

217
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:18,690
OR IF YOU'RE ON A BUDGET,

218
00:09:18,757 --> 00:09:21,459
I GUESS YOU COULD
DUCT-TAPE WIRES TO THE SKIN

219
00:09:21,526 --> 00:09:22,894
AND THEN TIGHTEN IT

220
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:25,463
WITH A LITTLE WINCH
HIDDEN IN YOUR HAT.

221
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:29,467
HERE'S A SIMPLE WAY TO GET RID
OF WRINKLES -- PUT ON WEIGHT.

222
00:09:29,534 --> 00:09:30,969
(Audience laughing)

223
00:09:31,035 --> 00:09:33,972
OH, YEAH, YOU JUST EAT
AND EAT AND EAT

224
00:09:34,038 --> 00:09:36,975
UNTIL YOU FILL UP
ALL THAT EXTRA SKIN.

225
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,944
YOU SEE, MOTHER NATURE
GAVE YOU THAT SKIN,

226
00:09:40,011 --> 00:09:42,480
THINKING YOU'D BE
A LOT FATTER BY NOW.

227
00:09:42,547 --> 00:09:44,082
DON'T LET HER DOWN.

228
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:45,717
IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE.

229
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:48,820
FAT IS THE SAFEST
AND SIMPLEST CURE FOR WRINKLES.

230
00:09:48,887 --> 00:09:49,988
YOU EVER SEE A WRINKLED PIG?

231
00:09:50,054 --> 00:09:51,089
NO, SIR.

232
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:54,492
FILL YOUR FACE EVERY DAY,

233
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,127
AND ONE DAY,
WHEN YOUR HEART EXPLODES,

234
00:09:56,194 --> 00:09:59,864
AND YOUR FRIENDS ARE LEANING
OVER YOUR EXTRA-WIDE COFFIN,

235
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:02,367
THEY'LL COMMENT
ON HOW YOUNG YOU LOOK.

236
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:04,536
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

237
00:10:04,602 --> 00:10:06,504
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

238
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:08,640
(Applause and cheering)

239
00:10:08,706 --> 00:10:10,608
RANGER GORD IS GONNA TEACH US

240
00:10:10,675 --> 00:10:13,511
HOW TO AVOID BEING ATTACKED
BY GRIZZLY BEARS.

241
00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:14,913
THAT'S RIGHT, RED.

242
00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:18,349
IN THE 16 YEARS I'VE BEEN
MANNING FIREWATCH TOWER 13,

243
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,885
I'VE NEVER ONCE BEEN MAULED
BY A BEAR.

244
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:23,922
I'VE BEEN ATTACKED BY FOXES
AND WOLVES AND DEER

245
00:10:23,988 --> 00:10:26,157
AND ELK AND BADGERS
AND SQUIRRELS.

246
00:10:26,224 --> 00:10:28,493
A HUMMINGBIRD
WILL GIVE A GOOD NIP.

247
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,963
OH, AND THAT CHIPMUNK SCAR
IS JUST STARTING TO HEAL.

248
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,966
NO, WE DON'T NEED TO SEE THAT.

249
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:38,303
I'VE NEVER ONCE -- NOT ONCE --
BEEN MAULED BY A BEAR.

250
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:40,238
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?

251
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:41,806
GOOD SENSE, I WOULD SAY.

252
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:43,141
NO.

253
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:44,475
NO WAY.

254
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:46,177
NO, CAMOUFLAGE, OK?

255
00:10:46,244 --> 00:10:49,447
NOW, BEARS LIKE TO EAT FISH
AND GRUB,

256
00:10:49,514 --> 00:10:53,985
SO I NEVER EVER DRESS UP
LIKE A FISH OR A GRUB, OK?

257
00:10:54,052 --> 00:10:57,989
AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO
SOMETIMES, I AVOID IT.

258
00:10:58,056 --> 00:11:00,591
I DRESS UP LIKE A TREE.

259
00:11:00,658 --> 00:11:06,831
NOW, THESE ARE ASH BRANCHES,
AND AN ASH LOOKS LIKE THIS.

260
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:08,166
SEE THAT?

261
00:11:08,232 --> 00:11:09,500
YEAH.

262
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:10,835
I'M AN ASH.

263
00:11:10,902 --> 00:11:13,004
TOOK THE WORDS
RIGHT OUT OF MY MOUTH.

264
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:16,307
YOU HOLD THE BRANCHES
LIKE THIS, LIKE THIS,

265
00:11:16,374 --> 00:11:18,209
OR EVEN AS MUCH AS THIS,

266
00:11:18,276 --> 00:11:22,280
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FOOL
A RABBIT, LET ALONE A BEAR.

267
00:11:22,346 --> 00:11:25,950
THE KEY TO DRESSING UP
LIKE A TREE IS THE SHAPE.

268
00:11:26,017 --> 00:11:27,452
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, GORD.

269
00:11:27,518 --> 00:11:28,786
NO, WAIT.

270
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:30,288
I HAVE ANOTHER ONE.

271
00:11:30,354 --> 00:11:33,458
THIS IS MY FAVOURITE,
SO IF YOU'D HOLD THAT...

272
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:34,959
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

273
00:11:35,026 --> 00:11:36,461
HOLD IT IN YOUR FINGERS.

274
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:37,962
HERE WE GO -- WATCH THIS.

275
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:39,464
OK, OK, OH, YEAH.

276
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,798
ISN'T THIS FUN?

277
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:42,133
OH, MY GOSH!

278
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,468
WATCH THIS.

279
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:45,470
THIS MUST BE MY FAVOURITE.

280
00:11:45,536 --> 00:11:47,038
IT MUST BE.

281
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,808
THERE, OK?

282
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,143
YEAH.

283
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,478
WHAT AM I?

284
00:11:53,544 --> 00:11:56,481
DON'T ASK ME QUESTIONS
LIKE THAT, GORD.

285
00:11:56,547 --> 00:11:58,482
I'M A WHITE BIRCHBARK.

286
00:11:58,549 --> 00:11:59,984
YOU SEE THAT?

287
00:12:00,051 --> 00:12:01,986
YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE ME.

288
00:12:02,053 --> 00:12:03,321
NO.

289
00:12:03,387 --> 00:12:04,655
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

290
00:12:04,722 --> 00:12:06,991
ABOUT THE SAME AS ALWAYS.

291
00:12:07,058 --> 00:12:08,993
OH, YEAH?

292
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,063
GAS FUMES GETTING TO YOU,
ARE THEY, HAROLD?

293
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:15,733
WELL... THAT WAS CLEAN
WHEN I PUT IT ON.

294
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,668
THE WHOLE TOWN'S GOING
THAT WAY.

295
00:12:17,735 --> 00:12:19,203
PEOPLE WEARING DISGUISES

296
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,539
SO THEY CAN STEAL GAS
FROM EACH OTHER,

297
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:23,374
AND PEOPLE HOARDING
THEIR GAS SUPPLY.

298
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:27,545
A GALLON OF PREMIUM UNLEADED IS
30 BUCKS ON THE BLACK MARKET.

299
00:12:27,612 --> 00:12:31,248
IF YOU BUY 10 GALLONS, YOU GET
A FREE BLACK-MARKET CAR WASH.

300
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:32,950
WE GOT A REAL ENERGY CRISIS.

301
00:12:33,017 --> 00:12:34,552
IT'S LIKE THE '70's,

302
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:37,755
BUT WE DON'T GET THE FUN
OF BLAMING FOREIGNERS.

303
00:12:37,822 --> 00:12:39,290
ONE GUY ORDERED A PIZZA.

304
00:12:39,357 --> 00:12:41,692
WHEN THE DRIVER WENT
TO GET THE MONEY,

305
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,861
SOMEONE SIPHONED GAS
FROM HIS CAR.

306
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:45,463
(Audience laughing)

307
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:46,964
REALLY?

308
00:12:47,031 --> 00:12:49,033
BOY, THAT'S BAD.

309
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,968
PEOPLE ARE PUTTING
LOCKING GAS CAPS

310
00:12:51,035 --> 00:12:52,503
ON THEIR LAWN MOWERS.

311
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,906
I BOUGHT FIVE GALLONS OF GAS
FROM FLINTY McCLINTOCK.

312
00:12:55,973 --> 00:12:57,842
TURNED OUT TO BE APPLE CIDER.

313
00:12:57,908 --> 00:13:00,478
MIND YOU, THE VAN
STILL RAN PRETTY GOOD.

314
00:13:00,544 --> 00:13:03,481
THE EXHAUST SMELLED
LIKE A WALDORF SALAD.

315
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:05,549
(Audience laughing)

316
00:13:05,616 --> 00:13:07,918
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT PORTION.

317
00:13:07,985 --> 00:13:10,421
THIS WEEK, WE HAVE TWO EXPERTS:

318
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:13,991
MY UNCLE RED
AND WINSTON ROTHSCHILD!

319
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:18,896
(Applause and cheering)

320
00:13:18,963 --> 00:13:22,066
HERE'S OUR FIRST LETTER
AND IT GOES AS FOLLOWS:

321
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:25,402
"DEAR EXPERTS, MY DAD SAYS
I SHOULD STAY IN SCHOOL

322
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:26,937
"AND GET AN EDUCATION.

323
00:13:27,004 --> 00:13:29,840
"I WANT TO GET OUT
AND GET MY DREAM JOB
 NOW.

324
00:13:29,907 --> 00:13:31,342
"WHAT DO YOU THINK?"

325
00:13:31,408 --> 00:13:34,311
THAT'S NO CONTEST --
GET OUT AND GET THE JOB.

326
00:13:34,378 --> 00:13:36,514
A DEGREE'S JUST
A PIECE OF PAPER.

327
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,015
JUST A SECOND, NOW.

328
00:13:38,082 --> 00:13:41,452
THE ROAD TO A HIGHER EDUCATION
IS NOT A ONE-WAY STREET.

329
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,053
TAKE ME, FOR EXAMPLE.

330
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,955
I TOOK AN ALTERNATIVE ROUTE.

331
00:13:45,022 --> 00:13:46,557
AFTER I QUIT HIGH SCHOOL

332
00:13:46,624 --> 00:13:50,528
AND STARTED ROTHSCHILD'S SEWAGE
AND SEPTIC SUCKING SERVICES,

333
00:13:50,594 --> 00:13:53,464
IT WAS AFTER THAT
THAT I GOT MY COLLEGE DEGREES,

334
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:54,865
IN MY SPARE TIME.

335
00:13:54,932 --> 00:13:57,167
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF GREAT

336
00:13:57,234 --> 00:13:59,103
LEARNING INSTITUTIONS
FOR ANYBODY

337
00:13:59,169 --> 00:14:00,938
WHO CAN READ A MATCHBOOK COVER.

338
00:14:01,005 --> 00:14:02,473
(Audience laughing)

339
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,074
RIGHT NOW,

340
00:14:04,141 --> 00:14:06,277
I'M WORKING ON A DEGREE

341
00:14:06,343 --> 00:14:07,778
FROM M.I.T.

342
00:14:07,845 --> 00:14:11,782
NOT THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE
OF TECHNOLOGY.

343
00:14:11,849 --> 00:14:14,485
NO, MURRAY'S SCHOOL OF TENNIS.

344
00:14:14,551 --> 00:14:16,020
THE WAY
I SEE IT,

345
00:14:16,086 --> 00:14:18,889
IF I GET MY, UH, Ph.B.
FROM MURRAY'S,

346
00:14:18,956 --> 00:14:21,058
THAT WILL BE NINE IN TOTAL.

347
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,493
OH, YEAH --
NINE.

348
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:23,928
THAT'S RIGHT.

349
00:14:23,994 --> 00:14:27,398
WINSTON ROTHSCHILD, Ph.B.,
LL.X., S.O.L., I.O.U.,

350
00:14:27,464 --> 00:14:30,434
D.O.A., V.C.R., P.D.Q., Q.T.,

351
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:32,936
AND, OF COURSE, T. & A.

352
00:14:33,003 --> 00:14:34,438
(Audience laughing)

353
00:14:34,505 --> 00:14:35,973
LOOK WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

354
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,108
YOU'RE RUNNING
A SEWAGE BUSINESS.

355
00:14:38,175 --> 00:14:41,278
EDUCATION'S NOT WORTH IT --
JUST GO FOR THE JOB.

356
00:14:41,345 --> 00:14:43,347
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY EDUCATION.

357
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:46,016
ALL YOU'RE DOING
IS HOSTING THIS SHOW.

358
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,818
YOU'RE NO BETTER THAN ME.

359
00:14:47,885 --> 00:14:51,455
YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE BOTH
IN THE SEWAGE BUSINESS?

360
00:14:51,522 --> 00:14:53,957
(Audience laughing)

361
00:14:54,024 --> 00:14:58,495
WELL, YEAH,
BUT I TAKE IT AWAY.

362
00:14:58,562 --> 00:15:01,465
(Laughing and applause)

363
00:15:01,532 --> 00:15:04,134
(Cheering)

364
00:15:04,201 --> 00:15:06,637
(Red): MEANWHILE, BACK
WITH BUFFALO BILL...

365
00:15:06,703 --> 00:15:07,971
I MEAN...

366
00:15:08,038 --> 00:15:09,473
OW, OW.

367
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,241
... "BUFFALO" IN THE SENSE OF

368
00:15:11,308 --> 00:15:13,977
HE'S GONNA NEED WINGS
AT SOME POINT.

369
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:16,480
BILL'S GOT--
LOOK OUT, LOOK OUT.

370
00:15:16,547 --> 00:15:17,815
OH, BOY.

371
00:15:17,881 --> 00:15:20,217
ONE THING ABOUT GOING
TO A PLAYGROUND

372
00:15:20,284 --> 00:15:23,821
WITH A FELLOW LIKE BILL,
YOU DON'T NEED TO GET INVOLVED.

373
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:27,124
KIDS, YOU STAY WELL BACK,
YOU SEE A MAN LIKE THIS.

374
00:15:27,191 --> 00:15:29,359
OH, BOY.

375
00:15:29,426 --> 00:15:30,694
OH, FOR GOSH--

376
00:15:30,761 --> 00:15:33,096
I'M STANDING THERE,
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

377
00:15:33,163 --> 00:15:34,631
WHAT HE HAS IN MIND,

378
00:15:34,698 --> 00:15:36,934
THINKING THAT
IT MUST BE SOMETHING.

379
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,435
WHAT IS IT?

380
00:15:38,502 --> 00:15:39,937
OH, YEAH, TEETER-TOTTER.

381
00:15:40,003 --> 00:15:41,438
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

382
00:15:41,505 --> 00:15:43,040
OH, FUNNY --
THAT'S VERY FUNNY.

383
00:15:43,106 --> 00:15:44,975
I GET, AS USUAL, THE SHORT END

384
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:46,476
OF THE STICK.

385
00:15:46,543 --> 00:15:49,012
I'LL SHOW YOU
WHO'S GOT THE SHORT END

386
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:51,181
OF THE WHATEVER -- OH!

387
00:15:51,248 --> 00:15:53,784
SORRY, BILL -- I FEEL TERRIBLE.

388
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,119
(Laughing)

389
00:15:56,186 --> 00:15:57,621
OH, OH, OH!

390
00:15:57,688 --> 00:16:00,190
OH, OOOH, THAT SMARTS,
YOU KNOW?

391
00:16:00,257 --> 00:16:01,692
HE GETS OFF IT.

392
00:16:01,758 --> 00:16:04,294
(Laughing)

393
00:16:04,361 --> 00:16:05,796
ALL RIGHT.

394
00:16:05,862 --> 00:16:07,331
OHHH!

395
00:16:07,397 --> 00:16:09,866
THESE PLAYGROUNDS ARE FUN,
AREN'T THEY?

396
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:12,936
WE GOT THAT UNIT APART
AND I GOT BILL'S HORSE.

397
00:16:13,003 --> 00:16:16,640
HE MOUNTS THE WHOLE UNIT
ON THE OLD WAGON WE HAD.

398
00:16:16,707 --> 00:16:20,477
STOLE SOMETHING FROM
THE HANDYMAN WORK BENCH, BILL?

399
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:22,279
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

400
00:16:22,346 --> 00:16:23,914
HOW'S THIS WORK, BILL?

401
00:16:23,981 --> 00:16:25,482
YOU'RE GONNA SIT ON...

402
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:28,018
ALL RIGHT, HE'S GONNA SIT
ON THAT END.

403
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:30,954
THE SPRING'S ATTACHED THERE,
SO... YEAH, OK.

404
00:16:31,021 --> 00:16:32,990
THE PIPE GOES DOWN HERE AND...

405
00:16:33,056 --> 00:16:34,324
OH, I KNOW, I KNOW.

406
00:16:34,391 --> 00:16:36,193
THE OLD RAILROAD CAR THING.

407
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:38,128
IF YOU CAN GET THIS PUMPING,

408
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:39,629
YOU DON'T NEED GAS.

409
00:16:39,696 --> 00:16:41,498
YOU CAN JUST PUMP UP AND DOWN

410
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:44,468
AND THAT WILL DRIVE
THE CAR FORWARD, BUT...

411
00:16:44,534 --> 00:16:47,471
IT'S GONNA BE HARD
TO GET HER STARTED, BILL.

412
00:16:47,537 --> 00:16:49,106
YOU CAN'T JUST... WHAT?

413
00:16:49,172 --> 00:16:50,807
OH, I'LL GIVE IT A PUSH.

414
00:16:50,874 --> 00:16:52,442
ALL RIGHT, FAIR ENOUGH.

415
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:53,944
OH, FOR GOSH SAKES.

416
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,446
THESE KIDS THAT DON'T
CLEAN UP THEIR ROOM.

417
00:16:56,513 --> 00:16:57,948
OH, IT'S THE HORSE.

418
00:16:58,014 --> 00:16:59,449
THE HORSE CAN DRIVE.

419
00:16:59,516 --> 00:17:02,452
BACK I GO AND GIVE HER
A LITTLE PUSH.

420
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,187
HE'LL BE ABLE TO...

421
00:17:04,254 --> 00:17:05,522
(Squeaking)

422
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:07,958
SOME GREASE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
AN IDEA.

423
00:17:08,024 --> 00:17:09,459
SLOWLY UP AND DOWN.

424
00:17:09,526 --> 00:17:11,294
THIS ISN'T GONNA GET

425
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:13,563
LOTS OF SPEED,
BUT THERE YOU GO.

426
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,765
THERE YOU ARE, THAT'S WORKING.

427
00:17:15,832 --> 00:17:19,369
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DOES
AT A HILL, BUT YOU KNOW,

428
00:17:19,436 --> 00:17:21,471
WE LEFT THE KEY TURNED ON

429
00:17:21,538 --> 00:17:24,407
AND BY GOLLY
IF SHE DIDN'T START UP.

430
00:17:24,474 --> 00:17:25,876
(Laughing)

431
00:17:25,942 --> 00:17:29,412
THAT PICKED THINGS UP
A LITTLE BIT.

432
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:32,716
WITH THE BOUNCING, THE HORSE
FELL ON THE GAS PEDAL

433
00:17:32,782 --> 00:17:34,050
AND THAT REALLY

434
00:17:34,117 --> 00:17:36,353
PICKED THINGS UP, RIGHT, BILL?

435
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:38,154
OH, BOY, OH, BOY!

436
00:17:38,221 --> 00:17:39,656
WE LOST ONE!

437
00:17:39,723 --> 00:17:41,091
MAN OVERBOARD!

438
00:17:41,157 --> 00:17:43,560
BILL, THE CAR, THE CAR--

439
00:17:43,627 --> 00:17:45,395
BILL, THE CAR.

440
00:17:45,462 --> 00:17:47,230
OH, OH, OH... OOOOH!

441
00:17:47,297 --> 00:17:49,933
WOW! OHHH!

442
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,268
BOY!

443
00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:53,937
HE LOOKS GOOD
WITH A PIPE, DOESN'T HE?

444
00:17:54,004 --> 00:17:55,639
YOU ALL RIGHT, BILL?

445
00:17:55,705 --> 00:17:56,973
WOW.

446
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,608
STAY TUNED FOR GARTH.

447
00:17:58,675 --> 00:18:01,244
HE'S BEEN ATTACKED
BY A PORCUPINE.

448
00:18:06,016 --> 00:18:10,120
I LIKE THE WAY GUYS ARE DEALING
WITH THE GASOLINE SHORTAGE.

449
00:18:10,186 --> 00:18:12,656
WE'RE MAKING VEHICLES BURN
LESS GAS.

450
00:18:12,722 --> 00:18:16,059
TAKING THE PASSENGER SEAT
WON'T SAVE ANY WEIGHT.

451
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:18,962
NO PASSENGER SEAT
MEANS NO PASSENGER.

452
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:21,264
WITHOUT YOU THERE BESIDE ME,

453
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:23,400
NOT ONLY WILL I GET
WHERE I'M GOING,

454
00:18:23,466 --> 00:18:25,201
I'LL ARRIVE IN A BETTER MOOD.

455
00:18:25,268 --> 00:18:27,137
(Audience laughing)

456
00:18:27,203 --> 00:18:29,339
THAT WOULD MAKE
A DANDY RECLINER

457
00:18:29,406 --> 00:18:31,574
ONCE I WASH THE DR. PEPPER OUT.

458
00:18:31,641 --> 00:18:34,844
IT'S GOOD YOU GUYS ARE USING
LESS FOSSIL FUEL.

459
00:18:34,911 --> 00:18:37,414
I COULDN'T BELIEVE THE EXTRA
WEIGHT YOU WERE CARRYING.

460
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,382
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

461
00:18:39,449 --> 00:18:40,717
OH!

462
00:18:40,784 --> 00:18:42,185
I MEANT YOUR VEHICLE.

463
00:18:42,252 --> 00:18:44,387
YEAH... OH!

464
00:18:44,454 --> 00:18:46,389
YOU KNOW, THE BUNCH OF US

465
00:18:46,456 --> 00:18:47,891
HAVE MADE A WAGER

466
00:18:47,957 --> 00:18:51,261
TO SEE WHO CAN GO THE FARTHEST
ON THE LEAST GAS,

467
00:18:51,327 --> 00:18:54,731
SO WE'RE CUTTING THE WEIGHT
DOWN ON OUR VEHICLES.

468
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:56,900
JUST TAKE OUT THE DUPLICATION.

469
00:18:56,966 --> 00:18:59,903
ALL'S YOU NEED ON ANY CAR
IS ONE HEADLIGHT,

470
00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:03,106
ONE MIRROR, ONE WINDOW,
ONE SEAT, ONE DOOR...

471
00:19:03,173 --> 00:19:04,607
ONE ACCIDENT.

472
00:19:04,674 --> 00:19:07,677
(Audience laughing)

473
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,548
HEY, HANDYMAN, HERE'S A TIP.

474
00:19:11,614 --> 00:19:14,751
YOU KNOW ALL THE DIFFERENT
GLUES ON THE MARKET?

475
00:19:14,818 --> 00:19:17,187
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT KIND YOU USE.

476
00:19:17,253 --> 00:19:20,890
IF YOU SPILL IT, MAKE SURE
YOU CLEAN IT UP RIGHT AWAY,

477
00:19:20,957 --> 00:19:24,327
EVEN IF IT DOESN'T SAY
"QUICK-DRYING" ON THE CAN.

478
00:19:25,695 --> 00:19:27,897
GARTH HARBLE HERE,
ANIMAL CONTROL,

479
00:19:27,964 --> 00:19:29,732
WITH ANOTHER IMPORTANT TIP

480
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:32,168
ON HOW YOU CAN CONTROL
YOUR ANIMALS.

481
00:19:32,235 --> 00:19:33,636
COME ON IN HERE, RED.

482
00:19:33,703 --> 00:19:35,138
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR ARM?

483
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:36,472
THERE YOU GO, RED.

484
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:38,308
YOU HAVE TO POINT IT OUT.

485
00:19:38,374 --> 00:19:42,378
NO ONE WOULD NOTICE IF YOU
DIDN'T MAKE A THING ABOUT IT.

486
00:19:42,445 --> 00:19:44,480
I THINK THEY'D NOTICE.

487
00:19:44,547 --> 00:19:45,815
WHAT IS IT, ANYWAY?

488
00:19:45,882 --> 00:19:47,150
WELL, PORCUPINE.

489
00:19:47,216 --> 00:19:50,320
I DIDN'T THINK A PORCUPINE
COULD THROW HIS QUILLS.

490
00:19:50,386 --> 00:19:52,956
HE CAN'T --
A BEAR CAN THROW A PORCUPINE.

491
00:19:53,022 --> 00:19:55,291
YES, WELL...

492
00:19:55,358 --> 00:19:57,160
KIDS, IF YOU LOVE ANIMALS,

493
00:19:57,226 --> 00:19:59,729
AND YOU WANT TO MAKE
A LIVING AT IT,

494
00:19:59,796 --> 00:20:03,733
MAKE SURE YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING AT ALL.

495
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,202
THEN GO TO
THE ANIMAL CONTROL CENTRE

496
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:08,237
AND THEY'LL MAKE YOU A BOSS.

497
00:20:08,304 --> 00:20:11,607
TRY TO AVOID HAVING
ANY PERSONALITY WHATSOEVER.

498
00:20:11,674 --> 00:20:14,610
GARTH, YOU HAVE
A FEATURE FOR US ON SQUIRRELS?

499
00:20:14,677 --> 00:20:15,945
HUH?

500
00:20:16,012 --> 00:20:17,280
SOMETHING ABOUT SQUIRRELS.

501
00:20:17,347 --> 00:20:18,614
WHAT?

502
00:20:18,681 --> 00:20:19,949
SQUIRRELS.

503
00:20:20,016 --> 00:20:21,551
OH, YEAH, YES, SQUIRRELS.

504
00:20:21,617 --> 00:20:24,654
IF YOU'RE GONNA TRY
TO CATCH SQUIRRELS, MAKE SURE

505
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:27,623
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING EDIBLE
IN YOUR POCKETS.

506
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,392
DON'T ASK HOW I KNOW THAT.

507
00:20:29,459 --> 00:20:31,527
GOT ANOTHER TIP
ABOUT SQUIRRELS.

508
00:20:31,594 --> 00:20:33,663
DON'T TRY TO CATCH THEM AT ALL.

509
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,364
THEY'RE NOT NICE ANIMALS.

510
00:20:35,431 --> 00:20:37,500
THEY'RE JUST RATS
WITH A HAIRDO.

511
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:39,635
I GOT A NEST OF SQUIRRELS
IN MY ATTIC,

512
00:20:39,702 --> 00:20:41,404
SO WHAT I'VE DONE IS

513
00:20:41,471 --> 00:20:43,539
I'VE STUFFED
ALL THE ATTIC HOLES

514
00:20:43,606 --> 00:20:45,441
WITH THIS SCREEN RIGHT HERE,

515
00:20:45,508 --> 00:20:48,144
SO THAT SHOULD TAKE CARE
OF THE PROBLEM.

516
00:20:48,211 --> 00:20:50,546
HOW DID YOU CHASE
THE SQUIRRELS OUT

517
00:20:50,613 --> 00:20:52,648
BEFORE YOU PUT THE SCREEN UP?

518
00:20:52,715 --> 00:20:55,151
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

519
00:20:55,218 --> 00:20:56,652
OH, BOY.

520
00:20:56,719 --> 00:20:59,655
YOU'VE PROBABLY TRAPPED
THOSE SQUIRRELS IN THERE.

521
00:20:59,722 --> 00:21:02,158
(Squirrels chittering)

522
00:21:02,225 --> 00:21:04,594
I'LL TAKE THE SCREEN DOWN
FOR YOU.

523
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,262
YEAH, OK, WELL, MAKE SURE

524
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:08,764
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING EDIBLE
IN YOUR POCKETS.

525
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:10,099
ALL RIGHT.

526
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,168
WELL, ANOTHER SUPER DAY.

527
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,605
SORRY.

528
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:18,574
I HOPE THAT WAS A COIN
OR SOMETHING.

529
00:21:21,711 --> 00:21:23,112
NICE WORK, HAROLD.

530
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:25,114
WELL, GOOD NIGHT,
EVERYBODY.

531
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:26,616
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

532
00:21:26,682 --> 00:21:28,050
NO, SIR.

533
00:21:28,117 --> 00:21:30,186
WE'RE GONNA TELL 'EM
WHAT HAPPENED.

534
00:21:30,253 --> 00:21:33,522
OUR MOST-FUEL-EFFICIENT
VEHICLE THING, THAT WENT FINE.

535
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:36,759
THEN MR. CONSCIENCE FIGURES
HE'LL STICK HIS NOSE IN.

536
00:21:36,826 --> 00:21:39,862
I ONLY SAID
HONESTY'S THE BEST POLICY.

537
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:41,964
YOU FORCED US TO GO
TO RALPHIE'S

538
00:21:42,031 --> 00:21:44,066
AND ADMIT
WE'D BEEN STEALING GAS

539
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:46,035
AND OFFER TO PAY WHAT WE OWED

540
00:21:46,102 --> 00:21:48,638
IF HE WENT BACK TO BEING
A GAS STATION.

541
00:21:48,704 --> 00:21:51,040
A SUGGESTION,
THAT'S ALL IT WAS.

542
00:21:51,107 --> 00:21:52,508
WELL, HERE'S THE KICKER.

543
00:21:52,575 --> 00:21:54,577
HE'D NEVER NOT BEEN
A GAS STATION.

544
00:21:54,644 --> 00:21:57,213
HE EXPANDED TO BE
A CONVENIENCE STORE, TOO.

545
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,781
THE GAS PUMPS WERE THERE,

546
00:21:58,848 --> 00:22:02,018
BEHIND THE CHIPS, MAPS,
KEY FOBS, AND CARPETING.

547
00:22:02,084 --> 00:22:05,421
HOW COME GAS STATIONS
HAVE TO BE DEPARTMENT STORES?

548
00:22:05,488 --> 00:22:08,491
YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY
THAT THE GAS SHORTAGE IS OVER.

549
00:22:08,557 --> 00:22:10,593
YOU MADE US TELL THE TRUTH
FOR NOTHING.

550
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,294
THAT'S A CARDINAL SIN.

551
00:22:12,361 --> 00:22:14,597
YOU'D UNDERSTAND
IF YOU WERE MARRIED.

552
00:22:14,664 --> 00:22:17,099
(Possum squeal)

553
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,601
IT'S MEETING TIME,
UNCLE RED.

554
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:19,969
YOU GO AHEAD, HAROLD.

555
00:22:20,036 --> 00:22:21,604
THE MEN ARE WAITING FOR YOU.

556
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,105
OH, OK.

557
00:22:23,172 --> 00:22:26,342
OHHHH!

558
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:27,810
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

559
00:22:27,877 --> 00:22:29,979
I'M COMING HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

560
00:22:30,046 --> 00:22:31,847
I'LL GAS UP THE WEED-WHACKER.

561
00:22:31,914 --> 00:22:33,949
YOU'LL SEE OUT
THE WINDOWS AGAIN.

562
00:22:34,016 --> 00:22:36,685
TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

563
00:22:36,752 --> 00:22:39,722
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND HAROLD AND THE GANG,

564
00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:41,624
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

565
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:46,695
(Applause and cheering)

566
00:22:46,762 --> 00:22:54,637
(Possum squeal)

567
00:22:54,703 --> 00:22:56,138
(Harold): ALL RISE!

568
00:22:56,205 --> 00:22:58,207
ALL RISE!

569
00:23:00,709 --> 00:23:04,113
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

570
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,582
(Red): SIT DOWN.

571
00:23:06,649 --> 00:23:07,917
EXCUSE ME FOR INTERRUPTING.

572
00:23:07,983 --> 00:23:09,251
WHO RAN OVER MY HAT?

573
00:23:09,318 --> 00:23:10,586
NEXT TIME, WAIT

574
00:23:10,653 --> 00:23:11,921
TILL I'M OUT OF IT!
