1
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:11,010
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW!"

2
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:13,113
AND NOW HERE'S A MAN WHO
DOESN'T JUST FLIRT
WITH DISASTER,

3
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,481
HE BUYS
HER A DRINK.

4
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:15,982
YOUR HOST,
YOUR HERO,
MY UNCLE,

5
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,951
RED GR-E-E-E-N!

00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:30,630
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

7
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:33,800
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

8
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,401
APPRECIATE IT.

9
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:37,737
BIT OF DISAPPOINTMENT
UP AT THE LODGE
THIS WEEK.

10
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:39,606
WE HAD OUR ANNUAL MAN
OF THE YEAR AWARD,

11
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:41,908
WHICH I KIND OF HAD
MY EYE ON THERE.

12
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,409
BUT FLINTY McCLINTOCK WON IT,

13
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:45,378
AND I COME IN SECOND.

14
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:46,980
WHAT DID YOU WIN
THE AWARD FOR?

15
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:50,650
MOST FERMENTED BEVERAGES
CONSUMED AT AN
INDOOR EVENT?

16
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:54,854
NO, HAROLD, THIS IS AN AWARD FOR
SPENDING A LOT OF TIME UP HERE.

17
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,892
I'M REALLY SURPRISED
THAT FLINTY BEAT YOU.

18
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,660
I MEAN, YOU SPEND A LOT
OF TIME HERE AT THE LODGE

19
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,428
DOING...

20
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,831
YOU KNOW, BEING HERE.

21
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:08,034
YEAH, WELL, FLINTY WAS
HERE 364 DAYS LAST YEAR.

22
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,069
WOW, THAT'S EVERY DAY BUT
CHRISTMAS I GUESS?

23
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:11,838
NO, WELL, HE WAS
HERE ON CHRISTMAS,

24
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,539
BUT HIS BRANDY
STUFFING EXPLODED,

25
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:15,275
AND HE SPENT 24 HOURS
IN THE TOP OF A TREE,

26
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,944
AND THE JUDGES WOULDN'T
LET HIM COUNT IT.

27
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:20,446
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, I'M KIND
OF GLAD FLINTY WON, YOU KNOW.

28
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:23,216
MAYBE IT WILL MAKE UP FOR
THE FACT THAT HIS WIFE
LEFT HIM TODAY.

29
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,217
WHAT?

30
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,319
YEAH.

31
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:27,720
HE DOESN'T
EVEN KNOW YET.

32
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:29,856
I GUESS HE DOESN'T
SPEND MUCH TIME AT HOME.

33
00:01:29,922 --> 00:01:31,924
WELL, THAT'S NOT
VERY SUPPORTIVE.

34
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:34,861
THE GUY WINS MAN OF THE YEAR;
SHE'S NOT EVEN THERE TO
CONGRATULATE HIM?

35
00:01:34,927 --> 00:01:36,462
COME ON, WHAT
DO YOU EXPECT?

36
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,798
HE IGNORED HER
FOR OVER A YEAR.

37
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:42,502
THERE'S A LESSON TO BE
LEARNED IN THERE, UNCLE RED.

38
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:44,704
FLINTY WAS FIRST
TO LOSE HIS WIFE,

39
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,774
BUT MAYBE YOU'LL
COME IN SECOND.

40
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,443
DON'T BE CRAZY, HAROLD.

41
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,947
MAYBE I'LL JUST
GO GIVE BERNICE
A PHONE CALL, EH?

42
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:56,816
HAROLD?
HAROLD?

43
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:58,785
928 --
YEAH, OKAY, OKAY.

44
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:14,400
[QUIRKY UPBEAT MUSIC]

45
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,736
KIND OF A WING-DING OF
AN EPISODE THIS TIME AROUND.

46
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,938
A LOT OF ENGINEERING
INVOLVED IN THIS SHOW,

47
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:22,442
I MEAN, WE'VE GOT THE OTHER
STUFF TOO, WHICH IS PRETTY
MUCH FILLER I GUESS YOU KNOW,

48
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:25,144
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF
REALLY GOOD ENGINEERING
PHYSICAL STUFF.

49
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,213
SO STAY TUNED AND LEARN.

50
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:32,985
AH, THE MINISTRY OF NATURAL
RESOURCES HAS ANNOUNCED

51
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,654
THAT ANYONE CATCHING FISH

52
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,689
AND THEN RELEASING THEM BACK
INTO THE WATERS OF POSSUM LAKE

53
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:40,026
WILL BE CHARGED WITH
CRUELTY TO ANIMALS.

54
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:41,828
GOOD TO KNOW.

55
00:02:41,894 --> 00:02:43,763
HAROLD,

56
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,866
DID AUNT BERNICE SAY
ANYTHING TO YOU ABOUT
GOING ANYWHERE?

57
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,701
SHE'S NOT AT HOME.
I WAS JUST WONDERING.

58
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:50,436
NO, NOT TO ME,
YOU KNOW.

59
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,638
I MEAN, WHY WOULD SHE
SAY ANYTHING TO ME?

60
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:53,839
WEREN'T YOU HOME LAST NIGHT?

61
00:02:53,906 --> 00:02:55,041
YEAH, I WAS HOME, HAROLD.

62
00:02:55,107 --> 00:02:56,342
DID YOU HAVE DINNER
AT HOME LAST NIGHT?

63
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,277
OF COURSE
I DID, HAROLD.

64
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,447
WAS AUNT BERNICE
THERE THEN?

65
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,719
YEAH, YEAH, SHE WAS HOME.
SHE MADE ME TURN THE T.V. OFF.

66
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:09,989
WELL, DID SHE SAY
ANYTHING AT THAT TIME?

67
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:12,158
YEAH, YEAH.

68
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:13,492
YOU KNOW WHAT? SHE WAS
TALKING ABOUT BOSNIA.

69
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:15,962
NO, NO, THAT WAS THE
LADY ON THE RADIO.

70
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:17,263
I'M NOT SURE.

71
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,131
YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
AROUND YOU, DO YOU?

72
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:22,368
WHAT WAS HER DAY LIKE?
WHAT WAS SHE WEARING?

73
00:03:23,602 --> 00:03:25,071
AUNT BERNICE IS SUPPOSED
TO BE THE WOMAN YOU LOVE,

74
00:03:25,137 --> 00:03:29,508
AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED AT THE DINNER
TABLE LAST NIGHT.

75
00:03:29,575 --> 00:03:32,645
WELL, THANK YOU, GERALDO.

76
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,981
WELL, AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I DO KNOW WHAT WENT ON, OKAY?

77
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:37,450
WE HAD STUFFED PORK CHOPS;
WE HAD BAKED POTATOES, LOADED;

78
00:03:37,516 --> 00:03:40,419
WE HAD CANDIED CARROTS,
AND WE HAD APPLE PIE
FOR DESSERT.

79
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:43,322
UNCLE RED, I'M TALKING ABOUT
WHAT YOU REMEMBER IN YOUR
HEART AND YOUR MIND,

80
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,691
NOT JUST IN
YOUR STOMACH.

81
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:48,594
WE ALL KNOW THAT
HAS TOTAL RECALL.

82
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:53,632
WE LOVE THE WORDS THAT
WEDDINGS BRING

83
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:56,902
LOVE AND HONOUR AND
A BEAUTIFUL RING

84
00:03:56,969 --> 00:03:59,805
BRIDES AND GROOMS,
MAIDS AND MEN

85
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,407
MOM AND DAD

86
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:02,742
BARBIE AND KEN

87
00:04:02,808 --> 00:04:06,579
BUT ONE THING'S TRUE
BOTH NEAR AND FAR

88
00:04:06,645 --> 00:04:08,981
TWO WORDS THAT
SHOULD NEVER JOIN

89
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:12,985
ARE CASH AND BAR

90
00:04:14,653 --> 00:04:17,089
IT'S TIME TO PLAY THE
POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME,

91
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,091
AND THIS WEEK, WE'RE PLAYING
FOR FANTASTIC PRIZES.

92
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,193
Mr. DOUGIE FRANKLIN HAS
AN OPPORTUNITY TO WIN

93
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,932
A FIVE-PIECE BEDROOM SET WHICH
INCLUDES A BEDROLL, A BEDPAN
AND THREE MAGAZINES.

94
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:30,035
OKAY. UNCLE RED --

95
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:35,741
UNCLE RED HAS 30 SECONDS TO
GET  Mr. DOUGIE FRANKLIN
TO SAY THIS WORD --

96
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:37,309
COVER YOUR EARS --

00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,947
MANNERS.
MANNERS.

98
00:04:42,014 --> 00:04:43,349
YEAH,
YEAH,
YEAH.

99
00:04:43,415 --> 00:04:44,750
30 SECONDS, AND GO.

100
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,218
ALL RIGHT, DOUGIE,

101
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:47,720
WOMEN LIKE A
MAN WHO HAS...

102
00:04:47,786 --> 00:04:50,856
A QUIET
EXHAUST SYSTEM.

103
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,791
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

104
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:55,694
WHEN A MAN IS POLITE AROUND
WOMEN, THAT'S A SIGN  OF...

105
00:04:55,761 --> 00:04:58,564
DESPERATION.

106
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:03,502
OKAY, OKAY, DOUGIE, YOU HAVE A
PERSON WHO BELCHES AND PICKS
THEIR TEETH AT THE TABLE...

107
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,437
MOM!

108
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:08,040
LET ME FINISH HERE.
SORRY.

109
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:10,809
WHEN SOMEONE BELCHES AT THE
TABLE, THAT'S A SIGN  OF BAD ...

110
00:05:10,876 --> 00:05:13,312
BURRITOS.

111
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,147
YOU'RE ALMOST OUT
OF TIME, UNCLE RED.

112
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:18,384
ALL RIGHT DOUGIE, WHEN YOU BELCH
AT THE TABLE, YOUR MOM SAYS
MIND YOUR...

113
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,952
SPRAY.

114
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,888
OH, DISGUSTING.

115
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:23,889
WELL, ONLY IF YOU
HIT SOMEBODY.

116
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,557
COME ON,
I GOT MANNERS.

117
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:28,861
(FRANTIC BELL RINGING)

118
00:05:30,462 --> 00:05:32,164
YOU KNOW, THIS CURRENT
RECYCLING CRAZE

119
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:35,100
HAS MADE ME FEEL A BIT GUILTY
ABOUT ALL THOSE YEARS I
NEVER RECYCLED ANYTHING

120
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:37,336
EXCEPT BEER AND
MY OWN COOKING.

121
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,471
SO THIS WEEK ON
HANDYMAN CORNER,

122
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:42,408
I'M TAKING ON A MAJOR
RECYCLING PROJECT.

123
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:47,613
NOW, I KNOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO SEPARATE OUT YOUR POP
CANS AND YOUR NEWSPAPERS
AND PLASTICS,

124
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:50,849
BUT THAT'S PRETTY WHOOSY,
SMALL POTATOES IF YOU ASK ME.

125
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,152
I WANNA DO SOMETHING THAT'S
A LITTLE MORE IMPRESSIVE,

126
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:55,020
I WANNA DO
SOMETHING BIG.

127
00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:56,955
I'M THINKIN'...

128
00:05:57,022 --> 00:05:58,824
HOW ABOUT A CITY BUS?
HOW ABOUT THAT?

129
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,794
HOW MANY POP CANS IS
THIS ONE WORTH?

130
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,796
I GOT THIS UNIT FOR 50 BUCKS.

131
00:06:03,862 --> 00:06:05,431
50 BUCKS.

132
00:06:05,497 --> 00:06:08,000
OH, YEAH, A LOT OF PARTS ARE
MISSING, AND IT DOESN'T
RUN TOO GOOD,

133
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:09,935
BUT 50 BUCKS?

134
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:13,405
BOY, OUR SOCIETY'S VALUES
ARE ALL SCREWED UP.

135
00:06:13,472 --> 00:06:15,073
NOW, YOU COULD MAKE
ANYTHING OUT OF THIS.

136
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,476
YOU COULD MAKE A --

137
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:21,446
WELL, YOU'RE REALLY ONLY
LIMITED BY YOUR OWN IMAGINATION.

138
00:06:21,513 --> 00:06:22,915
TELL YOU WHAT
I'M GONNA DO,

139
00:06:22,981 --> 00:06:25,717
I'M GONNA TURN THIS THING
INTO A CIGARETTE CAR.

140
00:06:25,784 --> 00:06:28,620
YOU KNOW HOW THEY'VE
GOT THE CIGARETTE BOATS

141
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:30,055
WHERE THE DRIVER SITS
WAY AT THE VERY BACK

142
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:31,723
THEN THE HOOD GOES WAY
OUT IN FRONT OF HIM?

143
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,026
I'M GONNA MAKE THE VERSION
OF THAT FOR THE ROAD!

144
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:36,495
YEAH, I'VE ALREADY GOT
THE BACKSEAT TO DRIVE FROM,

145
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,664
AND I'VE GOT THE BIG, LONG HOOD,

146
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,866
EXCEPT RIGHT NOW IT'S A ROOF.

147
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:57,916
ALL RIGHT. I HAD TO SWITCH TO
THE SAWS, AWHILE THERE,

148
00:06:57,983 --> 00:07:00,319
'CAUSE I CUT THROUGH THE TORCH,

149
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:01,520
BUT I GOT HER ALL SET.

150
00:07:01,586 --> 00:07:03,588
SHE'S PRETTY MUCH DONE NOW.

151
00:07:03,655 --> 00:07:06,591
JUST GOT TO CUT DOWN ABOVE
THE WINDOWS AND DROP THAT
WHOLE ROOF DOWN,

152
00:07:06,658 --> 00:07:07,893
AND THAT'S GOING
TO BE MY HOOD,

153
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,394
THEN I'M DONE.
THAT'S IT.

154
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:12,230
WELL, NO, I'VE GOT TO HOOK UP
THE STEERING AT THE BACK

155
00:07:12,297 --> 00:07:15,467
AND THEN THE BRAKE AND THE GAS

156
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:17,636
AND THE CLUTCH, STANDARD,

157
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,271
THEN THE TRANSMISSION

158
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:21,406
AND THEN THE TURN SIGNALS,
GET HER SAFETIED,

159
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:23,408
THAT'S A WRAP.

160
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:28,780
AND THERE YOU HAVE IT,
THE WORLD'S FIRST CIGARETTE CAR.

161
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:30,415
IS SHE A BEAUTY OR WHAT?

162
00:07:30,482 --> 00:07:31,683
NOT MUCH ON SEATING,

163
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,686
BUT YOU CAN'T BEAT
HER FOR LEG ROOM.

164
00:07:34,753 --> 00:07:36,555
KINDA LOOKS LIKE A
BATMOBILE OR SOMETHING.

165
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:38,123
I COULD BE A SUPERHERO.

166
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,891
(IMITATING 'BATMAN' THEME SONG)

167
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,793
BUS BOY!

168
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:46,198
WELL, LET'S TAKE HER FOR A SPIN
BEFORE THEY TIGHTEN UP THE
TRANSPORTATION LAWS.

169
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:52,671
THIS ISN'T A STREETCAR
NAMED DESIRE,

170
00:07:52,737 --> 00:07:54,973
IT'S A BUS CALLED HORSE.

171
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,949
I WANNA TALK TO YOU OLDER GUYS
OUT THERE FOR A SEC.

172
00:08:04,015 --> 00:08:07,452
SOONER OR LATER YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO REPLACE THAT LAWN MOWER,

173
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:13,191
AND EVEN THAT ELECTRIC DRILL
THAT YOU BOUGHT WHEN YOU STARTED
DOING YOUR OWN DENTAL WORK.

174
00:08:13,258 --> 00:08:16,094
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE AT
THE AGE WHERE

175
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:20,732
THESE ARE PROBABLY THE LAST ONES
OF THOSE YOU'RE GONNA BUY FOR
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

176
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:22,667
THINK ABOUT HOW LONG
YOU'VE HAD THAT DRILL,

177
00:08:22,734 --> 00:08:25,403
AND HOW MANY YEARS THAT
MOWER RAN FOR YOU, EH?

178
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,006
SO WHAT YOU'RE BUYING
NOW ARE NOT POWER TOOLS,

179
00:08:28,073 --> 00:08:31,943
THEY'RE FUTURE HEIRLOOMS.

180
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,715
SO IF YOU WANT TO BE REMEMBERED
AS A GREAT GUY, GET THE BEST.

181
00:08:36,781 --> 00:08:38,750
DON'T JUST GET
AN ELECTRIC DRILL.

182
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:42,554
TREAT YOURSELF TO A VARIABLE
SPEED CORDLESS WITH THE
EXTRA BATTERY.

183
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:44,422
AND DON'T JUST GET A LAWN MOWER.

184
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:49,494
GET A LAWN TRACTOR WITH
THE PADDED SEAT AND THE
DRINK HOLDER.

185
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:53,064
MAYBE EVEN EMBOSS YOUR
NAME ACROSS THE FRONT.

186
00:08:53,131 --> 00:08:54,799
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE PRICE.

187
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:56,034
IT'S NOT YOUR MONEY,

188
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:57,802
IT'S THEIR INHERITANCE.

189
00:08:57,869 --> 00:09:02,741
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

190
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:09,180
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU
ONE THING ABOUT MEN...

191
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:13,084
ONCE YOU GET OUR ATTENTION,
THERE'S NO STOPPING US.

192
00:09:13,151 --> 00:09:15,420
YOU SAY THAT LIKE
IT'S A GOOD THING.

193
00:09:15,487 --> 00:09:16,821
OH, IT IS, HAROLD.

194
00:09:16,888 --> 00:09:19,124
I MEAN, EVER SINCE FLINTY'S
WIFE MADE A RUN FOR IT,

195
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,292
A BUNCH OF US LODGE MEMBERS
GOT TALKING AND -- MAYBE --

196
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:23,461
HEY, MAYBE WE'RE TAKING
OUR WIVES FOR GRANTED.

197
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:25,363
AND WE DECIDED TO HAVE
A SPECIAL LODGE WEEKEND,

198
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,867
HAVE ALL THE WIVES COME UP AND
JUST DO WHATEVER THEY WANT.

199
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:31,603
WHAT THEY WILL
WANT TO DO IS LEAVE.

200
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:33,171
I DON'T
THINK SO, HAROLD.

201
00:09:33,238 --> 00:09:34,372
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

202
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:35,507
I THINK THEY'RE GOING
TO WANT TO GO FISHING.

203
00:09:35,573 --> 00:09:36,741
WHY? THEY NEVER DID BEFORE.

204
00:09:36,808 --> 00:09:38,676
YOU WANNA
KNOW WHY?

205
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:40,779
BECAUSE WE NEVER LET THEM
DECIDE WHAT KIND OF FISH
TO FISH FOR, SEE?

206
00:09:40,845 --> 00:09:42,113
THAT'S ALL
CHANGED NOW.

207
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,281
WE'RE SENSITIVE NOW.

208
00:09:43,348 --> 00:09:45,617
WE'RE NEW MEN.

209
00:09:45,683 --> 00:09:46,918
WELL, THEN, YOU'RE
GONNA NEED NEW FISH

210
00:09:46,985 --> 00:09:49,053
BECAUSE THERE'S NONE
IN POSSUM LAKE.

211
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,422
SEE, IT'S NOT
ABOUT FISHING.
NO?

212
00:09:51,489 --> 00:09:54,559
JUST SITTING IN THE BOAT TALKING
ABOUT WHATEVER THEY WANT
TO TALK ABOUT...

213
00:09:54,626 --> 00:09:58,129
CARS, T.V. SHOWS, FAMILY.

214
00:09:58,196 --> 00:10:00,665
I HOPE IT'S NOT
ABOUT FAMILY.

215
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:03,034
DON'T WORRY, I THINK THEY'LL
JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT LEAVING.

216
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:04,769
NO, HAROLD.
NO, NO.

217
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:07,172
WE'RE TURNING ALL OUR CABINS
INTO HONEYMOON SUITES, HAROLD.

218
00:10:07,238 --> 00:10:08,439
IT'LL BE FANTAS --
LOOK AT THIS,

219
00:10:08,506 --> 00:10:10,742
I'VE GOT CHRISTMAS LIGHTS,
ALL RED BULBS.

220
00:10:10,808 --> 00:10:14,012
AND I'M PUTTING THESE
CURTAINS OVER THE WINDOWS.

221
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,449
THEY'RE ROMANTIC AND
CHEAPER THAN GLASS.

222
00:10:18,516 --> 00:10:21,653
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TAKE AUNT
BERNICE TO A NICE HOTEL?

223
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:25,089
OH, HAROLD, HOTELS DON'T
HAVE WHAT POSSUM LODGE HAS.

224
00:10:25,156 --> 00:10:28,393
I KNOW. IF THEY DID,
THEY'D BE CONDEMNED.

225
00:10:30,028 --> 00:10:32,564
ALL RIGHT. THIS HERE IS KIND
OF THE ANTIQUE ROADKILL
SHOW KIND OF DEAL,

226
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,733
WHERE LODGE MEMBERS BRING
IN SOMETHING OF VALUE,

227
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:41,739
AND WE GOT DALTON HUMPHREY,
WHO'S  KINDA AN EXPERT ON
CURIOS, COLLECTIBLES AND CRAP,

228
00:10:41,906 --> 00:10:42,874
TELL THEM WHAT IT'S WORTH.

229
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:44,242
TAKE IT AWAY, DALTON.

230
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:45,510
THANK YOU, RED.

231
00:10:45,576 --> 00:10:47,879
AND WITH ME TODAY HERE IS
BUSH PILOT, BUZZ SHERWOOD.

232
00:10:47,946 --> 00:10:51,449
H-E-E-E-Y! HOW'S
IT GOING, HUMPSTER?

233
00:10:53,051 --> 00:10:54,152
HOW'S IT HANGING?

234
00:10:54,218 --> 00:10:57,055
A LITTLE LOOSER NOW, THANK YOU.

235
00:10:57,121 --> 00:10:59,123
DID YOU BRING US
ANYTHING TODAY, BUZZ?

236
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,358
OH, YEAH.

237
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:03,428
IT'S LIKE ONE OF THOSE
WIND SPINNY THINGS.

238
00:11:03,494 --> 00:11:06,764
YOU KNOW, YOU GET THEM ON THE
ROOF OF THE BARN, RIGHT?

239
00:11:06,831 --> 00:11:07,899
A WEATHER VANE!

240
00:11:07,965 --> 00:11:10,935
OKAY, OKAY.
WELL, WELL.

241
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:12,236
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

242
00:11:12,303 --> 00:11:14,806
I FOUND IT...

243
00:11:14,872 --> 00:11:19,210
STUCK TO THE PONTOONS
ON MY PLANE.

244
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:21,279
DO YOU KNOW WHO MADE THIS?

245
00:11:21,345 --> 00:11:23,247
YEAH, I THINK IT'
A GUY NAMED SWEN.

246
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:24,148
SVEN?

247
00:11:24,215 --> 00:11:25,917
NO, NOT SVEN... SWEN.

248
00:11:25,983 --> 00:11:29,854
S-W-E-N,
SWEN.

249
00:11:29,921 --> 00:11:33,224
NO, YOU SEE, BUZZ,
THESE ARE DIRECTIONS,

250
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,392
LIKE "N" FOR NORTH,

251
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:35,760
EAST, SOUTH, WEST,

252
00:11:35,827 --> 00:11:36,994
LIKE THE COMPASS IN YOUR PLANE,

253
00:11:37,061 --> 00:11:39,597
YOU KNOW, IF YOUR
PLANE HAD ONE.

254
00:11:39,664 --> 00:11:41,032
OH, OKAY SURE.

255
00:11:41,098 --> 00:11:42,467
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT'S WORTH, MAN?

256
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:43,601
IT'S LIKE A BUNDLE?

257
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:44,802
NO, NO, NO, NO.
NOT MUCH, NO, NO.

258
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:46,237
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT'S DAMAGED.

259
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:48,806
SO, YOU KNOW, I WOULD
JUST GIVE IT TO ME,

260
00:11:48,873 --> 00:11:52,410
THEN I WON'T BE INCLINED TO
WANT TO TELL ANYONE ABOUT
YOUR LITTLE INCIDENT,

261
00:11:52,477 --> 00:11:54,045
LIKE THE AIRPLANE POLICE.

262
00:11:54,111 --> 00:11:55,947
OH, SURE, MAN.
THAT'S COOL.

263
00:11:56,013 --> 00:11:57,748
HEY, DO YOU WANT
TO BUY SOME LAUNDRY?

264
00:11:57,815 --> 00:11:59,617
NO, NOT REALLY,
NOT UNLESS IT'S MY SIZE.

265
00:11:59,684 --> 00:12:02,220
WELL, IT PROBABLY IS BECAUSE
IT WAS YOUR CLOTHESLINE.

266
00:12:07,592 --> 00:12:09,727
HEIGH-HO, WELCOME TO THE EXPERT
PORTION OF THE SHOW

267
00:12:09,794 --> 00:12:12,930
WHERE WE EXPLORE THOSE THREE
LITTLE WORDS THAT MEN FIND
SO HARD TO SAY...

268
00:12:12,997 --> 00:12:16,867
Audience:  I DON'T KNOW.

269
00:12:17,602 --> 00:12:19,937
OKAY, JOINING ME AND UNCLE RED
ON THE EXPERT PORTION OF
THE SHOW THIS WEEK IS

270
00:12:20,004 --> 00:12:24,475
Mr. WINSTON ROTHSCHILD OF
THE ROTHSCHILD'S SEWAGE AND
SEPTIC SUCKING SERVICES.

271
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:27,378
THANK YOU.

272
00:12:29,046 --> 00:12:30,581
WHERE OUR MOTTO IS...

273
00:12:30,648 --> 00:12:34,118
IF YOUR EYES ARE STINGING,
MY PHONE SHOULD BE RINGING.

274
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:38,589
OKAY.

275
00:12:39,357 --> 00:12:41,158
TODAY'S LETTER READS...

276
00:12:41,225 --> 00:12:44,462
"DEAR EXPERTS, EVERY SUMMER
AND FALL, MY WIFE MAKES
FRUIT PRESERVES,

277
00:12:44,528 --> 00:12:47,732
"THEY'RE PRETTY
MUCH INEVITABLE,"

278
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,634
OR DOES THAT SAY "INEDIBLE?"

279
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:53,070
THEY'RE EITHER
INEVITABLE OR INEDIBLE.

280
00:12:53,137 --> 00:12:55,539
PROBABLY BOTH, HAROLD.

281
00:12:55,606 --> 00:13:00,011
"HOW CAN I SHOW HER I REALLY
APPRECIATE HER PRESERVES
WITHOUT EATING ANY?"

282
00:13:00,077 --> 00:13:01,479
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

283
00:13:01,545 --> 00:13:03,280
I FIND THE FRUIT PRESERVES
ARE KIND OF LIKE NECKTIES,

284
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:05,182
IT'S SOMETHING YOU
GET AT CHRISTMAS

285
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:09,587
FROM PEOPLE WHO EITHER DON'T
LIKE YOU, OR ARE TOO CHEAP
TO BUY YOU A REAL GIFT.

286
00:13:09,653 --> 00:13:10,388
EXACTLY.

287
00:13:10,454 --> 00:13:11,856
FOR INSTANCE,

288
00:13:11,922 --> 00:13:15,760
I GIVE MY MOM'S PRESERVES TO
CUSTOMERS WHO HAVEN'T PAID.

289
00:13:15,826 --> 00:13:17,528
OH, YEAH. IT SENDS
A REAL MESSAGE.

290
00:13:17,595 --> 00:13:22,900
OH, AND IF THEY EAT 'EM,
GENERATES A LOT MORE BUSINESS.

291
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:32,309
WINSTON, YOU BETTER
HOPE YOUR MOM'S
NOT WATCHING.

292
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:35,713
THIS SHOW?
NOT A CHANCE.

293
00:13:37,848 --> 00:13:40,217
YOU KNOW, ANOTHER THING
WITH THE PRESERVES, YOU KNOW,

294
00:13:40,284 --> 00:13:42,786
YOU GUYS COULD BE DONATING
THEM TO, LIKE, FOOD BANKS.

295
00:13:42,853 --> 00:13:46,624
OH, COME ON, HAROLD, THOSE
PEOPLE HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS.

296
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:51,428
SEE, NO ONE SAID PRESERVES
HAD TO BE EATEN, EH?

297
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:54,832
AND MY MOM'S PRESERVES
MAKE GREAT PAINT.

298
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:57,935
OH, YEAH. THEY ARE COLOURFUL,
AND THEY STICK TO ANYTHING.

299
00:13:58,002 --> 00:14:01,071
I USE IT TO UNDERCOAT
THE HONEY WAGON.

300
00:14:01,138 --> 00:14:02,706
I THINK YOU GUYS ARE
MISSING THE POINT HERE

301
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:04,842
'CAUSE THE OPERATIVE WORDS THAT
THIS FELLOW WRITES ARE...

302
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:07,711
"HOW CAN I SHOW HER I REALLY
APPRECIATE HER EFFORTS?"

303
00:14:07,778 --> 00:14:10,881
OH, RIGHT. OKAY.

304
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:19,023
WELL, I THINK, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE, LIKE, YOU KNOW,

305
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:20,224
TELL HER THE TRUTH.

306
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,259
MAYBE YOU JUST DON'T
LIKE HER PRESERVES,

307
00:14:22,326 --> 00:14:24,194
BUT, YOU KNOW, CREDIT HER FOR
THINGS THAT YOU DO REALLY
APPRECIATE ABOUT HER.

308
00:14:24,261 --> 00:14:25,562
WELL, THAT'S
A GOOD POINT

309
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:28,299
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, CHANCES ARE,
SHE'S FAIRLY ATTRACTIVE.

310
00:14:28,365 --> 00:14:30,901
WELL PRESERVED!

311
00:14:32,736 --> 00:14:35,039
OH, RIGHT.
YEAH, I GET IT!

312
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:39,276
THIS WEEK ON
ADVENTURE WITH BILL,

313
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:41,312
HE INVITED ME
TO COME OVER.

314
00:14:41,378 --> 00:14:44,481
HE WAS GONNA ACTUALLY
MAKE AN ELEVATOR HE HAD
AS HIS PROJECT.

315
00:14:44,548 --> 00:14:47,217
YEAH, UP AND DOWN.
YEAH, VERY GOOD,
EXCELLENT.

316
00:14:47,284 --> 00:14:49,086
THAT'S GOOD WORK, BILL.

317
00:14:49,153 --> 00:14:53,357
HE NEEDED A CLOTHESLINE HERE,
SO I THOUGHT I'D SPEED
THINGS UP A LITTLE.

318
00:14:53,424 --> 00:14:55,259
THERE WE GO.

319
00:14:55,325 --> 00:14:57,528
YOU'RE WELCOME.

320
00:14:57,594 --> 00:15:00,631
ALL RIGHT. NOW, I GUESS
THE CLOTHESLINE IS,
I WOULD IMAGINE,

321
00:15:00,698 --> 00:15:03,634
PART OF THE ELEVATOR RIGGING.

322
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,669
YOU KNOW, THIS IS SOMETHING FOR
YOU YOUNGSTERS, YOU KNOW,

323
00:15:05,736 --> 00:15:07,604
SOMETHING A LITTLE LATER IN
LIFE AND ALL THROUGH YOUR
LIFE...

324
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:09,773
YOU HAVE A BUDDY, YOU GO UP,

325
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:14,411
AND YOU JUST DO THINGS ON A
SATURDAY OR EVEN ON A TUESDAY
IF YOU HAVE MY WORK ETHICS.

326
00:15:14,478 --> 00:15:17,047
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT BRINGS
A LOT OF PLEASURE TO YOU.

327
00:15:17,114 --> 00:15:19,817
AND BILL IS GOING TO --

328
00:15:19,883 --> 00:15:22,486
YEAH, OKAY, I DRIFTED
OFF A LITTLE THERE.

329
00:15:22,553 --> 00:15:24,455
I THINK IT'S THE MEDICATION
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

330
00:15:24,521 --> 00:15:28,459
ANYWAY, HE'S GOING TO HOOK UP
THE PULLEY, THIS IS THE PULLEY
FROM THE CLOTHESLINE.

331
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:30,327
HOOK THAT ON TO THE BEAM
OVER THE SHED HERE.

332
00:15:30,394 --> 00:15:33,864
YOU BETTER MAKE SURE THAT'S
SOLID, MAKE THAT SOLID,

333
00:15:33,931 --> 00:15:35,299
THAT'S GOT TO SUPPORT
THE WHOLE WEIGHT THERE.

334
00:15:38,035 --> 00:15:39,570
THAT WAS UNFORTUNATE.

335
00:15:39,636 --> 00:15:41,271
YEAH, SHE'S GOOD, SHE'S GOOD.

336
00:15:41,338 --> 00:15:43,707
THAT WAS GOOD TO
CHECK THAT OUT.

337
00:15:43,774 --> 00:15:45,175
ALL RIGHT. THAT'S GOING
TO BE THE UPPER PULLEY.

338
00:15:45,242 --> 00:15:47,177
NOW YOU NEED SOME KIND OF A --

339
00:15:47,244 --> 00:15:51,348
HE'S GOT A WHEEL
IN HIS PANTS THERE

340
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:55,919
AND, OH, AN ENTIRE
CYCLE IN THERE.

341
00:15:55,986 --> 00:15:58,222
I GUESS HE'S GOING
THROUGH THE CYCLE.

342
00:15:58,288 --> 00:16:03,327
ANYWAY, THIS IS GOING TO
ACTUALLY BE THE VEHICLE THAT'S
GOING TO BE THE ELEVATOR.

343
00:16:03,393 --> 00:16:04,928
UNBELIEVABLE.

344
00:16:04,995 --> 00:16:07,598
SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO, KIDS,
WITH A LITTLE IMAGINATION?

345
00:16:07,664 --> 00:16:09,066
HE RUNS THE ROPE UP AROUND THE
WHEEL, UP THROUGH THE PULLEY
AND DOWN THROUGH AROUND
THE WHEEL.

346
00:16:09,132 --> 00:16:10,567
SEE? AROUND THE WHEEL,

347
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:12,035
AND IT'S KIND OF A LOOSE FIT,

348
00:16:12,102 --> 00:16:14,104
BUT AS HE PEDALS,
IT WILL WIND UP THE CORD,

349
00:16:14,171 --> 00:16:19,176
AND THAT'S THE CLOTHESLINE
AND PULL HIM UP TO WHEREVER
IT IS HE WANTS TO GO.

350
00:16:19,242 --> 00:16:21,244
UP WHERE WE BELONG,
AS THEY USED TO SAY.

351
00:16:21,311 --> 00:16:23,413
AND THE CHAIN BROKE.
THE CHAIN BROKE THERE.

352
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,085
THE CHAIN.
THE CHAIN.

353
00:16:28,151 --> 00:16:29,386
YEAH, THERE IT IS.
YEAH, THERE IT IS.

354
00:16:29,453 --> 00:16:31,655
YEAH BROKEN.
YEAH BROKEN.

355
00:16:31,722 --> 00:16:36,159
ALL RIGHT, HE'S GOT THE
CHAIN BACK TOGETHER AND THE
HANDYMAN'S SECRET CHAIN REPAIR.

356
00:16:36,226 --> 00:16:40,530
THERE NOW, HE'S ALL SET
TO GO, AND AWAY YOU GO,
BILL, WAY YOU GO.

357
00:16:40,597 --> 00:16:42,566
I AM REAL EXCITED
BECAUSE I'M NOT DOING IT.

358
00:16:42,632 --> 00:16:44,234
LOOK AT THAT, EH?

359
00:16:44,301 --> 00:16:45,936
LOOK AT THAT.
UP HE GOES.

360
00:16:46,002 --> 00:16:48,038
WOW! HE'S SLIPPING A LITTLE,
BUT HE'S GETTING THERE.

361
00:16:48,105 --> 00:16:52,542
THIRD FLOOR, LADY'S LINGERIE,
WEIRD GUYS ON KIDS' BIKES.

362
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:55,011
THEY'VE GOT THE WHOLE
RANGE IN THIS STORE.

363
00:16:55,078 --> 00:16:58,648
AND WHEN HE WANTS TO STOP
ALL HE'S GOT TO DO IS
JAM ON THE BREAKS.

364
00:16:58,715 --> 00:17:01,118
JAM 'EM ON.
JAM 'EM ON.
JAM 'EM ON.
JAM 'EM ON.

365
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:02,652
THERE, THE CHAIN BROKE.

366
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,988
CHAIN BROKE.
CHAIN BROKE.
CHAIN BROKE.

367
00:17:05,055 --> 00:17:07,124
GOING DOWN.

368
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,391
OH, BOY.

369
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,427
ARE YOU OKAY THERE, BILL?

370
00:17:10,494 --> 00:17:12,696
NOW, YOU KNOW, ULTIMATELY,
IN THE ELEVATOR BUSINESS,

371
00:17:12,763 --> 00:17:15,065
IT'S NOT THE UPS
AND DOWNS THAT GET YOU,

372
00:17:15,132 --> 00:17:17,334
IT'S THE JERKS.

373
00:17:21,138 --> 00:17:23,874
THE GUYS ARE ALL FIXING UP THEIR
CABINS FOR THE WIVES COMING UP.

374
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:27,244
IT'S REALLY STARTING TO HEAT UP.
WE'RE ACTUALLY MAKING A LITTLE
COMPETITION OUT OF IT,

375
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,146
SEEING WHO CAN BE THE MOST
THOUGHTFUL TO THEIR WIFE,

376
00:17:29,212 --> 00:17:31,848
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A MARRIED
MAN OF THE YEAR AWARD,

377
00:17:31,915 --> 00:17:33,049
AND I GOT A REAL
GOOD SHOT AT IT.

378
00:17:33,116 --> 00:17:34,417
YOU SHOULD SEE MY CABIN.

379
00:17:34,484 --> 00:17:37,454
LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF
ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST.

380
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:41,124
OR, ARCHITECTURAL
INDIGEST.

381
00:17:41,191 --> 00:17:42,526
OH, COME ON, NOW, HAROLD,
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

382
00:17:42,592 --> 00:17:45,729
I THREW TWINKLE LIGHTS
UP OVER THE RHINO HEAD.

383
00:17:45,795 --> 00:17:47,531
OH, YEAH.

384
00:17:47,597 --> 00:17:49,332
I GOT A COUPLE OF LAMPS THAT
ACTUALLY HAVE SHADES,

385
00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:51,101
AND SINCE BERNICE
AND I DON'T SMOKE,

386
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:54,437
I'M TURNING THE ASHTRAYS
INTO SNACK BOWLS.

387
00:17:55,438 --> 00:17:58,008
WELL, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO
SOME TO BEAT BUSTER HADFIELD.

388
00:17:58,074 --> 00:18:01,311
YEAH, HE'S GOT LIKE SHAG
CARPETING AND COVERED
ORGAN SPEAKERS

389
00:18:01,378 --> 00:18:03,213
AND A LAWN JOCKEY
THAT HOLDS INCENSE.

390
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,848
YEAH.

391
00:18:04,914 --> 00:18:09,552
HE'S GOT THE WHOLE CABIN
DONE UP, LIKE, IN THAT
ZEBRA-STRIPED FUN FUR STUFF.

392
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:10,920
GEE, LOOKS SO COOL.

393
00:18:10,987 --> 00:18:12,756
LOOKS LIKE THE INSIDE OF
SIEGFRIED AND ROY'S
DRESSING ROOM.

394
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:15,125
SEE, NOW, THAT'S
TOO MUCH, HAROLD.

395
00:18:15,191 --> 00:18:17,060
SEE, WOMEN DON'T GO FOR THAT,
ESPECIALLY MARRIED WOMEN.

396
00:18:17,127 --> 00:18:18,528
THEY LIKE THE SUBTLETY.

397
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:21,331
THAT'S WHY I'VE GOT JUST A
SINGLE ROSE IN A SHOT GLASS

398
00:18:21,398 --> 00:18:24,601
ON THAT OLD HALL STAND
MADE OUT OF A COW'S LEG.

399
00:18:25,502 --> 00:18:28,905
YOU KNOW, HAROLD, I'VE GOT A
REAL COZY FIRE GOING IN THERE.

400
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,175
YOUR CABIN DOESN'T
HAVE A FIREPLACE.

401
00:18:32,242 --> 00:18:35,011
WELL, I'M BEING CAREFUL.

402
00:18:35,078 --> 00:18:37,914
YOU KNOW, AUNT BERNICE
LIKES THAT SINGER,

403
00:18:37,981 --> 00:18:41,651
THAT JEWLEO ICICLES GUY?

404
00:18:41,718 --> 00:18:43,253
JULIO IGLESIAS?

405
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:44,654
WHAT DID I SAY?

406
00:18:44,721 --> 00:18:47,724
ALL RIGHT. WELL, OKAY, I'M
THINKING I CAN GET A POSTER,

407
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,059
MAYBE A COUPLE
OF HIS TAPES.

408
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,161
NO, NO, JUST BE
YOURSELF, UNCLE RED.

409
00:18:51,227 --> 00:18:53,730
YEAH, BE THE MAN THAT
AUNT BERNICE MARRIED

410
00:18:53,797 --> 00:18:56,733
OR, YOU KNOW, THAT SHE
THOUGHT SHE MARRIED,

411
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,002
OR THAT SHE WISHES
SHE MARRIED.

412
00:18:59,068 --> 00:19:00,270
ACTUALLY, YOU'RE RIGHT.

413
00:19:00,336 --> 00:19:02,372
BE THE OTHER GUY.
GO FOR THE OTHER GUY.

414
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:05,442
DOES AUNT BERNICE KNOW YOU'RE
PREPARING THIS LOVE NEST?

415
00:19:05,508 --> 00:19:08,278
ACTUALLY, I WAS JUST GOING
TO GIVE HER A CALL NOW,

416
00:19:08,344 --> 00:19:10,213
UNLESS YOU THINK MAYBE
I SHOULD MAKE IT A SURPRISE.

417
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,481
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

418
00:19:11,548 --> 00:19:12,982
WELL, IF YOU WANT HER TO COME,

419
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:15,618
YOU'RE DEFINITELY GOING TO
HAVE TO MAKE IT A SURPRISE.

420
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,455
THIS IS THE REPAIR SHOP
PART OF THE SHOW WE CALL,

421
00:19:19,522 --> 00:19:22,425
IF IT AIN'T BROKE,
YOU'RE NOT TRYING.

422
00:19:22,492 --> 00:19:25,528
MY BUDDY EDGAR MONTROSE, HERE,
HAS BROUGHT IN SOMETHING
FOR US TO FIX.

423
00:19:25,595 --> 00:19:26,896
WHAT HAVE YOU
GOT THERE, EDGAR?

424
00:19:26,963 --> 00:19:28,064
OH, HI, RED.

425
00:19:28,131 --> 00:19:31,134
I'M FINE.
THANK YOU.

426
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:35,238
OH, TODAY I BROUGHT IN THIS
STEERING WHEEL FROM MY CAR.

427
00:19:35,305 --> 00:19:37,240
WOW, HAD A BIT OF
A CAR ACCIDENT, DID YA?

428
00:19:37,307 --> 00:19:40,810
YEP, AND THAT'S THE BIT
OF THE CAR THAT'S LEFT.

429
00:19:40,877 --> 00:19:42,779
WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE OTHER CAR?

430
00:19:42,845 --> 00:19:44,180
WHAT OTHER CAR?

431
00:19:44,247 --> 00:19:45,648
NO, NO, I MEAN THE --

432
00:19:45,715 --> 00:19:48,117
OH, OH. NO, IT WAS
JUST MY CAR, RED.

433
00:19:48,184 --> 00:19:52,555
YOU SEE, I WAS EXPERIMENTING
WITH ALTERNATIVE ENERGIES.

434
00:19:52,622 --> 00:19:55,358
I WAS TRYING TO HARNESS
THE ENERGY OF THE SUN.

435
00:19:55,425 --> 00:19:56,759
THAT'S UNUSUAL.

436
00:19:56,826 --> 00:19:58,695
SOLAR POWER'S USUALLY
PRETTY SAFE.

437
00:19:58,761 --> 00:20:02,398
NOT SOLAR POWER,
NUCLEAR FUSION.

438
00:20:02,465 --> 00:20:07,537
YOU SEE, I WAS  READING
SOMEWHERE THAT THE CENTRE OF
THE SUN IS MILLIONS OF DEGREES

439
00:20:07,603 --> 00:20:12,709
AND THE PRESSURE IS SO GREAT
THAT IT JUST FORCES HYDROGEN
ATOMS TOGETHER, FUSES THEM.

440
00:20:12,775 --> 00:20:15,111
THAT'S WHERE YOU GET
YOUR ENERGY FROM.

441
00:20:15,178 --> 00:20:18,481
SO YOU WERE TRYING TO RECREATE
THE CENTRE OF THE SUN
IN YOUR GARAGE?

442
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:22,251
WELL, THAT WAS THE THEORY.

443
00:20:22,318 --> 00:20:27,457
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY HYDROGEN,
SO I HAD TO USE DYNAMITE.

444
00:20:27,523 --> 00:20:34,230
THE HARDEST THING WAS FORCING
THEM STICKS DOWN INTO
THE GAS TANK.

445
00:20:34,297 --> 00:20:36,899
SO DID YOU GET HER UP TO THE
MILLIONS OF DEGREES IN THERE,
DO YOU THINK?

446
00:20:36,966 --> 00:20:38,401
I DUNNO.

447
00:20:38,468 --> 00:20:43,239
MY THERMOMETER ONLY WENT UP TO
130, AND THEN IT JUST WENT.

448
00:20:43,306 --> 00:20:45,708
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
I GOT IT QUITE RIGHT.

449
00:20:45,775 --> 00:20:49,045
'CAUSE IT WAS A LOT
BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN

450
00:20:49,112 --> 00:20:51,414
AND A LOT LOUDER.

451
00:20:51,481 --> 00:20:55,151
WELL, THERE YOU GO, EDGAR.
BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD.

452
00:20:55,218 --> 00:20:59,388
OH, NO, MY DRAWING BOARD GOT
BLOWN HALF WAY TO PORT ASBESTOS.

453
00:21:05,094 --> 00:21:06,796
WELL, HAROLD, IT'S
JUST NOT FAIR.

454
00:21:06,863 --> 00:21:08,798
I MEAN, THE RULES OF
THE CONTEST WERE SET OUT
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING.

455
00:21:08,865 --> 00:21:10,166
WELL, I DON'T KNOW,
UNCLE RED.

456
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:12,902
THESE DAYS YOU HAVE TO
ACCOMMODATE ALTERNATIVE
LIFESTYLES.

457
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:18,541
EVERYBODY WANTS TO TAKE PART
IN THIS MARRIED MAN OF THE
YEAR COMPETITION,

458
00:21:18,608 --> 00:21:20,543
EVEN THE GUYS
THAT ARE SINGLE.

459
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:25,681
OLD MAN SEDGEWICK AND MOOSE
THOMPSON WANT TO MARRY EACH
OTHER JUST FOR THE CONTEST.

460
00:21:25,748 --> 00:21:28,684
YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE
GOING TO GET THE MARRIAGE
ANNULLED ON MONDAY.

461
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:32,488
NOT ACCORDING TO
OLD MAN SEDGEWICK.

462
00:21:32,555 --> 00:21:36,525
HE SAYS HE WANTS
TO HAVE A FAMILY.

463
00:21:36,592 --> 00:21:38,160
IT DOESN'T MATTER, I'M ALL SET.

464
00:21:38,227 --> 00:21:40,463
I'VE GOT MY CABIN
ALL READY FOR THE JUDGES.

465
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:42,365
I GOT THE LIGHTING,
I GOT THE MUSIC.

466
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:46,669
AS SOON AS I FIGURE OUT WHAT
KIND OF WINE GOES WITH
LICORICE, I'M DONE.

467
00:21:46,736 --> 00:21:48,437
(POSSUM CALL)

468
00:21:48,504 --> 00:21:49,939
MEETING TIME, UNCLE RED.

469
00:21:50,006 --> 00:21:51,574
YEAH, YOU GO AHEAD, HAROLD.
I'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.

470
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:53,643
THERE YOU GO THEN.

471
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:57,079
AND, BERNICE, IF YOU'RE WATCHING
THIS, I'M GOING TO COME HOME
STRAIGHT AFTER THE MEETING,

472
00:21:57,146 --> 00:21:59,749
I'M GOING TO JUST PICK YOU UP
AND BRING YOU UP TO THE LODGE.

473
00:21:59,815 --> 00:22:01,317
I'VE GOT A BIG SURPRISE WAITING
FOR YOU IN THE CABIN.

474
00:22:01,384 --> 00:22:03,686
DON'T GET EXCITED,
IT'S ONLY DECORATIONS.

475
00:22:03,753 --> 00:22:04,887
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,

476
00:22:04,954 --> 00:22:06,756
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

477
00:22:06,822 --> 00:22:09,191
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF, HAROLD
AND THE WHOLE GANG UP HERE
AT THE LODGE,

478
00:22:09,258 --> 00:22:11,260
YOU KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

479
00:22:11,327 --> 00:22:15,331
(APPLAUSE)

480
00:22:15,398 --> 00:22:21,871
[CAPTIONS PERFORMED BY
CAPTION RESOURCE CENTER]

481
00:22:21,937 --> 00:22:25,775
Harold:  EVERYONE
TAKE YOU SEATS!

482
00:22:28,477 --> 00:22:31,247
ALL RISE.

483
00:22:33,983 --> 00:22:36,952
Everyone:
QUANDO OMNI
FLUNKUS MORITATI.

484
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:39,855
Red:  SIT DOWN.

485
00:22:39,922 --> 00:22:41,891
Harold:  OKAY, WE ONLY GOT
THE ONE ANNOUNCEMENT TONIGHT.

486
00:22:41,957 --> 00:22:44,960
WELL, IT SEEMS THAT SOMEONE HAS
STOLEN ALL OF THE STUFF OUT
OF MY CABIN

487
00:22:45,027 --> 00:22:47,596
AND REPLACED IT WITH
A BUNCH OF JUNK FURNITURE.

488
00:22:47,663 --> 00:22:50,933
NOW, I'M TALKIN' ABOUT, LIKE,
MY VIDEO GAMES ARE MISSING

489
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,936
AND MY THIGH MASTER
AND MY RETAINER.

490
00:22:54,003 --> 00:22:56,438
NOW, YOU CAN KEEP THE CHIA PET.
THAT'S OKAY.

491
00:22:56,505 --> 00:22:59,508
BUT I WANT EVERYTHING ELSE
RETURNED TO CABIN 42
IMMEDIATELY.

492
00:22:59,575 --> 00:23:04,280
Red:  HAROLD,
YOU'RE IN CABIN 43.

493
00:23:06,448 --> 00:23:09,151
Harold:  OKAY, SO THERE'S
NO ANNOUNCEMENTS TONIGHT.
