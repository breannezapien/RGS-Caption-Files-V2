1
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:07,440
One of the things
I like doing best

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,109
is taking something
pretty normal

3
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:10,910
and then using
it in a way

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,712
that nobody's ever
thought of before.

5
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:16,583
Like, for example,
using a floor polisher
for a back massager

6
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,452
or a trolling motor
as a Cuisinart

7
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:25,125
or a British car as a reliable
means of transportation.

8
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,960
I think the big
difference is

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,095
I don't see things
the way other people do.

10
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:32,232
See, like, normal people look
at this, and what do they see?

11
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,901
They see a sprinkler on
the end of a garden hose.

12
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:38,338
I'm not normal...
thank goodness.

13
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,641
I don't see a sprinkler
on garden hose.

14
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:44,677
I see an instant
campfire.

15
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:59,893
[ cheers and applause ]

16
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:06,833
Thanks very much.

17
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,201
Appreciate it.

18
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,069
Big, big news up at
the Lodge this week.

19
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:12,272
The government has put a new
building across the lake

20
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:15,041
on top of Duff's Bluffs,
named after Figgy Duff,

21
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,743
a guy who used to get in
to arguments with his
dad all the time

22
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,077
and then threaten
to get a job.

23
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:21,447
Which is why they call it
Duff's Bluffs.

24
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:25,518
The problem is this building
is directly between us
and the TV satellite,

25
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:27,787
so now we don't
get any stations.

26
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:30,823
Well, the guys are trying to
raise the satellite dish up

27
00:01:30,823 --> 00:01:32,992
by putting the tower
on top of the lodge,

28
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:35,094
stick her up about
30 feet or so.

29
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,529
But it's not easy.

30
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:40,400
It almost makes you wish
we'd watched some of
those how-to shows.

31
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,201
Uncle Red,
what are you doing?

32
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:45,538
[ cheers and applause ]

33
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,743
I'm doing a
television show.

34
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:52,545
You know
what I mean.

35
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:55,581
That lumber was specifically
earmarked for a new dock,

36
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:57,316
a new dock that we
were supposed to build

37
00:01:57,316 --> 00:01:58,618
by order of
the government.

38
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,253
I didn't see it
as an order.

39
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:03,056
I took it more as
a bureaucratic suggestion.

40
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:07,527
It was an order,
and I take orders
very seriously.

41
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:10,096
Yes, but you're
not married.

42
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,802
The government said our old
rotten dock was ruining
the environment.

43
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,937
Well, their new building
blocking our TV signals

44
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:20,072
is ruining
my environment.

45
00:02:20,072 --> 00:02:23,643
We're fighting fire
with higher.

46
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,412
We can live without
television.

47
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:29,215
I'm going to pretend
I didn't hear that.

48
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,050
Hundreds of years ago,
people sat around at night

49
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,085
and had long
conversations.

50
00:02:33,085 --> 00:02:34,954
Right, and the life
expectancy was 37.

51
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:38,191
That's not
a coincidence.

52
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,926
Listen we'll have plenty
of wood left over

53
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,228
after we build the
darned tower to
build the dock.

54
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:44,897
We're only going up
about 30 feet or so.

55
00:02:44,897 --> 00:02:46,699
Are you sure you guys
know what you're doing?

56
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,334
What do you think,
Harold?

57
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,703
[ loud cracking sound ]

58
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:02,548
[ applause ]

59
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:11,023
It's time for the
Possum Lodge Word Game!

60
00:03:11,023 --> 00:03:16,195
[ cheers and applause ]

61
00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:23,035
Today's prize is this coupon
for a round trip ticket

62
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:25,905
to Port Asbestos!

63
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,975
"... on a big orange
school bus.

64
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,811
"Be prepared for
frequent stops."

65
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,013
All right, Hap, you gotta
cover your ears.

66
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,815
Red, you have 30 seconds
to get Hap Shaughnessy

67
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,717
to say this word...

68
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,521
Yeah, all right,
Winston.

69
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:43,989
And... go!

70
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:45,758
Okay, Hap, Hap!

71
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:48,194
What do you call it when
people stretch things?

72
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,329
Yoga.

73
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,298
Okay, no not their muscles.

74
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,833
When they stretch
the truth a little.

75
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,736
Oh, unicorn salesman.

76
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,404
No. Okay.

77
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,507
Um, when people make things
bigger than they really are,

78
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,842
what do you call that?

79
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:05,544
Breast implants.

80
00:04:06,712 --> 00:04:09,081
Okay, Hap, supposing I told you
I was abducted by aliens

81
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:10,983
and taken to Saturn and
had dinner with Elvis,

82
00:04:10,983 --> 00:04:12,218
what would I be doing?

83
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:15,621
Reading my
autobiography.

84
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:17,556
Okay. Okay.

85
00:04:17,556 --> 00:04:19,758
Okay, Hap, like,
when you tell a story,

86
00:04:19,758 --> 00:04:22,394
you always do this,
and I never do it.

87
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:24,697
Make it interesting.

88
00:04:26,031 --> 00:04:27,633
Almost out
of time, Red.

89
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:29,168
Okay, see, Hap,
you do this.

90
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:30,202
It's not exactly lying,

91
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:31,604
but it's not tellin'
the truth either.

92
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,538
What's that called?

93
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:34,473
Politics.

94
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:37,376
Yes, and you'd be a great
politician because you...

95
00:04:37,376 --> 00:04:39,979
... are a Kennedy.

96
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:44,884
Hap, you have to be the
biggest bafflegabber

97
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,418
the world has ever seen.

98
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:47,953
Oh, no,
not the biggest.

99
00:04:47,953 --> 00:04:49,288
I think you exaggerate
a little there, Red.

100
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:51,690
There we go!

101
00:05:00,532 --> 00:05:01,967
[ snoring ]

102
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:03,269
RED: Dalton,
you're snoring again.

103
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:04,970
DALTON: I am not
asleep, Red.

104
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,972
RED:
Well, you're snoring.

105
00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:08,674
I told you
I can't help it.

106
00:05:08,674 --> 00:05:12,111
[ snores ] It's a
medical condition.

107
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,879
Can't you wear
nose plugs?

108
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,981
Can't you
wear ear plugs?

109
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:17,683
Can't we all
just get along?

110
00:05:17,683 --> 00:05:19,685
Stop being
so immature.

111
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:20,953
RED: I'm not
the immature one.

112
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,221
Are so.
Am not.

113
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:23,489
Are so.
Am not.

114
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,758
Stop it!

115
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:28,827
That's enough "are so's"
for one day.

116
00:05:28,827 --> 00:05:30,362
DALTON:
What'd he say?

117
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:32,798
RED: I dunno,
but I agree with him.

118
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:35,401
Let's talk about
something else.

119
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:36,835
I had this weird
dream last night,

120
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:38,437
where I was running
down the street naked

121
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:40,472
with a mob of people
chasing me.

122
00:05:40,472 --> 00:05:43,909
Have either of you
ever experienced that?

123
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:47,246
My wife doesn't let
me watch that channel.

124
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:50,215
It's not TV,
it's a dream.

125
00:05:50,215 --> 00:05:52,551
Don't you ever
have dreams?

126
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:55,053
I used to.

127
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:57,756
When I was single
I dreamt I was Superman.

128
00:05:59,725 --> 00:06:03,495
But then I married
Kryptonite.

129
00:06:03,495 --> 00:06:05,431
Dreams can tell
a lot about you.

130
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:08,066
There are people
that make their living
interpreting dreams.

131
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:11,103
RED: Yeah, they're
called bartenders, Mike.

132
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:14,740
Mr. Green, I don't think
you should poo-poo dreams.

133
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,241
I'm not poo-pooing
anything.

134
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:18,310
I wasn't poo-pooing,
was I?

135
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,279
I hope not.

136
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,315
Mr. Green, you have a
tendency to be very negative

137
00:06:23,315 --> 00:06:25,417
towards people whose
opinions you disagree with.

138
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:27,619
RED: Oh, put a sock
in it, Mike.

139
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:29,388
Dreams are a
recognized indicator

140
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:31,690
of the
subconscious mind.

141
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,959
RED: Oh yeah?
Yeah.

142
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:36,728
Dreams can tell you a
lot about people's
brain activity.

143
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:37,896
RED: Really?

144
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:39,731
Well, I don't even
have dreams.

145
00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:41,967
See?
That proves it.

146
00:06:44,002 --> 00:06:47,239
These days you hear a lot of
hot air about saving gas.

147
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:50,042
There's only a couple
of ways to really save gas.

148
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,444
One, buy a
smaller vehicle...

149
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:54,746
yeah right.

150
00:06:54,746 --> 00:06:58,317
The other is to make your
vehicle more aerodynamic.

151
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:00,185
Now, I don't know
much about that stuff,

152
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:01,820
but I'd rather
learn something

153
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,322
than drive around
in a dinky toy.

154
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:06,091
So I looked up 'aerodynamic'
in the encyclopedia.

155
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:08,160
That took a while
until I realized

156
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,195
it started with an 'A'.

157
00:07:10,195 --> 00:07:11,797
Now, they got a bunch of
diagrams and charts,

158
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:15,400
but the basic message,
it's all about wind
resistance.

159
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,270
Driving the Possum Van
is like pushing a cow

160
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,706
through a mud bath.

161
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,709
But what if, instead of
having to go around the van,

162
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,610
the air could just
shoot right through it?

163
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,080
Like the difference
between these two racquets.

164
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,182
See, this one has a lot
of air resistance,

165
00:07:30,182 --> 00:07:32,551
so I can only
go like that.

166
00:07:32,551 --> 00:07:35,253
But the tennis racquet lets
the air go right through,

167
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:37,756
so I can go like this.

168
00:07:37,756 --> 00:07:40,058
Okay, it's the same,
but this is easier.

169
00:07:40,058 --> 00:07:41,493
Okay, let's move on.

170
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:44,730
All we need is something that
takes the air that's
hitting the van

171
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,799
and lets it pass
right through the van.

172
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:50,368
In one end
and out the other.

173
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:52,037
I'm not sure where that
expression started,

174
00:07:52,037 --> 00:07:54,706
but I'm guessing it was
during flu season.

175
00:07:54,706 --> 00:07:56,475
See, so if we can get
enough of these hoses,

176
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:59,845
we can scoop the air that's
gonna smack into the
front of the van,

177
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:02,447
and re-route it
out the back

178
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:04,783
through the van.

179
00:08:04,783 --> 00:08:07,185
Just gotta find
some openings

180
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:09,421
so I can put the hoses
straight through.

181
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:22,567
Okay, I figure I've
reduced the wind resistance

182
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:24,903
by about 30%

183
00:08:24,903 --> 00:08:28,740
and improved the appearance
of the vehicle by...

184
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,542
somewhat less than that.

185
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:34,980
So now the air flows
smoothly through the hoses,

186
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:39,150
instead of being stacked up
like Dolly Parton in
a halter top.

187
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,520
It comes out here and smacks
into the guy tailgating you.

188
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,888
[ chuckles ]

189
00:08:43,888 --> 00:08:46,091
Okay, it means I have to leave
the back doors open
all the time,

190
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:47,592
but I don't mind.

191
00:08:47,592 --> 00:08:49,594
It's cheaper than
deodorizers.

192
00:08:49,594 --> 00:08:52,197
Kinda looks like a rocket
launcher, doesn't it?

193
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:56,301
Hmmm.

194
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:11,916
Oh baby, this project
is a win-win.

195
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,619
We're saving gasoline by
reducing the wind resistance,

196
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:17,155
and we're saving gasoline by
adding this propane

197
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:19,958
auxiliary drive system.

198
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:23,561
Finally a hybrid
car I like.

199
00:09:23,561 --> 00:09:26,831
So remember, if the women
don't find you handsome,

200
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:28,299
they should at least
find you handy.

201
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:29,534
Now, if you'll excuse me,

202
00:09:29,534 --> 00:09:31,569
I've gotta go
save the environment.

203
00:09:55,727 --> 00:09:57,395
Have you seen
all the nostalgia

204
00:09:57,395 --> 00:10:00,865
that's popping up on TV
and the radio these days?

205
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:02,233
Nostalgia is fine,

206
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:05,103
but this is nostalgia
from the '80s.

207
00:10:05,103 --> 00:10:08,573
I haven't had a chance
to miss the '80s yet,

208
00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:09,841
and even if I had,

209
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:11,409
I wouldn't.

210
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:13,211
The clothes were neon,
the cars were gutless

211
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:15,213
and the music was either
made in a computer

212
00:10:15,213 --> 00:10:18,149
or by something
called "Wham".

213
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:20,351
But, see, that's the
way nostalgia works.

214
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:22,287
As things go sour
in the present,

215
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:25,456
we all start imagining they
were better in the past.

216
00:10:25,456 --> 00:10:27,992
It's why we remember
the Bee Gees so fondly

217
00:10:27,992 --> 00:10:31,963
and the Captain and Tenille
at all.

218
00:10:31,963 --> 00:10:35,066
It's all about what
you're comparing stuff to.

219
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:37,268
So I go out of my way to
introduce my wife

220
00:10:37,268 --> 00:10:40,405
to guys my own age who've
let themselves go mentally,

221
00:10:40,405 --> 00:10:43,074
physically and socially.

222
00:10:43,074 --> 00:10:46,878
I know that some day soon
that nostalgia factor
is gonna kick in,

223
00:10:46,878 --> 00:10:48,813
and she's gonna start
seeing me

224
00:10:48,813 --> 00:10:51,349
as better than
I've ever been.

225
00:10:51,349 --> 00:10:53,051
And let me tell ya,

226
00:10:53,051 --> 00:10:55,520
there'll be a
hootenanny that night!

227
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,155
Remember,
I'm pulling for ya.

228
00:10:57,155 --> 00:10:59,624
We're all
in this together.

229
00:11:02,093 --> 00:11:03,594
Call Rothschild's,

230
00:11:03,594 --> 00:11:05,897
because what goes down...

231
00:11:05,897 --> 00:11:07,899
shouldn't come up.

232
00:11:14,939 --> 00:11:18,309
Well, we had a rethink
on the TV tower

233
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:20,445
and decided to build it
from the Lodge floor up.

234
00:11:20,445 --> 00:11:22,714
That way it would be
as solid as the Lodge.

235
00:11:25,516 --> 00:11:27,251
Take it easy there, Mike.

236
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:28,886
MIKE: (mumbling)

237
00:11:28,886 --> 00:11:30,121
Pardon me?

238
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:33,024
MIKE: (mumbling)

239
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:35,159
Take the nails
out of your mouth.

240
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:40,431
MIKE:
I had nails in my mouth.

241
00:11:41,165 --> 00:11:42,400
Uncle Red,

242
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,368
I don't think you're going
to have enough lumber
left over

243
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:46,304
to build the new dock
that the government wants.

244
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:47,939
Yeah, but we got
the old dock out.

245
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:49,407
That was the
main issue.

246
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:50,942
Harold,
our boats sink.

247
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:52,577
They don't need to be
tied up to anything.

248
00:11:54,178 --> 00:11:55,780
I don't think you guys
have any idea what you're
doing at all,

249
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,783
or the damage
it's gonna do to the
world as we know it.

250
00:11:58,783 --> 00:12:02,687
If only someone had
said that to your parents.

251
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,823
I'm assuming you have
some plans to build
this tower with.

252
00:12:05,823 --> 00:12:07,124
No, we don't
need plans.

253
00:12:07,124 --> 00:12:08,759
We know a tower is
wide at the bottom

254
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,261
and comes to a
point at the top

255
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:13,030
so we're designing it
after Moose Thompson.

256
00:12:13,965 --> 00:12:15,533
It doesn't look all
that straight to me.

257
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:19,470
This could end up being
the leaning tower of PBS.

258
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,638
Look at this!

259
00:12:20,638 --> 00:12:22,306
It's not even secured
to the base.

260
00:12:22,306 --> 00:12:23,808
The weight will
hold it here, Harold.

261
00:12:23,808 --> 00:12:25,676
We used the
water-logged dock boards

262
00:12:25,676 --> 00:12:27,111
for the first platform.

263
00:12:27,111 --> 00:12:28,679
That was
like 1200 pounds

264
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:30,681
not counting
the zebra mussels.

265
00:12:30,681 --> 00:12:32,183
With that
much weight,

266
00:12:32,183 --> 00:12:33,551
gravity will
hold it in place.

267
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:35,786
Gravity is our
friend, Harold.

268
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:45,563
Red: NOTHING
CAN BE MORE RELAXING

269
00:12:45,563 --> 00:12:48,499
THAN BEING OUT FISHING
WITH A BUNCH OF BUDDIES.

270
00:12:48,499 --> 00:12:51,102
ACTUALLY, MAYBE
IT'S TOO RELAXING.

271
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:58,743
LUCKILY WE LEFT
THE MOTOR GOING.

272
00:12:58,743 --> 00:13:02,013
SO WE COME IN AND TAKE
OUR CATCH OUT OF THE BOAT.

273
00:13:02,013 --> 00:13:04,482
I HAD A PRETTY GOOD
STRINGER OF FISH THERE.

274
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:06,851
NOT TOO BAD AT ALL.

275
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:09,120
A LITTLE SUSHI ATTACK
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

276
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,588
BUT I WAS FINE.

277
00:13:10,588 --> 00:13:12,089
WALTER HAD A FAIR NUMBER.

278
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:13,691
BUT THEY WEREN'T HUGE.

279
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:16,160
IT'S OKAY,
WE HAVE CRACKERS.

280
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,729
AND BILL -- I'M NOT
SURE WHAT BILL GOT.

281
00:13:18,729 --> 00:13:21,432
HE SEEMED HAPPY ABOUT IT.

282
00:13:21,432 --> 00:13:24,802
IT'S AN UMBRELLA OR
A TV AERIAL, I DUNNO.

283
00:13:24,802 --> 00:13:27,138
SO WE'RE GETTING SET
TO HAVE OUR LITTLE COOKOUT,

284
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:28,773
BUT HAROLD WANTS
TO TAKE A PICTURE,

285
00:13:28,773 --> 00:13:30,274
YOU KNOW, THE WAY THE
GUYS HOLD UP THE FISH.

286
00:13:30,274 --> 00:13:32,009
IT'S NOT THAT HARD,

287
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:34,445
BUT WITH HAROLD, SOMETIMES,
IT'S JUST EASIER TO GO ALONG,

288
00:13:34,445 --> 00:13:35,913
GET ALONG...

289
00:13:35,913 --> 00:13:38,549
I WISH HE WOULD GO ALONG.

290
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:41,051
WATCH OUT, THERE'S A
FLASH ON THAT, HAROLD.

291
00:13:41,051 --> 00:13:42,253
BE CAREFUL.

292
00:13:42,253 --> 00:13:43,988
NO, NO, HAROLD...

293
00:13:46,624 --> 00:13:47,992
GREAT.

294
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:50,628
WHY DON'T YOU
POINT THE CAMERA

295
00:13:50,628 --> 00:13:52,229
AT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING
TO TAKE A PICTURE OF?

296
00:13:52,229 --> 00:13:53,931
THAT'S ALWAYS A GOOD --
HAROLD?

297
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:58,903
AH, STUPID...
IN FOR A LONG DAY.

298
00:13:58,903 --> 00:14:01,105
OH, NO, IT'S GOOD.

299
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:02,940
THEN WALTER DECIDES
SINCE IT'S A PHOTO OP

300
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,643
HE'S GONNA -- MAYBE HOLD IT A
LITTLE CLOSER TO THE CAMERA

301
00:14:05,643 --> 00:14:08,212
IT'LL LOOK A
LITTLE LARGER.

302
00:14:08,212 --> 00:14:09,880
THAT WAS AN
ODD LOOKIN' THING,

303
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,815
AND IT DIDN'T
SMELL ALL THAT GREAT.

304
00:14:11,815 --> 00:14:13,550
TAKE HER OVER
TO THE OTHER SIDE.

305
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,685
THERE WE GO.

306
00:14:14,685 --> 00:14:16,720
OKAY, SO HAROLD'S
GETTIN' SET NOW.

307
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,355
I GUESS HE DIDN'T
TIGHTEN HER UP ENOUGH.

308
00:14:18,355 --> 00:14:22,226
NOW, HE'S -- AND WE'RE
TRYING TO STAY WITH IT.

309
00:14:22,226 --> 00:14:24,395
THEN THE ONE LEG
STARTS TO GO,

310
00:14:24,395 --> 00:14:27,031
AND WE GOTTA
KINDA LEAN OVER.

311
00:14:27,031 --> 00:14:30,668
EVENTUALLY GRAVITY
TOOK OVER.

312
00:14:30,668 --> 00:14:36,240
SO THIS IS JUST NOT --
HAROLD, WATCH OUT FOR THE --

313
00:14:37,908 --> 00:14:40,110
SO THIS IS NOT
WORKING OUT AT ALL.

314
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,512
WE NEED A
DIFFERENT APPROACH,

315
00:14:41,512 --> 00:14:43,947
SO WALTER DECIDES HE'S GONNA
TAKE OVER AS PHOTOGRAPHER.

316
00:14:43,947 --> 00:14:46,650
AND HAROLD -- AWAY YOU GO.
AWAY YOU GO.

317
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,352
NO, JUST GO.

318
00:14:48,352 --> 00:14:49,787
YOU'RE GONNA GET ONE.
HERE IT COMES.

319
00:14:51,955 --> 00:14:53,424
AWAY YOU GO.

320
00:14:53,424 --> 00:14:55,025
ALL RIGHT SO
HAROLD COMES OVER.

321
00:14:55,025 --> 00:14:56,527
NOW WE HAVE TO
GET OURSELVES --

322
00:14:56,527 --> 00:14:58,128
WHO'S GONNA
BE IN THE MIDDLE?

323
00:14:58,128 --> 00:15:00,230
HAROLD'S TALLER, SO MAYBE
HE SHOULD BE IN THE MIDDLE.

324
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:04,435
I DIDN'T CARE, BUT BILL
WANTED TO BE IN THE MIDDLE.

325
00:15:04,435 --> 00:15:06,937
OKAY, LATER THAT DAY...

326
00:15:06,937 --> 00:15:08,939
WE'RE FINALLY SET TO GO
AND WALTER GOT --

327
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:10,274
I THOUGHT IT
WAS ALL RIGHT.

328
00:15:10,274 --> 00:15:12,042
BUT HE SAID OUR
EYES WERE CLOSED.

329
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:14,011
YEAH, I KNOW.
OKAY. OKAY.

330
00:15:14,011 --> 00:15:16,680
THE FISH EYES WE CAN'T DO
ANYTHING ABOUT WALTER, SO...

331
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,282
NOW WE'RE STARTING
TO TAKE PICTURES,

332
00:15:18,282 --> 00:15:19,950
AND WE GOT A
COUPLE OF GOOD POSES.

333
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,820
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE TAKING A
PICTURE YOU'RE FOCUSSED ON --

334
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,222
YOU DON'T SEE WHAT'S
HAPPENING IN THE BACKGROUND.

335
00:15:25,222 --> 00:15:30,594
AND, UH...
APPARENTLY, UH...

336
00:15:30,594 --> 00:15:32,029
WE WERE HAVING
A VISITOR OF SOME --

337
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:33,464
NOW, BILL SPOTTED HIM.

338
00:15:33,464 --> 00:15:34,798
AND HE WAS
TRYING TO REACT.

339
00:15:34,798 --> 00:15:36,500
AND THEN HAROLD SAW HIM,
AND, UH...

340
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,868
OF COURSE,
THEN THEY'RE GONE.

341
00:15:37,868 --> 00:15:39,102
NOW I'M ALONE,

342
00:15:39,102 --> 00:15:40,871
AND, UH, SUDDENLY
MY FISH ARE GONE.

343
00:15:40,871 --> 00:15:43,507
AND THAT WAS REALLY THE
FIRST TIME I NOTICED
SOMETHING WAS UP.

344
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:45,042
SO I SAY, HEY, HEY, HEY,
MY FISH ARE GONE.

345
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:48,078
AND THEY'RE GOIN,
"HEY, IT WASN'T ME."

346
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:51,081
AND THEN WE ALL
SPOTTED THE BEAR.

347
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:53,350
AND THEN THE BEAR SPOTS US,

348
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,652
AND THEN WE GO HOME.

349
00:15:55,652 --> 00:15:57,821
[ applause ]

350
00:16:04,194 --> 00:16:06,930
Nothing can pack it in
like a garbage truck.

351
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,700
Except maybe Moose Thompson
at a buffet.

352
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,802
The secret is compression.

353
00:16:11,802 --> 00:16:13,904
And what works for
that garbage truck

354
00:16:13,904 --> 00:16:16,974
can also work
for you.

355
00:16:16,974 --> 00:16:19,576
It's not about squeezing the
crap out of something.

356
00:16:19,576 --> 00:16:21,712
It's about squeezing the
crap into something.

357
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:25,949
If you're like me,

358
00:16:25,949 --> 00:16:28,051
you like to keep
things in your car,

359
00:16:28,051 --> 00:16:31,054
things that probably should
have gone in that truck
that just left.

360
00:16:31,054 --> 00:16:32,923
But you don't want
to throw something out

361
00:16:32,923 --> 00:16:35,625
that you might
need next week.

362
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,328
Well, here's how you
can keep everything.

363
00:16:38,328 --> 00:16:40,230
First, consolidate.

364
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:53,009
Okay, now all you need is
an extra rim attached
to your drive wheel

365
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:55,645
and a piece of chain.

366
00:16:55,645 --> 00:16:58,715
Make sure you leave
the key in the trunk,

367
00:16:58,715 --> 00:17:01,785
just like taxis do.

368
00:17:01,785 --> 00:17:03,820
And just hook the, uh --

369
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,388
Oh, darn.

370
00:17:05,388 --> 00:17:08,658
Okay, just hook the
chain onto something.

371
00:17:08,658 --> 00:17:10,060
There we go.

372
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,362
Then run her across.

373
00:17:12,362 --> 00:17:14,798
Then you just
hook the other end

374
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:17,434
onto maybe another rust hole
or a door knob.

375
00:17:17,434 --> 00:17:19,503
Oh, here we go.

376
00:17:19,503 --> 00:17:22,472
That looks safer.

377
00:17:23,807 --> 00:17:26,543
And this is how
you turn a mid-size

378
00:17:26,543 --> 00:17:28,712
into a compact.

379
00:17:37,587 --> 00:17:38,588
We're getting there.

380
00:17:38,588 --> 00:17:40,423
She just needs
a little more power.

381
00:17:58,074 --> 00:18:01,278
[ applause ]

382
00:18:02,712 --> 00:18:06,950
[ wind blowing,
wood creaking ]

383
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,818
Okay, we got the
tower finished,

384
00:18:08,818 --> 00:18:10,620
got the dish
mounted on top,

385
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,888
and we're back in business.

386
00:18:11,888 --> 00:18:14,224
And we got it all done
before the playoffs.

387
00:18:14,224 --> 00:18:18,194
Uncle Red, this tower
is over 100 feet tall!

388
00:18:18,194 --> 00:18:19,696
Who authorized that?

389
00:18:19,696 --> 00:18:21,264
Luck.

390
00:18:21,264 --> 00:18:24,467
A lumber truck dropped its
load at Dead Man's Curve.

391
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:26,336
We took it
as a windfall.

392
00:18:28,872 --> 00:18:30,874
Oh! you almost had
another windfall going.

393
00:18:30,874 --> 00:18:32,442
Every time
the tower sways

394
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:35,712
we go through a bunch
of channels on the TV.

395
00:18:35,712 --> 00:18:39,215
But I figure it's gonna
save on batteries for
the remote.

396
00:18:39,215 --> 00:18:42,318
I also noticed there's no
lightning rod on top
of this thing.

397
00:18:42,318 --> 00:18:45,722
Do you think that wise?
He asked pointlessly.

398
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:47,390
Harold, the tower's
made of wood.

399
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,292
Lightning doesn't
hit wood.

400
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:50,293
Really?
Yeah.

401
00:18:50,293 --> 00:18:52,262
Okay, well...

402
00:18:52,262 --> 00:18:54,998
Well, let's just remember
that tree that was out
by the parking lot,

403
00:18:54,998 --> 00:18:56,332
remember that?

404
00:18:56,332 --> 00:18:59,035
And last year it exploded
in the electrical storm?

405
00:18:59,035 --> 00:19:00,103
Remember that?

406
00:19:00,103 --> 00:19:03,306
If I'm not mistaken,
it, too, was made of wood!

407
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:08,244
Harold, that
was ironwood.

408
00:19:08,244 --> 00:19:10,847
Oh! Oh! Harold,
gimme a hand.

409
00:19:10,847 --> 00:19:12,982
Ah! Ah!
Spider! Spider!

410
00:19:12,982 --> 00:19:18,021
Never mind, Spiderman,
just grab the darned tower!

411

[ wood cracking ]

412
00:19:22,592 --> 00:19:24,694
Was that my back?

413
00:19:24,694 --> 00:19:26,596
No I think the tower's
breaking apart.

414
00:19:26,596 --> 00:19:28,665
Maybe we shouldn't have
used the old dock boards.

415
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:30,466
I told you that!

416
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:32,168
Come on over to this
side and help me, Harold.

417
00:19:32,168 --> 00:19:33,770
Sure.
Do you think
that's gonna work?

418
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,606
No, but you'll get a
better view of it falling.

419
00:19:36,606 --> 00:19:41,277

[ applause ]

422
00:20:00,964 --> 00:20:03,933
Well, that was totally
stupid and unnecessary.

423
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:06,703
Now, don't blame
yourself, Harold.

424
00:20:08,237 --> 00:20:10,206
A lot of good is gonna
come out of this.

425
00:20:10,206 --> 00:20:12,108
Really? Like what?

426
00:20:12,108 --> 00:20:13,743
Well, of course, you were
all wrapped up in yourself

427
00:20:13,743 --> 00:20:15,945
and didn't notice that
as the tower was falling,

428
00:20:15,945 --> 00:20:19,015
we got about 40 channels
we don't even pay for.

429

[ possum squealing ]

431
00:20:22,285 --> 00:20:23,853
You go ahead.

432
00:20:23,853 --> 00:20:26,255
I some time to put
a positive spin
on all this.

433
00:20:26,255 --> 00:20:28,491
So you're gonna
be a while.

434
00:20:30,226 --> 00:20:32,562
Um... okay,
if my wife is watching,

435
00:20:32,562 --> 00:20:36,566
uh, the tower fell over,
our dish is in the lake

436
00:20:36,566 --> 00:20:38,267
and our TV set blew up,

437
00:20:38,267 --> 00:20:40,269
but I'm hoping I'll get
a lot better reception

438
00:20:40,269 --> 00:20:42,105
when I get home.

439

And to the rest of you,
thanks for watching

440
00:20:43,406 --> 00:20:44,807
and on behalf
of myself and Harold

I'm a man,
but I can change,

451
00:21:15,805 --> 00:21:17,440
If I have to...

452
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,775
I guess.

453
00:21:19,775 --> 00:21:21,344
Okay, great news, men.

454
00:21:21,344 --> 00:21:24,814
As a result of our TV tower
falling into the lake,

455
00:21:24,814 --> 00:21:28,150
we now have
a brand new dock

456
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:31,454
with a covered walkway
all the way up to the Lodge.

457
00:21:31,454 --> 00:21:32,755
And here's the best part...

458
00:21:32,755 --> 00:21:36,492
I found out today our next
door neighbour has cable.

459
00:21:36,492 --> 00:21:38,594
And by tomorrow,
so will we.
