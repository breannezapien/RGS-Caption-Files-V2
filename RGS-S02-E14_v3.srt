1
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,009
And now it's time for the show and the great
untouched wilderness.

2
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:47,247
Well, OK, so it's a little tough, but you
know, so are the people who live up here and

3
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,948
well, they'll call it cabin fever.

4
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,350
Call it getting back to nature.

5
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,518
Call it lack of education.

6
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:52,919
Call it the Red Green Show.

7
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,622
Hey, here he is the man of the hour.

8
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,790
The guy here he is as well.

9
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,760
He's the greatest human being has ever given
me a steady job.

10
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,030
Ladies and gentlemen, the head of the lodge,
the star of the show, Mr.

11
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,365
Red Green.

12
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,068
Thank you and

13
00:01:09,168 --> 00:01:10,536
Welcome to Possum Lodge.

14
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,474
Our home is your home and looks like your
home could use a good cleaning.

15
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,610
And speaking of needing a good cleaning, say
hello Harold.

16
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,879
Oh, OK. Hello.

17
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:27,553
That's director talk for I have nothing more
to say than a somber mood actually happened

18
00:01:27,553 --> 00:01:28,588
to their lives this week.

19
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:33,059
Our lodge treasurer, Douglas says we've
pumped a bit short this month for actually

20
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:34,394
the 15th month in a row.

21
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:38,231
I think the problem is we just don't get a
lot of visitors up here possible because, you

22
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:41,434
know, we're not as well known as the other
lodges, and we're just a little bit off the

23
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,536
beaten path. And of course, the place is a
dump.

24
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:48,541
But anyway, with this, with this deficit
thing, Douglas is kind of cutting back.

25
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,076
There's no more third's at mealtime.

26
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:52,412
You've got to pay extra for toothpicks and
he's closed the pool.

27
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,681
Pool what

28
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,282
Pool? Cesspool Harold?

29
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,820
I'm just saying I don't think that, you know,
the members should start to realize there's

30
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,989
no such thing as a free lunch up here.

31
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,290
There's no such thing as a good lunch.

32
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:06,059
This is working on that, too.

33
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,861
He's got some kind of a scheme to save money
on our food bills.

34
00:02:09,695 --> 00:02:12,765
Well, maybe maybe you can just get the
members to take like normal portions.

35
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,168
It's that way we can cut back on the size of
the members.

36
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,602
Oh no, no, no, no.

37
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:19,505
He's got some kind of a buy in bulk food
scheme or something other.

38
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:21,174
And I mean, after all, we eat in bulk.

39
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:24,811
Well, OK. Well, anyone ever thought of
actually doing, you know, something to

40
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,013
generate money, like using like thought or
effort?

41
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:28,815
You know, something revolutionary?

42
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:32,885
Know that machine here is there. How much
would that be worth if I sold out to, say, a

43
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:34,487
television network or a pawn shop or
something?

44
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:35,655
Nothing.

45
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:37,323
Well, you know, next to nothing.

46
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,991
Don't read. I need my access.

47
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:40,026
Think pays for itself.

48
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,899
But why do they call like a little food
club?

49
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:48,668
You got to be a piece of food to join

50
00:02:49,835 --> 00:02:54,173
The Murray Food Club is going to let you buy
your food in bulk.

51
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,142
Not this one at a time stuff.

52
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,510
Yeah, that's right.

53
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,745
What's the point? It's cheap.

54
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,747
You bet it is. Wow.

55
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:04,617
I can't believe the savings.

56
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,652
Are you sure you calculated it right?

57
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:10,523
You try it. Einstein, Duane.

58
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:11,991
My name's Duane.

59
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,694
I can't wait till he finds out about these
savings.

60
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,496
Oh, Bill, Bill, how have you seen Eddie?

61
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,166
No. Well, can you get him?

62
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:22,401
I'm going to be changing all the food he'll
be cooking.

63
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:23,569
Oh no.

64
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,808
Make sure that he orders from the four basic
food groups dairy, meat, grain fruits,

65
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,343
vegetables. That's fine.

66
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,010
There's five food

67
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:31,344
Groups.

68
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,680
That's why we've got the Murray menu system.

69
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:39,552
Ok, now let's let's just say that you have
ordered some bacon flavored potato chips,

70
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:43,489
right? Ok, now the bacon is from your meat
group and the potatoes from your vegetable.

71
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:51,030
Oh, how about you dairy, sour cream and
onion chips and your fruit cherry licorice?

72
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:53,566
This package does have it all.

73
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,036
One. And you guys got a rag.

74
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,371
They'll just sneeze banana all over me.

75
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,777
Uncle Ret. Uncle Red, you know what, the
lodge, we're joining a food club

76
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,713
Password to get into that savings.

77
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,582
Major savings there.

78
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,016
Red, need your food value?

79
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,251
Oh, you're going to love me for this one?

80
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:14,620
Well, don't get your hopes up, Marie.

81
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,955
You know, I'll probably just break your
heart.

82
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,825
Move on the Swedish meatball.

83
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:22,194
I knew. I knew. Ooh, ooh, ooh.

84
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,898
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

85
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,175
Well, where's he going?

86
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:37,376
Sweden?

87
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:44,550
No, thanks. Say Eddie Murray here has started
up a food club.

88
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:49,421
Oh, now as large treasurer, I've calculated
we could cut our food costs in half.

89
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,391
You can plan your meals a year in advance.

90
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:57,396
We would order a year's worth of pork, a
year's worth of beans and a year's worth of

91
00:04:57,396 --> 00:04:58,030
cabbage.

92
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,798
Boy, I'm moving out that year.

93
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,067
Amen. That'll be the year of living
dangerously won't.

94
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:08,107
And next year we could order a year's worth
of chicken, a year's worth of macaroni and a

95
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:10,042
year's worth of chocolate cake.

96
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:14,813
Why don't you just take my boning knife and
plunge it into my heart?

97
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,149
What would be the savings in that?

98
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,652
I don't think any lecture for the marine,

99
00:05:20,285 --> 00:05:23,656
A year of pork, a year of pork.

100
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:28,727
Do you have any idea what a year of pork
would do to my cooking skills?

101
00:05:28,794 --> 00:05:29,228
Oh, think

102
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:31,497
Of it as a challenge every night.

103
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,898
A new way to cook pork.

104
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:37,903
Oh well, yes. Let's see the first night I
could throw it at you, and then the next

105
00:05:37,903 --> 00:05:42,408
night I could just stuff it up your nose and
the third night shish kabobs.

106
00:05:45,277 --> 00:05:47,913
Well, I will not be dictated to.

107
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,415
I need variety.

108
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:50,916
I need whimsy.

109
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:53,986
I have to cook what mood is in my heart.

110
00:05:54,653 --> 00:05:56,388
So today, why were you mad at the world?

111
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,123
Maybe just Sweden?

112
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:01,460
Well, what would you rather?

113
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:06,265
What would you like me to just become some,
some automatic machine that turns out bland

114
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,499
TV dinners every night?

115
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,737
Oh, I think want. That's it.

116
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:12,838
I quit.

117
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,073
I'm going to throw in the apron.

118
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:19,912
Here, let me help you out here.

119
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:26,118
I quit. You can make your own damn food.

120
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:27,452
Forget it.

121
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:33,659
Your cutter Ali all flew.

122
00:06:33,725 --> 00:06:35,227
Club is working out. Just great Murray.

123
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:36,762
I'll see you guys later.

124
00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:43,569
Typically, you try and save a little money
and look what happens,

125
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:47,973
Save money, according Mike calculations.

126
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:52,611
It's going to cost the Lodge thirty eight
billion dollars a week.

127
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:03,588
Roving a roving, roving eye roll.

128
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:11,797
I'm going to go roving roving hour road, a
roving roving, it's going to be swell.

129
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,001
I have no idea what the hell it is, but I
hear it pays pretty well.

130
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:30,415
This week in an Amen corner, we're going to
talk about tools, and I want to talk

131
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:36,154
specifically about the most important tool
in your toolbox and that is your hammer.

132
00:07:36,188 --> 00:07:41,593
You can use a hammer to fix anything except
digital watches and China.

133
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:46,531
Now, first hammer I want to talk about is is
a is a claw hammer if you get yourself a

134
00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:48,600
hammer and it doesn't have any instructions
with it.

135
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,835
It's pretty simple.

136
00:07:49,868 --> 00:07:54,439
You pick up the hammer and you start hitting
things and you keep hitting them until you've

137
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:58,009
built something. For example, you can use a
clock hammer to hit a nail.

138
00:08:03,515 --> 00:08:09,154
Ari, you can also use a clawhammer to put in
a screw to great when your time is at a

139
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:18,730
premium. This way, you don't have to worry
whether it's a flat head or socket head or

140
00:08:19,164 --> 00:08:21,199
Phillips or Robertson or anything of that
nature.

141
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,236
But you know, clawhammer is not the only
kind of hammer there is.

142
00:08:24,636 --> 00:08:26,571
There's also something called a ball peen
hammering.

143
00:08:26,905 --> 00:08:28,306
You know, it's not as dirty as it sounds,
unfortunately.

144
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:31,543
And this can be used also to drive in a
nail.

145
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:40,785
Or you can use the other end to an end, as
we call it, in the business to do some

146
00:08:40,785 --> 00:08:42,621
riveting is a special thing called a rivet
here.

147
00:08:43,154 --> 00:08:52,063
And OK, I think this is more for a metal
metal

148
00:08:52,697 --> 00:08:57,035
application, you know? I think you're
supposed to hammer them from the other side.

149
00:08:57,068 --> 00:08:58,770
Just let the string around them.

150
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:04,643
Oh, all right, I've I got to pry that board
off and knock, but not with this any of

151
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:09,981
clawhammer for that night drop down hammer.

152
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:18,623
Yeah. Here's my clawhammer now, I'm always
using Hammers, honey.

153
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:23,061
I'll get the ball paint. All right.

154
00:09:23,061 --> 00:09:26,831
All right. Well. I can use something else as
a hammer.

155
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:30,635
Now this is a crowbar usually used for
prying things apart.

156
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:35,240
It can also be used for those unfortunate
times when you've misplaced the keys to your

157
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:42,080
house or your car. It's not only good for
Brian that it also makes a Danny Hammer

158
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:48,820
itself. So you see, almost anything can be
used as a hammer.

159
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:52,290
For example, you take a screwdriver.

160
00:09:52,957 --> 00:09:54,993
Why not use a screwdriver as a hammer?

161
00:09:54,993 --> 00:10:00,198
If you can use a hammer to drive a screw,
you can use a screwdriver to hammer finishing

162
00:10:00,198 --> 00:10:03,735
nails along this line in there.

163
00:10:04,102 --> 00:10:07,872
You want something with a kind of a
Plexiglas or a hard handle that it's not

164
00:10:07,872 --> 00:10:08,940
going to hard anyway.

165
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:11,342
And then she goes about.

166
00:10:11,342 --> 00:10:15,480
The only thing that I would say not to use
as a hammer would be something like a rubber

167
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:23,054
mallet. I'll show you why now this is kind
of useless, but it's not completely useless.

168
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:29,827
We're going to hammer out of. But the thing
is that, you know, you've got to be sort of

169
00:10:29,827 --> 00:10:32,764
adaptable and realize that there are a lot
of things that you can you can use as a

170
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:37,068
hammer. And if you've got a big, big job to
do, you need a big hammer, you know, like a

171
00:10:37,068 --> 00:10:37,735
big nail.

172
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:42,340
Yes. Ok.

173
00:10:45,977 --> 00:10:51,049
You know, with a hammer that size and a
chainsaw, you can build a 20 by 40 foot deck

174
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:55,987
in about 15 minutes, not including sanding
and medical attention.

175
00:10:56,821 --> 00:10:59,957
So there you have it. I mean, the point of
this whole thing is that almost anything can

176
00:10:59,957 --> 00:11:03,328
be used as a hammer. There's as many hammers
as there are thumb injuries.

177
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:09,934
You can use a patio, stones or your wife's
purse or a rifle, and you can find you can

178
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:13,705
use as a hammer. So until next time,
remember, if the women don't find you

179
00:11:13,705 --> 00:11:15,373
handsome, they should at least find your
handy.

180
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,579
Carol, come back here. Bring something I can
use as a hammer.

181
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:38,563
It is autumn. I'm sitting in my duck blind
blowing on my moose call.

182
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:42,200
To me, it sounds like indigestion to a male
moose.

183
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:44,936
It makes me sound like I'm a female moose in
heat.

184
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:50,374
In about 30 seconds, he will come charging
if my gun jams.

185
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:53,544
I'll be going out on possibly the worst date
of my life.

186
00:11:59,717 --> 00:12:02,787
We may have lost Eddie as our cook, but
there's a downside, too.

187
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,623
Now somebody else is going to have to make
the meals around here.

188
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:10,728
Oh man. Sedgwick volunteered to make his
world famous lasagna for lunch, but I think

189
00:12:10,728 --> 00:12:13,264
it got to be world famous by everybody
warning their friends about it.

190
00:12:14,465 --> 00:12:16,968
Don't forget. Mount Vesuvius is world famous
as well.

191
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:20,171
Actually, when you eat the lasagna, you
start behaving like Mount Vesuvius.

192
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:23,474
It's at the point now, or we almost want to
get back here.

193
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:26,978
But Douglas has insulted him to the point
that he's really teed off.

194
00:12:26,978 --> 00:12:30,314
He's sitting up in a tree throwing pine
cones at anybody who comes near him.

195
00:12:30,681 --> 00:12:34,218
You know, I'll go read. All great chefs are
very touchy about their cuisine.

196
00:12:34,218 --> 00:12:35,620
I mean, Eddie's an artist.

197
00:12:35,653 --> 00:12:37,521
I mean, his palate is our palates.

198
00:12:38,122 --> 00:12:41,926
Oh, we don't want a double palate the way
you know.

199
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:43,194
You know what, though? You know what?

200
00:12:43,427 --> 00:12:46,230
I don't blame Eddie, because to him, a
dinner table is

201
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,798
Like a blank canvas.

202
00:12:48,265 --> 00:12:49,767
Yeah, and he paints it with oil.

203
00:12:51,002 --> 00:12:55,206
And again, I still do not blame Eddie, you
know, because you've never had to survive 12

204
00:12:55,206 --> 00:12:56,140
months of pork.

205
00:12:56,774 --> 00:12:58,242
Well, you never met my grade five teacher,
Harold.

206
00:13:00,244 --> 00:13:03,781
Anyway, I think I'll just take a stroll down
to Murray Store and see if I can get this

207
00:13:03,781 --> 00:13:05,416
Food Club deal kind of straightened out.

208
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,318
Harold, do that thing that irritates
everybody.

209
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:08,519
Oh OK.

210
00:13:09,053 --> 00:13:12,156
I am a little teapot short and stout.

211
00:13:12,189 --> 00:13:12,957
Here is,

212
00:13:13,891 --> 00:13:15,092
You know, take us into the next segment.

213
00:13:15,626 --> 00:13:16,193
Oh, that!

214
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,769
I read, are we still on track for the Food
Club?

215
00:13:25,503 --> 00:13:28,572
Yeah. Are we going to make a fortune like
Murray says, we are.

216
00:13:29,673 --> 00:13:31,242
Well, and he's still pretty upset.

217
00:13:31,242 --> 00:13:32,710
You know, he's hiding up a tree.

218
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:36,080
Cryo-em. Hmm. I was hoping you could alter
the plan in some way.

219
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,916
He could get a little more enthused, you
know, because he's starting to upset the

220
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:39,583
squirrels.

221
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:44,121
Well, I've been thinking about that, and I've
decided to expand my menu to give Eddie a

222
00:13:44,121 --> 00:13:46,257
potpourri of Menagerie as to what he can
cook.

223
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:48,325
That's French for choices.

224
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:50,361
Yeah. Like, name your poison.

225
00:13:50,928 --> 00:13:55,199
Don't help me, Duane. Go to the store and
get me a bottle of corn oil and a bottle of

226
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,267
weald amaze.

227
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,437
Ok, now once Eddie sees the number of
choices he has, oh, he'll be changing his

228
00:14:00,437 --> 00:14:03,073
tune. Can't find them.

229
00:14:03,107 --> 00:14:05,142
Oh my.

230
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:07,444
They're right in the middle of the middle
shelf there.

231
00:14:07,444 --> 00:14:09,046
If they were a dog, they'd have bit you.

232
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:10,381
There they are, right there.

233
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:11,649
I just get me that one and that one.

234
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:12,950
All right. Oh, I see them.

235
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,852
I should get a government grant for letting
him work here, huh?

236
00:14:16,053 --> 00:14:21,692
Ok, now this one here is your corn oil and
this is your wheel amines.

237
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:22,960
What does that mean?

238
00:14:22,993 --> 00:14:24,695
That's French for corn oil.

239
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:29,600
It's French corn. It's a completely
different taste, a Beaujolais Nouveau.

240
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:32,536
It's the same bottle, Marie.

241
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,571
They recycled the bottles.

242
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:36,240
You know, the French are very clever.

243
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,574
They're always thinking.

244
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:38,842
Imagine that.

245
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,246
Listen, why don't you give Edie this revised
menu?

246
00:14:42,813 --> 00:14:46,950
Show him. You can select Check In or Palais
or Cucaracha.

247
00:14:47,117 --> 00:14:48,118
That's Mexican chicken.

248
00:14:48,585 --> 00:14:50,220
Oh, so he's not limited in any way.

249
00:14:51,388 --> 00:14:52,489
Well, I'll give it a try.

250
00:14:52,489 --> 00:14:53,123
See you later.

251
00:14:53,157 --> 00:14:56,560
Appreciate it. Do you know any Italian?

252
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,363
Mussolini? That's my favorite car.

253
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:07,704
Well, we thought we'd kind of get back to
nature and make things a little simpler on

254
00:15:07,704 --> 00:15:09,006
our adventure with Bill this week.

255
00:15:09,173 --> 00:15:10,507
Bill's going to show you just how to climb a
tree.

256
00:15:10,874 --> 00:15:18,182
Is that simple? Pick a pick on a tree that
has branches just kind of sticking out so you

257
00:15:18,182 --> 00:15:21,952
can so you can use the branches as more or
less.

258
00:15:22,386 --> 00:15:26,690
Oh, steps like steps on a ladder.

259
00:15:28,725 --> 00:15:33,897
By golly, maybe this wasn't going to be
quite as simple as as we well know.

260
00:15:33,897 --> 00:15:35,065
I think he's going to be all right.

261
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:45,742
It's like, Oh, and so now we're going to
start thinking about all of the other things

262
00:15:45,742 --> 00:15:47,945
you could be doing with your life, you know?

263
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,516
Lying down somewhere like that.

264
00:15:54,151 --> 00:15:56,320
Oh well. Time for Plan B.

265
00:15:56,553 --> 00:16:00,724
We'll get the seesaw on the teeter totter
effect and bill is going to stand on one end.

266
00:16:00,757 --> 00:16:04,261
I'll climb up the ladder and then when I
jump down onto that in that end of the down

267
00:16:04,261 --> 00:16:08,565
and his end will go up and he'll get up the
tree, that way is never lost for ideas.

268
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:13,570
Bill and I. And one two, are you going to
go, Oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh.

269
00:16:14,871 --> 00:16:20,344
Oh, not quite as successful as we planned,
but.

270
00:16:22,045 --> 00:16:23,113
All right, all right. All right.

271
00:16:23,146 --> 00:16:25,816
All right. Clancy, I can smell it.

272
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:32,723
Oh okay, Bill, now we got what you call the
golf shoes, the golf shoes with your flange,

273
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:36,159
Netflix and so on. And I got the spikes in
the bottom and what bill is going to do.

274
00:16:36,193 --> 00:16:37,527
I've never seen this done before.

275
00:16:38,061 --> 00:16:43,533
He's going to try and just dig those into
the tree and just climb right up just by

276
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:52,509
Golly. By Golly, he's got something here and
he's getting up there now, 20 30 feet up.

277
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:59,216
And I I don't I don't quite understand that
something about the Earth's rotation and then

278
00:16:59,816 --> 00:17:01,718
something to do with helium in his
snowmobile.

279
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:05,489
Oh, bill, I to go.

280
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,492
Right on the plane, right on the foot.

281
00:17:09,226 --> 00:17:13,897
Thank you, Bill. You know, Harold, you're
getting to that point in your life where you

282
00:17:13,897 --> 00:17:16,199
should start thinking about what you're
going to do for a living, you know?

283
00:17:17,134 --> 00:17:21,037
What do you mean? Well, I'll think about
what you're going to do.

284
00:17:21,071 --> 00:17:23,106
You know, as a career what you can do the
rest of your life.

285
00:17:23,106 --> 00:17:23,940
That's what I'm talking about.

286
00:17:24,474 --> 00:17:29,045
Well, Uncle Red, I thought I might stay on,
you know, the the director producer of the

287
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:30,714
Red Green Show, you know?

288
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,783
I mean, I've been doing for for quite a
while now, and I'm really getting the hang of

289
00:17:33,783 --> 00:17:37,454
it, you know, and and I know I want to stay
with the show and I know you want me to stay

290
00:17:37,454 --> 00:17:39,689
with the show. Right, right, right.

291
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:40,957
I assume, right?

292
00:17:42,158 --> 00:17:43,860
Oh, golly. Oh, Harold.

293
00:17:44,561 --> 00:17:47,831
It's a bit of a shock. Well, go sure, you're
kidding around.

294
00:17:47,864 --> 00:17:50,967
I'm kind of I'm talking, seriously, what are
you seriously going to do for a living?

295
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:52,435
What do you think? I'm serious.

296
00:17:52,469 --> 00:17:53,603
I'm going to do the show.

297
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,505
No, no, no, no, no.

298
00:17:55,572 --> 00:17:56,740
Come on. But good, Josh.

299
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,040
I'm here.

300
00:17:57,173 --> 00:17:58,475
I'm not dodging. I want to do the show.

301
00:17:58,842 --> 00:18:02,812
I mean, I know look, I like to kid around,
you know, and I know what you do.

302
00:18:02,979 --> 00:18:04,147
I don't want to get around with this.

303
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:05,815
I'm not kidding. I want to do the show.

304
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:07,317
I want to be straight. I'm straight.

305
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,451
Let's be straight. I'm straight,

306
00:18:09,753 --> 00:18:10,954
Man. I want to do the show.

307
00:18:11,254 --> 00:18:12,222
No, come on. I quit quick.

308
00:18:13,256 --> 00:18:14,991
I got it. I want to do the show.

309
00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:16,293
Come on. I want to do a show.

310
00:18:21,598 --> 00:18:21,931
So.

311
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,411
Well, I took Murray's new menu options over
to show Eddie, and he got so darn upset, he

312
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:35,545
almost fell out of his tree.

313
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,647
I don't know. I didn't get so upset about
everything.

314
00:18:37,981 --> 00:18:41,851
You know, you can't tell him that he's fat
or he's bald, or he's a crappy actor, you

315
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:42,919
know, and it's food thing.

316
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:45,155
I mean, what's the big deal? It's not a
matter of life or death.

317
00:18:45,655 --> 00:18:49,893
Actually, dinner tonight came close and I
tried to save a little money by making a

318
00:18:49,893 --> 00:18:51,428
relish and tuna casserole.

319
00:18:51,928 --> 00:18:54,931
He said it had been in his family for
generations, but I think he meant the tuna.

320
00:18:55,665 --> 00:18:56,900
That stuff was deadly.

321
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:58,168
Did you eat that stuff, Harold?

322
00:18:58,168 --> 00:18:59,669
No, but some dropped on my shoe,

323
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:04,941
Ended up with a conga line of guys giving
each other the Heimlich maneuver, and the

324
00:19:04,941 --> 00:19:06,643
potato salad was actually even worse.

325
00:19:07,076 --> 00:19:08,344
That was Jell-O,

326
00:19:09,112 --> 00:19:10,847
Yellow, white, yellow, Harold.

327
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,316
Yes. We ran out of water, so I used sour
cream.

328
00:19:15,218 --> 00:19:17,720
Well, obviously we got to do something about
this meal situation.

329
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,125
We've got to do it soon. Oh, somebody had
seconds

330
00:19:23,293 --> 00:19:24,494
To call the while possible.

331
00:19:24,527 --> 00:19:26,563
That means that the meeting is about to
begin Uncle Red.

332
00:19:26,663 --> 00:19:28,364
Come on, let's get down there and see what's
going on.

333
00:19:29,732 --> 00:19:32,035
Well, I hope we get this thing resolved real
fast.

334
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,237
Man does not live by beer alone.

335
00:19:40,577 --> 00:19:42,845
All right.

336
00:19:48,484 --> 00:19:53,122
They look good. Ok, cool.

337
00:19:53,189 --> 00:19:54,390
All right. All right. All right.

338
00:19:55,024 --> 00:19:59,829
Oh, all right.

339
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:12,642
Well, I'm glad to see that Eddie has left his
branch office floor, recognizes Douglas

340
00:20:12,642 --> 00:20:13,042
Hendricks.

341
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:20,983
Thank you. Read fellow possums thanks to the
incredible savings from Murray's Food Club.

342
00:20:21,184 --> 00:20:24,587
I'm pleased to announce the financial crisis
is over.

343
00:20:27,623 --> 00:20:32,862
Unfortunately, that hasn't stopped one of
the large members from sabotaging the food,

344
00:20:33,096 --> 00:20:35,031
as was the case with tonight's tuna
casserole.

345
00:20:35,832 --> 00:20:38,301
I'm not naming any names.

346
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:45,775
Well, Duane and I certainly appreciate all
your business and not only because you are

347
00:20:45,775 --> 00:20:49,345
fellow lodge members, but because you are
our friends, you're here.

348
00:20:49,345 --> 00:20:53,149
And if it weren't for that fact, well, we
might be tempted to overcharge on all your

349
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:55,585
purchases. Yeah, we sure do.

350
00:20:56,652 --> 00:21:02,959
Well, the Food Club may sound like a good
idea, but tell me, where are you going to

351
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:06,028
store a year's supply of frozen pork?

352
00:21:06,596 --> 00:21:06,696
Oh.

353
00:21:09,198 --> 00:21:12,034
Requires absolutely no refrigeration.

354
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:17,740
News Feed the pigs and clean the pens.

355
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:21,511
The food is still alive

356
00:21:21,878 --> 00:21:27,516
On the hoof. Well, I told you of fresh costs,
more work.

357
00:21:27,783 --> 00:21:30,820
Well, we can't have one hundred more pigs
running around this lodge.

358
00:21:33,222 --> 00:21:35,758
Wait a minute, you're better off, including
me in that group.

359
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:38,160
I'm rather fastidious, actually, about my
personal hygiene.

360
00:21:38,461 --> 00:21:38,928
All righty.

361
00:21:39,996 --> 00:21:43,766
Well, in light of this new information,
fellow opossums, I suggest we resign from

362
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:45,334
this food club immediately.

363
00:21:48,838 --> 00:21:50,406
Back to the way things work.

364
00:21:51,374 --> 00:21:52,742
You won't have a cook.

365
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:55,478
Fine, I'll cook.

366
00:21:56,312 --> 00:21:57,880
I made these cookies for dessert.

367
00:21:57,913 --> 00:22:00,182
And no one sabotage them.

368
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,284
The when they're quite good, actually.

369
00:22:02,551 --> 00:22:04,620
Good job.

370
00:22:05,321 --> 00:22:06,889
There's plenty more where these came from.

371
00:22:07,923 --> 00:22:08,858
Go ahead. Dig in.

372
00:22:12,328 --> 00:22:15,431
These are butter. No, no, no.

373
00:22:15,431 --> 00:22:17,099
Wait, no stop. Stop. Sorry, I'm sorry.

374
00:22:17,266 --> 00:22:22,872
I can't possibly let you eat these cookies
by amateurs is dangerous.

375
00:22:22,905 --> 00:22:24,140
It could kill you now.

376
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:27,977
No, no, no, no, no. That's it.

377
00:22:27,977 --> 00:22:29,278
That's it. It's settled.

378
00:22:29,578 --> 00:22:31,180
I'm back as the Lord Chef.

379
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:37,286
You need me. Unscathed.

380
00:22:39,989 --> 00:22:41,490
Watch yourself there, Meryl. Thanks so much.

381
00:22:42,425 --> 00:22:45,060
I'll be back as our cook, we're going to be
able to lose weight anyway.

382
00:22:45,127 --> 00:22:47,730
Yeah, you don't know this bill.

383
00:22:47,863 --> 00:22:51,433
Oh, well, I call on Mary and Duane here to
give us a little bit of magic for the

384
00:22:51,433 --> 00:22:52,001
entertainment.

385
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:58,207
All right, ladies and gentlemen, if you will
notice there is nothing up my sleeve.

386
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,341
Duane looking.

387
00:23:03,412 --> 00:23:05,247
Wow. All's well that ends.

388
00:23:06,115 --> 00:23:09,752
Nobody's real satisfied with the way things
turned out, but on the other hand, nobody's

389
00:23:09,752 --> 00:23:11,353
angry enough to do anything except complain.

390
00:23:11,387 --> 00:23:12,821
That's about as close as we get to a happy
ending.

391
00:23:13,989 --> 00:23:17,459
Anyway, if my wife is watching, I'll be
coming straight home after the meeting and I

392
00:23:17,459 --> 00:23:18,961
am a little hungry, so I would appreciate
it.

393
00:23:19,028 --> 00:23:22,898
If you didn't put the time lock on the
fridge tonight, I promise I'll go back on the

394
00:23:22,898 --> 00:23:28,537
diet next year. Until next time, on behalf
of myself and Harold and the whole gang up

395
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:30,472
here at Possum Lodge. Keep your stick on the
ice.

396
00:23:36,178 --> 00:23:38,681
Another match, ladies and gentlemen, is it's
simple two.

397
00:23:38,747 --> 00:23:39,882
Yes, it's very simple.

398
00:23:39,915 --> 00:23:46,322
Here we go. The hope to be on fire soon,
right here, you.

399
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,892
Abracadabra. Alec Booze.
