1
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:05,772
REMEMBER THESE THINGS, HUH?

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,741
THE PAPER SHEARER.

3
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:09,909
TEACHER USED TO GET ME TO
TRIM ALL HER TEST PAPERS

4
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:12,645
WHILE THE OTHER KIDS
LEARNED STUFF.

5
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,280
I ALWAYS TOOK
THAT AS A COMPLIMENT.

6
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:17,017
I DIDN'T REALIZE
SHE'D GIVEN UP ON ME.

7
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,285
BUT IF YOU EVER SEE
ONE OF THESE FOR SALE

8
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:21,588
AT MAYBE A YARD SALE OR ART
AUCTION OR ANYTHING,

9
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:24,624
YOU PICK IT UP,
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

10
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,127
SOMEWHERE A MAN
IS GOING HUNGRY,

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,897
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE HE
FINDS HIMSELF ALONE IN
A STRANGE PLACE...

12
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,632
THE KITCHEN.

13
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:35,568
AND IN HIS CONFUSION,
HE CAN'T SEPARATE

14
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:37,604
THE PRECIOUS,
LIFE-GIVING HOT DOG

15
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,139
FROM ITS FROZEN BROTHERS.

16
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:40,974
WELL, NO MORE.

17
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,248
AND FOR DESSERT.

18
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:58,758
[cheers and applause]

19
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,566
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

20
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,700
APPRECIATE THAT.

21
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,668
THANK YOU.

22
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,437
WELL, BIG NEWS AT THE
LODGE THIS WEEK.

23
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:12,138
ACTUALLY, POSSUM LODGE
HAS BEEN SINGLED OUT

24
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,741
FOR RECOGNITION BY
THE LOCAL TOWN COUNSEL.

25
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:18,178
APPARENTLY WE ARE THE NUMBER
ONE SOURCE OF AIR POLLUTION

26
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,047
IN THE ENTIRE
POSSUM LAKE AREA.

27
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,616
AND THEY GOT THE SATELLITE
PICTURES TO PROVE IT.

28
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:28,221
WE'RE NUMBER ONE.
WE'RE NUMBER ONE.

29
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,923
UNCLE RED.
UNCLE RED.

30
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:32,792
I GOT A SOLUTION TO
THE POLLUTION PROBLEM.

31
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:36,196
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF
THE KYOTO PROTOCOL?

32
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:39,232
IS THAT LIKE
THE HONDA ACCORD?

33
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,501
NO, NO, THE KYOTO PROTOCOL
IS AN INTERNATIONAL
AGREEMENT

34
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,536
TO CUT GREENHOUSE
GAS EMISSIONS.

35
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,606
WHY WOULD I CARE, HAROLD?
I DON'T HAVE A GREENHOUSE.

36
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,341
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.

37
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,076
THEY'RE CREATED BY
BURNING FOSSIL FUELS.

38
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,212
YOU KNOW, LIKE LAWN MOWERS
AND OUTBOARD MOTORS

39
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:55,148
AND LEAF BLOWERS
AND SNOW BLOWERS
AND POSSUM VANS.

40
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:56,249
ANYTHING THAT BURNS GAS.

41
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,984
I'M NOT SHUTTING OFF
THE POSSUM VAN

42
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,854
WHEN IT TAKES ME 45
MINUTES TO GET
IT STARTED.

43
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,489
YEAH, I KNOW,
BUT HERE'S THE GOOD PART.

44
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:05,625
WITH THE KYOTO AGREEMENT,
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO TRADE OFF.

45
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:09,229
SO WHAT YOU DO, IF YOU HAVE
A LOT OF POLLUTION
IN ONE AREA,

46
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:14,334
YOU CAN BALANCE THAT
BY CUTTING POLLUTION
IN ANOTHER AREA.

47
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:17,604
AND NEXT TO THE LODGE,
YOU KNOW WHO THE BIGGEST
POLLUTER IS?

48
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,939
GOT TO BE
STINKY PETERSON.

49
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,774
NO. NO. NO,
IT'S NOT.

50
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,676
IT'S THAT COAL BURNING
ELECTRICAL GENERATING
STATION

51
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,311
UP AT PORT ASBESTOS.

52
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:29,315
SO YOU KNOW HOW WE'RE
GOING TO SATISFY THE
KYOTO PROTOCOL?

53
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,755
WE PLEAD INSANITY?

54
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:38,758
NO! NO! WE'RE GOING
TO MAKE A WINDMILL.

55
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,493
WE'RE GOING TO GENERATE
OUR OWN POWER.

56
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,195
AND IF WE BUILD
IT BIG ENOUGH,

57
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,830
WE CAN GENERATE ENOUGH
POWER FOR THE WHOLE TOWN.

58
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,865
YOU MEAN TO SAY WE'D
GET FREE POWER

59
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,334
AND BE ABLE TO SELL POWER
TO THE REST OF THE TOWN

60
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,537
AND BE ABLE TO MAKE
SOMETHING HUGE
AND DANGEROUS

61
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,704
ALL AT
THE SAME TIME?

62
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:52,972
YEAH!

63
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,641
WELL, I THINK YOU'VE
REALLY DONE IT THIS
TIME, HAROLD.

64
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,309
WELL, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

65
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,112
YOU MAY TURN INTO
A MAN YET.

66
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:01,181
DON'T SPOIL IT.

67
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:12,192
IT'S TIME FOR THE
POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

68
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,928
[cheers and applause]

69
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,967
TONIGHT'S WINNER
RECEIVES THIS COUPON

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,803
FOR TWO TICKETS
TO THE POSSUM LAKE
LITTLE THEATRE PRODUCTION OF

71
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,906
"THE BEST LITTLE
WAREHOUSE IN TEXAS."

72
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:30,977
IT'S THE STORY OF A WOMAN
AND HER RISE TO THE TOP,

73
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,581
AND THE FORKLIFT OPERATOR
WHO TRIED TO PUT HER THERE.

74
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,883
ALL RIGHT, COVER
YOUR EARS, ED.

75
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,585
OKAY, RED, YOU'VE GOT
30 SECONDS

76
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,420
TO GET ED FRID TO SAY
THIS WORD...

77
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:44,824
YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
WINSTON.

78
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,292
AND... GO!

79
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,161
OKAY, ED,
IF YOU GET A CALL

80
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,496
TO CAPTURE A FEROCIOUS
BEAR THAT'S ON THE LOOSE

81
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,131
THE FIRST THING YOU
HAVE TO DO IS...

82
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,400
GIVE IT A REALLY
BIG HEAD START.

83
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,270
NO. OKAY.
NO. NO. NO. NO.

84
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,772
THIS IS A WORD
THAT STANDS FOR

85
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,708
WHAT THE BEAR LEAVES
BEHIND ON THE GROUND.

86
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:04,043
I'M NOT SAYING THAT
WORD ON TELEVISION.

87
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,380
ED, I'M TALKING
ABOUT THE PAWS.

88
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,282
OH, LONG.

89
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,751
YEAH, THE BEAR TAKES
QUITE A LONG PAUSE

90
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,386
TO MAKE A
PILE THAT BIG.

91
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,388
NO. NO. NO.

92
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:16,990
ALMOST OUT OF TIME,
HERE, RED.

93
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,626
OKAY, ED, THINK
TRAIN --

94
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:20,727
ATTACK.

95
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,395
WHAT?

96
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:25,698
MOST PEOPLE TRAIN
THEIR DOGS TO ATTACK.
TO ATTACK
 ME.

97
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,433
AT LEAST THAT'S BEEN
MY TRACK RECORD.

98
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,769
THERE WE GO.

99
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:38,044
[quirky upbeat music]

100
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,148
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT
PORTION OF THE SHOW.

101
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,083
THIS IS WHERE WE ADDRESS THE
THREE LITTLE WORDS

102
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,551
THAT MEN FIND
SO HARD TO SAY...

103
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,054
audience: I DON'T KNOW. 

104
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,023
THAT'S TRUE,
ISN'T IT?

105
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,025
OKAY, TODAY'S LETTER
GOES AS FOLLOWS...

106
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:55,528
"DEAR EXPERTS --"
â™ª LA-LA-LA-LA! 

107
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,830
"LATELY, MY TEENAGE SON
HAS BEEN HANGING OUT
AT THE MALL,

108
00:04:57,897 --> 00:04:59,932
"SMOKING CIGARETTES
AND SLACKING OFF.

109
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,135
"MY HUSBAND WON'T
DISCIPLINE HIM

110
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,804
"BECAUSE HE DOES
EXACTLY THE SAME THING.

111
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:09,008
"IS THERE SOME WAY I CAN
ECOURAGE MY SON TO BE
A BETTER PERSON?"

112
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,678
WELL, YOU KNOW, TEENAGERS ARE
KIND OF LIKE FIRECRACKERS.

113
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:15,481
YOUR BEST BET IS TO STAND WAY
BACK AND COVER YOUR EYES.

114
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:18,985
NO, NO, NO, THAT'S
JUST IGNORING YOUR
RESPONSIBILITIES.

115
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,154
YES, IT IS.

116
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,291
UNCLE RED, YOU CAN'T
JUST STOP BEING A PARENT.

117
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:28,461
YOU KNOW, I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO AGREE WITH
HAROLD ON THIS POINT,

118
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,164
AND, AS YOU KNOW, IT
HURTS ME DEEPLY
TO SAY THAT.

119
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,535
YOU HAVE TO INVOLVE YOUR
PARENTS IF YOU'RE
A TEENAGER.

120
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,670
LIKE I REMEMBER,
WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER,

121
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,839
IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN SO GREAT

122
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:43,042
TO BE ABLE TO TALK
TO ANY ONE OF MY DADS.

123
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,844
YES. YES, MIKE IS
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

124
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:47,046
YOU HAVE TO KEEP OPEN
THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION.

125
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,282
YES, AND YOU HAVE
TO BE VERY AWARE

126
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:51,050
OF WHO YOUR SON IS
HANGING OUT WITH,

127
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,186
ESPECIALLY HIS GIRLFRIEND.

128
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,888
OH, YOU NEVER HAD THAT
PROBLEM, DID YOU, HAROLD?

129
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,127
MY GIRLFRIENDS WERE
A BAD INFLUENCE ON ME.

130
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,730
I MEAN, MY LIFE WOULD
HAVE BEEN TOTALLY
DIFFERENT

131
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,499
IF I'D DATED NUNS.

132
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,936
SO WOULD THEIRS,
I'M THINKING.

133
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,838
YOU KNOW, I THINK PARENTS
HAVE MORE INFLUENCE

134
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,506
OVER THEIR KIDS
THAN THEY THINK,

135
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,441
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE IF
PARENTS RESPECTED THEIR KIDS

136
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,210
THEN THE KIDS WOULDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO REBEL AGAINST,

137
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,011
OR THEY WOULDN'T BE HANGING
OUT WITH THE WRONG CROWD.

138
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,080
YEAH, YOU SEE,
MY LIFE WENT DOWNHILL

139
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,149
BECAUSE I HUNG OUT WITH THE
WRONG CROWD WHEN I
WAS A TEENAGER.

140
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,318
AND THEN LATER
WHEN I WENT TO PRISON,

141
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,287
MY SOCIAL CIRCLE CONTINUED
TO BE UNINSPIRING.

142
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,825
REALLY?

143
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,028
BUT THAT'S MY POINT.
THAT'S MY POINT, THOUGH.

144
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,630
SEE, NOBODY EVER
GETS ANYWHERE

145
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,365
BY HANGING OUT WITH A
BUNCH OF LOSERS.

146
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,802
OH, YEAH?
IT GOT ME A TELEVISION SHOW.

147
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,307
LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT HAPPENED
TO ME THE OTHER NIGHT.

148
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:51,077
BATTERIES WENT DEAD
IN MY TV REMOTE.

149
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,645
THAT HAPPENS
TO ME A LOT,

150
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,414
ESPECIALLY DURING
THE PLAYOFFS.

151
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,349
BUT WHEN I POPPED
OUT ONE OF THE BATTERIES,

152
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,184
IT FLEW THROUGH THE AIR --

153
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,086
AGAIN, THIS IS JUST
A RE-ENACTMENT --

154
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,355
AND DROPPED RIGHT INTO
A CAN OF ROOT BEER

155
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,157
THAT I WAS FORCING
MYSELF TO DRINK

156
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:05,691
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING
ELSE IN THE FRIDGE.

157
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,528
BUT IMAGINE MY SURPRISE
AT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT.

158
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,799
AND WHEN I TOUCHED THE CAN,
I GOT A SHOCK.

159
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,937
YES, VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT
JUST HAPPENED IN OUR
RE-ENACTMENT.

160
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,972
SO THEN I THOUGHT, HEY,

161
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,641
WHY DON'T I HOOK UP
MY TEST LIGHT

162
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:23,943
AND SEE WHAT
HAPPENS, HUH?

163
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,114
[light buzzing]

164
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,249
WELL, NOW I STARTED TO
GET PRETTY EXCITED --

165
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,718
ESPECIALLY AFTER THE FEELING
CAME BACK INTO MY HAND,

166
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:35,087
BECAUSE I FIGURE I HAVE A
SOURCE OF PRETTY CHEAP ENERGY.

167
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:37,757
AND ALL I NEED IS A
BUNCH OF DEAD BATTERIES.

168
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:43,930
I LOOKED THE WHOLE THING UP IN
THE ENCYCLOPEDIA IDIOTICA,

169
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:46,532
AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS
THE ACID FROM THE POP

170
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,601
WAS ACTING AS
AN ELECTROLYTE,

171
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,870
AND THAT WAS DISSOLVING THE
CHEMICALS IN THE BATTERY,

172
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,805
GENERATING AN
ELECTRICAL CHARGE.

173
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,074
SO TODAY
ON HANDYMAN CORNER,

174
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,243
I'M GOING TO USE
THIS NEW KNOWLEDGE --

175
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,278
IT'S ACCIDENTAL
KNOWLEDGE, REALLY,

176
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,746
AS MOST OF MINE IS --

177
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,683
TO MAKE MYSELF AN
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY
ELECTRIC TRUCK.

178
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,455
OKAY, MY FIRST STEP WAS TO
INSTALL A KIDDIE POOL,
SLIDE AND ALL,

179
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,390
INTO THE BED
OF MY PICKUP.

180
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:13,125
I GOT HER FILLED
UP WITH WATER.

181
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,461
NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS ADD THE ACID.

182
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:18,231
I'M GOING TO GO
WITH VINEGAR --

183
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,600
OR AS WE CALL
IT AROUND HERE,

184
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,569
BUSTER HADFIELD'S
HOME-MADE WINE.

185
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,706
BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT
GOING TO GIVE US ENOUGH JUICE,

186
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:30,076
SO I'M GOING TO THROW
IN A LITTLE CAUSTIC SODA.

187
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,614
THAT'S DRAIN CLEANER
TO YOU AND ME,

188
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,616
TAX WRITE-OFF TO WINSTON.

189
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,051
SO HE'LL NEVER MISS THIS.

190
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,454
[choking and coughing]

191
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:46,492
OKAY, I TOOK THE MOTOR OUT OF
BERNICE'S WASHING MACHINE.

192
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,194
USE THAT AS MY
POWER PLANT.

193
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:50,830
LUCKILY, THE ORIGINAL GAS
ENGINE HAD DROPPED OUT,

194
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:54,133
WHEN I SLAMMED OVER THE
SPEED BUMP OUTSIDE THE
SENIOR'S HOME.

195
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,169
SO ONE OF THESE CABLES
BECOMES MY GROUND WIRE,

196
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,071
AND THE OTHER ONE, HERE,

197
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,877
THAT'S MY LIVE WIRE.

198
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,581
NOW, FOR MY SPEED CONTROL,

199
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,716
I WIRED THE MOTOR
INTO THIS DIMMER SWITCH

200
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,518
OFF THE DINING ROOM
CHANDELIER.

201
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,689
THIS IS THE FUTURE YOU'RE
LOOKING AT RIGHT HERE, FOLKS.

202
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,991
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

203
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,060
THEY SHOULD AT
LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

204
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:32,605
[applause]

205
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,447
[quirky upbeat music]

206
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,752
YOU KNOW, WHENEVER YOU
SEE A MARRIED COUPLE

207
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,221
TELLING A STORY TOGETHER
TO A THIRD PARTY,

208
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,324
THERE'S GOING
TO BE TROUBLE.

209
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,259
NOW, THE ONE PERSON WHO'S
TELLING THE STORY --

210
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,894
USUALLY THE WIFE,

211
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,763
SHE KIND OF BECOMES
LIKE THE PROSECUTOR.

212
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,132
AND THE ONE WHO THE
STORY'S ABOUT --

213
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,101
ALWAYS THE HUSBAND,

214
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:05,538
WELL, NOW, HE BECOMES KIND OF
LIKE THE DEFENCE ATTORNEY.

215
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,841
AND THE LISTENER -- USUALLY A
FRIEND OR A NEIGHBOUR,

216
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:12,278
WELL, THAT PERSON BECOMES
THE JUDGE AND THE JURY.

217
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,848
AND THESE TRIALS
HAVE NO RULES.

218
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,484
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRESENT
EVIDENCE OR PROVIDE WITNESSES

219
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:21,053
OR EVEN TELL THE TRUTH.

220
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,689
I MEAN, THE TWO FAKE
LAWYERS, THEY --

221
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,658
FIRST OF ALL, THEY START
WITH THEIR SUMMATIONS,

222
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:28,294
AND THEN THEY JUST KIND OF
INTERRUPT EACH OTHER
WHENEVER THEY WANT,

223
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:31,030
TRYING TO GET THE JUDGE
TO SEE IF THEIR WAY.

224
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:34,367
AND THE POOR JUDGE'S GOT NO
HARD EVIDENCE TO GO ON,

225
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,837
SO THEY JUST END UP SIDING
WITH WHO EVER THEY
LIKE BETTER.

226
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,705
AND THE FRIENDSHIP
GOES OUT THE --

227
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,407
SO, I TELL YOU WHAT,

228
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,309
WHENEVER YOU AND YOUR WIFE
HAVE A STORY TO TELL,

229
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,145
NEVER TELL IT TOGETHER.

230
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,547
LET HER TELL IT HER WAY
TO HER FRIENDS.

231
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,549
AND YOU TELL IF YOUR WAY
TO YOUR FRIENDS.

232
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,585
NEITHER ONE OF YOU IS
TELLING THE STORY

233
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,186
THE WAY IT ACTUALLY
HAPPENED ANYWAY,

234
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,588
SO IT DOESN'T
REALLY MATTER.

235
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,923
AND IF YOU EVER GET INTO A
SITUATION WHERE BY ACCIDENT

236
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,126
YOU END UP TELLING THE
STORY TOGETHER TO SOMEBODY,

237
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,396
ASK FOR A RECESS,
TAKE YOUR WIFE ASIDE,

238
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,765
SETTLE OUT OF COURT.

239
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,800
REMEMBER,
I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

240
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,669
WE'RE ALL IN
THIS TOGETHER.

241
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:13,039
[applause]

242
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:16,242
WHEN THE AIR AROUND YOUR
PLACE IS SO GREEN IT GLOWS,

243
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:19,178
AND YOUR ONCE FRIENDLY
NEIGHBOURS HAVE ALL
BECOME FOES,

244
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,647
CALL ME AND I'LL BE THERE,
QUICK WITH MY HOSE.

245
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,250
NO NEED FOR DIRECTIONS,
I'LL JUST FOLLOW MY NOSE.

246
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,358
WELL, WE GOT OUR WINDMILL
UP AND RUNNING.

247
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:35,161
AND MOST OF POSSUM LAKE
IS USING OUR POWER.

248
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:38,264
GOOD THING WE HAD
ALL THOSE JUMPER CABLES.

249
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,500
OF COURSE, WHEN YOU SWITCH
FROM COAL TO WIND POWER,

250
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,536
YOU KNOW, YOU GET
THE ODD DIP.

251
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,778
THERE'S NOT MUCH OF
BREEZE TODAY, UNCLE RED.

252
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,081
HAROLD, JUST
RELAX, EH?

253
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,349
NOBODY CAN PUSH US
AROUND ANY MORE.

254
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,085
WANT TO KNOW WHY?

255
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,987
BECAUSE WE'RE THE
ELECTRIC COMPANY NOW.

256
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,523
WE GOT POWER.

257
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,128
WE GOT PROBLEMS.

258
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,297
[phones rings]

259
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,432
HOW COME THE
PHONE STILL WORKS?

260
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,501
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT
THE PHONE COMPANY.

261
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:19,338
HELLO, POSSUM LODGE
POWER COMPANY.

262
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,407
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YA?

263
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:25,244
YEAH, OKAY, DID YOU CHECK
THE FUSE BOX?

264
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,646
WELL, MAYBE YOU'D THINK
ABOUT CHECKING THAT

265
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:30,816
BEFORE YOU JUST AUTOMATICALLY
BLAME THE POWER COMPANY.

266
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,651
YEAH, RIGHT.
YOU HAVE ONE TOO.

267
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:34,286
BYE.

268
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,655
[phone rings]

269
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:41,694
[as recorded message]
YOU HAVE REACHED THE POSSUM
LODGE POWER COMPANY.

270
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:44,764
FOR SERVICE IN ENGLISH,
PLEASE HANG UP.

271
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,032
[laughter and applause]

272
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,070
YEAH?
RED!

273
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,372
THE POWER'S BEEN OUT IN
MY STORE FOR FOUR HOURS!

274
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,107
TRAFFIC LIGHTS ARE OUT.

275
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,776
MY CASH REGISTER
STOPPED WORKING.

276
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:59,512
MOOSE THOMPSON'S STUCK
ON THE ESCALATOR.

277
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,650
YOU CAN'T GET STUCK
ON AN ESCALATOR.

278
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,051
YOU JUST
WALK DOWN.

279
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,920
NOT WHEN YOU'RE
MOOSE THOMPSON.

280
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:11,457
HE'S GOT HIS BUTT WEDGED
BETWEEN THE HANDRAILS.

281
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,560
PLUS, MY FREEZER'S OFF,
SO ALL THE ICE CREAM'S MELTED.

282
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,028
I'M GIVING IT AWAY.

283
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,797
OH, WOW!
EXCELLENT!

284
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,265
I'M GIVING IT AWAY
AT 10% OFF.

285
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,800
I OWE YA.

286
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,368
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE PROBLEM IS?

287
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:23,803
IT'S NOT
THE WINDMILL,

288
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,304
BECAUSE THE MILL
PART WORKS FINE,

289
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,872
AS LONG AS THE
WIND IS GOING.

290
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,440
SEE, THE PROBLEM IS,
AS SOON AS THE
WIND DIES OFF,

291
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:29,775
WE GOT NO POWER.

292
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,811
TAKE IT EASY ON THE
ICE CREAM THERE,
HAROLD.

293
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:33,212
YOU'RE GOING TO GET
YOURSELF A BRAIN FREEZE.

294
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,080
NO, IT'S GOOD.
I LIKE ICE CREAM.
ICE CREAM IS GOOD.

295
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,983
I'VE GOT SOME ICE CREAM,
AND IT'S GOOD, SO I'M
EATING IT.

296
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,653
HEY, I JUST
GOT AN ID ---

297
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,188
IS YOUR CAR HERE,
DALTON?

298
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,123
NO, I WALKED.

299
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:50,462
THAT WAS CLOSE.
I THOUGHT YOU DID.

300
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,097
OKAY, HERE'S
WHAT WE DO...

301
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,966
WE HOOK UP YOUR CAR
AND MY POSSUM VAN

302
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,868
AND ANY OTHER
VEHICLES WE CAN FIND,

303
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,703
WE HOOK THE DRIVE WHEELS
ONTO THE WINDMILL

304
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,171
AND WE GET HER
SPINNING THAT WAY.

305
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:00,139
THAT'S THE WAY WE
GENERATE THE POWER.

306
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:01,807
IS THAT GOOD?
ALL IN FAVOUR SAY AYE.

307
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,375
AYE.
AYE.

308
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,411
[exclaiming in pain]

309
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:09,315
Red [voiceover]:
WE DON'T HAVE A CASINO 
IN THE POSSUM LAKE AREA, 

310
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:12,284
SO SOMETIMES WE JUST COOK UP 
A GAME OF BINGO OURSELVES. 

311
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,154
AND I THOUGHT THE THREE 
OF THEM WERE ALL PLAYING,
 

312
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,657
BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY 
JUST WALTER AND MIKE,
 

313
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,526
BECAUSE DALTON WAS -- 
HE HAD A CROSSWORD.
 

314
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,528
I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS 
A CROSSWORD PUZZLE
 
HE HAD GOING.

315
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,064
I WAS OFFERING 
A PRETTY FANCY PRIZE...
 

316
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,366
A FISHING VEST 
WITH EVERYTHING YOU'D
 
EVER WANT ON IT.

317
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:30,236
AND THE BOYS ARE PRETTY 
EXCITED OVER THAT.
 

318
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,238
AND WE HAD TO MAKE 
EVERYTHING OURSELVES.
 

319
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:35,741
WE HAD A LEAF BLOWER 
BLOWING THE -- 

320
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,711
WE GOT PING-PONG BALLS. 

321
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,946
ANYWAY, THE NUMBER 
COMES DOWN, 

322
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,948
AND IT'S G-53. 

323
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,783
I JUST MARK HER 
ON THE BOARD,
 
 

324
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,452
AND THE BOYS 
CHECK THEIR CARDS -- 

325
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,287
WELL, WALTER AND MIKE 
CHECK THEIR CARDS.
 

326
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,456
DALTON'S STILL WORKING 
ON THE CROSSWORD. 

327
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,291
I GOT ANOTHER 
ONE HERE, B-12.
 

328
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:53,959
AND MARK THAT UP ON THE -- 

329
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,895
IT'S LIKE A 
VITAMIN, THAT ONE. 

330
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,696
AND THEN MIKE DOESN'T 
HAVE ONE, SO HE SEES --
 

331
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,298
SO HE'S GONNA SNEAK -- 
AND WALTER -- 

332
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,901
THEN BANG! 

333
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:04,270
SO NOW OF COURSE THE BINGO 
BALLS ARE EVERYWHERE. 

334
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,939
SO I'VE GOT AN IDEA. 
YOU GUYS GO FIND THE BALLS,
 

335
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,540
AND THEN ANY 
BALL YOU FIND, 

336
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,409
I'LL REGISTER THE NUMBER, 
AND IF YOU GOT THAT NUMBER,
 

337
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,611
THEN YOU -- SO WE CAN 
CARRY ON WITH OUR GAME.
 

338
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,481
THAT WAY I DIDN'T 
HAVE TO DO ANYTHING. 

339
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,017
SO MIKE'S OUT THERE LOOKING, 
AND HE SEES A BINGO BALL.  

340
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,286
AND HE PICKS IT UP, 
AND HE'S ALL EXCITED,
 

341
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,488
UNTIL HE REALIZES 
THAT IT'S NOT A NUMBER  

342
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,757
THAT HE HAS ON ANY 
OF HIS BINGO CARDS.
 

343
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:27,693
BUT THEN HE REMEMBERS 
HE DOES HAVE SOMETHING...
 

344
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,428
A MARKER. 

345
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:34,466
SO I-30 SUDDENLY 
BECOMES N-38. 

346
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,740
SO I MARK THAT 
DOWN ON THE CHART. 

347
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,776
AND THEN WALTER'S 
CARRYING ON THERE.
 

348
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,511
AND HE SEES A BALL, 
AND HE PICKS IT UP,
 

349
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,680
BUT THERE ARE NO -- 
FOR SOME REASON,
 

350
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,415
THE NUMBERS MUST 
HAVE COME OFF --
 

351
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:50,950
I DON'T KNOW WHY 
THERE WOULD BE NO -- 

352
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,953
OH, YEAH, I SEE. 

353
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,721
RIGHT. 

354
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,590
AND DALTON'S STILL WORKING 
ON THE CROSSWORD. 

355
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,926
MEANWHILE, THERE WERE A 
COUPLE OF BALLS STILL
 
FLYING ALONG,

356
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,594
AND THEY ROLLED 
DOWN A HOLE.
 

357
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,029
AND MIKE'S HOT 
ON THE TRAIL.
 

358
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,531
HE'S ALL EXCITED. 

359
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,333
THEN HE'S SOMEWHAT 
LESS EXCITED. 

360
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,170
THAT CAN HAPPEN. 

361
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,905
AND WALTER SAW 
ANOTHER BALL,
 

362
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,740
KIND OF MUD ALL OVER IT. 

363
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,709
AND THEN IT TURNS OUT IT 
WASN'T ACTUALLY A BALL.
 

364
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,477
IT WAS THE TIP 
OF SOMETHING.
 

365
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,245
SOME TYPE OF SIGN. 

366
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,314
"DANGER QUICKSAND." 

367
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,917
THAT'S NOT A 
GOOD SIGN. 

368
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,486
ANYWAY, WE GOT WALTER 
OUT OF THERE.
 

369
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,288
GOT HIM BACK TO THE TABLE. 

370
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:30,990
AND I WAS JUST RECOUNTING 
ON ALL THE NUMBERS,
 

371
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:32,558
GOING THROUGH THEM ALL. 

372
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,326
AND THEY WERE JUST 
CHECKING THEM ALL OFF, 

373
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,028
BUT NOBODY WAS 
GETTING A WINNER.
 

374
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,863
MEANWHILE, AS I SAY, 

375
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,466
DALTON WAS LOOKING FOR 
A FIVE-LETTER WORD 
FOR VICTORY. 

376
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,334
HE'S RUNNING IT 
OVER IN HIS MIND,
 

377
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,236
AND THEN HE COMES 
UP WITH IT...
 

378
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:45,504
B-I-N-G- 

379
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,373
AND HE YELLS OUT, BINGO! 

380
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,775
AND OF COURSE, THESE GUYS 
JUST RIP UP THEIR CARDS.
 

381
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,243
THEY FIGURE THEY'VE LOST. 

382
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:54,613
THEY CRUNCH THEM ALL UP 
AND WALK AWAY IN DISGUST.  

383
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,515
AND THEN DALTON COMES 
OVER TO SHOW ME.
 

384
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:57,850
HE WAS ACTUALLY 
DOING A CROSSWORD, 

385
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,718
SO WHAT I SAY TO HIM IS, 

386
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,854
PLEASE, HELP ME ON 
WITH MY PRIZE.  

387
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:04,690
[applause]

388
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,764
[quirky upbeat music]

389
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,002
YOU KNOW, MY WIFE'S REAL
GOOD ABOUT LETTING ME

390
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,371
HAVE A FEW BUDDIES OVER TO
WATCH THE FOOTBALL GAME

391
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:22,474
OR GO FOR THE INDOOR PIZZA
EATING RECORD OR WHATEVER.
 

392
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,744
SHE ONLY ASKS THAT I
GET THEM TO USE COASTERS.

393
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,713
AND BELIEVE ME,
THESE ARE GUYS

394
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,448
WHO CAN'T AFFORD ANOTHER
STRIKE AGAINST THEM.

395
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,084
SO I TRIED USING SOME
OF THESE THICK COASTERS,

396
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,353
JUST SPREADING
THEM AROUND THE TABLE

397
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,954
IN KIND OF A RANDOM ORDER.

398
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:39,558
THEN THE GUYS KIND OF GET
THEIR GLASS HALF ON, HALF OFF.

399
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,827
NEXT THING YOU KNOW YOU'VE
GOT A TIDAL WAVE OF BEER

400
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,997
COMING OFF THE COFFEE TABLE
AND INTOXICATING THE DOG.

401
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,700
THEN I TRIED A DEAL
WHERE I GLUED MY OLD
IRISH ROVERS ALBUMS

402
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,502
TO THE BOTTOM
OF A FEW GLASSES.

403
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,471
PROBLEM THERE WAS EVERY
TIME THE GUYS TOOK A DRINK,

404
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,206
THEY THOUGHT THEY
WERE GOING BLIND.

405
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,510
THEN I GOT THE IDEA OF
CUTTING THE LIDS OUT
OF TIN CANS,

406
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:01,080
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT TOO BIG,
BUT THEY'RE NICE AND THIN.

407
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:02,815
BUT STILL, I NEEDED
A WAY TO MAKE SURE

408
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:05,317
THAT THEY'RE ALWAYS
UNDER THE GLASSES.

409
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:09,188
SO I GLUED A FRIDGE MAGNET
TO THE INSIDE OF THE BOTTOM.

410
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,258
IDIOT-PROOF --
OR EVEN BETTER,

411
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:15,094
IDIOT-READY.

412
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,066
OH, AND ONE MORE THING...

413
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,502
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WHO
DON'T USE COASTERS

414
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,270
ARE THE SAME KIND OF PEOPLE

415
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:28,040
THAT TEND TO LEAVE STUFF LYING
AROUND WHEN THEY'RE GONE.

416
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,780
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY...

417
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,049
THE BEST IDEAS ARE THE ONES
THAT PAY FOR THEMSELVES.

418
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,224
OKAY, WE'RE ALMOST SET

419
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,726
TO FIRE UP OUR
MOTORIZED WINDMILL.

420
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,095
WE'VE GOT ABOUT SEVEN
VEHICLES POWERING THE UNIT.

421
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,064
WE HAD TO LAY A COUPLE OF
THE S.U.V.'S ON THEIR SIDES,

422
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,399
BUT THEY'RE USED TO THAT.

423
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,602
NOW, HAROLD INSISTED

424
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:59,138
THAT WE HOOK ALL THE ENGINES
UP TO THIS REMOTE STARTER.

425
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,206
THAT WAY NOBODY HAS TO
STAND TOO CLOSE,

426
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,642

IN AS A WITNESS LATER.

THE FIRST PLACE.

OH, ARE WE GETTING
GASOLINE FOR FREE TOO?

439

HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
