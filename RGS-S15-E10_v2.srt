00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,039
For those of you who
went to private school,

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:08,541
this is called
an exhaust manifold.

3
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:10,110
This is called a wrench.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,579
And what I'm doing
here is called work.

5
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:14,581
See, I'm trying to increase
the horsepower of this engine

6
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,883
and the best way to do that
is to allow the exhaust

7
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:19,352
to flow more easily
out of the engine.

8
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:20,987
Regardless of what
your grandfather said,

9
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:24,224
exhaust flowing more
easily is no joke.

10
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,192
See, the problem is the
exhaust from each cylinder

11
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,228
gets funneled into
this bottleneck,

12
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,430
which restricts the flow.

13
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,666
You older guys know
what I'm talking about.

14
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,568
Now, a lot of guys
go with bigger pipes,

15
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:38,104
maybe even use one
for each cylinder.

16
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:39,806
These are called headers.

17
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:42,208
Not like the header you took
down the basement stairs...

18
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,544
nobody laughs
at these ones.

19
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:47,680
But I'm thinking,
if size matters...

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,048
why stop at pipes?

21
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:51,050
Why not go up to something
that's way bigger

22
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,353
and used to
handling hot gases?

23
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:55,221
No, not your grandfather.

in your lifetime.

27
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,770
That's what happens when you
get all your ducts in a row.

And talk about performance,

29
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,479

horsepower by around
35,000 BTUs.

00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:12,431
DALTON:
I like being held back.

160
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:16,635
Well, you're the past,
I'm the future.

161
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:19,171
No wonder I find it
so hard to get up
in the morning.

162

You don't get
it do you?

163

This book predicts
that science will
create a computer

164
00:07:22,474 --> 00:07:25,210
that thinks faster
and clearer than man.

165

No, get out of here.
Come on.

166
00:07:30,315 --> 00:07:31,783
Yes, yes it is!

167
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:33,919
We're on the cutting edge
of a brave new world.

168
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,321
DALTON: If computers
are so smart,

169

discovered the cure
for the common cold?

170

RED:
That's a good question.

171

No, that doesn't
even make sense.

172
00:07:44,262 --> 00:07:46,732
That's like saying well
because a balloon holds air,

173
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:50,435
how come we can't turn right
on a red light in Quebec?

174
00:07:50,435 --> 00:07:51,970
Okay, all right.

175
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,939
I don't know what
I was thinking.

176
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:56,074
Obviously, artificial
intelligence is no match

177
00:07:56,074 --> 00:07:58,343
for natural stupidity.

178
00:07:58,343 --> 00:08:00,946
'Cause there is no way a
computer is ever going

179

to be able to tell

180
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:07,552
RED: That's right.
That's our wives' job.

181
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:12,524
I've never
been in a war,

182
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:14,793
which is probably why
we've always won,

183
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:16,995
but I sure like the
military equipment.

184
00:08:16,995 --> 00:08:20,532
Like these cannons on wheels
that you roll up to the target

185
00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:23,869
and then aim and then blow
something to smithereens.

186
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:26,638
Kind of like mass
destruction to go.

187
00:08:26,638 --> 00:08:28,540
So today on
Handyman Corner,

188
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,408
we're going to build
a fun home version

189
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:32,377
of that powerful weapon.

190
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:35,113
I'm going to use this piece
of drain pipe as my gun barrel

191
00:08:35,113 --> 00:08:37,215
and instead of
mortar shells

192
00:08:37,215 --> 00:08:39,317
we'll be
firing off muffins.

193
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:42,520
If you're like me, you
probably have a wife

194
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,155
that doesn't
want you to die

195
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:46,091
and you know how
annoying that can be.

196
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:47,759
She's always watching
your weight

197
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,894
and pushing you to exercise
and eat multi-grain muffins

198
00:08:49,894 --> 00:08:51,663
instead of
cream-filled doughnuts

199
00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:55,000
and high-fibre muffins
aren't that easy to hide.

200
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,468
Oh sure, you could
feed them to the dog

201
00:08:56,468 --> 00:08:58,136
but as soon as your
wife sees the backyard,

202
00:08:58,136 --> 00:09:00,572
she'll know what
you've been up to.

203
00:09:00,572 --> 00:09:02,641
The safest method,
as always

204
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:06,011
is to just blow them
to kingdom come.

205
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:09,881
This car is going to be
the mount for my muffin gun.

206
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:11,583
I've just got to take her
down to Flinty's

207
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,385
and get the front
fenders cut off.

208
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:21,192
I needed a sight for my gun
so I just used the hood
ornament.

209
00:09:21,192 --> 00:09:23,795
Some ornaments make better
sights than others,

210
00:09:23,795 --> 00:09:25,597
Lincoln and
Mercedes are good

211
00:09:25,597 --> 00:09:28,099
or you could use one of
those Pontiac Aztecs,

212
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:30,535
the whole car's a sight.

213
00:09:30,535 --> 00:09:32,437
Now, obviously,
to fire the gun

214
00:09:32,437 --> 00:09:33,872
I'm going to use the
master cylinder

215
00:09:33,872 --> 00:09:35,840
from the car's
power brake system.

216
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,842
See, ordinarily when you
stomp on the brake pedal,

217
00:09:37,842 --> 00:09:39,944
this small piston shoots
forward with a lot of juice

218
00:09:39,944 --> 00:09:41,746
and slams on the brakes.

219
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:43,915
So I'm just going to
biggie-size the piston

220
00:09:43,915 --> 00:09:46,184
with a hockey puck.

221
00:09:46,184 --> 00:09:48,520
You can buy these at one of
those specialty shops

222
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,222
like Pucks 'r' Us
or the Puckatorium

223
00:09:51,222 --> 00:09:53,958
or Puck Depot, Puckers
or Just Pucks

224
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,528
or Pucks 'n' Such.

225
00:09:56,528 --> 00:09:59,397
They got a lot cheaper
during the strike.

226
00:09:59,397 --> 00:10:02,167
Now, when I fire off a muffin,
it won't just be a shot,

227
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:05,170
it'll be a slapshot.

228
00:10:06,971 --> 00:10:09,174
Okay, got my gun
mounted on the wheel

229
00:10:09,174 --> 00:10:10,942
so I can adjust the
up and down angle

230
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:13,144
by just edging the
car forward or back

231
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:14,879
and I can adjust the
side to side angle

232
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,481
by just turning
the steering wheel.

233
00:10:16,481 --> 00:10:18,650
Now all I need is my
automatic muffin motor

234
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,518
and I'm good to go.

235

Vermont.

237
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,499
Okay, the trick to
the muffin feeder

238
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:39,170
is to mount the hockey stick/
pushrod/ammo magazine --

239
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:42,807
hey, wait a minute, that's
two minutes for slashing --

240
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:46,177
onto the outside wall
of the other front tire

241
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:48,112
but at a spot
that's 90 degrees

242
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:49,814
from where the
gun is mounted.

That way when one goes
down the other comes up

00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:04,041
You know that and this is why
he shouldn't be in a home

314
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,409
and why would he want
to be in a home anyway?

315
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:06,810
Because he's smart!
What?

316
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,979
He's got friends there.
He'll have a life there.

317
00:14:08,979 --> 00:14:10,981
And if there is a problem
he'll have people to
take care of him.

318
00:14:10,981 --> 00:14:12,750
No, Harold, there's got
to be another way.

319
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,653
Well, you could
take care of him.

320
00:14:15,653 --> 00:14:18,856
You know, if he's that
keen on going, you know...

321
00:14:18,856 --> 00:14:20,824
I don't think
I should interfere.

322
00:14:20,824 --> 00:14:24,261
Well, he can't go now
because you did interfere.

323
00:14:24,261 --> 00:14:26,130
You told them that he was
a sleepwalker, a pyromaniac

324
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,233
and a potential murderer?

325
00:14:29,233 --> 00:14:31,869
I may have oversold it.

326
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:33,737
Uncle Red, you have to go
down to Shady Acres right now

327
00:14:33,737 --> 00:14:35,172
and make this right.

328
00:14:35,172 --> 00:14:36,640
Okay, I'll do it.
I'll do it.

329
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,708
Oh yeah, how?

330
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,144
I'll just tell them I made
a stupid mistake, okay?

331
00:14:40,144 --> 00:14:41,578
Okay, well, I'll
go with you

332
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:45,349
'cause if you're going
to show them you're an
idiot, I got proof.

333

[ APPLAUSE ]

334
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:51,922
Winston and Bill are going
to have a little day
on the beach.

335
00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:55,159
They took some backpacks
and are just going
to enjoy the day.

336
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,794
Bill decided that this
was a good spot

337
00:14:56,794 --> 00:14:58,128
so he dropped --

338
00:14:58,128 --> 00:14:59,496
He took out
some suntan lotion.

339
00:14:59,496 --> 00:15:01,665
It was a high UV that
day and whoa...

340
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:05,869
You know you want to keep
your knife in another bag
I think, Bill.

341
00:15:05,869 --> 00:15:08,906
And Winston
took his Frisbee --
oh, that's unfortunate.

342
00:15:08,906 --> 00:15:11,708
And Bill doesn't have
the sense of humour
he used to have.

343
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,143
He just fires it
and away she goes.

344
00:15:13,143 --> 00:15:15,112
It picked an
updraft or whatever

345
00:15:15,112 --> 00:15:16,880
and goes all the way
across the lake.

346
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,982
And Bill finds that very funny
but Winston's out of Frisbees

347
00:15:18,982 --> 00:15:20,317
says maybe Bill
should go across

348
00:15:20,317 --> 00:15:22,019
but Bill says why should I
bother, I don't care
about a Frisbee.

349
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:23,887
So Winston's thinking you need
something to care about

350
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:25,622
so how about
your backpack?

351
00:15:25,622 --> 00:15:27,991
There we go.

352
00:15:27,991 --> 00:15:32,796
So now he wants Winston to
go across and Winston
says you go

353
00:15:32,796 --> 00:15:35,432
and Winston says why
don't we both go across.

354
00:15:35,432 --> 00:15:37,501
Okay, so Bill
takes off --

355
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:39,403
He's either dancing or
removing his shoes

356
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:40,737
and he got his shoes
and socks off

357
00:15:40,737 --> 00:15:44,174
but the water was just
a little cooler than
what Bill expected.

358
00:15:44,174 --> 00:15:45,943
Nope, got to
rethink that.

359
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:47,311
So then Winston's
got an idea.

360
00:15:47,311 --> 00:15:49,479
He's got something
in his bag.

361
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:52,583
That's a teddy bear,
Winston.

362
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,686
Oh yeah, this is one of
those self-inflating rafts

363
00:15:55,686 --> 00:15:57,754
so you've got to be
careful with those.

364
00:15:57,754 --> 00:15:59,022
You've got to stop it.

365
00:15:59,022 --> 00:16:00,657
When it gets full, Bill,
you've got to stop it.

366
00:16:00,657 --> 00:16:01,725
Bill!
Bill!

367
00:16:04,595 --> 00:16:06,597
Okay, now, here's a
little safety message

368
00:16:06,597 --> 00:16:10,133
for any of you
kids with an axe...

369
00:16:13,737 --> 00:16:16,073
About an hour later,

370
00:16:16,073 --> 00:16:18,809
Winston realized that Bill
was actually making stilts.

371
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:21,612
So he got
Winston up there

372
00:16:21,612 --> 00:16:25,716
and this looks like
trouble to me.

373
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:31,822
Neither of these guys is
too familiar with the
concept of gravity.

374
00:16:34,391 --> 00:16:36,126
So then they decide
maybe a picnic table

375
00:16:36,126 --> 00:16:38,428
will give them
a little more leverage.

376
00:16:38,428 --> 00:16:40,230
Winston needs Bill to
push him off and then

377
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:43,700
Bill loses his balance and ends
up jumping right on Winston.

378
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,969
So now, you've got
a passenger

379
00:16:45,969 --> 00:16:48,271
and they're heading
towards the water.

380
00:16:48,271 --> 00:16:50,540
Winston comes right up
to it and decides

381
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,175
he's going to take
a big step to go in.

382
00:16:52,175 --> 00:16:54,077
He raises then hits
Bill right in the face

383
00:16:54,077 --> 00:16:56,246
and it was unfortunate
the way this happened

384
00:16:56,246 --> 00:16:57,814
and then he was
out of balance

385
00:16:57,814 --> 00:16:59,616
and then Winston
falls right --

386
00:16:59,616 --> 00:17:01,218
Oh...

387
00:17:01,218 --> 00:17:04,020
Boy, he thought it was
a pole vaulting exhibition.

388
00:17:06,923 --> 00:17:08,425
But just when they're
about to give up,

389
00:17:08,425 --> 00:17:10,293
along comes
the park ranger

390
00:17:10,293 --> 00:17:12,295
and wouldn't you know it,
he's got everything in there.

391
00:17:12,295 --> 00:17:13,563
There's the backpack.

392
00:17:13,563 --> 00:17:14,798
There's your Frisbee.

393
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:16,299
There you go, oh!

394
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:18,435
And there's your backpack.

395
00:17:18,435 --> 00:17:20,570
Everybody's happy.

396
00:17:25,308 --> 00:17:27,077
If a man's home
is his castle

397
00:17:27,077 --> 00:17:29,813
then his back yard is
his trophy room.

398
00:17:29,813 --> 00:17:32,816
It's really a shrine
to a lifetime of tinkering.

399
00:17:32,816 --> 00:17:35,552
Unfortunately, your wife
may not see it that way

400
00:17:35,552 --> 00:17:37,521
or any other way.

401
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:40,323
In fact, she doesn't want
to see it at all.

402
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:45,328
As I always say, out
of sight, out of mind

403
00:17:45,328 --> 00:17:48,431
which doesn't mean that
if you need glasses
you're half crazy.

404
00:17:48,431 --> 00:17:52,869
What it does mean that what
your wife doesn't know
won't hurt you.

405
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:56,139
So I mounted my tarp onto
the rim of my basketball hoop.

406
00:17:56,139 --> 00:17:58,308
Got the whole thing mounted
over the barbeque.

407
00:17:58,308 --> 00:18:01,144
Now, all I have to do
is fire up the grill

408
00:18:01,144 --> 00:18:04,814
and we have ourselves our own
disappearing trophy pile.

409
00:18:35,278 --> 00:18:38,248
Now you just tie off
your tether line and voila,

410
00:18:38,248 --> 00:18:41,317
no crap for your wife to
look at in the back yard.

been a misunderstanding
about Old Man Sedgwick,

a little exaggerated,

about him being a

from Shady Acres for life.

I'm banned.

me in there.

in Shady Acres now?

00:21:03,392 --> 00:21:04,961
All rise.

465
00:21:07,063 --> 00:21:09,465
Quando omni flunkus moritati.

466
00:21:09,465 --> 00:21:10,867
Sit down.

467
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:14,337
All right, bow your heads
for the man's prayer.

468
00:21:14,337 --> 00:21:15,738
I'm a man

469
00:21:15,738 --> 00:21:16,906
but I can change

470
00:21:16,906 --> 00:21:18,074
if I have to

471
00:21:18,074 --> 00:21:19,575
I guess.

472
00:21:19,575 --> 00:21:21,744
All right men, as you know
Old Man Sedgwick

473
00:21:21,744 --> 00:21:24,614
is now living at the
Shady Acres Rest Home

474
00:21:24,614 --> 00:21:26,148
and he wanted
me to tell you

475
00:21:26,148 --> 00:21:28,351
that he appreciates you guys
coming over and visiting.

476
00:21:28,351 --> 00:21:31,587
But he's starting to notice
it's always at mealtime

477
00:21:31,587 --> 00:21:33,689
and the cleaning staff

478
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:36,959
sent back the gift
basket of prunes

479
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:39,462
because they
said his bed

480
00:21:39,462 --> 00:21:42,198
is just too far
from the restroom.
