IF YOU DO AN ANTHROPOLOGICAL
STUDY OF CIVILIZATIONS
THROUGH HISTORY,

2
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:08,041
YOU WILL FIND
THAT MEN HISTORICALLY
HAVE FIVE BASIC NEEDS:

3
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:11,878
FOOD, SHELTER, CLOTHING,
SEX AND ALCOHOLIC
BEVERAGES,

4
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:14,914
AND SOMETIMES THOSE
LAST TWO ARE REVERSED.

5
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:16,883
ALCOHOL IS VERY CEREMONIAL,

6
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:18,351
FOR TOASTING
AT DINNER PARTIES,

7
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,519
FOR COMMUNION AT CHURCH,

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,554
THEY EVEN DRINK BOOZE
AT TREATY SIGNINGS.

9
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:23,323
AND WHEN YOU SEE THE KIND
OF MESS THE WORLD IS IN,

10
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,125
IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS
THAT ALCOHOL WAS INVOLVED

11
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,860
SOMEWHERE IN
THE NEGOTIATIONS.

12
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,695
IT JUST SEEMS THAT
WHENEVER YOU GET
MEN TOGETHER,

13
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,096
YOU GET FERMENTATION.

14
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:31,631
IT'S NOT SMART
OR CORRECT,

THIS WEEK,

37
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,040
THE BEER STORE CALLED
UP AND SAID

38
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,374
THAT IF WE WOULD
PAY OUR TAB,

39
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:49,776
THEY COULD RE-PAVE
THE PARKING LOT

ON TO THE IDEA

AROUND HERE.

47
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:02,755

GOING TO BREW OUR
OWN BEER, HAROLD.

WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
START BY BREWING
SMALL AMOUNTS.

54

YEAH, FIVE KIDS IN

GOT SOME CLOTHES

WAS THE YOUNGEST

WAS HAND-ME-DOWNS

I HATED IT.

IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

MAKE IT TOUGH GETTING
A DATE I WOULD THINK.

103

VALUE OF A DOLLAR,
I'LL SAY THAT.

104
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,656
AND THEN OF COURSE
I LEARNED HOW TO SEW.

105
00:04:17,656 --> 00:04:20,426
AND I MARRIED THE GIRL
WHO TAUGHT ME HOW TO SEW.

THIS WEEK WITH THE

120
00:04:57,796 --> 00:04:59,899
I THOUGHT I'D SHOW
YOU HOW TO MAKE A
GREAT ADDITION

121
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,334
TO ANY BAR, WHETHER
THAT BAR BE IN YOUR
FAMILY ROOM,

122
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:04,470
YOUR OFFICE OR
YOUR GOLF CART.

123
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,205
YOU KNOW, TWO THINGS
THAT YOU NEED AT A BAR

124
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,040
IS ICE AND WATER.

125
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,277
WATER FOR MIXING DRINKS
AND ICE TO DROP INTO
PEOPLE'S SHORTS

126
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:14,179
OR INTO THEIR HATS,
DEPENDING ON WHERE
THEIR HANGOVER IS.

127
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:15,948
NOW, YOU CAN BUY ONE
OF THEM FANCY FRIDGES,

128
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,616
GOT THE ICE AND WATER
DISPENSER BUILT RIGHT IN,

129
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:19,618
BUT THOSE BABIES
ARE UP TO 200 BUCKS,

130
00:05:19,618 --> 00:05:22,554
PLUS THEY MAY
NOT FIT INTO THE SAME
SPACE THAT YOU ALREADY GOT.

131
00:05:22,554 --> 00:05:24,757
AND FOR ME I HAVE TO
CLEAN OUT MY FRIDGE

132
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,525
AND TAKE OFF ALL
MY MESSAGES,

133
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:28,861
THE PHONE NUMBERS,
THE MORTGAGE TO MY HOUSE,

134
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,429
MY WILL.

135
00:05:30,429 --> 00:05:32,197
SO INSTEAD OF THAT,
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU

136
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:33,799
HOW YOU CAN TURN
THE FRIDGE YOU GOT NOW

137
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:35,934
INTO AN ICE AND WATER
DISPENSER MACHINE.

138
00:05:35,934 --> 00:05:37,870
ALL RIGHT, FIRST THING
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
FOR ICE WATER

139
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:43,008
IS SOMETHING
FOR THE COLD
WATER TO FLOW THROUGH.

140
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:44,576
I'M THINKING GARDEN HOSE.

141
00:05:44,576 --> 00:05:47,112
WHAT'S COLD ABOUT A
GARDEN HOSE YOU'RE SAYING

142
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:48,547
AS REACH FOR THE
CHANNEL CHANGER?

143
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:52,184
WELL NOTHING, UNTIL
YOU RUN IT THROUGH
THE FREEZER.

144
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:53,552
ALL RIGHT.

145
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:56,688
STEP ONE, DRILL A THREE
QUARTER INCH HOLE RIGHT
IN THE FREEZER

146
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:58,957
FOR THE HOSE
TO GO THROUGH.

147
00:06:02,394 --> 00:06:04,363
PERFECT.

148
00:06:05,864 --> 00:06:08,267
ALL RIGHT.
I DID THE SAME THING
IN THE BACK END THERE,

149
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,969
SO WE GOT THE GARDEN HOSE
GOING RIGHT THROUGH
THE FREEZER.

150
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:12,805
NOW, YOU'RE GOING
TO WANT TO CONTROL
THE FLOW

151
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,273
AND DIRECTION
OF YOUR ICE WATER,

152
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:15,841
SO I WOULD SAY PUT A
NOZZLE ON THERE LIKE THAT

153
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:17,943
OR IF YOU'RE
A REAL FUN GUY,

154
00:06:17,943 --> 00:06:19,211
YOU CAN THROW A
SPRINKLER ON THERE,

155
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:20,712
YOU KNOW IF YOUR PARTY
GUESTS ARE GETTING
OUT OF HAND,

156
00:06:20,712 --> 00:06:23,148
LIKE MAYBE THEY WANT
TO PLAY CHARADES
OR SOMETHING.

157
00:06:23,148 --> 00:06:26,485
ALL RIGHT, LET'S
GIVE HER A TRY.

158
00:06:30,989 --> 00:06:32,658
THAT'S ODD.

159
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,426
OH MY GOSH.

160
00:06:34,426 --> 00:06:35,928
ALL RIGHT,
THERE'S THE PROBLEM,

161
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,696
SHE'S FROZEN
UP SOLID THERE.

162
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:39,431
SO WHAT WE GOT TO DO
IS WE GOT TO PUT
SOME INSULATION

163
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:42,000
I GUESS AROUND THAT
HOSE TO STOP IT FROM
FREEZING INSIDE THERE.

164
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,002
YOU COULD USE
STYROFOAM OR FIBERGLASS,

165
00:06:44,002 --> 00:06:48,140
BUT I'M THINKING
WORK SOCKS.

166
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,241
ALL RIGHT.

167
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:50,776
LUCKILY I HAD
HOLES IN THE TOES

168
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:52,844
SO THEY JUST THREAD
RIGHT ON THERE.

169
00:06:52,844 --> 00:06:55,847
NOW TO MAKE THE
ICE MAKER PART OF OUR
REFRIGERATOR RENOVATION,

170
00:06:55,847 --> 00:06:58,383
YOU'RE GOING TO
NEED AN ICE CUBE TRAY

171
00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:00,585
AND A CUPBOARD
DOOR HANDLE.

172
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:01,987
SO WHILE YOU GO
AND GET THOSE,

173
00:07:01,987 --> 00:07:04,289
LET'S GET BACK TO
THE SHOW FOR A
FEW MINUTES.

174
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:07,492
MAN MY FEET ARE FREEZING.

175
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:09,428
Red Green:
COMING UP, WE GOT
RANGER GORD COMING DOWN

176
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:10,829
AND HAROLD IS
GOING TO TEACH ME

177
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:13,098
THE POLITICALLY CORRECT
WAY TO INVITE PEOPLE OVER.

178
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:16,234
LIKE THAT'S IMPORTANT.

179
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:20,272
TINY SHOOTS,
BY ME.

180
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:22,107
TINY SHOOTS COME
OUT OF THE GROUND.

181
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:24,209
CROCUS AND TULIPS
AND DAFFODILS RISE

182
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:28,146
TO A HEIGHT OF
TWO AND A HALF INCHES
AND ARE FROZEN IN TIME,

183
00:07:28,146 --> 00:07:29,681
NOT BY A LATE FROST,

184
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:32,117
BUT BY AN
EARLY LAWN MOWER.

185
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:39,224
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE DID WRONG

186
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:40,826
BUT OUR FIRST BATCH
OF HOMEMADE BEER

187
00:07:40,826 --> 00:07:43,228
DID NOT TASTE
ALL THAT GREAT.

188
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:45,497
WELL, UNCLE RED,
DID YOU LIKE BOIL
AND STERILIZE

189
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:47,499
ALL THE BEER VATS
AND BEER BOTTLES?

190
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:49,267
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

191
00:07:49,267 --> 00:07:50,502
WELL, YOU GOT TO
BOIL EVERYTHING

192
00:07:50,502 --> 00:07:52,804
AND MAKE SURE ALL
THE GERMS HAVE
BEEN REMOVED.

193
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:55,807
WE WIPED THEM
ON OUR SHIRTS,
OUR SHIRTS ARE CLEAN.

194
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:59,311
I MEAN, YOU GOT TO MAKE
SURE THE CANISTER ARE
PERFECTLY STERILE.

195
00:07:59,311 --> 00:08:03,782
HAROLD, THE ONLY
THING PERFECTLY STERILE
UP HERE IS OLD MAN SEDGWICK.

196
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:08,153
BESIDES, HOW CAN
YOU BOIL A HOT TUB?

197
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:09,754
OKAY, BUT YOU
KNOW WHAT HAPPENS

198
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:11,389
IF YOU GET ANY ONE
OF THOSE UNWANTED, NASTY,

199
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:13,625
LITTLE GERMS AND BACTERIA.

200
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,294
YEAH, THEY END UP
PRODUCING YOUR SHOW.

201
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:19,998
VERY SELDOM THAT
PEOPLE LIKE US

202
00:08:19,998 --> 00:08:22,400
GET A CHANCE TO
DO A TELEVISION SHOW

203
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,236
AND WELL THANK YOU.

204
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:27,472
RANGER GORD?

205
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:29,241
WELL, WE'RE UP
HERE AT FIRE TOWER 13

206
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:31,009
BUT RANGER GORD IS
OBVIOUSLY NOT AROUND,

207
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:32,744
SO LET'S GO HAROLD.

208
00:08:32,744 --> 00:08:35,580
RED!
RED!

209
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,516
RED, HI.
I THOUGHT I MISSED YOU.

210
00:08:38,516 --> 00:08:41,486
OH, YEAH, WAIT.

211
00:08:42,053 --> 00:08:43,655
HI, HAROLD.

212
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:45,690
TO ALL YOU YOUNG
PEOPLE OUT THERE,
LISTEN UP,

213
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,393
I'M GOING TO BE STARTING
A NATURE CLUB UP HERE

214
00:08:48,393 --> 00:08:50,462
FOR ALL THE YOUNG
PEOPLE OF POSSUM LAKE.

215
00:08:50,462 --> 00:08:53,665
IT'S GOING TO BE
CALLED THE POSSUM PACK.

216
00:08:53,665 --> 00:08:55,734
SO EVERY WEEK YOU GUYS
ARE GOING TO COME UP HERE,

217
00:08:55,734 --> 00:08:57,168
WE'RE GOING TO BE
LEARNING ABOUT NATURE

218
00:08:57,168 --> 00:09:00,572
AND WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE SNACKS AND
JUICE, HUH?

219
00:09:00,572 --> 00:09:03,041
AND I'M GOING TO TEACH
YOU ABOUT THE GREAT OUTDOORS

220
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:06,044
AND YOU'RE GOING TO
BE ABLE TO EARN BADGES
FOR PASSING CERTAIN TESTS.

221
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:07,712
I THINK THAT'S
A GREAT IDEA, GORD.

222
00:09:07,712 --> 00:09:09,981
ANY TIME YOU CAN PASS
YOUR KID OFF ON
ANOTHER ADULT,

223
00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:11,416
I SAY GO FOR IT.

224
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,184
BUT ACTUALLY, GORD,
I WANTED TO ASK YOU
SOME QUESTIONS HERE.

225
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:15,086
WHAT KIND OF A DEGREE
IS IT THAT YOU HAVE?

226
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:16,788
GENERAL ARTS.

227
00:09:16,788 --> 00:09:18,056
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.

228
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:19,424
WELL, WE'RE MAKING
OUR OWN BEER

229
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:21,793
AND WE NEED TO FIND
A SOURCE OF PURE
SPRING WATER.

230
00:09:21,793 --> 00:09:22,961
SURE.
FINDING WATER,

231
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:24,596
THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT THE POSSUM PACK

232
00:09:24,596 --> 00:09:26,331
COULD EARN
A BADGE FOR.

233
00:09:26,331 --> 00:09:28,066
OH, YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE LOTS OF
BADGES, ARE YOU?

234
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:29,367
OH, YEAH.

235
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:30,969
THERE'S A
SOLITAIRE BADGE

236
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:33,972
IF YOU LEARN HOW
TO PLAY 5 DIFFERENT
GAMES OF SOLITAIRE.

237
00:09:33,972 --> 00:09:37,542
THERE'S A BADGE FOR
TAKING A LONG HIKE ON
YOUR OWN AND REFLECTING.

238
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:40,712
THERE'S A BADGE
FOR COOKING FOR ONE.

239
00:09:40,712 --> 00:09:43,715
SHADOW PUPPETS.
HUH?

240
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:45,250
AND THERE'S ONE FOR
LEARNING HOW TO HAVE

241
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,453
A MEANINGFUL
CONVERSATION
WITH YOUR ECHO.

242
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:49,821
WHAT ABOUT
FIRES, GORD?

243
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:51,189
THAT WOULD BE
A GOOD BADGE THERE

244
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:52,490
BECAUSE FIRES
IS GOING TO BE

245
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,325
A BIG PART OF THEIR
LIVES UP HERE AT
POSSUM LAKE.

246
00:09:54,325 --> 00:09:55,727
GREAT IDEA.
YEAH.

247
00:09:55,727 --> 00:09:58,263
YOU COULD
HAVE PUTTING
OUT FIRES IN CARS.

248
00:09:58,263 --> 00:09:59,397
GOOD.

249
00:09:59,397 --> 00:10:00,798
PUTTING OUT
FIRES IN BOATS.

250
00:10:00,798 --> 00:10:02,100
RIGHT.

251
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,835
PUTTING OUT
FIRES ON RIVERS.

252
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:04,869
RIGHT.

253
00:10:04,869 --> 00:10:06,104
ON RIVERS?

254
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:08,573
REMEMBER LAST YEAR,
STINKY PETERSON'S
LEAKY BOAT TANK,

255
00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:09,841
GASOLINE ALL
OVER THE RIVER,

256
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:11,676
WALL OF FLAME A
HUNDRED FEET HIGH,
TWO MILES LONG.

257
00:10:11,676 --> 00:10:13,878
YOU MUST HAVE SEEN THAT.

258
00:10:13,878 --> 00:10:15,113
NO.

259
00:10:15,113 --> 00:10:18,249
OH.
NO, I MISSED IT.

260
00:10:18,249 --> 00:10:23,154
OF COURSE IT WASN'T
TECHNICALLY A FOREST FIRE.

261
00:10:24,122 --> 00:10:25,456
IT WILL COME TO NO
SURPRISE TO MOST OF US

262
00:10:25,456 --> 00:10:28,626
THAT MANY MEN IN THE
90S DO NOT KNOW HOW
TO COMMUNICATE.

263
00:10:28,626 --> 00:10:31,930
OH, UNCLE RED,
OKAY, PLEASE COME IN.

264
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,131
WE'RE JUST ABOUT
TO DEMONSTRATE

265
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:34,666
THE CORRECT WAY TO
GRACIOUSLY INVITE
SOMEONE OVER

266
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,401
TO YOUR HOUSE
FOR DINNER.

267
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:38,569
WELL, HAROLD, WHEN A GUY
WANTS TO INVITE SOMEBODY
OVER GRACIOUSLY,

268
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:41,039
HE GETS HIS
WIFE TO DO IT.

269
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,874
YES, BUT WE'RE
GOING TO CHANGE
ALL THAT.

270
00:10:42,874 --> 00:10:44,108
UNCLE RED, WOULD
YOU CALL ME

271
00:10:44,108 --> 00:10:46,044
AND INVITE
ME OVER TO YOUR
HOUSE SATURDAY NIGHT?

272
00:10:46,044 --> 00:10:47,946
NO.

273
00:10:47,946 --> 00:10:49,180
WHY NOT?

274
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,316
WELL YOU MIGHT COME.

275
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:52,350
OKAY.
OKAY.

276
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,920
WE'RE PRETENDING.
WE'RE PRETENDING.

277
00:11:00,591 --> 00:11:02,093
WELL, AREN'T
YOU GOING TO
ANSWER IT?

278
00:11:02,093 --> 00:11:06,331
I NEVER
ANSWER THE PHONE
ON THE FIRST RING.

279
00:11:07,565 --> 00:11:10,702
OKAY, NOW I'M
GETTING UP AND
I'M WALKING ACROSS.

280
00:11:10,702 --> 00:11:11,836
HELLO.

281
00:11:11,836 --> 00:11:13,571
HAROLD, YOU
DOING ANYTHING
SATURDAY NIGHT?

282
00:11:13,571 --> 00:11:15,573
SATURDAY NIGHT,
I DON'T THINK SO.

283
00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:17,475
FINE.
COME ON OVER
FOR DINNER AROUND 7.

284
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:19,243
EXCELLENT.
CAN I BRING SOMETHING --
BYE.

285
00:11:20,111 --> 00:11:23,648
AND REMEMBER WE'RE
JUST PRETENDING.

286
00:11:29,654 --> 00:11:32,356
GOOD.
VERY GOOD.

287
00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:35,993
THAT'S WHAT
WE'LL CALL THE
COMPLETELY WRONG WAY.

288
00:11:35,993 --> 00:11:38,362
HE DIDN'T EVEN
SAY WHO WAS CALLING.

289
00:11:38,362 --> 00:11:40,364
HE COULD SEE I
WAS TALKING TO HIM.

290
00:11:40,364 --> 00:11:42,400
YOU STILL
HAVE TO TELL A
PERSON WHO'S CALLING.

291
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,635
AND HE DIDN'T SAY,
YOU KNOW, IS IT A
SPECIAL OCCASION.

292
00:11:44,635 --> 00:11:46,504
IS IT A PARTY?
IS IT AN ANNIVERSARY?

293
00:11:46,504 --> 00:11:49,006
IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT,
THE GAME WILL BE ON TV.

294
00:11:49,006 --> 00:11:50,575
YOU DIDN'T MENTION
THAT TO ME.

295
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:52,410
THE GAME IS ALWAYS
ON TV SATURDAY NIGHT.

296
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,312
OKAY.
WELL HE DIDN'T SAY
IF I HAD TO BRING ANYTHING

297
00:11:54,312 --> 00:11:56,147
LIKE, YOU KNOW,
DESSERT OR A GIFT

298
00:11:56,147 --> 00:12:00,418
OR WHO'S GOING TO BE
THERE, CASUAL, FORMAL.

299
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:03,721
NOW I WILL DEMONSTRATE
THE CORRECT PROCEDURE
FOR PHONING SOMEONE.

300
00:12:03,721 --> 00:12:08,159
[ DIALING PHONE ]

301
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:10,695
YEAH?

302
00:12:10,695 --> 00:12:14,098
HELLO, UNCLE RED, IT
IS I YOUR NEPHEW,
HAROLD GREEN.

303
00:12:14,098 --> 00:12:17,068
WHO GAVE YOU MY NUMBER?

304
00:12:17,068 --> 00:12:19,203
VERY GOOD, THANK YOU.
AND HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

305
00:12:19,203 --> 00:12:20,504
BUSY.

306
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:22,106
OH, ISN'T THAT
JUST WONDERFUL.

307
00:12:22,106 --> 00:12:24,408
YES, IT IS A LOVELY
DAY, ISN'T IT?

308
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:25,876
NOT REALLY, NO.

309
00:12:25,876 --> 00:12:27,278
THE REASON I'M
CALLING, UNCLE RED,

310
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:28,913
IS TO INVITE YOU
OVER TO DINNER.
WHEN?

311
00:12:28,913 --> 00:12:31,482
WELL, I THOUGHT
I WOULD JUST HAVE
SOME MUTUAL FRIENDS.
WHEN?

312
00:12:31,482 --> 00:12:33,117
NOTHING FANCY,
OF COURSE,

313
00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:35,386
YOU KNOW JUST
LIKE SOME POT LUCK
DINNER KIND OF THING.
WHEN?

314
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:37,288
AND WE'LL ALL SIT
AROUND AND WE'LL WATCH,

315
00:12:37,288 --> 00:12:39,523
YOU KNOW, SLIDES OF
MY BUS TRIP TO BRANTFORD.

316
00:12:39,523 --> 00:12:41,993
WHEN?

317
00:12:41,993 --> 00:12:43,694
WELL, HOW ABOUT
SATURDAY NIGHT?

318
00:12:43,694 --> 00:12:45,262
OH, NO, CAN'T DO IT.

319
00:12:45,262 --> 00:12:47,465
I JUST INVITED SOMEBODY
OVER FOR DINNER
SATURDAY NIGHT.

320
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:49,700
BYE.

321
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:56,640
Red Green:
TIME FOR
ADVENTURES WITH BILL.

322
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,409
ALL WE HAVE TO
DO IS FIND HIM.

323
00:12:58,409 --> 00:13:01,879
BILL?
BILL?

324
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:04,415
THERE HE IS.

325
00:13:04,415 --> 00:13:06,083
A LOT OF TIMES WHEN
PEOPLE HAVE PADDING ON,

326
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,519
THEY DO STUFF THEY
WOULDN'T ORDINARILY DO.

327
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:11,422
AT LEAST I
HOPE HE WOULDN'T
ORDINARILY DO THAT.

328
00:13:11,422 --> 00:13:13,557
YOU GUESSED ALREADY
THAT BILL IS GOING

329
00:13:13,557 --> 00:13:16,727
TO DO A LITTLE BIT
OF LACROSSE HERE
FOR US TODAY.

330
00:13:16,727 --> 00:13:18,229
HE GAVE ME THE
ONE BAT THERE.

331
00:13:18,229 --> 00:13:19,997
HE WANTS ME TO --
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND, BILL,

332
00:13:19,997 --> 00:13:21,599
YOU WANTS ME
TO STAND THERE.

333
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:23,601
HE'S GOING TO GO
AND PROBABLY PICK UP
A COUPLE OF LACROSSE BALLS

334
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:25,469
AND TRY TO THROW ONE AT ME,
BECAUSE APPARENTLY,

335
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:27,705
YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOME
TRICK TO CATCHING A
LACROSSE BALL

336
00:13:27,705 --> 00:13:29,406
WITH THESE THINGS AND
HE WANTS TO I GUESS

337
00:13:29,406 --> 00:13:31,542
MAKE ME LOOK STUPID.

338
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:33,277
AND WHAT HAPPENED THERE?

339
00:13:33,277 --> 00:13:34,845
DID I MISS THAT?
WHERE DID IT GO?

340
00:13:34,845 --> 00:13:36,313
I DIDN'T SEE THAT --
I DIDN'T EVEN SEE IT.

341
00:13:36,313 --> 00:13:37,715
I DIDN'T EVEN SEE IT, BILL.

342
00:13:37,715 --> 00:13:39,750
WELL, THAT'S
WHY I DIDN'T SEE
IT, IT'S RIGHT THERE.

343
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,619
THERE'S A TRICK
TO THROWING THE
BALL WITH THOSE THINGS.

344
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:42,186
NO.

345
00:13:42,186 --> 00:13:43,320
NO.

346
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,522
NO.

347
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:45,589
NO.

348
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:46,724
NO.

349
00:13:46,724 --> 00:13:48,092
THERE YOU GO.
NICE TOSS.

350
00:13:48,092 --> 00:13:49,193
PUT HER IN THERE.

351
00:13:49,193 --> 00:13:50,594
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH PADDING ON THERE?

352
00:13:50,594 --> 00:13:51,729
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.

353
00:13:51,729 --> 00:13:54,331
OH, OH, OH.
OH, LOOK, THERE'S HAROLD.

354
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:55,900
HE MUST BE TIRED.

355
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,968
BILL'S NOT ALL THAT
CONCERNED WITH HAROLD.

356
00:13:57,968 --> 00:13:59,403
YOU CAN'T BE
CONCERNED WITH PEOPLE

357
00:13:59,403 --> 00:14:01,171
AND HAVE BILL'S
BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS.

358
00:14:01,171 --> 00:14:03,173
THAT'S A BOY, BILL,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIM.

359
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:05,309
SO BILL IS GOING
TO TRY ANOTHER ONE.

360
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:07,077
TOSS HER IN HERE,
BILL, TOSS HER.

361
00:14:07,077 --> 00:14:08,746
WAY HIGH.
WAY HIGH.

362
00:14:08,746 --> 00:14:10,214
OH.

363
00:14:10,214 --> 00:14:11,548
BOY, WHEN I THINK
OF THE NUMBER OF TIMES

364
00:14:11,548 --> 00:14:13,150
BILL HAS EITHER KNOCKED
MY MIRROR OFF

365
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,485
OR BROKEN MY WINDOW

366
00:14:14,485 --> 00:14:16,253
OR PUT A DENT IN
THE SIDE OF THE VAN

367
00:14:16,253 --> 00:14:17,988
OR STUCK A
KNIFE INTO A TIRE

368
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:19,523
OR BLOWN THE
WHOLE THING UP,

369
00:14:19,523 --> 00:14:23,594
I CAN'T MANAGE
BEING SO STUPID -- OH.

370
00:14:23,594 --> 00:14:26,764
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T
BE THINKING ABOUT
THAT RIGHT NOW.

371
00:14:26,764 --> 00:14:28,132
OH, I'M FINE, BILL.

372
00:14:28,132 --> 00:14:30,301
NEVER FELT
BETTER IN MY LIFE.
THANKS FOR ASKING.

373
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:31,902
NO I'M FINE.
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT IT.

374
00:14:31,902 --> 00:14:33,237
NO, NO, DON'T YOU
WORRY ABOUT IT.

375
00:14:33,237 --> 00:14:34,438
YEAH.
YEAH.

376
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:40,311
I AM FINE.

377
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:43,013
TOLD YOU I WAS FINE.

378
00:14:43,013 --> 00:14:44,515
ALL RIGHT.
TO MAKE IT SAFER NOW

379
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:46,283
I'M GOING TO KNOCK
A FEW BALLS DOWN.

380
00:14:46,283 --> 00:14:48,252
BILL SAID TO
ME JUST KEEP
GRABBING THE BALLS

381
00:14:48,252 --> 00:14:49,687
AND HITTING
THEM AT ME.

382
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:50,921
OKAY.
JUST THEM COMING.

383
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:52,322
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.
IT'S IMPORTANT.

384
00:14:52,322 --> 00:14:53,724
HE SAID KEEP THEM COMING.
NOW HE CAUGHT ONE.

385
00:14:53,724 --> 00:14:56,226
HE GOT ALL EXCITED.

386
00:14:56,226 --> 00:14:57,961
HE HAD SAID
KEEP THEM COMING.

387
00:14:57,961 --> 00:14:59,563
THIS WAY WE'RE
A LITTLE SAFER.

388
00:14:59,563 --> 00:15:00,731
BILL IS GOING TO
THROW THEM AT ME

389
00:15:00,731 --> 00:15:02,132
AND I'M GOING
TO BAT THEM.

390
00:15:02,132 --> 00:15:03,667
AND NOW NOBODY
IS IN DANGER.

391
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:05,269
WELL ALMOST NOBODY.

392
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:07,237
OH BOY.
OH BOY.
OH BOY.

393
00:15:07,237 --> 00:15:09,073
STRIKE ONE.

394
00:15:09,073 --> 00:15:10,908
STRIKE TWO.

395
00:15:10,908 --> 00:15:11,975
OH BOY.

396
00:15:11,975 --> 00:15:13,310
BALL.

397
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,945
BALL.

398
00:15:14,945 --> 00:15:16,613
STRIKE THREE.

399
00:15:16,613 --> 00:15:18,715
HE'S OUT.

400
00:15:18,715 --> 00:15:20,384
Red Green:
COMING UP WE
GOT DOUGIE FRANKLIN

401
00:15:20,384 --> 00:15:21,952
WITH A PERSONAL QUESTION

402
00:15:21,952 --> 00:15:23,620
AND BUZZ SHERWOOD
SAYS THE ANSWER IS

403
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,622
BLOWING IN THE WIND.

404
00:15:31,261 --> 00:15:32,396
WELL, OUR SECOND
BATCH OF BEER

405
00:15:32,396 --> 00:15:35,332
DIDN'T REALLY WORK OUT
ANY BETTER THAN THE FIRST.

406
00:15:35,332 --> 00:15:38,168
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW
THE ROMANS CAN BREW
BEER AND WE CAN'T.

407
00:15:38,168 --> 00:15:40,504
MAYBE WE SHOULD
HAVE A TOGA PARTY.

408
00:15:40,504 --> 00:15:42,206
DID YOU ADD
ENOUGH SUGAR?

409
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:44,708
I MEAN, DID YOU
LET THE BEER BREW AND
FERMENT FOR TWO WEEKS?

410
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:47,544
TWO WEEKS?
WHO HAS THAT
KIND OF TIME?

411
00:15:47,544 --> 00:15:49,179
UNCLE RED, YOU
GOT TO DO IT.

412
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:51,615
WELL, DON'T
THEY HAVE LIKE
A MINUTE BEER?

413
00:15:51,615 --> 00:15:53,717
I'M SORRY, YOU CANNOT
MAKE A FINE QUALITY LAGER

414
00:15:53,717 --> 00:15:57,688
WITH LIKE, YOU KNOW,
KOOL-AID TECHNOLOGY.

415
00:15:57,688 --> 00:15:58,989
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

416
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:00,290
WE'LL TRY IT AGAIN.

417
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,359
ACTUALLY, THIS TIME
WE HAVE A REAL PROPER VAT

418
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:04,027
TO BREW THE BEER IN.

419
00:16:04,027 --> 00:16:05,829
A REAL BEER VAT?

420
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:07,197
ONE WHERE YOU CAN
LET THE BEER BREW

421
00:16:07,197 --> 00:16:09,366
AND FERMENT
FOR TWO WEEKS?

422
00:16:09,366 --> 00:16:11,368
OKAY, NOT A REAL
PROPER VAT, NO,

423
00:16:11,368 --> 00:16:13,704
BUT THERE'S A STARCH
FACTORY UP ON BACK
BEND ROAD.

424
00:16:13,704 --> 00:16:15,005
THEY GOT A WATER
TOWER THERE

425
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:16,406
FULL TO THE BRIM
WITH PURE RAIN WATER,

426
00:16:16,406 --> 00:16:18,308
WE CAN MIX THE
BEER IN THERE.

427
00:16:18,308 --> 00:16:19,776
AND TO HEAT IT UP?

428
00:16:19,776 --> 00:16:21,011
WELL, THIS IS THE BEAUTY.

429
00:16:21,011 --> 00:16:22,646
THE STARCH PLANT
HAS BEEN CONDEMNED,

430
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:24,681
SO WE CAN TORCH IT,
BOIL THE BEER.

431
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:26,283
I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING, IN TWO WEEKS

432
00:16:26,283 --> 00:16:29,219
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
15,000 GALLONS OF BEER.

433
00:16:29,219 --> 00:16:32,723
WE'RE GOING TO
CALL IT "ARSON ALE".

434
00:16:33,857 --> 00:16:36,059
OH, UNCLE RED, THAT'S
A REALLY BIG FACTORY.

435
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:38,195
WHAT IF THE FIRE
GETS OUT OF CONTROL
AND STARTS TO SPREAD?

436
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:41,164
HOW YOU GOING TO
GET THE FIRE OUT?

437
00:16:41,164 --> 00:16:43,400
WITH THE BEER.

438
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,534
OKAY.

439
00:16:44,534 --> 00:16:45,802
WELL, HOW YOU GOING
TO GET THE BEER
FROM THE TOWER

440
00:16:45,802 --> 00:16:47,070
TO WHERE THE
FIRE IS?

441
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:50,674
WE'LL DRINK
IT AND USE OUR
BODIES AS FIRE TRUCKS.

442
00:16:53,377 --> 00:16:56,813
ALL RIGHT, BUT WATCH
OUT FOR BACKDRAFTS.

443
00:16:58,849 --> 00:17:01,952
IF THERE'S ANY
ELIGIBLE WOMEN OUT
THERE, I'M AVAILABLE,

444
00:17:01,952 --> 00:17:05,222
AND I'M HAPPY
TO ANNOUNCE I HAVE
THE ONLY MONSTER TRUCK

445
00:17:05,222 --> 00:17:07,858
AND THE BIGGEST ONE
IN THE POSSUM LAKE AREA.

446
00:17:07,858 --> 00:17:11,628
I PREFER WOMEN
WHO ARE PETITE, BLOND

447
00:17:11,628 --> 00:17:13,697
AND KIND OF
ON THE SLIM SIDE

448
00:17:13,697 --> 00:17:18,034
AND AREN'T AFRAID
OF LOUD NOISES.

449
00:17:18,768 --> 00:17:19,669
WELCOME BACK.

450
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:20,904
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOING
TO CONTINUE ON

451
00:17:20,904 --> 00:17:22,272
WITH THE ICE MAKING PART
OF OUR REFRIGERATION

452
00:17:22,272 --> 00:17:23,573
RENOVATION THING HERE.

453
00:17:23,573 --> 00:17:25,142
AND LIKE I SAID
BEFORE, YOU NEED
AN ICE CUBE TRAY

454
00:17:25,142 --> 00:17:26,610
AND A CUPBOARD
DOOR HANDLE.

455
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,044
NOW, YOU TAKE THE
CUPBOARD DOOR HANDLE

456
00:17:28,044 --> 00:17:30,313
AND YOU MOUNT
THAT TO THE INSIDE

WAY AT THE BACK
THOUGH, ALL RIGHT?

458
00:17:32,282 --> 00:17:34,851
THEN YOU HANG YOUR ICE
CUBE TRAY ONTO THE
DOOR HANDLE

459
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:37,587
WITH THE HOOK RIGHT
LIKE THAT, EXACTLY --

HANG THE ICE CUBE

SOME DUCT TAPE ON
HERE, STICKY SIDE UP,

465

SO THAT I CAN
ACTUALLY STICK THE TRAY

WON'T STICK WHEN
IT'S FROZEN.

469
00:17:58,408 --> 00:17:59,943
WELL THAT'S GOOD
BECAUSE WHAT IT MEANS

470
00:17:59,943 --> 00:18:01,645
IS WHEN THE ICE
CUBES ARE ALL FROZEN,

471

THE DUCT TAPE IS
GOING TO LET GO

472
00:18:03,013 --> 00:18:04,648
AND THE TRAY WILL FALL
BACK AND REST AGAINST

THE INSIDE OF THE
BACK OF THE FREEZER.

474

NOW ON THE OUTSIDE
OF THE BACK OF THE FREEZER,

475
00:18:08,118 --> 00:18:09,486
RIGHT WHERE THAT TRAY
IS GOING TO BE,

476
00:18:09,486 --> 00:18:11,521
WE MOUNT THIS PADDLE.

477
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:13,590
AND WE JUST MOUNT IT
AT THE BOTTOM SO IT'S
NICE AND SPRINGY

478
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,924
AND WHEN YOU
WANT AN ICE CUBE,

479
00:18:14,924 --> 00:18:17,594
YOU JUST PULL
BACK ON THE PADDLE
AND LET HER GO, WHACK.

OF COURSE THE ICE
CUBE HAS GOT TO GET OUT
OF THE FREEZER SOMEHOW,

482
00:18:20,697 --> 00:18:23,633
SO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO
IS PUT A HOLE IN
THE FRONT DOOR,

RIGHT DIRECTLY
IN FRONT OF WHERE
THAT TRAY IS HANGING.

YOU CAN CUT THAT
WITH TIN SNIPS, OF COURSE,

YOU'RE GOING
TO NEED A PILOT HOLE.

487
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,613
RIGHT TOOL FOR
THE RIGHT JOB.

488

OF FILLING THE ICE CUBE

491
