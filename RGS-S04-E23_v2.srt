NOW, A LOT OF
THE SENIORS USE THESE

149
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:02,054
SO THEY'RE EASY
TO BORROW... OR WHATEVER.

150
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:03,956
AND WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
IS OPEN THAT UP

151
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,591
AND FILL THAT UP WITH
SOME OF THE CAR BATTERIES,

152
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:10,796
AND THEN YOU WANT TO CUT THE
HANDLE HERE RIGHT IN HALF

153
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:12,731
SO SHE'LL THREAD
THROUGH YOUR BELT LOOPS,

154
00:07:12,731 --> 00:07:14,800
MAKES IT EASIER
FOR TOWING.

155
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,836
NOW TO CONNECT ALL THE
APPLIANCES ON TO THE COUNTER,

156
00:07:17,836 --> 00:07:19,438
WE COULD DRILL HOLES
AND BOLT THEM IN THERE

157
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:23,275
OR WE COULD GLUE THEM ON
WITH SOME SORT OF A
POLYMER ADHESIVE,

158
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:26,445
BUT THAT WOULD PROBABLY RUIN
THE MARBLE LAMINATE
BAKE STUFF,

159
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:28,914
SO INSTEAD WE'RE GOING TO USE
THE HANDYMAN SECRET WEAPON,

160
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:30,982
DUCT TAPE.

161
00:07:33,318 --> 00:07:35,353
SHE'S STARTING TO
TAKE SHAPE, ISN'T SHE?

162
00:07:35,353 --> 00:07:37,723
GOT EVERYTHING LAID OUT HERE
JUST THE WAY I WANT IT.

163
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:40,125
GOT THE POPCORN MAKER
THERE AT THE END, GOT THE
TOASTER NEXT TO THAT,

164
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:43,195
AND THEY'RE BOTH SITTING
ON TOP OF MY MICROWAVE
OVEN THERE.

165
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:44,963
THAT'S ALL PLUGGED IN TO
THE BATTERIES OF COURSE

166
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:47,499
AND I GOT THE CAMP BARBECUE,
KIND OF A NEAT LITTLE THING,

167
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:49,501
THE BRIQUETTES
ARE A LITTLE SCARY.

168
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:51,570
AND OVER ON THIS SIDE
I GOT THE DEEP FRYER,

169
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,338
AND I GOT THE CREPE MAKER,
I GOT DONUTS THERE,

170
00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:55,207
I GOT THE DRINKS AND I GOT A
LITTLE HOT PLATE OVER HERE

171
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:57,843
AND I GOT A LITTLE HOT
CHOCOLATE, CAPPUCCINO
OR SOMETHING.

172
00:07:57,843 --> 00:08:00,445
AND THIS HERE IN THE TAP HOLES,
SOMETHING REAL NEAT HERE,

173
00:08:00,445 --> 00:08:01,680
IDEAL FOR THE CONDIMENTS.

174
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,082
I JUST REACH DOWN UNDERNEATH
GIVE THIS A LITTLE SQUEEZE,

175
00:08:04,082 --> 00:08:05,717
AND I GOT MYSELF
SOME KETCHUP.

176
00:08:05,717 --> 00:08:08,119
WANT TO ADD A LITTLE MUSTARD
TO THAT, NO PROBLEM.

177
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:09,821
LET'S FIRE HER UP.

178
00:08:09,821 --> 00:08:11,923
MAYBE FIRE
IS A BAD WORD.

179
00:08:11,923 --> 00:08:14,893
I GOT HER WORKING NOW,
AND I CAN FOLLOW THOSE TOURISTS

180
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:17,295
ANYWHERE THEY WANT TO GO,
MAKING FOOD FOR THEM.

181
00:08:17,295 --> 00:08:18,997
EVEN IF THEY'RE
NOT ON THE GO,

182
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:21,333
THEY CERTAINLY WILL BE
AFTER EATING THIS STUFF.

183
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,934
SO IF WOMEN DON'T
FIND YOU HANDSOME,

184
00:08:22,934 --> 00:08:24,836
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

185
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:27,472
HERE'S COOKING
AT YOU, KID.

186
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:35,113
Red: STAY TUNED AND
SEE WHAT NOT TO DO

187
00:08:35,113 --> 00:08:37,482
WITH ONE OF THEM RADIO
CONTROLLED MODEL AIRPLANES;

188
00:08:37,482 --> 00:08:40,318
AND I'M GOING TO MAKE AN EAR
BIGGER THAN PRINCE CHARLES'.

189
00:08:44,923 --> 00:08:46,758
I WANT TO TALK
TO ALL YOU GUYS

190
00:08:46,758 --> 00:08:48,827
WHO ARE JUST CELEBRATING
YOUR 50th BIRTHDAY

191
00:08:48,827 --> 00:08:50,895
OR JUST GETTING
OVER THE HANGOVER.

192
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:53,531
YOU'LL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING
ABOUT WHEN THEY BRING IN
THE BIRTHDAY CAKE

193
00:08:53,531 --> 00:08:56,267
AND TELL YOU EVERY CANDLE
REPRESENTS A DECADE.

194
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:58,570
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GET
TO MID-LIFE A LOT OF TIMES

195
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,206
YOU STOP AND REFLECT
ON YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS,

196
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:03,341
YOUR POSITION
IN THE COMMUNITY

197
00:09:03,341 --> 00:09:05,410
AND YOUR CAREER
AND YOUR FAMILY SITUATION.

198
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,046
AND A LOT OF TIMES YOU COME
TO THE CONCLUSION THAT
LIFE STINKS

199
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:10,115
AND YOU REALLY BLEW IT.

200
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:12,717
BUT YOU KNOW YOU GOT TO LOOK
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, YOU KNOW,

201
00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:15,487
ACTUALLY ALMOST
EVERYBODY'S LIFE STINKS.

202
00:09:15,487 --> 00:09:17,255
HARDLY ANYBODY GETS
WHAT THEY WANT.

203
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:18,790
MILLIONAIRES WANT TO BE
BILLIONAIRES,

204
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,625
MARRIED GUYS WANT
TO BE PLAYBOYS,

205
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,128
PLAYBOYS WANT TO MEET
SOMEONE WORTH MARRYING.

206
00:09:23,128 --> 00:09:26,131
MAYBE YOU REGRET NOT MARRYING
THAT FIRST GIRLFRIEND

207
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:28,266
WHEN YOU WERE
BOTH SWEET 16.

208
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:31,035
BUT, REMEMBER, YOU'RE
NOT SWEET 16 ANYMORE
AND NEITHER IS SHE.

209
00:09:31,035 --> 00:09:32,837
IF YOU PASSED EACH OTHER
ON THE STREET TODAY,

210
00:09:32,837 --> 00:09:36,975
YOU'D BOTH BE THINKING, BOY,
SOMEBODY'S REALLY LET
THEMSELVES GO.

211
00:09:36,975 --> 00:09:38,977
SO IF YOU'RE SITTING
THERE THINKING

212
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:40,845
THAT YOUR LIFE IS OVER
AND YOU REALLY BLEW IT,

213
00:09:40,845 --> 00:09:43,114
REMEMBER YOUR LIFE
IS ONLY HALF OVER

214
00:09:43,114 --> 00:09:45,083
AND YOU ONLY HALF BLEW IT.

215
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,986
SO GET OUT THERE
AND FINISH THE JOB.

216
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:50,188
REMEMBER,
I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

217
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:52,924
WE'RE ALL IN
THIS TOGETHER.

218
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,900
WELL, THE PROJECT TO
TURN ROCK REEF POINT

219
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,069
INTO A GIANT SLEEPING POSSUM
HAS HIT A FEW SNAGS.

220
00:10:08,873 --> 00:10:11,576
I MADE THE LEFT EAR,

221
00:10:12,677 --> 00:10:14,445
STINKY MADE THE RIGHT EAR

222
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,150
AND MOOSE THOMPSON MADE A
HEAD OUT OF HOLLOW PLYWOOD.

223
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,252
WHY WOULD HE MAKE
THE HEAD HOLLOW?

224
00:10:21,252 --> 00:10:24,122
WORKING FROM EXPERIENCE,
I GUESS, HAROLD.

225
00:10:24,122 --> 00:10:27,292
THEN STINKY ATTACHED A SHEET
METAL TAIL TO THE END
OF HER THERE

226
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:28,960
AND THEN THE WIND COME UP
AND WE HAD A REAL PROBLEM.

227
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,363
YEAH, I KNOW, A BIG WOODEN
EYE WENT FLYING PASSED
MY BEDROOM WINDOW.

228
00:10:32,363 --> 00:10:34,632
I THOUGHT I WAS IN
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

229
00:10:34,632 --> 00:10:36,935
YOU ARE, HAROLD.

230
00:10:36,935 --> 00:10:39,037
THE WHOLE FACE WENT UP AND
SMASHED TO A MILLION BITS

231
00:10:39,037 --> 00:10:40,672
ON TOP OF
ROCK REEF POINT,

232
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:43,074
BUT THE METAL TAIL SWUNG DOWN,
JAMMED RIGHT INTO
THE ROCK FACE,

233
00:10:43,074 --> 00:10:44,742
AND THEN WE NOTICED
WHAT WE HAD THERE,

234
00:10:44,742 --> 00:10:46,311
WE HAD A ROCK FACE

235
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:48,413
WITH A GIANT METAL TAIL
JAMMED IN THERE FOR A NOSE.

236
00:10:48,413 --> 00:10:50,214
AND YOU KNOW WHO THAT
LOOKED LIKE, HAROLD?

237
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:52,617
OH, YEAH,
IT WAS AMAZING, YEAH.

238
00:10:52,617 --> 00:10:54,919
IT LOOKED JUST LIKE A
GUY WITH NO FACE
AND NO HAIR

239
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:57,288
AND A BIG POSSUM TAIL
FOR A NOSE.

240
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:00,958
EXACTLY,
JOHN A. MacDONALD.

241
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,561
RONALD McDONALD'S
BROTHER?

242
00:11:03,561 --> 00:11:05,363
SIR JOHN A. MacDONALD,
HAROLD,

243
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:07,265
THE FIRST
PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA.

244
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:09,400
AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO
PUT ANOTHER FACE ON EACH
SIDE OF HIM THERE,

245
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,169
AND WE CAN HAVE A
NATURAL FORMATION

246
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:12,570
LIKE THAT MOUNT RUSHMORE
THEY GOT IN THE STATES.

247
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,473
UNCLE RED, THOSE FACES ARE
CARVED INTO THAT STONE
OF MOUNT RUSHMORE.

248
00:11:15,473 --> 00:11:17,375
IT'S NOT A
NATURAL FORMATION.

249
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,210
YOU SHOULD TALK.

250
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,012
WELL,
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

251
00:11:21,012 --> 00:11:22,647
IF THEY CAN CARVE THEM,
WE CAN CARVE THEM.

252
00:11:22,647 --> 00:11:24,482
WHAT WE'LL DO IS PUT
SOME FACES UP THERE

253
00:11:24,482 --> 00:11:26,884
OF THE MEN WHO HAVE MADE
THIS COUNTRY AS GREAT
AS IT IS, HAROLD.

254
00:11:26,884 --> 00:11:30,121
OH, GREAT, THE FATHERS
OF CONFEDERATION AND
WAYNE GRETZKY!

255
00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:34,158
WE'RE HERE AT
FIRE TOWER 13

256
00:11:34,158 --> 00:11:35,993
WITH THE MAN WHO STANDS
ON GUARD FOR TREES,

257
00:11:35,993 --> 00:11:37,762
RANGER GORD.

258
00:11:37,762 --> 00:11:39,263
THANKS A LOT
FOR COMING, RED.

259
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:40,531
ALL RIGHT,
NO PROBLEM.

260
00:11:40,531 --> 00:11:42,033
THANKS A LOT.
OKAY.

261
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:43,868
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.

262
00:11:43,868 --> 00:11:45,770
COME HERE, HAROLD.
COME HERE.

263
00:11:48,306 --> 00:11:49,941
WHERE ARE THE
REST OF THE GUYS?

264
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:51,742
OH, THEY'RE UP AT
ROCK REEF POINT,

265
00:11:51,742 --> 00:11:53,978
YOU KNOW, CARVING ROCKS,
THAT KIND OF THING.

266
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:56,147
I MADE STONE BAKED
PIZZA FOR EVERYONE.

267
00:11:56,147 --> 00:11:57,615
OH MY GOSH.
YEAH.

268
00:11:57,615 --> 00:11:59,383
IT'LL BE COOKED
BY HIGH NOON.

269
00:11:59,383 --> 00:12:00,952
WELL, MAYBE HAROLD AND I
WILL HAVE A PIECE
OF THAT LATER,

270
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:02,653
BECAUSE WE DO WANT TO
TALK TO YOU ABOUT ROCKS,
YOU KNOW,

271
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:04,856
IF YOU WERE GOING TO,
SAY, DO SOME CARVING

272
00:12:04,856 --> 00:12:06,691
OR MAYBE MAKE LIKE A
MOUNT RUSHMORE TYPE
OF THING,

273
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:08,092
WHATEVER IT WAS THAT
YOU HAD IN MIND.

274
00:12:08,092 --> 00:12:09,827
YOU GUYS ARE MAKING
A MOUNT RUSHMORE?

275
00:12:09,827 --> 00:12:12,964
WELL, YEAH, BUT WE'RE
DOING IT WITH FAMOUS
CANADIANS, YEAH.

276
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:14,765
THAT'S WHY YOU
CAME TO ME?

277
00:12:14,765 --> 00:12:17,001
WELL, YEAH, BECAUSE
I THOUGHT WITH THE
ROCK THING.

278
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:19,270
OKAY!
WHAT? WHAT?

279
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:22,540
I'M GOING TO BE
IMMORTALIZED
IN STONE.

280
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,375
GOSH.

281
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:27,278
THE MAN WHO NEVER
ABANDONED HIS POST.

282
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:29,814
THE MAN WHO
NEVER LOST FAITH,

283
00:12:29,814 --> 00:12:34,285
RANGER GORD, WHO'S HEAD,
100 FEET HIGH,

284
00:12:34,285 --> 00:12:36,187
SOLID ROCK.

285
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:38,122
YEAH, THAT PART
SOUNDS RIGHT.

286
00:12:38,122 --> 00:12:41,492
OKAY, WELL, A LOT OF
THE ROCK AROUND HERE
IS IGNEOUS ROCK.

287
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:43,427
IT'S PART OF THE
CANADIAN SHIELD.

288
00:12:43,427 --> 00:12:45,162
IT'S GRANITE.
PERFECT FOR CARVING.

289
00:12:45,162 --> 00:12:47,164
AND WHAT ABOUT THE ROCK
UP AT ROCK REEF POINT?

290
00:12:47,164 --> 00:12:51,035
WELL, MOST OF THAT IS
MICA, SANDSTONE AND
LIMESTONE.
WOW.

291
00:12:51,035 --> 00:12:53,070
YEAH, IT WAS FORMED FROM
THE WASTE OF THE QUARRIES

292
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,839
THAT USED
TO BE AROUND HERE.

293
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,440
OH, SO IF YOU TRIED
TO CARVE THAT STUFF.

294
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,975
LANDSLIDE.

295
00:12:57,975 --> 00:13:00,177
OH BOY, HAROLD,
WE GOTTA GO.

296
00:13:00,177 --> 00:13:01,912
NO. NO.

297
00:13:01,912 --> 00:13:03,147
WHAT ABOUT THE PIZZA?

298
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:06,083
[ SLOSHING SOUND ]
Red: EW! OH!

299
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,786
JUST HAVE SOME
OFF YOUR SHOE.

300
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:14,091
IT'S MAIL CALL.

301
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,862
WHOO!

302
00:13:18,696 --> 00:13:20,398
ALL RIGHT,
WE GOT A LETTER HERE.

303
00:13:20,398 --> 00:13:21,732
HERE'S THE FIRST LETTER.

304
00:13:21,732 --> 00:13:23,868
IT'S FROM NEIL BARON OF
MOUNT PEARL, NEWFOUNDLAND.

305
00:13:23,868 --> 00:13:25,870
AND NEIL POSES A
NUMBER OF QUESTIONS,

306
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,972
BUT THE ONE THAT STRUCK
MY FANCY WAS,

307
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:31,308
"DEAR RED  GREEN, WHAT IS
YOUR FAVOURITE POWER TOOL?"

308
00:13:31,308 --> 00:13:36,080
THAT'S A
TOUGH ONE, NEIL, 'CAUSE,

309
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,917
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY
THERE'S A RIGHT TOOL
FOR EVERY JOB,

310
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:43,420
EXCEPTION BEING
HAROLD HERE.

311
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,990
YOU REALLY HAVE TO CLARIFY
WHAT THE WORK IS

312
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,791
BEFORE YOU CAN PICK
YOUR FAVOURITE TOOL.

313
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:51,695
FOR EXAMPLE, YOU WOULDN'T
WANT TO BUILD A DOCK
WITH A LATHE.

314
00:13:51,695 --> 00:13:54,031
MAYBE THE MOST VERSATILE TOOL
WOULD BE A GOOD CHOICE,

315
00:13:54,031 --> 00:13:56,100
YOU KNOW, LIKE AN
ELECTRIC DRILL.

316
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,801
IT HAS A VARIETY OF
APPLICATIONS.

317
00:13:57,801 --> 00:13:59,937
YEAH, OKAY, MOST DEFINITELY
AN ELECTRIC DRILL

318
00:13:59,937 --> 00:14:01,972
WOULD BE MY CHOICE,
MOST DEFINITELY.

319
00:14:01,972 --> 00:14:05,075
HE'S NOT ASKING
YOU, HAROLD.

320
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:08,078
OKAY, TRUE ENOUGH,
YOU KNOW,

321
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:10,314
BUT I WAS JUST, YOU KNOW,
I'M THINKING, I'M SUGGESTING,

322
00:14:10,314 --> 00:14:12,917
YOU KNOW, ELECTRIC DRILL
AS A SUGGESTION.

323
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:16,820
THAT'S JUST WHAT I'M JUST
THINKING IS, YOU KNOW,
ELECTRIC DRILL.

324
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,189
WELL, SUDDENLY I'M
THINKING PILE DRIVER.

325
00:14:21,926 --> 00:14:24,495
NOW, NEIL, THERE ARE
REALLY TWO COMPONENTS

326
00:14:24,495 --> 00:14:25,963
TO YOUR MAJOR POWER TOOL.

327
00:14:25,963 --> 00:14:27,197
YOU GOT THE ROTATIONAL SPIN

328
00:14:27,197 --> 00:14:29,133
AND YOU GOT
THE FORWARD IMPACT.

329
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:31,769
NOW, THERE'S A THING CALLED A
ROTOHAMMER, OR A HAMMER DRILL,

330
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:33,804
THAT ACTUALLY COMBINES
THESE TWO FORCES.

331
00:14:33,804 --> 00:14:35,706
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!

332
00:14:35,706 --> 00:14:37,641
I SAW ONE OF THOSE.
YEAH.

333
00:14:37,641 --> 00:14:40,044
IT'S GOES WA-BOO, WA-BOO,
WA-BOO, WA-BOO.

334
00:14:40,044 --> 00:14:43,480
IT'S GOT LIKE A BIT AND A
CHISEL, WA-BOO, WA-BOO.

335
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,748
IT'S SO
COOL, RIGHT?

336
00:14:44,748 --> 00:14:47,951
NO ONE CARES, HAROLD,
WHAT YOU SAW.

337
00:14:47,951 --> 00:14:52,556
SO, NEIL, TO GET YOURSELF
THE BIG FRAME ROTOHAMMER,

338
00:14:52,556 --> 00:14:55,559
TAKE THAT ELECTRIC MOTOR
OFF THERE, THROW THAT
ONE INTO THE LAKE

339
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:59,930
AND STICK ON, SAY, A SLANT SIX
OUT OF A '63 VALIENT,

340
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,000
CLAMP HER DOWN WITH THE BIG
BUFFER CLAMPS ON THERE

341
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,470
AND I'LL TELL YOU, YOU GOT
ONE HECK OF A POWER TOOL
IN YOUR HAND, FELLA.

342
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,705
IT WOULD BE A LITTLE HARD TO
HANDLE, WOULDN'T IT?

343
00:15:08,705 --> 00:15:11,675
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO RUN HER FOR LONG.

344
00:15:11,675 --> 00:15:13,777
AND REMEMBER, NEIL,

345
00:15:13,777 --> 00:15:15,946
LET THE WEIGHT OF THE TOOL
DO THE WORK, ALL RIGHT?

346
00:15:15,946 --> 00:15:17,981
AND SEND US A PICTURE
IF YOU TRY THIS

347
00:15:17,981 --> 00:15:20,551
'CAUSE ACTUALLY I JUST
THOUGHT OF IT RIGHT NOW.

348
00:15:20,551 --> 00:15:23,220
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
LEAD OUR VIEWERS ON
LIKE THAT.

349
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,155
JUST A LITTLE
HARMLESS FUN, HAROLD.

350
00:15:25,155 --> 00:15:27,090
YEAH, WELL, WHAT IF
SOMEBODY GETS HURT?

351
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:30,494
IT'S HARMFUL FUN THEN.

352
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:35,299
WHAT IF SOMEBODY
SUES YOU?

353
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:38,001
ALL RIGHT,
AN ELECTRIC DRILL.

354
00:15:40,604 --> 00:15:42,239
ONE OF MY FAVOURITE
HOBBIES TODAY,

355
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:44,107
MODEL AIRPLANE FLYING
ON ADVENTURES WITH BILL.

356
00:15:44,107 --> 00:15:47,144
IT TOOK ME TWO YEARS TO BUILD
THIS PARTICULAR MODEL THAT
I HAVE RIGHT HERE.

357
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:49,713
BUT BILL'S HERE NOW.

358
00:15:49,713 --> 00:15:52,015
THANK YOU, BILL.

359
00:15:52,015 --> 00:15:54,184
NOW, YOU DON'T WANT TO GET
UPSET SOMETIMES WHEN
THINGS HAPPEN

360
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:56,420
BECAUSE LOOK WHAT HE'S DONE
HERE, LOOK WHAT HE'S DONE,
LOOK WHAT HE'S DONE.

361
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,921
HE'S BROUGHT
A REPLACEMENT.

362
00:15:57,921 --> 00:16:01,792
AND SUDDENLY I'M THINKING,
HEY, I DIDN'T LIKE THAT
OLD PLANE ANYHOW.

363
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:05,028
WHO CARES, HUH?

364
00:16:05,028 --> 00:16:08,899
WHAT? WHAT?
OH. OH.

365
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:11,368
I GUESS I MIS --
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

366
00:16:11,368 --> 00:16:13,537
DOESN'T MATTER
WHOSE IT IS.

367
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:17,074
THE THING WITH A HOBBY IS
IT'S A GREAT IDEA,

368
00:16:17,074 --> 00:16:19,076
RELAXING AND TAKES YOUR
MIND OFF YOUR WORRIES

369
00:16:19,076 --> 00:16:20,811
AND JUST GO OUT
THERE AND JUST --

370
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:23,880
BILL TAKES A TURKEY
BASTER OUT OF JACKET,
WHICH MAKES SENSE.

371
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,016
AND I'M TRYING TO FOOL
AROUND -- THIS IS THE
RADIO CONTROL.

372
00:16:26,016 --> 00:16:27,617
IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE
THE STRINGS OR THE WIRES.

373
00:16:27,617 --> 00:16:29,119
THIS IS ONE OF
THESE FANCY UNITS,

374
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:30,787
BUT SHE DOESN'T
SEEM TO BE --

375
00:16:30,787 --> 00:16:34,024
A COUPLE OF FUNNELS
TO GET THE GAS IN,
GOT HER GASSED UP.

376
00:16:34,024 --> 00:16:36,226
AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE
CONTROLLER.

377
00:16:36,226 --> 00:16:37,995
AND I THINK IT'S
THE BATTERIES ON THAT.

378
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:41,665
YOU KNOW, I THINK WHEN YOU
LEAVE THE BATTERIES IN THERE
FOR OVER 7, 8 YEARS --

379
00:16:41,665 --> 00:16:44,167
BILL, I THINK YOU
MAY BE A LITTLE PREMATURE --

380
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:46,670
I THINK YOU WERE
EARLY ON THAT ONE.

381
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,605
I'M TRYING TO
SHOW HIM THE --

382
00:16:48,605 --> 00:16:52,175
WITH BILL ANYTHING HE DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND, HE LICKS,

383
00:16:52,175 --> 00:16:54,578
WHICH CAN BE A DANGEROUS,
DANGEROUS HABIT.

384
00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:56,546
ANYWAY, UP SHE GOES,
THE PLANE.

385
00:16:56,546 --> 00:16:59,182
AND THEN SHE TURNS AROUND
AND SHE STARTS HEADING BACK
TOWARDS US AND TAKES OFF.

386
00:16:59,182 --> 00:17:03,420
YOU KNOW, WITH A HOBBY
YOU'RE GETTING OUT IN
THE OUTDOORS,

387
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,722
YOU'RE GETTING
SOME EXERCISE THERE,

388
00:17:05,722 --> 00:17:08,425
AND YOU GET TO
EXPERIENCE, YOU KNOW,

389
00:17:08,425 --> 00:17:10,894
SOME BONDING AND SPENDING
A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER

390
00:17:10,894 --> 00:17:13,597
AND, YOU KNOW, IT GETS
THE HEART GOING, GETS
THE BLOOD BUMPING.

391
00:17:13,597 --> 00:17:16,533
BILL SUDDENLY REALIZES WHAT
HE NEEDS IS ANOTHER
RADIO CONTROLLER.

392
00:17:16,533 --> 00:17:18,635
SO WE GOT ONE IN THE
BACK OF THE VAN THERE,

393
00:17:18,635 --> 00:17:20,370
AND I GUESS ONE'S
AS GOOD AS THE NEXT

394
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,139
AND HE STARTS
FLICKING THAT AROUND.

395
00:17:22,139 --> 00:17:24,474
NO. NO.
THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT --

396
00:17:24,474 --> 00:17:25,909
WHAT THE HECK?

397
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:28,912
NO. NO.
GET RID OF -- ALL RIGHT.

398
00:17:28,912 --> 00:17:31,548
AS I SAY, YOU GET A CHANCE TO
THINK AND BE INNOVATIVE

399
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:32,949
AND COME UP
WITH OTHER SOLU --

400
00:17:32,949 --> 00:17:34,651
HERE'S ANOTHER
RADIO CONTROLLER.

401
00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:36,253
WE GOT TONS OF
THEM IN THERE.

402
00:17:36,253 --> 00:17:38,655
AND THIS ONE I THINK
IS GOING TO -- WHAT?

403
00:17:38,655 --> 00:17:41,358
I DON'T --

404
00:17:41,358 --> 00:17:43,994
OH THAT'S --

405
00:17:43,994 --> 00:17:47,364
HE'S TURNED IT
INTO A CAR.

406
00:17:47,364 --> 00:17:49,766
AS I SAY, THE HOBBY
CAN BE RELAXING

407
00:17:49,766 --> 00:17:51,234
AND CAN KIND OF GET
YOUR FRUSTRATIONS UP.

408
00:17:51,234 --> 00:17:52,802
WAY YOU GO, BILL.
WAY YOU GO.
WAY YOU GO.

409
00:17:53,937 --> 00:17:56,740
Red: STAY TUNED WHILE DALTON
GIVES US ALL THE FINGER,

410
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,111
AND I EXPERIENCE
THE LONELINESS OF THE
LONG DISTANCE POET.

411
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:04,848
[ APPLAUSE ]

412
00:18:07,384 --> 00:18:10,053
WELL, THE BIG SCULPTURE
PROJECT UP AT ROCK REEF POINT

413
00:18:10,053 --> 00:18:11,421
IS MOVING AHEAD OKAY.

414
00:18:11,421 --> 00:18:13,356
WE FIND THAT WHEN YOU'RE
DOING PAINTING A PICTURE

415
00:18:13,356 --> 00:18:15,892
OR PERHAPS DOING
A SCULPTURE OF A
CANADIAN FAMOUS PERSON

416
00:18:15,892 --> 00:18:17,961
YOU'RE BETTER TO STAY KIND OF
NONCOMMITTAL ON WHO IT IS

417
00:18:17,961 --> 00:18:20,497
UNTIL YOU SEE HOW
SHE TURNS OUT.

418
00:18:20,497 --> 00:18:22,732
BOY, BY THE TIME YOU
GUYS ARE FINISHED WITH
ROCK REEF POINT,

419
00:18:22,732 --> 00:18:25,301
IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE
ROCK REEF SPEED BUMP.

420
00:18:25,301 --> 00:18:27,203
THAT TYPE OF ROCK IS
VERY HARD TO WORK
WITH, HAROLD.

421
00:18:27,203 --> 00:18:29,239
WE HAD SIR CHARLES TUPPER
JUST ABOUT COMPLETELY DONE,

422
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:31,174
AND THEN WE KNOCKED OFF
A REAL IMPORTANT BIT,

423
00:18:31,174 --> 00:18:33,810
AND NOW HE'S
MARGARET TRUDEAU.

424
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,912
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T
TRY DOING SO MANY,

425
00:18:35,912 --> 00:18:37,947
YOU KNOW, JUST STICK WITH
THE ONE YOU GOT ON THE
VERY END THERE,

426
00:18:37,947 --> 00:18:39,916
THAT LOOKS JUST
LIKE JOHN DIEFENBAKER.

427
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,018
THAT'S ANNE MURRAY.

428
00:18:42,018 --> 00:18:43,086
REALLY?

429
00:18:43,086 --> 00:18:46,122
BOY, SHE'S LET
HERSELF GO.

430
00:18:46,122 --> 00:18:49,726
I DON'T THINK WORKS OF ART
SHOULD BE THIS HARD.

431
00:18:49,726 --> 00:18:51,227
ARE WE DOING SOMETHING
WRONG, HAROLD?

432
00:18:51,227 --> 00:18:53,363
OH YES, ALWAYS.

433
00:18:53,363 --> 00:18:55,732
I THINK YOU SHOULD GET THE
PROPER EQUIPMENT AND THE
PROPER MATERIALS.

434
00:18:55,732 --> 00:18:57,901
YOU KNOW, OFTENTIMES WHEN
PEOPLE ARE DOING SCULPTURES,

435
00:18:57,901 --> 00:19:00,670
IT'S BEST IF THOSE PEOPLE
KNOW HOW TO, SAY, SCULPT,

436
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,572
LIKE, SAY,
A SCULPTOR.

437
00:19:02,572 --> 00:19:04,441
HAROLD, YOU TAKE THE
FUN OUT OF EVERYTHING.

438
00:19:04,441 --> 00:19:07,610
NO, I TAKE THE DANGER.
THAT'S WHAT
I JUST SAID.

439
00:19:09,612 --> 00:19:12,415

THEY'LL JUST TAKE THE
