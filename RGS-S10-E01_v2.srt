00:06:54,646 --> 00:06:58,417
WELL, I'D PRETEND I FORGOT
THE THING WAS IN MY POCKET.

HI, WINSTON ROTHSCHILD HERE

163
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:18,603
OF ROTHSCHILD'S SEWAGE AND
SEPTIC SUCKING SERVICES.

164
00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:21,340
IF YOU'RE DOWN IN THE DUMPS
BECAUSE YOU'RE LAWN'S
FULL OF LUMPS,

165
00:07:21,373 --> 00:07:24,509
CALL ME, WINSTON, AND I'LL BE
THERE WITH MY PUMPS.

[ APPLAUSE AND LAUGHTER ]

00:07:28,613 --> 00:07:31,216
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE MAJOR
CHALLENGES THAT FACES ANY
HANDYMAN IS...

168
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:33,185
HOW CAN YOU HAVE SOME OF
THE LUXURIES IN LIFE

169
00:07:33,251 --> 00:07:35,153
THAT YOU KNOW YOU
REALLY CAN'T AFFORD,

170
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:37,022
LIKE, SAY, A SNOWMOBILE?

171
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,391
WELL, YOU KNOW THE VALUE AND
BEAUTY OF A SNOWMOBILE,

172
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:42,060
BUT MAYBE YOUR WIFE IS A
LITTLE RELUCTANT TO LET YOU
SPEND MONEY ON ANYTHING

173
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:44,930
UNTIL YOU FINISH PAYING OFF
THAT HOVERCRAFT.

174
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:46,631
SO THIS TIME ON
HANDYMAN CORNER,

175
00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:48,733
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU HOW YOU
CAN MAKE YOUR OWN DARNED
SNOWMOBILE

176
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,504
OUT OF WATER SKIS, A TOBOGGAN,
A FEW ARTIFICIAL FIRE LOGS

177
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:54,873
AND A HOT WATER HEATER.

178
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:58,043
THIS HERE IS REALLY
THE ENGINE FOR THE UNIT.

179
00:07:58,076 --> 00:07:59,611
IT'S A ROCKET ENGINE.

180
00:07:59,678 --> 00:08:01,646
IT'S A STEAM ROCKET ENGINE.

181
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,615
I BET WITH A 50-GALLON
YOU COULD GO 60,

182
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:06,084
BUT THAT WOULD
JUST BE SHOWING OFF.

183
00:08:06,384 --> 00:08:10,088
OKAY, FIRST THING YOU WANNA
DO IS PUNCH A HOLE IN THE
END OF HER HERE.

184
00:08:10,155 --> 00:08:11,423
SOMEWHERE UP HIGH.

185
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,624
THAT'S YOUR STEAM PORT, EH?

186
00:08:12,691 --> 00:08:13,992
THAT'S WHERE THE
STEAM'S GONNA COME OUT,

187
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:15,360
SO YOU GOTTA KEEP
THE HOLE HIGH,

188
00:08:15,393 --> 00:08:17,329
OTHERWISE THE WATER'LL
ALL LEAK OUT.

189
00:08:17,362 --> 00:08:19,030
RIGHT IN HERE.

190
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,501
OH, MAN.

191
00:08:23,535 --> 00:08:24,803
NOW, WAIT NOW.

192
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:26,705
I GOT AN IDEA.

193
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:28,974
A HANDYMAN NEVER PANICS.

194
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:33,378
A PROBLEM IS JUST AN
OPPORTUNITY WAITING TO HAPPEN.

195
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:36,481
LAY THAT IN THERE.

196
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:38,316
MAKE A LITTLE ADJUSTMENT.

197
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:43,321
PERFECT.

198
00:08:43,388 --> 00:08:46,124
NOW, YOU WANNA ATTACH THE
POWER PLANT TO THE TOBOGGAN.

199
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:48,460
AND YOU GOTTA HAVE SOMETHING
THAT WILL HOLD EVERYTHING
TOGETHER,

200
00:08:48,526 --> 00:08:50,962
PLUS BE ABLE TO ABLE TO
WITHSTAND THE SHOCK
OF A SKI JUMP,

COMMENTS OF NEIGHBOURS.

202
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:57,569
I RECOMMEND THE HANDYMAN'S
SECRET WEAPON, DUCT TAPE.

203
00:08:59,304 --> 00:09:02,040
ALL RIGHT, THESE ARTIFICIAL
LOGS ARE BASICALLY MY
ROCKET FUEL.

204
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:03,508
THEY BURN FOR
SIX HOURS, YOU KNOW,

205
00:09:03,575 --> 00:09:06,077
WHICH WILL GET ME ALL THE WAY
TO PORT ASBESTOS AND BACK.

206
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:08,980
IF I WAS ONLY GOING ONE WAY,
I'D CUT 'EM IN HALF.

207
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:10,515
I LIKE USING THE
ARTIFICIAL LOGS, THOUGH,

208
00:09:10,548 --> 00:09:12,550
BECAUSE THEY LIGHT UP
NO PROBLEM,

209
00:09:12,584 --> 00:09:14,152
AND THEY GIVE OFF THOSE
COLOURED FLAMES.

210
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:16,654
A LOT EASIER FOR THE
RESCUE PLANES TO SPOT.

211
00:09:16,988 --> 00:09:18,656
OKAY, THAT'S THE POWER
PLANT DONE ON HER.

212
00:09:18,723 --> 00:09:21,659
THIS BABY'LL GO FASTER THAN A
TEENAGER'S ALLOWANCE.

00:09:21,726 --> 00:09:23,695
NOW ALL WE GOTTA DO
IS ADD THE STEERING,

214
00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:27,665

ON THE FRONT WEARING A PAIR
OF WATER SKIS.

THINGS YOU SAID ABOUT MEN
AND SAUSAGES

461
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:24,747
WERE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.

462
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,415
AND LET'S JUST
LEAVE IT THERE.

463
00:21:26,449 --> 00:21:28,117
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

464
00:21:28,184 --> 00:21:30,953
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND THE
WHOLE GANG UP HERE AT
POSSUM LODGE,

465
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,488
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

466
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:34,991
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

467
00:21:37,994 --> 00:21:39,095
Dalton: EVERYBODY SIT DOWN.
SIT DOWN.

468
00:21:39,161 --> 00:21:40,296
SIT.

469
00:21:40,363 --> 00:21:41,564
Mike: SIT DOWN, EVERYBODY.

470
00:21:41,631 --> 00:21:42,999
EVERYBODY SIT DOWN.

471
00:21:43,065 --> 00:21:44,700
SIT DOWN, GUYS.

472
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:48,704
ALL RISE.

473
00:21:51,707 --> 00:21:55,678
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI.

474
00:21:57,313 --> 00:22:00,750
Red: ALL RIGHT, BOW YOUR HEADS
FOR THE MAN'S PRAYER.

475
00:22:00,783 --> 00:22:02,885
All: I'M A MAN,
BUT I CAN CHANGE,

476
00:22:02,952 --> 00:22:05,655
IF I HAVE TO,
I GUESS.

477
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,392
Red: OKAY, GUYS, I KNOW YOU'RE
ALL DISAPPOINTED

478
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,694
ABOUT THE SAUSAGE
CARNIVAL AND SO ON,

479
00:22:11,761 --> 00:22:14,530
BUT, UH, WINSTON HAS A LITTLE
BIT OF GOOD NEWS FOR US.

480
00:22:14,563 --> 00:22:16,132
Winston: WELL, UH, GUYS,

481
00:22:16,165 --> 00:22:18,734
AS YOU KNOW, OUR SAUSAGE DIDN'T
REALLY IMPRESS THE JUDGES,

482
00:22:18,801 --> 00:22:21,037
BUT IT SCORED A HIT WITH
THE CARIBOU LODGE.

483
00:22:22,304 --> 00:22:24,540
A DIRECT HIT!
