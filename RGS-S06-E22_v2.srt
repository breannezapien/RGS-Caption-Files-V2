1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,339
STARRING THE OLD RED GREEN.

2
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:09,576
HERE HE IS, POSSUM LODGE'S
SELF-MADE MAN

3
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:13,747
WITH NO WARRANTY --
YOUR HERO, MY UNCLE, RED GREEN!

4
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:15,949
(Applause and cheering)

5
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:18,918
THANK YOU! THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

6
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:21,521
APPRECIATE IT -- THANK YOU.

7
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:23,556
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

8
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:25,525
DID YOU HURT YOUR NECK

9
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:26,860
OR DID YOU GO

10
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:28,795
TO DON CHERRY'S TAILOR?

11
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,364
I HAD
AN ACCIDENT ON MY BIKE.

12
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,566
I WAS RIDING DOWN HOLLER HILL.

13
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:34,934
JUNIOR SINGLETON

14
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:36,503
PULLED HIS VEGA OVER

15
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,838
TO ANSWER A CALL OF NATURE.

16
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:43,076
NATURE MUST HAVE BEEN YELLING,
'CAUSE HE DIDN'T SEE ME.

17
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,211
I WENT WHAM! INTO HIS DOOR!

18
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:47,080
MY INSURANCE AGENCY SAYS

19
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,349
I SHOULD TAKE LEGAL ACTION.

20
00:00:49,415 --> 00:00:52,185
SO I'M GONNA SUE
JUNIOR SINGLETON

21
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,387
FOR EVERYTHING HE'S WORTH!

22
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:55,889
$50,000!

23
00:00:55,955 --> 00:01:00,793
HAROLD, THAT'S EVERYTHING
HE'S WORTH... PLUS $50,000!

24
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,732
(Horns honking)

25
00:01:05,798 --> 00:01:08,334
(Geese honking)

26
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:11,838
(Quacking)

27
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,676
(Red): YOU'RE LOOKIN'
AT SEGMENTS

28
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,078
FROM THIS PARTICULAR SHOW,

29
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:20,446
THE MAIN MESSAGE BEING,

30
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:23,082
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT CHANGING THE CHANNEL.

31
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:25,752
TO MAKE SENSE
OUT OF THIS PROGRAMME,

32
00:01:25,818 --> 00:01:27,086
YOU GOTTA GIVE IT

33
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:28,855
YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.

34
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:39,032
FOR THOSE AT HOME ADJUSTING
THE SOUND ON YOUR T.V.,

35
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:40,566
YOU HEARD RIGHT.

36
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:43,836
HAROLD IS SUING
JUNIOR SINGLETON FOR $50,000.

37
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:46,506
HOPE YOU HAVEN'T
HIRED A LAWYER.

38
00:01:46,572 --> 00:01:48,307
HA-HA! NO!

39
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,109
I'M REPRESENTING MYSELF.

40
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,979
I DON'T HAVE A LAW DEGREE
BUT I'VE READ

41
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,915
EVERY JOHN GRISHAM NOVEL
SO I'LL BE OK.

42
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:58,618
ABRAHAM LINCOLN SAID
PEOPLE WHO ACT

43
00:01:58,684 --> 00:02:01,454
AS THEIR OWN LAWYER

44
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:05,258
HAVE A FOOL FOR A LAWYER
AND AN ASS FOR A CLIENT.

45
00:02:05,324 --> 00:02:08,961
OUR COUNTRY'S ONLY AS STRONG
AS ITS LEGAL SYSTEM.

46
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:10,296
IT'S LIKE A MUSCLE.

47
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,899
IF YOU DON'T USE IT,
IT GETS OUT OF SHAPE.

48
00:02:12,965 --> 00:02:15,802
WHEN YOU USE IT,
YOU GET THIS HUMONGOUS CRAMP.

49
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:18,704
YOU SPEND GYM CLASS
HUDDLED AROUND THE TOILET.

50
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,072
(Audience laughing)

51
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:22,708
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU'RE SUING JUNIOR.

52
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,343
HE DOESN'T HAVE MONEY.

53
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,546
I'LL PUT A LIEN ON HIS HOUSE.

54
00:02:26,612 --> 00:02:29,348
ANY MORE "LEAN"
AND SHE'LL FALL OVER.

55
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:32,251
I'M PROVING
TO THE PEOPLE OF POSSUM LAKE

56
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,387
THAT YOU CAN SETTLE DISPUTES

57
00:02:34,453 --> 00:02:37,523
WITHOUT THROWING VEGETABLES
OR DEFLATING TIRES

58
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,593
OR LEAVING FLAMING BAGS
OF MANURE ON PORCHES.

59
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,129
I SAID I WAS SORRY.

60
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,565
WRECKED MY BEST SHOES.

61
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:47,033
SUE ME!

62
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,068
WAHAHH! I WILL!

63
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,770
(Red): HERE THEY ARE.

64
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:54,507
EACH HAS A HALF
OF MOOSE THOMPSON'S HALTER TOP.

65
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,042
OH, BOY... OH, MAN.

66
00:02:56,108 --> 00:02:57,843
THEY'RE DOING GLIDING.

67
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,680
REMEMBER WHEN YOU HAD
THOSE GLIDERS?

68
00:03:00,746 --> 00:03:02,582
HAD A LOT OF FUN... OH!

69
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:04,083
(Laughing)

70
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,119
THE FUN YOU CAN HAVE...
OH, BY GOLLY.

71
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,755
YEAH, IT'S SO SIMPLE,
SOMETIMES,

72
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:12,558
THE MOST ENJOYABLE
THINGS IN LIFE.

73
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,594
FUN, FUN, FUN, EH? YEAH!

74
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,095
(Laughing)

75
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:17,763
BOY, I'M ENJOYING THIS.

76
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,098
THIS IS A STEP UP.

77
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:22,068
THESE ARE THE KIND,
YOU WIND UP THE PROP.

78
00:03:22,134 --> 00:03:23,469
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

79
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,071
GOT THE ELASTIC THERE.

80
00:03:25,137 --> 00:03:27,606
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
HIGH-TECH STUFF.

81
00:03:27,673 --> 00:03:30,309
ELECTRIC DRILL, THERE,
AND HE'S...

82
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,678
HE'S REALLY BEEN WORKING OUT.

83
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:36,916
EITHER THAT, OR THE BLADE
IS MADE OF SOLDER, PERHAPS.

84
00:03:36,982 --> 00:03:39,618
THAT'S GONNA WORK GREAT,
ISN'T IT, EH?

85
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:41,354
GONNA WORK GREAT.

86
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,157
WE'LL CHECK ON THEM LATER
AFTER THEY SMARTEN UP!

87
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:48,527
IF YOU FIND YOURSELF
LOOKIN' FOR A FAMILY PET

88
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:50,563
I'D SAY
GET YOURSELF A HOG

89
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:54,200
THEY'RE SMART AND FRIENDLY
AND THEY WON'T RUN AWAY

90
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:57,069
AND THEY'RE EASIER TO TRAIN
THAN A DOG

91
00:03:57,136 --> 00:04:00,539
AND WHEN THE TIME COMES
WHEN A DOG PASSES ON

92
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:03,109
YOU'LL FIND
YOUR HEART IS ACHIN'

93
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:06,045
BUT THE PAIN OF LOSIN'
A HOG IS EASED

94
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,581
BY THE BONUS
OF ALL THAT BACON

95
00:04:08,647 --> 00:04:11,217
(Imitating
pig squealing)

96
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:12,918
WELCOME TO THE WORD GAME!

97
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:14,520
TONIGHT'S PRIZE IS FROM

98
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,556
THE WE-POLL-IT
TELEPHONE SOLICITATION COMPANY

99
00:04:17,623 --> 00:04:19,692
WHO WILL PHONE YOU
AT DINNERTIME

100
00:04:19,758 --> 00:04:21,193
TO ASK YOU QUESTIONS.

101
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,696
YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO GET MIKE HAMAR

102
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:25,598
TO SAY THIS WORD.

103
00:04:25,664 --> 00:04:27,099
"BED".

104
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,268
(Laughing)

105
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,103
"BED."

106
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:38,110
(Audience laughing)

107
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,112
ALL RIGHT, UH...

108
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:41,647
MIKE.

109
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:44,049
AT NIGHT, YOU SLEEP IN A...

110
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:45,384
... CELL.

111
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,721
BUT YOU LIE THERE IN A...

112
00:04:48,787 --> 00:04:50,789
... COLD SWEAT.

113
00:04:50,856 --> 00:04:53,559
YOU LIE ON A...

114
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,060
... COT.

115
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:57,162
BUNK...
CEMENT FLOOR.

116
00:04:57,229 --> 00:04:59,198
YOUR MATTRESS FITS ON

117
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:01,367
A QUEEN-SIZED...
... CELL-MATE.

118
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:08,707
(Audience laughing)

119
00:05:08,774 --> 00:05:10,743
AFTER YOU MADE PAROLE,

120
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:12,578
YOU SLEPT IN
A WARM, DRY...

121
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,213
... DUMPSTER.

122
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,716
OK, NO, ALL RIGHT,
IF YOU'D GONE HOME,

123
00:05:17,783 --> 00:05:20,085
YOUR MOM WOULD LET YOU SLEEP
INOUR...

124
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:21,420
... DUMPSTER.

125
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,589
WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME.

126
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,258
OK, THERE'S AN
EXPRESSION, OK?

127
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:27,993
YOU MADE
YOUR SOMETHING.

128
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,762
NOW YOU HAVE TO
LAY IN IT.

129
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:31,363
I GET IT -- "GETAWAY"!

130
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,934
OK, YOU TRIED YOUR GETAWAY BUT
THE ESCAPE ROUTE WAS BLOCKED

131
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:37,269
SO YOU HID
UNDER...

132
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:38,637
... HER BED.

133
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:40,139
YEAH!

134
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:42,107
(Ringing bell)

135
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:44,243
THIS WEEK ON "HANDYMAN CORNER",

136
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:47,079
I'LL TALK ABOUT
WINTERIZING YOUR VEHICLE.

137
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:49,148
IF YOU'RE ANYTHING LIKE ME --

138
00:05:49,214 --> 00:05:51,784
AND IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW,
YOU ARE --

139
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,585
YOUR VEHICLE IS SUFFERING

140
00:05:53,652 --> 00:05:56,155
FROM WHAT I CALL
RECEDING TREAD-LINE.

141
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:57,523
(Audience laughing)

142
00:05:57,589 --> 00:05:59,124
MALE-PATTERN TIRE WEAR.

143
00:05:59,191 --> 00:06:02,694
WE GOT SPACE-AGE TECHNOLOGY,
PUT A MAN ON THE MOON.

144
00:06:02,761 --> 00:06:04,463
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET

145
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,432
A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND MILES
OUT OF A TIRE.

146
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:09,568
I SAY YOU CAN -- LOOK AT THIS.

147
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,436
WE'RE NOT OUT OF RUBBER.

148
00:06:11,503 --> 00:06:13,338
WE'RE JUST OUT OF TREAD.

149
00:06:13,405 --> 00:06:15,174
BEING A RETREAD MYSELF,

150
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,177
I SAY LET'S CUT OURSELVES
A NEW GROOVE.

151
00:06:18,243 --> 00:06:21,814
GET YOURSELF ONE OF THEM
AUTOMOTIVE MAGAZINES,

152
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,751
PICK OUT A TREAD PATTERN
THAT SUITS YOUR LIFESTYLE.

153
00:06:25,817 --> 00:06:29,087
THEN PLUG IN YOUR ROUTER
AND START ROUTIN'.

154
00:06:29,154 --> 00:06:32,524
I GET MY KICKS ON "ROUT" 66.

155
00:06:40,165 --> 00:06:43,535
(Coughing)

156
00:06:43,602 --> 00:06:46,138
MAN! SMELLS LIKE I DROVE
THE INDY 500

157
00:06:46,204 --> 00:06:48,206
WITH THE EMERGENCY BRAKE ON.

158
00:06:48,273 --> 00:06:51,710
I WAS HAVING SOME PROBLEMS
FOLLOWING THE PATTERN.

159
00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:54,112
HARDER THAN
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

160
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:56,548
I'VE DONE
A TOTAL RE-THINK ON 'ER.

161
00:06:56,615 --> 00:06:58,550
(Banging)

162
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:01,386
WHAT I'VE GOT NOW
IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

163
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:03,055
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS.

164
00:07:03,121 --> 00:07:04,756
PERSONALIZED SNOW TIRES.

165
00:07:04,823 --> 00:07:07,492
SEE THAT?
NOT JUST A FASHION STATEMENT.

166
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:09,895
IT ACTUALLY PROVES
WHERE YOU WERE,

167
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,563
IF THE COPS SHOULD ASK.

168
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,999
NOT JUST A TIRE --
IT'S AN ALIBI...

169
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,101
HOPEFULLY, AN AIRTIGHT ALIBI.

170
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:19,571
OR MAYBE YOU'RE THE KIND
OF PERSON WHO GETS LOST.

171
00:07:19,638 --> 00:07:21,006
HOW ABOUT THIS UNIT?

172
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,941
GOT ARROWS CARVED INTO 'ER.

173
00:07:23,008 --> 00:07:26,044
YOU MOUNT THESE
SO THE ARROWS ARE BACKWARDS.

174
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:29,581
NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO,
YOU'LL FIND YOUR WAY HOME.

175
00:07:29,648 --> 00:07:33,118
MAYBE YOU GOT A GIRLFRIEND
YOU'RE TRYING TO IMPRESS.

176
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:36,221
WHO ISN'T, HUH?
EVEN SOME OF YOU MARRIED GUYS.

177
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:38,390
HOW ABOUT THIS? "I LOVE TRUDY".

178
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:39,825
ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL?

179
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:41,693
IF YOU BREAK UP WITH TRUDY,

180
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,862
JUST PEEL RUBBER
FOR A FEW MILES.

181
00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:47,132
YOU'LL ERASE HER OFF
YOUR RADIALS AND YOUR LIFE.

182
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,136
HERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL
I'M WORKING ON FOR MY WIFE.

183
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:52,838
A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR HER.

184
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:55,841
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

185
00:07:55,907 --> 00:07:58,110
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

186
00:07:58,176 --> 00:07:59,711
I'M GONNA DOT THAT "I".

187
00:08:03,615 --> 00:08:07,018
I'LL USE THAT ONE AS A SPARE.

188
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:11,223
STAY TUNED -- WHATEVER THIS IS,
WE GOT LOTS MORE OF IT.

189
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,095
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM
YOU KIDS GOT

190
00:08:17,162 --> 00:08:19,498
IS "WHO AM I GONNA ASK
FOR ADVICE?"

191
00:08:19,564 --> 00:08:22,701
CAN'T GO TO YOUR DAD --
HE BOTCHES EVERYTHING.

192
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:26,538
HE BOUGHT THAT PACER, SAID
THAT WAS THE CAR OF THE FUTURE.

193
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:27,973
YOUR MOM'S TOO NICE.

194
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:31,176
SHE'LL TELL YOU
EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR.

195
00:08:31,243 --> 00:08:33,378
MAYBE YOU GOT AN OLDER BROTHER,

196
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:36,081
BUT HE'S SPENT FIVE YEARS
ON THE COUCH,

197
00:08:36,147 --> 00:08:38,183
SO HE HAS A DIFFERENT AGENDA.

198
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,684
IF YOU ASK ME,

199
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:43,188
YOU WANT THE RELATIVE
THAT DRIVES YOUR PARENTS CRAZY.

200
00:08:43,255 --> 00:08:44,689
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

201
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:47,158
NINE TIMES OUT OF 10,
IT'S AN UNCLE.

202
00:08:47,225 --> 00:08:48,927
UNCLES GIVE GREAT ADVICE.

203
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:50,629
GO FIND THAT UNCLE, SEE?

204
00:08:50,695 --> 00:08:53,965
HE PROBABLY THINKS
YOU'RE BEING RAISED BY MORONS

205
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:56,901
SO HE'S MOTIVATED
TO GIVE YOU GREAT ADVICE

206
00:08:56,968 --> 00:08:59,104
AND HE WANTS YOU TO DO IT WELL.

207
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,774
NOT ONLY WILL HE GET CREDIT
FOR DOING SOMETHING GOOD,

208
00:09:02,841 --> 00:09:04,976
HE'LL DRIVE YOUR PARENTS CRAZY.

209
00:09:05,043 --> 00:09:06,711
YOU SEEK OUT THAT UNCLE.

210
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:09,714
HE'S SMARTER THAN HE LOOKS.

211
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:11,282
HE'S GOTTA BE.

212
00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:15,186
YES, YOU CAN LEAVE THE ROOM.

213
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:17,222
PUT YOUR
ARM DOWN.

214
00:09:17,288 --> 00:09:18,623
WAHHHH!

215
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:22,127
WHAT A MESS THIS GUY'S CREATED.

216
00:09:22,193 --> 00:09:25,530
HE'S SUING JUNIOR FOR $50,000.

217
00:09:25,597 --> 00:09:28,133
$75,000! EVER SINCE
THE ACCIDENT,

218
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:29,834
MY ARM'S BEEN TINGLY.

219
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:33,671
MY UPPER BODY STRENGTH
ISN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE.

220
00:09:33,738 --> 00:09:35,407
IT WENT UP?

221
00:09:35,473 --> 00:09:37,442
MAN!

222
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:39,844
JUNIOR'S SUING BUSTER,
WHO HAD THE PARTY,

223
00:09:39,911 --> 00:09:43,114
HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO
AS THE PARTY OF THE FIRST PART.

224
00:09:43,181 --> 00:09:45,784
BUSTER IS SUING
"HUMPHREY'S EVERYTHING STORE"

225
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,352
FOR SELLING HIM THE COFFEE

226
00:09:47,418 --> 00:09:50,021
THAT CAUSED JUNIOR
TO HAVE TO RELIEVE HIMSELF

227
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:51,456
AND CAUSED THE ACCIDENT,

228
00:09:51,523 --> 00:09:54,692
HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO
AS WHAT THAT IDIOT HAROLD DID.

229
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:58,763
I DON'T THINK EVERYBODY
SHOULD BE MAD AT ME.

230
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,765
THEY'RE NOT MAD AT YOU.

231
00:10:00,832 --> 00:10:04,802
THEY'RE GONNA SUE EVERYBODY
AND USE YOU AS THEIR LAWYER.

232
00:10:04,869 --> 00:10:06,938
REALLY? OH, THAT'S EXCELLENT!

233
00:10:07,005 --> 00:10:08,439
I'D NEED A RETAINER.

234
00:10:08,506 --> 00:10:10,208
YOU'RE WEARING
A RETAINER.

235
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:13,745
RIGHT, OK... I'M GONNA NEED
A LEGAL POSITION ON THIS.

236
00:10:13,811 --> 00:10:15,413
I'M ADVISING EVERYBODY
TO PLEAD INSANITY.

237
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,849
THAT CAN BE DIFFICULT
TO SUBSTANTIATE.

238
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:22,186
PICKING YOU AS A LAWYER
IS ALL THE PROOF THEY NEED.

239
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,727
(Laughing)

240
00:10:29,794 --> 00:10:31,229
WHOA! OH!

241
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:32,730
HOLY MACKEREL!

242
00:10:32,797 --> 00:10:34,232
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE FINE.

243
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:36,234
OK.

244
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:37,735
(Laughing)

245
00:10:37,802 --> 00:10:42,206
WELCOME TO "AUTO BIOGRAPHY",
WHERE MEMBERS OF POSSUM LODGE

246
00:10:42,273 --> 00:10:45,243
TALK ABOUT REMEMBRANCES
OF CARS GONE BY.

247
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,211
GOT DOUGIE FRANKLIN HERE.

248
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:49,747
HOW MANY VEHICLES
HAVE YOU OWNED?

249
00:10:49,814 --> 00:10:51,249
13, 14...

250
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:52,750
100.

251
00:10:52,817 --> 00:10:54,419
THAT'S QUITE A FLEET.

252
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:57,088
YOU HAVE A FAVOURITE
OUT OF THAT PACK?

253
00:10:57,155 --> 00:11:00,158
I THINK MY FAVOURITE
WOULD HAVE TO BE

254
00:11:00,224 --> 00:11:03,461
MY METAL-FLAKE BLUE
1968 DODGE CHARGER.

255
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:05,930
METAL-FLAKE BLUE EXTERIOR...

256
00:11:05,997 --> 00:11:08,433
METAL-FLAKE BLUE INTERIOR...

257
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:12,003
METAL-FLAKE BLUE
TINTED WINDOWS.

258
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,938
WAS A BEAUTIFUL THING
TO BEHOLD.

259
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:16,941
WHEN YOU PUT YOUR PEDAL
TO THE METAL,

260
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:19,777
IT WOULD SNAP YOUR NECK
LIKE A TWIG

261
00:11:19,844 --> 00:11:22,280
AND YOUR HAIR WOULD END UP
IN THE BACK!

262
00:11:22,346 --> 00:11:23,715
(Laughing)

263
00:11:23,781 --> 00:11:26,717
THAT'S GOTTA REDUCE
THE RESALE VALUE.

264
00:11:26,784 --> 00:11:28,453
WAHHH... NOTHIN'.

265
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:32,857
YOU COULD BE DRIVIN' DOWN
THE MAIN STREET ON A GOOD NIGHT

266
00:11:32,924 --> 00:11:34,826
AND THAT ENGINE, SHE'D...

267
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:36,227
SHE'D JUST BE HUMMIN'.

268
00:11:36,294 --> 00:11:38,096
(Burbling)

269
00:11:38,162 --> 00:11:39,964
(Sputtering)

270
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:41,732
RACING CAM.

271
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,234
YEAH.

272
00:11:43,301 --> 00:11:44,735
OH, BOY.

273
00:11:44,802 --> 00:11:46,370
THEN I'D DO THAT THING.

274
00:11:46,437 --> 00:11:48,473
I'D PUT ONE FOOT ON THE BRAKE

275
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:51,209
AND THE OTHER ONE
ON THE ACCELERATOR...

276
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:53,744
THOSE BACK TIRES
WOULD BE SCREAMIN'!

277
00:11:53,811 --> 00:11:55,346
WHOO-HOO! WHOO-HOO!

278
00:11:55,413 --> 00:11:58,249
THEN I'D TAKE MY FOOT
OFF THE BRAKE

279
00:11:58,316 --> 00:12:00,251
AND SHE'D... WHOA!

280
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:01,919
FIRST GEAR!

281
00:12:01,986 --> 00:12:03,254
(Screaming)

282
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:04,589
SECOND GEAR!

283
00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:05,923
(Screaming)

284
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,259
THEN I'D... LOOK OUT!
PEDESTRIANS!

285
00:12:08,326 --> 00:12:10,761
(Screaming)

286
00:12:10,828 --> 00:12:12,763
THEN I'D HIT THE BRAKE!

287
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,832
(Screaming)

288
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:22,773
(Applause)

289
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,278
(Siren)

290
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,416
POSSUM 911 --
HOW CAN WE HELP YOU?

291
00:12:32,483 --> 00:12:34,986
I'VE FALLEN AND I CAN'T GET UP!

292
00:12:35,052 --> 00:12:36,320
THAT YOU,
DALTON?

293
00:12:36,387 --> 00:12:38,889
IT'S ME, DALTON HUMPHREY.

294
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:40,224
ANY BROKEN
BONES?

295
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,960
CAN YOU GET TO A PHONE?

296
00:12:43,027 --> 00:12:45,229
(Audience laughing)

297
00:12:45,296 --> 00:12:46,731
(Moaning)

298
00:12:46,797 --> 00:12:48,232
I'M FEELING FAINT.

299
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:49,900
I... I CAN'T BREATHE!

300
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:52,970
I GOT A PIANO ON MY CHEST!

301
00:12:53,037 --> 00:12:55,139
WELL, THERE'S
YOUR PROBLEM.

302
00:12:55,206 --> 00:12:59,710
YEAH, TRY AN ACCORDION ON
YOUR CHEST -- THEY'RE LIGHTER.

303
00:12:59,777 --> 00:13:02,813
NO, RED, MY WIFE
WAS GONNA HIRE MOVERS

304
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,384
TO DRAG THE PIANO UPSTAIRS,
AND, YOU KNOW...

305
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,420
I DON'T PAY PEOPLE
TO MOVE FURNITURE.

306
00:13:09,487 --> 00:13:11,889
LET ME GUESS --
YOUR WIFE WENT OUT,

307
00:13:11,956 --> 00:13:14,959
YOU FIGURED YOU COULD MOVE
THE PIANO YOURSELF.

308
00:13:15,025 --> 00:13:16,460
WELL, YEAH... UGH!

309
00:13:16,527 --> 00:13:19,597
OHHHH! I GOT IT
AS FAR AS THE FIRST LANDING.

310
00:13:19,663 --> 00:13:21,832
IT DIDN'T FIT
AROUND THE CORNER.

311
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:25,202
SORT OF LOST MY MOMENTUM AND...
OOOH! AND, UH...

312
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:27,772
WELL, WE CAME BACK DOWN AGAIN.

313
00:13:27,838 --> 00:13:31,509
NOW I'M PINNED AND
I CAN'T REACH THE PHONE BOOK.

314
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:33,444
WE GOT A PHONE
BOOK HERE.

315
00:13:33,511 --> 00:13:35,446
I COULD LOOK
SOMETHING UP.

316
00:13:35,513 --> 00:13:37,715
I COULD PHONE
SOMEBODY FOR YOU.

317
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:39,283
OH, THANKS, HAROLD.

318
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:43,454
CALL FIVE DIFFERENT PIANO
MOVERS AND GET ESTIMATES.

319
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:46,557
AND THEN CALL BACK
THE SECOND CHEAPEST

320
00:13:46,624 --> 00:13:49,894
AND SAY THE CHEAPEST
WILL DO IT FOR LESS.

321
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,996
"CAN YOU BEAT HIS PRICE?"

322
00:13:52,062 --> 00:13:56,667
THEN CALL THE CHEAPEST AND SAY
"CAN YOU GIVE ME A BREAK?"

323
00:13:56,734 --> 00:13:58,836
AND KEEP ARGUING 'EM DOWN.

324
00:13:58,903 --> 00:14:01,672
THEN TELL THE CHEAPEST

325
00:14:01,739 --> 00:14:04,275
AND GET THIS PIANO
OFF MY CHEST!

326
00:14:04,341 --> 00:14:07,278
YOU SHOULD CALL AN AMBULANCE
OR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT!

327
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:12,049
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT -- THEY'RE
BIG FELLAS, AREN'T THEY?

328
00:14:12,116 --> 00:14:14,151
PRETTY BIG,
SOME OF THEM.

329
00:14:14,218 --> 00:14:18,422
AND I PAY TAXES --
THEY'LL MOVE THIS FOR NOTHIN'!

330
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:20,925
(Red): MEANWHILE, THE BOYS

331
00:14:20,991 --> 00:14:23,394
ARE STILL WINDING THEIR...

332
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,895
... ELASTICS.

333
00:14:24,962 --> 00:14:27,197
BILL LIKES TO CRANK 'ER UP.

334
00:14:27,264 --> 00:14:28,699
(Laughing)

335
00:14:28,766 --> 00:14:30,200
OH, BILL.

336
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:32,202
COME ON, BILL, COME ON.

337
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:33,704

338
00:14:33,771 --> 00:14:35,205
YOU'LL GO BLIND.

339
00:14:35,272 --> 00:14:36,640

OH, YEAH, THAT WILL WORK GREAT.

341
00:14:39,543 --> 00:14:41,312
YOU KNOW WHAT, BILL?

342
00:14:41,378 --> 00:14:43,847
I WOULD SUGGEST
JUST A COUPLE MORE.

343
00:14:43,914 --> 00:14:45,349
ONE MORE? ALL RIGHT.

344
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,618
JUST ONE MORE -- THAT'S RIGHT.

345
00:14:47,685 --> 00:14:49,720
YOU CAN ALWAYS GET ONE MORE.

346
00:14:49,787 --> 00:14:51,221
(Laughing)

347
00:14:51,288 --> 00:14:53,223
BOY, THERE'S A SURPRISE.

348

349
00:14:54,925 --> 00:14:57,428
YOU TAKE YOUR FRIEND'S --

350
00:14:57,494 --> 00:14:59,363
HE'S GONNA CRANK THAT UP.

351
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,865
NOW HE'S PREPARED
TO LAUNCH THAT.

352
00:15:01,932 --> 00:15:04,234
THESE THINGS ARE SO REALISTIC.

353
00:15:04,301 --> 00:15:05,903
SETS 'ER DOWN AND...

354
00:15:05,969 --> 00:15:08,372
THE FLIGHT'S ALREADY DELAYED.

355
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:09,907
IT'S SO REALISTIC.

356
00:15:09,973 --> 00:15:12,543
OH, YOU'RE CLEARED
FOR TAKE-OFF!

357
00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:14,611
YOU CAN SHAVE WITH THAT.

363
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,056
SOME OF THESE MEN, THEY PANIC.

364
00:15:26,123 --> 00:15:28,192
COME ON, THAT'S NOT FAIR.

365
00:15:28,258 --> 00:15:30,027

00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:41,038
SUDDENLY, GLIDERS ARE COMING
FROM EVERYWHERE.

370
00:15:41,104 --> 00:15:44,107
I DON'T LIKE THE LOOK OF THIS.

371
00:15:44,174 --> 00:15:46,143
I DON'T LIKE THE FEEL OF THIS.

372
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,711
I'M GLAD I'M NOT THERE.

373
00:15:47,778 --> 00:15:49,913
GUYS? GUYS, YOU ALL RIGHT?

374
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,949
WHAT'S THAT? WHAT IS IT?

375
00:15:52,015 --> 00:15:53,550

379
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:00,724

AND WHO
REMEMBERS?

482
00:20:15,244 --> 00:20:17,280
NO ONE ON THIS PLANET!

483
00:20:17,347 --> 00:20:18,881
SO, MR.
SHAUGHNESSY,

484
00:20:18,948 --> 00:20:20,450
YOU WERE
IN MOVIES?

485
00:20:20,516 --> 00:20:25,021
YOU BREAK MY HEART WHEN YOU
HAVE TO EVEN ASK THAT QUESTION.

486
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:27,423
IT'S NOT EASY
FOR ME, EITHER.

487
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,093
I PLAYED THE FARMER IN "SHANE".

488
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,196
I PLAYED THE MAD BOMBER
IN "AIRPORT".

489
00:20:33,262 --> 00:20:35,465
WAIT A SEC, WAIT A SEC.

490
00:20:35,531 --> 00:20:38,534
I SAW THOSE MOVIES
AND THAT ACTOR...

491
00:20:38,601 --> 00:20:41,237
WELL, IT WASN'T
HAP SHAUGHNESSY,

492
00:20:41,304 --> 00:20:42,939
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

493
00:20:43,005 --> 00:20:46,609
THE STUDIO PUBLICIST
CALLED ME "VAN HEFLIN".

494
00:20:46,676 --> 00:20:51,047
(Audience laughing)

495
00:20:51,114 --> 00:20:52,381
VAN HEFLIN?

496
00:20:52,448 --> 00:20:53,716
YEAH.

497
00:20:53,783 --> 00:20:56,252
YOU WERE TALLER THEN,
WEREN'T YOU?

498
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:59,956
IF I REMEMBER RIGHT,
YOU HAD A DIFFERENT... FACE.

499
00:21:00,022 --> 00:21:02,291
JUST PART OF MY CRAFT, HAROLD.

500
00:21:02,358 --> 00:21:03,893
I DON'T WANT TO BRAG,

501
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,697
BUT NO LESS AN ACTOR
THAN CHARLTON HESTON TOLD ME

502
00:21:07,763 --> 00:21:09,599
THAT I COULD REALLY ACT.

503
00:21:09,665 --> 00:21:12,268
HE SAID THAT
WITH A STRAIGHT FACE,

504
00:21:12,335 --> 00:21:13,669
SO I'M CONVINCED.

505
00:21:13,736 --> 00:21:16,239
(Audience laughing)

506
00:21:16,305 --> 00:21:20,276
EVERYONE SETTLED THEIR CASES
OUT OF COURT, WHICH IS GOOD,

507
00:21:20,343 --> 00:21:23,346
'CAUSE WE COULDN'T AFFORD
TO BUILD A COURT.

508
00:21:23,412 --> 00:21:26,182
I WAS SUING MOOSE THOMPSON
FOR 30 GRAND.

509
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:29,685
WE SOLVED THAT --
HE GAVE ME BACK MY FISH FINDER.

510
00:21:29,752 --> 00:21:33,923
STINKY GAVE ME BACK MY DRILL
AND I GAVE HIM HIS GOOD BOOTS.

511
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,058
I WON MY SUIT AGAINST BUSTER.

512
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,994
WHAT SUIT IS THAT?

513
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,829
MY BATHING SUIT --
I WONDERED WHERE THAT WENT.

514
00:21:39,896 --> 00:21:41,831
SO EVERYBODY'S HAPPY.

515
00:21:41,897 --> 00:21:43,933
LAW AND ORDER
HAS BEEN RESTORED.

516
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,270
BUT WHAT ABOUT MY LAWSUIT
AGAINST THE TOWNSHIP

517
00:21:47,336 --> 00:21:48,971
AND JUNIOR AND MY MOM?

518
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:53,309
GOOD NEWS -- I GOT BACK YOUR
DIP NET AND THE VIDEO GAME.

519
00:21:53,376 --> 00:21:55,444
OK, EXCELLENT -- GOOD WORK.

520
00:21:55,511 --> 00:21:57,647
THIS SUING WAS A LOT OF FUN.

521
00:21:57,713 --> 00:22:01,283
MAYBE I'LL BE A LAWYER, 'CAUSE
EVERYBODY HATES ME ALREADY.

522
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,618
THAT WOULD BE OK.

523
00:22:02,685 --> 00:22:05,421
MAYBE I CAN GET ON
ONE OF THOSE BIG FIRMS,

524
00:22:05,488 --> 00:22:06,756
LIKE ON "L.A. LAW"

525
00:22:06,822 --> 00:22:09,091
OR "PERRY MASONRY"
OR I COULD BE

526
00:22:09,158 --> 00:22:12,995
A COOL CORPORATE LAWYER
LIKE IN THAT SHOW "TRADERS".

527
00:22:13,062 --> 00:22:14,597
(Laughing and applause)

528
00:22:14,664 --> 00:22:16,165
THAT'S COOL.

529
00:22:16,232 --> 00:22:18,667
(Possum squeal)

530
00:22:18,734 --> 00:22:20,102
SQUEAL
OF THE POSSUM!

531
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:22,171
IT'S MEETING
TIME, UNCLE RED.

532
00:22:22,238 --> 00:22:24,673
YOU GO AHEAD --
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

533
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,175
AWAY YOU GO.

534
00:22:26,242 --> 00:22:28,411
OHHH!

535
00:22:28,477 --> 00:22:29,945
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

536
00:22:30,012 --> 00:22:32,181
I'M COMING HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

537
00:22:32,248 --> 00:22:34,617
ALL THIS LEGAL STUFF
GOT ME THINKING.

538
00:22:34,683 --> 00:22:37,386
LATER, IF YOU PRESENT ME
WITH YOUR BRIEFS,

539
00:22:37,453 --> 00:22:39,555
I'LL PROBABLY RECOMMEND
A MERGER.

540
00:22:39,622 --> 00:22:41,056
THE REST OF YOU,

541
00:22:41,123 --> 00:22:44,827
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND HAROLD AND THE GANG,

542
00:22:44,894 --> 00:22:47,196
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

543
00:22:47,263 --> 00:22:49,932
(Applause)

544
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:51,433
(Possum squeal)

545
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,002
(Harold): OH, OK.

546
00:22:53,068 --> 00:22:55,271
STAND UP -- HE'S IN THE ROOM!

547
00:22:57,773 --> 00:23:01,210
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

548
00:23:01,277 --> 00:23:02,711
(Red): SIT DOWN.

549
00:23:02,778 --> 00:23:05,047
I HAVE A SERIOUS ANNOUNCEMENT.

550
00:23:05,114 --> 00:23:07,116
LAST NIGHT AT THE BANQUET,

551
00:23:07,183 --> 00:23:09,218
A BUNCH OF US WENT THROUGH

552
00:23:09,285 --> 00:23:10,819
400 GALLONS OF BEER.

553
00:23:10,886 --> 00:23:13,155
THIS MORNING, WHEN WE EMPTIED

554
00:23:13,222 --> 00:23:14,523
THE HOLDING TANK,

555
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:17,326
THERE WAS 500 GALLONS IN THERE.
