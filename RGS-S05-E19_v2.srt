00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:08,208
(Explosion)

2
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:11,044
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

(Applause and cheering)

7
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,191
(Whistling)

8
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:27,160
(Cheering)

9
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:28,661
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

10
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:29,863
VERY MUCH.

11
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:30,997
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

12
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,132
PRETTY EXCITING THIS WEEK.

13
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,901
IT APPEARS THAT
A VERY IMPORTANT, BIG VISITOR

14
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:37,403
IS DRIVING THROUGH
THE POSSUM LAKE AREA.

15
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,239
LET ME GUESS, LET ME GUESS,
LET ME GUESS!

16
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:42,342
UH, SUPERMODEL
CLAUDIA SCHIFFER.

17
00:00:42,408 --> 00:00:43,977
NO, IT'S NOT A PERSON.

18
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:44,978
IT'S A THING.

19
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,813
OH -- FABIO.

20
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,715
(Audience laughing)

21
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:50,016
NO, NO, NO, NO.

22
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,452
THE ROAD CREW'S
ON THE MAIN HIGHWAY.

23
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,153
THEY'RE WIDENING HER OUT

24
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,090
FOR A SUPER-TRANSPORT
CARRYING A BIG THING.

25
00:00:57,156 --> 00:00:59,058
WHAT'S THIS
BIG THING CALLED?

26
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,194
HAD LOTS OF Q's AND L's IN IT.

27
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,663
DOESN'T MATTER --
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

28
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,666
WHAT MATTERS IS,
IT'S A
 BIG THING.

29
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,068
THIS IS AN OCCASION
FOR ANY COMMUNITY.

30
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,104
THIS KIND OF THING
BONDS A TOWN,

31
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,439
BRINGS US ALL TOGETHER
FOR AN EVENT.

32
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:15,141
YOU'RE TALKING TAILGATE PARTY?

33
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,676
A KILLER.

34
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,244
(Audience laughing)

35
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:23,283
(Horns honking)

36
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,251
(Geese honking)

37
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,756
(Quacking)

38
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,094
(Red): WE GOT A GREAT SHOW
FOR YOU.

39
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:36,629
I'M PUMPED.

40
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:40,633
MIKE WILL TRY TO SAY
THE WORD "REMORSE".

41
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,637
SPEAKING OF SORRY THINGS,
RANGER GORD IS WITH US.

42
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,440
THERE'S A FUNNY THING
NEAR THE END OF THE SHOW.

43
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,713
AND BRING CHARCOAL --
RIGHT, BYE.

44
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,415
JUNIOR SINGLETON FOUND OUT

45
00:01:55,481 --> 00:01:59,018
THAT THIS BIG THING IS COMING
ON A CUSTOM-BUILT TRAILER.

46
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,554
THAT MEANS IT'S SPECIAL
AND REALLY BIG.

47
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,889
SO... SO WHAT?

48
00:02:02,955 --> 00:02:06,325
YOU'LL BE COOKING UP
YOUR FAMOUS TAILGATE HOT-DOGS?

49
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:09,062
NO, I WANT TO DO SOMETHING
KIND OF SPECIAL.

50
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:12,231
BUSTER HADFIELD THOUGHT
WE COULD HONOUR THE BIG THING

51
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,666
BY HAVING BIG FOOD.

52
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,435
BIG FOOD FOR BIG MOUTHS.

53
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:17,503
NO, BIG FOOD IS TOO OBVIOUS.

54
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,071
IT'S TOO ON THE NOSE.

55
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:22,141
AND ON THE FACE AND THE CHIN
AND THE LAP...

56
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,310
IT'S GONNA BE
QUITE A THING, HAROLD.

57
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:25,945
EVERYBODY'S ALL REVVED UP.

58
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,847
EVERYBODY'S EXCITED, YOU KNOW?

59
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,449
THE BARBER SHOP'S BOOKED.

60
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:31,551
WOMEN HAVE BOUGHT
NEW TRACK SUITS.

61
00:02:31,617 --> 00:02:34,086
(Audience laughing)

62
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:35,588
IT'S JUST A BIG THING.

63
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,623
WHY TURN EVERYTHING INTO
SUCH A...

64
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,958
... BIG THING?

65
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,326
YEAH!

66
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:43,663
HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED
YOU SHOULDN'T GO OUT THERE?

67
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:45,998
MAYBE IT'S FULL
OF TOXIC CHEMICALS.

68
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,500
THAT'S THE TICKET!

69
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,001
I'LL MAKE MY TAILGATE CHILI!

70
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,003
OHHHH!

71
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,505
(Applause)

72
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:55,975
(Red): BILL AND I WILL ASSEMBLE
A HIGH VIEWING STAND

73
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,477
SO HE CAN SIT
AND WATCH THE BIG THING.

74
00:02:58,544 --> 00:03:01,113
HE'D ASKED ME TO COME OVER
AND HELP HIM.

75
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,616
I THOUGHT THE VAN
WOULD COME IN HANDY.

76
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,951
SORRY, BILL.

77
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:06,786
HOPEFULLY, HE HAS
ANOTHER PLAN.

78
00:03:06,852 --> 00:03:08,254
HE NEEDS A MEDICAL PLAN.

79
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,723
OK, THIS IS THE BIG ONE!

80
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,959
FOR A PIZZA
WITH EVERYTHING ON IT,

81
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:15,628
COURTESY OF THE POSSUM LAKE
PETTING ZOO,

82
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,030
YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO GET MR. HAMAR

83
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:20,900
TO SAY THIS WORD.

84
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,269
THERE YOU GO --
30 SECONDS AND BEGIN.

85
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,937
UH, ALL RIGHT, MIKE.

86
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:27,773
WHEN YOU FEEL SORRY
FOR SOMETHING,

87
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,275
THAT MEANS YOU HAVE...

88
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:30,776
... BEEN
CAUGHT.

89
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:32,678
NO, UH...

90
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,014
HAVE YOU EVER FELT BAD
ABOUT SOMETHING?

91
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,050
UM... PATROL CAR...

92
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:39,685
UH, HOLDING CELL...

93
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,088
DON'T GUESS.
HANDCUFFS,
SOLITARY...

94
00:03:42,154 --> 00:03:44,223
MIKE, YOU'RE GETTING
ON MY NERVES.

95
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,559
OH, I'M SORRY, MR. GREEN.

96
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,261
YOU'RE SORRY --
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

97
00:03:49,328 --> 00:03:50,763
WHEN YOU'RE FEELING SORRY,

98
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,499
YOU GO TO THE PERSON
AND YOU SAY YOU HAVE...

99
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,967
... A PLEA BARGAIN.

100
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:56,535
(Audience laughing)

101
00:03:56,602 --> 00:03:58,671
YOU'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME.

102
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,072
I'M DOING
MY BEST.

103
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,241
NO, IT'S REALLY...
IT'S ME.

104
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,477
I'M JUST USELESS --
I CAN'T DO THIS.

105
00:04:04,543 --> 00:04:06,078
I'M A PIECE OF GARBAGE.

106
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,280
I-I-I'M EMBARRASSED,
I'M SO BAD.

107
00:04:08,347 --> 00:04:10,282
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M SO BAD...

108
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:13,986
MERE WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS
THE DISSATISFACTION I FEEL,

109
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,988
MY DYSPEPSIA...
(Harold):
YOU'RE WRONG.

110
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,023
IT'S ALL OVER.

111
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,525
MY REMORSE.

112
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,027
(Ringing bell)

113
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:23,529
AW, RIGHT ON!

114
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:24,497
OH, THAT WAS CLOSE!

115
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:25,865
(Applause)

116
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:26,599
(Strums acoustic guitar)

117
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:30,236
OH, THERE'S A HAPPY
WHISTLING IN THE AIR

118
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:32,805
EVERYTHING'S BRIGHT
AND CLEAR

119
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,040
YOU BURNED THE HAIR
OFF BOTH OF YOUR ARMS

120
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:37,877
AND THERE'S A PIECE MISSING
FROM THE TOP OF ONE EAR

121
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:40,212
WHILE YOU'RE WAITING
FOR THE AMBULANCE

122
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:43,649
YOU REVIEW
THE THINGS YOU DID

123
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,318
AND THE NEXT TIME
YOU START TO BARBECUE

124
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:48,988
YOU'LL REMEMBER
TO OPEN THE LID

125
00:04:49,054 --> 00:04:51,724
(Making
explosion sounds)

126
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,360
WITH THIS BIG THING
COMING THROUGH TOWN

127
00:04:54,426 --> 00:04:57,963
AND EVERYBODY GETTING OUT THERE
TO TAKE A BOO AT IT,

128
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,632
I'LL USE "HANDYMAN CORNER"

129
00:04:59,698 --> 00:05:03,068
TO SHOW HOW YOU CAN RISE
ABOVE THE CROWD... LITERALLY.

130
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:06,905
WHEN YOU GO TO PUBLIC EVENTS
LIKE A STOCK CAR RACE

131
00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:10,042
OR A MOCK LYNCHING
OR A POST OFFICE FIRE,

132
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:13,579
YOU DON'T WANT TO STAND
FOR MINUTES AT A TIME.

133
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:17,049
HOW DO YOU GET YOUR CHAIR
SIX FEET OFF THE GROUND?

134
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:20,019
YOU GET YOURSELF
SOME OF THESE INNER TUBES,

135
00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:23,489
LAY ONE DOWN ON THE FLOOR,
LAY ANOTHER ONE ON TOP,

136
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:25,958
AND ATTACH THEM,
USING RUBBER CEMENT

137
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,527
OR ELASTIC CORD OR --
THAT'S RIGHT --

138
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:32,364
THE HANDYMAN'S
SECRET WEAPON, DUCT TAPE.

139
00:05:32,431 --> 00:05:36,702
ONCE YOU GOT THE DUCT TAPE ON,
TAKE ONE OF THE INNER TUBES,

140
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,971
STICK HER RIGHT ON TOP, THERE.

141
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:43,342
YOU WANNA MAKE SURE
THAT YOU LINE THE VALVES UP.

142
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,978
THEN YOU GRAB ANOTHER ONE.

143
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,479
PUT IT RIGHT ON THERE.

144
00:05:47,546 --> 00:05:50,549
AS I SAY,
GET THOSE VALVES ALIGNED,

145
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:52,484
AND GRAB ANOTHER ONE.

146
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:55,988
SAME DEAL, SAME
"NOTHING NEW HERE".

147
00:05:56,054 --> 00:05:57,990
PUSH THAT DOWN.

148
00:05:58,056 --> 00:06:00,225
AND NOW YOU TAKE YOUR CHAIR...

149
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,996
PUT THAT RIGHT ON TOP.

150
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:06,498
SEAL THAT UP.

151
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:08,000
ALL RIGHT.

152
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:09,768
SIT DOWN AND START PUMPING.

153
00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:12,004
YOU'LL GET
A WHOLE NEW PERSPECTIVE.

154
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,572
NOW...

155
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:18,010
(Grunting)

156
00:06:18,076 --> 00:06:19,511
ALL RIGHT.

157
00:06:19,578 --> 00:06:21,013
THAT'S GOT HER.

158
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:24,016
WE'LL JUST DISCONNECT
THAT ONE...

159
00:06:24,082 --> 00:06:26,518
AND HOOK THE HOSE
ONTO THE NEXT...

160
00:06:26,585 --> 00:06:28,520
(Air escaping)

161
00:06:28,587 --> 00:06:31,023
I COULD PROBABLY
STAND UP AND DO THIS.

162
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:32,524
NO, THERE, WE GOT HER.

163
00:06:32,591 --> 00:06:34,092
PUMP UP THE NEXT TUBE.

164
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:38,030
(Grunting)

165
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:40,032
OK, OK, YEAH, OK.

166
00:06:40,098 --> 00:06:42,134
YOU SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT OF THIS.

167
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,569
SEE WHAT'S WRONG HERE?

168
00:06:43,635 --> 00:06:47,606
YOU SHOULD HAVE STARTED PUMPING
THE BOTTOM INNER TUBE FIRST.

169
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,107
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

170
00:06:49,174 --> 00:06:53,478
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE THE AIR OUT,
START ALL OVER AGAIN.

171
00:07:05,624 --> 00:07:07,059
(Grunting)

172
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,060
AND DONE!

173
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:09,394
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

174
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:11,363
I'LL BE ABLE TO SEE EVERYTHING.

175
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,432
NOTHING'S GONNA GET IN MY WAY.

176
00:07:13,498 --> 00:07:15,500
I'M LOOKING OVER
PEOPLE'S HEADS.

177
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:16,835
I'LL SEE FOR MILES.

178
00:07:16,902 --> 00:07:18,670
I'M UP HERE, COMFY AS HECK.

179
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:20,205
CAN EVEN PEEL A SNACK

180
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:22,808
WHILE I'M WAITING
FOR THE BIG THING.

181
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:25,510
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

182
00:07:25,577 --> 00:07:27,612
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

183
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:29,481
OH!

184
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:31,516
UH-OH!

185
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,018
OOH!

186
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,353
OHHHH!

187
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,024
THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE HERE.

188
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,293
KEEP MOVING... OHHHH!

189
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:42,861
STAY TUNED -- I PROVE

190
00:07:42,928 --> 00:07:45,530
THERE'S NOTHING FUNNY
ABOUT BEING AFRAID OF SPIDERS.

191
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:50,702
JUNIOR SINGLETON HEARD

192
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:54,039
THAT THE BIG THING
IS LESS THAN 24 HOURS AWAY.

193
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,975
THE BEST VIEW WILL BE
FROM LOVERS' LEAP.

194
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:58,743
THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY THOUGHT.

195
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,212
HALF THE TOWN'S UP THERE.

196
00:08:00,278 --> 00:08:02,781
THE WEIGHT WAS SO MUCH,
THE CLIFF COLLAPSED.

197
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:04,816
(Audience laughing)

198
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:08,720
LOVERS' LEAP
IS NOW LOVERS' LUMP.

199
00:08:08,787 --> 00:08:12,424
I'LL GO TO THAT HILL JUST TO
THE WEST OF DALTON'S PLACE.

200
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:14,793
YOU KNOW THE... THE...
THE CEMETERY.

201
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,461
NO, THAT'S PACKED, TOO.

202
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:20,832
INSTEAD OF A TAILGATE PARTY, IT
LOOKS LIKE A TOMBSTONE PARTY.

203
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:24,035
LOOKS LIKE THE DEAD HAVE RISEN
AND ARE PICNICKING.

204
00:08:24,102 --> 00:08:26,371
THERE'S STILL ROOM
BY THE MAUSOLEUM.

205
00:08:26,438 --> 00:08:28,874
FINE, I MAY NOT HAVE
THE BEST VIEW,

206
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,643
BUT I'LL HAVE
THE BEST TAILGATE PARTY.

207
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,578
DID YOU BUY TICKETS
FOR THE BIG-THING POOL?

208
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:34,913
WHAT CAN YOU BET ON?

209
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,249
HOW MANY PEOPLE
WILL GET FOOD POISONING

210
00:08:37,315 --> 00:08:39,084
BEFORE THE BIG THING ARRIVES?

211
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:43,054
NO, HAROLD, WE'RE BETTING
ON THE NUMBER OF TIRES.

212
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:46,057
I UNDERSTAND IT WEIGHS
30,000 POUNDS.

213
00:08:46,124 --> 00:08:48,893
A NORMAL TIRE'S
30 POUNDS PRESSURE.

214
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,396
I'M GUESSING A THOUSAND TIRES.

215
00:08:51,463 --> 00:08:52,897
EXCELLENT REASONING.

216
00:08:52,964 --> 00:08:54,599
I'M GONNA MAKE MONEY.

217
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,001
WELL, I DEFINITELY WILL.

218
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:57,335
I'M GONNA VIDEOTAPE IT.

219
00:08:57,402 --> 00:08:59,404
IT'S GONNA BE
A COMMEMORATIVE VIDEO.

220
00:08:59,471 --> 00:09:01,706
IT'S GONNA BE
THE ULTIMATE SOUVENIR.

221
00:09:01,773 --> 00:09:03,842
YOU SAID THE BIG THING
WAS STUPID

222
00:09:03,908 --> 00:09:05,910
AND MEANINGLESS AND IRRELEVANT.

223
00:09:05,977 --> 00:09:08,413
IT IS -- IT'S PERFECT
FOR TELEVISION.

224
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,216
(Audience laughing)

225
00:09:11,282 --> 00:09:12,684
HI, RANGER GORD AGAIN.

226
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:15,020
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
THAT A FOREST FIRE

227
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:17,889
IS A NATURAL PART
OF A FOREST'S EVOLUTION.

228
00:09:17,956 --> 00:09:20,825
IT CLEARS THE UNDERBRUSH,
AND IS THE ONLY WAY

229
00:09:20,892 --> 00:09:23,428
MANY CONIFEROUS TREES
CAN START TO GROW.

230
00:09:23,495 --> 00:09:27,665
MY JOB AS A FOREST RANGER IS
TO PREVENT FOREST FIRES.

231
00:09:27,732 --> 00:09:30,935
FOR THE LIFE OF ME,
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHY.

232
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:32,670
(Chuckling)

233
00:09:32,737 --> 00:09:34,939
IT'S "MALE CALL"!

234
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:36,941
(Applause and cheering)

235
00:09:37,008 --> 00:09:38,943
(Whooping)

236
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,479
OK, HERE'S OUR FIRST LETTER,

237
00:09:41,546 --> 00:09:44,415
FROM ALLAN BERTHA IN ALBERTA.

238
00:09:44,482 --> 00:09:48,987
"DEAR RED GREEN,
WE ABSOLUTELY LOVE YOUR SHOW.

"WHAT A FINE, FINE PROGRAMME."

243
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:57,462
WAAA-HAW-HAW!

244
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:00,865
"THE SHOW IS CLEVER,
THOUGHTFUL, AND INFORMATIVE.

"YOU'RE REALLY A WONDER

246
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,502
"IN CANADIAN TELEVISION.

"LONG LIVE
'THE NEW RED AND GREEN SHOW.'"

248
00:10:07,872 --> 00:10:11,409
WELL, ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT
"THE NEW RED AND GREEN SHOW".

249
00:10:11,476 --> 00:10:13,478
IT'S JUST
"THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW".

250
00:10:13,545 --> 00:10:14,879
THERE'S NO "AND".

251
00:10:14,946 --> 00:10:18,149
I MAY CHANGE MY MIDDLE NAME
TO "AND".

252
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:19,617
OH, LOOK, OK.

253
00:10:19,684 --> 00:10:22,420
"MY SON'S FAVOURITE PART
IS WHEN YOU RACE YOUR BOAT."

254
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:24,055
RACE YOUR BOAT?

255
00:10:24,122 --> 00:10:25,490
I KNOW WHAT HE MEANS.

256
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:28,927
REMEMBER THE WATER SKIING,
"ADVENTURES WITH BILL"?

257
00:10:28,993 --> 00:10:31,696
OH, THAT'S, LIKE,
THREE SEASONS AGO.

258
00:10:31,763 --> 00:10:33,231
WELL, THAT'S-- ALL RIGHTY.

259
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:35,733
"WE ALSO LIKE
WHEN YOU AND YOUR BAND SING."

260
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,436
(Audience laughing)

261
00:10:38,503 --> 00:10:40,772
NO, THEY'RE TALKING
ABOUT THE CAMPFIRE SONGS.

262
00:10:40,838 --> 00:10:42,941
YEAH, THE
CAMPFIRE SONGS.

263
00:10:43,007 --> 00:10:44,275
I'M IN A BAND!

264
00:10:44,342 --> 00:10:45,810
ALL RIGHT, UM...

265
00:10:45,877 --> 00:10:49,647
"MY DAD'S FAVOURITE PART IS THE
SPORTS BLOOPERS" -- OK, WHAT?

266
00:10:49,714 --> 00:10:50,948
(Audience laughing)

267
00:10:51,015 --> 00:10:52,216
ALL RIGHT, I--

268
00:10:52,283 --> 00:10:53,518
UH, YES, YES.

269
00:10:53,584 --> 00:10:56,154
THERE IS A PART
WITH SPORTS BLOOPERS ON.

270
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,189
I CAN'T REMEMBER IT RIGHT NOW.

271
00:10:58,256 --> 00:10:59,957
THANKS, I APPRECIATE THAT.

272
00:11:00,024 --> 00:11:03,094
THE IMPORTANT THING IS
THAT THEY LIKE THE SHOW.

273
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:05,163
"AND WHEN YOU AND YOUR WIFE

WELL, UH, THANKS VERY MUCH,
YOU KNOW.

WE'RE GONNA BACK OFF ON
SINGING WITH THE DAUGHTERS.

284
00:11:29,754 --> 00:11:31,422
I SHOULD TELL YOU THAT.

285
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:33,925
UNTIL THEN, KEEP WATCHING
AND, UH...

286

(Applause)

288
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:42,900
GARTH HARBLE HERE,
ANIMAL CONTROL.

289
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:45,837
THIS WEEK
WE'RE FEATURING INSECTS.

290
00:11:45,903 --> 00:11:47,638
COME ON IN HERE, RED.

291
00:11:47,705 --> 00:11:50,842
SOMETHING HAPPEN TO
YOUR HANDS THERE, GARTH?

292
00:11:50,908 --> 00:11:52,343
OK, ALL RIGHT.

293
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,680
THAT'S A GOOD TIP
FOR YOU YOUNG PEOPLE.

294
00:11:55,746 --> 00:11:58,883
IF YOU'RE OUT IN THE WOODS
AND A BEEHIVE,

295
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,686
OR, FOR THAT MATTER,
A HORNETS' NEST

296
00:12:01,752 --> 00:12:05,857
SHOULD FALL OUT OF THE TREES,
DON'T TRY TO CATCH IT.

297
00:12:05,923 --> 00:12:08,326
HOW MANY STINGS
DID YOU TAKE, GARTH?

298
00:12:08,392 --> 00:12:11,829
GEE, I'D SAY 30, 40, 50,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

299
00:12:11,896 --> 00:12:14,932
HAD BLURRED VISION
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

300
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:17,969
BOSS WOULDN'T LET ME
TAKE ANY TIME OFF,

301
00:12:18,035 --> 00:12:20,871
JUST WOULDN'T LET ME
DRIVE THE TRUCK.

302
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:23,808
I LOVE THAT TRUCK.

303
00:12:23,874 --> 00:12:27,311
SO, IS THAT YOUR TIP
FOR THIS WEEK?

304
00:12:27,378 --> 00:12:28,813
HUH?

305
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,314
YOUR TIP?

306
00:12:30,381 --> 00:12:35,820
OH, NO -- TODAY
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SPIDERS.

307
00:12:35,886 --> 00:12:37,321
DON'T LIKE SPIDERS.

308
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:38,823
I KNOW, I KNOW.

309
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:40,324
ARACHNOPHOBIA.

310
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:41,826
IT'S A COMMON FEAR.

311
00:12:41,892 --> 00:12:44,128
BUT THERE'S NO REASON FOR IT,

312
00:12:44,195 --> 00:12:46,764
BECAUSE 99% OF
THE WORLD'S SPIDERS

313
00:12:46,831 --> 00:12:51,035
ARE A VALUABLE, HARMLESS PART
OF THE ECOLOGICAL CHAIN.

314
00:12:51,102 --> 00:12:53,104
IT'S JUST THAT MOST PEOPLE

315
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,840
DON'T WANT THEM AROUND
THEIR HOUSE.

316
00:12:55,906 --> 00:12:57,341
SO HERE'S A TIP.

317
00:12:57,408 --> 00:13:01,345
TAKE A PIECE OF BREAD --
COULD BE RYE, PUMPERNICKEL,

318
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:04,081
AND SOAK THAT
IN WATER AND SUGAR.

319
00:13:04,148 --> 00:13:07,351
PUT THAT IN A JAR
AND KEEP THE TOP OFF.

320
00:13:07,418 --> 00:13:10,654
OH, GEE, THAT DOESN'T WANT TO
COME OFF.

321
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:12,857
GIVE ME A HAND WITH IT.

322
00:13:12,923 --> 00:13:16,093
HOW MANY, UH,
HOW MANY YOU GOT IN THERE?

323
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,597
OH, GEE, I'D SAY, 1, 2,
I'D SAY 600 OR 700.

324
00:13:19,663 --> 00:13:21,098
DON'T LIKE SPIDERS.

325
00:13:21,165 --> 00:13:22,633
HELP ME WITH IT.

326
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,135
GO ON, GO ON, GO ON.

327
00:13:24,201 --> 00:13:25,636
OH, CATCH IT!

328
00:13:25,703 --> 00:13:27,138
OH, OH, NO!

329
00:13:27,204 --> 00:13:28,639
OH, THERE HE GOES.

330
00:13:28,706 --> 00:13:30,307
THEY LOOK ANGRY.

331
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:32,309
HE'S UP THAT WAY.

332
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:36,480
(Laughing)

333
00:13:36,547 --> 00:13:37,982
ANOTHER SUPER DAY.

334
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:39,483
OOPS, THERE HE GOES.

335
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,985
RIGHT UP THERE.

336
00:13:41,051 --> 00:13:42,720
(Laughing)

337
00:13:42,786 --> 00:13:44,488
WELL, LESS THAN 12 HOURS

338
00:13:44,555 --> 00:13:48,092
UNTIL THE BIG THING
COMES THROUGH ON THE HIGHWAY.

339
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,928
SPECULATION
IS GOING CRAZY AROUND HERE.

340
00:13:50,995 --> 00:13:53,931
NUCLEAR REACTOR, SPACE SHUTTLE,
PIPELINE.

341
00:13:53,998 --> 00:13:58,636
MAYBE IT'S JUST ALL THE COPIES
TO KEVIN COSTNER'S "WATERWORLD".

342
00:13:58,702 --> 00:14:00,337
UNCLE RED, UNCLE RED!

343
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:01,839
THE TOWN'S EMPTY.

344
00:14:01,906 --> 00:14:04,174
THE CEMETERY'S EMPTY --
EVERYBODY'S GONE.

345
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:07,478
IT'S LIKE THAT MOVIE
"BRAIN SUCKERS FROM MARS",

346
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:09,346
EXCEPT OUR TOWN'S DUMPIER.

347
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:12,249
THERE'S A RUMOUR
THAT THE BIG THING

348
00:14:12,316 --> 00:14:14,151
IS TOO BIG FOR THE HIGHWAY,

349
00:14:14,218 --> 00:14:17,154
SO THEY'RE BRINGING IT UP
ON THE RAIL LINE.

350
00:14:17,221 --> 00:14:18,656
LET'S GO THERE.

351
00:14:18,722 --> 00:14:20,157
NO -- EVERYBODY'S GONE.

352
00:14:20,224 --> 00:14:21,992
SO WE CAN GO TO THE HIGHWAY

353
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:24,795
AND GET A GOOD SPOT
FOR OUR TAILGATE PARTY.

354
00:14:24,862 --> 00:14:26,797
YOU STARTED THAT RUMOUR.

355
00:14:26,864 --> 00:14:28,799
THAT'S DIRTY!

356
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:31,802
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

357
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:33,304
GRAB THE BAG.

358
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:36,206
YOU TOLD A FIB TO GET
A BETTER PARKING SPOT.

359
00:14:36,273 --> 00:14:37,675
I DON'T LIKE LINE-UPS.

360
00:14:37,741 --> 00:14:40,210
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
POLICE LINE-UPS?

361
00:14:40,277 --> 00:14:42,313
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT MUG SHOTS?

362
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:45,315
WOULDN'T MIND TAKING
A SHOT AT YOURS.

363
00:14:45,382 --> 00:14:47,985
(Audience laughing)

364
00:14:48,052 --> 00:14:50,287
HI, THERE --
RANGER GORD AGAIN.

365
00:14:50,354 --> 00:14:54,224
IN THE 16 YEARS I'VE BEEN
MANNING FIRE WATCHTOWER 13

366
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:58,162
I'VE OBSERVED ALL MANNER OF
EXOTIC ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR.

367
00:14:58,228 --> 00:15:02,266
BUT THERE'S THREE THINGS
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND.

368
00:15:02,332 --> 00:15:03,867
FIRST, WHY DO FOXES

369
00:15:03,934 --> 00:15:06,670
CIRCLE TWICE
BEFORE THEY LIE DOWN?

370
00:15:06,737 --> 00:15:08,472
WHY DO DEER STOP AND STARE

371
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:10,841
IF YOU SHINE A LIGHT
IN THEIR EYES?

372
00:15:10,908 --> 00:15:13,343
THE THIRD THING IS,
WHY DO BEARS

373
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,846
ALWAYS SCRATCH THEMSELVES
AGAINST TREE--

374
00:15:15,913 --> 00:15:17,848
OH.

375
00:15:17,915 --> 00:15:20,350
OOH.

376
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:22,786
WELL, MAYBE THERE'S
ONLY TWO THINGS

377
00:15:22,853 --> 00:15:24,855
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

378
00:15:26,857 --> 00:15:29,526
(Red): MEANWHILE,
I'M BACK WITH BILL

379
00:15:29,593 --> 00:15:32,996
TRYING TO MAKE THIS SCAFFOLD,
RAISED-UP-THING.

380
00:15:33,063 --> 00:15:34,898
THIS IS A THREE-LEGGED LADDER.

381
00:15:34,965 --> 00:15:38,135
IT'S USED FOR PICKING THINGS
OUT OF TREES.

382
00:15:38,202 --> 00:15:41,438
BILL SHOULD HAVE PICKED
A BETTER LADDER.

383
00:15:41,505 --> 00:15:42,973
THEN HE GETS AN IDEA.

384
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,810
TIE THAT OFF LIKE A TETHER,
LIKE THEY DO WITH A HORSE,

385
00:15:46,877 --> 00:15:48,512
A THREE-LEGGED HORSE.

386
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:51,048
THEY TETHER THEM OFF
APPARENTLY.

387
00:15:51,114 --> 00:15:54,351
WE'LL USE A THIRD LADDER
AS SCAFFOLDING.

388
00:15:54,418 --> 00:15:56,553
KIND OF WORKING IN THREES.

389
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,822
IT'S A SCAFFOLD
MANEGE A TROIS.

390
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:02,359
THE LADDER WAS, UNFORTUNATELY,
A LITTLE LONG.

391
00:16:02,426 --> 00:16:05,629
RATHER THAN TAKE THE TIME
TO MOVE THE LADDERS,

392
00:16:05,696 --> 00:16:08,265
BILL DECIDED HE'D
HORSE HER IN THERE.

393
00:16:08,332 --> 00:16:11,635
WHAT HAPPENED WAS --
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

394
00:16:11,702 --> 00:16:12,936
OUT COME THE LEGS.

395
00:16:13,003 --> 00:16:14,471
OUT COME THE TETHERS.

396
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:15,973
DON'T WATCH THIS, KIDS.

397
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:18,442
THIS GETS VIOLENT.

398
00:16:18,508 --> 00:16:20,611
BOY, THAT'S GOTTA HURT.

399
00:16:20,677 --> 00:16:23,647
THIS PART HERE'S
NO FUN EITHER.

400
00:16:23,714 --> 00:16:27,184
SO WE REGROUP AND GET
THAT LADDER TIED UP THERE.

401
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,286
I'M GETTING OUT OF THERE.

402
00:16:29,353 --> 00:16:31,088
BILL DECIDES HE'S GONNA...

403
00:16:31,154 --> 00:16:33,290
BOY, OH, BOY.

404
00:16:33,357 --> 00:16:34,791
AMAZING, ISN'T IT?

405
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:37,794
DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME,
IF YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE

406
00:16:37,861 --> 00:16:39,529
SOME THREE-LEGGED LADDERS.

407
00:16:39,596 --> 00:16:41,198
HE GETS HIMSELF UP THERE.

408
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:43,667
HE SAYS HE'S GOT
A GOOD PERSPECTIVE

409
00:16:43,734 --> 00:16:45,802
TO WATCH THE BIG THING GO BY.

410
00:16:45,869 --> 00:16:47,304
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

411
00:16:47,371 --> 00:16:48,805
HUH?

412
00:16:48,872 --> 00:16:50,307
OH, MY GOSH.

413
00:16:50,374 --> 00:16:53,310
HE'S GONNA SIT
IN A LAWN CHAIR.

414
00:16:53,377 --> 00:16:55,312
HE'S GOT HIS THERMOS.

415
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:57,514
WHAT'S IN THERE, BILL?

416
00:16:57,581 --> 00:16:59,549
INTELLIGENCE?

417
00:16:59,616 --> 00:17:01,918
LOOK AT HIM SITTING THERE.

418
00:17:01,985 --> 00:17:05,188
MIND YOU, HE'D ADDED
A LOT OF WEIGHT.

419
00:17:05,255 --> 00:17:09,793
BILL, DO YOU NOTICE SOMETHING
GOING TERRIBLY WRONG?

420
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,130
OH BOY, OH BOY,
OH BOY, OH BOY, OH, OH.

421
00:17:13,196 --> 00:17:14,631
I TOLD HIM

422
00:17:14,698 --> 00:17:16,867
THIS WOULDN'T WORK.

423
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:18,368
WAIT NOW.

424
00:17:18,435 --> 00:17:20,337
WAIT A SECOND.

425
00:17:20,403 --> 00:17:22,405
YEAH, THIS DOES GIVE ME

426
00:17:22,472 --> 00:17:25,075
A BETTER VIEW OF THE PARADE.

427
00:17:25,142 --> 00:17:26,743
FIND OUT HOW HAP GOT INTO

428
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,845
"THE GUINESS BOOK OF RECORDS".

429
00:17:34,818 --> 00:17:37,153
MY UNCLE RED
CAN'T BE HERE RIGHT NOW.

430
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,156
HE'S AT THE HIGHWAY
WAITING FOR THE BIG THING.

431
00:17:40,223 --> 00:17:41,892
THAT'S WHERE EVERYBODY IS.

432
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,094
THEY'VE GOT EVERYTHING
DOWN THERE.

433
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,097
THERE'S HOT-DOG STANDS
AND CHIP WAGONS.

434
00:17:47,163 --> 00:17:49,566
PONY RIDES,
THEY GOT PONY RIDES.

435
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:52,702
THEY GOT PHONE BOOTHS
AND PORTABLE TOILETS.

436
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:54,204
IT'S LIKE WOODSTOCK,

437
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:56,940
BUT INSTEAD OF HAVING
THE BEST MUSIC,

438
00:17:57,007 --> 00:17:59,509
THEY'VE GOT...
A REALLY BIG THING.

439
00:17:59,576 --> 00:18:01,077
I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE

440
00:18:01,144 --> 00:18:03,680
WHO HAD AN IDEA ABOUT
SELLING STUFF.

441
00:18:03,747 --> 00:18:05,982
DALTON HUMPHREY HAS GOT THESE.

442
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:08,952
"I SAW THE BIG THING."

443
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:10,920
AND THERE'S, UH...

444
00:18:10,987 --> 00:18:13,556
"BIG THING ON BOARD".

445
00:18:13,623 --> 00:18:16,926
IT'S FOR UNCLE RED.

446
00:18:16,993 --> 00:18:19,562
"MY FOLKS WENT TO SEE
THE BIG THING

447
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:21,998
"AND ALL I GOT WAS
THIS LITTLE THING."

448
00:18:22,065 --> 00:18:23,900
HAROLD, WHERE WERE YA?!

449
00:18:23,967 --> 00:18:27,404
YOU MISSED THE BIG CONTRAPTION
COMING DOWN THE ROAD,

450
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,739
TAKING OUT POLES,
TAKING OUT TREES,

451
00:18:29,806 --> 00:18:31,241
TAKING OUT LINES.

452
00:18:31,307 --> 00:18:32,876
THE BIG
THING CAME?!

453
00:18:32,942 --> 00:18:35,145
NO, NO, NO,
MOOSE THOMPSON.

454
00:18:35,211 --> 00:18:39,115
HE NAILED FIVE PICNIC TABLES
TO HIS TRUCK FOR HIS PARTY.

455
00:18:39,182 --> 00:18:40,884
HE'S BARRELLING INTO TOWN.

456
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,585
BY THE TIME HE GOT THERE

457
00:18:42,652 --> 00:18:45,922
IT WAS COVERED WITH
LAUNDRY AND PIECES OF BIRDS.

458
00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:47,924
YEAH,
OH, YEAH.

459
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:49,426
WE GOTTA GO.

460
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:51,828
BERNICE IS HOLDING OUR SPACE.

461
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:53,596
YOU FOLKS WATCH THIS.

462
00:18:53,663 --> 00:18:55,165
COME ON, HAROLD.

463
00:18:55,231 --> 00:18:57,500
HERE WE ARE
WITH HAP SHAUGHNESSY.

464
00:18:57,567 --> 00:18:59,269
WHAT ARE WE FISHING FOR?

465
00:18:59,335 --> 00:19:00,770
SPECKLED TROUT.

466
00:19:00,837 --> 00:19:02,272
THE CONDITIONS ARE GOOD.

467
00:19:02,338 --> 00:19:04,274
I THINK I'M GONNA
HOOK A BIG ONE.

468
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,777
MIGHT GET INTO "THE GUINESS
BOOK OF WORLD RECORDS".

469
00:19:07,844 --> 00:19:09,279
NO, NOT AGAIN.

470
00:19:09,345 --> 00:19:11,214
LET SOMEONE ELSE
HAVE A TURN.

471
00:19:11,281 --> 00:19:13,383
YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT YOU'RE IN

472
00:19:13,449 --> 00:19:15,785
"THE GUINESS BOOK
OF WORLD RECORDS"?

473
00:19:15,852 --> 00:19:17,287
YEAH, A FEW TIMES.

474
00:19:17,353 --> 00:19:19,789
HAVE A CATEGORY FOR B.S.,
DO THEY?

475
00:19:19,856 --> 00:19:21,291
PROBABLY.

476
00:19:21,357 --> 00:19:24,427
I'M IN IT FOR
THE WORLD'S LONGEST KISS,

477
00:19:24,494 --> 00:19:26,563
THE WORLD'S STRONGEST MAN,

478
00:19:26,629 --> 00:19:29,465
AND THE WORLD'S FATTEST MAN:
972 POUNDS.

479
00:19:29,532 --> 00:19:31,434
AND I SET THE RECORD FOR

480
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:35,638
THE MOST WEIGHT EVER LOST
BY ONE PERSON: 801 POUNDS,

481
00:19:35,705 --> 00:19:37,974
AND THE LONGEST BUNGEE JUMP.

482
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:43,012
THOSE LAST TWO RECORDS
WERE SET THE SAME DAY.

483
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:46,082
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS
WHAT I FOUND, HAP.

484
00:19:46,149 --> 00:19:48,518
"THE GUINESS BOOK
OF WORLD RECORDS".

485
00:19:48,585 --> 00:19:50,820
WHAT PAGE DID YOU SAY
YOU WERE ON?

486
00:19:50,887 --> 00:19:53,356
ALL MY RECORDS
HAVE BEEN BROKEN BY NOW.

487
00:19:53,423 --> 00:19:55,625
ESPECIALLY
THE WORLD'S FATTEST MAN.

488
00:19:55,692 --> 00:19:58,328
I GUESS THIS NEW GUY
JUST WANTED IT MORE.

489
00:19:58,394 --> 00:19:59,862
WITHOUT ANY PROOF, HAP,

490
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:03,333
IT MAKES A LOT OF THE THINGS
YOU SAY HARD TO BELIEVE.

491
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:06,202
I DON'T CARE WHETHER
YOU BELIEVE ME OR NOT.

492
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:08,271
I'M NOT OUT TO SET
ANY RECORDS.

493
00:20:08,338 --> 00:20:09,772
I DON'T KNOW, HAP.

494
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,741
SOME OF THE STORIES YOU TELL,

495
00:20:11,808 --> 00:20:14,277
YOU'VE GOT TO BE GETTING
PRETTY CLOSE.

496
00:20:14,344 --> 00:20:16,846
YEAH, I GUESS HE'S RIGHT.

497
00:20:19,282 --> 00:20:21,484
HEY, HANDYMAN,
HERE'S A TIP FOR YA.

498
00:20:21,551 --> 00:20:24,087
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO PULL-START
A LAWN MOWER

499
00:20:24,153 --> 00:20:26,789
AND IT DOESN'T GO
ON THE FIRST 117 TRIES,

500
00:20:26,856 --> 00:20:28,291
GIVE IT UP.

501
00:20:28,358 --> 00:20:29,792
OTHERWISE YOU'RE GONNA

502
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:32,428
PULL LIGAMENTS
THROUGH THIS AREA,

503
00:20:32,495 --> 00:20:34,464
RIGHT UP INTO THE SHOULDER.

504
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,666
AND DON'T EVER KICK A MACHINE

505
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:38,735
WITH SOFT-SOLED SHOES ON.

506
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:42,805
(Engine starts)

507
00:20:42,872 --> 00:20:44,307
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!

508
00:20:44,373 --> 00:20:45,808
HEY, HEY, YOU!

509
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,376
COME BACK HERE.

510
00:20:53,382 --> 00:20:55,218
THE BIG THING WAS
A BIG BUST.

511
00:20:55,284 --> 00:20:56,719
DIDN'T EVEN SHOW UP.

512
00:20:56,786 --> 00:20:59,322
I THINK THAT ROAD CREW
WAS HAVING US ON.

513
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:01,657
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

514
00:21:01,724 --> 00:21:03,559
THE BIG THING CAME BY AT 9:25.

515
00:21:03,626 --> 00:21:05,361
I DIDN'T SEE IT, HAROLD.

516
00:21:05,428 --> 00:21:07,763
NONE OF THE LODGE MEMBERS
SAW IT.

517
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,265
OF COURSE NOT!

518
00:21:09,332 --> 00:21:11,901
YOU WERE IN THE MINI-PUTT THING
ALL DAY.

519
00:21:11,968 --> 00:21:14,504
THE REST OF THE GUYS WERE
LINE DANCING,

520
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:17,440
RIDING THE FERRIS WHEEL,
IN THE BEER GARDEN.

521
00:21:17,507 --> 00:21:20,076
WAS IT BIG?

522
00:21:20,142 --> 00:21:22,712
HUGE.

523
00:21:22,778 --> 00:21:24,914
WHAT WAS IT, HAROLD?

524
00:21:24,981 --> 00:21:27,583
YOU CAN FIND OUT
FOR MERELY $10, V.H.S.

525
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,085
OR $12, BETA.

526
00:21:29,151 --> 00:21:30,586
(Audience laughing)

527
00:21:30,653 --> 00:21:34,724
I HAD TO CLIMB OVER BRAMBLES
AND ROCK IN MERCURY CREEK

528
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,225
TO GET THESE SHOTS.

529
00:21:36,292 --> 00:21:38,427
I HUNG BY A TREE BY MY FEET.

530
00:21:38,494 --> 00:21:40,663
BUT I AM GOING TO BE RICH,

531
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,899
BECAUSE I AM THE ONLY ONE
WITH FOOTAGE OF...

532
00:21:43,966 --> 00:21:45,401
THE BIG THING.

533
00:21:45,468 --> 00:21:47,937
EVERYBODY'S GONNA
WANT ONE COPY.

534
00:21:48,004 --> 00:21:50,106
OH NO, THEY'RE NOT, HAROLD.

535
00:21:50,172 --> 00:21:53,542
EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT
THE BIG THING FOR DAYS.

536
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:56,779
NOT THE BIG THING --
GOING TO THE BIG THING.

537
00:21:56,846 --> 00:21:58,981
GOING ON RIDES,
PLAYING BINGO,

538
00:21:59,048 --> 00:22:01,851
EATING BARBECUE,
HAVING THE BEER TENT.

539
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:03,052
THAT WAS THE FUN.

540
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,255
COURSE, YOU MISSED THAT,
BUT THAT'S NORMAL.

541
00:22:06,322 --> 00:22:07,990
BUT I'M THE ONE WHO SAW

542
00:22:08,057 --> 00:22:11,027
THE THING THAT WAS CARRYING
THE BIG THING,

543
00:22:11,093 --> 00:22:13,496
I KNOW HOW MANY TIRES IT HAD --
59.

544
00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:14,897
GREAT, I WIN.

545
00:22:14,997 --> 00:22:16,866
NO WAY --
YOU SAID 1,000!

546
00:22:16,932 --> 00:22:19,602
DIDN'T HAVE TO GET RIGHT ON--
I'M THE CLOSEST.

547
00:22:21,337 --> 00:22:22,405
(Possum squeal)

548
00:22:22,571 --> 00:22:23,639
MEETING TIME.

549
00:22:23,706 --> 00:22:24,774
AWAY YOU GO, HAROLD.

550
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,108
OH, CHEER UP.

551
00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:30,446
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,
I'LL BE HOME AFTER THE MEETING.

552
00:22:31,247 --> 00:22:32,615
I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU
MY PRIZE

553
00:22:32,715 --> 00:22:34,583
BECAUSE YOU ARE THE BIG THING
IN MY LIFE.

554
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:36,118
I HOPE THAT MAKES UP FOR

555
00:22:36,218 --> 00:22:37,586
WHAT I YELLED
ON THE ROLLER COASTER.

556
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,088
I WAS USING AN EXPRESSION.

557
00:22:39,321 --> 00:22:40,689
I WASN'T REFERRING TO
YOUR MOTHER.

558
00:22:42,591 --> 00:22:43,959
THANKS FOR WATCHING,

559
00:22:44,126 --> 00:22:46,562
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND HAROLD
AND THE GANG AT POSSUM LODGE,

560
00:22:47,062 --> 00:22:48,731
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

561
00:22:49,064 --> 00:22:50,733
(Applause)

562
00:22:54,136 --> 00:22:56,038
(Possum squeal)

563
00:22:56,172 --> 00:23:00,109
(Snoring)

564
00:23:05,915 --> 00:23:07,650
(Harold): ALL RISE.

565
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:13,722
(Red and Harold): QUANDO OMNI
FLUNKUS, MORITATI.
