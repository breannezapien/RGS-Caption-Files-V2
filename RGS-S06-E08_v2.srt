1
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:04,304
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

2
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:07,874
HERE'S THE MAN WITH THE SPRING
IN HIS STEP

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:10,710
SINCE HIS POCKETWATCH EXPLODED
IN HIS PANTS,

4
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:12,779
YOUR HERO, MY UNCLE, RED GREEN!

5
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,148
WHOOOO!

6
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:16,649
THANKS, APPRECIATE IT.

7
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:19,119
(Howling)

8
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,687
OOH, RED, OOOH!

9
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,055
ALL RIGHT.

10
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,523
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

11
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,325
GONNA GET THE SHOW GOING

12
00:00:25,391 --> 00:00:27,360
'CAUSE I'M ALREADY LATE FOR

13
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:29,095
THE MONTHLY POKER GAME.

14
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,930
A BUNCH OF OVERWEIGHT GUYS,

15
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:32,999
DRINKIN' BEER, SMOKIN' CIGARS.

16
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,267
HOW IS
THAT FUN?

17
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,436
WELL, YOU WON'T BE THERE.

18
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:40,140
YOU'RE ALL A BUNCH OF SHIRKERS.

19
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,875
YOU'RE SHIRKING
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY

20
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,209
BY PLAYING POKER.

21
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:44,878
SHIRKER, SHIRKER,
SHIRKER, SHIRKER!

22
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,779
SHA-A-A-A-AMELESS SHIRKER!

23
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:51,050
SHIRKING YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES,
GO PLAY AT CARDS,

24
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:55,388
INDULGE IN STUPID STORIES FULL
OF EXAGGERATION AND INNUENDO.

25
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,857
YOU'RE AN AWFUL GOOD GUESSER.

26
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:01,294
IF THAT'S WHAT BEING AN ADULT
IS ABOUT,

27
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,329
I HOPE
I NEVER GROW UP.

28
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,565
THAT COULD BE ARRANGED.

29
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:10,637
(Horns honking)

30
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:12,605
(Geese honking)

31
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,610
(Quacking)

32
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,481
(Red): YOU'RE LOOKIN'
AT SEGMENTS

33
00:01:21,547 --> 00:01:23,916
FROM THIS PARTICULAR SHOW,
THE MAIN MESSAGE BEING,

34
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,052
FOR GOSH SAKES,
DON'T EVEN THINK

35
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,920
ABOUT CHANGING THE CHANNEL.

36
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:31,157
TO MAKE SENSE
OUT OF THIS PROGRAMME,

37
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:34,127
YOU GOTTA GIVE IT
YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.

38
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:45,872
(Laughing)

39
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:47,407
(Laughing)

40
00:01:47,473 --> 00:01:50,710
THE POKER GAME BREAK UP EARLY?

41
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,578
YOU STILL HAVE
YOUR SHIRT.

42
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,647
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT, HAROLD.

43
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,482
I WAS WINNING ALL NIGHT.

44
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,552
THE LAST HAND, I PUT
THE WHOLE WORKS ON THE LINE.

45
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,587
I'M SENSING IT DIDN'T GO WELL.

46
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:04,123
IT WAS MY FAVOURITE GAME:
"ODD MAN OUT".

47
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,793
THREES, FIVES, SEVENS,
AND NINES ARE WILD,

48
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:09,662
PLUS ONE-EYED JACKS
AND THE MAN WITH THE AXE.

49
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,298
SO I'M SITTING THERE
WITH 11 QUEENS.

50
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:14,200
I'M NOT GONNA LET ON.

51
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,436
JUST KINDA PLAY IT COOL.

52
00:02:16,502 --> 00:02:20,006
SO STINKY BETS, I RAISE,
BUSTER RAISES, MOOSE FOLDS.

53
00:02:20,072 --> 00:02:22,341
SO DOES THE CHAIR
HE'S SITTIN' ON.

54
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:26,078
THEN STINKY RAISES AGAIN,
I RAISE AGAIN, BUSTER CALLS.

55
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:28,614
I LAY DOWN MY 11 QUEENS.

56
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:31,751
BUSTER HAD A FULL HOUSE --
FIVE EIGHTS AND SIX NINES.

57
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,587
AND, UH...

58
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,389
I'M REACHING FOR THE POT...

59
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:38,090
STINKY LAYS DOWN 12 ACES!

60
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:39,525
CLEANED ME RIGHT OUT!

61
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:42,028
YOU KNOW, UNCLE RED,
IF YOU PLAYED

62
00:02:42,094 --> 00:02:43,596
WITH FEWER WILD CARDS,

63
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:47,066
YOU'D HAVE LESS CHANCE
OF SOMEONE GETTING 12 ACES.

64
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,968
THERE WERE 12
NATURAL ACES.

65
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:50,469
(Audience laughing)

66
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:52,138
UNCLE RED, THERE'S ONLY

67
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:55,274
FOUR NATURAL ACES IN A DECK,
AREN'T THERE?

68
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,742
WELL, AROUND THAT.

69
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:59,078
I LIKE TO TAKE AN EXTRA ONE,

70
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,713
JUST IN CASE, YOU KNOW.

71
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,915
SOME OF THE OTHER GUYS,
MAYBE...

72
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:06,519
BUT THERE'S NEVER MORE
THAN FIVE OR SIX EXTRA ACES.

73
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:10,389
IF STINKY HAD 12 AND THERE'S
ONLY 4, THEN HE BROUGHT 8.

74
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,658
SOMEBODY'S CHEATING!

75
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,962
(Red): LATER ON

76
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:18,898
WE'LL BE DOING
A LITTLE FRUIT-PICKING

77
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:22,268
WITH TWO GUYS
WHO ARE PERFECT FOR THE JOB,

78
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,769
BILL AND HAROLD.

79
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:27,106
THAT'S A PRETTY CLASSY-LOOKING
LADDER THERE, BUT...

80
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:30,309
THE OPERATOR IS AT ABOUT
THE SAME LEVEL AS USUAL.

81
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,511
THIS IS ONE OF
THE OLD TRADTIONS--

82
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:34,280
THERE'S NO BOTTOM IN THAT.

83
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,983
ONE OF THE TRADTIONS
AROUND THE LODGE IS TO

84
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,252
FORGET ABOUT
THE MECHANIZED-- OH.

85
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,155
FORGET ABOUT
THE MECHANIZED-- HA, HA, HA.

86
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:45,524
THE MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT
AND SO ON.

87
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:46,659
'CAUSE IT'S JUST

88
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,128
MORE FUN
PICKING FRUIT BY HAND.

89
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:52,198
IT WILL TAKE A LONG TIME
TO FILL THAT BASKET.

90
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:54,133
IT'S REVENGE OF THE NERDS.

91
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,335
THERE WE GO.

92
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,404
(Laughing)

93
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,905
BY GOLLY, EH.

94
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:02,908
AND THEY SAY
FRUIT'S NOT GOOD FOR YA.

95
00:04:02,975 --> 00:04:05,544
OH MY GOSH,
IT'S WATERMELON MAN.

96
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:09,749
OH, THE MOON IS
A STRANGE SHADE OF YELLOW

97
00:04:09,815 --> 00:04:13,752
WITH STRIPES
OF MAGENTA AND BLUE

98
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:16,255
THE CLOUDS ARE PURPLE
AND ORANGE

99
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:19,425
AND THE MIST SMELLS
LIKE AN OLD SHOE

100
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:22,928
OH, I HAVE
A HORRIBLE HEADACHE

101
00:04:22,995 --> 00:04:25,931
AND I PASS OUT
EVERY MINUTE OR TWO

102
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:28,601
IT'S OK TO HAVE
A BONFIRE

103
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:32,004
BUT NOT IN
A FIBREGLASS CANOE

104
00:04:35,941 --> 00:04:38,744
THIS IS FOR THE BIG ONE --
A BENCH-STOP SIGN

105
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,380
AND A COUPON FOR
A FREE DRIVING LESSON!

106
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,850
UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO GET DOUGIE FRANKLIN

107
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,552
TO SAY THIS WORD...

108
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,220
(Quietly): "PET".

109
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:49,555
"PET".

110
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,723
OHHHH...

111
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:52,258
AND GO.
ALL RIGHT --
DOUGIE?

112
00:04:52,324 --> 00:04:53,592
YEAH!

113
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:55,995
A DOG.
FRIEND.

114
00:04:56,061 --> 00:04:58,631
NO, IT'S MORE THAN A FRIEND.

115
00:04:58,697 --> 00:05:00,933
FAMILY MEMBER.

116
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,035
THAT MAY VERY WELL BE.

117
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:05,537
OK, HOW ABOUT THIS -- CAT.

118
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:07,506
BULLDOZER!

119
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,008
(Audience laughing)

120
00:05:09,074 --> 00:05:11,410
NO, NO, NO,
LET'S GO ANOTHER WAY.

121
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:15,281
WHEN WE WERE YOUNG, WE WOULDN'T
MAKE OUT
 WITH GIRLS.

122
00:05:15,347 --> 00:05:17,416
WE WOULDN'T NECK WITH GIRLS.

123
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,751
WE WOULD...

124
00:05:18,817 --> 00:05:20,853
... CRY.

125
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:22,454
NO, NO, NO, NO.

126
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:24,223
THE WORD WE USED

127
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:25,924
INSTEAD OF
"MAKE OUT" WAS...

128
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:27,526
... LIE.

129
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,194
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

130
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:31,864
YOU GET SENIOR CITIZENS,
YOU KNOW?

131
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,366
AND THEY GET LONELY --
MANY DOCTORS WILL RECOMMEND

132
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:35,734
THEY GET A...

133
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:37,136
... LOBOTOMY.

134
00:05:37,202 --> 00:05:41,974
WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME,
I'M HAPPY TO REPORT.

135
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,109
ALL RIGHT,
BUDGIES AND PARAKEETS.

136
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:46,111
THESE ARE COMMON HOUSEHOLD...

137
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:48,180
... PE-- PESTS.

138
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:49,515
OHHH!

139
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:53,152
OK, YOU TAKE A PEST,
YOU TAKE THE "SSS" OUT.

140
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:55,487
AND WHAT YOU
HAVE IS A...

141
00:05:55,554 --> 00:05:58,056
YOU GOT A BLADDER PROBLEM.

142
00:05:58,123 --> 00:05:59,391
(Audience laughing)

143
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,860
YOU KNOW, WITH MONSTER-TRUCK
DRIVERS,

144
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:03,896
THAT'S ONE OF OUR PET PEEVES.

145
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:05,397
OHHH!

146
00:06:05,464 --> 00:06:06,899
WHAT? WHAT?

147
00:06:06,965 --> 00:06:09,134
CONGRATULATIONS, MR. FRANKLIN!

148
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:14,239
LAST WEEK, FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY,
I GAVE MY WIFE, BERNICE,

149
00:06:14,306 --> 00:06:17,643
THE ENTIRE JAMES BOND FILM
LIBRARY ON VIDEOCASSETTE.

150
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:19,411
SHOULD HAVE SEEN HER FACE.

151
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:20,779
SHAKEN, NOT STIRRED.

152
00:06:20,846 --> 00:06:24,216
LATER ON THAT EVENING,
BERNICE WAS SLEEPING UPSTAIRS,

153
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:25,784
SNORING LIKE A BANSHEE,

154
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:29,488
AND I WAS ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH
MY THIRD... UH, BIG FILM

155
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,757
AND I NOTICED AGENT 007
STRAPPED ON

156
00:06:31,823 --> 00:06:33,659
ONE OF THEM ROCKET JET-PACKS

157
00:06:33,725 --> 00:06:36,428
AND JUST TOOK OFF -- WHOOSH! --
LIKE THAT.

158
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:39,932
JUST LIKE THE TIME MOOSE
THOMPSON FELL OFF THE ROOF...

159
00:06:39,998 --> 00:06:41,700
EXCEPT BACKWARDS, YOU KNOW?

160
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:43,368
WHEN I SAW THAT JET-PACK,

161
00:06:43,435 --> 00:06:46,505
I KNEW WHAT I HAD TO BUILD
FOR "HANDYMAN CORNER".

162
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:50,475
FORGET ABOUT TRAFFIC JAMS,
PARKING SPACES, AND STOP SIGNS.

163
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:52,544
GET YOURSELF A ROCKET JET-PACK.

164
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:54,046
HERE'S ALL YOU NEED.

165
00:06:54,112 --> 00:06:57,416
GET A FUEL TANK --
GET SOME ROCKET FUEL IN THERE.

166
00:06:57,482 --> 00:06:59,151
GET A FUEL CONTROL VALVE.

167
00:06:59,217 --> 00:07:03,288
YOU'LL NEED A FUEL IGNITER AND
SOME KIND OF A ROCKET NOZZLE,

168
00:07:03,355 --> 00:07:06,692
SOME SORT OF METAL FRAME
TO HOLD 'ER ALL TOGETHER,

169
00:07:06,758 --> 00:07:08,894
AND, OF COURSE, A CRASH HELMET.

170
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:12,497
YOU CAN GET THIS FROM FORMER
SOVIET UNION ROCKET SCIENTISTS.

171
00:07:12,564 --> 00:07:15,534
THEY'LL SMUGGLE IT OUT
FOR A FEW THOUSAND DOLLARS.

172
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,803
OR YOU COULD JUST LOOK
IN YOUR GARAGE.

173
00:07:17,869 --> 00:07:20,405
PERSONALLY, I'M LEANIN'
TOWARDS THE GARAGE.

174
00:07:20,472 --> 00:07:23,775
ACTUALLY, THE GARAGE
IS LEANIN' TOWARDS
 ME.

175
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:31,483
(Grunting)

176
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:36,922
AHHH...

177
00:07:36,988 --> 00:07:41,226
THERE WE GO, OR, AS THE FRENCH
WOULD SAY, "VIOLA".

178
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:45,731
ALL RIGHT, FIRST THING
YOU LOOK AT IS YOUR FUEL TANK.

179
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:49,367
I'M GONNA GO WITH
THE DOUBLE TANK ON THIS.

180
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:53,872
I TELL YA, ME FLYING UP THERE
17,000 FEET,

181
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:57,809
HAVING TO STOP FOR FUEL,
THAT WOULD BE... INCONVENIENT.

182
00:07:57,876 --> 00:07:59,578
YOU DON'T SEE JAMES BOND

183
00:07:59,644 --> 00:08:02,080
RUNNIN' OUT OF GAS
EVERY HALF HOUR,

184
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:05,383
WHICH IS PROBABLY HOW
HE GETS ALL THOSE WOMEN.

185
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,053
FOR YOUR HOSES
AND YOUR ROCKET NOZZLE,

186
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:11,389
JUST USE EVERYTHING
THAT COMES IN THE BARBECUE.

187
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:12,824
YOUR 3-2-1 IGNITION...

188
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:15,460
YOU GOT THE BARBECUE STARTER
RIGHT THERE.

189
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:19,397
FOR YOUR VERTICAL THRUST, YOU
GOT YOUR BURNER CONTROL KNOBS.

190
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:22,534
I GUESS... COME OFF
WITH A WRENCH OF SOME KIND.

191
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:24,870
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A METAL FRAMEWORK

192
00:08:24,936 --> 00:08:27,138
TO HOLD THE WHOLE THING
TOGETHER.

193
00:08:31,243 --> 00:08:33,411
I WOULD USE THIS PART
OF THE UNIT.

194
00:08:33,478 --> 00:08:35,981
WHAT YOU WANNA DO IS
FORM THAT TOGETHER

195
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:37,849
AND STRAP 'ER ON YOUR BACK.

196
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,919
YOU COULD USE SEATBELTS
FOR THAT OR HEAVY ROPE

197
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:43,321
OR IF YOU WANTED
TO BE
 REAL
 SAFE...

198
00:08:43,388 --> 00:08:46,858
I RECOMMEND THE HANDYMAN'S
SECRET WEAPON, DUCT TAPE.

199
00:08:46,925 --> 00:08:48,693
JUST RELAX -- TAKE IT EASY.

200
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,429
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
A ROCKET SCIENTIST.

201
00:08:55,433 --> 00:08:56,701
JUST LIKE THAT.

202
00:08:56,768 --> 00:09:00,505
YOU'RE READY TO TAKE
YOUR EQUIPMENT AND PUT IT ON.

203
00:09:00,572 --> 00:09:03,975
YOU GOT YOUR FUEL LINES
ATTACHED TO YOUR FUEL TANKS.

204
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:07,545
THEY GO UP, ATTACHED IN
THROUGH YOUR FUEL REGULATORS,

205
00:09:07,612 --> 00:09:09,881
AND THEN ON
TO YOUR ROCKET NOZZLES.

206
00:09:09,948 --> 00:09:13,385
WHAT YOU WANNA DO THERE
IS JUST HOOK THEM ON...

207
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:15,687
HOOK THEM ON THE BACK
OF THE...

208
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:19,891
I FEEL LIKE THAT GUY THAT MAKES
ALL JAMES BOND'S EQUIPMENT.

209
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,393
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

210
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:24,562
"Q" -- YEAH,
AND HIS LETTER'S "Q", TOO.

211
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:25,897
I FEEL LIKE "Q".

212
00:09:25,964 --> 00:09:27,399
I LOOK LIKE "L".

213
00:09:27,465 --> 00:09:29,100
A LITTLE SPY HUMOUR.

214
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:31,703
HERE WE GO.

215
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,405
THERE I HAVE MY VERY OWN

216
00:09:33,471 --> 00:09:35,673
PERSONALIZED
JAMES BOND JET-PACK.

217
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,042
NOW ALL I NEED IS
A FLYING HELMET,

218
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:40,912
OR A CRASH HELMET,
AS PESSIMISTS CALL IT.

219
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:43,915
FOR THAT, I'M GONNA USE
THIS UNIT RIGHT HERE.

220
00:09:43,982 --> 00:09:45,283
EH? LOOK AT THAT.

221
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,720
DOESN'T THAT JUST SCREAM
"SAFETY" AND "SECRET AGENT"

222
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:50,488
AND "SPYING" AND "DANGER"?

223
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:52,090
JUST POP THAT BABY ON.

224
00:09:53,992 --> 00:09:55,960
EH? PERFECT, ISN'T IT?

225
00:09:56,027 --> 00:09:59,430
I'M THE SPY WHO CAME IN
FROM THE COALS.

226
00:09:59,497 --> 00:10:02,033
NOW WE JUST TURN ON
OUR ROCKET POWER.

227
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,935
LOST ONE OF MY KNOBS, THERE.

228
00:10:04,002 --> 00:10:05,270
HERE WE GO.

229
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:08,439
WHEN I WANT TO TAKE OFF,
I HIT THE IGNITION BUTTON.

230
00:10:08,506 --> 00:10:10,975
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

231
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:12,944
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

232
00:10:13,011 --> 00:10:15,079
I GOTTA FLY!

233
00:10:15,146 --> 00:10:17,882
(Explosion)

234
00:10:24,022 --> 00:10:25,957
(Grunting)

235
00:10:26,024 --> 00:10:27,292
AHHH...

236
00:10:27,358 --> 00:10:29,961
I SEE WHY THEY HAVE TO
KEEP GETTIN' NEW ACTORS

237
00:10:30,028 --> 00:10:31,462
TO PLAY JAMES BOND.

238
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:32,830
(Coughing)

239
00:10:32,897 --> 00:10:36,534
STAY TUNED -- WHATEVER THIS IS,
WE GOT MORE.

240
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:44,275
WANT TO TALK TO YOU GUYS ABOUT

241
00:10:44,342 --> 00:10:47,245
WHAT YOU SHOULD TELL YOUR KIDS
ABOUT LIFE.

242
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:51,182
IN MY DAY, FATHERS DIDN'T TALK
THAT MUCH TO THEIR KIDS.

243
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:55,553
THE ONLY ADVICE MY DAD GAVE ME
WAS, "DON'T SLOUCH LIKE THAT!"

244
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,056
IT WASN'T MUCH,
BUT IT MEANT A LOT.

245
00:10:58,122 --> 00:10:59,390
(Audience laughing)

246
00:10:59,457 --> 00:11:00,792
YOU KNOW, I THINK NOW

247
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:03,761
I KINDA WISH MY DAD
HAD GIVEN ME MORE ADVICE.

248
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:07,198
NOT THAT THE SLOUCHING THING
WASN'T REALLY TERRIFIC,

249
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:10,268
BUT MAYBE HE COULD HAVE
TAUGHT ME ABOUT CAREER

250
00:11:10,334 --> 00:11:13,371
OR MONEY OR MARRIAGE
OR WOMEN OR RELATIONSHIPS,

251
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:15,139
SOMETHING ALONG THAT LINE.

252
00:11:15,206 --> 00:11:18,910
'COURSE, NOW IT'S TOO LATE
'CAUSE DAD HAS LEFT US.

253
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:21,145
HE'S GONE TO LIVE IN FLORIDA.

254
00:11:21,212 --> 00:11:22,647
(Laughing)

255
00:11:22,714 --> 00:11:24,449
I WAS SITTIN' HERE, THINKING,

256
00:11:24,515 --> 00:11:27,585
"WHAT COULD I TELL PEOPLE
TO TELL THEIR YOUNGSTERS?"

257
00:11:27,652 --> 00:11:29,720
SOMETHING THAT WOULD
HELP THEM OUT.

258
00:11:29,787 --> 00:11:32,790
I THINK OF THE ONE THING,
THE ONE PIECE OF ADVICE,

259
00:11:32,857 --> 00:11:36,260
THAT WOULD HAVE SAVED ME A LOT
OF GRIEF AND TIME AND MONEY.

260
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:37,595
I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

261
00:11:37,662 --> 00:11:39,597
TAKE CARE OF YOUR TEETH.

262
00:11:39,664 --> 00:11:43,100
(Audience laughing)

263
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:46,604
YEAH, FRIENDS COME AND GO,
FAMILIES COME AND GO,

264
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:48,105
JOBS COME AND GO,

265
00:11:48,172 --> 00:11:50,541
BUT WHEN YOU'RE BUILT
LIKE I AM,

266
00:11:50,608 --> 00:11:54,111
YOU'LL USE THESE BABIES
FIVE, SIX TIMES A DAY.

267
00:11:54,178 --> 00:11:57,114
YOU FELLAS OUT THERE,
TAKE YOUR YOUNGSTERS ASIDE,

268
00:11:57,181 --> 00:12:00,151
SIT THEM DOWN AND SAY,
"TAKE CARE OF YOUR TEETH."

269
00:12:00,218 --> 00:12:03,621
WHAT THE HECK -- THEY'RE NOT
GONNA LISTEN TO YOU ANYWAY.

270
00:12:03,688 --> 00:12:05,990
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

271
00:12:06,057 --> 00:12:08,125
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

272
00:12:08,192 --> 00:12:11,562
(Laughing and applause)

273
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:12,897
HAROLD, LOOK AT THIS.

274
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:14,398
HOW MANY CARDS IN A DECK?

275
00:12:14,465 --> 00:12:15,967
LIKE, A NORMAL DECK?

276
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:17,602
A NORMAL DECK OF CARDS.

277
00:12:17,668 --> 00:12:20,071
IT DEPENDS,
'CAUSE IN A EUCHRE DECK,

278
00:12:20,137 --> 00:12:23,507
THERE'S LESS CARDS, RIGHT,
THAN IN A NORMAL DECK.

279
00:12:23,574 --> 00:12:26,911
CANASTA, THERE'S MORE CARDS
THAN IN A NORMAL DECK.

280
00:12:26,978 --> 00:12:28,579
THAT'S WEIRD, TOO, HUH?

281
00:12:28,646 --> 00:12:30,514
"OLD MAID", THEY'RE BIZARRE!

282
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:32,917
THEY GOT, LIKE,
THE SEVEN OF DONKEYS

283
00:12:32,984 --> 00:12:34,518
AND THE ACE OF DRAGONS.

284
00:12:34,585 --> 00:12:36,887
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON THERE!

285
00:12:36,954 --> 00:12:40,024
REGULAR DECKS SOMETIMES
HAVE TWO MORE CARDS.

286
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:42,426
THERE'S, LIKE,
AN INSTRUCTION CARD

287
00:12:42,493 --> 00:12:45,096
AND A WARRANTY CARD
AND A BLANK CARD.

288
00:12:45,162 --> 00:12:46,597
"IT'S A BLANK -- AHHHH!"

289
00:12:46,664 --> 00:12:48,099
FIFTY-TWO!

290
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:49,600
FIFTY-TWO CARDS.

291
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:51,769
REGULAR DECK, SURE, 52, YEAH.

292
00:12:51,836 --> 00:12:54,238
I COUNTED THE CARDS
WE PLAYED WITH.

293
00:12:54,305 --> 00:12:55,573
COMES TO 94.

294
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:56,941
NINETY-FOUR?!

295
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:59,977
THAT'S A LOT
OF EXTRA JOKERS.

296
00:13:00,044 --> 00:13:01,612
YEAH, 18 EXTRA.

297
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:02,947
MORE OR LESS,
YEAH.

298
00:13:03,014 --> 00:13:05,549
THAT'S NOT COUNTING
THESE, HAROLD.

299
00:13:05,616 --> 00:13:06,884
WHOA!

300
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:09,019
DID THE CARD TABLE
COME LIKE THAT?

301
00:13:09,086 --> 00:13:12,857
YOU CAME LIKE THAT,
SO I GUESS ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE.

302
00:13:12,923 --> 00:13:15,159
HAROLD, HERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

303
00:13:15,226 --> 00:13:18,362
STINKY HAPPENED TO BE SITTING
ON THIS SIDE.

304
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:21,232
STINKY HAPPENED TO WIN
THE ENTIRE POT.

305
00:13:21,298 --> 00:13:23,134
IT'S MORE THAN A COINCIDENCE.

306
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,069
HERE'S ANOTHER CLUE,
UNCLE RED.

307
00:13:25,136 --> 00:13:28,572
THESE CARDS ARE STUCK ON WITH
THAT WEIRD GUM STINKY CHEWS.

308
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,907
NO, THAT'S
HIS SALIVA.

309
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:31,575
WHOA-AH-OH!

310
00:13:31,642 --> 00:13:33,310
OHHHH!

311
00:13:37,314 --> 00:13:39,183
(Siren)

312
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:47,491
OHHH... POSSUM 9-1-1!

313
00:13:47,558 --> 00:13:50,594
STATE YOUR NAME
AND MEMBERSHIP NUMBER, PLEASE!

314
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:52,062
IT'S BUZZ SHERWOOD.

315
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:54,298
UM, I LOST MY MEMBERSHIP CARD

316
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:57,167
BUT I GOT A CARD
FROM THE VIDEO STORE.

317
00:13:57,234 --> 00:13:59,303
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH.

318
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,938
WHERE YOU CALLIN' FROM?

319
00:14:01,005 --> 00:14:02,640
THAT'S JUST IT, RED-MAN.

320
00:14:02,706 --> 00:14:05,142
I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM --
I'M LOST.

321
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:08,946
ARE YOU IN YOUR CAR
OR IN YOUR PLANE?

322
00:14:09,013 --> 00:14:10,447
LET ME CHECK.

323
00:14:10,514 --> 00:14:12,116
OHHH...

324
00:14:12,182 --> 00:14:14,118
UH... DINGLE BALLS...

325
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:16,120
GROUND'S SORT OF CLOSE...

326
00:14:16,186 --> 00:14:18,289
THAT MEANS HE'S IN HIS PLANE.

327
00:14:18,355 --> 00:14:19,657
I'M IN A CAR!

328
00:14:19,723 --> 00:14:21,358
HE'S IN A CAR?! WOW!

329
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:23,661
WHAT DO YOU SEE AROUND THERE?

330
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:25,729
UM... OH! TREES AND A HILL.

331
00:14:25,796 --> 00:14:28,065
IS THAT FAMILIAR TO YOU GUYS?

332
00:14:28,132 --> 00:14:31,335
IT'S HILLY AND TREE-Y.

333
00:14:31,402 --> 00:14:33,237
ARE THERE ANY PEOPLE AROUND?

334
00:14:33,304 --> 00:14:34,705
I SEE A GUY UP AHEAD.

335
00:14:34,772 --> 00:14:36,373
HE'S FIXING HIS MAILBOX.

336
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,576
OH, MAN, THAT'S THE ONE
I HIT EARLIER!

337
00:14:39,643 --> 00:14:42,379
I'M GOING AROUND
IN CIRCLES, RED.

338
00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:44,014
BUZZ, KEEP CALM, NOW.

339
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:46,450
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO UP
TO THAT GUY

340
00:14:46,517 --> 00:14:48,585
AND ASK HIM FOR DIRECTIONS.

341
00:14:48,652 --> 00:14:50,921
ASK... FOR DIRECTIONS?

342
00:14:50,988 --> 00:14:52,456
HOW DOES THAT WORK, MAN?

343
00:14:52,523 --> 00:14:54,458
DON'T PANIC, BUZZ,
DO NOT PANIC.

344
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:56,360
WE'LL COACH YOU THROUGH THIS.

345
00:14:56,427 --> 00:14:57,995
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, BUZZ.

346
00:14:58,062 --> 00:15:01,465
THE DIRECTIONS WILL BE
TOO COMPLICATED TO REMEMBER.

347
00:15:01,532 --> 00:15:04,034
LISTEN TO THE FIRST
FEW THINGS HE SAYS

348
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:07,438
AND GET AN IDEA OF
THE DIRECTION HE'S POINTING IN.

349
00:15:07,504 --> 00:15:11,408
KEEP NODDING YOUR HEAD UNTIL
HE SAYS, "YOU CAN'T MISS IT."

350
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:14,478
THEN JUST SAY, "SO I WAS RIGHT"
AND TAKE OFF.

351
00:15:14,545 --> 00:15:17,881
(Red): HERE WE ARE WITH
"ADVENTURES WITH BILL".

352
00:15:17,948 --> 00:15:21,485
I SAID WE WEREN'T GOING TO GO
WITH THE MECHANIZED,

353
00:15:21,552 --> 00:15:23,020
BUT LOOK WHAT WE GOT.

354
00:15:23,086 --> 00:15:24,455
LOOK AT THAT THING.

355
00:15:24,521 --> 00:15:25,956
THIS IS SOMETHING

356
00:15:26,023 --> 00:15:28,659
YOU YOUNGSTERS
MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN.

357
00:15:28,725 --> 00:15:30,727
BILL STARTED AS A YOUNGSTER,

358
00:15:30,794 --> 00:15:33,697
I BELIEVE HE HAD THE MACHANO
AND THE LEGO

359
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:35,766
AND THE VARIOUS OTHER "O's".

360
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,402
AND NOW HE'S GRADUATED
UP THE LADDER--

361
00:15:38,468 --> 00:15:39,903
WE'LL NOT A LADDER.

362
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,605
IT'S A STICK BOOM.

363
00:15:41,672 --> 00:15:44,308
WHAT THEY FIND WITH THAT IS,

364
00:15:44,374 --> 00:15:46,376
AS IN SO MANY EXAMPLES
OF LIFE,

365
00:15:46,443 --> 00:15:48,946
YOU MECHANIZE THINGS
AND GET A MACHINE

366
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:51,748
THAT CAN DO THE WORK
OF FOUR OR FIVE MEN.

367
00:15:51,815 --> 00:15:53,717
I DON'T KNOW WHO THE MEN ARE

368
00:15:53,784 --> 00:15:55,619
IN THIS CASE --
NOT RIGHT MEN.

369
00:15:55,686 --> 00:16:00,357
BUT YOU CAN PICK THE FRUIT
NOT JUST FROM THE UNDERNEATH,

370
00:16:00,424 --> 00:16:04,428
BUT FROM THE SIDES
AND ALSO THE TOP OF THE TREE.

371
00:16:04,494 --> 00:16:05,829
JUST GRAB THAT

372
00:16:05,896 --> 00:16:08,465
AND... ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,

373
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:12,536
NOW, IN THE MANUAL IT SAYS
DON'T GRAB THAT LEVER TOO HARD

374
00:16:12,603 --> 00:16:15,772
BECAUSE IT HAS A TENDENCY
TO COME OUT, AND

375
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,709
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO
A LOT OF FRUIT-PICKING

376
00:16:18,775 --> 00:16:20,210
UP IN THAT AREA.

377
00:16:20,277 --> 00:16:22,212
TRY OVER BY THE BARN.

378
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:23,847
OH!

379
00:16:23,914 --> 00:16:26,917
CAN YOU CLIMB--
NO HE CAN'T.

380
00:16:26,984 --> 00:16:28,418
THERE WE GO!

381
00:16:28,485 --> 00:16:31,154
HAROLD, THERE'S NO BOTTOM
IN THAT.

382
00:16:31,221 --> 00:16:32,990
OH BOY, HE'S UP THERE.

383
00:16:33,056 --> 00:16:36,593
WELL, THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE
OF MACHINERY

384
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,729
HELPING US THROUGH LIFE.

385
00:16:38,795 --> 00:16:40,731
I GUESS IT'S THE END
OF HIS SHIFT.

386
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:42,232
GOT HIM, HAROLD?

387
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:43,734
OH, LOST HIM IN THE SUN.

388
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,235
OH BOY.

389
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:47,404
OH BOY.

390
00:16:47,471 --> 00:16:48,905
OW!

391
00:16:48,972 --> 00:16:53,643
HERE'S A STUFFED CAT FROM
WTVP-47 IN PEORIA.

392
00:16:58,415 --> 00:17:01,151
(Audience laughing)

393
00:17:01,218 --> 00:17:05,355
(Laughing)

394
00:17:05,422 --> 00:17:08,492
GOT TOO MUCH STARCH
IN YOUR SHIRT?

395
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:11,328
GOT THE CHEATING PROBLEM
ALL STRAIGHTENED OUT

396
00:17:11,394 --> 00:17:14,131
AND I'M ALL SET
FOR THE REMATCH WITH STINKY.

397
00:17:14,197 --> 00:17:15,465
JUST THE TWO OF US,

398
00:17:15,532 --> 00:17:17,667
EYEBALL TO EYEBALL,
WINNER TAKE ALL.

399
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:19,002
AWW, COOL!

400
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:22,873
YEAH, LIKE BRETT MAVERICK,
FRONTIER GAMBLER, HUH?

401
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:24,641
OR PAUL NEWMAN IN "THE STING"?

402
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,409
REMEMBER? HE PLAYED POKER

403
00:17:26,476 --> 00:17:28,678
AGAINST ROBERT SHAW
IN THE TRAIN.

404
00:17:28,745 --> 00:17:32,015
HE WAS HENRY GONDORF
AND HE BURPED REALLY LOUD.

405
00:17:32,082 --> 00:17:33,917
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED?

406
00:17:33,984 --> 00:17:35,418
A GOOD POKER FACE.

407
00:17:35,485 --> 00:17:37,053
I DON'T HAVE ONE.

408
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,057
BRING IT HERE AND
LET ME POKE IT FOR YOU.

409
00:17:41,124 --> 00:17:43,393
HOW ARE YOU GONNA BEAT STINKY?

410
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,161
YOU BEEN TAKING
POKER LESSONS?

411
00:17:45,228 --> 00:17:46,663
I DON'T NEED LESSONS.

412
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,164
YOU DO,
BECAUSE--

413
00:17:48,231 --> 00:17:50,667
OH, MAN!

414
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:52,669
YOU WERE
GONNA CHEAT!

415
00:17:52,736 --> 00:17:54,204
NO, HAROLD.

416
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:55,538
HE WAS GONNA CHEAT!

417
00:17:55,605 --> 00:17:56,873
NO, HAROLD.

418
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,910
IT'S NO WONDER
MY GENERATION'S SO CYNICAL.

419
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:03,179
I HOPE YOU ARE VERY PROUD
OF YOURSELF, YOUNG MAN.

420
00:18:03,246 --> 00:18:04,681
GOTTA GO,
HAROLD.

421
00:18:04,748 --> 00:18:07,117
YOU GOT CARDS IN YOUR PANTS!

422
00:18:07,183 --> 00:18:08,618
(Audience laughing)

423
00:18:08,685 --> 00:18:11,121
LOOKS LIKE A STRAIGHT FLUSH.

424
00:18:11,187 --> 00:18:13,123
NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO.

425
00:18:13,189 --> 00:18:15,125
NO, HAROLD, NO!

426
00:18:15,191 --> 00:18:16,626
FULL HOUSE.

427
00:18:16,693 --> 00:18:19,195
(Audience laughing)

428
00:18:22,432 --> 00:18:26,102
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT PORTION
OF THE SHOW,

429
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:29,639
WHERE WE EXAMINE THOSE WORDS
THAT MEN FIND SO DIFFICULT.

430
00:18:29,706 --> 00:18:31,141
(Audience):
"I DON'T KNOW!"

431
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:33,843
OK, JOINING MY UNCLE RED
THIS WEEK

432
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:37,747
IS HIS BEST FRIEND
IN THE WHOLE ROOM, LOCAL ROOFER

433
00:18:37,814 --> 00:18:40,150
ARNIE DOGAN!

434
00:18:40,216 --> 00:18:42,419
(Howling)

435
00:18:42,485 --> 00:18:44,254
THIS WEEK'S
LETTER

436
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,822
GOES
AS FOLLOWS.

437
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:49,526
"DEAR EXPERTS, I HAVE A STRING
OF UNSUCCESSFUL CAREERS.

438
00:18:49,592 --> 00:18:51,928
"I WAS A UREA FORMALDEHYDE
SALESMAN.

439
00:18:51,995 --> 00:18:54,064
"I INVESTED MY SAVINGS IN POGS,

440
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,033
"THINKING THEY COULD ONLY
INCREASE IN VALUE.

441
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,003
"CURRENTLY, I'M A TRAVEL AGENT
FOR VALUJET.

442
00:19:00,069 --> 00:19:03,506
"IS THE WHOLE WORLD
AGAINST ME OR WHAT?"

443
00:19:03,573 --> 00:19:06,209
BEFORE THE WORLD'S
GONNA BE AGAINST YOU,

444
00:19:06,276 --> 00:19:08,011
YOU MUST MEET MORE PEOPLE.

445
00:19:08,077 --> 00:19:09,345
JUST ASK HAROLD.

446
00:19:09,412 --> 00:19:10,880
HEY!

447
00:19:10,947 --> 00:19:12,382
(Audience laughing)

448
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:15,552
IN MY EXPERIENCE,
THE WORLD IS NEVER AGAINST YA.

449
00:19:15,618 --> 00:19:17,120
IN THE ROOFING BUSINESS,

450
00:19:17,187 --> 00:19:19,522
YOU ONLY GOT
THREE NATURAL ENEMIES --

451
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:21,591
WIND, GRAVITY,
AND WET SHINGLES.

452
00:19:21,658 --> 00:19:23,893
HOW IS THE LEG,
MR. DOGAN?

453
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,962
THEY WERE GONNA PUT
A STEEL PIN IN,

454
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:28,031
BUT I ALREADY GOT ALUMINUM
IN THERE

455
00:19:28,097 --> 00:19:31,234
FROM WHEN I LANDED ON BUSTER
HADFIELD'S T.V. ANTENNA.

456
00:19:31,301 --> 00:19:33,436
OHHH.

457
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,471
NOBODY AT DOGAN
AND SONS ROOFING

458
00:19:35,538 --> 00:19:37,874
COMPLAINS THAT
THE WORLD'S AGAINST US.

459
00:19:37,941 --> 00:19:41,177
WHEN MY DAD DROPPED 60 FEET
ONTO THAT FORD FAIRLANE,

460
00:19:41,244 --> 00:19:43,580
HE WAS JUST GLAD
IT WAS A CONVERTIBLE.

461
00:19:43,646 --> 00:19:46,549
THE DRIVER WASN'T
TOO THRILLED ABOUT IT.

462
00:19:46,616 --> 00:19:48,051
NO.

463
00:19:48,117 --> 00:19:49,552
NEITHER WAS HIS WIDOW.

464
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:50,887
YEAH.

465
00:19:50,954 --> 00:19:52,288
IT'S A HEALTHY ATTITUDE.

466
00:19:52,355 --> 00:19:54,457
YOU'RE TAKING RESPONSIBILITY
FOR LIFE.

467
00:19:54,524 --> 00:19:55,792
THAT'S IT, YEAH.

468
00:19:55,858 --> 00:19:58,595
I WROTE A SONG ABOUT THAT
FOR MY NEXT C.D.

469
00:19:58,661 --> 00:19:59,929
YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO!

470
00:19:59,996 --> 00:20:02,465
ON THE DOGAN LABEL
FROM DOGAN DISTRIBUTING.

471
00:20:02,532 --> 00:20:04,167
THE ALBUM COMES OUT
WHEN WE GET

472
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:06,336
THAT ROOFING CONTRACT
AT THE COMMUNITY CENTRE.

473
00:20:06,402 --> 00:20:07,670
(Clearing throat)

474
00:20:07,737 --> 00:20:10,173
GOES LIKE THIS...

475
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:11,541
NO, I'VE HEARD IT.

476
00:20:11,607 --> 00:20:13,643
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THIS ONE.

477
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,678
THIS IS A SPECIAL NEW ONE.

478
00:20:15,745 --> 00:20:20,850
WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE A TOAD
ON THE HIGHWAY OF LIFE

479
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:26,856
AND EVERYONE SEEMS LIKE
A STEEL-BELTED RADIAL

480
00:20:26,923 --> 00:20:29,792
WHEN YOU'RE LYIN' THERE
SQUISHED

481
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:32,695
IN AN ASSORTMENT
OF BODY FLUIDS

482
00:20:32,762 --> 00:20:36,699
HEY, AT LEAST
YOU LEFT YOUR MARK

483
00:20:36,766 --> 00:20:38,201
(Laughing and applause)

484
00:20:38,267 --> 00:20:39,569
THANK YOU.

485
00:20:39,635 --> 00:20:43,706
(Applause)

486
00:20:43,773 --> 00:20:47,710
WELL, I CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE
 THAT
 VIDEO.

487
00:20:47,777 --> 00:20:49,679
OOOH!

488
00:20:49,746 --> 00:20:53,216
(Harold singing
quietly)

489
00:20:53,282 --> 00:20:54,884
(Audience laughing)

490
00:20:54,951 --> 00:20:56,052
THE GOOD NEWS

491
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:59,188
IS, WHATEVER GOES AROUND,
COMES AROUND.

492
00:20:59,255 --> 00:21:02,692
I WON BACK EVERYTHING I LOST
IN THE POKER GAME.

493
00:21:02,758 --> 00:21:05,394
SHAME, SHAME --
HOW ABOUT YOUR HONOUR?

494
00:21:05,461 --> 00:21:08,331
YOU LOST THAT
WHEN YOU DECIDED TO CHEAT.

495
00:21:08,397 --> 00:21:10,566
I WAS FIGHTING FIRE WITH FIRE.

496
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:12,502
NO, YOU WERE FIGHTING FIRE

497
00:21:12,568 --> 00:21:14,170
WITH ACES IN
YOUR UNDERWEAR.

498
00:21:14,237 --> 00:21:15,505
SHAME, SHAME!

499
00:21:15,571 --> 00:21:16,906
YOU PROFITED
BY DECEIT.

500
00:21:16,973 --> 00:21:18,474
I DIDN'T PROFIT, HAROLD.

501
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,810
I JUST BROKE EVEN,
PLUS A LITTLE BIT.

502
00:21:20,877 --> 00:21:23,012
WE GOT A NEW AGREEMENT
ON CHEATING.

503
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:25,214
YOU CAN ONLY BRING
FIVE EXTRA CARDS

504
00:21:25,281 --> 00:21:27,416
AND YOU GOTTA USE THEM
IN ONE HAND.

505
00:21:27,483 --> 00:21:28,751
(Possum squeal)

506
00:21:28,818 --> 00:21:30,286
MEETING TIME, UNCLE RED.

507
00:21:30,353 --> 00:21:32,755
TOO BAD YOU FEEL BAD
ABOUT CHEATING.

508
00:21:32,822 --> 00:21:35,491
I WAS GONNA GIVE YOU 10%
OF MY WINNINGS.

509
00:21:35,558 --> 00:21:37,693
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, I UNDERSTAND.

510
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,929
NO, I'M FROWNING
ON IT.

511
00:21:39,996 --> 00:21:42,331
I'M FROWNING --
THIS IS A FROWN.

512
00:21:42,398 --> 00:21:44,200
10% IS VERY GENEROUS OF YOU.

513
00:21:44,267 --> 00:21:45,534
REALLY?

514
00:21:45,601 --> 00:21:48,404
YEAH, SO I DON'T WANT
TO BE RUDE.

515
00:21:48,471 --> 00:21:50,206
HERE YOU GO.

516
00:21:50,273 --> 00:21:52,208
ENJOY.

517
00:21:52,275 --> 00:21:53,743
TOOTHPICKS!

518
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:55,144
YEAH, TOOTHPICKS, YEAH.

519
00:21:55,211 --> 00:21:56,979
YOU'RE PLAYING
FOR TOOTHPICKS!

520
00:21:57,046 --> 00:21:58,848
I THOUGHT YOU
PLAYED FOR MONEY.

521
00:21:58,914 --> 00:22:01,217
YOU GOTTA HAVE MONEY
TO PLAY FOR MONEY.

522
00:22:01,283 --> 00:22:06,122
TOOTHPICKS IN YOUR POCKET'S
A REAL KILLER.

523
00:22:06,188 --> 00:22:08,791
OOH, THEY'RE ALL USED!

524
00:22:08,858 --> 00:22:10,126
MAN, I WAS ROLLIN'.

525
00:22:10,192 --> 00:22:12,561
I COULD HAVE WON
STINKY'S MATCHES, TOO,

526
00:22:12,628 --> 00:22:14,430
BUT HE'S GOT THE WOOD STOVE.

527
00:22:14,497 --> 00:22:16,165
DIDN'T WANT HIM TO FREEZE.

528
00:22:16,232 --> 00:22:17,500
YOU GO AHEAD, HAROLD.

529
00:22:17,566 --> 00:22:18,834
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

530
00:22:18,901 --> 00:22:20,169
TOOTHPICKS!

531
00:22:20,236 --> 00:22:22,805
DON'T SPEND THEM ALL
ON ONE MOUTH!

532
00:22:22,872 --> 00:22:25,641
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,
I'M COMING STRAIGHT HOME.

533
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,344
IF YOU HEAR I WAS CHEATING,
IT WAS DURING POKER

534
00:22:28,411 --> 00:22:31,347
SO DON'T THINK ABOUT THINGS
TO DO TO A SLEEPING MAN

535
00:22:31,414 --> 00:22:32,681
WITH 12,000 TOOTHPICKS.

536
00:22:32,748 --> 00:22:35,384
THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

537
00:22:35,451 --> 00:22:38,621
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND HAROLD AND THE GANG,

538
00:22:38,687 --> 00:22:40,689
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

539
00:22:40,756 --> 00:22:47,196
(Applause and cheering)

540
00:22:47,263 --> 00:22:56,205
(Possum squeal)

541
00:22:56,272 --> 00:22:57,740
(Harold): ALL RISE!

542
00:22:57,807 --> 00:22:59,208
UP! UP AND AT 'EM!

543
00:22:59,275 --> 00:23:00,709
(Red): OK.

544
00:23:00,776 --> 00:23:03,212
ALL RIGHT.

545
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:06,649
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

546
00:23:06,715 --> 00:23:07,983
(Red): SIT DOWN.

547
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,653
I HAVE A HAPPY ANNOUNCEMENT
FOR YOU.

548
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:14,557
OLD MAN SEDGWICK, WHO WON
THE FOUR CASES OF WHISKEY

549
00:23:14,623 --> 00:23:17,193
AT CHRISTMAS, IS NOW
UP AND AROUND AGAIN.
