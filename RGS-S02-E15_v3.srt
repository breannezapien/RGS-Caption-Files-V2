1
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:43,743
Live from the depths of the wilderness where
they can't see the forest for Louise, it's

2
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:48,982
the red green show starring the man the
Indians call the old guy who drives that ugly

3
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:53,086
van on TV that we see the greatest living
woodsman since Davy Crockett.

4
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,787
And he's buried now.

5
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,155
So there you go on that one.

6
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,993
Ladies and gentlemen, your friend and my
uncle, the star of the Red Green Show.

7
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,427
Here he is now, ladies and gentlemen.

8
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:04,230
Mr. Red Green Guy.

9
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,135
Thank you, and I welcome the Possum Lodge.

10
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,437
I'm red green, the head of the head of the
Lodge.

11
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,239
It's a job that I don't take lightly, but
should.

12
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:17,543
Harold is not only my nephew, he's also my
producer and director.

13
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,646
And that means I can do stuff like this.

14
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:24,951
But he's not much of a nephew, either.

15
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:27,120
Anyway, had an interesting wake up at the
lodge.

16
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:30,890
The guys decided to take up birdwatching,
which we always used to think of as kind of a

17
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:35,428
sissy thing to do. But then they found out
that birdwatchers carry wind skins and and

18
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,597
they don't get accidentally shot, so it
sounded pretty good.

19
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:40,533
Plus, the guys figured they can do it
sitting on the couch by the big picture

20
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:45,204
window. And any sport that happens close to
the fridge is real popular at Possum Lodge.

21
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:46,539
Wow, that's great.

22
00:01:46,572 --> 00:01:48,007
How many different birds have they seen?

23
00:01:48,207 --> 00:01:53,046
Well, as of this morning, two hundred and
seventy nine stinky, you wanted to be able to

24
00:01:53,312 --> 00:01:54,814
count the eggs in the omelet this morning.

25
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,649
But oh man, Cedric said no eggs.

26
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,218
It was too hard to look at two hundred.

27
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,254
Wow, that's amazing.

28
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,956
Well, you know, takes birdwatchers years to
see that money.

29
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,425
They saw him just in a few days.

30
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,027
Wow, that's incredible to see that many
different species.

31
00:02:08,694 --> 00:02:09,962
How do you mean different species?

32
00:02:10,596 --> 00:02:12,331
Well, you know, different. Not the same.

33
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:13,866
You know, like yellow breasted.

34
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:16,369
So and so's and red throated doohickey.

35
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,538
Oh wow. I don't know without hair.

36
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:21,908
I know they like they saw 47 birds at once
when a flock of seagulls went through last

37
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:22,608
night's garbage.

38
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:26,179
Oh no. Uncle Red, you don't count the
individual birds.

39
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,014
You count the individual species.

40
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:30,449
Oh oh of.

41
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:33,085
Then they haven't seen two hundred and
seventy nine birds.

42
00:02:33,085 --> 00:02:33,786
They've seen

43
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:35,755
Three

44
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,391
Point and then they kind of upset.

45
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,126
They may drop birdwatching when they find.

46
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:44,463
Find out about this. What about what about
sucking back on wine skins?

47
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:47,600
You know, is that a sport you're like like
an armchair athlete would do well?

48
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,769
Yeah. Well, like wine tasting, maybe.

49
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,738
Yeah. But you know, you can't just like,
slosh it down.

50
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:57,610
You got to like, you got to sniff the
bouquet, enjoy the color, study it.

51
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:02,448
If you will sniff the cork, take a little
swill of wine into your mouth, winch it

52
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,350
around and then just spit it out.

53
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:07,086
Oh, you spit it out. Well, that's a food
fight.

54
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,521
That's got to be a sport.

55
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,257
Well, yeah, OK.

56
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:12,425
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:12,758
Yeah.

58
00:03:23,602 --> 00:03:26,973
Excellent that you write that.

59
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,941
No, no sign of him anywhere, Dr.

60
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:31,043
Murray. Oh, Bill, this is great.

61
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,378
My backside tingling.

62
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,047
Let your hands do. And he hit some man with
a baseball bat.

63
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:43,289
Well, you got to try this doc, you know,
what's up?

64
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:47,626
I ordered a new fish locator to restore a
fish locator.

65
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,762
Oh yeah, that sort of takes the sport

66
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:55,401
Out of it. And I hope, though, it's the kind
of sonar looking to analyze the maybe.

67
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,909
Outside it outside

68
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:04,443
To do that.

69
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:10,282
Look, I didn't know you were in the Navy
Dock.

70
00:04:10,749 --> 00:04:12,251
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

71
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,620
Medical officer on the first solar powered
submarine.

72
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:17,056
Very hush hush.

73
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:22,194
The whole thing. Oh yeah, it was the the
world's first environmentally friendly sub

74
00:04:22,194 --> 00:04:25,264
world. Mm hmm. None of your nuclear power
for us.

75
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:29,201
No, sir. Just a sun powered sub carrying 20
ICBM.

76
00:04:30,402 --> 00:04:31,537
That's amazing.

77
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,739
Oh, you look me right in the eye when you
said that.

78
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,007
Of course. Louisa Morris.

79
00:04:35,374 --> 00:04:36,642
Well, there it is, Harold.

80
00:04:36,675 --> 00:04:38,511
Oh, come to Papa PBB.

81
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:41,080
Be careful with that. Come on. We have we we
haven't gotten paid for that yet.

82
00:04:41,113 --> 00:04:43,849
All right. Good. Ok, I want you to go get
that battery from out of the truck.

83
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:45,918
All right. Out Trout.

84
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:46,986
The doctor is in.

85
00:04:47,753 --> 00:04:49,321
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

86
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,857
I think a little money needs to change hands
right now.

87
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,525
Oh hey, relax, Murray.

88
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:55,694
I'll pay you back on the fish I catch.

89
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,596
Oh hey, you said it in paper itself?

90
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,532
Well, I did say that I think it'll pay for
itself to you.

91
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:02,067
No, I'm not that lucky.

92
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:03,269
I need that money up front.

93
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:06,305
How am I going to catch fish without a fish
locator?

94
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,040
How do you normally catch fish?

95
00:05:08,073 --> 00:05:13,679
He normally doesn't. Oh, well, I'll be
outside if anybody's looking for me.

96
00:05:15,547 --> 00:05:17,082
I got the battery out of the truck.

97
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:22,021
Oh, not that battery, the little
rechargeable battery and the shiny new box on

98
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:27,926
the front seat. Oh well, now come on.

99
00:05:27,926 --> 00:05:29,328
Don't go taking that thing back, Murray.

100
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:31,563
You're never going to sell it. I'm just
going to want to buy it, huh?

101
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,767
All right. So why don't you just let me use
it until I earn the money to pay for it?

102
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,136
Hey, Doc, your fish locator come

103
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:42,941
There that came in, came and went, came and
went, Yeah, red.

104
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:44,610
Can I borrow three hundred dollars?

105
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:46,345
Sure. Not for me, though.

106
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:54,686
Ok, who'd like an order of fresh piping hot
from the oven cheese dreams?

107
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,355
Those are cheese nightmares, Eddie.

108
00:05:57,923 --> 00:06:03,061
Oh, how about a cheese, Jim Murray?

109
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:05,230
Oh no. Thanks, Eddie, I'm driving Doc.

110
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,865
Can I get? Yeah. Hmm.

111
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,902
Well, if I ate one, would you give me $300?

112
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:11,436
Wow.

113
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,872
Say yes. You'll never live to collect it.

114
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:19,111
Got him, Duane.

115
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:20,846
Care for a snack? Sure.

116
00:06:21,947 --> 00:06:27,152
See you, ED. Remember you and I were talking
about me getting you a good supply of fresh

117
00:06:27,152 --> 00:06:31,557
fish. How would you be willing to pay
handsomely for said supply?

118
00:06:32,257 --> 00:06:35,160
Well, I was wondering if I could get an
advance on that.

119
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:41,900
Well, I mean, I I really could use some
Atlantic salmon or some Pacific lobster meat,

120
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:44,803
so I could make it. I could make a salmon
patty.

121
00:06:45,837 --> 00:06:48,240
Well, I was thinking more of a fish out of
the lake.

122
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:53,011
Possibly. You mean those scrappy little bass
and sunfish?

123
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:56,481
I mean, they are so full of chemicals.

124
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:59,451
If you drive them off, you can throw them in
the fire and use them for artificial lungs.

125
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:01,386
So these are great tuna puffs.

126
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,188
Cheese dreams.

127
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:09,127
Sunny, very funny.

128
00:07:09,995 --> 00:07:11,897
Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold up, hold up.

129
00:07:12,197 --> 00:07:13,899
Brett, read the lodge, could you?

130
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:18,036
The fish locator, huh? Hey, I'm sure we got
it for three hundred bucks in the kitty

131
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:18,537
somewhere.

132
00:07:19,037 --> 00:07:20,772
Well, we would have you paid your dues
anyway.

133
00:07:22,374 --> 00:07:23,475
That's between you and Murray.

134
00:07:24,176 --> 00:07:27,079
All right. You can have your fish locator as
soon as you find your money locator.

135
00:07:27,112 --> 00:07:28,413
All right. I need that.

136
00:07:28,947 --> 00:07:30,716
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

137
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:32,217
Lovely to look at potato hole.

138
00:07:32,217 --> 00:07:34,086
You break this thing and it's sold to you.

139
00:07:34,252 --> 00:07:43,228
But. You promised to buy my fish.

140
00:07:43,762 --> 00:07:45,564
You promised to eat the cheese dream.

141
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,481
Of all the smells that are known to man.

142
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:07,886
There's nothing like home cooking that can
do things and nothing else can.

143
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,156
The smell of home cooking can get you out of
bed.

144
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:15,527
The smell of home cooking, getting raise you
from the half dead.

145
00:08:17,062 --> 00:08:20,365
I remember one day our house burned down

146
00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:21,199
Down

147
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:25,570
And you could smell our home cooking all the
way to town.

148
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:30,609
Hi.

149
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,017
This week on

150
00:08:39,017 --> 00:08:42,787
Andy My Corner, I want to show you how to
check your transmission.

151
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:49,928
I got this engine out of my vehicle here
when I tried to do an oil change and luckily

152
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:53,098
enough, the transmission come with it so we
can take advantage of that now.

153
00:08:54,432 --> 00:08:56,267
The first step here to get the training off.

154
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:59,437
Call it a tranny is to loosen the bolts.

155
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:08,647
All right. Now I bring the trainees down
here at this end.

156
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,781
Yeah, yeah. Here we go.

157
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:17,956
Ok, now these are these are a nine 16 volt,
but this is only a half inch wrench.

158
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:19,324
I think we can make it work.

159
00:09:24,662 --> 00:09:31,236
Ok, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, well, now it would
it does help if you got somebody to kind of

160
00:09:31,536 --> 00:09:33,138
study the motor.

161
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,841
Oh, wait, I'm at. The other end of this is
nine 16.

162
00:09:36,975 --> 00:09:40,979
Ok. Ok. Whoa.

163
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:42,013
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

164
00:09:48,987 --> 00:09:54,793
Ok, now I wasn't exactly sure everything
which bolts held the transmission on, so I I

165
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:57,562
just pretty well undid everything I could
find.

166
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:02,734
I just kind of pried us out of here.

167
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:08,006
Come on.

168
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:10,975
I got it here.

169
00:10:16,414 --> 00:10:19,250
Just OK.

170
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:22,053
Ok. Ok. All right.

171
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,531
Let's get this off then.

172
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:37,101
Ok, let's see what we got here.

173
00:10:37,568 --> 00:10:38,870
Ok. We got a.

174
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:43,174
And that seems all right, and I have one of
these.

175
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,714
This this year, this doesn't look no, no, I
guess that's OK.

176
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:53,284
Yeah. These and this and this.

177
00:10:54,786 --> 00:10:56,087
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.

178
00:10:56,421 --> 00:10:58,556
And this seems. Yep, yep.

179
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,926
Well, it looks OK.

180
00:11:02,226 --> 00:11:07,765
So I would say if you take your transmission
apart and take a look at this and then take a

181
00:11:07,765 --> 00:11:09,701
look at yours and whatever, it doesn't look
like this.

182
00:11:09,701 --> 00:11:13,004
Make yours look like this and and then
you'll be OK.

183
00:11:13,738 --> 00:11:17,575
So until next time, women don't find a
handsome, they should at least find your

184
00:11:17,575 --> 00:11:22,013
handy. Does anybody know if this is the
transmission?

185
00:11:51,576 --> 00:11:55,746
It is winter. It's only half over, and
you've gone through almost all of your

186
00:11:55,746 --> 00:11:59,450
firewood, all because your wife won't wear
wool socks.

187
00:12:06,157 --> 00:12:09,927
Man, bad enough, I got the bank, the
government and the in-laws begging me for

188
00:12:09,927 --> 00:12:12,096
money. Now I got Doc Render hit me up for a
loan.

189
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,097
You know, Uncle

190
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:16,133
Fred, I'd be happy to give Doc the money, but
all you have to do is just, you know, give me

191
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:16,734
a raise.

192
00:12:17,368 --> 00:12:20,438
All right. What about this here? Why don't I
give you a cut in pay and then doc and lend

193
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:20,972
you money?

194
00:12:20,972 --> 00:12:24,308
Or even this will just keep things status quo
ish the way they're working now,

195
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:26,043
And I could work with that.

196
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,647
Yeah. Well, I thought you might be able to
help anyway.

197
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,349
Doc was just hitting up. Absolutely
everybody.

198
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:35,920
Oh man. Sedgwick said he couldn't partake
because he's got his money tied up in pork

199
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,925
futures, which basically means he's bought
bacon for tomorrow's breakfast and steak.

200
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:42,460
He's got all his money in one of his old
socks.

201
00:12:43,094 --> 00:12:46,097
The doc said he'd even take that as long as
Stinky washed it first.

202
00:12:46,097 --> 00:12:48,666
But he said, No, I didn't want to give them
laundered money.

203
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:50,301
That's disgusting.

204
00:12:50,935 --> 00:12:51,969
A fish locator.

205
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:53,871
Ok, where's our priorities?

206
00:12:53,871 --> 00:12:55,973
Uncle Ray? Where's your priorities?

207
00:12:56,507 --> 00:12:57,975
Mine. Well, they're not important.

208
00:12:58,476 --> 00:13:00,011
Are we making educational tools for our
children?

209
00:13:00,444 --> 00:13:01,846
I think not, sir.

210
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:06,083
No. Rather, we're making these silly, flashy
gadgets that we don't even need.

211
00:13:06,117 --> 00:13:07,852
We're wasting our technological advances.

212
00:13:07,885 --> 00:13:09,854
We could be saving lives.

213
00:13:10,187 --> 00:13:12,022
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I could get on with the
show, lil.

214
00:13:12,056 --> 00:13:13,057
Yeah, OK, you got to see this one.

215
00:13:13,057 --> 00:13:13,691
This is so cool.

216
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:17,261
I just discovered it. Oh, cool.

217
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:18,195
What part?

218
00:13:18,262 --> 00:13:19,397
Cool. Oh yeah.

219
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,965
Yeah, that machine is a real lifesaver.

220
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:24,268
Anything out there?

221
00:13:24,602 --> 00:13:26,036
Oh, I don't know.

222
00:13:26,237 --> 00:13:29,240
I'm awful busy. I've got to get a snack
ready for the bird watchers.

223
00:13:30,407 --> 00:13:32,209
What is that black pudding or licorice
pancakes?

224
00:13:33,544 --> 00:13:36,480
Toast little on the burnt side, isn't it,
that

225
00:13:38,983 --> 00:13:39,683
People would ask me?

226
00:13:40,551 --> 00:13:44,088
No, no, no, no. Actually, I was wondering
about this deal you got with Doc to pay for

227
00:13:44,088 --> 00:13:47,892
his fish locator. No, I don't think Doc can
catch anything other than suckers, you know

228
00:13:47,892 --> 00:13:48,225
what I mean?

229
00:13:52,496 --> 00:13:53,664
Don't worry about that.

230
00:13:53,898 --> 00:13:55,132
No, the deal's off.

231
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:58,335
We couldn't come to an agreement. Oh, it was
not funny

232
00:13:59,803 --> 00:14:01,238
At that time was not turned on.

233
00:14:01,238 --> 00:14:01,639
You know that?

234
00:14:02,306 --> 00:14:05,042
Oh, well, they're like, Oh my cake.

235
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:14,652
Oh, well, a little bit icing, you know,
nobody will notice.

236
00:14:15,386 --> 00:14:17,288
Yeah. Well, it goes good with the toast now,
anyway.

237
00:14:18,188 --> 00:14:18,589
The toast.

238
00:14:19,223 --> 00:14:26,430
My toast. A little butter in.

239
00:14:26,997 --> 00:14:27,698
Nobody will notice.

240
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:29,933
I guess not, no.

241
00:14:31,035 --> 00:14:34,938
You know, I must have lost my concentration
while I was poking little holes in the

242
00:14:34,938 --> 00:14:35,873
bratwurst sausage.

243
00:14:36,674 --> 00:14:37,608
And I missed that.

244
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:40,077
Well, you were standing right there, red.

245
00:14:40,577 --> 00:14:44,148
You see, you have to poke holes in about
where sausage, otherwise they'll explode.

246
00:14:44,148 --> 00:14:45,082
Everybody knows that.

247
00:14:46,316 --> 00:14:47,351
I don't think he did it. It.

248
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:50,087
I poked holes in the sausage.

249
00:14:50,821 --> 00:14:54,858
So little ketchup.

250
00:14:56,093 --> 00:14:56,760
Nobody noticed.

251
00:14:59,496 --> 00:15:01,665
Bell told me to meet him behind the line.

252
00:15:01,732 --> 00:15:03,300
There is going to show me how to camouflage
himself.

253
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:06,303
I don't know. Well.

254
00:15:08,272 --> 00:15:09,540
By golly, he's pretty good at it.

255
00:15:12,443 --> 00:15:15,712
So that's what we're going to do on this
week's adventures with Bill.

256
00:15:17,781 --> 00:15:22,920
I was looking at a tree you used and there
was an apple in there and Adam and Eve kind

257
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:28,292
of a relationship we had at that moment that
Apolo and I brought in these cans of spray

258
00:15:28,292 --> 00:15:31,895
paint. You had the white coveralls on and
the lid was kind of stuck on mine.

259
00:15:32,796 --> 00:15:38,168
There we go. Now what he does is just to
kind of spray paint some random patterns all

260
00:15:38,168 --> 00:15:39,970
over his coveralls. He asked me to do the
back.

261
00:15:40,637 --> 00:15:42,706
I'm only too happy to help out on these.

262
00:15:43,473 --> 00:15:45,175
Hoping it'll mean they'll end sooner.

263
00:15:46,076 --> 00:15:50,347
But he's got he had, I guess, two colors
nine and then we switch colors around that

264
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,283
sort of can't really tell that in the in the
black and white, but those are different

265
00:15:53,283 --> 00:15:58,222
colors. And I was done and he was done, and
there he was.

266
00:15:58,322 --> 00:16:00,057
I did a little different style in mine, but

267
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:02,025
I like it.

268
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:06,964
Now we're going to make some camouflage our
hats so you can't see our heads.

269
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:10,801
He's got to have something like mine, but
course not exactly the same as my lucky hat,

270
00:16:10,801 --> 00:16:15,772
but in some ranches around there and I
thought I did kind of a nice job on mine and

271
00:16:16,473 --> 00:16:19,810
bills. Well. You know, it was built.

272
00:16:21,712 --> 00:16:25,649
We're ready to go out through the long grass
and whatever, and you how difficult it is to

273
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:28,518
spot a person moving like that.

274
00:16:30,253 --> 00:16:31,655
Bill feels a little easier.

275
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,826
And this is something I had never
experienced before.

276
00:16:35,892 --> 00:16:40,797
You just put a mirror into the tall grass
and then you can you can know what you do is

277
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:47,437
you angle it in such a way that you crouched
down behind it and a passing animal or what

278
00:16:47,437 --> 00:16:52,175
have you say, a truant officer or whatever
can't tell the reflection from the real

279
00:16:52,175 --> 00:16:54,378
thing. So it just looks like there's nothing
there.

280
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:58,849
And I said I couldn't believe that that
looked even as close as I was, that we'll

281
00:16:58,882 --> 00:17:00,751
just look like normal grass and so on and
everything.

282
00:17:01,118 --> 00:17:04,321
And and of course, I knew Bill is just just
behind the mirror.

283
00:17:04,354 --> 00:17:05,889
It's just a fantastic, you know?

284
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:15,332
But I know he's not in the mirror when I say
to check this, I don't know where bill with

285
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:17,334
Bell,

286
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,469
Bell, Bell.

287
00:17:21,204 --> 00:17:21,905
Now there he is.

288
00:17:32,382 --> 00:17:35,051
Well, there's been some interesting changes
of events here.

289
00:17:35,318 --> 00:17:40,257
The bird watchers club is officially changed
its charter to become the Wine Spinners Club,

290
00:17:40,423 --> 00:17:44,995
which was it was funny the first two or
three hundred times, but then it kind of wore

291
00:17:44,995 --> 00:17:48,999
a little thin and and by then the coach was
so drenched with wine you could pass out just

292
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:51,368
from the fumes. The guys may go back to
birdwatching.

293
00:17:52,335 --> 00:17:55,405
Excuse me, I'll go ahead. But did you hear
how Doc Render is going to raise the money?

294
00:17:55,405 --> 00:17:56,673
There's $300 and he needs.

295
00:17:56,706 --> 00:17:58,141
He's having a lottery.

296
00:17:58,275 --> 00:18:00,310
Oh, tickets are a buck each.

297
00:18:00,343 --> 00:18:03,780
I bought ten and first prize is a quarter of
a million dollars.

298
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,383
That's a lot of money. The only video games
I can buy with that.

299
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:11,054
Oh hell, I don't like to sound negative, but
that sounds like a major crock to me.

300
00:18:11,888 --> 00:18:13,356
I don't happen to think so.

301
00:18:13,757 --> 00:18:15,959
They'll be drawing the winning ticket
tonight at the Lodge meeting.

302
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:17,794
Oh, and I feel lucky.

303
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:19,429
You don't look like a hero.

304
00:18:21,631 --> 00:18:24,868
Hey, that's it. That's the sound of the
possum the meeting's coming to order.

305
00:18:25,535 --> 00:18:29,839
Just think of it, Uncle Red. Soon I can go
from being a normal average guy just to being

306
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:31,675
a quarter of a millionaire.

307
00:18:34,244 --> 00:18:36,546
I'm guessing he'll still be a quarter of an
average guy.

308
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,984
I don't know if Doc can pull this thing off,
but if he does, I think we should give him a

309
00:18:40,984 --> 00:18:41,851
national deficit.

310
00:18:43,987 --> 00:18:45,455
Great. Great. Great.

311
00:18:47,757 --> 00:18:48,058
Yeah.

312
00:18:51,628 --> 00:18:55,932
I wouldn't doubt that 12 kind of things
going.

313
00:18:57,233 --> 00:18:58,535
All right.

314
00:18:58,868 --> 00:19:00,537
All right, that's not. All right.

315
00:19:01,004 --> 00:19:03,273
Seriously. Okay, all right.

316
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:05,041
We start the meeting. We're starting the
meeting.

317
00:19:05,275 --> 00:19:10,013
Bird people want

318
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:16,853
A lot more time to act right now.

319
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,555
Not really. Come on.

320
00:19:19,622 --> 00:19:20,490
Really, don't even

321
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,127
Shut down the Wine Tasting Council meeting.

322
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,662
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

323
00:19:28,264 --> 00:19:29,999
Oh, boy.

324
00:19:31,568 --> 00:19:32,902
Well, that was good. That was good.

325
00:19:33,036 --> 00:19:35,038
That was OK. That was a good one.

326
00:19:35,405 --> 00:19:38,007
That was a good one. But the other one was
shot up there on the floor.

327
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,275
Recognize the doc. Render.

328
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,176
Thank you, Richard.

329
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,311
Thank you. Thank you, fellas.

330
00:19:41,945 --> 00:19:45,782
Now would what anybody else like to buy a
lottery ticket on?

331
00:19:47,383 --> 00:19:49,886
Your chances of winning are one in one
hundred and fifty.

332
00:19:49,886 --> 00:19:51,087
I never win anything.

333
00:19:51,087 --> 00:19:52,155
I bought 10.

334
00:19:54,157 --> 00:19:55,224
What anybody else want to buy?

335
00:19:55,391 --> 00:19:56,726
Just anybody else? Take one.

336
00:19:56,893 --> 00:19:57,961
Save your money, Dwayne.

337
00:19:57,961 --> 00:20:01,030
It's a scam scam, scam scam.

338
00:20:01,397 --> 00:20:02,966
It is not a scam.

339
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:07,170
All right. Now read Why don't you go ahead
and grow the lucky number?

340
00:20:07,603 --> 00:20:10,673
All right. They can drop you down there.

341
00:20:10,807 --> 00:20:12,008
Keep it in the family, Uncle Fred.

342
00:20:14,077 --> 00:20:16,112
All right. Here's our lucky winner.

343
00:20:16,212 --> 00:20:18,448
Listen up. Number one.

344
00:20:18,448 --> 00:20:21,417
Oh, two. Just want to make

345
00:20:22,018 --> 00:20:22,885
Sure that's fair.

346
00:20:30,226 --> 00:20:32,962
This is so great. I'm going to buy like my
own show.

347
00:20:32,995 --> 00:20:34,130
I don't even need to buy this anymore.

348
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:38,801
I got my own show. I'm going to buy like a
house on a hill and a boat with a CD player

349
00:20:38,801 --> 00:20:43,639
and a jeep. A read one to read.

350
00:20:44,073 --> 00:20:46,075
Take this job and shove it.

351
00:20:48,644 --> 00:20:50,346
I don't want to. I don't do well now.

352
00:20:50,346 --> 00:20:59,622
Here you go here. Look at the site
blackjack.

353
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,226
That's huge. Look at this one dollar.

354
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,130
What one dollar was offered.

355
00:21:08,097 --> 00:21:10,800
That's one dollar. I suppose I'm supposed to
be a quarter of a millionaire.

356
00:21:11,367 --> 00:21:15,037
That's that's like two hundred and forty
nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine short

357
00:21:15,037 --> 00:21:16,572
doc. Oh, no, no, no, no.

358
00:21:16,606 --> 00:21:21,077
Harold Harold first prize in the lottery was
a dollar a month for a quarter a million

359
00:21:21,077 --> 00:21:24,881
months. Oh, what's that?

360
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:26,682
Oh, do you read the fine print there?

361
00:21:26,716 --> 00:21:28,217
No, well, it's there.

362
00:21:28,217 --> 00:21:29,518
Well, that is brilliant.

363
00:21:29,552 --> 00:21:32,121
Good for you, Doc.. Wait, how come we didn't
think of that?

364
00:21:32,321 --> 00:21:33,522
So I'm not like rich.

365
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,558
No, you're not Harold. You're not a
millionaire.

366
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:40,096
You're a dollar heir and one who's just
shoved this job.

367
00:21:40,162 --> 00:21:43,733
I got. We're here.

368
00:21:45,468 --> 00:21:49,805
There you go. There's one hundred and sixty
bucks, just over half of what I owe you.

369
00:21:49,972 --> 00:21:53,542
Great. Dwayne saw the fish locate in half
and give it to him, but come on.

370
00:21:54,076 --> 00:21:56,879
Well, read my lips doc, I said Three hundred
dollars.

371
00:21:58,047 --> 00:22:00,816
Oh, wait. I'm going to get down there.

372
00:22:00,883 --> 00:22:03,185
You're wine tasters. Why don't you go back
to birdwatching?

373
00:22:03,285 --> 00:22:07,123
Huh? Ok. Really?

374
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,293
Not unless maybe you combine the two.

375
00:22:11,327 --> 00:22:15,865
What you do is you guys buy the other half
of this locator when doc here is not fishing,

376
00:22:15,865 --> 00:22:19,735
huh? You can strap the locator to the roof
of the lodge and use it to spot bird.

377
00:22:23,706 --> 00:22:28,711
You guys up. So the guy with

378
00:22:28,711 --> 00:22:29,912
50 drunken friends.

379
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,581
Thanks, fellas. Yeah.

380
00:22:32,882 --> 00:22:36,786
All right, if there's if there's no other
large business, forget it.

381
00:22:37,853 --> 00:22:38,254
Come on,

382
00:22:38,721 --> 00:22:40,055
Give us an evening's entertainment.

383
00:22:40,089 --> 00:22:41,757
Hey, bro.

384
00:22:42,858 --> 00:22:43,959
So now what's the matter?

385
00:22:45,861 --> 00:22:50,533
Well, Bill, possums, Romans, countrymen, lend
me your ears.

386
00:22:54,670 --> 00:23:00,176
I know that we're not holding elections for
the leadership of the Lodge, but consider

387
00:23:00,176 --> 00:23:09,351
this if elected, I promise to put a chicken
in every pot hot pot.

388
00:23:10,286 --> 00:23:13,556
Well, I guess that's the first time we've
ever had a happy ending for this show.

389
00:23:13,923 --> 00:23:16,325
And it's not actually like the happy ending
as other shows.

390
00:23:16,325 --> 00:23:19,161
You know where everybody learns something
and they have a hug.

391
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:22,364
Speaking with you? My wife is watching me.

392
00:23:22,398 --> 00:23:25,834
I'll be coming straight home after the
meeting and and I actually have learned

393
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:27,636
something and I got just the hug to prove
it.

394
00:23:29,338 --> 00:23:33,375
Until next time on behalf of myself and
Harold and the whole gang up here at Possum

395
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:35,077
Lodge, if we stick on the ice.

396
00:23:39,748 --> 00:23:43,786
If I am elected, I promise to get my mom to
drive you guys everywhere.

397
00:23:43,953 --> 00:23:45,754
You really good. She's got a neat car.

398
00:23:45,955 --> 00:23:51,593
You know, I also promise to hold my breath
every two years starting making election

399
00:23:51,593 --> 00:23:53,862
promises. We have an election here.
