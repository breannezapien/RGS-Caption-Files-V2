SHAKING THE GROUND

IT WAS A KID IN A CHEVETTE

WITHOUT HAVING A LEAF
OF SALAD YET,

TO YOU AND SAYS,

00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,540
HEY, ARE YOU
HAVING MORE MEAT?
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

74

FOR THE JUGULAR.

I'M ALSO HAVING
VEGETABLES.

I MEAN, HORSERADISH IS
A VEGETABLE, RIGHT, RED?

84
00:03:57,803 --> 00:04:00,039
SURE IS.
SO IS GRAVY,

FORGET SALT.

SHE'S STILL ON YOUR CASE,

LOOK AT HER AND
GIVE HER THIS FACE.

90
00:04:16,188 --> 00:04:19,358

ALL RIGHT, LET'S START WITH
SOMETHING FOR THE LADIES,

104
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:57,730
LIKE DOING YOUR NAILS,
FOR EXAMPLE.

105
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,465
GET YOURSELF A
PIZZA BOX LIKE THIS

106
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,700
AND TRACE YOUR
HAND ON THERE

107
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,170
AND THEN PUNCH OUT ALL THE
FINGERNAIL TIPS THERE,

108
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,073
AND THEN ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
-- A REAL GREAT TIME SAVER,

109
00:05:08,073 --> 00:05:10,843
IS YOU JUST PUT YOUR
HAND INSIDE THE BOX,

110
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:14,280
TAKE SOME SPRAY PAINT THERE
AND JUST PUT THAT ALL ON THERE.

111
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,949
IT DOESN'T MATTER,
YOU KNOW, HOW YOU DO IT.

112
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:19,251
I HOPE THE OTHER LODGE MEMBERS
STILL RESPECT ME WITH,

113
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:21,387
YOU KNOW,
PAINTED FINGERNAILS.

114
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,322
ALL RIGHT.

115
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:29,528
OH, WE HAVE TO HAVE THE BACK
OF YOUR HAND AGAINST THE HOLE.

116
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:32,264
THIS ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE
I'VE BEEN ARRESTED AND
FINGERPRINTED.

117
00:05:32,264 --> 00:05:34,633

NOW FOR SURE.

118

YOU CAN USE FOR

FITTING INTO THAT DRESS THAT
YOU BOUGHT LAST FALL,

125
00:05:55,954 --> 00:05:57,623
YOU DON'T NEED A GIRDLE,

126
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:00,859
GET YOURSELF ONE OF THESE
TUBE SOCKS AND CUT THE
TOE OUT OF THAT

AND JUST SLIP THAT
BABY ON THERE.

WILL GET ALL KINDS

THERE WE GO.

132
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:22,614
AND I'LL TELL YOU,
YOU'RE NOT JUST LOOKING GOOD,
YOU'RE LOSING WEIGHT

133
00:06:22,614 --> 00:06:24,616
BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY
YOU CAN EAT FOOD

134
00:06:24,616 --> 00:06:26,885
WHEN YOU'RE WEARING
THIS TYPE OF A UNIT.

135
00:06:26,885 --> 00:06:28,387
AND ANOTHER THING IS
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE

136
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:31,790
YOUR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
IS TIGHT AS A DRUM.

137
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,193
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
WHAT ABOUT THE MEN?

138
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:36,295
WHAT CAN THEY DO TO GET
THEMSELVES KIND OF GUSSIED UP

139
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,497
FOR A FANCY OCCASION?

140
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:41,667
WELL, BASICALLY THEY SHAVE
AND GET A HAIRCUT.

141
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,468
I DON'T EVEN DO THAT.
I DON'T SHAVE MYSELF.

142
00:06:43,468 --> 00:06:45,504
BUT WHEN I HAVE TO GO
SOMEWHERE AND LOOK REAL GOOD

143
00:06:45,504 --> 00:06:47,306
LIKE AT A FUNERAL OF
SOMEBODY WITH MONEY,

144
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:52,144
WHAT I'LL DO IS COVER UP MY
BEARD WITH THESE FLESH
COLOURED BANDAGES,

145
00:06:54,546 --> 00:06:57,983
AND I JUST
CAMOUFLAGE THE BEARD.

146
00:06:57,983 --> 00:07:00,385
MAN, I LOOK
LIKE JAY LENO.

147
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:03,422
AS FAR AS THE HAIRCUT GOES,
YOU KNOW THE REASON THAT A
BARBER CAN CHARGE YOU

148
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,357
UP TO SEVEN BUCKS
TO CUT YOUR HAIR IS BECAUSE

149
00:07:05,357 --> 00:07:08,527
HE'S LEARNED HOW TO CUT EVERY
HAIR EXACTLY THE SAME LENGTH.

150
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:10,595
BUT THERE'S A CHEAP WAY
THAT YOU CAN DO THAT AT HOME

151
00:07:10,595 --> 00:07:13,165
EVEN IF YOUR HEAD
ISN'T BOWL SHAPED.

152
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:14,933
OKAY, FIRST THING YOU NEED
IS AN OLD LAMP,

153
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:16,735
TAKE THE
CORD OFF OF IT,

154
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:22,941
AND THEN GET RID OF THE LAMP
SO YOUR WIFE DOESN'T ASK
ANY STUPID QUESTIONS.

155
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:25,344
AND THEN YOU WANT TO TAKE
ONE OF THEM LIGHT DIMMERS

156
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:27,212
AND HOOK THAT INTO
THE MIDDLE OF THE CORD

157
00:07:27,212 --> 00:07:29,181
AND HOOK THAT ALL UP, AND I'LL
SHOW YOU HOW THAT WORKS.

158
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:31,683
[ ELECTRICITY ZAPPING ]

159
00:07:31,683 --> 00:07:34,352
ALL RIGHT, ONCE YOU GOT
THAT HOOKED UP,

160
00:07:34,352 --> 00:07:37,656
PLUG HER IN AND THEN ATTACH

161
00:07:37,656 --> 00:07:40,525
THE BARE ENDS OF THE WIRES
TO YOUR EARLOBES.

162
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:42,661
NOW WHEN I TURN ON
THE DIMMER HERE,

163
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:44,463
THE ELECTRICITY FLOWS INTO
THE HEAD OF THE VICTIM --

164
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:46,031
I SHOULD SAY THE CUSTOMER,

165
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:47,966
MAKING HIS HAIR STAND
RIGHT UP ON END,

166
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:49,935
MAKING IT REAL
EASY TO CUT.

167
00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:52,971
YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH
A FELLOW WHO'S NOT ONLY
HANDSOME, BUT HANDY.

168
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:54,739
WATCH THIS.

169
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:59,478
NOT QUITE WHAT
I HAD IN MIND,

170
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:01,880
BUT HE'S NOT GOING TO NEED A
HAIRCUT FOR A WHILE.

171
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,448
Red: STAY TUNED.

172
00:08:03,448 --> 00:08:05,984
COMING UP, BILL HAS ANOTHER
NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE
WITH GRAVITY,

173
00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:08,820
AND THEN BUZZ SHOWS HAROLD
WHAT IT'S LIKE AT BOOT CAMP.

174
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,893
I WANT TO TALK TO ALL
YOU MIDDLE-AGED GUYS

175
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:16,328
ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL
TIRED ALL THE TIME.

176
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:17,829
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH.

177
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:20,932
MANY IS A TIME I SIT IN THE
LIVING ROOM THERE LISTENING
TO MY WIFE TALK,

178
00:08:20,932 --> 00:08:23,768
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN MY LEG
WILL FALL ASLEEP,

179
00:08:23,768 --> 00:08:25,937
OR I'LL BE GOING UP
A FLIGHT OF STAIRS

180
00:08:25,937 --> 00:08:27,606
AND HAVE TO PULL OVER
INTO THE SLOW LANE

181
00:08:27,606 --> 00:08:29,608
TO LET THE DOG GO BY,

182
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:31,643
AND HE'S 17,

183
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:35,714
WHICH IN DOG YEARS IS...
OLD MAN SEDGEWICK.

184
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:37,782
IT JUST SEEMS THAT
AS THE YEARS PILE UP,

185
00:08:37,782 --> 00:08:39,150
THE ENERGY LEVEL
GOES DOWN.

186
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,219
NOW, YOUR DOCTOR IS GOING
TO TELL YOU IT'S THE
HOURS YOU KEEP

187
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:44,656
OR THE FOOD YOU EAT OR HOW
MUCH OF IT OR NOT GETTING
ENOUGH EXERCISE,

188
00:08:44,656 --> 00:08:46,591
PLUS THE FACT THAT YOU'VE
PUT ON 75 POUNDS

189
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,827
SINCE THE LAST TIME
YOU DID ANYTHING,

190
00:08:48,827 --> 00:08:50,629
BUT I SAY IT'S
ALL IN YOUR MIND.

191
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:53,064
SEE, YOUR MIND HAS JUST SAT
THERE QUIETLY FOR 40 YEARS,

192
00:08:53,064 --> 00:08:55,500
WATCHING YOUR
BODY DO STUFF LIKE...

193
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,869
FLIP OVER THE HANDLEBARS
OF YOUR BIKE;

194
00:08:57,869 --> 00:09:01,106
OR TAKE THE FAST WAY
DOWN FROM THE ROOF;

195
00:09:01,106 --> 00:09:05,744
OR GO [ snap ] FROM PICKING UP
TOO MUCH WALL BOARD.

196
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:09,014
AND YOUR MIND IS TIRED OF
TAKING IN ALL THAT PAIN.

197
00:09:09,014 --> 00:09:11,216
SO ONE DAY WHEN YOUR
BRAIN IS ASLEEP,

198
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:14,452
LIKE WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING
RERUNS OF "MATLOCK"
OR SOMETHING,

199
00:09:14,452 --> 00:09:17,455
YOUR MIND QUIETLY TELLS YOUR
MUSCLES TO GO TO SLEEP

200
00:09:17,455 --> 00:09:19,090
OR CRAMP UP OR SOMETHING.

201
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:23,395
AND THAT EXHAUSTION IS
JUST SELF-PRESERVATION,
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

202
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:25,363
YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY
THAT YOUR BODY IS TOO TIRED

203
00:09:25,363 --> 00:09:27,165
TO DO THE THINGS
THAT YOU WANT TO DO

204
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:29,567
BECAUSE THAT TIREDNESS
IS SAVING YOUR LIFE.

205
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:31,569
REMEMBER,
I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

206
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:34,439
WE'RE ALL
IN THIS TOGETHER.

207
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:38,376
WELL, THIS GROUP PHOTOGRAPH
WE'RE PLANNING TO TAKE

208
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:40,779
IS TURNING INTO A
PORTRAIT OF DISASTER.

209
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:43,681
SOMETIMES I THINK THE
RESIDENTS AROUND HERE ARE
ONE CHROMOSOME AWAY

210
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:46,317
FROM DRAGGING THEIR
KNUCKLES ON THE GROUND.

211
00:09:46,317 --> 00:09:48,353
HOW HARD CAN IT BE TO TELL
THEM TO SHOW UP ON TIME

212
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:49,721
AND JUST STAND IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE STREET?

213
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:52,123
EXACTLY, ALL THEY GOTTA
DO IS STAND THERE AND
STARE AT THE SKY.

214
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:54,359
THEY DO IT
FOR AN ECLIPSE.

215
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:56,394
SOME OF THE GUYS ARE SAYING,
BRING THE PLANE IN LOW

216
00:09:56,394 --> 00:09:58,062
SO YOU CAN'T
SEE MY BALD SPOT,

217
00:09:58,062 --> 00:09:59,864
AND OTHERS WANT US
TO DELAY IT FOR A MONTH

218
00:09:59,864 --> 00:10:02,534
SO THEY CAN GO ON A DIET,
FOR GOSH SAKES.

219
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:04,435
THE PLANE IS GOING TO BE
1,000 FEET UP,

220
00:10:04,435 --> 00:10:06,070
NO ONE IS EVEN
GOING TO NOTICE.

221
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,072
WHAT A BUNCH
OF VAIN IDIOTS.

222
00:10:08,072 --> 00:10:10,308
SAYS THE GUY WHO SPENT
TEN BUCKS ON ACNE CREAM.

223
00:10:10,308 --> 00:10:12,377
I HAD A FLARE-UP!

224
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:16,848
SO I JUST TOLD THE FAT ONES
TO STAND UNDER THE GROCERY
STORE AWNING.

225
00:10:16,848 --> 00:10:18,850
THE GROCERY STORE
HAS GOT A NEW AWNING?
WELL, YEAH.

226
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,019
SEE, THE MERCHANTS REALIZE
THEIR SHOPS ARE GOING TO
BE IN THE PICTURE,

227
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:23,555
SO NOW THEY'RE FIXING
THEIR STORES UP.
OH GREAT.

228
00:10:23,555 --> 00:10:26,090
WELL, IT WAS UNTIL THEY
SAW THE ADVERTISING
POTENTIAL.

229
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:28,226
NOW THE FUNERAL PARLOUR PUT
A GREAT BIG SIGN ON THE ROOF,

230
00:10:28,226 --> 00:10:30,595
COFFINS,
PRICED TO MOVE.

231
00:10:30,595 --> 00:10:31,896
OH BOY.

232
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:34,098
THE WORST WAS MURRAY'S
LEISURE WEAR...

233
00:10:34,098 --> 00:10:38,536
10-FOOT LETTERS: MEN'S AND
LADIES' PANTS HALF-OFF.

234
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:40,939
WELL, WHAT WITH PICTURE
DAY COMING UP,

235
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:42,941
I THOUGHT WE'D DROP IN
AND SEE OUR RESIDENT

236
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:45,643
BUSH PILOT/AERIAL
PHOTOGRAPHER BUZZ SHERWOOD.

237
00:10:45,643 --> 00:10:48,713
HEY, BUZZ.
YO, RED MAN,
HOW ARE YOU?

238
00:10:48,713 --> 00:10:50,515
GOOD. GOOD. GOOD.
GOOD TO SEE YOU, EH?

239
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:52,116
HAROLD!

240
00:10:55,386 --> 00:10:57,221
OH, FOR CRYING
OUT LOUD, HAROLD,

241
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:59,357
HOW MUCH CAN THAT HURT?

242
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:03,194
I WAS ASKING HAROLD.

243
00:11:03,194 --> 00:11:05,697
SO, BUZZ, YOU ALL SET FOR
THE PICTURE TAKING THING?

244
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:07,031
OH, SURE, SURE.

245
00:11:07,031 --> 00:11:09,467
AS SOON AS WE PASS
OUR SAFETY INSPECTION,
WE'RE IN BUSINESS.

246
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:11,035
WHAT SAFETY INSPECTION?

247
00:11:11,035 --> 00:11:13,504
OH MAN,
THE RULE MAKERS.

248
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:15,506
THE WHOLE CORRUPT
SYSTEM, MAN,

249
00:11:15,506 --> 00:11:17,408
THEY JUST WANT TO TIE
MY FEET TO THE GROUND.

250
00:11:17,408 --> 00:11:19,444
YOU KNOW, THEY PULL THESE
RANDOM CHECKS, RIGHT,

251
00:11:19,444 --> 00:11:22,780
SO THAT GUYS LIKE ME
MAKE SURE OUR PLANES
ARE SAFE.

252
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,348
SAFE?
I MEAN,
WHAT IS SAFE?

253
00:11:24,348 --> 00:11:29,020
IT'S LIKE, ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO PREDICT WHAT'S GOING
TO FALL OFF OR NOT?

254
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,056
SEE!
SHEESH.

255
00:11:32,056 --> 00:11:34,025
WELL, IF THEY
FIND SOMETHING --
WHAT AM I SAYING?

256
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:36,627
WHEN THEY FIND SOMETHING
WRONG WITH THE PLANE,
WHAT HAPPENS THEN?

257
00:11:36,627 --> 00:11:41,999
OH, MAN, THE FLIGHT FUZZ
COME DOWN ON YOU
SO HARD, MAN!

258
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:43,868
WELL, THEN, WHO ARE
WE GOING TO GET

259
00:11:43,868 --> 00:11:45,269
TO FLY OVER POSSUM LAKE
AND TAKE OUR PICTURE?

260
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:47,438
OH, DON'T -- DON'T PANIC.
DON'T PANIC.

261
00:11:47,438 --> 00:11:48,940
HEY, YOUR BUDDY BUZZ
HAS EVERYTHING UNDER
CONTROL,

262
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,476
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN
WORKING ON BEAUTY HERE.

263
00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:52,944
SHE'S GOING TO
PASS NO PROBLEM.

264
00:11:52,944 --> 00:11:55,480
I EVEN CAULKED UP ALL
THEM BULLET HOLES.

265
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,815
WELL, YOU MISSED A WHOLE
BUNCH RIGHT THERE IN
THE TAIL SECTION.

266
00:11:57,815 --> 00:11:59,317
OH, THOSE ONES.
THAT'S OKAY.

267
00:11:59,317 --> 00:12:00,852
THOSE ARE GOING
IN HOLES.

268
00:12:00,852 --> 00:12:02,920
I CAN SAY THAT WAS LIKE
A HUNTING ACCIDENT
OR SOMETHING.

269
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,423
IT'S THE EXIT HOLES
THAT MAKE THEM NERVOUS.

270
00:12:05,423 --> 00:12:07,458
AND LOOK, LOOK WHAT I FOUND,
LOOK WHAT I FOUND, HUH?

271
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,327
TWO MORE BOLTS TO
HOLD THE PROPELLER ON.

272
00:12:09,327 --> 00:12:11,629
NOW I GOT FOUR OUT
OF FIVE THERE.

273
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:14,498
AND THESE THINGS,
DID YOU KNOW THESE
WERE CALLED FLAPS,

274
00:12:14,498 --> 00:12:17,501
AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO OIL THEM?

275
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:19,870
I MEAN, I JUST
LEARNED SO MUCH.

276
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,273
THE CONTROL PANEL,
I PUT A BATTERY
BEHIND IT, RIGHT,

277
00:12:22,273 --> 00:12:24,542
AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE IT
REALLY WORKS WITH LIGHTS
AND EVERYTHING.

278
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:25,943
IT'S JUST AMAZING.

279
00:12:25,943 --> 00:12:27,511
SO YOU THINK BEAUTY IS
GOING PASS THIS THING?

280
00:12:27,511 --> 00:12:28,913
OH, NO PROBLEM.

281
00:12:28,913 --> 00:12:31,048
I PUMPED OUT THE PONTOONS
AND DUCT TAPED THE HOLES.

282
00:12:31,048 --> 00:12:32,383
THIS IS GOING
TO BE GREAT.

283
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,819
AND THAT WILL FOOL
THE INSPECTORS?
NO SWEAT.

284
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:36,387
WHAT IF THEY ASK
YOU TO FLY HER?

285
00:12:36,387 --> 00:12:38,456
OH, WELL,
THEY NEVER DO,

286
00:12:38,456 --> 00:12:41,225
BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN THEY
WOULD HAVE TO GET IN IT
AND GO UP WITH ME.

287
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:46,697
UNCLE RED, UNCLE RED,

288
00:12:46,697 --> 00:12:48,766
WHAT'S THIS DEFICIENCY
IN ADULTS

289
00:12:48,766 --> 00:12:50,634
THAT MAKES THEM WANT
TO DRINK ALCOHOL?

290
00:12:50,634 --> 00:12:52,436
WELL, THERE'S NO
DEFICIENCY, HAROLD.

291
00:12:52,436 --> 00:12:54,305
IT'S A TRADITION,
A RITUAL.

292
00:12:54,305 --> 00:12:56,307
ALCOHOL IS A
SIGN OF FRIENDSHIP,

293
00:12:56,307 --> 00:12:58,509
YOU KNOW, LIKE BAPTISM

294
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:02,380
OR INSTALLING A NEW POPE
OR A PLAYOFF GAME.

295
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,382
WELL, PERSONALLY,
YOU KNOW,

296
00:13:04,382 --> 00:13:06,517
I JUST DON'T THINK
IT'S NECESSARY.

297
00:13:06,517 --> 00:13:08,686
FOR INSTANCE, LIKE,
HOW COME THEY NEED
LIKE ALCOHOL

298
00:13:08,686 --> 00:13:11,021
AT LIKE A WEDDING?
HOW COME?

299
00:13:11,021 --> 00:13:12,456
WELL, HAROLD,
WITHOUT ALCOHOL

300
00:13:12,456 --> 00:13:14,492
A LOT OF WEDDINGS
WOULD NEVER HAPPEN.

301
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:16,594
IT'S UP TO EACH PERSON
TO KNOW HIS OWN LIMIT,

302
00:13:16,594 --> 00:13:19,663
YOU KNOW, IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL
THAT MAKES THE DECISION,
THAT'S ALL.

303
00:13:19,663 --> 00:13:21,499
WELL, I THINK THAT A LOT
OF THE LODGE MEMBERS

304
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:24,735
ARE MAKING BAD DECISIONS,
EVERY WEEKEND.

305
00:13:24,735 --> 00:13:26,804
WELL, HAROLD, EITHER
THEY'VE GOT A DISEASE

306
00:13:26,804 --> 00:13:28,339
THAT NEEDS TO BE
LOOKED AFTER

307
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:31,442
OR MAYBE THEY'RE TRYING
TO ESCAPE AN UNPLEASANT
SITUATION.

308
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:34,145
I NEVER THOUGHT OF THE
LODGE AS AN UNPLEASANT
SITUATION.

309
00:13:34,145 --> 00:13:36,847
ONLY WHEN YOU'RE
HERE, HAROLD.

310
00:13:36,847 --> 00:13:39,884
WELL, DON'T YOU WORRY,
I'M GOING BACK HOME
IN A FEW MONTHS.

311
00:13:41,318 --> 00:13:43,020
WANT TO GIVE US A
PUSH THERE, HAROLD,

312
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,856
THE BEER STORE
CLOSES IN AN HOUR.

313
00:13:47,658 --> 00:13:49,827
Red: TIME FOR
ADVENTURES WITH BILL.

314
00:13:49,827 --> 00:13:53,063
I'D BEEN READING THE MAIL,
SO I WAS OUT FLYING A KITE,

315
00:13:53,063 --> 00:13:53,764
OF COURSE.

316
00:13:53,764 --> 00:13:55,599
AND BILL DECIDED
TO JOIN ME.

317
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:56,867
ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL?

318
00:13:56,867 --> 00:13:59,737
JUST SUCH A SIMPLE THING UP
THERE, FLYING AWAY,

319
00:13:59,737 --> 00:14:01,038
IT'S KIND OF MAGICAL.

320
00:14:01,038 --> 00:14:03,574
AND BILL IS GOING TO WHIP
OUT A KITE KIT.

321
00:14:03,574 --> 00:14:04,842
YEAH, THESE ARE GREAT.

322
00:14:04,842 --> 00:14:07,678
GOT THE CHILD PROOF LOCK BAG,
WHICH IS SENSIBLE.

323
00:14:07,678 --> 00:14:10,414
YOU DON'T WANT A KID
OPENING UP ONE OF THOSE

324
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:11,782
AND PLAYING WITH A KITE.

325
00:14:11,782 --> 00:14:14,885
LUCKILY BILL HAS A VASECTOMY
KIT IN HIS OTHER POCKET.

326
00:14:14,885 --> 00:14:16,487
OH WELL,
THANK YOU, BILL.

327
00:14:16,487 --> 00:14:18,522
YEAH, OH-OH IS RIGHT.
NOW WHAT?

328
00:14:18,522 --> 00:14:21,458
YOU GOT ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE
KITS IN YOUR KIT THERE?

329
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:24,595
WELL, THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH,
HE'S GOING TO GIVE ME HIS.

330
00:14:24,595 --> 00:14:26,530
OH, NO, HE HAS
GOT ANOTHER ONE.

331
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,565
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

332
00:14:28,565 --> 00:14:30,200
FAIR ENOUGH.
FAIR ENOUGH.

333
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,438
SO NOW WITH THESE, YOU KNOW,
YOU GOT A LITTLE BIT OF
ASSEMBLY REQUIRED.

334
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:37,141
AND OF COURSE WE CAN PUT
THESE TOGETHER FASTER

335
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:39,677
THAN MOST WOMEN CAN
READ THE INSTRUCTIONS.

336
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:42,613
BILL'S IS KIND OF A WILD
LOOKING THING, ISN'T IT?

337
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:43,714
MINE IS -- OH BILL.

338
00:14:43,714 --> 00:14:46,517
NOW, THAT'S ODD, THE WILD
LOOKING THING IS --

339
00:14:46,517 --> 00:14:47,618
WOW. UNBELIEVABLE.

340
00:14:47,618 --> 00:14:50,521
BUT, YOU KNOW, TO ME THE
THING ABOUT WILD KITES IS

341
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:52,856
THEY SHOULDN'T REALLY
BE IN CAPTIVITY.

342
00:14:52,856 --> 00:14:55,059
THERE YOU GO, BE FREE.
GO BE FREE.

343
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:56,193
FAIR IS FAIR, BILL.

344
00:14:56,193 --> 00:14:58,462
SO WE DECIDED
TO COMBINE OUR EFFORTS

345
00:14:58,462 --> 00:15:01,965
AND MAKE A SUPER, DUPER, TRIPLE,
TRIPLE DECKER THREE STOREY --

346
00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:03,967
YEAH, IT'S A BEAUTY.
IT'S A BEAUTY.

347
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:06,937
IT'S A BEAUTY.
IT'S A BEAUTY.
IT'S A BEAUTY.

348
00:15:06,937 --> 00:15:08,806
ALL RIGHT, BILL,
THROW 'ER UP.

349
00:15:08,806 --> 00:15:10,607
THROW 'ER UP.
THROW 'ER UP.

350
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:12,176
LET 'ER GO.
LET 'ER GO.

351
00:15:12,176 --> 00:15:14,545
OH BOY.
THROW 'ER UP.
THROW 'ER UP.

352
00:15:14,545 --> 00:15:17,147
LET 'ER GO.
LET 'ER GO.
FOR GOSH SAKE.

353
00:15:17,147 --> 00:15:20,684
ALL RIGHT, BILL, BILL,
I'LL TAKE CARE OF
THAT ONE, OKAY?

354
00:15:20,684 --> 00:15:23,120
NOW, HERE IS A KITE KIT.
LOOK AT ALL THIS.

355
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,956
LOOK AT THIS.
LOOK AT THIS.
LOOK AT THIS.

356
00:15:25,956 --> 00:15:26,857
LOOK AT THIS.

357
00:15:26,857 --> 00:15:27,658
HUH, WHAT?

358
00:15:27,658 --> 00:15:29,760
A LITTLE BIT OF
OVERPACKAGING THERE.

359
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,263
OH, I SEE, THE KIT IS ACTUALLY
THE BOX THAT IT COMES IN.

360
00:15:33,263 --> 00:15:34,631
WELL, NOW, THAT'S SMART.

361
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:37,067
BOY, THIS IS A BEAUTY.
THIS IS A BEAUTY.

362
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:39,937
THIS THING -- THIS THING IS
REALLY GOING TO FLY.

363
00:15:39,937 --> 00:15:41,104
IT'S GOING TO FLY.

364
00:15:41,104 --> 00:15:43,440
DO YOU THINK THAT STRING
IS HEAVY ENOUGH?

365
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,642
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

366
00:15:45,642 --> 00:15:48,212
OKAY, BILL, THROW 'ER UP.
THROW 'ER UP.

367
00:15:48,212 --> 00:15:49,179
THERE SHE GOES.

368
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:51,548
OH, MAN, LOOK AT HER GO.
LOOK AT HER GO.

369
00:15:51,548 --> 00:15:54,017
LOOK OUT, BILL,
IT'S COMING BACK... BILL.

370
00:15:54,017 --> 00:15:55,619
FAIR ENOUGH.
HE'S FINE.

371
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:58,155
OH, OH, UP SHE GOES,
BIG WIND, BIG WIND.

372
00:15:58,155 --> 00:16:02,025
THERE SHE GOES.

373
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:03,493
AND THAT'S A 107-FOOT BILL.

374
00:16:03,493 --> 00:16:05,762
AND NOW IT'S,
OH, A 100-FOOT BILL,

375
00:16:05,762 --> 00:16:06,663
90, 80, 70, 60.

376
00:16:06,663 --> 00:16:08,999
OKAY, THAT'S A
SEA LEVEL BILL THERE.

377
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:10,033
IS HE ALL RIGHT?

378
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:11,401
CHECKING OVER THE KITE.

379
00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:12,469
OH THERE HE GOES.

380
00:16:12,469 --> 00:16:13,170
HE'S OKAY.

381
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:18,108
WE'LL CHECK
HIS TAIL LATER.

382
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:23,447
Red: COMING UP,
WE GOT WINSTON ROTHSCHILD,

383
00:16:23,447 --> 00:16:24,781
THE ULTIMATE HOSER,

384
00:16:24,781 --> 00:16:26,817
AND HAROLD IS
GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW
HE COLOURED HIS PLACEMAT

385
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:28,652
FROM THE
POSSUM LODGE DINER.

386
00:16:30,454 --> 00:16:32,255
WELL, FOR A WHILE
THERE IT LOOKED LIKE

387
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,057
THAT BIG GROUP AERIAL
PHOTO THING WAS GOING
TO BE CANCELLED.

388
00:16:34,057 --> 00:16:36,593
WE GOT THE DATE AND
THE TIME ALL NAILED
DOWN AND EVERYTHING,

389
00:16:36,593 --> 00:16:38,628
BUT WE GOT FAMILIES
FEUDING WITH OTHER FAMILIES,

390
00:16:38,628 --> 00:16:40,998
AND THEY REFUSED TO POSE
IN THE SAME PICTURE.

391
00:16:40,998 --> 00:16:43,734
I GOT THAT COVERED, UNCLE RED.
I HAVE GOT THAT COVERED.

392
00:16:43,734 --> 00:16:45,402
I'VE COLOUR CODED
THE DOWNTOWN AREA.

393
00:16:45,402 --> 00:16:47,771
LOOK AT THIS, I PUT
THE POTTSONS RIGHT HERE

394
00:16:47,771 --> 00:16:49,339
BECAUSE THEY DON'T
WANT TO BE NEAR THE
RICHARDSONS,

395
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:51,341
WHO I PLACED STRATEGICALLY
OVER HERE, YOU SEE?

396
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:53,543
NOW, THEY'RE IN FRONT
OF THE SIMMS UP HERE

397
00:16:53,543 --> 00:16:55,479
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY,
THEY HATE THE TYLERS.

398
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:56,913
RIGHT THERE,
THAT'S THE TYLERS.

399
00:16:56,913 --> 00:16:58,315
BUT THAT'S OKAY,
THAT'S GOING TO BE OKAY,

400
00:16:58,315 --> 00:17:00,150
BECAUSE WHAT I'VE DONE IS
I PUT US, THE GREEN FAMILY,

401
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,053
RIGHT IN THE CENTRE OF TOWN,
RIGHT THERE AT THE CROSSWALK.

402
00:17:03,053 --> 00:17:06,757
AND THE FREDERICKS --
KNOW WHAT I'VE DONE
WITH THE FREDERICKS?

403
00:17:06,757 --> 00:17:08,325
PUT THEM RIGHT THERE
AS A DEFENCE.
ASK ME WHY.

404
00:17:08,325 --> 00:17:10,327
DON'T, BECAUSE
I'LL TELL YOU.

405
00:17:10,327 --> 00:17:12,896
BECAUSE WHAT I'VE
DONE IS I'M PROTECTING
THE SIMMS FROM THE TYLERS

406
00:17:12,896 --> 00:17:14,531
BECAUSE IF THEY TRY TO
SNEAK UP HERE,

407
00:17:14,531 --> 00:17:16,466
YOU KNOW, ON THE FLANK
OF THE SIMMS, CAN'T HAPPEN

408
00:17:16,466 --> 00:17:18,268
BECAUSE OF THOSE FREDERICKS
DEFENCE PEOPLE.

409
00:17:18,268 --> 00:17:19,436
WHAT ABOUT THE
RICHARDSONS, YOU ASK?

410
00:17:19,436 --> 00:17:21,104
I TELL YOU.
THEY'RE RIGHT HERE.

411
00:17:21,104 --> 00:17:22,706
AND IF THEY TRY THE OLD
QUARTERBACK SNEAK PLAY,

412
00:17:22,706 --> 00:17:24,274
WHAT WE DO IS WE
REVERSE OUR OFFENSIVE,

413
00:17:24,274 --> 00:17:26,143
WE MEET DOWN HERE
AT THE MAILBOX

414
00:17:26,143 --> 00:17:29,446
RIGHT DOWNTOWN RIGHT THERE.

415
00:17:29,446 --> 00:17:34,618
[ APPLAUSE ]

416
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:41,191
YOU CAN JUST
FEEL THE LOVE IN THE
COMMUNITY, CAN'T YOU?

417
00:17:41,191 --> 00:17:43,860
A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND
POSSUM LAKE THINK THIS
GROUP PHOTO THING

418
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,662
IS A TOTAL WASTE
OF TIME AND MONEY.

419
00:17:45,662 --> 00:17:47,464
SO I THOUGHT WE'D TALK
TO WINSTON ROTHSCHILD HERE

420
00:17:47,464 --> 00:17:50,166
TO GET SOME OF
THE ENTREPRENEURIAL
ANGLES ON THE PROJECT.

421
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,602
WELL, YOU KNOW, I GOT A
SUGGESTION JUST OFF THE
TOP OF MY HEAD, EH,

422
00:17:52,602 --> 00:17:55,038
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
THE PHOTO, LAMINATE IT

423
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:57,407
AND MAKE PLACEMATS
OUT OF IT,

424
00:17:57,407 --> 00:17:59,209
YOU KNOW,
LIKE FOR TABLES.

425
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:00,944
I DON'T KNOW,
WINSTON.

426
00:18:00,944 --> 00:18:02,545
I THINK AN AERIAL SHOT OF
POSSUM LAKE

427
00:18:02,545 --> 00:18:03,914
IS GOING TO MAKE
IT HARD ON DIGESTION.

428
00:18:03,914 --> 00:18:05,615
AND MAYBE TOUGH TO CLEAN.

429
00:18:05,615 --> 00:18:07,917
HOW DO YOU TELL THE
LAKE FROM THE STAIN?

430
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:10,186
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT
MY BUSINESS GURU

431
00:18:10,186 --> 00:18:13,056
AND SUCCESS MENTOR
ANTHONY ANTHONY
SAYS, EH?

432
00:18:13,056 --> 00:18:15,325
YOU GOT TO SEIZE EVERY
OPPORTUNITY, YOU KNOW,

433
00:18:15,325 --> 00:18:17,160
AND INCREASE BUSINESS.

434
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,795
WELL, ALL RIGHT,
FINE, WELL, TELL EVERYBODY

435
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:20,630
HOW YOU'RE GOING TO USE
THE TOWN PHOTO OPPORTUNITY

436
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,232
TO INCREASE
YOUR BUSINESS THEN.

437
00:18:22,232 --> 00:18:24,701
WELL, LIKE A LOT OF
FOLKS OWES ME MONEY,
RIGHT?

438
00:18:24,701 --> 00:18:26,603
DINGER LOMBIE
OWES ME 50 BUCKS

439
00:18:26,603 --> 00:18:28,338
FROM A JOB I DONE
FOR HIM LAST SPRING,

440
00:18:28,338 --> 00:18:31,908
AND WELL THE KEELYS
STILL HAVEN'T PAID UP
FROM LAST MONTH.

441
00:18:31,908 --> 00:18:34,811
OH, AND THERE'S THIS BIG
JOB FOR THE ST. GERMANES
THAT I DONE.

442
00:18:34,811 --> 00:18:38,448
I RESCUED A REAL
EXPENSIVE PIECE OF
JEWELLERY FOR THEM.

443
00:18:38,448 --> 00:18:39,916
I MEAN, HOW HUNGOVER
DO YOU HAVE TO BE

444
