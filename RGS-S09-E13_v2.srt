1
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,006
IS PERFECTING THEIR SWING.

2
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:07,007
MY ADVICE...

3
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:09,242
DO AWAY WITH THE
SWING ALL TOGETHER

4
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:13,146
WITH THE RED GREEN HOLE-IN-ONE,
SWINGLESS GOLF CLUB.

5
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:17,751
ALL YOU DO IS ATTACH THE HEAD
OF YOUR DRIVER AND A REAL
HEAVY DUTY FISHING REEL,

6
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,886
AND TO ONE OF THESE CHEST
EXPANDER UNITS

7
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,688
PERHAPS YOU GAVE TO
A CLOSE PERSONAL FRIEND,

8
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:24,958
ONLY TO HAVE HER THROW THE WHOLE
THING RIGHT BACK IN YOUR FACE.

9
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:27,093
THEN ALL YOU DO IS RUN SOME
100-POUND TEST LINE

10
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,896
FROM THE REEL RIGHT DOWN
TO THE HEAD OF THE CLUB.

11
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,631
AND YOU'RE READY TO PLAY.

12
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:38,738
THE MORE YOU REEL IT IN,
THE MORE POWER IT DELIVERS.

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,207
JUST WIND HER IN, 'TIL YOU
GET IT WHERE YOU WANT IT,

14
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,410
THEN LOCK IT.

15
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:45,345
THEN WHEN YOU'RE READY,

16
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,047
LET 'ER RIP.

17
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:54,054
[cheering and applause]

18
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,202
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

19
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,270
APPRECIATE IT.

20
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:11,738
THE LOCAL BANK'S GOT A
BIG DEAL GOING ON.

21
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,073
YOU OPEN UP AN ACCOUNT,

22
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:15,275
AND THEY GIVE YOU ONE THESE
WEATHER RADIOS FOR FREE!

23
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:16,443
NO CHARGE. THERE'S NO CHARGE.

24
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:17,777
IT'S FREE AND THEY JUST GIVE
IT TO YOU.

25
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,679
I MEAN, THERE'S NO CHARGE.
I MEAN --

26
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:21,448
THIS IS CRAZY, EH?

27
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:24,250
NO WONDER THE BANKS
AREN'T DOIN' WELL.

28
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:28,021
RED, IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
IN FOR SOME PRETTY
SERIOUS WEATHER.

29
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,823
YOU BEEN LISTENING TO
YOUR WEATHER RADIO?

30
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,124
NO.

31
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,592
WELL, YOU KNOW,
YOU SHOULD

32
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:33,993
BECAUSE WE
GOT TROUBLE!

33
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,361
LET ME TELL HIM.
THAT'S RIGHT, RED.

34
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,963
WE GOT A
CYCLONE COMING.

35
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,164
NO, IT'S A HURRICANE.

36
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,100
YEAH, RIGHT,
A HURRICANE.

37
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,734
RIGHT, IT'S A BIG
WIND, AND IT'S, LIKE,

38
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,636
3,000-MILE-PER-HOUR WINDS!

39
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,305
150-KILOMETRE-AN-HOUR.

40
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,507
RIGHT, WITH HAIL STONES
THE SIZE OF GOLF BALLS!

41
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,742
NO, NO HAILSTORM.
JUST HIGH WIND,
LOTTA RAIN.

42
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,711
AND WE GOT A
TORNADO COMIN'!
NO, IT'S A HURRICANE.

43
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,246
IT'S A BIG STORM!

44
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:58,818
OKAY --
NO.

45
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:01,421
DALTON, WE DON'T
GET HURRICANES HERE.

46
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,256
WE'RE TOO FAR
FROM THE OCEAN.

47
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,491
WE GET A FAIR
BIT OF WIND,

48
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,259
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE WE'RE
SO CLOSE TO PORT ASBESTOS,

49
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,161
AND IT SUCKS.

50
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,864
NOT THIS TIME, RED.
WE'VE GOT A FORCE 5 HURRICANE.

51
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,133
HURRICANE DOUG
IS COMING OUR WAY!

52
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,268
WE GOTTA HUNKER DOWN.
WE GOTTA BOARD UP THE WINDOWS.

53
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:18,505
RATION THE WATER!
SAVE ONE BULLET
FOR YOURSELF!

54
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,814
IT'S TIME FOR
THE POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

55
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,321
AND TODAY Mr ED FRID

56
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:37,157
IS PLAYING FOR
THIS SPECIAL COUPON,

57
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:41,094
WHICH ALLOWS HIM TO GET 50% OFF
ON ALL OTHER COUPONS.

58
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:46,199
Mr GREEN, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS TO
GET Mr FRID TO SAY THIS WORD...

59
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,704
ALL RIGHT, MIKE.

60
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,339
OH, OKAY.
AND, GO!

61
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,074
OKAY, ED,

62
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:56,609
YOU TAKE SOMETHING WILD,
AND YOU FEED IT,

63
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,244
AND YOU LOOK AFTER IT,
AND YOU GET TO THE POINT

64
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,113
WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT IF IT'S GOING TO
ATTACK YOU ANYMORE.

65
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:01,681
THAT WILD ANIMAL IS NOW...

66
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,917
YOUR TEEN-AGED SON.

67
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,518
NO, NO, NO, NO.

68
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:08,588
WHEN THE WILD ANIMAL HAS
BEEN TRAINED TO BE WITH
PEOPLE, IT'S...

69
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,791
JUST WAITING FOR ITS
CHANCE TO ATTACK.

70
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,161
NO, THIS ANIMAL IS NOT
DANGEROUS BECAUSE IT'S...

71
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,796
DEAD.

72
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,766
OKAY, THINK ABOUT AN ANIMAL.

73
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:22,135
YOU WANT A WORD THAT
RHYMES WITH GAME.

74
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,703
MAIM.

75
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:26,973
ALMOST OUTTA TIME, Mr GREEN.

76
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,841
ED, I'M TALKING ABOUT,
LIKE, A PET FOR A KID,

77
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:31,010
A CUDDLY PUPPY
OR A HAMSTER --
WHOA, NO.

78
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,779
NO, DON'T GET A HAMSTER.
THEY'RE EVIL.

79
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,514
OH, YEAH.

80
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,082
YEAH, THEY'LL COME INTO YOUR
ROOM WHILE YOU'RE SLEEPING

81
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,651
AND EAT YOUR EYES.

82
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,687
OH, YEAH, YOU CAN'T
TAME A HAMSTER.

83
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:42,555
THERE WE GO!

84
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,724
[applause]

85
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,832
[Harold cawing]

86
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,240
UNCLE RED.
OH, YOU'RE
BREATHING HEAVY.

87
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:03,509
THIS BUILDING WAS DESIGNED
BY A MORON, HAROLD.

88
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,745
THE ELEVATOR ONLY GOES
TO THE 19th FLOOR.

89
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:08,548
HA HA! YOU GOT ON
THE WRONG ELEVATOR.

90
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,084
SOME OF THEM ONLY GO
TO THE 19th FLOOR.

91
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,952
THE OTHERS GO
FROM 20 ON UP.

92
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:16,155
WELL, I STILL SAY THERE'S A
MORON INVOLVED SOMEWHERE
IN THIS SITUATION.

93
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,358
WELL, I WON'T ARGUE
WITH YOU ON THAT.

94
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,226
PARDON ME, HAROLD?
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME
WATER FOR THAT?

95
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,695
WE HAVE DISTILLED,
SPARKLING, REVERSE OSMOSIS.

96
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,397
I PREFER FAUCET.

97
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,266
REVERSE FAUCET,
IF YOU HAVE IT.

98
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:27,800
PERFECT.

99
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,836
JUST GONNA USE
THE PHONE HERE.

100
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,039
HELLO?

101
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:36,276
[Red's voice on intercom]
hello!

102
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,511
PIECE OF CRAP!

103
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,448
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

104
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,817
WELL, I'M TRYING TO
USE THE PHONE, HAROLD.

105
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,886
IT WAS INVENTED
130 YEARS AGO.

106
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,188
I THOUGHT THEY'D
HAVE IT WORKING BY NOW.

107
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,691
WELL, LINE SIX IS THE DIRECT
LINE TO OUR NEW YORK OFFICE.

108
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,393
OH.
YEAH, SEVEN AND EIGHT'S
OUR TOLL FREE NUMBER;

109
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,495
ELEVEN AND TWELVE IS
OUR I.S.D.N. NUMBER
FOR DATA TRANSFER;

110
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:56,896
AND IF YOU WANT
AN OUTSIDE LINE,

111
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,232
THAT'S ONE THROUGH FIVE;
YOU HAVE TO DIAL NINE
TO GET OUT.

112
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:00,967
DO YOU HEAR YOURSELF, HAROLD?

113
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,402
I JUST WANNA
MAKE A PHONE CALL.

114
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,805
YOU'RE RECITING FOUR PAGES
OUT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE
SERVICE MANUAL.

115
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,874
WHAT'S GOING ON,
HAROLD?

116
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,609
IS IT ME?

117
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:13,012
WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
IN THE BIG CITY NOW.

118
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,614
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE
TO EMBRACE TECHNOLOGY.

119
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,349
YOU DON'T DO
THAT VERY MUCH.

120
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,117
I EMBRACE AUNT BERNICE.

121
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:20,653
THAT BEATS REVERSE OSMOSIS,
I'LL TELL YOU.

122
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,789
I'LL TRUST YOU
ON THAT ONE.

123
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,624
BUT YOU KNOW,
HERE WHERE I WORK,

124
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,025
WE HAVE TO
EMBRACE TECHNOLOGY

125
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,894
'CAUSE IF WE DON'T,
TECHNOLOGY WILL
PASS US BY.

126
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,629
YEAH, BUT WHAT
ABOUT LIFE, HAROLD, HUH?

127
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,764
WHAT ABOUT LIFE PASSING YOU BY?

128
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:36,402
WHAT ABOUT THE THRILL OF
MAKING SOMETHING WITH
YOUR OWN HANDS?

129
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,271
WHERE DOES THAT FIT
INTO YOUR WORLD?

130
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,073
REMEMBER THAT
FISHING BOAT I MADE,

131
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,508
USING ALL THOSE HEATING DUCTS
AND THE RECLINER,

132
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,110
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

133
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,579
HOW WOULD YOUR DOWNTOWN BUDDIES
PULL THAT ONE OFF, HUH?

134
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,015
THEY'D BUY A BOAT.

135
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,217
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
I'M SAYING.

136
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:51,651
EXACTLY.

137
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,919
EXACTLY.

138
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:02,695
EXACTLY.

139
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,797
OKAY, WE GOT OUR NEXT TWO ITEMS
UP FOR AUCTION HERE.

140
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,033
MIKE, WHY DON'T
YOU START US OFF?

141
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,368
UH, OKAY.

142
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:09,802
THANK YOU, Mr GREEN.

143
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,704
AS YOU CAN SEE, GENTLEMEN,

144
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:15,508
UH, THIS IS AN AUTHENTIC
DRIVE-IN MOVIE SPEAKER

145
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:18,978
THAT DATES ALL THE WAY
BACK TO THE '50s.

146
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,680
WHERE'D YOU
GET THAT, MIKE?

147
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,982
AT THE POSSUM LAKE
DRIVE-IN THEATRE.

148
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,420
YOU GOT THAT IN
THE '50s?

149
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,756
NO, I GOT IT ON
SATURDAY NIGHT.

150
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:32,225
UH, BUT IT IS OLD,
YEAH.

151
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,494
AND THERE WAS A MOVIE FROM THE
'50s PLAYING AT THE TIME,

152
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,763
UH, THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. 

153
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:42,435
I GUESS YOU LEFT BEFORE THEY GOT
TO "THOU SHALT NOT STEAL."

154
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,073
LOOK, I KNOW WE ALL KID
ABOUT MY CRIMINAL RECORD,

155
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:49,642
BUT, Mr GREEN, I'M ACTUALLY
A LITTLE HURT.

156
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:51,878
I DID NOT STEAL
THIS SPEAKER.

157
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,312
I JUST HAD TO LEAVE
IN A HURRY,

158
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,782
AND I FORGOT THAT IT WAS
STILL STUCK IN THE WINDOW.

159
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,183
HONEST.

160
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,684
WHAT WAS THE
BIG RUSH?

161
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:01,821
WELL, THE CAR'S OWNER CAME
BACK FROM THE SNACK BAR.

162
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:05,691
ALL RIGHT, WELL, WE'LL GET
TO THAT ITEM IN A MINUTE.

163
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,794
NOW LET'S SEE WHAT
HAP BROUGHT FOR US.

164
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,362
THANK YOU, RED.

165
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:12,565
I FIGURE WHAT THIS
AUCTION NEEDS IS A
TOUCH OF CELEBRITY.

166
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,368
SO I BROUGHT
ALONG SOMETHING JUST
A LITTLE BIT SPECIAL.

167
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,703
OH, MAN!
THAT'S A DAZZLER.

168
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,505
THAT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING
ELVIS WOULD WEAR, HUH?

169
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,542
IN HIS DREAMS,
MAYBE.

170
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,710
NO, I MEAN, WHO WAS
THE CELEBRITY?

171
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:25,077
I WAS.

172
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,180
HUH?

173
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,655
I WORE IT TO
FRONT MY BAND

174
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,256
IN THE LATE '50s,

175
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,492
HAP HORNET AND
THE ROCKIN' DRONES.

176
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,428
OH, YEAH, WE HAD
OUR OWN SOUND.

177
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,697
I'M GUESSIN'
PUGET SOUND.

178
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,133
NO, NO, NO.
WE WERE VERY BIG.

179
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,701
WE HAD A GOLD RECORD IN '58,

180
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,237
"GOTTA LOTTA HOTTA WATTA"
(got a lot of hot water).

181
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,073
WE TOURED ALL OVER THE STATES.

182
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,808
DID YOU EVER
MEET THE KING?

183
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:56,943
WHO'S THAT?

184
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,444
ELVIS?
ELVIS.

185
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,745
ELVIS, NAH.

186
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,781
WELL, I MET HIM,
BUT WE HARDLY SPOKE.

187
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:04,217
HE OPENED FOR ME IN FRESNO.

188
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,387
I WOULD'VE BEEN THE KING MYSELF,
BUT I WAS CANADIAN,

189
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:11,023
SO THEY CALLED ME THE PRIME
MINISTER OF ROCK AND ROLL.

190
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,359
[applause]

191
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,331
SO THIS WAS
YOUR JACKET?

192
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,967
YEAH, FANS WOULD GO
NUTS WHEN THEY SAW
ME IN THAT.

193
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,736
I REMEMBER TELLING ANN-MARGRET
I WAS TOO BUSY TO SEE HER.

194
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,005
BROKE HER HEART.

195
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:29,642
TO CHEER HER UP, I SUGGESTED SHE
GO AND SHOW ELVIS THE ROPES.

196
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,577
I DIDN'T MEAN LITERALLY.

197
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:33,646
BOY, HAP,
I DUNNO.

198
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,114
YOU AS A ROCK STAR?

199
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,482
I'M HAVING TROUBLE
BELIEVING THIS.

200
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,117
WHAT DO YOU THINK, MIKE?

201
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,087
WELL, I THINK YOU SHOULD
SHOW A LITTLE MORE
RESPECT, Mr GREEN.

202
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,822
OH,
THANKS, MIKE.

203
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,423
TAKE IT FROM ME.

204
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:47,894
YOU CAN'T TOSS OFF A
WHOPPER LIKE THAT AND
KEEP A STRAIGHT FACE, MAN.

205
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,695
THAT'S REALLY HARD.

206
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:52,265
LOOK, I DON'T CARE WHETHER
YOU GUYS BELIEVE ME OR NOT.

207
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,966
I'M TELLIN' YOU,
I WAS A ROCK STAR.

208
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,103
WHY ELSE WOULD A HETEROSEXUAL
GUY WEAR A THING LIKE THAT?

209
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,507
SO HOW'S IT
GOING, DALE?

210
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,643
I'M ALL DONE
HERE, Mr GREEN.

211
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,444
DO YOU STILL HAVE
THE WASHROOM KEY?

212
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,013
NO, I GAVE IT BACK
TO YOU, DIDN'T I?

213
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,414
I DON'T THINK SO.

214
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,583
OH, NO,
THERE IT IS.

215
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,818
WOW, I WAS AFRAID
I'D LOST IT AGAIN.

216
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:16,756
I, UH, PUT A DROP OF OIL
IN YOUR HORN RELAY.

217
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:19,225
YOUR HORN WAS STICKING.

218
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,060
YEAH, I KNOW.
I LIKE IT STICKING.

219
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,729
THAT WAY I CAN LET MORONS
KNOW WHAT I THINK OF THEM

220
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,132
AND STILL KEEP BOTH
HANDS ON THE WHEEL.

221
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,334
YOUR GENERATION IS SO
CONFRONTATIONAL.

222
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,002
NO, WE'RE NOT!

223
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,873
WELL, I MEAN, DOESN'T
YOUR GENERATION EVER LEAN
ON THE HORN ONCE IN A WHILE?

224
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,909
NO, MOSTLY I JUST
USE IT TO SAY HI;

225
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,779
YOU KNOW, BEEP BEEP,
HOW'S IT GOIN', BUDDY?

226
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:42,181
DALE, A HORN IS NOT
FOR SAYING HELLO.

227
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,350
IT'S FOR SAYING, GET THE
HELL OUTTA THE WAY.

228
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,551
LIKE THIS...

229
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:48,688
[honking horn]

230
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,223
YOU'RE HOLDING IT FOR
TWO WHOLE NOTES, Mr GREEN.

231
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,459
SEE, IF YOU JUST PLAY
TWO QUARTER NOTES,

232
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,428
[honking horn]

233
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:56,862
IT SOUNDS CHEERFUL.

234
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,965
YOU SHOULD TRY IT.
IT'LL BE COOL.

235
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,033
OH, WELL, I DEFINITELY
WANNA BE COOL.

236
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,202
THAT'S A TOP
PRIORITY WITH ME.

237
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:05,471
WELL, GIVE IT
A TRY, Mr GREEN.

238
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:08,007
YOU NEVER KNOW.
YOU MIGHT SURPRISE YOURSELF.

239
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,742
YEAH, WHY DON'T I
JUST DO THAT, DALE?

240
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,745
AND YOU HAVE YOURSELF
A RAINBOW DAY.

241
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,183
[honking horn]

242
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:18,918
YOU KNOW SOMETIMES
YOU GO INTO TOWN,

243
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,252
YOU GOT A LIST
OF THINGS TO DO...

244
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,021
MAYBE, PICK UP SOME
GROCERIES FOR THE FAMILY;

245
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,322
GO TO THE POST OFFICE.

246
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,091
AND THE BAD PART IS WHEN
YOU GET THE GROCERIES FIRST,

247
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:29,695
THEY GOTTA SIT IN THE VAN WHILE
YOU'RE WAITING FOR SERVICE
AT THE POST OFFICE.

248
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,897
ESPECIALLY IF YOU GOT ICE CREAM.

249
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,737
AND DON'T THINK YOUR CAN TRICK
YOUR KIDS BY REFREEZING
ICE CREAM.

250
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,839
BELIEVE ME,
SOMETHING CHANGES.

251
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,143
SO TODAY WE'RE GONNA TURN A VAN

252
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,479
INTO A MOBILE
REFRIGERATION UNIT.

253
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:49,415
SO YOU'LL NEVER BE IN A RUSH
TO GET HOME WITH THOSE
DARNED GROCERIES.

254
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:50,983
AND THE BEAUTY OF
THIS PROJECT IS

255
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,552
YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT REFRIGERATION.

256
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,254
WE'RE NOT REINVENTING
THE WHEEL HERE.

257
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,957
WE'RE JUST STEALING
FRIDGE TECHNOLOGY.

258
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,359
SO ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS GET THE DOOR OFF OF

259
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,461
JUST AN ORDINARY KITCHEN
REFRIGERATOR LIKE THIS ONE.

260
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,130
THAT SHOULD BE NO PROBLEM.

261
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,898
I BELIEVE IT'S JUST
A LIFT AND TUG THING.

262
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,739
MAYBE THIS ONE'S MORE OF
A YANK AND SWING DEAL.

263
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:23,115
NO, NO, I THINK THIS IS ACTUALLY
THE HYPEREXTEND MECHANISM
ON THIS ONE.

264
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:30,923
NOPE.

265
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,637
ALL RIGHT, ONCE YOU'VE GOT
THE DOOR OFF THE FRIDGE,

266
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,906
WHAT YOU GOTTA DO IS MAKE AN
OPENING IN THE SIDE OF THE VAN

267
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,642
BIG ENOUGH FOR THE BACK OF
THE FRIDGE TO STICK OUT OF.

268
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:51,644
AND IF YOU'RE A REAL HANDYMAN
AND YOU GOT A GOOD EYE,

269
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,579
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO MEASURE.

270
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,061
ALL RIGHT, NOW, I'VE ATTACHED
THE FRIDGE ON THERE,

271
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,696
AS YOU CAN SEE, WITH THE
HANDYMAN'S SECRET WEAPON,

272
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,864
DUCT TAPE.

273
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,332
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M THINKING?

274
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,834
THIS VAN ISN'T REALLY AIRTIGHT.

275
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,635
I NEED A LITTLE
EXTRA COOLING POWER.

276
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:19,138
SO I ADDED A COUPLE OF FRIDGES
ONTO THE BACK HERE.

277
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,639
ACTUALLY, MOOSE THOMPSON
GAVE ME THE FRIDGES.

278
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,975
HE ACTUALLY USED TO HAVE ONE IN
EVERY ROOM IN HIS HOUSE,

279
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,611
BUT NOW HE'S UPGRADED TO A
WALK-IN MEAT LOCKER.

280
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,447
OH, AND WATCH THE LIGHT GO ON
WHEN I OPEN THE DOOR.

281
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,350
SEE, JUST LIKE A FRIDGE.

282
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,086
OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
ONE OTHER THING I
WANNA SHOW YOU.

283
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:37,923
I'VE WIRED ALL THE FRIDGES UP TO
THIS CIGARETTE ADAPTER HERE.

284
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,925
I ACTUALLY DID THAT MYSELF.

285
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,829
OH, YEAH, I KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT
ELECTRONICS AS I DO ABOUT
REFRIGERATION.

286
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,365
ALL RIGHT, TIME TO
PICK UP THE GROCERIES

287
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:49,335
AND DO THE ICE CREAM TEST.

288
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,218
TALK ABOUT AIR CONDITIONING.

289
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,620
I'D SAY, IF ANYTHING,

290
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,923
THE ICE CREAM ACTUALLY
GOT HARDER THIS TIME.

291
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,692
SO REMEMBER IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

292
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,362
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

293
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,301
THAT'S PROBABLY
GONNA HURT LATER.

294
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,211
I WANNA TALK TO YOU
OLDER MARRIED GUYS

295
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,547
ABOUT SOMETHING THEY
DON'T TEACH YOU IN SCHOOL.

296
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,916
THERE'S A LOT OF TALK THESE
DAYS ABOUT STANDING UP
FOR YOUR RIGHTS

297
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,218
AND SPEAKING UP FOR YOURSELF.

298
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:42,721
THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO ANY
SUCCESSFUL MARRIAGE.

299
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,559
ANY IDIOT KNOWS WHEN TO SPEAK UP
AND SHOOT HIS MOUTH OFF,

300
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:50,062
BUT A REAL WISE MAN KNOWS WHEN
TO JUST PUT A LID ON IT.

301
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,532
OH, YEAH, THERE ARE CERTAIN
TIMES IN ANY MARRIAGE

302
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,168
WHEN IT'S BETTER
TO JUST SAY NOTHING;

303
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,505
FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN YOU
DO SOMETHING WRONG,

304
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,542
YOU BREAK SOMETHING,
OR YOU LOSE SOMETHING,

305
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:06,712
OR YOU FORGET SOMETHING,
OR YOU DRINK SOMETHING.

306
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,082
JUST KEEP VERY, VERY QUIET.

307
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,418
I KNOW HONESTY
IS A GREAT POLICY,

308
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:15,321
SO IS INSURANCE.

309
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:19,758
THE TRICK IS NOT USE EITHER ONE
UNTIL YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.

310
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,694
YOU KNOW, LIFE HAS A WAY OF
GETTING YOU INTO TROUBLE.

311
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,662
YOU DON'T NEED TO HELP IT.

312
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,031
SO WHEN YOU SCREW UP,
SHUT UP.

313
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,235
ANOTHER TIME
YOU WANNA KEEP QUIET

314
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:31,637
IS WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING RIGHT;

315
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,739
LIKE, YOUR WAY WAS
THE RIGHT WAY,

316
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,875
AND YOUR IDEA
WAS THE RIGHT IDEA,

317
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,710
YOUR PLAN WAS THE RIGHT PLAN.

318
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:40,379
NO ONE THAT YOU'RE MARRIED TO
WANTS TO HEAR THAT.

319
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,216
NOTHING GOOD EVER
FOLLOWS THE PHRASE,

320
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,118
I TOLD YOU SO.

321
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,721
SO WHENEVER YOU
DO SOMETHING WRONG,

322
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,656
OR WHENEVER YOU
DO SOMETHING RIGHT,

323
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,359
TRY JUST KEEPING YOUR TRAP SHUT.

324
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,561
AND IF IT WORKS,
WELL, I --

325
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,964
REMEMBER I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

326
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,299
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

327
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,038
[sound of hammering]

328
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,573
OW!

329
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,608
OH, GEEZ.

330
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:13,479
UH, OKAY, GIRLS.

331
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,015
GOT THE WINDOWS
ALL BOARDED UP.

332
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,249
ARE YOU GONNA BE OKAY,

333
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,951
OR DO YOU WANT A
TEDDY BEAR TO HUG?

334
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,719
YOU BETTER
TAKE COVER, RED.

335
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,322
THEY'RE EXPECTING
HURRICANE DOUG TO HIT
OUR AREA ANY SECOND!

336
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,057
OH, BOY, A HURRICANE.

337
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,425
GOSH, WHERE AM
I GONNA HIDE?

338
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,060
OH, BOY.
OH, BOY.

339
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,995
OH, THERE'S
GONNA BE RAIN.

340
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,864
THERE'S GONNA BE WIND.

341
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,466
OH, BOY.
I GUESS I'LL WARN THE OTHERS.

342
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,801
BETTER WARN THE OTHERS.

343
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,570
LOOK OUT, EVERYBODY.

344
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,439
OH, LOOK OUT.
LOOK OUT.

345
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:41,974
[birds chirping ]

346
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,543
BOY, IT'S VERY, VERY
SUNNY OUT HERE.

347
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:46,045
BIRDS -- LITTLE BIRDIES,

348
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,880
THERE'S A HURRICANE COMING.

349
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,315
HURRICANE.

350
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,983
OH, LOOK, THERE'S
A PLACE I CAN HIDE.

351
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,285
I'LL GO SIT
IN THE CANOE.

352
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:59,258
[clock ticking]

353
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:03,429
KIDS JUST LIKE
TO GET INVOLVED IN
SOMETHING WITH YOU, YOU KNOW,

354
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:07,199
JUST A SIMPLE BACKYARD GAME OR
AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION.

355
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:11,870
AND THAT IS THE TYPE OF THING
THAT WON'T COST YOU
ANYTHING BUT TIME.

356
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:16,942
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO OUT
AND BUY A WHOLE BUNCH OF
EXPENSIVE SPORTS EQUIPMENT

357
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,411
OR VIDEO GAMES
OR ALL THAT STUFF.

358
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,247
BUT HERE'S THE THING,
DON'T BE SELFISH ABOUT IT.

359
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,315
JUST A SECOND.

360
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,550
DON'T BE SELFISH.

361
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,985
DON'T JUST DO THINGS
THAT YOU WANNA DO.

362
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,586
YOU SEE YOU HAVE TO BE --
JUST A SECOND.

363
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,089
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE
TO READ A KID.

364
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,624
AND SUGGEST THINGS YOU
FIGURE HE'D LIKE TO DO.

365
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,259
THAT'S WHAT YOU
WANNA BE ABLE TO DO.

366
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:38,664
WHOA! YOU SNUCK RIGHT UP
ON ME THERE, DIDN'T YOU?

367
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,966
YOU'RE GETTING PRETTY GOOD
AT THIS GAME, HUH?

368
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,535
OKAY, WELL, I'LL DO
THE COUNTING NOW,

369
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,204
AND YOU RUN
ALONG AND HIDE.

370
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,740
YOU RUN OFF AND HIDE,
AND I'LL DO THE COUNTING.

371
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,908
I'M NOT LOOKING.
DON'T WORRY, I'M COUNTING.

372
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,677
I'M NOT LOOKING HERE AT ALL.

373
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:56,048
YOU KNOW, I NEVER USED TO PLAY
HIDE AND SEEK WHEN I WAS A KID.

374
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,117
OH, NO, NO, I HAD THE FRIENDS.
NO, I DID.

375
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,652
BUT WE'D ALWAYS GET TOGETHER AT
THE PARENTS' HOUSE, YOU KNOW,

376
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:04,056
AND THERE WAS NEVER
ANY PLACE TO HIDE.

377
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:08,093
DAD HAD PRETTY MUCH BLOWN
EVERYTHING FLAT, YOU KNOW.

378
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,996
HAD TO GO A MILE TO FIND
A DOOR TO HIDE BEHIND.

379
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:14,566
OR JUST DIG A HOLE IN THE
GROUND AND LIE DOWN IN IT.

380
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,803
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT,
I LIKE HIDE AND SEEK.

381
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:20,706
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
HAVE TO RUN.

382
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,941
YOU JUST TAKE YOUR TIME.

383
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:25,677
YOU'RE LOOKING AROUND CASUALLY.

384
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:28,480
IT'S NOT LIKE TAG.

385
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,017
GOD, I HATE TAG.

386
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:37,022
[applause]

387
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,059
[bell ringing]

388
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,728
Red:
WALTER AND I ARE OUT IN THE 
BACK BEHIND THE LODGE THERE, 

389
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,029
JUST PAINTING THE SHED. 

390
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,898
THAT'S A GOOD WAY 
TO SPEND A SATURDAY -- 

391
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:48,534
OR EVEN BETTER, 
LIKE, A WEDNESDAY. 

392
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,503
WALTER'S JUST YOUNGER. 
HE'S GOT NO PATIENCE.
 

393
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,005
IT'S NOT DRY YET, WALTER. 
IT'S NOT DRY.
 

394
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:54,973
IT'S NOT DRY! 
WE JUST PAINTED IT.
 

395
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,442
NO, DON'T BLOW ON IT. 

396
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,277
THAT'S NOT GONNA HELP. 
THAT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE.
 

397
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,878
THAT'S GONNA MAKE 
YOU LOOK FOOLISH.
 

398
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:02,848
IT'S NOT DRY. 
JUST RELAX.
 

399
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,750
TAKE IT EASY. 
THE SUN'LL DRY IT. 

400
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:06,251
THE BREEZE WILL -- 

401
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:07,419
NO, NOT -- 
YOU GONNA FAN -- 

402
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,488
HE'S GONNA FAN -- 
OKAY, WALTER, OKAY.
 

403
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:13,892
IF YOU WANNA USE A FAN, 
USE A FAN.
 

404
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,061
ONE OF THE GREAT 
THINGS ABOUT THE LODGE,
 

405
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,131
WE GOT SO MUCH EQUIPMENT 
LYING AROUND THAT HASN'T 
BEEN FOUND YET. 

406
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,933
LOOK AT THIS, EH? 

407
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,302
NOW, THIS BABY WAS A LITTLE 
HEAVIER THAN WHAT I --
 
 

408
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:25,437
ALSO WAS BOLTED THE GROUND. 

409
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:30,075
YEAH, YOU GO AHEAD, WALTER, 
AND I'LL BE ALONG IN A MINUTE
 

410
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,048
WE GOT HER ON THE LAWN MOWER. 

411
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,716
SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA TO ME 

412
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:40,352
NOW WE'LL JUST CRANK -- 
THIS BABY'S GOT ABOUT
 
700 HORSE, I THINK.

413
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,155
LOOK AT HER JUST -- 
WHOA! WAIT A MINUTE.
 

414
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,590
COME ON BACK. 
COME ON BACK.
 

415
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:46,658
NO, NO, UP AGAINST THE SHED - 

416
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:47,893
OH, THE PEPPER MILL. 

417
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,194
UH-OH, UH-OH. 

418
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,963
OH, BOY. 
OH, BOY.
 
 

419
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,665
OKAY, OH, BOY. 

420
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,000
HERE'S TWO OF THE DWARVES, 

421
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,803
SNEEZY AND DOPEY. 

422
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,139
OH, BOY. 

423
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,341
OH, AND IT'S KILLING 
THE PAINT JOB. 

424
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,510
ALL RIGHT, WALTER YOU TRY -- 

425
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:07,045
WHY DID THEY PUT THE ON/OFF 
SWITCH ON THE FRONT OF THE FAN
 

426
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,347
I MEAN, HOW DO YOU -- 

427
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,915
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. 

428
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,617
I'LL TRY AND KILL 
THE MAIN SWITCH;
 

429
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,718
YOU WORK TOWARDS IT, WALTER. 

430
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,219
ATTABOY. 
LEAN INTO IT.
 

431
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,487
LEAN INTO IT. 

432
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,823
THERE YOU GO. 
LEAN INTO HER THERE. 

433
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,424
IS THAT THE BREAKER? 

434
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,726
NO, NO. 

435
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,427
NO, SHE'S STILL GOING. 

436
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,862
YEAH, YOU'RE ALMOST THERE. 

437
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:26,865
GET UP TO THAT SWITCH. 
NOW, I COULDN'T REALLY HEAR - 

438
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,800
I THOUGHT THIS MIGHT BE -- 
BUT I COULDN'T HEAR THAT 
IT STOPPED, 

439
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:31,270
SO I JUST TURNED IT BACK ON. 

440
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,605
OH, YOU KNOW, OKAY. 

441
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,340
THAT WAS MY FAULT.  

442
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,509
ALL RIGHT. 
OKAY.  

443
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,745
HEY, WALTER, GOOD NEWS. 

444
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,914
GOOD NEWS. 
THE PAINT'S DRY. 

445
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:45,050
OKAY, TIME FOR THE SECOND COAT 

446
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:51,990
AWAY YOU GO. 

447
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,359
OH, HI.

448
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,631
OH, YEAH, WELCOME
TO MIKE'S TEEN TALK.

449
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:06,572
HERE'S THE NUMBER ONE LESSON
YOU CAN LEARN IN YOUR LIFE,
 

450
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:09,641
WHETHER IT'S AS YOU'RE
HANGING OUT AT THE MALL

451
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,944
OR, PERISH THE THOUGHT, AT WORK.

452
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,114
ALWAYS LOOK BUSY,

453
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,684
ESPECIALLY WHEN
YOU'RE DOING NOTHING.

454
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,888
LOOKING BUSY IS THE NEXT BEST
THING TO DOING SOMETHING,

455
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,023
ONLY IT'S A HECK OF
A LOT EASIER.

456
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,960
BUT LOOKING BUSY
IS A HARD THING TO LEARN.

457
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,261
I'LL TELL YOU.

458
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:32,030
YOU KNOW, ONE OF MY DADS
WORKED AT THE POST OFFICE,

459
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,401
AND, UH, HE HAD THIS RULE

460
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:39,304
THAT HE WOULD NEVER STAND AROUND
LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW
IN THE MORNING
 

461
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:42,541
BECAUSE THEN HE WOULDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO IN THE AFTERNOON.

462
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,010
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

463
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:46,845
LEARN HOW TO LOOK BUSY.

464
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,847
'CAUSE IF IT'S
WORTH DOING NOTHING,

465
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,216
IT'S WORTH DOING NOTHING WELL.

466
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,884
THAT'S IT.

467
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,653
[applause]

468
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:57,689
[thunder crashing]

469
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,958
[huffing and puffing]

470
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,468
HOW'S THE WEATHER?

471
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:11,503
I THINK IT'S
GONNA RAIN.

472
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,540
ARE WE ALL GONNA DIE?

473
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,609
EVENTUALLY, YEAH.

474
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,112
UH, ANY NEWS ON
YOUR WEATHER RADIOS?

475
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,347
A MINIATURE TWISTER TORE UP
THE THE ANIMAL SHELTER,

476
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,616
AND IT WAS RAINING
CATS AND DOGS FOR A WHILE.

477
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,153
HOW ARE THOSE
BOARDS HOLDING UP?

478
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,788
OH, THE BOARDS ARE GOOD.

479
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:32,357
I CHAINED ALL THE HOT WATER
HEATERS TO THE TREES.

480
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:35,093
ALL OF OUR LOOSE JUNK BLEW ONTO
THE NEIGHBOUR'S PROPERTY,

481
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,462
SO THERE'S A BONUS, ACTUALLY.

482
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,264
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T BOTHER
PUTTING THE CANOE AWAY.

483
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,732
I'M SURE IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

484
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,569
AHHH!
AHHH!
AHHH!

485
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,905
I'M GETTIN'
OUTTA HERE!

486
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,411
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHIN',
SEE YOU LATER.

487
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,513
UH, KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

488
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,916
[cheers and applause]

489
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:02,487
OKAY, GUYS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
STAND UP IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

490
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,460
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI. 

491
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,796
SIT DOWN.

492
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,964
WHOA!

493
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:17,402
ALL RIGHT, BOW YOUR HEADS
FOR THE MAN'S PRAYER.

494
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,339
I'M A MAN,
BUT I CAN CHANGE,

495
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,674
IF I HAVE TO,
I GUESS.

496
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:27,579
OH, I SAID I'LL CHANGE!

497
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:31,950


498
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,354
