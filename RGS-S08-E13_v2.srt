1
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:03,737
HERE'S A LITTLE TIP FOR THOSE

2
00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:05,505
WHO LIVE WHERE THERE'S
LOTS OF SNOW.

3
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,507
AND WITH EL NINO, THAT'S
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY.

4
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,242
NOW, TO PROTECT
THE EAVESTROUGHS FROM GETTING

5
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:10,744
THE ICE IN ON THERE.

6
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,013
YOU CAN GET THESE EXPENSIVE
KIND OF SPECIAL COILS,

7
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:14,514
OR HEATING COILS, REALLY.

8
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,516
THEY GO RIGHT ONTO
THE ROOF LIKE THAT.

9
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,752
BUT I SAY WHY BOTHER
WHEN YOU ALREADY GOT

10
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:20,286
CHRISTMAS LIGHTS UP THERE, HUH?

11
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:23,023
AFTER NEW YEAR'S, GET UP THERE,
TAKE ALL YOUR CHRISTMAS LIGHTS

12
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:26,026
OUT AND REPLACE THEM
WITH PENNIES.

13
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:28,028
WHEN THESE THINGS HEAT UP,

14
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:30,030
IT'LL MELT ALL
THE ICE ANYHOW, HUH?

15
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:32,032
IT SAVES YOU DOLLARS
AND MAKES
 CENTS.

16
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,634
YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO CHECK THE FINE PRINT

17
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,870
ON YOUR FIRE INSURANCE POLICY
BEFORE YOU TRY THIS.

18
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:40,807
IT'S THE RED GREEN SHOW!

19
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,308
[cheering]

20
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,812
AND NOW, HERE HE IS, THE MAN
WHO'S GOT SO MUCH ON THE GO,

21
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,313
THAT IT GOT UP AND WENT.

22
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,649
YOUR HOST AND HERO,
BUT MY UNCLE, RED GREEN!

23
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,217
[cheering]

24
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,494
THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
APPRECIATE IT.

25
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,830
BIG, BIG WEEK UP
AT THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

26
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:08,001
POSSUM LODGE IS ABOUT TO BE
DECLARED AN OFFICIAL RELIGION.

27
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,136
A R-R-R-RELIGION?

28
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,338
OH, PRAY TELL.

29
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,840
OH, COME ON, HAROLD.

30
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,341
HEY, IT MAKES SENSE, DOESN'T IT?

31
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,077
WE HAVE WEEKLY MEETINGS,
WE HAVE MEMBERS,

32
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:18,578
AND WE HAVE CERTAIN
UNIQUE BELIEFS

33
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:21,714
THAT SEPARATE US
FROM THE REST OF SOCIETY.

34
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:24,217
AND SOCIETY THANKS YOU FOR THAT,

35
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:27,353
BUT WHY...WHY DO YOU HAVE
TO BE A RELIGION?

36
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,855
BECAUSE THAT MAKES US

37
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,358
A REGISTERED
NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION.

38
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,828
SEE, RELIGIONS CAN DO THINGS
THAT OTHER CLUBS CAN'T.

39
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:36,329
WHAT? PERFORM
WEDDINGS?

40
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:37,831
BINGO!

41
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:39,332
OH, NO!

42
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,334
NO, WHO WOULD WANT
TO GET MARRIED HERE?

43
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,603
WHAT, YOU CAN'T WALK UP
THE AISLE WITHOUT TRIPPING

44
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,738
OVER DEAD BEARS
AND OILY CAR PARTS.

45
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,540
WHAT? NO, DON'T.

46
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:51,211
NOT WEDDINGS, HAROLD,
BINGO, YOU KNOW, BINGO.

47
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,979
YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY BINGO?

48
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,148
BINGO. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE
A FORTUNE HERE, HAROLD.

49
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,650
YOU'LL CHARGE PEOPLE
TO COME HERE TO PLAY BINGO.

50
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:59,152
BINGO.

51
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,988
AND HE THOUGHT
I WAS STUPID.

52
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,424
BINGO.

53
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,266
IT'S TIME TO PLAY
THE POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME,

54
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,268
AND TODAY'S GRAND PRIZE

00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:24,043

57
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,513

58
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:29,015

SLICKER TURNED POSSUM LAKER.

59
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,017
WELCOME.

60
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,519
[cheering]

61
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:35,522
OK, MR. BLACK, YOU HAVE
30 SECONDS TO GET

62
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:38,725
MY UNCLE RED TO SAY THIS WORD...

63
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,530
ALL RIGHT,
HAROLD.

64
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:46,032
OH, OK...AND GO.

65
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,934
OK, MR. GREEN.

66
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,870
UH, LET'S SAY
YOU BUY

67
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,372
A PIECE OF
REAL ESTATE.

68
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:53,873
OVERPAY.

69
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,143
NO, YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT
FOR MORE THAN YOU PAID FOR IT.

70
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,645
NOW, WHAT IS THAT CALLED?

71
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,280
A MIRACLE?

72
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,717
NO, ALL RIGHT, LET'S SAY
YOU BUY SOMETHING,

73
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,986
AND THEN YOU SELL IT
FOR A PROFIT

74
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,522
BEFORE YOU EVEN HAVE
TO PAY FOR IT, WHAT'S THAT?

75
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,424
THE '80s.

76
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,760
YOU'RE ALMOST OUT
OF TIME, MR. BLACK.

77
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,261
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, UH, UH.

78
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,996
MR. GREEN, LET'S SAY
I BUY SOMETHING,

79
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:19,999
THEN I IMMEDIATELY SELL IT
FOR A PROFIT, WHAT HAVE I DONE?

80
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,969
UNDERMINED THE BASIC
FABRIC OF SOCIETY.

81
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,772
[laughing]

82
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,741
YOU'RE...YOU'RE QUITE HOPELESS,
BUT I THINK YOU KNOW THAT.

83
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,743
AND I BELIEVE THAT
QUARTER SHOULD BE MINE.

84
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,912
I'LL FLIP YOU FOR IT.

85
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,414
[ringing]

86
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,950
VERY GOOD.

87
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,924
UNDER THE "B"...CASH.

88
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:48,261
UNDER THE "I"...I'M RICH.

89
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:51,264
UNDER THE "N"...

90
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,900
N YOU THOUGHT I WAS STUPID.

91
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,603
UNDER THE "G"...
GEE, LOOK AT ALL THE MONEY.

92
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:00,773
AND UNDER THE "O"...OH, YEAH.

93
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,644
YOU MADE ALL
THAT MONEY FROM BINGO?

94
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,646
YEAH, HAROLD, WE ONLY HAD
TWO BINGOS CALLED,

95
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,414
SO WE GET TO KEEP THE POT.

96
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,550
OLD MAN SEDGWICK JUMPED UP
AND YELLED, "OGNIB!",

97
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,619
BUT HIS CARD WAS UPSIDE DOWN.

98
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,523
HOW ARE YOU DOING ON THE
REGISTRATION FORM, HAROLD?

99
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,025
OH, PRETTY GOOD,
OH, PRETTY GOOD.

100
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,760
THE GOVERNMENT ASKED
A FEW MORE QUESTIONS

101
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,528
ABOUT YOUR NEW RELIGION
FOR THEIR FILES.

102
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,030
ALL RIGHT.

103
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,532
UH, THEY WANT TO KNOW
IF YOU HAVE A NAME

104
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,068
FOR YOUR NEW RELIGION --
I SUGGESTED, "GOD HELP US".

105
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:30,570
I DON'T THINK SO.

106
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,572
HOW ABOUT THE SACRED
CHURCH OF THE POSSUM?

107
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,073
SACRED CHURCH
OF THE POSSUM.

108
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,409
DO YOU HAVE
A PATRON SAINT?

109
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,311
SAINT BERNARD.

110
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,549
AND HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT LIFE AFTER DEATH?

111
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,785
OH, I DON'T KNOW, HAROLD.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

112
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,287
I BELIEVE IN LIFE BEFORE DEATH.

113
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:48,788
SO, YOU JUST-- I DON'T CARE.

114
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,556
YOU FILL OUT ANY WAY YOU WANT.

115
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,225
YOU CAN MAKE YOURSELF
A SACRIFICIAL VIRGIN.

116
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,726
[ CHUCKLING ]

117
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,962
NO, NO, NO, I'M GOING
TO BE A DEACON.

118
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,464
YEAH, YEAH, 'CAUSE I-- YOU KNOW,
LIKE A SAINTLY PRESENCE.

119
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:01,200
LIKE AN ANGEL THAT SHINES
A LIGHT FOR ALL TO SEE.

120
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,736
A BEACON OF HOPE FOR THE MEEK
AND THE DOWNTRODDEN.

121
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,238
THAT'S GOOD.

122
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,739
YEAH, YEAH.

123
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,741
I'M GOING TO CALL MYSELF
DEACON BEACON.

124
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,443
OK?

125
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,012
HEY, YOU CAN ANSWER THE PHONE...

126
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:17,450
"DON'T BE FREAKIN', THIS IS
GEEKIN' DEACON BEACON SPEAKIN'."

127
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,118
BINGO.

128
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,524
THERE'S A DAMPNESS
IN THE MEADOW 

129
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,326
WHEN THE OLD RED
ROOSTER CALLS 

130
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:28,027
THERE'S A LOT
OF CONDENSATION 

131
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,096
WHERE THE ROOF USED
TO JOIN THE WALLS 

132
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,065
THERE'S A WETNESS
IN MY MATTRESS 

133
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:33,833
AND PUDDLES ON THE DRESSER 

134
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,902
THE LESSON HERE
IS DON'T MAKE BEER 

135
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,237
IF YOUR TANK CAN'T
HOLD THE PRESSURE 

136
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,974
OH, YEAH.

137
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,476
YOU KNOW, IN HIS LIFETIME,

138
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,778
MY DAD HAD A LOT
OF PRETTY DISTINCTIVE CARS:

139
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,215
THE OLD DeSOTO THERE WITH
THE BIG FINS ON HER, HA, HA.

140
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,951
OH, GOSH, YEAH, THE BIG HEAVY
STUDEBAKER, REMEMBER THEM?

141
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,188
POINTED AT BOTH ENDS,
JUST LIKE DAD, HA, HA.

142
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:57,824
OH, MAN, I LOVED THE CORVAIR.

143
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,826
IT HAD THE FANCY TRIM
ON THE SIDE.

144
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:02,795
ANOTHER DENT ON THE ROOF EVERY
TIME YOU FLIPPED HER, YEAH.

145
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,032
THESE THINGS, THE GAS MILEAGE
WAS BRUTAL ON THEM, THERE.

146
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,835
AND THE BODY WOULD RUST OUT
EVERY THREE YEARS ON HER,

147
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:11,838
AND ANY COLLISION OVER 10 MILES
AN HOUR, OF COURSE, WAS FATAL.

148
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,506
BUT YOU JUST DIDN'T CARE, HA.

149
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,242
OF COURSE, NOWADAYS, THE WAY
THEY'RE MAKING THE CARS,

150
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,744
THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME.

151
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,746
THIS IS 'CAUSE THEY GOT
COMPUTERS DESIGN THEM,

152
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:22,482
SO THEY'RE AERODYNAMIC AND FUEL
EFFICIENT AND ALL THAT STUFF.

153
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,984
BUT, HEY, AFTER YOU DO
A LITTLE BIT OF SHOPPING

154
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,986
OR MAYBE PACK FOR A TRIP
OR SOMETHING,

155
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,721
THAT THEORY GOES OUT THE WINDOW.

156
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:31,991
OF COURSE, THE FUNDAMENTAL
PROBLEM WITH THIS

157
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,494
IS THE MESSAGE THAT ALL
CARS SHOULD BE THE SAME.

158
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,263
HOW LONG IS IT GOING TO BE
BEFORE THEY START SAYING

159
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,265
THAT ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD BE THE SAME, EH?

160
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:42,402
THEN A LOT OF US ARE
IN TROUBLE, ESPECIALLY ME.

161
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:45,772
TO ME, PEOPLE ARE
DISTINCTIVE INDIVIDUALS

162
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:48,274
AND THEIR VEHICLES
SHOULD REFLECT THAT.

163
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:52,445
SO THIS WEEK,
ON HANDYMAN CORNER,

164
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:55,214
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW
YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE YOUR CAR,

165
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:58,217
SO THAT IT'LL STAND OUT
ON THE ROAD, IN THE PARKING LOT,

166
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,953
AND IN THE POLICE COMPOUND --
LET'S START WITH THE FRONT END.

167
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,456
SEE, I KIND OF GOT A PIECE
OF GARDEN HOSE--

168
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:04,957
THIS HAS BEEN SITTING ON HERE,

169
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,959
OUT IN THE SUN,
FOR ABOUT THREE DAYS.

170
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,961
AND IT HAS ACTUALLY
TAKEN ON THE SHAPE

171
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,596
OF THE FRONT END OF THE CAR.

172
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:12,865
SO, NOW THIS BECOMES
OUR PATTERN, EH, OUR JIG,

173
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,735
SO WE CAN CUT SOMETHING OUT,
MAKE A LITTLE PIECE OF TRIM

174
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,870
THAT WILL GO RIGHT ON
AND FIT PERFECTLY

175
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,539
ONTO THE FRONT END OF THE CAR.

176
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,407
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO USE?

177
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,112
DON'T GET AHEAD OF ME NOW.

178
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:29,549
ALL RIGHT, I GOT MY PATTERN
ALL TRACED OUT ON THE CANOE NOW.

179
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,818
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS CUT HER OFF.

180
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,987
AND FOR THAT, I'M GOING TO USE

181
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:36,756
ONE OF THESE FANCY
LITTLE COPING SAWS.

182
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,658
IT'S JUST IDEAL FOR
CUTTING CURVY LINES.

183
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,717
ALL RIGHT, THE SAW
SEEMS TO BE COPING

184
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,219
A LITTLE BETTER THAN I AM.

185
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,421
[chain saw starting]

186
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,727
AH, SHE'S REALLY STARTING
TO TAKE SHAPE, ISN'T SHE?

187
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,729
AND HOW ABOUT THIS LITTLE
NIFTY FEATURE, HUH?

188
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,731
HIDEAWAY HEADLIGHTS.

189
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,433
ACTUALLY, THESE ARE
JUST PAILS, YEAH.

190
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,935
YOU CUT THEM OUT AND LEAVE
THE BOTTOM IN THERE.

191
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,471
SEE, SO UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS,
THE HEADLIGHT IS HIDDEN.

192
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,206
BUT AS YOU GET GOING,

193
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,942
THE WIND GRABS HERE AND JUST
LIFTS THIS BABY RIGHT UP

194
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,844
AND EXPOSES THE HEADLIGHT, SEE?

195
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,614
SO THE FASTER YOU GO,
THE BETTER YOU CAN SEE, HUH?

196
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,849
SO IF YOU'RE DRIVING AT NIGHT
AND THE VISIBILITY

197
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,584
IS NOT TOO GOOD, JUST SPEED UP.

198
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:42,421
BY THE WAY, THESE HINGES
ARE 100% DUCT TAPE,

199
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,156
AND IT'S CALLED
THE HIMMELMAN HINGE.

200
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,758
HIMMELMAN WAS ACTUALLY
A LODGE MEMBER.

201
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,261
HE WAS ACTUALLY BY THE LODGE
THE OTHER DAY,

202
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,763
BUT HIS ARTIFICIAL KNEES
HAVE NOT WORKED OUT SO WELL...

203
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,933
IN THE HOT WEATHER, THEY STICK
TO THE INSIDE OF HIS PANT LEGS.

204
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,935
ANYWAY, SPEAKING OF HIMMELMAN,

205
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,604
LET'S DO SOMETHING
FOR THE BACK END.

206
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,708
ALL RIGHT NOW, THIS IS ACTUALLY
JUST AN IRONING BOARD,

207
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,710
BUT I'M USING IT
AS A SPOILER, HUH?

208
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,712
HEH, HEH, HEH, I FEEL SPOILED.

209
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,381
WELL, SOMETHING'S SPOILED,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

210
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,216
AND YOU SEE THESE FINS?

211
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,717
CANOE PADDLES, HA, HA, HA.

212
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,219
THAT'S ALL THIS IS.

213
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,720
HOW ABOUT THIS?

214
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,956
SEE MY ROLLBAR HERE?
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?

215
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,724
IT'S A KID'S SWING, HUH?

216
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,459
IT'S AMAZING
WHAT A PERSON CAN DO.

217
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,229
YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT BUGS ME
TOO ABOUT THE NEW CARS?

218
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,231
THEY COME WITH
NO CHROME ON THEM, HUH?

219
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,732
FULLY LOADED, NO CHROME, NONE.

220
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,234
I DON'T GO FOR THAT.

221
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,736
SO I'M GOING TO ADD
SOME CHROME TO THIS BABY.

222
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:33,739
AND YOU CAN GET A TAPE
LIKE IT'S KIND OF A MYLAR.

223
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,474
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE
WHAT IT'S CALLED,

224
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,877
BUT IT'S LIKE DUCT TAPE,
ONLY SILVERIER.

225
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:41,080
JUST LAY IT DOWN...

226
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:44,183
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING LIKE
CHROME TO CREATE AN IMAGE, EH?

227
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,687
I BET THIS IS BURNING A PRETTY
GOOD IMAGE INTO THAT TV CAMERA.

228
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,522
BUT THAT'S JUST HOW EASY IT IS

229
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,257
TO LET PEOPLE KNOW
THAT YOU'RE DIFFERENT.

230
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,758
YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THEM.

231
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:54,260
IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD,

232
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,862
AND IT'LL MAKE THEM FEEL
EVEN BETTER.

233
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,265
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME...

234
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,300
[engine sputtering
and finally starting]

235
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,403
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

236
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,680
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU GUYS

237
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,617
WHO ARE GOING TO FACE
A PROBLEM WHEN YOU GET OLDER.

238
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,853
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
EXTRA EAR AND NOSE HAIR.

239
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,956
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE INABILITY

240
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,859
TO REMEMBER SPECIAL OCCASIONS.

241
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,730
THE DAY WILL COME WHEN
SUDDENLY YOU REALIZE

242
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,832
THAT LAST YEAR YOU FORGOT
HER BIRTHDAY,

243
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:35,601
YOUR ANNIVERSARY,
VALENTINE'S DAY AND CHRISTMAS.

244
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:41,674
I KNOW, NOBODY REMEMBERS YOUR
SPECIAL OCCASIONS, DO THEY, EH?

245
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,809
OPENING DAY OF BASS SEASON.

246
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,748
ANYBODY BUY YOU A BAG OF WORMS?

247
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,249
YOU CAN LIVE WITH
THEIR INSENSITIVITY,

248
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,251
BUT THEY CAN'T HANDLE YOURS.

249
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,254
AND RIGHT NOW YOU'RE THINKING,
WASN'T IT ABOUT A YEAR AGO

250
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,256
YOU GOT INTO TROUBLE
FOR SOMETHING OR OTHER?

251
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,758
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

252
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,761
YOU GOT A SPECIAL OCCASION
COMING UP, DON'T YOU?

253
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,664
AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IT IS, DO YOU?

254
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,734
WELL, NEITHER DO I.

255
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,038
BUT HERE'S WHAT YOU DO.

256
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:15,641
GO OUT NOW AND BUY
A GIFT NOW, ALL RIGHT?

257
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,644
WRAP IT UP,
HIDE IT IN THE GARAGE NOW.

258
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,447
GET A FLOWERY CARD
THAT JUST SAYS

259
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,482
"I LOVE YOU" ON IT, ALL RIGHT?

260
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,785
NOW, JUST WAIT AROUND
FOR THE DAY IN QUESTION.

261
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,854
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TELL BECAUSE
SHE'LL BE TICKED OFF WITH YOU.

262
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:34,493
SHE'LL GET INTO THE SIGHING,
TAPPING HER FOOT ON THE FLOOR,

263
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,796
SAYING STUFF LIKE,
"YOU KNOW, I COULD HAVE MARRIED"

264
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,464
"ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS."

265
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,834
WHAT YOU DO THEN,
GO GET THE GIFT,

266
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,335
BRING IT OUT,
JUST YELL, "SURPRISE!"

267
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:46,238
"SURPRISE," LIKE THAT. IT WILL
MAKE YOU LOOK LIKE A HERO.

268
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,808
YOU MIGHT EVEN GET TO SLEEP
IN YOUR OWN BED.

269
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:51,877
AND MAYBE NOT RIGHT AWAY.

270
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,381
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

271
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,316
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

272
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,690
YOU ARE IN SUCH TROUBLE, MISTER.

273
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:07,326
JUST STAY CALM,
HAROLD, ALL RIGHT?

274
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,695
WE'RE CAUGHT ON A LITTLE
TECHNICALITY ON THE LODGE

275
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,197
BEING AN ORGANIZED RELIGION.

276
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,699
PROBABLY NEED TO BE
A BIT MORE ORGANIZED, I GUESS.

277
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,868
YEAH, GOVERNMENT SAYS
YOU'RE NOT EVEN A RELIGION.

278
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:19,271
SAYS YOU'RE NOT EVEN
A PAGAN RITUAL.

279
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:22,007
AND YOU GOT TO HAVE A GAMING
LICENCE TO RUN BINGO.

280
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,744
NOW WE ALL GOT TO GO JAIL
AND EAT BLAND FOOD

281
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,312
AND MARRY OUR OWN GENDER -- OH!

282
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,248
NO, NO, NO--
YES, YES!

283
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:30,750
HAROLD.
WHAT?

284
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:32,251
DON'T PANIC, OK?

285
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,754
WE'RE NOT DONE YET.

286
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,255
OHHH.

287
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,758
I HAD, I HAD A MEETING
WITH THE CHURCH ELDERS.

288
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,326
WE SACRIFICED A COUPLE OF BEERS.

289
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:44,964
AND, UH, WE CAME UP WITH A PLAN,
WHAT WE CALL OUR HOLY DOCTRINE.

290
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,465
THE GOVERNMENT BOYS
ARE COMING TONIGHT

291
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,968
TO LOOK AT OUR BINGO GAME --
WE MUST CONVINCE THEM

292
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,569
THAT IT'S ACTUALLY
A CHURCH SERVICE.

293
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,738
OH!

294
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,740
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO THAT?

295
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,909
WELL, WE GOT SINNERS.
THAT'S A GOOD START.

296
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,410
YEAH, WE
GOT THOSE.

297
00:12:58,477 --> 00:12:59,912
WE FIGURE WE'LL HAVE
SOME CONFESSIONS.

298
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,847
YOU KNOW HOW THE GUYS
LOVE TO BRAG.

299
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:05,117
ALL WE NEED NOW IS JUST A
SERMON TO TOP THAT OFF, HAROLD.

300
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,619
YOU'RE NOT TELLING
YOUR STORY ABOUT

301
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,187
THE BIRD AND THE MANURE AGAIN?

302
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,688
OH, NO, NO, NOT ME, HAROLD.

303
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,690
YOU'RE THE DEACON.
YOU'LL BE DOING THE CEREMONY.

304
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,626
ME? NO WAY!

305
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,861
NO! UH-UH.

306
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,264
NO, NO.
YES, YES.

307
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,266
I'VE EXCOMMUNICATED
MYSELF FROM

308
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,334
THIS CULT.

309
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,336
NO, YOU SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE

310
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,838
YOU TOOK YOUR VOWS, YOUNG MAN.

311
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,339
DON'T WORRY, I CAN HELP YOU.

312
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:28,841
WE'LL BE FINE.

313
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,343
WE WON'T BE ABLE TO FAKE OUT
THESE GOVERNMENT PEOPLE.

314
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,345
SURE WE ARE.
THEY'RE FROM THE TAX DEPARTMENT.

315
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:34,914
THEY'VE NEVER BEEN
TO CHURCH EITHER.

316
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,919
WELCOME TO THE
EXPERT PORTION OF THE SHOW.

317
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,354
THIS IS THE PART
OF THE PROGRAM WHERE WE EXAMINE

318
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,857
THOSE THREE LITTLE WORDS
THAT MEN FIND HARD TO SAY.

319
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,525
I DON'T KNOW.

320
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,027
HA, HA, THAT'S GOOD.

321
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:51,697
AND JOINING MY UNCLE TODAY
IS RANGER GORD.

322
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,732
[cheering]

323
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,604
OK, HERE WE GO.

324
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,105
LETTER NUMBER ONE.

325
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,843
"DEAR EXPERTS, RANGER GORD IS
THE BEST PERSON ON YOUR SHOW."

326
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:06,812
"HE IS DOWN TO EARTH,
YET UNCOMMONLY BRILLIANT."

327
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,883
"ALL THE WOMEN IN POSSUM LAKE"

328
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,619
"MUST BE CRAZY FOR HIM."

329
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:17,489
AW, GORD DOESN'T NEED ANYBODY
TO BE CRAZY FOR HIM.

330
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,063
I THINK THERE'S
MORE THERE, HAROLD.

331
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:27,299
OH, UH, "THERE IS NO ONE
BETTER THAN RANGER GORD"

332
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,401
"ON THE SHOW, IS THERE?"

333
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:32,037
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
UH, I DOUBT IT.

334
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,839
RED, WHAT'S
YOU'RE FEELING ON THAT?

335
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,810
WHO WROTE THAT LETTER, HAROLD?

336
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,380
OK, NOT REALLY THE PERFECT
CRIME, GORD.

337
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,282
MAYBE YOU
SHOULDN'T HAVE SIGNED IT.

338
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,255
YOU KNOW, THAT'S
NOT NECESSARILY MY LETTER, RED.

339
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:52,558
SOME DERANGED PERSON MAY HAVE
WROTE IT AND PUT MY NAME TO IT.

340
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,526
YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M SAYING.

341
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:00,633
[red]: BOY, OH, BOY, THAT'S
A SCARY-LOOKING THING, ISN'T IT?

342
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,768
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
WHAT YOU DOING, BILL?

343
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,536
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?

344
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:06,305
LITTLE, UH--
THAT'S A FUNNY LITTLE HAMMER.

345
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,073
KIND OF A PICKAXE KIND OF A...

346
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,542
PAINTBRUSH. WHAT'S THAT FOR,
BILL? WHAT'S GOING ON?

347
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,211
OH, BOY.

348
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,647
YOU MUST GET UP EARLY
IN THE MORNING

349
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,448
TO GET DRESSED, I'M THINKING.

350
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:19,018
YOU HAD, UH...
BILL HAD, UH... WOW.

351
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:22,221
HOLY SMOKES. WHAT DO YOU GOT?

352
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,989
I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE,

353
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,258
BUT I'M GOING TO STAND BACK
A LITTLE BIT.

354
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,761
WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE?
OH, MY GOSH, OH, JEEZ.

355
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,329
LOOK, HE PASSED A STOOL.

356
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,298
OK.

357
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,199
WHAT, WHAT'S GOING ON?

358
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,868
WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?

359
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,771
OH, I GET-- IT'S LIKE
AN ARCHEOLOGY-- YEAH, OK,

360
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,272
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
NO, THANKS.

361
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,774
I'M GOING TO-- I'M RELAXING.

362
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,710
OH, BOY, OH, BOY. THERE YOU GO.
THAT WILL BE MY JOB.

363
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,712
I'LL SIT IN THE CHAIR, BILL.
GO AHEAD.

364
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,949
I KNOW, YOU GOT TO DIG A HOLE --
YOU GO DIG A HOLE,

365
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,951
AND YOU CALL ME
WHEN THE HOLE'S DONE.

366
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,219
OH, HEY, HEY,
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

367
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,955
HAVE YOU DUG THE HOLE YET, BILL?

368
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,456
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE?

369
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:58,958
OH, MY GOSH.

370
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,726
HOLY COW.

371
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,227
HI, EVERYBODY.

372
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,797
LOOK, I DUG
A HOLE.

373
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,532
WOW, HOLY SMOKES.

374
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,033
OH, YOU'VE MARKED
ALL THE LAYERS.

375
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,768
THERE'S THE '90's, YES.

376
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,604
WHAT'S THAT? A CASSETTE.
THEY GOT A CASSETTE TAPE THERE.

377
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,406
THE '80's, YEAH,
I REMEMBER THE '80's.

378
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,908
THEN YOU HAVE THE '70's.

379
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,409
WHAT'S THAT? AN EIGHT-TRACK.

380
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,712
OH, GOD, OH, BOY, OH, BOY.

381
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,613
WOW, WOW, THE '60's.

382
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,382
YOU GOT A RECORD.
YOU GOT EVERYTHING.

383
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,917
YOU GOT ANY MORE STUFF THERE?

384
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,919
FUNNY HOW IT GOES IN LAYERS,
ISN'T IT?

385
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,787
WHAT DO YOU GOT? OR MORE STUFF.

386
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:32,925
ARE THESE REALLY ARTIFACTS,
DO YOU THINK?

387
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,426
A PIECE OF A BIKE.

388
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,162
OLD GAS CANS ARE NOT REAL--
THIS IS A JUNK PILE.

389
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,665
COME ON UP, COME ON UP,
AND I'LL COME DOWN.

390
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,367
ALL RIGHT.

391
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:46,538
BOY, OH, BOY, THIS IS,
THIS IS AN ODD FEELING

392
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,207
TO BE DOWN IN A--

393
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,975
OH, THAT HURT, THAT HURT.

394
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,543
OH!

395
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,445
 COME LISTEN TO MY STORY-- 

396
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,147
OH, NO.

397
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:59,018
WHEN BILL THINKS THAT HE'S FOUND

398
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:00,753
SOME BONES OF SOME ANIMAL
OR SOMETHING,

399
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,988
IT'S JUST AN OIL CAN,
JUST AN OIL CAN.

400
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,723
THAT'S THE WAY MY LIFE
GOES SOMETIMES.

401
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,225
THERE WE GO.

402
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,960
NO, BILL, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S, NO.

403
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,462
IT'S NOT A PREHISTORIC ANIMAL,
IT'S JUST...

404
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:18,003
IT'S, NO, NO, I DON'T...
I DON'T THINK SO.

405
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,572
NO, NO, NO, NO.

406
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,174
WATCH YOUR STEP.

407
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,976
OH, BOY.

408
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,978
YEAH, YEAH.

409
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,981
NOW, WE THOUGHT THAT WAS
PRETTY MUCH THE END OF THE DAY,

410
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,483
BUT WHEN HE LANDED, HE FOUND
SOMETHING KIND OF UNUSUAL.

411
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,752
HE MAY BE ONTO SOMETHING HERE,
MAYBE ONTO SOMETHING.

412
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,754
OH, MY GOSH,
IT'S A LICENCE PLATE THERE.

413
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,523
IT'S A LICENCE PLATE.

414
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:40,159
"YOURS TO DISCOVER."
WHAT WOULD THAT BE? MY GOD.

415
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,660
WHAT HAVE WE GOT OVER HERE?

416
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,196
OH, IT'S A HEADLIGHT, AND IT'S--

417
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,532
BOY, THERE'S SOMETHING,
SOMETHING UNDER...

418
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,567
ALL RIGHT, I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

419
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,502
LOOK OUT, DON'T CATCH ME.

420
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,638
DON'T HELP ME, BILL.

421
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:55,240
LOOK, LOOK, ANOTHER HEADLIGHT.

422
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,875
TWO HEADLIGHTS IN A...

423
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,377
WELL, THIS IS...

424
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,112
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK IT IS?

425
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,114
I THINK IT'S A CAR. YES, IT IS!

426
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,116
WELL, I GOT ALL
THE DIRT OFF THERE,

427
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:06,351
AND I GOT THE OIL
POURED INTO HER THERE.

428
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,853
AND HERE'S SOMETHING,
25 YEARS LATER,

429
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,323
THE ENGINE STILL RUNS,
TRANSMISSION STILL WORKS.

430
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,325
HERE'S SOMETHING WE LEARNED.

431
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,027
THE BRAKES ARE SHOT.

432
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,296
OH, BOY, OH, BOY, OH, DEAR.

433
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:23,702
I'LL GET IT, I'LL GET IT,
I'LL GET IT, I'LL GET IT.

434
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,671
CAREFUL, CAREFUL, THERE WE GO.

435
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,642
THIS IS A SPECIAL FEATURE
OF THE SHOW WE CALL

436
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:33,078
YOU AND YOUR ANIMAL, 
HOSTED BY LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL

437
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:34,580
OFFICER ED FRID -- WELCOME, ED.

438
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,081
RED.

439
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,350
[cheering]

440
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,789
I'LL TELL YOU, THE, UH, THE
YOUNGSTERS LOVE THESE ANIMALS.

441
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,958
SO, WHAT DID YOU BRING
FOR US TODAY?

442
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,459
A COUPLE CREATURES.

443
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:50,395
UH, FIRST, A SNAKE.

444
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,998
WOW! HEY, I'M IMPRESSED, ED.

445
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,766
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE AFRAID OF SNAKES.

446
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,335
OH, YEAH.

447
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,438
BUT I DON'T LET ON, EH.

448
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:06,145
OK, SO THIS IS THE LARGEST SNAKE
WE GET IN NORTH AMERICA, OK?

449
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,646
THIS IS

450
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:11,216
AN INDIGO SNAKE, AND, BOY...

451
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:14,853
HAVE WE GOT A BIG SPECIMEN.

452
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,693
WAIT TILL YOU SEE
THE SIZE OF THIS BABY.

453
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,677
WELL, I GUESS I FORGOT
TO BRING HIM.

454
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,879
ED, THERE'S A...

455
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,381
SOMETHING MOVING UNDER
YOUR SHIRT, THERE.

456
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:45,384
IS THERE ANY CHANCE THE SNAKE
GOT INSIDE YOUR SHIRT AT ALL?

457
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,586
OHHH!

458
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:50,556
I DON'T LIKE THE WAY
THIS IS GOING.

459
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,457
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

460
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,260
WE'LL USE A LITTLE BIT OF BAIT.
WHAT DO THEY EAT?

461
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,762
MICE.

462
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:59,431
LITTLE FURRY WARM MICE.

463
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,200
OK, I GOT A PIECE OF CHEESE.

464
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:04,069
I'LL PUT THAT DOWN --
NOW, LOOK, WE'LL GET HIM TO GO

465
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,638
DOWN OUT-- JUST STAY STILL --
CAN YOU STAND STILL?

466
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,207
YEAH, OH, YEAH.

467
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,411
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DIDN'T
NOTICE A SNAKE IN YOUR SHIRT.

468
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:13,912
WELL, YOU KNOW,
YOU GET BUSY.

469
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,481
AND, UH, YOU KNOW,

470
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,251
I CAN'T BE CHECKING MY CLOTHES
FOR SNAKES EVERY FIVE MINUTES.

471
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,852
BUT I THINK I MIGHT START.

472
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,354
I GOT HIM,
I GOT HIM!

473
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,855
OH, GOD!

474
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,424
BR-R-R-R!

475
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:32,064
I GUESS, UH, I GUESS THAT'S
THE END OF THAT SEGMENT, IS IT?

476
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,732
NO.

477
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,101
I ALSO BROUGHT A TARANTULA.

478
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,241
OOH, OOH, OOH!

479
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,810
MAN, THAT WAS
RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION.

480
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,311
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

481
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:47,813
UNBELIEVABLE.

482
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,314
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THE GOD-FEARING

483
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,816
LODGE MEMBERS
ATTACKED

484
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:52,317
A MAN OF
THE CLOTH.

485
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:56,054
WELL, YOUR SERMON
DIDN'T HELP, HAROLD.

486
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:58,056
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T WARM UP
A CONGREGATION

487
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,958
BY CALLING THEM
THE SPAWN OF SATAN.

488
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:03,762
YOU DIDN'T HELP MATTERS EITHER
WITH YOUR PHONEY COMMANDMENTS.

489
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,597
"THOU SHALT NOT TIP."

490
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,935
I...I JUST THOUGHT THE
BINGO THING WAS A GREAT IDEA.

491
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,838
UNDER THE "R", WRONG.

492
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:17,309
ALL RIGHT, HAROLD,
I WAS OUT OF LINE,

493
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,844
BUT YOU HAVE TO FORGIVE ME.

494
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,445
FOR-- WHY?

495
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,781
IT'S YOUR JOB.
YOU'RE THE FREAKIN' DEACON.

496
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,950
[squealing]

497
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,451
MEETING TIME.

498
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:28,720
YOU GO AHEAD, YOUR WORSHIP.
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

499
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,222
OK.

500
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,890
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING, I'LL BE

501
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,392
COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

502
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,661
AND I THINK I'M IN NEED
OF A MIRACLE,

503
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:38,363
PERHAPS A LAYING ON OF HANDS.

504
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,365
FOR THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

505
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,868
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND HAROLD AND THE WHOLE GANG

506
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:45,871
UP HERE AT POSSUM LODGE,
YOU KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

507
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,040
