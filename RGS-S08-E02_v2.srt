1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,904
LET'S FACE IT,
MEN AND PAINT DON'T MIX.

2
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:06,673
YOU GUYS PROMISE
TO DO THE PAINTING.

3
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,508
YOU EVEN GO OUT
AND BUY THE PAINT,

4
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:11,044
BUT BY THE TIME YOU'RE ACTUALLY
UP THE LADDER WITH
A BRUSH IN HAND,

5
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:14,014
EVERYTHING SETTLES TO
THE BOTTOM OF THE CAN.

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,016
AND SAME WITH THE PAINT.

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:20,120
NOW, STIRRING PAINT IS MESSY
AND SLOW AND... WORK.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,122
SO HERE'S A HANDY TIP.

9
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:24,924
LET YOUR CAR DO THE MIXING.

10
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:30,130
DUCT TAPE A CAN TO THE CENTRE OF
THE WHEEL AND THEN DRIVE AROUND.

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,167
IN TWO MINUTES THAT BABY'LL POUR
LIKE THE DAY IT LEFT THE STORE.

12
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:37,670
JUST MAKE SURE IT'S TAPED ON
THERE NICE AND TIGHT.

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,674
AND MAKE SURE THE LID IS ON
THE CAN NICE AND TIGHT, TOO.

14
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,212
IT'S  THE RED GREEN SHOW!

15
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:49,983
AND NOW HERE'S THE MAN WHO MAKES
IT ALL LOOK SO EASY.

16
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,684
AND SO CHEAP... AND SO MESSY.

17
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:54,487
YOUR HOST AND HERO, MY UNCLE...

18
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,756
RED GREEN!!!

19
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:10,770
THANK-YOU VERY MUCH.
APPRECIATE IT.

20
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,338
BIG, BIG, BIG, BIG, BIG WEEK

21
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:13,706
UP AT THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

22
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:15,975
HAROLD, YOU'RE GONNA BE
SO PROUD OF ME.

23
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:18,945
I WOULD WELCOME THAT.

24
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:20,847
ACTUALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING IS...

25
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:22,415
WE'RE BUILDING A LITTLE
RACE TRACK, UP HERE,

26
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,085
FOR OUR 4X4s AND RIDING MOWERS

27
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:29,289
AND WHATEVER EQUIPMENT THE GUYS
CAN SNEAK HOME FROM WORK.

28
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:32,625
STINKY PETERSON HAS A FORKLIFT
THAT CAN DO 70 CLICKS.

29
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,661
BUT NOW, THERE'S AN OLD BUILDING

30
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,996
RIGHT WHERE WE WANT
TO PUT THE CHICANE.

31
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:39,032
THAT'S THE ORIGINAL
POSSUM LODGE.

32
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,166
OH, THAT'S AN
EXCELLENT EXAMPLE

33
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,001
OF EARLY PIONEER
BOARD AND BATTEN.

34
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:45,305
NOW ORDINARILY, WE WOULD JUST
FLATTEN THAT WITH A BACKHOE

35
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,274
OR A WRECKING BALL
OR MOOSE THOMPSON,

36
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:52,178
BUT THIS TIME, WE'RE GONNA DO
THE POLITICALLY CORRECT THING.

37
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:54,781
AS A FAVOUR TO THE LOCAL
HISTORICAL SOCIETY,

38
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,885
WE'RE GONNA ACTUALLY MOVE
THE BUILDING TO A SAFER SPOT.

39
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:02,355
THAT IS GREAT NEWS.
THAT'S FANTASTIC!!!

40
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:04,624
WOULD YOU LIKE THE NAME
OF A COMPANY THAT DOES
THAT SORT OF THING?

41
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,626
THAT MOVES OLD
PIONEER BUILDINGS
AND THINGS?

42
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,728
BECAUSE THEY HAVE
COMPANIES THAT DO
THAT SORT OF THING.

43
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:10,296
THEY HAVE
THE PROPER EQUIPMENT
AND THE EXPERIENCE...

44
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,165
WHY DO I
EVEN BOTHER?

45
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:18,171
YOU THINK WE'RE GONNA SPEND
FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS TO MOVE
A TWO-DOLLAR BUILDING?

46
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,673
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

47
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:22,108
YOU'RE GONNA SPEND
A LOT MORE THAN THAT

48
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,544
IF YOU INCLUDE
THE MEDICAL BILLS.

49
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,279
YOU SEE, THAT'S
THE THING, EH.

50
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:29,716
YOU YOUNG GUYS TRY
TO SOLVE ALL YOUR PROBLEMS
BY WRITING A CHEQUE.

51
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,151
WHEREAS, THE MEN
OF POSSUM LODGE

52
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,319
TAKE ACTION WITH
OUR OWN HANDS.

53
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:37,490
AH, THAT EXPLAINS
THE MISSING FINGERS.

54
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,627
WELL HAROLD,
SOMETIMES ONE
IS ENOUGH.

55
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,204
IT'S TIME FOR 
"THE POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME."

56
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:52,705
AND THIS WEEK,
MR. MIKE HAMAR'S

57
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:54,507
PLAYING FOR A TRULY
FABULOUS PRIZE

58
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,043
SUPPLIED BY
THE POSSUM LAKE
CREDIT UNION.

59
00:02:57,043 --> 00:03:01,214
THE CREDIT UNION WILL
TEAR UP YOUR MORTGAGE
FREE OF CHARGE.

60
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,516
REPOSSESSION HAS
NEVER BEEN SO EASY.

61
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,985
NO FEES, NO FUSS,
NO HOUSE.

62
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,720
UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE
30 SECONDS, OR SO,

63
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,656
TO GET MR. MIKE HAMAR
TO SAY THIS WORD:

64
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,297
GO!

65
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,766
MIKE, WHEN YOU
HAVE A BEER,
THAT'S CALLED...?

66
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:20,934
BREAKFAST?

67
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,102
[laughter]

68
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,205
OKAY, LET'S SAY
YOU'RE THIRSTY,

69
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,607
YOU GO DOWN TO THE 7-11
FOR SOMETHING COLD,

70
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:28,741
THAT'S CALLED...?

71
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,410
SHOPLIFTING?

72
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,878
[laughter]

73
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,347
NO, NO, I'M SAYING, LIKE,
WHAT WOULD YOU CALL THE DRINK!

74
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,782
EVIDENCE.

75
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,517
[laughter]

76
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:40,453
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT
JUST A TERM FOR
A DRINK.

77
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:42,388
WHISKEY!

78
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:45,792
NO, A GENERIC WORD
FOR A DRINK?

79
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,727
POTATO SKIN WINE.

80
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,262
[laughter]

81
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,997
DO YOU KNOW WHAT GENERIC MEANS?

82
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,199
CHEAP.

83
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,501
OKAY, FORGET
THE ALCOHOL.

84
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,170
WHAT DO YOU CALL
A SOFT DRINK?

85
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,638
MIX.

86
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,506
[laughter]

87
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,508
ALMOST OUT OF TIME,
UNCLE RED.

88
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:04,177
ALL RIGHT MIKE,

89
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,213
IN PRISON, WHEN YOU GET A MEAL
IT ALWAYS COMES WITH A...?

90
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,681
HAIR IN IT.

91
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,283
[loud laughter]

92
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,985
OH YEAH,
OH YEAH.

93
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,953
AT LEAST WITH THE FOOD
YOU CAN SEE WHAT IT IS,

94
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:16,422
BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT'S FLOATIN'
AROUND IN THE BEVERAGE.

95
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,858
[ring! ring! ring!]

96
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,861
[applause and cheering]

97
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,632
YOU CAN'T TEAR
THAT BUILDING DOWN.

98
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,300
IT'LL DISINTEGRATE.

99
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,535
IF YOU'RE GONNA MOVE IT,
YOU HAVE TO MOVE IT INTACT.

100
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:30,737
YOU KNOW, ONE BIG PIECE.

101
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:31,971
PLEASE CALL A
PROFESSIONAL.

102
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,239
THEY HAVE
THE PROPER JACKS

103
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:36,442
AND THEY GOT A VEHICLE
WITH ABOUT FORTY
WHEELS ON IT.

104
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,744
OH, REALLY?

105
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,980
WELL, GUESS WHAT
MR. FLAKY SPECKS
ON HIS LENSES?

106
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,716
[laughter]

107
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,452
WE HAVE A VEHICLE
WITH 52 WHEELS.

108
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,222
YOU HAVE A VEHICLE
WITH 52 WHEELS?
YES, SIR.

109
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:52,659
YOU DO NOT!

110
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,127
OH NO, LEMME GUESS.

111
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,329
YOU GOT
THE DELIVERY TRUCK
FROM THE TIRE COMPANY?

112
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,399
NO, NO, NO.
GO TAKE A LOOK
IN THE PARKING LOT.

113
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,867
52 WHEELS?

114
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:04,437
WHAT KIND OF VEHICLE
HAS 52 WHEELS ON IT?

115
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,573
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING
WITH 52 WHEELS ON IT.

116
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:10,710
YEAH...
DO YOU SEE
13 PICKUP TRUCKS?

117
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:15,348
[laughter]

118
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,550
OH NO!!!
YES, YES!

119
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:22,922
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO
IS WE'RE GONNA JACK
THE OLD BUILDING UP.

120
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,824
WITH ABOUT 100
CAR JACKS,

121
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,994
GET 'ER UP HIGHER
THAN THE BEDS ON
THE PICKUP TRUCKS.

122
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,829
THEN, WE'LL BACK
SEVEN TRUCKS INTO
THE FRONT END,

123
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,664
WE'LL BACK
SIX MORE TRUCKS
INTO THE BACK END.

124
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,133
WE'LL DROP THE BUILDING
RIGHT DOWN, SO THAT SHE
SITS ON THE BEDS.

125
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,902
AND THEN AWAY YOU GO.

126
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:38,304
THESE GUYS IN FRONT JUST STEER
AND THE GUYS IN THE BACK
ARE IN REVERSE.

127
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,306
[laughter]

128
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:43,743
WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA
HAVE TO CO-ORDINATE
THE DRIVERS.

129
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:48,114
YOUR IDEAS... DO THEY
COME TO YOU IN DREAMS?

130
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:51,551
HAROLD, IT'S SO SIMPLE.

131
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,753
YOU GOT THE PICKUPS,
YOU GOT 52 WHEELS.

132
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,289
AND IT'S LIKE A...
IT'S LIKE A...

133
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,291
LIKE A GAME OF
52 PICK UP?

134
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,363
YOU KNOW, A FELLA
WROTE ME A LETTER

135
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,833
COMPLAINING THAT
WE ONLY DO PROJECTS
WITH CHEAP, CRAPPY CARS,

136
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,535
AND THAT'S UNFAIR TO
OUR AFFLUENT VIEWERS

137
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,505
WHO MAY HAVE A LUXURY VEHICLE
THAT THEY'D LOVE TO RECYCLE,

138
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,007
BUT THEY JUST DON'T
GET ANY SUGGESTIONS.

139
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,443
WELL, LET ME MAKE
ONE THING CLEAR.

140
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:23,216
JUST BECAUSE I MAY TAKE A K-CAR
AND TURN IT INTO A ZAMBONI,

141
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:27,687
OR A FORD FAIRLANE
INTO A LAWN TRACTOR,

142
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:32,492
DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU CAN'T DO
THE SAME THING WITH A BEAMER
OR AN AUDI, TOO.

143
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:36,529
DON'T LET MY REALITY
HINDER YOUR IMAGINATION.

144
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:41,634
SO, THIS WEEK WE'RE GOING
TO DO A PROJECT USING
THIS LUXURY VEHICLE

145
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:44,904
FULLY EQUIPED WITH ALL
THE BELLS AND WHISTLES.

146
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,873
RIGHT HERE ON "HANDYMAN CORNER."

147
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,475
[crash, bang!]

148
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,844
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS BUILD
SOMETHING WITH THIS VEHICLE

149
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:54,747
THAT EVERY LUXURY CAR OWNER
ONLY DREAMS ABOUT...

150
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,383
A BACKHOE.

151
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,385
OR IN THIS CASE, A FRONT HOE.

152
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,354
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
YOU BETTER LISTEN UP.

153
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,389
'CAUSE I KNOW A LOT OF YOU
RICH PEOPLE JUST HIRE SOMEBODY

154
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:06,259
WHEN YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
THAT'S DIFFICULT OR CREATIVE.

155
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,732
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS REMOVE
THE CROSSPIECE THINGEE...
THE DOOHICKEY.

156
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:16,836
THE THING THERE THAT STOPS
THE LADDER FROM DOING
THE SPLITS.

157
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,739
NOW, YOU COULD TAKE
THE RIVETS OUT OF THERE,

158
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,441
BUT HEY, TO AFFLUENT PEOPLE...

159
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,942
TIME IS MONEY.

160
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,911
[whoosh]

161
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,979
[bang]

162
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:29,115
[whoosh]

163
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,417
[bang, crash]

164
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:32,885
ALL RIGHT, THERE WE GO.

165
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:35,521
NOW, THOSE LEGS ARE FREE
TO OPEN AND CLOSE,

166
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,757
BUT WE NEED A WAY
TO KEEP THEM OPEN.

167
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:40,560
IN MY EXPERIENCE, THERE ARE ONLY
TWO THINGS THAT KEEP LEGS OPEN -

168
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,629
CHILDBIRTH AND A THIGHMASTER.

169
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,765
YOU RICH GUYS MAY KNOW
OF ANOTHER THING.

170
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,867
BUT, I'M GOING WITH
THE THIGHMASTER.

171
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,707
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S OUR BASIC
BACKHOE UNIT PUT TOGETHER.

172
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,710
AND I'VE ATTACHED 'ER
TO THE FRONT BUMPER.

173
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,379
NOW COMES THE FUN PART.

174
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,782
WE NEED THIS THING
TO MOVE IN THREE WAYS.

175
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,084
FIRST OF ALL, WE NEED
THIS SECTION TO MOVE

176
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:08,688
SO THAT THE SCOOP CAN GO
RIGHT UP AND OVER THE DIRT.

177
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:14,727
NEXT, WE NEED THE LADDER ITSELF
TO SQUEEZE TOGETHER AGAINST
THE THIGHMASTER.

178
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,463
SO, THAT THE SCOOP CAN
ACTUALLY PICK UP THE DIRT.

179
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:20,933
AND LASTLY, WE NEED THE SCOOP
TO BE ABLE TO PIVOT.

180
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,870
SO WE CAN LOAD
AND UNLOAD THE DIRT.

181
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,938
ALL RIGHT, TO DO ALL THAT...

182
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:29,675
I'M GONNA USE THESE CLOTHESLINES
AND CLOTHESLINE PULLEYS.

183
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,244
I GOT THESE FREE
FROM A NEIGHBOUR

184
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,813
WHO NOW HAS TO BUY A DRYER.

185
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:38,317
I'LL HOOK ALL THIS UP, AND THEN,
WE CAN GET TO THAT FUN PART
I SPOKE OF EARLIER.

186
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,341
NOW, YOU FIND OUT WHY
WE HAD TO USE A LUXURY CAR.

187
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:08,114
BECAUSE MANY OF THE HIGH-END
POWER OPERATED OPTIONS ARE GOING
TO BE USED TO RUN OUR BACKHOE.

188
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,650
FOR EXAMPLE, THE HEIGHT AND
THE DRAG OF THE UNIT

189
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,218
ARE GOING TO BE RUN
BY THESE CABLES

190
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,153
WHICH ARE ATTACHED
TO THE POWER WINDOWS,

191
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:17,456
AND THE ANGLE OF THE BUCKET IS
CONTROLLED BY THE POWER SUNROOF.

192
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:20,259
HERE, LET ME SHOW YOU.

193
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:25,565
LET'S SAY YOU GOTTA GET
A PILE OF DIRT OFF
YOUR FRONT LAWN

194
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,934
BECAUSE YOUR IN-LAWS
ARE COMING OVER

195
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,769
AND THEY ALWAYS STEAL YOUR DIRT.

196
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,972
[laughter]

197
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:37,043
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
WE JUST WANNA LOWER THE HEIGHT
WITH THE HEIGHT CONTROL,

198
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,745
OR IN THIS CASE,
THE DRIVER'S WINDOW.

199
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:50,056
NEXT, WE JUST GOTTA DROP
THE BUCKET WITH OUR
SUNROOF CONTROL.

200
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:56,095
THEN, WE JUST PULL IT IN
WITH THE DRAG CONTROL OR
THE PASSENGER WINDOW.

201
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,966
AND THEN, JUST RAISE 'ER UP.

202
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:03,369
AND THEN, WE CAN TAKE 'ER OVER
TO WHERE WE WANT TO DUMP 'ER.

203
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:09,275
[applause and laughter]

204
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,177
IS THAT LUXURY, OR WHAT?

205
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,179
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

206
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,314
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

207
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,350
OH YEAH, WE GOTTA DUMP
THE DIRT, TOO.

208
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:23,356
WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS
THE CADILLAC OF BACKHOES.

209
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:26,492
NO ACTUALLY, IT'S
THE BACKHOE'S OF CADILLACS.

210
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,568
YOU KNOW, GETTIN' OLDER
HAS ITS UPSIDE.

211
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:39,405
AND I DON'T MEAN JUST
THE SENIORS' DISCOUNT
ON THE LAXATIVES.

212
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:44,477
FOR EXAMPLE, OLD CODGERS CAN SAY
ANYTHING THEY WANT, TO ANYBODY.

213
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,013
THEY CAN TELL A PERSON THE TRUTH
RIGHT TO THEIR FACE

214
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,115
AND THAT PERSON WILL SMILE
AND PAT THEM ON THE BACK

215
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:53,452
AND CONGRATULATE THEM ON BEING
SPUNKY AND FULL OF LIFE.

216
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:57,189
WHEN YOU REACH
YOUR GOLDEN YEARS,
YOU CAN STOP LYING.

217
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:01,427
YOU'VE SPENT YOUR WHOLE LIFE
PUTTING A GOOD SPIN ON THINGS

218
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,130
BECAUSE YOU WANTED PEOPLE
TO CUT YOU SOME SLACK.

219
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,699
SO YOU LIED.

220
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,467
FIRST TO YOUR PARENTS,

221
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,169
THEN TO YOUR WIFE,

222
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,104
THEN TO YOUR KIDS.

223
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:15,074
AND THEY KINDA GOT USED TO IT.

224
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:19,278
YOUR PARENTS DIDN'T REALLY WANT
TO KNOW WHAT YOU WERE DOING
'TIL ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT.

225
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:24,383
YOUR WIFE DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW
HOW SLIMMING THAT DRESS
REALLY IS.

226
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:30,723
AND YOUR KIDS DON'T WANT TO HEAR
HOW MUCH MONEY IS REALLY IN
THEIR COLLEGE FUND.

227
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:33,759
SO, YOU JUST BE PATIENT, EH?

228
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,795
JUST HANG ON FOR A FEW YEARS

229
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,197
AND THEN, YOU CAN START
TELLING THE TRUTH, HUH.

230
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,599
PEOPLE WILL THINK YOU'RE
CHARMING OR AMUSING

231
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:43,903
OR MAYBE, THEY'LL JUST
BLAME YOUR MEDICATION.

232
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:48,107
NOW, WHEN ACTUALLY YOU START
BEING HONEST IS YOUR DECISION.

233
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:52,144
BY THE WAY, YOU LOOK GREAT.
HAVE YOU LOST WEIGHT?

234
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:54,146
REMEMBER, I'M PULLIN' FOR YA.

235
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,582
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

236
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:00,786
WELL WE DID IT!

237
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:03,422
WE GOT THAT BUILDING
ALL JACKED UP, YES SIR!

238
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,491
HA! HA! HA!

239
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:08,561
WE GOT 'ER TOTALLY JACKED UP
AND IT WAS ROUGH, TOO.

240
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,730
BECAUSE THE ONE CORNER WAS
AWFUL SPONGY, THERE.

241
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,067
THE JACK DIDN'T EVEN CATCH UNTIL
IT BIT INTO THE EAVESTROUGH.

242
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,503
WE ALSO GOT THE BUILDING SITTING
RIGHT DOWN ON THE TRUCKS, THERE.

243
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,739
SEVEN TRUCKS IN THE FRONT END -
SIX TRUCKS IN THE BACK.

244
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:23,476
THEN, OLD MAN SEDGEWICK BROUGHT
HIS GREMLIN IN RIGHT UNDER
THE MIDDLE OF THE UNIT.

245
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,478
WELL, IT WAS A GREMLIN.

246
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,980
IT'S MORE OF A DOLLY
AT THIS POINT.

247
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,316
BUT, SHE'S ALL LOADED ON THERE
AND SHE'S BALANCED.

248
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:31,650
SO, C'MON HAROLD,

249
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,819
LET'S GET THAT
BABY INTO TOWN.
I'M NOT GOING!

250
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,454
I'M NOT DRIVING
NO TRUCK FOR THAT.

251
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,423
FORGET ME, NOOO!!!

252
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,860
UH-UH, UH-UH,
NO WAY JOSE, UH-UH!!

253
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,329
HAROLD,
WE DON'T NEED
DRIVERS, OKAY?

254
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,930
WE NEED SOMEBODY
TO BE IN CHARGE.

255
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,398
SOMEONE TO SUPERVISE.

256
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:47,967
SOMEONE TO YELL
OUT DIRECTIONS.

257
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,136
YOU KNOW, FORWARD, BACKWARD,
RIGHT, LEFT, AND SO ON.

258
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,337
WE NEED A CO-ORDINATOR.

259
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:52,772
WE NEED YOU TO
SUPERVISE, HAROLD.

260
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,307
AAH! YEAH!

261
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:58,911
I SUPPOSE IT WOULDN'T HURT
TO HAVE SOMEBODY INVOLVED
WITH BRAINS, WOULD IT?

262
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,914
YOU DON'T MIND ME
RUNNING THE SHOW,
UNCLE RED?

263
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,917
BECAUSE USUALLY YOU RESERVE
THESE CUSHY MANAGEMENT JOBS
FOR YOURSELF.

264
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:08,988
YOU KNOW, HAROLD,
I JUST DON'T LIKE
THE HEIGHTS.

265
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:12,992
[laughter]

266
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,327
...HEIGHTS?
YEAH, WELL...

267
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,196
IT'S ONLY A ONE
STORY BUILDING,

268
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,465
BUT SITTING UP THERE,
STRADDLING THE PEAK,

269
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,866
HANGING ON TO
THE CHIMNEY,

270
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,202
THAT'S A JOB FOR
A YOUNGER MAN.

271
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:31,243
THIS LITTLE CONTEST THAT WE HAVE
AT THE LODGE TO GET THE FIRST
TROUT OF THE SEASON.

272
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:35,881
I BELIEVE THE SIZE OF THE LURE
REALLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE.

273
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,751
AND, YOU KNOW, ONE CAST
IS WORTH THREE...

274
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,353
I GOT SOMETHING THERE
ON MY VERY FIRST CAST.

275
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:42,855
WHAT HAVE I GOT THERE?
WHAT HAVE I GOT THERE?

276
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,557
IT LOOKS LIKE A GOOD ONE.

277
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:45,925
WHAT IS IT?

278
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,194
OH, IT'S A PAIR OF BOXER SHORTS.

279
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,663
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE HARD TO CATCH
BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTTOM FEEDERS.

280
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,298
[laughter]

281
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,233
OH, BY GOLLY!

282
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:59,438
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
HI BILL, YEAH.

283
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:02,575
YOU'RE NOT USING MY ROD, NO!

284
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:05,211
THERE'S ALL KINDS OF WAYS
TO FISH, BILL.

285
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:08,814
FIGURE OUT ANOTHER WAY TO GO
FISHING, IT'S YOUR PROBLEM.

286
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,817
HUH? WHAT?
WHAT'S HE DOING?

287
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:15,287
LOOKS LIKE THE MEDICATION
HAS KICKED IN.

288
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:18,157
[laughter]

289
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,758
WHY IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY, THERE

290
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:23,462
AND IT'S SOMETHING TO SIT ON
IF I GET TIRED.

291
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:26,665
I GUESS THIS IS
THE BEAR TECHNIQUE.

292
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:30,736
NOW, FOR A LITTLE LUNCH BREAK.

293
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:32,938
DO YOU WANT ANY OF THIS, BILL?

294
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,708
BILL, YOU WANT ANY...

295
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,110
STILL NO FISH...

296
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,412
I THINK BILL MAY BE HAVING
AN EFFECT ON THAT.

297
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:43,115
WHAT'S GOING ON?

298
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:45,985
OH! OH! OH MY GOSH!!!
OH MY GOSH! OH! OH!!!

299
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,053
NO, NO, NO!!!

300
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,722
YOU GOTTA CATCH IT.

301
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,259
YOU CAN'T JUST
SURROUND IT, BILL.

302
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,194
HE'S GOT 'ER!

303
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:56,362

304
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,796
LOOK OUT, LOOK OUT, LOOK OUT!!!

305
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,498
WHERE IS IT?
WHERE IS IT?
WHERE IS IT?

306
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,333
OH BOY! OH BOY! OH BOY!

307
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:05,237
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

308
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,740
HERE'S WHY IT'S GOOD TO
ALWAYS HAVE A FRIEND AROUND.

309
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,441
THERE WE GO! THERE WE GO!

310
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:10,976
BILL, STAND STILL.

311
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,344
I KNOW WHERE IT IS.

312
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:15,281
STAND STILL!

313
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,516
HERE IT IS.

314
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:18,584
OH, THERE WE GO.

00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,586
ALL RIGHT, BILL,

316
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,121
BILL, BILL, BILL!!!

317
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,689
NO BILL, THAT'S MY GEAR!

318
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,824
NO, NO, BILL!

319
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:28,661
HEY, I BORROWED THAT STUFF!

320
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,663
GET 'EM, BILL, GET 'EM!

321
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,898
BILL, GET 'EM.

322
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,400
BILL, HE'S IN THE CANOE.

323
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,568
HE'S BEHIND YOU,
BEHIND YOU, BEHIND YOU.

324
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:38,938
BILL, TURN AROUND.

325
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,073
TURN AROUND, TURN AROUND!

326
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:44,243
NO, NO, HE'S BEHIND YOU.

327
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,378
HE'S IN THE CANOE.
HE'S IN THE CANOE.

328
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:47,780
THERE HE IS, THERE HE IS!
THERE YOU GO, THERE YOU GO!

329
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,215
NOT THE AXE, BILL.
NOT THE AXE, NOT THE AXE!

330
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:52,484
READ MY LIPS: NOT THE AXE!!!

331
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,086
OH NO, OH NO!

332
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,188
OH NO! OH NO!
OH BOY! OH BOY!

333
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:59,758
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA,
GO OUT INTO THE DEEP STUFF.

334
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,193
BILL? BILL?

335
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:04,430
DO YOU FEEL WET AT ALL?

336
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,165
IT'S A GOOD NEWS,
BAD NEWS THING.

337
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,800
YOU KNOW WHAT?

338
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,835
I STILL SENSE AN OPPORTUNITY.

339
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,937
AAH! THERE WE GO!

340
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,772
BY GOLLY, THAT BIG LURE
SURE IS PAYING OFF.

341
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,541
C'MON, C'MON, C'MON IN.

342
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,077
HEY! HEY! HEY!
HEY, LOOK, BILL!

343
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,079
I GOT US THE TROUT, BUDDY!!!

344
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,880
[amazing!]

345
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,554
"IF IT AIN'T BROKE,
YOU'RE NOT TRYING."

346
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:31,523
JOINING ME TODAY
IS EDGAR MONTROSE.

347
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:35,027
EDGAR IS THE ONLY
DYNAMITE EXPERT IN
THE POSSUM LAKE AREA.

348
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:37,563
THE ONLY ONE
LIVING, ANYWAY.

349
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:40,032
NO SIR, RED,
THEY CERTAINLY DON'T.

350
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,601
[laughter]

351
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:46,472
IF YOU CALL
THAT LIVING.

352
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:49,908
SO, WHAT HAVE YOU
GOT TODAY, EDGAR?

353
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:53,879
OH, A VERY LOUD
RINGING IN MY HEAD.

354
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:58,484
KINDA LIKE THAT...
...ONLY LOUDER.

355
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:03,055
ALL RIGHT, I GUESS
THE UMBRELLA IS WHAT
YOU WANT ME TO FIX.

356
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:06,759
WELL, THAT'S TOTALLED, EDGAR.

357
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:10,295
WHAT I COULD DO, IS MAYBE
FIX THE HOLES IN YOUR HAT.

358
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,364
I'M HOT?

359
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,333
YOUR HAT, EDGAR.

360
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,101
YOU CAN FIX HOLES
IN YOUR CLOTHING,
BY THE WAY,

361
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,736
IF YOU'RE NOT GOOD WITH
A NEEDLE AND THREAD.

362
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,705
YOU CAN USE
THE FASHION DESIGNER'S
SECRET WEAPON:

363
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:23,242
DUCT TAPE.

364
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,710
WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE UMBRELLA?

365
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,480
OH... UH,
THE UMBRELLA
GOT WRECKED

366
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,451
WHEN I PULLED
FLINTY MCCLINTOCK'S
TRACTOR OUT OF THE MUD.

367
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,887
APPARENTLY, HE THOUGHT
I HAD A TRUCK WITH
A WINCH.

368
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,257
I DON'T HAVE
A TRUCK WITH
A WINCH.

369
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:41,226
I HAVE DYNAMITE!

370
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,863
SO, I BLEW HER UP
OUT OF THERE!!!

371
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,598
YOU KNOW, RED.

372
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:49,268
THESE NEW TRACTORS THAT
THEY'RE BUILDING NOWADAYS,

373
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:53,205
THEY'RE VERY BRITTLE.

374
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,706
ALL RIGHT, EDGAR.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

375
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,008
I'M GONNA RETHINK HERE.

376
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,043
I'M NOT GONNA PLUG UP
THE HOLES IN YOUR HAT.

377
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:01,246
I THINK YOUR BRAIN
NEEDS ALL THE AIR
IT CAN GET.

378
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:09,955
[applause]

379
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:17,596
[laughter and cheering]

380
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,799
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU?

381
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,068
SHINGLES.

382
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:26,605
[loud laughter]

383
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,874
THE GOOD NEWS IS...

384
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:32,444
THAT OLD BUILDING
IS OUT OF THE WAY,
FOREVER.

385
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,747
BEAUTIFUL, OLD,
PIONEER LOG CABIN.

386
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:38,117
[pfffht!]

387
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,885
THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE GOING TO
SAVE HISTORY,

388
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,520
NOT MAKE IT.

389
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,856
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DIDN'T CALL
THE PHONE COMPANY.

390
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,757
WHEN YOU MOVE A BUILDING
DOWN THE STREET

391
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,526
WITH TELEPHONE POLES
ON BOTH SIDES,

392
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:50,162
YOU GOTTA CALL
THE PHONE COMPANY.

393
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,964
WHAT THEY DO IS THEY
TAKE DOWN THE LINES

394
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,233
AND ONCE YOU PASS,
THEY PUT THE LINES
BACK UP!!!

395
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:57,903
WELL, WE DID HALF THEIR
JOB FOR THEM, DIDN'T WE?

396
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,172
WELL, I'M GLAD THAT
I HAD THAT CHIMNEY
TO HOLD ON TO.

397
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:04,710
I GOT TELEPHONE LINE
BURNS ON MY THIGHS!!

398
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,111
AND THAT'S ANOTHER
THING TOO...

399
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,846
YOU'VE GOTTA CALL
THE POWER COMPANY.

400
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,348
WHAT ABOUT
THE POWER LINES?

401
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,116
YEAH, THAT WAS BAD.

402
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:13,352
YEAH, THAT WAS BAD.
THAT WAS REAL BAD!!!

403
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:16,688
I SUGGEST THAT YOU SHOULD
PRE-MEASURE ALL BRIDGES
ALONG THE ROUTE

404
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,190
TO MAKE SURE THAT
THEY'RE WIDE ENOUGH.

405
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,491
YEAH, YEAH.

406
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,326
ESPECIALLY THAT
COVERED BRIDGE.

407
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,828
[laughter]

408
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,030
YEAH, THAT POOR OLD
COVERED BRIDGE...

409
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,700
THAT THE HISTORCAL 
SOCIETY WORKED SO
HARD TO PRESERVE.

410
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,204
WELL, IT'S NOT
A COVERED BRIDGE
ANYMORE, IS IT?

411
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:37,309
JUST A BRIDGE, NOW.
SURROUNDED BY LUMBER.
YEAH, YEAH.

412
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,612
YOU SHOULD'VE
PRE-MEASURED.
I KNOW THAT.

413
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,481
OR, AT LEAST,
SLOWED DOWN.

414
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,383
[loud laughter]

415
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,919
C'MON HAROLD,
WE COULDN'T
SLOW DOWN.

416
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,755
ONCE THE POWER LINES
SET FIRE TO THE CABIN,

417
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:53,525
WE HAD TO, PRETTY MUCH,
HAUL IT, YOU KNOW.

418
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:57,095
THE IRONY THERE
WAS THAT WE COULDN'T
CALL IN AN EMERGENCY

419
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:58,931
'CAUSE THE PHONE
LINES WERE DOWN.

420
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:03,602
SO, WE HAD TO
DRIVE THE FIRE TO
THE FIRE STATION.

421
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:07,506
YEAH, POOR OLD FIRE STATION...

422
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:12,511
THAT THE HISTORICAL
SOCIETY WORKED SO
HARD TO PRESERVE.

423
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,913
THE ONE THAT HAD STOOD
THERE FOR 100 YEARS,

424
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:17,916
TAKING EVERYTHING
THAT MOTHER NATURE
COULD THROW AT HER.

425
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,352
NOT INCLUDING
A FLAMING LOG CABIN

426
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,755
TRAVELLING AT TWICE
THE SPEED LIMIT.

427
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:26,858
BUT, IN FAIRNESS,
FOR A FIRE STATION,

428
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:29,795
IT WAS PRETTY DARN FLAMMABLE.

429
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:33,665
AND YOU KNOW,
FULL MARKS TO
BUZZ SHERWOOD

430
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,934
WHO REALIZED THAT
THE FIRETRUCKS

431
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:39,304
WERE ACTUALLY
TRAPPED INSIDE
THE BURNING STATION.

432
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,440
SO, HE FILLED UP HIS
WATER BOMBER PLANE

433
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,042
AND DROPPED WATER
RIGHT ON THE FIRE.

434
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,111
WELL, HE TRIED.
HE TRIED.

435
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:49,147
HE GOT THE BAPTIST CHURCH.

436
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,850
POOR OLD BAPTIST CHURCH...

437
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,954
THAT THE HISTORICAL
SOCIETY WORKED SO
HARD TO PRESERVE.

438
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:59,324
THAT CHURCH DIDN'T
HAVE A PRAYER.

439
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,093
DID YOU LEARN ANYTHING?

440
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,429
ANY LITTLE THING
FROM ALL THIS?

441
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,931
WELL, I DID HAROLD, YEAH.

442
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,566
I THINK LEARNED
WHAT IRONIC MEANS.

443
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:09,935
I NEVER REALLY
GOT IT BEFORE,

444
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,803
BUT I THINK
I'M THERE, NOW.

445
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,839
[sound of the squeal]

446
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,108
SQUEAL OF THE POSSUM -
IT'S MEETING TIME.

447
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,543
YOU GO AHEAD, HAROLD.
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

448
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,112
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

449
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,680
WHAT IS IT?

450
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,149
A LITTLE BIT
OF HISTORY.

451
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:27,286
EASY NOW, EASY.

452
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:35,527
[applause]

453
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:40,465
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT
HOME AFTER THE MEETING.

454
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:44,036
I KNOW I WAS SUPPOSED TO CALL,
BUT I GOT A DANDY EXCUSE.

455
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,038
AND TO THE REST OF YA,

00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,053

463
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:14,066
JUST A QUICK ANNOUNCEMENT FROM
THE HISTORICAL SOCIETY.

464
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:17,002
DUE TO THE RECENT LOSS
OF HISTORICAL BUILDINGS
IN THE AREA,

465
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:22,407
IT SEEMS THE HISTORICAL SOCIETY
WILL NO LONGER BE DECLARING
BUILDINGS AS HISTORICAL SITES.

466
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:25,977
THEY'LL BE LABELLING THEM
AS TARGETS, AS OPPOSED
TO BUILDINGS.
