124
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:40,786
AND SO, I THOUGHT I'D JUST,

125
00:03:40,786 --> 00:03:42,254
YOU KNOW, KIND OF DO HIM

126
00:03:42,254 --> 00:03:43,022
A FAVOR AND CHANGE

00:03:47,326 --> 00:03:49,628
SO...

131
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:53,399
THE SCREWDRIVER'S NOT BIG

00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,534
ENOUGH.

THE SCREWDRIVERS ON THESE, I

134
00:03:56,802 --> 00:03:57,737
SHOULD SAY, THE SCREWS ON THESE

135
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:02,141
ARE WAY BACK IN THERE.

136

BUT, YOU KNOW...

137
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,745
WHO THE HECK DESIGNS

138
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:06,645
THESE THINGS?

139
00:04:06,645 --> 00:04:08,714
PROBABLY MECHANICS.

140
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,252
I CAN'T SEE IF THE SCREW IS A

141
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:18,224
FLATHEAD OR A ROBERTSON, OR A--

142
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,392
I CAN'T SEE WHAT KIND IT IS.

143
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:24,864
SO--OKAY.

144
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,632
WE'LL JUST TRY ANOTHER METHOD

145
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:27,366
HERE.

146
00:04:27,366 --> 00:04:28,667
I THINK THIS WILL JUST POP

147
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:32,538
RIGHT OFF HERE.

148
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:35,541
GET THAT IN THERE.

149
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:39,778
TAKE THE OTHER SIDE.

150
00:04:39,778 --> 00:04:42,548
UH...

151
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:46,518
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

152
00:04:46,518 --> 00:04:47,887
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO NOW IS,

153
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,154
IT'S THE WIRING I GUESS,

154
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:50,856
THAT'S CATCHING THAT IN THERE,

155
00:04:50,856 --> 00:04:52,491
AND WE'LL JUST USE THE SPECIAL

156
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:58,030
TOOL THAT I KEEP IN MY CLOSET.

157
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,064
SOME METAL OR SOMETHING CAUGHT

158
00:04:59,064 --> 00:05:02,301
BACK IN HERE.

159
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:04,703
OH, THAT'S--ALL RIGHT.

160
00:05:04,703 --> 00:05:07,606
I THINK, YOU KNOW, THE WIRING IS

161
00:05:07,606 --> 00:05:09,341
THE THING THAT'S MESSING

162
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:10,909
THIS UP, SO WE'LL JUST CLIP

163
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:11,677
THAT OUT OF THERE.

164
00:05:11,677 --> 00:05:12,811
YOU KNOW, THESE NEW CARS, THEY

165
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:13,812
GOT SO MUCH WIRING IN THEM.

166
00:05:13,812 --> 00:05:14,913
IT'S JUST MORE THINGS

167
00:05:14,913 --> 00:05:18,517
TO GO WRONG.

168
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:19,418
YOU KNOW, WHAT'S JUST OCCURRING

169
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:20,386
TO ME, I THINK ONE OF THESE

170
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:21,553
MODERN CARS, THIS IS THE TYPE

171
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:23,989
WHERE THE HOOD--THE HEADLIGHT

172
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:25,891
COMES OUT FROM BEHIND,

173
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:26,625
FROM OUT IN THE BACK,

174
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:27,459
AND SO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS,

175
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:32,131
YOU NEED TO OPEN THE HOOD.

176
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:35,868
[buzzing]

177
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,836
UH, I'LL TRY THIS.

178
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:42,574
crash!

179
00:05:42,574 --> 00:05:44,977
NO, THAT'S NOT IT.

180
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,179
ALL RIGHT.

181
00:05:50,215 --> 00:05:51,417
OKAY, NOW I THINK THINGS ARE

182
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,385
GONNA GO A LITTLE BETTER NOW.

183
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:57,122
FOR GOD'S SAKE.

184
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,796
UH, OH--SAFETY.

185
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:08,967
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

186
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:11,003
OKAY.

187
00:06:15,707 --> 00:06:17,309
ALL RIGHT, YEAH, I CAN GET HER

188
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:19,611
OUT FROM THE INSIDE HERE,

189
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:21,480
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO TAKE A FEW

190
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,650
THINGS OUT TO GET OUT OF THERE.

191
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,056
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK MORE WITH A

192
00:06:31,056 --> 00:06:32,858
LOT MORE FUN AND THE REST OF

193
00:06:32,858 --> 00:06:33,525
THE STORY ABOUT MY

194
00:06:33,525 --> 00:06:34,826
WIND-POWERED BOAT.

195
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:35,928
>> OH, GREAT, SO NOW YOU GOT

196
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,229
LIKE A CHOICE OF FUN

197
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:39,198
OR THE STORY.

198
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,749
>> "IT IS SUMMER.

199
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:58,684
YOU RUN DOWN THE BEACH

200
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,652
AND EMBRACE THE SURF.

201
00:07:00,652 --> 00:07:02,421
THE OCEAN RESPONDS WITH A HUGE

202
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,557
WAVE THAT REMOVES YOUR TRUNKS.

203
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:06,491
THE FIRST BRUSH WITH

204
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:08,293
SUMMER LOVE.

205
00:07:08,293 --> 00:07:12,264
AND CRAYFISH."

206
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:14,633
NOW, AS I WAS SAYING BEFORE I

207
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:16,368
WAS ELECTRONICALLY ASSAULTED, WE

208
00:07:16,368 --> 00:07:18,036
WANTED TO BUILD A SOLAR-POWERED

209
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:20,372
BOAT, SO WE GOT A FEW OF THEM

210
00:07:20,372 --> 00:07:22,007
SOLAR PANELS, AND WE WENT AROUND

211
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:23,709
THE LODGE HERE AND COLLECTED UP

212
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,277
ALL THE OLD CAR BATTERIES--

213
00:07:25,277 --> 00:07:27,479
IT CAME TO ABOUT 95--

214
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:28,680
AND WE HOOKED THEM UP TO ONE

215
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,315
OF THEM LITTLE ELECTRIC

216
00:07:30,315 --> 00:07:31,616
TROLLING MOTORS.

217
00:07:31,616 --> 00:07:33,018
AND THEN WE WENT OUT, A BUNCH OF

218
00:07:33,018 --> 00:07:34,453
US, FOR SOME NIGHT FISHING,

219
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:35,921
BUT IT DIDN'T WORK OUT ALL

220
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:36,755
THAT WELL.

221
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:37,956
AND WE SUDDENLY REALIZED THAT--

222
00:07:37,956 --> 00:07:39,257
AND I GUESS THE SOLAR THING HAS

223
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:40,358
GOT, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING TO DO

224
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:41,893
WITH THE SUN.

225
00:07:41,893 --> 00:07:43,795
SO AS WE WERE PADDLING BACK,

226
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:45,097
WE THOUGHT MAYBE WE SHOULD

227
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:45,797
SWITCH OVER TO

228
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:48,033
A TIDAL-POWERED BOAT.

229
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:49,000
BUT THEN THE LAKE IS REALLY NOT

230
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,969
ALL THAT BIG, AND BESIDES, NONE

231
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:52,304
OF US HAS REALLY ANY IDEA WHAT

232
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:54,606
TIDAL-POWER IS.

233
00:07:54,606 --> 00:07:55,707
SO WE DECIDED TO GO WITH

234
00:07:55,707 --> 00:07:56,575
WIND POWER.

235
00:07:56,575 --> 00:07:57,542
IT SEEMED LIKE A HECK OF A GOOD

236
00:07:57,542 --> 00:07:58,643
IDEA, AND THE FIRST STEP WOULD

237
00:07:58,643 --> 00:08:01,046
BE TO GET OURSELVES A WINDMILL.

238
00:08:01,046 --> 00:08:03,582
>> A WINDMILL?

239
00:08:03,582 --> 00:08:04,916
I MEAN, YOU JUST WANT, LIKE,

240
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:05,750
A WIND-POWERED BOAT.

241
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,854
YOU GET A WINDMILL?

242
00:08:08,854 --> 00:08:09,654
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GET, LIKE,

243
00:08:09,654 --> 00:08:10,355
A SAIL.

244
00:08:10,355 --> 00:08:12,557
YOU KNOW, LIKE, A SAIL?

245
00:08:12,557 --> 00:08:13,225
>> NO, WE HAD TO HAVE

246
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:14,226
A WINDMILL, BECAUSE A BOAT

247
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:15,360
HAS TO HAVE A MOTOR--

248
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,829
FOR A MAN, OKAY, HAROLD?

249
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:19,731
I MEAN, SAILING IS FOR WIMPS.

250
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:20,599
YOU KNOW, A BUNCH OF GUYS IN

251
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:21,633
THOSE LITTLE WHITE SHORTS AND

252
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:23,268
SNEAKERS, YOU KNOW.

253
00:08:23,268 --> 00:08:24,002
>> I DON'T KNOW, UNCLE RED,

254
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:24,836
THAT'S NOT A VERY NICE THING TO

255
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:25,737
SAY, TO CLASSIFY PEOPLE

256
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:26,738
LIKE THAT.

257
00:08:26,738 --> 00:08:28,240
I'M SURE THERE'S SOME VERY NICE

258
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,642
PEOPLE WHO HAVE SAILBOATS.

259
00:08:30,642 --> 00:08:32,344
>> NAME THREE, HAROLD.

260
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:34,412
>> UM, SIR FRANCIS DRAKE,

261
00:08:34,412 --> 00:08:36,548
MAGELLAN, AND MY HERO,

262
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:37,515
TED TURNER, THE MAN

263
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:38,917
WHO COLORIZED AMERICA.

264
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:42,320
TED, THIS ONE'S FOR YOU.

265
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,456
[laughs]

266
00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:46,091
>> WHAT ABOUT MY BOAT STORY?

267
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:47,459
>> WE SAILED AWAY FROM IT.

268
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,427
[laughs]

269
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:54,432
>> YEAH, AND I'LL TELL YOU

270
00:08:54,432 --> 00:08:55,734
SOMETHING, HAP.

271
00:08:55,734 --> 00:08:57,002
FISHING HAS GOT TO BE THE MOST

272
00:08:57,002 --> 00:08:59,237
RELAXING THING THERE IS.

273
00:08:59,237 --> 00:09:01,072
>> YEAH, THAT'S FOR SURE.

274
00:09:01,072 --> 00:09:02,073
I USED TO DO A LOT OF FISHING

275
00:09:02,073 --> 00:09:04,009
WHEN I WORKED ON THE RANCH.

276
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:06,645
JUST ON THE LINES, YOU KNOW.

277
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:08,713
>> WHAT RANCH WAS THAT?

278
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:10,882
>> OH, THE CIRCLE "K" BAR,

279
00:09:10,882 --> 00:09:15,220
DOUBLE "R," INVERTED AMPERSAND.

280
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,321
>> AROUND HERE, HAP?

281
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:17,522
>> NO, NO.

282
00:09:17,522 --> 00:09:20,291
NO, THAT WAS KENYA.

283
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,526
THAT WAS YEARS AGO.

284
00:09:21,526 --> 00:09:22,861
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE OWNER'S

285
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:23,728
NAME NOW.

286
00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:24,529
BIG FELLA.

287
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:26,131
AUSTRALIAN.

288
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,931
NO.

289
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:27,699
AUSTRIAN.

290
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:30,702
OR AFGHANI OR SOMETHING.

291
00:09:30,702 --> 00:09:31,703
>> WHAT KIND OF CATTLES YOU HAVE

292
00:09:31,703 --> 00:09:32,370
DOWN THERE?

293
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,037
DID YOU REMEMBER?

294
00:09:33,037 --> 00:09:34,372
>> NO CATTLE.

295
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:36,307
COWS ARE CONSIDERED HOLY ANIMALS

296
00:09:36,307 --> 00:09:37,809
OVER IN KENYA.

297
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:39,144
>> NO, NO, I THINK THAT'S INDIA,

298
00:09:39,144 --> 00:09:41,379
HAP.

299
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:43,581
>> OH, KENYA WAS THE SAME WAY

300
00:09:43,581 --> 00:09:44,883
FOR A WHILE.

301
00:09:44,883 --> 00:09:45,850
A BIG INDIAN POPULATION

302
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:46,551
OVER THERE.

303
00:09:46,551 --> 00:09:48,286
ANYWAY, WE RAISED TIGERS.

304
00:09:48,286 --> 00:09:50,321
THAT WAS TOUGH WORK.

305
00:09:50,321 --> 00:09:51,322
>> YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT YOU

306
00:09:51,322 --> 00:09:53,424
LOOKED AFTER A HERD OF TIGERS?

307
00:09:53,424 --> 00:09:54,425
>> IT WASN'T A BIG HERD,

308
00:09:54,425 --> 00:09:55,894
200 OR 300 HEAD,

309
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:57,428
BUT IT WAS A HANDFUL,

310
00:09:57,428 --> 00:09:58,830
ROPING AND BRANDING THEM.

311
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,998
IT WAS VIOLENT WORK.

312
00:09:59,998 --> 00:10:01,466
RODEOS WERE NOTHING BUT

313
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:04,002
A BLOODBATH.

314
00:10:04,002 --> 00:10:05,069
>> WELL, HAP, THAT SOUNDS LIKE A

315
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:06,271
TERRIBLE WAY TO MAKE A LIVING.

316
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:07,405
>> YEAH, I HAD THE WORST OF IT.

317
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:08,406
I HAD TO TRAIN TIGERS FOR

318
00:10:08,406 --> 00:10:10,975
THE CIRCUS.

319
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:12,177
I HAD TO TEACH THEM TO TAKE

320
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:13,077
A MAN'S HEAD IN THEIR MOUTH

321
00:10:13,077 --> 00:10:13,878
WITHOUT BITING IT OFF.

322
00:10:13,878 --> 00:10:14,812
YOU KNOW, I COVERED MY FACE

323
00:10:14,812 --> 00:10:15,813
WITH HORSERADISH.

324
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:17,782
WORKED LIKE A CHARM.

325
00:10:17,782 --> 00:10:18,950
ALTHOUGH MY EYES WERE BLOODSHOT

326
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,520
FOR TWO YEARS.

327
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,524
>> HAP, WHERE EXACTLY WAS THIS

328
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:28,726
RANCH IN KENYA?

329
00:10:28,726 --> 00:10:30,828
>> OH, IT'S ALL CLOSED DOWN NOW.

330
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:32,463
YOU KNOW, SAME OLD STORY.

331
00:10:32,463 --> 00:10:34,232
RANCHERS AGAINST THE FARMERS,

332
00:10:34,232 --> 00:10:35,600
YOU KNOW.

333
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,069
THAT'S A NYLON FARM NOW.

334
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:39,570
>> OH, NO, NO, NO, NYLON DOESN'T

335
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,738
COME FROM A FARM.

336
00:10:40,738 --> 00:10:44,309
IT'S FROM OIL.

337
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:45,410
>> WELL, YOU COULD BE RIGHT.

338
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,679
MAYBE I'M THINKING NACRON

339
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,747
OR ORLON OR SOMETHING.

340
00:10:49,747 --> 00:10:50,615

BUT AGAIN, IF YOU ASK ME,

473
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,918
I THINK IT'S A PRETTY WUSSY

HE CAN'T DO IT.

[laughs]

481
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,663

492
00:15:56,453 --> 00:15:59,189
IS HE DEAD OR SOMETHING?

493
00:16:14,905 --> 00:16:16,206
>> BILL'S ACTUALLY TRYING TO

494
00:16:16,206 --> 00:16:17,240
HELP ME OUT WITH A PROBLEM.

495
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,644
I'D LOST MY WATCH, AND HE

HELP AS BILL USUALLY IS,

499

00:16:27,284 --> 00:16:29,987
HEADPHONES AND THE BATTERY PACK.

501
00:16:29,987 --> 00:16:31,288
AND HE FLIPS HER ON.

502
00:16:31,288 --> 00:16:33,123
AND IT FINDS PIECES OF METAL

503

IN THE GROUND.

504
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,694

511
00:16:45,402 --> 00:16:47,671
ATTENTION, WOULDN'T IT?

512
00:16:47,671 --> 00:16:48,739
THE THING I HAVE AGAINST THE

513
00:16:48,739 --> 00:16:50,741
METAL DETECTORS IS THAT PEOPLE

514
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:51,942
WALK AROUND WITH THEM, THEY LOOK

515
00:16:51,942 --> 00:16:54,378
A LITTLE ON THE DORKY SIDE,

516
00:16:54,378 --> 00:16:55,178
AND I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO BE

517
00:16:55,178 --> 00:16:57,047
WITH BILL, BUT I WANTED TO GET

518
00:16:57,047 --> 00:17:00,817
MY WATCH BACK TOO.

519
00:17:00,817 --> 00:17:02,119
OH, I'M GETTING A LITTLE

520
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:03,386
IMPATIENT WITH HIM.

521
00:17:03,386 --> 00:17:05,489
I GOT TO ADMIT.

522
00:17:05,489 --> 00:17:06,356
I REALLY DIDN'T FEEL LIKE

523
00:17:06,356 --> 00:17:07,791
SPENDING THE REST OF THE SUMMER

524
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,359
DOING THIS.

525
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,527
BUT HE WAS GETTING SOMETHING.

526
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:11,695
HE WAS GETTING CLOSE.

527
00:17:11,695 --> 00:17:12,362
YOU COULD HEAR IT.

528
00:17:12,362 --> 00:17:13,530
YOU COULD HEAR IT.

529
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:16,766
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

530
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:17,868
YEAH.

531
00:17:17,868 --> 00:17:18,535
UH-HUH.

532
00:17:18,535 --> 00:17:20,504
I'D AGREE WITH THAT, BILL.

533
00:17:20,504 --> 00:17:23,073
ANYWAY, BACK AT IT AGAIN.

534
00:17:23,073 --> 00:17:23,907
HE'S STARTING TO PICK UP

535
00:17:23,907 --> 00:17:24,674
A LITTLE SOMETHING,

536
00:17:24,674 --> 00:17:27,277
SO HE SAYS ANYWAY.

537
00:17:27,277 --> 00:17:28,411
IT SEEMS TO BE AROUND ME

538
00:17:28,411 --> 00:17:31,181
SOMEWHERE.

539
00:17:31,181 --> 00:17:33,383
OH, OH, OH, OH--

540
00:17:33,383 --> 00:17:38,955
IT WAS HIS BATTERY BELT.

541
00:17:38,955 --> 00:17:41,258
SO WHAT HE DOES IS, HE TELLS ME

542
00:17:41,258 --> 00:17:42,592
TO AND GET AN EXTENSION CORD.

543
00:17:42,592 --> 00:17:44,094
HE UNPLUGS THE BATTERY PACK.

544
00:17:44,094 --> 00:17:45,896
HE'S GONNA DROP THAT.

545
00:17:45,896 --> 00:17:46,796
AND WE'RE GONNA RUN IT RIGHT OFF

546
00:17:46,796 --> 00:17:50,033
OF THE NORMAL LODGE CURRENT,

547
00:17:50,033 --> 00:17:52,903
WHICH IS I THINK 98 VOLTS

548
00:17:52,903 --> 00:17:54,004
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

549
00:17:54,004 --> 00:17:55,672
BUT IT'S WAY TOO MUCH FOR A--

550
00:17:55,672 --> 00:17:57,007
OH, AND THEN SHE JUST STARTED

551
00:17:57,007 --> 00:17:59,175
TO HUM, YOU KNOW, AND IT JUST

552
00:17:59,175 --> 00:18:00,243
DIDN'T SOUND RIGHT TO ME,

553
00:18:00,243 --> 00:18:02,812
BUT HE FELT IT WOULD WORK.

554
00:18:02,812 --> 00:18:04,281
I HAD A METAL FLY IN MY PANTS.

555
00:18:04,281 --> 00:18:05,181
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED THERE.

556
00:18:05,181 --> 00:18:05,849
BUT IT WAS GETTING BILL

557
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:07,884
OUT OF CONTROL.

558
00:18:07,884 --> 00:18:09,185
AND SUDDENLY IT WAS--

559
00:18:09,185 --> 00:18:13,623
BILL, BILL, BILL, BILL, BILL.

560
00:18:13,623 --> 00:18:14,557
STILL QUITE A BIT OF METAL LEFT

561
00:18:14,557 --> 00:18:16,559
IN THE VAN, SO I SAVED HIS LIFE

562
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,962
RIGHT THERE.

563
00:18:18,962 --> 00:18:21,331
>> OH.

564
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:22,098
>> HE'S ALL RIGHT.

565
00:18:22,098 --> 00:18:24,734
HE'S ALL RIGHT.

566
00:18:24,734 --> 00:18:25,869
SO I FIGURED HE GOT HIMSELF

567
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:27,103
BACK TOGETHER AGAIN.

568
00:18:27,103 --> 00:18:28,171
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO, YOU KNOW,

569
00:18:28,171 --> 00:18:29,372
TO PLUG IT BACK IN.

570
00:18:29,372 --> 00:18:33,076
I DIDN'T SEE HIM--SORRY, BILL.

571
00:18:33,076 --> 00:18:33,910
SO THIS TIME HE DECIDES HE'S

572
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,679
GONNA--HE'S JUST GONNA HOLD

573
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,047
HIS GROUND.

574
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:37,814
HE'S GONNA DIG IN.

575
00:18:37,814 --> 00:18:38,515
IT'S TOUGH.

576
00:18:38,515 --> 00:18:39,382
IT'S TOUGH FOR AN OLDER

577
00:18:39,382 --> 00:18:40,250
GENTLEMAN, AND HE'S GONNA DIG

578
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,352
RIGHT IN, AND NOW STUFF STARTS

579
00:18:42,352 --> 00:18:45,055
MOVING ACROSS THE...

580
00:18:45,055 --> 00:18:46,456
WELL, HE HAD A LOT OF METAL

581
00:18:46,456 --> 00:18:48,892
THINGS AROUND THE LODGE.

582
00:18:48,892 --> 00:18:49,893
WELL, MAYBE THINGS THAT WE DON'T

583
00:18:49,893 --> 00:18:51,061
HAVE A SPECIFIC USE FOR TODAY,

584
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:52,362
YOU KNOW, OR NECESSARILY

585
00:18:52,362 --> 00:18:53,596
TOMORROW.

586
00:18:53,596 --> 00:18:57,100
BUT CERTAINLY WITHIN THE NEXT

587
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,468
200 TO 300 YEARS, WE'D HAVE

588
00:18:58,468 --> 00:19:01,304
USE FOR ALL OF THIS STUFF.

589
00:19:01,304 --> 00:19:02,939
INTERESTING THING HERE WAS THAT,

590
00:19:02,939 --> 00:19:04,274
YOU KNOW, I'D FORGOTTEN WHERE

591
00:19:04,274 --> 00:19:07,143
THAT BIKE WAS.

592
00:19:07,143 --> 00:19:08,244
AND THAT MAY AFFECT TRAFFIC,

593
00:19:08,244 --> 00:19:09,746
THAT ONE.

594
00:19:09,746 --> 00:19:11,681
BUT WHAT HE WAS DOING WAS REALLY

595
00:19:11,681 --> 00:19:12,816
COLLECTING ALL OF THE STUFF INTO

596
00:19:12,816 --> 00:19:14,984
ONE AREA, AND THAT WAS DONE.

597
00:19:14,984 --> 00:19:17,587
THAT WAS ENOUGH.

598
00:19:17,587 --> 00:19:19,222
AND HE'S OKAY.

599
00:19:19,222 --> 00:19:21,257
AND THEN THE GREAT NEWS IS,

600
00:19:21,257 --> 00:19:22,458
SON OF A GUN, HE ACTUALLY FOUND

601
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,893
MY WATCH.

602
00:19:23,893 --> 00:19:25,829
SO, YOU KNOW, JUST WHEN YOU

603
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:28,865
LEAST EXPECT IT.

604
00:19:28,865 --> 00:19:29,666
SO, COME ON, BILL.

605
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,968
LUNCHTIME.

606
00:19:35,338 --> 00:19:36,139
THIS WAS MORE OF A CHALLENGE

607
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:39,676
THAN FINDING THE WATCH, I THINK.

608
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:40,710
IT KIND OF LOOKS A BIT LIKE

609

00:21:56,545 --> 00:21:58,447
SO I WANTED TO TELL YOU HOW THE

681
00:21:58,447 --> 00:22:01,150
WIND-POWERED BOAT TURNED OUT.

682
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,051
WE MANAGED TO FIND AN OLD

683
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:03,686
WINDMILL AT A MINIATURE GOLF

684
00:22:03,686 --> 00:22:04,787
COURSE THAT WAS GOING OUT OF

685
00:22:04,787 --> 00:22:06,389
BUSINESS, AND IT HAS A NICE

686
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:07,723
BIG BLADE ON HERE THERE

687
00:22:07,723 --> 00:22:08,391
AND A SMOOTH AXLE,

688
00:22:08,391 --> 00:22:09,659
AND ONCE WE DUMPED THE 400

689
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:10,726
GOLF BALLS OUT OF HER,

690
00:22:10,726 --> 00:22:12,795
SHE WASN'T THAT HARD TO CARRY.

691
00:22:12,795 --> 00:22:14,030
SO WE BOLTED IT RIGHT ONTO

692
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,032
THE BOAT, AND THEN WE PATCHED

693
00:22:16,032 --> 00:22:17,333
ALL THE SCREW HOLES AND THE

694
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,702
MISTAKES, AND THEN WE RAN

695
00:22:19,702 --> 00:22:20,736
A CHAIN FROM THE WINDMILL

696
00:22:20,736 --> 00:22:22,238
DOWN TO THE GENERATOR

697
00:22:22,238 --> 00:22:23,339
WE RIPPED OUT OF MY STUDEBAKER,

698
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:25,274
AND THEN WE HAD THAT GENERATOR

699
00:22:25,274 --> 00:22:27,510
HOOKED UP TO AN ELECTROPLATE

700
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,145
THAT WENT RIGHT INTO A BIG TANK

701
00:22:29,145 --> 00:22:30,813
OF DISTILLED WATER,

702
00:22:30,813 --> 00:22:31,881
AND SO THAT WOULD GET

703
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:32,681
HYDROGEN THERE.

704
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:33,482
AND THEN WE HAD A SECOND

705
00:22:33,482 --> 00:22:35,384
WINDMILL TO BLOW THE HYDROGEN

706
00:22:35,384 --> 00:22:37,753
INTO THE OUTBOARD MOTOR,

707
00:22:37,753 --> 00:22:38,654
BUT THEN WITH ALL THAT STUFF IN

708
00:22:38,654 --> 00:22:40,322
THERE WAS REALLY JUST ROOM FOR

709
00:22:40,322 --> 00:22:41,257
ABOUT ONE PERSON, BUT, HEY,

710
00:22:41,257 --> 00:22:42,291
IT WAS A PROTOTYPE.

711
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,026
YOU KNOW, AND NONE OF THE GUYS

712
00:22:44,026 --> 00:22:45,094
HAD MUCH FAITH IN THE

713
00:22:45,094 --> 00:22:45,828
MECHANISM WORK, BUT IT

714
00:22:45,828 --> 00:22:48,764
SURPRISED EVERYONE BY SINKING.

715
00:22:48,764 --> 00:22:50,432
ANYWAY, I GUESS THE WIND-POWERED

716
00:22:50,432 --> 00:22:52,034
BOAT JUST STAYS AS A DREAM FOR

717
00:22:52,034 --> 00:22:53,702
A WHILE, BUT, HEY, IT KILLED OFF

718
00:22:53,702 --> 00:22:55,471
A DAY, SO IT WASN'T ALL BAD.

719
00:22:55,471 --> 00:22:56,906
SO IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING

720
00:22:56,906 --> 00:22:58,140
THE SHOW TONIGHT, I'M GONNA BE

721
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:58,974
COMING STRAIGHT HOME.

722
00:22:58,974 --> 00:23:00,609
IF YOU WANT ME TO WAKE YOU, JUST

723
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:02,278
TIE A RIBBON AROUND THE BEDROOM

724
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:03,946
DOORKNOB.

725
00:23:03,946 --> 00:23:05,681
SO TILL NEXT TIME, ON BEHALF OF

726
00:23:05,681 --> 00:23:06,949
MYSELF AND HAROLD AND THE WHOLE

727
00:23:06,949 --> 00:23:09,051
GANG UP HERE AT THE LODGE,

728
00:23:09,051 --> 00:23:11,353
YOU KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

729
00:23:11,353 --> 00:23:14,323
[applause]
