IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:12,946
HERE'S A MAN WHO'S IN TOUCH
WITH HIS FEMININE SIDE,

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,015
EVERY TIME HE PHONES HIS WIFE,

6
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:16,549
YOUR HOST, MY HERO,

7
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:19,219
UNCLE RED GREEN!

[cheering]

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,624
ALL
RIGHT!

10
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,192
YOU'RE THE MAN!

11
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:28,128
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

12
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,930
WELL, IT'S SPRING TRADING DAY

13
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:32,499
UP AT THE LODGE.

14
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:34,901
WHY CAN'T YOU SPRING CLEAN?

15
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,836
JUST THROW OUT JUNK.

16
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:38,405
WITH SPRING TRADING

17
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:40,206
YOU CAN GET RID OF STUFF

18
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:42,509
YOU'VE HOARDED OVER THE WINTER.

19
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:45,412
THE TRICK IS TO MAKE
THE BEST TRADES.

20
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:48,348
HOW COME EVERYTHING HAS TO BE
A COMPETITION?

21
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:50,817
THERE HAS TO BE
A WINNER AND A LOSER.

22
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,253
YOU CAN'T CHEER
FOR YOUR HOCKEY TEAM!

23
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,055
YOU GOT TO MAKE A POOL.

24
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:58,558
EVERYBODY CHEERS FOR EVERYBODY
THAT WAY -- HA HA.

25
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,027
YOU BUY
THE SPORTS LOTTERY TICKETS.

26
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:03,296
YOU DON'T CARE
WHO WINS THE GAME.

27
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:04,798
IT'S JUST STUPID.

28
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:06,366
YOU LOST
AGAIN, EH?

29
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,435
TWENTY WEEKS IN A ROW.

(Red): HAP TRIES TO CONVINCE US
HE WRESTLED ELEPHANTS,

34
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:32,258
I'LL SCOUR MY WORKBENCH
FOR A SPECIAL KIND OF TAPE,

35
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:34,761
DALTON TALKS ABOUT
THE FACTS OF LIFE,

36
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,262
AND I'M GONNA

37
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,466
FISH SOMETHING OFF THE BOTTOM
OF POSSUM LAKE.

38
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,806
THIS WAS MY WORST TRADE --
I GOT THERE LATE.

39
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:50,276
THE ONLY GUY WITH STUFF LEFT
WAS OLD MAN SEDGWICK.

40
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:53,847
HALF A RAILING,
A BENT HOSE CLAMP,

41
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:56,349
A BUNCH OF VANILLA BEANS,
I HOPE.

42
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:57,851
LOOK AT THIS.

43
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,652
A PICTURE OF A POSSUM.

44
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:03,156
HEY, THIS COULD BE
THE POSSUM LODGE POSSUM.

45
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,592
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
NO, IT COULD BE.

46
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:09,562
THIS PICTURE IS LIKE A PIECE
OF HISTORY TO A COLLECTOR.

47
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,364
IT'S WORTH 70, 80 CENTS.

48
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:14,701
HAROLD, THAT'S AN AERIAL PHOTO
OF POSSUM LAKE.

49
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:17,670
IT'S THE POSSUM --
THAT "X" IS HIS EYE.

50
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:19,806
WOULDN'T THE "X" BE IN THE HEAD?

51
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,774
OK, WELL THEN, WHAT'S THIS "X"?

52
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:24,878
I GUESS THAT'S
OLD MAN SEDGWICK'S SIGNATURE.

53
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,479
TREASURE, IT'S TREASURE!

54
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:29,349
THAT "X" MARKS THE SPOT
OF VALUABLE TREASURE

55
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,317
AT THE BOTTOM OF POSSUM LAKE.

56
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,819
NO, HAROLD, NO.

57
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,821
WE THOUGHT OF THAT -- OH.

58
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:39,826
BUT WHAT COULD OLD MAN SEDGWICK
HAVE HAD OF VALUE 50 YEARS AGO?

59
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,327
MAYBE HIS MIND.

60
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:44,430
DO OTHER LODGE MEMBERS
KNOW ABOUT THIS?

61
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,932
THEY DON'T CARE.

62
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,433
WE'RE TOO BUSY.

63
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,869
WE GOT IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO.

64
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,938
LIKE WHAT SPECIFICALLY?

65
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,774
JUST THINGS, THAT'S ALL,
IMPORTANT THINGS.

66
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,276
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

67
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,777
IT'S THINGS MEN DO.

68
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,979
OVEREATING, SLEEPING,
WATCHING T.V.,

69
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:01,781
DRINKING BEER, FIXING CARS.

70
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,783
PRETTY MUCH COVERS IT, YEAH.

(Red): TO GET READY FOR
"ADVENTURES WITH BILL",

73
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,991
BILL IS BUILDING A DUCK BLIND.

74
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:14,727
THE POINT IS TO BE
TOTALLY INVISIBLE.

75
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:17,363
I THINK HE'S DONE
AN EXCELLENT JOB.

76
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,799
I DON'T THINK I SAW HIM, DID I?

77
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,301
NO, NO.

78
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,902
YOU ALL RIGHT, BILL?

79
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,305
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, AREN'T YOU?

80
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,806
IT'S A DUCK BLIND.

81
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,641
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DUCK.

82
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,842
OH, YOU'RE FINE.

83
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:33,112
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT PORTION
OF THE SHOW.

84
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:36,282
THIS WEEK WE HAVE EXPERTS,
MY UNCLE RED,

85
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,818
AND HIS FRIEND DALTON HUMPHREY.

[applause]

87
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,755
GOT A QUESTION.

88
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,827
OK, FIRST QUESTION
GOES AS FOLLOWS: "DEAR EXPERTS,"

89
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,829
LA LA LA 

90
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,731
"HOW OLD"-- EXCELLENT ONE!

91
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,666
"HOW OLD SHOULD A CHILD BE

92
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,502
"BEFORE YOU EXPLAIN
THE FACTS OF LIFE?"

93
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,340
WELL, THIS REALLY DEPENDS ON
THE MATURITY OF THE CHILD.

94
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,841
SOME ARE READY AT 13.

95
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,876
OTHERS AREN'T READY UNTIL...

96
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,346
HOW OLD
NINETEEN.           ARE YOU?

97
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,847
UNTIL THEY'RE 21.

98
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,350
THIS IS ONE JOB
THAT NO PARENT WANTS.

99
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:14,654
I'M GLAD I WON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN
THE FACTS OF LIFE TO ANYBODY.

100
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:18,291
HOW OLD WAS YOUR DAUGHTER
WHEN YOU TOLD HER?

101
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,026
THAT'S A WIFE'S JOB.

102
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:24,030
THE DAD TELLS THE SON,
WIFE TELLS THE DAUGHTER.

103
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,965
THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS.

104
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,134
YOUR DAD TALKED TO YOU, RIGHT?

105
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:31,304
NO, HE GAVE ME A BOOK
BY MICKEY SPILLANE

106
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,306
CALLED "KISS ME DEADLY".

107
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:36,175
AND SAID "THIS IS WHAT
MARRIED PEOPLE DO."

108
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:40,013
I THOUGHT HE MEANT SHOOT
EACH OTHER AND HAVE CAR CHASES.

109
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,081
THAT'S WHAT HIS RELATIVES DID.

110
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:43,783
MR. HUMPHREY,
HOW OLD

111
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,253
WAS YOUR DAUGHTER
WHEN YOUR WIFE TOLD HER

112
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,755
ABOUT THE FACTS--

113
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:53,259
ABOUT THE...
UH, YOU KNOW, THE... THE...

114
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,761
ABOUT IT?

115
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:56,362
HOW OLD?

116
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:59,265
SHE HASN'T YET.

117
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:02,669
TABITHA'S ONLY 20.

118
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,304
THERE'S NO RUSH.

119
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,440
BUT SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND,
DOESN'T SHE?

120
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,941
SO?

121
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,778
YOU KNOW, IT'S PUPPY LOVE, RED.

122
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:13,646
TOTALLY INNOCENT.

123
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:17,784
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
THEY EVEN KISS YET.

124
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,788
I JUST THOUGHT 'CAUSE
THEY'D MOVED IN TOGETHER.

125
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:26,559
WELL, YEAH, BUT THAT, THAT,
DOESN'T M-M-MEAN ANYTHING.

126
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,828
HE SLEEPS ON THE COUCH.

127
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,797
HA HA HA HA.

128
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,465
[audience laughing]

129
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:35,835
HER MOTHER WILL TALK TO HER
WHEN THE TIME'S RIGHT!

130
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:39,305
WELL, I HOPE SHE CAN GET HER
ATTENTION IN THE DELIVERY ROOM.

131
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:45,745
[audience laughing]

132
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,315
 I'VE ASKED LOTS OF MEN 

133
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,451
 WHAT'S THE THING
THEY LIKE MOST 

134
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:55,154
 HUNTING OR FISHING
OR PEANUT BUTTER ON TOAST 

135
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:58,891
 THE MOST POPULAR ANSWER
FROM EACH TIME I'VE ASKED 

136
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,729
 IS WHATEVER I'M DOING,
I LIKE TO GO FAST 

137
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,864
 HE LIKES TO GO FAST 

138
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:08,568
 DRIVING A CAR
OR RIDING A BIKE 

139
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:12,271
 EATING MY DINNER
OR TAKING A HIKE 

140
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:15,975
 SPEED IS THE THRILL
THAT MAKES ALL MEN GLAD 

141
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,910
 EXCEPT WHEN
WE'VE FALLEN OFF THE ROOF 

142
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,912
 IN WHICH CASE
WE'D LIKE GRAVITY TO 

143
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:24,984
 JUST EASE OFF
ON THE THROTTLE A TAD 

144
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:29,355
MAYBE I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH LUCK
AT THIS YEAR'S SPRING TRADING,

145
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:32,291
BUT, THE TRUE HANDYMAN
MAKES HIS OWN LUCK,

146
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,127
AND OFTEN HIS OWN BANDAGES.

147
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:38,464
ALL RIGHT, I COULDN'T GET RID
OF THESE TWO CLOTHES DRYERS,

148
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:39,966
AND THIS BICYCLE.

149
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:42,335
SO YOU COULD SAY
I'M STUCK WITH THEM.

150
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,738
WELL THEN, WHY NOT TURN THEM
INTO SOMETHING USEFUL?

151
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:49,242
I THINK IT WAS SHAKESPEARE
WHO SAID...

152
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:53,079
YOU CAN'T MAKE A SILK EAR
OUT OF A SOW'S PURSE.

153
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,748
MAYBE THAT WAS
SIR FRANCIS BACON.

154
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,284
DIDN'T HE ALSO SAY
YOU CAN MAKE

155
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:02,488
AN ELECTRIC LAWN ROLLER
OUT OF JUST ABOUT ANYTHING.

156
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,490
AND IT'S DEAD EASY.

157
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:14,434
FIRST, YOU GOT TO
CHOP 'EM DOWN A LITTLE BIT...

158
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,036
SO THE DRUM WILL SIT
RIGHT THERE ON THE GROUND.

159
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,006
THIS IS HOW THEY LOOK
WHEN THEY'RE CHANNELLED

160
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,842
WITH CHROME LIFTERS
AND THE HURST SHIFTER.

161
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,844
A COUPLE OF LAPS ON YOUR YARD

162
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:28,114
AND YOUR GRASS WILL BE
SMOOTH ENOUGH TO GOLF ON.

163
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,615
ONCE I GET THAT DONE,

164
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:32,151
I NEED SOMETHING TO
CONNECT THE TWO.

165
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,886
I'M GONNA USE THIS BIKE.

166
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,788
KIND OF STICK HER IN HERE.

167
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:39,826
I COULD ATTACH IT WITH
SPOT WELDING OR STOVE BOLTS,

168
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:44,130
OR, HOW ABOUT THE HANDYMAN'S
SECRET WEAPON, DUCT TAPE.

169
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,037
I GOT THE BICYCLE MOUNTED
ONTO MY DRYERS.

170
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:52,872
HERE'S A WORD OF CAUTION.

171
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,574
GET A COMFORTABLE SEAT.

172
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,844
WE'RE LOOKING AT A MAJOR WEDGIE
IN MY FUTURE.

173
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,846
THEY CALL THEM BANANA SEATS

174
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:02,915
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO
PEEL YOU OFF OF THEM.

175
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,885
ANOTHER THING YOU WANT TO
THINK ABOUT IS

176
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,687
THAT THE DRYERS' EXHAUST

177
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:10,756
GIVES OFF A LOT OF
FABRIC SOFTENER FUMES.

178
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,125
YOU DON'T WANT TO BREATHE THAT.

179
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:16,028
SO I'LL MOUNT
A COUPLE OF EXHAUST PIPES

180
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,698
USING SOME DUCT WORK
FROM THE DRYER.

181
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:23,269
I JUST NEED SOMETHING TO
TAPE THE DUCT WORK TOGETHER.

182
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,770
UH.

183
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,607
SOME KIND OF TAPE
FOR DUCT WORK.

184
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,779
HERE WE GO.

185
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,281
ADHESIVE TAPE.

186
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,782
THAT WILL BE PERFECT.

187
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,784
I'LL MOUNT THESE ON HERE.

188
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,286
LOOK AT THAT.

189
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,722
NOTHING SAYS POWER
LIKE DUAL EXHAUSTS.

190
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,725
JUST SCREAMS "EAT MY LINT."

191
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,226
THERE WE GO.

192
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,128
I'LL BE ROLLING THE LAWN,

193
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,831
SO I GOT HER SET ON
PERMANENT PRESS.

194
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,733
WHEN I GET TO THE GARDEN,

195
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,836
I'LL FLIP HER OVER TO
THE DELICATE CYCLE.

196
00:08:56,903 --> 00:09:00,239
INSIDE THE DRYER,
YOU'VE GOT AIR BLOWING AROUND.

197
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,874
YOU GOT A LINT FILTER.

198
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,243
THROW SOME GRASS SEED IN THERE.

199
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,545
POP THAT BABY IN,

200
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:08,381
AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY BE
ROLLING AND SEEDING

201
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:09,549
AT THE SAME TIME.

202
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,784
I GOT HER HARD-WIRED
INTO THE HOUSE

203
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,453
WITH PLENTY OF CORD
FOR MANOEUVRABILITY.

204
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,255
SHE'S A BEAUTY, ISN'T SHE?

205
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:19,625
ALSO MAKE A DANDY STEAMROLLER,
EVEN A LEAF PRESS.

206
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,862
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME...

207
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,932
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

208
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:30,102
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I GOT TO GET ROLLING.

209
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:34,941
OH, OH, OH, OH, OH!

210
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,343
WELL, SHE ROLLED.

211
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,847
FIND OUT ABOUT RANGER GORD'S
IMAGINARY FRIEND.

212
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,155
THIS PHOTO WITH THE "X"

213
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:52,425
HAS EVERYBODY CONVINCED
THERE'S SOMETHING VALUABLE

214
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,360
AT THE BOTTOM OF POSSUM LAKE.

215
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,362
YOU SAID THEY
WEREN'T INTERESTED.

216
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,965
THEY WEREN'T UNTIL
THEY HEARD YOU WERE.

217
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,967
THAT COMPETITION THING
KICKS IN.

218
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:04,170
IT'S NOT THAT THEY THINK
THEY'LL FIND TREASURE.

219
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:07,907
THEY CAN'T STAND THE THOUGHT
THAT SOMEBODY ELSE MIGHT.

220
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,475
THEY HAD
THEIR CHANCE.

221
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,977
THEY WEREN'T
INTERESTED.

222
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,446
THEY DON'T WANT TO
LOOK LIKE IDIOTS.

223
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:14,947
REALLY

224
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,449
WOW.

225
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:17,950
NOW THERE'S A COMPETITION

226
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,519
TO SEE WHO CAN DIVE
THE DEEPEST.

227
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:23,089
I SWAM THERE AND
MY FEET TOUCHED BOTTOM.

228
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,890
NO, THAT WASN'T THE BOTTOM.

229
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,225
THAT WAS JUST STUFF.

230
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,827
OH, AW.

231
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:31,664
OK, FINE -- I'LL LOWER
MY VIDEO CAMERA DOWN THERE.

232
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,432
NO, I TRIED THAT, HAROLD.

233
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:36,235
ALL I GOT WAS DARKNESS.

234
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,071
OK, MAYBE YOU JUST HAD
THE WATERPROOF CASE

235
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,573
ON BACKWARDS.

236
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,808
WATERPROOF CASE --
WHERE'S THAT?

237
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:50,349
FOR ALL THE FOREST'S BEAUTY,
IT CAN BE ONE OF

238
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,185
THE MOST DANGEROUS PLACES
ON EARTH.

239
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:56,055
THEN I'M THINKING
WE JUST HOLD EVERYTHING,

240
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:59,992
AND YOU GIVE PEOPLE SOME RULES
ABOUT BEING IN THE FOREST.

241
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:03,763
SOME OF YOU FOLKS MAY WANT TO
JOT A FEW OF THESE DOWN.

242
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,865
THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE RULE

243
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,768
THAT WILL SAVE YOUR LIFE
IN THE FOREST.

244
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,436
NEVER COME OUT ALONE.

245
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,772
ALWAYS HAVE A BUDDY WITH YOU.

246
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,774
IN CASE SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS.

247
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,442
YOUR BUDDY WILL HELP YOU,

248
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,611
OR YOU'LL HAVE
SOMEBODY TO BLAME.

249
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,112
[laughing]

250
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,681
NO, I'M SERIOUS.

251
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:26,018
I'M THINKING SOME OF THE VIEWERS
WILL BE SAYING, "THIS IS IRONIC.

252
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:29,088
"RANGER GORD CAN'T EVEN TAKE
HIS OWN ADVICE."

253
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,723
YOU DON'T HAVE A BUDDY.

254
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,059
I SEE WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

255
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,727
AND, IN FACT, I DO.

256
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,997
COME OVER HERE,
I'LL SHOW YOU MY BUDDY.

257
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,599
RIGHT OVER THERE
ON THE HORIZON.

258
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,868
THE PORT ASBESTOS LOOK-OUT.

259
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,370
THAT'S MY BUDDY.

260
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,871
THAT'S RANGER VINCE.

261
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,707
EVERY NIGHT FOR 12 YEARS,

262
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:51,243
RANGER VINCE AND I HAVE BEEN
TURNING ON LIGHTS.

263
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,245
I'LL TURN ON MY LIGHTS.

264
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,247
HE TURNS ON HIS.

265
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:59,318
TWO RANGERS SAYING "HEY, BUDDY,
I'VE NEVER MET YA,

266
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,253
"BUT I'M THERE FOR YA."

267
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:07,159
I'VE NEVER MET RANGER VINCE,
BUT, I FEEL I KNOW HIM.

268
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,661
HE'S MY BUDDY.

269
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,531
UH, UM, THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU.

270
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:15,267
RANGER VINCE,
HE'S ACTUALLY NOT,

271
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,436
HE'S NOT ACTUALLY IN THERE.

272
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,773
HE LEFT THAT TOWER
12, MAYBE 13 YEARS AGO.

273
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,274
THE LONELINESS --

274
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:23,576
HE WASN'T LIKE YOU.

275
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:26,212
HE COULDN'T TAKE IT
AND HE-- THAT'S--

276
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,214
THAT'S A RADIO TRANSMITTER.

277
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,217
EVERY NIGHT I SEE HIM
TURN ON HIS LIGHTS.

278
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:34,720
FAIR ENOUGH, BUT THAT WOULD BE
A REMOTE CONTROL UNIT.

279
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,656
THEY CLICK THE LIGHTS ON
FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE

280
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,292
SO THE PLANES WON'T SMACK
INTO THE TOWER

281
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:41,927
AS MUCH AS THEY USED TO.

282
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,797
VINCE IS GONE, HE'S TOAST,
HE'S IN THE WIND.

283
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,766
HE'S GONE, HE'S OUT OF THERE.

284
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:49,735
THERE'S NO VINCE OVER THERE
AS FAR AS I KNOW.

285
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,237
VINCE!

286
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,205
NO, NO, WASTE OF TIME.

287
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,075
I'VE BEEN ALONE FOR 12 YEARS.

288
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,576
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

289
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,078
[sobbing]

290
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,247
YOU'RE DOING REALLY WELL.

291
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:03,249
SOMEBODY PLEASE HUG ME.

292
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,751
[sobbing]

293
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:08,120
NO, NO, LET'S NOT.

294
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,756
HEY, I KNOW, I KNOW.

295
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,259
GO HUG MY BUDDY, HAROLD.

296
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:14,760
[sobbing]

297
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,328
SORRY, HAROLD.

298
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,669
YOU'RE IN THE SOUP THIS TIME,
AREN'T YOU?

299
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:27,206
YOU AGREED TO MEET HER
AT A CERTAIN TIME AND PLACE

300
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,707
AND YOU FORGOT?!

301
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:31,177
YOU REMEMBERED
AN HOUR AFTER THE FACT.

302
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:34,213
BY THEN YOU WERE OVER
THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN

303
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,215
HALFWAY THROUGH A HAMBURGER.

304
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:39,718
SHE'S STOMPING AROUND
KNEE-HIGH IN THE SNOW,

305
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:42,721
AND YOU'RE IN DEEP SLEET,
BUDDY.

306
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,723
HERE'S WHAT YOU DO.

307
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,725
GIVE YOURSELF A FLAT TIRE.

308
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,227
POKE IT.
SLASH IT.

309
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,229
WHATEVER.
SHOOT IT.

310
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:53,632
IF YOU'VE GOT
AN UNUSED SPARE TIRE,

311
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,734
FLATTEN THAT AS WELL.

312
00:13:55,801 --> 00:14:01,073
THIS MAKES YOUR SITUATION
MORE MISERABLE THAN HERS.

313
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,643
AND THAT GIVES HER
ALL THE POWER TO BE FORGIVING,

314
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,745
WHICH GETS YOU OFF THE HOOK.

315
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,647
BY THE TIME YOU GET HOME,

316
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:11,250
YOU'LL BE THE ONE
GETTING SYMPATHY.

317
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:14,253
SURE, YOU'LL HAVE TO GET TOWED
TO THE GARAGE.

318
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,754
WAIT -- THAT'S FUN.

319
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,756
DON'T TELL HER THAT.

320
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:20,125
RIGHT.

321
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,696
UNCLE RED,

322
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:25,197
LOOK AT THIS.

323
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:28,267
THIS PICTURE IS DATED 1943.

324
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:31,804
GUESS WHAT OLD MAN SEDGWICK
WAS DOING IN 1943.

325
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,472
AVOIDING WORLD
WAR II?

326
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,242
NO, NO, NO,
HE WAS TOO OLD TO SERVE.

327
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:37,743
HE WAS WORKING

328
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,245
ON THE RAILROAD.

329
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,714
SO I FIGURE I'LL CHECK OUT

330
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,550
NEWSPAPERS FROM 1943,
CHECK THE HEADLINES.

331
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,419
SOMETHING LIKE
"RAILWAY PAYROLL VANISHES."

332
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:50,222
"TREASURE TRAIN TOPPLES
INTO LAKE".

333
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,757
OOO.

334
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:55,361
WE GOT NEWSPAPERS
IN OUR MATTRESSES YOU CAN USE.

335
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:56,862
NO, BUT, THANK YOU.

336
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,665
I'LL GO DOWN TO
THE LIBRARY IN TOWN.

337
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,700
THERE'S NO LIBRARY IN TOWN.

338
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:05,404
ACROSS FROM THE GREAT HALL,
THAT YELLOW BUILDING.

339
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,906
THAT'S A LIBRARY?

340
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,407
YES, IT'S A LIBRARY.

341
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,776
WHY ARE YOU DRESSED LIKE THIS?

342
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,746
WE'RE GOING
SCUBA DIVING FOR THE TREASURE.

343
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,414
NOBODY HAS RUBBER CLOTHING,

344
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:18,751
AT LEAST NOT THAT THEY'D USE
FOR SCUBA DIVING.

345
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:21,020
SO NOW WE'VE GOT
A COMPETITION

346
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,690
TO SEE WHO CAN MAKE THE MOST
WATERPROOF WET SUIT.

347
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,525
THAT'S A SNOWMOBILE SUIT.

348
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,194
YOU CAN'T WEAR THAT
INTO POSSUM LAKE.

349
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,696
I DO EVERY WINTER.

350
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:34,199
[audience laughing]

351
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,169
RANGER GORD AT
FIRE WATCH-TOWER 13

352
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:41,273
REMINDING YOU
NEVER EVER TRY TO FEED A BEAR,

353
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,042
NEVER TEASE A BEAR,

354
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,712
AND NEVER EVER
TRY TO DANCE WITH A BEAR.

355
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,280
TRUST ME.

356
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:55,754
(Red): AS I EXPLAINED EARLIER,
BILL BUILT THE DUCK BLIND

357
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,958
BECAUSE HE'D GOTTEN STUFF
IN THE SPRING TRADING.

358
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:01,093
HE'D GOTTEN SOME OPTICAL STUFF.

359
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,963
SOME LITTLE BINOCULARS
WHICH HE LENT TO ME.

360
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,031
LOOK AT THE UNIT HE HAD.

361
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:09,068
WELL, DON'T LOOK AT
THE SUN, BILL.

362
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,569
THERE'S A BIRD!

363
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,071
OH!

364
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,239
BY GOLLY, AND THEY'RE HEAVY.

365
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,741
YOU HIT ME, BILL.

366
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,242
YOU HIT ME.

367
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,744
SHH.

368
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,245
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

369
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,747
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE.

370
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,182
OH, OH!

371
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:24,683
HOW'S THAT FEEL?

372
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,685
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?

373
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,187
GIMME THOSE, BILL.

374
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:29,688
UH-OH.

OH MY GOSH.

377
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:35,027
WELL, THERE'S ONE LESS BIRD.

378
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,196
OW, OW!

379
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:38,697
HEY, THOSE ARE MINE.

380
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,899
YOU GAVE ME THOSE, BILL.

381
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,701
GET SOMETHING ELSE.

382
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,203
NOT MY PROBLEM.

383
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:45,838
HE'S GOT A CAMERA.

384
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:48,707
YOU GOT NO LENS IN THAT CAMERA.

385
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:51,010
YOU GOTTA PUT A LENS
IN THAT THING.

386
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,212
YOU HAVEN'T
GOT A LENS, HAVE YA?

387
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:54,713
OH YES, YOU DO.

388
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,449
OH MY GOSH, LOOK AT THAT.

00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,951
HOLY MACKEREL.

00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,452
THAT'S A BEAUTY.

391
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,156
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE
THE TELEPHOTO SHOTS WITH THAT.

392
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,691
BE CAREFUL WITH THAT.

393
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,659
OH, OH.

394
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,729
YOU'RE DANGEROUS --
GIMME THAT, GIMME THAT.

395
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,264
I'LL GET RID OF THAT.

396
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,332
HOW'S THAT FEEL?

397
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,867
GET RID OF IT.

00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,368
[bird

399
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,737
THERE GOES ANOTHER ONE.

400
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:21,273
WHERE'S ALL THE BIRDS, BILL?

401
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,208
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.

402
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:24,843
WHERE DID THEY GO?

403
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,012
YOU LOOK THAT WAY.

404
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,181
I'LL LOOK THIS WAY.

405
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,784
NO BIRDS.

406
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,753
WELL, NOW WE GET INTO
WHOSE FAULT IT IS.

407
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,422
I DON'T WANNA BLAME--

408
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:39,425
I'M NOT GOING...
I KNOW IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

409
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:42,895
I'M NOT SAYING THAT...
NECESSARILY...

410
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:44,863
OK, I MIGHT HAVE IMPLIED--

411
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,365
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,040
WHAT THE HECK IS--

415
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:58,010
OH, FOR GOSH SAKES,

416
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,212
I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE.

417
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,214
[bird squawking]

418
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,216

419
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:05,717
OH.

420

HE'S ON THEIR TRAIL.

00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:12,157
MIGHT BE FOLLOWING
A LITTLE TOO CLOSE THERE, BILL.

422
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:15,794
STAY TUNED FOR
AN AMAZING STORY.

423
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:26,472
THE HOME-MADE WET SUITS
WERE ALL A DISASTER.

424
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:30,275
JUNIOR SINGLETON MADE HIMSELF
AN ELECTRICALLY-HEATED UNIT.

425
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:34,480
HE WAS DOWN THERE AND CAUGHT
THE CROTCH ON A STOVE.

426
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,448
LIT THE WHOLE PLACE UP.

427
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,717
YOU COULD SEE THE WHOLE LAKE.

428
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,286
IT'S LIKE
A JUNK YARD DOWN THERE.

429
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:43,722
WE'VE NOW SWITCHED TO PLAN "B".

430
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,824
THAT'S GOOD,
YEAH, PLAN "B's" GOOD.

MOOSE THOMPSON AND I
HAVE A 100-FOOT SEWER PIPE.

432
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:53,165
WE'LL GET THAT UP ON ITS END,
DROP IT ONTO THE TREASURE.

433
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,334
THEN WE'LL PUMP THE WATER OUT,

434
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,804
CLIMB DOWN AND PICK
THE TREASURE OFF THE BOTTOM.

00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:02,307
WELL, THAT'S SOUNDS, UM... GOOD.

436

DO YOU HAVE A PLAN "C"?

437
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,345
WE DON'T NEED IT.

00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,415
IN THE OLD PAPER
TO GIVE US A CLUE?

THERE'S NOTHING
ABOUT SUNKEN TREASURE.

NO MENTION OF ANYTHING,
NOT EVEN THE WAR.

WELL, HERE I AM
WITH HAP SHAUGHNESSY.

450
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,844
WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO CATCH?

00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,345
PICKEREL, RED.

452
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:41,980
A REAL FIGHTING FISH.

453
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,949
WOULD YOU SAY PICKEREL IS

454
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,852
THE HARDEST FIGHTER
YOU'VE EVER FACED?

455
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,122
THE HARDEST FIGHTING FISH
I'VE FACED.

456
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:54,860
MIND YOU, THEY'RE NOT AS HARD
AS WRESTLING ELEPHANTS.

457
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,361
NO, I GUESS NOT.

458
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,864
BEEN A WHILE SINCE
I'VE DONE THAT.

459
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:02,401
THAT WAS BEFORE THEY BANNED
ELEPHANT WRESTLING.

460
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:05,304
IT WAS A LOT OF FUN
FOR AWHILE THOUGH.

461
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,139
THE PAY WAS GOOD.

462
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,107
BUT WE NEVER GOT THE RESPECT

463
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:12,177
THAT WE SHOULD HAVE GOT
FROM OTHER ATHLETES.

464
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:15,681
THIS IS AFTER THEY MADE US
A DEMONSTRATION SPORT

465
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,816
AT THE 1956 OLYMPICS
IN OSLO.

466
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,318
OSLO, NORWAY?

467
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,087
THAT WOULD BE
THE WINTER OLYMPICS, HAP.

468
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,823
I BELIEVE WRESTLING
IS A SUMMER EVENT.

469
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,226
WRESTLING IS A SUMMER EVENT.

470
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,895
THIS IS ELEPHANT WRESTLING,

MORE EXCITING.

472
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,934
WOW, I'D THINK
THAT WOULD BE VERY TIRING

473
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:39,338
TO BRING DOWN AN ANIMAL
THAT SIZE BY YOURSELF.

474
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,506
LUCKILY, IT WAS A TAG MATCH.

475
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,175
I'D WEAR HIM DOWN.

476
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:47,746
MY PARTNER, WALLY, WOULD
GET HIM TO THE BREAKING POINT.

477
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:50,349
THEN I'D GO IN
FOR THE TAKE-DOWN.

478
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,084
YOU PINNING AN ELEPHANT.

479
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,285
THAT'S GOT TO BE

480
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,188
THE BIGGEST WHOPPER
YOU'VE EVER LAID OUT.

481
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,357
IT'S ALL IN THE TECHNIQUE.

482
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,359
YOU GET HIM OFF BALANCE.

483
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,829
YOU GET UNDER THE TUSK
AND YOU PULL ON THE TRUNK

484
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:06,298
AND YOU PUSH UP,
AND OVER HE GOES.

485
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,799
OR HER, OR THEM.

486
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,568
I'VE SEEN ME DO A COUPLE.

487
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:13,272
YOU'VE GOT TO FIND A NEW
TECHNIQUE FOR THE NEXT MATCH

488
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,641
BECAUSE AN ELEPHANT
NEVER FORGETS.

489
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:19,111
NO, I ENVY THEM THAT.

490
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:22,814
THIS IS A SMALL PIPE WRENCH.

491
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:25,884
THIS IS A MEDIUM PIPE WRENCH.

492
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:30,322
[ WATER SPLASHING ]

493
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:34,793
THIS IS A LOST PIPE WRENCH.

494
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,667
YOU FOUND IT!

495
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,402
YOU FOUND THE TREASURE!

496
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,903
OH, THAT'S EXCELLENT!

497
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,271
OH, LET'S SEE, LET'S SEE.

498
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,206
GET READY FOR IT, HAROLD.

499
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:49,841
GET READY, GET READY.

500
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,843
YOU READY, HAROLD?

501
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,345
HERE WE GO.

502
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,846
HUH?

503
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:57,349
HUH?

504
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,850
THAT'S IT?

505
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:02,654
YEAH, I GUESS IT JUST
SHOWED UP IN THE PHOTO

506
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,423
BECAUSE IT WAS THERE.

507
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:08,960
I GUESS POSSUM LAKE WAS
A LOT CLEARER IN THOSE DAYS.

508
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:10,929
THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE
WORTH MUCH.

509
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,366
WE FOUND IT AND YOU DIDN'T,
SO THAT HAS SOME VALUE.

510
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:15,867
[laughing]

511
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,803
YEAH, OK,
TO A MORON.

512
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:21,807
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,
BUT IT'S NOT FOR SALE.

513
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,809
[laughter and applause]

514
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,811
[squealing]

515
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:27,813
MEETING TIME,
UNCLE RED.

516
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:29,448
AWAY YOU GO, HAROLD.

517
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,550
I'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.

518
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,819
I'LL BE HOME AFTER THE MEETING.

519
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:37,956
I'M LESS CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LAKE

520
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,692
THAN WHAT'S AT
THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.

521
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,260
ONIONS DO THAT TO ME.

522
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,863
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF,
AND HAROLD,

523
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,699
AND THE WHOLE GANG
AT POSSUM LODGE,

524
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,335
YOU KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

525
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:54,673
[applause and cheering]

526
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,541
[possum squeal]

527
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:59,845
(Harold): OK, ALL RISE.

528
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,913
SERIOUSLY, HE'S HERE NOW.

529
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,786
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

530
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:11,256
(Harold): THERE WAS A CAR LEFT
IN POSSUM LAKE.

531
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:17,262


532
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,364


533
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,266


534
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,601


535
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:25,437


536
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,305


537
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:35,881
