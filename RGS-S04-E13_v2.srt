1
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:04,270
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP WE
WERE TAUGHT TO WORK HARD

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,739
AND GO, GO, GO.

3
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:08,241
I DIDN'T TAKE IT TOO
SERIOUSLY BUT A LOT
OF THEM DID.

4
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:11,778
SO NOW WE'RE STUCK
WITH A GENERATION OF
PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD.

5
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:14,381
UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF THEM,
ESPECIALLY THE MEN,

6
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:18,385
AREN'T PUTTING A LOT OF
THOUGHT INTO WHAT THEY'RE
WORKING HARD AT.

7
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:21,121
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
SO MANY STOCKBROKERS.

8
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:24,457
MOST MEN WOULD RATHER
START DRIVING THAN
LOOK AT A MAP.

9
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:26,426
FORGET THE BLUEPRINTS
AND LET'S BUILD.

10
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:27,794
GO, GO, GO.

11
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:29,696
NOT WHERE,
WHERE, WHERE.

12
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,398
IT'S NOT SMART
OR CORRECT,

13
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:34,667
BUT IT'S ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT MAKES
US WHAT WE ARE.

14
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:45,812
[quirky upbeat music]

15
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,484
ON TODAY'S SHOW, I'M
GOING TO TURN A CAR

16
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:53,653
INTO A PORTABLE
DRIVE-IN MOVIE,

17
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:55,488
DALTON HUMPHREY IS
GOING TO SHOW YOU

18
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,690
HOW TO ADD VALUE TO
A PRECIOUS HEIRLOOM,

19
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,726
BILL IS CALLED
OUT AT THE PLATE,

20
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,294
AND HAROLD FINDS
OUT WHAT HAPPENS

21
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:03,463
WHEN YOU TURN YOUR
BACK ON A RELATIVE.

22
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:08,802
AND NOW HERE'S A
MAN WHO'S ALL BARK,

23
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,103
EVEN THOUGH HE'S
OUT OF HIS TREE,

24
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:12,205
MY UNCLE, RED GREEN.

25
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:16,810
[cheers and applause]

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,548
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

27
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,149
AND PLEASE WELCOME
THE GUY WE REFER TO AS

28
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:26,753
FREE TO GOOD HOME, 
MY NEPHEW, HAROLD.

29
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,425
SCARY STUFF.

30
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,993
A BIT OF EXCITEMENT
THIS WEEK AT THE LODGE.

31
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,829
BUSTER HADFIELD AND
HIS WIFE JUST GOT BACK

32
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,764
FROM A TRIP WHERE THEY
DROVE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

33
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:38,998
WOW, REALLY?

34
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:40,633
I JUST THOUGHT THEY
WERE GOING TO GO VISIT
THEIR RELATIVES

35
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:43,903
LIKE A COUPLE HUNDRED
MILES FROM HERE IN
PORT ASBESTOS.

36
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,538
YEAH, WELL, THAT
WAS THE PLAN,

37
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,774
BUT BUSTER HATES TO
PULL OVER AND ASK
FOR DIRECTIONS

38
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,275
WHEN HE GETS LOST.

39
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,312
SO HE DROVE ALL OVER
THE CONTINENT INSTEAD?

40
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,647
WELL, I DON'T
BLAME HIM, HAROLD.

41
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,649
IT'S EMBARRASSING,
YOU KNOW, TO LOOK LIKE

42
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:58,117
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

43
00:01:58,117 --> 00:01:59,886
YOU DON'T WANT
PEOPLE THINKING
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

44
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,956
ESPECIALLY WHEN
THEY'RE RIGHT.

45
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,291
WELL, THE GOOD THING
WAS HE COULD DRIVE
PRETTY MUCH NONSTOP,

46
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,126
BECAUSE WITH HIS
WIFE YELLING AT
HIM LIKE THAT,

47
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:09,796
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT FALLING ASLEEP
AT THE WHEEL.

48
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,231
OH, HIS POOR WIFE.

49
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,066
THAT MAKES FOR A LONG
TIME WHEN YOU'RE SITTING
BESIDE SOMEBODY GOING,

50
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:16,069
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING,
WITHOUT ANY PROOF.

51
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:20,473
YEAH, IT'S LIKE HAVING
YOU AS A PRODUCER/
DIRECTOR.

52
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,842
SO THE ONE TIME THEY
PULLED OVER FOR GAS,
SHE WENT IN,

53
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,777
BOUGHT A CAMERA SO
SHE COULD TAKE PICTURES

54
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,713
THAT THEY COULD USE
AT THE DIVORCE TRIAL.

55
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,381
BUT BY THE TIME
THEY GOT HOME,

56
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:29,816
OF COURSE,
ALL WAS FORGIVEN.

57
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,784
NOW THEY'VE INVITED
A WHOLE BUNCH OF US
TO COME OVER

58
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,152
TO THEIR PLACE TO
SEE THEIR PICTURES.

59
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:35,421
OH... WELL, OKAY.

60
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:37,257
I GOT SO MUCH TO
DO I CAN'T GO.

61
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,058
YOU KNOW, I GOT TO
CLEAN MY GLASSES,

62
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:41,361
FLOSS MY TEETH,
YOU KNOW.

63
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,196
WELL, THAT'S GREAT,
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE
NOT GOING,

64
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,764
I'LL BE ABLE
TO GO.
OH, OKAY.

65
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,233
MAKE SURE YOU GET
DIRECTIONS BEFORE
YOU LEAVE.

66
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:50,803
IT WOULD BE
REALLY HARD TO DO
THE SHOW FROM MEXICO.

67
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:56,042
YOU'RE WATCHING
THE RED GREEN SHOW.

68
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:59,445
ONE MAN'S JUNK IS
ANOTHER MAN'S TREASURE.

69
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:05,685
WELL, IF YOU'RE ASKED
ON A PICNIC AND YOU
CAN'T REFUSE 

70
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:09,255
BE EXTRA CAREFUL IN
THE SANDWICH YOU CHOOSE 

71
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:12,225
HAM IS OKAY UNLESS
IT'S GREEN AND WET 

72
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:16,296
EGG IS DICEY AND
SARDINE IS A THREAT 

73
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:19,699
IF YOU'RE IN DOUBT,
DON'T TAKE A CHANCE 

74
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:23,203
ONLY EAT THE FOOD THAT'S
COVERED WITH THE ANTS 

75
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,039
IF THERE AREN'T ANY ON IT
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT CLUE 

76
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,341
BECAUSE IF THE
BUGS WON'T EAT IT 

77
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:31,444
THEN NEITHER
SHOULD YOU 

78
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,050
TODAY ON MEET YOUR
MEMBER WE'RE TALKING
TO WINSTON ROTHSCHILD

79
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,852
WHO IS C.E.O.,
C.O.O. AND C3-PO

80
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:44,223
OF ROTHSCHILD'S SEWAGE
AND SEPTIC SUCKING
SERVICES.

81
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:46,025
WINSTON, MAYBE YOU
COULD TELL OUR
VIEWERS

82
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:47,727
HOW YOU GOT TO
WHERE YOU ARE,

83
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,861
WHEREVER THAT MIGHT BE.

84
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,096
WELL, YEAH,
THANKS, RED.

85
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:53,099
I'M FROM ABOUT 70 MILES
FROM HERE, A SMALL
LITTLE VILLAGE.

86
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,235
DIDN'T HAVE A NAME, EH,
COULDN'T AFFORD ONE.

87
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:59,672
I GUESS YOUR DAD
WAS IN THE SEWAGE
BUSINESS BEFORE YOU.

88
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,407
NO, NO, NO.

89
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,544
DAD WAS IN THE RAILROAD
THERE FOR MOST OF
HIS LIFE, EH?

90
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:08,915
YOU KNOW, HE SPENT 30
YEARS AS A COAL MAN.

91
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,583
OH, YEAH.

92
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,585
AND THEN HE -- I DON'T
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED,

93
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,954
THREE OR FOUR YEARS LATER
THEY WENT TO DIESEL
ELECTRIC, EH,

94
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:18,691
AND SO HE'D JUST GO
IN TO WORK AND FALL
ASLEEP IN THE BOXCAR.

95
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:21,894
THAT WOULD BE A
FASCINATING JOB,
I WOULD THINK.

96
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:25,999
AND THEN AFTER 30 YEARS
THE RAILROAD FIRED HIM, EH,

97
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:29,469
JUST LIKE THAT,
LIKE HE WAS NOTHING.

98
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,738
I GUESS IT WOULD
BE HARD FOR HIM
TO FIND ANOTHER JOB

99
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,539
THAT HE WAS
KIND OF SUITED FOR.

100
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,074
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT, EH?

101
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:38,978
AND EVEN AFTER
THE $500,000 WRONGFUL
DISMISSAL SETTLEMENT, EH?

102
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,381
HE WAS BITTER.

103
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,149
YEAH, I'LL NEVER
FORGET THAT VERY DAY,

104
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,184
HE COME HOME AND HE
SAID, WINSTON,
THREE THINGS:

105
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:47,387
NUMBER ONE, START
YOUR OWN BUSINESS;

106
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,355
NUMBER TWO, BE
YOUR OWN BOSS;

107
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:52,959
NUMBER THREE, GET OFF
THE COUCH I GOT TO
TAKE A NAP.

108
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,997
WELL, WINSTON,
I'LL TELL YOU,

109
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,932
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE DONE
WELL FOR YOURSELF.

110
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:03,636
I MEAN, AROUND HERE YOUR
NAME IS SYNONYMOUS
WITH SEWAGE.

111
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,207
I TELL YOU, YOU
HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED

112
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,009
FULL BLOWN
TERMINAL BOREDOM

113
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:13,980
UNTIL YOU SIT THROUGH
THOSE HOLIDAY PICTURES
TAKEN BY BUSTER HADFIELD,

114
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,483
OR, AS WE CALL HIM,

115
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,552
THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST.

116
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,888
BUT I'LL TELL YOU,
EVEN IF YOU GOT
GREAT PICTURES

117
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,389
LIKE MY SLIDES,

118
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:27,527
YOU STILL CAN'T GET
PEOPLE TO COME OVER TO
YOUR HOUSE AND LOOK AT THEM.

119
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,862
SO THAT'S WHY THIS
WEEK ON HANDYMAN CORNER,

120
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:32,999
I THOUGHT I WOULD SHOW YOU
HOW TO MAKE A PORTABLE
PROJECTION SYSTEM.

121
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,069
AND I'M NOT JUST
TALKING A BOUT A
SLIDE PROJECTOR ON WHEELS,

122
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,670
I'M TALKING ABOUT THIS.

123
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:44,544
[groaning and grunting]

124
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,246
[crash!]

125
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,885
YOUR VERY OWN DRIVE-AWAY
DRIVE-IN THEATER,

126
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:55,455
BECAUSE DRIVE-INS ARE FUN,
AND THEY'RE ROMANTIC,

127
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,823
ESPECIALLY THE BACKSEAT.

128
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,491
NOW, YOUR GUESTS ARE
GOING TO SIT IN HERE,

129
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:59,859
JUST LIKE THEY DO
AT A DRIVE-IN.

130
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,628
BUT WITH OUR UNIT THE
SCREEN IS MUCH MORE
INTERACTIVE,

131
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,697
BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE GOING
TO DO IS JUST POP THE
HOOD UP LIKE THIS,

132
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,466
WE'LL MOUNT A SCREEN
ON THE INSIDE

133
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,068
AND THE SCREEN IS
RIGHT THERE IN
THEIR FACE.

134
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,807
OH. ALL RIGHT.

135
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,112
OKAY, WELL, THIS HOOD
OPENS THE WRONG WAY.

136
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,847
NICE WORK, HAROLD.

137
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,649
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
I'LL JUST TAKE HER OFF

138
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,351
AND WE'LL MOUNT
HER PROPERLY.

139
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,558
NOW, WHEN YOU REMOUNT THAT,
YOU COULD WELD ON
THE OLD HINGES

140
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,160
OR YOU COULD BOLT
ON NEW HINGES

141
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,661
OR YOU COULD USE
WHAT I USE,

142
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,531
THE HANDYMAN SECRET
WEAPON, DUCT TAPE.

143
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,067
NOW IT OPENS
THE RIGHT WAY.

144
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,468
THANK YOU JUST
THE SAME, HAROLD.

145
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:43,870
AND WE'LL PROP
THAT UP IN THERE.

146
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,239
AND NOW WHAT WE NEED
IS SOMETHING TO USE
AS A SCREEN.

147
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,040
I'M THINKING SOMETHING
CLEAN AND WHITE,

148
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,411
MAYBE ONE OF THE
LODGE SHEETS.

149
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,980
SOMETHING A LITTLE
CLEANER AND WHITER
THAN THAT.

150
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,583
I GOT AN IDEA.

151
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,425
DOOR OFF A FRIDGE.
USE THAT SIDE THERE.

152
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,895
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE
THE DOOR OFF A FRIDGE

153
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,430
BEFORE YOU THROW
IT OUT ANYWAY,

154
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,232
AND WE'LL HAVE
TO THROW THAT ONE
OUT NOW FOR SURE.

155
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:17,069
OKAY, SO WE GOT OUR SCREEN
MOUNTED INSIDE THE
HOOD THERE,

156
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:20,006
AND I'VE RUN THE POWER
SUPPLY BACK FROM THE BATTERY

157
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,575
COURTESY OF A COUPLE
OF SETS OF JUMPER CABLES,
USE AS MANY AS YOU LIKE.

158
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,811
AND THEY'RE GOING TO
POWER THE SLIDE
PROJECTOR HERE

159
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:29,782
WHICH I'M GOING TO THROW
IN UP ON TO THE BACK
SHELF OF THE CAR,

160
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,118
WHICH IS NOT REALLY
GOOD FOR ANYTHING ANYHOW.

161
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,320
HOOK THOSE UP.
THERE WE GO.

162
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,390
NOW TO POWER THE
WHOLE UNIT UP,

163
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,859
ALL'S WE HAVE TO DO
IS START THE CAR.

164
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,163
OH BOY, THAT'S
BRIGHT, ISN'T IT?

165
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:47,200
WOW.

166
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,935
BUT WE'VE LEFT OUT
THE ONE THING

167
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,803
THAT TEENAGERS ENJOY
DOING MOST AT A DRIVE-IN...

168
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,005
EATING POPCORN.

169
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:57,176
SO ALL'S WE GOT TO
DO IS TAKE THE LID OFF
OUR JAR OF POPCORN HERE

170
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,812
AND TURN HER UPSIDE DOWN
OVER THAT HOLE

171
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,715
THAT'S MAKING ALL THE
NOISE IN THE EXHAUST
MANIFOLD.

172
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,618
THERE WE GO.

173
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,421
NOW THE HEAT OF THE
ENGINE WILL POP
THE POPCORN.

174
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,022
[corn popping]
THERE WE GO.

175
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:11,858
AND SHE COMES
OUT BACK HERE.

176
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,435
OF COURSE WHAT
YOU WANT TO DO

177
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,136
IS TO ATTACH A PIECE
OF FLEXIBLE PIPING

178
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,973
SO YOU CAN CHANNEL
THAT POPCORN

179
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,575
UP INTO SOME KIND OF
A CONTAINER LIKE THAT.

180
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,812
AND YOU CAN
HAVE YOUR VARIOUS
OTHER TREATS IN HERE,

181
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,547
YOUR CHOCOLATE BARS, YOUR
DRINKS, YOUR WHAT HAVE YOU.

182
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,883
AND THERE YOU HAVE YOUR
VERY OWN PORTABLE
DRIVE-IN THEATRE

183
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,184
WITH ALL
THE ACCOUTREMENTS.

184
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,119
SO REMEMBER, IF WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

185
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,687
THEY SHOULD AT
LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

186
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,890
LET'S GET BACK
TO OUR SLIDE SHOW.

187
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,660
OH BOY, OH BOY, YOU'RE
GOING TO LOVE THIS.

188
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,097
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, IT'S A LITTLE
OUT OF FOCUS, I KNOW,

189
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:55,801
BUT SEE THAT GUY THERE,
I FORGET HIS NAME,
HE WAS FUNNY.

190
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:59,472
OH YEAH, THIS IS A
PICTURE OF HIS WIFE.

191
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:02,241
OH NO, THAT'S THE ROCKIES.

192
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,509
Red Green:
STAY TUNED.

193
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,912
HAROLD IS GOING TO CALL
FOR MY HIGH INSIDE HEAT

194
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,547
AND I'M GOING TO
TALK TO YOU TEENAGERS

195
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,315
ABOUT THOSE DARN
BICYCLES OF YOURS.

196
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,254
I SEE A LOT OF
YOU TEENAGERS ARE
RIDING BICYCLES OUT THERE.

197
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,557
AND I KNOW THAT'S GOOD
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
AND EVERYTHING

198
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,558
BUT WHAT A PAIN.

199
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:21,027
YOU RIDE IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE LANE

200
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,429
AND YOU COME AROUND
CORNERS JUST LIKE YOU
WERE A VEHICLE OR SOMETHING.

201
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,064
AND YOU'RE PRACTICALLY
INVISIBLE, YOU KNOW.

202
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,732
WHAT DO YOU WEIGH,
60 POUNDS?

203
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,301
AND YOU WEAR ONE OF
THEM SPANDEX SUITS

204
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,970
WRAPS YOUR BODY SO TIGHT
YOU LOOK LIKE A ROLL BAR.

205
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,705
YOU'RE RISKING YOUR
LIVES OUT THERE,

206
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,575
BECAUSE IF WE GET INTO
A MISUNDERSTANDING AS TO
WHO HAS THE RIGHT OF WAY,

207
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,576
I'M IN THE VAN,
YOU'RE IN A HELMET,

208
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:39,045
YOU LOSE!

209
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,646
NOW, I DON'T WANT
TO MAKE JUDGMENTS

210
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,581
ABOUT HOW YOU
TEENAGERS WANT
TO KILL YOURSELVES,

211
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:45,685
BUT I WOULD SUGGEST
THAT YOU EITHER GROW
UP AND GET A CAR

212
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,386
OR RIDE ON THE SIDEWALK.

213
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:50,456
BUT NOT MY SIDEWALK,
THAT'S WHERE I
PARK THE VAN.

214
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,628
WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE
SEEN BUSTER HADFIELD'S
PICTURES FROM HIS TRIP.

215
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,764
UNBELIEVABLE.
ALL TAKEN FROM
INSIDE THE CAR.

216
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,202
MOSTLY SHOTS OF THE
REARVIEW MIRROR,

217
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,537
EXCEPT FOR THE
CALIFORNIA ONES,

218
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,772
THEY WERE ALL
SUN VISOR SHOTS.

219
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,075
WELL, MAYBE THE CAMERA WAS
TOO COMPLICATED FOR HIM.

220
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,876
OH, YOU GOT THAT
RIGHT, HAROLD.

221
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:14,113
HE HAD 60 PICTURES
OF THE INSIDE OF
THE LENS CAP,

222
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,315
ALL OF THEM
OUT OF FOCUS.

223
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,284
AND THE REST OF THE
PICTURES WERE EITHER
OVEREXPOSED,

224
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,486
UNDEREXPOSED OR BORING.

225
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:24,023
I'LL TELL YOU, IF IT
WASN'T FOR THE PIMENTO
AND ONION CHEESE DIP,

226
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,025
NONE OF US WOULD
HAVE STAYED.

227
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,727
WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD,
YOU KNOW,

228
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,161
BECAUSE PICTURES
ARE EXPENSIVE.

229
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,997
I REMEMBER I PAID $12
FOR MY SCHOOL PORTRAIT.

230
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,799
WHEN I GOT IT BACK,
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT,
I LOOKED LIKE A GEEK.

231
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,535
[laughter]

232
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,639
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

233
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,474
NO, SERIOUSLY.

234
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,243
MUST HAVE GOT
MY BAD SIDE.

235
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,245
YEAH, YOUR FRONT.

236
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,548
BUT I'LL TELL YOU,
BUSTER HAS REALLY
LOST HIS MIND.

237
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,384
GET THIS,
HE SAYS HE CAN GET
ALL THE MONEY BACK

238
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,052
THAT HE SPENT
ON THE PICTURES

239
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,388
BY TAKING SILVER
OUT OF THE NEGATIVES.

240
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:58,824
SILVER, HAROLD, LIKE
THERE'S SILVER IN
FILM NEGATIVES.

241
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,726
WELL, THERE IS.

242
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,762
WELL, IN OLD FILM ANYWAY.

243
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:05,598
YEAH, I MEAN IT'S THE
SILVER THAT ACTUALLY
FORMS THE PICTURE.

244
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,066
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, HAROLD?

245
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,801
WELL, IN PHOTOGRAPHIC
FILM, UNTIL RECENTLY,

246
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,003
THEY USE LIKE FORMS
OF SILVER TO TAKE
THE PICTURE.

247
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,506
IT'S CALLED
SILVER HALIDE.

248
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,875
OH, WELL, OH SILVER
HALIDE, YEAH.

249
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,276
NO, NO, HE SAID SILVER.

250
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:20,679
THAT'S ALL I'M QUESTIONING,
YOU KNOW, THE SILVER.

251
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,449
YEAH. RIGHT.

252
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,184
SO, YEAH, OKAY,
ALL RIGHT.

253
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,054
BUT HE SAYS HE CAN
GET THE SILVER OUT
OF THE SILVER HALIDE.

254
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,156
LIKE GOOD LUCK,
BUSTER.

255
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,658
WELL, HE CAN IF HE
USES THE RIGHT EMULSION.

256
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:34,860
WELL, YEAH.

257
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,962
NO, I DON'T THINK
HE'S GOT THE -- SEE,
WELL, OKAY.

258
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:39,432
WHERE DID YOU GET
TO BE SUCH A GENIUS?

259
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:40,866
WELL, I'M NOT.

260
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,334
WELL, YOU'RE
SMARTER THAN I AM.

261
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:45,504
OH, YEAH, OKAY, YOU KNOW,
I'M A GENIUS TO YOU.

262
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,710
WINSTON ROTHSCHILD HERE

263
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,712
FOR ROTHSCHILD'S SEWAGE
AND SEPTIC SUCKING SERVICES

264
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:57,416
WHERE OUR MOTTO IS:
WASTE NOT, PUMP NOT,

265
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,386
1-800-555-SUCK.

266
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,389
Red Green: WE'RE OUT HERE
BY THE MAIN HIGHWAY

267
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,924
AT HUMPHREY'S
EVERYTHING STORE

268
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,759
WITH THE MAN WHO
KNOWS THE VALUE
OF EVERYTHING,

269
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,493
DALTON HUMPHRIES.

270
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:08,861
HELLO, DALTON.
HOW YOU DOING?

271
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,764
YEAH, RED, I'M JUST
HAVING A CHUCKLE AT
SOMEBODY ELSE'S EXPENSE.

272
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,766
OH, YEAH, WITH THAT
SILVER CUP THERE, EH?

273
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,601
NO, NO, NO, NO.
THIS ISN'T SILVER,
NO, NO.

274
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,503
THIS POLISHED ALUMINUM.

275
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,839
IT DOESN'T -- IT
DOESN'T HAVE THE
WEIGHT OF SILVER.

276
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,441
SO THAT'S PRETTY
MUCH WORTHLESS
I GUESS.

277
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,710
WELL, TO YOU
MAYBE, BUT, LOOK,

278
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:28,080
I'M GOING TO GIVE IT
SOME CHARACTER HERE.

279
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,352
THERE, THAT'S BETTER.

280
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,821
I WILL JUST ENGRAVE
"BABY" ON IT OR
SOMETHING

281
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,591
AND MAYBE
THE DATE 1802

282
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:42,561
AND I'LL SELL IT
FOR 400 BUCKS TO
SOME SUCKER.

283
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:45,064
THAT'S VERY
COMMENDABLE.

284
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,398
DALTON, DID YOU KNOW
WE GOT A PROJECT GOING

285
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,801
WHERE WE'RE TAKING
SILVER OUT OF FILM
NEGATIVES?

286
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,804
OH, YEAH.
YOU KNOW THERE'S A BETTER
WAY TO DO IT THAN THAT.

287
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,806
I SHOULDN'T BE
TELLING TRADE
SECRETS HERE,

288
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:57,843
BUT TAKE A LOOK AT
THIS PLATE HERE.
YEAH.

289
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,578
YOU SEE RIGHT AROUND
THE EDGE THERE

290
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,914
THERE'S A LITTLE BEADING
OF SILVER SOMEONE'S
PAINTED ON THERE?

291
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,549
YEAH.
UH-HUH.
UH-HUH.

292
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:04,783
YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S SILVER.

293
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:07,019
THAT'S REAL SILVER.
ISN'T THAT SOMETHING?

294
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,387
OH, YEAH.

295
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,055
YOU KNOW I GOT 400
OF THE THESE PLATES.

296
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,224
I GOT THEM WHEN THE
HOTEL WENT OUT
OF BUSINESS

297
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:15,528
OR MAYBE IT WAS AN
ASYLUM OR SOMETHING.

298
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,430
ANYWAY, I'M GOING
TO SIT DOWN WITH
A PUTTY KNIFE

299
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,366
FOR TWO OR
THREE WEEKS.
YEAH.

300
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,335
CHISEL ALL THAT
SILVER OFF THE EDGE.

301
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:24,904
AND WHEN I'M FINISHED,

302
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:27,706
I'M GOING TO HAVE
A WHOLE BAG FULL
OF SILVER,

303
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:31,710
A WHOLE BAG FULL,
A WHOLE BAG.

304
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,082
YOU KNOW WHAT I
NOTICED, UNCLE RED,

305
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:38,684
WHEN GUYS TAKE
THEIR DATES OUT,

306
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,419
YOU KNOW, TO PLAYS
AND RESTAURANTS AND
MOVIES AND STUFF,

307
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:43,322
BUT AFTER THEY GET
MARRIED, THEY HARDLY
EVER GO OUT ANY MORE.

308
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:47,393
WELL, NO, THAT'S
ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS
FOR GETTING MARRIED.

309
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:48,894
WELL, IF I GET MARRIED,

310
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,729
I'M GOING TO TAKE MY
WIFE OUT ON DATES
ALL THE TIME

311
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,298
JUST TO SHOW HER
THAT I LOVE HER.

312
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:55,067
I THINK IT WILL LOOK
MORE LIKE GRATITUDE
THAN LOVE, HAROLD.

313
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,469
JUST BECAUSE A
COUPLE DON'T GO
OUT TOGETHER ANYMORE

314
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,672
DOESN'T MEAN THEY
DON'T LOVE EACH OTHER,

315
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,774
THEY JUST GET
BUSY, THAT'S ALL.
BUSY?

316
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,610
WHAT CAN BE MORE
IMPORTANT THAN SPENDING
TIME WITH YOUR SWEETHEART?

317
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,812
WELL, THE PRIORITIES
OF DAILY LIVING,
HAROLD.

318
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,882
BILLS TO PAY, MAYBE
OVERTIME AT THE OFFICE,
WORK AROUND THE HOUSE,

319
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,818
PERHAPS A SPORTING
EVENT ON TELEVISION,
THAT KIND OF THING.

320
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:14,320
I JUST HAPPEN
TO THINK THAT
MARRIED SPOUSES

321
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,922
TAKE EACH OTHER
FOR GRANTED.

322
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,491
WELL, HAROLD, YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU SPEND A LOT OF
TIME WITH SOMEBODY,

323
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:22,595
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY
MAKE YOU EAGER TO SPEND
MORE TIME WITH THEM.

324
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,430
YOU AND I
HAVE PROVEN THAT.

325
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,166
THAT'S DIFFERENT.
WE'RE LIKE, YOU
KNOW, GUYS,

326
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,202
WHEREAS A GUY AND
A GIRL ARE LIKE,
YOU KNOW.

327
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,605
WELL, THERE'S
SOMETHING ELSE YOU
SHOULD KNOW, HAROLD.

328
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,540
AFTER YOU
GET MARRIED, 99
PERCENT OF THE TIME

329
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,776
SLEEPING TOGETHER
MEANS SLEEPING
TOGETHER.

330
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:40,045
NO WAY.

331
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,349
I'LL NEVER
BE THAT TIRED!

332
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:44,383
WELL, MAYBE NOT,

333
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,285
BUT EVERY GIRL WITHIN
100 MILES OF YOU

334
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,487
WILL BE THAT
TIRED, BELIEVE ME.

335
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,657
NO PROBLEM,
I'LL MOVE.

336
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,428
Red Green:
WELL, HAROLD AND I HAD A
BIG DAY OF RELAXING PLANNED

337
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,597
BUT BILL HAD ASKED US
TO COME OUT AND TAKE PART

338
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:01,467
IN AMERICA'S
FAVOURITE PAST-TIME,

339
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,435
WHICH I WAS DISAPPOINTED
TO SEE WAS BASEBALL.

340
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,070
SO ANYWAY, HE HAD
ALL THE GEAR THERE

341
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,239
AND HE WANTED
ME TO GO OUT AND
PITCH THE BALL.

342
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,175
WHY HE HANDED ME
A BATTING HELMET I
COULDN'T UNDERSTAND,

343
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,577
BUT WITH BILL,
YOU KNOW,

344
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,413
YOU'RE ALWAYS
BETTER TO HAVE SOME
PROTECTIVE GEAR ON.

345
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,248
SO HAROLD'S GOING
TO BE THE CATCHER
I GUESS

346
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,983
AND BILL
IS HELPING HIM.

347
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,019
THIS IS HELPING
I SUPPOSE.

348
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,687
OH MY GOSH.

349
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,956
IT COULD BE A
WHILE I SUPPOSE.

350
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,624
ALL RIGHT, HE GOT THE
ONE LEG GOING ON,

351
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:26,992
NOW THEY GOT THE OTHER--

352
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,560
THE CATCHER HAS
TO HAVE THE PADDING
ON AND EVERYTHING.

353
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,896
BUT I THINK MAYBE
HAROLD MIGHT BE
BETTER ON HIS OWN.

354
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:33,332
OF COURSE, I'VE
ALWAYS SAID THAT.

355
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,635
YOU GUYS GOING
TO BE LONG?

356
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:39,738
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY
A LOT OF PEOPLE COME
OUT TO SEE THESE GAMES.

357
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,240
OH, THERE WE GO.
ALL RIGHT.

358
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,676
LET'S GO.
OH!

359
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:46,178
HOW CAN YOU HAVE
STRIKE ONE ON YOU

360
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:47,880
AND THE BALL HASN'T
EVEN BEEN THROWN YET?

361
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,215
YEAH, HE'S FINE
BILL, YEAH.

362
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:53,252
HAROLD?
NO, HAROLD.

363
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,386
HAROLD?
OVER HERE.

364
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:55,621
HERE BOY.
HERE BOY.

365
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,922
THERE WE GO.

366
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:58,490
ALL RIGHT, FINALLY.

367
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,693
DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO GIVE
HIM MY KNUCKLER

368
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,127
OR MY SLIDING,
SINKING FAST BALL.

369
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,630
WHAT?
WHAT?
WHAT?

370
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,433
TIME OUT.

371
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,435
WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM NOW?

372
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,804
HE DOESN'T LIKE THE BAT.

373
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,708
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

374
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,843
ALL RIGHT, JUST
PICK A BAT, BILL.

375
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:19,678
BY NOW HAROLD AND
I ARE GETTING A
LITTLE BORED

376
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,280
AND HAVING A
GAME OF CATCH.

377
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,982
WELL, ONE OF US IS.

378
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:25,584
OH MAN.

379
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:28,721
OH, OH, OH, OH,
OH, OH, OH.

380
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,256
OH, LOOK OUT.
OH, OH.

381
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,625
NICE ONE.

382
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:37,096
I SEE YOU PICKED
YOURSELF A BAT
THERE, EH, BILL?

383
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:40,032
ALL RIGHT.
OH MY GOSH.

384
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,034
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

385
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,135
WHAT?
WHAT?

386
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:46,638
OH FOR GOSH SAKE.

387
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,243
I HAVE NOTHING TO
SAY ABOUT THAT.

388
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,178
ALL RIGHT, I'M
LOOKING FOR MY SIGN.

389
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,147
NO, NO, DON'T
LIKE THAT ONE, NO,

390
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,048
NO, NO.

391
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,784
YES, SIR, THAT'S
THE ONE I LIKE.

392
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,587
HIGH HEAT.

393
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,957
I BELIEVE YOU'RE
OUT AT THE PLATE, SIR.

394
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,093
THAT A BOY, HAROLD,
NICE GRIP, THAT'S WORKS.

395
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,430
STAY TUNED FOR
SOME DRY DOCK POETRY

396
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,133
AND THEN WINSTON TRIES
TO GET A HOLD OF A BIG ONE.

397
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,806
"APRIL LOVE," BY ME.

398
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,908
"ON A SUNNY APRIL
DAY YEARS AGO,

399
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,344
"MY MOTHER
TURNED SWEET 16.

400
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:28,814
"THEN MY FATHER MET MY
MOTHER ON ANOTHER
SUNNY APRIL DAY.

401
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,883
"AND ON A THIRD SUNNY
DAY IN APRIL,

402
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,985
"THEY FIRST KISSED
AND FELL IN LOVE.

403
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,287
"AND ANOTHER APRIL
DAY THEY WED

404
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,923
"AS THE SUN SHONE
FROM ABOVE.

405
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:41,360
"AND I WAS BORN YET
ANOTHER SUNNY DAY IN APRIL.

406
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,362
"I'M TOLD THAT WAS
ONE OF THE FEW APRILS

407
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,664
"WHERE WE HAD FIVE
SUNNY DAYS IN A ROW."

408
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,436
WELL, THIS IDEA OF
GETTING SILVER OUT
OF THE FILM NEGATIVES

409
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:53,939
HAS KIND OF STARTED A
BIT OF A GOLD RUSH UP
HERE AT THE LODGE.

410
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,874
EVERYBODY IS GOING BACK,
DIGGING UP ALL THEIR
OLD STUFF

411
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,342
AND THROWING IT
INTO THE POT.

412
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:00,245
A LOT OF WEDDING
PHOTOS SHOWING UP THERE.

413
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:05,350
EXCEPT FOR
OLD MAN SEDGWICK,

414
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,718
I THINK YOU GUYS
SHOULD REALIZE,
YOU KNOW,

415
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:10,022
THAT GETTING SILVER
FROM FILM IS A VERY
LOW YIELD EXERCISE.

416
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:14,026
WELL, LOW YIELD IS KIND
OF OUR SPECIALTY UP
AT THE LODGE.

417
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,295
BUT THERE'S LIKE A MILLIONTH
OF A SMIDGE OF SILVER

418
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:17,796
IN EACH PHOTOGRAPH,
YOU KNOW.

419
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,832
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
LIKE 100 ROLLS OF FILM

420
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,533
JUST TO GET ONE
OUNCE OF SILVER.

421
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:25,904
YOU KNOW HOW
MUCH ONE OUNCE OF
SILVER IS WORTH, $6.

422
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:28,340
YOU KNOW WHAT 100 ROLLS OF
OUR FILM IS IS WORTH?

423
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,342
NOTHING.

424
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,644
UNLESS MAYBE WE COVER
THEM WITH MOLASSES

425
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,847
AND USE THEM
AS FLY STRIPS.

426
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,982
YEAH, BUT WHAT
ABOUT ALL THE HOURS
OF WORK YOU PUT INTO IT,

427
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,417
YOU KNOW, THE MONEY
YOU SPENT ON CHEMICALS?

428
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,885
YOU'RE NO FURTHER AHEAD.

429
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,253
WELL, SURE WE
ARE, HAROLD.

430
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:42,521
WE'RE LEARNING
SOMETHING, WE'RE
HAVING FUN,

431
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,923
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY
WE'RE NOT OUT IN CARS
OR OUR BOATS

432
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:48,160
WHERE WE DO THE REAL
EXPENSIVE DAMAGE.

433
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,730
YOU GUYS HAVE A VERY
WARPED SENSE OF ECONOMY.

434
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,999
WELL, HAROLD, WHEN
YOU GET TO OUR AGE,
YOU GIVE UP ON WINNING,

435
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:58,737
YOU JUST TRY TO LOSE
AS SLOWLY AS POSSIBLE.

436
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,941
WELL, ALL THIS TALK
OF SILVER STOCKS AND
PROFIT MARGINS

437
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,476
HAS GOT OUR
HEADS SPINNING,

438
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,411
SO I THOUGHT WE'D GET SOME
SOUND BUSINESS ADVICE

439
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:07,679
FROM WINSTON ROTHSCHILD,

440
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,948
BECAUSE WHEN WINSTON
TALKS, PEOPLE BACK OFF.

441
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:15,220
WELL, IF IT ISN'T RED,
THE SILVER FOX.

442
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,891
HEY, WINSTON,
HOW'S BUSINESS?
IT SUCKS.

443
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,859
SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

444
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,262
NO, NO, IT'S A JOKE.
IT SUCKS.

445
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:26,265
HOSE, SEPTIC,
SUCK, YOU KNOW.

446
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:31,136
LISTEN, I GOT SOME
FILM HERE FOR YOU,
IF YOU WANT TO BUY IT.

447
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:32,905
WELL, ALL RIGHT.

448
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,107
I'M SURPRISED YOU WANT
TO PART WITH THESE
FAMILY MEMENTOS.

449
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:40,279
ACTUALLY THEY'RE
RECENT PICTURES OF
MY OLD MAN, EH,

450
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:44,716
AND TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH, YOU'D BE
DOING HIM A FAVOUR, EH,

451
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:47,553
BECAUSE MOST OF THEM
COULD BE USED AGAINST
HIM IN A COURT OF LAW.

452
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:48,754
OH. SURE. YEAH.

453
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:52,925
SO WINSTON, DO YOU HAVE
ANY BUSINESS ADVICE FOR
US ON THIS DEAL?

454
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,860
RED, YOU GOT TO
FOLLOW YOUR HEART.

455
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,895
ALL RIGHT.
YEAH.
FOLLOW YOUR HEART.

456
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,898
YOU KNOW, IF YOU FEEL
STRONGLY ABOUT THIS
SILVER PROJECT,

457
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,733
I SAY GO
FOR IT, EH?

458
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,869
LIKE YOU'RE NOT IN
IT FOR JUST THE
MONEY, ARE YOU?

459
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,638
NOT SO FAR.
THERE YOU GO.

460
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:09,274
BOY, I'LL TELL YOU,
I DONE A LOT OF
CRAZY THINGS

461
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,243
IN THE EARLY
YEARS MYSELF, EH?

462
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:14,112
LIKE, FOR INSTANCE,
ONCE I STARTED OUT THIS
WHOLE MAIL ORDER THING,

463
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,281
BUT THEN SOME IDIOT
BROKE THE CHAIN

464
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:19,818
AND NEVER SENT
A DOLLAR TO SEVEN
OF HIS FRIENDS, EH?

465
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,720
AND THEN I GOT INTO
THIS PYRAMID SCHEME

466
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,122
WHICH QUICKLY
COLLAPSED INTO
A RHOMBOID.

467
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:26,224
BOY, I LOST MY
SHIRT ON THAT ONE.

468
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:29,027
AND THEN I STARTED
SELLING SEEDS AND
GREETING CARDS,

469
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,964
BUT THE PRIZES WERE
NEVER AS GOOD
AS THEY LOOK

470
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,366
ON THE BACK OF
THE COMIC BOOKS, EH?
NO, I'VE BEEN THERE.

471
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:37,469
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT,
THEN I FOUND SOMETHING
THAT I WAS GOOD AT

472
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,304
AND I REALLY
ENJOYED.

473
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,440
WELL, WHY ARE YOU
IN THE SEWAGE BUSINESS?

474
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,609
NO, THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

475
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,344
THIS IS WHAT I LIKE
MOST IN LIFE.

476
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,247
WOW.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

477
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,050
BOY, THAT WAS A
DOUBLE FLUSHER.

478
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,453
SO I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE, YOU KNOW,

479
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:57,389
MAYBE THE SILVER
ESCAPADE COULD BE,
YOU KNOW,

480
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,392
IF YOU'RE LUCKY,
YOUR SEWAGE PLANT.

481
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:01,827
YEAH, IT
WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME.

482
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:05,097
I HEAR THE DISTANT
SOUND OF EVERYTHING
GOING DOWN THE DRAIN.

483
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,468
WELL, THIS GETTING
THE SILVER OUT OF
THE FILM NEGATIVES

484
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,769
STARTED OFF A
LITTLE BIT SLOW

485
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,471
BUT THEN WE GOT KIND
OF AN ASSEMBLY LINE
THING GOING THERE.

486
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,172
BUSTER HADFIELD WOULD
UNROLL THE FILM,

487
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,775
MOOSE WOULD GET THE
EMULSION OFF WITH
A BELT SANDER

488
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,845
AND THEN JUNIOR
SINGLETON WOULD SUCK
IT UP WITH A VACUUM

489
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,180
AND THEN I WOULD DISSOLVE
THE DUST INTO VINEGAR,

490
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,383
AND THEN OLD MAN SEDGWICK
GOT THE SILVER OUT
OF THE VINEGAR

491
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:27,686
BY USING ELECTRICITY
HOOKED UP TO HIS PACEMAKER.

492
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,855
I'LL TELL YOU, THERE
CAN'T BE ONE GOOD
ROLL OF FILM

493
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,857
LEFT IN ALL
OF POSSUM COUNTY.

494
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:35,694
MOOSE EVEN DONATED ALL
THE MUGSHOTS HE'S HAD
DONE OVER THE YEARS.

495
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:38,797
AND HOW MANY INGOTS
OF SILVER DID YOU GET
WITH ALL YOUR EFFORT?

496
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,899
ONE TINY LITTLE
GLOB, HAROLD,

497
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:44,569
ABOUT THE SIZE
OF YOUR BRAIN.

498
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,271
WELL, WELL, WELL,
WELL, WELL, 

499
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:48,473
GOOD BUSINESS
MOVE, UNCLE RED.

500
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,908
YOU GO TO CASH
THAT IN,

501
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:53,578
YOU'LL FIND YOU
PROBABLY WORKED FOR
ABOUT, OH, TWO CENTS A DAY,

502
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:56,081
WHICH, COME TO THINK OF
IT, IS PROBABLY ALL
YOUR TIME IS WORTH.

503
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,051
WELL, WE'RE NOT GOING
TO CASH IT IN FOR
A WHILE, HAROLD,

504
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,286
WE'RE GOING TO HANG
ON TO IT UNTIL SILVER
GOES UP ENOUGH IN VALUE

505
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,255
THAT WE CAN MAKE
MONEY ON THIS.

506
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:06,291
WELL, I DON'T THINK THE
PLANET EARTH IS GOING TO
BE AROUND THAT LONG.

507
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,293
OH, SURE IT
WILL, HAROLD.

508
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:09,961
THE BIG QUESTION IS,
WHO DO WE TRUST

509
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,930
TO HANG ON
TO THE SILVER
WHILE WE'RE WAITING.

510
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,166
SO WE TOOK A PAGE
OUT OF THE LONE
RANGER'S BOOK,

511
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,068
WE MELTED HER DOWN
INTO A BULLET,

512
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,136
WE WENT DOWN AND
FIRED HER INTO
THE DEAD TREE

513
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:19,571
IN THE CENTRE OF
THE TOWN PARK.

514
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:20,939
WHICH TREE?

515
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,575
THE SILVER BIRCH.

516
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,944
WE'RE NOT
STUPID, HAROLD.

517
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:29,281
OH NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

518
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,416
[possum squealing]

519
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:32,784
THAT'S THE CRY
OF THE POSSUM.

520
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:35,354
IT'S MEETING TIME,
KEMOSABE.

521
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,657
WELL, I'D CALL HIM
TONTO, BUT HE'S
MORE LIKE TOTO.

522
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,225
I'LL BE DOWN IN
A WHILE, HAROLD.

523
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,560
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

524
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,095
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT
HOME AFTER THE MEETING,

525
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:45,130
AND IF YOU'RE
WONDERING WHAT
I GOT YOUR SISTER

526
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,865
FOR HER SILVER
ANNIVERSARY,

527
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,367
TELL HER IT'S
IN THE PARK.

528
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,569
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,

529
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:51,937
THANKS SO MUCH
FOR WATCHING.

530
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,939
AND UNTIL THE NEXT TIME
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND HAROLD

531
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:55,807
AND THE WHOLE GANG
UP HERE AT POSSUM LODGE,

532
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,909
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

533
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:01,913
[cheers and applause]

534
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:05,050
[quirky upbeat music]  

535
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,553
[possum squealing]

536
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:24,770
HAROLD:
EVERYBODY RISE UP!

537
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:30,776
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI
