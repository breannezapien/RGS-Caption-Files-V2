00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:46,413
And now it's time for the show
that everybody is talking about,

4
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:49,582
in no uncertain terms, and
some of them even favorable.

5
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,318
A show that lives in the heart
of the heartland, where it

6
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,654
leaves the livers by the
bladders of the gall.

7
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:55,789
What am I saying?

8
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:57,924
I have no idea what!

9
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:59,959
I should write some of this down
before the show, actually.

10
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:03,096
Anyway, here's the star of the
Red Green Show, my uncle Red

11
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:06,599
Green! Uncle Red Green!

12
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:11,604
Thank you, Harold. Thank you
and welcome to Possum Lodge.

13
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:15,041
I should invite you...just take
Harold with a grain of salt.

14
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:18,111
In fact, side by side, you
can't tell them apart.

15
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,980
Although, you know, he is my
nephew and blood is thicker than

16
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,016
water, although nothing is
quite as thick as Harold.

17
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,919
Well, I think maybe the audience
can easily

18
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,587
identify intelligence, eh?

19
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,022
For example, this takes
intelligence!

20
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,594
[laughs] Operating a digital
effects unit.

21
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,397
The machine has the
intelligence, the operator is a

22
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:40,400
support system. I just don't
like getting surprised like

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,634
that. Not that I'm against
surprises.

24
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,304
I mean, I have thrown as many
buckets of ice water into a

25
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:45,438
sleeping bag as anybody.

26
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:49,075
The trouble starts when maybe a
lodge member can't differentiate

27
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:53,746
between a surprise and a prank
because, you know, if something

28
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:56,182
happens, that doesn't involve
loss of consciousness or

29
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:59,519
hospitalization, it really is a
surprise as opposed to a prank,

30
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,021
and doesn't really have a place
in lodge life, as far as I'm

31
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:02,489
concerned.

32
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:05,658
Whereas like a prank that maims
or kills is everybody's

33
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:07,360
favorite.

34
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,295
Well, as usual, you're
exaggerating Harold, just like

35
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,930
your father did when he got me
to hire you.

36
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,768
Any stunt that involves either
personal injury or property

37
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:18,605
damage makes a heck of a lot
more interesting story a couple

38
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:21,508
of years down the road when
we're all in our declining years

39
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:24,344
and doing a little more
reflecting than shining.

40
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,913
Well, I just want you to know
that I'm opposed to any childish

41
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,748
adventures or, or irresponsible
behavior.

42
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,819
Oh, Harold, that wedgie didn't
hurt that much, did it?

43
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:37,824
Well, quite a bit, especially if
you hook a person's underwear to

44
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,725
a power hoist.

45
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:42,095
All right. Maybe we did go a
little, a little too far with

46
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,364
that. If you could have seen
the look on your face.

47
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,032
Hardy har har.

48
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:47,667
I took it like a man, didn't I?

49
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,270
But if my children don't grow
up to be as tall as they should

50
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,304
be, I may sue.

51
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,111
It's a work day for me, too,
Harold.

52
00:02:58,645 --> 00:02:59,312
Yeah?

53
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,981
Yeah, today I'll be testing soil
density for the Department of

54
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:03,082
Natural Resources.

55
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:07,554
I just do it on the golf course
to avoid boredom, that sort of

56
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:10,023
thing. It keeps me sharp and
more effective as a government

57
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,391
official.

58
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,826
Wow. That sounds...I guess
incredible is the word for that,

59
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,962
isn't it?

60
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:19,299
Well, Harold...in a couple of
days, it'll be my birthday.

61
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,703
I'll be turning a year older.

62
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,339
Be great if I shot par today,
though, huh?

63
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,141
That would be a good birthday
present.

64
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:30,543
Never shot par, Bob?

65
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,879
Well, I have on the scorecard,
just never on the golf course.

66
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,847
Good luck, Harold.

67
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,016
Be nice, you know you don't even
have to shoot par...just be

68
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:40,220
great if you didn't wing your
clubs into the lake.

69
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,591
The wind did that. I'll be on
the golf course all day.

70
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,861
You workaholic you. I think
Bob's patterned his civil

71
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:53,266
service career after Gerald
Ford, Eddie, I told you not to

72
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,300
buy the bikini briefs.

73
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:56,202
I didn't want Bob to see me.

74
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,405
I think we should have a
surprise birthday party for Bob.

75
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,573
I started on the cake.

76
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:02,275
That's the nose.

77
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,813
Woah! It's not a swimming party,
is it ED?

78
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,250
Uncle Red, I think a surprise
party is an excellent idea.

79
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:11,884
All right, then you try the
cake.

80
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,156
I may have gone a bit too heavy
on the prunes.

81
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:21,261
We prepare a special meal
around the campfire, and then

82
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,897
afterwards, we could all say
things about Bob and, you know,

83
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:28,268
he'd think we were kidding, and
then we could, we could divide

84
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,337
into groups and do vignettes
from famous Broadway musicals

85
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:35,842
like [SINGING] Oklahoma, where
the wind comes swirling around

86
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,010
the plain.

87
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,178
What do you think?

88
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:40,980
I think that's the kind of plan
that could lead to some fairly

89
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,584
major violence, really.

90
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:50,423
Red, as you know, I am a gourmet
cook and a performer of some

91
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:50,823
note.

92
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,793
Well, we don't want to hear the
note right now, Eddie.

93
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:57,497
And I'd be perfectly willing to
stage this party.

94
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:03,236
But if someone who doesn't know
a petite four from a pâté de

95
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,972
foie gras wants to make a
suggestion, well, I'm all ears.

96
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,040
Ok, how 'bout this? How 'bout
this? Right?

97
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,175
Ok? We get, like, some music
videos happening, right?

98
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,511
We get, like, a live music rap
group doing their thing in the

99
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,845
corner, right? They can be
doing that.

100
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,480
And we get, like, a laser light
show happening.

101
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,049
That'd be cool. And then we
can order pizzas.

102
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,483
Have, like, 50 pizzas. That, we
could do that.

103
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,551
You can do that. You wanna do
that?

104
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,153
We could do that. If you wanna
do that.

105
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:20,553
Wanna do that?

106
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,390
Harold...uh...would you mind
going down to the lake for a

107
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,525
minute?

108
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:26,793
What for?

109
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:27,660
Uh, to stick your head in it.

110
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:30,496
That was cruel.

111
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,899
Not compared to the other things
I thought of.

112
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,601
Do I have to, like, stick my
head right in it? Can I not, you

113
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,504
know, it's like, sit real close
to the edge?

114
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,106
I'd make it the far edge.

115
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:45,178
Excellent!

116
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,779
Well, how 'bout this for a
memorable party?

117
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:50,750
We all pile into the RV, we hit
the open road, we go till the

118
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,820
gas tank's empty and the
holding tank's full.

119
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,155
I think we'd have to be going
somewhere, otherwise, we

120
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:56,923
wouldn't know when we were
lost.

121
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:03,563
Ok, how about Augusta, Georgia,
home of the world-famous Masters

122
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,032
Golf Tournament? Huh? You think
Bob would maybe enjoy that at

123
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,233
all?

124
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,536
That's not a party, that's a
prize on the Dating Game.

125
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,772
Well, you don't have to go,
then. I mean, you can stay here

126
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,040
and learn some more show tunes.

127
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:17,076
Well, I think we should just
celebrate the birthday the way

128
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:19,912
we celebrate every birthday at
the lodge...we just ignore it.

129
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,547
I'll see you guys later.

130
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:26,285
Listen, this, the idea for a
party was my idea in the first

131
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:26,786
place.

132
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:27,887
Well, let's have it in the RV.

133
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,022
What's the difference?

134
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,491
Because there's no style to
that.

135
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,126
No panache.

136
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,928
I mean, we'd look like a bunch
of itinerant worm pickers.

137
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,630
Woah. Hey. Don't bring a
religion into it.

138
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,698
All right?

139
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,033
Worm picking isn't a religion.

140
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,569
I meant "itinerant." RV guys
like me don't like to hear the

141
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,105
use of that kind of language.

142
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,473
Hello, Harold.

143
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:48,374
Hi.

144
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:51,010
Mr. Miranda, I presume?

[strumming guitar] My favorite p
I've had them for years.

146
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,922
Comfortable like you wouldn't

147
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:07,160
believe. $13.95 at Sears.

148
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,598
Since I first got them I've
gained a few pounds, now my gut

149
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,435
kind of spills over top and
pushes 'em down.

150
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:20,773
My wife says they're too tight,
so I just show her they still

151
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,043
fit me fine, they're just 8 or
9 inches lower.

152
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:37,056
This week on Handyman Corner,
we're gonna show you a fabulous,

fabulous lawn and garden
instrument, the leaf blower.

00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,963
Now to me, the leaf blower is
the greatest invention since

155
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,465
chainsaw or duct tape.

156
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,700
Well, not counting twist-off
caps.

157
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,469
Now this is, this is too long.

158
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:53,206
We only need a few feet of this
, so I'm gonna cut this with

159
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:57,176
some tin snips, but I need to
drill a pilot hole first, so

160
00:07:57,176 --> 00:08:01,247
I'll just snug her up in the
vise and start the pilot hole

161
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:01,681
here.

162
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:15,094
Maybe I can think of a smarter
way to do this.

163
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:28,875
No. I know, I know what it is
...this is metal, and I'm using

164
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:29,909
a wood bit on this.

165
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,312
Gosh. I should be using a saw.

166
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:44,156
Ok, now we're going to need
something to blow air.

167
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,592
Now, I would suggest Old Man
Sedgwick, but I do have the

168
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:50,029
environment to think of. So
instead, I recommend one of

169
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,766
these deals here. This is one
of these hot air dryers that you

170
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,401
see in a washroom at a
restaurant.

171
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,070
You know, I mean, restaurants
are always going out of

172
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,805
business. You can pick one of
these up real cheap.

173
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,642
Or, if you really want to save
a bundle, you can go into a

174
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,511
self-serve gas station and
just, just serve yourself.

175
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,981
Uh, so first thing we ought to
do with this before we can use

176
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,516
it is we've gotta disconnect
the heater.

177
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:18,591
Lift the cover off there, and
...oh, it's like a computer in

178
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,594
there. Aw, no.

179
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,796
There, that's... this'll be the
hater connection here.

180
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:31,804
Yeah, I've got it. Okay, pop
that back on, and we're ready

181
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,072
for our final assembly.

182
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:38,010
Just smooth her right down and
, and there you have it.

183
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,078
You're ready for autumn.

184
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,082
You've got your very own,
one-of-a-kind, homemade leaf

185
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,884
blower. So remember, until next
time.

186
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:48,154
...if the women don't find you
handsome, they should at least

187
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:48,921
find you handy.

188
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,159
It is summer.

189
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:30,229
Sunbathers lolling in two-piece
bathing suits.

190
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,965
The brunette wears hers to get
a tan.

191
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,700
The blonde wears hers to get a
man.

192
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,771
The redhead wears hers to get
whistles.

193
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,507
And the bald fat guy wears his
for medical reasons.

194
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,784
So now everybody wants to give
Bob a surprise birthday party,

195
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,253
but I'm kind of against it
because, you know, first of all,

196
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,222
if it's his birthday, he's
gonna expect something.

197
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,657
You know, that's not really
gonna be much of a surprise.

198
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,192
What I'd rather do is take it
out, like take something like

199
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,995
April Fool's Day and make it a
completely different day without

200
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,931
telling anybody and then walk
up behind them and pull their

201
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,300
pants down on national
television. Now, that would be a

202
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,336
surprise. Right, Harold?

203
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,504
Right.

204
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,507
Yeah. Or, or say, you know,
Buster Hadfield has a date and

205
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,510
what you do is you put itching
powder all over the back seat of

206
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,778
his car. Huh?

207
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,280
That's not only fun, that's a
life lesson.

208
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,550
If you keep your clothes on,
you don't end up scratching.

209
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,353
You know, I might consider that
an invasion of privacy, Uncle

210
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,788
Red.

211
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,690
Oh, Harold, you know, you think
we should all behave like we're

212
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,958
all on the Lawrence Welk Show.

213
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,727
And if you were in charge,
nobody would ever be allowed to

214
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,062
yell "pile on." That's boring,
Harold.

215
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:40,299
Well, maybe I'd rather be boring
than to find plums in the toes

216
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,935
of my shoes. Has anyone ever
really stopped to consider that?

217
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,504
Aww...you're a wet blanket.

218
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:48,174
That's another thing, I resented
that wet blanket.

219
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,542
Aww, relax Harold. Gasoline
evaporates.

220
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,245
I'll take a prank over a
surprise any day.

221
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:57,516
Wow. I hope you feel the same
way after your lunch break

222
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:58,718
today, Uncle Red.

223
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,288
I'm not eating my lunch, Harold,
I gave it to Helmut.

224
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:06,158
Uh oh.

225
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:10,129
Oh, Bob, I think that maybe, I
think maybe you need to unwind a

226
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:13,032
little bit, you know? Maybe get
some professional help.

227
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,901
Or, or what about taking a year
off?

228
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,470
Or if you can't do that, bob,
I've got an idea...

229
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,239
how about a party? What if we
had a party of some kind?

230
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,474
Let me tell you something,
Red...

231
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,410
it's my birthday coming up
pretty soon.

232
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:25,644
Did you know that?

233
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,181
Uh, no. No, I didn't realize you
had a birthday.

234
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:30,616
Well, I wish I didn't.

235
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:36,255
You see, when I was a little
boy, my, my grandmother used to

236
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,158
stage these surprise birthday
parties for me.

237
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:40,292
Well, that was awful nice of
her, wasn't it?

238
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:47,032
I hated them. One shrieking
"surprise!" Looking at you.

239
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,235
Staring right at you to see what
your reaction would be.

240
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:55,374
"Did we fool you? Was it a
surprise?" And you had to be

241
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,309
happy, you had to pretend you
were happy all the time, no

242
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,812
matter how angry you felt and
you got crappy gifts.

243
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,682
Why didn't you just tell your
grandmother you felt that way?

244
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,785
Oh not, my grandmother. No way.

245
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:08,454
My grandmother could hurt you
if she wanted to.

246
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:12,792
Yeah. Once I saw her bring a
postman to his knees just with a

247
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,093
pair of salad tongs.

248
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,862
No. I stayed quiet...and
healthy.

249
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,431
I just pretended I enjoyed
myself.

250
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,837
That's why, to this day, I hate
surprises, just hate them.

251
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:29,308
That's why I took the job with
the government.

252
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,609
That's, that's too bad, Bob.

253
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,444
Yeah. That's why I like golf,
you know?

254
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:36,549
If you do everything right,
everything just goes exactly as

255
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,650
planned.

256
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:45,558
I suppose. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah.

257
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,860
Oh my God! It's gone into the
water hole!

258
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,165
This next portion is brought to
you by the good people who make

259
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,634
bandages and splints and iodine
...

260
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,370
Adventures with Bill.

261
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,973
And that Bill had made himself a
pair of stilts.

262
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,541
We're gonna try them out today.

263
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,676
So he wanted to start over
here.

264
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,478
Oh, my.

265
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:08,981
If he told me he was gonna stop.

266
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,153
..ahh. So. Good start. You know,
I think it was Sigmund Freud who

267
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:17,790
said, "If you don't go through
some developmental stage, stages

268
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,993
of development in a kind of an
order when you're a kid, you

269
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,829
don't go through them in the
right order, or if you miss one,

270
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:30,002
then you gotta go through it
later in life." And, of course,

271
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:33,138
when he said it, it wasn't
quite that clear, but I don't

272
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:37,343
think Bill ever experienced
stilts as a kid, so he wanted to

273
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:38,644
try them as an adult.

274
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:41,647
I think it's more of a kid
thing because I think when you

275
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,183
get to be, you have too much
weight and he's trying this

276
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,852
technique and, uh...

277
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,888
I was afraid he was gonna back
us all the way to town.

278
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,590
Then we tried this, where I
would hold the weight, and boy,

279
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:55,294
this is not only heavy, but not
the greatest view you'd ever

280
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:58,130
want to have. But at least I
got him up there!

281
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,865
I got him...OK, OK, OK, OK.

282
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:03,903
No, no, no, no. But the thing
with Bill is he just doesn't

283
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,039
give up until he's really,
really hurt somebody.

284
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,841
Should get something to stand on
and maybe...

285
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,911
Oh! Well, that's, that's good.

286
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,112
Thank you, Bill. Thank you.

287
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:16,849
There goes our matching
furniture. You get that out from

288
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,450
there. And then we got some
garbage cans, thought he could

289
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:21,253
stand on them. Maybe that would
give them a leg up, so to speak.

290
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,823
But he got one and he got kind
of, he got kind of carried away

291
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:27,393
and he ended up sticking one of
the legs of the stilts in right

292
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:30,596
into the garbage can, and then
he, trying to get that out, and

293
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,831
he didn't know how he was going
to do that.

294
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:36,135
And, and then he'd only put one
nail in where the feet thing

295
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:41,941
go, so, instead of there up and
then down, oh oh oh!

296
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,443
He wedged right in there and it
was kind of the inside was kind

297
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,512
of wet, so it kind of sealed
off.

298
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,314
So we, uh... Yeah.

299
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,583
We got her off there.

300
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,953
Now he's putting a few extra
nails and just to be, just to be

301
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,790
safe and then, oh, now what he
did here was, he added, length

302
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,425
to the, to the stilts.

303
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:02,761
It was rope and duct tape, and
I think he went up about 12

304
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:05,831
feet. He says to me, "If you're
going to go up, you might as

305
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:10,235
well go up in a big way," which
I never really understood.

306
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,372
So he's gonna step onto these
from the van.

307
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:17,443
You know, whenever Bill gets
around my van, something bad

308
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,378
happens. I don't know what it
is.

309
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:20,479
Kind of a karma thing.

310
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:26,085
Or a truckma thing. Thank you,
Bill. And he gets up onto the

311
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:29,621
stilts there, and I'm sensing
impending doom.

312
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:33,092
I leave the area, but he's
doing OK.

313
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,760
Oh good, good.

314
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,497
He's all right, he's all right.
And unfortunately, what happens

315
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:45,871
a lot of times when you get up
that kind of height is the

316
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:46,972
gravity takes over.

317
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,143
But he's all right, he's OK.

318
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,811
He'll live to stilt another
day.

319
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:59,118
Go lie down, Bill.

320
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,856
It is summer

321
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:07,326
A muscle-bound bodybuilder kicks
sand in my face.

322
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,062
I challenge him to a fight.

323
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:14,666
Later that day, upon regaining
consciousness, I realize how

324
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,703
smart Gandhi was.

325
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:27,513
Well, the guys have heard that
Bob hates surprise parties, so

326
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,415
now they want to give them one
more now.

327
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,884
You know, since this is
unofficial April Fool's Day.

328
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,053
But I guess at tonight's
meeting, I better let the cat

329
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,087
out of the bag.

330
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,556
Well, you did that last week. Ha

331
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,391
That was a badger, Harold.

332
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,061
And I meant figuratively, this
time.

333
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,530
So I'll just, I'll just
announce that we're not going to

334
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,898
have a surprise party for Bob.

335
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,966
And then the guys will know
that they're, they're free and

336
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:51,503
clear to set his golf clubs on
fire or call his boss and tell

337
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,806
him how many rounds he plays on
company time.

338
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,641
Yeah. Bob will remember that.

339
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,177
Uncle Red. I mean, if this is
something you do to a fellow

340
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,412
lodge member, how are you
really any different than his

341
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,347
enemies, you know that's
what I do not understand

342
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:06,185
Well, the enemies would do it
with malice, Harold.

343
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,387
I mean, there'd be a mean edge
to the laughter.

344
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:09,721
We're just kidding around.

345
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,191
[a pig squeal]

346
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:15,194
That's the call to the meeting.
Oh, Uncle Red, it's time to go.

347
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,628
I hope you know what you're
doing.

348
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:20,732
No problem, Harold. I'll just
zip down there and let everybody

349
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:23,135
know what's going on and get
everything back on track.

350
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,404
And when the guys were trying
to do something nice for Bob,

351
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,840
then I'm sure they meant, well,
they just, just lost sight of

352
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,974
their priorities.

353
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:39,651
[pig squeal]

354
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:48,494
All rise!

355
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:55,434
[men recite the possum lodge
oath]

356
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,972
The floor recognizes Glen
Braxton.

357
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,574
Thank you, Red. I just want to
happily report that the army's

358
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:05,544
been serviced. It's all ready
to roll on our celebration that

359
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,080
we discussed. If my brother
possums will vote on my

360
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,049
suggestion, you know, as per...

361
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:15,053
Yes, well, I too am prepared.

362
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:19,091
Things have been cooked, plans
have been planted and I have

363
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,493
some supporters out there who
I'm sure we'll go along with

364
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,763
my...uh, uh...celebration
ideas.

365
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:31,470
I think I better announce to
everybody out there just for

366
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,106
your information and especially
to a couple or three guys up

367
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:37,543
here that the proposed
gathering has been

368
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,378
ixnayed.

369
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,052
Gatherings? Celebrations? What
are we talking about here, huh?

370
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:51,156
What are you guys up to? You're
not planning a surprise birthday

371
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:52,824
party for me, are you?

372
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,498
Really? Well, I hate surprise
birthday parties.

373
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,033
I told you that, didn't I Red?

374
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,335
Yes, you did, Bob. And that's
why we're not having one.

375
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:07,472
Whoah.

376
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,442
Oh. Well, all right, then.

377
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,745
It's not like I was expecting
one or anything like that.

378
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,049
They're always a
disappointment. You know.

379
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,352
I would imagine.

380
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,325
I lied about my
grandmother.

381
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:29,194
That's right, Red, I've never
had a party...

382
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,799
or had a grandmother.

383
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,867
Well, I canimagine what they're 

384
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:39,972
The parties, I mean, and all the
stupid balloons, crummy clowns,

385
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,640
lousy magicians.

386
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,912
Never, ever
had a corner piece of cake.

387
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,514
You know? The one with the
extra icing on it?

388
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,253
But my father used to say that
parties weren't dignified

389
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,223
and only middle-class people
had birthdays.

390
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,826
And then my mother, you know,
she hated the idea of growing

391
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:03,362
older, so she just drank
heavily.

392
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,866
We could never pin the tail on
anything.

393
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:16,008
Well, Bob...I wanted to have
you, have, throw you a party.

394
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,609
And so did Eddie.
Yeah.

395
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,677
But Red said no.

396
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:22,080
Red, Red, Red killed it.

397
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,917
All right, all right...just
about...hold on. Hold on.

398
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,020
Now Bob.

399
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,390
Were you or were you not
expecting a surprise party?

400
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,791
Be honest. Be honest.

401
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,294
No.

402
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:38,330
Well, OK. Yeah
A little one.

403
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,599
Just because
you're asking me all about the

404
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,200
parties and everything, Red.

405
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,404
And everyone else out there
wondering what size of golf

406
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,205
shoes I wore and stuff like
that.

407
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,640
So it's a bit of a giveaway.

408
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,875
I thought, you know, there'd
be a little thing.

409
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:53,245
All right, then. All right,
then. So, not having a surprise

410
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,547
party would be a surprise,
wouldn't it?

411
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,583
Well, I, I guess.

412
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:02,487
OK! That's a surprise. So, all
those in favor of giving Bob a

413
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,823
surprise on his birthday, say
"aye."

414
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,558
Aye!

415
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,393
Well, there you go, ah?

416
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:09,428
No party, it is!

417
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:11,263
Eh? All together now...

418
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,232
Surprise!

419
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,272
You're kidding me, right?

420
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:23,241
That's funny! That's very good!

421
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:25,544
No, no...

422
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:28,513
We're not kidding. That's it.
That's it.

423
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,983
Any other business there, Bill?

424
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:36,421
No? Oh, OK. So, why don't we
call in Eddie here to supply the

425
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:39,391
evening's entertainment?
Congratulations, Bob.

426
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,360
OK, Eddie.

427
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,328
Here we go. Eddie!

428
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:46,398
Eddie's, up. Eddie's up.
Please. Eddie's up.

429
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,806
Well, live and learn, live and
learn.

430
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:58,009
The guys thought they could
pull a prank on Bob by having a

431
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,112
party for him that would make
them feel awkward and

432
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:01,713
embarrassed, and everything.

433
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,815
I managed to do all that just by
telling them

434
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:06,184
there was going to be
a party.

435
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:11,156
Just with a few simple words, I
reduced a grown man to tears.
Now that's a prank.

436
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:14,092
And, you know, I guess the
ability to understand people and

437
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:16,361
what makes them tick is the
mark of a true leader.

438
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:19,164
Anyway, my wife is watching.

439
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:22,100
I'll be coming straight home
after the meeting and please

440
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,703
don't have any surprises for me
in bed tonight.

441
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:27,672
Or pranks. I certainly don't
have any for you.

442
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:31,243
So until next time, on behalf
of myself and Harold and the

443
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,778
whole gang up here at the
Lodge.

444
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,413
Keep your stick on the ice!

445
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,323
[singing] I saw her walking down
the meadow

446
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:48,860
[singing] a little dress on and
an attitude

447
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:54,833
[singing] I said, "Hey baby,
hey baby...it's you.

448
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:59,971
[singing] It's you.
Hey baby, it's you!"
