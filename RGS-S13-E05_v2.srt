1
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:05,705
You know, camping has come a long way since
Britney Spears threw me out of the house.

2
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:11,511
Nowadays, the fancy fold up hardtop units
that are kind of like a house except a little

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,480
smaller made out of canvas.

4
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:15,615
And they do about 70 miles an hour.

5
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,853
By golly, that's a lot of money to spend to
go away for the weekend and still find out

6
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,087
you've got a guy like me in the next
campsite.

7
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,891
And as usual, I got a better idea.

8
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:37,337
Pick one of the vehicles out of your
personal automotive parts department that you

9
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:38,371
keep behind your house.

10
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:41,975
Drop the engine out of her and convert it
into a hard top camper.

11
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:46,679
All you need is some camping gear, a couple
of old tents and a little imagination

12
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:50,450
That keeps the

13
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,721
Mosquitoes away. And the hood protects the
cook from the flying beer bottles that are so

14
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,656
much a part of any camping experience.

15
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:04,531
And look, how much extra space you get when
you rent out the doors using the handyman

16
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:10,737
secret hinge. There's your main living area.

17
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:23,950
That's your boudoir. The only real work you
have to do to set up a unit is to dig a hole

18
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,120
under the trunk, or, I should say, the
powder room.

19
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:55,515
Well, today is the big fishing trip for the
Lodge last when we went on was nine years

20
00:01:55,515 --> 00:02:00,386
ago, just a bunch of lies members out in the
wilderness doing whatever the heck we want.

21
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:05,124
That's why I believe the nine year gap, so
the statute of limitations will kick in.

22
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,961
Yeah, I'll come to you here.

23
00:02:09,695 --> 00:02:11,898
Yeah. All right.

24
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:14,600
And.

25
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,905
I'll just follow the bread crumbs, bread
crumbs.

26
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,041
Hey. Yeah, there you go.

27
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:24,143
Yeah, please help me off with this backpack.

28
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:27,313
Oh, sure. Yeah. Well, that's a big one.

29
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:28,548
Oh.

30
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,084
Thank you. Yeah.

31
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,453
Hey, Don. Cheers.

32
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:40,259
We had a French poodle that used to do that
to the wife's laundry.

33
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:43,262
We had to have him neutered.

34
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:46,833
Yeah, I think the same thing here would work.

35
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,436
Let's go fishing, boys.

36
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:57,677
I'm all packed up, got everything in the
waiters, I got my fishing gear, got the

37
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:03,249
hatchet clean shirt dip, net folding or even
stopped by a phone booth to pick up some

38
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:08,754
toilet paper. Right.

39
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,659
What's wrong, do I say something wrong?

40
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:17,597
Oh no, we're a little hard of hearing hearing
a hearing.

41
00:03:17,863 --> 00:03:20,299
That's just a maybe you should go pack
Winston.

42
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:26,939
I just told you, I've already packed these,
I'll see you guys down at the dock.

43
00:03:32,244 --> 00:03:33,779
Holy smokes.

44
00:03:33,946 --> 00:03:36,215
Clark, what Westerners wearing an earring?

45
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,617
Yeah, I don't think I want to share a tent
with him.

46
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,154
It's just any rain.

47
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,490
Funny. He never married, huh?

48
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,225
And he's always wearing those rubber pants.

49
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,467
It's time for

50
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,602
The Possum Lodge word game.

51
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:11,684
Mike Hammer will be playing for a free meal
from Honkin Joe's Cafe, recently reopened by

52
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,452
the Possum Lake Health Department.

53
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:18,924
Come try Hank and Joe's all you can eat
buffet now with sneeze guard.

54
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:21,460
Cover your ears there, Mike.

55
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:24,597
Fred, you've got 30 seconds to get my camera
to say this word.

56
00:04:25,364 --> 00:04:28,367
Party party.

57
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:30,469
All right. And go,

58
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:35,307
Ok, Mike. On your 18th birthday, what did
your parents

59
00:04:35,307 --> 00:04:37,376
Throw you out of the house?

60
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:43,249
Ok. Ok. What do you call it when your friends
have a get together in your honor?

61
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:45,017
An intervention?

62
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:50,623
Ok. Ok, if you have a wedding in your family,
what do you call those people who are

63
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,892
standing next to the bride and groom their
children?

64
00:04:57,496 --> 00:04:58,631
Ok. Ok.

65
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:02,601
This is a line that people sometimes get on
their phone.

66
00:05:04,236 --> 00:05:05,371
What are you wearing?

67
00:05:11,143 --> 00:05:11,844
Almost out of time

68
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:14,947
Here, right? I don't know, Mike, we may have
to cheat on this one.

69
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,515
Oh no, Mr.

70
00:05:16,515 --> 00:05:18,784
Green. That's something I can never be a
party to.

71
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:29,561
Most Thompson, a possum possibly calls it a
colossal achievement.

72
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:35,567
Wendy McClintock says this was truly a
moving experience and that weird lady who

73
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:40,339
lives in the shed at the edge of town with
all the birds says, Do I know you get off my

74
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:43,909
property? The critics agree.

75
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:49,248
If you get your skeptics pumped only once
this year, you're pressing your luck.

76
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:55,421
Rothchild sewage and septic sucking services
the only show in town.

77
00:05:58,824 --> 00:06:02,161
Now has a handy man, I get asked a lot of the
big questions in life.

78
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:03,762
What does it all mean?

79
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:05,097
Why are we here?

80
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,498
Why are you here?

81
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,133
No, really, sir. Why are you here?

82
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,268
You're not on the guest list.

83
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:11,603
And of course, the classic one.

84
00:06:11,937 --> 00:06:13,672
Why is there only beef jerky?

85
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:17,109
Couldn't some creative free thinker come up
with a little variety?

86
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:20,679
Well, yes, I can go today on Handymen
Corner.

87
00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:24,449
I'm going to show you how to make turkey
jerky.

88
00:06:26,885 --> 00:06:30,856
The first thing you want to do is dry the
bird, not the way your grandmother does it by

89
00:06:30,856 --> 00:06:34,793
roasting it in a four hundred degree oven
for the entire 12 days of Christmas.

90
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,497
No, no, that's not the way the creative
freethinker does it.

91
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,923
Ok, the next step in the process is to salt
the meat.

92
00:07:05,857 --> 00:07:10,495
Oh, sure, I think that and salt to the drier
cycle, but where's the fun in that?

93
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:25,010
The last step we need to make our turkey
jerky is to compress the dry salt and meat.

94
00:07:25,544 --> 00:07:30,482
I'm sure they sell machines made specially
for doing that, but I prefer to use this room

95
00:07:30,482 --> 00:07:35,087
divider that Bernie's got to stop me from
watching TV while we're eating dinner.

96
00:07:38,824 --> 00:07:42,761
The big question is, how much pressure is it
going to take to flatten this baby?

97
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:45,864
I'm guessing somewhere around 60 pounds.

98
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:51,870
Exactly 60 pounds.

99
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:16,161
And it's just that easy to remember the
women don't find you handsome.

100
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:17,729
They should at least find your handy.

101
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:43,321
Yesterday, it ran into an old friend of
mine.

102
00:08:43,588 --> 00:08:44,789
I haven't seen in years.

103
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,727
I asked him how he was doing and he said
everything was great.

104
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,896
His family's great, his health was great, his
job is great.

105
00:08:52,364 --> 00:08:53,865
Well, great. Great, great.

106
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,838
Oh, sure, I mean, I'm happy he's alive, and
I probably don't mean him any real harm, but

107
00:09:00,405 --> 00:09:05,210
you know, the bottom line is most men don't
want to hear everything's great.

108
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:10,215
On the phrase everything's great is an
instant conversation ender.

109
00:09:10,715 --> 00:09:13,184
Just like the phrase, I'm a police officer.

110
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:19,491
I mean, you know, when somebody says
everything's great, well, the only answer you

111
00:09:19,491 --> 00:09:22,127
can give them is great, you know?

112
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:26,598
Then force a smile like Liza Minnelli on her
wedding night.

113
00:09:27,432 --> 00:09:33,037
Well, I mean, what I want to hear, I want
the guy to say, Well, everything's OK.

114
00:09:33,037 --> 00:09:37,909
You know, his boss is on his case and his
wife is on sabbatical and maybe his.

115
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,845
His car is on fire or something like that.

116
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:48,086
And his daughter just had her navel pierced,
you know, which is not so bad, except that

117
00:09:48,153 --> 00:09:49,988
his daughter's name used to be frank.

118
00:09:50,321 --> 00:09:57,228
You know? Well, well, now you're talking,
you know, because see that stuff that just

119
00:09:57,228 --> 00:10:00,532
opens the door now I can tell them
everything that's wrong with my life.

120
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:05,270
And before you know it, we're exchanging a
few laughs and a little bit of advice, and we

121
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:09,641
both go away feeling better about ourselves
because we're thinking the other guy has got

122
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:15,180
it worse off than I. So it's like that old
saying, if you haven't got anything nice to

123
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,714
say, great.

124
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:19,250
Remember, I'm pulling for you.

125
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:20,718
We're all in this together.

126
00:10:24,222 --> 00:10:28,927
I'm not just the president of Rothchild
sewage and septic sucking services, I'm also

127
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:38,369
a client. Ok, I'll correct.

128
00:10:38,803 --> 00:10:40,271
This is the last of my luggage.

129
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:45,009
Are you sure this fishing trip something in
the last five days?

130
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:46,811
Oh yeah, yeah, that's it, Harold.

131
00:10:46,811 --> 00:10:47,845
It's five days maximum

132
00:10:48,212 --> 00:10:49,280
Back from the hurricane.

133
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:59,057
Very funny. Is this supposed to accomplish?

134
00:10:59,457 --> 00:11:01,025
Wait, it's just an earring.

135
00:11:02,126 --> 00:11:05,530
We just want to show Winston how weird an
earring makes him look.

136
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,398
I mean, this is an act of love.

137
00:11:07,465 --> 00:11:09,934
Yeah, yeah. Well, he just means man love.

138
00:11:10,334 --> 00:11:14,072
I mean, for a friendly man like, you know,
not that friendly.

139
00:11:14,072 --> 00:11:16,207
Just, Hey, I've got an idea.

140
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,676
Let's your Winston. How silly he looks.

141
00:11:18,743 --> 00:11:20,078
Look, I got lipstick.

142
00:11:20,111 --> 00:11:25,149
Oh, great. You know, Uncle Brad, if you're
uncomfortable around Winston, you know, as

143
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:29,220
someone who's afraid and insecure may well
be, why don't you just be up front and talk

144
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:29,720
to him?

145
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:32,490
Talk to Marilyn. Oh, jeez, I don't know.

146
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:43,601
I think it would be awful hard for us to
talk to them about it, yeah, I

147
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:45,803
Feel uncomfortable. You could be awkward for
sure.

148
00:11:47,338 --> 00:11:49,006
Hey, Richard, can you do me a favor?

149
00:11:49,006 --> 00:11:51,075
I don't want to pack these good lures in my
pants.

150
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:56,013
You can put them in here.

151
00:11:56,047 --> 00:12:01,252
There you go. I sure hope you boys have been
drinking.

152
00:12:05,656 --> 00:12:07,859
Well, I think Winston got the message and
that

153
00:12:10,628 --> 00:12:10,895
Was

154
00:12:10,895 --> 00:12:11,963
His face red.

155
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:21,205
So behind the lines with Sparky, they're just
throwing a stick, and he's kind of a.

156
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:24,475
He likes that, he likes just grabbing the
stick and he's very exuberant, he's very

157
00:12:24,475 --> 00:12:28,646
focused, very focused dog and just loves
that stick and Walter come along.

158
00:12:28,646 --> 00:12:30,581
And he had had some sticks of dynamite
there.

159
00:12:30,781 --> 00:12:32,717
I didn't know quite what was going.

160
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,353
I thought, this is probably not a good time
to be playing with the dog.

161
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:39,690
So I just threw that. I figured Sparky, just
go in there and just stay in the body.

162
00:12:39,724 --> 00:12:41,559
But he actually got the stick and brought it
over to me.

163
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:46,397
But the whole thing was Walter wanted to
remove a stump there, and

164
00:12:46,397 --> 00:12:48,199
Dynamite seemed like the quickest, easiest
way.

165
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:52,636
Sparky. This is not a good time, not a good
time to just ask you where you go, where you

166
00:12:52,636 --> 00:12:54,038
go. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

167
00:12:54,038 --> 00:12:59,210
Wiggle weaver. Ok, so Walter grabs a stick
there and he's going to stick her in behind.

168
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:04,782
I think it's probably safer to get all the
rest of dynamite out of the way, and I guess

169
00:13:04,782 --> 00:13:08,519
he'll wire it all up and then I'll go back
in and set it off.

170
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:14,158
I see the guy, OK, you got the plunger that
we're all all set up, and I'm sure he's just

171
00:13:14,158 --> 00:13:16,660
about done there. Just take your wires up
and get this thing on.

172
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,929
We just stick her in there wires and then
OK.

173
00:13:19,897 --> 00:13:24,068
And away we go. An odd sound from.

174
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:30,908
You know, I was kind of expecting more of a
bang than the than the slow hiss thing.

175
00:13:32,977 --> 00:13:34,779
Ok, she's hooked up to my back tire there.

176
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:41,519
I don't know completely it, so I'm going to
go back to the stump and see what the problem

177
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,754
is and wonder just what had happened here.

178
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:46,123
I think it was. It's a change in technology.

179
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,527
I don't see any wires on the dynamite enough
here where they must be buried and they got

180
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:51,695
disconnected somehow. And I'm looking for
the meanwhile.

181
00:13:51,729 --> 00:13:54,165
Apparently what they have is now is a
wireless detonator.

182
00:13:57,601 --> 00:13:58,736
Which I know about now.

183
00:14:03,374 --> 00:14:05,009
So we try to try again.

184
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:06,744
The one stick apparently wasn't enough.

185
00:14:07,111 --> 00:14:09,480
Put a few sticks in, but I'd forgotten that
the dog.

186
00:14:11,181 --> 00:14:16,186
Still don't, and that's I was in the
doghouse, and then I think this is probably

187
00:14:16,186 --> 00:14:17,388
our second stick there and.

188
00:14:20,557 --> 00:14:24,328
And Hassan seemed to have something against
that tree.

189
00:14:24,361 --> 00:14:26,830
I don't know. And now we got three sticks of
dynamite.

190
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:30,200
Ok, now that makes sense.

191
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:33,804
And now we're all set, we while three sticks
of dynamite, we should

192
00:14:34,204 --> 00:14:35,706
Get rid of that stump, no problem.

193
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:40,511
So Walter presses the button and what
happens is roughly nothing.

194
00:14:41,512 --> 00:14:42,780
So he presses a few more times.

195
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:50,054
That stuff does. And that one went not real
good, and you'll never guess.

196
00:14:56,927 --> 00:14:57,961
That's what we call it, mission
accomplished.

197
00:14:59,763 --> 00:15:03,300
Ok, here comes a stick of dynamite and a dog
named Sparky, I'm out of here.

198
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:15,145
This is the experts portion of the show where
we addressed those three little words that

199
00:15:15,145 --> 00:15:20,884
men find so hard to say, Oh OK.

200
00:15:21,452 --> 00:15:24,588
And here's your letter, dear experts.

201
00:15:24,822 --> 00:15:26,790
Men don't share.

202
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,493
Men don't allow feelings out.

203
00:15:29,626 --> 00:15:32,062
Men don't talk about what matters.

204
00:15:32,229 --> 00:15:34,731
And that's what makes us men so happy.

205
00:15:35,966 --> 00:15:38,735
Why aren't women more like us sincerely?

206
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:40,671
Well, my theory is that they just love to
talk.

207
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:43,473
Yeah, as I've said on many occasions.

208
00:15:43,907 --> 00:15:45,142
Well, that maybe that's the way it is.

209
00:15:45,142 --> 00:15:45,442
Read.

210
00:15:46,543 --> 00:15:52,916
I'm talking home. See, women don't understand
sports or cars or machinery, so what else do

211
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,851
they have to talk about, just their
feelings?

212
00:15:57,187 --> 00:16:01,091
I'll see now. My theory is women talk more
about the feelings because they have more of

213
00:16:01,091 --> 00:16:03,827
them, you know, I mean, you ask any of us
guys how we're feeling.

214
00:16:04,127 --> 00:16:05,195
We're all feeling fine.

215
00:16:05,195 --> 00:16:08,131
But a woman only Michael, there's so many
shades of.

216
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,437
And then they're like, say, Mike, they see
that that kind of gas or what color would you

217
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:15,539
say that is this way?

218
00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:18,275
Ok? Color colors that chair dread.

219
00:16:18,308 --> 00:16:21,211
Yeah. Ok, Mike Landon, it's red.

220
00:16:21,211 --> 00:16:22,546
It's Ray. Exactly.

221
00:16:22,546 --> 00:16:27,050
Like to us, it's red. Ok, but bernie's that
there is ruby crimson over here.

222
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,485
We got tropical coral and.

223
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:32,389
This unit would be wisp of tomato.

224
00:16:34,524 --> 00:16:36,727
You know, women know all the shades.

225
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:41,598
Yeah, men are emotionally colorblind, so I
think that's it.

226
00:16:41,665 --> 00:16:42,666
That's it. Exactly.

227
00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:44,968
You know, it must be awful having all those
feelings.

228
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:48,405
She says it that they got so many feelings
there.

229
00:16:48,672 --> 00:16:50,040
I'm afraid they're going to explode.

230
00:16:50,874 --> 00:16:55,112
And that's why you're messing is just listen
to a woman while she talks about her feelings

231
00:16:55,112 --> 00:16:56,913
and be darn thankful that you're a guy.

232
00:16:58,615 --> 00:16:59,616
Now, what do you do if you won?

233
00:16:59,716 --> 00:17:01,451
They want you to share your feelings with
them.

234
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:04,721
You have to make up stuff.

235
00:17:07,524 --> 00:17:15,031
This kind of talk talks, talk slow and take
a lot of deep.

236
00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:21,037
Wow, you almost teared up there.

237
00:17:21,071 --> 00:17:21,771
How do you do that?

238
00:17:22,806 --> 00:17:24,941
Well, it helps if you sit on some ice tongs.

239
00:17:48,598 --> 00:17:53,470
You ever noticed that a lot of the heavy
construction equipment has these stabilizing

240
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,940
feet to go right down to the ground, stop
the unit from tipping over?

241
00:17:57,274 --> 00:18:00,810
Some of them are strong enough to actually
lift a unit up into the air.

242
00:18:01,278 --> 00:18:04,781
But I'm thinking, you know, something like
this could be really useful in a roadside

243
00:18:04,781 --> 00:18:14,090
emergency. Had to adapt her a little to fit
my wheel studs, but we made it work.

244
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:19,195
He, of course, is to mount the foot upside
down on there.

245
00:18:20,597 --> 00:18:22,365
I'll take her off once I'm out of the danger
zone.

246
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:39,049
Well, we put off our fishing trip until
tomorrow, and we asked Winston the so we can

247
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:41,518
have a little chat with him about his
alternate lifestyle.

248
00:18:43,453 --> 00:18:46,189
You know, it's getting pretty serious when
men have to talk to each other.

249
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:50,593
Ok, I'm here. Please sit down.

250
00:18:50,794 --> 00:18:53,930
Ok. Wow.

251
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:57,801
You know, something I really like what you
guys have done with this place.

252
00:19:01,871 --> 00:19:05,875
Winston Reid and I have asked you here to
just to talk and a few things out in the

253
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:10,680
open. Good because it's kind of been
bothering me too.

254
00:19:11,548 --> 00:19:16,386
How good is that? Yeah, you know, it sort of
threw me for a loop at first, but I think

255
00:19:16,386 --> 00:19:17,720
I've got my head around it now.

256
00:19:17,954 --> 00:19:21,324
Mm hmm. I'm just a little sad that you've
been so secretive about it, read.

257
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,459
It doesn't bother me that you're gay.

258
00:19:26,462 --> 00:19:28,231
Pardon me. Oh, come

259
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:30,099
On. You know, lodge leader.

260
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,901
All male members.

261
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:34,837
You see, you got a wife, but no one's ever
seen her.

262
00:19:34,871 --> 00:19:36,806
Yeah, yeah.

263
00:19:38,274 --> 00:19:39,576
No, but but look, let's let's let's listen.

264
00:19:40,043 --> 00:19:42,278
It doesn't matter, we're all on the same
team here.

265
00:19:42,412 --> 00:19:45,214
Ok. It's just that you.

266
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:47,383
That from the other side of the plate.

267
00:19:48,785 --> 00:19:50,320
I know you're in the Situation Room with us
tonight.

268
00:19:50,687 --> 00:19:52,789
Come on. You're the one with the earring.

269
00:19:52,889 --> 00:19:55,124
Hey. Yeah.

270
00:20:00,063 --> 00:20:03,232
Oh, no. Ok, I remember this isn't an earring.

271
00:20:03,266 --> 00:20:08,104
No, no. About a week ago, I was doing this
septic job right, and this little girl had

272
00:20:08,104 --> 00:20:11,140
accidentally flushed her glitter pony doll
down the toilet, right?

273
00:20:11,574 --> 00:20:17,080
Well, when when the back pressure from the
septic truck hit this thing, it was bits of

274
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,915
glitter pony doll everywhere.

275
00:20:20,283 --> 00:20:24,087
Oh, I see said I'm a little disappointed,
though, that you'd assume that I would wear

276
00:20:24,087 --> 00:20:24,620
an earring.

277
00:20:25,488 --> 00:20:26,589
Oh, you know, you're right.

278
00:20:26,589 --> 00:20:29,959
I mean, I should have known it was a glitter
pony that got caught in a toilet explosion.

279
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:34,897
Well, you see how talking to each other is
always the best way, yeah,

280
00:20:35,264 --> 00:20:38,167
Yeah, you know what, Winston? Just a little
harmless misunderstanding.

281
00:20:38,434 --> 00:20:39,469
Yeah, I don't. Don't worry.

282
00:20:39,602 --> 00:20:40,336
No, I'm good. I mean,

283
00:20:40,336 --> 00:20:41,804
I thought you were the gay one, right?

284
00:20:45,408 --> 00:20:51,614
But listen, if if you ever muster up the
courage to talk about it, I'm here for you.

285
00:20:54,684 --> 00:20:58,254
Free meeting time can take him with you and
Harold, please.

286
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:07,864
Ok. My wife is watching, I'll be coming
straight home after the meeting, and we had

287
00:21:07,864 --> 00:21:10,099
some questions about my orientation today.

288
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,268
I'm hoping we can get some answers tonight.

289
00:21:13,636 --> 00:21:15,271
And thanks for watching.

290
00:21:15,304 --> 00:21:19,475
On behalf of myself and Harold and the whole
gang up here for watch people stick on.

291
00:21:23,212 --> 00:21:31,187
We raised it all rise quite

292
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:34,223
smartly now.

293
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,927
Hey, now your heads for the man's prayer.

294
00:21:38,928 --> 00:21:43,866
I'm a man, but I can change if I have to, I
guess,

295
00:21:46,102 --> 00:21:48,504
But I don't ever plan on changing that much.
