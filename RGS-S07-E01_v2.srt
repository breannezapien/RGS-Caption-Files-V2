1
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:11,578
IT'S THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW!

2
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:12,879
(APPLAUSE)

3
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:15,081
AND NOW, HERE'S THE JULIUS
CAESAR OF POSSUM LODGE.

4
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,050
HE CAME; HE SAW;
HE COCKED OUT.

5
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:20,186
YOUR HERO, MY UNCLE,
RED GREEN!

6
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:23,656
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

7
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:26,760
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.

8
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:28,928
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I APPRECIATE IT.

9
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:31,531
APPRECIATE IT.
WELCOME TO POSSUM LODGE.

10
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:32,766
BOY, OH, BOY.

11
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:34,400
BIG, BIG, WEEK AT THE
LODGE THIS WEEK.

12
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:36,402
GOT A REAL SPECIAL
EVENT PLANNED.

13
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:41,441
OUR VERY FIRST EVER
RUNNING OF THE BULLS.

14
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,343
YEAH, WE ALL GOT A TOUCH
OF THE POMPLONA.

15
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:45,245
YEAH, I HAD THAT ONE TIME.

16
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:48,314
COUPLE OF SPOON FULLS OF IMODIUM
AND KEEP YOUR RUNNING SHOES ON.

17
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:52,652
NO, UNCLE RED, POMPLONA IS A
CITY IN SPAIN WHERE THEY HAVE
THE REAL RUNNING OF THE BULLS.

18
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,220
OH, YEAH.
I KNOW.

19
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:56,189
BUT OURS WILL BE JUST
AS GOOD, HAROLD.

20
00:00:56,256 --> 00:01:00,493
BOY, I TELL YOU, THE IDEA OF A
BUNCH OF BULLS CHASING OUR
GUYS DOWN THE MAIN STREET

21
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,396
HAS EVERYBODY PRETTY
REVVED UP AROUND HERE.

22
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,365
YOU KNOW, IT SOUNDS PRETTY
DANGEROUS TO ME.

23
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:07,800
YOU KNOW, IF ANYBODY GETS
HURT, YOUR NAME IS MUD.

24
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:12,438
HAROLD, WHEN I'M BEING CHASED BY
AN ANGRY BULL, I'LL TAKE ANY
NAME BUT GORD.

25
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:15,241
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

26
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:29,522
[QUIRKY UPBEAT MUSIC]

27
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,058
HERE ARE A FEW CLIPS
FROM THIS EPISODE.

28
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:35,028
HAROLD TELLS ME THIS IS WHAT
THE BIG SHOWS DO NOW, YOU KNOW,
TO GET YOU TO WATCH.

29
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:37,163
KIND OF A PREVIEW, KIND OF A
TEASER KIND OF THING.

30
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,564
HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?

31
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:42,435
LET US KNOW.
CALL 1-800-NICE-TRY.

32
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,344
WELL, GOT AN HOUR TO GO UNTIL
THE TEST RUN OF THE RUNNING OF
THE BULLS.

33
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,180
I GUESS YOU COULD CALL THAT THE
TEST RUNNING OF THE BULLS.

34
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,215
UNCLE RED, HAVE YOU
THOUGHT THIS THROUGH?

35
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,184
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

36
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,085
NOTHING.
NEVER MIND.

37
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,988
STUPID QUESTION.

38
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,757
WELL, WE GOT OUR TWO BULLS, AND
THEY'RE READY TO GO.

39
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:10,329
SO ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS THROW
ON OUR RUNNING SHOES AND
START YELLING OY VEY.

40
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:12,165
I THINK YOU
MEAN OLE.

41
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:17,370
NO, THESE BULLS
ARE KOSHER.

42
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,238
AND, BOY, THEY'RE BIG, YOU KNOW.

43
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,574
AND, BOY, THEY'RE MEAN
LOOKING, HAROLD.

44
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:25,845
AND I DON'T THINK THEY'VE BEEN
ON A DATE FOR A WHILE IF YOU
KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

45
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:29,115
AND I'M SURE YOU DO.

46
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,718
UNCLE RED, YOU'RE JUST GOING TO
GET SO TERRIBLY HURT.

47
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:35,788
DO YOU ACTUALLY THINK YOU CAN
OUTRUN AN ANGRY, CHARGING BULL?

48
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,256
I DON'T HAVE TO, HAROLD.

49
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:40,960
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS OUTRUN AT
LEAST ONE LODGE MEMBER.

50
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:44,530
(APPLAUSE)

51
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:48,000
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

52
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:51,070
I THINK YOU SHOULD WORRY
ABOUT OLD MAN SEDGEWICK.

53
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,405
OR BUSTER HATFIELD.

54
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:54,740
OH, YEAH, HE'S NO
DONOVAN BAILEY.

55
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:57,410
MORE LIKE BEETLE BAILEY.

56
00:02:57,476 --> 00:02:59,779
AND FOR SURE I CAN
OUTRUN YOU.

57
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:01,380
I'M NOT PARTICIPATING.

58
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,749
THIS IS A POTENTIALLY
DANGEROUS EVENT.

59
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:05,885
I KNOW.

60
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,321
IT'S NOT AS FULFILLING AS
SITTING AT THE COMPUTER FOR SIX
HOURS ON THE INTERNET

61
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:12,091
ARGUING ABOUT WHETHER
CAPTAIN KIRK IS BETTER THAN
CAPTAIN PICKARD.

62
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,661
PICKARD, PICKARD,
PICKARDING.

63
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,697
BUT FOR THE GUYS WHO ARE
RUNNING WITH THE BULLS,

64
00:03:17,763 --> 00:03:24,103
HAROLD, THIS IS A DISPLAY OF
COURAGE, MANHOOD, AND HEART.

65
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,341
AND HEART ATTACKS.

66
00:03:29,241 --> 00:03:32,078
OH YOUR KITE GOT CAUGHT
IN A HIGH-TENSION WIRE

67
00:03:32,144 --> 00:03:34,313
YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD
GET IT DOWN

68
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,283
SO YOU LEAN YOUR LADDER
UP AGAINST THE POLE

69
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,086
AND YOU HEARD A FUNNY SOUND

70
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:42,788
YOU CLIMBED AND CLIMBED,
WAY UP TO THE TOP

71
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:45,491
WHERE THE LADDER TOUCHED
THE TRANSFORMER

72
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,993
YOU GRABBED THE WIRE
TO FREE YOUR KITE

73
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,596
AND YOU NOTICED YOUR HAND
GETTING WARMER

74
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:54,900
OH, SPARKS FLEW OUT
AND AWAY YOU WENT

75
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:57,770
WITH ONE ARM NOTICEABLY
ENLARGED

76
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:00,172
NOW NORMALLY THE COPS WOULD
MAKE AN ARREST

77
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,642
BUT THEY COULD SEE YOU'VE
ALREADY BEEN CHARGED

78
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:15,754
GOT A REAL COMPLICATED HANDYMAN
PROJECT ON THIS WEEK'S SHOW.

79
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:19,758
AS YOU CAN SEE, THIS VEHICLE
HERE HAS HAD A LITTLE
UNSCHEDULED BODY WORK ON HER.

80
00:04:19,825 --> 00:04:22,461
AND SHE'S KIND OF UNSAFE
AND UGLY RIGHT NOW,

81
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:26,298
WHICH IS A LOT MORE ACCEPTABLE
IN A PERSON THAN IT IS IN A CAR.

82
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:30,803
AND OVER HERE, IF YOU SEE,
WE HAVE ALMOST THE IDENTICAL
UNIT OVER HERE

83
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,272
AND DIFFERENT SIDE DONE
ON THIS ONE.

84
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,274
THIS IS ACTUALLY THE RESULT OF A
LITTLE TEST WE RAN UP

85
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:38,744
TO SEE IF MERCURY CREEK BRIDGE
WAS WIDE ENOUGH FOR TWO CARS.

86
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,914
CAN'T REALLY TALK ABOUT THAT ANY
MORE UNTIL AFTER THE INQUEST.

87
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:44,583
ANYWAY, I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU
WHAT THE CREATIVE HANDYMAN DOES

88
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,920
WHEN HE'S GOT TWO IDENTICAL
SIDESWIPED VEHICLES.

89
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,656
ACTUALLY, I GOT THE IDEA
WATCHING THEM ACTION MOVIES.

90
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:55,094
I REALLY LIKE THE ACTION MOVIES
BECAUSE AT MY AGE IT'S ABOUT ALL
THE ACTION I'M GOING TO SEE.

91
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,463
LET ME SHOW YOU HOW
TO MAKE A HUMMER.

92
00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:58,864
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE HUMMER IS?

93
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,233
ONE OF THOSE THINGS THEY USE,
LIKE, ON DESERT STORM.

94
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,068
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY
CALL IT A HUMMER,

95
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:07,439
BUT IF YOU'VE GOT ANYTHING
THAT'S 12 FEET WIDE, IT'S A
HUMMER, BELIEVE ME.

96
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:10,342
YOU KNOW WHO HAS THEM IS THE
MILITARY AND HOLLYWOOD
CELEBRITIES.

97
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:14,179
THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE THOSE
ARE TWO GROUPS THAT REALLY SPEND
MONEY WISELY.

98
00:05:14,246 --> 00:05:18,584
SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS
CONNECT THESE TWO CARS
TOGETHER SIDE BY SIDE.

99
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:22,721
AND, OF COURSE, FIRST THING THAT
WE'VE GOT TO DO IS GET THE
DOORS OFF OF THEM.

100
00:05:22,788 --> 00:05:24,256
HALF INCH BOLT?

101
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:26,425
NO, I THINK SHE'S A 5/8TH.

102
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:47,246
KIND OF REMIND YOU OF A ROCKER,
DOESN'T IT?

103
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:49,715
THE DOORS.

104
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,216
THEY BROKE UP!

105
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:52,918
ALL RIGHT.

106
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:57,523
NOW ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS DRIVE
THIS CAR UP SO THE TWO CARS ARE
SIDE BY SIDE.

107
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,929
THERE WE GO.

108
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:07,499
NOW, YOU JUST KIND OF GOT
TO JOIN THEM TOGETHER
INTO ONE WIDE BODY,

109
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:11,637
AND, OF COURSE, JOINING THEM UP
MEANS THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU'VE
GOT TO BE WELDING

110
00:06:11,703 --> 00:06:17,943
OR BETTER STILL -- OR AT LEAST
FASTER STILL, USE THE HANDYMAN'S
SECRET, DUCT TAPE.

111
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,346
BUT DON'T SKIMP ON THE DUCT TAPE
JUST TO SAVE A BUCK OR TWO

112
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:27,219
BECAUSE AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS,
YOU'LL BE GLAD THAT YOU SPENT
THE BIG DOLLAR.

113
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:28,687
NO WONDER HUMMERS COST SO MUCH.

114
00:06:28,754 --> 00:06:30,789
IT'S ALL THE DUCT TAPE!

115
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:36,128
YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING, HOW'S
THIS GOING TO WORK?

116
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,396
WELL, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU.

117
00:06:37,462 --> 00:06:39,731
FIRST OF ALL, YOU START
UP THIS UNIT.

118
00:06:39,798 --> 00:06:40,999
YOU LEAVE HER IN NEUTRAL.

119
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:42,367
SAVES GAS.

120
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:43,869
WHAT ABOUT STEERING YOU'RE
THINKING?

121
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,170
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

122
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:47,339
I DUCT TAPED THE FRONT
WHEELS TOGETHER.

123
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:48,974
THIS IS NOT JUST A HUMMER.

124
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,776
IT'S A HUMMER DINGER.

125
00:06:50,842 --> 00:06:54,546
SEATS TEN, GOT TWO SEPARATE
HEATERS, TWO SEPARATE RADIOS

126
00:06:54,613 --> 00:06:57,649
SO THAT YOU DON'T GET INTO THE
ARGUMENTS OVER WHICH STATIONS
YOU'RE LISTENING TO.

127
00:06:57,716 --> 00:07:00,218
ANYBODY CAN HAVE A STRETCH LIMO.

128
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:02,020
WE'VE GOT A SQUAT LIMO.

129
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:05,123
I DIDN'T STRETCH THE BUDGET.
I DIDN'T PAY SQUAT!

130
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,326
LET'S SEE HOW SHE HANDLES.

131
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:14,232
REMEMBER, IF WOMEN DON'T FIND
YOU HANDSOME, THEY SHOULD AT
LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

132
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:16,468
I'LL BE BACK.

133
00:07:30,515 --> 00:07:34,453
AS TO WHY RELATIONSHIPS
ARE SO DIFFICULT.

134
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:37,322
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY IT'S BAD
TO GENERALIZE,

135
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:41,893
BUT IT'S SOMETHING
I REALLY ENJOY.

136
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,464
SO HERE'S THE THING, OKAY?

137
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:50,035
MEN ARE INTERESTED IN CARS;
WOMEN ARE INTERESTED IN
GARDENING.

138
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:52,838
YEAH.
THINK ABOUT THAT.

139
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:55,974
I MEAN, NOT ALL MEN LIKE
CARS, SOME LIKE MOTORCYCLES
AND TRUCKS.

140
00:07:56,041 --> 00:08:00,045
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO ADMIT, YOU SEE
MORE MEN AT CAR SHOWS,

141
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:04,382
AND YOU SEE MORE WOMEN AT
GARDENING SHOWS, EH?

142
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:05,984
THAT'S IMPORTANT.

143
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:08,353
THAT WILL HELP YOU UNDERSTAND
WHY THEY SEE RELATIONSHIPS
DIFFERENTLY.

144
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,090
SEE, BECAUSE WOMEN SEE YOUR
RELATIONSHIP LIKE A GARDEN.

145
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:14,392
YOU'VE GOT TO PUT A LOT
OF WORK INTO IT.

146
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:16,228
YOU'VE GOT TO FUSS OVER IT.

147
00:08:16,294 --> 00:08:18,830
YOU'VE GOT TO TURN OVER THE
GROUND, ADD MORE FLOWERS, A
LITTLE FERTILIZER;

148
00:08:18,897 --> 00:08:22,901
WHEREAS MEN SEE A RELATIONSHIP
LIKE A CAR,

149
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:25,136
ONCE THEY'VE MADE A COMMITMENT
TO HAVE ONE,

150
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:29,641
THEY REALLY EXPECT IT TO GO AT
LEAST FIVE YEARS WITHOUT ANY
SERIOUS MAINTENANCE.

151
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,344
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

152
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:36,581
OH, YEAH!

153
00:08:36,648 --> 00:08:40,352
SEE, WOMEN ENJOY WORKING
ON A RELATIONSHIP.

154
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:42,554
THEY SEE THAT AS PART
OF THE FUN.

155
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:48,893
MEN SEE THAT AS A SIGN
THAT THERE'S SOME SERIOUS
MECHANICAL PROBLEM.

156
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,596
AND MAYBE THAT'S WHY WHEN THERE
IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM,

157
00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:56,267
WOMEN TRY TO DIG DOWN DEEPER AND
GET TO THE ROOTS;

158
00:08:56,334 --> 00:09:02,173
WHEREAS, UNFORTUNATELY, A LOT OF
MEN TRY TO TRADE UP.

159
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,042
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

160
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:05,543
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

161
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:10,281
(APPLAUSE)

162
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:18,256
MAN, YOU TAKE A SIMPLE IDEA LIKE
A COUPLE OF BULLS CHASING PEOPLE
DOWN THE MAIN STREET,

163
00:09:18,323 --> 00:09:22,827
AND YOU THINK TO YOURSELF, WHAT
COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG?

164
00:09:22,894 --> 00:09:46,317
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

165
00:09:46,384 --> 00:09:50,321
YOU HAVE NO INTEREST IN
GIRLS, DO YOU, HAROLD?

166
00:09:50,388 --> 00:09:52,524
I'M NOT DRESSED LIKE
THIS TO IMPRESS GIRLS.

167
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,493
WELL, IT'S WORKING,
BELIEVE ME.

168
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,165
I'M GOING TO BE OFFICIATING
THE BIG EVENT, THE RUNNING
OF THE BULLS.

169
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:01,900
NO, HAROLD, THERE WON'T BE A
RUNNING OF THE BULLS.

170
00:10:01,966 --> 00:10:03,835
WE'VE HAD A FEW PROBLEMS.

171
00:10:03,902 --> 00:10:05,937
WHAT KIND OF PROBLEMS?

172
00:10:06,004 --> 00:10:08,106
WELL, DURING THE TEST RUN,

173
00:10:08,173 --> 00:10:15,079
WE FOUND OUT THAT JUNIOR
SINGLETON'S STARTER PISTOL
IS NOT A STARTER PISTOL.

174
00:10:15,146 --> 00:10:20,184
SO RIGHT AWAY WE'RE
DOWN TO ONE BULL.

175
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:21,653
A PROBLEM.

176
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:23,721
AND WE GOT HER GOING, THOUGH,
WITH THE ONE BULL,

177
00:10:23,788 --> 00:10:25,490
AND IT WAS CHASING EVERYBODY
PRETTY GOOD.

178
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:30,628
AND THEN MOOSE THOMPSON
DECIDED HE WANTS TO DOUBLE
BACK FOR HIS LUCKY HAT.

179
00:10:30,695 --> 00:10:32,297
HE RAN STRAIGHT INTO THE BULL?

180
00:10:32,363 --> 00:10:34,666
NO, HE CUT AROUND THE
SIDE STREET THERE,

181
00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:38,536
BUT HE STILL NAILED THE
BULL PRETTY GOOD.

182
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:40,071
LIKE HEAD-ON?

183
00:10:40,138 --> 00:10:42,440
MORE OF A T-BONE.

184
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:47,078
ACTUALLY 40 T-BONES, A MONSTER
RUMP ROAST, AND 900 POUNDS
OF HAMBURGER.

185
00:10:47,145 --> 00:10:48,613
OH, UNCLE, THAT'S AWFUL.

186
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,648
POOR LITTLE BIG BULL.

187
00:10:50,715 --> 00:10:52,350
THAT'S AWFUL.

188
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:53,751
WELL, GOOD, THERE'S AN UPSIDE.
THERE'S AN UPSIDE.

189
00:10:53,818 --> 00:10:56,187
THIS WHOLE SILLY EVENT
HAS TO BE CANCELED.

190
00:10:56,254 --> 00:10:58,823
NO, NO, NO.
WE'RE NOT GOING
TO CANCEL IT.

191
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,959
WE'RE JUST GOING TO FIND
SOMETHING ELSE TO RUN.

192
00:11:02,026 --> 00:11:03,461
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE
RUNNING OF THE MOOSE.

193
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:05,263
I'M GOING TO GO TELL MOOSE
ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.

194
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,298
HE'LL BE CONSCIOUS RIGHT NOW.

195
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:09,133
HOW CAN YOU TELL?

196
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,301
I'LL TELL HIM YOU
SAID THAT, HAROLD.

197
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:12,336
DON'T!
DON'T TELL HIM I SAID THAT.

198
00:11:12,403 --> 00:11:14,205
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT
PORTION OF THIS SHOW

199
00:11:14,272 --> 00:11:17,642
WHERE WE EXAMINE THOSE THREE
LITTLE WORDS THAT MEN FIND
SO HARD TO SAY...

200
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:19,711
CROWD:  I DON'T KNOW.

201
00:11:19,777 --> 00:11:21,412
EXCELLENT.

202
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:25,116
ON THIS WEEK'S PORTION OF
THE EXPERTS, WE HAVE, JOINING
MY UNCLE RED,

203
00:11:25,183 --> 00:11:29,587
IS HIS BEST FRIEND IN THE WHOLE
WIDE ROOM, MR. HAP SHAUGHNESSY.

204
00:11:29,654 --> 00:11:34,592
(APPLAUSE)

205
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:40,098
HEY, THIS WEEK'S LETTER GOES
AS FOLLOWS: "DEAR EXPERTS,

206
00:11:40,164 --> 00:11:43,334
"SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE IN
LIFE AFTER DEATH AND
SOME PEOPLE DON'T.

207
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:45,303
"WHO'S RIGHT?

208
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:52,009
"I'VE SEEN YOUR SHOW, AND I'M
SURE YOU GUYS MUST KNOW WHAT
HAPPENS AFTER YOU DIE."

209
00:11:52,076 --> 00:11:55,646
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IN
THEIR RIGHT MIND CAN ANSWER
THAT QUESTION.

210
00:11:55,713 --> 00:12:00,484
I CAN.

211
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,889
YOU DIED, MR. SHAUGHNESSY?
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?

212
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:08,759
AT THE SEOUL OLYMPICS
IN '88.

213
00:12:08,826 --> 00:12:12,797
I RAN THE MARATHON REPRESENTING
THE NATION OF SIERRA LEONE.

214
00:12:12,864 --> 00:12:18,970
DURING THE MARATHON, I DIED
OF A HEART ATTACK AT THE
52-MILE MARK.

215
00:12:21,505 --> 00:12:23,774
MARATHONS ARE ONLY
26 MILES.

216
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:29,080
NO ONE TOLD ME THAT.

217
00:12:29,146 --> 00:12:32,149
I THOUGHT YOU HAD TO
RUN THERE AND BACK!

218
00:12:32,216 --> 00:12:34,218
SO JUST AS I REACH WHAT I
THOUGHT WAS THE FINISH LINE,

219
00:12:34,285 --> 00:12:36,053
WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE THE
STARTING LINE AGAIN,

220
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,857
I COLLAPSED OF A HEART
ATTACK AND I DIED.

221
00:12:39,924 --> 00:12:43,094
WELL, I SAY WE HAVE A FUNERAL
IMMEDIATELY.

222
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,965
ANYWAY, MY SPIRIT OR MY SOUL
OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO
CALL IT WAS FLOATING.

223
00:12:48,032 --> 00:12:49,767
I COULD SEE I WAS LYING THERE.

224
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:55,339
OH, EVERYBODY CAN SEE YOU'RE
LYING THERE.

225
00:12:55,406 --> 00:12:57,742
I REMEMBER A BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN, AND I WAS WORKING
ON SOME POTTERY.

226
00:12:57,808 --> 00:12:59,577
AND I REMEMBER A DOOR AND A
PENNY SLIDING ON THE DOOR.

227
00:12:59,643 --> 00:13:03,514
AND THAT'S ALL I REMEMBER ABOUT
THE AFTERLIFE.

228
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:09,153
THEN A DOCTOR REVIVED ME, AND I
WAS BACK ON EARTH IN KOREA.

229
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,190
I WAS SO EXCITED I TREATED
EVERYONE TO A BANQUET OF DOG.

230
00:13:13,257 --> 00:13:18,462
THAT'S A KOREAN DELICACY.
TASTES A LOT LIKE WOLF.

231
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:21,198
JUST COMING BACK A LITTLE BIT TO
YOUR MEMORIES OF THE AFTERLIFE,

232
00:13:21,265 --> 00:13:23,834
YOU KNOW THAT PRETTY
WOMAN WITH THE POTTERY?

233
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:25,102
OH, YEAH.

234
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:26,704
AND THEN THERE'S THAT BIT ABOUT
THE PENNY AND THE DOOR?

235
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:27,972
YEP.

236
00:13:28,038 --> 00:13:29,974
THOSE ARE BOTH SCENES OUT
OF THE MOVIE "GHOST."

237
00:13:34,445 --> 00:13:39,083
I WAS A TECHNICAL ADVISOR ON
THAT MOVIE

238
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:43,554
BECAUSE THEY WANTED IT --
BECAUSE THEY WANTED IT TO
BE ACCURATE.

239
00:13:43,621 --> 00:13:45,156
SO IN ANSWER TO THIS LETTER, I
WOULD SAY,

240
00:13:45,222 --> 00:13:48,726
YES, THERE IS AN AFTERLIFE
WAITING FOR US AND IT'S FULL!

241
00:13:48,792 --> 00:13:56,000
YEAH, UNFORTUNATELY, THE
AFTERLIFE IS FULL OF THE
SAME STUFF THIS ONE IS.

242
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:58,536
A LITTLE CAMPING TRIP ON THIS
WEEK'S ADVENTURE WITH BILL.

243
00:13:58,602 --> 00:13:59,670
HOW YOU DOING THERE, BILL?

244
00:13:59,737 --> 00:14:01,605
OH, YOU'RE FINE.

245
00:14:01,672 --> 00:14:04,241
YEAH, WE LIKE TO GET OUT IN THE
OUTDOORS, GET A LITTLE
EXERCISE.

246
00:14:04,308 --> 00:14:07,645
IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.

247
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:10,381
I ENJOY THE BACKPACKING MYSELF.

248
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,953
ANYWAY, BILL KIND OF PICKED
OUT A SPOT THERE.

249
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,523
AND KIND OF THOUGHT I'D THIN
OUT THE FOREST A LITTLE BIT.

250
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:23,661
DIDN'T REALIZE, UNFORTUNATELY,
THAT I PUT THAT TREE RIGHT
BETWEEN BILL'S LEGS.

251
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:27,164
DOESN'T HAPPEN ALL THAT OFTEN
UP AT THE LODGE.

252
00:14:27,231 --> 00:14:30,501
OKAY, BACK UP.
I'LL BACK HER UP.

253
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:37,608
AHHHH!

254
00:14:37,675 --> 00:14:38,942
OH!
OH, HE'S FINE.

255
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:41,011
YOU KNOW, CAMPING IS A VERY
PERSONAL THING.

256
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:45,115
AND YOU CAN KNOW A LOT ABOUT
A PERSON BY WHAT THEY CARRY
IN THE BACKPACK.

257
00:14:45,182 --> 00:14:53,223
I KIND OF GO LIGHT AND BILL --
WELL, HE GOES CABLE.

258
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,092
ANYWAY, WE GOT ALL OF OUR
STUFF OUT THERE.

259
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,927
AND IT'S TIME TO ROLL
OUT THE BEDROLLS.

260
00:14:56,994 --> 00:14:59,563
BILL, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HANG
ON TO THE ONE END.

261
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,931
THERE YOU GO.
THERE YOU GO.

262
00:15:00,998 --> 00:15:02,332
GO GET IT.
GO GET IT!

263
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,271
THERE YOU GO.

264
00:15:07,337 --> 00:15:08,639
A LITTLE MORE SPEED
GOING THERE, BILL.

265
00:15:08,705 --> 00:15:11,275
LOOK OUT!
THERE WE GO.

266
00:15:11,341 --> 00:15:12,843
HE'S PROBABLY TIRED NOW.

267
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,447
WHAT THE HECK'S THIS?

268
00:15:19,183 --> 00:15:21,051
THERE YOU GO.
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

269
00:15:21,118 --> 00:15:24,955
OH!
HMM.

270
00:15:25,022 --> 00:15:28,425
LATER THAT DAY, BILL GOT INTO
BED, EVERYTHING FINE.

271
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:33,130
OH, OH, OH.

272
00:15:33,197 --> 00:15:35,098
ANYWAY, WE GOT OURSELVES
ALL SETTLED IN.

273
00:15:35,165 --> 00:15:39,336
LOT OF MOSQUITOES, SO BILL KIND
OF ZIPPED HIMSELF UP THERE
LIKE A SAUSAGE ROLL,

274
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:42,105
AND HE -- YOU KNOW, HE
HAD GOTTEN IN THERE A
LITTLE TOO QUICK.

275
00:15:42,172 --> 00:15:46,143
AND HE FORGOTTEN TO PUT DOWN
ONE OF THE KEY COMPONENTS
IN ANY CAMPING TRIP,

276
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,445
A GROUNDSHEET, RIGHT, BILL?

277
00:15:48,512 --> 00:15:50,480
A LITTLE SOGGY IS IT, BILL?

278
00:15:50,547 --> 00:15:53,217
AND NOT FROM THE INSIDE
THIS TIME.

279
00:15:53,283 --> 00:15:55,986
NOPE.

280
00:15:56,053 --> 00:15:57,354
THIS IS STARTING TO --

281
00:15:57,421 --> 00:16:00,290
BILL, YOU DIDN'T PUT
DOWN YOUR GROUNDSHEET.

282
00:16:00,357 --> 00:16:02,092
COME ON, PUT THAT DOWN.

283
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:04,428
YOU'LL BE FINE.

284
00:16:04,494 --> 00:16:07,297
SO HE DOESN'T WANT TO GET OUT
OF THE SLEEPING BAG THERE
BECAUSE OF THE MOSQUITOES

285
00:16:07,364 --> 00:16:09,633
AND DECIDES HE CAN
JUST DO IT--

286
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,869
LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THOSE
CATERPILLARS IN THE COCOONS.

287
00:16:12,936 --> 00:16:16,473
I DON'T WANT TO SEE THE
BUTTERFLY THAT COMES OUT
OF THAT ONE, I TELL YOU.

288
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,408
YEAH, THERE YOU GO, BILL.

289
00:16:18,475 --> 00:16:23,547
AND, BILL, IF YOU NEED ANY
HELP, I'M HERE FOR YOU, BUDDY.

290
00:16:23,614 --> 00:16:27,818
THERE YOU GO.
ALL RIGHT.

291
00:16:27,884 --> 00:16:29,353
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

292
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:31,955
YEAH, WELL, IN MY WAY.
YOU KNOW.

293
00:16:32,022 --> 00:16:33,657
THERE HE'S ALL SET.
JUMP INTO BED, BILL.

294
00:16:33,724 --> 00:16:36,893
AWAY YOU GO.
GOOD NIGHT!

295
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:45,635
OH, YOU'RE FINE.
OKAY. OKAY.

296
00:16:45,702 --> 00:16:49,606
SO THEY HAD THEIR TEST RUNNING
OF THE BULLS, RIGHT?

297
00:16:49,673 --> 00:16:53,777
NOW, YOU'VE GOT THIS GUY
NAMED MOOSE, AND FOR
GOOD REASON, OKAY?

298
00:16:53,844 --> 00:16:56,680
AND HE'S CHASING ALL THE
MEN RIGHT DOWN THE CENTRE
OF TOWN, RIGHT?

299
00:16:56,747 --> 00:17:00,484
OKAY, THAT'S ALL YOU REALLY NEED
TO KNOW.

300
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,386
UNCLE RED, COME IN HERE.
COME ON IN HERE, UNCLE RED.

301
00:17:06,556 --> 00:17:09,826
TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENED.

302
00:17:09,893 --> 00:17:13,029
MOOSE DOES NOT
CORNER WELL.

303
00:17:13,096 --> 00:17:16,299
THAT'S TRUE BECAUSE THEY WERE
CHUGGING ALONG PRETTY WELL
ON THE STRAIGHTAWAY.

304
00:17:16,366 --> 00:17:18,835
AND THEN WE HIT THE SHARP CURVE
IN THE MIDDLE OF TOWN THERE.

305
00:17:18,902 --> 00:17:23,273
RIGHT IN FRONT OF
THE YOGURT STAND.

306
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:28,178
ALL THE WAY HOME I WAS AFRAID
SOME HEALTH NUT WAS GOING TO
START LICKING ME.

307
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:31,114
WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS,
YOU KNOW, THAT THIS CRAZY
EVENT OF YOURS

308
00:17:31,181 --> 00:17:33,016
IS MERCIFULLY A LOST CAUSE.

309
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,252
OH, NO. NO, IT'S NOT
OVER UNTIL I QUIT.

310
00:17:35,318 --> 00:17:36,987
AND I'M NOT QUITTING.

311
00:17:37,053 --> 00:17:39,089
WE'RE GOING TO DO THE WHOLE
RUNNING THING AGAIN,

312
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:40,457
ONLY THIS TIME WE'RE
GOING TO USE A LION.

313
00:17:40,524 --> 00:17:42,292
A LION?
A LION!

314
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:45,295
A LION, LIKE A 10-FOOT
RAZOR-FANG MAN-EATING LION?

315
00:17:45,362 --> 00:17:47,030
WELL, SORT OF.

316
00:17:47,097 --> 00:17:50,367
WE'LL USE THE LION FROM
FLINTY MCCLINTOCK'S AFRICAN
LION SAFARI.

317
00:17:50,433 --> 00:17:52,269
FLINTY'S LION?
YES.

318
00:17:52,335 --> 00:17:58,241
THAT'S A MANGY OLD ARTHRITIC,
DYSPEPTIC, SENILE, TOOTHLESS,
HALF-BLIND LION.

319
00:17:58,308 --> 00:18:02,512
THAT THING IS -- ACTUALLY, I
HEARD IT WAS A DEFORMED PIG.

320
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:04,247
THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.

321
00:18:04,314 --> 00:18:07,350
YOU'LL HAVE TO PUT IT ON A
SKATEBOARD AND WHEEL IT
THROUGH DOWNTOWN.

322
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:09,286
FLINTY'S NOT GOING TO
LEND IT TO YOU ANYWAY.

323
00:18:09,352 --> 00:18:11,021
HE GIVES YOU THAT LION,

324
00:18:11,087 --> 00:18:15,158
HIS WHOLE LION SAFARI WILL BE A
WHOLE BUNCH OF SNOW FENCES
HOLDING BACK CHICKENS.

325
00:18:15,225 --> 00:18:17,193
HOW ABOUT THAT MINK RANCH
OUTSIDE OF TOWN?

326
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,429
OH, YEAH, THAT PLACE WITH THE
LITTLE WEE CORRALS.

327
00:18:19,496 --> 00:18:22,265
HEY, WE'LL HAVE THE
RUNNING OF THE MINKS.

328
00:18:22,332 --> 00:18:23,700
DOES THAT SAY CLASS TO YOU?

329
00:18:23,767 --> 00:18:27,470
OH, YEAH!
THIRD!

330
00:18:28,905 --> 00:18:30,373
THIS IS THE REPAIR SHOP
PART OF THE SHOW

331
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,711
THAT WE CALL "IF IT AIN'T BROKE,
YOU'RE NOT TRYING."

332
00:18:34,778 --> 00:18:36,746
DALTON HUMPHREYS BROUGHT
SOMETHING IN FOR US TO FIX.

333
00:18:36,813 --> 00:18:38,515
WHAT DID YOU BRING
US THERE, DALTON?

334
00:18:38,581 --> 00:18:45,021
WELL, YOU KNOW, RED, I WAS
HOPING THAT YOU COULD FIX MY
TENNIS RACKET HERE.

335
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:47,323
JUST GOT THAT LAST WEEK.

336
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,626
JOHN MCENROE HAVE A
GARAGE SALE, DID HE?

337
00:18:49,692 --> 00:18:51,861
NO, NO, THAT'S BRAND NEW, RED.

338
00:18:51,928 --> 00:18:53,530
CAN YOU FIX IT?

339
00:18:53,596 --> 00:18:55,465
BOY, I DON'T KNOW, DALTON.

340
00:18:55,532 --> 00:19:04,240
YOU SEE, THIS IS A TITANIUM
GRAPHITE, AND THOSE STRINGS ARE
MADE FROM SNOW LEOPARD GUT.

341
00:19:04,307 --> 00:19:06,643
YOU KNOW, IT ALMOST LOOKS
LIKE IT WAS BENT AROUND THE
POST OR SOMETHING.

342
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:09,212
NO, MY WIFE DID THAT.

343
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:10,747
DID IT RIGHT AROUND HER KNEE.

344
00:19:10,814 --> 00:19:12,715
WOW.

345
00:19:12,782 --> 00:19:15,151
ANN-MARIE IS A SMALLISH
WOMAN, BUT, BOY, WHEN THOSE
HORMONES KICK IN,

346
00:19:15,218 --> 00:19:19,856
SHE'S JUST GOT A POWER TO HER.

347
00:19:19,923 --> 00:19:22,025
SO DID SHE BREAK THE
STRINGS TOO?

348
00:19:22,091 --> 00:19:23,993
NO, NO, WE DID
THAT TOGETHER.

349
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,597
YEAH.
MAY I?

350
00:19:27,664 --> 00:19:29,532
YEAH, SURE.

351
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:34,003
IT WAS THIS KIND OF
LOOK, YOU SEE?

352
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:38,341
SHE JUST HAD AN IMPRESSIVE
OVERHEAD SMASH.

353
00:19:38,408 --> 00:19:40,276
SHE JUST REALLY GOT ALL OF IT.

354
00:19:40,343 --> 00:19:41,644
YEAH.

355
00:19:41,711 --> 00:19:46,215
ARE YOU HAVING PROBLEMS
AT HOME OF ANY KIND?

356
00:19:46,282 --> 00:19:48,551
OH, NO.
NO, NO, NO.

357
00:19:48,618 --> 00:19:51,220
OH, NOTHING SERIOUS, RED.

358
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:55,191
YOU KNOW, WE RECENTLY HAD OUR
20TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY.

359
00:19:55,258 --> 00:19:56,459
ALL RIGHT.

360
00:19:56,526 --> 00:20:00,463
YEAH, YEAH.
WHICH I FORGOT.

361
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:04,133
TRIED TO PASS OFF THIS TENNIS
RACKET AS AN ANNIVERSARY GIFT

362
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,039
AND -- APPARENTLY ANN-MARIE
ISN'T A BIG TENNIS FAN.

363
00:20:10,106 --> 00:20:11,975
WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD, DALTON.

364
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,143
BUT CONGRATULATIONS ON
THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY.

365
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,512
THAT'S SILVER, ISN'T IT?

366
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:20,450
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
IT IS, BUT I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT IT'S NOT.

367
00:20:20,516 --> 00:20:23,920
IT'S NOT TITANIUM GRAPHITE.
THAT'S FOR SURE.

368
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:37,066
WELL, THE RUNNING OF THE MINK
WAS NOT AN UNQUALIFIED SUCCESS.

369
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:41,204
DOZENS OF CASUALTIES!

370
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,073
IT WAS LIKE GUYS WERE TRAMPLED
AND STOMPED AND BITTEN.

371
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,611
ONE WOMAN PULLED A MUSCLE
LAUGHING SO HARD.

372
00:20:48,678 --> 00:20:50,413
YEAH, HAROLD, WHAT I
COULDN'T FIGURE OUT

373
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,884
WAS HOW COME THE MINKS ALL
WENT UP INSIDE OF JUNIOR'S
PANTS LIKE THAT?

374
00:20:54,951 --> 00:20:57,687
IT'S BECAUSE HE KEEPS FOOD IN
HIS POCKETS ALL THE TIME.

375
00:20:57,753 --> 00:20:59,922
THOSE MINKS JUST WIZZED
RIGHT UP THERE.

376
00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:04,060
SO DID JUNIOR.

377
00:21:06,596 --> 00:21:08,865
BOY, OH, BOY, HE WENT
CRAZY, DIDN'T HE?

378
00:21:08,931 --> 00:21:12,435
IT BECAME THE RUNNING
OF THE JUNIOR.

379
00:21:12,502 --> 00:21:13,769
HE WAS KNOCKING THINGS OVER.

380
00:21:13,836 --> 00:21:15,838
HE WAS SMASHING INTO PEOPLE
AND TRAMPLING OVER THEM.

381
00:21:15,905 --> 00:21:19,208
BOY, OH, BOY, I HAD NO IDEA
JUNIOR COULD MOVE SO FAST.

382
00:21:19,275 --> 00:21:21,143
WELL, HAROLD, YOU KNOW, YOU GET
A DOZEN MINK IN YOUR SHORTS,

383
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:24,046
AND YOU GET THE
ADRENALINE MOVING.

384
00:21:24,113 --> 00:21:27,650
BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK PEOPLE
GOT THEIR MONEY'S WORTH ON THAT.

385
00:21:27,717 --> 00:21:30,887
YEAH, TICKETS WERE FREE,
SO I THINK SO TOO.

386
00:21:30,953 --> 00:21:34,757
MINK!
MINK!
MINK!

387
00:21:34,824 --> 00:21:37,260
IT'S THE MEETING.
JUST THE MEETING.

388
00:21:37,326 --> 00:21:40,930
YEAH, WELL, I WAS JUST DOING
THAT IN CASE --

389
00:21:40,997 --> 00:21:42,698
FOR YOUR OWN SAKE,
I'M GOING DOWNSTAIRS.

390
00:21:42,765 --> 00:21:44,000
ALL RIGHT.

391
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:45,701
I WANT TO GET THE MINK LAUGHING.

392
00:21:45,768 --> 00:21:47,903
OKAY.

393
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,905
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT
HOME AFTER THE MEETING.

394
00:21:49,972 --> 00:21:53,242
AND YOU KNOW YOU ALWAYS SAY YOU
WANT TO HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF
THE FEEL OF REAL MINK?

395
00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:56,879
YOU MAY WANT TO CHECK WITH
JUNIOR ON THAT.

396
00:21:56,946 --> 00:21:58,881
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

397
00:21:58,948 --> 00:22:02,618
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND HAROLD
AND THE WHOLE GANG UP HERE
AT POSSUM LODGE,

398
00:22:02,685 --> 00:22:04,887
YOU KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

401
00:22:14,563 --> 00:22:18,567
YOU'VE GOT TO SIT DOWN BECAUSE
HE GETS REALLY GRUMPY IF
YOU'RE STANDING.

402
00:22:18,634 --> 00:22:20,236
GET THEM UP, HAROLD.

403
00:22:20,302 --> 00:22:25,608
OKAY.
ALL RISE.
