AREN'T CATCHIN' ANYTHING.

00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:32,310
I CAN STILL HAVE
A MID-ENGINE CAR.

159
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,280
OKAY, FROM THE BACK
OF THE CAR TO THE ENGINE

160
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,451
IS EXACTLY...
AROUND 12'11".

161
00:08:39,451 --> 00:08:41,353
BUT FROM THE ENGINE
TO THE FRONT OF THE CAR

162
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:42,954
IS ONLY 4'9".

163
00:08:42,954 --> 00:08:44,456
SO IF I WANNA HAVE
THE ENGINE IN THE MIDDLE,

164
00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:47,792
I CAN EITHER MOVE THE ENGINE
BACK AROUND 5 FEET,

165
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:50,362
WHICH WOULD WREAK HAVOC
WITH MY CUP HOLDERS,

166
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:52,530
OR I COULD LOP 12 FEET
OFF THE BACK END,

167
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,133
BUT THAT WOULD FORCE ME TO
SIT ON THE HOOD ORNAMENT.

168
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:57,235
SO SIMPLEST OF ALL,
ALL'S I GOTTA DO

169
00:08:57,235 --> 00:08:59,738
IS ADD 8 FEET
TO THE FRONT END.

170
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:01,840
NOW, IF YOU'RE DOIN'
THIS IN METRIC,

171
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,009
BEST OF LUCK TO YOU.

172
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,927
BOY, THAT WAS
A LOT OF SAWING.

173
00:09:22,927 --> 00:09:24,529
BUT I'VE GOT THE NEW CHUNK

174
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:25,897
TO STICK ONTO THE
FRONT OF MY VEHICLE.

175
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:27,932
THE WHEELS EVEN
TURN ON THIS THING.

176
00:09:27,932 --> 00:09:29,367
SAFE OR WHAT?

177
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:31,336
NOW, I REMOVED THE ENGINE AND
DRIVE TRAIN FROM THE UNIT.

178
00:09:31,336 --> 00:09:33,805
WELL, ACTUALLY, RUST
AND GRAVITY REMOVED THEM.

179
00:09:33,805 --> 00:09:35,407
BUT I DIDN'T FIGHT IT.

180
00:09:35,407 --> 00:09:39,144
I GOTTA FIND SOME WAY
TO FLATTEN THIS ROOF DOWN.

181
00:09:39,144 --> 00:09:41,579
OTHERWISE, IT'S GONNA
LOOK KINDA SILLY.

182
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:44,082
I'M OUTTA
HACKSAW BLADES, SO...

183
00:10:01,766 --> 00:10:03,334
YOU WANNA USE A FAIR WHACK

184
00:10:03,334 --> 00:10:05,336
OF THE HANDYMAN'S
SECRET WEAPON ON THIS JOB.

185
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:08,573
I WOULD RECOMMEND
FIVE LARGE ROLLS.

186
00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:10,441
IF THAT'S TOO RICH FOR YOU,

187
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:12,443
HEY, MAYBE YOU CAN'T
AFFORD TO HAVE

188
00:10:12,443 --> 00:10:14,646
A EUROPEAN-STYLE
MID-ENGINE CAR.

189
00:10:14,646 --> 00:10:16,447
AND FOR THAT
FINISHING TOUCH,

190
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,349
TO MAKE THIS BABY
LOOK EXTRA SHARP,

191
00:10:18,349 --> 00:10:20,451
PUT A PIZZA BOX
OVER THE WHEEL WELLS

192
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:22,954
TO HIDE WHERE
THE TIRES USED TO BE.

193
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:24,889
I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU
PUT A REAL GOOD PRIMER

194
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:26,257
ON THOSE PIZZA BOXES,

195
00:10:26,257 --> 00:10:27,959
BECAUSE WHEN
CARDBOARD GETS WET,

196
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,962
IT LOSES A LOT
OF ITS STRENGTH.

197
00:10:30,962 --> 00:10:33,598
OKAY... SO REMEMBER,

198
00:10:33,598 --> 00:10:35,867
IF THE WOMEN DON'T
FIND YOU HANDSOME,

199
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:38,002
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

200
00:10:38,002 --> 00:10:40,338
THIS ISN'T AN
OLD JUNKER ANYMORE.

201
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:43,708
IT'S A FANCY ITALIAN
MID-ENGINE JUNKER.

202
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:48,680
AND I'M NOT RED GREEN.
I'M UMBERTO TORTELLINI.

203
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,865
[ CRASH ]

204
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:18,676
[ APPLAUSE ]

205
00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:30,088
I HAVE A SHOCKING REVELATION
FOR YOU MEN OUT THERE.

206
00:11:30,088 --> 00:11:33,691
THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO ARE SMARTER THAN YOU.

207
00:11:33,691 --> 00:11:35,693
FOR YOU MARRIED GUYS,

208
00:11:35,693 --> 00:11:38,896
THIS IS PROBABLY NOT THE FIRST
TIME YOU'RE HEARING THIS.

209
00:11:38,896 --> 00:11:42,033
SEE, I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THERE
ARE SMARTER PEOPLE THAN ME.

210
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:43,668
BUT THE THING THAT GETS ME

211
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:45,536
IS HOW THE AGE OF
THE SMARTER PEOPLE

212
00:11:45,536 --> 00:11:47,538
HAS CHANGED OVER
THE COURSE OF MY LIFE.

213
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:50,174
WHEN I WAS A KID,
MY MIND WAS QUICK AND SHARP.

214
00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:52,977
I'D HAVE TO GO TO UP FIVE,
MAYBE EVEN TEN YEARS OLDER

215
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:55,746
TO FIND PEOPLE
SMARTER THAN ME.

216
00:11:55,746 --> 00:11:57,849
BY THE TIME I HIT 40,

217
00:11:57,849 --> 00:12:01,485
THE PEOPLE SMARTER THAN ME
WERE ALL AROUND MY OWN AGE.

218
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:04,255
THAT'S WHEN THE
TROUBLE STARTED.

219
00:12:04,255 --> 00:12:06,090
MY AGE KEPT GOING UP,

220
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,226
BUT THE AGE OF PEOPLE
SMARTER THAN ME

221
00:12:08,226 --> 00:12:10,595
STARTED GOIN' DOWN.

222
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:13,130
IT BEGAN WITH
A 25-YEAR-OLD WOMAN

223
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,266
EXPLAINING THAT
THE BANK MACHINE

224
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:17,435
WON'T ALLOW ME
TO WITHDRAW CASH

225
00:12:17,435 --> 00:12:19,570
FROM AN OVERDRAWN ACCOUNT.

226
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,205
THEN A COUPLE
OF YEARS LATER,

227
00:12:21,205 --> 00:12:23,174
IT WAS A 16-YEAR-OLD
SKATE BOARDER POINTING OUT

228
00:12:23,174 --> 00:12:25,376
THAT THE CHEAP GAS
I JUST PUT IN MY TANK

229
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:27,945
WAS DIESEL.

230
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:31,048
THEN LAST WEEK,
A 9-YEAR-OLD COMPUTER WHIZ

231
00:12:31,048 --> 00:12:34,018
WAS TELLIN' ME THE REASON
MY MONITOR DOESN'T WORK

232
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:37,788
IS BECAUSE IT'S
A MICROWAVE OVEN.

233
00:12:37,788 --> 00:12:41,626
BUT MY STUPIDITY CAN
BE OUR LITTLE SECRET.

234
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:43,561
THAT'S BECAUSE
IN MOST GROUPS

235
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:45,997
I LOOK LIKE THE SMART ONE.

236
00:12:45,997 --> 00:12:49,166
ALL THESE WRINKLES AND SCARS
FROM DOIN' STUPID THINGS

237
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:52,636
HAVE GIVEN ME THE
APPEARANCE OF GREAT WISDOM.

238
00:12:52,636 --> 00:12:55,373
THEY ASSUME I MUST
KNOW A LOT OF STUFF.

239
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:57,842
SO ALL I HAVE TO DO TO COME
ACROSS AS A GENIUS

240
00:12:57,842 --> 00:13:00,678
IS TO JUST KEEP
MY MOUTH SHUT.

241
00:13:01,712 --> 00:13:04,281
IF ONLY I WAS THAT SMART.

242
00:13:04,281 --> 00:13:05,983
REMEMBER, I'M PULLIN'
FOR YOU.

243
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:07,818
WE'RE ALL IN
THIS TOGETHER.

244
00:13:07,818 --> 00:13:10,821
[ APPLAUSE ]

245
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,992
WELL, THIS IS
GETTIN' SERIOUS.

246
00:13:14,992 --> 00:13:17,061
WE'VE GIVEN UP ON
DIGGING THE WELL DEEPER.

247
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:19,864
AND THIS IS THE LAST
OF OUR DRINKING WATER.

248
00:13:19,864 --> 00:13:22,833
I CAN'T BRING MYSELF
TO BUY THE BOTTLED STUFF,

249
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,136
BECAUSE AFTER I DIE,
I'LL RUN INTO MY GRANDFATHER,

250
00:13:25,136 --> 00:13:27,104
AND HE'S GONNA
GIVE ME A LOT OF GRIEF

251
00:13:27,104 --> 00:13:30,508
ABOUT PAYIN' 12 BUCKS A
GALLON FOR DRINKING WATER.

252
00:13:30,508 --> 00:13:32,510
MIND YOU, IF IT'S HEAVEN,
THERE'S A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE

253
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:36,113
THAT AT LEAST ONE
OF US WON'T BE THERE.

254
00:13:36,113 --> 00:13:39,183
NOW, HAROLD WANTS US TO
HOOK UP TO THE TOWN WATER,

255
00:13:39,183 --> 00:13:40,784
BUT WE DON'T
WANNA DO THAT.

256
00:13:40,784 --> 00:13:42,386
WE'RE GONNA DRILL
A BRAND NEW WELL.

257
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:44,922
IN FACT, WE'VE GOT ONE OF
THOSE WATER FINDING EXPERTS

258
00:13:44,922 --> 00:13:46,991
COMING OVER RIGHT NOW.

259
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:48,292
HEY, RED.
YEAH?

260
00:13:48,292 --> 00:13:49,860
ALL SET TO GO.
GREAT!

261
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,897
WHERE'S THE WATER-
FINDING EXPERT GUY?

262
00:13:52,897 --> 00:13:55,132
IT'S MIKE.

263
00:13:57,101 --> 00:14:01,205
MIKE FELL DOWN THE WELL
AND COULDN'T FIND WATER.

264
00:14:01,205 --> 00:14:04,008
I DON'T THINK YOU
SHOULD USE AN ACCIDENT

265
00:14:04,008 --> 00:14:08,245
AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO
POOH-POOH ME, MR. GREEN.

266
00:14:08,245 --> 00:14:11,282
THE TRUTH IS
WHEN I WAS IN PRISON,

267
00:14:11,282 --> 00:14:14,485
I BECAME VERY PROFICIENT AT
USING A DIVINING ROD

268
00:14:14,485 --> 00:14:17,855
TO LOCATE
UNDERGROUND TUNNELS.

269
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,157
GIVE HIM
A CHANCE, RED.

270
00:14:20,157 --> 00:14:21,926
FEELS LIKE A WASTE
OF TIME TO ME.

271
00:14:21,926 --> 00:14:26,130
WELL, YOU OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD
BE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT.

272
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,732
OKAY, HERE GOES.

273
00:14:28,732 --> 00:14:30,734
OH, MAN.

274
00:14:30,734 --> 00:14:32,770
THERE!
WOW! LOOK!

275
00:14:36,974 --> 00:14:39,576
GOLLY, THAT'S
CONVINCING.

276
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,016
YOU HAVE WATER
ON THE KNEE.

277
00:14:46,016 --> 00:14:48,886
IT'S A MEDICAL
CONDITION.

THERE'S YOUR WATER,

IT'S RIGHT DOWN
UNDER THAT POST.

282
00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:03,000
THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.

NO, THE STICK
NEVER LIES.

284
00:15:04,635 --> 00:15:06,403
LOOK DOWN THERE.
IT'S MAYBE 9 OR
10 FEET DOWN,

BUT IT'S THERE
ALL RIGHT.

OUTLET ON THAT POST.

SHORT THAT OUT?

NOT A PROBLEM.

HAS TO START FORM SCRATCH.

KNOW HOW TO REACT.

A LITTLE MORE
TIME TEACHING HAROLD,

SO HE JUST HAPPENS TO HAVE A
SURGICAL GLOVE IN HIS
PANTS THERE.

313
00:16:31,488 --> 00:16:33,757
AND HE GETS THAT OUT
AND GONNA FILL THAT WITH MILK

IF HE USES THE GLOVE,

A FEEL FOR IT.

THROW THE SWITCH

THIS SOMETHING EVEN
HAROLD COULD UNDERSTAND.

332

HAROLD HAS AN
ATTENTION DEFICIT PROBLEM,

AND OF COURSE,
WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT,

00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:19,936
THERE WAS A
FLY IN THE BARN.

SO IT'S COMING AROUND.
HAROLD CAN'T IGNORE THAT.

SO HE'S FLIPPING --
JUST FORGET THE --

IT DOESN'T MATTER.

IT DOESN'T MATTER, HAROLD.

RIGHT DOWN THE CHUTE.

IS TURNING ON THE UNIT.

HAVE A LOT OF ACTION.

YOU CAN LOSE
YOUR BRAINS, HAROLD.

WALTER TRIES TO
PULL IT OFF.

345

UH, WHEN SOMEONE'S IN TROUBLE,
YOU SHOULD JUST STAY AWAY

BECAUSE YOU CAN ACTUALLY
GET HURT YOURSELF...

THERE LIKE THAT.

348
00:17:57,574 --> 00:17:58,975
SO THEN HE REALISES,

349
00:17:58,975 --> 00:18:01,344
WHY DON'T I JUST TURN
THE MACHINE OFF?

350

THERE THAT SHUT
OFF THE VACUUM,

00:18:03,113 --> 00:18:05,782
AND NOW YOU CAN TAKE
THE UNIT RIGHT OFF HIM.
