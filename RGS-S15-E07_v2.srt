1
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:04,504
All the great chefs in
the world are men

2
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:07,941
There's the guy
with the hat

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:10,844
and the "Bam" guy

4
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:14,280
and the funny guy.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,016
So I would think that most
men would like to cook.

6
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:19,119
I mean, you get
to use lots of tools

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,155
and you can eat your mistakes
or at least your dog can

8
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:25,024
and you don't have to buy
any of those fancy
kitchen gadgets,

9
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:28,161
you can use the equipment
you already have.

10
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,430
Like why would
you need a mixer

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,867
if you already
have a drill?

12
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,971
You reload your nail gun
with toothpicks...

13
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:41,307
you're ready to make
hors d'oeuvres.

14
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,411
Where are you going,
you weiner?

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,282
And here's a dandy,

16
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:53,820
you know they advertise
these home vacuum-packing
systems for food on T.V.

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,356
and the salesman says if you
don't get one of these
for your wife,

18
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,858
you're almost like a --
like a war criminal.

19
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:03,663
But hey, I already have
a vacuum cleaner.

20
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:05,465
All I got to do

21
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,834
is suck the air out
of the bag.

22
00:01:29,555 --> 00:01:35,495

00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:38,097

24
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:38,931
All right.

I appreciate that.

Thank you very much.

30
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:48,508
You know what this is?

31
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:51,711
These are called
Yorkshire Puddings.

32
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,813
I made these.

33
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:56,683
Don't worry, I haven't
crossed over or anything.

34
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,152
Just a little business
deal I'm working on.

35
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,387
Bernice and I were out at
a seafood restaurant
the other night

36
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,589
and wouldn't you know it,
they're out of steak.

37
00:02:03,589 --> 00:02:05,858
So I got to take a walk
on the wild side

38
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:07,360
and order roast beef

39
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,229
and it comes with
one of these Yorkshire
Pudding deals on the side.

40
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,733
I thought a wasp nest had
dropped off of one of
the ceiling tiles.

41
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:16,502
You know, it's kind
of doughy on the outside,

42
00:02:16,502 --> 00:02:18,070
nothing on the inside

43
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,473
sort of like
a lodge member.

44
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,875
So that's when my
entrepreneurial mind kicks in.

45
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,445
You know, in our town,
we got four doughnut shops,

46
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,980
three muffin outlets
and a bagel factory,

47
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,349
but so far nobody's had
the smarts to open up

48
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:32,652
a Yorkshire Pudding
drive thru.

to see me?

51
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:39,258
Yeah, I need your
brain for something.

52
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:41,194
Ahh... thank you
very much.

53
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:45,064
I figure you're
not using it so...

54

Harold, do you know
what that is?

55
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,935
Oh yeah, yeah.

56
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,237
I've been
to a horse farm.

57
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:55,708
Harold, I made
these myself.

58
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:06,319
You must eat
a lot of oats.

59
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,659
It's a Yorkshire Pudding,
Harold, okay?

60
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:15,361
This is the next
big thing for me.

61
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,997
I've already got a retired
athlete as a spokesperson.

00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,475
Wow.

65
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,644
Wow, who's he?

66
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,446
He's a hockey --

67
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:35,915
He's a great
hockey player, Harold.

68
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,017
He's the best left-handed,
one-legged defenseman

69
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:40,986
that ever played for the
Port Asbestos Aspirators,

70
00:03:40,986 --> 00:03:42,855
that's who he is.

71
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,690
Okay, I just thought
that a celebrity

72
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,624
was supposed
to be famous.

73
00:03:45,624 --> 00:03:48,060
I never heard
of "Gump" Gorbachek.

74
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,962
Well, you probably
know him as Bob.

75
00:03:49,962 --> 00:03:51,864
They call him Bob but
his real name's "Gump."

76
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,532
Bob?

77
00:03:53,532 --> 00:03:55,735
I know that guy.
I know him.

78
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,870
Oh yeah, he's a big
hairy guy, no front teeth.

79
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,706
Yeah, they call
him "puckface."

80
00:04:00,706 --> 00:04:02,842
Well, close enough

81
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,877
and the missing
front teeth

82
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:06,345
is one of the things
I like about him

83
00:04:06,345 --> 00:04:07,813
because his smile
makes it look like

84
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:10,149
our Yorkshire Puddings
are easy to chew.

Uncle Red, you know
nothing about creating
a restaurant franchise.

I have a plan.

00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:19,058
Oh really, and
what might that be?

88

My plan is to think
of something brilliant.

If you ever meet
your real dad,

125
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:02,127
you'll probably want
to give him one of these...

Oh, a paternity test.

Well you know,
just to be sure.

I mean the last
time I saw him

129
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:10,102
I was still
in Huggies.

130
00:06:10,102 --> 00:06:11,970
Yes!

131
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,545
You know, if you want
to invite friends

132
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,380
over to your house
but it's too small

133
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,215
or your friends
are too large,

134
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:24,883
you've got two options.

135
00:06:24,883 --> 00:06:26,552
Move to a bigger place

136
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,820
or put an addition
on your current one.

137
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,257
Now, I don't know a lot
about buying real estate...

138
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:38,497
but I do have an idea for an
addition that's fast, easy,

139
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:41,867
and best of all,
requires no construction.

140
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:44,770
That's right,
we're talking "pre-fab."

141
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,472
Now, "pre-fab" comes
from the Latin phrase,

142
00:06:47,472 --> 00:06:49,408
"prefabricatamus."

143
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,310
"Pre" means "before"

144
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,146
and I believe "fabricatamus"
means "think things through."

145
00:06:54,146 --> 00:06:56,014
So before you
think things through,

146
00:06:56,014 --> 00:06:57,649
get yourself a few
rolls of duct tape

147
00:06:57,649 --> 00:06:59,451
and a little imagination.

148
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:01,853
Oh yeah and a bus.

149
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:03,422
Hope you're not thinking
things through,

150
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,123
remember, "pre-fab."

151
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:15,767
Now, this is probably not

152
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:17,703
the ideal seating
configuration for
your guests

153
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,571
unless it's the playoffs

154
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:22,074
so we're going to just
rearrange the seats.

155
00:07:33,018 --> 00:07:34,519
Heads up!

156
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:38,824
Glad that
wasn't my chain saw.

157
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:43,428
Fore!

158
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:53,271
Okay, after you carefully
remove the bolts

159
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:56,475
you can start
rearranging the seats.

160
00:07:56,475 --> 00:08:00,178
For example, if your guests
want to stay overnight,

161
00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:02,981
you need to give them
somewhere to sleep.

162
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:06,585
Oh sure, they could just
sleep on the seats,

163
00:08:06,585 --> 00:08:09,454
but with a touch
of creativity,

164
00:08:09,454 --> 00:08:11,923
we can give them something
a little more comfortable.

165
00:08:11,923 --> 00:08:14,526
And the built-in bedsides
prevent them from falling out

166
00:08:14,526 --> 00:08:17,863
and prevent you
from seeing something
you're not supposed to.

167
00:08:18,897 --> 00:08:21,233
And of course, this unit
has an ensuite bathroom.

168
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:22,400
But here again

169
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,870
a couple of seats
placed just right

170
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,039
are going to give your
guests a little privacy

171
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:32,177
and prevent you
from seeing something

172
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:34,880
you really
don't want to.

173
00:08:36,915 --> 00:08:40,018
Okay, as you can see,
I've put up some

174
00:08:40,018 --> 00:08:42,921
classical pieces of art here,
instead of all the ads

175
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:46,091
'cause you don't
need people selling you
stuff in your own home.

176
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:49,761
Unless it's on TV,
which I fully support.

177
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:53,231
I also recommend you keep
a couple of these chrome poles

178
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:56,201
just in case an
exotic dancer drops by.

179
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:59,304
Who am I kidding?
Turn them into pole lamps.

180
00:09:00,238 --> 00:09:01,873
Of course, the key
to the whole design

181
00:09:01,873 --> 00:09:04,309
is to have the bus door
line up with the house door.

182
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:06,745
It makes them
separate yet together,

183
00:09:06,745 --> 00:09:09,414
kind of like
Canada and Quebec.

184
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:12,584
I guess that makes
these French doors.

185
00:09:12,584 --> 00:09:14,319
Oh, here's
another bonus...

186
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:16,755
Your dog can
let himself out.

187
00:09:19,724 --> 00:09:22,394
And the dining area
is really spectacular.

188
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:25,296
Well, maybe not spectacular,

189
00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:27,699
rectangular probably
a better word.

190
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:30,902
Here again, we just move
a bus seat here or there

191
00:09:30,902 --> 00:09:32,837
line them up just so,

192
00:09:32,837 --> 00:09:36,007
throw a folding table into
the centre of the configuration

193
00:09:36,007 --> 00:09:38,643
and suddenly, it's not
just a dining table,

194
00:09:38,643 --> 00:09:40,445
it's a booth.

195
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:43,615
And the nice thing about
eating here

196
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:47,585
is you don't have to shout
yourself hoarse calling
everybody to dinner.

197
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:51,256
Next stop, supper.

198
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,029
But you got to admit
this "pre-fab" addition

199
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:00,265
has a lot of
attractive features.

200
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:02,534
So remember, if the women
don't find you handsome,

201
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:05,136
they should at least
find you handy.

202
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:07,005
And here's the best part,

203
00:10:07,005 --> 00:10:09,874
if you have guests arrive
who aren't particularly welcome,

204
00:10:09,874 --> 00:10:11,242
you just hit the gas

205
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:14,279
and turn this addition
into a subtraction.

206
00:10:16,848 --> 00:10:20,685
[ APPLAUSE ]

207
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,293
There's a poker craze
going on TV right now

208
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:30,828
that brings out
mixed emotions for me.

209
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:33,298
On the one hand, knowing
that millions of people

210
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:35,533
are willing to watch
six ugly, fat guys

211
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:38,069
play cards for an hour

212
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:42,273
gives me renewed hope
for the success of our show.

213
00:10:42,273 --> 00:10:44,208
On the other hand,

214
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,844
a lot of these people
who are watching are women

215
00:10:46,844 --> 00:10:49,447
and they're getting to see
something very dangerous,

216
00:10:49,447 --> 00:10:52,750
men bluffing.

217
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,819
Pretty soon they'll
become experts

218
00:10:54,819 --> 00:10:56,421
because that's
what women do.

219
00:10:56,421 --> 00:11:00,692
They'll become experts
on figuring out when
men are bluffing.

220
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:04,595
And not just any man,
I'm talking about you and me.

221
00:11:04,595 --> 00:11:07,432
Once our women can spot
when we're bluffing,

222
00:11:07,432 --> 00:11:10,601
life as we know it
will be over.

223
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:14,172
They'll know stuff like
when we're right we
just quiet down

224
00:11:14,172 --> 00:11:18,376
and let them talk themselves
into our little trap

225
00:11:18,376 --> 00:11:20,445
but when we have nothing,

226
00:11:20,445 --> 00:11:23,247
that's when we come out
with guns blazing.

227
00:11:23,247 --> 00:11:26,217
And you can forget the tricks
you see on those poker shows.

228
00:11:26,217 --> 00:11:28,553
Pulling your cowboy hat
down over your face

229
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:31,222
or wearing glasses with
eyeballs painted on them

230
00:11:31,222 --> 00:11:34,258
isn't going to fool
that certain lady.

231
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:36,160
She'll read you
like a book

232
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,497
and book you
like a repeat offender.

233
00:11:39,497 --> 00:11:43,167
Women have no sympathy
for a bluffer, so don't bluff.

234
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:44,836
I suggest you fold 'em

235
00:11:44,836 --> 00:11:47,238
or you'll never
get to hold 'em.

236
00:11:47,238 --> 00:11:48,973
Remember,
I'm pulling for you.

237
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:51,242
We're all in this together.

Hey, don't eat any more
of those Yorkshire
Puddings, Harold!

00:12:23,007 --> 00:12:24,976
Deal.

247
00:12:24,976 --> 00:12:26,510
They're not ready yet.

248
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,912
I've got to put the
chocolate glaze on them.

249
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:29,347
Oh, okay.

250
00:12:31,582 --> 00:12:33,851
So how did the
press conference go?

251
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:35,219
Not real well.

252
00:12:35,219 --> 00:12:37,722
That Gump sure
swears a lot.

253
00:12:37,722 --> 00:12:39,190
Mind you, you know,
with the teeth missing

254
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,359
it's hard to tell.

255

But it gut so bad I had
to use the "F" word
on him.

00:12:47,965 --> 00:12:49,667
Well, that's too bad.

258
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:51,535
Oh boy because Gump's
Yorkshire Puddings

259
00:12:51,535 --> 00:12:53,938
had such a natural ring
to it, too, didn't it?

260
00:12:53,938 --> 00:12:56,073
I can see --
I can just see the logo, too.

261
00:12:56,073 --> 00:12:58,142
It'd be like Gump's
big scar-ridden face

with a Yorkshire Pudding
jammed in the gap
of his smile.

Well, Harold, we got
something even better now.

How about New Yorkshire

you can eat
'em anywhere.

about the hot part.

Mmm? Yeah?

Not bad 'eh?
Not bad.

282
00:13:57,501 --> 00:13:59,503
The boys have decided
to do a little
bird watching

00:13:59,503 --> 00:14:02,273
out in the...
oh, easy, easy, easy.

00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:06,677
Tripods and Bill are
not compatible.

285
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:09,747
So Bill and Winston had
the fancy camera gear

286
00:14:09,747 --> 00:14:12,283
and Ed was a little
more lowbrow.

287
00:14:12,283 --> 00:14:13,951
So they start assembling
their camera.

288
00:14:13,951 --> 00:14:15,419
They're going to go off
and find the --

289
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:16,754
Ed just wanted to stay --

290
00:14:16,754 --> 00:14:18,389
Let's just stay here
and let the birds come to us

291
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:20,024
but no, that
wasn't in the works.

292
00:14:20,024 --> 00:14:21,358
So, yeah, go, go.

293
00:14:21,358 --> 00:14:23,427
So he gets over there
and by now Bill and Winston

294
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:25,696
are starting to
assemble these telescopic

295
00:14:25,696 --> 00:14:27,364
telephoto lens-type things

296
00:14:27,364 --> 00:14:30,901
and Ed is, I say, going
a little lower-end on his

297
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:33,270
and they start making fun
of his but of course,

298
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,173
you know,
he has the flash.

299
00:14:38,108 --> 00:14:40,611
So the two pros head off
into the woods

300
00:14:40,611 --> 00:14:44,348
and mister amateur
falls along behind
with his disposable --

301
00:14:44,348 --> 00:14:46,684
and also with his camera.

302
00:14:46,684 --> 00:14:49,753
He can't see
where they're --

303
00:14:49,753 --> 00:14:52,022
The trouble is they're
looking through the cameras.

304
00:14:52,022 --> 00:14:53,390
They can't always see
where they're going.

305
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,925
Look down,
look down, Ed.

306
00:14:54,925 --> 00:14:57,728
And they went right over
the edge of the cliff.

307
00:14:57,728 --> 00:15:00,330
Now, Ed is planning
to help them but first,

308
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:04,935
this is a Kodak
moment, is it not?

309
00:15:06,036 --> 00:15:09,139
So later that day,
Bill and Winston

310
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:11,909
are working hard and
choreographing all their moves

311
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:15,946
and all of a sudden both
of them together spot
the same bird.

312
00:15:15,946 --> 00:15:19,149
Which, at this point, I
guess is a spotted owl
would it not be?

313
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:20,884
Yes, indeed.

314
00:15:20,884 --> 00:15:22,953
Oh, they were pretty close.

315
00:15:22,953 --> 00:15:27,124
And it's rarely seen
except for K-Mart.

316
00:15:27,124 --> 00:15:29,693
So now they got a big
laugh out of it

317
00:15:29,693 --> 00:15:32,196
and try the bird calls.

318
00:15:37,301 --> 00:15:38,669
And he's --

319
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:40,337
No, he's getting an answer.
He's getting an --

320
00:15:40,337 --> 00:15:42,039
What is that, ohhh...

321
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:43,774
Gosh.

322
00:15:43,774 --> 00:15:46,743
Oh I see where
the answer is --

323
00:15:46,743 --> 00:15:49,980
You're talking
to each other, bird boys.

324
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,816
Yeah,
that's the problem.

325
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:55,485
Meanwhile, Ed goes
back to plan A.

326
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:57,854
He just drops the
birdseed down there.

327
00:15:57,854 --> 00:15:59,089
Might as well
give her the --

328
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:00,958
Yeah, go for it.

329
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,659
And he's got
the binoculars.

330
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:06,763
He's just gonna stay focused
on where he expects to
see some birds.

331
00:16:06,763 --> 00:16:08,665
So now, they're
trying the duck calls

332
00:16:08,665 --> 00:16:11,168
and they're getting
a response from --

333
00:16:11,168 --> 00:16:13,670
It's like a Mallard
or something.

334
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:18,141
Oh no, it's just
another duck decoy.

335
00:16:20,877 --> 00:16:23,580
Meanwhile, Ed has been gazing
in the sun too long.

336
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,716
He's asleep and they
spend the whole day

337
00:16:25,716 --> 00:16:28,652
and do not see
one bird.

338
00:16:41,665 --> 00:16:44,101
You know, one of
the downsides of the
Home Shopping Channel

339
00:16:44,101 --> 00:16:47,237
is that a lot of people
are baking their own
bread these days.

340
00:16:47,237 --> 00:16:49,673
Oh sure, the bread machines
can knead the dough

341
00:16:49,673 --> 00:16:51,775
and bake the bread,
but can they slice it?

342
00:16:51,775 --> 00:16:53,877
No.

343
00:16:53,877 --> 00:16:55,245
And just ripping
the loaf in half

344
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:58,415
or biting the end off
is not acceptable if
you have company.

345
00:16:58,415 --> 00:17:00,317
So what do you do?

346
00:17:00,317 --> 00:17:02,018
Well, I say
don't have company,

347
00:17:02,018 --> 00:17:03,854
but Bernice says otherwise.

348
00:17:03,854 --> 00:17:06,490
So you do what
your ancestors did...

349
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,025
You get out your autoharp.

350
00:17:09,025 --> 00:17:11,394
Now, the autoharp is
a traditional instrument,

351
00:17:11,394 --> 00:17:14,998
very popular for the first
two weeks of August in 1963.

352
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:19,136
It looks like somebody mated
a banjo and a washboard

353
00:17:19,136 --> 00:17:22,405
but it sounds like they
mated a couple of cats.

354
00:17:22,405 --> 00:17:25,475
Okay, for my purposes,
I hacked the back out
of this unit.

355
00:17:25,475 --> 00:17:28,478
You might wonder how I could do
that to a valuable instrument

356
00:17:28,478 --> 00:17:31,381
but hey, it's Harold's.

357
00:17:31,381 --> 00:17:33,817
Anyway, we don't
need an instrument,

358
00:17:33,817 --> 00:17:36,786
we need a tool.

359
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,059
You might say this is the
greatest thing since...

360
00:17:44,861 --> 00:17:47,531
Man, don't you hate
when that happens?

361
00:17:51,768 --> 00:17:53,737
And for my next number,

362
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:56,806
here's a little
thing by bread.

363
00:17:56,806 --> 00:17:58,842
If the women don't
find you handsome

364
00:17:58,842 --> 00:18:01,912
they should at least
find you handy

365
00:18:12,689 --> 00:18:15,158
Well, that's it
for today's show.

366
00:18:15,158 --> 00:18:17,394
Oh no you don't!
No, no, no!

367
00:18:17,394 --> 00:18:18,728
You explain to them
what happened!

368
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:22,365
You tell them.
Go, go, go!

369
00:18:22,365 --> 00:18:24,300
Nobody cares, Harold.

370
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,836
No, of course not but no,
I think you have to go

371
00:18:26,836 --> 00:18:28,371
through the experience
of confessing --

372
00:18:28,371 --> 00:18:29,839
well, explaining
what went wrong

373
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,276
so we can all learn
from your mistakes.

374
00:18:33,276 --> 00:18:35,111
Okay, well maybe not all.

375
00:18:35,111 --> 00:18:37,047
I mean everybody but you.

376
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:41,384
All right, the New
Yorkshire Puddings
were not a hit.

377
00:18:41,384 --> 00:18:43,086
Okay, even though we
had a great slogan,

378
00:18:43,086 --> 00:18:45,188
"A Taste of New York."

379
00:18:45,188 --> 00:18:48,925
Which was true, you know,
if you include the East River.

380
00:18:48,925 --> 00:18:50,360
He made like
a thousand of these.

381
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,928
I said that was too
much for a test run.

382
00:18:51,928 --> 00:18:53,563
I said that was too
much for a test run.

383
00:18:53,563 --> 00:18:55,632
Well, you got to prepare
for success, Harold.

384
00:18:55,632 --> 00:18:58,435
Not around here,
you don't.

385
00:18:58,435 --> 00:19:00,537
So, you know,
by four o'clock

386
00:19:00,537 --> 00:19:02,439
we'd roughly sold...

387
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:03,673
none.

388
00:19:03,673 --> 00:19:05,041
So we went
to "Plan B."

389
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,477
Tell them what "Plan B" was.
Tell them what "Plan B" was.

390
00:19:07,477 --> 00:19:11,014
We sold them
as animal feed.

391
00:19:11,014 --> 00:19:12,849
To what kind
of animals?

392
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:14,918
Horses.
Horses, yes!

393
00:19:14,918 --> 00:19:16,186
And how did that go?

394
00:19:16,186 --> 00:19:18,388
Not great.
No.

395
00:19:18,388 --> 00:19:20,223
The problem was
a pile of fresh ones

396
00:19:20,223 --> 00:19:22,592
look identical to
a pile of eaten ones.

397
00:19:25,195 --> 00:19:27,063
This is not
helping, Harold.

398
00:19:27,063 --> 00:19:29,566

The good part?

402

We dumped them all
into the Possum Lake.

Yeah... And?

404
