1
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:05,238
HERE'S HOW TO KEEP KIDS
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

2
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:08,241
HANG A TIRE FROM A TREE;
TELL THEM TO SWING IN IT.

3
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:09,743
TH'S CHEAP...IN A GOOD WAY.

4
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,245
WHY STOP AT TIRES --
IF YOU MUST HANG A CAR

5
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:15,148
PART AND CONVINCE THEM
IT'S FUN, WHY STOP AT TIRES?

6
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:16,750
HOW ABOUT A WINDSHIELD, EH?

7
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:19,753
HANG THAT, EH, AND THE KIDS CAN
PRESS THEIR FACE AGAINST IT.

8
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:21,254
LOOK AT THAT. ISN'T THAT GREAT?

9
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,756
KIDS LOVE THAT.

10
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:24,257
[laughing]

11
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:25,759
HOW ABOUT THIS?

12
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:28,194
YOU KNOW HOW KIDS LOVE
THOSE MEXICAN PINATAS.

13
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:31,264
WELL, HOW ABOUT USING
A CAR GAS TANK, EH, AS A PINATA?

14
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,767
TAKE THEM ALL SUMMER TO BREAK
THIS BABY OPEN.

15
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,036
UNLESS THEY HIT IT WITH
A THREE OUGHT THREE.

16
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:38,738
OR HANG A BUMPER ON THERE.

17
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:41,374
GIVE YOU KIND OF A NIFTY
TEETER-TOTTER SWING THING.

18
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:44,444
ALL RIGHT, OR A...

19
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:47,914
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THEY'D DO WITH THIS.

20
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,817
BUT WHY NOT GO FOR
THE WHOLE ENCHILADA, HEY?

21
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,119
HANG A WHOLE CAR FROM A TREE.

22
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:55,789
[crashing]

23
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:58,024
OH, YEAH, REMIND THEM TO WEAR
THEIR SEATBELTS.

24
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,262
IT'S THE RED GREEN SHOW!

25
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:03,763
HA, HA, HA.

26
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,499
AND NOW HERE HE IS,
THE MAN WHO BEAT THE ODDS

27
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,002
EVEN THOUGH HE'S ONE OF THEM,
YOUR HOST AND HERO,

28
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,737
BUT HE'S MY UNCLE, RED GREEN!

29
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,873
[cheering]

30
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,875
YEAH.

31
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:17,744
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

32
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,245
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

33
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:20,747
I APPRECIATE IT.

34
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,149
IS THERE ANYBODY OUT THERE
WHO HAS A USED HEAVY-DUTY

35
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:26,252
12-VOLT TRUCK HORN, EH...

36
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,754
AT A REASONABLE PRICE?

37
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:30,423
I TELL YOU, I'D BE
INTERESTED IN THAT.

38
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,226
DID YOU BURN OUT THE HORN
ON THE POSSUM VAN AGAIN?

39
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,830
UH...

40
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,001
YOU KNOW,
I BELIEVE I DID, HAROLD.

41
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,237
YOU THINK SO? THAT'S
THE FOURTH HORN THIS YEAR.

42
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,973
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
BACK OFF ON THE HORN HONKING.

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,476
YEAH? WELL, MAYBE YOU
OUGHT TO JUST BACK OFF.

44
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:50,977
WHOA.

45
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,280
I'M JUST SAYING THAT HORNS
ARE USED FOR EMERGENCIES.

46
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,649
THEY'RE NOT SUBSTITUTES
FOR TURNING SIGNALS AND BRAKES.

47
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,454
YOU SHOULDN'T BE BOTHERING
OUR VIEWERS WITH THIS, EITHER.

48
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,957
GO TO McCLINTOCK'S SALVAGE YARD.
HE'S GOT LOTS OF HORNS.

49
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:06,226
DRIVE YOURSELF THERE,
PICK UP ONE OF HIS HORNS.

50
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:10,230
HAROLD, HOW CAN
I DRIVE WITHOUT A HORN?

51
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,232
HOW ARE THE OTHER DRIVERS
GOING TO KNOW

52
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,033
WHAT THEY'RE DOING WRONG?

53
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,270
HANG YOUR HEAD OUT THE SIDE
AND JUST YELL AT 'EM.

54
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:21,241
HONK! HONK! HONK!

55
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,042
HEY, HEY, WHY DON'T
YOU COME ALONG?

56
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,544
YOU CAN BE
MY HORN.

57
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:28,548
I DON'T WANT-- HOW AM I GOING
TO KNOW WHEN YOU WANT TO HONK?

58
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,917
YOU'LL FEEL THE TINGLE.
YOU'LL BE ON THE WIRES.

59
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,485
COME ON.

60
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,893
IT'S TIME TO PLAY
THE POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME.

61
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,895
AND TONIGHT'S CONTESTANT
IS MR. WINSTON ROTHSCHILD

62
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:45,932
OF THE ROTHSCHILD SEWAGE
AND SEPTIC SUCKING SERVICES.

63
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,535
AND TONIGHT MR. ROTHSCHILD
IS PLAYING FOR THE FANTASTIC

64
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:53,039
GRAND PRIZE OF AN ENTIRE BAG OF
AFTER-DINNER MINTS, HA, HA, HA.

65
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,181
AN ENTIRE BAG OF MOTHBALLS.

66
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,127
ACK-ACK.

67
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:18,164
UNCLE RED...

68
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:21,734
YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS TO GET
MR. ROTHSCHILD TO SAY THIS WORD:

69
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:25,738
SMELL...SMELL.

70
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,240
YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
HAROLD.

71
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,741
OK, GO.

72
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,243
ALL RIGHT, WINSTON,
WHEN YOU DRIVE

73
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,845
YOUR SEWAGE TRUCK
INTO TOWN, THE GUYS

74
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,414
ALL SAY,
"WHAT'S THAT..."

75
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,915
WORTH?

76
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:40,153
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE THING
THAT MAKES THEIR EYES WATER.

77
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,055
OH, YEAH, YEAH, ENVY.

78
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:43,556
HEH.

79
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:46,059
OK, WINSTON, I KNOW YOU
PUT A LOT OF TIME

80
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,560
AND EFFORT
INTO YOUR BUSINESS, RIGHT.

81
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,396
BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO STOP
AND SOMETHING THE ROSES.

82
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:51,998
FERTILIZE.

83
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,703
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
YOU GOT FIVE SENSES:

84
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,772
SIGHT, HEARING,
TASTE, TOUCH AND...

85
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,274
DIRECTION.

86
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:06,446
OSCAR WILDE WAS TALKING
ABOUT BAGPIPES -- HE SAID,

87
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:08,615
"THANK GOD THERE'S NO..."

88
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,284
SPIT VALVE.

89
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,720
ALMOST OUT OF TIME, UNCLE RED.

90
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:16,022
I KNOW, I KNOW.
OH, I KNOW.

91
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,557
REMEMBER YOU GOT
THE CONTRACT TO

92
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,727
PUMP OUT ALL THE SEPTICS AT
THE PORT ASBESTOS PRUNE FAIR?

93
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:23,730
WHAT DID YOU CALL THAT?

94
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,231
THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS.

95
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,966
[ringing]

96
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,774
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO EMBARRASSED
IN ALL MY LIFE.

97
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,776
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE --
YOU WERE CUTTING PEOPLE OFF,

98
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,045
YOU DROVE THROUGH INTERSECTIONS,
YOU DROVE THROUGH A DITCH

99
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,546
JUST TO PASS BUSTER HADFIELD.

100
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,282
WELL, HAROLD, I
MEAN, HE WAS GOING

101
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,284
SO SLOW -- THE
SPEED LIMIT IS 60,

102
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,186
AND HE WAS ONLY
DOING ABOUT 80.

103
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,489
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GOT?
KNOW WHAT YOU GOT?

104
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:50,990
ROAD RAGE, YEAH.

105
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,925
YOU GOT A BAD TEMPER,
THAT AIN'T NORMAL.

106
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:56,296
I DON'T HAVE A BAD TEMPER.

107
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:59,165
MAYBE NOT, BUT
YOU'RE A CARRIER.

108
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,039
YOU NEED HELP, UNCLE RED.

109
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,774
WELL, I KNOW,
I KNOW THAT, HAROLD.

110
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,244
AND I'VE TRIED, BUT I CAN'T
GET AN INSTITUTION TO TAKE YOU.

111
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,812
[laughing]

112
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,314
YEAH, OK, I KNOW,

113
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,082
WE JOKE AROUND A LOT
AND EVERYTHING,

114
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,351
BUT YOU HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM
MANAGING YOUR ANGER.

115
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,354
I KNOW ALL THESE THINGS, 'CAUSE
I JUST FINISHED WRITING A PAPER

116
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,590
FOR MY PSYCH CLASS 101, AND YOU
HAVE THE SYMPTOMS OF A PERSON

117
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,694
WHO MUST LEARN HOW TO MANAGE
THEIR ANGER -- I CAN HELP YOU.

118
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,429
I DON'T NEED TO MANAGE MY ANGER.

119
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,731
I NEED PEOPLE TO STOP
TICKING ME OFF.

120
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,966
WHY CAN'T PEOPLE
JUST SMARTEN UP?

121
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,869
GIVE ME SOME SPACE, YOU KNOW?
HOW ABOUT THIS?

122
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:40,540
WHY DON'T THEY JUST STAY INDOORS
WHEN I'M DRIVING?

123
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,475
IT'S NOT THEM, IT'S YOU.

124
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,410
YOU CAN CHANGE IF YOU WANT TO.

125
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,879
YOU SOUND LIKE MY WIFE,
YOU KNOW THAT?

126
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:50,116
NO, I THINK WE SHOULD
JUST GO SOMEWHERE PRIVATE

127
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,051
AND TALK ABOUT
THIS SORT OF THING --

128
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,553
LIKE WHAT MAKES YOU ANGRY?

129
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,054
STUPID MORONS.

130
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,556
STUPID MORONS, OK.

131
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,057
CAN YOU NAME ANY STUPID MORONS?

132
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:59,559
HOW MUCH TIME HAVE YOU GOT?

133
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,794
SEE, THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM,
IS THAT YOU DON'T RESPECT

134
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,796
OTHER DRIVERS -- THEY CAN'T
ALL BE STUPID MORONS.

135
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,099
WELL, THAT'S WHAT I KEEP HOPING.

136
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:12,138
ONE OF THE GREATEST LESSONS
I LEARNED FROM MY MOTHER IS

137
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,407
YOU DON'T THROW SOMETHING OUT
JUST BECAUSE IT'S USELESS.

138
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,576
SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT DAD.

139
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:20,580
BUT I'D LIKE TO APPLY
THE SAME PRINCIPLE...

140
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,181
TO THIS OLD CHAIR.

141
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,083
IT GOT BROKEN
WHEN BUSTER HADFIELD

142
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,285
LEANED BACK ON IT,
NOT REALIZING IT

143
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,855
WASN'T A RECLINER
EVEN THOUGH HE IS.

144
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,326
SO THIS WEEK
ON THE HANDYMAN CORNER,

145
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,595
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU
A WAY TO PUT

146
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,097
FANCY BACKS ON ALL
OF THESE OLD CHAIRS.

147
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:41,067
BUSTER'S A BIT
OF A SLOW LEARNER.

148
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:44,103
THIS IS A STYLE YOU DON'T
SEE THAT MUCH OF ANY MORE.

149
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,105
IT'S CALLED CANING.

150
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,107
THEY USED TO DO A LOT OF THAT.

151
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,376
THE WORKERS WOULD CANE
THE CHAIRS AND THE BOSSES

152
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:51,878
WOULD CANE THE WORKERS.

153
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:55,047
THIS IS WOOD HERE, AND THEY BEND
THAT INTO A SHAPE LIKE THAT,

154
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,049
WHICH, TO ME,
LOOKS VERY DIFFICULT

155
00:06:57,116 --> 00:07:00,353
AND EXTREMELY TIME-CONSUMING,
WHICH ARE TWO NO-NOs

156
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,021
FOR MY KIND OF HANDYMAN.

157
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,425
NOW, I SUPPOSE YOU COULD TRUDGE
THROUGH THE WOODS

158
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,460
UNTIL YOU FOUND A TREE
THAT WAS GROWING

159
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,797
THE EXACT SHAPE OF A CHAIR BACK,
BUT I PREFER TO USE MATERIAL

160
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,799
A LITTLE EASIER
TO WORK WITH THAN WOOD.

161
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,734
I'M THINKING GARDEN HOSE.

162
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,770
NOW HERE YOU COULD CUT THE HOSE
INTO THE EXACT LENGTHS

163
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,273
THAT YOU NEED,
BUT I PREFER TO JUST DO

164
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,275
KIND OF A RANDOM
SLICE-O-MATIC THING

165
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,811
AND THEN JUST ADAPT
TO WHATEVER I GET.

166
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,146
I LOVE A CHALLENGE.

167
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,583
[motor whirring]

168
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:37,757
YEAH, ALWAYS WEAR YOUR GOGGLES
WHEN YOU REACH

169
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,193
INTO A LAWN MOWER -- SAFETY.

170
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,695
OK, NOW WHAT YOU
WANT TO DO IS TAKE

171
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,530
YOUR VARIOUS PIECES
OF YOUR GARDEN HOSE,

172
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:49,602
AND YOU WANT TO RE-CREATE
THE CANE-BACK LOOK EXACTLY.

173
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,038
AND YOU WANT TO ATTACH
THAT ON THERE USING

174
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:55,107
THE FURNITURE BUILDER'S
SECRET WEAPON...DUCT TAPE.

175
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:00,313
ALL RIGHT, WE GOT OUR BASIC
SHAPE DONE THERE,

176
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,515
AND I'LL TELL YOU,
ONCE YOU COVER THAT WITH

177
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:05,117
THE VINYL WOOD-GRAINED
TRIM THERE, I DEFY ANYBODY

178
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:08,821
TO TELL THAT
FROM THE ORIGINAL, HUH?

179
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,757
OH, RIGHT, YEAH, YEAH,
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

180
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,526
MM-HMM, MM-HMM, YEAH,
I FORGOT ONE THING.

181
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,528
UM, THEY'RE
A BIT TOO FLIMSY, YOU KNOW.

182
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,831
BECAUSE VERY FEW GARDEN HOSES
WERE EVER DESIGNED TO HOLD

183
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,167
THE WEIGHT OF AN ADULT HUMAN.

184
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:24,437
SO, WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS
WE GOT TO REINFORCE THE UNIT

185
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,540
BY FILING THE HOSES
WITH CEMENT, EH?

186
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:31,177
I JUST, UH, POUR THIS CEMENT
DOWN THE INSIDE OF THE...

187
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,813
HOSE THERE -- YOU MIGHT
HAVE TO SHAKE HER DOWN.

188
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,350
IT MIGHT TAKE A MINUTE
OR TWO TO SLIDE DOWN THERE.

189
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,654
ALL RIGHT, ACTUALLY, ACTUALLY,
TO GET THE CEMENT DOWN THERE,

190
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:45,424
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU
WANT TO WIPE THE END OF THE HOSE

191
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,927
LIKE THAT, AND THEN YOU
WANT TO ACTUALLY BLOW ON,

192
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,096
YOU WANT TO BLOW ON THAT.

193
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,398
I'M ALONE. ALL RIGHT.

194
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:56,269
JUST BLOW ON THAT
AND BLOW THE CEMENT DOWN.

195
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,542
ALL RIGHT, ACTUALLY TO GET
THE CEMENT DOWN THERE,

196
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,043
IT'S PRETTY-- IT'S PRETTY THICK.

197
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,045
SO YOU GOT TO BLOW
REALLY, REALLY HARD.

198
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,547
REALLY...

199
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,649
[inhaling]

200
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:17,056
OK, AND ONCE THE CEMENT
HAS HARDENED INSIDE THE HOSES,

201
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,559
ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS --
AS I SAID BEFORE --

202
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,561
COVER THEM WITH THE VINYL
FAKE WOOD STUFF,

203
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,563
AND YOU GOT YOURSELF
A BEAUTIFUL CHAIR.

204
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,565
IT'S EVERY BIT AS GOOD
AS THE ORIGINAL.

205
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:29,569
IN FACT, THESE CHAIRS ARE
STURDIER, THEY'RE STRONGER...

206
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,504
THEY'RE HEAVIER.

207
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,873
YEAH, WELL, THE CEMENT IN THE
BACK, THEY HAVE

208
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,108
A TENDENCY NOW
TO FALL OVER BACKWARDS.

209
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:39,111
SO, WHAT YOU COULD DO THERE
IS JUST EITHER BOLT THEM DOWN

210
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:40,846
OR JUST...SIT IN THEM ALL DAY.

211
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,582
HEY, AS IF YOU NEED AN EXCUSE.

212
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:46,118
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME...

213
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,891
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

214
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:04,537
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU OLDER GUYS
THAT HAVE NO WAR STORIES.

215
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,806
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE TOO YOUNG
FOR KOREA

216
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,708
AND TOO OLD FOR DESERT STORM.

217
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,177
YOU KNOW, YOU GET
TO A CERTAIN AGE,

218
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,379
PEOPLE REALLY EXPECT YOU
TO HAVE A WAR STORY.

219
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,414
SO HERE'S WHAT YOU DO,
ALL RIGHT?

220
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:18,985
YOU TAKE THE CRAPPIEST EVENT
IN YOUR LIFE...

221
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,954
MAYBE A CRUMMY JOB
OR A GOOFY FRIEND,

222
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,690
HOW ABOUT YOUR FIRST WEDDING?

223
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:29,328
AND YOU TURN THAT
INTO YOUR WAR STORY.

224
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,364
AH, YEAH,
I WAS IN THE WAR, YEAH.

225
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,032
AH, YEAH, THE BIG ONE.

226
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,301
GASOLINE PRICE WAR OF '69.

227
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:38,971
I'D LIED ABOUT MY AGE
TO GET A SUMMER JOB

228
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,007
PUMPING GAS AT LLOYD'S TEXACO.

229
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:45,511
THEN ALL SHELL BROKE LOOSE.

230
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,347
THE DUTCHMAN DROPPED
HIS PRICE BY A NICKEL.

231
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,416
WE HAD TO FIGHT BACK.

232
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,853
SO WE TOOK THE BIG HIT, AND WE
DROPPED OURS DOWN BY SIX CENTS.

233
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,821
WAR WAS ON.

234
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:59,225
WHY, WE STARTED HANDING OUT
HOT DOGS AND BALLOONS

235
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,993
JUST TO KEEP THE CUSTOMERS.

236
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,263
BY THE END OF AUGUST, THE WHOLE
STATION WAS UNDER SIEGE.

237
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,200
CARS LINED UP OUTSIDE,
FIRING OFF THEIR HORNS,

238
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,102
SCREAMING FOR FREE TUMBLERS.

239
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:15,908
AND NOBODY TO HOLD THEM OFF
EXCEPT ME AND ONE-LEGGED LLOYD.

240
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:21,147
BUT WE DID IT, AND WE WON.

241
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,449
AND IT MADE A MAN OUT OF ME.

242
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:27,086
AND I GUESS THAT EXPLAINS
THE STAIN ON MY PANTS.

243
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,856
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

244
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,992
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

245
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,330
ALL SET?

246
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:40,332
YEAH.

247
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,902
YOU ARE A NOTHING!
YOU ARE A ZERO!

248
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,071
YOU ARE LESS THAN ZERO, YOU ARE

249
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,440
A ZERO-A-MATIC -- YOU HAVE
NOTHING, YOU DO NOTHING!

250
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,476
YOU ARE A NOTHING!

251
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,977
YOU MAKE ME SICK!

252
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,713
[spitting and coughing]

253
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,522
YOU DID REALLY WELL.

254
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,024
I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU.

255
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,525
I THINK, I THINK
I'M OVER

256
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,027
THE HUMP
ON THIS.

257
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,296
YEAH, SO YOU'VE BEEN DOING
YOUR DETACHING AND PROJECTING

258
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:11,797
AND TRANSFERRING EXERCISES.

259
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,799
DETRACTING FROM THE NOW,
PROJECTING INTO THE PAST

260
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,468
AND TRANSFERRING INTO
A POSITIVE EMOTION.

261
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,203
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT

262
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,205
I DID, I'LL TELL
YOU WHAT I DID.

263
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:20,706
I CONCENTRATED.
I THOUGHT ABOUT--

264
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,476
A FEW MINUTES AGO, I WAS
OUT WALKING AROUND THE LODGE.

265
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:24,977
AND I WENT BY YOUR CABIN.

266
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,979
AND I WENT INSIDE,
AND I PICKED UP

267
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,748
ALL YOUR STUFF,
AND I DETACHED, PROJECTED

268
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,516
AND TRANSFERRED
IT ALL INTO THE LAKE.

269
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,318
YEAH!

270
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,320
WELCOME TO
THE EXPERTS PORTION OF THE SHOW.

271
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:37,323
THIS IS WHERE WE LIKE TO EXAMINE
THOSE THREE LITTLE WORDS

272
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,358
THAT MEN FIND SO HARD TO SAY:

273
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,327
I DON'T KNOW.

274
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,762
YEAH.

275
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,764
HA, ALL RIGHTY,
JOINING MY UNCLE RED TODAY

276
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,099
IS MR. DALTON HUMPHREY OF
THE HUMPHREY EVERYTHING STORE.

277
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,069
WE'VE GOT STUFF...

278
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,439
MAYBE BUY SOME.

279
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,309
[cheering]

280
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,349
SIMPLE YET SIMPLE.

281
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:04,850
OK...

282
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,352
[laughing]

283
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:09,355
A VIEWER IN KANSAS CITY
WRITES US TODAY, AND THEY WRITE:

284
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:10,856
"DEAR EXPERTS,
MY FRIENDS OR FAMILY"

285
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,358
"DO THINGS THAT REALLY BUG ME."

286
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,093
"IS IT ME OR WHAT?"

287
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,628
SOUNDS LIKE
IT, YEAH.

288
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:19,832
NO, NO, NO, NOT
NECESSARILY TRUE, YOU KNOW.

289
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,500
I USUALLY FIND IT'S THEM.

290
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,736
BUT YOU CAN FORCE
PEOPLE TO CHANGE.

291
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:27,072
IT'S NOT EASY,
BUT YOU OWE IT TO THEM.

292
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,408
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF THE TERM "CONTROL FREAK"?

293
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,910
OH, YEAH.

294
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,646
OH, YEAH, MY BROTHER-IN-LAW'S
ONE OF THOSE.

295
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:37,449
I'M WORKING ON
CHANGING HIM, THOUGH.

296
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,952
YOU CAN WORK AS HARD
AS YOU WANT ON TRYING

297
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,122
TO CHANGE PEOPLE, BUT YOU'LL
SPEND A LOT OF TIME DOING THAT;

298
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,891
THE MINUTE YOU LEAVE THE ROOM,
THEY'LL REVERT TO THEMSELVES.

299
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,893
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST
LEARN TO ACCEPT PEOPLE

300
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,562
FOR WHO THEY ARE
AND BE FORGIVING.

301
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,464
I THINK I'D BE TALKING
TO YOU THERE, BERNICE.

302
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:58,537
YOU KNOW, THAT IS
SUCH A COP-OUT.

303
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,506
WHAT KIND OF FATHER WOULD

304
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,409
I BE IF I DIDN'T REMIND
PEOPLE TO USE COASTERS

305
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,311
AND TO TUCK IN
THE SHOWER CURTAIN

306
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,580
AND TO LOAD THE DISHWASHER
PROPERLY -- BIG PLATES

307
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,315
AT THE BACK, BOWLS ON THE RIGHT,

308
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:10,816
SAUCERS ON THE LEFT.

309
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,852
IMAGINE THE CHAOS.

310
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,854
HUH? AND WHEN MY DAUGHTER
GOES OUT WITH

311
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,956
HER BOYFRIEND FOR A DRIVE,
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

312
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,558
IF I DIDN'T YELL OUT,
"DRIVE CAREFULLY!"

313
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,261
"DON'T HAVE AN ACCIDENT!" --
WHAT THEN, HUH?

314
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,762
I'VE SEEN HIM DRIVE.

315
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:26,398
HE'S A PRETTY SAFE DRIVER.

316
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,300
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, RED.

317
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,369
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

318
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,372
SO YOU DON'T TELL ME THAT WE
SHOULDN'T HELP OUT THE PEOPLE

319
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,242
AROUND US BY POINTING OUT
WHAT THEY'RE DOING WRONG.

320
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:39,245
I'M GLAD YOU FEEL THAT WAY,
'CAUSE I FEEL YOU'RE TOO BOSSY,

321
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,013
YOU'RE TOO NOSY
AND YOU ALWAYS LIKE--

322
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,682
WHAT? I DON'T
HAVE TO TAKE THAT FROM YOU.

323
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,517
EXCUSE ME.

324
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,494
DID I SAY
SOMETHING WRONG?

325
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,830
I DON'T THINK SO.
HE LEFT, DIDN'T HE?

326
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:04,370
[ RED ]: BILL HAD ASKED ME
TO MEET HIM IN THE WOODS.

327
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,372
OH, THERE HE IS.
I'M RIGHT HERE, BILL.

328
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,774
OH, OH.

329
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,776
NOW HE'S HERE.

330
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,878
OH, NO, THAT'S YOUR BIKE, BILL.

331
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,847
I THINK YOU'LL NEED
A BIKE YOURSELF.

332
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,515
I DON'T QUITE KNOW.

333
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,417
OH, HE'S FINE, HE'S FINE.

334
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,119
HI, THERE...

335
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,987
COUPLE OF BRANCH OFFICES THERE.

00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,522
YEAH, I'M FINE, I'M FINE.

337
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,057
WHAT'S UP? WHAT ARE WE DOING?

338
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,626
THAT'S NOT A HILL.
THAT'S A MOUNTAIN, MAN.

339
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,628
THAT'S A MOUNTAIN.
I'M NOT GOING UP THERE.

340
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,297
I GOT TO WALK UP?

341
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:32,798
WE'RE GOING TO RACE?

342
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,800
OH, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

343
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,469
OOH, MUST HAVE HIT
THE POINT THERE, BILL.

344
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,806
AH, ALL RIGHT, OK, I'M NOT
GOING TO WALK, BUT I'LL RACE.

345
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,008
YOU WALK; I'M GOING
TO GO ON MY BIKE.

346
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,010
NO PROBLEM, NO PROBLEM.
I'M UP FOR IT.

347
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,712
WATCH THE SEAT. IT LOOKS LOOSE.

348
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,247
THE SEAT LOOKS LOOSE, UH-OH.

349
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,748
OH, OH,

350
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,350
THAT'S GOT TO--

351
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:54,486
OH, THERE'S A LITTLE BRANCH.
THERE'S A BRANCH HERE.

352
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,088
WATCH OUT FOR THBRANCH, BILL.

353
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:59,892
BILL, THERE'S A BRANCH, BILL.

354
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,794
THERE'S A BRANCH.
CAN YOU SEE THE BRANCH?

355
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,696
[ THUDDING ]
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

356
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,297
OH, BOY.

357
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:09,268
NO, IT DIDN'T QUITE MAKE IT --
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT.

358
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,340
YEAH, YOU'RE FINE.

359
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:15,908
OH!

360
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,010
SO, I'M,

361
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:21,146
I'M MAKING GOOD TIME, AND START
AGAIN, BILL. WAY YOU GO.

362
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,082
THERE I AM AT THE TOP THERE.

363
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,250
I MADE IT. I GUESS I WIN.

364
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,052
COME ON, BILL. YOU COMING?

365
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:30,255
HERE HE COMES, HERE HE COMES.

366
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,025
OH, HERE'S A CLASSIC MOMENT --
YOU CAN FEEL IT, EH?

367
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,327
LOOK AT THAT. HUH?

368
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,629
OH, OH, OH!

369
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:41,066
I DIDN'T KNOW
WE WERE RACING BACK DOWN.

370
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:44,269
OH, OH, OH!

371
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,804
DOES THIS MEAN I LOST?

372
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:48,040
OH, NO, HE LOST.

373
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,709
YOU ALL RIGHT, BILL?

374
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,746
NOW HE'S FINE.

375
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,247
OH!

376
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,750
OH!

377
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,518
OH!

378
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,056
RANGER GORD ASKED ME IF HE COULD

379
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:07,059
COME ON HERE AND SING
A NEW SONG ABOUT HIS HOBBY.

380
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,627
HE'S GOT A NEW HOBBY APPARENTLY.

381
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:12,197
AND, YOU KNOW, BEAR IN MIND, WE
HAVE A WHOLE HALF HOUR TO FILL.

382
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:13,766
SO I'M THINKING...

383
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,202
I'M THINKING, YEAH.

384
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,704
THAT'S GREAT,
RANGER GORD,

385
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,205
YOU'RE GOING TO
PLAY THE GUITAR.

386
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,707
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU COULD EVEN

387
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,208
PLAY THE GUITAR.

388
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:26,111
REALLY, HAROLD, I'M SHOCKED.

389
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:28,847
WHAT ABOUT ALL THOSE TIMES
WE SAT AROUND THE CAMP FIRE

390
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,582
SINGING CAMP FIRE SONGS --
REMEMBER THAT?

391
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,519
I HAD A BEARD AND POT BELLY,
SORT OF SOUNDED LIKE THIS.

392
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,220
REMEMBER THAT?

393
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,792
THAT WAS
UNCLE RED AND I.

394
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,360
YEAH.

395
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:45,230
OH, YEAH, RIGHT, OK.

396
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,302
OK, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

397
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:53,205
INSTEAD OF A SONG,
I'M GOING TO DO A POEM

398
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,307
ABOUT MY NEW HOBBY, OK?

399
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,311
NOT ALL POEMS
HAVE TO RHYME, DO THEY?

400
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,813
NO, NO, POEMS
DON'T HAVE TO

401
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,314
RHYME AND THEY
DON'T HAVE TO

402
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,882
BE DIRTY, BUT
PEOPLE PREFER IT.

403
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,819
ALL RIGHT, OK.

404
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:08,320
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING NOW?

405
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:11,323
I THINK WHAT I'M GOING TO DO
IS MORE OF A SPEECH

406
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,825
ABOUT MY NEW HOBBY, OK?

407
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,726
AW, SPEECHES
ARE GREAT.

408
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:16,728
SPEECHES ARE GOOD.
THAT'S VERY BRAVE OF YOU.

409
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:19,631
MANY PEOPLE DISLIKE PUBLIC
SPEAKING, SO IT'S BRAVE -- GO.

410
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:22,101
REALLY? WHY?

411
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,836
WHY?

412
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,337
[giggling]

413
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,839
IT'S PUBLIC SPEAKING.

414
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,475
YOU'RE SPEAKING TO THE PUBLIC;
THEY'RE ALL WATCHING YOU.

415
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,911
WHAT IF YOU FAIL?

416
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,546
SEE WHAT THEY'RE
DOING, EH?

417
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,782
THEY'RE
JUDGING YOU.
JUDGING YOU.

418
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,283
YOU.
JUDGING YOU.

419
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,785
YOU.
YEAH.

420
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,520
THEY'RE SAYING,
"IS HE INTERESTING OR WHAT?"

421
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,789
AND THIS IS WHY WHEN
YOU GET UP THERE...

422
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,290
THEY JUDGE YOU.
JUST YOU.

423
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:47,292
AND SOMETIMES
THEY THINK YOU'RE BAD.

424
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,794
REAL BAD.

425
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,295
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE GET NERVOUS.

426
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:51,797
REAL NERVOUS.

427
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,799
TERRIBLE.

428
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,300
NERVOUS LIKE...

429
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,802
CAN'T TALK.

430
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,403
W-W-WAHHH!

431
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,312
WEIRD.

432
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:08,881
ANYWAY, OK, HERE'S MY SPEECH.

433
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:11,817
AHEM.

434
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,319
I COLLECT SPIDERS
IN MY SPARE TIME.

435
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:15,821
THE END.

436
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:19,124
OK, I GUESS THERE'S TIME
FOR SOME QUESTIONS.

437
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:22,361
YOU KNOW, EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE
I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT HAROLD

438
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:23,862
DOES KNOW WHAT
HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

439
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,864
THIS ANGER MANAGEMENT PLAN
HE'S GOT ME ON

440
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,867
IS WORKING OUT GREAT -- TURNS
OUT MY PROBLEM WAS I WASN'T

441
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,369
DELEGATING ENOUGH
RESPONSIBILITY.

442
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:33,372
SO NOW I GOT HAROLD DEALING
WITH ALL THE LODGE MEMBERS

443
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:34,873
AND RUNNING ERRANDS FOR ME.

444
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,976
I HAVE NEVER FELT BETTER.

445
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:42,314
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE!
WHAT IS IT?

446
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,450
WHAT IS IT -- IS THERE A PRIZE
FOR BEING THE STUPIDEST IDIOT IN

447
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,186
ALL OF POSSUM LAKE --
IS THAT IT?

448
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,688
IS THAT WHAT IT IS --
BECAUSE I'M TELLING YOU,

449
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,357
IT'S LIKE TRYING TO TALK TO
HALLOWEEN PUMPKINS OUT THERE.

450
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,092
DUHHH.

451
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:56,862
SO, UH, HAROLD.

452
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,730
DON'T YOU GET ON ME!

453
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:01,400
SO HOW'S IT
GOING?

454
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,902
OH, IT'S GOING GOOD, OH, YEAH.

455
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,904
OH, YEAH, MORON DRIVERS,
IDIOT SALES PEOPLE,

456
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:09,241
LODGE MEMBERS WITH I.Q.'s
LIKE ROOM TEMPERATURE MAYBE,

457
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,611
ROOM TEMPERATURE CELSIUS.

458
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,613
I LOOK FOR THE LIGHT
IN THEIR EYES,

459
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,382
I DO, I DO LOOK FOR
THE LIGHT IN THEIR EYES.

460
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:18,884
BULB'S BURNED OUT.

461
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,153
AND IT'S THOSE LITTLE
CHRISTMAS BULBS, TOO, YOU KNOW.

462
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:26,358
ONE'S GONE;
THE WHOLE ROW IS GONE.

463
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:27,859
AH, YOU KNOW...

464
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,394
[cheering]

465
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,029
IT'S AWFUL.

466
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,598
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU LIKE THIS.

467
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,833
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
ARE YOU STARTING ON ME?

468
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,902
YOU STARTING ON ME -- YOU WANT

469
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,503
A PIECE OF ME?

470
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,006
NO, HAROLD, I'M JUST SAYING
YOU MIGHT WANT TO

471
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,574
CONTROL THAT ANGER A LITTLE BIT.

472
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:45,110
CONTROL THE TEMPER.
SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE?

473
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,612
WHAT?

474
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:49,815
YOU SPENT SO MUCH TIME WORKING
ON MY ANGER MANAGEMENT

475
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:53,051
THAT YOU'VE LET YOUR OWN ANGER
GET OUT OF THE CAGE A BIT.

476
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:57,155
SEE, LOOK HOW ANGRY
YOU ARE, SEE?

477
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:59,691
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

478
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,194
WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

479
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,795
YOU CAN SEE SOMEBODY ABOUT THAT.

480
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,297
WELL, I THINK IT'S THE WAY

481
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,366
EVERYBODY
TREATS ME.
REALLY?

482
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,368
YES.
I THINK IT'S
YOUR LOOKS,

483
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,136
PERSONALITY, YOU
KNOW YOU'RE A GOOF.

484
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,438
WELL, IF YOU WOULDN'T
INSULT ME ALL THE TIME,

485
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:15,274
I WOULDN'T BE SO ANGRY.

486
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,775
BUT I WOULD,
SO IT'S A...

487
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,277
OH, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

488
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:19,778
[squealing]

489
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,380
OH, IT'S MEETING
TIME, UNCLE RED.

490
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,881
I'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.

491
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,383
OK, EXCELLENT.

492
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,884
DON'T GET MAD.

493
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,686
FOR WHAT?

494
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,187
GET EVEN.

495
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:30,889
ALL RIGHT, IF MY WIFE
IS WATCHING,

496
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,824
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

497
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:35,594
AND I LEARNED TODAY THAT
THE BEST WAY TO CONTROL ANGER

498
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,095
IS TO BE THE BOSS.

499
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:40,966
BUT OF COURSE, YOU KNEW THAT
ALL ALONG, DIDN'T YOU?

500
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,201
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

501
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:46,204
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND HAROLD
AND THE WHOLE GANG UP HERE

502
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:48,774
AT POSSUM LODGE,
YOU KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

503
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:55,414
YOU KNOW, SIT WHERE
YOUR DESIGNATED SEATS ARE...

504
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:22,307
