1
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:05,472
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

2
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:08,074
HERE'S THE MAN
WHO LOOKS BOTH WAYS

3
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:10,377
AFTER HE CROSSES THE STREET,

4
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:12,846
YOUR HERO, MY UNCLE, RED GREEN!

5
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:15,181
(Applause and cheering)

6
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:16,649
THANK YOU!

7
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:18,651
NICE OUTFIT, HAROLD.

8
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:20,286
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

9
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:21,921
THIS IS QUITE A DAY.

10
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:24,224
OUR CHESTS ARE SO PUFFED OUT

11
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,359
WITH PRIDE, THEY STICK OUT

12
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,428
ALMOST PAST OUR STOMACHS.

13
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,029
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS

14
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:31,498
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.

15
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:34,334
THE POSSUM LODGE
PEEWEE HOCKEY TEAM

16
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,136
WON THE REGIONAL FINALS!

17
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,238
(Cheering and whistling)

18
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:39,939
HOW ABOUT
THAT, HUH?

19
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:44,144
I GOTTA TELL YOU,
IT WAS CLASSIC HOCKEY.

20
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,914
HITTING, CROSS-CHECKING,
ELBOWING, LOTS OF BLOOD...

21
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,583
THAT WAS JUST THE PARENTS.

22
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,418
I SURE HOPE

23
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,821
THEY DON'T START A FOOD FIGHT
AT THE HOCKEY BANQUET.

24
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,856
THE PARENTS ARE HAVING
A BANQUET?

25
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:58,191
EXCELLENT!

26
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,627
OH, NO, NO, WE ARE.

27
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:03,663
WE SPONSORED THE TEAM AND
THEY'RE GOING TO THE FINALS.

28
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,100
IT'S UP TO US TO HAVE A BANQUET
FOR THEM -- IT'S TRADITION.

29
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:09,502
WE'LL BE BREAKING
THAT TRADITION.

30
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,171
NO, YOU CAN'T -- IT'S EXPECTED.

31
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,140
THE KIDS EXPECT IT,
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,

32
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:15,742
THE PARENTS EXPECT IT.

33
00:01:15,808 --> 00:01:17,911
YOU DON'T WANT TO UPSET THEM.

34
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:21,614
SURELY THE LODGE CAN THROW
A LITTLE HOCKEY BANQUET.

35
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:23,549
WELL, LET'S SEE.

36
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:27,287
THE LODGE HAS
ABOUT 23 BUCKS, HAROLD.

37
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:29,155
WE CAN'T USE ALL THAT

38
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:33,326
'CAUSE THE LODGE
HAS TO PICK UP MILK AND BREAD.

39
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:38,331
(Horns honking)

40
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,933
(Geese honking)

41
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,437
(Quacking)

42
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,909
(Red): YOU'RE LOOKIN'
AT SEGMENTS

43
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:51,678
FROM THIS PARTICULAR SHOW,

44
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,046
THE MAIN MESSAGE BEING,

45
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:55,682
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT CHANGING THE CHANNEL.

46
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:58,351
TO MAKE SENSE
OUT OF THIS PROGRAMME,

47
00:01:58,418 --> 00:01:59,685
YOU GOTTA GIVE IT

48
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,487
YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.

49
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,230
LOOKS LIKE WE'LL GO AHEAD
WITH THIS BANQUET

50
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:15,134
'CAUSE THE TEAM WE SPONSORED
WON THE DARN REGIONAL FINALS.

51
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,903
PRICE OF SUCCESS, I GUESS.

52
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:19,071
THEY GOT THE PARENTS COMING IN.

53
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:21,707
THEY WANT US TO CLEAN
THE LODGE A BIT.

54
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,146
(Audience laughing)

55
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,315
PROBABLY NEEDED IT ANYWAY.

56
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:30,817
UNCLE RED!

57
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:33,553
UNCLE RED, I GOT THE TROPHIES
FOR THE BANQUET.

58
00:02:33,619 --> 00:02:36,355
I GOT 'EM ALL -- THE M.V.P.,
THE M.V.P., THE M.V.P.,

59
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:39,559
THE M.V.P., M.V.P.,
AND THE M.M.V.V.P.P.

60
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,127
(Audience laughing)

61
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,763
YOU GOT FIVE
MOST VALUABLE PLAYER TROPHIES?

62
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,965
NO, NO, LET'S SEE -- GOT, UM...

63
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:48,267
THAT'S, UH,
MOST VOLATILE PLAYER...

64
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,602
(Laughing)

65
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,103
MOST VERBAL PROFANITY...

66
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,605
(Laughing)

67
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,107
MOST VULGAR PLAYER...

68
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:58,110
MOVING VIOLATION WITH A PUCK...

69
00:02:58,177 --> 00:02:59,912
(Laughing)

70
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:02,448
AND WHAT ABOUT
THE M.M.V.V.P.P.?

71
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:06,085
MAJOR MAIMING OF A VULNERABLE
VICTIM'S PRIVATE PARTS.

72
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:08,087
(Laughing and applause)

73
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:10,623
(Cheering)

74
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,124
WOW.

75
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:16,128
I DIDN'T GET
A MOST VALUABLE PLAYER TROPHY.

76
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,097
WHAT ABOUT
THIS BRASS CUP?

77
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,066
THIS IS THE THUMBSTON CUP.

78
00:03:20,132 --> 00:03:21,400
THAT'S
A BEAUTY.

79
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,936
DONATED BY DR. THUMBSTON,
THE DENTIST.

80
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,504
TEETH IN THERE, HAROLD?

81
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:29,175
WHATEVER PLAYER LOSES THE MOST
TEETH, THEY GO IN HERE.

82
00:03:29,241 --> 00:03:32,979
HE MAKES THEM INTO AN UPPER
OR LOWER PLATE, YOUR CHOICE.

83
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:34,313
THAT'S REALLY NEAT.

84
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,282
OH, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

85
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:40,052
SPEAKING OF CHEWING, HOW'S
THE PLANNING OF FOOD GOING?

86
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,721
IT'S ALL UNDER CONTROL.

87
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:43,089
HAVE A LITTLE FAITH.

88
00:03:43,155 --> 00:03:46,125
I HAVE FAITH,
THE TEAM HAS FAITH.

89
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:49,095
WHAT THEY'RE REALLY GONNA WANT
IS FOOD!

90
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:50,696
(Audience laughing)

91
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:53,599
(Red): HERE'S A TEASER
FOR THE ADVENTURE WITH BILL...

92
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,000
HI, BILL.

93
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:58,070
... THE ADVENTURE WITH BILL,
COMING UP LATER.

94
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:01,006
BILL AND HAROLD ARE GONNA WORK
ON THIS ONE.

95
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:02,975
THEY GOT A DO-IT-YOURSELF...

96
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,277
IT'S A DO-IT-YOURSELF
LOG CABIN KIT.

97
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:06,612
QUITE A BIG UNIT.

98
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,814
AND, UH... MAY NOT GO
THAT WELL,

99
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:10,783
I'M THINKING AT THIS POINT.

100
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,586
IF YOU GET INJURED
JUST OPENING THE BOX,

101
00:04:13,652 --> 00:04:16,956
THAT'S A SIGN FROM GOD
TO BUY ONE ALREADY BUILT.

102
00:04:17,022 --> 00:04:18,624
KIND OF AN UNUSUAL KIT.

103
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,259
I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING.

104
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:23,129
THE COMPANY'S INTO PACKAGING
IN A BIG WAY.

105
00:04:23,195 --> 00:04:24,630
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

106
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,765
THERE'S YOUR
DO-IT-YOURSELF KIT --

107
00:04:26,832 --> 00:04:28,634
A COUPLE OF AXES... OH, BOY.

108
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,170
A COUPLE OF AXES,
AND A COUPLE OF-- OHHH!

109
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:32,972
DON'T BE DOING THAT, HAROLD.

110
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:36,141
IF YOU'RE NOT HAVING KIDS,
MAYBE IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

111
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:39,278
OHHH! I WOULD THINK
THAT WOULD HURT,

112
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:42,448
BUT WITH HAROLD,
YOU JUST NEVER KNOW.

113
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,016
OH, I SEE -- ALL RIGHT.

114
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:47,052
THIS IS IMPORTANT
FOR YOU YOUNGSTERS WATCHING

115
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,587
WHO WANT TO DO THINGS.

116
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:52,191
YOU REALLY ARE NEVER
ANY SHARPER THAN YOUR TOOLS.

117
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:55,561
YOU CAN SEE THESE ARE TWO GUYS
IN BIG TROUBLE.

118
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,596
MAYBE THIS ONE'S ALL RIGHT.

119
00:04:57,663 --> 00:05:01,100
NO? OH, YEAH,
THAT ONE'S FINE, THAT'S FINE.

120
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,602
BILL ALWAYS QUESTIONS
EVERYTHING, DON'T YOU?

121
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:05,104
AHHH!

122
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,506
IT'S A GOOD POLICY.

123
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,575
THERE THEY ARE -- THEY'RE FINE.

124
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,610
THEY'VE GOT THE GRINDER GOING.

125
00:05:11,677 --> 00:05:13,112
OHHHH!

126
00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:15,547
WE'RE DOWN TO ONE AXE, ARE WE?

127
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:17,616
JUST DOWN TO ONE AXE NOW?

128
00:05:17,683 --> 00:05:19,718
NO, OK, HE BROUGHT 'ER BACK.

129
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:23,922
HE'S GONNA SHARPEN THAT,
'CAUSE THE OTHER ONE WAS SHARP.

130
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:27,026
WATCH OUT FOR THE SPARKS...
AND THERE'S SOME SPARKS.

131
00:05:27,092 --> 00:05:29,395
THAT COULD...
THAT'S THE KIND OF SPARKS

132
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:31,830
THAT COULD IGNITE CLOTHING.

133
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:34,199
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

134
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:35,701
OH, BY GOLLY.

135
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,369
ALL RIGHT, GET SOMETHING.

136
00:05:37,436 --> 00:05:38,871
HAROLD, GET SOMETHING.

137
00:05:38,937 --> 00:05:41,140
NEVER MIND, IT'S FINE,
WE'RE FINE.

138
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:42,574
OHHHH! OHHH!

139
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:44,076
OH, BOY.

140
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:47,679
WE'LL COME BACK ONCE WE BUY
SOME MORE INSURANCE.

141
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:51,417
OHHHH...
PIZZA IN THE KITCHEN

142
00:05:51,483 --> 00:05:53,585
PIZZA IN THE HALL

143
00:05:53,652 --> 00:05:57,256
PIZZA ON THE CARPET
AND HALFWAY UP THE WALL

144
00:05:57,322 --> 00:05:59,258
PIZZA IN THE PARLOUR

145
00:05:59,324 --> 00:06:00,926
PIZZA ON THE FLOOR

146
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:02,961
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY PIZZA

147
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:06,932
WE JUST FORGOT TO PUT THE
LID ON THE FOOD PROCESSOR

148
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,300
THIS IS THE BIG ONE!

149
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:11,570
FOR THE GRAND PRIZE
OF AN ELECTRIC HAMMER AND GLUE,

150
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,606
YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO GET MR. DALTON HUMPHREYS

151
00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:17,743
OF HUMPHREYS' EVERYTHING STORE
TO SAY THIS WORD.

152
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,279
CHARITY.

153
00:06:20,345 --> 00:06:21,613
CHARITY.

154
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,282
AND GO!

155
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:24,683
ALL RIGHT,
DALTON.

156
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,919
IN THE BIBLE, IT SAYS
THIS BEGINS AT HOME.

157
00:06:26,985 --> 00:06:28,921
ARGUMENTS.

158
00:06:28,987 --> 00:06:33,158
WHEN YOU GIVE MONEY TO A GOOD
CAUSE, YOU DONATE TO A...

159
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:34,526
... A MUTUAL
FUND.

160
00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:36,929
YOU'RE NOT EXPECTING
MONEY BACK.

161
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:38,931
IT'S A...
... SAVINGS ACCOUNT.

162
00:06:38,997 --> 00:06:41,133
OK, UNITED WAY IS A...

163
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,235
... NUISANCE!

164
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,137
WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME.

165
00:06:45,203 --> 00:06:47,406
FAMILY COMES INTO YOUR STORE.

166
00:06:47,472 --> 00:06:49,708
THEY HAVE NO MONEY, FIVE KIDS.

167
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:51,643
YOU GOT CRAPPY USED TOYS.

168
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,278
WOMAN COMES AND SAYS,

169
00:06:53,345 --> 00:06:57,015
"IF I BUY FOUR TOYS, CAN I HAVE
THE 5th TOY FOR NOTHING?"

170
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:59,584
WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M RUNNING?
A CHARITY?

171
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:01,586
(Laughing and applause)

172
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:03,155
THAT'S IT?

173
00:07:03,221 --> 00:07:06,358
THIS WEEK ON "HANDYMAN CORNER",
I WANT TO SHOW YOU

174
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,427
HOW YOU CAN DO
A VEHICLE UPGRADE

175
00:07:08,493 --> 00:07:11,697
THAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO,
BUT COULDN'T AFFORD,

176
00:07:11,763 --> 00:07:13,131
UNTIL HAROLD EXPLAINED

177
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:16,101
THAT ANYTHING ON THIS SHOW
IS A TAX WRITE-OFF.

178
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:18,937
HAROLD'S ON THE SHOW
AND HE'S A COMPLETE WRITE-OFF.

179
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:20,272
HE MUST BE RIGHT.

180
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,275
I DO A LOT OF OFF-TRACK
DRIVING IN THIS VEHICLE,

181
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:25,010
NOT NECESSARILY ON PURPOSE.

182
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:26,945
THE STEERING AND BRAKES ARE...

183
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:28,613
WELL, THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

184
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,583
UP TILL NOW, I'VE BEEN
LIKE THAT BLANCHE DUBOIS.

185
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,119
I'VE RELIED ON THE KINDNESS
OF STRANGERS.

186
00:07:34,186 --> 00:07:36,321
I WON'T HAVE TO DO THAT
ANY MORE.

187
00:07:36,388 --> 00:07:39,291
I'LL PULL MYSELF OUT OF DITCHES
FROM NOW ON.

188
00:07:39,357 --> 00:07:41,026
LOOK WHAT I GOT IN HERE!

189
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:44,062
HUH? A ONE-TON WINCH.

190
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:47,599
I JUST GOTTA HOOK THAT UP
TO THE FRONT BUMPER

191
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,569
AND BOB'S YOUR AUNT --
IT'S THE '90's.

192
00:07:50,635 --> 00:07:54,940
(Grunting)

193
00:07:56,641 --> 00:08:00,378
ALL RIGHT, NO SENSE
GETTING MY CONDITION FLARED UP.

194
00:08:00,445 --> 00:08:02,447
I'LL GET A TOOL TO HELP ME.

195
00:08:02,514 --> 00:08:04,349
THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB.

196
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,085
THAT'S WHAT I SAY
WHEN THINGS GO WRONG.

197
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:09,087
I SAY THAT A LOT.

198
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:11,089
TRY THAT UNDER THERE.

199
00:08:11,156 --> 00:08:14,593
(Grunting)

200
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:17,095
BY GOLLY, SHE'S...

201
00:08:17,162 --> 00:08:18,630
SHE'S A HEAVY UNIT.

202
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:21,600
I'LL JUST PUSH THAT OUT
WITH MY FEET.

203
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,768
ALWAYS HAD STRONG LEGS.

204
00:08:23,835 --> 00:08:25,604
REAL PROUD OF THAT.

205
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,606
ALL RIGHT, STAND BACK.

206
00:08:27,672 --> 00:08:31,109
(Grunting)

207
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:33,111
WELL, UM...

208
00:08:33,178 --> 00:08:35,614
I NEED A LEVER
OF SOME KIND TO...

209
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,082
I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

210
00:08:37,148 --> 00:08:39,884
WHY DON'T WE LET THE TOOL
DO THE WORK?

211
00:08:39,951 --> 00:08:41,386
ALL I GOTTA DO...

212
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:44,556
HOOK THE CHAIN
ONTO THE FRONT BUMPER,

213
00:08:44,623 --> 00:08:48,159
TURN ON THE WINCH
AND LET IT PULL ITSELF.

214
00:08:48,226 --> 00:08:49,961
I'LL GO HOOK 'ER UP.

215
00:08:50,028 --> 00:08:52,697
MAN, DARK DOWN HERE.

216
00:08:52,764 --> 00:08:55,567
IS THAT SHOCK ABSORBER LEAKING?

217
00:08:55,634 --> 00:08:58,103
MAYBE IT'S THE DIFFERENTIAL...
IT'S BOTH!

218
00:08:58,169 --> 00:09:00,605
I KEEP CATCHING THE PANTS
ON EVERYTHING.

219
00:09:00,672 --> 00:09:02,073
GOOD PLACE FOR A PARTY.

220
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,408
THAT RAD'S LEAKING...

221
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:05,343
SO'S THE TRANSMISSION,
THE ENGINE...

222
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,079
IT'S LIKE IT'S RAINING HERE.

223
00:09:08,146 --> 00:09:12,083
(Grunting)

224
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,586
MAN!

225
00:09:14,652 --> 00:09:16,588
OHHH...

226
00:09:16,654 --> 00:09:18,089
NOT TOO BAD.

227
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:21,126
WE JUST TAKE THIS,
HOOK 'ER ONTO THE BUMPER,

228
00:09:21,192 --> 00:09:23,561
AND THEN LET THE WINCH
PULL ITSELF.

229
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:25,263
LET THE TOOL DO THE JOB.

230
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,566
THAT'S WHAT I SAID
WHEN I MADE HAROLD PRODUCER.

231
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:32,170
ALL RIGHT, I GOT MY CHAIN
AROUND THE GRILLE

232
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:34,038
AND MAN, SHE IS SOLID.

233
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:38,109
THE GRILLE ISN'T,
BUT THE CHAIN SURE AS HECK IS.

234
00:09:38,176 --> 00:09:40,612
I'VE GOT CABLES HOOKED UP
TO TAKE ELECTRICITY

235
00:09:40,678 --> 00:09:42,013
FROM THE BATTERY

236
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,482
TO THE WINCH --
SHE'S HOOKED RIGHT--

237
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:46,017
YEAH! LOTS OF POWER.

238
00:09:46,084 --> 00:09:48,820
WE'RE ALL SET
AND I JUST FLICK 'ER ON

239
00:09:48,887 --> 00:09:50,622
AND JUST FLICK A SWITCH

240
00:09:50,688 --> 00:09:53,625
AND STAND BACK
AND LET THE WINCH DO THE WORK.

241
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:55,226
MY KIND OF PROJECT.

242
00:09:55,293 --> 00:09:56,561
HOPE I GOT

243
00:09:56,628 --> 00:09:58,696
ENOUGH POWER CABLE ON THERE.

244
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,134
THERE SHE GOES AGAIN.

245
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:05,203
MUST BE MORE THAN I THOUGHT.

246
00:10:08,706 --> 00:10:10,975
GOLLY, THAT'S NOT
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

247
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:12,644
I'LL TURN THAT WINCH OFF.

248
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,112
SHE'S WAY UP THERE NOW.

249
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:15,647
THIS IS A GOOD THING

250
00:10:15,713 --> 00:10:17,715
'CAUSE I CAN USE
THIS OPPORTUNITY

251
00:10:17,782 --> 00:10:20,118
TO CHECK THE ENTIRE
ELECTRICAL SYSTEM.

252
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:22,420
THAT LIGHT BULB'S BURNT OUT.

253
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:24,656
NEVER WOULD HAVE SEEN THAT.

254
00:10:24,722 --> 00:10:26,457
LOOK AT THOSE SPARK PLUGS.

255
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:28,092
THEY NEED TO BE GAPPED.

256
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:30,428
YEAH, BY GOLLY,
THAT NEEDS REPAIR.

257
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:32,063
THE WINCH IS
A FABULOUS THING.

258
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,666
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

259
00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:36,668
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

260
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:40,171
I SHOULD PULL
THE ENGINE OUT, TOO.

261
00:10:40,238 --> 00:10:42,507
OH, HERE IT COMES NOW.

262
00:10:42,573 --> 00:10:44,842
STAY TUNED -- WHATEVER THIS IS,

263
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:46,678
WE GOT LOTS MORE OF IT.

264
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:54,519
WANT TO TALK TO YOU GUYS
ABOUT A DISTURBING FAD.

265
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:57,488
SELF-HELP BOOKS --
YOU SEEN THESE THINGS?

266
00:10:57,555 --> 00:10:59,757
YEAH, THEY'RE IN THE BOOKSTORE.

267
00:10:59,824 --> 00:11:03,594
ODD TITLES, THINGS LIKE
"DIAPERING YOUR INNER CHILD."

268
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:05,096
(Laughing)

269
00:11:05,163 --> 00:11:08,599
"WOMEN ARE FROM VENUS,
MEN ARE IN THE BASEMENT."

270
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,636
"THE SEVEN DEVIOUS HABITS
OF SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE."

271
00:11:11,703 --> 00:11:13,137
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,

272
00:11:13,204 --> 00:11:16,574
BUT THE LAST THING I WANT
IS AN INNER CHILD FROM VENUS

273
00:11:16,641 --> 00:11:18,609
WHO'S MORE SUCCESSFUL
THAN I AM.

274
00:11:18,676 --> 00:11:22,080
WE SHOULD ALL BACK OFF
ON THE SELF-HELP THING.

275
00:11:22,146 --> 00:11:26,551
WE NEED ANOTHER KIND OF BOOK
TO HELP MEN, WITH TITLES LIKE,

276
00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:30,555
"HEY, MEN ARE PRETTY MUCH
PERFECT THE WAY THEY ARE."

277
00:11:30,621 --> 00:11:33,291
OR "EVERYTHING I NEED TO KNOW
ABOUT LIFE,

278
00:11:33,357 --> 00:11:35,560
"I LEARNED
IN THE HARDWARE STORE."

279
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:37,061
I KNOW ONE.

280
00:11:37,128 --> 00:11:40,331
"SELF-ESTEEM THROUGH
ABSENT-MINDED SCRATCHING."

281
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:42,567
THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE A MOVIE.

282
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:44,569
WE SHOULD EASE OFF
ON THE SELF-HELP

283
00:11:44,635 --> 00:11:46,270
BECAUSE IT COULD BE DANGEROUS.

284
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:48,339
YOU COULD END UP
BEING OVER-IMPROVED

285
00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:50,641
FOR THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
IN WHICH YOU LIVE,

286
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:51,976
IF YOU CATCH MY DRIFT.

287
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:54,111
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

288
00:11:54,178 --> 00:11:56,080
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

289
00:11:56,147 --> 00:11:59,083
(Applause)

290
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,385
THE PARENTS AND KIDS
AND EVERYTHING,

291
00:12:01,452 --> 00:12:04,589
THE HOCKEY PLAYERS,
THEY'RE DOWN IN THE BASEMENT,

292
00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:06,591
GETTING READY FOR THE BANQUET.

293
00:12:06,657 --> 00:12:09,160
THINGS ARE CRANKING UP
PRETTY GOOD.

294
00:12:09,227 --> 00:12:11,195
HAROLD'S ENTERTAINING THEM.

295
00:12:11,262 --> 00:12:13,564
HE'S GETTING A SING-SONG GOING.

296
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:15,099
(Harold): OWWW!
OWWW!

297
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,101
STOP THAT!

298
00:12:17,168 --> 00:12:18,603
STOP IT!

299
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:20,104
THAT'S NOT FUNNY!

300
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:23,040
SOMEONE'S GONNA GET HURT
AND THERE'S GONNA BE TROUBLE!

301
00:12:23,107 --> 00:12:25,276
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S SERIOUS!

302
00:12:25,343 --> 00:12:27,445
THAT-- OK, OK, THAT'S IT!

303
00:12:27,511 --> 00:12:29,046
HA-HA!

304
00:12:29,113 --> 00:12:31,716
NO MORE GAMES!

305
00:12:31,782 --> 00:12:34,051
(Shouting)

306
00:12:34,118 --> 00:12:36,420
ALL RIGHT,
SOMETHING'S GONNA BREAK!

307
00:12:36,487 --> 00:12:37,922
(Glass
breaking)

308
00:12:37,989 --> 00:12:39,423
(Laughing)

309
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,292
UNCLE RED! WHERE'S THE FOOD?

310
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:43,961
THEY'RE GOING CRAZY --
IT'S LIKE A RIOT!

311
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:45,997
CAN'T THE PARENTS
CONTROL THEM?

312
00:12:46,063 --> 00:12:47,932
THOSE ARE THE PARENTS!

313
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:51,302
THE KIDS ARE OUTSIDE,
PLAYING BASKETBALL!

314
00:12:51,369 --> 00:12:52,837
WE GOTTA GET FOOD!

315
00:12:52,903 --> 00:12:55,840
THEN THEY'LL PUT DOWN
THEIR WEAPONS.

316
00:12:55,906 --> 00:12:58,576
ALL RIGHT, YOU TELL 'EM
PIZZA'S ON THE WAY.

317
00:12:58,642 --> 00:13:00,077
PIZZA'S
ON THE WAY!

318
00:13:00,144 --> 00:13:01,579
YOU TELL THEM, HAROLD.

319
00:13:01,645 --> 00:13:03,080
I'M GOING
BACK IN!

320
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:04,415
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!

321
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:05,750
OHHH! OK!

322
00:13:05,816 --> 00:13:08,152
I SAW YOU! I KNOW WHO THAT IS!

323
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:10,421
I'M GONNA TELL
YOUR CHILDREN!

324
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:13,023
COME ON, COME ON...
HELLO, PIZZA SHACK?

325
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,259
THIS IS RED GREEN
AT POSSUM LODGE.

326
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:18,095
I WANT 20 LARGE PIZZAS,
EVERYTHING ON 'EM.

327
00:13:18,162 --> 00:13:19,430
YEAH, I'LL PAY CASH.

328
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:22,666
IF THEY'RE NOT HERE
IN 30 MINUTES, THEY'RE FREE?

329
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:24,101
YEAH, ALL RIGHT, BYE.

330
00:13:31,108 --> 00:13:32,543
JUNIOR, TELL THE GUYS.

331
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,247
PUT NAILS ON THE ROAD,
BURN THE VAN, BLOCK THE BRIDGE,

332
00:13:36,313 --> 00:13:39,717
SHOOT OUT THE PORCH LIGHT,
SWITCH THE STREET SIGNS.

333
00:13:39,783 --> 00:13:44,355
(Applause and cheering)

334
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:55,132
(Siren)

335
00:13:57,134 --> 00:13:58,936
POSSUM 911, CAN WE HELP YOU?

336
00:13:59,003 --> 00:14:00,271
UH, RED?

337
00:14:00,337 --> 00:14:02,072
YES, SIR!

338
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:04,108
IS THAT RED?
RIGHT HERE.

339
00:14:04,174 --> 00:14:06,010
THAT'S RED RIGHT THERE.

340
00:14:06,076 --> 00:14:07,278
THAT'S NOT RED.

341
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:09,380
I'M HAROLD -- THAT'S RED.

342
00:14:09,446 --> 00:14:11,148
WOULD YOU PUT RED ON?

343
00:14:11,215 --> 00:14:12,583
RED'S RIGHT HERE!

344
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,084
I'M HERE!

345
00:14:14,151 --> 00:14:16,086
UH, RED? IS THAT YOU?

346
00:14:16,153 --> 00:14:17,521
YEAH!

347
00:14:17,588 --> 00:14:18,856
TALK TO ME, RED!

348
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:20,190
IS THAT YOU, REALLY?

349
00:14:20,257 --> 00:14:22,092
HE'S RIGHT HERE,
IF YOU WANT TO TALK!!

350
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,360
WHO'S THAT, NOW?

351
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:24,695
THAT WAS
HAROLD.

352
00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:26,030
I'M RED -- GO AHEAD.

353
00:14:26,096 --> 00:14:27,364
THAT YOU, RED?

354
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:29,300
DID YOU SAY "FRED" OR "RED"?

355
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:32,803
RED'S HERE -- I'M HAROLD --
YOU'RE TALKING TO RED.

356
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,039
COULD YOU GET A MESSAGE TO RED?

357
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:37,107
I'LL DO MY BEST!

358
00:14:39,109 --> 00:14:41,612
UH... ARE YOU THERE, RED?

359
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:45,549
TIME TO PUT A DOOR
ON THE MICROWAVE, ALL RIGHT?

360
00:14:45,616 --> 00:14:47,785
I AM THE LEADER
OF POSSUM LODGE!

361
00:14:47,851 --> 00:14:49,920
YOU'RE ACTUALLY TALKING TO ME

362
00:14:49,987 --> 00:14:53,290
BUT IT WON'T LAST FOREVER,
IF YOU GET MY DRIFT!

363
00:14:53,357 --> 00:14:55,192
I AM THE ACTUAL RED GREEN!

364
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:56,694
RED GREEN?

365
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,195
YEAH.

366
00:14:58,262 --> 00:15:00,564
OH... HONEY, WE GOT
THE WRONG NUMBER.

367
00:15:00,631 --> 00:15:02,132
OHHHH!

368
00:15:04,134 --> 00:15:08,138
(Red): MEANWHILE,
BACK AT THE RANCH...

369
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:09,473
OHHH...

370
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,108
MUST BE DINNERTIME.

371
00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:15,079
THE BRAIN TRUST OF POSSUM LODGE
IS WORKING ON THE LOG CABIN.

372
00:15:15,145 --> 00:15:17,081
WHAT?

373
00:15:17,147 --> 00:15:18,816
BOY, THAT'S AN ODD THING.

374
00:15:18,882 --> 00:15:20,784
THAT WOULD BE A HAUNTED LOG.

375
00:15:20,851 --> 00:15:24,121
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR LOGS
TO MAKE THEIR LOG CABIN.

376
00:15:24,188 --> 00:15:26,857
THERE'S ONE --
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD ONE.

377
00:15:26,924 --> 00:15:30,093
BILL WANTS IT A CERTAIN LENGTH
AND TELLS HAROLD

378
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,029
WHERE HE WANTS-- OH, BY GOLLY!

379
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,430
(Laughing)

380
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:36,033
HEY! YOU KNOW, HERE'S A LESSON.

381
00:15:36,099 --> 00:15:38,302
IT'S A GOOD IDEA
TO BRING A PENCIL.

382
00:15:38,368 --> 00:15:39,803
THIS IS NOT-- OH, BOY!

383
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,772
THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO DO IT.

384
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,540
SO FAR, YOU'RE JUST LUCKY.

385
00:15:43,607 --> 00:15:45,542
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE LUCKY--

386
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:47,277
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

387
00:15:47,344 --> 00:15:49,546
OH, BOY... OH, BOY... OH, BOY.

388
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:51,782
OHHH! JUST CUT THE WATCH.

389
00:15:51,848 --> 00:15:53,283
(Laughing)

390
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,719
JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME,
WE CALL THAT.

391
00:15:55,786 --> 00:15:57,688
ALL RIGHT... OH, THIS IS GOOD.

392
00:15:57,754 --> 00:15:59,056
HAROLD HOLDS THE LOG.

393
00:15:59,122 --> 00:16:00,557
OK, GOOD, OK.

394
00:16:00,624 --> 00:16:02,926
THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE TO ME.

395
00:16:02,993 --> 00:16:04,428
UH... KIDS?

396
00:16:04,494 --> 00:16:07,064
DON'T TRY THIS ANYWHERE,
ALL RIGHT?

397
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,066
THERE GOES THE LOG AGAIN.

398
00:16:09,132 --> 00:16:10,767
ROLLIN', ROLLIN',
ROLLIN'

399
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:13,437
THEY'RE GONNA GO
SOMETHING HEAVIER...

400
00:16:13,503 --> 00:16:16,573
LOOKS LIKE YOU GUYS
ARE A BIT STUMPED, HUH?

401
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,342
THAT'S TOO MUCH JUICE.

402
00:16:18,408 --> 00:16:19,743
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

403
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,078
OH, BY GOSH.

404
00:16:21,144 --> 00:16:22,412
LET'S SKIP THIS PART.

405
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:23,981
DON'T BE LOOKIN' AT THAT.

406
00:16:24,047 --> 00:16:25,582
READ A BOOK FOR A SECOND.

407
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:27,017
WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

408
00:16:27,084 --> 00:16:29,119
OK, BILL'S GOT AN IDEA.

409
00:16:29,186 --> 00:16:31,521
THAT SHOULD WORK -- RIGHT.

410
00:16:31,588 --> 00:16:33,123
OH, THIS IS INTERESTING.

411
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,459
WE'RE GOING BACK
TO THE PIONEER DAYS

412
00:16:35,525 --> 00:16:37,527
BEFORE THEY EVEN HAD LIVESTOCK.

413
00:16:37,594 --> 00:16:40,630
AND THEY WOULD RUN ROPES
AROUND THINGS

414
00:16:40,697 --> 00:16:44,034
AND GET THE BIGGER WOMEN
TO PULL ON THAT.

415
00:16:44,101 --> 00:16:47,037
LOOK AT THAT -- LOOK AT THE...

416
00:16:47,104 --> 00:16:48,805
OHHH! OHHH! OHHH!

417
00:16:48,872 --> 00:16:50,140
CAREFUL, GUYS!

418
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:53,043
OK, THEY'RE GONNA--
OK, THEY FIXED 'ER UP.

419
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,546
GOT A BETTER KNOT AND
GOT 'ER WOUND ROUND MORE TIMES.

420
00:16:56,613 --> 00:16:58,115
WRAP THAT AROUND YOUR NECK.

421
00:16:58,181 --> 00:16:59,649
PULL THE SAME WAY, HAROLD.

422
00:16:59,716 --> 00:17:01,017
THE THING WITH THIS IS,

423
00:17:01,084 --> 00:17:03,653
YOU GOTTA HAVE BOTH GUYS
OF EQUAL STRENGTH.

424
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,723
I THINK MAYBE HAROLD'S
A LITTLE WEAK IN THAT AREA.

425
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,059
ACTUALLY, HAROLD'S WEAK
IN EVERY AREA.

426
00:17:09,126 --> 00:17:11,128
BILL, PULLING
AS HARD AS HE CAN,

427
00:17:11,194 --> 00:17:13,730
DOESN'T REALIZE THAT
HE'S WRAPPED HAROLD

428
00:17:13,797 --> 00:17:15,932
IN AROUND THE...
OH, BOY! OH, BOY!

429
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:19,536
YOU'VE CUT OFF HIS... YOU KNOW,
THAT THING THAT HE HAS.

430
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:22,405
YOU CUT THAT OFF --
IT'S COMPLETELY CUT OFF.

431
00:17:22,472 --> 00:17:24,741
BILL, YOU MIGHT WANT TO
GET THAT OUT.

432
00:17:24,808 --> 00:17:26,243
I DON'T THINK HE'S FAKING.

433
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:27,811
HERE'S THE THING-- OH, BOY!

434
00:17:27,878 --> 00:17:29,646
I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND-- OH, BOY!

435
00:17:29,713 --> 00:17:31,648
I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS
AS A WAY

436
00:17:31,715 --> 00:17:33,016
OF REMOVING...

437
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,351
OH, ALL RIGHT, OK.

438
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:36,820
IN THIS ONE INSTANCE,
IT WORKED FINE,

439
00:17:36,887 --> 00:17:39,022
BUT DON'T FORGET --
WE CAN EDIT.

440
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:42,859
ALL RIGHT, THEY'RE ALL SET,
AND, UH, BILL...

441
00:17:42,926 --> 00:17:44,361
(Glass
breaking)

442
00:17:44,427 --> 00:17:45,795
THE VAN WAS CLOSE BY.

443
00:17:45,862 --> 00:17:48,098
BILL HAS ANOTHER IDEA --
TWO SAWS.

444
00:17:48,164 --> 00:17:50,500
HOW ARE YOU GONNA MAKE
A LOG CABIN?

445
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:52,035
(Sawing)

446
00:17:52,102 --> 00:17:54,337
OH, FOR GOSH SAKES!

447
00:17:54,404 --> 00:17:56,706
EH? THERE'S THE KIT!

448
00:17:56,773 --> 00:17:58,041
(Laughing)

449
00:17:58,108 --> 00:17:59,709
YOU GUYS HAVE NO CHANCE.

450
00:17:59,776 --> 00:18:01,044
OH!

451
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:02,679
WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.

452
00:18:02,746 --> 00:18:06,783
LOOK AT THIS "CHAIN SAW",
SENT BY A VIEWER.

453
00:18:12,155 --> 00:18:13,757
MY FAVOURITE PART OF THE SHOW,

454
00:18:13,823 --> 00:18:16,760
WHERE WE EXAMINE THE WORDS
MEN FIND SO HARD TO SAY...

455
00:18:16,826 --> 00:18:18,762
(Audience):
"I DON'T KNOW!"

456
00:18:18,828 --> 00:18:20,096
(Laughing)

457
00:18:20,163 --> 00:18:21,431
I LOVE THAT PART.

458
00:18:21,498 --> 00:18:24,034
JOINING MY UNCLE RED
ON THE EXPERT PART

459
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,368

461
00:18:27,837 --> 00:18:29,806
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
WINSTON ROTHSCHILD.

462
00:18:29,873 --> 00:18:32,776
(Applause and cheering)

463
00:18:32,842 --> 00:18:34,344
THANK YOU.

464
00:18:36,346 --> 00:18:40,583
I'M A GOOD GUY TO KNOW WHEN
YOU CAN'T GO WITH THE FLOW.

465
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,918
(Laughing)

466
00:18:41,985 --> 00:18:43,386
CHARMING... ALL RIGHTY.

467
00:18:43,453 --> 00:18:44,988
LETTER GOES AS FOLLOWS...

468
00:18:45,055 --> 00:18:48,158
"DEAR EXPERTS, I NEVER HAD
A STRONG FASHION SENSE.

469
00:18:48,224 --> 00:18:50,794
"I DON'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND
TO SHOP WITH ME

470
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,097
"SO I'M NOT SURE HOW WIDE
A STRIPE TO GET ON A SHIRT

471
00:18:54,164 --> 00:18:57,133
"TO COMPLEMENT MY
GREEN-AND-YELLOW PLAID PANTS."

472
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,802
WAHHH!

473
00:18:58,868 --> 00:19:02,739
BOY! SAYS HE DOESN'T HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND.

474
00:19:02,806 --> 00:19:04,307
GO FIGURE, HUH?

475
00:19:04,374 --> 00:19:07,477
BUT HEY, GUY, I KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE COMIN' FROM.

476
00:19:07,544 --> 00:19:09,279
HOPEFULLY,
SOMEWHERE DARK.

477
00:19:09,345 --> 00:19:11,147
(Red): COME ON,
NOW, HAROLD.

478
00:19:11,214 --> 00:19:12,482
I'M SAYING THAT

479
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:15,652
A LOT OF MEN HATE
TO GO SHOPPING FOR CLOTHES.

480
00:19:15,718 --> 00:19:17,387
HUH! SPEAK
FOR YOURSELF,

481
00:19:17,453 --> 00:19:19,322
CAPTAIN FLANNEL.

482
00:19:19,389 --> 00:19:21,424
I JUST LOVE

483
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:24,260
SHOPPING FOR SNAPPY NEW OUTFITS
FOR MYSELF.

484
00:19:24,327 --> 00:19:27,897
SURE, I THINK OF MYSELF
AS THE CALVIN KLEIN OF SEWAGE.

485
00:19:27,964 --> 00:19:30,867
AS A GREAT MAN ONCE SAID,

486
00:19:30,934 --> 00:19:33,536
HE SAID, UH,
"YOU ARE WHAT YOU WEAR."

487
00:19:33,603 --> 00:19:35,939
I THOUGHT IT'S
"YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT".

488
00:19:36,005 --> 00:19:39,075
I SPILL STUFF ON MY SHIRT
SO THEY'RE ALL COVERED.

489
00:19:39,142 --> 00:19:40,510
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS

490
00:19:40,577 --> 00:19:43,846
HOOK IN TO WORLD-FAMOUS
SELF-HELP GURU ANTHONY ANTHONY,

491
00:19:43,913 --> 00:19:46,849
AUTHOR OF THE BOOK
"DON'T HAVE A CRAPPY LIFE".

492
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,418
(Audience laughing)

493
00:19:48,484 --> 00:19:50,353
ANTHONY ANTHONY SAYS THAT

494
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,423
WHAT WE WEAR
SAYS A LOT ABOUT OURSELVES.

495
00:19:53,489 --> 00:19:56,359
SEE, RED, YOUR OUTFIT,
IT BASICALLY SAYS,

496
00:19:56,426 --> 00:20:00,363
"I'M LAID-BACK, SLOPPY,
AND REALLY REALLY MARRIED."

497
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,864
(Laughing)

498
00:20:01,931 --> 00:20:04,734
WHEREAS HAROLD OVER HERE,
THAT JUST SCREAMS

499
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:08,805
"I'M ENERGETIC, I'M NERVOUS,
AND INEXPERIENCED WITH GIRLS."

500
00:20:08,871 --> 00:20:11,207
(Audience laughing)

501
00:20:11,274 --> 00:20:16,045
TWO VERY OPPOSITE LOOKS, TWO
VERY OPPOSITE PERSONALITIES.

502
00:20:16,112 --> 00:20:19,549
WINSTON, WE ARE WEARING
EXACTLY THE SAME UNIT, HERE.

503
00:20:19,615 --> 00:20:21,651
YOU ARE?
YEAH!
YEAH!

504
00:20:21,718 --> 00:20:24,821
BECAUSE YOU HAVE MORE
OF THE...

505
00:20:24,887 --> 00:20:26,823
NO, NO, NOT REALLY.

506
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:29,325
BUT HAROLD DOESN'T HAVE
HALF AS MUCH...

507
00:20:29,392 --> 00:20:31,794
NO, NO, IT'S THE SAME, UH...

508
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:34,597
MAYBE IT'S NOT
SO MUCH WHAT YOU WEAR.

509
00:20:34,664 --> 00:20:36,265
IT'S HOW YOU WEAR IT.

510
00:20:36,332 --> 00:20:38,334
(Laughing)

511
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:42,338
YOU PUT YOUR FOOT IN IT,
DIDN'T YOU, MR. ROTHSCHILD?

512
00:20:42,405 --> 00:20:44,340
THAT'S WHY HE HAS HIP-WADERS.

513
00:20:44,407 --> 00:20:48,678
(Laughing and applause)

514
00:20:48,745 --> 00:20:51,848
29 MINUTES AND
STILL NO PIZZA DELIVERY!

515
00:20:51,914 --> 00:20:53,850
(Shouting)

516
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,586
WE'RE 60 SECONDS AWAY
FROM A FREE BANQUET.

517
00:20:56,652 --> 00:21:00,056
I HOPE THOSE OBSTACLES
DON'T STOP THE GUY COMPLETELY.

518
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:01,858
IF THOSE PIZZAS ARE LATE...

519
00:21:01,924 --> 00:21:05,294
THOSE HOCKEY PARENTS
WILL LEVEL THIS PLACE.

520
00:21:05,361 --> 00:21:06,796
30 SECONDS TO GO!

521
00:21:06,863 --> 00:21:08,297
(Car door closing)

522
00:21:08,364 --> 00:21:09,799
PIZZA'S HERE!

523
00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:11,300
WHAT?!

524
00:21:11,367 --> 00:21:12,802
OH, NO!!!

525
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:14,136
YEAH, WHAT?

526
00:21:14,203 --> 00:21:15,771
YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS.

527
00:21:15,838 --> 00:21:17,840
AFTER YOU ORDERED, I WENT OUT

528
00:21:17,907 --> 00:21:20,276
TO MAKE SURE
THE PORCH LIGHT WAS ON

529
00:21:20,343 --> 00:21:21,878
SO HE COULD FIND US.

530
00:21:21,944 --> 00:21:23,312
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHAT?

531
00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:24,814
IT WAS SHOT OUT!

532
00:21:24,881 --> 00:21:26,315
OHHH, HAROLD!

533
00:21:26,382 --> 00:21:29,151
IT WAS WEIRD, 'CAUSE
WHEN I TURNED IT ON,

534
00:21:29,218 --> 00:21:32,288
I SAW SMOKE COMING
FROM MERCURY CREEK BRIDGE.

535
00:21:32,355 --> 00:21:33,623
KNOW WHAT I SAW?

536
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:35,324
(Together): A VAN ON FIRE!

537
00:21:35,391 --> 00:21:36,826
YEAH, JUST ON FIRE!

538
00:21:36,893 --> 00:21:39,862
I TOLD THE PIZZA GUY
TO TAKE THE SHORT WAY.

539
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:41,631
WHAT SHORT WAY?

540
00:21:41,697 --> 00:21:43,366
ACROSS THE LAKE IN A BOAT.

541
00:21:43,432 --> 00:21:44,867
OHHHH,
MY GOSH!

542
00:21:44,934 --> 00:21:48,838
LUCKY I SAW FLAMES --
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN HOUR.

543
00:21:48,904 --> 00:21:50,339
GOSH, THAT
WAS LUCKY!

544
00:21:50,406 --> 00:21:51,974
HERE'S THE BILL.

545
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,844
THERE'S THE BILL
RIGHT THERE -- $315.75.

546
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,312
OH, MY...

547
00:21:56,379 --> 00:21:59,348
I'LL TAKE THESE DOWN,
IF YOU'LL PAY HIM.

548
00:21:59,415 --> 00:22:01,350
ALL RIGHT, HAROLD.

549
00:22:01,417 --> 00:22:04,286
HAROLD, YOU KNOW,
YOU ARE AN M.V.P.

550
00:22:04,353 --> 00:22:06,789
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

551
00:22:06,856 --> 00:22:08,791
DON'T FORGET TO TIP HIM.

552
00:22:08,858 --> 00:22:10,292
(Audience laughing)

553
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:12,862
I'M COMING! I'M COMING, YOU...!

554
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:18,734
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

555
00:22:18,801 --> 00:22:21,303
I'M NOT GONNA BE
COMING HOME FOR A WHILE.

556
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,139
I'M GOING TO THE PIZZA SHACK.

557
00:22:23,205 --> 00:22:26,308
I'LL BE WASHING PANS
FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME.

558
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,744
PROBABLY BE PAINTING THE PLACE

559
00:22:28,811 --> 00:22:30,813
AND TUNING UP
THEIR DELIVERY TRUCKS.

560
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,314
(Crying)

561
00:22:32,381 --> 00:22:34,450
I'M NOT REALLY HUNGRY
ANYWAY, SO...

562
00:22:34,517 --> 00:22:36,819
EVERYBODY ELSE...

563
00:22:36,886 --> 00:22:38,320
SEE YA.

564
00:22:38,387 --> 00:22:39,822
(Laughing and applause)

565
00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:41,824
(Possum squeal)

566
00:22:41,891 --> 00:22:43,826
EVERYBODY WANT PIZZA?

567
00:22:43,893 --> 00:22:54,336
(Shouting)

568
00:22:54,403 --> 00:22:56,338
THERE'S SOME OVER THERE!

569
00:22:56,405 --> 00:22:58,841
THERE'S PEPPERONI HERE!

570
00:22:58,908 --> 00:23:00,543
THE DOUBLE-CHEESE IS--

571
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:02,678
NO, DOUBLE-CHEESE IS THERE!

572
00:23:02,745 --> 00:23:05,214
NOW, SOMEBODY WANTED
NO-ANCHOVIES!

573
00:23:05,281 --> 00:23:06,615
NO-ANCHOVIES IS...

574
00:23:06,682 --> 00:23:08,284
THIS IS NO-ANCHOVIES.

575
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,352
THAT'S NO-PIZZA, REALLY.

576
00:23:12,354 --> 00:23:15,424
YOU KNOW, THERE'S HIGH FIBRE
IN THE BOX!

577
00:23:15,491 --> 00:23:17,159
DON'T NEGATE THE BOX!
