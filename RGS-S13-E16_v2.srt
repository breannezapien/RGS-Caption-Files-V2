WELL, THAT'S
NOT THAT EASY.

154
00:07:52,871 --> 00:07:55,740
YOU GET A BUNCH OF LODGE
MEMBERS IN THE KITCHEN
COOKING DINNER,

155
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,076
NOW YOU GOT THAT ELEMENT OF
GENDER AMBIGUITY

156
00:07:58,076 --> 00:08:02,347
THAT MAKES A LOT OF US NERVOUS
ABOUT SLEEPING IN A
FOUR-MAN TENT.

157
00:08:02,347 --> 00:08:06,151
SO IT'S BETTER IF COOK OUR
PIZZA IN A NON-KITCHEN
ENVIRONMENT.

158
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:08,053
RIGHT NOW ON HANDYMAN CORNER

159
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:09,788
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU
HOW TO DO EXACTLY THAT,

160
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:12,023
USING SOMETHING YOU ALREADY
GOT LYING AROUND YOUR HOUSE...

161
00:08:12,023 --> 00:08:13,825
I DON'T MEAN
YOUR GRANDFATHER.

162
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:16,495
I'M TALKING ABOUT ONE
OF THESE OLD RECORD PLAYERS.

163
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:19,598
[ COUGHING ]

164
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,968
ONE OF THESE OLDER MODELS
WITH THE LONG SPINDLES

165
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:24,569
FOR STACKING RECORDS ON.

166
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:27,706
NEXT YOU NEED AN ALBUM
TO COOK THE PIZZA ON THAT,

167
00:08:27,706 --> 00:08:30,709
PREFERABLY SOMETHING THAT'S
USED TO LOTS OF CHEESE.

168
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:34,145
THAT'S WHY I WENT
WITH WILLIAM SHATNER.

169
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:36,181
OKAY, ONCE YOU
GET THAT ON THERE,

170
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:38,617
ALL'S YOU DO IS TAKE
A POUND OF PIZZA DOUGH,

171
00:08:38,617 --> 00:08:41,653
STICK THAT RIGHT DOWN
OVER THE SPINDLE.

172
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:43,221
AND YOU'RE SET TO ROLL.

173
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:44,823
NOW, THE BEAUTY
OF THESE OLD MACHINES,

174
00:08:44,823 --> 00:08:46,291
YOU GET THE
78 SPEED ON THERE.

175
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,361
THAT WAY YOU CAN GET CAPTAIN
KIRK DOIN' WARP SPEED.

176
00:08:54,265 --> 00:08:57,369
MAY THE CENTRIFUGAL
FORCE BE WITH YOU.

177
00:09:04,142 --> 00:09:06,277
OKAY, NEXT WE USE
THE SAME BASIC PRINCIPLE

178
00:09:06,277 --> 00:09:08,947
TO ADD OUR TOMATO SAUCE
AND OUR PEPPERONI.

179
00:09:08,947 --> 00:09:11,149
I'VE ACTUALLY PRE-LOADED
THE TOMATO SAUCE

180
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:13,651
INTO THIS SQUEEZABLE
KETCHUP BOTTLE HERE.

181
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:21,559
OKAY, NOW, FOR
OUR PEPPERONI,

182
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,495
JUST TAKE ONE OF THESE
PEPPERONI STICKS

183
00:09:23,495 --> 00:09:25,230
AND DROP IT DOWN
AN OLD CIGAR TUBE.

184
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,898
NOW ALL WE HAVE
TO DO IS SLICE IT.

185
00:09:26,898 --> 00:09:30,235
THAT'S WHY I'VE GOT A CIGAR
CUTTER MOUNTED ON THE
BOTTOM END.

186
00:09:36,274 --> 00:09:38,476
OKAY, NOW HERE
COMES THE BEST PART.

187
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:40,812
SEE, I'VE TAKEN
THIS AEROSOL CHEESE HERE

188
00:09:40,812 --> 00:09:43,548
AND I'VE GOT HER HOOKED UP
TO THIS FEEDER TUBE.

189
00:09:45,283 --> 00:09:48,052
NOW I JUST ATTACH THAT TO THE
UNDERSIDE OF MY TONE ARM HERE,

190
00:09:48,052 --> 00:09:49,921
WHERE MY RECORD
NEEDLE USED TO BE.

191
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:52,824
AND THEN I JUST SET
IT DOWN TO 45 rpm

192
00:09:52,824 --> 00:09:55,426
AND LET THE CHEESE
PLAY THE PIZZA.

193
00:09:55,426 --> 00:09:58,396
IF YOU LIKE DOUBLE CHEESE,
JUST SET HER ON 33 1/3.

194
00:10:08,206 --> 00:10:10,441
OKAY, WE'RE ALMOST
DONE HERE.

195
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:12,544
NOW TO TURN THIS
BABY INTO AN OVEN,

196
00:10:12,544 --> 00:10:14,479
JUST DUCT TAPE
SOME OLD TOASTER ELEMENTS

197
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:17,549
TO THE UNDERSIDE
OF THE DUST COVER.

198
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:20,785
BUT IF YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE
PEOPLE WHO LIKES YOUR
CRUST EXTRA CRISPY,

199
00:10:20,785 --> 00:10:23,588
MAYBE YOU WANNA
GO WITH A CD BURNER.

200
00:10:33,164 --> 00:10:35,733
OH, THERE'S A
SUREFIRE HIT.

201
00:10:35,733 --> 00:10:37,368
AND ONCE WE SLICE IT,

202
00:10:37,368 --> 00:10:38,903
WE'LL HAVE
A HIT SINGLE.

203
00:10:38,903 --> 00:10:41,806
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

204
00:10:41,806 --> 00:10:45,843
THEY SHOULD AT
LEAST FIND YOU... HANDY.

205
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:50,782
WE HAVEN'T JUST
MADE A GREAT PIZZA,

206
00:10:50,782 --> 00:10:53,584
WE'VE SET A RECORD.

207
00:11:04,062 --> 00:11:06,097
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A
PERIOD IN A MAN'S LIFE

208
00:11:06,097 --> 00:11:08,299
WHEN HIS BODY
IS A DICTATORSHIP.

209
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:10,768
HIS BRAIN IS
THE GREAT DICTATOR,

210
00:11:10,768 --> 00:11:13,271
SNAPPING OFF ORDERS
AND RULING HIS BODY

211
00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:14,839
WITH AN IRON FIST.

212
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:17,108
OH, SURE, THERE ARE
OCCASIONAL UPRISINGS,

213
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:19,644
BUT THEY DON'T LAST LONG.

214
00:11:19,644 --> 00:11:21,546
GENERALLY THE BODY DOES

215
00:11:21,546 --> 00:11:23,448
WHATEVER THE BRAIN
TELLS IT TO DO.

216
00:11:23,448 --> 00:11:25,650
BUT THEN,
AS IN HISTORY,

217
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,718
THE LOYAL SUBJECTS
EVENTUALLY REALISE

218
00:11:27,718 --> 00:11:30,555
THEIR LEADER
DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE.

219
00:11:30,555 --> 00:11:33,224
AND THAT BRINGS THE
GREAT BODY REBELLION --

220
00:11:33,224 --> 00:11:34,892
OR AS IT'S ALSO KNOWN,

221
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:36,794
MIDDLE AGE.

222
00:11:36,794 --> 00:11:39,030
I MEAN, IT MIGHT
BEGIN SLOW.

223
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,966
MAYBE YOUR STOMACH STARTS
REFUSING DELIVERY

224
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:45,069
ON THOSE MIDNIGHT
PEPPERONI PIZZAS.

225
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:49,540
MAYBE YOUR KNEES DON'T WANT
TO GO UPSTAIRS JUST NOW.

226
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,577
MAYBE YOUR LIBIDO IS
MOUNTING AN INITIATIVE,

227
00:11:52,577 --> 00:11:56,414
BUT CAN'T FIND
ANY VOLUNTEERS.

228
00:11:56,414 --> 00:11:58,950
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE
A NEW CONSTITUTION.

229
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,185
YOU'RE NOT A
DICTATORSHIP ANYMORE;

230
00:12:01,185 --> 00:12:03,421
YOU'RE A WIDE OPEN
DEMOCRACY,

231
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:07,291
WHERE EVERY MUSCLE, ORGAN,
BONE AND SINEW GETS A VOTE.

232
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:11,028
NOT ONLY IS YOUR BRAIN
NO LONGER DICTATOR FOR LIFE,

233
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:12,997
BUT IN A FEW YEARS,

234
00:12:12,997 --> 00:12:15,933
YOUR BODY PARTS WON'T EVEN
BE ABLE TO AGREE ON ANYTHING.

235
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:17,635
YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT LEADS TO...

236
00:12:17,635 --> 00:12:19,337
BAD GOVERNMENT,
VOTER UNREST

237
00:12:19,337 --> 00:12:21,172
AND SADDEST OF ALL,

238
00:12:21,172 --> 00:12:24,342
A HANGING CHAD.

239
00:12:24,342 --> 00:12:26,677
REMEMBER
I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

240
00:12:26,677 --> 00:12:29,013
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

241
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:40,691
HAROLD?
HAROLD!

242
00:12:41,692 --> 00:12:43,194
UNCLE RED!

243
00:12:43,194 --> 00:12:44,895
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

244
00:12:44,895 --> 00:12:46,197
YOU'RE NOT
GONNA JUMP, ARE YOU?

245
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:49,100
NO!
HERE, HELP ME UP.

246
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:53,270
OOH, SOFT HANDS.
YOU USE MOISTURIZER?

247
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:57,108
THAT'S JUST WEIRD.
YOU COME IN HERE.
YOU COME IN HERE.

248
00:12:57,108 --> 00:12:59,276
STOP FOOLIN'
AROUND LIKE THAT.

249
00:12:59,276 --> 00:13:00,711
YOU'RE GONNA GO CRAZY.

250
00:13:00,711 --> 00:13:03,214
I'M FINE, REALLY.
IT'S JUST --

251
00:13:03,214 --> 00:13:05,182
BUT YOU WORRY ABOUT ME?

252
00:13:05,182 --> 00:13:06,817
WELL, HAROLD,
I COME UP HERE,

253
00:13:06,817 --> 00:13:08,386
YOU'RE HANGING OFF
THE SIDE OF THE TOWER.

254
00:13:08,386 --> 00:13:10,788
NO, I'M JUST ADJUSTING
THE TELEVISION ANTENNA.

255
00:13:10,788 --> 00:13:12,490
THIS IS THE HIGHEST
POINT IN THE AREA.

256
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,925
I CAN GET LIKE 78 CHANNELS.

257
00:13:14,925 --> 00:13:16,627
WELL, YOU KNOW, HAROLD,
TELEVISION IS NOT --

258
00:13:16,627 --> 00:13:18,062
78 CHANNELS?

259
00:13:18,062 --> 00:13:19,964
YEAH, 78.

260
00:13:19,964 --> 00:13:22,933
BUT HAROLD, DON'T YOU MISS,
LIKE, HUMAN CONVERSATION,

261
00:13:22,933 --> 00:13:24,635
SOMEONE TO TALK TO?

262
00:13:24,635 --> 00:13:27,838
UM, NO, I'M PRETTY
COMFORTABLE.

263
00:13:27,838 --> 00:13:29,640
I MEAN, THERE'S PLENTY
OF BOOKS TO READ

264
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,875
AND LOTS OF
FOOD TO EAT.

265
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,576
RANGER GORD SAID I COULD
HAVE ANYTHING I WANT --

266
00:13:32,576 --> 00:13:34,478
EXCEPT THE
CANNED BEANS.

267
00:13:34,478 --> 00:13:38,749
HE SAYS HE USES THEM
AS HIS ALARM CLOCK.

268
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:42,119
YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S NOT
NORMAL, HAROLD, OKAY.

269
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:43,754
I DON'T WANT YOU TURNING
OUT LIKE THAT, OKAY?

270
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:45,756
I'M JUST FINE.
I REALLY AM.

271
00:13:45,756 --> 00:13:47,458
BUT IF YOU MISS
ME THAT BAD,

272
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,193
YOU KNOW, YOU WANT
ME BACK THERE,

273
00:13:49,193 --> 00:13:51,262
YOU NEED ME BACK THERE,
I AM THERE.

274
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:58,102
WELL, YOU KNOW -- I'M JUST
SAYING THAT YOU'RE UP HERE
IN THE TOWER, OKAY,

275
00:13:58,102 --> 00:13:59,637
AND YOU CAN START
LOSING IT, YOU KNOW.

276
00:13:59,637 --> 00:14:02,106
LIKE, YOU COULD
FORGET WHAT DAY IT IS.

277
00:14:02,106 --> 00:14:04,341
WHAT DAY IS IT?

278
00:14:04,341 --> 00:14:06,010
IT'S SUNDAY.

279
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,212
NO, IT ISN'T.
IT'S FRIDAY.

280
00:14:08,212 --> 00:14:10,281
OKAY, THAT WAS A BAD EXAMPLE.
I THINK SO.

281
00:14:10,281 --> 00:14:12,016
OKAY, WHAT I'M SAYING IS

282
00:14:12,016 --> 00:14:15,019
YOUR SANITY'S UP FOR GRABS
IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS.

283
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:16,754
WELL, I APPRECIATE
YOUR CONCERN,
I REALLY DO,

284
00:14:16,754 --> 00:14:19,256
BUT UNCLE RED,
I AM JUST FINE.

285
00:14:19,256 --> 00:14:21,258
ALL RIGHT.

286
00:14:21,258 --> 00:14:23,093
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

287
00:14:23,093 --> 00:14:25,396
OKAY, THAT'S ALL
I NEEDED TO HEAR.

288
00:14:25,396 --> 00:14:27,931
OKAY, AWAY YOU GO.

289
00:14:27,931 --> 00:14:30,067
NO, I STAY HERE.
YOU GO BACK DOWN
TO THE LODGE.

290
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:31,902
YEAH, OKAY. YEAH.

291
00:14:31,902 --> 00:14:33,404
HAROLD, LOOK,
PROMISE ME THIS,

292
00:14:33,404 --> 00:14:34,872
IF YOU FIND YOURSELF
GOIN' BONKERS,

293
00:14:34,872 --> 00:14:36,240
YOU JUST COME ON HOME.
OKAY.

294
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,609
OKAY, GREAT.
OKAY.

295
00:14:38,609 --> 00:14:40,844
UNCLE RED, YOU MIGHT
WANNA TAKE THE STAIRS.

296
00:14:40,844 --> 00:14:43,380
YEAH.

297
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,383
[ APPLAUSE ]

298
00:14:47,851 --> 00:14:51,155
Red:
I WAS TRYING TO RECAPTURE MY
YOUTH A LITTLE BIT LAST WEEK.

299
00:14:51,155 --> 00:14:52,656
DECIDED TO TAKE
A FOOTBALL OUT.

300
00:14:52,656 --> 00:14:54,024
IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR.

301
00:14:54,024 --> 00:14:55,559
JUST TOSS THE FOOTBALL
AROUND THE FIELD,

302
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:57,094
SO I FIRE ONE OVER
TOWARDS WALTER.

303
00:14:57,094 --> 00:14:58,962
NEVER FLINCHED, YOU KNOW.

304

FROM THE FIRE TOWER,

458
00:21:27,884 --> 00:21:30,753
AND HE HASN'T
CHANGED A BIT.

459
00:21:30,753 --> 00:21:34,323
ACTUALLY, I CAN'T
REMEMBER THE GOOD NEWS.
