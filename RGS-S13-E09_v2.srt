1
00:00:01,534 --> 00:00:05,705
Seems like everywhere you go lately, you see
more and more of these bobblehead dolls.

2
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:10,009
Oh sure, it was fine with hockey players,
baseball players and important guys like

3
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:13,747
that. But now that everybody's trying to
make a quick buck, this thing has really

4
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:14,814
gotten out of control.

5
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:20,720
On the other hand, they do make a nice gift.

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,394
Of course, like any good, handy man, I like
to take existing ideas and make them bigger,

7
00:00:28,394 --> 00:00:30,730
better and potentially more disturbing.

8
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:36,035
A lot of people don't carry these mannequins
around in their car to discourage stalkers.

9
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,037
Also lets them use the carpool lane.

10
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:44,777
But I'm thinking we can make this unit a lot
more lifelike by using an old car spring to

11
00:00:44,777 --> 00:00:47,247
turn this baby into a full size bobblehead.

12
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,986
Let's hope nobody just tuned in.

13
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,459
I'm a pretty good driver, and I.

14
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:20,914
It. Big, big week up at the lines this week.

15
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:22,682
This is our annual softball tournament.

16
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:24,050
We got a pretty good team this year.

17
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,319
Mr. Hatfield is shortstop.

18
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,187
Mose Thompson his wide stop.

19
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:31,424
And old man Sedgwick is third base.

20
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,594
He's not playing third base, he is.

21
00:01:36,562 --> 00:01:37,697
Well, we got a problem.

22
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,633
Just a minute, Harold, grab grab the bat
there, will you just about everything right

23
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:41,634
there on the game? Yeah, yeah.

24
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,469
Ok, now think fast. Come on.

25
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:47,206
Come on. Go for it. Wow!

26
00:01:47,473 --> 00:01:50,410
A digger. Oh, yeah.

27
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,345
Baseball is not my sport.

28
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,847
No, no. I would imagine that you're not.

29
00:01:54,847 --> 00:01:56,649
My sport list is pretty extensive, Harold.

30
00:01:58,184 --> 00:01:59,252
I'm not sports oriented.

31
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,921
I'm not sports oriented. No, no, no, no, no.

32
00:02:02,588 --> 00:02:04,457
Those who can do those who can't.

33
00:02:06,325 --> 00:02:09,295
Yeah. You know, our problem is they'll
hardly any guy in the team can afford the

34
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,530
twenty dollars entry fee.

35
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,733
Oh, I know that that's because the government
cut off all their unemployment checks.

36
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,002
They do that if you don't have any work for
a while.

37
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:20,072
The only way to keep getting paid for doing
nothing ever is to actually work for the

38
00:02:20,072 --> 00:02:20,640
government.

39
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:26,746
Well, it's a shame that the team won't have
any representation in the tournament this

40
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:28,648
year. Is there anything I can do?

41
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:34,854
Not usually. We'll see, you know, me, do the
guys could find work even for a week?

42
00:02:34,887 --> 00:02:37,190
See that would that would trigger their poky
to start up again?

43
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,959
Oh, I heard down in the amusement park,
they're hiring people to hose off the world

44
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:40,526
and hurl.

45
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:46,499
Now, we don't need real jobs, we just we just
need fake jobs you don't like.

46
00:02:46,732 --> 00:02:49,936
One guy could get a second guy to do
something, you know, and then pretend to pay

47
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,405
him. And then the third guy could work for
the second guy and then the fourth guy for

48
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:55,875
the third guy. And then eventually the money
would come all the way around, you know?

49
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,582
Ok, but what does that money come from?

50
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:05,151
Well, that's a great idea, you can lend it to
us.

51
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:08,888
Yeah. You just asked me for anything you
could do.

52
00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:10,256
And you get the money back.

53
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:10,756
I will.

54
00:03:10,756 --> 00:03:11,958
Yeah, yeah, OK.

55
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,160
Well, all right. If you say so, then OK.

56
00:03:14,393 --> 00:03:15,461
All right. You know what, though?

57
00:03:15,661 --> 00:03:16,696
I just don't see it.

58
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:17,930
Well, Harold Harold,

59
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,632
You know, of course you don't see it.

60
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:21,500
You're an umpire, huh?

61
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:30,676
It's time for the

62
00:03:30,676 --> 00:03:32,611
Possum Lodge word game.

63
00:03:39,585 --> 00:03:46,092
Today's prize is this coupon for a shampoo
and hairstyle from the exclusive hair salon

64
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:48,594
Fabio of Port Asbestos.

65
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:51,897
If you're bald, he'll do your dog.

66
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,136
Ok. Cover your ears, Dalton Red, you've got
30 seconds to get Dalton to say this word

67
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,940
infatuation in at you.

68
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,775
All right. And go.

69
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:06,746
All right, Dalton, you see a guy who's got a
glazed look on his face.

70
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,080
He's been a victim of this.

71
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,385
Too many donuts. No, OK, no, no, no, this is
like an obsession.

72
00:04:13,452 --> 00:04:16,555
Something about a person that means you
can't stop thinking about them.

73
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:17,656
They owe me money.

74
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:22,294
Ok, no, no. This is something that really
holds your interest, a bank.

75
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,764
Now don't get off that, OK, this is
personal, OK?

76
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:28,000
Like something really special about a girl?

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,304
I mean, she may not be the most beautiful
woman in the world, but you know she can

78
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:34,240
afford to pay for dinner.

79
00:04:36,475 --> 00:04:38,010
I read you're almost out of time.

80
00:04:38,377 --> 00:04:41,380
Ok, Don, remember back in high school,
Bernice broke up with me.

81
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:43,649
I was real sad. I put on about 40 pounds.

82
00:04:43,782 --> 00:04:45,784
That's because she had this power over me.

83
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:49,188
Power, come on. And that's because of all the
salt and fat you ate.

84
00:04:49,521 --> 00:04:59,331
There we. That's the

85
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:01,834
repair shop, part of the show we call, if it
ain't broke.

86
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:08,474
You're not trying. Joining me today is local
demolitions expert and explosives enthusiast

87
00:05:08,707 --> 00:05:10,709
Edgar Montrose. What do you got for us
today, Edgar?

88
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,178
Oh, never on an empty stomach red.

89
00:05:15,147 --> 00:05:16,548
That's not why I'm here.

90
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:20,686
I'm having trouble getting these jars open.

91
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:23,288
Yeah, give it a try.

92
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,926
Why do you want the lids off anyway?

93
00:05:28,927 --> 00:05:34,266
Well, I got a hot date tonight and I think
one of these jars definitely has mouthwash in

94
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:34,466
it.

95
00:05:36,702 --> 00:05:37,503
What's on the other one?

96
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:44,810
Nitroglycerin. Well, quick jumping around
read, You're making me nervous.

97
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:47,880
I still need the mouthwash.

98
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:52,451
Ten minutes. Yeah. You wrap your hands around
the jar.

99
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:54,052
Ok, hold a real solid OK.

100
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:57,823
Yeah. Might help if that finger wasn't
missing or

101
00:05:58,457 --> 00:05:59,458
It's not missing, right?

102
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,893
I know exactly where it is.

103
00:06:03,328 --> 00:06:06,198
It's up at the quarry, still pointing at the
no smoking sign.

104
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:10,068
Ok, there you go, check that

105
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,006
Huey P. Huey, that's the

106
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,307
Nitro. All right, all right.

107
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:17,476
No, no. Put her down towards the edge.

108
00:06:17,576 --> 00:06:18,710
Not too close to the edge.

109
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:21,246
We're down over there. Hey, that's good.

110
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,414
Ok, all right. Good.

111
00:06:22,414 --> 00:06:24,950
And I'll just pop this one open for, you
know, it should be good.

112
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,619
There you go. Everybody can breathe easier
now.

113
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:29,087
Oh, good. Good.

114
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:34,793
Bottoms up. Yeah. Good idea.

115
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:38,330
What?

116
00:06:44,202 --> 00:06:45,938
Well, I guess they're both natural.

117
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:50,542
Well, Edgar, you better cancel that date.

118
00:06:50,742 --> 00:06:51,910
Oh, no.

119
00:06:51,977 --> 00:06:55,881
Women like hot men, red, where's that red hot
men?

120
00:06:58,383 --> 00:06:59,818
Wait till she sees this.

121
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:10,729
You know, when you look back over the history
of man since the beginning of time, you see

122
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:14,900
an evolution from a pathetic creature who
spent most of his time on all fours,

123
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:20,372
sometimes called the husband to a Homo
erectus, which is Latin, but still scares me.

124
00:07:20,972 --> 00:07:25,544
And finally, to the ultimate stage of a
middle aged man's development full recline.

125
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:31,983
This is the perfect position for a man to
watch television or read the newspaper or

126
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:34,419
receive his behavior modification therapy.

127
00:07:39,925 --> 00:07:43,729
It's well known we've all heard of the
recline of the American empire.

128
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:50,535
While a full recline is the perfect position
for the middle aged man, doesn't it make

129
00:07:50,535 --> 00:07:54,840
sense to allow him to be in that position as
often as possible, not just for things he

130
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,210
does once a year? I go to church hard at
work.

131
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,883
I'm talking about reclining on a daily
basis, like when you're driving your car.

132
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:11,156
I can reach the pedals from the prone
position, so I didn't need to do anything

133
00:08:11,156 --> 00:08:14,693
about those, but I figure I may need to
steer at some point.

134
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:21,833
So I took the drive assembly off this ten
speed bike, added some chain to her and made

135
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,602
myself a remote steering wheel.

136
00:08:24,636 --> 00:08:28,874
Thanks to the simple technology of chain and
sprockets, I can now drive flat out.

137
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:34,880
Big wheel, keep on turning rubber just keeps
on burning.

138
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:40,151
And if my arms get tired from driving
straight legs, say, going across the Scotch

139
00:08:40,151 --> 00:08:42,654
one, I just put her in cruise control.

140
00:08:45,624 --> 00:08:49,961
Now, of course, seeing where you're going is
almost as important as being comfortable, so

141
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:51,630
I need to look up through the roof.

142
00:08:52,864 --> 00:08:56,601
It would be helpful if this car had a
sunroof, but I'm not going to complain about

143
00:08:56,601 --> 00:09:00,105
that when I look around at all the riches
that I do have.

144
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,081
Ok, thanks, thanks very much.

145
00:09:12,017 --> 00:09:13,184
Yeah, I got a tip for you.

146
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:16,354
You know, there's some type of foam
insulation in the roof of a car and it's very

147
00:09:16,354 --> 00:09:18,189
flammable. A lot of you may not know that.

148
00:09:21,893 --> 00:09:26,331
Ok, amount and a full length mirror at just
the right angle so that I'll be able to see

149
00:09:26,331 --> 00:09:30,802
the road while I'm laying down this mirror
is actually mounted on our back door, so I

150
00:09:30,802 --> 00:09:34,339
just took the whole thing. Of course, now
with no bathroom there, that means we can't

151
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:36,341
have company. So it's a win win.

152
00:09:39,344 --> 00:09:42,881
Some of you probably already realize that
that mirror is going to make things look

153
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:44,249
upside down to me.

154
00:09:44,382 --> 00:09:46,684
It's the same thing that happens with
binocular lenses.

155
00:09:46,718 --> 00:09:50,889
So what I did was I took the lenses out of
this made myself a pair of glasses that'll

156
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:52,524
make the reflection right side up.

157
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:55,827
I'm a lot smarter than I look.

158
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:04,802
Ok, don't don't put the glasses on until
you're actually driving the car.

159
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,741
Get a real bad headache. That's our if the
women don't find you handsome, they should at

160
00:10:09,741 --> 00:10:15,847
least find your handy, OK, time to prove
that a lazy boy is not just a chair, it's a

161
00:10:15,847 --> 00:10:16,614
way of life.

162
00:10:45,443 --> 00:10:52,216
I read in the paper that more and more men
are taking off all of their body hair with

163
00:10:52,283 --> 00:10:54,952
razors, lasers and, yes, even duct tape.

164
00:10:57,522 --> 00:11:01,326
Let me just say this about that, our.

165
00:11:03,628 --> 00:11:07,699
And apparently, some guys are even having
the bikini waxing so they can wear a thong.

166
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:15,807
Please don't do that. No guy looks good in a
thong.

167
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:23,047
Where one and especially don't shave to do
it, then God gave you body hair to hide the

168
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:26,951
ugly parts. It's really his way of saying
yikes.

169
00:11:29,153 --> 00:11:30,955
So don't go against that whole thing.

170
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:33,224
Keep the body here and go one step further.

171
00:11:33,257 --> 00:11:34,826
Wear clothes, lots of clothes.

172
00:11:35,893 --> 00:11:38,563
The more close you have on, the more
attractive you are.

173
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,833
That's actually true with ninety nine
percent of people.

174
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,969
That's why the birth rate is so low at
nudist camps.

175
00:11:46,537 --> 00:11:47,605
Don't take my word for it.

176
00:11:47,672 --> 00:11:49,273
Go ahead. Ask your wife, she'll tell you.

177
00:11:49,774 --> 00:11:53,277
Do you want you to wear as many clothes as
possible as often as possible?

178
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:55,947
And the only thing she wants you to shave is
your face.

179
00:11:56,781 --> 00:11:59,550
And it's not just because she's the one who
has to clean out the bathtub.

180
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:02,053
Remember, I'm pulling for you.

181
00:12:02,553 --> 00:12:03,688
We're all in this together.

182
00:12:07,658 --> 00:12:09,660
If you eat something, set it free.

183
00:12:10,027 --> 00:12:11,495
If it comes back to you.

184
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:12,396
Call me.

185
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,237
Our fake work make work project is going
great.

186
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,741
Mike just has to pay me for pretending to
stack is firewood, and we're done.

187
00:12:24,675 --> 00:12:28,646
See, I got the two hundred bucks from
Harold, and then I hired Junior Single to

188
00:12:28,646 --> 00:12:31,582
give me stock market investment advice,
which was don't.

189
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:36,654
And then he hired Stinky to do a little feng
shui around his outhouse.

190
00:12:38,489 --> 00:12:42,093
And then Stinky hired Buster to pretend to
be a male escort.

191
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:45,930
And then Buster paid Mike not to rob him.

192
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:48,599
Read.

193
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,534
Yeah, I need that two hundred dollars back
now.

194
00:12:50,935 --> 00:12:53,871
Well, no, no, no, not not yet, Harold,
because actually when I get that money, we

195
00:12:53,871 --> 00:12:56,574
need that to pay our entrance fee into the
softball tournament.

196
00:12:56,974 --> 00:12:58,409
Ok, but when do I get my money?

197
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,778
Wallace, you know, it's going.

198
00:13:00,778 --> 00:13:03,514
It's going to be a while because the guys
are all going down to the government office

199
00:13:03,514 --> 00:13:06,650
this afternoon. They're going to report
their recent employment, and that's going to

200
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,452
trigger the benefits to start up again.

201
00:13:08,452 --> 00:13:10,321
So it's it's actually Harold.

202
00:13:10,554 --> 00:13:11,789
It's a little complicated.

203
00:13:11,822 --> 00:13:12,890
Don't try to understand it.

204
00:13:14,859 --> 00:13:17,161
Oh, here we go now, Mike, you got my two
hundred bucks for me.

205
00:13:17,328 --> 00:13:19,230
Well, yeah, I'd like to pay you, Mr.

206
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,100
Green, but I just had to look at the wood
pile and I'm not happy.

207
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:30,741
Well, don't look at it. Just give me the
money and honest day's pay for an honest

208
00:13:30,741 --> 00:13:31,609
day's work.

209
00:13:31,642 --> 00:13:32,877
Shame on you, Mr.

210
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:34,979
Green. It was fake work.

211
00:13:35,045 --> 00:13:36,614
Mike, I was just pretending to stack the
firewood.

212
00:13:37,348 --> 00:13:39,049
Well, fine. I'll just pretend to pay it.

213
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:42,820
I got you. I got my money anyway.

214
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,556
Why don't you just give it to me and I'll be
happy to help you stack your wood, Mike?

215
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:49,093
Ok? See, that's what friends do.

216
00:13:51,762 --> 00:13:54,064
It's pretty complicated, Uncle Read, Don't
try to understand.

217
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:04,575
Building walls, we're having a game of
foosball out behind the lines, not the kind

218
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:07,978
of game I like to do something more action
at least can feel like almost like video

219
00:14:07,978 --> 00:14:09,213
game. I try to take part in that.

220
00:14:09,213 --> 00:14:11,582
But what are very defensive and that's how
they roll.

221
00:14:11,615 --> 00:14:14,251
Maybe I join. They don't like, they don't
like you to join these two.

222
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:17,688
So I'm just and I'm just standing there
watching, you know, what am I supposed to do

223
00:14:17,688 --> 00:14:19,256
watching? That's no fun.

224
00:14:22,526 --> 00:14:24,528
So they come over to see if I'm OK.

225
00:14:24,528 --> 00:14:25,829
I thought I was really just to retrieve the
ball.

226
00:14:28,766 --> 00:14:32,603
But I didn't hurt that bad, so I figured
give it one more note.

227
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,307
All right, but I'm a quick learner.

228
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,310
I'm giving my. Little gap never hurt
anybody.

229
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:43,414
Now, Walter, he's he's athletic, he's young,
and he's got the quick moves and everything.

230
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:45,215
He's got all got the feet going, got
everything going.

231
00:14:46,016 --> 00:14:49,119
Bill is what can I say that's not
insensitive?

232
00:14:52,489 --> 00:14:56,794
Yeah, that's not really says it for me, and
Bill got he got his clothes caught in one of

233
00:14:56,794 --> 00:15:06,737
the authors not noticing, so has he spins
that handle that certain bills trying to get

234
00:15:07,871 --> 00:15:09,473
get himself on the hook from that?

235
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:16,013
And then he starts to have other problems
and that is, his pant leg gets caught in

236
00:15:16,013 --> 00:15:19,883
there and then, oh. Why that is that has got
it.

237
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,854
And Walter, just in his own, in his own
world there really in, oh boy, that is.

238
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:28,625
That can't be good. So I'm pointing out, no,
we've got a problem here, and Bill is really

239
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:36,233
jammed up good. So I figure if I turn this
one counterclockwise and that just just a

240
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:38,936
little bit, just turn it. No, no, no, no,
no, that's wrong.

241
00:15:38,936 --> 00:15:40,170
That's wrong. Hey, no.

242
00:15:40,204 --> 00:15:46,109
Walter figures third one over with a good,
hard clockwise spin, and he's OK.

243
00:15:46,143 --> 00:15:47,544
Yeah, no. I think we're going to.

244
00:15:47,611 --> 00:15:52,049
We're got never got. And I think, yeah,
yeah,

245
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,651
Yeah, we got him good.

246
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:59,990
All right. Now what happened was Bill gets
up and it turns out the whole thing was a

247
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,260
ruse. He was just faking it because he had a
moon in mind.

248
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:09,766
It comes right about now, scores the winning
goal, gets into the big celebratory dance,

249
00:16:09,766 --> 00:16:11,802
but intellectual often in life.

250
00:16:11,835 --> 00:16:13,737
You don't always have the last laugh back
then.

251
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:14,771
Oh boy.

252
00:16:28,852 --> 00:16:32,322
Ernest, what about one of these fancy
stainless steel fridges?

253
00:16:32,489 --> 00:16:36,026
Oh, I know they look great from a distance,
but who wants to be looking at their

254
00:16:36,026 --> 00:16:38,662
reflection as they're reaching for a whole
bowl of gravy?

255
00:16:40,297 --> 00:16:42,165
I have two things at my disposal.

256
00:16:42,532 --> 00:16:45,001
A screwdriver and my imagination.

257
00:16:47,104 --> 00:16:48,405
They're about the same size.

258
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,778
Ever been to those fun houses?

259
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:57,981
Remember how they had those magic mirrors
that make you look skinny?

260
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:00,450
Well, those mirrors are kind of like
magicians.

261
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:02,385
They're not actually magic.

262
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:03,420
They're just a little bent.

263
00:17:15,398 --> 00:17:16,199
Ladies and gentlemen, we

264
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:19,236
Interrupt the Red-Green show so that I may
bring you the following important

265
00:17:19,236 --> 00:17:20,604
environmental message.

266
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:26,610
Greetings, campers, ranger Gord here with
another one of my patented Holderness safety

267
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:33,283
tips, say now here's a bucolic scene a
couple of amateur orthodontists out for a

268
00:17:33,283 --> 00:17:35,018
leisurely afternoon of birdwatching.

269
00:17:35,752 --> 00:17:40,957
Oh, Boy Scout Ranger hard, we're watching
those woodpeckers up there.

270
00:17:41,024 --> 00:17:44,895
Ho, ho, ho ho.

271
00:17:45,028 --> 00:17:46,429
Fine specimens, too.

272
00:17:46,997 --> 00:17:50,700
But unfortunately, what you bird brain bird
watchers don't know is that when a woodpecker

273
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,669
senses an intruder, he's liable to feel
threatened.

274
00:17:53,436 --> 00:17:57,107
That's why it's always safer to disguise
yourself as a tree or a shrubbery.

275
00:18:00,677 --> 00:18:01,344
Here we go.

276
00:18:06,783 --> 00:18:10,687
They're all safe now.

277
00:18:10,687 --> 00:18:12,022
Mr. and Mrs. Woodpecker.

278
00:18:18,928 --> 00:18:20,130
Oops, I forgot.

279
00:18:20,163 --> 00:18:22,932
There's nothing woodpeckers love more than
dead wood.

280
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:26,603
You make fun.

281
00:18:34,144 --> 00:18:36,479
You didn't have to say anything, Harold, we
were doing OK.

282
00:18:36,513 --> 00:18:37,714
You weren't telling the truth.

283
00:18:37,714 --> 00:18:38,915
When is that OK?

284
00:18:39,282 --> 00:18:40,483
Man, I wish you were married.

285
00:18:42,152 --> 00:18:46,189
Don't give me that lying is never right,
those are the rules.

286
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:50,560
So anyway, we go down to the government
offices to get the guys unemployment

287
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,831
insurance reinstated and reported that each
one of them had just had two hundred dollars

288
00:18:54,831 --> 00:18:55,965
in gainful employment.

289
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:57,767
See, which is not true.

290
00:18:57,934 --> 00:19:01,237
Well, so what? Ok, but here's what they said.

291
00:19:01,271 --> 00:19:05,375
They can't collect any of the policy until
they pay each one of them 50 bucks in income

292
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,310
tax and another four bucks in UIC,

293
00:19:07,877 --> 00:19:08,912
Which is true.

294
00:19:09,846 --> 00:19:13,550
This great country of ours can not continue
to survive if each and every person is not

295
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,051
willing to pay their fair share.

296
00:19:15,485 --> 00:19:16,953
I can't believe you still have all those
teeth.

297
00:19:24,127 --> 00:19:27,597
Let's see, our ace in the hole was we had
never identified ourselves.

298
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:32,702
We're just going to walk out scot free, but
oh no, George Washington here has to jump out

299
00:19:32,702 --> 00:19:35,471
of the cherry tree. Give them all our names
and address.

300
00:19:37,674 --> 00:19:38,775
So I called it.

301
00:19:38,808 --> 00:19:40,276
Well, it was the wrong call.

302
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,744
It was the right call.

303
00:19:42,812 --> 00:19:44,414
It was a stupid, stinking.

304
00:19:46,683 --> 00:19:48,585
You watch yourself, Mr.

305
00:19:49,218 --> 00:19:50,119
If they took on the

306
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:55,325
Stupid, stinking wrong calls in the history
of stupid, stinking wrong calls and put them

307
00:19:55,325 --> 00:19:58,127
in a stinking pile, and it was stinking.

308
00:19:58,928 --> 00:20:01,764
You could still smell your stinking call.

309
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:04,000
That's it. Yeah, right?

310
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:14,210
I was just getting a hair that, you know,
with some meeting time where everybody's out

311
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,379
of here. Let's get this.

312
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:17,580
Get you. Yeah, you're good.

313
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:25,321
You're good. So my wife is watching, I'll be
coming straight home after the meeting, I had

314
00:20:25,321 --> 00:20:30,660
no runs, no hits, a couple of errors and I'm
still hoping to get home on a fielder's

315
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:35,798
choice might even go into extra innings, but
I doubt it.

316
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:38,501
And the rest? Yeah, thanks for watching.

317
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:42,438
On behalf of myself and Harold and the whole
gang up here at Possum Ranch, keep your stick

318
00:20:42,438 --> 00:20:42,939
on the ice.

319
00:20:48,578 --> 00:20:52,682
We. All right.

320
00:20:55,785 --> 00:20:59,555
Why this he set out?

321
00:21:01,624 --> 00:21:03,025
Buyer heads for the Malmesbury.

322
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,431
I'm a man, but I can change if I have to.

323
00:21:08,598 --> 00:21:15,738
I guess. All right, as we are officially out
of the softball tournament, and I think this

324
00:21:15,738 --> 00:21:19,675
is a time for us to show a little maturity,
restrain ourselves.

325
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:21,110
Grow up a little bit.

326
00:21:21,143 --> 00:21:23,079
Suck it up. Don't worry about it.

327
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:24,747
No big deal. Nobody's fault.

328
00:21:25,114 --> 00:21:27,250
All is forgiven. That kind of thing.

329
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,452
Just let it just let it go.

330
00:21:32,688 --> 00:21:34,090
It's such a stupid call.
