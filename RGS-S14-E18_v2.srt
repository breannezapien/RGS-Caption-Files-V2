157
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:16,034
MY WHOLE FACE IS
COVERED IN WORRY LINES.

158
00:07:16,034 --> 00:07:19,671
YEAH, BUT THEY MAKE
A NICE PATTERN WITH
THE LIVER SPOTS.

159
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:21,973
YOU JUST GOTTA CHANGE
YOUR ATTITUDE, DALTON.

160
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:23,575
IF YOU CAN FIX SOMETHING,
FIX IT.

161
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:25,377
IF YOU CAN'T FIX IT,
FORGET IT.

162
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:27,946
EITHER WAY, THERE'S NO
POINT IN WORRYING ABOUT IT.

163
00:07:27,946 --> 00:07:30,449
WELL, THAT DOESN'T
ALWAYS WORK.

164
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:32,517
LIKE, I HAD THIS
SPEEDING TICKET ONCE

165
00:07:32,517 --> 00:07:34,753
THAT I COULDN'T FIX,
AND SO I FORGOT ABOUT IT,

166
00:07:34,753 --> 00:07:37,889
AND, UM, I LOST MY
LICENSE FOR TWO YEARS.

167
00:07:39,157 --> 00:07:41,326
[ APPLAUSE ]

168
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:43,829
IN THE HUMAN
DIGESTIVE SYSTEM,

169
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:45,597
THE NUTRITION IS
REPRESENTED BY TWO SEPARATE

170
00:07:45,597 --> 00:07:47,866
YET EQUALLY
IMPORTANT GROUPS...

171
00:07:47,866 --> 00:07:50,102
THE MOUTH AND STOMACH
WHO INGESTICATE FOOD,

172
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:53,638
AND THE LARGE INTESTINES
WHO REDISTRIBUTE THE OFFENDERS.

173
00:07:53,638 --> 00:07:56,074
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

174
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:04,716
Red:
BEAUTIFUL, AREN'T THEY?

175
00:08:04,716 --> 00:08:07,219
YOU KNOW, NOTHING
GETS A MAN MORE EXCITED

176
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:08,787
THAN A CUSTOMIZED CAR.

177
00:08:08,787 --> 00:08:10,755
WELL, OKAY, THERE
IS ONE OTHER THING,

178
00:08:10,755 --> 00:08:13,425
BUT A CAR'S A LOT
EASIER TO GET AHOLD OF.

179
00:08:13,425 --> 00:08:14,860
PLUS A CAR WON'T
GET MAD AT YOU

180
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,128
WHEN YOU CHECK OUT
OTHER MODELS.

181
00:08:17,128 --> 00:08:19,397
AND TRADING UP
IS A LOT CHEAPER.

182
00:08:19,397 --> 00:08:20,866
OKAY, I BETTER STOP

183
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:23,301
IN CASE BERNICE IS
ACTUALLY WATCHIN' THIS.

184
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:24,736
BUT MAYBE FOR A
GUY ON A BUDGET,

185
00:08:24,736 --> 00:08:26,571
YOU HAVE TO SKIP
THE FOUR ON THE FLOOR

186
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:29,474
AND GO DIRECTLY TO
TWO ON THE SIDEWALK.

187
00:08:29,474 --> 00:08:32,110
BUT MAYBE THERE'S
ANOTHER OPTION.

188
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,613
AND THIS IS GONNA SOUND
BLASPHEMOUS COMIN' FROM ME,

189
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:37,182
BUT WHAT ABOUT A...

190
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:38,817
BICYCLE?

191
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:40,318
JUST BECAUSE
YOU RIDE A BIKE

192
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:41,886
DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE
TO LOOK LIKE A DUFUS.

193
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:43,121
DON'T GO BY HAROLD.

194
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:44,923
NOT IF YOU TAKE A PAGE OUT
OF THOSE CAR MAGAZINES

195
00:08:44,923 --> 00:08:47,125
AND CUSTOMIZE YOUR RIDE.

196
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,027
SO TODAY ON
HANDYMAN CORNER,

197
00:08:49,027 --> 00:08:51,229
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU HOW
TO MAKE A COOL LOOKIN' BIKE.

198
00:08:51,229 --> 00:08:53,531
A DE-NERDICYCLE.

199
00:08:53,531 --> 00:08:54,899
OKAY, RIGHT AWAY,

200
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:56,801
HOW CAN YOU LOOK COOL
ON A SEAT LIKE THAT?

201
00:08:56,801 --> 00:08:59,404
IT'S LIKE STICKIN' YOUR
BUTT ON A BUNDT CAKE.

202
00:08:59,404 --> 00:09:01,740
YOU NEED SOMETHING
THAT SAYS MACK-DADDY.

203
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,708
WHATEVER THE HECK
MACK-DADDY IS.

204
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,745
I'M THINKIN'
OLD CAR WASH MITT.

205
00:09:06,745 --> 00:09:08,480
OR AS I LIKE
TO CALL IT,

206
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,982
FUN FUR UPHOLSTERY.

207
00:09:10,982 --> 00:09:12,984
OKAY, NOW, A LOT
OF THE GREAT CARS TODAY

208
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:15,053
ARE CUSTOMIZED
TO RIDE LOWER.

209
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:17,722
TEENAGERS LIKE
EVERYTHING RIDIN' LOWER...

210
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:19,224
THEIR CARS,
THEIR PANTS,

211
00:09:19,224 --> 00:09:20,992
THEIR MARKS.

212
00:09:20,992 --> 00:09:23,628
NOT TO MENTION THE
LYRICS TO THEIR RAP SONGS.

213
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:25,063
OKAY, WE CAN'T GO THAT LOW,

214
00:09:25,063 --> 00:09:26,598
BUT WE CAN DROP
THE BIKE A FEW INCHES

215
00:09:26,598 --> 00:09:29,200
BY EXTENDING THE
FORKS ON THE FRONT.

216
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,070
GET YOURSELF SOME
OLD METAL TUBING --

217
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,706
ANOTHER REASON TO
FINALLY GET THAT DISH.

218
00:09:36,808 --> 00:09:38,576
PRETTY SLICK, HUH?

219
00:09:38,576 --> 00:09:41,079
NOW, YOU'RE GONNA NEED A
COUPLE EXTRA PIECES
OF BRAKE CABLE

220
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:43,615
FOR THE ADDED DISTANCE
YOU STUCK ON THE FRONT WHEEL.

221
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:45,250
FORTUNATELY FOR ME,

222
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,519
DALTON HAS A 12-SPEED BIKE
THAT HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT.

223
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,521
WELL, I'M ASSUMING
HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT IT.

224
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:51,322
HE DIDN'T LOCK IT UP.

225
00:09:51,322 --> 00:09:53,858
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE
HOT LOOKS ON ANY HOT ROD?

226
00:09:53,858 --> 00:09:55,126
FENDER SKIRTS,

227
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:56,861
WHICH YOU CAN MAKE YOURSELF

228
00:09:56,861 --> 00:09:59,397
OUT OF ONE OF THESE
FLYING SAUCER SLEDS.

229
00:09:59,397 --> 00:10:00,865
OR IF YOU'RE ON A BUDGET,

230
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:02,901
YOU CAN USE
A GARBAGE CAN LID.

231
00:10:12,076 --> 00:10:14,479
NOW, THAT'S SEXY, HUH?

232
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:17,015
BUT THOSE HANDLE BARS
STILL LOOK A LITTLE DORKY,

233
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:18,983
SO I'M GONNA GO
WITH A LEATHER COVER

234
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:22,220
LIKE THEY HAVE ON THE STEERING
WHEEL OF A 'MASEROOTI'

235
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,623
I HAVE A PAIR OF MOOSE
THOMPSON'S PANTS HERE

236
00:10:25,623 --> 00:10:28,226
THAT I WILL NEVER RETURN,

237
00:10:28,226 --> 00:10:30,595
BECAUSE THEY COULD
BE HIS ONLY PAIR,

238
00:10:30,595 --> 00:10:33,097
AND I NEVER WANNA
SEE HIM LIKE THAT.

239
00:10:33,097 --> 00:10:35,199
GONNA TAKE OUT THE BELT

240
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:38,303
AND WIND THAT AROUND
THE HANDLE BARS.

241
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:40,772
I MAY BE ABLE TO
DO THE WHOLE FRAME.

242
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:42,473
AS THE MASSEUSE
SAID TO THE CLIENT,

243
00:10:42,473 --> 00:10:44,475
IT'S ALL ABOUT
THE LITTLE TOUCHES.

244
00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:47,612
YOU KNOW HOW THOSE SHARP CARS
HAVE THE GROUND EFFECTS?

245
00:10:47,612 --> 00:10:49,514
YOU KNOW, THOSE
CRAZY NEON LIGHTS

246
00:10:49,514 --> 00:10:51,182
DOWN UNDER THE VEHICLE?

247
00:10:51,182 --> 00:10:53,017
WELL, I'VE DONE
THE SAME THING

248
00:10:53,017 --> 00:10:54,886
BY JUST MOVING
THE BIKE HEADLIGHT

249
00:10:54,886 --> 00:10:56,487
DOWN UNDER THE UNIT.

250
00:10:56,487 --> 00:10:58,890
I MEAN, A BIKE HEADLIGHT
IS USELESS ANYWAY.

251
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,491
AND NOW WHEN SHE
SAYS YOU GOTTA GO HOME,

252
00:11:00,491 --> 00:11:02,060
YOU CAN SAY,
I CAN'T,

253
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,961
I'VE GOT NO HEADLIGHT.

254
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:06,597
AND THEN, WELL,
YOU KNOW.

255
00:11:06,597 --> 00:11:08,299
SHE'LL DRIVE YOU HOME.

256
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:10,702

LODGE MEMBERS,

00:11:10,702 --> 00:11:13,137
THE VOLUME OF THEIR EXHAUST
IS A POINT OF PRIDE.

258
00:11:13,137 --> 00:11:15,740
EVERY KID KNOWS YOU CAN MAKE A
BIKE SOUND LIKE A MOTORCYCLE

259
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,475
BY JUST HAVING A
COUPLE OF PLAYING CARDS

FLICKING AGAINST
THE SPOKES.

261
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,579
BUT I'VE ADDED A COUPLE
OF JOKERS TO THE DECK

262
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:23,581
WITH THESE MEGAPHONES.

263
00:11:23,581 --> 00:11:24,816
SPEAKING OF WHICH,

264
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:27,118
I REPLACED THE BELL WITH A
COUPLE OF TRUCK AIR HORNS.

265

[ LOUD HONK ]

00:11:29,087 --> 00:11:31,389

IN A ROAD RAGE CONFRONTATION,

267
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:33,958
YOU DON'T WANNA BE
THE ONE DOING THE TINKLING.

268
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,694
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

269
00:11:36,694 --> 00:11:39,497
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

270
00:11:39,497 --> 00:11:42,500
NOW, WE'LL JUST GET RID
OF THESE DINKY STREAMERS,

271
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,670
AND I'M GONNA GO

WHO HAVE BEEN MARRIED

274
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,590
AND ARE SPENDING ALMOST
EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY

275
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,859
WITH YOUR WIFE.

276
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:11,062
NOW, IF I WAS THE
HEAD OF THE NATIONAL
RELATIONSHIP SECURITY,

277
00:12:11,062 --> 00:12:14,365
I'D BE PUTTIN' YOU
ON ELEVATED ALERT.

YOU ARE IN A CRISIS
SITUATION, MY FRIEND.

279
00:12:17,268 --> 00:12:19,237
BUT I HAVE THE SOLUTION.

280
00:12:19,237 --> 00:12:22,740
YOU NEED TO FIND
A GIRLFRIEND.

281
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,110
NOT FOR YOURSELF.

282
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,247
YOU NEED TO FIND A
GIRLFRIEND FOR YOUR WIFE.

283
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:32,249
SEE, YOUR WIFE HAS A LOT OF
INTERESTS THAT YOU DON'T,

284
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:35,086
AND SHE NEEDS TO TALK
ABOUT THEM TO SOMEBODY,

285
00:12:35,086 --> 00:12:39,357
SOMEBODY WHO CARES ABOUT WHAT
PURSE GOES WITH WHAT SHOES.

286
00:12:39,357 --> 00:12:43,527
OR WHETHER SOME ACTOR'S

OR ANYTHING, REALLY.

IF SHE DOESN'T
HAVE A GIRLFRIEND,

289
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:49,834
THAT LEAVES YOU.

AND SHE'S EVEN MORE UPSET
ABOUT THAT THAN YOU ARE.

291
00:12:53,637 --> 00:12:56,907
NOW, THE FIRST PLACE TO LOOK
IS THE WIVES OF YOUR FRIENDS.

292
00:12:56,907 --> 00:12:58,876
BECAUSE IF YOUR FRIENDS
ARE ANYTHING LIKE YOU,

293
00:12:58,876 --> 00:13:01,045
THEY'RE PROBABLY
IN THE SAME BOAT.

294
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:03,547
BUT EVEN IF IT'S A GUY
YOU THINK IS A REAL DINK,

295
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:05,082
IF YOUR WIFE
LIKES HIS WIFE,

296
00:13:05,082 --> 00:13:08,052
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM.

297
00:13:08,052 --> 00:13:11,055
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE THE ONLY
FRIEND YOUR WIFE HAS,

298

YOUR LIFE WILL
BECOME A LIVING HELL.

00:13:14,091 --> 00:13:16,827
SO GO OUT THERE AND
FIND HER A GIRLFRIEND.

300
00:13:16,827 --> 00:13:20,765
IF YOU DON'T, SHE MAY GO OUT
AND FIND HERSELF A BOYFRIEND.

IN HIS BEST INTEREST.

MORE COORDINATED THAN THAT.

INJURED PLAYING VOLLEYBALL.

CAN FIND A WAY.

IT'S GETTING PRETTY

THERE WAS A BIT
OF A CLUE ON THERE.

STANDING UP JUST
FOR A MINUTE?

472
00:21:21,844 --> 00:21:23,546
HAROLD, ON BEHALF
OF THE LODGE,

473
00:21:23,546 --> 00:21:24,914

POSSUM DROP,

AND WE'RE WONDERING

476
00:21:28,618 --> 00:21:31,454
IF YOU'D MIND DOING
IT ONE MORE TIME?

477
00:21:34,056 --> 00:21:36,125
NOT A CHANCE!

478
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:39,996
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
TOO TIRED?
