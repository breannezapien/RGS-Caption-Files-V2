AND A JAR OF GRAVOL.

29
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:26,519

30
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,520
UP AT THE LODGE THIS WEEK

31
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,354
SO I ENDED UP WITH SOME TIME

32
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:29,355
ON MY HANDS SO I THOUGHT

33
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:30,523
WELL MAYBE I'LL CLEAN OUT

34
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:33,393

OUT OF THE FRONT HALL

37
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:36,929

00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:38,598
A LOOK AT THIS MONTH'S MAIL.

39

>>RED: NO MISTER SPOCK

44
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,772
IT DID NOT, HOWEVER

45
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,207

46
00:01:48,207 --> 00:01:51,511
>>HAROLD: NO OH GOOD

47
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:52,145

50
00:01:54,313 --> 00:01:54,981
>>RED: YOU KNOW I THOUGHT

51
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,116
IT WAS KIND OF ODD THAT

52
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:58,051
MY NEPHEW'S REPORT CARD WOULD

53
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,152
COME HERE TO POSSUM LODGE

54
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,154
RATHER THAN HIS HOME

55
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:01,954
WHERE HIS PARENTS ARE

56
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:02,855
DOESN'T THAT SEEM UNUSUAL

57
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:08,628

58
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:15,268
>>HAROLD: NOPE.

59
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:15,935

60
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:17,303
>>RED: OH WE'LL TALK ABOUT

61
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,172
IT LATER I GUESS.

62
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,640
BUT ON A HAPPIER NOTE GOT THIS

63
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,541
APPLICATION FORM FROM THE

64
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,743

WE GET OURSELVES CLASSIFIED

66
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,447
AS A RECREATIONAL TOURIST

67
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,582
ATTRACTION THEY WILL GIVE

68
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:31,651
US A GRANT FOR UPGRADING

69
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,418

70
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,320
>>HAROLD: GOVERNMENT MONEY?

73
00:02:38,724 --> 00:02:39,358
YOU'RE TURNING YOUR BACK

74
00:02:39,358 --> 00:02:40,560
ON THE FREE MARKET CAPITALIST

75
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,427
SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE CREATED

76
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:42,361

77
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:43,896
IN THIS FINE GREAT OUTSTANDING

78
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:46,799
COUNTRY OF OURS SIR!

79
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,167
>>RED: IT'S $50,000 HAROLD.

80
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:48,768
>>HAROLD: WELL I'M IN THERE

81
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:49,635
LIKE A DIRTY SHIRT

82
00:02:49,635 --> 00:02:50,570
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

83
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,637
IT'S NOT ME IT'S THE OTHERS

84
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:52,772
I'M THINKING ABOUT.

85
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:53,439
>>RED: THEY'RE THERE WE SHOULD

86
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,607
BE THERE.

87
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:55,741
OF COURSE WE DON'T NEED THAT

88
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:56,842
MUCH MONEY THE WHOLE LODGE

89
00:02:56,842 --> 00:02:58,277
IS ONLY WORTH 20...

90
00:02:58,277 --> 00:02:59,245
BUT I FIGURE GOSH IF I CAN GET

91
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,680
EVEN $300 BUCKS GET MYSELF

92
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,515
HALF A DOZEN REPOED BOATS

93
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,783
OR WHAT HAVE YOU THAT'D

94
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:04,884
BE FINE AND THEN I THOUGHT

95
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:05,851
TO MYSELF GEE I'M NOT SURE

96
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:08,821
THAT POSSUM LODGDGULD QUALIFY

97
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,423
BUT THEN I THOUGHT BY GOLLY

98
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:11,390
IT WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE THE LODGE

99
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,059
MORE CANADIAN IF THE BUSINESS

100
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:16,562

00:15:47,444 --> 00:15:48,245
SOMETHING ELSE,

508
00:15:48,245 --> 00:15:50,280
HE'S GOT A BIT OF STRAW THERE

509
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,949
ON A SHOVEL AND HE WANTS

510
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:53,383
ME TO GET THE WHEELS TURNING

511
00:15:53,383 --> 00:15:54,718

512
00:15:54,718 --> 00:15:55,953
IN THERE AND THAT'S GOING TO

513
00:15:55,953 --> 00:15:57,020

ROMAN NUMERAL 11, TRES COOL!

547
00:16:56,713 --> 00:16:57,981
ALMOST A METAPHOR.

548
00:16:57,981 --> 00:16:59,082
CREATES THE SUGGESTION OF

549
00:16:59,082 --> 00:17:01,051
A SEQUEL IMPLYING PREVIOUS

550
00:17:01,051 --> 00:17:05,922
SUCCESS, ALWAYS THINKING.

551
00:17:05,922 --> 00:17:07,290
OKAY ALL RIGHT THE

552
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,226
BOTTOM LINE IS RESPECT,

553
00:17:09,226 --> 00:17:10,527
I MEAN RESPECT MY FRIENDLIES

554
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:12,896
IS A 2 WAY STREET, ALL RIGHT?

555
00:17:12,896 --> 00:17:14,197
YOU HAVE TO RESPECT THE TEACHER

556
00:17:14,197 --> 00:17:15,966
AND THE TEACHER HAS TO RESPECT

557
00:17:15,966 --> 00:17:17,834
YOU ONLY YOU KNOW YOU

558
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:19,503
GOT TO GO FIRST.

559
00:17:19,503 --> 00:17:20,570
AND THE BEST WAY I FOUND TO

560
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:21,538
EARN THEIR RESPECT IS ONCE

561
00:17:21,538 --> 00:17:22,806
A MONTH YOU WASH, WAX AND

562
00:17:22,806 --> 00:17:25,642
VACUUM THEIR CAR.

563
00:17:25,642 --> 00:17:26,676
THIS CREATES A SPIRIT OF

564
00:17:26,676 --> 00:17:28,712
COOPERATION YES ALTHOUGH IT

565
00:17:28,712 --> 00:17:29,679

566
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,415

00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:42,893
AND THE TEACHER SAYS WELL

574
00:17:42,893 --> 00:17:45,362
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU WON'T I?

575
00:17:45,362 --> 00:17:46,129
RIGHT THERE YOU SEE THAT'S

576
00:17:46,129 --> 00:17:46,930
BETTER THAN A FLAT

577
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,399
NO LIKE LAST TIME.

578
00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:50,367

ONE THING, SEX AND VIOLENCE

596
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:25,735
SO I THINK WHAT THE SCHOOLS

597
00:18:25,735 --> 00:18:26,803
SHOULD DO IS KIND OF STRESS

598
00:18:26,803 --> 00:18:28,104

00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:50,827
DROP THE RAP MUSIC AND

615
00:18:50,827 --> 00:18:52,095
THE MADONNA VIDEOS AND

616
00:18:52,095 --> 00:18:52,962
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS

617
00:18:52,962 --> 00:18:54,330
SHAKESPEARE STUFF

618

00:20:16,312 --> 00:20:17,447
OLD JOB BEING PRESIDENT

673
00:20:17,447 --> 00:20:19,782
ALL THOSE PRESS CONFERENCES

674
00:20:19,782 --> 00:20:21,284
AND THE SUMMIT TALKS AND

675
00:20:21,284 --> 00:20:23,986
THE ASSASSINATIONS,

676
00:20:23,986 --> 00:20:25,021
I FOUND IT REAL HARD TO

677
00:20:25,021 --> 00:20:28,391
RELAX WHEN I WAS IN OFFICE.

678
00:20:28,391 --> 00:20:29,892
>>RED: YOU WERE PRESIDENT HAP?

679
00:20:29,892 --> 00:20:30,927
>>HAP: OH JUST A COUPLE OF

680
00:20:30,927 --> 00:20:32,028
WEEKS SUBBED IN FOR NIXON

681
00:20:32,028 --> 00:20:32,829
SO HE COULD TAKE THE

682
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:36,265
FAMILY TO A CLUB MED.

683
00:20:36,265 --> 00:20:36,999
>>RED: ALL RIGHT HAP

684
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:37,934
THAT'S CLOSE ENOUGH

685
00:20:37,934 --> 00:20:40,803
I THINK I CAN SWIM FROM HERE.

686
00:20:40,803 --> 00:20:43,706
(LOUD SPLASH)

687
00:20:45,074 --> 00:20:45,942
>>RED: WELL BY GOLLY YOU'RE

688
00:20:45,942 --> 00:20:46,876
NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS

689

TO BE STINKING RICH!

696
00:20:56,018 --> 00:20:56,986
