1
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:10,343
Don't you hate it when
windshield washer technology

2
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,146
actually makes the windshield
harder to see out of?

3
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,049
You know there's
an old expression,

4
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,051
never send a boy
on a man's job

5
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,252
or if you're
a lodge member,

6
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:21,354
never send Harold
on any job.

7
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:22,722
So if you want
a clean windshield,

8
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:25,792
you need a man-sized
windshield washer.

9
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,461
You see this tiny,
little, puny thing here?

10
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:31,197
This is a standard
windshield washer pump.

11
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,166
This is for
little squirts.

12
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,235
We're going to take
that up a notch.

13
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:38,271
This baby will really fire
out the water.

14
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:40,373
And speaking of fires,

15
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,842
we're also going to
biggie size our nozzle.

16
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:48,448
I got my pump running off
the fan belt,

17
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:51,751
and I'm using a water cooler
bottle as my reservoir.

18
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:54,721
There were a whole pile
of these behind the 7-11.

19
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,223
Okay, I think we're ready
for a road test.

20
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:18,344
My windshield's dirty.

21
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:29,489
Thanks.

Bit of a setback this week
up at the lodge.

27
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,482
Stinky Peterson has come up
with a new recipe

28
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:59,485
for pickled eggs
au gratin.

29
00:01:59,485 --> 00:02:02,588

by the environmental
protection agency.

Uncle Red!
Uncle Red!

31
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,126
We have to
clean up the lodge.

32
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:08,494
We did.

33
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,801
No, not just sort it
into heaps by smell... clean.

34
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,069
The Ontario Tourism Board
is coming into this area,

35
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:18,805
and they're going to be
inspecting all the resorts

36
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,540
so they can, you know,
rate them for their brochure

37
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,074
and we cannot afford
to have another rating

38
00:02:22,074 --> 00:02:24,877
of "dangerous
to all life forms."

39
00:02:24,877 --> 00:02:27,079
What are you talking
about, Harold?

40
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:29,348
Last year we got
three stars.

41
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:31,784
Those were 'X's!

42
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:36,656
We're the only triple-X
rated lodge in the
entire province.

43
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,691
That's why we had so few
people here, you know.

44
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,561
And the ones who did come,
we didn't want.

45
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,396
Well, who cares, Harold?

46
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:44,564
We get along fine up here

47
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,799
without all those
yuppie families coming up

48
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,335
with their kiwi suntan lotion
and their bottled water.

49

they're from another planet.

They've cleaned
everything up.

There's no propane tanks
piled up everywhere.

There's no car engines
hanging from the trees.

There's no empties
on the roof.

60
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:15,628
Well, they're just trying
to suck up to the
tourist board.

I know that.

to tell you

that they're going to kick
our butt in the ratings.

64

They're bragging that they're
going to make Possum Lodge
look like a dump.

Don't you worry.
You beat 'em to that.

66

Harold, we beat em
to almost everything.

67
00:03:31,944 --> 00:03:34,647
We hardly ever lose a
competition to Caribou Lodge.

you guys had better

this place --

to pitch in.

Is that what you were
really going to say?

I guess not.

75

Because that's demeaning,
sexist and politically
incorrect.

throwing stoves

and snowmobiles
in this lake all

You know what you do?

You go get fish
in another lake

147
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:55,647
and them dip them
in here to preserve them.

Oh yeah?

149
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,051
Well, what do you think
about this, Harold, eh?

150
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,920
See what happens when you
have skills and use
the right bait?

151
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:07,893
Now, do you want
to throw that back,

152
00:07:07,893 --> 00:07:09,661
or do you want to try
and clean it?

153
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:11,596
It's a fish.

you can sit,

"Never sit when
you can lie down

157

"and never lie down
without the remote."

158
00:07:30,248 --> 00:07:31,917
Sounds like
my kind of guy,

159
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:34,086

had to cut his own lawn.

00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,421
What with him being King
of Ireland or whatever it was.

161
00:07:37,823 --> 00:07:40,192
So this time I'm going to
show you how you can
cut your lawn

162
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:41,526
without using
any energy...

163
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:43,361
well, not any
of your own energy.

164
00:07:43,361 --> 00:07:44,896
First think
you want to do,

165
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:48,066
get yourself one of these
self-propelled electric
lawn mowers.

166
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:49,367
I got this from Mike.

167
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:51,002
He's good for getting
stuff cheap

168
00:07:51,002 --> 00:07:52,504
if you don't ask
too many questions.

169
00:07:52,504 --> 00:07:54,005
You know what they say...

170
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:55,607
A good fence makes
a good neighbour.

171
00:07:55,607 --> 00:07:58,009
Now, the electric units are
not as good as the gas jobs

172
00:07:58,009 --> 00:07:59,277
but they're quieter.

173
00:07:59,277 --> 00:08:01,379
And I find it hard
to sleep in the same yard

174
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:05,450
as an unmanned, self-propelled
gasoline mower.

175
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,386
Now, there's a bit of
complicated math involved
with this project.

176
00:08:08,386 --> 00:08:10,922
The lawn mower's going to
wind around the wheel rim

177
00:08:10,922 --> 00:08:12,657
and move itself
across the lawn.

178
00:08:12,657 --> 00:08:14,793
But to prevent it
from missing a spot,

179
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:16,995
the circumference
of the wheel rim

180
00:08:16,995 --> 00:08:20,198
has to be the same as
the width of the lawn mower.

181
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:22,067
The actual formula,
I believe,

182
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:25,637
is 2 pi R = coupe de grasse.

183
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:29,241
Perfect.

184
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:33,812
To calculate pi, just get
yourself a pie plate.

185
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:41,119
Okay, here's
the easy part.

186
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:43,888
Just plug the lawn mower
into the extension cord

187
00:08:43,888 --> 00:08:47,125
and then tie it off
to the front of the mower.

188
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,793
The first time you
cut the lawn, now,

189
00:08:48,793 --> 00:08:50,462
you'll have a few obstacles
you might have to get through,

190
00:08:50,462 --> 00:08:54,432
So mount an
electric chain saw
on the front of the unit

191
00:08:54,432 --> 00:08:57,002
and you want to plug
that in too.

192
00:08:57,002 --> 00:09:00,405
Then you just
turn them both on,

193
00:09:00,405 --> 00:09:02,841
and you're good to go.

194
00:09:02,841 --> 00:09:05,710
Might want to move
the dog inside first.

195
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,851
Okay, this pretty much
looks like the centre
of the yard to me.

196
00:09:12,851 --> 00:09:16,354
Even if it isn't,
it will be.

197
00:09:17,922 --> 00:09:20,425
Just wind the extension
around the rim,

198
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:22,227
and then
go plug her in.

199
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:24,329
You want to keep the cord
good and high though;

200
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:26,931
otherwise, your automatic
lawn mower will have

201
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:29,134
the same history
as America...

202
00:09:29,134 --> 00:09:31,336
just one revolution.

203
00:09:32,303 --> 00:09:33,938
Other than that,
it's just like a computer,

204
00:09:33,938 --> 00:09:35,807
plug and play.

205
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:38,176
Sure hope
it doesn't crash.

206
00:10:24,422 --> 00:10:27,759
[ APPLAUSE ]

207
00:10:37,635 --> 00:10:39,437
I want to talk
to you older guys

208
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:42,507
who've been married for
as long as you can remember --

209
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:45,176
or are allowed
to remember.

210
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:49,347
You know, it never
hurts to surprise your
significant other,

211
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:50,915
maybe buy her something

212
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:52,517
or make her something.

213
00:10:52,517 --> 00:10:55,186
I suggest
buy her something.

214
00:10:55,186 --> 00:10:58,122
Your wife knows how good
a handyman you are.

215
00:10:58,122 --> 00:11:00,958
Heck, she's the one who
drives you to the hospital.

216
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,227
So buy her something.

217
00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:05,663
In fact,
buy her flowers.

218
00:11:05,663 --> 00:11:07,598
Now, most men think
flowers are dumb,

219
00:11:07,598 --> 00:11:11,102
but get this:
women don't.

220
00:11:11,102 --> 00:11:13,738
Bernice actually
likes flowers.

221
00:11:13,738 --> 00:11:16,641
A bunch of flowers to her
is like, I don't know,

222
00:11:16,641 --> 00:11:19,277
a '68 orange Dodge Charger

223
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:23,948
with a racing cam
and a Hurst shifter.

224
00:11:23,948 --> 00:11:25,817
So I buy
Bernice flowers.

225
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:27,685
Most guys don't
think that way.

226
00:11:27,685 --> 00:11:30,822
They get their sweethearts
something they'd like
themselves.

227
00:11:30,822 --> 00:11:33,057
You ladies who receive
belt sanders for Christmas

228
00:11:33,057 --> 00:11:35,159
know what
I'm talking about.

229
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:37,128
So if you want to make
your partner happy,

230
00:11:37,128 --> 00:11:39,730
give her something
she may actually want

231
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,134
and she may give you
something you actually want.

232
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:45,770
Something that used to
happen in the back seat

233
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,139
of that '68 Charger.

234
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:50,074
Remember,
I'm pulling for you.

235
00:11:50,074 --> 00:11:52,410
We're all in this together.

236
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,046
[ APPLAUSE ]

237
00:11:55,046 --> 00:11:57,849
Have your septics
pumped our regularly.

238
00:11:57,849 --> 00:12:00,418
An ounce of prevention...

239
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:03,154
is worth a ton of manure.

240
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:15,399
I'll be right with you!

241
00:12:27,111 --> 00:12:29,146
Well, uh,
as you can see,

242
00:12:29,146 --> 00:12:30,948
getting the lodge
cleaned up a little,

243
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:33,517
getting ready for the tourist
board ratings inspection.

244
00:12:33,517 --> 00:12:37,021
We looked into getting
a cleaning la -- person.

245
00:12:37,021 --> 00:12:40,358
But we found it
demeaning... for us.

246
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:43,227
We couldn't come up
with 150 bucks.

247
00:12:43,227 --> 00:12:45,630
Uncle Red?
Wow!

248
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,565
You're really
cleaning up in here.

249
00:12:47,565 --> 00:12:49,433
Have you cleaned up
your room, Harold,

250
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:51,535
because if the tourist
board sees the Ken and
Barbie dolls,

251
00:12:51,535 --> 00:12:54,505
they'll rate us
as a day-care centre.

252
00:12:54,505 --> 00:12:57,074
Those are Star Wars
collectible figurines,

253
00:12:57,074 --> 00:12:59,076
thank you very much.

254
00:12:59,076 --> 00:13:01,479
And my room is always
neat and tidy.

255
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:04,648
Well, that's because
nothing ever happens
in it.

256
00:13:04,648 --> 00:13:06,584
Okay, Red.

257
00:13:06,584 --> 00:13:08,619
Got the basement
all cleaned up.
Okay.

258
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:11,222
Oh, by the way,
can we get rid of
all these animal heads?

259
00:13:11,222 --> 00:13:14,058
They are just
impossible to dust.

260
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:19,363
We can talk about it.

261
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:21,832
Say, you know what,
you look good.

262
00:13:21,832 --> 00:13:23,467
Is that a new shirt?

263
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:25,402
No, you know,
I just washed it

264
00:13:25,402 --> 00:13:27,104
but I'm using a new
fabric softener,

265
00:13:27,104 --> 00:13:29,173
and I think it really
makes a difference.

266
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:31,175
Yeah, you know what,
it's real nice.

267
00:13:31,175 --> 00:13:33,410
It really brings out
the colour in your eyes.

268
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,514
Would you two
like to be alone?

269
00:13:36,514 --> 00:13:39,216
You know, you started
this, Harold.

270
00:13:39,216 --> 00:13:40,951
No, no, no, no, no.
I just wanted the lodge

271
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:43,954
to have a better tourist
rating so we attract
better tourists.

272
00:13:43,954 --> 00:13:46,257
We want to beat
Caribou Lodge!

273
00:13:46,257 --> 00:13:48,092
Caribou Lodge
is not the point!

274
00:13:48,092 --> 00:13:49,793
If we all get
good ratings

275
00:13:49,793 --> 00:13:51,362
then there's enough
business for everybody.

276
00:13:51,362 --> 00:13:53,063
Well, we know that,
Harold.

277
00:13:53,063 --> 00:13:54,899
It just kind of fosters
the competitive spirit

278
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:57,768
if we can beat the crap
out of those morons.

279
00:13:57,768 --> 00:13:59,570
No, it's not about that!

280
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,505
It has nothing to do with us
beating Caribou Lodge.

281
00:14:01,505 --> 00:14:03,641
There is no competition.

282
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:05,809
Okay.

283
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:10,347
I'm serious, guys,
there is no competition.

284
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:12,483
That's a good one.

285
00:14:12,483 --> 00:14:14,485
Besides, Caribou Lodge
has put in a hot tub.

286
00:14:14,485 --> 00:14:16,387
Holy --

287
00:14:16,387 --> 00:14:18,689
They can't do that!

288
00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:20,591
It's not
a competition.

289
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:28,932
RED: We were going to have a
sleepout just under the stars.

290
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:30,734
The sky was looking
a little rough there.

291
00:14:30,734 --> 00:14:32,703
Heard some thunder and
it looked like maybe
she might rain.

292
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,506
So Mike had the idea
of maybe putting up
some kind of a tarp.

293
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:37,207
He had a small tarp in --

294
00:14:37,207 --> 00:14:39,109
What I thought was
a small tarp in his bag.

295
00:14:39,109 --> 00:14:40,644
It's funny how
these things --

296
00:14:40,644 --> 00:14:42,313
You know, as you unfold
them you realize

297
00:14:42,313 --> 00:14:44,548
how huge something
like that --

298
00:14:44,548 --> 00:14:46,183
And it seemed a little
heavier than a normal tarp.

299
00:14:46,183 --> 00:14:49,386
Of course, that's because
there was a fry pan stuck
in the middle.

300
00:14:49,386 --> 00:14:51,121
We got that out of there

301
00:14:51,121 --> 00:14:52,489
and then Mike just tied up
the one corner to the tree.

302
00:14:52,489 --> 00:14:54,525
I wouldn't --
Look out --

303
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:57,094
So later that day,

304
00:14:57,094 --> 00:14:58,629
we got Mike up higher
in the tree

305
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:00,497
standing on Winston's
shoulders

306
00:15:00,497 --> 00:15:02,232
who was unfortunately
standing on my shoulders.

307
00:15:02,232 --> 00:15:04,334
You know, we did that okay
leaning against the tree,

308
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:06,003
but when it came
time to move

309
00:15:06,003 --> 00:15:08,105
it was very hard to balance
and these guys are not --

310
00:15:08,105 --> 00:15:10,140
It's not Cirque de Soleil
we got here, you know.

311
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,678
But anyway we did
get the tarp up,

312
00:15:14,678 --> 00:15:16,513
and we got under it
in our sleeping bags.

313
00:15:16,513 --> 00:15:18,449
She was raining down
there pretty good,

314
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:19,850

overnight thing.

beautiful day, beautiful day

but we are looking up

and thinking, oh boy.

318
00:15:26,557 --> 00:15:28,592
We collected some
rainwater overnight

319
00:15:28,592 --> 00:15:32,796
and a certain amount of debris
that comes with any
kind of a rain.

320
00:15:32,796 --> 00:15:35,232
So we're trying -- Mike said,
"oh no, come on back."

This is how you use
what nature gives you.

323
00:15:38,368 --> 00:15:40,237
He takes out his knife
and he drops in and --

324
00:15:40,237 --> 00:15:43,440
Not too sharp
there, Mike.

Ah.

326
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:47,477
So Mike's not too
sharp either.

327
00:15:47,477 --> 00:15:49,546
What he's doing is making
a little camp shower.

328
00:15:49,546 --> 00:15:51,481
So he's showering away,

329
00:15:51,481 --> 00:15:53,550
and then the water
stopped there.

330
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,885
Something's
plugging it, Mike.

331
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:56,320
Oh, it's a pine cone.

and away he goes again.

Then she plugs up again

334
00:16:00,257 --> 00:16:02,259
and this time it's a pop can
and Mike's had enough.

335
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:04,595
So Winston steps up
and his hat was dirty.

336
00:16:04,595 --> 00:16:06,763
So he washed that
and we thought --

337

Oh.

338
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:12,135
There's a very large snake
indigenous to the area.

339
00:16:12,135 --> 00:16:15,072
We get back to the campfire
and the water stops again.

340
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:16,940
Winston thinks it's like
a twig or something,

341
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,543
but of course
it's not really a twig,

it's the actual snake.

this part happened.

dead it was just stunned.
