See, I'm not prejudiced

I may not have any
education at all.

But I got a good imagination

140
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:28,654
and I know how things work

141
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:29,755
and I have a wife

different thing.

for you to follow it.

I'm pretty excited here.

00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:20,839
I replace the blade
of the lawn mower
with a pulley

155
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,708
and I've strung
this drivebelt

156
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,676
over to the pulley
on the alternator.

157
00:07:24,676 --> 00:07:26,278
So when the lawn mower
starts up,

158
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:28,513
the alternator will generate
enough electricity

159
00:07:28,513 --> 00:07:31,817
to run both the ceiling fan
and the garbage disposal.

160
00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:33,819
Now the ceiling fan
is mounted like this

161
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:36,755
so when the corn gets as
high as an elephant's eye,

162

the fan'll poke it's eye
out by lopping off an ear.

163
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,828
Which will make it
fly through the air

164
00:07:42,828 --> 00:07:44,563
and land in the
kitchen sink.

165
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:46,898
That'll kick on the
garbage disposal

166
00:07:46,898 --> 00:07:48,166
which mulches the corn

167
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,901
and drops it into
our oil drum

168
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:53,071
where it decomposes and
ferments into ethanol.

169
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:54,272
Which is better
than gasoline

170
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:56,641
because it makes your
exhaust smell like popcorn.

171
00:07:56,641 --> 00:07:59,945
Now, obviously, the ethanol
gets siphoned down through
our garden hose

00:07:59,945 --> 00:08:02,747
back into the fuel
tank of the lawn mower

out there wondering,

Hey, what about the

Well don't forget, this is
a perpetual motion machine

178
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,433
which means, well I
believe the word perpetual

179
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:24,035
means a long, long time.

180

You married folks know
what I'm talking about.

181
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:29,140
The downspout recycles
some of the corn seeds

182
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,076
back into the ground.

the corn just
keeps on coming.

than smelling a no onions.

I know people, as soon
as they walk up to me,

when people are friends,

they never really
say goodbye,

they stay in each

every good memory

knocked a hair
out of your head.

So when you see
an old bald guy,

you know he's had
a pretty good life.

212
00:09:59,297 --> 00:10:01,166
I guess the main point
I'm trying to make here

213
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,300
is that the
pattern of life

214
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,736
is such that nothing
lasts forever.

215

You're not supposed to get
pregnant when you're 72

and nobody over 40 should
ever take their shirt off.

217
00:10:12,277 --> 00:10:13,478
So as we go through life,

218
00:10:13,478 --> 00:10:16,614
it's important that we move
from one phase to the next

219
00:10:16,614 --> 00:10:18,483
and we have to say
goodbye to the one

220
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:20,852
so that we can say
hello to the next.

hold the walnuts.

a little bit tired there.

And what he didn't notice

was that the tree
had already been
topped earlier

the skeet thrower worked.

You handed me the skeet

to go over there

You were searching for
metal in the ground

by mistake and caught
it on the van

We had kind of a
lacrosse-baseball mix

where Bill had
the lacrosse suit on,

he pitched the
lacrosse balls to me

with a baseball bat

though we're married,

478
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,095
I'm still going to want
to come back to the lodge

479
00:19:59,095 --> 00:20:00,797
every now and then.

480
00:20:00,797 --> 00:20:02,231
Well, well, well,

481
00:20:02,231 --> 00:20:05,768
you've turned
into a man.

482
00:20:05,768 --> 00:20:08,571
I hope that's
a compliment.

483
00:20:08,571 --> 00:20:10,606
Oh, I almost forgot.

484
00:20:10,606 --> 00:20:13,910
Here's your
wedding gift.

485
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:17,313
Wow, that's a big
roll of duct tape.

486
00:20:17,313 --> 00:20:18,414
It is, Harold.

487
00:20:18,414 --> 00:20:21,417
I figured you're going
to be married a long time.

488
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:22,418
And to the rest of you

489
00:20:22,418 --> 00:20:24,587
who've been watching us
all these years,

490
00:20:24,587 --> 00:20:27,223
on behalf of myself
and the married man

491
00:20:27,223 --> 00:20:30,026
and the whole gang
up here at Possum Lodge,

492
00:20:30,026 --> 00:20:34,731
Keep your stick on the ice.

C'mon everybody.

Hurry up, guys, sit down.

All rise.

Quando omni flunkus moritati.

Sit down.

00:20:57,854 --> 00:21:01,691
Bow your heads for
the revised man's prayer.

501
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:03,259
I'm a man

502
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:04,894
but I changed

503
00:21:04,894 --> 00:21:06,562
because I had to

504
00:21:06,562 --> 00:21:11,000
oh well.

The years that followed

507
00:21:18,474 --> 00:21:20,910
saw a lot of changes
to the lodge members.

508
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,080
Mike Hammer became the
police chief of Possum Lake.

509
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,882
With Mike having
a legitimate job,

510
00:21:25,882 --> 00:21:28,684
the crime rate
dropped to zero.

511
00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:31,954
Winston got a job investigating
government corruption.

512
00:21:31,954 --> 00:21:33,823
He knew the territory.

513
00:21:33,823 --> 00:21:36,392
Dalton and Anne-Marie took
a second chance at happiness

514
00:21:36,392 --> 00:21:38,761
by renewing their vows.

515
00:21:38,761 --> 00:21:42,665
Ed Frid became the leader of
the local animal rights group.

516
00:21:42,665 --> 00:21:46,535
Hap Shaughnessy told us he'd
been appointed ambassador
to Guam.

517
00:21:46,535 --> 00:21:48,738
We hoped it was true.

518
00:21:48,738 --> 00:21:52,441
Edgar K.B. Montrose attempted
to make his own heated recliner

519
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:54,810
using plastic explosives.

520
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,146
Hasn't been heard from since.

521
00:21:57,146 --> 00:22:01,117
Harold and Bonnie were slowly
taking over the community.

522
00:22:01,117 --> 00:22:05,621
In fact, everybody
changed except me.
