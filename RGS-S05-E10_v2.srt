(Radio static and beeping)

2
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:10,510
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

3
00:00:10,576 --> 00:00:12,779
HERE'S A MAN WHO KNOWS NO PEER,

4
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:15,815
AND YOU CAN TELL
BY HOW HE DOCKS HIS BOAT.

5
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:19,552
MY UNCLE, YOUR HOST, RED GREEN!

6
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,422
(Applause)

7
00:00:22,488 --> 00:00:23,923
THANK YOU.

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,259
HEY, THERE, HAROLD.

9
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:27,627
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

10
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,961
WE'RE HAVING TROUBLE

11
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:30,296
WITH THE PHONE LINES.

12
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,631
(Ringing)

13
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,633
EXCUSE ME A MINUTE.

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,869
STOP USING THE PHONE.

15
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,905
EXCELLENT PHONE MANNERS.

16
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:41,007
IT STARTED WHEN
HAROLD HOOKED UP

17
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,943
HIS COMBINATION FAX/MODEM
AND WAFFLE TOASTER.

18
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,479
WELDED EVERYBODY'S
PHONE LINES TOGETHER

19
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,147
SO WE ALL GET EVERY CALL.

20
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,549
(Ringing)

21
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:51,351
THAT'S MY COMPUTER FRIENDS.

22
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:57,123
WRONG NUMBER.

23
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:04,897
(Applause and cheering)

24
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:06,833
THAT WAS CLEVER.

25
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:09,268
WHAT WILL WE DO NOW?

26
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:12,305
THE PHONE SYSTEM WON'T BE FIXED
BY THE PHONE COMPANY.

27
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,407
THEY KEEP CARPING
ABOUT UNPAID BILLS,

28
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,642
AS IF THAT'S GONNA MAKE
ANY DIFFERENCE.

29
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:18,644
WE'RE SWITCHING
TO A BETTER SYSTEM.

30
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:20,079
WE'RE GOING BACK TO C.B.

31
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,749
DOWNWIND DANGER --
COME IN, DOWNWIND DANGER.

32
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:24,083
DOWNWIND
DANGER?

33
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,152
STINKY PETERSON.

37
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:46,005
(Red): I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO
MAKE YOUR OWN PAY PHONE BOOTH,

38
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:50,009
BUZZ WILL BRING US A BARRAGE
OF OPINION WITHOUT ANY POINT,

39
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:51,544
I'LL TRY TO GET MIKE

40
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,013
TO FINALLY ACCEPT
RESPONSIBILITY,

41
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,782
AND GARTH HARBLE WILL TRY

42
00:01:55,848 --> 00:01:57,350
AND BAG A FEW GEESE.

43
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,290
(Junior Singleton on radio)

44
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,793
IT'S NOT RAINING HERE, EITHER.

45
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:09,462
YOU'RE NOT THAT FAR AWAY.

46
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:10,797
I SEE YOU OUT THE WINDOW.

47
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:12,131
(Talking)

48
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,466
I'M NOT GONNA WAVE.

49
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:14,801
(Talking)

50
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:16,803
OH, FOR GOSH SAKES.

51
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:19,472
OVER AND OUT.

52
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,407
HOW'S THE COMMUNICATION
NETWORK WORKING OUT?

53
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,742
NOT BAD.

54
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,478
YOU ALWAYS GET GUYS
THAT ABUSE THE SYSTEM.

55
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:28,047
MOST MEN DON'T WANT
SOMEONE TO TALK TO.

56
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:30,383
THEY WANT SOMEONE
TO LISTEN TO THEM.

57
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,151
SINGLE GUYS ARE THE WORST.

58
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:35,321
THEY CAN'T GET IT AT HOME,
IS HOW THAT ONE GOES.

59
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:37,190
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO?

60
00:02:37,256 --> 00:02:40,059
INSTEAD OF HAVING
THE PHONE LINES REPAIRED,

61
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:41,828
YOU SHOULD HAVE THEM UPGRADED.

62
00:02:41,894 --> 00:02:43,162
GET CALL DISPLAY.

63
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,665
YOU COULD SEE THE NUMBER
OF THE PERSON

64
00:02:45,731 --> 00:02:47,767
THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK TO,

65
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,470
UNLESS THEY GOT
THAT DISPLAY BLOCK THING.

66
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:52,505
THEN YOU GOTTA GET INTERACTIVE

67
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:55,374
AND HAVE THEM FORWARDED
TO YOUR VOICE MAIL.

68
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:58,811
HAROLD, YOU HAVE ME CONFUSED
WITH A SUGGESTION BOX.

69
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:01,113
I'VE DIVIDED EVERY DAY
INTO HOURS,

70
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,784
AND EACH GUY GETS AN HOUR
TO DO ALL HIS COMMUNICATING.

71
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,286
I GOT 9:00 TO 10:00 P.M.
ON THURSDAY.

72
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,788
WHAT HOURS DO I GET?

73
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,289
AM I ON THERE?

74
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:14,293
YEAH, YOU HAVE 3:00
TO 4:00 A.M., TUESDAY MORNING.

75
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,364
DARN, IT'S THE SAME TIME SLOT
AS THIS SHOW.

76
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:22,802
(Red): BILL'S RADIO SHOW
IS GONNA FEATURE BOWLING.

77
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,303
STAY TUNED FOR THAT.

78
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,072
HE'S JUST PRACTISING RIGHT NOW.

79
00:03:26,138 --> 00:03:27,406
IT'S 10-PIN,

80
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,075
ISN'T IT, BILL?

81
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:31,410
OH, NO, IT'S TWO-PIN.

82
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:34,447
THAT IS NOT THE PEACE SIGN.

83
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:37,216
OKEY-DOKE, THIS IS THE BIG ONE!

84
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:40,953
FOR THE GRAND PRIZE
OF FREE HERBICIDE AND PESTICIDE

85
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,222
FROM MOIRA'S HOUSE
OF SKIN CARE,

86
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:46,492
YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO MAKE MR. HAMAR SAY...

87
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,160
THIS WORD.

88
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,266
THIRTY SECONDS -- BEGIN.

89
00:03:53,332 --> 00:03:55,768
ALL RIGHT, UH,
OBLIGATION.

90
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,270
PAROLE.

91
00:03:57,336 --> 00:04:00,106
NO, NO, YOUR JOB.

92
00:04:00,172 --> 00:04:01,607
(Sighing)

93
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,609
MANDATORY SUPERVISION.

94
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:07,513
NO, NO, WHEN SOMETHING
GOES WRONG, IT'S YOUR...

95
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,116
... REASON TO LEAVE TOWN
AND START A NEW LIFE?

96
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:13,686
UH, YOUR
BEHAVIOUR

97
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,187
IS YOUR..

98
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:16,689
DOWNFALL.

99
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,292
START A NEW APPROACH, HERE.

100
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,360
UM, YOUR WIFE

101
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,296
AND YOUR
CHILD ARE...

102
00:04:23,362 --> 00:04:24,931
IN ALBERTA.

103
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:26,265
(Audience laughing)

104
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:27,600
I THINK.

105
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,302
NO, NO, NO.

106
00:04:29,368 --> 00:04:31,304
ATLANTA?
NO, GEORGIA.

107
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,373
MIKE, LEGALLY, THEY ARE YOUR...

108
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,642
MONTHLY INSTALMENT.

109
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:39,312
ARE YOU CONCENTRATING
HERE, MIKE?

110
00:04:39,378 --> 00:04:41,480
I'M GIVING IT ALL I'VE GOT,
MR. GREEN.

111
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:42,748
REALLY? HOLY SMOKE.

112
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,283
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

113
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,851
SAY YOU'RE THE LEADER.

114
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,186
THEN YOU HAVE...

115
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,221
GUNS, GUARD DOGS...

116
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:52,658
YOU'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME,
UNCLE RED.

117
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,126
OK, MIKE, H-H-HOLD IT.

118
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:55,661
IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

119
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,029
AND YOU'RE TO BLAME,
YOU HAVE...

120
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,364
CULPABILITY.

121
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,533
IF IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME
IT HAPPENED, YOU HAVE...

122
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,501
CONVICTABILITY.

123
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,003
SO YOU WANT
TO AVOID...

124
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,504
RESPONSIBILITY!

125
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,773
(Ringing bell)

126
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,276
(Applause and cheering)

127
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:11,343
(Strums acoustic guitar)

128
00:05:11,343 --> 00:05:13,343
OH, GET YOUR
RODS OUT, BOYS

129
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,114
AND LET YOUR SINKERS FLY

130
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:16,449
SET YOUR HOOKS AND LURES

131
00:05:16,515 --> 00:05:17,950
BUT BE SURE
NOT TO CATCH THEM

132
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,285
IN ANY PART OF YOUR EYE

133
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:20,953
I KNOW WE'VE HAD OUR FUN

134
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,955
WITH CARDS AND JOKES
AND BEER

135
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,491
BUT IF I DON'T GO HOME
WITH AT LEAST ONE FISH

136
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,793
MY WIFE WON'T LET ME
COME BACK NEXT YEAR

137
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,662
THAT'S TRUE.

138
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,864
I'M SURE OUR C.B. RADIO THING

139
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,699
WILL WORK OUT ALL RIGHT,

140
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,801
BUT JUST IN CASE IT DOESN'T

141
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:38,804
AND WE MUST GO BACK
TO THE REGULAR PHONE SYSTEM,

142
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:42,642
I THOUGHT I'D SHOW YOU HOW YOU
CAN MAKE YOUR PHONE PROFITABLE.

143
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,745
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE
YOUR OWN PAY PHONE BOOTH.

144
00:05:45,811 --> 00:05:48,247
START OFF WITH
THE ONE PAY PHONE BOOTH,

145
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:51,617
AND AS YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL,
MAYBE GET A CHAIN OF THEM,

146
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,754
EVENTUALLY HAVE CANDICE BERGEN
DO YOUR T.V. ADS.

147
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,990
THE MAIN THING YOU NEED
IS A COIN-OPERATED DOOR,

148
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,426
LIKE THIS ONE
ON THIS NEWSPAPER BOX.

149
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:03,896
YOU COULD USE THE DOOR OFF
A PAY TOILET OR A BANK VAULT,

150
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,365
BUT THIS IS EASIER
TO THROW INTO THE VAN

151
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:07,767
WHEN NOBODY'S LOOKING.

152
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:11,871
FIRST YOU GOTTA GET THE BOLTS
OFF THE BOTTOM, THERE.

153
00:06:11,937 --> 00:06:14,073
THERE WE GO, AND SHE SHOULD

154
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,275
JUST POP RIGHT OFF,
I WOULD THINK.

155
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,277
(Grunting)

156
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,346
OH, FOR GOSH SAKES.

157
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:26,852
I HOPE THIS PROJECT'S WORTH
THE CASH INVESTMENT.

158
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,794
PICK A BUILDING THAT'S
THE RIGHT SIZE AND PERSONALITY

159
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,162
FOR A PHONE BOOTH.

160
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:38,597
THE BARN'S TOO BIG,
THE SHED ISN'T LOCKABLE.

161
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,299
THIS IS PERFECT.

162
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:45,237
ALL RIGHT, FIRST GET THE DOOR
OFF THE OUTHOUSE.

163
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:46,806
(Air horn blasting)

164
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:50,976
AMAZING HOW FAST THINGS RUST
AROUND AN OUTHOUSE.

165
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,079
I'M SURE THERE'S
A SCIENTIFIC THEORY,

166
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:54,747
BUT WE KNOW THE REAL REASON.

167
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,416
THE FIRST THING YOU GOTTA DO IS

168
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,953
TO ATTACH YOUR COIN-OPERATED
DOOR TO THE OUTHOUSE.

169
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,489
YOU COULD BOLT IT ON
OR WIRE 'ER ON,

170
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:06,759
BUT I PREFER TO USE SOMETHING
THAT WON'T RUST.

171
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,762
THE HANDYMAN'S SECRET WEAPON,
DUCT TAPE.

172
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:13,265
I'VE GOT THE PHONE MOUNTED
ON THE WALL IN THERE.

173
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:16,969
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS ADD
THE POSSUM LAKE PHONE BOOK

174
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,537
AND THE YELLOW PAGES.

175
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,272
ALL RIGHT, YELLOW PAGE.

176
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,441
ONCE THE PHONE SYSTEM
GETS GOING,

177
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,310
I'LL BE RAKING IN THE COIN.

178
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:27,680
THE BEAUTY OF USING AN OUTHOUSE
AS MY PHONE BOOTH IS

179
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,515
THERE'S A DUAL PURPOSE HERE.

180
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,650
YOU CAN ANSWER TWO CALLS
AT ONCE.

181
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,686
GOT AN EXTRA
BUSINESS LINE HERE.

182
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:37,156
AND EVEN THE NEWSPAPER
HAS MORE THAN ONE APPLICATION.

183
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,191
IF YOU GOT ONE
OF THEM TEENAGERS

184
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:41,260
WHO TIES UP THE PHONE
FOR HOURS,

185
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,229
HAVING THE PHONE
IN THE OUTHOUSE

186
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:46,232
WITH THE AROMA GOING
WILL NIP THAT IN THE BUD.

187
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:49,068
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

188
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,237
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

189
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:53,239
(Creaking)

190
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:54,740
FOR GOSH SAKES.

191
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,742
HAROLD, YOU GOT A QUARTER?

192
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,077
HAROLD?

193
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,411
HAROLD!

194
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:00,746
COME ON, HAROLD.

195
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,314
EMERGENCY CALL.

196
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:06,719
YOU WON'T WANT TO MISS
RANGER GORD'S INFOMERCIAL.

197
00:08:10,956 --> 00:08:13,926
WANT TO TALK ABOUT AN EVENING
WE'VE ALL GONE THROUGH.

198
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,494
HAD A QUIET DAY AT WORK.

199
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:18,330
YOU'VE HAD DINNER,
WATCHED SOME TELEVISION,

200
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,866
AND YOU CAN HARDLY
KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN.

201
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,369
YOU THINK ABOUT SLEEPING
ON THE COUCH,

202
00:08:23,435 --> 00:08:25,905
WHICH IS USUALLY
YOUR WIFE'S SUGGESTION.

203
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:29,408
YOU FIGURE, "NO, I'VE GOT
ENOUGH ENERGY TO GO TO BED.

204
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,510
"I WON'T PUT ON
ALL MY PYJAMAS."

205
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:34,513
THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM
WITH THIS PLAN.

206
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,515
IT'S ONLY 8:30.

207
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,017
(Audience laughing)

208
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,519
8:30, AND YOU CAN HARDLY
STAY AWAKE.

209
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:41,987
THAT IS PATHETIC.

210
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:45,791
IF YOU HAVE ANY HOPE
OF STAYING UP AFTER 9 O'CLOCK,

211
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,028
YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE A NAP
IN THE AFTERNOON.

212
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:50,596
THIS CAN BE INCONVENIENT

213
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,798
UNLESS YOU WORK
FOR THE GOVERNMENT,

214
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,701
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND
A WAY TO DO IT.

215
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:58,237
IN THE OLD DAYS,
YOU'D STAY UP ALL NIGHT

216
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,039
AND GO STRAIGHT IN TO WORK.

217
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:01,974
YOU'D SPEND A WEEKEND PARTYING

218
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,544
AND YOU'D NEVER LIE DOWN --
AT LEAST, NOT FOR SLEEPING.

219
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:06,946
THE SLEEP YOU NEED NOW

220
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:10,216
IS TO MAKE UP FOR THE REST
YOU DIDN'T GET BACK THEN.

221
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:11,784
SO RELAX AND HAVE A NAP.

222
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,752
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

223
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:15,554
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

224
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:18,891
(Applause)

225
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,627
OH, MAN, CAN'T TAKE
ANY MORE OF THAT.

226
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,662
"THE BUSTER HADFIELD HOUR".

227
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,931
SIXTY MINUTES OF ZITHER MUSIC.

228
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:29,268
YOU'D HAVE TO BE AN IDIOT
TO LISTEN TO THAT.

229
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,703
(Zither music playing)

230
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,541
WHAT? WHAT?

231
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,076
AFTER THE FIRST WEEK,

232
00:09:37,142 --> 00:09:41,013
THE GUYS HAD PRETTY WELL SAID
EVERYTHING THEY COULD THINK OF.

233
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,781
A LOT KEPT TALKING ANYWAY.

234
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:45,684
OTHERS SWITCHED
TO DIFFERENT KINDS OF MUSIC.

235
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,554
SOME STARTED GETTING GUESTS
ON THEIR SHOWS.

236
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,656
I GOT GUESTS ON MY SHOWS.

237
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:54,860
I GOT KATHIE LEE GIFFORD
AND I GOT G. GORDON LIDDY.

238
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,629
THE TOPIC IS HOBBIES.

239
00:09:56,695 --> 00:09:58,697
YOU GOT THEM FOR SURE?

240
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,333
NO, I LEFT AN E-MAIL MESSAGE
ON THE INTERNET.

241
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,535
I'M HOPING SOMEONE
RELAYS IT TO THEM.

242
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:05,237
I UNDERSTAND REGIS IS WIRED.

243
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:06,672
(Audience laughing)

244
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:10,609
ANYWAY, OUR PHONE SYSTEM
HAS TURNED INTO A RADIO STATION

245
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:14,480
WITH THE WORST PROGRAMMES
YOU EVER HEARD IN YOUR LIFE.

246
00:10:14,546 --> 00:10:17,616
MOOSE THOMPSON'S SHOW IS
"WHAT I ATE TODAY".

247
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,619
"STINKY PETERSON,
UP CLOSE AND HAZARDOUS."

248
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:23,555
"THE OLD MAN SEDGWICK
INSPIRATIONAL HOUR."

249
00:10:23,622 --> 00:10:24,990
I HEARD THAT ONE.

250
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:29,061
DOES HE SPEAK LATIN
OR DID HE HAVE HIS TEETH OUT?

251
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,596
I DON'T MIND COMPETITION,

252
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,132
BUT THESE GUYS ARE TAKING IT
SO SERIOUSLY.

253
00:10:33,198 --> 00:10:34,867
THERE'S ONE WAY TO FIX IT.

254
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,536
YOU COULD HAVE THE PHONE
SYSTEMS REPAIRED

255
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,204
AND CANCEL ALL THE SHOWS.

256
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:41,307
NO, NOT ALL THE SHOWS, HAROLD.

257
00:10:41,373 --> 00:10:44,643
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE
A SENSE OF THE RATINGS,

258
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,445
BUT I OWN THURSDAY NIGHT.

259
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:49,081
"RED'S E-Z LISTENING
HARMONICA HOUSE."

260
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,885
(Audience laughing)

261
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:56,088
HEY, BUZZ SHERWOOD
WITH SAFETY FIRST!

262
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,591
(Shouting)

263
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:01,093
... RINGING THE BELLS!

264
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,095
DON'T YOU WORRY, NO WAY!

265
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,097
THERE WILL BE
BLOOD EVERYWHERE!

266
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:08,100
SO, POINT IS, HOLD THE GUN,
SHOOT IT...

267
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,602
(Shouting)

268
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:13,005
OK!

269
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:14,340
HI, GORD.

270
00:11:14,406 --> 00:11:15,674
OH, HI, RED.

271
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:18,944
I'D LOVE TO TALK,
BUT IT IS 50 CENTS.

272
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,613
WHAT THE HECK
YOU GOT GOING ON HERE?

273
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,350
WITH THE BUDGET CUTS
AT THE FORESTRY DEPARTMENT,

274
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,019
I'M HELPING THEM BRIDGE
THE FINANCIAL CRUNCH.

275
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,989
THEY HAVEN'T SENT ME
A PAYCHEQUE IN OVER A DECADE.

276
00:11:30,055 --> 00:11:31,557
THAT'S A HUGE FUNDING GAP.

277
00:11:31,623 --> 00:11:34,259
THAT WOULD BE
A COMMUNICATION GAP.

278
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:37,062
WHAT DO I GET FOR 50 CENTS,
ANYWAY?

279
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,198
WELL, GENERAL INFORMATION,
MOSTLY,

280
00:11:39,264 --> 00:11:42,167
BUT ALSO FIRE DANGER REPORTS,
WEATHER REPORTS,

281
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,403
AND A BEAUTIFUL,
BREATH-TAKING VIEW

282
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,572
FROM HIGH ATOP
FIRE WATCH-TOWER 13.

283
00:11:46,638 --> 00:11:48,073
ALL RIGHT, I'LL BITE.

284
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,575
YOU GOT 50 CENTS, HAROLD?

285
00:11:49,641 --> 00:11:51,076
COME ON.

286
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,578
THERE WE GO.

287
00:11:52,644 --> 00:11:54,079
GREAT.

288
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,081
AND 50 CENTS FOR HAROLD.

289
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:57,583
COME ON, HAROLD.

290
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:59,084
HAVEN'T GOT IT.

291
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,587
SORRY, HAROLD,
CAN'T USE THE STAIRS.

292
00:12:01,653 --> 00:12:02,921
GO UP THE OUTSIDE.

293
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,256
YOU'LL BE FINE.

294
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,591
WOW!

295
00:12:05,657 --> 00:12:07,826
YOU'RE MY FIRST CUSTOMER
TODAY, RED.

296
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,962
GORD, I'M
YOUR ONLY CUSTOMER EVER.

297
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,631
I COULD PROBABLY GET
QUITE A FEW TOURISTS.

298
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,700
PEOPLE LOVE TO CLIMB
HIGH TOWERS.

299
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,702
LOOK AT
THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT,

300
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:19,104
THE EIFFEL TOWER,
STATUE OF LIBERTY...

301
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,773
OR THE C.N. TOWER IN TORONTO.

302
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:22,608
THERE'S A TOWER IN TORONTO?

303
00:12:22,674 --> 00:12:23,876
OH, YEAH.

304
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:27,046
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
THEY'LL HAVE A BASEBALL TEAM.

305
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:29,615
WELL, THEY DID FOR A WHILE.

306
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,053
(Whistling)

307
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:35,387
OH, HAROLD, FINALLY!

308
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:36,722
WELCOME.

309
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,557
THANKS FOR DROPPING IN, HAROLD.

310
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,059
WHAT NOW, RANGER GORD?

311
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:43,395
WELL, FIRST, THE FIRE
SAFETY REPORT -- IT'S LOW.

312
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:46,565
NEXT, THE WEATHER REPORT --
IT'S FINE, GREAT.

313
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,068
SOUVENIR SHOP IS OPEN.

314
00:12:49,134 --> 00:12:50,569
RANGER GORD DOLL...

315
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,071
OH, BOY, WHAT'S THAT?

316
00:12:52,137 --> 00:12:53,572
THAT'S MY TOWER.

317
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,907
HOLY SMOKE.

318
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:57,076
NOTHING FOR ME, THANKS, GORD.

319
00:12:57,142 --> 00:12:58,510
I'LL GIVE A SHORT TALK

320
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:00,879
ON THE HISTORY
OF FIRE WATCH-TOWER 13.

321
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,749
OH, MAN, NO, I'VE ALREADY HAD
MY 50 CENTS' WORTH.

322
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,084
THANK YOU, GORD.

323
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,920
OH, OK, GREAT.

324
00:13:07,986 --> 00:13:10,589
(Coins rattling)

325
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:14,593
IT'S THE EASIEST MONEY
I
 EVER MADE.

326
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,263
IT'S THE ONLY MONEY
I EVER MADE.

327
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,598
ATTENTION, HANDYMEN.

328
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:21,900
IF A PIECE OF METAL'S TOO LONG,

329
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,369
YOU CAN SHORTEN IT
WITH TIN SNIPS.

330
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:32,111
REMEMBER, ANY TOOL
CAN BE THE RIGHT TOOL.

331
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,915
MAN!

332
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,051
(Laughing)

333
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,486
WHAT IS IT WITH PEOPLE?

334
00:13:40,552 --> 00:13:43,522
C.B. WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A FUN WAY TO COMMUNICATE.

335
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,991
SOMEBODY FIGURES OUT
A WAY TO MAKE MONEY

336
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:48,794
AND EVERYBODY STARTS
TAKING IT TOO SERIOUSLY.

337
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,629
NO MATTER WHAT IT IS IN LIFE,

338
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:53,432
WHEN MONEY'S INVOLVED,
IT'S NOT FUN ANY MORE.

339
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:57,035
EASY FOR YOU TO SAY --
YOU'RE MARRIED.

340
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:58,537
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS

341
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,706
BUT MAKE SURE
I'M OUT OF THE BUILDING

342
00:14:00,772 --> 00:14:02,074
BEFORE YOU PLUG IT IN.

343
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,542
IT'S A SIGNAL BOOSTER.

344
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,478
I'M MAKING IT OUT OF
MY OLD "CLOSE AND PLAY".

345
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:10,516
IT'S GONNA INCREASE THE REACH
OF "HAROLD'S HIP-HOP SOCK HOP".

346
00:14:10,582 --> 00:14:12,818
THAT'S GONNA MAKE
MY SPONSOR HAPPY.

347
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,187
YOU GOT A SPONSOR?
WHAT? ACNE CREAM?

348
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,022
NO, NO, STODGY'S PICKLES --

349
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,424
THE OLD-FASHIONED-EXPERIENCE
PICKLE.

350
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:21,560
THE PICKLE
THAT KEEPS ON GIVING.

351
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,462
EVERYBODY'S TAKING IT
SO SERIOUSLY,

352
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,330
GETTING GUESTS,
GETTING SPONSORS.

353
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,566
THE GUESTS WANT BUS FARE
AND DOUGHNUTS.

354
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,401
THEN THEY NEED
BIGGER AUDIENCES.

355
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,737
THEY'RE STARTING
TO WELD LADDERS TOGETHER

356
00:14:31,803 --> 00:14:33,438
SO THEY GOT A BIGGER ANTENNA.

357
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:36,542
THEY'RE PUTTING CLOTHESLINES
WITH STOVE WIRES ON THEM.

358
00:14:36,608 --> 00:14:38,544
IT'S GETTING TO BE A REAL PAIN.

359
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,013
HAVE YOU SEEN
JIMMY GRISSLE'S SHOW?

360
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:44,583
IT'S CALLED "SHOCK RADIO",
AND IT'S SHOCKING, TOO.

361
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:48,921
IT'S WORSE THAN THE NAMES
KIDS CALL ME ON THE SCHOOL BUS.

362
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:50,689
YOU BEEN EATING
TOO MANY PICKLES.

363
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:53,292
NOT JUST ANY PICKLES --
STODGY'S PICKLES.

364
00:14:53,358 --> 00:14:55,027
PICKLES GROWN IN THE SHADE

365
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:58,063
FOR A GREENER GREEN
AND A MORE NATURAL FLAVOUR.

366
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,464
NOW, THERE'S A SLOGAN.

367
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:02,367
STODGY'S PICKLES, FOR PEOPLE
WHO WANT A PICKLE

368
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,136
WHERE THE SUN DON'T SHINE.

369
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,039
HI, RANGER GORD HERE.

370
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:09,208
MAIL SERVICE HERE IS NOT GREAT.

371
00:15:09,274 --> 00:15:11,376
IN THE 16 YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE,

372
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:13,612
I HAVEN'T RECEIVED
ONE PAYCHEQUE.

373
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,215
MOM, NONE OF YOUR LETTERS
GOT THROUGH.

374
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:18,884
RED HAS ALLOWED ME
TO USE THIS AIR TIME

375
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,086
TO SEND YOU A PERSONAL MESSAGE.

376
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:22,921
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

377
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:27,125
MOM, SINCE I LEFT,
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ON MY MIND,

378
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:28,794
BUT I NEVER ASKED.

379
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,230
DID I LEAVE THE KETTLE ON?

380
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:33,665
(Red): AS I TRIED TO WARN YOU,

381
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:37,536
BILL HAD DECIDED TO DEDICATE
HIS RADIO PROGRAMME

382
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,870
TO... BOWLING.

383
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:41,673
NOT REALLY THE IDEAL GAME,
I WOULD THINK,

384
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,242
TO PLAY ON THE RADIO,

385
00:15:43,308 --> 00:15:47,045
BUT THEN AGAIN, I'M NOT BILL,
AND I'M THANKFUL FOR THAT.

386
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,981
YEAH, HE'S BROADCASTING LIVE

387
00:15:49,047 --> 00:15:51,149
FROM THE BACK
OF POSSUM LODGE...

388
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:54,052
AS LIVE AS HE GETS,
WHICH IS WAY TOO LIVE.

389
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,420
I MADE A FEW COMMENTS,

390
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:58,123
CHARACTER ASSASSINATION,
THAT TYPE OF THING.

391
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,558
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

392
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,893
HE'S GONNA SET UP THE PINS.

393
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,962
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A BOWLING GAME.

394
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,631
I HAD HIS RADIO FOR HIM.

395
00:16:05,697 --> 00:16:07,566
VARIOUS WEIGHTS OF THE BALLS.

396
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,334
THERE'S A VERY LIGHT ONE.

397
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,737
ANYWAY, YOU GOT
SOME FIVE-PIN BALLS

398
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:13,572
MIXED IN WITH THOSE, BILL.

399
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,073
THAT'S A 10-PIN BALL.

400
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,075
WHY DON'T YOU PUT THAT DOWN?

401
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,577
OH, BOY.

402
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,078
OH, BOY.

403
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,080
YOU WANT TO SIT DOWN--

404
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,182
YOU WANT TO STAY WELL BACK.

405
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:25,751
YOU THREW THAT STRAIGHT UP.

406
00:16:25,817 --> 00:16:27,219
IT WILL BE BACK SOON.

407
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,854
OH, MY.

408
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,123
OUCH! OHHH!

409
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:32,524
THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.

410
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:35,594
WE BROKE HIS RADIO,
SO WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS.

411
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,029
I'LL GET THAT, BILL.

412
00:16:37,095 --> 00:16:38,530
OH, BOY, OH, BOY!

413
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:42,467
SITTING OUT IN THE SUN,
THE BLACK BALLS ABSORB HEAT.

414
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,203
THE BALLS ALMOST CHANGE
THEIR FORM.

415
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,139
GOT KIND OF SPONGY ON US

416
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:48,674
AND...

417
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,008
OH MY GOSH.

418
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:51,343
BIG CLEAN-UP JOB?

419
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,679
OH, JUST WIPE THAT...
NEVER MIND.

420
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:57,516
ALL RIGHT, WE CREATED
SOME SHADE WITH A LAWN CHAIR.

421
00:16:57,582 --> 00:16:59,151
BILL GRABS A 10-PIN BALL.

422
00:16:59,217 --> 00:17:02,921
THE THING WITH BOWLING, SOME
PEOPLE FEEL THEY HAVE TO CHEAT.

423
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,057
WHAT ABOUT THE FOUL--
BILL, THE FOUL--

424
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:06,558
WE HAVEN'T GOT A FOUL LINE.

425
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,893
THAT'S CHEATING.

426
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:09,661
YOU GOTTA PUT SOMETHING--

427
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,531
GRAB THE PITCHFORK,
GRAB THE PITCHFORK.

428
00:17:12,597 --> 00:17:14,766
NOW YOU JUST DON'T GO BY THAT.

429
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,569
BILL THOUGHT
THAT'S WAY TOO DANGEROUS.

430
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:18,904
OH!

431
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,806
HE THOUGHT HE WOULD MAYBE

432
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:23,942
TAKE THE DANGEROUS PART
OFF THE PITCHFORK.

433
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,712
THAT'S CALLED THE TINES,
SO HE WAS...

434
00:17:26,778 --> 00:17:30,415
IF YOU HAD SOME LINE-DANCE
MUSIC GOING RIGHT NOW,

435
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,151
YOU'D SWEAR
YOU WERE WATCHING T.N.N.

436
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,520
HE'S TRYING TO GET
THE HANDLE OFF,

437
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:37,122
AND THERE SHE GOES.

438
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,324
OH, HERE COMES
THE HANDLE -- OW!

439
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,094
I CAN CARRY THE FLAG
IN THE PARADE NOW.

440
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,696
ALL RIGHT, SO THERE'S OUR LINE.

441
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:47,833
I DON'T KNOW --
I THINK 10-PIN IS JUST

442
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:49,434
TOO RIGOUROUS FOR ME.

443
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,536
THE PINS ARE TOO FAR AWAY.

444
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,472
BILL, LOTS OF JUICE.

445
00:17:53,538 --> 00:17:55,107
LET 'ER GO!

446
00:17:55,173 --> 00:17:56,441
OH! OH! OH!

447
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,210
HEAD DOWN THE RAVINE...

448
00:17:58,276 --> 00:17:59,544
I GUESS-- UH-OH!

449
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:00,879
STINKY'S CAR!

450
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:02,214
MAN! MAN!

451
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,915
TOUGH TO EXPLAIN.

452
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:06,118
LET'S COUNT OUR SCORE.

453
00:18:06,184 --> 00:18:10,555
BILL, YOU'VE GOT --
LET'S SEE -- TWO STRIKES.

454
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,691
I GOT A SPARE.

455
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,060
STAY TUNED
TO SEE HAROLD LISTENING

456
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,795
TO HIS SONY "DORK-MAN".

457
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,768
GARTH HARBLE HERE,
ANIMAL CONTROL,

458
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:25,170
WITH ANOTHER FEATURE
ON ANIMALS IN YOUR LIFE.

459
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,505
COME ON IN, RED.

460
00:18:26,571 --> 00:18:27,839
WHERE DID YOU GET THE HAND?

461
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,174
MIME SCHOOL?

462
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:32,544
I WAS PULLING RATS
OUT OF A BASEMENT SEWER TRAP.

463
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,212
MY WATCH BAND CAME OFF.

464
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,348
RATS REALLY LIKE SHINY THINGS.

465
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,184
I HAD TO GIVE ONE A BITE
TO GET IT BACK.

466
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,052
THAT SOUNDS AWFUL DANGEROUS.

467
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:43,522
NO, JUST ANOTHER SUPER DAY
ON THE JOB.

468
00:18:43,588 --> 00:18:47,426
FOR YOU KIDS WHO MAY BE GOING
TO COLLEGE, HERE'S AN EXAMPLE

469
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:50,195
OF WHAT A FINE ARTS DEGREE
CAN DO FOR YOU.

470
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,530
GOT AN ANIMAL FEATURE?

471
00:18:51,596 --> 00:18:52,864
HUH?

472
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,199
ANIMAL FEATURE?

473
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,534
OH, OH, OH, YES.

474
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,868
GEESE, CANADA GEESE.

475
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,203
SURE.

476
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,772
MAGNIFICENT BIRD,
BEAUTIFUL FLYER,

477
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,408
BUT BOY, THEY GOT
A LARGE INTESTINE

478
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,210
LIKE A SAUSAGE MACHINE.

479
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:08,013
I GOTTA GET A PACK OF THEM
OUT OF POSSUM PARK.

480
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,216
EVERYBODY'S COMPLAINING
ABOUT THE GEESE IN THE PARK.

481
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:14,219
ABOUT EATING THE GRASS
AND DROPPINGS AND WHATNOT?

482
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:17,789
MORE THAT THE MEAT IS SO TOUGH
AND REAL GREASY.

483
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,225
IT'S SOMETIMES HARD TO SWALLOW.

484
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,227
I'M GONNA FORGET I HEARD THAT.

485
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:23,728
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

486
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,063
GIVE ME A HAND.

487
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,398
ALL RIGHT.

488
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,234
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THE GEESE?

489
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,503
I'M TAKING 'EM
TO MY BOSS'S HOUSE.

490
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,638
HE AND HIS WIFE
ARE ON VACATION.

491
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,740
HE ORDERED ME TO CUT HIS GRASS.

492
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,242
THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.

493
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,743
THEY'RE FILTHY ANIMALS,
YOU KNOW.

494
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:42,814
OH, I KNOW, RED,
BUT SO ARE THE GEESE.

495
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,818
(Applause and cheering)

496
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,753
IT'S "MALE CALL"!

497
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,755
(Applause)

498
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:53,258
ALL RIGHT.

499
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:56,761
I GOT... I GOT THE LETTER
TODAY AND...

500
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,763
OH! OH! OH!

501
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,265
GOT SOME PICTURES, HAROLD.

502
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,933
YOU TAKE THE LETTER.

503
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,171
ALWAYS LOVE IT WHEN PEOPLE SEND
PICTURES OF THEIR CAMPING TRIPS

504
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,740
OR FISHING TRIPS
OR HANDYMAN PROJECTS.

505
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:12,210
IT MAKES US FEEL BETTER
ABOUT THE STUFF WE MESS UP.

506
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:14,212
WELL, ALL RIGHTY, APPARENTLY--

507
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,981
NO, NO, NO, LET ME GUESS.

508
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:17,849
NOT THE GREATEST PICTURES.

509
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,618
LOOKS LIKE A WILD ANIMAL.

510
00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:22,220
COULD BE A SEA CREATURE
OF SOME KIND.

511
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,788
"DEAR RED, HERE ARE PICTURES

512
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:26,224
"OF MY WIFE GIVING BIRTH
TO OUR DAUGHTER."

513
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,559
OH MY GOSH!

514
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:28,894
I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT!

515
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,228
WHAT?

516
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:31,563
OHHHHH!

517
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,231
TAKE A LOOK!

518
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,233
NO! NO!

519
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,736
THAT'S A... BIRTH IS BEAUTIFUL.

520
00:20:37,802 --> 00:20:39,738
OHHH! OH! OH! OH! OH!

521
00:20:39,804 --> 00:20:41,239
LOOK AT THAT!

522
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:42,741
OH! OH! OH! OH!

523
00:20:42,807 --> 00:20:44,075
(Laughing)

524
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,745
WHOA!

525
00:20:46,811 --> 00:20:48,747
BOY, OH BOY, LOOK AT THAT!

526
00:20:48,813 --> 00:20:50,382
OHHH!

527
00:20:50,448 --> 00:20:53,251
GARTH HARBLE HERE,
ANIMAL CONTROL,

528
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:56,521
REMINDING YOU THAT THE BEST WAY
TO SPOT ANIMALS

529
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,090
IS BY STUDYING
THE TRACKS THEY LEAVE.

530
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:01,259
THE WORST WAY IS BY...

531
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:04,095
STUDYING THEIR... BITE MARKS.

532
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,934
(Static on radio)

533
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,570
WELL, THE POSSUM LODGE
RADIO STATION

534
00:21:11,636 --> 00:21:15,473
IS OFFICIALLY OFF THE AIR
AS OF MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT.

535
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,208
WHAT ARE YOU LISTENING TO,
HAROLD?

536
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:18,810
NOTHING.

537
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:21,913
I KNOW -- POSSUM RADIO NETWORK
SHUT DOWN.

538
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,449
OH, OK.

539
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:28,286
HOW LONG WERE YOU GONNA LISTEN
TO DEAD AIR, HAROLD?

540
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,789
HOW LONG WERE YOU GONNA TALK?

541
00:21:30,855 --> 00:21:33,558
(Audience laughing)

542
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:37,028
(Applause and cheering)

543
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:39,531
NOT EASY WHEN YOU GOT HIM
ON ONE SIDE

544
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,666
AND THE GOVERNMENT
ON THE OTHER.

545
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,202
THAT'S WHAT KILLED
THE RADIO STATION.

546
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,071
I BUILT A HUGE TRANSMITTER.

547
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:49,841
I DUCT-TAPED BAGS OF CHRISTMAS
TINSEL TO A DOUGLAS FIR.

548
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:52,077
WAS I GETTING A SIGNAL
OUT THERE.

549
00:21:52,143 --> 00:21:54,846
I WAS GETTING CALLS
FROM TIBET, TIMBUCTU,

550
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:56,748
AND, UNFORTUNATELY, OTTAWA.

551
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,617
THE GOVERNMENT WANTED TO KNOW

552
00:21:58,683 --> 00:22:00,719
IF I HAD
A BROADCASTER'S LICENCE.

553
00:22:00,785 --> 00:22:02,754
I SAID I GOT
A LEARNER'S PERMIT.

554
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,456
WE SHOULD GET
A LICENCE.

555
00:22:04,522 --> 00:22:06,691
WE COULD HAVE
OUR OWN STATION.

556
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,360
I DON'T WANT THE GOVERNMENT

557
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:09,861
IN MY LIFE.

558
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:13,131
I DON'T NEED ANYBODY ELSE
TELLING ME WHAT TO DO.

559
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:14,666
OK, FORGET THAT, THEN.

560
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,167
WE SHOULD GET

561
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:17,535
A TELEVISION
STATION.

562
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:18,870
I WANT TO HAVE FUN.

563
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,205
I DON'T CALL TELEVISION FUN.

564
00:22:20,271 --> 00:22:21,539
YOU DON'T
CALL THIS FUN?

565
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,208
I DON'T CALL THIS TELEVISION.

566
00:22:23,274 --> 00:22:24,542
(Possum squeal)

567
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:25,877
IT'S MEETING
TIME.

568
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,212
YOU GO AHEAD, HAROLD.

569
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:28,613
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

570
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,948
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

571
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,883
I'M COMING HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

572
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,252
NOW THAT I'M NOT
IN THE RADIO BUSINESS --

573
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,488
I'M NO LONGER KING
OF THURSDAY NIGHT --

574
00:22:36,554 --> 00:22:39,724
MAYBE I CAN GO BACK TO BEING
PRINCE OF SATURDAY MORNING.

575
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:42,627
FOR THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

576
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,764
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND HAROLD AND THE GANG,

577
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,732
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

578
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,235
(Applause and cheering)

579
00:22:50,301 --> 00:22:52,237
(Whistling)

580
00:22:52,303 --> 00:22:54,739
(Applause)

581
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:56,241
(Possum squeal)

582
00:22:56,307 --> 00:22:58,309
(Harold): ALL RISE.

583
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:04,182
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

584
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:06,084
(Harold): THERE YOU GO.

585
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:08,186
ANYONE DRIVING A 1986 CAR

586
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:09,688
OR NEWER,

587
00:23:09,754 --> 00:23:11,523
RAISE BOTH HANDS LIKE THAT.
