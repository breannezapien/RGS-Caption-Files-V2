WATERING THE LAWN

EVERYTHING NEATLY AWAY

HANDYMAN CORNER,

156
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:26,311
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU HOW
TO TURN YOUR CENTRAL VAC

157
00:07:26,311 --> 00:07:30,115
INTO AN IN-HOUSE, TWO-WAY
MESSAGE DELIVERY SYSTEM.

158
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:32,551
FIRST THING YOU WANNA DO IS
RE-WIRE THE RECEPTACLE

159
00:07:32,551 --> 00:07:34,986
SO THAT IT'S CONTROLLED
BY THIS WALL SWITCH.

160
00:07:34,986 --> 00:07:37,756
LIKE THIS...

161
00:07:41,693 --> 00:07:44,362
SO THAT'S WHERE THEY GO.

162
00:07:46,064 --> 00:07:48,266
NEXT YOU NEED A
COUPLE OF MAILBOXES.

163
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:49,835
YOU CAN ACTUALLY
GET THESE CHEAP,

164
00:07:49,835 --> 00:07:53,238
AS LONG AS IT'S DARK AND
YOU'VE GOT A STRONG
FRONT BUMPER.

165
00:07:53,238 --> 00:07:55,607
THESE ARE GOING TO
BECOME OUR MESSAGE CENTRES.

166
00:07:55,607 --> 00:07:58,376
TO HOOK THE UNIT UP TO THE
CENTRAL VAC SYSTEM,

167
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:02,013
YOU NEED SOME PVC PIPE
AND A COUPLE OF ELBOWS.

168
00:08:02,013 --> 00:08:04,049
AND THAT WAY ANYTHING THAT'S
TRAVELING THROUGH THE SYSTEM

169
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:07,118
WILL BE DEFLECTED
INTO THE MAILBOX.

170
00:08:07,118 --> 00:08:09,788
NOW, SENDING MESSAGES, WELL,
THAT'S A LITTLE TRICKIER,

171
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:12,791
BECAUSE YOU NEED SOMETHING THAT
WILL FUNNEL EVERYTHING
INTO THE PIPE.

172
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:16,194
I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO USE
PIECES OFF THESE HIGHWAY
SAFETY CONES.

173
00:08:16,194 --> 00:08:19,831
YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET THESE
WHILE YOU'RE GETTING
THE MAILBOXES.

174
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:24,736
YOU NEED TO GET
TWO OF THESE UNITS

175
00:08:24,736 --> 00:08:26,504
SO THAT YOU AND YOUR WIFE
CAN EACH HAVE ONE, SEE,

176
00:08:26,504 --> 00:08:28,340
AND THEN WHEREVER
YOU ARE IN THE HOUSE

177
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,475
YOU JUST PLUG IT INTO THE
NEAREST CENTRAL VAC OUTLET.

178
00:08:30,475 --> 00:08:33,578
THE ONLY OTHER DETAIL IS
CONTROLLING THE AIRFLOW.

179
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:35,780
SEE, I PUNCHED A HOLE IN
THE SIDE OF THE MAILBOX,

180
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,817
AND IN THE RECEIVE POSITION,
THE HOLE IS COVERED

181
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:41,152
BY THIS PLUG THAT
I TOOK OUR OF OUR BATHTUB.

182
00:08:41,152 --> 00:08:43,121
IT MEANS BERNICE AND I
CAN ONLY TAKE SHOWERS NOW,

183
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:44,723
BUT THAT'S FINE.

184
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:46,725
I MEAN, THE TWO OF US
HAVING A BATH TOGETHER

185
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:49,027
LOOKS LIKE THE MANATEE
EXHIBIT AT MARINELAND.

186
00:08:49,027 --> 00:08:51,496
BUT RIGHT NOW I WANNA SEND
BERNICE A MESSAGE.

187
00:08:51,496 --> 00:08:53,765
SO WHAT I DO IS
I MOVE MY DISPATCH ARM

188
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:55,934
INTO THE SEND POSITION.

189
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:58,236
THAT MOVES THE BATHTUB
PLUG AWAY FROM THE HOLE

190
00:08:58,236 --> 00:09:00,505
AND ALLOWS AIR TO FLOW
INTO THE SYSTEM,

191
00:09:00,505 --> 00:09:02,607
BECAUSE AIR IS KINDA
LIKE A MARRIED MAN...

192
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:05,577
IT'LL ALWAYS TAKE THE
PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE.

193
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:08,246
OKAY, BERNICE IS UPSTAIRS
IN THE HOUSE SOMEWHERE.

194
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:10,782
I'M JUST GONNA SEND HER
THIS LITTLE MESSAGE.

195
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:28,199
NOW I JUST SWING THE ARM DOWN
INTO THE RECEIVE POSITION.

196
00:09:32,604 --> 00:09:34,272
THERE WE GO.

197
00:09:35,874 --> 00:09:37,742
WONDER WHAT SHE SAID?

198
00:09:47,118 --> 00:09:50,221
[ APPLAUSE ]

199
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:01,199
I THINK I FIGURED OUT
THE EXACT MOMENT

200
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:04,669
WHEN MEN STARTED
TO GO HORRIBLY OFF TRACK.

201
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:06,671
IT WASN'T THE
FIRST SUPERBOWL

202
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:09,574
OR A VILLAGE PEOPLE CONCERT

203
00:10:09,574 --> 00:10:11,776
OR WHEN THEY INTRODUCED
BOTTOMLESS DRINKS

204
00:10:11,776 --> 00:10:14,479
AT THE TOPLESS BAR.

205
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:19,417
IT WAS THE DAY SOMEBODY
INVENTED AUTOMATIC
TRANSMISSION.

206
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:21,419
THAT CHANGED US FOREVER.

207
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:23,922
SUDDENLY DRIVING
A CAR WAS EASY.

208
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:25,990
THAT'S A BAD THING.

209
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,092
MEN ONLY LIKE TWO
THINGS TO BE EASY...

210
00:10:28,092 --> 00:10:31,095
EXAMS AND WOMEN.

211
00:10:31,095 --> 00:10:34,432
AND WE DON'T STUDY
FOR EITHER ONE OF THEM.

212
00:10:34,432 --> 00:10:37,068
DRIVING NEEDS
TO BE DIFFICULT,

213
00:10:37,068 --> 00:10:38,970
BECAUSE IF A MAN
IS DOING SOMETHING

214
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,039
THAT DOESN'T TAKE
BOTH HANDS AND BOTH FEET,

215
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,976
HIS MIND WILL WANDER, AND IT
DOESN'T STOP AND ASK
FOR DIRECTIONS.

216
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:49,080
AND IF YOU ASK ME,
WOMEN WOULD PREFER
TO DATE A GUY

217
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,915
WHO HAS STANDARD
TRANSMISSION,

218
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:52,717
'CAUSE IF HE'S A YOUNG MAN,

219
00:10:52,717 --> 00:10:54,686
YOU KNOW HE'S GOTTA KEEP
HIS HANDS TO HIMSELF;

220
00:10:54,686 --> 00:10:56,521
AND IF HE'S AN OLD GUY,

221
00:10:56,521 --> 00:10:59,524
THERE'S LESS CHANCE THAT
HIS LEG WILL FALL ASLEEP.

222
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:01,326
SO THE NEXT TIME
YOU BUY A CAR,

223
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:03,728
GET ONE WITH A CLUTCH
AND A GEAR SHIFT.

224
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:05,630
LET'S GET BACK TO THE DAYS

225
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,132
WHEN OUR CAREERS WERE MOVING
FORWARD AND OUR CARS
WERE STALLING,

226
00:11:08,132 --> 00:11:10,568
RATHER THAN
THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

227
00:11:10,568 --> 00:11:12,136
REMEMBER I'M
PULLING FOR YOU.

228
00:11:12,136 --> 00:11:15,339
WE'RE ALL
IN THIS TOGETHER.

229
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:20,678
EVEN IF YOU'VE BEEN LIVING
A THREE-PLY LIFESTYLE

230
00:11:20,678 --> 00:11:22,580
ON A TWO-PLY BUDGET,

231
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,582
DON'T SKIMP ON YOUR
SEPTIC MAINTENANCE.

232
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:26,818
THAT'S ONE PLACE
YOU DON'T WANNA BE

233
00:11:26,818 --> 00:11:29,353
OVER YOUR HEAD.

234
00:11:33,157 --> 00:11:34,959
WELL, I GOT A
CHAIN LETTER FROM HAROLD,

235
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,427
WHICH IS NOT
A BIG SURPRISE,

236
00:11:36,427 --> 00:11:37,962
BUT HEY, WAIT A MINUTE,
WHAT'S THIS?

237
00:11:37,962 --> 00:11:40,731
A CHAIN LETTER
FROM WINSTON, HUH?

238
00:11:40,731 --> 00:11:44,068
I AM HAVING A SPECIAL
KIND OF DAY, AREN'T I?

239
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:46,537
HEY, RED,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

240
00:11:46,537 --> 00:11:49,106
WELL, YOU DON'T THROW
CHAIN LETTERS IN
THE GARBAGE!

OH, NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

242
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,085
YOU KNOW, I EXPECTED A CHAIN
LETTER FROM HAROLD,

243
00:12:01,085 --> 00:12:02,620
BUT NOT FROM YOU, WINSTON.

244
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,655
LOOK, RED, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO SEND CHAIN LETTERS

245
00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:06,224
TO 10 PEOPLE YOU KNOW.

246
00:12:06,224 --> 00:12:09,527
IN A TOWN THIS SIZE,
YOU'RE BOUND TO GET
SOME OVERLAP.

247
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:11,295
YEAH, WELL,
YOU KNOW, WINSTON,

248
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:13,664
I DON'T MIND YOU GETTIN'
INVOLVED IN THIS CHAIN
LETTER THING,

249
00:12:13,664 --> 00:12:16,334
OH, I SENSE A BIG
"BUT" COMING HERE.

I'D FIND YOU TWO HERE.

252

CHAIN LETTER HERE

STAMP A LOT CHEAPER

ALL THE WAY OVER HERE?

256
00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:33,417
YEAH, BUT IT'S
NOT AS FAST.

257
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:36,887
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S NOT ALWAYS
ABOUT MONEY, RED.

258
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:39,890
YOU KNOW, RED'S TOTALLY
AGAINST THIS CHAIN
LETTER THING, EH?

259
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,326
HE FEELS THAT PEOPLE
SHOULD GIVE UP ALL HOPE

260
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:44,862
OF EVER TRYING TO
IMPROVE THEIR SITUATION.

261

WELL, EVERY YEAR I LOOK
AT THE FORTUNE 500 LIST,

AND I NEVER SEE ANYBODY
ON THERE WHO MADE IT

263
00:12:50,034 --> 00:12:52,837
BY SENDING OUT
CHAIN LETTERS.

264
00:12:52,837 --> 00:12:54,605
WELL, THAT'S
THE WAY I FELT,

265
00:12:54,605 --> 00:12:56,207
BUT LOOK AT WHAT
HAPPENED TO HAROLD.

266
00:12:56,207 --> 00:12:59,176
NOTHING HAPPENED TO HAROLD.
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THAT.

GOT $100 BILL IN THE MAIL.

00:14:37,474 --> 00:14:40,744
JUST KINDA PILE
THE GRASS OVER IT.

307
00:14:40,744 --> 00:14:42,980
I DIDN'T REALISE
THAT THEY HAD ACTUALLY

308
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,015
BURIED QUITE A BIT
OF THE PIPE WAY DOWN THERE,

309
00:14:45,015 --> 00:14:47,451
BUT I HAD DONE MY PART,

310
00:14:47,451 --> 00:14:50,287
AND I FIGURED WHY NOT JUST
RELAX FOR A MINUTE OR TWO?

311
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:53,457
AND WALTER AND MIKE WERE JUST
GONNA GO AND GIVE IT A TRY.

312
00:14:53,457 --> 00:14:55,659
TRY OUR NEW SPRINKLER SYSTEM
AND SEE HOW SHE WORKED.

313
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:57,261
BUT THEY TURNED HER ON,

314
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:59,329
AND THEY'RE LOOKIN' FOR THE
LITTLE HEADS TO POP OUT

315
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:02,032
BUT THERE'S NOTHIN' --
NOTHIN' HAPPENIN'.

316
00:15:02,032 --> 00:15:04,168
THEY CAN'T QUITE FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S GOIN' ON,

317
00:15:04,168 --> 00:15:07,204
BUT YOU COULD HEAR THERE WAS
WATER RUNNING SOMEWHERE.

318
00:15:07,204 --> 00:15:09,506
AND I'M STARTIN'
TO GET A --

319
00:15:09,506 --> 00:15:11,775
I'M DREAMING I'M ON
THE TITANIC AT THIS POINT,

320
00:15:11,775 --> 00:15:14,178
AND THEY'RE LOOKIN' AROUND,

321
00:15:14,178 --> 00:15:16,713
TRYING TO FEEL
WHAT'S GOIN' ON.

322
00:15:16,713 --> 00:15:18,715
AND WE GOT A PROBLEM.

323
00:15:18,715 --> 00:15:20,751
AND THEY DOWN
REAL CLOSE THERE,

324
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:22,886
ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY GET
THE ONE HEAD TO POP UP,

325
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:24,688
BUT IT'S JUST NOT --
IT'S NOT --

326
00:15:24,688 --> 00:15:27,558
THERE'S WHERE
THE WATER IS.

327
00:15:27,558 --> 00:15:29,827
SHE'S CAUGHT IN
SOME KIND OF A --

328
00:15:29,827 --> 00:15:33,497
BOY, A BIG JELLY
THING THERE,

329
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:35,899
AND WALTER DECIDES TO
JUST NAIL THAT WITH THE AXE

330
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:38,135
AND JUST RELEASE
THE PRESSURE,

331
00:15:38,135 --> 00:15:40,871
AND UP COMES THE WATER.

332
00:15:40,871 --> 00:15:43,507
GUESS WHO GOT IT ALL?

333
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:45,542
AS CONNIE FRANCIS
WOULD SAY...

334
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:47,711
WHO'S SORRY NOW?

335
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:53,584
.

336
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:11,969
YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY
FRENCHES MY FRIES?

337
00:16:11,969 --> 00:16:13,971
BORROWING SOMEONE'S CAR
AND THEN FINDING OUT

338
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:16,273
IT DOESN'T EVEN
HAVE POWER STEERING.

339
00:16:16,273 --> 00:16:18,909
I MEAN, DRIVING'S SUPPOSED
TO BE PLEASANT AND RELAXING.

340
00:16:18,909 --> 00:16:21,345
IF I WANTED
A WORKOUT, I'D --

341
00:16:21,345 --> 00:16:23,380
WELL, I WOULDN'T
WANT A WORKOUT.

342
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,449
DON'T PANIC.
THERE'S ALWAYS A BETTER WAY.

343
00:16:26,883 --> 00:16:30,454
GET YOURSELF ONE OF THESE
HEAVY DUTY STEERING
WHEEL COVERS HERE.

344
00:16:30,454 --> 00:16:31,989
MAKE IT AN EXTRA LARGE.

345
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:35,325
YOU CAN GET THESE OFF A BUS
WHILE THE DRIVER'S IN
THE MEN'S ROOM.

346
00:16:35,325 --> 00:16:37,494
WE'RE GOING TO SLIP THAT OVER
THE STEERING WHEEL ITSELF

347
00:16:37,494 --> 00:16:40,030
BUT YOU NEED IT EXTRA BIG
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA POWER IT

348
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,965
WITH THIS CORDLESS DRILL.

349
00:16:41,965 --> 00:16:45,102
OKAY, THE KEY HERE IS THE RATIO
BETWEEN THE DIAMETER OF THE
STEERING WHEEL

350
00:16:45,102 --> 00:16:48,271
AND THE SIZE OF THE PULLEY
THAT'S GOING INTO THE
CHUCK OF THE DRILL.

351
00:16:48,271 --> 00:16:51,942
I FIGURE 500:1
IS THE CORRECT RATIO.

352
00:16:51,942 --> 00:16:55,011
SO IF THE STEERING
WHEEL IS 17 INCHES,

353
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:57,814
ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS DIVIDE THAT BY 500.

354
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,461
YOU KNOW, MATHEMATICAL
FORMULAS MAY BE FINE
FOR SOME PEOPLE,

355
00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:13,730
BUT I PREFER
TRIAL AND ERROR --

356
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,466
EVEN THOUGH IT SOMETIMES
LEADS TO TRIAL BY FIRE

357
00:17:16,466 --> 00:17:19,069
AND OCCASIONALLY
TRIAL BY JURY.

358
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:21,238
SO I JUST TRIED A BUNCH OF
DIFFERENT THINGS.

359
00:17:21,238 --> 00:17:23,206
STUCK 'EM INTO THE
CHUCK OF THE DRILL.

360
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:24,741
FOR EXAMPLE, TRIED
A BABY CARRIAGE WHEEL.

361
00:17:24,741 --> 00:17:26,409
TOO BIG.

362
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:27,677
WENT WITH A SCREW NAIL,

00:17:27,677 --> 00:17:29,412
TOO SMALL.

364
00:17:29,412 --> 00:17:33,183
WHAT I AM GOING WITH IS
A GHERKIN PICKLE.

365
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,318
THIS BABY WORKS
LIKE A CHARM.

366
00:17:35,318 --> 00:17:37,654

WHAT IF I WANT
TO TURN THE OTHER WAY?

369
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:46,796
WELL, HEY, THIS IS
A REVERSING DRILL.

00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:56,926

THE CONCEPT OF GETTING
