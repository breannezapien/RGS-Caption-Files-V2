FIRST AND DON'T TAKE THEM
OFF UNTIL IT'S REAL, REAL DARK.

THE COMMON NAME FOR
A HOLE THAT IS IN A TREE.

REALIZE THAT A TREE HOLE
IS ACTUALLY A TREE'S MOUTH.

TOO MUCH CASH IN THESE THINGS.

THE RINGS ON YOUR FACE AND STUFF

IN THE CITY.

460
00:20:56,853 --> 00:20:58,988
AND THEN, ONCE IN
A WHILE, YOU COME UP
HERE TO THE LODGE

461
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:00,756
AND BE ON THE
SHOW HERE.

462
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,225
OKAY -- OKAY LET'S TRY IT.

463
00:21:02,258 --> 00:21:03,326
LET'S GIVE IT A SHOT.

464
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,560
ALL RIGHT GOOD
FOR YOU.

465
00:21:04,627 --> 00:21:06,562
I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING, HAROLD,

466
00:21:06,629 --> 00:21:08,364
YOU'RE NOT SUCH
A BAD GUY.

467
00:21:08,431 --> 00:21:09,599
I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING, UNCLE RED,

468
00:21:09,665 --> 00:21:11,868
YOU'RE NOT SUCH A
BAD GUY EITHER.

469
00:21:11,934 --> 00:21:13,469
YOU KNOW
SOMETHING ELSE?

470
00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:15,638
YOU'RE PRETTY SMART.

471
00:21:15,938 --> 00:21:17,707
YOU'RE NOT SUCH
A BAD GUY EITHER.

472
00:21:17,773 --> 00:21:19,909
[ APPLAUSE AND LAUGHTER ]

473
00:21:20,877 --> 00:21:22,078
OH, MEETING TIME.
I GOTTA GO.

474
00:21:22,144 --> 00:21:24,213
YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
HAROLD.

475
00:21:24,514 --> 00:21:25,615
WELL, THAT'S IT
FOR OUR SHOW,

476
00:21:25,648 --> 00:21:27,149
BUT BE SURE TO TUNE IN
NEXT TIME

477
00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:28,784
WHEN I'M GOING TO
MAKE A VISIT TO THE
CITY AND VISIT HAROLD

478
00:21:28,818 --> 00:21:30,987
BEFORE HE LOSES
THAT JOB OF HIS.

479
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,421
AND IF MY WIFE IS
WATCHING,

480
00:21:32,455 --> 00:21:34,824
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING,

481
00:21:34,891 --> 00:21:36,993
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
HAROLD HAS FINALLY
MATURED AND GROWN UP,

482
00:21:37,026 --> 00:21:40,396
BUT I DON'T SEE
IT HAPPENING TO
ME ANY TIME SOON.

483
00:21:40,696 --> 00:21:43,165
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING, AND
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF

484
00:21:43,199 --> 00:21:46,602
AND, WELL, THE WHOLE GANG
UP HERE AT POSSUM LODGE

485
00:21:46,636 --> 00:21:50,373
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

ALL RIGHT, MEN, BOW YOUR
HEADS FOR THE MAN'S PRAYER.

491
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,172
I'M A MAN,

492
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:24,874
BUT I CAN CHANGE,

493
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,675
IF I HAVE TO,

494
00:22:26,742 --> 00:22:27,977
I GUESS.
