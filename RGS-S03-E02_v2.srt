HOW TO MODERNIZE YOUR HOME,

TO MAKE IT NOT ONLY MORE

142
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,329
CONVENIENT FOR YOUR FAMILY BUT

143
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,263
ALSO EASIER TO SELL WHEN THAT

AND I'LL TELL YOU YOU CAN PRETTY

154
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,278
WELL NAME YOUR OWN PRIZE ON

155
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:40,613
THESE UNITS BECAUSE THERE IS

156
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,814
VERY LITTLE DEMAND SURPRISINGLY

157
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:44,917
ENOUGH FOR THE USED TOILET.

158
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,185
NOW YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO NEED

159
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:48,420
A BUNCH OF THE A.B.S. DRAIN PIPE

160
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,624

00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,458
FITTINGS YOU KNOW THE 'T'S AND

162
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,926
THE ELBOWS AND WHAT HAVE YOU,

163
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,895
SO THAT YOU CAN CONNECT ALL OF

164
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,029
THIS STUFF INTO YOUR EXISTING

NOW YOU CAN USE THE EPOXY CEMENT

167
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:03,235
ON THAT OR YOU COULD YOU USE

168
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:08,073
GUM OR EVEN POP RIVETS.

169
00:05:08,073 --> 00:05:08,941

00:05:12,778 --> 00:05:14,280
OKAY NOW YOU PUT ONE OF THESE

172
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,148
UNITS IN EACH OF THE ROOMS

173
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:17,650
YOU USE MOST OFTEN AND YOU

174
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,751
HOOK THEM RIGHT INTO THE DRAIN

175
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,319
SYSTEM LIKE I'VE DONE HERE.

176
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,787
THEY SAY THAT A MAN'S HOME

177
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:23,288
IS HIS CASTLE WELL NOW YOU CAN

178
00:05:23,288 --> 00:05:25,624
HAVE A THRONE IN EVERY ROOM.

179
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:26,825
AND PUT THE UNIT RIGHT OUT IN

180
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:28,360
THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM LIKE

181
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,261
THIS BECAUSE THIS IS NO LONGER

182
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:30,963

183
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,965
CUSTOM MADE ROOM TO ROOM

184
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,600
INTERCOM SYSTEM,

185
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,035
A COMBINATION TRANSISTOR

186
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:39,238
AND RECEIVER OR A TRANSCEIVER

187
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,306
AS WE CALL IT IN THE BUSINESS.

188
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:42,207
AND THE DRAIN SYSTEM BECOMES

189
00:05:42,207 --> 00:05:43,842
YOUR DISTRIBUTION GRID,

190
00:05:43,842 --> 00:05:44,743

ROOF READER AS I'VE DONE HERE

192
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:47,880
YOU NOW HAVE A TWO WAY

193
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,014
PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM

194
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:51,116
RIGHT OUT TO YOUR FRONT DOOR.

195
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:52,117
SO YOU CAN YOU KNOW GREET

196
00:05:52,117 --> 00:05:54,086
YOUR GUESTS OR TELL THE POLICE

197
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:56,922
THAT YOU'RE NOT HOME OR WHATEVER

198
00:05:56,922 --> 00:05:57,856
NOW WHEN YOU WANT TO SIGNAL

199
00:05:57,856 --> 00:06:01,059
PEOPLE ON THE SECOND FLOOR

200
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:01,994
INSTEAD OF USING A BUZZER TAKE

201
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,195

202
00:06:03,195 --> 00:06:04,897

205
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:09,802
AND THEN HOOK THAT RIGHT

206
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,904
ONTO THE FLUSHER HANDLE,

207
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:12,805
AND THEN WHEN YOU WANT

208
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:13,906
TO CALL SOMEBODY

209
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:18,110

WELL THIS IS A QUESTION

215
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:26,318
I'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH

216
00:06:26,318 --> 00:06:27,986
THROUGHOUT MY LIFE,

217
00:06:27,986 --> 00:06:29,454
AND I MUST ADMIT YOU GET ONE

218
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:31,957

THE OCCASIONAL PUFF OF METHANE

220
00:06:32,824 --> 00:06:35,194
CAN PUT YOU OFF FOR DINNER,

221
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,261

222
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:39,198
IT WILL PUT YOU OFF YOUR SEAT.

223
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:40,299
THE BEST WAY AND EASIEST WAY

224
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,000
TO KEEP YOURSELF AWAY FROM

225
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,335
THE ODOURS OF THE UNDER WORLD

226
00:06:43,335 --> 00:06:44,503

228
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:46,905
NOT A WHOLE BUNCH JUST

229
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:52,010
ENOUGH TO FILL THE TRAP.

230

FUMES? WHAT FUMES?

231

WHAT WE CALL A BREAKDOWN IN

234

235

GET THAT ONE OUT OF THE WAY

521
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,206
JUST AS I WAS ARRIVING.

522
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:43,473
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL DAY

523
00:15:43,473 --> 00:15:44,474
A LITTLE BIT OF A BREEZE

524
00:15:44,474 --> 00:15:45,776
THERE AND BILL HAD THE CHAINSAW

525
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:47,644
HAPPENING AND HE HAD AN AXE

526
00:15:47,644 --> 00:15:48,679
AND HE HAD THE TREE SAW

527
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:50,113
THERE SO HE'S PRETTY WELL SET

528
00:15:50,113 --> 00:15:53,183
FOR ANYTHING, HE RAN OUT OF GAS

529
00:15:53,183 --> 00:15:55,185
AND YOU'RE ALL SET YOU'RE GOING

530
00:15:55,185 --> 00:15:56,353

(ENGINE SPUTTERING)

535
00:16:00,324 --> 00:16:01,391
SOME OF THESE DON'T START RIGHT

00:16:01,391 --> 00:16:04,661
ON THE FIRST PULL YOU KNOW,

537
00:16:04,661 --> 00:16:05,596

I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE OF THESE

548
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:25,515
BEFORE IT'S KIND OF A SWEDISH

549
00:16:25,515 --> 00:16:29,119
LOOK AT THAT, UNBELIEVABLE!

550
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:30,253
MUST BE A TINY LITTLE MOTOR

551
00:16:30,253 --> 00:16:31,021
THERE I COULDN'T EVEN SEE

552
00:16:31,021 --> 00:16:32,356
AN ENGINE ON THAT UNIT

553
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:33,824
NO EXHAUST OR ANYTHING.

554
00:16:33,824 --> 00:16:35,325
NOW THIS TREE APPARENTLY IS

555
00:16:35,325 --> 00:16:36,393
OFFENDING BILL IN SOMEWAY SO

556
00:16:36,393 --> 00:16:38,295
SHE'S GOING TO COME DOWN

557
00:16:38,295 --> 00:16:39,096
AND THAT LITTLE RIG

558
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:42,132
INCREDIBLE ISN'T IT?

559
00:16:42,132 --> 00:16:42,866
AMAZING WHAT THEY'RE DOING

560
00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:43,700
NOW WITH THE COMPUTER CHIPS

SO HE'S GOT HER ALL CUT OUT

563
00:16:46,236 --> 00:16:47,204
THERE NOW HE'S GOT THE AXE

564
00:16:47,204 --> 00:16:48,472
AND HE'S GOT THIS THING SHARP

565
00:16:48,472 --> 00:16:49,673
UNBELIEVABLE, THAT'S A

566
00:16:49,673 --> 00:16:50,774
PROFESSIONAL AXE HE'S GOT

567

RIGHT THERE.

568
00:16:52,776 --> 00:16:55,779
OH, OH, OH, NOW LUCKILY I HAD

00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:58,315
SOME DUCT TAPE IN MY WALLET

570
00:16:58,315 --> 00:16:59,015

INSTEAD OF MY WALLET.

572
00:17:01,017 --> 00:17:02,552
NOW HE MARKS A NOTCH HERE

573
00:17:02,552 --> 00:17:03,887
KIND OF A 'V' THING, HE'S

574
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:05,055
GOING TO CUT THAT OUT WITH

575
00:17:05,055 --> 00:17:06,323
AN AXE AND THEN THAT WILL

576
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:07,357
DETERMINE WHICH WAY

577
00:17:07,357 --> 00:17:08,391
THE TREE FALLS.

578
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:09,659
THIS IS PROBABLY GOING TO TAKE

579
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:10,694
A LITTLE WHILE SO I'LL GET BACK

580
