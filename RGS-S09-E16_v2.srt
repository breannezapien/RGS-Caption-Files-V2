1
00:00:01,801 --> 00:00:03,370
YOU KNOW THERE'S
NOTHING WORSE IN LIFE

2
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:06,673
THAN WHEN SOMETHING FUN
TURNS INTO WORK.

3
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:09,442
YOU MARRIED GUYS KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,177
YOU TAKE ICE
SKATING FOR EXAMPLE.

5
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:12,579
I MEAN THAT'S FUN.

6
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:14,347
BUT LIKE SO MANY
PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES,

7
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,549
IT'S TOO DARN PHYSICAL.

8
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,252
WELL, HERE'S A WAY YOU
CAN STRAP ON THE BLADES,

9
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:21,755
BURN AROUND THE ICE,
WITHOUT EVEN BREAKING A SWEAT.

10
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:25,625
RECOGNIZE THIS?

11
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,827
IT'S A ROTARY
TELEVISION AERIAL.

12
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,463
YOU KNOW IN THE
DAYS LONG BEFORE CABLE,

13
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,799
THE WHOLE STREET WOULD COME
ALIVE EVERY HALF-HOUR

14
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:34,634
WITH THESE BABIES
GRINDING AND HUMMING

15
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,404
AS Mr AND Mrs JOHN Q. PUBLIC
WOULD SPIN THE DIAL

16
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:40,073
IN SEARCH OF SOMETHING HALF
DECENT TO WATCH.

17
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,744
OKAY, NOWADAYS, WE'RE
ALL SUPPOSED TO BE WIRED

18
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,746
OR WIRELESS OR
ON-LINE OR SOMETHING,

19
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,649
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE
CAN'T USE OUR ROTARY ANTENNAS

20
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,518
TO HAVE A
LITTLE BIT OF FUN.

21
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:06,066
[cheering and applause]

22
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:20,613
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

23
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:21,948
SURE DO APPRECIATE THAT.

24
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,117
YOU KNOW, THIS SEASON IS MY
FAVOURITE UP AT THE LODGE,

25
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,953
ALONG WITH THE OTHER
THREE, OF COURSE.

26
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:28,822
THIS IS THE HARVEST
TIME OF YEAR.

27
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:30,323
YOU CAN GET THE
FRESH FRUIT AND EVERYTHING.

28
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,025
IT'S - IT'S
REALLY A GREAT TIME.

29
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,960
I GOT SOME PLUMS
FOR YOU Mr GREEN.

30
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,361
YOU LIKE PLUMS?
OH, I SURE DO.

31
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,063
WHERE'D YOU
GET THOSE, MIKE?
THOMPSON'S ORCHARD.

32
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,932
OH,
THEY'LL BE GOOD.

33
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:39,666
HOW MUCH

34
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:42,569
THEY COST YOU?
NOTHING.

35
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:45,738
I JUST SAW THIS SIGN
THAT SAID "PICK YOUR OWN."

36
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:50,110
OH, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
WERE SUPPOSED TO PAY.

37
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,845
THEY NEED A
BETTER SYSTEM.

38
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,247
THEY NEED A
BETTER FENCE, MIKE.

39
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:56,516
JUST PUT THEM ON THE
TABLE UNTIL THEY COOL
OFF A LITTLE, EH?

40
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:02,021
WOW! IS THIS THE
COMPUTER HAROLD SENT YOU?

41
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,591
YEAH, YEAH, HIS COMPANY'S
GETTING RID OF ALL THEIR
OLD COMPUTERS,

42
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:05,992
SO HE GAVE THEM TO ME.

43
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:09,362
THERE'S A FLATTERING GIFT.
I'M LIKE A GARBAGE MAN
WITHOUT A DUMP.

44
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,733
NO, YOU HAVE A DUMP.

45
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,503
HEY, RED, RED.
DID YOU GET MY E-MAIL?

46
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,271
NO, I HAVEN'T BEEN DOWN
TO THE POST OFFICE YET.

47
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,907
NO, IT'S E-MAIL.
YOU DON'T GO DOWN
TO THE POST OFFICE.

48
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,742
IT'S WAITING
IN YOUR COMPUTER.

49
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,477
HERE, LOOK.

50
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,012
YOU JUST DIAL
UP THE NETWORK.

51
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:27,580
WAIT FOR
A CONNECTION.

52
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,716
ENTER YOUR PASSWORD.

53
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:30,950
LISTEN.

54
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:33,119
SULTRY FEMALE VOICE:
You have mail.

55
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,421
THERE IT IS!
SEE!

56
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:36,923
THERE'S THE
E-MAIL I SENT YOU.

57
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,158
GO ON, READ IT.
READ IT.

58
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,397
"HI, RED."

59
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,066
ISN'T THAT GREAT!

60
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,401
NO PAPER.
NO ENVELOPE.

61
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,403
AND NO STAMP.

62
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,972
AND NO
PURPOSE, DALTON.

63
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,641
IT DOESN'T
COST ANYTHING?

64
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:56,709
LIKE E-MAIL
IS FREE MAIL?

65
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,011
NO, NOT QUITE, MIKE.

66
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:00,980
THE SERVER CHARGES YOU A MONTHLY
FEE ON YOUR CREDIT CARD.

67
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,215
OH, THERE'S A FEE.

68
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:05,718
SO IT'S FEMALE.
NO WONDER I DON'T
UNDERSTAND IT.

69
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,562
THIS IS THE REPAIR SHOP
PART OF THE SHOW WE CALL

70
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:18,364
IF IT AIN'T BROKE,
YOU'RE NOT TRYING.

71
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,500
JOINING ME
TODAY IS MIKE HAMAR.

72
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:21,834
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
FOR US HERE, MIKE?

73
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,970
YEAH, I'VE GOT A
SUITCASE, OF MINE,

74
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,240
AND I CAN'T SEEM
TO GET IT OPEN, THOUGH.

75
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,775
WELL, IT'S
LOCKED, MIKE.

76
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,311
YEAH, AND WELL, YOU KNOW,
I'VE LOST THE KEYS.

77
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,546
WELL, YOU
DON'T NEED KEYS.

78
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,615
THESE ARE
COMBINATION LOCKS.

79
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,550
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

80
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,485
I PACKED THIS
ABOUT A YEAR AGO,

81
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,754
AND I'VE JUST FORGOTTEN
ALL THE NUMBERS.

82
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,590
BUT I WAS HOPING
THAT MAYBE YOU COULD

83
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,758
TAKE THE HAMMER AND
SMASH THE LOCKS OFF.

84
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:47,327
THEN I COULD
GET IN, RIGHT?

85
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,761
THIS IS
A REPAIR SHOP.

86
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,897
IT'S NOT A
DESTROY SHOP.

87
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,398
YEAH, WELL, I KNOW,

88
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:55,702
BUT RIGHT NOW, THE SUITCASE
IS UNUSABLE, RIGHT?

89
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,937
SO IT'S, LIKE,
BROKEN IN A WAY.

90
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,806
BUT IF YOU SMASH
THE LOCKS OFF,

91
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:00,940
THEN I COULD
GET IN THERE,

92
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,343
AND THEN IT WOULD
BE FIXED IN A WAY.

93
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,845
OKAY, IF I HELP
YOU OPEN THIS SUITCASE

94
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,815
I'M AN ACCOMPLICE
IN A WAY.

95
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,517
WHAT?
NO. NO. NO.

96
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:12,552
YOU DON'T GET
IT, Mr GREEN.

97
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,153
THIS IS
MY SUITCASE.

98
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,855
HONEST.
HONEST, I SWEAR.

99
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,557
YOU SWEAR?
I SWEAR.

100
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,859
THE POSSUM LODGE SWEAR?

101
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,463
ALL RIGHT.

102
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,398
OH, BOY, I CAN HARDLY WAIT
TO SEE WHAT'S IN IT.

103
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,134
I MEAN TO REMEMBER
WHAT I LEFT INSIDE IT.

104
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,907
BLACK T-SHIRT.

105
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,143
ANOTHER
BLACK T-SHIRT.

106
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,412
JEANS ALREADY
ROLLED UP.

107
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,581
WHITE SOCKS.

108
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,916
HOLY COW.
IT REALLY IS YOURS.

109
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,551
OH, I APOLOGIZE, MIKE.

110
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,253
I ALWAYS THINK
YOU'RE UP TO NO GOOD.

111
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,988
I'M SORRY
ABOUT THAT.

112
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,290
THAT'S OKAY,
Mr GREEN.

113
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:51,658
I FORGIVE YOU.

114
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,660
OH, HERE'S WHAT
I'M LOOKING FOR.

115
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,262
HERE IT IS,
MY BALACLAVA.

116
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,768
WHAT DO YOU NEED
A BALACLAVA FOR, MIKE?

117
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,904
I NEED IT
FOR SNOWMOBILING.

118
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:07,106
IT'S NOT
WINTER YET.

119
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:09,342
I MEAN I NEED IT
TO GET A SNOWMOBILE.

120
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,277
THANKS A
LOT, Mr GREEN.

121
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,346
MIKE. MIKE. MIKE!

122
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:23,022
[hoarse breathing]

123
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,459
THIS BETTER
BE GOOD, HAROLD.

124
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:27,894
I BURNED HALF A
TANK OF GAS

125
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,529
AND AN AFTERNOON NAP
JUST GETTING DOWN HERE.

126
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:30,763
OKAY. OKAY.
UNCLE RED.

127
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,231
YOU KNOW HOW SOME
REALLY IMPORTANT PEOPLE

128
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:33,900
HAVE SOMEONE WHO
DOES EVERYTHING FOR THEM,

129
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,735
EVERY MENIAL TASK,
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE TOO BUSY

130
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,303
OR TOO LAZY TO
DO FOR THEMSELVES?

131
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,805
WELL, YEAH.

132
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,306
THAT'S WHY I'M
THE LODGE LEADER, HAROLD.

133
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,409
OKAY. AROUND HERE,
WE CALL THEM SECRETARIES.

134
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:44,677
OH, MY GOSH,

135
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:45,945
YOU GOT YOURSELF A PROMOTION.

136
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,747
YEAH, STARTING TODAY.

137
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,449
WELL,
WHERE IS SHE?

138
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,351
WHO?

139
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,019
WELL, YOUR
NEW SECRETARY.

140
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,221
WELL, WHO SAYS THE SECRETARY
HAS TO BE A WOMAN?

141
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:58,191
WELL, ALL RIGHT,
Mr 21ST CENTURY.

142
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:01,194
WHAT PATHETIC GUY DID THEY HIRE
TO BE YOUR SECRETARY?

143
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:02,729
I'M NOT GETTING
A SECRETARY.

144
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,464
I AM THE
SECRETARY.

145
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:07,467
YEAH. I'M THE SECRETARY TO THE
VICE-PRESIDENT OF MERGERS
AND ACQUISITIONS.

146
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,469
LA LA 

147
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,471
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU GOT A PROMOTION?

148
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,972
THIS IS
A PROMOTION.

149
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,273
I ACTUALLY RANK
HIGHER IN THE COMPANY,

150
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,075
THAN MY SUPERVISOR
IN MY OLD DEPARTMENT.

151
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,977
I'M GOING TO BE HELPING
THE BOSS ORGANIZE MEETINGS,

152
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,412
SCHEDULING THINGS.

153
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,647
WOMAN'S VOICE:
Harold, could you come
in here for a moment, please?

154
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,316
YES, MA'AM.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

155
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,451
WHO WAS
THAT, HAROLD?

156
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:28,554
MY BOSS, THE VICE-PRESIDENT OF
MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS.

157
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,656
OH, MAN, HAROLD,

158
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,358
YOU'VE GOT
A WOMEN BOSS.

159
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:35,361
SO? SO DO YOU,
AUNT BERNICE.

160
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,864
OH, COME ON, HAROLD.
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

161
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,031
YEAH, I KNOW.

162
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,900
I GET PAID.

163
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,972
WELCOME TO
TALKING ANIMALS

164
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,207
WITH THE LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL
OFFICER, ED FRID.

165
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,442
I UNDERSTAND THAT
ED HAS BROUGHT IN

166
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,844
A VERY, VERY
DANGEROUS SNAKE TODAY.

167
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,180
SO C'MON
UP HERE, ED.

168
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,950
NO, NO, C'MON.
YOU'LL BE FINE.

169
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,252
C'MON UP HERE.

170
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,689
SO WHAT KIND
OF SNAKE IS THIS?

171
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,458
IT'S A COBRA.

172
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:08,194
A COBRA. WOW!
YOU BROUGHT IN A COBRA.

173
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:09,929
YEAH. YEAH.

174
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,565
WHAT WAS
I THINKING?

175
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,600
OKAY, SO, CAN WE HAVE A
LOOK AT IT, ED?

176
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,602
OH. NO. NO.

177
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:19,539
UM, I THINK WE'D BETTER JUST
LEAVE IT IN THE BASKET.

178
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:22,742
OH, NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S KIND OF WUSSY.

179
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:25,445
RED, THIS IS A
BLACK-NECKED COBRA,

180
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,513
BETTER KNOWN AS
A SPITTING COBRA.

181
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,215
OH, THEY SPIT
THE POISON, YEAH.

182
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,417
HOW FAR CAN THAT
COBRA SPIT THE POISON?

183
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,553
FARTHER
THAN THIS.

184
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,856
ARE WE
SAFE HERE, ED?

185
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,058
OH, YEAH, AS LONG AS THE
LID STAYS ON THE BASKET.

186
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:45,331
UH, ED.

187
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,468
WHAT?

188
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,003
I THINK THE LID
CAME OFF THE BASKET.

189
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,672
REALLY?

190
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:56,042
UM, WHAT ARE
YOU GONNA DO?

191
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,612
I HAVE NO PLANS.

192
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,017
WHY DON'T YOU PUT THE
LID BACK ON THE BASKET?

193
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,887
WHY DON'T YOU PUT THE LID
BACK ON THE BASKET?

194
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,422
OH. OH.
AH! AH!

195
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,123
OH-H-H.

196
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,859
STAY STILL.
DON'T MOVE.

197
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,660
HE'S STARING
RIGHT AT ME, ED.

198
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,729
DON'T MOVE.

199
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,431
HE'S GETTING
READY TO SPIT.

200
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:19,932
OH, SO AM I.

201
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,338
OR DID YOU SAY SPIT?

202
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,016
TAKE THIS
GARBAGE CAN LID,

203
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,384
AND PUT IT IN
FRONT OF YOUR FACE.

204
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,186
IT WILL
SHIELD YOU.

205
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,821
BRACE YOURSELF.

206
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,010
I'M OKAY.

207
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,549
Red:
I'M SURE THIS
HAS HAPPENED TO YOU.

208
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:10,883
YOU'RE DRIVING
DOWN THE STREET

209
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,219
THINKING ABOUT YOUR LIFE AND HOW
IT'S EVERYBODY ELSE'S FAULT,

210
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,421
WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN...

211
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,098
ALL RIGHT, NO MATTER HOW
MAD YOU GET AT THESE
SMART-ALEC'S,

212
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,833
DON'T RUN AFTER THEM.

213
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,268
YOU'LL JUST
LOOK LIKE A FOOL.

214
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,103
NEVER CHASE TEENAGERS.

215
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,705
YOU'LL EITHER
HAVE A HEART ATTACK

216
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,841
OR FALL ON THE ICE AND RIP THE
CROTCH RIGHT OUT OF YOUR PANTS.

217
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,310
THAT'S MORE
OF A SUMMER THING.

218
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,247
I SAY,
DON'T GET MAD,

219
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,982
GET CREATIVE.

220
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:45,418
WHAT I'VE DONE HERE
IS TAKEN AN OLD PIE PLATE,

221
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:48,321
NAILED IT ONTO

222
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,156
THE BOTTOM END OF MY HAMMER.

223
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,624
THAT'S ACTUALLY
GOING TO BE A VALVE,

224
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,559
BUT YOU KNOW I'M GETTING A
LITTLE AHEAD OF MYSELF HERE.

225
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,027
BEFORE I DO THAT,

226
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,430
I'M GOING TO MOUNT THIS OLD
COOLER ON THE ROOF OF
THE POSSUM VAN.

227
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:58,864
BUT BEFORE
I DO THAT,

228
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,733
I'M GOING TO MAKE UP
A HUGE BATCH OF SNOWBALLS

229
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,802
AND PUT
THEM IN HERE.

230
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,103
OH, MAN.

231
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,542
DARN SUPERBOWL.

232
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:14,814
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS WHERE THE
HAMMER-VALVE COMES IN.

233
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,349
I'VE GOT IT MOUNTED
ON THE CEILING HERE,

234
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,050
AND I'VE PUNCHED A HOLE
UP THROUGH THE COOLER

235
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,652
AND THROUGH THE ROOF OF THE VAN.

236
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:22,121
ACTUALLY THERE ALREADY WAS
A HOLE IN THE ROOF OF THE VAN.

237
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:25,424
DON'T EVER GO OVER A SPEED BUMP
WITH A POP CAN IN YOUR HAND.

238
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,260
NOW, I GOT THIS STRING ATTACHED
TO THE BOTTOM OF THE HAMMER,

239
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:31,230
AND WHEN I'M READY
FOR A SNOWBALL...

240
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:36,102
YOU'D BE AMAZED
AT HOW EASY THESE

241
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,371
PITCHING MACHINES
ARE TO COME BY

242
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:40,706
IN THE OFF SEASON.

243
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,009
ALL I'VE GOT TO DO NOW
IS GET IT UP INTO THE VAN,

244
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,845
LINE HER UP
UNDER THE SNOWBALL HOLE,

245
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,880
AND SET THE CONTROL
FOR THE HIGH, HARD ONE.

246
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,029
ALL RIGHT, I'VE GOT HER ALL
LINED UP AND IN POSITION.

247
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,464
NOW ALL I'VE GOT TO DO IS
CLOSE MY BOMBAY DOORS.

248
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,635
THIS IS GREAT, ISN'T IT?

249
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,404
I'VE ALSO GOT AN IDEA
ON HOW TO STOP KIDS FROM

250
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,172
HANGING ON TO
YOUR BACK BUMPER.

251
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,508
I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT.
IT INVOLVES A HEAVY-DUTY
TRUCK BATTERY.

252
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:20,379
BUT FIRST, LET'S GO KICK SOME
SNOWBALL-THROWING BUTT.

253
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,608
WELL, DALTON, I'M SURE GLAD
YOU CAME BY TO SEE ME

254
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:25,544
BEFORE YOU ABANDONED
YOUR FAMILY AND HEADED
OFF TO MEXICO.

255
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,946
THE YUCATAN, RED.

256
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,848
IT'S THE YUCATAN,
AND I WOULDN'T HAVE
COME TO SEE YOU

257
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,250
IF I DIDN'T NEED 50
BUCKS FOR GAS.

258
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,619
WELL, I WASN'T GOING
TO GIVE YOU CASH, DALTON.

259
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:36,522
I WAS JUST GOING TO
LEND YOU MY SIPHON HOSE.

260
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,790
IS IT WRONG?

261
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,925
IS IT CRAZY FOR ME
TO HAVE A DREAM?

262
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:42,128
IS IT WRONG FOR ME
TO WANT TO HELP PEOPLE?

263
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,196
WELL, NO.
NOT NECESSARILY.

264
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,766
BUT I JUST THINK RUNNING OFF
TO JOIN A LEPER COLONY

265
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:49,034
IS MAYBE A LITTLE EXTREME.

266
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,469
WELL, IT'S
MY DREAM, RED.

267
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:53,906
I WANT TO GO SOMEPLACE PRIMITIVE
WHERE I CAN HELP UNFORTUNATES.

268
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,275
YOU CAN DO THAT
RIGHT AT THE LODGE HERE.

269
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,144
IT'S NOT
THE SAME THING.

270
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,846
NO, I KNOW, DALTON.

271
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,584
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT
YOUR RUNNING OFF TO
A LEPER COLONY

272
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,420
INDICATES MAYBE YOU'VE GOT SOME
TROUBLES HERE AT HOME?

273
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,860
WELL, POSSIBLY.

274
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,396
I THINK MAYBE YOU'RE
RUNNING OFF TO A
LEPER COLONY

275
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:20,432
TO AVOID TALKING
TO YOUR WIFE.

276
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,135
I ALSO THINK YOU SHOULD
GO UPSTAIRS RIGHT NOW

277
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,738
AND SAY SOMETHING
NICE TO HER.

278
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,174
WELL, LIKE WHAT?

279
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,643
WELL, I DON'T KNOW, DALTON.

280
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:33,546
WHAT DID YOU TWO TALK ABOUT
WHEN YOU WERE DATING?

281
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,447
AMWAY.

282
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,188
DID YOU TELL HER ABOUT
YOUR LITTLE ADVENTURE
YOU GOT PLANNED?

283
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,556
YES, YES, I LEFT
A NOTE SAYING

284
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,891
THAT I WAS GOING TO LIVE
IN A LEPER COLONY IN
THE YUCATAN.

285
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,727
[woman laughing]

286
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:49,762
YES!

287
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,132
[woman laughing]

288
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:54,934
CHAMPAGNE.

289
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,836
SHE'S TAKING
IT WELL.

290
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,472
[woman singing and cheering]

291
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,443
MAN, THIS COMPUTER
CRAZE IS WRECKING OUR TOWN.

292
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:06,745
NOBODY IS OUTDOORS.
NOBODY IS DOING ANYTHING.

293
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,180
INSTEAD OF PULLED MUSCLES
AND HERNIAS

294
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,883
ALL WE GOT IS
CARPAL-TUNNEL SYNDROME.

295
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,919
I GOT NO USE
FOR THE DARN THING.

296
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,321
BUT YOU CAN'T
EVEN TURN IT OFF.

297
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:16,288
IT'S LIKE HAROLD.

298
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,623
OH, YOU CAN
TURN IT OFF, RED.

299
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:20,259
JUST GOT TO SHUT
ALL THE WINDOWS FIRST.

300
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,264
WELL, NOW,
THAT MAKES SENSE.

301
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,832
YOU GOT TO KEEP UP
WITH TECHNOLOGY,

302
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,500
OR IT'S GOING TO
LEAVE YOU BEHIND.

303
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,202
THIS ISN'T
PROGRESS, DALTON.

304
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,804
EVERYBODY IS LOCKED
AWAY IN THEIR HOUSE

305
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,273
SENDING OUT MESSAGES,
LIKE THEY'RE CAVEMEN

306
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,575
BEATING ON THEIR DRUMS,
FOR GOSH SAKES.

307
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,544
SULTRY FEMALE VOICE:
You have mail.

308
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,746
OKAY, HOW MANY E-MAIL
MESSAGES IS THAT FOR ME?

309
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,648
NINETY-THREE.

310
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:46,785
ALTHOUGH 85 OF THEM ARE
ME ASKING YOU TO PICK
UP YOUR E-MAIL.

311
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,623
YOU KNOW, RED, THERE'S
WAY MORE TO COMPUTERS THAN THIS.

312
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,992
COME ON OVER HERE I'LL SHOW
YOU HOW THE INTERNET WORKS.

313
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,360
OH, I KNOW,

314
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:58,530
WWW.SIT-ON-YOUR-BUTT-FOR-
12-HOURS-A-DAY.COM.

315
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:06,372
THIS IS THE GREATEST SOURCE
OF INFORMATION IN THE WORLD.

316
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:10,509
OKAY, NOW, SAY YOU WANTED TO
KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT, UM,

317
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,977
PLUMS.

318
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,480
OKAY, YOU TYPE IN PLUMS.

319
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,615
LOOK AT ALL THE
INFORMATION YOU GET.

320
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:17,917
LOOK. LOOK.

321
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,519
THERE'S A GUY WITH
THE WORLD'S LARGEST PLUM.

322
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,956
WOW! LOOK AT THE
SIZE OF THAT THING!

323
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,558
NO, HE'S HOLDING
THE PLUM.

324
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,728
YOU'RE LOOKING
AT HIS WIFE.

325
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:32,264
AND LOOK, HERE'S SOME
STUFF YOU DIDN'T KNOW,

326
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,366
LIKE PLUMS GOT
VITAMIN C AND D,

327
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,534
THEY FLOAT,

328
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,103
AND PLUMS
CONDUCT ELECTRICITY.

329
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,805
OH, NO.
NOT THESE ONES.

330
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:41,273
MIKE SAID
THERE WAS NO CHARGE.

331
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,753
OH, RED, RED,
IT'S DONE ON TIME.

332
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,956
I GOT MY NEW ANIMATED
FEATURE READY ON TIME.

333
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,624
WERE YOU WORRIED?

334
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,793
YOU ALWAYS
WORRY ME, GORD.

335
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,496
YOU KNOW, THIS FILM
IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

336
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,198
I STILL DREW ALL THE
PICTURES AND DID
ALL THE VOICES,

337
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:09,101
BUT I THINK THE SUBJECT
MATTER IS VERY EDGY.

338
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,637
YES, WELL, I'M VERY EDGY
RIGHT NOW MYSELF.

339
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,606
OH, SUET?

340
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:17,276
UM, NO THANK YOU.

341
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,711
NO, NO, NO.

342
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,612
YOU SURE?
WINTER'S COMING.

343
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:24,750
NOT IF I EAT
THAT IT ISN'T.

344
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:28,053
NOW, RED, HOW MUCH DO
YOU KNOW ABOUT ROCKS?

345
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,089
ROCKS?
OH, I KNOW
ENOUGH ABOUT ROCKS.

346
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:31,557
NOT ENOUGH.
LET ME TEACH YOU.

347
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:32,992
WATCH.

348
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:37,062
[quirky upbeat music]

349
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:55,414
PLEASE, MASTER RANGER GORD,

350
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:59,151
TEACH US THE WAYS OF,
LIKE, HOW NATURE IS.

351
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:02,788
FINE THEN.
PAY ATTENTION.

352
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,692
YOUR FIRST LESSON WILL BE ABOUT
THESE THICK-SHELLED EGGS,

353
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,994
WHICH OCCUR ABUNDANTLY
IN NATURE.

354
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:12,097
UH, THAT'S A STONE GORD.

355
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,669
WOW! THAT STONE
WAS AN EGG.

356
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,204
ALL STONES ARE EGGS.

357
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,774
OPEN YOUR EYES, YOU FOOLS.

358
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,878
SO ALL OF THESE
STONES AROUND US, EH,

359
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,279
ARE ACTUALLY EGGS.

360
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,580
DON'T YOU SEE?

361
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,282
STONES HAVE BEEN FOOLING
US FOR MANY YEARS.

362
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:33,152
WE'VE JUST ASSUMED THAT
STONES ARE MADE OUT OF
NOTHING BUT ROCK.

363
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:38,190
WHERE DO THE STONES THAT ARE
ACTUALLY EGGS COME FROM?

364
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:41,226
ATTRACTIVE WOMEN
IN HOT AIR BALLOONS

365
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,829
DISTRIBUTE THE EGGS ALL
AROUND THE WORLD.

366
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,598
OH, THAT'S
RIDICULOUS, GORD.

367
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,504
HI, Mr RANGER GORD.

368
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,306
WE LOVE YOU.

369
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,179
WOMEN HAVE A THING FOR ME.

370
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:04,049
I HOPE SOME DAY I CAN ATTRACT
WOMEN THE WAY YOU DO,

371
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,685
MASTER RANGER GORD.

372
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,554
GET REAL.

373
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:10,756
UH, Mr RANGER GORD,

374
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,192
IS THAT STONE YOU'RE
SITTING ON ALSO
AN EGG, EH?

375
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,526
THAT IS CORRECT.

376
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,662
I AM ABOUT TO HATCH THIS EGG.

377
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:20,299
WELL, WHAT WILL THAT
STONE HATCH INTO?

378
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,768
THIS EGG WILL HATCH INTO

379
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:27,039
A BLACK HOLE, WHICH WILL DEVOUR
ALL IGNORANCE FROM MILES AROUND.

380
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:36,882
YOU SEE, BOYS AND GIRLS?

381
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,183
IGNORANCE IS BLISS.

382
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,886
UNTIL A STONE HATCHES INTO A
BLACK HOLE, THAT IS.

383
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,755
[laughing]

384
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,305
DO GO OUT ON A DATE,

385
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:01,773
YOU KNOW,
LIKE, EVER?

386
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,343
OH, YEAH, ACTUALLY,
I GOT A DATE TONIGHT.

387
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:07,279
SO WHERE ARE YOU GOING
ON THIS HOT DATE, ANYWAY?

388
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:08,914
OH, THE MOVIES.

389
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,282
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

390
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,817
IT'S CHEAP NIGHT AT
THE MOVIES, EH?

391
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,252
TWO GET IN FOR
THE PRICE OF ONE.

392
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,720
THAT'S GOOD THINKING.

393
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,688
WELL, SHE USUALLY
PAYS FOR HERSELF.

394
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:17,990
I DON'T MIND.

395
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,025
ACTUALLY, SHE'LL PROBABLY
PAY FOR BOTH OF US.

396
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,027
SHE MAKES MORE
MONEY THAN I DO.

397
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:23,562
I DON'T THINK
THAT MATTERS, DALE.

398
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,364
I MEAN, YOU ASKED HER OUT.
SHE'S YOUR GUEST.

399
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,267
NO, SHE ASKED ME OUT.

400
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,035
SHE ASKED YOU OUT?

401
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,837
SHE PHONED YOU
AND ASKED YOU OUT?

402
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,138
YEAH.

403
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,439
SHE JUST COMES UP
TO YOU AND SAYS,

404
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,842
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU AND I
GO OUT AND PAINT THE TOWN,

405
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,710
LIKE SHE'S THE GUY
AND YOU'RE THE GIRL?

406
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:41,013
RIGHT.

407
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:44,483
YOU'VE GOT TO PROVE TO HER
THAT YOU CAN SHOW HER
A GOOD TIME.

408
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,385
LIKE, OF ALL THE
GUYS IN THE WORLD,

409
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:49,521
SHE'S GOTTA FEEL LIKE SHE'S
LUCKY TO BE WITH YOU.

410
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,623
DON'T YOU GET IT?
ISN'T THAT IMPORTANT TO YOU?

411
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,592
NOPE.

412
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,194
OH, MAN!

413
00:19:56,328 --> 00:20:00,098
GET AWAY FROM THOSE TREASURES,
YOU MARTIAN PIGS!

414
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:03,569
YOU WANT MORE OF THIS, DO YOU?

415
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,737
YOU WANNA A PIECE OF ME?!

416
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:10,275
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED?

417
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:11,777
COME ON!

418
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,445
COME ON!

419
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:16,815
HEY, SHOULDN'T YOU CLOSE THE
WINDOWS BEFORE YOU BEAT THE
CRAP OUT OF THE COMPUTER?

420
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,551
RED, THE POWER'S GONE OFF.

421
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:20,819
CAN'T YOU DO SOMETHING?

422
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,254
WELL, I CAN DO LOTS
OF THINGS, DALTON.

423
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,555
THE SUN IS SHINING.
I CAN GO BOATING.

424
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:26,124
I CAN GO FISHING.
I CAN GO HIKING.

425
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,328
TURN THE POWER ON!
I WAS ON LEVEL FOUR.

426
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,263
I THINK YOU PROBABLY
JUST BLEW THE FUSE HERE.

427
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,298
YEAH, YEAH,
YOU GOT --

428
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,801
GEEZ, DALTON, I HAVEN'T
GOT ANY SPARES.

429
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,903
YOU GOT A COIN?

430
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,439
NO, I HAVEN'T
GOT A COIN!

431
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,107
WELL, GET ME ONE
OF THOSE PLUMS.

432
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,775
I LEARNED ON THE INTERNET THAT
THEY CONDUCT ELECTRICITY.

433
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,980
THAT'S IT!
YOU SEE?

434
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:50,349
I HOPE IT'S
RIGHT-HAND THREAD.

435
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,452
[explosion]

436
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:09,568
THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.

437
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,069
NO.

438
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,506
RED, YOU WRECKED
THE COMPUTER.

439
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,575
NO, NO, NO,
YOU DID IT, DALTON.

440
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,310
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
PICKED SUCH A BIG PLUM.

441
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,045
TOO MUCH JUICE.

442
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,748
[possum squealing]

443
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,249
MEETING TIME.

444
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,351
YEAH, YOU GO AHEAD,
Mr GATES.

445
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,253
I'LL BE DOWN
IN A MINUTE.

446
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:29,855
SO IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

447
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,490
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT
HOME AFTER THE MEETING.

448
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:33,525
AND, YES, I KNOW
IT'S THE COMPUTER AGE,

449
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:35,594
BUT LET'S NOT FORGET ABOUT
PERSONAL INTERACTION.

450
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:38,930
WHEN I GET HOME,
I WANNA SHOW YOU THAT
I'M USER FRIENDLY.

451
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,035
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

452
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:45,370
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND
THE WHOLE GANG UP HERE
AT POSSUM LODGE,

453
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,739
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

EVERYBODY GO SIT DOWN NOW.

456
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,383
GO SIT DOWN.

457

EVERYBODY SIT DOWN.
SIT DOWN, EVERYBODY.

458
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:02,220
YOU GOTTA SIT DOWN.

459
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,390
ALL RISE!

460
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,595
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI. 

461
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,731
SIT DOWN.

462
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:15,867
ALL RIGHT, AND BOW YOUR HEADS
FOR THE MAN'S PRAYER.

463
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:18,570
I'M A MAN,
BUT I CAN CHANGE,

464
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:22,107
IF I HAVE TO,
I GUESS.
