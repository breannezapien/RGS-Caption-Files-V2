00:15:12,176 --> 00:15:14,812
I think you need
to play it as a young man.

314
00:15:14,812 --> 00:15:17,748
I think it may possibly be
a young man's --

315
00:15:17,748 --> 00:15:19,149
it might be a
young man's game.

316
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:24,121
I think takin' the game up
at 50 is probably kinda dumb.

317
00:15:24,121 --> 00:15:28,325
And you know, it's not
as easy as it looks.

318
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:30,227
So I had an idea.

319
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:31,795
I just tried to
help Bill up,

320
00:15:31,795 --> 00:15:33,530
or he tried to
help me down --

321
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,934
I'm not sure how that --
I'll just tow you.

322
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:40,103
So the idea was that I would
duct tape the hockey stick

323
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:42,005
to the handle of the pump
and we'd get a little
more leverage,

324
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:45,209
'cause what I wanted to do
was really over-inflate
this ball.

325
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:48,078
I wanted the balls to be a
little bit larger.

326
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:50,113
Uh, you know, I may possibly
have overdone it a bit

327
00:15:50,113 --> 00:15:51,448
on the size of the ball.

328
00:15:51,448 --> 00:15:55,285
Now we're both afraid
it's gonna blow,

329
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:57,521
and it was the
pump that went.

330
00:15:57,521 --> 00:15:59,823
We got a great idea;
we got the ball out there.

331
00:15:59,823 --> 00:16:01,325
And the reason that
we need such a big ball

332
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:03,160
is that we're not
gonna kick this ball.

333
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,029
It's not soccer,
it's soc-car

334
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:08,532
Now you're talkin'.

335
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:10,567
All right,
so this is my goal.

336
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:12,970
I get down to this end,
and here we go!

337
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,504
Down the other end.

338
00:16:14,504 --> 00:16:16,373
And Bill reaches
for the trunk button.

339
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:18,942
And bang!
Up and over.

340
00:16:18,942 --> 00:16:22,913
I go down, and I come out
the back end of the van,

341
00:16:22,913 --> 00:16:25,515
And then he's got
the door goin' good.

342
00:16:25,515 --> 00:16:27,617
And he hit the post!

343
00:16:27,617 --> 00:16:30,087
And then he hits her
again -- shoots her again.

344
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:32,122
We have very poor
defence on our team.

345
00:16:32,122 --> 00:16:34,291
And he still keeps
hitting that post.

346
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,360
So I come up, and I've got
the hockey stick on the door,

347
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,861
and I give her
a good banger,

348
00:16:37,861 --> 00:16:39,162
and up she goes.

349
00:16:39,162 --> 00:16:41,398
And now he grabs the hood
release and flips
her backwards.

350
00:16:41,398 --> 00:16:43,333
A great shot!
Wow!

351
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,736
