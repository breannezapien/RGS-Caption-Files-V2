1
00:00:01,534 --> 00:00:04,537
I like the expression
“waist not want not”.

2
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:07,540
Or in Harold's case,
want not, you not.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,110
So I found a use for these
little slivers of soap

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,612
that are too small
to shower with.

5
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:14,314
These are a lot
like lodge members.

6
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:16,516
You always find one
at the end of a bar,

7
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,618
and it usually
gets thrown out.

8
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:20,620
But don't throw them out.

9
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,689
Instead, cut them
into little pieces

10
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,325
the same width as the legs
of your kitchen chairs.

11
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,227
And then stick them
on to the bottoms

12
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:30,330
with the handyman's
secret weapon.

13

See, these things
will stop the chairs

from scratching
your linoleum,

to authenticate
a painting.

And if you look
very closely,

you'll see that
this painting

123
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:36,802
has the same type of velvet
that was popular in France

this painting is a fake.

Now, then, the other one
is the true Rembrandt.

Another clue is his signature
down here in the corner.

you spell Rembrandt.

were written with

is called a gurney,

161
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:18,770
which is a medical expression
for horizontal wedgie.

162
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,539
The beauty
of this baby

163
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:21,907
is the adjustable height.

164
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:24,109
I'm gonna take her down
as far as she'll go

165
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:25,911
because that gives us
the lowest centre of gravity

166
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:27,746
and when the horizontal
wedgie kicks in,

167
00:07:27,746 --> 00:07:30,382
I won't have
as far to fall.

168
00:07:30,382 --> 00:07:32,451
Now, the reason for the
low centre of gravity

169
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,486
is because I'm
actually building

170
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:36,054
a self-propelled
vehicle out of this junk.

171
00:07:36,054 --> 00:07:37,723
If you already
figured that out,

172
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:39,624
you're startin'
to think like me,

173
00:07:39,624 --> 00:07:40,926
and you might wanna
warn your loved ones.

174
00:07:40,926 --> 00:07:42,894
Now, of course,
using the gurney tires

175
00:07:42,894 --> 00:07:44,496
as drive wheels
would be stupid.

176
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:47,399
So instead I'm going
with these high precision,

177
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:51,069
oversized rim
wheelchair racing tires.

178
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:53,939
Mount the wheelchair backwards
on one end of the gurney.

179
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:56,541
And make sure she's
on there good and solid.

180
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,944
Not only able
to handle high speeds,

181
00:07:58,944 --> 00:08:01,880
but also high speed
accidents.

182
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,283
Okay, got my drive
train all hooked up.

183
00:08:05,283 --> 00:08:07,185
A couple of
cordless drills

184
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:10,121
mounted on some I.V. stands
did the trick.

185
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:12,324
But I need a
little extra speed,

186
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:15,527
because if people see those
I.V. stands put-putting along

187
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:18,930
they'll start calling me
a slow drip.

188
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,132
See, the beauty of going
with electric drive

189
00:08:21,132 --> 00:08:24,369
is that it's real easy
to amp up the horsepower.

190
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:26,905
The drills have got
18 volt motors in them,

191
00:08:26,905 --> 00:08:31,109
but these emergency hospital
batteries are 24 volts each.

192
00:08:31,109 --> 00:08:34,079
Now, you may call
that too much juice,

193
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:36,948
I call it a good start.

194
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:39,084
I'm hooking the
batteries up in series

195
00:08:39,084 --> 00:08:41,219
so I'm actually
going to have 72 volts

196
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:43,288
running through the drills.

197
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:45,290
They'll go like stink,
but not for long,

198
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,825
which is fine with me.

199
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:50,161
It's the same prognosis
my doctor gave me.

200
00:08:50,161 --> 00:08:52,130
Now, for those
safety nuts out there,

201
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,700
I've got this anchor attached
to a chunk of surgical tubing.

202
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,837
That'll give me a soft
but effective braking system.

203
00:08:58,837 --> 00:09:00,739
I call it ABS,

204
00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:03,108
A Big Stretch.

205
00:09:03,108 --> 00:09:05,777
My wife just calls it BS.

206
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:12,083
You can blow up a bunch
of surgical gloves

207
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,152
and use 'em as air bags.

208
00:09:14,152 --> 00:09:16,087
And when they're
not in use,

209
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:19,657
of course, you'll keep 'em
in the glove compartment.

210
00:09:19,657 --> 00:09:22,394
Okay, we're just about
ready for our test drive.

211
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:24,462
I thought the
doctor's outfit

212
00:09:24,462 --> 00:09:26,498
would fit in nice with
the medical motif.

213
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:29,734
At my age, you don't get
to play doctor all that often.

214
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:31,736
Plus I figure if
things don't work out,

215
00:09:31,736 --> 00:09:34,572
the emergency room doctors
will probably give me
better treatment,

216
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:36,941
if they think
I'm one of them.

217
00:09:36,941 --> 00:09:38,410
Speaking of hospitals now,

218
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,145
it occurred to me
that brakes are fine,

219
00:09:40,145 --> 00:09:42,781
but steering might
also be a nice touch.

220
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:45,617
So I wired up this
cardiac defibrillator

221
00:09:45,617 --> 00:09:48,720
to control the amount of juice
going to each of my drills.

222
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,422
And I took off the voltage
regulator knob

223
00:09:51,422 --> 00:09:53,291
and replaced it
with a steering wheel.

224
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,160
so now when I turn right,

225
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,062
most of the electricity
goes to the right-side
defibrillator paddle

226
00:09:58,062 --> 00:10:01,099
and makes that drill
go faster, so I turn right --

227
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:02,534
no, that would be left.

228
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:03,868
Okay, no, turn left.

229
00:10:03,868 --> 00:10:05,537
All right, okay,
the steering's backwards,

230
00:10:05,537 --> 00:10:06,905
but I can remember that.

231
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:08,740
Our roads are
pretty straight anyway.

232
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,942
And that's how you make
an exciting vehicle

233
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:13,444
out of a bunch of
old hospital junk.

234
00:10:13,444 --> 00:10:15,113
The beauty
of this car is

235
00:10:15,113 --> 00:10:16,648
if you do get
into an accident,

236
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:19,083
you can actually treat
yourself until the
medics arrive.

237
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,119
So remember, if the women
don't find you handsome,

238
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:23,421
they should at least
find you handy.

239
00:10:23,421 --> 00:10:25,089
Clear!

240
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:11,235
We have a few father and son
businesses in our area.

241
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:14,172
You know, like
Jones and Son Heating.

242
00:11:14,172 --> 00:11:16,274
It's always
someone and son.

243
00:11:16,274 --> 00:11:18,176
Of course,
the someone has a name,

244
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:20,044
the son is just a son.

245
00:11:20,044 --> 00:11:22,847
You never see
Dad and Jones.

246
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:24,682
And when you're
the father

247
00:11:24,682 --> 00:11:26,384
it's probably natural
to want your son

248
00:11:26,384 --> 00:11:27,785
to follow you
into business.

249
00:11:27,785 --> 00:11:31,522
It's one of the many
downsides of success.

250
00:11:31,522 --> 00:11:34,258
But you should remember
that there are

251
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:36,260

rather be one of those.

You may think
he's like you,

but if he doesn't
share your taste

259

in music, TV, movies,
food or tattoos,

260
00:11:56,214 --> 00:11:58,916
is he gonna share
your taste in jobs?

261
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:01,552
Or maybe you just
want him to be like you.

such a hot idea.

Instead, let the kid
decide for himself.

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,809
That's a good sign.

317
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:07,278
Kind of a
dangerous sport for --

318
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:09,113
well, there you're
through now.

319
00:14:09,113 --> 00:14:10,748
And there's the skateboards.

320
00:14:10,748 --> 00:14:15,352
So Walter comes out and
Bill catches the downspout.

321
00:14:17,688 --> 00:14:20,357
They say most accidents
happen out home.

322
00:14:20,357 --> 00:14:23,560
That explains both of them.

323
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,563
So Walter's lookin'
at the clogged drainpipe.

324
00:14:26,563 --> 00:14:27,765
He's gonna blow it out.

325
00:14:27,765 --> 00:14:29,433
Oh!

326
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:32,536
She seems clear
as a bell now.

327
00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:35,406
So he apologizes to Bill
and gets cleaned up.

328
00:14:35,406 --> 00:14:38,108
And Walter notices
the entire eavestrough

329
00:14:38,108 --> 00:14:41,045
is just covered with leaves
and twigs and what have you

330
00:14:41,045 --> 00:14:43,447
from many, many seasons.

331
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:45,916
So they're thinking maybe
they should clean out
the eavestroughs,

332
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,918
and they can probably
combine the hobby

333
00:14:47,918 --> 00:14:49,520
with the job.

334
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,722
Use the skateboards
on a ladder.

335
00:14:51,722 --> 00:14:54,058
So they can roll
the ladder along

336
00:14:54,058 --> 00:14:55,726
and they can clean out the
eavestrough as they go,

337
00:14:55,726 --> 00:14:58,762
but Walter misunderstood
and put it on his end, so --

338
00:14:58,762 --> 00:15:02,433
Now you've got what we
like to call a double ender.

339
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:05,235
And so get her up
towards the roof there.

340
00:15:05,235 --> 00:15:07,171
And easy now,
Bill, easy, easy.

341
00:15:07,171 --> 00:15:10,641
Easy, easy.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

342
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:14,445
Probably just as well
he doesn't have kids anyway.

343
00:15:14,445 --> 00:15:16,513
So he gets it in place

344
00:15:16,513 --> 00:15:18,315
Yeah, you're good,
you're great.

345
00:15:18,315 --> 00:15:20,284
Yeah, we understand,
we get it.

346
00:15:20,284 --> 00:15:21,652
We get it, boys.

347
00:15:21,652 --> 00:15:23,253
Oh, isn't that
just peachy?

348
00:15:23,253 --> 00:15:25,456
Okay, so Walter goes
up the ladder and the idea is

349
00:15:25,456 --> 00:15:28,459
if he takes one of those
small little garden shovels

350
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:30,427
he can stick that
in the eavestrough.

351
00:15:30,427 --> 00:15:32,196
And Bill will just
slide the unit along,

352
00:15:32,196 --> 00:15:34,998
and it'll clean out the
eavestrough as they go.

353
00:15:34,998 --> 00:15:37,234
And it's working
real good.

354
00:15:37,234 --> 00:15:39,703
But then, uh,
Walter drops the shovel.

355
00:15:39,703 --> 00:15:41,905
Bill doesn't see it,
and he trips on it,

356
00:15:41,905 --> 00:15:43,807
and he pushes the ladder.

357
00:15:43,807 --> 00:15:45,709
The next thing you know,

358
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:48,412
Walter's pickin' up
speed here.
