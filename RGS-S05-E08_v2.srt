1
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:06,773
(Medieval melody plays)

2
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:10,810
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW".

3
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,279
HERE'S THE MAN WHO'S
AS MUCH A PART OF THE NORTH

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,914
AS TREE SAP AND MOOSE DROPPINGS,

5
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:16,549
YOUR HERO, MY UNCLE,

6
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:18,384
RED GREEN.

7
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:19,986
(Cheering)

8
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,357
WOO!

9
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:25,625
WOO!

10
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,127
(Applause)

11
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:29,395
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

12
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:31,331
MY WIFE DRAGGED ME TO

13
00:00:31,397 --> 00:00:32,966
THE POSSUM LAKE LITTLE THEATRE.

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,201
THEY WERE DOING "CAMELOT".

15
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:37,003
IT'S SMART TO DO A MUSICAL.

16
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:37,971
WHILE YOU'RE SITTING THERE

17
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:39,272
THINKING THEY CAN'T SING,

18
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:41,975
YOU FORGET THEY CAN'T ACT.

19
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,576
"CAMELOT", I LOVE THAT!

20
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:45,078
(Singing) CAMELOT

21
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:48,648
I KNOW IT MAY SOUND
A BIT BIZARRE

22
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,217
YOU DON'T JUST SOUND BIZARRE,
HAROLD.

23
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:53,119
BUT YOU KNOW,
WHILE I'M SITTING THERE,

24
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:54,687
I'M THINKING, IN A WAY

25
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:57,590
POSSUM LODGE IS
KIND OF OUR CAMELOT.

26
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:59,158
WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT

27
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,295
TO DRESS UP
AS KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE

28
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:05,265
AND FORCE PEOPLE
TO BECOME CHRISTIANS?

29
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,267
YEAH, YEAH, BECAUSE THEY WORE

30
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,501
ARMOUR AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

31
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:10,470
THEY HAD, LIKE, CHAIN MAIL.

32
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:14,540
I GOT A CHAIN LETTER ONCE,
BUT THAT'S A LOT DIFFERENT.

33
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,075
JUST IGNORE HIM. IT'S NOT RUDE.

34
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:17,911
IT'S SAVING HIS LIFE.

35
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,281
STAY TUNED AND WATCH
MIDDLE-AGED GUYS

36
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:22,749
RECREATE THE MIDDLE AGES.

37
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:25,118
(Singing) IF EVER
I WOULD LEAVE YOU

38
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:27,453
DON'T TEASE
ME, HAROLD.

39
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,629
(Geese honking)

40
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:40,633
(Quacking)

41
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:45,071
(Red): IF I HAVE TO
EXPLAIN THIS,

42
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:46,839
WE'LL BE HERE ALL EVENING.

43
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:50,843
WE DO HAVE EDGAR MONTROSE
TRYING TO HEAR.

44
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:55,348
I'LL LAY A LITTLE PEACE SIGN
ON BUZZ SHERWOOD.

45
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:58,651
I'LL BUILD A CROSSBOW
THAT PUTS HAIR ON YOUR CHEST.

46
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:05,525
OLD LADY BENKMAN,
PRINCIPAL OF THE SCHOOL,

47
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:08,294
HAS OFFERED US
THEIR OLD SPORTS EQUIPMENT.

48
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:11,464
SHE'S HOPING TO PARTICIPATE
IN OUR MEDIEVAL DAY.

49
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,433
SHE WANTS TO PLAY GUINEVERE.

50
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:17,236
SHE'S A LIGHT ON THE GUINE,
BUT SHE'S HEAVY ON THE VERE.

51
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,572
I DON'T THINK
USED SPORTS EQUIPMENT

52
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,708
IS THE BEST IDEA TO
REPRESENT THE MIDDLE AGES,

53
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,744
UNLESS I'M MISSING SOMETHING.

54
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,746
YOU'RE GONNA BE, HAROLD.

55
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,481
HOW ABOUT PURPLE HORSES?

56
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:31,317
DO YOU THINK WE COULD USE
PURPLE HORSES AT ALL?

57
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,819
PURPLE HORSES?

58
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:35,454
THE SCHOOL BOARD
HAS PURPLE HORSES?

59
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:37,557
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN
THE MEAT IN THE CAFETERIA.

60
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:40,993
THAT SAYS "POMMEL HORSES,"
UNCLE RED.

61
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,261
WE COULD USE THAT.

62
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:45,097
WHAT ABOUT THIS
THE LONG POLE VAULT THING?

63
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:46,599
PARALLEL BARS.

64
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,735
THAT'S HOW I SPRAINED
MY ARMPITS.

65
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,771
YEAH.

66
00:02:51,837 --> 00:02:54,273
I HATE GYM.

67
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,510
(Red): IN KEEPING WITH
OUR MEDIEVAL TIMES THEME,

68
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,812
BILL WILL HAVE
A LESSON ON FENCING.

69
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,914
KIND OF
A DELICATE FRENCH THING.

70
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:03,783
UH-OH! -- VERY GOOD.

71
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:05,785
ALMOST LIKE A BALLET.

72
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:07,720
VERY, VERY DIGNIFIED.

73
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:10,890
UNFORTUNATELY,
I'M NOT FROM FRANCE.

74
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,092
HERE WE ARE WITH BUZZ SHERWOOD

75
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,595
TO PLAY
THE POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME.

76
00:03:15,661 --> 00:03:19,298
IS THIS THE PART WHERE
I FILL UP THE SHOPPING CART?

77
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,800
NO.

78
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:23,002
TODAY'S PRIZE IS
THREE BOTTLES OF

79
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,806
POSSUM HILLS DRINKING WATER
AND A PAIR OF RUNNING SHOES.

80
00:03:26,872 --> 00:03:28,708
HAROLD, GIVE ME THE WORD.

81
00:03:28,774 --> 00:03:31,811
I'LL SHOW THE FOLKS AT HOME
WHAT IT SAYS.

82
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:35,314
BUZZ, YOU GOT 30 SECONDS
TO SAY THIS WORD.

83
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,816
LET'S DO IT.

84
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:38,818
UH, HARMONY.

85
00:03:38,884 --> 00:03:40,319
BAD MUSIC!

86
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,821
TRANQUILLITY.

87
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:44,590
OO, OO, AH, HIDING PLACE!

88
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,258
WAR AND...

89
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:47,760
COMMISSION.

90
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,261
COMMISSION?

91
00:03:49,328 --> 00:03:52,765
THE WARREN COMMISSION --
IT WAS SUCH A CROCK.

92
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:55,267
OSWALD
COULDN'T HAVE BEEN ALONE!

93
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:56,769
TWO BEERS.

94
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,270
CLOSING TIME!

95
00:03:58,337 --> 00:04:00,473
LIVE LONG AND PROSPER,
MR. SPOCK.

96
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:02,775
WHAT DOES THE MINISTER
SAY TO YOU?

97
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,276
ADULTERY IS A SIN.

98
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:08,347
REMEMBER ABOUT A MONTH AGO,
THE COPS PULLED YOU OVER.

99
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,782
WHAT DID THEY SAY?

100
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,751
YOU CAN CALL FLYING YOUR PLANE
THROUGH A MALL

101
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:14,253
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION,

102
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,789
BUT WE CALL THAT
DISTURBING THE PEACE.

103
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,357
THAT'S THE ONE!

104
00:04:18,357 --> 00:04:19,658
(Strums acoustic guitar)

105
00:04:19,658 --> 00:04:22,728
LIFE IS LIKE A RIVER

106
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,998
IT WINDS AND EBBS
AND FLOWS

107
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,834
IT CARRIES YOU ALONG
FOR QUITE AWHILE

108
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,903
THEN IT SHOOTS WATER
UP YOUR NOSE

109
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,507
LIFE IS LIKE A RIVER

110
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:36,108
NOTHING SCHEDULED

111
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:38,077
NOTHING PLANNED

112
00:04:38,143 --> 00:04:41,313
YOU CRUISE ALONG
AS FAR AS YOU CAN

113
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,983
AND AT THE END
YOU'RE PROBABLY DAMMED

114
00:04:46,485 --> 00:04:47,920
WITH THE LODGE INTO

115
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,922
A MIDDLE-AGES FRAME OF MIND,

116
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,757
I'LL TAKE HANDYMAN CORNER

117
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:55,461
AND BUILD SOMETHING APPROPRIATE
FOR THE AGE OF CHIVALRY.

118
00:04:55,527 --> 00:04:57,763
REMEMBER THAT SHOW "ROBIN HOOD"?

119
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,265
YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVED?

120
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:03,269
THE WAY THEY'D SEND MESSAGES
BY ATTACHING THEM TO AN ARROW

121
00:05:03,335 --> 00:05:07,239
AND SHOOTING THEM
INTO A TREE OR A PEASANT'S BACK.

122
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:09,742
WHY DON'T WE USE
THAT TECHNOLOGY

123
00:05:09,808 --> 00:05:12,511
TO SEND PACKAGES
THROUGH THE WOODS?

124
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,546
SORT OF A COURIER DE BOIS.

125
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:16,515
IF THAT MAKES YOU BLANCH,

126
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:19,251
THEN MAYBE YOU'RE
A BLANCHE DUBOIS.

127
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:20,786
OR A T.V. CRITIC.

128
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:23,622
FIRST THING YOU NEED
IS A POLE VAULT POLE

129
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:25,124
TO USE AS YOUR BOW.

130
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,760
I GOT THIS FROM
THE POSSUM LAKE SCHOOL,

131
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:29,728
BUT YOU CAN GET ONE FOR FREE

132
00:05:29,795 --> 00:05:32,564
BY STANDING NEXT TO
THE POLE VAULT EVENT.

133
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:35,601
AS THE GUY GOES OVER,
HE'LL LET GO OF THE POLE.

134
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:38,537
YOU'LL BE MILES AWAY
BY THE TIME HE COMES TO,

135
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:42,408
WHEN HE LANDS ON THE GROUND,
'CAUSE THE CUSHION GOT MOVED,

136
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:44,209
YOU KNOW, BY SOMEBODY.

137
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:47,279
YOU'LL NEED SOME KIND OF
A BOW STRING.

138
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:50,416
YOU COULD USE A ROPE
OR A GARDEN HOSE.

139
00:05:50,482 --> 00:05:53,752
BUT I SUGGEST FAN BELTS
OUT OF YOUR CAR.

140
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:57,322
OR BETTER YET, FAN BELTS
FROM YOUR FRIENDS' CARS.

141
00:05:57,389 --> 00:05:59,057
SURE, THEY'LL BE TICKED

142
00:05:59,124 --> 00:06:02,428
WHEN THEIR CARS ARE
BOILING OVER ALL THE TIME.

143
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:06,265
BUT VEHICLES DON'T BELONG
IN THE MIDDLE AGES,

144
00:06:06,331 --> 00:06:08,467
EXCEPT MAYBE BUSTER'S EDSEL.

145
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,003
WE'LL NEED AN ARROW
FOR THIS RIG.

146
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:12,504
I SUGGEST A SHOVEL,

147
00:06:12,571 --> 00:06:16,475
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'LL BE
SENDING GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS.

148
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,510
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

149
00:06:18,577 --> 00:06:20,579
"HOW WILL ONE GUY BE ABLE TO

150
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:23,715
WORK THIS HUGE BOW AND ARROW
ALL BY HIMSELF?

151
00:06:23,782 --> 00:06:27,853
WELL, THAT'S A LITTLE SURPRISE
I'VE BEEN SAVING FOR YOU.

152
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:33,158
I'M NOT JUST BUILDING A BOW.

153
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:36,862
(Squeaking)

154
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:42,467
I'M BUILDING A CROSSBOW.

155
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:47,472
NOW, WITH A BOAT TRAILER,

156
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:50,175
YOU GET THE PERFECT ANGLE
FOR LAUNCHING.

157
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:52,044
WITH HER MOUNTED ON WHEELS,

158
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,180
YOU HAVE THE FULL
390 DEGREE RANGE FOR AIMING.

159
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:58,550
NOW, WHAT YOU DO IS
GET YOURSELF A PIECE OF ROPE,

160
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:00,018
TIE IT TO THE BOW LINE,

161
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:03,121
AND THEN JUST HOOK YOUR WINCH
RIGHT ON THERE.

162
00:07:03,188 --> 00:07:04,690
AND CRANK HER BACK.

163
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,730
(Humming)

164
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:17,269
(Groaning)

165
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,837
THERE WE GO.

166
00:07:18,904 --> 00:07:20,739
WE HAVE TO ADAPT THE HANDLE

167
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:23,241
SO THAT SHE'LL HOOK ONTO
THE BOW LINE.

168
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:24,776
JUST PULL THAT OUT

169
00:07:30,382 --> 00:07:31,883
NO, NO.

170
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:37,723
WE'VE GOT TO ATTACH SOMETHING
TO THE SHOVEL

171
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:39,391
TO CARRY THE PARCELS.

172
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,794
YOU COULD USE A LUNCH PAIL,
A BREAD BOX.

173
00:07:44,796 --> 00:07:46,231
I PREFER A BEDPAN.

174
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:47,732
IT'S LIGHT, AERODYNAMIC,

175
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:51,169
AND IT PREPARES THE RECEIVER
FOR BAD NEWS.

176
00:07:51,236 --> 00:07:53,371
NO NEWS IS GOOD NEWS.

177
00:07:53,438 --> 00:07:57,742
ALL RIGHT, JUST GOING TO AIM
THIS UP TO BRAXTON'S MARINA,

178
00:07:57,809 --> 00:08:00,579
'CAUSE I'VE GOT THIS
ELECTRONIC IGNITION

179
00:08:00,645 --> 00:08:03,181
THAT I HAVE TO RETURN
OR PAY FOR IT.

180
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:05,350
NOW, TO SEND OUR PACKAGE,

181
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:08,253
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS
CUT THE TWINE.

182
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,456
YOU COULD TIE A SPOOL OF THREAD
ONTO THE SHOVEL

183
00:08:11,523 --> 00:08:13,758
AND YOU COULD
TRACE YOUR PACKAGE.

184
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:15,260
THERE WE HAVE IT.

185
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:17,762
THE POSSUM LAKE
MEDIEVAL COURIER SERVICE,

186
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:20,999
WHEN IT ABSOLUTELY HAS TO
GET THERE OVER WATER.

187
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:24,069
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

188
00:08:24,135 --> 00:08:25,937
AND I'M GUESSING THEY DON'T,

189
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:28,273
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

190
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,775
FORE!

191
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:33,745
(Crashing)

192
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:35,247
SORRY!

193
00:08:35,313 --> 00:08:36,748
AH.

194
00:08:36,815 --> 00:08:38,250
(Red): BE THERE

195
00:08:38,316 --> 00:08:40,852
WHEN RANGER GORD DISCOVERS
ANOTHER PHOBIA.

196
00:08:45,523 --> 00:08:48,526
SOMETIME YOU'LL BE
AT A SOCIAL FUNCTION

197
00:08:48,593 --> 00:08:53,231
WHEN ONE OR TWO YOUNGER WOMEN
WILL START FLIRTING WITH YOU.

198
00:08:53,298 --> 00:08:57,535
THEY'LL PAT YOUR BALD HEAD,
LAUGH AT YOUR CORNY JOKES,

199
00:08:57,602 --> 00:09:02,574
MAYBE PLAYFULLY SIT IN YOUR LAP
OR GET YOU ON THE DANCE FLOOR.

200
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:04,075
MAKE YOU FEEL ALIVE?

201
00:09:04,142 --> 00:09:06,578
MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE
A PISTOL AGAIN?

202
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:08,079
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.

203
00:09:08,146 --> 00:09:10,582
YOU ARE OFFICIALLY
AN OLD GEEZER.

204
00:09:10,648 --> 00:09:12,584
(Laughing)

205
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,085
YEAH, YOU.

206
00:09:14,152 --> 00:09:15,587
I'M TALKING TO YOU.

207
00:09:15,653 --> 00:09:17,422
THAT'S THE FIRST SIGN.

208
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:21,526
THOSE WOMEN ARE FAWNING YOU
BECAUSE THEY THINK IT'S CUTE

209
00:09:21,593 --> 00:09:24,396
TO SEE SOMEONE YOUR AGE
DOING THE FRUG.

210
00:09:24,462 --> 00:09:26,297
THINK OF WHO ELSE WAS THERE.

211
00:09:26,364 --> 00:09:29,934
A BUNCH OF YOUNG GUYS WITH
TESTOSTERONE IN THEIR EYES,

212
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:31,936
AND ONE THING ON THEIR MIND.

213
00:09:32,003 --> 00:09:35,106
WHEREAS YOU ARE OLD
AND FUN AND SAFE.

214
00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:37,609
IT'S NOT BAD
BEING AN OLD GEEZER.

215
00:09:37,675 --> 00:09:39,277
DID YOU HAVE FUN?

216
00:09:39,344 --> 00:09:42,447
DID YOU ENJOY BEING
THE CENTRE OF ATTENTION?

217
00:09:42,514 --> 00:09:43,948
SURE YOU DID.

218
00:09:44,015 --> 00:09:46,885
WHILE YOU'RE RUBBING
LINIMENT INTO YOUR JOINTS,

219
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:48,486
YOU'VE GOT THE MEMORY.

220
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:52,123
I'M PULLING FOR YOU 'CAUSE
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER,

221
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,625
YOU OLD GEEZER!

222
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:55,960
(Applause)

223
00:09:56,027 --> 00:09:59,864
ON BEHALF OF OUR VIEWERS
AND MANKIND IN GENERAL,

224
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:03,635
WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU
DOING HERE, RANGER GORD?

225
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:05,170
HERE'S MY IDEA.

226
00:10:05,236 --> 00:10:08,907
AFTER A RAIN,
THE FIRE DANGER IS LOW.

227
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:11,809
SO I'M BUILDING
A SPRINKLER SYSTEM

228
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:13,311
FOR THE FOREST.

229
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:15,480
A SPRINKLER SYSTEM
IN THE FOREST.

230
00:10:15,547 --> 00:10:17,649
IT'S MANDATORY
IN MOST BUILDINGS,

231
00:10:17,715 --> 00:10:20,084
ñ WHY SHOULDN'T IT BE
IN THE FOREST.

232
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:22,387
I'M DRILLING OUT
THESE OLD BRANCHES

233
00:10:22,453 --> 00:10:25,056
TO USE AS PIPES
TO CARRY THE WATER ALONG.

234
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:28,092
I'M USING PINE CONES
AS SPRINKLERS.

235
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:31,596
GORD, DID YOU EVER THINK
THERE'S A TIME LIMIT

236
00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:35,099
ON HOW LONG A PERSON
SHOULD BE A FOREST RANGER?

237
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,601
NO, NO WAY.

238
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:40,605
NOT FROM ME, RED, BECAUSE
AS SMOKEY THE BEAR ONCE SAID,

239
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:43,041
"ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT
FOREST FIRES."

240
00:10:43,107 --> 00:10:44,943
HE SAID THAT TO ME ONE DAY.

241
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:47,745
I REMEMBER THE DAY
LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.

242
00:10:47,812 --> 00:10:49,314
I WAS IN THE BASEMENT.

243
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,918
I TURNED ON MY 26-INCH ADMIRAL
AND THERE WAS SMOKEY THE BEAR,

244
00:10:53,985 --> 00:10:56,754
LOOKED ME STRAIGHT IN THE EYE
AND SAID

245
00:10:56,821 --> 00:10:59,457
"ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT
FOREST FIRES."

246
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:00,825
I SAID, "YES, SIR."

247
00:11:00,892 --> 00:11:04,195
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BURDEN
TO LAY ON A 9 YEAR OLD,

248
00:11:04,262 --> 00:11:07,932
ESPECIALLY SINCE I DIDN'T WANT
TO PREVENT FOREST FIRES.

249
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:09,934
I WANTED TO STUDY MEDICINE.

250
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:13,438
BUT WHEN A BEAR SENDS
A PERSONAL MESSAGE TO YOU,

251
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:15,640
YOU'D BETTER DARN WELL LISTEN.

252
00:11:15,707 --> 00:11:19,143
GORD, I THINK THAT'S
MORE OF A SLOGAN, ACTUALLY.

253
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,645
SORRY, WHAT?

254
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:24,916
SMOKEY THE BEAR SAID "ONLY YOU
CAN PREVENT FOREST FIRES"

255
00:11:24,982 --> 00:11:27,351
IN EVERY COMMERCIAL
HE EVER DID.

256
00:11:27,418 --> 00:11:28,886
IT WAS HIS SCHTICK.

257
00:11:28,953 --> 00:11:31,089
SO IT WASN'T A MESSAGE TO ME?

258
00:11:31,155 --> 00:11:32,590
OH, GOSH NO.

259
00:11:32,657 --> 00:11:34,092
NO, NO.

260
00:11:34,158 --> 00:11:35,593
WHAT, WHAT?

261
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,596
I COULD HAVE STUDIED MEDICINE.

262
00:11:38,663 --> 00:11:40,098
YEAH, UH...

263
00:11:40,164 --> 00:11:41,599
ALL RIGHT.

264
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,601
YOU KNOW, GORD, WAIT A MINUTE.

265
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:45,102
COME ON BACK.

266
00:11:45,169 --> 00:11:47,405
THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY.

267
00:11:47,472 --> 00:11:50,942
YOU'RE SAVING A LOT MORE LIVES
AS A FOREST RANGER

268
00:11:51,008 --> 00:11:53,611
THAN YOU EVER WOULD HAVE
AS A DOCTOR.

269
00:11:53,678 --> 00:11:56,714
BUT I HAVEN'T SAVED
A SINGLE LIFE HERE.

270
00:11:56,781 --> 00:11:58,616
BUT YOU'RE STILL AHEAD.

271
00:11:58,683 --> 00:12:00,585
YEAH.

272
00:12:00,651 --> 00:12:02,887
THIS MEDIEVAL DAY
IS TURNING INTO

273
00:12:02,954 --> 00:12:06,991
THE MOST EDUCATIONAL EVENT
WE'VE EVER HAD AT POSSUM LODGE,

274
00:12:07,058 --> 00:12:08,893
WHICH ISN'T ALL THAT HARD.

275
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,294
WHERE'S YOUR ARMOUR?

276
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:11,696
THE PAINT'S
DRYING.

277
00:12:11,762 --> 00:12:15,233
THOSE HOCKEY PADS
REALLY SOAK UP THE PRIMER.

278
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:17,235
I HOPE THE HORSES AREN'T HURT.

279
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:19,070
WE'RE NOT USING HORSES.

280
00:12:19,136 --> 00:12:21,072
WE BOLTED POMMEL HORSES

281
00:12:21,138 --> 00:12:22,807
TO K-CARS.

282
00:12:22,873 --> 00:12:27,178
HORSES WERE GOOD ENOUGH
FOR KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE.

283
00:12:27,245 --> 00:12:29,347
WE NEED MORE HORSEPOWER.

284
00:12:29,413 --> 00:12:31,849
THE WIVES ARE DOING UP
A GROANING BOARD,

285
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,351
BUT, NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THAT IS.

286
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:35,820
OH YEAH,
IT'S A GROANING BOARD.

287
00:12:35,886 --> 00:12:37,321
SURE, I KNOW, YEAH.

288
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:39,457
IT'S A BOARD AND IT GROANS.

289
00:12:39,523 --> 00:12:41,826
YOU GOT A GROANING
AND A BOARD.

290
00:12:41,892 --> 00:12:43,594
IT'S A GROANING BOARD.

291
00:12:43,661 --> 00:12:46,497
AS I SAY,
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THAT IS.

292
00:12:46,564 --> 00:12:50,167
I FIGURE ANYTHING THAT
USES FOOD AND INVOLVES

293
00:12:50,234 --> 00:12:52,770
THE WORD "GROANING"
SOUNDS GOOD.

294
00:12:52,837 --> 00:12:55,539
I NEVER THOUGHT HISTORY
WAS THIS EXCITING.

295
00:12:55,606 --> 00:12:58,109
I THOUGHT HISTORY WAS
JUST DEAD PEOPLE.

296
00:12:58,175 --> 00:12:59,844
WELL, IT'S EARLY YET.

297
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:03,314
YOU KNOW, RANGER GORD,

298
00:13:03,381 --> 00:13:07,451
YOU LIVING, EATING AND SLEEPING
UP IN THE TOWER FOR 16 YEARS,

299
00:13:07,518 --> 00:13:10,121
YOU EVER SUFFER FROM
ACROPHOBIA AT ALL?

300
00:13:10,187 --> 00:13:11,622
WHAT'S THAT, RED?

301
00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:13,124
FEAR OF HEIGHTS.

302
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,625
HEIGHTS?

303
00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:17,628
OH NO --
I'M NOT REALLY THAT HIGH HERE.

304
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,130
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

305
00:13:19,196 --> 00:13:20,631
OH, OH.

306
00:13:20,698 --> 00:13:22,133
HELP ME.

307
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:23,567
IT'S TOO HIGH.

308
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:26,070
NO, NO, ONLY 200 TO 300 FEET.

309
00:13:26,137 --> 00:13:27,571
I'M TOO HIGH.

310
00:13:27,638 --> 00:13:29,073
NO, YOU'RE FINE.

311
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,574
I'M TOO HIGH.

312
00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:32,576
I'M TOO HIGH.

313
00:13:32,643 --> 00:13:34,078
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

314
00:13:34,145 --> 00:13:35,579
I'M TOO HIGH.

315
00:13:35,646 --> 00:13:37,081
WE'RE ON TELEVISION.

316
00:13:37,148 --> 00:13:39,083
WE'RE ON TELEVISION HERE.

317
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,085
YOU'RE CRYING ON MY SHOE.

318
00:13:41,152 --> 00:13:42,586
YEAH.

319
00:13:42,653 --> 00:13:44,088
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S FINE.

320
00:13:44,155 --> 00:13:47,591
WHEN YOU LOOK BACK INTO
MEDIEVAL HISTORY,

321
00:13:47,658 --> 00:13:50,961
THERE'S A LOT OF POMP
AND CIRCUMSTANCE.

322
00:13:51,028 --> 00:13:53,230
THAT'S WHAT WE WANTED TO
RECREATE.

323
00:13:53,297 --> 00:13:55,599
THIS IS A NORMAL WAY
OF STARTING...

324
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,101
OF STARTING A...

325
00:13:57,167 --> 00:14:00,104
THAT WOULD GET ON YOUR NERVES,
WOULDN'T IT?

326
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,605
MM-HMM.

327
00:14:01,672 --> 00:14:03,107
UH-HUH, YEAH.

328
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:05,609
THAT'S MY WAY OF

329
00:14:05,676 --> 00:14:07,478
THROWING DOWN THE GAUNTLET.

330
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:10,881
THIS SETS UP A SWORD FIGHT
OR A DUEL OF SOME KIND.

331
00:14:10,948 --> 00:14:13,984
WE USED TO DO MORE FENCING
AT THE LODGE

332
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:16,320
BEFORE THE POLICE CRACKDOWN.

333
00:14:16,387 --> 00:14:17,988
YOU GET THE MASK ON.

334
00:14:18,055 --> 00:14:19,924
THAT'S ME BEHIND THERE.

335
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,127
WHEN YOU HIT A GUY,
YOU WON'T HURT HIM.

336
00:14:23,193 --> 00:14:25,663
I PUT MY HAT ON
SO I'D KNOW WHO I WAS

337
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:27,064
IN CASE I GOT LOST.

338
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:30,034
BILL'S GOT A LITTLE BEEPER
ON HIS, TOO.

339
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,103
HE ACTUALLY GOT
THE PRESCRIPTION SCREEN.

340
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:35,539
DIDN'T WANT TO STRAIN HIS EYES.

341
00:14:35,606 --> 00:14:37,074
(Creaking)

342
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:39,710
COME OUT OF YOUR CORNER,
AND DOSIE-DO.

343
00:14:39,777 --> 00:14:41,211
FOR GOSH SAKES!

344
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:43,047
THAT IS A BIT FRIGHTENING.

345
00:14:43,113 --> 00:14:46,583
NOW WE GET INTO
THE MAJESTY OF IT ALL.

346
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:50,154
ALL RIGHT, SEE, NORMALLY
YOU HOLD ON TO THE SWORD.

347
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,589
IT'S A GOOD ONE ON BILL.

348
00:14:52,656 --> 00:14:55,092
OH, IT'S A GOOD ONE
ON ME, I GUESS.

349
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:57,928
OH, WELL,
I GOT THREE OTHER WHEELS.

350
00:14:57,995 --> 00:15:00,431
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT IT,
BILL.

351
00:15:00,497 --> 00:15:01,932
AND...

352
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:04,601
BACK TO THE SWORD FIGHTING.

353
00:15:04,668 --> 00:15:08,605
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
THRUST, PARRY, THRUST, THRUST,

354
00:15:08,672 --> 00:15:12,109
THRUST, THRUST, THRUST, THRUST,
THRUST, THRUST, OUCH.

355
00:15:12,176 --> 00:15:15,112
WHY DON'T YOU RUN
AND CATCH THAT, BILL?

356
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:17,114
LOOK OUT, LOOK OUT.

357
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:18,615
(Laughing)

358
00:15:18,682 --> 00:15:21,652
THE VAN KIND OF
GOT BACK AT HIM.

359
00:15:21,718 --> 00:15:23,353
TAKE THE MASK OFF.

360
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,855
IT'S OVER THERE.

361
00:15:24,922 --> 00:15:26,356
GET THAT SWORD.

362
00:15:26,423 --> 00:15:29,293
CHASING A SWORD,
THAT'S BRIGHT, ISN'T IT?

363
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:30,794
GRAB IT.

364
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:32,563
YOU MISSED IT.

365
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:34,064
OH, YOU'RE FINE.

366
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:35,966
OH, YOU'RE FINE.

367
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:38,168
IT'S JUST THROUGH YOUR SHOE.

368
00:15:38,235 --> 00:15:40,137
THERE'S NO PROBLEM THERE.

369
00:15:40,204 --> 00:15:43,473
AT LEAST NOW I KNOW
WHERE BILL IS.

370
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,577
MIGHT AS WELL FINISH THE FIGHT
THOUGH.

371
00:15:46,643 --> 00:15:49,079
(Laughing)

372
00:15:49,146 --> 00:15:50,547
I LOVE THE MIDDLE AGES.

373
00:15:50,614 --> 00:15:54,651
(Red): STAY TUNED FOR
"JASON OF THE ROUND TABLE".

374
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:04,661
(Applause and cheering)

375
00:16:04,728 --> 00:16:07,464
(Red): OK, BLOW ME A HERALD,
HAROLD!

376
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:08,966
PARDON ME?

377
00:16:09,032 --> 00:16:10,834
BLOW ME A HERALD, HAROLD!

378
00:16:10,901 --> 00:16:14,137
WHAT'S A HAROLD HAROLD,
UNCLE RED UNCLE RED?

379
00:16:14,204 --> 00:16:17,708
YOU KNOW, THE WAY THEY WOULD
HERALD THE TRUMPETS

380
00:16:17,774 --> 00:16:19,309
TO BRING THE KING IN.

381
00:16:19,376 --> 00:16:22,145
OH, YEAH, YEAH, OK, OK.

382
00:16:22,212 --> 00:16:26,149
(Fanfare)

383
00:16:26,216 --> 00:16:28,151
HERE HE COMES!

384
00:16:28,218 --> 00:16:30,187
(Applause)

385
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:38,495
(Laughing and applause)

386
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:41,498
THE OLD KING RED,
THE CONQUEROR.

387
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:42,999
HA HA!

388
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:44,568
WOW!

389
00:16:46,803 --> 00:16:50,207
YOU LOOK PSYCHOTIC, UNCLE RED.

390
00:16:50,273 --> 00:16:52,509
YOU SAUCY-TONGUED MINSTREL.

391
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:54,778
I COULD HAVE YOU BEHEADED.

392
00:16:54,845 --> 00:16:57,981
THAT'S BETTER THAN DYING OF
EMBARRASSMENT -- LOOK AT ME!

393
00:16:58,048 --> 00:17:00,283
THAT'S YOUR OWN FAULT, HAROLD.

394
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,987
I TOLD YOU YOU COULD BE
THE WIZARD IF YOU WANTED.

395
00:17:04,054 --> 00:17:05,455
WIZARD?

396
00:17:05,522 --> 00:17:06,957
I THOUGHT YOU SAID WHIZZER.

397
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:11,528
WHAT'S ALL THAT TALK ABOUT
THE ROYAL WEE ON THE THRONE?

398
00:17:15,031 --> 00:17:18,602
YOU'VE COME HOME
IN THE BEST MOOD OF YOUR LIFE.

399
00:17:18,668 --> 00:17:20,203
YOU WALK IN AND HEAR

400
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,473
THOSE WORDS THAT MAKE
YOUR BLOOD RUN COLD.

401
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,475
"WE NEED TO TALK."

402
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:28,979
MEN SHOOT THE BREEZE,
MEN CHEW THE FAT.

403
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:30,480
MEN DON'T TALK.

404
00:17:30,547 --> 00:17:34,317
SHE WANTS YOU TO DO
SOMETHING ELSE MEN DON'T DO,

405
00:17:34,384 --> 00:17:35,952
SHARE YOUR FEELINGS.

406
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:39,289
MEN ONLY HAVE THREE EMOTIONS.

407
00:17:39,356 --> 00:17:42,492
MILD ANXIETY,
FULL-BLOWN PANIC...

408
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,494
I MAY HAVE MISCOUNTED.

409
00:17:44,561 --> 00:17:47,998
NO, THERE'S THE ONE
WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING.

410
00:17:48,064 --> 00:17:49,499
PRIMAL RAGE.

411
00:17:49,566 --> 00:17:53,236
WHEREAS WOMEN HAVE
A HUGE RANGE OF EMOTIONS

412
00:17:53,303 --> 00:17:57,507
WITH THE SUBTLE GRADATIONS
OF AN F.M. RADIO DIAL.

413
00:17:57,574 --> 00:17:59,676
IF EMOTIONS WERE COLOURS,

414
00:17:59,743 --> 00:18:02,579
A WOMAN'S EMOTIONS
WOULD LOOK LIKE

415
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:06,549
THAT WALL OF PAINT CHIPS
AT THE HARDWARE STORE,

416
00:18:06,616 --> 00:18:09,452
WITH NAMES LIKE
MISTY RIVER GREEN.

417
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,721
WHEREAS MEN ARE STUCK WITH

418
00:18:11,788 --> 00:18:14,457
RUSTOLEUM RED
AND SAFETY YELLOW.

419
00:18:14,524 --> 00:18:15,959
HERE'S WHAT YOU DO.

420
00:18:16,026 --> 00:18:17,961
DON'T TALK, JUST LISTEN.

421
00:18:18,028 --> 00:18:22,198
CLAMP DOWN ON THE INSIDE
OF YOUR MOUTH WITH YOUR TEETH.

422
00:18:22,265 --> 00:18:24,334
THAT GIVES YOU A SOULFUL LOOK.

423
00:18:24,401 --> 00:18:26,536
IT MAY BRING TEARS TO YOUR EYES

424
00:18:26,603 --> 00:18:29,639
WHICH YOU CAN DAB AWAY
WITH YOUR MANLY FIST.

425
00:18:29,706 --> 00:18:31,141
SCORE BIG POINTS.

426
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:33,276
SHE'LL THINK YOU'RE SWIMMING IN

427
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,412
A DEEP WELL
OF EMOTIONAL RICHES.

428
00:18:35,478 --> 00:18:37,047
WHEREAS YOU'RE WADING IN

429
00:18:37,113 --> 00:18:39,682
THE SHALLOW END
OF CLUELESS WONDERMENT.

430
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:42,318
SO REMEMBER, BIDE YOUR TIME.

431
00:18:42,385 --> 00:18:44,387
AND BITE YOUR TONGUE.

432
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:49,492
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT PORTION
OF THE SHOW.

433
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:52,095
THIS WEEK WE HAVE
EXCELLENT EXPERTS:

434
00:18:52,162 --> 00:18:54,998
MY UNCLE RED AND HIS FRIEND,
MR. EDGAR MONTROSE.

435
00:18:55,064 --> 00:18:58,334
(Applause)

436
00:18:58,401 --> 00:18:59,936
OK,

437
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:02,205
THIS LETTER GOES AS FOLLOWS.

438
00:19:02,272 --> 00:19:05,508
IT'S FROM A VIEWER
IN MADISON, WISCONSIN.

439
00:19:05,575 --> 00:19:07,010
OH, HO, HO.

440
00:19:07,076 --> 00:19:10,180
"DEAR EXPERTS, I AM RESTORING
A 1963 RAMBLER.

441
00:19:10,246 --> 00:19:11,681
"AT 2 A.M. LAST NIGHT

442
00:19:11,748 --> 00:19:14,217
"I WENT INTO THE HOUSE
FOR A BANDAGE

443
00:19:14,284 --> 00:19:16,452
"AND I FOUND A NOTE
FROM MY WIFE

444
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:18,688
"SAYING THAT
SHE WAS LEAVING ME.

445
00:19:18,755 --> 00:19:20,356
"HER CLOTHES WERE GONE,

446
00:19:20,423 --> 00:19:23,493
"AND I THINK SHE TOOK
MOST OF THE FURNITURE.

447
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,029
"IS SHE KIDDING

448
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:28,531
"OR WHAT?

449
00:19:28,598 --> 00:19:31,367
"SIGNED, CONFUSED."

450
00:19:31,434 --> 00:19:34,437
WELL, THANKS FOR WRITING,
CONFUSED,

451
00:19:34,504 --> 00:19:37,373
RATHER THAN SHOWING UP
IN PERSON.

452
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,778
OK, NOW, THE HARDEST THING
ABOUT THESE SITUATIONS

453
00:19:41,844 --> 00:19:44,414
IS GETTING RID OF THE STOVE.

454
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:49,886
MR. MONTROSE,

455
00:19:49,953 --> 00:19:53,623
THIS GENTLEMAN HERE,
HE'S GOT A RAMBLER.

456
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,124
HIS WIFE IS GONE.

457
00:19:55,191 --> 00:19:58,828
ONCE A MAN STARTS COOKING,
THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

458
00:19:58,895 --> 00:20:01,431
HE THINKS HE CAN
LIVE WITHOUT WOMEN.

459
00:20:01,497 --> 00:20:06,102
AND THAT WAY LIES MADNESS.

460
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:10,206
AND BELIEVE ME, I'M NOT JUST
GUESSING ABOUT THIS.

461
00:20:10,273 --> 00:20:12,842
YOU GOTTA GET RID
OF THE STOVE.

462
00:20:16,412 --> 00:20:18,047
NOT THAT EASY TO DO, EDGAR.

463
00:20:18,114 --> 00:20:20,616
THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS
WON'T LET YOU

464
00:20:20,683 --> 00:20:23,353
JUST THROW 'EM INTO THE LAKE
ANYMORE.

465
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:26,222
I'D PUT HER UP
ON TOP OF THE VAN,

466
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:30,193
GO FOR A DRIVE --
WHATEVER HAPPENS HAPPENS.

467
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:32,929
PARTS PER MILLION,
THAT'S THE SECRET.

468
00:20:35,431 --> 00:20:37,567
LOWER THE PARTS PER MILLION.

469
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:39,368
REDUCE THE DENSITY.

470
00:20:39,435 --> 00:20:43,539
BREAK THAT BABY DOWN
INTO TINY LITTLE PIECES

471
00:20:43,606 --> 00:20:47,276
SO IT CAN BE
ABSORBED BY THE EARTH.

472
00:20:47,343 --> 00:20:50,379
PUT A TRIPLE CHARGE
OF NUMBER SEVEN DYNAMITE

473
00:20:50,446 --> 00:20:53,549
IN THE OVEN DRAWER AND KABOOM!

474
00:20:53,616 --> 00:20:56,252
(Applause)

475
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:03,059
YOU KNOW, THAT WOULD BE
KIND OF FUN TO WATCH.

476
00:21:03,126 --> 00:21:04,494
SOUNDS INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS.

477
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,362
EXACTLY.

478
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:08,764
DON'T HAVE A MAGNET
IN YOUR POCKET

479
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:10,366
OR YOU'LL WIND UP WITH

480
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:13,436
200 POUNDS OF IRON FILINGS
IN YOUR SHORTS...

481
00:21:15,571 --> 00:21:17,006
... AGAIN.

482
00:21:17,073 --> 00:21:19,709
(Laughing)

483
00:21:19,775 --> 00:21:23,279
BLOW UP A STOVE AND ROMANCE
COMES BACK INTO YOUR LIFE.

484
00:21:23,346 --> 00:21:26,682
QUITE POSSIBLY THE STUPIDEST
ADVICE I'VE EVER HEARD.

485
00:21:26,749 --> 00:21:28,985
WELL, OF COURSE IT IS, HAROLD.

486
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:31,020
WE'RE JUST KILLING TIME HERE.

487
00:21:31,087 --> 00:21:32,521
THAT'S FOR SURE.

488
00:21:32,588 --> 00:21:34,857
ANYONE WHO'S RESTORING
A RAMBLER

489
00:21:34,924 --> 00:21:36,525
IS BEYOND HELP ANYWAY.

490
00:21:36,592 --> 00:21:38,961
(Laughing)

491
00:21:46,102 --> 00:21:49,639
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
TWO GUYS IN HOME-MADE ARMOUR

492
00:21:49,705 --> 00:21:52,842
CARRYING WOODEN LANCES,
HEADING AT EACH OTHER

493
00:21:52,908 --> 00:21:56,045
ON A COUPLE OF POMMEL HORSES
BOLTED TO K-CARS

494
00:21:56,112 --> 00:21:58,047
WOULD BE DANGEROUS?

495
00:21:58,114 --> 00:22:01,851
I GUESS IT WAS ROUGH BEING
A KNIGHT OF THE ROUND TABLE.

496
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:03,352
COURSE, IN THOSE DAYS

497
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:06,822
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT A TIE-ROD BREAKING.

498
00:22:06,889 --> 00:22:09,191
THERE WAS CARS
SWERVING EVERYWHERE.

499
00:22:09,258 --> 00:22:11,460
WHEN STINKY PETERSON'S
MONK ROBES

500
00:22:11,527 --> 00:22:13,162
GOT STUCK IN THAT BUMPER,

501
00:22:13,229 --> 00:22:16,265
HE WENT FROM BEING FRIAR TUCK
TO LADY GODIVA.

502
00:22:16,332 --> 00:22:20,269
IT MADE US APPRECIATE
THE THINGS WE HAVE TODAY.

503
00:22:20,336 --> 00:22:22,171
AMBULANCES, STRETCHERS,
X-RAY MACHINES.

504
00:22:22,238 --> 00:22:24,974
MEETING TIME.
(Squealing)

505
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,509
YOU GO AHEAD.

506
00:22:26,575 --> 00:22:28,144
I WANT TO GET THIS OFF.

507
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,012
I'M GETTING METAL FATIGUE.

508
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,249
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,
I'M NO LONGER KING RED.

509
00:22:33,315 --> 00:22:35,017
I'VE RENOUNCED MY THRONE.

510
00:22:35,084 --> 00:22:38,287
I'M GOING BACK TO BEING A SERF
AND "SERF'S UP".

511
00:22:38,354 --> 00:22:41,490
TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

512
00:22:41,557 --> 00:22:46,529
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND HAROLD
AND THE GANG AT POSSUM LODGE,

513
00:22:46,595 --> 00:22:49,532
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

514
00:22:49,598 --> 00:22:54,537
(Applause and cheering)

515
00:22:54,603 --> 00:22:57,540
(Possum squeal)

516
00:22:57,606 --> 00:22:59,041
HERE'S HERE.

517
00:22:59,108 --> 00:23:01,544
UP AND AT 'EM.

518
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:07,550
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

519
00:23:09,552 --> 00:23:12,154
(Red): WELL, HERE WE ARE.
