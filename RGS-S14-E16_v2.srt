157
00:08:15,927 --> 00:08:17,796
AND MY OWN CHAIN SAW.

158
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:20,165
AND WHAT DID I DO
WITH THIS GOOD FORTUNE?

159
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:24,402
HOW ABOUT A DINING ROOM TABLE
FOR PEOPLE ON THE GO?

160
00:08:24,402 --> 00:08:26,504
OR A TRAY FOR SERVING
DRINKS TO PEOPLE

161
00:08:26,504 --> 00:08:29,040
WHO ARE GETTING
A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY.

162
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,376
OR WHAT IF YOU
LIKE TO SIT OUTSIDE?

163
00:08:31,376 --> 00:08:32,911
OR MAYBE THE PEOPLE
IN YOUR FAMILY

164
00:08:32,911 --> 00:08:34,579
FORCE YOU TO SIT OUTSIDE.

165
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:38,016
WELL, HOW ABOUT A
HIGHWAY SIGN MUSKOKA CHAIR?

166
00:08:38,016 --> 00:08:39,718
BUT WHAT IF
YOU'RE NOT HANDY?

167
00:08:39,718 --> 00:08:41,586
WHAT DO YOU DO THEN?

AND A WHOLE BUNCH
MORE INSIDE.

I WANNA TALK TO THE WOMEN OUT
THERE ABOUT SOMETHING
IMPORTANT.

179
00:09:25,797 --> 00:09:29,634
YOU MAY NOT KNOW THIS,
BUT AS US GUYS GET ON IN YEARS,

180
00:09:29,634 --> 00:09:32,604
OUR NEEDS IN
THE BEDROOM CHANGE.

181
00:09:32,604 --> 00:09:36,875
IT'S ALL PART OF THE
TIME-SPACE CONTINUUM.

182

WE A LITTLE MORE TIME,
BUT WE NEED A LOT MORE SPACE.

183
00:09:40,612 --> 00:09:42,781
SEE, WHEN BERNICE
AND I FIRST MARRIED

184
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:45,850
WE SLEPT ON A 3/4 BED WITH
OUR ARMS AND LEGS ALL
TANGLED UP,

185
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,754
LIKE FOUR POUNDS OF WORMS
IN A THREE-POUND CAN.

186
00:09:49,754 --> 00:09:51,990
AFTER BEING MARRIED
FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS,

187
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,359
WE BOTH NEEDED A DOUBLE.

188
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:55,293
AND THEN A QUEEN SIZED,

189
00:09:55,293 --> 00:09:57,228
AND NOW WE'RE
UP TO A KING.

190
00:09:57,228 --> 00:10:00,798
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S NEXT,
AN ACE OR MAYBE A JOKER.

191
00:10:00,798 --> 00:10:04,569
THE LONGER YOU'RE TOGETHER
THE BIGGER THE BED.

192

I THINK IF YOU'RE
MARRIED LONG ENOUGH

193
00:10:06,371 --> 00:10:08,473
YOU START SLEEPING
ON THE POOL COVER.

194
00:10:08,473 --> 00:10:10,909
NOW, THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH ROMANCE OR LOVE

195
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:13,478
OR ANYTHING THEY
TALK ABOUT ON OPRAH.

196
00:10:13,478 --> 00:10:15,680
THIS IS ALL ABOUT TWO BODIES

197

WHO START HAVING
A MIND OF THEIR OWN,

AND PUNCHING

IT'S SAFER FOR EVERYONE

WOULD BE GRATEFUL.

WOULD BE A LOT OF THINGS.

THE POINT OF THE CAR

WAS TO HELP GET BONNIE
BACK INTO MY LIFE.

GET THE THING INTO A CAN --

WITH THE CANS.

HAD THE THING.
