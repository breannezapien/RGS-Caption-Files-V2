1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,905
You ever notice how
technology sucks us in

2
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:07,607
and then ridicules us?

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,008
Like back in the '50s,

4
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:11,878
if you were the first one
to have a TV antenna
on your roof,

5
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:13,780
you got a lot of respect.

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,149
These days, if you're the
last house to have one,

7
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,384
you get a lot
of bird droppings.

8
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,320
You know it's ugly

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,955
and you know you're
not using it anymore

10
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,223
'cause now you're on cable

11
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:26,159
or even better, you're on
your neighbour's cable,

12
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,528
but how do you get
the antenna off there?

13
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,263
You're getting a little
long in the tooth

14
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:32,065
to be climbing up on the roof
what with the bad knees

15
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:34,234
and the higher
center of gravity.

16
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:36,803
But you still
got imagination.

17
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,404
So go down to the wreckers

18
00:00:38,404 --> 00:00:39,772
and get yourself
a steering wheel.

19
00:00:39,772 --> 00:00:41,441
Not just any
steering wheel...

20
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:44,210
the kind that has the
personal airbag in the middle.

21
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,246
You know the ones where
if you hit a pothole

22
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:50,083
the bag explodes and breaks
your nose so you don't get hurt.

23
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:54,687
Now just slide the steering
wheel into a garbage can,

24
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:59,659
and then aim the whole unit
at the TV aerial.

25
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:05,365
Now you need a projectile
of some kind.

26
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:09,269
Here's a hint, don't think
of it as an antenna,

27
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:13,473
think of it as a headpin.

28

Big, big week up at
the lodge this week.

34
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:45,571

478 pounds of vein-
clogging cholesterol.

and two hooves.

Yeah.

I was downstairs, right?
I was downstairs.

There's like a cow
in the freezer.

50
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:20,706
It winked at me.

51
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:23,109
Harold, it
didn't wink.

52
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,877
It's only got
one eye, okay.

I told you,

don't half
a cow, man.

00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:35,121
I said that.
I said it.

58
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:38,724
You know how
tongs work, Harold?

59
00:02:38,724 --> 00:02:40,726
Yeah, okay,
all right.

60
00:02:40,726 --> 00:02:43,696
I don't know why you need
that much red meat anyway.

61
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,865
You know, being a vegetarian
is much healthier.

62
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:48,167
Oh yeah, well that cow
was a vegetarian.

63
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,870
How's her health?

64
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,638
You like math,

00:02:52,638 --> 00:02:54,140
try these
numbers, okay?

66
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,243
I got that side of pure
beef for 38 bucks, okay?

67
00:02:57,243 --> 00:03:00,112
It'll feed 300 lodge members
at 10 bucks a head.

68
00:03:00,112 --> 00:03:03,983
Okay, that's a $3000 return
on a $38 investment.

69

I got 2962,

Okay, all right.

Why, what's
the problem?

73
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:16,262
Well, I just wondered who
would sell you an entire
side of beef for $38?

00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,664
Flinty McClintock.
What!

00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:20,166
No, nope, don't make
a big deal out of this.

76
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,634
I might want
to buy more.

77
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:24,036
Have you ever considered
that perhaps that
the meat is BAD?

78
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:25,972
You know, like it's all
gristly or something?

79
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:29,976
It's 478 pounds of beef
and it cost $38, Harold.

80
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,211
Stop looking for trouble.

81
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,613

one of the few successful
entrepreneurs in
the entire area

83
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:39,618
just didn't know
the value of the meat.

84
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:40,853
Well, I don't even care.

When I'm happy I don't look
for ways to kill the mood.

got this great bargain
from Flinty

you should just let

needs to do.

00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:52,732
Yeah, exactly.

I have someone to bring
me drinks and snacks

and whatever I want
whenever I want it.

00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:03,061
Then you find out she's
thinking the same thing,

137
00:06:03,061 --> 00:06:05,230
which is why
you have kids.

138

But then they move out,

139
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,500
and after you
finally admit

140
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,602
that dogs and cats are not
all that trainable,

Give up your dreams
or build a robot.

For my robot I'm going to use
this wireless video camera

00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:21,413
that sends a

so that I can direct the unit
to wherever I want it to go

from the comfort of
my own living room.

00:07:20,972 --> 00:07:22,908
I had to make a bit
of a compromise here.

157
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:26,011
See, I'm using this radio
antenna for his
extendable arm

158
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:28,447
but I needed a way for
it to move up and down

159
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:30,115
and side to side.

160
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:31,850
I thought there might be
a way to mount the unit

161
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,319
onto a windshield wiper
motor for the up and down

162
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,221
and then to mount
that WHOLE thing

163
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:39,057
onto another wiper motor
for the side to side.

164
00:07:39,057 --> 00:07:41,126
I'm sure there's
a way to do that,

165
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:43,829
but I was starting to get
a really bad headache.

166
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:45,831
So instead I
mounted the antenna

167
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:48,300
on just one wiper motor
but at kind of an angle

168
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,569
so it goes up and down
and side to side

169
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:52,404
at the same time.

170
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:55,140
It does two things at once
but not very well.

171
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,776
Kind of like when
Madonna took up acting.

172
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:00,745
I'm running everything
off a car battery

173
00:08:00,745 --> 00:08:03,482
and I control the wiper motor
and the antenna and the camera

174
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:06,618
with this
custom controller.

175
00:08:06,618 --> 00:08:08,553
They're actually just
garage door openers

176
00:08:08,553 --> 00:08:10,255
but you'd never know.

177
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:13,124
Just need a couple more things
to make him completely human

178
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:15,961
like a fondue fork
for the end of his Canadarm

179
00:08:15,961 --> 00:08:18,163
so he can stab things

180
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:21,499
and a crowbar to guarantee
unrestricted access.

181
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:26,004
The only job left
is to figure out a
way to make him mobile.

182
00:08:39,618 --> 00:08:41,186
Problem solved.

183
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:43,555
I got a couple of heavy-duty
radio-controlled toys

184
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:45,557
and mounted them
as the robot's wheels.

185
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:50,195
The clothes make him
look almost human...

186
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:52,130
like Moose Thompson.

187
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,798
He can go forwards,
backwards

188
00:08:53,798 --> 00:08:56,201
and I can steer it
which is always helpful.

189
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:59,638
Heck, if I put one vehicle in
drive and the other in reverse,

190
00:08:59,638 --> 00:09:02,641
I could make him spin
right on the spot.

191
00:09:04,976 --> 00:09:06,611
And thanks to my
video camera,

192
00:09:06,611 --> 00:09:10,281
I can see everything he's
doing right here on my TV

193
00:09:13,418 --> 00:09:16,254
And that's how you make
your very own robot valet.

194
00:09:16,254 --> 00:09:18,390
So remember, if the women
don't find you handsome,

195
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,658
they should at least
find you handy.

196
00:09:20,658 --> 00:09:22,494
And now for
a demonstration,

197
00:09:22,494 --> 00:09:25,864
my cyborg will bring me
a nice, light repast.

198
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:30,668
This is like one
of those doctors

199
00:09:30,668 --> 00:09:32,971
doing a fancy
surgical procedure.

200

Thank you, dear.

I want to talk
to you guys out there

205
00:10:26,424 --> 00:10:28,493
who leave everything

You know who you are.

By the time you got around
to buying your wife
a birthday present

208
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:37,869
the only shops open were
the 7-11 and the liquor store.

211

I think I know why men leave
things to the last minute...

00:10:47,812 --> 00:10:49,948
sports and movies.

213

In any professional game,

No sports fan has any idea
of what two minutes left

00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:03,995
means in real life.

218
00:11:03,995 --> 00:11:07,532
And to a man, movies are
kind of like being intimate.

Maybe that just means
it's lean meat.

yeah, fire extinguisher

These are the CO2.

303

What they do is they put
carbon dioxide out

304
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:02,966
and that smothers the fire
by taking all the oxygen
out of the air.

305
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:04,401
So Bill's just going
to do that to --

No, Bill, there's a pin.
There's a pin on the unit.

You pull the pin --
Yeah.

308

So now Bill took a lungful
of carbon dioxide.

309
00:15:12,443 --> 00:15:15,245
He needs some air
I figure just little --

Give him a little bit of air
