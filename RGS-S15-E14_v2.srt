can tell us about this one

162
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:54,713
I see your trap is open.

163
00:06:54,713 --> 00:06:57,883
You should talk.

164
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:02,421
Okay, uh...
this is a leg trap.

165
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:06,591
It's a Colin & Bronton
1937 Paw Master 75.

166
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:08,293
Wow, it looks dangerous.

167
00:07:08,293 --> 00:07:09,194
Should you be
handling it like that

168
00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:10,829
if it is dangerous?

169
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:12,664
Oh, well yeah,
very much so, oh yeah.

170
00:07:12,664 --> 00:07:16,768
But this one
is rusted open.

171
00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:21,873
Yeah, urine will do that.

172
00:07:21,873 --> 00:07:24,276
How do you know
urine did it?

173
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:28,580
I'd rather not say.

174
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,084
Now here's a very
important trap.

175
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,453
We use this for catching
the cleverest animal

176
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:39,524
known to man,
the raccoon.

177
00:07:41,893 --> 00:07:43,862
That's a cat.

178
00:07:43,862 --> 00:07:48,033
It looks like a cat.

179
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:53,305
Like I say, raccoons
are clever.

180
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:55,540
Now, for a commercial
fisherman,

181
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,742
there are
lobster traps

182
00:07:57,742 --> 00:08:02,013
and this one, this is
one used right here

183
00:08:02,013 --> 00:08:03,849
on Possum Lake.

184
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:06,751
I thought that lobsters
were saltwater crustaceans.

185
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:08,653
Yeah but around here,
a fisherman can make

186
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:14,893
a pretty good living
pulling up snowmobile gloves.

187
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:16,428
Okay.

188
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:18,497
Now, say you want
to catch a mouse.

189
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:19,764
Oh, that'd great because
then we could feed it

190
00:08:19,764 --> 00:08:22,567
to this raccoon.

191
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:27,205
Okay.

192
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:28,640
This is the best.

193
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,842
This is the Rat Master 500

194
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:35,146
and its got a couple... AUUGH!

195
00:08:35,146 --> 00:08:38,350
OWWW! NOT AGAIN!

196
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,853
NOT AGAIN!

197
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:47,826
You know, a lot of people
don't care for accordion music.

198
00:08:47,826 --> 00:08:49,227
They make jokes about it

199
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:51,563
like, the difference
between an accordion
and a trampoline

200
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:55,100
is you take your shoes off
and jump on a trampoline.

201
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,901
Or the definition
of an optimist

202
00:08:56,901 --> 00:08:59,738
is an accordion
player with a pager.

203
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:02,007
Or, if you play one
more note on that thing

204
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:03,274
you're going to need
a surgeon to remove it

205
00:09:03,274 --> 00:09:05,610
from your large intestine.

206
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,646
Now, I don't know
anything about music

207
00:09:07,646 --> 00:09:09,347
but I do have an opinion.

208
00:09:09,347 --> 00:09:11,016
It seems that if
something isn't good,

209
00:09:11,016 --> 00:09:13,651
alls they do is
make it real loud.

210
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:15,320
Like rap music or opera

211
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,223
or the laugh track
on Who's The Boss.

212
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:21,326
So I'm going to make
my accordion really loud

213
00:09:21,326 --> 00:09:23,228
with a few simple components:

214
00:09:23,228 --> 00:09:25,163
a vinyl folding door,

215
00:09:25,163 --> 00:09:27,298
some parts from
this old toilet

216
00:09:27,298 --> 00:09:28,666
and a late model minivan

217
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,902
with a power sliding
door and a sunroof.

218
00:09:30,902 --> 00:09:37,108
Oh yeah, and of
course, a stool.

219
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:39,444
I really lucked out
on this minivan.

220
00:09:39,444 --> 00:09:41,546
The salesman said
try it for the weekend

221
00:09:41,546 --> 00:09:43,081
so I am.

222
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:45,650
Alls I'm doing is I'm taking
the accordion air pump

223
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,852
and putting it on steroids.

224
00:09:47,852 --> 00:09:51,055
I've magnified the bellows
by mounting the folding door

225
00:09:51,055 --> 00:09:52,757
inside the slider opening.

226
00:09:52,757 --> 00:09:54,058
And this is a power unit

227
00:09:54,058 --> 00:09:55,393
so I don't have to
do any work

228
00:09:55,393 --> 00:09:58,363
which is music to my ears.

229
00:09:58,363 --> 00:10:01,566
Now if you've seen the
inside of an accordion,

230
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:03,701
I hope you've apologized
to the owner

231
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:06,271
and you also know that
there's a valve on the back

232
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:09,807
that lets the air in when
the bellows are opened up.

233
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:12,110
So I got this toilet
flapper valve

234
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,811
mounted over the
hole in the floor

235
00:10:13,811 --> 00:10:17,382
and connected by this chain
to the toilet handle.

236
00:10:17,382 --> 00:10:19,183
So now, every time
the door slides open,

237
00:10:19,183 --> 00:10:21,119
it automatically
flushes the toilet

238
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:25,523
and lets the new air in.

239
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:34,032
Okay, I've made the van
completely air tight

240
00:10:34,032 --> 00:10:36,334
using the handyman's
secret weapon

241
00:10:36,334 --> 00:10:38,336
and I mounted the business
side of the accordion

242
00:10:38,336 --> 00:10:39,537
over the sunroof

243
00:10:39,537 --> 00:10:41,906
so that all the air
will pass through it.

244
00:10:41,906 --> 00:10:43,408
Now, I had to rewire
the remote a little bit

245
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:46,778
so that the side door
would open and close
without stopping.

246
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:48,379
It's a lot easier
than I thought.

247
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:54,052
I just put it in the
microwave for a few minutes.

248
00:10:54,052 --> 00:11:00,925
And now, if you'll excuse me,

249
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:04,329
it's showtime!

The other day I was thinking
back to when I was a teenager

254
00:11:43,034 --> 00:11:46,304
as a way of getting ready
for my second childhood.

255

We had an expression
back then...

Whenever you went on a date,

257

to know if you got lucky.

I mean that was big.

00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:01,686
Any guy that could get lucky
must be really something.

261
00:12:01,686 --> 00:12:03,221
We had one guy, Brett,

262
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:04,689
he never played baseball

263
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:07,692

most of them inside the park.

00:12:10,895 --> 00:12:13,397
Well, I ran into Brett
a couple of weeks ago

266
00:12:13,397 --> 00:12:16,467
and I would say that his
luck has kind of run out.

00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:01,891
C'mon hurry up and sit down.

480
00:21:01,891 --> 00:21:04,260
Sit down there.

481
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:09,131
All rise.

482
00:21:09,131 --> 00:21:12,201
Quando omni flunkus moritati.

483
00:21:12,201 --> 00:21:14,804
Sit down.

484
00:21:14,804 --> 00:21:17,306
Bow your heads
for the man's prayer.

485
00:21:17,306 --> 00:21:18,774
I'm a man

486
00:21:18,774 --> 00:21:20,276
but I can change

487
00:21:20,276 --> 00:21:21,911
if I have to

488
00:21:21,911 --> 00:21:24,614
I guess.

489
00:21:24,614 --> 00:21:25,982
All right men, apparently

490
00:21:25,982 --> 00:21:28,751
the beachfront doesn't
belong to anybody

491
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:31,087
which limits the liability
of all the land owners

492
00:21:31,087 --> 00:21:32,788
including the lodge.

493
00:21:32,788 --> 00:21:34,624
So from now on whenever
you see something

494
00:21:34,624 --> 00:21:36,292
that looks like it's
going to blow up,

495
00:21:36,292 --> 00:21:37,693
take her down to the dock.
