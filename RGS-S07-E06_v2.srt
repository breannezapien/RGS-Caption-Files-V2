APPRECIATE IT.

9
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,072
I WAS ALMOST LATE FOR
THE SHOW, THERE, TODAY.

10
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,541
BUNCH OF KIDS, THERE, BLOCKING
THE WAY UP AT THE TOP
OF CARDIAC HILL.

11
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:43,743
WELL, THEY WERE ON
THE SIDEWALK, WEREN'T THEY?

12
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,112
YEAH, BUT I WAS TAKING MY
SHORTCUT, YOU KNOW?

13
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,348
YEAH, I FIGURE,
WHEN I'M DRIVING,

14
00:00:48,414 --> 00:00:52,252
EVERYTHING BETWEEN THE FIRE
HYDRANTS IS MY TERRITORY,
YOU KNOW?

15
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,053
WHAT THE HECK WERE THOSE KIDS
DOING UP THERE, HAROLD?

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,488
WELL, THOSE ARE
THE LITTLE GUYS.

17
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,357
YOU KNOW? FROM THE BIG GUY
LITTLE GUY CLUB.

18
00:00:57,423 --> 00:00:59,192
IT'S, LIKE, WHERE A MAN
VOLUNTEERS HIS TIME TO BE

19
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,794
WITH A LITTLE BOY WHO DOESN'T
HAVE A FATHER AVAILABLE.

20
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:04,764
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.
I'M THEIR SECRETARY.

21
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,866
I'VE ASKED YOU TO
JOIN A MILLION TIMES.

22
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,235
OH, NO, I CAN'T RELATE, HAROLD.

23
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:12,138
I FIND THE YOUNG PEOPLE WANT TO
DO THINGS FAST AND OFTEN.

24
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:14,974
THAT'S NOT
REALLY MY STYLE.

25
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:18,311
WELL, REALLY, WHEN YOU THINK
OF IT, THAT'S PART OF THE
CHALLENGE, ACTUALLY.

26
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:21,948
YOU KNOW, DEFINING COMMON
INTERESTS AND ACTIVITIES
TO SHARE WITH THE YOUNG BOY.

27
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,984
WELL, THAT'S WHY
WE'RE HAVING THE
SOAP BOX DERBY.

28
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:26,386
SOAP BOX DERBY?

OH, NOW, I LOVE
THE SOAP BOX DERBIES.

30
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,325
IF YOU WERE TO BECOME A BIG GUY,
AND WE FOUND YOU A LITTLE GUY,

31
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:35,094
YOU COULD BE IN THE DERBY.

32
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:36,763
WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO MAKE A BIG COMMITMENT.

33
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:39,532
MAYBE I COULD BE A
24-HOUR BIG GUY.

34
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,467
OKAY. BUT I'D HAVE TO
RUN YOUR NAME THROUGH
THE COMPUTER.

35
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:44,303
HOW COME?
TO FIND OUT IF YOU'VE
EVER BEEN IN TROUBLE
WITH THE POLICE.

36
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,172

THAT'S NOT TOO BAD, HAROLD.
THERE'S NO FATALITIES THERE.

OH, JUST ONE:

WHY WOULD YOU CARE?
SHE'S NO FRIEND OF YOURS.

YOU BETTER START BEING
NICE TO ME, YOU KNOW,

WAS THAT
GOOD ENOUGH?

92
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:35,407
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST MADE THE SONG UP.

93
00:04:37,376 --> 00:04:40,379
OH, MY UNCLE JOE WAS
A HANDSOME MAN

WITH HIS ICY COLD BLUE EYES

95
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,251
BUT THE THING THAT
MADE HIM DIFFERENT

96
00:04:45,317 --> 00:04:47,453
MY UNCLE JOE WAS
COVERED WITH FLIES

97
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:52,825
OH, UNCLE JOE HAD LOTS OF
FLIES ZOOMING ROUND HIS HEAD

98
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,261
I'VE SEEN OTHER THINGS WITH
MORE FLIES ON 'EM

99
00:04:55,327 --> 00:04:57,329
BUT MOST OF THEM WERE DEAD

100
00:04:57,396 --> 00:05:00,399
OH, UNCLE JOE WAS
A WILD, WILD, MAN

101
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,968
HE'D DRINK HOMEMADE
BEER BY THE DOZEN

102
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:05,738
DOES HE ACT THAT WAY
BECAUSE OF THE FLIES

103
00:05:05,804 --> 00:05:08,874
OR IS UNCLE JOE THE
ONE WITH THE BUZZ ON?

104
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:12,578
OKEYDOKEY DOO!

ALL RIGHT, THINK ABOUT

132
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,410
YOU HAVE A WALLET IN
YOUR POCKET, OKAY?

133
00:06:18,477 --> 00:06:20,345
THAT WALLET IS
FULL OF MONEY.

134
00:06:20,412 --> 00:06:22,281
THAT WALLET IS
FULL OF CREDIT CARDS.

135

SO YOU GO RIGHT UP TO
THE COUNTER AND YOU...

136
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:27,519
MIKE, YOU GO
RIGHT UP THERE.

137
00:06:27,586 --> 00:06:30,122
WHAT YOU DO IS YOU
TAKE IT, AND YOU...

138
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,391
RETURN IT?

139
00:06:32,457 --> 00:06:39,464
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

140
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:42,568
HEY. HEY. HEY. HEY. HEY.
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

141
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:45,404
THIS IS $50 SHORT.

142
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,372
YEAH, I HAD TO
MAKE A FEW PURCHASES.

143
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,608
(FRANTIC BELL RINGING)

144
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:50,742
CONGRATULATIONS.

145
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:54,112
THAT'S MARVELOUS.
WAY TO GO!

146
00:06:54,746 --> 00:06:58,183
ALL RIGHT. SO YOUR VAN HAS BLOWN
A GASKET, AND YOU'RE ABOUT
TO DO THE SAME.

147
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,387
BUT YOU'RE LOOKIN' AT A TOW
TRUCK CHARGE THAT'S GONNA
BE MORE THAN THE DARN
VEHICLE'S WORTH.

148
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:04,623
SO I THOUGHT THIS WEEK ON
HANDYMAN CORNER,

149
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,926
I'D SHOW YOU A WAY TO AVOID
THOSE ENDLESS TOW TRUCK CHARGES.

150
00:07:07,993 --> 00:07:10,429
BASICALLY, NOW, YOU'VE
GOT TWO CHOICES.

151
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:12,698
ONE:  YOU COULD BUILD
YOUR OWN TOW TRUCK;

152
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:15,200
BUT, OTHERWISE, YOU COULD TAKE
BETTER CARE OF YOUR VEHICLE.

153
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:17,736
GET THAT MAINTENANCE DONE
ON A REGULAR BASIS.

154
00:07:17,803 --> 00:07:20,339
ALL RIGHT. HERE'S HOW
TO BUILD YOUR OWN TOW TRUCK.

155
00:07:20,405 --> 00:07:22,507
FIRST THING YOU NEED
IS A BOAT TRAILER.

156
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:24,176
IF YOU DON'T HAVE
A BOAT TRAILER,

157
00:07:24,242 --> 00:07:26,878
JUST GO DOWN TO YOUR LOCAL
MARINA AND YOU CAN PICK
ONE UP CHEAP.

158
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:29,548
OR, IF YOU'RE REALLY
ON A BUDGET,

159
00:07:29,614 --> 00:07:31,283
GO DOWN TO YOUR LOCAL BOAT RAMP
AND JUST PICK ONE UP.

160
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:33,719
ALL RIGHT. NEXT THING
YOU NEED IS A TRUCK.

161
00:07:33,785 --> 00:07:36,488
UNFORTUNATELY, MY TRUCK
IS THE VAN.

162
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:38,790
SO I BOUGHT THIS CAR
OFF BUSTER HATFIELD.

163
00:07:38,857 --> 00:07:41,426
I GAVE HIM $100 FOR IT,
AND I KNOW THAT'S A LOT
TO PAY FOR A CAR,

164
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:43,428
BUT I WANTED SOMETHING
THAT WOULD LAST.

165
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:45,297
SO NOW I'M GONNA
MAKE A TOW TRUCK.

166
00:07:45,363 --> 00:07:47,732
WELL, I SHOULD SAY A TOW CAR.

167
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:54,172
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS LIFT THE
TONGUE OF THE TRAILER UP HIGH
ENOUGH AND GET THE BACK
END UNDER THERE.

168
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:56,241
AND THEN YOU WANT TO
GET IT A LONG WAY IN.

169
00:07:56,308 --> 00:07:58,376
OTHERWISE, IT COULD
BE DANGEROUS.

170
00:07:58,443 --> 00:08:02,948
OKAY, NOW YOU WANT TO ATTACH
THAT TO THE BACK OF THE CAR
AS FIRMLY AS POSSIBLE.

171
00:08:03,014 --> 00:08:06,351
AND THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE SEEN
THE SHOW BEFORE KNOW WHAT I'M
GOING TO SAY NEXT.

172
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:09,054
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
WE'RE MARRIED.

173
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,091
ALL RIGHT. THAT'S GOT HER.

174
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:16,761
NOW WHAT YOU DO IS YOU TAKE
YOUR CABLE OFF THE WINCH THERE,

175
00:08:16,828 --> 00:08:21,066
AND YOU TAKE THAT DOWN,

176
00:08:21,132 --> 00:08:23,335
HOOK HER RIGHT ON TO VEHICLE
THAT NEEDS TO BE TOWED,

177
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:27,839
AND THEN YOU JUST WINCH THE
TRAILER DOWN SO THE HITCH FITS
RIGHT ON TO THE BALL.

178
00:08:27,906 --> 00:08:29,140
ALL RIGHT.

179
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,826
AND THAT'S GOT HER.

180
00:08:47,892 --> 00:08:49,594
ALL RIGHT. JUST CLAMP
HER DOWN HERE.

181
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:54,399
AND, GUYS, IF YOU HAVE
A TWO-INCH HITCH, USE A
TWO-INCH BALL NOT A 1 7/8TH.

182
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:58,136
YOU'VE GOT A TON OF METAL UP
IN THE AIR HELD TOGETHER TO
YOUR CAR WITH DUCT TAPE.

183
00:08:58,203 --> 00:09:00,105
LET'S NOT BE STUPID.

184
00:09:00,171 --> 00:09:01,840
SAME THING WITH
THE SAFETY CHAINS.

185
00:09:01,906 --> 00:09:03,541
NOT SOMETHING YOU
USE A WHOLE LOT,

186
00:09:03,608 --> 00:09:05,410
BUT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE
EVER GOING TO USE 'EM,

187
00:09:05,477 --> 00:09:07,145
THIS MIGHT JUST BE THE TIME.

188
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,382
NOW I JUST GOT TO ADD SOME
WEIGHT TO MY TOW TRUCK,

189
00:09:10,448 --> 00:09:11,916
AND WE'RE DONE.

190
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:21,226
BOY -- OH, THIS SHOULD DO IT.

191
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:25,130
AND THAT'S GOT HER.

192
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:29,033
SO, REMEMBER, IF WOMEN DON'T
FIND YOU HANDSOME, THEY SHOULD
AT LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

193
00:09:30,835 --> 00:09:32,470
AND NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

194
00:09:32,537 --> 00:09:35,006
I REALLY MUST BE TOWING.

195
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:52,791
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU OLDER GUYS
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WOMEN
DO BETTER THAN US --

196
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:55,160
OTHER THAN SHAVE THEIR LEGS --

197
00:09:55,226 --> 00:09:57,395
AND THAT IS TALK.

198
00:09:58,463 --> 00:09:59,831
YOU KNOW, WHEN A GUY GETS MAD,

199
00:09:59,898 --> 00:10:02,300
HIS VOCABULARY WILL SHIFT DOWN
TO THE FOUR LETTER WORDS...

200
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,836
DANG, SHUCKS, GOSH,

201
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:07,705
AND EVEN WORSE IF
THE KIDS AREN'T AROUND.

202
00:10:07,772 --> 00:10:09,541
BUT WHEN A WOMAN
GETS TICKED OFF,

203
00:10:09,607 --> 00:10:14,012
MAN, SHE COMES UP WITH PHRASES
AND EXPRESSIONS THAT WOULD PUT
SHAKESPEARE TO SHAME.

204
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,516
NOW, SCIENTISTS TELL US THAT
WOMEN ACTUALLY HAVE MORE
SPACE IN THEIR BRAIN
FOR VERBAL SKILLS.

205
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,052
BUT, GUYS, I GOT
THE GREAT EQUALIZER.

206
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:25,089
TWO WORDS THAT WILL STOP ANY
ARGUMENT COLD IN ITS TRACKS...

207
00:10:25,156 --> 00:10:28,226
"YES, DEAR!"

208
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:31,429
OH, YEAH, IF SHE SAYS A SENTENCE
THAT KIND OF GOES UP AT THE END,

209
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:35,633
TWO OUT OF THREE TIMES,
"YES, DEAR" IS THE
PERFECT ANSWER.

210
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,604
OR YOU GET A LONG PAUSE...
IN A CONVERSATION,

211
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:43,541
YOU JUST DROP "YES, DEAR"
RIGHT IN THERE.

212
00:10:43,608 --> 00:10:47,378
BUT LISTEN, NEVER USE
"YES, DEAR" IF HER
SENTENCE STARTS,

213
00:10:47,445 --> 00:10:52,383
"YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS?"

214
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,386
NOW, I KNOW SOME GUYS PREFER
TOTAL SILENCE AS A RESPONSE,

215
00:10:55,453 --> 00:10:57,355
BUT I DON'T RECOMMEND IT,

216
00:10:57,422 --> 00:10:59,957
BECAUSE TO HAVE TOTAL SILENCE,
YOU HAVE TO BE ALL ALONE.

217
00:11:00,024 --> 00:11:03,027
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS.

218
00:11:03,094 --> 00:11:04,929
SO, "YES, DEAR" IS BAD
ENOUGH IN PERSON,

219
00:11:04,996 --> 00:11:06,264
IT'S MUCH WORSE OVER THE PHONE,

220
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:09,367
AND A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE
THROUGH YOUR LAWYER.

221
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:11,302
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

222
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:13,371
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

223
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:16,741
(APPLAUSE)

224
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,511
HERE'S A TIP FOR YOU
RACING GUYS OUT THERE.

225
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:22,213
WHEN YOU'VE BEEN TO
THE SOAP BOX DERBY,

226
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,017
GET THE BIGGEST WHEELS
YOU CAN GET.

227
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:29,454
I TELL YOU, MOOSE THOMPSON, HE
USED GROCERY CART WHEELS.

228
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,690
THEY GOT SO HOT THEY BURNED ALL
THE HAIR OFF HIS LEGS.

229
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:38,463
NOW, LUCKILY HIS NATURAL BODILY
FUNCTIONS PUT OUT THE FIRE
BEFORE IT SPREAD TO HIS BACK.

230
00:11:40,998 --> 00:11:43,367
SO I'M GOING TO USE
BICYCLE WHEELS ON MINE.

231
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:45,203
HEY, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA.

232
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:47,305
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE IN
THE BIG GUY LITTLE GUY CLUB

233
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:48,973
DOESN'T MEAN YOU GET TO
BE IN THE DERBY RIGHT AWAY.

234
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,708
YOU HAVE TO HAVE
A LITTLE GUY.

235
00:11:50,775 --> 00:11:54,812
AND, SO FAR, NO KID IN THE
POSSUM LAKE AREA WANTS
TO BE WITH YOU.

236
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:56,414
WELL, HOW COME,
HAROLD?

237
00:11:56,481 --> 00:11:59,016
WELL, SOMEONE SAID THAT
YOU'RE TOO BOSSY,

238
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:02,620
AND YOU DON'T THINK,
AND YOU DON'T LISTEN,
AND YOU DO DANGEROUS STUFF.

239
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,989
WHO TOLD 'EM THAT?

240
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:09,927
THAT'S NOT THE POINT, REALLY.

241
00:12:10,928 --> 00:12:12,897
COME ON. THERE'S GOT TO
BE SOME KID THAT WOULD
DO IT, HAROLD.

242
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:14,232
YOU KNOW WHAT
WE'LL DO?

243
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:16,167
WE'LL SWEETEN THE POT
A LITTLE BIT.

244
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:18,169
LET THE GUY JOIN THE LODGE,
AND HE CAN FIX THE BOATS,
WASH THE CARS.

245
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:20,171
KIDS LOVE DOING
THAT KIND OF --

246
00:12:20,238 --> 00:12:22,573
WELL, HOW ABOUT SPENDING
A LITTLE TIME WITH THE
LITTLE GUY, HUH?

247
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,908
MAYBE DO THINGS THAT
HE'S INTERESTED IN,

248
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:27,311
LIKE PLAYING SPORTS OR
GOING TO ROCK CONCERTS.

249
00:12:27,378 --> 00:12:30,147
YOU KNOW, HAROLD, WHEN
I WAS A KID, I HAD TO DO
WHATEVER THE ADULTS WANTED.

250
00:12:30,214 --> 00:12:33,417
AND NOW THAT I'M AN ADULT,
YOU WANT ME TO DO WHAT
THE KIDS WANT.

251
00:12:33,484 --> 00:12:37,121
FORGET IT. YOU'RE NOT CHANGING
THE RULES ON ME NOW, BUDDY.

252
00:12:37,188 --> 00:12:38,322
WELL, I'M SORRY,
UNCLE RED,

253
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:42,126
BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A
LITTLE GUY TO BE IN THE DERBY.

254
00:12:42,193 --> 00:12:43,461
WELL, ALL RIGHT.
I TELL YOU WHAT,

255
00:12:43,527 --> 00:12:46,330
I'LL PAY HIM $10.

256
00:12:46,397 --> 00:12:48,032
I DON'T KNOW.
$10 MIGHT NOT DO IT.

257
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:52,269
WELL, I'LL PAY MORE
IF HE'LL TAKE A CHEQUE.

258
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:55,740
(APPLAUSE)

259
00:12:58,409 --> 00:13:01,012
THIS IS THE ONLY RADIO STATION
IN THE WHOLE POSSUM LAKE AREA;

260
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:04,849
OWNED, OPERATED, HOSTED, BUILT
AND PARTIALLY PAID FOR
BY SPARKY HOOVER.

261
00:13:04,915 --> 00:13:07,318
HE LETS THE LODGE ADVERTISE FOR
FREE, AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

262
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:09,153
SO HOW'S
IT GOING, SPARK?

263
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,655
OH, OH, SORRY, SORRY.

264
00:13:11,856 --> 00:13:14,892
AND THAT WAS 'SMOOCHY
AND THE WET ONES' SINGING

265
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,962
"I NEVER SEEN A GIRL
WITH ONE OF THOSE."

266
00:13:18,028 --> 00:13:19,697
(SOUND OF TYPEWRITER)

267
00:13:19,764 --> 00:13:21,932
(IN 'REPORTER' VOICE)
TIME NOW FOR THE HOOVER REPORT

268
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:25,669
WHERE YOUR HOST SPARKY HOOVER
TACKLES THE TOUGH POLITICAL AND
CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES OF THE DAY.

269
00:13:25,736 --> 00:13:30,040
JOINING SPARKY TODAY IS RED
GREEN, LOCAL LODGE LEADER
AND A BIT OF AN ODD BALL,

270
00:13:30,107 --> 00:13:33,911
BUT AT LEAST HE'S
NOT ONE OF "THEM"!

271
00:13:33,978 --> 00:13:35,212
SPARKY.

272
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,515
(NORMAL VOICE)
HEY, YEAH, THANKS A LOT, JASON.

273
00:13:37,581 --> 00:13:39,016
AND HELLO TO RED GREEN.

274
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,985
HOW ARE YOU?

275
00:13:41,051 --> 00:13:43,420
WELL, I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED,
I GUESS, SPARKY.

276
00:13:43,487 --> 00:13:45,256
HOW'S THE SCHOOL BUS
DRIVING GOING?

277
00:13:45,322 --> 00:13:47,458
OH, IT'S FINE.

278
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:51,262
MAINLY IT KEEPS "THEM"
FROM GETTING ME!

279
00:13:51,328 --> 00:13:55,065
YOU KNOW, THEY'D NEVER BLOW
UP A BUSLOAD OF KIDS
JUST TO GET TO ME.

280
00:13:55,132 --> 00:13:57,968
FIGHT THE POWER!

281
00:13:58,035 --> 00:14:01,539
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN
THAT THERE, SPARK?

282
00:14:01,605 --> 00:14:03,507
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO CLEAN
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR.

283
00:14:03,574 --> 00:14:04,808
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

284
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,511
Sparky:  WELL, YEAH.
WELL, THAT'S BRIAN.

285
00:14:07,578 --> 00:14:10,848
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO TAKE HIM HOME.

286
00:14:10,915 --> 00:14:12,783
I'LL DO IT LATER.
RIGHT.

287
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,118
NOW I'VE GOT
THE SHOW TO DO.

288
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:16,220
YOU KNOW, RED,
THIS ISN'T JUST RADIO,

289
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:18,722
IT'S HAM RADIO!

290
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:20,758
THAT'S A MARRIAGE MADE IN
HEAVEN, I WOULD THINK.

291
00:14:20,824 --> 00:14:23,761
ALL RIGHT, ALL YOU
HAM OPERATORS OUT THERE,

292
00:14:23,827 --> 00:14:25,896
I WANT YOU TO JOIN
US ON THE AIR.

293
00:14:25,963 --> 00:14:27,197
HIT YOUR TALK BUTTONS,

294
00:14:27,264 --> 00:14:29,566
AND LET'S RAP ABOUT
POLITICS AND WHATNOT.

295
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:34,438
YEAH, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
NUMBER ONE ISSUE THAT
PLAGUES US ALL.

296
00:14:34,505 --> 00:14:36,707
U.F.O.s!

297
00:14:36,774 --> 00:14:37,908
Male voice:  YEAH,
HELLO, SPARKY?

298
00:14:37,975 --> 00:14:39,810
THIS IS, SPARKY.

299
00:14:39,877 --> 00:14:42,579
Male Voice:  LISTEN, CAN YOU
TURN YOUR SIGNAL DOWN?

300
00:14:42,646 --> 00:14:45,349
I'M GETTING YOUR
SHOW ON MY FILLINGS,

301
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:48,686
AND YOUR TOWER JUST
MICROWAVED MY COW.

302
00:14:48,752 --> 00:14:52,156
AND, OH, BY THE WAY, SPARKY,
COULD YOU BRING BRIAN HOME?

303
00:14:52,222 --> 00:14:56,493
HE'S GOT FATHER AND SON
CHESS CLUB TONIGHT.

304
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,961
IT'S THE C.I.A.
YEAH?

305
00:14:58,028 --> 00:15:00,698
A TRICK TO GET ME
OFF THE AIR.
OH, YEAH?

306
00:15:00,764 --> 00:15:02,433
JUST ACT NORMAL.

307
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:04,101
YOU CAN DO THAT?

308
00:15:09,273 --> 00:15:12,976
OBVIOUSLY A NATURE-ORIENTED
ADVENTURE WITH BILL THIS WEEK.

309
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:14,778
HE'S OUT THERE TRYING TO GET
HIMSELF A BUTTERFLY,

310
00:15:14,845 --> 00:15:16,013
AND I JUST JOINED HIM.

311
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,415
I'M HERE, BILL.
I'M HERE.

312
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:20,451
I MEAN, THE VAN IS RIGHT HERE.

313
00:15:20,517 --> 00:15:23,687
KIND OF HARD TO BELIEVE THAT
HE'S GOING TO CATCH A BUTTERFLY
IF HE CAN'T SEE A VAN.

314
00:15:23,754 --> 00:15:25,088
HERE HE COMES.

315
00:15:25,155 --> 00:15:26,523
YOU OKAY, BILL?
YEP, HE'S FINE.

316
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:29,693
YEP, I KNOW. OH!

317
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,829
BOY, I'M SO GLAD I CAME.

318
00:15:31,895 --> 00:15:33,864
WELL, THERE'S A BUTTERFLY
SITTING RIGHT THERE.

319
00:15:33,931 --> 00:15:35,566
BILL, SNEAK UP.

320
00:15:35,632 --> 00:15:38,502
WELL, THAT'S A BIGGER NUT,
ISN'T IT, BILL?

321
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:41,905
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. I GUESS
HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.

322
00:15:41,972 --> 00:15:45,342
OH, BOY! OH, LOOK.

323
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:46,944
I'M NOT TOUCHING HIM.

324
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,946
OKAY, THERE YOU GO.

325
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:53,917
THE BEST THING TO DO HERE
IS JUST KIND OF WAIT
THIS OUT, I THINK.

326
00:15:53,984 --> 00:16:00,324
BOY, MAYBE I'LL TAKE HIM BACK
TO THE LODGE AND MIX
SOME PAINT.

327
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,326
OH, THERE IT IS.
OH, HE GOT IT.

328
00:16:02,392 --> 00:16:05,095
YOU GOT -- BILL, YOU GOT IT.
YOU GOT HER. YOU GOT HER.

329
00:16:05,162 --> 00:16:06,363
ALL RIGHT. GOOD. EXCELLENT.

330
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,065
OH!

331
00:16:08,131 --> 00:16:10,033
OKAY. YOU'VE
GOT THE BUTTERFLY,

332
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,802
AND WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO NOW?

333
00:16:11,868 --> 00:16:13,437
OH, THAT'S ETHER.
ETHER.

334
00:16:13,503 --> 00:16:16,373
HE'S KIND OF THE ETHER BUNNY.

335
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,643
PUT THAT ON THE BUTTERFLY,
AND ADD IT TO -- DON'T PUT IT
UNDER THERE, BILL.

336
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,913
NO, NO, YOU DON'T WANT
YOUR ARMPIT GOING TO SLEEP.

337
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:28,318
OH! OH, A LITTLE BIT OF
THAT ON THE BUTTERFLY.

338
00:16:28,385 --> 00:16:32,723
OH! OH! ALL RIGHT.
KIDS, DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME.

339
00:16:39,396 --> 00:16:41,832
LATER THAT DAY...

340
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:44,968
I PUT THE MIRROR BACK ON THE
VAN AND HERE COMES THE
BUTTERFLY AGAIN.

341
00:16:45,035 --> 00:16:47,571
OH!

342
00:16:47,637 --> 00:16:50,907
FLY'S NOT EVEN ON
THAT SIDE OF MY PANTS.

343
00:16:50,974 --> 00:16:54,211
ALL RIGHT, I'M GETTING
OUT OF THERE.

344
00:16:54,277 --> 00:16:55,812
I'VE HAD ENOUGH.
THANKS, BILL.

345
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:59,216
NOT REALIZING THE BUTTERFLY
WAS ON MY TRAILER HITCH,

346
00:16:59,282 --> 00:17:01,618
AND, IN ONE FELL SWOOP,
BILL GRABS IT.

347
00:17:01,685 --> 00:17:03,987
OH, I GUESS I DIDN'T NOTICE.

348
00:17:04,054 --> 00:17:05,989
GEE, I FEEL BAD
ABOUT THIS.

349
00:17:06,056 --> 00:17:08,258
OH, MY GOSH, THERE'S A LOG.

350
00:17:08,325 --> 00:17:10,894
I'LL JUST STRADDLE THAT.

351
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:14,131
OH, LOOK, BILL HAS
A KNOT IN HIS HAIR.

352
00:17:14,197 --> 00:17:16,600
OH, I BETTER GO BACK AND MAKE
SURE HE'S ALL RIGHT.

353
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,568
YOU KNOW HOW HE GETS.

354
00:17:18,635 --> 00:17:20,837
YOU'RE FINE.
OH, SURE, YOU'RE FINE.

355
00:17:20,904 --> 00:17:22,305
YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET
THAT SHOE ON.

356
00:17:22,372 --> 00:17:24,407
LOOK, BILL, I'VE GOT SOME
GREAT NEWS FOR YOU.

357
00:17:24,474 --> 00:17:26,676
YOU KNOW, YOU THOUGHT
YOU HAD GIVEN UP.

358
00:17:26,743 --> 00:17:28,178
YOU THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
GOING TO CATCH IT.

359
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:29,613
THAT SAYS DODGE,

360
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,414
BUT THE BUTTERFLY FORGOT TO.

361
00:17:37,153 --> 00:17:38,388
WELL, YEAH, YEAH.

362
00:17:38,455 --> 00:17:40,056
HE NEEDS A LITTLE
GUY RIGHT AWAY

363
00:17:40,123 --> 00:17:42,392
BECAUSE HE WANTS TO BE
IN THE SOAP BOX DERBY.

364
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:46,730
WELL, YEAH! WELL, YEAH, OF
COURSE, HE'S IN THE BIG GUY
LITTLE GUY CLUB.

365
00:17:46,796 --> 00:17:48,431
YEAH, RED GREEN.

366
00:17:48,498 --> 00:17:50,567
THAT'S RIGHT. YEAH, RED GREEN
OF THE POSSUM LODGE.

367
00:17:50,634 --> 00:17:52,335
(DIAL TONE)

368
00:17:52,402 --> 00:17:53,570
HELLO? HELLO?

369
00:17:55,906 --> 00:17:57,641
I DON'T LIKE TO BRAG,

370
00:17:57,707 --> 00:18:00,477
BUT I THINK I MAY HAVE BUILT
THE ULTIMATE SOAP BOX
LITTLE UNIT THERE.

371
00:18:00,543 --> 00:18:02,979
UNBELIEVABLE.
SHE'S AERODYNAMIC,
ALMOST FRICTIONLESS.

372
00:18:03,046 --> 00:18:04,748
SHE'S LIGHT, AND SHE IS QUICK!

373
00:18:04,814 --> 00:18:08,184
I TELL YOU, WHEN THEY FIRE THAT
STARTER PISTOL AT THE TOP OF
CARDIAC HILL,

374
00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:12,389
THAT LITTLE CAR IS GOING TO GO
DOWN FASTER THAN A LARGE DRAFT
AT CLOSING TIME.

375
00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:18,128
SO, HAROLD, WHO'S THE LUCKY
LITTLE GUY WHO'LL JOIN ME
IN THE WINNER'S CIRCLE?

376
00:18:18,194 --> 00:18:21,531
WELL, THAT'S THE INTERESTING
THING BECAUSE SO FAR --

377
00:18:21,598 --> 00:18:23,767
WELL, NOBODY.

378
00:18:24,534 --> 00:18:26,136
DID YOU TELL THEM
I'D PAY THEM $10?

379
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:31,141
YES, I DID. BUT MOST OF THEM
PUT A MUCH HIGHER VALUE ON
THEIR LIFE THAN THAT.

380
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:33,343
YOU KNOW WHAT, HAROLD?
YOU GOT ME INTO THIS,

381
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,545
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO BE MY LITTLE GUY.

382
00:18:35,612 --> 00:18:38,581
NO! NO WAY! NO! NO!

383
00:18:38,648 --> 00:18:39,616
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S GONNA WORK.

384
00:18:39,682 --> 00:18:41,051
I DON'T PAY
YOU TO THINK.

385
00:18:41,117 --> 00:18:41,918
YOU DON'T PAY ME.

386
00:18:41,985 --> 00:18:43,653
THEN IT WILL
SAVE ME $10.

387
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,424
(APPLAUSE)

388
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:52,695
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TEENAGERS
OUT THERE WHO PLAY THE VIDEO
GAMES AND THE COMPUTER GAMES

389
00:18:52,762 --> 00:18:56,232
BECAUSE YOU MAY BE READY FOR
THE ULTIMATE 3-D EXPERIENCE.

390
00:18:56,299 --> 00:18:58,067
IT'S CALLED REALITY. HUH?

391
00:18:58,134 --> 00:19:02,205
REALITY COMES WITH ITS OWN
HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE,

392
00:19:02,272 --> 00:19:04,674
AND IT'S FULLY
COMPATIBLE WITH YOU.

393
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:08,178
NOW, SEE, THE IDEA OF THE GAME
IS YOU WORK YOURSELF AROUND THIS
PLACE CALLED EARTH,

394
00:19:08,244 --> 00:19:12,115
HOPING THAT YOU DON'T SCREW
UP SO BAD THAT YOU EMBARRASS
YOURSELF AND YOUR FRIENDS.

395
00:19:12,182 --> 00:19:15,518
AND TAKE IT FROM ME,
IT'S A LOT HARDER
THAN IT SOUNDS.

396
00:19:15,585 --> 00:19:17,754
ANYWAY, I THOUGHT I WOULD
GIVE YOU A FEW TIPS;

397
00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:20,390
MAYBE HELP YOU GET TO THE
ADVANCED LEVELS, ALL RIGHT?

398
00:19:20,456 --> 00:19:22,358
YOU KNOW WHEN THOSE VIDEO
CHARACTERS IN THOSE VIDEO GAMES,

399
00:19:22,425 --> 00:19:25,628
WHEN THEY GET BLOWN TO BITS,
THEY JUST KIND OF BOUNCE
RIGHT BACK?

400
00:19:25,695 --> 00:19:27,897
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE TRYING
THAT IN REALITY, OKAY?

401
00:19:27,964 --> 00:19:29,966
MAKES FOR A SHORT GAME.

402
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:33,303
AND YOU KNOW ON THE VIDEO GAMES,
IT'S EASY TO RECOGNIZE
THE BAD GUYS?

403
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:37,941
WELL, SEE, NOW, IN REALITY,
SOMETIMES THE BAD GUYS ARE
GOOD AND THE GOOD GUYS ARE BAD,

404
00:19:38,007 --> 00:19:40,476
SO DON'T BE SHOOTING OR
LASER BLASTING ANYBODY

405
00:19:40,543 --> 00:19:43,613
BECAUSE YOU MAY NEED THEIR
HELP BEFORE THE GAME IS OVER.

406
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,416
OF COURSE, NOW, YOU CAN SAVE THE
VIDEO GAMES, CAN'T YOU?

407
00:19:46,482 --> 00:19:47,951
TRY AGAIN.

408
00:19:48,017 --> 00:19:50,320
REALITY DOESN'T HAVE
A SAVE BUTTON.

409
00:19:50,386 --> 00:19:53,823
ALTHOUGH IT DOES HAVE A LITTLE
WRINKLE CALLED CONSEQUENCES.

410
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,391
REALITY IS A GOOD GAME.

411
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,759
YOU MIGHT WANT TO
TRY IT SOMETIME.

412
00:19:56,826 --> 00:19:57,927
BUT LET ME WARN YOU,

413
00:19:57,994 --> 00:20:01,297
IT'S EXPENSIVE.

414
00:20:05,268 --> 00:20:09,339
WELL, HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE WE
DID AT THE SOAP BOX DERBY?

415
00:20:11,841 --> 00:20:21,150
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

416
00:20:21,217 --> 00:20:26,322
BY GOLLY. OH! WHAT A MACHINE!

417
00:20:26,389 --> 00:20:27,523
BOY, DID THAT BABY --

418
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,991
I'VE GOT TO GIVE HAROLD
A LOT OF CREDIT.

419
00:20:29,058 --> 00:20:32,195
HE DROVE A HECK OF A RACE
DESPITE THE FEAR.

420
00:20:32,261 --> 00:20:38,234
YOU KNOW, I NEVER REALIZED
THE HUMAN EYEBALL COULD
OPEN THAT WIDE.

421
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:44,240
OH, NOW, HAROLD --
HAROLD, HAROLD,

422
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:49,545
THAT WAS REALLY SMART
USING POSSUM LAKE TO STOP
YOURSELF LIKE THAT.

423
00:20:49,912 --> 00:20:52,014
HEY, LOOK. WE WON!

424
00:20:56,986 --> 00:20:58,721
I DON'T WANT TO BE
YOUR PARTNER ANYMORE.

425
00:20:58,788 --> 00:21:00,256
COME ON, NOW, HAROLD,
THAT WAS GREAT.

426
00:21:00,323 --> 00:21:01,891
THAT TOOK A LOT OF
NERVE TO GO THAT FAST.

427
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,793
OH, WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

428
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:08,431
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, IT WAS
QUITE EASY CONSIDERING THE
VEHICLE HAD NO BRAKES.

429
00:21:08,498 --> 00:21:09,899
BUT I HAD TO KEEP
THE WEIGHT DOWN.

430
00:21:09,966 --> 00:21:14,237
OKAY. FINE. BUT HOW HEAVY
CAN STEERING BE?

431
00:21:14,303 --> 00:21:17,874
WELL, NOW THAT WAS --
WE HAD A HARD FIGHT
ON THAT ONE.

432
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,542
WE HAD A LOT OF COMPETITION
IN THAT RACE...

433
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:21,844
BUSTER HATFIELD
PRETENDING HE WAS A KID.

434
00:21:21,911 --> 00:21:26,349
AND JUNIOR SINGLETON WAS HIDING
DOWN IN HIS CAR PUMPING ON THE
PEDALS TO MAKE IT GO FASTER.

435
00:21:26,415 --> 00:21:28,017
WERE THEY THE ONES
THAT HIT THE FENCE?

436
00:21:28,084 --> 00:21:29,452
OH, YEAH.

437
00:21:29,518 --> 00:21:32,221
YEAH, RIPPED ALL
THEIR CLOTHES OFF.

438
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,724
YOU COULD SURE TELL
THE BIG GUY FROM
THE LITTLE GUY.

439
00:21:35,658 --> 00:21:37,827
(POSSUM CALL)

440
00:21:37,894 --> 00:21:39,262
MEETING TIME, UNCLE RED.

441
00:21:39,328 --> 00:21:41,130
YOU GO AHEAD, HAROLD.
I'LL BE DOWN IN A SEC.

442
00:21:41,197 --> 00:21:43,966
I THINK I
ALREADY WENT.

443
00:21:45,835 --> 00:21:48,271
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING,
