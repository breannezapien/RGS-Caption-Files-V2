BUT UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN I
GOT OVER TO THE OUTLET,

307
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:29,560
WHICH ONLY HAD THE ONE, THERE
WAS SOMETHING PLUGGED IN.

308
00:15:29,626 --> 00:15:31,428

IS PLUGGED IN THERE?

AND IT'S AN EXTENSION CORD,

WANNA JUST UNPLUG IT.

AT THE OTHER END.

NOTHING THERE.

THE HECK THIS GOES?

00:15:40,304 --> 00:15:43,507
AND I COME AROUND AND
THINKING WHAT THE HECK --

315
00:15:43,574 --> 00:15:45,175
OH, THERE WE GO.
THERE'S A LAWN MOWER.

316

THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD SIZE

COMING UP OVER THE FENCE
THERE AND ALL THE WRECK,

321
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:03,126
AND THEN GOES RIGHT
ACROSS THE ROAD THERE

322
00:16:03,193 --> 00:16:05,996
AND UP INTO THE BUSH,
AND I'M THINKING,
HOLY COW.

I DIDN'T SEE
WALTER COMING ALONG,

UP TO GO THROUGH THE BUSH.

IT AS A CLOTHESLINE.

BUT IT'S STILL NOT THE END.
IT JUST KEEPS GOING.

330

ALONG A LITTLE FARTHER.

CLOSE TO WHOEVER'S USING IT.

DON'T HAVE THE END OF IT,

OF HIS STORE.

HAVE TO GO UP ON THE ROOF
