1
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:08,308
(Baby crying)

2
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,477
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

3
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:14,714
HERE'S THE MAN VOTED
MOST LIKELY TO HAVE A T.V. SHOW

4
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:17,417
BASED IN A LODGE
NAMED AFTER A POSSUM,

5
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:18,918
YOUR HOST, MY UNCLE,

6
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:20,954
RED GREEN!

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:26,593
(Applause and cheering)

8
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:28,595
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

9
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:30,530
I GOT NO TIME FOR YACKING.

10
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,098
WE'VE GOT TO GET BUSY

11
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,033
ON OUR ANNUAL POSSUM LODGE

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,768
FATHER AND SON BANQUET.

13
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:37,871
EXCUSE ME --
TIMES HAVE CHANGED.

14
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:39,739
THE BANQUET SHOULD INCLUDE

15
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:42,609
MOMS AND SONS,
AND FATHERS AND DAUGHTERS.

16
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:44,110
FAIR ENOUGH, HAROLD.

17
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:47,881
WE'RE HAVING THE FATHER AND SON,
FATHER AND DAUGHTER,

18
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:50,617
MOM AND SON,
MOM AND DAUGHTER BANQUET.

19
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:52,619
EVERYTHING EXCEPT
UNCLES AND NEPHEWS.

20
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:54,120
SORRY, HAROLD.

21
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,623
THAT'S OK,
'CAUSE MY DAD'S COMING.

22
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,124
BUT THANKS FOR ASKING.

23
00:00:58,191 --> 00:00:59,626
I WASN'T ASKING.

24
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:01,127
YEAH, YOU WERE.

25
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:02,562
I WASN'T ASKING.

26
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,063
I KNOW YOU WERE.

27
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,566
I WOULD GO IF I COULD,
BUT I CAN'T!

28
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,067
STOP ASKING!

29
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:09,569
I'M NOT ASKING!

30
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,070
THAT'S AN ASK.

31
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:12,505
ARE YOU GETTING MAD?

32
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,973
I AM.

33
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,642
(Horns honking)

34
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,152
(Quacking)

35
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:31,124
(Red): TODAY,
I GET A LITTLE TIRED,

36
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,825
SO I MAKE A BED OUT OF TIRES.

37
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:34,627
SEGUE IS MY MIDDLE NAME.

38
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,429
MIKE GETS OUT OF PRISON

39
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:37,930
LONG ENOUGH

40
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:39,632
TO PLAY TWO ON A MATCH.

41
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:43,503
EDGAR MONTROSE SHOWS YOU
THE QUICK WAY TO BARBECUE.

42
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,809
YOUR FATHER'S COMING
TO THE BANQUET?

43
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,378
WON'T THAT BE GREAT? --
WE'LL ENTER RACES

44
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,815
AND WALK AROUND,
DO FATHER AND SON STUFF.

45
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:58,351
MAYBE HE'LL FLASH
HIS IDENTIFICATION,

46
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:01,421
AND THEY'LL STOP CALLING YOU
THAT NAME.

47
00:02:01,487 --> 00:02:02,922
HERE'S HOPING.

48
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,924
WHAT'S THIS YEAR'S THEME?

49
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:07,860
THE COMMITTEE HAD A MEETING
LAST NIGHT.

50
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:09,529
WHO'S ON THAT?

51
00:02:09,595 --> 00:02:11,364
ME.

52
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:12,932
YOU'RE NOT
A FATHER.

53
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,434
I'M A SON.

54
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,536
AROUND HERE 50% IS A QUORUM.

55
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:19,906
SO WE DECIDED TO MAKE
THIS YEAR'S THEME TIRES,

56
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:21,941
ALL KINDS OF TIRES, HAROLD.

57
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:24,510
STEEL BELTED,
ALL-WEATHER RADIALS,

58
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,045
BIAS PLY, OFF-ROAD.

59
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:29,615
WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH TIRES
AT A FATHER AND SON BANQUET?

60
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,117
WAIT AND SEE.

61
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,953
IT WILL BE BETTER THAN
LAST YEAR'S THEME.

62
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,588
OH YEAH, BIG WHOOP.

63
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,790
SALUTE TO ENGINE COOLANT.

64
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,292
THAT WAS GROSS.

65
00:02:39,358 --> 00:02:44,397
WE WERE DOING OK TILL WE
USED IT FOR BOBBING FOR APPLES.

66
00:02:44,463 --> 00:02:48,034
(Red): BILL'S WAY AHEAD OF US
ON THE TIRE THEME.

67
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,037
HE'S GOING TO MAKE A SWING
OUT OF TIRES.

68
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:53,206
HE PICKED A TIRE
OUT OF THE PILE.

69
00:02:53,272 --> 00:02:54,707
OH, OH, OH, OH.

70
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:57,009
HE WANTED ME TO PICK ONE OUT,

71
00:02:57,076 --> 00:03:00,246
BUT I THOUGHT HE'D MADE
A HASTY DECISION.

72
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:03,549
I DECIDED HE'D MAKE
A BETTER DECISION IF HE HAD

73
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,384
MORE TIRES TO CHOOSE FROM.

74
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:08,621
SO, BILL, HOW 'BOUT THAT ONE
OR THESE OR THAT?

75
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,122
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?

76
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,757
HOW ABOUT THIS HERE?

77
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:13,259
HERE'S ONE.

78
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,760
HOW 'BOUT THIS?

79
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,996
OH, EXCELLENT CHOICE.

80
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,266
THIS IS THE BIG ONE!

81
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,536
THIS WEEK'S PRIZE WAS DONATED
BY JUNIOR SINGLETON.

82
00:03:23,602 --> 00:03:26,772
A PROMISE TO RETURN
HALF THE TOOLS HE'S BORROWED.

83
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:29,375
YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO MAKE MR. HAMMER

84
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,510
SAY THIS WORD.

85
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:33,446
THIRTY SECONDS, AND BEGIN.

86
00:03:33,512 --> 00:03:36,248
ALL RIGHT, MIKE, UH... BUDDY.

87
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:38,217
GANG MEMBER?

88
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,719
CLOSE BUDDY.

89
00:03:39,785 --> 00:03:41,220
CELL MATE.

90
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:44,623
UH, SOMEONE WHO
TALKS ABOUT STUFF.

91
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:49,662
UH, INFORMER, STOOLEY, SQUEALY,
UH... DEAD MEAT.

92
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,163
NO, NO,
NO.

93
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,366
SOMEONE YOU CAN TRUST.

94
00:03:53,432 --> 00:03:55,901
OH BOY, UM...

95
00:03:55,968 --> 00:03:57,570
PRISON CHAPLAIN.

96
00:03:57,636 --> 00:04:00,506
AND YOU CAN TRUST HIM
BECAUSE HE'S...

97
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,575
AN EX-CON HIMSELF.

98
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:04,910
(Audience laughing)

99
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:06,445
LET ME GO ANOTHER WAY.

100
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:08,848
I'M NOT JUST A GUY
WHO SIGNED YOU OUT

101
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:11,450
ON A PAROLE THING,
I'M ALSO YOUR BUDDY, YOUR...

102
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,452
WARDEN.

103
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,689
YOU'RE RUNNIN'
OUT OF TIME

104
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:19,658
MIKE, THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY
YOU CAN TRUST.

105
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:23,195
UM... BAMBI BAZOOMS,
THE FEATHER DANCER.

106
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:26,365
FAIR ENOUGH --
SO BAMBI IS YOUR...

107
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,334
MOM.

108
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,803
(Audience laughing)

109
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,037
(Strums acoustic guitar)

110
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:34,106
PEOPLE THOUGHT I WAS
LINE DANCING

111
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,108
WHEN I JUMPED UP
AND SPUN ON THE CHAIR

112
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:38,310
SO THEY JOINED IN
AND DID WHAT I DID

113
00:04:38,377 --> 00:04:40,112
KICKING ONE FOOT
IN THE AIR

114
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,147
WE DANCED IN A LINE
OUT THE FRONT DOOR

115
00:04:42,214 --> 00:04:44,083
AND DOWN BY
THE CEDAR GROVE

116
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:45,985
IT TURNED OUT I WASN'T
LINE DANCING AT ALL

117
00:04:46,051 --> 00:04:48,487
I HAD JUST STUBBED MY TOE
ON THE STOVE

118
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,122
OW!

119
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:53,125
IT'S TIME FOR THIS WEEK'S
SEGMENT OF

120
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,394
"THE FRIENDLY SIDE
OF DYNAMITE".

121
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,464
THIS WEEK WE'LL SHOW YOU
HOW TO USE DYNAMITE

122
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,965
FOR HOME RENOVATIONS.

123
00:05:00,032 --> 00:05:02,201
THE TRICK IS TO GET
THE DYNAMITE

124
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,803
INTO THE SHAPE
THAT WILL FIT THE JOB.

125
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,007
LOTS OF GUYS USE
EXPENSIVE PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES,

126
00:05:08,073 --> 00:05:10,242
BUT THEY GOT MORE MONEY
THAN ME,

127
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:13,412
PLUS THEY GOT
THE PROPER LICENCE AND PERMITS.

128
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,448
WHAT I DO IS JUST
CRACK A STICK OPEN,

129
00:05:16,515 --> 00:05:19,251
MIX IT WITH
SOME HAMBURGER MEAT...

130
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:22,087
THAT'S T.N.T. INSTEAD OF
M.S.G., RED.

131
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:25,924
YOU KNOW, THE ENGLISH
GOT THEIR BANGERS AND MASH.

132
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:27,426
THISS BOTH.

133
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,862
I GOT THIS DOOR
THAT'S BEEN STICKING.

134
00:05:29,928 --> 00:05:32,431
I NEED TO GIVE IT
A LITTLE ATTENTION.

135
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,932
COME ON WITH ME, RED.

136
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:36,035
ALL RIGHT.

137
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:39,004
COULDN'T YOU JUST PLANE
A BIT OFF THE DOOR,

138
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:40,939
OR SAND SOME OFF THE FRAME?

139
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:42,374
I KNOW I COULD.

140
00:05:42,441 --> 00:05:45,144
BUT I PREFER TO BLOW IT
TO KINGDOM-COME

141
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,712
AND START OVER AGAIN.

142
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,380
I'M FUSSY THAT WAY.

143
00:05:48,447 --> 00:05:51,717
NOW, YOU LAY YOUR BURGER
INTO THE HINGE.

144
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,852
AND THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH

145
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,889
TO BLOW HER HALFWAY
ACROSS THE LAKE.

146
00:05:56,955 --> 00:06:00,559
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO USE
TO SET OFF THE CHARGE?

147
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,294
BARBECUE STARTER?

148
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,062
ULTRASONIC WAVES, RED.

149
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:08,367
THIS BABY SENDS THEM OUT
AND TOUCHES OFF THE DYNAMITE.

150
00:06:08,433 --> 00:06:11,737
LOOKS LIKE YOUR
GARAGE DOOR OPENER, EDGAR.

151
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:14,740
WELL, TODAY IT'S
A SHED DOOR OPENER.

152
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:17,576
(Zapping)

153
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:21,914
HMM.

154
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,982
(Zapping)

155
00:06:26,485 --> 00:06:28,287
(Coughing)

156
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:32,257
THIS WEEK I THOUGHT
I'D CARRY ON WITH THE THEME OF

157
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:34,359
OUR FATHER-SON,
FATHER-DAUGHTER,

158
00:06:34,426 --> 00:06:36,762
MOTHER-SON,
MOTHER-DAUGHTER BANQUET,

159
00:06:36,828 --> 00:06:38,263
NAMELY, TIRES.

160
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,933
GIRLS TODAY,
THEY'RE CONCERNED WITH ECOLOGY.

161
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:43,335
THEY WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

162
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:47,506
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY WE MAKE
AN ENTIRE GIRL'S BEDROOM SUITE

163
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,141
OUT OF RECYCLED TIRES?

164
00:06:49,207 --> 00:06:51,009
GIRLS LIKE PRETTY THINGS.

165
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:54,212
I SUGGEST YOU GO WITH
THE WHITEWALL ON THAT.

166
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:57,883
THE FIRST THING WE COULD BUILD
IS A VANITY MIRROR.

167
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,218
YOU ALREADY GOT
THE FRAME ON THERE

168
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:01,820
WITH THE WHITE ACCENT.

169
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:05,757
FOR YOUR MIRROR, I SUGGEST
YOU GO WITH A MOON DISC.

170
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:07,726
IT'S GOT THE CURVE ON HER.

171
00:07:07,793 --> 00:07:09,728
IT MAKES WOMEN LOOK SLIM.

172
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:13,198
THEY APPRECIATE THAT,
ESPECIALLY 13-YEAR-OLD GIRLS

173
00:07:13,265 --> 00:07:15,400
GOING THROUGH
THAT CHUNKY STAGE.

174
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:17,669
WHY DON'T WE BUILD A DRESSER?

175
00:07:17,736 --> 00:07:21,840
FOR THAT, ALL YOU DO IS
STACK UP A BUNCH OF TIRES,

176
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:24,543
AND CUT A FOUR-INCH HOLE
IN EACH ONE

177
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:26,478
USING A CARPET KNIFE.

178
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:31,416
PERFECT.

179
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:33,618
ONCE YOU GOT THE HOLES CUT,

180
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:36,488
STICK PATCHES ON
TO COVER THE HOLES.

181
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:39,491
I PUT A WHEEL DISK
BETWEEN EVERY TIRE,

182
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:41,827
SO YOU GOT SHELVING IN THERE.

183
00:07:41,893 --> 00:07:44,429
YOU NEED SOME KIND OF A HINGE.

184
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:47,065
YOU COULD GLUE SOME FABRIC
ON THERE.

185
00:07:47,132 --> 00:07:49,634
OR, IF YOU LIKE THE LOOK
OF SILVER,

186
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:53,371
I SUGGEST THE HANDYMAN'S
SECRET WEAPON, DUCT TAPE.

187
00:07:53,438 --> 00:07:56,208
ONCE YOU'VE GOT
ALL YOUR FLAPS ON THERE,

188
00:07:56,274 --> 00:07:57,709
YOU CAN REACH IN,

189
00:07:57,776 --> 00:08:00,479
GET YOUR VARIOUS ARTICLES
OF CLOTHING.

190
00:08:00,545 --> 00:08:03,215
MAYBE YOU KEEP T-SHIRTS THERE,
AND...

191
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:05,283
NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

192
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,652
AND YOU GOT YOUR SOCKS.

193
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:11,056
LOOK AT HOW NEAT AND TIDY
THAT IS.

194
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:12,591
YOU CAN ALSO BUILD

195
00:08:12,657 --> 00:08:15,393
AN ATTRACTIVE AND USEFUL
GIRL'S DESK.

196
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,095
ISN'T THAT A BEAUTY?

197
00:08:17,162 --> 00:08:18,864
THIS IS A NICE TOUCH.

198
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,799
A BEAUTIFUL DESK LAMP.

199
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:22,734
YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS,

200
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:26,137
BUT THIS IS MADE OUT OF TIRES.

201
00:08:26,204 --> 00:08:29,441
WE CAN ALSO MAKE
A DANDY LITTLE GIRL'S BED.

202
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:31,743
WHAT DO WE USE
FOR A MATTRESS?

203
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,411
INNER TUBES MAKE SENSE.

204
00:08:33,478 --> 00:08:36,281
WHY DON'T WE ADD
A BIT OF ROMANCE?

205
00:08:36,348 --> 00:08:40,518
HOW ABOUT ONE OF THOSE
VICTORIAN FOUR-POSTER BEDS?

206
00:08:40,585 --> 00:08:43,088
GIRLS LOVE THAT KIND OF STUFF.

207
00:08:43,154 --> 00:08:46,858
WHAT CAN WE USE
FOR THE POSTS?

208
00:08:46,925 --> 00:08:48,927
(Screeching)

209
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:53,365
HOW ABOUT ONE OF THESE
REAR END UNITS

210
00:08:53,431 --> 00:08:56,034
WHICH YOU CAN GET FROM
PASSING VEHICLES

211
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:58,236
IF YOU DIG
A BIG ENOUGH POTHOLE.

212
00:08:58,303 --> 00:08:59,738
THERE WE GO.

213
00:08:59,804 --> 00:09:02,741
SO NOW WHEN YOUR TEENAGER
GETS TIRED,

214
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:05,410
SHE CAN JUST RETIRE
TO HER TIRES.

215
00:09:05,477 --> 00:09:07,879
LET'S SEE IF IT'S COMFORTABLE.

216
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:11,149
FOOLS RUSH IN
WHERE ANGELS FEAR THE TREAD.

217
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:13,218
OH BOY, OH.

218
00:09:13,284 --> 00:09:14,719
GOSH.

219
00:09:14,786 --> 00:09:16,321
NOW THAT IBEAUTIFUL.

220
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:19,824
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME

221
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:22,360
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

222
00:09:22,427 --> 00:09:25,897
AND TO THINK WE MADE THIS
OUT OF OLD REAR ENDS.

223
00:09:25,964 --> 00:09:27,699
ACTUALLY, YOU CAN TELL.

224
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:29,200
EDGAR SHOWS THAT

225
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:30,568
THE EXPLOSIVES BUSINESS

226
00:09:30,635 --> 00:09:31,970
HAS ITS UPS AND DOWNS.

227
00:09:35,473 --> 00:09:38,743
I KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS
ARE GOING THROUGH.

228
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,879
YOU GET UP ON
A SATURDAY MORNING,

229
00:09:40,945 --> 00:09:42,614
SWING OPEN THE CLOSET DOOR

230
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,949
AND YOU'RE FACE TO FACE
WITH CLOTHES

231
00:09:45,016 --> 00:09:47,418
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE
IN YOUR LIFE.

232
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:48,920
MEN'S CLOTHES.

233
00:09:48,987 --> 00:09:50,889
YOU RUN OVER TO THE BED

234
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:54,159
TO SEE IF YOUR WIFE'S
HAVING AN AFFAIR.

235
00:09:54,225 --> 00:09:56,694
BUT NO, IT'S WORSE THAN THAT.

236
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:59,430
SHE HAS BOUGHT YOU NEW CLOTHES.

237
00:09:59,497 --> 00:10:01,432
(Audience laughing)

238
00:10:01,499 --> 00:10:04,936
COLOURED GOLF SHIRTS,
AND THOSE JEANS FOR FAT GUYS

239
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:07,772
SO YOU CAN'T TELL HOW BIG
THEIR BUTT IS.

240
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,440
(Audience laughing)

241
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:12,677
ORDINARILY, YOU'D NEVER
WEAR CLOTHES LIKE THAT,

242
00:10:12,744 --> 00:10:15,313
BUT SHE'S THROWN OUT
YOUR OLD CLOTHES.

243
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,783
YOU KNOW THAT SWEATSHIRT YOU GOT
WHEN YOU WERE 14

244
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,451
AT CAMP KAPPAWIGGAMOGGAWEDGIE?

245
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:22,987
AND THOSE JEANS YOU'VE WORN
FOR 10 YEARS

246
00:10:23,054 --> 00:10:26,090
EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE GOT TO
HANG FROM THE CEILING

247
00:10:26,157 --> 00:10:27,859
TO GET YOUR GUT INTO THEM.

248
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:30,228
DON'T FIGHT IT --
USE YOUR HEAD.

249
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:33,298
A GUY WEARING NEW CLOTHES
CAN'T CUT THE GRASS,

250
00:10:33,364 --> 00:10:35,800
WASH THE CAR OR
TAKE OUT THE GARBAGE.

251
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:37,936
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

252
00:10:38,002 --> 00:10:39,971
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

253
00:10:46,477 --> 00:10:49,547
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS
WHAT WE FOUND, HAROLD,

254
00:10:49,614 --> 00:10:51,649
BEHIND LUCKY BALDERSON'S PLACE.

255
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:54,285
TIRE DUMP.

256
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:56,254
MUST BE FIVE ACRES OF TIRES.

257
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:58,056
NO WONDER THEY CALL HIM LUCKY.

258
00:10:58,122 --> 00:11:00,792
GOT ENOUGH TIRES
TO MAKE A GLOBAL VILLAGE.

259
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:03,461
WE'LL HAVE THE YOKAHAMAS
FROM JAPAN,

260
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:06,631
PIRELLIS FROM ITALY AND
FRISK TIRES FROM K-MART.

261
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:09,767
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU
THERE, HAROLD?

262
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:11,269
MY DAD CALLED.

263
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:13,137
CAN'T COME TO

264
00:11:13,204 --> 00:11:14,939
THE FATHER-SON BANQUET.

265
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:16,441
OH BOY.

266
00:11:16,507 --> 00:11:17,942
(Audience): AWW.

267
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:21,279
I'M GONNA CANCEL, UNCLE RED.

268
00:11:21,345 --> 00:11:23,381
CAN'T GO, I GUESS,
OR SOMETHING.

269
00:11:23,448 --> 00:11:26,551
HAVE TO FIND SOMEONE ELSE...
UNCLE... RED.

270
00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:30,221
YOU KNOW, SOMEONE IN MY FAMILY,
SOME OTHER RELATIVE.

271
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:32,890
I DON'T KNOW... UNCLE... RED.

272
00:11:32,957 --> 00:11:34,392
SOMEONE.

273
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:36,360
YOU KNOW, AS YOU'RE TALKING,

274
00:11:36,427 --> 00:11:40,031
IT STRIKES ME FUNNY THAT
DADS ARE SO MUCH LIKE TIRES.

275
00:11:40,098 --> 00:11:44,135
EVEN WHEN THEY GET OLD AND BALD
AND GOT BULGES IN THE SIDE,

276
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:46,404
THEY'RE STILL GOOD
FOR SOMETHING.

277
00:11:49,474 --> 00:11:51,309
AT THE FATHER-SON BANQUET.

278
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,911
SOUNDS GREAT, YEAH, GOOD,
SURE, GREAT.

279
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:56,747
TELL YOU WHAT,
I'LL THINK IT OVER.

280
00:11:56,814 --> 00:11:58,249
EXCELLENT, GOOD,
EXCELLENT, OK, GOOD!

281
00:11:58,316 --> 00:11:59,750
THAT'S GREAT!

282
00:11:59,817 --> 00:12:01,419
THAT WOULD BE PERFECT.

283
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:04,188
I'LL MAKE SURE THAT
I'M A GOOD GUY.

284
00:12:04,255 --> 00:12:06,924
I'LL MAKE YOU PROUD
TO BE WITH ME.

285
00:12:06,991 --> 00:12:08,926
I'LL BE CALM, SO CALM.

286
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:10,428
HA-HA HA!

287
00:12:10,494 --> 00:12:12,563
I'LL DRINK MY POP REALLY SLOW

288
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,933
BECAUSE LAST YEAR
I HAD THIS REALLY BIG BELCH.

289
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,935
THIS YEAR I WON'T DO THAT.

290
00:12:18,002 --> 00:12:19,937
I WON'T TALK A LOT.

291
00:12:20,004 --> 00:12:23,874
WHEN I TALK, I'LL MAKE SURE
IT'S SPECIFIC TOPICS

292
00:12:23,941 --> 00:12:27,378
OF INTEREST TO EVERYBODY,
NOT JUST MYSELF.

293
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:30,481
NOT TOPICS LIKE GIRLS,
OR HOW MUCH CANDY FLOSS

294
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:33,884
I CAN GET IN MY MOUTH
BEFORE IT COMES OUT MY NOSE.

295
00:12:33,951 --> 00:12:37,722
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT IT YET?

296
00:12:39,957 --> 00:12:41,692
OH, AH.

297
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,561
(Coughing)

298
00:12:43,628 --> 00:12:46,998
HI, THIS IS EDGAR MONTROSE
WITH A SAFETY TIP.

299
00:12:47,064 --> 00:12:50,401
WHENEVER YOU'RE SETTING UP
EXPLOSIVE CHARGES

300
00:12:50,468 --> 00:12:51,902
WITH YOUR PARTNER,

301
00:12:51,969 --> 00:12:54,338
ALWAYS WORK OUT
YOUR HAND SIGNALS

302
00:12:54,405 --> 00:12:56,407
BEFORE YOU LIGHT THE FUSE.

303
00:12:56,474 --> 00:12:58,909
(Coughing)

304
00:12:58,976 --> 00:13:00,411
WHAT?

305
00:13:00,478 --> 00:13:03,914
I TOLD YOU "FIVE," NOT--

306
00:13:03,981 --> 00:13:05,416
MY MISTAKE.

307
00:13:05,483 --> 00:13:06,917
THIS IS FIVE.

308
00:13:06,984 --> 00:13:08,419
THAT'S FOUR.

309
00:13:08,486 --> 00:13:10,921
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S SET IT UP AGAIN.

310
00:13:10,988 --> 00:13:13,324
AH.

311
00:13:15,993 --> 00:13:18,295
NOW WHAT DID YOU GO
AND DO THAT FOR?

312
00:13:18,362 --> 00:13:21,432
OF ALL THE INSENSITIVE THINGS
YOU'VE EVER DONE.

313
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:23,367
SHE'S DISCUSSING
THE RELATIONSHIP.

314
00:13:23,434 --> 00:13:27,371
SHE'S TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE,
ABOUT BEING TOGETHER,

315
00:13:27,438 --> 00:13:28,873
BUT BEING SCARED.

316
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:31,876
SHE'S POURING HER HEART OUT
TO YOU.

317
00:13:31,942 --> 00:13:35,246
AND YOU HAD TO GO AND YAWN.

318
00:13:35,312 --> 00:13:39,416
THE WORST THING
YOU COULD EVER DO.

319
00:13:39,483 --> 00:13:42,386
NEVER, EVER, EVER YAWN
AT YOUR WIFE.

320
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:43,888
AS IN NEVER.

321
00:13:43,954 --> 00:13:46,056
COULDN'T YOU HAVE
LEFT THE ROOM?

322
00:13:46,123 --> 00:13:48,259
ONE OF
THE MOST PERSONAL MOMENTS

323
00:13:48,325 --> 00:13:50,594
IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP,
AND YOU YAWN?

324
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:52,096
THIS IS A BIGGIE.

325
00:13:52,163 --> 00:13:56,901
WE'LL SHOW YOU A COUPLE OF WAYS
YOU CAN UNDO THE DAMAGE.

326
00:13:56,967 --> 00:14:00,337
FIRST, TELL HER
IT WASN'T A YAWN AT ALL.

327
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:02,206
IT WAS HER REVELATIONS

328
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:05,409
THAT LEFT YOU SLACK-JAWED
AND AMAZED,

329
00:14:05,476 --> 00:14:06,977
SORT OF LIKE...

330
00:14:10,481 --> 00:14:12,049
OR GO TO THE DOCTOR.

331
00:14:12,116 --> 00:14:15,586
CONVINCE HIM YOU'VE GOT
A SLEEPING DISORDER.

332
00:14:15,653 --> 00:14:18,923
ONCE SHE HEARS THAT,
SHE'LL BE FORGIVING.

333
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:21,892
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE
A LITTLE NEUROLOGICAL BLACKMAIL

334
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,194
TO GET YOU BACK IN
THE GOOD BOOKS.

335
00:14:24,261 --> 00:14:26,196
THEN YOU NEED A LITTLE PLAN.

336
00:14:26,263 --> 00:14:28,365
WE SAVED THE BEST ONE
FOR LAST.

337
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:29,867
TELL THEM.

338
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:31,368
ME?

339
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:33,871
YOU WAIT TILL
SHE'S REALLY TIRED.

340
00:14:33,937 --> 00:14:36,373
I MEAN ZONKED,
AND READY TO GO TO BED,

341
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,309
AND THEN YOU CALL HER ASIDE.

342
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:41,645
YOU SAY, "HONEY, I HAVE
SOME VERY IMPORTANT THINGS

343
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:43,180
"TO DISCUSS WITH YOU."

344
00:14:43,247 --> 00:14:46,417
THEN SIT HER DOWN
AND JUST START SPIELING.

345
00:14:46,483 --> 00:14:49,620
YOU JUST SHOOT THE BREEZE
ABOUT ANYTHING.

346
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:53,390
TALK ABOUT YOUR WRENCHES,
THE DOG, DOESN'T MATTER.

347
00:14:53,457 --> 00:14:54,892
JUST KEEP YACKING.

348
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,894
EVENTUALLY SHE'S GONNA YAWN.

349
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,896
(Audience laughing)

350
00:14:58,962 --> 00:15:00,397
EVENTUALLY?

351
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:03,734
WITH YOU GOING,
SHE'LL BE YAWNING IN SECONDS.

352
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:05,235
SO MUCH THE BETTER.

353
00:15:05,302 --> 00:15:08,739
AS SOON AS SHE YAWNS,
BLURT OUT SOMETHING PERSONAL.

354
00:15:08,806 --> 00:15:11,208
THEN YOU CAN TURN THE TABLES
ON HER.

355
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:12,709
BUT DON'T BLOW IT.

356
00:15:12,776 --> 00:15:16,814
REMEMBER, THIS IS
THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENT

357
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,583
OF THE REST OF
YOUR MARRIED--

358
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,318
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

359
00:15:21,385 --> 00:15:23,720
I WAS DOING THE THING HERE.

360
00:15:23,787 --> 00:15:25,856
IT WAS A COMPLETE YAWN.

361
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:28,592
NO, NO, I WASN'T YAWNING.

362
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:34,998
WELL, HAROLD,
I'LL PROBABLY REGRET THIS,

363
00:15:35,065 --> 00:15:37,034
BUT I'VE THOUGHT IT OVER.

364
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,303
YEAH, OK, YES, YES.

365
00:15:39,369 --> 00:15:42,372
WELL, YOU KNOW,
YOU ARE SORT OF FLESH AND BLOOD.

366
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:43,874
GO AHEAD,
GO AHEAD.

367
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:46,877
SEEING HOW YOUR DAD
CAN'T REALLY MAKE IT...

368
00:15:46,944 --> 00:15:48,879
MM-HMM,
MM-HMM.

369
00:15:48,946 --> 00:15:51,381
WELL, ALL RIGHT, HAROLD.

370
00:15:51,448 --> 00:15:54,384
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME
TO THE BANQUET WITH ME?

371
00:15:54,451 --> 00:15:56,220
NO, I CAN'T,
SORRY.

372
00:15:56,286 --> 00:15:58,155
(Audience laughing)

373
00:15:58,222 --> 00:16:00,190
I'M GOING WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

374
00:16:00,257 --> 00:16:01,959
WHAT?

375
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:05,896
A COUPLE OF KIDS WERE LOOKING
FOR A FATHER FIGURE, NAMELY ME.

376
00:16:05,963 --> 00:16:07,397
I'M GOING WITH THEM.

377
00:16:07,464 --> 00:16:09,533
YOU KNOW RICKY AND RONNIE.

378
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,969
THE RYTALIN BROTHERS?

379
00:16:12,035 --> 00:16:14,738
RITTLING, THE NAME'S RITTLING.

380
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:17,140
YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY'D PROBABLY ENJOY?

381
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:18,642
THE AIR DARE.

382
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:21,445
IT'S SORT OF LIKE THAT GAME
KA-BOOM,

383
00:16:21,511 --> 00:16:24,281
ONLY INSTEAD OF WITH
A WHIMPY BALLOON,

384
00:16:24,348 --> 00:16:27,851
WE BLOW UP AN INNER TUBE
FROM AN EARTH MOVER.

385
00:16:27,918 --> 00:16:31,455
YOU SEE HOW FAR YOU CAN
TAKE HER BEFORE SHE BLOWS.

386
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:35,525
IT GETS AROUND 200 POUNDS,
IT STARTS TO CRACKLE AND POP.

387
00:16:35,592 --> 00:16:39,029
GONNA TAKE A REAL MAN
TO TAKE HER OVER 210.

388
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:40,530
BUT
UNCLE RED,

389
00:16:40,597 --> 00:16:42,065
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

390
00:16:42,132 --> 00:16:46,036
KIDS DON'T WANT TO WATCH
SOMEBODY BLOW THEIR ARMS OFF.

391
00:16:46,103 --> 00:16:49,239
KIDS WANT TO DO SOMETHING
WITH THEIR FATHERS.

392
00:16:49,306 --> 00:16:53,009
YOU SHOULD FIND GAMES THAT
KIDS WILL BE INTERESTED IN.

393
00:16:53,076 --> 00:16:55,011
CANCEL THE AIR DARE?

394
00:16:55,078 --> 00:16:56,513
WHAT ABOUT WRENCH JUGGLING?

395
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,949
NOT A GOOD IDEA.

396
00:16:59,015 --> 00:17:02,919
AND YOU WONDER WHY
I DON'T HAVE KIDS.

397
00:17:02,986 --> 00:17:06,123
HERE'S A TIP FOR HANDYMEN
WHO KEEP LOSING TOOLS.

398
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:08,391
TAKE THE TOOLS YOU NEED
MOST OFTEN

399
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,994
AND TIE THEM WITH STRINGS
TO YOUR BELT.

400
00:17:11,061 --> 00:17:13,230
TODAY I'LL BE DOING
SOME PLUMBING,

401
00:17:13,296 --> 00:17:14,564
SO I GOT MY SOLDER.

402
00:17:14,631 --> 00:17:16,566
I GOT MY PIPE TAPE.

403
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:19,402
I GOT MY PIPE WRENCH.

404
00:17:19,469 --> 00:17:21,938
MY BAND-AIDS.

405
00:17:22,806 --> 00:17:26,409
(Red): MEANWHILE,
BACK AT THE TIRE SWING...

406
00:17:26,476 --> 00:17:28,245
(Explosion)

407
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:33,049
BILL WANTED TO TRY
THAT LITTLE TIRE.

408
00:17:33,116 --> 00:17:35,852
HE NEEDS TO THROW A ROPE
UP OVER...

409
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,354
WELL, THAT'S HANDY.

410
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,657
HE'S GOING TO THROW THAT UP
OVER THE BRANCH.

411
00:17:40,724 --> 00:17:42,359
GET THAT OUT OF THERE.

412
00:17:42,425 --> 00:17:46,363
YOU DON'T WANT THAT TO BE
SNUGGED UP AROUND...

413
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:48,865
GIVE IT A GOOD YANK.

414
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:51,801
I REALLY CAN'T...
I REALLY CAN'T EXPLAIN THAT.

415
00:17:51,868 --> 00:17:53,937
ANYWAY, HE GOT MY PIPE WRENCH

416
00:17:54,004 --> 00:17:56,773
WHICH I HAD FINISHED WITH,
AS YOU KNOW.

417
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,775
THAT GIVES IT A LITTLE WEIGHT.

418
00:17:58,842 --> 00:18:01,878
THIS IS KIND OF SMART,
AT LEAST IT SEEMED SMART.

419
00:18:01,945 --> 00:18:04,381
BUT YOU KNOW,
IT WASN'T REALLY THAT SMART.

420
00:18:04,447 --> 00:18:06,416
BOY, I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED.

421
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:09,252
HEY, BILL, WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE
HAPPENED?

422
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:11,888
DO YOU SUPPOSE IT WENT
OVER THE TREE?

423
00:18:11,955 --> 00:18:15,292
I THINK IT WENT SOMEWHERE
IT SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE.

424
00:18:15,358 --> 00:18:17,560
WHAT'S THAT WE HAVE HERE?

425
00:18:17,627 --> 00:18:19,062
MY, MY, MY.

426
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:20,563
LET'S SEE.

427
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,266
IS THAT SOMETHING
THAT BELONGS TO BILL?

428
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,802
I DON'T THINK SO, NO.

429
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:27,504
I THINK THAT'S MY DOOR.

430
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,273
HA!

431
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:34,411
WE'LL FIND OUT WHY HAROLD
LOOKS ODDER THAN USUAL.

432
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,920
OH, UNCLE RED, ENOUGH
WITH THE TIRES ALREADY.

433
00:18:43,987 --> 00:18:46,589
CAN'T HELP MYSELF, HAROLD.

434
00:18:46,656 --> 00:18:48,792
IT'S LIKE A CARNIVAL OUT THERE.

435
00:18:48,858 --> 00:18:52,295
WE GOT TIRE-TOSS GAMES,
TIRE OBSTACLE COURSES,

436
00:18:52,362 --> 00:18:53,797
TIRE SWINGS.

437
00:18:53,863 --> 00:18:57,300
WE BUILT A WHOLE BARBECUE
OUT OF WHITEWALLS.

438
00:18:57,367 --> 00:18:59,936
I GOT MOOSE THOMPSON
DRESSED IN TIRES.

439
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:02,005
HE'S ROLLO, THE RADIAL CLOWN.

440
00:19:02,071 --> 00:19:04,307
(Audience laughing)

441
00:19:04,374 --> 00:19:07,043
I'M ALMOST SORRY I HAVE TO
GO ON MY OWN.

442
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,179
I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

443
00:19:09,245 --> 00:19:12,982
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE FACT
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE KIDS.

444
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:16,553
THAT PROBABLY MAKES YOU,
YOU KNOW, THE WAY YOU ARE.

445
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:18,855
AN OLD CHUBBY GUY
WITH A BEARD,

446
00:19:18,922 --> 00:19:20,623
THAT'S PRETTY PATHETIC.

447
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,827
IS GOOD NEWS COMING SOON
IN THIS SPEECH?

448
00:19:23,893 --> 00:19:26,596
I FOUND SOMEBODY FOR YOU
TO TAKE.

449
00:19:26,663 --> 00:19:28,097
A FAKE SON?

450
00:19:28,164 --> 00:19:29,599
A FAKE DAD.

451
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,100
OLD MAN SEDGWICK.

452
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:33,836
I TOLD HIM YOU WERE HIS SON!

453
00:19:33,903 --> 00:19:36,039
WELL, THAT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT,

454
00:19:36,105 --> 00:19:39,342
AS LONG AS WE TELL EVERYBODY
THAT I'M ADOPTED.

455
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:40,843
OH YEAH.

456
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,879
HE INSISTED.

457
00:19:43,813 --> 00:19:46,316
(Red): HERE WE ARE
AT THE TIRE SWING.

458
00:19:46,382 --> 00:19:48,518
HE GOT THE ROPE OVER.

459
00:19:48,585 --> 00:19:50,019
OH!

460
00:19:50,086 --> 00:19:52,355
THIS IS MORE FUN NOW.

461
00:19:52,422 --> 00:19:53,856
(Laughing)

462
00:19:53,923 --> 00:19:56,359
NOW HE'S GOT THE ROPE OVER.

463
00:19:56,426 --> 00:19:57,860
OH, YOU'RE FINE.

464
00:19:57,927 --> 00:20:01,798
HE'S STILL INSISTING ON
GOING WITH THAT LITTLE TIRE.

465
00:20:01,864 --> 00:20:03,499
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, BILL?

466
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:05,635
HE'S GOING TO TRY
AND CUT A HOLE

467
00:20:05,702 --> 00:20:08,137
WITH
AN EXACTO-KNIFE-TYPE THING.

468
00:20:08,204 --> 00:20:10,807
OH, OH, OH!

469
00:20:10,873 --> 00:20:12,308
OH!

470
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,876
OHH!

471
00:20:13,943 --> 00:20:15,845
THERE ARE TIMES YOU WISH

472
00:20:15,912 --> 00:20:17,814
THIS SHOW WAS ON RADIO.

473
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,315
ANYWAY, HE'S FINE.

474
00:20:19,382 --> 00:20:21,317
GET RID OF THAT.

475
00:20:21,384 --> 00:20:23,720
WHY DON'T WE GO
THROUGH THE HOLE.

476
00:20:23,786 --> 00:20:25,655
THERE'S A NOVEL APPROACH.

477
00:20:25,722 --> 00:20:27,323
YEAH, YEAH, WE KNOW.

478
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,858
HE GETS THAT UP.

479
00:20:28,925 --> 00:20:31,561
IMAGINE YOU'RE WALKING
DOWN THE STREET.

480
00:20:31,627 --> 00:20:33,363
YOU GO BY THE PLAYGROUND.

481
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:36,833
YOU LOOK IN AND YOU SEE
SOMETHING OF THIS NATURE.

482
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:42,371
WOULD YOU PERHAPS CALL 9-1-1,
OR AN AMBULANCE OF SOME KIND,

483
00:20:42,438 --> 00:20:45,608
OR WOULD YOU JUST
START SHOOTING?

484
00:20:45,675 --> 00:20:48,277
OH, NO, NO, LOOK OUT, BILL.

485
00:20:48,344 --> 00:20:50,379
THAT KNIFE, THE KNIFE,
BILL, THE KNIFE.

486
00:20:50,446 --> 00:20:52,381
WELL, HE'S MOVING.

487
00:20:52,448 --> 00:20:54,183
OH, I SEE.

488
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,385
THE ROPE'S WINDING AROUND...

489
00:20:56,452 --> 00:20:58,554
YOU MIGHT BE...

490
00:20:58,621 --> 00:21:00,123
THIS MIGHT NOT WORK.

491
00:21:00,189 --> 00:21:01,557
(Crashing)

492
00:21:01,624 --> 00:21:03,059
THERE, HE STOPPED.

493
00:21:03,126 --> 00:21:04,393
OH, HERE HE COMES.

494
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,796
AHHH!

495
00:21:06,863 --> 00:21:10,299
WELL, THAT WAS A FUN RIDE,
WASN'T IT, BILL?

496
00:21:10,366 --> 00:21:11,801
YOU ALL RIGHT?

497
00:21:11,868 --> 00:21:13,302
OH.

498
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:15,371
WANT TO GO AGAIN?

499
00:21:22,378 --> 00:21:24,480
AND TO THINK, A FEW HOURS AGO

500
00:21:24,547 --> 00:21:27,783
I WAS ACTUALLY WISHING
I HAD A SON OF MY OWN.

501
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,887
COURSE, THAT WAS BEFORE
THE BIG TIRE FIRE.

502
00:21:30,953 --> 00:21:34,991
IT STARTED WHEN SOME PARENT
GAVE THEIR KID MATCHES.

503
00:21:35,057 --> 00:21:37,526
NOT ALWAYS THE KID'S FAULT,
YOU KNOW.

504
00:21:37,593 --> 00:21:40,830
OLD MAN SEDGWICK TOLD ME
TO START THE BARBECUE.

505
00:21:40,897 --> 00:21:44,834
(Audience laughing
and applauding)

506
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,469
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

507
00:21:46,535 --> 00:21:49,505
OK, BUT SHOULDN'T YOU
BE CALLING HIM DAD?

508
00:21:49,572 --> 00:21:52,241
A LOT OF THINGS
I SHOULD BE CALLING HIM.

509
00:21:52,308 --> 00:21:54,443
TO BE FAIR,
I THINK WE HAD MAYBE

510
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:57,346
TOO MANY TIRES PILED UP
AGAINST THE LODGE.

511
00:21:57,413 --> 00:21:59,415
BOY, CAN THOSE WHITEWALLS
BURN.

512
00:21:59,482 --> 00:22:01,751
I THOUGHT WE HAD HER
UNDER CONTROL,

513
00:22:01,817 --> 00:22:05,287
BUT THEN THE FIRE HIT
THE TIRE HIDE-AND-SEEK VILLAGE.

514
00:22:05,354 --> 00:22:07,523
NEXT YEAR WE OUGHT TO
PICK A THEME

515
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,558
THAT'S NOT SO...
F-F-FLAMMABLE.

516
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:12,528
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW FUN WORKS, DO YA?

517
00:22:12,595 --> 00:22:14,530
A WALL OF BURNING TIRES,

518
00:22:14,597 --> 00:22:17,033
AND BEING SURROUNDED
BY FLAMES,

519
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:21,470
AND RISKING LIFE AND LIMB
IS JUST NOT MY IDEA OF FUN.

520
00:22:21,537 --> 00:22:23,806
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

521
00:22:23,873 --> 00:22:25,307
(Possum
squeal)

522
00:22:25,374 --> 00:22:26,809
I GIVE UP.

523
00:22:26,876 --> 00:22:28,310
MEETING TIME.

524
00:22:28,377 --> 00:22:29,812
GO AHEAD, HAROLD.

525
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:33,682
I ACTUALLY KNOW THAT
A TIRE FIRE'S NOT FUN,

526
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:36,185
BUT WINDING HIM UP SURE IS.

527
00:22:36,252 --> 00:22:37,787
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

528
00:22:37,853 --> 00:22:40,322
I'LL BE COMING HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

529
00:22:40,389 --> 00:22:41,824
IT'S BEEN QUITE A DAY.

530
00:22:41,891 --> 00:22:43,592
I SMELL LIKE BURNT RUBBER.

531
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:45,728
YOU'VE GOT A NEW FATHER-IN-LAW.

532
00:22:45,795 --> 00:22:47,229
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

533
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:51,333
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF, HAROLD,
AND THE GANG AT POSSUM LODGE,

534
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,335
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

535
00:22:53,402 --> 00:22:55,404
(Applause)

536
00:22:57,706 --> 00:23:01,744
(Possum squeal)

537
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:03,279
(Harold): NO THROWING PLANES.

538
00:23:03,345 --> 00:23:05,114
OH, ALL RISE, ALL RISE.

539
00:23:05,181 --> 00:23:06,782
UP AND AT 'EM.

540
00:23:10,553 --> 00:23:13,155
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.
