YOU CAN'T FIND THE ANSWER

THEN LAST SUMMER THEY GOT
A GRANT TO SPRUCE UP DOWNTOWN,

193
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:52,831
SO THEY PUT UP SOME SPRUCE
AND TORE DOWN THE CLOCK.

NOW THEY GOT A BIG DIGITAL ONE
ON TOP OF CITY HALL.

PROBABLY BECAUSE IT
GOES UP EVERY MINUTE.

KIND OF LIKE THE IDEAL

YOU KNOW A CLOCK IS REALLY
JUST A BUNCH OF GEARS.

SO I WENT TO THE HIGHEST GEAR
TO GET THE MAXIMUM HORSEPOWER.

206
00:09:27,632 --> 00:09:30,168
THEN I RAN A L-O-ONG

THROUGH THE SUN ROOF AND DOWN

00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:55,593
THAT SHOULD MAKE
THE CLOCK WORK FINE.

HORSESHOES UP MY SOMETHING.

AT THE POSSUM LAKE BOAT RAMP,

310
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:58,896
WHICH IS FINE,
BUT THE WORST THING IS

311
00:14:58,896 --> 00:15:02,132
THEY ACTUALLY HAVE AN
ATTENDANT TO ACTUALLY
MAKE SURE YOU PAY.

312

HE'S NOT ALL THAT BUSY

314

NOW, WE'RE THERE,
AND WE HAVE BOATS,

315
00:15:14,011 --> 00:15:17,848
BUT WE'RE WAITING
FOR A CERTAIN TIME...

316
00:15:19,783 --> 00:15:22,586
USUALLY AROUND NOW

317
00:15:22,586 --> 00:15:24,788
WOULD BE LUNCHTIME.

318
00:15:24,788 --> 00:15:28,125
AND THIS IS A MAN
WHO DOESN'T SKIP MEALS.

319
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,561
SO WE FIGURE AS SOON
AS HE CLEARS THE AREA,

320
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:34,398

TO GET OUR BOATS LAUNCHED.

THE FUN BEGINS.

NOW, I GOT THE V-8,

323
00:15:38,368 --> 00:15:41,171
SO I'M THE FIRST ONE
DOWN THERE WITH THE
POSSUM VAN.

324
00:15:41,171 --> 00:15:43,907
WALTER STUCK HIS BOAT ON TOP
OF HIS CAR POINTING DOWN

325
00:15:43,907 --> 00:15:47,711
SO HE CAN HARDLY
SEE WHERE HE'S GOING.

326
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,246
AND I STARTED DOWN THERE,

327
00:15:49,246 --> 00:15:51,315
BUT SOMETIMES
WHEN YOU'RE IN A HURRY,

328
00:15:51,315 --> 00:15:52,883
YOU KNOW,
YOU GET A LITTLE --

329
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:54,918
WALTER'S A
BIT LOST THERE,

330
00:15:54,918 --> 00:15:57,854
AND BILL JUST STUCK
THE CANOE ON TOP THERE.

331
00:15:57,854 --> 00:15:59,323
SO I'M TRYIN' --
NO, NO, NO.

332
00:15:59,323 --> 00:16:00,791
ONE MORE TIME.
NO, NO, BACK.

333

NO, CUT HER RIGHT.

334

335

AH!

336
00:16:05,162 --> 00:16:07,331
THAT'S A LITTLE
FRUSTRATING.

337
00:16:07,331 --> 00:16:10,133
AND, AGAIN, BILL
IS WORKING HIS WAY THROUGH.

338
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:12,936
SHE GETS TURNED SIDEWAYS
AND, UH --

339
00:16:12,936 --> 00:16:17,207
WELL, YOU CAN
SEE WHAT'S COMIN' HERE.

340
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:19,343
SO NOW BILL PULLS UP
IN FRONT OF ME.

341
00:16:19,343 --> 00:16:21,478
HE'S UPSET BECAUSE I'M
TAKIN' UP THE WHOLE RAMP,

342
00:16:21,478 --> 00:16:23,180
AND HE'S SAYIN' HE WANTS
TO LAUNCH HIS CANOE.

343
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,050
TO WHICH I SAY,
WHAT CANOE?

344
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,754
AND YOU REALISE THAT HE'S
UP THE CREEK WITHOUT A CANOE,

345
00:16:30,754 --> 00:16:32,322
ACTUALLY AT THIS POINT.

346
00:16:32,322 --> 00:16:33,924
SO HE GOES BACK
TO GET HIS CANOE ON THERE.

347
00:16:33,924 --> 00:16:37,527
MEANWHILE, WALTER'S HAVIN'
PROBLEMS, UH, WITH VISIBILITY,

348
00:16:37,527 --> 00:16:39,563
SO HE FIGURES WHAT HE SHOULD
PROBABLY IS BACK UP

349
00:16:39,563 --> 00:16:40,831
AND USE THE SIDE MIRROR.

350
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:42,733
HE'S GOT A
CLEAR VIEW THERE.

351
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:45,302
AND YOU KNOW, IN THEORY,
IT'S NOT A BAD PLAN.

352
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:47,671
BUT IN PRACTICE...
NOT SO GOOD.

353
00:16:48,872 --> 00:16:50,941
SO NOW HE'S LOST HIS MIRROR,
SO HE PULLS AHEAD

354
00:16:50,941 --> 00:16:52,609
TO PICK UP THE MIRROR,

355
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:57,147
NOT REALISING BILL IS DRIVING
AROUND IN THE SAME AREA.

356
00:16:59,382 --> 00:17:02,986
AND NOW OF COURSE BILL HAS
DUCT TAPED THE CANOE
RIGHT ON THERE

357
00:17:02,986 --> 00:17:05,956
AND HE THROWS THE ANCHOR
INSIDE UP AT THE BOW END.

358
00:17:05,956 --> 00:17:08,225
AND HE'S OKAY.
HE'S GOOD TO GO.

359
00:17:08,225 --> 00:17:10,660
SO HE TAKES OFF
WITH THAT UNIT.

360
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:14,064
AND MEANWHILE, WALTER IS
DRIVING ALL OVER
THE PLACE TOO,

361
00:17:14,064 --> 00:17:16,133
AND SO AM I, TRYING TO
GET MY BOAT LAUNCHED.

TO FIRE THE ANCHOR OUT

AROUND A TREE,
