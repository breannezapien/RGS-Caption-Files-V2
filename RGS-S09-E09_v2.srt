AT IT HERE.

158
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,738
YEAH, YOU MIGHT
AS WELL.

159
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,373
WOULDN'T HURT
TO CHECK IT OUT.

160
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:16,241
I WISH I'D DONE THAT WITH
THE FRONT SUSPENSION

161
00:06:16,308 --> 00:06:18,811
WHEN I SET THE
LAND SPEED RECORD.

162
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:22,848
800 MILES AN HOUR,
STRADDLING A 747 ENGINE,

163
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:25,184
STRAPPED TO
A GROCERY CART.

164
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:27,819
LUCKILY I WAS IN
THE CHILD SEAT,

165
00:06:27,886 --> 00:06:30,856
SO I WAS FACING
BACKWARDS WHEN SHE
WENT OFF THE TRACK.

166
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:33,225
YOU KNOW HOW GROCERY CARTS
ALWAYS HAVE THAT
ONE SHAKY WHEEL?

167
00:06:34,426 --> 00:06:35,427
HERE'S THE PROBLEM.

168
00:06:35,494 --> 00:06:36,662
YOU'VE GOT A
BLOWN FUSE HERE.

169
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:38,230
I THINK I'VE GOT
ONE OF THESE.

170
00:06:38,263 --> 00:06:40,132
I WONDER HOW THAT
COULD'VE HAPPENED?

171
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,868
I WAS RUNNING IT ON
NORMAL HOUSE POWER.

172
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,003
I BUILT MY OWN
THERMONUCLEAR GENERATOR,

173
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:48,373
BUT I'M NOT GONNA START IT UP
UNTIL I'M SURE I DON'T
WANT A FAMILY.

174
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,010
WELL, IT MIGHT'VE
BEEN A BAD FUSE.

175
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,612
MAYBE YOU'VE GOT A
SPIKE IN THE LINE,
OR SOMETHING.

176
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:54,813
THERE WE GO.
THERE WE GO.

177
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,814
GIVE THAT A TRY.
SAY SOMETHING.

178
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:56,882
SAY SOMETHING.

179
00:06:56,915 --> 00:06:58,083
WHAT DO YOU WANT
ME TO SAY?

180
00:06:58,116 --> 00:06:59,451
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
I NEVER KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

181
00:06:59,484 --> 00:07:02,054
RIGHT AFTER THE WAR,
EISENHOWER WANTED ME
TO MEET CHURCHILL.

182
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:03,555
I'M FIGURING,
OH, BOY --

183
00:07:09,494 --> 00:07:11,830
YOU KNOW ONE THING THAT'S
GOTTEN REAL POPULAR OVER
THE LAST FEW YEARS

184
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:13,332
IS GARDENING.

185
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:14,733
I DON'T MEAN THE ORDINARY
KIND OF GARDENING,

186
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,002
WHERE YOU GROW CARROTS
AND TOMATOES

187
00:07:17,035 --> 00:07:18,503
AND BARLEY AND HOPS.

188
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,205
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE FANCY GARDENS.

189
00:07:20,238 --> 00:07:21,506
YOU KNOW, WITH THE
EXOTIC PLANTS IN THEM,

190
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:24,376
THE WATERFALL AND THE SOUND
AND LIGHTS AND EVERYTHING.

191
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:25,510
SO TODAY I'M GOING
TO SHOW YOU

192
00:07:25,577 --> 00:07:27,279
HOW TO MAKE A CHEAP YET
IMPRESSIVE CENTREPIECE

193
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,214
FOR YOUR GARDEN.

194
00:07:29,247 --> 00:07:32,217
NOW, I KNOW YOU COULD JUST
WIRE SPEAKERS AND LIGHTS
ALL OVER YOUR YARD,

195
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,552
BUT THEN THE NEXT
THING YOU KNOW,

196
00:07:33,618 --> 00:07:34,920
YOU'VE ELECTROCUTED
A GROUNDHOG,

197
00:07:34,953 --> 00:07:36,888
AND THE GREENPEACERS
ARE ALL --

198
00:07:36,955 --> 00:07:38,657
SO WE'RE GONNA GO
ANOTHER WAY.

199
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,859
WE'RE GONNA USE
WIND POWER.

200
00:07:40,926 --> 00:07:43,595
ALL'S YOU NEED IS
AN OLD BIKE

201
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,065
AND A SET OF DRUMS.

202
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:53,004
YOU CAN GET A FULL SET OF
DRUMS PRETTY CHEAP.

203
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:55,440
ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS
HANG AROUND A MUSIC STORE,

204
00:07:55,507 --> 00:07:59,945
UNTIL SOME PARENT COMES IN
AND BUYS A SET OF DRUMS
FOR THEIR KID.

205
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:02,647
JUST GET THEIR ADDRESS,
WAIT ABOUT A MONTH,

206
00:08:02,714 --> 00:08:04,049
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO BUY
THE WHOLE SET BACK

207
00:08:04,115 --> 00:08:05,917
FOR ABOUT TEN CENTS
ON THE DOLLAR.

208
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:08,353
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
THE FIRST STEP IS

209
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,689
YOU WANNA TURN THE BIKE
INTO A WINDMILL STAND.

210
00:08:10,755 --> 00:08:12,257
YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH ON
YOUR OWN THERE.

211
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:14,893
I DON'T BELIEVE
THERE'S A MANUAL FOR
THAT PARTICULAR CONVERSION.

212
00:08:17,295 --> 00:08:18,630
OKAY, STEP TWO NOW.

213
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:21,466
I JUST GOTTA MOUNT THE BASE DRUM
ONTO THE WINDMILL STAND.

214
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:23,902
I'VE ALREADY ATTACHED THE
UNIT TO THE BICYCLE WHEEL,

215
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:25,704
USING THE HANDYMAN'S
SECRET WEAPON,

216
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:26,805
DUCT TAPE.

217
00:08:26,872 --> 00:08:28,306
BUT I WANT YOU TO
NOTICE SOMETHING HERE.

218
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,709
I'VE HAD TO REMOVE THE STRUTS
ON THIS ON THIS SIDE
OF THE BICYCLE,

219
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:32,944
WHICH MEANS I'VE WEAKENED THE
STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY

220
00:08:33,011 --> 00:08:34,813
OF THE BIKE ITSELF,

221
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,215
SO I HAVE TO
COMPENSATE FOR THAT

222
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:40,485
BY REALLY HORSING DOWN
THE AXLE TO THE OTHER SIDE.

223
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:43,388
[ GRUNTING ]

224
00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:46,057
OKAY, WE'RE JUST
ABOUT DONE HERE.

225
00:08:46,124 --> 00:08:47,692
I'VE, UH, ADDED
A COUPLE OF DRUM STICKS.

226
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,061
THEY'RE ACTUALLY HINGED TO
THE RIM OF THE DRUM.

227
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:51,496
SO AS SHE GOES ROUND,

228
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:53,865
THEY'RE GONNA HIT THE
FLOOR TOM AND THEN THE SNARE,

229
00:08:53,898 --> 00:08:56,234
AND THEN ON THE TOP SIDE,
THEY SLAM UP AGAINST
THE BASE DRUM.

230
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:57,702
SO I GET A DOWN BEAT
ON THE BASE DRUM,

231
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:59,070
I GET MY BACK BEAT
ON THE SNARE,

232
00:08:59,137 --> 00:09:00,972
I GET A FUNKY RIFF
HAPPENING ON THE FLOOR TOM,

233
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,707
ALL AGAINST A STEADY RIDE
ON THE CYMBALS.

234
00:09:02,774 --> 00:09:04,409
THIS IS NOT JUST
A GARDEN ORNAMENT,

235
00:09:04,442 --> 00:09:06,578
THIS IS A HAPPENING.

236
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:08,613
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

237
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,249
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

238
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:13,251
NOW ALL WE GOTTA DO
IS WAIT FOR THE WIND.

239

[ DRUM SOLO PLAYING ]

240
00:09:32,904 --> 00:09:35,907
I WANNA TALK TO YOU MIDDLE-AGED
DO-IT-YOURSELFERS OUT THERE.

241
00:09:35,974 --> 00:09:38,977
I KNOW YOU'RE THE KIND OF GUY
THAT, WHEN SOMETHING BREAKS,

242
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,513
YOU THINK IT'S YOUR RIGHT
AND YOUR DUTY

243
00:09:41,546 --> 00:09:43,715
TO TRY TO FIX IT.

244
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:45,416
EVEN IF IT DOESN'T BREAK,

245
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,286
SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO JUST
TAKE SOMETHING APART TO
SEE HOW IT WORKS

246
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:50,221
BEFORE YOU'LL USE IT.

247
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:54,359
AND A LOT OF TIMES,
WHEN YOU TAKE IT APART
TO SEE HOW IT WORKS,

248
00:09:54,425 --> 00:09:56,361
IT DOESN'T.

249
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:00,331
OKAY, I KNOW THIS IS A
KEY PART OF YOUR BEHAVIOR,

250
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:02,433
IT MIGHT EVEN BE
HOW YOU DEFINE YOURSELF,

251
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:04,302
BUT I'M TELLIN' YOU,
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS

252
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:06,971
THAT YOU JUST SHOULDN'T
FOOL AROUND WITH...

253

BE HARD TO HEAR FROM ME,

257
00:10:20,785 --> 00:10:22,120
BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU,

258
00:10:22,186 --> 00:10:24,122
THERE ARE CERTAIN TIMES
YOU JUST GOTTA SAY,

259
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:26,758
I CAN'T FIX THIS, OKAY?

260
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,893
DON'T SAY IT
OUT LOUD.

261
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,729
JUST PUT ALL THE PARTS
OF THE VCR OR THE COMPUTER

BACK TO WHERE THEY WERE --
OR AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN GET 'EM.

263
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:36,868
THEN WHAT YOU SAY
REAL LOUD IS,

264
00:10:36,901 --> 00:10:39,604

A BAD DESIGN.

THE PULSE REGULATOR.

MAYBE IT'S TIME
YOU BECAME AN ADULT.

457
00:18:52,695 --> 00:18:55,865
AND TO DO THAT, YOU GOTTA STOP
BLAMIN' YOUR PARENTS

458
00:18:55,932 --> 00:18:58,401
AND PUT THE BLAME WHERE IT
REALLY BELONGS...

REALLY SUCKS.

LIKE, SAY YOU PILFER A LITTLE
MONEY FROM YOUR PARENTS.

462

THEY MIGHT GROUND
YOU FOR A FEW NIGHTS
IN YOUR LITTLE HOME, RIGHT?

00:19:11,014 --> 00:19:12,816
WELL, YOU PILFER SOME
MONEY FROM A BANK,

464
00:19:12,882 --> 00:19:15,752
AND THEY'LL GROUND YOU FOR A
FEW YEARS IN THEIR BIG HOUSE!

465
00:19:17,287 --> 00:19:18,755
OR SAY YOU'RE FED UP
WITH YOUR PARENTS

466
00:19:18,822 --> 00:19:21,457
BECAUSE THEY WON'T LET YOU
BORROW THEIR ONLY CAR.

467
00:19:21,524 --> 00:19:23,760
GENERAL MOTORS HAS
MILLIONS OF CARS,

468
00:19:23,793 --> 00:19:26,362
AND THEY GET REALLY UPSET
IF YOU BORROW THEIR'S!

469
00:19:28,765 --> 00:19:30,466
AND TALK ABOUT
YOUR PARENTS' RULES.

470

HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
THE PENAL CODE?

472
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:38,141
SO I'D STICK WITH
MY PARENTS, IF I WERE YOU.

473
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,276
SURE THEY'RE TOUGH,
BUT AT LEAST WITH
YOUR PARENTS,

474
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:43,513
YOU'RE ELIGIBLE FOR
PAROLE WHEN YOU'RE 18.

BE SOMETHING TO THAT.
