IT WOULD BE LESS...

FUN?

101
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,503
IT'S FUN AND MACHO
AND MASCULINE AND MANLY

102
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,005
BECAUSE IT'S...

103
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,673
MADE IN
AMERICA.

105
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,812
WELL, OK, UH,
BUT THE ENGINE IS...

00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,748
FULLY SUPERCHARGED.

107
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:44,284
ALMOST OUT OF TIME HERE,
HAROLD.

108
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,752
OH, OK, ALL RIGHT,

109
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:48,655
REMEMBER THAT TIME,
REMEMBER THAT TIME,

110
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,990
YOU WERE PEELING OUT DOWNTOWN,

111
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,959
THE STREETS WERE ON FIRE.

112
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,961
YOUR RADIO WAS CRANKED UP.

113
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,963
THAT'S BECAUSE IT WAS...

114
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,531
MY
BIRTHDAY.

115
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,066
[laughing]

116
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,636
THIS IS EDGAR MONTROSE
SAYING THAT

117
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:07,607
IF YOU'RE CLOSE ENOUGH
TO HEAR THE DYNAMITE HISSING,

118
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,343
YOU'RE TOO DARN CLOSE.

119
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:14,480
OH, THE SUN
HAS TURNED GREEN 

120
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,816
THE TREES ARE
UPSIDE DOWN 

121
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,651
EVERYTHING IS SHAKING 

122
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:21,321
WHILE EXPLOSIONS
CONTINUALLY POUND 

123
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,523
YOU COWER
IN YOUR BEDROLL 

124
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,658
AFRAID
YOU'RE GOING TO DIE 

125
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,795
BUT IT ISN'T
THE END OF THE WORLD 

126
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:31,497
IT'S JUST A REALLY
IMPRESSIVE HANGOVER 

127
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:33,333
[laughing]

128
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:37,337
NOW THAT WE'VE GOT GARBAGE
BUILDING UP AROUND THE LODGE

129
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,706
FASTER THAN
IT USULY BUILDS UP,

130
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:43,409
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE
YOUR OWN GARBAGE COMPACTER

131
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,445
USING THE LAW OF THE LEVER,

132
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,681
WHICH ISN'T "IF YOU
DON'T LOVE HER, LEAVE HER,"

133
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,750
OR IN STINKY PETERSON'S CASE,

134
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,952
"IF YOU DO LOVE HER,
LEAVE HER."

135
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,821
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.

136
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,957
A LEVER IS KIND OF LIKE
THE MAIL SERVICE.

137
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,960
YOU'VE GOT YOUR FIRST,
SECOND AND THIRD CLASS.

138
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,463
SOMETIMES
IT DOESN'T GET THERE AT ALL.

139
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:07,300
NOW THIS HERE,
THIS IS YOUR FIRST CLASS.

140
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:11,304
AND THEN WHEN YOU SET HER UP
LIKE THIS,

141
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,805
LIKE THAT,

142
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,640
THAT'S YOUR SECOND CLASS.

143
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,242
AND THIS, I BELIEVE,

144
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,378
IS A THIRD CLASS LEVER.

145
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,882
AND THIS IS A FOURTH CLASS
TWO-BY-FOUR.

146
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,818
I THINK I'LL LEAVE HER.

147
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,988
I'M GOING TO USE THIS LADDER
AS A LEVER

148
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,990
IN MY GARBAGE COMPACTER.

149
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,825
TO MAKE THAT WORK,

150
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,229
I HAVE TO CUT A SLOT
IN THE SIDE OF THIS OIL DRUM

151
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:39,866
FOR THE LADDER TO FIT INTO
AND COMPRESS THE GARBAGE.

152
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:43,503
TO DO THAT,
ALL I NEED IS A HACKSAW.

153
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,486
YOU MIGHT WANT TO HAVE
THIS SIDE OF THE DRUM

154
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,555
FACING AWAY FROM THE STREET,

155
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,957
'CAUSE IT'S NOT
THAT ATTRACTIVE.

156
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,393
NOW YOU LOAD YOUR GARBAGE
IN THERE.

157
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,662
MAKE YOURSELF A REAL HIGH STACK

158
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,532
BECAUSE YOU'LL COMPRESS THIS
DOWN SO THIN

159
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,968
IT WILL SLIDE UNDER
YOUR NEIGHBOUR'S FRONT DOOR.

160
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:19,806
NOW YOU TAKE YOUR LADDER AND
STICK IT ON TOP OF THE PILE,

161
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:23,276
AND LINE IT UP SO THE LADDER
WILL GO INTO THE SLOT.

162
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:26,813
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
APPLY SOME DOWNWARD PRESSURE.

163
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,054
HMM?

164
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,059
HAROLD,
IS MOOSE THOMPSON AROUND?

165
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:44,997
ALL RIGHT, I'LL USE
THE NEXT BEST THING.

166
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,801
[van door opening]

167
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,369
[engine starting]

168
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,757
THERE'S YOUR GARBAGE
COMPRESSED TO A SIZE

169
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,893
THAT WILL FILL YOU WITH PRIDE.

170
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,129
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

171
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,632
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

172
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,101
OK, MAYBE I DIDN'T
QUITE COMPRESS IT.

173
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,770
I MORE OR LESS
DROVE IT INTO THE GROUND.

174
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:28,908
THIS IS WHERE WE HAVE TO REVERT
BACK TO THE LAW OF THE LEVER.

175
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,910
IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE...

176
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,980
LEAVE 'ER.

177
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,648
BUZZ LOST HIS PLANE.

178
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,550
I KNOW WHERE TO LOOK.

179
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,757
YOU GUYS ARE TRYING TO LOOK
20 AGAIN.

180
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:49,028
I'M ASKING AS A FRIEND:
STOP DOING THAT, ALL RIGHT?

181
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,564
YOU'RE WEARING
THE SNAPPY CLOTHES,

182
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,566
YOU'RE EXERCISING,
YOU'RE DIETING,

183
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,402
MAYBE GETTING YOURSELF
A $10 HAIRCUT.

184
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,904
[laughing]

185
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,405
HERE'S A BULLETIN.

186
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,907
IT'S NOT WORKING.

187
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,408
STOP DOING THAT.

188
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,911
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

189
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,913
YOU'VE GOT A CAREER.

190
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,048
YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE MONEY.

191
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,551
YOU KNOW HOW TO TALK TO WOMEN.

192
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,419
YOU'RE A MAN OF THE WORLD.

193
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,922
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT'S TAKEN 25 YEARS,

194
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,424
A WIFE AND THREE KIDS
TO GET THERE.

195
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,927
BE HONEST ABOUT
HOW OLD YOU ARE.

196
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,428
YOU'LL ACCEPT IT.

197
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,130
STOP LOOKING IN MIRRORS

198
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:26,933
AND BUY PANTS WITH
ELASTIC WAISTBANDS.

199
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,001
IF THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU HAPPY,

200
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,104
LOOK AT A PICTURE OF YOURSELF
WHEN YOU WERE 20.

201
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:35,441
LOOK AT THE HAIR, THE SHIRT,
THE PANTS, THE SHOES.

202
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,044
YOU WANT TO LOOK
LIKE THAT AGAIN?

203
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,545
I DIDN'T THINK SO?

204
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:43,015
REMEMBER, WE'RE ALL
IN THIS TOGETHER.

205
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,221
HI, I'M EDGAR MONTROSE.

206
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:51,424
I'M AN EXPERT IN EXPLOSIVES.

207
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,826
THE ONLY WAY TO BECOME
AN EXPERT

208
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:58,531
IS THROUGH YEARS OF EXPERIENCE
AND CONSTANT EXPERIMENTATION.

209
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,135
LET'S SEE,
FIVE STICKS OF DYNAMITE

210
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,805
KEPT IT IN THE AIR
FOR 60 SECONDS.

211
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:08,040
LET'S TRY SIX.

212
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,981
I'VE PULLED OFF A BEAUTY
THIS TIME.

213
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,482
COME ON, HAROLD.

214
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,652
NOW, THE STUFF WAS NOT SELLING,
GRANTED.

215
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,288
THE GARBAGE MEN
REFUSED TO TAKE IT.

216
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,925
WAIT TILL THEY SEE
WHAT I THROW OUT FOR THEM

217
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,426
DURING CARP SEASON.

218
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:30,496
THEN I CALLED
THE WASTE MANAGEMENT PEOPLE.

219
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,666
THEY WANTED TO CHARGE ME
TO TAKE THIS AWAY.

220
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,935
BUT I PULLED OFF A MAJOR COUP.

221
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:39,438
HE'S AGREED TO LET THEM USE
10 ACRES OF LODGE PROPERTY

222
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:40,940
AS A LANDFILL SITE.

223
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,609
WE'VE GOT TO SORT THROUGH
THE GARBAGE,

224
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,144
PUT IT IN CONTAINERS.

225
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,646
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

226
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,348
IF THE LAVA LAMP IS
ANIMAL OR MINERAL.

227
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,550
BUT IT'S FREE, HAROLD.

228
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:55,855
WE GET RID OF THIS STUFF
AND IT DOESN'T COST US A CENT.

229
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,923
YOU CAN'T CALL IT
A LANDFILL.

230
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,627
YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT CERTIFIED,
APPROVED, ZONED.

231
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,496
IT'S ALL DONE, HAROLD.

232
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,464
THEN 10 ACRES OUT BACK,

233
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:08,467
THAT'S BEEN ZONED
A PUBLIC LANDFILL.

234
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:09,969
PUBLIC?

235
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,537
PUBLIC MEANS THAT

236
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,273
ANYBODY CAN PUT STUFF THERE.

237
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,808
I DON'T THINK SO.

238
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,843
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YES!

239
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,713
PUBLIC LANDFILL,
JUST LIKE PUBLIC BEACH.

240
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,915
THAT MEANS ANYBODY CAN USE IT.

241
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,450
WELL THEN, GREAT.

242
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:28,320
THAT MEANS WE'LL GET PEOPLE
COMING TO THE LODGE.

243
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:31,123
YOUR GENERATION JUST
DOESN'T GET IT, DO THEY?

244
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,160
NOPE --
SO FAR SO GOOD.

245
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,265
WHEN IT COMES TO SAFETY,

246
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:42,935
NO ONE IS MORE FAMILIAR
WITH THE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS

247
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,438
THAN MY PAL...
BUZZ SHERWOOD.

248
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:47,940
MAN, IS NOTHING SACRED
ANY MORE?

249
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,842
NO, I DON'T THINK SO, BUZZ.

250
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,510
WHERE IS YOUR AIRPLANE?

251
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,146
SOMEBODY RIPPED IT OFF, MAN.

252
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,116
THEY VIOLATED MY DOCK,
MY SPACE.

253
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,218
TOOK MY ONE TRUE LOVE.

254
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:04,290
FIRST JERRY GARCIA,
NOW THIS.

255
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,192
THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY.

256
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,627
IF THEY FLEW OFF
IN YOUR PLANE,

257
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,464
THEY PROBABLY LEFT
A TRAIL OF PARTS.

258
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,965
YEAH.

259
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,467
SO EVENTUALLY...

260
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:19,205
EVENTUALLY, IF HE FLIES IT
LONG ENOUGH,

261
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:22,241
WE'LL GET THE WHOLE PLANE BACK!

262
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,743
[laughing]

263
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,745
THAT WOULD BE GREAT!

264
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,246
THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

265
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,181
HERE'S A LESSON FOR YOU.

266
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,417
SAFETY ALSO MEANS SECURITY.

267
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,919
YEAH, SAFETY, SECURITY,
THEY'RE LIKE THAT.

268
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,421
IT'S THE '90's.

269
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,823
IT'S THE '90's,
SO WATCH YOUR STUFF.

270
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,658
IT'S NOT THE '60's ANY MORE

271
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,361
WHERE WE LIVED IN
PEACE AND BROTHERHOOD.

272
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,864
THE BIG MAN
THAT RAN THE GOVERNMENT,

273
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,332
HE DIDN'T LIKE THAT.

274
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:49,235
SO THEY'VE TURNED US
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

275
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:52,938
THEY'VE GOT THE POLICE,
AND THAT'S THE POWER, MAN.

276
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,440
WE'RE JUST DROIDS.

277
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:55,941
BUZZ, BUZZ!

278
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,443
WHAT, MAN?

279
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,945
I THINK I FOUND THE PLANE.

280
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:01,947
MY PLANE!

281
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,550
OH, WOW, LOOK HOW CLEAN IT IS!

282
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:09,355
YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT PLUGGING
THE HOLES IN THE PONTOONS.

283
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:11,023
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

284
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,960
AND MAYBE STOP FLYING
THROUGH THE RIFLE RANGE.

285
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:17,396
OH YEAH, OK, YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.

286
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,532
YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

287
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,302
BOY, OH BOY,
THIS LODGE CLEAN-OUT

288
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,205
IS WORKING BETTER THAN
ANYBODY EXPECTED.

289
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:29,542
WE'RE FINDING STUFF
WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN YEARS.

290
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:33,512
INCOME TAX FORMS, GUM,
OLD MAN SEDGWICK'S FALSE TEETH.

291
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,915
ACTUALLY,
THEY WERE WITH THE GUM.

292
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,417
THE LODGE SEEMS BIGGER NOW.

293
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,919
I KNOW IT'S NOT.

294
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,387
IT'S THE SAME SIZE.

295
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:45,591
BUT IT FEELS BIGGER 'CAUSE
THE STUFF IS GONE, SO BIGGER.

296
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,594
BUT IT SEEMS DIFFERENT,
LIKE, SPATIALLY.

297
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,429
YOU FEEL THE VOLUME?

298
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,131
THERE'S VOLUME IN THE ROOM.

299
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,732
THE SAME, YET DIFFERENT.

300
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,434
IT'S BIGGER, BUT SMALLER.

301
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,703
WITHOUT BEING SMALLER,
IT'S LARGER.

302
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,439
THAT'S THE WAY I FEEL --
THAT'S ME.

303
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:04,443
YOUR TAX DOLLARS ARE PAYING
FOR THAT EDUCATION, FOLKS.

304
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,013
THE WASTE DISPOSAL COMPANY
DUMPED EVERYTHING IN FRONT

305
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,950
'CAUSE THEY THOUGHT THE LODGE
WAS THE DUMP.

306
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,018
THERE WAS A LOT OF GOOD STUFF.

307
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:17,223
I GOT THESE SLIM WHITMAN ALBUMS,
A TOASTER THAT ALMOST WORKS,

308
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,959
AND THERE MUST HAVE BEEN
50 EGG CARTONS.

309
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,162
I GOT A GUMBY AND POKEY --
ONE LEG MISSING.

310
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,798
BY THE TIME WE TOOK
THE GOOD STUFF,

311
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,401
THERE WASN'T ENOUGH LEFT
TO FILL A WHEELBARROW.

312
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,403
ANOTHER TRUCK'S PULLING UP!

313
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,072
WE GOT TO MAKE SURE

314
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:36,408
THEY'RE NOT THROWING OUT
ANY GOOD JUNK.

315
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:39,411
IF THERE'S ANY POWER RANGERS,
CALL ME!

316
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:40,980
GO, GO!

317
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:43,916
OH, HEY, MAN!

318
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,417
I'M BUZZ SHERWOOD.

319
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,253
IF YOU GET TO BE A PILOT,

320
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:50,522
YOU CAN USE LANDMARKS
LIKE ROADS AND HIGHWAYS

321
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:51,991
TO STEER YOUR PLANE.

322
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,827
BUT REMEMBER,
STAY IN THE PASSING LANE.

323
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,730
OTHERWISE THE MOTORISTS
YELL AT YOU.

324
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,231
[laughing]

325
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,301
FOR ALL YOU HANDYMEN
WHO USE PAINTSPRAY CANS,

326
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,169
THERE'S AN ARROW ON THE TOP

327
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,339
THAT TELLS YOU WHICH WAY
THE PAINT WILL SPRAY.

328
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,775
I WOULD ADVISE
THAT YOU LOOK AT THAT

329
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,610
BEFORE YOU START SPRAYING.

330
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:14,580
THAT'S MY SUGGESTION ANYWAY.

331
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:17,383
MEANWHILE BACK AT
THE FRISBEE FARM --

332
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:18,951
OH, THANK YOU, BILL.

333
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,487
BILL WAS FIRING THAT FRISBEE
AROUND.

334
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,455
HE KNOCKED THE HUBCAP OFF.

335
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,724
PUT THE HUBCAP
BACK ON THE VAN.

336
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,226
NO, THE HUBCAP.

337
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,727
PUT THAT ON THE...

338
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,229
THAT'S THE...

339
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,730
OH, I SEE.

340
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,232
ALL RIGHT, OK.

341
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,900
WELL, THAT'S...

342
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,402
I'M HERE, BILL.

343
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,404
NO, BILL, I'M HERE.

344
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,905
AH, ALL RIGHT.

345
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,408
WELL, YOU KNOW,
YOU GO OUT THERE

346
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:43,909
FOR THE EXERCISE.

347
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,577
A LITTLE AFTERNOON SPORT.

348
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,079
HERE YOU GO, BILL.

349
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,580
HERE WE GO.

350
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,082
HEY, NICE GRAB.

351
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,583
THROW HER BACK.

352
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,485
CHUCK IT IN HERE, BABY.

353
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:58,524
YOU HEAR ABOUT THE VIOLENCE
OF THE SPORT,

354
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,193
BUT, TO ME,
IT'S WITH GOOD REASON.

355
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,932
YOU HAD IT COMING,
ALL RIGHT?

356
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,934
OK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?

357
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:10,436
THAT'S MY HUBCAP.

358
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:11,937
THAT WAS MY HUBCAP.

359
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,605
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

360
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,441
OH, THE GARBAGE CAN LID.

361
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:16,942
OH, ALL RIGHT.

362
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,444
OH MAN, THIS GUY.

363
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,612
OK, THROW IT IN HERE, BILL.

364
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,047
NO, IT'S UP AND...

365
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,549
OH MAN, OH DEAR.

366
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,551
IT'S A BOOMERANG-TYPE THING.

367
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,052
THERE YOU GO.

368
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,887
WHAT GOES AROUND
COMES AROUND, EH?

369
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,889
PUT THAT BACK ON THERE.

370
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,891
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

371
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,393
WHAT IS IT?

372
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,395
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT, BILL?

373
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:37,997
WHAT THE HECK?

374
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:44,269
OH, IT'S ONE OF THOSE LITTLE,
WHAT DO THEY CALL THEM?

375
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,871
THE CONTACT LENS.

376
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,406
HA-HA!

377
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,908
IT'S A LITTLE FRISBEE TO BILL.

378
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,910
HE FIRES THAT IN THERE.

379
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:53,412
LET HER RIP.

380
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,980
LET HER GO.

381
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,716
BOY, THAT IS HARD TO SEE,
COMING THROUGH THE SUN.

382
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,351
AND... I GOT HER!

383
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:00,853
ALL RIGHT.

384
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,354
TRY THAT, BILL.

385
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:03,922
THERE YOU GO.

386
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,924
TOP THAT ONE IF YOU CAN.

387
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:07,926
OH MY GOSH, HE DID.

388
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,428
OH HO HO, BY GOLLY.

389
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:12,164
HE CAUGHT THAT
WITHOUT HIS GLASSES ON.

390
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,433
OH, I DON'T WANT TO
WATCH THAT.

391
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,935
OH, DO THAT IN YOUR OWN HOME.

392
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,437
GEE.

393
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:19,938
WHAT'S THAT?

394
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,340
THAT'S A SAW BLADE.

395
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,543
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
THROWING A SAW BLADE.

396
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,045
BILL, BILL.

397
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,379
OH, BO-BO-BO-BO!

398
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,881
OH!

399
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:30,382
WHAT WAS THAT?

400
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:31,884
LOOK AT THAT.

401
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,352
MY HAT.

402
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,887
I GOT OFF LUCKY.

403
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:38,290
A FLYING SAUCER THE KIDS USE
IN THE WINTER.

404
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,492
YOU CAN USE THEM
IN THE SUMMER.

405
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,694
OH, SORRY, BILL --
LOOK OUT!

406
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,863
IT'S GARBAGE DAY!

407
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,832
[laughing]

408
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,134
BYE.

409
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:52,971
STAY TUNED --
EDGAR'S AT THE END OF HIS FUSE.

410
00:17:56,975 --> 00:18:00,312
THIS GARBAGE CLEAN-OUT
IS WORKING OUT GREAT.

411
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,548
WE'VE SALVAGED SO MUCH STUFF.

412
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:06,485
I'M SURE WE'LL GET AROUND TO
FINDING A USE FOR IT.

413
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,421
I HAVEN'T HAD THIS MUCH FUN
SINCE MY DAD

414
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:12,858
WORE HIS RUDE T-SHIRT
TO PARENT-TEACHER NIGHT.

415
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,061
THERE'S BEEN 30 LOADS
DUMPED OUT FRONT,

416
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:19,698
BUT STILL THE LANDFILL SITE
IS ALMOST EMPTY.

417
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,200
REGULAR RECYCLING PLANTS,

418
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:25,370
THEY TAKE GLASS,
METAL AND PAPER, THAT'S IT.

419
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,072
WE TAKE EVERYTHING.

420
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:30,042
THIS IS GOING TO MAKE
A COOL LAMP.

421
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,846
THE GUYS STAND IN THE LANEWAY
WAITING FOR THE NEXT LOAD.

422
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,981
MOST OF THE STUFF THEY PICK OFF

423
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,217
BEFORE THEY GET IT
OFF THE TRUCK.

424
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,352
MOOSE THOMPSON
MADE A GREENHOUSE

425
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:41,753
OUT OF TOILET SEATS.

426
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,523
WHEN THE SUN SHINES,
HE FLIPS THEM ALL UP.

427
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,793
BUSTER HADFIELD MADE
A COUCH OUT OF ORANGE RINDS.

428
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,395
IT'S AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE
OF RECYCLING,

429
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,398
AND HE'LL NEVER HAVE TO BUY
ANOTHER AIR FRESHENER.

430
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,068
WE'RE THINKING OF EXPANDING
THE LANDFILL

431
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,270
TO INCLUDE
ALL OF LODGE PROPERTY.

432
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:01,840
THAT WAY WE CAN TAKE GARBAGE
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.

433
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,810
YOU'VE GOT TO THINK
INTERNATIONALLY.

434
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,913
POSSUM LODGE, HEAD OFFICE
TO THE WORLD'S GARBAGE.

435
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,581
THAT'S AN EXCITING VISION.

436
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,083
OH YEAH, YEAH.

437
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,419
MORE EXCITING IF
I DIDN'T HAVE A NOSE.

438
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,989
WELL, THAT CAN BE ARRANGED,
HAROLD.

439
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,595
[Explosion]

440
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,430
THIS IS EDGAR MONTROSE.

441
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,167
DID YOU KNOW THAT
FAST-BURNING FUSE

442
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,103
LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE
SLOW-BURNING FUSE?

443
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,671
I DIDN'T.

444
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,742
GARTH HARBLE HERE,
ANIMAL CONTROL,

445
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:39,778
WITH ANOTHER TIP
THAT COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE,

446
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,446
OR EVEN YOUR CARPETING.

447
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,448
COME ON IN HERE, RED.

448
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,450
LAUNDRY DAY, GARTH?

449
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,952
NO, RED.

450
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,954
BADGER DAY.

451
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,455
[Mewing]

452
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,624
OH, OH, EASY THERE, FELLA.

453
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,793
YOU GOT A BADGER IN THERE?

454
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,797
EITHER THAT, RED, OR
A VERY UNDERDONE HAMBURGER.

455
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:02,568
[laughing]

456
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,069
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

457
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:07,773
YOU KNOW, RED, BADGERS ARE
THE PUNKS OF THE FOREST.

458
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,008
OH, PURE TROUBLE,
PURE TROUBLE.

459
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:12,477
IF YOU GET A BADGER
IN YOUR HOUSE,

460
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,913
SAY GOODBYE
TO ANYTHING OF VALUE,

461
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,417
UNLESS YOU CAN TRAP HIM
IN A SACK LIKE THIS.

462
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,919
THEY JUST FREEZE UP
IN THE DARK.

463
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,421
[Mewing]

464
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:25,557
I THINK THAT FELLA MAY BE
THAWING OUT A BIT.

465
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,893
HOW DID YOU GET HIM
INTO THE BAG?

466
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,763
I HEARD AN ANIMAL CRASHING
AROUND IN THE BASEMENT.

467
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,300
I FIGURED THAT'S EITHER
A COUGAR OR A BADGER.

468
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:38,070
COUGARS DON'T COME DOWN
FROM THE HILLS,

469
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:39,905
SO IT HAD TO BE A BADGER.

470
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,541
I HUNG A SACK
ON THE BASEMENT DOOR.

471
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:46,245
WITHIN A COUPLE OF SECONDS
I HAD MYSELF A BADGER.

472
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,447
HE'S DOCILE AS A KITTEN NOW.

473
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:49,948
OH!

474
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,618
GARTH, THERE'S BEEN SOME RUMOURS

475
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:56,455
THAT COUGARS HAVE BEEN
COMING DOWN FROM THE HILLS

476
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:57,956
AND KILLING COWS.

477
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,125
NO, COUGARS DON'T DO THAT.

478
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,561
WELL, I THINK MAYBE THEY DO.

479
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:06,398
UNLESS...
UNLESS THEY'RE RABID.

480
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,400
OK, OK.

481
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:09,901
OH BOY.

482
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,404
ANOTHER SUPER DAY.

483
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,406
OH, OH.

484
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:15,974
OHHH!

485
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:19,478
[Red]: IT DOESN'T GET
ANY BETTER THAN THIS.

486
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,914
I DON'T THINK THEY CAN SEE YOU,
UNCLE RED.

487
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:24,416
SORRY.

488
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:29,421
WE'VE DECIDED TO KEEP THE CRAP
AND GET RID OF THE INSURANCE.

489
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,257
TURNS OUT IT WAS
A $200 DEDUCTIBLE ANYWAY.

490
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:33,859
WE DON'T GET TO COLLECT

491
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:36,461
EVEN IF THE LODGE
BURNS TO THE GROUND.

492
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,597
WE'LL GET ANYBODY WHO COMES HERE

493
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,832
TO SIGN
A PERSONAL DAMAGES WAIVER.

494
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:44,436
I THINK IT'S UNDER THE BOX
OF FLAVOUR STRAWS, HAROLD.

495
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:45,937
OK.

496
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:47,539
I'LL GET IT LATER.

497
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:52,244
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW LANDFILL
SITES CAN BE FILLING UP.

498
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,946
WE CAN'T KEEP
OUR TINY ONE FULL.

499
00:21:55,013 --> 00:22:00,452
IT'S AMAZING WHAT PEOPLE
THROW AWAY.

500
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,387
ACETYLENE TANKS,
AIR CONDITIONERS,

501
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:03,889
HIGH-VOLTAGE TRANSFORMERS.

502
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:06,892
I GUESS ONE MAN'S GARBAGE
IS ANOTHER MAN'S

503
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,393
POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS
EXPLOSION.

504
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,897
THEY SAY YOU CAN JUDGE
CIVILIZATI BY ITS GARBAGE.

505
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:14,299
I WONDER WHAT
FUTURE ARCHAEOLOGISTS

506
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:16,568
WILL SAY ABOUT
OUR CIVILIZATION.

507
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:21,106
THEY'LL SAY IT WAS A BIG ONE.

508
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,908
AND IT SMELLED CHEESY.

509
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:24,409
[squealing]

510
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,411
MEETING TIME, UNCLE RED.

511
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:28,213
YOU GO AHEAD, HAROLD.

512
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,584
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,
I'LL BE HOME AFTER THE MEETING.

513
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,187
I'VE PICKED UP
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

514
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:37,456
THE STAINS ON THIS LAMPSHADE

515
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,625
GO PERFECTLY WITH
OUR LIVING ROOM WALLS.

516
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,994
CHEAPER THAN A COAT OF PAINT.

517
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,731
TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

518
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:49,768
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF, HAROLD,
AND THE GANG AT POSSUM LODGE,

519
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,270
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

520
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:54,606
[applause]

521
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:56,108
[possum squeal]

522
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:57,843
[Harold]: RISE.

523
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:05,384
[All]: QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

524
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,687
[Harold]: WE'RE HAVING
A BEER BOTTLE PLEDGE.

525
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:14,693


526
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,795


527
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,697


528
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,031


529
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:22,868


530
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,736


531
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:32,477
