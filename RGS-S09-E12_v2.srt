1
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:03,770
OH.
YOU SEE THIS?

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,438
SOMETHIN' UNDER
THE WINDSHIELD WIPER HERE.

3
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:10,410
YOU SHOULD NEVER READ ANY
PAPER YOU FIND UNDER YOUR
WINDSHIELD WIPER.

4
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:14,581
SEE, THAT WAS A WASTE OF TIME.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE READ THAT.

5
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:17,517
AND I SHOULDN'T BE EXPECTED
TO HAVE TO READ THINGS
UNDER MY WIPER

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,587
JUST BECAUSE SOCIETY THINKS IT'S
A GREAT PLACE TO STICK STUFF.

7
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:22,155
SO LOOK WHAT I'VE DONE HERE.

8
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,591
I GOT A PAIR OF HEDGE CLIPPERS
AND TOOK 'EM APART.

9
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:26,526
ON THE BOTTOM OF THE
WINDSHIELD I STUCK ONE BLADE,

10
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:28,161
SHARP SIDE UP.

11
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,230
THE OTHER BLADE I PUT RIGHT
ON THE WIPER ITSELF,

12
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:32,365
SHARP SIDE DOWN.

13
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:35,335
NOW I'M ALL SET FOR ANY KIND
OF ADVERTISING FLYER

14
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:38,571
OR SAVE THE WHALES PAMPHLET
OR PARKING INFRACTION

15
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:41,741
THAT HAPPENS TO FIND ITS
WAY ONTO MY WINDSHIELD.

16
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,444
I DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT IT;
I DON'T HAVE TO READ IT;

17
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:47,047
I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TOUCH IT
TO GET RID OF IT.

18
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:50,016
I JUST DISPOSE OF IT BY
CLEANING MY WINDSHIELD
THE NORMAL WAY.

19
00:00:55,822 --> 00:01:00,794
[cheering and applause]

20
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,969
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

21
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:11,004
APPRECIATE IT.

22
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:12,572
WELL, WE'VE HAD A MAJOR
WIMPING OUT

23
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,407
UP AT THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

24
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:15,742
EVERY YEAR AT THIS TIME,

25
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:17,310
WE CHALLENGE THE GUYS AT
CARIBOU LODGE

26
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:18,812
TO A BIG TUG OF WAR.

27
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:20,113
BUT THEY BACKED OUT.

28
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:21,948
THEY SAID THERE'S TOO MUCH OF
A HEALTH RISK.

29
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,716
BECAUSE AFTER LAST YEAR'S
TUG OF WAR,

30
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:27,954
IT ENDED UP IN A DRAW AFTER
FIVE HOURS OF STRAINING
ON BOTH SIDES.

31
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:31,558
THE ONLY REAL WINNER WAS
THE LOCAL HERNIA CLINIC.

32
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:33,393
SO NOW WE MISSED THE
THRILL OF COMPETITION

33
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,795
AND THE FUN OF BEATING THE CRAP
OUT OF ANOTHER LODGE.

34
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,000
WELL, DALTON,

35
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,570
I SEE YOU FINALLY GOT
THAT SUIT BACK FROM
THE CLEANERS.

36
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:47,307
I GOT A GREAT IDEA HOW TO
REPLACE THE TUG OF WAR
WITH CARIBOU LODGE.

37
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:50,176
YOU'RE GOING TO PERFORM
THE NUTCRACKER? 

38
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,413
NO, NO, RED.
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THOSE
GROUPS THAT RECREATE BATTLES?

39
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,747
OH, YEAH.
NO, NO.

40
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,917
WE DON'T NEED TO RECREATE --
THE WORLD HAS ENOUGH
FRESH BATTLES.

41
00:01:57,984 --> 00:01:59,052
NO, THESE ARE
HISTORIC BATTLES, RED.

42
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,221
THEY REENACT HISTORIC BATTLES.

43
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,389
WELL, SURE, BUT THERE'S
BEEN NO HISTORIC BATTLE
AROUND HERE,

44
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:07,594
OTHER THAN THAT TIME JUNIOR
SINGLETON'S WIFE FOUND OUT
HE BOUGHT A HOVERCRAFT.

45
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:09,462
NO, SEE, WE'RE GONNA
MAKE UP OUR OWN BATTLE.

46
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,432
AS LONG AS IT'S THE CARIBOU
LODGE VERSUS US, WHO CARES?

47
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:13,800
WE GET TO WEAR
THE NEAT CLOTHES.

48
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:16,202
WE GET TO SHOOT
THE MUSKETS.

49
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,638
DO WE GET TO BE SHOT
AND KILLED OURSELVES?

50
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:21,107
'CAUSE THAT WOULD KINDA TAKE
THE FUN OUT OF IT FOR ME.

51
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,609
NO, NO, NO.
HERE LET ME SHOW YOU.

52
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:23,943
HERE HOLD THIS.

53
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,912
OKAY, NOW, SEE,
WHAT WE'RE SHOOTING --

54
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,214
OOP --

55
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,416
ARE THESE
LITTLE FLAGS, RED.
OH, ALL RIGHT.

56
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,718
SEE, WE SHOOT
THE RED FLAGS,

57
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,486
THEY SHOOT THE
GREEN FLAGS.

58
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,890
PUT A LITTLE PIECE OF DUCT TAPE
ON HERE SO IT'LL STICK TO A
GUY WHEN HE GETS HIT.

59
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,459
DUCT TAPE, THE MUSKETEER'S
SECRET WEAPON.

60
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,262
OH, BOY.
OKAY.

61
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,164
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KIND OF WON ME
OVER WITH THAT PART,

62
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,033
BUT, BOY, I REALLY DON'T
WANNA WEAR THE COSTUME.

63
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,935
MAYBE I COULD BE AN
UNDERCOVER MUSKETEER.

64
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,904
NO, RED, YOU CAN'T!
WHAT?

65
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,140
NO, YOU GOTTA WEAR THE
COSTUME, OR IT'LL WRECK IT.

66
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,109
OH, ALL RIGHT,
I'LL WEAR THE COSTUME.

67
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:57,510
BUT I'M NOT
WEARING THE TIGHTS.

68
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:58,578
AH, YOU GOTTA WEAR THE

69
00:02:58,611 --> 00:02:59,979
TIGHTS, OR IT'LL --
I'LL WEAR THE TIGHTS!

70
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,381
MAN.

71
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,284
[applause]

72
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,891
IT'S TIME FOR THE
POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

73
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,694
[cheering and applause]

74
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,401
AND TODAY'S PRIZE --

75
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:24,504
WELL, LET ME JUST SAY,
YOU'RE GONNA NEED THIS
WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

76
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:25,738
ARIZONA!

77
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,073
NOPE.

78
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:30,643
TWO FREE LINE DANCING LESSONS AT
THE MERCURY CREEK DANCE ACADEMY.

79
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:33,179
UH, Mr GREEN,
YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS

80
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,348
TO GET Mr ROTHSCHILD
TO SAY THIS WORD...

81
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,420
YEAH, ALL RIGHT, MIKE.

82
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:41,888
AND GO!

83
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,457
OKAY, WINSTON, YOUR JOB
DOESN'T PAY ENOUGH, SO YOU --

84
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,492
WORK HARD FOR A RAISE.

85
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,961
NO, SEE,
YOU'RE WAY OFF.

86
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,262
YOU HATE THIS JOB, OKAY.

87
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,964
THINK ABOUT IT,
AND WHEN YOU DO THINK ABOUT IT,

88
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,333
YOU'D RATHER BE DOING
ANYTHING ELSE, SO YOU --

89
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,934
STOP THINKING
ABOUT IT SO MUCH!

90
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,136
JUST DO IT TO IT, YOU KNOW.
SUCK IT UP.

91
00:03:57,203 --> 00:04:00,173
THAT'S WHAT WE DO IN THE
SEWAGE BUSINESS ANYWAY.

92
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,642
WELL, I'M SAYING THIS JOB
IS DRIVING YOU CRAZY.

93
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,777
YOU'RE GETTING ALL
DEPRESSED, SO YOU --

94
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,679
SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP.

95
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,148
GET A CHECK-UP
FROM THE NECK UP.

96
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:12,051
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN NEED TO GO
SEE A DOCTOR IF YOU DO THIS.

97
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,921
OH, GET ANTHONY ANTHONY'S
NEW TAPE.

98
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:17,590
YEAH, IT GIVES YOU
THE MOTIVATIONAL
BOOST YOU NEED

99
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:20,159
TO GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE
IF YOU'RE FEELING DOWN.

100
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,996
IF YOUR LIFE STINKS,
DON'T INHALE.

101
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,933
YOU'RE ALMOST OUTTA
TIME, Mr GREEN.

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,735
THIS WORD ISN'T IN
YOUR VOCABULARY.

103
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,336
I GIVE UP.

104
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,405
WHAT?
THAT'S A TERRIBLE ATTITUDE!

105
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,007
YOU CAN'T JUST QUIT NOW.

106
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,675
THERE YOU GO.

107
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,887
HEY, HAROLD.
OH, HEY, UNCLE RED.

108
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,690
NOW, DON'T TAKE
THIS THE WRONG WAY,

109
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:53,359
BUT HOW CAN YOU
STAND IT HERE?

110
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,228
I LOVE
WORKING HERE.

111
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,696
IT'S VIBRANT.
IT'S EXCITING.

112
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,031
IT'S CHALLENGING.

113
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:59,999
IT'S SEXY.

114
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,302
SEE WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND, HAROLD?

115
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,604
WELL, AS A
MATTER OF FACT,

116
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,539
SEE THAT BLONDE
OVER THERE?

117
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,241
WHERE?
THERE.

118
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:10,143
WHERE?
OVER THERE!

119
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,878
WELL, I CAN'T SEE
WHERE YOU'RE POINTING.

120
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,046
WHAT'S HER NAME?

121
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,013
CYNTHIA.

122
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,815
HEY, CYNTHIA!

123
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,151
JUST HI,
THAT'S ALL.

124
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:21,487
SHE'S KINDA CUTE.
YOU ASKED HER OUT YET?

125
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:25,091
IN MY MIND.

126
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,393
YOU WANNA KNOW
WHAT YOU GOTTA DO?

127
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:30,196
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE
ME ADVICE ON DATING?

128
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,398
COME ON, NOW, HAROLD,
I WAS QUITE THE LADIES' MAN

129
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,800
BEFORE I MET YOUR
AUNT BERNICE YOU KNOW.

130
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,401
AND LOOK AT US NOW, HUH?

131
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:38,438
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER A
LONG, LONG, LONG TIME.

132
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,707
LONG, LONG...

133
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,012
UNCLE RED.

134
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,413
RIGHT, OKAY,

135
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,615
SO YOU GOTTA GET A
GIFT FOR CYNTHIA, OKAY?

136
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,617
SOMETHING SPECIAL
JUST FOR HER.

137
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:55,988
UM, MAYBE ELECTRIC SOCKS
OR A PERSONAL FLOATATION DEVICE.

138
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,757
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

139
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,192
THEN YOU GOTTA ASK
HER OUT ON A DATE.

140
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:00,727
BUT KEEP IT SUBTLE, ALL RIGHT?

141
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,196
YOU WANNA LEAVE SOMETHING
OF YOURS ON HER DESK.

142
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,664
NOTHING TOO
OBVIOUS, RIGHT.

143
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,667
MAYBE A PAIR OF BOOTS
OR A BUCKET, EH?

144
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,002
THAT'S JUST AN EXCUSE
SO YOU CAN TALK TO HER.

145
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,638
THEN YOU JUST
KEEP IT COOL.

146
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,041
YOU SAY,
HEY, CYNTHIA!

147
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,310
PASS ME THAT BUCKET,
WILL YOU?

148
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,811
AND LET'S GO OUT.

149
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,213
SEE?

150
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,949
UNCLE RED, UM, I GOTTA
GET BACK TO WORK NOW.

151
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,350
RIGHT.
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

152
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,319
OKAY, I'LL SEE
YOU LATER, HAROLD.

153
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,587
BY, CYNTHIA!

154
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,867
Red:
IT SEEMS NO MATTER
HOW MUCH PLANNING YOU DO

155
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,835
OR HOW SAFETY CONSCIOUS YOU ARE,

156
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,737
SOMETHING ALWAYS GOES WRONG.

157
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,939
I HAD THIS FISHING BOAT MOUNTED
ON TOP OF MY CAR THERE,

158
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,508
AND SHE WAS SOLID.

159
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,743
I HAD PUT A ROLL AND A HALF
OF DUCT TAPE INTO THE JOB.

160
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,712
SO I'M DRIVING ALONG,
AND UP COMES THE WIND.

161
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,647
BAM! SHE'S OUTTA THERE.

162
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,048
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

163
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,384
I DIDN'T ACTUALLY AIM THE
BOAT AT THAT HITCHHIKER.

164
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,819
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

165
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,188
YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD
THE STRING OF OBSCENITIES.

166
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,589
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
A WOMAN OF THAT AGE

167
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,892
SHOULDN'T BE HITCHHIKING
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

168
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:09,896
BUT I'M THINKING THIS WHOLE
ROOF RACK CONCEPT NEEDS A
BIT OF REENGINEERING.

169
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,932
WOULDN'T IT BE A LOT SAFER
AND MORE AERODYNAMIC

170
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,001
IF YOU COULD PUT STUFF
UNDER THE CAR

171
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,969
INSTEAD OF OVER IT?

172
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,372
BUT AS THE FAT GUY SAID
TO THE PHONE BOOTH,

173
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,274
WE NEED A LITTLE MORE CLEARANCE.

174
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:26,412
[groaning]

175
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,216
ALL RIGHT THE NEXT
STEP'S REAL EASY.

176
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,952
WHAT YOU NEED IS FOUR OF THESE
GREAT BIG TRACTOR TIRES.

177
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,420
THEY'RE NOT THAT
HARD TO COME BY.

178
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,823
THERE'S ABANDONED TRACTORS
ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY,

179
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,858
THANKS TO THE
GOVERNMENT TRADE POLICIES

180
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:42,695
AND PEOPLE PREFERRING
TO EAT FOOD MADE FROM VINYL.

181
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,330
[groaning]

182
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,467
OKAY, WE HAVE A CHALLENGE HERE.

183
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,537
THE TRACTOR WHEEL ISN'T ACTUALLY
MADE TO MOUNT RIGHT ONTO
THE CAR HUB.

184
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,172
I GOT THE RIM OFF.
TOOK THE TIRE OFF THAT.

185
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,241
THE RIM FITS FINE.
I DON'T WANT THE RIM ON THERE.

186
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,310
I WANT THE TRACTOR
WHEEL ON THERE.

187
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:00,279
SO WHAT I NEED TO DO IS MOUNT
THE TRACTOR WHEEL ONTO THE RIM

188
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,615
WITH SOME KIND OF AN ADAPTOR.

189
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,450
NOW, IF YOU CALL UP
YOUR LOCAL AUTO SUPPLY

190
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:08,387
AND TELL 'EM YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR AN ADAPTOR TO PUT TRACTOR
WHEELS ONTO A 1990 HONDA,

191
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,556
WELL, THERE'S GONNA
BE SOME LAUGHTER,

192
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,860
PROBABLY A VISIT FROM THE COPS,
MAYBE A PSYCHIATRIC NURSE.

193
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,028
SO INSTEAD,
MIGHT I RECOMMEND

194
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,164
THE HANDYMAN'S SECRET ADAPTOR,

195
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,866
DUCT TAPE.

196
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,569
STARTING TO THE
IDEA NOW, AREN'T YOU?

197
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:26,506
NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO IS SLIDE
THE BOAT UNDERNEATH THERE,

198
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,875
AND I'LL BE ABLE TO CARRY IT
SAFELY AND EASILY

199
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,444
TO MY PREDETERMINED DESTINATION.

200
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,279
IT'S NOT A TRACTOR-TRAILER.

201
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,882
IT'S A TRACTOR
AND A TRAILER.

202
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,851
AND IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE.

203
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,953
SO REMEMBER IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

204
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,855
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

205
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,123
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

206
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,658
THERE'S ANOTHER BONUS
TO THIS UNIT.

207
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,661
I'VE ACTUALLY ADDED PADDLES TO
THE DRIVE WHEELS ON HER.

208
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,030
SO IT'S NOT JUST
A BOAT CARRIER,

209
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,366
IT'S AN AMPHIBIOUS CAR.

210
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:15,121
THERE'S ONE QUESTION THAT
TERRIFIES ALL MEN,

211
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:19,859
EVEN MORE THAN "CAN I
HELP YOU FIND THE LINGERIE
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, SIR?"

212
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,628
YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE A GUY WHO'S
LIVED WITH A WOMAN FOR ANY
LENGTH OF TIME,

213
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,665
SHE'S EVENTUALLY GONNA ASK
YOU THAT TERRIBLE QUESTION,

214
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:28,200
"DO I LOOK OLD?"

215
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,871
NOW, I KNOW SHE'S TOLD YOU
SHE ALWAYS WANTS YOU TO BE
HONEST WITH HER,

216
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:34,707
BUT SHE WASN'T BEING HONEST
WITH YOU WHEN SHE SAID THAT.

217
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:37,877
OKAY, SO YOU COULD PRETEND
YOU DIDN'T HEAR HER,

218
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,012
BUT SHE'LL ASK AGAIN,
BELIEVE ME.

219
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,548
OR YOU COULD JUST
LAUGH IT OFF, YOU KNOW.

220
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,318
BUT I SAY KEEP THAT LAUGH TO
EXACTLY THREE SECONDS.

221
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:48,621
A THREE-SECOND LAUGH MEANS,
NO, YOU DON'T LOOK OLD.

222
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:51,824
A TEN-SECOND LAUGH SAYS,
CAN YOU SAY METHUSELAH?

223
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:57,730
AND A 30-SECOND LAUGH IS
TECHNICALLY A SUICIDE
ATTEMPT ON YOUR PART.

224
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:02,134
NOW, THE BEST ANSWER HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE QUESTION

225
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,870
BECAUSE THE QUESTION HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE QUESTION.

226
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,572
SHE KNOWS SHE LOOKS OLD.

227
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,975
AND SHE KNOWS YOU KNOW
SHE LOOKS OLD.

228
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,777
WHAT SHE'S CONCERNED ABOUT IS
THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE UNHAPPY

229
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,412
BECAUSE SHE LOOKS OLD.

230
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,214
SO WHEN SHE SAYS,
"DO I LOOK OLD?"

231
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,583
GIVE HER AN ANSWER
THAT PUTS HER MIND AT EASE.

232
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,152
SAY, "YOU LOOK PERFECT
TO ME, HONEY."

233
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,254
OR, "NOT THROUGH THESE EYES."

234
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,223
RATHER THAN,
"DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

235
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:25,591
"I NEVER LOOK AT YOU."

236
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,830
UNLESS YOU WANNA BE OUT THERE
BUYING LINGERIE AGAIN.

237
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,531
REMEMBER I'M PULLIN' FOR YOU.

238
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,066
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

239
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,144
[audience whistling]

240
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,947
[applause]

241
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,690
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THIS.

242
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:59,058
BOY, YOU LOOK GREAT.

243
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,826
I GAVE YOU THE
FANCIEST UNIFORM.

244
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,061
I FEEL LIKE A MORON.

245
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,930
SEE, GETTIN' USED
TO IT ALREADY.

246
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,033
DOESN'T HELP.
WHAT'S THIS THING FOR?

247
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,567
WELL, THAT'S YOUR
BATON, RED.

248
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,037
YOU'RE THE COMMANDER.
THAT'S HOW YOU LEAD THE TROOPS!

249
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,140
WELL, SOME TROOPS.
SO FAR, YOU, MIKE, AND I ARE
THE ONLY GUYS WITH COSTUMES.

250
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,808
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

251
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,611
WELL, THERE'S A BIT
OF RESISTANCE TO MY
COSTUME RENTAL FEE.

252
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,012
BUT IT'LL WORK OUT, YOU KNOW.

253
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,447
ONCE THOSE GUYS
HEAR THE BATTLE CRY,

254
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,083
THEY'LL BE SCRAMBLING
FOR THEIR LEOTARDS.

255
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,218
THERE'S A VISUAL.

256
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:33,459
[whistling and applause]

257
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,263
I DELIVERED ALL THE FLAGS
TO THE CARIBOU LODGE.

258
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:38,631
I WAS SUPPOSED TO GIVE
THEM THE GREEN ONES,

259
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,132
AND THEN WE SHOOT OFF
THE RED ONES, RIGHT?

260
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,167
THAT'S RIGHT.

261
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,234
WHAT ABOUT THE
GUYS AT THE LODGE?

262
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:43,569
DID THEY HAVE
THEIR UNIFORMS ON?

263
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:46,172
YEAH, THEY'RE A
BUNCH OF CLOWNS.

264
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,407
WHAT DO THEIR
COSTUMES LOOK LIKE?

265
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:52,144
THEY'RE A
BUNCH OF CLOWNS.

266
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,746
THEY DIDN'T LIKE
Mr HUMPHREY'S PRICES,

267
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,749
SO THEY MADE A DEAL WITH
THE CIRCUS THAT'S IN TOWN.

268
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,851
WAIT A SECOND, DOESN'T
THE CIRCUS NEED THEM?

269
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,454
NO, THEY SHUT DOWN.
OH.

270
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,056
YEAH, THE ELEPHANT HAD A
GASTRO-INTESTINAL PROBLEM.

271
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,792
THEY HAD TO HOSE DOWN THE
FIRST FOUR ROWS OF SEATS.

272
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,563
THERE'S A BIG
STINK ABOUT THAT.

273
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,333
WELL, LET'S GET
THIS OVER WITH.

274
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,603
YES, LET'S FIGHT THOSE
CLOWNS ON THE BEACHES!

275
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,705
FIGHT THEM IN
THE MARKETPLACE!

276
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:20,406
WE WON'T REST UNTIL WE --

277
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,308
DALTON, DALTON.

278
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,577
I'M THE COMMANDER,
NOT YOU.

279
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,913
OH.
SORRY.

280
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,917
OKAY.

281
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,253
WE'RE GONNA FIGHT
ON THE WEEKEND.

282
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,490
AND, UH, WE'LL FIGHT
ON A CIVIC HOLIDAY,
IF WE HAVE TO.

283
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,760
THAT'LL BE DOUBLE TIME,
OF COURSE.

284
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:43,863
ALL RIGHT, NO,
DALTON, YOU GO AHEAD.

285
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,499
I'M KINDA OUTTA
THE MOOD NOW, RED.

286
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:49,769
LET'S GO KICK
SOME CARIBOU BT!

287
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,871
YEAH-H-H-H!

288
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,083
YEAH-H-H-H!

289
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:07,953
WELCOME TO
TALKING ANIMALS.

290
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,755
ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER, ED FRID,

291
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,057
HAS BROUGHT US IN
SOMETHING SPECIAL TODAY,

292
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,226
ABOUT A
GAZILLION BEES.

293
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:16,996
COME ON
UP HERE, ED.

294
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,198
NO, NO,
COME ON.

295
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,201
IT'S JUST THAT I THOUGHT
I SAW ONE GET OUT.

296
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,270
I GUESS WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

297
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,739
IS IT A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE AN
ACTIVE BEEHIVE INDOORS?

298
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,374
I MEAN, IS THIS SAFE?

299
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,309
NO, NOT REALLY.

300
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,845
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
HAVE PROTECTIVE WEAR ON.

301
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,780
YEAH, DEFINITELY.

302
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:39,084
BUT MY SAFETY SUIT'S GETTING
A LITTLE SNUG, RIGHT.

303
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,486
SO INSTEAD,
WHAT I DID

304
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,556
WAS I TOOK THIS INSECT NET,
AND I COVERED OVER
THE ENTIRE --

305
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:44,957
THE, UH --
HIVE. HIVE.

306
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,091
HIVE, YES.

307
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,359
OH, OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

308
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:48,527
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S TOO BAD

309
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,396
'CAUSE I WAS HOPING YOU COULD
STICK YOUR HAND IN THERE

310
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:54,633
AND GRAB A CHUNK OF HONEYCOMB
AND SHOW IT TO EVERYBODY.

311
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,636
YEAH, I THOUGHT YOU
MIGHT WANT THAT, YOU KNOW.

312
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,471
THEY ALWAYS WANNA
SEE THE HONEYCOMB.

313
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:01,874
I GUESS IT'S WORTH IT,
ME GETTING STUNG TO DEATH!

314
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,476
I'M KIDDIN'
YOU, RED.

315
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,544
I'LL GET YOU
HONEYCOMB.

316
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,246
THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT
THIS SMOKER.

317
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,581
KNOCKS THE BEES
RIGHT OUT.

318
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,316
ALL RIGHT.

319
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:11,984
GONNA NEED A LITTLE MORE SMOKE
THAN THAT, AREN'T YOU, ED?

320
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,152
YEAH, YOU WANT ME
TO MAKE 'EM MAD?

321
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,387
IS THAT YOUR
HELPFUL SUGGESTION?

322
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,223
OH, ONE GOT OUT!

323
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,224
WATCH OUT.

324
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,162
WHERE'D SHE GO?
THERE ON THE TABLE.

325
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,830
OKAY, RED,
HOLD THIS.

326
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,432
I DON'T SMOKE.

327
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,069
THIS IS NOT A GOOD
TIME FOR HUMOUR, RED.

328
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,139
WHOA!

329
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,775
AH-H-H-H!

330
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,149
OKAY, I GOTTA GO.

331
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,389
Red:
YOUNG WALTER AND I ARE 
GONNA PUT A NEW DOCK IN. 

332
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:54,426
WE'RE GONNA USE THE OIL DRUMS 
FOR FLOATATION UNDER THE DOCK
 

333
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:55,928
AND WE HAD ALREADY BUILT IT. 

334
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,963
WE JUST HAD TO KINDA POSITION 
THEM IN THE RIGHT DISTANCE -- 

335
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,531
PUT THAT RIGHT 
UNDER THERE, WALTER -- 

336
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,200
RIGHT DISTANCE APART. 

337
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:02,468
AND THE DOCK WE JUST -- 

338
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:03,903
HEAVY, IT'S A HEAVY UNIT. 

339
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:08,040
THAT DOCK, THE WATER WAS -- 
THE WOOD WAS PRETTY WELL --
 

340
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,074
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'. 

341
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,843
SO WE GOT THAT ON THERE AND - 

342
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,378
OH-OH, LOOK OUT. 
LOOK OUT. 

343
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:13,646
OH, OH! 

344
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,250
OH, BOY. 
OH, BOY.
 
OH, BOY.

345
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,386
OH! 

346
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,821
YOU KNOW, I DON'T REALLY 
REMEMBER THIS PART. 

347
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:28,327
I'M SURE WALTER DID 
EVERYTHING HE COULD FOR ME.
 

348
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,230
ANYWAY, WE GOT HER UP, 
AND THE IDEA WAS WE WERE
 
JUST GONNA ROLL HER RIGHT IN.

349
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,732
WE DIDN'T WANNA 
GET INTO THE LAKE. 

350
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,467
NOT REALLY SURE WHAT -- 

351
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,536
BUT THE DRUMS KINDA 
BUNCHED UP ON US THERE,
 

352
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:40,272
AND WALTER ENDED UP ON THE -- 

353
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,041
NOW, DON'T -- 
WHY WOULD YOU GO UP THERE? 

354
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,542
THAT'S NOT HELPING TO GO UP - 

355
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,444
WALTER, THAT'S REALLY 
OF NO USE.
 

356
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,012
THAT'S OF NO USE. 

357
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,948
THAT'S OF NO VALUE 
TO UP THE POLE. 

358
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,116
YOU'RE NOT A FLAG, WALTER. 

359
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,153
WE NEED TO GET THE DOCK 
INTO THE WATER.  

360
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:55,521
HE DOESN'T WANNA -- 

361
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:56,755
IT'S POSSUM LAKE. 
HE DOESN'T WANNA --
 

362
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:57,890
OKAY, TELL YOU WHAT. 
HERE YOU GO. 

363
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:58,924
I'LL GET HER LEVEL. 
JUST JUMP DOWN.
 

364
00:15:58,958 --> 00:15:59,858
JUST JUMP DOWN. 

365
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:00,759
NOT TOO HARD! 
NOT TOO HARD!
 

366
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,928
OH-H-H-H! 

367
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,897
OH, MAN.  

368
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,366
WALTER'S NOT REALLY 
MUCH OF A SWIMMER.
 
 

369
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,501
I DIDN'T HAVE A LIFE RING 
OR A LIFE JACKET.
 

370
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:12,404
NEED TO THROW HIM SOMETHING 
THAT WOULD FLOAT.
 

371
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,306
UH, OH, HERE WE GO. 

372
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,178
INCOMING! 

373
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,381
OH, I KNOW. 

374
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,483
GIVE HIM SOMETHING 
HE CAN KINDA STEER HIMSELF.  

375
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:25,684
GET HIMSELF BACK TO SHORE. 

376
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:29,121
HERE YOU GO. 
PADDLE. 

377
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:32,624
I BETTER GO OUT AND RESCUE HI 
LIKE THE COAST GUARD WOULD.
 

378
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:35,361
ACTUALLY THIS GAVE ME -- 
I GOT OUT THERE ON THE BARRELS
 

379
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,129
AND I GOT AN IDEA. 

380
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,630
COME ON IN. 
COME ON IN.
 
 

381
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,733
HERE'S WHAT WE'LL DO. 
HERE'S WHAT WE'LL DO.
 

382
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,136
OKAY, SEE THAT TRUCK? 
THAT'S OUR NEW DOCK!
 
 

383
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,646
MOST PEOPLE DON'T REMEMBER
RODERICK FEATHERSTONE,

384
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,682
AND EVERYBODY ELSE
IS WORKING ON IT.

385
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,952
HE WAS THIS AREA'S GIFT
TO THE SILENT SCREEN.

386
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,520
BUT WHEN THE BRIGHT
LIGHTS OF HOLLYWOOD

387
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,922
TURNED THEIR BACK ON HIM
AND SHOWED HIM THE DOOR,

388
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:06,392
HE RETURNED BACK TO
SPEND OUT HIS LIFE

389
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,627
HERE AT POSSUM LAKE.

390
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:12,865
BORN WEB SWITZER,
APRIL 1, 1900,

391
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:14,633
HE WAS A NATURAL
THEATRICAL TYPE,

392
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,803
SO HE WAS FORCED TO LEAVE
TOWN AT THE AGE OF 19.

393
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,739
HE WENT TO HOLLYWOOD,
WHERE HE GOT SORT OF FAMOUS

394
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:24,910
AS AN ACTOR UNDER THE NAME
RODERICK FEATHERSTONE.

395
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:28,847
NOBODY EVER MENTIONED RODERICK
BY THE TIME I HIT IT BIG
IN HOLLYWOOD.

396
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,316
HE ALWAYS PLAYED
THE HERO'S BEST FRIEND.

397
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,886
HE MADE A WHOLE STRING
OF PRETTY BAD FILMS...

398
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,521
"VIOLET'S TENDER CONDITION,"

399
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,722
"MUSTARD KEENE,"

400
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,924
"KNEE FLAPPERS,"
AND "DON'T TELL MOMMA!"

401
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:40,893
BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL HE
DID A SOUND FILM

402
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,362
THAT PEOPLE REALIZED
HE WASN'T PRETENDING.

403
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,230
HE REALLY COULDN'T ACT.

404
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,199
HIS LAST FILM
LAID A BIG TIME EGG.

405
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,902
CAME OUT IN 1930,
A MUSICAL CALLED

406
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,104
"WHAT DEPRESSION?"

407
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,242
AFTER A FEW YEARS,
RODERICK WAS TENDING CHICKENS

408
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,812
BACK ON THE FAMILY FARM
NEAR POSSUM LAKE.

409
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,180
ACCORDING TO MOST PEOPLE,

410
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,649
HE WAS HAVING A LOT OF TROUBLE
ADJUSTING BACK TO OUR LIFESTYLE.

411
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:10,355
NOW, I DON'T RECALL HE CAME
INTO MY STORE VERY MUCH.

412
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,257
HE'D SEEN HOW
THE OTHER HALF LIVED,

413
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,193
AND HE STILL CARRIED
HIMSELF THAT WAY.

414
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,028
YOU KNOW THE KIND.

415
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,398
GUY WANTED TO BUY
STUFF THAT WORKED.

416
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,900
HE RAN THAT
AMATEUR THEATRE COMPANY,

417
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,571
AND HE WAS ALWAYS AFTER ME FOR
YEARS TO PLAY WILLY LOMAN

418
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:29,741
IN A PLAY CALLED
"DEATH OF A SALESMAN."

419
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,677
AS IF ANYONE WAS
GONNA COME SEE A PLAY

420
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,512
WHEN THE TITLE GAVE
AWAY THE ENDING.

421
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,950
I REMEMBER ON
HIS 80th BIRTHDAY

422
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,651
THEY GOT TOGETHER A BUNCH
OF HIS OLD FRIENDS,

423
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:42,221
AND THEY HAD THIS BIG TO-DO FOR
HIM AT THE OLD FILM HOUSE.

424
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,957
I WAS WORKING THERE AT THE TIME
AS A FREELANCE USHER.

425
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,092
SO WE HELPED Mr FEATHERSTONE
TO HIS SEAT

426
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,596
AND THEY STARTED SHOWING ALL
THESE JERKY BLACK AND WHITE
OLD FILMS, RIGHT.

427
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:54,299
BUT THAT FILM BROKE,
AND TOOK 'EM A LONG
TIME TO FIX IT,

428
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:58,103
SO Mr FEATHERSTONE, HE GOT UP
AND MADE THIS LITTLE SPEECH

429
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,507
ABOUT WHAT A GREAT LIFE HE'D
HAD BEING A MOVIE STAR
AND EVERYTHING,

430
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:04,409
BUT THAT POSSUM LAKE WAS HOME,

431
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,812
AND HOME'S THE
MOST IMPORTANT THING.

432
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:11,183
AND EVERYBODY WAS CRYING AND
CLAPPING AND EVERYTHING.

433
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:15,521
AND I REALIZED THAT THIS WAS MY
CHANCE TO EMPTY THE TILL.

434
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:18,924
AND THEN HE WAS GONE.

435
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,460
HE NEVER MARRIED.
NEVER EVEN HAD ANY KIDS.

436
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,762
BUT LET'S NOT FORGET

437
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,230
THE POSSUM LAKE LITTLE THEATRE,

438
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,498
THE GOVERNMENT GRANT PLAYERS,

439
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,934
AND THE STILL CONTROVERSIAL
NUDE SCENE IN "OUR TOWN"

440
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:33,739
WERE ALL COURTESY OF THE EFFORTS
OF RODERICK "WEB SWITZER"
FEATHERSTONE.

441
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,575
WE'LL NEVER SEE
ANOTHER ONE LIKE HIM,

442
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,143
AT LEAST THAT'S THE HOPE.

443
00:19:55,994 --> 00:20:00,065
WELL, I THINK WE MAY HAVE
CHANGED THE COURSE OF
REENACTED HISTORY.

444
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,901
WE COULD'VE USED A LITTLE MORE
INSPIRED LEADERSHIP.

445
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,170
PUT A SOCK IN IT, DALTON.
IT WAS ALL YOUR IDEA.

446
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,239
OH, GOOD IDEA,
POORLY EXECUTED.

447
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,374
I'LL HAVE YOU
POORLY EXECUTED.

448
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,112
WE WERE THE
ONLY ONES WITH THE
COSTUMES OUT THERE.

449
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:17,082
MAN, IS IT EVER
HARD TO LEAD GUYS WHEN
YOU'RE WEARING TIGHTS!

450
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,985
WELL, THE GUYS AT CARIBOU LODGE
DIDN'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM.

451
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,453
WELL, NO,
THEY DIDN'T, DID THEY?

452
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,121
THOUSANDS OF THEM
DRESSED AS CLOWNS,

453
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,190
FIRING OFF ALL
THOSE GREEN FLAGS.

454
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,025
YEAH, WHEN THAT
LITTLE CAR TURNED UP,

455
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:30,262
AND ABOUT 100
REINFORCEMENTS HOPPED OUT --

456
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:33,365
HEY, WAIT A SEC.

457
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,567
LOOK AT ALL THE
HITS MIKE AND I TOOK.

458
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:36,902
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU?

459
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,204
WELL, I SPRAINED MY ANKLE
IN A GOPHER HOLE.

460
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,039
YEAH, WHILE YOU
WERE RUNNING AWAY.

461
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:42,174
OH.

462
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,209

WELL, SO WHAT?

OVER YOUR BACK TOO!

464
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:52,317
YEAH, BUT THEY'RE
FROM OUR SIDE.

465
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:55,621
[laughter and applause]

466
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,394
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT WHEN A
COMMANDER LED THE TROOPS

467
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:03,962
THE TROOPS WERE
SUPPOSED TO FOLLOW,

468
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:07,499
NOT STAY BEHIND AND FIRE OFF
ROUNDS FROM THE BEER TENT.

469
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:13,038
THEY WERE FIRING OFF ROUNDS
LONG AFTER THEY RAN OUTTA AMMO.

470
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,241
THERE'S A BIG
STINK ABOUT THAT.

471
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,743
[possum squealing]

472
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,211
OH, MEETING TIME.

473
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,480
YOU GO AHEAD.
I'LL BE DOWN TO
JOIN THE TROOPS LATER.

474
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,449
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHIN',

475
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,818
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT
HOME AFTER THE MEETING.

476
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:29,588
DESPITE HOW I LOOK,
I'M GONNA GO RIGHT TO SLEEP.

477
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:33,458
I'M COVERED WITH FLAGS,
BUT THEY'RE ALL AT HALF MAST.

478
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,093
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,

481
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,166
[applause]

482
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:47,372


483
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,808
OKAY, YOU GOTTA SIT DOWN NOW.

484
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:51,143

00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:53,312

492
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:16,335
I'M A MAN,
BUT I CAN CHANGE,

493
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:20,238
IF I HAVE TO,
I GUESS.

494
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:23,709
AND THE FIRST THING I'M GONNA
CHANGE ARE THESE TIGHTS.

495
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:26,011
THERE'S A BIG STINK ABOUT THAT.

496
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,746
OH, STOP IT.
