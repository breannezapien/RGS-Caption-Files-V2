1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,639
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT TO ME THERE IS
NOTHING WORSE

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:10,377
THAN TAKING YOUR WIFE OUT
FOR A ROMANTIC DINNER
ON A RAINY EVENING

3
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:13,079
ONLY TO GET YOUR ARM SOAKED
WHEN THEY HAND YOUR ORDER

4
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,981
OUT THROUGH
THE WINDOW TO YOU.

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,852
WHAT YOU NEED IS
A COLLAPSIBLE ROOF

6
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:21,287
THAT ATTACHES TO THE OUTSIDE
OF YOUR VEHICLE

7
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,923
AND THEN EXPANDS OVER
TO THE DRIVE-THRU WINDOW

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,760
LIKE ONE OF THOSE N.A.S.A.
DOCKING STATIONS,

9
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:30,063
EXCEPT THIS ONE WON'T BE
USED FOR SOME USELESS
SCIENCE PROJECT.

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,965
OKAY, NOW, WHAT ARE
WE GOING TO USE

11
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,067
FOR OUR COLLAPSIBLE
UMBILICAL DOCKING STATION?

12
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:37,070
I BELIEVE I HAVE
JUST THE THING.

13
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:42,542
I'M GOING TO USE THE
BELLOWS OFF THIS ACCORDION.

14
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,078
I'M NOT A BIG FAN
OF ACCORDION MUSIC.

15
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,380
TO ME THE ONLY DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN AN ACCORDION
AND A TRAMPOLINE

16
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:50,250
IS YOU TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF
TO JUMP ON A TRAMPOLINE.

17
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:56,890
IF THERE ARE ANY MUSIC LOVERS
OUT THERE, YOU'RE WELCOME.

18
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:17,544
[cheering and applause]

19
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,519
THANK YOU VERY MUCH

20
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:30,223
THANK YOU. APPRECIATE THAT.

21
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,626
ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT A GREAT
WEEK TO BE UP AT THE LODGE.

22
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:36,529
HAROLD HAS BEEN PROMOTING
US AS TOURIST FRIENDLY,

23
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,832
AND NOW HE'S RENTED THE WHOLE
PLACE OUT FOR THE WEEKEND

24
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:41,101
TO THESE TREE-HUGGING
NATURALISTS.

25
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,403
I MEAN, IT'S SOME KIND
OF A CORPORATE THING.

26
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,004
THEY'RE SENDING ALL THEIR
SENIOR PEOPLE OR SOMETHING.

27
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:46,973
SO NOW I FIGURE
I'VE GOT TWO CHOICES...

28
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,875
I CAN EITHER HANG
AROUND HERE

29
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:51,377
AND APOLOGIZE FOR
EVERYTHING I'VE EVER DONE

30
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,380
AND AM GOING TO DO,

31
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,083
WHICH IS JUST LIKE
BEING AT HOME,

32
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,486
OR I CAN GO FISHING.

33
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,055
AND I'VE MADE MY DECISION.

34
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,425
UNCLE RED, IT'S A
BEAUTIFUL DAY, ISN'T IT?

35
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:10,930
[cheering and applause]

36
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:14,834
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY.
A BEE-OOTIFUL DAY.

37
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,238
SOMETHING'S WRONG,
ISN'T IT, HAROLD?

38
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,073
WRONG, NO, WHY DOES
SOMETHING HAVE TO BE WRONG?

39
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,810
IT IS A BEAUTIFUL DAY!
BEAUTIFUL DAY.

40
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,645
YOU MESSED UP,
DIDN'T YOU?

41
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,480
MESSED UP?
HOW DID I MESS UP?

42
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,048
OH, NO.
YOU MESSED UP.

43
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:31,151
I DIDN'T MESS UP!
YOU'RE GOING TO GET $500

44
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,652
FOR THE USE OF THE
LODGE THIS WEEKEND.

45
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:34,320
IF THAT'S MESSING UP,

46
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:37,157
THEN MAYBE I SHOULD JUST
MESS UP MORE OFTEN.

47
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,893
OKAY, SO EVERYTHING'S GOOD
AND WE'RE GONNA GET PAID?

48
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:41,394
'CAUSE THIS IS AN
INCONVENIENCE, HAROLD.

49
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:45,999
IT'S NOT AN INCONVENIENCE.
IT'S BUSINESS.

50
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:48,134
SEE, THE LODGE HAD TO
FIND SOME WAY TO START
GENERATING FUNDS,

51
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,702
SO THIS IS WHAT
WE'RE GOING TO DO.

52
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,772
AN INCONVENIENCE.

53
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,541
BEING FORECLOSED ON
AND GOING TO JAIL,

54
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:57,010
THAT'S AN INCONVENIENCE.

55
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:59,512
EVERYTHING'S GOOD.
SO EVERYTHING'S GOOD?

56
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,715
EVERYTHING'S GOOD.
EVERYTHING'S PERFECT?

57
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,817
I KNEW IT.
YOU MESSED UP, DIDN'T YOU?

58
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,886
IT WAS A TYPO.
IT WAS JUST A TYPO.

59
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,721
THAT'S ALL.

60
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:12,225
WELL, I WAS UNDER THE
IMPRESSION THAT THESE GUESTS
WERE SENIOR NATURALISTS.

61
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,194
WHAT?
I WAS WRONG.

62
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:17,063
TURNS OUR THEY'RE
SENIOR NATURISTS.

63
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:19,132
WELL, UM --
DOES THAT MEAN?
WHAT THE HECK

64
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:26,506
[laughter and applause]

65
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:37,684
IT'S TIME FOR THE
POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

66
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:41,888
[cheering and applause]

67
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,527
TODAY'S WINNER RECEIVES
A WEEKEND PASS

68
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,562
AT THE BIGAMIST
ARMS HOTEL,

69
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,598
INCLUDING THE
HONEYMOON SUITE

70
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:54,534
AND A BED THAT
SLEEPS SEVEN.

71
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,436
OKAY, DALTON,
COVER YOUR EARS.

72
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:59,505
RED, YOU'VE GOT 30 SECONDS
TO GET DALTON TO SAY
THIS WORD...

73
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:03,643
YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
WINSTON.

74
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,411
AND GO!

75
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:08,214
OKAY, DALTON, THIS IS
SOMETHING YOU SHOULD FEEL

76
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,515
WHEN YOU THINK
OF YOUR WIFE.

77
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,351
FEAR.

78
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,585
NO.

79
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,487
NO.
GUILT.

80
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,756
REGRET.

81
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,725
NO, DALTON, THIS IS
SOMETHING POSITIVE.

82
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,232
OKAY, OKAY.
NEVER MIND ABOUT THAT.

83
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,301
YOU SEE A YOUNG COUPLE
KISSING UNDER A STREET LIGHT,

84
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,669
YOU SAY, THEY'RE IN...

85
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,771
HEAT.

86
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,539
ALMOST OUT
OF TIME, RED.

87
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,141
YEAH, UM,
ALL RIGHT, WINSTON.

88
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,810
OKAY, DALTON, WHAT IS THE
POINT OF VALENTINE'S DAY?

89
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:41,247
OH, I'M WITH YOU 100%
THERE, RED.

90
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,153
I -- YOU KNOW, I THINK
THIS IS TOO TOUGH.

91
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,988
I'D LOVE TO.
DO YOU WANT TO JUST QUIT?

92
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,624
THERE WE GO!

93
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,966
IF YOURS IS THE STINKIEST
HOUSE ON THE ROAD,

94
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,368
AND NEIGHBORS FEAR
YOUR LAWN MAY EXPLODE,

95
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,604
ME AND MY TRUCK WILL
GRACE YOUR ABODE.

96
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,105
I MAY ARRIVE EMPTY-HANDED,

97
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,940
BUT I'LL SURE
LEAVE WITH A LOAD.

98
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,547
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT VERY SMART
WHEN IT COMES TO HISTORY
OR MATHEMATICS

99
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,050
OR PHYSICS OR CHEMISTRY

100
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:18,818
OR BOTANY OR ZOOLOGY

101
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,521
OR LANGUAGES OR
CALCULUS OR HOME EC.,

102
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:25,158
BUT I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING.
I KNOW HOW CARS WORK.

103
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:28,795
UNLESS THEY'RE NEW CARS OR
DIESELS OR METRIC OR
SOME STUPID THING.

104
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:33,166
BUT FOR EXAMPLE,
I KNOW THAT THIS...

105
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,401
IS A SUPERCHARGER.

106
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,503
RIGHT. GOOD.
THAT WAS LUCKY.

107
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,874
NOW, A SUPERCHARGER
IS BASICALLY A HIGH
SPEED AIR PUMP

108
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:44,844
THAT MAKES AN ENGINE WORK
BETTER BY RAMMING THE
FUEL THROUGH IT.

109
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,746
OKAY, I'M NOT A DOCTOR.

110
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,915
I DON'T EVEN PLAY
ONE ON TELEVISION.

111
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,550
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT THE HUMAN BODY

112
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,252
IS VERY SIMILAR TO
AN AUTOMOBILE.

113
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,588
YOU'VE GOT YOUR
INTAKE MANIFOLD;

114
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,590
YOU'VE GOT
YOUR CARBURETOR;

115
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,359
YOU'VE GOT YOUR ENGINE;

116
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,761
AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR
WHOLE EXHAUST SYSTEM.

117
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,296
AND JUST LIKE
AN AUTOMOBILE,

118
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,798
IT'S BUILT FOR BOTH POWER

119
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,334
AND ENTERTAINMENT.

120
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:11,104
OKAY, BUT JUST LIKE A CAR,
ONCE A GUY GETS A FEW
MILES ON HIM,

121
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,939
HE STARTS TO HAVE PROBLEMS.

122
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,640
THAT'S BECAUSE OVER TIME

123
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,210
THE QUANTITY AND TYPES
OF MATERIAL THAT ARE
GOING IN HERE

124
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,278
FAR EXCEED THE QUANTITY
AND TYPES OF MATERIAL

125
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,647
THAT ARE COMING OUT HERE.

126
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,283
THIS CREATES A SURPLUS
IN THIS AREA,

127
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:28,621
WHICH CAUSES A HIGH BLOOD
PRESSURE SITUATION
UP IN HERE.

128
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:31,524
NOW, THE DOCTORS ARE GOING
TO GIVE YOU ALL KINDS
OF TREATMENTS

129
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,059
FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.

130
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,894
THEY WANT YOU TO TAKE PILLS.
THEY WANT YOU TO EXERCISE.

131
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,796
THEY WANT YOU
TO LOSE WEIGHT.

132
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,931
LET'S BE SERIOUS.

133
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,633
OH, NO, WE NEED
A BETTER WAY.

134
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,468
AND I'M THINKING
SUPERCHARGER.

135
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,972
BECAUSE IF A SUPERCHARGER
CAN HELP A CAR ENGINE BY
MOVING FUEL FASTER,

136
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,373
IT SHOULD BE ABLE
TO HELP A HUMAN ENGINE

137
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,375
BY MOVING BLOOD FASTER.

138
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,710
JUST GIVE ME A FEW
MINUTES TO HOOK THIS UP.

139
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,412
I'LL SHOW YOU
HOW IT WORKS.

140
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:53,813
BY THE WAY,
THIS ISN'T REAL BLOOD.

141
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,615
IT'S CREAM SODA.

142
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,383
AND THIS IS
NOT A REAL PERSON.

143
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,851
IT'S A CIVIL SERVANT.

144
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,322
OKAY, I GOT ALL MY TUBES
HOOKED UP TO A SUPERCHARGER,

145
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:06,726
AND I MOUNTED A HIGH-SPEED
CORDLESS DRILL ON THERE
TO DRIVE THE UNIT.

146
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:10,830
TAPED THE WHOLE THING TOGETHER
USING THE HANDYMAN'S SECRET
WEAPON, DUCT TAPE.

147
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,865
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE
WILL EVEN NOTICE IT.

148
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,134
OF COURSE, NOW, YOU DON'T
WANT THE THING RUNNING
ALL THE TIME.

149
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,004
IT'S JUST FOR EMERGENCIES
WHEN YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE
HITS A SPIKE,

150
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:19,972
YOU KNOW, LIKE WHEN YOU'RE
OPENING A LETTER FROM
THE GOVERNMENT,

151
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,775
OR MAYBE A FRIEND'S
HUSBAND COMES HOME EARLY.

152
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:25,044
SO WHAT I DID IS
I ATTACHED A SWITCH

153
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:26,979
TO THIS BLOOD
PRESSURE READER THING,

154
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,915
AND THAT HOOK UP TO THE
DRILL AND DRIVE THE THING,

155
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,818
AND THEN AS SOON AS THE BLOOD
PRESSURE GETS UP TO,

156
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,487
SAY, HEART ATTACK RANGE,

157
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,857
THE SUPERCHARGER COMES ON.

158
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,659
NOW, IT'S NOT GOING TO
LOWER YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE,

159
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,727
BUT IT TAKES THE LOAD
OFF YOUR HEART

160
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,830
BECAUSE THE SUPERCHARGER
IS DOING MOST OF THE WORK.

161
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,466
I DON'T REALLY
SEE A DOWNSIDE HERE.

162
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,601
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN DON'T
FIND YOU HANDSOME,

163
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,636
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

164
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:58,544
[applause]

165
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,021
OH, I HAD A
THOUGHT LAST WEEK,

166
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,257
AND I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU
BEFORE IT SLIPS AWAY.

167
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,693
YOU KNOW WHEN
I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL,

168
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,795
THE PARENTS AND THE TEACHERS
ALWAYS LIKED THE KIDS

169
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,830
WHO WERE SELF-CONFIDENT
AND SELF-ASSURED.

170
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,232
YOU KNOW THE ONES I MEAN,

171
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,933
THE ONES WHO WOULD TALK
TO YOUR MOM AND DAD

172
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,635
LIKE THEY WERE
THEIR BUDDIES;

173
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,705
OR THEY'D PHONE OVER TO
YOUR HOUSE AND IF YOU
WEREN'T THERE

174
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:29,709
THEY'D HAVE A CONVERSATION
WITH WHOEVER ANSWERED
THE PHONE.

175
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:33,112
PARENTS ALWAYS LIKE KIDS
WHO HAVE THOSE KINDS OF
PEOPLE SKILLS.

176
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,482
MY MOM WOULD SAY, "BOY, THAT
BRIAN IS SUCH A NICE KID.

177
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,818
"HE'S SO OUTGOING."

178
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,153
AND EMPLOYERS
FELT THE SAME WAY.

179
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,756
THESE OUTGOING KIDS
BECAME OUTGOING ADULTS.

180
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,892
THEY GOT GREAT JOBS.

181
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,528
THEY DID REAL WELL, BECAME
LEADERS IN THEIR COMMUNITY,

182
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,596
AND GOOD FOR THEM.
OH, YEAH.

183
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,532
THEY MADE A
CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY,

184
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,400
AND THEY WERE
REWARDED FOR IT.

185
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:58,971
NOW, WOULD SOMEONE PLEASE
TELL THEM TO KNOCK IT OFF.

186
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:04,644
AT MY AGE, I DON'T WANT
TO BE AROUND ANYBODY
THAT OUTGOING.

187
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:08,247
I'D MUCH RATHER SPEND
TIME WITH MY FRIEND ED,

188
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,116
WHO HARDLY EVER
SAYS ANYTHING.

189
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,184
AND WHEN HE DOES,
IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT,

190
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,587
STUFF LIKE
"THAT'S A COP."

191
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,328
THESE DAYS, I JUST DON'T
WANT ANYBODY OUTGOING

192
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:25,464
BUGGING ME WITH
THEIR GOOD MOOD.

193
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:29,035
I'M OLD AND SOMETHING
PROBABLY HURTS.

194
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,337
I'M WELL AWARE I'M IN
THE LAST THIRD OF MY LIFE,

195
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:35,341
AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,
I WANT THE TIME TO DRAG.

196
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:38,644
SO PUT A SOCK IN IT, BRIAN,
I'M GOING FISHING WITH ED.

197
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,446
REMEMBER,
I'M PULLIN' FOR YOU.

198
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,281
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

199
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,090
YOU JUST GOT HOME AND
THERE'S A NEW DENT
IN THE CAR.

200
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:53,693
YEAH.
PUT THERE.
A DENT YOUR WIFE

201
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,262
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO
RIGHT OFF THE DEEP END.

202
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,497
BUT BE CAREFUL.
A LOT OF GUYS
HAVE DROWNED

203
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:02,234
UNDERESTIMATING JUST
HOW DEEP THE DEEP END IS.

204
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,770
YEAH, WE KNOW YOU'VE
NEVER PUT A DENT
IN THE CAR.

205
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:06,472
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE.

206
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,975
LIKE THAT IDIOT WHO
TORE YOUR DOOR OFF

207
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,210
WHEN YOU LEFT IT OPEN TO
GO IN AND BUY MILK.

208
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,312
OR WHEN YOU GOT REAR-ENDED
BECAUSE SOME GOOF
NEVER NOTICED

209
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,581
THAT YOU STOPPED ON
THE HIGHWAY TO PICK UP

210
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,383
WHAT YOU THOUGHT
WAS A DIME.

211
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,018
OR WHEN THE
ENGINE SEIZED-UP

212
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:22,521
BECAUSE NONE OF YOUR
FRIENDS REMINDED YOU
TO CHECK THE OIL.

213
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,491
YOU KNOW, YOU TAKE BETTER
CARE OF THE CARE THAN
YOUR WIFE DOES.

214
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:29,028
BUT THERE'S NO POINT IN
GETTING ALL BENT OUT OF
SHAPE ABOUT A LITTLE DENT

215
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,364
AND THEN HAVE A HEAD-ON
COLLISION AT HOME.

216
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:34,133
NO, DON'T BE THE ONE
TRAPPED IN YOUR VEHICLE.

217
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,801
YOU MAY HAVE A BIG MOUTH,

218
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,638
BUT IT'S NOT
JAWS OF LIFE.

219
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,374
NO, YOU JUST SMILE AND SAY,
"THAT'S OKAY, HONEY."

220
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,676
WE KNOW YOU STILL
LOVE YOUR CAR.

221
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,711
JUST NOT ENOUGH
TO SLEEP IN IT.

222
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,883
OKAY, I'M TRYING TO DO
THE RIGHT THING HERE.

223
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,518
I MEAN, HAROLD
PUT A LOT OF WORK

224
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,553
INTO MARKETING THE LODGE
TO THESE OLD NUDISTS,

225
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,522
AND THEY DON'T REALLY
MEAN ANY HARM, YOU KNOW.

226
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,091
PLUS, 500 BUCKS,
WELL, THAT'S GOOD MONEY.

227
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,527
SO, I MEAN, I'VE ONLY
GOT ONE MORE DAY TO GO,

228
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,295
AND I BELIEVE I'LL
GET THROUGH THIS.

229
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,265
I JUST KEEP LOOKING AT THE
FLOOR AND THINKING
ABOUT BASEBALL.

230
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,002
MR. GREEN, I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

231
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,104
JUST TAKE IT EASY,
MIKE, ALL RIGHT?

232
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:16,042
I DIDN'T MEAN TO LOOK.
I DIDN'T WANT TO LOOK.

233
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,978
THESE PEOPLE ARE LIKE
MY GRANDPARENTS.

234
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,180
THEY SHOULDN'T BE NAKED.

235
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,683
THEY SHOULD BE ON A PORCH
SOMEWHERE, WHITTLING.

236
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,686
YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
BUT IT'S ONLY ONE
MORE DAY, ALL RIGHT?

237
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,954
YOU DIDN'T
SEE WHAT I SAW!

238
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,123
WORSE.
LAWN BOWLING?

239
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,292
TRAMPOLINE.
WHAT?

240
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:38,130
UNCLE RED,
WE GOT A PROBLEM.

241
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,699
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WE GOT A PROBLEM?

242
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,702
IT'S ABOUT
THE 500 DOLLARS.

243
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,503
SEEMS OUR GUESTS FEEL
THAT WE'RE NOT

244
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,238
EMBRACING THE NUDIST
LIFESTYLE QUITE ENOUGH.

245
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,007
SO TOMORROW AT NOON
THEY'RE GOING TO PRESENT

246
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,975
THE $500 CHEQUE TO A
LODGE REPRESENTATIVE.

247
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:53,245
BUT THAT LODGE REPRESENTATIVE
HAS TO BE NAKED.

248
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:56,749
500 BUCK NAKED.
BUCK NAKED?

249
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:15,701
[applause]

250
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,240
I THINK THEY
WANT YOU TO GO.

251
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,542
I THINK WE'RE NOT
GONNA GET PAID.

252
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,080
Red: 
WAS OUT FOR A
 
DRIVE IN THE WAGON,

253
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:31,684
AND UM, I NOTICED THE 
SHERIFF'S CAR IN KIND
 
OF A PROBLEM.

254
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,353
LOOKED LIKE HE HAD RUN HER 
UP ON A HUMP THERE. 

255
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:37,823
AND I WAS LOOKING FOR 
THE SHERIFF INSIDE,
 

256
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:41,794
BUT IT WASN'T THE SHERIFF. 
IT WAS MIKE. 

257
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:45,397
SO ALL THE MORE REASON 
TO GET HER DOWN. 

258
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,567
WELL, I'VE GOT A SHOVEL 
IN THE WAGON,
 

259
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,103
BUT MIKE HAD 
ANOTHER IDEA.
 

260
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:54,507
HE HAS A A DIFFERENT APPROACH 
TO MOST THINGS IN LIFE.
 

261
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:59,812
I DON'T TOTALLY UNDERSTAND 
THE KIND OF LOGIC THAT 
MIKE USES HERE, BUT -- 

262
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:02,515
ANYWAY, I LIKE 
HAVING A WAGON.
 

263
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:06,118
YOU CAN GET A LOT OF 
STUFF INTO A WAGON.
 

264
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,954
YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH 
READY FOR ANYTHING.
 

265
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:11,357
YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN A 
SING-SONG MIGHT SPRING UP.  

266
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,159
THERE WE GO, 
THERE'S THE SHOVEL.
 

267
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,760
ALL RIGHT AND 
GET BACK THERE.
 

268
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,829
AND FAIR ENOUGH, SINCE MIKE 
HAD GOTTEN INTO THE PROBLEM,
 

269
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,931
HE WAS MORE THAN WILLING 
TO ACTUALLY DO THE WORK,
 

270
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:22,401
WHICH I 
APPRECIATED UNTIL -- 

271
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,403
UNTIL HE BROKE THE SHOVEL 

272
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,673
AND THEN THE MIRROR. 

273
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,809
AND OF COURSE MIKE ALWAYS 
HAS ANOTHER IDEA
 

274
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,778
SO WHAT HE FIGURED HE'D DO 
IS HE TOOK THE CHAIN OUT 
OF THE TRUNK THERE 

275
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,947
AND WENT FROM THE BACK 
AXLE OF THE COP CAR 

276
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,784
AND WRAPPED HER AROUND 
THE BACK AXLE OF THE WAGON.  

277
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,787
AND HE SAID, "DON'T WORRY. 
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY 
GO WRONG?" 

278
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,128
ALL RIGHT, WELL, 
NO, THAT'S GOOD.
 

279
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,664
NOW WE DEFINITELY HAVE TO 
GET THE COP CAR OFF
 
OF THE HUMP.

280
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,399
MIKE SAYS THERE'S A 
CONCRETE BLOCK THERE.
 

281
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,768
IF I COULD STICK THE CONCRETE 
BLOCK, WEDGE HER UNDER
 
THE WHEEL,

282
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,804
GIVE HIM SOME TRACTION, 
THEN HE COULD THROWN
 
IT INTO REVERSE

283
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,041
AND THAT MIGHT JUST HUMP 
IT RIGHT OFF THERE. 

284
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,976
WELL, I'LL GIVE HER A GO.  

285
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,711
HE REVS HER UP, 
POPS HER INTO REVERSE, 

286
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:09,148
AND IT DID CATCH 
FOR A SECOND. 

287
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,751
AND INTO THE RAVINE. 

288
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:14,386
OKAY, MIKE, NOW WHAT? 

289
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,155
WELL, MIKE FIGURED WE'VE 
STILL GOT THE CHAINS  

290
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,857
BETWEEN THE TWO 
SETS OF REAR ENDS, 

291
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,592
SO WHY DON'T WE PUT 
THE WHEELS UP IN THERE?
 

292
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,293
THAT'LL SHOOT 
THE WHEELS BACK, 

293
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,562
AND CHAIN WILL PULL 
THE UNIT OFF THE HUMP.  

294
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,664
AND I WAS REALLY TOO TIRED 
TO THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE,
 

295
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,199
SO I -- 

296
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,468
BUT THIS TIME MIKE DIDN'T 
GET INTO THE VEHICLE,
 

297
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,570
WHICH ULTIMATELY 
WAS A GREAT IDEA.
 

298
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,939
THEY KICKED OFF THERE. 
PULLED HER OFF AND AWAY -- 

299
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,441
BUT SHE'S HEADING 
THE RAVINE, MIKE.
 

300
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:36,675
DO YOU THINK PERHAPS 
WE SHOULD... 

301
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,911
YES, LET'S... 

302
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:40,813
NO, SHE HIT A TREE!  

303
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:43,349
WE'RE GOOD. 
NO, WE'RE GOOD.
 

304
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,050
OKAY. 

305
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,319
EVERYTHING'S FINE OFFICER. 
NOTHING TO SEE HERE. 

306
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,793
WELCOME TO THE EXPERTS
PORTION OF THE SHOW

307
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,163
WHERE WE ADDRESS THOSE THREE
LITTLE WORDS THAT MEN FIND
SO HARD TO SAY...

308
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,000
audience: I DON'T KNOW! 

309
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,501
EXCELLENT. 

310
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,270
AND JOINING RED TODAY
IS LODGE MEMBER

311
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:07,373
AND LOCAL ANTIQUE,
MR. DALTON HUMPHREY.

312
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,109
THAT'S ANTIQUE DEALER.

313
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:12,878
OH, SORRY.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

314
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,748
TODAY'S LETTER
READS AS FOLLOWS...

315
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,283
"DEAR EXPERTS,

316
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:20,686
"RECENTLY I BOUGHT ONE OF
THOSE HOME BARBER KITS
FOR MY FAMILY.

317
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,522
"IT WORKS REALLY WELL,
AND WE ALL HAD A LOT
OF FUN WITH IT.

318
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,191
"MY QUESTION IS CAN YOU
RECOMMEND A STYLE OF HAT

319
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,061
"THAT MY WHOLE FAMILY COULD
WEAR FOR THE NEXT
MONTH OR TWO?"

320
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:35,000
YEAH, OKAY. I MEAN HATS
CAN BE SMART LOOKING,

321
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,669
AND THIS GUY
NEEDS SOMETHING

322
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,871
TO MAKE HIM LOOK SMART
AT THIS POINT, I WOULD SAY.

323
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:42,274
WE HAVE A FINE SELECTION
OF HATS AT HUMPHREY'S
EVERYTHING STORE.

324
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,944
YOU KNOW, I DON'T
PERSONALLY DON'T WEAR HATS.

325
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:48,347
NO, YOU'D HAVE TO
GO WITH AN ONION BAG.

326
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,750
YOU KNOW,
I RECOMMEND
THE HARD-HAT.

327
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:54,853
THAT WAY YOU CAN COMBINE
STYLE WITH SAFETY.

328
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,722
WELL, SEE, OKAY, I HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH THAT.

329
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,724
SEE, I DON'T THINK PEOPLE
SHOULD WEAR HATS

330
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,659
THEY DON'T HONESTLY USE
IN THEIR DAILY LIFE.

331
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,761
NOW A HARD-HAT, WELL,
THAT'S FINE FOR YOU, WINSTON,

332
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,730
BECAUSE THERE'S
A REASON FOR THAT.

333
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,565
YOU KNOW, I MEAN YOU EITHER
USE IT IN YOUR WORK,

334
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,934
OR YOU HAVE A SOFT
HEAD OR SOMETHING.

335
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,303
BUT THAT GUY
IN THE VILLAGE PEOPLE,

336
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:14,073
I DON'T THINK SO.

337
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,209
SO YOU'RE SAYING DON'T WEAR
A COWBOY HAT IF YOU'RE
NOT A COWBOY.

338
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,978
WELL, EXACTLY.

339
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,113
IF YOU'RE OUT
THERE DRIVING CATTLE
OR MENDING FENCES, FINE.

340
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,250
BUT EATING BAKED
BEANS IS NOT ENOUGH.

341
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,419
OKAY, BUT, UH, BUT WHAT
ABOUT A BERET?

342
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,088
SAME DEAL.
SAME DEAL WITH A BERET.

343
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,890
IF YOU WEAR A BERET
YOU'D BETTER

344
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,226
EITHER BE PART OF A SPECIAL
MILITARY STRIKE FORCE

345
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,929
OR ON YOUR WAY TO
A POETRY READING.

346
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:39,832
AND IF YOU'RE BOTH,
YOU'VE GOT SOME SERIOUS
DECISIONS TO MAKE

347
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:43,302
ABOUT WHERE YOUR
LIFE IS GOING.

348
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:47,840
THAT'S A MILITARY HAT
YOU'RE WEARING,
ISN'T IT, RED?

349
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,409
YEAH, HOW MANY YEARS WAS
IT THAT YOU SERVED,
AGAIN, RED?

350
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,448
UH, WELL, UH, HEY, I'VE
BEEN MARRIED 35 YEARS,

351
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,585
I SERVED
EVERY ONE OF THEM.

352
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:02,488
NO, NO, THAT'S NOT AN
OFFICIAL MILITARY ASSIGNMENT.

353
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,457
THAT'S MORE OF A VOLUNTEER
CIVILIAN POSITION.

354
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,992
WELL, OKAY, OKAY.

355
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,527
BUT I'VE HAD THIS HAT
A LONG TIME, ALL RIGHT?

356
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,596
IT'S CALLED A
FIELD MANOEUVRES CAP.

357
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,231
I GOT IT DURING
MY DATING YEARS,

358
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:15,234
AND I HAD A FEW FIELD
MANOEUVRES, BELIEVE ME.

359
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,870
TOO BAD YOU NEVER
SAW ACTIVE SERVICE.

360
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:21,874
[laughter and applause]

361
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,912
I'LL TELL YOU THE MAIN
PROBLEM WITH DOORBELLS.

362
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,314
THEY'RE TOO DARN CLOSE
TO THE HOUSE.

363
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,818
YOU DON'T GET TIME TO
GET YOURSELF READY TO
ANSWER THE DOOR.

364
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,320
THIS WAS MADE VERY
CLEAR TO ME LAST WEEK.

365
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,523
I WAS ON MY WAY
INTO THE SHOWER,

366
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,325
AND I WAS DRESSED
APPROPRIATELY FOR
THAT ASSIGNMENT.

367
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,230
SUDDENLY MY DOORBELL RINGS.

368
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,599
WELL, I ASSUMED IT WAS
ONE OF THE GUYS,

369
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,435
AND I DIDN'T REALLY
HAVE TIME TO GET DRESSED,

370
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,237
SO I JUST ANSWERED
THE DOOR ALFRESCO.

371
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,106
OF COURSE, IT'S NOT
ONE OF THE GUYS.

372
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,808
IT'S AN OLDER LADY
COLLECTING MONEY

373
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,577
FOR THE HEART ATTACK
AND STROKE FOUNDATION.

374
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,513
SHE TOOK ONE LOOK AT ME,
AND I BELIEVE SHE HAD
ONE OF EACH.

375
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,416
SO I NEED SOMETHING TO GIVE
ME MORE TIME TO PREPARE
FOR MY VISITORS.

376
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,585
SO I'M MOVING THE
DOORBELL FROM THE DOOR

377
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,487
OVER HERE TO THE DRIVEWAY.

378
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,489
NOW, I JUST NEED SOME
SORT OF TRIGGERING DEVICE.

379
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,925
ANYONE WHO'S EVER DRIVEN
A CAR KNOWS THAT A POP CAN

380
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,894
EMITS A WEIRD KIND OF
GRAVITY TO ANY DRIVER.

381
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:18,063
YOU CAN'T SEE A POP CAN
WITHOUT DRIVING OVER IT.

382
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,499
SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS
ATTACH ONE WIRE TO THE TAB

383
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,734
AND THEN THE OTHER ONE I'VE
GOT A LEAD SINKER ON THERE,

384
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,670
I'M GOING TO DROP THAT
DOWN INSIDE THE HOLE

385
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,805
AND I GOT A WAD OF THE
HANDYMAN'S SECRET WEAPON

386
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,841
TO STOP THE SINKER FROM
HITTING THE BOTTOM
OF THE CAN.

387
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,709
BUT LISTEN TO WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN THE CAN MOVES.

388
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,444
[doorbell buzzer]

389
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,248
[doorbell buzzer]

390
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:40,452
BUT TALK IS CHEAP.
LET'S HAVE A DEMONSTRATION.

391
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:41,753
BETTER YET,

392
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,322
LET'S HAVE
A CHEAP DEMONSTRATION.

393
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:51,463
[doorbell buzzing incessantly]

394
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,602
[doorbell continues buzzing incessantly]

395
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,975
COME ON, UNCLE RED.

396
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,477
IF YOU WANT TO SEE ANY
OF THAT MONEY YOU BETTER
GET THOSE CLOTHES OFF.

397
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,246
HAROLD, CAN YOU IMAGINE
SOMEBODY TUNING
IN RIGHT NOW?

398
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,948
WHAT WOULD
THEY THINK?

399
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:14,119
OH.
O-O-H!

400
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,457
NO!

401
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,692
WELL, DO YOU WANT TO SEE
ANY OF THAT $500 OR NOT?

402
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,895
WELL, HAROLD, JUST A SEC.
I HAVE SOME PRIDE HERE.

403
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,696
IT'S HARD TO PUT
A PRICE TAG ON THAT.

404
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,965
COME ONE, 30 BUCKS TOPS.
COME ON.

405
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,934
JUST A MINUTE
HERE, HAROLD.

406
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,171
THE NUDISTS SAID THEY WOULD
PAY A REPRESENTATIVE
OF THE LODGE

407
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:33,705
AS LONG AS
HE WAS NAKED.

408
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,174
IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE ME.

409
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,376
YOU'RE NOT GOING
SEND A DOG, ARE YOU?

410
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,545
NO, NO, NO.
IT'S ALL TAKEN
CARE OF, HAROLD.

411
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,547
COME ON
IN HERE, MIKE.

412
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:50,756
[laughter and applause]

413
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,335
I DON'T HAVE A GOOD
FEELING ABOUT THIS.

414
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,572
WELL, HE'S NOT
EXACTLY NAKED.

415
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:10,209
WELL, I'VE GOT TO WEAR THIS.
I'M A NON-SWIMMER.

416
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:13,111
HEY, THEY'RE THE ONES WHO
PICKED THE MAIN DOCK
TO DO THIS.

417
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:16,548
SAFETY TAKES PRECEDENCE
OVER EXHIBITIONISM.

418
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,051
C'MON, MIKE.
I'LL HOLD THE
DOOR FOR YOU.

419
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,456
YOU'RE A VERY
BRAVE MAN, MIKE.

420
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,391
THANK YOU,
HAROLD.

421
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,460
WELL, HERE GOES
NOTHING.

422
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,064
[pop!]

423
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,932
[Mike screaming]

424
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:37,769
[applause]

425
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,443
[possum squealing]

426
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,245
OH, GOOD.
IT'S MEETING TIME!

427
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,747
OH, YEAH!
YOU GO AHEAD, HAROLD.

428
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,515
I'LL BE DOWN
IN A MINUTE.

429
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,718
OKAY, IF MY WIFE
IS WATCHING,

430
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,820
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT
HOME FROM THE MEETING.

431
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:59,324
AND ACTUALLY I SAVED YOU THE
EMBARRASSMENT OF SHOWING
THE WHOLE WORLD

432
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,560
WHAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK
AT EVERY NIGHT.

433
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:05,530
WELL, MAYBE NOT EVERY NIGHT,
BUT HOPEFULLY TONIGHT.

434
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,199
AND TO THE REST OF YOU
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

435
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,334
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND
THE WHOLE GANG UP HERE
AT POSSUM LODGE,

436
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:11,136
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

437
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:15,440
[applause]

438
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,876
Dalton: SIT DOWN.
OH, ALL RISE!

439
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,149
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI. 

440
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,389
Red: ALL RIGHT, BOW YOUR
HEADS FOR THE MEN'S PRAYER.

441
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:33,058
I'M A MAN,
BUT I CAN CHANGE,

442
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:36,228
IF I HAVE TO,
I GUESS.

443
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,637
WANT TO SIT DOWN?

444
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:50,976
