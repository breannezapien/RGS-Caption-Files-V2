1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:03,770
WORK IS BAD.

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,638
AND DIGGING POST HOLES
IS THE WORST.

3
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:07,173
UNLESS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TOOL.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,042
AND, OF COURSE, WE DO.

5
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,249
NOW, ALL YOU HAVE TO
DO IS JACK SQUAT.

6
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:19,519
GET YOURSELF A JACK AND SQUAT.

7
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,821
AND THE HEAVIER THE VEHICLE
AND THE WETTER THE HOLE,

8
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:24,257
THE DEEPER YOUR POST HOLE.

9
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,793
REMEMBER, ANY TOOL
CAN BE THE RIGHT TOOL.

10
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,698
IT'S THE RED GREEN SHOW!!!

11
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:34,634
AND NOW, HERE'S THE MAN WHO
TURNED TELEVISION ON ITS EAR

12
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,136
AND GOT IT STUCK UP HIS NOSE.

13
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,504
YOUR HOST AND HERO, MY UNCLE:

14
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,639
RED GREEEEEN!!!

15
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:43,109
[applause]

16
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:50,817
THANK-YOU VERY MUCH.

17
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,253
THANK YOU.
APPRECIATE IT.

18
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:54,888
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

19
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:57,490
IT'S ELECTION TIME HERE
IN THE POSSUM LAKE AREA.

20
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,994
LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER SHOE-IN
FOR OUR MAYOR, WALLY KIBLER.

21
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,930
WE CALL HIM "KICKBACK" KIBLER.

22
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,533
I DO NOT KNOW
HOW THIS GUY KEEPS
GETTING RE-ELECTED.

23
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,201
WELL, NOBODY RUNS AGAINST HIM.

24
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,737
THAT HELPS.

25
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,372
THE GUY IS SUCH A CROOK.

26
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,540
SEE, THAT'S IT.

27
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:14,741
EVERYBODY JUST
COMPLAINS ABOUT HIM.

28
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:16,643
YOU CAN'T JUST COMPLAIN
YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

29
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:18,044
WELL, PEOPLE LIKE
COMPLAINING, HAROLD.

30
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,512
IT FEELS GOOD, AND IT
MAKES YOU FEEL IMPORTANT

31
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,314
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO ANYTHING.

32
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,016
YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT GOING
TO GET US A NEW MAYOR.

33
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,651
WE NEED ANOTHER
CANDIDATE, YEAH.

34
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:27,854
I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING
OF THROWING MY OWN HAT
IN THE RING.

35
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,423
YOU DON'T HAVE A HAT.

36
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,060
THAT'S TRUE, BUT YOU DO.

37
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,399
YOU THINK I MIGHT MAKE
A GOOD MAYOR, HAROLD?

38
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,201
ABSOLUTELY, YEAH.

39
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,936
YOU SAID PEOPLE
LOVE TO COMPLAIN.

40
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:44,237
WITH YOU AS A MAYOR,

41
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,773
THEY WOULD HAVE
A MILLION REASONS.

42
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,916
IT'S TIME TO PLAY
"THE POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME."

43
00:01:56,983 --> 00:02:00,220
MR. MIKE HAMAR IS PLAYING
FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS.

44
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:04,924
[applause]

45
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:08,595
PROVIDING HE SCRATCHES
THREE IDENTICAL SYMBOLS.

46
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,630
UNCLE RED,

47
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:14,000
YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS TO GET
MR. HAMAR TO SAY THIS WORD:

48
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:20,940
GO!!!

49
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:22,041
ALL RIGHT, MIKE,

50
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:23,877
TWO PEOPLE
JOINED LEGALLY.

51
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:25,211
CELLMATES?

52
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,713
YOU'RE AT A WEDDING.

53
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:29,649
THE BRIDE AND
GROOM GET...

54
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,851
LUCKY!

55
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,586
OKAY, MIKE.

56
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,156
BERNICE AND I,
WE ARE...?

57
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:38,258
OLD.

58
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,361
HEY, HEY, HEY!

59
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,196
HOME SHOPPING NETWORK?

60
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,464
C'MON!

61
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,065
YOU'RE ALMOST OUT
OF TIME, UNCLE RED.

62
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,200
THERE'S A SONG:

63
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,068
I'M GETTING SOMETHING
IN THE MORNING.

64
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:51,237
YOU'RE GETTING SOMETHING
IN THE MORNING?

65
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,405
YEAH.

66
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,240
WELL, THAT'S UNUSUAL
FOR A MARRIED GUY.

67
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,075
[ring! ring! ring!]

68
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,587
OH MAN...

69
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,289
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT
WAS SUCH A GREAT IDEA.

70
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,857
NO, IT'S GREAT,
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

71
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,125
RUNNING FOR MAYOR.

72
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,726
HA! HA! HA!

73
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,795
THAT'S GREAT!

74
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,664
HAVE YOU EVER RUN
FOR ANYTHING BEFORE?

75
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,998
COVER.

76
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,533
[laughter]

77
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,834
THIS IS GOING
TO BE DIFFERENT

78
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,636
'CAUSE WE'RE GOING TO RUN
A GOOD, CLEAN CAMPAIGN

79
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,605
AND KNOCK MAYOR KIBLER
RIGHT OUT OF OFFICE.

80
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:26,973
NO, HAROLD.

81
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,575
YOU'RE MY
CAMPAIGN MANAGER
AND I'M RUNNING.

82
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:29,842
THAT'S TWO VOTES.

83
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,678
WE'VE GOT BERNICE,
SO THAT'S THREE.

84
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:33,580
IF THEY GET THE SAME TURNOUT
AS THEY DID LAST YEAR,

85
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:36,482
WE'RE GOING TO NEED
EIGHT MORE VOTES TO WIN.

86
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,651
YOU'RE FORGETTING
OUR MAJOR ADVANTAGE.

87
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,819
WHAT'S THAT?

88
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,754
YOU'RE A TELEVISION STAR.

89
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:45,124
OKAY, NOT A STAR,
BUT A PERSONALITY.

90
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,993
A PERSONALITY.

91
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,562
IT'S NOT A GOOD
PERSONALITY.

92
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,464
WE NEED A SLOGAN!

93
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,399
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED,
WE NEED A SLOGAN!

94
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:56,102
YOU KNOW, JERRY SPRINGER
WAS MAYOR OF CINCINNATI.

95
00:03:56,169 --> 00:04:00,073
THAT'S NOT GOING
TO HELP US, REALLY.

96
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,175
I NEED A PHRASE.

97
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,111
THEY HAVE THE POSTERS
AND THEY HAVE BUTTONS.

98
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,046
THE POLITICIANS GO AND
THEY GET THE WINNEBAGOS.

99
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:08,648
I WOULD LOVE A 37 FOOTER.

100
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,049
I'D GET THE
"BIG 8" IN THERE

101
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,251
AND I'D GET
THE AUTOMATIC

102
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:12,885
AND I'D GET
THE MICROWAVE.

103
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,554
WHAT'S GOING ON?

104
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,089
WHAT'S THE DECOY FOR?

105
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,157
I'M GOING TO TAKE
A PICTURE FOR THE SLOGAN.

106
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,226
WHAT'S OUR SLOGAN?

107
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,594
ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

108
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,062
"THE BUCK STOPS HERE."

109
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,466
[laughter and applause]

110
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,003
IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO MARRY
LATER IN LIFE 

111
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,472
I KNOW HOW YOU CAN
FIND A GOOD WIFE 

112
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:34,974
A WOMAN WITH SAVVY
WHO KNOWS THE SCORE 

113
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,577
A WOMAN WHO'S SEEN
IT ALL BEFORE 

114
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:40,179
OH, MARRY A WIDOW 

115
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:42,815
SOMEONE WHO CAN'T BE FOOLED 

116
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,884
LISTEN KIDDO 

117
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,387
YOU'RE THE KIND WHO
NEEDS TO BE RULED 

118
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:51,424
A WIDOW WILL SCARE YOU
LIKE NOBODY CAN 

119
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,994
ESPECIALLY IF SHE KILLED
HER FIRST OLD MAN 

120
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,634
YOU KNOW, ALMOST EVERYBODY
IN THE WORLD HAS A DREAM.

121
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,936
SOME DREAM ABOUT
TRAVELLING IN SPACE,

122
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:06,339
OR FINDING A CURE FOR A DISEASE,

123
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,242
OR FINALLY HAVING WORLD PEACE.

124
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,411
ME, I HAVE A DREAM.

125
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,846
I NEVER TOLD ANYBODY THIS.

126
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:17,150
I DREAM OF NOT GETTING
ANY ELECTRICAL BILLS.

127
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:20,586
SO, THIS WEEK ON
"HANDYMAN CORNER,"

128
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,556
I'M GOING TO MAKE
MY DREAM COME TRUE.

129
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,391
YOU KNOW, THE CHEAPEST
FORM OF ELECTRICITY

130
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,493
IS WATER FALLING
THROUGH A TURBINE.

131
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,128
THEY CALL THAT HYDRO.

132
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:30,496
NOT HYDRA.

133
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:33,066
HYDRA IS A MYTHICAL BEAST WITH
NINE HEADS THAT CAN'T BE KILLED.

134
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:34,233
YOU DON'T WANT THAT.

135
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,668
YOU WANT HYDRO...

136
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,570
LIKE NIAGARA FALLS WHERE
THE HONEYMOONERS GO

137
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,372
TO GET THE SPARKS FLYING.

138
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,140
HOW DO YOU MAKE A TURBINE?

139
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,042
WELL, A TURBINE IS
JUST A WATER WHEEL.

140
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,444
WHICH IS THE SAME
AS ONE OF THOSE...

141
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,745
GET AWAY!

142
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:46,946
EXERCISE...

143
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,514
GET AWAY!

144
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,249
EXERCISE WHEELS IN
A HAMSTER'S CAGE.

145
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,951
VICIOUS LITTLE FELLOW.

146
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,320
SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
GET TOO MUCH EXERCISE?

147
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:55,655
SO, ALL WE'VE GOT TO DO IS...

148
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,691
MOUNT THIS WHEEL ON
THE SHAFT OF A CAR ALTERNATOR.

149
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,026
LIKE THAT ONE.

150
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,128
AND, THAT'S OUR HYDRO GENERATOR.

151
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,131
NOW, ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS
PUT THE WHOLE THING INTO
SOME FALLING WATER.

152
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,100
YOU HAVE GOT LOTS
OF OPTIONS, HERE.

153
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,235
WHAT YOU CAN DO IS GO TO
ONE OF YOUR DOWNSPOUTS,

154
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,037
CUT A SLOT IN THE SIDE

155
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,306
AND MOUNT THE UNIT
WITH THE WHEEL INSIDE.

156
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,941
THEN, WHEN THE WATER
FALLS OFF THE ROOF,

157
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,309
THE WHEEL SPINS.

158
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,744
IT CRANKS UP THE GENERATOR

159
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,612
AND YOU'VE GOT ELECTRICITY.

160
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:22,215
THE PROBLEM THERE IS YOU ONLY
GET ELECTRICITY WHEN IT RAINS.

161
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,717
WHICH IS FINE, IF YOU LIVE
IN ENGLAND OR VANCOUVER,

162
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,419
BUT FOR NORMAL PEOPLE,

163
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,021
WE NEED A MORE CONSTANT
SOURCE OF FALLING WATER.

164
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,523
SO, I SUGGEST INSTEAD,

165
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,992
WHAT YOU DO IS GET A PIECE OF
YOUR NORMAL HOUSEHOLD DRAINPIPE,

166
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,061
AND YOU MOUNT YOUR
TURBINE UNIT IN THAT.

167
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,929
CUT A SLOT AND
STICK HER RIGHT IN.

168
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,799
AND YOU STICK THIS
INTO THE MAIN DRAIN IN
THE BASEMENT OF YOUR HOUSE.

169
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,901
THAT WAY, ALL THE WATER THAT
COMES FROM YOUR SINK,

170
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,271
YOUR BATHTUB, WASHING MACHINE,
SHOWER, TOILET, OR WHATEVER.

171
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,373
IT IS GOING TO
GENERATE ELECTRICITY.

172
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,208
IN FACT, IF YOU GET A COUPLE
OF DOZEN BEER DRINKERS OVER,

173
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,244
YOU CAN LIGHT UP A STADIUM.

174
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,645
I'M GETTING AHEAD OF MYSELF.

175
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,046
THE FIRST THING
WE'VE GOT TO DO

176
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:56,716
IS MOUNT THE WHEEL ONTO
OUR CAR ALTERNATOR, HERE.

177
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,017
[smash!]

[clang!]

179
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:03,623
SHE'S RUSTED OUT A LITTLE
AND THAT'S A SETBACK.

180
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,158
BUT, YOU KNOW,

181
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:06,692
ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS
ABOUT THE LODGE,

182
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,997
IT'S AN UNLIMITED SOURCE
FOR CAR ALTERNATORS.

183
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,332
OH, YEAH!

184
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:17,870
UNFORTUNATELY,
A LOT OF THEM ARE STILL
IN THEIR ORIGINAL PACKAGE.

185
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,106
BUT, "FINDERS KEEPERS."

186
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,609
[clang!]

187
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:26,712
[bang!]

188
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,619
[whack! whack! whack!]

189
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,657
ALL RIGHT, IF THE MOUNTAIN
WON'T COME TO MOHAMMED,

190
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:40,226
WE'LL JUST ADD
A FEW EXTENSION CORDS.

191
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,728
AND ALSO, WE'VE GONE
TO A DIFFERENT SYSTEM.

192
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,797
BECAUSE IT'S A BETTER SYSTEM

193
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,799
AND ALSO BECAUSE,

194
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:50,536
THAT ALTERNATOR WASN'T COMING
OUT WITHOUT SOME KIND OF
NUCLEAR INTERVENTION.

195
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,805
WE'RE STILL GOING TO GET
OUR POWER OFF THE ALTERNATOR.

196
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,575
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE IT
RIGHT OUT OF THE CAR.

197
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,377
NOW, WE'RE COOKING WITH GAS.

198
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,246
ACTUALLY, A CIGARETTE LIGHTER.

199
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,682
[buzzzz!]

200
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,283
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT
OF BENEFITS TO THIS, EH?

201
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,651
IT'S SAFER THAN
NORMAL ELECTRICITY

202
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:07,253
BECAUSE IT'S ONLY 12 VOLTS

203
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,688
AND IT'S GOT TO BE CHEAPER

204
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,923
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE IN THE CAR.

205
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,859
I DON'T SEE A DOWN SIDE.

206
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,494
UNLESS, THE OWNER SHOWS UP.

207
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,761
SO, REMEMBER...

208
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,296
"IF THE WOMEN DON'T
FIND YOU HANDSOME,

209
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:18,798
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY."

210
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,300
[engine roaring]

[kaboom!]

213
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,848
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU GUYS
WHO WHEN YOU WERE A KID,

214
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,484
REALLY ADMIRED THOSE
TOUGH T.V. HEROES.

215
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,620
YOU KNOW THE GUYS I MEAN.

216
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,355
THE ONES THAT WERE OUTCASTS,

217
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:45,825
STANDING TALL, ALONE,
READY TO TAKE ON ANYONE.

218
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,760
AND, NOW THAT YOU'RE AN ADULT,

219
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,161
YOU'VE BEEN THERE, HAVEN'T YOU?

220
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,097
AN OUTCAST,

221
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,766
STANDING TALL, ALONE.

222
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:57,503
USUALLY, IN FRONT
OF YOUR OWN HOME.

223
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,941
YOU MIGHT EVEN HAVE BEEN
TEMPTED TO DRAW A LINE
IN THE DRIVEWAY

224
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,743
AND MAKE A STAND.

225
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,344
AND IT MIGHT HAVE WORKED,

226
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,914
IF ANYBODY HAD LOOKED OUT
THE LIVING ROOM WINDOW.

227
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,982
BUT, YOU'RE SMART
ENOUGH TO REALIZE

228
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:15,955
THAT LYING COMFORTABLY IN YOUR
OWN BED IS BETTER THAN STANDING
TALL IN THE TOOLSHED.

229
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:19,091
SURE, SUCKING UP AND
APOLOGIZING HURTS.

230
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:21,127
IT HURTS BAD.

231
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:24,463
I MEAN, THE GROVELLING ALONE CAN
FEEL LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO DIE.

232
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,032
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

233
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,800
YOU'RE TOUGH.

234
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,735
MARRIED TOUGH.

235
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,805
AND IF YOU'RE NOT HURTING,

236
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,740
YOU'RE NOT TRYING.

237
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:39,545
[applause]

238
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,247
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YA.

239
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,349
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

240
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:52,158
I'VE BEEN DRIVING ALL OVER TOWN
IN THE POSSUM VAN, CAMPAIGNING.

241
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:55,328
I LOVE THE SMELL OF EXHAUST
FUMES IN THE MORNING.

242
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:58,197
SMELLS LIKE VICTORY.

243
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,632
I DON'T KNOW, UNCLE RED.

244
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,301
"KICKBACK" KIBLER HAS
A LOT OF FRIENDS

245
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,669
IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY.

246
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,439
THE CIVIL SERVICE, THE PTA,
AND ALL THE CHURCH GROUPS.

247
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:07,707
WHO DO WE HAVE?

248
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,042
MOOSE THOMPSON AND
STINKY PETERSON.

249
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,577
OLD MAN SEDGEWICK SAID
HE'S LEANING YOUR WAY,

250
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:14,347
BUT I THINK
HE WAS REFERRING
TO HIS BAD POSTURE.

251
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:15,781
DON'T WORRY, HAROLD.

252
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,918
MY CAMPAIGN PROMISES ARE
WINNING EVERYBODY OVER.

253
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,386
HI, I'M RED GREEN.

254
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,822
VOTE FOR A CHANGE.

255
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,725
I'M REALLY
GETTING INTO THIS.

256
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,326
THESE ARE GOOD.

257
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,261
"I PROMISE NOT TO RAISE TAXES."

258
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,197
"I PROMISE TO INCREASE
SPENDING ON EDUCATION."

259
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,498
YEAH, BUT NOT TOO MUCH.

260
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,600
IF THEY GET TOO SMART,
THEY WON'T VOTE FOR ME.

261
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:38,137
"I PROMISE FULL EMPLOYMENT
AND MORE HAPPINESS."

262
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,439
"I PROMISE GOOD WEATHER
ON EVERY WEEKEND."

263
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:43,242
HOW DO YOU PLAN ON
KEEPING THAT ONE?

264
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,411
WELL, I'M GOING WITH 
A FLEXIBLE WORKWEEK.

265
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,980
IF IT'S A NICE DAY,
IT'S A SATURDAY.

266
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:52,151
[laughter and applause]

267
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:58,090
THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN
KEEP THESE PROMISES.

268
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,493
YEAH, I KNOW,
THAT'S NUMBER 12.

269
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,528
VOTERS DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO KEEP YOUR PROMISES.

270
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,730
UNCLE RED, YOU'VE GOT
A DEBATE IN TWO HOURS
WITH YOUR OPPONENT.

271
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,199
PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING
GOOD PLATFORMS AND
GOOD IDEAS.

272
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:08,701
HAROLD, THEY ARE NOT.

273
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,102
I TRIED THAT AND
NOBODY LIKED IT.

274
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,038
SO NOW, I JUST GIVE
THEM WHAT THEY WANT.

275
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,839
FALSE HOPE AND LIES?

276
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,975
AND YOU THOUGHT I'D MAKE
A LOUSY POLITICIAN.

277
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,815
ALL RIGHT GUYS,
IT'S NEW MEMBER NIGHT

278
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:26,852
AND EARL BATTERSBY IS HERE
WITH A GUY HE'S PRESENTING.

279
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,822
JUST DON'T JUDGE
A BOOK BY ITS COVER.

280
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,892
[laughter]

281
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,660
THANK-YOU, RED.

282
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:37,329
GENTLEMEN, I WANT YOU
TO OPEN YOUR MINDS

283
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,498
TO THE POSSIBILITY
OF OTHER REALITIES.

284
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,601
THAT MAYBE, SOME PEOPLE
ARE NOT LIKE YOU.

285
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:46,505
FOR EXAMPLE, TAKE
ELMO RAY THORNTON, HERE.

286
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:50,276
ELMO IS AN UNUSUAL
HUMAN BEING.

287
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,012
SURE, HE APPEARS
SLOW-WITTED.

288
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:59,418
Earl:
HE'S BORING TO TALK TO.

289
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,053
HE MAY BE A
LITTLE STANDOFFISH

290
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,322
AND MAYBE HE DOESN'T BATHE
AS OFTEN AS YOU OR ME,

291
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,524
OR A CAT.

292
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:10,296
BUT, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
PEOPLE ARE ABDUCTED BY ALIENS.

293
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:13,399
I HAVE CONCRETE EVIDENCE

294
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:18,704
THAT ELMO WAS KIDNAPPED
BY EXTRATERRESTRIALS
EARLY LAST SUMMER

295
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,373
AND HE HAS MARKINGS
ON HIS LOWER BACKSIDE

296
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,644
THAT HE WOULD BE HAPPY
TO SHOW ANY SKEPTIC.

297
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,580
IF THAT'S NOT ENOUGH PROOF,

298
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,715
TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT ELMO.

299
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,822
RECOGNIZE HIM?

300
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:40,493
MAYBE YOU REMEMBER HIM
AS ELLIE MAY THORNTON

301
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,096
PRIOR TO THE ALIEN ABDUCTION?

302
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:47,099
AND HE CAME BACK WITH
A WHOLE NEW HANDLE.

303
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,971
THIS MAN HAS SUFFERED ENOUGH.

304
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:54,173
MAKE HIM A NEW MEMBER
OF THE POSSUM LODGE,

305
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,177
SO, HE CAN TAKE THAT FIRST STEP
ON THE PATH OF A NORMAL LIFE.

306
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,212
THANK-YOU.

307
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,281
ALL THOSE IN FAVOUR?

308
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,920
IF YOU'RE NOT CONVINCED,
WE CAN SHOW YOU THE MARKS
ON HIS BACKSIDE, IF YOU LIKE?

309
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,122
[lodge members]
AYE!!!

310
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,390
CONGRATULATIONS, ELMO.

311
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,061
[narrated by Red]
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE OUT THERE
DOING A LITTLE BACKPACKING.

312
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,230
I'VE GOT THE TRADITIONAL
SIZED BACKPACK.

313
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,033
BILL'S GOT A LITTLE BIGGER SIZE.

314
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,337
YEAH, THE FOREST IS NOT AS
NARROW AS IT USED TO BE.

315
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:27,106
WE'VE COME TO A DITCH, HERE.

316
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,275
AND THIS IS SOMETHING
I DIDN'T REALIZE.

317
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:31,877
BILL KNOWS THE TECHNIQUE.

318
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,445
HE'S THE EXPERT.

319
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,648
WHAT YOU DO IS THROW IT AND...

320
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,517
BILL'S GONNA THROW HIS.

321
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,286
THAT'S A PRETTY BIG RIG, BILL.

322
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,288
OH, NO!

323
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:45,224
THAT WASN'T A TOTAL SUCCESS.

324
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,259
WHY DON'T WE REVERSE IT, BILL?

325
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:51,931
YOU JUMP ACROSS AND I'LL
THROW YOUR GEAR TO YOU.

326
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,200
AWAY YOU GO.

327
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,769
OOOOH!!!

328
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,771
BILL, THERE'S A POST THERE.

329
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,039
THERE'S YOUR STUFF.

330
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,811
BILL'S FOUND SOMETHING HERE.

331
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,446
OH, I SEE.

332
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,315
OH, BOY!

333
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,150
A SHOPPING CART, EH?

334
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,619
I SEE, BILL'S GONNA
TAKE THE EASY WAY.

335
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:17,156
IT'S A REAL TIME SAVER.

336
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,091
I'M NOT SURE THIS IS CAMPING.

337
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,429
ATTENTION SHOPPERS:
WE'VE GOT A LOOSE ONE HERE.

338
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:29,535
YOU MIGHT WANT TO GO
AROUND THAT, BILL.

339
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:32,004
GO AROUND IT, BILL.

340
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:35,941
JUST GO AROUND IT.

341
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:40,346
OH! OH! OH!

342
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:43,382
OH, THERE SHE GOES.

343
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,084
OW!!!

344
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,391
HE'S MAKING GOOD TIME NOW.

345
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,100
OH! OH! OH!

346
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:05,204
OH, NO!

347
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:08,540
THAT'S SUCH A SHAME.

348
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,476
THERE YOU GO!

349
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:11,944
ALWAYS RETURN YOUR CART.

350
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,615
[crowd noises]

351
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,717
WELCOME TO THE
CANDIDATES DEBATE.

352
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,886
JUST SETTLE
DOWN, PLEASE.

353
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:23,889
THE SOONER WE GET STARTED,
THE SOONER WE'LL FINISH

354
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,825
AND WE CAN GET TO
THE FREE BEER AND
SANDWICHES.

355
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,827
[silence]

356
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:32,898
OKAY.

357
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,935
WELCOME TO THE CANDIDATES DEBATE
FOR THE MAYOR OF POSSUM LAKE.

358
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,703
I'M DALTON HUMPHREY,
YOUR MODERATOR

359
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,706
AND IT IS MY PLEASURE
TO INTRODUCE THE CANDIDATES.

360
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,710
GIVES YOU SOME IDEA HOW LITTLE
PLEASURE THERE IS IN MY LIFE.

361
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,312
NOT THAT I BLAME
ANYONE BUT MYSELF.

362
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,914
I'M THE ONE WHO TOLD MY DAUGHTER
THAT SHE COULD MOVE BACK HOME

363
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,250
AFTER GETTING EXPELLED
FROM MANICURIST COLLEGE.

364
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,918
I JUST NAILED MY
FOOT TO THE FLOOR.

365
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,853
I SHOULD HAVE USED
BETTER JUDGMENT.

366
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,625
SORRY.

367
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:04,163
OUR FIRST MAN UP HAS LIVED
ALL HIS LIFE IN POSSUM LAKE.

368
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:07,900
RED GREEN.

369
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:08,901
THANK-YOU VERY MUCH.

370
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,235
VOTE FOR ME,
IT WILL BE...

371
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,603
AH, RED.

372
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,205
I'LL ASK YOU TO WAIT

373
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,940
UNTIL I'VE INTRODUCED ALL
THE OTHER CANDIDATES.

374
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:18,210
VOTE FOR ME.

375
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,980
THANK-YOU, RED.

376
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:24,183
OUR NEXT CANDIDATE IS
THE INCOMPETENT...

377
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:28,620
THE INCUMBENT...

378
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,889
WHO REWROTE THIS?

379
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:33,592
I TOOK A RUN AT IT.

380
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:37,496
IT'S THE INCUMBENT
WALLY "KICKBACK"...

381
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,732
OH!!!

382
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,267
WALLY KIBLER.

383
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,405
LOOK AT THAT.

384
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:49,808
HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
THE GUTS TO SHOW UP.

385
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:53,212
IT'S NOT LIKE HIM TO MISS
FREE BEER AND SANDWICHES.

386
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:58,384
OUR THIRD CANDIDATE IS
A MAN WHO JUST ANNOUNCED
HIS CANDIDACY AN HOUR AGO:

387
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,819
HAROLD GREEN.

388
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,321
WHAT?

389
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,323
THANK-YOU VERY MUCH.

390
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,958
HEY, WAIT A SEC.

391
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,126
WHAT?

392
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,460
I CAN DO IT.

393
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,795
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS, HAROLD.

394
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,697
WHY?

395
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,332
IF I KNEW YOU
WERE TAKING PART,

396
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:16,335
I NEVER WOULD HAVE TOLD
KIBLER IT WAS CANCELLED.

397
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:20,105
IF YOU PREVENTED ANOTHER
CANDIDATE FROM ATTENDING,

398
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:23,375
I MAY HAVE TO TAKE
DISCIPLINARY ACTION.

399
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:24,543
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

400
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,078
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO?

401
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,614
I'M WITHDRAWING FROM
THE MAYOR RACE, RIGHT NOW.

402
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,749
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THAT FOR?

403
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,684
WELL, I DON'T MIND
MUD-SLINGING STRANGERS,

404
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,653
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE
DOING IT WITH FAMILY.

405
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,090
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE
I KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT YOU.

406
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:41,393
AND HOW LONG COULD I GO
WITHOUT SAYING THE PHRASE:

407
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,729
BED WETTING.

408
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:48,967
[laughter]

409
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:51,403
BESIDES HAROLD,
IF YOU AND I ARE GOING
AFTER THE SAME THING,

410
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,705
THEN I MUST'VE MADE
A HORRIBLE MISTAKE.

411
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,407
SO, I'M TELLING
YOU RIGHT NOW,

412
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:58,043
I'M THROWING ALL MY
SUPPORT BEHIND HAROLD.

413
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,446
WELL, I HOPE YOU
WASHED IT FIRST.

414
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,650
THIS IS A SPECIAL FEATURE
ON THE SHOW CALLED:

415
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,318
"YOU AND YOUR ANIMAL."

416
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:09,555
HOSTED BY LOCAL ANIMAL
CONTROL OFFICER, ED FRID.

417
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,457
WELCOME, ED.

418
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:18,630
[applause]

419
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:21,800
SOME OF OUR VIEWERS
PROBABLY REMEMBER
GARTH HARBLE.

420
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,836
HE WAS ANOTHER ANIMAL
CONTROL OFFICER.

421
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,471
GARTH WORKED WITH YOU?
YEAH.

422
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:28,640
Red:
IS HE STILL THERE?

423
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:31,710
NO.

424
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,847
GOT BITTEN BY A TOAD,
SO HE RETIRED.

425
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:38,283
MEDICAL REASONS, TERRIBLE.

426
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,954
I NEVER THOUGHT A TOAD BITE
WOULD BE THAT SERIOUS.

427
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,056
IT CAN BE.

428
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,892
CAN BE, YEAH.

429
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,827
AND GARTH LOST HIS NERVE.

430
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,496
ONCE YOU LOSE YOUR NERVE
IN THIS BUSINESS,

431
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,431
IT'S OVER, YOU'RE GONE.

432
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:53,765
YOU'RE DEAD, YOU'RE MEAT.

433
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,000
YOU'RE RED MEAT,

434
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,802
YOU'RE DEAD, RED MEAT.

435
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,270
OKAY.

436
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:01,340
SO, WHAT DID YOU
BRING US TODAY?

437
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,609
MUSKRAT.

438
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,145
[laughter]

439
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:08,080
IT'S LIKE A BEAVER,
BUT SMALLER

440
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,515
WITH A SKINNIER TAIL.

441
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,717
AND THE MUSKRAT IS...

442
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:14,153
WELL, IT'S MORE RAT.

443
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,355
UGH!!!

444
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:26,732
[loud laughter]

445
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,434
AND MORE MUSK.

446
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,069
YEAH.

447
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:36,141
[laughter]

448
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,043
HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU.

449
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,780
ED, IS THIS
A GOOD IDEA?

450
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,716
PROBABLY NOT.

451
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,118
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

452
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,886
COME HERE, LITTLE GUY.

453
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,555
[muskrat screeching]

454
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:50,856
NO, NO, NO!

455
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,024
EASY, EASY!!!

456
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,292
I GOT HIM, I GOT HIM.

457
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,794
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

458
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,296
I GOT HIM, I GOT HIM,
I GOT HIM, I GOT HIM.

459
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,464
[muskrat screeching]

460
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,166
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

461
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,768
HE'S OUT THE DOOR.

462
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,636
GO GET HIM.

463
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,139
[laughter]

464
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,340
WHOA!!!

465
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,678
[muskrat screeching]

466
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:13,912
THERE IT GOES!

467
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,889
WELL, THAT'S WHAT A
MUSKRAT LOOKS LIKE.

468
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,992
AND SMELLS LIKE.

469
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,028
AND BITES LIKE.

470
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:32,397
THANK-YOU, ED.

471
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:43,342
IT LOOKS LIKE KIBLER IS GOING
TO WIN THE ELECTION, THERE.

472
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,411
WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL HAROLD GETS
HERE WITH THE FINAL RESULTS.

473
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:55,887
[laughter]

474
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,162
HOW DID IT GO?

475
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:05,897
NOT GREAT.

476
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:07,432
KIBLER GOT RE-ELECTED

477
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:10,168
AND THEY TRIED TO

486
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,986
I'VE GIVEN UP ON BEING MAYOR,

487
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,856
