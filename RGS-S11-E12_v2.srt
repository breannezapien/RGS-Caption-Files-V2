1
00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:03,436
Red Green:
YOU KNOW, THERE'S
BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:06,106
MEN HATING TO
ASK FOR DIRECTIONS.

3
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:08,074
THAT'S NOT
REALLY THE POINT.

4
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:10,910
THE REAL PROBLEM IS
MEN LOVE TO DRIVE.

5
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:12,545
AND IF YOU HAVE
TO ASK FOR DIRECTIONS,

6
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:14,247
THAT MEANS YOU DON'T
KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING,

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,584
AND THAT MEANS THE PASSENGER
SEAT IS IN YOUR NEAR FUTURE.

8
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:19,919
SO WHEN YOU'RE OUT WITH YOUR
WIFE AND YOU LOSE THE ARGUMENT

9
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,588
AS YOU KNOW YOU MUST,

10
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:23,690
AND YOU END UP ASKING
A GUY FOR DIRECTIONS,

11
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:27,460
HERE'S WHAT TO DO TO STOP YOUR
INTEGRITY FROM SHRINKING --

12
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,496
BECAUSE SIZE MATTERS.

13
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:32,799
MAKE A LITTLE SIGN,
HIDE IT UNDER YOUR SLEEVE,

14
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,534
ATTACH A COUPLE OF
SINKERS TO THE EDGE

15
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:37,203
SO IT'LL UNROLL WITHOUT
YOUR WIFE SEEING IT.

16
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,905
AND YOU WANT TO
PICK A MARRIED GUY,

17
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,507
BECAUSE HE'LL UNDERSTAND.

18
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:42,275
OKAY, SO PULL OVER,
TELL HIM WHERE YOU'RE HEADED,

19
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:45,311
AND AS SOON AS YOU ASK HIM
IF YOU'RE GOING IN THE
RIGHT DIRECTION,

20
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,147
SECRETLY RELEASE THE SIGN.

21
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:58,425
[cheers and applause]

22
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:05,865
ALL RIGHT.

23
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:08,068
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

24
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,004
I APPRECIATE THAT.

25
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,106
WELL, IT'S A BIG, BIG WEEK AT
THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

26
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:15,341
WE'VE GOT A HORSESHOE
TOURNAMENT GOING ON.

27
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,044
MIND YOU, I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO FIND MY HORSESHOES.

28
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,180
I FIGURE THEY'LL TURN UP
SOONER OR LATER.

29
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,817
MIKE CAN YOU COME UP
HERE A MINUTE, PLEASE?

30
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,954
UM, I DIDN'T
STEAL IT, MR. GREEN.

31
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:29,989
WHAT?
DIDN'T STEAL WHAT?

32
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:32,859
YOU'LL HAVE TO BE
MORE SPECIFIC.

33
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,128
WELL, I CAN'T SEEM
TO FIND MY HORSESHOES.

34
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:36,629
ARE THEY IN THERE?

35
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,698
[clunking sound]

36
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,900
PROBABLY NOT.

37
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:42,869
I KNOW THE SOUND
OF MY OWN HORSESHOES.

38
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:44,804
CAN I HAVE
THEM BACK, PLEASE?

39
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:50,110
OH! HA-HA!

40
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,846
YOU SHOULDA TOLD ME
YOU PUT 'EM IN THERE.

41
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:54,848
OH, RIGHT, YEAH.
THANK YOU, MIKE.

42
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,749
WHERE'D YOU
GET THAT PEN?

43
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,384
OH, I'VE ALWAYS
HAD THIS PEN.

44
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,953
THAT'S MY
PEN, MIKE.

45
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,055
OH, REALLY?
HAS IT GOT YOUR NAME ON IT?

46
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,723
YEAH.

47
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,459
OH.

48
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,762
YOU KNOW, MIKE, THIS
STICKY FINGERS STUFF

49
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,731
IS GETTIN'
OUTTA HAND.

50
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:14,100
I'M SORRY, MR. GREEN.

51
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,602
I JUST CAN'T HELP MYSELF.

52
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:18,071
ALL MY LIFE I'VE BEEN TAKING
STUFF THAT WASN'T MINE.

53
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:20,406
IT'S JUST BEEN GETTING
WORSE AND WORSE.

54
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,342
BUT DON'T SEND ME BACK
TO PRISON, PLEASE!

55
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,711
PLEASE DON'T SEND ME BACK
TO PRISON, MR. GREEN.

56
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,279
I CAN'T DO IT
ANYMORE, I TELL YOU!

57
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,281
I JUST CAN'T DO IT!

58
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:29,983
MIKE, MIKE, MIKE.

59
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,351
I'M NOT GONNA SEND
YOU BACK TO PRISON.

60
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,119
GREAT.

61
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,555
BUT YOU NEED TO
DO SOMETHING, MIKE.

62
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,790
WHY DON'T YOU GO DOWN AND
SEE YOUR PAROLE OFFICER

63
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,526
AND OFFER TO HELP
HIM OUT, EH?

64
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,261
I THINK YOU'D HAVE A
WHOLE DIFFERENT ATTITUDE

65
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,729
IF YOU WERE LOOKING
AT LAW ENFORCEMENT

66
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:44,063
FROM THE OTHER SIDE.

67
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,732
THAT'S A GREAT
IDEA, MR. GREEN.

68
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:47,901
I'M GONNA GO RIGHT
DOWN THERE AND DO THAT.

69
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,369
CAN I CATCH A
RIDE WITH YOU?

70
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:50,703
SURE.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

71
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,272
I'D BE GLAD TO
DO THAT.

72
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,806
AH, GEEZ,
THANKS, MR. GREEN.

73
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,909
HERE'S THE KEYS
TO YOUR VAN.

74
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,285
IT'S TIME FOR THE
POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

75
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:09,355
[cheers and applause]

76
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,662
TODAY'S WINNER WILL RECEIVE
THREE BOXING LESSONS

77
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,463
FROM TUCKER'S
MANUFACTURING,

78
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,133
THE MAKERS OF THE FINEST
CARDBOARD BOXES.

79
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,470
OKAY, UH, COVER
YOUR EARS, THERE, ED.

80
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:27,373
RED, YOU'VE GOT 30 SECONDS
TO GET ANIMAL CONTROL
OFFICER ED FRID

81
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,142
TO SAY THIS WORD...

82
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:34,747
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

83
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,015
AND GO!

84
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:39,052
OKAY, ED, THIS IS SOMETHING
ALMOST ALL ANIMALS HAVE.

85
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:41,020
SHARP TEETH.

86
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:43,022
OKAY, NO, NO.
THIS IS WHAT ANIMALS USE

87
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,758
TO FIND THEIR WAY BACK TO
SOMEWHERE THEY'VE BEEN BEFORE.

88
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,761
OH! TRAIL OF BLOOD.

89
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,630
NO, NO, NO.
OKAY, OKAY.

90
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,333
THIS IS SOMETHING ANIMALS
HAVE THAT HUMANS DON'T.

91
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,069
UH, ANTLERS?

92
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,306
OKAY, ED, WHY DO
SALMON SWIM UPSTREAM?

93
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,242
PANIC.

94
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,277
YEAH, DID YOU EVER
SEE THEIR EYES?

95
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,716
ED, ED, ED,
THEY'RE NOT AFRAID.

96
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,351
THEY SWIM UP TO
THEIR SPAWNING GROUNDS,

97
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,885
THEY LAY EGGS AND DIE.

98
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,687
NOW, WHAT CHARACTERISTIC
MAKES THEM DO THAT?

99
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,923
STUPIDITY, I GUESS.

100
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,025
UH, RED, YOU GUYS ARE
RUNNIN' SHORT OF TIME.

101
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,527
OKAY, ED, YOU'RE AN
ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER.

102
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,097
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU AND THE ANIMALS?

103
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:26,499
I CAN OUTRUN THEM.

104
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,635
YEAH, BUT THAT'S JUST MY
SURVIVAL INSTINCT.

105
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,436
THERE WE GO!

106
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,105
[cheers and applause]

107
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,847
IF YOU'RE SITTIN' ON
THE DOCK OF THE BAY,

108
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,782
WATCHING THE TIDE ROLL AWAY,

109
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,917
AND YOU DON'T LIVE
ANYWHERE NEAR WATER,

110
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,820
CALL ROTHSCHILD'S SEWAGE
AND SEPTIC SUCKING SERVICES.

111
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:56,629
SEE, IT'S PEOPLE LIKE THAT
THAT HAVE RUINED IT FOR
EVERYBODY.

112
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,831
MY WIFE BERNICE SEES THEM
WITH THE SLIM WAISTLINE

113
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,933
AND THEIR LOW PULSE RATE,
SHE TAKES A LOOK AT ME

114
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,269
AND STARTS GETTING
ALL KINDS OF IDEAS.

115
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,005
SEE TO ME, YOU SHOULD KEEP
YOUR PULSE RATE HIGH, NOT LOW,

116
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,840
BECAUSE EVENTUALLY
IT GOES TO ZERO,

117
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:11,444
AND YOU WANT TO KEEP IT AS FAR
AWAY FROM THAT AS YOU CAN.

118
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,514
SO BERNICE GETS ME ONE OF
THESE TREADMILL MACHINES.

119
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,583
TELLS ME SHE WANTS ME
TO DO THREE MILES A DAY.

120
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:20,987
AT THE SPEED I WALK,
THAT'S A 24-HOUR COMMITMENT.

121
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,588
YOU NEVER GET ANYWHERE.

122
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,357
THE SCENERY
DOESN'T CHANGE.

123
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,326
IT'S USELESS AND BORING.

124
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,629
AND THOSE ARE TWO WORDS THAT
I HEAR ENOUGH OF IN MY LIFE.

125
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:31,497
SO I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

126
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,068
SEE THIS IS
THE KEY RIGHT HERE.

127
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,403
THIS MACHINE RUNS
ON 12 VOLTS DC,

128
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,305
JUST LIKE A CAR.

129
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,641
THAT MEANS YOU DON'T HAVE TO
PLUG IT INTO A HOUSE CURRENT.

130
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:46,412
YOU CAN ACTUALLY RUN THIS ON
A COUPLE OF CAR BATTERIES.

131
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:49,082
NOW, YOU MAY BE A LITTLE BIT
CONFUSED AT THIS POINT.

132
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,217
YOU MIGHT EVEN BE SITTING
THERE WITH YOUR MOUTH
WIDE OPEN,

133
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,519
BEER AND CHIPS ARE
GOING EVERYWHERE.

134
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,788
SO LET ME EXPLAIN
THE MYSTERY TO YOU.

135
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,523
SEE, WHEN THEY BUILD
THESE MACHINES,

136
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,659
THEY GO TO A LOT OF EFFORT
TO MAKE SURE THIS BELT

137
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,527
NEVER TOUCHES THE GROUND.

138
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,530
WELL, THAT'S WHERE THEY
MAKE THE BIG MISTAKE.

139
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:07,033
OKAY, I'VE GOT MY
CAR BATTERIES WIRED IN.

140
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,535
I'VE GOT MY BELT SITTING
FLAT ON THE GROUND.

141
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,938
ALL I GOTTA DO IS PUT MY
FEET ON THE SIDE RAILS HERE,

142
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,906
AND I'M READY TO
START EXERCISING.

143
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:18,778
AH, AH, AH.
WAIT A MINUTE.

144
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,180
LET'S PLAY IT
SAFE FOR A CHANGE.

145
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,586
LET'S PLAY IT
REALLY SAFE.

146
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,330
OKAY, HERE'S THE
BEAUTY OF A DC MOTOR...

147
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,965
TO MAKE THE BELT
GO THE OTHER WAY,

148
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:41,134
ALL I HAD TO DO WAS SWITCH
THE BATTERY TERMINALS.

149
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,736
DON'T YOU WISH
PEOPLE WERE DC?

150
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,772
ALL RIGHT, IT'S TIME
FOR MY THREE-MILE WALK,

151
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:48,040
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

152
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,243
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

153
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,864
DO ANY OF YOU HAVE ANY UGLY
PICTURES OF YOURSELF
SITTING AROUND?

154
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,934
NO?
DIDN'T THINK SO.

155
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:18,204
SEE, WHEN MOST PEOPLE FIND
AN UNFLATTERING PICTURE
OF THEMSELVES,

156
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,772
THEY RIP IT UP AND BURN IT,

157
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,841
THEN GO BURY IT
IN THE BACKYARD.

158
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,609
I THINK THAT'S A BAD IDEA.

159
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,611
I KNOW SOME PEOPLE TAKE A
FAT PICTURE OF THEMSELVES

160
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,547
AND THEY'LL PUT
IT ON THE FRIDGE

161
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,116
AS A DETERRENT TO KEEP
THEM FROM SNACKING.

162
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,784
THAT DOESN'T REALLY WORK.

163
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:34,420
IT ENDS UP AS KIND OF A
TERRITORIAL THING...

164
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:38,524
"THIS FRIDGE AND ITS CONTENTS
ARE THE PROPERTY OF MOOSE."

165
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,395
I TELL YOU WHAT I SUGGEST.

166
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,931
GET THE UGLIEST, FATTEST,
MOST DISGUSTING

167
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:47,099
PICTURE OF YOURSELF
EVER TAKEN,

168
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,368
AND PUT IT IN A NICE
FRAME AND HANG IT

169
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,571
BESIDE A
FULL-LENGTH MIRROR.

170
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,639
MAKE SURE IT'S SUCH
A HORRIBLE PICTURE

171
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:57,543
THERE'S ALMOST NO CHANCE
YOU'RE EVER GONNA LOOK
THAT BAD AGAIN.

172
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,912
THIS MEANS WHEN YOU STAND
IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR,

173
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,215
YOU'RE GONNA SEE THAT
YOU LOOK WAY BETTER NOW

174
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,517
THAN YOU DID BACK WHEN
THAT PICTURE WAS TAKEN.

175
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,586
THEN YOU START THINKING
THAT AS YOU GET OLDER,

176
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,721
YOU START LOOKING BETTER.

177
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,057
AND THAT'LL MAKE
YOU LOOK BETTER STILL.

178
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,226
AND IF THE DAY EVER COMES WHEN
YOU ACTUALLY LOOK WORSE

179
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,827
THAN YOU DO IN THE PICTURE,

180
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:17,864
WELL, HEY, TIME TO
GET OUT THE CAMERA.

181
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:19,699
REMEMBER,
I'M PULLIN' FOR YOU.

182
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,567
WE'RE ALL IN
THIS TOGETHER.

183
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:24,103
[applause]

184
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,340
WELL, THIS IS THE EXPERTS'
PORTION OF THE SHOW,

185
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,075
WHERE WE FEATURE.
THOSE THREE LITTLE WORDS

186
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,676
MEN FIND SO HARD TO SAY...

187
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,913
audience: I DON'T KNOW. 

188
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:37,049
AND TODAY'S LETTER
READS AS FOLLOWS...

189
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:40,219
"DEAR EXPERTS: OUR DAUGHTER'S
ABOUT TO MARRY A MORON."

190
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,255
OH, GEEZ.

191
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,490
"IS THERE ANYTHING
WE CAN DO TO STOP HER?

192
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,726
"IF NOT, HOW DO WE
CARRY ON WITH OUR LIVES

193
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,694
"ONCE WE HAVE AN
IDIOT IN THE FAMILY?"

194
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,765
OKAY, WELL, NOW,
AS A FATHER,

195
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,001
IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
TO POINT OUT THAT

196
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,436
THIS GUY REALLY
IS STUPID,

197
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,739
SO WHAT YOU WANNA
DO IS INVITE HIM OVER

198
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:02,008
FOR THE "TRIVIAL
PURSUIT" GAME.

199
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,809
ONLY INSTEAD OF
A GAME PIECE,

200
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,879
YOU MAKE HIM USE YOUR
DAUGHTER'S ENGAGEMENT RING.

201
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,614
EVERY TIME HE
GETS ONE WRONG,

202
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,017
YOU PRY A DIAMOND
OUTTA THERE.

203
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,185
THAT IS SO WRONG!

204
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,155
A MARRIAGE IS BASED ON
MUTUAL RESPECT, NOT IQ.

205
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:18,491
IF YOU HAVE MUTUAL RESPECT,
YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING ELSE.

206
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,626
HOW MANY YEARS
YOU BEEN MARRIED, HAROLD?

207
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,063
OKAY, I HAVEN'T FOUND
THE RIGHT PERSON YET,

208
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,265
BUT AT LEAST I KNOW
WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR.

209
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,502
YES, UNFORTUNATELY,
SO DO THEY.

210
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,370
EXCEPT FOR THIS
GUY'S DAUGHTER,

211
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,472
WHO THINKS SHE'S LOOKING
FOR A MORON, I GUESS.

212
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,207
YEAH, WELL,
I'M IN THE SAME BOAT.

213
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:38,044
YEAH, MY DAUGHTER'S FIANCé
IS SURE NO BRAINIAC.

214
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,946
IT'S SO DISAPPOINTING
WHEN YOUR DAUGHTER

215
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,315
STARTS GOING OUT
WITH A TOTAL IDIOT.

216
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,150
WELL, BE CAREFUL,
NOW, MR. DALTON.

217
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,818
THEY SAY GIRLS ARE
ATTRACTED TO MEN

218
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,687
WHO REMIND THEM
OF THEIR FATHER.

219
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,591
AH, HAROLD,
COME ON, NOW.

220
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:52,959
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

221
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,661
THE FACT THAT THIS GUY NOTICES
THE BOYFRIEND IS STUPID

222
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,463
MEANS THAT HE'S
PRETTY SMART.

223
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,566
'CAUSE STUPID PEOPLE DON'T
THINK ANYTHING IS STUPID.

224
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,635
WHEREAS YOU THINK
EVERYTHING IS STUPID.

225
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,804
OH, HAROLD, DON'T
BE ST -- STEREOTYPING.

226
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:07,139
DON'T BE
STEREOTYPING ME.

227
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,709
WELL, MY ADVICE TO THIS VIEWER
IS TALK TO ANOTHER COUPLE

228
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,811
WHOSE DAUGHTER
MARRIED AN IDIOT.

229
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,346
BUT THERE WON'T
BE ANYBODY LIKE THAT

230
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,247
UNTIL YOU GET ENGAGED.

231
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,317
I WAS THINKING MORE OF
AUNT BERNICE'S PARENTS.

232
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,586
[Dalton laughing]

233
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:21,921
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

234
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,230
Red: YOU'RE HOME, DALTON.
YOU CAN GET OUT NOW.

235
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,532
Dalton: I CAN'T GET
THE PAINT OFF.

236
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,368
YES!
TRY THE VARSOL?

237
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,937
YES, RED!
GASOLINE?

238
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,239
WELL, THERE'S A
BELT SANDER BACK THERE,

239
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:41,841
BUT NOWHERE TO
PLUG IT IN.

240
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,043
I CAN THINK OF
A PLACE!

241
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,445
NOW, DON'T GET YOURSELF ALL
WRANGED UP HERE, DALTON.

242
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,748
ANN MARIE PROBABLY
WON'T EVEN NOTICE.

243
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:50,716
WON'T EVEN NOTICE?!

244
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,184
LOOK AT ME.

245
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,719
I LOOK LIKE
BOZO THE CLOWN.

246
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,421
WELL, THAT'S NOT
A HUGE STRETCH FOR HER.

247
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,324
I CAN'T GO IN THERE.
ANN MARIE DOES NOT LET
ME GO TO PAINT BALL.

248
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,292
IF SHE SEES THE PAINT
ALL OVER MY FACE,

249
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,262
SHE'LL KNOW I DISOBEYED
A DIRECT ORDER.

250
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,265
ANN MARIE A LITTLE ON THE
MILITANT SIDE, IS SHE?

251
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,702
WE ARE MESSING WITH
THE WRONG MARINE.

252
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,671
WELL, YOU KNOW,
YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN WEARING

253
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,606
ONE OF THOSE
PROTECTIVE MASKS.

254
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,207
YOU KNOW, I WAS,

255
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,143
BUT IT GOT KNOCKED OFF
IN THE FIRST SHOT.

256
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,145
WELL, YOU COULDN'T HAVE
HAD IT ON PROPERLY.

257
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,846
YOU SEE,
THE PROBLEM WAS,

258
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,782
YOU SHOT ME FROM
FOUR FEET AWAY.

259
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,417
OKAY, I PANICKED,
ALL RIGHT?

260
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,185
I SAW THE ENEMY;
I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.

261
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,054
I WAS ON YOUR
TEAM, RED!

262
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,955
WELL, WHO COULD TELL
WITH THAT MASK ON?

263
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,424
ALL RIGHT,
I GOT AN IDEA.

264
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:32,792
I'VE GOT A GALLON
OF PAINT HERE.

265
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,027
TAKE THE LID OFF THERE.
HOLD ONTO THAT, ALL RIGHT?

266
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,929
NOW, YOU TAKE THIS
INTO THE HOUSE,

267
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,864
AND YOU TELL ANN MARIE
YOU WERE GONNA PAINT
THE FRONT HALL,

268
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,701
BUT YOU SLIPPED AND
YOUR FACE WENT RIGHT
INTO THE CAN.

269
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,436
OH, OH,
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

270
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,004
YOU CAN TELL YOU'RE A
MARRIED MAN, HUH?

271
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,672
YEAH.

272
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,408
OH, HEY, NO, NO.
THIS COLOUR WON'T MATCH.

273
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,277
OH, NO PROBLEM.

274
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,382
[applause]

275
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,857
WELL, WE SURE GOT A DIFFERENT
MIKE IN TOWN, I TELL YOU.

276
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,459
HIS PAROLE OFFICER
GAVE HIM A JOB

277
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:10,062
AS ASSISTANT BYLAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.

278
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,864
AND THE CRIME RATE
HAS JUST DROPPED.

279
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,366
THAT'S BECAUSE MIKE IS
TOO BUSY TO STEAL STUFF.

280
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,602
RED! RED!

281
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,471
MIKE IS
OUT OF CONTROL!

282
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,239
YOU GIVE A GUY
A GOOFY UNIFORM,

283
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,274
AND HE SURE THINKS
HE IS SOMETHING.

284
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,177
[laughter]

285
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,949
YOU KNOW, HE NAILED ME
TWICE TODAY FOR PARKING
VIOLATIONS?

286
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,751
I DIDN'T HAVE MY CAR.

287
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,986
I WAS JUST SITTING
ON THE CURB.

288
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,055
THAT'S NOT PARKING.

289
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,991
THAT WOULD BE EITHER
LOITERING OR LITTERING.

290
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,993
OH, RED,
HE'S GONE FANATICAL.

291
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,095
HE JUST SNEAKS UP FROM
BEHIND AND NAILS YOU.

292
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,831
HE'S LIKE A WEDGIE.

293
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,400
COME ON.

294
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,202
JUST GO EASY ON HIM
FOR CRYING OUT --

295
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,904
HE'S TRYING TO
BECOME A BETTER PERSON.

296
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,472
WELL,
IT'S NOT WORKING.

297
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,975
I LIKED HIM MORE WHEN
I COULDN'T TRUST HIM.

298
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,077
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT,
WE'VE GOTTA GIVE HIM A CHANCE.

299
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,945
HE'S GOT A BAD
SELF-IMAGE.

300
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,982
HE SEES HIMSELF AS A LOW-LIFE,
TWO-BIT CRIMINAL.

301
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:05,684
HE IS A LOW-LIFE,
TWO-BIT CRIMINAL!

302
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,654
WELL, I KNOW, BUT WE'RE
GIVING HIM AN OPPORTUNITY
TO BE SOMETHING BETTER.

303
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:12,024
WHAT? A PAIN-IN-THE-BUTT
BYLAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER?

304
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,859
OKAY, OKAY,
MAYBE AT FIRST.

305
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,395
BUT ONCE HE SETTLES INTO
THE JOB AND COOLS OFF
A LITTLE BIT,

306
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,231
THEN WE'LL HAVE A
GUY ON THE INSIDE.

307
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,100
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

308
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,635
WELL,
I'M TELLING YOU.

309
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,503
ONCE HE TRIES ALL THESE
POWERS AND EVERYTHING,

310
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,672
THEN SUDDENLY HE'LL
REMEMBER WHO HIS
FRIENDS ARE,

311
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,040
AND WE'LL BE ABLE TO
DO WHATEVER WE WANT...

312
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,809
WE CAN SPEED; WE CAN PARK
WHEREVER WE FEEL LIKE.

313
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,410
GO THROUGH
RED LIGHTS!

314
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,546
WALK AROUND TOPLESS!

315
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:36,215
[laughter]

316
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,654
Red: HAD A SPECIAL PROJECT. 

317
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,222
INSTEAD OF 
BUILDING SOMETHING 

318
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,790
WE WERE GONNA TEAR 
DOWN THE SHED. 

319
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,458
AND WALTER DROVE 
OVER IN HIS CAR.
 

320
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,327
I JUST FIGURED GET A SLEDGE 
HAMMER AND JUST START
 
WAILING AWAY.

321
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,962
SOMETHING WAS BOUND TO 
GIVE SOONER OR LATER,
 

322
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,597
HOPEFULLY NOT MY OWN BACK. 

323
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,299
BUT WALTER CAME 
AND SAID, NO, NO.
 

324
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,267
HE WANTED TO STOP ME. 
HE HAD A BETTER IDEA.
 
 

325
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,069
HE'S FIGURIN' WE 
COULD USE OUR POLE THERE.   

326
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,171
AND IF WE HOISTED UP, SAY, 
A -- ONE OF THE OIL DRUMS,
 

327
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:00,673
THEY HAVE A LOT OF WEIGHT, 

328
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,441
WE COULD MAKE OUR 
OWN WRECKING BALL.
 

329
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:03,909
ALWAYS WANTED TO 
HAVE A WRECKING BALL.
 

330
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,411
I LIKE THE IDEA OF THAT, 

331
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,046
SO WE TIED HER UP 
TO THE LINE
 

332
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:08,747
AND WE FILLED HER 
WITH ALL THE --
 

333
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,750
BOY, WE'RE SO LUCKY 
HAVING ALL THOSE CAR 
BATTERIES AROUND. 

334
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:13,652
LUCKILY, NONE OF 
THEM WERE TOO JUICED UP,  

335
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,454
AND NEITHER WERE 
WE AT THIS POINT
 

336
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,056
SO WE COULD GET MOST OF 
THEM INTO THE BARREL.
 

337
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,824
SO WE HOISTED 
HER UP ON THE POLE.
 

338
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,160
IT WAS A METAL POLE, 
SO A LOT OF STRENGTH.
 

339
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,995
AND JUST WIND HER UP THERE. 
AND SHE'S READY TO GO.
 

340
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,897
THEN WE JUST TAKE HER BACK, 
SWING HER BACK.
 

341
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,732
THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT. 

342
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:29,668
YOU KNOW, UNFORTUNATELY, 
WE HIT THE POLE. 

343
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,273
ALL RIGHT. 
OKAY. OKAY.
 

344
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,442
OKAY, SO, UH, 
SO NOW WHAT?
 

345
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,310
WELL, WALTER'S 
GOT ANOTHER IDEA.
 

346
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,112
HE SAYS WE'LL JUST LOAD HER 
UP WITH THE BATTERIES AGAIN.
 

347
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,047
AND INSTEAD OF STICKING 
THE POLE BACK IN THE GROUND. 

348
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,950
WHAT WE'LL DO IS 
MOUNT THE WHOLE POLE 

349
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,120
SOMEWHERE ELSE, LIKE, SAY, 
THE POSSUM VAN. 

350
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,222
NOW, HE SAID TO ME, 
'JUST DRIVE HER UP CLOSER
 

351
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,957
'TO THE SHED, 
AND WATCH ME.
 

352
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,592
'I'LL TELL YOU 
WHEN TO STOP.'
 

353
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,394
BUT HE WASN'T LOOKIN', 
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN --
 

354
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,863
I SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES, 
SO IT SWINGS BACK TOWARDS ME.
 

355
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,632
THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH, WALTER. 

356
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,267
WHAT'S YOUR NEXT IDEA? 

357
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,235
SO THEN HE GETS ME 
TO PARK HER SIDEWAYS,
 

358
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,604
PUT THE BATTERIES ALL IN, 
AND AWAY WE GO AGAIN.
 

359
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,007
BUT HE FIGURES MAYBE WE 
CAN JUST HOIST HER UP
 

360
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,075
BY GETTING ON 
A LADDER OR WHATEVER,
 

361
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,677
AND GET ENOUGH 
HEIGHT ON HER
 

362
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,379
THAT WE CAN SWING HER UP. 

363
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,214
WE'RE STILL GONNA TRY TO MAKE 
THIS WRECKING BALL WORK.
 

364
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,049
I THOUGHT THIS WAS 
A LITTLE TOO HIGH,
 

365
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,019
BUT HE SEEMED TO 
FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT.  

366
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,088
YOU KNOW, I THINK THE 
ONE THING WE FORGOT TO DO
 

367
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,457
WAS TO CHECK THE 
KNOT ON THE ROPE.
 

368
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,626
AND, UH -- 

369
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:34,266
SO WALTER TIED A LITTLE 
TOUGHER KNOT THIS TIME.
 

370
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,335
AND NOW WE'RE READY TO GO, 

371
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,170
AND HE WANTS TO 
DO HER AGAIN,
 

372
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,205
SO BACK UP THE 
LADDER HE GOES.
 

373
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,074
UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN YOU 
TIE A BIGGER KNOT,
 

374
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,176
IT USES MORE ROPE. 

375
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,912
SO WHAT HAPPENED HERE 
WAS THAT SHE WAS JUST
 
A LITTLE TOO SHORT

376
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,214
TO ACTUALLY HIT THE SHED, 

377
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,617
SO SHE, UH, SWUNG UP 
IN THE PENDULUM STYLE, 

378
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,652
SO FAMOUS FOR NEWTON.  

379
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,220
AND IT CAME UP. 

380
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,655
THEN IT JUST CAME 
RIGHT BACK.
 

381
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,257
NOW IT'S NAILING WALTER, 

382
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,858
SO I GOTTA MOVE 
HIM AWAY FROM THE SHED.
 

383
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,493
SO I GET HIM INTO THE -- 

384
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,895
AND HE KINDA WENT 
INTO THE TREES THERE.
 

385
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,430
I THINK HE'S ALL RIGHT. 
NO, HE'S GOOD.
 
 

386
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,664
HE'S GOOD. 

387
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,066
HE'S GOOD -- OH! 

388
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,367
AND, UH -- OH! 

389
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:11,270
NO, NO, HE'S FINE. 

390
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:14,506
[applause]

391
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,613
THIS IS THE REPAIR SHOP
PART OF THE SHOW WE CALL,

392
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,483
IF IT AIN'T BROKE,
YOU'RE NOT TRYING.

393
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,752
SO WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
FOR US TODAY, WINSTON?

394
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,520
WELL, RED,
I WAS HOPING

395
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,357
YOU COULD FIX
MY MAILBOX.

396
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,559
BOY, WHAT
HAPPENED THERE?

397
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,595
MY NEIGHBOUR
HAD A SLIGHT

398
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,098
"ALTERCATION" WITH IT.

399
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,333
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
I CAN'T FIX THAT.

400
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,003
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST TRADE
MAILBOXES WITH THE GUY?

401
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,474
WELL, SEE, THAT'S
NOT REALLY AN OPTION.

402
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,712
WELL, WHAT
HAPPENED HERE?

403
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:57,049
WELL, HE CLAIMS THAT I
HIT HIS MAILBOX WITH
MY SEWAGE TRUCK.

404
00:16:57,116 --> 00:17:00,953
AND THAT'S WHEN HE CAME AND
DANCED ALL OVER MY MAILBOX

405
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,055
WITH HIS PERSUADER.

406
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,957
OKAY, BUT THIS
DIDN'T HAPPEN?

407
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,192
NO, I WASN'T EVEN
IN TOWN!

408
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,828
I WAS IN PORT ASBESTOS
FROM THE 12th TO THE 17th

409
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,564
AT THE PRUNE FESTIVAL.

410
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:16,168
YEAH, RED, THOSE FOLKS WERE
GOING DAY AND NIGHT.

411
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,672
BOY, IT'S NOT LIKE YOU
TO BACK DOWN FROM
AN ARGUMENT.

412
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,274
WHAT CONVINCED YOU?

413
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,109
THE GUY'S
6'7", RED.

414
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,611
WELL, THAT
DOESN'T MATTER.

415
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:26,678
RIGHT IS RIGHT.

416
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,280
IF WE CAN PROVE
THAT THIS HAPPENED

417
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:29,948
WHILE YOU WERE AT
THE PRUNE FESTIVAL,

418
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,350
YOU'RE A FREE MAN.

419
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,352
WELL, HOW ARE
YOU GONNA DO THAT?

420
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,854
WELL, THERE'S A
LETTER IN THERE.

421
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,823
IF THE LETTER IS
POSTMARKED AFTER THE 12th,

422
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,658
YOU'RE IN THE CLEAR.

423
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,360
YOU'RE A GENIUS!

424
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,895
OH, NO, WINSTON.

425
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,396
JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE
IS SMARTER THAN YOU

426
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,598
DOESN'T MEAN
THEY'RE A GENIUS.

427
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,867
THERE WE GO.
LOOK AT THE THAT, THE 15th.

428
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,803
I'M IN THE CLEAR!

429
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,337
HEY, DID YOU KNOW THIS GUY
WORKED FOR THE GOVERNMENT?

430
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,039
YEAH. YEAH.

431
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,075
HE'S AN INCOME
TAX AUDITOR.

432
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,810
REALLY?

433
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,478
YOU KNOW, WINSTON,

434
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:01,847
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST BUY
YOURSELF A NEW MAILBOX.

435
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,916
MAYBE I SHOULD BUY
HIM A NEW MAILBOX.

436
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,918
LET'S BOTH BUY HIM
A NEW MAILBOX!

437
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,887
[applause]

438
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,858
YOU KNOW HOW EVERYBODY LIKES
THOSE FANCY NEW TVs,

439
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,394
THEY'RE ABOUT AN INCH THICK
AND THEY HANG ON THE WALL?

440
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,729
THOSE THINGS COST $25,000,

441
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,331
WHICH SEEMS HIGH TO ME

442
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,600
BY ABOUT $24,900.

443
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,402
STILL, THERE IS NOTHING MORE
EMBARRASSING IN LIFE

444
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,704
THAN HAVING AN OLD-FASHIONED
TELEVISION SET.

445
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:29,441
SO HERE'S A CHEAP EASY WAY TO
CONVERT YOUR OLD FLOOR MODEL

446
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:32,211
INTO A STATE-OF-THE-ART
WALL HANGING JOB.

447
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,013
FIRST THING YOU WANNA DO IS
HANG A MIRROR ON YOUR WALL

448
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,349
ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS
THE TELEVISION SCREEN.

449
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:40,185
THEN YOU JUST CUT
A HOLE IN THE FLOOR,

450
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,087
AND DROP YOUR TV
SET DOWN IN THERE

451
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:43,589
WITH THE SCREEN FACING UP.

452
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:46,492
AND THEN YOU PUT A HINGE TRAP
DOOR OVER TOP LIKE THIS ONE.

453
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,260
AND ON THE INSIDE
OF THE TRAP DOOR,

454
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,028
YOU MOUNT ANOTHER MIRROR.

455
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:51,663
NOW, WHEN YOUR
AMISH FRIENDS DROP OVER

456
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,332
FOR AN APPLE OR WHATEVER,

457
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,800
YOU CAN JUST CLOSE
THE TRAP DOOR.

458
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,468
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,

459
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,936
WHEN YOU'RE READY
TO WATCH SOME HI-TECH,

460
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,606
CUTTING EDGE STUFF LIKE
WRESTLING OR TRACTOR PULLS,

461
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,708
YOU JUST TURN
ON THE TV SET.

462
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,443
AND THEN YOU JUST
LINE UP THE MIRRORS.

463
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,078
You know, there's
an expression...

464
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,413
"The apple doesn't fall
too far from the tree."

465
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,282
Okay, in human
terms that means,

466
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,417
"like father, like son."

467
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,419
WELL, I THINK WE
GOT THE PROBLEM

468
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,088
WITH MIKE'S POLICE
JOB ALL SORTED OUT.

469
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,056
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES HE'S
A LITTLE TOO THOROUGH.

470
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,458
SAME WAY WHEN HE
WAS A CROOK.

471
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,826
YOU KNOW, IF HE HAD
A PIECE OF CHAIN,

472
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,128
HE'D STEAL TWO CARS
AND TOW ONE OF THEM.

473
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,898
[laughter]

474
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,903
MR. GREEN, I JUST WANTED
TO SAY, THANKS AGAIN.

475
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:34,206
YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE
FIRST JOB I'VE REALLY
BEEN GOOD AT?

476
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:35,674
YOU KNOW, MIKE,

477
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,509
YOU CAN ACTUALLY
BE TOO GOOD AT A JOB?

478
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,045
I FEEL I'M REALLY MAKING A
DIFFERENCE OUT THERE.

479
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,848
YOU KNOW, I'M MAKING
THE STREETS SAFE FOR
ORDINARY CITIZENS.

480
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:46,318
AND I'M RIDDING THE WORLD
OF HARDENED CRIMINALS.

481
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:53,559
[laughter and applause]

482
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,029
Dalton: THIS IS ALL 
YOUR FAULT, RED. 

483
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,498
YEAH: "WE'LL HAVE A
GUY ON THE INSIDE."

484
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,200
ALL RIGHT, STOP IT.

485
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:04,636
NOW IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TWO GUYS
ON THE INSIDE.

486
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,238
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE, MIKE?

487
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:07,573
THESE ARE YOUR
FRIENDS.

488
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:08,941
THESE AREN'T
CRIMINALS.

489
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:10,876
JAY WALKING IS
A SERIOUS OFFENCE!

490
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,545
YOU CAN'T ARREST
THEM FOR THAT.

491
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,280
WELL, BOY,
MR. GREEN,

492
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:18,550
FIRST YOU SAY ONE THING,
AND THEN YOU SAY ANOTHER
TOTALLY OPPOSITE THING.

493
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,485
IT'S JUST LIKE
WHEN BOTH MY DADS

494
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,288
EXPLAINED THE
FACTS OF LIFE.

495
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:24,823
WELL, OKAY, LOOK,

496
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,091
I MADE A MISTAKE WHEN
I TOLD YOU TO BECOME A COP,

497
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,327
BUT WE GOTTA PUT THINGS
BACK THE WAY THEY WERE,

498
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,028
WHERE EVERYBODY KNEW
WHERE THEY STOOD...

499
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,597
US ON ONE SIDE
OF THE ONE-WAY GLASS,

500
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,899
AND YOU IN
THE LINE-UP.

501
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:36,401
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

502
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:39,471
OKAY, BOYS, ONE OF THESE
KEYS WILL OPEN YOUR LOCKS.

503
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:42,241
WHAT'S THE OTHER ONE?

504
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,276
IT'S A KEY TO
YOUR STORE.

505
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,011
[possum squealing]

506
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,246
MEETING TIME.

507
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,447
COME ON, BOYS.
YOU BETTER MOVE ALONG NOW.

508
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,848
COME ON!
MOVE ALONG!

509
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,383
GET THE LEAD OUT.
COME ON!

510
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,785
COME ON.
MOVE ON!

511
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,487
OKAY, IF MY WIFE
IS WATCHING,

512
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,155
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

513
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:58,724
I THINK IT
WAS ABRAHAM LINCOLN

514
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,359
WHO SAID THE
LAW'S AN ASS.

515
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:01,994
I GUESS HE KNEW MIKE.

516
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,895
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

517
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,998
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND THE
WHOLE GANG AT POSSUM LODGE,

518
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:07,833
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

519
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:11,036
[cheers and applause]

520
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,374
SIT DOWN.
MEETING'S COMING TO ORDER.

521
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,808
Mike: SIT DOWN!

522
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,176
SIT DOWN.

523
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,280
ALL RISE.

524
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,550
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI. 

525
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:28,020
Red: SIT DOWN.

526
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,922
ALL RIGHT, BOW YOUR HEADS
FOR THE MAN'S PRAYER.

527
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:33,492
I'M A MAN, BUT I CAN CHANGE,

528
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:37,629
IF I HAVE TO, I GUESS.

529
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,898
ALL RIGHT, MEN,
I'M VERY PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE

530
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:41,667
THAT MIKE HERE
HAS RESIGNED AS

531
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,002
ASSISTANT BYLAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.

532
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,837
HE'S GOING BACK
TO JUST NORMAL NOW,

533
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:48,407
SO I SUGGEST YOU
ALL CHANGE YOUR LOCKS.

534
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:54,446
