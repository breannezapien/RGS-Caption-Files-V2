1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:04,070
MAN!
YOU KNOW ON COLD
DAYS LIKE THESE

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:06,573
YOU END UP LOOKING AROUND
YOUR HOUSE FOR EAR MUFFS,

3
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,744
THEN YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU RIPPED
'EM IN HALF TO USE AS COASTERS
FOR THE PIANO LEGS?

4
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:12,145
WELL, DON'T PANIC.

5
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:14,714
HERE'S A WAY YOU CAN
MAKE YOUR OWN EAR MUFFS.

6
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:17,050
GET YOURSELF A COUPLE OF
COTTAGE CHEESE CONTAINERS.

7
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:18,785
SEEM TO HAVE A LOT OF
THESE AROUND OUR HOUSE.

8
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:20,854
I DON'T KNOW WHY.
I DON'T EAT COTTAGE CHEESE

9
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:23,323
OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU
SCRAPE OFF A COTTAGE.

10
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,792
THEN WHAT YOU WANNA DO
IS HOOK THESE TOGETHER

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,894
WITH A CROQUET HOOP.

12
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,730
ACTUALLY, JUST LIKE THIS.

13
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:32,465
I SUPPOSE I COULD'VE DONE
THIS WITH A COAT HANGER,

14
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,969
BUT, YOU KNOW, I LIKE TO GO
HIGH END WHENEVER I CAN.

15
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,071
NOW, YOU NEED TO PUT SOMETHING
INSIDE THE CONTAINERS

16
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:39,939
TO KEEP YOUR EARS WARM.

17
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:41,574
HOW ABOUT INSULATION?

18
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:43,743
THERE'S A NO-BRAINER, HUH?

19
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,645
YOU CAN GO R-12 WITH THESE

20
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:47,781
OR R-24.

21
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:49,682
ACTUALLY, IF YOU'RE
FIGHTING MIKE TYSON,

22
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,584
YOU MIGHT WANNA USE STEEL WOOL.

23
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,790
[shouthing]
AND IT'S JUST --
I SAY IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE.

24
00:00:56,856 --> 00:01:00,193
I'LL TELL YOU,
YOUR EARS'LL NEVER BE WARMER.

25
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,662
OR ITCHIER!

26
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,672
[cheering and applause]

27
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,757
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

28
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,659
THANK YOU.
BOY, I DO APPRECIATE THAT,

29
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,260
BUT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,

30
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:36,496
IT'S BEEN KIND OF A ROUGH
DAY AT THE LODGE.

31
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,665
POSSUM VAN BROKE DOWN RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF TOWN,

32
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,701
AND IT WAS RUSH HOUR, SO I HELD
UP TWO OTHER VEHICLES.

33
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,938
I MEAN THE VAN'S A BIT FINICKY,

34
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:46,506
BUT I CAN USUALLY GET HER GOING.

35
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,441
I MEAN, WIGGLE THE IGNITION
WIRES UNDER THE DASH THERE,

36
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:51,044
OR EMPTY A 3 OUGHT 3
INTO THE CARBURATOR.

37
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:53,746
BUT BOY, NOTHING SEEMED
TO WORK ON HER.

38
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,882
WE ENDED UP HAVING TO PUSH THE
VAN ALL THE WAY BACK HERE

39
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,884
TO THE LODGE.

40
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,386
[groaning]

41
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,356
[applause]

42
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,460
YOU KNOW, I WENT TO
SET THE EMERGENCY
BRAKE ON THE VAN,

43
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,195
BUT IT WAS
ALREADY ON.

44
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,631
I WONDER IF THAT'S WHY
THE VAN WAS SO HARD TO PUSH?

45
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:14,300
NO, NO, NO, THE
EMERGENCY DOESN'T
WORK ON THAT THING.

46
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:17,403
I LEAVE IT
ON FOR SHOW.

47
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,606
YOU GUYS LOOK
A LITTLE SORE.
YOU ALL RIGHT?

48
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,474
WELL, WE ARE SORE
'CAUSE, SEE,

49
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,009
WE WERE ON THE
OUTSIDE PUSHING

50
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,512
WHILE YOU WERE ON
THE INSIDE DRIVING.

51
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,013
YEAH,
BUT DON'T FORGET,

52
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,382
THE POWER STEERING
WASN'T WORKING.

53
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,384
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
CALL A TOW TRUCK?

54
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,852
A TOW TRUCK?

55
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,521
THAT'S 100 BUCKS, DALTON.

56
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:37,323
I CAN REPLACE THE VAN FOR 75.

57
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,858
WAIT A MINUTE.

58
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,461
I THINK I SMELL
AN ENTREPRENEURIAL
OPPORTUNITY HERE.

59
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,730
I DON'T LIKE IT
WHEN YOU SMELL THINGS.

60
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,632
NO, WHAT IF THERE
WAS A CHEAPER WAY

61
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,834
FOR PEOPLE TO GET HELP
WITH THEIR VEHICLES?

62
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,602
OH, I KNOW,
LIKE AN AUTO CLUB.

63
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,638
BOY, WE COULD START
OUR OWN AUTO CLUB.

64
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,640
WE COULD GET PEOPLE
TO PAY FIVE BUCKS A MONTH,

65
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,275
AND IF THEY HAD A PROBLEM,
THEY'D CALL US,

66
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,643
AND WE'D COME!

67
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,945
OH, YEAH, 'CAUSE WE'VE
GOT ENOUGH SERVICE
VEHICLES AMONG US.

68
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,580
I MEAN, LOOK AT
MY SEWAGE TRUCK.

69
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:03,449
THAT THING GOES LIKE STINK!

70
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,119
THAT THING IS STINK.

71
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:07,253
YOU KNOW, I GOT THE K-CARS.

72
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,855
I USE THE ARIES
'CAUSE IT'S A WAGON,

73
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:12,358
AND, OF COURSE,
YOU CAN'T TRUST THE RELIANT.

74
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,561
YOU KNOW,
YOU GUYS MAY BE ON
TO SOMETHING HERE.

75
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:15,995
YOU KNOW, I THINK
IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

76
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,764
YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT
JOINING YOURSELF.

77
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,265
YEAH, WELL, YOU GUYS
GET THE VAN RUNNING,

78
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,800
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE FIVE BUCKS.

79
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,468
NO, NO.
NICE TRY.

80
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,970
NICE TRY, RED.

81
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,405
NO, I'M IN THE
SEWAGE BUSINESS.

82
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,106
I TAKE ALL MY MONEY UP FRONT.

83
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:28,675
WELL, NO, I CAN'T PAY YOU
UNTIL YOU GET RUNNING

84
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:31,811
BECAUSE I NEED IT TO
TAKE BACK THE EMPTIES.

85
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,314
[applause]

86
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,320
IT'S TIME TO PLAY THE
POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME.

87
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,356
[cheering and applause]

88
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,496
AND WHAT A GREAT PRIZE.

89
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,732
MIKE, HAVE YOU EVER
WON A TRIP TO FRANCE?

90
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,500
NO, NO, I HAVEN'T!

91
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:55,969
WELL, IF YOU EVER DO,

92
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:59,439
YOU'LL WANT TO TAKE
THIS FRENCH-ENGLISH
DICTIONARY WITH YOU.

93
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:02,942
OKAY, RED, YOU HAVE
30 SECONDS TO GET MIKE HAMAR

94
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,978
TO SAY THIS WORD...

95
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,649
YEAH, ALL RIGHT, ED.

96
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:11,084
ALL RIGHT!

97
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,385
OKAY, AND GO!

98
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,454
OKAY, MIKE, THIS IS
SOMETHING YOU TOOK IN SCHOOL.

99
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,723
UH, BIKES?

100
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,258
WALKMANS?

101
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,492
UH, LUNCH MONEY?
NO.

102
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,827
LUNCHES THEMSELVES?
NO, NO.

103
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,395
CHALK.
MIKE!

104
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,130
TROPHIES.

105
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,431
UH, LIGHT BULBS.

106
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:27,233
OVERHEAD PROJECTORS.
THOSE ARE HEAVY.

107
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,468
NO, NO, MIKE.

108
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,870
NO, OKAY, THIS IS WHY
YOU HAD TO CRAM.

109
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,840
OH, TO GET EVERYTHING
IN MY BACKPACK.

110
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,843
THIS IS SOMETHING YOU HAD TO
PASS TO GET OUT OF SCHOOL.

111
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:39,812
OH, OKAY.
THE HALL MONITOR.

112
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,582
THINK OF A BIG ROOM,
LOTS OF DESKS,

113
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,050
LOTS OF STUDENTS IN THERE.

114
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,052
NOBODY'S ALLOWED TO TALK.

115
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:48,087
DETENTION?

116
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,658
THIS IS A TEST, AND YOU
HAD TO PASS THIS TEST,

117
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,293
OR YOU WOULDN'T GRADUATE.

118
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,795
OH, OH, THE POLYGRAPH!

119
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,265
YOU'RE ALMOST
OUT OF TIME, RED.

120
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:00,800
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL.

121
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,535
HOW DID YOU PASS?

122
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,137
I CHEATED ON EVERY EXAM.

123
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,905
THERE WE GO!
YES! YES!

124
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:08,207
[applause]

125
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,854
HEY, HAROLD!

126
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,056
C'MON, LET'S GO.

127
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,757
WHAT? WHAT? WHAT?

128
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,626
LET'S GO.
WHAT? NO, HEY, NO!

129
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,661
NO I WORK HERE NOW.
THIS IS WHERE I WORK.
I'M WORKING HERE NOW.

130
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:31,864
OH, EVERYBODY'S IN A SUIT HERE.
YOU ALL DRESS THE SAME.

131
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,399
NOBODY'S GONNA NOTICE
THAT ONE SUIT IS GONE.

132
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,034
NOW, COME ON.

133
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,536
WE ARE NOT ALL JUST SUITS.

134
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:37,937
EACH AND EVERY
ONE OF US

135
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,772
IS AN INDEPENDENT
FUNCTIONING INDIVIDUAL.

136
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,474
JUST BECAUSE WE ALL
HAPPEN TO DRESS WELL

137
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,176
AND WORK IN A CORPORATE
ENVIRONMENT

138
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,111
THAT'S SIMILAR TO EVERY
CORPORATE ENVIRO --

139
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,612
WHERE DO YOU WANNA
TAKE ME, ANYWAY?

140
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,114
UP TO THE LODGE, OF COURSE.

141
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,283
OH, NO, NO.
I'M NOT GOING
TO THE LODGE.

142
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,485
WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT
I HAVE TO GO NOW?

143
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,454
WELL, HAROLD, WE'VE COME UP
WITH THIS GREAT IDEA.

144
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,522
EVERYBODY'S ALL FOR IT.
WE'RE READY TO GO.

145
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,224
AND?

146
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,893
HERE, LET ME
TELL YOU.

147
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,462
WE GOT NO
OPPOSITION, HAROLD.

148
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,163
WE'VE GOT NO
DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW.

149
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,733
YOU KNOW HOW YOU USED
TO PLAY DEVIL'S ADVOCATE,

150
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,168
YOU'D PRETEND YOU DIDN'T LIKE
THOSE IDEAS I CAME UP WITH?

151
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,204
I WASN'T PRETENDING.
THEY WERE BAD IDEAS.

152
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,939
THEY WERE ALL BAD.
YOU NEVER HAD A GOOD IDEA.

153
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,307
JUST BAD IDEAS.

154
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,908
WHAT'S THE IDEA
YOU HAVE NOW?

155
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,411
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT TURNING
THE LODGE INTO A PART-TIME
DAYCARE CENTRE

156
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:19,846
FOR PRE-SCHOOLERS.

157
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,647
NO, NO, NO!
SEE, THAT'S A BAD IDEA.

158
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,449
THAT'S BAD ON SO MANY LEVELS.

159
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,017
WELL, THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT,

160
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,686
THIS DISAPPROVAL THING.

161
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,987
WE NEED THIS.
NO, UNCLE RED,
THE LODGE MEMBERS,

162
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,523
THEY'RE INCOMPETENT,
THEY'RE IRRESPONSIBLE,
THEY'RE DANGEROUS.

163
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,291
THEY DON'T KNOW A THING
ABOUT WATCHING OVER
CHILDREN.

164
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,726
THIS IS GREAT.
THIS IS GREAT.

165
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,395
YOU HAVE A REAL KNACK
FOR THIS KIND OF THING.

166
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,296
UNCLE RED, YOU'VE GOTTA
HAVE GOVERNMENT FORMS.

167
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,198
IT'S GOTTA BE LEGAL.
ALL SORTS OF STUFF!

168
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:40,533
JUST COME UP TO
THE LODGE WITH ME,

169
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,235
AND TELL THE GUYS
THIS STUFF, EH?

170
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:43,603
THEY NEED TO HEAR
ALL THIS, HAROLD.

171
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,004
COME ON.
COME ON.

172
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:47,273
DO YOU THINK I'LL
REALLY BE ABLE TO CHANGE
SOMEONE'S POINT OF VIEW?

173
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,709
NO, NO, BUT JUST KNOWING
YOU'RE AGAINST THIS

174
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,545
MAKES US ALL FEEL
SO MUCH BETTER.

175
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:56,282
THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING.

176
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:59,519
[applause]

177
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,194
OH! OH!
RED GREEN.

178
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,595
WELCOME.
YEAH.

179
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,397
YOU ARE
WELCOME HERE, SIR.

180
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,399
LISTEN, CAN I BOUNCE
SOMETHING OFF YOU?

181
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,435
IT'S NOT AN
ANIMAL, IS IT?

182
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:17,570
NO.
PLEASE.

183
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,940
I'M THINKING OF INSTALLING
FIRE ALARMS IN ALL THE TREES.

184
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,608
THAT WAY, IF THERE'S
EVER A FIRE,

185
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:25,778
THE ANIMALS THEMSELVES WOULD
HAVE THE POWER TO SAVE
THEIR OWN HOMES.

186
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:30,550
GORD, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT GOOD TO
SPEND YOUR WHOLE LIFE ALONE.

187
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,319
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

188
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:37,223
I BET THE ANIMALS WOULD
PULL THE ALARM JUST
TO GET ATTENTION.

189
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,926
FIRE OR NO FIRE, I BET YOU
THE SQUIRRELS WOULD PULL IT

190
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:43,029
IF THEY WERE HAVING
TROUBLE FINDING NUTS.

191
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:45,398
YEAH, THEY'RE
SO ANAL, YOU KNOW.

192
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,667
NO, I'M ABANDONING THE
WHOLE FIRE ALARM IDEA.

193
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,268
OKAY, THAT'S
A START.
YEP.

194
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,838
I'M GOING TO GO WITH A
HEAT-ACTIVATED WATER
SPRINKLER SYSTEM.

195
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,272
TOTALLY AUTOMATIC.

196
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,408
THAT WAY THE ANIMALS WOULDN'T
HAVE TO PULL ANYTHING.

197
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:58,478
OKAY, GORD, DO YOU EVER
TAKE A BREAK FROM THIS JOB?

198
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:02,081
VACATION OR A LONG WEEKEND,
HOLIDAY, THAT KINDA THING?

199
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,986
DOES LIGHTNING
TAKE A BREAK, RED?

200
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,422
DOES FIRE TAKE
A HOLIDAY?

201
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:10,857
DO YOU THINK I WANT
TO DO THIS JOB?

202
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,792
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT'S BEEN
SINCE I HAD A PAY CHEQUE?

203
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,060
TAKE A GUESS!

204
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:14,594
I HAVE NO --

205
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,095
TAKE A GUESS!!

206
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,600
SEVEN --
NEVER HAD A PAY CHEQUE!

207
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,401
NEVER, EVER!

208
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,704
THEY GAVE ME THE UNIFORM.

209
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,038
THEY SAID, "HERE, TRY IT
OUT FOR A MONTH."

210
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,341
THEN THEY SAID,
"SEE YOU LATER, BUD."

211
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:29,942
OH, YEAH.

212
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,111
YOU MEAN YOU'VE BEEN WORKING
FOR FREE HERE FOR 18 YEARS?

213
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:33,412
THAT'S RIGHT, RED.

214
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,349
AND WHY DO YOU THINK I
WOULD'VE DONE THAT,
Mr SMARTY PANTS?

215
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,218
LACK OF ALTERN --
BECAUSE I CARE!

216
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,554
BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT
PEOPLE LIKE YOU,

217
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,089
ABOUT THE ANIMALS,

218
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:46,259
ABOUT THOSE THINGS
THAT BURN OUT THERE.

219
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:49,395
I'VE GIVEN MY LIFE
FOR YOUR SAFETY.

220
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,531
AND ALL I ASK FOR IS SOME
LOUSY WATER SPRINKLERS,

221
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,399
AND ALL YOU TELL ME IS NO.

222
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:54,901
NO, NO, NO.

223
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,536
NO, I'M JUST SAYING
THIS IS NOT --
[weeping]

224
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:57,904
GORD, GORD,

225
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,772
I WANT YOU TO COME
BACK WITH ME NOW,

226
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,909
AND I WANT YOU TO BE WITH
PEOPLE FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

227
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,511
NO, I CAN'T, RED.
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T.

228
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,580
IT'S COMING INTO
THE DRY SEASON,

229
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,448
AND I'VE GOT A LOT
OF CANNED CORN LEFT.

230
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,385
ONLY A FEW YEARS LEFT
BEFORE IT'S EXPIRING.

231
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,287
NO, AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE
TO GO WITH YOU, I CAN'T.

232
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:15,821
I CAN'T LEAVE THE TOWER,
NOT FOR ANYTHING.

233
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,590
NOT FOR YOU,
NOT FOR ANYONE.

234
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,959
REALLY? 'CAUSE BERNICE HAS
LINED UP A GIRL SHE'D
LIKE YOU TO MEET.

235
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,561
REALLY?
WHAT'S SHE LIKE?

236
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,296
WELL, SHE'S REAL.
GOOD ENOUGH.

237
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,070
I KNOW IF ANY OF YOU
GUYS ARE LIKE ME,

238
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,805
WHEN YOU WERE A KID,

239
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,807
YOU JUST DREAMED ABOUT DRIVING
A DUMP TRUCK, DIDN'T YOU, EH?

240
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,642
AND A LOT OF YOU GUYS,
AS YOU GOT OLDER,

241
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,344
YOU HAD TO ABANDON YOUR
CHILDHOOD DREAMS,

242
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,379
AND THE REST OF YOU
ARE BACHELORS.

243
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,348
SO I THOUGHT, AS A PUBLIC
SERVICE THIS WEEK,

244
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,350
I WOULD SHOW YOU HOW TO
TURN AN ORDINARY CAR

245
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,485
INTO A DUMP TRUCK.

246
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:49,655
THIS CAR ACTUALLY HAS TWO
THINGS THAT MAKE IT THE
PERFECT DUMP TRUCK...

247
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:53,492
FRONT-WHEEL DRIVE AND
ABSOLUTELY NO RE-SALE VALUE.

248
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,828
I'LL EXPLAIN ABOUT THE
FRONT-WHEEL DRIVE IN A MINUTE,

249
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,331
BUT FIRST OF ALL, I'VE GOT TO
CUSTOMIZE THE BODY A LITTLE BIT.

250
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:19,018
ALL RIGHT, NOW, UH, HERE'S THE
BEAUTY OF THE CREATIVE PROCESS.

251
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,087
I NEED SOMETHING TO
USE AS A DIVIDER

252
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,756
BETWEEN THE DRIVER AND THE LOAD
THAT I'LL BE DUMPING.

253
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,126
NOW, I'M NOT JUST GOING TO HEAD
DOWN TO THE AUTO SUPPLY STORE
WITH A CHEQUEBOOK

254
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:30,229
'CAUSE THE BANK MANAGER WARNED
ME ABOUT DOING THAT AGAIN.

255
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:35,134
NO, I'M GONNA SEARCH FOR
SOMETHING WE CAN USE OUT OF OUR

256
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:38,237
EXISTING INVENTORY,

257
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,873
LIKE, SAY, THIS PERFECTLY
GOOD TRUNK LID.

258
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,146
ALL RIGHT, UH --

259
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:51,250
OKAY, YOU WANNA WEAR THE
WELDING GOGGLES WHEN YOU
DO THAT KIND OF WORK.

260
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,520
BERNICE MUST'VE PUT MINE
SOMEWHERE WHERE I
CAN'T FIND 'EM.

261
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,088
SHE DOESN'T LIKE
ME WELDING,

262
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,357
EVER SINCE WE
LOST THE GARAGE.

263
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:01,627
ANYWAY, NOW WE'RE READY TO
ACTUALLY INSTALL THE
DUMPING MECHANISM,

264
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:05,331
AND FOR THAT, YOU'VE GOTTA PUT
SOME STUFF ON THE FRONT WHEELS.

265
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:09,201
UH, GET YOURSELF A COUPLE
OF EXTRA RIMS LIKE THIS,

266
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:13,839
AND THEN YOU WANNA ATTACH SOME
HEAVY PIPE IN A CRISS-CROSS
ON THE OUTSIDE EDGE.

267
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,941
JUST WELD THAT ON THERE TOO.

268
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,943
SURE WISH I HAD
THOSE GOGGLES.

269
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,417
SEE NOW, THESE SPECIAL WHEELS,

270
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,552
ONCE I LINE THEM UP WITH A
COUPLE OF STEPLADDERS,

271
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,988
THEY BECOME MY
DUMPING MECHANISM.

272
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,656
'CAUSE WHEN I
THROW HER IN DRIVE,

273
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,793
THE SPECIAL WHEELS
CLIMB THE LADDER, SEE?

274
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,961
THAT'S WHY THE CAR HAD TO BE
FRONT-WHEEL DRIVE.

275
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,030
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.

276
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,500
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

277
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,402
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

278
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:44,870
AND NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

279
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,539
IT'S TIME TO DUMP.

280
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,300
I WANNA TALK TO YOU OLDER
GUYS WHO MAYBE FEEL BAD

281
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,335
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF FANCY THINGS,

282
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,804
NO BIG MANSION ON THE HILL;

283
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,307
NO FANCY SIX-FIGURE LUXURY CAR;

284
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,576
NO SHIRTS WITH A COLLAR.

285
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,513
YOU KNOW, WHEN PEOPLE SPEND A
LOT OF MONEY ON SOMETHING,

286
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,316
THEY CALL THAT
CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION.

287
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:31,884
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

288
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,886
FIRST OF ALL, CONSUMPTION,
I BELIEVE, IS A DISEASE

289
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:37,223
THAT TOOK MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER
OUT OF TOWN.

290
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:40,226
AND THE LAST THING I WOULD WANT
TO BE IS CONSPICUOUS.

291
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,194
YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE REASON
I DRESS LIKE THIS

292
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,163
RATHER THAN LIKE LIBERACE.

293
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,000
AND THERE'S OTHER
REASONS TOO.

294
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:51,337
BUT TO ME, THE SIGN OF WEALTH IS
NOT HOW MUCH MONEY YOU SPEND,

295
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,607
IT'S HOW MUCH
MONEY YOU WASTE.

296
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:57,109
BECAUSE, LIKE, A BIG HOUSE
OR A FANCY CAR OR EVEN ART,

297
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,945
WELL, THAT HAS VALUE.
THAT'S WORTH SOMETHING.

298
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:01,447
YOU KNOW, THAT'S
AN INVESTMENT.

299
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,582
THAT'S FOR COWARDS!

300
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,719
YOUR REAL HIGH-ROLLER
BUYS CRAP.

301
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,356
SO WHEN SOMEBODY TELLS
YOU ABOUT SOME GUY

302
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:13,459
WITH A ROLLS ROYCE AND A
12-BEDROOM PALACE, OR SOMETHING,

303
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:16,128
YOU JUST SHOW HIM YOUR GARDEN
WEASEL AND YOUR THIGH-MASTER

304
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:19,131
AND YOUR STAR TREK PLATES.

"I DON'T CARE."

00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,726
HOLY COW, THAT'S A
LOT OF GAS!

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,029
YEAH, THAT COULD
CATCH ON FI --

OKAY, YOU BETTER CALL A
FIRE TRUCK BECAUSE YOU --

WELL, HOW DOES THAT
AFFECT US, DALTON?

WE'RE AN AUTO CLUB.

00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,049
WELL, JUNIOR SAYS IT'S
AN IGNITION PROBLEM.

00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,483
WELL, I'M NOT
GOING OVER THERE.

326
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,886
I'VE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT

FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

327
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,821

[phone ringing]]

335
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,373
THAT'S TOO MANY HOURS
IN TOO MANY DAYS.

336
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,774
AND THEN WE GOT
THE ACTUAL VEHICLES.

00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,247
YOU GOTTA HAVE
A GOOD VEHICLE,

MAINTAIN IT PROPERLY;

341
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:43,849

00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:48,721
EXCUSE ME, Mr GREEN.

345
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,489
SOMEONE'S EXPECTING YOU.

00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,824
WELL, TOUGH BEANS!

347

I'M NOT GONNA LET THEM
RATTLE MY CHAIN.

348
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:56,095
I'M TAKING THE DAY OFF.

349
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,329
OKAY.

350
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:58,597
NO, NO,

351
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:01,100
TELL 'EM I'LL COME
OVER THERE WHEN I'M
GOOD AND READY.

352
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:05,204
AND MEANWHILE, WHY DON'T
THEY GO SUCK EGGS!

353
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:08,007
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

354
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,609
THEY HUNG UP.

355
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,979
DOESN'T IT FEEL GOOD TO
STAND UP FOR YOURSELF
ONCE IN AWHILE?

356
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:16,548
WELL, YOU BETTER ENJOY
IT WHILE YOU CAN.

357
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,350
OH, YEAH?
WHO WAS THAT?

358
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,786
IT WAS YOUR WIFE.
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO PICK
HER UP AT THE GROCERY STORE.

359
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,459
Red: WELL, WE HAD A BIG 
COOKOUT PLANNED OUT
 
BEHIND THE LODGE,

360
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,561
MIKE AND DALTON AND MYSELF. 

361
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:32,031
MAKING A LITTLE 
CAMPFIRE AREA THERE, 

362
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,832
AND WE NEEDED SOME WOOD, 

363
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,368
SO WE HAD A BUNCH OF AXES. 

364
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,736
CAREFUL NOW. 
CAREFUL. 
CAREFUL. 

365
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,371
OH! 

366
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,541
HERE'S A SAFETY -- 

367
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,076
OH. 

368
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,179
NOT SURE WHAT KIND OF WOOD THA 
IS OR WHAT KIND OF AXE THAT IS
 

369
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,948
ALL RIGHT, MIKE, 
YOU GIVE HER A GO. 

370
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,282
STAND BACK, DALTON. 

371
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,917
CAN'T BE TOO 
CAREFUL AROUND MIKE. 

372
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,023
YEAH, IT WENT OVER 
IN THE OTHER AREA.
 

373
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:01,193
LOOK ON THE GROUND. 
IT SHOULD BE --
 

374
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:04,296
THERE IT IS. 

375
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,636
NOT SURE HOW WE'RE GONNA 
GET THAT, UH, TREE DOWN.
 

376
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,838
CAN'T HAVE A FIRE WITHOUT WOOD 

377
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,640
OKAY, DALTON, 
YOU GIVE HER A GO. 

378
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:17,076
HE'S A LITTLE SHAKY. 
DALTON, NO, DON'T! 

379
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,746
OKAY, WELL, THERE'S OUR WOOD. 

380
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:24,149
OKAY, NOW, WE HAD 
ALL THE VEGETABLES,
 

381
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,617
AND MIKE WAS 
BRINGING THE MEAT. 

382
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,323
BOY, THERE'S ENOUGH 
FOR ALL OF US THERE.
 

383
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:34,660
THERE'S NOTHING 
LIKE FRESH PORK, IS THERE? 

384
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,963
WE HAD THE CORN AND THE 
POTATOES AND THE BEANS
 
AND EVERYTHING.

385
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,233
WE'RE WONDERING HOW 
WE'RE GONNA COOK THIS. 

386
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:45,237
YOU GOTTA BE CREATIVE, 
AND THESE WERE CRUHES
 
FROM OUR EARLIER ADVENTURE.

387
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:50,075
YOU STICK THEM IN THE GROUND, 
ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE
 
CAMPFIRE.

388
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:53,245
AND THEN WHAT YOU DO IS YOU RU 
A HOCKEY STICK RIGHT THROUGH -
 

389
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,914
SEE THAT'S -- 

390
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,852
AND THEN TO KEEP HER WARM, 
YOU PUT HER ON TOP, SEE. 

391
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:02,821
SO ALL WE GOTTA DO NOW, OF 
COURSE, IS, UH -- 

392
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,323
WHAT'VE YOU GOT THERE, MIKE? 

393
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,959
AND APPLE FOR US 
FOR THE PIG'S MOUTH. 

394
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,427
OH, OKAY, OKAY, GREAT. 

395
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:09,728
SO WE'RE ALL SET. 
OKAY, MIKE, GOOD IDEA. 

396
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,330
YOU BROUGHT THE PIG, 
SO AWAY YOU GO. 

397
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,798
AWAY YOU GO. 
OH, YEAH. 

398
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,335
WE CAN'T COOK HIM ALIVE, MIKE 
AWAY YOU GO.  

399
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,538
COME ON, AWAY YOU GO. 
GO ON.
 

400
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:22,841
OH, FOR GOSH SAKE. 
ALL RIGHT.  

401
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,178
ALL RIGHT, DALTON, 
YOU GET IT. 

402
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:30,115
COME ON, DALTON, 
JUST GIVE IT A QUICK ONE,   

403
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,650
AND IT'S OVER WITH. 

404
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,085
COME ON. 
AWAY YOU GO. 

405
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,853
COME ON. 
COME ON.

406
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,622
COME ON, YOU CAN DO IT. 
YOU CAN DO IT.
 

407
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,991
OH, FOR GOSH SAKES. 

408
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,193
WHAT? OH, YEAH. 
ALL RIGHT.
 

409
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,463
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. 

410
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,035
BOY, I TELL YOU, 
IT ALL WORKED OUT IN THE END.
 

411
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,171
IT WAS A GREAT DAY, 
AND WHAT A GREAT MEAL WE HAD.
 

412
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,573
JUST SOMETHING ABOUT THE 
COMRADERIE OF THE WHOLE DEAL.
 

413
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,113
EVERYBODY HAD A GOOD MEAL. 

414
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,586
THIS IS THE REPAIR SHOP
PART OF THE SHOW WE CALL,

415
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,189
IF IT AIN'T BROKE,
YOU'RE NOT TRYING.

416
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,425
JOINING ME TODAY
IS DALTON HUMPHREY.

417
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:14,760
WHAT CAN I
DO FOR YOU, DALTON?

418
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,496
WELL, RED, I WAS HOPING
YOU COULD UNJAM THIS
GUM BALL MACHINE.

419
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,798
BOY, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
HAD GUM BALLS AT THE
EVERYTHING STORE.

420
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,067
NO, NO, I DON'T.
NO, THIS IS FROM
THE MALL.

421
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,136
YEP, MY QUARTER
GOT STUCK IN IT.

422
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,409
TRYING TO GET A GUM BALL
OUT, THE MACHINE JAMMED.

423
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,778
NOW I GOT NO GUM BALL;
I GOT NO QUARTER.

424
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,613
WELL, PUT HER UP ON THE BENCH.
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

425
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,417
YOU GOT
YOUR, UH --

426
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:48,494
ALMOST LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT
YOUR THUMB CAUGHT IN
THERE, DALTON.

427
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:51,163
MAYBE.

428
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,432
WELL, I CAN SEE
THE COIN.

429
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:56,702
DON'T YOU JUST WANNA SMASH
IT IN A MILLION PIECES?

430
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,604
THIS MIGHT JUST --

431
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,339
THERE WE GO.
GOT IT.

432
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:03,175
THAT'S NOT A QUARTER.
THAT'S A PENNY!

433
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:09,148
WELL, WILL YOU LOOK
AT THAT, HUH?

434
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:11,350
THAT'S HOW
YOU WRECKED IT.

435
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:14,419
YOU JAMMED A PENNY IN THERE
BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO CHEAP
TO PUT A QUARTER IN.

436
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,921
HOLY MACKEREL.

437
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,222
YOU KNOW WHAT
MUST'VE HAPPENED?

438
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,790
I MUST'VE ACCIDENTALLY
PUT A PENNY IN,

439
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,092
WHEN I WAS GOING
FOR A QUARTER.

440
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,094
OH, OH, YEAH.

441
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,896
HERE'S THE QUARTER
RIGHT HERE.

442
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,031
THAT'S WHAT MUST'VE HAPPENED.
I USED THE WRONG COIN.

443
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,767
I'M GONNA USE IT TO GET
YOUR THUMB OUTTA
THERE, DALTON.

444
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,270
EASY, EASY, YEP.

445
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:34,640
OKAY, YEP, YEP, YEP.

446
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,375
OH, YEAH,
SHE'S WORKING GREAT.

447
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,144
THAT'S MY GUM!

448
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,245
OH, SORRY.

449
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,023
WELL, OKAY.

450
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:54,359
WE'RE HAVING
A DISAGREEMENT ABOUT
THE WHOLE AUTO CLUB.

451
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,062
BOY, THE VAN BREAKS DOWN,
HE CALLS THE AUTO CLUB,

452
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:58,597
WHICH HE'S
THE BOSS OF,

453
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,800
AND THEN HE MAKES US PUSH
THE VAN ALL THE WAY BACK
INTO TOWN AGAIN.

454
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:05,170
WELL, I'M NOT JUST
THE AUTO CLUB PRESIDENT,

455
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,972
I'M ALSO A CLIENT.

456
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:10,676
[laughter and applause]

457
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:16,248
YEAH, BUT THAT'S
THE CUSTOMER TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF THE MERCHANT,

458
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:19,685
WHICH IS A
COMPLETE REVERSAL OF
THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT.

459
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,588
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE
NEED AN AUTO CLUB ANYWAY.

460
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,289
I MEAN, WHEN MY
CAR DOESN'T GO,

461
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,191
I JUST HOT WIRE
ANOTHER ONE.

462
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,626
YES, MIKE,

463
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,329
BUT FOR THOSE OF US
WHO DON'T ENJOY
PRISON FOOD,

464
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,698
I THINK WE MAYBE HAVE TO
COME UP WITH A BETTER
SOLUTION, GUYS.

465
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,633
WELL, I THINK WE SHOULD
JUST ABANDON THE
AUTO CLUB.

466
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,134
OH, NO REFUNDS,
THOUGH.

467
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,536
I'M NOT GIVING PEOPLE
THEIR MONEY BACK.

468
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:38,837
OH, NO, WE'LL
JUST TELL 'EM

469
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,439
TO GET JUMPER CABLES
AND A CAN OF GAS

470
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,140
AND LET 'EM SOLVE THEIR
OWN DARN PROBLEMS.

471
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,575
YEAH, THEY CAN HELP
ONE ANOTHER OUT.

472
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:44,910
EXACTLY.

473
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,278
I MEAN, GEESH,
ON ANY GIVEN DAY,

474
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,846
SURELY THERE'S ONE CAR
AROUND HERE THAT WORKS.

475
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,015
THAT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

476
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:54,686
I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE A WORLD
WHERE PEOPLE HELP ONE ANOTHER
WITHOUT CHARGE OF MONEY?

477
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,689
THAT ONLY HAPPENS
IN DISASTER MOVIES.

478
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,859
WELL, I DON'T THINK
WE COULD MAKE THAT
BIG A DISASTER.

479
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,295
WELL, THE SHOW'S
GETTING THERE.

480
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,097
[possum squealing]

481
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:06,865
OH, MEETING TIME.
LET'S GO, GUYS.

482
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,034
OKAY, YOU GUYS GO --
I'LL BE DOWN IN A SEC.

483
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:11,236
UM, IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

484
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,639
UM, SORRY I DIDN'T PICK YOU UP
AT THE GROCERY STORE THERE.

485
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,508
WE'RE HAVING A PROBLEM
WITH THE PHONES.

486
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:19,177
APPARENTLY THERE'S
A LITTLE PHRASE

487
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,713
THAT'S KIND OF A RANDOM --
JUST COMES ONTO THE LINE.

488
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,483
APPARENTLY -- THEY TELL ME IT'S
THE DIGITAL CONVERGENCE

489
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:27,786
TO AN ANALOGUE SOURCE
ON A ROTARY PHONE,

490
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:30,756
SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT YOU
MIGHT'VE HEARD

491
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,891
WHAT YOU THOUGHT WAS ME SAYING,

492
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,627
"GO SUCK EGGS."

493
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,963
SO -- BUT I --
BUT I'VE LOOKED INTO IT,

494
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,931
AND -- AND I FOUND THE PROBLEM.

495
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,467
AND IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
I PROMISE.

496
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,569
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

497
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,772
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND
THE WHOLE GANG UP HERE
AT POSSUM LODGE,

498
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,440
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

499
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,642
[applause]

500
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:55,714


501
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,149
OKAY, EVERYBODY SIT DOWN.

502
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:58,684
SIT DOWN, GUYS.
COME ON.

503
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,652
SIT DOWN.
EVERYBODY DOWN.

504
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,354
ALL RISE!

505
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:03,989
ALL RISE.

506
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,694
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI. 

507
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:12,130
SIT DOWN.

508
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,800
ALL RIGHT, BOW YOUR HEADS
FOR THE MAN'S PRAYER.

509
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,469
I'M A MAN,
BUT I CAN CHANGE,

510
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:21,406
IF HAVE TO,
I GUESS.

511
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:25,410
BUT IF YOUR TIRE NEEDS A CHANGE,
YOU CAN DO IT YOURSELF.

512
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,279
AMEN!
