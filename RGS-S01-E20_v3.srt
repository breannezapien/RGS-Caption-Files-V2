THEY OFTEN WONDER WHY

103
00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:25,237
IT'S NOT THAT WE LIKE

104
00:03:25,237 --> 00:03:25,972
OLD CLOTHES SO MUCH

105
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,173

YOU KNOW, I MEAN, THIS IS AN OLD

113

CAR, BUT THERE'S STILL SOMETHING

114
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:39,785
ABOUT IT THAT GETS MY HEART

115

POUNDING.

116
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,955
I THINK IT'S THE LACK OF BRAKES.

YOU KNOW, WE ALL GOT TO GO

118

RATHER--I'D RATHER GO WITH

120
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:49,562
SOME KIND OF A HEAD-ON INTO THE

121

GUARDRAIL RATHER THEN SPEND MY

122

DECLINING YEARS IN A RETIREMENT

123

HOME.

124
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,534
I DON'T KNOW HOW I GOT OFF ON

125
00:03:55,534 --> 00:03:56,202
THAT.

126
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:56,869
YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE--

127
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:57,703
I GET STARTED AND THEN I GO OFF

128
00:03:57,703 --> 00:04:00,106
ON A CRAZY ANALOGY AND--AND

129
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:00,906
THAT'S THE WAY I AM WITH THE

130
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:01,574
CAR, TOO.

131
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,908
I GOT THE CAR AND I JUST CAN'T

132
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:03,876
LEAVE WELL ENOUGH ALONE WITH IT.

133
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,212
WHAT I WANTED TO DO TODAY WAS I

134
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:07,680
WANTED TO TURN THIS DOOR AND THE

135
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,948
OTHER DOOR INTO--INTO THE GULL

136
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:09,615
WING.

137
00:04:09,615 --> 00:04:10,616
YOU KNOW THE GULL WING DOOR TYPE

138
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:11,951
OF STYLE, WHICH THEY HAD ON THE

139
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,053
OLD MERCEDES, I BELIEVE, AND

140
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,354
BROOKLYN HAD THE GULL WING AND I

141
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:16,622
THINK--I BELIEVE GULLS HAVE

142
00:04:16,622 --> 00:04:17,389
THEM.

143
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:18,357
I'M NOT SURE ON THAT ONE.

144
00:04:18,357 --> 00:04:19,358
ANYWAY, THE FIRST THING YOU GOT

145
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,627
TO DO IS YOU GOT TO REMOVE THE

146
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:23,262
DOOR, WHICH IS NOT AS EASY AS IT

147
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:25,231
SOUNDS.

148
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,270
UH, ALL RIGHT.

149
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,104
WELL, WHAT I'VE--WHAT I'VE

150
00:04:32,104 --> 00:04:34,340
DONE HERE IS I'VE POKED A LITTLE

151
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,108
HOLE IN THE--IN THE ROOF, BUT

152
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:37,243
I'M GONNA NEED THAT FOR LATER,

153
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:38,110
SO THAT'S--THAT'S ACTUALLY A

154
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,079
TIMESAVER.

155
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:43,916
OKAY.

156
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,353
BY GOLLY, THIS IS REALLY ON--

157
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,321
ON THERE.

158
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,695
AH, THERE IS A BETTER WAY.

159
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,309
OKAY.

160
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:11,443
WHERE THERE'S A VAN, THERE'S A

161
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:12,611
WAY.

162
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:14,680
NOW, ALL I'VE GOT TO DO IS GET

163
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,248
THIS UNIT UP HERE.

164

[groans]

165
00:05:16,915 --> 00:05:18,884
PUT HER ON HERE.

166
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,821
NOW, WHAT I...

167
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:26,191
WHAT I HAVE TO DO IS CREATE

168
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:27,192
A HINGE NOW THROUGH OUR--

169
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:30,429
THROUGH OUR PRE-DRILLED HOLE,

170
00:05:30,429 --> 00:05:31,930
AND I'M GONNA USE A HANDYMAN'S

00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,899
SECRET WEAPON, DUCT TAPE.

172
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,709
AND YOU WANT TO PUT ON TWO OR

173
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:44,843
THREE LAYERS OF DUCT TAPE ON

174
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:46,745
THIS, JUST SO YOU'RE STREET

175
00:05:46,745 --> 00:05:47,413
LEGAL.

176
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:48,213
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T WANT THE

177
00:05:48,213 --> 00:05:49,214
COPS PULLING YOU OVER.

178
00:05:49,214 --> 00:05:50,649
AND YOU WANT IT SECURE THERE,

179
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:51,650
'CAUSE THERE'S NOTHING MORE

180
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:52,718
INCONVENIENT THAN HAVING TO PULL

181
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:53,719
OFF THE HIGHWAY AND GO BACK AND

182
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:55,320
GET YOUR DOOR.

183
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,755
ANYWAY, I THINK THAT'S PRETTY

184
00:05:56,755 --> 00:05:57,423
SECURE THERE.

185
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:58,257
WE'VE GOT ENOUGH TAPE FOR THE

186
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,426
OTHER DOOR, SO NOW I'M GONNA GO

187
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:01,593
AND HOOK UP THE MECHANISM THAT

188
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:02,861
WILL ACTUALLY OPEN THE GULL WING

189
00:06:02,861 --> 00:06:03,529
DOOR.

190
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,497
GETTING EXCITING, ISN'T IT?

191
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,334
AND THERE YOU HAVE IT.

192
00:06:09,334 --> 00:06:10,002
IF THAT DOESN'T SCREAM

193
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,637
"ITALIAN," THEN YOU'RE NOT

194
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,438
LISTENING.

195
00:06:13,438 --> 00:06:14,740
WHAT I DONE WAS I GOT A GARAGE

196
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,108
DOOR--DOOR OPENER THERE.

197
00:06:16,108 --> 00:06:17,543
I GOT IT FROM MY NEIGHBOR'S

198
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,745
PLACE WHILE THEY WERE OUT, AND I

199
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:20,913
RAN THE CHAIN FROM THE DOOR

200
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,114
OPENER--IT'S MOUNTED ON THE--

201
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:23,115
ON THE SEAT, AND I RAN THE CHAIN

202
00:06:23,115 --> 00:06:24,750
UP THROUGH AND HOOK HER ON TO

203
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,418
THE DOOR AND THE DUCT TAPE HERE

204
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:27,986
WILL JUST HOLD HER, AND THEN I

205
00:06:27,986 --> 00:06:29,922
GOT THE WIRELESS REMOTE FOR THE

206
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,190
GARAGE DOOR OPENER, AND I WALK

207
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,291
UP TO MY CAR AND I JUST FEEL

208
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:35,260
LIKE MARCELLO MASTRO--MASTRO--

209
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,229
YOU KNOW.

210
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:38,330
SO ANYWAY, UNTIL NEXT TIME,

211
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,198
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN DON'T

212
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:40,732
FIND YOU HANDSOME, THEY SHOULD

213
00:06:40,732 --> 00:06:42,301
AT LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

214
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:43,635
LET'S GIVE OUR GULL WING DOOR A

215
00:06:43,635 --> 00:06:45,604
SHOT.

216
00:07:05,757 --> 00:07:07,726
[sniffs]

217
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,731
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE

218
00:07:12,731 --> 00:07:14,099
FEATURES AND MORE FROM OUR

219
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:14,766
REGULAR GUESTS.

220
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:15,801
>> AND WILL WE HEAR THE ENDING

221
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:17,703
OF THE WATER TOWER STORY?

222
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:18,970
>> OH, WE MAY NOT HAVE TIME.

223
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,472
>> OH, I'M THE DIRECTOR.

224
00:07:20,472 --> 00:07:22,441
WE'LL FIND TIME.

225
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:38,457
>> IT IS AUTUMN.

226
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:39,825
THE SQUIRREL IS FAT FOR THE

227
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:40,992
COMING WINTER.

228
00:07:40,992 --> 00:07:42,127
THE BEARS ARE PLUMP AS THEY

229
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:43,829
READY FOR HIBERNATION.

230
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:45,397
THE MUSKRAT, THE PORCUPINE, THE

231
00:07:45,397 --> 00:07:47,432
RACCOON ARE ROLY-POLY, TO SEE

232
00:07:47,432 --> 00:07:48,567
THEM THROUGH THEIR LONG WINTER

233
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:49,734
SLEEP.

234
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:51,703
WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?

235
00:07:53,738 --> 00:07:55,474
SO ANYWAY, WE WERE GETTING INTO

236
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:56,975
THIS BUILDING THIS WATER TOWER

237
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:58,310
THING, AND WE DIDN'T WANT TO

238
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,711
MAKE IT OUT OF WOOD OR METAL.

239
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:00,612
WE THOUGHT WE'D JUST GET A

240
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:03,315
GIGANTIC PLASTIC BAG AND STRING

241
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:04,449
IT BETWEEN SOME OF THE TREES AND

242
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:05,617
THEN IT WOULD FUNNEL THE WATER

243
00:08:05,617 --> 00:08:07,252
DOWN TO THE LODGE.

244
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:08,286
OF COURSE THE PROBLEM IS, WHERE

245
00:08:08,286 --> 00:08:10,322
YOU GONNA FIND A PLASTIC BAG 90

246
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:11,790
FEET BY 90 FEET THAT WILL HOLD

247
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,425
15 TONS OF WATER WITHOUT

248
00:08:13,425 --> 00:08:14,826
RIPPING?

249
00:08:14,826 --> 00:08:15,827
NOW LUCKILY MOOSE THOMPSON HAD

250
00:08:15,827 --> 00:08:18,563
ONE IN HIS VAN.

251
00:08:18,563 --> 00:08:19,431
YOU'RE GOING TO INTERRUPT ME,

252
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:20,799
AREN'T YOU?

253
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:21,466
>> NO.

254
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:22,467
I WANT THE PEOPLE TO HEAR THIS

255
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:24,002
STORY, UNCLE RED.

256
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:24,836
>> NO, YOU DON'T.

257
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:26,504
>> YES, I DO, I REALLY DO.

258
00:08:26,504 --> 00:08:27,672
HONEST INJUNS.

259
00:08:27,672 --> 00:08:29,040
STAMP ON IT.

260
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,008
CHERRY ON TOP.

261
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:32,077
SUPERMAN SAYS SO.

262
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:35,847
ON A STACK OF BIBLES.

263
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:36,615
>> YOU THINK THE STORY IS

264
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:37,315
STUPID.

265
00:08:37,315 --> 00:08:38,016
YOU THINK WHAT WE DID WAS

266
00:08:38,016 --> 00:08:38,717
STUPID.

267
00:08:38,717 --> 00:08:40,218
>> THAT'S TRUE.

268
00:08:40,218 --> 00:08:41,086
>> WELL, THEN WHY DO YOU WANT ME

269
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:41,953
TO TELL THE STORY?

270
00:08:41,953 --> 00:08:43,321
>> WELL--WELL, TO BE HONEST

271
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:44,589
WITH YOU, I'VE BEEN GETTING A

272
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:45,991
LOT OF NEGATIVE FEEDBACK FROM

273
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:47,025
OUR VIEWERS.

274
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:48,727
WELL, OKAY, MOSTLY FROM MEN FROM

275
00:08:48,727 --> 00:08:49,961
AROUND HERE, BUT THEY ALWAYS SAY

276
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:51,563
"HOW COME--HOW COME YOU ALWAYS

277
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:52,464
INTERRUPT RED'S STORIES WHEN

278
00:08:52,464 --> 00:08:53,265
HE'S TELLING THE STORY?

279
00:08:53,265 --> 00:08:54,199
HOW COME YOU DO THAT?" AND I'LL

280
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:55,900
SAY, "WELL, BECAUSE, THAT'S

281
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,302
WHY." AND THEY SAY "WELL, LET

282
00:08:57,302 --> 00:08:58,470
HIM FINISH ONE ONE TIME, SEE IF

283
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,304
IT'S GOOD."

284
00:08:59,304 --> 00:09:02,173
I FIGURE, OKAY, YOU FINISH ONE

285
00:09:02,173 --> 00:09:03,642
OF YOUR STORIES AND THEN PEOPLE

286
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:05,610
WILL KNOW WHY I INTERRUPT YOU.

287
00:09:07,646 --> 00:09:08,480
SO YOU GO AHEAD.

288
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,214
YOU GO AHEAD.

289
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:10,048
YOU TELL ONE OF YOUR STORIES

290
00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:10,949
ABOUT WHAT YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS

291
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:11,616
DID.

292
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:12,484
GO AHEAD, RIGHT IN THERE, TELL

293
00:09:12,484 --> 00:09:13,151
THEM.

294
00:09:13,151 --> 00:09:15,120
[laughs]

295
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,204
>> WHAT?

296
00:09:33,204 --> 00:09:35,006
I DIDN'T THROW IT.

297
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:36,040
I DIDN'T EVEN SEE IT.

298
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,242
IT WAS STILL ROLLING.

299
00:09:37,242 --> 00:09:39,377
>> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

300
00:09:39,377 --> 00:09:40,812
>> RACCOONS.

301
00:09:40,812 --> 00:09:42,547
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

302
00:09:42,547 --> 00:09:43,948
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, RED?

303
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:44,749
DO YOU WANT TO PLAY THROUGH?

304
00:09:44,749 --> 00:09:45,517
IS THAT IT?

305
00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:46,551
>> NO, NO, NO, BOB.

306
00:09:46,551 --> 00:09:50,088
I CUT DOWN A TREE AT THE LODGE--

307
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:50,855
>> OH, YEAH.

308
00:09:50,855 --> 00:09:51,689
>> AND HAROLD SAYS THE

309
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:52,924
GOVERNMENT'S GONNA, YOU KNOW,

310
00:09:52,924 --> 00:09:53,825
AUDIT ME OR RIP OUT MY

311
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:55,226
FINGERNAILS, OR SEND ME TO

312
00:09:55,226 --> 00:09:56,327
PRISON OR SOMETHING.

313
00:09:56,327 --> 00:09:57,428
I THOUGHT SINCE YOU'RE WITH THE

314
00:09:57,428 --> 00:09:58,797
NATURAL RESOURCES PEOPLE AND

315
00:09:58,797 --> 00:10:00,265
YOU'RE A LODGE MEMBER, MAYBE YOU

316
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:01,533
COULD KIND OF STRAIGHTEN THINGS

317
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:02,233
OUT FOR ME.

318
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:03,234
>> OH, THAT'S OK.

319
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:04,235
SURE, RED, I'LL DO THAT.

320
00:10:04,235 --> 00:10:04,903
>> GREAT.

321
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:05,904
>> EXCEPT I'M WORKING RIGHT NOW.

322
00:10:05,904 --> 00:10:06,571
>> OH.

323
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:07,405
>> YEAH, THIS IS GOVERNMENT

324
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:08,239
WORK.

325
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:08,907
>> REALLY?

326
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:10,074
>> OH, YEAH.

327
00:10:10,074 --> 00:10:11,576
I'M MARKING TREES.

328
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:12,243
>> OH, REALLY.

329
00:10:12,243 --> 00:10:12,911
>> YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

330
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:13,912
YOU SEE THAT TREE OVER THERE?

331
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:14,746
YOU SEE THAT LITTLE MARK ON

332
00:10:14,746 --> 00:10:15,513
THERE?

333
00:10:15,513 --> 00:10:16,181
SEE THAT?

334
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:16,848
>> OH, YEAH, YEAH.

335
00:10:16,848 --> 00:10:17,682
>> YEAH, I DID THAT.

336
00:10:17,682 --> 00:10:18,349
>> OH.

337
00:10:18,349 --> 00:10:19,517
>> THAT TAKES A LOT OF TIME AND

338
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:20,351
CONCENTRATION.

339
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:21,185
>> YEAH.

340
00:10:21,185 --> 00:10:22,820
>> I FIND GOLF HELPS ME WITH

341
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,922
THAT.

342
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:24,722
YEAH.

343
00:10:24,722 --> 00:10:25,557
>> WELL NOW THE TREE I CUT,

344
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:26,357
IT WAS--IT WAS A BEECH TREE,

345
00:10:26,357 --> 00:10:28,159
BOB, AND I SWEAR IT WAS NO MORE

346
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:30,395
THAN 6 INCHES IN DIAMETER,

347
00:10:30,395 --> 00:10:31,563
AND IT COME DOWN REAL EASY,

348
00:10:31,563 --> 00:10:32,363
YOU KNOW.

349
00:10:32,363 --> 00:10:33,831
>> MM-HMM.

350
00:10:33,831 --> 00:10:35,667
WELL, I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

351
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:36,334
>> OH.

352
00:10:36,334 --> 00:10:37,268
>> NO, YOU KNOW, THE GOVERNMENT,

353
00:10:37,268 --> 00:10:38,269
THEY'RE NOT TOO CONCERNED WITH

354
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:39,637
ONE TREE.

355
00:10:39,637 --> 00:10:40,838
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU FLATTENED A

356
00:10:40,838 --> 00:10:41,940
WHOLE FOREST.

357
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,174
YOU DIDN'T DO THAT, DID YOU?

358
00:10:43,174 --> 00:10:43,841
>> NO, NO.

359
00:10:43,841 --> 00:10:45,510
>> THERE YOU GO.

360
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,511
SEE, THAT'S THE SECRET.

361
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:47,211
>> YEAH.

362
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:47,879
>> MODERATION.

363
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:48,546
>> ALL RIGHT.

364
00:10:48,546 --> 00:10:49,547
>> IT'S MUCH LIKE GOLF.

365
00:10:49,547 --> 00:10:53,051
OH, I PLAY ABOUT, WELL, FOUR OR

366
00:10:53,051 --> 00:10:54,819
FIVE ROUNDS OF GOLF A WEEK.

367
00:10:54,819 --> 00:10:55,987
>> REALLY.

368
00:10:55,987 --> 00:10:57,188
>> WELL, MAYBE--MAYBE ABOUT

369
00:10:57,188 --> 00:10:59,190
EIGHT OR NINE ROUNDS OF GOLF A

370
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,158
WEEK.

371
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:01,025
BUT YOU KNOW, IF I DON'T WATCH

372
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:03,828
IT, I COULD PLAY AS MUCH GOLF AS

373
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:04,896
I WANTED AND IT COULD BECOME A

374
00:11:04,896 --> 00:11:05,563
REAL PROBLEM.

375
00:11:05,563 --> 00:11:06,230
>> SURE.

376
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,765
>> OH, YEAH.

377
00:11:07,765 --> 00:11:11,135
OR IS IT 10 OR 12 ROUNDS?

378
00:11:11,135 --> 00:11:12,770
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

379
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,972
I DON'T KEEP COUNT.

380
00:11:14,972 --> 00:11:16,841
FORE!

381
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:20,044
OH, DAMMIT!

382
00:11:20,044 --> 00:11:21,646
HEAD DOWN.

383
00:11:21,646 --> 00:11:22,313
>> YEAH.

384
00:11:22,313 --> 00:11:23,181
>> THAT'S THE WHOLE THING, YOU

385
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:23,848
KNOW.

386
00:11:23,848 --> 00:11:24,515
HEAD DOWN.

387
00:11:24,515 --> 00:11:26,651
THIS THING, DOWN.

388
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:27,618
IT'S ALL PART OF THE GAME, YOU

389
00:11:27,618 --> 00:11:28,286
KNOW.

390
00:11:28,286 --> 00:11:29,087
>> YOU WENT RIGHT INTO THE--

391
00:11:29,087 --> 00:11:29,887
RIGHT INTO THE WATER THERE.

392
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:30,555
DID YOU SEE THAT?

393
00:11:30,555 --> 00:11:31,222
>> NO.

394
00:11:31,222 --> 00:11:31,889
>> YEAH.

395
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:32,557
>> AH, GEEZ.

396
00:11:32,557 --> 00:11:33,224
>> IS THAT GOOD?

397
00:11:33,224 --> 00:11:35,226
>> NO, NO, IT'S NOT GOOD.

398
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:36,461
WELL, IT'S GOOD FOR THE BALLS.

399
00:11:36,461 --> 00:11:37,462
IT'LL WASH THEM OFF,

400
00:11:37,462 --> 00:11:39,497
BUT IT'S HEAD DOWN.

401
00:11:39,497 --> 00:11:40,364
THAT'S THE WHOLE THING, YOU

402
00:11:40,364 --> 00:11:41,032
KNOW.

403
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:43,401
GOT TO KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN.

404
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:45,036
THAT'S IMPORTANT.

405
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:46,204
GOT TO DO SOME GOVERNMENT WORK.

406
00:11:46,204 --> 00:11:47,538
>> OH.

407
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:48,339
>> I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

408
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:49,040
>> NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

409
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,707
>> HEAD DOWN.

410
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:50,374
>> ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

411
00:11:50,374 --> 00:11:51,375
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, PAL?

412
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,043
>> HUH?

413
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:52,710
OH, I'M FINE.

414
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,377
NO PROBLEM.

415
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:54,045
HEAD DOWN.

416
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:55,446
>> SEEM A LITTLE BIT UPSET

417
00:11:55,446 --> 00:11:56,481
THERE.

418
00:11:56,481 --> 00:11:57,148
>> NO.

419
00:11:57,148 --> 00:11:57,815
YOU KIDDING?

420
00:11:57,815 --> 00:11:58,482
>> NO.

421
00:11:58,482 --> 00:11:59,483
>> HEAD DOWN.

422
00:11:59,483 --> 00:12:00,151
>> BOB.

423
00:12:00,151 --> 00:12:00,818
>> HEAD DOWN.

424
00:12:00,818 --> 00:12:01,485
>> BOB.

425
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:02,153
>> DOWN.

426
00:12:02,153 --> 00:12:02,820
DOWN.

427
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,487
HEAD DOWN.

428
00:12:03,487 --> 00:12:04,155
HEAD DOWN.

429
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:04,822
>> BOB.

430
00:12:04,822 --> 00:12:05,489
>> HEAD DOWN!

431
00:12:05,489 --> 00:12:06,324
>> BOB.

432
00:12:06,324 --> 00:12:08,693
BOB.

433
00:12:08,693 --> 00:12:09,994
FLIES IN THE SUGAR BOWL

434
00:12:09,994 --> 00:12:11,229
TWO BY TWO

435
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:13,798
WHAT AN UNUSUAL THING TO DO

436
00:12:13,798 --> 00:12:14,498
NOT THE FLIES

437
00:12:14,498 --> 00:12:16,133
BUT THE TWO BY TWO

438
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:17,335
YOU DON'T OFTEN SEE

439
00:12:17,335 --> 00:12:19,303
INSECT'S INFORMATION

440
00:12:23,908 --> 00:12:24,842
>> [laughs]

441
00:12:24,842 --> 00:12:25,810
UNCLE RED, W-WE'VE GOT SOME FUN

442
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:26,611
LETTERS TODAY.

443
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:27,612
THIS ONE'S GREAT.

444
00:12:27,612 --> 00:12:28,446
THIS IS A FROM A VIEWER,

445
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:29,680
I THINK--I THINK HE'S A REAL

446
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,748
KIDDER, YOU KNOW, MORE LIKE A

447
00:12:30,748 --> 00:12:31,549
TEASER.

448
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:32,216
[laughs]

449
00:12:32,216 --> 00:12:33,150
>> JUST READ THE LETTER, HAROLD,

450
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:33,818
ALL RIGHT?

451
00:12:33,818 --> 00:12:36,153
>> I WAS BORN READY.

452
00:12:36,153 --> 00:12:37,888
"DEAR RED, ARE THERE ANY

453
00:12:37,888 --> 00:12:38,956
EXPLOSIVES THAT CAN BE MADE FROM

454
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:40,024
A CAKE MIX?

455
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:41,492
THIS IS FOR A SURPRISE PARTY, SO

456
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:43,394
PLEASE REFER TO ME BY THE NAME

457
00:12:43,394 --> 00:12:44,795
'RALPH' RATHER THAN MY REAL

458
00:12:44,795 --> 00:12:46,163
NAME, WHICH IS ALSO 'RALPH,'

459
00:12:46,163 --> 00:12:48,899
BUT SPELLED WITH AN 'F.'"

460
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,601
>> WELL HAROLD, AS THE

461
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:51,936
PROCTOLOGIST SAID TO THE JOCKEY,

462
00:12:51,936 --> 00:12:53,137
"WE'RE GETTING INTO A SENSITIVE

463
00:12:53,137 --> 00:12:55,072
AREA HERE."

464
00:12:55,072 --> 00:12:56,407
I'M REALLY KIND OF RELUCTANT

465
00:12:56,407 --> 00:12:58,676
TO TALK ABOUT EXPLOSIVES

466
00:12:58,676 --> 00:13:00,011
ON THE AIR, YOU KNOW.

467
00:13:00,011 --> 00:13:01,012
>> NO, UNCLE RED, I DON'T THINK

468
00:13:01,012 --> 00:13:02,013
THE VIEWER MEANT IT THAT WAY.

469
00:13:02,013 --> 00:13:02,947
HE JUST WANTS AN EXPLOSIVE

470
00:13:02,947 --> 00:13:04,448
EFFECT FROM HIS CAKE, YOU KNOW?

471
00:13:04,448 --> 00:13:05,750
SOMETHING THAT HE JUST WON'T

472
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,184
HAVE TO STIR NITROGLYCERIN IN

473
00:13:07,184 --> 00:13:07,918
WITH HIS RECIPE.

474
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:08,586
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

475
00:13:08,586 --> 00:13:10,287
AT LEAST THAT'S HOW I READ IT.

476
00:13:10,287 --> 00:13:11,655
>> WELL, YEAH, OKAY, HAROLD, BUT

477
00:13:11,655 --> 00:13:12,590
YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF

478
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,891
EXPLOSIVES THAT CAN BE MADE WITH

479
00:13:13,891 --> 00:13:14,759
THINGS YOU FIND RIGHT IN YOUR

480
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:15,659
KITCHEN.

481
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:16,660
>> OUR KITCHEN OR ANYBODY'S

482
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,328
KITCHEN?

483
00:13:17,328 --> 00:13:18,496
>> NO, I MEAN ANYBODY'S KITCHEN.

484
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:19,597
>> OH, YEAH?

485
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:20,698
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

486
00:13:20,698 --> 00:13:21,365
>> OH, YEAH.

487
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:22,266
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF, YOU KNOW,

488
00:13:22,266 --> 00:13:24,068
MIXING THE VARIOUS BAKING GOODS

489
00:13:24,068 --> 00:13:25,669
IN A CERTAIN PROPORTION.

490
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:27,204
I'VE SEEN A BRAN MUFFIN TAKE OUT

491
00:13:27,204 --> 00:13:29,306
A WHOLE SEPTIC SYSTEM.

492
00:13:29,306 --> 00:13:30,574
>> [laughs]

493
00:13:30,574 --> 00:13:31,642
WELL MAYBE WE SHOULD ANSWER THIS

494
00:13:31,642 --> 00:13:33,244
VIEWER BY MAIL, 'CAUSE WE DON'T

495
00:13:33,244 --> 00:13:34,445
WANT THIS INFORMATION GETTING

496
00:13:34,445 --> 00:13:36,213
INTO THE WRONG HANDS, YOU KNOW,

497
00:13:36,213 --> 00:13:38,149
LIKE A TERRORIST BAKER OR

498
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:40,050
SOMETHING.

499
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:40,885
>> MAYBE WHAT I SHOULD I DO IS

500
00:13:40,885 --> 00:13:43,187
JUST INVITE HIM UP HERE AND GET

501
00:13:43,187 --> 00:13:45,389
OLD MAN SEDGEWICK TO SHOW HIM.

502
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:46,390
HE MAKES A BIRTHDAY CAKE THAT

503
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,792
BLOWS OUT ITS OWN CANDLES.

504
00:13:48,792 --> 00:13:49,493
>> THAT'S GREAT.

505
00:13:49,493 --> 00:13:50,861
WOULD HE CHARGE THE VIEWER FOR

506
00:13:50,861 --> 00:13:51,529
THAT?

507
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:52,396
I WOULDN'T IMAGINE IT WOULD BE

508
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:53,831
TOO EXPENSIVE OR NOTHING.

509
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:55,399
>> NO.

510
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,133
MIGHT COST HIM A COUPLE OF

511
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:57,134
EYEBROWS.

512
00:13:57,134 --> 00:13:59,103
>> THAT'S NOT BAD.

513
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:03,541
>> BEAUTIFUL DAY UP AT THE LODGE

514
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,176
AND BILL AND I THOUGHT WE'D DO A

515
00:14:06,176 --> 00:14:07,545
LITTLE FISHING.

516
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:10,347
OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OOH, OH,

517
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:12,216
OH.

518
00:14:12,216 --> 00:14:13,984
ANYWAY, BILL HAD GOT A NEW, ONE

519
00:14:13,984 --> 00:14:15,552
OF THESE, WHAT THEY CALL THEM?

520
00:14:15,552 --> 00:14:17,321
TROLLING MOTOR.

521
00:14:17,321 --> 00:14:18,889
JUST A SMALL LITTLE THING, BUT,

522
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:20,424
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE KIND OF FUN

523
00:14:20,424 --> 00:14:21,358
AND THEY'RE--THEY'RE IDEAL FOR

524
00:14:21,358 --> 00:14:22,493
TROLLING, WHICH IS WHY THEY'RE

525
00:14:22,493 --> 00:14:24,194
CALLED A TROLLING MOTOR.

526
00:14:24,194 --> 00:14:25,396
BILL TURNED IT ON, SHOW ME HOW

527
00:14:25,396 --> 00:14:27,331
IT WORKED, AND BY GOLLY, YOU

528
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:28,299
KNOW, THEY HAVE A LOT OF TORQUE

529
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:28,966
TO THEM.

530
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:29,633
A LOT OF POWER.

531
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:30,634
LOOK OUT, LOOK OUT, LOOK OUT,

532
00:14:30,634 --> 00:14:32,403
LOOK OUT, LOOK OUT--OH.

533
00:14:32,403 --> 00:14:33,771
I, YEAH, YEAH, HE GOT LUCKY

534
00:14:33,771 --> 00:14:34,938
THERE.

535
00:14:34,938 --> 00:14:36,507
HE'S OKAY.

536
00:14:36,507 --> 00:14:37,775
SO THE FIRST THING HE WANTED TO

537
00:14:37,775 --> 00:14:40,711
DO WAS TAKE OFF THE OUTBOARD.

538
00:14:40,711 --> 00:14:42,346
YOU DON'T NEED THAT, 'CAUSE

539
00:14:42,346 --> 00:14:43,881
BELIEVE OR NOT, THAT LITTLE

540
00:14:43,881 --> 00:14:45,382
TROLLING MOTOR WILL DO ALMOST

541
00:14:45,382 --> 00:14:46,283
THE SAME JOB.

542
00:14:46,283 --> 00:14:48,252
THAT--THAT--THE COVER'S LOOSE.

543
00:14:50,988 --> 00:14:52,423
OH, WELL.

544
00:14:52,423 --> 00:14:53,757
THAT WAS MOOSE THOMPSON'S MOTOR

545
00:14:53,757 --> 00:14:54,958
ANYHOW.

546
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,627
SO BILL HOOKS HER ON THERE AND

547
00:14:56,627 --> 00:14:58,395
HE TOLD ME TO BRING HIM

548
00:14:58,395 --> 00:14:59,763
HALF-DOZEN OR EIGHT OR NINE

549
00:14:59,763 --> 00:15:01,231
FISHING POLES, AND HE HAD THESE

550
00:15:01,231 --> 00:15:03,400
C-CLAMPS, AND HE SAYS "START

551
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,835
C-CLAMPING THE FISHING POLES TO

552
00:15:04,835 --> 00:15:05,936
THE SIDE OF THE BOAT."

553
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:07,204
AND HE HAD SOME, NOT ONLY DUCT

554
00:15:07,204 --> 00:15:08,572
TAPE, BUT THE BLACK DUCT TAPE,

555
00:15:08,572 --> 00:15:10,040
WHICH IS THE BIG DOLLAR--

556
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,575
WENT THE BIG DOLLAR ON THIS,

557
00:15:11,575 --> 00:15:13,277
AND HE DECIDED

558
00:15:13,277 --> 00:15:14,445
THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO FISH.

559
00:15:14,445 --> 00:15:18,415
YOU GOT BASICALLY TEN, 11, 12--

560
00:15:18,415 --> 00:15:20,717
QUITE A FEW RODS IN THE WATER,

561
00:15:20,717 --> 00:15:21,652
AND NOW WE'RE JUST GOING

562
00:15:21,652 --> 00:15:23,020
ON THE--ON THE TROLLING MOTOR,

563
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,755
AND SEE, THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

564
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:25,989
IT'S GOT THE POWER TO PULL US

565
00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:28,325
ALONG THERE, AND BEAUTIFUL DAY.

566
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:30,994
BEAUTIFUL DAY.

567
00:15:30,994 --> 00:15:31,962
STILL A BEAUTIFUL--HAVEN'T

568
00:15:31,962 --> 00:15:34,131
CAUGHT ANYTHING YET--BUT BILL,

569
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:35,799
WAIT, BILL, BILL, BILL.

570
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:36,500
YOU GOT ONE THERE.

571
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,201
BILL, YOU GOT ONE.

572
00:15:37,201 --> 00:15:38,735
YOU GOT ONE, BILL.

573
00:15:38,735 --> 00:15:40,304
AND, IT STARTED, YOU KNOW, THIS

574
00:15:40,304 --> 00:15:41,438
IS THE BAD THING ABOUT HAVING

575
00:15:41,438 --> 00:15:43,340
ALL THE FISHING RODS, WELL,

576
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,943
AND I HADN'T--HONESTLY HADN'T

577
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:47,311
NOTICED THAT HE--WHAT I SHOULD

578
00:15:47,311 --> 00:15:49,613
HAVE DONE PROBABLY THERE WAS I

579
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:50,614
PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE TURNED OFF

580
00:15:50,614 --> 00:15:51,882
THE--TURNED OFF THE TROLLING

581
00:15:51,882 --> 00:15:53,550
MOTOR OR MAYBE UNCLIPPED

582
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,218
THE BATTERY.

583
00:15:54,218 --> 00:15:56,286
BUT IT JUST DIDN'T--DIDN'T OCCUR

584
00:15:56,286 --> 00:15:57,087
TO ME THAT THE FISH WOULD BE

585
00:15:57,087 --> 00:15:58,722
ABLE TO PULL BILL QUITE THAT

586
00:15:58,722 --> 00:15:59,756
HARD.

587
00:15:59,756 --> 00:16:01,425
>> [yelling]

588
00:16:01,425 --> 00:16:04,261
>> BUT IT DID.

589
00:16:04,261 --> 00:16:06,263
ANYWAY, HE WAS OKAY, FLOATING--

590
00:16:06,263 --> 00:16:07,097
ALL OF A SUDDEN HE STARTING

591
00:16:07,097 --> 00:16:07,764
GETTING PULLED.

592
00:16:07,764 --> 00:16:08,765
WE COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS

593
00:16:08,765 --> 00:16:11,134
GOING ON, AND THEN HE REALIZED

594
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:12,402
THAT ALL HIS FISH HOOKS HAD

595
00:16:12,402 --> 00:16:14,071
GOT HIM.

596
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:15,706
SO I JUST TOOK OUT THE PROP OUT

597
00:16:15,706 --> 00:16:17,107
OF THE WATER AND THAT STOPPED

598
00:16:17,107 --> 00:16:20,110
THE PULL, AND HE WAS OKAY.

599
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,511
SO WE GOT--GOT OVER THAT

600
00:16:21,511 --> 00:16:23,513
EMERGENCY AND THEN UNFORTUNATELY

601
00:16:23,513 --> 00:16:25,315
ALL THE LINES WOUND AROUND THE

602
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:26,750
PROP AND STARTED TO--

603
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,617
>> [yelling]

604
00:16:27,617 --> 00:16:29,252
>> YANKING ON HIM, AND IT WAS--

605
00:16:29,252 --> 00:16:30,253
I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA, YOU

606
00:16:30,253 --> 00:16:31,088
KNOW, REALLY--

607
00:16:31,088 --> 00:16:32,089
SO I TRIED TO UNHOOK--AND HE'S

608
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:33,623
GETTING THE PROP--AND HE'S--

609
00:16:33,623 --> 00:16:35,625
IN HIS FACE, AND WORSE AND--

610
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,328
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THEN I GOT

611
00:16:38,328 --> 00:16:40,831
IT OFF AND HE WAS FINE SO I JUST

612
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:42,199
HAD TO CUT THE WIRE AND LET HIM

613
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:44,801
GO.

614
00:16:44,801 --> 00:16:46,770
BEAUTIFUL DAY.

615
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:51,408
IT IS SUMMER.

616
00:16:51,408 --> 00:16:53,477
NINE NUTBALLS RACE UP THE LAKE

617
00:16:53,477 --> 00:16:55,112
ON THOSE NOISY BOATS THAT LOOK

618
00:16:55,112 --> 00:16:57,114
LIKE SNOWMOBILES.

619
00:16:57,114 --> 00:16:58,248
WHAT DO THEY CALL THEM?

620
00:16:58,248 --> 00:16:59,783
SEA MOBILES?

621
00:16:59,783 --> 00:17:00,484
WATER SLEDS?

622
00:17:00,484 --> 00:17:01,585
SURF SKIS?

623
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:03,220
WHAT ARE THEY CALLED?

624
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,387
THEY NEED TO KNOW FOR THE

625
00:17:04,387 --> 00:17:06,356
CORONER'S REPORT.

626
00:17:15,031 --> 00:17:15,932
YOU'RE KIDDING ME, AREN'T YOU

627
00:17:15,932 --> 00:17:16,833
HAROLD?

628
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:17,834
INFLATABLE SHOES?

629
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:18,668
>> YEAH.

630
00:17:18,668 --> 00:17:20,070
THEY'RE CALLED "PUMPS."

631
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,838
YOU GOT TO--YOU PUMP THEM UP.

632
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:22,706
THEY'RE LIKE--THEY'RE LIKE

633
00:17:22,706 --> 00:17:23,940
SNEAKERS OR RUNNING SHOES, YOU

634
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,608
KNOW?

635
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:25,609
THEY'RE FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO

636
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:26,676
PLAY SPORTS OR, YOU KNOW, JUST

637
00:17:26,676 --> 00:17:27,477
PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO LOOK LIKE

638
00:17:27,477 --> 00:17:29,146
THEY PLAY SPORTS.

639
00:17:29,146 --> 00:17:30,413
YOU PUMP 'EM UP.

640
00:17:30,413 --> 00:17:31,348
THEY DON'T GET REAL BIG OR

641
00:17:31,348 --> 00:17:32,215
SOMETHING, UNCLE RED.

642
00:17:32,215 --> 00:17:33,517
THEY'RE NOT LIKE AIR MATTRESSES.

643
00:17:33,517 --> 00:17:35,218
THEY JUST ENSURE A PROPER,

644
00:17:35,218 --> 00:17:36,887
SNUG FIT.

645
00:17:36,887 --> 00:17:37,754
>> WELL, WHY DON'T YOU JUST BUY

646
00:17:37,754 --> 00:17:38,522
THE RIGHT SIZE IN THE FIRST

647
00:17:38,522 --> 00:17:40,457
PLACE?

648
00:17:40,457 --> 00:17:41,958
>> I DON'T KNOW, YOU COULD--

649
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,393
YOU SEE, YOU COULD DO THAT BUT

650
00:17:43,393 --> 00:17:44,394
WHERE'S THE MARKETING SCHEME IN

651
00:17:44,394 --> 00:17:45,362
THAT, YOU SEE?

652
00:17:45,362 --> 00:17:46,997
I MEAN, WHEREAS WITH THESE,

653
00:17:46,997 --> 00:17:47,998
"THE PUMP."

654
00:17:47,998 --> 00:17:48,665
YOU SEE?

655
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:49,499
IT'S JUST SOMETHING NEW.

656
00:17:49,499 --> 00:17:50,233
IT'S JUST SOMETHING NEW.

657
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:51,234
THAT'S ALL IT IS.

658
00:17:51,234 --> 00:17:52,602
AND YOU KNOW, THEY COST TWICE AS

659
00:17:52,602 --> 00:17:53,637
MUCH AS REGULAR SHOES.

660
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:54,704
>> TWICE AS MUCH?

661
00:17:54,704 --> 00:17:55,505
>> OH, YEAH.

662
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:56,239
>> HOW COME?

663
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:57,807
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, INFLATION.

664
00:17:57,807 --> 00:18:00,777
[laughing]

665
00:18:00,777 --> 00:18:02,112
>> WE'RE GONNA COME RIGHT BACK

666
00:18:02,112 --> 00:18:03,613
AND FINISH OFF THE SHOW WITH A

667
00:18:03,613 --> 00:18:04,814
LOT OF SPECIAL STUFF, SO STAY

668
00:18:04,814 --> 00:18:05,482
TUNED.

669
00:18:05,482 --> 00:18:06,316
>> AND STAY TUNED FOR THE

670
00:18:06,316 --> 00:18:07,617
EXCITING CONCLUSION OF THE WATER

671
00:18:07,617 --> 00:18:09,853
TOWER STORY.

672
00:18:09,853 --> 00:18:11,421
>> I FORGOT IT.

673
00:18:11,421 --> 00:18:13,390
>> I DON'T.

674
00:18:24,401 --> 00:18:25,635
>> IF ANY OF YOU HAVE ANY

675
00:18:25,635 --> 00:18:27,303
TEENAGERS IN THE HOUSE, YOU

676
00:18:27,303 --> 00:18:28,638
MIGHT WANT TO VIDEOTAPE THIS

677
00:18:28,638 --> 00:18:30,040
PART SO THAT YOU CAN ERASE IT

678
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,508
LATER.

679
00:18:31,508 --> 00:18:32,542
I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT

680
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:35,512
THEY CALL "FREE LOVE."

681
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:36,880
NOW I'M NOT SAYING WHAT'S RIGHT

682
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,215
AND WHAT'S WRONG, BUT GOLLY,

683
00:18:39,215 --> 00:18:41,284
IT'S A--IT'S A BAD THING.

684
00:18:41,284 --> 00:18:42,719
SO, ALL YOU TEENAGE GIRLS THERE

685
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:45,321
IN PARTICULAR, WHENEVER YOU GET

686
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:46,423
A REQUEST FROM A BOY OF THE

687
00:18:46,423 --> 00:18:48,925
OPPOSITE SEX ALONG THE FREE LOVE

688
00:18:48,925 --> 00:18:50,860
LINE, I'M ASKING YOU TO JUST SAY

689
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,362
"NO."

690
00:18:52,362 --> 00:18:53,463
THAT'S--THAT'S ONLY FAIR TO--

691
00:18:53,463 --> 00:18:54,364
TO THOSE OF US FROM AN OLDER

692
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:56,366
GENERATION WHO GREW UP WHEN

693
00:18:56,366 --> 00:18:57,534
THINGS WERE REAL UPTIGHT AND

694
00:18:57,534 --> 00:18:58,835
CELIBATE AND CELIBACY AND SO ON,

695
00:18:58,835 --> 00:18:59,669
AND YOU WEREN'T ALLOWED TO DO

696
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:00,336
ANYTHING.

697
00:19:00,336 --> 00:19:01,337
SO WE DON'T ENJOY YOU BEING

698
00:19:01,337 --> 00:19:02,305
ALLOWED TO ENJOY THINGS THAT WE

699
00:19:02,305 --> 00:19:03,406
WEREN'T ALLOWED TO ENJOY.

700
00:19:03,406 --> 00:19:06,476
IT'S JUST--IT'S NOT ENJOYABLE.

701
00:19:06,476 --> 00:19:07,710
I THINK JUST TO SAY "NO" IN THE

702
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:10,513
INTERESTS OF FAIR PLAY.

703
00:19:10,513 --> 00:19:11,247
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO GO.

704
00:19:11,247 --> 00:19:12,782
I KNOW I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT TO

705
00:19:12,782 --> 00:19:13,483
DO.

706
00:19:13,483 --> 00:19:14,350
ALL RIGHT, YOU DO WHATEVER YOU

707
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,718
WANT TO DO, BUT I'LL TELL YOU

708
00:19:15,718 --> 00:19:16,653
ONE THING.

709
00:19:16,653 --> 00:19:17,854
UP AT THE LODGE, OUR ATTITUDE

710
00:19:17,854 --> 00:19:19,923
TOWARDS FREE LOVE IS "YOU GET

711
00:19:19,923 --> 00:19:22,625
WHAT YOU PAY FOR."

712
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:23,626
>> [yelling]

713
00:19:23,626 --> 00:19:24,627
OKAY, IT'S JUST A GAME!

714
00:19:24,627 --> 00:19:25,495
JUST A GAME.

715
00:19:25,495 --> 00:19:27,330

716
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:27,997

718
00:19:28,998 --> 00:19:29,999
BREATHE DEEP, BOB.

719
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:30,767
HEAD DOWN.

720
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:31,434
>> BOB.

721
00:19:31,434 --> 00:19:32,101

WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A SHOT?

741
00:19:55,892 --> 00:19:57,293

850
00:22:19,735 --> 00:22:21,237
THE TREES STARTED TO BEND LIKE

851
00:22:21,237 --> 00:22:21,904
THIS.

852
00:22:21,904 --> 00:22:22,905
THEY WERE ALL HUNCHED OVER WORSE

853
00:22:22,905 --> 00:22:23,906
THAN OLD MAN SEDGEWICK.

854
00:22:23,906 --> 00:22:25,508
[laughs]

855
00:22:25,508 --> 00:22:26,542
AND THEN YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED

856
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:27,510
THEN?

857
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,177
NOTHING.

858
00:22:28,177 --> 00:22:29,245
NO WATER WAS COMING OUT THE

859
00:22:29,245 --> 00:22:30,246
BOTTOM OR NOTHING AS THEY HAD

860
00:22:30,246 --> 00:22:30,913
PLANNED.

861
00:22:30,913 --> 00:22:31,914
YOU KNOW WHY?

862
00:22:31,914 --> 00:22:32,581
[laughs]

863
00:22:32,581 --> 00:22:34,417
THEY FORGOT TO PUT A HOSE IN IT.

864
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:35,084
YEAH.

865
00:22:35,084 --> 00:22:36,619
SO, STINKY PETERSON--HE'S THE

866
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:37,653
BRAINS OF THE GROUP, RIGHT?

867
00:22:37,653 --> 00:22:38,387
HE GETS THIS IDEA.

868
00:22:38,387 --> 00:22:39,822
HE FIGURES "HEY, LET'S THROW A

869
00:22:39,822 --> 00:22:40,823
LAWN DART AT IT."

870
00:22:40,823 --> 00:22:42,758
[laughs]

871
00:22:42,758 --> 00:22:43,726
NOW, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T

872
00:22:43,726 --> 00:22:46,429
KNOW THE WORD "FLOOD,"

873
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:47,129
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED.

874
00:22:47,129 --> 00:22:48,397
WE LOST ALL THE TREES, FOUR

875
00:22:48,397 --> 00:22:49,598
OUTBUILDINGS, AND 3 INCHES

876
00:22:49,598 --> 00:22:50,699
OF TOPSOIL.

877
00:22:50,699 --> 00:22:52,668
[laughs]

878
00:22:54,703 --> 00:22:55,371
SEE, UNCLE RED?

879
00:22:55,371 --> 00:22:57,339
IT WAS A GOOD STORY.
