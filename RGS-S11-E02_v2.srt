YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS 19 THE
LEGAL DRINKING AGE WAS 21,

163
00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:31,743
SO ME AND MY FRIENDS HAD TO
GET FAKE I.D. FROM WHEREVER,

JUST SO WE COULD GET
INTO THE BARS.

00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,462
WHICH IS NOW THE FRONT
OF THE BOAT, APPARENTLY.

300
00:14:58,495 --> 00:15:00,731
AND THEN MIKE SAYS,
JUST HOIST THE MIZZENMAST,

301
00:15:00,798 --> 00:15:02,499
OR WHATEVER IT IS,
AND UP SHE GOES.

302
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:04,301
AND WE GOT THE
TARP AS A SAIL,

303
00:15:04,368 --> 00:15:06,703
AND, BY GOLLY, BY THE TIME
WALTER WHEELED HER IN,

304
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:09,139
HEY, WE WERE UNDERWAY.

305
00:15:09,173 --> 00:15:11,842
AND, UH, KINDA DIFFERENT.

306
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:14,845
WHAT MIKE HADN'T --
THAT WAS UNFORTUNATE.

307
00:15:14,912 --> 00:15:16,814
WHAT HE HADN'T REALIZED
WAS THAT THERE'S

308
00:15:16,847 --> 00:15:18,949
A KIND OF A LOW BRIDGE
BETWEEN THE LODGE
AND THE TOWN,

309
00:15:19,016 --> 00:15:22,653
LOWER THAN,
SAY, THE MAST.

310
00:15:22,686 --> 00:15:24,688
AND SO WALTER
AND I BAILED OUT,

311
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:26,723
BUT MIKE, HE TOOK THE
HIT FOR THE TEAM,

312
00:15:26,757 --> 00:15:29,159
AND OF COURSE THE
PROBLEM NOW IS

313
00:15:29,226 --> 00:15:31,061
THAT MIKE REALLY CAN'T
SEE WHERE HE'S GOI,

314
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:33,630
AND, OF COURSE, THERE
IS THE QUARRY THERE.

00:15:36,099 --> 00:15:37,835
HIS VERSION OF THE
"PERFECT STORM,"

316
00:15:37,868 --> 00:15:40,604
BUT I THINK MIKE IS
FINISHED WITH SAILING.

317
00:15:40,671 --> 00:15:42,840

IN THE MAKING.

THAT WE SHOULD
BE ANSWERING.

IT'S PROBABLY MALARIA.

DON'T TELL YOUR WIFE A THING
UNTIL YOU BECOME KING.

00:17:39,389 --> 00:17:40,991
THAT WAY, IF SHE GIVES
YOU ANY GRIEF AT ALL,

YOU CAN HAVE HER
LOCKED UP IN SCOTLAND.

YOU BECOME KING.

OF THE HUSBAND OF QUEEN

DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY
MAKE YOU KING.

GONNA HAVE TO RE-THINK
HIS WHOLE PLAN.

00:18:18,862 --> 00:18:21,031
NOW, MY ADVICE
TO THIS PERSON IS

374
00:18:21,097 --> 00:18:23,099
IF YOU WANT TO BE
MARRIED TO A QUEEN,

375
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,969
THEN YOU COULD PRACTICE BY
TREATING THE WIFE YOU
HAVE LIKE ONE NOW.

THAT IS SOUND ADVICE
FOR ANY MARRIED MAN.

YOU GUYS HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

IF YOU COME TO SIT
DOWN TO DINNER

AND THERE'S A NINE-INCH
FLAME ON YOUR CANDLE,

381
00:18:42,118 --> 00:18:44,254
YOU BETTER GET YOUR
SEPTICS PUMPED OUT,

382
00:18:44,287 --> 00:18:47,023
OR YOU'LL HAVE MORE ON YOUR
PLATE THAN YOU CAN HANDLE.

I'LL TELL YOU,
IT'S NO FUN BEIN' AN AGENT.

385
00:18:56,399 --> 00:18:58,835
I JUST MADE A COUPLE OF
VERY SIMPLE DEMANDS

REGARDING RATE OF PAY AND
DRESSING ROOM BEVERAGES,

387
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:04,507
AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW
THEY KICKED ME OUT OF
THE THEATRE

388
00:19:04,574 --> 00:19:05,809
AND TOLD ME NEVER
TO COME BACK.

NOT MY FAULT.

OKAY, THOSE MORONS
DON'T KNOW TALENT.

A SMALL PROBLEM.

WELL, I'M A
PROBLEM-SOLVER, DALTON.

401
00:19:35,672 --> 00:19:37,607
THAT'S WHY YOU PAY
ME THE 25 PERCENT.

402

I THOUGHT IT
WAS 20 PERCENT!
