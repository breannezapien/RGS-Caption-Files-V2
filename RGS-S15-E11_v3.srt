chum or teacher,

161
00:07:10,195 --> 00:07:14,800
turn it around so you always
hand them the grip first.

162
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,268
Yeah, and make sure
the safety is on, right?

163
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:17,769
Well, that goes
without saying.

164
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:19,938
I always have
the safety on.

165
00:07:19,938 --> 00:07:22,507
Oh, yeah, okay.

166
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:26,845
There we go.

167
00:07:26,845 --> 00:07:30,716
Safety --
[ BEAR GROWLS LOUDLY ]

168
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:36,221
I don't have the gun,
do you have the gun?

169
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:37,656
I don't have the gun.

170
00:07:37,656 --> 00:07:39,057
Do you think the
bear has the gun?

171
00:07:39,057 --> 00:07:40,959
Very much so, yes.

172
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,494
Okay.
Okay.

173
00:07:42,494 --> 00:07:43,595
Don't panic.
Don't panic.

174
00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:45,764
Don't forget, the
safety is still on.

175
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:46,598
Right.

176
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:49,301
[ SAFETY CLICKS OFF ]

177
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:51,303
Oh.
Oh.

178
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:54,973
Okay, if you stand
still, he won't shoot.

179
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:02,848
It was just a theory.

180
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:06,017
Hey, Ed, you're okay,

181
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:07,486
there's only one
dart in that gun.

182
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:09,454
Oh.

183
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,426
Well, it was
just a theory.

184
00:08:20,565 --> 00:08:23,201
Some of you young people
may not know what this is.

185
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:26,104
Heck, most of you
aren't even watching.

186
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:28,173
Well, this is a water wheel

187
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:31,376
used to power the old flour
mill down by Mercury Creek.

188
00:08:31,376 --> 00:08:34,646
The rushing water turned the
wheel and ground the wheat.

189
00:08:34,646 --> 00:08:37,415
Mind you, we don't do
it that way anymore.

190
00:08:37,415 --> 00:08:40,852
I'm going back like
six months ago.

191
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:43,822
But just because something
is old and rotten

192
00:08:43,822 --> 00:08:46,891
and smells funny doesn't
mean it's useless.

193
00:08:46,891 --> 00:08:49,628
Hey, that could be
the new lodge slogan.

194
00:08:49,628 --> 00:08:51,796
We're going to think
outside the box.

195
00:08:51,796 --> 00:08:53,965
Might as well, you're not
going to do much thinking

196
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:56,601
once you're in the box.

197
00:08:56,601 --> 00:08:58,903
Everybody is harping
now about emissions

198
00:08:58,903 --> 00:09:03,908
and how global warming is making
the whales sweat to death.

199
00:09:03,908 --> 00:09:05,944
we're just throwing it away.

200
00:09:05,944 --> 00:09:07,545
So this time on
Handyman Corner,

201
00:09:07,545 --> 00:09:11,216
we're going to make
a car that runs on water.

202
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:14,252
I happen to have a car here
that the engine fell out of.

203
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:16,755
I guess I was
just born lucky.

204
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:20,358
Oh, no, wait a sec, the
engine is still in there.

205
00:09:20,358 --> 00:09:22,727
This project is going to take
a little longer than I thought.

206
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,232
There we go.

207
00:09:29,467 --> 00:09:32,504
Get yourself a bathtub
that nobody is using,

208
00:09:32,504 --> 00:09:35,306
maybe from a frat house.

209
00:09:35,306 --> 00:09:38,843
I'm just filling her up
here at self-serve.

210
00:09:38,843 --> 00:09:42,313
By the way, you might want
to have a real loud radio
in the vehicle,

211
00:09:42,313 --> 00:09:44,749
because if all you hear
is the water tinkling,

212
00:09:44,749 --> 00:09:47,418
you'll be stopping at
every rest area you come to.

213
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:53,258
I got a piece of down spout
running from the drain

214
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:56,628
so I can direct the water
and this valve controls it.

215
00:09:56,628 --> 00:09:59,130
This is the linkage from my
gas pedal to open the valve

216
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,699
and I got a bungie on
there to shut her off.

217
00:10:01,699 --> 00:10:04,202
I got her set up so the
water comes down the pipe

218
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:06,771
and falls onto
my water wheel,

219
00:10:06,771 --> 00:10:08,540
which is hooked into
the transmission,

220
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,543
so I'll be grinding gears
instead of flour.

221
00:10:11,543 --> 00:10:13,945
Now, the bathtub holds
about 50 gallons,

222
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:17,048
so I figure I should get
at least 100 miles
between fill-ups,

223
00:10:17,048 --> 00:10:19,117
even more if it rains.

224
00:10:19,117 --> 00:10:20,952
You people that live
on the west coast

225
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:22,820
will be able
to go for months.

226
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,055
So there you have it,

227
00:10:24,055 --> 00:10:27,158
I've built a zero emissions
fuel efficient car

228
00:10:27,158 --> 00:10:29,260
and I've saved the
planet for free.

229
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,829
Now, you're probably thinking
I'll get a Nobel prize
for physics.

230
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:33,398
Forget about it.

231
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:35,934
Talk about people who don't
return phone calls.

232
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:39,537
But, hey, that's all water
under the bridge

233
00:10:39,537 --> 00:10:42,607
or as I call it,
water under the car.

234
00:10:42,607 --> 00:10:45,243
So, remember, if the women
don't find you handsome,

235
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:46,978
they should at least
find you handy.

236
00:10:55,186 --> 00:10:57,822
Oh, oh, oh, I forgot,

237
00:10:57,822 --> 00:11:00,391
this thing runs
on high test.

238
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:22,013
There are a few things that
separate men from the animals.

239
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:25,249
We get to walk upright and talk
to good looking women,

240
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:28,953
they get to live in the
woods and eat their young.

241
00:11:28,953 --> 00:11:31,522
On the other hand, we
get to pay income tax

242
00:11:31,522 --> 00:11:35,159
and they get to
lick themselves.

243
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:38,129
But the main thing we have
that the animals don't

244
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:39,530
is foresight,

245
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,699
the ability to predict
the long-term outcome

246
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:45,470
of our actions and change
our behaviour accordingly.

247
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:50,208
The truth is, most men don't
start out with much foresight,

248
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:54,111
and the longer they live,
the less of it they retain.

249
00:11:54,111 --> 00:11:56,414
It's why men have
thoughts like,

250
00:11:56,414 --> 00:11:58,516
why would I stop for gas
when I still have

251
00:11:58,516 --> 00:12:02,753
a sixty-fourth
of a tank left?

252
00:12:02,753 --> 00:12:04,989
Or, I'll just leave
this drawer open

253
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:09,026
while I stick my head into the
cupboard directly below it.

254
00:12:09,026 --> 00:12:11,395
Or, hey, if I feel this
good after two beers,

255
00:12:11,395 --> 00:12:15,199
imagine how good I'll
feel after five?

256
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:17,568
We know we're going
to pay later,

257
00:12:17,568 --> 00:12:19,103
but we do it anyway.

258
00:12:19,103 --> 00:12:21,305
It's almost like the
guy we are right now

259
00:12:21,305 --> 00:12:23,407
really doesn't like
the guy we will be

260
00:12:23,407 --> 00:12:25,776
ten minutes from now.

261
00:12:25,776 --> 00:12:27,912
And if you're married,
you not only suffer

262
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:29,647
from your lack
of foresight,

263
00:12:29,647 --> 00:12:31,816
you may have to put up
with an annoyed wife

264
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:33,384
who criticizes
you for acting

265
00:12:33,384 --> 00:12:35,419
without thinking of
the consequences.

266
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:36,921
Well, you just go
ahead and remind her

267
00:12:36,921 --> 00:12:38,823
that she is
not much better.

268
00:12:38,823 --> 00:12:42,193
You're not the only
one who said "I do".

269
00:12:43,694 --> 00:12:47,064
Or maybe that's just something
you and I can know and
not mention.

270
00:12:47,064 --> 00:12:49,700
That's called foresight.

271
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,435
Remember,
I'm pulling for you.

272
00:12:51,435 --> 00:12:53,504
We're all
in this together.

273
00:12:57,174 --> 00:13:00,411
Roses are brown,
violets are smothered?

274
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:04,081
time to call Rothschild's
before the whole lawn
is covered!

275
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:16,160
Man, we go down to city
hall to get the permit
for our air show,

276
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,931
Honest Abe here tells them
we're like recreating
the London blitz.

277
00:13:20,931 --> 00:13:23,634
Well, I think it's always
best to be completely
truthful.

278
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:27,071
I can't wait 'til
you get married.

279
00:13:28,038 --> 00:13:29,740
Well, you can't pretend
it's a picnic

280
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,308
and have all these antique
planes flying overhead

281
00:13:31,308 --> 00:13:33,444
dropping bombs
and everything.

282
00:13:33,444 --> 00:13:35,713
I think somebody
might notice.

283
00:13:35,713 --> 00:13:37,882
It's no wonder we
were refused a permit.

284
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:39,383
Yeah, so, okay.

285
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:40,751
Now I need a
different plan, see.

286
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:43,654
A true promoter always
figures a way out.

287
00:13:43,654 --> 00:13:46,590
What would P.T. Barnum do
if he lived in Possum Lake?

288
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,626
Move.

289
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:51,295
Wait a minute
Oh, no.

290
00:13:51,295 --> 00:13:53,430
What do we have here
in Possum Lake, Harold?

291
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:56,033
Inbreeding?

292
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:58,369
We have a model
airplane club.

293
00:13:58,369 --> 00:14:01,539
We'll put on the air show
using model airplanes.

294
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:04,108
Oh, oh, oh!

295
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:06,544
Why didn't
I think of that?

296
00:14:06,544 --> 00:14:10,447
Oh, I know why,
because it's ridiculous.

297
00:14:10,447 --> 00:14:11,916
It's not ridiculous.

298
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,550
It's brilliant,
Harold, okay?

299
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,119
People will come
to an air show,

300
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:16,687
model planes will fly by,

301
00:14:16,687 --> 00:14:19,924
up near the sun so they're
squinting, you know.

302
00:14:19,924 --> 00:14:21,158
They got themselves
an air show.

303
00:14:21,158 --> 00:14:22,860
People see what
they want to see.

304
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,728
Yeah, but what about
what they hear?

305
00:14:24,728 --> 00:14:26,297
I mean,
a real plane goes...

306
00:14:26,297 --> 00:14:28,232
[ ENGINE SOUNDS ]

307
00:14:28,232 --> 00:14:31,769
A model airplane goes...
[ MODEL ENGINE SOUND ]

308
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:33,704
I don't think people
are that gullible.

309
00:14:33,704 --> 00:14:37,007
Oh sure they are,
you got engaged.

310
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,910
Oh.

311
00:14:43,213 --> 00:14:45,616
RED: Boy I wish Bill would
stay sitting down.

312
00:14:45,616 --> 00:14:47,384
Anyway, can't do anything
about that now.

313
00:14:47,384 --> 00:14:48,352
We're on our way over
to one of these places

314
00:14:48,352 --> 00:14:50,020
where they have these
rope ride things,

315
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,388
I don't know what
you call them.

316
00:14:51,388 --> 00:14:53,090
But Bill's door was kind
of jammed so I came in
to help him,

317
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,225
but he was...

318
00:14:55,225 --> 00:14:57,061
well, you know, he's out.

319
00:14:57,061 --> 00:14:57,995
Okay, no harm done.

320
00:14:57,995 --> 00:14:59,096
No harm done.

321
00:14:59,096 --> 00:15:01,565
Okay, some harm done.

322
00:15:01,565 --> 00:15:02,900
They find something.

323
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,368
So there's like the
demonstrator guy

324
00:15:04,368 --> 00:15:05,636
and it's way up on a pole

325
00:15:05,636 --> 00:15:08,005
and what he does is he
hooks kind of a tether
on to this line

326
00:15:08,005 --> 00:15:09,673
and away he goes.

327
00:15:09,673 --> 00:15:12,643
And I wasn't quite
sure why we were here.

328
00:15:12,643 --> 00:15:14,511
I thought, okay,
that's good,

329
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:16,013
but Bill was really
excited about it.

330
00:15:16,013 --> 00:15:17,347
And -- ow!

331
00:15:17,347 --> 00:15:20,851
And so the fellow comes over
and for some reason

332
00:15:20,851 --> 00:15:22,886
he hands me the harness
and the helmet.

333
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:24,221
I don't know.

334
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:25,456
What?
No, no.

335
00:15:25,456 --> 00:15:27,090
They both seem to
have the impression

336
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,659
that I would somehow
be interested

337
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:30,227
in doing something
along that line.

338
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:32,196
And no, Bill,
you're so excited,

339
00:15:32,196 --> 00:15:34,031
you know what,
you go 12 times

340
00:15:34,031 --> 00:15:35,232
and then I will
think about it.

341
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:37,768
No, no, I'm
saying no, you go.

342
00:15:37,768 --> 00:15:39,136
Okay.

343
00:15:39,136 --> 00:15:40,938
So I got an idea,
so call heads or tails,

344
00:15:40,938 --> 00:15:42,139
okay, heads or tails.

345
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:43,340
Now, Bill has got
to make a decision,

346
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,643
that's heads and he makes it
tails and back to heads

347
00:15:46,643 --> 00:15:51,148
and then I see my life
passing in front of my eyes

348
00:15:51,148 --> 00:15:55,219
so finally -- I don't have a
coin anyway, it doesn't matter.

349
00:15:57,554 --> 00:15:59,289
So now he tries
to go up the pole.

350
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:03,460
Bill, this may not be the pole
you really want to climb.

351
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,395
The way it works with
these rope things,

352
00:16:05,395 --> 00:16:06,797
you don't actually
climb up,

353
00:16:06,797 --> 00:16:08,265
they have like the tether
rope and it comes down

354
00:16:08,265 --> 00:16:11,668
and hooks onto your harness,
and then you get somebody
to pull down,

355
00:16:11,668 --> 00:16:14,071
which would be me, and that's
supposed to lift you up.

356
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:17,240
Well, I tell you what -- oh.

357
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,177
But I just didn't,
you know,

358
00:16:20,177 --> 00:16:22,112
you get them to
a certain height

359
00:16:22,112 --> 00:16:23,880
and you can't get your
hands to go up and over.

360
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,482
And I thought what am
I going to do?

361
00:16:25,482 --> 00:16:26,917
You know, I'm thinking
to myself

362
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:30,387
there's got to be a better
way and there is.

363
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:38,695
So Bill gets up on top of
the little stand there.

364
00:16:38,695 --> 00:16:41,331
And, I mean, I have to
admire his courage.

365
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:43,200
I was saying, I have to
admire your courage, Bill.

366
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,801
Oh, I can't watch this.

367
00:16:44,801 --> 00:16:47,270
Come on Bill, come on,
no come on, come on.

368
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,672
I'm not coming up
there for you,

369
00:16:48,672 --> 00:16:50,640
you might as well go,
you might as well jump.

370
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,610
So finally he just
gives it a go

371
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,680
and it doesn't go so good.

372
00:16:57,514 --> 00:16:58,949
He starts heading
for the van.

373
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:00,183
Oh!

374
00:17:01,451 --> 00:17:04,488
And the tether rope flies up
and hits the high tension wire.

375
00:17:04,488 --> 00:17:10,026
And, boy, Bill has never
looked so electrically
charged up there.

376
00:17:10,894 --> 00:17:12,829
Oh!

377
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,164
All right.

378
00:17:14,164 --> 00:17:16,166
And that's Bill's adventure.

379
00:17:24,741 --> 00:17:27,978
You see a lot of unusual
things in people's bathrooms.

380
00:17:27,978 --> 00:17:30,013
It's fun to look actually.

381
00:17:30,013 --> 00:17:33,617
One thing you hardly ever
see is a smoke detector.

382
00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:35,719
I guess it reminds them
of being on a plane,

383
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:36,786
I don't know.

384
00:17:36,786 --> 00:17:39,022
But to me that's
shortsighted.

385
00:17:39,022 --> 00:17:40,857
Now, you may be thinking,

386
00:17:40,857 --> 00:17:43,994
I won't be able to hear that
smoke alarm from the bedroom,

387
00:17:43,994 --> 00:17:48,765
or where am I going to smoke
so the kids won't see me now?

388
00:17:48,765 --> 00:17:51,801
Or change
the channel, honey.

389
00:17:51,801 --> 00:17:55,171
But, hey, smoke detectors are
not only sensitive to smoke,

390
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:57,274
they're also
sensitive to steam.

391
00:17:57,274 --> 00:17:59,876
And nothing steams me more
than house guests
taking showers

392
00:17:59,876 --> 00:18:03,513
that are too long,
too hot and too expensive.

393
00:18:03,513 --> 00:18:06,149
Long, hot and expensive are
three things that
are never good

394
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:09,686
unless you're talking about
one of those late night
movies on cable.

395
00:18:09,686 --> 00:18:11,655
Here is how to shorten
those showers.

396
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:14,324
Once you have installed
the smoke detector,

397
00:18:14,324 --> 00:18:17,260
get yourself one of these sound
activated goofy looking dolls

couple of Mai Tais.

400
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:27,971
You know, the Santa doll
is a great choice

401
00:18:27,971 --> 00:18:30,073
because most of our house

403

Now, I asked Harold
to take a shower,

404
00:18:35,178 --> 00:18:36,846
a hot shower for a change

405

Okay.

423
00:19:24,494 --> 00:19:26,729
See, the problem was that

way up in the sky,

425
00:19:28,064 --> 00:19:29,832
so I told the operators
to bring them down low

00:21:21,177 --> 00:21:22,845
if I have to

471
00:21:22,845 --> 00:21:24,046
I guess.

472
00:21:25,281 --> 00:21:27,516
All right, men, in fairness
to the model airplane club,

473
00:21:27,516 --> 00:21:29,352
I need some
volunteers to help

474
00:21:29,352 --> 00:21:32,989
glue all the airplanes
back together.

475
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:36,559
Now, we're going to be working
in a well-ventilated area,

476
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,429
which with you guys
is never a bad idea.
