00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:05,405
YOU KNOW, I’VE SEEN PEOPLE
PUT SOME PRETTY WEIRD
STUFF INTO HAMBURGERS

MAN, MAYBE IT'S JUST ME,

5
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:14,614
BUT WHEN A PATTY COMES THAT
CLOSED TO CONTAINING ALL
FIVE FOOD GROUPS,

6
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:18,885
IT PRETTY MUCH RUINS THE
POINT OF EATING RED MEAT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

7
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:21,988
PERSONALLY, I HAVE MY
OWN SECRET INGREDIENT.

00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:24,390
IT'S CHEAP, IT'S PLENTIFUL,
AND HERE'S THE BEST PART...

00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,826
IT WON'T DO A DARNED
THING FOR YOUR HEALTH.

WHAT YOU WANNA DO IS

12
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:34,701
STICK ABOUT A DOZEN OF THESE
KERNELS INTO ONE SIDE
OF THE PATTY,

13
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:38,538
AND THEN LAY HER DOWN
ON THE B.B.Q. WITH
THAT SIDE DOWN.

14
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,373
THEN YOU JUST GO RELAX.

15
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:42,842
AND THERE YOU HAVE IT.

16
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,811
WHILE THE POPCORN DOESN'T
DO MUCH FOR THE TASTE

17
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,613
OR HOLDING
THE MEAT TOGETHER,

18
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:49,682
I JUST DON'T LIKE
STANDING OVER A HOT

WE GOT A LOTTA FAMILIES
COMING UP HERE.

00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:19,838
THEY ALWAYS HAVE A BUNCH

DRIVING EVERYBODY NUTS.

150
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:25,977
SO I DECIDED TO MAKE
A RIDE FOR THE KIDDIES,

151
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:28,613
LIKE THE ONES THEY USED TO
HAVE AT THE GROCERY STORE.

152
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,749
OR MAYBE IT WAS A LITTLE
CAR OR A FAKE PONY

153
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:32,184
OR A ROCKET SHIP.

154
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,585
YOU'D STICK STICK
A DIME IN THERE,

155
00:07:33,618 --> 00:07:35,020
AND IT WOULD SHAKE
FOR A MINUTE.

156
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,822
THAT WAS GOOD VALUE,
WASN'T IT?

157
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:38,623
I FIGURE I CAN MAKE
SOMETHING BETTER THAN THAT

158
00:07:38,657 --> 00:07:40,892
OUT OF THIS OLD COIN-OPERATED
WASHING MACHINE

159
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,527
THEY THREW OUT
AT THE LAUNDRY MAT

160
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:44,830
AFTER SOMEBODY TRIED
TO WASH MATTRESS IN IT.

161
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:47,032
WHO KNEW?

162
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,668
AND I'LL TELL YOU,
AT 10 CENTS A POP,

163
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:52,804
THIS IS THE BIGGEST CASH COW
THE LODGE HAS SEEN SINCE,

164
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:55,440
WELL, EVER.

165
00:07:55,774 --> 00:07:58,844
NOW ALL WE DO IS ATTACH MY
BAR STOOL TO THE AGITATOR,

166
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,113
AND THAT'LL GIVE US THAT
BACK AND FORTH MOTION

167
00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:02,881
THAT THE YOUNGSTERS
REALLY ENJOY --

168
00:08:02,948 --> 00:08:05,984
UNTIL THEY GET DIZZY AND BARF
ALL OVER EVERYBODY.

169
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:08,119
BUT FIRST I GOTTA GET THE
AGITATOR OUTTA THERE.

170
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:14,860
OKAY, I USED THE
HANDYMAN'S SECRET WEAPON

171
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:17,996
TO ATTACH MY BARSTOOL
POLE ONTO THE AGITATOR.

172
00:08:18,063 --> 00:08:19,664
BUT I TOOK THE
SEAT OFF FIRST,

173
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:21,600
BECAUSE I REALLY WANT TO
MAXIMIZE THE ENJOYMENT

174
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:23,702
THAT A YOUNGSTER IS GOING
TO GET OUT OF THIS.

175
00:08:23,735 --> 00:08:26,137
SEE, NOW, IF I MOUNT
THE SEAT NORMALLY,

176
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:28,573
ALL YOU GET IS THE
NORMAL AGITATOR ACTION.

177
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,711
BUT FOR THAT EXTRA THRILL
YOU WANNA GO OFF CENTRE.

178
00:08:32,744 --> 00:08:34,512
IF THERE'S ONE THING
WE DO WELL AT THE LODGE

179
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:37,315
IT'S GO OFF CENTRE.

180
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:43,121
OKAY, I THINK WE'RE READY
FOR A LITTLE DEMONSTRATION.

181
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:46,558
ACTUALLY GONNA USE A STUFFED
ANIMAL AS MY TEST PILOT

182
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,861
BECAUSE STUFFED ANIMALS
DON'T HAVE PARENTS
THAT'LL SUE YOU.

183
00:08:50,962 --> 00:08:53,531
AS A LITTLE EXTRA
SAFETY FEATURE,

184
00:08:53,565 --> 00:08:56,034
I'M GONNA THROW
A SEAT BELT ON HERE.

185
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:59,471

IDEA FOR ALL THE BARSTOOLS
UP AT THE LODGE.

LINING UP FOR THIS ONE.

PASSED, NATURE HAS TAKEN

AND YOU HAVE NOT BEEN KEEPING
UP WITH THE CURRICULUM.

SAW YOUR HIKING BOOTS?

TIME YOU SAW YOUR FEET?

GRAB THE OL' KNAPSACK

BEFORE HIKING UP
THE MOUNTAIN?

GRAB A NAP IN THE SACK
BEFORE HIKING UP YOUR PANTS!

EVERYBODY SIT DOWN.
COME ON, SIT DOWN.

458
00:21:25,548 --> 00:21:27,183
EVERYBODY SIT DOWN.

459
00:21:27,216 --> 00:21:29,819
GATHER AROUND.

460
00:21:29,886 --> 00:21:31,954
ALL RISE!

461
00:21:34,957 --> 00:21:37,593
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI.

462
00:21:37,627 --> 00:21:39,829
Red: SIT DOWN.

463
00:21:40,162 --> 00:21:43,199
ALL RIGHT, MEN, BOW YOUR HEADS
FOR THE MEN'S PRAYER.

464
00:21:43,232 --> 00:21:45,668
I'M A MAN, BUT I CAN CHANGE,

465
00:21:45,735 --> 00:21:48,604
IF I HAVE TO, I GUESS.

466
00:21:55,911 --> 00:21:57,647
YOU ALL REMEMBER HAROLD,

467
00:21:57,713 --> 00:22:01,350
THE PROUD BIRD WITH
THE SKINNY, HAIRLESS TAIL?
