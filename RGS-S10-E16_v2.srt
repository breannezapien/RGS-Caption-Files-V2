1
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:04,404
THEY SAY THERE’S GOING TO BE
A BIG SNOW STORM TONIGHT.

2
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:06,272
WHICH MEANS THAT IF I WANT
TO GO ANYWHERE TOMORROW,

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,941
I'LL HAVE TO SHOVEL
OUT THE DRIVEWAY,

4
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:09,776
AND OF COURSE I'LL
HAVE A HEART ATTACK,

5
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:13,380
AND THAT'LL LEAD TO A BIG
ARGUMENT WITH MY WIFE ABOUT
ADEQUATE INSURANCE COVERAGE.

6
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:15,382
SO TO AVOID ALL THAT

7
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:18,284
I'VE HOOKED UP
A RIG HERE, WHICH I
THINK IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT.

8
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:21,321
LAID DOWN A COUPLE OF
SHEETS OF MARINE PLYWOOD,

9
00:00:21,387 --> 00:00:23,556
AND I GOT THIS ROPE RUNNING
FROM THE CENTRES

10
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,992
UP THROUGH THESE PULLEYS
ON THE SIDES OF THE GARAGE,

11
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,294
DOWN TO THIS
LITTLE RAMP HERE.

12
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,463
NOW, JUST IMAGINE IF THIS
WAS ALL COVERED WITH SNOW.

13
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,298
LET ME SHOW YOU
WHAT HAPPENS.

14
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:52,385
[ CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ]

15
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,528
ALL RIGHT.

16
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,563
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

17
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,398
EASY.

18
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:07,133
YEAH, BOY, I APPRECIATE THAT.

19
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:09,435
WELL, I HAD A BIT OF A
DISCOVERY THIS WEEK,
UP AT THE LODGE.

20
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:11,571
APPARENTLY IF YOU'RE
A CLUB LIKE WE ARE,

21
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:13,573
AND YOU ASSOCIATE YOURSELF
WITH A CHARITYF SOME KIND,

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,508
YOU GET ALL SORTS OF
TREATS FROM THE GOVERNMENT.

23
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,710
I MEAN, THEY WILL GIVE US
TAX REFUNDS AND GRANTS,

24
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,246
AND THEY'LL STOP
TRYING TO CLOSE THE LODGE

25
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:23,616
AND STOP TRYING TO SEND US
ALL UP TO BAFFIN ISLAND.

26
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,652
SO, UH, WE'VE BEEN IN TOUCH
WITH A BUNCH OF CHARITIES.

27
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,186
SO FAR NO LUCK.

28
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:30,423
THEY'RE ALL SAYING THEY
DON'T NEED THE MONEY,
QUITE THAT BAD.

29
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,792
HEY, RED, LOOKS LIKE WE GOT
OURSELVES A CHARITY.

30
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,193
YEAH.
GREAT.

31
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,895
WHICH ONE?
RED CROSS,
SALVATION ARMY,

32
00:01:35,928 --> 00:01:37,363
DAUGHTERS OF
THE EMPIRE, MAYBE?

33
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:39,065
YEAH, RIGHT.

34
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:41,067
NO, RED, THIS IS ONE OF THE
LESSER KNOWN CHARITIES.

35
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,169
IT'S THE
DANDRUFF FOUNDATION.

36
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:46,406
THE DANDRUFF
FOUNDATION?

37
00:01:46,472 --> 00:01:48,207
WELL, THAT'S KIND
OF A LET DOWN;

38
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,910
ALTHOUGH, YOU'D MAKE
A GREAT POSTER BOY,
I'M THINKING.

39
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:55,114
NO, IT'S A REAL
DEDICATED GROUP, RED.

40
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,749
HAVE YOU HEARD
THEIR CAMPAIGN SLOGAN?

41
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,953
IT'S ALL
ON OUR SHOULDERS.

42
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,290
AND ALL THEY NEED FROM
THE LODGE IS A CHEQUE
FOR $500.00.

43
00:02:04,323 --> 00:02:06,025
PARDON ME?

44
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,261
$500.00 IS THE
MINIMUM DONATION

45
00:02:08,327 --> 00:02:10,463
THAT WILL QUALIFY US AS
AN AFFILIATED PARTNER.

46
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,098
WE DON'T HAVE THAT
KIND OF MONEY.

47
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:14,734
DO YOU THINK THEY'D ACCEPT
A '73 K-CAR AS PAYMENT?

48
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,369
MAYBE,

49
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:19,372
IF YOU PUT 500 BUCKS IN
THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT.

50
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,142
WHERE ARE WE GOING TO COME UP
WITH THAT KIND OF CASH, GUYS?

51
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,978
WELL, WHY DON'T WE SELL
PEANUTS OF CHOCOLATES,
DOOR-TO-DOOR

52
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,613
LIKE SOME OF THEM
OTHER CHARITIES?

53
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,283
YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE
WILL PAY TWO BUCKS FOR A
50-CENT CANDY BAR

54
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:32,885
JUST TO GET YOU OFF
THEIR PROPERTY.

55
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,720
NOW, YOU TELL ME WHAT
KIND OF CANDY YOU WANT,

56
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:37,156

CAN GET ALL THE STUFF

IT ISN'T MIKE,
IS IT?

58
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,694
NO, NO, MIKE GETS ALL
HIS STUFF FREE.

I KNOW, HE STEALS IT
FROM MY STORE.

NO, THE GUY I'M TALKING ABOUT
IMPORTS EVERYTHING FROM CHINA.

OF WORDS THERE, RED.

IN THERE, SOMEWHERE?

NO, IT WASN'T
IN THERE.

OH, I DON'T SMOKE.

153
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:28,914
MAYBE WE SHOULD RUSH
YOU TO A BINGO HALL.

154
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:34,986
YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY ENJOYS
FIREWORKS ON A SUMMER'S NIGHT.

155
00:07:35,053 --> 00:07:36,688
THEY CAN BE EXPENSIVE,

156
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:40,826
AND SOME STORES WON'T SELL
THEM TO YOU ON A BUY NOW
PAY LATER DEAL.

157
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:44,763
OR MAYBE THEY'VE BEEN WARNED
ABOUT YOU BY THE LOCAL
AUTHORITIES.

158
00:07:44,796 --> 00:07:46,598
SO THIS TIME,
ON HANDYMAN CORNER,

159
00:07:46,665 --> 00:07:49,701
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW
YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN
FIREWORKS DISPLAY

160
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:52,737
USING AN OLD RADIO
AND A BUNCH OF SCREEN DOORS.

161
00:07:54,673 --> 00:07:56,007
THIS IS A TUBE RADIO.

162
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,909
I'M SURE YOU YOUNG PEOPLE
DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

163
00:07:57,943 --> 00:08:00,445
BUT IN MY DAY, WE HAD TO TURN
THESE BABIES ON,

164
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,814
LET THEM WARM UP
BEFORE THEY'D WORK.

165
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:06,051
THAT'S HOW PEOPLE IN MY
GENERATION LEARNED
TO BE PATIENT.

166
00:08:06,117 --> 00:08:09,221
KIDS TODAY, THEY JUST
EXPECT EVERYTHING TO
TURN ON IMMEDIATELY,

167
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:12,090
THAT CAN BE A REAL PROBLEM
DURING A HONEYMOON,
I'LL TELL YOU.

168
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,725
NOW, WE'RE GOING TO
TAKE THE RADIO APART,

169
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:15,360
BECAUSE ALL WE NEED
IS THE TRANSFORMER,

170
00:08:15,427 --> 00:08:18,296
WHICH IS THIS HEAVY THING USED
TO STEP UP THE VOLTAGE.

171
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,898
IT DOES THAT BY INDUCTION.

172
00:08:19,931 --> 00:08:21,600
I'M NOT QUITE SURE
WHAT THAT IS,

173
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,168
BUT I'VE HEARD OF
PEOPLE BEING INDUCTED.

174
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:24,803
I'M SURE IT'S VERY SIMILAR.

175
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,805
ANOTHER THING YOU GOT TO WATCH
FOR IS THE CAPACITORS.

176
00:08:26,872 --> 00:08:29,307
A CAPACITOR CAN HOLD A CHARGE
OF SEVERAL THOUSAND VOLTS

177
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:32,811
LONG AFTER A
UNIT IS UNPLUGGED.

178
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:34,980
NOW, IS THAT A CAPACITOR,
OR IS THAT JUST A RESISTOR?

179
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:39,451
I THINK I'VE
JUST BEEN INDUCTED.

180
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,255
OKAY, I'VE GOT MY
TRANSFORMER OUT OF THERE,

181
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:46,458
AND I'VE ATTACHED THE OUTPUT
TO MY WALL OF SCREEN DOORS.

182
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:47,993
I'VE GOT A WIRE
ON EACH SIDE.

183
00:08:48,026 --> 00:08:51,196
I FIGURE I'VE GOT ABOUT
100,000 VOLTS RUNNING
THROUGH THESE BABIES.

184
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:53,131
I THREW AWAY THE WELCOME
MATS THAT CAME WITH THEM.

185
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:55,033
I DIDN'T WANT TO SEND
OUT A FALSE MESSAGE.

186
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:58,436
NOW, ALL I GOT TO DO IS
GET MYSELF COMFORTABLE.

187
00:08:58,503 --> 00:09:00,839
SOMEWHERE WHERE I'LL
HAVE A GOOD VIEW.

188
00:09:00,872 --> 00:09:03,675
THIS OUGHT TO BE
PERFECT RIGHT OVER HERE.

189
00:09:03,742 --> 00:09:05,744
THERE WE GO.

190
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,446
NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO IS
PLUG IN MY TRANSFORMER

191
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,682
AND WAIT FOR THE
FIREWORKS TO START.

192
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:21,259
OH, I KNOW.

193
00:09:21,326 --> 00:09:22,927
FORGOT TO TURN ON
MY LANTERN.

194
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:25,030
YOU NEED THAT
TO ATTRACT THE BUGS.

195
00:09:31,503 --> 00:09:33,805
( coughing )

196
00:09:33,872 --> 00:09:36,307
THAT ONE SMELLED
LIKE A BAT.

197
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:48,520
YOU KNOW, I KNOW THERE
ARE A LOT OF FACTORS

198
00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:49,954
THAT GO INTO MAKING
UP A HUMAN BEING.

199
00:09:49,988 --> 00:09:52,724
BUT THE MAIN ONE
HAS TO BE CHEMISTRY.

200
00:09:52,757 --> 00:09:58,229
AND FOR A MAN THE MAIN CHEMICAL
INGREDIENT HAS GOT TO BE
TESTOSTERONE.

201
00:09:58,296 --> 00:10:00,632
I MEAN, YOU TAKE
AN AVERAGE MAN

202
00:10:00,665 --> 00:10:02,967
AND YOU GREATLY REDUCE THE
TESTOSTERONE IN THERE,

203
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:05,136
AND YOU'LL EITHER
GET AN UGLY WOMAN

204
00:10:05,203 --> 00:10:10,408
OR A GUY WHO WALKS FUNNY
AND WORKS IN A HAREM.

205
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:13,244
NOW, I KNOW THERE ARE OTHER
CHEMICALS INVOLVED.

206
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,682
YOU GOT A TABLESPOON OF BILE;
YOU GOT A SIX-PACK OF BARLEY;

207
00:10:17,749 --> 00:10:22,854
YOU GOT A CUBIC FOOT OF
B.S.; AND A TANK FULL OF GAS.

208
00:10:22,887 --> 00:10:24,956
BUT THE MAIN ONE IS
TESTOSTERONE.

209
00:10:25,023 --> 00:10:26,591
SO WE'VE GOT TO
BE REAL CONCERNED

210
00:10:26,624 --> 00:10:29,294
WHEN WE SEE NEGATIVE
MESSAGES ABOUT TESTOSTERONE;

211
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,196
FOR EXAMPLE,
ANIMALS BEING NEUTERED.

212
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:36,467
OKAY, I UNDERSTAND THE
RATIONALE ABOUT TAKING A PIG

213
00:10:36,534 --> 00:10:39,837
AND LOPPING OFF HIS PRIVATE
PARTS TO FATTEN HIM UP.

214
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:41,973
YOU KNOW, THE CONCEPT
BEING HE'LL EAT MORE

215
00:10:42,006 --> 00:10:45,610
WHEN HE HAS NOTHING
BETTER TO THINK ABOUT.

216
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,280
BUT, NOW, GETTING YOUR DOG
FIXED TO MAKE HIM MORE
MANAGEABLE,

217
00:10:49,314 --> 00:10:52,250
THAT'S A
DANGEROUS PRECEDENT.

218
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,787
I'M THINKING THE ODD TIME
YOU'VE PROBABLY CHASED A CAR.

219
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,790
MAYBE BARKED AT A NEIGHBOUR.

220
00:10:58,856 --> 00:11:02,427
MIGHT'VE EVEN HAVE LEFT
A LITTLE MESS ON THE
FLOOR SOMETIMES.

221
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,996
THE LAST THING YOU WANT IS FOR
YOUR WIFE TO LOOK AT YOU

222
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:07,865
AND THEN GLANCE
OVER AT THE FRIENDLY,
MANAGEABLE FAMILY DOG

223
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:11,169
AND START GETTING
CRAZY IDEAS, HUH!

224
00:11:11,502 --> 00:11:13,071
REMEMBER,
I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

225
00:11:13,104 --> 00:11:14,772
WE'RE ALL IN THE TOGETHER.

226
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:22,080
HI, I'M WINSTON ROTHSCHILD
FROM ROTHSCHILD'S SEWAGE AND
SEPTIC SUCKING SERVICES.

227
00:11:22,146 --> 00:11:24,515
IF YOU'RE BLUSHIN'
FROM ALL THE FLUSHIN',

228
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:27,085
I'LL COME RUSHIN'
TO STOP THE GUSHIN'.

229
00:11:33,891 --> 00:11:36,260
THIS DANDRUFF FOUNDATION
IS KIND OF INTERESTING.

230
00:11:36,294 --> 00:11:38,563
STARTED BY TWO GUYS WHO
HAD SIMILAR PROBLEMS

231
00:11:38,596 --> 00:11:40,731
AND PUT THEIR
HEADS TOGETHER.

232
00:11:40,765 --> 00:11:44,402
PROBABLY A COUPLE OF FLAKES.

233
00:11:44,469 --> 00:11:47,138
RED, GOT THE CHINESE
CANDIES FOR US TO SELL!

234
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:49,006
WE GOT A DEAL
ON THEM TOO!

235
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,975
WHAT KIND OF
CANDY IS IT?

236
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:53,478
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S
A TYPE OF LICORICE.

237
00:11:53,544 --> 00:11:55,746
THEY HAVE REAL UNUSUAL
INGREDIENTS OVER THERE,

238
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,384
SO THIS IS LITTLE DIFFERENT
LICORICE THEN WE'RE USED
TO AROUND HERE.

239
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:02,420
THE COLOUR LOOKS OKAY.
HOW DOES IT TASTE?

240
00:12:02,453 --> 00:12:04,956
OH, OH.
GOOD, FINE.

241
00:12:05,022 --> 00:12:10,728
YEAH, THEY DON'T LOOK BAD.
I'VE SEEN A LOT WORSE STUFF.

242
00:12:10,761 --> 00:12:14,265
ALTHOUGH, I DON'T WORK AT THE
THE INPUT SIDE OF THINGS.

243
00:12:14,332 --> 00:12:16,968
[ LAUGHTER ]

244
00:12:20,271 --> 00:12:22,840
WELL, UH, GUYS, YOU KNOW IF
WE'RE GOING TO SELL THESE
TO THE PUBLIC,

245
00:12:22,873 --> 00:12:25,042
WE BETTER
TASTE THEM FIRST.

246
00:12:25,109 --> 00:12:27,211
YEAH, THAT MAKES SENSE.

247
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:28,980
YEAH,
WE COULD DO THAT.

248
00:12:33,284 --> 00:12:35,620
NOBODY.
TO START FIRST?
SO, WHO WANTS

249
00:12:35,653 --> 00:12:38,623
WELL, WE HAVE TO
DO IT TOGETHER.

250
00:12:38,656 --> 00:12:40,491
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.
FAIR IS FAIR.

251
00:12:40,524 --> 00:12:42,259
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY, SURE. FINE.

252
00:13:06,617 --> 00:13:10,955
THOSE ARE CHEWY.
I LIKE THEM.

253
00:13:10,988 --> 00:13:13,657
IT'S SORT OF AN
UNUSUAL FLAVOUR.

254
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:16,193
WHAT IS THAT?

255
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:18,996
IT'S A
CHINESE TASTE.

256
00:13:19,063 --> 00:13:22,399
IT'S EITHER SOY SAUCE
OR FIRECRACKERS.

257
00:13:25,302 --> 00:13:26,971
HOW MUCH DO YOU
THINK WE SHOULD
CHARGE PEOPLE

258
00:13:27,037 --> 00:13:28,439
FOR A BOX OF
THESE THINGS?

259
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:30,074
OH, WE GOT TO
GET TWO BUCKS A BOX.

260
00:13:30,107 --> 00:13:32,409
AS LONG AS WE DON'T LET
THEM TASTE THEM FIRST.

261
00:13:32,476 --> 00:13:34,311
I THINK WE'D BETTER
GO FIVE BUCKS,

262
00:13:34,345 --> 00:13:36,380
'CAUSE WE DON'T HAVE MANY
POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS,

263
00:13:36,413 --> 00:13:39,750
AND THERE'S GOING TO BE
NO REPEAT BUSINESS.

264
00:13:47,324 --> 00:13:49,560
YOU FIGURED YOU ASKED ALL
THE RIGHT QUESTIONS.

265
00:13:49,627 --> 00:13:50,995
CAN I HELP YOU
WITH ANYTHING?

266
00:13:51,028 --> 00:13:53,597
ARE YOU SURE?
YOU NEED?
IS THERE ANYTHING

267
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:56,267
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE SURE?

268
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,069
THEN, YOU MADE THE BIGGEST
MISTAKE OF YOUR LIFE.

269
00:13:59,136 --> 00:14:01,472
YOU TOOK HER AT
HER WORD.

270
00:14:01,505 --> 00:14:04,208
SEE, SHE FIGURES IT'S
OBVIOUS SHE NEEDS
SOME HELP.

271
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:06,277
YOU FIGURE, YOU ASKED,
SHE SAID NO,

272
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,878
YOU'RE OFF
THE HOOK, RIGHT?

273
00:14:07,945 --> 00:14:11,382
NOW THE THERMOSTAT
JUST WENT DOWN
25 DEGREES.

274
00:14:11,448 --> 00:14:14,818
"NO, I'M FINE," DIDN'T
MEAN, "NO, I'M FINE."

275
00:14:14,852 --> 00:14:18,255
THAT'S 'CAUSE SHE SAID
IT LIKE, "NO, I'M NOT FINE."

276
00:14:18,289 --> 00:14:21,191
SEE, SHE EXPECTS YOU TO
LISTEN TO THE WAY SHE
SAYS THE WORDS,

277
00:14:21,258 --> 00:14:23,160
NOT JUST THE WORDS.

278
00:14:23,193 --> 00:14:25,262
YOU FIGURED JUST LISTENING
WAS A BIG STEP FORWARD,

279
00:14:25,296 --> 00:14:27,197
NEVER MIND INTERPRETING.

280
00:14:27,264 --> 00:14:30,901
AND LET'S FACE IT, YOU'RE
NOT GETTING ANY MORE
SENSITIVE.

281
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:33,270
SO HERE'S A
RULE OF THUMB...

282
00:14:33,337 --> 00:14:36,106
IF SHE LOCKS HERSELF ALONE
IN THE BATHROOM WEEPING,

283
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,677
THAT MEANS SHE SAID THE EXACT
OPPOSITE OF WHAT SHE MEANT.

284
00:14:39,743 --> 00:14:44,448
SO YOUR EXCUSE HAS TO BE YOU
MEANT THE EXACT OPPOSITE
OF WHAT YOU SAID.

285
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:47,818
SEE, MEN AND WOMEN HAVE
BEEN SENDING EACH OTHER

286
00:14:47,885 --> 00:14:50,954
THAT KIND OF MISINFORMATION
SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME.

287
00:14:51,021 --> 00:14:53,257
IT'S CALLED
COMMUNICATING.

288
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,092
DON'T THANK US.

289
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,294
THAT'S WHAT
FRIENDS ARE FOR.

290
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,966
HAD A BIT OF A TENNIS MATCH
OUT BY THE LODGE THERE.

291
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:05,069
TWO AGAINST TWO.
A THREE-POINT GAME THERE.

292
00:15:05,102 --> 00:15:06,870
A LOT OF
SPORTSMANSHIP INVOLVED,

293
00:15:06,904 --> 00:15:08,705
AND DALTON'S GOING TO
BE THE UMPIRE FOR US.

294
00:15:08,739 --> 00:15:11,909
MIKE'S READY AND WALTER
CAN REALLY FIRE THAT BABY,

295
00:15:11,975 --> 00:15:14,178
AND THEN RIGHT THROUGH
AND OFF THE BACK

296
00:15:14,244 --> 00:15:15,813
AND IT'S IN, IT'S IN.

297
00:15:15,846 --> 00:15:17,314
THAT'S A POINT.
THAT'S A POINT.

298

LITTLE ARGUMENT THERE.

299

ALL RIGHT, SERVE AGAIN.
NOW, WATCH THIS.

PUT A SPIN ON A BALL.

305

THE BIG ONE'S COMING.

MAN BEHIND THE POWDER BURNS.

337
00:16:51,608 --> 00:16:53,944
EDGAR, MAYBE YOU COULD TAKE
US BACK TO THE BEGINNING,

338
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,846
WHEN YOU WERE
GROWING UP AS A KID.

339
00:16:55,912 --> 00:16:58,115
OH, YEAH. WELL, RED,

340
00:16:58,181 --> 00:17:01,785
MY FATHER WAS AN ACCOUNTANT,
AND MY MOM WAS A LIBRARIAN.

341
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:04,354
IT WAS A VERY
QUIET HOUSE,

342
00:17:04,421 --> 00:17:07,524
UP UNTIL MY
SEVENTH BIRTHDAY.

343
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:10,460
THAT'S WHEN I GOT
THE CHEMISTRY SET.

344
00:17:10,494 --> 00:17:13,296
WAS IT A
LARGE HOUSE, EDGAR?

345
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:17,134
WELL IT GOT A LITTLE
SMALLER THAT DAY.

346
00:17:17,467 --> 00:17:20,137
SO YOU STARTED EXPERIMENTING
WITH EXPLOSIVES AT A
VERY EARLY AGE.

347
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,372
I WOULD SAY SO.

348
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,541
I KIND OF LOST TRACK
OF TIME THERE.

349
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:26,243
I'D BLOW SOMETHING UP,

350
00:17:26,276 --> 00:17:29,913
AND THEN IT MIGHT TAKE A
WHILE BEFORE I REGAINED
CONSCIOUSNESS.

351
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,382
BUT I GOT RIGHT
BACK AT IT.

352
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:37,220
I WAS CURIOUS TO KNOW WHERE
THINGS GO WHEN THEY EXPLODE.

353
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:39,789
AND WHERE
DO THEY GO?

354
00:17:39,823 --> 00:17:42,425
A LONG WAY.

355
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:46,463
ONCE I FILLED MY BICYCLE
HANDLEBARS WITH DYNAMITE.

356
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:51,167
WHEN I SET THAT OFF IT BLEW MY
HORN HALFWAY TO PORT ASBESTOS.

HURT HAVING THAT KIND
OF FUN, EDGAR.

358
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:56,673
OH, I DIDN'T DO IT
FOR FUN, RED.

359
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,576
IT WAS EDUCATIONAL.

360
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:01,912
I LEARNED A LOT.

361
00:18:01,978 --> 00:18:07,083
FOR EXAMPLE, I LEARNED THAT AN
EXPLOSIVE IS VERY STRONG,

362
00:18:07,117 --> 00:18:12,055
STRONGER THAN,
SAY, A FINGER.

363
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:18,395
OH, BOY. THAT MUST
HAVE BEEN PAINFUL.

364
00:18:18,428 --> 00:18:20,897
OH, YEAH.

365
00:18:20,964 --> 00:18:24,467
THEY SAID THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN
ABLE TO REATTACH THE FINGER
AFTER THE EXPLOSION,

366
00:18:24,534 --> 00:18:27,570
BUT IT TOOK TOO
LONG TO COME DOWN.

367
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:31,908
YOU KNOW, PERSONALLY I WOULD
NEVER MESS AROUND WITH
DYNAMITE.

368

NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE
DOING, RED.

THEIR HOUSE MOVED,

371
00:18:42,052 --> 00:18:44,821
I CAN MOVE THAT UNIT
RIGHT OFF THE FOUNDATION

AND STAND IT UP ON ONE
CORNER WHILE THE
