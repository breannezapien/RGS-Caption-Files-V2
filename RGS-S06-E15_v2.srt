1
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:05,338
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

2
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:09,409
NOW, HERE'S THE MAJORDOMO
OF LIFE IN SLO-MO,

3
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:12,379
YOUR HERO, MY UNCLE, RED GREEN!

4
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:16,850
(Applause and cheering)

5
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,852
THANK YOU.

6
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:20,186
THANK YOU.

7
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:21,521
APPRECIATE IT.

8
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:23,123
THINGS ARE OUT OF WHACK

9
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,691
AT MY PLACE THIS WEEK.

10
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,526
ONE OF BERNICE'S RELATIVES

11
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:27,861
IS STAYING WITH US.

12
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:29,863
BERNICE'S SISTER'S DAUGHTER.

13
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:32,165
SHE'S 16 YEARS OLD.

14
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,033
HELLO? HI? WHAT?

15
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,535
SIXTEEN?

16
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:38,037
LIKE, A FEMALE TYPE PERSON?

17
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:40,140
YOU MET HER, HAROLD,

18
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,375
AT THE CHURCH PICNIC.

19
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,477
SHE HAD THE TACO ON HER FACE --
WITH TEENAGERS,

20
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,045
IT'S HARD TO TELL.

21
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:47,380
I DON'T
REMEMBER HER.

22
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,549
WHAT'S HER NAME?

23
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:51,050
UM...

24
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:53,186
ALICE, OR... ALYSHA...

25
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,388
WE JUST CALL HER "HORSE".

26
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:56,923
HER?

27
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,258
OH, I REMEMBER HER.

28
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,059
SHE STILL WEARING THAT BIT?

29
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,394
I MEAN BRACES.

30
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,829
YEAH, SHE'S
GONNA

31
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,230
HAVE THEM
AWHILE.

32
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:07,467
IT WILL TAKE A WHILE
TO CORRAL THOSE TEETH.

33
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:10,536
SHE'S GOT A SMILE
LIKE STONEHENGE.

34
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:12,205
SAY HELLO FOR ME.

35
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:14,908
NO, NO, NO, HAROLD,
YOU SAY HELLO YOURSELF.

36
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,010
NO WAY!
COME ON.

37
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:19,946
AUNT BERNICE SAYS
YOU HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

38
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,215
I DON'T EVEN FIND HER
ATTRACTIVE.

39
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,350
THERE'S ONE THING RIGHT THERE.

40
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:29,355
(Horns honking)

41
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,958
(Geese honking)

42
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:35,461
(Quacking)

43
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,933
(Red): YOU'RE LOOKIN'
AT SEGMENTS

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,702
FROM THIS PARTICULAR SHOW,

45
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,070
THE MAIN MESSAGE BEING,

46
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:46,706
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT CHANGING THE CHANNEL.

47
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,375
TO MAKE SENSE
OUT OF THIS PROGRAMME,

48
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,710
YOU GOTTA GIVE IT

49
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,445
YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.

50
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,956
I INTRODUCED HAROLD
TO MY WIFE'S SISTER'S DAUGHTER.

51
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,691
HE DIDN'T SAY TWO WORDS.

52
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:07,560
NEVER SEEN HIM THAT QUIET,

53
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,396
WHICH MEANT HE HAD TO RELY
ON HIS LOOKS.

54
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,898
(Audience laughing)

55
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:14,667
TRY TO IMAGINE HOW THAT WENT.

56
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:19,472
MIND YOU, HORSE ISN'T SO EASY
ON THE EYES, HERSELF.

57
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,407
(Singing)

58
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,943
(Audience laughing)

59
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,411
(Giggling)

60
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,913
YOU OK,
HAROLD?

61
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:29,515
YEAH, OH, YEAH, OH, YEAH!

62
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:31,417
SORRY YOU TWO
DIDN'T HIT IT OFF.

63
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,752
ALYSHA
ASKED ABOUT ME?

64
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,588
DID SHE SAY SHE LIKES
STRONG, SILENT TYPES?

65
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,089
DID SHE SAY THAT?

66
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:40,459
I'M JUST SAYING, DON'T WORRY
THAT YOU TWO DIDN'T TALK.

67
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:42,628
MAYBE SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO FILL THE AIR

68
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,230
WITH MEANINGLESS CHATTER.

69
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:47,533
YEAH... I DON'T WANT YOU
TO TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

70
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,570
SHE PROBABLY HAD BROCCOLI
WEDGED INTO HER BRACES.

71
00:02:50,636 --> 00:02:53,839
NO, NO, NO,
WE DID NOT HAVE TO SPEAK,

72
00:02:53,906 --> 00:02:56,108
FOR OUR EYES SAID IT ALL.

73
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,877
(Audience laughing)

74
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:00,413
THAT WOULD BE
QUITE A CONVERSATION.

75
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,648
THEY EACH HAVE FOUR OF 'EM.

76
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:04,150
NOW... NOW...

77
00:03:04,216 --> 00:03:06,586
ARE YOU SAYING
YOU ACTUALLY LIKED HER?

78
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:09,388
I'M GONNA MARRY HER!

79
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:12,825
FOR GOSH SAKES,
SHE'S ONLY 16 YEARS OLD!

80
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,394
WELL, WE'LL GO
TO MISSISSIPPI.

81
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,129
NO, COME ON, HAROLD.

82
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,898
SHE'S YOUR COUSIN, ALL RIGHT?

83
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,333
OH, RIGHT.
YEAH.

84
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:23,102
MAKE THAT ALABAMA.

85
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,137
(Laughing)

86
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:28,708
(Red): LATER ON, BILL'S
GONNA BE TRYING HIS HAND

87
00:03:28,774 --> 00:03:30,643
AT A LITTLE TARZAN ACTION.

88
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,346
YOU KNOW, SWINGING
FROM TREE TO TREE.

89
00:03:33,412 --> 00:03:35,915
RIGHT NOW,
HE'S GONNA DO A DRY RUN.

90
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:39,919
GONNA SWING FROM THAT LADDER
TO THE OTHER LADDER.

91
00:03:39,985 --> 00:03:42,688
GONNA SWING...
SWING WITH THE ROPE.

92
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:45,424
HE'S GONNA THROW
THE ROPE UP -- OW!

93
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,926
THROW THE ROPE UP,

94
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:49,895
TRY TO GET THE TOP BRANCH --
NOT BAD!

95
00:03:49,962 --> 00:03:51,330
THAT WILL PULL HIM...

96
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,099
I GUESS IT'S STRONG... OK.

97
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:54,500
UP HE GOES AND THEN

98
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,436
HE'S GONNA SHORTEN THE ROPE
AND SWING ACROSS.

99
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,805
I'M NOT SURE THAT TREE
IS AS STRONG

100
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,942
AS IT NEEDS TO BE TO HOLD
SOMEONE OF BILL'S, UH...

101
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:04,877
HOW CAN I PUT THIS DELICATELY?

102
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,212
FLAB?

103
00:04:06,278 --> 00:04:07,613
YOU KNOW, WITH BILL,

104
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,783
SOMETIMES HE DOESN'T FOCUS
ON WHAT'S IMPORTANT,

105
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,418
LIKE, SAY, HIS BALANCE.

106
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:15,821
HE PULLS THE TREE DOWN,
HITS THE LADDER-- OHHH!

107
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,190
OH! OH! OH! AND...
THERE'S THE TREE.

108
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:19,892
YEAH, MM-HMM, YEAH.

109
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,460
BIT OF A DRY RUN.

110
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,929
A FEW WRINKLES IN IT, BILL.

111
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:27,733
AND I SEEM TO HAVE PICKED UP
A BIRD'S NEST.

112
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,669
NOW HE'S WANTING ME
TO EGG HIM ON

113
00:04:30,736 --> 00:04:34,473
BUT I SAY, "HEY, BILL,
THE YOLK'S ON YOU."

114
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,344
OH, DON'T GO
IN THE BUSHES

115
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,279
THAT'S MY WARNING TO YOU

116
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,882
THERE ARE BETTER PLACES
THAN SHRUBS

117
00:04:42,948 --> 00:04:44,850
TO DO WHAT YOU WANNA DO

118
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,619
OH, DON'T GO
IN THE BUSHES

119
00:04:46,685 --> 00:04:48,420
THAT'S NOT
THE PLACE TO BE

120
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:50,756
AND IF YOU GET BITTEN
AND BADLY STUNG

121
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,358
DON'T NAME IT AFTER ME

122
00:04:52,424 --> 00:04:54,760
(Laughing)

123
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:57,463
WELCOME TO THE POSSUM LODGE
WORD GAME!

124
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:00,466
TONIGHT'S PRIZE IS TWO DAYS
WITH A HOOKER,

125
00:05:00,532 --> 00:05:02,368
FROM EDNA'S HOUSE OF RUGS!

126
00:05:02,434 --> 00:05:04,370
(Audience laughing)

127
00:05:04,436 --> 00:05:06,505
UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS

128
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:09,041
TO GET MIKE HAMAR
TO SAY THIS WORD.

129
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:12,878
CRIMINAL.

130
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:15,381
CRIMINAL.

131
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:16,882
AND GO, EH?

132
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:19,518
MIKE, SOMEONE
WHO BREAKS THE LAW.

133
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,453
COUSIN LARRY.

134
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,455
BANK ROBBER.

135
00:05:23,522 --> 00:05:25,457
UNCLE EDGAR.

136
00:05:25,524 --> 00:05:26,959
CAR THIEF.

137
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:28,894
AUNTIE THELMA.

138
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:31,363
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE GENERAL TERM

139
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,632
FOR LAW-BREAKERS.
OHHH! FAMILY.

140
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:35,634
OK, OK.

141
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:37,736
SOMEONE GOES TO JAIL,

142
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:39,805
THEY ARE...
... RAILROADED.

143
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,074
BUT THEY ARE...
VICTIMS.

144
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:44,410
INNOCENT VICTIMS!

145
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:45,878
LET'S SAY YOU'RE ARRESTED.

146
00:05:45,944 --> 00:05:47,212
I DIDN'T
DO IT.

147
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,547
NO, NO, NO,

148
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:49,948
THE COPS WOULD CALL YOU...

149
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:51,283
MIKE.

150
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,085
THEY ALL KNOW ME, RIGHT?

151
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:55,421
ALMOST OUT OF TIME.

152
00:05:55,487 --> 00:05:57,423
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE

153
00:05:57,489 --> 00:05:59,858
THE COST
OF BAIL?
OH, CRIMINAL!

154
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:03,195
(Laughing and applause)

155
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,364
THIS WEEK ON "HANDYMAN CORNER",

156
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,966
WE'RE GONNA DO A PROJECT
THAT COMBINES

157
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:11,170
TWO OF MY FAVOURITE
RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES --

158
00:06:11,236 --> 00:06:12,871
SITTING DOWN AND EATING.

159
00:06:12,938 --> 00:06:16,141
THE OTHER DAY, I WAS WATCHING
T.V., WHICH PLACED THIRD

160
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,710
IN MY SITTING-DOWN-AND-EATING
SWEEPSTAKES.

161
00:06:18,777 --> 00:06:20,445
ANYWAY, THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

162
00:06:20,512 --> 00:06:22,314
I GOT HUNGRY AND I'M THINKING,

163
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,716
"WE GOT A KITCHEN
AND IN IT IS A FRIDGE.

164
00:06:24,783 --> 00:06:26,418
"THAT FRIDGE IS ON WHEELS."

165
00:06:26,485 --> 00:06:29,521
I'M THINKING, "BOY,
WHY CAN'T I GET THAT FRIDGE

166
00:06:29,588 --> 00:06:31,356
"TO KINDA ROLL TOWARDS ME?"

167
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,092
MOOSE THOMPSON CAN DO IT
JUST BY WAITING,

168
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:37,396
'CAUSE HE TENDS TO BE
THE LOW POINT IN ANY ROOM...

169
00:06:37,462 --> 00:06:39,398
AS HE IS IN ANY CONVERSATION.

170
00:06:39,464 --> 00:06:41,833
FOR ME, I NEED
A MECHANICAL ADVANTAGE.

171
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,336
I'M THINKING, "WHY NOT USE
THE ONE THING

172
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,905
"THAT HAS ALWAYS PUT FOOD
ON MY TABLE?"

173
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:49,675
FISHING, HUH?

174
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:51,009
DEEP-SEA FISHING.

175
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:52,744
FIRST THING I GOTTA DO IS

176
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:55,847
ANCHOR THIS THING
ONTO THE CHAIR SOMEWHERE.

177
00:06:55,914 --> 00:06:57,916
I'M THINKING RIGHT ABOUT...

178
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,386
... RIGHT ABOUT THERE,
ALL RIGHT?

179
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:02,721
NOW, TO DO THAT...

180
00:07:02,788 --> 00:07:05,190
IF YOU'RE MADE OF MONEY,
YOU COULD GET

181
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:07,859
A PROPER DEEP-SEA
FISHING MOUNT THINGS

182
00:07:07,926 --> 00:07:09,361
AND PUT THAT ON THERE,

183
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:13,532
OR YOU COULD USE ONE OF THESE
WALL-FLANGE MOUNTING UNITS,

184
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:17,035
BUT THAT'S GONNA CATCH
IN THE CUFF OF YOUR PANTS

185
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:19,371
AND SPOIL THE LOOK
OF THE CHAIR.

186
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:21,373
SO, INSTEAD...

187
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,041
KEEP IT SIMPLE.

188
00:07:28,947 --> 00:07:30,382
OH...

189
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:32,951
HERE WE GO, HERE WE GO.

190
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:37,923
YOU CAN MOUNT THE FISHING ROD
IN THE CHAIR,

191
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:40,258
USING SOME KIND OF CLAMP
OR SHACKLE.

192
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:42,194
YOU COULD WELD THAT IN THERE.

193
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,831
I PREFER THE HANDYMAN'S
SECRET WEAPON, DUCT TAPE.

194
00:07:45,897 --> 00:07:47,432
I FEEL A SNACK COMIN' ON!

195
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:50,469
YOU DON'T WANT TO USE BIG HOOKS
INSIDE THE HOME.

196
00:07:50,535 --> 00:07:52,904
EVEN INSIDE THE LODGE,
IT'S A BIT IFFY.

197
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:55,674
I'D RECOMMEND YOU GO
WITH THIS TYPE OF LURE.

198
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,676
THEY'RE LEFT OVER
FROM THAT TIME

199
00:07:57,742 --> 00:07:59,811
I TRIED TO MAKE
THE HUMAN FLY OUTFIT

200
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:02,848
WHEN I WANTED TO CLIMB
THE OUTSIDE OF THE LODGE.

201
00:08:02,914 --> 00:08:06,852
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
IF THE FRIDGE ARE BITING.

202
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:08,320
(Thumping)

203
00:08:08,386 --> 00:08:10,222
OH, THAT SOUNDED GOOD.

204
00:08:10,288 --> 00:08:12,757
OH, YEAH, THINK WE GOT ONE.

205
00:08:12,824 --> 00:08:14,960
YOU GOTTA PLAY THESE IN
JUST RIGHT.

206
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:17,395
IT'S AN APPLIANCE
YOU'RE DEALING WITH.

207
00:08:17,462 --> 00:08:19,564
IF THEY WANT TO RUN,
LET THEM RUN!

208
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:20,899
GET 'ER IN HERE.

209
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:23,368
BY GOLLY, SHE'S A HUMMER!

210
00:08:23,435 --> 00:08:24,870
OH, MY GOD!

211
00:08:24,936 --> 00:08:26,371
OH, OH, OH, OH!

212
00:08:26,438 --> 00:08:29,040
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

213
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:31,243
I GUESS AIM IS IMPORTANT, TOO.

214
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:34,179
OK, SO, DON'T FORGET,
CATCH AND RELEASE.

215
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:36,948
(Audience laughing)

216
00:08:39,784 --> 00:08:41,219
HERE WE GO!

217
00:08:41,286 --> 00:08:42,654
OH, BOY!

218
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:46,057
(Grunting)

219
00:08:48,293 --> 00:08:50,161
(Grunting)

220
00:08:50,228 --> 00:08:51,730
AHHHH!

221
00:08:53,398 --> 00:08:54,666
THERE WE GO.

222
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:58,336
IT'S JUST THAT EASY,
JUST THAT DARN EASY.

223
00:08:58,403 --> 00:09:00,839
GET US A DRINK... AHHH...

224
00:09:00,905 --> 00:09:03,975
NEVER HAD TO... NEVER HAD TO
LEAVE MY CHAIR.

225
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:07,312
I THINK THIS PROJECT
IS REALLY GONNA CATCH ON.

226
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:08,680
(Thumping)

227
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:13,651
STINKY PETERSON
WANTS HIS RECLINING CHAIR BACK.

228
00:09:13,718 --> 00:09:16,321
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

229
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:18,356
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

230
00:09:18,423 --> 00:09:21,760
IF YOU GOT ANOTHER LURE,
WE CAN HITCH IN TO TOWN!

231
00:09:21,826 --> 00:09:25,930
STAY TUNED -- WHATEVER THIS IS,
WE GOT LOTS MORE OF IT.

232
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:31,970
WANT TO TALK
TO YOU MIDDLE-AGED GUYS

233
00:09:32,036 --> 00:09:35,140
WHO ARE MAYBE CONTEMPLATING
SIGNING UP FOR BASEBALL.

234
00:09:35,206 --> 00:09:36,808
IF YOU'RE ONE OF THESE GUYS

235
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,810
WHO THINKS
THEY CAN PICK UP A BAT

236
00:09:38,877 --> 00:09:40,845
AFTER 25 YEARS
OF BASIC STILLNESS,

237
00:09:40,912 --> 00:09:44,482
AND THEN SLAM A HIGH FASTBALL
OVER THE THIRD BASEMAN'S HEAD,

238
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:46,551
STRETCHING A DOUBLE
INTO A TRIPLE,

239
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:48,686
WELL, THINK AGAIN.

240
00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:50,188
(Audience laughing)

241
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:53,591
DON'T BE SURPRISED IF A HIT
AND MAKING IT TO FIRST BASE

242
00:09:53,658 --> 00:09:55,693
HAPPEN IN TWO DIFFERENT
AT-BATS...

243
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,196
MAYBE EVEN
IN TWO DIFFERENT GAMES.

244
00:09:58,263 --> 00:10:01,733
YOU'LL BE LUCKY TO STRETCH
A TRIPLE INTO A SINGLE,

245
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:06,204
AND MORE LIKELY, YOU'LL STRETCH
YOUR HAMSTRING INTO A HOSPITAL.

246
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:10,542
THE ONLY THING IN YOUR FAVOUR
IS THAT THERE'S A GUY OUT THERE

247
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:13,645
WHO LOOKS LIKE YOU,
THE SAME WEIGHT AND AGE,

248
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:16,681
HE HAS TO RUN, BEND OVER,
PICK UP THE BALL,

249
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:18,216
AND THEN THROW IT IN.

250
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:20,718
HE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
BE PLAYING, EITHER.

251
00:10:20,785 --> 00:10:22,687
IT MIGHT BE TIME TO GIVE IT UP.

252
00:10:22,754 --> 00:10:25,790
ONCE YOU HIT 40, THINK ABOUT
HANGING UP THE CLEATS.

253
00:10:25,857 --> 00:10:27,692
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ON A SLIDE

254
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,994
DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULD BE
PLAYING BASEBALL.

255
00:10:30,061 --> 00:10:31,629
YOU'RE NOT ON DECK.

256
00:10:31,696 --> 00:10:33,665
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
IN THE DAMN BOAT!

257
00:10:33,731 --> 00:10:35,667
(Audience laughing)

258
00:10:35,733 --> 00:10:37,001
SIT IN THE STANDS.

259
00:10:37,068 --> 00:10:38,536
WATCH YOUR FRIENDS PLAY.

260
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:41,272
YOU'LL HAVE A BETTER VIEW,
FRESHER HOT DOGS,

261
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:44,742
AND YOU CAN DRIVE THEM TO
THE HOSPITAL BETWEEN INNINGS.

262
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:47,011
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YA.

263
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:49,180
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

264
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:51,949
(Applause)

265
00:10:52,183 --> 00:10:53,451
WELL, HORSE -- SORRY --

266
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:56,487
ALYSHA IS STILL STAYING
WITH BERNICE AND I.

267
00:10:56,554 --> 00:11:00,625
IT'S DIFFICULT GETTING USED TO
TWO WOMEN AROUND THE HOUSE.

268
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:02,026
GO IN THE BATHROOM,

269
00:11:02,093 --> 00:11:05,196
YOU'VE GOT THEM WAFFLE IRONS
FOR YOUR HAIR.

270
00:11:05,263 --> 00:11:06,831
WHEN WE WATCH T.V.

271
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:09,367
I'M ONLY ALLOWED TO FLICK
BETWEEN FOUR CHANNELS.

272
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:10,868
THAT'S ALL I GET.

273
00:11:10,935 --> 00:11:13,871
UNCLE RED, UNCLE RED,
IS THIS TOO MUCH?!

274
00:11:13,938 --> 00:11:15,707
NO, IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

275
00:11:15,773 --> 00:11:17,375
I CAN STILL SEE YOUR FACE.

276
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:18,876
HA, HA, HA, HA.

277
00:11:18,943 --> 00:11:20,378
IT'S NOT FOR ME.

278
00:11:20,445 --> 00:11:21,846
IT'S FOR ALYSHA.

279
00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:24,148
YOU KNOW
WHY?
NO.

280
00:11:24,215 --> 00:11:25,650
NO REASON.

281
00:11:25,716 --> 00:11:29,187
IT'S MY WAY OF SAYING,
"HERE'S SOME FLOWERS."

282
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:30,721
YOU'D BETTER SLOW DOWN.

283
00:11:30,788 --> 00:11:32,590
YOU CAN SPEND TIME AND MONEY

284
00:11:32,657 --> 00:11:34,992
AND THIS MIGHT NOT BE
GOING ANYWHERE.

285
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:36,627
SHE MIGHT BE ALLERGIC.

286
00:11:36,694 --> 00:11:38,162
DON'T WORRY.

287
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:42,934
I MADE SURE THAT MY DEPOSIT ON
THE WEDDING RING IS REFUNDABLE.

288
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,669
OH, MAN, HAROLD, HAROLD, WHOA.

289
00:11:44,735 --> 00:11:46,471
BEFORE YOU GET ENGAGED,

290
00:11:46,537 --> 00:11:50,274
MAYBE YOU MIGHT WANT TO
GO OUT WITH HER ONE TIME.

291
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:52,376
YOU WANT TO FIND OUT
IF YOU LIKE HER?

292
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:54,846
TAKE HER TO SOMETHING
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO,

293
00:11:54,912 --> 00:11:56,347
AN OPERA OR BALLET

294
00:11:56,414 --> 00:11:57,849
OR ANYTHING WITH MIMES.

295
00:11:57,915 --> 00:11:59,350
OH, I
HATE MIMES.

296
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:01,285
IF YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME,

297
00:12:01,352 --> 00:12:05,156
YOU'LL KNOW
SHE'S THE WOMAN FOR YOU.

298
00:12:05,223 --> 00:12:07,825
YOU'RE SAYING,
WHEN MEN AND WOMEN DATE,

299
00:12:07,892 --> 00:12:10,194
YOU ONLY GO PLACES
THAT SHE ENJOYS.

300
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:12,363
YUP --
JUST TILL YOU'RE MARRIED.

301
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,831
(Audience laughing)

302
00:12:13,898 --> 00:12:16,767
THEN YOU DON'T GO ANYWHERE.

303
00:12:21,205 --> 00:12:24,642
UH, MY NAME IS DALTON HUMPHREY,
AND I'M A MAN.

304
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:26,143
(All): HI, DALTON.

305
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,645
HELLO, MEN.

306
00:12:27,712 --> 00:12:32,216
IT'S BEEN LESS THAN 24 HOURS
SINCE I ACTED LIKE A GUY.

307
00:12:32,283 --> 00:12:33,884
IT HAPPENED LIKE THIS.

308
00:12:33,951 --> 00:12:35,386
I WAS, UM,

309
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:38,556
WELL, THE DISHWASHER
NEEDED A LITTLE REPAIRING.

310
00:12:38,623 --> 00:12:41,993
YOU KNOW HOW THE FOOD TRAP
WILL NEED CLEANING OUT.

311
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:45,463
ALL I REALLY NEEDED
WAS A PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER,

312
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:47,431
BUT I WENT TO THE BASEMENT

313
00:12:47,498 --> 00:12:50,001
AND I GOT MY
BIG, BIG, BIG TOOL-BOX.

314
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:51,502
OH BOY.

315
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:57,174
AND IN FULL VIEW OF MY FAMILY...

316
00:12:57,241 --> 00:12:59,677
I PULLED OUT
EVERY TOOL I HAD.

317
00:12:59,744 --> 00:13:01,178
EVERY ONE.

318
00:13:01,245 --> 00:13:04,915
I HAD THEM ON THE COUNTER,
THE FLOOR, ALL OVER THE PLACE.

319
00:13:04,982 --> 00:13:06,784
AND I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU,

320
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:13,090
MEN, I HAD SO MANY TOOLS OUT,
I COULDN'T EVEN WORK.

321
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,695
AND THEN I LOOKED--

322
00:13:17,762 --> 00:13:21,398
I LOOKED UP...
INTO THE FACES OF MY FAMILY,

323
00:13:21,465 --> 00:13:24,702
MY WIFE AND MY DAUGHTER
STANDING THERE,

324
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:28,606
AND I WILL NEVER FORGET
THAT LOOK IN MY LIFE.

325
00:13:28,672 --> 00:13:30,174
I WAS--

326
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:35,045
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME, HAROLD.

327
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:40,151
I WAS SO ASHAMED...

328
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:44,722
TO BE SEEN THERE
SQUATTIN' AMONGST MY TOOLS.

329
00:13:48,058 --> 00:13:51,529
I GUESS I MUST HAVE COME TO
MY SENSES AT SOME POINT.

330
00:13:51,595 --> 00:13:56,000
I SAID TO MY WIFE,
"HONEY...

331
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:58,936
"I'VE GOT WAY
TOO MANY TOOLS OUT HERE.

332
00:13:59,003 --> 00:14:02,606
"I ONLY REALLY NEEDED
A PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER."

333
00:14:05,743 --> 00:14:11,749
THEN I PUT ALL MY TOOLS...
BACK IN THE BOX.

334
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:16,053
ALL RIGHT!

335
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,422
YEAH!

336
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:19,690
(Sobbing)

337
00:14:19,757 --> 00:14:21,525
WELL, I GUESS WE LEARNED

338
00:14:21,592 --> 00:14:24,395
YOU ONLY CARRY THE TOOLS
THAT YOU NEED,

339
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:27,398
AND ONLY BUY THE TOOLS
THAT YOU CAN USE.

340
00:14:27,464 --> 00:14:30,934
NO, WHAT WE LEARNED IS
YOU DON'T TRY FIXIN' STUFF

341
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:33,270
WHEN YOUR FAMILY
IS WATCHING YA.

342
00:14:33,337 --> 00:14:35,205
(Applause)

343
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,477
ALL RIGHT, IT'S
"ADVENTURES WITH BILL".

344
00:14:40,544 --> 00:14:42,379
THAT'S TARZAN BILL THERE.

345
00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:45,983
THAT'S A LOIN CLOTH,
BUT HE'S GOT A LOT TO LOIN.

346
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,918
OH, THAT'S VERY TASTEFUL.

347
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:49,420
THANK YOU.

348
00:14:49,486 --> 00:14:51,588
LOOK,
THERE'S ANOTHER ROPE THERE.

349
00:14:51,655 --> 00:14:55,292
ANYWAY, HE'S GONNA
SWING OFF THE TOP OF THE VAN.

350
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:56,794
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

351
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,596
ALL RIGHT, SHAKEY START,
BUT THERE HE GOES.

352
00:14:59,663 --> 00:15:01,265
GRAB THE OTHER ROPE.

353
00:15:01,331 --> 00:15:03,834
UH-OH.

354
00:15:03,901 --> 00:15:05,669
OH, FOR GOSH SAKES.

355
00:15:05,736 --> 00:15:07,171
ALL RIGHT, UH...

356
00:15:07,237 --> 00:15:10,674
I'M THINKIN' THAT MAY NOT BE
WHAT HE HAD PLANNED.

357
00:15:10,741 --> 00:15:11,842
MY MISTAKE.

358
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:14,812
WAY YOU GO --
GRAB THAT ROPE.

359
00:15:14,878 --> 00:15:17,848
HE GRABBED IT HIGHER
SO HE COULD GET...

360
00:15:17,915 --> 00:15:19,516
HE'S CLEARED THE VAN.

361
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,151
YOU'RE WAY UP THERE.

362
00:15:21,218 --> 00:15:22,853
COME ON DOWN.

363
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,288
OH BOY.

364
00:15:24,354 --> 00:15:25,856
HOT ON THE HANDS, BILL?

365
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:28,559
OH, THAT WOULD BURN
THE CALLOUSES OFF.

366
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,626
YOU ALL RIGHT?

367
00:15:29,693 --> 00:15:31,762
I GOT A FAN IN THE TRUCK.

368
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:34,131
THERE YOU GO.

369
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:35,766
THAT FEEL BETTER?

370
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,701
HEY, TEMPER, TEMPER!

371
00:15:37,768 --> 00:15:39,403
THAT'S MY FAN!

372
00:15:40,504 --> 00:15:41,905
RIGHT OVER A TREE.

373
00:15:41,972 --> 00:15:44,641
ALL RIGHT,
SO PRACTISE MAKES PAIN.

374
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:45,976
WE GOT THREE ROPES.

375
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:47,845
THAT'S THE EXTENSION CORD.

376
00:15:47,911 --> 00:15:49,746
THAT'S THE EXTENSION CORD
FROM THE FAN.

377
00:15:49,813 --> 00:15:52,282
GRAB THAT -- OH, NICE.

378
00:15:52,349 --> 00:15:54,585
THAT'S THE EXTENSION CORD!

379
00:15:54,651 --> 00:15:56,687
BILL, THAT'S THE--

380
00:15:56,753 --> 00:15:58,388
OH, OH, OH!

381
00:15:58,455 --> 00:16:00,591
HERE COMES ONE OF YOUR FANS,
BILL.

382
00:16:00,657 --> 00:16:04,194
OH BOY.

383
00:16:04,261 --> 00:16:06,530
HERE'S A QUILT OF POSSUM LODGE

384
00:16:06,597 --> 00:16:09,232
MADE BY A NICE WOMAN
FROM WYOMING.

385
00:16:13,804 --> 00:16:16,840
ALL THESE YEARS HAVING
HAROLD AROUND CONVINCED ME

386
00:16:16,907 --> 00:16:19,209
THAT I DON'T REGRET
NOT HAVING A SON.

387
00:16:19,276 --> 00:16:21,778
ALYSHA HAS ONLY BEEN WITH US
A WEEK,

388
00:16:21,845 --> 00:16:25,882
AND I ALREADY FEEL THAT WAY
ABOUT NOT HAVING A DAUGHTER.

389
00:16:25,949 --> 00:16:28,318
BERNICE HAS ME
ON MY BEST BEHAVIOUR.

390
00:16:28,385 --> 00:16:30,520
GOT TO WEAR PANTS AT BREAKFAST,

391
00:16:30,587 --> 00:16:34,391
CUTTING FOOD WITH A KNIFE
RATHER THAN MY THUMB NAIL.

392
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,892
OH, YES!

393
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:37,394
YES, YES, YES, YES!

394
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:39,396
WHO DE MAN? -- I'M DE MAN.

395
00:16:39,463 --> 00:16:40,897
YOU DE MAN?

396
00:16:40,964 --> 00:16:43,900
YOU CAN'T BE DE MAN
'CAUSE I'M DE MAN!

397
00:16:43,967 --> 00:16:45,802
I'M SMOKIN'!

398
00:16:45,869 --> 00:16:47,404
OW!

399
00:16:47,471 --> 00:16:48,905
HA HA HA!

400
00:16:48,972 --> 00:16:50,874
HOO HOO HA... HA.

401
00:16:50,941 --> 00:16:53,009
GOT YOURSELF A DATE,
DO YOU, HAROLD?

402
00:16:53,076 --> 00:16:54,511
YES, I DOES!

403
00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:56,980
I TOOK YOUR ADVICE,
EXCEPT I WAS COOL.

404
00:16:57,047 --> 00:16:59,082
I SAID "THE POSSUM LAKE PLAYERS

405
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:00,851
"ARE DOING
A DINNER THEATRE."

406
00:17:00,917 --> 00:17:03,153
THAT'S WHERE YOU GET
A SHOW AND FOOD.

407
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:07,424
LAST WEEK THEY DID
"RIGOLETTO" AND RIGATONI.

408
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:10,393
THAT'S A GOOD SHOW RIGHT THERE.

409
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,563
SO, THIS WEEK THEY'RE DOING
"CARMEN" AND CRAB.

410
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,765
I THOUGHT "THAT'S GREAT."

411
00:17:15,832 --> 00:17:18,568
I SAID "SINCE I HATE OPERA,
DO YOU WANNA GO?"

412
00:17:18,635 --> 00:17:20,070
SHE WENT "UH-HUH."

413
00:17:20,137 --> 00:17:22,873
(Giggling)

414
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:25,008
WELL, GOSH, YOU KNOW,

415
00:17:25,075 --> 00:17:27,811
IF YOU CAN SIT THROUGH THAT,
THERE MAY BE

416
00:17:27,878 --> 00:17:31,915
A TWINGE OF LOVE IN THE MIDST
OF THIS PATHETIC DESPERATION.

417
00:17:31,982 --> 00:17:35,886
BUT THERE IS A BIT OF
A WRINKLE IN THE PLAN THOUGH.

418
00:17:35,952 --> 00:17:39,890
SHE'S NOT ALLOWED TO GO ON
UNCHAPERONED DATES.

419
00:17:39,956 --> 00:17:41,424
AUNT BERNICE SAID THAT

420
00:17:41,491 --> 00:17:44,027
YOU AND HER WOULD BE HAPPY
TO JOIN US.

421
00:17:44,094 --> 00:17:45,729
FORGET IT.

422
00:17:45,795 --> 00:17:47,364
NO WAY, NO.

423
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:50,000
BERNICE DRAGGED ME TO
ONE OF THEM THINGS.

424
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:52,936
IT WAS "THE SOUND OF MUSIC"
WITH BAKED BEANS.

425
00:17:53,003 --> 00:17:56,406
(Audience laughing)

426
00:17:56,473 --> 00:17:58,141
YEAH, I HEARD THAT.

427
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,810
IT WAS ALL OVER TOWN.

428
00:18:00,877 --> 00:18:02,412
BUT IT'S TOO LATE.

429
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:05,315
I GOT FOUR TICKETS
RIGHT UP FRONT.

430
00:18:05,382 --> 00:18:07,183
YOU KNOW THE BEST PART?

431
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,852
AUNT BERNICE PAID FOR THEM.

432
00:18:08,918 --> 00:18:10,453
AHHH, GEEZ!

433
00:18:14,758 --> 00:18:18,561
WELCOME TO "AUTOBIOGRAPHY"
WHERE MEMBERS OF POSSUM LODGE

434
00:18:18,628 --> 00:18:20,864
HAVE REMEMBRANCES
OF CARS GONE BY.

435
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,365
GOT ARNIE DOGAN HERE.

436
00:18:22,432 --> 00:18:24,067
ARNIE, TELL US ABOUT

437
00:18:24,134 --> 00:18:25,869
THE FIRST CAR YOU EVER HAD.

438
00:18:25,935 --> 00:18:27,370
A VOLVO, '74.

439
00:18:27,437 --> 00:18:28,872
VERY SAFE.

440
00:18:28,938 --> 00:18:30,140
BUILT LIKE A TANK.

441
00:18:30,206 --> 00:18:32,542
EXCELLENT FOR
THE ROOFIN' BUSINESS.

442
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:35,879
YOU COULD GET 10 CASES
OF SHINGLES IN THE TRUNK.

443
00:18:35,945 --> 00:18:40,183
I GOT A CASE OF SHINGLES
IN A HOT TUB ONCE.

444
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,718
BOY, A VOLVO, ARNIE.

445
00:18:41,785 --> 00:18:45,622
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
YOU'D HAVE SOMETHING SPORTIER.

446
00:18:45,688 --> 00:18:47,123
WHEN YOU'RE FALLIN'

447
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,792
OFF A ROOF THREE TIMES A DAY,

448
00:18:48,858 --> 00:18:51,161
YOU'RE NOT LOOKING FOR
EXCITEMENT.

449
00:18:51,227 --> 00:18:52,962
NO, NO.

450
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:55,565
WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE, ARNIE,

451
00:18:55,632 --> 00:18:57,901
A TEENAGER IN A VOLVO?

452
00:18:57,967 --> 00:18:59,903
I'M THINKIN' DATES.

453
00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:01,404
OH, A LOT OF DATES.

454
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:02,906
NO KIDDIN', HUH?

455
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:05,241
OH YEAH.

456
00:19:05,308 --> 00:19:06,743
YEAH.

457
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,244
YEAH, YEAH.

458
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:12,248
YEAH, THEY'D CARRY MY CRUTCHES
AND CHANGE MY BANDAGES.

459
00:19:12,315 --> 00:19:16,920
ON A CLEAR NIGHT, WE'D CRUISE
RIGHT ON UP TO ROCK REEF POINT

460
00:19:16,986 --> 00:19:19,756
AND JUST GAZE OUT
OVER THOSE ROOF-TOPS

461
00:19:19,823 --> 00:19:23,426
TRYIN' TO SPOT WHERE
DAD AND I LEFT THE LADDER.

462
00:19:23,493 --> 00:19:27,063
SO YOU NEVER MARRIED THEN,
HUH, MR. DOGAN.

463
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,865
NO, NOT YET, HAROLD.

464
00:19:28,932 --> 00:19:30,967
I'M MARRIED TO MY WORK.

465
00:19:31,034 --> 00:19:34,470
JUST A CRUSTY ROOFER
IN A BEAT-UP VOLVO.

466
00:19:34,537 --> 00:19:37,807
MORE LIKE A BEAT-UP ROOFER
IN A RUSTY VOLVO.

467
00:19:37,874 --> 00:19:39,309
YEAH, YEAH.

468
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:42,612
YOU KNOW I WROTE A COUNTRY SONG
ABOUT THAT CAR.

469
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:44,514
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR IT?

470
00:19:44,581 --> 00:19:46,449
WE'RE A LITTLE
SHORT OF...

471
00:19:46,516 --> 00:19:47,951
TOLERANCE.

472
00:19:48,017 --> 00:19:49,452
GIMME THAT, HAROLD.

473
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:50,954
YOU BROUGHT
THE GUITAR.

474
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,455
GOOD MOVE,
HAROLD.

475
00:19:52,522 --> 00:19:54,757
I WAS HIDING THE GUITAR.

476
00:19:54,824 --> 00:19:56,960
THIS IS A SPECIAL ONE.

477
00:19:57,026 --> 00:19:59,128
HERE WE GO.

478
00:19:59,195 --> 00:20:03,066
SHE WAS MADE OF STEEL
AND NAUGAHYDE

479
00:20:03,132 --> 00:20:06,970
WITH FIVE WHEELS
COUNTIN' THE SPARE

480
00:20:07,036 --> 00:20:08,738
YOU NEVER KNEW
WHERE YOU WERE GOIN'

481
00:20:08,805 --> 00:20:10,340
YOU WERE PRETTY SURE

482
00:20:10,406 --> 00:20:14,344
YOU'D BE ABLE TO
THUMB A RIDE BACK

483
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:19,682
I REMEMBER THE NIGHT
OF THE ACCIDENT

484
00:20:19,749 --> 00:20:23,386
NOTHIN' WAS LEFT
BUT THE RADIO AERIAL

485
00:20:23,453 --> 00:20:25,922
THE DOCTORS
COULDN'T REMOVE IT

486
00:20:25,988 --> 00:20:28,891
SO NOW I WALK
WITH A LIMP

487
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:35,331
BUT I GET
OVER 200 STATIONS

488
00:20:35,398 --> 00:20:36,933
(Audience laughing)

489
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:39,469
(Applause)

490
00:20:39,535 --> 00:20:42,438
WELL, I'M SORRY,
BUT THAT IS TOO MUCH TO ASK

491
00:20:42,505 --> 00:20:43,940
OF ANY HUMAN BEING.

492
00:20:44,006 --> 00:20:46,743
THE MOST EMBARRASSING NIGHT
OF MY LIFE.

493
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:48,411
"CARMEN" IS A FAMOUS OPERA.

494
00:20:48,478 --> 00:20:51,814
IT WAS STUPID OF YOU TO GO
"WHICH ONE'S THE KARMANN GHIA?"

495
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:55,618
IT WAS A JOKE, FOR GOSH SAKE.

496
00:20:55,685 --> 00:20:58,488
OPERA VIEWERS,
THEY'RE SUCH UPTIGHT PEOPLE.

497
00:20:58,554 --> 00:21:01,624
THE WOMEN WITH
THE ZIRCONIUM HANGING OFF THEM,

498
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:03,759
THE GUYS IN THE SPORTS JACKETS,

499
00:21:03,826 --> 00:21:06,462
ALL TO WATCH
A BUNCH OF FAT GUYS OVERACT.

500
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:08,397
HEY, HEY, HEY, EASY THERE.

501
00:21:08,464 --> 00:21:10,800
IT SOUNDS A BIT LIKE OUR SHOW.

502
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:12,301
(Audience laughing)

503
00:21:12,368 --> 00:21:14,403
I'M TELLING YOU,
THAT WHOLE EVENING

504
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,105
WAS A TOTAL DISASTER.

505
00:21:16,172 --> 00:21:19,308
NOT FOR ME -- ESPECIALLY
AFTER YOU GOT THROWN OUT.

506
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:22,411
WHY WERE YOU SINGING
"THE TOREADOR SONG"?

507
00:21:22,478 --> 00:21:24,680
THEY HAD THE WORDS ALL WRONG.

508
00:21:24,747 --> 00:21:27,850
THEY LEFT OUT THE "DON'T SPIT
ON THE FLOORIE" PART.

509
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:30,253
HOW DID THE DATE TURN OUT
WITH HORSE?

510
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,754
STILL
IN LOVE?

511
00:21:31,821 --> 00:21:33,689
DON'T CALL HER HORSE!

512
00:21:33,756 --> 00:21:36,392
I WON'T TOLERATE
YOUR INSOLENCE ANY MORE.

513
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:37,894
DON'T EVEN DO IT.

514
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,395
ALL RIGHT, HAROLD.

515
00:21:39,462 --> 00:21:43,432
I WASN'T REALLY INSULTING HER
BY CALLING HER HORSE.

516
00:21:43,499 --> 00:21:46,902
I JUST MEANT, UH...
SHE'S A STABLE GIRL.

517
00:21:46,969 --> 00:21:50,039
(Audience laughing)

518
00:21:50,106 --> 00:21:51,540
I REALLY LIKE HER.

519
00:21:51,607 --> 00:21:53,776
BUT WE'VE DECIDED
WE'RE GONNA WAIT,

520
00:21:53,843 --> 00:21:57,079
SEE WHAT WE FEEL LIKE
IN A FEW YEARS.

521
00:21:57,146 --> 00:21:59,281
WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

522
00:21:59,348 --> 00:22:00,983
YOU KISS HER GOOD NIGHT?

523
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,985
HA, HA.

524
00:22:03,052 --> 00:22:04,420
GENTLEMEN DON'T TELL.

525
00:22:04,487 --> 00:22:05,921
SO NO.

526
00:22:05,988 --> 00:22:07,423
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

527
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,058
I THINK SHE WASN'T SURE

528
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:12,928
IF HER INSURANCE FOR HER BRACES
COVERED LIP PUNCTURES.

529
00:22:12,995 --> 00:22:14,764
SO...

530
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,900
BUT I'M HOPEFUL --
IT'S LIKE THEY SAY IN OPERA.

531
00:22:17,967 --> 00:22:21,170
"IT'S NOT OVER TILL THE FAT GUY
IN THE PLAID SHIRT

532
00:22:21,237 --> 00:22:23,239
"GETS THROWN OUT BY THE USHERS."

533
00:22:23,305 --> 00:22:25,207
(Squealing)

534
00:22:25,274 --> 00:22:26,709
I'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.

535
00:22:26,776 --> 00:22:28,511
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

536
00:22:28,577 --> 00:22:31,714
NOW THAT WE'VE HAD
OUR NIGHT AT THE OPERA

537
00:22:31,781 --> 00:22:35,451
I WAS HOPING WE COULD HAVE
OUR DAY AT THE RACES.

538
00:22:35,518 --> 00:22:37,119
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

539
00:22:37,186 --> 00:22:40,756
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND HAROLD AND THE GANG,

540
00:22:40,823 --> 00:22:42,925
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

541
00:22:42,992 --> 00:22:47,763
(Applause and cheering)

542
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,498
(Possum squeal)

543
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:54,270
(Harold): OK, HE'S HERE.

544
00:22:54,336 --> 00:22:55,838
SIT DOWN.

545
00:22:55,905 --> 00:22:58,374
OK, STAND UP.

546
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,043
(Red): ALL RIGHT.

547
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:05,381
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

548
00:23:05,447 --> 00:23:09,018
(Harold): THE PEOPLE WHO
ORGANIZE THE STRAWBERRY SOCIAL

549
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:12,021
WANT TO CHANGE
THE ORDER OF EVENTS THIS YEAR.

550
00:23:12,087 --> 00:23:15,758
THEY'D LIKE TO HAVE THE DANCE
AND THEN THE STREET BRAWL.

551
00:23:15,824 --> 00:23:17,860
SO, SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT.
