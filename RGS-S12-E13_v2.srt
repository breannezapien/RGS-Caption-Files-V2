1
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:05,438
BUT, YOU KNOW, PROGRESS
ISN'T ALWAYS A BAD THING.

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:08,875
FOR EXAMPLE, THEY HAVE THAT
E-MAIL, ON THE INTERNET NOW,

3
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:10,610
WHERE YOU CAN KEEP IN
TOUCH WITH LOVED ONES

4
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:13,613
WITHOUT HAVING TO
BLOW 50 CENTS ON A STAMP.

5
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:15,782
AND THE BEST THING I
LIKE ABOUT E-MAIL IS THAT

6
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:19,052
YOU HAVE A FILTER ON THERE SO
YOU CAN KEEP JUNK MAIL OUT.

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,187
SO I'M THINKING
WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT

8
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:23,089
TO HAVE THAT KIND OF A
FILTER ON YOUR NORMAL MAIL,

9
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:25,325
SOMETHING THAT WOULD ALLOW
THE GOVERNMENT CHEQUES
TO COME IN,

10
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:26,926
BUT WOULD FILTER
OUT THE FLYERS

11
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:29,896
TRYING TO SELL ME
A TIMESHARE IN AFGHANISTAN?

12
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,965
SO HERE'S WHAT I'VE
COME UP WITH...

13
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:33,666
TO HELP SORT
THE REGULAR MAIL

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,668
I'VE GOT A BELT SANDER
LYING ON ITS SIDE.

15
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,237
IT TAKES UP A
FAIR BIT OF ROOM,

16
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:39,706
WHICH MEANS ALL MY INCOMING
MAIL HAS TO STAY VERTICAL,

17
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,674
WHICH IS IMPORTANT,

18
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:44,010
BECAUSE BACK HERE
I'VE MADE A SECOND DOOR,

19
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:47,013
BUT IT'S ONLY AS
HIGH AS YOUR STANDARD
LETTER-SIZE ENVELOPE.

20
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,149
SEE, JUNK MAIL
TENDS TO BE LARGER.

21
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,885
I GUESS SO THEY CAN PUT
PICTURES OF BIG THINGS ON IT,

22
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,988
LIKE AMPHIBIOUS CARS
OR MOBILE HOMES

23
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,290
OR ED McMAHON'S HEAD.

24
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:58,992
SO NOW ALL I GOT TO DO

25
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,628
IS TURN ON MY BELT SANDER
TO RECEIVE MY MAIL.

26
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:02,996
INCOMING.

27
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,439
OKAY, AND NOW TO GET
RID OF MY JUNK MAIL,

28
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:15,208
ALL I GOT TO DO IS HIT THE
REVERSE SWITCH ON THE
BELT SANDER.

29
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,976
BE SURE TO RECYCLE.

30
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:32,492
[cheers and applause]

31
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,863
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

32
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,865
THANK YOU.

33
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:40,567
APPRECIATE THAT.

34
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,368
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

35
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,137
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

36
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,139
EVEN THE GUYS AT THE LODGE
ARE REAL EXCITED THIS WEEK.

37
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,674
YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE
WHEN YOU TALK TO THEM,

38
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,976
THEY DON'T FALL
ASLEEP AS FAST.

39
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,412
HAROLD HAS REALLY
DONE IT THIS TIME.

40
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,915
HE'S LOCKED UP A CONTRACT
WITH THE U.S. ARMED FORCES

41
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,586
TO USE POSSUM LODGE AS PART
OF THEIR TRAINING CENTRE.

42
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,688
APPARENTLY THEY
LIKE COMING TO PLACES

43
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:04,591
THAT ARE ALREADY
ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS.

44
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,594
UNCLE RED!

45
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,164
[cheers and applause]

46
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:13,700
THEY'LL LIKE
ANYTHING, HAROLD.

47
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,469
I GOT YOUR GIFT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

48
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,404
HAROLD, IT WAS THE
LEAST I COULD DO.

49
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,974
I KNOW.
WHAT IS IT?

50
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,076
WELL IT'S A
FISHING LURE.

51
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:27,280
IT'S FOR CATCHING BASS.
IT'S CALLED A BASS-ACKWARDS.

52
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,582
IT'S GOT A LEAD SINKER
RIGHT INSIDE THERE.

53
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,284
YOU CAN CATCH ANYTHING
NEAR THE BOTTOM WITH IT.

54
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,619
WOW!

55
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:34,454
THAT'S -- THAT'S... OKAY.

56
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,422
NO PROBLEM.
THANK YOU.

57
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,825
SO WHEN ARE YOU
EXPECTING THE TROOPS TO
COME ROLLING IN, HAROLD?

58
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:41,327
WHEN DO WE SEE THE TANKS
AND THE ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS

59
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,862
COME THUNDERING DOWN THE --

60
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,597
[laughing]

61
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,000
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

62
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,068
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE
ARMY CAMP FROM THE STATES.

63
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,670
THE THING YOU BOOKED.

64
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,906
I DIDN'T BOOK ANY ARMY
CAMP FROM THE STATES.

65
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:56,075
I BOOKED THE BOY SCOUTS
FROM ST. CATHARINES.

66
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:58,311
BOY SCOUTS?

67
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,681
YOU MEAN WE'RE NOT
GETTING COLIN POWELL'S MEN?

68
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:05,084
NO. WE'RE GETTING
BADEN-POWELL'S BOYS.

69
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,522
WHY WOULD BOY SCOUTS WANT
TO COME TO POSSUM LODGE?

70
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,491
WELL, THEY VOLUNTEERED TO
HELP CLEAN UP AROUND HERE.

71
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,226
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEY'VE ALSO VOLUNTEERED

72
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,061
TO HELP TEACH YOU GUYS TO
SURVIVE IN THE OUTDOORS,

73
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,331
'CAUSE WHAT YOU DON'T
KNOW CAN HURT YOU.

74
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,801
WHAT I DO KNOW
CAN HURT YOU, HAROLD.

75
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,404
ALL RIGHT,
LOOK HERE. LOOK HERE.

76
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,139
THESE ARE SIGNAL
FLAGS, RIGHT?

77
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,408
SO...

78
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,912
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

79
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,215
THE HOCKEY GAME'S ON.
IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK.

80
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,253
SEE, YOU GOT THINGS TO
LEARN, EVEN AT YOUR AGE.

81
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:43,056
BUT ANYWAY, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH FOR THE LURE.

82
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:44,157
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

83
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,325
VERY KIND OF YOU.

84
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,627
AH! OW! OH!

85
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,330
I TOLD YOU IT'D CATCH
ANYTHING NEAR THE
BOTTOM, HAROLD.

86
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,407
IT'S TIME FOR THE
POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

87
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:05,845
[cheers and applause]

88
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:12,619
TONIGHT'S WINNER RECEIVES
THIS COUPON FOR A MILLION...

89
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,754
COUPONS.

90
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:17,357
BUT IF YOU HAVE A FIREPLACE,
ALL THE COUPONS ARE FLAMMABLE.

91
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,026
AND ALL THE COUPONS
ARE STAPLE FREE,

92
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:23,663
SO THEY MAKE AN EXCELLENT
BATHROOM ACCESSORY.

93
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,798
OKAY, COVER YOUR EARS, MIKE.

94
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,701
RED, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS TO
GET MIKE TO SAY THIS WORD...

95
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,906
YEAH, OKAY, WINSTON.

96
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,308
AND... GO!

97
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:37,243
ALL RIGHT, MIKE, THIS IS KIND
OF AN OLD-FASHIONED WORD.

98
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,978
PEOPLE DON'T SAY
IT ANYMORE.

99
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,947
PLEASE.

100
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:42,682
OKAY. OKAY.

101
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:44,951
WHAT DO YOU CALL
A REALLY BIG PIANO?

102
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,020
HARD TO STEAL.

103
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,055
NO. OKAY.

104
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:53,459
SOMETHING THAT'S IMPRESSIVE,
IMPOSING AND SUBSTANTIAL

105
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,028
IS SAID TO BE...

106
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,563
PAMELA ANDERSON.

107
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,235
OKAY, THINK OF YOUR
OWN FAMILY, OKAY?

108
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:05,071
IN RELATION TO YOU,
YOUR FATHER'S FATHER IS...

109
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,108
ANYBODY'S GUESS.

110
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,779
OKAY, RED, YOU'RE ALMOST
OUT OF TIME HERE.

111
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:13,880
I KNOW. I KNOW.

112
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:16,149
OKAY, MIKE, THIS IS
ANOTHER WORD FOR $1,000.

113
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,384
A BRIBE.

114
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,053
BUT THIS IS
NOT A BRIBE.

115
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,587
WELL, THAT'S WHAT I SAID,

116
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,222
BUT THE GRAND JURY WOULDN'T
GO ALONG WITH IT.

117
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,324
THERE YOU GO!

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
 
COMBINE THE RAW POWER

129
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,237
MY WIFE BERNICE BOUGHT
SOME NEW FURNITURE,

130
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,206
BUT INSTEAD OF GETTING
A FULL-SIZE COUCH,

131
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:14,741
SHE GOT THIS LOVE SEAT.

132
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,142
I'M NOT HAPPY.

133
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,977
OH, SURE,
LOVE SEATS ARE FINE

134
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,179
FOR LADIES SITTING
THERE WATCHING OPRAH.

135
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,814
BUT A MAN ON A LOVE SEAT

136
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,050
IS KIND OF LIKE
RIDING SIDE SADDLE.

137
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,451
I NEED MY SPACE.

138
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,320
I NEED ROOM TO STRETCH OUT.

139
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:30,123
SO I NEED TO FIND A WAY TO
HAVE A LOVE SEAT FOR BERNICE

140
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:33,359
THAT WILL ALSO DOUBLE AS A
FULL-SIZE COUCH FOR ME.

141
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,027
AND THAT'S
TODAY'S PROJECT,

142
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,963
RIGHT HERE ON
HANDYMAN CORNER.

143
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,832
HERE'S A SMALL GLIMPSE INTO
THE WORLD OF INSPIRATION

144
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,935
AND HOW IT CAN ENTER YOUR
LIFE IF YOU'RE ONE
OF THE GIFTED.

145
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,604
SEE HOW THIS WORKS?

146
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,639
THIS IS AN
EXTENSION LADDER.

147
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,909
SO I'M THINKING, WITH THIS
SECOND UNIT RIGHT HERE,

148
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,844
WE CAN MAKE AN
EXTENSION LOVE SEAT.

149
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,748
OKAY, NOW, THE EXTENSION
LOVE SEAT WORKS

150
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,017
ON EXACTLY THE SAME PRINCIPLE
AS THE EXTENSION LADDER,

151
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,719
EXCEPT WITH
A LOT LESS ALUMINUM.

152
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:02,889
BOTTOM LINE: ONE PART'S
GOTTA FIT INSIDE THE OTHER.

153
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,191
SO WHAT I'M GOING
TO DO IS LOP OFF

154
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,293
THE RIGHT SIDE OF
BERNICE'S LOVE SEAT HERE.

155
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,362
WELL, ACTUALLY IT'S MY LEFT;
IT'S YOUR RIGHT.

156
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,863
IT'S STAGE LEFT --
CAMERA ---

157
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,032
OKAY, THIS END RIGHT HERE.

158
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,781
OKAY, NOW, TO MAKE
THIS WORK RIGHT,

159
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,783
YOU GOTTA HAUL
MOST OF THE STUFFING

160
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,085
OUT OF THE BACK AND THE
SEAT OF THE MAIN UNIT.

161
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,794
OKAY.

162
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,963
REALLY STARTING
TO TAKE SHAPE, ISN'T SHE?

163
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,934
NOW MY SMALLER LOVE SEAT CAN
SLIDE INTO AND OUT OF
THE EXISTING UNIT.

164
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,404
THE BIG QUESTION IS,
HOW DO WE GET IT TO SLIDE?

165
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,307
AND THE BIG ANSWER
RIGHT OVER HERE.

166
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:56,509
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN GET THESE
CARTS AT ANY GROCERY STORE.

167
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,211
THEY ONLY
COST A QUARTER.

168
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,112
I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY CAN
AFFORD TO STAY IN BUSINESS.

169
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,451
OKAY, I GOT THE
GROCERY CART WHEELS

170
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,753
MOUNTED ON THE BOTTOM OF
MY SECOND LOVE SEAT,

171
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,755
AND I ROLLED
HER INTO PLACE.

172
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:13,226
I TELL YOU, BERNICE IS GOING
TO FLIP OUT WHEN SHE
SEES THIS BABY.

173
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,994
YOU SEE, NOW IT'S
A LOVE SEAT,

174
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,996
WHERE SHE CAN SIT AND
DO HER NEEDLEPOINT

175
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,898
AND TELL ME WHAT
A GREAT GUY HER DAD IS.

176
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,700
BUT WHEN IT'S MY TURN,

177
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,535
I GET TO PUT MY FEET UP
AND STRETCH OUT.

178
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:25,304
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

179
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,273
THEY SHOULD AT
LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

180
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,808
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

181
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:32,111
A MAN'S GOT TO DO
WHAT A MAN'S GOT TO DO.

182
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,882
[applause]

183
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,253
[quirky upbeat music]

184
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,590
YOU PROBABLY HEARD THEM SAY
THAT TO ERR IS HUMAN,

185
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,460
BUT TO REALLY MESS UP
YOU NEED A COMPUTER.

186
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:51,097
I'M ACTUALLY OLD ENOUGH TO
REMEMBER THE YEARS B.C...

187
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,533
BEFORE COMPUTERS.

188
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,903
BACK THEN THE ONLY USE FOR
SILICON WE KNEW ABOUT

189
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:59,772
WAS FROM LOOKING AT
PICTURES OF PIN-UP GIRLS,

190
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:04,510
WHICH WAS ALSO
OUR INTRODUCTION TO THE
CONCEPT OF VIRTUAL REALITY.

191
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:08,414
LIFE WAS A LOT SIMPLER
WHEN "BOOT UP" AND "LOG ON"

192
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:12,451
WAS SOMETHING YOU DID WHEN
YOU WANTED TO WARM YOUR
FEET BY THE FIRE.

193
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:14,620
SEE, COMPUTERS WERE
IN THEIR INFANCY THEN,

194
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:17,757
AND, LIKE ALL INFANTS, THEY
EVENTUALLY GROW UP TO
BE TEENAGERS

195
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,026
AND THEN TAKE
OVER YOUR LIFE.

196
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,894
AND IN THE
LAST FEW DECADES,

197
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,629
COMPUTERS HAVE
SLOWLY BUT SURELY

198
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,299
TAKEN OVER EVERY
ASPECT OF OUR EXISTENCE.

199
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,967
AND THERE HAVE BEEN
A BUNCH OF US

200
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,602
WHO HAVE FOUGHT IT
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY

201
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,671
FROM PUNCH CARDS TO P.C.s.

202
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,573
WELL, I SALUTE THE EFFORT,

203
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,575
BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
THE BATTLE IS OVER

204
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,944
AND WE LOST, BABY.

205
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,080
WE LOST BIG TIME.

206
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,583
THE PALM PILOTS
HAVE LANDED.

207
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:47,386
LAY DOWN YOUR ARMS AND GET
CARPEL-TUNNEL SYNDROME
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

208
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,723
THE ENEMY IS
AT THE GATES.

209
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:54,226
HECK, THE ENEMY MAY
EVEN BE NAMED GATES.

210
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:55,795
REMEMBER, I PULLING FOR YOU.

211
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,663
WE'RE ALL IN
THIS TOGETHER.

212
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,936
IF YOU'VE GOT A SEPTIC
THAT SPUTTERS AND SPRAYS;

213
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,739
IF IT SMELLS LIKE CATTLE
THAT'VE BEEN ROUND TO GRAZE;

214
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,241
ROTHSCHILD'S WILL FIND YOUR
HOUSE THROUGH THE HAZE.

215
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,877
WE COME IN A TRUCK
AND LEAVE IN A DAZE.

216
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,319
WELL, THE BOY SCOUTS
ARE ALL HERE.

217
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,855
ABOUT 100 OF THEM WANDERING
AROUND THE LODGE,

218
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,424
TELLING US EVERYTHING
WE'RE DOING WRONG.

219
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,995
IT'S A DREAM COME TRUE.

220
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:33,633
[whistles and applause]

221
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:40,506
YOU ALL SET?

222
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:41,774
YEAH,
I THINK SO.

223
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:42,908
OKAY!

224
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,543
OKAY!
C'MON IN, BOBBY.

225
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,080
THIS IS YOUR
TABLE RIGHT HERE.

226
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,449
OKAY, IF THE CONTESTANTS
ARE ALL SET AND READY
TO PLAY --

227
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:51,851
GET ON WITH IT,
HAROLD.

228
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:53,252
OKAY. OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

229
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,258
MEMORY IS A VERY IMPORTANT
SURVIVAL TOOL, ALL RIGHT?

230
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,728
SO OUR FIRST EVENT WILL BE
A MEMORY CHALLENGE.

231
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,764
ALL RIGHT,
UNCLE RED, BOBBY,

232
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,533
YOU HAVE TEN SECONDS TO
MEMORIZE EVERYTHING
ON THIS BOARD.

233
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:13,873
TIME'S UP.

234
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,042
OKAY. UNCLE
RED, YOU GO FIRST.

235
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,577
ALL RIGHT, UH,

236
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:22,181
I BELIEVE THERE WAS A
PICTURE OF A YOUNG LADY.

237
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,750
AND, UH...

238
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,952
A BIKINI.

239
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:31,023
AND THEN THERE WAS...

240
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,092
A PINK BIKINI,
I THINK IT WAS.

241
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,262
VERY GOOD.
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

242
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,032
BOBBY.

243
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:43,202
A COMPASS,
A FISHING LURE,

244
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:46,072
A PAIR OF SCISSORS, A KNIFE,

245
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:48,974
A COMB, A WHISTLE

246
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,577
AND A GIRL
IN A BATHING SUIT,

247
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,080
AND I THINK HER NAME
WAS JENNIFER ENGLAND.

248
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,282
YES!
OH, VERY GOOD!

249
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:03,222
YES. THE SCORE NOW IS
FIVE POINTS FOR BOBBY,

250
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,458
ONE FOR UNCLE RED.

251
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:06,992
NO, NO, NO,
I SHOULD GET TWO,

252
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,628
BECAUSE I GOT THE MODEL
AND THE BIKINI.

253
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:12,932
ALL RIGHT.
ONE.

254
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,000
ALL RIGHT, OUR NEXT EVENT,
WHAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO,

255
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,602
YOU'VE GOT TWO PIECES OF
ROPE ON YOUR TABLE.

256
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,938
PLEASE TIE THEM
INTO A REEF KNOT.

257
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,239
AND GO.

258
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,444
[HAROLD hums
theme to
 jeopardy]
 

259
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:31,117
OH, EXCELLENT!
YES. VERY GOOD.
ALL RIGHT.

260
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,219
BOBBY HAS A REEF KNOT
AND SIX POINTS.

261
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,054
UNCLE RED?

262
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:39,458
[laughter and applause]

263
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:49,068
UNCLE RED HAS ONE POINT
AND A BALL OF TWINE.

264
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,003
ALL RIGHT, OUR NEXT
EVENT WILL BE,

265
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,738
I WANT YOU
TO START A FIRE,

266
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,241
BUT ONLY USING THE WOOD
THAT IS ON YOUR TABLE.

267
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:56,408
AND BEGIN!

268
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,417
[applause begins]

269
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:09,255
NO. NO. NO. NO. NO!

270
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,825
JUST WAIT A MINUTE.
THIS IS RED GREEN.

271
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,162
YEAH. YEAH.

272
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,967
WELL, HAROLD, THIS IS
NOT IMPORTANT ANYWAY.

273
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,302
IF YOU WANT
A REAL COMPETITION,

274
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,472
LET'S HAVE IT OUT IN THE
BUSH WHERE IT COUNTS, OKAY?

275
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:27,940
THE MEN OF
POSSUM LODGE

276
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,276
CHALLENGE YOU BOYS SCOUTS
TO A RACE, OKAY,

277
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:34,547
FROM THE LODGE UP TO
ROCK REEF POINT AND BACK.

278
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,848
NO BOATS,
NO VEHICLES,

279
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,617
NO SHOOTING GUYS
OUT OF CANNONS.

280
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,686
JUST, YOU KNOW, COMPASSES
AND A POCKET KNIFE.

281
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:41,921
THAT'S IT!

282
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:42,955
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S FINE.

283
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,156
THEN WE ACCEPT
YOUR CHALLENGE.

284
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:47,092
BOBBY, GO TELL
THE OTHERS.

285
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,530
WE'RE GOING TO BEAT
YOU SO BAD.

286
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,367
WHICH WAS IS
ROCK REEF POINT?

287
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,670
JUST FOLLOW US,
HAROLD.

288
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,577
Red:
WALTER AND I NEEDED 
TO SPLIT UP SOME WOOD. 

289
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:06,345
THE WEATHER WAS GETTING 
A LITTLE COLDER, SO --
 
 

290
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,781
WE JUST HAD THE ONE AXE, 
SO WE'D KIND OF TAKE 
TURNS ON THERE. 

291
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,082
SO I SAID, 
I'LL GO FIRST. 

292
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,217
THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT. 

293
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,952
YOU JUST COME DOWN, 
THERE'S YOUR SPLIT.
 

294
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,420
AND NOW WALTER'S TURN. 

295
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,555
WALTER, HE'S A MUSCULAR 
YOUNG FELLOW.
 

296
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,557
BUT HE DIDN'T NOTICE THIS 
ONE HAD A FEW EXTRA
 
KNOTS IN THERE.

297
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:21,560
SO WHEN IT WENT IN, BOY, 
SHE STUCK RIGHT IN THERE.
 

298
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,362
AND COULDN'T GET IT OUT, 
AND NOW WHAT DO YOU DO?
 

299
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:24,763
AND HE'S TRYING 
TO HORSE HER OUT
 

300
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,765
AND I'M THINKING, THERE'S 
TWO WAYS TO GO WITH AN AXE...
 

301
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:28,667
IF IT WON'T COME OUT, YOU GOT 
TO DRIVE IT FARTHER IN.
 

302
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,069
SO I GET THE SLEDGE HAMMER. 

303
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,371
NOW, HOLD HER LOOSE, WALTER, 
DON'T HOLD IT TIGHT. 

304
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,708
THAT'S GOTTA -- 
THERE'S A LOT OF --
 

305
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,910
THOSE ARE NOT GOOD 
VIBRATIONS. 

306
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:39,912
SO I THOUGHT IF YOU CAN'T 
GET THE AXE OFF THE LOG,
 

307
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,513
WHY DON'T YOU PULL 
THE LOG OFF THE AXE. 

308
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,716
SO I DUCT TAPED THE AXE 
HANDLE TO THE TREE,
 

309
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:45,351
AND I WRAPPED THE 
CHAIN AROUND THE LOG.
 

310
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,120
SO THE IDEA, JUST PUT THAT 
AROUND THE HITCH THERE, 

311
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,022
AND I COULD JUST 
PULL HER  OFF --
 

312
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,191
PULL THE LOG RIGHT 
OFF THE AXE. 

313
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,394
UNFORTUNATELY, I PROBABLY 
SHOULD HAVE TIED THE
 
KNOT ON THE HITCH,

314
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,997
AND WALTER NOTICED THAT THE 
CHAIN WAS ACTUALLY
 

315
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,032
STARTING TO SLIP 
NOW ON THE BALL.
 

316
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,867
AND HE RAN OUT 
TO KIND OF FIX THAT
 

317
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:04,370
SO IT WOULDN'T JUST COME
IGHT OFF AND GO LOOSE.

318
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,438
AND HE GOT HER SNUGGED UP 
JUST IN TIME AND
 

319
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,307
AND WHAT HAPPENED THERE -- 
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT -- 

320
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:09,842
THE DUCT TAPE LET GO. 

321
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,311
AND COMING RIGHT 
AT ME -- OH! 

322
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:15,214
AND BY GOLLY, HE'S AWAY. 

323
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,449
SO I TURN AROUND AND 
I SPOT HIM, BUT TOO LATE.
 

324
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:20,819
HE DID A KIND OF 
CRACK THE WHIP THING,
 

325
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:23,389
AND HE WENT 
RIGHT UP A TREE. 

326
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,224
SO I FIGURE I'D PULL HIM 
DOWN WITH THE CHAIN,  

327
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,558
BUT JUST THE CHAIN 
CAME DOWN. 

328
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,395
OH, THERE HE IS. 
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
 

329
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,997
AND NOW, OF COURSE, 
THE AXE IS STARTING TO 
COME OUT OF THE LOG 

330
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,667
AND... OH, BOY. 
THAT'S GOTTA HURT. 

331
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,536
AND HERE COMES THE LOG, 

332
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,505
AND WE GOT HER SPLIT! 

333
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:42,007
[applause]

334
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,647
[quirky upbeat music]

335
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,186
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM
THESE DAYS

336
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,355
SAYS THAT SIZE
DOESN'T MATTER.

337
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,357
WELL, IF THERE'S TWO
WORDS I DON'T RELATE TO,
 

338
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,193
IT'S CONVENTIONAL
AND WISDOM.

339
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:04,263
SO FOR GUYS LIKE ME,
SIZE DOES MATTER,

340
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,698
IN CARS, HOUSES,

341
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,766
TELEVISIONS

342
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,768
AND YES, EVEN WAFFLES.

343
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:49,808
... FIVE, SIX, SEVEN,
EIGHT, NINE, TEN.

344
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,489
OKAY.

345
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,258
ALL WE NEED TO ADD
NOW IS THE MAPLE SYRUP.

346
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:10,129
FOR OUR CLIMATE,
I RECOMMEND...

347
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,698
10-W-30.

348
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,042
IT'S TIME FOR THE EXPERTS
PORTION OF THE SHOW,

349
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,977
WHERE WE EXPLORE
THOSE THREE LITTLE WORDS

350
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,645
MEN FIND SO HARD TO SAY...

351
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,214
audience: I DON'T KNOW! 

352
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,816
THAT'S RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
 

353
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:31,950
TODAY'S LETTER READS
AS FOLLOWS...

354
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:33,552
"DEAR EXPERTS,

355
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,821
"I AM REALLY BUGGED
BY MY NEIGHBOURS.

356
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:37,923
"THEY MAKE NOISE
NIGHT AND DAY,

357
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,691
"AND THEY'RE ALWAYS
HAVING LOUD ARGUMENTS.

358
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:42,027
"THEY DON'T CLEAN THEIR YARD
OR EVEN CUT THE GRASS

359
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,763
"AND NOW THEY'RE SELLING CAR
PARTS ON THE FRONT LAWN.

360
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,265
"WHAT CAN I DO?"

361
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,400
WELL, I THINK WE'VE GOT TO
ASK OURSELVES TWO QUESTIONS.

362
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,235
FIRST OF ALL, WHAT EXACTLY
ARE THE CAR PARTS?

363
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,171
AND WHAT DOES THE GUY
WANT FOR THEM?

364
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,107
HE DOESN'T SAY.

365
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,309
WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU CAN DO ABOUT
THE NOISE,

366
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,778
AND AS FOR THE ARGUMENTS,
YOU KNOW, I SAY
LET THEM BE.

367
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:03,015
SURE, ARGUMENTS
CAN BE THERAPEUTIC.

368
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:07,519
ARGUING IS ABOUT THE ONLY
COMMUNICATION I HAVE
WITH ANN MARIE.

369
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,922
YOU KNOW, EXCEPT FOR
THE APOLOGIZING

370
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,357
AND THEN THE BEGGING

371
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:16,061
AND THE TALKING TO
MYSELF IN THE GARAGE.

372
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,731
YOU KNOW, I THINK OUR
LETTER WRITER NEEDS TO
TAKE A MATURE APPROACH
 

373
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,534
AND JUST SIMPLY CALL THE
NEIGHBOUR AND ASK HIM NICELY

374
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,736
IF HE WOULD MIND BEING A
LITTLE MORE THOUGHTFUL.

375
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,872
WELL, I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU
GUYS AT ALL ON THIS ONE.

376
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,109
I THINK A MAN FIGHTS
FIRE WITH FIRE ON THAT.

377
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,944
I MEAN, IF HE'S LETTING HIS
LAWN GO FOR THREE WEEKS,

378
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,813
YOU LET YOURS GO
FOR SIX WEEKS.

379
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,582
IF HE'S GOT
CHAIN SAWS RUNNING,

380
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,717
YOU RENT A PILE DRIVER.

381
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,285
IF HE'S PARKING
ON HIS LAWN,

382
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,888
GET YOURSELF A SCHOOL BUS
WITH THE KIDS STILL IN IT.

383
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,625
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
THAT, RED.

384
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:48,627
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
YOU CAN BE A LITTLE
CONFRONTATIONAL.

385
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,162
EVERYONE GETS
THEIR BACK UP.

386
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:53,398
I'M IN THE SEWAGE BUSINESS,
AND I KNOW WHAT A BACKUP IS.

387
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,367
IT'S LIKE A SEPTIC TANK.

388
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,002
YOU WANT TO RELIEVE
THE PRESSURE,

389
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,871
NOT INCREASE THE PRESSURE,

390
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,539
'CAUSE ONE DAY SHE'LL BLOW,

391
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,541
AND THEN EVERYBODY'S GOT
EGG ON THEIR FACE.

392
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,710
YOU KNOW, IT DEPENDS
WHO YOU TALK TO.

393
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,980
SOME PEOPLE ARE REASONABLE
AND OPEN TO CHANGE.

394
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:10,582
I'VE NEVER MET HIM.

395
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,251
SOUNDS LIKE THIS
GUY'S NEIGHBOUR

396
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,319
COULD BE PRETTY
SET IN HIS WAYS.

397
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,021
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I WOULD DO.

398
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:17,923
I WOULD GET SOME OF
THOSE GREEN GARBAGE BAGS,

399
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,858
AND I WOULD PUT ALL
OF MY JUNK INTO THEM,

400
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:20,993
ALL MY GARBAGE
AND EVERYTHING.

401
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,694
AND I'D GO UP ON THE
ROOF OF MY PLACE

402
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,997
AND JUST PITCH 'EM RIGHT
THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF
THAT GUY'S PLACE.

403
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,865
THAT'D WAKE HIM UP.

404
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,501
RED, THE GUY'D PROBABLY
GO TO JAIL FOR THAT.

405
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:32,237
AND HE AIN'T GONNA LIKE
HIS NEIGHBOURS THERE.

406
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,339
WELL, YOU KNOW, WINSTON,
MAYBE SO IN THE CITY,

407
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,208
BUT IN THE COUNTRY YOU'D
PROBABLY GET AWAY WITH IT.

408
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,910
WHERE DOES THE
GUY LIVE, ANYWAY?

409
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:40,312
OH, THERE'S
NO RETURN ADDRESS.

410
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,047
LOCAL POSTMARK,
THOUGH.

411
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:51,623
[laughter and applause]

412
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,929
[applause]

413
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,597
OH, YES! OH, YES!

414
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,466
I GUESS YOU CAN TELL WHO WON
THE RACE TO ROCK REEF POINT.

415
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:04,870
I'M GOOD, HAROLD.

416
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,371
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

417
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,407
YOU BROUGHT THIS ON
YOURSELF, UNCLE RED.

418
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:09,908
HEY, I GOT LUCKY.

419
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,844
THEY KEPT WITH OTHER GUYS
THERE FOR OBSERVATION.

420
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,513
I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING, HAROLD.

421
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,215
YOU KNOW, TECHNICALLY,
WE WON THE RACE.

422
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,483
WE WERE BACK TO THE LODGE
BEFORE YOU GUYS WERE.

423
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,987
YOU WERE IN AN
AMBULANCE.

424
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,989
YOU GUYS ARE JUST TOO
OLD AND OUT OF SHAPE

425
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,257
TO BE CLIMBING
ROCK REEF POINT.

426
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,959
ROCK REEF POINT
WASN'T A PROBLEM.

427
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:29,962
IT WAS MERCURY CREEK.
OUR MAN-MADE BRIDGE
COLLAPSED.

428
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,763
WE HAD TOO
LITTLE SUPPORT

429
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:34,466
AND TOO MUCH
MOOSE THOMPSON.

430
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,001
WELL, I HOPED YOU
LEARNED SOMETHING.

431
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,236
I DID. I DID.

432
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,705
I LEARNED THAT DUCT TAPE
DOESN'T STICK TO BARK.

433
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,540
[possum squealing]

434
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:42,874
MEETING TIME.

435
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:44,810
YEAH, OKAY, HAR --

436
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:46,845
HOW CAN ME HAVE A MEETING
IF ALL THE GUYS ARE
IN THE HOSPITAL?

437
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,114
I INVITED
THE BOY SCOUTS.

438
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,083
OH, GREAT.
YEAH, OKAY.

439
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:54,152
I'LL BE DOWN
EVENTUALLY.

440
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:57,122
OKAY, IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

441
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,557
AND HAROLD'S RIGHT.

442
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,225
I DID ACTUALLY LEARN A
COUPLE OF THINGS TODAY.

443
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,494
NUMBER ONE, YOU CAN'T TEACH
AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS,

444
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:05,130
AND NUMBER TWO, YOU REALLY
CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE

445
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,965
BETWEEN HARDWOOD
AND SOFTWOOD TREES

446
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,868
WHEN YOU LAND ON THEM AT
ABOUT 100 MILES AN HOUR.

447
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,837
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

448
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:15,207
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND HAROLD
AND THE WHOLE GANG UP HERE
AT POSSUM LODGE,

449
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,542
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

450
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:21,980
[cheers and applause]

451
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,321
HERE HE COMES.

452
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,490
DON'T LAUGH.
HE WORKED HARD.

453
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,425
SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN.

454
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,232
[ STIFLING A LAUGH ]
ALL RISE.

455
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,970
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI. 

456
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,805
Red: SIT DOWN.

457
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:50,409
ALL RIGHT... MEN,

458
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:54,146
BOW YOUR HEADS FOR
THE... SCOUTS' PRAYER.

459
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,582
I'M A SCOUT,
BUT I CAN LIGHTEN UP,

460
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:01,186
IF I HAVE TO, I GUESS.

461
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:05,991
