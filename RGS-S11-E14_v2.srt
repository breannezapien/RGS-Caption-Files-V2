1
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:03,069
Red: YOU KNOW, WE GET REAL

2
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:04,571
COLD WINTERS UP AT THE LODGE,

3
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:06,106
AND THE CHALLENGE IS TRYING TO

4
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:07,574
KEEP THE PLACE WARM ENOUGH TO

5
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:08,641
SUPPORT HUMAN LIFE.

6
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:10,010
BUT I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

7
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,444
INSTEAD OF CRANKING UP THE

8
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:13,046
THERMOSTAT OR CLEAR-CUTTING A

9
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:14,547
FOREST JUST SO YOU CAN KEEP

10
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:16,116
COZY, THE TRUTH IS, YOU DON'T

11
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:17,851
HAVE TO HEAT THE WHOLE BUILDING.

12
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,285
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO HEAT THE

13
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:19,886
WHOLE ROOM.

14
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:21,287
ALL YOU HAVE TO HEAT IS YOUR OWN

15
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:21,755
BODY.

16
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,556
THAT'S WHAT THE ASTRONAUTS DO.

17
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:25,258
SO LET'S BE LIKE ASTRONAUTS.

18
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:26,793
GET YOURSELF ONE OF THESE BIG

19
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:27,594
GARMENT BAGS.

20
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:28,628
I DON'T NEED THIS.

21
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:30,063
I DON'T HAVE CLOTHES THAT I

22
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:30,797
DON'T WEAR.

23
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:32,365
AND THEN ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS

24
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,967
CUT YOURSELF A COUPLE ARMHOLES

25
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,202
AND LEGHOLES.

26
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,937
OKAY, WE'RE ALL SYSTEMS GO.

27
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:39,639
NOW I JUST PLUG IN MY HAIR

28
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,674
DRYER, WHICH IS SET ON HIGH, AND

29
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:42,876
I'LL BE LAUGHING.

30
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,078
DON'T YOU WISH YOU WERE?

31
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:47,047
[hair dryer whirring]

32
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,156
[cheers and applause]

33
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,267
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

34
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:08,868
NO, NO.

35
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:10,270
I APPRECIATE THAT.

36
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,671
WELL, IT'S A BIG WEEK AT THE

37
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:12,572

38
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,140

WHOEVER CATCHES IT GETS 1,000

43
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:19,879
BUCKS.

44
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,347
I MEAN, THIS WILL BE THE BIGGEST

45
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:22,649
INFLUX OF CASH AT THE LODGE

46
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,084
SINCE WE TOOK BACK OUR EMPTIES.

47
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,152
[laughter]

48
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,488
Harold: UNCLE RED...

50
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:30,824

WHAT THE HECK?

174
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:32,839
OH.

175
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,874
WONDERED WHERE THAT WRENCH GOT

176
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:35,341
TO.

177
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,743
THEN THEY TAKE THE GROUND-UP

178
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,311
COFFEE BEANS, PUT THEM INTO THIS

179
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,779
SPECIAL POT -- THAT'S WATER IN

180
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,246
THERE.

181
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:41,814
YOU BOIL THAT ALL UP.

182
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,049
THEN THEY TAKE ONE OF THESE

183
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:43,783
PLUNGER UNITS.

184
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,851
GOES DOWN INSIDE THERE.

185
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,819
AND YOU SQUEEZE ALL THE FLAVOR

186
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,087
OUT OF THE COFFEE.

187
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,355
ODD TO SEE A PLUNGER ON THE

188
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:50,590
INPUT SIDE OF THE EQUATION,

189
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,157
ISN'T IT?

190
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:52,258
[chuckles]

191
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:53,726
AND THEN THEY HAVE THEIR CUP OF

192
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:54,227
COFFEE.

193
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,662
BUT MAYBE YOU CAN'T AFFORD ALL

194
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:56,896
THESE SPECIAL APPLIANCES.

195
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,631
MAYBE YOU'VE ALREADY SPENT YOUR

196
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,233
DISPOSABLE INCOME ON COLLEGE

197
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,234
TUITION OR BAIL.

198
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,702
YOU NEED A CHEAPER WAY TO MAKE

199
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,504
COFFEE.

200
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,172
ALL YOU NEED IS A LAWN MOWER

201
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,807
WITH A GRASS CATCHER ON IT.

202
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,409
THEN WHAT YOU DO IS YOU TAKE

203
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,044
YOUR COFFEE BEANS, YOU MAKE A

204
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,645
PILE OF THEM ON SOME SMOOTH,

205
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,080
HARD SURFACE LIKED PAVED

206
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,715
DRIVEWAY OR A SIDEWALK OR THE

207
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,283
ROOF OF YOUR CAR.

208
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:18,951
THEN YOU SET THE BLADE AS LOW AS

209
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:19,619
SHE'LL GO.

210
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,087
GIVE THE BEANS A QUICK BUZZ.

211
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,322
I'M SURE THEY'LL RETURN THE

212
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,390
FAVOR LATER.

213
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,700
OKAY, NOW, WE TAKE OUR COFFEE

214
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,868
GROUNDS AND POUR THEM INTO OUR

215
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,603
COFFEEPOT.

216
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,939
AND THEN COMES THE BEST PART --

217
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,174
PLUNGING.

218
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,608
THAT'S BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE TO

219
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:43,376
DO IT BY HAND.

220
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:43,910
SEE?

221
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,611
THE PISTON AND CYLINDER OF AN

222
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:47,347
INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE USE

223
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,948
EXACTLY THE SAME MECHANICAL

224
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:50,683
PRINCIPLES AS A COFFEE PLUNGER.

225
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,352
WAIT A SECOND, WAIT A SECOND.

226
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,387
LET ME PUT MY COFFEE MUG UNDER

227
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,022
THE EXHAUST PIPE FIRST.

228
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,590
THE COFFEE WILL GO THROUGH THIS

229
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,591
THING PRETTY FAST.

230
00:05:58,591 --> 00:05:59,792
WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE, HAVEN'T

231
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:00,226
WE?

232
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:01,561
ALL RIGHT, NOW YOU JUST POUR THE

233
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,996
COFFEE INTO THE CARBURETOR.

234
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:06,132
POUR IT SLOW.

235
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,633
IF YOU STALL THIS THING, IT'S A

236
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,936
PIG TO GET HER GOING AGAIN.

237
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,804
ANOTHER BONUS WITH THIS IS YOU

238
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,539
CAN SAY TO YOUR GUESTS, "WHO

239
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,241
WANTS MORE [mower] COFFEE?"

240
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,043
GET IT?

241
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,644
MOWER.

242
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:25,718
YEAH.

243
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,487
AND HERE'S ANOTHER BONUS...

244
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,422
WITH THE CARBON MONOXIDE MIXED

245
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,457
IN THERE, THIS COFFEE WON'T KEEP

246
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,291
YOU AWAKE.

247
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,860
REMEMBER, IF WOMEN DON'T FIND

248
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,395
YOU HANDSOME, THEY SHOULD AT

249
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,397
LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

250
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:50,877
YOU KNOW, AS I GET OLDER, I FIND

251
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,311
THAT A LOT OF THINGS IN LIFE

252
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:53,546
KIND OF FOLLOW A SIMILAR

253
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,113
PATTERN.

254
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:55,915
FOR EXAMPLE, MY WIFE AND I JUST

255
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,750
COME UP TO OUR 35th ANNIVERSARY,

256
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,585
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MARRIAGE

257
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,922
IS LIKE A LONG GAME OF POKER.

258
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,791
SOME DAYS YOU HAVE THE CARDS,

259
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,826
AND SOME DAYS YOU DON'T.

260
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,528
SO YOU GOT TO LEARN HOW TO BE A

261
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,196
GOOD LOSER, OCCASIONALLY HOW TO

262
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,364
BE A GRACIOUS WINNER.

263
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,999
MAINLY YOU GOT TO KNOW HOW TO

264
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,134
BLUFF.

265
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,569
YOU GOT TO KNOW WHEN TO PRESS

266
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,037
YOUR LUCK AND WHEN TO HEAD FOR

267
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:18,671
THE HILLS.

268
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,573
IT'S LIKE THAT KENNY ROGERS

269
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:21,307
SONG...

270
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,542
ALTHOUGH AFTER FIVE OR SIX

271
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,043
MARRIAGES, HE'S OBVIOUSLY BETTER

272
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,378
AT FOLDING THEM THAN HE IS AT

273
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,112
HOLDING THEM.

274
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,413
[laughter]

275
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,081
BUT THE MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO

276
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:30,883
KEEP PUTTING YOUR ANTE IN THERE

277
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:32,251
EVERY HAND, EVERY DAY.

278
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,420
IT'S JUST A GAME AFTER ALL, AND

279
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,888
IT WILL GET BETTER.

280
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,657
A FULL HOUSE USUALLY STARTS OUT

281
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:38,958
AS JUST A PAIR, RIGHT?

282
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,960
SO YOU JUST HANG IN THERE.

283
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,662
PLAY THE HAND YOU'RE DEALT.

284
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,363
YOU KNOW THAT SHE'S ULTIMATELY

285
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,998
GONNA WIN THE POT, BUT IF YOU

286
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,700
PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGHT, SHE MAY

287
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,168
BUY YOU SOMETHING FRILLY.

288
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:50,069
[laughter]

289
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,737
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

290
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,206
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

291
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,208
[cheers and applause]

292
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,445
WELL, WE'VE BEEN OUT THERE

293
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:00,847
FISHING FOR FOUR HOURS, AND

294
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,448
NOBODY'S CAUGHT THE PRIZE FISH.

295
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,016
IN FACT, NOBODY'S CAUGHT ANY

296
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:04,484
FISH.

297
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,818
I THINK THE ONLY THING LIVING IN

298
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,053
POSSUM LAKE IS OUR BAIT, AND I

299
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,287
DON'T LIKE ITS CHANCES, TO BE

300
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,189
HONEST WITH YOU.

301
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,224
Harold: UNCLE RED, DID YOU

302
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:11,924
WANT TO TALK TO ME?

303
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:12,725
Red: YEAH, HAROLD.

304
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:13,826
I WAS LOOKING AT THE RULES HERE,

305
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:14,894
AND I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS

306
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:15,294
FOR YOU.

307
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:16,562
Harold: DID YOU PAY THE $10

308
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:17,196
ENTRANCE FEE?

309
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,364
Red: OH, HAROLD, I JUST SAID

310
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:19,065
I HAD QUESTIONS.

311
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,199
YOU DON'T RESPOND WITH ANOTHER

312
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:20,666
QUESTION.

313
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,767
THAT'S VERY, VERY, VERY

314
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:22,535
DISRESPECTFUL.

315
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:23,469
Harold: I'M SORRY.

316
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:26,672
SORRY.

317
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,774
SO, DID YOU PAY THE $10 ENTRANCE

318
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:29,609
FEE?

319
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,244
Red: I'M GOOD FOR IT, HAROLD,

320
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:31,677
OKAY?

321
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,179
WHEN I CATCH THE $1,000 FISH,

322
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,249
JUST GIVE ME $990 OF IT.

323
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,917
OKAY, NOW, IN THE RULES HERE, IT

324
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,519
DOESN'T LIMIT THE FISHERMEN TO

325
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,153
USE ANY KIND OF SPECIAL BAIT OR

326
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,455
FISHING ROD OR ANYTHING.

327
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,389
Harold: NO, NO, NO.

328
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:44,423
WE'VE LEFT THAT UP TO THE

329
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:45,391
INDIVIDUAL FISHERMAN...

330
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:46,893
AS LONG AS HE'S PAID THE $10

331
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:47,693
ENTRANCE FEE.

332
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,862
Red: SO I CAN CATCH THIS FISH

333
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,030
ANY WAY I WANT.

334
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,498
Harold: NO, NO, NOT YOU...

335
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,066
UNLESS YOU PAY THE $10 ENTRANCE

336
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:54,467
FEE.

337
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,668
Red: ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,

338
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:56,202
ALL RIGHT.

339
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,737
BUT IF YOU TAKE MY 10 BUCKS,

340
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,272
THEN ANY WAY I WANT TO CATCH

341
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,573
THIS FISH IS FAIR GAME.

342
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:01,440
IS THAT RIGHT?

343
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,308
IS THAT IT?

344
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,409
Harold: YEAH, OKAY, FINE.

345
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,510
Red: GREAT. GREAT, GREAT.

346
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,645
NOW, HAROLD, REMEMBER YOU HAD

347
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:06,779
THAT BADMINTON TOURNAMENT AND

348
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:07,880
YOU HAD ALL THOSE GEEKY KIDS

349
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,881
FROM THE COMPUTER SCHOOL?

350
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,283
Harold: WAS THAT NOT GREAT?

351
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,417
WAS THAT NOT GREAT, HUH?

352
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:12,785
25 GAMES OF BADMINTON GOING ON

353
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:13,819
ALL AT THE SAME TIME.

354
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:15,054
YOU WANT TO TALK EXCITING?

355
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,222
Red: OH, YEAH. OH, YEAH.

356
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,456
Harold: THAT WAS BADMINTON

357
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:17,823
THERE.

358
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,624
Red: OH, YEAH.

359
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:19,759
YEAH, EVERYBODY HAD A BIRD.

360
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,526
THAT'S FOR SURE.

361
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,328
BUT...

362
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,496
I'M JUST WONDERING, WHAT DID

363
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:24,497
YOU DO WITH THE BADMINTON

364
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,698
EQUIPMENT WHEN YOU WERE DONE?

365
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:26,866
Harold: I JUST PUT IT IN THE

366
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:27,767
ATTIC OF THE BOATHOUSE.

367
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:28,668
Red: THANKS, HAROLD.

368
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:29,902
Harold: YOU BE CAREFUL WITH

369
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:30,570
THOSE RACKETS.

370
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,470
THEY WERE EXPENSIVE.

371
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,538
Red: I'M NOT GONNA USE THE

372
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:33,205
RACKETS, HAROLD.

373
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,607
Harold: OH, OKAY.

374
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:35,508
THE NET.

375
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:36,375
THE NET!

376
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,209
THE NET!

377
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,311
NO, NOT THE NET.

378
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,745
Red: DON'T YOU HATE IT WHEN

379
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,247
YOU'RE DRIVING IN HEAVY TRAFFIC

380
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,748
IN THE WINTER AND YOU RUN OUT OF

381
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:43,950
WINDSHIELD-WASHER FLUID?

382
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,551
'CAUSE THE WIPERS WON'T DO A

383
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,320
THING WITH NO MOISTURE ON THERE.

384
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,121
SO YOU END UP TAILGATING TRACTOR

385
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,790
TRAILERS TRYING TO CATCH THEIR

386
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,624
VAPOR TRAIL.

387
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:52,992
I'VE BEEN KNOWN TO LEAN OUT THE

388
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,226
WINDOW AT 75 KLICKS JUST TO

389
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:55,261
THROW MY COFFEE ON THE

390
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,529
WINDSHIELD.

391
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,197
WELL, THAT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN

392
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,098
TO ME AGAIN...

393
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,633
'CAUSE, FRIENDS, YOU HAVE JUST

394
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,268
WITNESSED THE LAST WASHER REFILL

395
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,736
I'M EVER GONNA HAVE TO MAKE.

396
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,504
FROM NOW ON, I'M GONNA RECYCLE

397
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,106
MY WINDSHIELD-WASHER FLUID.

398
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,741
THAT'S WHAT THIS FUNNEL'S FOR.

399
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,376
"HOW'S THAT GONNA WORK?" YOU'RE

400
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:11,377
PROBABLY ASKING...

401
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:12,845
AMONG OTHER THINGS.

402
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,246
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU HOW IT'S

403
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:14,947
GONNA WORK.

404
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,350
CAN YOU SAY "EAVES TROUGH"?

405
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,361
[panting]

406
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,095
HI, GORD.

407
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,063
ON YOUR WAY TO A SANITY HEARING?

408
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:32,465
Gord: NO.

409
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,566
NO, NO. NOT YET.

410
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:34,533
BUT THIS IS PERFECT.

411
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:35,835
I FOUND AN OLD BOOK OF MAGIC

412
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,236
TRICKS, AND I NEED A VOLUNTEER.

413
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:37,770
SIT DOWN.

414
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,871
Red: YOU'RE NOT GONNA TIE ME

415
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,673
UP, ARE YOU?

416
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,008
Gord: COME ON, RED, COME ON.

417
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,376
YOU KNOW I'M NOT ALLOWED ROPE UP

418
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:44,043
HERE ANYMORE.

419
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:47,146
NOW...

420
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:47,980
PICK A CARD.

421
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,714
ALL RIGHT.

422
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,216
DON'T SHOW ME WHAT IT IS.

423
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:50,816
Red: ALL RIGHT.

424
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:51,951
Gord: MEMORIZE IT. ALL RIGHT?

425
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:52,485
Red: YEAH.

426
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,886
Gord: OKAY, NOW PUT IT BACK

427
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:54,553
IN THE DECK.

428
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:55,721
Red: OKAY.

429
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:56,389
DONE.

430
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,623
Gord: DONE? ALL RIGHT.

431
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,091
NOW I MIX THE DECK UP A LITTLE

432
00:10:59,091 --> 00:10:59,458
BIT.

433
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,327
PREPARE TO BE AMAZED AS I TURN

434
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,062
OVER THE NEXT CARD TO REVEAL

435
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,398
YOUR...JACK OF SPADES.

436
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:08,300
Red: NO.

437
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,102
Gord: WELL, THEN IT'S A QUEEN

438
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:10,936
OF DIAMONDS.

439
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:13,339
Red: NO.

440
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,009
Gord: COMMUNITY CHEST?

441
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,444
Red: YOU HAVE NO IDEA, DO

442
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:19,111
YOU, GORD?

443
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,479
Red: COME ON, RED, LIGHTEN

444

LOOK, IT'S AN OLD MAGICIANS'

446
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:23,849
GAG -- MAKE THE AUDIENCE BELIEVE

447
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,117
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

448
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:25,551
DOING.

449
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:28,287
Red: BOY, DOES IT EVER WORK.

450
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:29,555
Gord: OH, WELL.

451
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,524
HAVE YOU SEEN WHAT'S UNDERNEATH

452
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,191
MY HAT?

453
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,426
[laughs]

454
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,694
Red: OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

455
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,594
THAT'S A RABBIT.

456
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:37,296
Gord: OH, IS IT, RED?

457
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,230
IS IT A RABBIT?

458
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,098
Red: YEAH, YEAH.

459
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,533
Gord: [laughs]

460
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,567
Red: ALL RIGHT.

461
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:42,735
OKAY, THAT'S FLOWERS.

462
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,003
Gord: OH, FLOWERS?

463
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:44,570
Red: YEAH.

464
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,538
OH!

465
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,273
OKAY, OKAY!

466
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,808
THAT'S ANNOYING.

467
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,409
Gord: OH, WELL, THEN ALLOW ME

468
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:51,811
TO LEND YOU MY HANDKERCHIEF.

469
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:52,812
[laughs]

470
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,146
Red: OKAY, GORD, YOU KNOW

471
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:54,547
WHAT?

472
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,981
THIS IS NOT HOW IT WORKS, OKAY?

473
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,450
YOU DON'T JUST KEEP CHANGING THE

474
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,050
TRICK, EH?

475
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,552
YOU FINISH THE TRICK THAT YOU

476
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,386
STARTED WITH.

477
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,021
THAT'S HOW THE WHOLE DEAL WORKS.

478
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,389
Gord: [sobs]

479
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,257
YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.

480
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:06,392
WHO AM I KIDDING?

481
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,660
I'M NOT A MAGICIAN.

482
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,862
I'M A LOSER.

483
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,464
MY LIFE IS ONE BIG PILE OF

484
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,798
UNFULFILLED DREAMS...

485
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:15,201
MISSED OPPORTUNITIES...

486
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,535
AND THE OCCASIONAL RESTRAINING

487
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,804
ORDER, RIGHT?

488
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,573
I DON'T BLAME YOU FOR NOT LIKING

489
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:20,973
ME.

490
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:21,841
Red: NO, NO.

491
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,442
IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T LIKE YOU.

492
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,010
IT'S JUST THAT I JUST WANTED TO

493
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,112
SEE MY TWO OF CLUBS.

494
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,279
Gord: OH! OH!

495
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,450
YOU MEAN...THIS TWO OF CLUBS?

496
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,586
[laughs]

497
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,453
Red: YEAH.

498
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,088
YEAH, THAT'S IT. YEAH.

499
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,656
WAY TO GO. WAY TO GO.

500
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:38,924
Gord: THERE'S MORE WHERE THAT

501
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:39,425
CAME FROM.

502
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,427
[laughs]

503
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,162
Red: MIKE AND I MET OUT ON

504
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,997
THE RINK THERE BEHIND THE LODGE

505
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,465
TO HAVE A LITTLE GAME OF

506
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:47,133
CURLING.

507
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,834
AND WE BROUGHT OUR ROCKS AS WE

508
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,503
ALWAYS DO, AND THE BROOMS WERE

509
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,204
LIKE NEW BECAUSE THEY WERE FOR

510
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,372
CLEANING THE LODGE.

511
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:54,507
AND, UH, MIKE HAD BROUGHT A

512
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:55,241
GALLON OF PAINT.

513
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,575
HE WANTED ME TO GO UP AND, UH --

514
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:57,843
IN CURLING, THEY HAVE SOMETHING

515
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:58,878
THAT'S CALLED A HOUSE.

516
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,179
IT'S LIKE A DOT IN THE MIDDLE,

517
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,447
AND IT'S GOT RINGS AROUND THE

518
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,148
OUTSIDE, SO...

519
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,916
SOMETIMES IT'S TOUGH TO FIGURE

520
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,518
OUT HOW TO PAINT A CIRCLE,

521
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,086
ESPECIALLY ON THE ICE, BUT

522
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,954
LUCKILY I HAD COME WITH AN EAVES

523
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,556
TROUGH NAIL ACTUALLY IN MY

524
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:11,157
POCKET.

525
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,858
SO I PIKE THAT DOWN THROUGH THE

526
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,627
CAN OF PAINT, THEN FLIP HER

527
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,127
OVER...

528
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,228
FLIP HER RIGHT OVER QUICK.

529
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,329
AND THERE'S YOUR CIRCLE.

530
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:18,464
OKAY, THAT'S THE DOT IN THE

531
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:18,964
MIDDLE.

532
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,199
NOW YOU GOT TO JUST BRING HER

533
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,433
OUT, AND YOU START DOING THE

534
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:22,134
RINGS WITH IT.

535
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,004
AND ROUND AND ROUND SHE GOES.

536
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,472
IT'S A PRETTY EFFECTIVE WAY

537
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,973
TO -- BEFORE YOU KNOW IT --

538
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,708
YOU THINK THEY PUT HOUSES UP

539
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,043
FAST WHERE YOU LIVE?

540
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,112
I BUILT THAT ONE IN ABOUT TWO

541
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:33,913
SECONDS.

542
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,347
SO NOW WE'RE READY TO GO.

543
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,949
SO MIKE -- HE PLAYS LEAD, BUT WE

544
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,450
HAVE A KIND OF SMALL TEAM, SO

545
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,052
YOU GOT TO DO YOUR OWN SWEEPING.

546
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,454
AND, UH, HE'S OUT THERE, AND

547
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:43,789
AWAY HE GOES.

548
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:44,957
I WASN'T PAYING AS MUCH

549
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,225
ATTENTION AS I SHOULD HAVE

550
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:47,359
BECAUSE MIKE DOESN'T DO

551
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,727
EVERYTHING JUST RIGHT BY THE

552
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,262
BOOK, YOU KNOW.

553
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:52,198
OKAY, SO -- SO NOW I GOT TO

554
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,233
THROW IN MY TAKEOUT ROCK, AND

555
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,468
I'M PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH TAKEOUT

556
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:59,638
AS A GENERAL RULE, BUT...UH, I

557
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:00,840
DIDN'T GET -- I MISSED.

558
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,941
ALL RIGHT, I MISSED.

559
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,108
OKAY, SO...

560
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:05,044
SO NOW MIKE FIRES ANOTHER ONE IN

561
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,712
THERE, AND THEN HE GETS THE

562
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,013
SWEEPER GOING AGAIN.

563
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,682
HERE AGAIN, YOU KNOW, I THINK I

564
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,417
NEEDED SOMEONE ELSE OR SOME TYPE

565
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,052
OF A REFEREE BECAUSE, UH, MIKE

566
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,787
IS NOW JUST GETTING BLATANT WITH

567
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,522
THE WAY HE'S CHEATING, AS FAR AS

568
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,290
I'M CONCERNED.

569
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,658
SO I FIGURE I GOT TO GO TO THE

570
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:20,292
NEXT LEVEL.

571
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:21,126
FORGET THE ROCK.

572
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:23,629
I'M GONNA PUSH MY CAR.

573
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,531
AND, UH...

574
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,333
THAT SHOULD TAKE OUT A -- THIS

575
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,268
IS ACTUALLY MY TAKEOUT CAR, AND,

576
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,803
UH, COMING IN THERE, LOOKING

577
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:31,270
GOOD.

578
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,905
THAT ONE'S OUT, AND THAT ONE'S

579
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:33,372
GONE.

580
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,373
OH, BABY!

581
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,141
DEAD CENTER.

582
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:37,776
SO THEN MIKE -- HE FIRES HIS,

583
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,445
AND HE GIVES IT A LITTLE SPIN.

584
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,980
AND HE'S GONNA TRY TO CURL HER

585
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,580
IN THERE.

586
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,015
IT'S A KIND OF A -- OH, LOOK

587
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:43,682
OUT, MIKE!

588
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:46,218
OHH, BABY!

589
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,922
AND...OH, MY GOODNESS.

590
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,358
YOU GET THE BIG WIN THERE, MIKE.

591
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,159
LOOKS LIKE YOUR END CAME THROUGH

592
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:54,727
AGAIN.

593
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,528
HOW IS YOUR END FEELING, ANYWAY?

594
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,131
NOT THAT GOOD, HUH?

595
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,275
THIS IS THE REPAIR-SHOP PART OF

596
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,509
THE SHOW WE CALL "IF IT AIN'T

597
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,811
BROKE, YOU'RE NOT TRYING."

598
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:14,647
SO, MIKE, WHAT DO YOU GOT FOR US

599
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:15,180
TODAY?

600
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,649
Mike: IT'S A CAR RADIO.

601
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:17,650
IT DOESN'T WORK.

602
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,051
Red: I FIGURED THAT, MIKE,

603
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,586
BUT THIS IS A GREAT BECAUSE WITH

604
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,987
ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT, THERE'S

605
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,155
ACTUALLY A STEP-BY-STEP

606
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,590
PROCEDURE THAT A REAL HANDYMAN

607
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,724
GOES THROUGH, OKAY?

608
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:28,994
STEP ONE -- TURN IT ON.

609
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,229
Mike: SHOULDN'T IT HAVE A

610
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,363
POWER SOURCE OR SOMETHING?

611
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:32,164
Red: OH! YEAH.

612
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,065
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

613
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:37,536
STEP MINUS ONE -- PLUG HER IN.

614
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,104
Mike: WELL, IT'S A CAR RADIO.

615
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,372
SHE DOESN'T HAVE A PLUG.

616
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:41,807
IT KIND OF CONNECTS UP TO THE

617
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:42,374
BATTERY.

618
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:43,709
Red: YEAH, I GOT ONE.

619
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:44,643
I GOT ONE HERE.

620
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,145
YOU KNOW WHAT THREW ME OFF,

621
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:46,612
MIKE?

622
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,047
THAT'S A VERY FANCY RADIO.

623
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,548
I NEVER SEEN ONE LIKE THAT

624
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:50,115
BEFORE.

625
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,483
IS THAT A FOREIGN UNIT?

626
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:52,651
Mike: IT'S MADE IN TEXAS.

627
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:56,588
Red: WELL, THERE YOU GO.

628
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:57,256
OH, LOOK.

629
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:58,357
THE LIGHT CAME ON.

630
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,858
Mike: WELL, THAT'S ABOUT AS

631
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:00,826
FAR AS I GOT, TOO.

632
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,027
Red: DID YOU TRY TURNING IT

633
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,295
OFF, THEN TURNING IT RIGHT BACK

634
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:03,762
ON AGAIN?

635
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,064
Mike: YEAH, I DID THAT.

636
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,032
Red: DID YOU JIGGLE IT?

637
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,300
Mike: UH-HUH.

638
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,535
Red: DID YOU TRY HITTING IT?

639
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,637
Mike: YEP.

640
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,938
Red: DID YOU TRY TURNING IT

641
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,340
OFF AND THEN, LIKE, LET HER JUST

642
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,541
SIT FOR 10 MINUTES, BUT THEN

643
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,909
EVERY 20 SECONDS, YOU WENT BACK

644
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,177
AND DID THE SAME DARN ROUTINE

645
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,411
ALL THE WAY THROUGH ALL OVER

646
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:19,812
AGAIN?

647
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,147
Mike: ABOUT A DOZEN TIMES,

648
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:22,815
YEAH.

649
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,550
Red: THEN I THINK WE'RE

650
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,951
SCUPPERED HERE, MIKE.

651
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,820
THE ONLY OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS TO

652
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,655
LOOK AT THE MANUAL, AND I'M NOT

653
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:33,359
GONNA BE GOING THERE.

654
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,393
WE'RE DONE.

655
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,261
Mike: SHOULDN'T IT HAVE LIKE

656
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,796
A SPEAKER ATTACHED TO IT?

657
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:40,866
Red: IT, UH -- I WAS JUST

658
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,735
COMING TO THAT.

659
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,603
WE'RE GONNA HOOK THE SPEAKER

660
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:45,971
UP TO IT NOW, MIKE.

661
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,007
THAT'S THE NEXT -- JUST TO HELP

662
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:48,474
US.

663
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,509
HOW MANY OF YOU WERE AHEAD OF US

664
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,243
ON THAT?

665
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,644
[laughter]

666
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:53,946
BULL.

667
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,682
[laughter]

668
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,350
[radio static]

669
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,451
Mike: WE'RE GETTING

670
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:00,085
SOMETHING.

671
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,720
Red: YEAH. COME IN, RANGOON.

672
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,524
[laughs]

673
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,293
ROGER, SERGEANT, WE COPY.

674
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:09,728
Red: SOUNDS LIKE THE COPS.

675
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,397
YEAH, BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR A

676
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:12,765
SUSPECT CARRYING A POLICE

677
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,633
SCANNER.

678
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:15,901
Mike: THANKS, MR. GREEN.

679
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,903
I GOT TO GO.

680
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:24,510
Red: ONE OF THE HAZARDS OF

681
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,145
WINTER IS GETTING TOO MUCH SNOW

682
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,346
BUILT UP ON YOUR ROOF.

683
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,048
YOU CAN HAVE AN AVALANCHE JUST

684
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,816
COMING OUT YOUR OWN FRONT DOOR.

685
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,117
AND, BELIEVE ME, IT'S A REAL

686
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:33,519
SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM TO SUDDENLY

687
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,887
HAVE 30 POUNDS OF SNOW SHOW UP

688
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,488
IN YOUR UNDERSHORTS.

689
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,223
NOW, FOR BIG MOUNTAINS LIKE THEY

690
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,892
HAVE IN SWITZERLAND OR ON "THE

691
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,326
WALTONS," THEY CONTROL THE

692
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,095
AMOUNT OF SNOW BUILDUP BY FIRING

693
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:43,929
OFF A CANNON.

694
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,497
THE EXPLOSION BREAKS UP ALL THE

695
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:47,066
SNOWDRIFTS SO THEY KIND OF ROLL

696
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,567
DOWN THE HILL WITHOUT TURNING

697
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,035
ANY CROSS-COUNTRY SKIERS INTO

698
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,404
FROSTED FLAKES.

699
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,106
THEY BASICALLY HAVE A BUNCH OF

700
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,908
SMALL AVALANCHES TO AVOID HAVING

701
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:56,742
A BIG ONE...

702
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,077
LIKE THE WAY YOU HAVE THOSE

703
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,511
SMALL DAILY DISAGREEMENTS WITH

704
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:00,913
YOUR WIFE TO AVOID HAVING THE

705
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,414
BIG ONE WHERE YOU END UP LIVING

706
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,749
IN YOUR CAR.

707
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,250
UNFORTUNATELY, I CAN'T FIRE A

708
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,752
CANNON TO GET THE SNOW OFF MY

709
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,253
ROOF BECAUSE THE LODGE CANNON

710
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,888
APPARENTLY WILL NOT BE RETURNING

711
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:11,590
TO US UNTIL AFTER THE TRIAL.

712
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,759
SO INSTEAD, I'M GONNA MAKE A

713
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,095
CANNON-LIKE NOISE BY FILLING MY

714
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,865
ENGINE HERE WITH HAIR SPRAY.

715
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,467
GUYS MY AGE DON'T NEED HAIR

716
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,135
SPRAY ANYWAY, UNLESS IT HAS

717
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,403
PAINT IN IT.

718
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,238
ALL WE DO NOW IS START THE

719
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,307
ENGINE AND LET NATURE TAKE ITS

720
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,074
COURSE.

721
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:31,143
[engine turns over]

722
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:51,663
[panting]

723
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:54,500
[laughs]

724
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,101
THOSE BADMINTON NETS WORKED

725
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,803
GREAT.

726
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:01,640
I BELIEVE I CAUGHT MY LIMIT.

727
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,475
Harold: IT'S DISGUSTING.

728
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,110
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A FISHING

729
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,879
DERBY, NOT A SALVAGE EXPEDITION.

730
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,247
Red: HAROLD, WHEN YOU'RE IN A

731
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,681
CONTEST, YOU GOT TO USE YOUR

732
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:10,315
INGENUITY.

733
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,350
I'M A CREATIVE GUY.

734
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,118
Harold: YOU'RE A DESTRUCTIVE

735
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:13,552
GUY.

736
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:14,486
DID YOU EVER HEAR OF

737
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,187
SPORTSMANSHIP?

738
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,321
YOU THINK THIS IS WHAT THE

739
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,556
GREEKS HAD IN MIND WHEN THEY

740
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:18,590
DEVELOPED THE OLYMPICS?

741
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,626
Red: NOW, HAROLD, THE GREEKS

742
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:22,060
USED TO COMPETE NUDE.

743
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,762
I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD WORK SO

744
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,164
GOOD FOR A FISHING DERBY.

745
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,798
BAD PLACE TO SNAG A LURE.

746
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,600
Harold: OH, YEAH.

747
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,701
AW, DON'T DO THAT.

748
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,470
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

749
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,105
YOU TRIED TO WIN BY CHEATING.

750
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,306
YEAH, WELL, THANKFULLY ALL YOU

751
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,474
ENDED UP DOING WAS CLEANING UP

752
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:36,008
THE LAKE.

753
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,809
[laughs]

754
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,011
AND SINCE THERE WAS NO ACTUAL

755
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,179
WINNER, WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE

756
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,346
PRIZE MONEY, AND WE'RE GONNA

757
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,514
RESTOCK IT WITH HEALTHY FISH.

758
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,782
Red: WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "NO

759
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:44,616
PRIZEWINNER," HUH?

760
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:45,684
[laughs]

761
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,618
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,687
EH?

763
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,888
Harold: THAT'S MY CARAMEL

764
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:50,289
CANDY.

765
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,223
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

766
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,024
Red: NO, WAIT.

767
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,025
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

768
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,159
THIS IS WHAT I MEANT.

769
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,394
DOES THAT LOOK FAMILIAR,

770
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,128
HAROLD, HUH?

771
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,196
Harold: YEAH, OKAY, OKAY.

772
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,697
THAT'S THE TAG, BUT THERE'S NO

773
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,831
ACTUAL FISH ON THERE.

774
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,099
Red: I KNEW YOU WERE GONNA

775
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:01,633
SAY THAT.

776
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:02,834
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT PICTURE.

777
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,036
WHAT DO YOU SEE THERE, HUH?

778
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,437
Harold: [laughs]

779
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:06,605
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

780
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:07,573
Red: UP ON THE BRIDGE.

781
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:08,640
THE FISH JUMPED OUT OF

782
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,908
POSSUM LAKE, RAN ACROSS THE

783
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,210
BRIDGE...

784
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,011
AND DOVE INTO MERCURY.

785
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:13,912
SEE THAT CARIBOU?

786
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,113
HE HAD HIM THERE STOPPING

787
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,949
TRAFFIC.

788
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,217
SO LET'S COUGH UP THE 1,000

PRIZE MONEY.

792
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,254
YOU DIDN'T BRING IN THE ACTUAL
