1
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:08,041
(Car alarm going off)

2
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,844
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

3
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,381
IF YOU LOVE THE GREAT OUTDOORS
AND THE BEAUTIFUL WILDERNESS,

4
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:15,949
WATCH IT ON T.V.,

5
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:19,185
WITH YOUR HOST, MY UNCLE,
RED GREEN!

6
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:20,820
(Applause and cheering)

7
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:23,089
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

8
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:24,491
(Whistling)

9
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:26,426
(Cheering)

10
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,294
(Applause)

11
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,864
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
APPRECIATE IT.

12
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,099
BIT OF EXCITEMENT AT THE LODGE.

13
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,701
BUSTER HADFIELD'S CAR

14
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:36,202
HAS BEEN STOLEN.

15
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:39,105
UNCLE RED, THE CORRECT TERM
IS "REPOSSESSED".

16
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,441
NO, THIS IS AN ACTUAL THEFT.

17
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:44,043
BUSTER REPORTED IT TO THE COPS.

18
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,179
I BET IT'S NOT
CRIMINAL PURPOSES.

19
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:49,082
MAYBE IT'S KIDS ON A JOYRIDE.

20
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:52,285
'79 PACER? I DON'T THINK SO.

21
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:57,357
(Horns honking)

22
00:00:57,423 --> 00:00:59,893
(Geese honking)

23
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,329
(Quacking)

24
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:08,234
(Red): TODAY, I'LL SHOW YOU

25
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,637
HOW TO BURGLAR-PROOF YOUR CAR.

26
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:13,039
HAROLD'S GONNA DO
SOME WOOD CARVING.

27
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:14,641
WAY TO GO, YOUNG FELLA.

28
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:17,443
DALTON TRIES
TO GET ME TO SAY "ART",

29
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,978
WHICH IS A STRETCH.

30
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:22,148
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW
TO WORK ON YOUR LAWN-MOWER.

31
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,856
THE POLICE ISSUED A BULLETIN
FOR BUSTER'S STOLEN CAR.

32
00:01:29,922 --> 00:01:33,726
LUCKILY, ANYONE DRIVING A PACER
WILL ATTRACT SOME SUSPICION.

33
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:36,362
NO CAR IS SAFE THESE DAYS.

34
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,798
THEY DEVELOPED
THIS ANTI-THEFT DEVICE

35
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,633
YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN.

36
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,268
IT'S CALLED A DOOR LOCK.

37
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:43,970
(Audience laughing)

38
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,672
IT'S ON THE DOOR!

39
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:47,006
(Laughing)

40
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:49,042
LOCKS ARE A WASTE OF TIME.

41
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,444
YOU LOCK YOUR CAR.

42
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,213
YOU GOTTA FIND A HANGER
TO GET THE KEYS OUT.

43
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,616
NEXT TIME YOU LOCK HER,
YOU NEED ANOTHER HANGER

44
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,818
'CAUSE YOU LOCKED THE FIRST ONE
IN BESIDE THE KEYS.

45
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:02,755
YOU GOTTA BUY BURGLAR TOOLS
TO BREAK IN TO YOUR CAR.

46
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:05,091
SOMEWHERE DOWN THE ROAD, YOU
LOCK THE TOOLS IN THE TRUNK.

47
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,826
YOU SEE WHY IT DOESN'T WORK?

48
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,162
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT --
MY FAULT.

49
00:02:09,228 --> 00:02:12,365
I ASSUMED SOME INTELLECT
AND ATTENTION TO DETAIL.

50
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:15,368
I WAS WAY OFF BASE,
LOST MY HEAD.

51
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:16,869
(Audience laughing)

52
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:20,840
(Red): BILL'S GONNA SHOW US
SOME TRICKS WITH HIS BIKE.

53
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,442
DIDN'T LIKE THAT ONE.

54
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:24,076
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT, BILL?

55
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:25,578
YOU'RE JUST IRRITATING ME.

56
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,313
OH! OH!

57
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,248
OHHHH!

58
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,983
OH, I LIKE THAT ONE.

59
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,552
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

60
00:02:32,618 --> 00:02:34,120
COME ON OUT, BILL.

61
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,689
DO THAT ONE AGAIN, WOULD YOU?

62
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,458
(Laughing)

63
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:41,360
THIS IS FOR THE BIG ONE!

64
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:44,864
TODAY'S PRIZE IS A BUY-ONE,
GET-ONE-FREE GIFT CERTIFICATE

65
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,400
FROM HERBIE DOUGAN'S
HOUSE OF DOORKNOBS.

66
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:50,870
MR. DALTON, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO GET MY UNCLE TO SAY

67
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,139
THIS WORD.

68
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,307
(Laughing)

69
00:02:54,373 --> 00:02:56,142
THIRTY SECONDS, AND GO.

70
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,643
AN OIL
PAINTING.

71
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,613
TWO COATS WITH
A PRIMER.

72
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,082
SOMETHING YOU BUY
AT AN AUCTION.

73
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:04,650
BROKEN STOVE.

74
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,319
THINK
FANCY AUCTION.

75
00:03:06,385 --> 00:03:08,888
A WORKING STOVE.

76
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:13,159
YOU'RE LOOKING AT PICTURES
OF A HORSE AND ANGEL AND NUDES.

77
00:03:13,225 --> 00:03:15,995
CUSTOMIZED VAN.

78
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,496
SOMETHING... SOMETHING
COLLECTABLE,

79
00:03:17,563 --> 00:03:19,532
SOMETHING MORE VALUABLE,
SOMETHING...

80
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,734
OH, OH, OH, HUBCAPS.

81
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,337
YOU'D HANG THIS ON A WALL.

82
00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:26,973
STUFFED BASS?

83
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,708
THEY'RE NICE,
THEY'RE LOVELY.

84
00:03:28,774 --> 00:03:30,242
YOU GO TO
A GALLERY.

85
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:32,912
THEY HANG THESE ON WALLS
AND PEOPLE LOOK AT IT.

86
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,914
THEY HANG UP!
MOON?

87
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:38,217
THEY HANG THEM IN GALLERIES,
WITH SCULPTURES, PAINTINGS!

88
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,719
THESE ARE...

89
00:03:39,785 --> 00:03:41,220
OH, THEY'RE
WEIRD,

90
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:42,655
AND THE
ABSTRACT STUFF--

91
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,190
YOU'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME.

92
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,459
THE KINKERMAN GUY,
HIS FIRST NAME.

93
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:48,794
BILLY?

94
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,796
NO, HIS BROTHER, THE DRUNK!

95
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,832
OH, THEY'RE BOTH JUICERS.

96
00:03:52,898 --> 00:03:54,967
THE MECHANIC,
THE ONE THAT STOLE!

97
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:56,969
OH, ART.

98
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,972
(Ringing bell)

99
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,039
(Strums acoustic guitar)

100
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,776
WHEN LIFE HAS GIVEN YOU
A TASTE OF REJECTION

101
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,512
GETTING A DOG
IS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION

102
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,081
HE'LL BE YOUR BUDDY,
YOUR SERVANT, YOUR FRIEND

103
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:11,884
HE'LL BE THERE
WHEN YOU'RE AT THE END

104
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,320
MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER
WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF DOUGH

105
00:04:14,386 --> 00:04:17,056
WHEN YOU'VE DONE ALL YOU CAN
WITH THE LITTLE YOU KNOW

106
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:20,159
'CAUSE NO MATTER HOW FAR
DOWN LIFE'S LADDER YOU GO

107
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:23,662
YOUR DOG WILL ALWAYS BE
ONE RUNG BELOW

108
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:27,166
(Howling)

109
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,868
(Laughing)

110
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:31,604
WITH CARS GETTING STOLEN
AT THE LODGE,

111
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,372
THOUGHT I'D SHOW YOU HOW

112
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,674
TO MAKE YOUR CAR BURGLAR-PROOF.

113
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:37,476
YOU'RE THINKING THE BEST WAY

114
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,745
IS TO HAVE A CAR
NOT WORTH STEALING.

115
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,380
THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK.

116
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,382
TO A BURGLAR,
FOURTH-CLASS RIDING

117
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,651
IS BETTER THAN
FIRST-CLASS WALKING.

118
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,152
SO YOU'RE BETTER OFF

119
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:49,555
WITH A MULTI-STAGE
ANTI-THEFT PROGRAMME.

120
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,657
THE FIRST STAGE
IS THE DOOR HANDLE.

121
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,626
YOU WANT TO
MAKE THAT UNFRIENDLY.

122
00:04:53,692 --> 00:04:55,127
YOU KNOW WHAT I SUGGEST?

123
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:58,564
WIRE 'ER UP, LIKE I HAVE,
TO THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER.

124
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,834
YOU PLUG THAT IN
AND WITHIN A COUPLE OF MINUTES,

125
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,169
THAT DOOR HANDLE
GETS BLAZING HOT.

126
00:05:04,236 --> 00:05:06,905
THIS NOT ONLY
MAKES THE BURGLAR UPSET,

127
00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:10,142
IT ENABLES THE COPS
TO CATCH HIM RED-HANDED.

128
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,810
OK, FOR THE NEXT STAGE,

129
00:05:11,877 --> 00:05:15,147
YOU WANT TO DISABLE
YOUR STEERING WHEEL SOMEHOW.

130
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:16,482
GET YOURSELF A CRUTCH.

131
00:05:16,548 --> 00:05:19,118
YOU CAN GET ONE FOR FREE
AT THE WAITING ROOM

132
00:05:19,184 --> 00:05:21,654
AT THE GOUT CLINIC
WHEN NOBODY'S WATCHING.

133
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,656
HOOK THIS UP
TO THE STEERING WHEEL.

134
00:05:23,722 --> 00:05:25,157
(Sizzling)

135
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:26,992
YOW!

136
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:28,394
YOU MOUNT THE CRUTCH

137
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,330
SO IT COMES DOWN
BETWEEN THE DRIVER'S LEGS.

138
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,999
WHEN THE BURGLAR DOES
A LEFT-HAND TURN,

139
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:37,169
HE'LL HAVE TO PULL OVER
FOR MEDICAL ATTENTION.

140
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,138
HERE'S ANOTHER LITTLE FEATURE.

141
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:41,673
I'VE RUN MY RAD HOSE
UP INSIDE THE CAR.

142
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,277
WHEN I LEAVE THE CAR,
I TAKE THE CAP WITH ME.

143
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,780
WHEN THE BURGLAR
STARTS 'ER UP,

144
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:51,116
STEAM GOES ALL OVER HIM --
INSTANT SAUNA.

145
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:52,618
ALL RIGHT.

146
00:05:52,684 --> 00:05:56,755
NOW, WE GOT ANOTHER FEATURE
TO SHOW YOU IN A MINUTE.

147
00:05:56,822 --> 00:05:59,024
OK, YOU WANT
TO FIGURE OUT SOME WAY

148
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:01,393
TO IMPEDE THE ROTATION
OF THE TIRES.

149
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,029
I WOULD THINK ABOUT LETTING
THE AIR OUT,

150
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:06,398
BUT THAT'S INCONVENIENT,
SO INSTEAD,

151
00:06:06,465 --> 00:06:09,902
WHAT YOU DO IS TAKE A NUT OFF
EACH WHEEL ON ONE SIDE,

152
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:11,370
BUT NOT JUST ANY NUTS.

153
00:06:11,436 --> 00:06:14,473
MAKE SURE IT'S THE TWO NUTS
CLOSEST TOGETHER --

154
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,176
THE FARTHEST ONE BACK
ON THE FRONT WHEEL,

155
00:06:17,242 --> 00:06:20,145
AND THE FARTHEST ONE FORWARD
ON THE BACK WHEEL.

156
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:21,647
HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU.

157
00:06:21,713 --> 00:06:23,649
(Cracking)

158
00:06:23,715 --> 00:06:26,151
THAT WAS MY BACK.

159
00:06:26,218 --> 00:06:27,553
ALL RIGHT, THERE WE GO.

160
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:29,354
YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOME CHAIN,

161
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:31,390
WHICH YOU CAN PORK OFF
A TOW TRUCK

162
00:06:31,456 --> 00:06:35,160
WHILE THE GUY'S IN THE DOUGHNUT
SHOP WORKING ON HIS WAISTLINE.

163
00:06:35,227 --> 00:06:36,762
SEE HOW I'VE MOUNTED THESE

164
00:06:36,828 --> 00:06:39,364
TO THE NUTS THAT ARE CLOSEST
TO EACH OTHER?

165
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:42,868
WHEN THE BURGLAR TRIES TO MOVE
THE CAR, THE WHEELS LOCK UP.

166
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,671
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO
TO STAGE FIVE -- ANCHORS.

167
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:49,341
SEE HOW THIS WORKS?

168
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,577
JAM THESE ANCHORS
INTO THE GROUND.

169
00:06:51,643 --> 00:06:54,012
WE'VE ATTACHED ONE
TO THE BACK BUMPER

170
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,981
AND ONE TO THE FRONT BUMPER.

171
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,118
WE'RE READY
FOR THE FINAL STAGE --

172
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:03,855
NOISE CREATION, MORE OR LESS
A SPECIALTY FOR LODGE MEMBERS.

173
00:07:03,922 --> 00:07:06,258
YOU'LL NEED THIS SPECIAL WIRE
THEY USE

174
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:08,327
TO RING THE BELL
AT GAS STATIONS.

175
00:07:08,393 --> 00:07:10,062
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY THIS.

176
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:12,364
MOST STATIONS
LEAVE IT OUT ALL NIGHT,

177
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:16,134
SO CRUISE BY WITH WIRE CUTTERS,
LET NATURE TAKE ITS COURSE.

178
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:17,936
STRIP ONE END OF THE WIRES.

179
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:20,138
CONNECT THESE
TO YOUR HORN RELAY.

180
00:07:20,205 --> 00:07:22,574
MAKE SURE YOU CONNECT
THE RIGHT WIRES

181
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:24,209
TO THE RIGHT TERMINALS.

182
00:07:25,744 --> 00:07:27,179
NO, NO.

183
00:07:27,245 --> 00:07:28,680
THAT'S NOT THE HORN RELAY.

184
00:07:28,747 --> 00:07:30,148
HERE WE GO.

185
00:07:30,215 --> 00:07:34,152
(Horn honking)

186
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:37,055
(Shouting): BOY,
THAT IS LOUD, ISN'T IT?

187
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:39,157
GREAT ACOUSTICS UNDER THERE!

188
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:41,159
ANYBODY SAY ANYTHING?

189
00:07:41,226 --> 00:07:42,594
NO?

190
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:43,662
OK!

191
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:49,568
SPREAD THAT HOSE WHERE
THE BURGLAR WILL STEP ON IT.

192
00:07:49,634 --> 00:07:51,303
THERE'S YOUR ANTI-THEFT CAR.

193
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:52,637
ISN'T THAT GREAT?

194
00:07:52,704 --> 00:07:55,740
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

195
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:58,110
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

196
00:07:58,176 --> 00:08:01,113
I WAS SUPPOSED TO PICK
BERNICE UP AN HOUR AGO!

197
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:03,615
OH! OHHHH!

198
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:06,117
OH!

199
00:08:06,184 --> 00:08:07,619
THERE YOU GO.

200
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:09,120
(Laughing)

201
00:08:09,187 --> 00:08:12,157
(Grunting)

202
00:08:19,397 --> 00:08:22,567
(Horn honking)

203
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:31,877
(Coughing)

204
00:08:31,943 --> 00:08:34,045
STAY TUNED
FOR HAROLD'S HANDICRAFTS.

205
00:08:34,112 --> 00:08:36,214
AND YOU THOUGHT
YOU WERE USELESS.

206
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,688
I THOUGHT "IRONY" WAS
HOW OUR TAPWATER TASTES.

207
00:08:43,755 --> 00:08:45,824
BUSTER HADFIELD
HAD ME CONVINCED

208
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,727
TO GET AN ALARM SYSTEM
INSTALLED IN THE VAN.

209
00:08:48,793 --> 00:08:50,996
HE KNOWS A GUY,
GETS A GOOD PRICE.

210
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:54,466
I THINK THEY MIGHT BE HOT.

211
00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:56,501
HOT? STOLEN CAR ALARMS?

212
00:08:56,568 --> 00:08:58,003
(Laughing)

213
00:08:58,069 --> 00:09:01,806
YOU WANT A CAR ALARM
THAT CAN BE STOLEN?

214
00:09:01,873 --> 00:09:03,174
THE PRICE WAS RIGHT.

215
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:04,643
DOESN'T MATTER ANYWAY.

216
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:07,846
BEFORE I COULD
GET THE THING INSTALLED,

217
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:09,781
SOMEBODY STOLE THE VAN!

218
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:12,017
THEY STOLE
THE POSSUM VAN?!

219
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,519
YEAH.

220
00:09:14,586 --> 00:09:16,087
WHY?

221
00:09:20,091 --> 00:09:24,029
YOU KNOW WHAT THE EFFECT
OF A FIVE-BEAN CHILI IS ON YOU.

222
00:09:24,095 --> 00:09:25,530
(Audience laughing)

223
00:09:25,597 --> 00:09:27,532
WE ALL DO.

224
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:29,100
AND SHE CERTAINLY DOES.

225
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:31,536
SHE WARNED YOU
AT THE COMPANY PICNIC

226
00:09:31,603 --> 00:09:35,039
THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD
TO STAY AWAY FROM THAT CHILI.

227
00:09:35,106 --> 00:09:38,009
YOU HAD TO SAY,
"NO, RELAX, WOULD YOU?

228
00:09:38,076 --> 00:09:40,545
"IT WON'T HURT
TO TRY A LITTLE."

229
00:09:40,612 --> 00:09:43,548
MAYBE A LITTLE
WOULD HAVE BEEN OK,

230
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:46,551
BUT YOU HAD TO HAVE
THE THREE BOWLS.

231
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:48,553
NOW WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

232
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,054
MMM!

233
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:52,023
IF YOU HAD ANY MORE GAS IN YOU,

234
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:55,560
YOU'D BE FLOATING AROUND
WITH A STRING TIED TO YOUR TOE.

235
00:09:55,627 --> 00:09:57,562
(Laughing and applause)

236
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:00,298
AND SHE GETS TO SAY,
"I TOLD YOU SO,"

237
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:03,067
OR SHE WILL,
ONCE THE TROUBLE STARTS.

238
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:04,602
DON'T TAKE THE OFFENSIVE.

239
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:05,937
TAKE THE DEFENSIVE.

240
00:10:06,004 --> 00:10:07,272
BUY YOURSELF A DOG.

241
00:10:07,338 --> 00:10:08,740
STAND RIGHT NEXT TO HIM.

242
00:10:08,806 --> 00:10:10,074
HE'LL COVER FOR YOU.

243
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:12,577
(Laughing and applause)

244
00:10:12,644 --> 00:10:14,379
IF THINGS GET REAL BAD,

245
00:10:14,445 --> 00:10:18,082
BRING IN A PACK OF STRAYS
FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

246
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:21,586
YEAH, OR A TRIP TO THE ZOO
IS GOOD COVER.

247
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:23,087
THE ZOO, THE ZOO.

248
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:24,656
RECENT RESEARCH HAS PROVEN

249
00:10:24,722 --> 00:10:27,025
THAT THE BIGGER AND UGLIER
THE ANIMAL,

250
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:29,027
THE MORE YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH.

251
00:10:29,093 --> 00:10:30,995
THIS IS VERY GOOD ADVICE.

252
00:10:31,062 --> 00:10:33,565
WE KNOW WHAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

253
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:35,033
WE KNOW THE SCORE.

254
00:10:35,099 --> 00:10:38,603
YEAH, WE KNOW
WHICH WAY THE WIND'S BLOWING.

255
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:45,176
ATTENTION, HANDYMEN.

256
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:47,345
THIS IS A FINISHING NAIL.

257
00:10:47,412 --> 00:10:49,447
THIS IS A CONCRETE NAIL.

258
00:10:49,514 --> 00:10:51,215
THIS IS A THUMBNAIL.

259
00:10:51,282 --> 00:10:53,318
DON'T EVER CONFUSE THEM.

260
00:10:53,384 --> 00:10:55,720
WELCOME TO HAROLD GREEN'S
HANDICRAFTS,

261
00:10:55,787 --> 00:10:58,056
WHERE CRAFTY HANDS
MAKE HANDICRAFTS!

262
00:10:58,122 --> 00:10:59,557
(Laughing)

263
00:10:59,624 --> 00:11:03,561
TODAY I'M GONNA BE MAKING
A DECORATIVE DECOY.

264
00:11:03,628 --> 00:11:05,563
AAHHH!

265
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:09,567
NOW, STEP ONE, AS ALWAYS,
IS THE FIRST THING YOU DO,

266
00:11:09,634 --> 00:11:12,603
SO I SUGGEST THAT YOU GET
A PIECE OF WOOD

267
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,172
THAT'S MUCH LARGER

268
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:17,575
THAN THE ACTUAL DECOY
THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE.

269
00:11:17,642 --> 00:11:19,577
(Grunting)

270
00:11:19,644 --> 00:11:22,580
(Audience laughing)

271
00:11:22,647 --> 00:11:24,415
OK, THIS IS STEP ONE.

272
00:11:27,018 --> 00:11:30,421
(Laughing and applause)

273
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:34,525
(Laughing nervously)

274
00:11:34,592 --> 00:11:39,263
NEXT WEEK, I'LL SHOW YOU HOW
TO MAKE A STRONGER WORK BENCH.

275
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,999
IN THE MEANTIME,
LET'S GET CARVING.

276
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:44,769
TO DO THAT,
WE NEED A POCKET KNIFE.

277
00:11:44,836 --> 00:11:47,038
THE POCKET KNIFE IS A, UH...

278
00:11:47,104 --> 00:11:48,573
IT'S A KNIFE, AND, UH...

279
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:50,074
I KNEW WHERE IT WAS

280
00:11:50,141 --> 00:11:53,044
BECAUSE A POCKET KNIFE IS
THE INSTRUMENT OF--

281
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,313
WELL, SEE, THERE YOU ARE.

282
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:58,049
HENCE THE TERM "POCKET KNIFE".

283
00:11:58,115 --> 00:11:59,550
(Laughing)

284
00:11:59,617 --> 00:12:02,053
ALL RIGHT, SO
ONCE YOU GET THIS OPEN,

285
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:03,754
THE BLADE WILL DETERMINE

286
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:06,457
THE STROKE THAT--
THE BLADE WOULD COME OUT

287
00:12:06,524 --> 00:12:08,860
AND THAT'S WHEN
YOU REALLY GET AT IT,

288
00:12:08,926 --> 00:12:10,294
WHEN THE BLADE'S OUT.

289
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:12,430
THAT'S WHEN
THE WHITTLING BEGINS,

290
00:12:12,496 --> 00:12:14,065
I'LL TELL YA, WHEN THE--

291
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:15,499
THAT'S-- THAT--

292
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:17,001
UNCLE RED!

293
00:12:17,068 --> 00:12:19,637
(Laughing nervously)

294
00:12:26,577 --> 00:12:28,012
EXCELLENT.

295
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,513
(Applause)

296
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:34,018
OK, SO YOU HAVE TO DETERMINE
IS IT SHARP?

297
00:12:34,085 --> 00:12:36,320
OH, IF TREES COULD CRY.

298
00:12:36,387 --> 00:12:38,022
ALL RIGHT, NOW...

299
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:40,024
(Audience laughing)

300
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:41,525
YOU GOTTA--

301
00:12:41,592 --> 00:12:43,027
(Grunting)

302
00:12:43,094 --> 00:12:44,562
OH!

303
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:46,631
ALWAYS REMEMBER,
ALWAYS REMEMBER --

304
00:12:46,697 --> 00:12:48,366
THIS IS THE IMPORTANT THING.

305
00:12:48,432 --> 00:12:50,101
CUT WITH THE GRAIN.

306
00:12:53,404 --> 00:12:56,907
(Audience laughing)

307
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:03,147
AND THERE YOU HAVE IT -- VOILA!

308
00:13:03,214 --> 00:13:06,050
THAT WASN'T SO TOUGH, WAS IT?

309
00:13:06,117 --> 00:13:08,352
OK, NOW WE'RE GONNA PAINT IT.

310
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:12,056
WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT
EVEN MORE LOOK LIKE A DUCK.

311
00:13:12,123 --> 00:13:16,060
SO I'M GONNA USE
THIS ORANGE HERE.

312
00:13:16,127 --> 00:13:17,595
I'M GONNA USE ORANGE.

313
00:13:17,661 --> 00:13:19,530
AND THEN YOU CONTINUE
TO PAINT IT

314
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:21,065
IN A DUCK-LIKE FASHION.

315
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:23,200
(Audience laughing)

316
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:31,509
(Audience laughing)

317
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:34,011
THERE YOU HAVE IT!

318
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,414
A BEAUTIFUL DECOY DUCK,
AND YOU MADE IT YOURSELF.

319
00:13:37,481 --> 00:13:38,916
THAT'S THE BEST PART.

320
00:13:38,983 --> 00:13:41,018
CAN'T YOU JUST HEAR IT QUACK?

321
00:13:41,085 --> 00:13:43,087
(Red):
WE SURE CAN!

322
00:13:46,624 --> 00:13:48,626
THE POSSUM VAN
IS STILL MISSING.

323
00:13:48,692 --> 00:13:51,529
THE COPS FOUND BUSTER'S PACER
IN THE RAVINE,

324
00:13:51,595 --> 00:13:54,598
THE INSIDE TOTALLY GUTTED,
JUST TORN TO SHREDS.

325
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:57,434
THE COPS FIGURED
IT WAS SENSELESS VANDALISM

326
00:13:57,501 --> 00:14:00,070
BUT BUSTER SAID
IT WAS LIKE THAT BEFORE.

327
00:14:00,137 --> 00:14:03,607
HAROLD, HE SHOULD GET
HIS DOG'S TOENAILS CLIPPED.

328
00:14:03,674 --> 00:14:06,076
OR GET THAT MUTT
TO STOP LINE-DANCING.

329
00:14:06,143 --> 00:14:08,512
SO NO WORD ON
THE POSSUM VAN, HUH?

330
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:12,549
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO OUT
AND GET YOURSELF A NEW ONE.

331
00:14:12,616 --> 00:14:14,585
NO, I DON'T
WANT A NEW VAN.

332
00:14:14,652 --> 00:14:16,086
I WANT
MY OLD VAN.

333
00:14:16,153 --> 00:14:17,621
I LOVE
THAT VAN.

334
00:14:17,688 --> 00:14:19,523
NEW VANS ARE GREAT, TOO.

335
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:22,092
THEY DON'T SMELL
LIKE A WET GOAT.

336
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,961
NO, HAROLD,
MY VAN IS A CLASSIC.

337
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:26,163
MADE VANS BETTER
BACK IN THOSE DAYS.

338
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,766
YOU KNOW, THE OLD-FASHIONED
WORKMANSHIP...

339
00:14:28,832 --> 00:14:31,135
CRAFTSPEOPLE TOOK PRIDE
IN THEIR WORK.

340
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:34,638
1985 -- THE GOLDEN AGE
OF AUTOMOBILES, WAS IT?

341
00:14:34,705 --> 00:14:38,008
BESIDES, TODAY, ALL THEY GOT
IS THOSE MINIVANS.

342
00:14:38,075 --> 00:14:39,677
MEN ARE NOT COMFORTABLE

343
00:14:39,743 --> 00:14:42,546
IF ANYTHING'S GOT
THE WORD "MINI" IN IT.

344
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:44,515
WELL, HOW ABOUT
MINISKIRTS?

345
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:48,485
WELL, NOW, TO MY GENERATION,
THOSE ARE FOR WOMEN, HAROLD.

346
00:14:48,552 --> 00:14:50,854
MINISKIRT, MINIVAN,
MINNIE MOUSE...

347
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:54,425
THERE'S NOT AN OUNCE
OF TESTOSTERONE IN THE BUNCH.

348
00:14:56,894 --> 00:15:00,564
IN HONOUR OF ME LOSING MY VAN,
BILL BROUGHT OVER A UNICYCLE.

349
00:15:00,631 --> 00:15:02,199
NO, THAT'S TOO HARD.

350
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:03,634
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

351
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,869
BILL SEEMS TO STORE EVERYTHING

352
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:07,905
HE DOESN'T USE IN HIS PANTS.

353
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:10,574
THAT'S AMAZING --
HOW DID HE DO THAT?

354
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:12,109
HE'S GOT SOMETHING ELSE.

355
00:15:12,176 --> 00:15:13,544
MY GOSH, WHAT IS THAT?

356
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,579
SOME MEDICAL PIECE OF EQUIPMENT

357
00:15:15,646 --> 00:15:17,247
OF SOME KIND?

358
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:18,749
WHAT IS IT?

359
00:15:18,816 --> 00:15:20,217
OH, FOR GOSH SAKES!

360
00:15:20,284 --> 00:15:24,021
WELL, MUST BE SOME KIND
OF SPECIAL MATERIAL.

361
00:15:24,087 --> 00:15:25,756
YES, ANYWAY, IT'S--

362
00:15:25,823 --> 00:15:29,493
OK, YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
I GET THE IDEA, BILL.

363
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,995
BICYCLE BUILT FOR TWO,
HALF THE PEDALLING.

364
00:15:32,062 --> 00:15:34,565
THE ONLY THING
I DON'T LIKE IS -- OW --

365
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:37,034
BILL'S GOT THE BRAKES
AND STEERING.

366
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,336
ALL I GOTTA DO--
OK, AWAY WE GO.

367
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:41,338
THE THING--
YEAH, THAT'S THE HORN.

368
00:15:41,405 --> 00:15:44,608
WHAT I DIDN'T REALIZE IS THAT
IF YOU DON'T--

369
00:15:44,675 --> 00:15:47,010
BILL, WE'RE PEDALLING
BACKWARDS.

370
00:15:47,077 --> 00:15:48,512
BILL, WE GOT OFF ON THE--

371
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:50,113
OH, OH, OH!

372
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,216
BY GOLLY, NOW,

373
00:15:52,282 --> 00:15:53,550
AT LEAST I--

374
00:15:53,617 --> 00:15:55,052
LOOK OUT, LOOK OUT!

375
00:15:55,118 --> 00:15:56,553
OK, FINE.

376
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,856
I'M THINKING I DON'T HAVE
CONTROL OVER ANYTHING,

377
00:15:59,923 --> 00:16:01,358
ESPECIALLY BILL.

378
00:16:01,425 --> 00:16:02,993
THEN I REALIZE I'VE GOT

379
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,361
A BACK-PEDAL BRAKE.

380
00:16:04,428 --> 00:16:06,463
OH, BOY, UP SHE COMES!

381
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,065
OH, DOWN SHE GOES!

382
00:16:08,131 --> 00:16:10,267
BILL'S GOT THE BALANCE
FROM HIS UNICYCLE DAYS.

383
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:11,768
LOOK AT THAT.

384
00:16:11,835 --> 00:16:13,303
LOOK AT THAT SHOW-OFF.

385
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,705
THAT'S AN ODD THING.

386
00:16:14,771 --> 00:16:16,540
YOU PRAY FOR A LOW BRIDGE.

387
00:16:16,607 --> 00:16:18,675
THERE'S A ROCK THERE, BILL!

388
00:16:18,742 --> 00:16:20,010
LOOK OUT!

389
00:16:20,077 --> 00:16:21,478
YOU ALL RIGHT, BILL?

390
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:23,013
HONK IF YOU LOVE FUN.

391
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,514
(Laughing)

392
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:26,583
OH, YOU'RE FINE.

393
00:16:28,352 --> 00:16:31,321
STAY TUNED --
HAROLD HAS GOOD NEWS!

394
00:16:31,388 --> 00:16:32,889
OH, MAN.

395
00:16:36,994 --> 00:16:38,662
LOOKED AT THEM NEW VANS.

396
00:16:38,729 --> 00:16:41,531
COUPLE OF THOSE BABIES
ARE PRETTY SHARP.

397
00:16:41,598 --> 00:16:44,134
THEY LOANED ME ONE
TO USE FOR A DAY.

398
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:47,137
YEAH, IT REALLY DOES
LOOK SHARP.

399
00:16:47,204 --> 00:16:48,638
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

400
00:16:48,705 --> 00:16:50,040
I-I-IT'S NOT
VERY BIG, THOUGH.

401
00:16:50,107 --> 00:16:52,275
OH, IT'S BIG ENOUGH --
SEVEN-PASSENGER.

402
00:16:52,342 --> 00:16:53,744
OH, YEAH,
BUT I MEAN,

403
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:56,046
FROM THE OUTSIDE,
IT'S NOT VERY BIG.

404
00:16:56,113 --> 00:16:58,248
IT'S ALMOST LIKE, UH...
A MINIVAN.

405
00:16:58,315 --> 00:17:01,284
IF A PERSON SAW IT,
THEY'D THINK IT'S A... MINIVAN.

406
00:17:01,351 --> 00:17:02,619
NO.

407
00:17:02,686 --> 00:17:04,855
IF THEY SAW IT, THEY'D ASSUME

408
00:17:04,921 --> 00:17:08,358
YOU WERE THINKING OF PURCHASING
A... MINIVAN.

409
00:17:08,425 --> 00:17:12,062
I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER YOU SAYING
THAT MINIVANS ARE FOR WOMEN.

410
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:13,396
IS THAT A MINIVAN?

411
00:17:13,463 --> 00:17:15,732
(Audience laughing)

412
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:18,902
WELL, TECHNICALLY, YES,
IT IS TECHNICALLY A MINIVAN.

413
00:17:18,969 --> 00:17:20,237
OHHHHH!

414
00:17:20,303 --> 00:17:23,340
BUT, HAROLD, TECHNICALLY,
YOU'RE A HUMAN BEING

415
00:17:23,406 --> 00:17:27,043
SO THERE'S A LOT OF LEEWAY
WITH TECHNICAL DEFINITIONS.

416
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,246
ALL RIGHT, GET BALANCED.

417
00:17:29,312 --> 00:17:31,248
KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN.

418
00:17:31,314 --> 00:17:32,849
SLOWLY ON THE BACK SWING.

419
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,618
KEEP THE LEFT ARM STRAIGHT.

420
00:17:34,684 --> 00:17:36,887
STOP AT THE VERY TOP,
AND ACCELERATE

421
00:17:36,953 --> 00:17:39,322
AS YOU COME THROUGH
AND MAKE CONTACT.

422
00:17:41,424 --> 00:17:43,960
WELCOME TO THE EXPERTS PORTION.

423
00:17:44,027 --> 00:17:46,830
THIS WEEK'S EXPERTS
IS MY UNCLE RED

424
00:17:46,897 --> 00:17:49,766
AND HIS GOOD FRIEND
MR. WINSTON ROTHSCHILD.

425
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:54,371
(Applause and cheering)

426
00:17:54,437 --> 00:17:57,774
OK, FIRST LETTER
GOES AS FOLLOWS:

427
00:17:57,841 --> 00:17:59,409
"DEAR EXPERTS...

428
00:17:59,476 --> 00:18:03,213
"MY SON HAS DECIDED HE DOESN'T
WANT TO FOLLOW IN MY FOOTSTEPS.

429
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,149
"I WANT HIM TO JOIN
THE FAMILY BUSINESS,

430
00:18:06,216 --> 00:18:07,884
"BUT HE HAS OTHER IDEAS.

431
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:09,219
"WHAT CAN I DO?"

432
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:10,553
WAHHHH!

433
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,957
I GUESS YOU HAVE TO START
LIVING WITH THE FACT

434
00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:15,959
YOUR SON HAS HIS OWN LIFE.

435
00:18:16,026 --> 00:18:17,460
WELL, THAT'S
NO KIND

436
00:18:17,527 --> 00:18:18,795
OF ADVICE, HAROLD.

437
00:18:18,862 --> 00:18:21,164
A MAN'S PAYING A COMPLIMENT
TO HIS SON,

438
00:18:21,231 --> 00:18:23,500
INVITING HIM
INTO THE FAMILY BUSINESS.

439
00:18:23,566 --> 00:18:26,236
THIS IS A SHOW OF FATHERLY LOVE
WE'RE LOOKING AT.

440
00:18:26,302 --> 00:18:27,804
AM I RIGHT, WINSTON?

441
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:30,573
YEAH, OF ALL THE TIMES
I WISHED MY OLD MAN

442
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,977
HAD BROUGHT ME INTO HIS FAMILY
BUSINESS, INSTEAD OF

443
00:18:34,044 --> 00:18:37,347
GETTING ME TO BRING HIM
ASHTRAYS AND BOTTLE OPENERS

444
00:18:37,414 --> 00:18:39,582
AND GOING TO ANSWER
THE FRONT DOOR

445
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:42,052
AND TELLING THE COPS
HE WASN'T THERE.

446
00:18:42,118 --> 00:18:43,586
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.

447
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:46,456
IF MY SON ASKED TO BE
IN THE FAMILY BUSINESS,

448
00:18:46,523 --> 00:18:48,725
I'D DO ANYTHING
TO GET HIM IN THERE.

449
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:51,161
I'D MAKE FUN
OF EVERYTHING ELSE HE DID.

450
00:18:51,227 --> 00:18:52,929
I'D CUT HIM OUT OF THE WILL

451
00:18:52,996 --> 00:18:55,198
AND THREATEN HIM
AND SLASH HIS TIRES

452
00:18:55,265 --> 00:18:57,534
IF HE DIDN'T COME
INTO THE BUSINESS.

453
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,136
IN A FRIENDLY WAY,
MAKE HIM TOE THE LINE.

454
00:19:00,203 --> 00:19:02,272
WELL, I COMPLETELY DISAGREE.

455
00:19:02,338 --> 00:19:04,274
WAHHH!

456
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,775
(Audience laughing)

457
00:19:05,842 --> 00:19:08,578
I MEAN, IF YOU ASK ME,
I WOULD DISAGREE.

458
00:19:08,645 --> 00:19:11,447
I THINK THE SON
SHOULD LEAD HIS OWN LIFE,

459
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:13,550
LIKE MR. ROTHSCHILD DOES.

460
00:19:13,616 --> 00:19:15,018
WELL,
I GOTTA ADMIT,

461
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:16,419
I GOT NO REGRETS, EH?

462
00:19:16,486 --> 00:19:19,289
SURE, I FLOUNDERED AROUND THERE
FOR A WHILE,

463
00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:20,957
HAD MY SHARE OF FAILURES.

464
00:19:21,024 --> 00:19:23,960
AT ONE POINT, I WANTED
TO BE A BANK PRESIDENT,

465
00:19:24,027 --> 00:19:27,096
THEN A SUPREME COURT JUDGE,
AND THEN I JUST DOVE

466
00:19:27,163 --> 00:19:28,598
INTO THE SEWAGE BUSINESS

467
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:31,367
AND I'VE BEEN
UP TO MY EYEBROWS EVER SINCE.

468
00:19:31,434 --> 00:19:33,269
(Audience laughing)

469
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:34,837
IT WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTING

470
00:19:34,904 --> 00:19:36,673
THAT THE OLD MAN
NEVER ASKED ME.

471
00:19:36,739 --> 00:19:38,174
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.

472
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:41,010
IF I HAD A KID,
HE'D BE MORE THAN WELCOME

473
00:19:41,077 --> 00:19:43,313
TO JOIN ME
IN MY FAMILY BUSINESS.

474
00:19:43,379 --> 00:19:46,883
HE MIGHT NOT BE INTERESTED
IN STARTING AT THE BOTTOM.

475
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,185
WHATEVER -- I THINK
THE POINT HERE IS

476
00:19:49,252 --> 00:19:51,521
THAT SOME SONS JUST, YOU KNOW,

477
00:19:51,588 --> 00:19:54,090
DON'T MEASURE UP
TO THEIR FATHERS.

478
00:19:54,157 --> 00:19:57,327
SOMETIMES THE SON IS FIVE TIMES
THE MAN HIS FATHER IS.

479
00:19:57,393 --> 00:19:59,329
YEAH, YOURS
WILL BE.

480
00:19:59,395 --> 00:20:02,832
(Laughing and applause)

481
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:05,702
HAROLD?

482
00:20:05,768 --> 00:20:09,172
ALL RIGHT, HE'S NOT HERE,
BUT KIND OF MADE UP MY MIND

483
00:20:09,238 --> 00:20:11,941
THAT I'M GONNA GO AHEAD
WITH THIS NEW VAN.

484
00:20:12,008 --> 00:20:15,244
SOMETHING ABOUT THE SMELL
OF A NEW VEHICLE, THERE,

485
00:20:15,311 --> 00:20:17,947
AND BOY, THE CONTROLS
ARE SOMETHING ELSE.

486
00:20:18,014 --> 00:20:20,083
THIS THING'S GOT
MORE ADJUSTMENTS

487
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:22,185
ON THE WINDSHIELD WIPER CONTROL

488
00:20:22,251 --> 00:20:25,288
THAN THE POSSUM VAN HAD
ON THE WHOLE DASHBOARD.

489
00:20:25,355 --> 00:20:29,292
EVEN JUST TO HAVE THE CARPETING
ALL THE ONE COLOUR, YOU KNOW?

490
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:31,961
IT'S A CRIME THAT
THE POSSUM VAN WAS STOLEN,

491
00:20:32,028 --> 00:20:33,296
BUT LIFE GOES ON,

492
00:20:33,363 --> 00:20:36,299
SO I'LL DUCK OUT EARLY,
GET DOWN TO THE DEALERSHIP

493
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:37,800
AND I THINK I'M--

494
00:20:37,867 --> 00:20:39,635
UNCLE RED, UNCLE RED!

495
00:20:39,702 --> 00:20:41,771
UNCLE RED, UNCLE RED,
UNCLE RED!

496
00:20:41,838 --> 00:20:44,373
UNCLE RED, UNCLE RED,
UNCLE RED, UNCLE RED!

497
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,309
UNCLE RED, UNCLE RED,
UNCLE RED!

498
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,810
WHAT?

499
00:20:47,877 --> 00:20:49,312
THEY FOUND THE POSSUM VAN!

500
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:51,614
WAHHHH!

501
00:20:51,681 --> 00:20:53,316
ISN'T THAT
GREAT?

502
00:20:53,382 --> 00:20:55,718
YEAH, IT'S GOOD, YEAH.

503
00:20:55,785 --> 00:20:58,421
IT WASN'T EVEN STOLEN,
WASN'T EVEN STOLEN.

504
00:20:58,488 --> 00:20:59,922
IT WAS BUSTER HADFIELD.

505
00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:03,226
HIS FRIEND WAS GONNA SELL YOU
THE CAR ALARM SYSTEM.

506
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:04,694
BUSTER BORROWED THE VAN

507
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,697
AND HE'S GONNA HAVE THE SYSTEM
PUT IN AS A SURPRISE.

508
00:21:07,763 --> 00:21:09,198
YOU LOVE THAT VAN.

509
00:21:09,265 --> 00:21:10,700
IT'S BACK!

510
00:21:10,766 --> 00:21:12,768
YEAH, NO, YEAH, OH, YEAH, NO.

511
00:21:12,835 --> 00:21:16,272
HAROLD, I'M THINKING
THE SAFETY'S NOT UP TO SNUFF.

512
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:19,542
THE NEW VANS, THEY GOT
THE DRIVER'S-SIDE AIRBAG

513
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:21,711
AND THE A.B.S. BRAKING SYSTEM.

514
00:21:21,777 --> 00:21:24,480
THE GUY WHO NEVER WEARS
A SEATBELT IS MR. SAFETY?

515
00:21:24,547 --> 00:21:26,148
IT'S NOT JUST THE SAFETY.

516
00:21:26,215 --> 00:21:28,351
THE NEW VANS HAVE
AIR CONDITIONING

517
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:30,953
AND THE SEEK-CONTROL BUTTON
ON THE RADIO

518
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,488
AND COFFEE-MUG HOLDERS.

519
00:21:32,555 --> 00:21:34,757
WE'RE INTO A NEW AGE
OF TECHNOLOGY.

520
00:21:34,824 --> 00:21:36,559
BUT YOU LOVE
THE POSSUM VAN.

521
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:39,061
YEAH, BUT IT'S A PIECE OF CRAP,

522
00:21:39,128 --> 00:21:41,397
BASICALLY.

523
00:21:41,464 --> 00:21:42,898
YOU SAID IT'S A CLASSIC.

524
00:21:42,965 --> 00:21:44,333
IT'S GOT A V-8 ENGINE,

525
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,069
LOTS OF CARGO SPACE,
STILL RUNS PRETTY WELL.

526
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,537
IT'S A GOOD, SOLID VAN.

527
00:21:48,604 --> 00:21:50,106
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO BUY IT?

528
00:21:50,172 --> 00:21:51,440
NO.

529
00:21:51,507 --> 00:21:54,810
(Laughing)

530
00:21:54,877 --> 00:21:56,312
(Possum squeal)

531
00:21:56,379 --> 00:21:59,281
IT'S MEETING TIME, UNCLE RED.

532
00:21:59,348 --> 00:22:01,317
YOU GO AHEAD, HAROLD.

533
00:22:01,384 --> 00:22:07,757
(Laughing)

534
00:22:07,823 --> 00:22:09,759
THINK IT OVER.

535
00:22:09,825 --> 00:22:11,861
(Laughing)

536
00:22:11,927 --> 00:22:13,396
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

537
00:22:13,462 --> 00:22:16,232
I'M COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

538
00:22:16,298 --> 00:22:18,868
I'VE BEEN DOING
A LITTLE THINKING LATELY

539
00:22:18,934 --> 00:22:22,405
ABOUT HOW YOU KIND OF GET
THE SHORT END OF THE STICK.

540
00:22:22,471 --> 00:22:25,508
I'M THINKING HOW MUCH EASIER
YOUR LIFE WOULD BE

541
00:22:25,574 --> 00:22:27,309
IF YOU HAD A BRAND-NEW VAN.

542
00:22:27,376 --> 00:22:29,879
I'M GONNA BE BRINGING ONE HOME
TONIGHT,

543
00:22:29,945 --> 00:22:33,616
BUT I ALSO KNOW HOW NERVOUS
YOU GET WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING,

544
00:22:33,682 --> 00:22:35,017
SO I'M THINKING MAYBE

545
00:22:35,084 --> 00:22:38,154
WHY DON'T YOU DRIVE
THE POSSUM VAN FOR A WHILE,

546
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,824
AND I'LL DRIVE THE NEW MINIVAN,
JUST FOR A LITTLE BIT...

547
00:22:41,891 --> 00:22:43,159
TILL IT'S PAID FOR.

548
00:22:43,225 --> 00:22:45,895
THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

549
00:22:45,961 --> 00:22:49,198
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND HAROLD AND THE GANG,

550
00:22:49,265 --> 00:22:51,300
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

551
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:54,703
(Applause and cheering)

552
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,539
(Possum squeal)

553
00:22:56,605 --> 00:22:58,040
OH, HURRY UP!

554
00:22:58,107 --> 00:23:00,876
HEY, STAND UP,
STAND UP!

555
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:07,249
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

556
00:23:07,316 --> 00:23:11,587
SIT DOWN, BOYS.
