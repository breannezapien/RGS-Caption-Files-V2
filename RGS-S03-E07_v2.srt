'HANDYMAN CORNER' WE'RE

120
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:48,027
GOING TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING

121
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,428
FUN YOU CAN DO WITH A BED.

122
00:03:49,428 --> 00:03:50,162
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE

123
00:03:50,162 --> 00:03:51,130
OVER 50 AND ARE LOOKING

124
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,466
FOR ALTERNATIVES.

125
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,366
I GOT THIS IDEA WHEN I WAS

126
00:03:54,366 --> 00:03:55,267
STUCK IN A TRAFFIC JAM OUT

127
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:56,402
ON THE HIGHWAY, THEY HAD ONE

128
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,603
OF THEM BIG MACHINES THAT'S

129
00:03:57,603 --> 00:03:58,904
LIKE A ONE STEP DEAL THAT

130
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:00,272
BREAKS UP THE ASPHALT AND

131
00:04:00,272 --> 00:04:01,507
PULLS IT INTO THE THING,

132
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,675
AND IT MELTS IT DOWN

133
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:03,642
AND THEN IT PUTS IT BACK

134
00:04:03,642 --> 00:04:04,777
DOWN AND ROLLS IT FLAT.

135
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:05,845
AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF MAYBE

136
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:07,313
WE COULD THE SAME THING

137
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,180
FOR GARDENING,

138
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,149
A ONE STEP MACHINE,

139
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,450
AND I GOT THIS ANTIQUE BED,

140
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,351
IT WAS LEFT OVER FROM OLD MAN

141
00:04:12,351 --> 00:04:13,652
SEDGEWICK'S HONEYMOON SO I KNEW

142
00:04:13,652 --> 00:04:14,420
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY

143
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,358
ABOUT METAL FATIGUE.

144
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,793
ALL RIGHT NOW STEP ONE,

145
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:21,760
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS GET

146
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,963
YOURSELF AN OUTBOARD MOTOR

147
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,899
AND MOUNT THIS TO THE FOOTBOARD

148
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,468
OR AS WE CALL IT THE TRANSOM.

149
00:04:29,468 --> 00:04:30,436
OKAY AND WHEN YOU MOUNT IT

150
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,337
MOUNT IT WITH THE PROP GOING

151
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,538
FORWARD BECAUSE THIS HERE IS

152
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:34,039
GOING TO BE YOUR CULTIVATOR.

153
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:36,642
NOW IF YOU GOT THE LOOM

154
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:38,477
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET BY

155
00:04:38,477 --> 00:04:40,513
WITH SAY A 9.5 EVINRUDE SET

156
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:41,881
FOR TROLLING, BUT IF YOUR YARD

157
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:45,050
IS FULL OF CLAY AND STONES

158
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,352
AND MAYBE A COUPLE OF BURIED

159
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:47,653
WOODSTOVES, YOU MIGHT HAVE

160
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:49,088
TO MOVE UP TO A 300 HORSE

161
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:50,389
MERCRUISER OR A V6 WITH TRIM

162
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:52,024
TABS AND POWER TILT,

163
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:52,958
MAYBE GET THE PROP OFF

164
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,327
A CESSNA 150, BUT EITHER

165
00:04:55,327 --> 00:04:57,529
WAY WHATEVER ENGINE YOU USE

166
00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:58,330
YOU'RE GOING TO MOUNT IT UNTO

167
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,265
THE BED USING EXACTLY

168
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:03,602

169
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:04,870

171
00:05:06,438 --> 00:05:07,339
NOW IF YOU GO WITH THE BIG MOTOR

172
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:08,374
ON THIS YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE

173
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,209
SAY 2 OR 3 ROLLS OF DUCT TAPE

174
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,243
AND THEN REALLY SECURE DOWN

175
00:05:11,243 --> 00:05:12,911
MAYBE A 100 POUND TEST LINE

176
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:13,712
OR EVEN A COUPLE OF

177
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:15,314
COAT HANGERS.

178
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:16,882
NOW I'VE USED THE SAME TECHNIQUE

179
00:05:16,882 --> 00:05:18,684
TO ATTACH THESE COAT RACKS TO

180
00:05:18,684 --> 00:05:19,685
THE SIDES OF THE FOOTBOARD

181
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:20,786
AND WE GOT A COUPLE OF

182
00:05:20,786 --> 00:05:23,322
HOT WATER BOTTLES HUNG HERE.

183
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:24,490
WE REALLY STRIPPED DOWN OLD

184
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,324
MAN SEDGEWICK'S ROOM FOR THIS

185
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:28,260
PROJECT AND WE GOT PLANT FOOD

186
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,228
IN THIS ONE AND WE GOT WEED

187
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:29,995
KILLER IN THIS ONE AND THEN

188
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:31,296
THEY COME DOWN THROUGH

189
00:05:31,296 --> 00:05:32,665
THESE HOSES, IT'S A GRAVITY FEED

190
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,901
KIND OF LIKE MOOSE THOMPSON

191
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:36,835
ON SPAGHETTI NIGHT.

192
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:39,004
AND THE 2 CHEMICALS,

193
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:40,105
THEY'RE JOINED TOGETHER INTO

194
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:41,473
THIS BEDPAN WHERE THEY'RE

195
00:05:41,473 --> 00:05:43,509
TURNED INTO FERTILIZER,

196
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:47,146
KIND OF APRES POE ISN'T IT?

197
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,814
NOW I HAVE ADDED A READING

198
00:05:48,814 --> 00:05:51,917
LIGHT TO THE COAT RACK THERE,

199
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:52,785
I MEAN WHAT WE'D EVER NEED

200
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,086
A READING LIGHT AT THE

201
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:55,654
LODGE FOR IS BEYOND ME.

202
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:57,122
THIS ALLOWS US TO DO OUR

203
00:05:57,122 --> 00:05:58,123
PLANTING AT NIGHT AND THE HOT

204
00:05:58,123 --> 00:05:59,491
WATER BOTTLES ARE ALL SET TO

205
00:05:59,491 --> 00:06:01,427
GO HERE AND I'VE ADDED AN

206
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:02,895
UMBRELLA FOR A LITTLE EXTRA

207
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:03,862
PROTECTION WHICH IS SOMETHING

208
00:06:03,862 --> 00:06:04,830
YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT

209
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,099
WHEN YOU'RE NEAR A BED.

210
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:08,400
AND NOW THESE PILLOWCASES

211
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,169
I'VE MOUNTED ON THE BACK HERE.

212
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,971
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS,

213
00:06:12,971 --> 00:06:13,839
I FILLED THE ONE,

214
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,107
I'LL JUST TOP THIS BABY UP

215
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:18,177
WITH SOME FLOWER SEEDS AND

216
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:18,977
THEN THE SEEDS COME OUT THE

217
00:06:18,977 --> 00:06:19,711
HOLE IN THE BOTTOM PLANTING

218
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:23,148
FLOWERS AS WE GO.

219
00:06:23,148 --> 00:06:24,116
I GOT SOME BULBS HERE AND

220
00:06:24,116 --> 00:06:25,184
I'LL JUST FILL UP MY POCKETS

221
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:28,153
WITH THE BULBS AND WHAT I CAN

OH I MISSED THE BED!

226
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:35,994
WE USE TO DO THAT AS KIDS

227
00:06:35,994 --> 00:06:38,797
BUT OF COURSE WE USED HAMSTERS.

228
00:06:38,797 --> 00:06:39,731
WE'RE ABOUT RIGHT,

229
00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:40,532
DO YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:41,400
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK

231
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,200

00:11:06,864 --> 00:11:07,765
>>RED: YEAH I'M SURE OF IT,

391
00:11:07,765 --> 00:11:09,667

392
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:10,635
>>BUZZ: (SHOUTING) FIRE!

394
00:11:39,797 --> 00:11:42,133
>>HAROLD: OH UNCLE RED,

395
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:44,502
HAD A LITTLE PROBLEM WITH

396
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:52,610
THE VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT?

397
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,611
>>RED: WELL WE GOT REAL LUCKY

398
00:11:53,611 --> 00:11:56,948
OUT THERE, I JUST FINISHED

399
00:11:56,948 --> 00:12:00,351
FORMING THE WHOLE VOLUNTEER

400
00:12:00,351 --> 00:12:00,985
FIRE DEPARTMENT AND SUDDENLY

401
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:04,722
ONE OF THE VEHICLES CAUGHT FIRE,

402
00:12:04,722 --> 00:12:07,325
SO TALK ABOUT GOOD TIMING.

403
00:12:07,325 --> 00:12:08,226
>>HAROLD: IT WASN'T

404
00:12:08,226 --> 00:12:08,860
THE POSSUM VAN WAS IT?

405
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,527
>>RED: NO, NO HAROLD,

406
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:10,862
THE POSSUM VAN WON'T BURN,

407
00:12:10,862 --> 00:12:12,597
BELIEVE ME I'VE TRIED

408
00:12:12,597 --> 00:12:15,900
THAT A 1,000 TIMES.

409
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,201
NOW UNFORTUNATELY WE COULDN'T

410
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:18,035
SAVE THE VEHICLE BUT WE DID

411
00:12:18,035 --> 00:12:19,070
PREVENT THE FIRE FROM

412
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,473
SPREADING TO ANYTHING ELSE.

413
00:12:22,473 --> 00:12:23,174
>>HAROLD: IT WAS THE

414
00:12:23,174 --> 00:12:33,851
FIRE TRUCK WASN'T IT?

415
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:35,586
THAT'S A YES.

416
00:12:35,586 --> 00:12:36,320
>>RED: WELL THE TROUBLE

417
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,254
STARTED WHEN BUSTER AND STINKY,

418
00:12:37,254 --> 00:12:38,122
THEY BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE OLD

419
00:12:38,122 --> 00:12:39,256
STREET CLEANERS TO USE AS

420
00:12:39,256 --> 00:12:41,659
A FIRE TRUCK BECAUSE IT CARRIES

421
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:43,194
WATER AND WE FIGURED WITH THAT

422
00:12:43,194 --> 00:12:44,028
SWEEPER IN THE FRONT IT OUGHT

423
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:47,765
TO BE GOOD FOR BUSH FIRES.

424
00:12:47,765 --> 00:12:49,900
OF COURSE THEY BROUGHT HER

425
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,634
UP TO THE LODGE, SHE WAS

426
00:12:50,634 --> 00:12:51,369
BRIGHT YELLOW AND SO THEY

427
00:12:51,369 --> 00:12:52,203
PAINTED HER ALL RED AND THEN

428
00:12:52,203 --> 00:12:53,104
THEY FOUND OUT THAT THE FIRE

429
00:12:53,104 --> 00:12:54,038
DEPARTMENTS NOW ARE PAINTING

430
00:12:54,038 --> 00:12:55,439
THEIRS BRIGHT YELLOW SO THEY

431
00:12:55,439 --> 00:12:58,009
PAINTED HER BRIGHT YELLOW

432
00:12:58,009 --> 00:12:58,876
AND THEN THEY FOUND OUT THAT

433
00:12:58,876 --> 00:12:59,944
THAT'S ONLY THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS

434
00:12:59,944 --> 00:13:00,911
IN THE CITY AND THAT THE ONES

435
00:13:00,911 --> 00:13:02,413
OUT IN THE COUNTRY ARE PAINTING

436
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:04,048
THEM RED, IT SHOWS UP BETTER

437
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:05,983
OR SOMETHING...

438
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:07,051
BUT THE YELLOW PAINT HADN'T

439
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:08,619
DRIED YET AND SO THAT WAS

440
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:10,321
THE YELLOW ON THE RED ON

441
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:11,222
THE YELLOW AND SO WHAT THEY

442
00:13:11,222 --> 00:13:13,090
DID WAS THEY PAINTED HER AGAIN

443
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,291
BUT THIS TIME WITH A QUICK

444
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,193
DRYING RED LACQUER.

445
00:13:16,193 --> 00:13:17,495
>>HAROLD: EXCUSE ME UNCLE RED,

446
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:18,562
I WOULD THINK THAT THAT WOULD

447
00:13:18,562 --> 00:13:20,331
MAKE THE PAINT RUN LIKE

448
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:21,799
WATER WOULDN'T IT?

449
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:22,666
>>RED: WELL YEAH I WOULD THINK

450
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:23,601
SO TOO HAROLD BUT THEN OUR

451
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:24,468
BRAINS AREN'T CLOGGED WITH

452
00:13:24,468 --> 00:13:29,140
PAINT FUMES ARE THEY?

453
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,908
SO NOW WHAT WE HAD WAS

454
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:32,042
3 PAINT JOBS SLIDING OFF

455
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:33,110
THE TRUCK AND HEADING

456
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,313
OUT TOWARDS THE LAKE,

457
00:13:36,313 --> 00:13:37,414
AND I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE

458
00:13:37,414 --> 00:13:38,782
MADE IT TOO BUT THEY CROSSED

459
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:43,420
PATHS WITH THE BARBEQUE.

460
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,255
>>HAROLD: OH THAT'S WHEN

461
00:13:44,255 --> 00:13:45,656
THE FIRE STARTED RIGHT?

462
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:49,627
>>RED: RIGHT AROUND THAT TIME.

463
00:13:49,627 --> 00:13:50,794
SO NOW THE TRUCK IS NOT REALLY

464
00:13:50,794 --> 00:13:53,297
YELLOW ON RED OR RED ON YELLOW,

465
00:13:53,297 --> 00:13:57,034
IT'S MORE OF A BASIC BLACK.

466
00:13:57,034 --> 00:13:58,102
AND THE BIG QUESTION IS WHAT

467
00:13:58,102 --> 00:13:58,936
DO YOU DO WITH A USELESS,

468
00:13:58,936 --> 00:14:01,939
BURNT OUT WRECK?

469
00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:02,773
>>HAROLD: WELL YOU COULD MAKE

470
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:07,278

483
00:14:34,605 --> 00:14:41,478
BILL'S COOKING LUNCH TO GO,

484
00:14:41,478 --> 00:14:42,980
NO BILL THE BARBEQUE'S GONE

485
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,815
THERE I FELT BAD ABOUT THAT,

486
00:14:44,815 --> 00:14:46,350
I'M SORRY BILL.

487
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,151
BUT IT'S TIME FOR ANOTHER

488
00:14:47,151 --> 00:14:49,353
ADVENTURE ANYHOW.

489
00:14:49,353 --> 00:14:50,320
I HOPE I DIDN'T RUIN THINGS

490
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,989
TOO BAD BY KIND OF TOTALLING

491
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:53,257
THE BARBEQUE.

492
00:14:53,257 --> 00:14:54,124
OH NO, LOOK, OH NO,

493
00:14:54,124 --> 00:14:55,392
NOW THESE ARE KIND OF A

494
00:14:55,392 --> 00:14:56,760
SIMPLE UNIT THESE BARBEQUES

495
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,661
AND I DON'T THINK YOU CAN REALLY

496
00:14:57,661 --> 00:14:58,762
HURT THEM TOO BAD THOUGH,

497
00:14:58,762 --> 00:15:00,864
WE CAN PUT HER BACK TOGETHER

498
00:15:00,864 --> 00:15:03,033
AND I'D FEEL BETTER ABOUT THAT,

499
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:03,867
AND HERE YOU GO BILL

500
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:04,802
EVERYTHING'S FINE,

501
00:15:04,802 --> 00:15:06,370
PUT THAT IN THERE AND I WONDER

502
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,771
WHAT HE'S PLANNING TO COOK TODAY

503
00:15:07,771 --> 00:15:08,906
BECAUSE I WAS FEELING A LITTLE

00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:20,884
WELL NOW HE SAYS TO ME,

510
00:15:20,884 --> 00:15:21,885

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,188

513
00:15:24,188 --> 00:15:25,022
WE GOT TO DO IS CLEAR ALL

514
00:15:25,022 --> 00:15:29,026
THE LEAVES.

515
00:15:29,026 --> 00:15:30,494
WHEN I THINK OF THE NUMBER

516
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:31,495
OF THINGS THAT BILL HAS PULLED

517
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:33,096
OUT OF HIS PANTS OVER THE YEARS.

518
00:15:33,096 --> 00:15:33,997

519
00:15:33,997 --> 00:15:36,500
RAKE AND I'M GOING TO,

520
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,534
BUT I GUESS THIS WASN'T

521
00:15:37,534 --> 00:15:38,735
FAST ENOUGH FOR BILL,

522
00:15:38,735 --> 00:15:40,938

536
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:02,226

538
00:16:03,827 --> 00:16:07,231

00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:09,266
>>RED: BOY THAT STUMP IS,

540
00:16:09,266 --> 00:16:11,068

542
00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:12,936

00:16:12,936 --> 00:16:14,905
ALL AROUND THE LODGE,

544

SO GRAB A BIT OF THAT AND

545
00:16:16,106 --> 00:16:18,041

546
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,943
YEAH, YEAH, LOOKING GOOD,

547
00:16:19,943 --> 00:16:23,547
I PUT MY LOAD DOWN,

551
00:16:26,383 --> 00:16:27,217
OH SORRY BILL, OH, OH, OH.

552
00:16:27,217 --> 00:16:28,318
>>BILL: OH.

553
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:29,319
>>RED: WELL ANYWAY THAT'S

554
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:30,620
ALL RIGHT, HE'S ALL RIGHT,

555
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,888
WE GOT ALL THE STUFF TOGETHER

556
00:16:31,888 --> 00:16:32,823
AND WE, YOU KNOW THE INDIAN

557
00:16:32,823 --> 00:16:34,057
STYLE OF BUILDING LIKE A

558
00:16:34,057 --> 00:16:35,993
LITTLE TEEPEE TYPE OF A FIRE,

559
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:36,960
HE'S JUST GOING TO USE THE

560
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,761
SAME TYPE OF TECHNIQUE

561
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:38,862
ONLY A LOT BIGGER.

562
00:16:38,862 --> 00:16:40,163
YUP THE BIGGER BUT THE SAME,

563
00:16:40,163 --> 00:16:41,398
ABSOLUTELY THE SAME,

564
00:16:41,398 --> 00:16:42,432
I THINK THIS IS QUITE

565
00:16:42,432 --> 00:16:44,534
THE CLEVER STUFF BUT IF

566
00:16:44,534 --> 00:16:46,069
THE DESIGN WORKS MINIATURE

567
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:48,138
IT SHOULD WORK BIGGER

568
00:16:48,138 --> 00:16:49,373
THAN YOU KNOW LIKE AND

569
00:16:49,373 --> 00:16:50,574
THEN OF COURSE PUT THE JUICE

570
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:51,541
TO HER THERE, THAT'S THE OLD

571
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:52,909
BARBEQUE STARTER AND WELL

572
00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:53,810
HE'S ADDING, I'VE NEVER SEEN

573
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,812
THAT BEFORE, LOOK OUT BILL!

574
00:16:55,812 --> 00:16:59,082
>>BILL: OH!

575
00:16:59,082 --> 00:17:00,016
>>RED: BOY THAT'S JUST

576
00:17:00,016 --> 00:17:00,784
THE SAME DESIGN AS THAT BARBEQUE

577
00:17:00,784 --> 00:17:02,486
WAS WASN'T IT?

578
00:17:02,486 --> 00:17:03,754
THAT'S KIND OF A NICE LOOK

579
00:17:03,754 --> 00:17:04,988
FOR YOU BILL BUT,

580
00:17:04,988 --> 00:17:07,524
THERE WE GO, NOW HE'S ALL RIGHT,

581
00:17:07,524 --> 00:17:08,892
NOW BILL HAS JUST,

582
00:17:08,892 --> 00:17:10,227
WHENEVER HE HAS A SETBACK

583
00:17:10,227 --> 00:17:11,495
HE JUST COMPLETELY IGNORES IT

584
00:17:11,495 --> 00:17:12,429
AND HE JUST STARTS GOING

585
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:14,097
RIGHT AT HER AGAIN.

586
00:17:14,097 --> 00:17:15,098
SO I THOUGHT I JUST WOULD STAND

587
00:17:15,098 --> 00:17:16,500
BACK AND LET THE INVENTOR KIND

588
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,401
OF TAKE CARE OF THE WHOLE THING,

589
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:21,404
AND HE BUILT A CAMPFIRE THERE

590
00:17:21,404 --> 00:17:23,206
THAT WAS UP I'D SAY 12, 13,

591
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:27,777
15, 6, ABOUT 8, 12,

592
00:17:27,777 --> 00:17:28,879
IT WAS A TALL ONE...

593
00:17:28,879 --> 00:17:31,748
AND THEN HE PUT ON THE BARBEQUE

594
00:17:31,748 --> 00:17:32,816
AND HE HAD REALLY SOAKED THAT

595
00:17:32,816 --> 00:17:34,417
IN THERE AND I THOUGHT YOU

596
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:35,185
KNOW BILL YOU MIGHT OF PUT

597
00:17:35,185 --> 00:17:36,019
A LITTLE TOO MUCH, BUT ANYWAY

598
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:36,920
HE'S GOING IN THERE AND WE'RE

599
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,490
GOING TO HAVE A FIRE HERE

600
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,224
AND I HOPE WE'RE GOING TO GET

601
00:17:41,224 --> 00:17:41,992
LUNCH OR SOMETHING.

602
00:17:41,992 --> 00:17:42,792
BILL THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS

603
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:44,394
IF THIS YOU KNOW REALLY THIS

604
00:17:44,394 --> 00:17:46,096
FIRE REALLY TAKES OFF,

605
00:17:46,096 --> 00:17:47,264
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT

606
00:17:47,264 --> 00:17:51,101

607
00:17:51,101 --> 00:17:56,506

630
00:18:31,241 --> 00:18:32,008
GIRLS HIS OWN LEVEL

631
00:18:32,008 --> 00:18:33,443

SHE'LL THINK IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE

644
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,362
BASICALLY, 7- AND THEN THAT WAY

645

SHE WON'T HANG UP ON YOU

646
00:18:53,329 --> 00:18:56,232

647
00:18:56,232 --> 00:18:57,467

00:19:35,805 --> 00:19:37,974

682

>>RED: IT IS WINTER,

683
00:19:57,794 --> 00:19:59,362
HE STANDS BY THE CHIMNEY,

684
00:19:59,362 --> 00:20:01,898
HIS CHEEKS AND NOSE ARE ROSY RED

685

HIS WHISKERS ARE EDGED IN WHITE

686
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:07,270
SMOKE CURLS FROM HIS MOUTH,

687
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,171
HIS SUIT IS TINGED

688
00:20:08,171 --> 00:20:08,838
WITH BLACK SOOT,

689
00:20:08,838 --> 00:20:09,639
I WARNED HIM TO CONNECT

690
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:10,573
THE GROUND WIRE BEFORE HE

691
00:20:10,573 --> 00:20:14,243
PLUGGED IN THE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS.

692
00:20:15,144 --> 00:20:15,878

SOME DAYS IT'S HIGH,

708
00:20:38,835 --> 00:20:44,841
SOME DAYS IT'S MEDIUM/HIGH.

709
00:20:44,841 --> 00:20:45,575

714
00:20:55,952 --> 00:20:56,619
>>GORD: IN FACT IT'S ALMOST

715
00:20:56,619 --> 00:20:57,353
TIME TO TAKE A READING IF

>>GORD: 4 O'CLOCK,

721
00:21:02,358 --> 00:21:05,328
NO, NOT TIME YET.

722
00:21:05,328 --> 00:21:06,696
>>RED: WELL ALL RIGHT,

723

YOU KNOW GORD WE'VE BEEN

724
00:21:07,663 --> 00:21:08,531
HAVING A COUPLE OF FIRES UP

725
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:09,899
AT THE LODGE LATELY

726
00:21:09,899 --> 00:21:10,633
AND WE KNOW HOW DANGEROUS

727
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:11,901
FIRE CAN BE.

728
00:21:11,901 --> 00:21:13,102
>>GORD: OH YEAH, YEAH.

729
00:21:13,102 --> 00:21:14,170
AND YOUR WORST HAZARD

730
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,404
IS LIGHTNING.

731
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:16,138
>>RED: LIGHTNING?

732
00:21:16,138 --> 00:21:16,839
>>GORD: LUCKILY THOUGH

733
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:18,040
MY ROOF IS MADE OF METAL SO

734
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,242
THE LIGHTNING WILL STRIKE

735
00:21:19,242 --> 00:21:20,176
MY TOWER BEFORE IT

736
00:21:20,176 --> 00:21:21,344
STRIKES THE TREES.

737
00:21:21,344 --> 00:21:25,147
>>RED: OH.

738
00:21:25,147 --> 00:21:26,282

BUT NOW YOU KNOW I FIGURE

>>GORD: 17.

745
00:21:37,193 --> 00:21:38,160
AND THE LIGHTNING STAYS IN

746
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,428
YOUR BODY BUT THAT'S OKAY

747
00:21:39,428 --> 00:21:40,796
YOU KNOW BECAUSE AT NIGHT

748
00:21:40,796 --> 00:21:41,564
IF YOU DON'T WEAR PAJAMAS

749
00:21:41,564 --> 00:21:44,367
YOU'VE GOT A NIGHTLIGHT.

750
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:45,101

DARK THEN GORD.

753
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,205
>>GORD: YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

754
00:21:52,908 --> 00:21:54,210
>>RED: WELL YOU KNOW IT'S
