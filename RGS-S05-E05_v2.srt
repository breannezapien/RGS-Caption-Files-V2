1
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:05,972
(Car crashing)

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:08,008
(Siren)

3
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:10,844
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

4
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:13,213
HERE HE IS, THE ANSWER

5
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:14,114
TO CANADA'S QUESTION,

6
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:14,948
"HOW TOUGH CAN IT BE

7
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:16,316
TO GET A SHOW ON TELEVISION?",

8
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:19,819
YOUR HERO, MY UNCLE, RED GREEN!

9
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:21,488
(Applause and cheering)

10
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:23,790
(Whistling)

11
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,258
THERE'S HAROLD.

12
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:26,826
HOW ARE YOU, HAROLD?

13
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:28,928
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

14
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:29,796
WELL, THE BIG DAY

15
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,331
HAS FINALLY ARRIVED.

16
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,333
POSSUM LAKE'S ONLY BONA FIDE

17
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,402
MEDICAL MAN RETIRED TODAY.

18
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:38,104
WE STILL GOT DR. HARRIS.

19
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:40,340
HAROLD, DR. HARRIS IS A WOMAN.

20
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:41,808
DON'T TELL ME YOU GUYS

21
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,177
ARE THAT OLD-FASHIONED
AND INSECURE.

22
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:45,645
YES, WE ARE, HAROLD.

23
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,014
WHY DON'T YOU SEE DR. HARRIS?

24
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,016
I'VE GOT
NOTHING TO HIDE.

25
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:53,053
SO I HEARD.

26
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:58,024
(Horns honking)

27
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:01,294
(Quacking)

28
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,736
(Red): TODAY, GARTH HARBLE

29
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:12,405
HAS A DEER INSIDE HIS HOUSE.

30
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:15,608
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE
A BRAND-NEW GOLF CART

31
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:17,444
WITHOUT SPENDING 10 BUCKS,

32
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,081
AND BUZZ SHERWOOD HAS SOMETHING
TO PROTECT YOUR MELON.

33
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:30,523
I'M INVITING ANY DOCTOR
WATCHING THE SHOW

34
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,959
TO COME ON UP TO POSSUM LAKE.

35
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,563
THE ONLY DOCTORS WATCHING
THIS SHOW ARE PSYCHIATRISTS.

36
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:39,732
SAYS MR. CASE STUDY.

37
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,168
WANT YOU TO KNOW

38
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,703
THAT YOU'LL BE REPLACING

39
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,106
OUR RESIDENT MEDICAL MAN,
DR. FINGER.

40
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,575
DR. FINGER'S THE ONE THAT LEFT?

41
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,143
HE'S A VETERINARIAN.

42
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,011
CURED OUR CAT OF WORMS.

43
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:53,480
WELL, SO WHAT, HAROLD?

44
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:56,449
PEOPLE TREAT PETS
LIKE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY.

45
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,119
DR. FINGER TREATED THE FAMILY
LIKE PETS.

46
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:03,123
HE'S ONLY QUALIFIED TO TREAT
HAIRBALLS, FLEAS, AND MANGE.

47
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,325
CALL THEM BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES:

48
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:09,195
STINKY PETERSON, MOOSE
THOMPSON, AND OLD MAN SEDGWICK.

49
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:13,266
BILL'S RESPONSE
TO LOSING OUR DOCTOR

50
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,901
WAS TO TAKE THIS WEEK

51
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:19,205
AND SHOW YOU HOW TO BARBECUE
TO EAT MORE HEALTHY FOODS.

52
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,308
SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

53
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,178
I COULD TELL BILL
THAT HE'S DOING THINGS WRONG

54
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:28,148
AND THAT HE HASN'T NOTICED
THE BARBECUE HAS LEFT,

55
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:29,649
BUT THERE'S NO POINT.

56
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,718
I'LL LET BILL SEE IT THROUGH.

57
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:34,287
I'M SURE HE'LL COME
TO THE CONCLUSION

58
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:38,158
THAT HE IS DOING SOMETHING
THAT IS NOT TOTALLY CORRECT.

59
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,660
MAYBE AN EYE DOCTOR
WOULD BE IN ORDER.

60
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,162
UH-OH!

61
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:44,097
OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

62
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,600
AND THEN MAYBE
SOME BEHAVIOUR THERAPY.

63
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:52,672
DON'T WORRY -- WE'LL BE BACK
TO FINISH 'ER OFF.

64
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,607
RANGER GORD,
HAROLD HAS ARRANGED IT

65
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,109
SO THAT WE CAN PLAY

66
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,112
THE POSSUM LODGE
WORD-GUESSING GAME RIGHT HERE.

67
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,446
YES!

68
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,482
I'VE PLAYED THIS GAME BEFORE.

69
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:05,451
I NEVER RECEIVED
THE GIFTS I WON LAST TIME.

70
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:09,122
THEN YOU WON'T NEED TODAY'S
PRIZE -- A SHELVING UNIT.

71
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,623
OK, YEAH.

72
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,125
I'LL GET THE WORD.

73
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,626
DON'T PEEK, NOW.

74
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,128
I GOTTA SHOW THE PEOPLE.

75
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,629
OK.

76
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:20,133
I'VE GOT 30 SECONDS
TO GET YOU TO SAY THAT WORD.

77
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,634
READY?

78
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,136
PREPARED.

79
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,138
I HAVEN'T STARTED YET.

80
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,140
UM... ISOLATED.

81
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,641
HERO.

82
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,643
NO... DEPRESSED.

83
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,145
MARTYR.

84
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,646
ALONE.

85
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,149
UM... 16 YEARS.

86
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,650
FOREST RANGER.

87
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,652
OH, GROOVY.

88
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,089
NO, NO, NO, THE SAD PART.

89
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,591
LIGHTNING... OH, YEAH.

90
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:47,594
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

91
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,095
UM... YOU.

92
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,597
OH!

93
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,098
UH, HANDSOME.

94
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,600
NO.

95
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,101
UH, TRUSTWORTHY.

96
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,603
UH, LOYAL.

97
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,104
UH... UH... VIRGIN!

98
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,106
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

99
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,608
NOTHING.

100
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,109
I GIVE UP, I FORGET.

101
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,611
HEY, WHAT'S THAT?

102
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:06,280
WHAT'S THIS HERE?

103
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,347
(Strums acoustic guitar)

104
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,816
OHHH, FINGERS ARE HANDY,
YOU MUST UNDERSTAND

105
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:12,185
YOU CAN DO MORE THINGS
WITH YOUR FINGERS

106
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,053
THAN YOU CAN COUNT
ON ONE HAND

107
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,989
WORK WITH THEM,
POINT WITH THEM

108
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:17,490
PICK WITH THEM, SCRATCH

109
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,626
BUT IF YOU GIVE A BIG GUY
THE FINGER

110
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:23,062
YOU MAY NOT GET IT BACK

111
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,765
WITH DR. FINGER
FINALLY WASHING HIS HANDS --

112
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,267
OF HIS MEDICAL CAREER --

113
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,369
I'M GETTING HIM
A RETIREMENT GIFT.

114
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,803
I'M THINKING GOLF CART.

115
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,406
I COULD BUY ONE OF THEM
FANCY RIDING ONES,

116
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:36,576
BUT I'D HAVE TO FORGET
WHAT I THOUGHT OF DR. FINGER

117
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,245
OR I'D HAVE TO BE RICH
OR AN IDIOT OR BOTH.

118
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:42,315
INSTEAD, I'LL BUILD
ONE OF THOSE GOLF CARTS

119
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:43,816
THAT YOU PULL ALONG.

120
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:47,754
I NEED SOME PLASTIC PIPING
AND VARIOUS ODDS AND ENDS,

121
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,089
AND A KID'S BIKE,
LIKE THIS ONE.

122
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,325
FIRST, I GOTTA
GET THE WHEELS OFF.

123
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,994
TO DO THAT, I'LL RUN 'ER
AS FAST AS I CAN

124
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,562
INTO THAT BRICK WALL.

125
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,101
DONE.

126
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,337
MAYBE I SHOULD CUT BACK
ON DESSERTS.

127
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,906
YOU'RE GONNA PUT THESE
ON YOUR GOLF CART.

128
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,475
NORMAL GOLF CARTS HAVE
LITTLE WEE WHEELS,

129
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,844
BUT THEY'RE ONLY GOOD
FOR THE FAIRWAY.

130
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,780
HOW MANY OF US ARE EVER THERE?

131
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,115
NEXT, GET YOURSELF
A CAN OF SOUP.

132
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:17,617
OH!

133
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,053
MAKE THAT AN EMPTY CAN OF SOUP.

134
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,488
ATTACH THAT
TO ONE OF THE WHEELS

135
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,290
AND JUST USE ONE BOLT.

136
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,660
USE ONE BOLT
SO THE CAN STAYS LEVEL

137
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,429
AS THE WHEEL GOES AROUND.

138
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,665
YOU PUT WATER IN THERE
AND DROP YOUR BALL IN...

139
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,001
YOU HAVE A CONTINUOUS
BALL WASHER.

140
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,803
SOUNDS LIKE HEAVEN TO ME.

141
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,672
TAKE YOUR PIECES
OF PLASTIC PIPE, HERE,

142
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:43,576
AND YOU WANT TO CUT THESE
INTO ABOUT 30-INCH LENGTHS.

143
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,978
YOU CAN MEASURE, IF YOU LIKE.

144
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:48,081
I PREFER TO JUST EYEBALL.

145
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,415
WE GOT PLENTY THERE.

146
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:50,750
YOU COULD CUT THAT

147
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:53,553
WITH A FINE-TOOTH HACKSAW
OR A CARPET KNIFE.

148
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:57,156
LIKE I SAY, I NEVER
REALLY LIKED DR. FINGER.

149
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,427
YOU ATTACH ALL THOSE TOGETHER,

150
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,597
USING THE HANDYMAN'S
SECRET WEAPON, DUCT TAPE.

151
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,400
ALL RIGHT, REACH WAY DOWN
INTO YOUR BED

152
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,102
AND YOU COME UP WITH...

153
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:10,503
A HOT WATER BOTTLE.

154
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,606
IF YOU COME UP WITH SOMETHING
ELSE, CHANGE THE SHEETS.

155
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:16,175
YOU CUT THIS ALL THE WAY AROUND

156
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:19,612
AND STRETCH 'ER
OVER THE END OF THE TUBES.

157
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:23,583
BE CAREFUL -- WORKING WITH
RUBBER CAN BE TRICKY.

158
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:27,520
I HAVEN'T BEEN SLAPPED
THAT MANY TIMES SINCE THE PROM.

159
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,122
HERE'S HOW SHE WORKS.

160
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:32,325
GET A CLUB AND STICK THEM DOWN
INTO THESE TUBES

161
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,659
SO THE HANDLE RESTS

162
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,629
AGAINST THE RUBBER
OF THE HOT WATER BOTTLE.

163
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:41,134
WHEN YOU WANT A CLUB,
PUSH DOWN FIRMLY...

164
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,569
AND SHE POPS UP
INTO YOUR HANDS.

165
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,972
GET YOURSELF THE REST
OF THE PIPES

166
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,540
AND YOUR FISHING REEL

167
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,643
AND YOU'RE READY TO PUT
THE UNIT TOGETHER.

168
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,980
WE GOT OUR CLUBS IN THERE.

169
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,481
WE GOT OUR BALL WASHER.

170
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,583
I WANT TO SHOW YOU
ANOTHER FEATURE.

171
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,453
GET YOURSELF
A HEAVY-DUTY FISHING REEL,

172
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,023
MOUNT THAT ON THERE,
AND ON THE END OF THE LINE,

173
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,027
ATTACH A RUBBER HOSE WASHER
OUT OF YOUR HOSE.

174
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,696
WHEN YOU PULL THE CLUB OUT,
FIRST OF ALL,

175
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,065
FLIP THIS HOSE WASHER
OVER THE GRIP.

176
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,467
THAT WAY, IF THE SHOT

177
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:17,270
DOESN'T GO EXACTLY
THE WAY YOU WANTED IT TO

178
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,906
AND YOU'RE SLIPPING
INTO A BLINDING RAGE

179
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,608
AND TRYING TO THROW THE CLUB
TO THE MOON,

180
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,076
AFTER YOU COOL OFF,

181
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:27,480
ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS REEL
THE CLUB BACK IN...

182
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,615
UNLESS YOU NAILED SOMEBODY,

183
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:34,120
IN WHICH CASE, I WOULD SAY,
CUT THE LINE AND KEEP WALKING.

184
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,922
ANOTHER FEATURE I'VE GOT IS

185
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:38,458
I'VE ATTACHED A BOW SAW
TO THE HANDLE,

186
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:40,960
FOR WHEN YOUR BALL
GOES BEHIND A TREE.

187
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,595
YOU STAND BEHIND THE TREE

188
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,764
AND ROCK YOUR CART
BACK AND FORTH

189
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:48,501
WHILE YOU'RE MAKING YOUR CLUB
SELECTION, AND YOU'LL FIND

190
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:51,571
THE PROBLEM WILL PROBABLY
TAKE CARE OF ITSELF.

191
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,840
ANOTHER THING I GOT --
REALLY GREAT --

192
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:56,609
THE HANDLE IS ANOTHER PIECE
OF PLASTIC PIPING.

193
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,945
GOES DOWN INTO AN ELBOW
AND OUT A PIPE.

194
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:02,014
WHEN YOU'VE LOST YOUR BALL
OR PUT IT INTO THE WOODS

195
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,616
OR IT'S ON ANOTHER FAIRWAY

196
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,585
AND YOU WANT
TO KEEP THAT SECRET,

197
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:09,255
YOU KINDA GET CLOSE
AND DROP A BALL DOWN HERE

198
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,756
AND... OH!

199
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,391
THERE'S MY BALL THERE.

200
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,360
THERE'S YOUR SET OF GOLF CLUBS.

201
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,330
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

202
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,599
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

203
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,667
I THINK I'LL USE A FOUR IRON.

204
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:25,605
WONDER WHY THEY CALL IT
A FOUR IRON.

205
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,106
FORE!

206
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,541
(Glass
breaking)

207
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,444
NEXT, BUZZ SHERWOOD,
WHO'S ALWAYS IN THE CLOUDS,

208
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,179
BUT USUALLY WITH HIS PLANE.

209
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,719
GETTING A DOCTOR HERE
IS HARDER THAN WE THOUGHT.

210
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,220
THEY SAY THERE'S NO DEMAND.

211
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,755
WE'RE TOO HEALTHY.

212
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:47,126
PEOPLE PRETEND THEY'RE HEALTHY
TO AVOID SEEING DR. FINGER.

213
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,730
HE KEEPS YOU OVERNIGHT
IN A CAGE ON SOME NEWSPAPER.

214
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,231
WE'RE NOT HEALTHY HERE.

215
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:56,102
THERE'S ENOUGH SICKOS HERE TO
KEEP A M.A.S.H. UNIT HUMMING.

216
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,504
FLINTY McCLINTOCK HAS
THAT EYE THING.

217
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:02,308
STINKY PETERSON -- YOU GOTTA
HAVE SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU

218
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,243
TO HAVE A NICKNAME
LIKE "STINKY".

219
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,379
WHAT ABOUT GIMPY O'HARA?

220
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:07,680
TYPHOID LARRY.

221
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,649
BLOTCHY WILLIAMS
AND HIS BLOTCHES.

222
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,684
LUMPY MITCHELL AND HIS LUMPS.

223
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,286
SCABBY JOHNSON AND HIS JOHNSON.

224
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,757
HI, THIS IS RANGER GORD,

225
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:21,260
STANDING ON GUARD FOR YOU
23 HOURS A DAY.

226
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,262
(Gunfire)

227
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,765
THE OTHER HOUR'S MY TIME!

228
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,833
MY TIME!

229
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:35,274
NO ONE IN YOUR FAMILY
HAS THE NERVE TO TELL YOU,

230
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,709
SO I WILL.

231
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,844
I'VE SEEN YOU DRIVING
THROUGH TOWN,

232
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,614
TURNING WITHOUT SIGNALLING,
DRIVING TOO SLOW,

233
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,950
TURNING RIGHT
FROM THE LEFT-HAND LANE,

234
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,786
PARKING WITH YOUR CAR
HALF UP ON THE SIDEWALK.

235
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,888
OK, HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.

236
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,791
YOU'RE STARTING TO DRIVE
LIKE YOUR DAD.

237
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,292
(Audience laughing)

238
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:56,862
THERE'S NOTHING SCARIER
THAN A LITTLE MAN IN A BIG CAR

239
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,800
PEEKING UP OVER THE DASHBOARD
WITH A SOUR LOOK ON HIS FACE.

240
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:04,904
SOME PEOPLE SAY
THAT LOSING YOUR DRIVING SKILLS

241
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,807
IS JUST PART OF NATURE'S WAY
OF THINNING THE HERD.

242
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:09,308
(Laughing)

243
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,177
BUT I SAY, "GIVE IT UP,"

244
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:14,046
AND I SAY THAT,
KNOWING THAT YOU WON'T,

245
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,482
'CAUSE THE GUYS
I'M REFERRING TO

246
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,318
THINK I'M REFERRING
TO SOMEBODY ELSE.

247
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,621
HERE'S A SOLUTION
YOU CAN LIVE WITH.

248
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,690
AT OUR AGE, WE ONLY GO
TO FIVE DIFFERENT PLACES.

249
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:27,426
YOUR WORK, YOUR LODGE,
YOUR GROCERY STORE,

250
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,762
YOUR GAS STATION,
MAYBE YOUR CHURCH.

251
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,831
JUST MEMORIZE
THOSE FIVE ROUTES.

252
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:35,301
YOU'LL GO DOWN SO FAR,
YOU'LL PUT THE TURN SIGNAL ON,

253
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,603
YOU'LL TURN HERE,
YOU'LL STOP HERE.

254
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,538
DO EVERYTHING JUST BY MEMORY.

255
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,774
TRY TO KEEP UP
TO THE SPEED LIMIT.

256
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,409
THEY HAVE IT ON BIG SIGNS.

257
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,344
YOU GET THOSE FIVE ROUTES DOWN

258
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:48,748
AND DON'T GO ANYWHERE ELSE
EVER THE REST OF YOUR LIFE,

259
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,483
YOU'LL STOP BEING A MENACE.

260
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,685
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

261
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,720
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

262
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:58,791
PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY SAFETY IS
NUMBER ONE AND HERE'S A FELLA

263
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,293
WHO'S PROBABLY COUNTING
BACKWARDS -- BUZZ SHERWOOD.

264
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,297
IT'S GOTTA BE SAFETY FIRST,
NO MATTER WHAT YOU'RE RUNNING

265
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:08,300
'CAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW
WHEN YOU'LL TOTAL IT.

266
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:11,137
I ALWAYS RECOMMEND
GET A GOOD HELMET.

267
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,305
THAT IS A VERY UNIQUE UNIT.

268
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,807
I MADE IT MYSELF.

269
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,308
KIND OF A PAPER.

270
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,011
IT'S LIKE PAPIER MACHE
THAT KIDS DO,

271
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,880
AND IT FITS AND IT WORKS.

272
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,749
HERE, LOOK -- SAY THIS MELON
IS MY HEAD.

273
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,251
OH, YEAH, SURE.

274
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,253
EXCEPT THIS IS GREEN
WITH NO HAIR ON IT.

275
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:28,754
YEAH, YEAH.

276
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:32,324
IT'S FULL OF JUICE AND SEEDS
AND I DON'T HAVE THE SEEDS.

277
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,060
YOU KNOW WHEN THESE GO RIPE

278
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,495
AND YOU GET THOSE FLIES
BUZZING AROUND

279
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:39,098
AND THEY DIE ON THE SOAP
IN THE BATHROOM?

280
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,433
YEAH.

281
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:41,867
I GET THOSE.

282
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,937
SO SAY THIS IS MY HEAD AND
SAY I'M OUT ON MY DUNE BUGGY.

283
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,272
I SEE, YEAH.

284
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,140
I'M GOING ACROSS THE COUNTRY

285
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,276
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I WIPE OUT!

286
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:51,777
AHHHH! LOOK OUT!

287
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:55,281
OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH!

288
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:56,615
MY GOSH.

289
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:57,950
QUITE A BEATING, HUH?

290
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,286
WATCH THIS -- LOOK AT THAT.

291
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,787
FOR GOSH SAKES!

292
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,289
THIS MELON IS OK.

293
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:04,623
OH!

294
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,958
ISN'T THAT GREAT?

295
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,293
YOU WANT TO TRY IT?

296
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,796
UH, NO, BUT
I THINK HAROLD WOULD.

297
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,832
OH, COOL -- HAROLD, COME HERE.

298
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,534
PARTICIPATE, HAROLD --
THAT'S THE THING.

299
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,937
IF YOU'RE LOOSE,
YOU DON'T GET HURT.

300
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,306
SOMETIMES I'M SO LOOSE
I COULD DIE.

301
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:21,807
(Laughing)

302
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,309
OK, HERE WE GO.

303
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,245
HERE COMES THE SHERWOOD
PAPIER MACHE HELMET.

304
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,747
BRACE YOURSELF.

305
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,248
OH! OH!

306
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:30,750
(Moaning)

307
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:32,251
HAROLD, YOU OK?

308
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,353
I THINK HE'S PEOPLE MACHE.

309
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,055
I GOTTA PUT MORE GLUE

310
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:39,391
AND NEWSPAPER ON THAT SIDE,
RIGHT, HAROLD?

311
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,893
HERE'S A HANDYMAN HINT.

312
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,928
YOU HAVE DIFFERENT SCREW HEADS.

313
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,563
YOU'VE GOT THE SLOT HEAD.

314
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,066
THE STAR-SHAPED
OR PHILLIPS SCREW HEAD.

315
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,734
YOU HAVE THE SQUARE HOLE,

316
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:52,171
OR AS WE CALL IT IN CANADA,
THE ROBERTSON SCREW HEAD.

317
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:55,274
EVEN HAVE MACHINE SCREWS
THAT TAKE AN ALLEN KEY.

318
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,343
FOR ALL THESE SCREW HEADS,
I RECOMMEND THE FLAT HEAD.

319
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:02,181
REMEMBER, ANY TOOL
CAN BE THE RIGHT TOOL.

320
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,756
THE MEDICAL CRISIS IS OVER.

321
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,159
WE GOT OURSELVES A DOCTOR.

322
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,194
AW, GREAT -- WHO DID YOU GET?

323
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,163
THE GUY WHO ANSWERED THE AD.

324
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,664
CHECK OUT THE RESUME.

325
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,566
GOT HIM FROM PORT ASBESTOS.

326
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,568
ARE WE STEALING
THEIR DOCTOR?

327
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,738
NO, HE WASN'T PRACTISING
MEDICINE IN PORT ASBESTOS.

328
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,373
HE WAS A BARTENDER.

329
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,241
HE'S GOT A MEDICAL DEGREE.

330
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,344
SIGNED BY
SALLY STRUTHERS.

331
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,147
YEAH, SO?

332
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:38,250
HE WAS EIGHT YEARS
AT A TROPICAL RESORT.

333
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,220
HA! CLUB TANABANANA.

334
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:45,057
I'M SURE THOSE RESORT DOCTORS
TREAT A VARIETY OF ILLNESSES.

335
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,159
WELL, HE WAS THE LIFEGUARD.

336
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,928
LOOK, HE'S GOT OTHER DEGREES.

337
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,096
V.C.R. REPAIR,
FURNACE RENOVATIONS...

338
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,265
WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO
WITH ANYTHING?

339
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,835
HE PROBABLY MAKES HOUSE CALLS.

340
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,138
(Buzz): HAROLD!

341
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,806
HAROLD, YOU OK?

342
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:02,274
HAROLD, WHOA!

343
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,477
I HAD NO IDEA IT WOULD DO THAT
AFTER I LIT IT.

344
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:07,546
MAN, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT.

345
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,849
IT ROCKETED
RIGHT OVER YOUR HEAD.

346
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:13,285
YOU DIDN'T SEE IT,
BUT MAN, IT WENT... IT WENT...

347
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,021
IT WENT TO THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE LAKE.

348
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,590
BUT YOU'RE OK, RIGHT?

349
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,458
COME ON, MAN, TALK TO ME.

350
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,294
HOW DO YOU MAKE YOUR EYES
GO LIKE THAT?

351
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,896
HAROLD?

352
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,065
(Red): ALL RIGHT, HERE IT IS.

353
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:29,201
GOOD OLD BILL
AND HIS BARBECUE SPECIAL.

354
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,736
GOT THE WIENIES OUT.

355
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,304
THAT'S THEM FOR SURE.

356
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,573
HE'S GONNA DO SOME BARBECUING.

357
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,209
BILL HASN'T DONE BARBECUING
FOR A WHILE.

358
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,944
HE PUTS THE BRIQUETTES IN

359
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,512
AND HE PUTS THE STARTER ON

360
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,282
AND YOU CAN TELL
WHEN A FELLA HASN'T BARBECUED

361
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:47,219
FOR A WHILE, AND HE HAS
HIS OWN SPECIAL-- WHAT IS THAT?

362
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,688
10W30, IN CASE WE HAVE
A COLD SNAP.

363
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:51,257
THROWS THAT ON THERE.

364
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:54,693
HE'S EVEN GOT
THE PARAFFIN SOAP... NITRO...

365
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,664
THE REASON I KNEW
HE HADN'T BARBECUED FOR A WHILE

366
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,467
IS THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY
A PROPANE BARBECUE.

367
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,702
TURN THE GAS ON
AND THEN THERE'S...

368
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,204
THERE'S SOME CONTROLS.

369
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,239
YOU GOT TWO BURNERS --
YOU CAN CONTROL

370
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,208
EITHER BURNER, ANYWAY,

371
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,609
SO BILL, HE'S MORE OF

372
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:13,545
A DOER THAN A THINKER --
BOY, THAT PROPANE'S

373
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,614
GOT A-- WHAT?

374
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:17,116
UH-OH... UH...

375
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:20,052
NO, TURN IT OFF AT THE TANK.

376
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,787
JUST TURN THAT, TURN THAT...

377
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,322
OH!

378
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,724
UM...

379
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,326
ALL RIGHT, UH...

380
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,695
NO, NO, BILL -- SPARKS!

381
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,230
AHHHHH!

382
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,731
(Red): OH.

383
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:34,733
OHHH...

384
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,669
(Red): LATER THAT DAY,

385
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:40,739
BILL AND I ARE WONDERING
WHERE THE BARBECUE IS.

386
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:42,741
OH, THERE'S THE TABLE.

387
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,243
AND, UH...

388
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,247
THERE'S WIENIES
AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE.

389
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,748
OOH! AHHH...

390
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,750
STUFF'S DROPPING
OUT OF THE SKY.

391
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:54,920
WHAT IS THAT STRANGE
BIRD-LIKE THING DROPPING?

392
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,755
OH, IT'S THE BARBECUE LID.

393
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,090
WOW.

394
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,392
ALL RIGHT,
WE GOT EVERYTHING BACK.

395
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,894
OH, BOY.

396
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,395
WELL, THAT'S RARE.

397
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,265
IT'S CERTAINLY
NOT WELL-DONE, ANYWAY.

398
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,500
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

399
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:12,671
GARTH'S GONNA TAKE A DEER
OUT OF HIS HOUSE.

400
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,611
OUR NEW DOCTOR
SET UP HIS PRACTICE.

401
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:22,114
HE RENTED THE OLD
MR. TASTY-FREEZE STAND.

402
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,850
YOU KNOW THE BIG
MR. TASTY-FREEZE?

403
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,553
THAT FAT MAN HOLDING
THE BUTTERSCOTCH SUNDAE.

404
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,855
THAT SUNDAE IS NOW A BEDPAN.

405
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:33,459
HE COULDN'T AFFORD A NEW SIGN
SO FROM NOW ON,

406
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,028
WE'LL CALL HIM
DR. TASTY-FREEZE.

407
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,131
DR. TASTY-FREEZE COULDN'T
AFFORD MEDICAL EQUIPMENT.

408
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,633
HE SOLD IT TO PAY
FOR BARTENDING COLLEGE.

409
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,337
HE HAS TO USE THE EQUIPMENT
AT THE TASTY-FREEZE.

410
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,072
ONE GUY HAD A BROKEN ARM

411
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,675
AND CAME OUT
WITH A BANANA SPLINT.

412
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,010
I DON'T KNOW,
HAROLD.

413
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,645
MOOSE THOMPSON SAYS
DR. TASTY-FREEZE IS GREAT.

414
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:56,849
HE'S JUST FAKING IT
FOR THE ICE CREAM.

415
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,917
I'M NO DOCTOR,
BUT I DON'T THINK

416
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:02,454
A PEANUT BUSTER BROWNIE PARFAIT
IS ANY CURE FOR GOUT.

417
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,958
DO YOU WANT ANYBODY OPERATING
ON YOU WITH PLASTIC CUTLERY?

418
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,459
I LIKE THE IDEA

419
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:11,463
OF GOING TO SOMEBODY
NAMED DR. TASTY-FREEZE.

420
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,768
YOU WON'T WHEN YOU FEEL
HOW COLD HIS FINGER IS.

421
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:18,237
GARTH HARBLE HERE,
ANIMAL CONTROL,

422
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,272
SHOWING YOU HOW TO MAINTAIN

423
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,975
MAN'S DOMINANCE
OVER THE WILD BEASTS.

424
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,177
SPEAKING OF WILD BEASTS...

425
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,979
COME ON IN HERE, RED!

426
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,714
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT FOR US?

427
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,817
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING SPECIAL, RED.

428
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,153
I'M GOING TO TAKE
THIS OPPORTUNITY

429
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:37,489
TO SHOW YOU HOW TO GET A DEER
OUT OF YOUR HOUSE.

430
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,991
(Crashing and banging)

431
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,993
HOLY MACKEREL! WOW!

432
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,461
WELL, DON'T WORRY, RED.

433
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:45,731
IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO GET
A DEER OUT OF YOUR HOUSE.

434
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:49,001
IT'S A LOT EASIER THAN, SAY,
GETTING A MUSKRAT OUT.

435
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,502
OH, OH.

436
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,004
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

437
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:56,075
ALL I NEED IS A FLASHLIGHT,
A BRIGHT FLASHLIGHT.

438
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,344
SORT OF LIKE A HEADLIGHT.

439
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,747
SURE, THE WAY A DEER--
WHOA, WHOA!

440
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:04,950
THE WAY A DEER WILL FREEZE
IN THE HEADLIGHTS.

441
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,452
EXACTLY!

442
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,021
(Crashing and banging)

443
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,459
ALL RIGHT, DEER, WHERE ARE YOU?

444
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:14,960
OH, GREAT!

445
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,463
DRINKING OUT OF MY AQUARIUM!

446
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:18,964
FREEZE!

447
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,466
GOTCHA!

448
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:21,967
HELLO, DEER!

449
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,470
I'M HOME!

450
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:25,971
ALL RIGHT.

451
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,474
(Deer panting)

452
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,476
EASY, NOW, EASY.

453
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,478
GET OUT THERE.

454
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,480
AH... WHOA!

455
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:35,981
CAREFUL, CAREFUL, CAREFUL.

456
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,316
DON'T DO THAT.

457
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:38,650
HOLY MACKEREL.

458
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:39,985
ALL RIGHT.

459
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,987
WOW, THAT'S GOOD WORK.

460
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:47,993
ALL I DO IS TAKE HIM BACK OUT
INTO THE WOODS AND, UH...

461
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,597
KEEP A STEP BACK SO I DON'T GET
KICKED BY HIS HOOVES,

462
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,999
AND THEN I TURN OFF
THE FLASHLIGHT.

463
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,502
FOR GOSH SAKES --
BOY, THAT WORKS GREAT.

464
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,003
IT SURE DOES.

465
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,006
MIGHT EVEN WORK
ON YOU, RED.

466
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,508
REALLY?

467
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,009
(Kicking)

468
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,011
OH! OW!

469
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,513
OHHH...

470
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,014
THAT WAS A SCAR!

471
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,516
OH!

472
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:12,017
EEE! OH!

473
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,519
OW! OW! OW!

474
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,020
GET UP -- RUN!

475
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,689
OH, ANOTHER
SUPER DAY!

476
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,892
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT PORTION.

477
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,061
THIS WEEK, WE HAVE TWO EXPERTS:
MY UNCLE RED

478
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:26,031
AND HIS BEST FRIEND,
MR. DALTON HUMPHREY.

479
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:29,034
(Applause and cheering)

480
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,537
(Whistling)

481
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,071
HERE'S THE LETTER HERE.

482
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,541
IT GOES AS FOLLOWS:
"DEAR EXPERTS..."

483
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,409
"WHAT IS AN APPROPRIATE

484
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:41,513
"WEDDING GIFT WHEN IT'S
THE THIRD TIME FOR THE GROOM

485
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,016
"AND THE FOURTH FOR THE BRIDE?"

486
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:49,154
WELL, HOW ABOUT ONE OF THEM
DO-IT-YOURSELF DIVORCE KITS?

487
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,789
GOT THE LITTLE SIGN

488
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,559
ON THERE --
"SOME DISASSEMBLY REQUIRED".

489
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,561
(Laughing)

490
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,829
NO, RED, WHEN
A WEDDING

491
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,933
IS THE Nth TIME AROUND,
LIKE THIS ONE IS,

492
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,901
YOU WANT TO GET SOMETHING

493
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:07,005
THAT WILL CAPTURE THE FEELINGS
OF THE BRIDE AND GROOM.

494
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,507
ALL RIGHT.

495
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:11,243
I WOULD SUGGEST SOMETHING USED.

496
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,513
(Audience laughing)

497
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,848
OR AS WE SAY
IN THE ANTIQUE BUSINESS,

498
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,251
"PREVIOUSLY ENJOYED".

499
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,619
(Audience laughing)

500
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,821
WHEN A COUPLE'S
BEEN MARRIED A LOT,

501
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,957
THEY'VE GOT
ALL THE WEDDING GIFTS.

502
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,793
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH A DOZEN TOASTERS?

503
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:31,096
I GUESS YOU COULD HEAT
YOUR HOUSE.

504
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:35,234
WHAT SETTINGS
ARE YOU GONNA PUT THEM ON?

505
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,037
WELL, IF IT'S NIGHT,
YOU SET IT FOR "DARK".

506
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:45,043
(Laughing and applause)

507
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,079
YOU KNOW...
Y-Y-YOU KNOW,

508
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,381
A COUPLE THAT'S
BEEN MARRIED BEFORE

509
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,483
MAY NOT BE SO HARD TO SHOP FOR,

510
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,852
ESPECIALLY IF
THEY'VE BEEN WIPED OUT

511
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,887
IN A PREVIOUSLY MESSY DIVORCE.

512
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,489
GREAT TO BUY FOR SOMEBODY

513
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:00,559
WHO'S HAD A TERRIBLE
PERSONAL TRAGEDY LIKE THAT.

514
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,060
YEAH!

515
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:03,862
ANYTHING --
THEY'LL TAKE ANYTHING!

516
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,497
YEAH!

517
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,132
(Red): YEAH, I LOVE THAT.

518
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,634
YEAH.

519
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,135
YEAH.

520
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,004
SAD, THOUGH -- IT'S SAD.

521
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,506
(Laughing)

522
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,508
GOD, IT'S A SHAME.

523
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,010
(Laughing)

524
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:20,612
I'VE GOT--

525
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,214
YOU GUYS ARE AWFUL.

526
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,782
YOU'RE SO CYNICAL.

527
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:28,253
YOU MAKE MARRIAGE SOUND SO
CHEAP AND COLD AND USED AND--

528
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,689
NO, NO, NO,
NOT "USED", HAROLD.

529
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:33,025
"PREVIOUSLY ENJOYED."
"PREVIOUSLY ENJOYED."

530
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:37,462
(Laughing and applause)

531
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,165
GARTH HARBLE HERE,
ANIMAL CONTROL.

532
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:43,302
YOU KNOW, CONTRARY
TO POPULAR FOLKLORE,

533
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:47,039
BATS WILL NOT SUCK THE BLOOD
OUT OF YOUR BODY.

534
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:49,207
THAT'S YOUR BOSS'S JOB.

535
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:52,077
(Laughing)

536
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,945
OUR MEDICAL CRISIS IS OVER.

537
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,381
DR. TASTY-FREEZE
WAS A HUGE SUCCESS.

538
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:58,750
WHEN HE STARTED USING
A THERMOMETER

539
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,886
WITH A MARASCHINO CHERRY
ON TOP,

540
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:03,555
EVERYBODY SAID,
"NO, I'M FEELING FINE."

541
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,090
I THINK
DR. TASTY-FREEZE

542
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,892
IS GOING BACK TO BARTENDING.

543
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,393
FOR MY HERNIA CHECK-UP,

544
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,729
HE ASKED IF I WANTED IT
WITH A TWIST.

545
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,631
WELL, DOESN'T MATTER, ANYWAY.

546
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:16,068
JUNIOR SINGLETON FOUND A DOCTOR
OVER IN PORT SANDBAR.

547
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:18,537
DR. TUNA OR DR. TWOFUN
OR SOMETHING...

548
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:19,871
DR. TUNE-UP?

549
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:21,206
DR. TUNE-UP, YEAH.

550
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,408
THAT'S NOT A DOCTOR'S OFFICE.

551
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,344
THAT'S A GARAGE FOR CARS.

552
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:29,181
ALL'S I KNOW IS HE GOT HIS
PLUGS, POINTS, AND FLUIDS DONE

553
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:31,516
FOR $19.95, AND
THEY FIXED HIS CAR.

554
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,018
(Possum squeal)

555
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,519
MEETING TIME,
UNCLE RED.

556
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:36,188
I'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.

557
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:37,622
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

558
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,725
I'M COMING HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

559
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:42,094
I'M FEELING GREAT
FOR A MAN OF MY AGE.

560
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,364
I'M CURIOUS ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL
FOR A WOMAN YOUR AGE.

561
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,966
THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

562
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,036
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND HAROLD AND THE GANG,

563
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,038
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

564
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:57,209
(Applause)

565
00:22:57,275 --> 00:23:03,982
(Possum squeal)

566
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,984
ALL RISE, ALL RISE.

567
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,019
THE PRESIDENT'S
IN THE ROOM NOW.

568
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,591
QUANDO OMNI
FLUNKUS MORITATI.
