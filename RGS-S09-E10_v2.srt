00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:05,772
HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHY A
GOLF BALL GOES SO FAR?

2
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:10,210
THEY TELL ME IT'S
ALL THE DIMPLES.

3
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:12,112
OH, YEAH, THESE LITTLE
DENTS IN THE GOLF BALL

4
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:14,180
MAKE IT AERODYNAMIC.

5
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:17,751
ACTUALLY, THERE ARE 336
DIMPLES IN A GOLF BALL.

6
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,085
I KNOW.

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,088
I COUNTED THEM ONE DAY WHEN I
WAS WITH BERNICE AT THE MALL.

8
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:25,225
SO I'M THINKIN' IF DIMPLES MAKE
THE GOLF BALL GO FARTHER,

9
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:28,428
THEY SHOULD HAVE THE SAME
EFFECT ON THIS VEHICLE.

10
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,563
THAT'S WHERE THIS BALL-PEEN
HAMMER COMES IN.

11
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,732
WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE
TECHNOLOGY OF THE GOLF BALL

12
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,368
AND APPLY IT TO THE POOR
DESIGN OF THIS FORD

13
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:36,836
336 TIMES.

14

IF HENRY FORD HAD OF
THOUGHT OF THIS,

21
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,685
HE WOULD'VE MADE A FORTUNE.

22
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,888

WE'VE GOT AN OVERSIZED DRIVER.

A LOT OF DEAD MICE IN
THEIR BEER BOTTLES.

34
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:31,157
NOW, PERSONALLY, I THINK
IT'S A CULT SUICIDE THING.

35
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:35,028
AND IF YOU EVER TASTED THE BEER,
I THINK YOU'D AGREE WITH ME.

36

NOW, THEIR SLOGAN IS,
"THE BEER THAT GOES DOWN FAST."

ACTUALLY BEEN GOIN' DOWN A
LITTLE BIT FASTER.

SO THEY'RE UPGRADING
THE WHOLE PLANT,

USE HIS AS A BARREL.

OUT THERE ARE REALLY
GONNA LOVE THIS.

159
00:06:20,245 --> 00:06:23,048
THIS -- THIS -- THESE ARE
REALLY CUTE LITTLE GUYS.

160
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:24,917
KIND OF SMALL
AND FUZZY, EH?

161
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:26,185
SOUNDS GREAT,
YEAH.

162
00:06:26,251 --> 00:06:28,053
MUST BE PRETTY SMALL IF
IT FITS IN THAT BOX.

163
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,521
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY
AIR HOLES, I SEE.

164
00:06:29,588 --> 00:06:30,856
NO, BUT DON'T
WORRY, RED.

165
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,257
THERE'S NO
TARANTULAS HERE.

166
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:34,593
THERE'S ONLY
CARPENTER ANTS.

167
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,098
OH! OH! OH!

168
00:06:40,165 --> 00:06:42,034
OKAY! OKAY!
OH! OH! OH!

169
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,136
OKAY! OH!

170
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:46,738
THIS COULD BE A BIT OF A
PROBLEM IF, UH -- IF, UH --

171
00:06:46,772 --> 00:06:49,341
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
HERE THAT'S MADE OF WOOD?

172
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:56,148
WELL, UH, A
FEW THINGS, YEAH.

173

00:06:56,548 --> 00:06:57,716
OH!

00:06:58,784 --> 00:07:00,052
OKAY. OKAY.
I'LL GET 'EM.

176
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:01,286
GET 'EM.
THERE'S ONE THERE.

177
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:01,787
OH! OH!

178
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,123
OVER THERE!

179
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:06,558
HEY, I THINK THEY'RE
HEADING FOR THE DOOR!

180
00:07:13,965 --> 00:07:16,101
OKAY, THEY'RE
OUTTA HERE.

181
00:07:18,937 --> 00:07:20,706
THANKS, ED.

182
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:22,741
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

183
00:07:24,176 --> 00:07:25,477
NEED TO HAVE
A LITTLE FUNDRAISER

184
00:07:25,544 --> 00:07:27,813
FOR THE POSSUM LAKE
HULA DANCING CLUB

185
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:30,182
TO HELP THEM GET TO
THE FINALS IN HONOLULU.

186
00:07:30,248 --> 00:07:32,684
AND I FIGURED WE'D HAVE A
CRIBBAGE TOURNAMENT.

187
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:34,886
BUT I WENT INTO TOWN --
I NEED 30 CRIBBAGE BOARDS.

188
00:07:34,953 --> 00:07:36,588
WENT TO BUY ONE.
EIGHT BUCKS!

189
00:07:36,655 --> 00:07:38,557
EIGHT BUCKS
FOR A CRIBBAGE BOARD.

190
00:07:38,623 --> 00:07:41,359
MAN, BY THE TIME WE PAY OFF
THE GAMING COMMISSION

191
00:07:41,426 --> 00:07:43,528
AND THE LIQUOR CONTROL PEOPLE
AND THE FIRE MARSHAL,

192
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:45,731
THERE WON'T BE ENOUGH MONEY LEFT
TO BUY THE GRASS SKIRTS

193
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:48,066
OR THE COCONUT SHELL
BIKINI TOPS.

194
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:51,870
SO I FIGURE I CAN MAKE THE
DARNED CRIBBAGE BOARDS
CHEAPER AND QUICKER,

195
00:07:51,903 --> 00:07:53,371
AND HERE'S THE BEST PART,

196
00:07:53,438 --> 00:07:55,307
I WON'T HAVE TO BUY
ANY SPECIAL MACHINERY

197
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,444
BECAUSE, LIKE CAPPUCCINO FOAM,
IT'S ALL UNDER MY NOSE.

198
00:07:59,744 --> 00:08:01,680
OKAY, MAYBE YOU DON'T
HAVE A TABLE SAW,

199
00:08:01,746 --> 00:08:04,749
BUT I BET YOU HAVE
A TABLE AND A SAW.

200
00:08:04,816 --> 00:08:06,952
JUST PUT 'EM
TOGETHER.

201
00:08:07,285 --> 00:08:09,688
I CAN STILL HEAR THE
SOUND OF UNCLE AL'S TRUSS

202
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:15,093
WHEN HE'D LUNGE ACROSS THIS
TABLE TO FIGHT THE KIDS FOR
THE STRING OFF THE ROAST.

203
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,661
MEMORIES.

204
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:25,403
NOW ALL I NEED IS A SHAPER,

205
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,606
OR AS I CALL IT,
A BLENDER.

206
00:08:30,609 --> 00:08:34,246
YOU KNOW, THIS BLENDER WILL GIVE
ME A NICE BEVELED EDGE
ON HER THERE.

207
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:49,494
ALL RIGHT, NOW THAT I GOT THE
SIDES ALL SHAPED THERE,

208
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:50,962
I GOTTA BE DRILLIN'
SOME HOLES.

209
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:53,632
NOW, THE CRIBBAGE BOARD,
YOU GOT TWO ROWS OF HOLES, EH?

210
00:08:53,698 --> 00:08:55,166
NOW, THAT'S A
LOT OF DRILLING,

211
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,635
EVEN IF YOU HAD A DRILL.

212
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:59,304
BUT HERE'S A WAY TO USE
A COMMON HOUSEHOLD MIXER

213
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:01,940
TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY.

214
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,253
ALL RIGHT, NOW, MAYBE CLEAN-UP
IS A FACTOR FOR YOU,

215
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,823
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE MY
LOCATION OR MY ATTITUDE.

216
00:09:18,857 --> 00:09:22,160
MAYBE YOU'RE IN A CONDO
OR A FREEHOLD TOWNHOUSE

217
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:25,330
OR CARDBOARD ENCLOSURE
OF SOME KIND,

218
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:28,833
YOU CAN'T AFFORD A HEAVY DUTY
INDUSTRIAL VACUUM CLEANER.

219
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:32,270
YOU DON'T NEED IT.

220
00:09:32,604 --> 00:09:35,874
ALL YOU NEED IS A VEHICLE,
AND I'M SURE YOU'VE GOT
ONE OF THOSE AROUND.

221
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,809
YEAH, 'CAUSE A CAR ENGINE
IS JUST BASICALLY

222
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:39,644
JUST A BIG AIR PUMP.

223
00:09:39,677 --> 00:09:42,514
YOU KNOW, I GOT THIS IDEA
FROM A TEENAGER IN TOWN.

224
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,750
HE YELLED AT ME,
HEY, MAN, YOUR CAR SUCKS!

225
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,019
HERE'S ANOTHER BONUS.

226
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:50,889
A HIGH COMPRESSION ENGINE MAKES
GREAT LITTLE DOWELS

227
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:52,257
THAT YOU CAN USE
AS GAME PIECES.

228
00:09:56,694 --> 00:09:58,163
IT IS JUST THAT SIMPLE.

229
00:09:58,196 --> 00:10:00,498
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

230
00:10:00,532 --> 00:10:02,767
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

231

52, 54, 56, 58,
DOUBLE RUN, 16,

232

TWO FOR THE NINE,
ONE FOR THE JACK --

233
00:10:11,142 --> 00:10:14,712
I WANNA TALK TO YOU OLDER GUYS
ABOUT THE SCARIEST PAGE
IN THE NEWSPAPER,

234
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:17,015
THE OBITUARIES.

235
00:10:17,048 --> 00:10:19,117
OH, WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG,
YOU DON'T EVEN LOOK
AT THEM, DO YOU?

236
00:10:19,183 --> 00:10:21,753
THEN MAYBE A FRIEND OF
YOURS HAS A GREAT UNCLE

237
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:24,756
WHO PASSED AWAY DURING AN
ALTERCATION WITH A CLIFF.

238
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:27,659
AND YOU LOOK IN THE OBITUARIES,
AND YOU FIND HIS NAME.

239
00:10:27,725 --> 00:10:29,127
THEN AS TIME GOES ON,

240
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,962
YOU FIND MORE AND MORE
PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW

241
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:32,230
ARE PACKING IT IN.

242
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:33,698
BUT THEY'RE USUALLY OLDER
THAN YOU, YOU KNOW?

243
00:10:33,731 --> 00:10:35,900
LIKE DOCTORS,
PRINCIPALS, GOLF PROS,

244
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:37,235
THAT KIND OF THING.

245
00:10:37,268 --> 00:10:39,270
AND THEN MORE TIME GOES BY,

246
00:10:39,337 --> 00:10:42,540
AND PEOPLE YOUR OWN AGE
ARE LEAVING US, YOU KNOW?

247
00:10:42,607 --> 00:10:45,843
AND YOU START GOING DOWN
THE COLUMN THERE,

248
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,645
LOOKING FOR FAMILIAR NAMES.

249
00:10:47,712 --> 00:10:50,315
IT'S LIKE LOOKING AT THE LIST OF
THE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM

250
00:10:50,348 --> 00:10:54,752
AND BEING REAL GLAD YOU
DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT.

251
00:10:55,053 --> 00:10:57,755
NOW, IT WORRIES ME 'CAUSE YOU
GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU'RE
LOOKING AT THE OBITUARIES

252
00:10:57,822 --> 00:10:59,857
THE FIRST PAGE EVERY TIME YOU
PICK UP THE NEWSPAPER.

253
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:02,960
SO I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE
A LITTLE DEAL HERE, ALL RIGHT?

254
00:11:02,994 --> 00:11:05,563
THE BUNCH OF US,
ON MY 85th BIRTHDAY,

255
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,932
LET'S ALL OF US MEET
HERE AT THE LODGE.

256
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:11,436
WE'LL DO A DRIVE-BY
MOONING OF CITY HALL.

257
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:13,705

ALIVE TILL THEN;

258
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:15,473

DOWN A PAIR OF CHEEKS

259

PRESSED UP AGAINST THE
WINDOW OF THE TOUR BUS.

260
00:11:18,076 --> 00:11:19,610
SO I'M TELLING YOU,

261
00:11:19,677 --> 00:11:22,280
I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING
I CAN TO STAY IN SHAPE
AND LIVE THAT LONG,

262
00:11:22,313 --> 00:11:24,615
AND I'M EXPECTING YOU
TO HOLD UP YOUR END.

263
00:11:26,017 --> 00:11:28,286
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

264
00:11:28,352 --> 00:11:29,420
WE'RE ALL IN
THIS TOGETHER.

[ APPLAUSE ]

266
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:37,929
WELL, I'M ALMOST READY FOR MY
PLUNGE OVER ROCK REEF FALLS
IN A BEER BARREL.

267
00:11:37,995 --> 00:11:40,965
YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE ARE
ASKING ME WHY I WOULD DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

268
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:42,600
AND I HAVE NO
ANSWER FOR THEM.

269
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:45,002
BUT THEN THERE'S OTHER GUYS,
GUYS LIKE ME,

270
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:48,639
GUYS WHO HAVE NEVER
DONE ANYTHING SIGNIFICANT
IN THEIR WHOLE LIVES,

271
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:53,277
EXCEPT MAYBE ONE TIME AT
AN ALL YOU CAN EAT THING.

272
00:11:53,611 --> 00:11:55,980
THEY KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

273
00:11:56,013 --> 00:11:59,884
THEY UNDERSTAND THAT SOMETIMES
A MAN'S JUST GOTTA DO

274
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:03,354
WHAT A WOMAN WOULD
NEVER CONSIDER.

275
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:05,656
I GOT THE PADDING
AND I GOT THE SAFETY GEAR.

276
00:12:05,723 --> 00:12:06,824
RED.
YEAH.

277
00:12:06,891 --> 00:12:08,226
I GOTTA
TALK TO YOU.
WHAT?

278
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:11,195
WELL, I'VE BEEN DOING SOME
MEASURING AND WHAT NOT,

279
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:13,331
AND I THINK YOU HAVE SOME
ENGINEERING FLAWS

280
00:12:13,397 --> 00:12:17,134
IN THIS BEER IMPREGNATED
DAREDEVIL FIASCO OF YOURS.

281
00:12:17,168 --> 00:12:18,436
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT, WINSTON?

282
00:12:18,469 --> 00:12:20,938
WELL, OKAY, GIVEN THE DIMENSIONS
OF THE INSIDE OF THE BARREL

283
00:12:21,005 --> 00:12:23,174
AND THE BARREL'S
STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY,

284
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:25,109
YOU'RE THE WRONG MAN
FOR THE JOB.

285
00:12:25,176 --> 00:12:26,677
OH, YEAH, YOU GOT
TOO MUCH HEIGHT

286
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:29,180
AND TOO MUCH, UH --
WHAT?

287
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:31,015
HOW DO I PUT
THIS DELICATELY?

288
00:12:31,048 --> 00:12:33,618
DENSITY!
TOO MUCH DENSITY.

289
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:35,486
YOU SAYIN' THE BARREL
WILL BREAK APART?

290
00:12:35,553 --> 00:12:41,392
YEAH, TRY TO IMAGINE A WATER
BALLOON HITTING THE PAVEMENT
FROM 12 FLOORS UP.

291
00:12:41,726 --> 00:12:44,261
YEAH, YOU NEED A SMALLER,
LIGHTER GUY.

292
00:12:44,295 --> 00:12:46,197
YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY ABOUT
MY SIZE, FOR INSTANCE.

293
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,698
AND SOMEBODY WHO
ISN'T MARRIED, EITHER.

294
00:12:47,765 --> 00:12:49,834
I'M SURE BERNICE ISN'T TOO
THRILLED WITH THIS IDEA.

295
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,669
NO, SHE'S
FINE WITH IT.

296
00:12:54,171 --> 00:12:56,007
YOU, UH, YOU HAVEN'T
TOLD HER, HUH?

297
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,842
NO, NO, I --
HM-MMM.

298
00:12:57,908 --> 00:13:00,144
BUT, WINSTON,
HOW CAN I BE A MAN

299
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:02,146
IF I DON'T EVEN DO
THE STUNT MYSELF?

300
00:13:02,213 --> 00:13:03,714
'CAUSE IT WAS
YOUR IDEA.

301
00:13:03,781 --> 00:13:05,082
THAT'S THE MAIN THING.

302
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:07,551
OH, SURE, ANYBODY CAN DO
SOMETHING STUPID.

303
00:13:07,618 --> 00:13:09,253
IT'S BEING ABLE
TO THINK IT UP.

304
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,889
THERE'S THE
REAL GIFT.

305
00:13:12,189 --> 00:13:13,691
YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT
ABOUT THAT, WINSTON.

306
00:13:13,724 --> 00:13:14,892
HEY,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:13:14,925 --> 00:13:17,027
I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU
LOOKING OUT FOR
ME LIKE THAT.

00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:19,196
UH, YOU WERE LOOKING
FOR ME, WINSTON?

309
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,464
NO, I WASN'T.

310
00:13:20,498 --> 00:13:22,099
NO, Mr. GREEN
HERE WAS.

311
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:26,036

EXCITING OPPORTUNITY
FOR YOU THERE.

315
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:59,270
THANKS FOR LETTING ME
FINISH MY LAUNDRY, RED.

316
00:14:00,771 --> 00:14:03,207
I'LL TELL YOU,
THE SPIN CYCLE
SCARED ME A LITTLE.

317
00:14:04,341 --> 00:14:06,343
WELL, I DON'T GET
AS DIZZY AS I USED TO.

318
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:08,979
GORD, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

319
00:14:09,046 --> 00:14:10,548
ARE YOU GETTIN' ENOUGH
TO DO UP HERE?

320
00:14:10,614 --> 00:14:12,816
OH, SURE, I'VE GOT
LOTS TO DO.

321
00:14:12,883 --> 00:14:14,585
I MAY BE TOO BUSY.
YEAH?

322
00:14:14,618 --> 00:14:16,320
YEAH, WITH MY
AUDIO RECORDINGS.

323
00:14:16,387 --> 00:14:19,523
OH, BY THE WAY, THIS IS
CALLED AN AUDIO CASSETTE.

324
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,058
IT'S WAY BETTER
THAN AN EIGHT-TRACK.

325
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,994
YOU KNOW, I THINK THESE THINGS
MAY JUST CATCH ON.

326
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:25,896
YEAH, I'M MAKING
MY VERY OWN TAPES.

327
00:14:25,963 --> 00:14:27,898
OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA SING, ARE YOU, GORD?

328
00:14:27,931 --> 00:14:29,767
NO, NO, I DON'T LIKE
MUSIC ANYMORE,

329
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,269
NOT SINCE THE
CAPTAIN & TENILLE SPLIT UP.

330
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:35,272
NO, I'M RECORDING THE
SOUNDS OF NATURE ON TAPE.

331
00:14:35,306 --> 00:14:36,640
WELL, THAT'S
A GOOD IDEA

'CAUSE YOU'RE UP HERE
IN NATURE, YOU KNOW.

333

AND YOU CAN JUST GET
ALL THE SOUNDS.

334
00:14:40,044 --> 00:14:42,346
PEOPLE WOULD PROBABLY GIVE
YOU MONEY FOR THOSE
TAPES, YOU KNOW,

335
00:14:42,413 --> 00:14:45,049
BECAUSE ENVIRONMENTAL SOUNDS

I'M ONLY HALF DONE.

THEY SHOULD --

OF YOU AND ME ARGUING.

BUT THAT'S --
THAT'S NOT HOW NATURE --

351
00:15:32,229 --> 00:15:34,631
WHAT YOU DO IS TAKE
THE MACHINE OUTSIDE.

352

MICROPHONE CATCH WHATEVER

NO EFFORT AT ALL.

BEEN A DIFFERENT STORY

THAT MAN WHO GOT ME UP IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

00:18:59,769 --> 00:19:03,540
BECAUSE THE COPS HAD PICKED
HIM UP TRYING TO GET
CHOSEN BY ALIENS

436
00:19:03,573 --> 00:19:06,443
TO FLY OFF INTO
THE FINAL FRONTIER,

437
00:19:06,476 --> 00:19:09,245
MIGHT FEEL HE OWED ME
AT LEAST AN EXPLANATION.

438
00:19:09,312 --> 00:19:10,880
ALL RIGHT, RED,
IF YOU MUST KNOW.

439
00:19:10,947 --> 00:19:13,283
IT WAS THE POLICE
BAND RADIO IN MY CAR.

440

THOSE ARE ILLEGAL, DALTON.

I'M RIDING IN MY CAR,

443
00:19:18,888 --> 00:19:20,957
I TURN ON THE RADIO,

444
00:19:21,024 --> 00:19:24,294
AND THERE ARE THE COPS,
THEY'RE ALL EXCITED ABOUT
SOME REPORTED U.F.O.

445
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,930
IN THE FIELD NORTH
OF THE OLD SWITCH ROAD,

446
00:19:26,963 --> 00:19:30,366
AND I HEAD RIGHT OVER THERE,
AND IT IS A TRAP.

447
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,036
EVERY CAR IN TOWN WITH A POLICE
BAND RADIO WAS THERE.

448
00:19:33,069 --> 00:19:35,138
THE COPS NAILED
EVERY ONE OF THEM.

449
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:37,207
THAT'S PRETTY SMART.

450
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,275
YOU SURE IT
WAS OUR COPS?

451
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:44,180
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.
MAYBE THOSE WEREN'T OUR COPS.

452
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:47,450
MAYBE THOSE WERE ALIENS IN
THE BODIES OF OUR COPS.

453
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:49,319
OH,
COME ON, DALTON.

454
00:19:49,352 --> 00:19:50,486
IF YOU WERE AN ALIEN,

455
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,121
AND YOU COULD PICK ANY
BODY IN POSSUM LAKE,

456
00:19:52,155 --> 00:19:54,891
WOULD YOU PICK CHIEF
TACKLEBERRY'S?

457
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:58,695
YOU SEEM TO HAVE THIS
BELIEF THAT SOMETHING'S
GONNA COME OUT OF THE SKY

458
00:19:58,761 --> 00:19:59,996
AND TAKE YOU AWAY
