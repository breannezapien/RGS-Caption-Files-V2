1
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,837
I KNOW WE ALL WANT 
TO CELEBRATE NEW YEAR'S

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:07,173
BUT WHEN YOU'RE ALONE,
THERE'S A REAL DANGER OF
GOING OVER THE LINE

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:10,643
BETWEEN HARMLESS INDISCRETION
AND SERIOUS JAIL TIME.

4
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:13,413
AND THAT LINE IS USUALLY
CONNECTED TO THE AMOUNT
AND FREQUENCY

5
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:15,415
OF YOUR ALCOHOL INTAKE.

6
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:16,449
YOU SEE, WHEN YOU'RE ALONE,

7
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:19,919
YOU DON'T HAVE AN ALCOHOL
CONSUMPTION CONSULTANT NEARBY,

8
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:22,555
LIKE, SAY, A POLICEMAN
OR MEMBER OF THE CLERGY

9
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,358
OR THE ULTIMATE AUTHORITY:
YOUR OWN WIFE.

10
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:28,828
SO HERE'S SOMETHING YOU CAN
DO TO STOP YOURSELF FROM
DRINKING TOO MUCH.

11
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:32,999
OPEN UP YOUR CLOCK RADIO,
BREAK INTO THE SNOOZE
CONTROL CIRCUIT.

12
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:34,734
IT'S NOT HARD TO FIND.

13
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:37,203
JUST KEEP TOUCHING WIRES AND
PUSHING THE SNOOZE BUTTON.

14
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,472
YOU'LL FIND THE
RIGHT ONES IN NO TIME.

15
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,176
NOW, THE WAY A SNOOZE
ALARM WORKS NORMALLY IS

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,679
YOU PRESS THE BUTTON, IT SHUTS
THE RADIO OFF FOR AN HOUR.

17
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:49,849
BUT FOR OUR PURPOSES
I'M GOING TO SPLICE INTO

18
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,852
THE DISPENSING CIRCUIT
OF THIS POP MACHINE.

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,622
OKAY, UH --

20
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:57,457
YOU MIGHT WANNA
UNPLUG HER FIRST,

21
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,859
BUT I DON'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF TIME.

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,864
OKAY, NOW WHAT HAPPENS
IS YOU TAKE ALL THE
POP OUTTA THERE

23
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:07,834
AND REPLACE IT WITH CANS OF
YOUR FAVOURITE FERMENTED
BEVERAGE.

24
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:09,903
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
NOW IT'S NEW YEAR'S.

25
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:12,205
YOU FEEL LIKE A BREWSKIE,
YOU PRESS THE BUTTON,

26
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:14,507
WHICH ALSO ACTIVATES
THE SNOOZE CONTROL.

27
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,547
AND NOW YOU CAN'T HAVE
ANOTHER BEER FOR AN HOUR.

28
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,285
HAPPY NEW YEAR.

29
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:44,270
[cheers and applause]

30
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,072
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

31
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:47,874
ALL RIGHT.

32
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,943
[cheers and applause continue]

33
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,544
WE APPRECIATE THAT.

34
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,113
WELCOME TO OUR
NEW YEAR'S SPECIAL.

35
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,681
WE'VE NEVER DONE
ONE BEFORE.

36
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,616
I'M SURE THAT'LL BECOME
PAINFULLY OBVIOUS

37
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:58,651
IN THE
NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE.

38
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,220
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.

39
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,988
I DON'T.

40
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,623
WE HAVE A GREAT
SHOW FOR YOU.

41
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:06,092
IT'S OUR WAY OF HELPING YOU
BRING IN THE NEW YEAR.

42
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,594
THAT'S RIGHT.

43
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,662
AND ANYBODY OUT THERE
WHO'S MAYBE OVER 40

44
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,132
AND YOU GOT A COUPLE OF KIDS
AND YOU WANNA CELEBRATE
NEW YEAR'S EARLY

45
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:15,802
AND BE IN BED SAWING 'EM
BY THE TIME MIDNIGHT
COMES AROUND,

46
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:18,438
BOY, I ENVY YOU.
[ TOY HORN BLASTS ]

47
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,040
THERE'S THAT WET
BLANKET THING AGAIN.

48
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:23,943
LISTEN, YOU JUST
DO WHATEVER WORKS
FOR YOU, OKAY?

49
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,813
WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE
YOU LOOK FORWARD TO
A HAPPY NEW YEAR!

50
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,481
YEAH, THAT'S ALL
I'M SAYING,

51
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,083
BECAUSE THEY MAY HAVE
HAD A CRAPPY OLD YEAR.

52
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,651
THAT'S ALL --

53
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:34,521
NO, NO, UNCLE RED.
THIS IS NEW YEAR'S.

54
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,190
IT'S A TIME OF EXPECTATIONS
AND OPTIMISM, YOU KNOW!

55
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,959
CAN WE SEE A
LITTLE ENTHUSIASM
AND EXCITEMENT, PLEASE?

56
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:43,696
YOU KNOW, HAROLD,
I DON'T LIKE EXCITEMENT. YOU KNOW?

57
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,166
EXCITEMENT ENDS UP
IN THE HOSPITAL --

58
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,003
SOMETIMES THE
MATERNITY WARD.

59
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,572
BUT I THINK IF
WE WORK TOGETHER,

60
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,007
I THINK WE'LL GET
THROUGH THIS JUST FINE.

61
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,775
WE'RE NOT GONNA
"GET THROUGH IT,"

62
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,443
WE'RE GOING TO
CELEBRATE IT!

63
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,179
ALL RIGHT.
IT'S NEW YEAR'S!

64
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,480
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE GONNA CELEBRATE!

65
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,215
OKAY.
ENTHUSIASM RIGHT NOW.
I WANNA SEE SOME

66
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:03,783
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

67
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,752
ALL RIGHT, UH,
LET'S WHOOP IT UP.

68
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:08,521
LET'S WHOOP IT UP, UH,
AND, HEY, LET'S PARTY.

69
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:09,956
LET'S PARTY.

70
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,457
THERE WE GO,
LET'S PARTY.

71
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,293
THAT'S IT?

72
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,961
"WHOOP IT UP"?

73
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,896
WHOOP?
OOH, THEY'RE
GOIN' NUTS, HUH?

74
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,932
WHOOP IT UP.

75
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,633
WELL, YOU GOTTA GO --
COME ON, LET'S GO!

76
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:21,968
COME ON, LET'S --

77
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,703
IT'S TIME TO
PAR-TAY, MY PEEPS.

78
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,439
[cheers and laughter]

79
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:30,109
[applause]

80
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,513
WHERE DID WE GO WRONG
WITH YOU, HAROLD?

81
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,048
WELL, IT WAS ALL THOSE YEARS

82
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,450
OF NOT GETTING THE
RESPECT I DESERVE.

83
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,886
YOU GOT WHAT YOU DESERVED;
IT JUST WASN'T RESPECT,
THAT'S ALL.

84
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,163
IT'S TIME FOR
THE POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

85
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:53,866
[cheers and applause]

86
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:00,306
TODAY'S WINNER RECEIVES
A FREE TUXEDO RENTAL

87
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,675
FROM FEATHERSTONE'S
FUNERAL HOME.

88
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,413
TUXEDO NOT AVAILABLE
ON SATURDAYS.

89
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,215
OKAY, DALTON,
COVER YOUR EARS.

90
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,317
HAROLD, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO GET DALTON HUMPHREY

91
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,685
TO SAY THIS WORD...

92
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,687
KISS

93
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:16,623
KISS

94
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,091
OKAY, OKAY,
OKAY.

95
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,325
AND GO!

96
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,860
OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
MR. DALTON,

97
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,462
UM, THIS IS SOMETHING YOU AND
YOUR WIFE SHARE ON NEW YEAR'S.

98
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,631
CAB FARE.

99
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:27,300
NO, NO, UM --
OKAY, IT'S NEW YEAR'S EVE,

100
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,802
AND YOU'RE DANCING,
AND IT'S MIDNIGHT,

101
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,838
AND ALL YOU WANT IS A...

102
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:34,274
BACK PILL.

103
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,875
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S FORGET NEW YEAR'S.

104
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,210
FORGET NEW YEAR'S.
IT'S GONE.

105
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,012
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, THIS MORNING
WHEN YOU LEFT THE HOUSE,

106
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,647
YOU GAVE YOUR WIFE...

107
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:43,216
OH-HO!
TIME TO COOL OFF.

108
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,819
FURTHER BACK.
LET'S GO FURTHER BACK.

109
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,589
UM, OH, OKAY.
AFTER YOU SAID
YOUR WEDDING VOWS,

110
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,424
THE MINISTER TOLD YOU TO...

111
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,593
RECONSIDER.

112
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,128
DID HE REALLY?

113
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:57,263
YOU'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.
HE WOULD SAY THAT.
IT'S SO BIZARRE

114
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,332
OH! OKAY, YEAH.
WELL, OKAY.

115
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,301
ALL RIGHT, MR. DALTON,
THIS IS -- LET'S SEE.

116
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,303
THE LAST TIME YOU HAD
A ROMANTIC EVENING
WITH YOUR WIFE,

117
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:04,937
WHAT DID YOU DO?

118
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,040
OH, I WENT TO THAT NEW
RESTAURANT IN PORT ASBESTOS.

119
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,975
THERE'S 20 BUCKS
I CAN KISS GOOD-BYE.

120
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,643
[bell ringing]

121
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,813
[applause]

122
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:19,352
RED ASKED ME TO JOT DOWN A FEW
OF MY NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS

123
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:21,454
AND SHARE 'EM WITH YOU.

124
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,357
I'M GONNA HAVE TO DO SOME
OF THESE FROM MEMORY.

125
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,727
I WROTE DOWN A COUPLE,
AND THEN I DROPPED THE PEN.

126
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:31,464
[clears throat]

127
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,600
ON THE PERSONAL SIDE,

128
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:39,739
I'M GONNA FOCUS MORE OF MY
FREE TIME ON ART AND
LITERATURE.

129
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,607
SO I'M GETTING
A SATELLITE DISH

130
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,077
AND SOME OF
THOSE BOOKS ON TAPE.

131
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:49,148
I'M ALSO PLANNING TO
DISCONTINUE THE SERVICE
SIDE OF THE MARINA.

132
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:52,418
DEALING WITH PEOPLE
WHOSE BOATS AREN'T WORKING

133
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:56,289
IS JUST NOT AN ENJOYABLE
WAY TO MAKE A LIVING.

134
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,826
A LOT OF THEM EXPECT THE BOATS
TO BE FIXED PROMPTLY

135
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,561
AND PROPERLY.

136
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:05,665
THEY DON'T SEEM TO REALISE
IT'S MY SUMMER TOO.

137
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,901
SO STARTIN' THIS YEAR,

138
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,871
WE'RE GONNA SPECIALISE
IN SALES ONLY.

139
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:14,407
YOU WANNA BUY A BOAT FROM ME,
IT'S CASH UP FRONT

140
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,343
AND NO TEST DRIVES.

141
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:21,581
WE ALSO DON'T HONOUR ANY MORE
FACTORY WARRANTEES.

142
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:24,917
THEY SHOULD BUILD 'EM
BETTER IN THE FIRST PLACE.

143
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:29,756
AND FINALLY, I'M GONNA TRY AND
CUT DOWN ON MY WORK HOURS.

144
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:33,259
LAST YEAR I TRIED
THAT 40 HOUR THING,

145
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:36,362
BUT THAT WORKED OUT TO OVER
THREE HOURS A MONTH.

146
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:41,367
OH, IT'S NAP TIME.

147
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,469
[sighs]

148
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,673
HAD A BIT OF A CAR
ACCIDENT THIS MORNING.

149
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:51,811
YOU KNOW, I USED TO BE
ABLE TO DRIVE STANDARD
TRANSMISSION NO PROBLEM.

150
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,913
BUT NOW WITH
THE TRICK KNEE --

151
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,384
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE
SPINNING PLAYGROUND RIDES.

152
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,820
LUCKILY, THERE WERE
NO KIDS AROUND.

153
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,688
THEY'D ALREADY BEEN
ON IT FOR FIVE MINUTES,

154
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:06,025
SO THEY WERE OVER
IN THE BUSHES BARFING.

155
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,895
I TELL YOU, GOOD THING
DALTON WASN'T WITH ME.

156
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,098
THIS IS HIS CAR.

157
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,710
YEAH, SHE'S JAMMED
ON THERE PRETTY GOOD.

158
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,913
JUST SPINS AROUND
IN A CIRCLE.

159
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,581
BUT I'M THINKIN',
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

160
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:31,184
THIS IS NEW YEAR'S EVE,
AND THIS ROTATING CAR

161
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,253
COULD BE CONVERTED
INTO A DANDY NOISE MAKER.

162
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,355
I GOT EVERYTHING
I NEED RIGHT HERE.

163
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,491
ANYBODY WITH HALF
A BRAIN COULD DO THIS.

164
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,462
[laughter]

165
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,063
WE GOTTA HAVE
MUSIC AT MIDNIGHT,

166
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,932
SO I HOOKED THIS SPEAKER
UP TO THE EIGHT-TRACK,

167
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,500
AND RIGHT AT THE
STROKE OF 12,

168
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,368
WE'RE GOING TO BE LISTENING
TO "AULD LANG SYNE"

169
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:52,972
PLAYED BY GUY LINGUINE
AND HIS ROYAL CUSTODIANS.

170
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,508
BUT MAINLY WHAT
WE NEED IS NOISE.

171
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,077
SO I'VE ATTACHED A
TAMBOURINE TO MY DRIVE WHEEL;

172
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:02,048
MEANWHILE, I GOT MARACAS
PLAYING WIPE OUT ON
THE WINDSHIELD.

173
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,816
AND AS A SPECIAL TREAT

174
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,385
I WEDGED A TROMBONE
IN THE TAILPIPE.

175
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,621
NOT OFTEN YOU SEE A CAR
WITH A HORN IN THE BACK.

176
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,456
I GUESS IT'S A GUY THING.

177
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,391
[trombone blasts note]

178
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,028
OKAY, THAT'S A GOOD START.

179
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,030
BUT WHEN IT COMES
TO BEING ANNOYING,

180
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,032
WE'VE ONLY BEGUN TO
SCRATCH THE SURFACE.

181
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,917
A SNOW FENCE IS THE PERFECT
ADDITION TO A NEW YEAR'S PARTY

182
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,819
BECAUSE IT'S JUST
LIKE THE GUESTS...

183
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,587
IT STANDS AROUND
LOOKING GOOFY,

184
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:44,123
AND WHEN YOU NEED IT,
IT FALLS OVER.

185
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,492
HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE AS
NOISY AS THE GUESTS TOO,

186
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,929
ESPECIALLY WHEN THESE HOCKEY
STICKS START RAKING ACROSS IT.

187
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,265
I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR A TEST RUN.

188
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:55,268
I GOT HER IN GEAR, AND I
HOOKED UP THIS REMOTE STARTER,

189
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:58,304
SO I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO
BE IN THE CAR WHEN IT
STARTS SPINNING.

190
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,273
I'VE PRETTY WELL THOUGHT
OF EVERYTHING.

191
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:05,278
HMM.

192
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,081
audience: O-O-H!

193
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,785
ALL RIGHT, NO,
I'M FINE.

194
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,487
IT'S AN EMBARRASSING PLACE
TO HAVE TO HAVE A BRUISE,

195
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,322
BUT AFTER 35 YEARS
OF MARRIAGE,

196
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,824
SADLY, NO ONE'S
GONNA NOTICE.

197
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:21,160
ALL RIGHT, LET'S PRETEND
IT'S MIDNIGHT.

198
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,695
LET'S DO THE
COUNTDOWN TOGETHER...

199
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:23,629
THREE,

200
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:24,330
TWO,

201
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:25,197
ONE,

202
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,232
HAPPY NEW YEAR!

203
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,937
[engine revving]

204
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:38,511
[instruments playing]

205
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:54,660
[applause]

206
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,533
YOU KNOW, IN HONOUR
OF NEW YEAR'S,

207
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,901
WE HAVE A SPECIAL
PRESENTATION

208
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:05,237
BY LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL
OFFICER, ED FRID.

209
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,473
ED, TELL EVERYONE
WHAT BROUGHT YOU HERE.

210
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:10,910
WELL, I WAS ASKED TO
MAKE A PRESENTATION
INVOLVING ANIMALS,

211
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,412
ONE THAT WOULD KICK OFF
THE NEW YEAR TO A GOOD START,

212
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,148
AND, UH, I THINK
I'VE DONE THAT.

213
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,353
YOU DON'T SEEM
VERY ENTHUSED, ED.

214
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:23,689
WELL, RED, NORMALLY THIS
IS MY VACATION TIME,

215
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:24,991
A TIME TO BE AWAY
FROM ANIMALS,

216
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,727
A TIME TO REFLECT
AND REVIEW THE RESULTS

217
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,029
OF MY VARIOUS MEDICAL TESTS.

218
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,932
HOW DID THOSE
MEDICAL TESTS GO?

219
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,434
WELL, THE FLEA AND TICK
THING TURNED OUT
TO BE NOTHING.

220
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,672
AND THE HOOF AND MOUTH
CAME BACK NEGATIVE.

221
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,308
[voice breaks]
RABIES IS THE BIG ONE.

222
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,910
WE'RE ALL HOPIN'
FOR THE BEST.

223
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,813
TO ME THAT'S ALL THE MORE
REASON TO HAVE A BIG
CELEBRATION NOW,

224
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,615
SO TELL US ABOUT IT.

225
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:51,784
OKAY, WELL, I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE A GOOD OMEN

226
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:55,054
TO RELEASE A FLOCK OF DOVES
TO START OFF THE NEW YEAR.

227
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,089
YOU SEE, THE DOVE HAS
BEEN A SYMBOL OF PEACE

228
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,158
SINCE THE DAYS OF
NOAH'S ARK

229
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,828
WHEN IT RETURNED TO THE SHIP
WITH AN OLIVE BRANCH
IN ITS CLAWS.

230
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,897
YEAH, ACTUALLY,
YOU OWE A LOT TO NOAH

231
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:08,067
BECAUSE HIS ARK SAVED
ALL THE ANIMALS FROM
BEING EXTINCT.

232
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,935
I HATE NOAH!
OKAY

233
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,471
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

234
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:15,808
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S NOT DWELL
ON THE NEGATIVE.

235
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,678
LET'S GET ON WITH OUR
PRESENTATION, EH?

236
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,880
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO
TO HELP RELEASE THE DOVES?

237
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,416
I RECOMMEND YOU
STAND WELL BACK,

238
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,284
AND COVER YOUR
EYES WITH SOMETHING,

239
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:29,255
PREFERABLY SOMETHING HARDER
THAN A DOVE'S BEAK.

240
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,625
AND ONCE THEY GET UP
IN THE AIR, THEY GET
EASILY EXCITED,

241
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,894
SO I WOULDN'T STAND
UNDER THEM, OKAY?

242
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,363
OKAY, WELL,
WE'RE ALL READY,

243
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,597
SO LET'S RELEASE
THE DOVES.

244
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,266
YEAH, WE DON'T GO
WHEN YOU'RE READY;

245
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,967
WE GO WHEN I'M READY.

246
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:44,170
OKAY.
SORRY, ED.

247
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,939
I THOUGHT WE HAD AN
UNDERSTANDING, RED.
I KNOW! I KNOW!

248
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:48,374
I'M FINE. I'M GOOD.
YOU GO WHEN YOU'RE READY.

249
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,042
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

250
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,244
LET THESE DOVES
MARK THE BEGINNING

251
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:55,781
OF A PEACEFUL AND
PROSPEROUS NEW YEAR!

252
00:11:55,848 --> 00:12:04,190
[laughter]

253
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,927
NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS,
YEAH, I GOT A FEW.

254
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,096
I'VE ALWAYS GOT A FEW.

255
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:13,666
YOU SEE, MY MENTOR
AND PERSONAL GURU,
ANTHONY ANTHONY,

256
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:17,169
HE'S ADAMANT ABOUT
THE IMPORTANCE OF
SELF-IMPROVEMENT.

257
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,538
AND HE'S MADE A LOT OF MONEY
MAKING GUYS LIKE ME

258
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,040
A BETTER PERSON.

259
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:25,077
OKAY, THIS YEAR I WANNA TRY
AND NOT BE SO JUDGMENTAL.

260
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:29,482
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE
DISRESPECTFUL OF ME,

261
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:33,252
AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THEY
SEE THE SEPTIC SUCKING
BUSINESS I HAVE

262
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:36,522
AND THE DRY SEWAGE
ENCRUSTED ON THE HOSES,

263
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,858
AND NATURALLY,
THEY'RE JEALOUS.

264
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:42,094
SEE, NOT EVERYONE
CAN BE AN ENTREPRENEUR.

265
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,929
NOT EVERYONE CAN
BE A SUCCESS.

266
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,098
NOT EVERYONE CAN
SUCK CESS.

267
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,733
AND I HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT.

268
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,969
I HAVE TO BE SENSITIVE
TO THEIR PAIN

269
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:52,838
IN THEIR BORING OFFICE JOBS
WITH NO FUTURE

270
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:56,675
AND NOT EVEN A WHIFF
OF THE KIND OF LIFE I HAVE.

271
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,011
SO NO MATTER WHAT
THEY CALL ME,

272
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,480
I WILL NOT RETALIATE.

273
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,215
I'M GONNA RISE ABOVE IT.

274
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,784
AND THAT'S
IMPORTANT, YOU KNOW,

275
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:08,454
'CAUSE IN THE SEWAGE BUSINESS,
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE
TO RISE ABOVE IT.

276
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,722
HAPPY NEW YEAR.

277
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,458
[applause]

278
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,961
WE NOW COME TO THAT
PORTION OF THE SHOW

279
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:18,097
WHERE WE ADDRESS
THOSE THREE LITTLE WORDS

280
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,299
THAT MEN FIND
SO HARD TO SAY...

281
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,968
audience: I DON'T KNOW!

282
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:25,237
[giggling]

283
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,541
OKAY, TODAY'S LETTER
READS AS FOLLOWS...

284
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,210
"DEAR EXPERTS,
ALL MY LIFE I'VE SUNG

285
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:34,146
"'AULD LANG SYNE'
EVERY NEW YEAR'S.

286
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,182
"IT MAKES ME
VERY EMOTIONAL.

"MY QUESTION IS: WHAT THE HECK
IS THE SONG ABOUT?"

289
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,657
WELL, I HAVE NO IDEA,
BUT IT'S SCOTTISH,

290
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,625
SO IT'S PROBABLY SAD.

291
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,828
IT'S THE BAGPIPES.

292
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:51,597
WHENEVER I HEAR BAGPIPES
IT BRINGS ME TO TEARS.

293
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,165
YEAH, ME TOO.

294
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,301
I SMILE WHEN
THEY STOP, THOUGH.

295
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,370
YOU KNOW, IT'S OBVIOUS
THAT YOU TWO

296
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,306
KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT SCOTLAND.

297
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,874
FOR EXAMPLE, DID YOU
KNOW THAT IN SCOTLAND

298
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,176
NEW YEAR'S IS MORE
POPULAR THAN CHRISTMAS?

299
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:07,379
IS THAT BECAUSE
THEY DON'T HAVE
TO BUY PRESENTS?

300
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:09,748
NO, NO, NO.

301
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:13,118
IT'S BECAUSE NEW YEAR'S
AND SCOTLAND PREDATES
CHRISTIANITY.

302
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:13,953
IT'S NOT EVEN
CALLED NEW YEAR'S;

303
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,654
IT'S CALLED HOGMANAY.

304
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,958
IT MEANS 'THE MOON
OF THE HAG.'

305
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,227
WELL, I DON'T THINK
THAT THE MOON FROM A HAG

306
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:24,096
WOULD BE SOMETHING
I'D EVER WANNA SEE.

307
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,699
NO, NO, NO.

308
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,667
IT REFERS TO
A DATE, MIKE.

309
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,603
IT'S KIND OF LIKE A
SUPERSTITIOUS THING.

310
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,872
IT'S BAD LUCK TO
MAKE A MARRIAGE PROPOSAL

311
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,907
OR TO BREAK GLASS
OR TO SPIN FLAX

312
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,675
OR TO CARRY OUT
THE RUBBISH.

313
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,078
I FEEL THAT
WAY EVERY DAY.

314
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,014
OKAY, YOU KNOW, RIGHT AT
THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT

315
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,782
THEY FLING OPEN
THE WINDOWS AND DOORS

316
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:45,217
TO LET OUT THE OLD YEAR

317
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,287
AND DRIVE OUT THE BAD DOGS
OF THE UNDERWORLD.

318
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:51,023
OH, SO THEY TELL THE
NEIGHBOURS TO GO HOME, HUH?

319
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:52,992
NO, NO.
AND THEN MUCH LATER

320
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,361
THE BANDS OF ROVING MEN,
CALLED WASSAILS,

321
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:58,264
GO FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE,
CARRYING A BIG BOWL
OF ALCOHOL

322
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,598
AND ASKING FOR MONEY.

323
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,901
WASSAILS,
I'VE HEARD OF THAT.

324
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,068
OH, SURE YOU HAVE...

325
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:07,006
YO, MIKE, WA-A-A-SSAIL!
WA-A-A-SSAIL!

326
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,474
OH, COME ON.
STOP THAT!

327
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,176
I'M TRYING TO
EDUCATE YOU PEOPLE HERE

328
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:12,878
NOW, COME ON.

329
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:13,679
I'M SORRY.

330
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,080
ARE YOU GUYS
GONNA BE SERIOUS,

331
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,815
OR ARE YOU GONNA
BE GOOFBALLS?

332
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:23,188
IT'S NEW YEAR'S EVE.
I'M GOIN' WITH GOOFBALLS.

333
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,591
WA-A-A-SSAIL!
WA-A-A-SSAIL!

334
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,328
WA-A-A-SSAIL!
WA-A-A-SSAIL!

335
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:37,736
OH, HI, EVERYBODY.

336
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:40,472
RANGER GORD HERE WITH MY
NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS.

337
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:43,509
DO YOU REALISE WHAT AN
ADVANTAGE IT IS TO BE
A FOREST RANGER

338
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,744
WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING
NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS?

339
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,780
I MEAN, YOU PEOPLE,
WHEN YOU MAKE RESOLUTIONS,

340
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,415
YOU'VE GOT FRIENDS
AND FAMILY

341
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,883
AND CO-WORKERS AROUND
YOU EVERY DAY.

342
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,285
IF YOU HAPPEN
TO BREAK ONE OF YOURS,

343
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,055
EVERYBODY KNOWS, RIGHT?

344
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:59,491
YOU POOR,
PATHETIC PEOPLE.

345
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,560
NOW, LOOK AT THE
DEAL I'VE GOT.

346
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,395
I CAN MAKE ANY
RESOLUTION I WANT,

347
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:06,231
AND I CAN BREAK IT,
JUST LIKE THAT.

348
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,533
YOU KNOW WHY?

349
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:11,103
BECAUSE NOBODY EVER
COMES UP HERE, THAT'S WHY.

350
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,739
I MEAN, I COULD DECIDE,
OKAY, THIS YEAR,

351
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,908
I'M NOT GOING TO BATHE.

352
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,176
WHO WOULD KNOW?

353
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,477
JUST ME.

354
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,046
[weeping]
AND THAT'S JUST
THE WAY I LIKE IT.

355
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,848
[sniffling]

356
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,050
I LIKE BEING ALONE.

357
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:28,420
I CAN DO
WHATEVER I WANT.

358
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,888
I COULD SPEND THE WHOLE DAY
LICKING THINGS.

359
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:32,224
[laughter]

360
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:35,027
FRIENDS DON'T LET
YOU DO THAT, BELIEVE ME.

361
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,196
I CAN STAY UP LATE
WATCHING TV,

362
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,365
WATCHING WHATEVER I WANT.

363
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,133
DIDN'T KNOW I
HAD A TV, DID YOU?

364
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,601
WELL, I DO.

365
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:45,604
[weeping]
AND IT'LL WORK A LOT BETTER
WHEN I GET ELECTRICITY.

366
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,843
ANYWAY, I'M NOT GONNA
MAKE ANY RESOLUTIONS

367
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,611
BECAUSE I DON'T NEED ANY.

368
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,947
I LIKE THINGS JUST
THE WAY THEY ARE.

369
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,883
NO NOSY NEIGHBOURS,
NO NOSY BOSSES,

370
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,752
NOBODY AT ALL.

371
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,887
JUST ME.

372
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:04,456
I'M SO LUCKY.

373
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,827
HAPPY NEW YEAR.

374
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:11,964
YOU KNOW, BRINGING
IN THE NEW YEAR

375
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,466
WITH A CELEBRATORY DRINK
IS AN OLD CUSTOM.

376
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,535
IT GOES WAY BACK
TO ANCIENT TIMES.

377
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,270
I BELIEVE IT WAS
JULIUS CAESAR WHO SAID,

378
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,774
"FRIENDS, ROMANS, COUNTRYMEN,
LEND ME YOUR BEERS."

379
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:25,010
OF COURSE, ON NEW YEAR'S EVE
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
DRINKING CHAMPAGNE.

380
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,678
BUT THAT CAN BE A PROBLEM

381
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,647
WHAT WITH FRENCH WINE
BEING SO EXPENSIVE

382
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,816
AND YOU BEING SO CHEAP.

383
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,518
SO HERE'S WHAT YOU DO...

384
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,186
YOU MAKE YOUR OWN.

385
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,388
I START WITH
A GOOD-SIZED JUG.

386
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,690
QUANTITY IS AN
IMPORTANT FACTOR.

387
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,293
I FIND WITH ALCOHOL,
PEOPLE EVEN LIKE
THE BAD STUFF

388
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,728
IF THERE'S PLENTY OF IT.

389
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,296
SO WE'RE GONNA MAKE A MAGNUM.

390
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,065
HERE AGAIN,
MAGNUM IS A LATIN WORD,

391
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,966
MEANING HUMONGOUS.

392
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,669
OKAY, YOU KNOW, CHAMPAGNE
HAS A BIT OF A ZING TO IT.

393
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,805
EVEN THE SMELL
TICKLES YOUR NOSE.

394
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,841
WELL, YOU CAN GET THE SAME
EFFECT WITH VINEGAR.

395
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,178
AH, WHAT THE HECK?
IT'S NEW YEAR'S.

396
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,216
OKAY, NOW YOU FILL UP
THE REST OF YOUR MAGNUM

397
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,518
WITH YOUR FAVOURITE BEER --

398
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,387
OR WHATEVER KIND
DALTON BROUGHT.

399
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,355
HE'LL NEVER NOTICE.

400
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,925
HE'LL BE TOO BUSY
CHASIN' THE SHRIMP RING.

401
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,794
OKAY, NOW WE COME TO
THE FUN PART OF CHAMPAGNE.

402
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,463
I DON'T MEAN THAT
TIPSY FEELING YOU GET

403
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,832
WHEN YOU START DOIN' YOUR
JIMMY STEWART IMPRESSION
ALL NIGHT.

404
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,201
NO, NO, I'M TALKING
ABOUT THE BUBBLES.

405
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,437
NOW, IN REAL CHAMPAGNE THE
BUBBLES COME FROM --

406
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,107
I DUNNO, GRAPES WITH
AIR IN 'EM, OR SOMETHING.

407
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,876
BUT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OUR
BUBBLES BY ADDING BAKING SODA

408
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,811
TO THE VINEGAR WE
ALREADY GOT IN THERE.

409
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:33,712
NOW, HERE'S THE THING.

410
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,281
WE DON'T WANT THOSE CHEMICALS
MIXING TOO SOON.

411
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,951
SO GET YOURSELF SOME
OF THESE COLD CAPSULES

412
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,954
AND EMPTY THEM
INTO A GLASS.

413
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,922
ALL RIGHT, AND SAVE ALL
THAT FOR LATER,

414
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,424
BECAUSE SOME DAY
YOU MAY HAVE A COLD,

415
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,292
AND YOU CAN DRINK THE WHOLE
THING ALL AT ONCE.

416
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,193
IT WON'T DO ANYTHING
FOR YOUR COLD,

417
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,729
BUT IT'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING
THE DOCTORS CAN CURE.

418
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:53,265
OKAY, NOW YOU WANNA
FILL THESE CAPSULES UP

419
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,601
WITH THE BAKING SODA.

420
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:58,437
YEAH, ALL RIGHT, WELL,
I'VE ALREADY DONE A FEW.

421
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,606
SO WE'LL JUST POP
THEM INTO THE MAGNUM.

422
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,845
OKAY, WE JUST GOTTA
GET THE CORK IN THERE

423
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:09,515
BEFORE THOSE CHEMICALS MIX.

424
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,817
ALL RIGHT, NOW GET
YOURSELF SOME CHICKEN WIRE,

425
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,919
NOT JUST FOR
DECORATION ANYMORE.

426
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,622
YOU WANNA USE THAT
TO HOLD THE CORK IN PLACE.

427
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,258
AND THEN FOR THAT LITTLE
EXTRA TOUCH OF CLASS,

428
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:22,361
GET YOURSELF
SOME GOLD FOIL

429
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,831
[muffled]
AND WRAP THAT AROUND...

430
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,969
[chuckling]

431
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:36,808
OKAY, BY MIDNIGHT, THE
CAPSULES WILL BE ALL
DISSOLVED IN THERE,

432
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:41,780
AND THAT'LL ALLOW THE CARBON
DIOXIDE TO COME FIRING
OFF INTO THE BEER

433
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,783
AS THE BAKING SODA MIXES
IN WITH THE VINEGAR.

434
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:48,820
SO NOW ALL'S YOU GOTTA DO IS
REMOVE YOUR FANCY FOIL,

435
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,490
TAKE OFF YOUR PROTECTIVE
CHICKEN WIRE OFF THERE.

436
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,025
AND IF YOU PUT
IN ENOUGH VINEGAR,

437
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,927
YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN
NEED A CORKSCREW.

438
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,729
SO HAPPY NEW YEAR --
OR I SHOULD SAY,

439
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,765
HAPPY NEW BEER.

440
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:05,637
[fizzing sound]

441
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,441
[fizzing stops]

442
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,653
REMEMBER,
DRINK RESPONSIBLY.

443
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:30,529
[applause]

444
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:38,770
OH, HI, EVERYBODY.
RANGER GORD HERE.

445
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,239
WELL, IT'S THE
BIG NIGHT, ISN'T IT?

446
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:43,175
NEW YEAR'S EVE,
WOOHOO.

447
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,011
YOU KNOW, FOREST RANGERS
DON'T HAVE BIG NIGHTS.

448
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,380
WE HAVE LONG NIGHTS,

449
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,316
LONG, COLD, LONELY NIGHTS,
WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN
A COLD SWEAT

450
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,086
WITH YOUR LIPS WRAPPED AROUND
A CAN OF CREAMED CORN.

451
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,121
[shudders]

452
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,290
YOU KNOW, I THINK THE CAPTAIN
AND TENILLE SAY IT BEST

453
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:01,326
IN THEIR BRAND NEW HIT,
"MUSKRAT LOVE."

454
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:04,730
BETCHA A FOREST RANGER
WROTE "MUSKRAT LOVE."

455
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:10,402
ANYWAY, IT'S A
NIGHT OF CELEBRATION,

456
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:13,672
AND FOR THAT I'VE CREATED THIS
BRAND NEW ANIMATED FILM FOR
YOUR AMAZEMENT.

457
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,508
IT'S ALL ABOUT NEW YEAR'S
EVE IN THE FOREST.

458
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,778
BUT I'VE CALLED IT
"FOREST NEW YEAR'S."

459
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,747
GET IT?

460
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:24,516
HERE WE GO.

461
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:43,068
[quirky upbeat music]

462
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,205
TODAY I'M GOING TO TEACH
EVERYONE IN THE UNIVERSE

463
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:50,142
THE TRADITION OF
A FOREST NEW YEAR'S.

464
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,111
AND I CAN HARDLY
CONTAIN MY EXCITEMENT.

465
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,847
WELL, YOU HAVE A
PRETTY SMALL CONTAINER.

466
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,517
I'M ANXIOUS TO LEARN
ANY BIT OF LORE

467
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,919
CONCERNING THE FOREST
AND ITS MANY TRADITIONS.

468
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,522
GOOD BOY, HAROLD.

469
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:06,958
THE FOREST NEW YEAR STATES
THAT IN ORDER TO HAVE
A HAPPY NEW YEAR,

470
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,795
YOU HAVE TO HURL A
LUCKY ROCK OVER THE MOON

471
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:12,631
AND ACROSS THE RIVER
BEFORE THE STROKE
OF MIDNIGHT.

472
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:15,000
I'VE NEVER HEARD
OF SUCH A THING.

473
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:18,070
I'M FAMILIAR WITH
HURLING BEFORE MIDNIGHT.

474
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,072
YOU TWO GRAB
THAT LUCKY ROCK

475
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,640
AND BRING IT DOWN
TO THE RIVER.

476
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,308
IT'S THE ONE
ON THE LEFT.

477
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:34,753
OH, MY MISTAKE.

478
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,021
IT'S THE ONE
ON THE RIGHT.

479
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,259
[grunting]

480
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:44,663
ALMOST THERE.

481
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:49,534
TO TOSS THE ROCK, WE'RE GOING
TO USE NATURE'S OWN CATAPULT,

482
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,536
THE PINE TREE.

483
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:53,772
THAT'S A
MAPLE TREE, GORD.

484
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:57,776
OH -- OH, WELL, IT ACTUALLY
DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFF --

485
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,079
OW.

486
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,217
OH, THERE'S A PINE
TREE THERE.

487
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:06,585
RIGHT THERE.

488
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:13,859
LET ME GIVE YOU
HAND THERE, HAROLD.

489
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:21,700
OKAY, STICK THE LUCKY
ROCK ON THERE, RED.

490
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,236
YOU KNOW, I THINK THE
LUCK MAY HAVE WORN OFF

491
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,405
THIS PARTICULAR ROCK.

492
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,306
I'LL GIVE
YOU A HAND!

493
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,743
[screaming]

494
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:40,952
WE DID IT!

495
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:43,255
IT'S GOING TO BE
A HAPPY NEW YEAR!

496
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,257
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE HAROLD'S
GOING TO MISS THE FIRST
FEW WEEKS OF IT,

497
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,225
SO I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

498
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,730
HA! HA! HA!

499
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:55,000
[quirky upbeat music]

500
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,005
[applause]

501
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,474
HAPPY NEW YEAR.

502
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:05,343
MAY YOUR SEPTICS NEVER
CAUSE YOU A TEAR.

503
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,878
MAY THEY HANDLE
YOUR CHILI BEANS,

504
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,647
BRATWURST AND BEER.

505
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:11,483
MAY YOUR TANK RUN ON EMPTY
THROUGHOUT THE NEW YEAR.

506
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,285
BUT IF NOT,
MY PUMP AND MY HOSE

507
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:14,853
ARE RIGHT HERE.

508
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:21,560
WELL THEN, I GUESS
THE TIME HAS COME

509
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,896
FOR ME TO MAKE MY
NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION.

510
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:29,201
I'VE DECIDED TO BE A LOT
MORE SPECIFIC THIS YEAR.

511
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:32,370
USUALLY I PROMISE
MYSELF SOMETHING LIKE,

512
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:35,407
I'M GOING TO LOSE WEIGHT
OR START MY OWN BUSINESS

513
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:39,411
OR HAVE A CONVERSATION
WITH MY PARENTS.

514
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,881
BUT THIS YEAR I'VE DECIDED TO
ZERO RIGHT IN ON THE PROBLEM.

515
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:48,053
I SOLEMNLY SWEAR BEFORE
ALL OF THESE WITNESSES

516
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:50,589
THAT FOR THE NEXT YEAR,
AND POSSIBLY LONGER,

517
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,525
I WILL NOT EAT
PEANUT BUTTER SANDWICHES.

518
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:55,527
PERIOD.

519
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,963
REGARDLESS OF
THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

520
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:00,432
EVEN IN THE CASE
OF AN EMERGENCY.

521
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:03,168
THIS IS BECAUSE PEANUT BUTTER
HAS A WAY OF STICKING

522
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,238
TO THE ROOF OF
A PERSON'S MOUTH.

523
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,240
THAT CAN BE DISTRACTING

524
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,344
AND CAN ALSO IMPEDE THEIR
ABILITY TO CALL FOR HELP

525
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,980
WHEN THEY SO
DESPERATELY NEED IT.

526
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:24,189
NOW, THIS MAY SOUND
LIKE AN ODD NEW YEAR'S
RESOLUTION TO YOU,

527
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:27,826
BUT YOU'RE NOT AN ANIMAL
CONTROL OFFICER, ARE YOU?

528
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:30,262
NO, YOU COULD PROBABLY SPEND
MOST OF YOUR DAY

529
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:34,933
SITTING AT YOUR DESK, DRINKING
COFFEE OR DOING WHATEVER
WAS NECESSARY

530
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,569
TO GET THE PEANUT BUTTER OFF
OF THE ROOF OF YOUR MOUTH!

531
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,673
WELL, WHOOP-DE-FREAKING-DO!

532
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:47,746
I DON'T HAVE THAT LUXURY.
I DON'T WORK IN AN OFFICE.

533
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,681
I WORK IN THE WOODS.

534
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:52,217
I WORK IN THE
WOODS WITH ELK.

535
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:54,119
ELK HAVE HORNS,

536
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,187
EYE-LEVEL HORNS.

537
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:05,931
AND SO THAT IS WHY I PROMISE

538
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:08,967
TO NEVER EAT ANOTHER
PEANUT BUTTER SANDWICH AGAIN.

539
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,502
EVER.

540
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,870
HAPPY NEW YEAR.

541
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:16,875
[applause]

542
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,878
Red: NOW, FOR NEW YEAR'S WE
THOUGHT WE'D DO OUR VERSION

543
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:22,080
OF THE TIME SQUARE DROPPING
THE BALL AT MIDNIGHT.

544
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:23,982
AND MIKE WAS MAKING
SOME KIND OF PUNCH THERE.

545
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,084
HE'S REALLY SOCKING
THE BOOZE INTO HER.

546
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:27,719
BUT I HAD WINSTON FILLING
THE OIL DRUM WITH WATER.

547
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,421
THAT WAS GOING TO BE THE
COUNTERWEIGHT.

548
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:30,889
WHOA, EASY, EASY, EASY.

549
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:33,091
HOLY COW. MY GOLLY.

550
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:37,162
NOBODY'S GONNA TRY THAT
WITHOUT HOSPITAL INSURANCE.

551
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:38,997
SO ANYWAY, I'M GETTIN'
THE BALL UP THERE.

552
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,131
WE JUST HOIST HER UP.

553
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:43,702
THEN WHAT I DO IS TIE THAT
ONTO THE OIL DRUM
FULL OF WATER.

554
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,904
AND THE WAY IT WORKS, AS I
WAS EXPLAINING TO THE GUYS,

555
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:48,640
WHAT WE DO IS LET THE WATER
SLOWLY OUTTA THE OIL DRUM,

556
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,575
AND THEN THE MIRROR
BALL WILL COME DOWN.

557
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,110
SO IT'S A VERY
SIMPLE PRINCIPLE.

558
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:53,345
DO YOU GUYS --
YOU GUYS --

559
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:54,579
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKIN' --

560
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:55,981
NOTHING, NOT A THING.

561
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:58,583
ALL RIGHT, SO I SAY,
I'LL TAKE THAT CORK OUT,

562
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,918
AND THE WATER
GOES OUT AND --

563
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,219
DO YOU GET IT NOW?

564
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,355
NOTHING. NOTHING.
NOT A PULSE THERE.

565
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,923
SO I THOUGHT, WELL,
I'LL JUST DEMONSTRATE.

566
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,292
SO AS THE WATER GOES OUT,
SEE, THAT GOES UP,

567
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,927
AND THE BALL
STARTS COMING DOWN.

568
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,462
OF COURSE, WE'RE GONNA
DO THIS AT MIDNIGHT.

569
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:11,863
BUT ACTUALLY IT WAS
GOOD WE DID A TRIAL RUN,

570
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,732
BECAUSE WE GOT A PROBLEM.

571
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,467
SHE JAMMED INTO THE PULLEY,
AND NOW I CAN'T GET IT DOWN;

572
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,202
I CAN'T GET IT UP.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

573
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,037
NOW WE GOTTA GET IT
OUTTA THE PULLEY THERE.

574
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:21,606
SO WALTER HAD THE IDEA
MAYBE HE COULD GET A LADDER,

575
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:24,843
BUT THERE'S NOTHING, REALLY,
TO PUT A LADDER AGAINST.

576
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:26,978
GET RID OF THE
LADDER, WALTER.

577
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,847
FORGET THE LADDER.
FORGET THE LADDER.

578
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:31,049
THE OTHER GUYS, MEANWHILE,
HAD GOT THE HELIUM BALLOONS.

579
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:33,585
WALTER'S ONLY
ABOUT 130 POUNDS,

580
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:36,054
AND WITH ABOUT 10 --
10 OR 15, YOU KNOW,

581
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:38,857
YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET -- WELL,
ANYWAY, THAT'S A GOOD --

582
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:41,760
YOU KNOW, IN RETROSPECT,
HE PROBABLY SHOULD'VE
HUNG ONTO THE POLE.

583
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,962
'CAUSE THAT WOULD'VE
KEPT HIM --

584
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,131
'CAUSE AS HE GOT UP THERE,
THERE WAS A BIT OF
A CROSS WIND,

585
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:49,534
AND HE'S, UH, KINDA
GETTING AWAY FROM --

586
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:52,137
SO, OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
NO, HERE'S WHAT WE DO.

587
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,706
HERE'S WHAT WE DO: IF CAN
GET HIM TO GRAB THE END
OF THE LADDER,

588
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:57,075
WE CAN PULL HIM
OVER TO THE POLE.

589
00:27:57,108 --> 00:28:00,445
SO WE HOLD THE LADDER.
GRAB THE END, WALTER.

590
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,180
SO ANOTHER GUST
OF WIND COMES.

591
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,783
NOW HE'S PULLING US!
GOING THE OTHER WAY.

592
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,419
WE DIDN'T SEE THE
POWER WIRE THERE.

593
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:09,888
AND HE'S HANGING ON THERE.

594
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:11,256
AND THEN IT HITS
THE PUNCH BOWL,

595
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:14,359
AND OH, BOY.

596
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,194
SO NOW WE GOTTA GET --

597
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:17,996
I FIGURE IF WE CAN JUST
BREAK ONE BALLOON
WITH A ROCK --

598
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,731
OR MAYBE TWO
OR THREE BALLOONS.

599
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,633
SO I FIRE A ROCK.
I GOT ONE.

600
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,436
OKAY, JUST BREAK
A COUPLE MORE.

601
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:27,806
DON'T KNOW QUITE
WHAT DALTON HAD IN MIND.

602
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:32,110
YOU KNOW, BETTER NOT
TO ASK SOMETIMES.

603
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:33,278
I THINK THE SHIRT
SAYS IT ALL.

604
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,880
OH, PITCHFORK,
THAT'S MAYBE NOT --

605
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:38,450
MAYBE NOT THE BEST IDEA.

606
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,385
OH, OH.

607
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:41,920
OH!

608
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,789
OH, OH, OH.
OH, MY GOSH.

609
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:47,759
WELL, HERE COMES THE BALL!

610
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:50,395
OKAY, I GUESS
IT'S MIDNIGHT SOMEWHERE,

611
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:52,230
SO HAPPY NEW YEAR.

612
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:58,670
[applause]

613
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:05,477
YOU KNOW, IT'S GREAT TO
HAVE A NEW YEAR'S PARTY,

614
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,679
WHERE YOUR FRIENDS
CAN ENJOY THEMSELVES,

615
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,148
BUT THE LAST THING YOU WANT
IS SOMEBODY TRYING TO
DRIVE A CAR

616
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:12,283
AFTER THEY'VE
BEEN OVER SERVED.

617
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,985
SO HERE'S WHAT YOU DO...

618
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:17,155
STACK A BUNCH OF DEAD SOLDIERS
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM.

619
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:20,158
THEN LAY AN EMPTY
PIZZA BOX ON TOP.

620
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:22,227
THAT'S GONNA BE A STEP STOOL
THAT YOUR FRIENDS CAN USE

621
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:25,430
TO RETRIEVE THEIR CAR KEYS
BEFORE THEY DRIVE HOME.

622
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,165
AND THE REASON THEY
NEED A STEP STOOL,

623
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,000
IS THAT WHEN THEY
ARRIVED AT THE PARTY

624
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:32,804
YOU TOOK THEIR KEYS AND HUNG
THEM FROM THIS CEILING FAN.

625
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:34,639
NOW, EACH OF YOUR GUESTS
HAS TO BE SOBER ENOUGH

626
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:38,276
TO BALANCE ON THE STOOL,
OR THEY DON'T GET THEIR KEYS.

627
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,311
AND TO MAKE IT
A BETTER TEST,

628
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:43,014
I'VE WIRED THE FAN
INTO A MOTION DETECTOR

629
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,483
SO THAT AS THEY
APPROACH THE UNIT,

630
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,786
IT GETS A LITTLE TRICKIER
TO GRAB THEIR KEYS.

631
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:54,125
OUCH!

632
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,929
[applause]

633
00:29:58,096 --> 00:29:59,364
I NEED A DRINK.

634
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,268
UNCLE RED, CAN I TALK
TO YOU A MINUTE?

635
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,969
I WAS JUST WORKING
ON MY NEW YEAR'S
RESOLUTIONS,

636
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:06,971
AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE A GOOD IDEA TO
GET SOME INPUT

637
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:08,673
FROM SOMEONE I SPEND
A LOT OF TIME WITH

638
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,942
TO MAKE SURE I'M MAKING
WORTHWHILE CHANGES.

639
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,544
WELL, I THINK THAT'S
A GREAT IDEA, HAROLD.

640
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,479
OH, OKAY, GOOD.
GREAT.

641
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,648
IS THERE ANOTHER CHAIR
AROUND THAT I COULD USE?

642
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,650
I GOT A
FOOTSTOOL HERE.

643
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:20,251
OKAY, THAT'D
BE GREAT.

644
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,853
OKAY, SO --

645
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:27,826
THANK YOU.

646
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,360
WELL, I HAVE MY
LIST OUT.

647
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,329
PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE
TO TAKE YOURS OUT.

648
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:33,665
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

649
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:35,733
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I WAS JUST SAYIN'

650
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,902
WHEN TWO PEOPLE SPEND A LOT
OF TIME WITH EACH OTHER,

651
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,938
YOU KNOW, NEW YEAR'S IS
PROBABLY A REALLY GOOD TIME

652
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,673
THAT THEY COULD SIT
DOWN AND FIGURE OUT

653
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:43,208
HOW TO MAKE THE
RELATIONSHIP BETTER.

654
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:44,742
YEAH, NO,
I AGREE WITH YOU.

655
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,277
SO WHY DON'T YOU GO THROUGH
THE CHANGES YOU'RE GONNA MAKE,

656
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,680
'CAUSE I CAN REALLY HELP
YOU OUT THERE.

657
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:50,915
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

658
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:52,383
WE'LL START
WITH MINE THEN.

659
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:56,087
WELL, I RESOLVE
TO LIMIT HOW MUCH I
TALK ABOUT COMPUTERS;

660
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:57,889
HOW LONG I'M ON
THE INTERNET;

661
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:00,725
FIND A GIRLFRIEND;

662
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:04,128
AND TO ONCE AGAIN
NOT TO TAKE UP SMOKING.

663
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:06,097
OKAY, THAT'S GOOD, BUT YOU
KNOW WHAT ELSE, HAROLD?

664
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:07,565
YOU SHOULDN'T GIVE YOUR
OPINION ALL THE TIME.

665
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:10,368
I FIND THAT
ANNOYING.

666
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,103
THAT'S NOT A
VALID CRITICISM.

667
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,771
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT RIGHT THERE.

668
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:15,506
WELL, THAT'S --

669
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:19,978
THAT'S FOOD
FOR THOUGHT.

670
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,479
OKAY.
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

671
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:23,014
SO ALRIGHTY,
THAT'S MY LIST.

672
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:24,415
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE YOURS
OUT AND READ FROM YOURS?

673
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:27,252
NO, ACTUALLY, I'M NOT MAKING
ANY RESOLUTIONS THIS YEAR.

674
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:34,492
NO?

675
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,427
WELL, EVERY YEAR
I MAKE RESOLUTIONS,

676
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:39,163
AND THEN I BREAK THEM ONE BY
ONE BEFORE THE YEAR IS GONE.

677
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:41,766
YOU BREAK 'EM ONE BY ONE
BEFORE THE HANGOVER'S GONE.

678
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,304
I'VE KINDA HIT THE GLASS
CEILING, HAROLD.

679
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:48,172
THIS IS ABOUT AS
GOOD AS I'M GONNA GET,

680
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:50,441
AND I'M GONNA STOP
FIGHTING IT, REALLY.

681
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,811
THIS IS AS GOOD
AS YOU GET?

682
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:56,114
YEAH.
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

683
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:58,149
NO, I'M JUST TRYING
TO GRASP THE CONCEPT

684
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:00,818
OF YOU BEING SATISFIED WITH
THAT LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE.

685
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:04,923
GEE, I SURE HOPE I HAVEN'T
UPSET YOU, HAROLD.

686
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:06,758
OH, NO.
NO, NO, NO.

687
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:08,593
YOU KNOW, MOST MEN MY
AGE WOULD BE INTIMIDATED

688
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,728
BY THE PROFICIENCY AND
ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF
THEIR ELDERS,

689
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,264
BUT ACTUALLY,
YOU SPARED ME ALL THAT.

690
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,872
YOUR WIFE'S ALL READY
FOR NEW YEAR'S.

691
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,641
SHE'S GOT HER NEW DRESS,
HER NEW HAIRDO

692
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:28,146
AND HER NEW QUEEN SIZE,
CONTROL TOP PANTYHOSE.

693
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:30,214
NOW, YOU'RE ABOUT
TO BREAK IT TO HER.

694
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:32,717
YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE
GOING OUT THIS NEW YEAR'S.

695
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,586
NOW, FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY,
TRY AND LET HER DOWN EASY.

696
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:38,756
IT'S NO POINT IN POINTING OUT
WHAT A GOOD SPORT YOU WERE

697
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:41,192
BY GOING TO ALL THOSE
CHRISTMAS PARTIES WITH HER.

698
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,927
NO, ESPECIALLY WHEN
YOU GOT CAUGHT

699
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:46,297
LYING ON THE COATS IN THE
BEDROOM READING FISHING
MAGAZINES.

700
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:48,566
IT'S GONNA BE PRETTY
DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN TO HER

701
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:51,569
THAT YOU'D RATHER STAY
HOME WITH YOUR FAVOURITE

702
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:55,306
FUNNY SPORTS
BLOOPERS VIDEOS.

703
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,709
YEAH, YEAH, YOU MIGHT
WANNA DO A 180 ON THAT.

704
00:32:57,775 --> 00:33:00,378
YEAH, LIKE CHANGING
YOUR MIND, SUCKING IT UP

705
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:02,213
AND GOING TO
THE PARTY AFTER ALL.

706
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,015
YEAH, THINK ABOUT
IT THIS WAY...

707
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:06,451
IF SHE'S HAVING FUN
AND YOU'RE NOT,

708
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:08,353
YOU'RE STILL HAVING WAY
MORE FUN THAN YOU WOULD BE

709
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:11,723
WHEN YOU'RE HAVING
FUN AND SHE'S NOT!

710
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:14,392
AND JUST REMEMBER,

711
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:17,528
NEW YEAR'S EVE IS JUST
ONE COLD NIGHT IN JANUARY,

712
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:21,065
BUT THE GARAGE IS
COLD 24/7, 365.

713
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,402
THINK ABOUT IT.

714
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:26,004
WE KNOW YOU'LL
DO THE RIGHT THING.

715
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:27,372
OR AT LEAST
THE SAFE THING.

716
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:28,940
HAPPY NEW YEAR!
HAPPY NEW YEAR!

717
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,242
[applause]

718
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:42,587
OH, YEAH.
UH --

719
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:45,289
OKAY, MY NEW YEAR'S
RESOLUTIONS.

720
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:47,792
YEAH, I GOT SOME.

721
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:49,727
SETTING GOALS AND
WORKING TOWARDS 'EM

722
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:52,630
IS A BIG PART OF MY
REHABILITATION PROGRAMME.

723
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:00,138
OKAY... BURGLAR ALARMS.

724
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:02,340
I'D LIKE TO SEE
THEM OUTLAWED.

725
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,843
IF WE CAN'T LIVE TOGETHER IN
AN ATMOSPHERE OF MUTUAL TRUST,

726
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,880
THEN WHAT KIND OF
A SOCIETY IS THIS?

727
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:12,850
TO ME, IT IS SO INSULTING WHEN
THAT BURGLAR ALARM GOES OFF,

728
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:15,119
AND YOU SUDDENLY REALISE,
QUITE INNOCENTLY,

729
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:18,056
THAT YOU'RE NOT
IN YOUR OWN HOME.

730
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:20,324
AND THE SAME GOES
FOR PETTY THEFT TOO.

731
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,995
LIKE, I'D LIKE TO SEE PETTY
THEFT TREATED LIKE A
DRIVING OFFENCE.

732
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,197
THE FIRST TIME
YOU STEAL SOMETHING,

733
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:28,666
YOU GET OFF WITH A WARNING.

734
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,768
AND I GOT A POINT
SYSTEM TOO.

735
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:33,738
A WALLET IS
WORTH ONE POINT,

736
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:37,208
AND A PIANO IS, LIKE,
FIVE POINTS.

737
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,043
AND ONCE YOU LOSE
ALL YOUR POINTS,

738
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,279
THEN YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO
STEAL ANYTHING FOR A YEAR.

739
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:43,281
WHICH IS KIND OF LIKE
HOW JAIL WORKS NOW.

740
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:46,150
ONLY UNDER MY SYSTEM,
YOU'D BE FORCED TO GET A JOB

741
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:49,087
AND MAKE YOUR OWN WAY,
RATHER THAN BE INCARCERATED,

742
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,356
WHERE EVERYTHING
IS PAID FOR.

743
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,792
WELL, ANYWAY,
THAT'S ABOUT IT,

744
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:57,495
UM, EXCEPT THAT,
WELL, YOU KNOW,

745
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,997
NEW YEAR'S IS A TIME
FOR FORGIVENESS.

746
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:02,300
AND IF YOU'RE
PREPARED TO FORGIVE,

747
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:05,436
THEN I'M CERTAINLY PREPARED
TO ACCEPT THAT APOLOGY.

748
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:07,071
HAPPY NEW YEAR.

749
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,740
[applause]

750
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,543
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE
TO COMMEMORATE NEW YEAR'S EVE

751
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:15,713
BY HAVING SOME SORT OF
AUDIO/VISUAL PRESENTATION
IN THEIR BACKYARD,

752
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,483
MAYBE FIRECRACKERS
OR A LIGHT SHOW.

753
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,985
IT'S THEIR WAY OF CELEBRATING
THE BEGINNING OF A NEW YEAR

754
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,653
AND ALSO SURPRISING
THE NEIGHBOURS

755
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,655
THAT THEY ACTUALLY
KNOW WHAT DAY IT IS.

756
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,190
NOW, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING...

757
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:28,326
"WHERE ARE YOU GONNA
FIND THE MONEY TO DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?"

758
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:30,995
OR, "MY WIFE WON'T LET ME
HAVE FIRECRACKERS."

759
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:32,830
OR, "WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, RED?"

760
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,232
WELL, TAKE IT EASY.

761
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:36,634
WITH MY IDEA YOU DON'T NEED
MONEY OR FIREWORKS.

762
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,703
ALL YOU NEED
IS A TOASTER --

763
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:40,872
WELL, ACTUALLY,
A FEW TOASTERS.

764
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:57,021
THAT IT?

765
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,561
AND WE DON'T EVEN
NEED THE WHOLE TOASTER,

766
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:05,329
JUST THE ELEMENTS
FROM INSIDE.

767
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,031
I MEAN, THEY'RE
PERFECT FOR OUR DISPLAY,

768
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:08,299
BECAUSE YOU CAN
BEND 'EM INTO SHAPES,

769
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:10,301
AND THEY GLOW WHEN
THEY'RE HOT.

770
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,403
DON'T YOU WISH MORE THINGS
IN LIFE WERE THAT SIMPLE?

771
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:41,566
BOY, I'M EXHAUSTED.
THAT WAS A LOT OF SWEARING.

772
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:43,768
OKAY, NOW WE GOT
THE EASY PART.

773
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:45,803
WE JUST FORM THE
ELEMENTS INTO THE LETTERS

774
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:47,305
FOR OUR NEW YEAR'S
EVE SIGN, SEE?

775
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,407
THIS HERE IS
THE LETTER "T."

776
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:52,710
TODAY'S HANDYMAN CORNER
IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY
THE LETTER "T."

777
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:54,745
OR IF IT DOESN'T WORK,
IT'LL BE THE LETTER "B,"

778
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:56,180
'CAUSE IF SHE
DOESN'T WORK,

779
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:58,449
LET 'ER BE.

780
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:01,185
OKAY, NOW WE JUST FORM
THE REST OF THE LETTERS

781
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:03,354
AND THEN JOIN ALL
THE ELEMENTS TOGETHER

782
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:05,256
MAKING A SIGN THAT'S
NOT ONLY BRIGHT,

783
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,158
BUT ALSO TOASTY WARM.

784
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,729
OKAY, OUR SIGN'S
ALL DONE.

785
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:13,965
I'VE GOT THE ELEMENTS
HOOKED UP TO THESE WIRES.

786
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,235
AND THEN TO SUPPLY
THE ELECTRICITY,

787
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,736
I'VE GOT THE OTHER END HOOKED
INTO THE POWER SUPPLY

788
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,238
ON ONE OF MY TOASTERS.

789
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,139
NOW WHEN I PUSH DOWN
THIS LITTLE LEVER,

790
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:24,175
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN
IMPRESSIVE DISPLAY.

791
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:26,110
BUT I'VE GOTTA
WAIT FOR NIGHT,

792
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:27,912
'CAUSE I'VE GOT THE
CONTROL SET ON DARK.

793
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:32,383
OKAY, WE'RE ALL SET.

794
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,552
SO LET'S SEND OUR
LIT NEW YEAR'S MESSAGE

795
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,387
OUT TO THE WORLD.

796
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:47,031
JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING FROM
ALL OF US TO EACH OF YOU.

797
00:37:55,172 --> 00:38:03,781
[cheers and applause]

798
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,188
I WANNA TALK TO ALL
YOU MIDDLE-AGED GUYS

799
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:13,457
WHO ARE OUT CELEBRATING
NEW YEAR'S THIS YEAR.

800
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,795
YOU KNOW, IT'S NEVER TOO SOON
TO START THINKING ABOUT
THE MIDNIGHT KISS.

801
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:21,299
YOU DON'T WANNA SCREW IT UP
AGAIN, NOW, DO YOU?

802
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,868
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
TO REMEMBER, REALLY...

803
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:26,270
KISS YOUR WIFE FIRST.

804
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,975
EXCUSES WON'T WORK,

805
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:34,345
LIKE, "I THOUGHT I WAS
KISSING YOU."

806
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,748
"I TRIED TO, BUT SOMEONE
ELSE'S LIPS GOT IN THE WAY."

807
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,618
OR WORSE STILL, "AH, COME ON,
HONEY, IT'S NEW YEAR'S.

808
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:42,853
"I'M SUPPOSED TO
BE HAVING FUN."

809
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,625
OKAY, MAINLY, YOU'VE GOTTA BE
ABLE TO FIND YOUR WIFE
AT MIDNIGHT.

810
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:51,062
THAT MEANS YOU REALLY
WANNA STAY SOBER, OKAY?

811
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:54,532
IF YOU CAN'T SEE, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA BE ABLE TO FIND HER.

812
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:58,269
AND BRAILLE
IS NOT AN OPTION.

813
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:01,772
AND WHEN YOU DO FIND HER,
AND YOU ARE KISSING YOUR
OWN BEAUTY QUEEN,

814
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,077
DON'T BE TRYING
TO MAKE EYE CONTACT
WITH MISS CONGENIALITY.

815
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,280
HAVING A SPLIT FOCUS
AT THAT CRUCIAL MOMENT

816
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,315
CAN LEAD TO
OTHER SPLITS...

817
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:12,917
SPLIT LIPS,
SPLITTING HEADACHE,

818
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:15,186
SPLITTING WIFE.

819
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:17,154
AND DON'T BE USING
NEW YEAR'S AS A WAY

820
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:19,490
TO HOOK UP WITH SOME OF
YOUR EX-GIRLFRIENDS.

821
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,225
SHOULD OLD
ACQUAINTANCE BE FORGOT?

822
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:23,094
ABSOLUTELY.

823
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,129
ESPECIALLY IF SHE'S
ATTRACTIVE, SHE'S AT THE PARTY

824
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,231
AND SHE'S CARRYING AROUND A
PICTURE OF A 12-YEAR-OLD BOY

825
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:30,201
WHO LOOKS
EXACTLY LIKE YOU.

826
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,570
SO JUST COOL IT.
HAVE A HAPPY NEW YEAR.

827
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:34,839
AND REMEMBER,
I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

828
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:36,774
WE'RE ALL IN
THIS TOGETHER.

829
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:40,044
[applause]

830
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:43,013
YOU KNOW WHAT?

831
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,983
I AM A FIRM BELIEVER IN
THE NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION.

832
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:48,686
OH, I KNOW A LOT OF
PEOPLE POOH-POOH IT.

833
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:53,324
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
TO ME THERE'S ALWAYS
ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT.

834
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:57,194
SO FIRST OF ALL...

835
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:01,098
ANN MARIE, MY WIFE,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

836
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:04,335
YOU COULD BE A
LITTLE MORE TOLERANT

837
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,471
AND MAYBE JUST A LITTLE LESS
CRITICAL OF MY WARDROBE,

838
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:10,875
AND MAYBE JUST A LITTLE
FRIENDLIER IN THE ROMANCE
DEPARTMENT, HONEY,

839
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:12,743
YOU KNOW, IF YOU
GET MY DRIFT.

840
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,947
NOW, AS FOR MY
DAUGHTER MANDY,

841
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,150
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH YOUR LIFESTYLE

842
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:22,887
THAT A NEW BOYFRIEND,
ACCEPTABLE MORALS

843
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,558
AND MAYBE SOME GAINFUL
EMPLOYMENT WOULDN'T SOLVE.

844
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,727
OKAY, AND THIS LAST ONE...

845
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:32,263
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO
COME INTO MY STORE,

846
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:36,467
THE WORD "CUSTOMER" IMPLIES
A BUSINESS TRANSACTION

847
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,536
WHERE I SELL YOU
SOMETHING, RIGHT?

848
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:42,540
SO THIS YEAR, LET'S KEEP
THAT TRADITION ALIVE.

849
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,875
YOU KNOW, THE CUSTOMER'S
ALWAYS RIGHT,

850
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:48,679
BUT THE BROWSER'S
ALWAYS A PAIN IN THE BUTT.

851
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,915
HAPPY NEW YEAR.

852
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:53,117
[applause]

853
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:57,188
THIS IS THE REPAIR SHOP
PART OF OUR SPECIAL

854
00:40:57,188 --> 00:41:00,024
WE CALL, IF IT AIN'T BROKE,
YOU'RE NOT TRYING.

855
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:01,826
SO WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
FOR US HERE, MIKE?

856
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,862
THIS IS AN INFLATABLE
CHAIR, MR. GREEN.

857
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:07,031
RUEFULLY, IT HAS
SEVERAL HOLES IN IT

858
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:10,334
DUE TO AN UNFORTUNATE
MISUNDERSTANDING.

859
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:13,904
I NOTICE THIS IS FROM
THE SHADY ACRES REST HOME.

860
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:17,007
UH, THAT'S CORRECT.
I BORROWED IT.

861
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,510
DID YOU TELL THEM YOU
WERE BORROWING IT?

862
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:21,245
WELL, I MAY HAVE,

863
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:23,948
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
OLD FOLKS ARE LIKE.

864
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:27,151
HOW COME IT'S GOT
ALL THE HOLES IN IT?

865
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:31,055
WELL, ONE OF THE RESIDENTS
HAD A PELLET GUN.

866
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:34,625
WELL, I CAN FIX THE HOLES
WITH THE HANDYMAN'S
SECRET WEAPON,

867
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,026
BUT THERE'S NO
REAL HURRY.

868
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:37,895
IT'S GONNA BE SEVERAL
MONTHS BEFORE YOU GET
INTO THE POOL.

869
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:41,232
I NEED IT NOW, RED,
'CAUSE I WANNA MAKE IT FLY.

870
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:43,133
YOU SEE, IF YOU CAN
PATCH UP THE HOLES IN IT

871
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,035
AND PUT SOME KIND OF
A GAS IN IT,

872
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:46,871
THEN I'LL HAVE
MYSELF A BLIMP.

873
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:49,340
DO YOU THINK
HYDROGEN WOULD WORK?

874
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:52,042
UH, YEAH.
THAT'D BE A
NON-SMOKING FLIGHT.

875
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:57,515
SO WHERE ARE YOU PLANNING
TO GO IN THE CHAIR

876
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:58,949
ONCE YOU
GET IT FLYING?

877
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,718
OH, YEAH.
AROUND THE WORLD.

878
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:03,220
YOU SEE, I WANNA MAKE UP
FOR ALL THE NEW YEAR'S EVES

879
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:05,523
THAT I MISSED OUT ON
WHEN I WAS IN THE SLAMMER.

880
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:08,826
NOW, THE EARTH HAS 24
DIFFERENT TIME ZONES,

881
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:12,096
AND I WANNA CELEBRATE
NEW YEAR'S IN EACH AND
EVERY ONE OF 'EM.

882
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:14,632
OKAY, I UNDERSTAND HOW THE
CHAIR'S GONNA GET UP
IN THE AIR,

883
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:16,133
BUT WHAT'S GONNA
MAKE IT FLY?

884
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,401
NOTHING.

885
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:19,670
THAT'S THE BEAUTY
OF A ROTATING EARTH.

886
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:22,172
YOU SEE, IT'LL JUST
SPIN BY UNDERNEATH ME,

887
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:25,342
AND I'LL JUST DROP
DOWN IN EVERY TIME ZONE.

888
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:27,011
I'LL HAVE MYSELF
A QUICK BEER

889
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,179
AND KISS SOMEBODY'S WIFE.

890
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:32,950
OKAY, MIKE, THERE'S TWO
PROBLEMS WITH YOUR PLAN...

891
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:35,686
IT WON'T WORK
AND YOU'LL DIE.

892
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,888
SO FORGET ABOUT
THE CHAIR.

893
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:39,523
GO UP TO THE
AIRPORT BAR,

894
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,158
YOU KNOW,
BY PORT ASBESTOS THERE?

895
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:42,927
THEY'VE GOT
ALL THE CLOCKS FROM
EVERYWHERE AROUND THE WORLD,

896
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:44,628
AND EVERY TIME ONE
OF THEM HITS MIDNIGHT,

897
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:46,397
HAVE YOURSELF A
GLASS OF BUBBLY.

898
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,465
OH, OKAY, THAT MIGHT
BE KINDA FUN,

899
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:50,968
BUT I'D LIKE SOMEONE
TO GO ALONG WITH ME.

900
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:53,137
WELL, TAKE ONE OF
THE GUYS FROM SHADY ACRES.

901
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:55,639
I MEAN, I FIND OLD PEOPLE
REALLY ENJOY CELEBRATING
NEW YEAR'S.

902
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:58,909
THEY'RE SO SHOCKED
THAT THEY MADE IT.

903
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:03,213
I DUNNO IF I WANNA SPEND
NEW YEAR'S WITH A BORING
OLD SENIOR CITIZEN.

904
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,215
WELL, TAKE THE GUY
WITH THE PELLET GUN.

905
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,451
HE KNOWS HOW TO PARTY.

906
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:10,588
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA!

907
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:13,290
YOU KNOW, THE ONLY
SAD PART IS THAT

908
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:16,360
I WON'T BE ABLE TO SPEND ANY
TIME WITH ALL MY BUDDIES.

909
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:18,629
THEY'RE ALL
STILL IN JAIL.

910
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:21,498
WELL, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE
GONNA BE AT A 24-HOUR BAR

911
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:24,301
AND YOUR DRINKING PARTNER
IS AN ARMED SENIOR,

912
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:26,070
I THINK THE CHANCES OF
YOU AND YOUR JAIL BUDDIES

913
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,572
GETTING BACK TOGETHER
IS REAL GOOD.

914
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:30,007
GREAT!

915
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:30,808
YEAH, AWAY YOU GO.

916
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:33,811
[applause]

917
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:35,713
WELL, THAT'S IT FOR
OUR NEW YEAR'S SPECIAL.

918
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:37,147
WE HOPE YOU ENJOYED IT.

919
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:38,616
T IF YOU DID HAPPEN TO
FALL ASLEEP ON THE COUCH,

920
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:40,284
WELL, THAT'S GOOD TOO,

921
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:42,586
BECAUSE NOW YOU'LL BE
ABLE TO STAY AWAKE
UNTIL MIDNIGHT.

922
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:44,555
AND FOR ALL YOU
YOUNGER PEOPLE OUT THERE,

923
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:46,357
WE WISH YOU THE
BEST NEW YEAR'S EVER,

924
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,859
AND WE HOPE THE NEXT YEAR'S
JUST AS SAFE AND HAPPY TOO.

925
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:51,362
YEAH, AND FOR YOU
OLDER GUYS OUT THERE,

926
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:53,197
LET'S HOPE WE CAN ALL SURVIVE
ANY HAREBRAINED THING

927
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:56,433
THE YOUNG PEOPLE THROW AT US
OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

928
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,102
OH, UNCLE RED,
THAT REMINDS ME.

929
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,137
I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR
ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES
YOU'VE GIVEN ME

930
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:02,072
FOR PERSONAL GROWTH
AND FOR PROFESSIONAL
DEVELOPMENT

931
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:03,607
OVER THE PAST YEARS.

932
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:06,243
AND I HOPE WE GET
TO SPEND MANY, MANY
MORE YEARS TOGETHER.

933
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,713
HOW MANY MORE?

934
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,116
MANY, MANY MORE.

935
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:14,084
OKAY, I THINK IT'S
TIME TO OPEN THE BAR,

936
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:15,486
SO ON BEHALF OF
MYSELF AND HAROLD

937
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:17,488
AND THE WHOLE GANG UP
HERE AT POSSUM LODGE,

938
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:19,256
KEEP YOUR STICK
ON THE ICE.
HAPPY NEW YEAR!

939
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:21,158
HAPPY NEW YEAR!

940
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:44,648
[cheers and applause]
