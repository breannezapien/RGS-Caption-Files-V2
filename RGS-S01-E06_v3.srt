WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR.

WE'RE ONLY HALF AN HOUR AWAY

AND--WELL, IT'S HIS OWN SHOW.

16
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,291

00:00:59,158 --> 00:00:59,826
AND HE HIRED ME.

19
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:01,327
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHY IT'S

20
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:02,195
CALLED HIS SHOW 'CAUSE

21
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:03,429
OTHERWISE, WE'D CALL IT LIKE

"REAL TRUE LIFE"

23
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:05,265
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

24
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,199
BUT WE'LL HAVE TO STICK TO

25
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:07,233
THE RED GREEN SHOW.

26
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,802

00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,029
A FREE HAIRCUT, SO GOLLY, WE HAD

41

OLD MAN SEDGEWICK ENDED UP

00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,833
LOSING AN EAR, YOU KNOW,

45
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,435
BUT NO BIG DEAL.

46
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,603
HE DOESN'T USE THEM ANYWAY,

47
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,771
YOU KNOW.

48
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,905
AND MOOSE THOMPSON SAID THAT HE

49
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:46,706
WAS ONLY FOLLOWING ORDERS.

50
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:47,774
HOW WAS HE SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT

51
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,108
A LITTLE OFF THE SIDE ONLY MEANT

52
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:50,510

AND SPEAKING OF A LITTLE OFF THE

54
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:53,746
SIDE, COME ON OVER HERE, HAROLD.

WERE LUCKY ENOUGH NOT TO BE

61
00:01:59,952 --> 00:02:01,154
AND HE HAS A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT

62
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,589
HERE THAT ENABLES HIM TO MOVE US

63

MOVING FAST ENOUGH.

66
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,261
HE JUST HITS SOME BUTTONS THERE,

67
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,262
AND...

68
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,696
OH, FOR GOD SAKES, HAROLD.

JUST GET US BACK HERE

>> HEY, NOW, I WANT TO FINISH

75
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:19,105
THIS STORY.

HERE, I'LL GET IT BACK.

77
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,308
>> DON'T TOUCH IT!

WHERE ALL THE BIRDS FLY

85
00:02:38,624 --> 00:02:40,493
I BLOW THEM AND BLAST THEM

THEY'LL MAKE YOUR HEART SING

00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:53,906
HUNTING IS HEAVEN

92
00:02:53,906 --> 00:02:56,042
IT'S A SPORT FOR REAL MEN

93
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,310
AND AS SOON AS

THIS WEEK IN THE HANDYMAN

98
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,962
CORNER, WE'RE GONNA SHOW YOU HOW

99
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,797
TO MAKE IT A LOT SAFER TO DRIVE

100
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,198
AT NIGHT.

101
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,900
STEP NUMBER ONE IS, YOU THROW

102
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,168
OLD MAN SEDGEWICK'S TRUCK KEYS

103
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:24,370
INTO THE LAKE.

104
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,005
STEP TWO, YOU GO AROUND THE

105
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,540
FRONT OF YOUR VEHICLE AND YOU

106
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,109
COUNT THE NUMBER OF HEADLIGHTS.

107
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,645
I COME UP WITH THE NUMBER TWO,

108
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:34,547
NOT ONE OF MY FAVORITES.

109
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:39,452
I MUCH PREFER THE NUMBER 10.

110
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:40,586
RIGHT NOW, WE'VE GOT THE

111
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:42,388
HEADLIGHTS ALL ATTACHED WITH THE

112
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,823
HANDYMAN'S SECRET WEAPON,

113
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:45,191
DUCT TAPE.

114
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,592
STRONG AND YET FLEXIBLE

115
00:03:46,592 --> 00:03:47,760
ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN ADJUST THE

116
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,894
HEADLIGHTS, SAY, EVEN AFTER

117
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:49,562
THEY'RE IN POSITION.

118
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,564
SO I CAN HAVE TWO FACING LEFT,

119
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,065
A COUPLE UP, A COUPLE DOWN,

120
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:54,033
A COUPLE TO THE RIGHT, AND THE

121
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:55,434
OTHER ONES JUST TO KIND OF

122
00:03:55,434 --> 00:03:56,435
FILL IN.

123
00:03:56,435 --> 00:03:57,269
I'M GONNA SEE ANYTHING ON THE

124
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:58,537
ROAD IN FRONT OF ME WITH A RIG

125
00:03:58,537 --> 00:03:59,405
LIKE THIS.

126
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,740
AND EVEN IF ONE OR TWO OF THEM

127
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,041
ARE BURNED OUT, THAT'S STILL NO

128
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,342
REAL BIG PROBLEM.

129
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:05,010
NOW, OBVIOUSLY, IT'S GONNA TAKE

130
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,278
A LITTLE EXTRA POWER TO RUN

131
00:04:06,278 --> 00:04:07,913
A SYSTEM LIKE THIS.

132
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:08,814
SO WHAT I DO IS, I RUN THE

133
00:04:08,814 --> 00:04:10,316
BATTERY CABLE, JUMPER-TYPE

134
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,750
CABLE, BATTERY CABLES BACK TO

135
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,618
THE BACK.

136
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:13,452
I DON'T HAVE ONE LONG ENOUGH,

137
00:04:13,452 --> 00:04:14,854
SO I HOOK TWO TOGETHER, AND

138
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:15,821
THAT'S--AS LONG AS IT'S OUTSIDE

139
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:16,589
THE CAR, I THINK THAT'S

140
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,457
SAFE ENOUGH.

141
00:04:18,457 --> 00:04:19,258
I TAKE THEM RIGHT THROUGH

142
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:20,926
THE WINDSHIELD--OR WHERE THE

143
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:21,927
WINDSHIELD USED TO BE--

144
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:24,096
INTO THE BACKSEAT AREA,

145
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:26,098
AND WHAT I HAVE IN HERE IS,

146
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:27,766
I GOT FOUR BATTERIES,

147
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:30,669
AND THEY'RE WIRED IN PARALLEL

148
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:34,039
WITH COAT HANGERS, AND I HOOK

149
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:35,307
THEM UP, AND THEY POWER ALL

150
00:04:35,307 --> 00:04:36,642
MY EXTRA LIGHTING.

151
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:38,811
AND NOW, THE WIFE MIGHT THINK

152
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:39,712
THAT THIS IS KIND OF AN

153
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,380
UGLY-LOOKING RIG, BUT I GOT

154
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,681
A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR YOU THAT

155
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:44,116
MIGHT EVEN SATISFY HER,

156
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:47,486
BUT I DOUBT IT.

157
00:04:47,486 --> 00:04:49,054
NOW, WHAT I'VE DONE HERE IS,

158
00:04:49,054 --> 00:04:50,789
I'VE MOUNTED A EUROPEAN-STYLE

159
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:51,457
SPOILER ON THE FRONT

160
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,925
LIKE YOU SEE ON YOUR MASERATIS

161
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,094
AND FERRARIS AND ISUZUS.

162
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:55,961
AND WHAT KIND OF A WORLD WOULD

163
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:56,896
THIS BE WITHOUT DUCT TAPE,

164
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,030
I ASK YOU.

165
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:58,898
NOW, IT'S ACTUALLY JUST A PIECE

166
00:04:58,898 --> 00:04:59,565
OF PLYWOOD.

167
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:00,532
I GOT A C-CLAMP ON THERE, AND I

168
00:05:00,532 --> 00:05:02,635
GOT AN OLD GARAGE DOOR OPENER

169
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,336
HERE, WHICH IS GONNA RAISE AND

170
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:05,771
LOWER THE WHOLE UNIT.

171
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:07,339
TALK ABOUT SPORTY.

172
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:08,340
SO IF YOU GUYS WANT TO JUST

173
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,341
THROW ON YOUR WELDING GOGGLES AT

174
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:10,442
THE FRONT THERE, LET'S GIVE THIS

175
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:12,845
RIG A TRY.

176
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:26,425
WELL, IF THAT ISN'T ATTRACTIVE

177
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:28,060
AND SPORTY AND STYLISH ALL AT

178
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,928
THE SAME TIME, THEN, HEY,

179
00:05:29,928 --> 00:05:31,397
KNOCK ME DOWN AND LET ME GET

180
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,331
BACK UP AGAIN.

181
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:33,032
SO IT'S THAT EASY.

182
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:33,799
YOU CAN DO IT YOURSELF.

183
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:34,466
YOU GOT THE TOOLS

184
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:35,134
AND THE KNOWHOW.

185
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:37,102
UNTIL NEXT TIME, REMEMBER THIS.

186
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:38,103
IF THE WOMEN DON'T FIND YOU

187
00:05:38,103 --> 00:05:39,605
HANDSOME, THEY SHOULD AT LEAST

188
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:42,508
FIND YOU HANDY.

189
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:46,078
[engine turns sluggishly]

190
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:50,649
DON'T GO AWAY.

191
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:51,483
I'M SURE YOU WANT TO HEAR THE

192
00:05:51,483 --> 00:05:52,985
END OF THE HAIRCUTTING STORY.

193
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:53,852
>> OH, YEAH, THAT'S A REAL

194
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:57,489
NAIL-BITER FOR SURE.

195
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,604
>> IT IS WINTER.

196
00:06:12,604 --> 00:06:13,672
THE MOONLIGHT BOUNCES OFF

197
00:06:13,672 --> 00:06:15,207
THE ICY LAKE.

198
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:16,708
THE STREET LIGHTS BOUNCE OFF

199
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,410
THE ICY ROADS.

200
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,845
YOUR CAR BOUNCES OFF

201
00:06:19,845 --> 00:06:22,247
THE ICY GUARDRAILS.

202
00:06:22,247 --> 00:06:23,682
YOUR HEAD BOUNCES OFF

203
00:06:23,682 --> 00:06:25,918
THE DASHBOARD.

204
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,786
YOUR CHECK BOUNCES OFF THE BRAIN

205
00:06:27,786 --> 00:06:30,622
SURGEON'S RECEPTION DESK.

206
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,693
SO ANYWAY, GETTING BACK TO THIS

207
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:36,328
HAIRCUTTING KIT THAT MOOSE

208
00:06:36,328 --> 00:06:38,163
THOMPSON HAD, YOU KNOW, STINKY

209
00:06:38,163 --> 00:06:39,932
PETERSON GETS HIS HAIR CUT ABOUT

210
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,567
AS OFTEN AS HE WASHES IT, WHICH

211
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,368
WORKS OUT TO ABOUT ONCE EVERY

212
00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:45,237
FOUR YEARS.

213
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:46,204
SO THE IDEA OF GETTING A FREE

214
00:06:46,204 --> 00:06:47,439
HAIRCUT WAS PRETTY APPEALING TO

215
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,607
HIM, EVEN THOUGH IT MEANT THAT

216
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:50,409
SEVERAL FORMS OF WILDLIFE WERE

217
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,743
GONNA HAVE TO FIND A NEW NATURAL

218
00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:53,812
HABITAT.

219
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:55,347
SO MOOSE, UNFORTUNATELY, WASN'T

220
00:06:55,347 --> 00:06:56,848
INTERESTED IN SHAMPOOING

221
00:06:56,848 --> 00:06:58,517
STINKY'S HAIR, SO WHAT HE DONE

222
00:06:58,517 --> 00:06:59,952
WAS, HE JUST COMBED IT STRAIGHT

223
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:03,255
UP WITH A GARDEN RAKE, AND THEN

224
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:04,723
MARKED A LINE ACROSS USING

225
00:07:04,723 --> 00:07:07,526
A T-SQUARE AND A PIECE OF CHALK.

226
00:07:07,526 --> 00:07:08,794
BUT THEN WHEN HE WENT TO CUT IT,

227
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:10,195
GOLLY, IT BROKE ALL THE BLADES

228
00:07:10,195 --> 00:07:12,264
IN THE RAZOR.

229
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:13,598
SO THIS MAKES MOOSE PRETTY MAD.

230
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:15,334
PLUS STINKY'S HAIR IS LOOKING

231
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,969
LIKE A HEDGE ON DRUGS, YOU KNOW,

232
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:18,770
AND STINKY WANTED HIS MONEY

233
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,604
BACK, OF COURSE, BUT THEN HE

234
00:07:19,604 --> 00:07:20,772
HADN'T PAID ANYTHING, SO HE SAID

235
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:22,741
HE WAS WILLING TO TAKE A CHECK.

236
00:07:22,741 --> 00:07:24,076
>> UNCLE RED. UNCLE RED, LOOK.

237
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,243
I'VE MADE MY VIDEO DEVICE

238
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:28,180
MACHINE INTO A TIME MACHINE.

239
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,047
>> WELL, HOW DOES THAT WORK,

240
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:29,781
HAROLD?

241
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:30,615
>> OH, EASY. WATCH THIS.

242
00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:31,416
WATCH THIS.

243
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,417
LIKE, I'LL SET IT FOR FIVE

244
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:34,419
MINUTES INTO THE FUTURE, RIGHT?

245
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:35,787
TO SAY, LIKE, WHEN THE

246
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:36,755
HAIRCUTTING STORY WAS OVER,

247
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:37,589
FOR INSTANCE.

248
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:42,060
AND PUSH A COUPLE BUTTONS...

249
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,095
AND PRESTO,

250
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:44,496
WE'RE INTO THE FUTURE.

251
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:45,297
>> WE'RE NOT INTO THE FUTURE,

252
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:45,964
HAROLD.

253
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:46,698
WE'RE JUST INTO THE NEXT

254
00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:47,699
SEGMENT.

255
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:49,868
>> OH, WELL, THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH.

256
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:52,370
>> OH, RED GREEN.

257
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,038
>> YEAH?

258
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:54,239
>> THIS IS A SURPRISE.

259
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:55,040
IT'S A BIG SURPRISE!

260
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,974
>> YEAH.

261
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:57,409
[laughs]

262
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:58,477
>> A REAL LIVE HUMAN BEING.

263
00:07:58,477 --> 00:07:59,144
>> YEAH.

264
00:07:59,144 --> 00:07:59,811
>> PLEASE, COME IN.

265
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:00,612
THIS IS GREAT. THIS IS GREAT.

266
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:01,346
WIPE YOUR FEET THERE.

267
00:08:01,346 --> 00:08:02,114
>> OH, SORRY.

268
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,348
YEAH, OKAY.

269
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:05,550
WELL, RANGER GORD, I UNDERSTAND

270
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,686
THE FOREST IS REAL, REAL DRY.

271
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:09,087
AND WE JUST POPPED IN BECAUSE I

272
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:11,189
GUESS THE FIRE DANGER HAS GOT TO

273
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:12,324
BE UP THERE NOW, ISN'T IT?

274
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:13,091
>> OH, IT'S VERY DANGEROUS.

275
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:13,792
>> YEAH. YEAH.

276
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:14,459
>> IT'S VERY, VERY DRY.

277
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:16,561
IT HASN'T BEEN THIS DRY SINCE

278
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:17,629
ALL THE TIME I'VE BEEN UP HERE.

279
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:18,296
>> OH!

280
00:08:18,296 --> 00:08:19,097
>> AND WE HAVEN'T HAD RAIN NOW

281
00:08:19,097 --> 00:08:19,764
FOR 23 DAYS.

282
00:08:19,764 --> 00:08:20,499
>> OH, GOSH!

283
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:21,366
>> AND EVEN WHEN IT DID RAIN 23

284
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:22,334
DAYS AGO, IT ONLY RAINED FOR

285
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:23,201
ABOUT 2 HOURS.

286
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:25,036
AND 7 DAYS PREVIOUS TO THAT,

287
00:08:25,036 --> 00:08:26,771
IT DRIZZLED FOR 17, 18 MINUTES,

288
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:28,139
BUT NOTHING OF ANY CONSEQUENCE.

289
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:29,407
MAYBE, OH, 1/2 AN INCH,

290
00:08:29,407 --> 00:08:30,075
3/4 OF AN INCH.

291
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:30,742
>> OH, YEAH.

292
00:08:30,742 --> 00:08:31,610
>> NOTHING OF ANY CONSEQUENCE.

293
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,277
>> YEAH.

294
00:08:32,277 --> 00:08:33,044
>> A LITTLE TIME PREVIOUS TO

295
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:33,879
THAT, IT RAINED FOR MAYBE FOUR

296
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:34,746
OR FIVE MINUTES, BUT NOTHING--

297
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:35,413
NOTHING REALLY OF ANY

298
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:36,081
CONSEQUENCE.

299
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:36,748
>> OH, YEAH.

300
00:08:36,748 --> 00:08:37,549
>> IT'S INTERESTING, BUT...

301
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:38,216
>> OH, YEAH.

302
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:39,050
>> IT'S VERY, VERY DRY.

303
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:39,884
ALL THE TIME I'VE BEEN UP HERE,

304
00:08:39,884 --> 00:08:41,119
I HAVEN'T SEEN IT THIS DRY.

305
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:42,020
>> OH, YEAH. YEAH, YEAH.

306
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,854
>> EVERYTHING MADE OUT OF WOOD

307
00:08:42,854 --> 00:08:43,622
IS SHRINKING, YOU KNOW.

308
00:08:43,622 --> 00:08:45,090
>> I'M SENSING THAT, YEAH.

309
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,391
>> I HAVE TO RETUNE MY AUTOHARP

310
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:47,058
EVERY DAY.

311
00:08:47,058 --> 00:08:47,959
>> OH, GOSH.

312
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:48,660
YOU HAVE AN AUTOHARP.

313
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,995
>> I'VE BEEN WORKING ON A MEDLEY

314
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:50,662
OF HITS BY THE CAPTAIN

315
00:08:50,662 --> 00:08:51,329
AND TENNILLE.

316
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:52,831
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR ME PLAY?

317
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:54,199
>> WELL, MAYBE LATER, YOU KNOW,

318
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:57,636
OR SOME OTHER TIME OR SOMETHING.

319
00:08:57,636 --> 00:08:58,336
>> ARE THEY STILL HOT,

320
00:08:58,336 --> 00:08:59,504
CAPTAIN AND TENNILLE?

321
00:08:59,504 --> 00:09:00,505
>> WELL, YOU'LL HAVE TO ASK

322
00:09:00,505 --> 00:09:01,573
HAROLD ABOUT THAT.

323
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:02,974
WHAT I WANTED YOU TO DO, THOUGH,

324
00:09:02,974 --> 00:09:04,042
RANGER GORD, IF YOU DON'T MIND,

325
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:06,144
IS TELL OUR VIEWERS ABOUT SOME

326
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:07,612
OF THE DANGERS OF YOUR JOB,

327
00:09:07,612 --> 00:09:08,747
FIRE WATCHING.

328
00:09:08,747 --> 00:09:09,714
>> WELL, I'D LOVE TO, RED.

329
00:09:09,714 --> 00:09:11,649
>> OKAY, GREAT.

330
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:13,752
>> WELL, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

331
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:16,121
BOYS AND GIRLS, ONE OF THE MAJOR

332
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:18,023
DANGERS IN WATCHING A FIRE IS

333
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:18,923
THAT IF YOU WATCH THEM

334
00:09:18,923 --> 00:09:20,992
TOO CLOSE, YOU CAN BURN YOUR

335
00:09:20,992 --> 00:09:22,293
EYEBROWS RIGHT OFF.

336
00:09:22,293 --> 00:09:25,130
SO BE VERY CAREFUL THERE.

337
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,297
NOW, AND THE OTHER THING IS, IF

338
00:09:26,297 --> 00:09:27,999
I DIDN'T HAVE A FIRE TO WATCH

339
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:30,101

00:12:54,171 --> 00:12:56,107
UNCLE RED.

511
00:12:56,107 --> 00:12:57,575
OKAY, LETTER NUMBER ONE.

512
00:12:57,575 --> 00:13:00,177
"DEAR RED GREEN, LAST YEAR I SAW

513
00:13:00,177 --> 00:13:01,712
EVERY EPISODE OF YOUR SHOW, AND

514
00:13:01,712 --> 00:13:02,880
THIS YEAR WE GOT OUR TV DIAL

515
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,781
FIXED, AND I'VE BEEN WATCHING

516
00:13:03,781 --> 00:13:06,050
SOME OTHER SHOWS, AND THEY'RE

517
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:06,717
ALL TALKING ABOUT THE

518
00:13:06,717 --> 00:13:07,385
ENVIRONMENT.

519
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:09,120
WHAT ABOUT YOU?"

520
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,855
>> WELL, HAROLD, ONE OF THE

521
00:13:10,855 --> 00:13:12,490
BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE FACE IS THE

522
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,225
DESTRUCTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT

523
00:13:14,225 --> 00:13:20,097
THROUGH THE USE OF CFFs OR FCs.

524
00:13:20,097 --> 00:13:21,365
WELL, REALLY WHAT THEY'RE

525
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:23,134
CALLED, FLUOROCARBONS,

526
00:13:23,134 --> 00:13:26,470
OR CARBOFLUORON, I THINK.

527
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,304
WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT STUFF

528
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:29,807
THEY USE IN REFRIGERATORS?

529
00:13:29,807 --> 00:13:30,474
>> WHAT?

530
00:13:30,474 --> 00:13:31,642
OH, SORRY, WHAT?

531
00:13:31,642 --> 00:13:32,610
SORRY, I WAS MAKING UP A CARTOON

532
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,578
IN MY MIND.

533
00:13:34,578 --> 00:13:35,279
>> I WAS TALKING ABOUT

534
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,413
REFRIGERATION.

535
00:13:36,413 --> 00:13:37,214
WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT STUFF

536
00:13:37,214 --> 00:13:37,882
THEY USE IN THERE?

537
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:38,883
YOU KNOW, IT'S IN YOUR CAR

538
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:39,583
AIR-CONDITIONER.

539
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:40,484
>> MY CAR DOESN'T HAVE AN

540
00:13:40,484 --> 00:13:41,552
AIR-CONDITIONER.

541
00:13:41,552 --> 00:13:42,353
>> WHY NOT?

542
00:13:42,353 --> 00:13:43,888
>> IT'S A MOTORCYCLE.

543
00:13:43,888 --> 00:13:44,588
>> WHAT WAS I JUST TALKING

544
00:13:44,588 --> 00:13:45,256
ABOUT?

545
00:13:45,256 --> 00:13:46,090
>> CARBOFLUORONS?

546
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,491
>> YEAH, OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

547
00:13:47,491 --> 00:13:48,359
SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS, WE GOT

548
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:51,162
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE

549
00:13:51,162 --> 00:13:53,030
OZONE.

550
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,298
>> OH, HOW YOU DO THAT?

551
00:13:54,298 --> 00:13:55,933
>> WELL, OZONE IS PRODUCED

552
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:56,867
WHENEVER THERE IS AN ELECTRICAL

553
00:13:56,867 --> 00:13:58,035
SHORT CIRCUIT.

554
00:13:58,035 --> 00:13:59,069
REMEMBER THAT TIME WHEN WE

555
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:01,205
DROPPED THE S.O.S. PAD INTO THE

556
00:14:01,205 --> 00:14:01,906
HAIRDRYER?

557
00:14:01,906 --> 00:14:03,140
REMEMBER THAT SMELL?

558
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,275
>> YEAH.

559
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:05,676
>> WELL, THAT WAS OZONE.

560
00:14:05,676 --> 00:14:06,744
>> ARE YOU SURE?

561
00:14:06,744 --> 00:14:07,478
I THOUGHT WAS THE KITCHEN

562
00:14:07,478 --> 00:14:08,345
ON FIRE.

563
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:10,114
>> NO, I MEAN BEFORE THAT.

564
00:14:10,114 --> 00:14:11,048
>> ARE YOU SURE?

565
00:14:11,048 --> 00:14:11,849
'CAUSE I DON'T THINK OZONE

566
00:14:11,849 --> 00:14:12,549
HAS A SMELL.

567
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:14,184
>> OH, YEAH, OZONE HAS A SMELL.

568
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:15,719
GO SNIFF THE BACK OF THE FRIDGE.

569
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:17,721
>> NO, THAT'S FLARBOCOOLENS.

570
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:21,025
THAT'S LIKE FCF--FCCs Fs.

571
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:22,059
>> ALL RIGHT, FORGET THAT.

572
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:22,860
WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT STUFF

573
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,329
THEY MAKE STYROFOAM CUPS OUT OF?

574
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:27,331
>> STYROFOAM.

575
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:29,700
>> YEAH, WELL, THAT HAS C--

576
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,769
CFFF CFs IN IT.

577
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:32,436
>> ARE YOU SURE?

578
00:14:32,436 --> 00:14:33,304
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE PLASTIC

579
00:14:33,304 --> 00:14:34,338
HAMBURGER BOX THAT HAD

580
00:14:34,338 --> 00:14:36,040
FLARBOCOOLENS IN IT.

581
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,675
>> NO, IT'S THE HAMBURGERS.

582
00:14:37,675 --> 00:14:38,942
>> ARE THE FRENCH FRIES OKAY?

583
00:14:38,942 --> 00:14:39,777
ARE THE FRENCH FRIES OKAY,

584
00:14:39,777 --> 00:14:40,744
UNCLE RED?

585
00:14:40,744 --> 00:14:42,346
>> YEAH, YEAH, THEY ARE, HAROLD.

586
00:14:42,346 --> 00:14:43,180
>> OH! OOH!

587
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,348
>> IN FACT, I THINK IF YOU EAT

588
00:14:44,348 --> 00:14:45,215
ENOUGH FRENCH FRIES,

589
00:14:45,215 --> 00:14:47,117
YOU ACTUALLY PRODUCE OZONE.

590
00:14:47,117 --> 00:14:48,352
>> ARE YOU SURE?

591
00:14:48,352 --> 00:14:49,453
>> WELL, REMEMBER THE SMELL FROM

592
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:50,254
THE HAIRDRYER?

593
00:14:50,254 --> 00:14:53,157
>> OH, YEAH.

594
00:15:00,931 --> 00:15:02,433
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK WE COULD

595
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:04,068
RETITLE THIS SEGMENT

596
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:07,438
"KIDS, DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME."

597
00:15:07,438 --> 00:15:08,739
BILL BROUGHT US, AS YOU CAN SEE,

598
00:15:08,739 --> 00:15:12,076
A SNOW BLOWER, AND, YOU KNOW,

599
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:13,911
IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S A VALUABLE

600
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:16,246
PART OF OUR EQUIPMENT LIST

601
00:15:16,246 --> 00:15:18,148
UP HERE AT THE LODGE, BUT IT IS

602
00:15:18,148 --> 00:15:19,149
A PIECE OF HEAVY EQUIPMENT,

603
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:21,385
AND YOU SHOULD RESPECT IT.

604
00:15:21,385 --> 00:15:22,886
THE SNOW GOES IN THERE.

605
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:24,354
BILL'S GIVING YOU THE DEMO HERE.

606
00:15:24,354 --> 00:15:25,489
AND IT COMES OUT HERE, YOU KNOW.

607
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:27,324
I MEAN, THAT'S CLEVER, ISN'T IT?

608
00:15:27,324 --> 00:15:28,358
I MEAN, WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU

609
00:15:28,358 --> 00:15:29,026
ASSUME?

610
00:15:29,026 --> 00:15:29,960
AND NEVER PUT YOUR HANDS

611
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,162
ANYWHERE--WELL, LIKE WHAT I'M

612
00:15:32,162 --> 00:15:33,430
DOING, NEVER DO THAT, ALL RIGHT,

613
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,765
FOR STARTERS.

614
00:15:34,765 --> 00:15:35,999
SPEAKING OF STARTERS, BILL'S

615
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:38,368
HAVING A LITTLE PROBLEM THERE.

616
00:15:38,368 --> 00:15:39,670
MR. EXPERT DOESN'T KNOW YOU GOT

617
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,406
TO TURN THE THING ON FIRST.

618
00:15:42,406 --> 00:15:43,307
YEAH, YEAH, I'LL DRINK TO THAT,

619
00:15:43,307 --> 00:15:44,575
BILL.

620
00:15:44,575 --> 00:15:46,143
ANYWAY, UP SHE GOES.

621
00:15:46,143 --> 00:15:47,077
AND WE JUST WANTED TO SHOW

622
00:15:47,077 --> 00:15:48,312
YOU--ACTUALLY, BILL HAS SOME

623
00:15:48,312 --> 00:15:50,347
INTERESTING IDEAS HOW YOU CAN

624
00:15:50,347 --> 00:15:52,149
ADAPT A SNOW BLOWER TO, YOU

625
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:53,884
KNOW, REALLY HELP YOU AS A TOOL,

626
00:15:53,884 --> 00:15:55,752
AND IT IS KIND OF INTERESTING.

627
00:15:55,752 --> 00:15:57,387
I THINK IT'S JUST UNFORTUNATE

628
00:15:57,387 --> 00:15:59,756
THAT WE PICKED GARBAGE DAY AS

629
00:15:59,756 --> 00:16:01,825
THE DAY TO TRY AND DO THIS.

630
00:16:01,825 --> 00:16:03,393
I MEAN, MAYBE IF BILL WAS PAYING

631
00:16:03,393 --> 00:16:04,228
A LITTLE MORE ATTENTION, THAT

632
00:16:04,228 --> 00:16:05,629
WOULDN'T HAVE HURT EITHER,

633
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:06,430
YOU KNOW.

634
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,432
BUT, YOU KNOW, THEY ARE

635
00:16:08,432 --> 00:16:12,002
A POWERFUL MACHINE.

636
00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:13,937
I GOT A HINT OF WHAT WE'D HAD

637
00:16:13,937 --> 00:16:16,073
FOR DINNER THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS

638
00:16:16,073 --> 00:16:18,041
AT THE LODGE.

639
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,176
I THINK THAT PORK WAS

640
00:16:19,176 --> 00:16:20,811
UNDERCOOKED.

641
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:22,245
BUT ON WE GO ANYWAY.

642
00:16:22,245 --> 00:16:23,413
WHAT BILL REALLY WANTED TO SHOW

643
00:16:23,413 --> 00:16:25,649
YOU HERE WAS--THIS IS SOMETHING

644
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:26,383
KIND OF INTERESTING THAT

645
00:16:26,383 --> 00:16:27,150
HE THOUGHT UP.

646
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,919
I DIDN'T COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND

647
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:30,120
IT AT FIRST, BECAUSE I JUST SAW

648
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,355
HIM TYING THE ROPE ONTO THE SNOW

649
00:16:31,355 --> 00:16:33,323
BLOWER, AND I REALLY WAS A

650
00:16:33,323 --> 00:16:35,359
LITTLE BIT--WELL, YOU CAN SEE

651
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:36,159
THERE.

652
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:37,060
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

653
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:37,894
THEN HE TIED THE OTHER END OF

654
00:16:37,894 --> 00:16:39,997
THE ROPE TO A TREE.

655
00:16:39,997 --> 00:16:41,498
AND YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S GOT IN

656
00:16:41,498 --> 00:16:43,333
MIND HERE IS, I THINK THIS IS

657
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,334
SOMETHING THAT HE MAY HAVE SEEN

658
00:16:44,334 --> 00:16:46,470
IN A CARTOON, YOU KNOW, WHICH HE

659
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,171
GOES TO REGULARLY.

660
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:49,606
AND THE IDEA IS, YOU START THE

661
00:16:49,606 --> 00:16:51,975
SNOW BLOWER UP, AND IT WINDS

662
00:16:51,975 --> 00:16:53,777
AROUND THE TREE, YOU SEE, AND IT

663
00:16:53,777 --> 00:16:55,045
CLEARS THE WHOLE AREA WITHOUT

664
00:16:55,045 --> 00:16:55,912
YOU ACTUALLY HAVING TO DO

665
00:16:55,912 --> 00:16:57,180
ANY WORK.

666
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,583
SO YOU'D THINK THAT--WELL,

667
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,650
BILL'S A BIT OF A SLOW LEARNER,

668
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,019
YOU KNOW, WITH THE--THERE WE GO.

669
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:04,187
ALL RIGHT.

670
00:17:04,187 --> 00:17:05,589
SO ANYWAY, HE GETS IT GOING, AND

671
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:06,656
THE WHEELS ARE TURNING THERE

672
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:07,557
AROUND, AND WE ENGAGE THE

673
00:17:07,557 --> 00:17:08,291
THROWER.

674
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,993
AND THEN, YOU KNOW, AND WHAT

675
00:17:09,993 --> 00:17:11,762
HAPPENS IS, SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE

676
00:17:11,762 --> 00:17:14,030
WINDING AROUND THE TREE.

677
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,365
AND OF COURSE, EVERY TIME IT

678
00:17:15,365 --> 00:17:17,901
GOES AROUND, THE ROPE WINDS

679
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:21,204
AROUND THE TREE AND BRINGS IT

680
00:17:21,204 --> 00:17:22,706
IN A LITTLE BIT CLOSER, YOU SEE.

681
00:17:22,706 --> 00:17:24,708
NOW, OUR PROBLEM WAS, THE KNOT

682
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,176
WAS JUST SLIPPING AROUND THE

683
00:17:26,176 --> 00:17:27,844
TREE, SO WHAT WAS HAPPENING WAS

684
00:17:27,844 --> 00:17:29,412
THE SNOW BLOWER WASN'T COMING

685
00:17:29,412 --> 00:17:30,113
ANY CLOSER.

686
00:17:30,113 --> 00:17:31,281
IT JUST KEPT GOING OVER AND OVER

687
00:17:31,281 --> 00:17:32,249
THE SAME CIRCLE.

688
00:17:32,249 --> 00:17:33,617
SO BILL FIGURED IF HE GAVE IT A

689
00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:34,684
TUG AND TIED THE KNOT A LITTLE

690
00:17:34,684 --> 00:17:36,820
TIGHTER, AND I GUESS I SHOULD

691
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,288
HAVE PAID MORE ATTENTION TO WHAT

692
00:17:38,288 --> 00:17:39,789
WAS HAPPENING.

693
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:41,925
HE KIND OF TURNED IT, AND IT

694
00:17:41,925 --> 00:17:44,494
KIND OF WAS--WELL, YOU--WELL,

695
00:17:44,494 --> 00:17:46,496
NOW THIS IS REAL DANGEROUS,

696
00:17:46,496 --> 00:17:48,098
I THINK.

697
00:17:48,098 --> 00:17:49,866
MAYBE IT'S JUST ME, YOU KNOW.

698
00:17:49,866 --> 00:17:50,967
OH!

699
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:54,471
OH, OH, OH, OH!

700
00:17:54,471 --> 00:17:55,972
OH, BILL, THAT'S--

701
00:17:55,972 --> 00:17:56,940
NOW, THAT'S BILL'S UNDERWEAR.

702
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,876
I DON'T--NO, OH, FOR...

703
00:17:59,876 --> 00:18:01,144
SNOW HE'S WEARING THERE.

704
00:18:01,144 --> 00:18:02,045
WELL, WHAT SOME GUYS WILL DO TO

705
00:18:02,045 --> 00:18:06,149
INCREASE THEIR SPERM COUNT.

706
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:07,417
IT IS WINTER.

707
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:09,619
THE JOINTS STIFFEN AS THE COLD

708
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:11,221
SETS IN.

709
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:12,589
THE NORTH WIND BLOWS ICE PELLETS

710
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:14,291
INTO YOUR EYES.

711
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,226
YOU WONDER AT ITS BRUTALITY

712
00:18:16,226 --> 00:18:17,827
AND POINTLESSNESS.

713
00:18:17,827 --> 00:18:20,597
THEN YOUR MIND TURNS TO HOCKEY.

714
00:18:35,645 --> 00:18:37,180
THIS IS THE POINT IN THE SHOW

715
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,015
WHERE WE GIVE HAROLD A CHANCE TO

716
00:18:39,015 --> 00:18:41,384
SAY WHAT'S ON HIS MIND.

717
00:18:41,384 --> 00:18:42,252
WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING TO KILL

718
00:18:42,252 --> 00:18:44,054
THE TIME.

719
00:18:44,054 --> 00:18:44,854
GO AHEAD.

720
00:18:44,854 --> 00:18:46,756
>> OKAY.

721
00:18:46,756 --> 00:18:47,657
BULLIES, OKAY?

722
00:18:47,657 --> 00:18:49,159
ALL RIGHT, WELL, YOU KNOW WHO

723
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:50,126
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

724
00:18:50,126 --> 00:18:51,061
THOSE PEOPLE WHO BEAT YOU

725
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:52,395
OFF ON THE WAY TO SCHOOL,

726
00:18:52,395 --> 00:18:56,166
IN THE SUPERMARKET, IN CHURCH.

727
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,634
WELL, I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HAS

728
00:18:57,634 --> 00:18:58,668
THE RIGHT TO USE PHYSICAL

729
00:18:58,668 --> 00:19:00,703
VIOLENCE ON ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.

730
00:19:00,703 --> 00:19:02,138
WELL, ALL RIGHT, UNLESS, OF

731
00:19:02,138 --> 00:19:03,373
COURSE, LIKE, YOU'RE BATMAN OR

732
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:04,607
THE POLICE OR SOMETHING,

733
00:19:04,607 --> 00:19:06,276
AND THEN IT'S OKAY.

734
00:19:06,276 --> 00:19:07,377
AND I DON'T MIND BEING ATTACKED

735
00:19:07,377 --> 00:19:08,077
VERBALLY.

736
00:19:08,077 --> 00:19:09,112
THAT'S OKAY.

737
00:19:09,112 --> 00:19:10,780
YOU KNOW, REALLY, I'M GETTING

738
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,782
USED TO THAT, BUT I GOT A

739
00:19:12,782 --> 00:19:13,783
WALKMAN, SO I DON'T EVEN NOTICE

740
00:19:13,783 --> 00:19:16,119
MUCH ANYMORE.

741
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:17,620
BUT WHEN IT RESORTS TO FISTS,

742
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,055
I JUST HAVE TO STOP AND SAY,

743
00:19:19,055 --> 00:19:21,591
"ENOUGH!"

744
00:19:21,591 --> 00:19:22,625
BUT USUALLY THAT

745
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,094
DOESN'T HELP EITHER.

746
00:19:25,094 --> 00:19:26,596
YOU KNOW, OKAY, ALL RIGHT, YES,

747
00:19:26,596 --> 00:19:28,231
WHEN I GET PUNCHED BY SOME

748
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:29,966
MORON, I CAN RESORT TO, LIKE,

749
00:19:29,966 --> 00:19:31,968
IMMATURE TACTICS AS WELL, LIKE

750
00:19:31,968 --> 00:19:33,636
PUNCH HIM BACK OR SOMETHING, OR

751
00:19:33,636 --> 00:19:35,638
I COULD BE MATURE ABOUT IT AND

752
00:19:35,638 --> 00:19:38,741
CRUMBLE INTO A MOANING HEAP.

753
00:19:38,741 --> 00:19:39,809
AND THEN I GO HOME, AND I PLOT

754
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:41,811
AGAINST THEM, LIKE ORDERING 80

755
00:19:41,811 --> 00:19:44,914
PIZZAS TO THEIR HOUSE.

756
00:19:44,914 --> 00:19:46,015
SEE, YOU HAVE TO DO THAT.

757
00:19:46,015 --> 00:19:47,050
YOU GOT TO USE YOUR BRAINS, OR

758
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,284
OTHERWISE, YOU'VE SUNK TO THEIR

759
00:19:48,284 --> 00:19:50,019
LEVEL, AND THEY'RE GONNA WIN

760
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:51,588
'CAUSE THEY GOT HUGE HAM-SHAPED

761
00:19:51,588 --> 00:19:54,023
FISTS.

762
00:19:54,023 --> 00:19:55,592
BUT THOSE HANDS ARE NO MATCH

763
00:19:55,592 --> 00:20:01,097
FOR THIS: HEAD LICE.

764
00:20:02,832 --> 00:20:03,766
>> WE HAVE LOTS MORE COMING UP

765
00:20:03,766 --> 00:20:04,434
FOR YOU--

766
00:20:04,434 --> 00:20:05,702
NOT JUST THE HAIRCUTTING STORY.

767
00:20:05,702 --> 00:20:07,303
>> OH, THANK GOD.

768
00:20:07,303 --> 00:20:09,739
[horn honking]

769
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:16,779
>> WE'RE UP HERE AT JIMMY

770
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:17,980
MCVAY'S HOUSE.

771
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,549
JIMMY'S NOT HOME FROM WORK YET.

772
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:20,750
I GUESS THEY HAD A HEAVY DAY AT

773
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,851
THE POST OFFICE.

774
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:22,685
I THOUGHT I'D COME UP HERE AND

775
00:20:22,685 --> 00:20:23,686
SEE HOW JIMMY'S DOING WITH THIS

776
00:20:23,686 --> 00:20:26,155
OLD WOODEN BOAT HE'S FIXING UP.

777
00:20:26,155 --> 00:20:28,091
OH, HERE COMES JIMMY NOW.

778
00:20:28,091 --> 00:20:29,559
HOW'D SHE GO TODAY, JIM?

779
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:30,993
>> OH, JEEZ, WHAT A BLOODY DAY.

780
00:20:30,993 --> 00:20:31,761
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

781
00:20:31,761 --> 00:20:32,929
>> THE BLOODY BAG WEIGHS TONS!

782
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:33,663
>> OH!

783
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,364
>> CAN YOU IMAGINE ALL THE

784
00:20:34,364 --> 00:20:35,465
BLOODY LETTERS THAT THEY HAVE US

785
00:20:35,465 --> 00:20:36,632
TAKING AROUND THIS COUNTRY?

786
00:20:36,632 --> 00:20:37,567
>> WELL, YEAH, BUT JIM, YOU'RE

787
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:38,668
A LETTER CARRIER, YOU KNOW.

788
00:20:38,668 --> 00:20:39,335
>> IT'S NOT THE LETTERS,

789
00:20:39,335 --> 00:20:40,002
YOU KNOW.

790
00:20:40,002 --> 00:20:40,870
IT'S THE MAGAZINES.

791
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,038
THE DAMN MAGAZINES

792
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:43,272
MUST WEIGH 60 POUNDS.

793
00:20:43,272 --> 00:20:43,973
>> OH.

794
00:20:43,973 --> 00:20:44,807
>> I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE

795
00:20:44,807 --> 00:20:46,142
SWINGING A BAG LIKE THAT ON YOUR

796
00:20:46,142 --> 00:20:47,543
SHOULDER WHILE YOU'RE CLIMBING

797
00:20:47,543 --> 00:20:49,479
A FENCE WITH A PIT BULL TEARING

798
00:20:49,479 --> 00:20:51,347
THE ARSE OF YOUR TROUSERS?

799
00:20:51,347 --> 00:20:53,015
THAT IS WHAT I CALL STRESS IN

800
00:20:53,015 --> 00:20:53,683
THE WORKPLACE.

801
00:20:53,683 --> 00:20:55,151
>> ABSOLUTELY.

802
00:20:55,151 --> 00:20:56,953
BUT, JIM, DON'T WORRY ABOUT

803
00:20:56,953 --> 00:20:57,753
THAT NOW.

804
00:20:57,753 --> 00:20:59,288
YOU CAN THINK ABOUT YOUR BOAT.

805
00:20:59,288 --> 00:21:00,690
>> OH, MY GOD, RED,

806
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,390
YOU'RE RIGHT.

807
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,058
LOOK AT THAT.

808
00:21:02,058 --> 00:21:03,159
ISN'T SHE A BEAUTY?

809
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:04,627
>> WELL, SHE WILL BE SOMEDAY

810
00:21:04,627 --> 00:21:06,195
MAYBE.

811
00:21:06,195 --> 00:21:07,230
>> I MEAN, LOOK AT THE LINES.

812
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:07,930
>> YEAH.

813
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,365
>> LOOK AT THE CRAFTSMANSHIP.

814
00:21:09,365 --> 00:21:11,234
>> YEAH.

815
00:21:11,234 --> 00:21:12,101
>> I CAN REALLY SMELL THE SEA,

816
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:12,969
CAN'T YOU?

817
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:13,870
>> YEAH, IT'S MORE LIKE A BIG

818
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,171
MUSHROOM, REALLY, JIM.

819
00:21:15,171 --> 00:21:16,005
>> OH, IT'S JUST ABSOLUTELY

820
00:21:16,005 --> 00:21:16,672
BEAUTIFUL.

821
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:19,075
YOU'LL NEVER SEE A FIBERGLASS

822
00:21:19,075 --> 00:21:19,976
BOAT LOOKING LIKE THAT,

823
00:21:19,976 --> 00:21:20,643
WILL YOU?

824
00:21:20,643 --> 00:21:22,245
>> NO, THAT'S FOR SURE.

825
00:21:22,245 --> 00:21:23,913
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN WORKING

826
00:21:23,913 --> 00:21:25,147
ON HER, JIM?

827
00:21:25,147 --> 00:21:26,182
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, NOT THAT

828
00:21:26,182 --> 00:21:26,849
LONG.

829
00:21:26,849 --> 00:21:27,516
>> NO, NO, NO?

830
00:21:27,516 --> 00:21:28,184
>> NO, NO.

831
00:21:28,184 --> 00:21:29,986
ABOUT 6 1/2 YEARS OR SO.

832
00:21:29,986 --> 00:21:31,120
MIND YOU, I DO TAKE A WEEKEND

833
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,787
OFF ONCE A YEAR.

834
00:21:31,787 --> 00:21:32,455
>> YEAH.

835
00:21:32,455 --> 00:21:33,389
>> JUST TO GO TO THE BOAT SHOW.

836
00:21:33,389 --> 00:21:34,590
>> OH.

837
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,758
AND OF COURSE, YOU GOT TO SPEND

838
00:21:35,758 --> 00:21:36,492
TIME WITH THE MISSUS.

839
00:21:36,492 --> 00:21:37,159
>> NO, I DO NOT.

840
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:37,827
>> OH?

841
00:21:37,827 --> 00:21:38,661
>> NO, SHE'S BLOODY WELL GONE.

842
00:21:38,661 --> 00:21:39,328
>> OH, MY GOD.

843
00:21:39,328 --> 00:21:40,129
>> SHE'S AWAY. SHE'S LEFT.

844
00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:40,796
>> SHE LEFT YOU?

845
00:21:40,796 --> 00:21:41,464
>> SHE DID.

846
00:21:41,464 --> 00:21:42,698
SHE DONE A BUNK.

847
00:21:42,698 --> 00:21:44,467
IT WAS A SURPRISE TO ME TOO.

848
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:45,134
>> NO KIDDING.

849
00:21:45,134 --> 00:21:45,935
>> AND I WENT INTO THE HOUSE

850
00:21:45,935 --> 00:21:46,636
THERE JUST TO GET

851
00:21:46,636 --> 00:21:47,937
A COAT HANGER, YOU KNOW, TO MAKE

852
00:21:47,937 --> 00:21:48,804
A HOSE CLAMP FOR THE ENGINE.

853
00:21:48,804 --> 00:21:49,538
>> YEAH, YEAH.

854
00:21:49,538 --> 00:21:50,206
>> AND TO MY AMAZEMENT,

855
00:21:50,206 --> 00:21:50,906
I NOTICED ALL HER CLOTHES

856
00:21:50,906 --> 00:21:51,574
WERE GONE.

857
00:21:51,574 --> 00:21:52,275
NO NOTE OR NOTHING.

858
00:21:52,275 --> 00:21:53,643
NOW, THERE'S WHAT YOU CALL

859
00:21:53,643 --> 00:21:54,910
LOVING SUPPORT, ISN'T IT?

860
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,379
>> WELL, I THINK YOU'RE KIND OF

861
00:21:56,379 --> 00:21:57,113
TO BLAME TOO, JIM.

862
00:21:57,113 --> 00:21:58,280
I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT TO SPEND SOME

863
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,048
TIME WITH THE LITTLE LADY,

864
00:21:59,048 --> 00:21:59,715
YOU KNOW.

865
00:21:59,715 --> 00:22:01,217
>> IT'S NOT LIKE I DIDN'T SPEND

866
00:22:01,217 --> 00:22:01,884
SOME TIME WITH HER.

867
00:22:01,884 --> 00:22:02,551
>> OH.

868
00:22:02,551 --> 00:22:03,219
>> MY DEAR.

869
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:03,886
>> YEAH.

870
00:22:03,886 --> 00:22:04,720
>> I MEAN, I HAD HER UP ON THAT

871
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,688
BOAT ONCE TO HELP ME LIFT THE

872
00:22:05,688 --> 00:22:06,622
ENGINE OUT.

873
00:22:06,622 --> 00:22:07,289
>> OH, YEAH.

874
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:09,759
>> SHE WAS BLOODY USELESS.

875
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:11,227
>> WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD ANYWAY,

876
00:22:11,227 --> 00:22:11,894
YOU KNOW.

877
00:22:11,894 --> 00:22:12,561
>> IT IS.

878
00:22:12,561 --> 00:22:13,295
>> YEAH, IT'S A SHAME.

879
00:22:13,295 --> 00:22:13,963
>> IT IS. IT'S A SHAME.

880
00:22:13,963 --> 00:22:14,664
IT'S A TRAGEDY.

881
00:22:14,664 --> 00:22:15,331
>> YEAH.

882
00:22:15,331 --> 00:22:16,198
>> I MEAN, I COULD HAVE HAD THAT

883
00:22:16,198 --> 00:22:19,068
BOAT IN THE BLOODY WATER BY NOW.

884
00:22:26,709 --> 00:22:27,676
>> WELL, THE HAIRCUTTING

885
00:22:27,676 --> 00:22:29,745
ADVENTURE KIND OF EVENTUALLY

886
00:22:29,745 --> 00:22:32,415
WORKED ITSELF OUT.

887
00:22:32,415 --> 00:22:33,149
HE GOT A LITTLE BIT BETTER

888
00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:33,816
AT IT ANYWAY.

889
00:22:33,816 --> 00:22:34,650
I MEAN, THE INJURY RATE

890
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,418
CERTAINLY WENT DOWN WHEN HE

891
00:22:35,418 --> 00:22:36,819
STOPPED DOING THE SIDES AND THE

892
00:22:36,819 --> 00:22:38,521
BACK AND JUST CONCENTRATED ON

893
00:22:38,521 --> 00:22:40,523
DOING THE TOPS OF THE HEADS.

894
00:22:40,523 --> 00:22:42,024
PROBABLY THE WORST JOB MOOSE DID

895
00:22:42,024 --> 00:22:43,426
WAS WHEN HE CUT HIS OWN HAIR.

896
00:22:43,426 --> 00:22:44,226
YOU KNOW, HE SET UP A BUNCH OF

897
00:22:44,226 --> 00:22:45,861
MIRRORS, AND HE HAD THE RAZOR

898
00:22:45,861 --> 00:22:47,596
AND SOME BARBECUE TONGS THERE,

899
00:22:47,596 --> 00:22:49,098
AND, YOU KNOW, I NEVER KNEW THAT

900
00:22:49,098 --> 00:22:51,767
MOOSE'S SCALP WAS PINK, BUT WE

901
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:53,035
LEARNED SOMETHING, THOUGH.

902
00:22:53,035 --> 00:22:53,736
YOU KNOW, WE LEARNED THAT

903
00:22:53,736 --> 00:22:54,503
EVERYTHING HAS ITS PLACE.

904
00:22:54,503 --> 00:22:56,772
MINE IS HERE, HAROLD'S IS OVER

905
00:22:56,772 --> 00:22:58,641
THERE, AND MOOSE'S BARBER KIT'S

906
00:22:58,641 --> 00:23:00,876
IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LAKE.

907
00:23:00,876 --> 00:23:02,011
SO ANYWAY, IF MY WIFE IS

908
00:23:02,011 --> 00:23:03,045
WATCHING, I'LL BE COMING

909
00:23:03,045 --> 00:23:04,680
STRAIGHT HOME, AND I'M FINE, BUT

910
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,081
I'LL BE WEARING MY HAT FOR THE

911
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:08,017
NEXT SIX WEEKS OR SO.

912
00:23:08,017 --> 00:23:09,185
SO ANYWAY, THANKS FOR WATCHING

913
00:23:09,185 --> 00:23:10,686
THE SHOW, AND ON BEHALF OF

914
00:23:10,686 --> 00:23:12,221
MYSELF AND HAROLD AND THE WHOLE

915
00:23:12,221 --> 00:23:13,355
GANG HERE AT THE LODGE,

916
00:23:13,355 --> 00:23:16,325
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.
