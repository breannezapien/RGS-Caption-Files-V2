to come out here

down this dead tree.

Of course, none of
them showed up.

them out with a chore.

supposed to do?

about these shows

that take a
bunch of people

and put them
on a desert island,

and they get them
swinging from vines

and eating
raw spiders,

138

pretends to be a

but he's actually a
backhoe operator,

they call that
a reality show.

watch it in person.

but that's my
final offer.

163
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:42,067
Bye.

164
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:45,971
Anything else?
You sure?

165
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,540
You know when
you were a kid

166
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,908
you were a
bit of a sucker

167
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:51,176
for any type
of sales pitch,

168
00:06:51,176 --> 00:06:53,445
so you end up with
a whole bunch of stuff
you never use,

169
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:55,981
like life jackets
or hard hats

170
00:06:55,981 --> 00:06:57,482
or a thighmaster

171
00:06:57,482 --> 00:06:59,084
or these things
you're supposed to

172
00:06:59,084 --> 00:07:00,652
stick on your
steering wheel.

173
00:07:00,652 --> 00:07:02,554
Oh sure, you tried it
for a couple of weeks,

174
00:07:02,554 --> 00:07:05,090
but then you realized
putting an anti-theft
device in your car

175
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,593
is like posting an
armed guard at the
city dump.

176
00:07:08,593 --> 00:07:10,696
So now you're stuck
with all this stuff,

177
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:11,997
but what do you do?

178
00:07:11,997 --> 00:07:13,365
You tried
the yard sale,

179
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:15,067
but unfortunately,
people today

180
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,069
are not as gullible
as you were.

181
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,770
Luckily,
on Handyman Corner,

182
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,472
we like to show
that useless things

183
00:07:20,472 --> 00:07:21,873
can have a purpose too.

184
00:07:21,873 --> 00:07:24,443
That's an important message
for your wife and kids.

185
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,448
For example, this tool box is
something I never use.

186
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:31,016
It's way too small

187
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:32,317
for the number
of tools I carry,

188
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:34,019
and the tool boxes
that are big enough,

189
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:35,721
I can't lift.

190
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,355
Instead, I just
let my tools

191
00:07:37,355 --> 00:07:39,725
roll around in the back
of the Possum Van.

192
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,626
It's safe as long
as I don't stop too fast

193
00:07:41,626 --> 00:07:43,628
and with the brakes
on that unit,

194
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:45,330
that's no worry.

195
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,766
But rather than throw
this tool box into the lake,

196
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:50,001
I keep it here
by the fireplace

197
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:52,070
full of all the
assembly directions

198
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,205
and instruction manuals

199
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:55,407
I don't have time
to sit down and read

200
00:07:55,407 --> 00:07:57,242
and never will.

201
00:07:57,242 --> 00:07:59,411
With these babies,
I can start a fire

202
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:03,215
in four
different languages.

203
00:08:03,215 --> 00:08:05,016
Maybe you've got
a couple of kids

204
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:06,618
who are always stealing
food from each other

205
00:08:06,618 --> 00:08:08,153
at the dinner table.

206
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:10,355
It's usually 'cause they're
sitting too close together.

207
00:08:10,355 --> 00:08:13,992
So you need an anti-theft
device keeping them apart.

208
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:16,828
And did you notice
my tablecloth?

209
00:08:16,828 --> 00:08:19,097
Just an old road map out
of the glove compartment.

210
00:08:19,097 --> 00:08:20,866
It's cheap
but it looks good

211
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:23,101
and it encourages
dinner conversation.

212
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:26,004
Cause when you
look at the local towns
and recreation areas,

213
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:27,839
it reminds you of the
hilarious stories

214
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,242
and how you
avoided arrest.

215
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:31,977
And when it gets dirty,

216
00:08:31,977 --> 00:08:33,445
you just crumple it up,

217
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:35,247
and it can hit
the road.

218
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:40,418
You know those smoke detectors
you have in the ceiling,

219
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:42,654
the ones where you haven't
changed the batteries

220
00:08:42,654 --> 00:08:44,089
since the '80s?

221
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,358
Well, they make
dandy doorstops.

222
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:49,661
And you know how the kids
go out the screen door

223
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:51,196
and never close it?

224
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:54,099
Well, hey, that's what a
thighmaster's for.

Now, if you're the
kind of handyman I am,

227
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:07,178
you probably also
have a hard hat that
you never use,

228
00:09:07,178 --> 00:09:09,214
because protecting
your head is, again,

229
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:11,616
like posting an armed
guard at the city dump.

230
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:13,852
Instead, fill it up
with water.

231
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:16,654
makes a dandy bird bath.

232
00:09:16,654 --> 00:09:18,490
And a pair of
safety goggles

233
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,959
makes a real
good bird feeder.

234
00:09:22,193 --> 00:09:25,063
As for those life jackets
that never leave the
boathouse,

235
00:09:25,063 --> 00:09:27,065
wrap them around
the cooler.

236
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:28,867
They add to
the insulation,

237
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:30,735
and if you ever get hit
with a flash flood,

238
00:09:30,735 --> 00:09:32,971
at least the
beer'll be safe.

239
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:34,739
For me, nothing
says summer

240
00:09:34,739 --> 00:09:37,175
like hearing a thighmaster
making my screen door slam,

241
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:40,278
while the birds are
swimming in my hard-hat

242
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:42,113
and I enjoy a brewski

There comes a time in the
life of almost every guy

00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:59,531
when he's gonna
need glasses.

247

He's usually the last one
to see it coming.

You can tell if
you need glasses.

251

If you squint so often
your wife keeps asking

252
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,246
if you're constipated,
that's a clue.

253
00:10:15,246 --> 00:10:19,551
And when it comes,
choose your frames wisely.

254
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:21,886
Some frames complement
your face,

255
00:10:21,886 --> 00:10:24,455
others crack
a joke about it.

256
00:10:24,455 --> 00:10:26,858
Very disappointing to
purchase a pair of bifocals

257
00:10:26,858 --> 00:10:28,993
and the first thing
you can see clearly

258
00:10:28,993 --> 00:10:31,362
is everybody
laughing at you.

Now, you can't tell
what's good and bad

until you see
them on you.

A big pair
of black frames

262
00:10:37,535 --> 00:10:39,637
might make your buddy
look like Henry Kissinger,

00:10:39,637 --> 00:10:42,874
but they make you look
like Orville Redenbacher.

264
00:10:42,874 --> 00:10:44,842
Or those small,
round frames

265
00:10:44,842 --> 00:10:47,412
make your brother
look like John Lennon,

266
00:10:47,412 --> 00:10:49,414
but make you
look like that granny

who carries
Tweety Bird around.

268
00:10:52,283 --> 00:10:55,653
You want to choose the
frames based on the
shape of your head.

269
00:10:55,653 --> 00:10:58,056
You may even need
a range of different styles

270
00:10:58,056 --> 00:11:01,459
because maybe your
head changes shape,

after a compliment
or a party

272

or a skiing accident.

Only get frameless glasses
if you have a shapeless head.

The best thing,
consult your wife.

opinion anyway, right?

to do a little mini-putting.

We got the --
we got the one hole.

You do one hole 18 times,
it's a lot cheaper.

347
00:13:54,565 --> 00:13:57,201
And I'm not sure if this
is going to work out.

348
00:13:57,201 --> 00:13:58,569
I was just trying
to cut the lawn,

349
00:13:58,569 --> 00:14:00,271
but I noticed the
grass is blowing away

350
00:14:00,271 --> 00:14:01,672
as fast as
I was cutting her.

351
00:14:01,672 --> 00:14:03,207
So Walter's going
to give it a try

352
00:14:03,207 --> 00:14:04,642
and just as
he putted up there,

353
00:14:04,642 --> 00:14:06,377
a gust of wind came along,

354
00:14:06,377 --> 00:14:07,978
blew up the end
of the mini-putt.

355
00:14:07,978 --> 00:14:10,347
That was unfortunate.

356
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:12,983
So I guess now
it's Bill's shot.

357
00:14:12,983 --> 00:14:15,352
Just get him out
of the way there and --

358
00:14:15,352 --> 00:14:18,622
So Bill's going
to try her again,

359
00:14:18,622 --> 00:14:20,724
and now he's kinda expecting
another gust of wind

360
00:14:20,724 --> 00:14:24,995
might come along so he ducks
and thinking that was
a good move.

361
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:26,430
Not so.

362
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,335

is really coming up.

I'm thinking to myself,
are you serious?

00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:37,908
Apparently, yes.

There's a tornado coming

We got to get the
yard all cleaned up,

369
00:14:44,882 --> 00:14:46,917
and I think
the best thing --

370
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:49,353
Walter, Walter,
you clean up the yard.

371
00:14:49,353 --> 00:14:52,423
Bill and I will go
and hide somewhere.

So Walter starts
picking --

Now the wind
is really starting,

375

and you can feel it just
starting to twist and
turn a little bit.

376
00:14:59,263 --> 00:15:00,998
Then --
watch out for the rake.

00:15:00,998 --> 00:15:03,333
Oh, boy.

378
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:06,003
And he gets as much
as he can get,

379
00:15:06,003 --> 00:15:07,905
and he's heading
for the shed,

380
00:15:07,905 --> 00:15:10,574
and boy, it's getting
serious there now.

381

There it's coming
right across the field.

Wow!

383
00:15:15,212 --> 00:15:17,614
And so Bill and I are going
to go into the barn there --

00:15:17,614 --> 00:15:20,484
Bill is beating on the --
What's his problem?

385
00:15:20,484 --> 00:15:22,252
I open the door
and let him in,

386
00:15:22,252 --> 00:15:24,221
but he didn't seem
interested,

387
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:26,690
so to heck with it.

388

It's not locked, Bill.
There we go.

389
00:15:30,794 --> 00:15:32,429

took it right off.

That's gone.

391
00:15:33,897 --> 00:15:36,567
And Walter, he decided to
abandon the lawn chairs

392
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:37,835
and the barbeque
and everything

it has a lock
on the outside only.

getting real close now.

anything like this.

Bill was shocked.

400
00:15:52,015 --> 00:15:53,951
Shocked to the point that he
brought his video camera out

401
00:15:53,951 --> 00:15:55,385
and got a little footage.

402
00:15:55,385 --> 00:15:56,887
And it picked up
the lawn mower

403
00:15:56,887 --> 00:15:58,488
and dropped it right
down on the lawn

404
00:15:58,488 --> 00:16:01,124
and started cutting the
lawn as if there was --

it was just spooky.

And then suddenly
it was quiet,

mind actually.

00:19:08,778 --> 00:19:12,515
Our clientele has
no appreciation of art.

475
00:19:12,515 --> 00:19:14,784
What happened to the
real hula dancer,
Mike?

476
00:19:14,784 --> 00:19:16,786
Well, there was
a contract dispute.

477
00:19:16,786 --> 00:19:18,755
She wanted one.

478
00:19:18,755 --> 00:19:20,924
I bet the
audience was a
little disappointed.

479
00:19:20,924 --> 00:19:22,258
Yeah!

480
00:19:22,258 --> 00:19:24,093
They all boo'ed
and hissed me,

481
00:19:24,093 --> 00:19:27,096
and then one smart guy
came at me with a weed whacker.

482
00:19:28,498 --> 00:19:29,566
Oh, boy.

483
00:19:29,566 --> 00:19:31,100
I hope you didn't
let him get away
with that.

484
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,469
Oh no, I sent him a
very clear message.

485
00:19:33,469 --> 00:19:35,405
But in keeping with
the Hawaiian motif,

486
00:19:35,405 --> 00:19:37,473
I said it all
with my hands.
Very good.

487
00:19:37,473 --> 00:19:39,943
Actually it was
just one finger.
Okay, okay.

488
00:19:39,943 --> 00:19:41,444
All right.
Away you go,
away you go.

489
00:19:41,444 --> 00:19:42,645
Away you go down
to the meeting.

Away you go.
Away you go.

491
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,249
Better get that off,
it's crab grass season.

492
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:48,751
More trouble, Red.
What?

493
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:51,154
You had a misunderstanding
with the girl singer.

494
00:19:51,154 --> 00:19:53,556
The one related
to Don Ho?
Yeah, no.

495
00:19:53,556 --> 00:19:55,658
That was only your
interpretation.

496
00:19:55,658 --> 00:19:59,696
The message
said she's a ho.

[ CREAKING SOUND ]

498
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:04,267
Oh, I think
that big oak's going
to fall in the lake.

499
00:20:04,267 --> 00:20:06,402
Ah, doesn't matter.
It won't hurt anybody.

500
00:20:06,402 --> 00:20:07,804
Except Harold.

501
00:20:07,804 --> 00:20:09,305
He's still out there
on that surfboard!

502
00:20:09,305 --> 00:20:11,174
Yeah, but the tree's
not going to hit him.

503
00:20:11,174 --> 00:20:13,276
No, but the
tidal wave might!

[ HUGE CRASH AND SPLASHING ]

Oh, man!

506
00:20:18,848 --> 00:20:20,216
Surf's up!

507
00:20:20,783 --> 00:20:22,652

Meeting time.
Yeah, I think Harold's
already down there.

511
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:39,969
Okay, if my wife
is watching,

512
00:20:39,969 --> 00:20:42,472
I'll be coming straight home
after the meeting,

513
00:20:42,472 --> 00:20:44,974
and I'm going to try and
keep the luau going.

514
00:20:44,974 --> 00:20:47,076
I'm hoping you'll have
a little milkshake,

515
00:20:47,076 --> 00:20:51,047
or as they call it in Hawaii,
a tiny muu-muu.

516

And to the rest of
you thanks for watching.

On behalf of myself
and Harold

and the whole gang
up here at Possum Lodge,

Bow your head

I guess.

531

Okay, men.

532
00:21:29,352 --> 00:21:31,020
We're going to abandon the
Hawaiian thing

533
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,356
and we're going for
a Jamaican theme,

534
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:37,159
because we got the pork,
and we got the jerk.
