Well, it, uh --
interesting.

300
00:14:15,085 --> 00:14:18,656
A lot of people carry frying
pans in their coveralls
apparently.

301
00:14:18,656 --> 00:14:21,425
Hence the gas shortage,
I guess.

302
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:23,894
And he had one
of those eggs that --

303
00:14:23,894 --> 00:14:25,763
oh, I see, yeah,
I remember those.

304
00:14:25,763 --> 00:14:28,065
Yeah, they've got
the pantyhose in 'em.

305
00:14:28,065 --> 00:14:32,803
He's got unusual
hobbies, Bill has.

306
00:14:32,803 --> 00:14:36,840
He carries pantyhose in eggs
right next to the frying pan.

307
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,178
That is something for you
young people to stay away from,

308
00:14:41,178 --> 00:14:43,213
I would say,
on a regular basis.

309
00:14:43,213 --> 00:14:46,784
Anyway, what he lacks in brains
he makes up for in quantity.

310
00:14:46,784 --> 00:14:48,886
He's got quite a few
of those units in there,

311
00:14:48,886 --> 00:14:51,789
and they just
seem to keep on --

312
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:54,358
yeah, yeah,
they keep on comin'.

313
00:14:54,358 --> 00:14:58,796
Oh boy, he may be into his
personal collection
at this point.

314
00:14:58,796 --> 00:15:01,565
I guess you're startin'
to get the idea here.

315
00:15:01,565 --> 00:15:03,500
And you're sayin',
What the heck?

316
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,402
I thought they
were bungee jumping.

317
00:15:05,402 --> 00:15:07,504
But this is the deal.

318
00:15:07,504 --> 00:15:10,207
See, what he's got here,
rather than spending $100
on a bungee cord,

319
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:13,343
Bill would rather buy 100
pairs of $2 pantyhose, see?

320
00:15:13,343 --> 00:15:16,013
That's the kind of logic --
'course he's using my money.

321
00:15:16,013 --> 00:15:17,781
Gonna tie them
all together.

322
00:15:17,781 --> 00:15:20,083
One knot, a real
good test of your knots.

323
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,386
That's a reef knot
for you young folks.

324
00:15:22,386 --> 00:15:25,055
So he's tied about
150 pairs or so,

325
00:15:25,055 --> 00:15:26,857
100 pairs or
something together,

326
00:15:26,857 --> 00:15:29,993
and now I've -- he wants me
to tie that around the ankles.

327
00:15:29,993 --> 00:15:31,829
That's a very
important part.

328
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:34,097
This is where you really
need a decent knot here.

329
00:15:34,097 --> 00:15:37,601
I was a little bit worried,

330
00:15:37,601 --> 00:15:39,703
but not nearly as much
as I would have been

331
00:15:39,703 --> 00:15:42,573
if it had been
me goin' over the edge.

332
00:15:42,573 --> 00:15:44,575
Yeah, we see you,
Bill, yeah.

333
00:15:44,575 --> 00:15:48,345
I hope they're rated
about 180-pound test.

334
00:15:48,345 --> 00:15:52,416
You know, one size
jumps all, kinda deal.

335
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:55,285
So while I'm goin' back
to tie that thing to a tree,

336
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:57,754
Bill, he's kinda
hyperactive,

337
00:15:57,754 --> 00:15:59,923
he's gotta move himself
closer to the edge.

338
00:15:59,923 --> 00:16:01,892
Be careful there, Bill.
It's not completely level.

339
00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:04,628
It's kinda --
there's an angle.

340
00:16:04,628 --> 00:16:07,497
Yeah, that's an angle.
You might fall.

341
00:16:07,497 --> 00:16:10,033
I didn't notice
this right off.

342
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:12,703
I thought it's odd
that the cord's goin' out,

343
00:16:12,703 --> 00:16:14,338
but I'm not gonna
pay that much --

344
00:16:14,338 --> 00:16:16,640
all of a sudden, boy,
she really started
flyin' out there.

345
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,942
Then I grab it, coz I gotta
stop it coz I know
what's goin' on.

346
00:16:18,942 --> 00:16:21,478
Oh my gosh,
he's a heavy fella,

347
00:16:21,478 --> 00:16:23,480
and something's
gotta stop me.

348
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,916
There we go.

349
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,851
Then he bounces back up
and I get a bit of a break,

350
00:16:27,851 --> 00:16:29,619
but of course
what I didn't realise,

351
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:32,356
he goes back down on that.

352
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:34,224
And I mean, I try to
be a patient person,

353
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:38,095
but you know, you can tire
of a hobby in a big hurry.

354
00:16:38,095 --> 00:16:40,864
And I'm thinkin' I'll
just start pullin' him up.

355
00:16:40,864 --> 00:16:43,133
So I start and a
little bit of this,

356
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:45,235
There's a lot of weight on that,
and then you've got the leverage

357
00:16:45,235 --> 00:16:47,037
and the mechanical
advantage and all.

358
00:16:47,037 --> 00:16:48,705

really kicks in,

00:21:01,757 --> 00:21:04,460
AND UNTIL THE DAY SHE
DIED SHE COULDN'T STAND

453
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,530
TO HAVE RUSSIAN
DRESSING ON HER SALAD.

WELL, I'LL TELL YA,
THIS POSSUM LODGE PETTING ZOO

460
00:21:34,223 --> 00:21:36,993
IS A REAL LEARNING
EXPERIENCE FOR US.

461
00:21:36,993 --> 00:21:40,596
WE LEARNED FIRST OF ALL,
DON'T EVER START A
PETTING ZOO.

462
00:21:40,596 --> 00:21:44,267
AND SECONDLY, DON'T
EVER HAVE GUYS DRESSED

IN WITH REAL HORSES.

SURE THEY'RE GELDINGS.

465
00:21:53,576 --> 00:21:56,512
THE HORSES
OR THE GUYS?

I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY
CALL THIS "FUN FUR."

00:22:07,623 --> 00:22:09,859
I THOUGHT YOU
LIKED PETTING ZOOS.
