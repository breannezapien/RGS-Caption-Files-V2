1
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:03,737
YOU KNOW,
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE

2
00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:05,538
I LIKE TO DO A LITTLE FEATURE
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE MAYBE

3
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:07,774
A LITTLE LESS FORTUNATE
THAN THE REST OF US.

4
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:10,410
FOR EXAMPLE, PUMPKIN
CARVING IS A LOT OF FUN,

5
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:12,011
BUT WHAT IF YOU'RE
ONE OF THOSE GUYS

6
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:14,013
WHO'S NOT ALLOWED
TO HAVE SHARP OBJECTS?

7
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,915
WELL, HERE'S WHAT YOU DO...

8
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:17,984
FIRST I TAKE
THIS GLUE STICK.

9
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:20,487
THEN I JUST
DRAW A SCARY FACE

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,622
RIGHT ONTO THE PUMPKIN.

11
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,025
NO HARM THERE.
JUST KEEP THE GLUE
AWAY FROM YOUR FACE.

12
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,461
AND DON'T INHALE.

13
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:30,396
THERE WE GO.

14
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,700
OKAY, NOW YOU JUST
EMPTY A FEW SHOTGUN SHELLS

15
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:37,036
TO MAKE A HARMLESS
LITTLE PILE OF GUNPOWDER.

16
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,310
NOW ALL YOU DO IS ROLL OL'
PUMPKIN HEAD FACE DOWN
INTO THE GUNPOWDER.

17
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:48,081
AND YOU'LL FIND THAT IT ONLY
STICKS WHERE YOU PUT THE GLUE.

18
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:51,251
OKAY, NOW ALL'S YOU
HAVE TO DO IS THE CARVING.

19
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:53,219
YOU MAY NOT WANNA STAND
TOO CLOSE FOR THIS PART,

20
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,421
UNLESS YOU'RE REAL
TIRED OF YOUR FACIAL HAIR.

21
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,903
[ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]

22
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:14,507
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

23
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:24,417
ALL RIGHT. APPRECIATE THAT.

24
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,686
A LOT OF PEOPLE DROPPED
BY THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

25
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,655
I WAS KINDA HOPING THEY MIGHT
STAY OVER A NIGHT OR TWO,

26
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:30,556
BUT THEY WERE JUST
STOPPING TO ASK DIRECTIONS

27
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,992
TO THE NEW PROVINCIAL PARK
UP BY PORT ASBESTOS.

28
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:34,927
THEY'RE JAMMED
TO THE EYEBALLS;

29
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:36,863
WE GOT NOBODY!

30
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,631
BOY, IT'S FRUSTRATING
WHEN THE GOVERNMENT

31
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:41,234
USES YOUR OWN MONEY
TO COMPETE WITH YOU.

32
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,237
MAKES ME FEEL A LOT BETTER
ABOUT NOT PAYING MY TAXES,
I TELL YOU.

33
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,740
UNCLE RED,

34
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:51,377
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

35
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,946
I GOT A QUESTION.
WHAT'S THE EXACT WORDING
ON YOUR BIRTH CERTIFICATE?

36
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,816
MALE -- WHAT IS
IT ON YOURS?

37
00:01:56,883 --> 00:02:00,086
IS THIS HOW YOU
SPELL YOUR FULL NAME?

38
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,056
I DON'T KNOW.
I'VE NEVER WRITTEN IT.

39
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,757
WHAT IS THAT
ANYWAY, HAROLD?

40
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,459
THIS? OH, IT'S NOTHING.
IT'S NOTHING.

41
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,194
JUST A LITTLE
CRAZY IDEA I HAD.

42
00:02:08,227 --> 00:02:09,929
DO YOU MIND
SIGNING THE BOTTOM?

43
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:12,065
THIS ISN'T LIKE
AN APPLICATION TO
TURN THE LODGE

44
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:13,566
INTO A CHESS CLUB
OR SOMETHING, IS IT?

45
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,168
HA! NO, NO, NO.

46
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:17,403
PROVINCIAL PARK.

47
00:02:17,703 --> 00:02:19,505
YEAH, THE ONE IN PORT
ASBESTOS IS WORKING SO WELL

48
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,274
THE GOVERNMENT'S LOOKING TO
OPEN ONE IN OUR AREA, MAYBE.

49
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,143
WELL, WE'D BE PERFECT
AS A PROVINCIAL PARK.

50
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,212
I MEAN, WE'RE IN
A PROVINCE,

51
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,314
AND WE GOT
PLACES TO PARK.

52
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:29,816
THEY MAY WANT TO
MAKE A FEW CHANGES,

53
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:31,384
LIKE TEAR DOWN THE LODGE

54
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,985
AND RUN THE WATER THROUGH A
SEWAGE TREATMENT FACILITY.

55
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,620
BUT THAT'S
ABOUT ALL, I THINK.

56
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,522
TEAR DOWN
THE LODGE!

57
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,524
I'M NOT LETTING THEM
DO ANYTHING TO THE LODGE.

58
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,527
THEY'VE ALLOCATED
$15 MILLION FOR
THE PROJECT!

59
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,429
WELL, GO! GO! GO!

60
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,573
IT'S TIME FOR THE
POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

61
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:57,276
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

62
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,348
TODAY'S WINNER WILL
RECEIVE A COUPON

63
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:05,084
FOR A FREE WASH, WAX
BUFF, SHINE AND LUBE JOB

64
00:03:05,117 --> 00:03:07,553
FROM THE POSSUM LAKE
FITNESS CLUB!

65
00:03:09,922 --> 00:03:11,691
OKAY, MR. GREEN --
COVER YOUR EARS.

66
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:14,527
YOU'VE GOT 30 SECONDS TO GET
DALTON TO SAY THIS WORD...

67
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,231
YEAH, OKAY,
MIKE.

68
00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:20,466
AND... GO!

69
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,101
ALL RIGHT, DALTON,
THIS IS EASY.

70
00:03:22,134 --> 00:03:24,136
IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT SOMEBODY IS SAYING,

71
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:25,304
YOU TELL THEM
TO SPEAK...

72
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:28,074
ENGLISH!

73
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,244
OKAY, OKAY, WHEN YOU'RE
PLAYING BASEBALL SOMEBODY
WILL YELL, YOU'RE...

74
00:03:32,311 --> 00:03:34,513
OUT.

75
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,749
NO, I MEAN THIS IS
YOUR TURN AT BAT.

76
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,584
SO WHAT DO YOUR
TEAMMATES SAY?

77
00:03:38,617 --> 00:03:41,587
OH, NO.

78
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,589
OKAY, OKAY.

79
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:47,360
DALTON, THE VERY FIRST THING
YOU DID THIS MORNING
WAS TO GET...

80
00:03:47,426 --> 00:03:50,496
YELLED AT BY ANN MARIE.

81
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,898
YEAH, BUT AFTER
THAT YOU GOT...

82
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:55,868
THE HECK OUTTA THE HOUSE.

83
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,436
GO ANOTHER
WAY WITH IT.

84
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,672
WHAT'S THE OPPOSITE
OF BEING DOWN?

85
00:03:59,705 --> 00:04:02,742
BEING SINGLE.

86
00:04:02,808 --> 00:04:04,510
UH, YOU'RE ALMOST
OUTTA TIME, MR. GREEN.

87
00:04:04,543 --> 00:04:05,978
OKAY, YOU HEAR
THAT, DALTON?

88
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:07,613
TIME'S ALMOST...

89
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:09,048
ALMOST...

90
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,783
GONE!
TIME'S ALMOST GONE!

91
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,585
HURRY UP!

92
00:04:12,651 --> 00:04:14,386
THERE WE GO!

93
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,027
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT
PORTION OF THE SHOW.

94
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:23,762
THIS IS WHERE WE ADDRESS
THOSE THREE LITTLE WORDS

95
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,664
MEN FIND SO HARD TO SAY...

96
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:28,067
audience:
I DON'T KNOW!

97
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:30,836
YES, YOU DO,
'CAUSE THAT'S THEM.

98
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:35,074
OKAY, UM, TODAY'S
LETTER GOES AS FOLLOWS...

99
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,312
"DEAR EXPERTS --"
LA LA LA.

100

"DEAR EXPERTS, NOW
THAT I'M OLDER,

101

"I'VE NOTICED THAT
CERTAIN PARTS OF MY BODY

102

"DON'T FUNCTION AS
WELL AS THEY USED TO."

103
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:48,087
AH, FOR GOD --

104
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:55,394
"MY WIFE SAYS THERE'S NO SHAME
IN SEEKING MEDICAL ASSISTANCE,

"SHOULD I GET
A HEARING AID?
SIGNED, PHIL."

107
00:05:04,436 --> 00:05:07,706
IT'S OKAY.
HE JUST WANTS TO
GET A HEARING AID.

108
00:05:07,773 --> 00:05:10,109
DOES THAT HELP?

109
00:05:11,143 --> 00:05:12,511
IT'S FOR HIS EARS!

110
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,446
WHAT?

111
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,250
ALL RIGHT, YEAH, SURE,
YOU CAN GET A HEARING AID,
IF YOU WANT TO.

112
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:20,419
BUT IF YOU'RE
A MIDDLE-AGED GUY,

113
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,088
YOU KNOW, LIKE HOW MUCH
ARE YOU REALLY MISSING?

114
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,790
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

115
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:27,059
WELL, AT OUR AGE NOBODY
COMES UP AND SAYS STUFF LIKE,

116
00:05:27,092 --> 00:05:29,828
WOW! NICE ABS.

117
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:32,931
OR, WHERE'D YOU LEARN
TO PLAY GUITAR LIKE THAT?

118
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:36,035
OR, UH, WHAT DO YOU
THINK ABOUT ANYTHING?

119
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:39,538
YEAH, I AGREE
WITH RED.

120
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,840
I RECOMMEND SOMETHING
CALLED SELECTIVE HEARING.

121
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:44,009
YOU ONLY HEAR WHAT
YOU WANNA HEAR.

122
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:45,944
OH, THAT'S A
GREAT THEORY.

123
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:47,479
THAT'S A
TERRIBLE THEORY!

124
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,847
THANKS, RED.

125
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,049
PHIL, GET A HEARING AID.

126
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:54,153
IT'S IMPORTANT TO COMMUNICATE
YOUR EMOTIONS AND THOUGHTS
TO YOUR LOVED ONES.

127
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:56,488
YOU GOTTA STAY
IN THE LOOP.

128
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,024
THAT'S WHAT THE
HANG MAN USED TO SAY.

129
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:03,562
OKAY, LOOK, I YOU'RE
JUST KIDDING AROUND,

130
00:06:03,595 --> 00:06:05,864
BUT DO HOPE YOU'LL GET
HEARING AIDS IF THE
TIME COMES.

131
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:08,367
WELL, I THINK
IF MY HEARING GOES,

132
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,269
I MAY GET A HEARING AID.

133
00:06:10,302 --> 00:06:12,805
BUT, HAROLD, IF YOU GO,
I WILL DEFINITELY GET ONE.

134
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,009
YOU KNOW, THERE HAVE BEEN
A LOT OF GREAT INVENTIONS

135
00:06:17,075 --> 00:06:18,610
OVER THE LAST 100 YEARS...

136
00:06:18,677 --> 00:06:20,779
THE SPLITTING OF THE ATOM,
POLIO VACCINE.

137
00:06:20,846 --> 00:06:24,283
BUT THE GREATEST ONE HAS TO
BE THE DRIVE-THRU RESTAURANT.

138
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:26,318
MAN, IF I COULD'VE TOLD MY
GREAT-GRANDFATHER

139
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,020
THAT THE DAY WOULD COME
WHEN THEY COULD STUFF

140
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:30,956
A HOT MEAL IN A BAG AND
TOSS IT IN YOUR CAR WINDOW,

141
00:06:30,989 --> 00:06:34,092
HE'D JUST SHAKE HIS HEAD.

142
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:37,029
BUT I'M THINKING IT'S MAYBE
TIME TO TAKE IT TO THE
NEXT LEVEL.

143
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:39,498
INSTEAD OF A
DRIVE-THRU RESTAURANT,

144
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,900
WHERE YOU HAVE
TO GO WHERE THE FOOD IS,

145
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:44,002
WHICH CAN BE HUMILIATING
IF YOU'RE, SAY, ON FOOT,

146
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,939
OR WORSE STILL,
RIDING A BICYCLE.

147
00:06:47,005 --> 00:06:49,341
I SUGGEST A
DRIVE-TO RESTAURANT,

148
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:52,544
WHERE THE FOOD ACTUALLY
DRIVES TO WHERE YOU ARE.

149
00:06:52,878 --> 00:06:54,746
AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING
ABOUT PLAIN OLD DELIVERY,

150
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:57,916
WHERE ALL YOU GET IS SOGGY
FRIES AND LUKEWARM ATTITUDE.

151
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,019
I MEAN AN ACTUAL
KITCHEN ON WHEELS.

152
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,188
IT'S A MILLION-DOLLAR IDEA

153
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:06,258
THAT YOU CAN MAKE
OUT OF A $40 CAR.

154
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,360
NOW, SINCE WE'RE
TALKING TAKEOUT,

155
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,629
WE GOTTA START BY
TAKING OUT A FEW THINGS...

156
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:12,998
LIKE THESE SEATS.

157
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:16,301
NOW, IF YOU END UP USING
A LUXURY VEHICLE WITH
HEATED CUSHIONS,

158
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,170
YOU MIGHT THINK
ABOUT KEEPING THEM.

159
00:07:18,236 --> 00:07:20,305
THEY MAKE GREAT
BUN WARMERS.

160
00:07:23,608 --> 00:07:25,510
OKAY, NOW THAT
THE SEATS ARE GONE,

161
00:07:25,544 --> 00:07:27,913
THE ONLY OTHER THING
I HAVE TO LOSE IS THE ROOF,

162
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:30,148
IF YOU DON'T COUNT
MY CREDIBILITY --

163
00:07:30,182 --> 00:07:32,951
AND I'M SURE YOU DON'T.

164
00:07:32,984 --> 00:07:35,554
OKAY, JUST GOTTA GET
THIS OUTTA THE WIND HERE.

165
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:44,329
OKAY, NOT QUITE SURE
WHAT HAPPENED THERE.

166
00:07:44,396 --> 00:07:47,332
MUST'VE BLACKED OUT.
THE ROOF IS MISSING.

167
00:07:47,365 --> 00:07:49,101
[ SOUND LIKE BOMB WHISTLING ]

168
00:07:51,603 --> 00:07:53,572
OH, THERE IT IS.

169
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:57,442
OKAY, NOW THE NEXT STEP IS
TO INSTALL OUR GRILL HERE.

170
00:07:57,476 --> 00:08:00,545
IT ONLY MAKES SENSE TO BE
COOKING OUR BURGERS
ON A BARBEQUE,

171
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:04,716
BUT WE'RE GONNA ACTUALLY TIE
IT IN TO THE FUEL LINE
OF THE CAR.

172
00:08:04,783 --> 00:08:07,319
I'M NOT GOING TO NEED
THIS PROPANE TANK.

173
00:08:07,385 --> 00:08:09,988
[ EXPLOSION ]

174
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:13,024
LOOKED EMPTY.

175
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:15,494
OKAY, BARBEQUE'S GOING TO
TAKE CARE OF THE BURGERS
AND HOT DOGS,

176
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:17,128
BUT FOR THE FRENCH FRIES,

177
00:08:17,195 --> 00:08:19,364
I NEED SOMETHING THAT
WILL HOLD LOT MORE GREASE.

178
00:08:19,397 --> 00:08:21,433
AND I DON'T MEAN
HAROLD'S COMB.

179
00:08:25,303 --> 00:08:27,839
HOW ABOUT THE TANK FROM
AN OLD OIL FURNACE, HUH?

180
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:29,341
AND THE BEAUTY
OF THESE BABIES IS

181
00:08:29,374 --> 00:08:31,977
THE LONGER'S SHE'S BEEN THERE,
THE EASIER IT IS TO DETACH.

182
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:44,522
OKAY, NOW,
FOR YOUR FRENCH FRIES,

183
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:47,993
YOU REALLY WANNA HAVE
THOSE PRE-CUT BEFORE
YOU HIT THE ROAD.

184
00:08:48,026 --> 00:08:49,761
YOU COULD SLICE
'EM BY HAND,

185
00:08:49,828 --> 00:08:52,864
BUT FOR A JOB THIS BIG,
I PREFER SOMETHING A
LITTLE FASTER,

186
00:08:52,897 --> 00:08:55,767
LIKE, SAY, A WOOD CHIPPER.

187
00:09:02,374 --> 00:09:04,175
NOW WE'RE COOKIN', HUH?

188
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:06,444
I'VE CYCLED THE ENGINE OIL
THROUGH THE FRYER,

189
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:08,713
SO THE SAME OIL THAT
KEEP THE ENGINE COOL

190
00:09:08,747 --> 00:09:11,282
KEEPS THE FRYER HOT.

191
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:12,717
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING,

192
00:09:12,784 --> 00:09:14,919
IF YOU WANT THOSE GOLDEN
FRIES EVERYBODY LOVES,

193
00:09:14,986 --> 00:09:17,155
10-W-30.

194
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:19,457
I'VE EVEN GOT
THESE FRYER BASKETS,

195
00:09:19,491 --> 00:09:21,559
WHICH YOU CAN GET
FROM ANY GROCERY STORE.

196
00:09:21,593 --> 00:09:24,796
ATTENTION, SHOPPERS:
YOUR FRIES ARE READY.

197
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:28,233
MEANWHILE, UP FRONT,
OUR BURGERS ARE PIPING HOT,

198
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:31,202
PERFECTLY BROILED, ALL READY
FOR OUR PREP STATION.

199
00:09:33,538 --> 00:09:35,607
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,

200
00:09:35,673 --> 00:09:38,076
WHY NOT FILL THE CAR
RADIATOR WITH HOT COFFEE

201
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:41,913
AND THE HOOK IT UP TO A TAP
MOUNTED RIGHT HERE ON THE
DASHBOARD, HUH?

202
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,581
OH, YEAH.

203
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,521
OKAY, I MAY HAVE JUST ANSWERED
MY OWN QUESTION THERE.

204
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:53,057
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

205
00:09:53,124 --> 00:09:55,026
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

206
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:57,128
NOW, IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME,

207
00:09:57,195 --> 00:09:59,564
I'VE GOT A
HUNGRY TOWN TO FEED.

ARE LITTLE VAGUE

00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:27,792
ABOUT WHEN EXACTLY
MIDDLE AGE BEGINS.

211
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:30,161
IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOUR CHRONOLOGICAL AGE.

212
00:10:30,194 --> 00:10:32,130
DOESN'T MATTER IF
YOUR HAIR HAS GONE GREY,

213
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:34,933
GONE WHITE OR
GONE AWOL.

214
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:37,335
YOU HAVE OFFICIALLY
ARRIVED AT MID-LIFE

215
00:10:37,368 --> 00:10:40,405
WHEN THE MOST IMPORTANT
ASPECT OF ANY ACTIVITY

216
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:43,141
IS COMFORT.

217

EXCITEMENT, ADVENTURE,

A BACK SEAT TO COMFORT.

YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT PHYSICAL FITNESS.

YOU WANT HEATING AND
AIR CONDITIONING.

221

YOU WANT PADDING,

222
00:10:56,721 --> 00:10:58,289
ON YOUR FURNITURE,
ON YOUR PAYCHEQUE,

223
00:10:58,356 --> 00:11:00,958
ON YOUR OWN BUTT.

224
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:03,094

IS AFFECTED.

225

COMFORTABLE RELATIONSHIP,

YOU KNOW, WHERE NOBODY
YELLS AT ANYBODY,

228
00:11:09,534 --> 00:11:11,202
WHERE NOTHING CHANGES,

229
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:12,970
AND NINE TIMES OUTTA TEN,

230
00:11:13,004 --> 00:11:15,540
YOU FALL ASLEEP
BEFORE YOUR WIFE DOES.

YOUR WILD OATS HAVE
TURNED INTO WILD OAT BRAN.

00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:23,514
YOU MAY EVENTUALLY
GET TO THE POINT

234

AND SAY, HEY, THIS IS
AS GOOD AS I GET,

BE GRATEFUL FOR THAT.

EVERYBODY OFF,

QUALIFY FOR THE FULL
