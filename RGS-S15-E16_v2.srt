00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:03,703
You know, back
when I was a kid

2
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:05,905
everybody wanted
to be a cowboy

3
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:08,608
like Hop-a-Long Cassidy
or Roy Rogers

4
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:10,043
or even Gene Autrey

5
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:12,011
until he sang that
Christmas song.

6
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:14,414

was wearing the cap guns.

Of course this was before
airport security.

8
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:19,986
But these cowboys like
me are the same ones

9
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:22,055
who refuse to
wear seatbelts.

10
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:23,590
To them it looks wussy.

11
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,659
If a cowboy can ride
a mustang across the
desert without one

12
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:30,630
then you should be able
to drive a Pinto to the
mall without one.

13

So we have to find a way

00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:36,169
to make seatbelts part
of the cowboy experience.

into a pretend ammo. belt.

so the Earth doesn't
fry up like burrito.

You know what I
think is amazing

is that you have a hobby
that is so far removed

165

from what you do
for a living.

far removed.

in the life of any appliance

00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,149
when it's over.

171

And then that time
comes you'll know.

172
00:08:09,554 --> 00:08:11,189
But what do you do when
you have an old fridge

173
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:13,191
and stove that the
garbage men won't take

and you don't live
next to a ravine.

175
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,796
Well I guess if you're
real good with a can opener,

176
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:20,398
you could get rid of them
a little bit at a time

177
00:08:20,398 --> 00:08:22,701

a handyman
with a teenager,

179
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:25,937
here's what you can do.

180
00:08:25,937 --> 00:08:32,477
Step one, take the
top off the stove.

181
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:40,485
Step one, take the
back off the stove.

182
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:46,057
Take the door off
the stove.

183
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:48,159
Then you remove
the top and back

184
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:50,528
because once you get
the top and the back
off the unit,

185
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:52,631
this is no longer a stove,

186
00:08:52,631 --> 00:08:56,167
it's an office chair for
your teenager's workstation.

187
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:58,436
Got a fully-reclining backrest,

188

It's so hard to tell
with kids these days.

191
00:09:05,043 --> 00:09:06,978
And here's an extra bonus,

192
00:09:06,978 --> 00:09:09,581
retractable foot rest

193

carpel tunnel in his butt.

194

But how's he going to know
when his homework is done?

195
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:18,256
Well that's what this
homework timer is for.

Just set it to well done.

197
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:23,862
And for extra safety
and comfort,

198
00:09:23,862 --> 00:09:28,733
I would suggest you
line the whole unit
with an air mattress

199
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:33,805
because I believe there
could be an exposed
sharp edge or two...

200
00:09:33,805 --> 00:09:35,807
and I'm right.

201
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:37,375
Now here's a question.

202
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:46,551
Can I rig up these burners
to make a red, hot,
reading light?

203
00:09:47,218 --> 00:09:50,989
No.

204
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:53,958
You know it's good
for a teenager to
sit in a stove

205
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,294
because you want him
in the hot seat

206
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:59,230
but you also want
him to be cool

207
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:03,067
so this fridge becomes
his computer desk

208
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:05,336
and that automatic
fridge light means

209
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:09,140
you don't need any of those
goofy-looking desk lamps.

kept horiontal

for holding my files

handle all your office supplies.

You know what,
you can adopt.

318
00:15:24,888 --> 00:15:26,824
So Mike and Ed get into
kind of an argument.

319
00:15:26,824 --> 00:15:29,860
Bill's saying, why are
you arguing in nature's
beautiful environment?

320
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,196
Bill pulls out a telescope

321
00:15:32,196 --> 00:15:34,198
and he just says,
it's just so beautiful.

322
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:37,167
Why don't you just enjoy
nature for all it is.

323
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:38,602
That's fine, he's right.

324
00:15:38,602 --> 00:15:40,470
Just enjoy the day.

325
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,905
There's some bugs there.

326
00:15:41,905 --> 00:15:45,209
You know, you get the
black flies and mosquitoes

327
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:47,511
and the deer flies.

328
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:48,912
This is getting crazy here

329
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:51,348
so they're slamming away
on each other and --

330
00:15:51,348 --> 00:15:55,185
Now Ed has some kind of
an insect repellent

331
00:15:55,185 --> 00:15:56,620
or something that's he got.

332
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,722
These two are --

333
00:15:58,722 --> 00:16:00,490

No, no, come on now.
Come on, now.

335

Easy now, come on now.

336
00:16:04,595 --> 00:16:09,066
So Ed has some type
of bug fogger and that's --

337
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:10,300
Oh boy!

338

Turn her down.

Turn her down.

340
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:14,938
But you know it,
it did the job.

341
00:16:14,938 --> 00:16:16,974
It cleared the air --
Cleared the air.

342
00:16:16,974 --> 00:16:19,376
But they come back,
that's what I find anyway.

343
00:16:19,376 --> 00:16:23,413
They come back so then
Bill says I'm going
to go pitch the tent.

344
00:16:23,413 --> 00:16:25,549
They got the screen
windows in it

345
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:27,250
and we can all get in there
and get out of the bugs.

346
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,585
It's one of these tents --

347
00:16:28,585 --> 00:16:32,255
You know you kind of flash them
and they stand up on their own.

348
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,323
Okay now get in the tent.

349

Everybody get in the tent.

In the tent, way you go.

351
00:16:35,892 --> 00:16:39,730
Get in the tent, yeah
and then zip the zipper.

352
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,631
Okay, there's a few bugs
in there but not very many

353
00:16:41,631 --> 00:16:43,400
and within a few minutes
they realize --

354
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,169
Okay, okay, they're good.

355
00:16:46,169 --> 00:16:47,070
Everything's good.

356
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,672
It's good.

357
00:16:48,672 --> 00:16:50,440
Then they feel something
coming up from underneath.

358
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:57,414
They pitched the tent
right over an ant hill.

359
00:16:57,414 --> 00:16:59,783
So now they stand up
in a tent --

360
00:16:59,783 --> 00:17:03,520
not a good idea.

361

Okay, plan B, they all
get into sleeping bags.

362
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:08,792
Bill takes his
telescope apart

363
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:10,460
and he's got
snorkles attached

364
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,262
so they can get inside,
zip themselves in

365
00:17:12,262 --> 00:17:13,363
and still be able to breathe

366
00:17:13,363 --> 00:17:17,000
just by leaving the
telescope outside.

367
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,704
What they didn't realize
is there are tarantulas

Ooh.

371
00:17:35,585 --> 00:17:38,855
Okay, so it's time for
a total rethink.

372
00:17:38,855 --> 00:17:40,423
They're going to just
get in the canoe

373
00:17:40,423 --> 00:17:41,725
and get the heck out of there

374

and for all you animal
lovers out there,

375

the tarantula is just fine.

376
00:17:46,363 --> 00:17:47,531
So they hop in the canoe

377
00:17:47,531 --> 00:17:49,132

back to the lodge,

the chemicals kind of all
glomed together and...
