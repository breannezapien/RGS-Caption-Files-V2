GOT THE ONE END AROUND THE
BOTTOM RUNG OF THE LADDER,

WANT, AS LONG AS IT'S

HE CLIPS THE OTHER ONE
WITH HIS FOOT.

305
00:15:05,369 --> 00:15:07,204
NOW THIS IS STARTIN'
TO HURT HIM.

306
00:15:07,204 --> 00:15:09,373
AND THEN...

307
00:15:09,373 --> 00:15:10,941
OH! OH!

308
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:12,342
WAIT, DON'T WE
HAVE TWO RAKES?

309
00:15:12,342 --> 00:15:14,178
OH, YEAH.

310
00:15:14,178 --> 00:15:17,147
ALL RIGHT,
LATER THAT DAY...

311
00:15:17,147 --> 00:15:18,649
I GOT THE IDEA
TO GO TO PLAN "B",

312
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:21,185
WHICH IS ONE OF THESE
STICKY RAT PADS THEY HAVE.

BABY A WHILE.

00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,223
I FIGURE IT WORKS,
AND IT'S IT SAFER.

315
00:15:26,223 --> 00:15:28,225
YOU JUST LEAVE
THE PAD LYING OUT,

316
00:15:28,225 --> 00:15:30,527
AND THE RAT GETS KINDA --
HIS FEET GET STUCK IN THERE.

317
00:15:30,527 --> 00:15:34,598
IT'S DRIED.

319
00:15:38,368 --> 00:15:40,304
IT'S A GOOD IDEA, MAYBE WE'LL
JUST BUILD OUR OWN.

320
00:15:40,304 --> 00:15:43,040
BUILD MAYBE
A BETTER MOUSETRAP --

321
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,374
OR RAT TRAP,
OR WHAT HAVE YOU,

322
00:15:44,374 --> 00:15:46,043
BY JUST POURING
OUR OWN ADHESIVE,

323
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:48,912

INTO SOME GARBAGE CAN LIDS.

324
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:51,215
THIS IS THE STRONG STUFF.

325
00:15:51,215 --> 00:15:53,984
AND YOU TAKE THAT,
LEAVE THOSE IN THE BARN

326

JUST STRATEGICALLY PLACED,

327
00:15:55,686 --> 00:15:57,221
AND THEY'RE GONNA CATCH MAYBE
SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE,

328
00:15:57,221 --> 00:15:58,555
MAYBE A THOUSAND RATS.

329
00:15:58,555 --> 00:16:00,457
OH, WHAT HAPPENED THERE?

330
00:16:00,457 --> 00:16:02,292
UH, THEY SEEM TO BE
PREOCCUPIED

331
00:16:02,292 --> 00:16:04,194
WITH SOME SORT
OF NASAL ADJUSTMENT.

332
00:16:04,194 --> 00:16:07,864
AND THEN OF COURSE THEY STEP
RIGHT INTO THE GLUE
AND FALL DOWN,

333
00:16:07,864 --> 00:16:10,500
AND THE LIDS ARE
STUCK TO THEIR FEET.

334
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,102
NOW, WALTER DIDN'T
COME OFF TOO BAD,

335
00:16:12,102 --> 00:16:13,570
'CAUSE I GOT HER
OFF RIGHT AWAY.

336
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,606
BUT YOU CAN SEE THE
ADHESION QUOTIENT THERE.

337
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:17,708
BUT JUST AN EXTRA
FEW SECONDS WAS ALL IT TOOK

338
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,344
FOR BILL'S
TO SET RIGHT IN.

339
00:16:20,344 --> 00:16:23,113
SO I'M THINKIN', WALTER,
GO AND GET THE POSSUM VAN.

340
00:16:23,113 --> 00:16:24,414
I GOT AN IDEA.

341
00:16:24,414 --> 00:16:27,017
I FIGURE IF I COULD WEDGE THAT
LID RIGHT INTO THE FLOOR,

342
00:16:27,017 --> 00:16:28,685
LIKE STRAIGHT
UP AND DOWN,

343
00:16:28,685 --> 00:16:30,921
AND THEN GET WALTER
TO BACK OVER HIM,

344
00:16:30,921 --> 00:16:32,856
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS,
I FIGURED --

345
00:16:32,856 --> 00:16:34,524
I DIDN'T REALISE HE HAD
SO MUCH GLUE ON HIS FEET.

346
00:16:34,524 --> 00:16:37,294
BUT ANYWAY, HE DID
EVENTUALLY GET THERE.

347
00:16:37,294 --> 00:16:41,098

I'LL JUST CLEAR THE AREA.

I DIDN'T REALISE WALTER'S FEET
AT THIS POINT WERE STUCK.

350
00:16:46,002 --> 00:16:48,905
SO I JUST GOT
OUTTA THERE.

351
00:16:48,905 --> 00:16:50,707
AND THEN HE WAS
RIGHT OVER BILL,

352

AWAY SHE GOES.
