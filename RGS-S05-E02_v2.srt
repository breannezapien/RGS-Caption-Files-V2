1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,274
(Engine revving)

2
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:11,678
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

3
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,213
NOW HERE'S THE MAN

4
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,049
WHO'S MADE POSSUM LODGE
WHAT IT IS TODAY,

5
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:17,550
AND STILL NO APOLOGIES,

6
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:19,085
YOUR HOST, MY UNCLE...

7
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:20,153
RED GREEN.

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,089
(Audience cheering)

9
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:24,290
(Howling)

10
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,192
(Howling)

11
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:28,428
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

12
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,029
THIS IS A BIG DAY FOR

13
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:32,365
POSSUM LAKE ROAD CONSTRUCTION.

14
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,134
THEY'RE FIXING THAT BUMP AT

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,102
THE TOP OF THE HILL INTO TOWN.

16
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:37,604
BOY, THE THINGS THAT

17
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,105
HAVE SMASHED AGAINST

18
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,207
THE INSIDE OF MY VAN THERE.

19
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:42,876
WHAT ARE THE EGGS FOR?

20
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:45,879
YOU GOING TO POSSUM LAKE
LITTLE THEATRE?

21
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:49,582
NO, I'M USING THESE
TO TEST THE BUMP.

22
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:53,620
IF I CAN DRIVE OVER
WITHOUT CRACKING THESE BABIES,

23
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:55,121
I'LL CALL IT FIXED.

24
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:56,623
HA,
GOOD IDEA.

25
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,258
WEAR
OLD CLOTHES.

26
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,360
(Horns honking)

27
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,470
(Quacking)

28
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:16,743
(Red): IN THIS SHOW, HAP
DISCUSSES HIS DAYS AS A WHALER,

29
00:01:16,809 --> 00:01:19,712
AND HAROLD AND I CHANGE PLACES.

30
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:22,682
DON'T WORRY,
IT'S NOT PERMANENT.

31
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,417
I GET DOUGIE FRANKLIN

32
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:27,654
TO SAY A WORD
HE HARDLY EVER THINKS OF.

33
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,695
WELL, I'LL HAND IT TO
THOSE CONSTRUCTION GUYS.

34
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,598
THEY TOOK 4 HOURS
TO DO A 15-MINUTE JOB,

35
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,533
BUT BETWEEN
LEANING ON SHOVELS

36
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,736
AND ROLLING SMOKES,
THEY MANAGED TO FIX THAT BUMP.

37
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:47,840
I CAN'T COMPLIMENT THE COPS
RUNNING THE RADAR TRAP.

38
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,243
EXACTLY HOW FAST
WERE YOU GOING?

39
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:52,478
'CAUSE TICKETS
CAN BE EXPENSIVE.

40
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:55,782
DID THEY SAY ANYTHING ABOUT
YOU LOSING POINTS?

41
00:01:55,848 --> 00:01:57,283
TWELVE OF THEM.

42
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,486
WOW, I DIDN'T KNOW
THE VAN COULD GO THAT FAST.

43
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,688
NO --
I LOST THREE FOR SPEEDING,

44
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:05,425
THREE FOR THE CONDITION
OF THE VEHICLE,

45
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:09,162
AND I LOST THREE FOR DRIVING
WITH AN OBSTRUCTED VIEW.

46
00:02:09,228 --> 00:02:11,497
WAIT --
THAT'S ONLY NINE POINTS.

47
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:14,801
I LOST ANOTHER THREE
FOR SPEEDING ON THE WAY BACK.

48
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:17,270
THEY LEFT HER
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.

49
00:02:17,336 --> 00:02:19,038
THEY WERE GOING TO TOW IT,

50
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,340
BUT THE CHIEF
THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE

51
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,309
THE POLICE COMPOUND LOOK BAD.

52
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,945
(Singing) UNCLE RED HAS TO GO
TO DRIVER'S SCHOOL

53
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:29,282
NO, I DON'T --
I JUST HAVE TO BE RETESTED.

54
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:32,752
BUT UNTIL THEN, I GOT
NO LICENCE AND NO WHEELS.

55
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,555
AND YET, YOU STILL HAVE
A SPARE TIRE.

56
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:42,428
(Red): WHEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM,
IT'S NICE TO HAVE FRIENDS.

57
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,430
AT LEAST YOU'D THINK THAT.

58
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,032
I DON'T HAVE MY VAN.

59
00:02:46,098 --> 00:02:50,102
SO BILL'S SUGGESTING
OTHER WAYS I CAN GET AROUND.

60
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:52,071
I'M SURE HE MEANS WELL.

61
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:55,074
HE DOESN'T DO WELL.

62
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:56,576
(Audience laughing)

63
00:02:56,642 --> 00:02:58,611
DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER IDEAS?

64
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,112
ANYTHING ELSE AT ALL?

65
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,547
OH GOOD.

66
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,786
YOU'RE INTO IT
UP TO YOUR BIG MOUTH.

67
00:03:06,852 --> 00:03:08,955
NO SOONER DO YOU START PUTTING

68
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:11,290
YOUR NEW GAS BARBECUE
TOGETHER...

69
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:15,027
YOU GET STUCK --
TAB "A" WON'T FIT IN SLOT "B".

70
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:18,297
SHE SAYS,
"WHAT DO THE INSTRUCTIONS SAY?"

71
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,801
(Audience laughing)

72
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:24,303
NOW YOU'RE REALLY STUCK.

73
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,307
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T READ
THE INSTRUCTIONS, HAVE YA?

74
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,010
THEY'RE SEALED IN
A LITTLE PLASTIC BAG

75
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,812
THAT YOU'RE KNEELING ON.

76
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:34,313
(Audience laughing)

77
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,315
TIME TO THINK FAST.

78
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,551
SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT GOOD AT

79
00:03:38,617 --> 00:03:41,320
OR YOU WOULDN'T BE CURSING
TAB "A".

80
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,222
TRY SAYING YOU WERE

81
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:46,392
TRYING TO PUT IT TOGETHER
WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED

82
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,095
TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE

83
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:50,763
TO BE STEVIE WONDER.

84
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,598
THIS IS AS FAR AS YOU GOT.

85
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:54,266
PRETTY GOOD, HUH?

86
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,335
OR TELL HER YOU READ
ABOUT A GUY

87
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,437
WHO GOT A BARBECUE FROM TAIWAN.

88
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:02,274
THEY MADE A MISTAKE WHEN THEY
TRANSLATED THE INSTRUCTIONS.

89
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:04,276
THE WHOLE THING EXPLODED.

90
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:06,112
BUT SAY SOMEONE GOT KILLED.

91
00:04:06,178 --> 00:04:07,780
THAT WAY IT SOUNDS REAL.

92
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,616
NEXT TIME YOU GET
SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

93
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:13,786
FIRST THING YOU DO,
FIND THE INSTRUCTIONS,

94
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,287
THROW 'EM AWAY.

95
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:18,290
YOU CAN CLAIM THAT
IT DIDN'T COME WITH ANY.

96
00:04:18,357 --> 00:04:20,793
IF THERE'S ANOTHER SET
IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE,

97
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,294
HANG ON TO THEM.

98
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:25,364
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO
LOOK AT THOSE PICTURES LATER.

99
00:04:26,249 --> 00:04:28,249
(Strums guitar)

100
00:04:29,134 --> 00:04:32,338
IT'S SO EASY
TO FOOL YOUR SENSES

101
00:04:32,404 --> 00:04:34,139
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE
WHAT YOU SEE

102
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:35,975
BUT YOUR NOSE KNOWS
THE INSIDE STORY

103
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,476
IT CAN'T BE TRICKED BY
THE POWERS THAT BE

104
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,478
SO WHENEVER YOU
MAKE A DECISION

105
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,814
TAKE A WHIFF OF
THE AIR LIKE THIS

106
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,249
'CAUSE IT MAY
WALK LIKE A DUCK

107
00:04:43,315 --> 00:04:44,750
AND TALK LIKE A DUCK

108
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,819
BUT IF IT SMELLS
KIND OF CHEESY, IT IS

109
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,059
JUST BUILT A TABLE FOR THE WIFE

110
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:58,397
TO MAKE UP FOR THE FACT THAT
I'VE LOST MY DRIVER'S LICENCE.

111
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,000
WE CALL THAT "MERCY FURNITURE".

112
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:05,437
THIS WEEK I'LL SHOW YOU
HOW YOU CAN BEAT RADAR TRAPS.

113
00:05:05,504 --> 00:05:06,839
THAT WAY YOU CAN AVOID

114
00:05:06,905 --> 00:05:09,708
THE EMBARRASSMENT
THAT I HAVE TO PUT UP WITH,

115
00:05:09,775 --> 00:05:11,210
OR AT LEAST SOME OF IT.

116
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:13,112
THE WAY RADAR WORKS IS

117
00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:15,114
A BEAM COMES FLYING
TOWARDS YOUR CAR,

118
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,018
BOUNCES OFF SOMETHING METAL,
HEADS BACK TO THE COP CAR,

119
00:05:19,084 --> 00:05:22,788
TELLS THEM HOW MUCH YOU'RE
EXCEEDING THE SPEED LIMIT.

120
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:26,492
HE PULLS YOU OVER
AND GIVES YOU THAT $200 SMILE.

121
00:05:26,558 --> 00:05:28,327
SO, YOU HAVE TO CONTROL

122
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:31,196
WHAT PART OF YOUR CAR
THE RADAR HITS.

123
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,366
WHAT WE DO IS
WE TAKE A PIECE OF FOAM,

124
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:37,803
OR A BOX OF CHOCOLATES
OR A BOX OF CEREAL,

125
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,306
OR ANY BOOK BY DICKENS,
AND WRAP THAT WITH WIRE,

126
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:45,244
THEN WE'LL HOOK THE WIRE
UP TO THIS NINE-VOLT BATTERY.

127
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,613
THIS IS WHAT WILL ATTRACT
THE RADAR.

128
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:51,250
SIMILAR TO THE TECHNOLOGY
USED IN THAT STEALTH BOMBER,

129
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:52,785
EXCEPT IN REVERSE.

130
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:55,888
AND A COUPLE OF DOLLARS CHEAPER
I BELIEVE.

131
00:06:06,832 --> 00:06:08,300
THERE WE GO.

132
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:12,704
THIS WILL ATTRACT EVERY PIECE
OF RADAR IN YOUR NEIGHBOURHOOD.

133
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:15,307
YOU'LL BE PICKED UP BY
SHIPS AT SEA.

134
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:19,077
YOU DON'T MOUNT THIS
ON YOUR CAR ANY OLD WHICH WAY.

135
00:06:19,144 --> 00:06:21,780
THIS HAS TO BE SECURED
ON A MOVING BELT,

136
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:24,283
SORT OF LIKE
MOOSE THOMPSON'S BUCKLE.

137
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:26,552
YOU COULD GO TO
YOUR GROCERY STORE

138
00:06:26,618 --> 00:06:28,353
AND PORK THE CONVEYER BELT

139
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,790
WHILE THE MANAGER'S
GETTING YOU A FRESHER CABBAGE.

140
00:06:31,857 --> 00:06:34,860
BUT, I PREFER TO USE
A LADDER AND SOME--

141
00:06:38,864 --> 00:06:41,166
BED SHEETING.

142
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:44,202
I HAVE THE SHEET
RUNNING OVER THE LADDER.

143
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:47,306
SHE'S ALSO RUNNING OVER
THIS COPPER PIPE.

144
00:06:47,372 --> 00:06:50,742
YOU CAN GET COPPER PIPE
OUT OF YOUR BASEMENT.

145
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:53,245
REMEMBER TO TURN THE WATER OFF.

146
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,080
THAT'S EASY TO SAY NOW.

147
00:06:55,147 --> 00:06:58,850
AT THE END OF THE PIPE
I'VE GOT A HUNK OF CLOTHESLINE

148
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:01,420
WRAPPED AROUND
A CLOTHESLINE PULLEY.

149
00:07:01,486 --> 00:07:04,189
THE BEAUTY OF STEALNG
A CLOTHESLINE SET

150
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:05,824
IS YOU GET TWO PULLEYS.

151
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:08,860
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO
WITH THE OTHER PULLEY?

152
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:10,595
I HOPED YOU'D NEVER ASK.

153
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:14,232
BOLT IT TO THE REAR WHEEL
OF YOUR FAVOURITE VEHICLE.

154
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:17,669
TAKE THE CLOTHESLINE,
HOOK THAT ON TO THE PULLEY.

155
00:07:17,736 --> 00:07:20,205
THEN THAT GOES UP
AND ATTACHES TO...

156
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:21,707
OUR BELT.

157
00:07:21,773 --> 00:07:23,442
WHEN THE CAR MOVES,

158
00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:26,645
THAT DRIVES THE PULLEY,
THAT DRIVES THE BELT,

159
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:29,614
AND THAT MOVES OUR
RADAR-ATTRACTER-THINGY

160
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:31,783
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

161
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,653
SO, IF YOU'RE GOING,
SAY, 60 MILES AN HOUR,

162
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,254
WELL, THE RADAR TRACKER

163
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:38,690
IS GOING 20 MILES AN HOUR
BACKWARDS.

164
00:07:38,757 --> 00:07:43,028
SO, THE RADAR READS IT AS
60 MINUS 20 IS...

165
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:44,830
LEGAL.

166
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:46,331
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

167
00:07:46,398 --> 00:07:49,134
WHEN THIS COMES AROUND
AND GOES UNDERNEATH,

168
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:51,603
IT'S GOING TO JAM UP
AGAINST THE ROOF.

169
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:54,239
I NEED SOMETHING
TO RAISE THE LADDER UP.

170
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:55,807
HMM?

171
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:01,746
OH, OH, OH, OH.

172
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:03,248
TELL YOU WHAT,

173
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:05,650
THIS CRAFT TABLE
WOULD BE PERFECT

174
00:08:05,717 --> 00:08:07,919
IF IT DIDN'T HAVE A TOP ON IT.

175
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:10,822
THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF
USING ONE NAIL.

176
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:12,858
(Audience laughing)

177
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:15,760
PERFECT.

178
00:08:15,827 --> 00:08:19,030
WE GOT HER ON A JACK
SO WE CAN DEMONSTRATE...

179
00:08:19,097 --> 00:08:21,466
YOU GOTTA HAVE A TWIST IN THIS.

180
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:25,270
OTHERWISE THEY'LL BE
GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION,

181
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:27,739
WHICH WILL DOUBLE YOUR SPEED.

182
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:30,609
YOU'LL GET A TICKET
FOR DOING 120.

183
00:08:30,675 --> 00:08:33,778
LET'S GIVE HER A TRY.

184
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:35,347
(Engine starting)

185
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:39,284
AND THAT'S WORKING PERFECT.

186
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:41,786
OH, OH, OH,
JUST THOUGHT OF SOMETHING.

187
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:44,856
DON'T MESS AROUND
WITH THE RATIOS OF THE PULLEY.

188
00:08:44,923 --> 00:08:47,993
OTHERWISE YOU'RE GOING
60 MILES AN HOUR FORWARD.

189
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:51,363
THE RADAR THING IS GOING
60 MILES AN HOUR BACKWARD.

190
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:54,499
THE COP WILL PULL YOU OVER
AND GIVE YOU A TICKET

191
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:56,334
FOR PARKING ON THE FREEWAY.

192
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:59,437
REMEMBER, IF WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

193
00:08:59,504 --> 00:09:01,706
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

194
00:09:01,773 --> 00:09:04,242
I'M GOING TO PUT
THE PEDAL TO THE METAL.

195
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:07,812
(Red): STAY TUNED FOR GARTH
AND HIS SNAKE.

196
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,219
LOSE YOUR CAR AND
DISCOVER WHO YOUR FRIENDS ARE.

197
00:09:14,285 --> 00:09:16,187
LODGE MEMBERS TEASING YOU?

198
00:09:16,254 --> 00:09:18,590
I CAN'T TAKE IT
FROM OLD MAN SEDGWICK.

199
00:09:18,656 --> 00:09:20,091
HE'S BLIND, HE'S DEAF.

200
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:22,394
HE'S GOT THE REFLEXES
OF A HOUSEPLANT.

201
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,462
HE'S DRIVING
A 60-FOOT MOTOR HOME.

202
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:25,930
HE'S A MENACE AT THE WHEEL.

203
00:09:25,997 --> 00:09:28,233
HE'S ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL,
HAROLD.

204
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:30,935
ASK ME QUESTIONS
FROM THE DRIVER HANDBOOK.

205
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:34,339
"WHAT'S THE PROCEDURE
FOR STOPPING AT A STOP SIGN:

206
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:36,975
"STOPPING AT THE SIGN
OR AT THE CORNER?"

207
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:40,912
WELL, IF NOBODY'S COMING,
I USUALLY SLOW DOWN TO 40,

208
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:42,781
UNLESS MY HORN'S BROKEN.

209
00:09:42,847 --> 00:09:44,282
I'LL MARK THAT AS

210
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:47,418
"I HAVE NO IDEA,
AND I JUST FAILED THE TEST."

211
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:49,420
DID YOU READ THE HANDBOOK?

212
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:52,223
HAVE YOU SEEN THE SIZE
OF THE PRINT?

213
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,758
MAYBE YOU NEED GLASSES.

214
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:55,460
MY EYES ARE FINE.

215
00:09:55,527 --> 00:09:57,395
HOW MANY FINGERS
AM I HOLDING UP?

216
00:09:57,462 --> 00:09:59,597
BETTER BE MORE THAN ONE.

217
00:09:59,664 --> 00:10:01,132
YOU NEED GLASSES.

218
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:04,235
I GOT NO WAY OF GETTING TO
THE EYE DOCTOR.

219
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:06,137
THE GUYS ARE ON THE LAKE.

220
00:10:06,204 --> 00:10:08,206
WELL, I HAVE MY LICENCE.

221
00:10:08,273 --> 00:10:10,975
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ASK...

222
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:13,144
NICELY.

223
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:16,648
OH MAN.

224
00:10:16,714 --> 00:10:22,153
HAROLD, WILL YOU DRIVE ME
TO THE EYE DOCTOR, PLEASE?

225
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,589
OK, SURE.

226
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:26,457
WHAT VEHICLE ARE WE TAKING?

227
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:28,159
I SAID I HAVE MY LICENCE.

228
00:10:28,226 --> 00:10:30,261
I DIDN'T SAY I HAVE A VEHICLE.

229
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:33,731
YOU WANT TO RIDE ON
THE HANDLEBARS OR THE RAT TRAP?

230
00:10:33,798 --> 00:10:36,567
YOU HEAR A LOT OF TALK
ABOUT POWER SAWS.

231
00:10:36,634 --> 00:10:39,604
BUT A SHARP HAND SAW
IS JUST AS EFFECTIVE.

232
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:41,339
ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO

233
00:10:41,406 --> 00:10:44,542
IS CUT A NOTCH IN YOUR WOOD,
THEN CUT A NOTCH

234
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:46,277
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

235
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:50,048
AND THEN JUST VERY QUICKLY
FINISH OFF YOUR CUT.

236
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:56,287
REMEMBER, ANY TOOL
CAN BE THE RIGHT TOOL.

237
00:10:56,354 --> 00:10:58,489
THIS IS
THE BIG ONE.

238
00:10:58,556 --> 00:11:02,126
THE GRAND PRIZE IS FOR
OVER A HUNDRED DOLLARS,

239
00:11:02,193 --> 00:11:05,129
LESS EXPENSES
AND ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF.

240
00:11:05,196 --> 00:11:07,231
UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS

241
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:09,701
TO MAKE MR. FRANKLIN SAY
THIS WORD.

242
00:11:11,135 --> 00:11:13,371
THIRTY SECONDS, AND GO.

243
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:16,174
ALL RIGHT, UH... MASCULINE.

244
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,975
CHUCK NORRIS.

245
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:19,844
OPPOSITE.

246
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:21,345
WILLARD SCOTT.

247
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:23,081
(Audience laughing)

248
00:11:23,147 --> 00:11:25,383
WOMAN.

249
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,653
MAINTENANCE.

250
00:11:30,321 --> 00:11:31,756
PERFECT WOMAN.

251
00:11:31,823 --> 00:11:34,525
EXPENSIVE?

252
00:11:34,592 --> 00:11:36,561
DOUGIE, YOU SEE A WOMAN.

253
00:11:36,627 --> 00:11:38,529
SHE'S PETITE, SHE'S PRETTY.

254
00:11:38,596 --> 00:11:40,098
YOU SAY SHE'S VERY...

255
00:11:40,164 --> 00:11:41,599
VERY...

256
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,100
NOT FROM
AROUND HERE.

257
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:45,603
(Audience laughing)

258
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,206
YOU'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME,
UNCLE RED.

259
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:51,008
I CAN'T THINK OF
ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY.

260
00:11:51,075 --> 00:11:52,510
YOU'RE SITTING THERE.

261
00:11:52,577 --> 00:11:54,545
SAY SOMETHING, ANYTHING.

262
00:11:54,612 --> 00:11:57,248
UH... ALL RIGHT...
HAROLD.

263
00:11:57,315 --> 00:11:58,716
FEMININE.

264
00:11:58,783 --> 00:12:00,618
(Bell ringing)

265
00:12:00,685 --> 00:12:04,155
(Applause)

266
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:07,458
GARTH HARBLE HERE...
ANIMAL CONTROL,

267
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:10,895
WITH ANOTHER LESSON
IN WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT.

268
00:12:10,962 --> 00:12:12,129
COME ON IN HERE, RED.

269
00:12:12,196 --> 00:12:15,132
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO YOUR LEG THERE, GARTH?

270
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:17,868
I HAD A BIT OF A RUN-IN
WITH A CARIBOU

271
00:12:17,935 --> 00:12:20,338
DOWN AT
THE ANIMAL CONTROL CENTRE.

272
00:12:20,404 --> 00:12:23,241
I HAD TO TAKE ONE
FOR THE TEAM, RED.

273
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:25,243
OH, OH,
I FORGOT SOMETHING.

274
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:26,811
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

275
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:28,346
OH, AH.

276
00:12:28,412 --> 00:12:31,248
IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS
A SHORT CARIBOU.

277
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:34,385
NO, NO --
I WAS STANDING ON MY DESK.

278
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:37,088
TODAY WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT SNAKES.

279
00:12:37,154 --> 00:12:39,824
LOTS OF CIVILIANS
ARE AFRAID OF SNAKES.

280
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,359
WE IN THE A.C. UNIFORM

281
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:44,261
KNOW THAT SNAKES
ARE BASICALLY HARMLESS...

282
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:46,597
UNLESS YOU STEP IN THEIR NEST.

283
00:12:46,664 --> 00:12:49,500
I'LL NEVER FORGET
THAT TRIP TO THE HOSPITAL.

284
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:51,268
I HAD SO MUCH POISON IN ME

285
00:12:51,335 --> 00:12:54,605
I DIDN'T THINK I COULD
KEEP THE TRUCK ON THE ROAD.

286
00:12:54,672 --> 00:12:57,008
I JUST STAY AWAY FROM SNAKES.

287
00:12:57,074 --> 00:12:59,377
YOU DON'T LIKE ANIMALS,
DO YOU, RED?

288
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:01,445
WELL, NOT AS MUCH AS LIFE, NO.

289
00:13:01,512 --> 00:13:03,180
(Rustling)

290
00:13:07,151 --> 00:13:09,120
WHAT THE--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

291
00:13:09,186 --> 00:13:10,621
WHAT ARE YOU--

292
00:13:10,688 --> 00:13:12,123
THIS MEANS SNAKE.

293
00:13:12,189 --> 00:13:14,625
SORT OF A STANDARD HAND SIGNAL.

294
00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:16,127
ALL RIGHT.

295
00:13:16,193 --> 00:13:18,129
(Rustling)

296
00:13:18,195 --> 00:13:23,901
I THINK WE HAVE AN AUTHENTIC
"MISSISSAUGA" RATTLER.

297
00:13:23,968 --> 00:13:26,070
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS

298
00:13:26,137 --> 00:13:29,173
GRAB HIM AROUND THE HEAD
WITH THIS SNAKE POLE.

299
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,674
GOT HIM!

300
00:13:30,741 --> 00:13:33,077
WHOA, WHOA, BOY.

301
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:34,578
HE'S A BIG ONE.

302
00:13:34,645 --> 00:13:36,080
OH, SETTLE DOWN THERE.

303
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:37,681
HE'S GOT AN ATTITUDE.

304
00:13:37,748 --> 00:13:40,317
I'VE GOT A BURLAP BAG
ON THE PORCH.

305
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:42,586
I'M GOING TO PUT HIM IN THAT.

306
00:13:42,653 --> 00:13:45,589
GARTH, I THINK YOU GOT HIM
BY THE TAIL THERE.

307
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:47,091
HUH?

308
00:13:47,158 --> 00:13:48,592
(Chomping sound)

309
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:50,094
OH!

310
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:52,596
OH, OH.

311
00:13:52,663 --> 00:13:54,431
ANOTHER SUPER DAY.

312
00:13:54,498 --> 00:13:56,667
OH.

313
00:13:58,536 --> 00:14:00,037
(Sighing)

314
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,109
WELL, SURPRISE, SURPRISE.

315
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:07,144
THE BUMP IN THE ROAD IS BACK

316
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:09,847
AND IT'S BIGGER
AND BETTER THAN EVER.

317
00:14:12,683 --> 00:14:14,118
WHAT?

318
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:15,619
NOTHING.

319
00:14:15,686 --> 00:14:17,121
(Laughing)

320
00:14:17,187 --> 00:14:19,657
APPARENTLY,
WHEN THEY FIXED THE BUMP,

321
00:14:19,723 --> 00:14:22,693
EVERYBODY STARTED SPEEDING
SO MUCH INTO TOWN

322
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,896
THAT THEY DECIDED TO PUT
A SPEED BUMP IN THERE,

323
00:14:25,963 --> 00:14:27,531
A REALLY BIG ONE.

324
00:14:27,598 --> 00:14:30,000
(Laughing)

325
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:32,736
OK, OK, I OWE YOU ONE.

326
00:14:32,803 --> 00:14:35,372
YOU OWE ME ANOTHER ONE, HAROLD.

327
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:39,610
I WANT YOU TO GO DOWN THERE
AND PRETEND YOU'RE ME.

328
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:41,111
AT THE
EYE DOCTOR?

329
00:14:41,178 --> 00:14:44,214
THE LICENCE OFFICE --
YOU TAKE THE TEST FOR ME.

330
00:14:44,281 --> 00:14:47,184
WE'VE GOT THE SAME LAST NAME,
THE SAME ADDRESS.

331
00:14:47,251 --> 00:14:49,787
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T TELL THEM
YOUR I.Q.,

332
00:14:49,853 --> 00:14:51,355
THEY'LL THINK YOU'RE ME.

333
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:53,457
I GUESS THE BELL FELL OFF.

334
00:14:53,524 --> 00:14:56,160
I HOPE THE BELL FELL OFF.

335
00:14:57,661 --> 00:15:01,098
(Red): SO BILL'S STILL LOOKING
FOR OTHER-- OW.

336
00:15:01,165 --> 00:15:04,935
BILL'S STILL LOOKING FOR WAYS
THAT I CAN GET AROUND.

337
00:15:05,002 --> 00:15:07,438
OK, BILL, I'LL HELP YOU.

338
00:15:07,504 --> 00:15:09,740
THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR.

339
00:15:09,807 --> 00:15:12,142
SO, THIS IS
THE SKATEBOARD THING.

340
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:15,012
THEY'RE VERY POPULAR
WITH YOUNG PEOPLE.

341
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:17,848
NOT THAT MUCH TO IT,
I WOULDN'T THINK.

342
00:15:17,915 --> 00:15:19,283
WHAT?

343
00:15:19,349 --> 00:15:21,685
OH BOY, OH BOY,
WHERE'S THAT GOING?

344
00:15:21,752 --> 00:15:24,321
OK, UH, THAT'S NOT GOING TO

345
00:15:24,388 --> 00:15:25,823
WORK OUT THAT WELL.

346
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:29,092
OK, NOW HE'S GOT
THE INLINE SKATES.

347
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:32,463
WANTED ME TO HELP HIM
GET THAT-- OH.

348
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:33,964
OH.

349
00:15:34,031 --> 00:15:35,866
LOST A LITTLE BIT
OF PATIENCE HERE.

350
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:39,069
ALL RIGHT, THERE, THAT-- OK.

351
00:15:39,136 --> 00:15:41,305
THE THING WITH INLINE SKATES,

352
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:43,574
I BELIEVE
IT'S LIKE ICE SKATING.

353
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,576
IT'S A QUESTION OF BALANCE.

354
00:15:45,642 --> 00:15:49,012
IT'S MORE OF SORT OF
A NATURAL ATHLETIC ABILITY,

355
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:52,583
AND I GUESS IT TAKES
A LITTLE WHILE TO GET THE...

356
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:56,587
WHEN YOU START THINKING ABOUT
HOW SHORT LIFE IS --

357
00:15:56,653 --> 00:15:58,288
THERE HE GOES.

358
00:15:58,355 --> 00:16:01,058
THERE'S THAT TECHNIQUE --
OH, WHAT'S THIS?

359
00:16:01,124 --> 00:16:04,261
SKATEBOARD AND INLINE SKATES,
AND WHAT'S -- OK.

360
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:05,562
I DON'T WANT TO GET--

361
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:07,497
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, BILL?

362
00:16:07,564 --> 00:16:09,600
OH, I SEE.

363
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,768
HITCHHIKING.

364
00:16:11,835 --> 00:16:13,270
WELL, THAT MAKES SENSE.

365
00:16:13,337 --> 00:16:14,738
YOU GO AHEAD, BILL.

366
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:16,239
I'LL WAIT HERE.

367
00:16:16,306 --> 00:16:17,741
(Red): COMING UP,

368
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:19,643
HAROLD WILL IMPERSONATE ME.

369
00:16:24,481 --> 00:16:28,085
SOMETIMES YOU DO GET A GLIMPSE
OF JUSTICE IN THIS LIFE.

370
00:16:28,151 --> 00:16:30,687
OLD MAN SEDGWICK
WAS SO BUSY RAZZING ME,

371
00:16:30,754 --> 00:16:33,924
HE DROVE HIS MOTOR HOME
THROUGH A STAND OF TREES,

372
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:36,093
RIPPED THE SIDE MIRROR OFF.

373
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:38,895
HE WON'T EVEN NOTICE
TILL HE LOOKS IN IT,

374
00:16:38,962 --> 00:16:40,397
WHICH IS NEVER.

375
00:16:40,464 --> 00:16:43,934
HAROLD HAS AGREED TO TAKE
THE DRIVING TEST FOR ME

376
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,103
AS A WAY OF SECURING HIS PAY.

377
00:16:46,169 --> 00:16:47,971
HAROLD, COME ON IN.

378
00:16:48,038 --> 00:16:51,174
(Applause)

379
00:16:55,178 --> 00:16:56,880
AFTER
THE TEST,

380
00:16:56,947 --> 00:16:59,750
I'LL HAVE TO SIGN
THE ORGAN DONATION CARD.

381
00:16:59,816 --> 00:17:02,085
WHAT, WHAT,
HOLD IT, HOLD IT!

382
00:17:02,152 --> 00:17:03,620
I'M NOT DONATING ORGANS.

383
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:06,056
WHAT IF I GET TO HEAVEN
WITHOUT KIDNEYS

384
00:17:06,123 --> 00:17:07,691
AND THERE'S AN OPEN BAR?

385
00:17:07,758 --> 00:17:10,627
(Mimicking Red):
I'D CALL IT A SET-BACK.

386
00:17:10,694 --> 00:17:12,562
(Audience laughing)

387
00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:14,564
DON'T DO THAT, HAROLD.

388
00:17:14,631 --> 00:17:17,067
(Applause)

389
00:17:17,134 --> 00:17:20,070
(Mimicking Red): AHHHH,
DON'T DO WHAT?

390
00:17:20,137 --> 00:17:22,072
AHHHH, STOP CALLING ME HAROLD.

391
00:17:22,139 --> 00:17:25,208
JUST GET DOWN
AND GET MY LICENCE, PLEASE.

392
00:17:25,275 --> 00:17:27,010
(Mimicking Red): ALL RIGHT.

393
00:17:27,077 --> 00:17:28,812
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

394
00:17:28,879 --> 00:17:32,082
(Mimicking Harold): HAAA HAAA,
HA HA HA, HA HA HA.

395
00:17:32,148 --> 00:17:34,084
THAT'S FUNNY, UNCLE RED.

396
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,785
HA HA HA, HA HA HA.

397
00:17:35,852 --> 00:17:37,320
RANGER GORD AGAIN.

398
00:17:37,387 --> 00:17:40,857
HERE'S AN INTERESTING PIECE
OF WILDLIFE LORE.

399
00:17:40,924 --> 00:17:45,095
DURING THE MATING SEASON,
ANIMALS WILL CLAW THE TREES

400
00:17:45,161 --> 00:17:47,097
TO MARK THEIR TERRITORY.

401
00:17:47,163 --> 00:17:48,598
BEARS DO IT.

402
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:50,100
BADGERS DO IT.

403
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,601
SO DO WOLVES.

404
00:17:51,668 --> 00:17:55,105
BUT THESE MARKINGS
AREN'T FROM ANY OF THOSE.

405
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:56,940
THESE ARE...

406
00:17:57,007 --> 00:18:00,110
OH YEAH.

407
00:18:00,176 --> 00:18:02,679
WELL, I'M ONLY HUMAN.

408
00:18:03,847 --> 00:18:06,850
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT PORTION
OF THE SHOW.

409
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,219
THIS WEEK, WE HAVE MY UNCLE RED

410
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:12,422
AND WATER TAXI CAPTAIN,
MR. HAP SHAUGHNESSY.

411
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:13,990
(Applause)

412
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:21,765
THIS WEEK'S LETTER
GOES AS FOLLOWS.

413
00:18:21,831 --> 00:18:24,567
OH, COOL,
IT'S GOT A NAUTICAL THEME.

414
00:18:24,634 --> 00:18:26,069
HE'S A... THING.

415
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:29,973
"DEAR EXPERTS, HOW CAN
I HELP PROTECT THE WHALES?"

416
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,242
OH MAN,
I GOT TO TELL YOU,

417
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:33,743
I DON'T GET THIS.

418
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,812
I HEAR A LOT ABOUT THIS.

419
00:18:35,879 --> 00:18:39,749
YOU GOT AN ANIMAL,
THIS THING'S 100 FEET LONG,

420
00:18:39,816 --> 00:18:41,851
WEIGHS ABOUT 1,000 TONS.

421
00:18:41,918 --> 00:18:44,687
IF THIS THING
CAN'T TAKE CARE OF ITSELF,

422
00:18:44,754 --> 00:18:47,824
REALLY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I CAN DO FOR THEM.

423
00:18:47,891 --> 00:18:50,693
NO, RED --
HAROLD IS TALKING ABOUT WHALING.

424
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,195
OH.

425
00:18:52,262 --> 00:18:55,098
WE GOT TO AGREE TO STOP
KILLING THE WHALES.

426
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:56,599
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

427
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,369
NEXT TIME I SEE A WHALE
IN POSSUM LAKE,

428
00:18:59,436 --> 00:19:00,970
I'M GOING TO BACK OFF.

429
00:19:01,037 --> 00:19:04,507
I'LL SPEAK TO BERNICE
AND GET HER AND HER FRIENDS

430
00:19:04,574 --> 00:19:07,010
TO EASE OFF
THE WHALING ACTIVITIES.

431
00:19:07,076 --> 00:19:09,479
JUST BECAUSE NOBODY
YOU KNOW KILLS WHALES

432
00:19:09,546 --> 00:19:11,414
DOESN'T MEAN
IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

433
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:13,583
DON'T ASSUME
THINGS AREN'T HAPPENING

434
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,585
'CAUSE LODGE MEMBERS
DON'T DO IT.

435
00:19:15,652 --> 00:19:18,488
I'M THE FELLA
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, HAROLD.

436
00:19:18,555 --> 00:19:20,456
I WAS A WHALER AT ONE TIME.

437
00:19:20,523 --> 00:19:23,159
(Audience laughing)

438
00:19:27,831 --> 00:19:29,265
NEVER A PROFESSIONAL,

439
00:19:29,332 --> 00:19:31,834
NOT LIKE
THEM BIG JAPANESE SHIPS.

440
00:19:31,901 --> 00:19:34,370
NO, I WAS MORE OF
A SPORT WHALER.

441
00:19:34,437 --> 00:19:36,339
(Audience laughing)

442
00:19:36,406 --> 00:19:39,442
I WENT OUT IN THE CANOE,
YOU KNOW.

443
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:41,144
(Audience laughing)

444
00:19:41,211 --> 00:19:44,614
A 20-FOOTER, A BIG ONE.

445
00:19:44,681 --> 00:19:47,150
YEAH, SOUNDS
LIKE A BIG ONE.

446
00:19:47,216 --> 00:19:49,352
MR. SHAUGHNESSY,
HOW DID YOU GET

447
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:51,487
A BIG HARPOON GUN
INTO A CANOE?

448
00:19:51,554 --> 00:19:54,157
A HARPOON? --
WHERE'S THE SPORT IN THAT?

449
00:19:54,223 --> 00:19:57,627
NO, I'D WRAP A ROPE
AROUND MYSELF AND DIVE IN.

450
00:19:57,694 --> 00:20:01,164
I'D GRAB HIS TAIL, HANG ON,
AND WEAR HIM DOWN.

451
00:20:02,732 --> 00:20:04,100
IT WASN'T EASY.

452
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:07,603
DID YOU EVER SEE THEIR TAILS?

453
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,105
THEY'RE INCREDIBLE.

454
00:20:09,172 --> 00:20:10,606
WELL, INCREDIBLE TAILS

455
00:20:10,673 --> 00:20:13,476
WOULD BE RIGHT UP YOUR ALLEY,
I WOULD THINK.

456
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:15,845
(Audience laughing)

457
00:20:17,847 --> 00:20:22,285
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU
TO WEAR THIS WHALE DOWN?

458
00:20:22,352 --> 00:20:25,455
UH, 10, 20 MONTHS.

459
00:20:25,521 --> 00:20:27,623
(Audience laughing)

460
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,426
AND ME OUT THERE
THRASHING AROUND

461
00:20:30,493 --> 00:20:33,029
HANGING ON FOR A YEAR OR MORE.

462
00:20:33,096 --> 00:20:36,699
I TELL YOU, I BEGAN TO HATE
THE TASTE OF SEAFOOD.

463
00:20:36,766 --> 00:20:39,235
ALL EXCEPT THE STINGRAY.

464
00:20:39,302 --> 00:20:42,772
THEIR LITTLE TOES
ARE A DELICACY.

465
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:44,640
THAT WHALE WOULD COLLAPSE.

466
00:20:44,707 --> 00:20:46,175
I'D TOW IT INTO SHORE.

467
00:20:46,242 --> 00:20:49,245
THAT VILLAGE HAD
ENOUGH BLUBBER FOR THE YEAR.

468
00:20:49,312 --> 00:20:51,114
MR. SHAUGHNESSY, THAT...

469
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,149
IS A LOT OF BLUBBER.

470
00:20:53,216 --> 00:20:55,918
(Audience laughing)

471
00:20:55,985 --> 00:20:58,154
I STOPPED
AFTER I TRIED TO BATTLE

472
00:20:58,221 --> 00:21:00,523
THE GREAT WHITE WHALE
MOBY RICHARD.

473
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,024
(Audience laughing)

474
00:21:02,091 --> 00:21:04,894
I THINK YOU MEAN MOBY DICK.

475
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:06,596
NO,
I DIDN'T KNOW HIM THAT WELL.

476
00:21:12,668 --> 00:21:14,103
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

477
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,105
I COULD HAVE PASSED
THAT TEST EASY.

478
00:21:16,172 --> 00:21:17,607
WELL, YOU DIDN'T.

479
00:21:17,673 --> 00:21:19,609
IT'S NOT MY FAULT --

480
00:21:19,675 --> 00:21:22,345
YOUR BELLY GOT STUCK
IN THE STEERING WHEEL

481
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:25,615
AND I DROVE THE CAR
THROUGH MURRAY'S FRUIT STAND.

482
00:21:25,681 --> 00:21:27,116
OH MY GOSH.

483
00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:28,618
AH HA HA.

484
00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:30,686
THOSE STEMS REALLY HURT.

485
00:21:30,753 --> 00:21:32,188
WAIT A MINUTE.

486
00:21:32,255 --> 00:21:36,192
IF THEY THINK YOU'RE ME,
DO I GET BLAMED FOR THIS?

487
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:37,693
NO, NO.

488
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,195
MY BEARD WENT FLYING.

489
00:21:39,262 --> 00:21:40,630
I GOT HIT BY A KIWI.

490
00:21:40,696 --> 00:21:43,966
SO I HAD TO TELL THEM
WHO I REALLY WAS...

491
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:46,135
OLD MAN SEDGWICK.

492
00:21:46,202 --> 00:21:49,639
HIS LICENCE HAS BEEN
PERMANENTLY REVOKED.

493
00:21:49,705 --> 00:21:51,641
THAT IS EXCELLENT WORK.

494
00:21:51,707 --> 00:21:54,777
THANKS TO ME, THE ROAD
IS A SAFER PLACE TO BE.

495
00:21:54,844 --> 00:21:57,747
DON'T COUNT ON IT --
I GOT MY LICENCE BACK.

496
00:21:57,813 --> 00:21:59,248
WHILE YOU WERE

497
00:21:59,315 --> 00:22:00,850
MAKING FRUIT SALAD,

498
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:04,420
I WENT TO COURT AND BLAMED
THE MESS ON THE BUMP.

499
00:22:04,487 --> 00:22:06,422
THE JUDGE HATED THE BUMP, TOO.

500
00:22:06,489 --> 00:22:08,491
HE POINTED TO
A LUMP ON HIS HEAD

501
00:22:08,557 --> 00:22:09,759
WHERE HIS HAIR USED TO BE.

502
00:22:09,825 --> 00:22:11,661
SO I GOT MY LICENCE BACK.

503
00:22:11,727 --> 00:22:15,097
AS SOON AS I GET MY VAN BACK
I'LL BE COMPLETE.

504
00:22:15,164 --> 00:22:16,565
HOW SAD.

505
00:22:16,632 --> 00:22:18,100
(Possum squeal)

506
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:19,602
OH, MEETING TIME.

507
00:22:19,668 --> 00:22:21,103
I'M GOING TO GO.

508
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,606
I'VE GOT TO GET
SOME WATERMELON PITS

509
00:22:23,672 --> 00:22:25,107
OUT OF MY UNDIES.

510
00:22:25,174 --> 00:22:26,709
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

511
00:22:26,776 --> 00:22:29,478
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,
WHAT DO YOU SAY

512
00:22:29,545 --> 00:22:32,448
WE GO FOR A MOONLIT DRIVE
DOWN BY THE LAKE?

513
00:22:32,515 --> 00:22:34,817
A ROMANTIC SPOT
WHERE WE CAN PARK.

514
00:22:34,884 --> 00:22:37,520
DON'T WORRY,
I'LL TAKE EVERYTHING SLOW.

515
00:22:37,586 --> 00:22:40,222
I CAN'T AFFORD ANY MORE
DEMERIT POINTS.

516
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:43,559
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

517
00:22:43,626 --> 00:22:47,630
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND ALL
THE GUYS AT POSSUM LODGE,

518
00:22:47,696 --> 00:22:50,633
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

519
00:22:50,699 --> 00:22:53,202
(Applause)

520
00:22:55,204 --> 00:22:59,642
(Possum squeal)

521
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:01,644
(Harold): ALL RISE.

522
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,212
ALL RISE.

523
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:12,421
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.
