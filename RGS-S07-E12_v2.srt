1
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:09,275
IT’S THE NEW
RED GREEN SHOW

2
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:13,613
AND NOW HERE'S THE
HONOURING JOE WITH
THE RUSTY JACK,

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,415
YOUR HERO,
YOUR HOST,
MY UNCLE,

4
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:18,084
RED GR-E-E-E-N!

5
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:28,094
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

6
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:30,330
THANK YOU.

7
00:00:30,396 --> 00:00:31,698
APPRECIATE IT.

8
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,733
BIG, BIG, BIG WEEK UP
AT THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,237
THE POSSUM LAKE HIGH SCHOOL
MUSIC TEACHER HAS MOVED
INTO A SMALLER HOUSE

10
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:39,506
AND HAD TO GIVE UP HIS
WHOLE TUBA COLLECTION

11
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:45,879
SO, BY GOLLY, POSSUM LODGE
IS NOW THE PROUD OWNER
OF 137 TUBAS.

12
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,715
WHY WOULD THE MUSIC TEACHER,
LIKE, GIVE US ALL THOSE?

13
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:50,383
THAT'S 137 TUBAS.
THAT'S A LOT.

14
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,652
WELL, I THINK HE'S TRYING
TO IMPROVE OUR HEALTH

15
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,020
BECAUSE WHEN YOU
PLAY THE TUBA,

16
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:56,756
YOU'RE A LOT MORE CAREFUL
ABOUT WHAT YOU EAT.

17
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,759
I KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THEM.
I KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THEM.
I KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THEM.

18
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,328
YOU AND I, WE CAN LEARN
TO PLAY 'EM TOGETHER.

19
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,899
THAT WOULD BE GREAT BECAUSE,
YOU KNOW HOW YOU'RE ALWAYS
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING FOR
ME AND YOU TO DO?

20
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:08,935
I AM?

21
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,803
WELL, YOU KNOW, WE NEVER
DO ANYTHING TOGETHER,

22
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,772
SO I JUST ASSUMED YOU WERE
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING,

23
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,073
BUT IF YOU WEREN'T
THAT'S OKAY --

24
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,377
NO, NO, NO,
NOW, WAIT NOW.
LET'S DO THIS...

25
00:01:17,443 --> 00:01:19,612
EVERY TIME YOU AND
I ARE TOGETHER,

26
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:20,747
WHY DON'T YOU
PLAY THE TUBA?

27
00:01:20,813 --> 00:01:23,082
YES! YES! THAT'D BE SO
GREAT IF WE COULD DO THAT

28
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:26,019
BECAUSE I LOVE THAT INSTRUMENT.
IT'S JUST THIS BEAUTIFUL THING.

29
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:28,454
YOU KNOW, I'LL PRACTICE
REALLY HARD, AND I'LL LEARN
A WHOLE BUNCH OF SONGS,

30
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,423
AND WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER, I'LL
SHOW YOU WHAT I'VE LEARNED.

31
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,991
AND I'LL EVEN LEARN
SONGS THAT YOU LIKE --

32
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:33,326
THAT'LL BE GREAT --

33
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,761
LIKE THOSE MILITARY SONGS
THAT YOU LIKE SO MUCH.

34
00:01:34,827 --> 00:01:36,963
THEY WON'T SOUND SO OBSCENE
WHEN YOU CAN'T HEAR THE WORDS.

35
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,798
THAT'D BE FANTASTIC --
SO MUCH FUN.

36
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,433
I'M REALLY LOOKING
FORWARD TO THIS.

37
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,001
YEAH, YEAH.
ME TOO, HAROLD,

38
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:43,936
'CAUSE WHEN YOU'RE PLAYIN'
THE TUBA, YOU CAN'T TALK.

39
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:45,905
YEAH.

40
00:01:47,540 --> 00:02:00,686
[♪♪♪]

41
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:03,356
HERE'S A FEW SCENES
FROM THIS EPISODE.

42
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,024
NOW, I WAS GOING
TO EXPLAIN THINGS

43
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,626
'CAUSE I THINK I COULD
EXPLAIN THAT,

44
00:02:06,692 --> 00:02:09,662
AND I MIGHT ABLE
TO EXPLAIN THIS,

45
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,631
BUT I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHIN' FOLKS,

46
00:02:11,697 --> 00:02:14,200
I'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO EXPLAIN THAT.

47
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:26,279
(REALLY BAD TUBA PLAYING)

48
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:28,481
HAROLD, YOU BETTER
PLAY A DIFFERENT TUNE.

49
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:31,918
THE BULLS OVER AT ARNIE'S
ARE GETTING KIND OF EXCITED.

50
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:36,422
LISTEN TO THIS.
LISTEN TO THIS.
LISTEN TO THIS.
LISTEN TO THIS.

51
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,257
LISTEN TO THIS.

52
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,360
(BAD TUBA PLAYING)

53
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,362
(COUGHING)

54
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:46,566
(MORE BAD TUBA PLAYING)

55
00:02:46,632 --> 00:02:49,302
RECOGNIZE IT?

56
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:53,105
YEAH, THE DEATH SCENE
FROM "MOBY DICK."

57
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,340
NO!

58
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,410
"FLIGHT OF
THE BUMBLE BEE."

59
00:02:57,476 --> 00:02:59,412
FLIGHT OF
FANTASY, HAROLD.

60
00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:01,480
DON'T WORRY, WE'LL PUT YOU
RIGHT AT THE BACK OF THE PARADE.

61
00:03:01,547 --> 00:03:03,416
NOBODY'LL EVEN
HEAR YOU.

62
00:03:03,482 --> 00:03:04,717
WHAT PARADE?

63
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:05,785
OH, I DIDN'T
TELL YOU.

64
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:07,219
WE'RE GONNA
HAVE A PARADE...

65
00:03:07,286 --> 00:03:09,622
YEAH, ALL TUBAS.

66
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,024
OH, YEAH,
137 TUBAS.

67
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,694
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE KIND OF AN
ANNUAL TOURIST ATTRACTION THING,

68
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,228
LIKE MARDI GRAS,
ONLY MORE FUN.

69
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:19,131
WE'RE GONNA CALL
IT "PARDI GRAS."

70
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,766
NONE OF US PLAY
THE TUBA.

71
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,102
WELL, YOU SEE, ONE AT A TIME,
THAT'S A PROBLEM.

72
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,771
BUT YOU GET 137
PLAYING AT ONCE,

73
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,507
NOBODY'LL EVER KNOW.

74
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:34,647
BOY, THERE'S NOTHING MORE
FRUSTRATING THAN THE COST
OF SOMETHING AFTER
YOU'VE BOUGHT IT.

75
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,415
I BOUGHT THIS CAR FROM
BUSTER HADFIELD.

76
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,551
NOW IT'S GOT TWO
FLAT FRONT TIRES.

77
00:03:38,617 --> 00:03:42,021
NOW, I CAN BUY TIRES, BUT A NEW
TIRE IS GONNA BE ABOUT 85 BUCKS.

78
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,322
THERE'S TWO OF 'EM,

79
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,257
THAT WOULD BE --

80
00:03:45,324 --> 00:03:48,327
WELL OVER $100 WITH TAX.

81
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,730
I ONLY PAID 50 BUCKS
FOR THE WHOLE CAR.

82
00:03:50,796 --> 00:03:53,332
ANYBODY WHO WOULD SPEND
100 BUCKS ON A $50 CAR

83
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,234
DOESN'T BELONG AT POSSUM LODGE,

84
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,536
THEY BELONG IN
THE GOVERNMENT.

85
00:03:57,603 --> 00:03:59,739
ALL RIGHT, SO THE FIRST THING
YOU CAN DO IS CHECK THE TRUNK.

86
00:03:59,805 --> 00:04:04,076
YOU MIGHT HAVE A SPARE.
THAT'LL SAVE YOU ONE TIRE.

87
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,479
NO.

88
00:04:06,545 --> 00:04:10,950
OKAY, SO THIS WEEK ON HANDYMAN
CORNER, I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU
HOW TO MAKE YOUR VERY OWN
INEXPENSIVE TIRES.

89
00:04:11,016 --> 00:04:12,384
FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO...

90
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:13,953
CLEAN OUT YOUR CLOSET.

91
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,722
ALL RIGHT, THE OBVIOUS
QUESTION IS...

92
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,891
WHY ARE YOU HANGING ON
TO THESE CLOTHES?

93
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,193
AND DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE SAVING
THEM TO WASH YOUR CAR WITH THEM.

94
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,996
PEOPLE WITH  CLOTHES LIKE
THIS DON'T WASH THEIR CARS.

95
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:27,833
SO THROW THEM AWAY, OR DONATE
THEM TO CLOWN COLLEGE
OR SOMETHING.

96
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,335
AND THAT LEAVES YOU
WITH YOUR FOOTWEAR.

97
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:31,403
YOU WANT TO HANG ON TO THESE

98
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,674
BECAUSE THESE PENNY LOAFERS
AND DISCO BOOTS ARE GOING
TO BECOME YOUR NEW TIRES.

99
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:39,378
ALL RIGHT, THE NEXT THING YOU
NEED IS A PRETTY LONG PIECE
OF FOUR-INCH STEEL PIPE,

100
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,214
WHICH YOU CAN BUY OR,
NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN,

101
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:44,483
CAN DIG UP RIGHT IN
YOUR OWN BACKYARD...

102
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,951
OR SOMEBODY'S BACKYARD.

103
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,689
NOW YOU'VE GOT TO CUT THE
PIPE INTO 18-INCH LENGTHS.

104
00:04:50,756 --> 00:04:53,225
THERE IS AN EASIER WAY AROUND
MAKING THAT MANY CUTS,

105
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:56,462
BUT IT INVOLVES YOU HAVING A
STUPID FRIEND OR A SON,

106
00:04:56,528 --> 00:04:58,297
AND I'M NOT THAT LUCKY.

107
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,871
OH, MAN.

108
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:06,739
ALL RIGHT.

109
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:13,445
TAKE YOUR PIECE OF PIPE NOW,
AND ATTACH THAT TO THE RIM.

110
00:05:13,512 --> 00:05:16,482
THAT'S GONNA MAKE A
PRETTY BIG SHOE TIRE THERE.

111
00:05:16,548 --> 00:05:18,484
WHAT YOU CAN DO IS SHORTEN --

112
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,718
NO, I'M NOT GOING TO --

113
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:21,687
NO, OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

114
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:26,425
YOU CAN JUST CUT OUT THE FENDER
HERE A LITTLE BIT, MAKE ROOM
FOR OUR BIG SHOE TIRE.

115
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,760
OH, YEAH, THIS'LL --

116
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:29,194
NO PROBLEM.

117
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,402
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ONE.

118
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:37,770
WELL, THE TIRE TOOK
A FEW HITS THERE.

119
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:40,639
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT TO GET
THAT TIRE OFF THE RIM ANYWAY,

120
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:43,842
SO I MUST'VE MEANT THAT.

121
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:45,577
ALL RIGHT.

122
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:52,317
ALL RIGHT, NOW YOU WANT
TO ATTACH THE PIPES TO
THE RIM THERE.

123
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:54,219
YOU CAN WELD THEM ON THERE,

124
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:57,156
BUT I'LL TELL YOU, THEY GOT
THIS NEW GLUE NOW THAT
DRIES INSTANTLY,

125
00:05:57,222 --> 00:05:59,158
AND IT'S AS STRONG AS A WELD.

126
00:06:05,964 --> 00:06:07,432
HAROLD, THIS STUFF'S CRAP.

127
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:12,371
ALL RIGHT, NOW, THIS IS THE
BASIC STRUCTURE OF YOUR TIRE.

128
00:06:12,437 --> 00:06:13,739
ALL THAT'S MISSING
IS THE SHOES.

129
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:17,009
YOU PUT THE LEFTS ON THE LEFT
SIDE, RIGHTS ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

130
00:06:17,075 --> 00:06:18,443
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

131
00:06:19,845 --> 00:06:21,480
I'LL TELL YOU THE BEAUTY
OF THIS SYSTEM,

132
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,382
YOU CAN MATCH YOUR FOOTWEAR
TO THE WEATHER CONDITIONS.

133
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:26,118
YOU'VE GOT YOUR RUBBER BOOTS FOR
THE RAIN, KODIAKS FOR THE SNOW,

134
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,986
RUNNING SHOES WHEN
YOU'RE IN A HURRY.

135
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:30,389
I WOULD SAY HUSH PUPPIES
FOR NORMAL DRIVING

136
00:06:30,455 --> 00:06:33,692
AND FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS,
THOSE FLUFFY PINK SLIPPERS.

137
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,527
I'VE GOT A KIND
OF MIX ON THERE,

138
00:06:35,594 --> 00:06:38,630
SO IT'S MORE OR LESS
AN ALL-WEATHER TIRE.

139
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:40,799
DROP HER DOWN,

140
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:42,501
AND I'M ALL SET TO GO.

141
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,569
AND THE BEAUTY OF IT IS,

142
00:06:43,635 --> 00:06:45,070
IF I DO HAVE A FLAT TIRE,

143
00:06:45,137 --> 00:06:47,706
I'M CARRYING TWO
SPARES WITH ME,

144
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:51,209
PLUS ALL THOSE EXTRA SHOES YOU
FIND ALONG THE SIDE OF THE
ROAD FOR SOME REASON.

145
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:54,346
MAYBE I'M NOT THE FIRST
ONE TO TRY THIS IDEA.

146
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,982
NO, NO, NO, NO.
I'M PROBABLY THE FIRST ONE.

147
00:06:57,049 --> 00:07:01,720
ALL RIGHT, SO REMEMBER, IF WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

148
00:07:01,787 --> 00:07:03,488
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

149
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:05,123
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

150
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,559
I GOTTA MAKE TRACKS.

151
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,995
HIT MY SHOE HORN.

152
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,430
(HORN HONKING)

153
00:07:11,496 --> 00:07:14,433
SHOE TIRES,
JUST DO IT.

154
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:25,610
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
OLDER GUYS OUT THERE.

155
00:07:25,677 --> 00:07:27,612
YOU KNOW, THERE'S
GONNA COME A DAY,

156
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:30,749
ONE OF THESE DAYS YOU'RE GONNA
GO INTO WORK, AND YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE A NEW BOSS.

157
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:33,852
AND CHANCES ARE THAT BOSS IS
GONNA BE YOUNGER THAN YOU,

158
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,721
MAYBE A LOT YOUNGER,

159
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:38,090
MAYBE YOUNGER THAN YOUR KIDS,

160
00:07:38,156 --> 00:07:39,858
AND THAT CAN BE
KIND OF AWKWARD.

161
00:07:39,925 --> 00:07:41,460
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A BIT
OF ADJUSTMENT THERE,

162
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:44,096
'CAUSE THEY GET THESE NEW YOUNG
GUYS, THEY COME OUT OF SCHOOL,

163
00:07:44,162 --> 00:07:47,365
AND THEY'VE GOT SOME KIND OF
EDUCATION, AND THEY FEEL THEY
GOTTA MAKE AN IMPRESSION,

164
00:07:47,432 --> 00:07:52,170
AND THEY START UPSETTING
THE ROUTINE, MOVING THE COFFEE
MACHINE, THAT KIND OF THING.

165
00:07:52,237 --> 00:07:53,405
SO HERE'S WHAT TO DO.

166
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:55,907
JUST KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN;
STAY OUT OF THE WAY.

167
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:58,343
OH, YEAH. A COUPLE OF
YEARS DOWN THE ROAD,

168
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:02,514
THAT YOUNG BOSS'LL GET MARRIED,
HAVE KIDS, GET HIMSELF A HOUSE,

169
00:08:02,581 --> 00:08:06,318
AND HE'LL BE AS FRUSTRATED
WITH LIFE AS YOU ARE,

170
00:08:06,384 --> 00:08:08,887
AND WORK'LL GET RIGHT
BACK TO NORMAL.

171
00:08:08,954 --> 00:08:11,089
SO LOOK, DON'T DO ANYTHING.

172
00:08:11,156 --> 00:08:14,626
IT'S WORKED GREAT
FOR YOU SO FAR.

173
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:17,629
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

174
00:08:21,132 --> 00:08:22,133
OW!

175
00:08:25,003 --> 00:08:29,007
(REALLY BAD TUBA PLAYING)

176
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:33,011
(BLOWING)

177
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:34,679
TRY EMPTYING THE SPIT
VALVE THERE, HAROLD.

178
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:36,648
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

179
00:08:36,715 --> 00:08:40,785
(LAUGHTER)

180
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,189
TOO BAD I'VE GOT
SUCH A LONG NAME.

181
00:09:19,758 --> 00:09:22,761
MAN, IS THAT A
TUBA OR A SCUBA?

182
00:09:22,827 --> 00:09:26,631
NO, NO, I LEFT IT
OUT IN THE RAIN.

183
00:09:26,698 --> 00:09:28,533
SCARY.

184
00:09:29,467 --> 00:09:33,071
WELL, THINGS ARE REALLY COMING
TOGETHER, THOUGH, FOR OUR PARDI
GRAS PARADE, I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

185
00:09:33,138 --> 00:09:34,806
YOU KNOW WHAT, UNCLE RED,
I WAS DOING SOME READING,

186
00:09:34,873 --> 00:09:37,275
AND MARDI GRAS
MEANS FAT TUESDAY,

187
00:09:37,342 --> 00:09:40,011
WHICH ALREADY SOUNDS
LIKE A LODGE EVENT.

188
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:41,980
I THINK THE PARADE IS REALLY
GOING TO BE SOMETHING,

189
00:09:42,046 --> 00:09:43,815
WE'RE HAVING A
NAUTICAL THEME

190
00:09:43,882 --> 00:09:47,619
'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO
HAVE A FLOATING BOAT TO
MAKE A BOATING FLOAT.

191
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,622
AND WE GOT COSTUMES,
AND WE GOT CLOWNS,

192
00:09:50,688 --> 00:09:52,791
AND WE GOT RUBBER THINGS
TO THROW AT THE CROWD.

193
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:56,060
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE YOU NEED?
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE YOU NEED?
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE YOU NEED?

194
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:58,530
YOU NEED, LIKE,
A FIGUREHEAD.

195
00:09:58,596 --> 00:10:02,167
YOU KNOW, A FIGUREHEAD LIKE
SANTA CLAUS, OR THE EASTER
BUNNY OR SPIDERMAN OR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

196
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:05,937
AND THEN WHAT YOU DO IS, YOU PUT
HIM RIGHT ON THE LAST FLOAT
RIGHT AT THE END.

197
00:10:06,004 --> 00:10:08,773
THAT WAY THEY BECOME THE
FOCUS OF THE ENTIRE PARADE.

198
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,912
LIKE THE PRINCE OF
PARDI GRAS KIND OF THING?

199
00:10:13,978 --> 00:10:15,680
EXCELLENT CHOICE.

200
00:10:15,747 --> 00:10:19,083
OH, YEAH, YOU PUT HIM,
YOU KNOW, IN SOME KIND
OF A REALLY COOL COSTUME,

201
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,819
YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY WHO CAPTURES
THE SPIRIT OF PARDI GRAS

202
00:10:21,886 --> 00:10:24,923
AND, OF COURSE, LOOKS
GOOD IN A SEA OF TUBAS.

203
00:10:24,989 --> 00:10:26,824
HAROLD, YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'D BE GREAT AT THAT.

204
00:10:26,891 --> 00:10:29,160
NO, NO WAY.

205
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:33,197
NO, I DON'T WANNA BECAUSE
IT WILL BE EMBARRASSING.

206
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:34,532
I DON'T LIKE BEING
EMBARRASSED.

207
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:36,834
OH, HAROLD,
YOU MUST.

208
00:10:40,571 --> 00:10:43,808
THIS IS KIND OF A, SORT OF,
ANTIQUE ROADKILL SHOW
KIND OF A DEAL,

209
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,710
WHERE LODGE MEMBERS COME IN

210
00:10:45,777 --> 00:10:50,048
AND SEE IF THEY'RE SITTING
ON THE FAMILY JEWELS OR
JUST A CHEAP IMITATION.

211
00:10:50,114 --> 00:10:53,084
OUR EXPERT DALTON HUMPHREY IS
GONNA TELL 'EM WHICH ONE IT IS.

212
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:54,519
DALTON.

213
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:56,054
WELL, THANK YOU, RED,

214
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,624
AND I'M HERE WITH MIKE HAMAR
WHO IS HERE THANKS TO
THE PAROLE BOARD.

215
00:10:59,691 --> 00:11:01,292
THANKS DALTON.

216
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:05,029
I GOT THIS HERE
THING TO SHOW YOU.

217
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,270
YEAH, MY MOM WON
THIS IN 1966

218
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:15,807
WHEN SHE WAS CROWNED
MISS NUDE AMERICA.

219
00:11:15,873 --> 00:11:18,176
AND THIS WAS THE FIRST PLACE
TROPHY, WAS IT, MIKE?

220
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:19,410
YEAH.

221
00:11:19,477 --> 00:11:24,015
THIS CUP WITH THE RELIGIOUS
INSCRIPTIONS ALL OVER IT?

222
00:11:24,082 --> 00:11:26,017
LATIN ENGRAVING OF

223
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:29,487
THE LIFE OF
St. IGNATIUS?

224
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:31,989
YEAH, WELL, IT WAS
DONATED BY THE POPE.

225
00:11:32,056 --> 00:11:34,725
OH, THE POPE.

226
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:36,194
WELL, NOT 'THE' POPE,

227
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,530
BUT, LIKE, A POPE,
UH-HUH.

228
00:11:40,498 --> 00:11:42,700
KINDA LIKE AN
ASSISTANT POPE.

229
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:43,901
THE ARCHBISHOP?

230
00:11:43,968 --> 00:11:45,503
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

231
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,472
SEE, HE DONATED
IT TO THE CONTEST

232
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:50,942
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, HE THOUGHT
THE CONTEST WAS SINFUL,

233
00:11:51,008 --> 00:11:53,544
AND HE HOPED, LIKE, A
BEAUTIFUL RELIGIOUS THING

234
00:11:53,611 --> 00:11:56,314
WOULD MAKE EVERYONE REJECT SIN

235
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,684
AND 'PROSTATE' THEMSELVES
BEFORE THEIR MAKER

236
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,452
AND, YOU KNOW,
BEG FORGIVENESS,

237
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,088
KIND OF LIKE A HEAVENLY
PAROLE HEARING.

238
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:08,092
AND THE ARCHBISHOP THAT
DONATED THIS, DO YOU
REMEMBER HIS NAME?

239
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:10,828
AH, DAVE.

240
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,799
DAVE.

241
00:12:14,865 --> 00:12:18,970
WELL, NOW, ARCHBISHOP DAVE

242
00:12:19,036 --> 00:12:20,338
HAD EXCELLENT TASTE

243
00:12:20,404 --> 00:12:24,742
BECAUSE THIS IS A LOVELY
SILVER AND GOLD PIECE,

244
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:28,913
AND IT IS EXACTLY LIKE
THE ONE IN St. MICHAEL'S
CHURCH IN PORT ASBESTOS.

245
00:12:30,147 --> 00:12:31,315
NO KIDDING.

246
00:12:31,382 --> 00:12:33,184
YES.

247
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,888
IT'S A SILVER AND GOLD CUP
THAT IS USED TO HOLD
HOLY WATER, MIKE;

248
00:12:37,955 --> 00:12:41,025
A CUP THAT WAS ORIGINALLY
WORTH $2,000.

249
00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:43,628
THAT WAS IN 1937,

250
00:12:43,694 --> 00:12:46,097
SO THIS IS A CUP
THAT IS WORTH NOW

251
00:12:46,163 --> 00:12:49,633
PERHAPS OVER $50,000.

252
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,436
YES, IT'S A CUP THAT

253
00:12:52,503 --> 00:12:57,675
THE GOOD PARISHIONERS OF THE
CHURCH SAVED FOR MANY, MANY
YEARS TO BE ABLE TO BUY.

254
00:12:57,742 --> 00:13:05,349
IT'S A CUP THAT HAS BEEN AT THAT
CHURCH AND BEEN A SOURCE OF
FAITH AND PRIDE FOR WELL
OVER HALF A CENTURY.

255
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:09,153
THIS IS A CUP THAT
THEY WOULD REALLY
LIKE TO GET BACK!

256
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,124
(WEEPING)

257
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,659
MIKE,

258
00:13:15,726 --> 00:13:18,763
MIKE, YOU'RE CRYING.
YEAH.

259
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:22,466
MIKE, WHY ARE
YOU CRYING?

260
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:26,337
'CAUSE I'M
GONNA BE RICH.

261
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:43,287
I WAS A LITTLE LATE ARRIVING
FOR MY ADVENTURE WITH BILL
THIS WEEK.

262
00:13:43,354 --> 00:13:46,390
ANYWAY, OKAY, HE'S GOOD.
HOW YOU DOING BILL?

263
00:13:46,457 --> 00:13:48,259
WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY?

264
00:13:48,325 --> 00:13:52,463
BILL'S GOT A BIT OF A
CARNIVAL PLANNED, I HEARD.

265
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:56,333
I THOUGHT ONLY WOMEN HAD
DARTS IN THEIR CLOTHES.

266
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,402
ALL RIGHT. I CAN THROW A DART.

267
00:13:58,469 --> 00:14:01,272
OH, MY GOSH, USED TO DO
THIS DOWN AT THE OLD
SIDESHOW THERE,

268
00:14:01,338 --> 00:14:02,973
MY MOM USED TO WORK THERE.

269
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,110
THERE YOU GO,
THREE FOR THREE.
GIVE IT A TRY BILL.

270
00:14:06,176 --> 00:14:09,647
ARE THEY SHARP DARTS, BILL?

271
00:14:09,713 --> 00:14:10,814
I DON'T THINK SO.

272
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:12,750
NO, TRY ANOTHER ONE.

273
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:15,786
OH, BOY! OH!

274
00:14:15,853 --> 00:14:18,322
OH, MY GOSH.

275
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:20,124
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT WAS.

276
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,760
ALL RIGHT, THE OLD
WOODEN MILK BOTTLES.
THIS IS A LOT OF FUN.

277
00:14:22,826 --> 00:14:27,498
TAKE A SOFTBALL AND FIRE THEM
AT THE MILK BOTTLES, AND THEY
ALL COME CRASHING DOWN.

278
00:14:27,564 --> 00:14:29,300
NOT BAD.
THAT'S HALF A PRIZE.

279
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:33,003
YOU HAVE A GO, BILL.

280
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,307
I GUESS THOSE WERE REAL --
WELL, WHAT ELSE WE GOT?

281
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:38,676
GOT ANY MORE
EVENTS THERE, BILL?

282
00:14:38,742 --> 00:14:43,080
OH, OH, I KNOW
WHAT THIS IS.

283
00:14:43,147 --> 00:14:46,316
THIS IS THE STRONG MAN
AND THE HAMMER AND --
SLEDGE HAMMER.

284
00:14:48,752 --> 00:14:50,721
SEE YOU IN A MINUTE.

285
00:14:52,356 --> 00:14:54,958
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT BILL AND
LADDERS. I DON'T THINK HE
UNDERSTANDS THE CONCEPT.

286
00:14:55,025 --> 00:14:57,528
HE'S GOT A LITTLE RING THERE.
HE'S GOT THAT WELDED ON THERE,

287
00:14:57,594 --> 00:15:01,198
AND IT SITS ON THE 4X4,
AND WHEN YOU SLAM ON THE
END OF THE 4X4,

288
00:15:01,265 --> 00:15:03,167
THE CHAIN RUSHES UP THE POLE...

289
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:05,135
WELL, YOU FIGURE IT OUT!

290
00:15:05,202 --> 00:15:07,104
OKAY, GIVE 'ER A GO.
WANT ME TO TRY?

291
00:15:07,171 --> 00:15:09,540
OH, YEAH, LOOK AT THAT.

292
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:14,144
I WANT A BIT OF THAT AGAIN.
THAT WAS FUN.

293
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:15,446
LOOK OUT, BILL.
I'M GONNA DO IT AGAIN.

294
00:15:15,512 --> 00:15:17,548
I'M GOIN' AGAIN.
BILL, I'M GOIN' AGAIN.

295
00:15:17,614 --> 00:15:20,350
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
YOU GO. YOU GO.

296
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:23,120
OKAY. OKAY. OKAY.

297
00:15:24,688 --> 00:15:29,893
A-W-W-W, THAT'S TOO BAD.

298
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,363
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE
SORT OF ARM STRENGTH.

299
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,032
THAT'S A SHAME.

300
00:15:35,098 --> 00:15:36,500
OH, BOY.
OH, BOY.
OH, BOY.

301
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:41,171
OH! OW! GEESH!

302
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,609
OKAY. NO, I'M FINE.

303
00:15:45,676 --> 00:15:47,144
THAT'S FINE.
THAT'S GOOD. IT'S GOOD.

304
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:48,645
OKAY, BILL, GIVE IT A TRY.

305
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:50,480
I'LL STAND BACK A BIT.

306
00:15:50,547 --> 00:15:53,417
MY GOSH, LOOK AT THIS.
HE'S GOING FOR IT.
HE'S GOING FOR IT.

307
00:15:53,483 --> 00:15:55,852
LOOK AT THAT, AND HE'S GOT IT.

308
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:57,821
WHAT PRIZE HAVE WE
GOT FOR HIM?

309
00:15:57,888 --> 00:16:00,791
OH, A MIRROR.
OH, WHAT A FUN DAY.

310
00:16:00,857 --> 00:16:04,094
A-A-A-H!

311
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:13,770

313
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:16,940
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

315
00:16:18,976 --> 00:16:20,510

316
00:16:20,577 --> 00:16:22,245
OW!

317
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:27,985
KIND OF AN ODD ECHO
IN THIS PART OF THE LODGE.

318
00:16:28,051 --> 00:16:31,955
ANYWAY, THINGS ARE REALLY
COMIN' TOGETHER WITH OUR
PARDI GRAS PARADE THING.

319
00:16:32,022 --> 00:16:34,024
WE GOT OUR FIGUREHEAD.

320
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:37,461
GOT OUR PAMPLEMOUSSE,
THE PRINCE OF THE
PARDI GRAS PARADE.

321
00:16:37,527 --> 00:16:39,096
COME ON, PAMPLEMOUSSE.
COME ON IN.

322
00:16:39,162 --> 00:16:40,797
Harold:  NO!
COME ON,
PAMPLEMOUSSE.

323
00:16:40,864 --> 00:16:44,768
Harold:  NO!
COME ON, EVERYONE
LOVES A PAMPLEMOUSSE

324
00:16:44,835 --> 00:16:47,037
COME ON.
COME ON.
HERE WE GO.

325

326
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:03,754
GIVE 'EM THE SPEECH.
GIVE 'EM THE SPEECH.

327
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,022
SAY IT.
SAY IT.
SAY IT.

328
00:17:07,457 --> 00:17:11,595
I AM PROUD TO WEAR THE
CEREMONIAL COSTUME OF
THE GREAT PAMPLEMOUSSE,

329
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:14,431
PROTECTOR OF ALL
PARDI GRASSERS.

330
00:17:15,065 --> 00:17:16,967
VERY GOOD.
VERY GOOD.

331
00:17:17,033 --> 00:17:20,637
NOW, HAROLD, THE WAY I
UNDERSTAND THE LEGEND,

332
00:17:20,704 --> 00:17:22,172
TO WEAR A CEREMONIAL
GARB LIKE THAT,

333
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:24,841
YOU HAVE TO BE A VIRGIN.
YOU MAY BE OVERQUALIFIED.

334
00:17:29,513 --> 00:17:30,714
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I'LL BE OKAY.

335
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,649
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

336
00:17:32,716 --> 00:17:35,952
I'M GUESSING YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO WEAR THAT FOR THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE.

337
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:38,522
ANYWAY, I GOT MY HORN,
I GOT MY PAMPLEMOUSSE,

338
00:17:38,588 --> 00:17:39,589
AND I'M READY TO ROCK.

339
00:17:39,656 --> 00:17:40,957
LET'S GO, HAROLD.

340
00:17:41,024 --> 00:17:43,226
I FORGOT TO GO TO THE BATHROOM
BEFORE I PUT THE COSTUME ON.

341
00:17:43,293 --> 00:17:45,328
OH, HAROLD, HAROLD, HAROLD,
THERE'S 137 TUBAS,

342
00:17:45,395 --> 00:17:48,131
YOU'LL THINK
OF SOMETHIN'.

343
00:17:49,699 --> 00:17:51,568
THIS IS THE REPAIR SHOP
PART OF THE SHOW WE CALL,

344
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:54,337
"IF IT AIN'T BROKE,
YOU'RE NOT TRYING."

345
00:17:55,372 --> 00:17:58,041
BUZZ SHERWOOD IS HERE WITH
SOMETHING FOR US TO FIX.

346
00:17:58,108 --> 00:18:00,644
WHOA!! RED,
MAN, WHOA!

347
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:07,784
YOU KNOW, BUZZ, I DIDN'T
HEAR YOUR PLANE LAND HERE.

348
00:18:07,851 --> 00:18:08,952
DID YOU DRIVE TO
THE LODGE TODAY?

349
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:10,353
NO, MAN, I FLEW,

350
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,921
BUT I HAD TO LAND
WITHOUT THE PROPELLER

351
00:18:11,988 --> 00:18:13,790
'CAUSE I RAN OUT
OF GAS, RIGHT?

352
00:18:13,857 --> 00:18:16,359
YEAH, SO I HAD TO UM --

353
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:19,029
WHAT'S THAT WHEN YOU LAND THE
PLANE WITHOUT THE PROPELLER?

354
00:18:19,095 --> 00:18:20,864
I DO IT ALL
THE TIME.

355
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:21,665
GLIDE?

356
00:18:21,731 --> 00:18:23,233
CRASH!

357
00:18:24,734 --> 00:18:27,137
SO, RIGHT, I GOT YOU
A TOASTER HERE

358
00:18:27,203 --> 00:18:29,105
'CAUSE, LIKE,
IT'S STUCK.

359
00:18:29,172 --> 00:18:30,273
YOU GOT SOME BREAD
STUCK IN THERE?

360
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,910
OH, MAN, ALL MY
BREAD'S IN THERE.

361
00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:35,578
WHAT THE HECK IS
THAT IN THERE?

362
00:18:35,645 --> 00:18:37,814
MY WALLET.

363
00:18:38,148 --> 00:18:39,449
ALL MY BREAD'S
IN THERE, MAN.

364
00:18:39,516 --> 00:18:42,352
I MEAN, I CAN'T EVEN GO
OUT AND BUY A NEW TOASTER.

365
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:44,988
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
LET'S PLUG HER IN.

366
00:18:45,055 --> 00:18:46,523
COOL.

367
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:47,724
HOW DID YOU GET YOUR WALLET
STUCK IN THE TOASTER, BUZZ?

368
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,993
I HAVE NO IDEA.

369
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,861
ALL RIGHT.

370
00:18:51,928 --> 00:18:54,030
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES WITH THESE
OLDER TOASTERS THERE'S A LITTLE
ADJUSTMENT YOU CAN MAKE --

371
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,568
NO, THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S THE OTHER SIDE.

372
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:05,175
WHOA, FLASHBACKS!

373
00:19:08,378 --> 00:19:11,881
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

374
00:19:11,948 --> 00:19:14,317
YEAH.

375
00:19:14,384 --> 00:19:15,518
YOU KNOW, BUZZ, SOMETIMES IN
LIFE, YOU HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE.

376
00:19:15,585 --> 00:19:17,086
SURE, SURE.

377
00:19:17,153 --> 00:19:18,755
YOU CAN HAVE THE TOASTER,
OR YOU CAN HAVE THE WALLET.

378
00:19:18,822 --> 00:19:20,290
YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH.

379
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:23,693
WALLET.

380
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,762
GOOD CHOICE.

381
00:19:28,198 --> 00:19:30,767
OH, MAN, MY WALLET.

382
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,135
IT'S -- IT'S --

383
00:19:32,202 --> 00:19:34,470
IT'S TOAST.

384
00:19:41,945 --> 00:19:44,180
ALL RIGHT. I HATE TO
BE A PARDI GRAS POOPER,

385
00:19:44,247 --> 00:19:46,583
BUT THAT WAS BAD.

386
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:51,955
HOW IRONIC THAT MARDI GRAS IS
PANCAKE DAY, AND HAROLD WAS
THE ONE TO GET PANCAKED.

387
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,358
LET ME START BY SAYING

388
00:19:55,425 --> 00:19:58,695
IT'S VERY EASY TO UNDERESTIMATE
THE STEEPNESS OF A HILL.

389
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:07,770
AND, IN FAIRNESS, FLOATS WERE
NEVER MADE TO REACH THOSE
KINDS OF SPEEDS.

390
00:20:09,172 --> 00:20:12,008
NOW, LUCKILY THE IMPACT
DIDN'T HURT HAROLD

391
00:20:12,075 --> 00:20:15,278
BECAUSE, OF COURSE,
HE WAS AIRBORNE BY THEN.

392
00:20:15,578 --> 00:20:17,680
AND I THINK IF I HAD HAD A
LITTLE MORE TIME TO THINK,

393
00:20:17,747 --> 00:20:22,719
I COULD'VE CAUGHT HIM RATHER
THAN JUST SHIELD MYSELF
WITH MY TUBA LIKE THAT.

394
00:20:22,785 --> 00:20:27,223
THIS WAS ALL I COULD SAVE.

395
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:32,562
I TELL YOU, IT BROKE MY HEART
TO SEE HAROLD ALL WRAPPED
UP IN THAT TUBA,

396
00:20:32,628 --> 00:20:35,798
SOMERSAULTING DOWN THE
MAIN STREET LIKE THAT.

397
00:20:35,865 --> 00:20:38,868
AND I NEVER REALLY
MEANT TO HURT HIM.

398
00:20:38,935 --> 00:20:42,338
THIS IS A SAD, SAD DAY.

YOU?!

402
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,462
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I FORGIVE YOU.

403
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:08,030
REALLY?
YEAH.

404
00:21:08,097 --> 00:21:12,768
YOU KNOW, THAT TAKES
A LOT OF BRASS.

405
00:21:14,036 --> 00:21:15,705
JUST A WARNING...

406
00:21:15,771 --> 00:21:18,541
DON'T OPEN MY SPIT VALVE.

407
00:21:20,443 --> 00:21:23,813
HAROLD, I THINK IT'S ONLY
RIGHT THAT YOU HAVE THIS.

BRINGING HAROLD HOME.

AT LEAST WE CAN GET HIM TUNED.

UM, BUSTER HADFIELD'S
DOG HAS RUN AWAY AGAIN.

THERE'S NO
DESCRIPTION AVAILABLE.

BUSTER SAYS THE DOG'S
RUN AWAY SO MANY TIMES,

438
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,077
HE'S FORGOTTEN WHAT IT
LOOKS LIKE FROM THE FRONT.

GET TO RESEMBLE THEIR
