00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,740
Bernice thought
it would be nice

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,075
to have a concrete bench
somewhere in our yard.

3
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:12,011
Not here, you know,
but somewhere.

4
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:14,714
So now she's decided she
wants it on the other
side of the house.

5
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:16,583
That's where
the sun is.

6
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,052
I'm not quite sure how
sunlight affects concrete.

7
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:23,289
Maybe if we water it,
it'll grow into a building.

8
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:26,025
So now my challenge
is to find a way to move it

9
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,795
without spending money or
straining everything
I care about.

10
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,202
Now, I could ask
my friends to help,

11
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,071
but they're going
to want a payback someday.

12
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,173
So instead I'm just going
to use my extension ladder

13
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:43,276
and this power RV jack.

14
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:46,212
These things go up and down
at a moment's notice.

15
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,448
Those were the
good ol' days.

16
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:54,487
I mounted the control
for the power jack inside

17
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:57,123
so I can raise and lower
the back end of the car,

18
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:59,259
kind of a high-jacking.

19
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:02,829
I attached my extension
ladder to the top of the car

20
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:06,165
with the adjusting rope
hanging down through
the sunroof.

21
00:01:06,165 --> 00:01:08,501
Now, if you'll excuse me,

22
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,837
I've been called
to the bench.

Big, big, big week
up at the lodge this week.

30
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:18,204
They're having
a folk art convention

31
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:19,972
down at the
community centre.

32
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:23,743
See this?
This is called folk art.

33
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,478
Actually, this is
a chunk of wood

34
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,413
that fell out of a
tree into a lake somewhere,

35
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:30,216
got bashed around by the waves
and got washed up on shore.

36
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:32,418
It was picked up by some
old hippy on his way home

37
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:35,021
from a Joan Baez concert.

38
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,223
He throws 29 cents worth
of urethane on it,

39
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:41,661
sells it at the
flea market for $79.95.

40
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,262
So I'm thinking,

41
00:02:43,262 --> 00:02:46,699
hey, this is a rip-off,
and we're not in on it!

I found
this in my bed

44
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:52,405
and now my bed is all
soaking wet.

45
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:55,408
Oh, sure, blame it
on the driftwood.

46
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,977
Come on, my room stinks
now like the bilge

47

Peterson's boat.

Oh, sure, blame it

49

I got a B+ is art.
This is not art.

52
00:03:10,923 --> 00:03:13,559
This is a piece
of grungy firewood.

53
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:14,860
And judging by
it's oily coating,

54
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,263
I'd judge it's out
of Possum Lake.

55
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,564
Yes, all right,
fine.

56
00:03:18,564 --> 00:03:20,800
But once we dry out
and varnish it, Harold,

57
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,335
it's going to be worth
a small fortune

for crap like this.

Well, I don't know, I can't
hear it over that shirt.

141
00:07:04,823 --> 00:07:06,591
I'm just trying
to prove a point

142
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:07,926
that there's a connection,
a correlation

143
00:07:07,926 --> 00:07:09,528
between a man
and his hobby,

sort of.

00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:13,065
Well, not
this hobby, no.

It's an old slot car set

around in circles,

are burned out.

like me at all.

Of course not, no.

152
00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:31,950
I'm just saying that,
you know, well,

153
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,619
maybe you could just
tell us a bit about
the cars.

154
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:36,855
Maybe their make
and their model.

155
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:40,826
Okay, well, that's
referred to as
the green one.

156
00:07:40,826 --> 00:07:43,528
That'd be the yellow one,
that one there.

157
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:46,264
And specifically what
is it that you like
about slot cars?

Oh, well, actually,
I control them both

00:07:49,534 --> 00:07:52,838
so, you know,
I never lose,
which is good.

160
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:55,807
And I like that electrical
smell that you can smell.

161
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:56,842
Yeah, yeah.

162
00:07:56,842 --> 00:07:58,610
And I like that you
don't have to steer them.

163
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,011
You just let 'em go.
Just let 'em go.

164
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:01,546
That's it.
That's it.

165
00:08:01,546 --> 00:08:03,148
That's it.
The letting go.
What?

166
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:04,783
Yeah, you like to let
things go, your person.

167
00:08:04,783 --> 00:08:07,085
I don't have a person,
I have a bouvier.

168
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:10,021
I let her go wherever
it wants, actually.

169
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:12,424
I have proven
my point.
What?

170
00:08:12,424 --> 00:08:15,260
A man in a rut.
A car in a slot.

171
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,862
A lifetime of
letting things go.

172
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:19,431
A psychological connection
between a man and his hobby.

173
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:21,600
Thank you, Glen.

174
00:08:24,536 --> 00:08:25,804
So we're done then?

175
00:08:25,804 --> 00:08:27,539
I'm letting you go.
Okay.

176
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:30,842
[ APPLAUSE ]

177
00:08:33,178 --> 00:08:35,447
You know, there's a lot
of talk these days

178
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:37,816
about gas mileage
and engine efficiency

179
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:39,918
and all that crap.

180
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:41,386
If you ask me,

181
00:08:41,386 --> 00:08:43,922
the best way to save gas
on a trip is to not go.

182
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:45,490
But of course,
if you're married,

183
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,992
you have to go.

184
00:08:46,992 --> 00:08:49,894
So what you need is a way
to make trips fun.

185
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:53,765
Rather than focus
on miles per gallon,

186
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:55,734
think about
gallons per hour.

187
00:08:55,734 --> 00:08:58,637
'Cause to me, burning a lot
of gas for a few minutes

188
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:00,505
has got to be the same

189
00:09:00,505 --> 00:09:02,774
as burning a little bit
of gas for a whole hour.

190
00:09:02,774 --> 00:09:04,342
Now, this is
a carburetor.

191
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:06,845
It controls how much gas
goes into the engine.

192
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:10,048
We're going to increase
the capacity a little
on this unit.

193
00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:12,283
Okay, when you look
inside a carburetor,

194
00:09:12,283 --> 00:09:14,352
you'll see an
open area here

195
00:09:14,352 --> 00:09:15,854
where the gas and air mix

196
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:18,456
and there's the reservoir
which is a small tank
with a float in it

197
00:09:18,456 --> 00:09:21,493
that opens a valve
and lets the gas flow.

198
00:09:21,493 --> 00:09:24,062
Does that remind
you of something?

199
00:09:31,503 --> 00:09:34,706
The toilet drain's a
little large for the
intake manifold,

200
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:37,575
but these toilet gaskets
are pretty flexible.

201
00:09:37,575 --> 00:09:39,411
Made out of beeswax.

202
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:42,113
They're really easy
to work with...

203
00:09:43,748 --> 00:09:45,483
if you're a bee.

204
00:09:45,483 --> 00:09:47,685
I had to increase the
size of the gas line

205
00:09:47,685 --> 00:09:49,954
to my new porcelain
carburetor.

206
00:09:49,954 --> 00:09:51,956
So I went with
3/4" copper.

207
00:09:51,956 --> 00:09:54,259
My wife always says,
Go with the flow.

208
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:56,060
I will.

209
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,163
Now, to control
the whole unit,

210
00:09:58,163 --> 00:10:00,064
I ran a piece of wire
from the flush handle

211
00:10:00,064 --> 00:10:01,866
down through the firewall,

212
00:10:01,866 --> 00:10:03,801
hooked it onto the top edge
of my gas pedal.

213
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:06,504
So if you find
she's idling too fast,

214
00:10:06,504 --> 00:10:08,606
just jiggle the handle.

215
00:10:11,442 --> 00:10:14,212
Pretty sharp looking,
isn't it?

216
00:10:14,212 --> 00:10:16,915
I call it
a kybo charger.

217
00:10:16,915 --> 00:10:18,583
I just hooked up
the fuel pump

218
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,052
and I'm waiting for the
tank to fill up.

219
00:10:23,855 --> 00:10:27,425
Okay, they say the proof
of the pudding is in
the eating.

220
00:10:27,425 --> 00:10:30,328
Maybe that's not
the best analogy.

221
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:34,699
Hey, wait a minute,
this is a man's car.

222
00:10:38,503 --> 00:10:41,606
So remember, if women
don't find you handsome,

223
00:10:41,606 --> 00:10:44,208
they should at least
find you handy.

224
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,646
And they'll
find me gone.

225
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,765
I read in the paper
about a company

226
00:11:07,765 --> 00:11:09,801
whose stock price
just plunged lower

227
00:11:09,801 --> 00:11:12,537
than Pamela
Anderson's neckline.

228
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:16,040
They may even go bust.

229
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,576
Well, naturally, people are
pretty ticked off

230
00:11:18,576 --> 00:11:20,511
but this spokesman guy said

231
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:23,781
it was merely a necessary,
temporary market adjustment.

232
00:11:23,781 --> 00:11:26,417
This is called P.R.

233
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:29,687
If you're a shareholder,
it's called B.S.

234
00:11:29,687 --> 00:11:32,924
Personally,
I call it genius.

235
00:11:32,924 --> 00:11:35,493
All of us middle-aged,
married guys need
a crash course

236
00:11:35,493 --> 00:11:37,628
in this kind
of public relations.

237
00:11:37,628 --> 00:11:38,830
Think about it.

238
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,632
Your wife catches you
asleep instead of
mowing the lawn.

239
00:11:41,632 --> 00:11:43,434
That's not a nap,

240
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:47,839
that's a personal rejuvenation
efficiency enhancement.

241
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,143
Got nailed eyeing another
woman in the supermarket?

242
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:58,482
You were merely engaged
in benign comparative
product appraisal.

243
00:12:00,184 --> 00:12:02,920
Used your wife's best
China bowl as an ashtray

00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,488
at your poker game?

245
00:12:04,488 --> 00:12:08,626
Sounds like value-added
asset re-purposing to me.

246
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:12,029
So let's all give this P.R.
business some serious thought.

247
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:14,465
You didn't put the dishwasher
back together wrong,

248
00:12:14,465 --> 00:12:16,534
you restructured it.

249
00:12:16,534 --> 00:12:18,302
You didn't
break the lamp,

250
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:20,071
you downsized it.

251
00:12:20,071 --> 00:12:22,139
And if you're really
in trouble,

252
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:24,342
go for the ultimate
public relations ploy...

We've turned them into
something a little
more valuable.

problem is, Harold?

You don't have the class
or sophistication

know about child labour laws.

First prize is 25 gallons
worth of gas,

which went up in
value every minute.

Bill, you're on the wrong
side of the start line.

seconds to blow by Dalton.

314

They get going so fast
they didn't notice

315
00:15:14,878 --> 00:15:16,947
that the track actually
has a turn in it.

316
00:15:21,552 --> 00:15:24,388
On the other hand,
Dalton was well aware
of where he was going,

317
00:15:24,388 --> 00:15:27,658
so he could just
keep poking along.

318
00:15:27,658 --> 00:15:29,092
Get on it, boys.

319
00:15:29,092 --> 00:15:31,161
But we're dealing again
with the powerful machines.

320
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:32,996
It doesn't take long
to catch up to him,

321
00:15:32,996 --> 00:15:34,932
and they got him right
at the mogul there,

322
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:37,734
and they hit it good,
maybe a little too good.

323
00:15:37,734 --> 00:15:42,105
Yeah, that's
unfortunate.

324
00:15:42,105 --> 00:15:43,774
And away we go, again.

325
00:15:43,774 --> 00:15:45,075
Now, here again...

326
00:15:45,075 --> 00:15:46,376
I think there's
a left-hand turn --

327
00:15:46,376 --> 00:15:47,611
a left-hand turn --

left-hand turn.

That's Bill.

I guess Winston went
right through on his --

333
00:15:56,954 --> 00:15:58,889
yeah, he did,
there he is.

334
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:01,692
He's back.
And Bill -- oh, oww.

335
00:16:01,692 --> 00:16:03,760
All right, Bill thought
he'd try fencing.

336
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:07,664
Yeah, there you go.

337
00:16:07,664 --> 00:16:10,133
And this time they're
getting pretty close
to the finish line.

338
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:12,603
They blow past Dalton
again, no problem.

339
00:16:12,603 --> 00:16:13,670
But then the machine --

340
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,539
I'm getting a little bored
of this at this point.

341
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:17,708
But their machine's
still acting up,

342
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,409
and Bill can't figure out --

343
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:20,911
and then Winston looks
and there's the problem,

344
00:16:20,911 --> 00:16:22,412
you're about
out of gas there.

345
00:16:22,412 --> 00:16:24,147
And then Winston starts
doing --

346
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:26,316
he's actually got
less gas in his.

347
00:16:26,316 --> 00:16:28,418
The thing is, can they
make it to the finish line?

348
00:16:28,418 --> 00:16:31,421
They try humping and bumping
and humping along.

349
00:16:31,421 --> 00:16:34,491
And Bill decided he's going
to try and move the
finish line up.

350
00:16:34,491 --> 00:16:37,627
Well, that's just
not acceptable.

351
00:16:37,627 --> 00:16:40,664
So then, Winston's going
to grab some of first prize

352
00:16:40,664 --> 00:16:42,833
so they can
finish the race,

353
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,201
and then there's
an argument

354
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:46,837
and Dalton wins
the whole deal.
