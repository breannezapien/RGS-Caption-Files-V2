00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:06,740
(Cement truck backing up)

2
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:10,643
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

3
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:13,346
HERE'S THE MAN WHO KNOWS THE
MEANING OF "SELF-SUFFICIENT",

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,647
IF NOT THE SPELLING...

5
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:18,084
MY UNCLE, YOUR HOST, RED GREEN!

6
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,320
(Applause and cheering)

7
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:23,323

00:00:23,389 --> 00:00:25,225

00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,761
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,330
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

11
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:31,931
WE WERE GOING THROUGH

12
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,500

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,635
"WITH OVERSIZED ENGINES" TRADER

14
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:38,138
AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

15
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,340
WE DECIDED THAT WE NEED

16
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:41,875
TO BROADEN OUR INTERESTS
A LITTLE BIT.

17
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,077
OH, EXCELLENT!

18
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:46,446
I WAS THINKING OF STARTING
A CHESS CLUB.

19
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,781
YOU GO RIGHT AHEAD, HAROLD.

20
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:50,817
SO THE BUNCH OF US

21
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:51,985
ARE GONNA MAKE AN INVESTMENT.

22
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:54,454
WE'RE GETTING OURSELVES
A SUBMARINE.

23
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:55,955
A SUBMARINE.

24
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:58,324
G-G-GONNA GET YOURSELVES
A SUBMARINE.

25
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,659

00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,428
WE'VE ORDERED THE CONCRETE
FOR THE SUBMARINE PEN.

27
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,998
WE'LL CHARGE PEOPLE MONEY
TO TAKE 'EM ON SUBMARINE RIDES,

28
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,232
MAYBE FIND BURIED TREASURE,

29
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,167
AND GENERALLY

30
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:11,004
YOU'RE HALFWAY THERE.

31
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,338
ALL YOU NEED
IS THE "RICH" PART.

32
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,974
(Audience laughing)

33
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:20,013
(Horns honking)

34
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,049
(Geese honking)

35
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,786
(Quacking)

36
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,958
(Red): WE GOT
A JAM-PACKED SHOW.

37
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:33,860
I'M GONNA BUILD A HOVERCRAFT.

38
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,895
RANGER GORD IS GONNA CRY OUT

39
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,797
FOR LAND WHALES.

40
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:39,465
GARTH HARBLE'S GONNA SHOW YOU

41
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:41,367
HOW TO CONTROL YOUR SKUNK,

42
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,002
AND HAROLD'S GONNA GET

43
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,570
UNDER THE COVERS.

44
00:01:47,473 --> 00:01:50,076
WE'RE ALL GETTING EXCITED
ABOUT THIS SUBMARINE THING.

45
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,178
WE'VE ORDERED LUMBER
AND A TON OF CONCRETE

46
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,780
TO MAKE THE SUBMARINE PEN.

47
00:01:53,846 --> 00:01:56,482
WE'RE PUTTING MONEY BACK
INTO THE COMMUNITY.

48
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,484
PROVIDING YOU PAY YOUR BILLS.

49
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,255
WE WILL WHEN
WE START MAKING MONEY.

50
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,924
WE'LL CHARGE PEOPLE FOR RIDES
LIKE THEY DO AT DISNEYWORLD.

51
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,492
TAKE 'EM DOWN
TO "UNDERSEA WORLD".

52
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:07,994
WE'LL HAVE SCENES
OF SUNKEN SHIPS

53
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,429
AND MERMAIDS AND SHARKS

54
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:11,998
AND FORMER MEMBERS
OF THE TEAMSTERS UNION.

55
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,499
(Audience laughing)

56
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:16,769
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO SPEND ANY MONEY.

57
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:19,939
MOST OF YOUR BOATS
ARE ALREADY SUBMARINES.

58
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,274
NO, NO, NO, NO.

59
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,209
I'M KEEPING THE BUDGET IN MIND.

60
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,478
IF WE CAN'T AFFORD A SUB
FROM RUSSIA,

61
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,780
WE'LL GET A STEEL CORN BIN
FROM IOWA.

62
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,484
YOU GUYS SCARE ME
WHEN YOU START BUYING STUFF.

63
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,686
REMEMBER THAT TIME YOU BOUGHT

64
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:36,055
THAT ROCKET-POWERED R.V.
OUT OF THAT MAGAZINE?

65
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:39,525
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN YOU STARTED IT UP?

66
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:40,860
SO WHAT?

67
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,962
IT WAS FIRECRACKER DAY ANYWAY.

68
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,164
NOBODY HEARD ANY COMPLAINTS.

69
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:46,999
WE WERE ALL DEAF FOR A WEEK!

70
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,802
HEY, THAT SAVED MY MARRIAGE.

71
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:52,572
(Applause)

72
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,308
(Red): OH, BOY.

73
00:02:55,374 --> 00:02:57,743
HAROLD AND BILL
HAVE A PROJECT GOING.

74
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,312
THEY WANTED ME TO HELP.

75
00:02:59,378 --> 00:03:01,981
THEY HAD LUMBER
AND HAROLD'S GONNA SIT--

76
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:03,916
NO, HAROLD, WATCH OUT.

77
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,985
OH, BOY, OH, BOY, OH, BOY.

78
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,520
I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION.

79
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:08,988
DIDN'T NOTICE THE BOARD.

80
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:12,258
THEY DIDN'T NOTICE
THE BOARD WAS MISSING.

81
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,127
OK, NOW, THIS IS THE BIG ONE!

82
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:18,998
FOR A FREE HAIRSTYLE AND MOUSSE
FROM ED'S TAXIDERMY--

83
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,000
THAT ISN'T RIGHT, IS IT?

84
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,501
OH!

85
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:24,503
IT'S FOR A FREE
ANY-STYLE
 HARE
 OR

86
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,138
FROM ED'S TAXIDERMY.

87
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,773
THAT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

88
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,676
UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO GET MR. FRANKLIN

89
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,244
TO SAY THIS WORD.

90
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,015
THIRTY SECONDS, AND GO!

91
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,484
ALL RIGHT, UH,
HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCE.

92
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,286
WIDE-SCREEN T.V.
WITH A BUILT-IN V.C.R.

93
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,788
NO, FOR CLEANING.

94
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,123
CLEANING.

95
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,458
YEAH, CLEANING.

96
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:46,959
UH... NO.

97
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:49,228
CLEANING, DOUG.
CLEANING.

98
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,563
IT'S FOR CLEANING.

99
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:51,864
GIVE ME ANOTHER CLUE.

100
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,899
FOR CLEANING THE FLOOR.

101
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:55,868
UH, OLD UNDERWEAR.

102
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,203
(Audience laughing)

103
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:59,905
A WOMAN USES THIS
TO CLEAN THE HOUSE.

104
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:01,974
AIR FRESHENER.

105
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,644
THIS THING SUCKS STUFF UP
OFF THE FLOOR.

106
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:07,780
OH, A DOG.

107
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:11,717
NO, THIS SUCKS EVERYTHING UP --
DIRT, LINT, DUST, EVERYTHING.

108
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,719
A BABY?

109
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:16,689
YOU'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME,
UNCLE RED.

110
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:19,558
YOUR MONSTER TRUCK SUCKS MONEY
OUT OF YOUR WALLET LIKE A...

111
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,494
A VACUUM.
THERE WE GO.

112
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,063
(Applause)

113
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,331
(Strums acoustic guitar)

114
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,867
OH, LATELY

115
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:30,903
THE HEALTH-CONSCIOUS
FANATICS HAVE TRIED

116
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,173
TO STOP US FROM EATING
ANYTHING FRIED

117
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,510
FRENCH FRIES AND ONION RINGS
AND BACON AND MORE BACON

118
00:04:37,576 --> 00:04:38,844
LOTS OF BACON.

119
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:40,346
A LOT OF BACON IN THERE.

120
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:43,015
THEY TELL US THE GREASE
WILL GET OUR HEART ACHIN'

121
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:47,119
BUT I DO BELIEVE
THEY'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG

122
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:50,956
WITHOUT ANY LUBRICANT,
NOTHIN' RUNS VERY LONG

123
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:55,461
IF YOU WORK ON AN ENGINE,
YOU'LL SOON UNDERSTAND

124
00:04:55,527 --> 00:04:57,463
THAT THE WHOLE THING
SEIZES UP

125
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:00,966
IF YOU'VE GOT NO OIL
IN YOUR PAN

126
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:02,635
OH!

127
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:04,036
HE SLIPPED.

128
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:07,473
RANGER GORD?

129
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:08,974
RANGER GORD?

130
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,476
HI, RED.

131
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:11,977
GEE!
SHHH!

132
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:14,480
I'M LISTENING
TO THE SOUNDS OF NATURE.

133
00:05:14,546 --> 00:05:15,981
YOU HEAR THAT?

134
00:05:16,048 --> 00:05:17,983
THAT'S A LAND WHALE.

135
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,318
A LAND WHALE?

136
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:21,220
RIGHT, AND THAT'S
THE EERIE SONG

137
00:05:21,286 --> 00:05:22,988
OF THE BEAUTIFUL LAND WHALE.

138
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:24,490
(Buzzing)

139
00:05:24,556 --> 00:05:26,992
SOUNDS LIKE A CICADA.

140
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:28,694
RIGHT, CICADA, CICADA.

141
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:31,830
I'VE BEEN UP HERE SO LONG,
I FORGOT THE WORD.

142
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:33,165
CICADA, CICADA.

143
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,500
THAT'S IT.

144
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:36,502
OH, LISTEN --
I KNOW THAT VOICE.

145
00:05:36,568 --> 00:05:38,504
THAT'S LARRY THE LAND WHALE...

146
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,507
OR -- YOUR FANCY WORD --
CICADA.

147
00:05:41,573 --> 00:05:44,943
HE SAID, "HEY,
IS ANYONE... THERE?"

148
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,946
BEGINNING TO WONDER
THE SAME THING MYSELF, GORD.

149
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:49,281
OH, LISTEN.

150
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,616
THAT'S GERTA.

151
00:05:50,682 --> 00:05:53,318
SHE SAYS, "YES,
AND DOES ANYONE KNOW

152
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:55,721
"IF ASHLEY HAS LEFT BRETT YET?"

153
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,423
ASHLEY HAS LEFT BRETT?

154
00:05:57,489 --> 00:05:58,891
WHAT IS THAT, GORD?

155
00:05:58,957 --> 00:06:01,927
THEY'RE NOT PARTICULARLY
BRIGHT ANIMALS.

156
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,962
THEY WATCH A LOT OF SOAPS.

157
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:05,464
OH, OH.

158
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,965
(Buzzing)

159
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:08,467
OH, EXCUSE ME.

160
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,470
HAVE TO TELL THEM SOMETHING.

161
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:19,478
(Imitating cicada)

162
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,980
(Buzzing stops)

163
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:23,482
WHAT HAPPENED THERE, GORD?

164
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,484
I TOLD THEM IT WAS 12:30.

165
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,986
WHY DID THAT MAKE THEM SHUT UP?

166
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:30,989
"THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS"
STARTS AT 12:30.

167
00:06:31,056 --> 00:06:32,324
OH!

168
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:35,194
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO
TELL THEM THAT EVERY DAY.

169
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,995
I HAVE TO REMIND THEM
EVERY DAY.

170
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:38,497
THEY'RE A LITTLE...

171
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,998
YEAH, YEAH.

172
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:43,435
WONDER WHAT MAKES THEM GO
LIKE THAT.

173
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:46,438
LIVING UP HERE,
I WOULD SAY, GORD.

174
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:47,940
OH, YEAH.

175
00:06:48,006 --> 00:06:50,509
YEAH, FOR SURE.

176
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,578
YOU KNOW, THE FIRST
CONSIDERATION

177
00:06:52,644 --> 00:06:55,013
FOR THIS SUBMARINE RIDE
WE'RE BUILDING

178
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,548
WOULD HAVE TO BE "FUN".

179
00:06:56,615 --> 00:06:58,984
THEN COMES POPULARITY;
NEXT COMES COST,

180
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,653
BUT EVENTUALLY
WE'LL GET AROUND TO SAFETY.

181
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,089
I'LL TAKE THIS WEEK'S
"HANDYMAN CORNER"

182
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:07,025
TO SHOW YOU HOW TO BUILD
YOUR OWN RESCUE BOAT.

183
00:07:07,092 --> 00:07:09,828
THE PROBLEM WITH THE BOATS
UP HERE, THOUGH,

184
00:07:09,895 --> 00:07:11,830
IS THAT THEY'RE ALWAYS SINKING

185
00:07:11,897 --> 00:07:14,232
OR RUNNING OUT OF POWER
OR EXPLODING.

186
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:16,902
WE HAVE TO TAKE BETTER CARE
OF OUR BOATS,

187
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:18,370
OR BUILD A HOVERCRAFT.

188
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:20,739
YOU CAN GUESS WHICH WAY
I'M LEANING.

189
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:22,174
THIS OLD UNIT HERE

190
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,544
IS GONNA BECOME THE BASIS
OF MY HOVERCRAFT.

191
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,380
IF YOU GET YOURSELF
A STORE-BOUGHT HOVERCRAFT,

192
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:30,215
THEY COME WITH A RUBBER SKIRT

193
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:32,317
TO KEEP THE AIR
FROM BLOWING AWAY.

194
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:34,419
IF YOU HAVE
YOUR OWN RUBBER SKIRT,

195
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:35,987
WELL, THAT'S YOUR BUSINESS.

196
00:07:36,054 --> 00:07:37,489
I'M NOT ONE TO JUDGE.

197
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:41,126
FOR ME, I'LL HAVE TO USE
WHATEVER I CAN FIND

198
00:07:41,193 --> 00:07:42,928
THAT'S RUBBER AND BIG.

199
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:44,496
HAROLD?

200
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,166
I GOT MY RUBBER STUFF
DUCT-TAPED

201
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:50,602
TO THE GUNNELS
ALL THE WAY AROUND.

202
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:54,739
I SUPPOSE SOME OF THOSE ITEMS
ARE NOT TECHNICALLY RUBBER

203
00:07:54,806 --> 00:07:57,943
BUT I'M NOT TECHNICALLY
A BOAT-BUILDER SO THAT'S A FIT.

204
00:07:58,009 --> 00:07:59,344
ALLS YOU HAVE TO DO IS

205
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:02,047
GET YOUR CAPTAIN'S CHAIR
MOUNTED ON THERE

206
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,182
AND SOME SOURCE
OF A COMPRESSED GAS

207
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:05,884
AND YOU CAN START HOVERING.

208
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:08,286
PEOPLE ARE GONNA SIT UP
AND TAKE NOTICE

209
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:10,956
WHEN YOU COME DOWN THE LAKE
IN THIS UNIT...

210
00:08:11,022 --> 00:08:15,260
ESPECIALLY IF YOU GET SIDEWAYS
GOING INTO THE RAPIDS.

211
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:16,761
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS

212
00:08:16,828 --> 00:08:19,631
PULL THE TRIGGER
ON THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER.

213
00:08:19,698 --> 00:08:22,567
THE CO2 GAS GOES THROUGH
THE HOLE IN THE HULL,

214
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:26,471
BUILDS UP PRESSURE, LIFTS ME
OFF THE GROUND, AND AWAY WE GO.

215
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:29,207
THEN I CONTROL THE STEERING
BY LEANING,

216
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:32,210
LETTING THE GAS VENT THIS WAY
OR THAT WAY.

217
00:08:32,277 --> 00:08:34,479
WE'VE ALL SEEN THAT
DONE BEFORE.

218
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:36,648
LET'S GIVE 'ER A TRY.

219
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:43,421
SEEMS LIKE WE GOT
A FEW TOO MANY HOLES.

220
00:08:43,488 --> 00:08:46,524
I'M GONNA HAVE TO PATCH THEM
WITH DUCT TAPE,

221
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:49,327
BUT THE TWO-INCH STUFF
ISN'T WIDE ENOUGH.

222
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:50,895
I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

223
00:09:00,438 --> 00:09:02,941
(Grunting)

224
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:06,544
ALL RIGHT, I'VE TURNED MY BOAT
INTO AN ALUMINUM HULL.

225
00:09:06,611 --> 00:09:08,947
I GOT MY RESCUE EQUIPMENT
ON BOARD.

226
00:09:09,014 --> 00:09:10,949
GOT THE FLASHLIGHT...

227
00:09:11,016 --> 00:09:14,452
AND I GOT MY WALKIE-TALKIE
SAFETY RESCUE UNIT...

228
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,954
AND MY LIFE-SAVING RING.

229
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:17,455
I'M ALL SET TO GO.

230
00:09:17,522 --> 00:09:19,991
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

231
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:21,960
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

232
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:24,029
TIME TO CAST OFF!

233
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:30,201
(Farting noise)

234
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:33,538
THIS IS
THE RESCUE BOAT -- HELP!

235
00:09:33,605 --> 00:09:35,673
OH, WHAT A TANGLED WEB WE WEAVE

236
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,042
WHEN FIRST WE PRACTICE
TO DECEIVE.

237
00:09:42,147 --> 00:09:45,817
WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING
THAT CONCERNS FOLKS OUR AGE.

238
00:09:45,884 --> 00:09:48,353
OH, YEAH -- MEMORY LOSS.

239
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:49,788
WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE,

240
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:52,490
FROWNING IN THE MIDDLE
OF A PARKING LOT,

241
00:09:52,557 --> 00:09:55,426
TRYING TO REMEMBER
WHERE WE PARKED THE CAR,

242
00:09:55,493 --> 00:09:57,228
OR WHICH CAR DID WE BRING?

243
00:09:57,295 --> 00:09:59,330
WAS IT THE SEDAN OR THE WAGON?

244
00:09:59,397 --> 00:10:01,332
DO WE STILL HAVE THE SEDAN?

245
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,834
DIDN'T WE BUY A VAN?

246
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:04,335
(Audience laughing)

247
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:07,305
A LOT OF US ARE WORRIED
ABOUT LOSING OUR MEMORY

248
00:10:07,372 --> 00:10:09,841
BECAUSE WE THINK WE REMEMBER
HAVING ONE.

249
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:13,144
THE TRUTH IS, WE NEVER DID
REMEMBER STUFF REAL WELL.

250
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:15,213
YOU REMEMBER YOURSELF
BEING FUNNY

251
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,848
OR SMART OR GOOD-LOOKIN'?

252
00:10:16,915 --> 00:10:19,450
NOT ONLY HAVE YOU LOST
YOUR
 MEMORY,

253
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:21,853
YOU'VE PICKED UP
SOMEBODY ELSE'S.

254
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,288
BUT THAT'S A GOOD THING.

255
00:10:23,354 --> 00:10:25,023
IT'S BETTER TO REMEMBER THINGS

256
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:27,091
AS BEING BETTER
THAN WHAT HAPPENED.

257
00:10:27,158 --> 00:10:28,793
NATURE DOES THAT ON PURPOSE.

258
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,796
OTHERWISE, NOBODY WOULD HAVE
MORE THAN ONE KID

259
00:10:31,863 --> 00:10:33,131
OR GET REMARRIED

260
00:10:33,197 --> 00:10:35,800
OR KEEP CHEERING FOR
THE TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS.

261
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:37,302
(Audience): OHHHH!

262
00:10:37,368 --> 00:10:38,803
SO...

263
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,606
IF YOU'VE FORGOTTEN
YOU'RE FORGETFUL, FORGET IT.

264
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:44,042
IF YOU REMEMBER ONE THING,
REMEMBER THIS:

265
00:10:44,108 --> 00:10:45,643
I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

266
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,812
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

267
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,814
(Applause)

268
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:54,152
OH, CHEER UP, HAROLD.

269
00:10:54,218 --> 00:10:57,055
I DIDN'T KNOW A SUBMARINE
WOULD BE THAT EXPENSIVE,

270
00:10:57,121 --> 00:10:58,489
NOT EVEN A RUSSIAN ONE.

271
00:10:58,556 --> 00:11:01,392
WAY OUT OF OUR PRICE RANGE.

272
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:04,662
FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS
HAVE FORCED ME, UNFORTUNATELY,

273
00:11:04,729 --> 00:11:07,131
TO CANCEL THE ENTIRE
SUBMARINE PROJECT.

274
00:11:07,198 --> 00:11:09,934
JUNIOR'S WIFE HAD ALREADY MADE
A FAKE SHARK.

275
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:13,304
SHE'LL TURN THAT INTO
A BEAN-BAG LOVE SEAT WITH FINS.

276
00:11:13,371 --> 00:11:15,206
(Audience laughing)

277
00:11:15,273 --> 00:11:17,175
OLD MAN SEDGWICK HAS SENT BACK

278
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:19,277
THE MERMAID COSTUMES...
EXCEPT ONE.

279
00:11:19,343 --> 00:11:22,680
(Audience laughing)

280
00:11:22,747 --> 00:11:24,449
WE'VE CANCELLED ALL THE LUMBER

281
00:11:24,515 --> 00:11:27,752
AND I GOT HAROLD TO CANCEL
THE 15 TRUCKLOADS OF CEMENT.

282
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:29,787
I'M GONNA DO
A BOAT THING--

283
00:11:29,854 --> 00:11:31,589
UNCLE RED, UH...

284
00:11:31,656 --> 00:11:34,792
YOU DIDN'T SAY "CANCEL
THE 15 TRUCKLOADS OF CEMENT."

285
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:36,127
YES, I DID, HAROLD.

286
00:11:36,194 --> 00:11:40,298
NO, NO, NO,
WHAT YOU SAID WAS...

287
00:11:40,364 --> 00:11:41,632
(Crying)

288
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:44,802
OH, I GOTTA CANCEL
THOSE TRUCKLOADS OF CEMENT.

289
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:46,804
ONCE THEY GET HERE...

290
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:48,306
(Trucks
backing up)

291
00:11:48,372 --> 00:11:49,807
OHHHH...

292
00:11:49,874 --> 00:11:51,309
(Signals
beeping)

293
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,811
THEY'RE HERE.

294
00:11:53,878 --> 00:11:56,380
THERE'S 15 TRUCKLOADS
OF CEMENT--

295
00:11:56,447 --> 00:11:58,482
I SAID HAVE A CHESS CLUB!

296
00:11:59,817 --> 00:12:01,853
GARTH HARBLE HERE,
ANIMAL CONTROL,

297
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,922
WITH ANOTHER FEATURE
ON CONTROLLING YOUR ANIMALS.

298
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:07,825
AND SPEAKING OF ANIMALS,
COME ON IN HERE, RED.

299
00:12:07,892 --> 00:12:09,327
(Laughing)

300
00:12:09,393 --> 00:12:11,329
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR EAR?

301
00:12:11,395 --> 00:12:12,830
OH, NOTHING SERIOUS.

302
00:12:12,897 --> 00:12:15,833
THEY SAY CHICKENS CAN'T FLY,
BUT THEY SURE CAN JUMP.

303
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,168
WOW.

304
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:18,836
EVER BEEN PECKED IN THE EAR?

305
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:20,838
NOT BY A CHICKEN.

306
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:22,340
OOH.

307
00:12:22,406 --> 00:12:25,776
YOU KNOW, RED, 19 YEARS,
11 MONTHS, AND 2 DAYS,

308
00:12:25,843 --> 00:12:27,111
AND I'M RETIRED.

309
00:12:27,178 --> 00:12:28,446
WOW!

310
00:12:28,512 --> 00:12:31,682
I'M GONNA FAX A PICTURE
OF MY BUTT TO MY BOSS

311
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:33,117
AND HE CAN KISS IT.

312
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:36,187
TODAY, WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT CONTROLLING SKUNKS.

313
00:12:36,253 --> 00:12:39,290
TODAY, WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT CONTROLLING SKUNKS.

314
00:12:39,357 --> 00:12:40,625
I JUST SAID THAT.

315
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:41,959
ALL RIGHT, GO ON.

316
00:12:42,026 --> 00:12:44,829
NEVER TRY TO CATCH A SKUNK
WITH YOUR BARE HANDS.

317
00:12:44,895 --> 00:12:46,230
THEY'VE GOT SHARP TEETH

318
00:12:46,297 --> 00:12:49,000
AND THEY'LL CLAMP DOWN
ON YOUR ACHILLES TENDON

319
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:50,801
AND YOU'RE THERE FOR THE DAY.

320
00:12:50,868 --> 00:12:52,169
YOU GOTTA USE A TRAP.

321
00:12:52,236 --> 00:12:54,105
MAKE SURE IT'S A PROPER TRAP.

322
00:12:54,171 --> 00:12:57,675
DON'T LASSO THEM OR SCOOP THEM
INTO A GREEN GARBAGE BAG

323
00:12:57,742 --> 00:13:00,478
OR STARTLE THEM INTO HAVING
A HEART ATTACK.

324
00:13:00,544 --> 00:13:01,812
BOO!

325
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:04,315
BECAUSE THEY'LL JUST...

326
00:13:04,382 --> 00:13:06,484
THAT'S RIGHT,
AND TRUST ME -- I KNOW.

327
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,818
THAT'S RIGHT.

328
00:13:07,885 --> 00:13:11,322
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
TO AVOID GETTING SQUIRTED.

329
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:13,324
(Squirting)

330
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:14,892
SEE?

331
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:19,163
SO MAKE SURE
THAT IT'S A PROPER TRAP.

332
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,999
A PROPER TRAP
WILL PUT THE TAIL DOWN.

333
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:25,269
THAT PRETTY MUCH
PUTS THEM OUT OF BUSINESS.

334
00:13:25,336 --> 00:13:26,771
RIGHT, I SEE.

335
00:13:26,837 --> 00:13:28,906
THEN YOU JUST
TAKE 'EM SOMEPLACE,

336
00:13:28,973 --> 00:13:31,709
SAY, LIKE YOUR BOSS'S HOUSE,
AND LET 'EM GO.

337
00:13:31,776 --> 00:13:33,944
OK, WHY DON'T YOU TELL
OUR VIEWERS

338
00:13:34,011 --> 00:13:37,781
HOW CAN THEY TELL IF THEY HAVE
A SKUNK AROUND THEIR PLACE?

339
00:13:37,848 --> 00:13:39,116
REALLY, RED?

340
00:13:39,183 --> 00:13:41,285
YEAH, JUST... YEAH.

341
00:13:41,352 --> 00:13:43,787
SAY YOUR NOSE FALLS OFF, RED.

342
00:13:43,854 --> 00:13:45,122
I SEE, YEAH.

343
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:47,291
LOOK FOR HOLES
AROUND THE FOUNDATION.

344
00:13:47,358 --> 00:13:48,859
OH, LIKE THAT THERE?

345
00:13:48,926 --> 00:13:52,796
LIKE THAT HOLE YOU GOT THERE
BY YOUR HOUSE, THERE.

346
00:13:52,863 --> 00:13:54,298
(Skunk
panting)

347
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:56,800
PRETTY MUCH EXACTLY LIKE THAT.

348
00:13:56,867 --> 00:13:58,302
OH!

349
00:13:58,369 --> 00:14:00,137
(Skunk
panting)

350
00:14:00,204 --> 00:14:02,306
OH, BOY.

351
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:04,141
ANOTHER SUPER DAY.

352
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:11,882
(Squirting)

353
00:14:14,118 --> 00:14:15,552
HI, RANGER GORD AGAIN.

354
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:17,054
PEOPLE ASK ME,

355
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:21,358
"DOES LIVING ALONE IN A FOREST
FOR 16 YEARS DRIVE YOU CRAZY?"

356
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:24,762
NO, NOT IF YOU FIND WAYS
TO KEEP YOURSELF BUSY.

357
00:14:24,828 --> 00:14:26,263
(Laughing)

358
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,765
FOOLED YA!

359
00:14:27,831 --> 00:14:29,466
(Laughing)

360
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:32,136
WELCOME TO
HAROLD'S HANDICRAFTS,

361
00:14:32,202 --> 00:14:35,272
WHERE CRAFTY HANDS
MAKE "HANDI-CRAFTS"!

362
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:38,776
OK, TODAY,
LET'S WEAVE A WOOL BLANKET.

363
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:40,277
WAHHH!

364
00:14:40,344 --> 00:14:43,981
NOW, IF YOU CAN TIE A KNOT,
YOU CAN WEAVE A WOOL BLANKET.

365
00:14:44,048 --> 00:14:45,549
IF YOU CAN'T TIE A KNOT,

366
00:14:45,616 --> 00:14:48,786
YOU PROBABLY MAJORED IN FILM
OR SOMETHING.

367
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:53,123
OK, SO, UH, FIRST, AS ALWAYS,
STEP ONE.

368
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,458
WAH-HA-HA!

369
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:56,260
YOU GOTTA FIND A STICK

370
00:14:56,326 --> 00:14:57,961
AND THEN...

371
00:14:58,028 --> 00:14:59,630
(Laughing nervously)

372
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:00,964
ALL RIGHT.

373
00:15:01,031 --> 00:15:02,800
YES, AND THEN STEP TWO...

374
00:15:02,866 --> 00:15:06,336
YOU TAKE THE WOOL
AND WRAP IT AROUND THE STICK.

375
00:15:06,403 --> 00:15:09,807
AS I SAID, YOU JUST
TIE YOURSELF A KNOT AND...

376
00:15:09,873 --> 00:15:11,241
YOU TIE A KNOT!

377
00:15:11,308 --> 00:15:14,878
THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF
THE ORIGIN OF THE WOOL BLANKET.

378
00:15:16,046 --> 00:15:18,182
THEN YOU CAN MAKE ONE OF THESE.

379
00:15:18,248 --> 00:15:20,317
WHAT YOU DO FROM THIS POINT IS

380
00:15:20,384 --> 00:15:23,086
YOU HAVE TO TIE
ALL THE THREADS TOGETHER

381
00:15:23,153 --> 00:15:24,755
IN A WEAVE-LIKE PATTERN.

382
00:15:24,822 --> 00:15:26,256
AND THEN IT'S, UH...

383
00:15:26,323 --> 00:15:27,758
YOU JUST...

384
00:15:27,825 --> 00:15:29,760
GIDDYUP!

385
00:15:29,827 --> 00:15:32,763
YOU TAKE THEM
AND YOU, UH, TIE THEM TOGETHER

386
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,666
BACK AND FORTH,
BACK AND FORTH...

387
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:39,770
(Laughing)

388
00:15:39,837 --> 00:15:43,774
AND YOU'RE CREATED
YOUR VERY OWN WOOL BLANKET.

389
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:46,276
(Applause)

390
00:15:46,343 --> 00:15:48,278
(Cheering)

391
00:15:48,345 --> 00:15:49,580
JUST REMOVE THE STICK

392
00:15:49,646 --> 00:15:52,115
AND YOU'VE CREATED
A PIONEER-LIKE BLANKET,

393
00:15:52,182 --> 00:15:55,285
FROM THE AUTHENTIC WOOL
DOWN TO THE AUTHENTIC LABEL.

394
00:15:55,352 --> 00:15:56,787
OH, BOY.

395
00:15:56,853 --> 00:15:58,789
(Audience laughing)

396
00:15:58,855 --> 00:16:02,759
THAT'S JUST A TOUCH
I LIKE TO ADD MYSELF.

397
00:16:02,826 --> 00:16:05,262
THE BEST PART IS,
YOU CREATED IT YOURSELF.

398
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:08,799
QUITE AN ACCOMPLISHMENT, IF
YOU JUST TIE WOOL INTO A KNOT.

399
00:16:08,865 --> 00:16:12,803
HOW ABOUT PULLING WOOL
OVER PEOPLE'S EYES, HAROLD?

400
00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:16,306
(Audience laughing)

401
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:20,310
LOOK, UNCLE RED TRIED
AND HE COULDN'T DO IT!

402
00:16:20,377 --> 00:16:21,812
OH, YOU!

403
00:16:21,878 --> 00:16:24,247
(Laughing)

404
00:16:24,314 --> 00:16:26,350
(Applause)

405
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:30,153
WELL, SURE ENOUGH, THERE'S
15 CEMENT TRUCKS OUT THERE

406
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,522
AND THEY'RE NOT FULL
OF CONCRETE.

407
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:35,258
THEY'RE FULL
OF QUICK-DRYING CONCRETE.

408
00:16:35,325 --> 00:16:36,626
IN TWO HOURS,

409
00:16:36,693 --> 00:16:40,263
IT'S GONNA BE HARDER
THAN MOOSE THOMPSON'S FOREHEAD.

410
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,598
I WENT TO THE DRIVERS.

411
00:16:41,665 --> 00:16:43,300
I SAID, "WE MADE A MISTAKE.

412
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:44,968
"YOU GUYS CAN TAKE IT BACK.

413
00:16:45,035 --> 00:16:46,570
"WOULD THAT BE ALL RIGHT?"

414
00:16:46,636 --> 00:16:49,272
I THOUGHT THEY'D BE UPSET,
BUT THEY LAUGHED.

415
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:50,774
OH, THEY LAUGHED!

416
00:16:50,841 --> 00:16:54,277
THEY LAUGHED LIKE THAT,
SO THEN
 WE
 LAUGHED.

417
00:16:54,344 --> 00:16:55,779
WE LAUGHED, WE LAUGHED.

418
00:16:55,846 --> 00:16:58,281
BUT THEN WE STOPPED LAUGHING.

419
00:16:58,348 --> 00:16:59,783
BUT NOT THEM.

420
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,786
THEY KEPT ON LAUGHING
AND LAUGHING...

421
00:17:02,853 --> 00:17:04,321
I FIGURED OUT WHY.

422
00:17:04,387 --> 00:17:07,991
IF WE DON'T TAKE THE CONCRETE
AND IT HARDENS IN THOSE TRUCKS,

423
00:17:08,058 --> 00:17:11,128
WE HAVE TO PAY FOR THE CONCRETE
AND
 NEW TRUCKS.

424
00:17:11,194 --> 00:17:14,264
A LOT OF MEN, WHEN THEY SEE
A PROBLEM LIKE THIS,

425
00:17:14,331 --> 00:17:15,799
TRY TO FIND A SOLUTION.

426
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:18,468
I PREFER TO FIGURE OUT
WHOSE FAULT IT IS

427
00:17:18,535 --> 00:17:20,737
AND THEN LET THEM
TAKE CARE OF IT.

428
00:17:20,804 --> 00:17:25,809
(Audience laughing)

429
00:17:28,145 --> 00:17:31,181
HEY, HANDYMAN,
THIS HERE IS COPPER PIPE.

430
00:17:31,248 --> 00:17:35,685
YOU CONNECT THAT BY PUTTING
SOLDER ON THERE WITH A TORCH.

431
00:17:35,752 --> 00:17:39,089
DOESN'T WORK SO WELL
WITH THE PLASTIC PIPE.

432
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:41,591
(Red): WITH ALL THAT CEMENT
LYING AROUND,

433
00:17:41,658 --> 00:17:44,528
WE'RE GONNA USE THIS WEEK'S
"ADVENTURES WITH BILL"

434
00:17:44,594 --> 00:17:46,763
TO DO SOMETHING
WITH SOME CONCRETE.

435
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,199
BILL'S MAKING
A CONCRETE COFFEE TABLE.

436
00:17:49,266 --> 00:17:51,768
FIRST, HE HAS TO MAKE
THE FORM FOR IT.

437
00:17:51,835 --> 00:17:55,272
THIS IS OUR VERSION
OF PETER, PAUL AND MARY... OH!

438
00:17:55,338 --> 00:17:56,706
"IF I HAD A HEADACHE"...

439
00:17:56,773 --> 00:17:58,108
OH, YOU'RE FINE, HAROLD.

440
00:17:58,174 --> 00:18:00,710
ANYWAY, HE WANTS TO CUT THAT--

441
00:18:00,777 --> 00:18:03,346
HE'S GOT THE ELECTRIC CHAINSAW.

442
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:06,182
I'M A LITTLE BIT CAUTIOUS
ABOUT--

443
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:09,719
YOU SAFETY-CONSCIOUS PEOPLE,
HERE'S SOMETHING NOT TO DO.

444
00:18:09,786 --> 00:18:12,522
DON'T GET ON TOP OF THE WOOD

445
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:14,057
UNLESS YOU'RE SURE

446
00:18:14,124 --> 00:18:15,325
IT CAN SUPPORT YOU.

447
00:18:15,392 --> 00:18:16,826
THE BLADE'S DIGGING IN.

448
00:18:16,893 --> 00:18:18,428
HAROLD'S WRAPPED
AROUND THE CORD.

449
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:21,131
AWAY THEY--
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND

450
00:18:21,197 --> 00:18:24,100
HOW THIS WAS HELPING US.

451
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:27,203
THEN I'M THINKING MAYBE
THEY'VE CHANGED THEIR MIND.

452
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,205
THEY'RE GONNA BUILD
A THEME PARK

453
00:18:29,272 --> 00:18:30,874
AND THIS IS THE MAIN RIDE.

454
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,677
I SAY, "HEY, BOYS,
RIDE'S OVER."

455
00:18:33,743 --> 00:18:37,614
I BET YOU 10 BUCKS
HAROLD WANTS TO GO AGAIN.

456
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:39,816
I'LL BE UP TO MY ELBOWS

457
00:18:39,883 --> 00:18:41,518
IN YOU-KNOW-WHAT.

458
00:18:46,856 --> 00:18:48,425
(Red): WE GOT THE FORM DONE.

459
00:18:48,491 --> 00:18:50,427
WAITING FOR BILL TO COME BACK.

460
00:18:50,493 --> 00:18:52,262
WOW! WELL, I'M IMPRESSED.

461
00:18:52,328 --> 00:18:56,566
THAT CREDIT CARD IS WORKING
AT THE RENTAL STORE, OBVIOUSLY.

462
00:18:56,633 --> 00:19:00,003
WE GOT THE SHOVELS
AND CEMENT'S GONNA COME DOWN.

463
00:19:00,069 --> 00:19:01,504
OH, I SEE -- OK, OK.

464
00:19:01,571 --> 00:19:03,640
WE'RE GONNA GET IT
WITH THE SHOVELS.

465
00:19:03,706 --> 00:19:06,843
I'M NOT SURE BILL'S AWARE
OF HOW THE EQUIPMENT WORKS.

466
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,344
THERE WE GO, THERE WE GO.

467
00:19:08,411 --> 00:19:10,280
SOMETHING'S STARTING TO HAPPEN.

468
00:19:10,346 --> 00:19:13,082
WE'RE GONNA CARRY IT BY SHOVEL.

469
00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:14,417
I THOUGHT A WHEELBARROW...

470
00:19:14,484 --> 00:19:15,785
WELL, THAT'S JUST ME.

471
00:19:15,852 --> 00:19:17,453
THAT'S FINE, THAT'S FINE.

472
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,888
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

473
00:19:18,955 --> 00:19:21,291
IT'S AMAZING
HOW HEAVY THAT STUFF IS.

474
00:19:21,357 --> 00:19:25,094
THERE'S A LOT OF WATER IN THAT,
AND STONE AND SAND AND...

475
00:19:25,161 --> 00:19:27,096
OH, BOY, YOU MAY WANT
TO SLOW THAT...

476
00:19:27,163 --> 00:19:28,431
JUST BACK THAT OFF.

477
00:19:28,498 --> 00:19:29,766
OK, THAT'S FINE.

478
00:19:29,832 --> 00:19:31,100
ALL RIGHT, WE GOT IT.

479
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:32,435
WE'LL GET THAT OFF.

480
00:19:32,502 --> 00:19:34,604
WE'RE FINE -- GET THAT, HAROLD.

481
00:19:34,671 --> 00:19:38,107
MAYBE A BIGGER SHOVEL
MIGHT HAVE BEEN A PLAN.

482
00:19:38,174 --> 00:19:39,976
OH, BOY, CAN YOU NOT--

483
00:19:40,043 --> 00:19:41,611
IS THERE A DIMMER?

484
00:19:41,678 --> 00:19:43,580
THERE'S A DIMMER RIGHT THERE.

485
00:19:43,646 --> 00:19:45,114
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE FINE.

486
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:46,883
THERE WE GO -- BIGGER SHOVEL.

487
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,351
BIGGER SHOVEL -- THERE WE GO.

488
00:19:48,418 --> 00:19:49,953
BOY, THAT IS HEAVY.

489
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:53,289
AND THEN WE GOT THE IDEA,
KIND OF A BUCKET BRIGADE THING.

490
00:19:53,356 --> 00:19:55,191
IT'S SEEN IN SOME
OF THE EARLIER

491
00:19:55,258 --> 00:19:57,126
"SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON"
SPECIALS.

492
00:19:57,193 --> 00:19:59,829
OH, BOY, HAROLD,
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE--

493
00:19:59,896 --> 00:20:01,331
I DON'T THINK HAROLD

494
00:20:01,397 --> 00:20:04,300
TOTALLY UNDERSTANDS THE POINT
OF CO-OPERATION.

495
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:06,002
THAT'S OBVIOUS EVERY EPISODE.

496
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:07,337
WHAT'S BILL DOING?

497
00:20:07,403 --> 00:20:08,671
SORRY, BILL.

498
00:20:08,738 --> 00:20:10,206
WE HADN'T NOTICED THAT.

499
00:20:10,273 --> 00:20:11,808
WE WERE KIND OF TIED UP.

500
00:20:11,874 --> 00:20:14,277
WE WERE DUMPING THE CEMENT
RIGHT ON...

501
00:20:14,344 --> 00:20:15,812
APPARENTLY RIGHT ON BILL.

502
00:20:15,878 --> 00:20:17,213
YOU CAN ONLY WATCH

503
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,749
SO MANY "I LOVE LUCY"'s,
IT STARTS TO RUB OFF.

504
00:20:19,816 --> 00:20:21,150
GOT OUR TABLE DONE.

505
00:20:21,217 --> 00:20:24,087
WE HEARD SOMETHING
COMING FROM-- WE REALIZED...

506
00:20:24,153 --> 00:20:25,588
OH, BY GOLLY!

507
00:20:25,655 --> 00:20:27,090
BILL'S STUCK INSIDE--

508
00:20:27,156 --> 00:20:28,925
WE HAVE CEMENTED BILL IN--

509
00:20:28,991 --> 00:20:30,426
WE CEMENTED-- OH, BOY!

510
00:20:30,493 --> 00:20:32,862
OH, GOOD, THAT WAS GOOD.

511
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:34,497
YEAH, HE'S FINE.

512
00:20:34,564 --> 00:20:35,832
THAT'S GREAT.

513
00:20:35,898 --> 00:20:37,266
WELL, THERE WE GO.

514
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,669
BILL AS A TABLE -- I LIKE IT.

515
00:20:42,672 --> 00:20:44,841
HOWDY, THIS IS RANGER GORD,
REMINDING YOU

516
00:20:44,907 --> 00:20:46,676
WHERE THERE'S SMOKE,
THERE'S FIRE,

517
00:20:46,743 --> 00:20:49,112
AND WHERE THERE'S FIRE,
THERE'S RANGER GORD,

518
00:20:49,178 --> 00:20:52,181
AND WHERE THERE'S RANGER GORD,
THERE'S...

519
00:20:54,851 --> 00:20:57,120
... NOTHING.

520
00:20:57,186 --> 00:20:59,622
THERE'S NOBODY.

521
00:20:59,689 --> 00:21:01,124
NOTHING!

522
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,625
NOTHING!

523
00:21:02,692 --> 00:21:03,960
OH, NO!

524
00:21:04,026 --> 00:21:05,228
(Can falling over)

525
00:21:05,294 --> 00:21:06,696
OH, MY TOILET!

526
00:21:06,762 --> 00:21:10,967
WELL, WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
YOU'D HAVE FUN WITH CONCRETE?

527
00:21:11,033 --> 00:21:13,002
CONCRETE BEACH,

528
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:15,571
CONCRETE HEDGE,
CONCRETE PETS...

529
00:21:15,638 --> 00:21:17,206
(Audience laughing)

530
00:21:17,273 --> 00:21:19,408
HAVE YOU FINISHED
THAT WOODEN FORM

531
00:21:19,475 --> 00:21:21,043
TO POUR YOUR CHESSBOARD?

532
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,546
FINISHED HAMMERING
THE LAST NAIL

533
00:21:23,613 --> 00:21:25,248
NOT FIVE MINUTES AGO.

534
00:21:25,314 --> 00:21:28,084
ALL I GOTTA DO
IS POUR THE CONCRETE.

535
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,819
WE SAVED YOU
THE LAST TRUCKLOAD.

536
00:21:29,886 --> 00:21:31,254
ONE TRUCKLOAD'S LEFT?

537
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,824
I NEED SIX FOR THE CHESSBOARD
AND THREE FOR THE PLAYERS.

538
00:21:34,891 --> 00:21:36,626
I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO ORDER

539
00:21:36,692 --> 00:21:38,895
ANOTHER 15 TRUCKLOADS
FOR TOMORROW.

540
00:21:38,961 --> 00:21:41,864
I GOT DIBS ON THE FIRST FIVE.

541
00:21:41,931 --> 00:21:45,034
HOW DID THAT CONCRETE
SKATEBOARD RAMP TURN OUT?

542
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:46,369
NOT GOOD, NO.

543
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:48,971
IT'S HARD TO GET CEMENT
TO FLOW UPHILL.

544
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:51,240
YEAH, YEAH.

545
00:21:51,307 --> 00:21:53,109
OH...

546
00:21:53,175 --> 00:21:57,613
(Grunting)

547
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,615
AHHH...

548
00:21:59,682 --> 00:22:03,452
WHAT I LEARNED IS I SHOULD POUR
FROM THE TOP NEXT TIME.

549
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:04,720
YEAH.

550
00:22:04,787 --> 00:22:06,555
(Possum squeal)

551
00:22:06,622 --> 00:22:08,057
IT'S MEETING TIME.

552
00:22:08,124 --> 00:22:09,558
WELL, YOU GO,
HAROLD.

553
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,560
I'LL BE DOWN
IN 20 MINUTES.

554
00:22:11,627 --> 00:22:14,563
I OUGHT TO BE THERE ABOUT THEN.

555
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,065
WOW.

556
00:22:16,132 --> 00:22:17,566
I'M ON MY WAY.

557
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:19,068
ALL RIGHT,
THEN, GO.

558
00:22:19,135 --> 00:22:20,569
AWAY YOU GO.

559
00:22:20,636 --> 00:22:22,071
OFF YOU GO,
THEN.

560
00:22:22,138 --> 00:22:24,573
BANG!
OFF YOU GO.

561
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,075
OFF YOU GO.

562
00:22:26,142 --> 00:22:28,077
BEN JOHNSON
ON A SENIORS' TOUR.

563
00:22:28,144 --> 00:22:32,548
(Laughing and applause)

564
00:22:32,615 --> 00:22:34,083
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

565
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,886
I'M COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

566
00:22:36,952 --> 00:22:39,822
I'M GONNA BE BRINGING
TWO GAS CANS OF CEMENT.

567
00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:41,891
GONNA HAVE MATCHING HEADSTONES.

568
00:22:41,957 --> 00:22:44,160
I'LL BE NO-LEAD,
YOU'LL BE PREMIUM.

569
00:22:44,226 --> 00:22:46,095
THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

570
00:22:46,162 --> 00:22:48,097
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND...

571
00:22:48,164 --> 00:22:49,598
(Possum squeal)

572
00:22:49,665 --> 00:22:51,100
... FLASH...

573
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:55,604
UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN,
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

574
00:22:55,671 --> 00:22:58,174
(Applause)

575
00:23:01,911 --> 00:23:09,051
(Possum squeal)

576
00:23:09,118 --> 00:23:12,388
(Harold): OK, ALL RISE.

577
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:18,160
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS, MORITATI
