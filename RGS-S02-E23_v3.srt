1
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:44,544
And now it's time for the show that answers
the questions who, what, where, when and why,

2
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:50,650
what you ask and I'll say the red green show
where you ask, Well, right here, where else

3
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,684
and why?

4
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,186
Because we like you.

5
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:56,489
And of course, you know, we need the money
and the time slot was available.

6
00:00:56,523 --> 00:01:00,994
And who, while only the greatest human being
who ever walked through that door at the back

7
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:04,397
of the lodge there, you know, sort of to a
left by the by the snowshoe right there.

8
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,233
Here he is, the star of my show and my
uncle, Mr.

9
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,835
Red Green.

10
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:13,039
It's about how, Howard, what the hell?

11
00:01:13,806 --> 00:01:15,909
Thank you. Welcome to possum, Elijah.

12
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,577
It's a pleasure for me to be here.

13
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,646
That doesn't mean I wouldn't be happier
someplace else.

14
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:24,751
And speaking of someplace else, you've
already met my nephew on a more personal

15
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,953
note, my producer and director Harold.

16
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:29,756
Hello. I'm the guy who makes the buttons in
the show.

17
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:30,423
Go do this.

18
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:34,560
Oh, sure, blame it on the buttons.

19
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:38,665
Now the guys are pretty edgy up at the lodge
this week, I don't I don't know what it is,

20
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:39,899
but I tell you I don't like it.

21
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:42,402
You think maybe it's just everybody starting
to get on each other's nerves.

22
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,871
Sometimes people do that when they get on
each other's nerves, it starts to bug other

23
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,005
people. I think that would. It could be.

24
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,073
What do you think, Uncle Red?

25
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:48,274
Well, Harold, when

26
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,410
That happens, you can't even control where
you live or stuff.

27
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,445
He just starts to bug you and you don't even
know why.

28
00:01:53,312 --> 00:01:54,313
Yeah, I imagine it's a

29
00:01:54,313 --> 00:01:55,581
Great idea, right? That's the big thing.

30
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:59,085
It's it's great. It's great to know why
people keep doing the same thing again and

31
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:03,189
again and again and again and again and
again and again and again and again and again

32
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:05,391
and again and again and again and again.

33
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,060
And then what? They do it again.

34
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,328
Oh, well, that's a theory.

35
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:11,864
May have to kill him someday.

36
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,001
Anyway, I think what the guys need is a
vacation.

37
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:19,172
I mean, I know they come up here to get away
from it all, but sometimes they start

38
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:19,972
bringing it with them.

39
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:23,176
You know, like this morning. I asked, Well,
man, Sedgwick to pass me the salt, right?

40
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,445
So I said, OK, no, I'm sorry.

41
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:28,748
I didn't mean that. I didn't mean I had a
cup of coffee about a week ago.

42
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:30,983
Kind of jangle my nerves and I feel bad.

43
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:32,385
No, I didn't mean it. Go ahead.

44
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:33,986
Go on. Go on, go on. This morning I asked

45
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:35,321
Asshole man Sedgwick, pass me the salt,
right?

46
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:37,156
He says, Oh, well, what's in it for me?

47
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,425
Well, I meant at that time.

48
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,272
And you see this month's edition of Humongous
Fish.

49
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:55,608
No, no, I haven't seen that dog.

50
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,677
Well, I'm not going to get real column.

51
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:01,080
They say the Marlin are biting off the
Florida coast Gulf side.

52
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,249
Oh, that's good fishing buoys.

53
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,585
I'll tell you, I was there about 10 years
back.

54
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,521
Did you catch anything he just did?

55
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:15,027
Well, as a matter of fact, on my last day
there, my son was just dipping down below the

56
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:19,265
horizon. I was just coming back up from the
bathroom after throwing up my Dramamine.

57
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:24,203
As soon as I sat down in that chair bang,
something hit my bait and that line went up

58
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,205
from between my legs so fast you couldn't
see it.

59
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:30,576
You could hear that real squealing, Hey,
that much those ball bearings heating up.

60
00:03:31,043 --> 00:03:33,612
She was one hundred and seventy two thousand
degrees kelvin.

61
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,749
Luckily, fear helped me cool it down.

62
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,385
That's what happens when you hear a line
cutting the prop.

63
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,488
Talk to one of my ladies in the blanket.

64
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:46,125
No. So OK, so yourselves.

65
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,963
He actually was the biggest Marlin you ever
saw.

66
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:56,469
But four men and a small boy that landed 17
tons of fish.

67
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,939
Oh, that muscle. And how would you clean
something like that now?

68
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:04,110
Hmm. Well, he tossed it on a boat trailer
and told it to the nearest car wash and went

69
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,080
at it with a buck sock. The manager refused
to honor our gas coupons.

70
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,648
That's a nice tumblers, though.

71
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:13,953
Anyway, I'm thinking about mounting another
expedition to the Sunshine State.

72
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:16,856
No way. Oh, Disney World.

73
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:18,891
Oh, come on, we can't afford to go.

74
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:22,261
The airfares are too much. And besides, you
guys should all want to bring your fish back

75
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:23,329
as carry on.

76
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:26,398
Oh, now we happen to know somebody who owns
an RV.

77
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:29,935
No, but the RV, you want to take the RV to
Florida?

78
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:33,906
Yeah, I was thinking how nice that RV would
look parked on a Florida beach?

79
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:35,341
Oh, sure. Can you just see it?

80
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,809
I could just I could see it, huh?

81
00:04:37,309 --> 00:04:38,444
And the bumper sticker?

82
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:41,914
Oh yeah. I visited Disney World Busch
Gardens.

83
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:47,086
We saw SeaWorld, the one man.

84
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:48,787
I could just see it, you know, I could just
see it.

85
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,557
So the the RV is going to Florida.

86
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:56,662
Absolutely. Oh, it's so totally awesome.

87
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,064
Oh, Busch Gardens, Disney World.

88
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:04,303
The girls on the beaches, you know, with
their teeny weeny microscopic bikinis.

89
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:05,437
You know, I got my

90
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:08,240
Binoculars, you know, my suntan lotion and
all real

91
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,142
High number two, you know, because you can
use those.

92
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:15,814
And of course, you know, fishing for Marvin,
for Marlin, Marlin, you know, whoever is

93
00:05:15,814 --> 00:05:16,215
around.

94
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:20,486
Well, I'm up for it. I'm in you, Eddie.

95
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:23,355
You hate fishing? Well, I'm going.

96
00:05:23,622 --> 00:05:24,657
All right, Bill.

97
00:05:25,557 --> 00:05:27,226
Ok, that's all right.

98
00:05:28,093 --> 00:05:30,529
I'll go up to the RV. I got I got all the
new maps.

99
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:32,331
I just got them from the RV Gypsy Road club.

100
00:05:32,464 --> 00:05:35,768
Oh yeah, they got all all these little
symbols where they marked out, where you can

101
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,237
get like fat parking spots and you get cheap
gas, huh?

102
00:05:38,837 --> 00:05:41,273
We can just jump on that I-75 right through
Tennessee.

103
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:46,545
Oh, what? You know, I'd be up for it too.

104
00:05:46,578 --> 00:05:50,883
You know, anybody asks me or not red.

105
00:05:51,383 --> 00:05:52,084
How about one?

106
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:55,554
No. Thanks, Eddie. Not if here is going to be
out of town.

107
00:05:56,488 --> 00:06:00,259
But I think your boy should realize, you
know, Ben likes going places and he likes

108
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,928
coming back, but he really doesn't like
being there.

109
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:04,963
Well, that's because nobody likes

110
00:06:04,963 --> 00:06:09,168
Him being there. Well, how are we going to
get to Florida if we don't take Glenn's RV?

111
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:10,903
I mean, you know, I mean, how are you guys

112
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,871
Going to get to Florida without his RV?

113
00:06:13,238 --> 00:06:15,741
Is what, man? Well, we have Glenn's RV.

114
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:17,743
I never said anything about Glenn.

115
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,145
Oh boy. Well, what do you hold?

116
00:06:20,145 --> 00:06:22,881
He hold it right there. And oh, that's
that's subversive.

117
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:23,882
That's manipulative.

118
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,284
No way. Count me out.

119
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:26,752
That is wrong. No.

120
00:06:27,753 --> 00:06:31,690
Of course, if you chip in for gas, Harold, we
could see our way clear to dropping you off

121
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,791
at Disney World.

122
00:06:33,325 --> 00:06:34,193
Ok, I'm in.

123
00:06:35,627 --> 00:06:38,197
Oh boy, I got a real bad feeling about this.

124
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:41,667
Even though it would do Harold Hero a world
of good to meet the real goofy.

125
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:43,669
It'll be a piece of cake.

126
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:45,504
Not your cake, of course.

127
00:06:46,104 --> 00:06:49,741
Yay. See Gleno.

128
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:52,578
You're feeling all right. Look a little in
there.

129
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:54,746
You're not coming down with anything, are
you?

130
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:57,149
No, I don't think I can watch this.

131
00:06:57,616 --> 00:07:00,285
See you guys later. Hey, this will be great,
Glenn.

132
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:02,220
The good for the R&B too.

133
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,490
To get on this long run like this under your
belt, you're doing a world of good.

134
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:06,625
Oh, great.

135
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:07,893
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

136
00:07:07,993 --> 00:07:12,297
I can see the RV now parked underneath those
swaying palm trees, huh?

137
00:07:13,498 --> 00:07:15,434
Yes, their lawn chairs out front.

138
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:19,004
I'm in the hammock and he's at the barbecue.

139
00:07:19,404 --> 00:07:20,939
I can't see the barbecue, of course.

140
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:27,579
Harold's out front row and his frisbee
herald of the kid's got his heart set on

141
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:29,348
shaking Pluto's paw, you know.

142
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:31,349
Oh, okay, sure.

143
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:32,818
I can't ask you not to go.

144
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:33,919
It's a trip of a lifetime.

145
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:35,187
Oh yeah, yeah.

146
00:07:35,687 --> 00:07:39,424
The Sun's beaming down and Bill's gathering
up coconuts.

147
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:41,293
And what am I doing, Doug?

148
00:07:41,827 --> 00:07:44,663
Run on your marina. I kid you.

149
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:46,698
I can't run my marina from Florida.

150
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:50,569
Well, we'll send you a postcard, then duck.

151
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:54,106
It's my RV. See the thing I go where the RV
goes?

152
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,777
Well, now, Glenn, there's not room enough
for all.

153
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:01,179
Well, then, honey, you can't go.

154
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,182
Well, that's not the way it works, Glenn,
though.

155
00:08:04,282 --> 00:08:07,352
You see, with all the stuff, it's it's all
of us or none of us.

156
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:10,755
Oh, well, grab a chair then, because
nobody's going in, huh?

157
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:20,131
I went away a humbug, no.

158
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:24,502
That's the song you sing with a hornet in
your shorts.

159
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:34,079
This week on

160
00:08:34,446 --> 00:08:38,850
Handymen Corner, we're going to show you what
you can do with all that crap your wife makes

161
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,951
you bring in every winter.

162
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:41,820
You know, first of all, there's the picnic
table.

163
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,456
She doesn't want that in the backyard
because she wants to get it out of the

164
00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:50,362
weather. And also, it stops the snowmobilers
from running into the clothesline and letting

165
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:51,863
you have the lawn edging.

166
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:54,299
I just want you to bring that in.

167
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:56,067
You know, it goes between the garden and the
lawn.

168
00:08:56,534 --> 00:08:59,804
She doesn't want you to run over that with a
snow blower again.

169
00:09:00,972 --> 00:09:03,742
And now this, I can understand the croquet
said, OK, fine.

170
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:07,846
You don't want to be playing croquet when
the balls are all frozen and spit like cooked

171
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:13,752
peas. On the other hand, the indoor outdoor
carpeting is a bit of a stretch because to

172
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:19,391
me, the word outdoor is right in the name,
you know, along with odor.

173
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:21,960
I guess it's part of outdoor and shouldn't
this be outdoors?

174
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,728
But apparently not.

175
00:09:24,462 --> 00:09:30,101
And finally, my work socks, which have been
added on the line since around Lent.

176
00:09:31,302 --> 00:09:36,608
But you know, rather than accept us as a as
a storage problem, the true handyman accepts

177
00:09:36,608 --> 00:09:41,579
this as a challenge, and I happen to be
packing my staple gun when I'm packing my

178
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:43,948
staple gun. I'm ready for any challenge.

179
00:09:46,317 --> 00:09:47,552
Oh, sorry, Harold.

180
00:09:50,822 --> 00:09:59,464
All right. Step one is to wet everything off
the table except for the the carpeting, and

181
00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:03,168
we're going to attach the carpeting and then
we're going to attach the lawn edging to the

182
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:06,504
table using the staple gun, just like re
upholstery in a chair.

183
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:22,320
Come see, come saw, and all we do is put the
croquet hoops in where the gaps are and then

184
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:28,426
cover them over with the work socks using
the handyman secret weapon duct tape.

185
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:34,332
So there you have it. Let the winner stay as
long as it wants.

186
00:10:34,332 --> 00:10:36,801
I'll be inside here playing croquet pool.

187
00:10:37,635 --> 00:10:40,838
And you know, if you wanted to build some
sort of a ball return system here, you could

188
00:10:40,838 --> 00:10:44,642
use the downspouts from your eavesdropping
or even your toilet drainpipes.

189
00:10:46,844 --> 00:10:49,380
Ok. Yellow ball in the side pocket.

190
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:55,019
Oh, remember, if the women don't find you
handsome, they should at least find it handy.

191
00:11:01,426 --> 00:11:02,160
Nice break.

192
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:21,012
It is winter, the snow is plowed and piled
deep at the side of the road here and there,

193
00:11:21,045 --> 00:11:25,983
sticking out of the giant mounds, the hands
or feet of snow pedestrians.

194
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,721
Brett O'Gara, what do you do when you left
school?

195
00:11:32,924 --> 00:11:38,029
Well, Harold, usually I'd go home and empty
the pigsty, you know, except Thursdays,

196
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:39,564
Thursdays, I hose down the horses.

197
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:41,065
I hated Thursdays.

198
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:45,636
No, no. I mean, like after you graduated
school, would you do then?

199
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:49,807
Well, after grade seven, I went right into
the army.

200
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:53,144
They take them. They take you into the army
grade seven.

201
00:11:54,145 --> 00:11:58,482
Well, they do that. If you're 19 years old
now, why don't you join the army here in a

202
00:11:58,482 --> 00:11:59,150
career, huh?

203
00:11:59,817 --> 00:12:02,153
No, no, I don't think so.

204
00:12:02,153 --> 00:12:05,223
I don't think marching in step is a big plus
on anybody's resume anymore.

205
00:12:05,256 --> 00:12:07,458
I'll go and join the army.

206
00:12:07,491 --> 00:12:09,360
No, wait. You got to get up early.

207
00:12:09,393 --> 00:12:15,233
Go marching around, wear uniforms, live in
Spartan quarters, eat lousy food, carry guns.

208
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:16,601
Get killed, be killed.

209
00:12:16,634 --> 00:12:17,702
Oh no, no.

210
00:12:18,035 --> 00:12:19,170
All for minimum wage.

211
00:12:19,971 --> 00:12:21,038
I can do that here.

212
00:12:21,806 --> 00:12:22,873
I just don't like it.

213
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:32,316
I'll tell you, this Florida trip has been on
and off again more times than old man

214
00:12:32,316 --> 00:12:33,351
Sedgwick's toupee.

215
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:35,853
Now, Glenn says he's going to make it a solo
run.

216
00:12:36,687 --> 00:12:40,257
Thirty two hours of thunder straight down
there, 40 hours, actually, if he sticks to

217
00:12:40,257 --> 00:12:45,229
the speed limit. But the guys are holding
fast with that all for one and one size fits

218
00:12:45,229 --> 00:12:47,631
all thing, at least publicly.

219
00:12:48,032 --> 00:12:52,770
I have a feeling a few of them are trying to
cut side deals, you know, on the side deals.

220
00:12:53,771 --> 00:12:55,239
It's funny. Isn't that a guy?

221
00:12:55,272 --> 00:12:57,174
Nobody likes? Glenn sure gained a lot of
popularity.

222
00:12:58,309 --> 00:12:58,576
But, you

223
00:12:58,576 --> 00:13:00,277
Know, read, he's got the power.

224
00:13:00,277 --> 00:13:02,046
You know what they say? Power and personal
popularity.

225
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,748
They go hand in hand.

226
00:13:04,548 --> 00:13:07,785
Well, yeah. Well, how come nobody can stand
the guy who produces and directs this show?

227
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:12,523
Well, they're jealous, aren't they?

228
00:13:13,924 --> 00:13:18,028
Oh, that must be it. Well, anyway, everybody
is kind of looking forward to going down in

229
00:13:18,028 --> 00:13:19,063
Florida. Even Harold here.

230
00:13:19,063 --> 00:13:21,932
I think he's dying to go down to Disney
World and ride on one of them big, huge

231
00:13:21,932 --> 00:13:22,500
teacups.

232
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,135
That'd be so neat.

233
00:13:24,535 --> 00:13:26,203
Oh, do you think it's like you sit in a big
teabag?

234
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,441
Like I say, everybody's got their own reasons
for going.

235
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:32,143
Except Eddie, I don't know why he's gone.

236
00:13:32,143 --> 00:13:34,645
And of course, myself, there's nothing for
me there.

237
00:13:34,678 --> 00:13:36,480
Oh yes, there is. What about the fountain of
youth?

238
00:13:37,148 --> 00:13:38,749
You know, you remind me of Ponce de Leon.

239
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:40,518
You got the beard and you can ever find
anything.

240
00:13:41,218 --> 00:13:42,486
Just take us into the next segment, Harold.

241
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,256
Oh, I struck a nerve.

242
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,924
No, but I'm going to.

243
00:13:47,491 --> 00:13:48,058
Oh, OK.

244
00:13:54,798 --> 00:13:56,534
Oh, OK.

245
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,636
Oh, right. Bed look, I'm glad you're here.

246
00:13:58,669 --> 00:14:00,504
I need your advice. Yeah, you do.

247
00:14:01,505 --> 00:14:05,910
Do you know what's in Florida swamp Disney
World?

248
00:14:06,343 --> 00:14:07,511
Do you know what's in Disney World?

249
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:12,783
Mgm Studios and now they've got backstage
studio tours when I see Mr.

250
00:14:12,783 --> 00:14:14,818
Spielberg. I'm going to leap from the bus.

251
00:14:14,952 --> 00:14:20,357
I'm going to jump up on that stage and I'm
going to sing and dance my way into his

252
00:14:20,357 --> 00:14:23,260
heart. I'm going to get noticed red.

253
00:14:24,128 --> 00:14:25,562
Wow by the security guards.

254
00:14:25,562 --> 00:14:28,565
At the very least, you've got something in
the oven there, ready.

255
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:32,069
Everything is under control.

256
00:14:35,873 --> 00:14:38,442
Tucker, what do you think I should do?

257
00:14:38,475 --> 00:14:40,311
Should I? Should I sing and play clarinet?

258
00:14:40,544 --> 00:14:44,248
Tap dance with a mannequin, juggle
telephones and tell jokes.

259
00:14:45,182 --> 00:14:46,517
What's really popular

260
00:14:47,117 --> 00:14:47,618
Talent?

261
00:14:49,053 --> 00:14:51,221
I'm going to knock their socks off red.

262
00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:53,724
I got what they need.

263
00:14:54,591 --> 00:14:59,630
Well, unless they need a cook, Eddie, have
you got raw, unpeeled potato sitting right on

264
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,297
the heat there?

265
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:02,699
It doesn't matter.

266
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:04,168
This is my career.

267
00:15:04,968 --> 00:15:06,737
Yeah, you're right. Those are large potatoes.

268
00:15:07,171 --> 00:15:08,205
This is my moment red.

269
00:15:08,739 --> 00:15:11,175
And I'm going to seize my moment.

270
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,509
Shabu, shabu.

271
00:15:18,215 --> 00:15:19,316
Everyone's a critic.

272
00:15:21,852 --> 00:15:28,559
I've got a real book when I want to say
those, I've got a real special adventure with

273
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:31,361
Bill today, he's going up to all our friends
down in Australia.

274
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:38,569
First of all, the stables for sale and what
we wanted to do today was Bill had an idea to

275
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:40,070
do something on boomerangs.

276
00:15:40,137 --> 00:15:45,776
He'd bought this boomerang down at a max max
max boomerangs.

277
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:46,810
I think it's called anyway.

278
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,245
Oh gosh, there goes the wrapper.

279
00:15:48,412 --> 00:15:49,646
Look at that. Look at that.

280
00:15:49,813 --> 00:15:50,881
Holy mackerel.

281
00:15:52,082 --> 00:15:53,951
Well, I guess they've been left out.

282
00:15:55,052 --> 00:15:56,620
Got it. Nice catch.

283
00:15:57,854 --> 00:16:00,591
I don't know how that worked, but by golly,
Bill's got the touch.

284
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:02,859
So he gets a boomerang.

285
00:16:02,893 --> 00:16:09,566
The ideas, you know that you're trying to
use this as a well, maybe didn't quite get

286
00:16:09,566 --> 00:16:12,035
the grip just just right on that and give it
another go.

287
00:16:12,035 --> 00:16:13,303
Give another call. All right, I'll try
Harrisville.

288
00:16:13,637 --> 00:16:15,072
I'll try. I've never done this before.

289
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:16,173
I think I did the other way.

290
00:16:16,173 --> 00:16:22,145
But by golly, I can't believe this kervin
ran around by the barn and coming up, Oh,

291
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:24,915
nice, 'cause I'm kind of proud of myself
there.

292
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:30,687
So now Bill says, OK, before you go hunting
or whatever with a boomerang, you got to sort

293
00:16:30,687 --> 00:16:31,788
of do a little target practice.

294
00:16:31,788 --> 00:16:35,359
So luckily, I had these empty bottles in the
back of the van.

295
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:36,860
Purely coincidental, I'm sure.

296
00:16:38,462 --> 00:16:40,497
Oh, I'll take a little bit longer to

297
00:16:40,764 --> 00:16:44,501
Set those up than what we'd planned, but we
got nothing but time here on the red green.

298
00:16:44,501 --> 00:16:48,138
Joe and I give her a try and not bad.

299
00:16:48,138 --> 00:16:50,741
Not bad. I'm bad, Bill.

300
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:52,743
Give her a shot. Let's see how this goes.

301
00:16:54,177 --> 00:16:56,012
Oh, I'll I'll.

302
00:16:59,483 --> 00:17:02,586
Yeah. Wow.

303
00:17:03,386 --> 00:17:05,255
Oh, I told him to

304
00:17:05,255 --> 00:17:06,456
Have that bunion removed.

305
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,694
Get that out there. Oh, oh my gosh.

306
00:17:12,229 --> 00:17:13,764
Oh, that was going to affect the flight.

307
00:17:16,366 --> 00:17:17,767
Just outside.

308
00:17:19,202 --> 00:17:22,139
Oh, thank you, Bill.

309
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:24,641
All right, we're going to try her again on
this one.

310
00:17:24,674 --> 00:17:29,779
He fires them up, she goes, and you're
looking up into the sun there and you can't

311
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:31,615
see it values.

312
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:33,750
Forget about that one. Bill's got Bill's got
a couple more.

313
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,019
So here come on.

314
00:17:36,553 --> 00:17:40,290
Yeah. Oh, all right.

315
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,525
Let her go. Let her go.

316
00:17:43,326 --> 00:17:45,896
Oh oh my lucky hat.

317
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:50,333
Oh my gosh. Bill, what have you done to my
hat?

318
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:52,269
I don't care how it happened.

319
00:17:52,469 --> 00:17:58,041
You did it. All right, all right, settle
down, settle down, settle down, settle down.

320
00:17:58,775 --> 00:18:00,110
Look at that. Look.

321
00:18:01,311 --> 00:18:02,379
Oh, my gosh.

322
00:18:03,546 --> 00:18:09,853
This is for bringing down the big game like
elephants or or even I would say humans.

323
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:15,425
Well, she's out of control there to turn the
other way back.

324
00:18:15,925 --> 00:18:18,295
Get out. Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow.

325
00:18:20,163 --> 00:18:30,140
They shot their. Well,

326
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,742
by golly, this Florida trip has gotten real
complicated.

327
00:18:34,077 --> 00:18:37,547
Now Glenn is charging everybody five hundred
dollars to go to Florida in his RV.

328
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,948
I mean, that's more than the airfare.

329
00:18:39,449 --> 00:18:43,019
But then you can't have beer parties and
food fights on an airplane.

330
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,690
So it looks like everybody's going to go
except Glenn, which means no one's going to

331
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,758
go except Glenn.

332
00:18:49,426 --> 00:18:51,828
Apparently, that all gets explained at
tonight's Lodge meeting.

333
00:18:52,395 --> 00:18:54,431
I think it'd be simpler. Florida came here.

334
00:18:54,597 --> 00:18:56,199
Oh yeah, wouldn't that be great?

335
00:18:56,199 --> 00:18:57,834
We could sure use some fresh orange juice.

336
00:18:58,601 --> 00:19:01,371
Can you not just picture me lying in the
white sand?

337
00:19:01,938 --> 00:19:03,473
Yeah. You blend right in, Harold.

338
00:19:05,975 --> 00:19:07,110
The cry of the wild possum.

339
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,144
It's meeting time.

340
00:19:08,178 --> 00:19:11,414
Now we get to find out who gets to go to the
Sunshine State and who doesn't.

341
00:19:12,482 --> 00:19:15,819
Yeah, I'm beginning to understand why there
are so many old people in Florida.

342
00:19:16,052 --> 00:19:17,453
Takes your whole life to make the travel
arrangements.

343
00:19:18,755 --> 00:19:28,398
All right. Why are?

344
00:19:31,901 --> 00:19:34,437
All right.

345
00:19:42,345 --> 00:19:43,713
You know,

346
00:19:48,184 --> 00:19:50,219
Flora is writer Ingrid

347
00:19:50,987 --> 00:19:52,822
Matlin, gentlemen of both this Florida.

348
00:19:52,956 --> 00:19:55,291
Forget it. Oh no, no, no.

349
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,794
You see, Glenn, we all want to go with you
guys.

350
00:20:00,263 --> 00:20:04,500
But yeah, yeah, we feel really bad, Glenn,
we want you to go, we really do.

351
00:20:04,734 --> 00:20:07,971
It wouldn't be any fun without, you know,
what's the catch, what I'm supposed to fly

352
00:20:07,971 --> 00:20:10,373
down or something? No, no, no.

353
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,841
You see again.

354
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:22,418
Yeah, look OK.

355
00:20:22,418 --> 00:20:24,120
Yeah. All right. Here we go.

356
00:20:26,389 --> 00:20:29,325
The Nine Amigos are forward about, oh god.

357
00:20:29,726 --> 00:20:31,160
There's only room for eight on the RV.

358
00:20:31,194 --> 00:20:33,029
Yeah, that's what we're towing a boat.

359
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:34,630
I mean, someone can just ride in the back.

360
00:20:35,598 --> 00:20:40,169
Well, right in that boat, all the way to
Florida this summer.

361
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:44,640
It's like riding the convertible mountain.

362
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:47,376
Now we're going to draw to see who goes in
the book.

363
00:20:47,443 --> 00:20:51,347
All right. No, now we've all put our names,
these little pieces of paper here, Glenn.

364
00:20:51,414 --> 00:20:53,316
So paper pencil good.

365
00:20:53,483 --> 00:20:54,750
And just put your name out there.

366
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,885
Drop in the bucket.

367
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,889
And now we'll commence with our own lucky
draw.

368
00:21:02,525 --> 00:21:02,825
Oh.

369
00:21:06,462 --> 00:21:07,196
Watch out there.

370
00:21:07,463 --> 00:21:12,635
Thanks largely to the drawing, seeing how
you're uninvolved and unbiased

371
00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:15,838
And not interested, OK?

372
00:21:16,172 --> 00:21:20,910
You're a lucky loser, is Glenn Brock's.

373
00:21:26,415 --> 00:21:28,885
Huh. But I'm guessing oh, one and nine.

374
00:21:29,452 --> 00:21:33,022
Right? Well, I'll get to see the RV rolling
down the highway.

375
00:21:34,824 --> 00:21:36,792
Well, I better go pack a windbreaker.

376
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,996
We're even done. Yeah.

377
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:41,797
Yes. I don't know about the.

378
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:47,103
Oh, what a guy like that.

379
00:21:47,103 --> 00:21:49,071
No. You know, this is kind of interesting.

380
00:21:49,205 --> 00:21:52,041
Now look how much Glen Braxton's handwriting
looks like yours.

381
00:21:52,074 --> 00:21:55,011
Isn't that weird? Oh, you'd probably say, Oh,
Gypsy?

382
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:57,246
And he spelled his last name wrong.

383
00:21:57,246 --> 00:21:58,080
That's unusual, isn't it?

384
00:21:58,214 --> 00:21:59,649
Well, well, he was nervous. Read, you know.

385
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,885
Bill, Gwen Braxton, right, oh.

386
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:11,360
Most got it wrong. Braxton Glen Braxton
Braxton, you.

387
00:22:12,128 --> 00:22:13,629
You won't tell them, will you read

388
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,232
And give up two weeks of peace and quiet?

389
00:22:16,232 --> 00:22:19,168
Go to your mind now.

390
00:22:19,835 --> 00:22:22,238
All right. Our large business bill.

391
00:22:22,938 --> 00:22:24,840
Ok, I'm going to call on the Eddie.

392
00:22:25,007 --> 00:22:26,809
Eddie, go get some entertainment.

393
00:22:28,844 --> 00:22:34,450
Yes. Well, I'd like to do the the audition
piece that I plan to use at the MGM studio

394
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,952
when we arrive there at the Cotton Center
there, that special thing.

395
00:22:37,686 --> 00:22:44,326
It's a mind piece. It's a mind piece and
I've entitled it quite simply, man in the

396
00:22:44,326 --> 00:22:48,998
wind, in a box that's shrieking while doing
a tug of war.

397
00:22:49,598 --> 00:22:50,132
Smiling.

398
00:22:50,966 --> 00:22:55,571
Well, Gwen has to be about the saddest, most
desperate guy I've ever met around here.

399
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:59,708
That's going somewhere. I. Still, the votes
got a windshield, so we won't be too bad off.

400
00:23:00,142 --> 00:23:02,845
He can take off a couple of his coats after
they hit North Carolina.

401
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:04,880
Anyway, my wife is watching.

402
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,950
I'll be coming straight home after the
meeting and I thought maybe we could have our

403
00:23:07,983 --> 00:23:09,785
very own stay at home vacation.

404
00:23:10,152 --> 00:23:14,757
I'll bring a quart of orange juice and a sun
lamp, and maybe we could go to Adventureland

405
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:16,692
unless the roller coaster is closed.

406
00:23:18,027 --> 00:23:22,631
So until next time, on behalf of myself and
Harold and the whole gang up here in Possum

407
00:23:22,631 --> 00:23:24,500
Lodge. Keep your stick on the ice.

408
00:23:28,804 --> 00:23:31,840
It sounds like it's a book movie.

409
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,676
Watch your trust there it.

410
00:23:43,819 --> 00:23:46,488
I listen. How should we help?

411
00:23:49,158 --> 00:23:53,829
My employees in the blanket, oh, how easy
fellas come on.
