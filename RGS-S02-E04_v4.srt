1
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:45,178
Get ready for spine tingling adventure for
the greatest outdoorsman show since Larry of

2
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:50,283
the Jungle. I saw with with songs and films,
nudity and offensive language.

3
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,985
I show even young people will like.

4
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:55,955
And here he is, the star of our show and my
uncle through some bizarre

5
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:59,192
Case of mistaken identity, which happened to
lead to a hasty wedding.

6
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:00,393
But that's a long story.

7
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,462
Here he is, the most average man in the
world.

8
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:05,031
The round knob on the bell for real life.

9
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:07,133
The game show Mr.

10
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:08,001
Red Green.

11
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,005
Carol, thank you.

12
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:13,640
Welcome to Possum Lodge.

13
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:19,512
I'd like to apologize for Harold's intro,
the only nudity we have here are bald spots,

14
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,281
and there's nothing wrong with our language.

15
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:22,315
It's the people that use it that are
offensive.

16
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,653
I'm just trying to add some edge, you know,
some controversy like I do with my special

17
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:29,589
effects unit. No harm in that.

18
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,760
You know, young people like to make more of
things than they really are.

19
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:37,930
You know, it's something I guess they have
to do in order to help them find their way in

20
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,634
life and everything. I guess it's natural,
but bugs that crap out of me anyway.

21
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:48,041
Even in our annual report from our lodge
treasurer, Douglas and I thought it was a

22
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:51,277
pretty well received considering nobody had
read it and nobody listened.

23
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:02,922
What are you doing, Douglas, the large box?

24
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,058
Oh, you're busy.

25
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:07,160
Yes, I am.

26
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:08,761
I know that's hard

27
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,329
For a government employee to relate

28
00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:19,639
To. Was there something else?

29
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:22,108
Oh, yeah. Would you like to play a game of
golf?

30
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,644
Huh? For flak, huh?

31
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,813
Well, let's see.

32
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,316
I'm very busy wrapping up the large accounts
by the end of the month.

33
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:34,453
I have to pay the bills and write the checks.

34
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,389
And I hate golf.

35
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,025
So no, I guess not.

36
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,395
Oh, how about you, Harold?

37
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:43,729
I feel like 18.

38
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:49,235
I am 18. Come on, guys.

39
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:51,804
The Sun is shining.

40
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:52,872
It's nice weather.

41
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,509
Doesn't that just show dimpled balls and
mushy nipples?

42
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:02,315
Ok. How about a little game of golf?

43
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:06,552
A mini game. A game of mini golf?

44
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,022
Thank you very much. So enjoy yourself,
though.

45
00:03:11,223 --> 00:03:13,159
Well, I can't wait all day for you guys to
decide.

46
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:18,331
Oh yeah, by the way, mail came letters for
you.

47
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:22,168
Well, I'm off to see if anybody else is
interested in a foursome.

48
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,177
Boy, I thought he'd never leave those tramps
hanging in the hallway there.

49
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:36,082
Oh my God. Who were being audited?

50
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:38,651
The largest being audited?

51
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:41,620
Harold, the Blue Lodge is being audited.

52
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:45,524
Oh boy. Oh, what does that mean?

53
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,193
Are you going to get hurt at all?

54
00:03:47,626 --> 00:03:49,261
This is the end. This is it.

55
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,831
So who the government is against this?

56
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:54,800
You know how many people they have working
for them who are outnumbered?

57
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:57,970
Oh, we're done for. Well, I'm going to go
over.

58
00:03:58,337 --> 00:03:59,638
I'm going to count and find out.

59
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:00,873
We didn't pay enough tax.

60
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:03,709
Well, how much tax did we pay that this?

61
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:07,747
None. Oh, that doesn't sound like enough.

62
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,118
Well, now don't worry, fellas, I've been
through this kind of thing before.

63
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:14,620
All right, everybody, come on over here.

64
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,124
Bill Douglas Harold, grab a seat at the
table.

65
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,131
Ooh, what's this all about, Doug?

66
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:28,601
I don't like this. You scare me.

67
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,302
I don't get your knickers in or not.

68
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:35,608
Douglas, grab a seat now read I'm going to
need about a dozen ballpoint pens and a big

69
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:39,011
wad of paper and hot water lots and lots of
hot water.

70
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,213
No, that's something entirely different.

71
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,315
It could make some coffee.

72
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,850
Yeah. Get the hot water.

73
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,687
Read Well.

74
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:52,658
Oh yeah, I'll get right on that doc.

75
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:58,697
Take notes. Oh, Harold, remember that pair of
rubber boots you bought last year so you

76
00:04:58,697 --> 00:05:01,367
could help retrieve old man Sedgwick's teeth
from the swamp?

77
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,637
Oh, vaguely, that was a business expense.

78
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,006
All right. Now, now what are those puppies
set you back?

79
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,607
Fourteen, ninety nine.

80
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,175
My mother still complains about that.

81
00:05:10,242 --> 00:05:11,777
All right. Well rounded off an even hundred.

82
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:13,946
He doesn't have a receipt.

83
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,049
Well, he will suit his red gets back with
the pens and paper.

84
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:19,051
Now remember fellows, you got to print real
nice.

85
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:20,519
So they look official. All right.

86
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:22,354
That's it. Leap.

87
00:05:23,522 --> 00:05:24,590
No, no.

88
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,525
He's right. You're right.

89
00:05:26,558 --> 00:05:27,860
Douglas, he's right.

90
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:34,533
So does only the Lodge Treasurer go to jail
or can read be charged two for not keeping

91
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:36,135
track of your financial misdeeds.

92
00:05:43,575 --> 00:05:44,576
What about haircuts?

93
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,478
I got one for every lodge meeting.

94
00:05:46,578 --> 00:05:47,946
That's another five hundred right there.

95
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:50,949
Need the Herald zit cream?

96
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:53,051
How about no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

97
00:05:53,085 --> 00:05:55,954
I don't want to go to court and have to
testify that I have zits.

98
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:58,023
I don't want Judge Wapner knowing that, oh
yeah.

99
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,826
Bills, medical expenses, they're the stuff.

100
00:06:00,826 --> 00:06:02,895
Stuffy damages. So let's a couple hundred in
a week anyway.

101
00:06:03,328 --> 00:06:05,330
No repairs to the lodge.

102
00:06:05,597 --> 00:06:08,367
You know, renovations, upgrading, cleaning
expenses.

103
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:12,838
Maintenance costs can't push that one
through thinking about this place?

104
00:06:12,838 --> 00:06:16,575
Ah, yeah, I'm sure, but probably.

105
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,478
Movie rentals for the VCR.

106
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:22,548
That's why I push it up.

107
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:26,852
Oh, wait a minute, we don't have a VCR.

108
00:06:28,086 --> 00:06:37,896
There's a bit of a loophole. Yeah. Dig, dig,
dig,

109
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:44,937
boy, that's a nice ring shuttle, boys that
pick ax ring again four times.

110
00:06:45,203 --> 00:06:48,907
Oh, dig, dig, dig boys work hard to say
because

111
00:06:49,207 --> 00:06:52,511
We got to get the sceptics in and operational
before the men finish lunch.

112
00:06:56,448 --> 00:07:05,791
And you. This week in my corner, we're going
to do a little bit of concentrating on

113
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:09,261
safety. You've all heard the expression
safety first.

114
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:11,697
Actually, at the Lodge, it's more like
safety first.

115
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:15,500
But you know what's with the decay of moral
values in society?

116
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,536
The members all feel they now have something
to live for.

117
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:23,108
So there's a whole new focus there on the
idea of safety, and this gave me an idea.

118
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:27,779
You know, the new cars now have these have
these airbags that are in front of you there.

119
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:31,249
And now I'm not talking about like the
little bags they have in front of you on the

120
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:35,520
airplane. I was thinking, what if you had a
personal airbag, something you could wear on

121
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,392
your body at all times for any kind of a
front end collision or whatever somebody?

122
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:43,962
I went design one of those. And of course,
the first thing you're going to need is an

123
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:49,768
undershirt. An undershirt is usually just
holding your own stomach, but this time it's

124
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:51,169
going to be having something of value.

125
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,038
So you want a sealer off real good.

126
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:55,841
You go across the bottom with some staples.

127
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:59,277
You might want to make two or three rows of
staples on there.

128
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:05,250
And then once you've got the staples all in
place, you want to just cover that up with

129
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,452
the handyman secret weapon duct tape.

130
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:11,890
This is just a safety precaution, really to
cover up the staples because any of you

131
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:15,660
who've ever been to the outhouse with a
magazine know the damage the stables can do.

132
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:18,029
I'll finish that off later.

133
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:22,334
What I want to show you right now is the
most important part of the airbag, which is

134
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:27,639
the airbag. Nothing runs like a deer.

135
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:30,542
What do you like a lawn bag?

136
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:32,043
But this is going to save your life.

137
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:39,150
What you do is open up your shirt or open up
your blouse or well, that's to stick with the

138
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:45,724
shirt now and. Right, pack the bag in there,
just like packing a parachute or there was a

139
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:49,527
movie one time where I think they said, Are
you packing a parachute or are you just glad

140
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:54,032
to see me? Chuck Lane with this parachute.

141
00:08:57,102 --> 00:09:02,440
All right. What's that's in place, you need
something that's going to fill the bag up,

142
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,541
something to inflate the bag.

143
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,378
And when you think about safety, what do you
think of?

144
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:13,818
Fire extinguisher and fill that thing up in
two seconds flat.

145
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:16,021
Now make sure you get the CO2 kind.

146
00:09:16,454 --> 00:09:19,958
Otherwise, you'll be picking fire retardant
out of your shorts for the next twenty four

147
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:23,428
years and a natural and unobtrusive looking,
isn't it?

148
00:09:24,195 --> 00:09:27,832
And the beauty of it is like, just be
walking down the street and if anything,

149
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:29,067
should start coming towards me.

150
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:32,704
I have a full frontal nature, grabs a
speeding truck and what have you.

151
00:09:32,904 --> 00:09:33,938
I just reach

152
00:09:33,938 --> 00:09:36,040
Calmly up over my back quickly, but

153
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:42,580
Call me up over my back and pull a safety pin
and and just release my personal air bag.

154
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:57,328
It's that simple. I remember women don't
find it handsome, they should at least find

155
00:09:57,328 --> 00:10:01,266
it handy. I'm freezing and I

156
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:06,538
Bought my bag. Twist Oh, twist.

157
00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:09,707
Plenty of those big bags

158
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:18,049
Spot over there, but.

159
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:33,097
It is autumn Thanksgiving weekend.

160
00:10:33,498 --> 00:10:38,636
Friends and family gather around the TV
Friday night, a basketball game Saturday,

161
00:10:38,636 --> 00:10:43,074
three college football games, hockey at
night, so I'm ready for football games.

162
00:10:43,074 --> 00:10:47,679
Some stock car races in a basketball game
Monday, five football games, the Belgian

163
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,414
Grand Prix and two hockey games.

164
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:51,449
We really do have so much to give.

165
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:52,483
Thanks for this year.

166
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:06,397
So unfortunately, money problems tend to
ruin friendships or whatever it is we have

167
00:11:06,397 --> 00:11:10,168
going for us up here at the Lodge and things
are kind of deteriorated to the point that

168
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:14,972
people are starting to point fingers at each
other and asking questions like what color a

169
00:11:14,972 --> 00:11:16,908
shoe polish were you drinking when you
bought that?

170
00:11:17,642 --> 00:11:21,212
Well, you know, I'm glad there were some
questionable purchases of late.

171
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:25,516
You know, I'm talking like the the eight
slot car race track sets, you know, minus the

172
00:11:25,516 --> 00:11:29,187
transformer in cars, the lava lamps, the
wind power

173
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:31,189
Typewriter, all the backhoe.

174
00:11:31,656 --> 00:11:32,857
What's wrong with the back, Harold?

175
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:34,759
Nothing, absolutely nothing.

176
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,828
Because I forgot that you purchased that,
didn't you?

177
00:11:37,962 --> 00:11:39,197
It doesn't matter who bought it, Harold.

178
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:41,566
I mean, backhoe was either a smart purchase
or it wasn't.

179
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:42,333
I say it was.

180
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:43,568
Oh, yes, yes. Yes. Yes, yes.

181
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:46,971
Yes. Oh, it was. I'm just saying that, you
know, you could always rent one.

182
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:53,010
Yeah. Yeah. Rent one, but if you're renting
one, often enough, it's cheaper to buy a back

183
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:53,277
home.

184
00:11:53,678 --> 00:11:55,480
Exactly. Yes, yes it is.

185
00:11:55,513 --> 00:11:58,683
It's just the only difference is that the
rental one it runs.

186
00:11:59,884 --> 00:12:03,120
Yes. And the one that I bought will run to
hell as soon as those carburetor parts come

187
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,789
in. Now, don't forget that.

188
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:06,624
That's how I got such a great price on.

189
00:12:06,657 --> 00:12:08,392
Oh yes, indeed he do.

190
00:12:08,392 --> 00:12:09,827
You got an excellent price on it.

191
00:12:09,861 --> 00:12:14,599
You know, I'm just I'm just some skeptics,
some skeptics, they might ask themselves

192
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:17,668
like, Well, why did they buy a backhoe that
doesn't run yet?

193
00:12:17,668 --> 00:12:19,537
They continue to rent one that does
something.

194
00:12:21,105 --> 00:12:22,974
Well, Harold, you're just you're just not
going to understand this.

195
00:12:22,974 --> 00:12:24,408
Ok, that's that's that simple.

196
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:27,345
It's the difference between capital
expenditure in daily operating costs.

197
00:12:27,378 --> 00:12:29,180
You know, you're never going to figure this
out here.

198
00:12:29,313 --> 00:12:31,782
No, no, it's beyond me.

199
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:49,467
Hi, Bob. Oh, hi.

200
00:12:50,835 --> 00:12:51,335
How are you doing?

201
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:54,005
Well, I go. Go, figure.

202
00:12:54,238 --> 00:12:54,672
Sorry.

203
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:58,843
Not bad. I guess I'm doing a little bit of
ministry work.

204
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:00,177
Oh, don't worry about it.

205
00:13:00,845 --> 00:13:02,279
All right. It's not important.

206
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:02,980
What are you doing here?

207
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,048
It's the ministry work.

208
00:13:04,548 --> 00:13:06,617
Does land survey.

209
00:13:07,418 --> 00:13:08,753
You do that with the golf ball.

210
00:13:09,887 --> 00:13:13,290
Well, it's the fastest way to, you know,
check which way the green breaks.

211
00:13:13,557 --> 00:13:15,092
Oh yeah, the land breaks.

212
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,828
The land slopes.

213
00:13:18,229 --> 00:13:22,032
Oh, oh yeah.

214
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,073
Oh, yeah, definitely a problem.

215
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:32,977
Yeah, yeah, definitely some lateral movement
in the sub strata.

216
00:13:33,444 --> 00:13:34,912
Yeah. See, the ball

217
00:13:35,613 --> 00:13:36,881
Didn't go where you wanted it to go.

218
00:13:36,914 --> 00:13:38,582
No, right? Well, a bomb.

219
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:42,987
But you know, I guess you heard we're being
audited up at the lodging site.

220
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,555
Maybe you could kind of help.

221
00:13:45,122 --> 00:13:48,492
Not that we want to cook the books, you
know, but we were thinking, You know what?

222
00:13:48,492 --> 00:13:50,127
The way you keep your golf score,

223
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:53,230
You could just just wait here.

224
00:13:54,098 --> 00:13:57,801
I'll listen to me read. I mean, you can
check my golf scorecards all the way back to

225
00:13:57,801 --> 00:14:00,471
nineteen seventy three and you won't find
one discrepancy

226
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:03,874
And those are signed cards to sign them
myself.

227
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:06,810
That's good enough for me, Bob.

228
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:09,947
You probably didn't affect the leaderboard
anyway, right?

229
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:14,752
You're wondering about my scoring is that is
how I score is that is

230
00:14:14,885 --> 00:14:18,789
Oh, you all been talking about I'll tell you
what, I will put all my work aside, and you

231
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:20,791
and I'll play a game of golf. I'll start
from zero right now.

232
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,660
How about that, huh? No, no, no, no.

233
00:14:23,327 --> 00:14:24,628
Sure, that's fine. That's fine.

234
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:29,066
What I was thinking, though, is you're the
only lodge member who is with the government,

235
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:33,904
and I thought you could kind of explain what
this auditing process is and also maybe give

236
00:14:33,904 --> 00:14:35,739
us some insight tips, you know, and so on.

237
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:36,607
And what's expected?

238
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:39,310
Well, I'm with the natural resources.

239
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:45,716
I'm not with revenue, so I really don't know
much about tax deductibles and you know, that

240
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:48,452
kind of stuff, you know, I don't know
anything about that.

241
00:14:51,088 --> 00:14:52,523
Oh boy.

242
00:14:53,557 --> 00:14:54,391
Yeah, definitely some

243
00:14:54,391 --> 00:14:57,327
Bad movement there, though the whole
continent is in trouble, you know, that

244
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:03,100
Offer our our adventure.

245
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,770
This week, bill pulled something out of his
pants, which I thought originally was, some

246
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:09,540
of them a fishnet pantyhose that he wears a
party sometimes.

247
00:15:10,841 --> 00:15:14,178
And actually, it was. It was a hammock for
today's adventure.

248
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:16,780
And the first thing you got to do is kind of
unwind it.

249
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:20,150
And I think we should have just discussed,
you know, whether we're going to go clockwise

250
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,185
or counterclockwise.

251
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:22,286
And then he started. He got lots of
patients.

252
00:15:24,888 --> 00:15:26,290
That's your kind of surgery right there
anyway.

253
00:15:27,024 --> 00:15:28,091
Yeah. Look, look, look.

254
00:15:28,225 --> 00:15:29,359
Look out. Oh no.

255
00:15:30,928 --> 00:15:32,396
Wait, my only kind of.

256
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:34,231
Oh, there we switch names. Maybe that's what.

257
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:35,966
Let's look. All right.

258
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,201
Okay. All right. All right.

259
00:15:37,267 --> 00:15:39,036
I see what you mean. Anyway, we got her.

260
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:41,738
I got her and then we the trees were just
going.

261
00:15:43,273 --> 00:15:47,277
I think just a little too bit a bit further,
a little too.

262
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,847
Maybe not quite close enough together,
though, I'm trying to say.

263
00:15:50,948 --> 00:15:54,318
But on the other hand, you know, if you do
use trees that are just that little bit

264
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:57,788
extra, a bit of hard, you get a real good, a
real good tension on the

265
00:15:58,188 --> 00:16:00,457
On the unit. Maybe a little too much.

266
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:00,991
I don't know.

267
00:16:02,326 --> 00:16:10,567
Well, she's not in shape, but bills, bills,
game, you know, and try hammocks.

268
00:16:10,901 --> 00:16:15,639
There's a lot to the hammock, you know, and
I wonder how people are sleeping when they're

269
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:17,674
so darn tired from getting into the darn
thing, you know?

270
00:16:20,677 --> 00:16:23,513
So then we decided to tie all four corners
off in this way.

271
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:27,050
She wouldn't pivot on it still had a bit of
spring to her, but it wouldn't flip over.

272
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,018
So we had a whole other.

273
00:16:31,288 --> 00:16:33,123
Oh, oh, he's

274
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:38,795
50, 60 feet out there, so I figure, well,
heck, we're done with a hammock and he'll

275
00:16:38,795 --> 00:16:41,565
probably just climb down, come on down,
Bill, come on down, come on down.

276
00:16:41,932 --> 00:16:43,567
Not that way, though. Not that way, Bill.

277
00:16:45,202 --> 00:16:50,207
Oh boy. Anyway, he's OK.

278
00:16:50,374 --> 00:16:52,075
Hammocks are sure are relaxing, are they?

279
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:59,583
No, no, no, no, no.

280
00:17:00,217 --> 00:17:01,585
See, I'm not saying anything about you walk
around.

281
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:04,788
I'm just saying that most men your age have
monstrous beer guts.

282
00:17:05,989 --> 00:17:07,457
That's a major concern. Here is Harold.

283
00:17:07,624 --> 00:17:10,894
Well, I'm just saying you don't understand it
because in this day and age, we're more

284
00:17:10,894 --> 00:17:12,262
health conscious, certainly.

285
00:17:12,262 --> 00:17:14,764
And and people are watching what they're
eating and what they're drinking.

286
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:17,000
How does that plus that equal monstrous beer
gut?

287
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:22,105
That's a sign of maturity maturity.

288
00:17:22,139 --> 00:17:25,008
No, no. A giant sea turtle lived to be one
hundred and fifty.

289
00:17:25,008 --> 00:17:26,843
You don't see a monstrous beer gut on him.

290
00:17:27,077 --> 00:17:28,545
No, it's not a sign of maturity.

291
00:17:28,545 --> 00:17:30,847
It's a sign of a twenty five year chugging
log contest.

292
00:17:30,947 --> 00:17:34,050
Oh, you're not such great physical.

293
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,285
Shape yourself there, Harold.

294
00:17:36,653 --> 00:17:38,688
I don't have a beer gut.

295
00:17:39,489 --> 00:17:40,590
You have a pizza face.

296
00:17:41,858 --> 00:17:43,493
It's cool. You started it

297
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:46,429
All. Probably just the beer talking.

298
00:18:04,748 --> 00:18:06,449
Wow, we're all done making up our phony
receipts.

299
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:11,821
We got receipts for food, entertainment,
ammo, airplanes.

300
00:18:12,555 --> 00:18:16,426
I'll tell you, there isn't a scrap of paper
within 40 miles of the lodge, which has

301
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:18,028
created a bit of a problem in the eyes

302
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:20,964
Of the rat. Have you seen Douglas yet today?

303
00:18:20,997 --> 00:18:23,066
You know, he spent the entire day downtown
with a

304
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:24,534
Really strict looking guy from the
government.

305
00:18:25,568 --> 00:18:27,303
Oh, right.

306
00:18:27,337 --> 00:18:30,940
All right. Ok, well, I suppose Douglas will
explain that at tonight's lodge meeting.

307
00:18:30,974 --> 00:18:34,477
Anyway, the guy has had so darn much fun
making up all the receipts that they've kind

308
00:18:34,477 --> 00:18:37,881
of decided to do that as a as a business,
you know, for other service clubs or whoever

309
00:18:37,881 --> 00:18:41,051
needs phony receipts, they're going to call
it fraud r us.

310
00:18:41,651 --> 00:18:45,188
So they've asked the government to give them
a list of everybody was being audited and

311
00:18:45,188 --> 00:18:46,956
then they'll just start making calls.

312
00:18:47,157 --> 00:18:51,127
You know, I suppose there's a there's a flaw
and the reasoning somewhere would, by golly,

313
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:51,861
I can't spot it.

314
00:18:54,531 --> 00:18:56,933
Typekit uncle read the squeal of the possum.

315
00:18:56,966 --> 00:18:58,301
The meeting is about to begin.

316
00:18:58,435 --> 00:19:00,236
I'll be downstairs. I'll wait for you down
there.

317
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,704
But you got to hurry, though, OK?

318
00:19:01,738 --> 00:19:02,939
Ok, I'll I'll be right down.

319
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,310
I'll just zip down there and straighten out
the financial situation.

320
00:19:07,343 --> 00:19:10,847
It shouldn't take very long. And maybe if
any of you have financial problems for your

321
00:19:10,847 --> 00:19:13,449
own out there, you want some phony receipts.

322
00:19:13,483 --> 00:19:15,785
Just drop us a line that's for some bogus
stuff.

323
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:18,454
Or we can also sell you a backroom.

324
00:19:31,868 --> 00:19:34,571
Never get to sit out.

325
00:19:34,571 --> 00:19:40,143
We're to start now. Right now, we're
starting right up.

326
00:19:50,386 --> 00:19:55,658
Now, all right, first thing on the agenda is
who forgot to take the garbage out?

327
00:19:55,992 --> 00:19:58,861
Oh, recognize the doc.

328
00:19:58,861 --> 00:20:01,197
Render. Thank you, everybody.

329
00:20:01,698 --> 00:20:06,302
Thank you, Douglas. Now these these bags
contain nine million dollars worth of

330
00:20:06,302 --> 00:20:11,541
receipts. I've got a few here that I don't
think the government will accept.

331
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:15,178
I was here. This one here is for us having
our colors done.

332
00:20:16,612 --> 00:20:17,714
No go, Bill Currier.

333
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:20,850
Maybe I can get a job in the prison laundry.

334
00:20:21,217 --> 00:20:23,119
Earn five cents a day.

335
00:20:24,354 --> 00:20:25,788
Ben, they don't.

336
00:20:25,788 --> 00:20:28,057
But you'll come and see me in prison, won't
you?

337
00:20:28,925 --> 00:20:30,293
It'll be in the next cell.

338
00:20:31,527 --> 00:20:32,929
Well, didn't you tell the tax guys?

339
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:35,498
We have receipts? I even showed him.

340
00:20:36,232 --> 00:20:37,800
All he did was laugh at me.

341
00:20:40,803 --> 00:20:44,874
Just like that. You should.

342
00:20:44,874 --> 00:20:46,642
You better start praying.

343
00:20:48,845 --> 00:20:51,914
That's it. Pray it will declare ourselves a
religion.

344
00:20:53,282 --> 00:20:55,251
God. Yeah. Yeah, those guys don't pay any
tax.

345
00:20:56,552 --> 00:20:58,221
The Church of the Possum.

346
00:20:58,488 --> 00:20:59,956
I like that. Right?

347
00:21:01,457 --> 00:21:04,660
No, no. I mean, this place is a little bit
of heaven for all of us, isn't it?

348
00:21:04,694 --> 00:21:06,696
Hey, guys. Well, I don't know.

349
00:21:06,696 --> 00:21:10,233
I don't think taking the Lord's name in vain
a lot necessarily makes us a religion.

350
00:21:11,601 --> 00:21:14,036
Ok, why don't we declare ourselves a charity
medal?

351
00:21:14,504 --> 00:21:16,138
Ok. All right. Sounds great.

352
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:18,541
How about charitable golf game, huh?

353
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:25,982
But he said it ain't the least it's a in
your actions, we should declare ourselves a

354
00:21:25,982 --> 00:21:27,483
disaster area.

355
00:21:28,251 --> 00:21:33,189
Vijender, another claimed on Oh oh, I know,
I know this is what my mom does, right?

356
00:21:33,222 --> 00:21:35,825
She's got like credit cards. When they get
all full up, she just gets like new credit

357
00:21:35,825 --> 00:21:39,662
cards. Oh no, the government doesn't take
American Express.

358
00:21:41,464 --> 00:21:45,835
That's when we we borrow against our credit
cards.

359
00:21:46,602 --> 00:21:53,442
Ten thousand divided by 50 guys, it's three
hundred dollars.

360
00:21:53,442 --> 00:21:54,644
That's right. All right.

361
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:55,878
We're safe now.

362
00:21:55,911 --> 00:22:02,585
First thing tomorrow, we all hit the bank
and borrowed $300 to hundred.

363
00:22:03,486 --> 00:22:05,221
Make great. I love you.

364
00:22:05,254 --> 00:22:06,622
I love you. We're sorry.

365
00:22:15,297 --> 00:22:20,369
Wow. There's no other business built up in
there.

366
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,638
I see whoever feels

367
00:22:22,638 --> 00:22:23,672
I got to get up and entertain us.

368
00:22:23,806 --> 00:22:26,976
Oh, the guy from red to show some butter?

369
00:22:27,376 --> 00:22:33,949
You know, I'm going to tell some jokes and
then I'll go, OK.

370
00:22:34,683 --> 00:22:35,951
This guy walks into a bar.

371
00:22:36,118 --> 00:22:41,090
Yeah, which is strange because, OK, we say,
OK, two guys.

372
00:22:41,123 --> 00:22:42,558
Two guys walk into this bar.

373
00:22:45,928 --> 00:22:48,230
Oh, you can fool some of the people some of
the time.

374
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,698
But government isn't people.

375
00:22:50,699 --> 00:22:54,003
No, I think our biggest mistake was
announcing our plans on national television

376
00:22:54,403 --> 00:22:55,838
because a lot of civil servants watch this
show.

377
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,408
Actually, they take the show so they can
watch it at work.

378
00:22:59,408 --> 00:23:01,243
And that way it doesn't cut into their
quality time.

379
00:23:02,678 --> 00:23:06,282
But I suppose honesty is the best policy if
you have to have a policy.

380
00:23:07,183 --> 00:23:11,053
So we'll settle our debt with the government
by just borrowing more money.

381
00:23:11,387 --> 00:23:12,421
Hell, that's what they do.

382
00:23:13,422 --> 00:23:16,692
Anyway, my wife is watching, I'll be coming
straight home after the meeting, and I'm

383
00:23:16,692 --> 00:23:20,563
going to have to stay up late and go through
that shoebox full of receipts in the back of

384
00:23:20,563 --> 00:23:26,201
the junk drawer. And that way, we'll be
ready for the guy guys coming over tomorrow.

385
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:32,775
So until next time, on behalf of myself and
Harold and all gang up here at large.

386
00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:34,310
Keep your stick on the ice.

387
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:44,887
I got a million of them.

388
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,322
I got them. Ok.

389
00:23:46,622 --> 00:23:49,858
What do you get when you cross a mink with a
kangaroo?

390
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:58,400
Nakuru No, a fur coat with one pocket when
you got jet?

391
00:23:59,168 --> 00:24:00,502
Ok. All right.

392
00:24:00,636 --> 00:24:02,071
What's signs of a species?

393
00:24:02,071 --> 00:24:09,278
What's worse? A centipede with a sinus cold
or an elephant with athlete's feet?

394
00:24:10,746 --> 00:24:12,381
Uh, the elephant?
