1
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:08,508
(Bottling plant sounds)

2
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:10,744
IT'S "THE NEW
RED GREEN SHOW"!

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,313
HERE'S THE KEY MAN
OF POSSUM LODGE.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,416
HE'S GOT ALL THE ANSWERS
AND ALL THE KEYS!

5
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:19,853
MY UNCLE, RED GREEN!

6
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:21,821
(Applause)

7
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:22,956
THANK YOU.

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,591
LOVELY, HAROLD, LOVELY.

9
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:26,059
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

10
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:29,095
YOU GUYS MISSED
ALL THE EXCITEMENT THIS WEEK

11
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,997
DOWN AT THE POLICE STATION.

12
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,299
THE COPS PICKED UP
JIMMY GRISTLE.

13
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,901
JIMMY GRISTLE THE BOOTLEGGER?

14
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,236
I'M GLAD, BECAUSE

15
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:37,704
OPERATING A STILL IS ILLEGAL.

16
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,339
NOBODY DRANK THE STUFF.

17
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:41,875
WE USE IT
AS WINDSHIELD WIPER FLUID.

18
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:44,544
AIR WOULD FREEZE
BEFORE JIMMY'S BOOZE.

19
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:47,313
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO
TO HUMPHREY'S EVERYTHING STORE

20
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,648
AND BUY IT THERE.

21
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,350
AT TWO BUCKS A GALLON?

22
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:51,718
I DON'T THINK SO.

23
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:55,755
I'LL DRIVE WITH ZERO VISIBILITY
BEFORE I'LL DO THAT.

24
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,858
IF JIMMY CAN MAKE WIPER WASH,
SO CAN WE.

25
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,794
GO AHEAD AND OPERATE A STILL.

26
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,997
IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS,
YOU COULD ALWAYS ASK JIMMY.

27
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,865
I TOLD YOU, JIMMY'S IN JAIL.

28
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:07,333
BUT IT'S A SMALL JAIL.

29
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,803
WITH LUCK, YOU'LL BE
IN THE SAME CELL.

30
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,071
(Audience laughing)

31
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:16,109
(Horns honking)

32
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,877
(Geese honking)

33
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,882
(Quacking)

34
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,987
(Red): TODAY, WE HAVE
A LOT OF HAROLD,

35
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:29,522
WHICH IS REGRETTABLE,

36
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:33,460
BUT IT'S NOT THAT MUCH WORSE
THAN SPENDING AN AFTERNOON

37
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:34,761
WITH HAP.

38
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,430
THERE'S HAROLD AGAIN,
CREAMED BY CORN.

39
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:40,900
THERE'S HAROLD AGAIN,
BEING A GOOF -- BOY!

40
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,573
WE'RE ON THE VERGE
OF MAKING MOONSHINE.

41
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,842
WE'VE DECIDED
WHERE TO PUT THE STILL.

42
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:51,444
WE CAN START GATHERING
THE STUFF TOGETHER.

43
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,246
YOU'RE GONNA OPERATE A STILL

44
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,248
AND RISK BURNING DOWN
THE LODGE,

45
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,550
TO SAVE $1.00 ON WASHER FLUID?

46
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,285
HAROLD, IT'S THE PRINCIPLE.

47
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:00,620
AND IT'S $2.00.

48
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,856
I REFUSE TO PAY
HUMPHREY'S PRICES.

49
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:05,458
HOW HARD CAN IT BE
TO MAKE WIPER FLUID?

50
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,427
ISN'T THAT SOMETHING YOU SAID

51
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,629
WHEN YOU MADE BEER
AND IT BLEW UP?

52
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,865
BUT THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT,
HAROLD.

53
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:14,667
THEN THERE WAS
THE HAWAIIAN LUAU NIGHT.

54
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:16,402
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THAT?

55
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,438
YOU DUG THE FIRE PIT
OVER A GAS LINE.

56
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:21,741
BOY, THAT WAS A GREAT FIRE PIT.

57
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,443
(Audience laughing)

58
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,279
THAT PIG COOKED FAST,
DIDN'T IT?

59
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,748
I MEAN, BEFORE IT EXPLODED.

60
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,251
IT RAINED BACON BITS
FOR SIX DAYS.

61
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,153
THAT WAS REALLY FUN.

62
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,587
(Applause)

63
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:38,258
(Red): IN KEEPING WITH OUR PLAN
TO MAKE A STILL...

64
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,759
BOY, THAT HURT.

65
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,427
ANYWAY, BILL HAS GOT

66
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:45,431
AN ABOVE-GROUND SWIMMING POOL
TO SUPPLY WATER TO THE STILL.

67
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,767
THIS IS ONE
OF THESE CHEAPER MODELS.

68
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,769
YOU CAN HAVE A POOL INSTALLED.

69
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,838
I THINK IT'S ABOUT 5,000 BUCKS.

70
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:55,241
YOU CAN BUY ONE OF THESE THINGS
FOR ABOUT 500 BUCKS.

71
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,377
YOU TAKE A WHILE
SETTING THEM UP.

72
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,379
YOU REALIZE HOW UGLY THEY ARE.

73
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:02,115
YOU THROW THEM AWAY
AND BUY A $5,000 ONE.

74
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,716
THERE'S THE FIRST STEP.

75
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:05,285
"LEVEL THE POOL AREA."

76
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,220
LEVELLING AREAS IS KIND OF--

77
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,721
HERE, LOOK AT THIS.

78
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:11,491
THIS IS SOMETHING
YOU MAY NOT BE AWARE OF.

79
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:15,528
IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY,
YOU CAN RENT A BOBCAT

80
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,463
WITHOUT ANY PRIOR EXPERIENCE.

81
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,599
YOU DON'T NEED
A SPECIAL LICENCE.

82
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,134
YOU CAN GO ON UP THERE.

83
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,136
IF YOU HAVE
A WORKING VISA CARD

84
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,906
THAT BELONGS TO YOU OR PERHAPS
SOMEONE THAT YOU FOUND...

85
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,308
IF YOU'VE GOT THAT

86
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,511
AND THEY'RE COVERED,
YOU CAN JUST GO IN THERE.

87
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,880
THEY'RE NOT THAT HARD
TO OPERATE.

88
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,682
YOU CAN HAVE A GOOD TIME.

89
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:38,785
IT JUST GETS THE JOB DONE
THAT MUCH FASTER.

90
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:42,455
BY THE TIME YOU'RE FINISHED
WITH THE BOBCAT AND HAVE

91
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,924
ALL THE EQUIPMENT
GATHERED TOGETHER,

92
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:48,861
YOU HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO DO
THE JOB YOU WERE TRYING TO DO

93
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:51,564
BUT YOU'LL DO THAT
WITH JUST SHOVELS --

94
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,700
SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN HANDLE.

95
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,034
WE'LL BE BACK LATER

96
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,704
TO SHOW YOU
HOW THIS THING TURNS OUT.

97
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,272
GET REAL, BILL.

98
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,776
THIS IS MORE MANLY ANYWAY,
RIGHT?

99
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,547
THERE ARE MANY
SPEEDY VESSELS

100
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,216
LIKE SPEEDBOATS
AND SKI-BOATS AND THAT

101
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,418
EVEN A TIN BOAT
WITH A 25-HORSE

102
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,554
CAN GET THERE
IN NOTHING FLAT

103
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,522
SAILBOATS
TEND TO BE SLOWER

104
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,625
WHENEVER
THE SUMMER WIND STALLS

105
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,560
BUT A CANOE
CAN REALLY GET MOVING

106
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,796
WHEN YOU ACCIDENTALLY
TAKE HER OVER THE FALLS

107
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:29,469
THIS WEEK ON "HANDYMAN CORNER",
WE'LL BUILD A MACHINE

108
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:33,239
THAT WILL RUN ON THE BOOZE
FROM JIMMY GRISTLE'S STILL.

109
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,574
I HAVE A LAWNMOWER.

110
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,042
YOU GUYS ARE THINKING,

111
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,812
"WHAT KIND OF MACHINE COULD YOU
MAKE OUT OF A LAWNMOWER?"

112
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,247
WELL, THINK ABOUT IT.

113
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:42,582
HMM...

114
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,017
IT'S OBVIOUS, ISN'T IT?

115
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,685
A ROBOT! OH, YEAH!

116
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,020
I'M GONNA MAKE

117
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:49,188
A HOOCH-POWERED ANDROID --
A "HOOCHENOID".

118
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:50,556
WHEN I WAS A KID,

119
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,226
USED TO GET THE
"POPULAR MECHANICS" MAGAZINES.

120
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,662
THEY'D TALK ABOUT
HOW ROBOTS IN THE FUTURE

121
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,631
WOULD CLEAN OUR HOUSES
AND FETCH EVERYTHING FOR US.

122
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,200
SO FAR, ALL THEY'VE DONE
IS STOLEN OUR JOBS.

123
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:04,704
I'M GONNA BUILD
MY VERY OWN C3-PU...

124
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,706
OR R2-DETOX...

125
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,208
SOMETHING THAT WILL DO
MY EVERY WHIM.

126
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,444
HEY, I'M GONNA NEED A WHIM.

127
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,846
I GOT THIS WOMAN'S
WIG HEAD HERE.

128
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:16,149
WE'RE GONNA MAKE
A WOMAN ROBOT.

129
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,217
YOU WANT TO PAINT HER GOLD.

130
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:21,087
SILVER -- YOU WANT
TO PAINT HER SILVER.

131
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,423
ROBOTS SHOULD ALWAYS BE SILVER.

132
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,792
JUST LAY IT ON GOOD AND THICK.

133
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,896
THERE WE GO,
AND JUST SET THAT ASIDE.

134
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:33,199
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO
IS MAKE A SPINE,

135
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,968
WHICH IS A BUNCH OF VERTEBRAE
OR DISCS

136
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,937
KIND OF ATTACHED TOGETHER.

137
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,640
FOR THAT, WE COULD USE
HOCKEY PUCKS

138
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:44,177
AND DRILL OUT THE CENTRE
FOR YOUR SPINAL CORD.

139
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:46,179
YOU COULD USE P.V.C. PIPE

140
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:49,248
AND MAKE A PLASTIC...
PLASTIC... ROBOT...

141
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,586
I FIND THE PLASTIC
HARD TO WORK WITH.

142
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:57,323
PERSONALLY, I PREFER
THE LOOK AND FEEL OF WOOD.

143
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,826
SO I'M GONNA BUILD
A WOODEN ROBOT

144
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:02,195
AND HAVE HER "LUMBER" AROUND.

145
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,197
LUMBER AROUND.

146
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,966
ALWAYS ROOM FOR HUMOUR
IN THE WORKSHOP.

147
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,568
YOU WANNA GET THE HEAD

148
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:11,104
AND SEE HOW BIG
THE SPINE SHOULD BE,

149
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,539
YOU KNOW,
IN PROPORTION TO THE...

150
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,476
BY GOLLY.

151
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:20,413
OK, THE LACQUER HAS KIND OF
EATEN THE HEAD AWAY.

152
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,548
WE HAVE A MUCH SMALLER HEAD.

153
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:26,386
NOT ROOM FOR A VERY BIG BRAIN,
SO WE'LL MAKE IT A GUY ROBOT.

154
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:29,222
ALL RIGHT, SO STACK UP YOUR...

155
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:32,058
YOUR VARIOUS PIECES OF WOOD...

156
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,294
TILL IT LOOKS
ABOUT IN PROPORTION.

157
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,766
BY GOLLY, THAT LOOKS HUMAN
ALREADY.

158
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,968
MORE THAN MOOSE THOMPSON DOES,
ANYWAY.

159
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,536
GET YOURSELF SOME NAILS

160
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:46,806
AND JUST START NAILING
ONE VERTEBRAE TO THE NEXT.

161
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,875
IT'S JUST REALLY THAT SIMPLE.

162
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,079
I'M GONNA USE
A DIFFERENT NAIL.

163
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,781
THAT WAS THE WRONG KIND.

164
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,449
THIS IS THE RIGHT KIND.

165
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,184
SEE THIS KIND OF NAIL?

166
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,752
THIS IS...

167
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,755
BY GOLLY.

168
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,361
WE'LL GET
A DIFFERENT KIND OF NAIL.

169
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,131
ALWAYS HAVE LOTS OF KINDS OF
NAILS AROUND IN YOUR WORKSHOP.

170
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,533
NO.

171
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,034
POINTY END DOWN.

172
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,436
THEY'RE PUT...

173
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,207
(Grunting)

174
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,709
YEAH...

175
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,211
ALL RIGHT.

176
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,712
BIGGER NAIL!

177
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,281
THERE'S THE PROBLEM.

178
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,453
HUH? ANOTHER SPINAL INJURY.

179
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,254
WAIT, I GOT A BETTER IDEA

180
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:38,224
FOR SOMETHING MECHANICAL
TO BRING ME MY DRINKS

181
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,792
AND GET ME STUFF.

182
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:45,231
(Machinery whirring)

183
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,171
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

184
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,673
OK, COME ON.

185
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,374
ALL RIGHT, WHOA, WHOA!

186
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,176
HAND ME THE TRAY, HAROLD.

187
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:58,744
POUR ME A DRINK.

188
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,680
(Machinery whirring)

189
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,181
OH, OH, OH, OH!

190
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,749
HAROLD, WATCH IT!

191
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:09,255
YOU'LL NEVER REPLACE A HUMAN.

192
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:14,760
COMING UP, WHERE THERE'S SMOKE,
THERE'S A FIRE EXTINGUISHER.

193
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,366
WANT TO TALK TO YOU GUYS

194
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,568
WHO ARE SITTING THERE,
UNATTACHED,

195
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:26,105
THE VICTIMS OF A DIVORCE
OR A JOINT CHEQUING ACCOUNT.

196
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,007
YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING ABOUT

197
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:31,377
LOOKING UP THAT OLD GIRLFRIEND
YOU HAD IN HIGH SCHOOL,

198
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:34,113
THE ONE YOU TOOK
TO THE GRADUATION SOCK-HOP?

199
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,749
THERE MIGHT BE SOME APPEAL
IN RUSHING BACK

200
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:40,186
TO THE ONLY OTHER WOMAN
YOU EVER HAD A SLOW DANCE WITH,

201
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,221
BUT I'M TELLING YOU,
AS A FRIEND,

202
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,223
THINK ABOUT A COUPLE OF THINGS.

203
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,227
FIRST AND FOREMOST,
TIME HAS NOT BEEN KIND TO YOU.

204
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,930
TOO MUCH GRAVITY
AND TOO MUCH GRAVY

205
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,698
HAVE TAKEN THEIR TOLL.

206
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,233
(Audience laughing)

207
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,870
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE YOU DID
ON PAGE 77 OF THE YEARBOOK.

208
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,772
NOW ZIP OVER TO HER PICTURE.

209
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,041
TRY ADDING 30 OR 40 YEARS
TO THAT.

210
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,776
SEE WHERE I'M COMING FROM?

211
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,478
START WITH A CLEAN SLATE.

212
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,681
DATE A WOMAN YOU DIDN'T KNOW
WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG.

213
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:12,218
YOU'LL BE ATTRACTED TO HER
FOR WHAT SHE IS RIGHT NOW.

214
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:15,555
THERE WON'T BE NAGGING PICTURES
FROM 30 YEARS AGO.

215
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,256
SHE'LL MAKE SURE OF THAT.

216
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:20,793
IT MIGHT BE A NICE GESTURE
IF YOU DID THE SAME FOR HER.

217
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,862
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

218
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,764
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

219
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,600
(Audience laughing)

220
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,675
WELL, THIS IS THE LAST
OF THE STUFF

221
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,577
FROM JIMMY GRISTLE'S STILL.

222
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:40,780
WE STOLE-- I'M SORRY --
WE
 SALVAGED
 THE STUFF.

223
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,848
HOW ARE WE DOING AT THIS END?

224
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,418
I SHOULD REMIND YOU
THAT I'M AGAINST THIS.

225
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,386
I'M JUST HERE
FOR THE CHEMISTRY.

226
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,388
SAVE YOUR SPEECH FOR THE TRIAL.

227
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:50,890
I'M KIDDING YOU!

228
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,391
I'M JUST
KIDDING!

229
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,361
BUSTER'S GOT EVERYTHING GOING
IN THE KITCHEN.

230
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,296
HE'S GOT THE CAULDRON BOILING.

231
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,698
I FOUND SOME SUGAR.

232
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,466
WE NEED CORN FOR THE MASH.

233
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,468
SHOULD BE CANS IN THE KITCHEN.

234
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,203
SOME OF IT'S CREAMED CORN.

235
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,272
THAT SHOULD BE FINE.

236
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,308
WHEN JUNIOR SINGLETON
GETS HERE WITH HIS MOM'S LADA,

237
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,776
WE'RE READY TO START.

238
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,745
WHY USE HER CAR?

239
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,146
WE'LL PARK IT OUTSIDE.

240
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,983
WE'LL RUN A HOSE FROM
THE KETTLE TO THE ENGINE.

241
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,484
IT'S GONNA PROCESS IT.

242
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,821
IT'S GONNA PUMP IT, FILTER IT,
SKIM IT, PUREE IT,

243
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,256
AND DISPENSE IT
OUT THE HOLE OF THE RAD.

244
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:25,758
THAT'S THE THEORY.

245
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:26,826
IT CAN DO THAT?

246
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,995
UNCLE RED, IT'S A RUSSIAN CAR.

247
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,496
IT CAN DO ANYTHING.

248
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,765
EXCEPT START.

249
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:36,369
(Audience laughing)

250
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:39,772
WELL, HERE WE ARE
WITH HAP SHAUGHNESSY.

251
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,407
WE'RE TROLLING FOR TROUT.

252
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,876
HAP CAUGHT HIMSELF
A BEAUTY LAST WEEK.

253
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,379
SHOULD HAVE SEEN
THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY.

254
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,114
EVERY FISHERMAN SAYS THAT.

255
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,448
I SAID IT FIRST, RED.

256
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:50,783
OH, REALLY?

257
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,285
ALWAYS HAD A FLAIR
FOR THE ONE-LINERS.

258
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:54,620
"MAKE LOVE, NOT WAR.

259
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,956
"DON'T DO ANYTHING
I WOULDN'T DO.

260
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,290
"HAVE A NICE DAY."

261
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,992
THEN THERE WERE MY POEMS.

262
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,727
"MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB".

263
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,963
YOU CAME UP
WITH ALL THAT YOURSELF?

264
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,297
YOU KNEW THAT, DIDN'T YOU?

265
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:06,632
NO.

266
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,300
I WROTE BOOK AFTER BOOK.

267
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:11,804
SNAPPY SAYINGS, QUIPS, POEMS,
PHRASES, NURSERY RHYMES...

268
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:15,274
"LITTLE JACK HORNER", "LONDON
BRIDGE IS FALLING DOWN"...

269
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,609
"THREE LITTLE PIGS"...

270
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,311
"JACK AND THE BEANSTALK",
"LITTLE JACK HORNER"...

271
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,313
YOU ALREADY SAID
"LITTLE JACK HORNER".

272
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,815
THIS WAS THE SEQUEL.

273
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:26,886
YOU KNOW, HAP, I DON'T REMEMBER
EVER SEEING ANY OF THOSE BOOKS.

274
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:29,955
I'VE NEVER USED MY OWN NAME,
HAP SHAUGHNESSY.

275
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,092
I'M NOT ONE TO TAKE
A LOT OF CREDIT FOR STUFF.

276
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,261
THAT WOULD LEAD
TO LEGAL ACTION.

277
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:36,762
I USED A PEN NAME.

278
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,331
THE NAME I CHOSE
WAS ARNOLD NONYMOUS --

279
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:42,835
A. NONYMOUS FOR SHORT --
SO I DIDN'T GET ANY CREDITS.

280
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:46,105
ALL THOSE NURSERY RHYMES
AND PHRASES AND POEMS...

281
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:49,075
I'VE BEEN QUOTED MORE OFTEN
THAN SHAKESPEARE,

282
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:50,776
BUT WHO WOULD BELIEVE IT?

283
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,111
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYONE.

284
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,280
IF I HAD A NICKEL
FOR EVERY TIME I WAS QUOTED,

285
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:55,781
I'D BE A BILLIONAIRE.

286
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:57,483
IF YOU DON'T MIND ME SAYING SO,

287
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,552
IF IFS AND BUTS
WERE CANDIES AND NUTS,

288
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,287
WE'D ALL HAVE
A GREAT CHRISTMAS.

289
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:02,788
WELL, THERE YOU GO.

290
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,356
GIVE ME A NICKEL.

291
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,628
OK, THIS IS THE BIG ONE

292
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:12,531
FOR A GRAND PRIZE
YET TO BE DETERMINED.

293
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:16,936
UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO GET MR. STUYVESANT TO SAY

294
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:20,039
THIS WORD.

295
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:23,309
THIRTY SECONDS, GO.

296
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,810
UM... OBLIGATION.

297
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,312
MOTHER.

298
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,280
APPOINTMENT.

299
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,316
PROCTOLOGIST.

300
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:31,817
(Laughing)

301
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,487
WHEN YOU TELL SOMEBODY
YOU'LL BE THERE, THAT'S A...

302
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,789
LIE.

303
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:43,195
WHEN YOU CARE ABOUT SOMETHING,
IT'S BECAUSE YOU'VE MADE A...

304
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,164
BET?

305
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,665
I KNOW, I KNOW.

306
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:49,201
IF YOU GIVE YOUR GIRLFRIEND
AN ENGAGEMENT RING

307
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,736
YOU'RE MAKING A...

308
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:53,239
MISTAKE.

309
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,914
WE MAY HAVE
DOWN-PLAYED THE DANGER

310
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,316
OF MANUFACTURING
A FLAMMABLE LIQUID

311
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,686
IN AN ENCLOSED SPACE
UNDER PRIMITIVE CONDITIONS

312
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,188
NEAR AN OPEN FLAME

313
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:12,191
IN A WOODEN BUILDING
ON A SHAKY STOVE.

314
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:16,695
BUT THE FIRE'S OUT NOW, AND
I THINK THE INITIAL EXPLOSION

315
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:19,765
DID NOT DO TOO MUCH
STRUCTURAL DAMAGE.

316
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:28,641
THERE'S CREAMED CORN
EVERYWHERE!

317
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:31,243
EVERYWHERE CREAMED CORN.

318
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,647
IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY
BLEW UP IOWA.

319
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:36,882
IT'S OK --
THE FIRE IS OUT.

320
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,551
THAT CAR'S STILL BURNING.

321
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:41,954
BUT I THINK IT LANDED
FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM THE LODGE

322
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,456
THAT WE'LL LET NATURE
TAKE ITS COURSE.

323
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,692
WHAT ARE THE OTHER GUYS DOING?

324
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,929
THEY'RE IN THE KITCHEN
LICKING CORN OFF THE CUPBOARDS.

325
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,430
I'M SORRY, BUT

326
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,799
YOU HAVE TO FORGET
ABOUT DISTILING

327
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,467
YOUR WASHER FLUID STUFF.

328
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,770
THE STILL'S DESTROYED,
AND I QUIT.

329
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,305
HA-HA-HA-HA-HA.

330
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,440
YOU'LL HAVE TO
SWALLOW YOUR PRIDE

331
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:05,177
AND BUY YOUR WASHER FLUID
AT HUMPHREY'S EVERYTHING STORE.

332
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,479
REAL MEN
DON'T SWALLOW THEIR PRIDE.

333
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:08,581
WE JUST FAKE IT.

334
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:10,416
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'LL DO.

335
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:13,118
ALL WE'VE GOT LEFT
IS THE EMPTY BOTTLES.

336
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,620
OH, OH, AW!

337
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,388
I GOT-- OH, I KNOW!

338
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,190
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

339
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:21,527
WE CAN BOTTLE THE SPRING WATER
FROM POSSUM HILL.

340
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,529
WE CAN JUST BOTTLE THE WATER.

341
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,130
SPRING WATER.

342
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:28,367
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BUY
SPRING WATER, HAROLD?

343
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,302
YEAH, ALL THE TIME.

344
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,804
OK,
ALL RIGHT,

345
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,673
YOU'RE GONNA FILL BOTTLES
WITH SPRING WATER

346
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,542
AND PEOPLE WILL PAY FOR IT.

347
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,043
THAT COULD WORK.

348
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,145
MR. PERRIER ISN'T DOING SO BAD.

349
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,647
COME ON, HAROLD.

350
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,350
WHAT KIND OF GOMER'S
ARE GOING TO PAY MONEY

351
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,819
FOR WATER
THAT COMES OUT OF THE GROUND?

352
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,654
CITY PEOPLE.

353
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,155
OH WELL.

354
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,657
OH YEAH.

355
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,293
ALL RIGHT.

356
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,196
(Red): WITH US SWITCHING
TO BOTTLED WATER

357
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:00,299
THE ABOVE-GROUND POOL
MAKES EVEN MORE SENSE.

358
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:03,302
LUCKILY, WE HADN'T
COMPLETELY BUILT IT YET,

359
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,704
'CAUSE IT HAD ONLY BEEN
SEVEN DAYS.

360
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:08,207
IF YOU EVER GET
ONE OF THESE THINGS,

361
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:12,244
TRY TO LIVE IN A NEIGHBOURHOOD
WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE IN IT

362
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,713
SO THAT YOU CAN AFFORD
TO LOSE A FEW FRIENDS.

363
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,448
OH, OH, OH, OH, OH.

364
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,851
HERE'S SOMETHING
FOR YOU TEENAGERS.

365
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,953
BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU STRADDLE.

366
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,456
IT CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO
YOUR ENTIRE ADULT LIFE.

367
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,258
COME ON, BILL, UP YOU GO.

368
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,760
OH BOY.

369
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:31,030
WE'VE GOT TO PUT
THIS POOL LINER ON HERE.

370
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,832
IMAGINE MAKING A BED
WITH THIS GUY.

371
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,401
ANYWAY, WE GOT HER ON,

372
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:38,304
AND GOT A LITTLE
HANDYMAN'S SECRET WEAPON

373
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,972
SNUCK INTO THE PROJECT.

374
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,473
WHERE IS HE?

375
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,975
HOW DID HE DO THAT?

376
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,476
TUNNEL OUT, BILL,

377
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,812
LIKE THEY DID
IN "THE GREAT ESCAPE".

378
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,047
OR STAY THERE.

379
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,916
IT MIGHT MAKE
AN INTERESTING DESIGN

380
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:53,152
IN THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL.

381
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:56,622
OH MAN, WHAT DID HE HAVE
FOR BREAKFAST?

382
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:57,957
THIS IS THE PUMP.

383
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,425
IT'S A SMALL UNIT.

384
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:03,329
IT'S MADE TO PUMP WATER,
AND WE DIDN'T HAVE WATER.

385
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:07,266
THE AIR WAS UNBELIEVABLE
COMING OUT OF THAT THING.

386
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,268
I THOUGHT BILL WOULD
DO THOSE TRICKS

387
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,170
WHERE HE MAKES ANIMALS.

388
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,671
NOW, HERE... NOW, THIS...

389
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,341
OK, OK, GOODBYE, SEE YA.

390
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:19,011
BILL TRIES TO MAKE IT WORK,
AND THEN REALIZES --

391
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,512
NO, BILL.

392
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,882
IT LOOKS LIKE ON OF THEM
POPCORN MAKERS, DOESN'T IT?

393
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,584
BILL RUNS AND THEN TRIPS,

394
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,386
AND THE LADDER
HAS A SPRING EFFECT.

395
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,722
AND HE LANDS.

396
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:32,791
THEN BILL GETS THE IDEA
TO PUSH A HOLE THROUGH.

397
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:35,561
EVERYBODY OUT OF THE POOL.

398
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,296
OH MY GOSH.

399
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:38,797
OH!

400
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:42,634
AND, UH, WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE?

401
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,704
WELL, IT WAS JUST ANOTHER DAY
AT THE LODGE.

402
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,973
TWO GUYS WASTING TIME AND MONEY

403
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,010
ROLLING AROUND ON THE GROUND,
BEING GOOFY,

404
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,145
ENDING UP WRAPPED IN PLASTIC.

405
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:56,181
MAN.

406
00:16:56,248 --> 00:17:00,219
DOUGIE'S GOT ADVICE
FOR YOU GUYS IN TROUBLE.

407
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,692
WELL, DALTON HUMPHREY
TAKES THE CAKE.

408
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,661
TRY TO DO SOMETHING GOOD
FOR LOCAL COMMERCE,

409
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,430
WHAT DOES IT GET YA?

410
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:15,067
IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING,
WHY NOT SETTLE YOUR BILLS?

411
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,102
THIS ISN'T ABOUT PAYING BILLS.

412
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,339
I TOOK A BUNCH OF
POSSUM SPRING WATER DOWN THERE

413
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:23,142
TO SEE IF THEY COULD SELL IT,
AND THEY SAY

414
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,810
"IT'S GOT TO BE TESTED."

415
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,613
TURNS OUT IT'S GOT
SO MANY MINERALS IN IT,

416
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,281
THE ICICLES POINT NORTH.

417
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,150
SO NOBODY WANTS IT?

418
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:35,054
THE CENTRE FOR DISEASE CONTROL
ORDERED A COUPLE OF CASES.

419
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,423
I GUESS THE MORAL FOR TODAY IS

420
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,925
IF YOU WANT WASHER FLUID,
BUY IT.

421
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,227
YOU GOT OFF EASY
CONSIDERING THERE WAS

422
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,296
ONLY ONE EXPLOSION,
ONE KITCHEN FIRE,

423
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:45,831
AND THAT CAR'S BURNING.

424
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,267
LOOKS LIKE AN OIL FIRE
IN KUWAIT.

425
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,202
I CAN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

426
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:53,872
I'M STUCK WITH 2,000 BOTTLES
WITH NOTHING IN 'EM.

427
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,708
THAT'S NOT TRUE --
THERE'S AIR IN THEM.

428
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,544
WELL, THAT'S ALMOST NOTHING.

429
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,045
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

430
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,780
IT'S NOT JUST ANY AIR.

431
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,982
IT'S THE AIR OF POSSUM HILLS.

432
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,218
WE COULD START A TREND HERE.

433
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,053
POSSUM AIR?

434
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,556
THIS IS THE PERFECT
YUPPIE PRODUCT.

435
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:14,226
FAT-FREE, CHOLESTEROL-FREE,
SUGAR-FREE, SALT-FREE,

436
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,161
NO ADDITIVES, NO CALORIES.

437
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,497
WE'LL CALL IT "POSSUM LIGHT".

438
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,666
SHE HAD THAT CHAT WITH YOU

439
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:24,670
ABOUT HOW SHE GETS STUCK
DOING ALL THE HOUSEWORK.

440
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:28,140
YOU TOLD HER YOU'D HELP
A LITTLE MORE, DIDN'T YA?

441
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:30,843
YOU SAID YOU'D PICK UP
AFTER YOURSELF.

442
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,812
NOW SHE'S CALLING YOU
INTO THE BEDROOM.

443
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,682
AND IT'S NOT FOR
WHAT YOU HOPE IT IS.

444
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:41,920
AT HER FEET IS A HUMUNGOUS PILE
OF YOUR USED UNDERWEAR.

445
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:45,524
DON'T TRY SAYING SOMETHING
STUPID LIKE

446
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:49,128
"I'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR THEM."

447
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,964
BE CLEVER AND
TURN THE TABLES ON HER.

448
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,733
LOOK DOWN AND GO
"THOSE AREN'T MINE.

449
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,202
"HAVE YOU BEEN SEEING SOMEONE?"

450
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,204
NO -- DWELL ON THE POSITIVE.

451
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:02,808
SAY "STORING USED UNDERWEAR
IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CLOSET

452
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,676
"IS GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT

453
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:07,279
"'CAUSE YOU USE
LESS LAUNDRY DETERGENT."

454
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:08,814
AND BRING UP THE POINT,

455
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:12,784
AT LEAST YOU'RE NOT LEAVING IT
AROUND THE KITCHEN ANY MORE.

456
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:17,322
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT PORTION
OF THE SHOW.

457
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,992
THIS WEEK'S EXPERTS ARE
MY UNCLE RED

458
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:22,728
AND HIS FRIEND,
MR. DALTON HUMPHREY.

459
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:26,398
(Applause and cheering)

460
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,100
OUR LETTER GOES AS FOLLOWS.

461
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,601
"DEAR EXPERTS"

462
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,570
AH-AH-AH.

463
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,105
"MY CAR IS A WRECK.

464
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:37,442
"WHAT DO YOU DO WITH A CAR
THAT'S TOO WRECKED TFIX?"

465
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,945
OBVIOUSLY, YOUE GOT TO
SELL THE PIG.

466
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,015
THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE UNETHICAL,
MR. HUMPHREY.

467
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:45,784
SELLING A CAR THAT'S
UNSAFE AND WORTHLESS.

468
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,987
YOU WOULDN'T SELL IT
TO ANYBODY YOU KNOW.

469
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,357
YEAH, I WOULD.

470
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,426
NO, NO, NO,

471
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:55,928
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

472
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,596
MY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS

473
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:00,599
ARE A TREASURED
AND WONDERFUL PART OF MY LIFE.

474
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,168
I TRULY VALUE EACH OF THEM.

475
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:06,939
I HAVE TO SAY THAT I AM BLESSED
TO HAVE

476
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,907
SO MANY OF THEM IN MY LIFE.

477
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:11,210
BUT, WELL, HEY,
A BUCK'S A BUCK.

478
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:14,546
I THINK A LOT OF IT IS
THE WORDING OF THE AD.

479
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:18,550
YOU'VE GOT TO SAY, LIKE,
"FOR SALE, AS IS, WHERE IS."

480
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,519
OR "CAR FOR SALE,

481
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:23,822
"STOPS AND GOES,
MOSTLY STOPS."

482
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:28,527
OR, "GREAT VEHICLE FOR
PEOPLE WHO HATE TRAVELLING."

483
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,729
THAT'S NOT LYING.

484
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,998
THAT'S JUST GOOD SALESMANSHIP.

485
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,033
SAY THE FLOORBOARD'S RUSTED.

486
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,736
SAY THAT'S GOT
A CLASSIC INTERIOR.

487
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,238
CLASSIC?

488
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,840
LIKE THE FLINTSTONE'S CAR.

489
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,709
SEE, NOW THAT'S NOT LYING.

490
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:46,178
THAT'S
PERJURY.                THAT'S
SALESMANSHIP.

491
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,213
HAROLD, DIDN'T
I SEE YOU

492
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,417
TALKING TO THAT COUNSELLOR,
TRYING TO GET A DATE?

493
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,753
HOW DID YOU
DESCRIBE YOURSELF?

494
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,755
HA-HA-HA-HA-HA.

495
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,257
HA-HA.

496
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:01,426
I MIGHT HAVE SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

497
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:04,696
SOMETHING ABOUT BEING
TALL, DARK AND HANDSOME.

498
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,965
RATHER THAN TALL,
DORK AND USELESS.

499
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:10,702
THAT'S ABOUT AS HONEST AS
OUR CAR SALES PITCH, ISN'T IT?

500
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,705
NOT REALLY --
THE GIRL DIDN'T BREAK DOWN.

501
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,176
YOU SHOULD LOOK AT SOMETHING
WITH MORE MILES ON HER.

502
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,279
(Laughing)

503
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,683
I THOUGHT WE WERE
ONTO SOMETHING.

504
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,819
SHOWS WHAT I KNOW
ABOUT YUPPIES IN LOS ANGELES.

505
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,321
LOS ANGELES?

506
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:33,191
YOUR AIR WAS TURNED DOWN
BY LOS ANGELES?

507
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:35,527
YEAH, THEY SAY
IT SMELLS FUNNY.

508
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,462
I THINK WE MADE A MISTAKE

509
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,365
PUTTING THAT DEAD POSSUM
ON THE LABEL.

510
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,401
YOU COULD HAVE RINSED
THE BOTTLES OUT FIRST.

511
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,537
DOESN'T MATTER --
I TOOK THE BOTTLES BACK.

512
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:47,439
I GOT ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY

513
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:50,208
12 GALLONS
OF WINDSHIELD WIPER FLUID.

514
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:54,646
THIS WINTER I'LL BE LETTING HER
FLY ANY TIME I FEEL LIKE IT.

515
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,581
THERE'S A LESSON FOR YOU.

516
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,251
NOT TO MAKE A STILL
OUT OF A RUSSIAN CAR

517
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,421
OR BOTTLE WATER OR CAN AIR
DURING MANURE SEASON,

518
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,690
WHEN ALL YOU WANT
IS WASHER FLUID?

519
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:07,693
NO -- THE LESSON IS,
WHEN YOU GET TO MY AGE

520
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,494
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LET

521
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:12,698
A LITTLE SQUIRT GO
ANY TIME YOU FEEL LIKE IT.

522
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:16,702
(Possum
squeal)

523
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:18,203
MEETING TIME.

524
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,439
I'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.

525
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,675
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,
I'LL BE HOME AFTER THE MEETING.

526
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,745
WHEN OUR NEIGHBOURS SEE
HOW CLEAN OUR WINDSHIELD IS

527
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,814
THEY'LL THINK WE HAVE
SO MUCH MONEY

528
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,982
WE'VE STOPPED BUYING
SELF-SERVE GAS.

529
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,552
TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

530
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:36,221
ON BEHALF OF HAROLD,
MYSELF AND THE GANG,

531
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,223
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

532
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:43,362
(Applause)

533
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:45,297
(Possum squeal)

534
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,735
(Harold): OK.

535
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,636
ALL RISE.

536
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:59,244
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

537
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,246
(Red): SIT DOWN, GUYS.

538
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:04,049
(Harold): WE SHOULD BEGIN BY

539
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:07,386
READING THE MINUTES
OF LAST WEEK.
