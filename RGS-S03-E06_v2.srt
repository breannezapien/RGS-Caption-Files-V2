131
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,315
'HANDYMAN CORNER' WE'RE GOING

132
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:10,583
TO SHOW YOU A FEW THINGS YOU

133
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,051
CAN DO WITH YOUR CLOTHES DRYER

134
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,419
DURING THOSE REGULAR 3 OR 4

135
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,487
MONTHS HIATUSES BETWEEN

136
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,388
LAUNDRY DAY.

137
00:04:16,388 --> 00:04:17,990
I'M SURE A LOT OF OUR VIEWERS

138
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,091
MAKE THE MODEL PLANES AND YOU

139
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:20,326
GET PAINTING THEM UP WITH THAT

140
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:21,627
SPECIAL LACQUER ON THERE THAT

141
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:22,661
LOOKS SO GOOD BUT IT'S VERY,

142
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:23,829
VERY HARD ON THE EYES

143
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:24,830
AND SO ON.

144
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,731
NOW WOULDN'T IT BE NICE

145
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:26,565
TO HAVE A NICE PLACE TO

146
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:27,466
DRY THOSE IN?

147
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:28,334
WELL I SUGGEST THAT WHAT YOU

148
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,301
DO IS TAKE THE SPINNING

149
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:30,469
DRUM OUT OF YOUR DRYER,

150
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:31,604
PUT SOME SHELVES IN THERE

151
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,038
AND YOU CAN JUST LAY THE PLANES

152
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:34,740
OR WHATEVER IN THERE REAL NICE,

153
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,008
YOU GOT THE HEAT,

154
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:37,009
IT'S DUST FREE AND IT'LL TAKE

155
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:38,043
THE FUMES AND PUSH THEM

156
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:39,011
RIGHT OUTSIDE INTO YOUR

157
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:40,446
NEIGHBOUR'S YARD.

158
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,647
SO I SUGGEST YOU JUST SET

159
00:04:41,647 --> 00:04:43,382
THE CONTROL ON THE DELICATE

160
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:52,958
AND RUN HER FOR ABOUT AN HOUR.

161
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:53,692
I DON'T KNOW, THAT IS

162
00:04:53,692 --> 00:04:55,494
INTERESTING BECAUSE I HAD

163
00:04:55,494 --> 00:04:57,363
SPECIFICALLY ASKED HAROLD

164
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,598
TO REMOVE THE SPINNING DRUM

165
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:00,833
BUT WELL HE'S EITHER FORGOTTEN

166
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,001
OR MAYBE HE GOT TOO BUSY

167
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,770
SIMONIZING HIS HEAD.

168
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,537
SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

169
00:05:05,537 --> 00:05:07,673
HERE IS 3 YEARS OF MODEL

170
00:05:07,673 --> 00:05:10,042
BUILDING DOWN THE TUBES,

171
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:12,411
OH I'M GLAD THEY WEREN'T MINE.

172
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:13,345
ALL RIGHT I'LL SHOW YOU

173
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:14,179
SOMETHING ELSE THAT

174
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:15,047
YOU CAN DO WITH YOUR DRYER,

175
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:16,048
BUT FOR THIS ONE WE DEFINITELY

176
00:05:16,048 --> 00:05:17,216
HAVE TO REMOVE THE SPINNING

177
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:19,084
DRUM WHICH IS NO BIG DEAL,

178
00:05:19,084 --> 00:05:20,552
USUALLY IT'S GOT SOME SCREWS

179
00:05:20,552 --> 00:05:22,421
ON THE BACK HERE OR THERE

180
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:24,156
MIGHT BE SOME WING NUTS,

181
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:26,392
NOT A BIG JOB, MAYBE IT'S THE

182
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:28,394
LOCKING CLIPS ON THIS MODEL,

183
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,194
NO, NO, MAYBE IT GOT THE

184
00:05:29,194 --> 00:05:32,731
SLIDERS... NO.

185
00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:34,066
WELL I GUESS SHE'S PROBABLY

186
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:37,069
JUST A PRESS FIT.

187
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:43,509
(REPEATED THUDS OF HAMMERING)

188
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,779
WHERE WE ARE NOW IS WHAT WE

189
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:47,713
CALL THE POINT OF NO RETURN

190
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:51,316
FOR HANDYMAN WHERE IN ORDER

191
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:52,718
FOR ME TO CONTINUE TRYING

192
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:55,020
TO GET THE SPINNING DRUM

193
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,854
OUT OF THE DRYER WHICH IS

194
00:05:55,854 --> 00:05:56,822
MORE TROUBLE THAN IT'S WORTH,

195
00:05:56,822 --> 00:05:57,790
I HAVE TO MAKE THE CONSCIOUS

196
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,826
DECISION TO TAKE THIS PERSONALLY

197
00:06:00,826 --> 00:06:02,094
BASICALLY WHAT I'M SAYING

198
00:06:02,094 --> 00:06:03,695
IS THIS IS MY DRYER,

199
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:05,297
I OWN THIS DRYER,

200
00:06:05,297 --> 00:06:06,165
I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT

201
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:07,366
WITH THIS DRYER,

202
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,667
WHEREAS WHAT THE DRYER

203
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:12,137
IS SAYING TO ME IS OH NO, NO,

204
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:13,605
NO, YOU STUPID, BURNT OUT,

205
00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:15,340
OLD MAN, THERE'S NO WAY

206
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,776
YOU'RE GETTING ANYWHERE NEAR

207
00:06:17,776 --> 00:06:20,012
MY SPINNING DRUM AND TO ME THIS

208
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:20,879
IS AN ATTITUDE THAT

209
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:22,014
REQUIRES AN ADJUSTMENT OF

210
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:31,590
SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION.

211
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,158
ALL RIGHTY I DIDN'T

212
00:06:33,158 --> 00:06:33,892
GET EVERYTHING OUT,

213
00:06:33,892 --> 00:06:34,693
I LEFT THE MOTOR AND BELTS

214
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:35,527
AND STUFF, I DON'T

215
00:06:35,527 --> 00:06:36,562
THINK THEY DO MUCH.

216
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,563
I GOT THE DRUM OUT THAT'S

217
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,430
THE MAIN THING, NOW WHAT

218
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,531
YOU WANT TO DO IS YOU WANT

219
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:40,532
TO TAKE A MARKER OF SOME KIND

220
00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:43,068
AND YOU WANT TO DRAW A HOLE

221
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:44,937
ON THE TOP HERE JUST ABOUT

222
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,505
THE SAME SIZE AS YOUR HEAD

223
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:47,906
OR IF YOU GOT A SMALL HEAD

224
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:48,774
I GUESS YOU COULD DRAW IT

225
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:50,642
THE SIZE OF YOUR HAT,

226
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:51,977
NOW ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT

227
00:06:51,977 --> 00:06:53,412
NOW YOU CAN TAKE OFF ALL

228
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,246
YOUR CLOTHES AND GET A JIGSAW,

229
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:55,147
NO, NO, NO, NO,

230
00:06:55,147 --> 00:06:56,381
GET A JIGSAW AND THEN

231
00:06:56,381 --> 00:06:58,517
TAKE OFF ALL YOUR CLOTHES

232
00:06:58,517 --> 00:06:59,384
I'M NOT MAKING THAT

233
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:01,620
MISTAKE AGAIN...

234
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,554
NOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS

235
00:07:02,554 --> 00:07:03,455
CUT THAT THING OUT BECAUSE

236
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:04,356
YOUR HEAD'S GOT TO POP

237
00:07:04,356 --> 00:07:05,123
THROUGH THERE,

238
00:07:05,123 --> 00:07:05,757
WHEN YOU COME BACK BE NAKED,

239
00:07:05,757 --> 00:07:07,092

00:08:05,283 --> 00:08:11,456

00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,137
IN COMPUTERS, YOU KNOW LIKE

277
00:08:26,137 --> 00:08:27,339
THEOREMS AND LOGICAL

>>DOUGIE: WELL YOU KNOW THAT IS

282
00:08:37,882 --> 00:08:41,686
A DANDY QUESTION, BUT YOU KNOW

283
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:42,887
I CAN'T ANSWER IT BECAUSE THEY

284
00:08:42,887 --> 00:08:43,722
DIDN'T REALLY MENTION WHAT

285
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:56,601
MAKE OF CAR IT WAS THEY BOUGHT.

286

287
00:08:57,335 --> 00:09:00,305
SAY IT WAS A FORD PRODUCT.

>>DOUGIE: OKAY A FORD PRODUCT,

289
00:09:03,141 --> 00:09:05,410
WELL OF COURSE YOUR BULLION

290
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,245
LOGIC IS LESS IMPORTANT IN YOUR

291
00:09:07,245 --> 00:09:10,882
FORD THAN SAY YOUR G.M. PRODUCT,

292
00:09:10,882 --> 00:09:11,883
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE

293
00:09:11,883 --> 00:09:14,019
IMPORTANT THAN A CHRYSLER,

294
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:15,954
NOW YOUR DOMESTIC BULLION LOGIC

295
00:09:15,954 --> 00:09:17,188
BY AND LARGE IS NOT QUITE AS

296

FANCY, INTRICATE OR CONVOLUTED

297
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:30,535
AS YOUR IMPORTED BULLION LOGIC,

298
00:09:30,535 --> 00:09:32,704
BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE TO HAVE

299
00:09:32,704 --> 00:09:38,676
LIKE A SET THEORY BREAKDOWN.

300
00:09:38,676 --> 00:09:39,544
OF COURSE IT'D BE A LOT EASIER

301
00:09:39,544 --> 00:09:40,478
TO GET YOUR AND/OR GATES

302
00:09:40,478 --> 00:09:41,679

OH JEEZ AND YOU KNOW,

305
00:09:51,122 --> 00:09:52,957
LORD KNOWS IF YOU'RE INTENDING

306
00:09:52,957 --> 00:10:00,298
ON REBUILDING A DOMESTIC THEOREM

307
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:00,965
IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT EASIER

308
00:10:00,965 --> 00:10:01,599
THAN ONE OF THOSE FLIMSY,

309
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,702
IMPORTED JOBS

310
00:10:04,702 --> 00:10:09,407
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

311
00:10:10,842 --> 00:10:11,943
>>RED: IT IS WINTER,

312
00:10:11,943 --> 00:10:13,011
WE HITCH THE HORSE UP

313
00:10:13,011 --> 00:10:13,945
TO THE SLEIGH LIKE

314
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:15,713
GRANDFATHER USE TO DO,

315
00:10:15,713 --> 00:10:17,215
OVER HILLS AND THROUGH THE DALES

316
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,484
WE GLIDE FOR AN HOUR OR 2,

317
00:10:19,484 --> 00:10:21,019
AND SOON MY EARS ARE BRITTLE

318
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:22,987
AND MY MOUTH IS FROZEN SHUT,

319
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:24,622
MY EYES ARE LOCKED WIDE OPEN

320
00:10:24,622 --> 00:10:28,059
AND ALL I SEE IS A HORSE'S BUTT.

321
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:31,796
>>RED: OKAY SO WHAT YOU

322
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:32,630
HAVE IS YOUR VERY OWN

323
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,433
HIGH FASHION, SWEDISH SAUNA.

324
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:37,135
YOU JUST TURN ON THE HEAT

325
00:10:37,135 --> 00:10:37,869
AND IT'LL SWEAT THE WORRIES

326
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:40,271
AND THE POUNDS AWAY.

327
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:41,406
AND BY GOLLY IT FEELS AWFUL GOOD

328
00:10:41,406 --> 00:10:43,007
AND IF YOU'VE GOT A LINT FILTER

329
00:10:43,007 --> 00:10:43,875
THERE, IT'LL EVEN CLEAN OUT

330
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,510
YOUR BELLY BUTTON FOR YOU.

331
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,612
SO YOU SET THE SETTING

332
00:10:47,612 --> 00:10:48,279
ON THE DRYER TO WHATEVER

333
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:49,347
SUITS YOUR STYLE,

334
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:50,715
MAYBE YOU'RE NORMAL OR DELICATE

335
00:10:50,715 --> 00:10:52,750
OR MAYBE A HOT, FAST TUMBLE

336
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,918
IS THE WAY YOU GO.

337
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:54,786
PERSONALLY I'M A PERMANENT

338
00:10:54,786 --> 00:10:56,788
PRESS KIND OF A GUY,

339
00:10:56,788 --> 00:10:57,622
SO I'M GOING TO HAVE A SAUNA

RIGHT NOW BUT YOU KEEP THIS

341
00:10:58,456 --> 00:10:59,457
IN MIND, IF THE WOMEN DON'T

342
00:10:59,457 --> 00:11:00,458
FIND YOU HANDSOME, THEY SHOULD

343
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:04,028
AT LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

(DRYER RUMBLING)

345
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:16,140

346
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,308
OF THOSE BIG TANKS TO GET RID OF

347
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:18,810
SO I THOUGHT MAYBE I COULD PAWN

348
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,011

349

>>GORD: (SCREAMING) NO!

358
00:11:37,061 --> 00:11:38,696
NO, ALL RIGHT,

359
00:11:38,696 --> 00:11:40,131
IT'S FINE, COME IN.

360
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:41,132
>>RED: BOY THAT'S A HECK OF A

00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:49,373
>>GORD: WELL THEY DON'T,

366
00:11:49,373 --> 00:11:50,508
SO WHAT I DID WAS I DREW

367
00:11:50,508 --> 00:11:52,710
A PICTURE ON MY LINOLEUM FLOOR

368
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,611

ONLY 5 MONTHS THE SECOND TIME.

00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:03,020
>>RED: GOOD FOR YOU GORD.

374
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,855

FLIPPED HER UP ON THE REAR END,

491
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,244
WENT UP ON TOP AND DRILLED

492
00:14:40,244 --> 00:14:41,078
A HOLE DOWN THROUGH HER,

493
