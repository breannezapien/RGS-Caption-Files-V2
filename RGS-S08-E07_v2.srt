1
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:05,905
DID YOU KNOW YOU CAN MOW YOUR

2
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:07,907
THERE. LEAVE THAT ON
THERE FOR THREE DAYS.

3
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:10,343
IT'LL STUNT THE GRASS
TO JUST THE RIGHT HEIGHT.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,345
THEN YOU FLIP AROUND
TO THE NEXT PATCH.

5
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:13,847
CUT YOUR MOWING TIME IN HALF.

6
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:17,017
AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
WITH ALL THAT TIME YOU SAVED?

7
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,019
WELL, USUALLY, WHEN
YOU FLIP THE BOARD OVER,

8
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:20,520
SHE'S COVERED
WITH GRUBS AND WORMS.

9
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,822
PICK THEM OFF AND GO FISHING.

10
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:27,627
IT'S THE RED GREEN SHOW!

11
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,630
AND NOW HERE'S THE MAN
WHO KNOWS WHEN TO HOLD 'EM

12
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,933
AND WHEN TO FOLD 'EM, THAT'S
WHY HE'S IN CHARGE OF THE LODGE

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,569
CHAIR, YOUR HOST AND HERO,
MY UNCLE RED GREEN.

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,815
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

15
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,617
APPRECIATE IT. BOY, OH, BOY.

16
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:52,419
BIG, BIG ACCIDENT UP
AT THE BRIDGE

17
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,421
OVER MERCURY CREEK
THERE, HAROLD.

18
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,423
I HEARD ALL ABOUT IT --
A TRUCK DRIVER

19
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:57,924
LOST CONTROL, DUMPING
HIS ENTIRE LOAD...

20
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:01,828
YEAH, SO DID THE TRUCK.

21
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,465
ONE OF THOSE FREAK
ACCIDENTS, REALLY, YOU KNOW.

22
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:08,468
THIS TIME OF YEAR, THE
SALMON ARE TRYING TO JUMP

23
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:11,337
THE RAPIDS THERE, AND
HE JUST HAPPENED TO BE GOING BY

24
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,839
WITH HIS WINDOWS OPEN.

25
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,340
OH, BOY, I HOPE

26
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,842
THE DRIVER
WASN'T HURT.

27
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,577
OH, NO, HE'S GOING TO BE OK.

28
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:21,047
HE TOOK A 5-POUND COHO
AT THE ADAM'S APPLE THERE.

29
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,550
HE'S IN THE HOSPITAL.
HE'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

30
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:26,052
LIKE I SAID, BUT HE CAN'T TALK.
WHAT A MESS.

31
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,554
I MEAN, THERE WAS
APRICOTS EVERYWHERE.

32
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,155
APRICOTS, HUH?

33
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,690
400 CASES OF THEM.

34
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,394
YEAH, WE'RE AFRAID THEY'RE GOING
TO GO BAD, SO WE PUT THEM ALL

35
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,329
IN THE MOOSE THOMPSON'S
GARAGE FOR SAFEKEEPING.

36
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:40,767
AND I'LL TELL YOU, THEY'RE
PRETTY GOOD EATING.

37
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,769
YOU'RE EATING STOLEN GOODS.

38
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,904
YEAH.

39
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:47,407
WELL, HOW DOES
IT TASTE?

40
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,442
WELL, LIKE AN APRICOT.

41
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:53,246
BUT YOU GET USED TO IT.

42
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,855
IT'S TIME TO PLAY
THE POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME.

43
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:04,357
AND TODAY'S GRAND PRIZE IS FOR
ANYONE WHO'S EVER DREAMED

44
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,860
OF TAKING ALL THE ROAD MAPS
AND THROWING THEM AWAY,

45
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:09,863
AND JUMPING INTO A BRAND-NEW
4X4 VEHICLE, DRIVING ACROSS

46
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:14,367
THIS BIG BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY
OF OURS, HA, HA, HA...

47
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,603
IT'S A GARBAGE BAG.

48
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,606
GO AHEAD, THROW ALL OF YOUR
ROAD MAPS RIGHT IN THERE.

49
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,441
IT'LL HOLD UP TO 100 ROAD MAPS.

50
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,209
[chuckling]

51
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,879
ALL RIGHTY, UNCLE RED,
YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS TO GET

52
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,882
MR. DALTON HUMPHREY TO
SAY THE FOLLOWING WORD:

53
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:33,386
VEGETABLE...VEGETABLE.

54
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:34,888
ALL RIGHT,
HAROLD.

55
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,389
GO!

56
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,591
ALL RIGHT, DALTON,
MEAT AND...

57
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,093
GRAVY!

58
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,794
NO, UH, MEAT AND GRAVY AND...

59
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,930
STEAK, BIG STEAK.

60
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,432
NO, UH, NO, OK.
WITH A STEAK YOU HAVE...

61
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,934
BACON?

62
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,670
OK, NOW, DALTON,
BACON IS MEAT, OK?

63
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,306
THIS ISN'T MEAT,
BUT SOMETHING YOU EAT.

64
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,041
HOT DOG.

65
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,043
NO, UM, ALL RIGHT, NO.

66
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,914
MEAT IS PROTEIN, RIGHT, BUT
CORN, CARROTS AND PEAS IS...

67
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,615
UNEATEN.

68
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,117
OK, ALL RIGHT.

69
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:08,254
YOU GOT A CAULIFLOWER,
ASPARAGUS, SPINACH: THAT'S...

70
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,523
PUNISHMENT.

71
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,358
ALMOST OUT OF
TIME, UNCLE RED.

72
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,093
OK, DALTON, DALTON.
YOU KNOW YOUR DAD,

73
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,496
HE NEVER ATE A SALAD;
HE NEVER ATE

74
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,998
ANY GREEN STUFF HIS WHOLE--
JUST MEAT, ALL RIGHT.

75
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,134
AND AFTER 70 YEARS
OF EATING MEAT, HE'S...

76
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,802
A COMPLETE VEGETABLE.

77
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,378
THAT WAS THE WORST CASE
OF GLUTTONY I'VE EVER SEEN

78
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,080
SINCE THE GIANT MEATBALL NIGHT.

79
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,349
EVEN THE SALAD WAS DISGUSTING,

80
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,651
WITH 200 MEN SLURPING
ON ORANGE GOO.

81
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,921
YOU GUYS GOT TO STOP
EATING THOSE APRICOTS.

82
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,423
WE CAN'T, WE JUST CAN'T, HAROLD.

83
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,626
WE DON'T LIKE THEM, BUT YOU
CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE.

84
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:50,163
YOU WANT TO TRY ONE OF THESE,
HAROLD? THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD.

85
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,798
NO, THAT'S
ILL-GOTTEN FRUIT.

86
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:54,901
I'LL HAVE NO PART
IN TRAFFICKING OF HOT FRUIT.

87
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,402
NO! NO!

88
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:57,904
JUST A LITTLE
BITE, HAROLD.

89
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,405
NO!

90
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,307
NO, NO, NO.

91
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,383
YOU KNOW, THERE'S GREAT
KNOWLEDGE IN THESE.

92
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,354
JUST A LITTLE BITE.

93
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,855
YOU'LL LEARN
SOMETHING,

94
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,357
YOU'LL LEARN
SOMETHING.

95
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,858
WELL, MAYBE JUST
ONE LITTLE BITE.

96
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,360
BITE, CAN'T
HURT YOU, HUH?

97
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,996
AH, SOUR.

98
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,497
EH? EH?

99
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:27,000
YOU DIDN'T KNOW
THAT BEFORE, DID YOU?

100
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,774
OH, WE GOT A GUY NAMED
SHORTY O'TOOLE 

101
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,576
STANDS ABOUT 4 FEET ZIP 

102
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,611
WITH AN UGLY FACE
AND CRAZY HAIR 

103
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,647
AND A PERSONALITY
THAT'S REALLY A PIP 

104
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:43,082
BUT SHORTY MARRIED
A BEAUTIFUL GIRL 

105
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,285
WHO WORKS WITH HIM
DAY AND NIGHT 

106
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,153
SHE COULD HAVE HAD
ANY MAN IN TOWN 

107
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,255
BUT APPARENTLY
SHE'S AFRAID OF HEIGHTS 

108
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,728
YOU KNOW, ONE OF MY WIFE'S
FAVOURITE EXPRESSIONS IS:

109
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,230
"GET A GRIP."

110
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,731
AT LEAST AROUND ME.

111
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,733
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN
YOU THINK OF IT,

112
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,236
TREADWEAR AND TIRE GRIP AREN'T
JUST MY WIFE'S CONCERNS.

113
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,771
SO THIS WEEK,
ON HANDYMAN CORNER,

114
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:08,741
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW YOU
CAN TURN REGULAR ALL-SEASON

115
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,244
DEEP-TREAD TIRES
INTO SMOOTH RACING SLICKS

116
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,513
USING THIS FLAME-THROWER.

117
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:17,817
ALL RIGHT, LET'S JACK UP
THE CAR AND GET TO THOSE TIRES.

118
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,456
[grunting]

119
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,399
ALL RIGHT,
THIS JACK DOESN'T SEEM

120
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,401
TO BE WORKING ALL THAT WELL.

121
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:38,404
AND EVEN IF IT WAS, IT WOULD
ONLY RAISE THE CAR UP

122
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,907
A FEW INCHES, WHICH
IS NO GOOD TO US.

123
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:42,909
WE NEED SOMETHING
TO RAISE THIS UNIT UP

124
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,410
TO A MORE WORKABLE LEVEL.

125
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,412
YOU KNOW, LIKE ONE
OF THOSE HYDRAULIC JACKS

126
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,914
THAT THE MECHANICS
HAVE, YOU KNOW.

127
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,649
SO THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE GOING TO DO.

128
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:52,085
WE'RE GOING TO BUILD ONE
OF THOSE SUPER-DUPER,

129
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,586
HEAVY-DUTY HIGH-TILTING JACKS.

130
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,655
WE'LL MAKE THE RACING
SLICKS ANOTHER DAY.

131
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,857
[crashing]

132
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,760
AND AT THAT TIME, I'LL SHOW
YOU HOW TO FIX A BARBECUE.

133
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:06,199
NOW, ALL WE GOT TO DO
IS JUST RAISE THE ANGLE

134
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:09,202
ON THE CAR THERE, SO YOUR
WHEELS ARE RIGHT AT EYE LEVEL.

135
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,204
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE
TO DO ANY BENDING.

136
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,872
[chuckling]

137
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,374
[grunting]

138
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,144
BOY, YOU KNOW, EVEN THESE SMALL
CARS ARE STILL FAIRLY HEAVY.

139
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,388
ALL RIGHT, THAT SHOULD DO IT.

140
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,761
I'M NOT HEAVY ENOUGH.

141
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:37,063
WAIT TILL I TELL BERNICE.

142
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,564
ALL RIGHT, WE TALKED THIS OVER.

143
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:41,067
HAROLD SAID THAT
IF I WANT TO LIFT THE CAR,

144
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,369
MY LEVER'S GOING
TO HAVE TO BE LONGER.

145
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:44,871
QUITE A BIT LONGER.

146
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,373
THAT'S WHERE THIS ROPE
COMES IN HANDY.

147
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:52,912
AND YOU JUST PULL DOWN ON THAT
AND THE CAR GOES UP.

148
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,353
THERE, NOW ALL I NEED IS...
SOMETHING TO PUT ON THE END

149
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,688
OF THE BOARD TO HOLD IT DOWN.

150
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,757
HERE, BOY, HERE, BOY,
COME ON, COME ON.

151
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,264
[grunting]

152
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,510
[car alarm sounding]

153
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,520
IT TOOK US A LITTLE
WHILE AND A WHOLE LOT OF EFFORT

154
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:37,457
TO GET ALL THESE CONCRETE
BLOCKS STACKED UP HERE,

155
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:40,626
BUT, YOU KNOW, HAROLD'S YOUNG.

156
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,562
HE'LL BE ABLE
TO STAND UP STRAIGHT

157
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,397
IN A FEW DAYS, I WOULD THINK.

158
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,898
[grunting]

159
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,400
THERE WE GO.

160
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,402
THAT SHOULD GET
HER UP HIGH ENOUGH,

161
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,737
TO BE ABLE TO GET RIGHT
AT THOSE TIRES.

162
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,372
[crashing]

163
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:59,345
UH...ALL RIGHT.

164
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:03,349
I JUST HAVE ONE WORD
FOR THIS: PERFECT.

165
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,519
NOW YOU WORK ON ALL FOUR
WHEELS AT ONCE.

166
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:09,355
ROTATE THE TIRES,
CHECK THE BRAKES, EH?

167
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:12,658
SERVICE THE MUFFLER,
PICK UP LOOSE CHANGE

168
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,393
THAT FELL OUT OF THE SEATS.

169
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,063
YUP, THIS IS A BRILLIANT
SYSTEM, EH?

170
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,365
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T MIND
A LITTLE WARPING

171
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,867
AND RIPPLING IN YOUR ROOF.

172
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,702
AND I'M SURE BUSTER WON'T.

173
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,204
AND REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

174
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,406
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

175
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,942
LET'S SEE THEM STEAL THIS ONE.

176
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,817
I'M TALKING TO OLDER
GUYS ABOUT SOMETHING

177
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,319
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU, THAT
YOU SOMETIMES TAKE FOR GRANTED,

178
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:44,557
THAT YOU RELY ON, THAT CAN
SUSTAIN YOU IN YOUR OLD AGE:

179
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,592
YOUR TOOLS.

180
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:51,898
NOW, WE DON'T ALWAYS TAKE THE
BEST CARE OF OUR TOOLS, DO WE?

181
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:54,400
SOMETIMES WE USE
THE WRONG TOOL FOR THE JOB,

182
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,135
LIKE THAT GARDEN HOE
THAT I MELTED

183
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,671
WHEN I CLEANED OUT
THE TRANSFORMER.

184
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,807
SOMETIMES WE LEAVE OUR TOOLS
OUT IN THE BAD WEATHER,

185
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,309
LIKE THAT RUSTY DRILL PRESS

186
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,912
THAT'S HOLDING UP
MY FRONT PORCH.

187
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:09,448
BUT YOU KNOW, UH, A TOOL
CAN BE A FRIEND,

188
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,551
D FRIENDSHIP
IN FACT IS A TOOL.

189
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:15,922
IT'S LIKE A RECIPROCATING SAW,
'CAUSE IT CUTS BOTH WAYS.

190
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:19,258
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS,
BUT I LIKE THE SOUND OF IT.

191
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:22,762
BUT I'M TELLING YOU,
IF YOUR TOOL IS A FRIEND,

192
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,664
YOU'LL HAVE A HAPPY LIFE.

193
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,633
IF YOUR FRIEND IS A TOOL,
YOU GOT A PROBLEM.

194
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,571
SO, YEAH.

195
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:37,443
SO, WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS,
YOU WANT TO PICK YOUR FRIENDS

196
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,178
THE SAME WAY
YOU PICK YOUR TOOLS.

197
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,748
YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR QUALITY,
RELIABILITY AND STRENGTH.

198
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,417
'CAUSE IF YOU TREAT
YOUR TOOLS RIGHT,

199
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,185
THEY'LL BE A FRIEND FOR LIFE.

200
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,287
BUT EVEN BETTER, TREAT
YOUR FRIENDS RIGHT,

201
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,523
YOU CAN BORROW THEIR TOOLS.

202
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,325
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

203
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,527
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

204
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,898
WELL...

205
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:03,970
WE'VE PROVEN THERE'S
SUCH A THING

206
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,238
AS EATING TOO MANY APRICOTS.

207
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,010
AND WE'VE PROVEN THERE'S
SUCH A THING AS EATING

208
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:14,580
WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY,
WAY TOO MANY APRICOTS.

209
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:20,886
BUT EVERY HOUR A COUPLE MORE
APRICOTS GO BAD.

210
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:25,358
AND WE'RE BARELY HALFWAY
THROUGH THE 400 CASES.

211
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:26,859
UNCLE RED, I GOT AN IDEA!

212
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,495
I GOT A GREAT IDEA.
WOULD YOU LIKE AN APRICOT?

213
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:30,997
OH...

214
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:32,732
'CAUSE I GOT THIS GREAT IDEA HOW

215
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,734
WE CAN USE THEM UP --
YOU KNOW WHAT?

216
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,403
WE CAN HAVE AN APRICOT
FESTIVAL, HA, HA.

217
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,904
THAT'D BE GREAT, YEAH, YEAH.

218
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,906
WE COULD HAVE, LIKE, BAKED
GOODS WITH APRICOTS.

219
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,341
WE COULD HAVE GAMES
WITH APRICOTS.

220
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,843
KIDS COULD HAVE GAMES, TOO.

221
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,544
THEY COULD PLAY, PIN

222
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,747
THE TAIL ON THE APRICOT, HUH?

223
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,382
AND APRICOT BATTING CAGES

224
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,951
AND APRICOT MILKSHAKES --
KIDS LOVE APRICOT MILKSHAKES.

225
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,452
AND WE COULD HAVE LIKE CROWNING

226
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,188
OF THE KING AND QUEEN
OF THE APRICOT FESTIVAL.

227
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,690
[laughing]

228
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,192
YEAH, THE PRIZE WOULD GO
TO A COUPLE WHOSE PERSONALITY

229
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,094
AND APPEARANCE MOST RESEMBLES
THAT OF AN APRICOT.

230
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,531
WOULDN'T THAT BE FUN?
THAT'D BE FUN, HUH?

231
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,333
FOR THE MEN, WE GET
APRICOT WRESTLING.

232
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,435
THEY'LL WRESTLE
WITH ALL THE APRICOTS.

233
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,437
THAT'D BE
FUN, RIGHT?
HAROLD...

234
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,640
YES?
DON'T SAY THE
WORD APRICOT.

235
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,943
AM I PRONOUNCING IT WRONG?

236
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,445
APRICOT, APRICOT, APRICOT...

237
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:23,315
APRICOT, APRICOT, APRICOT...

238
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:27,753
ALL RIGHT, MEN, AS YOU KNOW,
THIS IS A NEW MEMBER NIGHT.

239
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,488
MIKE HAMMER'S HERE,
AND MIKE, OF COURSE,

240
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:32,491
IS AN EX-CON WHO'S DONE SOME
HARD TIME AND REALLY DOESN'T

241
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:35,528
APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING IT UP
ALL THE TIME, SO BACK OFF.

242
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:37,029
ANYWAY, MIKE
HAS A GUY

243
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,531
THAT HE'D
LIKE TO PRESENT

244
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,032
AS A NEW MEMBER.

245
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,001
I THINK WE
CAN ALL GUESS

246
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,502
WHERE HE
MET HIM.

247
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,640
THANK YOU, MR. GREEN.

248
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,141
GENTLEMEN OF POSSUM LODGE.

249
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,343
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET
AN ASSOCIATE OF MINE,

250
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,245
BUGSY HAMMERHAND.

251
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:56,315
NOW, BUGSY'S COMING OFF
A STRING BAD LUCK.

252
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,351
NOT ONLY WAS HE WRONGFULLY
CONVICTED OF THEFT,

253
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,688
BUT HE WAS ALSO UNABLE
TO SELL ANY OF THE STUFF.

254
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:07,460
OH, AND HE CAN GET US STUFF THAT
WE NEED FROM TIME TO TIME, TOO.

255
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,462
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T
MIND, YOU KNOW,

256
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:12,398
GETTING USED STUFF THAT HAS
THE SERIAL NUMBER FILED OFF,

257
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:16,102
OR IN THE CASE OF CARS, SOME
DAMAGE TO THE STEERING COLUMN.

258
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:19,238
NOW, ANOTHER PERK
IF BUGSY JOINS

259
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,574
IS THAT IF ANYTHING GOES
MISSING AROUND HERE,

260
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,243
WE'LL PRETTY MUCH
KNOW WHO HAS IT, RIGHT?

261
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,080
SO I URGE YOU TO GO AGAINST
YOUR INSTINCTS AND THE ADVICE

262
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:31,550
OF THAT PAROLE BOARD AND LET
BUGSY JOIN POSSUM LODGE.

263
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,052
THANK YOU.

264
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,287
YEAH.

265
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:38,724
GUYS, ALL
THOSE IN FAVOUR?

266
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,530
UH, ANOTHER THING IS,
ONCE BUGSY IS A MEMBER,

267
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,032
WITH HIS RECORD, IF ANYTHING BAD
EVER HAPPENS AROUND HERE,

268
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,535
THE COPS ARE GOING
TO THINK IT WAS HIM

269
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,872
AND ARREST HIM INSTEAD OF YOU.

270
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,440
AYE!

271
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:55,941
ALL RIGHT.

272
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,510
CONGRATULATIONS, PARTNER.

273
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,446
YEAH, HI, BILL. SEE THE SIGN?

274
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:01,947
OH, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT, RED.

275
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,449
I GOT
AN IDEA. OW!

276
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:04,950
[moaning]

277
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,685
IT'S SAD. YOU GOT
ANY OTHER IDEAS?

278
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,454
THAT ONE, I THINK,
WAS NOT YOUR--

279
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,955
YOU'RE IN A FALLING ROCKS ZONE.

280
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:11,957
GOT AN IDEA.

281
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,459
NO, NO.

282
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,461
THAT WAS A BETTER IDEA.

283
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,630
WHAT'S THAT? I HOPE THAT'S ROPE.

284
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,566
OW, OW.

285
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:24,737
OH, OH, OH, MY GOSH, OH.

286
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,872
OH!

287
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,975
IT'S A FALLING ROCKS ZONE...

288
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,977
NO, I'M FINE.

289
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,113
DON'T THROW--

290
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,615
YOU MIGHT HAVE THROWN IT
A LITTLE HARD.

291
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:39,118
GRAB THE END OF THE...
GRAB THE END OF THE...

292
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,619
JUST WATCH IT.

293
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:44,156
GRAB THE END OF THE...THE...
THERE IT GOES.

294
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,091
SHE'S HOOKED ONTO
A LITTLE BRANCH UP THERE.

295
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:50,629
OH, OH,
I GOT AN IDEA.

296
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,431
I CLIMB UP AND
GRAB THE ROPE

297
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,166
AND PULL MYSELF
RIGHT TO THE TOP.

298
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,435
IT'LL BE GREAT,
YOU SEE?

299
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,271
FUNNY, THEY JUST KEEP
COMING, DON'T THEY?

300
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,273
ALL RIGHT, AWAY YOU GO.

301
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,109
I'M GLAD I DON'T GET ANY IDEAS.

302
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,278
I'M JUST GOING
TO WAIT HERE AND...

303
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,280
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.
I LIKE THAT SIGN.

304
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,316
THERE YOU GO, UP HE GOES.

305
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:12,051
SEE THE ROPE? THERE'S THE ROPE.

306
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,553
GRAB IT, JUST GRAB IT,
GRAB IT, GRAB IT.

307
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,055
AHA!

308
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,224
IT'S KIND OF THIN. CAREFUL.

309
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,096
OH.

310
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,565
THERE'S THE ROPE,
WHERE'S THE-- WHERE'S THE--

311
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,901
WHAT ABOUT THE BRANCH?

312
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,503
DID THE BRANCH STAY UP THERE?

313
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,808
THERE IT IS NOW.

314
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,476
ALL RIGHT. NO? NO GOOD?

315
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,645
GOT AN IDEA.

316
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,513
YEAH, WE'RE FINE,
WE'RE FINE, GOOD.

317
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,948
OK, A NOOSE.

318
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,450
WHOA.

319
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:45,951
WOW!

320
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:48,821
OH, MY GOSH.

321
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,424
THAT'S ONE OF THE BEST REVERSE
SHOTS I'VE EVER SEEN.

322
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,027
LET ME CHECK.
UGH, UGH, UGH.

323
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,329
WASN'T THAT-- SHE'S
NOT TOO SOLID, BILL.

324
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,165
SHE'S NOT TOO, UH, NOT
TOO, NOT TOO...OH, BOY.

325
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,667
WHAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE...

326
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,302
IT'S GOING TO PULL
THAT ROPE UP.

327
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,037
IT'S GOING TO PULL THE ROPE UP.

328
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,072
LOOK OUT. THE ROPE'S
GOING TO GO UP.

329
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,574
THE HOOK, THE HOOK, THE HOOK.

330
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,476
OH, BABY.

331
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:11,977
OH, NO.

332
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,213
OH, OH, OH.

333
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:17,783
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

334
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,285
UH-OH.

335
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,820
[thud]

336
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,461
HERE'S
MY PANTS.

337
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,963
YEAH.

338
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,499
CHANGE THIS TO...

339
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,167
YEAH, I THINK IT'S CLINTON.

340
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,178
OH, I GOT TO HAND IT TO HAROLD.

341
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:49,481
THAT APRICOT FESTIVAL
WAS A HUGE SUCCESS THERE.

342
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:53,619
WE RAISED A WHACK OF DOUGH,
DIDN'T WE, HAROLD?

343
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:56,188
[moaning]

344
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:57,756
HAROLD.

345
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,693
OH, I DON'T
FEEL GOOD.

346
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,263
MAYBE SOMETHING YOU ATE.

347
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,265
MRS. THOMSON'S APRICOT PIE
SURE HAD A FUNNY

348
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,567
TASTE TO IT -- WHAT WAS THAT?

349
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:12,371
I THINK SHE USED
THE WRONG KIND OF ONIONS.

350
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:16,208
BUT ANYWAY, WE RAISED
OVER $200 ON THE DAY.

351
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,710
[knocking]

352
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,211
SEE WHO THAT IS, WILL YOU?

353
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,713
YEAH.

354
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,715
IT'S NOT VERY OFTEN
AT THE LODGE HERE...

355
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,718
WE ATE AS MANY APRICOTS AS YOU'D
EVER WANT AND THEN SOME,

356
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,720
AND WE STILL RAISED
A WHACK OF DOUGH.

357
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,722
IT WAS A WIN-WIN ALL THE WAY,

358
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:33,325
WHERE RARELY AT THE LODGE WE GET
SOMETHING THAT JUST WORKS OUT...

359
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,827
WE SINNED, WE SINNED, WE SINNED.

360
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,329
I SAID WE SINNED, AND YOU
WOULDN'T LISTEN. WE SINNED...

361
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:38,831
WHAT?

362
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,766
WAS THERE SOMEBODY LOOKING
FOR APRICOTS THERE, HAROLD?

363
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,267
YEAH, OH, YEAH.

364
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,769
IT'S THE TRUCK DRIVER.

365
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,270
HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

366
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,772
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

367
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,273
HE'S GOT A CLENCHED FIST.

368
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,275
AND HE'S NOT JUST
A TRUCK DRIVER, EITHER.

369
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:53,812
HE'S ALSO THE LOCAL
PRODUCE INSPECTOR.

370
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,314
YEAH, HE SAID THOSE APRICOTS

371
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:58,183
WERE UNFIT
FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION.

372
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,186
HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO THE
HAZARDOUS WASTE DUMPSITE,

373
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,122
WHEN HE GOT IN THE ACCIDENT.

374
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,562
ALL RIGHT, WELL...
I'LL TALK TO HIM IN A MINUTE.

375
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,464
WHERE ARE
YOU GOING?
HOSPITAL.

376
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:16,535
I'M GOING TO HAVE
MY APRICOTS REMOVED.

377
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,409
WELCOME TO THE
EXPERT PORTION OF THE SHOW.

378
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,711
IT'S THE PART OF THE SHOW
WHERE WE EXAMINE

379
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,213
THOSE THREE WORDS
THAT MEN FIND SO HARD TO SAY.

380
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,215
I DON'T KNOW.

381
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,718
THAT'S A TRUISM,
ISN'T IT? ALL RIGHTY.

382
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,721
JOINING ME AND UNCLE RED IN
THE EXPERT PORTION OF THE SHOW

383
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,357
TODAY IS MOTHER NATURE'S
BOYFRIEND HIMSELF, RANGER GORD.

384
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:47,733
HELLO, EVERYONE.

385
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,537
IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK IN THE
REAL WORLD...OR EVEN HERE.

386
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,539
OK, OUR LETTER GOES LIKE THIS.

387
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,040
IT'S ADDRESSED TO OUR EXPERTS.

388
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:58,043
IT SAYS: "DEAR EXPERTS,
HOW ARE YOU?"

389
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,045
I'M A LITTLE UPSET
TODAY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

390
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:03,048
BECAUSE I LOST MY FAVOURITE PAIR
OF SUNGLASSES, BUT YOU KNOW,

391
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,551
IT'S NOT THE END
OF THE WORLD, NO WAY.

392
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:08,187
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN

393
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,788
UNTIL THE YEAR 2015.

394
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:13,425
IT'S IN NOVEMBER, ON A THURSDAY,
AND IT'S AFTER LUNCH, OK?

395
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,427
DON'T GET TOO UPSET
WHEN YOU LOSE SOMETHING.

396
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,097
YOU MUST REMEMBER TO REPLACE
THE THING THAT YOU LOST,

397
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:20,165
WITH SOMETHING NEW.

398
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,668
AND THE REAL TRICKY PART IS
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER

399
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,170
TO REPLACE THE SAME THING
WITH THE SAME THING.

400
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,672
IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU CAN'T REPLACE

401
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:30,175
AN OLD PAIR OF SUNGLASSES
BY BUYING A NEW WAFFLE IRON, OK?

402
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:38,884
EXCUSE ME, I THINK A FUSE BLEW.

403
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:41,820
OH, NO, IT'S OK.

404
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,388
SOMEONE'S GOT IT.

405
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,367
OUR LETTER CONTINUES:

406
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:00,739
"I WAS HOPING YOU COULD
ANALYSE A DREAM FOR ME."

407
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,675
"I HAVE THIS RECURRING DREAM
THAT I'M RANGER GORD."

408
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,177
REALLY?

409
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,179
THAT IS VERY WEIRD,
BECAUSE SOMETIMES

410
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:10,549
I HAVE THAT EXACT SAME DREAM.

411
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,152
YOU, YOU, YOU DREAM
YOU'RE RANGER GORD?

412
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:17,189
YEAH, SOMETIMES.

413
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:20,192
ARE YOU SURE IT'S A DREAM,
RANGER GORD, BECAUSE YOU HAVE

414
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:26,398
TO REALIZE THAT...
YOU'RE RANGER GORD.

415
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,400
WELL, I MEAN I THINK
IT'S A DREAM.

416
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,336
IT STARTS OFF WITH THESE TWO
REALLY FOXY-LOOKING WOMEN.

417
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:34,239
SSS, OOOH, BABY.

418
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,874
THEY'RE LOOKING AT ME, SMILING,

419
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,544
AND THEY START WALKING
RIGHT TOWARDS ME.

420
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,179
OH, THIS IS DEFINITELY A DREAM.

421
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,650
I'VE HAD THAT DREAM.
I KNOW THAT DREAM.

422
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,151
I'M HAVING THAT DREAM RIGHT NOW.

423
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,719
REALLY?

424
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,388
YES, IT'S A GOOD DREAM.

425
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:50,889
OHHH...

426
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,391
[chuckling]

427
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:55,160
THEY PUT ON SNOWMOBILE SUITS

428
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,729
AND DO THE MACARENA
FOR 4 1/2 HOURS.

429
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,264
OOOH, BABY.

430
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,133
[chuckling]

431
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:10,242
IT'S A LITTLE
DIFFERENT THAN MINE.

432
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,979
WELL, AT LEAST HE'S NOT
HAVING NIGHTMARES.

433
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,481
OH, NO, WITH RANGER GORD,
THE SCARY PART DOESN'T START

434
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,217
TILL HE WAKES UP.

435
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:30,762
THIS GOVERNMENT HAS TO STOP
CUTTING FUNDING TO HOSPITALS.

436
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,899
300 HUNDRED GUYS AND
ONLY ONE STOMACH PUMP.

437
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,069
LOT OF THE GUYS
DIDN'T EVEN WAIT

438
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:40,205
WAIT FOR
THE PUMP.

439
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,741
MOOSE THOMPSON WAS IN THERE
FOR OVER AN HOUR.

440
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,243
YEAH, THEY SHOULD HAVE SWITCHED

441
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,245
TO THE FIRE HOSE
FOR HIM, I THINK.

442
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,247
BUT, YOU KNOW, HEY,
THERE'S GOOD NEWS HERE.

443
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:51,216
AND THERE WAS NO LONG-TERM
ILL-EFFECTS ON ANYBODY.

444
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,218
EVEN THE TRUCK DRIVER
IS OFF THE HOOK,

445
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,120
BECAUSE WE PROCESSED
ALL THE BAD APRICOTS

446
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:56,622
WITH OUR OWN DIGESTIVE SYSTEMS.

447
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,123
YEAH, WE STILL
HAVE THE PROFITS

448
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,125
FROM THE
FESTIVAL.

449
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,727
YEAH, THAT'LL HELP PAY
THE FINES.

450
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,262
FINES,
WHAT FINES?

451
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:04,930
WELL, THERE WAS

452
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:08,033
THEFT AND LITTERING,
AND SOMEBODY PARKED

453
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,369
MY VAN IN THE AMBULANCE SPOT.

454
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,137
[squealing]

455
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,639
MEETING TIME.

456
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,641
UM, YOU GO AHEAD, HAROLD.
I'LL BE DOWN.

457
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:18,143
TAKE IT EASY,
I'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.

458
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,811
AH, GIVE
ME A PUSH.

459
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:23,649
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING.

460
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,651
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT
HOME AFTER THE MEETING.

461
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,819
AND I LEARNED A VERY
VALUABLE LESSON THIS WEEK.

462
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,555
FRUIT KILLS.

463
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,091
FOR THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

464
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:36,094
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND HAROLD
AND THE WHOLE GANG UP HERE

465
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:39,131
AT POSSUM LODGE, KEEP YOUR
