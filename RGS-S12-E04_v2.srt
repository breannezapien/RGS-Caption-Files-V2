THEY EVEN HAVE A
DETACHABLE FACE PLATE

SO THE SUCKER WHO STEALS YOUR
CAR CAN'T EVEN ENJOY THAT.

STEAL YOUR CAR AT ALL?

ELIMINATED THE RISK

THE DRIVER AND THE PASSENGER

DUAL CONTROLS TO YOUR CAR

SO YOU CAN DRIVE
FROM THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE.

THAT WAY YOU CAN BE THE

NEVER HAS TO ORDER THE LUNCH

OKAY, I'VE GOT MY SECOND
STEERING WHEEL IN PLACE HERE.

176

TO THE REAL STEERING WHEEL.

YOU MIGHT WANT TO
GET THEM OUT OF THE ROOM.

190
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:18,950
OKAY, NOW, THE HOCKEY
STICKS ARE PERFECT FOR THIS

191
00:10:19,017 --> 00:10:21,553
BECAUSE THE BLADE IS STRONG,
AND IT'S SHAPED LIKE A PEDAL.

192
00:10:21,586 --> 00:10:24,489
SO NOW ALL I GOTTA
DO IS ATTACH THESE TO
THE FLOOR OF MY VEHICLE.

IS GONNA ACTIVATE THE
FAKE FEET ON THE REAL PEDAL.

195

NOW, IF YOUR VEHICLE HAS THE
FLOOR COMPLETELY ROUNDED
OUT OF HER,

196
00:10:33,164 --> 00:10:36,668
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO ABANDON

NO REAL SET RULE ON THAT,

BECAUSE EVERY CAR IS
DIFFERENT, OF COURSE.

00:10:54,552 --> 00:10:56,487
SO YOU PRETTY MUCH HAVE TO
USE YOUR OWN BRAIN POWER.

YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET SOME
EDUCATION AND TRAINING.

221
00:12:06,457 --> 00:12:08,993
I SUGGEST THE
CORRESPONDENCE SCHOOLS

222
00:12:09,026 --> 00:12:11,462
BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING YOU
CAN DO IN YOUR OWN HOME,

IN YOUR OWN PACE,
IN YOUR OWN UNDERWEAR.

224

YOU CAN EVEN PLAY HOOKY BY
MAILING IN AN EMPTY ENVELOPE.

225
00:12:18,703 --> 00:12:21,739
BUT, SEE, AT THE
CORRESPONDENCE SCHOOLS
YOU CAN LEARN A TRADE,

226
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:24,275
BECAUSE YOU WANNA
BE CERTIFIED IN SOMETHING.

227
00:12:24,342 --> 00:12:27,912
BEING CERTIFIABLE
IS REAL IMPORTANT IN
THE BUSINESS WORLD.

228
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:31,382
YEAH, BECAUSE IF YOU'VE
GOT A CERTIFICATE,

229
00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:33,351
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU
DON'T HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE

OR EVEN ANY IDEA WHAT IT IS
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO,

231

TO BLAME IT ON

FRIES WITH THAT.

SOME TRAINING.

AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK OUT,

306
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,949
WALTER'S GOT A
PRETTY GOOD ARM,

307
00:15:51,982 --> 00:15:55,052
BUT IT'S NOT
CONNECTED TO ANYTHING.

308
00:15:55,118 --> 00:15:58,589
AND HE KNOCKS
THE BIG NEST -- OH!

309
00:15:58,655 --> 00:16:01,391
AND THEN THE -- OH!

310
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,394
THEN THE NEXT COME
DOWN OUT OF THE TREE.

311
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:06,964
NOW, WALTER HAD AN UNU --
HE THOUGHT THIS WAS

312
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:11,168
SOME KIND OF TRANSCENDENTAL
RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE.

313
00:16:11,234 --> 00:16:14,571
IT'S NOT THE
MAHARISHI HUMPHREY.

314
00:16:14,638 --> 00:16:16,907
THEN A BIG BIRD --
OKAY, I SEE.

315
00:16:16,974 --> 00:16:19,109
WE'RE MESSING AROUND WITH A
PRETTY BIG BIRD'S NEST.

316
00:16:19,176 --> 00:16:22,012
I THINK THE BEST THING,
GET THE NEXT BACK UP
INTO THE TREE.

317
00:16:22,045 --> 00:16:24,114
WE DON'T -- LET'S NOT WORRY
ABOUT THE KITE RIGHT NOW.

318
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:26,917
SO DALTON AND I CAME OVER
TO GIVE HIM A BOOST UP.

319
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,419
NEVER SURE HOW YOU
DO THAT WITH THE ARMS.

320
00:16:29,486 --> 00:16:31,521
LIKE YOU HOLD ONE WRIST --
AND WE GOT INTO A --

321
00:16:31,555 --> 00:16:33,790
WE HAD A BIT OF
AN ARGUMENT.

322
00:16:33,857 --> 00:16:37,794
LUCKILY, THE POSSUM LODGE
OATH COMES IN REAL
HANDY THERE.

323
00:16:37,861 --> 00:16:39,896
THEN WALTER COULD JUST --

324
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,198
YOU WANNA GET UP THERE.

325
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:42,866
JUST GET THE NEST
BACK IN PLACE,

326
00:16:45,469 --> 00:16:47,571
WALTER, GET THE KITE
WHILE YOU'RE UP THERE.

327
00:16:47,637 --> 00:16:49,806
BUT THE BIRD STARTS
COMING BACK

328
00:16:49,873 --> 00:16:51,641
AND DOESN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND
WHAT WE'RE DOING,

329
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:56,413
AND THEN -- OKAY, WE HAD
NO PLAN FOR THIS.

330
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,349
BOY, THEY GET A LOT OF
LIFT OUT OF THOSE WINGS.

331
00:16:59,382 --> 00:17:01,151
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY HAVE
A CRANE OR SOMETHING.

332
00:17:01,218 --> 00:17:02,652
MAYBE THAT IS A
CRANE, THAT BIRD.

333
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,888
AND THEN HE
DROPPED THE NEST.

334
00:17:04,955 --> 00:17:06,556
THERE, WALTER'S GOT THE NEST
RIGHT BACK IN PLACE.

335
00:17:06,623 --> 00:17:08,024
PERFECT.
BIRD'S GOTTA BE HAPPY NOW.

336
00:17:08,058 --> 00:17:09,292
THE BIRD'S HAPPY.
WE'RE HAPPY.

337
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,260
NICE JOB.
NICE JOB, WALTER.

338
00:17:10,327 --> 00:17:11,728
TAKE A BOW.
TAKE A BOW.

339
00:17:11,795 --> 00:17:13,396
AND THE BIRD
I GUESS IS HAPPY

340
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,565
BECAUSE IT DROPPED WALTER.

341
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,734
WE GOT YOU
OH, NO. OH, NO.

342
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:19,636
I GUESS THE WIND
TOOK HIM THERE.

343
00:17:19,703 --> 00:17:22,239
BUT HE'S OUT IN THE -- WHAT
WE FIND AROUND THE LODGE

344
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:24,574
IS IF YOU GIVE TO NATURE,
NATURE WILL GIVE BACK TO YOU.

345
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:28,111
SO WE GAVE WALTER
A SORE BACK,

346
00:17:28,145 --> 00:17:29,846
AND WE GAVE THE
BIRD THE NEST,

347
00:17:29,913 --> 00:17:31,848
AND THE BIRD GAVE
US THE KITE.

348
00:17:31,915 --> 00:17:33,917

[ APPLAUSE ]

350

YOU KNOW, WHEN THE
WEATHER WARMS UP,

351
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,729
A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO HANG
THEIR LAUNDRY OUTSIDE.

352
00:17:45,762 --> 00:17:47,130
IT'S CHEAPER THAN
USING THE DRYER,

353
00:17:47,197 --> 00:17:49,399
AND IT'S A REAL NICE WAY TO
BLOCK OUT THAT RUSTY K-CAR

354
00:17:49,466 --> 00:17:52,435
YOU'VE HAD UP ON
BLOCKS SINCE 1985.

355
00:17:52,469 --> 00:17:55,238
THE PROBLEM WITH MOST
CLOTHES LINES IS THE
WORK INVOLVED.

356
00:17:55,272 --> 00:17:57,574
YOU EITHER HAVE TO WALK THE
LENGTH OF HER AS YOU GO,

357
00:17:57,607 --> 00:17:59,943
OR YOU GOTTA HORSE THE
LINE AROUND THE PULLEYS.

358
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:01,678
WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF YOU
COULD MOVE YOUR CLOTHES LINE

359
00:18:01,745 --> 00:18:03,546
WITH JUST A TOUCH
OF A BUTTON?

360
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,148
WELL, YEAH.

361
00:18:05,215 --> 00:18:07,217
ALL IT TAKES
IS A LITTLE CREATIVITY

362
00:18:07,284 --> 00:18:09,419
AND YOUR TRUSTY
BETAMAX VCR.

363
00:18:11,955 --> 00:18:14,724
MAKE THAT YOUR DUSTY
BETAMAX VCR.

364
00:18:16,826 --> 00:18:18,862
OKAY, I JUST STUCK
AN OLD TAPE IN THERE

365
00:18:18,928 --> 00:18:20,964
AND I WOUND THE OTHER END
AROUND MY FAR PULLEY

366
00:18:20,997 --> 00:18:23,233
SO I COULD USE
IT AS A CLOTHES LINE.

367
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:25,368
AND YES, YOU COULD
DO THIS WITH A VHS,

368
00:18:25,402 --> 00:18:28,405
BUT EVERYBODY KNOWS
BETA'S A LOT BETTER, EH?

369
00:18:28,438 --> 00:18:30,306
AND YOU CAN USE
ANY TAPE YOU WANT.

370
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,843
I THOUGHT GONE WITH
THE WIND WAS A GOOD CHOICE.

371
00:18:33,877 --> 00:18:35,345
NOW, TO MOVE MY
CLOTHES OUT,

372
00:18:35,378 --> 00:18:36,846
ALL I DO IS PRESS FORWARD.

373
00:18:39,582 --> 00:18:40,984
AND WHEN I WANT THE
CLOTHES TO COME BACK,

374
00:18:41,017 --> 00:18:42,285
I JUST HIT REWIND.

375

TO DRY IN A HURRY,
