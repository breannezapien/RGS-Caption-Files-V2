00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:54,793
ALL RIGHT YOU CAN HAVE A

172
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:55,995
HECK OF A TIME WITH THIS

173
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,764
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN,

174
00:04:58,764 --> 00:04:59,832
YOU KNOW THIS BRINGS BACK

175
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:00,699
I THINK THIS BRINGS BACK.

176
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:01,667
NOW APPEARANCES CAN

177
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:03,869
BE DECEIVING, THIS IS NOT

178
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:05,371
JUST AN OLD CRAPPY STEPLADDER,

179
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,038
A WAD OF DUCT TAPE

180
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:06,939
AND AN OLD DRILL,

181
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:07,740
THIS HAPPENS TO BE A HIGH

182
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,810
PRECISION VERTICAL DRILL PRESS.

183
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:18,050
(DRILL BUZZING)

184
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,618
>>RED: BEAUTIFUL, OR YOU COULD

185
00:05:19,618 --> 00:05:21,720
USE THIS SECTION UP IN HERE

186
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,522
TO SAY CRACK WALNUTS,

187
00:05:23,522 --> 00:05:25,090
LOBSTER CLAWS OR EVEN BREAK

188
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,492
THE FOOTBALL HELMET OFF

189
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,895
THE FAT KID.

190
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:30,696
OR IF YOU GOT A STEPLADDER

191
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:31,497
AND SAY YOU GOT A SON WHO'S GOT

192
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,032
A COUPLE OF BUNGEE CORDS ON

193
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,300
HIS BIKE RACK, YOU HOOK THE

194
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,735
BUNGEE CORDS UP AND YOU GOT

195
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:38,437
YOURSELF ONE OF THEM EXERCISER

196
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:40,739
THIGHMASTER BIKES.

197
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:43,208
NOT ADVISED FOR ANYBODY

198
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,476
WITH A BIG NOSE OR OTHER

199
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:45,844
OF THE LARGER OPTIONS.

200
00:05:45,844 --> 00:05:46,812
NOW HERE'S SOMETHING ELSE

201
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:50,582
YOU CAN USE, A PORTABLE PEN,

202
00:05:50,582 --> 00:05:51,517
YOU JUST TAKE THE STEPLADDER

203
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,518
LIKE THIS AND PUT HER UP AGAINST

204
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,986
A WALL OR A FENCE AND YOU CAN

205
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,922
PUT YOUR KID IN THERE OR A DOG

206
00:05:56,922 --> 00:05:57,689
OR A STRAY CATTLE OR WHAT

207
00:05:57,689 --> 00:05:58,590
HAVE YOU, THEY'RE NOT GOING

208
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,526
TO GO ANY WHERE.

209
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,727
ANOTHER INTERESTING USE

210
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,728
OF A STEPLADDER IS FLIP HER

211
00:06:02,728 --> 00:06:03,629
UPSIDE DOWN, IT WILL HELP

212
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:04,663
YOU PUT THE DRYWALL ON

213
00:06:04,663 --> 00:06:05,731
YOUR CEILING.

214
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:09,234
YOU MOUNT THE WHOLE THING

215
00:06:09,234 --> 00:06:10,536
LIKE THAT, PUT YOUR DRYWALL UP

216
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,603
ON TOP OF THE 4 LEGS

217
00:06:11,603 --> 00:06:14,506
INVERTED LIKE SO.

218
00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:18,010
NOW YOU PUT THE WHOLE RIG

219
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,912
ONTO A HYDRAULIC JACK OR

220
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:20,779
MOOSE THOMPSON, WHATEVER

221
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:22,881
IS HANDIER AND THEN YOU JUST

222
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:24,183
JACK THE WHOLE THING UP,

223
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,384
UP AGAINST THE CEILING,

224
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,251
AND THEN GO GET YOURSELF

225
00:06:26,251 --> 00:06:27,519
ANOTHER LADDER AND CARRY

226
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,420
YOUR VERTICAL DRILL PRESS UP

227
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,454
WITH YOU AND YOU CAN SCREW THE

228
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:30,522
DRYWALL RIGHT INTO THE CEILING,

229
00:06:30,522 --> 00:06:36,595
IT'S JUST THAT EASY.

230
00:06:36,595 --> 00:06:38,297
OF COURSE NOW THE BEST USE OF

231
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:39,965
THE STEPLADDER IS A LADDER

232
00:06:39,965 --> 00:06:41,633
THAT SAVES YOU STEPS,

233
00:06:41,633 --> 00:06:42,401
SO LET'S SAY YOU GOT TO

234
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,602
GO SOMEWHERE REAL HIGH

235
00:06:43,602 --> 00:06:44,503
AND YOU WANT TO HAVE A REAL

236
00:06:44,503 --> 00:06:45,470
BIG LADDER, WELL YOU DON'T

237
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,238
NEED A REAL BIG LADDER,

238
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:47,172
ALL YOU NEED IS

239
00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:48,540
MORE STEPLADDERS.

240
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,576
SO YOU TAKE YOUR 2 STEPLADDERS,

241
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,643
YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER,

242
00:06:51,643 --> 00:06:52,945
PUT AN EXTRA BOARD ON THE TOP

243
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,346
TO GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT

244
00:06:54,346 --> 00:06:55,113
OF EXTRA WIDTH.

245
00:06:55,113 --> 00:06:56,548
TAKE YOUR THIRD LADDER,

246
00:06:56,548 --> 00:06:57,683
PUT THAT UP ALONGSIDE

247
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:00,185
THE OTHER TOO.

248
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:16,134
(GROANING & GROWLING)

249
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:30,515
AND THAT'S A LOT EASIER

250
00:07:30,515 --> 00:07:33,351
THAN GETTING A BIG LADDER.

251
00:07:33,351 --> 00:07:35,253
AND I THINK THIS IS WHAT

252
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:36,421
MICHELANGELO USED WHEN HE

253
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:38,990
DID THE SISTINE CHAPEL.

254
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:39,991
NOW YOU'RE UP TWICE AS HIGH,

255
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:41,359
IF YOU WANT TO GO UP 3 TIMES

256
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:43,528
AS HIGH YOU'D NEED 3 LADDERS

257
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:47,099
AND I GUESS ABOUT 30 LADDERS.

258
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,434
OH 6, OKAY 6, 6 LADDERS,

259
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:50,168
IF YOU WANT TO GO UP 4 TIMES

260
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:53,138
AS HIGH YOU'D NEED 5...

261
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:54,906
YOU'D NEED SCAFFOLDING.

262
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:55,740
WELL OKAY, WELL I GUESS

263
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,741
THAT'S ABOUT IT FOR

264
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:57,876
A STEPLADDER.

265
00:07:57,876 --> 00:07:58,743
SO UNTIL THE NEXT TIME REMEMBER

266
00:07:58,743 --> 00:07:59,811
IF THE WOMEN DON'T FIND

267
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:00,745
YOU HANDSOME, THEY SHOULD

268
00:08:00,745 --> 00:08:03,648
AT LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

269
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:04,683
TIME TO HIT THE WILD,

270
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:08,954
BLUE YONDER, OH BOY!

271
00:08:08,954 --> 00:08:09,621
IT'S A LITTLE SHAKY

272
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:10,889
BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT,

273
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:11,756
OH MY, I DON'T,

274
00:08:11,756 --> 00:08:16,328
OH, OH, OH, UH OH, GRAVITY.

275
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:19,064
(LOUD CRASHING)

276
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,635
>>HAROLD: AND NOW IT'S FOR

277
00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:24,536
THAT PART OF THE SHOW WHERE WE

278
00:08:24,536 --> 00:08:25,437
EXPOSE THE 3 LITTLE WORDS

279
00:08:25,437 --> 00:08:26,271
THAT MEN JUST FIND IT SO

280
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:27,239
DIFFICULT TO SAY,

281
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:29,074
'I DON'T KNOW'.

282
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:30,308
AND HERE ARE MY GUESTS

283
00:08:30,308 --> 00:08:31,309
ON 'THE EXPERTS' SEGMENT TODAY,

284
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:32,510
OF COURSE MY UNCLE RED

285
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:44,089
AND HAP SHAUGHNESSY.

286
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:45,590
LETTER NUMBER ONE,

287
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,725
'DEAR EXPERTS, ALTHOUGH

288
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:47,892
I HAVE A DEGREE IN BOTH

289
00:08:47,892 --> 00:08:49,561
ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE

290
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:50,462
AND HAVE WON MANY FRIENDLY

291
00:08:50,462 --> 00:08:51,496
GAMES OF 'I'M WAY SMARTER

292

THAN YOU ARE',

293
00:08:52,964 --> 00:08:53,865
I HAVE NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD

294
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:55,400
HOW COMPUTERS WORK,

295
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:01,039
CAN YOU EXPLAIN?'

296
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:03,208
>>RED: HAP?

297
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:07,912
>>HAP: NO GO AHEAD.

298
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:08,880
>>RED: WELL, WELL COMPUTERS

299
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,181
ARE A VERY SIMPLE THING.

300
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:11,983
>>HAP: YEAH THERE'S

301
00:09:11,983 --> 00:09:13,184
NOTHING TO IT.

302
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:14,085
>>RED: YEAH MAINLY YOU HAVE

303
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:15,420
YOUR COMPUTER PROGRAMS WHICH

304
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,589
ARE ON THE DISCS AND THE DISCS

305
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:18,790
GO INTO THE COMPUTER AND

306
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,058
THEY'RE SPUN AROUND THERE

307
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:24,229
BY A TYPE OF ELECTRIC DRILL,

308
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:25,663
AND THAT'S FLYING AROUND IN

309
00:09:25,663 --> 00:09:27,966
THERE SO THAT YOUR SOFTWARE

310
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:30,268
HIGH DENSITY DATABASE UNITS

311
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:32,070
COME SPINNING RIGHT OFF THE DISC

312
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,204
AND RAM RIGHT UP AGAINST YOUR

313
00:09:33,204 --> 00:09:36,341
TV SCREEN AND THAT ALLOWS YOU

314
00:09:36,341 --> 00:09:38,476
TO PRINT STUFF OFF AND YOU CAN

315
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:40,178
GET GRAPHS WHICH WILL SHOW YOU

316
00:09:40,178 --> 00:09:41,112
EXACTLY HOW MUCH MONEY YOU'RE

317
00:09:41,112 --> 00:09:45,784
GOING TO LOSE NEXT YEAR.

318
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:46,618
>>HAP: NOW I BETTER CLARIFY

319
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:49,154
THAT A BIT I THINK.

320
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:50,088
BUT TO DO THAT I'D HAVE TO

321
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:51,256
GO BACK AS FAR AS THE OLD

322
00:09:51,256 --> 00:09:52,624
MORSE CODE THAT I USED DURING

323
00:09:52,624 --> 00:09:56,127
W.W.II WHEN I HAD TO LET MY

324
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:58,229
SQUAD KNOW THAT I CAPTURED

325
00:09:58,229 --> 00:10:00,231
THIS ENEMY BATTALION SINGLE

326
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:02,333
HANDEDLY AND THAT I HAD

327
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,468
TO DECLINE THE MEDAL BECAUSE

328
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:04,302
THERE WASN'T ENOUGH ROOM LEFT

329
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:07,038
ON THE TUNIC ANY MORE,

330
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:08,006
IT WAS DISAPPEARING

331
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:09,374
OVER THE SHOULDER.

332
00:10:09,374 --> 00:10:11,242
BUT WHERE MORSE CODE WAS DOTS

333
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:12,677
AND DASHES, COMPUTERS ARE

334
00:10:12,677 --> 00:10:15,013
ONES AND ZEROS OR BITS AND

335
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:21,886
BYTES OR I'S AND BM'S.

336
00:10:21,886 --> 00:10:23,788
AND THEY GOT THIS LITTLE

337
00:10:23,788 --> 00:10:25,990
JAPANESE ROBOT INSIDE THE

338

A KIND OF A BIOSPHERE THING UP

370
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:27,251
AT THE LODGE AND I THOUGHT MAYBE

371
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:28,052
YOU COULD GIVE US A FEW TIPS

372
00:11:28,052 --> 00:11:29,120
ON YOU KNOW HOW TO

373
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,722
LIVE IN ISOLATION.

374
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:32,723
>>GORD: OH YEAH.

375
00:11:32,723 --> 00:11:36,160
OH YEAH, YEAH WELL YOU KNOW

376
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,229
THE THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT

377
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:40,264
MIND AND BODY AREN'T SEPARATE,

378
00:11:40,264 --> 00:11:41,132
SO YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE TO

379
00:11:41,132 --> 00:11:42,366
HIT YOUR HEAD REALLY, REALLY

380
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:44,702
HARD AGAINST A TREE OR A

381

SO YOU KNOW YOU MUST,

387
00:11:57,315 --> 00:11:58,049

390
00:12:05,623 --> 00:12:06,591

00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:12,910
HOCKEY STICKS AND CANVAS,

507
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,844
GOT A BICYCLE RIM,

508
00:15:13,844 --> 00:15:17,614
GOT AN OLD PUMP OFF THE

509
00:15:17,614 --> 00:15:18,348
FARM THERE AND I'D PUT THAT,

510
00:15:18,348 --> 00:15:19,416
THAT'LL BE FINE I GUESS.

511
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,451
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE HAD

512
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:22,085
IN MIND, SO HE'S TRYING TO,

513
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:23,387
NO BILL YOU'RE BREAKING IT,

514
00:15:23,387 --> 00:15:24,388
OH I SEE, OKAY, HE'S BREAKING IT

00:15:24,388 --> 00:15:25,556
ILLEGAL CURVE I GUESS

00:15:25,556 --> 00:15:26,957
ON THAT ONE.

517
00:15:26,957 --> 00:15:28,025
AND THEN HE WANTED ME TO

518
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:28,892
HOLD THAT AND I SAID, NO,

519
00:15:28,892 --> 00:15:31,061

521
00:15:32,296 --> 00:15:34,364
BETTER IDEA, I'LL HOLD THE,

522
00:15:34,364 --> 00:15:36,233
I'D RATHER BE A HAMMER THAN

523
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:37,201
A GARFUNKEL AND THEN HE WRAPPED

524
00:15:37,201 --> 00:15:39,503
THE CANVAS AROUND THE HOCKEY

525
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:40,904
STICKS AND DUCT TAPED AND THEN

526
00:15:40,904 --> 00:15:42,172
ONE HOCKEY STICK WENT UP HIGH

527
00:15:42,172 --> 00:15:43,507
AND THEN WE PUT THE SPRINKLER

528
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:44,775
ON THERE, I'M STARTING TO GET

529
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:45,709
AN IDEA NOW, THE HOSE IS HOOKED

530
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:46,844

531
00:15:46,844 --> 00:15:47,845

00:15:47,845 --> 00:15:48,779
TO IS THAT WHATEVER'S IN THE

533
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:49,680

YOU GOT TO HAVE WATER GOING

541
00:15:58,755 --> 00:15:59,690
INTO THE PUMP BEFORE YOU CAN

542
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,724
HAVE WATER COMING OUT OF

543
00:16:00,724 --> 00:16:01,858
THE PUMP, BUT HERE AGAIN THE

544
00:16:01,858 --> 00:16:02,926
OLD SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON

559
00:16:23,614 --> 00:16:24,681

560
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:27,384

561
00:16:27,384 --> 00:16:29,019

562
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:31,221

ON THE OLD JOHN DEERE,

568
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:44,568
NOTHING TAKES OFF LIKE A DEER.

569
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:45,502

IT'S GOING TO PUMP THE WATER

579
00:16:57,114 --> 00:16:58,648

580
00:16:58,648 --> 00:16:59,483

00:19:02,372 --> 00:19:03,206
YOU HANDSOME, AT LEAST THEY

656
00:19:03,206 --> 00:19:04,107
SHOULD ASK YOU TO DO

657
00:19:04,107 --> 00:19:05,975
THEIR HOMEWORK FOR THEM.

658
00:19:09,345 --> 00:19:10,447

AND EMBARRASS YOUR PARENTS

662

A NORMAL PART OF GROWING UP

664
00:19:16,786 --> 00:19:18,054
WHEREAS GETTING A

00:19:18,054 --> 00:19:19,656
TATTOO IS STUPID.

666
00:19:19,656 --> 00:19:20,890
A TATTOO IS BASICALLY

667
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,959
A LIQUID SLIVER AND A

668
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:24,828
LIQUID IS PERMANENT INK.

669
00:19:24,828 --> 00:19:25,628
GETTING A TATTOO IS KIND

670
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:26,663
OF LIKE SUCKING ON A PEN

671
00:19:26,663 --> 00:19:29,465
WITH YOUR WHOLE BODY,

672
00:19:29,465 --> 00:19:31,334
AND IT'S PAINFUL.

673
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:32,168
THERE'S ONLY 2 THINGS MORE

674
00:19:32,168 --> 00:19:33,036
PAINFUL THAN GETTING A TATTOO,

675
00:19:33,036 --> 00:19:33,770
THE FIRST ONE BEING GETTING

676
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:34,704
2 TATTOOS AND THE SECOND ONE

677
00:19:34,704 --> 00:19:35,538
IS GETTING EITHER ONE OF

678
00:19:35,538 --> 00:19:37,674
THEM REMOVED.

679
00:19:37,674 --> 00:19:38,508
NOW I KNOW THERE MIGHT BE

680
00:19:38,508 --> 00:19:39,676
SOME APPEAL IN HAVING GUNS

681
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:41,778
AND ROSES TATTOOED ON YOUR BUTT,

682
00:19:41,778 --> 00:19:42,845
BUT 60 YEARS FROM NOW IN

683
00:19:42,845 --> 00:19:43,846

OPERATION YOU'RE GOING TO

685
00:19:45,214 --> 00:19:46,149

686
00:19:46,149 --> 00:19:47,116
A GOOD IDEA TO GET YOUR

687

YOU CAN'T TIE YOUR SHOES,

717
