00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,342
MY WIFE, BERNICE, TELLS ME
IT WOULD BE REAL NICE

157
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,078
TO HAVE HEAT IN THE UPPER
LEVEL OF THE SHED, HERE.

158
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:48,013
AND WHEN YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED
AS LONG AS I HAVE,

159
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,716
YOU ACCEPT THAT YOUR WIFE'S
DECISIONS ARE NOT ONLY FINAL,

160
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,651
THEY'RE ALSO RELENTLESS.

161
00:05:52,684 --> 00:05:54,920
THE BOTTOM LINE IS
I GOTTA FIGURE OUT A WAY

162
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:58,857
TO GET THIS CAST-IRON WOOD STOVE
UP TO THE SECOND FLOOR.

163
00:05:58,924 --> 00:06:01,393
I SUPPOSE I COULD HORSE
THE UNIT UP ONTO MY BACK

164
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,496
AND THEN CARRY IT
UP THIS LADDER HERE.

165
00:06:04,563 --> 00:06:08,367
BUT THAT WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT
OF PUTTIN' ALL MY VITAL ORGANS

166
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,335
INTO A BLENDER.

167
00:06:10,402 --> 00:06:13,138
BEIN' ON A LADDER WITH AN EXTRA
150 POUNDS ON MY BACK

168
00:06:13,205 --> 00:06:17,176
IS THE REASON MIDDLE-AGED
GUYS DON'T ELOPE.

169
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:20,078
BUT AN EXTENSION LADDER IS
STILL A BIG PART OF MY PLAN.

170
00:06:20,145 --> 00:06:23,048
SEE HOW IT GOES UP WHEN I PULL
ON THIS ROPE, HERE?

171
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,318
REMEMBER THAT.
IT'S A HINT.

172
00:06:29,588 --> 00:06:32,391
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S ANOTHER
PIECE OF THE PUZZLE.

173
00:06:32,457 --> 00:06:34,793
CROSS-COUNTRY SKIS.

174
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:36,161
EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS,

175
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:38,096
SOME HEALTH FREAK GIVES ME
A PAIR OF THESE.

176
00:06:38,163 --> 00:06:40,532
CROSS-COUNTRY SKIING IS
KINDA LIKE DOWNHILL,

177
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,301
BUT WITH THE FUN REMOVED.

178
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:43,869
I'LL TELL YOU,
IF I START CROSS-COUNTRY SKIING,

179
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,837
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE I'M EATIN' BROCCOLI

180
00:06:45,871 --> 00:06:47,940
AND WATCHIN'
THE LEARNING CHANNEL.

181
00:06:51,643 --> 00:06:53,779
OH, DARN,
THEY'RE BROKEN.

182
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:55,781
OH, HERE'S A KEY COMPONENT
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TOO.

183
00:06:55,847 --> 00:06:57,449
A POWER WINCH, EH.

184
00:06:57,482 --> 00:06:59,785
YOU GOT ONE OF THESE ON THE
FRONT OF YOUR VEHICLE?

185
00:06:59,851 --> 00:07:02,054
I TELL YOU, IF I HAD A NICKEL
FOR EVERY DRAINAGE DITCH,

186
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,556
SAND TRAP, OR SWIMMING POOL
THIS UNIT HAS PULLED ME OUT OF,

187
00:07:04,623 --> 00:07:07,459
THOSE DARNED LAWSUITS WOULD
TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES.

188
00:07:07,526 --> 00:07:09,594
ALL RIGHT, THESE ARE
FOR PULLIN' STUFF OUT,

189
00:07:09,628 --> 00:07:12,064
BUT THEY CAN ALSO BE USED
FOR PULLIN' STUFF UP.

190
00:07:13,965 --> 00:07:16,101
CAN YOU SAY FORKLIFT?

191
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:19,705
NOW ALL I GOTTA DO IS HOOK THE
WINCH HERE ON TO THE LADDER,

192
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:22,374
AND WHEN I HIT THE POWER,
UP SHE GOES.

193
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:24,009
LET'S GIVER 'ER A GO.

194
00:07:52,337 --> 00:07:54,239
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
GONNA NEED SOME BALLAST.

195
00:07:57,776 --> 00:07:59,478
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S GOT IT.

196
00:07:59,544 --> 00:08:02,481
THIS IS SO MUCH EASIER THAN
CARRYING THE STOVE UP THERE.

197
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:05,150
SO REMEMBER,

198
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:08,220
IF THE WOMEN DON'T
FIND YOU HANDSOME,

199
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:10,388
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

200
00:08:29,975 --> 00:08:32,744
I WANNA TALK TO YOU MIDDLE-AGED
GUYS OUT THERE FOR A MINUTE.

201
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:34,112
YOU KNOW, THERE'S
AN EXPRESSION,

202
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:37,115
THE APPLE DOESN'T FALL
TOO FAR FROM THE TREE.

203
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:38,817
IN HUMAN TERMS
THAT MEANS,

204
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,952
LIKE FATHER,
LIKE SON.

205
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:44,422
AND IN MOST CASES,
THAT'S A PRETTY SCARY THOUGHT.

206
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:46,358
ESPECIALLY AS YOU
HEAD TOWARD RETIREMENT

207
00:08:46,424 --> 00:08:50,228
AND THAT INEVITABLE MOMENT
WHEN YOUR OFFSPRING NOT
ONLY LOOK LIKE YOU,

208
00:08:50,262 --> 00:08:52,998
THEY START LOOKIN' AFTER YOU.

209
00:08:53,064 --> 00:08:56,167
YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO
BE LIKE YOU, BELIEVE ME.

210
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:58,737
YOU GOTTA START SETTIN'
A BETTER EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW.

211
00:08:58,803 --> 00:09:00,438
NOW, I'M NOT SAYIN'
YOU HAVE TO QUIT BEIN'

212
00:09:00,472 --> 00:09:04,209
THAT LAZY APATHETIC GUY YOU'VE
WORKED SO HARD TO BECOME,

213
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:06,144
JUST NOT IN FRONT
OF THE KIDS,

214
00:09:06,177 --> 00:09:09,481
OR AS I CALL THEM,
YOUR FUTURE CARE GIVERS.

215
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:11,449
YOU NEED TO COME UP
WITH A FEW MOMENTS OF

216
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:14,452
HARD WORK AND
RESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOUR

217
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,588
'CAUSE YOU WANT THEM
TO BE MORE RESPONSIBLE,

218
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:18,289
AND YOU'RE
RUNNIN' OUTTA TIME.

219
00:09:18,356 --> 00:09:19,557
THINK ABOUT IT.

220
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:22,093
YOU DON'T WANT ANYONE LIKE YOU
MAKIN' YOUR MEALS,

221
00:09:22,127 --> 00:09:25,663
DRIVIN' YOU AROUND,
AND SUPERVISING YOUR MEDICATION.

222
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:27,999
SO YOU WANT THAT
APPLE TO FALL

223
00:09:28,032 --> 00:09:30,802
AS FAR AWAY FROM
THE TREE AS POSSIBLE,

224
00:09:30,835 --> 00:09:33,405
MAYBE EVEN ROLL
DOWN A HILL.

225
00:09:33,438 --> 00:09:36,107
REMEMBER, I'M PULLIN'
FOR YOU.

226
00:09:36,174 --> 00:09:37,876
WE'RE ALL IN
THIS TOGETHER.

227
00:09:37,942 --> 00:09:40,111
[ APPLAUSE ]

228
00:09:41,546 --> 00:09:42,947
C'MON IN, RED.

229
00:09:43,014 --> 00:09:43,948
I AM GONNA
CONVINCE YOU

230
00:09:43,982 --> 00:09:45,850
THAT THERE IS SUCH A
THING AS PSYCHIC POWER,

231
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:48,686
AND I'M GONNA DO IT
IN FRONT OF WITNESSES.

232
00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:50,021
IF YOU COULD READ
MY MIND, DALTON,

233
00:09:50,054 --> 00:09:52,190
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN
TRY THIS, YOU KNOW.

234
00:09:52,223 --> 00:09:53,792
PICK A CARD.
PICK A CARD.

235
00:09:53,858 --> 00:09:55,093
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL PICK A CARD.

236
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,628
OKAY,
NOW STARE AT IT.

237
00:09:56,694 --> 00:09:57,929
CONCENTRATE.

238
00:09:57,962 --> 00:10:01,032
SEND A MENTAL PICTURE
OF THAT CARD TO ME.

239
00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:03,234
ARE YOU THINKIN'
OF NAKED WOMEN?

240
00:10:03,268 --> 00:10:04,969
NO.
OH, THAT MUST BE ME.

241
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:08,206
OKAY, CONCENTRATE
ON THAT CARD.

242
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:09,574
IS IT THE
THREE OF CLUBS?

243
00:10:09,607 --> 00:10:11,643
NO.

244
00:10:11,676 --> 00:10:12,911
THE FOUR OF CLUBS?
NO.

245
00:10:12,977 --> 00:10:14,245
IT'S A CLUB, THOUGH.
NO.

246
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:16,514
IT'S A BLACK CARD,
IS WHAT I MEAN.

247
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:17,849
NO, IT'S NOT.

248
00:10:17,882 --> 00:10:19,083
OH, LET ME
SEE THAT!

249
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,618
OH, THERE IT IS.

250
00:10:20,685 --> 00:10:23,521
THE TROUBLE IS, RED,
THAT YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN IT.

251
00:10:23,555 --> 00:10:27,292
NO, NO, NO.
I DON'T BELIEVE IN IT
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WORK.

252
00:10:27,358 --> 00:10:30,061
DID YOU WANNA
SEE ME, Mr. HUMPHREY?

253
00:10:30,128 --> 00:10:32,830
YEAH, MIKE.
I'M TRYING TO CONVINCE RED
HERE THE POWER OF THE MIND,

254
00:10:32,897 --> 00:10:34,299
AND THINK YOU
CAN HELP ME

255
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:35,934
'CAUSE MOOSE THOMPSON SAID
THAT YOU BELIEVE IN ANGELS.

256
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,303
NO, NO, NO.
MIKE BELIEVES IN ANGLES.

257
00:10:38,336 --> 00:10:40,505
NO. NO. NO.

258
00:10:40,538 --> 00:10:42,774
I HAVE AN ANGEL.
HE LOOKS OUT FOR ME.

259
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,676
KINDA KEEPS
ME OUTTA TROUBLE.

260
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:45,810
THERE YOU GO.
YOU SEE?

261
00:10:45,877 --> 00:10:47,745
THAT'S WHAT
I MEAN.

262
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:49,147
YEAH, HE LIVES
UP BACK OF MY PLACE.

263
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,949
OKAY, MIKE,
LET'S NOT GO TOO FAR.

264
00:10:51,983 --> 00:10:54,419
THE ANGEL LIVES
BEHIND YOUR HOUSE?

265
00:10:54,452 --> 00:10:55,887
YES, SIR.

266
00:10:55,953 --> 00:10:57,822
DOES HE HAVE WINGS?
YEP.

267
00:10:57,889 --> 00:10:59,624
MIKE, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO,

268
00:10:59,691 --> 00:11:02,560
BUT LET'S THINK ABOUT
WHAT WE'RE SAYIN' HERE.

269
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:05,630
NO, NO, NO, NO.
I'M ALMOST CONVINCED.

270
00:11:05,663 --> 00:11:07,665
YOU KNOW, WHAT WOULD
MAKE IT WORK GREAT,
THOUGH?

271
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:10,101
IF YOU COULD BRING THAT
ANGEL OVER WHERE I
COULD MEET HIM.

272
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:11,636
THAT WOULD BE
THE CLINCHER.

273
00:11:11,703 --> 00:11:13,071
UH, SORRY.

274
00:11:13,137 --> 00:11:14,939
NO. NO.
UM, SEE, HE'S REAL SHY.

275
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:17,108
OH, OH, OH.

276
00:11:17,141 --> 00:11:18,676
THAT'S A SHAME

277
00:11:18,743 --> 00:11:21,012
BECAUSE YOU WERE
SO CLOSE TO A
BREAKTHROUGH.

278
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:24,248
WELL, MAYBE I CAN CONVINCE HIM
TO COME DOWN TO THE LODGE
MEETING TONIGHT,

279
00:11:24,315 --> 00:11:26,684
IF YOU'RE THAT CONVINCED
YOU WANNA MEET HIM.

280
00:11:26,751 --> 00:11:29,087
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT
A BETTING MAN,

281
00:11:29,153 --> 00:11:31,522
BUT I'D BE WILLING
TO PUT UP, SAY,
TEN BUCKS

282
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:35,326
THAT SAYS MIKE CAN'T GET
HIS ANGEL TO SHOW UP AT
THE LODGE MEETING.

283
00:11:35,393 --> 00:11:37,428
ALL RIGHT, Mr. GREEN,
I'LL TAKE THAT BET,

284
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:38,796
ON ONE CONDITION.

285
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,731
THAT YOU MAKE THE SAME
BET WITH Mr. HUMPHREY.

286
00:11:40,798 --> 00:11:42,233
THAT WAY, WHEN I BRING
MY ANGEL IN,

287
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,768
YOU'LL HAVE TO PAY US
EACH TEN BUCKS.

288
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:45,236
OH, NO,
THAT'S OKAY, MIKE.

289
00:11:45,303 --> 00:11:46,771
NO, NO, Mr. HUMPHREY,
YOU DESERVE IT.

290
00:11:46,838 --> 00:11:48,840
YOU STUCK BY ME WHEN
Mr. GREEN WOULDN'T,

291
00:11:48,906 --> 00:11:51,309
AND I THINK THAT YOU
DESERVE THAT OPPORTUNITY

292
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,977
TO MAKE SOME
EASY CASH.

293
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:55,012
YEAH, I DO TOO,
DALTON.

294
00:11:55,046 --> 00:11:56,747
OKAY, GENTLEMEN,

295
00:11:56,814 --> 00:11:58,349
LET'S SEE
YOUR MONEY.

296
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,151
UH, CAN YOU LEND
ME TEN BUCKS?

297
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:10,161
RED GREEN!
THIS IS AMAZING.

298
00:12:10,228 --> 00:12:12,163
I WAS JUST
THINKING ABOUT YOU.

299
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,399
WELL, I WAVED AT YOU
BEFORE I COME UP, GORD.

300
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:18,436
OH, YEAH, YEAH.
RIGHT.

301
00:12:18,469 --> 00:12:20,204
SO WHAT BRINGS
YOU HERE?

302
00:12:20,271 --> 00:12:22,306
WELL, YOU GAVE ME A ROLL
OF FILM TO GET DEVELOPED.

303
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:24,842
YEAH, BUT THAT WAS ONLY
ABOUT 20 MINUTES AGO.

304
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,811
THAT WAS
LAST MONTH, GORD.

305
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:28,980
REALLY?
YEAH.

306
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:39,991
TIME FLIES.

307
00:12:41,892 --> 00:12:43,728
DO YOU WANT THESE
PICTURES OR NOT?

308
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:45,563
OH, YEAH,
GREAT, THANKS.

309
00:12:45,596 --> 00:12:47,031
DID YOU LOOK
AT THEM?

310
00:12:47,064 --> 00:12:49,066
NO,
I WAS AFRAID TO.

311
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,303
OH, LOOK.
THESE ARE GREAT.

312
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,537
OOPS.

313
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,441
WHAT'S THAT BY
THE TREE, THERE, GORD?

314
00:12:57,475 --> 00:12:59,343
IS THAT A BEAR?
WHAT IS THAT?

315
00:12:59,377 --> 00:13:02,013
NO, THAT'S ONE OF
THOSE TALL HAIRY MEN,

316
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,081
THE, UH --

317
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,084
OH, YOU MEAN
BIGFOOT?

318
00:13:07,151 --> 00:13:08,719
UH, NO,
BIGFEET, ACTUALLY.

319
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:10,921
BOTH OF 'EM,
HUGE.

320
00:13:10,955 --> 00:13:13,124
YEAH, HE JUST TRAMPLED THE NEW
FLOWER BED I JUST MADE,

321
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,725
CRAZY RASCAL.

322
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:17,561
WELL, HOW DO YOU KNOW
IT'S A "HE" AND NOT A "SHE"?

323
00:13:17,595 --> 00:13:20,464
YEAH, THERE'S
A BETTER PICTURE.

324
00:13:20,798 --> 00:13:23,667
OH, YEAH,
THAT'S A HE.

325
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:26,370
YEAH, I CALL HIM FUZZY,
BUT HIS REAL NAME IS

326
00:13:26,403 --> 00:13:28,939
[ GROWLING ]

327
00:13:31,609 --> 00:13:33,511
YOU KNOW, GORD,

328
00:13:33,577 --> 00:13:35,813
THESE PICTURES COULD BE WORTH
A LOT OF MONEY, YOU KNOW.

329
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:38,215
NAH, NAH.
FUZZY DOESN'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

330
00:13:38,282 --> 00:13:40,851
OH, NO, NO, NO.
I MEAN C.N.N.

331
00:13:40,885 --> 00:13:42,219
THEY'D PAY MONEY
FOR THESE

332
00:13:42,286 --> 00:13:45,956
'CAUSE YOU'VE GOT PROOF THAT
THE ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN EXISTS.

333
00:13:46,023 --> 00:13:48,125
I WOULDN'T CALL
HIM ABOMINABLE.

334
00:13:48,192 --> 00:13:51,395
HE'S MORE
TOUGH BUT FAIR.

335
00:13:51,428 --> 00:13:52,696
NO, NO, NO, GORD.

336
00:13:52,763 --> 00:13:54,431
I'M SAYING IF YOU LET ME
TAKE THESE PICTURES, OKAY,

337
00:13:54,465 --> 00:13:56,500
AND I'LL PRESENT THEM
TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE,

338
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:59,303
AND WE WOULD BE LOOKIN' AT
A FAIR MAJOR AMOUNT OF
COIN TO SHARE.

339
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,539
REALLY?

340
00:14:01,572 --> 00:14:03,941
YOU KNOW,
IF WE DO THAT,

341
00:14:04,008 --> 00:14:06,243
I SHOULD BE THE ONE TO ALL
THE TALKING, YOU KNOW,

342
00:14:06,277 --> 00:14:08,345
BECAUSE I AM A
PROFESSIONAL FOREST RANGER.

343
00:14:08,412 --> 00:14:12,316
JUST TO MAINTAIN
CREDIBILITY.

344
00:14:12,349 --> 00:14:15,819
UH, THESE PICTURES
AREN'T THAT GOOD.

345
00:14:15,886 --> 00:14:17,354
NAH.

346
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:20,991
Red:
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?
MIKE HAD A DATE.

347
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:23,794
MY MIND IS AGOG.

348
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:26,230
AND HE'S HAVIN' A GOOD
TIME DRIVING ALONG,

349
00:14:26,263 --> 00:14:28,299
AND I GUESS THIS GIRL
DIDN'T KNOW HIM.

350
00:14:28,332 --> 00:14:31,402
SUDDENLY HE STARTS
TO RUN OUT OF GAS.

351
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:33,937
AND SO DOES THE CAR.

352
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:37,641
NOW HE HAS TO DO WHAT
ALL MEN HATE TO DO,

353
00:14:37,675 --> 00:14:39,410
NO, NOT THAT.

354
00:14:39,443 --> 00:14:41,045
HE HAS TO LOOK
AT THE GAS GAUGE.

355
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:42,946
YEAH, IT LOOKS
A LITTLE DRY THERE.

356
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,182
BUT LOOK,
THIS GIRL KNOWS MIKE.

357
00:14:45,249 --> 00:14:49,019



358
00:14:49,053 --> 00:14:51,789
NOW HE COMES UP
TO HIS NEXT OBSTACLE.

359
00:14:51,855 --> 00:14:53,891
THIS CAR, TECHNICALLY,

360
00:14:53,957 --> 00:14:55,693
ISN'T A CAR HE'S HAD
MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES,

361
00:14:55,726 --> 00:14:58,362
SO HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHERE THE GAS FILLER IS.

362
00:14:58,429 --> 00:15:00,931
THIS IS KIND OF A TIP-OFF.
TRY THE OTHER SIDE,
THERE, MIKE.

363
00:15:00,964 --> 00:15:03,000
NO, I THINK IT'S BEHIND
THE LICENSE PLATE.

364
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:05,235
TRY THE LICENSE PLATE THERE.

365
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:07,538
I DOUBT IF IT WOULD BE --

366
00:15:07,604 --> 00:15:10,007
I DOUBT IT.
I DOUBT IT.

367
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,176
WHAT THE --

368
00:15:12,242 --> 00:15:14,445
OH, OH, OH.

369
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:18,682
THIS IS A MAGNETIC HILL
IN THE POSSUM LAKE AREA.

370
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:21,251
I DON'T THINK MIKE'S
FAMILIAR WITH THAT.

371
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:24,221
AND HE'S ALL --

372
00:15:24,254 --> 00:15:27,291
MIKE, IT'S AN OPTICAL ILLUSION
IT'S A MAGNETIC HILL.

373
00:15:27,357 --> 00:15:29,927
NO, IT'S AN OPTICAL --

374
00:15:29,993 --> 00:15:31,595
WATCH.
THERE'S NOTHIN' TO IT.

375
00:15:31,662 --> 00:15:35,332
SEE?
THAT'S ALL THERE
IS TO THAT.

376
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,368
BUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN HAVE
A LOT OF FUN WITH IT, YEP.

377
00:15:38,435 --> 00:15:39,636
NO, NO, NO.
YOU CAN HAVE A LOT OF FUN.

COME ON.

00:15:40,871 --> 00:15:42,306
FIRST OF ALL,

380
00:15:42,372 --> 00:15:43,874
WE DON'T WANT THE POSSUM VAN
TO GO UP THERE.

381
00:15:43,907 --> 00:15:45,409
GET A LITTLE ROCK THERE.

382
00:15:45,475 --> 00:15:47,110
PUT THAT IN FRONT
OF THE WHEELS.

OKAY, NOTHIN'
TO WORRY ABOUT.

NOW WE CAN HAVE SOME FUN.
COME HERE.

385
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:53,650
ANYTHING I GOT THAT
I WANNA ROLL UP THAT HILL?

386
00:15:53,684 --> 00:15:54,985
HOW ABOUT --

387
00:15:55,018 --> 00:15:56,787
TRY THE SPARE.
TRY THE SPARE.

388
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,821
THIS IS GREAT.

WASN'T THAT GREAT?
UP SHE GOES.

392
00:16:02,993 --> 00:16:04,695
THERE WE GO.

393
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:06,663
WHAT ELSE I GOT IN HERE?

394
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,065
I GOT MORE OF
THOSE BIG BALLS.

395
00:16:08,131 --> 00:16:09,333
YOU KNOW THOSE
BEACH BALL-TYPE THINGS?

396
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,500
LET'S TRY A FEW OF THOSE.

397

DUMP A FEW IN THERE.
DUMP A FEW IN.

WATCH THIS, MIKE, EH?
LET 'EM GO.

LET 'ER RIP.
LET 'ER RIP.

400
00:16:15,772 --> 00:16:16,873
LOOK AT THIS.

401
00:16:16,907 --> 00:16:18,008
THERE GOES ONE.

402
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,443
THERE GOES TWO.

VAN UP THERE.

00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:02,385
OH, RIGHT!

420
00:17:02,452 --> 00:17:05,088
IT'S TIME FOR
MIKE'S TEEN TALK.

421
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,526
OKAY.

422
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:13,630
SO I KNOW A LOT OF YOU
YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE TROUBLE
TELLING THE TRUTH.

423
00:17:13,697 --> 00:17:16,333
WELL, THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE
TRUTH ISN'T ALWAYS THAT SIMPLE.

424
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:18,335
'CAUSE WHAT MIGHT
BE TRUE FOR ONE GUY,

425
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:19,769
LIKE, SAY, YOU OR ME,

426
00:17:19,836 --> 00:17:21,538
MIGHT NOT BE TRUE
FOR SOME OTHER GUY;

427
00:17:21,571 --> 00:17:23,974
LIKE, THE POLICE.

428
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:27,878
AND ALSO, YOU MIGHT BE SO BUSY
MAKING UP YOUR STORY

429
00:17:27,944 --> 00:17:29,479
AND REHEARSING IT FOR SO LONG

430
00:17:29,546 --> 00:17:31,047
AND WORKING AND
WORKING ON IT

431
00:17:31,114 --> 00:17:32,916
THAT YOU THINK IT'S
REALLY THE TRUTH, RIGHT?

432
00:17:32,983 --> 00:17:35,919
AND IT COMES AS A COMPLETE SHOCK
WHEN SOME EYE WITNESS

433
00:17:35,986 --> 00:17:38,488
TELLS YOU YOU'RE LYIN'.

434
00:17:38,555 --> 00:17:40,891
THIS HAPPENS TO ME A LOT.

435
00:17:40,957 --> 00:17:43,226
SO I LIKE TO LOOK FOR
THE DANGER SIGNS

436
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,996
THAT'LL SHOW ME IF I MIGHT
BE TELLING THE TRUTH.

437
00:17:46,062 --> 00:17:49,199
LIKE, IF MY STORY
IS GONNA CAUSE A HASSLE,

438
00:17:49,232 --> 00:17:51,268
OR IF IT'S GONNA
GET PEOPLE IRRITATED,

439
00:17:51,301 --> 00:17:53,670
OR -- AND HERE'S
THE BIG GIVEAWAY,

440
00:17:53,703 --> 00:17:57,707
IF IT SEEMS A LOT MORE UNLIKELY
THAN THE LIE I WAS GONNA TELL,

441
00:17:57,774 --> 00:18:00,310
THEN IT'S PROBABLY THE TRUTH.

442
00:18:00,343 --> 00:18:03,747
SO I'D SAY THAT IF YOU WANNA GET
YOURSELF INTO A LOT OF TROUBLE

443
00:18:03,813 --> 00:18:05,815
AND HAVE PEOPLE MAD AT YOU

444
00:18:05,882 --> 00:18:08,251
AND CALLIN' YOU A LIAR AND ALL
THAT KIND OF STUFF,

445
00:18:08,318 --> 00:18:10,120
THEN, SURE,
TELL THE TRUTH;

446
00:18:10,186 --> 00:18:14,124
OTHERWISE, I'D JUST SORT OF USE
THE TRUTH AS A LAST RESORT.

447
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,893
LIKE THEY DO IN POLITICS.

448
00:18:16,926 --> 00:18:19,829
OH, THAT'S IT.

449
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,532
SO WHAT ARE YOU
LEARNIN' IN SCHOOL
THESE DAYS, DALE?

450
00:18:22,565 --> 00:18:24,834
WELL, MY ECONOMICS
CLASS IS KIND OF
INTERESTING.

451
00:18:24,868 --> 00:18:28,004
WE'RE DOING A
COMPARISON BETWEEN
GUNS AND BUTTER.

452
00:18:28,071 --> 00:18:29,372
OH, YEAH.

453
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:31,074
IS THAT WHAT THE
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM
HAS COME TO NOW?

454
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:33,443
YOU GOTTA GO TO COLLEGE
TO BE ABLE TO TELL
GUNS FROM BUTTER?

455
00:18:33,476 --> 00:18:35,145
WELL, YOU COULD LEARN
ABOUT IT TOO, Mr. GREEN.

456
00:18:35,211 --> 00:18:38,081
I MEAN, THEY'VE GOT
ADULT CLASSES AT NIGHT,
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED.

457
00:18:38,114 --> 00:18:40,717
I'M NOT INTERESTED.
I'M JUST TRYING TO
DISTRACT YOU,

458
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,154
SO YOU'LL PUT MORE GAS IN
THAN THE FIVE BUCKS
I'M PAYIN' FOR.

459
00:18:47,057 --> 00:18:48,758
THAT'LL BE $5,

ANGEL WHISKED HIM OFF
TO HEAVEN, DO YOU?

493

BUT MY ANGEL FINALLY
AGREED TO DROP BY.
