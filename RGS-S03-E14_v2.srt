00:19:18,188 --> 00:19:19,055
OUT WHICH WAY A CAP IS

675
00:19:19,055 --> 00:19:20,390
SUPPOSED TO GO ON.

676
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,724
NOW THIS PART HERE IS THE

677
00:19:21,724 --> 00:19:23,326
HARD PART IT'S THE PEAK

678
00:19:23,326 --> 00:19:24,260
AND ITS JOB IS TO KEEP

679
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,161
THE WEATHER OFF YOUR FACE

680
00:19:25,161 --> 00:19:26,529
BECAUSE UP UNTIL THIS GENERATION

681
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:27,230
THAT WAS THE MOST VALUABLE

682
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,566
SIDE OF A PERSON'S HEAD.

683
00:19:29,566 --> 00:19:30,867
WHEN YOU WEAR THE PEAK ON

684
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:31,968
THE SIDE SOMEBODY'S LIABLE TO

685
00:19:31,968 --> 00:19:32,835
COME TO YOU AND WHISPER RIGHT

686
00:19:32,835 --> 00:19:34,103
INTO YOUR NOSE AND IF THEY'D

687
00:19:34,103 --> 00:19:35,338
JUST EATEN AT A VIETNAMESE

688
00:19:35,338 --> 00:19:36,639
RESTAURANT THAT COULD BE

689
00:19:36,639 --> 00:19:38,575
SERIOUS SO WEAR THE PEAK THE

690
00:19:38,575 --> 00:19:39,509
WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE

691
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:40,343
NOT TO THE SIDE OR AT THE

692
00:19:40,343 --> 00:19:41,144
BACK 'CAUSE THAT LOOKS LIKE

693
00:19:41,144 --> 00:19:42,111
YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY

694
00:19:42,111 --> 00:19:42,979
YOU'RE GOING AND THAT

695
00:19:42,979 --> 00:19:44,247
SHOULDN'T HAPPEN UNTIL

696
00:19:44,247 --> 00:19:45,915
YOU'RE AT LEAST 30.

697
00:19:46,749 --> 00:19:47,617
>>RED: I WAS HOPING

698
00:19:47,617 --> 00:19:48,251
DOUGIE FRANKLIN WOULD LEAD

699
00:19:48,251 --> 00:19:49,085
THE PARADE WITH THIS MONSTER

700
00:19:49,085 --> 00:19:50,353
TRUCK BUT HE HAD OTHER PLANS

701
00:19:50,353 --> 00:19:51,220
HE WANTED TO TURN THIS OLD

702
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,488
CAR OF HIS INTO A GREAT

703
00:19:52,488 --> 00:19:56,092
BIG FISH.

704
00:19:56,092 --> 00:19:56,926
>>DOUGIE: I BROUGHT THIS.

705
00:19:56,926 --> 00:19:57,694

708
00:19:59,228 --> 00:19:59,996
>>RED: AH HAH.

709
00:19:59,996 --> 00:20:00,730
>>DOUGIE: A LITTLE

710
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:01,431
BIT OF SPOT WELDING.

711
00:20:01,431 --> 00:20:02,165
>>RED: YEAH.

712
00:20:02,165 --> 00:20:02,966
>>DOUGIE: IT LOOKS LIKE

713
00:20:02,966 --> 00:20:03,700
A HOOK HANGING OUT OF THE

714
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,534
FISH'S MOUTH YOU KNOW.

715
00:20:04,534 --> 00:20:05,268
>>RED: OKAY I SEE THAT'S

716
00:20:05,268 --> 00:20:06,035
YOUR FISH HOOK.

717
00:20:06,035 --> 00:20:06,703
>>DOUGIE: ARE YOU READY FOR

718
00:20:06,703 --> 00:20:08,504
THE PIESTA RESISTANCE.

719
00:20:08,504 --> 00:20:09,906
>>RED: I THINK I AM DOUG.

720
00:20:09,906 --> 00:20:11,174
>>DOUGIE: PAINT HER PINK.

721
00:20:11,174 --> 00:20:11,908
>>RED: YEAH.

722
00:20:11,908 --> 00:20:12,775
>>DOUGIE: HANG HER ON THERE.

723
00:20:12,775 --> 00:20:13,576
>>RED: YEAH.

724
00:20:13,576 --> 00:20:14,310
>>DOUGIE: WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

725
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,044
>>RED: A WORM.

726
00:20:15,044 --> 00:20:15,945
>>DOUGIE: YOU GOT YOUR

727
00:20:15,945 --> 00:20:16,646
WORM ABSOLUTELY.

728
00:20:16,646 --> 00:20:17,580
>>RED: OH YEAH.

729
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,148
>>DOUGIE: SO I'M THINKING

730
00:20:19,148 --> 00:20:20,383
YOU KNOW WELL I THINK MAYBE

731
00:20:20,383 --> 00:20:21,751
HAROLD COULD DRIVE

732
00:20:21,751 --> 00:20:23,052
OLD ZELDA HERE.

733
00:20:23,052 --> 00:20:24,387
>>RED: OH NO, NO, NO,

734
00:20:24,387 --> 00:20:25,121
THANKS ANYWAY DOUG

735
00:20:25,121 --> 00:20:25,988
BUT I MEAN HAROLD DOESN'T EVEN

736
00:20:25,988 --> 00:20:26,723
HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE.

737
00:20:26,723 --> 00:20:27,623
>>DOUGIE: YOU DON'T NEED

738
00:20:27,623 --> 00:20:29,425
A DRIVER'S LICENSE FOR A PARADE

739
00:20:29,425 --> 00:20:30,760
YOU JUST NEED A BIG BABY

740
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,627
LIKE THIS UP FRONT IN CASE

741
00:20:31,627 --> 00:20:33,429
YOU RUN INTO ANOTHER PARADE

742
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:35,732
OR A FUNERAL OR SOMETHING.

743
00:20:35,732 --> 00:20:38,501
>>RED: OR A PARADE THAT

744
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:40,369
TURNS INTO A FUNERAL.

745
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:41,237
>>DOUGIE: OH YEAH

746
00:20:41,237 --> 00:20:42,772
LIVING ON THE EDGE RED, I DO.

747
00:20:42,772 --> 00:20:45,408
>>RED: I DON'T.

748
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,145
>>RED: WELL THIS WHOLE

749
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:50,213
SALMON PARADE THING RAN

750
00:20:50,213 --> 00:20:53,049
INTO A FEW SNAGS.

751
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:55,852
>>HAROLD: SNAGS? SNAGS?

752
00:20:55,852 --> 00:20:57,220
I THINK IT RAN INTO A LOT

753
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,654
MORE THAN THAT.

754
00:20:58,654 --> 00:21:00,990
>>RED: WELL IN HINDSIGHT

755
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:01,724
I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

756
00:21:01,724 --> 00:21:02,492
THE PARADE ROUTE

757
00:21:02,492 --> 00:21:03,292
IT WAS A 20 MILE LONG WINDING

758
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:05,761
DIRT ROAD INTO TOWN WHICH WAS

759
00:21:05,761 --> 00:21:08,898
POPULATED BY I BELIEVE I COUNTED

760
00:21:08,898 --> 00:21:12,869
3 PEOPLE 2 OF WHOM WERE

761
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:15,805
HITCHHIKING AND SO AFTER

762
00:21:15,805 --> 00:21:17,907
THE FIRST MILE A FEW OF

763
00:21:17,907 --> 00:21:20,776
THE GUYS STARTED TO FIDGET.

764
00:21:20,776 --> 00:21:21,377
>>HAROLD: I LOVE THIS

765
00:21:21,377 --> 00:21:22,078
FIDGET IS THAT WHAT

766
00:21:22,078 --> 00:21:24,180
YOU CALL IT, FIDGET?

767
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:24,881
>>RED: WELL THAT'S WHAT

768
00:21:24,881 --> 00:21:28,284
I TOLD THE COPS.

769
00:21:28,284 --> 00:21:30,086
IT STARTED WHEN JUNIOR SINGLETON

770
00:21:30,086 --> 00:21:31,254
TRIED TO PASS STINKY PETERSON

771
00:21:31,254 --> 00:21:32,188
BECAUSE HE COULDN'T STAND

772
00:21:32,188 --> 00:21:35,491
THE FUMES COMING OFF HIS FUMES

773
00:21:35,491 --> 00:21:36,359
OR THE FUMES COMING OFF HIS

774
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,593
SHIRT EITHER, SO THEN JUNIOR

775
00:21:37,593 --> 00:21:38,794
AND STINKY STARTED TO JOCKEY

776
00:21:38,794 --> 00:21:40,463
FOR POSITION AND THEN OF

777
00:21:40,463 --> 00:21:41,797
COURSE OLD MAN SEDGEWICK

778
00:21:41,797 --> 00:21:43,366
DIDN'T WANT TO BE LAPPED AND

779
00:21:43,366 --> 00:21:44,433
AT THAT POINT IT GOT A LITTLE

780
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:46,168
OUT OF CONTROL AND THE WHOLE

781
00:21:46,168 --> 00:21:51,274
PARADE KIND OF SPED UP A TAD.

782
00:21:51,274 --> 00:21:53,209
>>HAROLD: YEAH I THINK WHEN

783
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:54,310
YOU BROKE THE SPEED LIMIT

784
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,977
TECHNICALLY IT WAS

785
00:21:54,977 --> 00:21:55,878
NO LONGER A PARADE.

786
00:21:55,878 --> 00:21:56,712
>>RED: NO AND OF COURSE

787
00:21:56,712 --> 00:21:58,581
A LOT OF THE FLOATS WERE

788
00:21:58,581 --> 00:22:02,251
BUILT FOR THE SLOWER SPEEDS

789
00:22:02,251 --> 00:22:04,020
SO YOU KNOW THE PLYWOOD AND

790
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,255
THE CARDBOARD STARTED FLYING OFF

791
00:22:06,255 --> 00:22:07,089
YOU KNOW PRETTY SOON IT WAS

792
00:22:07,089 --> 00:22:08,157
MORE OF AN OBSTACLE COURSE

793
00:22:08,157 --> 00:22:10,960
MOTOCROSS KIND OF A THING.

794
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,861
>>HAROLD: THEN YOU KNOW

795
00:22:11,861 --> 00:22:12,762
STINKY JUNIOR AND MOOSE ALL

796
00:22:12,762 --> 00:22:14,196
CAME YOU KNOW SLAMMING INTO

797
00:22:14,196 --> 00:22:15,264
THAT ONE LANE BRIDGE OVER

798
00:22:15,264 --> 00:22:16,298
MERCURY CREEK THERE IT SORT

799
00:22:16,298 --> 00:22:17,166
OF BECAME A DEMOLITION

800
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,368
DERBY THING.

801
00:22:19,368 --> 00:22:20,836
>>RED: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

802
00:22:20,836 --> 00:22:22,171
ANYWAY I MEAN ALL INSURANCE

803
00:22:22,171 --> 00:22:23,406
CLAIMS ASIDE AND EVERYTHING

804
00:22:23,406 --> 00:22:25,307
I THINK IT CAME OUT PRETTY

805
00:22:25,307 --> 00:22:27,076
EVEN BUT OF COURSE WE COULD

806
00:22:27,076 --> 00:22:29,278
NO LONGER MAKE IT INTO

807
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:30,379
TOWN SO I CANCELLED

808
00:22:30,379 --> 00:22:32,281
THE SALMON PARADE.

809
00:22:32,281 --> 00:22:33,516
>>HAROLD: YOU HAD TO CANCEL?

810
00:22:33,516 --> 00:22:35,117
YOU HAD TO CANCEL IT!

811
00:22:35,117 --> 00:22:36,218
AFTER THE CRASH ALL THE GAS,

812
00:22:36,218 --> 00:22:37,119
OIL AND TRANSMISSION FLUID

813
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:38,754
HIT MERCURY CREEK

814
00:22:38,754 --> 00:22:39,688
THE SALMON SAW IT AND DID

815
00:22:39,688 --> 00:22:42,091
A QUICK 180 BACK TO OPEN WATER.

816
00:22:42,091 --> 00:22:45,428
OUTTA THERE!

817
00:22:45,428 --> 00:22:46,729
(POSSUM SQUEALS)

818
00:22:46,729 --> 00:22:47,530
>>HAROLD: OH HEY THAT'S

819

00:22:48,364 --> 00:22:49,098

824
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:53,969
>>HAROLD: OKAY.

825
00:22:53,969 --> 00:22:54,637
>>RED: I'LL BE DOWN

826
00:22:54,637 --> 00:22:55,404

827
00:22:55,404 --> 00:22:57,840
>>HAROLD: ALRIGHTIE.

828
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,441
>>RED: WELL USUALLY I LOVE

829
00:22:59,441 --> 00:23:00,509
A PARADE BUT I CAN'T

830
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:01,477
SAY I HAD A LOT OF FEELING

831
00:23:01,477 --> 00:23:03,445
FOR THIS ONE.

832
00:23:03,445 --> 00:23:04,613
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING

833
00:23:04,613 --> 00:23:05,614
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME

834
00:23:05,614 --> 00:23:06,615
AFTER THE MEETING AND I TOLD

835
00:23:06,615 --> 00:23:08,083
THE GUYS THAT THEY CAN KEEP

836
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:09,552
ALL THEIR FLOATS IN OUR DRIVEWAY

837
00:23:09,552 --> 00:23:12,087
UNTIL THEY STOP SMOLDERING

838
00:23:12,087 --> 00:23:13,055
SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO CLOSE

839
00:23:13,055 --> 00:23:13,923
THE LIVING ROOM DRAPES FOR

840
00:23:13,923 --> 00:23:16,125
