THERE ARE LOTS OF OCCASIONS
WHERE A MAN HAS TO STAND

FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME...

3

AT A PARADE OR
AT A FUNERAL

4
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:12,345

SAYS, "NOW, YOU JUST STAND
RIGHT THERE."

YOU'RE A LOT HAPPIER
SITTIN' DOWN.

00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:18,752
THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT
LESS THEY CAN STAND FOR.

WELL, HERE'S A NIFTY TRICK.

A LITTLE BACK ON IT.

BARSTOOLS BEFORE I
FOUND THIS BABY.

MEASURE AROUND YOURSELF,

AROUND YOUR KNEES,
INCLUDING THE BACK.

13
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:38,104
THEN YOU GO DOWN TO YOUR LOCAL
FAT GUY CLOTHING STORE

14
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:41,908
AND GET YOURSELF MATCHING
CLOTHES IN THAT SIZE.

15
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:45,011
AND IF THE GUY ASKS YOU HOW
COME YOU NEED PANTS THAT BIG,

16
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:48,148
YOU TELL HIM BECAUSE THEY NEED
TO GO AROUND YOUR STOOL.

17
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,987
USE A BARREL HOOP AS A BELT
SO YOUR PANTS WILL KEEP
THEIR SHAPE.

ALL THERE IS TO IT.

SOMETHING I DON'T LIKE

154
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,877
AND FIND A WAY
TO DO IT MORE OFTEN.

155
00:07:25,877 --> 00:07:29,581
WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER IF
WE COULD CRAM FOUR WEEKS
OF TRASH INTO ONE CAN?

156
00:07:29,581 --> 00:07:31,850
WE'D ONLY HAVE TO TAKE THE
GARBAGE OUT ONCE A MONTH.

157
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,886
SO TODAY ON HANDYMAN CORNER
WE'RE NOT JUST TALKIN' TRASH,

158
00:07:34,886 --> 00:07:37,322
WE'RE TALKIN'
TRASH COMPACTOR.

159
00:07:37,322 --> 00:07:40,025
I STARTED BY FILLING THIS
GARBAGE CAN WITH CEMENT.

160
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:41,693
NEXT STEP...

161
00:07:41,693 --> 00:07:44,096
GENTLY REMOVE THE
HARDENED CONCRETE.

162
00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:03,682
OKAY, NOW THIS WHOLE ASSEMBLY
IS GOING TO DO THE COMPACTING.

163
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:07,185
THAT'S WHY I USED
A COMPACT CAR.

164
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:10,021
SEE, ACTUALLY, THE CEMENT
IS ALREADY HEAVY ENOUGH,

165
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:12,390
BUT THEN YOU HOOK IT
ONTO A VEHICLE,

166
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,860
THAT GARBAGE IS GOING TO BE
FEELING AS MUCH DOWNWARD
PRESSURE

167
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,828
AS MOOSE THOMPSON'S FEET.

168
00:08:16,828 --> 00:08:18,964
AND OF COURSE, THE WHOLE
PROCESS IS MECHANIZED;

169
00:08:18,964 --> 00:08:21,366
OTHERWISE, IT WOULD
REQUIRE MANUAL LABOUR,

170
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:25,437
AND AS YOU KNOW, I HAVE NO USE
FOR ANY KIND OF MANUAL.

171
00:08:25,437 --> 00:08:28,573
I'VE ATTACHED THE GARBAGE
CAN TO THE GARAGE DOOR

172
00:08:28,573 --> 00:08:30,742
WITH THIS HOOK
I GOT OFF A TOW TRUCK.

173
00:08:30,742 --> 00:08:32,844
YOU CAN GET
THESE PRETTY CHEAP.

174
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:35,013
JUST SLAM ON YOUR BRAKES
WHILE YOU'RE BEIN' TOWED.

175
00:08:35,013 --> 00:08:40,151
NOW ALL'S WE DO IS TOSS THE
GARBAGE BAGS INTO THE CAN.

176
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:43,555
LOOK FULL TO YOU?
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

177
00:08:58,837 --> 00:09:00,572
AND THERE'S THE END OF IT.

178
00:09:00,572 --> 00:09:02,641
SO REMEMBER: IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

179
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:04,843
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

180
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:07,078
OH, BOY.

181
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:19,190
JUST FOR THE RECORD...

182
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,559
18 BAGS IS THE LIMIT.

183
00:09:50,822 --> 00:09:52,991
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A
THEORY THAT MAN'S LIFE

184
00:09:52,991 --> 00:09:55,593
IS A LONG LIST OF
SANDWICHES.

185
00:09:55,593 --> 00:09:58,496
LIKE, WHEN YOU'RE A KID,
YOU'RE PEANUT BUTTER AND JAM.

186
00:09:58,496 --> 00:10:01,499
LIFE IS SWEET,
NO CRUSTS.

187
00:10:01,499 --> 00:10:03,668
THEN YOU GET
TO BE A TEENAGER,

188
00:10:03,668 --> 00:10:05,703
YOU'RE A TOASTED CLUBHOUSE.

189
00:10:05,703 --> 00:10:07,739
YOU GOT A LITTLE
BACON GOIN' FOR YOU,

190
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:09,874
BUT THE GIRLS STILL STAY AWAY
BECAUSE EITHER THEY'RE CHICKEN

191
00:10:09,874 --> 00:10:12,710
OR YOU'RE A TURKEY.

192
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,780
THEN AS A YOUNG MAN,
YOU BECOME A HAM AND CHEESE --

193
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,715
MORE HAM THAN CHEESE,

194
00:10:17,715 --> 00:10:20,118
BUT THAT WILL REVERSE
AS YOU GET OLDER.

195
00:10:20,118 --> 00:10:24,656
BUT MAYBE NOW YOU'VE REACHED
THE NOT SO HEALTHY SANDWICH
YEARS, HUH?

196
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:29,460
THE BIG, FAT, GREASY
CORNED-BEEF-ON-A-KAISER YEARS.

197
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,964
THINGS ARE HANGING OUT
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

198
00:10:32,964 --> 00:10:35,767
YOU'RE LOOKIN' KINDA ROUGH.

199
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:38,836
YOU'VE BIGGIE
SIZED YOURSELF.

200
00:10:38,836 --> 00:10:41,773
YOUR FAT CONTENT
IS THROUGH THE ROOF.

201
00:10:41,773 --> 00:10:43,908
AND IF YOU DON'T START
SAVING SOME BREAD SOON,

202
00:10:43,908 --> 00:10:47,312
YOU COULD
END UP OPEN-FACED.

203
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:49,881
OKAY, THIS IS WHEN
YOU NEED YOUR WIFE'S HELP.

204
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:54,319
YOUR WIFE IS THE SPOONFUL OF
COLESLAW THAT CAN SAVE
YOUR LIFE.

205
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:56,254
YOU BE NICE TO HER,

206
00:10:56,254 --> 00:10:59,490
BECAUSE IF SHE LEAVES,
YOU'VE HAD THE BUN.

207
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:03,394
AND YOU ARE WAY TOO OLD
TO BE HOLDIN' THE PICKLE.

208
00:11:03,394 --> 00:11:05,263
REMEMBER,
I'M PULLIN' FOR YOU.

209
00:11:05,263 --> 00:11:07,465
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

210

WE CAME, WE SAW,

213
00:11:16,474 --> 00:11:18,943
WE SUCKED.

214
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,982
WELL, THIS WHOLE COMMUNIST
EXPERIMENT ISN'T
GOIN' TOO BAD.

I'M GETTIN' PAID
FOR DOIN' NOTHIN',

216
00:11:27,518 --> 00:11:30,488
SO IT'S NOT THAT
MUCH OF AN ADJUSTMENT.

217
00:11:30,488 --> 00:11:32,824
ACTUALLY THINKIN' ABOUT
CHANGIN' THE NAME OF THE LODGE

218
00:11:32,824 --> 00:11:35,693
TO RED GREEN SQUARE.

219
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:38,896
UM, UNCLE RED.

220
00:11:38,896 --> 00:11:41,399
WE MIGHT HAVE
A BIT OF A PROBLEM.

221
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,434
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
UNDER THE COMMUNIST SYSTEM

222
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:45,570
ALL INDUSTRY IS OWNED
BY THE GOVERNMENT.

223
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:49,774
SO, UH, TECHNICALLY,
THIS SHOW BELONGS TO
THE GOVERNMENT.

224
00:11:49,774 --> 00:11:53,611
WELL, I'M SURE THEY'LL
CHANGE THEIR MINDS ONCE
THEY SEE IT, HAROLD.

225
00:11:53,611 --> 00:11:56,481
YES, BUT NO INDIVIDUAL
IS ALLOWED TO REAP
CAPITAL GAINS,

226
00:11:56,481 --> 00:12:00,117
SO THEREFORE, YOU HAVE
TO TURN OVER ALL YOUR
PROFITS FOR THE SHOW.

227
00:12:00,117 --> 00:12:03,654
WHAT, YOU MEAN
FOR ALL 13 SEASONS?

A KILLER, HAROLD.

CAN YOU
CHANGE A 20?

230
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:11,529
OKAY, GREAT.

MR. GREEN,
THIS IS NOT WORKING!

232
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:16,901
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
MIKE?

233
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:19,604
YOU SEE EVERYBODY DRESSED
IN THE GREYS AND YOU
GET HOMESICK?

234
00:12:19,604 --> 00:12:21,672
NO!

235
00:12:21,672 --> 00:12:24,575
NO, IT'S JUST WHEN
EVERYBODY OWNS EVERYTHING

236
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:27,778
THEN NOBODY'S GOT
ANYTHING WORTH STEALIN'.

237
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:30,881
IT'S THE END OF THE

I'M IN THE
SAME BOAT, RED.

TO PUMP OUT THEIR SEPTICS,

I CAN'T CHARGE ANYTHING,

PAY ANYTHING.

FOR YOUR RELATIVES.

BUSINESS AS USUAL.

OH, NO!
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

OH, IT'S
NO PROBLEM, HAROLD.

WE BUILT A WALL
AROUND OUR SECTION.

OF WRECKED CARS.

OUT BEHIND THE LODGE.

HE WANTED TO DO
A LITTLE DRYWALL WORK,

257
00:13:16,127 --> 00:13:17,962
AND I HAD THE
INSTRUCTIONS THERE

INTO AN AIRPLANE,

PLANS THERE AS WELL.
