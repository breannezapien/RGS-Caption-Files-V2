WITH THIS OLD
BICYCLE HERE.

00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:29,201
NOW THESE THINGS HAD
A LITTLE UNIT ON THE BACK,

95
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:32,805
A LITTLE GENERATOR,
THAT WORKED BY THE
ROTATION OF THE TIRE, HERE.

96
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:36,342
AND THE POWER WOULD
GO UP THE WIRE AND
AROUND THE CROSSBAR,

97
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:37,810
YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL
OF THAT, AND IT WOULD GO

98
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,378
UP INTO THE
HEADLIGHT HERE.

99
00:04:39,378 --> 00:04:41,247
THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH
THESE THINGS IS THAT
THEY REQUIRED

100
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,516
A FAIR AMOUNT OF SPEED.
YOU GOT TO BE GOING AT
A PRETTY GOOD CLIP

101
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,317
IN ORDER TO GET SOME
LIGHT COMING OUT
OF THIS THING.

102
00:04:45,317 --> 00:04:46,585
SO YOU WOULD BE
RIDING ALONG AT NIGHT

103
00:04:46,585 --> 00:04:48,020
AND YOU THINK YOU SEE
SOMETHING UP AHEAD,

104
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,989
IT COULD BE A BRICK WALL
OR A TRAIN WRECK
OR WHATEVER,

105
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,324
YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO
SPEED UP TO SEE IT.

106
00:04:52,324 --> 00:04:55,694
BY THE TIME YOU DO,
YOU'RE GOING TOO
FAST TO STOP.

107
00:04:55,694 --> 00:04:57,463
SO I THINK THE SAFEST
THING TO DO WITH
THESE UNITS

108
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,598
IS TO TAKE THEM RIGHT
OFF THE ROAD AND
TURN THEM

109
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:03,068
INTO A STATIONARY POWER
GENERATOR/EXERCYCLE.

110
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:05,704
NOW TO DO THAT YOU'RE
GOING TO NEED A WHACK
OF WIRE LIKE THIS

111
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:09,241
AND A REAL
STURDY SAWHORSE.

112
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,913
OKAY, NOW I GOT THE
BIKE GENERATOR HOOKED UP
TO THE WIRE THAT I SHOWED YOU.

113
00:05:14,913 --> 00:05:16,548
THE ELECTRICITY WILL
GO AROUND, AROUND THERE,

114
00:05:16,548 --> 00:05:18,884
AND I GOT IT
HOOKED UP TO THIS
NORMAL LIGHTBULB.

115
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:20,686
AND I'M GOING TO SHOW
YOU HOW WE CAN USE
THE BIKE

116
00:05:20,686 --> 00:05:22,388
TO GENERATE HOUSEHOLD
ELECTRICITY.

117
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:23,756
I ALSO GOT HER UP
ON THE SAWHORSE THERE

118
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,724
SO THE BIKE WON'T
GO ANYWHERE.

119
00:05:25,724 --> 00:05:28,594
AND THE IDEA IS YOU
JUST KEEP PEDALING
'TILL IT'S BEDTIME

120
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:30,462
AND THEN YOUR LIGHTS
WILL GO OUT.

00:05:30,462 --> 00:05:34,433

OUT LONG BEFORE THAT.

122

123
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:40,706
HMMM.
ALL RIGHT.

124
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:46,245
LET'S TRY A PLAN THAT
DOESN'T INVOLVE
CARDIAC CARE.

125
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:49,782
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T
KNOW THIS BUT EVERY
ELECTRIC MOTOR

126
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,450
CAN BE USED AS
A GENERATOR.

127
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,385
ALL'S YOU DO IS WIRE
IT UP BACKWARDS

128
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:56,555
AND THEN PUT A
MAGNETIC FIELD IN THERE
AND TURN THE ARMATURE.

129
00:05:56,555 --> 00:06:01,160
IN LAYMEN'S TERMS THAT
MEANS THE OLD GUY
RIDES THE BIKE

130
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,662
AND THE
LIGHT GOES ON.

131
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,345
WELL, THEN, GLAD THAT
WASN'T THE STOVE.

132
00:06:20,345 --> 00:06:23,148
ALL RIGHT, THE PROBLEM
WE HAVE NOW IS THAT WE
GOT SO MUCH POWER

133
00:06:23,148 --> 00:06:24,783
WE HAVE TO REGULATE IT
AND TO DO THAT

134
00:06:24,783 --> 00:06:26,618
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SOME
VEHICLE BATTERIES.

135
00:06:26,618 --> 00:06:29,021
NOW IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
GETTING A HOLD OF
VEHICLE BATTERIES,

136
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:33,859
JUST GO OVER TO A
MALL PARKING LOT WITH A
CROWBAR AND 9/16 WRENCH.

137
00:06:35,527 --> 00:06:38,597
ALL RIGHT.
NOW USING THE
MOTOR AS A GENERATOR,

138
00:06:38,597 --> 00:06:42,067
I HAVE JUST PUMPED UP
A HUGE WAD OF ELECTRICITY

139
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:44,803

ALL I HAVE TO DO IS
FLICK THIS SWITCH.
IT'S THAT EASY.

145
00:06:55,747 --> 00:06:58,116
SO REMEMBER, IF WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

146
00:06:58,116 --> 00:07:00,152
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

147
00:07:00,152 --> 00:07:02,821
LET'S GIVE IT A TRY.

148
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:18,070
WELL, THERE'S A
LESSON FOR YOU.

149
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,173
A GENERATOR CAN ALSO
TURN BACK INTO A MOTOR,

150
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:24,443
AND A BICYCLE CAN TURN
INTO AN ELECTRIC
MOTORCYCLE,

151
00:07:25,677 --> 00:07:27,879
AND AN ELECTRIC
MOTORCYCLE CAN TURN
INTO AN OUTHOUSE.

152
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:30,615
HEY, BUSTER,
DON'T GET UP.

153
00:07:31,683 --> 00:07:33,185
RED GREEN:
STAY TUNED.

154
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:35,520
BILL GOES RIDING ON
ONE OF THOSE WAVE
RIDER THINGS

155
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,656
AND HAROLD PROVES
THAT NOT EVERYBODY

156
00:07:37,656 --> 00:07:39,624
SHOULD BE OUT
IN THE WOODS.

157
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:46,231
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
MIDDLE AGE GUYS OUT THERE.

158
00:07:46,231 --> 00:07:48,600
NOW, I KNOW THIS MAY
BE A LITTLE HARD TO TAKE,

159
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,335
BUT I GOT TO SAY
IT ANYWAY,

160
00:07:50,335 --> 00:07:52,170
WHEN YOU GET TO BE
AS OLD AS WE ARE,

161
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:58,076
AND I KNOW IT'S HOT
OUTSIDE, BUT YOU GOT
TO STOP GOING TOPLESS.

162
00:07:58,076 --> 00:08:02,914
PLEASE FOR GOD SAKES
WEAR A T-SHIRT AT
ALL TIMES.

163
00:08:02,914 --> 00:08:06,184
YEAH, I KNOW, 20 YEARS
AGO I DIDN'T LOOK SO
BAD EITHER

164
00:08:06,184 --> 00:08:08,720
IN NOTHING BUT SHORTS
AND A PAIR OF
RUNNING SHOES,

165
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,424
BUT EVEN I'M GIVING MY
NEIGHBOURS A BREAK NOW.

166
00:08:12,424 --> 00:08:15,260
I MEAN, WE USED TO
LOOK LIKE HARD
WASHBOARDS,

167
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,296
NOW WE LOOK
LIKE SEA COWS.

168
00:08:18,296 --> 00:08:20,899
SOME OF US HAVE BREASTS
AND IT'S SCARING
THE KIDS

169
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:25,036
AND CONFUSING
THE BABIES.

170
00:08:25,036 --> 00:08:27,505
AND THAT'S A LOT OF
HAIR TO LOOK AT.

171
00:08:27,505 --> 00:08:30,775
STRANGE CLUMPS ON
THE BACK AND ON
THE SIDE,

172
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:36,548
COMING OUT THE NOSE
AND THE EARS AND
NONE ON THE HEAD.

173
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:41,987
IT'S LIKE YOUR SKIN
GOT TOO TIRED TO HOLD
YOUR HAIR UP THAT HIGH.

174
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:43,555
SO WEAR A SHIRT, OKAY,

175
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:45,423
BECAUSE WHEN A SHIRT
FLAPS AND WRINKLES
IN THE BREEZE,

176
00:08:45,423 --> 00:08:46,958
IT DOESN'T
LOOK TOO BAD.

177
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,095
WHEN SKIN DOES THAT,
THAT IS NOT PRETTY.

178
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:52,130
REMEMBER, I'M
PULLING FOR YOU.

179
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,766
WE'RE ALL IN
THIS TOGETHER.

180
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,140
WELL, THE POSSUM LODGE
POWER PLANT IS ALL SET
TO GO ON LINE,

181
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,943
WE'RE GOING TO BE
TOTALLY SELF-RELIANT --

182
00:09:04,943 --> 00:09:06,378
WELL, IN TERMS OF
ELECTRICITY.

183
00:09:06,378 --> 00:09:09,047
OUR WIVES STILL HAVE TO
DRESS US IN THE MORNING,
YOU KNOW.

184
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:11,082
YOU GUYS BUILT A
POWER DAM THAT
QUICKLY, HUH?

185
00:09:11,082 --> 00:09:12,851
NO, NO, WE GAVE UP
ON THAT ONE, HAROLD.

186
00:09:12,851 --> 00:09:14,753
BEAVERS CAN MAKE DAMS.

187
00:09:14,753 --> 00:09:15,887
WE HAD A REAL
PROBLEM WITH IT.

188
00:09:15,887 --> 00:09:17,022
DID YOU USE BIG
ENOUGH TREES,

189
00:09:17,022 --> 00:09:18,890
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE
BEAVERS USE PRETTY
BIG TREES?

190
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,593
OH YEAH.
YEAH, WE
USED HUGE TREES.

191
00:09:21,593 --> 00:09:24,529
IN FACT OLD MAN
SEDGEWICK EVEN CHEWED
A COUPLE DOWN, YOU KNOW,

192
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:28,032
UNTIL HIS DENTURES
WEDGED INTO A BIRCH
BARK THERE.

193
00:09:28,032 --> 00:09:30,001
I TELL YOU, THERE IS
NOTHING SO ODD LOOKING

194
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:33,004
AS A TREE WITH A
BIG TOOTHY GRIN.

195
00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:39,444
ALL RIGHT, I
STAND CORRECTED.

196
00:09:39,444 --> 00:09:43,415
AND YOU KNOW THEN
WE THOUGHT OF USING
THE SOLAR-POWERED LIGHTS

197
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:45,250
LIKE BUSTER
HADFIELD HAS.

198
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,818
OH, YOU MEAN THE
HOLES IN HIS ROOF?

199
00:09:46,818 --> 00:09:48,386
YEAH.
YEAH.

200
00:09:48,386 --> 00:09:50,088
BUT JUNIOR SINGLETON
HAD A GREAT IDEA.

201
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:51,756
HE'S GOT SOME CARS
AROUND THE BACK OF
HIS HOUSE,

202
00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:54,058
WE WENT AROUND THERE,
TOOK OUT THE
ALTERNATORS,

203
00:09:54,058 --> 00:09:55,660
OKAY, 'CAUSE EVERY
ALTERNATOR GIVES
YOU 12 VOLTS,

204
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,497
SO YOU GET 10
OF THEM IN A ROW,
THERE'S YOUR 120.

205
00:09:59,497 --> 00:10:01,799
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO
USE TO POWER THE
ALTERNATORS?

206
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,901
WELL, ELECTRIC
MOTORS.

207
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:04,469
WE TOOK THE STARTING
MOTORS OUT OF THE
SAME CARS,

208
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:06,271
SO YOU PUT THE
STARTING MOTOR
TO THE ALTERNATOR,

209
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:07,906
THAT'S HOW
THAT WORKS.

210
00:10:07,906 --> 00:10:10,074
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO
USE TO POWER THE
POWER MOTORS?

211
00:10:10,074 --> 00:10:11,943
THE ALTERNATORS,
HAROLD.

212
00:10:11,943 --> 00:10:15,547
YEAH, I KNOW, OKAY.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
BUT WHAT ARE YOU --

213
00:10:15,547 --> 00:10:17,315
OKAY.
NO.
NEVER MIND.

214
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:19,284
OKAY.
YEAH.

215
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:22,220
JUST LET ME KNOW
IF IT WORKS.

216
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,689
WELL, WHY SHOULDN'T
IT WORK?

217
00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:28,059
[ POWER HUM ]
OKAY.
OKAY.

218
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:29,761
SOUNDS LIKE THE WHOLE
SYSTEM IS ALL SET

219
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:34,999
TO COME ON LINE
HERE, HAROLD.
HERE WE GO.

220
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:38,870
[ EXPLOSION ]

221
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:44,609
EVERYTHING YOU'RE
WATCHING IS
FOR SALE.

222
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:49,914
AUNT BERNICE SHOWED
ME A PICTURE OF YOU
WHEN YOU WERE A TEENAGER.

223
00:10:49,914 --> 00:10:51,783
YOU WERE WITH YOUR
FIRST STUDEBAKER.

224
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:54,252
YOU WERE MUCH
THINNER THEN.

225
00:10:54,252 --> 00:10:56,587
WELL, THAT'S AN OPTICAL
ILLUSION, HAROLD.

226
00:10:56,587 --> 00:10:58,056
CARS WERE A LOT
BIGGER IN THOSE DAYS.

227
00:10:58,056 --> 00:10:59,590
NO.
NO.

228
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,827
YOU WERE MAJORLY THIN.
YOU WERE LIKE NORMAL SIZE.

229
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:05,396
ACTUALLY, I NOTICED A LOT
OF THE GUYS UP HERE
AT THE LODGE

230
00:11:05,396 --> 00:11:11,302
ARE ON THAT
BEEFY, HEFTY, YOU
KNOW, CORPULENT SIZE.

231
00:11:11,302 --> 00:11:13,738
THAT'S A METABOLISM
THING, HAROLD.

232
00:11:13,738 --> 00:11:16,007
YOU KNOW, AS YOU GET
OLDER YOU DON'T NEED
AS MUCH FOOD

233
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:17,475
TO MAINTAIN THE
SAME BODY WEIGHT.

234
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:19,210
WELL, THAT'S GOING
NOT GOING TO
HAPPEN TO ME.

235
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,945
I'M GOING TO
STAY IN SHAPE.

236
00:11:20,945 --> 00:11:24,549
THAT SHAPE THERE?
YES.

237
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:27,018
WELL, I GUESS YOU
GET A BIT OF EXERCISE

238
00:11:27,018 --> 00:11:30,421
RUNNING AWAY FROM GIRLS
AND BULLIES AND DOGS.

239
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:32,757
DOGS.
A LOT OF DOGS.

240
00:11:32,757 --> 00:11:34,992
WITH ANY LUCK THAT
WILL MAINTAIN RIGHT
THROUGH YOUR ADULT LIFE.

241
00:11:34,992 --> 00:11:37,061
BUT HAROLD I THINK
BY THE TIME YOU'RE
MY AGE,

242
00:11:37,061 --> 00:11:38,896
YOU WILL BE GOING
AROUND 400 POUNDS

243
00:11:38,896 --> 00:11:40,231
AND LYING IN A
HAMMOCK SOMEWHERE

244
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:42,400
WITH YOUR ARM WRAPPED
AROUND AN OXYGEN TANK.

245
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,136
THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE
ME BECAUSE I'M GOING
TO WATCH MY WEIGHT,

246
00:11:45,136 --> 00:11:47,638
I'M GOING TO EAT RIGHT
AND I'M GOING TO
STAY IN SHAPE.

247
00:11:47,638 --> 00:11:49,707
WELL, YOU BETTER
START NOW, HAROLD.

248
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:52,343
AH, COME ON, PLEASE,
I JUST WANT TO
TAKE FIVE.

249
00:11:52,343 --> 00:11:55,112
ALL RIGHT.
IF YOU WANT TO GROW
UP LOOKING LIKE ME.

250
00:11:55,112 --> 00:11:58,916
I'LL TAKE IT.
I'LL TAKE IT.
THANKS VERY MUCH.

251
00:12:04,856 --> 00:12:07,458
WIND'S IS COMING
UP HAROLD.

252
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,894
JUST BURN THE
WHOLE THING?
YEAH.

253
00:12:10,962 --> 00:12:12,196
WITH A BUNCH OF
US ON THE BRINK

254
00:12:12,196 --> 00:12:13,831
OF GENERATING OUR OWN
ELECTRICITY UP HERE,

255
00:12:13,831 --> 00:12:14,966
I THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE A GOOD TIME

256
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:16,601
TO TALK ABOUT THE
OPPORTUNITIES OF
THE NORTH.

257
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:19,003
AND WHAT BETTER GUY TO
TALK TO THAN WINSTON
ROTHCHILD

258
00:12:19,003 --> 00:12:21,672
OF ROTHCHILD'S SEWAGE
AND SEPTIC SUCKING
SERVICES.

259
00:12:21,672 --> 00:12:23,708
WHERE OUR MOTTO IS
NO JOB TOO HUMBLE,

260
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,611
NO CUSTOMER
TOO STUCK UP.

261
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:27,845
THAT'S A DANDY.

262
00:12:27,845 --> 00:12:29,580
NOW, WINSTON, I THINK
MAYBE A LOT OF OUR
URBAN VIEWERS

263
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,549
ARE THINKING ABOUT
MOVING UP HERE AND
STARTING OVER.

264
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:33,884
OH YEAH, YOU KNOW,
THAT REMINDS ME A
LOT OF MY DAD, EH?

265
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:37,288
HE WAS FOREVER, YOU
KNOW, STARTING OVER
AND MOVING UP.

266
00:12:37,288 --> 00:12:39,724
YOU KNOW, FOR INSTANCE,
I GOT 12 STEP-BROTHERS,

267
00:12:39,724 --> 00:12:43,394
NINE STEP-MOMS AND
THREE STEP-FRIENDS.

268
00:12:43,394 --> 00:12:46,364
YEAH, HIS MOTTO ALWAYS
WAS THE GRASS IS
ALWAYS GREENER

269
00:12:46,364 --> 00:12:49,667
ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE DOOR.

270
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:52,403
OH, I JUST
ABOUT FORGOT, DO
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

271
00:12:52,403 --> 00:12:54,505
I HAVEN'T TOLD
YOU THIS YET,
HAVE I?
NO.

272
00:12:54,505 --> 00:12:56,140
WELL SOME PIN HEAD
STOLE THE ALTERNATOR

273
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,842
AND STARTER OUT
OF THE HONEY WAGON.

274
00:12:57,842 --> 00:12:59,477
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

275
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:01,512
PEOPLE ARE SCUM,
YOU KNOW.
OH, THEY ARE.

276
00:13:01,512 --> 00:13:03,981
YEAH, THEY ARE.
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS,
THE PEOPLE FROM THE CITY

277
00:13:03,981 --> 00:13:06,350
THEY THINK WE'RE
TECHNOLOGICALLY BEHIND
THE TIMES UP HERE.

278
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,153
OH, THAT'S YOUR
INFORMATION SUPER
HIGHWAY THERE.

279
00:13:09,153 --> 00:13:12,356
I GOT A COMPUTER
FOR MY OPERATION.
OH YEAH?

280
00:13:12,356 --> 00:13:15,126
WHICH OPERATION,
THE GALL BLADDER
OR THE YOU KNOW?

281
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:17,628
NO, NO. NO.
MY SEWAGE BUSINESS.

282
00:13:17,628 --> 00:13:21,832
OH, YEAH.
COME ON AND SEE IT.
ALL RIGHT.

283
00:13:21,832 --> 00:13:25,236
YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
RED, I GOT MY ENTIRE
LIFE ON ONE OF THESE.

284
00:13:25,236 --> 00:13:27,805
IT'S WHAT THEY
CALL A FLABBY
DISK, EH?

285
00:13:27,805 --> 00:13:29,974
LET ME SHOW YOU HOW
IT WORKS 'CAUSE IT'S
REALLY EXCITING.

286
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:31,342
OKAY.
YOU PLUG IT IN.

287
00:13:31,342 --> 00:13:33,144
AND THEN YOU PUSH A
COUPLE OF BUTTONS
ON THE MACHINE.

288
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:34,411
AND YOU SEE THAT?
YEAH.

289
00:13:34,411 --> 00:13:36,947
THAT'S ALL
THE PEOPLE WHOSE
TANKS I'VE SUCKED.

290
00:13:36,947 --> 00:13:38,282
WOW.
RIGHT?

291
00:13:38,282 --> 00:13:40,151
AND THEN YOU PUSH A
COUPLE MORE BUTTONS,
YOU SEE THAT?

292
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:42,853
THAT'S ALL THE PEOPLE
WHOSE TANKS NEED
SUCKING.

293
00:13:42,853 --> 00:13:44,155
YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.
YEAH.

294
00:13:44,155 --> 00:13:45,890
AND THEN YOU CAN
GET INTO YOUR
BOOKKEEPING.

295
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,658
SEE THERE'S
ACCOUNTS DECEIVABLE.

296
00:13:47,658 --> 00:13:48,959
AND SO ON.
WOW.

297
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,694
SO IT'S REALLY
STREAMLINED THE
OPERATION, EH?

298
00:13:50,694 --> 00:13:53,330
IT'S MADE IT
MORE HANDS ON.

299
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,165
IS THAT A GOOD IDEA IN
THIS LINE OF WORK
DO YOU THINK?

300
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:57,368
OH, YEAH.
ABSOLUTELY.

301
00:13:57,368 --> 00:13:59,370
SO LISTEN, IF YOU'RE
THINKING OF COMING OUT HERE,

302
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,538
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT,

303
00:14:00,538 --> 00:14:02,239
'CAUSE YOU CAN USE THE
SAME TOOLS YOU WOULD

304
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,275
IN A REAL URBAN
CENTRE, EH?

305
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:07,111
WHEN I THINK OF
HOW MY LIFE WOULD BE

306
00:14:07,111 --> 00:14:09,079
WITHOUT THE COMPUTER
AND THE MODEM

307
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:11,348
AND THE CELL PHONE
AND THE FAX,

308
00:14:11,348 --> 00:14:13,050
WELL, GEEZ, I WOULD
JUST BE ANOTHER GUY

309
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,487
WITH AN ODD
SMELLING TRUCK.

310
00:14:18,722 --> 00:14:20,724
RED GREEN:
WELL, BILL'S
GOT A NEW TOY TODAY

311
00:14:20,724 --> 00:14:21,959
ON ADVENTURES WITH BILL.

312
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,661
THIS IS ONE OF THESE
WAVE RIDER THINGS.

313
00:14:23,661 --> 00:14:25,296
AND THIS THING HERE
IS CALLED A KILL SWITCH.

314
00:14:25,296 --> 00:14:26,563
WHAT THIS DOES,
IT CLIPS IN HERE

315
00:14:26,563 --> 00:14:29,066
AND THEN THE UNIT
WOULD ACTUALLY
START FOR YOU.

316
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:32,002
AND ONCE YOU GOT
IT RUNNING, SAY YOU
FALL OFF OR SOMETHING,

317
00:14:32,002 --> 00:14:34,805
THEN THIS THINGS
SPRINGS OUT AND
IT STOPS.

318
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:37,541
BILL IS REAL PROUD
OF THAT KILL SWITCH UNIT

319
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,110
AND THE SPRINGINESS
OF IT AND SO ON.

320
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,681
MAYBE A LITTLE LESS
PROUD OF IT NOW
THAN HE WAS.

321
00:14:43,681 --> 00:14:45,049
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
NO PROBLEM?

322
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:46,650
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
GO OUT THERE WITH --

323
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,218
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

324
00:14:48,218 --> 00:14:50,788
OH MY GOSH.

325
00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:52,556
THAT'S THE IGNITION
WIRES, BILL.

326
00:14:52,556 --> 00:14:56,894
WHAT ARE YOU -- OH,
HE'S GOING TO --
THIS IS CLEVER.

327
00:14:56,894 --> 00:14:58,162
THAT'S HOW THAT WORKS.

328
00:14:58,162 --> 00:15:00,831
AND RIGHT NEAR THE
WATER, THAT'S REAL SMART.

329
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:03,767
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT
WOULD HAPPEN, BILL?

330
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:06,003
ALLRIGHT, I GOT
TO GO SAVE HIM.

331
00:15:06,003 --> 00:15:08,238
LUCKILY, I KEEP THE BOAT
RUNNING AT ALL TIMES.

332
00:15:08,238 --> 00:15:09,940
NAIL HER!
NAIL HER!

333
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,076
BEAUTIFUL, RUNS LIKE
IT WAS BRAND NEW.

334
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:14,745
AND OUT I GO, HANG ON,
BILL, I'M COMING.

335
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:16,447
I'M THINKING IF I CAN
GET THE BOAT HOOK THERE

336
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:17,915
AND HOOK IT DOWN
IN BETWEEN THE WIRES,

337
00:15:17,915 --> 00:15:20,184
PULL THE WIRES APART AND
THAT WILL KILL THE MOTOR

338
00:15:20,184 --> 00:15:22,286
AND JUST -- HOLD STILL
BILL, HOLD STILL.

339
00:15:22,286 --> 00:15:23,987
I GOTCHA.
I GOTCHA.
I GOTCHA.

340
00:15:23,987 --> 00:15:26,757
OH MY GOSH.
SORRY BILL.

341
00:15:26,757 --> 00:15:28,992
THEN I GOT THE WIRES
AND HOOKED THEM THERE --

342
00:15:28,992 --> 00:15:30,427
YEAH, THERE WE GO.
THERE WE GO.

343
00:15:30,427 --> 00:15:32,262
AND THEN I HOOKED IT
AND THAT HOOKED
ON THERE.

344
00:15:32,262 --> 00:15:33,730
BUT OF COURSE IT
STOPPED NOW

345
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,833
SO IT PULLS ME RIGHT
OUT OF MY SEAT OVER
THE BACK.

346
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,335
OH MY GOSH.
THE WATER IS SO COLD.

347
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:39,536
OH MY GOSH.

348
00:15:39,536 --> 00:15:42,272
NOW THE BOAT IS GOING
FULL THROTTLE,
NO DRIVER.

349
00:15:42,272 --> 00:15:43,941
INTERESTING.

350
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:45,275
HELP, BILL, HELP.

351
00:15:45,275 --> 00:15:47,578
BILL HAD TAKEN THE
AMBULANCE COURSE

352
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:50,747
WHERE THEY TEACH YOU HOW
TO SAVE SOMEBODY'S HAT.

353
00:15:50,747 --> 00:15:52,816
THANK YOU, BILL.

354
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:54,284
YOU KNOW THERE'S A
TIME FOR HUMOUR

355
00:15:54,284 --> 00:15:56,253
AND THERE'S A
TIME FOR BILL.

356
00:15:56,253 --> 00:15:58,722
THE TIME FOR BILL IS
NOT GOING TO BE
DURING MY LIFE.

357
00:15:58,722 --> 00:16:00,390
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

358
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,925
NOW, THE BOAT IS
HEADING RIGHT
TOWARDS US.

359
00:16:01,925 --> 00:16:04,094
BILL, BILL!
WE GOTTA GO,
GOTTA GO, GOTTA GO!

360
00:16:06,296 --> 00:16:08,432
RED GREEN: STAY TUNED
FOR DOUGIE AND DALTON

361
00:16:08,432 --> 00:16:10,334
IN A DISCUSSION YOU
WON'T WANT TO MISS

362
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:14,304
AND BUZZ SHERWOOD SHOWS
YOU WHY HE CAME IN LAST
ON THE DEBATING TEAM.

363
00:16:19,242 --> 00:16:23,614
WELL, THE POSSUM LODGE
POWER PLANT IS REALLY
GOING ON LINE THIS TIME.

364
00:16:23,614 --> 00:16:27,284
YOU GUYS FIXED
ALL THOSE ALTERNATORS
AND ELECTRIC MOTORS?

365
00:16:27,284 --> 00:16:31,722
OH, HAROLD, THAT
IDEA COULDN'T WORK.
ANY IDIOT KNOWS THAT.

366
00:16:31,722 --> 00:16:37,627
NO, NO, NO, WE
DECIDED TO SWITCH
OVER TO NUCLEAR POWER.

367
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:44,668
I'M SORRY?
YEAH.

368
00:16:44,668 --> 00:16:47,704
GOOD OLD-FASHIONED,
CLEAN, SAFE,
NUCLEAR POWER.

369
00:16:47,704 --> 00:16:51,675
GOT OURSELVES A
CAN-DO REACTOR, HAROLD.

370
00:16:51,675 --> 00:16:53,710
A CANDU REACTOR, YOU MEAN
A REAL CANADIAN

371
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,146
DEUTERIUM HEAVY WATER
FISSION REACTOR?

372
00:16:56,146 --> 00:16:57,347
NO, NO, NO.

373
00:16:57,347 --> 00:17:00,584
THIS IS JUST A REACTOR
BUILT BY A BUNCH
OF CAN-DO GUYS.

374
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:03,920
JUNIOR SINGLETON GOT ALL
THE PLANS OUT OF A BOOK
HIS SON HAD

375
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,424
CALLED THE HOW AND
WHY BIG BOOK OF
ELECTRICITY.

376
00:17:07,424 --> 00:17:10,227
THE ONLY TOUGH PART
WAS FINDING THE
RADIOACTIVE FUEL,

377
00:17:10,227 --> 00:17:11,828
SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE
SCRAPED ALL THE RADIUM

378
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:14,598
OFF OF THOSE GLOW IN
THE DARK WATCHES.

379
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:16,800
I'LL TELL YOU, HAROLD,
WHERE ELSE BUT AT
POSSUM LODGE

380
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,436
COULD YOU DO SOMETHING
THIS GREAT, HUH?

381
00:17:19,436 --> 00:17:22,539
CHERNOBYL
SPRINGS TO MIND.

382
00:17:25,475 --> 00:17:28,111
HERE WE ARE WITH OUR
RESIDENT BUSH PILOT,
BUZZ SHERWOOD.

383
00:17:28,111 --> 00:17:29,346
HOW YOU DO
DOING TODAY BUZZ?

384
00:17:29,346 --> 00:17:30,780
HEY, RED!

385
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,050
HAROLD!

386
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,952
BUZZ, I WAS HOPING
TODAY YOU COULD
TEACH US

387
00:17:35,952 --> 00:17:37,320
HOW TO LAND A
PLANE ON THE WATER.

388
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,889
NO CAN DO,
RED, NOT TODAY.

389
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:40,257
TODAY I'M GOING
TO LEAD THE PEOPLE

390
00:17:40,257 --> 00:17:42,959
AND WE ARE GOING TO
PROTEST THE NUCLEAR
POWER PLANT.

391
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:44,027
WELL, I THINK YOU
SHOULD WAIT UNTIL

392
00:17:44,027 --> 00:17:45,562
THERE'S SOMETHING WORTH
PROTESTING, DON'T YOU?

393
00:17:45,562 --> 00:17:47,898
HEY, HEY, YOU CAN'T
DENY ME MY FREEDOM
OF SPEECH HERE, MAN.

394
00:17:47,898 --> 00:17:49,499
YOU KNOW PROTESTING
NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS

395
00:17:49,499 --> 00:17:51,601
IS WHAT FORMED
THIS COUNTRY.

396
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:54,638
BUZZ, YOU GOT TO STOP
READING HISTORY BOOKS
WRITTEN BY JOAN BIAZ.

397
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:56,506
OH, COME ON MAN, RED,
IT WILL BE GREAT TO
GET OUT THERE

398
00:17:56,506 --> 00:17:58,341
AND MARCH AGAIN AND
CHANT AND PROTEST

399
00:17:58,341 --> 00:18:00,310
AND YOU START THINKING
I'M MAKING A DIFFERENCE,

400
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,312
AND ALL ALONG,
YOU KNOW, YOU START
THINKING WELL, NO,

401
00:18:02,312 --> 00:18:04,881
IT'S A TOTAL WASTE OF
TIME AND I'M USELESS.

402
00:18:04,881 --> 00:18:07,017
BUT I MIGHT MEET SOME
LIKE-MINDED WOMEN.

403
00:18:07,017 --> 00:18:08,585
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO
WAIT 'TILL AFTER
THE ARRESTS,

404
00:18:08,585 --> 00:18:10,353
THAT'S WHEN THEY'RE
MORE RECEPTIVE.

405
00:18:10,353 --> 00:18:12,322
NOBODY AROUND
HERE WANTS TO GET
ARRESTED, ALL RIGHT?

406
00:18:12,322 --> 00:18:14,190
OH THEY'VE JUST
FORGOTTEN HOW MUCH
FUN IT CAN BE, RED.

407
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,727
THAT'S WHY I'VE STARTED
MY CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE
REFRESHER COURSE.

408
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,263
I CALL IT RIOT 101.
LOOK AT THIS.

409
00:18:20,263 --> 00:18:22,899
THE FIRST THING YOU
GOT TO DO IS YOUR
SIGNS, RIGHT?

410
00:18:22,899 --> 00:18:25,769
HERE YOU TAKE
THAT ONE.

411
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:28,038
NOW I HAVE ADAPTED THIS
OF COURSE TO OUR CURRENT
POLITICAL SITUATION,

412
00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:29,739
BUT I'VE HEARD
THEY STILL WORK.

413
00:18:29,739 --> 00:18:31,641
YOU KNOW, RED, IF YOU
FEEL IT IN YOUR HEART,

414
00:18:31,641 --> 00:18:33,877
YOU GOT TO LIVE
IT IN YOUR LIFE,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

415
00:18:33,877 --> 00:18:36,980
WELL, I THINK MAKING
THEM OUT OF COMBUSTIBLE
MATERIALS IS A GOOD PLAN.

416
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,949
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE TELEVISION
LOVES A GOOD FIRE.

417
00:18:39,949 --> 00:18:41,351
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
TELEVISION LIKES?

418
00:18:41,351 --> 00:18:43,153
YOU GOT TO TALK
IN THOSE SOUND
BITES, RIGHT?

419
00:18:43,153 --> 00:18:44,487
SO IT GOES LIKE
THIS, YOU GO:

420
00:18:44,487 --> 00:18:46,689
IT'S A DISASTER
WAITING TO HAPPEN.

421
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:48,158
THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.

422
00:18:48,158 --> 00:18:50,126
OR: WOULD YOU RAISE YOUR
CHILDREN NEXT TO THAT?

423
00:18:50,126 --> 00:18:51,594
I LIKE THAT ONE.

424
00:18:51,594 --> 00:18:53,029
OR THERE'S THIS ONE:
YOU SHUT UP.

425
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:54,064
NO YOU SHUT UP!

426
00:18:54,064 --> 00:18:55,565
SHUT UP!
YOU'RE A LIAR!

427
00:18:55,565 --> 00:18:59,102
SHUT UP!
NO YOU SHUT UP!
NO YOU SHUT UP!

428
00:18:59,102 --> 00:19:01,771
IT'S THE 90S, NOBODY
CARES ABOUT ANYTHING
ANYMORE.

429
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:04,574
THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING
TO DO, I'M GOING TO
PROTEST APATHY.

430
00:19:04,574 --> 00:19:06,576
I'M GOING TO RID
THE WORLD OF APATHY.

431
00:19:06,576 --> 00:19:07,644
AND WHEN ARE YOU
GOING TO DO THAT?

432
00:19:07,644 --> 00:19:10,413
WHAT'S IT TO YOU?
THAT'S TRUE.

433
00:19:11,581 --> 00:19:13,483
JOINING MY UNCLE RED
ON THE EXPERT PORTION

THIS WEEK IS MR. DOUGIE

[ APPLAUSE ]

436
00:19:21,624 --> 00:19:23,393
HAROLD, HAROLD,
READ THIS ONE,
READ THIS ONE.

437
00:19:23,393 --> 00:19:25,628
NO, I GOT A LETTER
WAY MORE BETTER,
WAY MORE BETTER.

438
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:29,499
DEAR EXPERTS:

439
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:33,503
SHOULD GAY PEOPLE BE
ALLOWED TO SERVE IN
THE MILITARY?

440
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:37,707
OH.
OH.
OH.

441
00:19:37,707 --> 00:19:39,108
HAROLD, I WANTED YOU
TO READ THIS ONE.

442
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:41,377
THIS GUY HERE HE WANTS TO
KNOW WHAT'S THE BEST
KIND OF SANDWICH,

443
00:19:41,377 --> 00:19:44,447
PEANUT BUTTER AND BANANA
OR CORNED BEEF AND
CHEESE SPREAD.

444
00:19:44,447 --> 00:19:46,182
NO, NO, YOU SEE BECAUSE
THIS IS RATINGS WEEK,
UNCLE RED,

445
00:19:46,182 --> 00:19:47,584
WE GOT TO BE
CONTROVERSIAL,

446
00:19:47,584 --> 00:19:51,588
WE GOT TO HIT THOSE
HOT TOPICS, YOU KNOW,
THE BIZ.

447
00:19:53,957 --> 00:19:57,060
ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL ANSWER IT.

448
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,428
DOUGIE?
DALTON?

449
00:19:58,428 --> 00:20:01,931
WELL, TO BE HONEST, RED,
I SORT OF PREPARED
A LITTLE BIT

450
00:20:01,931 --> 00:20:04,367
TO GO WITH THAT
PEANUT BUTTER AND
BANANA BUSINESS.

451
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:07,737
I WAS PUSHING
THE CORNED BEEF
AND CHEESE SPREAD.

452
00:20:07,737 --> 00:20:09,272
I DON'T REALLY HAVE
MUCH OF AN OPINION

453
00:20:09,272 --> 00:20:11,174
ON GAYS IN
THE MILITARY.

454
00:20:11,174 --> 00:20:15,244
YOU DO NOW.

455
00:20:15,244 --> 00:20:17,647
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

456
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:19,449
LET'S GO BACK TO
THE ANCIENT GREEKS

457
00:20:19,449 --> 00:20:21,284
WHO HAD A LOT
OF GAY SOLDIERS

458
00:20:21,284 --> 00:20:24,554
AND THEY WERE A
PRETTY IMPRESSIVE
MILITARY MACHINE.

459
00:20:24,554 --> 00:20:26,189
YOU KNOW THEY
WOULD RUN A MARATHON,

460
00:20:26,189 --> 00:20:28,758
THEY'D HAVE PLENTY
OF STRENGTH LEFT TO
FIGHT A BIG BATTLE

461
00:20:28,758 --> 00:20:30,927
BECAUSE THEY ATE A
LOT OF RED MEAT AND
DAIRY PRODUCTS

462
00:20:30,927 --> 00:20:33,496
LIKE CORNED BEEF
AND PROCESSED CHEESE.

463
00:20:35,331 --> 00:20:37,033
WAIT A SECOND.
WAIT A SECOND.

464
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:38,901
YOUR NORMAL PEOPLE,
I BELIEVE,

465
00:20:38,901 --> 00:20:42,438
MUCH PREFER THE DELICIOUS
COMBINATION OF PEANUT
BUTTER AND BANANA.

466
00:20:42,438 --> 00:20:48,044
I BELIEVE YOUR PERVERTS ARE
INTO YOUR CORNED BEEF
AND CHEESE BUSINESS,

467
00:20:48,044 --> 00:20:50,980
WHICH TO ME IS JUST
TOTALLY UNNATURAL.

468
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,218
CORNED BEEF AND CHEESE
SPREAD IS JUST AS NORMAL
AS PEANUT BUTTER AND BANANA.

469
00:20:55,218 --> 00:20:57,220
IT'S A MATTER OF
PERSONAL CHOICE.

470
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:02,058
WELL, ALL I'M SAYING IS
SHOULD YOUR CORN BEEF
AND CHEESE TYPES

471
00:21:02,058 --> 00:21:04,961
BE ALLOWED TO MINGLE
WITH, YOU KNOW,

472
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:09,532
YOUR PEANUT BUTTER
AND BANANA PEOPLE?

473
00:21:09,532 --> 00:21:12,401
MY ANSWER TO THAT
QUESTION IS, NO, SIR,

474
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:14,637
THEY SHOULD NOT BECAUSE
IT WILL LOWER MORALE

475
00:21:14,637 --> 00:21:17,006
AND IT'S JUST A MATTER
OF TIME BEFORE SOMEBODY

476
00:21:17,006 --> 00:21:22,311
IS GOING TO GET THEIR
CRUSTS CUT OFF.

477
00:21:22,311 --> 00:21:26,616
THERE ARE PLENTY OF
GAYS ALREADY IN
THE MILITARY

478
00:21:26,616 --> 00:21:31,287
AND IT'S JUST AS NATURAL
AS RYE BREAD WITH A
PICKLE ON THE SIDE.

479
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:32,521
FINE.
FINE.

480
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:36,292
ALL I'M SAYING IS
HOLD THE PICKLE.

481
00:21:36,292 --> 00:21:37,860
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

482
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,762
HAROLD, THIS HAS
GONE COMPLETELY
OUT OF CONTROL.

483
00:21:39,762 --> 00:21:44,233
WELL, IT'S AT A
STALEMATE, UNCLE RED,
YOU HAVE TO BREAK THE TIE.

484
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:47,136
ALL RIGHT.
ACTUALLY, I'M KIND OF
HUNGRY WITH ALL THIS.

485
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,638
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
I'LL GIVE YOU
AN OPINION

486
00:21:48,638 --> 00:21:50,072
RIGHT AFTER I
MAKE MYSELF A
SANDWICH.

487
00:21:50,072 --> 00:21:53,142
WHAT KIND?
WHAT KIND?

488
00:21:53,142 --> 00:21:55,344
HAM.
STRAIGHT HAM.

489
00:22:12,228 --> 00:22:15,431
ARE YOU OKAY?

490
00:22:15,431 --> 00:22:17,333
DON'T EVER STAND NEAR
A NUCLEAR REACTOR

491
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:21,170
OR IN FACT ANY TALL
METAL DEVICE DURING
A SEVERE THUNDERSTORM.

492
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,671
YOU GOT HIT
BY LIGHTNING?

493
00:22:22,671 --> 00:22:26,175
OH, MAN.
THE NUCLEAR REACTOR
GOT NUKED, HAROLD.

494
00:22:26,175 --> 00:22:29,078
WE'RE BACK TO BUYING
OUR POWER FROM THE
UTILITIES AGAIN.

495
00:22:29,078 --> 00:22:31,113
WHAT ABOUT THAT ELECTRIC
FENCE ALL AROUND MOOSE
THOMPSON'S HOUSE

496
00:22:31,113 --> 00:22:32,681
TO KEEP THE
TRESPASSERS OUT?

497
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:33,949
OH, GOOD NEWS THERE.

498
00:22:33,949 --> 00:22:37,119
IT SHORTED OUT AGAIN,
BURNT MOOSE'S HOUSE
TO THE GROUND.

499
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:39,321
SO ALL'S WELL
THAT ENDS WELL.

YEAH.
YOU GO AHEAD,
HAROLD.

502
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,895
I'M GOING TO
GET CLEANED UP.
I'LL BE DOWN SOON.

AND IF MY WIFE
IS WATCHING,

504

I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT
HOME AFTER THE MEETING.

505
00:22:49,365 --> 00:22:51,033

MOOD TO GET GROUNDED

WHAT I MEAN.
