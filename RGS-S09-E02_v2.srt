1
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,537
ALL YOU FATHERS OUT
THERE KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE

2
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:07,640
WHEN YOU TRY TO GET YOUR
TEENAGERS TO DO A BIT
OF YARD WORK.

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:11,077
THEY CAN'T TRIM THE HEDGES
FOR MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES
WITHOUT TAKIN' A BREAK.

4
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:12,312
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,814
I'VE COME UP WITH A WAY TO
KEEP YOUR TEENAGERS IN GEAR

6
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:16,583
WITHOUT HAVIN' TO
KEEP AN EYE ON 'EM.

7
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,755
WE'VE ALL SEEN THESE
MOTION DETECTORS.

8
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,890
WELL, I'VE WIRED
THIS ONE UP BACKWARDS.

9
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:26,059
IT'S A LACK
OF MOTION DETECTOR.

10
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,894
SEE, AS LONG
AS THERE'S MOTION,

11
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:29,295
THE LIGHT GOES OFF.

12
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,431
AS SOON AS THERE'S
NO MOTION,

13
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:33,633
THE LIGHT COMES ON.

14
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,135
NOW, A LIGHT GOIN'
ON OR OFF

15
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,003
IS GONNA HAVE NO EFFECT
ON YOUR TEENAGER.

16
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,805
IF THEY DON'T RESPOND
TO A SUNRISE,

17
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,207
A 60-WATT BULB ISN'T
GONNA IMPRESS 'EM.

18
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:42,709
SO WHAT WE'RE
GONNA DO IS

19
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:44,911
WE'RE GONNA
UNPLUG THIS LAMP

20
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:49,115
AND PLUG IN A PRERECORDED
TAPE THAT PLAYS ON THIS
CASSETTE PLAYER.

21
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:50,583
THEN ALL YOU DO IS

22
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:52,785
AIM THE MOTION DETECTOR
AT YOUR TEENAGER,

23
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:54,320
AND AS LONG AS HE'S MOVIN',

24
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,955
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

25
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:57,357
BUT THE MINUTE HE
STOPS ...

26
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,925
Hey what are you
doin' sittin' around?

27
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,093
Get back to work.

28
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,961
You call that effort?
Get off your duff.

29
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,432
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

30
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:10,403
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
APPRECIATE IT.

31
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,639
BIT OF A SETBACK,
ACTUALLY, THIS WEEK.

32
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:15,408
THIS IS THE ANNUAL
POSSUM LAKE FISHING DERBY,

33
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:18,311
AND SO FAR, NOBODY'S
CAUGHT ANY FISH.

34
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:21,147
AND I'LL TELL YA,
IF THAT KEEPS UP, UH,

35
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,982
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO GIVE AWAY THE GREAT PRIZE.

36
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:26,919
SECOND PRIZE IS A BUS
TICKET TO PORT ASBESTOS.

37
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:29,522
AND IF YOU WIN
THE FIRST PRIZE,

38
00:01:29,555 --> 00:01:31,357
THEY MAKE IT ROUND TRIP.

39
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:35,361
BUT, UH, SO FAR, LIKE I SAY,
THERE'S BEEN NO WINNERS.

40
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,196
SO I THINK THEY SHOULD
CHANGE THE RULES.

41
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,699
I THINK THEY SHOULD GIVE THE
PRIZE TO THE GUY WITH THE
BIGGEST LURE.

42
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:44,570
RED, RED.
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

43
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,139
LOOK WHAT I CAUGHT.
WOW.

44
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:47,573
WOW, THAT'S
A BEAUTY.

45
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,342
IS THAT
A BLOWFISH?

46
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,012
17 POUNDS!

47
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,915
SEE, I THINK THE FISHIN' DERBY
SHOULD BE FOR THE HEAVIEST
THING YOU CAN CATCH.

48
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,750
DOESN'T HAVE
TO BE FISH.

49
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,085
NO.

50
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,521
COULD BE A SNOWMOBILE
OR A STOVE.

51
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,256
I GOT A BETTER IDEA,
Mr. GREEN.

52
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:05,992
IT SHOULD BE A
LIVING THING TO WIN.

53
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,693
IF CAN'T BE A FISH,

54
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,129
IT SHOULD BE
SOMETHING ELSE ALIVE.

55
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:11,831
LIKE A SWIMMER?

56
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:15,868
NO, LIKE A PLANT
OR A TREE.

57
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,238
OH, MAN.

58
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,209
I SNAGGED
THIS BEAUTY

59
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,178
IN MERCURY CREEK,
DOWN BY THE BRIDGE.

60
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:26,979
YEAH, THAT'S WHEN HALF
THE SANTA CLAUS PARADE

61
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:29,649
WENT OFF THE BRIDGE
AND FELL INTO THE LAKE.

62
00:02:30,716 --> 00:02:33,019
THEY CALL THOSE
THINGS FLOATS.

63

[ LAUGHTER ]

64
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,823
OH, WAIT A SECOND.
THAT'S NOT LIVING,

65
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,625
THAT'S ARTIFICIAL, MIKE.
THAT WON'T WORK.

66
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,495
WELL, WE GOTTA COME UP
WITH A BETTER WAY
TO CATCH FISH.

67
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:46,465
WE COULD DRAG A BIG NET
FROM ONE END OF THE LAKE
TO THE OTHER, RIGHT.

68
00:02:46,532 --> 00:02:48,100
WHERE WE GONNA GET
A NET THAT SIZE?

69
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,236
THE TENNIS CLUB.

70
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,939
THEY DON'T LOCK
THAT GATE.

71
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:55,641
NO, LOOK, THE TROUBLE
IS THERE ISN'T ANY FISH.

72
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,744
I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST TEST THE WATER
IN THE LAKE.

73
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,313
YOU KNOW WHAT
WE COULD DO, EH?

74
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,114
WE COULD DRAIN
THE WHOLE THING, HUH?

75
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,416
HOOK ALL OUR CARS
UP THERE,

IN BY THE BOAT RAMP,

AS DRY AS A MARTINI

SEE, I THINK WE SHOULD
TEST THE WATER IN THE LAKE.

81
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:17,897
YOU KNOW, I'VE HEARD THAT IF
YOU FIRE OFF A BIG CHARGE OF
DYNAMITE UNDER WATER,

82
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,765
YOU CAN FISH WITH

CLEANING OUT YOUR EAVESTROUGHS
IS SOMETHING YOU SHOULD DO
ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.

86
00:03:32,945 --> 00:03:36,716
NO MATTER HOW MANY TREES
I BLOW UP, I STILL GET
LEAVES IN 'EM.

SO HERE'S AN EASY WAY
TO CLEAN EM' OUT.

90
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:48,728
YOU BORROW A HUNK OF HOSE
FROM A LOCAL BUILDING.

91
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,430
YOU MIGHT WANT TO HOSE
DOWN THE BUILDING

00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:53,332
FOR SAFETY.

93
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,634
THEN YOU ATTACH
THE NOZZLE

94
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:58,971
TO THE BOTTOM PART OF THE
DOWNSPOUT ON YOUR EAVESTROUGH

MUST GO UP,

IT'LL WORK JUST AS GOOD.

AND THEN YOU NEED A JACK,

BUT YOU DON'T WANT
THIS KIND OF JACK.

173

NOW, YOU MAY NOTICE WITH
THAT PARTICULAR METHOD OF
REMOVING THE SEAT,

184
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:52,070
THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF
DAMAGE TO THE FLOOR AREA,

AHEAD OF MYSELF.

WE GOTTA DO NOW

IS MOUNT THE JACK TO
THE INSIDE OF THE ROOF.

[ GRUNTING ]

00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:19,698

TO FILL THE GAP

THE SPARE TIRE'S GONNA BE.

FROM THE ROOF,

AND WE GOT THE SPARE HANGIN'
FROM THE JACK,

AND THE WHOLE UNIT IS POSITIONED
OVER OUR BIG HOLE IN THE FLOOR.

INTO OR OUT OF A REAL TIGHT

UH, "ONCE THE METHYL ALCOHOL
CONTAMINANTS HAVE BEEN REMOVED,

456
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,739
"THE REMAINING IMPURITIES
ARE NON-TOXIC

457
00:20:09,772 --> 00:20:12,308
"AND CAN BE REMOVED
BY FILTRATION."

458
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,711
SO ALL WE GOTTA DO NOW
IS FILTER THE WATER,

459
00:20:14,777 --> 00:20:16,279
AND POSSUM LAKE'LL
BE HEALTHY AGAIN.

460
00:20:16,312 --> 00:20:17,714
SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO
IS COME UP WITH A

461
00:20:17,747 --> 00:20:20,183
COST-EFFECTIVE, EFFICIENT
FILTRATION SYSTEM.

BRILLIANCE COMES IN.

WELL, I DON'T THINK
IT'S SO BRILLIANT.

NO, NO, BUT THEN,
YOU DIDN'T THINK
OF IT, DID YOU?

465
00:20:27,724 --> 00:20:29,325
ALL YOU COULD
THINK OF WAS

466
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:30,793
I THINK I'LL LIGHT
UP A CIGARETTE,

467
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,296
AND NOW NONE OF
US HAVE EYEBROWS.

468
00:20:35,031 --> 00:20:36,265
SO WHAT WE HAVE

469
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:40,136
IS THE BEST FILTER SYSTEM
ANYONE COULD EVER DEVISE.

TAKE ITS COURSE.

RIGHT THERE.
