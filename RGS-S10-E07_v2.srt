THAN HAVING TWO CARS

ESPECIALLY IF THEY BOTH RUN.

00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:09,509
AND WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT
TO HAVE A PLACE TO STORE THEM,

00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:12,645
EVEN IF ALL YOU HAD
WAS A SINGLE-CAR GARAGE?

5
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:15,915
WELL, ALL YOU NEED IS A
COUPLE OF PLAYGROUND
SLIDES LIKE THESE

00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,384
AND TWO SECTIONS OF THOSE

THEY HAVE AT THE BEER STORE.

YOU JUST DRIVE UP SO THAT
YOUR OUTSIDE WHEELS GO
UP THE SLIDES,

AND LET GRAVITY
TAKE CARE OF THE REST.

TO FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELT.

POSSUM LAKE CITY COUNCIL
HAS PASSED A NEW BY-LAW

FOR ANY LOCAL CLUB OR
ORGANIZATION OR LODGE

TO OPERATE WITHOUT A PERMIT.

THEY WON'T -- THEY'LL NEVER
GIVE US A PERMIT.

OF THE END RIGHT HERE.

WE'RE GONNA MAKE
A HEDGE WHACKER.

WILL ALLOW THE WHOLE UNIT

AND I'M USING
A FOUR-FOOT LENGTH

OF LEAD SINKERS TO ONE END
OF THE LINE.

00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:04,623
DOWN TO THE FAR END
OF THE HEDGE.

154
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:05,791
TIED HER OFF THERE.

155
00:07:05,857 --> 00:07:07,659
AND ON THIS END
I'VE GOT A FISH HOOK,

156
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:10,028
WHICH I JUST PUT INTO
THE LOWEST ROD GUIDE.

157
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:12,097
NOW WHEN THE ROD TURNS
INSIDE THE DRILL, SEE,

158
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,566
THE LINE WINDS UP, AND
IT PULLS THE WHOLE UNIT

159
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:16,301
THE WHOLE LENGTH
OF THE HEDGE.

160
00:07:16,368 --> 00:07:17,969
IS THAT GREAT OR WHAT?

161
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:20,272
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

162
00:07:20,305 --> 00:07:22,541
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

163
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:24,576
LET'S GIVE HER A TRY.

164
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:25,844
JUST LOCK THE DRILL
IN THE 'ON' POSITION,

165
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:28,680
AND STAND BACK,
STAND WELL BACK.

166
00:08:02,347 --> 00:08:03,815
I GOT A LETTER FROM A VIEWER.

167
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:05,250
SEEMED LIKE A NICE FELLA.

168
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:06,952
SAID HE'S NEVER
MISSED AN EPISODE.

169
00:08:07,018 --> 00:08:09,654
HE WANTED ME TO DO ONE OF THESE
TALKS ABOUT MEMORY LOSS.

170
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:11,323
I DIDN'T HAVE
THE HEART TO TELL HIM

171
00:08:11,356 --> 00:08:13,425
I'VE DONE THREE OR FOUR
OF 'EM ALREADY.

172
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:16,661
SO HERE GOES ANOTHER ONE.

173
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:19,764
APPARENTLY,
DOING CROSSWORD PUZZLES

174
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:22,133
WILL PREVENT MEMORY LOSS.

175
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,402
I HEARD THAT SOMEWHERE.
CAN'T REMEMBER WHERE.

176
00:08:24,436 --> 00:08:26,371
ANYWAY, I THOUGHT I'D
GIVE IT A TRY.

177
00:08:26,404 --> 00:08:28,440
SO LAST NIGHT, BERNICE WAS
GONNA BE HOME A BIT LATE.

178
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:30,775
SHE ASKED ME TO PUT
THE POTATOES ON TO BOIL
BEFORE SHE GOT THERE.

179
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:32,777
SO I DID THAT, THEN I
WENT INTO THE LIVING ROOM

180
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:34,913
AND STARTED ON
A CROSSWORD PUZZLE.

181
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:37,449
NEXT THING YOU KNOW, I'M KINDA
GAZING OFF THINKING,

182
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:39,918
BOY, I USED TO KNOW THAT WORD.

183
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:43,989
THEN I HEARD THE SMOKE ALARM
GO OFF IN THE KITCHEN.

184
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:48,193
THEN I REALISED THAT CROSSWORDS
DON'T PREVENT MEMORY LOSS,

185
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,328
THEY CONFIRM IT.

186
00:08:50,395 --> 00:08:52,697
SO I SAY DON'T WORRY
ABOUT YOUR MEMORY.

187
00:08:52,764 --> 00:08:54,899
AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A
WALLET AND A TACKLE BOX,

188
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:58,136
ANYTHING YOU WANT YOU
CAN EITHER BUY OR FISH FOR.

189
00:08:58,203 --> 00:08:59,838
AND THE ONLY WORD
YOU NEED TO REMEMBER

190
00:08:59,904 --> 00:09:01,673
ARE THE ONES YOU USE
TO EXPLAIN TO YOUR WIFE

191
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,309
HOW YOU BURNED HER
BEST POT BOILING POTATOES.

192
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:05,777
AND THOSE WORDS ARE,

193
00:09:05,844 --> 00:09:08,780
"THAT'S WHAT YOU GET
FOR ASKING ME TO COOK."

194
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,116
AND THERE'S ONE OTHER THING
YOU NEED TO REMEMBER...

195
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:13,718
I'M PULLING FOR YOU.
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

196
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:15,920
[ APPLAUSE ]

197
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:19,657
HI, WINSTON ROTHSCHILD HERE

198
00:09:19,724 --> 00:09:22,394
OF ROTHSCHILD'S SEWAGE AND
SEPTIC SUCKING SERVICES.

199
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,664
CALL ME WHEN YOUR BUSINESS
ISN'T GOING DOWN THE DRAIN.

200
00:09:32,003 --> 00:09:34,038
WELL, WE'RE STILL TRYING
TO PROVE THE LODGE
IS OLD ENOUGH

201
00:09:34,072 --> 00:09:36,107
TO AVOID THE
WRECKING BALL.

202
00:09:36,174 --> 00:09:38,143
OLD MAN SEDGWICK OFFERED
TO HELP US OUT.

203
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:39,978
HE SAYS HE REMEMBERS
COMING TO THE LODGE

204
00:09:40,044 --> 00:09:41,613
WHEN HE WAS JUST
A LITTLE KID.

205
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,148
HE'S NOT VERY
CONVINCING, THOUGH,

206
00:09:43,214 --> 00:09:46,718
BECAUSE HE SAYS AT
THE TIME HE WAS
A LITTLE GIRL.

207
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:49,554
SO INSTEAD, WE'RE GONNA
TAKE SOME ARTIFACTS
DOWN THERE.

208
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:52,123
I'VE GOT THE ORIGINAL
POSSUM LODGE MAIL BOX.

209
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,825
I FIGURE THE DATES
ON SOME OF THESE BILLS

210
00:09:53,858 --> 00:09:55,960
MIGHT PROVE
SHE'S KINDA OLD.

211
00:09:56,027 --> 00:09:57,762
I DON'T THINK THEY
GO BACK FAR ENOUGH.

212
00:09:57,796 --> 00:09:59,597
BUT THIS LOG
MIGHT DO THE TRICK.

213
00:09:59,631 --> 00:10:01,266
I PULLED IT OUT
OF THE LODGE FOUNDATION.

214
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:03,034
IT GOES
BACK A WHILE.

215
00:10:03,868 --> 00:10:05,303
WOW.

216
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,804
THAT'S PRETTY SPONGY.

217
00:10:06,838 --> 00:10:09,474
YEAH, IT TAKES A LONG TIME
TO GET THAT ROTTEN.

218
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:12,310
THEY USED TO SAY THAT
ABOUT MY GRANDFATHER.

219
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:15,580
WAIT A MINUTE,

220
00:10:15,613 --> 00:10:17,849
ISN'T THERE A KIND OF
ULTRA-VIOLET SCANNER

221
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,584
THEY PUT ON THINGS TO
TELL HOW OLD THEY ARE?

222
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:20,919
HEY, THAT'S RIGHT!

223
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:22,287
THE LOCAL COPS HAVE GOT ONE.

224
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,489
I ALWAYS WANTED TO TRY IT
OUT ON TINA TURNER.

225
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:27,825
WHY DON'T WE JUST GET
THE OLDEST THING
AT THE LODGE

226
00:10:27,892 --> 00:10:29,494
AND TAKE IT DOWN THERE
AND GET IT TESTED?

227
00:10:29,561 --> 00:10:30,762
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

228
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:32,497
WHAT'S THE OLDEST
PART OF THE LODGE?

229
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:34,232
WELL, I WOULD SAY
THE FRONT DOOR.

230
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:35,833
WHERE'S THE FRONT DOOR?

231
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,602
IT'S AT THE BACK.
OH.

232
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:45,009
RED! RED GREEN!

233
00:10:45,043 --> 00:10:46,377
WELCOME.

234
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:48,246
YOU ARE WELCOME HERE, SIR.
YEAH. ALL RIGHT.

235
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:50,315
I BROUGHT YOU
A NEWSPAPER.

236
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:54,385
OH, FOR THE
HAMSTER CAGE, HUH?

237
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,155
WELL, THANKS ANYWAY,

238
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:59,257
BUT HOWARD DIDN'T
HAVE A VERY GOOD WEEK.

239
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,026
OH, NO, YOU DIDN'T
EAT HIM, DID YOU, GORD?

240
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:06,197
NO, I LET HIM OUT
OF HIS CAGE

241
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:07,899
SO THAT HE COULD
PLAY AROUND A BIT.

242
00:11:07,932 --> 00:11:09,901
THEN I PUT HIM ON
TOP OF THE RAILING

243
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:11,602
SO HE COULD SEE
THE FOREST BETTER,

244
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:14,038
AND --

245
00:11:15,907 --> 00:11:18,176
I GUESS HE MUST
HAVE SLIPPED.

246
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,412
HAMSTERS CAN'T FLY,
CAN THEY?

247
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:25,283
HE DID FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

248
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,952
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY, GORD.

249
00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:30,088
OKAY, WELL, CHEER UP.

250
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:32,523
ACTUALLY, THAT'S NOT
WHAT THE NEWSPAPER'S FOR.

251
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,025
NO?
NO. NO.

252
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:36,327
UH, DO YOU KNOW WHAT
PERSONAL ADs ARE, GORD?

253
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,929
OH, BOY, YEAH.

254
00:11:37,995 --> 00:11:39,497
WHOA!

255
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:43,734
I DIDN'T THINK SO.
OKAY --

256
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:45,903
PERSONAL ADs ARE A
WAY TO USE THE NEWSPAPER

257
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,139
TO MEET WOMEN.

258
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:49,941
I'M LOVING THIS ALREADY.

259
00:11:49,974 --> 00:11:51,309
SEE WHAT IT SAYS THERE?

260
00:11:51,342 --> 00:11:53,478
"SINGLE WOMEN
SEEKING SINGLE MEN."

261
00:11:53,511 --> 00:11:55,379
HOW DO I MEET
THESE WOMEN?

262
00:11:55,413 --> 00:11:57,148
WELL, NO, YOU DON'T WANT
TO MEET JUST ANY WOMAN.

263
00:11:57,181 --> 00:11:59,150
OH, YES, I DO.

264
00:11:59,183 --> 00:12:03,120
YOU WANNA FIND THAT ONE
SPECIAL WOMAN TO BOND WITH.

265
00:12:03,187 --> 00:12:04,889
BOND!

266
00:12:04,922 --> 00:12:06,724
IS THAT WHAT THEY'RE
CALLING IT NOWADAYS?

267
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,593
GUESS I'VE BEEN
OUT OF TOUCH, HUH?

268
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:10,161
WELL, YEAH, YOU HAVE.

269
00:12:10,228 --> 00:12:11,963
BUT YOU'VE GOTTA THINK
ABOUT WHAT KIND OF
WOMAN DO YOU LIKE?

270
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:13,764
OH, WELL, LET ME SEE.

271
00:12:13,831 --> 00:12:15,399
UH, AGE IS IMPORTANT.

272
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:17,268
SHE HAS TO BE OVER 21

273
00:12:17,335 --> 00:12:19,870
AND UNDER 100.

274
00:12:19,937 --> 00:12:21,973
UH, OH, SHE CAN'T
BE AFRAID OF HEIGHTS.

275
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:24,375
AND, UH, NO,
I GUESS THAT'S ABOUT IT.

276
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:26,110
SO HOW DO I
MEET THESE WOMEN?

277
00:12:26,143 --> 00:12:29,847
WELL, I GUESS YOU JUST PHONE
UP THE ONES WHO PUT THEIR
NUMBERS ON THEIR ADs.

278
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,248
REALLY?
YEAH.

279
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:32,950
I'D TALK TO A REAL,
LIVE WOMAN,

280
00:12:32,984 --> 00:12:34,652
NOT A RECORDING?

281
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:36,454
I'D SAY, HELLO,
THIS IS RANGER GORD.

282
00:12:36,487 --> 00:12:38,289
I WAS JUST WONDERING IF WE
COULD GET MARRIED SOME TIME.

283
00:12:39,624 --> 00:12:42,159
UM, YOU MIGHT WANT TO
LET THEM DO THE TALKING.

284
00:12:42,226 --> 00:12:44,428
YEAH, YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

285
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:46,130
PLAY HARD TO GET, HUH?

286
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:48,265
I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO GET
MARRIED AND SETTLE DOWN ANYWAYS.

287
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:51,836
NEXT THING YOU KNOW, THEY'D BE
ASKING ME TO GET RID OF MY
IMAGINARY GIRLFRIENDS.

288
00:12:51,902 --> 00:12:54,705
OH, LIKE, AS IF.

289
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,676
UH, YOU KNOW, GORD, THIS MIGHT
BE A BETTER AD FOR YOU.

290
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:00,945
"HAMSTER, FREE TO GOOD HOME."

291
00:13:00,978 --> 00:13:03,214
WHAT'S THE NUMBER?
GIVE ME THE NUMBER.

292
00:13:06,317 --> 00:13:09,120
Red: WINSTON AND WALTER
CALLED ME OUT TO THE
BASEBALL DIAMOND.

293
00:13:09,186 --> 00:13:10,888
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANTED

294
00:13:10,955 --> 00:13:13,124
THEY WERE GONNA SET UP
A HOME RUN CONTEST

295
00:13:13,157 --> 00:13:14,859
BETWEEN THE TWO OF 'EM.

296
00:13:14,892 --> 00:13:17,027
PRETTY AMBITIOUS SCHEDULE,
I WOULD SAY,

297
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:18,796
IF YOU'RE GONNA GET
THAT MANY HOME RUNS.

298
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:20,798
I GOTTA BE HOME BY CHRISTMAS.

299
00:13:20,831 --> 00:13:23,667
THEY WANTED ME TO BE THE JUDGE
STAND OUT BY THE FENCE.

300
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:27,104
CATCH ANY
ERRANT BALLS, I GUESS.

301
00:13:27,438 --> 00:13:29,140
OH, THEY'RE GONNA FLIP A COIN
WINSTON WANTED TO FLIP A COIN

302
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:30,541
AND SEE WHO WOULD GO FIRST.

303
00:13:30,574 --> 00:13:32,009
SO I SAID, "FINE."

304
00:13:32,076 --> 00:13:34,512

AND A THERMOSTAT AND A SPOUT
IN THE BOTTOM OF HER THERE,

WATER GETS HOT ENOUGH,

NEVER LOSE FAITH.

WHENEVER THE LORD
CLOSES A WINDOW,

462
00:20:05,168 --> 00:20:07,470
HE'LL OFTEN BLOW OFF
A FRONT DOOR.

463
00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:11,674
WELL, WE HAD THE
DOOR ANALYSED,

464
00:20:11,741 --> 00:20:15,044
HOPING WE COULD SAVE
THE LODGE FROM BEING
TORN DOWN.

465
00:20:15,078 --> 00:20:17,513
YEAH, HAD A COMPLETE

THEY DIDN'T EVEN GET
THAT FROM THE TEST.

468
00:20:22,318 --> 00:20:25,288
THE PRICE TAG
WAS STILL ON THE DOOR.

469

SAID POSSUM LAKE LUMBER, 1952.

470
00:20:28,091 --> 00:20:29,892
I PHONED OVER TO
MAKE SURE THAT WAS THE DATE

471
00:20:29,926 --> 00:20:31,461
NOT JUST THE PRICE.

472
00:20:31,494 --> 00:20:32,795
IT WAS THE DATE.

473
00:20:32,862 --> 00:20:34,964
YEAH, WE STILL
OWE THEM THE PRICE.

474
00:20:35,031 --> 00:20:36,632
BUT HERE'S
THE GOOD NEWS.

475
00:20:36,699 --> 00:20:39,902
THE CHEMICAL ANALYSIS SHOWED
THAT THE LODGE IS FULL OF
ASBESTOS

476
00:20:39,936 --> 00:20:44,741
AND P.C.B.s AND CARCINOGENS THEY
HADN'T EVEN THOUGHT OF YET.

477
00:20:44,807 --> 00:20:46,242
IF THEY TEAR THE LODGE DOWN,

478
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:47,810
ALL THAT STUFF
GOES INTO THE GROUND.

479
00:20:47,877 --> 00:20:49,946
IT'LL BE AN
ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER.

480
00:20:49,979 --> 00:20:52,982
SO CITY COUNCIL RULED TO
PRESERVE THE LODGE

481
00:20:53,015 --> 00:20:55,685
BECAUSE IT'D BE TOO
DANGEROUS TO WRECK IT.

482
00:20:55,718 --> 00:20:57,720
IS THIS OUR
LUCKY DAY, OR WHAT?

YOU GO AHEAD, MIKE.
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:11,400
SHOULD I TAKE
THIS AS A DOOR PRIZE?

NO. NO.

WELL, THAT'S IT FOR
OUR SHOW --

490

DON'T SLAM THE DOOR.

I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

493

AND I KIND OF LEARNED THAT
WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF
THE OLD THINGS.

494
00:21:25,047 --> 00:21:26,782
WE'VE GOT TO
TREASURE OUR ANTIQUES,

ESPECIALLY IF
THEY'RE EACH OTHER,

WITH THE FURNITURE OIL.
