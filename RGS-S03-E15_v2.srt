WHAT'S A POWER HAMMER

172
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:14,113
YOU'RE ASKING?

173
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:14,813
WELL A POWER HAMMER IS

174
00:05:14,813 --> 00:05:15,714
BASICALLY A GUN THAT

175
00:05:15,714 --> 00:05:18,884
FIRES NAILS.

176
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:19,918
YOU'VE GOT TO LOVE A TOOL

177
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:22,054
THAT USES GUN POWDER DON'T YOU?

178
00:05:22,054 --> 00:05:23,322
WELL LET'S START BY CUTTING

179
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:25,257
UP THE 2 BY 4'S

180
00:05:25,257 --> 00:05:27,259
I LOVE THE SMELL OF FRESH PINE.

181
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:27,960
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU GET

182
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,897
THEM ALL THE SAME LENGTH

183
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:34,366
AND HERE WE GO,

184
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:39,671
OH FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!

185
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:55,554
(SAW WHINING & LABOURING)

186
00:05:55,554 --> 00:05:58,090
THERE WE GO AND THERE WE GO,

187
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:58,924
BOY THAT SMELLS GOOD

188
00:05:58,924 --> 00:05:59,825
DOESN'T IT HUH?

189
00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:02,628
NOW GOLLY MAYBE I SHOULD

190
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,397
HAVE MEASURED THOSE FIRST

191
00:06:05,397 --> 00:06:06,465
YOU KNOW WHY DON'T I CUT

192
00:06:06,465 --> 00:06:07,266
THOSE AGAIN.

193
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,033
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT,

194
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:09,168
LET'S START AGAIN.

195
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:10,903
OKAY THIS TIME EVEN UP

196
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,237
THE ENDS 'CAUSE YOU WANT THEM

197
00:06:12,237 --> 00:06:14,373
ALL TO BE EXACTLY THE SAME

198
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:15,474
LENGTH THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT

199
00:06:15,474 --> 00:06:21,113
OF IT AND I GUESS THEY

200
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:23,549
WERE THE SAME LENGTH.

201
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,483
OH WELL WE'LL JUST BUILD

202
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:25,250
A SHORTER WALL NOW THAT'S OKAY

203
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:25,984
BECAUSE THE WALLS IN THE

204
00:06:25,984 --> 00:06:36,995
BASEMENT ARE REAL SHORT ANYWAY.

205
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:42,634
(SAW WHINING)

206
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:45,003
OKAY NOW THESE ARE YOUR

207
00:06:45,003 --> 00:06:46,138
UPRIGHTS OR AT LEAST THEY

208
00:06:46,138 --> 00:06:47,439
WILL BE WHEN THEY'RE UPRIGHT

209
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,775
AND YOU CUT THESE SO THAT

210
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:51,610
THEY'RE EXACTLY THE SAME

211
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,578
HEIGHT AS YOUR CEILING

212
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:56,949
MINUS 3 INCHES.

213
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,116
OKAY JUST LIKE HAROLD'S CAREER

214
00:06:58,116 --> 00:06:59,785
WE'RE GOING TO START AT THE

215
00:06:59,785 --> 00:07:00,786
BOTTOM THE ONLY DIFFERENCE

216
00:07:00,786 --> 00:07:02,821
BEING WE'RE GOING SOMEWHERE.

217
00:07:02,821 --> 00:07:03,689
OKAY THIS HERE IS WHAT

218
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:04,690
I CALL A FOOTER ACTUALLY

219
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,259
IT'S A 3 FOOTER AND WE'RE

220
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:08,226
GOING TO ANCHOR THIS TO

221
00:07:08,226 --> 00:07:09,895
THE FLOOR USING

222
00:07:09,895 --> 00:07:11,863
THE POWER HAMMER.

223
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:13,498
YOU KNOW ACTUALLY THESE

224
00:07:13,498 --> 00:07:14,700
UNITS USE THE SAME CARTRIDGE

225
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,336
AS A 22 CALIBER RIFLE,

226
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,170
YOU COULD GO HUNTING WITH

227
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,237
ONE OF THESE POWER HAMMERS

228
00:07:19,237 --> 00:07:20,138
YEAH YOU COULD GET YOURSELF

229
00:07:20,138 --> 00:07:21,073
A DEER AND TACK HIS HIDE

230
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:26,111
TO THE TREE ALL IN THE ONE GO.

231
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:30,482
ALRIGHT THAT'LL BE ENOUGH

232
00:07:30,482 --> 00:07:31,483
AND YOU POP THESE IN THE

233
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:32,217
BACK HERE AND THEN YOU

234
00:07:32,217 --> 00:07:33,852
JUST PUT HER IN PLACE

235
00:07:33,852 --> 00:07:34,986
PUSH HER DOWN AND

236
00:07:34,986 --> 00:07:35,854
LET HER GO.

237
00:07:35,854 --> 00:07:38,557
(LOUD RICOCHET OF HAMMER GUN)

238
00:07:38,557 --> 00:07:39,424
DID I MENTION EAR

239
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:42,461
PROTECTION AT ALL?

240
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:43,195
YOU REALLY WANT TO USE

241
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:44,062
EAR PROTECTION WITH THIS

242
00:07:44,062 --> 00:07:44,896
EAR PROTECTION IS PRETTY

243
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:46,865
WELL A MUST.

244
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:47,699
SO THIS IS GOING TO TAKE

245
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:48,467
A WHILE SO WHY DON'T YOU

246
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:49,367
GO BACK TO THE SHOW

247
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:50,335
I'LL KEEP BUILDING AND WE'LL

248
00:07:50,335 --> 00:07:51,570

00:07:52,437 --> 00:07:54,439
GET THAT PHONE?

251
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:58,710

AGAIN WHERE WE EXPOSE THOSE

253
00:08:00,278 --> 00:08:01,580
3 LITTLE WORDS THAT MEN

254
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,614
HAVE SUCH DIFFICULTY SAYING

255
00:08:02,614 --> 00:08:05,684
'I DON'T KNOW'.

256
00:08:05,684 --> 00:08:06,551
AND HERE TO PROVE THAT POINT

NOT BE AS GOOD AS I THINK I AM.

266

EXACTLY HOW DO YOU TELL IF

267
00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:35,280
YOU'RE A BAD DRIVER OR NOT?'

I AM YOUR MAN, I MUST RUN

276
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:46,224
INTO ONE OR 2 OF THOSE SUCKERS

277

HEAD ON ONCE A MONTH.

00:08:49,628 --> 00:08:50,762
YEAH BUT LISTEN LET'S START

279
00:08:50,762 --> 00:08:51,963
RIGHT AT THE VERY VERY BEGINNING

280
00:08:51,963 --> 00:08:53,164
OF WHERE THE PROBLEM LIES

281

I BLAME IN ON YOUR DRIVER

282
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:55,867
EDUCATION SYSTEM.

DOUG I AGREE 100 PERCENT.

285
00:08:57,869 --> 00:08:58,970
>>DOUGIE: ABSOLUTELY

286
00:08:58,970 --> 00:08:59,804
I MEAN YOU KNOW A KID

287
00:08:59,804 --> 00:09:00,972
SPENDS 4 YEARS IN SCHOOL

288
00:09:00,972 --> 00:09:02,240
LEARNING HOW TO CONTROL

289
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,441
A PENCIL WHICH HAS NO MOVING

290
00:09:03,441 --> 00:09:04,976
PARTS GOES ABOUT ONE MILE

291
00:09:04,976 --> 00:09:06,244
AN HOUR AND IS NOT KNOWN

292
00:09:06,244 --> 00:09:07,178
TO BURST INTO FLAMES

293
00:09:07,178 --> 00:09:10,415
WHEN SHE ROLLS.

294
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:11,383
WHAT I'M SAYING HERE IS

295
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:12,450
WE'RE NOT TEACHING OUR KIDS

296
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,752
RIGHT AND HOW CAN WE?

297
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:14,953
YOU KNOW I MEAN THESE TEACHERS

298
00:09:14,953 --> 00:09:16,388
ARE TALKING THEORY,

299
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:17,322
YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW

300
00:09:17,322 --> 00:09:18,790
TO DO SOMETHING GO TO

301
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,191
SOMEBODY WHOSE BEEN THERE

302
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:22,260
GO TO HELL AND BACK AND TELL

303
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,262
THE STORY LIKE MY FAMILY

304
00:09:24,262 --> 00:09:24,996
WE HAVE HAD EVERY TYPE

305
00:09:24,996 --> 00:09:29,167
OF ACCIDENT IMAGINABLE.

306
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:30,602
WE HAVE HAD YOUR HEAD ON

307
00:09:30,602 --> 00:09:31,870
YOUR REAR ENDER

308
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,171
YOUR SIDE SWIPE

309
00:09:33,171 --> 00:09:34,172
YOUR ROLLOVER

310
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:36,207
YOUR ROLLOVER WITH A CONVERTIBLE

311
00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:38,209
YOU NAME IT, WE HAVE DONE

312
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:39,010
THEM ALL.

313
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,745
WE SHOULD BE TEACHING THE KIDS,

314
00:09:40,745 --> 00:09:41,746
YOU PUT ME, MY BROTHER AND

315
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:45,083
MY DADDY IN FRONT OF A

316
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,218
CLASSROOM AND I GUARANTEE YOU

317
00:09:47,218 --> 00:09:49,053
YOU WILL BRING DOWN THE NUMBER

318
00:09:49,053 --> 00:09:53,358
OF BAD DRIVERS ON THE ROAD.

319
00:09:53,358 --> 00:09:57,428
>>RED: YEAH BY 3.

320
00:09:59,564 --> 00:10:00,965
>>RED: WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO

321
00:10:00,965 --> 00:10:02,100
DO IS ATTACH THIS PART

322
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,369
OF THE WALL TO THE FOOTER

323
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:05,336
BY NAILING NAILS UP THROUGH

324
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:10,675
FROM UNDERNEATH.

325
00:10:10,675 --> 00:10:11,409
ALRIGHT IF YOU'RE DOING

326
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:13,211
THIS I WOULD SUGGEST THAT

327
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:15,280
YOU NAIL THIS PART ONTO THE

328
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,014
FOOTER BEFORE YOU ATTACH

329
00:10:16,014 --> 00:10:17,715
IT TO THE FLOOR

330
00:10:17,715 --> 00:10:19,250
THAT'S AN EXCELLENT TIP.

331
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,351
ANYWAY YOU GET THE IDEA

332
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:21,286
SO UNTIL NEXT TIME REMEMBER

333
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:22,987
IF THE WOMEN DON'T FIND YOU

334
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:24,689
HANDSOME THEY SHOULD AT

335
00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:27,659
LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

336
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:28,560
YOU KNOW WHAT I COULD

337
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,561
DO WITH THIS IS JUST GO DOWN

338
00:10:29,561 --> 00:10:31,930
TO THE BASEMENT AND JUST

339
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:32,764
KEEP FIRING NAILS UNTIL

340
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:37,268

341
00:10:37,268 --> 00:10:38,369

342
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:39,938

TO GROW A LITTLE FASTER

401
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:51,576

00:11:57,849 --> 00:11:59,851
THE TOP BRANCHES OFF

408
00:11:59,851 --> 00:12:01,819

THAT WELL ON TELEVISION.

418
00:12:24,742 --> 00:12:25,910
>>RED: WELL THIS IDEA OF RAISING

419
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,545
MONEY WITH A FUNNY HOME VIDEO

420
00:12:27,545 --> 00:12:28,446
HAS TURNED INTO A KIND OF

421
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:30,781
GOOD NEWS/BAD NEWS THING.

422
00:12:30,781 --> 00:12:31,549

FAMILY FUNCTIONS BY PUTTING

430
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:44,195
UNDERWEAR ON HIS HEAD,

431
00:12:44,195 --> 00:12:44,929

WELL THE FUNNY PART IS

481
00:13:52,763 --> 00:13:53,631
YOU CAN'T GET THE NUTS

482
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:57,568
OR THE RAISINS OUT.

483
00:13:57,568 --> 00:13:58,302
>>RED: OH SO WE

484
00:13:58,302 --> 00:13:59,470
HAVE NO CAMERA.

485
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:05,743
>>RED: AT THIS TIME, NO.

486
00:14:08,012 --> 00:14:08,646
>>RED: TODAY'S

487
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:09,480
'ADVENTURES WITH BILL'

488
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,147
BILL IS GONG TO TEACH ME

489
00:14:10,147 --> 00:14:11,081
HOW TO DO A LITTLE DOWNHILL

490
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:12,082
SKIING SOMETHING I'VE NEVER

491
00:14:12,082 --> 00:14:13,651
DONE AND I THINK BILL IS

492
00:14:13,651 --> 00:14:15,286
PRIMARILY A TEACHER.

493
00:14:15,286 --> 00:14:16,720
NOW THIS WAS INTERESTING

494
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,622
IN ORDER TO SAVE TIME

495
00:14:18,622 --> 00:14:20,324
HE HAD ACTUALLY PUT HIS SKIS

496
00:14:20,324 --> 00:14:21,225
ON BEFORE HE CAME OUT OF

497
00:14:21,225 --> 00:14:23,460
MY VAN TO DO THE SKIING.

498
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,662
SO I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING

499
00:14:24,662 --> 00:14:25,562
I GUESS IT WILL TAKE QUITE

500
00:14:25,562 --> 00:14:26,497
A WHILE TO GET THE SKIS ON

501
00:14:26,497 --> 00:14:27,665
AND WHAT HAVE YOU BUT YOU KNOW

502
00:14:27,665 --> 00:14:29,333
I'M NOT REALLY SURE EXACTLY

503
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,101
HOW MUCH TIME THIS SAVED

504
00:14:31,101 --> 00:14:32,536
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE.

505
00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:35,673
ANYWAYS THERE HE IS ALRIGHT

506
00:14:35,673 --> 00:14:36,507
ALRIGHT BUT YOU KNOW AND

507
00:14:36,507 --> 00:14:37,508
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU

508
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:38,375
TEACH YOUR STUDENTS AND THEN

509
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,177
I GUESS HAVE THE CHOICE OF

510
00:14:40,177 --> 00:14:41,645
EITHER DOING WHAT YOU SAY OR

511
00:14:41,645 --> 00:14:43,047
PICKING A BETTER WAY,

512
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:43,847
I THINK I MIGHT I GO WITH

513
00:14:43,847 --> 00:14:44,815
A DIFFERENT WAY ON THIS

514
00:14:44,815 --> 00:14:47,451
BUT AGAIN I'M RECEPTIVE

515
00:14:47,451 --> 00:14:49,153
BILL KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING HERE

516
00:14:49,153 --> 00:14:50,754
AND NOW WE GO AND THEN.

517
00:14:50,754 --> 00:14:52,189
>>BILL: OH!

518
00:14:52,189 --> 00:14:53,090
>>RED: OH HE'S CAUGHT NOW

519
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,024
THERE'S ANOTHER THING YOU SEE

520
00:14:54,024 --> 00:14:54,925
HE'S SHOWING THE EXAMPLE OF

521
00:14:54,925 --> 00:14:55,793
WHAT CAN GO WRONG

522
00:14:55,793 --> 00:14:59,096
I THINK THAT'S A VALUABLE LESSON

523
00:14:59,096 --> 00:14:59,830
OH THERE'S AN EXAMPLE THERE

524
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,031
AND THAT'S PROBABLY NOT

525
00:15:01,031 --> 00:15:03,100
SOMETHING YOU'D CHOOSE TO DO

526
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,601
BUT IF YOU SHOW IT TO THE

527
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:05,436
STUDENTS THAT'S THE MARK OF

528
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:07,071
AN EXCELLENT TEACHER.

529
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:07,971
ANYWAYS HE'S GOT LOTS MORE

530
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:09,239
SKIS OUT IN THE VAN AND

531
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:12,543
A LOT OF POLES, OH! OH!

532
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:13,644
NOW THAT WAS A SAFETY LESSON

533
00:15:13,644 --> 00:15:14,645
AND YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE I'LL

534
00:15:14,645 --> 00:15:16,680
REMEMBER FOR QUITE A WHILE.

535
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,017
BILL'S GOOD THAT WAY,

536
00:15:20,017 --> 00:15:20,818
NOW YOU'VE GOT AN AWFUL

537
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:24,121
LOT OF POLES THERE BILL

538
00:15:24,121 --> 00:15:28,325
YEAH I'LL TAKE THAT AND THEN

539
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:29,293
OH WELL I GUESS HE KNOWS

540
00:15:29,293 --> 00:15:30,160
WHAT HE'S DOING.

541
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,161
NOW HE PUTS THEM DOWN

542
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:34,164
LIKE JEAN CLAUDE KILLEY

543
00:15:34,164 --> 00:15:36,033
YEAH YEAH ALRIGHT ALRIGHT

544
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:38,168
NO TIPPING!

545
00:15:38,168 --> 00:15:39,303
ANYWAY NOW HE'S SHOWING

546
00:15:39,303 --> 00:15:41,171
ME HOW TO GET THE SHOES HAVE

547
00:15:41,171 --> 00:15:44,942
THE HOLES IN THEM WITH THOSE

548
00:15:44,942 --> 00:15:45,976
LITTLE PINS AND THE PINS

549
00:15:45,976 --> 00:15:47,244
LINEUP WITH THE HOLES IN

550
00:15:47,244 --> 00:15:48,045
THE SPECIAL CROSS COUNTRY

551
00:15:48,045 --> 00:15:48,812
SKI THINGS THEN HE CLIPS

552
00:15:48,812 --> 00:15:49,646
THAT DOWN, NO DOWN THERE.

553
00:15:49,646 --> 00:15:50,480
HE'S SHOWING US WHAT CAN

554
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,415
GO WRONG, ACTUALLY I WASN'T

555
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:55,452
PAYING THAT MUCH ATTENTION AT

556
00:15:55,452 --> 00:15:56,386
THIS POINT I WAS JUST TRYING

557
00:15:56,386 --> 00:15:57,254
TO USE SOME LOGIC AND

558
00:15:57,254 --> 00:15:58,222
COMMON SENSE.

559
00:15:58,222 --> 00:15:59,289
I WAS GETTING MINE ON ALRIGHT

560
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:02,492
I GUESS MAYBE THAT IS AN

561
00:16:02,492 --> 00:16:03,260
EFFECTIVE WAY TO TEACH

562
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,161
HE SHOWS YOU THE WRONG WAY

563
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:06,630
AND THEN YOU KIND OF YOU

564
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,099
KNOW YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT

565
00:16:09,099 --> 00:16:09,900
AND I WAS YEAH YOU'RE DOING

566
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,701
FINE AND I WAS FEELING REAL

567
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:11,468
GOOD AND I THOUGHT THIS MIGHT

568
00:16:11,468 --> 00:16:12,436
BE AN INTERESTING WAY TO

569
00:16:12,436 --> 00:16:17,507
MEET SWEDISH WOMEN TOO.

570
00:16:17,507 --> 00:16:18,275
AND HE'S MOVING ALONG THERE

571
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:19,309
I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THIS

572
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:21,211
WAS ABOUT I GUESS HE WAS JUST

573
00:16:21,211 --> 00:16:23,547
KIND OF MARKING HIS PATH WHAT

574
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:24,581
HAVE YOU BUT I GUESS THIS

575
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:25,282
WOULD EXPLAIN WHY ALL THE

576
00:16:25,282 --> 00:16:26,049
POLES WERE THERE BUT AS I

577
00:16:26,049 --> 00:16:27,017
SAID I WAS LOOKING MORE

578
00:16:27,017 --> 00:16:28,251
FOR THE SWEDES!

579
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:29,586
ANYWAY THE STEEP HILLS

580
00:16:29,586 --> 00:16:31,121
BOY THEY ARE A CHALLENGE

581
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:32,489
THAT'S A TOUGH ONE.

582
00:16:32,489 --> 00:16:33,290
HE WAS USING THE POLES

583
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,057
TO KIND OF...

584
00:16:34,057 --> 00:16:34,725
NOW AGAIN I THINK AS

585
00:16:34,725 --> 00:16:35,625
A TEACHER HE WAS SHOWING

586
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,261
US ALL THAT THINGS CAN GO WRONG,

587
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:39,162
I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO

588
00:16:39,162 --> 00:16:40,263
SLIDE ALL THE WAY BACK TO

589
00:16:40,263 --> 00:16:41,798
THE BEGINNING OF THE COURSE.

590
00:16:41,798 --> 00:16:42,699
>>BILL: AH!

591
00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:44,234
>>RED: NO HE GOT LUCKY THERE.

592
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:45,502
HE'S SO SMART AND THEN

593
00:16:45,502 --> 00:16:46,503
I'M GOING ALONG AND ALL OF

594
00:16:46,503 --> 00:16:48,138
A SUDDEN I HEAR A NOISE

595
00:16:48,138 --> 00:16:49,106
AND I'M THINKING WHAT'S

596
00:16:49,106 --> 00:16:49,940
THE TEACHER SHOWING US?

597
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,774
WELL FOR GOSH SAKES

598
00:16:50,774 --> 00:16:51,775
THE TEACHER'S GOT A SENSE

599
00:16:51,775 --> 00:16:53,844
OF HUMOR BUT BILL THE VAN!

600
00:16:53,844 --> 00:16:56,580
THE VAN! BILL THE VAN!

601
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:00,484
>>BILL: OH!

602
00:17:00,484 --> 00:17:01,318
>>RED: OH WELL I LEARNED

603
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:02,586

609
00:17:09,626 --> 00:17:11,828
THAN I USED TO BE.

610
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:13,230
AS FAR AS THE TEACHER'S

611
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,331
CONCERNED IT LOOKS TO ME

612
00:17:14,331 --> 00:17:17,134
LIKE IT'S CLASS DISMISSED

613
00:17:17,134 --> 00:17:19,703
