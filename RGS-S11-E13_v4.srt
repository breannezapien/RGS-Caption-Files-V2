1
00:00:01,901 --> 00:00:04,637
THIS GUY IS MY NEIGHBOR
BOB DINKINS FROM UP THE ROAD

2
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:06,206
NOW, I'VE JUST
GIVEN HIM A WATCH.

3
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:08,008
HE'S PRETTY
HAPPY ABOUT THAT.

4
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:10,110
HE THINKS IT'S
REAL NICE TO GET A GIFT.

5
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:13,246
I GUESS HE DOESN'T KNOW
MUCH ABOUT THE TROJAN WAR.

6
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,216
REMEMBER, BOB, DON'T PUT
IT ON UNTIL YOU GET HOME.

7
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:19,719
IF YOU HAVE A
NEIGHBOUR OR A RELATIVE

8
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:21,488
WHO KEEPS DROPPING IN
UNANNOUNCED

9
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,990
AND IS ALWAYS QUICK TO TELL
YOU WHAT YOU'RE DOING WRONG

10
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:28,328
OR YOU'RE AN IDIOT,
OR HE'S GONNA CALL THE COPS
UNLESS YOU GIVE HIM A BEER,

11
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,063
WELL, HERE'S WHAT YOU DO...

12
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,265
GET YOURSELF ONE OF THOSE
INVISIBLE FENCE UNITS

13
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:34,901
THAT YOU USE TO KEEP
YOUR DOG INSIDE YOUR YARD,

14
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:38,738
AND YOU BURY THE WIRE AROUND
THE WHOLE PERIMETER OF
YOUR PROPERTY.

15
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:41,808
THEN YOU PUT A SPECIAL COLLAR
ONTO YOUR DOG,

16
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,676
AND EVERY TIME HE GETS
NEAR THE BURIED WIRE,

17
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:45,912
HE GETS ZAPPED.

18
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,882
NOW, YOU MAY NOTICE THAT 'VE
TAKEN THE ZAPPER OUT OF
THIS COLLAR.

19
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:50,884
THAT'S BECAUSE I INSTALLED
IT INTO THAT WATCH

20
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:53,319
I JUST GAVE TO MY
ANNOYING NEIGHBOUR.

21
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:55,688
I FIGURE ANY SYSTEM
THAT CAN KEEP A DOG IN

22
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:58,491
SHOULD BE ABLE TO
KEEP A GOOF OUT.

23
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,561
BESIDES, THIS IS WAY TOO CRUEL
TO USE ON AN ANIMAL.

24
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:04,597
OKAY, HE'S OFF THE PROPERTY.

25
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:07,100
I THINK WE SHOULD ARM
THE PERIMETER.

26
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:11,104
OH, LOOK,
HE'S COMING BACK.

27
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:13,540
PROBABLY WANTS TO TELL ME
SOMETHING ELSE I DON'T
NEED TO KNOW.

28
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,375
[zapping sounds]

29
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:19,179
HEY, BOB!
CHECK YOUR WATCH.

30
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,114
LOOKS LIKE IT'S
PAYBACK TIME.

31
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:33,927
[cheers and applause]

32
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,596
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

33
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:39,199
WELL, I APPRECIATE THAT.

34
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,434
I GOTTA TELL YOU,

35
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:45,605
WE'VE HAD A REAL HOT ONE
GOIN' ON HERE TODAY.

36
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:47,540
I DON'T KNOW THE
EXACT TEMPERATURE,

37
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,143
BUT THE BASEMENT OF
THE LODGE IS DRY.

38
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,412
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED SINCE --

39
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,347
WELL, THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED.

40
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,249
[sniffing]

41
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,751
OKAY, I THINK I KNOW WHICH
BUILDING THIS SHINGLE
CAME OFF OF.

42
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,589
MERRY CHRISTMAS,
UNCLE RED!

43
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:04,090
MERRY CHRISTMAS!

44
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,625
CHRISTMAS MERRY!

45
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:07,193
MERRY CHRISTMAS!

46
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:11,431
I HOPE THAT'S
SUN STROKE, HAROLD.

47
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,867
OH, NO, I'M JUST TRYING
TO GET YOU IN THE SPIRIT

48
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:17,804
FOR OUR FIRST ANNUAL CHRISTMAS
IN JULY CELEBRATION!

49
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:21,174
OH, AND WHY WOULD
THIS BE A GOOD THING?

50
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,009
WELL, BECAUSE IT
BRINGS CROWDS.

51
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,644
IT BRINGS VISITORS
UP TO THE LODGE.

52
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,747
THEY'LL THINK, "POSSUM LAKE IS
HAVING CHRISTMAS IN JULY?

53
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,816
"THAT'S CRAZY.
LET'S GO!"

54
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,418
WHAT IF THEY THINK,
"THAT'S CRAZY.

55
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,587
"LET'S STAY AWAY IN DROVES"?

56
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:38,725
WELL, WE JUST GOTTA
KEEP PUTTING OUT THAT
CHRISTMAS CHEER, DON'T WE?

57
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:41,528
WE'LL HAVE TO GET EVERY CYNIC
TO JOIN HAND IN HAND AND SAY,

58
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,463
"I DON'T CARE
IF IT IS JULY.

59
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,434
"I WISH EVERYONE THE BEST,
MERRIEST CHRISTMAS EVER!"

60
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:52,038
BOY, I HOPE YOUR MEDICAL
INSURANCE IS PAID UP.

61
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,740
I NEED YOUR HELP --

62
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,576
I NEED YOUR HELP BECAUSE THE
LODGE IS A BIG PART OF
CHRISTMAS AROUND HERE.

63
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,913
SO YOU KNOW HOW YOU PUT THOSE
LIGHTS AROUND THE LODGE
AS CHRISTMAS TIME?

64
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,749
I NEED YOU TO DO
THAT AGAIN, RIGHT NOW.

65
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,784
GET THE FESTIVE
MOOD STARTED.

66
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,253
ALL RIGHT, SURE.
SURE, THAT'S FINE.

67
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,155
NO COMPLAINING?
NO ARGUING?

68
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,824
THAT'S IT?
I ASKED YOU TO PUT
LIGHTS ALL AROUND THE LODGE.

69
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,194
AND YOU'RE GONNA
GO ALONG WITH IT?

70
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,262
THAT'S SO GREAT.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

71
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,565
WELL, IT IS A LOT OF
WORK FOR ME,

72
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,434
BUT I FIGURE IF
I HELP YOU NOW,
YOU'RE GONNA OWE ME.

73
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,836
ABSOLUTELY.
ANYTHING, ANY TIME.

74
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,074
DONE.

75
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:38,318
IT'S TIME FOR THE
POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

76
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:43,022
[cheers and applause]

77
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,291
TODAY'S CONTESTANT WILL
BE PLAYING FOR

78
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:48,628
THE POSSUM LODGE
WORD GAME HOME VERSION!

79
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,530
OKAY, RED, YOU HAVE 30
SECONDS TO GET MIKE HAMAR --

80
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,031
COVER YOUR EARS --

81
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:53,700
TO SAY THIS WORD...

82
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,868
RESPECT

83
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,904
RESPECT

84
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,439
YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
WINSTON.

85
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:00,807
AND GO!

86
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,009
OKAY, MIKE,
WHEN YOUR WERE A KID,

87
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,478
YOU WERE TAUGHT TO ALWAYS
GIVE THIS TO YOUR PARENTS.

88
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,747
MY TAKE.

89
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,417
OKAY, IF YOU WANNA HAVE A
LASTING RELATIONSHIP
WITH A WOMAN,

90
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,419
YOU HAVE TO TREAT HER WITH...

91
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:16,923
ANTI-DEPRESSANTS.

92
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,693
OKAY, YOUR MOTHER PROBABLY
TOLD YOU THAT IF YOU WANNA
GET AHEAD IN LIFE,

93
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,129
YOU GOTTA SHOW A LITTLE...

94
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:24,797
THIGH.

95
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,836
RED, YOU'RE
ALMOST OUTTA TIME

96
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:33,206
I GOT IT!
THIS WAS BIG HIT FOR ARETHA
FRANKLIN IN THE '60s.

97
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,342
YOU CAN REMEMBER SOMETHING
FROM THE '60s?

98
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,244
BOY, YOU GOTTA
RESPECT THAT.

99
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,013
THERE WE GO!

100
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:43,516
[applause]

101
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:52,091
I GOT A LETTER FROM OUR
LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCY.

102
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,460
APPARENTLY ONE OF
OUR NEIGHBOURS HAS
REGISTERED A COMPLAINT

103
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:57,263
ABOUT ALL THE JUNK WE
HAVE LYING AROUND THE LODGE,

104
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,999
ESPECIALLY OUR
UNFINISHED PROJECTS.

105
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,468
I KNOW WHO IT IS TOO.

106
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,937
IT'S THAT NEW GUY
WITH THE FANCY A-FRAME.

107
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,640
HE'S BEEN GIVING US GRIEF
EVER SINCE HE SAW US
COOKING WIENIES

108
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,043
OVER A TIRE FIRE.

109
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:13,746
HE SAYS THE LODGE IS KEEPING
HIS PROPERTY VALUE DOWN.

110
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,348
WELL, SURE IT IS.

111
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,083
IT ALWAYS HAS.

112
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:21,020
IF IT DIDN'T,
HE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
ABLE TO AFFORD THE PLACE.

113
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,623
BUT NOW HE'S GONE AND GOT
THE GOVERNMENT INVOLVED,

114
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,858
AND I GOTTA GET
THE CAR OUTTA HERE.

115
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,461
ACTUALLY, THEY SAY IF I CAN
JUST REMOVE THE ENGINE
AND GAS TANK,

116
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,130
THEY'RE THE BIGGEST
ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS.

117
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,733
I GUESS THEY NEVER
SMELLED THE UPHOLSTERY.

118
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,905
NOW, AS ALWAYS, I LIKE
TO DO TWO THINGS AT ONCE,

119
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,040
BECAUSE THAT MEANS
I CAN WORK SLOWER.

120
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:43,409
SO I HAVE AN IDEA THAT'LL
SATISFY THE GOVERNMENT

121
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,979
AND INCREASE THE PROPERTY
VALUE ALL AT THE SAME TIME.

122
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,881
CAN YOU GUESS WHAT IT IS?

123
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:51,184
I'M GONNA TAKE OUT THE
ENGINE AND THE GAS TANK,

124
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,152
AND WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE
I'M GONNA DO WITH 'EM?

125
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:56,255
EXACTLY RIGHT: AN AUTOMATIC
LAWN SPRINKLER SYSTEM.

126
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,491
YOU'RE GOOD.

127
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,893
OKAY, NOW, TO TAKE OUT THE
ENGINE AND THE GAS TANK,

128
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,364
ALL YOU DO IS TAKE OUT THE
ENGINE AND THE GAS TANK.

129
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:51,444
[laughter and applause]

130
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,980
OKAY, THE REST OF THE
JOB IS PRETTY EASY HERE.

131
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,048
I'VE GOT EVERYTHING I NEED
TO MAKE THE ENGINE GO

132
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,284
MOUNTED TO THE INSIDE
OF THE BOAT HERE.

133
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,386
NOW, I HAD TO MAKE A
FEW MINOR ALTERATIONS

134
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:03,322
TO THE WATER PUMP
TO TURN IT INTO A SPRINKLER.

135
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:06,025
FIRST OF ALL, I QUADRUPLED
THE SIZE OF THE INTAKE HOSE.

136
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:08,761
SO THIS BABY'LL PASS
SOME SERIOUS WATER.

137
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,830
NOW I JUST DROP
THAT INTO THE LAKE.

138
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,832
OKAY, NOW, TO GET
THE BIG SPRAY,

139
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,967
I TOOK THE NOZZLE
OFF THE LODGE FIRE HOSE

140
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,837
AND ATTACHED THAT TO THE
OUTPUT SIDE OF THE WATER PUMP.

141
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,006
I'M NOT REALLY WORRIED ABOUT
THE LODGE CATCHING FIRE.

142
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,442
WE KEEP IT PRETTY DAMP.

143
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,877
AND HERE'S A LITTLE
EXTRA PIECE OF INGENUITY...

144
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,481
I ATTACHED THE ROPE JUST
TO THE ONE SIDE OF THE BOAT.

145
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,684
THAT WAY SHE'LL KIND
OF SWING AND SWAY

146
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,553
WITH THE WIND AND THE WAVES,

147
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,589
AND I'LL END UP GETTING
MAXIMUM COVERAGE WITH
MY WATER SPRAY.

148
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,258
OH, YEAH.
AND FOR SAFETY SAKE,

149
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:42,361
I ADDED A REMOTE STARTER.

150
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:47,333
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

151
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,502
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

152
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:23,169
I WANNA TALK TO ALL YOU GUYS
ABOUT SUCCEEDING AND FAILING.

153
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,605
NOW, WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP
AND GOING TO SCHOOL,

154
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,707
THEY PUT A LOT OF
EMPHASIS ON SUCCESS.

155
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,208
I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT.

156
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:32,645
I DON'T THINK SUCCESS IS
NEARLY AS IMPORTANT
AS FAILURE.

157
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,814
I'M NOT TALKIN' ABOUT
TOTAL FAILURE,

158
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:38,384
WHERE YOU LOSE EVERYTHING AND
LIVE IN A CARDBOARD BOX
UNDER A BRIDGE.

159
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:41,153
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT
MANAGEABLE FAILURE,

160
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,656
YOU KNOW, LIKE BEING
TEMPORARILY UNEMPLOYED

161
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,159
OR LOSING YOUR CAR KEYS
OR BUYING SOMETHING ON
TELEVISION THAT'S

162
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:50,096
"NOT AVAILABLE IN STORES."

163
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,964
NOW, DON'T GET ME WRONG.

164
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:55,468
SUCCESS IS GOOD, BUT IT
DOESN'T HAPPEN TO MOST OF US.

165
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,938
AND IF IT DID,
THEY'D CHANGE IT, BELIEVE ME.

166
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,574
SO I FIGURE, RATHER THAN
SPENDING YOUR WHOLE LIFE

167
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:04,110
FEELING BAD BECAUSE
YOU'VE NEVER SUCCEEDED,

168
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,779
I THINK FOR US NORMAL PEOPLE,

169
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:09,282
IT'S BETTER TO SPEND YOUR
WHOLE LIFE FEELING CONFIDENT

170
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,017
THAT YOU CAN HANDLE FAILURE.

171
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,351
SO HERE'S WHAT YOU DO...

172
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:15,221
TAKE SOME LITTLE HARMLESS
CHALLENGE AND JUST FAIL AT IT.

173
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,490
JUST FLUNK RIGHT
OUT AT IT.

174
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,026
THEN GET OVER IT
AND GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE.

175
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:22,929
AND JUST KEEP DOING THAT OVER
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

176
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,431
WHAT'LL HAPPEN IS YOU'LL STOP
BEING AFRAID OF FAILING.

177
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:28,434
YOU MIGHT EVEN
FLUKE A SUCCESS.

178
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,570
AT THE VERY LEAST,
YOU'LL BE A HAPPY FAILURE,

179
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,673
AND YOUR FRIENDS'LL HAVE A LOT
OF LAUGHS AT YOUR EXPENSE.

180
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,308
REMEMBER, I'M PULLIN'
FOR YOU.

181
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,509
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

182
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:40,212
[applause]

183
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,882
WELCOME TO THE EXPERTS'
PORTION OF THE SHOW,

184
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,284
WHERE WE EXPLORE THOSE
THREE LITTLE WORDS

185
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,886
MEN FIND SO HARD TO SAY...

186
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,221
audience: I DON'T KNOW!

187
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:50,990
YES, THOSE ARE
THE WORDS.

188
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,059
TODAY'S LETTER
READS AS FOLLOWS...

189
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,594
"DEAR EXPERTS,

190
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:57,563
"A GUY AT WORK HAS OWED ME
$100 FOR OVER A YEAR.

191
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,366
"YESTERDAY I FOUND HIS
WALLET IN THE LOCKER ROOM.

192
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:05,771
"THE WALLET HAD APPROXIMATELY
$187.13 IN IT.

193
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:09,375
"SHOULD I KEEP SOME
OF IT, ALL OF IT

194
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,876
"OR NONE OF IT?"

195
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,545
RED?

196
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,749
WELL, I HAVE AN ANSWER,
BUT I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO
HEAR WHAT MIKE HAS TO SAY.

197
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,618
OH, OKAY, SURE.

198
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:22,221
WELL, UH, I WOULD RETURN THE
WALLET TO ITS PROPER OWNER

199
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,024
COMPLETE WITH ALL
THE PERSON'S MONEY.

200
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:26,759
AND THAT'S
YOUR ANSWER?

201
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,261
THAT'S MY ANSWER
FOR TELEVISION.

202
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,764
YEAH, I AGREE.
I'D RETURN THE WALLET,

203
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:35,001
BUT I'D TAKE OUT THE
100 BUCKS THE GUY OWED ME.

204
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,103
OKAY, I KINDA AGREE
WITH BOTH OF YOU HERE.

205
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,871
I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T
KEEP THE WALLET.

206
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,473
I WOULD CHUCK IT
INTO A DUMPSTER

207
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,842
AFTER I HOISTED THE
180 BUCKS OUTTA HER.

208
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:45,311
THAT IS VERY
DISAPPOINTING.

209
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:48,047
YOU NOTICE A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN OUR ANSWER
AND YOURS?

210
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,950
YEAH, I DIDN'T LIE.

211
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,986
RED, YOU CAN'T
STEAL A MAN'S WALLET.

212
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,655
WELL, HE DIDN'T
STEAL THE WALLET.

213
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,356
THE GUY JUST LEFT IT
LYING AROUND.

214
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:58,991
I MEAN, IT WAS FAIR GAME.

215
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,826
YOU KNOW, I THINK
MR. GREEN MIGHT
BE RIGHT.

216
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,595
NO, HE'S NOT RIGHT.

217
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:04,230
WELL, SURE I AM.

218
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,799
BUT I'LL TELL YOU
THE PROBLEM, BAGGY PANTS...

219
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,435
BAGGY PANTS.
I LIKE TO WEAR MINE
A LITTLE BIT TIGHT.

220
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:13,472
THAT WAY I CAN ALWAYS FEEL MY
WALLET RIGHT WHERE --

221
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:17,176
YOU LOOKIN'
FOR THIS?

222
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,078
HOW'D YOU GET
MY WALLET?

223
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,847
MAYBE YOU JUST
LEFT IT LYING AROUND.

224
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,683
GIVE ME THE
WALLET BACK.

225
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,652
OKAY, BUT FIRST
I'LL TAKE OUT THE
20 BUCKS YOU OWE ME.

226
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:30,423
I DON'T OWE YOU 20 BUCKS;
YOU OWE ME 20 BUCKS.

227
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,425
OKAY, HERE YOU GO.

228
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,727
NOW WE'RE EVEN.

229
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,430
WE'RE NOT EVEN, MIKE.
THIS IS MY MONEY.

230
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,465
OKAY, OKAY, FINE.

231
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,435
UH, HERE'S THE
20 BUCKS I OWE YOU.

232
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,469
GREAT, THANK YOU

233
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,504
HEY, THAT'S
MY WALLET!

234
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,276
UH, MR. GREEN, YOU OWE
WINSTON 20 BUCKS.

235
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,086
[train whistling]

236
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,554
Red: HAVE YOU SEEN
THESE TOY TRAINS,

237
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,523
WHEN THEY RUN INTO SOMETHING,
THEY JUST TURN AROUND

238
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,358
AND HEAD OFF IN
ANOTHER DIRECTION,

239
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:09,462
KIND OF LIKE A POLITICIAN
AT A PRESS CONFERENCE?

240
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,466
I BET IF I LET THIS THING GO,
IT'D COVER THE WHOLE FLOOR.

241
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,668
IN FACT, I'M COUNTIN' ON IT.

242
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,370
NOW, YOU'RE PROBABLY
WONDERING WHY I WOULD
HAVE A TOY LIKE THIS.

243
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,072
I DON'T HAVE ANY KIDS.

244
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,409
I DON'T REALLY ENJOY A TOY
RUNNING UNDERFOOT MAKING
ANNOYING NOISES.

245
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,145
YOU PROBABLY COULDN'T GUESS
WHY I HAVE THIS TOY,

246
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,447
IF I GAVE YOU
A MONTH OF SUNDAYS.

247
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,484
BUT THEN AGAIN, YOU DON'T KNOW
THAT I PROMISED BERNICE

248
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,686
THAT I'D VACUUM THIS ROOM.

249
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:41,594
[vacuum humming,
toy train whistling]

250
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:48,134
[applause]

251
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:52,171
WELL, HAROLD'S STILL TRYING
TO CONVINCE EVERYBODY

252
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,774
TO CELEBRATE
CHRISTMAS IN JULY.

253
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:57,743
HE'S ALL DRESSED UP
LIKE A CHRISTMAS ANGEL.

254
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,745
HE'S GOT THIS
BOOTH DOWNTOWN,

255
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,982
WHERE HE'S SELLING CHRISTMAS
COOKIES AND PUMPKIN PIES.

256
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:05,818
AND HE'S SINGING
CHRISTMAS CAROLS.

257
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,586
WHAT IS IT WITH
SINGING VOICES?

258
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,156
YOU EVER NOTICE HOW THE
BAD ONES ARE ALWAYS LOUD?

259
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:13,425
NOBODY WANTS TO HARK WHEN THEY
HEAR THIS "HAROLD" ANGEL SING.

260
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:20,266
[laughter and applause]

261
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,836
MAN, HAROLD.

262
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:26,438
YOU OKAY?
YOU LOOK A
LITTLE PIE-EYED.

263
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,109
MAY I HAVE A
TOWEL, PLEASE?

264
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,779
HERE'S A CURTAIN.

265
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,182
WELL, THIS WAS
A LEARNING EXPERIENCE.

266
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,517
NEVER TO SING WHEN
THERE'S PIES AROUND?

267
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,419
NO, THAT THIS TOWN NEEDS A
LITTLE CHRISTMAS

268
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,121
RIGHT THIS VERY MINUTE!

269
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,390
THERE'S HARDLY ANY SPIRIT
OF HUMAN KINDNESS OUT
THERE AT ALL.

270
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,158
HAROLD,
GIVE IT UP, OKAY?

271
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,127
A PUMPKIN PIE IN THE
FACE IS NO HARM DONE.

272
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:51,564
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET OFF
SO LUCKY WHEN THE CORN
COBS COME OUT.

273
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,632
I DO NOT QUIT,
UNCLE RED!

274
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,534
I'VE ALREADY SPOKEN TO SOME
OF THE LODGE MEMBERS.

275
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,003
THEY'VE AGREED
TO JOIN ME IN A VERY
SPECIAL CHRISTMAS PARADE.

276
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,705
OH, NO.

277
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,778
HAROLD, THIS FROSTY THE
SNOWMAN COSTUME IS RIDICULOUS.

278
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:06,645
IT'S HOT.
IT'S ITCHY.

279
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,347
I'M MELTING IN HERE.

280
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,983
WELL, NOW, THERE'S
A JOLLY, HAPPY SOUL.

281
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,719
HOW DO YOU LIKE
MY RED NOSE, MR. GREEN?

282
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:16,822
YOU WEARING
A RED NOSE?

283
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,891
I THINK YOU GUYS
LOOK GREAT.

284
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,526
I NEED YOUR HELP
TOO, UNCLE RED.

285
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,161
YEAH, I NEED YOU
TO DRIVE THE FLOAT.

286
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,263
SURE.
WHAT IS IT, ANYWAY?

287
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,365
IT'S SOFT DRINK
DELIVERY TRUCK.

288
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,000
WHAT KIND OF
SOFT DRINK?

289
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:28,901
ROOT BEER.

290
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,003
OH, SO IT'S A
ROOT BEER FLOAT.

291
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,111
AM I SUPPOSED TO
LAUGH AT THAT?

292
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,146
WELL, IT'S
CHRISTMAS, HAROLD.

293
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,848
IT'S PARADE TIME,
UNCLE RED.

294
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,850
HEY, WHAT COSTUME ARE
YOU WEARING, MR. GREEN?

295
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,819
I'M GOING LIKE THIS.
I'M GOING AS THE SMART ONE.

296
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,921
I CAN PULL THAT OFF.

297
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,923
SHOULD WORK
IF HE DOESN'T TALK.

298
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,161
Red: I WANTED TO REPLACE THE
TIRE SWING OUT THE BACK,

299
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,097
BUT WALTER SEEMED TO THINK
THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH IT.

300
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,299
HE'S THE ONE WHO USES IT,
SO I DIDN'T WANNA ARGUE.

301
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:04,270
SEE, I THINK IT NEEDS --
YEAH.

302
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:07,439
I THINK IT NEEDS
TO BE REPLACED.

303
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,276
OF COURSE, WHAT WE NEED TO
DO THAT IS ANOTHER TIRE.

304
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,278
WE USUALLY HAVE TIRES
AROUND THE LODGE.

305
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:15,080
WE KINDA -- WE KEEP LOTS OF
STUFF AROUND THE LODGE.

306
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:19,051
SO WE LET WALTER PICK 'CAUSE
HE'S THE ONE WHO USES
THE TIRE SWING.

307
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,320
HE'S GOT ONE RIGHT THERE.

308
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:24,924
GIVE HER A BOUNCE, WALTER,
TO MAKE SURE SHE'S OKAY.

309
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,460
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

310
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,896
SO MOVING ON.
ACTUALLY WE HAVE
A LOT OF JUNK.

311
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:34,133
FUNNY HOW THINGS JUST PILE UP
IF YOU DON'T GET THINGS
PUT AWAY PROPERLY.

312
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,335
I DON'T EXACTLY WHAT
WE HAD IN MIND

313
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,237
WHEN WE CREATED
THIS LITTLE DISPLAY.

314
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,472
PROBABLY NOTHING.

315
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,675
WE KEEP MOVING ON.

316
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:45,344
YOU KNOW, THERE'S TIRES
BEHIND ONE OF THE
OUT BUILDINGS.

317
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:47,746
YEAH, THAT'S IT.
LOOK AT ALL THE TIRES.

318
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,282
WE LIKE ANY OF THESE
DOWN ON THE GROUND.

319
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:53,452
OF COURSE, WALTER SEES ONE
UP ON THE ROOF THAT HE WANTS.

320
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,989
SO THE BIG QUESTION IS:
HOW DOES A TIRE GET
UP ON THE ROOF?

321
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,691
WALTER HAS NO IDEA.

322
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:01,160
HE WANTS US TO PILE
THE TIRES UP ON TOP THERE,

323
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:04,330
AND HE'LL JUST CLIMB UP
AND GET DOWN

324
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,699
WHAT HE SEES
AS HIS FAVOURITE TIRE.

325
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:10,336
WALTER IS KIND OF ATHLETIC,
AND UP HE GOES.

326
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,271
IT LOOKS A LITTLE
SHAKY TO ME,

327
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,906
BUT HE'S FINE WITH IT.

328
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:16,508
SO HE GETS UP THERE,
AND HE'S JUST GONNA
GRAB THE TIRE.

329
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:20,946
KEEP HER BALANCED.
NICE -- YOU'RE GOOD.

330
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,816
YOU'RE GOOD.
YOU'RE GOOD.

331
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,218
OKAY, COME ON DOWN.
COME ON DOWN.

332
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,920
OH!

333
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:32,424
SO NOW WE GOTTA
GET HIM OUTTA THERE.

334
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,727
NOW, THE FIRST FEW
COME OFF NO PROBLEM.

335
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:38,831
BUT NOW WE'RE GETTIN'
DOWN INTO THE RADIALS

336
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,266
WITH THE SMALL RIM,
AND IT JUST WON'T FIT
AROUND HIS WAIST.

337
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,370
SO RATHER THAN TAKE THE TIRE
OFF, I FIGURE WHY DON'T WE
JUST USE THAT TIRE,

338
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:48,007
GET WALTER OVER TO THE SWING
AND JUST ATTACH THE ROPE

339
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,376
RIGHT DIRECTLY TO THE TIRE
THAT WALTER IS WEARING?

340
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,077
IT'S A LITTLE BIT EASIER.

341
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,113
SO WE GET THAT
HOOKED ON THERE,

342
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,914
SO WE GIVE HIM
A NICE LITTLE --

343
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,616
IT'S NOT EXCITING ENOUGH,
HE'S COMPLAINING.

344
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,385
HE WANTS A REAL GOOD --
SO I GET AN IDEA.

345
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,120
GET HIM TO LIE DOWN.
LIE DOWN, WALTER.

346
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,455
NOW, WINSTON, LET'S GIVE
HIM A REAL GOOD --

347
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,657
AND I THINK, OF COURSE,
WE PUSHED A LITTLE TOO HARD.

348
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,826
THE ROPE BROKE OFF THERE.

349
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:10,062
AND THEN DOWN SHE COMES,
AND THEN UP THE SLIDE,

350
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:13,032
AND THEN INTO THE TUB.

351
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,666
BUT HE'S ALL RIGHT.
HE'S FINE.

352
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,169
HE'S ALL GOOD.

353
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,206
OKAY, THAT'S HOW THE
TIRE ENDED UP ON THE
ROOF, I GUESS.

354
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:27,579
[applause]

355
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,286
NOW, HERE'S AN IDEA THAT'S
EITHER GONNA CHANGE WHAT
YOU THINK OF ME,

356
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,322
OR CONFIRM WHAT
YOU ALREADY SUSPECTED.

357
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,925
YOU KNOW WHEN THE ROADS ARE
COVERED WITH SNOW AND ICE?

358
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:43,262
INSTEAD OF GOING OUT AND
BUYING SNOW TIRES LIKE
YOU'RE MADE OF MONEY,

359
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,931
OR STAYING HOME,
LIKE YOU'RE FUN TO BE WITH,

360
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:47,599
WHY DON'T YOU TRY THIS?

361
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,102
HOOK UP A COUPLE
OF OLD SHOWER HEADS

362
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,972
IN FRONT OF EACH
OF YOUR WHEELS, POINTING
STRAIGHT DOWN AT THE ROAD.

363
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:58,343
THEN YOU CONNECT THEM ALL
TOGETHER WITH THIS
FLEXIBLE HOSE,

364
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,180
WHICH YOU CAN GET FROM
ANY CONSTRUCTION SITE
DURING A STRIKE.

365
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,349
AND YOU RUN THE HOSES ALL
THE WAY DOWN TO THE BACK,

366
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:08,087
AND HOOK THEM UP TO THE
EXHAUST PIPE OF YOUR VEHICLE.

367
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,222
AND IT'S JUST THAT EASY.

368
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,624
YOU DON'T NEED SNOW TIRES,
BECAUSE THE HEAT FROM
THE EXHAUST

369
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:15,961
WILL MELT THE SNOW LONG BEFORE
YOUR TIRES EVER GET THERE.

370
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:17,863
GIVE IT A TRY.

371
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,066
YOU'LL HAVE PEOPLE IN YOUR
TOWN WONDERING WHERE YOU
GOT THE HOT WHEELS,

372
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,635
RATHER THAN WHERE
YOU GOT THE HOT CAR.

373
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:37,616
[applause]

374
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,920
THAT WAS THE MOST DISGUSTING,

375
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:45,090
EMBARRASSING THING THAT'S
EVER HAPPENED TO ME
IN MY LIFE.

376
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,826
AND BELIEVE ME,
I'VE HAD SOME DANDIES.

377
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,695
IT WAS TERRIBLE.

378
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:51,964
OH, MAN!
THANKS, HAROLD.

379
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:54,299
THAT WAS A HOOT.

380
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,669
THAT HAD TO BE THE
MOST FUN PARADE EVER.

381
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,304
THAT WASN'T FUN.

382
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,540
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE GONNA GET KILLED.

383
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,409
RED GOT HER GOING
PRETTY QUICK, HUH?

384
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,145
WE'RE GOING TO
THE MEETING.

385
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,846
ARE YOU COMING?

386
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,749
NO, I'M GONNA WAIT RIGHT
HERE FOR THE GRINCH.

387
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,518
WHERE IS HE
ANYWAY?

388
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,420
HE'S PARKING THE POP TRUCK
AND APOLOGIZING TO
THE POLICE.

389
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,959
HO HO HO.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

390
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,761
WHAT WAS THAT
ALL ABOUT?

391
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:25,564
THE ENTIRE CHRISTMAS
PARADE ONLY TOOK
45 SECONDS.

392
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,266
HOW FAST WERE
YOU GOING?

393
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,034
I DON'T KNOW.

394
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,969
MY STOMACH WAS
BLOCKING THE DASHBOARD.

395
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,072
WE WERE HOT, AND THAT
BREEZE WAS VERY REFRESHING.

396
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:37,276
A CHRISTMAS PARADE IS NOT
SUPPOSED TO PEEL RUBBER.

397
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,745
CHRISTMAS SYMBOLIZES
PEACE ON EARTH,

398
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,381
NOT HELL ON WHEELS.

399
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:45,384
SO YOU'RE NOT
HAPPY WITH SANTA?

400
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,888
NOT WHEN SANTA
TURNS A PARADE INTO
A DEMOLITION DERBY.

401
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,157
NO ONE WAS
EVER AT RISK.

402
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,127
I DON'T THINK EITHER OF THE
SPECTATORS WERE INJURED.

403
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,963
OKAY. OKAY.
OKAY.

404
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,133
YOU ARE THE WORST SANTA
THERE HAS EVER BEEN.

405
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,303
OH, I THINK
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN
I'M MAKIN' A LIST

406
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,071
AND CHECKIN'
IT TWICE.

407
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:09,007
AND THAT WAS A LITTLE
NAUGHTY AND NOT
VERY NICE.

408
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,909
DID YOU GET WHAT YOU
WANTED FOR CHRISTMAS?

409
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,711
NO WONDER.
NO.

410
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,913
'CAUSE YOU CRIED
AND YOU POUTED.

411
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,949
BUT LET ME LOOK
IN MY SACK, LITTLE BOY.

412
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,617
I THINK I MAY HAVE
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

413
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,818
I GOT SOMETHING.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

414
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:21,253
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
I'VE GOT SOMETHING.

415
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:24,990
WHAT DO YOU GOT?
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

416
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:26,959
HOW'S THAT, EH?
WHAT?

417
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,727
OH! OH!
WHAT IS THAT?

418
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,395
WELL, THAT'S A
CAN OF ROOT BEER.

419
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,231
BUT YOU KNOW, IT ROLLED
AROUND A BIT IN THE TRUCK,

420
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:35,934
SO I WOULD SAY DON'T OPEN
THAT UNTIL CHRISTMAS.

421
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,670
[possum squealing]

422
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,838
IT'S MEETING TIME.

423
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,709
NO, YOU'RE GOOD.
YOU'RE GOOD.

424
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,144
WATCH THE DOOR.
ALL RIGHT, GOOD.

425
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:49,281
OKAY. SO IF MRS. CLAUS IS WATCHING,

426
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,149
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT
HOME AFTER THE MEETING.

427
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:54,186
AND I'M REALLY HOPING THERE'S
SOMETHING FOR ME UNDER
THE TREE TONIGHT.

428
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:57,522
OR EVEN BETTER, I'M HOPING
I CAN ACTUALLY COME INTO
THE HOUSE.

429
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,458
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

430
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:02,527
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND THE
WHOLE GANG UP HERE AT
POSSUM LODGE,

431
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,396
MERRY CHRISTMAS, AND KEEP
YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

432
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:11,270
[applause]

433
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,739
OKAY, GUYS,
COME AND SIT DOWN.

434
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,207
EVERYBODY SIT DOWN.

435
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,109
COME ON, GUYS.
EVERYBODY SIT DOWN.

436
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,443
SIT DOWN.

437
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,213
ALL RISE.

438
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:26,251
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI.

439
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,887
Red: SIT DOWN.

440
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,390
ALL RIGHT, MEN, BOW YOUR HEADS
FOR THE MAN'S PRAYER.

441
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:34,426
I'M A MAN, BUT I CAN CHANGE,

442
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:38,330
IF I HAVE TO, I GUESS.

443
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:40,766
OKAY, GUYS, THIS CHRISTMAS
IN JULY THING

444
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,434
WAS NOT A BIG SUCCESS.

445
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:43,368
WE'RE CANCELING
THE WHOLE DEAL,

446
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,671
WHICH I THINK IS GOOD,
BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE LET TO

447
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,339
NEW YEAR'S ON FIRECRACKER DAY,

448
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,007
AND THAT WOULD COST LIVES.
