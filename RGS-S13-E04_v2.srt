1
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:15,949
As you get older, you know, you start to
realize that your true wealth is time, partly

2
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:20,420
because you don't have much of it left,
partly because of true wealth was money, you

3
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:25,191
blew it. So anything that can save you time
becomes more and more valuable.

4
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:29,129
Now, for me, driving into the garage is a
real waste of time because you got to do it

5
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:32,999
so slowly. Otherwise, you go right out the
back end again.

6
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,570
Oh, sure, I guess you could get the brakes
fixed on your car, but who has that kind of

7
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:43,610
money? So instead, I've been collecting
boxes and boxes of these Styrofoam chips that

8
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:47,280
they used for packing, like when you buy a
Chia pet on the internet.

9
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:52,919
And I'm going to put them into this plastic
resealable bag that our new mattress came in.

10
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:56,923
Furnace went with the king size, so she get
a little further away from the action.

11
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,892
Or she calls it snoring.

12
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,830
And I figure if I filled this bag full of
these Styrofoam chips and then seal her up

13
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,100
tight, I'll be able to go into the garage at
any speed that I want.

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,802
I want to take off the hood ornament first.

15
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:02,188
It. Our big,

16
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:06,659
Big week up at the launch this week, the town
of Possum Lake is decided to get rid of the

17
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,628
old wishing well down town.

18
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:14,100
I know the odd time might go by there and
throw in a handful of coins and then make a

19
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,436
wish that I wish I hadn't done that.

20
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:21,774
Couple read, Yeah, well, Fred, what can you
tell the guys to hold it down?

21
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:22,975
I have a terrible headache.

22
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:25,278
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry to hear that, Harold.

23
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:26,846
Well, maybe if we could just turn off his
truck?

24
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,484
No, I can't do that. The battery's dead, and
I don't think we want to be pushed.

25
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,319
Start a sewage truck here on.

26
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:36,622
You're trying these. Well, thank you.

27
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:41,427
Ok. Those aspirin are huge.

28
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:43,496
Oh, they weren't aspirin, they were
earplugs.

29
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:57,710
What's that? Oh, there's some coins we took
out of the wishing, well, we're doing kind of

30
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,345
a late night withdrawal last night.

31
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,782
Oh, sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

32
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:06,319
A lot that's just a spillover.

33
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,255
We suck most of it up with Winston Strut.

34
00:03:09,488 --> 00:03:11,290
All right, Winston, let her go.

35
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,497
Money is going to need to be laundered.

36
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:32,111
It's time for the Possum Lodge word game.

37
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,152
Today's winner will

38
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:43,823
Receive this coupon for one free session from
Mario's male

39
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:45,524
Hair removal center,

40
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,695
Where we specialize in speedo waxes.

41
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:53,232
For the little European in all of us.

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,905
Ok, Gordon, cover your ears, read you got 30
seconds to get Dalton to say this word.

43
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:03,075
Scale scare.

44
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:08,247
All right and go, OK, Dalton, this is
something you have in the house that tells

45
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:09,348
you when you're gaining weight.

46
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:10,783
Oh, my wife.

47
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:18,190
Ok. What's this called Do-Re-Mi for solar,
tido French.

48
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,093
No. Ok.

49
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:25,164
Ok. This is what you find on a fish eye
tartar sauce.

50
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,804
Ok. Ok. If you have a model that's a lot
smaller than the real thing, it's called a

51
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,173
something model anorexic model.

52
00:04:35,941 --> 00:04:37,977
Ok, OK, OK, OK, Don.

53
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:44,116
Now, if you're going to climb Mount Everest,
people would say you were going to do what?

54
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:45,451
On the mountain die.

55
00:04:49,588 --> 00:04:50,823
Read almost out of time here.

56
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:54,994
Ok, well, I know Dalton, there's there's a
statue, it's supposed to represent justice

57
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,762
and it's a woman holding something.

58
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:57,897
You probably have one of these in your
store.

59
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,599
No, that sounds way too upscale for my
customer.

60
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:25,290
Rothschild, sewage and septic sucking
services, we love to see you smile.

61
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:30,596
When I go camping with the guys, I don't take
my Swiss Army knife anymore.

62
00:05:31,096 --> 00:05:35,501
Oh sure, it's a good looking unit and it's
nice to have handy in case the Swiss invade.

63
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:41,040
But for me, the joy of having 12 tools and
one is dampened by having to eat my dinner

64
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,610
with the same utensil Buster Hatfield just
used to clip his toenails.

65
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:51,417
Now, personally, I think it's time for the
Swiss Army knife to evolve into something a

66
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:55,087
little more practical like, say, a Swiss
Army surfboard.

67
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:58,557
Oh, sure, it sounds like the title of an old
Elvis movie.

68
00:05:59,191 --> 00:06:05,564
I think it finds a lot more entertaining now
for this to work.

69
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:08,534
What you need are a couple of good sized
wind surfboards.

70
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:10,435
Shouldn't be too hard to come by.

71
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:14,206
Just look for a couple of guys coming out of
a midlife crisis, and I think you'll be able

72
00:06:14,206 --> 00:06:15,407
to pick them up for a song.

73
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:17,576
Maybe something by the Beach Boys.

74
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,446
Why don't you get them lined up one on top
of the other?

75
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,015
You want to seal the one side?

76
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:26,552
Top to bottom with the handy man secret
weapon duct tape.

77
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:38,230
And there you go. Now all you have to do is
secure the open side for easy transportation.

78
00:06:38,463 --> 00:06:42,200
You might want to do that with some type of
a rust proof graphite metal clasp.

79
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:43,969
I would do it with another piece of duct
tape.

80
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,840
Now I don't want you thinking, Oh, sure,
it's a good looking unit red, but how do I

81
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,742
get all my camping gear in the car?

82
00:06:51,143 --> 00:06:52,411
Well, that's the beauty of it.

83
00:06:52,544 --> 00:06:53,946
This is your camping gear.

84
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:58,417
This is all you need. Got a couple of
changes of underwear here?

85
00:06:58,717 --> 00:07:00,052
I'll see about that kind of thing.

86
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,757
There's your knife and your forks and your
spoon and a big enough slab of beef jerky

87
00:07:05,757 --> 00:07:07,292
that you'll never need any of them.

88
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:15,567
There's more so much more a bedroll, you're
a fishing rod.

89
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:19,905
And the comfort here, but still.

90
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:25,444
An old van, I commend you one of these, if
you need it.

91
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:29,781
I got my share of old fans for your nightly
entertainment.

92
00:07:31,049 --> 00:07:37,889
Oh, here we go. A 22 inch television.

93
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,259
Oh, I know what you're thinking. That's
impossible.

94
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:45,831
And it is without this portable generator.

95
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:51,536
Remember, if the women don't find you
handsome, they say, Oh, I almost forgot.

96
00:07:52,037 --> 00:07:53,738
They also want to throw a paddle in there.

97
00:07:54,673 --> 00:08:04,483
Let me show you why. It's not just a Swiss
Army surfboard, it's also a

98
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:05,684
Swiss Navy surfboard.

99
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,770
Sometimes when couples get older and the
kids leave home, they'll move into a smaller

100
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:31,076
house. Usually it's the wife's decision, you
know, one day she'll turn to her husband and

101
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:34,512
she'll say, We really don't need all this
space anymore.

102
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:38,250
And the next thing you know, there's a sign
on the front lawn and a guy in a mint green

103
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,018
jacket is walking strangers through their
kitchen.

104
00:08:42,254 --> 00:08:44,222
Most men fight the downsizing.

105
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:49,561
That's because the phrase we have too much
space is outside of their vocabulary.

106
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:53,098
Men don't have too much space.

107
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:56,735
Men don't have enough space ever.

108
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:02,440
We've spent a lifetime hunting and gathering
a basement full of bounty.

109
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:09,481
We're darn proud of it. That's why your
husband needs to keep the fun for futon from

110
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:16,888
college and the Boxcar Willie eight tracks
and that world's greatest lover T-shirt he

111
00:09:16,888 --> 00:09:21,960
got 20 years ago, which was a rough guess
then and is right off the radar at this.

112
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:28,800
See, the smart wife knows that moving into a
smaller house is the only way to get her

113
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,305
husband to ditch all that crap because given
the choice between move it or lose it, a guy

114
00:09:34,305 --> 00:09:36,808
my age will always choose to lose it.

115
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:43,081
We're just too lazy to pack it up and take
it somewhere so that somebody come over and

116
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:44,449
haul her all the way to the dump.

117
00:09:44,883 --> 00:09:47,185
That's where most of it came from in the
first place.

118
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:49,287
Remember, I'm pulling for you.

119
00:09:49,788 --> 00:09:50,889
We're all in this together.

120
00:09:55,727 --> 00:09:57,729
That town's sewage and septic sucking

121
00:09:57,729 --> 00:10:00,365
Services where everywhere you don't want to
be.

122
00:10:09,474 --> 00:10:14,579
Hello, sat back and I wish you well,
project, the bank won't accept the coins

123
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:19,884
unless we sort them first by, the banks
always have to be so difficult.

124
00:10:20,785 --> 00:10:22,921
I wish I had a nickel for every time I've
said that.

125
00:10:24,989 --> 00:10:27,959
You do. Headaches gone.

126
00:10:27,992 --> 00:10:29,861
Headaches gone. Headaches gone.

127
00:10:29,861 --> 00:10:31,029
Headaches gone wrong.

128
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:32,530
I think mine just got here.

129
00:10:34,065 --> 00:10:35,300
That's too bad. Mine's gone.

130
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,603
One. Well, I'm all better, what can I do?

131
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:41,906
What can I do? We're sorting, Harold, what
denomination do you like?

132
00:10:41,906 --> 00:10:42,473
Lutheran?

133
00:10:44,742 --> 00:10:46,110
Do the pennies herald, OK?

134
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:48,079
You know, I'm doing pennies.

135
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:49,213
No, I know why.

136
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:50,348
No, I know why.

137
00:10:51,082 --> 00:10:52,283
Because I got the most sense.

138
00:10:58,022 --> 00:10:59,090
Well, still early,

139
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:02,060
Where's the coin tubes?

140
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,696
You've got to roll the coins, the banks
won't take them in these banks.

141
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:06,798
Why not? That's the way they give it out.

142
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,869
Yeah, the Mike, don't forget you have that
Smith and Wesson ATM card.

143
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:16,040
Carol, are you saying we have to roll the
coins as well as stardom?

144
00:11:16,074 --> 00:11:17,542
Oh yeah. Wait a minute.

145
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:20,545
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Who has more
money than a bank?

146
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:24,982
Celine Dion? The point is casino.

147
00:11:25,216 --> 00:11:27,585
That's right. They'll sort it for us.

148
00:11:27,852 --> 00:11:28,419
Let's go.

149
00:11:29,587 --> 00:11:31,222
Great idea, Mr.

150
00:11:31,222 --> 00:11:31,489
Great.

151
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:33,057
I can help you get there.

152
00:11:33,057 --> 00:11:37,195
But I can't technically go into the casino
for another 30 days.

153
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:39,997
All right. Bring all the coins.

154
00:11:40,631 --> 00:11:42,200
Ok. There's one that fell on the floor here,
too.

155
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:43,868
I'll get that one. Yeah, I'm got to get them
all.

156
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:44,368
All right.

157
00:11:50,308 --> 00:11:51,943
Is that behind the line there, because I

158
00:11:51,943 --> 00:11:56,314
Heard the Bill and Walter were fooling around
and boy, something knocks off mirror right

159
00:11:56,314 --> 00:11:59,851
off the truck. It's a little kind of an odd
projectile on them.

160
00:11:59,884 --> 00:12:03,988
There goes another one. So I thought they
were having a fight.

161
00:12:03,988 --> 00:12:05,089
They seem to be punching each other in the
stomach.

162
00:12:05,423 --> 00:12:06,924
But oh okay.

163
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,826
Yeah, it's a little all in the water, right?

164
00:12:09,293 --> 00:12:10,828
Ok, no. I know water rockets.

165
00:12:10,828 --> 00:12:14,932
I know you help them up and then you fire
them off like that.

166
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,402
And then, yeah, that's that's exciting.

167
00:12:18,402 --> 00:12:21,572
Way to go. And then Bill being a little
older.

168
00:12:28,145 --> 00:12:30,281
So now I'm enjoying that, and I can see the
final debate.

169
00:12:30,414 --> 00:12:32,283
Yeah, I mean, that's I can see that now.

170
00:12:32,316 --> 00:12:34,752
Yeah, yeah. So now they're going to take her
up a notch.

171
00:12:34,752 --> 00:12:36,220
Bill's got the idea instead of using it.

172
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,189
Why don't we use the cola bottles?

173
00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:41,125
You know, because a little bit bigger with
the carbonation, you're going to get a

174
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,761
little, but you've got to get some of the
liquid out of there.

175
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:46,063
And of course, these guys don't want to
waste anything.

176
00:12:46,063 --> 00:12:49,133
So instead of just pouring it out, they they
they fart in.

177
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:53,738
You know what I'm saying? I don't know if
you've ever tried this, but there's there can

178
00:12:53,738 --> 00:12:56,173
be some pain involved with that.

179
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,111
When I was afraid of getting caught in the
overspray, so Bill luckily had something in

180
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:01,178
his pants for a change and.

181
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:05,950
All that's got to hurt that that's that's
painful.

182
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,652
I would if I was you, I'd quit, but I'm not
you.

183
00:13:10,821 --> 00:13:15,526
Soldiers talking it down, and we we get a
sense that there's something coming our way.

184
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:20,631
All right. And that's fine. That was from
this very tastefully done bill, maybe not

185
00:13:20,631 --> 00:13:22,133
quite as tasteful as Walter.

186
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,334
No sense of decorum.

187
00:13:23,334 --> 00:13:24,702
And he figures he's outdoors.

188
00:13:25,703 --> 00:13:27,471
Easy now. Easy, easy, easy.

189
00:13:27,571 --> 00:13:28,072
Easy.

190
00:13:38,215 --> 00:13:40,117
Harry, I think I'm just going to step back a
little bit.

191
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:46,957
So they hook the they hook the coal, I put
the umbrella for my head at first and then

192
00:13:47,358 --> 00:13:50,294
they got him up the bicycle tire pumps and
they're pumping up and getting the pressure

193
00:13:50,294 --> 00:13:54,565
going. And I get a feeling these are
probably going to blow sideways rather than

194
00:13:54,565 --> 00:13:56,934
up. So I'm probably better to go the
horizontal.

195
00:13:58,402 --> 00:14:03,007
Umbrella thing, and you know, right about
now, I'm looking pretty smart because that's

196
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,607
exactly what.

197
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:06,911
Patches in your head.

198
00:14:07,111 --> 00:14:11,015
Oh, so now we take up another notch.

199
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:18,689
Got the water cooler with the dual throat
carb fuel injection air intake on her there

200
00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:21,458
and is starting to distort a little under
the pressure so.

201
00:14:23,193 --> 00:14:24,395
Second, you know, we wait.

202
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:28,098
Maybe that's enough pressure built and one
more elbow, maybe one more.

203
00:14:28,098 --> 00:14:29,533
And no, I think we're good bill.

204
00:14:29,566 --> 00:14:30,901
Bill, we're good Bill. We're good.

205
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:32,603
We're good, we're good. One more.

206
00:14:32,636 --> 00:14:34,805
And and oh boy, hang on.

207
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:36,106
While hang on, hang on.

208
00:14:36,573 --> 00:14:37,841
And of course, one more.

209
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:40,744
And that may have been too much for you.

210
00:14:46,183 --> 00:14:48,218
And I look at Bill, get soaked,

211
00:14:48,218 --> 00:14:50,120
I'm loving this, and I think Walter's

212
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,889
Coming your way, bill. Here he comes down.

213
00:14:54,258 --> 00:14:54,591
Oh.

214
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,804
Today, I'm talking animals, local animal
control officer Ed Frit is here to tell us

215
00:15:06,804 --> 00:15:07,938
all about spiders.

216
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:09,673
Yes, that's spiders.

217
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:15,579
No, no, no, no, the spiders read, who told
Jaws, Go talk about spiders.

218
00:15:16,313 --> 00:15:17,081
I thought you did.

219
00:15:17,381 --> 00:15:18,682
Well, yeah, you thought you thought.

220
00:15:18,682 --> 00:15:21,385
You thought you thought you thought that
weasel wouldn't bite.

221
00:15:21,418 --> 00:15:22,419
Yeah, yeah.

222
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:24,421
You thought that skunk had been descended.

223
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:26,824
Yeah, yeah. You paid the price there, huh?

224
00:15:27,391 --> 00:15:31,428
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think we're through
making decisions based on what you think.

225
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:34,698
All right. That's why tonight we're going to
meet Mr.

226
00:15:34,698 --> 00:15:36,099
Possum. Oh, yeah.

227
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:38,435
You know anything about possums red?

228
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:42,840
While this is possible, I'm the leader of
Possum Lodge, we have the possum on our

229
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,309
crest, and when I was in high school, my
nickname was possum.

230
00:15:45,576 --> 00:15:47,711
Well, I didn't know that you made it to high
school.

231
00:15:51,848 --> 00:15:55,185
Anyway, possums are very civilized animals.

232
00:15:55,185 --> 00:15:59,156
They don't bite you or sting you or hide in
your underwear drawer.

233
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,892
We get them when they're scared.

234
00:16:01,925 --> 00:16:03,160
What do you think they do?

235
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:04,695
Lay down? They play.

236
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:09,666
Yeah. Anyway, let's take a look at this
possum.

237
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:13,236
But first, I'm going to scare it so it'll
act dead.

238
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,839
All right. Oh.

239
00:16:19,109 --> 00:16:21,044
Kate, take a look.

240
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,018
I know something else about possums.

241
00:16:28,885 --> 00:16:29,653
They need air.

242
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,391
No, no, no, he's fine.

243
00:16:37,561 --> 00:16:38,662
He's just toying with us.

244
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:42,566
I think you're going to have to resuscitate a
man.

245
00:16:44,301 --> 00:16:45,736
Suggested CPR.

246
00:16:46,903 --> 00:16:49,539
Oh, I'm a mouth to mouth resuscitation.

247
00:16:50,374 --> 00:16:52,476
Hey, folks. Once he had performed a miracle
here.

248
00:16:57,514 --> 00:17:01,518
Yeah. And just small puffs now, don't
inflate them.

249
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,668
Should a nun spiders?

250
00:17:22,405 --> 00:17:23,740
They're seen one of these things.

251
00:17:24,074 --> 00:17:26,076
It's called a photovoltaic cell.

252
00:17:26,576 --> 00:17:30,647
Whenever light shines on it, it makes
electricity, so you can actually use this as

253
00:17:30,647 --> 00:17:32,382
a switch that's turned on by light.

254
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:36,653
Some of the finest restaurants use these so
that when your headlights shine on them, it

255
00:17:36,653 --> 00:17:40,724
rings a bell inside and then the waitress
comes out on roller skates, bringing you your

256
00:17:40,724 --> 00:17:44,694
jumbo triple cheeseburger and large order of
fries so that you can have the heart attack

257
00:17:44,694 --> 00:17:46,229
in the privacy of your own vehicle.

258
00:17:47,297 --> 00:17:50,967
Speaking of which, I've come up with a way
to use these little switches to make it a lot

259
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:52,168
easier to drive a car.

260
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:58,241
These days, we got way too many distractions
while you're behind the wheel and the old

261
00:17:58,241 --> 00:18:01,444
days. All it was is a fuzzy dice and the
eight track player to worry about.

262
00:18:01,778 --> 00:18:05,582
Now you've got triple odometer weather
detectors, CD players, air conditioning,

263
00:18:05,582 --> 00:18:09,552
power windows, airbag locks, GPS tracking
system and cup holders.

264
00:18:10,754 --> 00:18:13,923
That's a lot to ask from a mind that's got
more miles out than the car does.

265
00:18:15,358 --> 00:18:19,896
So what I did was I attached a photovoltaic
cell on each and every one of the new dads

266
00:18:19,896 --> 00:18:23,166
and gadgets on the automobile, which means
that the turn each went on.

267
00:18:23,466 --> 00:18:25,168
Also have to do is shine a light on it.

268
00:18:27,237 --> 00:18:28,571
That's what this spotlight is for.

269
00:18:28,571 --> 00:18:30,907
I just turn it on and then aiming at my own
head.

270
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:38,348
Next, they put on these mirrored sunglasses,
which will reflect the light to whatever I'm

271
00:18:38,348 --> 00:18:40,150
looking at, which we'll turn it on like
this.

272
00:18:49,025 --> 00:18:50,193
And it's just that easy.

273
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,130
Oh, sure, you get the odd headache from
staring into a blinding light all the time

274
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:54,564
you drive,

275
00:18:54,664 --> 00:18:55,965
But I'm sure you'll get used to that.

276
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:57,700
Aren't.

277
00:19:12,715 --> 00:19:15,752
Well, this has been a very educational day
for me.

278
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:21,024
For example, I never realized how heavy
coins are when you get enough of them.

279
00:19:22,392 --> 00:19:27,864
And in conjunction with that revelation, I
had never seen four tires blow

280
00:19:27,864 --> 00:19:35,205
simultaneously. Not to mention what the
possam van crashing to the ground can do to

281
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:36,206
an exhaust system.

282
00:19:40,109 --> 00:19:41,578
Oh, uncle, correct your back.

283
00:19:41,711 --> 00:19:44,480
I didn't hear the possum van pull up, boy,
it must be running quiet, huh?

284
00:19:45,715 --> 00:19:46,883
Not really, Harold.

285
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:50,286
I walk back from town here.

286
00:19:50,453 --> 00:19:54,324
We just got to the edge there and we ran
into a huge pocket of gravity.

287
00:19:57,026 --> 00:20:00,964
And then we had to get the van towed to
Fenty's place, and there's six hundred

288
00:20:00,964 --> 00:20:02,231
dollars damage to her.

289
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:04,934
The plot, I didn't think that was possible.

290
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:08,471
Six hundred dollars, can you afford that?

291
00:20:08,471 --> 00:20:12,008
Well, when you open up the back of the van,
he says, we got enough coin to cover it.

292
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:14,610
And I had known a couple of hours.

293
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,645
So she's shaken pretty good.

294
00:20:15,645 --> 00:20:18,648
And with all the different sized holes in
the floor, you can actually start the coins

295
00:20:18,648 --> 00:20:19,615
right in the Service Bay.

296
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,088
Right. That's incredible, you know, well,
when you figure, you know, you got all that

297
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:28,691
change, you know, from the wishing well and
tried to cash it in, which was wrong.

298
00:20:29,058 --> 00:20:31,894
But in the end, you got your man fixed, so I
guess you got your wish.

299
00:20:34,931 --> 00:20:41,337
No, I didn't. But meeting time.

300
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:43,039
You go ahead, Harold. I'll be right.

301
00:20:44,474 --> 00:20:48,711
My headaches back. Well done, my work here
is done.

302
00:20:49,746 --> 00:20:54,617
My wife is watching, I'll be coming straight
home after the meeting and OK, maybe I never

303
00:20:54,617 --> 00:20:58,254
got my wish to come true, but hey, thanks to
me, neither did your dad.

304
00:21:00,456 --> 00:21:04,127
Thanks for watching on behalf of myself and
Harold and the whole gang up here in Possum

305
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,862
Lodge. Keep your stick on the ice.

306
00:21:11,701 --> 00:21:13,169
Three, three, three.

307
00:21:14,604 --> 00:21:17,673
Let's go. Everybody, take your seats, yeah,
sit down, sit down.

308
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:19,008
All right.

309
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:25,414
Seems like there's more time now.

310
00:21:27,617 --> 00:21:35,424
By your hands for the man's fair, I'm a man,
but I can change if I have to, I guess.

311
00:21:36,525 --> 00:21:40,663
Ok, guys, Winston tells me he's still got a
bunch of coins in the tank of his septic

312
00:21:40,696 --> 00:21:42,531
truck, if any of you want to go sniff them
out.

313
00:21:52,408 --> 00:21:52,608
But.
