1
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:45,912
If you go out in the woods today, you're in
for a big surprise because you're going to

2
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:51,251
smack your face right into the red green
show, broadcasting live from the beautiful

3
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:56,122
possum lodge high up in the hinterlands
where we're coming from, you know, a small

4
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:59,626
promotional fee has been paid by several
companies in order that we do not mention

5
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:05,231
their name. And here he is, the man who's
mad about plaid, the king of canvas.

6
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:09,102
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to present a
man who really needs no introduction

7
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:13,539
whatsoever. Go ahead, I'll go ahead.

8
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,041
You don't need an introduction whatsoever.

9
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:16,776
Oh oh, all right.

10
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,245
Thank you. Hell for not mentioning my name.

11
00:01:19,812 --> 00:01:22,081
Thank you and welcome to Possum Lodge.

12
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:26,452
Harold, here is my producer and director,
which is a showbiz term meaning nephew.

13
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,492
And as my producer director, Harold's job is
what is it you do again, Harold?

14
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:33,259
Oh, I do this.

15
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,127
This is my job.

16
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,165
It's a living hell, Harold.

17
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,533
You are a talented man.

18
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,468
Well, actually, you're not a man yet.

19
00:01:42,468 --> 00:01:44,303
And the talent, it seems a little strong.

20
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:49,008
Harold, you're a multi big deal up at the
Lodge this week.

21
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,043
We've had a theft.

22
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:53,046
Our Lodge Treasurer, Douglas, he had his
pants stolen.

23
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:54,147
Not a pretty sight.

24
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,149
It sounds like a crime of passion.

25
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:57,784
Well, I don't think so, Harold.

26
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:02,121
These were lime green polyester jobs,
probably the work of one of them bad taste

27
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:06,759
posses. Now I can make jokes, but Douglas is
pretty upset about it.

28
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,762
These were his favorite pants his mum gave
him to him for his 20th birthday back in

29
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:10,930
nineteen seventy five.

30
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:16,035
So anyway, he contacted our head of
security, Noel, and he put Noel on the case.

31
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:16,969
Our head of security

32
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:19,505
Is quite a case. He's so short that he's a
briefcase.

33
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:27,680
Thank you, Harold. Anyway, Noel is just using
this as an excuse to get himself a whole

34
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,048
bunch of surveillance equipment.

35
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:32,351
Right now, he's about $5000 over his level
of comprehension.

36
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,589
But idiots with equipment is something you
see a lot of up here at the Lodge.

37
00:02:38,724 --> 00:02:39,659
As a cute Harold.

38
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:49,435
Oh, right. In

39
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:52,605
all, Lockerbie, you got camera stuffed up
inside the stuffed animal.

40
00:02:52,638 --> 00:02:54,540
What's that like Robo Smurf or something?

41
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,609
Oh no, that's for surveillance at daycare
centers.

42
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,912
Yeah. What is all this paranoid duress having
to sell?

43
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,918
I'll have, you know, the Douglas asked me to
improve the security of the lodge no matter

44
00:03:05,918 --> 00:03:10,089
of the cost. Ok, Bill Money's all wired in.

45
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:14,327
Plug that in. If you wouldn't much power up
this system and see if we get any output.

46
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,128
Carol, watch a TV monitor.

47
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:17,330
See if you can see me. Ok.

48
00:03:28,774 --> 00:03:31,577
Nothin yet. I don't think it's good to do
that.

49
00:03:37,516 --> 00:03:39,218
What did you spend $5000 on it?

50
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,621
Where is he? No, behind door number two.

51
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,925
That hurt. That's nothing.

52
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,761
What did you spend $5000 on

53
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:52,064
Security system for the lodge?

54
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:53,199
Got the deluxe model?

55
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:54,567
What? Why?

56
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:59,271
Well, you told me to, you know, last week
when your polyester pants went missing, you

57
00:03:59,271 --> 00:04:00,706
said, tighten up the security in the lodge.

58
00:04:00,706 --> 00:04:01,640
So. Huh?

59
00:04:02,174 --> 00:04:04,710
I meant a few latches on the windows.

60
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,178
A lock on the door.

61
00:04:06,378 --> 00:04:09,815
I didn't mean for you to turn this large
into dark Vader's get star.

62
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:17,756
To return this stuff right now, Mr, or I'll
have your badge.

63
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:21,961
Don't you threaten me? I know one hundred and
fifty ways to kill a man with a tuning fork,

64
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:24,063
does it?

65
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:29,001
The only threat to security around this logic
is you and bill.

66
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:34,273
No offense bill. No, I'm invoking 333 g.

67
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:34,907
I'm a large

68
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:38,744
Charter. You can't have that chart you read.

69
00:04:38,744 --> 00:04:39,645
What's he talking about?

70
00:04:40,212 --> 00:04:41,747
Oh, no, I just run the law.

71
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,082
I have no idea how it works.

72
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:47,620
I'm replacing you as head of security and
appointing an interim head of security

73
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,688
pending an internal investigation.

74
00:04:50,155 --> 00:04:51,657
Meet a coup d'etat.

75
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:53,659
I taught. I taught coup d'etat.

76
00:04:55,327 --> 00:04:56,929
I'm not giving up this job without a fight.

77
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:58,931
You don't do anything without a fight.

78
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,133
You brawl with your close every morning.

79
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:03,269
Look at you. You're a disaster.

80
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,271
This is a head of security.

81
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,339
You look like a street performer.

82
00:05:08,607 --> 00:05:11,543
The head of security looks like like this,
huh?

83
00:05:12,244 --> 00:05:13,912
This is our new head of security.

84
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:14,680
No chance.

85
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:17,950
No way. I'm I'm too busy being head of
maintenance.

86
00:05:19,284 --> 00:05:20,519
How much have you had the security?

87
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:22,187
That job requires brains.

88
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,991
Would you like to have your requirements
squeezed out your head?

89
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:31,330
No offense helmet, I'm just suggesting
possibly, you know, have you don't have the

90
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,400
cutting or maybe you're not quite as quick
as you could be?

91
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,337
No, I'm beginning to understand why you need
to learn how to defend yourself and if I

92
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:39,238
going to tell you that much, but

93
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:42,741
I'll tell you, I'm not giving up this job.

94
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:45,010
You can't have my badge badges.

95
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,179
We don't need no stinking badges.

96
00:05:48,714 --> 00:05:52,217
Raise your right hand. Ok, you're left.

97
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:57,189
One will do fine. Do you swear to uphold and
enforce the Possum Lodge rules?

98
00:05:57,723 --> 00:05:58,824
Just fix my axe.

99
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:01,160
I take that as a yes.

100
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,230
All right. I know officially proclaim you as
the temporary head of security.

101
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:19,211
If I had the wings of an angel, John, none of
my clothes would fit.

102
00:06:21,313 --> 00:06:24,650
So instead, I'll have the wings of a chicken

103
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:25,951
Walk, walk

104
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:30,122
With medium socks and a large draught.

105
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:43,402
This week in Handyman Corner, we're going to
talk about making your very own fine, highly

106
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:46,238
crafted furniture, which is something
everybody wants to do.

107
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:50,208
But then you build something and it turns
out to be a piece of crap you couldn't give

108
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,343
away at a garage sale.

109
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:56,381
Whereas building, you know, a fine heirloom
piece is something to take a little extra

110
00:06:56,381 --> 00:06:58,583
time, and it's something that can be done
within your grasp.

111
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,552
I'm guessing we got to do something like
that right here today.

112
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:03,956
We're going to take this canoe we have here,
and we're going to make it into a grandfather

113
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:08,961
clock. Ok, now the first thing we have to do
is cut the end off here because you want to

114
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,396
stand it up and it's got to be flat,
something flat to sit on.

115
00:07:11,396 --> 00:07:14,766
Now, you could cut it off a lot of different
ways you could use, I guess, the hacks on

116
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:20,639
that or you could use tin snips or you could
use a circular saw you could chew that off

117
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:22,541
you want. You could just smash it off with a
sledgehammer.

118
00:07:23,008 --> 00:07:25,143
Just keep pounding it. You could back your
van over it.

119
00:07:25,677 --> 00:07:29,848
Personally, for me, I prefer using acetylene
torch because it just works so much faster.

120
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:36,955
Acetylene torch really does the job, doesn't
it?

121
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:43,829
Now what we have to do is you need to bring
this around and flatten these out of it, of

122
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:52,938
all that. So flat, our base looks pretty
good

123
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:55,740
now, we stand her up on our wooden base,
just

124
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:07,152
we're her into place here.

125
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,724
Sticky, Peterson said. I could have just
thrown some paint cans, piled them up in here

126
00:08:12,724 --> 00:08:13,859
and the weight of them would held it in
place.

127
00:08:14,092 --> 00:08:15,360
But I don't know.

128
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,962
That's that's not the way I like to do
things.

129
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:18,396
I'm more of a detail guy.

130
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,470
Ok, OK,

131
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:36,281
now you can fancy that up with a trim or
even do a bit of sanding, you know, depending

132
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:38,016
on how valuable an heirloom you're trying to
create.

133
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:41,753
Ok, now now we need the precision timepiece.

134
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:45,790
What I do is I just sniff the whole workings
out of the clock, in the kitchen, at the

135
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,460
lodge here. It's got its own little power
pack on the back.

136
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:53,632
And to mount that on, we use the universal
clock mounting device, which you can find in

137
00:08:53,632 --> 00:09:00,639
most closets. Like so and then we just grab
a little galvanized me, although we want this

138
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,140
thing to last a long time.

139
00:09:03,108 --> 00:09:07,712
I got home to pop that in there and then
hang the clock right on there.

140
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:09,581
Twelve o'clock high.

141
00:09:10,915 --> 00:09:12,050
Ok, starting to take shape.

142
00:09:12,384 --> 00:09:16,788
Now what we need to do is to put in the
chains and the weights and the pendulum and

143
00:09:16,788 --> 00:09:20,458
all that type of thing. But the mechanism is
already on the clock.

144
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:24,562
So these things are strictly cosmetic, which
is a decorator term for fake.

145
00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:30,502
So we use these chains and we need some
pieces of Dowling.

146
00:09:31,069 --> 00:09:34,606
But I don't have pieces of Dowling and I'm
not interested in buying pieces of Dowling,

147
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:37,208
but I do have an old, an old paddle here.

148
00:09:41,012 --> 00:09:45,350
Now, Harold always tells me that gold is
worth a lot more than silver, so I'm painting

149
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:50,188
her gold. That should be about 18 carats
worth, huh?

150
00:09:51,656 --> 00:09:52,891
I'll just wait till it dries.

151
00:09:56,594 --> 00:09:57,595
Good enough, so

152
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:04,235
Now we take this over and I put a hook in
behind the clock, so we hang hang the chain

153
00:10:04,235 --> 00:10:08,706
from the hook. One man's meat is another
man's hanging clock.

154
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:13,311
There we go. Now what we need to do is to
add some sort of a pendulum.

155
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:17,549
What I've done is I took the anchor out of
the fishing boat.

156
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:19,551
I don't want to drift too far.

157
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:21,019
The wind's not. Not too bad today.

158
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,557
Can't catch up later on. Oh, well, now we
hang this.

159
00:10:26,391 --> 00:10:27,959
Hang this rig up in here as well.

160
00:10:29,861 --> 00:10:34,465
And there we've got our whole phony looking
mechanism now that really top it off here.

161
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:40,705
You can put some plastic wrap across the
canoe and it gives it kind of a leaded glass

162
00:10:40,705 --> 00:10:42,340
look, or you could just leave it open.

163
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,177
But at this point, I'm not about to cheapen
off first class all the way.

164
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:52,450
And there you have it.

165
00:10:54,152 --> 00:10:56,220
Very own beautiful grandfather clock.

166
00:10:56,387 --> 00:10:59,324
A little bit wrinkled, but then again, so
his grandfather.

167
00:10:59,957 --> 00:11:04,295
And if you don't like the aluminum look, you
could cover that with a wood grain or

168
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:06,698
simulated leather or whatever Mac that comes
in.

169
00:11:08,132 --> 00:11:11,169
You can also get some doorknobs, you know,
to put on the points and the stuff sticking

170
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:12,236
out. And it's up to you.

171
00:11:12,236 --> 00:11:15,239
But I'll tell you one thing you've got a one
of a kind here.

172
00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:19,644
So remember, if the women don't find you
handsome, they should at least find your

173
00:11:19,644 --> 00:11:25,483
handy. Does that every hour on the hour?

174
00:11:27,418 --> 00:11:29,287
So that's the way they want to play it?

175
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:31,322
Well, I'll go in the car.

176
00:11:31,756 --> 00:11:33,124
That's right. That's fine.

177
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:35,226
I'm not going quietly.

178
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:49,040
It is spring.

179
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:50,775
The river is raging.

180
00:11:51,242 --> 00:11:53,010
Our gill nets are strung across it.

181
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:55,947
We wind them in to examine our catch.

182
00:11:56,481 --> 00:11:59,717
Three canoes for lawn chairs, eight tool
sheds in the dock.

183
00:12:00,618 --> 00:12:02,920
You can make money in this business and you
know where to fish.

184
00:12:09,193 --> 00:12:12,029
I'll tell you things around here have gone
from bad to weird.

185
00:12:12,663 --> 00:12:17,735
No skulking around plotting revenge and
saying that everybody's out to get them, you

186
00:12:17,735 --> 00:12:21,339
know, and they took his strawberries and
helmets turned out to be a worse security

187
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:25,543
guard than Noel. Helmet ever was easy going,
but now he's turned into Jason's evil

188
00:12:25,543 --> 00:12:28,412
brother. You see a sign of diagram, Harold.

189
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:32,817
I can only hope he's out at a job interview
anyway.

190
00:12:33,584 --> 00:12:37,488
Helmet put a sign up in the dining room says
No shirt, no shoes, no consciousness.

191
00:12:38,222 --> 00:12:39,890
And he gave us a whole list of rules.

192
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:43,027
Incredible stuff like no picking your teeth
with cutlery.

193
00:12:43,427 --> 00:12:44,595
Since when did we get cutlery?

194
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:46,364
There's a whole bunch of rules like that.

195
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:51,202
And if you look past the spelling, you can
see Douglas's simple mind at work there.

196
00:12:51,369 --> 00:12:53,838
So I think what I have to do is go down and
have a word with helmets.

197
00:12:53,838 --> 00:12:57,274
So, Harold, why don't you just get on with
the show here, Aaron?

198
00:12:58,609 --> 00:13:02,980
All right. All right. Oh boy.

199
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:09,286
Oh boy, oh boy, did I do that?

200
00:13:10,454 --> 00:13:20,431
It's kind of neat. Now, let me read I wanted
to talk to you about this live

201
00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:21,465
security business.

202
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:24,902
Oh, Douglas told me not to discuss large
security with anybody.

203
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:28,939
Did you know that anyone could just drive up
here and walk into the lodge even if they

204
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:29,640
weren't members?

205
00:13:30,407 --> 00:13:31,809
Yeah. Well, nobody ever does that helmet.

206
00:13:31,842 --> 00:13:33,711
Not not even members of our own families.

207
00:13:34,678 --> 00:13:35,212
You're right.

208
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,381
My mom's never been here.

209
00:13:37,915 --> 00:13:39,283
Never even seen the place.

210
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,853
You know, she went through twenty eight
hours of labor to give birth to me.

211
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,355
No, I didn't know that.

212
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:46,490
Yeah. Twenty eight hours of screaming.

213
00:13:47,491 --> 00:13:49,860
Well, I'm not surprised you're so big.

214
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,629
The doctors probably had to make two trips.

215
00:13:52,796 --> 00:13:53,964
Let me think pretty handsome woman.

216
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:58,102
All right. Nice tattoo.

217
00:13:58,569 --> 00:13:59,803
There you should see her in color.

218
00:13:59,803 --> 00:14:04,808
And someday you will as soon as this place
is clean and suitable for mom and Douglas.

219
00:14:05,543 --> 00:14:08,178
Yeah, helmet vote all these new rules.

220
00:14:08,712 --> 00:14:11,282
A lot of the guys think that you're really
cramping our style here.

221
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:17,788
Well, we have to make this place clean and
suitable for our moms to come up and visit

222
00:14:17,888 --> 00:14:20,858
that. Wouldn't that be nice? Wouldn't you
love to have your mom up here and maybe even

223
00:14:20,858 --> 00:14:21,558
your mother in law?

224
00:14:22,626 --> 00:14:24,762
Well, I spend a lot more time at home, that's
for sure.

225
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,431
Something to be honest here.

226
00:14:27,831 --> 00:14:30,034
Are you really enjoying this large security
job?

227
00:14:31,535 --> 00:14:33,203
No, not, not really.

228
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,972
I miss servicing my pump.

229
00:14:35,706 --> 00:14:37,708
I haven't filled her grease caps all day.

230
00:14:38,876 --> 00:14:40,411
You know, nobody wants to be the heavy.

231
00:14:40,577 --> 00:14:41,712
I don't want to be the heavy.

232
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:43,280
I don't think anybody likes being there.

233
00:14:44,181 --> 00:14:46,750
Well, how come you're going around making
everybody's life so miserable in?

234
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:52,256
Well, Douglas told me that if I fail as head
of security at the Lodge, that I'd bring

235
00:14:52,256 --> 00:14:58,395
shame to my family and my mom, and I want my
mom to be proud of me.

236
00:14:59,797 --> 00:15:01,865
Well, I don't want to come between you and
your mother helmet.

237
00:15:02,099 --> 00:15:03,233
Not without my pads on.

238
00:15:08,238 --> 00:15:10,707
Now, here's a clue to this week's adventures
with Bill.

239
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,709
A great big pile of rocks.

240
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,245
You guessed it yet. Think about it.

241
00:15:19,216 --> 00:15:23,020
You've got a dog house and a ladder, and we
got a kid's playpen in a garbage can.

242
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,389
But we're going to do is, of course, build a
catapult.

243
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,526
Now Bill gets down there with the garbage
can.

244
00:15:29,893 --> 00:15:31,628
He's duct tape and that on to one end of a
ladder.

245
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:34,464
And that's going to be where he goes.

246
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:39,970
And on the other end, I'm tying the kid's
playpen as one of those old wooden ones that

247
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,405
I must've had a kid with a big head.

248
00:15:41,438 --> 00:15:42,673
He's probably going to kill himself in that
thing.

249
00:15:43,974 --> 00:15:45,509
I'm tying that on to the other end.

250
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,112
So Bill's got that pretty damn, pretty well
done there.

251
00:15:49,146 --> 00:15:50,314
The handyman secret weapon.

252
00:15:50,314 --> 00:15:55,419
Now he takes a little piece of rope and he
takes this off, and this is basically going

253
00:15:55,419 --> 00:16:00,424
to be the trigger of the catapult because as
long as it's tight around that heavy log

254
00:16:00,424 --> 00:16:03,060
that's rooted right into the forest there,
then it's not going to call.

255
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:08,565
So he he climbs into the garbage can, which
seemed extremely appropriate to me, and I put

256
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:11,835
the rocks in here because what's happening
is the ladders bending, bending way down.

257
00:16:11,868 --> 00:16:15,172
So eventually the whole playpen sitting
right on the ground with all the weight and

258
00:16:15,172 --> 00:16:16,974
the ladder is bent right around almost
double.

259
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:21,712
There's a lot of spring in that thing and a
lot of tension that's really pulling up on

260
00:16:21,712 --> 00:16:28,018
the rope. Now I got to do is I got to cut
the rope and we had brought an axe along to

261
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:29,119
cut the rope on it.

262
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:31,088
I don't know where the axe is.

263
00:16:31,955 --> 00:16:34,024
Oh, I'm not

264
00:16:34,024 --> 00:16:36,259
Going to ask, so I cut the rope and their
goal.

265
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:43,600
Oh, my God. Oh, that's great back into the
cannon that launched

266
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,835
The rocks from the other end.

267
00:16:46,303 --> 00:16:48,271
I noticed Iraq Soledad before a building.

268
00:16:49,072 --> 00:16:54,845
Finally. Oh, oh, oh, Bill.

269
00:16:54,878 --> 00:16:56,446
But these are these are industry.

270
00:16:57,214 --> 00:16:58,448
Some of the rocks out there and.

271
00:17:00,784 --> 00:17:04,087
It seems OK, although he looks a little
pale.

272
00:17:20,303 --> 00:17:25,208
Now that I have things around here have gone
from worst bratwurst and it rules about where

273
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:29,246
you can sit, where you can walk, you can't
talk too loud, you can't whisper to anybody.

274
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,083
As far as I'm concerned, everybody has been
stripped totally of all of their rights,

275
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,117
every last single and

276
00:17:34,117 --> 00:17:36,019
Back until I'm ready to do my job.

277
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,255
Oh hi, Harold. Where's my axe?

278
00:17:38,288 --> 00:17:39,623
My axe is gone. Someone stole my axe.

279
00:17:39,623 --> 00:17:41,525
You're wearing and you're wearing it.

280
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:42,425
Would you do it? Don't break it.

281
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:43,660
Ok, it's fine.

282
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,463
Apple Watch this thing.

283
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:47,631
No problem.

284
00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:49,699
Oh, you can do that now to Kenya.

285
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:53,937
Well, and back, you know, your producer
slash director is here to do my job.

286
00:17:54,104 --> 00:17:55,639
Oh no. Oh, Harold. Harold, we've been get
along.

287
00:17:55,872 --> 00:18:01,645
Fine without you. Anyway, as I was saying,
as far as I'm concerned, Possum Lodge has

288
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:05,282
turned into Orwell's nineteen eighty four
marked down to nine ninety five.

289
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:08,118
You weather is real nice.

290
00:18:08,151 --> 00:18:09,719
We have to say that even if there's a
hurricane,

291
00:18:11,087 --> 00:18:12,155
Can I give you a hand with this?

292
00:18:12,322 --> 00:18:13,657
No, I'm fine. I'm fine, really.

293
00:18:14,824 --> 00:18:18,495
I figure that it's going to be a huge revolt
at tonight's Lodge meeting and probably going

294
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,530
to end up with, you know, people getting
their jobs back.

295
00:18:20,563 --> 00:18:21,798
Everybody, you know, bigger.

296
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:23,767
No, no. I figured just no helmet

297
00:18:26,302 --> 00:18:28,805
Off as the phone. So how you been getting
along with me?

298
00:18:28,838 --> 00:18:30,407
How are you coping? It's good.

299
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:31,641
It's good. Can I give a hand with that?

300
00:18:31,808 --> 00:18:34,911
Oh no, I'm fine. I don't mind helping with
that because hail,

301
00:18:34,911 --> 00:18:36,179
Hail, hail to go to the meeting.

302
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:38,882
Ok, I'm going to get brainwashed brainwash.

303
00:18:39,215 --> 00:18:43,086
Do you really good? Great.

304
00:18:43,153 --> 00:18:44,320
Great. Great.

305
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,628
Great. Yeah.

306
00:18:53,196 --> 00:18:56,800
Oh. My my.

307
00:19:02,806 --> 00:19:04,107
I'm sorry, red.

308
00:19:04,974 --> 00:19:10,380
I'm invoking the emergency clause of the
large charter, which means I'll be running

309
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,615
this meeting, you might not correct.

310
00:19:14,884 --> 00:19:23,593
Fine. What I know about me is.

311
00:19:28,698 --> 00:19:30,700
Did I say you may sit?

312
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:33,770
Yeah, you did right after, did I say,

313
00:19:35,738 --> 00:19:38,174
Oh, OK,

314
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:41,711
Well, let's not beat around the bush today.

315
00:19:41,711 --> 00:19:43,913
Phil is our first order of business.

316
00:19:43,947 --> 00:19:45,281
No Christmas.

317
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:52,288
Our former head of security, spent five
thousand of large money on a surveillance

318
00:19:52,288 --> 00:19:56,893
system which randomly explodes, showering us
all with singe teddy bear stuffing.

319
00:19:59,162 --> 00:20:06,002
Now, now I feel very strongly that Noel
should pay for it and or be expelled from the

320
00:20:06,002 --> 00:20:08,838
lodge. All those in favor on the.

321
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,242
I think we've got a bigger issue than that to
vote on.

322
00:20:14,243 --> 00:20:21,284
Now I've collected an extensive list of
complaints against helmet lights carry.

323
00:20:22,518 --> 00:20:27,724
Some weren't even mine, so I say we vote to
return things back to the way they were.

324
00:20:28,224 --> 00:20:30,793
Yes. Yeah, I think that's a great idea.

325
00:20:30,827 --> 00:20:33,529
It is. It is. So but that's including my job
too.

326
00:20:33,896 --> 00:20:35,231
Yeah, I second that motion.

327
00:20:35,498 --> 00:20:37,433
You know, I had a vote.

328
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:38,901
I would do that because

329
00:20:38,901 --> 00:20:40,670
I don't have a vote. I think it's okay.

330
00:20:42,672 --> 00:20:44,140
Just a minute or something like that.

331
00:20:45,508 --> 00:20:46,943
Not many people

332
00:20:47,577 --> 00:20:49,045
Haven't thought of it. Shut up.

333
00:20:51,714 --> 00:20:56,719
Now there'll be no vote and there'll be no
discussion and no one will leave this place

334
00:20:56,719 --> 00:21:02,024
until I get my pants back their lime green
polyester, and they're very difficult to

335
00:21:02,024 --> 00:21:02,658
replace.

336
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:05,261
Try the rag in the car wash.

337
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:15,071
Lime green, I took those bands home, what I
thought they were ladies slack, so I gave it

338
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:18,341
to my mom, but they didn't really fit her
until she let the crotch out on them.

339
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:19,308
And now they look quite good.

340
00:21:19,842 --> 00:21:20,309
I gave my

341
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:21,611
Birthday pants to your mother.

342
00:21:21,644 --> 00:21:23,312
Oh, calm down, I can bring them back.

343
00:21:23,646 --> 00:21:25,514
I don't want them now that your mother's
worn them.

344
00:21:26,949 --> 00:21:28,017
What's wrong with my mother?

345
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:31,487
You're saying there's something wrong with my
mother?

346
00:21:33,022 --> 00:21:33,656
No, no.

347
00:21:34,357 --> 00:21:35,625
Me in your dreams.

348
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:45,835
Get up. For

349
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:53,542
all those in favor of reinstating me as head
of security, say, I thank you very much.

350
00:21:54,577 --> 00:21:59,882
Oh, and all those in favor of reinstating
red as leader of Possum Lodge J.R..

351
00:22:00,116 --> 00:22:06,789
Well, hey, welcome back Bret Michael and all
those in favor of reinstating me.

352
00:22:06,822 --> 00:22:11,494
As you know, the special effects technician
on the Red Green Show say I just.

353
00:22:13,663 --> 00:22:14,730
You say out loud you want

354
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:22,271
All those in favor of reinstating me as head
of large maintenance say, I thank God I was

355
00:22:22,271 --> 00:22:23,339
really getting tired of playing the

356
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:23,739
Heavy.

357
00:22:25,341 --> 00:22:30,679
Well, since there's nobody left to reinstate,
I call on Douglas to supply the evening's

358
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:32,248
entertainment. That's.

359
00:22:38,921 --> 00:22:41,857
Thank you all.

360
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:49,598
Well, fellas, my topic for today is knowing
your own limitations.

361
00:22:50,065 --> 00:22:52,868
Well, there you see a democracy in action.

362
00:22:52,902 --> 00:22:55,271
Well, I should say Noel in action.

363
00:22:55,337 --> 00:22:56,872
Actions speak louder than words.

364
00:22:57,006 --> 00:22:58,774
And take a heck of a lot less horsepower.

365
00:22:59,275 --> 00:23:02,745
Anyway, Douglas is not too happy, but the
people have spoken, albeit rather

366
00:23:02,745 --> 00:23:08,083
incoherently. But we're all gone back now to
being free, man, although you really are

367
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:09,285
never truly free, are you?

368
00:23:09,318 --> 00:23:13,022
And speaking of which, if my wife is
watching, I'll be coming straight home after

369
00:23:13,022 --> 00:23:16,725
the meeting tonight, and I really I'm really
glad that our marriage is a democracy, even

370
00:23:16,725 --> 00:23:18,027
if you do have nine votes.

371
00:23:18,661 --> 00:23:24,033
So until next time, on behalf of myself and
possibly Harold and the rest of the gang up

372
00:23:24,033 --> 00:23:25,034
here at Possum Lodge?

373
00:23:25,234 --> 00:23:26,235
Keep your stick on the ice.

374
00:23:35,678 --> 00:23:38,681
Well, the me man hurt you, my precious baby,
huh?

375
00:23:39,248 --> 00:23:45,387
Oh. That's.
