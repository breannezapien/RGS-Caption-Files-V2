IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW!"

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,078
AND HERE HE IS NOW,

3
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,346
A MAN WHO ONCE YELLED...

4
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:14,881
"WAITER, THERE'S A
FLY IN MY PANTS."

5
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:17,183
YOUR HOST,
MY HERO,
UNCLE RED,

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,085
UNCLE RED GREEN.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

8
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:30,697
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

9
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:31,765
THANK YOU.

10
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:32,899
APPRECIATE IT.

11
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,101
BOY, I HAD A ROUGH DAY
AT THE LODGE YESTERDAY.

12
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:38,271
BUSTER AND I WERE DRAGGED UP
TO THIS NEW MALL BY OUR WIVES.

13
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:39,372
NEW MALL?
YEAH.

14
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,573
YOU WERE UP AT
THE NEW MALL?
YEAH.

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,674
YOU WENT TO THE NEW MALL?
THE ONE AT PORT ASBESTOS?

16
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:42,909
THAT NEW MALL?

17
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,210
THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE
SO COOL UP THERE.

18
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:45,411
THEY'VE GOT, LIKE,
A MUSIC STORE.

19
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:47,647
THEY'VE EVEN GOT A GAP.

20
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:51,985
WELL, HAROLD, EVERYBODY
AT POSSUM LODGE HAS
A GAP SOMEWHERE.

21
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,320
I TELL YOU, EVERY MALL HAS
THREE THINGS THE SAME...

22
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,455
CLOTHES, STORES

23
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:58,224
AND BENCHES FOR
THE HUSBANDS TO SIT ON.

24
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,059
I WISH I KNEW YOU
WERE GOING TO THE MALL.

25
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,761
I REALLY  WISH --
CAN I GO WITH YOU
NEXT TIME YOU GO?

26
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,663
WELL, THERE'S NOT GOING
TO BE A NEXT TIME, HAROLD.

27
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,833
YEAH, BUSTER AND I
WERE BANNED FROM THE MALL.

28
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,134
WHAT DID HE
DO THIS TIME?

29
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:09,435
WELL, I DON'T BLAME
HIM SO MUCH.

30
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:11,237
WE WERE BORED,
WE WERE TIRED,

31
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:15,308
AND THEY SHOULD NEVER SERVE BEER
ANYWHERE THERE'S A FOUNTAIN.

32
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,678
I'LL TELL YOU THOUGH, HAROLD,
I DON'T EVEN CARE ABOUT THAT

33
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,980
BECAUSE THAT MALL HAS
NO HARDWARE STORE,

34
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,415
NO CAR DEALERSHIP.

35
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:23,983
THERE'S NOTHING
I WANT THERE.

36
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,586
WELL, YOU CAN BUY
THAT KIND OF STUFF
DOWNTOWN POSSUM LAKE.

37
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,888
BUT DOWNTOWN POSSUM LAKE
DOESN'T HAVE A MALL.

38
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:30,490
SEE, THE LADIES LIKE
TO GO TO A MALL.

39
00:01:30,556 --> 00:01:31,991
WAIT A SEC.
WHAT?

40
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:35,428
WE CAN TURN DOWNTOWN
POSSUM LAKE INTO A MALL.

41
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,697
WELL...
YEAH, YEAH.

42
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,466
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S
ALREADY BEEN MAULED SO --

43
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:45,672
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE
A BUNCH OF RANDOMLY LOCATED
SHOPS AND STORES AND HOVELS

44
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:48,408
AND TURN THEM INTO
A HI-TECH ENCLOSED MALL?

45
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:50,009
WELL, I DON'T KNOW, HAROLD,

46
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:51,477
BUT THAT DOESN'T STOP
ME FROM TRYING.

47
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:54,047
NO, BUT IT STOPS YOU
FROM SUCCEEDING.

[QUIRKY UPBEAT MUSIC]

ON THIS WEEK'S SHOW BILL
IS GOING TO TRY SKATING,

50
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:04,390
GOING TO GO WELL I'M GUESSING.

51
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,427
I'M GOING TO CONVERT THE
POSSUM VAN TO RUN ON PROPANE,

52
00:02:07,493 --> 00:02:08,961
FOR A WHILE.

53
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:11,764
HAROLD'S GOT A DOUBLE-BARRELED
SLINGSHOT THERE BY THE
LOOK OF 'ER,

54
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:15,401
AND ARNIE HAS
A MEDICAL PROBLEM.

55

MERCHANTS ARE ALL
EXCITED ABOUT IT.

I GUESS THEY
HAVE WIVES TOO.

57
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:27,547
UNCLE RED, WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO, LIKE, PUT A DOME OVER
THE ENTIRE DOWNTOWN AREA?

58
00:02:27,613 --> 00:02:31,217
YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER, LIKE,
YOU GUYS AREN'T ARCHITECTS OR
BUILDERS OR ENGINEERS.

59
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,119
YOU'RE MORE LIKE THE --

60
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,888
YOU GUYS ARE MORE LIKE THE
PEOPLE WHO HOLD THINGS...

61
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,558
FOR THE GUY WHO
KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.

62
00:02:38,624 --> 00:02:40,393
AND THIS GUY
AIN'T COMING.

63
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:42,028
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

64
00:02:42,094 --> 00:02:44,030
DON'T WORRY, HAROLD,
THIS PLAN IS FOOL PROOF.

65
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,398
TELL ME THIS.

66
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:47,066
WHAT IS THE MOST APPEALING
PART OF AN INDOOR MALL?

67
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,134
THE STORES.

68
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,635
NO, FLAVOURED POPCORN.

69
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,204
NO, BABES.

70
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,738
BABES,
BABES,
BABES,

71
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:53,873
NO.
OH, YEAH!

72
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,375
NO, NO.
YES, YES.

73
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:57,710
THE CONVENIENCE, HAROLD,

74
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,812
THE ABILITY TO GO FROM STORE TO
STORE WITHOUT GOING OUTSIDE.

75
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,347
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A FOUNTAIN.
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A FOUNTAIN.

76
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:02,715
'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE ALL
THE TEENAGERS HANG OUT

77
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:05,751
WHERE THERE'S BABES.

78
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:08,688
I'LL BE GETTING
RIGHT ON THAT, HAROLD.

79
00:03:08,754 --> 00:03:12,792
SO THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU
ATTACH THE STORES TOGETHER
WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH A
LIMITED BUDGET?

80
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:14,327
DUCT TAPE?
NO, NO.

81
00:03:14,393 --> 00:03:16,228
OH, GOOD.

82
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:18,064
HAROLD, YOU'RE GOING
TO LOVE THIS.

83
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,533
THE STORES ARE ALREADY
ATTACHED TOGETHER.

84
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,801
HUH?

85
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:24,737
THROUGH THE STORM SEWERS.

86
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,347
STORM SEWERS.

87
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:36,215
I KNEW YOU'D LIKE IT.
OH, YEAH, I'M LOVING IT.
I'M LOVING IT.

88
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,484
YOU GO INTO A STORE,
YOU GO DOWN INTO THE BASEMENT,

89
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:44,724
YOU DROP INTO THE SEWER AND YOU
STROLL ALONG IN CONCRETE-LINED
COMFORT TO THE NEXT SHOP.

90
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,160
THE MALL IS PRE-BUILT.
THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT.

91
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:49,428
WELL, IF THAT'S
THE BEAUTY OF IT,

92
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,498
I DON'T WANT TO
KNOW THE UGLY PART.

93
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:57,570
OH, HAVE YOU EVER HAD A
DREAM YOU WERE FALLING

94
00:03:57,636 --> 00:03:58,938
FALLING

95
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:01,273
WELL CHANCES ARE YOU
WEREN'T REALLY FALLING

96
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,575
FALLING

97
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:05,211
UNLESS YOU FELL
ASLEEP SKYDIVIING

98
00:04:05,277 --> 00:04:06,946
SKYDIVING

99

AND THAT'S NOT REALLY
RECOMMENDED

100
00:04:09,381 --> 00:04:12,785
IF YOU'D READ
THE INSTRUCTIONS
YOU'D KNOW THAT

A ROAD MAP OF EUROPE!

108
00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:32,037
YOU CAN FIND ANYTHING.

109
00:04:32,104 --> 00:04:37,376
UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO GET Mr. DALTON HUMPHREY
TO SAY THIS WORD.

110
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,677
"ACCIDENT."

111
00:04:39,678 --> 00:04:40,713
"ACCIDENT."

112
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:42,848
OKAY, GO!

113
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,483
OKAY, DALTON,
MISTAKE...?

114
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,653
MARRYING YOUNG.

115
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,821
DISASTER...?

116
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,657
MARRYING LATER
IN LIFE.

117
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,525
ALL RIGHT, REMEMBER A
COUPLE OF DAYS AGO,

118
00:04:53,592 --> 00:04:55,227
YOUR DAUGHTER BUMPED
INTO YOUR PIGGY BANK,

119
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:56,695
SMASHED IT
ON THE FLOOR.

120
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:58,898
THAT WAS AN...?
OMEN.

121
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:00,966
OKAY, TWO YEARS BACK NOW,

122
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:02,501
REMEMBER YOUR DAUGHTER'S IN
THE BACK SEAT OF THAT CAR.

123
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:03,769
SHE HAD THAT TERRIBLE...?

124
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:06,438
MARRIAGE PROPOSAL.

125
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:08,907
NO, FIVE YEARS --
FIVE YEARS BACK.

126
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:11,210
REMEMBER SHE
CRASHED YOUR PINTO.

127
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:12,678
INSURANCE FRAUD.

128
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,513
THEY NEVER PROVED THAT!
THEY NEVER PROVED THAT!

129
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,681
ALMOST OUT OF TIME.

130
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,416
JUST KEEP GOING
TO SAVE YOURSELF.

131
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,752
ALL RIGHT YOUR DAUGHTER
24 YEARS AGO...?

132
00:05:19,818 --> 00:05:21,053
OH, AN ACCIDENT.

133
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,591
(FRANTIC BELL RINGING)

134
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,261
THERE WAS NOTHING
ON TV LAST NIGHT,

135
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:30,929
AT LEAST NOTHING
THAT I WANTED TO WATCH,

136
00:05:30,996 --> 00:05:33,532
SO I ENDED UP AT THE
KITCHEN TABLE TRYING
TO PAY A FEW BILLS.

137
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,234
I'M LOOKING AT MY
CREDIT CARD STATEMENT.

138
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,003
I COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW
MUCH I SPEND ON GASOLINE.

139
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,505
I BLAME IT ON TWO THINGS...

140
00:05:39,571 --> 00:05:41,640
THE GAS MILEAGE
OF THE POSSUM VAN,

141
00:05:41,707 --> 00:05:45,310
AND THE FACT THAT ALL THE
OTHER LODGE MEMBERS HAVE
LOCKING GAS CAPS.

142
00:05:45,377 --> 00:05:48,180
SO THIS WEEK ON
HANDYMAN CORNER,

143
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:49,948
I'M GOING TO CONVERT
THE POSSUM VAN

144
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:51,784
(CRASH!)

145
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,655
TO RUN ON PROPANE.

146
00:05:56,722 --> 00:05:57,890
YOU KNOW, IT'S CHEAPER,

147
00:05:57,956 --> 00:05:59,158
IT'S CLEANER,

148
00:05:59,224 --> 00:06:00,993
AND IT'S MUCH MORE
READILY AVAILABLE

149
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:05,697
BECAUSE SO FAR, THEY
HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT HOW TO PUT
A LOCKING GAS CAP ON A BARBEQUE.

150
00:06:05,764 --> 00:06:09,802
FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO
IS MOUNT THE PROPANE TANKS
ON YOUR VEHICLE.

151
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:13,405
I SAY JUST PUT THEM ON
THERE LIKE SADDLEBAGS.

152
00:06:13,472 --> 00:06:15,307
I MEAN, THIS HERE IS MY HORSE,

153
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:17,209
200 HORSE ACTUALLY.

154
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,811
YOU'LL NEED
A LOT OF SADDLEBAGS,

155
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:20,979
SORT OF LIKE MOOSE THOMPSON.

156
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:25,651
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS GET A
HUNK OF CHAIN, PUT A PROPANE
TANK ON EACH END

157
00:06:25,717 --> 00:06:27,452
AND THEN JUST DRAPE
THAT OVER YOUR VEHICLE.

158
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,958
(EXPLOSION)

159
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:35,627
EASY, BIG FELLA.

160
00:06:35,694 --> 00:06:37,029
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO GET A FEW TANKS.

161
00:06:37,095 --> 00:06:38,463
YOU MAY GO THROUGH SOME.

162
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:42,901
ALL RIGHT, ONCE YOU GET
THE TANKS ON THERE,

163
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:46,305
YOU COULD CONNECT THE PROPANE TO
THE ENGINE USING THE PROPER
FITTINGS AND COUPLINGS,

164
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:48,440
IF YOU'RE MADE OF MONEY...

165
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:52,711
BUT, HECK, IF YOU'RE THAT RICH
YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE RUNNING
ON GASOLINE AND FORGET
THE WHOLE DEAL.

166
00:06:52,778 --> 00:06:55,948
SO I RECOMMEND YOU GO
WITH REGULAR GARDEN HOSE.

167
00:06:56,014 --> 00:06:58,317
ALL RIGHT, NOW, PROBABLY SOME OF
YOU MIGHT BE GETTING A LITTLE
SKEPTICAL AT THIS POINT.

168
00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:00,385
LIKE, MY DAD USED TO SAY,

169
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:03,655
"YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T MIX
RIGHT-HAND AND LEFT-HAND
THREAD CONNECTORS."

170
00:07:03,722 --> 00:07:06,925
HE NEVER KNEW ABOUT
THE HANDYMAN SECRET ADAPTOR!

171
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:09,695
SO JUST TAKE OFF AS MUCH OF
GARDEN HOSE AS YOU NEED
TO CONNECT --

172
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:12,931
OH, GEEZ, FROZEN HERE.

173
00:07:12,998 --> 00:07:14,599
THAT'S A START I GUESS.

174
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,735
ALL RIGHT, NOW, WE'RE HMM --

175
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:21,707
OKAY, WE'RE ABOUT
READY TO GO HERE.

176
00:07:21,773 --> 00:07:24,242
GOT ALL THE HOSES RUNNING RIGHT
DOWN INTO THE CARBURETOR.

177
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:26,411
AND THEN I TAKE THIS
BARBEQUE STARTER,

178
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:27,913
JAM THAT IN THROUGH THE GRILL,

179
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:30,215
AND WHEN I FIRE THAT UP
THE WHOLE UNIT SHOULD GO.

180
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:33,552
OKAY, ALL I'VE GOT TO DO NOW
IS OPEN ALL THE VALVES ON
THE PROPANE TANKS,

181
00:07:33,618 --> 00:07:36,054
AND WE SHOULD BE READY
TO HIT THE ROAD.

182
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:38,724
RUSTY HERE.

183
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,893
YOU KNOW, FOR SAFETY SAKE THERE,
YOU MIGHT WANT TO LEAVE ONE
OF THE VALVES CLOSED.

184
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,063
YOU KNOW, IF YOU RUN OUT
OF PROPANE YOU'LL HAVE
A LITTLE EXTRA,

185
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,665
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE
CONSERVATIVE.

186
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,400
MIND YOU, IF YOU'RE
THAT CONSERVATIVE,

187
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:52,370
PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO DO
THIS PROJECT IN THE FIRST PLACE.

188
00:07:52,437 --> 00:07:55,006
DAMN, SMELL THAT PROPANE.

189
00:07:56,007 --> 00:08:01,012
IF YOU'RE A SMOKER NOW YOU MIGHT
WANT TO EXTINGUISH YOUR BUTT
WHILE YOU STILL HAVE ONE.

190
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:04,082
OKAY, THEY'RE ALL WIDE OPEN.

191
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:06,551
LET'S JUST FIRE IT UP.

192
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:10,989
MAN, I MUST HAVE
LEFT 'ER IN GEAR.

193
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:13,024
SO REMEMBER, IF WOMEN DON'T
FIND YOU HANDSOME,

194
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:14,426
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

195
00:08:20,131 --> 00:08:23,335
(EXPLOSION)

196
00:08:29,174 --> 00:08:32,177
I WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE AND TALK
TO YOU OLDER FELLOWS OUT THERE.

197
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:35,113
THERE IS A NEW TREND
GOING ON NOW FOR MEN.

198
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,817
IT'S CALLED
"SHARE YOUR FEELINGS."

199
00:08:38,883 --> 00:08:42,721
ESPECIALLY "SHARE YOUR FEELINGS
WITH YOUR PARTNER FOR LIFE,"

200
00:08:42,787 --> 00:08:46,324
AND I DON'T MEAN
YOUR BEER GUT.

201
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:48,560
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A
GREAT IDEA, DOESN'T IT?

202
00:08:48,627 --> 00:08:50,562
SHARING YOUR FEELINGS,

203
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:52,731
MAKE YOUR
RELATIONSHIP STRONGER,

204
00:08:52,797 --> 00:08:55,634
MAYBE MAKE THE TWO OF
YOU GET CLOSER TOGETHER.

205
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,203
BUT I'D JUST LIKE TO PUT
THE BRAKES ON THAT

206
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:00,772
RIGHT HERE,
RIGHT NOW.

207
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,843
YOU KNOW HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS
SHE SAYS AND DOES,

208
00:09:04,909 --> 00:09:08,713
AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'D
LIKE TO TELL HER.

209
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:14,452
OKAY, THESE ARE FEELINGS
THAT SHOULD NOT BE SHARED.

210
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,322
WHEN SHE ASKS YOU
WHAT YOU'RE FEELING,

211
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:20,091
FOR GOSH SAKE,
DON'T LISTEN TO YOURSELF.

212
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:24,295
JUST PUT YOUR HEAD DOWN,
TELL HER WHAT SHE NEEDS TO HEAR.

213
00:09:24,362 --> 00:09:28,199
IF YOU HAVE OTHER FEELINGS THAT
NEED TO BE EXPRESSED TO SOME
LIVING CREATURE,

214
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:31,870
HEY, THAT'S WHAT
DOGS ARE FOR.

215
00:09:31,936 --> 00:09:34,305
NOW, I'M NOT ASKING
YOU TO LIE,

216
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:36,474
JUST PICK AND CHOOSE.

217
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,778
'CAUSE IF YOU TELL HER HOW YOU
FEEL ABOUT WHAT SHE DOES,

218
00:09:39,844 --> 00:09:44,449
THERE'S A REAL DANGER SHE'S
GOING TO DO THE SAME
THING BACK TO YOU,

219
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:48,153
AND YOU'RE JUST NOT
STRONG ENOUGH FOR THAT.

220
00:09:48,219 --> 00:09:52,924
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

221
00:09:58,163 --> 00:10:02,167
WELL, OPERATION INDOOR MALL
IS REALLY PICKING UP SPEED.

222
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:04,569
WE DID HAVE THE ONE SETBACK.

223
00:10:04,636 --> 00:10:07,005
MOOSE THOMPSON GOT WEDGED
DOWN IN THE SEWER THERE

224
00:10:07,071 --> 00:10:12,677
HALFWAY BETWEEN THE BAGEL SHOP
AND THE KIELBASA COTTAGE.

225
00:10:12,744 --> 00:10:14,445
AND WE WENT DOWN TO
LOOK FOR HIM THERE,

226
00:10:14,512 --> 00:10:16,581
AND HE LIT A MATCH
TO SHOW US WHERE HE WAS,

227
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:21,352
AND THE METHANE WENT OFF
LIKE AN A-BOMB DOWN THERE.

228
00:10:22,654 --> 00:10:24,455
METHANE IN
A STORM SEWER?

229
00:10:24,522 --> 00:10:25,957
HOW DID THAT
GET DOWN THERE?

230
00:10:26,024 --> 00:10:29,060
MOOSE PANICKED.

231
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:32,931
ANYWAY, I'LL TELL YOU,
BY GOSH, THE SEWER REALLY
OPENED UP THERE.

232
00:10:32,997 --> 00:10:34,465
YOU CAN ACTUALLY STAND UP IN IT,

233
00:10:34,532 --> 00:10:37,035
AND THAT'S GOT TO BE A BIG
APPEAL FOR A LOT OF SHOPPERS.

234
00:10:37,101 --> 00:10:39,003
AND WE'VE GOT A
BRAND NEW SLOGAN.

235
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,373
WE'VE GOT ONE OF THE FEW
MALLS THAT'S RAT-FREE NOW TOO.

236
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,775
I CAN HELP OUT TOO.

237
00:10:43,841 --> 00:10:46,110
KNOW WHAT I CAN DO?
KNOW WHAT I CAN DO?
KNOW WHAT I CAN DO?

238
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:47,512
I CAN DO LIKE DISPLAYS

239
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:49,013
BECAUSE DISPLAYS DOWNTOWN,
THEY'VE GOT --

240
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,281
OUT OF IT, RIGHT?

241
00:10:50,348 --> 00:10:52,150
BUT I CAN MAKE UP THESE
MODERN COOL ONES, YOU KNOW,

242
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:53,518
BECAUSE I'LL BE
HONEST WITH YOU,

243
00:10:53,584 --> 00:10:55,753
LEISURE SUITS SOLD BY THE POUND
IS NOT A DRAWING CARD.

244
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,522
I'M JUST SAYING --

245
00:10:57,588 --> 00:10:59,757
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT MIGHT BE
GOOD TO HAVE A YOUNGER
PERSPECTIVE, HAROLD.

246
00:10:59,824 --> 00:11:01,826
YOU KNOW, OUR MARKET
RESEARCH HAS TOLD US

247
00:11:01,893 --> 00:11:04,429
THAT IT'S THE YOUNG PEOPLE
THAT HAVE THE DISPOSABLE INCOME.

248
00:11:04,495 --> 00:11:06,064
YOU DID MARKET RESEARCH?

249
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,599
WELL, SOMEBODY SAW
FLINTY McCLINTOCK'S
DAUGHTER WITH A 20.

250
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,301
I'M HOPIN' IT WASN'
YOUR 20, HAROLD.

251
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:14,005
I'M KIDDING.
I'M JUST KIDDING YOU.

252
00:11:14,072 --> 00:11:16,407
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
SENSITIVE ABOUT EVERYTHING.

253
00:11:17,175 --> 00:11:18,976
THIS MALL THING IS
A BIG OPPORTUNITY,

254
00:11:19,043 --> 00:11:20,611
WAVING RIGHT IN
FRONT OF YOUR FACE.

255
00:11:20,678 --> 00:11:23,581
YOU KNOW, THE BEST PART IS THE
UNDERGROUND PASSAGE PORTION

256
00:11:23,648 --> 00:11:28,186
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, WE CAN HAVE
ALL THESE SPECIAL ITEM DISPLAYS
THERE, YOU KNOW.

257
00:11:28,252 --> 00:11:30,555
CHEESE SAMPLES.
CHEESE.

258
00:11:31,756 --> 00:11:35,393
AND WE CAN INVITE SOAP OPERA
STARS TO COME UP AND SHAKE
HANDS WITH YOU.

259
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,729
(in deep voice)
I'M JAKE.

260
00:11:38,796 --> 00:11:40,264
I'VE GOT SO
MANY IDEAS, YOU KNOW?

261
00:11:40,331 --> 00:11:41,666
I COULD HELP OUT.

262
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:43,434
ALL RIGHT, WE CAN
USE THE INPUT.

263
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:44,735
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT REJECTION?

264
00:11:44,802 --> 00:11:46,938
I'M GETTING
USED TO IT.
OKAY.

265
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,244
THIS IS THE REPAIR PART
OF THE SHOW WE CALL,

266
00:11:53,311 --> 00:11:56,714
"IF IT AIN'T BROKE,
YOU'RE NOT TRYING."

267
00:11:56,781 --> 00:11:59,984
JOINING ME TODAY IS LOCAL
ROOFER ARNIE DOGAN.

268
00:12:00,051 --> 00:12:03,187
(APPLAUSE)

269
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:05,223
THANKS.
YEAH, YEAH.

270
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:07,458
IT'S GOOD
TO BE HERE.

271
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:10,628
YOU KNOW, MY REAL CAREER IS AS
A COUNTRY AND WESTERN SINGER.

272
00:12:10,695 --> 00:12:13,364
COUNTRY MUSIC IS
IN MY BLOOD.

273
00:12:13,431 --> 00:12:16,867
WHEREAS WITH ROOFING
IT'S JUST THE OPPOSITE.

274
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:19,470
YOU KNOW, RED, FALLING
OFF HIGH PLACES,

275
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:22,273
THAT'S AN INTEGRAL PART OF
YOUR ROOFING BUSINESS.
I SUPPOSE.

276
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,242
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE
WITH MY BROKEN ARM.

277
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:26,544
OH, MAN, YOU DON'T WANT
ME TO FIX YOUR ARM, DO YOU?

278
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:28,813
OH, NO, NO, THE DOCTOR
SET IT IN A CAST.

279
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,715
THEN I WENT UP ON
GEORGE DRINKWATER'S ROOF.

280
00:12:30,781 --> 00:12:32,583
HE'S GOT THE
HIGH-PITCHED ROOF.
YEAH.

281
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:35,753
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU'D HAVE
A HIGH-PITCHED VOICE BY NOW.

282
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,588
YEAH, I DIDN'T FALL
OFF ALL THE WAY.

283
00:12:37,655 --> 00:12:39,991
OH, I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH
TO CATCH THE CAST COMING
DOWN ON THE DRAIN BREATHER.

284
00:12:40,057 --> 00:12:41,859
I DID ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE
DOUGHNUTS BEFORE THE CAST BROKE.

285
00:12:41,926 --> 00:12:46,230
SO I WAS WONDERING, RED, MAYBE
YOU COULD REPAIR THAT FOR ME.

286
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,069
DOESN'T THAT HURT
A LITTLE BIT, ARNIE?

287
00:12:52,136 --> 00:12:55,673
SHE STINGS A
LITTLE BIT, RED.
YEAH. YEAH.

288
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,776
ESPECIALLY WHEN
I'M JOGGING.
OH, SURE.

289
00:12:58,843 --> 00:13:02,146
ON THE WAY OVER STINKY
PETERSON'S DOG GRABBED
AHOLD OF THE FINGERS,

290
00:13:02,213 --> 00:13:03,948
JUST WOULDN'T LET GO,

291
00:13:04,015 --> 00:13:06,984
'TIL I GOT A SORT OF WINDMILL
THING GOING, YOU KNOW?

292
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:08,386
COULDN'T GET HIM
OFF OF THERE.

293
00:13:08,452 --> 00:13:10,621
MAN, OH MAN.

294
00:13:10,688 --> 00:13:12,790
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO
BACK TO THE DOCTOR WITH THAT.

295
00:13:12,857 --> 00:13:14,291
OH, NO, OH, NO.

296
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:17,294
SEE, I STILL OWE HIM FOR THE
LEG SPLINTS AND BACK SURGERY.

297
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:20,464
MAYBE IF YOU COULD JUST JOIN UP
THE CAST I THINK I'LL BE FINE.

298
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:22,133
WELL, I DON'T REALLY
HAVE ANY PLASTER.

299
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:23,267
OH, GEEZ.

300
00:13:23,334 --> 00:13:25,402
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.

301
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:27,505
YEAH, I CAN --

302
00:13:27,571 --> 00:13:29,573
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S TRY THIS.

303
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,409
OH, OH,
OH, OH, OH!

304
00:13:32,476 --> 00:13:34,879
HOW ABOUT
BACK THIS WAY?

305
00:13:34,945 --> 00:13:38,782
IS THAT ALL RIGHT?
YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.

306
00:13:41,152 --> 00:13:43,521
ALL RIGHT, BOY, THIS IS A
LITTLE UNUSUAL, ARNIE.

307
00:13:43,587 --> 00:13:45,022
I APPRECIATE THIS, RED.

308
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:46,724
BOY, OH, BOY.

309
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,361
I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER
SEEN THIS PARTICULAR
TECHNIQUE BEFORE.

310
00:13:50,427 --> 00:13:51,595
THAT WILL FIX
'ER UP NICE.

311
00:13:51,662 --> 00:13:52,930
YOU THINK SO?

312
00:13:52,997 --> 00:13:55,599
YOU KNOW, THERE WILL
BE AN UPSIDE TO THIS;

313
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,903
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PLAY THE
GUITAR BEHIND YOUR BACK.

314
00:13:58,969 --> 00:14:01,272
RED, WHAT'S GOOD
ABOUT THAT?

315
00:14:01,338 --> 00:14:04,074
WON'T BE AS LOUD.

316
00:14:04,141 --> 00:14:05,709
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY,
YOU'RE DONE.

317
00:14:05,776 --> 00:14:07,111
ALL RIGHT, GEEZ.

318
00:14:07,177 --> 00:14:09,280
THANKS RED,
I OWE YOU ONE.

319
00:14:10,848 --> 00:14:12,716
YEAH, OKAY.

320
00:14:12,783 --> 00:14:14,618
TAKE IT EASY.

321
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:21,525
Red Green:
BILL, AND I ARE GOING
TO GO SKATING THIS WEEK.

322
00:14:21,592 --> 00:14:23,394
GET UP.
UP YOU GET.
UP YOU GET.

323
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,828
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL GET DOWN.

324
00:14:24,895 --> 00:14:26,297
THEN WE CAN BOTH GET UP.

325
00:14:26,363 --> 00:14:28,866
AND LAID OUT A LITTLE TRACK
OF PYLONS THERE.

326
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:31,068
WE'VE GOT A LITTLE RACE --
RACE AROUND THERE, YEAH.

327
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:32,236
HOW MANY LAPS WE GOING TO GO?

328
00:14:32,303 --> 00:14:34,338
WE DON'T KNOW YET.

329
00:14:34,405 --> 00:14:36,073
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE.

330
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,609
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING ABOUT
A FROZEN POND TO ME,

331
00:14:38,676 --> 00:14:42,513
JUST SUMS UP WINTER IN
OUR PART OF THE COUNTRY
AND IT'S JUST --

332
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:44,181
YOU KNOW, I KNOW THEY HAVE
THE ARENAS AND WHAT-HAVE-YOU,

333
00:14:44,248 --> 00:14:46,684
BUT TO ME THERE'S
NO COMPARISON.

334
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,521
IT'S JUST THE KIND OF SKATING
YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE ON A POND

335
00:14:50,587 --> 00:14:53,991
AND, YOU KNOW, TO BE WITH A
FRIEND AND JUST KIND OF
ENJOYING THE DAY

336
00:14:54,058 --> 00:14:56,994
AND GETTING THE FRESH AIR
THERE IN YOUR FACE.

337
00:14:57,061 --> 00:14:59,129
AND, MY GOSH, YOU CAN
HAVE A LOT OF FUN,

338
00:14:59,196 --> 00:15:02,332
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE WITH THAT
ONE SPECIAL PERSON THAT YOU
CAN DO THINGS TO,

339
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,867
LIKE THAT.

340
00:15:03,934 --> 00:15:05,702
IT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE.

341
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:07,404
AND, YOU KNOW,
A LITTLE COMPETITION
DOESN'T HURT EITHER.

342
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:09,440
NOW, WE'VE TRIED --
THE RACE DIDN'T GO SO WELL,

343
00:15:09,506 --> 00:15:10,908
SO NOW WE'RE GOING
TO COMPETE AT STOPPING.

344
00:15:10,974 --> 00:15:13,177
THE IDEA, BILL WANTS
ME TO SHOOT UP THERE.

345
00:15:13,243 --> 00:15:14,912
LOOK, IT'S
ROCKET RICHARD THERE.

346
00:15:14,978 --> 00:15:16,814
STOP ON A DIME.
THERE YOU GO.
THERE YOU GO.

347
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,082
I CAN BACK UP EVEN.

348
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:20,651
AND BILL'S GOING TO COME --

349
00:15:20,717 --> 00:15:23,053
BILL, BILL, A LITTLE
MORE ACCELERATION.

350
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,355
OH-OH!

351
00:15:25,422 --> 00:15:27,758
ALL RIGHT, WELL, HE DID
EVENTUALLY STOP,

352
00:15:27,825 --> 00:15:29,493
BUT THAT WAS THE TREE.

353
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,828
NOW WHAT ARE
YOU DOING NOW, BILL?

354
00:15:30,894 --> 00:15:31,795
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

355
00:15:31,862 --> 00:15:33,764
YOU'VE GOT THE ROPE.

356
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:35,098
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

357
00:15:35,165 --> 00:15:40,304
OH, NOW THIS IS
EXCITING, ISN'T IT?

358
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,506
BILLS'S TRYING AN OLD TRICK.

359
00:15:42,573 --> 00:15:44,308
IT'S CALLED CRACK THE WHIP.

360
00:15:44,374 --> 00:15:49,379
AND GET THE OTHER GUY GOING,
AND YOU WHIP HIM AROUND
AND CRACK THE WHIP.

361
00:15:49,446 --> 00:15:51,348
THIS IS ME CRACKING
THE WHIP, RIGHT.

362
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:52,683
HERE'S HOW YOU DO IT.
HERE'S HOW YOU DO IT.

363
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:55,118
YOU'VE GOT TO GET
SOME JUICE GOING.

364
00:15:55,185 --> 00:15:56,653
CRACK THAT BABY.

365
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,489
GET HIM ON THE ICE THERE AND
WHIP HIM AROUND AND LET HIM GO.

366
00:15:59,556 --> 00:16:03,427
OH, BOY.
OH, BOY.
OH, BOY.

367
00:16:03,493 --> 00:16:04,828
HANG ON, BILL.

368
00:16:04,895 --> 00:16:05,696
HANG ON.
HANG ON.
HANG ON.

369
00:16:05,762 --> 00:16:06,964
I'LL HELP YOU.
I'LL HELP YOU.

370
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,165
THERE YOU GO.
THERE YOU GO.

371
00:16:08,231 --> 00:16:12,202
OH, THERE,
I GOT YOU DOWN.

372
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:14,605
YOU'RE FINE.

373
00:16:14,671 --> 00:16:17,307
WANT TO GO SKATING AGAIN, BILL?
YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO --

374
00:16:17,374 --> 00:16:24,081
OH, BILL, ACTUALLY MAYBE YOU'RE
GOING TO NEED YOUR SKATES
I THINK TO...

375
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:26,883
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

376
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:31,188
OH, BOY.

377
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:37,527
WELL, WE'RE ALL SET FOR
OUR BIG MALL OPENING HERE.

378
00:16:37,594 --> 00:16:38,795
IT'S AWESOME.
IT'S AWESOME.

379
00:16:38,862 --> 00:16:40,430
IT IS SO COOL.
IT'S SO INCREDIBLY AWESOME.

380
00:16:40,497 --> 00:16:42,866
THE SEWER WALLS ALL HAVE
TEEN POSTERS ON THEM,

381
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:44,267
AND THERE'S
BLACK LIGHTS.

382
00:16:44,334 --> 00:16:47,104
THERE'S EVEN
A VIDEO GAME.

383
00:16:47,704 --> 00:16:49,439
OKAY, IT'S PONG,
BUT STILL...

384
00:16:49,506 --> 00:16:51,375
YEAH, YEAH.

385
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:53,410
I WAS THINKING YOU GUYS SHOULD
HAVE PICKED A BETTER ANCHOR
STORE FOR THE MALL

386
00:16:53,477 --> 00:16:56,079
BECAUSE USUALLY IT'S A
MAJOR-NAME DEPARTMENT STORE
OF SOME SORT,

387
00:16:56,146 --> 00:16:58,248
NOT JUST THE GASKET SHOP.

388
00:16:58,315 --> 00:17:02,219
HAROLD, IT'S NOT JUST
A GASKET SHOP,

389
00:17:02,285 --> 00:17:04,454
IT'S CUSTOM GASKETS.

390
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:06,156
O-O-O-H!

391
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:07,724
WHILE YOU WAIT, FOLKS,

392
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,292
YOU GO IN THERE,
YOU TAKE YOUR FLANGE,

393
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,727
YOUR HOUSING, WHATEVER,

394
00:17:10,794 --> 00:17:12,829
THEN BINGO, BANGO, BONGO
THERE'S YOUR GASKET.

395
00:17:12,896 --> 00:17:15,866
YOU'RE OUT, AND YOU'RE ON YOUR
WAY TO THE ICE CREAM STORE.

396
00:17:15,932 --> 00:17:19,169
WELL, I NEVER THOUGHT
OF IT THAT WAY.

397
00:17:19,236 --> 00:17:22,072
WHAT I WAS THINKING THOUGH,
I THINK YOU SHOULD CHANGE
IT TO A YOGURT SHOP

398
00:17:22,139 --> 00:17:23,907
BECAUSE YOGURT'S
GOOD FOR YOU.

399
00:17:23,974 --> 00:17:25,709
WELL, I DON'T LIKE THINGS
THAT ARE GOOD FOR ME.

400
00:17:25,775 --> 00:17:26,910
WELL, I DO.
I LOVE THINGS THAT
ARE GOOD FOR ME.

401
00:17:26,977 --> 00:17:28,111
I ONLY DO GOOD THINGS
THAT ARE GOOD FOR ME.

402
00:17:28,178 --> 00:17:29,146
I ALWAYS DO THINGS
THAT ARE GOOD FOR ME.

403
00:17:29,212 --> 00:17:31,548
THEN STOP TALKING.
OKAY.

404
00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:35,585
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT
PORTION OF THE SHOW,

405
00:17:35,652 --> 00:17:38,822
WHERE WE EXPLORE THOSE THREE
LITTLE WORDS THAT MEN FIND
SO HARD TO SAY...

406
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:41,691
Audience:
I DON'T KNOW.

407
00:17:41,758 --> 00:17:42,926
THEY DON'T EITHER.

408
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:45,462
THEY TALK AND
THEY DON'T KNOW NOTHING.

409
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:48,398
JOINING MY UNCLE RED
IS Mr. BUZZ SHERWOOD,

410
00:17:48,465 --> 00:17:49,833
AND HE'S OUR LOCAL BUSH PILOT.

411
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,501
AND BUZZ, YOU'VE
BEEN FLYING SINCE --

412
00:17:51,568 --> 00:17:55,538
UH, SINCE MY VERY FIRST
IRON BUTTERFLY CONCERT.

413
00:17:57,841 --> 00:17:59,743
TODAY'S LETTER
GOES AS FOLLOWS.

414
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:01,678
IT SAYS...
"DEAR EXPERTS --"

415
00:18:01,745 --> 00:18:03,413
LA-LA-LA.

416
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,814
LAST YEAR --

417
00:18:04,881 --> 00:18:06,283
OH, THIS IS FROM
REDDING, PENNSYLVANIA.

418
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:08,184
THAT'S FAR AWAY.

419
00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:09,753
GOTTO KEEP THE STAMP.

420
00:18:09,819 --> 00:18:13,923
"DEAR EXPERTS: LAST YEAR OUR
SON TURNED 15 AND BEGAN
TO REALLY CHANGE,

421
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,325
"LOSING INTEREST IN SCHOOL,

422
00:18:15,392 --> 00:18:16,593
"IGNORING HIS APPEARANCE,

423
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,861
"AVOIDING HIS FAMILY,

424
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:20,563
"ACTING WEIRDLY AND GENERALLY
TURNING INTO A ROTTEN KID.

425
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,499
"WHAT DID WE DO WRONG?"

426
00:18:22,565 --> 00:18:24,868
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU,
IF I HAD A 15-YEAR-OLD KID,

427
00:18:24,934 --> 00:18:27,237
I'D GET HIM A CAR WITH
A FULL TANK OF GAS,

428
00:18:27,303 --> 00:18:29,005
POINT HIM TOWARD THE TOWN
WHERE NOBODY KNOWS ME,

429
00:18:29,072 --> 00:18:32,108
AND WHATEVER HAPPENS HAPPENS.

430
00:18:32,175 --> 00:18:34,344
UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE TO
BE 16 TO DRIVE A CAR.

431
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:36,846
WHATEVER HAPPENS HAPPENS.

432
00:18:36,913 --> 00:18:38,214
NO WAY, RED!

433
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:39,582
YOU CAN'T PUT KIDS DOWN.

434
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:42,285
US KIDS, WE'RE THE HOPE
OF THE FUTURE GENERATION.

435
00:18:42,352 --> 00:18:43,219
WE?

436
00:18:43,286 --> 00:18:44,888
YOU'RE STILL A KID,
BUZZ, ARE YOU?

437
00:18:44,954 --> 00:18:46,456
WELL, YEAH, BASICALLY,

438
00:18:46,523 --> 00:18:49,859
BECAUSE I'M
ONLY 25-9

439
00:18:49,926 --> 00:18:52,629
35, 39, 44 --

440
00:18:52,695 --> 00:18:55,098
OH, MAN, I'M 46!

441
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:58,201
MAN, WHAT HAPPENED?

442
00:18:58,268 --> 00:19:01,538
I THINK YOU SMOKED
THE CALENDAR.

443
00:19:01,604 --> 00:19:04,974
I MEAN, THESE PARENTS THEY OUGHT
TO JUST BACK OFF ON THE KID
A LITTLE AND CHILL,

444
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,843
YOU KNOW, LIKE LET HIM
GO THROUGH THIS PHASE.

445
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,077
HE'S JUST REBELLING A LITTLE.

446
00:19:08,144 --> 00:19:09,279
HE'LL GROW OUT OF IT.

447
00:19:09,345 --> 00:19:10,613
TWHEN?

448
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,581
I DON'T KNOW.

449
00:19:11,648 --> 00:19:15,351
WHEN HE'S 29, 34, 40 --

450
00:19:15,418 --> 00:19:16,286
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

451
00:19:16,352 --> 00:19:17,153
47.

452
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,454
YOU'RE 56.
I'M 52.

453
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:20,256
GOT YOU!

454
00:19:20,323 --> 00:19:22,158
(LAUGHTER)

455
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:34,437
I JUST HAVE THE
ONE QUESTION REALLY.

456
00:19:34,504 --> 00:19:37,840
WHY ARE FIREWORKS LEGAL?

457
00:19:37,907 --> 00:19:41,811
AND WHAT KIND Of MIND WOULD
USE THEM AT A MALL OPENING,

458
00:19:41,878 --> 00:19:45,615
AN INDOOR MALL OPENING?

459
00:19:45,682 --> 00:19:48,518
I WAS IN MURRAY'S STORE
WHEN THEY WENT OFF.

460
00:19:48,585 --> 00:19:51,254
BALL ROCKETS
GOING EVERYWHERE.

461
00:19:51,321 --> 00:19:55,425
A COUPLE OF CANNON-CRACKERS
RIPPED THROUGH THE
GET-WELL CARDS.

462
00:19:55,491 --> 00:19:59,228
I SAW TWO PINWHEELS GOING
ON A LINGERIE MANNEQUIN.

463
00:19:59,295 --> 00:20:04,334
(LAUGHTER)

464
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,338
ACTUALLY THAT BROUGHT
BACK A FEW MEMORIES.

465
00:20:08,404 --> 00:20:10,173
BUT THERE WAS
NO REAL DANGER

466
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:13,309
BECAUSE THEY GOT THE SPRINKLER
SYSTEM THERE AND THAT WENT OFF.

467
00:20:13,376 --> 00:20:16,779
BY GOSH, THOSE UNITS CAN
REALLY PUMP OUT THE WATER,
JUST EVERYTHING.

468
00:20:16,846 --> 00:20:18,715
UNFORTUNATELY THE
WATER WENT ALL DOWN

469
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:21,551
AND COMPLETELY FLOODED OUT
THE ENTIRE STORM SEWER,

470
00:20:21,617 --> 00:20:24,687
AND I THINK THERE WERE
SOME SHOPPERS DOWN THERE.

471
00:20:24,754 --> 00:20:26,656
(HAROLD'S SHOES SLOSHING)

472
00:20:26,723 --> 00:20:29,092
OH, OH, OH.

473
00:20:29,158 --> 00:20:31,861
WERE ALL THE
STORES FLOODED?

474
00:20:35,231 --> 00:20:39,469
OH, YEAH.
OH, YEAH!

475
00:20:39,535 --> 00:20:40,770
BOOKSTORE,

476
00:20:40,837 --> 00:20:44,373
BAKERY,

477
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,309
TOY STORE.

478
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,077
OH, HAROLD.

479
00:20:48,144 --> 00:20:50,947
OH, YEAH
WHAT? WHAT? WHAT?

480
00:20:51,013 --> 00:20:54,851
EVEN THE BIG LADIES' UNDERWEAR
STORE GOT FLOODED OUT.

481
00:20:56,452 --> 00:21:00,523
EITHER THAT OR BUSTER'S WIFE
IS GOING TO CATCH HER
DEATH OF COLD.

482
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,025
YOU SHOULDN'T BE
MAKING JOKES.

483
00:21:03,092 --> 00:21:04,393
DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH!

484
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,628
DON'T.
YOU SHOULDN'T.

485
00:21:05,695 --> 00:21:06,829
I HOPE YOU LEARNED
SOMETHING TODAY.

486
00:21:06,896 --> 00:21:08,231
I DID, HAROLD.

487
00:21:08,297 --> 00:21:09,765
I LEARNED THAT NO MATTER
HOW MUCH PLANNING YOU DO,

488
00:21:09,832 --> 00:21:12,301
THERE'S ALWAYS ONE IDIOT
WHO'LL MESS THINGS UP.

489
00:21:12,368 --> 00:21:15,838
I ACCEPT THAT
AS AN APOLOGY.

490
00:21:15,905 --> 00:21:17,440
I HOPE YOU LEARNED
SOMETHING TOO, HAROLD.

491
00:21:17,507 --> 00:21:18,841
YES, I DID ACTUALLY.

492
00:21:18,908 --> 00:21:20,109
OH, I LEARNED
SO MANY THINGS...

493
00:21:20,176 --> 00:21:21,344
OH, YES, YES, YES, YES.

494
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,945
FIRST THING I LEARNED
THAT I CAN SWIM,

495
00:21:23,012 --> 00:21:24,981
WHICH IS A VERY GOOD THING TO
KNOW AT TIMES LIKE THAT.

496
00:21:25,047 --> 00:21:26,182
OH, YES.
OH, YES.

497
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:28,017
AND I LEARNED WHILE
SWIMMING IN A SEWER,

498
00:21:28,084 --> 00:21:29,752
I CAN HOLD MY BREATH
FOR TEN MINUTES.

499
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:31,220
WELL, THAT'S VERY,
VERY GOOD.

500
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:32,622
OH, IT'S VERY GOOD.

501
00:21:32,688 --> 00:21:35,691
UNFORTUNATELY I WAS
IN THERE FOR AN HOUR!

502
00:21:35,758 --> 00:21:37,426
(POSSUM CALL)

503
00:21:37,493 --> 00:21:39,028
IT'S MEETING TIME,
UNCLE RED. YEAH.

504
00:21:39,095 --> 00:21:40,363
IS IT SAFE TO
GO DOWNSTAIRS?

505
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:41,864
YOU'LL BE FINE.
AWAY YOU GO.

506
00:21:41,931 --> 00:21:43,499
I'LL BE DOWN
IN A MINUTE.

507
00:21:43,566 --> 00:21:45,668
ALL RIGHT.

508
00:21:45,735 --> 00:21:47,637
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

509
00:21:47,703 --> 00:21:49,238
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT
HOME AFTER THE MEETING.

510
00:21:49,305 --> 00:21:53,442
I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE FOR
THE MALL OPENING AND CLOSING.

511
00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:56,212
BUT I THINK THAT'S THE END
OF FIREWORKS FOR ONE DAY,

512
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:58,114
UNLESS YOU'RE AWAKE
WHEN I COME HOME.

513
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,182
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

514
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:03,953
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND HAROLD
AND THE WHOLE GANG UP HERE
AT POSSUM LODGE,

515
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,888
YOU KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

516
00:22:05,955 --> 00:22:09,125
(APPLAUSE)

517
00:22:09,191 --> 00:22:17,133
[CAPTIONS PERFORMED BY
CAPTION RESOURCE CENTER]

518
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:19,001
Harold:
OH, HERE HE IS.
TAKE YOUR SEATS.

519
00:22:19,068 --> 00:22:23,873
TAKE YOUR SEATS PLEASE.
TAKE YOUR SEATS.

520
00:22:23,939 --> 00:22:25,841
ALL RISE.

521
00:22:28,344 --> 00:22:31,180
Everyone:
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI.

522
00:22:31,247 --> 00:22:33,015
Red Green:
SIT DOWN.

523
00:22:33,082 --> 00:22:34,717
Harold:
OKAY, I JUST HAVE
THE ONE ANNOUNCEMENT.

524
00:22:34,784 --> 00:22:37,219
IT'S FROM BAKER'S FUNERAL HOME.

525
00:22:37,286 --> 00:22:40,222
DURING THE FUNERAL PROCESSION
FOR MOOSE THOMPSON'S GRANDFATHER
THE OTHER DAY,

526
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:42,224
THEY BURNED OUT THE
CLUTCH ON THE HEARSE.

527
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,860
SO FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS ONLY,

528
00:22:44,927 --> 00:22:48,063
Mr. BAKER IS FORCED TO USE
HIS SON'S STRATOCHIEF WAGON
AS A HEARSE.

529
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,498
YOU ALL KNOW THAT ONE.

530
00:22:49,565 --> 00:22:51,333
IT'S THE BRIGHT YELLOW ONE WITH
THE FLAMES ACROSS THE HOOD.

531
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,068
IT SAYS "SATAN'S CHOICE"
ON THE TAILGATE.

532
00:22:53,135 --> 00:22:56,038
HE SAYS IF YOU LIKE IT,
WE CAN KEEP USING IT.

533
00:22:56,105 --> 00:22:58,707
SEEMS NO ONE'S
COMPLAINING SO FAR.
