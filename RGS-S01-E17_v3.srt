00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,892
DO.

143
00:04:55,694 --> 00:04:59,665
THAT SMELLS GOOD.

144
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:02,801
OKAY, JUST FINISH THAT UP THERE

145
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:05,904
AND JUST DRY HER OFF.

146
00:05:05,904 --> 00:05:09,975

WELL, THAT'S--IT'S NOT PERFECT,

156
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,250
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY GOOD ENOUGH

157
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,651
FOR OUR PURPOSES.

158
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:54,420

00:06:21,613 --> 00:06:26,251
ITS SIDE, BUT HERE WORKS GOOD.

173
00:06:26,251 --> 00:06:27,686
TRY TO SEE WHAT YOU'VE DONE SO

174
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:30,022
THAT YOU DON'T MISS ANY SPOTS.

175
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,089
THIS COLOR'S GOOD FOR THAT,

176
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:33,058
ISN'T IT?

177
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:35,294
ALL RIGHT.

178
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:38,263
YOU GOT HER PRIMED THERE.

179
00:06:38,263 --> 00:06:40,566
NOW YOU JUST WAIT FOR IT TO DRY,

180
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,534
AND THEN PUT ON THE FINISH COAT.

181
00:06:51,643 --> 00:06:52,544
OKAY, I PRETTY WELL EMPTIED THE

182
00:06:52,544 --> 00:06:54,780
WHOLE CAN INTO THERE.

183
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,014
THOSE DRIPS'LL WEAR OFF.

184
00:06:56,014 --> 00:06:57,783
AND I THINK THIS IS--IT'LL FADE,

185
00:06:57,783 --> 00:06:59,117
AND IT'LL BLEND IN.

186
00:06:59,117 --> 00:07:00,519
AND ANYWAY, THERE YOU GOT IT.

187
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,320
YOU'VE DONE IT ALL YOURSELF.

188
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,120
A HECK OF A JOB.

189
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,956
SO UNTIL NEXT TIME, REMEMBER.

190
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,357
IF THE WOMEN DON'T FIND YOU

191
00:07:05,357 --> 00:07:06,658
HANDSOME, THEY SHOULD AT LEAST

192
00:07:06,658 --> 00:07:08,627
FIND YOU HANDY.

193
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:17,803
HAROLD! HAROLD! HAROLD! HAROLD!

194
00:07:17,803 --> 00:07:18,704

BONUS!

201
00:07:28,013 --> 00:07:29,981
[laughs]

202
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,395
>> IT IS SPRING.

203
00:07:43,395 --> 00:07:45,330
TADPOLES SWIM IN A STAGNANT POND

204
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,299
SURROUNDED BY FLOATING LILIES

205
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:48,967
AND WATER SNAKES.

206
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:50,035
YOU'RE TEMPTED TO DESTROY THEIR

207
00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:51,736
WORLD WITH MEN AND EQUIPMENT,

208
00:07:51,736 --> 00:07:53,338
TO DRY UP THE SWAMP

209
00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:55,273
AND KILL THE ANIMALS.

210
00:07:55,273 --> 00:07:55,941
BUT WHAT THE HELL?

211
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:56,608
YOU DON'T GO DOWN TO THE

212
00:07:56,608 --> 00:07:58,577
BASEMENT THAT OFTEN ANYWAY.

213
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:03,715
WELL, AS I WAS SAYING BEFORE I

214
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:05,684
WAS SO RUDELY SPECIAL EFFECTED,

215
00:08:05,684 --> 00:08:07,552
MOOSE THOMPSON DECIDED TO MAKE

216
00:08:07,552 --> 00:08:09,087
THE SHOTGUN SHELL SALT AND

217
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:10,722
PEPPER SHAKERS WHEN HE COME HOME

218
00:08:10,722 --> 00:08:11,990
FROM THE DUCK HUNT WITH A WHOLE

219
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,292
BOATLOAD OF EMPTY SHOTGUN SHELLS

220
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:15,827
AND NO DUCK.

221
00:08:15,827 --> 00:08:17,195
BUT ANYWAY, WE ALL KIND OF LIKED

222
00:08:17,195 --> 00:08:19,097
THE IDEA 'CAUSE SHOTGUN SHELLS

223
00:08:19,097 --> 00:08:20,932
KIND OF GO WELL WITH THE DECOR

224
00:08:20,932 --> 00:08:22,200
HERE AT THE LODGE, WHICH IS MORE

225
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,336
OR LESS A WOODSMAN'S MOTIF UNDER

226
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:26,805
A LAYER OF GRIME AND FUZZ.

227
00:08:26,805 --> 00:08:28,406
OR AS WE CALL HIM, OLD MAN

228
00:08:28,406 --> 00:08:29,374
SEDGEWICK.

229
00:08:29,374 --> 00:08:30,342
>> OH, THAT'S A REALLY

230
00:08:30,342 --> 00:08:31,276
INTERESTING STORY, UNCLE RED,

231
00:08:31,276 --> 00:08:32,344
BUT I THINK, YOU KNOW, THE

232
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:33,311
CERTAIN CROSS SECTION OF OUR

233
00:08:33,311 --> 00:08:35,113
AUDIENCE MIGHT FIND IT, LIKE,

234
00:08:35,113 --> 00:08:36,281
BORING.

235
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:37,449
WELL, YOU KNOW.

236
00:08:37,449 --> 00:08:38,450
YOU KNOW, LIKE CROSS SECTIONS

237
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,751
CAN BE--YOU KNOW.

238
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:40,885
AND WELL, IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST

239
00:08:40,885 --> 00:08:41,686
THINGS I LEARNED AT TV

240
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:43,755
PRODUCTION SCHOOL, IS THAT TV IS

241
00:08:43,755 --> 00:08:45,123
ABOUT SHOWING, NOT TALKING,

242
00:08:45,123 --> 00:08:45,790
RIGHT?

243
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,791
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TV

244
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,226
AND RADIO.

245
00:08:48,226 --> 00:08:51,096
WELL, THAT AND THE PAY.

246
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:52,163
>> WELL, MAYBE I SHOULD BRING A

247
00:08:52,163 --> 00:08:53,164
COUPLE OF SHOTGUN SHELLS OUT

248
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:53,832
HERE.

249
00:08:53,832 --> 00:08:54,799
WE'D HAVE TO KEEP THEM AWAY FROM

250
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,767
THE HOT LIGHTS THOUGH.

251
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:56,568
>> WELL, YEAH.

252
00:08:56,568 --> 00:08:57,669
YEAH, WE COULD DO THAT.

253
00:08:57,669 --> 00:08:58,503
OR I WAS THINKING INSTEAD WE

254
00:08:58,503 --> 00:08:59,804
COULD JUST, LIKE, YOU KNOW, MOVE

255
00:08:59,804 --> 00:09:00,905
RIGHT ON TO SOMETHING ELSE, AND

256
00:09:00,905 --> 00:09:02,741
THAT'D BE BEST FOR ALL PARTIES.

257
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:04,309
>> WHAT ABOUT MY STORY?

258
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:06,978
>> WHAT STORY IS THAT?

259
00:09:06,978 --> 00:09:08,113
>> I FORGET.

260
00:09:08,113 --> 00:09:09,214
>> OH.

261
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:10,048
WELL, WHILE YOU'RE TRYING TO

262
00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:10,882
REMEMBER, WHY DON'T YOU DO ONE

263
00:09:10,882 --> 00:09:12,217
OF THOSE NEAT SEGUE THINGS YOU

264
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:13,785
DO.

265
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:14,886
>> ALL RIGHT.

266
00:09:14,886 --> 00:09:16,855
HERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

267
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:20,625
OH, I REMEMBER NOW.

268
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:21,793
IT WAS THE SALT AND PEPPER

269
00:09:21,793 --> 00:09:22,961
SHOTGUN SHELL THING.

270
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:23,995
>> OH, YEAH.

271
00:09:23,995 --> 00:09:24,729
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

272
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:26,698
OH, BOY.

273
00:09:30,435 --> 00:09:32,203
>> I'M OUT HERE WITH ONE OF THE

274

00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:42,580

281
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,481
YOU KNOW, SHE DOES KIND OF CATCH

282
00:09:43,481 --> 00:09:44,916
YOUR ATTENTION, DON'T SHE?

283
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,151
>> I'LL SAY.

284
00:09:46,151 --> 00:09:48,620

285
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,754
[laughs]

286
00:09:49,754 --> 00:09:50,955
NOW, I'M NOT SAYIN' THAT I GOT

287
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:54,225

295
00:10:04,536 --> 00:10:06,171
THIS IS LIKE A MAGNET TO WOMEN.

296
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:06,838

297
00:10:06,838 --> 00:10:07,672
>> AND THEY COULD BE, YOU KNOW,

298

THEY'D BE RIGHT UP THERE, JUST

302
00:10:12,477 --> 00:10:14,679
LIKE A MAGNET AND A BIT OF STEEL

303

00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:09,067
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE TO HAVE

340
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:10,468
STRANGERS GETTIN' TOO CLOSE TO

341
00:11:10,468 --> 00:11:12,804
MY INSTRUMENT CLUSTER, YOU KNOW?

342
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:14,439
MIND YOU, IF IT'S SOMEBODY I

343
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:16,407
KNOW, AND I APPROVE OF 'EM, MY

344
00:11:16,407 --> 00:11:17,275
TYPE OF WOMAN, I DON'T MIND HER

345
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:18,376
SITTIN' UP THERE.

346
00:11:18,376 --> 00:11:19,477
>> OH, YEAH?

347
00:11:19,477 --> 00:11:20,845
WHAT IS--WHAT IS YOUR TYPE OF

348
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:21,679
WOMAN, DOUG?

349
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,514
>> WELL, RED, I'LL TELL YOU.

350
00:11:23,514 --> 00:11:26,350
SHE'S GOTTA BE BETWEEN THE AGES

351
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,320
OF 15 AND 55.

352
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,488
I HAVE A FEW DEMANDS, BUT ONE OF

353
00:11:30,488 --> 00:11:31,689
'EM IS THAT SHE HAVE HER OWN

354
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:34,092
HAIR, AND, UH, IT DOESN'T MATTER

355
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:35,359
TO ME IF, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOME

356
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:37,929
BODY PARTS COURTESY OF MODERN

357
00:11:37,929 --> 00:11:38,996
SCIENCE THERE.

358
00:11:38,996 --> 00:11:41,399
I MEAN THAT'S QUITE ACCEPTABLE,

359
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,567
BUT, YOU KNOW, THEY JUST LOVE

360
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:44,702
TO--THEY LOVE TO GET UP HERE IN

361
00:11:44,702 --> 00:11:47,104
THE CAB ON--ON A NICE HOT DAY

362
00:11:47,104 --> 00:11:48,873
AND FEEL MY FUN FUR SEAT COVERS.

363
00:11:48,873 --> 00:11:49,874
THEY'RE OUT AT THE CLEANERS

364
00:11:49,874 --> 00:11:51,008
RIGHT NOW, ACTUALLY, BUT THEY

365
00:11:51,008 --> 00:11:53,110
JUST LOVE THAT.

366
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,078
>> YEAH, YOU KNOW, DOUG, IT

367
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:57,281
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THIS TRUCK HAS

368
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:58,049
CHANGED YOUR WHOLE SEX LIFE,

369
00:11:58,049 --> 00:11:58,716
HUH?

370
00:11:58,716 --> 00:12:00,484
>> [laughs]

371
00:12:00,484 --> 00:12:01,552
OH, RED.

372
00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:02,587
YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD

373
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:04,322
THERE, I'LL TELL YOU, MY FRIEND.

374
00:12:04,322 --> 00:12:05,122
[laughs]

375
00:12:05,122 --> 00:12:07,091
[coughing]

376
00:12:07,091 --> 00:12:08,192
>> WELL, THAT IS GREAT.

377
00:12:08,192 --> 00:12:10,695
DOUGIE FRANKLIN, LADIES' MAN.

378
00:12:10,695 --> 00:12:11,629
>> [gagging]

379
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:13,431
>> WAY TO GO, DOUGIE.

380
00:12:13,431 --> 00:12:15,800
>> OH, THAT'S THE LAST TIME I'M

381
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,768
TOUCHIN' THAT TUNA SALAD.

382
00:12:20,871 --> 00:12:22,006
>> [strumming guitar] I'M NOT A MALCONTENT

383
00:12:22,006 --> 00:12:24,508
IN ANY WAY

384
00:12:24,508 --> 00:12:25,910
I DON'T BELIEVE IN DREAMING

385
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,012
YOUR WHOLE LIFE AWAY

386
00:12:28,012 --> 00:12:30,014
BUT IF I HAD ONE WISH

387
00:12:30,014 --> 00:12:31,983
FOR THE GOOD LORD TO GRANT

388
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:34,485
I'D WISH TO TAKE A WET TOWEL

389
00:12:34,485 --> 00:12:35,586
TO A NUDIST CAMP

390
00:12:35,586 --> 00:12:36,854
>> [laughs]

391
00:12:36,854 --> 00:12:38,422
>> SMACK, SMACK, SMACK

392
00:12:38,422 --> 00:12:39,123
OH, SORRY

393
00:12:39,123 --> 00:12:40,925
DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE

394
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:42,560
DRIP, DRIP, DRIP

395
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,461
THEY DON'T CALL IT ICE WATER

396
00:12:43,461 --> 00:12:44,495
FOR NOTHIN'

397
00:12:44,495 --> 00:12:46,597
SLAP, FOOF, AH!

398
00:12:46,597 --> 00:12:47,798
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEND

399
00:12:47,798 --> 00:12:50,267
MONEY TO HAVE FUN

400
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:51,102
THAT'S THE TRUTH, ISN'T IT,

401
00:12:51,102 --> 00:12:51,769
HAROLD?

402
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:52,436
>> [laughs]

403
00:12:52,436 --> 00:12:53,237
YOU SAID "NUDIST."

404
00:12:53,237 --> 00:12:55,206
[laughs]

405
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:58,476
OH, UNCLE RED, EXCELLENT.

406
00:12:58,476 --> 00:12:59,243
THIS IS GREAT.

407
00:12:59,243 --> 00:13:00,544
IT'S ANSWER THE LETTER TIME.

408
00:13:00,544 --> 00:13:01,379
THIS IS MY FAVORITE PART OF THE

409
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:02,213
SHOW, YOU KNOW.

410
00:13:02,213 --> 00:13:03,314
I LOVE THIS PART 'CAUSE IT'S--

411
00:13:03,314 --> 00:13:05,015
IT'S AN EXCHANGING OF IDEAS.

412
00:13:05,015 --> 00:13:05,850
I LOVE THAT ASPECT TO IT, YOU

413
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:06,517
KNOW?

414
00:13:06,517 --> 00:13:07,752
IT'S EXHILARATING TO ME.

415
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:08,586
I THINK IT'S JUST THE BEST PART

416
00:13:08,586 --> 00:13:09,587
OF THE WHOLE PROGRAM.

417
00:13:09,587 --> 00:13:10,488
[laughs]

418
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:11,489
>> JUST READ THE LETTER, HAROLD.

419
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:12,289
>> OH, OKAY.

420
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:13,524
JUST--I'M JUST SO EXCITED.

421
00:13:13,524 --> 00:13:14,725
THIS IS SUCH A GREAT LETTER.

422
00:13:14,725 --> 00:13:16,494
"DEAR RED, I'VE SEEN YOUR SHOW A

423
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:18,062
FEW TIMES NOW, AND I FORCE MY

424
00:13:18,062 --> 00:13:19,029
CHILDREN TO WATCH IT UNLESS

425
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:20,865
THEY'VE BEEN GOOD.

426
00:13:20,865 --> 00:13:22,366
I ENJOY THE PROGRAM, BUT IT--I

427
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:23,300
THINK IT WOULD BE A LOT BETTER

428
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,268
IF IT WAS MORE LIKE THE OLD

429
00:13:24,268 --> 00:13:27,705
DICK VAN DYKE SHOW."

430
00:13:27,705 --> 00:13:29,039
>> WELL, ALL RIGHT, HAROLD, YOU

431
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,040
KNOW HOW HAPPY WE ARE TO GET A

432
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,243
LETTER OF THIS TYPE, ESPECIALLY

433
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:33,110
WHEN IT CONTAINS A TERRIFIC

434
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,679
SUGGESTION LIKE THAT.

435
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:37,615
YOU KNOW, THE DICK VAN DYKE

436
00:13:37,615 --> 00:13:38,983
REFERENCE IS INTERESTING, AND WE

437
00:13:38,983 --> 00:13:41,152
WEREN'T REALLY TRYING TO DO

438
00:13:41,152 --> 00:13:43,220
EXACTLY THAT KIND OF A SHOW.

439
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,522
WE WERE THINKING MORE ALONG THE

440
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:47,791
LINES OF BEWITCHED OR MR. ED.

441
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,293
>> OH, WELL, UNCLE RED, I DON'T

442
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:50,728
THINK SARCASM'S IN ORDER.

443
00:13:50,728 --> 00:13:51,662
NOTHING CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH

444
00:13:51,662 --> 00:13:52,530
THAT.

445
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,364
THE VIEWER JUST HAD A

446
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:54,131
SUGGESTION.

447
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:54,832
I THINK IT'S VALID.

448
00:13:54,832 --> 00:13:55,533
THAT'S WHAT I THINK.

449
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:57,601
[mutters]

450
00:13:57,601 --> 00:13:58,869
>> WELL, MAYBE I'M WRONG,

451
00:13:58,869 --> 00:13:59,637
HAROLD.

452
00:13:59,637 --> 00:14:00,704
MAYBE WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS GET

453
00:14:00,704 --> 00:14:02,573
OURSELVES A NEIGHBOR NAMED

454
00:14:02,573 --> 00:14:04,108
MILLIE, AND I'LL GET MARY TYLER

455
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:06,477
MOORE TO RUN THE BAIT SHOP, EH?

456
00:14:06,477 --> 00:14:07,678
AND WE CAN IMITATE EVERY OTHER

457
00:14:07,678 --> 00:14:09,346
SHOW ON TELEVISION.

458
00:14:09,346 --> 00:14:10,214
>> YEAH, BUT UNCLE RED, YOU'RE

459
00:14:10,214 --> 00:14:11,282
FORGETTING THAT IMITATION IS THE

460
00:14:11,282 --> 00:14:14,852
SINCEREST FORM OF FLATULENCE.

461
00:14:14,852 --> 00:14:15,586
>> I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT,

462
00:14:15,586 --> 00:14:17,855
HAROLD.

463
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,957
THIS IS NOT A SITUATION COMEDY.

464
00:14:19,957 --> 00:14:21,425
THIS IS A MAGAZINE SHOW FOR

465
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:22,159
SPORTSMEN.

466
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,861
>> AND WOMEN.

467
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:24,628
>> YEAH, WELL, THAT'S FINE.

468
00:14:24,628 --> 00:14:25,296
THAT'S FINE.

469
00:14:25,296 --> 00:14:26,130
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.

470
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,431
I'M JUST SAYING THAT I WANT--I'D

471
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:28,699
RATHER BE UNIQUE AND DO MY OWN

472
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:30,734
KIND OF SHOW AND NOT TRY TO

473
00:14:30,734 --> 00:14:32,870
IMITATE SOMEBODY ELSE JUST FOR

474
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:33,604
THE SAKE OF GETTIN' BETTER

475
00:14:33,604 --> 00:14:35,539
RATINGS.

476
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:37,107
>> "OH, ROB."

477
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:40,678
[laughs]

478
00:14:40,678 --> 00:14:42,579
MARY TYLER MOORE.

479
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:44,548
SORRY.

480
00:14:49,153 --> 00:14:50,154
>> I ALWAYS LOOK FORWARD TO

481
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:51,321
ADVENTURES WITH BILL 'CAUSE YOU

482
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:52,523
NEVER KNOW WHAT HE'S GONNA PULL

483
00:14:52,523 --> 00:14:55,592
OUT OF HIS PANTS, AND THIS WEEK,

484
00:14:55,592 --> 00:14:58,295
IT'S A COUPLE OF SLINGSHOTS.

485
00:14:58,295 --> 00:14:59,430
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE USED

486
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,098
TO DO WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

487
00:15:01,098 --> 00:15:01,765
I'M NOT GONNA GET INTO

488
00:15:01,765 --> 00:15:02,533
EVERYTHING THAT WE USE TO DO

489
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:03,901
WHEN WE WERE KIDS, BUT THESE ARE

490
00:15:03,901 --> 00:15:05,502
KIND OF FUN, JUST THE FEELIN'.

491
00:15:05,502 --> 00:15:06,303
THOSE ARE GREAT.

492
00:15:06,303 --> 00:15:07,104
IT'S GREAT.

493
00:15:07,104 --> 00:15:07,805
NO, NOT SO GREAT FOR BILL,

494
00:15:07,805 --> 00:15:08,572
MAYBE.

495
00:15:08,572 --> 00:15:09,840
>> OOH!

496
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,741
>> OH, BOY.

497
00:15:10,741 --> 00:15:13,444
YEAH, I'LL BET THAT SMARTS, HUH?

498
00:15:13,444 --> 00:15:14,111
YEAH.

499
00:15:14,111 --> 00:15:14,978
WELL, BILL JUST DID THAT TO SHOW

500
00:15:14,978 --> 00:15:16,847
ME THINGS THAT CAN GO WRONG WITH

501
00:15:16,847 --> 00:15:18,449
THE SLINGSHOT.

502
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:19,616
GOT HIMSELF A LITTLE TARGET.

503
00:15:19,616 --> 00:15:20,484
WATCH YOUR FOOT.

504
00:15:20,484 --> 00:15:21,185
OH, GOOD.

505
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:22,319
YEAH, YEAH.

506
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:25,022
SO HE'S IMPROVING, ISN'T HE?

507
00:15:25,022 --> 00:15:26,390
NOW, HE GIVES ME A LITTLE--ONE

508
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,492
OF THESE ROUNDED STONES, KIND OF

509
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:31,195
A LIGHT STONE THING, AND THEN

510
00:15:31,195 --> 00:15:32,529
WE'RE JUST GONNA FIRE OFF.

511
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:33,330
KIND OF FELT GOOD.

512
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,834
IT'S FUN. IT'S FUN. IT'S FUN.

513
00:15:36,834 --> 00:15:37,935
BILL HAD A--WELL, A COUPLE OF

514
00:15:37,935 --> 00:15:41,138
PROBLEMS, AND WE BOTH MISSED THE

515
00:15:41,138 --> 00:15:42,039
TARGET.

516
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:45,175
OH, WELL.

517
00:15:45,175 --> 00:15:46,710
OH, NO, HE'S GOT ANOTHER ONE.

518
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,978
YEAH. YEAH.

519
00:15:47,978 --> 00:15:50,214
AND A LITTLE MORE AMMO.

520
00:15:50,214 --> 00:15:51,515
I MUST ADMIT, I WAS HAVING--I

521
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:53,450
WAS HAVING A GOOD TIME, JUST

522
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,585
FIRE UP INTO THE AIR THERE,

523
00:15:54,585 --> 00:15:56,553
AND--OH!

524
00:15:56,553 --> 00:15:59,823
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY DO THAT,

525
00:15:59,823 --> 00:16:01,825
BUT THAT'S BILL.

526
00:16:01,825 --> 00:16:03,260
I'M SURE HE'S GOT A COUPLE MORE

527
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,796
SLINGSHOTS IN HIS PANTS THERE.

528
00:16:05,796 --> 00:16:07,097
THIS IS KIND OF AN UNUSUAL--NO,

529
00:16:07,097 --> 00:16:07,931
WAIT A--BILL.

530
00:16:07,931 --> 00:16:11,068
BILL, BILL, BILL.

531
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:14,338
RIGHT.

532
00:16:14,338 --> 00:16:15,005
WHAT ELSE?

533
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:17,040
OH, ANO--THIS IS A--NOW, THAT IS

534
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,042
A MAJOR PIECE OF WORK, THAT ONE

535
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:19,977
THERE.

536
00:16:19,977 --> 00:16:21,979
AND YEAH, HE HAD THE AMMO.

537
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:22,813
YOU WANT TO SHOOT THE WHOLE BOX

538
00:16:22,813 --> 00:16:23,914
IN ONE GO?

539
00:16:23,914 --> 00:16:25,682
BILL, COME ON, NOW.

540
00:16:25,682 --> 00:16:27,217
THIS IS A--WE'RE INTO TIMES OF

541
00:16:27,217 --> 00:16:28,952
DISARMAMENT.

542
00:16:28,952 --> 00:16:30,053
AND THE AMMO WAS--THESE ARE

543
00:16:30,053 --> 00:16:31,088
ACTUALLY STEEL BALLS, AND THEY

544
00:16:31,088 --> 00:16:32,990
COULD--THEY COULD TAKE YOUR EYE

545
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,458
OUT.

546
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,826
AND HE'S REALLY GOING FOR IT.

547
00:16:35,826 --> 00:16:38,362
OH.

548
00:16:38,362 --> 00:16:41,498
WELL, WE'RE JUST NOT GONNA TELL

549
00:16:41,498 --> 00:16:43,700
MOOSE THOMPSON ABOUT THAT.

550
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,768
NOW, WE SET UP THESE MASON JARS

551
00:16:44,768 --> 00:16:46,837
AS TARGETS AND ARE GONNA TO WORK

552
00:16:46,837 --> 00:16:50,140
ON OUR AIM, BUT BILL GOT

553
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,075
CREATIVE HERE AND MADE WHAT I

554
00:16:52,075 --> 00:16:56,313
WOULD CALL A NUCLEAR SLINGSHOT.

555
00:16:56,313 --> 00:16:57,748
NOW HE'S LOOKIN' FOR SUITABLE

556
00:16:57,748 --> 00:16:58,815
AMMO FOR IT.

557
00:16:58,815 --> 00:17:01,585
NOT BIG ENOUGH, NOT BIG ENOUGH.

558
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:05,722
THAT SEEMED TO STRIKE HIS FANCY.

559
00:17:05,722 --> 00:17:06,690
AND I'M GETTING A LITTLE WORRIED

560
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:07,891
AT THIS POINT, 'CAUSE THIS

561
00:17:07,891 --> 00:17:09,259
THING'S GOT A LOT OF TORQUE ON

562
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:11,061
IT THERE, AND HE'S GONNA FIRE

563
00:17:11,061 --> 00:17:12,195
THAT BRICK, AND MAYBE TAKE MY

564
00:17:12,195 --> 00:17:13,830
HAT OFF,

565
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,265

PERFECT.

570
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,541
>> IT IS WINTER.

571
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:25,976
DASHING THROUGH THE SNOW

572
00:17:25,976 --> 00:17:27,577
IN A ONE-HORSE OPEN SLEIGH

573
00:17:27,577 --> 00:17:29,513
JUST LIKE YOUR GRANDPARENTS DID,

574
00:17:29,513 --> 00:17:31,448
ONLY IT'S COSTING YOU

575
00:17:31,448 --> 00:17:33,416
100 BUCKS AN HOUR.

576
00:17:41,992 --> 00:17:43,126
>> UNCLE RED, WHAT DO YOU THINK

577
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:44,528
OF THE WAY OUR GOVERNMENT'S

578
00:17:44,528 --> 00:17:45,795
RUNNING THIS COUNTRY?

579
00:17:45,795 --> 00:17:47,764
YOU KNOW, SAY WITH THE ECONOMY?

580
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,934
>> IN WHAT AREA?

581
00:17:50,934 --> 00:17:51,601
>> OH, I DON'T KNOW.

582
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:52,269
I DON'T KNOW.

583
00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:53,703
YOU KNOW, JUST SAY MINIMUM WAGE

584
00:17:53,703 --> 00:17:54,738
FOR STARTERS.

585
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:55,405
YEAH.

586
00:17:55,405 --> 00:17:56,273
>> YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

587
00:17:56,273 --> 00:17:58,775
WELL, THE--I LIKE MINIMUM WAGE.

00:17:58,775 --> 00:17:59,776
>> ME TOO.

589
00:17:59,776 --> 00:18:01,344
ME TOO, WITH A QUALIFIER, OF

590
00:18:01,344 --> 00:18:02,312
COURSE.

591
00:18:02,312 --> 00:18:03,480
YOU KNOW, MANY OF MY FRIENDS AND

592
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,948
SEVERAL OF MY GRANDPARENTS ARE

593
00:18:04,948 --> 00:18:07,150
WORKING FOR MINIMUM WAGE.

594
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,118
>> YEAH, MOST OF THEM ARE

595
00:18:08,118 --> 00:18:10,553
FLIPPING HAMBURGERS, HAROLD.

596
00:18:10,553 --> 00:18:11,521
>> GRANTED, TRUE.

597
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:12,389
AND YES.

598
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:13,523
OKAY, YES, GRANDMA GREEN IS NOT

599
00:18:13,523 --> 00:18:15,158
THE FASTEST BURGER FLIPPER.

600
00:18:15,158 --> 00:18:16,793
BUT OTHER PEOPLE ARE IN

601
00:18:16,793 --> 00:18:18,595
POSITIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY, AND

602
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:19,596
I THINK THEY SHOULD BE MAKING

603
00:18:19,596 --> 00:18:21,097
MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE.

604
00:18:21,097 --> 00:18:22,532
I.E., PEOPLE IN THE COURIER

605
00:18:22,532 --> 00:18:25,068
INDUSTRY OR THOSE PRODUCING AND

606
00:18:25,068 --> 00:18:28,071
DIRECTING A TELEVISION SHOW.

607
00:18:28,071 --> 00:18:29,105
>> THINK I JUST SAW A RED FLAG

608
00:18:29,105 --> 00:18:30,040
GO BY THERE, HAROLD.

609
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,940
>> WELL, I'M JUST SAYIN', UNCLE

610
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,242
RED, THAT PRODUCING AND

611
00:18:32,242 --> 00:18:33,309
DIRECTING A SHOW LIKE YOURS DOES

612
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:34,444
NOT STRIKE ME AS A JOB THAT

613
00:18:34,444 --> 00:18:38,148
SHOULD BE PAYING MINIMUM WAGE.

614
00:18:38,148 --> 00:18:38,915
>> WELL, IT'S EITHER THAT OR

615
00:18:38,915 --> 00:18:40,350
NOTHING.

616
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,618
>> WELL, I'M OPTING FOR THE

617
00:18:41,618 --> 00:18:43,153
STATUS QUO.

618
00:18:43,153 --> 00:18:45,121
CAN I CHOP THAT WOOD FOR YOU?

619
00:18:55,064 --> 00:18:57,033
THERE'S NO INSTRUCTIONS.

620
00:18:58,468 --> 00:18:59,335
>> WE'RE GONNA TAKE THIS LITTLE

621
00:18:59,335 --> 00:19:00,370
COMMERCIAL BREAK SO THAT I CAN

622
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,772
REMEMBER THE SALT SHAKER STORY.

623
00:19:02,772 --> 00:19:04,474
>> BUT HE MIGHT NOT, SO STAY

624
00:19:04,474 --> 00:19:06,443
TUNED.

625
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:15,919
>> I KNOW A LOT OF YOU HAVE JUST

626
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,520
TURNED 16, AND YOU'VE ALREADY

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,356
SMASHED UP THE FAMILY CAR

628
00:19:20,356 --> 00:19:21,424
SO NOW YOU'RE FORCED TO STAY

629
00:19:21,424 --> 00:19:23,359
HOME AND WATCH THIS SHOW.

630
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:24,260
I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT BEING

631
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,528
OLD ENOUGH TO VOTE.

632
00:19:25,528 --> 00:19:26,596
IT'S JUST AROUND THE CORNER, YOU

633
00:19:26,596 --> 00:19:27,463
KNOW.

634
00:19:27,463 --> 00:19:28,531
SO WAS THE TAVERN, BUT OF

COURSE, THAT'S NOT OPEN ON

636
00:19:29,566 --> 00:19:30,833
ELECTION DAY.

637
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:31,968
IF THEY KEPT THE BARS OPEN, THE

638
00:19:31,968 --> 00:19:33,002
POLITICIANS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO

639
00:19:33,002 --> 00:19:34,404
STAND FOR THE OFFICE THEY JUST

640
00:19:34,404 --> 00:19:36,206
RECEIVED.

641
00:19:36,206 --> 00:19:37,073

00:19:59,462 --> 00:20:00,630
>> OH, NOTHING.

656
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,098
I JUST COME BY TO SEE HOW YOU

657

WHAT WERE YOU DOING DOWN THERE,

659
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:04,968

WHAT'S THAT LIKE?

672
00:20:16,346 --> 00:20:17,847

I TOLD THEM THIS WOULD HAPPEN

677
00:20:21,884 --> 00:20:22,618
WHEN THEY BROUGHT IN THAT

678
00:20:22,618 --> 00:20:24,020

683
00:20:30,026 --> 00:20:30,693
I'M SORRY.

684
00:20:30,693 --> 00:20:31,461
>> WELL, IT'S--AND, JACK--

685
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:32,295

696
00:20:43,806 --> 00:20:45,074
BE ABLE TO COOK IN MY CAVE.

697
00:20:45,074 --> 00:20:46,776

I HAVEN'T PLANTED THEM YET.

735
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:48,337
>> WHAT A KIBITZER.

736
00:21:53,943 --> 00:21:55,578
ANYWAY, TO MAKE A LONG STORY

737
00:21:55,578 --> 00:21:58,214
FINISHED, MOOSE MADE THE SALT

738
00:21:58,214 --> 00:21:59,382
AND PEPPER SHAKERS OUT OF

739
00:21:59,382 --> 00:22:00,916

741
00:22:02,418 --> 00:22:03,853

00:22:03,853 --> 00:22:05,221
LIVE AMMO ON THE DINING ROOM

743
00:22:05,221 --> 00:22:06,155

744
00:22:06,155 --> 00:22:07,556

AND PEPPER SHAKERS.

747
00:22:10,393 --> 00:22:11,994
SO BUSTER FIRES OFF THE SALT AND

748
00:22:11,994 --> 00:22:13,029
PEPPER, BRINGS DOWN A COUPLE OF

749
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:13,829

750
00:22:13,829 --> 00:22:15,231
NOW, WE HAD TO CLEAN 'EM AND

751
00:22:15,231 --> 00:22:16,198
PLUCK 'EM, BUT THEY DIDN'T NEED

752
00:22:16,198 --> 00:22:18,134
ANY SPICES.

753
00:22:18,134 --> 00:22:19,135
AND I COOKED THE DUCKS UP FOR

754
00:22:19,135 --> 00:22:20,503
DINNER, IN FACT, AND, GOD, WE

755
00:22:20,503 --> 00:22:22,071

00:22:27,143 --> 00:22:28,044
BRING OUT THE SALT AND PEPPER

759
00:22:28,044 --> 00:22:29,078

00:22:40,389 --> 00:22:41,290
WELL, THEN OF COURSE, WE ALL HAD

DINING ROOM MOOSE HEAD.

775
00:22:52,802 --> 00:22:53,936
BUT THEN MOOSE HAS ALWAYS BEEN
