00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:46,158
IS OPEN GARAGE DOORS.

102

RATHER THAN JUST TAKE IT AND

103
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,495
THROW IT IN THE LAKE, WHAT YOU

104
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:50,830
SHOULD DO IS USE YOUR

105
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,997
IMAGINATION AND THINK OF SOME

00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:16,822
DINNER, BUT I DON'T WANT TO

121
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:17,656
MISS THE GAME.

122
00:04:17,656 --> 00:04:18,824
WITH THE GARAGE DOOR OPENER,

123
00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:20,493
I CAN JUST STAY BACK,

124
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:21,327
AND I'VE GOT THE BINOCULARS

125
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,328
TO KIND OF CHECK ON HOW

126
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,162
THE DINNER'S GOING, SO I'LL

127

JUST SHOW YOU HOW IT WORKS.

128
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:26,265

IS JUST TURN THE UNIT OFF,

I GUESS.

143

ABOUT HAVING YOUR OWN PERSONAL

YOU CAN DO IT JUST LIKE I'VE

IT CAN WORK, AND A LOT OF OTHER

IDEAS--YOU'RE ONLY LIMITED BY

YOUR OWN IMAGINATION.

SO UNTIL NEXT TIME, REMEMBER,

ON OLD MAN SEDGEWICK,

AND OLD MAN SEDGEWICK

196
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:12,831
WAS ASLEEP BY THE WOODSTOVE.

197
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:14,333
IN FACT, HE HAD HIS LEGS WRAPPED

UP AGAINST THE CHIMNEY.

SO STINKY SNEAKS IN THERE, AND

201
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,504
HE OPENS UP THE STOVE, AND HE

202
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:21,340
DROPS IN A BOX OF FIRECRACKERS,

203
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,341
AND HE PUTS THE LID BACK ON,

AND HE GOES INTO THE NEXT ROOM,

205

AND THEN HE WAITS, YOU KNOW,

206
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:26,345
AND THEN HE COMES BACK IN,

207
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:27,346
AND HE OPENS UP THE STOVE, AND

208
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,014
HE TAKES THE FIRECRACKERS OUT,

209
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:31,183
AND THEN HE STARTS A FIRE.

210
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:32,184
THEN HE PUTS THE FIRECRACKERS

211
00:07:32,184 --> 00:07:33,018
IN, AND THEN HE PUTS--

212
00:07:33,018 --> 00:07:34,019
AND THEN HE GOES INTO THE NEXT

213
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:35,687
ROOM, AND THEN HE WAITS.

214
00:07:35,687 --> 00:07:36,855
WELL, AFTER ABOUT TEN SECONDS,

215
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:37,856
THEY ALL GO OFF AT ONCE--

FACE, UNTIL IT WAS ALL OVER,

224
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:50,302
AND THEN HE SAID,

225
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:52,971
"HOW WAS IT FOR YOU?"

00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:33,464
>> I DON'T SEE ANYBODY, THOUGH.

340
00:10:33,464 --> 00:10:35,800
>> OH, HERE.

341
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,801
SHE'S IN THAT BIG WINDOW

342
00:10:36,801 --> 00:10:39,304
OUT FRONT.

343
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:40,204
I DON'T REALLY KNOW IF HER NAME

344
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:41,205
IS SAMANTHA.

345
00:10:41,205 --> 00:10:42,373
I JUST IMAGINE IT'S SAMANTHA.

346
00:10:42,373 --> 00:10:43,374
>> YEAH?

347
00:10:43,374 --> 00:10:44,375
>> JUST KNOWING SHE'S THERE IS

348
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,044
COMFORTING, THOUGH.

349
00:10:46,044 --> 00:10:49,047
I WONDER WHAT HER REAL NAME IS.

350
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:49,881
WOULD IT BE TOO MUCH OF A

351
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:51,049
COINCIDENCE IF IT WAS SAMANTHA,

352
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:53,551
HUH?

353
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:54,385
>> UH, RANGER GORD,

354
00:10:54,385 --> 00:10:58,056
THAT'S A LOG.

355
00:10:58,056 --> 00:10:59,057
I CAN SEE THE WINDOW, AND IT

356
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:00,725
LOOKS A BIT LIKE A WOMAN, BUT,

357
00:11:00,725 --> 00:11:03,394
UH, THAT'S A LOG.

358
00:11:03,394 --> 00:11:04,395
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

359
00:11:04,395 --> 00:11:05,897
IT'S A WOMAN.

360
00:11:05,897 --> 00:11:06,564
>> NO, NO, THAT'S A LOG.

361
00:11:06,564 --> 00:11:08,700
TAKE A LOOK YOURSELF.

362
00:11:13,337 --> 00:11:14,172
>> I'M IN LOVE WITH

363
00:11:14,172 --> 00:11:17,508
A FALLEN LOG.

364
00:11:17,508 --> 00:11:18,509
>> WE GOT TO GET GOING.

365
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:19,310
IT WAS REALLY GOOD TO SEE YOU

366
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:19,977
AGAIN, EH?

367
00:11:19,977 --> 00:11:20,645
>> COME ON.

368
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:21,312
STICK AROUND FOR A BIT.

369
00:11:21,312 --> 00:11:22,980
>> WELL, UH, MAYBE ANOTHER TIME

370
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,048
WE'LL STAY OVER, OKAY, BUT NOT

371
00:11:24,048 --> 00:11:24,715
THIS TIME.

372
00:11:24,715 --> 00:11:25,416
>> OH, COME ON, I WAS GONNA

373
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:26,084
HAVE A BIG BARBECUE.

374
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:27,585
I GOT CANNED CORN, AND I GOT

375
00:11:27,585 --> 00:11:28,419
SOME BEANS FOR SPECIAL

376
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:29,087
OCCASIONS.

377
00:11:29,087 --> 00:11:29,921
I WAS GONNA INVITE SAMANTHA

378
00:11:29,921 --> 00:11:33,591
OVER--

379
00:11:33,591 --> 00:11:34,425
I GUESS THERE'S NO POINT

380
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:35,426
IN INVITING SAMANTHA OVER NOW,

381
00:11:35,426 --> 00:11:36,594
IS THERE?

382
00:11:36,594 --> 00:11:37,428
>> WELL, NOT UNLESS YOU NEED

383
00:11:37,428 --> 00:11:38,429
FIREWOOD.

384
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:40,398
>> SHUT UP!

385
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,250
[folksy guitar and spoons music plays]

386
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:45,102
>> THERE ARE MANY

387
00:11:45,102 --> 00:11:46,270
FINE HOBBIES

388
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,272
A PERSON CAN DO

389
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:50,274
LIKE COLLECTING THINGS

390
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:53,110
YOU FIND ON YOUR SHOE

391
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,612
WALKING ON BEES

392
00:11:54,612 --> 00:11:56,781
AND DANCING WITH SHEEP

393
00:11:56,781 --> 00:11:58,616
BUT GUYS AND ME

394
00:11:58,616 --> 00:12:00,618
WE LIKE TO SLEEP

395
00:12:00,618 --> 00:12:01,619
SLEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT

396
00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:02,987
>> SLEEP, ALL NIGHT!

397
00:12:02,987 --> 00:12:04,488
>> SLEEP HALF THE DAY

398
00:12:04,488 --> 00:12:06,657
LIE BACK AND SLEEP

399
00:12:06,657 --> 00:12:08,659
YOUR WHOLE LIFE AWAY

400
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:10,661
UP IN THE BUNKHOUSE

401
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:13,164
SNORING AND WORSE

402
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:15,166
BUT THE BEST SLEEP OF ALL

403
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:18,903
IS A RIDE IN THE HEARSE

404
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,841
>> OH, UNCLE RED, PERFECT.

405
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:24,842
THIS IS GREAT.

406
00:12:24,842 --> 00:12:26,177
IT'S MAIL BAG TIME, OKAY?

407
00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:27,178
SO YOU CHOOSE THE GREEN CHAIR,

408
00:12:27,178 --> 00:12:27,979
BECAUSE I'VE ALREADY CHOSEN

409
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:28,813
THE WHITE CHAIR, AND I HAVE

410
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:29,547
A LETTER HERE.

411
00:12:29,547 --> 00:12:30,314
I'LL READ IT OUT LOUD,

412
00:12:30,314 --> 00:12:31,315
AND YOU CAN ANSWER IT, RIGHT?

413
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:32,116
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO ON

414
00:12:32,116 --> 00:12:32,783
EVERY SEGMENT.

415
00:12:32,783 --> 00:12:33,618
WE SHOULD CONTINUE WITH THAT,

416
00:12:33,618 --> 00:12:34,385
I MEAN, IF IT'S CONVENIENT

417
00:12:34,385 --> 00:12:35,286
WITH YOU.

418
00:12:35,286 --> 00:12:36,287
>> JUST READ THE LETTER, HAROLD,

419
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:37,121
WOULD YOU?

420
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:37,788
>> OKAY.

421
00:12:37,788 --> 00:12:38,456
ALL RIGHTY.

422
00:12:38,456 --> 00:12:39,123
THAT'S GOOD.

423
00:12:39,123 --> 00:12:39,790
THAT'S A YES.

424
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,458
OKAY.

425
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,626
"DEAR RED, EVER SINCE MY HUSBAND

426
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:42,960
RETIRED, HE'S BEEN HANGING

427
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,928
AROUND THE HOUSE

428
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:45,396
GETTING ON MY NERVES.

429
00:12:45,396 --> 00:12:46,731
HE SHUFFLES AROUND AT ODDS,

430
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:47,732
COMPLAINING AND GROUSING.

431
00:12:47,732 --> 00:12:49,066
IT'S DRIVING ME NUTS.

432
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:50,568
I CAN'T TAKE MUCH MORE OF THIS.

433
00:12:50,568 --> 00:12:52,570
IS THERE ANY HOPE FOR ME?"

434
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,571
>> WELL, HAROLD, THIS IS

435
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:54,905
SOMETHING WE'VE HEARD BEFORE,

436
00:12:54,905 --> 00:12:55,906
WHERE A FELLOW RETIRES,

437
00:12:55,906 --> 00:12:58,075
AND HE CAN'T FIND ENOUGH TO DO.

438
00:12:58,075 --> 00:12:59,410
WHAT THIS WOMAN HAS TO DO IS TO

439
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,078
FIND A HOBBY FOR HER HUSBAND,

440
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:02,079
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING TO KEEP HIM

441
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,647
KIND OF INTERESTED AND OCCUPIED.

442
00:13:03,647 --> 00:13:06,650
I SUGGEST WATCHING TELEVISION.

443
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,818
IT'S EDUCATIONAL, IT'S

444
00:13:07,818 --> 00:13:09,320
ENTERTAINING, AND HE CAN DO IT

445
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,155
DAY AND NIGHT EVEN WHEN THEY

446
00:13:11,155 --> 00:13:13,891
HAVE GUESTS OVER.

447
00:13:13,891 --> 00:13:15,059
>> YEAH, BUT, UNCLE RED, IT'S

448
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:16,894
NOT MUCH OF A SOCIAL ACTIVITY,

449
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:17,995
REALLY, IS IT?

450
00:13:17,995 --> 00:13:19,497
WATCHING TV IS OKAY EVERY NOW

451
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:20,598
AND THEN, BUT IT'S REALLY NOT

452
00:13:20,598 --> 00:13:21,932
A HOBBY, NOT LIKE, YOU KNOW,

453
00:13:21,932 --> 00:13:24,101
LIKE STAMP COLLECTING OR MAKING

454
00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:25,603
CABINETS OR PRODUCING MUSIC

455
00:13:25,603 --> 00:13:27,438
VIDEOS FOR NEW WAVE BANDS,

456
00:13:27,438 --> 00:13:28,439
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING CREATIVE

457
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:29,273
LIKE THAT.

458
00:13:29,273 --> 00:13:30,074
DON'T YOU THINK THAT'D BE

459
00:13:30,074 --> 00:13:30,908
A BETTER SUGGESTION AT

460
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:32,076
THIS JUNCTURE IN TIME?

461
00:13:32,076 --> 00:13:32,943
DON'T YOU THINK?

462
00:13:32,943 --> 00:13:34,779
>> WELL, ALL RIGHT, HAROLD,

463
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:36,781
I DID HEAR OF THIS ONE FELLOW

464
00:13:36,781 --> 00:13:38,282
THAT, WHEN HE RETIRED, HE DID

465
00:13:38,282 --> 00:13:39,283
SOMETHING HE WANTED TO DO HIS

466
00:13:39,283 --> 00:13:40,618
WHOLE LIFE, WHICH IS, UH--

467
00:13:40,618 --> 00:13:42,286
WHICH IS CARVING STATUES

468
00:13:42,286 --> 00:13:44,455
OUT OF WOOD WITH A CHAIN SAW.

469
00:13:44,455 --> 00:13:46,957
IT GOT HIM OUTDOORS, AND HE

470
00:13:46,957 --> 00:13:48,125
WOULD BE CARVING THEM OUT OF

471
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,127
THOSE BIG TREE TRUNKS, YOU KNOW,

472
00:13:50,127 --> 00:13:51,462
SO HE WAS GETTING HIS FRESH AIR,

473
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:52,796
AND THAT WAS A CREATIVE THING,

474
00:13:52,796 --> 00:13:55,065
AND PLUS, CARRYING AROUND

475
00:13:55,065 --> 00:13:56,901
A 40-POUND CHAIN SAW REALLY

476
00:13:56,901 --> 00:13:58,235
KEEPS THE OLD TICKER IN SHAPE.

477
00:13:58,235 --> 00:13:59,803
>> 40 POUNDS?

478
00:13:59,803 --> 00:14:01,639
>> WELL, YOU NEED THE SAW WITH

479
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:02,806
THE 6-FOOT BLADE ON THERE TO CUT

480
00:14:02,806 --> 00:14:04,208
THROUGH THE HEAVIER WOODS.

481
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,209
>> YEAH, YOU CAN'T EVEN LIFT

482
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:06,443
ONE OF THOSE.

483
00:14:06,443 --> 00:14:07,444
>> WELL, THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

484
00:14:07,444 --> 00:14:09,613
I'M NOT RETIRED YET.

485
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:11,282
NOW, HE WOULD JUST CARVE

486
00:14:11,282 --> 00:14:13,784
STRICTLY CATFISH, BUT YOU COULD

487
00:14:13,784 --> 00:14:16,453
DO INSECTS OR EVEN CHILDREN

488
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:18,322
WITH THE LARGE, SAD EYES.

489
00:14:18,322 --> 00:14:19,089
>> I BET YOU THERE'S A GOOD

490
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:19,924
MARKET FOR THAT TOO--

491
00:14:19,924 --> 00:14:20,758
A REAL HUGE MARKET.

492
00:14:20,758 --> 00:14:21,659
I BET YOU THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

493
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:22,826
I BET YOU THERE IS.

494
00:14:22,826 --> 00:14:23,494
THAT'S WHAT I THINK.

495
00:14:23,494 --> 00:14:24,228
I BET YOU.

496
00:14:24,228 --> 00:14:26,230
>> WELL, THE CATFISH SOLD WELL.

497
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,965
THEY WERE ABOUT 10 FEET LONG,

498
00:14:27,965 --> 00:14:29,800
MADE OF REDWOOD, HECK OF A LAWN

499
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,302
ORNAMENT.

500
00:14:31,302 --> 00:14:32,636
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE ACTUALLY

501
00:14:32,636 --> 00:14:35,472
FEEDING RIGHT ON THE LAWN THERE.

502
00:14:35,472 --> 00:14:37,641
I HEARD AN AMUSEMENT PARK IN

503
00:14:37,641 --> 00:14:39,476
MISSOURI BOUGHT ABOUT 40 OF THEM

504
00:14:39,476 --> 00:14:41,812
AND MADE A HUGE CATFISH

505
00:14:41,812 --> 00:14:43,647
MERRY-GO-ROUND.

506
00:14:43,647 --> 00:14:46,150
BUT AFTER ABOUT FIVE YEARS OF

507
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,317
MAKING--HE'D DONE SO WELL

508
00:14:47,317 --> 00:14:48,652
WITH THESE, HE HAD ENOUGH MONEY

509
00:14:48,652 --> 00:14:51,588
TO BUY HIMSELF A NEW CHAIN SAW.

510
00:14:51,588 --> 00:14:53,590
>> OH, HEY, THAT'S GREAT.

511
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,591
I BET YOU THAT ANSWERS OUR

512
00:14:54,591 --> 00:14:57,261
LADY VIEWER'S QUESTION.

513
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:58,595
>> YEAH, IT'S A GOOD HOBBY, AND

514
00:14:58,595 --> 00:14:59,930
IF THE HUSBAND GETS BORED WITH

515
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,432
IT OR SOMETHING, AND HE'S STILL

516
00:15:01,432 --> 00:15:02,833
GETTING ON HER NERVES, SHE CAN

517
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:03,734
JUST, YOU KNOW, USE THE

518
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:04,601
CHAIN SAW ON HIM.

519
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:05,936
>> OH, NO, NO, UNCLE RED, NO.

520
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:06,603
HE'S KIDDING.

521
00:15:06,603 --> 00:15:07,337
TELL HER YOU'RE KIDDING,

522
00:15:07,337 --> 00:15:08,005
UNCLE RED.

523
00:15:08,005 --> 00:15:08,839
DON'T SAY THINGS LIKE THAT.

524
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:09,840
TELL HER YOU'RE KIDDING.

525
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,674
>> WELL, WHATEVER.

526
00:15:10,674 --> 00:15:12,643
>> HE'S KIDDING.

527
00:15:24,655 --> 00:15:25,656
>> ONE OF THE THINGS BILL

528
00:15:25,656 --> 00:15:27,324
WANTED TO SHOW YOU WAS HOW

529
00:15:27,324 --> 00:15:29,159
YOU CAN SURVIVE IN THE FOREST

530
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,661
BY FISHING.

531
00:15:30,661 --> 00:15:31,495
EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE

532
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:32,830
NO EQUIPMENT, YOU CAN JUST FIND

533
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,499
THINGS AROUND THAT YOU CAN USE.

534
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:36,834
THE FIRST THING HE WANTS TO SHOW

535
00:15:36,834 --> 00:15:38,168
YOU IS HOW TO DO A LITTLE

536
00:15:38,168 --> 00:15:39,336
SPEARFISHING.

537
00:15:39,336 --> 00:15:41,004
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS SOME

538
00:15:41,004 --> 00:15:44,007
SORT OF A BRANCH OR A TREE LIMB.

539
00:15:44,007 --> 00:15:45,175
NOW, THAT ONE'S GOT TOO MUCH OF

540
00:15:45,175 --> 00:15:46,009
A CURVE; YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

541
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:47,511
SOMETHING STRAIGHT.

542
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:48,512
AND THAT'S GOT TOO MANY

543
00:15:48,512 --> 00:15:50,013
BRANCHES ON IT.

544
00:15:50,013 --> 00:15:51,882
NOW, THAT LOOKS BETTER.

545
00:15:51,882 --> 00:15:52,883
>> [grunts]

546
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:56,887
>> OH, BOY, OH, BOY, OH, BOY.

547
00:15:56,887 --> 00:15:57,888
THAT SMARTS.

548
00:15:57,888 --> 00:15:59,389
OOH.

549
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:00,390
HE'S OKAY.

550
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,725
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

551
00:16:01,725 --> 00:16:02,559
DON'T FORGET THE POLE,

552
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,063
ALL RIGHT.

553
00:16:06,063 --> 00:16:06,897
SO NEXT THING, HE'S GOT TO

554
00:16:06,897 --> 00:16:08,732
SHARPEN THE END THERE AND--

555
00:16:08,732 --> 00:16:10,567
OH, FOR GOSH SAKE.

556
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:11,401
CHECK YOUR KNIFE.

557
00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:12,402
ALWAYS CHECK YOUR KNIFE.

558
00:16:12,402 --> 00:16:13,570
SEE HOW THE WATER REFRACTS

559
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,404
THINGS?

560
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:15,305
THEY LOOK BENT, AND THIS IS WHAT

561
00:16:15,305 --> 00:16:16,139
YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL OF WHEN

562
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:17,808
YOU'RE SPEARFISHING.

563
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:20,644
OH, ALL RIGHT, OKAY, WELL,

564
00:16:20,644 --> 00:16:21,979
THAT ONE WASN'T--

565
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:23,647
BUT YOU GET THE IDEA.

566
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:25,148
SO NOW BILL KIND OF HAS TO ALLOW

567
00:16:25,148 --> 00:16:26,984
FOR THAT ANGLE WHEN HE GOES FOR

568
00:16:26,984 --> 00:16:29,319
THE FISH, AND...

569
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:30,320
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT DOES

570
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,989
AT ALL.

571
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:35,158
HE SEEMS LIKE HE'S--

572
00:16:35,158 --> 00:16:35,993
THERE, I THINK HE'S GOT

573
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:36,660
SOMETHING.

574
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,327
I THINK HE'S GOT ONE.

575
00:16:37,327 --> 00:16:38,495
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, HE'S GOOD.

576
00:16:38,495 --> 00:16:39,329
WELL, BILL'S BEEN DOING THIS

577
00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:39,997
A LONG TIME.

578
00:16:39,997 --> 00:16:42,132
HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.

579
00:16:44,835 --> 00:16:46,336
WELL, SOMETIMES HE KNOWS WHAT

580
00:16:46,336 --> 00:16:47,003
HE'S DOING.

581
00:16:47,003 --> 00:16:48,972
>> OKAY.

582
00:16:51,842 --> 00:16:52,676
>> SO GIVE UP ON THE

583
00:16:52,676 --> 00:16:53,343
SPEARFISHING.

584
00:16:53,343 --> 00:16:54,177
THEY'RE GONNA TRY TO MAKE

585
00:16:54,177 --> 00:16:55,345
A FISHING POLE OUT OF THIS,

586
00:16:55,345 --> 00:16:56,179
AND THE NEXT THING HE NEEDS,

587
00:16:56,179 --> 00:16:57,681
HE ONLY NEEDS A LINE.

588
00:16:57,681 --> 00:16:59,015
NOW, BILL HAS AN INTERESTING

589
00:16:59,015 --> 00:16:59,683
APPROACH.

590
00:16:59,683 --> 00:17:01,518
HE USES A THREAD RIGHT OUT OF

591
00:17:01,518 --> 00:17:04,521
HIS CLOTHES.

592
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:05,789
AND WHAT HE'S GONNA DO IS,

593
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:08,625
I GUESS, PUT THIS ON...

594
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,128
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

595
00:17:11,128 --> 00:17:12,462
PUT THAT ON--UH, EASY THERE,

596
00:17:12,462 --> 00:17:13,630
BILL, EASY, EASY, EASY, EASY,

597
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,298
EASY, EASY, EASY, EASY.

598
00:17:15,298 --> 00:17:16,133
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,

599
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:16,800
WE'RE OKAY.

600
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,301
AND, OH, LOOK WHAT HE'S DOING

601
00:17:18,301 --> 00:17:20,637
HERE--KIBITZING AROUND.

602
00:17:20,637 --> 00:17:21,538
THAT WON'T WORK BECAUSE MY

603
00:17:21,538 --> 00:17:25,208
CLOTHES ARE STAPLED TOGETHER.

604
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,143
AND HE'S GONNA--

605
00:17:26,143 --> 00:17:27,978
OH, THAT BILL IS A REAL KIDDER.

606
00:17:27,978 --> 00:17:29,146
BUT HE'S GATHERING UP

607
00:17:29,146 --> 00:17:29,813
THE THREAD.

608
00:17:29,813 --> 00:17:30,814
I GUESS THAT'S PROBABLY ENOUGH,

609
00:17:30,814 --> 00:17:31,648
BILL, DON'T YOU THINK?

610
00:17:31,648 --> 00:17:33,316
PROBABLY ENOUGH, BILL, BILL?

611
00:17:33,316 --> 00:17:36,653
OH, BOY, OKAY.

612
00:17:36,653 --> 00:17:38,321
ALL RIGHT, HE WINDS THAT ONTO

613
00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:39,356
THE ROD THERE.

614
00:17:39,356 --> 00:17:40,357
AND NOW WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO IS

615
00:17:40,357 --> 00:17:42,025
FIND SOME BAIT, SO HE'S LOOKING

616
00:17:42,025 --> 00:17:43,693
FOR--I THINK HE'S LOOKING FOR

617
00:17:43,693 --> 00:17:44,928
A WORM HERE, LOOKING UNDER ROCKS

618
00:17:44,928 --> 00:17:48,932
AND...NOTHING THERE.

619
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:52,269
WHAT'S THIS?

620
00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:52,936
pop!

621
00:17:52,936 --> 00:17:53,937
>> OH!

622
00:17:53,937 --> 00:17:55,939
>> OH...OH, MY GOD.

623
00:17:55,939 --> 00:17:57,107
I DIDN'T--I WONDER HOW LONG THAT

624
00:17:57,107 --> 00:17:59,109
WAS IN THERE.

625
00:17:59,109 --> 00:18:00,777
OH...

626
00:18:00,777 --> 00:18:01,444
>> OUCH!

627
00:18:01,444 --> 00:18:02,445
>> BILL DOESN'T LIKE PUTTING

628
00:18:02,445 --> 00:18:03,747
THE WORM ON THE HOOK, DOES HE?

629
00:18:03,747 --> 00:18:06,750
WELL, GOD--WELL, ANYWAY, HE'S

630
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,751
ALL SET, AND THEN HE GOES--

631
00:18:07,751 --> 00:18:09,085
THROWS THE BAIT INTO THE WATER,

632
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:10,587
AND HE'S--LOOK AT THAT.

633
00:18:10,587 --> 00:18:11,921
THERE'S A MAN--OH, JEEZ.

634
00:18:11,921 --> 00:18:12,589
HE'S GOT ONE.

635
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:13,923
HE'S GOT SOMETHING THERE.

636
00:18:13,923 --> 00:18:14,924
HE'S GOT SOMETHING.

637
00:18:14,924 --> 00:18:16,426
OH, HE'S--SEE, THERE?

638
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:17,260
WOW.

639
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:17,994
IT'S PUTTING UP A FIGHT.

640
00:18:17,994 --> 00:18:18,662
THIS IS A GOOD ONE.

641
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:19,496
THIS IS A GOOD ONE.

642
00:18:19,496 --> 00:18:20,330
OH, THIS IS GREAT.

643
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,297
THIS IS GREAT.

644
00:18:21,297 --> 00:18:22,298
I LIKE THAT LOOK WITH THE PANTS

645
00:18:22,298 --> 00:18:23,133
ROLLED UP.

646
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:23,800
BE CAREFUL NOW, BILL,

647
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,469
BE CAREFUL--OH.

648
00:18:26,469 --> 00:18:27,303
AH, HE'S ALL RIGHT.

649
00:18:27,303 --> 00:18:28,304
AND HE HAULS HER IN.

650
00:18:28,304 --> 00:18:28,972
THAT'S A BIG ONE.

651
00:18:28,972 --> 00:18:31,141
HE'S GOT--WAIT A MINUTE.

652
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:33,543
OH, FOR GOSH SAKE.

653
00:18:33,543 --> 00:18:34,711
OH...

654
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:35,378
THEN HE MAKES US EAT

655
00:18:35,378 --> 00:18:37,380
WHATEVER HE CATCHES.

656
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,382
BUT HE'S HAPPY TO SHARE--MORE

657
00:18:39,382 --> 00:18:43,386
THAN HAPPY TO SHARE, I THINK.

658
00:18:43,386 --> 00:18:45,722
"EAT IT," HE SAYS.

659
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:47,057
"IT IS WINTER.

660
00:18:47,057 --> 00:18:50,894
A LITTLE VOICE SAYS, 'ME, ME,

661
00:18:50,894 --> 00:18:51,895
YOU'RE OUT OF WINDSHIELD WIPER

662
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:53,863
FLUID AGAIN.'"

663
00:19:04,974 --> 00:19:06,209
ALL RIGHT, AT THIS POINT,

664
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:07,043
I'D LIKE TO BRING THE SHOW

665
00:19:07,043 --> 00:19:08,545
TO A COMPLETE HALT

666
00:19:08,545 --> 00:19:09,712
AND GIVE HAROLD A CHANCE TO SAY

667
00:19:09,712 --> 00:19:11,047
A FEW WORDS.

668
00:19:11,047 --> 00:19:12,549
HAROLD, THE FLOOR IS YOURS.

669
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:15,552
DON'T MESS IT UP.

670
00:19:15,552 --> 00:19:17,720
>> OKAY, UM, MUSIC VIDEOS,

671
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,388
RIGHT?

672
00:19:18,388 --> 00:19:19,722
OKAY, A LOT OF SO-CALLED

673
00:19:19,722 --> 00:19:21,191
EDUCATORS AND A LOT OF SO-CALLED

674
00:19:21,191 --> 00:19:22,859
EXPERTS AND A LOT OF SO-CALLED

675
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:24,194
PARENTS THINK THAT THERE'S TOO

676
00:19:24,194 --> 00:19:25,695
MUCH VIOLENCE AND TOO MUCH SEX

677
00:19:25,695 --> 00:19:27,530
IN MUSIC VIDEOS.

678
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,865
WELL, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO

679
00:19:28,865 --> 00:19:30,533
THEM--YOU KNOW, IF I COULD SAY

680
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:31,201
TO THEM.

681
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:32,202
THEY'RE NOT HERE, BUT I'M SAYING

682
00:19:32,202 --> 00:19:33,036
TO THEM--IF THEY COULD

683
00:19:33,036 --> 00:19:36,206
HEAR THIS, "NO."

684
00:19:36,206 --> 00:19:37,974
[mumbling indistinctly]

685
00:19:37,974 --> 00:19:39,475
WELL, I AGREE--I AGREE THAT

686
00:19:39,475 --> 00:19:40,810
THERE'S TOO MUCH VIOLENCE IN

687
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,312
VIDEOS, AND GRANTED, THAT WILL

688
00:19:42,312 --> 00:19:43,813
NOT MAKE ME POPULAR WITH A LOT

689
00:19:43,813 --> 00:19:45,315
OF TEENAGERS, BUT I'M NOT

690
00:19:45,315 --> 00:19:46,482
POPULAR WITH THEM NOW,

691
00:19:46,482 --> 00:19:47,483
SO LIKE I CARE OR SOMETHING.

692
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:48,318
YEAH, TAKE A MINUTE

693
00:19:48,318 --> 00:19:49,152
OUT OF MY BUSY DAY

694
00:19:49,152 --> 00:19:51,988
AND MAKE ME CARE--I DON'T.

695
00:19:51,988 --> 00:19:54,490
BUT ANYWAY, AS FAR AS TOO MUCH

696
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,993
SEX IN VIDEOS GOES, I JUST LIKE

697
00:19:56,993 --> 00:19:58,628
TO THINK THAT, WELL--THIS IS MY

698
00:19:58,628 --> 00:19:59,796
OPINION, AND YOU'RE WELCOME TO

699
00:19:59,796 --> 00:20:01,631
SHARE IT--THAT I THINK THERE'S

700
00:20:01,631 --> 00:20:03,466
NO SUCH THING AS TOO MUCH SEX.

701
00:20:03,466 --> 00:20:05,134
[chuckles]

702
00:20:05,134 --> 00:20:06,803
THERE'S A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE

703
00:20:06,803 --> 00:20:08,638
THING CALLED TOO LITTLE SEX.

704
00:20:08,638 --> 00:20:09,973
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

705
00:20:09,973 --> 00:20:11,975
IT'S HORRIBLE.

706
00:20:11,975 --> 00:20:13,810
BUT MUSIC IS, LIKE, ALL ABOUT

707
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,478
LOVE AND ROMANCE, RIGHT?

708
00:20:15,478 --> 00:20:16,846
AND, WELL, LOVE AND ROMANCE IS

709
00:20:16,846 --> 00:20:18,681
ALL LEADING UP TO SEX, RIGHT?

710
00:20:18,681 --> 00:20:19,682
AND NOBODY OBJECTS WHEN THEY

711
00:20:19,682 --> 00:20:21,517
PLAY THE SONG DON'T SIT UNDER

712
00:20:21,517 --> 00:20:23,519
THE APPLE TREE.

713
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:25,188
WELL, I OBJECT.

714
00:20:25,188 --> 00:20:27,857
IT'S A STUPID SONG.

715
00:20:27,857 --> 00:20:29,992
I LIKE THE MESSAGE, THOUGH.

716
00:20:32,028 --> 00:20:33,029
>> I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN THE STORY

717
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:34,364

718
00:20:34,364 --> 00:20:35,364
MAN SEDGEWICK.

719
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:36,532
SO STAY TUNED.

720
00:20:36,532 --> 00:20:37,366
>> YOU CAN SEE WHY IT'S SO HARD

721
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:38,201
FOR ME TO MAKE THIS SHOW

722
00:20:38,201 --> 00:20:40,169
ENTERTAINING.

723
00:20:49,212 --> 00:20:49,912
>> DAVE, WHY DON'T WE TRY

724
00:20:49,912 --> 00:20:50,747
HITTING THE BALL?

725
00:20:50,747 --> 00:20:52,748
I GOT A BAT HERE, AND WOULD YOU

726
00:20:52,748 --> 00:20:54,417
LIKE TO--WOULD YOU LIKE TO HIT,

727
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:55,084
OR WOULD YOU LIKE

728
00:20:55,084 --> 00:20:55,918
TO PITCH ON THAT?

729
00:20:55,918 --> 00:20:57,086
>> COULD I HIT?

730
00:20:57,086 --> 00:20:58,588
>> NO, WHAT I'M SAYING IS,

731
00:20:58,588 --> 00:20:59,755
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HIT THE BALL,

732
00:20:59,755 --> 00:21:00,923
OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO PITCH?

733
00:21:00,923 --> 00:21:01,924
>> HIT THE BALL.

734
00:21:01,924 --> 00:21:02,925
>> HAVE YOU EVER TRIED PITCHING?

735
00:21:02,925 --> 00:21:04,093
IT'S A LOT OF FUN.

736
00:21:04,093 --> 00:21:04,994
>> IT ISN'T.

737
00:21:04,994 --> 00:21:06,095
>> YEAH, I THINK IT IS.

738
00:21:06,095 --> 00:21:06,929
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE'LL DO.

739
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:08,598
YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T WE FLIP

740
00:21:08,598 --> 00:21:10,600
A COIN?

741
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,101
AND THEN HOWEVER THAT GOES,

742
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:13,436
WE'LL DECIDE WHO HITS AND WHO

743
00:21:13,436 --> 00:21:14,604
PITCHES, OKAY?

744
00:21:14,604 --> 00:21:16,772
SO YOU CALL IT IN THE AIR, OKAY?

745
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:17,440
>> HEADS.

746
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,274
>> NO.

747
00:21:18,274 --> 00:21:19,942
ALL RIGHT, SO, YOU KNOW,

748
00:21:19,942 --> 00:21:21,611
IT'S KIND OF A LESSON IN LIFE,

749
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:22,612
I THINK, FOR THE YOUNGSTERS

750
00:21:22,612 --> 00:21:23,613
TO JUST SEE THAT THINGS

751
00:21:23,613 --> 00:21:24,680
DON'T ALWAYS GO THE WAY

752
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,349
YOU WANT THEM TO GO.

753
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:28,184
GIVE AND TAKE.

754
00:21:28,184 --> 00:21:29,518
BACK UP A BIT, DAVE.

755
00:21:29,518 --> 00:21:30,853
I'M GONNA PITCH TO MYSELF NOW

756
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:32,188
BECAUSE OTHERWISE, HE'S NEVER

757
00:21:32,188 --> 00:21:34,190
GONNA GIVE ME ANYTHING TO HIT.

758
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,691
ALL RIGHT, DAVE, ARE YOU READY?

759
00:21:35,691 --> 00:21:37,026
NOW GET UNDER IT.

760
00:21:37,026 --> 00:21:37,727
WHERE'S YOUR HELMET?

761
00:21:37,727 --> 00:21:38,895
OH, NEVER MIND.

762
00:21:38,895 --> 00:21:40,062
OKAY, HERE WE GO, JUST A NICE

763
00:21:40,062 --> 00:21:43,899
SOFT ONE.

764
00:21:43,899 --> 00:21:46,402
HEY, COME AND GET THAT, DAVE?

765
00:21:46,402 --> 00:21:48,738
THE THING IS HERE THAT, WITH

766
00:21:48,738 --> 00:21:49,905
THE KID, THEY GOT THE ENERGY.

767
00:21:49,905 --> 00:21:50,740
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO

768
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,540
WITH IT.

769
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,209
I SAY TO THEM, "COME ON OUT

770
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:54,710
AND PLAY WITH ME, AND THEN YOUR

771
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,878
ENERGY WILL GET USED.

772
00:21:55,878 --> 00:21:56,712
PLAY WITH ME."

773
00:21:56,712 --> 00:21:59,215
OKAY, DAVE, YOU ALL SET?

774
00:21:59,215 --> 00:22:00,549
>> YEP.

775
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:04,220
>> YOU LOOK KIND OF TIRED.

776
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,555
ALL RIGHT.

777
00:22:06,555 --> 00:22:08,224
NOW, SEE, THE THING IS THAT--

778
00:22:08,224 --> 00:22:09,058
GONNA GET SOME--

779
00:22:09,058 --> 00:22:10,059
THEY GET SOME FRESH AIR.

780
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:11,060
THEY GET SOME EXERCISE.

781
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,228
THEIR LEGS ARE GETTING

782
00:22:12,228 --> 00:22:13,729
MOVED AROUND.

783
00:22:13,729 --> 00:22:15,564
MIND YOU, YOU KNOW, I'M GETTING

784
00:22:15,564 --> 00:22:17,566
KIND OF OLD FOR THIS, BUT,

785
00:22:17,566 --> 00:22:18,734
ANYWAY, I GET TO SPEND SOME TIME

786
00:22:18,734 --> 00:22:19,568
WITH THE YOUNG FELLOW,

787
00:22:19,568 --> 00:22:21,904
AND HE GETS TO LEARN WHAT

788
00:22:21,904 --> 00:22:24,040
GROWING UP IS ALL ABOUT.

789
00:22:29,178 --> 00:22:31,514
SO ANYWAY, STINKY PETERSON KEPT

790
00:22:31,514 --> 00:22:32,848
PLAYING PRACTICAL JOKES ON OLD

791
00:22:32,848 --> 00:22:34,316
MAN SEDGEWICK THE WHOLE EVENING,

792
00:22:34,316 --> 00:22:35,184
BUT, YOU KNOW, THE OLD GUY NEVER

793
00:22:35,184 --> 00:22:36,352
GOT RILED.

794
00:22:36,352 --> 00:22:37,686
I MEAN, EVEN AFTER DINNER THERE,

795
00:22:37,686 --> 00:22:38,854
WHERE HE WAS SCRAPING THE

796
00:22:38,854 --> 00:22:41,190
SHAVING CREAM OFF OF HIS PIE,

797
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,324
HE SAID TO STINKY, "YOU KNOW,

798
00:22:42,324 --> 00:22:43,659
STINKY, IF YOU WANT TO GROW OLD

799
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:45,327
GRACEFULLY, YOU GOT TO FIND

800
00:22:45,327 --> 00:22:46,829
A WAY TO JUST ACCEPT LIFE AND

801
00:22:46,829 --> 00:22:48,164
NOT GET UPSET ABOUT PRANKS,

802
00:22:48,164 --> 00:22:49,431
YOU KNOW."

803
00:22:49,431 --> 00:22:50,599
AND STINKY WAS STILL MULLING

804
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:52,101
THAT OVER WHEN HE WENT TO BED

805
00:22:52,101 --> 00:22:53,435
AND THEN FOUND OUT THAT

806
00:22:53,435 --> 00:22:54,603
HIS SHEETS AND HIS MATTRESS

807
00:22:54,603 --> 00:22:56,105
HAD BEEN FRENCHED, BUT HE DIDN'T

808
00:22:56,105 --> 00:22:57,439
REALLY NOTICE THAT BECAUSE HIS

809
00:22:57,439 --> 00:22:58,774
PAJAMAS WERE SO FULL OF ITCHING

810
00:22:58,774 --> 00:22:59,775
POWDER, YOU KNOW, AND THEN,

811
00:22:59,775 --> 00:23:00,776
OF COURSE, THE BED COLLAPSED,

812
00:23:00,776 --> 00:23:01,644
AND HE WENT RIGHT DOWN THROUGH

813
00:23:01,644 --> 00:23:03,312
THE CUTAWAY FLOORBOARDS, BOUNCED

814
00:23:03,312 --> 00:23:04,647
OFF THE NAUGAHYDE RECLINER

815
00:23:04,647 --> 00:23:05,581
OUT THROUGH THE FRONT WINDOW AND

816
00:23:05,581 --> 00:23:07,917
HEADFIRST INTO THE SEPTIC TANK.

817
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:09,084
AND OLD MAN SEDGEWICK YELLED

818
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:10,352
DOWN THROUGH THE SEPTIC TANK,

819
00:23:10,352 --> 00:23:13,522
"OH, YEAH, REVENGE IS GOOD TOO."

820
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:14,690
YEAH, LIVE AND LEARN.

821
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,692
AND THE DOCTORS SAY HE WILL.

822
00:23:16,692 --> 00:23:18,027
ANYWAY, UH, IF MY WIFE IS

823
00:23:18,027 --> 00:23:18,861
WATCHING, I'LL BE COMING

824

00:23:19,862 --> 00:23:20,863

TONIGHT.

827
00:23:21,697 --> 00:23:23,699
UH, I DO THIS A FEW TIMES

828
00:23:23,699 --> 00:23:24,700
A YEAR, BECAUSE I'M REALLY NOT

829
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,701
TOO SURE WHEN OUR ANNIVERSARY

830
00:23:25,701 --> 00:23:26,869
IS, AND THIS WAY, EVERYBODY

831
00:23:26,869 --> 00:23:28,370
WINS.

832
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,538
SO THANKS FOR WATCHING THE SHOW,

833
00:23:29,538 --> 00:23:30,739

839
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:45,220
