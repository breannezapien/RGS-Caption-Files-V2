A ROW, BUT I GUESS THAT'S WHAT

10
00:00:51,784 --> 00:00:52,986
MAKES ME A PROFESSIONAL, AS THEY

11
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:54,487
SAY IN THE BUSINESS.

RELATIONSHIP WITH MY DAD.

THOUGH IT'S ACTUALLY ONLY 30

18
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:04,264
MINUTES INCLUDING COMMERCIALS

19
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,164
AND SUCH.

20
00:01:05,164 --> 00:01:09,302

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,118
RELATIONSHIP WITH MY BROTHER.

30
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,419
COME ON OVER HERE, HAROLD.

31
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,320

32
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,087
PRODUCER AND DIRECTOR.

00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:29,822
DON'T LET THIS FANCY GIZMO RIG

HANGING AROUND HAROLD'S NECK

35
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:31,791
FOOL YOU.

36
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,026
IT'S SOME SORT OF A SPECIAL

37
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,260
EFFECTS MACHINE THAT HE USES

38
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,728
TO DO KIND OF BAD THINGS TO

39
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:38,998
THE SHOW, REALLY.

40
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:39,866
>> THAT'S TRUE.

42
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,435
PERSONAL HARDWARE, I CAN CONTROL

00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,703
THE SPEED THE OF THE SHOW.

44
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:44,937
I CAN TAKE US TO DIFFERENT

45
00:01:44,937 --> 00:01:46,339
SEGMENTS IF IT STARTS DRAGGING

46
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:47,073
OR SOMETHING.

47
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:48,374
YOU KNOW, THAT CAN HAPPEN.

48
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:49,275
>> JUST AS LONG AS I GET A

49
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,209
LITTLE WARNING, RIGHT?

50
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:51,344
>> OH, NO PROBLEM, BIG GUY.

51
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,579
[laughs]

52
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:54,647
UNCLE RED.

53
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:55,314
SORRY.

54
00:01:55,314 --> 00:01:56,549
>> ALL RIGHT, SO ANYWAY.

55
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,217
GOT TALKING UP AT THE LODGE THIS

56
00:01:58,217 --> 00:01:58,885
WEEK.

57
00:01:58,885 --> 00:01:59,685
THERE'S SOME NEW THING ON THE

58
00:01:59,685 --> 00:02:00,353
MARKET.

59
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:01,254
IT'S CALLED A JET SKI, WHO I

60
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,922
THOUGHT PLAYED FOR LOS ANGELES.

61
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:04,190
BUT APPARENTLY THIS IS SOME

62
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,426
OTHER TYPE OF A JET SKI THAT

63
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,194
GOES ON TOP OF THE WATER, WHICH

64
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:09,228
NOBODY HAS DONE THAT I KNOW OF

65
00:02:09,228 --> 00:02:10,229
IN THE LAST COUPLE OF THOUSAND

66
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,197
YEARS.

67
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,598
SO THE BUNCH OF US AT THE LODGE

68
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:13,833
DECIDED TO GO DOWN TO THE MARINA

69
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,802
AND CHECK IT OUT.

70
00:02:19,238 --> 00:02:21,240
WHAT KIND OF A WARNING WAS THAT?

71
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,208
>> WELL, YOU SAW MY HANDS MOVE

72
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,110
TO THE CONTROL.

73
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,513
WELL?

74
00:02:27,513 --> 00:02:28,781
>>  LISTEN TO THE WORDS

75
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:31,050
OF THIS VERY SPECIAL SONG

76
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:31,951
DA, DA, DA, DA

00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:32,852

00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,192
THEN YOU CAN SING ALONG

82
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,059

DA, DA, DA, DA, DA

00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:45,131
PLAY CLOSE ATTENTION

87
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,032
IT'S NOT AS EASY

88
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:47,366
AS IT SOUNDS

89
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:48,367
DA, DA, DA, DA

INCREMENTAL

93
00:02:51,737 --> 00:02:52,538
DA, DA, DA, DA

94
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:53,472
THERMONUCLEAR

95
00:02:53,472 --> 00:02:54,540
QUANTUM PHYSICS

96
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,009
DA, DA, DA, DA

00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:58,544
>> EIGHT MORE TIMES.

98
00:02:58,544 --> 00:02:59,478
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

99
00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:01,447
>> ALL RIGHT.

100
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,887
>> NOW, THIS WEEK ON HANDYMAN

101
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:09,689
CORNER, WE'RE GONNA SHOW YOU HOW

102
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,824
TO USE DIFFERENT TOOLS FOR

103
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:13,392
DIFFERENT JOBS.

104
00:03:13,392 --> 00:03:15,094
AND WHEN I SAY THAT, WHAT I MEAN

105
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,330
IS NOT NECESSARILY A DIFFERENT

106
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,497
TOOL AND A JOB.

107
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:19,799
I MEAN A TOOL THAT'S MAYBE USED

108
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,567
IN A DIFFERENT JOB, BUT MAYBE ON

109
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:23,436
A DIFFERENT TOOL WITH THE--

110
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:24,136
WITH THE JOB.

111
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:25,738
IT'S MAYBE A DIFFERENT JOB

112
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:28,474
INVOLVED WITH THE TOOL.

113
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:29,375
WELL, I HOPE THAT CLEARS

114
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,109
THAT UP.

115
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,677
SO LETS SAY, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU

116
00:03:31,677 --> 00:03:33,946
HAVE A BUNCH OF NAILS THAT YOU

117
00:03:33,946 --> 00:03:35,881
WANT TO HAMMER IN, BUT FOR SOME

118
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:36,849
REASON OR OTHER, YOUR HAMMER IS

119
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:39,051
OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF A LAKE,

120
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:40,453
THROUGH THE RESULT OF SOME SORT

121
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:42,588
OF A DOMESTIC SQUABBLE.

122
00:03:42,588 --> 00:03:43,956
SO INSTEAD OF A HAMMER, WHAT YOU

123
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:45,224
USE IS A SUBSTITUTE HAMMER,

124
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:46,258
SOMETHING LIKE, SAY, A PIPE

125
00:03:46,258 --> 00:03:48,060
WRENCH.

126
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,728
WORKS GOOD.

127
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,895
OR MAYBE YOU CAN'T USE A PIPE

128
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:51,564
WRENCH BECAUSE IT'S IN YOUR CAR

129
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,999
HOLDING THE RADIATOR ON.

130
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:56,902
YOU MIGHT TAKE A LOOK AT USING

131
00:03:56,902 --> 00:03:58,204
AN AX OR A HATCHET, SOMETHING

132
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,805
THAT HAS A FLAT BOTTOM.

133
00:03:59,805 --> 00:04:01,540
BUT THE THING HERE IS, I REALLY

134
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,943
WOULD BE CAREFUL ON THE UPSWING.

135
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:04,877
I'M NOT SURE YOU'RE THE KIND OF

136
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:05,811
THE PERSON THAT WANTS THE

137
00:04:05,811 --> 00:04:07,012
CREASES IN YOUR FOREHEAD TO RUN

138
00:04:07,012 --> 00:04:09,415
UP AND DOWN.

139
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,684
ANOTHER SUBSTITUTE HAMMER IS A

140
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:12,551
FLASHLIGHT.

141
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:13,719
NOT EVERYBODY THINKS OF THIS,

142
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,753
BUT IF YOU GET ONE OF THESE,

143
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:16,188
WHICH HOLDS THREE OR FOUR

144
00:04:16,188 --> 00:04:17,323
BATTERIES, IT'S GOT SOME WEIGHT

145
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:18,157
TO IT.

146
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:19,225
AND THE BEAUTY, OF COURSE, OF

147
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,192
THIS IS YOU CAN DO IT AT NIGHT

148
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:22,094
WITH THE POWER OFF, AND HOW MANY

149
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:24,096
THINGS CAN YOU SAY THAT ABOUT?

150
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:25,498
SO WHAT YOU DO IS, YOU SHINE THE

151
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:27,900
FLASHLIGHT ON THE NAIL AND THEN.

152
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,003
YOU MIGHT WANT TO GO A LITTLE

153
00:04:31,003 --> 00:04:34,139
EASY FOR A WHILE WITH THAT ONE.

154
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:35,841
ONE OF MY FAVORITE SUBSTITUTE

155
00:04:35,841 --> 00:04:37,243
HAMMERS IS, OF COURSE, THE

156
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:38,711
LEVEL, BECAUSE WHAT YOU CAN DO

157
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,446
IS, YOU CAN LEVEL UP THE WOOD,

158
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,280
MAKE SURE IT'S RIGHT WHERE YOU

159
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,448
WANT IT, AND THEN PUT IT IN

160
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,817
PLACE WITH THE SAME TOOL, LIKE

161
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,151
THAT.

162
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:47,286
YOU CAN TAKE THE SAME APPROACH

163
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:50,356
WITH SCREWING.

164
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:53,525
YOU DON'T HAVE A SCREWDRIVER?

165
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:54,526
I CAN GET YOU A SCREWDRIVER FOR

166
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:55,461
TEN CENTS.

167
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,862
IT'S A DIME.

168
00:04:56,862 --> 00:04:59,632
FITS IN THE SLOT, AND IF YOU'RE

169
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,899
NOT REAL FOND OF THE SKIN ON

170
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:01,934
YOUR FINGERS, THIS CAN BE A

171
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,002
DANDY LITTLE TOOL.

172

196

AN ENCHANTED CLYDESDALE

342
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:39,577
NAMED GARTH

343
00:09:39,577 --> 00:09:40,745
HE FROLICKED

344
00:09:40,745 --> 00:09:42,447
IN THE AUTUMN MIST

345
00:09:42,447 --> 00:09:46,484
IN A LAND CALLED SIMCOE

346
00:09:46,484 --> 00:09:48,720
HE HAD THREE WISHES

347
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,487
AND HE LEFT ON THEM

348
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:51,823
ON THE ROAD

349
00:09:51,823 --> 00:09:53,124
I STEPPED IN ONE

350
00:09:53,124 --> 00:09:53,925
BELIEVE ME

351
00:09:53,925 --> 00:09:54,926
IT'S NOT ALWAYS GOOD

352
00:09:54,926 --> 00:09:57,695
WHEN YOUR WISHES COME TRUE

353
00:09:57,695 --> 00:09:58,763
THANK YOU.

354
00:09:58,763 --> 00:10:00,298
LIKE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OTHER

355
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:01,566
SUBSTITUTE TOOLS NOW.

356
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:03,334
LET'S SAY YOU GOT A PIECE OF

357
00:10:03,334 --> 00:10:04,135
WOOD LIKE THIS.

358
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:04,969
YOU WANT TO DO SOME SORT OF A

359
00:10:04,969 --> 00:10:08,173
FANCY DADO CUT IN IT BUT YOUR

360
00:10:08,173 --> 00:10:09,941
CHISEL IS ALL BUNGED UP BECAUSE

361
00:10:09,941 --> 00:10:10,642
SOMEBODY USED IT AS A

362
00:10:10,642 --> 00:10:12,177
SCREWDRIVER.

363
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:13,545
WHAT YOU DO IS TIT FOR TAT, AS

364
00:10:13,545 --> 00:10:15,413
WE SAY, PUT THE SCREWDRIVER AND

365
00:10:15,413 --> 00:10:17,182
USE YOUR SCREWDRIVER AS A

366
00:10:17,182 --> 00:10:21,586
CHISEL.

367
00:10:21,586 --> 00:10:24,956
THEN JUST TAKE IT OUT AND GO...

368
00:10:24,956 --> 00:10:25,890
ALL RIGHT, WELL, WE'LL GET BACK

369
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,792
TO THAT LATER.

370
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:30,228
ALL RIGHT, FOR EXAMPLE, YOUR

371
00:10:30,228 --> 00:10:32,263
LEVEL IS NOT WORKING TOO WELL

372
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:33,464
ANYMORE BECAUSE SOMEONE USED IT,

373
00:10:33,464 --> 00:10:35,633
SAY, AS A HAMMER, SAY, WHAT YOU

374
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:37,101
CAN USE IS A PENCIL CRAYON.

375
00:10:37,101 --> 00:10:37,969
YOU PUT IT ON THE--ON THE

376
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:39,037
TABLE.

377
00:10:39,037 --> 00:10:40,471
STOPS ROLLING,

378
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:42,540
THAT'S LEVEL.

379
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,409
ANOTHER SUBSTITUTE TOOL, LET'S

380
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:45,576
SAY YOU WANT TO--YOU WANT TO

381
00:10:45,576 --> 00:10:46,844
CUT A PIECE OF WOOD, AND YOUR

382
00:10:46,844 --> 00:10:49,447
SAW IS WHO KNOWS WHERE?

383
00:10:49,447 --> 00:10:50,381
STUCK IN SOMEONE'S TIRE,

384
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:52,684
PERHAPS.

385
00:10:52,684 --> 00:10:54,886
TAKE AN X-ACTO KNIFE.

386
00:10:54,886 --> 00:10:57,555
SCORE THE WOOD ON BOTH SIDES.

387
00:10:57,555 --> 00:10:58,423
HERE AGAIN, I SHOULD CAUTION

388
00:10:58,423 --> 00:10:59,090
YOU.

389
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,591
NEVER HOLD WOOD BETWEEN YOUR

390
00:11:00,591 --> 00:11:02,160
KNEES WHILE YOU'RE CUTTING IT

391
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,195
WITH AN X-ACTO KNIFE UNLESS

392
00:11:04,195 --> 00:11:05,596
YOUR FAVORITE SONG IS THE FIRST

393
00:11:05,596 --> 00:11:08,633
CUT IS THE DEEPEST.

394
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:09,667
OKAY, YOU GOT HER SCORED

395
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:11,602
ON BOTH SIDES.

396
00:11:11,602 --> 00:11:13,838
PROP HER UP AGAINST--AGAINST

397
00:11:13,838 --> 00:11:14,839
THE SIDE OF YOUR WORK BENCH

398
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:18,176
OR YOUR WIFE'S CAR, AND GET

399
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:20,144
WHAT I CALL THE SUBSTITUTE SAW.

400
00:11:20,144 --> 00:11:22,113
THE SLEDGEHAMMER.

401
00:11:25,216 --> 00:11:28,086
ALL RIGHT, NOW, IT DOES GIVE A

402
00:11:28,086 --> 00:11:29,987
BIT OF A--A BIT OF A ROUGH

403
00:11:29,987 --> 00:11:32,356
FINISH, BUT I THINK A LITTLE

404
00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:34,992
SANDPAPER ON THAT, AND IT'LL

405
00:11:34,992 --> 00:11:35,660
COME OUT NICE.

406
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,828
AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE SANDPAPER,

407
00:11:36,828 --> 00:11:40,098
OF COURSE, YOU CAN USE A BRICK.

408
00:11:40,098 --> 00:11:41,732
A BRICK ALSO WILL SUBSTITUTE AS

409
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:43,301
A HAMMER, AND IF YOU HAVE 50

410
00:11:43,301 --> 00:11:45,369
BRICKS, YOU CAN MAKE A VISE.

411
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:47,538
JUST REMEMBER THAT A HANDYMAN

412
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:48,573
NEVER BLAMES HIS TOOLS.

413
00:11:48,573 --> 00:11:50,408
HE JUST GRABS SOMETHING ELSE.

414
00:11:50,408 --> 00:11:51,909
SO, UNTIL NEXT TIME, KEEP THIS

415
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:52,643
IN MIND.

416
00:11:52,643 --> 00:11:53,478
IF THE WOMEN DON'T FIND YOU

417
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:54,745
HANDSOME, THEY SHOULD AT LEAST

418
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:58,249
FIND YOU HANDY.

419
00:11:58,249 --> 00:11:59,083
>> WELL, EXCELLENT TIMING,

420
00:11:59,083 --> 00:11:59,817
UNCLE RED.

421
00:11:59,817 --> 00:12:00,985
IT'S TIME FOR MALE CALL.

422
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:02,286
TIME TO ANSWER SOME LETTERS.

423
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:04,088
TIME TO TIE ON THE OLD FEED BAG,

424
00:12:04,088 --> 00:12:05,089
IF YOU WILL.

425
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:05,756
[laughs]

426
00:12:05,756 --> 00:12:06,457
YOU WANT TO READ THE FIRST

427
00:12:06,457 --> 00:12:07,225
LETTER OR YOU WANT ME TO READ

428
00:12:07,225 --> 00:12:07,892
IT?

429
00:12:07,892 --> 00:12:08,593
THAT WAY, WE CAN JUST KEEP

430
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:09,493
THINGS CLIPPING ALONG.

431
00:12:09,493 --> 00:12:10,194
>> YEAH, THAT'LL BE FINE,

432
00:12:10,194 --> 00:12:10,928
HAROLD.

433
00:12:10,928 --> 00:12:12,163
DON'T GET ALL EXCITED THERE.

434
00:12:12,163 --> 00:12:13,231
>> I'M NOT NEARLY AS EXCITED AS

435
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:14,732
YOU THINK.

436
00:12:14,732 --> 00:12:16,534
>> ALL RIGHT.

437
00:12:16,534 --> 00:12:17,368
>> "DEAR MR. GREEN,

438
00:12:17,368 --> 00:12:18,202
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOUR

439
00:12:18,202 --> 00:12:19,870
SHOW FOR A WHOLE EPISODE NOW,

440
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,771
AND I REALLY THINK IT'S THE

441
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:22,039
GREATEST THING TO HIT TV SINCE

442
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,140
WRESTLEMANIA.

443
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,175
I LIKE WRESTLING.

444
00:12:24,175 --> 00:12:25,910
I USED TO LIKE HOCKEY, BUT NOW I

445
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,178
THINK IT'S TOO VIOLENT.

446
00:12:27,178 --> 00:12:28,746
NOW I LIKE WRESTLING, BUT MY

447
00:12:28,746 --> 00:12:30,314
WIFE SAYS IT'S JUST FAKE.

448
00:12:30,314 --> 00:12:31,115
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

449
00:12:31,115 --> 00:12:32,416
IS WRESTLING FAKE OR WHAT?"

450
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:33,117
[chuckles]

451
00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:34,819
EXCELLENT QUESTION.

452
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:35,753
>> UH, HAROLD, YOU KNOW WE'VE

453
00:12:35,753 --> 00:12:36,921
HAD COMPLAINT BEFORE ABOUT THE

454
00:12:36,921 --> 00:12:38,656
WRESTLING BEING FAKE, AND LET ME

455
00:12:38,656 --> 00:12:39,590
JUST STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT.

456
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,359
WRESTLING IS A SPORT.

457
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:42,293
IT GOES WAY BACK.

458
00:12:42,293 --> 00:12:43,194
IT'S REAL OLD.

459
00:12:43,194 --> 00:12:44,028
IT WAS ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE

460
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:45,296
GREEKS AND THEY'RE REALLY OLD,

461
00:12:45,296 --> 00:12:46,364
YOU KNOW?

462
00:12:46,364 --> 00:12:48,132
IN FACT, THE FIRST OLYMPICS WAS

463
00:12:48,132 --> 00:12:49,633
NOTHING BUT WRESTLING.

464
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:50,701
COURSE, NOW, IN THOSE DAYS, THEY

465
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:51,669
WERE NAKED.

466
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:52,336
>> REALLY?

467
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:53,004
>> OH, YEAH.

468
00:12:53,004 --> 00:12:53,704
BUCK NAKED.

469
00:12:53,704 --> 00:12:55,072
>> [laughs]

470
00:12:55,072 --> 00:12:57,408
YOU CAN'T FAKE THAT.

471
00:12:57,408 --> 00:12:58,342
>> NO, AND IT MADE FOR SOME

472
00:12:58,342 --> 00:12:59,877
EXCELLENT HOLDS.

473
00:12:59,877 --> 00:13:01,145
BUT THEY HAVE EXCELLENT HOLDS

474
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:02,713
NOW TODAY, AND LET ME JUST

475
00:13:02,713 --> 00:13:03,748
ASSURE THIS VIEWER THAT HE IS

476
00:13:03,748 --> 00:13:05,349
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

477
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:06,617
WRESTLING COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE

478
00:13:06,617 --> 00:13:07,518
FAKE.

479
00:13:07,518 --> 00:13:08,252
>> WELL, IN MY OPINION,

480
00:13:08,252 --> 00:13:11,655
WRESTLING IS, LIKE, HUGELY FAKE.

481
00:13:11,655 --> 00:13:12,556
>> WELL, THE VIEWER DIDN'T WRITE

482
00:13:12,556 --> 00:13:13,624
A LETTER TO YOU, NOW DID HE,

483
00:13:13,624 --> 00:13:14,358
HAROLD?

484
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:15,726
>> GOOD POINT.

485
00:13:15,726 --> 00:13:16,394
>> AND HE NEVER WILL.

486
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:17,561
BELIEVE ME.

487
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:18,963
>> WELL, HIS WIFE MIGHT.

488
00:13:18,963 --> 00:13:20,798
[laughs]

489
00:13:20,798 --> 00:13:21,866
I HAVE ANOTHER LETTER HERE,

490
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:22,566
UNCLE RED.

491
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:24,835
SAYS "I REALLY LIKE YOUR TRUCK.

492
00:13:24,835 --> 00:13:26,303
WHERE'D YOU GET IT?"

493
00:13:26,303 --> 00:13:28,472
SIGNED, "WONDERING IN WAWA."

494
00:13:28,472 --> 00:13:29,140
>> WAWA.

495
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,975
THAT'S A GREAT LITTLE TOWN.

496
00:13:30,975 --> 00:13:32,309
THEY HAVE ENORMOUS GOOSE UP

497
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:33,310
THERE, HAROLD.

498
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,879
IF YOU EVER WANT ENORMOUS GOOSE,

499
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:36,580
YOU KNOW YOU CAN GO TO WAWA.

500
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,281
>> YEP.

501
00:13:37,281 --> 00:13:38,249
UNCLE RED, THEY--THEY ASKED

502
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:39,850
ABOUT YOUR TRUCK.

503
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:40,951
>> OH YEAH, WELL, THE TRUCK.

504
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:42,052
THAT'S AN INTERESTING STORY.

505
00:13:42,052 --> 00:13:42,987
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T ACTUALLY BUY

506
00:13:42,987 --> 00:13:44,588
THAT TRUCK.

507
00:13:44,588 --> 00:13:46,423
I TRADED A GUY FOR A 12-POUND

508
00:13:46,423 --> 00:13:48,159
PICKEREL, AND I THOUGHT I GOT A

509
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,426
GOOD DEAL, BUT THEN WHEN I

510
00:13:49,426 --> 00:13:50,794
PULLED INTO THE GARAGE, THE DARN

511
00:13:50,794 --> 00:13:51,996
BRAKES FAILED.

512
00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:52,796
>> YOU GOT BRAKES IN YOUR

513
00:13:52,796 --> 00:13:54,131
GARAGE?

514
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:55,065
>> NO, THE BRAKES IN THE TRUCK,

515
00:13:55,065 --> 00:13:56,467
HAROLD.

516
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:57,368
>> WELL, YOU MISPLACED YOUR

517
00:13:57,368 --> 00:13:59,603
MODIFIER.

518
00:13:59,603 --> 00:14:00,905
>> WELL, I ALWAYS SIT LIKE THIS.

519
00:14:00,905 --> 00:14:02,873
IT'S COMFORTABLE.

520
00:14:02,873 --> 00:14:03,841
>> WELL, IF WE'RE READY TO GO TO

521
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:05,276
THE NEXT SEGMENT, WELL, LET HER

522
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:07,211
ROLL.

523
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:09,213
YOU MADE A GRAMMATICAL ERROR.

524
00:14:09,213 --> 00:14:10,080
>> THAT WASN'T ME, HAROLD.

525
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,049
IT WAS THE CHAIR.

526
00:14:14,084 --> 00:14:16,420
>> [yelling]

527
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,955
[grunts]

528
00:14:17,955 --> 00:14:19,456
>> BILL WAS IN THE AREA, SO I

529
00:14:19,456 --> 00:14:22,393
DECIDED TO SWING BY THE LODGE.

530
00:14:22,393 --> 00:14:23,661
HE HAD A LITTLE SOMETHING

531
00:14:23,661 --> 00:14:26,297
SPECIAL IN HIS PANTS TODAY.

532
00:14:26,297 --> 00:14:27,598
IT WAS SOMETHING, I BELIEVE,

533
00:14:27,598 --> 00:14:29,166
FROM SOUTH AMERICA.

534
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,135
THEY'RE CALLED--

535
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:33,971
WHOA-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA, ALL

536
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:35,205
RIGHT, HE'S ALL RIGHT.

537
00:14:35,205 --> 00:14:37,508
THEY'RE CALLED BOLOS, AND THAT'S

538
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:39,143
LIKE A STONE, SOME TYPE OF A

539
00:14:39,143 --> 00:14:40,611
ROCK, THEY TIE ON A STRING AND

540
00:14:40,611 --> 00:14:41,578
THEY USE THIS ACTUALLY AS A

541
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:42,246
WEAPON.

542
00:14:42,246 --> 00:14:43,514
THEY SWING IT AROUND THERE.

543
00:14:43,514 --> 00:14:44,715
LOOK OUT, BILL. LOOK OUT.

544
00:14:44,715 --> 00:14:46,550
SWING IT AROUND.

545
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,484
I LIKE IT.

546
00:14:47,484 --> 00:14:48,552
IT'S KIND OF--YOU KNOW, IT'S

547
00:14:48,552 --> 00:14:49,887
ALMOST LIKE A BOOMERANG-TYPE

548
00:14:49,887 --> 00:14:50,688
THING.

549
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:51,789
I GOT IT TO GO PRETTY--LOOK

550
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:52,823
OUT, BILL.

551
00:14:52,823 --> 00:14:53,557
LOOK OUT.

552
00:14:53,557 --> 00:14:54,224
OH-OH-OH OW.

553
00:14:54,224 --> 00:14:56,760
>> AHH!

554
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,262
>> WELL, IT TAKES A LITTLE

555
00:14:58,262 --> 00:14:59,196
GETTING USED TO.

556
00:14:59,196 --> 00:15:00,297
BILL WAS--I GUESS, WAS SHOWING

557
00:15:00,297 --> 00:15:01,832
ME SOME OF THE THINGS THAT CAN

558
00:15:01,832 --> 00:15:04,068
GO WRONG WITH THEM.

559
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:05,669
HE GOT IT ALL CLEAR AND WENT

560
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:06,537
THIS WAY WITH IT.

561
00:15:06,537 --> 00:15:07,504
A LITTLE DIFFERENT APPROACH, YOU

562
00:15:07,504 --> 00:15:08,639
KNOW, THE VERTICAL RATHER THAN

563
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,507
THE HORIZONTAL THROW, AND WE

564
00:15:10,507 --> 00:15:11,642
SUDDENLY REALIZED THAT THE

565
00:15:11,642 --> 00:15:14,845
STONES HAD COME RIGHT OFF.

566
00:15:14,845 --> 00:15:15,813
COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY--

567
00:15:15,813 --> 00:15:17,848
THEN I HEARD, AND THEN--

568
00:15:17,848 --> 00:15:18,715
BILL, LOOK OUT. WE GOT TO--

569
00:15:18,715 --> 00:15:19,383
BILL, WE GOT TO GO.

570
00:15:19,383 --> 00:15:20,050
WE GOT TO--

571
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:20,951
BILL, BILL, GOT TO GO

572
00:15:20,951 --> 00:15:21,952
GOT TO GO.

573
00:15:21,952 --> 00:15:23,287
GO.

574
00:15:23,287 --> 00:15:23,954
OKAY.

575
00:15:23,954 --> 00:15:25,255
NOW BILL DECIDED TO SET UP A

576
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:26,990
LITTLE TARGET WITH SOME GLASS.

577
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,393
>> [groans]

578
00:15:29,393 --> 00:15:30,627
>> AND THEN HE DECIDED TO SET IT

579
00:15:30,627 --> 00:15:33,797
UP AGAIN, AND I WAS GONNA

580
00:15:33,797 --> 00:15:35,732
TAKE--TAKE THE FIRST SHOT AND

581
00:15:35,732 --> 00:15:38,969
SEE IF I COULD SWING OUT AND HIT

582
00:15:38,969 --> 00:15:40,604
THE--HIT THE JARS OR WHATEVER.

583
00:15:40,604 --> 00:15:42,005
AND I TRIED A LITTLE DIFFERENT

584
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:42,673
APPROACH.

585
00:15:42,673 --> 00:15:45,042
I TRIED THE BOUNCE TECHNIQUE,

586
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:46,410
AND IT WORKED REAL GOOD, I

587
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,377
THOUGHT.

588
00:15:47,377 --> 00:15:49,947
AND NOW BILL'S TURN.

589
00:15:49,947 --> 00:15:51,715
BILL HAD A LITTLE BIT OF,

590
00:15:51,715 --> 00:15:52,683
YOU KNOW, CONTROL--

591
00:15:52,683 --> 00:15:56,920
OH, THANK YOU, BILL.

592
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,323
TRY HER AGAIN.

593
00:15:59,323 --> 00:16:00,524
IT'S CLOSE. IT'S CLOSE.

594
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:02,392
I SHOULD HAVE SKIPPED IT AGAIN.

595
00:16:02,392 --> 00:16:03,760
BILL, I THINK HE HAS A TROUBLE

596
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,229
KNOWING, YOU KNOW, WHAT

597
00:16:05,229 --> 00:16:07,431
DIRECTION--OH, OH, THAT WAS

598
00:16:07,431 --> 00:16:08,365
OUR BACKHOE.

599
00:16:08,365 --> 00:16:12,836
OH-OH-OH-OH, BOY.

600
00:16:12,836 --> 00:16:14,538
OH, THE CAMERAMAN WAS OKAY.

601
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:16,273
SO BILL TRIED THIS, AND HE GOT

602
00:16:16,273 --> 00:16:18,308
SOME SORT OF A STRANGE THING

603
00:16:18,308 --> 00:16:18,976
GOING ON.

604
00:16:18,976 --> 00:16:19,910
HE STARTED TO RISE UP LIKE A--

605
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,011
ALMOST LIKE A HELICOPTER, I

606
00:16:21,011 --> 00:16:22,946
GUESS, BUT THE THING'S SPINNING

607
00:16:22,946 --> 00:16:23,614
AROUND.

608
00:16:23,614 --> 00:16:24,414
I COULDN'T BELIEVE--HARDLY

609
00:16:24,414 --> 00:16:25,549
BELIEVE THIS WAS HAPPENING, BUT

610
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:26,883
I WAS THERE, AND IT MUST HAVE

611
00:16:26,883 --> 00:16:28,418
BEEN HAPPENING, AND I WAS THERE.

612
00:16:28,418 --> 00:16:30,320
AND HE WAS GOING WAY, WAY UP

613
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,121
THERE.

614
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:32,289
GEE, I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT, YOU

615
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:34,458
KNOW, AND HE WAS ENJOYING IT,

616
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,125
THOUGH.

617
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,026
HE WAS ENJOYING IT,

618
00:16:36,026 --> 00:16:37,260
HAVING A GOOD TIME.

619
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,128
SO, YOU KNOW, I PROBABLY

620
00:16:38,128 --> 00:16:39,096
SHOULDN'T HAVE WAVED AT HIM,

621
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:40,998
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE HAD TO

622
00:16:40,998 --> 00:16:42,833
WAVE BACK AND THEN THAT WASN'T

623
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:43,900
SO SMART.

624
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,970
>> [yelling]

625
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,940
[groaning]

626
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,342
>> AND THEN I COULD HEAR THE

627
00:16:52,342 --> 00:16:53,610
BOLOS COMING DOWN.

628
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,713
BILL. BILL. BILL. BILL. BILL.

629
00:16:56,713 --> 00:16:58,715
OH, BOY.

630
00:16:58,715 --> 00:17:00,450
BUT I REALLY DID ENJOY WORKING

631
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,385
WITH THE BOLOS, AND I TOOK THEM

632
00:17:02,385 --> 00:17:03,053
WITH ME.

633
00:17:03,053 --> 00:17:03,887
I MIGHT PLAY WITH SOME ANOTHER

634
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:07,090
DAY.

635
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,259
IT IS WINTER.

636
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:10,827
THE FUN OF THROWING SNOWBALLS AT

637
00:17:10,827 --> 00:17:12,229
OLD PEOPLE.

638
00:17:12,229 --> 00:17:14,064
THE JOY OF WRITING YOUR NAME IN

639
00:17:14,064 --> 00:17:16,766
A SNOWBANK IN YELLOW.

640
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:19,469
MORE DANGEROUS FROM THE ICE, YET

641
00:17:19,469 --> 00:17:20,570
SAFER 'CAUSE YOU CAN SEE

642
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:21,972
EVERYONE'S BREATH AND AVOID

643
00:17:21,972 --> 00:17:23,940
WALKING INTO IT.

>> YEAH.

646
00:17:34,217 --> 00:17:35,252
>> WHAT WAS IT LIKE WHEN YOU

647
00:17:35,252 --> 00:17:36,586
WERE MY AGE?

648
00:17:36,586 --> 00:17:39,789
>> MENTALLY OR PHYSICALLY?

649
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:41,191
>> I DON'T GET THAT.

650
00:17:41,191 --> 00:17:43,059
>> OKAY, SO PHYSICALLY.

651
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:45,128
WELL, IT WAS DIFFERENT, YOU

652
00:17:45,128 --> 00:17:45,795
KNOW.

653
00:17:45,795 --> 00:17:46,596
I MEAN, WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER,

654
00:17:46,596 --> 00:17:49,065
MY AFTERSCHOOL JOB WAS PIN BOY.

655
00:17:49,065 --> 00:17:49,866
>> WOW!

656
00:17:49,866 --> 00:17:51,001
REALLY?

657
00:17:51,001 --> 00:17:51,935
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

658
00:17:51,935 --> 00:17:52,969
PIN BOY.

659
00:17:52,969 --> 00:17:53,637
WHAT WAS THAT?

660
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:55,472
LIKE A SUPERHERO OR SOMETHING?

661
00:17:55,472 --> 00:17:56,773
>> NO, HAROLD, I WAS--I WAS A

662
00:17:56,773 --> 00:17:57,841
PIN BOY IN A BOWLING ALLEY.

663
00:17:57,841 --> 00:17:58,742
>> OH.

664
00:17:58,742 --> 00:18:00,410
>> YEAH, I HAD TO WORK SIX HOURS

665
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,379
JUST TO EARN ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY

666
00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:03,613
MYSELF A SODA AND A BAG OF

667
00:18:03,613 --> 00:18:05,115
CHIPS.

668
00:18:05,115 --> 00:18:06,616
>> WHAT FLAVOR?

669
00:18:06,616 --> 00:18:07,851
>> USUALLY AN ORANGE SODA.

670
00:18:07,851 --> 00:18:09,819
>> NO, NO, NO, UNCLE RED.

671

WHAT FLAVOR CHIPS?

00:18:11,621 --> 00:18:12,555
>> WELL, WE DIDN'T HAVE FLAVORED

673
00:18:12,555 --> 00:18:13,223
CHIPS.

674
00:18:13,223 --> 00:18:15,325
JUST PLAIN CHIPS.

675
00:18:15,325 --> 00:18:16,760
>> WHAT?

676
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,130
YOU DIDN'T HAVE FLAVORED CHIPS?

677
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,198
YOUR LIFE MUST HAVE BEEN SAD.

678
00:18:22,198 --> 00:18:23,466
I MEAN, YOU DIDN'T HAVE, LIKE--

679
00:18:23,466 --> 00:18:24,868
YOU DIDN'T HAVE KETCHUP

680
00:18:24,868 --> 00:18:26,636
OR SOUR CREAM AND ONION, DILL

681
00:18:26,636 --> 00:18:29,572
PICKLE, SALT AND VINEGAR, RANCHO

682
00:18:29,572 --> 00:18:30,974
COOL?

683
00:18:30,974 --> 00:18:32,976
LIFE WITHOUT FLAVORED CHIPS?

684
00:18:32,976 --> 00:18:34,878
YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY FLAVORS?

685
00:18:34,878 --> 00:18:37,113
>> IS RANCID A FLAVOR?

686
00:18:37,113 --> 00:18:37,981
>> YOU MUST HAVE BEEN LIVING IN

687
00:18:37,981 --> 00:18:39,516
THE STONE AGE.

688
00:18:39,516 --> 00:18:40,183
WHAT?

689
00:18:40,183 --> 00:18:40,950
HOW COME?

690
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:41,785
WAS IT, LIKE, THEY JUST DIDN'T

691
00:18:41,785 --> 00:18:43,086
HAVE, LIKE THE TECHNOLOGY OR

692
00:18:43,086 --> 00:18:44,788
SOMETHING, OR WAS IT SHORTAGES

693
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:47,457
AFTER THE WAR?

694
00:18:47,457 --> 00:18:48,458
HOW COME?

695
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,392
MAYBE SOME--MAYBE SOMEBODY

696
00:18:49,392 --> 00:18:50,260
JUST DIDN'T THINK OF IT?

697
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,261
THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO

698
00:18:51,261 --> 00:18:54,097
WALK ALONG AND HAVE A DREAM?

699
00:18:54,097 --> 00:18:55,465
>> YEAH, YEAH, OKAY, HAROLD.

700
00:18:55,465 --> 00:18:56,866
BUT NOW, A 5¢ BAG OF CHIPS COSTS

701
00:18:56,866 --> 00:18:58,201
YOU A BUCK 69.

702
00:18:58,201 --> 00:18:59,836
>> YES, THAT IS TRUE, BUT YOUR

703
00:18:59,836 --> 00:19:00,737
BREATH SMELLS LIKE YOU HAD AN

704
00:19:00,737 --> 00:19:04,441
ENTIRE MEAL.

705
00:19:04,441 --> 00:19:05,208
>> DON'T GO AWAY.

706
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,643
I THINK YOU'LL ENJOY THE END OF

707
00:19:06,643 --> 00:19:08,344
THE JET SKI STORY.

708
00:19:08,344 --> 00:19:09,145
>> WELL, AT LEAST IT'LL ALL BE

709
00:19:09,145 --> 00:19:10,280
OVER AND DONE WITH, AND THAT

710
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,482
PART IS ENJOYABLE, SO I AGREE.

711
00:19:22,392 --> 00:19:24,127
>> HE WAS BUILT LIKE A PEAR

712
00:19:24,127 --> 00:19:26,362
KIND OF STOCKY AND SHORT

713
00:19:26,362 --> 00:19:27,864
HIS REAL NAME WAS LEONARD

714
00:19:27,864 --> 00:19:30,533
BUT WE JUST CALLED HIM WART

715
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:31,801
NOBODY LIKED HIM

716
00:19:31,801 --> 00:19:33,703
HE WAS EXTREMELY OBNOXIOUS

717
00:19:33,703 --> 00:19:35,772
BUT HE WAS KIND OF FUN

718
00:19:35,772 --> 00:19:36,439
TO SLAP

719
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:37,941
AND HE ALWAYS LOST BIG

720
00:19:37,941 --> 00:19:38,708
AT POKER

721
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,677
SO WE LET HIM STAY

722
00:19:43,947 --> 00:19:45,315
IT IS AUTUMN.

723
00:19:45,315 --> 00:19:46,983
YESTERDAY, THE SKY OVERHEAD WAS

724
00:19:46,983 --> 00:19:48,551
ALIVE WITH GEESE.

725
00:19:48,551 --> 00:19:50,286
TODAY THE DUCKS CIRCLE OVERHEAD

726
00:19:50,286 --> 00:19:51,788
IN GROWING FLOCKS.

727
00:19:51,788 --> 00:19:53,256
TOMORROW, THE SKY WILL BE DARK

728
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:54,524
WITH BLACKBIRDS.

729
00:19:54,524 --> 00:19:56,059
THE NEXT DAY, ROBINS OR PERHAPS

730
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:57,160
CROWS.

731
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,361
I THINK I NEED TO FIND A

732
00:19:58,361 --> 00:20:02,031
DIFFERENT PLACE TO PARK MY CAR.

733
00:20:02,031 --> 00:20:03,700
WELL, THAT WATER IS COLD.

734
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,567
WOULDN'T WANT TO GO

735
00:20:04,567 --> 00:20:05,735
SKINNY-DIPPING HERE.

736
00:20:05,735 --> 00:20:08,571
THAT WOULD SHRINK YOUR LEVI'S.

737
00:20:08,571 --> 00:20:10,707
>> YEAH, YOU'D GET USED TO IT.

738
00:20:10,707 --> 00:20:12,842
WHEN I WORKED UP IN THE YUKON,

739
00:20:12,842 --> 00:20:14,711
WE'D GO SPEARFISHING UNDER THE

740
00:20:14,711 --> 00:20:16,512
ICE.

741
00:20:16,512 --> 00:20:17,580
>> OH, YOU MEAN ICE FISHING,

742
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,248
WHERE YOU CUT A HOLE AND FISH

743
00:20:19,248 --> 00:20:19,916
THROUGH IT?

744
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,451
>> NAH, THAT'S KID'S STUFF.

745
00:20:21,451 --> 00:20:22,585
NO, WE'D CUT A HOLE AND DIVE

746
00:20:22,585 --> 00:20:24,253
THROUGH.

747
00:20:24,253 --> 00:20:25,488
SOMETIMES YOUR HEART WOULD STOP

748
00:20:25,488 --> 00:20:27,123
FOR A FEW MINUTES, BUT IT WAS A

749
00:20:27,123 --> 00:20:29,125
LOT OF FUN.

750
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,059
>> ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT YOU

751
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:31,594
SWAM AROUND IN ICE-COLD WATER

752
00:20:31,594 --> 00:20:33,296
CHASING FISH WITH A SPEAR GUN?

753
00:20:33,296 --> 00:20:34,497
>> YEAH, WE HAD THIS CEREMONIAL

754
00:20:34,497 --> 00:20:36,632
HEADDRESS COVERED IN WORMS TO

755
00:20:36,632 --> 00:20:38,034
ATTRACT THE FISH, AND THE FISH

756
00:20:38,034 --> 00:20:39,736
WOULD COME AROUND, AND YOU'D

757
00:20:39,736 --> 00:20:40,636
SPEAR 'EM AND SLIP THEM INTO

758
00:20:40,636 --> 00:20:41,537
YOUR UNDERWEAR.

759
00:20:41,537 --> 00:20:43,272
WHEN YOUR SKIVVIES WERE FILLED

760
00:20:43,272 --> 00:20:45,274
WITH COD, YOU'D COME UP FOR AIR.

761
00:20:45,274 --> 00:20:46,976
I ONCE HAD A WHOLE PANT LOAD OF

762
00:20:46,976 --> 00:20:48,344
FISH ITCHING TO GET OUT, CAME UP

763
00:20:48,344 --> 00:20:50,146
FOR AIR, AND MY HOLE HAD FROZEN

764
00:20:50,146 --> 00:20:51,814
OVER.

765
00:20:51,814 --> 00:20:53,749
>> I'M NOT SURPRISED.

766
00:20:53,749 --> 00:20:54,951
WHAT DID YOU DO?

767
00:20:54,951 --> 00:20:56,252
>> ONLY THING I COULD DO.

768
00:20:56,252 --> 00:20:57,520
HOOKED THOSE FISH ONTO MY BELT

769
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,588
LOOPS, AND THEY TOWED ME INTO

770
00:20:58,588 --> 00:21:00,756
OPEN WATER.

771
00:21:00,756 --> 00:21:01,624
>> ARE YOU SAYING YOU HAD BELT

772
00:21:01,624 --> 00:21:04,961
LOOPS ON YOUR UNDERWEAR, HAP?

773
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:05,695
>> [chuckles]

774
00:21:05,695 --> 00:21:06,896
IF YOU WERE EVER UP IN THE

775
00:21:06,896 --> 00:21:08,831
ARCTIC, YOU'D KNOW BETTER THAN

776
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:09,932
TO ASK A QUESTION LIKE THAT,

777
00:21:09,932 --> 00:21:11,934
RED.

778
00:21:11,934 --> 00:21:13,503
>> WELL, WASN'T A BAD QUESTION.

779
00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:14,871
JUST CURIOUS, THAT'S ALL.

780
00:21:14,871 --> 00:21:15,838
>> NO.

781
00:21:15,838 --> 00:21:16,806
STORY'S OVER.

782
00:21:16,806 --> 00:21:17,773
WHEN YOU START TO NITPICK ON THE

783
00:21:17,773 --> 00:21:19,175
DETAIL, TAKES THE FUN OUT OF THE

784
00:21:19,175 --> 00:21:21,143
TELLING.

785
00:21:28,117 --> 00:21:29,986
>> WELL, SO ANYWAY, MOOSE

786
00:21:29,986 --> 00:21:31,153
THOMPSON MADE HIS OWN LITTLE

787
00:21:31,153 --> 00:21:32,922
HOMEMADE JET SKI OUT OF OUR

788
00:21:32,922 --> 00:21:34,357
SNOWMOBILE AND ABOUT NINE LIFE

789
00:21:34,357 --> 00:21:36,225
JACKETS, AND THE THING'S SITTING

790
00:21:36,225 --> 00:21:37,593
DOWN ON THE DOCK, JUST REVVING

791
00:21:37,593 --> 00:21:38,561
THERE, YOU KNOW.

792
00:21:38,561 --> 00:21:40,096
AND HE WAS READY FOR A LONG RUN,

793
00:21:40,096 --> 00:21:42,531
SO HE HAD ABOUT NINE UNWRAPPED

794
00:21:42,531 --> 00:21:43,733
KETCHUP SANDWICHES KIND OF

795
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:45,034
JAMMED AT RANDOM INTO THE GLOVE

796
00:21:45,034 --> 00:21:46,936
COMPARTMENT, AND HE HAD HIS HIP

797
00:21:46,936 --> 00:21:48,337
WADERS FULL OF EXTRA GAS, WHICH

798
00:21:48,337 --> 00:21:50,139
IS NOTHING NEW, YOU KNOW.

799
00:21:50,139 --> 00:21:52,041
BUT ANYWAY, MOOSE GETS ON THERE,

800
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,209
AND HE HITS THE THROTTLE, AND

801
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:54,944
OFF SHE GOES, AND THEN, BY GOD,

802
00:21:54,944 --> 00:21:56,379
HE SLAMMED SO HARD DOWN ON THE

803
00:21:56,379 --> 00:21:57,647
LAKE THAT THE SANDWICHES ALL FLY

804
00:21:57,647 --> 00:21:58,481
OUT OF THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT,

805
00:21:58,481 --> 00:22:00,082
AND THE SEAT JAMMED SO FAR UP

806
00:22:00,082 --> 00:22:01,384
THE HIP WADERS THAT CAN'T GET

807
00:22:01,384 --> 00:22:02,218
OFF, ALL RIGHT.

808
00:22:02,218 --> 00:22:03,019
[laughs]

809
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:04,353
HE STARTS CIRCLING AROUND

810
00:22:04,353 --> 00:22:05,855
'CAUSE HE SOON REALIZED THAT

811
00:22:05,855 --> 00:22:07,123
THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN STAY AFLOAT

812
00:22:07,123 --> 00:22:09,058
IS TO KEEP HER WIDE OPEN, YOU

813
00:22:09,058 --> 00:22:10,159
KNOW, AND MEANWHILE THE FISH ARE

814
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,327
EATING HIS LUNCH AND TURNING

815
00:22:11,327 --> 00:22:12,194
BELLY UP.

816
00:22:12,194 --> 00:22:13,729
WELL, YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME HE

817
00:22:13,729 --> 00:22:15,031
GOES BY THE DOCK, HE YELLS

818
00:22:15,031 --> 00:22:16,032
SOMETHING AT US, BUT WE'RE OF

819
00:22:16,032 --> 00:22:17,099
COURSE LAUGHING SO HARD WE CAN'T

820
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:18,601
HEAR HIM, YOU KNOW.

821
00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:19,635
ROUND AND ROUND HE GOES, AND OF

822
00:22:19,635 --> 00:22:20,469
COURSE, FROM SHORE, YOU KNOW,

823
00:22:20,469 --> 00:22:22,038
HE'S KICKING UP ABOUT, OH, I'D

824
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:22,972
SAY A 12-FOOT WAKE.

825
00:22:22,972 --> 00:22:24,640
ALL WE'RE SEEING IS, LIKE, A

826
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,509
HUGE SWELL WITH MOOSE'S HEAD ON

827
00:22:26,509 --> 00:22:27,676
THE TOP, WHICH IS ACTUALLY A

828
00:22:27,676 --> 00:22:28,878
PRETTY GOOD DESCRIPTION OF MOOSE

829
00:22:28,878 --> 00:22:30,146
EVEN ON DRY LAND.

830
00:22:30,146 --> 00:22:31,347
WELL, YOU KNOW, HE SAID TO US

831
00:22:31,347 --> 00:22:32,515
THAT HE WAS GONNA MAKE IT ALL

832
00:22:32,515 --> 00:22:33,649
THE WAY ACROSS THE LAKE, AND WE

833
00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:34,550
GOT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT.

834
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,152
HE WAS HALF RIGHT.

835
00:22:36,152 --> 00:22:38,254
ANYWAY, IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

836
00:22:38,254 --> 00:22:39,555
I'M GONNA BE COMING STRAIGHT

837
00:22:39,555 --> 00:22:41,357
HOME AFTER THE SHOW, AND MAYBE

838
00:22:41,357 --> 00:22:43,426
I'LL BRING A BOTTLE OF WINE.

839
00:22:43,426 --> 00:22:44,693
WE CAN FRY UP SOME BACON OR

840
00:22:44,693 --> 00:22:45,628
SOMETHING.

841
00:22:45,628 --> 00:22:47,496
SO THANK YOU ALL FOR WATCHING.

842
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:48,898
HOPE YOU ENJOYED SHOW, AND UNTIL

843
00:22:48,898 --> 00:22:50,099
NEXT TIME, ON BEHALF OF MYSELF

844
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:52,334
AND HAROLD THERE AND THE REST

845
00:22:52,334 --> 00:22:53,502
OF THE GANG UP AT THE LODGE

846
00:22:53,502 --> 00:22:54,837
HERE, KEEP YOUR STICK

847
00:22:54,837 --> 00:22:55,871
ON THE ICE.

848
00:22:55,871 --> 00:22:58,841
[applause]

849
00:23:09,552 --> 00:23:11,053
IT IS SPRING,

850
00:23:11,053 --> 00:23:12,488
A TIME FOR ME TO FACE THE

851
00:23:12,488 --> 00:23:14,290
REALITY THAT I AM AS OLD AS THE

852
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,624
LODGE ROOF.

853
00:23:15,624 --> 00:23:16,659
WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON,

854
00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:18,093
THAT ROOF AND I.

855
00:23:18,093 --> 00:23:19,528
WE BOTH LEAK, WE BOTH HAVE

856
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:20,663
SHINGLES, AND WE BOTH END

857
00:23:20,663 --> 00:23:22,631
IN THE GUTTER.
