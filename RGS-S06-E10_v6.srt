1
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:04,170
IT’S THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW.

2
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:07,607
HERE'S THE HOST WITH THE MOST,

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:10,110
IN TERMS OF FACIAL HAIR
AND CREDITORS, THAT IS,

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,446
YOUR HERO, MY UNCLE, RED GREEN!

5
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:18,351
(Applause and cheering)

6
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,120
HEY, HAROLD.

7
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,621
APPRECIATE IT.

8
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,490
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,692
WELL, BY GOLLY.

10
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,292
YOU'VE PROBABLY GUESSED,

11
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:27,861
TODAY IS OUR ANNUAL TOURNAMENT

12
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,562
FOR THOSE OF US IN THE P.G.A.,

13
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,397
POSSUM GOLF ASSOCIATION.

14
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,399
SO, IN A FEW MINUTES

15
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:34,968
THE LODGE MEMBERS WILL BE OUT THERE

16
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,169
THWACKING THEIR NIBLICKS

17
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:37,370
AND SWINGING THEIR MASHIES

18
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,638
OUT ON THE LINKS.

19
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,440
YOU GUYS BELONG OUT ON

20
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,142
THE LINKS, THE MISSING LINKS.

21
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,244
HA! HA! HA!

22
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:45,945
THE MISSING LINKS!

23
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,915
I HEARD YOU GUYS WERE BANNED
FROM THE GOLF COURSE

24
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:50,517
FOR LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE.

25
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:55,088
WELL, YEAH, WE PLAYED THE GAME
THE WAY THE BRITISH PLAY GOLF,

26
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:56,990
WHERE THEY DIVIDE IT UP
INTO TEAMS.

27
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,024
POLO.

28
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,494
THEY PLAYED POLO
ON A PUBLIC GOLF COURSE.

29
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,497
WE WEREN'T PLAYING POLO.

30
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:06,599
ON POLO, THEY'RE ON HORSES THERE.

31
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,668
WE WERE ON
ALL-TERRAIN VEHICLES.

32
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:13,673
(Horns honking)

33
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,444
(Geese honking)

34
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:20,880
(Quacking)

35
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,084
(Red): YOU'RE LOOKIN'
AT SEGMENTS

36
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,653
FROM THIS PARTICULAR SHOW,

37
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:27,754
THE MESSAGE BEING,

38
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,389
DON'T THINK ABOUT

39
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:30,156
CHANGING THE CHANNEL.

40
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:31,724
I’LL TELL YOU SOMETHING,

41
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:33,660
TO MAKE SENSE
OUT OF THIS PROGRAMME,

42
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:34,727
YOU GOTTA GIVE IT

43
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:36,663
YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.

44
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,074
WELL, EVEN THOUGH WE'VE BEEN BANNED

45
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:49,909
FROM THE POSSUM LAKE
GOLF AND SKI CLUB,

46
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:51,911
WE'RE GOING AHEAD
WITH OUR TOURNAMENT

47
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,312
AT ANOTHER LOCATION.

48
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:54,814
AT FIRST, WE WERE THINKING OF USING

49
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,250
THE PORT ASBESTOS INSTITUTE
FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE.

50
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,553
THEY GOT THAT BIG GRASSY AREA.

51
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,989
BUT, THE INMATES

52
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,624
THOUGHT IT WOULD
INTERFERE WITH THEIR REHAB.

53
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:06,092
SO, INSTEAD,

54
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,594
WE'RE GOING TO USE A COURSE
BY THE DRIVE-IN THEATRE.

55
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:11,798
WHAT COURSE IS THAT?

56
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,934
THERE'S THAT EMPTY FIELD
WITH OLD SCHOOL BUSES IN IT.

57
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:17,570
THEN THERE'S CITY HALL,
THE GO-KART TRACK,

58
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,704
THEN THERE'S THE HOSPITAL.

59
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,206
AFTER THAT--

60
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:21,707
HA! HA-HA!

61
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:24,944
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
YOUR TOURNAMENT

62
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,779
AT PETE'S PARK AND PUTT
MINI GOLF!

63
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,615
OH, YES!

64
00:02:29,615 --> 00:02:31,951
WELL, MAYBE IT'S NOT
THE MASTERS.

65
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,320
BUT IT'S FLAT, IT'S GREEN,
IT'S GOT 18 HOLES.

66
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,789
BIG WHOOP -- SO DOES
MOOSE THOMPSON'S UNDERWEAR.

67
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,257
BIG DEAL.

68
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,128
(Red): SOMETHING SPECIAL--
OH BOY.

69
00:02:42,728 --> 00:02:44,864
I WAS ABOUT TO SAY
SOMETHING SPECIAL THIS WEEK.

70
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,500
BILL INVITED ME TO COME
OVER AND DO SOME,

71
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,001
GONNA DO SOME GLASS BLOWING.

72
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:51,070
HE WANTED ME TO PICK UP
A BOOK FROM THE LIBRARY.

73
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,872
DIDN’T REALIZE WE HAD
A LIBRARY IN TOWN.

74
00:02:53,372 --> 00:02:54,807
THERE WE GO.

75
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,742
GLASS BLOWING MADE EASY.

76
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,612
IT’S A BOOK THAT’S
ALL ABOUT GLASS BLOWING

77
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,480
BOY, IT WAS A HOT DAY.

78
00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:05,284
I'M TRYING TO GIVE HIM A HINT
AS TO HOW WARM I...

79
00:03:05,284 --> 00:03:06,719
BILL, I'M KINDA WARM HERE.

80
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,988
IF YOU HAD ANY KIND OF
A SOFT DRINK--

81
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:10,423
THERE WE GO.

82
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,124
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

83
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,827
I DON'T KNOW
HOW COLD THAT WILL BE.

84
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,696
WELL, THAT COOLED ME DOWN
A LITTLE.

85
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,166
MIND YOU, I WAS HOPING TO
TAKE IT INTERNALLY.

86
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,801
NOT SOMETHING I SAY
ALL THAT OFTEN.

87
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,903
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, BILL?

88
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:27,873
FOR GOSH SAKES,
HE WANTS TO USE THE BOTTLES.

89
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:30,076
THIS IS AN ANCIENT ART.

90
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,945
YOU TAKE ANY KIND OF GLASS.

91
00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:35,214
I GUESS HE WANTED
THE COLOUR OF THE BOTTLES.

92
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:36,716
BECAUSE YOU GET THAT IN THERE,
AND THEN IT WOULD COLOR--

93
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,750
(Glass breaking)

94
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,851
(Cow mooing)

95
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,553
OH BOY.

96
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:44,390
I THINK HE MAY HAVE HIT
ELSIE THE SAFETY COW

97
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,092
WITH A PIECE OF SHREDDED GLASS.

98
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,828
ANYWAY, THERE'S ANOTHER SOURCE
OF GLASS.

99
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:51,197
THESE ARE NEVER PROBLEMS,
THEY'RE OPPORTUNITIES.

100
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:52,031
RIGHT BILL?

101
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,701
HE CAN GET THAT WINDOW GLASS
IN THERE WITH THE BOTTLES

102
00:03:55,701 --> 00:03:57,303
AND THE VARIOUS OTHER GLASSES
HE HAS IN THERE.

103
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:58,904
AND THEN JUST KIND OF, YUP.

104
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:02,608
YOU WANT TO BREAK THEM UP
INTO THE SMALL, TINY PIECES.

105
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,410
AND JUST, UH...

106
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:08,080
I'M STARTING TO WONDER ABOUT
BILL'S ABILITY TO GRIP THINGS.

107
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,115
ANYWAY...

108
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,217
SO... OH.

109
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:15,087
NOW HE'S ADDED SAFETY GLASS,
WHICH IS A GOOD IDEA WITH BILL.

110
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:16,689
ANYWAYS,

111
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,824
HOPEFULLY,
HE'S GOT ENOUGH GLASS.

112
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,861
NOW HE CAN BREAK THAT
INTO LITTLE PIECES.

113
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,896
JUST USE THE VAN
ANY WAY YOU WANT, BILL.

114
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,598
THAT’S FINE,
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY FINE.

115
00:04:26,031 --> 00:04:28,334
AND YOU CAN USE
ANY KIND OF GLASS YOU WANT.

116
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:30,603
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

117
00:04:30,736 --> 00:04:32,671
WHERE'S YOUR GLASSES, BILL?

118
00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:35,274
(Laughing)

119
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,642
(Audience laughing)

120
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,444
(Strums acoustic guitar)

121
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:42,648
OH, ALL THE MEN
UP HERE KNEW HER

122
00:04:42,848 --> 00:04:45,951
THEY CALLED HER
THE ROSE OF THE LODGE

123
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:49,188
SHE HAD A FACE
OF AN ANGEL

124
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:52,558
AND THE REAR END
OF A '53 DODGE

125
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,961
OH, THE ROSE OF THE LODGE
THEY CALLED HER

126
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:59,732
AND I'LL TELL YOU
THE REASON FOR THAT

127
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:01,867
HER FATHER WAS BUD

128
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,135
HER MOM WAS A CLIMBER

129
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:05,738
AND SHE HAD THORNS
ALL OVER HER BACK

130
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,306
(Strums acoustic guitar)

131
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,910
OK, TODAY'S CONTESTANTS
ARE PLAYING FOR

132
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,748
A FREE OIL, LUBE AND FLUID CHECK
FROM STANLEY'S FRIED CHICKEN.

133
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,684
UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO GET MR. DALTON HUMPHREY

134
00:05:18,684 --> 00:05:20,119
OF THE HUMPHREY’S
EVERYTHING STORE

135
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,154
TO SAY THIS WORD.

136
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:24,356
"IMAGINATIVE."

137
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,558
AND GO!

138
00:05:26,558 --> 00:05:27,993
ALL RIGHT,
DALTON.

139
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,228
CREATIVE.

140
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:30,429
SNEAKY.

141
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:33,565
SOMEONE WITH
ORIGINAL IDEAS IS...

142
00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:35,634
TROUBLE-MAKER.

143
00:05:35,634 --> 00:05:37,102
BAD INFLUENCE.

144
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:38,604
IT'S A FOREIGNER.

145
00:05:38,737 --> 00:05:40,739
(Audience laughing)

146
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:45,344
NO -- PEOPLE WHO WRITE BOOKS
AND MAKE MOVIES AND HAVE ART,

147
00:05:45,477 --> 00:05:47,246
THEY'RE
VERY...
RICH.

148
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,480
NO, NO, NO...

149
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:50,382
PEOPLE WHO SEE THINGS
OTHER PEOPLE DON'T SEE.

150
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:52,217
OH... DELUSIONAL.

151
00:05:52,217 --> 00:05:53,218
NO, NO, NO...

152
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:53,986
WEIRD.

153
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:54,820
SICK IN THE HEAD.

154
00:05:54,953 --> 00:05:55,954
NO, NO, NO...

155
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:57,489
INVENTIVE.

156
00:05:57,489 --> 00:05:59,057
OH... SMART ALECK.
NO.

157
00:05:59,591 --> 00:06:00,459
INGENIOUS.

158
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:02,494
NOT NORMAL.

159
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:05,164
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT DALTON.
PEOPLE BUY THAT CRAP IN YOUR STORE.

160
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:06,365
THEY THINK THAT YOU’RE
LYING, CHEATING,

161
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,566
YOU'RE RIPPING THEM OFF.

162
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:09,968
BUT IN YOUR MIND, YOU'RE BEING...
IMAGINATIVE.

163
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:11,203
THERE WE GO!

164
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,571
THERE YOU GO.

165
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,742
THIS WEEK ON HANDYMAN CORNER,

166
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:19,578
I THOUGHT I'D TAKE
OLD MAN SEDGWICK'S COFFEE TABLE

167
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,814
AND RESTORE IT TO
ITS ORIGINAL CONDITION.

168
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:25,317
MAYBE NOT ORIGINAL CONDITION,
BUT THE CONDITION IT WAS IN

169
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:27,452
BEFORE MOOSE THOMPSON
SAT ON IT.

170
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,987
(Blowing)

171
00:06:29,054 --> 00:06:32,324
THE PROBLEM HERE IS THE LEGS
ARE WAY TOO SPINDLY ON THIS,

172
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:34,426
AS THEY ARE ON
OLD MAN SEDGWICK.

173
00:06:34,526 --> 00:06:37,362
SO, I'M GOING TO FIX THAT UP.

174
00:06:37,462 --> 00:06:40,165
I GUESS A LOT OF PEOPLE
WOULD THROW THAT OUT.

175
00:06:40,165 --> 00:06:43,035
BUT, HEY, I'M NOT
A LOT OF PEOPLE.

176
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:44,603
I'M BARELY ME.

177
00:06:44,736 --> 00:06:48,006
I'M GOING TO TURN A NEW SET
OF LEGS FOR THAT TABLE

178
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:50,208
WITH THIS ELECTRIC LATHE.

179
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:52,844
THE ELECTRIC LATHE,
GREAT FOR MAKING ROUND STUFF,

180
00:06:52,844 --> 00:06:56,648
LIKE CANDLESTICK HOLDERS,
SWIMMING POOLS, HATS.

181
00:06:57,015 --> 00:07:01,453
TAKE THE WOOD STOCK--
WELL, NOT WOODSTOCK REALLY.

182
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:03,956
AND YOU JUST FIRE THAT
IN THERE, JUST LIKE THAT.

183
00:07:04,623 --> 00:07:06,792
AND YOU TAKE ONE
OF THESE TOOLS,

184
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:09,928
LIKE THIS, AND SHAVE OFF
ANYTHING THAT ISN'T ROUND.

185
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:13,031
LIKE WHAT YOU DO IN THE SHOWER
IN THE MORNING.

186
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:14,132
PLUG HER IN.

187
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:16,168
FIRE HER UP.

188
00:07:16,902 --> 00:07:18,270
(Sparking)

189
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,871
(Glass breaking)

190
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,074
(Sparking)

191
00:07:22,307 --> 00:07:23,909
OKAY, DID I MENTION TO MAKE SURE

192
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:26,311
THAT YOU CENTRE THE WOOD
IN THE LATHE?

193
00:07:27,245 --> 00:07:29,881
MARK THE CENTRE OF EACH END
OF THE PIECE OF WOOD

194
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:33,852
USING THE MOST ACCURATE DEVICE
IN THE HANDYMAN'S REPERTOIRE,

195
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,620
YOUR EYE.

196
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:38,957
(Sparking)

197
00:07:38,957 --> 00:07:40,726
(Lathe starting)

198
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,928
(Crashing)

199
00:07:44,663 --> 00:07:46,865
(Glass breaking)

200
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,734
SO I'M THINKING, HEY,

201
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:52,671
IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE
ROUND THINGS OUT OF WOOD,

202
00:07:52,737 --> 00:07:55,340
WHY NOT START WITH
A ROUND PIECE OF WOOD?

203
00:07:55,407 --> 00:07:57,742
SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T
FIGURE THAT OUT EARLIER.

204
00:07:57,809 --> 00:08:00,512
LET'S HAVE A SERIOUS MOMENT
NOW, THOUGH, ABOUT SAFETY.

205
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:01,613
PROTECTION FOR YOURSELVES.

206
00:08:01,613 --> 00:08:03,482
THAT'S A VERY POWERFUL
INDUSTRIAL TOOL.

207
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:07,786
I'D RECOMMEND YOU GET
A HIGH-QUALITY SAFETY HELMET,

208
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:10,655
SOME SORT OF EYE SHIELD,

209
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:12,724
SAFETY-GOGGLE TYPE OF UNIT.

210
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,926
AND EXTRA THICK
INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH GLOVES.

211
00:08:14,993 --> 00:08:16,461
ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT.

212
00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:19,464
THIS IS YOUR HEALTH AT STAKE HERE.

213
00:08:19,698 --> 00:08:21,299
THERE WAS ONE OTHER THING.

214
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:22,467
CAN'T REMEMBER.

215
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:23,802
I GUESS IT WASN'T IMPORTANT.

216
00:08:24,135 --> 00:08:25,570
LET'S GET LATHING.

217
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:28,740
THE TOOLS ARE OVER THERE.

218
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,108
(Ripping)

219
00:08:34,112 --> 00:08:36,915
THAT WAS THE THING
I FORGOT TO MENTION.

220
00:08:37,115 --> 00:08:38,984
DON'T WEAR LOOSE CLOTHING.

221
00:08:40,952 --> 00:08:43,355
OK, LET'S MAKE TABLE LEGS.

222
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:47,158
(Glass breaking)

223
00:08:47,892 --> 00:08:49,394
WRONG TOOL.

224
00:08:57,636 --> 00:08:59,237
AND, LOOK AT THAT!

225
00:08:59,304 --> 00:09:03,775
YOU'VE MADE LEGS FOR YOUR TABLE
USING YOUR LATHE.

226
00:09:03,775 --> 00:09:04,709
HA HA HA HA.

227
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:06,144
JUST THAT SIMPLE.

228
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:09,414
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

229
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:11,082
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

230
00:09:13,418 --> 00:09:15,086
(Wood snapping)

231
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,522
OH BOY.

232
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:19,758
STAY TUNED AND RELAX.

233
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:21,926
WHATEVER THIS IS,
WE'VE GOT A LOT MORE OF IT.

234
00:09:27,499 --> 00:09:28,466
ALRIGHT.

235
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:33,204
WELCOME TO "AUTOBIOGRAPHY",
WHERE MEMBERS OF POSSUM LODGE

236
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:37,776
TALK ABOUT CARS THAT HAVE
SOME SIGNIFICANCE TO THEM.

237
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,278
THIS WEEK WE HAVE
WINSTON ROTHSCHILD

238
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:43,348
OF ROTHSCHILD SEWAGE
AND SEPTIC SUCKING SERVICES.

239
00:09:43,348 --> 00:09:45,517
NO TANK TOO BIG,
NO TANK TOO SMALL.

240
00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:48,319
TEACUP OR CESSPOOL,
WE SUCK 'EM ALL.

241
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:50,922
(Audience laughing)

242
00:09:51,156 --> 00:09:53,858
(Applause)

243
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:55,126
ARE WE THERE YET?

244
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:56,094
YEAH, WE’RE ALRIGHT.

245
00:09:56,861 --> 00:09:58,897
WINSTON, MAYBE YOU COULD
TELL US ABOUT

246
00:09:58,897 --> 00:10:00,165
YOUR FIRST CAR.

247
00:10:00,165 --> 00:10:01,399
OH GEEZ, GREAT MEMORY.

248
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,934
SHE WAS AN OLD FORD.

249
00:10:03,268 --> 00:10:04,135
I'LL NEVER FORGET.

250
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:06,070
COUNTRY SQUIRE RANCH WAGON.

251
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:07,272
YEAH, I REMEMBER IT.

252
00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:08,806
THAT'S THE ONE THAT HAD

253
00:10:08,806 --> 00:10:11,209
THE REAL, HONEST TO GOODNESS,
IMITATION-WOOD SIDES.

254
00:10:11,476 --> 00:10:12,911
(Audience laughing)

255
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:14,979
WHAT A GREAT CAR
THOSE FORDS WERE.

256
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,715
THE BODY, FORGET ABOUT IT.

257
00:10:17,715 --> 00:10:19,617
RUSTS RIGHT OFF.

258
00:10:19,717 --> 00:10:21,619
BUT THE V8 ENGINE,
GO FOREVER.

259
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,558
YOU KNOW, THE NEW FORDS, UH,
JUST DON'T RUST LIKE THE OLD ONES.

260
00:10:26,558 --> 00:10:28,760
(Audience laughing)

261
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,261
SORT OF MISS THAT,
TO BE HONEST.

262
00:10:30,261 --> 00:10:31,796
YEAH.

263
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:33,264
THAT WAGON,
THAT WAS A BIG UNIT.

264
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:34,332
OH, IT WAS HUGE!

265
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:37,535
I RAN MY FIRST BUSINESS
OUT OF THAT WAGON.

266
00:10:37,535 --> 00:10:38,603
DID NOT KNOW THAT, SIR.

267
00:10:38,736 --> 00:10:40,972
I THOUGHT YOU JUST HAD
THE SEPTIC BUSINESS.

268
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:42,774
WHAT WERE YOU DOING THEN?

269
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:43,775
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

270
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:44,842
WHAT?

271
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:46,945
OH YEAH.

272
00:10:46,945 --> 00:10:48,680
I MOUNTED THE PUMP
IN THE PASSENGER SIDE

273
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,981
RIGHT NEXT TO ME.

274
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:51,082
WHERE YOU ARE.

275
00:10:51,082 --> 00:10:54,319
THEN I'D FLIP
THE BACKSEAT DOWN

276
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:57,755
THEN I’D PUT A SWIMMING POOL
LINER IN THERE.

277
00:10:58,022 --> 00:11:00,758
SHE'D HOLD 400 GALLONS.

278
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,029
SO YOU’RE CARRYING SEWAGE
AROUND IN THE BACK OF YOUR CAR?

279
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,531
FOR A SHORT TIME,

280
00:11:06,531 --> 00:11:08,366
UNTIL I GOT ENOUGH MONEY
FOR THE DOWNPAYMENT

281
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:10,168
ON THE TRUCK --
BUT I WAS MOTIVATED

282
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:12,336
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, THAT WAS
THE HOTTEST SUMMER ON RECORD.

283
00:11:12,437 --> 00:11:13,871
(Audience laughing)

284
00:11:14,372 --> 00:11:16,174
BUT, HERE'S WHAT I DID.

285
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,710
I WOULD POP OUT
THE FRONT WINDSHIELD,

286
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,446
AND I'D STICK MY HEAD
OUT THE SIDE.

287
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:23,347
AND I'D GO LIKE A BANSHEE,
AND THE WIND

288
00:11:23,347 --> 00:11:26,284
WOULD KNOCK ALL OF THAT
INTO THE BACK.

289
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,852
OH, SURE, YEAH.

290
00:11:27,852 --> 00:11:29,654
ALTHOUGH, I GOT TO TELL YOU,

291
00:11:30,555 --> 00:11:32,523
I STILL BREAK OUT INTO
A COLD SWEAT

292
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,825
EVERY TIME I SEE A STOP SIGN.

293
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:37,061
(Audience laughing)

294
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:39,564
(Playing bagpipes)

295
00:11:39,564 --> 00:11:41,232
OH!

296
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:44,635
(Audience laughing)

297
00:11:44,635 --> 00:11:47,238
(Applause)

298
00:11:47,238 --> 00:11:49,106
(Cheering)

299
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:52,643
(Cheering and whistling)

300
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,912
YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH.

301
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:57,748
WELL... WELL, WE HAD OUR ANNUAL

302
00:11:57,782 --> 00:12:00,251
GOLF TOURNAMENT AT
PETE'S PARK AND PUTT MINI GOLF.

303
00:12:00,351 --> 00:12:02,420
WE CARRIED ON THE PROUD
POSSUM LODGE TRADITION

304
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,789
OF GETTING BANNED
FROM EVERYWHERE WE GO.

305
00:12:04,822 --> 00:12:06,324
(Snaps putter)

306
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:08,359
YEAH!

307
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:09,861
(Rattling)

308
00:12:11,495 --> 00:12:13,965
(Whimpering)

309
00:12:14,265 --> 00:12:17,535
I DIDN'T KNOW GOLF WAS
A FULL-CONTACT SPORT.

310
00:12:17,602 --> 00:12:19,136
IT IS, THE WAY WE PLAY IT, HAROLD.

311
00:12:19,203 --> 00:12:22,039
ALTHOUGH IN FAIRNESS,
THE MINIATURE GOLF THING

312
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,007
CONFUSED SOME OF THE GUYS.

313
00:12:23,074 --> 00:12:25,610
WE SHOULD HAVE TOLD THEM
NOT TO USE DRIVERS.

314
00:12:25,676 --> 00:12:27,778
YEAH, AND THEIR
ELECTRIC GOLF CARTS.

315
00:12:27,845 --> 00:12:29,113
YEAH.

316
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,515
THOSE GUYS ARE THE WORST SPORTS
I'VE EVER SEEN.

317
00:12:31,515 --> 00:12:33,084
GOLF'S A FRUSTRATING GAME, HAROLD.

318
00:12:33,084 --> 00:12:34,452
THE GUYS’ TEMPER GETS AHOLD OF THEM

319
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:35,953
ESPECIALLY THAT HOLE
WHERE YOU PUTT

320
00:12:35,953 --> 00:12:39,123
BETWEEN THE LEGS OF SNOW WHITE
AND THE SEVEN DWARFS.

321
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,925
ON HIS 9th TRY,
STINKY LOST HIS TEMPER

322
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:44,028
AND BURIED HIS PITCHING WEDGE
IN SNEEZY'S FOREHEAD.

323
00:12:44,695 --> 00:12:46,063
CLEARED HIS SINUSES.

324
00:12:46,063 --> 00:12:47,498
YEAH.

325
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:49,667
ANYWAY, WE FIGURED OUT THAT

326
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:51,702
THE PROBLEM WITH MINIATURE GOLF
IS NOT THE GOLF.

327
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:53,437
IT'S THE MINIATURE.

328
00:12:53,437 --> 00:12:56,607
WE'RE GONNA START AGAIN WITH
A NEW COURSE, NEW EQUIPMENT,

329
00:12:56,607 --> 00:12:58,976
AND A BRAND-NEW GAME
WE CALL MAXI GOLF.

330
00:13:00,077 --> 00:13:01,278
MAXI GOLF?

331
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:03,714
MINI GOLF IS OUT,
MAXI GOLF IS IN, HAROLD.

332
00:13:03,714 --> 00:13:06,417
BIG HOLES, BIG CLUBS,
BIG BALLS.

333
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,453
(Audience laughing)

334
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:21,465
(Siren)

335
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:23,601
(Siren stops)

336
00:13:25,002 --> 00:13:28,372
POSSUM 911 -- WHAT'S YOUR
NAME AND MEMBERSHIP NUMBER?

337
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,574
UH, MY NAME'S DAVE.

338
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:32,042
MY NUMBER IS 4--

339
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:34,979
OH, 5-6-7-9-2.

340
00:13:34,979 --> 00:13:36,147
OKAY, JUST HOLD ON DAVE,

341
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:38,182
WE'RE GONNA INSERT THAT
INTO THE POSSUM LODGE COMPUTER

342
00:13:38,182 --> 00:13:39,617
TO VERIFY YOUR MEMBERSHIP.

343
00:13:39,683 --> 00:13:40,518
YEAH.

344
00:13:41,085 --> 00:13:44,522
(Clacking pliers)

345
00:13:44,688 --> 00:13:47,725
OH, DAVE, YOU'RE BEHIND
IN YOUR DUES, AREN'T YOU?

346
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:49,160
UH...

347
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,428
IT'S IN THE MAIL.

348
00:13:51,562 --> 00:13:54,198
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME, DAVE --
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

349
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:56,667
RED, I'VE GOT A REAL EMERGENCY
HAPPENING HERE.

350
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:58,869
WE'RE LOOKING TO BUY
A NEW VEHICLE

351
00:13:58,936 --> 00:14:02,106
AND SHE WANTS TO BUY --
OH, GOSH -- A MINIVAN.

352
00:14:02,306 --> 00:14:04,241
OHHH, MAN!

353
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,744
THAT'S A TOUGH ONE, DAVE.

354
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,513
A MINIVAN, RED --
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

355
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,515
I REALLY DON'T SEE THE PROBLEM.

356
00:14:11,515 --> 00:14:13,751
I THINK THEY'RE SPORTY
AND SHARP AND FUEL-EFFICIENT.

357
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:15,519
THEY’RE PRACTICAL, I WISH I HAD ONE!

358
00:14:15,886 --> 00:14:17,321
YEAH, SEE, RED?

359
00:14:17,488 --> 00:14:19,423
I DON'T WANT TO END UP
LIKE HAROLD.

360
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:20,557
NO, NO, NO.

361
00:14:21,392 --> 00:14:22,993
I'M WITH YOU, THERE, DAVE.

362
00:14:22,993 --> 00:14:24,461
I’LL TELL YOU SOMETHING THOUGH,

363
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:26,563
A MINIVAN MAY SEEM
ON THE FEMININE SIDE

364
00:14:26,764 --> 00:14:28,332
BUT YOU CAN DRESS 'EM UP, DAVE.

365
00:14:28,332 --> 00:14:31,068
YOU CAN GET THE MASCULINE
ACCESSORIES ON THAT.

366
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:32,403
THAT'S TRUE.

367
00:14:32,469 --> 00:14:33,537
JUST BE CAREFUL, YOU KNOW?

368
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:36,340
DON'T GET BAD STUFF,
LIKE THOSE CUSTOM WHEEL COVERS.

369
00:14:36,573 --> 00:14:38,309
THEY'RE GAUDY, THEY REALLY ARE.

370
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:41,845
OR THOSE TACKY MUD-FLAPS WITH
SILHOUETTES OF NAKED LADIES.

371
00:14:42,212 --> 00:14:44,581
THERE'S NO RESPECT
FOR THE FEMININE PERSONAGES

372
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:45,949
BY DOING THAT.

373
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,053
OR PEOPLE PUT THOSE NEON LIGHTS
UNDERNEATH THE VEHICLE!

374
00:14:49,053 --> 00:14:50,354
WHAT'S GOIN' ON THERE?

375
00:14:50,354 --> 00:14:51,622
THAT'S A WASTE OF ENERGY.

376
00:14:51,622 --> 00:14:53,624
A WASTE OF EN-ER-GY!

377
00:14:54,124 --> 00:14:55,592
IF YOU'RE LOOKING
AT THE GROUND,

378
00:14:55,592 --> 00:14:57,327
YOU'RE NOT WATCHING THE ROAD!

379
00:14:57,861 --> 00:15:00,464
THEY GOT THESE AIR-HORNS --
SOUND LIKE THEY STOLE THEM

380
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:02,366
OFF A DIESEL TRAIN
OR SOMETHING.

381
00:15:02,566 --> 00:15:03,734
AND THOSE MUFFLERS GO...

382
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:05,803
(Imitating loud muffler)

383
00:15:06,136 --> 00:15:08,072
I THINK LIKE A BAND OF DRUMMERS
ARE COMING AT ME.

384
00:15:08,138 --> 00:15:09,973
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT'S ABOUT.

385
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,309
THEY GOT THESE MUD-FLAPS
AND FENDER SKIRTS

386
00:15:12,376 --> 00:15:13,644
AND RUNNING BOARDS.

387
00:15:13,644 --> 00:15:14,545
RUNNING BOARDS?

388
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:15,712
I TRIED RUNNING.

389
00:15:15,712 --> 00:15:17,247
YOU CAN'T GET ANY SPEED AT ALL.

390
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:20,818
KEEP RUNNING OFF THE THING.

391
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:23,787
AND THEN YOU GOT THOSE TAILPIPE
EXTENSIONS -- COME ON!

392
00:15:23,787 --> 00:15:25,289
DID YOU GET ALL THAT, DAVE?

393
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:26,957
WHAT WAS THE LAST ONE?

394
00:15:27,191 --> 00:15:28,459
TAILPIPE EXTENSIONS.

395
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:29,960
YES, UH, THANKS.

396
00:15:30,127 --> 00:15:32,095
I HOPE WE CAN AFFORD ALL THIS.

397
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:38,268
(Laughing and applause)

398
00:15:39,303 --> 00:15:41,872
(Red): ALL RIGHT,
IT'S GLASS-BLOWING TIME,

399
00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:43,707
"ADVENTURES WITH BILL", HERE.

400
00:15:43,774 --> 00:15:45,609
PUT THE GLASS INTO THE--

401
00:15:45,676 --> 00:15:47,110
PUT THE GLASS--

402
00:15:47,177 --> 00:15:48,545
THAT'S NOT GLASS.

403
00:15:48,612 --> 00:15:50,714
THESE ARE PLASTIC ITEMS, BILL.

404
00:15:50,848 --> 00:15:52,349
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

405
00:15:53,817 --> 00:15:57,054
I GUESS HE DECIDED
TO ABANDON THE GLASS THING.

406
00:15:57,187 --> 00:15:58,689
HE'S GONNA BLOW PLASTIC.

407
00:15:58,689 --> 00:15:59,957
THAT'S KIND OF UNUSUAL.

408
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:01,525
ALL KINDS OF PLASTIC--

409
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:03,093
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

410
00:16:03,093 --> 00:16:04,761
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

411
00:16:05,395 --> 00:16:07,764
MELT ALL THE PLASTIC TOGETHER
AND MAKE A BIG GOOPY--

412
00:16:07,764 --> 00:16:09,199
OHHH!

413
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,635
MAKE A BIG GOOPY THING, THERE.

414
00:16:11,702 --> 00:16:13,203
GOLLY, TAKE A GOOD--

415
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,571
WOW! I'M TELLING YOU!

416
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:18,375
HOLY MACKEREL, THAT WILL
SET YOU BACK A COUPLE OF YEARS.

417
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,646
BOY, OH, BOY, , , BOY, OH, BOY!

418
00:16:22,713 --> 00:16:24,414
IT'S CHEAPER THAN
A CASE OF BEER, I’LL TELL YA.

419
00:16:24,414 --> 00:16:26,483
UP SHE COMES --
WHAT THE HECK WE GOT THERE?

420
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,720
WOW! HE LOOKS GOOD WITH A PIPE.

421
00:16:29,786 --> 00:16:32,689
WHOA! AND THERE WE GO,
AND THEN, SEE,

422
00:16:32,689 --> 00:16:34,691
THAT IS JUST A PIECE
OF COPPER PIPING.

423
00:16:34,691 --> 00:16:37,260
GETS A BALL OF THE GOOP
ON THE END.

424
00:16:37,294 --> 00:16:38,929
HE SWIRLS THAT SO IT SEALS UP.

425
00:16:39,062 --> 00:16:40,497
THEN HE CAN BLOW IT.

426
00:16:41,164 --> 00:16:43,433
I GUESS THIS IS THE MODERN
VERSION OF GLASS BLOWING.

427
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:45,235
YOU'RE BLOWING THE PLASTIC.

428
00:16:45,335 --> 00:16:47,104
GOT ALL THE CARCINOGENS,
BLOWING THEM UP.

429
00:16:48,572 --> 00:16:50,173
BILL, I THINK THAT MIGHT BE...

430
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:51,608
BILL, THINK THAT MIGHT--

431
00:16:51,675 --> 00:16:53,210
BILL, I'M THINKIN'-- BILL!

432
00:16:53,276 --> 00:16:54,544
BILL, I'M THINKIN'...

433
00:16:54,611 --> 00:16:55,946
I'M THINKIN'
SEE YOU LATER, BILL.

434
00:16:55,946 --> 00:16:57,447
THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKIN'.

435
00:16:57,647 --> 00:17:00,484
BY GOLLY, WOULDN'T THAT BE
EIGHT FEET ACROSS?

436
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:04,221
IT'S GONNA GO-- NO, NO, NO, NO!

437
00:17:04,354 --> 00:17:06,156
(Bill): OHHHHHH!

438
00:17:06,156 --> 00:17:07,591
AHHHHHH!

439
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:09,426
(Thud) OHHHH!

440
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:10,861
(Red): TOLD YOU.

441
00:17:10,861 --> 00:17:14,297
THERE'S BILL,
A VENEER OF HIS FORMER SELF.

442
00:17:14,664 --> 00:17:16,967
EITHER THAT, OR HE'S PLASTERED.

443
00:17:16,967 --> 00:17:18,468
YOU OK, BILL?

444
00:17:19,336 --> 00:17:20,103
(Smack)

445
00:17:20,103 --> 00:17:21,471
AHHHH!

446
00:17:22,172 --> 00:17:24,474
(Red): HERE'S A PAIR
OF POSSUM LODGE BINOCULARS

447
00:17:24,474 --> 00:17:25,909
SENT TO US BY A VIEWER.

448
00:17:29,546 --> 00:17:32,182
(Audience laughing)

449
00:17:34,084 --> 00:17:35,752
WELL, WE'RE ABOUT
READY TO TEE OFF

450
00:17:35,752 --> 00:17:38,388
FOR THE FIRST POSSUM LODGE
MAXI GOLF TOURNAMENT.

451
00:17:38,455 --> 00:17:39,289
YOU WANT TO BE

452
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:40,557
IN MY FOURSOME,
HAROLD?

453
00:17:40,724 --> 00:17:42,125
MAYBE, IS THAT THE TROPHY?

454
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,560
WHO WOULD WANT
TO WIN THAT?

455
00:17:44,461 --> 00:17:45,529
IT'S NOT A TROPHY, HAROLD.

456
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:47,430
THAT'S OUR GOLF TEE.

457
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,266
(Audience laughing)

458
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,569
IF THAT'S THE TEE,
HOW BIG IS THIS MAXI GOLF BALL?

459
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:53,970
PRETTY DARNED MAXI.

460
00:17:54,104 --> 00:17:57,140
YOU KNOW THAT BIG BRASS BALL
THEY GOT PAINTED LIKE JUPITER,

461
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,075
HANGS OVER THE ENTRANCE
OF THE JUPITER DRIVE-IN?

462
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,344
IT'S NOT THERE ANY MORE.

463
00:18:02,245 --> 00:18:03,780
THAT THING'S, LIKE,
SIX FEET ACROSS.

464
00:18:04,114 --> 00:18:05,081
YOU'RE GONNA NEED, LIKE,

465
00:18:05,148 --> 00:18:07,017
HOLES 7 FEET ACROSS,
10 FEET DEEP.

466
00:18:07,017 --> 00:18:08,652
WHERE WILL YOU FIND
18 OF THOSE?

467
00:18:08,652 --> 00:18:10,553
THE POT-HOLES ON THE ROAD
INTO TOWN.

468
00:18:11,054 --> 00:18:12,856
OH, YEAH, HE'S RIGHT.
THAT’S RIGHT,

469
00:18:12,856 --> 00:18:13,823
YOU COULD
DO THAT.

470
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,292
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA USE

471
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:16,293
TO HIT 'EM WITH?

472
00:18:16,293 --> 00:18:17,694
IT'S NOT A REGULAR GOLF BALL.

473
00:18:17,694 --> 00:18:19,629
IT'S LIKE A... A PLANET!

474
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:22,732
MY BIG BLUE EIGHT-IRON, HAROLD.

475
00:18:22,966 --> 00:18:24,234
THE POSSUM VAN.

476
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,503
OHHH!

477
00:18:26,569 --> 00:18:29,506
BIG, BLUE, IT'S A V-8
AND IT'S MADE OF IRON.

478
00:18:29,572 --> 00:18:32,409
AND A HUGE SWEET SPOT --
THE WHOLE FRONT GRILLE.

479
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:34,411
TALK ABOUT DRIVING THE BALL,
EH, HAROLD?

480
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:35,712
(Audience laughing)

481
00:18:37,414 --> 00:18:39,349
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT PORTION
OF THE SHOW!

482
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:41,117
WHERE WE EXAMINE
THOSE THREE LITTLE WORDS

483
00:18:41,184 --> 00:18:42,919
THAT MEN FIND
SO DIFFICULT TO SAY....

484
00:18:43,153 --> 00:18:45,088
(Audience):
"I DON'T KNOW!"

485
00:18:45,522 --> 00:18:46,389
NEITHER DO THEY!

486
00:18:46,489 --> 00:18:49,626
OK, ON THIS WEEK'S EXPERT PORTION,
WE HAVE GUESTS.

487
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:51,127
MY UNCLE RED, NATCH,

488
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:53,296
AND HIS BEST FRIEND
IN THE WHOLE ROOM,

489
00:18:54,597 --> 00:18:56,466
PILOT BUZZ SHERWOOD!

490
00:18:56,466 --> 00:18:58,668
(Applause and cheering)

491
00:18:58,668 --> 00:19:00,103
OK.

492
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,172
(Cheering and whistling)

493
00:19:02,172 --> 00:19:04,174
THIS VIEWER WRITES,
"DEAR EXPERTS,

494
00:19:04,174 --> 00:19:05,542
"I'M FED UP WITH CRIME.

495
00:19:05,575 --> 00:19:07,911
"I'M THINKING OF MOVING FROM
THE CITY TO POSSUM LAKE.”

496
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:10,079
"IS THERE MUCH CRIME
WHERE YOU ARE?"

497
00:19:10,113 --> 00:19:11,514
AHHH -- GOOD QUESTION.

498
00:19:12,048 --> 00:19:15,418
THERE'S NO CRIME UP HERE,
UNLESS BORROWING SOMETHING

499
00:19:15,485 --> 00:19:18,154
AND NEVER GIVING IT BACK
IS CALLED THEFT.

500
00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:20,423
(Buzz): WELL... I KNOW

501
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,626
SOME OF THE WARDROBE CHOICES
UP HERE BORDER ON THE CRIMINAL.

502
00:19:23,626 --> 00:19:25,562
(Laughing)

503
00:19:26,896 --> 00:19:31,601
YEAH, YOUR OUTFIT COULD GET
A TICKET FOR LITTERING.

504
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:36,039
YEAH, WELL, YOURS WOULD GET ONE
FOR... LOITERING!

505
00:19:36,105 --> 00:19:37,740
(Laughing)

506
00:19:37,807 --> 00:19:40,510
OK, ABOUT THIS LADY'S QUESTION,
THOUGH...

507
00:19:40,577 --> 00:19:42,178
LET'S JUST SAY, MA'AM,

508
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:45,715
THAT NOBODY HERE WOULD BE ON
"AMERICA'S MOST WANTED".

509
00:19:45,715 --> 00:19:48,484
MAYBE "AMERICA'S MOST WASTED".

510
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:50,320
"AMERICA'S"...

511
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,754
UH, "AMERICA'S
MOST" WHAT?

512
00:19:51,854 --> 00:19:53,890
WANTED.
"AMERICA'S
MOST WANTED".

513
00:19:53,923 --> 00:19:55,892
YOU DON'T WATCH TELEVISION,
MR. SHERWOOD?

514
00:19:56,025 --> 00:19:58,127
NOT SINCE "THE MOD SQUAD", MAN.

515
00:19:58,194 --> 00:19:59,529
(Audience laughing)

516
00:20:00,163 --> 00:20:02,899
WELL, "AMERICA'S MOST WANTED",
IT'S A TELEVISION SHOW.

517
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:06,536
IT SHOWS UNSOLVED CRIMES FROM
5, 10, EVEN 20 YEARS AGO.

518
00:20:06,703 --> 00:20:09,839
ACTORS PLAY THE CRIMINALS,
WHICH ISN'T A STRETCH.

519
00:20:09,906 --> 00:20:10,940
20 MILLION BUCKS

520
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,742
FOR "CABLE GUY"? PLEASE!

521
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:14,577
THEY SHOW SUSPECTS' PICTURES.

522
00:20:14,644 --> 00:20:17,013
THEY ALWAYS LOOK LIKE MOOSE THOMPSON'S
DRIVER'S LICENSE PHOTO.

523
00:20:17,013 --> 00:20:17,780
YOU EVER NOTICE THAT?

524
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,082
LOOKS JUST LIKE MOOSE THOMPSON'S
DRIVER'S LICENSE PHOTO.

525
00:20:19,749 --> 00:20:21,117
ROBERT STACK'S THE HOST.

526
00:20:21,117 --> 00:20:22,985
HE DID "THE UNTOUCHABLES"
AND NOTHING SINCE.

527
00:20:23,186 --> 00:20:26,089
HE SAYS, "DO YOU RECOGNIZE
THIS FACE?

528
00:20:26,122 --> 00:20:27,757
"DOES THIS PERSON
LOOK FAMILIAR?

529
00:20:27,757 --> 00:20:28,825
"IF SO, PHONE IN NOW."

530
00:20:28,825 --> 00:20:31,260
EVERYBODY AT HOME GOES,
"MY GOD, I KNOW HIM!"

531
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,295
"THAT MY STEPFATHER."

532
00:20:32,295 --> 00:20:33,696
"THAT GUY SITS RIGHT
BESIDE ME AT WORK."

533
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,899
AND THEY PHONE IN AND SAY,
"HELLO, ROBERT STACK?

534
00:20:36,966 --> 00:20:38,968
"THE GUY'S HERE --
COME AND GET HIM!"

535
00:20:39,068 --> 00:20:42,071
(Audience laughing)

536
00:20:42,071 --> 00:20:45,041
(Applause)

537
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:47,143
THAT'S "AMERICA'S
MOST WANTED".

538
00:20:47,143 --> 00:20:48,411
YOU NEVER SEEN THAT?

539
00:20:48,478 --> 00:20:49,746
WHAT? WHAT?

540
00:20:49,846 --> 00:20:52,281
WHAT? WHAT? WHAT?

541
00:20:52,281 --> 00:20:57,220
(Audience laughing)

542
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,388
SHOULD WE PHONE
ROBERT STACK?

543
00:20:59,555 --> 00:21:02,558
(Laughing)

544
00:21:07,763 --> 00:21:12,001
(Whimpering)

545
00:21:12,068 --> 00:21:13,069
AHHHH!

546
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:14,504
EXCUSE ME, HAROLD.

547
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:18,374
WELL, GOTTA TELL YA,
OUR GAME OF MAXI GOLF

548
00:21:18,407 --> 00:21:20,109
WAS A BIG, BIG HIT.

549
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:22,144
I GOT HIT
BY THE BALL!

550
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:23,646
YEAH, BIG, BIG HIT.

551
00:21:25,214 --> 00:21:27,116
WELL HAROLD, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN ON THE FAIRWAY.

552
00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:29,151
I WAS STANDING IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE ROAD!

553
00:21:29,218 --> 00:21:31,220
I WAS WALKING
AHEAD OF YOU GUYS.

554
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:33,689
WE WERE PLAYING THROUGH,
HAROLD.

555
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:35,458
BESIDES, THIS MAKES YOU LOOK
LIKE A REAL GOLFER.

556
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,193
YOU GOT A DOG-LEG LEFT.

557
00:21:39,128 --> 00:21:41,530
WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE YELLED "FORE!"

558
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,100
IT WAS A CHRYSLER --
I SHOULD HAVE YELLED "DODGE!"

559
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:45,668
(Laughing)

560
00:21:46,102 --> 00:21:47,536
YEAH, BY GOLLY.

561
00:21:47,603 --> 00:21:49,538
WHAT A GREAT GAME, BOY!

562
00:21:49,605 --> 00:21:51,440
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

563
00:21:51,574 --> 00:21:53,009
(Laughing)

564
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:56,445
MAN, OH, MAN, THE BUNCH OF US,
DRIVING OUR CARS,

565
00:21:56,512 --> 00:21:57,847
BASHING INTO THAT BALL.

566
00:21:57,913 --> 00:22:00,583
JUNIOR SINGLETON NEEDS
A FRONT-END ALIGNMENT.

567
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:03,285
HE WHIFFED ON ONE SHOT, ROLLED
HIS TRUCK INTO THE RAVINE.

568
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:05,187
(Laughing)

569
00:22:05,388 --> 00:22:07,823
TALK ABOUT
YOUR BAD LIES.

570
00:22:07,823 --> 00:22:09,492
WAIT TIL YOU HEAR THE ONES
HE TELLS HIS WIFE!

571
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:11,293
(Possum squeal)

572
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,828
MEETING TIME,
UNCLE RED.

573
00:22:12,895 --> 00:22:14,196
SQUEAL
OF THE POSSUM.

574
00:22:14,263 --> 00:22:15,531
AWAY YOU GO, HAROLD.

575
00:22:15,598 --> 00:22:16,866
OH, BOY.

576
00:22:16,932 --> 00:22:18,200
(Audience laughing)

577
00:22:18,267 --> 00:22:19,402
WELL...

579
00:22:22,071 --> 00:22:25,074
(Laughing)

580
00:22:25,141 --> 00:22:28,511
(Applause)

581
00:22:28,844 --> 00:22:30,346
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

582
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:31,580
I’LL BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

583
00:22:31,647 --> 00:22:33,983
I KNOW YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
A REAL BIG FAN OF GOLF,

584
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:37,153
BUT I WAS HOPING MAYBE LATER
WE COULD PLAY "A ROUND"...

585
00:22:38,721 --> 00:22:41,157
UNLESS YOU'RE TEED OFF!

586
00:22:41,557 --> 00:22:43,159
THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

587
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:45,428

591
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,346
