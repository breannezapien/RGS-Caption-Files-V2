1
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,510
The Book of Genesis says that God created
heaven and Earth in seven days.

2
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,981
Well, every seven days we move heaven and
Earth to bring you the greatest show in the

3
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:51,284
history of the universe, you know?

4
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:54,521
But we're only mortals, so this is the
result, basically.

5
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:59,459
But, you know, considering the budget and
the talent, it's not bad when here he is the

6
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,060
most, not baddest guy of them all.

7
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,296
The star of the Red Green Show and my uncle.

8
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,031
Thanks so very much, ladies and gentlemen,
Mr.

9
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:06,833
Red Green.

10
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:12,639
Thank you, Harold. Thank you and welcome to
Possum Lodge.

11
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,408
Harold, I notice you have kind of a biblical
theme going there.

12
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:20,246
Yes, I do. And it's all leading up to some
nifty creations from my miracle box here.

13
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:24,584
That was a miracle, wasn't it?

14
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:26,619
Go ahead. I don't think so, Harold.

15
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,221
Miracles tend to be kind of good things.

16
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:31,324
I would put this in in the category of
pestilence and famine.

17
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:34,627
Well, we had a great week up at the launch.

18
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:39,265
We had the we had the Possum Lake Regatta
going here, which is a huge boat race is open

19
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,134
to all, all classes, all links and
everything.

20
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:46,939
We probably had about forty five sailboats,
I guess, on the lake from from possum lodges

21
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:51,177
all over North America vying for the coveted
Windy Possum Trophy.

22
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,714
I'll tell you, I haven't seen that much
canvas flapping in the breeze since they

23
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,149
serve chili at the toga party.

24
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,318
But you know, I'll tell you, we wanted a
game.

25
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,958
Moose Thompson and Stinky Peterson came in
first place and defended our unbeaten winning

26
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,160
streak of one.

27
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:09,996
Oh yeah, that was quite an accomplishment.

28
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:13,766
They won by taking the lodge water skiing
towboat that had like a four hundred

29
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,334
horsepower outboard on it.

30
00:02:16,335 --> 00:02:17,770
Yeah. All right. Well, we just have a few
complaints.

31
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,906
But hey, a loophole is a loophole.

32
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,308
You may have to tighten up the rules for
next year.

33
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:25,912
And once you eliminate powerboats, you might
also want to consider taking out like

34
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:29,449
boarding parties and shooting flares in the
competition sales.

35
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:31,317
Well, what do you have left here?

36
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,719
Just a bunch of sailboats racing against
each other.

37
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,289
Uncle Red Yachting is not a contact sport.

38
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:38,024
Well, then we've improved it.

39
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,994
Anyway, the guy has really, really enjoyed
that regard, and we did well and everything

40
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:46,699
except whitewater rafting, finance, stalking
and sportsmanship.

41
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,702
But I'll tell you about that a little later
in the show.

42
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,042
That was a cue laser face.

43
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,710
Oh, sorry, I was drifting off, I'm back.

44
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:15,127
Well, I'm thinking I'm thinking, Harold, you
get any sixes, goldfish.

45
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,898
Bill William have any five.

46
00:03:34,146 --> 00:03:37,516
No, no, no.

47
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,152
This game's getting too rich for me.

48
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:41,987
I think I'll go for a ride in the RV.

49
00:03:42,688 --> 00:03:46,892
Anybody interested they might want to come
along over a little burn in the car and

50
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:48,961
Kirby, who's up for it, huh?

51
00:03:49,795 --> 00:03:51,097
A lot of fun. Who's there?

52
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,166
Who's coming, hero bill?

53
00:03:54,366 --> 00:03:56,102
Go ahead, Billy.

54
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:57,369
Come on. You want to go for a little run?

55
00:03:57,369 --> 00:03:59,572
Don't read. I know you're always ready for
it.

56
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,442
Well, actually, it's a date. So what's the
date?

57
00:04:03,642 --> 00:04:05,511
Oh, yeah. Well, that's today's the day I go
by myself.

58
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:08,481
I got I give her a little solo burn, do a
little lone wolf thing, you know, that kind

59
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:11,417
of thing. But you guys have a little fun
playing your little card game here.

60
00:04:12,184 --> 00:04:14,053
Douglas, I'll go for a ride in the RV.

61
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,388
No, you can't come.

62
00:04:16,388 --> 00:04:18,023
Anyway, I guess.

63
00:04:18,023 --> 00:04:19,091
Would you like to play fish?

64
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:22,661
I don't gamble, which is more than I can say
for a helmet.

65
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:23,729
Here what?

66
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,631
I just saw the canoe.

67
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:26,298
Oh yeah.

68
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,535
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

69
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:34,874
You turned a piece of large equipment into
scrap metal and you say, sorry,

70
00:04:35,574 --> 00:04:38,611
I wanted to go whitewater rafting and we
don't have a raft, so I took

71
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,880
The canoe. Now we don't have a canoe.

72
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,715
What did you do? Go through a hydroelectric
plant?

73
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:45,885
You've got hydroelectric plant.

74
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:47,119
Stuff happens.

75
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,921
Yes, it does.

76
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:52,391
Stuff happens and then stuff gets replaced.

77
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:57,463
Now you weren't going to buy us a new canoe
and you are forbidden for three months to use

78
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,699
any large equipment and you have to have a
bath and a shave.

79
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:04,303
I don't like your tone.

80
00:05:06,171 --> 00:05:09,341
You know, Douglas, lots of us damp boats and
stuff from time to time.

81
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,809
Oh yeah, yeah. Red.

82
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:13,279
This is not dented. It's shredded, it's
mangled.

83
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,248
I would have thought you'd been happy that I
was alive.

84
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:20,552
I am. It would take a lot longer to sue your
estate for damages.

85
00:05:20,786 --> 00:05:23,656
No, I'm giving you twenty four hours to come
up with the money.

86
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:35,067
And picking apples, picking apples down at
Nash's farm, I climb up the highest branch, I

87
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:36,802
get a spartan and a broken arm,

88
00:05:38,203 --> 00:05:41,974
An apple to apples to apples

89
00:05:42,441 --> 00:05:43,809
For apples. Five.

90
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:47,146
I never knew he's going to get that many
apples and your mouse will still be alive.

91
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,381
Eating up, seeing apples.

92
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:51,350
Something from every tree.

93
00:05:51,683 --> 00:05:54,186
The neighbor yells, Hey, those apples have
worms.

94
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,021
It's OK. So do we.

95
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:11,370
This week in Handyman Garner, I'm going to
show you how you could make do and just use

96
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,707
what you have. For example, I was I was
going through town the other day and I saw a

97
00:06:15,707 --> 00:06:19,945
whole bunch of these blue boxes out in front
of people's houses filled up with tin cans

98
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:21,680
and they're just lying there, you know?

99
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:22,948
They just made my head spin.

100
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,751
And of course, I've seen that many tin cans
in my mind.

101
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:28,654
I got the kind of mine that just starts
rolling around with the ideas.

102
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:32,691
The first one being to just grab off the
boxes of cans and throw them into the van.

103
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:33,926
You know, nobody, nobody to stop me or
nothing.

104
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:40,699
And I got, I would say, maybe 50 or 60 of
the boxes and probably around 8000 cans, you

105
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:44,536
know? So I thought we can show you what you
can do with stuff like that.

106
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:52,945
Now, save the boxes for next week, we're
going to show you how to make a pontoon boat.

107
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:59,885
But this week we're going to show you what
you can do with the cans.

108
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:05,958
Ok, now I mean, there's the all the obvious
stuff, you know, ashtrays, drinking cups,

109
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:13,899
soap dishes, jewelry boxes, eyeglass frames
say a change purse or safety boots or even

110
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:18,804
portable urinals. But I'd like to
concentrate on some multicam projects you can

111
00:07:18,804 --> 00:07:24,476
do using the handyman secret weapon duct
tape.

112
00:07:25,043 --> 00:07:26,545
Ok, so we've got a bit of this off.

113
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:29,614
Stick it down. Sticky side up, sticky side
up.

114
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:30,849
Some important lesson in life.

115
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:33,418
Take two cans roughly of the same size.

116
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:41,226
You joining them together. Like so and just
roll it onto the onto the duct tape at the

117
00:07:41,693 --> 00:07:43,695
going rate on the duct tape is fantastic.

118
00:07:43,695 --> 00:07:51,603
You can glue anything with that little glue,
wouldn't the plastic or metal type glass or

119
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:53,572
doors to cars?

120
00:07:54,806 --> 00:07:57,576
Let's repeat this process with a third can
of added on here.

121
00:07:57,609 --> 00:08:02,647
And you know, I wouldn't be surprised if you
could glue putting the air with duct tape.

122
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:08,353
Wouldn't that be something big dollop of
butterscotch pudding just hanging in your

123
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:12,224
foyer? To see your mom come on in.

124
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:15,994
Ok, there we go.

125
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:19,564
You're right. It's a chair leg.

126
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:24,936
Ok, now we need a seat for our chairs.

127
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,440
Put down a strip of duct tape again.

128
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:35,680
The sticky side up that'll get you through
so much of your adult life that down there

129
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,884
like that. And then you take the cans, you
know, duct tape sticks well, two fingers do

130
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,789
and put the cans on the tape just a couple
inches apart.

131
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:46,424
Just slap my like that.

132
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,528
Now these are cans of approximately the same
size, but they're again.

133
00:08:50,762 --> 00:08:58,269
Get creative. Once you've done that, you
just grab the end of the tape and you start

134
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:05,610
rolling her up. Oh, I bet every one of these
cans could the cow story.

135
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:07,746
I mean, the cans could talk.

136
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,948
Life's funny like that, isn't it?

137
00:09:11,182 --> 00:09:12,484
I don't know if you'd want cans to be
talking.

138
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:15,720
You know what would can say about you.

139
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,624
Do you like if cans could actually talk?

140
00:09:19,758 --> 00:09:26,498
You bring that up, bring that around and
there's a seat for your chair.

141
00:09:26,531 --> 00:09:28,967
Mind you, you're going to want a small can
sit on that.

142
00:09:32,003 --> 00:09:33,104
And there you have it.

143
00:09:33,304 --> 00:09:34,839
Who says it's hard to make furniture?

144
00:09:35,774 --> 00:09:37,609
That's not an attractive aluminum on chair.

145
00:09:38,276 --> 00:09:41,246
Just picture yourself sitting out on that in
the sun.

146
00:09:41,246 --> 00:09:44,149
And after you have a few drinks, you got
enough cans and make yourself a footstool.

147
00:09:46,284 --> 00:09:49,754
No know something else you can make of tin
cans for the kids.

148
00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:55,126
I'll tell you. You get the sound of the
youngster and you have them roller skating on

149
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:58,196
any kind of a concrete surface, and the
noise level gets to the point where you got

150
00:09:58,196 --> 00:09:59,531
to talk to them with the sign language
there.

151
00:10:00,632 --> 00:10:03,835
But on the other hand, you know, you always
know where your kids are.

152
00:10:04,002 --> 00:10:08,473
I mean, if that's important to you and say
what we're talking about here is really

153
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:14,913
imagination, you know that that English
writer Samuel Johnson, the one time, said if

154
00:10:14,913 --> 00:10:19,017
it wasn't for imagination, the man would be
just as happy in the arms of a chambermaid as

155
00:10:19,017 --> 00:10:20,451
he as he wasn't a duchess.

156
00:10:21,452 --> 00:10:26,925
He's dead now, but no, I'm just trying to
use my imagination, and I'm imagining that we

157
00:10:26,925 --> 00:10:30,395
take these tin cans and make ourselves an
Easter off, huh?

158
00:10:31,095 --> 00:10:34,098
So we take a count like this and we just cut
the Canada down.

159
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,474
All right, that's not going just quite as
well as I planned, so why don't we switch

160
00:10:43,474 --> 00:10:45,677
over to the handy man's favorite power
tools?

161
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:57,088
And all right.

162
00:10:58,690 --> 00:10:59,824
Ten snaps, huh?

163
00:11:02,593 --> 00:11:03,428
Right through these.

164
00:11:07,865 --> 00:11:08,299
So.

165
00:11:13,705 --> 00:11:15,606
It's just a matter of using your imagination.

166
00:11:15,907 --> 00:11:19,911
It's like Samuel Johnson said, the Lord
Chesterfield, if the women don't find it

167
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:21,579
handsome, they should at least find a handy.

168
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:25,249
He was horsing around with Lady Chesterfield
at the time.

169
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:28,252
Now reports have an interesting life on me.

170
00:11:29,587 --> 00:11:30,354
Let's get rid of all.

171
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:45,303
Oh, excuse me a minute.

172
00:11:52,477 --> 00:11:54,278
Everything you touch, you reckon?

173
00:11:54,545 --> 00:11:55,446
I do not.

174
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:13,030
It is summer, the dog lies motionless on my
front porch.

175
00:12:13,831 --> 00:12:18,736
This is strange because I don't have a dog,
nor do I have a front porch.

176
00:12:20,238 --> 00:12:22,273
Obviously, one of us is not home.

177
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:32,917
I tell you this whole situation with helmet
in the crumpled canoe has got the whole lodge

178
00:12:33,017 --> 00:12:36,887
buzzing, you know, because if Douglas pushes
this too far, it could set a real dangerous

179
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:41,192
precedent where people would actually be
held responsible for things they wrecked.

180
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:44,295
Well, I don't know. I think maybe people
should be responsible for their own

181
00:12:44,295 --> 00:12:48,666
abilities, and these self-appointed experts
are dangerous.

182
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,401
I say more power than dogs.

183
00:12:51,335 --> 00:12:55,239
For example, the producer and director of the
show would be held accountable for the look

184
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:58,743
and the pace. And of course, the audience
ratings what?

185
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:05,616
What I do the best with the talent available.

186
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,685
We can just replace you with some of the more
talented.

187
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,855
Ok. All right. You know what?

188
00:13:11,055 --> 00:13:14,125
You know what? I think I think that people
like Douglas should be held accountable for

189
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,926
the lack of money in the large Treasury.

190
00:13:16,694 --> 00:13:17,862
How about that? Yeah, yeah.

191
00:13:17,895 --> 00:13:19,063
I thought you'd come around, Harold.

192
00:13:19,096 --> 00:13:20,664
Yeah. Ok, here's what I think.

193
00:13:21,065 --> 00:13:22,900
I think what you could do is we should

194
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,335
Sorry, Uncle Ray. There's no time for that.

195
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:26,771
Not if I'm in control the pace of the show
and everything got to go.

196
00:13:38,115 --> 00:13:41,585
Glenn Land, hello.

197
00:13:43,454 --> 00:13:46,257
Wow. Oh, no, that's not me, right?

198
00:13:46,624 --> 00:13:49,994
It's me here. That's just a little decoy I
raked up.

199
00:13:49,994 --> 00:13:51,428
Keep the looters away from the RV.

200
00:13:52,229 --> 00:13:53,864
Yeah, it's kind of a scarecrow thing, you
know?

201
00:13:54,398 --> 00:13:54,865
Yeah, yeah.

202
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:55,900
Looks just like me.

203
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,968
Don't it doesn't even move.

204
00:13:58,068 --> 00:14:01,805
Perfect, man. Can you fix a canoe?

205
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,477
Well, see for your large brother and all
that.

206
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:09,280
Yeah, yeah. I'll have to charge you 10 bucks
for the estimate.

207
00:14:10,848 --> 00:14:12,182
All right. Yeah. All right. Monday.

208
00:14:12,182 --> 00:14:12,650
Look, see

209
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:13,751
Already.

210
00:14:21,325 --> 00:14:22,192
Now what do you think?

211
00:14:23,093 --> 00:14:23,761
Or is a canoe?

212
00:14:25,095 --> 00:14:25,863
This is it right here.

213
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:29,967
It's been going over the falls again.

214
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:34,405
Yeah, yeah. Boy, he must know everything
there is to know about gravity.

215
00:14:34,405 --> 00:14:37,508
Huh? Can you fix it, man?

216
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:39,176
Oh no, this is a write off read.

217
00:14:39,543 --> 00:14:41,211
Yeah, you might be a fly in an art gallery
or something.

218
00:14:41,211 --> 00:14:42,279
Might be interested, but

219
00:14:44,281 --> 00:14:46,050
Oh, that's too bad.

220
00:14:46,483 --> 00:14:49,586
Yeah. Well, that'll be 10 bucks read.

221
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:52,456
Yeah. Yeah. Say Glen.

222
00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:56,894
You know, instead of any of the 10, you
think I could do something, you know, maybe

223
00:14:56,894 --> 00:14:59,630
clean up the RV or something rather than
cash, you know?

224
00:14:59,663 --> 00:15:03,700
Well, you know what? Yeah, actually, she
needs an oil change grid, so maybe you just

225
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,302
jump under there? Yeah, pull out the oil
plug.

226
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:08,872
Yeah, let it drain into the lake, though,
because it makes a hell of a mess right here.

227
00:15:08,972 --> 00:15:10,407
Oh yeah. All right. And I'll cook it
tomorrow.

228
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:13,710
That's a good idea, right? Yeah.

229
00:15:35,032 --> 00:15:39,403
Hey, right. Somebody just took off in your
van.

230
00:15:41,805 --> 00:15:43,307
I guess you want one of my scarecrows?

231
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,879
No, don't tell. Just tell me when you need
the oil right, it's right behind you there.

232
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:57,721
Harold's Frisbee stuck up a tree, gave us the
subject for this week's Adventures with Bill.

233
00:16:00,657 --> 00:16:04,261
Harry is all set to help us get the frisbee
down first.

234
00:16:04,261 --> 00:16:12,869
First plan is not going to work Plan B
subsection four Climb a tree that has no

235
00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:14,871
branches on it. Let's think this through
once in a while.

236
00:16:14,905 --> 00:16:24,047
Can we bill? Now, when he when he made that
gesture, I thought he wanted me to do it and

237
00:16:24,047 --> 00:16:25,182
I thought, no, he wants my.

238
00:16:27,351 --> 00:16:29,553
Ok. All right. Yeah, that is what he meant.

239
00:16:29,586 --> 00:16:32,089
All right, and then this doesn't Bill's not
like.

240
00:16:34,591 --> 00:16:36,026
All right. He's going to just knock it down
with us.

241
00:16:36,126 --> 00:16:37,260
Why don't we start with this?

242
00:16:37,294 --> 00:16:41,932
Oh, wait, oh, it's he hit it and it went up
and actually went up and said it all now.

243
00:16:42,165 --> 00:16:47,871
Oh man, it's way they were up there, 50 60
foot tree and way way.

244
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:52,542
Now what do we do, bill? That Bill never
gives up, unfortunately.

245
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:57,781
So he tied his rope around himself, and he's
going to throw the end of the rope through

246
00:16:57,781 --> 00:17:01,284
the park and the tree, and then I'll pull, I
pull down on the rope.

247
00:17:01,752 --> 00:17:06,490
But what happened was it hit the van and
then it was at last to not cord around the

248
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,325
trailer hitch, which we didn't notice.

249
00:17:09,226 --> 00:17:13,396
So I started pulling down on the rope and
trying to pull Belle up the tree.

250
00:17:13,396 --> 00:17:18,902
And what neither one of us realized was that
Harold had decided to take the van into town

251
00:17:19,503 --> 00:17:20,804
by himself a new frisbee.

252
00:17:21,505 --> 00:17:22,772
What he was doing across was pulling their
own.

253
00:17:28,578 --> 00:17:29,880
Oh, oh, oh oh.

254
00:17:31,581 --> 00:17:34,150
No arbitrary and came back down and the van
still going.

255
00:17:35,418 --> 00:17:37,821
The news is we got the frisbee back.

256
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:50,166
Ok, with the plug, huh? Beautiful day.

257
00:17:58,241 --> 00:18:02,779
Well, the largest kind of divided into into
two camps on this thing with the canoe, on

258
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:06,182
the one hand, there's people who think that
helmets shouldn't have to replace the canoe

259
00:18:06,182 --> 00:18:10,053
or even repair it. They think that anybody
who can can turn on actually a metal boat

260
00:18:10,053 --> 00:18:13,657
inside out, you know, that's something to be
admired, even with a with a little tinge of

261
00:18:13,657 --> 00:18:18,094
fear. And then the other camp, you have the
pay as you play people, which is mainly

262
00:18:18,094 --> 00:18:18,762
Douglas,

263
00:18:18,928 --> 00:18:22,899
You know, actually, Uncle Fred Douglas is
convinced Moose Thompson to support him.

264
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,002
Wow. I wonder how he got moose on his side.

265
00:18:26,436 --> 00:18:31,007
Maybe he removed a thorn from his paw, and
moose can sway a few votes.

266
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,676
That guy's got fish like tractors.

267
00:18:32,776 --> 00:18:34,344
Oh, I changed my vote.

268
00:18:35,578 --> 00:18:36,846
You know if I had one.

269
00:18:38,148 --> 00:18:39,516
This is going to make the lads think twice.

270
00:18:39,516 --> 00:18:43,953
I'll tell you. It might even make you think
once, Harold, how did how do you mean when it

271
00:18:43,953 --> 00:18:50,527
happens? You'll know. Well, either either
Moose Thompson is just persuaded his first

272
00:18:50,527 --> 00:18:51,828
lodge member, or that's the call of a
meeting.

273
00:18:52,195 --> 00:18:53,430
No, that's the call of the meeting.

274
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:56,366
All right. Come on. Let's get down there and
see what's going on.

275
00:18:56,399 --> 00:18:58,001
I wonder if any of the lodge members are
intimidated?

276
00:18:59,068 --> 00:19:05,642
Oh, well, there's going to probably be some
nasty language and some violent threats and a

277
00:19:05,642 --> 00:19:09,879
lot of crisis and conflict and all kinds of
horrible things going on down there.

278
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:11,247
So I really don't want to miss this.

279
00:19:22,592 --> 00:19:30,700
All right. Guam.

280
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:34,137
No. Time now

281
00:19:38,141 --> 00:19:40,143
For recognizers. Douglas Henry Jack.

282
00:19:40,944 --> 00:19:47,350
Thank you, Ed. Well, everyone, I have some
excellent news I've discovered.

283
00:19:47,383 --> 00:19:55,191
Thank you, Harold. I've discovered why our
Treasury is empty, why I think this is a list

284
00:19:55,592 --> 00:20:00,763
of all the things that helmet has broken
over the years when I totaled what he

285
00:20:00,763 --> 00:20:05,134
totaled. It came to twenty thousand dollars.

286
00:20:05,134 --> 00:20:05,835
Are things

287
00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:10,340
A dollars? Ten thousand things?

288
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,911
Well, maybe if I made a list of all this
stuff I fixed over the years, that had come

289
00:20:14,911 --> 00:20:16,212
to twenty thousand two.

290
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,451
I think not helmet half the items on this
list you wrecked by fixing them.

291
00:20:21,584 --> 00:20:22,852
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.

292
00:20:22,852 --> 00:20:26,122
I mean, hell, it fixes a lot of things
around here like the pump.

293
00:20:26,155 --> 00:20:29,559
He fixes the pump and we all know how
expensive plumbers are, right?

294
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:38,000
Tell me you're a menace.

295
00:20:40,636 --> 00:20:43,473
Well, now I feel very strongly.

296
00:20:43,673 --> 00:20:47,310
And more importantly, so does Moose Thompson
over there.

297
00:20:47,677 --> 00:20:52,248
Thank you, Moose. But how much should
reimburse the lodge for damages?

298
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:55,418
I'm really surprised you're going along with
this moose.

299
00:20:55,618 --> 00:20:57,120
We apply this rule to you.

300
00:20:57,153 --> 00:21:00,123
You asked for seven beds, a hundred chairs
and a wall.

301
00:21:00,456 --> 00:21:01,891
Well, actually not.

302
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,760
Is he in order to get moose support?

303
00:21:05,061 --> 00:21:07,263
I made an immunity deal with him.

304
00:21:08,397 --> 00:21:09,532
Well, hold it. Hold it, hold it.

305
00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:11,634
Let's put some common sense into this.

306
00:21:11,634 --> 00:21:12,768
All right. This is stupid.

307
00:21:12,768 --> 00:21:14,303
I mean, this is this is a really stupid.

308
00:21:14,303 --> 00:21:18,474
This is dumb. Look, I make a living out of
fixing things that you guys broke.

309
00:21:18,474 --> 00:21:22,945
All right. So if you take that away, you
bankrupt the only marina on Possum Lake.

310
00:21:23,112 --> 00:21:24,714
I mean, that's dumb. That's just stupid.

311
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,782
No, no. Wait a minute. We'll still need
repairs.

312
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:31,153
It's just now the members will pay instead
of the lodge.

313
00:21:31,587 --> 00:21:33,756
Oh, so I might get paid.

314
00:21:35,258 --> 00:21:37,293
Oh, I'm for it.

315
00:21:37,493 --> 00:21:38,027
I'm for it.

316
00:21:38,361 --> 00:21:40,730
No, no, no. Wait, now Glenn has a very good
point here.

317
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:41,797
Oh, no. Read just forget it.

318
00:21:41,831 --> 00:21:42,832
What I said. Just move on, right?

319
00:21:42,832 --> 00:21:43,966
That's OK. That's OK.

320
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,069
And we're glad you see it. If people have to
pay for stuff that they break, they'll

321
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:50,640
they'll start being careful and they'll
they'll start not using stuff, right?

322
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,675
And then there won't be any damage for you
to repair.

323
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:55,811
Oh, well, that's actually what I meant.

324
00:21:56,379 --> 00:21:58,247
That sounds like what I meant. It was
stupid.

325
00:21:58,614 --> 00:22:00,650
Just dumb, just stupid.

326
00:22:00,683 --> 00:22:01,617
Now, wait a minute.

327
00:22:02,318 --> 00:22:03,786
You don't fix anything anyways.

328
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:08,824
We've got a 14 foot lab streak that's been
in for repairs since nineteen fifty two.

329
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:16,365
It'll be ready Tuesday night, Wednesday
morning, early, maybe tomorrow.

330
00:22:17,733 --> 00:22:19,268
Well, why don't we put this thing to a vote,
huh?

331
00:22:20,603 --> 00:22:24,540
All those in favor of the members like
helmet hair being charged for whatever they

332
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,109
brake, say I, I.

333
00:22:29,478 --> 00:22:30,780
All opposed, say nay.

334
00:22:33,082 --> 00:22:36,419
Sorry, Douglas. Well, it was close.

335
00:22:37,286 --> 00:22:41,757
Right? So if there's no other large
business, OK, Bill, I'm going to call on

336
00:22:41,757 --> 00:22:42,958
helmet here to give us the evening's
entertainment.

337
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,794
All right. Oh, great.

338
00:22:45,795 --> 00:22:47,029
Thank you, red. Thank you.

339
00:22:47,363 --> 00:22:49,465
So I was white water rafting I always got.

340
00:22:49,465 --> 00:22:51,867
I brought my mom there because we were going
over the falls that had come over to the

341
00:22:51,867 --> 00:22:52,868
canoe bent up.

342
00:22:55,371 --> 00:22:59,708
You know, listening to Douglas and Helmet
present their cases to forty six.

343
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:05,247
Normally slack-jawed, individuals who
listened in some cases comprehend them and

344
00:23:05,247 --> 00:23:08,884
then cast their votes as their hearts and
their conscience dictated.

345
00:23:09,285 --> 00:23:12,888
And I couldn't help but think that if we had
a TV and a good football game was on, none of

346
00:23:12,888 --> 00:23:14,590
this would have happened better.

347
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,625
Like gas, they fill the space available
anyway.

348
00:23:18,194 --> 00:23:19,228
Yeah, my wife is watching.

349
00:23:19,228 --> 00:23:22,531
I'll be coming straight home after the
meeting and I'm I'm feeling kind of wide

350
00:23:22,531 --> 00:23:24,133
awake. So why don't we hit the sack early?

351
00:23:25,067 --> 00:23:29,872
So I'm so next time on behalf of Harold and
myself and the whole gang up here at Possum

352
00:23:29,872 --> 00:23:31,674
Lodge? Keep your stick on the ice.

353
00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:41,750
You know, I was like going like this with my
hands, and I kept on scooping little kids out

354
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:45,421
of the water. It's difficult, you know, to
move the boat through the water with your

355
00:23:45,421 --> 00:23:50,259
hands open like that. We'll be tracking mud
on the carpet there anyway.
