1
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:04,437
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,373
HERE'S THE MAN WITH THE PLAN

3
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:08,108
HE THOUGHT OF IN THE CAN...

4
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,309
IF YOU'RE A FAN

5
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:10,977
OF THE MAN IN THE VAN...

6
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:12,879
PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER FOR

7
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,714
RED GREEN... EGGS AND HAM!

8
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,082
HOW YOU DOIN'?

9
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,584
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

10
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,085
ALL RIGHT.

11
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:20,587
(Applause and cheering)

12
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:22,756
HERE'S THE FREAK WITH THE BEAK

13
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:25,058
AND THE CHUBBY CHEEK -- HAROLD!

14
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:28,194
(Applause)

15
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:30,997
ALL RIGHT, COOL IT --
PUT A SOCK IN IT.

16
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,433
I DID, AND EVERYBODY LAUGHED.

17
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,767
(Laughing)

18
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,102
(Laughing)

19
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:37,770
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW, OK?

20
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:41,274
WE HAD A GOVERNMENT BUILDING
INSPECTOR COME INTO TOWN

21
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,676
AND PULL A SURPRISE
SAFETY INSPECTION

22
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:46,112
ON THE COMMUNITY CENTRE
THIS MORNING.

23
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:49,349
HE FILLED OUT A REPORT,
SAYS IF WE DON'T FIX IT,

24
00:00:49,415 --> 00:00:51,017
HE'S GONNA HAVE IT CONDEMNED.

25
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,752
HE CAN'T DO THAT!

26
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:55,154
WHERE WILL THEY HOLD
THE TEEN DANCES?

27
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,623
YOU DON'T GO
TO DANCES.

28
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,758
I WILL... WHEN
I'M BETTER-LOOKING

29
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:00,093
AND I LEARN KARATE.

30
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:02,495
SO WE GOTTA
SAVE

31
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,831
THE COMMUNITY CENTRE --
WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT?

32
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:08,067
JUST THREE THINGS --
THE ROOF, THE WALLS, THE FLOOR.

33
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:09,502
OH!

34
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:14,507
(Horns honking)

35
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,110
(Geese honking)

36
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:20,613
(Quacking)

37
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:26,085
(Red): YOU'RE LOOKIN'
AT SEGMENTS

38
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:27,854
FROM THIS PARTICULAR SHOW,

39
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,222
THE MAIN MESSAGE BEING,

40
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,858
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT CHANGING THE CHANNEL.

41
00:01:31,924 --> 00:01:35,528
TO MAKE SENSE
OUT OF THIS PROGRAMME,

42
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,164
YOU GOTTA GIVE IT
YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.

43
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:48,307
I GOT THE SCOOP -- THE BUILDING
INSPECTOR WAS CALLED IN

44
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:51,110
TO THE COMMUNITY CENTRE
BY A WEDDING PARTY.

45
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:53,379
THEY HAD A WEDDING THERE
LAST WEEK.

46
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:57,050
ONE OF THE STEEL "I" BEAMS
SWUNG LOOSE FROM THE CEILING,

47
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:59,452
DROPPED DOWN
ONTO THE WEDDING CAKE...

48
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,722
CRACKED THE ICING AND CRUSHED
THE BRIDE AND GROOM.

49
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,258
I'LL TELL YOU,
PEOPLE ARE SUCH WHINERS.

50
00:02:05,324 --> 00:02:06,793
IT'S THE BRIDE
AND GROOM

51
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:08,294
ON THE CAKE.

52
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,029
YOU'RE KIDDING.
YEAH.

53
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:11,531
MAN!

54
00:02:11,597 --> 00:02:14,767
OK, ANYWAY, IF THE COMMUNITY
CENTRE GETS CONDEMNED,

55
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:18,738
PEOPLE WILL HAVE QUILTING BEES
AND CRAFT SHOWS AT THE LODGE.

56
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,072
WE CAN'T HAVE THAT!

57
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:21,407
YOU KNOW WHAT I DID?

58
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,742
WHAT DID YOU DO?

59
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,244
I SUGGESTED WE HAVE
A FUND-RAISER,

60
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,681
TO RAISE FUNDS TO REPAIR
THE COMMUNITY CENTRE.

61
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:30,416
IT'S THE CENTRE
OF OUR COMMUNITY.

62
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,784
ABSOLUTELY,
YEAH.

63
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,953
THE HEART AND SOUL
OF POSSUM LAKE,

64
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,788
AND REFLECTS OUR COMMUNITY...

65
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:38,758
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT
IT'S OLD, CRACKED, AND SMELLY.

66
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,126
THAT'S IT, HAROLD.

67
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:43,229
UNFORTUNATELY, THE TOWNSPEOPLE
DIDN'T TAKE THAT WELL

68
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,697
TO HAROLD'S SUGGESTION.

69
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,533
I TOOK A REAL HAY-MAKER
RIGHT TO THE STOMACH.

70
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,403
MOOSE'S GRANDMOTHER
CAN BE MEAN!

71
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:52,205
SHE'S GOT THE...

72
00:02:52,271 --> 00:02:55,775
I GAVE AS GOOD AS I GOT...
IN TERMS OF SCREAMING.

73
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:59,378
DON'T WORRY -- THE MEN OF
POSSUM LODGE WILL TAKE OVER.

74
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:02,481
WE'RE GONNA RAISE MONEY
TO REBUILD THE CENTRE.

75
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:03,816
REMEMBER LAST YEAR

76
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,885
WHERE WE SOLD CHOCOLATE BARS?

77
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,253
CHOCOLATE BARS?
YEAH.

78
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,288
THOSE WERE BRICKS
OF OLD CHEESE.

79
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,157
CHOCOLATE BARS.
OLD CHEESE.

80
00:03:11,223 --> 00:03:12,758
WHAT WAS THE CRUNCHY MIDDLE?

81
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:15,227
VERY OLD CHEESE.

82
00:03:15,294 --> 00:03:17,330
(Audience laughing)

83
00:03:17,396 --> 00:03:19,131
(Red): SOMETHING SPECIAL

84
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,934
ON THE "ADVENTURES
WITH BILL" SEGMENT.

85
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,570
BILL AND I HAD
THE CANOES OUT AND...

86
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,072
HOW DOES HE DO THAT?

87
00:03:26,138 --> 00:03:27,673
HOW DOES HE MANAGE...

88
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,310
BILL HAD GONE TO THE
CHOCOLATE-BAR DRIVE-THROUGH.

89
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,645
OHHH!

90
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,413
YEAH, OH, THAT'S A SHAME.

91
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,748
OH, BY GOLLY, HUH?

92
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,350
YOU OK? ALL RIGHT.

93
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:40,986
IT'S THE KIND OF FUN
THAT YOU CAN HAVE OUTDOORS.

94
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:45,658
THE BEAUTY OF BEING OUTDOORS IS
THAT YOU'RE NOT INSIDE AS MUCH

95
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:49,128
AND YOU CAN BE OUT THERE,
AND THERE'S ROOM FOR YOU,

96
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:53,032
BECAUSE GUYS LIKE US ONLY NEED
THAT LITTLE EXTRA SPACE...

97
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,968
A PLACE TO DUMP
OUR CHOCOLATE BAR WRAPPERS...

98
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,470
AND THE MOTOR.

99
00:03:57,536 --> 00:03:59,605
IT WILL BE EASIER TO PORTAGE.

100
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:03,843
BILL AND I, EVERY YEAR, WE HAVE
OUR LITTLE PORTAGING RACE.

101
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:06,779
WE PUT THE CANOES ON
AND AWAY WE GO.

102
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:09,715
I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS FAIR... OHHH!

103
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,383
OHHHH! OHHHH! OHHHH!

104
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,887
BILL DROPPED THE CANOE
ON ME -- JUST A WAY

105
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,889
OF HANDICAPPING ME A LITTLE.

106
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,125
IT'S NOT FAIR,
JUST TO BEAT HIM,

107
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:20,726
SO LET'S HELP HIM OUT.

108
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:23,262
WE WANT A FAIR RACE,
RIGHT, BILL?

109
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,763
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

110
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,366
YOU CAN USUALLY
PICK UP THE CANOE.

111
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,868
WHAT'S THE TROUBLE?

112
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:31,337
OH, MY GOSH,
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT--

113
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:32,771
OH, ALL RIGHT, OK.

114
00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:35,774
THIS MAKES IT HARDER
TO BEND THE KNEES.

115
00:04:35,841 --> 00:04:38,244
WE'LL BE BACK LATER WITH OUR...

116
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,179
... BIG RACE,
SO HANG IN FOR THAT.

117
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:41,447
OHHHHH

118
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:45,184
YIPPEE-YO, YAAA,
YAHOOEY, YALADY

119
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:48,020
YIPPEE-YI-YI-YI-YI-YI-YI

120
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:51,690
YES, THIS IS THE SONG
OF THE LONESOME COWBOY

121
00:04:51,757 --> 00:04:54,860
WHEN HE LANDS THE WRONG WAY
ON HIS SADDLE

122
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,528
AIEE-AIEE-AIEE!

123
00:04:56,595 --> 00:04:58,030
YIIII!

124
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:59,765
THIS IS FOR THE BIG ONE!

125
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,701
FOR A GRAND PRIZE
OF NINE COILS OF KOLBASA

126
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:05,404
AND A 12-POUND BREATH MINT,
UNCLE RED,

127
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,374
YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO GET MR. DOUGIE FRANKLIN

128
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,708
TO SAY THIS WORD.

129
00:05:09,775 --> 00:05:11,043
"ROMANTIC."

130
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,444
WAHAHH!

131
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,614
AND GO!

132
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:16,949
ALL RIGHT,
DOUGIE.

133
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,852
SENSUAL, PASSIONATE, POETIC...

134
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,355
1963 CORVETTE STINGRAY.

135
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:27,526
NO, NO, WHEN A MAN BUYS A WOMAN
FLOWERS AND CANDY,

136
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,128
THAT'S VERY...

137
00:05:29,194 --> 00:05:30,629
... OBVIOUS.

138
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:34,299
NO, YOU BRING A WOMAN
BACK TO YOUR PLACE.

139
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:35,768
THAT'S...

140
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:37,202
... A MIRACLE.

141
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:39,438
(Audience laughing)

142
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,975
OK, YOU DIM
THE LIGHTS DOWN LOW

143
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,309
TO MAKE IT
MORE...

144
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:45,911
... DIFFICULT
FOR THE NEIGHBOURS

145
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,446
TO SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

146
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,649
I REALLY GOTTA GET ME
SOME DRAPES, RED.

147
00:05:50,716 --> 00:05:52,684
IT'S HIDEOUS BACK THERE.

148
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:54,019
UH, I KNOW.

149
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:56,855
A WOMAN FALLS FOR A MAN
WHO IS...

150
00:05:56,922 --> 00:06:00,125
... UH, ABLE TO DRIVE
A MONSTER TRUCK?

151
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:01,560
NO? THAT'S
NOT IT?

152
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:02,828
I KNOW, I KNOW.

153
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:06,598
WHEN A GUY IS VERY SENSITIVE,
LAVISHES GIFTS,

154
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:10,302
AND IS VERY CONSIDERATE AND
VERY FEELING, HE'S OBVIOUSLY...

155
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,637
... GAY.

156
00:06:11,703 --> 00:06:14,706
(Audience laughing)

157
00:06:14,773 --> 00:06:17,242
WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME.

158
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:20,012
A '63 STINGRAY.

159
00:06:20,078 --> 00:06:21,814
OH, ROMANTIC!

160
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,284
(Laughing and applause)

161
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,252
THIS WEEK ON "HANDYMAN CORNER",

162
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:30,189
WE'LL SOLVE A MEMORY PROBLEM
WE'VE ALL FACED...

163
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:33,358
IT'S SUNDAY AFTERNOON,
YOU'RE LYING THERE RELAXING.

164
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:35,527
RELATIVES PULL IN
TO YOUR DRIVEWAY.

165
00:06:35,594 --> 00:06:37,396
YOU REALIZE IT'S THANKSGIVING

166
00:06:37,462 --> 00:06:39,765
AND IT'S YOUR TURN
TO HOST THE DINNER,

167
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:41,233
AND YOU'RE NOT DRESSED.

168
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,902
SO TWO QUESTIONS
POP INTO YOUR MIND.

169
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:48,140
FIRST, HOW CAN YOU COOK A
25-POUND TURKEY IN 13 MINUTES?

170
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:50,909
AND, SECONDLY,
WHERE ARE YOUR PANTS?

171
00:06:50,976 --> 00:06:53,679
I'M GONNA ANSWER
THE FIRST QUESTION.

172
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:56,081
YOU MIGHT BE THINKING
MICROWAVE OVEN.

173
00:06:56,148 --> 00:06:59,184
THEY COOK FAST,
THEY DON'T HEAT UP THE KITCHEN,

174
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:01,286
AND THEY DING
WHEN THEY'RE DONE.

175
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:03,722
PROBLEM IS,
THEY'RE TOO DARNED SMALL.

176
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:05,724
CAN'T GET THE TURKEY IN THERE.

177
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,893
YOU COULD CUT THEM UP
INTO PIECES

178
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,361
AND JAM EVERYTHING IN.

179
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:12,130
YOU COULD PUT THE MICROWAVE UP
ON ITS BACK

180
00:07:12,197 --> 00:07:13,699
AND JUMP ON THE TURKEY.

181
00:07:13,765 --> 00:07:16,134
YOU COULD RIP THE DOOR OFF
AND COOK 'ER,

182
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:19,705
BUT THAT REDUCES THE QUALITY
OF YOUR DINNER CONVERSATIONS.

183
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:22,708
SO I SAY JUST FORGET
ABOUT THE MICROWAVE.

184
00:07:22,774 --> 00:07:24,042
(Crashing)

185
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:26,111
GO WITH A MACROWAVE OVEN.

186
00:07:26,178 --> 00:07:28,280
I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.

187
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:31,416
YOU WANT TO GET
A BUNCH OF THESE ANIMAL CAGES.

188
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:33,618
YOU'RE GONNA BE COOKING
IN THESE

189
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:35,654
SO MAKE SURE THEY'RE EMPTY...

190
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:38,123
UNLESS YOU GOT
A REALLY WEIRD UNCLE.

191
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,427
BUT THE MAIN INGREDIENT IS YOUR
ENERGY-GATHERING HEAT-A-TRON,

192
00:07:42,494 --> 00:07:44,596
ALSO KNOWN AS A SATELLITE DISH.

193
00:07:44,663 --> 00:07:46,832
YOU CAN PICK THESE UP ANYWHERE,

194
00:07:46,898 --> 00:07:50,001
ESPECIALLY IN OPEN FIELDS
ON MOONLESS NIGHTS.

195
00:07:50,068 --> 00:07:52,571
YOU WANT TO MOUNT
YOUR SATELLITE DISH

196
00:07:52,637 --> 00:07:55,874
ON SOMETHING SOLID AND LOW,
LIKE A WATER HEATER

197
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:58,276
OR MOOSE THOMPSON'S
BEAN-BAG CHAIR.

198
00:07:58,343 --> 00:08:00,212
I GOT 'ER ONTO AN OIL DRUM.

199
00:08:00,278 --> 00:08:04,683
NO MATTER WHAT TIME IT IS, PART
OF THIS IS ALWAYS FACING SOUTH.

200
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:06,318
LOOKS GOOD, LOOKS GOOD.

201
00:08:06,384 --> 00:08:08,553
ALL RIGHT, THE NEXT PROBLEM IS,

202
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,490
GOTTA FIND A WAY
TO RAISE MY OVEN CHAMBERS

203
00:08:11,556 --> 00:08:14,159
SO THEY'RE IN THE PRIMARY
COOKING ZONE

204
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:15,694
OF MY SATELLITE DISH.

205
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,762
OH! ALL RIGHT.

206
00:08:19,764 --> 00:08:22,300
THIS SWING SET SHOULD WORK
ABSOLUTELY GREAT.

207
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:25,303
NOT ONLY WILL THIS HOLD
THE TURKEY UP HIGH,

208
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,707
IT ALLOWS ME TO SWING IT OUT
OF THE HARMFUL RAYS

209
00:08:28,773 --> 00:08:31,877
SO I DON'T ADD MY OWN
RUMP ROAST TO THE MENU.

210
00:08:31,943 --> 00:08:34,412
ALL I GOTTA DO
IS REMOVE THE SEATS.

211
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,717
RUST IS A REAL TIME-SAVER.

212
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:41,486
NOW ALL WE GOTTA DO

213
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:46,224
IS STICK FOOD INTO THE CAGES
AND LET MR. SUN DO HIS THING.

214
00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:04,442
I THINK WHAT I'VE FORGOTTEN
IS THAT, AROUND THANKSGIVING,

215
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:07,679
THE SUN IS NOT AS HOT
AS IT NEEDS TO BE FOR THIS.

216
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:11,249
MAYBE WE NEED TO SWITCH TO
A DIFFERENT SOURCE OF ENERGY.

217
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:13,551
MAYBE TAKE APART
THIS MICROWAVE OVEN

218
00:09:13,618 --> 00:09:16,021
AND GET THE MICROWAVE TUBE
OR GENERATOR

219
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:18,590
OR WHATEVER IT IS
THAT MAKES MICROWAVES.

220
00:09:18,656 --> 00:09:21,259
MIGHT EVEN BE A LITTLE
WAVE-POOL IN THERE.

221
00:09:21,326 --> 00:09:23,695
WE'LL FIND OUT
WHEN WE TAKE 'ER APART.

222
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:26,931
ALL RIGHT, WE GOT
SQUARE-HEAD BOLTS.

223
00:09:26,998 --> 00:09:29,200
LOOKS LIKE THE RED SIZE.

224
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:31,703
I GOT THE GREEN...

225
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,139
I GOT THE BLACK -- NO RED.

226
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:35,774
OH, WELL.

227
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:42,046
WE GOT OUR MICROWAVE GENERATOR
WIRED TO THE SATELLITE DISH,

228
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:44,015
WHICH BECOMES AN AMPLIFIER --

229
00:09:44,082 --> 00:09:47,118
GONNA BOOST THE MICROWAVE
OUTPUT OF 1,500 WATTS

230
00:09:47,185 --> 00:09:49,754
UP INTO THE AREA OF
5 TRILLION MEGAHERTZ

231
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:51,422
OF NEUTRON FUSION ENERGY.

232
00:09:51,489 --> 00:09:55,293
THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO COOK
THOSE HARD-TO-GET-AT PLACES.

233
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,529
IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

234
00:09:57,595 --> 00:09:59,731
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

235
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:01,633
LET'S GET COOKIN'.

236
00:10:10,341 --> 00:10:11,776
(Coughing)

237
00:10:11,843 --> 00:10:13,678
AHHH...

238
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:15,180
HOLY MACKEREL.

239
00:10:15,246 --> 00:10:18,750
THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT
OF SHRINKAGE WITH THESE.

240
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:22,754
I THINK I SHOULD HAVE STARTED
WITH A LARGER TURKEY.

241
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,255
HAROLD!

242
00:10:24,322 --> 00:10:25,757
JUST KIDDING...

243
00:10:25,823 --> 00:10:27,592
... UNLESS YOU WANT TO.

244
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:31,829
STAY TUNED -- WHATEVER THIS IS,
WE GOT LOTS MORE OF IT.

245
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:39,671
WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
SOMETHING I HEARD IN TOWN.

246
00:10:39,737 --> 00:10:41,005
OLD LADY BENKMAN SAID

247
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:43,041
YOU CAN'T CONTROL
THE UGLY THINGS

248
00:10:43,107 --> 00:10:45,510
PEOPLE SAY ABOUT YOU
AFTER YOU'RE DEAD.

249
00:10:45,576 --> 00:10:47,412
I THINK THAT'S TRUE.

250
00:10:47,478 --> 00:10:51,015
I CAN'T CONTROL THE THINGS
PEOPLE SAY ABOUT ME

251
00:10:51,082 --> 00:10:52,417
WHILE I'M LIVING.

252
00:10:52,483 --> 00:10:55,420
I DON'T ANTICIPATE
GETTING BETTER AT IT

253
00:10:55,486 --> 00:10:57,422
AFTER I'M SIX FEET UNDER.

254
00:10:57,488 --> 00:11:01,259
SO YOU CAN'T STOP PEOPLE
FROM SAYING BAD STUFF ABOUT YOU

255
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:02,527
AFTER YOU'RE DEAD.

256
00:11:02,593 --> 00:11:04,128
IS THAT REAL IMPORTANT?

257
00:11:04,195 --> 00:11:06,597
UNLESS YOU HAVE
EXCEPTIONAL HEARING,

258
00:11:06,664 --> 00:11:07,999
YOU MAY NOT NOTICE.

259
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:11,602
TO PLAY IT SAFE, YOU COULD GET
BURIED WITH EARPLUGS IN.

260
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:13,805
YOU CAN'T CONTROL WHAT THEY SAY

261
00:11:13,871 --> 00:11:16,941
BUT YOU CAN CONTROL
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S TRUE.

262
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:18,910
ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS

263
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:22,280
SO MAKE SURE YOUR ACTIONS
ARE LOUDER THAN THEIR WORDS.

264
00:11:22,346 --> 00:11:25,049
IF THEY SAY THAT
YOU WERE A DRUNKEN WOMANIZER,

265
00:11:25,116 --> 00:11:28,686
WHEREAS YOU LED A SOBER LIFE
AND WERE A DECENT FAMILY MAN,

266
00:11:28,753 --> 00:11:32,390
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE A HARD TIME
GETTING ANYBODY TO LISTEN...

267
00:11:32,457 --> 00:11:36,494
WHEREAS IF IT WAS THE BOOZE
AND BABES THAT KILLED YOU,

268
00:11:36,561 --> 00:11:38,396
WELL, YOU GOT A PROBLEM.

269
00:11:38,463 --> 00:11:41,132
BUT BY THEN, YOU'LL PROBABLY BE
IN A HOT SPOT

270
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:43,901
AND NOT THAT CONCERNED
WITH PUBLIC RELATIONS.

271
00:11:43,968 --> 00:11:45,670
SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

272
00:11:45,736 --> 00:11:47,905
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

273
00:11:47,972 --> 00:11:49,907
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

274
00:11:49,974 --> 00:11:53,110
(Applause)

275
00:11:53,177 --> 00:11:55,813
THE COMMUNITY CENTRE
FUND-RAISING COMMITTEE

276
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,616
HAD ITS FIRST MEETING --
DIDN'T GO REAL WELL.

277
00:11:58,683 --> 00:12:01,219
IN HINDSIGHT, THE OPEN BAR
WAS A MISTAKE.

278
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:06,157
DID YOU EVER MAKE ANY MOTIONS
FOR FUND-RAISING?

279
00:12:06,224 --> 00:12:08,860
BUSTER HADFIELD SUGGESTED
WE HAVE A WALK-A-THON.

280
00:12:08,926 --> 00:12:10,528
THAT'S EXCELLENT! THAT'S GREAT!

281
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:13,431
A WALK-A-THON'S
A GREAT WAY TO MAKE MONEY!

282
00:12:13,497 --> 00:12:16,000
WE FOUND OUT
THERE'S WALKING INVOLVED

283
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:17,468
SO WE PUT THAT ASIDE.

284
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,704
MOOSE THOMPSON
HAD A GREAT IDEA.

285
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,706
BELCH-A-THON?

286
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:26,310
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHEN I SAY
"THRILLS, CHILLS, AND SPILLS"?

287
00:12:26,377 --> 00:12:29,447
ANDREA THOMPSON POURING
A CHERRY SLURPEE DOWN MY PANTS

288
00:12:29,513 --> 00:12:31,082
AT THE SADIE HAWKINS DANCE.

289
00:12:31,148 --> 00:12:33,551
(Audience laughing)

290
00:12:33,618 --> 00:12:37,088
PEOPLE MIGHT PAY MONEY
TO SEE THAT, BUT...

291
00:12:37,154 --> 00:12:39,790
I'M TALKING ABOUT A FUN FAIR...

292
00:12:39,857 --> 00:12:43,527
THE POSSUM LODGE FUN FAIR --
NOT LIKE ANY OTHER FUN FAIR.

293
00:12:43,594 --> 00:12:46,897
THERE WILL BE NO FUN
AND NO FAIR.

294
00:12:46,964 --> 00:12:48,299
(Laughing)

295
00:12:55,473 --> 00:12:58,142
ALL RIGHT, WELCOME TO
"AUTO BIOGRAPHY",

296
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:00,211
WHERE MEMBERS OF POSSUM LODGE

297
00:13:00,277 --> 00:13:03,414
TALK ABOUT CARS
THAT MEANT SOMETHING TO THEM.

298
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:06,784
HAP, WHAT WAS
YOUR FAVOURITE CAR?

299
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:08,119
OH, MY...

300
00:13:08,185 --> 00:13:12,423
I'D HAVE TO SAY
MY '62 ASTON-MARTIN D.B.S.

301
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,925
GOLD FINISH...
BEAUTIFUL MACHINE.

302
00:13:14,992 --> 00:13:17,895
THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE CAR
JAMES BOND DROVE

303
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:21,031
BEFORE HE WAS ROGER MOORE
OR TIMOTHY DALTON

304
00:13:21,098 --> 00:13:23,467
OR PIERCE BROSNAN
OR THAT OLD GUY.

305
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:24,935
IT WAS THE CAR, HAROLD.

306
00:13:25,002 --> 00:13:27,505
I OWNED THE CAR
THAT WAS IN THOSE MOVIES.

307
00:13:27,571 --> 00:13:30,975
YOU BOUGHT THAT
FROM THE PRODUCERS?

308
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,744
NO, THEY BOUGHT IT FROM ME.

309
00:13:33,811 --> 00:13:35,379
THEY NEEDED AN ASTON-MARTIN

310
00:13:35,446 --> 00:13:37,448
AND THEY KNEW
MINE HAD MACHINE-GUNS

311
00:13:37,515 --> 00:13:39,717
AND BULLET-PROOF SHIELDS...

312
00:13:39,783 --> 00:13:41,385
(Audience laughing)

313
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:44,889
... AND REVOLVING LICENCE
PLATES, AN EJECTION SEAT,

314
00:13:44,955 --> 00:13:48,893
AND THAT THING THAT CAME OUT
OF THE WHEEL -- WAH-WAH-WAH!

315
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,095
AND THAT WAS IT --
END OF STORY.

316
00:13:51,162 --> 00:13:53,831
THIS WHOLE STORY'S
KIND OF WAH-WAH-WAH.

317
00:13:53,898 --> 00:13:55,165
(Laughing)

318
00:13:55,232 --> 00:13:58,402
YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOU USED ALL THOSE GADGETS?

319
00:13:58,469 --> 00:13:59,737
NO!

320
00:13:59,803 --> 00:14:01,138
GOD! YOU KIDDING?

321
00:14:01,205 --> 00:14:04,875
NO, I NEVER USED
THE REVOLVING LICENCE PLATES,

322
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:09,113
BUT THOSE MACHINE-GUNS
CAME IN HANDY MORE THAN ONCE.

323
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:13,384
WITHOUT THE BULLET-PROOF
SHIELD, I WOULDN'T BE HERE NOW.

324
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,754
NO, WHEN YOU HAVE THOSE THINGS,
YOU USE 'EM.

325
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,424
I COULD GO FOR AN EJECTION SEAT
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

326
00:14:20,491 --> 00:14:22,726
OR A CYANIDE CAPSULE.

327
00:14:22,793 --> 00:14:25,863
THIS WAS A BUSINESS CAR, HAP?

328
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,464
OH, YEAH! YEAH, KIND OF.

329
00:14:27,531 --> 00:14:31,201
COME ON, YOU KNEW I WAS IN
HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE.

330
00:14:31,268 --> 00:14:32,536
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

331
00:14:32,603 --> 00:14:35,372
DOUBLE-OH-NOTHING,
LICENCE TO BULL.

332
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:38,375
OHHHH... OH, BEAUTIFUL CAR,
THOUGH, RED.

333
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:39,710
YEAH.

334
00:14:39,777 --> 00:14:42,379
HAD A BUILT-IN BAR
AND A SPY CAMERA...

335
00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:44,381
SATELLITE LOCATOR...

336
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:46,383
EVEN A LIE-DETECTOR.

337
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,619
MUST HAVE DRAINED THE BATTERY

338
00:14:48,686 --> 00:14:51,155
EVERY TIME
YOU OPENED YOUR MOUTH!

339
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:56,293
HERE WE ARE, ALL SET
FOR OUR BIG PORTAGE RACE.

340
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,395
OK, GENTLEMEN...

341
00:14:58,462 --> 00:15:00,397
START YOUR ANGINA.

342
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:03,500
OK, WE'RE OFF AND
I GOT A BIT OF A LEAD.

343
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:05,369
ONE THING SURPRISES ME.

344
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:08,405
WE NEVER GET A TURN-OUT,
SPECTATOR-WISE, FOR THIS,

345
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:09,907
FOR SOME REASON.

346
00:15:09,973 --> 00:15:12,176
I THINK THERE'S A LOT TO WATCH.

347
00:15:12,242 --> 00:15:14,478
I'M NOT SURE HOW SAFE YOU'D BE,

348
00:15:14,545 --> 00:15:18,415
WITHIN, SAY, A CANOE'S-LENGTH
OF THE ACTUAL RACE ITSELF.

349
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:19,883
IF YOU HUNG BACK

350
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,419
WITH A TELEPHOTO, YOU COULD GET
INTERESTING SHOTS.

351
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:23,887
I'M WELL OUT AHEAD.

352
00:15:23,954 --> 00:15:25,756
BILL HAS A DIFFERENT APPROACH.

353
00:15:25,823 --> 00:15:27,057
HE REALLY BENDS OVER.

354
00:15:27,124 --> 00:15:28,992
HE'S GOT
THE LOWER-BACK PROBLEM.

355
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:30,627
THAT SHOULD HELP THAT.

356
00:15:30,694 --> 00:15:33,430
HANG ON, HANG ON,
BUT HE'S GOT THE RIGHT IDEA.

357
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:36,366
LOOK OUT, BILL --
TREE, BILL! TREE, BILL!

358
00:15:36,433 --> 00:15:38,435
OHHHHH! DON'T BE HAMMERING

359
00:15:38,502 --> 00:15:40,904
ON THAT TREE -- LOOK OUT!

360
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:44,007
LOOK OUT, HERE COMES THE CANOE!

361
00:15:44,074 --> 00:15:45,676
THAT HAS GOTTA HURT.

362
00:15:45,742 --> 00:15:49,479
I'M JUST MAKING MY WAY ALONG,
DOING JUST FINE.

363
00:15:49,546 --> 00:15:52,182
BILL, YOU'RE GOING
THE WRONG WAY.

364
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:54,051
NO, YOU SHOULD BE--
WHERE IS HE?

365
00:15:54,117 --> 00:15:55,385
OH, THERE HE IS.

366
00:15:55,452 --> 00:15:56,720
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

367
00:15:56,787 --> 00:15:58,121
YEAH, SEEMS FINE.

368
00:15:58,188 --> 00:16:00,224
AND... LOOKS LIKE I WON.

369
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,894
ALL I GOTTA DO
IS GET THE WHOLE THING IN--

370
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:05,495
BUT I LOOKED BACK.

371
00:16:05,562 --> 00:16:07,598
HERE HE COMES.

372
00:16:07,664 --> 00:16:09,166
GONNA BE A CLOSE RACE.

373
00:16:09,232 --> 00:16:10,867
HANG ON, BILL, HANG ON!

374
00:16:10,934 --> 00:16:12,569
BETTER GET MY CANOE--

375
00:16:12,636 --> 00:16:14,938
WHAT'S GOING ON? BILL!

376
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:17,140
LOOK OUT, LOOK OUT!

377
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:18,909
UH-OH! UH-OH!

378
00:16:18,976 --> 00:16:21,411
OHHH... AHHHH!

379
00:16:21,478 --> 00:16:23,347
HOLY MACKEREL.

380
00:16:23,413 --> 00:16:25,349
HE WON!

381
00:16:25,415 --> 00:16:27,818
I'D RATHER LOSE.

382
00:16:27,884 --> 00:16:29,453
HERE'S A WALKING STICK

383
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,422
MADE BY OUR PAL MICHAEL --
THANKS, MIKE.

384
00:16:37,361 --> 00:16:40,063
THE FUN FAIR'S GONNA RAISE
SO MUCH CASH,

385
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,532
WE CAN BUILD
A NEW COMMUNITY CENTRE.

386
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:44,735
I'M LOOKING AFTER
THE FIREWORKS.

387
00:16:44,801 --> 00:16:47,671
MOOSE THOMPSON'S GOT
THE DART-THROW GOING.

388
00:16:47,738 --> 00:16:49,306
GOT HIMSELF A '64 DART.

389
00:16:49,373 --> 00:16:50,974
(Audience laughing)

390
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:54,611
STRAPS PEOPLE INTO IT
AND JUST CHUCKS 'ER.

391
00:16:54,678 --> 00:16:57,047
HOW'S THE RING-TOSS COMIN'?

392
00:16:57,114 --> 00:16:59,049
EXCELLENT -- WATCH THIS,
WATCH THIS.

393
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:02,819
OH, BOY.

394
00:17:02,886 --> 00:17:04,821
NO PROBLEM --
JUST WATCH.

395
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:14,498
THAT'S HARD! WE'LL MAKE
A TON OF MONEY!

396
00:17:14,564 --> 00:17:15,932
OH, RIGHT, HAROLD.

397
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:19,870
THE BIG MONEY-MAKER'S GONNA BE
BUSTER'S FLIGHT SIMULATOR.

398
00:17:19,936 --> 00:17:22,172
A FLIGHT SIMULATOR?! AWWWWWW!

399
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:23,540
THEY'RE EXCELLENT!

400
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:25,041
THEY'RE SO WAY COOL!

401
00:17:25,108 --> 00:17:29,579
THEY'RE LIKE VIRTUAL REALITY,
3-D TO THE MAX, THEN YOU BARF.

402
00:17:29,646 --> 00:17:31,414
(Laughing)

403
00:17:31,481 --> 00:17:34,084
IS IT STATE-OF-THE-ART?

404
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,319
IS IT CUTTING-EDGE?

405
00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:39,990
YOU COULD CUT YOURSELF REAL BAD
ON ONE EDGE.

406
00:17:40,056 --> 00:17:41,391
IT'S A CHERRY-PICKER.

407
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,961
HE FOUND IT JUST SITTING
IN THE TELEPHONE PARKING LOT,

408
00:17:45,028 --> 00:17:48,131
AND HE JUST BLINDFOLDS PEOPLE,
WHIPS 'EM AROUND.

409
00:17:48,198 --> 00:17:50,100
HAROLD, WE GOT THE DUNK-TANK,

410
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:53,970
WHERE YOU THROW BASEBLLS AND
THE GUY DROPS INTO THE TANK.

411
00:17:54,037 --> 00:17:55,839
I LOVE THOSE! I LOVE THOSE!

412
00:17:55,906 --> 00:17:57,340
WHO'S SUPPLYING THAT?

413
00:17:57,407 --> 00:17:59,109
UH, ROTHSCHILD'S SEWAGE.

414
00:17:59,175 --> 00:18:00,977
OH, EXCELLENT,
EXCELLENT.

415
00:18:01,044 --> 00:18:03,179
WHOOOOO!

416
00:18:03,246 --> 00:18:06,149
WHO'S THE SUCKER
WHO'S GONNA FALL

417
00:18:06,216 --> 00:18:08,752
IN THAT TANK ALL DAY LONG?

418
00:18:08,818 --> 00:18:10,253
(Audience laughing)

419
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,755
WHO? TELL ME!

420
00:18:11,821 --> 00:18:13,223
I'M GONNA FIND OUT!

421
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,759
I KNOW THE PERSON, DON'T I?

422
00:18:15,825 --> 00:18:17,260
I DO.

423
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:19,663
HAWWW....

424
00:18:19,729 --> 00:18:21,965
IT'S THE EXPERT PORTION
OF THE SHOW

425
00:18:22,032 --> 00:18:24,200
WHERE WE EXAMINE
THOSE THREE WORDS

426
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:26,269
THAT MEN FIND
SO HARD TO SAY...

427
00:18:26,336 --> 00:18:28,538
(Audience):
"I DON'T KNOW!"

428
00:18:28,605 --> 00:18:30,774
EITHER DO THEY.

429
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,877
JOINING MY UNCLE RED
IS HIS BEST FRIEND--

430
00:18:33,943 --> 00:18:35,211
OH, INSTEAD,

431
00:18:35,278 --> 00:18:38,281
IT'S MR. DALTON HUMPHREY!

432
00:18:38,348 --> 00:18:41,151
(Applause and cheering)

433
00:18:41,217 --> 00:18:44,854
THE VIEWER ASKS, "DEAR EXPERTS,
WHENEVER WE HAVE FRIENDS OVER

434
00:18:44,921 --> 00:18:47,924
"AND PLAY WORD GAMES,
LIKE SCRABBLE, THE MEN LOSE.

435
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:50,226
"THEN WE GET TO HEAR
HOW GOOD THEY ARE

436
00:18:50,293 --> 00:18:52,529
"AT THE GAME
'BUT I'VE GOT AN EXCUSE'.

437
00:18:52,595 --> 00:18:54,464
"WHY ARE MEN BAD
AT WORD GAMES?"

438
00:18:54,531 --> 00:18:57,300
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET THIS
CLEARED UP.

439
00:18:57,367 --> 00:18:58,668
THIS IS A MYTH.

440
00:18:58,735 --> 00:19:00,470
IT'S COMPLETELY FALSE.

441
00:19:00,537 --> 00:19:02,038
MEN ARE NOT, UH...

442
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:05,708
OK, BAD... AT WORD GAMES.

443
00:19:05,775 --> 00:19:08,578
"BAD", AS IN LIMITED,
DEFICIENT, INADEQUATE, INEPT?

444
00:19:08,645 --> 00:19:11,681
NO, I MEAN "OBNOXIOUS"
AS IN "HAROLD".

445
00:19:11,748 --> 00:19:13,016
(Laughing)

446
00:19:13,082 --> 00:19:14,517
YOU KNOW,

447
00:19:14,584 --> 00:19:17,153
MY WIFE, ANNE-MARIE,
AND I PLAY WORD GAMES

448
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,355
AS PART OF
OUR NORMAL CONVERSATION.

449
00:19:19,422 --> 00:19:21,324
SHE'LL STRING WORDS TOGETHER

450
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:24,694
AND I'LL TRY AND GUESS
WHAT SHE'S TALKIN' ABOUT.

451
00:19:24,761 --> 00:19:26,196
NOW, OK,

452
00:19:26,262 --> 00:19:27,664
I USUALLY GUESS WRONG,

453
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:31,467
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE I LOST
INTEREST AND STOPPED LISTENING.

454
00:19:31,534 --> 00:19:34,137
IT IS NOT BECAUSE
I'M NOT GOOD AT IT.

455
00:19:34,204 --> 00:19:37,140
SEE, THERE'S NO INCENTIVE
TO WIN ON THAT.

456
00:19:37,207 --> 00:19:38,474
IF YOU DO UNDERSTAND,

457
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,710
YOU HAVE TO GET UP
AND DO SOMETHING.

458
00:19:40,777 --> 00:19:44,047
SEE, DALTON AND I,
WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER.

459
00:19:44,113 --> 00:19:45,782
WELL, MEN UNDERSTAND MEN.

460
00:19:45,848 --> 00:19:47,650
WHEN MEN AND WOMEN HAVE WORDS,

461
00:19:47,717 --> 00:19:49,619
THAT'S WHERE
THE TROUBLE STARTS.

462
00:19:49,686 --> 00:19:52,922
SEE, WOMEN USE WORDS... UM...

463
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:55,024
THEY, UH...
WOMEN...

464
00:19:55,091 --> 00:19:56,859
TO, UH...

465
00:19:56,926 --> 00:20:00,430
COMMUNICATE, INFORM, DISCLOSE?

466
00:20:00,496 --> 00:20:02,765
WELL... CLOSE.
YEAH, OK.

467
00:20:02,832 --> 00:20:05,268
BUT... BUT...
BUT NOW, WITH MEN,

468
00:20:05,335 --> 00:20:06,736
WHAT THEY, UH... THEY, UH...

469
00:20:06,803 --> 00:20:08,071
UH...

470
00:20:08,137 --> 00:20:10,606
MEN... USE WORDS

471
00:20:10,673 --> 00:20:12,342
TO AVOID SAYING
SOMETHING.

472
00:20:12,408 --> 00:20:13,977
HERE WE GO -- THAT'S IT.

473
00:20:14,043 --> 00:20:15,311
THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT.

474
00:20:15,378 --> 00:20:16,779
THERE WE GO -- YEAH.

475
00:20:16,846 --> 00:20:18,114
(Laughing and applause)

476
00:20:18,181 --> 00:20:19,449
AND, YOU SEE,

477
00:20:19,515 --> 00:20:22,819
IF MEN HAVE SOMETHING
REAL IMPORTANT TO SAY,

478
00:20:22,885 --> 00:20:24,554
THEY'LL SHAKE HANDS...

479
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,824
OR HITCH UP THEIR PANTS
OR POINT AT SOMETHING.

480
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,192
YEAH, SURE, THAT'S IT.

481
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:31,327
THAT'S ALMOST ELOQUENT
IN ITS SIMPLICITY.

482
00:20:31,394 --> 00:20:33,663
(Audience laughing)

483
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,932
SORRY, HAROLD, YOU LOST ME.

484
00:20:35,998 --> 00:20:37,433
NEVER MIND,
IT'S OK.

485
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,869
MEN ARE NOT BAD AT WORD GAMES.

486
00:20:39,936 --> 00:20:41,971
IT'S JUST THAT WE... WE...

487
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:44,107
WHAT WE... WE, UH...

488
00:20:44,173 --> 00:20:46,342
WE USE THE BODY LANGUAGE.

489
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:48,845
WELL!

490
00:20:48,911 --> 00:20:50,179
YOU CERTAINLY HAVE

491
00:20:50,246 --> 00:20:52,849
A WELL-ROUNDED VOCABULARY
TO WORK WITH.

492
00:20:52,915 --> 00:20:56,853
(Laughing and applause)

493
00:20:59,422 --> 00:21:02,358
(Audience laughing)

494
00:21:02,425 --> 00:21:04,360
(Coughing)

495
00:21:06,362 --> 00:21:08,798
(Clearing throat)

496
00:21:08,865 --> 00:21:11,667
WELL, UH...

497
00:21:11,734 --> 00:21:13,169
THAT WAS, UH...

498
00:21:13,236 --> 00:21:14,670
THAT WAS, UH...

499
00:21:14,737 --> 00:21:17,173
THAT WAS QUITE A FUN FAIR.

500
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,309
FLIGHT SIMULATOR WAS GOOD,
RING-TOSS WAS GOOD.

501
00:21:20,376 --> 00:21:24,113
WHAT IDIOT WAS IN CHARGE
OF THE FIREWORKS?

502
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,549
YOU SHOULDN'T GO AROUND
CALLING PEOPLE IDIOTS.

503
00:21:26,616 --> 00:21:29,018
I KNEW IT WAS YOU! I KNEW!

504
00:21:29,085 --> 00:21:31,454
FUN FAIRS ALWAYS END
WITH FIREWORKS.

505
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,222
EVERYBODY AGREED TO THAT.

506
00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:35,124
BUT IT WASN'T RAINING THEN.

507
00:21:35,191 --> 00:21:38,828
WE DIDN'T KNOW
WE'D MOVE THE FUN FAIR INDOORS.

508
00:21:38,895 --> 00:21:40,463
(Laughing)

509
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:43,432
OTHER THAN THE FIRE,
I THINK IT WENT PRETTY WELL.

510
00:21:43,499 --> 00:21:47,703
HE BURNED THE COMMUNITY CENTRE
DOWN -- IT'S GONE!

511
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,038
(Laughing)

512
00:21:49,105 --> 00:21:51,173
THE FUN FAIR RAISED
ENOUGH MONEY

513
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,943
TO COVER THE DEDUCTIBLE
ON THE INSURANCE.

514
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,513
NOW WE GET A BRAND-NEW
COMMUNITY CENTRE.

515
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,749
I DON'T SEE A DOWN-SIDE.

516
00:21:59,815 --> 00:22:02,284
OK, HOW ABOUT
THE INSURANCE COMPANY

517
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:03,886
CANCELLING
YOUR POLICY?

518
00:22:03,953 --> 00:22:06,222
NOW WE DON'T HAVE TO
PAY PREMIUMS.

519
00:22:06,288 --> 00:22:07,556
OK, HOW
ABOUT THIS?

520
00:22:07,623 --> 00:22:09,825
I REFUSE TO HELP
WITH YOUR PROJECTS.

521
00:22:09,892 --> 00:22:12,294
MAN, I'M ON A ROLL!

522
00:22:12,361 --> 00:22:14,296
(Possum squeal)

523
00:22:14,363 --> 00:22:15,631
OH, MEETING TIME.

524
00:22:15,698 --> 00:22:17,933
YOU GO AHEAD --
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

525
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,770
I'M GONNA GET THE ASHES
OUT OF MY NOSTRILS.

526
00:22:20,836 --> 00:22:23,639
I THOUGHT THAT SPARKLER
WOULD NEVER GO OUT.

527
00:22:23,706 --> 00:22:25,074
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

528
00:22:25,141 --> 00:22:27,676
I'M COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

529
00:22:27,743 --> 00:22:30,012
IF YOU SEE SMOKE
COMING FROM MY PANTS,

530
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:32,715
REMEMBER, WHERE THERE'S SMOKE,
THERE'S FIRE.

531
00:22:32,782 --> 00:22:35,117
THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

532
00:22:35,184 --> 00:22:37,987
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND HAROLD AND THE GANG,

533
00:22:38,053 --> 00:22:39,822
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

534
00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:44,827
(Applause)

535
00:22:44,894 --> 00:22:49,832
(Possum squeal)

536
00:22:49,899 --> 00:22:51,333
(Harold): ALL RISE FOR

537
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,402
THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETING!

538
00:22:56,906 --> 00:23:00,342
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

539
00:23:00,409 --> 00:23:02,011
(Red): SIT DOWN.

540
00:23:02,077 --> 00:23:04,480
STINKY PETERSON ASKED ME

541
00:23:04,547 --> 00:23:06,182
TO ANNOUNCE THAT

542
00:23:06,248 --> 00:23:08,417
YOU CANNOT JUMP-START

543
00:23:08,484 --> 00:23:11,287
A '78 GREMLIN FROM A STOVE.

544
00:23:11,353 --> 00:23:13,255
ANYBODY WHO THINKS YOU CAN

545
00:23:13,322 --> 00:23:15,591
IS WELCOME TO DROP BY HIS PLACE

546
00:23:15,658 --> 00:23:17,593
AND PUT OUT A KITCHEN FIRE.
