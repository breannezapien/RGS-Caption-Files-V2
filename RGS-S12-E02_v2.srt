ALOT OF GUYS MY AGE DRINK
WAY TOO MUCH COFFEE.

00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:07,374
IT'S NOT HARD
TO FIGURE OUT.

3
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:10,343
IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD A GOOD
NIGHT'S SLEEP SINCE 1991,

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,614
OR IF YOU HEAR SOMETHING
HUMMING AND THEN YOU
REALIZE IT'S YOU,

5
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:18,351
OR IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD
TO BE ANYWHERE WHERE THEY
DON'T HAVE BATHROOMS OR TREES,

6
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:23,289
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO CUT DOWN
ON YOUR COFFEE INTAKE.

7
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:26,059
NOW, MY WIFE SUGGESTS THAT
I SHOULD DRINK TEA INSTEAD.

8
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:28,261
YEAH, RIGHT.

9
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:31,931
MAYBE I SHOULD TAKE UP DANCING
LESSONS AND LEARN HOW TO KNIT.

10
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:34,767
NO, NO, THE ANSWER IS
JUST TO GIVE UP COFFEE,

11
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,436
BUT THAT COULD
BE TOUGH TO DO.

12
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,438
ANYBODY WHO'S
TRIED TO CUT DOWN

13
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,373
OR LIVES WITH
SOMEONE WHO'S TRIED,

14
00:00:40,406 --> 00:00:42,709
KNOWS THAT
A MORNING WITHOUT COFFEE

15
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:45,378
IS KIND OF LIKE
A HOCKEY GAME WITHOUT A FIGHT.

16
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,147
WHAT YOU NEED IS
SOME INTERMEDIATE STEP

17
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,082
TO TAKE YOU FROM
TOO MUCH COFFEE

18
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:51,150
OVER TO NO COFFEE AT ALL.

19
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:56,089
SO GRAB A STRIP OFF THE OLD
HANDYMAN'S SECRET REHAB.

DOWN ON YOUR WORKBENCH,

YOU'VE MADE A

BE RELEASED FROM THE

THAT BY THIS POINT,

WE'D HAVE BUILT UP A CLIENTELE
OF REGULAR CUSTOMERS,

AND WE HAD SIX FOOTBALLS,

308
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,605
AND I PUT A COUPLE OF
INITIALS ON EACH ONE

309
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:03,307
SO THERE WAS
TWO WITH A "D",

310
00:14:03,374 --> 00:14:05,075
TWO WITH A "W",
TWO WITH AN "M".

311
00:14:05,142 --> 00:14:08,045
AND SO TAKE THE
TWO WITH THE "D", NO "W",

312
00:14:08,112 --> 00:14:09,346
AND GIVE THOSE TO WINSTON.

313

WINSTON --
HE'S GONNA THROW.

314

HE'S GONNA BE THE PASSER.

315
00:14:12,182 --> 00:14:13,584
THEN I TAKE THE TWO WITH
THE "D"s ON THEM

316
00:14:13,617 --> 00:14:14,919
AND I GIVE THEM TO DALTON.

317
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:16,287
DALTON'S GONNA BE
THE PUNTER.

THE PUNTER, THE KICKER --

319
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:19,123
GIVE IT A TRY THERE, DALTON.

320

THE PLACE KICKING.

324
00:14:26,363 --> 00:14:28,098
I'M NOT SURE MIKE
REALLY GRASPS

THAT WHOLE KICKER STANCE --

SO ANYWAY, SO WINSTON'S
GONNA GO FIRST.

328
00:14:35,472 --> 00:14:37,574
SO HE DOES THE
Y.A. TITTLE THING

329
00:14:37,641 --> 00:14:39,176
AND THEN HAD TO
CHANGE HIS PANTS

330
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:41,912
AND THEN HE CAME OUT
AND THREW THE FOOTBALL.

331
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:44,448

NO, NOT A BAD TOSS.

MIKE, HE PUTS HIS
ON THE TEE THERE,

AND HE'S GONNA --
OH, BOY -- OH.

A LITTLE SOMETHING
HE LEARNED IN PRISON.

AND OKAY, SO,
THEY'RE ALL PRETTY HAPPY,

347

A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED

348
00:15:20,784 --> 00:15:23,287
IN THE OVERALL QUALITY
OF THE COMPETITION.

IT'S NOT LIKE THESE
WERE THAT FAR DOWN THE FIELD.

350

SO OKAY, SO I'M SAYING YOU
GUYS GET ONE MORE BALL EACH.

LET'S PUT A LITTLE
EXTRA INTO IT.

I'LL GET RID OF THIS.

353
00:15:35,065 --> 00:15:36,466
OKAY SO WINSTON
HAS A RAMP

354
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:39,570
AND DOWN HE COMES
AND JUST REALLY LET'S HER GO.

358
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:46,877
WINSTON, I CAN'T EVEN
LOOK AT THAT.

359
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,445
NO, NO, PUT THAT AWAY.

OH, I GOTTA GET
FISH THIS FRIDAY.

361

TAPES A SLEDGEHAMMER

NOT COMPLETELY LEGAL.

HE'S JUST GONNA MAYBE

368
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:13,570
OVERINFLATE THE BALL
A LITTLE BIT.

369

THAT, SHE SHOULD TAKE OFF.

459
00:20:19,182 --> 00:20:20,750
THAT HELPED.

460
00:20:20,783 --> 00:20:22,652
WELL, HAROLD,
WHAT NOW?

461
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:24,921
I MEAN, HOW ARE WE GOING
TO PROMOTE THE LODGE
IF WE CAN'T LIE?

462
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:27,557
WELL, HOW ABOUT WE
BASE THE CAMPAIGN

463
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:30,927
ON THE LODGE'S NATURAL
BEAUTY AND SERENITY

464
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,364
AND OF COURSE THE
MAJESTY OF POSSUM LAKE.

465
00:20:38,968 --> 00:20:40,603
WE'RE SO DEAD.

466
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,438
SO DEAD.
WE'RE FINISHED.

MEETING TIME.

469
00:20:45,007 --> 00:20:46,109
YEAH, YOU GO AHEAD,
HAROLD, OKAY.

470
00:20:46,175 --> 00:20:47,076
OKAY.
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

471
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:50,747
SO IF MY WIFE
IS WATCHING,

472
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,882
THIS OLD COWPOKE WILL BE
BLAZING A TRAIL STRAIGHT HOME

473
00:20:52,949 --> 00:20:54,584
AFTER THE MEETING.

474
00:20:54,617 --> 00:20:56,552
TODAY I TRIED
TO BE LORNE GREENE,

475
00:20:56,586 --> 00:20:58,955
BUT I FOUND OUT HOW TOUGH
IT IS TO BE A STAR.

476
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:00,356
THAT'S NOT GOING
TO HAPPEN TO ME;

477
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:02,391
I'M STAYING IN CANADA.

00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:05,261
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING

480
00:21:05,294 --> 00:21:07,997
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF, HAROLD
AND THE GANG UP HERE
AT POSSUM LODGE,

481
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,665
KEEP YOUR STICK
ON THE ICE.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

483
00:21:17,273 --> 00:21:19,308
OH, HERE WE ARE, OKAY,
TAKE YOUR SEATS, PLEASE.

484
00:21:19,342 --> 00:21:21,677
SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN.
THE MEETING'S ABOUT TO BEGIN.

485
00:21:21,744 --> 00:21:23,579
ALL RISE.

486
00:21:25,948 --> 00:21:28,684
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI.

487
00:21:28,718 --> 00:21:31,254
SIT DOWN.

488
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:33,723
ALL RIGHT, MEN,
BOW YOUR HEADS

489
00:21:33,756 --> 00:21:35,124
FOR THE MAN'S PRAYER.

490
00:21:35,191 --> 00:21:37,193
I'M A MAN,
BUT I CAN CHANGE,

491
00:21:37,226 --> 00:21:40,529
IF I HAVE TO,
I GUESS.

492
00:21:40,563 --> 00:21:43,899
OKAY, GUYS, NOW THAT THE
POSSUM LODGE PONDEROSA THING

493
00:21:43,966 --> 00:21:46,135
HAS BEEN CANCELLED, WE GOT A
CHUCKWAGON TO GIVE AWAY

494
00:21:46,168 --> 00:21:47,870
IF ANYBODY'S INTERESTED.

495
00:21:47,937 --> 00:21:49,705
ANYBODY?

496
00:21:49,772 --> 00:21:51,540
OKAY, OKAY, IT'S NOT
ACTUALLY A CHUCKWAGON,

497
00:21:51,574 --> 00:21:54,910
IT'S A '79 K-CAR.

498
00:21:54,977 --> 00:21:57,213
OKAY, AND WE'VE TAKEN
THE SHOCKS OUT OF HER,

499
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,515
SO IT'S REALLY MORE OF
AN UPCHUCK WAGON.

BOB, YOU WANT TO TURN ON
YOUR HEARING AID?
