1
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,511
"IT'S THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW!"

2
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:13,246
AND NOW HERE'S A MAN
WHO LOVES THE GREAT OUTDOORS

3
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:15,215
BECAUSE THERE'S NO DOORKNOBS
TO BANG YOUR HEAD ON,

4
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:16,916
MY UNCLE,
YOUR HERO
AND HOST,

5
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:19,285
RED GRE-E-E-N!

6
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:26,726
(APPLAUSE)

7
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:31,598
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

8
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:32,532
THANK YOU.

9
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:33,933
THANK YOU. APPRECIATE IT.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,137
TOOK MY WIFE, BERNICE, OUT LAST
NIGHT FOR AN ANNIVERSARY DINNER.

11
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:41,508
YEAH, YEAH, I HEARD ALL
ABOUT YOUR KITCHEN FIRE.

12
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:44,177
WELL, I TRIED TO SURPRISE
BERNICE WITH SOME HOME COOKING,

13
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:46,746
AND I ALMOST COOKED OUR HOME.

14
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:51,184
FIRST OF ALL, NEVER
FLAMBE A WHOLE GOAT.

15
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:54,587
AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S
THE DARN COOKBOOKS NOW.

16
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:57,590
THE PRINT IS SO FINE
IN THEM, YOU KNOW?

17
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:02,128
I THOUGHT FOR SURE IT
SAID 40 OUNCES OF BRANDY.

18
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:07,100
YOU KNOW, I KNOW NOW YOU NEED A
MUCH BIGGER OVEN TO COOK
AN ENTIRE GOAT LIKE THAT.

19
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:12,705
IT ENDED UP THE TAIL GOT
HOOKED INTO THE ROTISSERIE
SOCKET THERE.

20
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:14,974
I WOUND UP WITH A
FLAMING GOAT CARCASS

21
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:19,412
DOING ABOUT 30 RPM IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE KITCHEN FLOOR.

22
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,881
I GUESS THAT'S WHY
ALL PARTIES END UP
IN THE KITCHEN.

23
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:25,084
YEAH, BOY, THAT WAS A MESS,
I'LL TELL YOU.

24
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,586
ANYWAY, I DECIDED
THE HECK WITH THAT.

25
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:27,954
I TOOK BERNICE OUT TO A MOVIE.

26
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,922
WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.

27
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:32,959
THE LAST TIME I WENT, I WENT
TO SEE "CHARIOTS OF FIRE."

28
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:38,931
NOW, I EXPECTED THAT TO BE
A REMAKE OF "BEN HUR" WITH
FLAME THROWERS.

29
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:44,704
AND THIS ONE WAS, "WHAT
DINOSAURS WOULD DO IF THEY
WERE AROUND TODAY."

30
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:48,808
I KNOW. I KNOW
WHAT THEY'D DO.

31
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:53,012
THEY'D FORM A LODGE AND THEY'D
ALL SIT AROUND AND WONDER WHY
WOMEN DON'T UNDERSTAND THEM.

32
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,922
THAT'S NOT JUST FUNNY,
IT'S WITTY.

33
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,958
DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S
NOT FUNNY ABOUT THAT?

34
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:08,428
EIGHT BUCKS.
EIGHT BUCKS!

35
00:02:08,494 --> 00:02:11,330
AND THE MOST LIKABLE CHARACTER
IN THE MOVIE WAS MADE
BY A COMPUTER

36
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,800
AND BITES PEOPLE'S HEADS OFF,

37
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:15,668
HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?

38
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,403
WELL, IT'S SIMPLE BECAUSE
HOLLYWOOD ONLY CARES
ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE

39
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,572
BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY
GO TO THE MOVIE.

40
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:26,112
THE ONLY TIME THEY GET YOUR
EIGHT BUCKS IS WHEN YOU
SET YOUR HOUSE ON FIRE
WITH GOATS.

41
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:27,613
YOU KNOW WHAT?

42
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,148
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO
MAKE A MOVIE FOR
PEOPLE LIKE ME,

43
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:30,750
AND I'M GOING TO
DO IT MYSELF.

44
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,286
ALL RIGHT.
FORREST GRUMP.

45
00:02:38,724 --> 00:02:52,338
[QUIRKY UPBEAT MUSIC]

46
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,774
HERE'S A FEW SCENES
FROM THIS WEEK'S EPISODE.

47
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,642
THAT'S OUR GAME WITH EDGAR.

48
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:59,879
AND I HAVE A HEAVY-DUTY
CAPPUCCINO/ESSPRESSO
MAKER THERE.

49
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,648
AND HERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
THAT'S REALLY HARD TO DO...

50
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:05,952
A CLEAN SHOW UNDER A
LOT OF PRESSURE.

51
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,426
WELL, THINGS ARE REALLY STARTING
TO COME TOGETHER FOR MY MOVIE.

52
00:03:13,492 --> 00:03:15,027
NO BLOOD AND GORE,
NO SPECIAL EFFECTS,

53
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,730
NO OBSCENE LANGUAGE
AND NO NUDITY.

54
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,532
Audience:  A-H-H-H!

55
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,567
WELL, NO, NO, NO.
I'VE SEEN THE KIND OF
PEOPLE AROUND HERE;

56
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:27,974
NUDITY WOULD BE
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.

57
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,241
DO YOU KNOW WHAT,
UNCLE RED?

58
00:03:29,308 --> 00:03:30,543
YOU'RE GOING TO
NEED A SCRIPT,

59
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:34,814
AND I, MYSELF, HAVE WRITTEN
OVER 38 DIFFERENT SCREENPLAYS.

60
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,883
ALMOST SELLING ONE TO THE
COMMUNITY ACCESS CHANNEL.

61
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,086
ALMOST.

62
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:41,487
PERHAPS I COULD
WRITE YOUR SCRIPT.

63
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,755
NO, I DON'T NEED
A SCRIPT, HAROLD.

64
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,090
THAT'S WHY I GOT THESE.

65
00:03:44,156 --> 00:03:45,157
I COULD USE ONE OF
THESE FOR MY SCRIPTS.

66
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:46,392
NO, NO, YOU
CAN'T DO THAT.

67
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:47,760
YOU HAVE TO, YOU KNOW,
PAY FOR THE RIGHTS
AND STUFF.

68
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,863
OH, NO, I'LL JUST CHANGE THE
STORY A BIT, YOU KNOW.

69
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,164
LOOK AT THIS THING HERE,
FOR INSTANCE.

70
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:53,399
I'LL TAKE THIS ONE.

71
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:56,268
OKAY, YOU'VE GOT A
SOUTHERN BELL NAMED

72
00:03:56,335 --> 00:03:58,838
CHARLOTTE O'HARA;

73
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:04,210
SHE FALLS IN LOVE WITH BRET
RUTLER IN THE CIVIL WAR
AND THEN --

74
00:04:04,276 --> 00:04:07,213
AND NO, NO, ATLANTIS
SINKS INTO THE SEA AND,

75
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:12,218
SHE MAKES A DRESS OUT
OF A VENETIAN BLIND.

76
00:04:12,284 --> 00:04:15,488
THAT'S "GONE WITH THE WIND,"
AND EVERYBODY IS GOING
TO KNOW IT.

77
00:04:15,554 --> 00:04:19,458
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
WE'LL JUST MAKE A STORY
ABOUT OURSELVES...

78
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,560
"THE RED GREEN STORY...

79
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:25,931
"A LITTLE GUY TRIUMPHING
OVER VERY BIG ODDS."

80
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:30,603
DON'T YOU MEAN, "THE BIG ODD GUY
TRIUMPHING OVER VERY LITTLE?"

81
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,745
YOU KNOW, HAROLD, I'M JUST
THINKING I'M GOING TO BE
CASTING FOR THE PART
OF HAROLD LATER.

82
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:42,014
YOU MIGHT WANT TO
BE A LITTLE NICER TO ME.

83
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,682
I'VE GOT TO AUDITION
TO PLAY MYSELF?

84
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:46,852
WHO COULD POSSIBLY PLAY ME?

85
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,889
YOU KNOW,
PORKY LANSFORD?

86
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:51,991
PORKY LANSFORD LOOKS
NOTHING LIKE ME.

87
00:04:52,057 --> 00:04:56,362
NO, BUT HIS WIFE IS
A DEAD RINGER.

88
00:04:57,696 --> 00:05:00,165
HEY, KIDS, CAN YOU
TURN THE MUSIC UP?

89
00:05:00,232 --> 00:05:02,501
CAN YOU PLAY THAT SONG
A BIT LOUDER?

90
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,837
CAN YOU PUMP UP THE
BASS AND THE TREBLE

91
00:05:04,903 --> 00:05:07,239
AND INCREASE THE
OUTPUT POWER?

92
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:10,009
HEY, KIDS, CAN YOU
TURN UP THE BOOM BOX?

93
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:12,544
CAN YOU FIND LOUDER
MUSIC TO PLAY?

94
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:14,880
BECAUSE I HAVE JUST DONE A
REALLY STUPID THING

95
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:20,919
AND I'D RATHER NOT HEAR
WHAT MY WIFE HAS TO SAY

96
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:23,656
IT'S THE POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

97
00:05:23,722 --> 00:05:27,426
AND THIS WEEK'S GRAND
PRIZE IS A BEAUTY.

98
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,028
OH, YEAH. THIS IS --
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS.

99
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:31,397
THIS WEEK'S GRAND PRIZE IS
FOR A PAIR OF BRASS HANDLES

100
00:05:31,463 --> 00:05:35,167
ON THE COFFIN OF YOUR CHOICE
FROM DEMPSEY'S FUNERAL HOME.

101
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,469
DEMPSEY'S, WHERE OUR
MOTTO IS, "GOOD GRIEF."

102
00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:42,307
UNCLE RED, UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE
30 SECONDS TO GET LOCAL
EXPLOSIVE EXPERT,

103
00:05:42,374 --> 00:05:45,411
THIS FELLOW HERE, Mr. EDGAR
MONTROSE, TO STAY THIS WORD.

104
00:05:45,477 --> 00:05:47,312
EDGAR, YOU'VE GOT
TO COVER YOUR EARS.

105
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:49,048
EDGAR, YOU HAVE TO
COVER YOUR EARS!

106
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:50,349
I THINK WE'RE ALL RIGHT.

107
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,484
YOU THINK WE'RE ALL RIGHT?

108
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:55,654
THE WORD IS UNSAFE.

109
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:57,589
UNSAFE.

110
00:05:57,656 --> 00:05:59,291
30 SECONDS AND GO.

111
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,827
EDGAR, EDGAR.

112
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:04,029
30 SECONDS AND GO.

113
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:06,698
I'M ALL EARS, RED.

114
00:06:06,765 --> 00:06:08,867
I KNOW, JUST NO EARDRUMS.

115
00:06:08,934 --> 00:06:12,204
YOU STAND TOO CLOSE
TO AN EXPLOSION THAT'S...

116
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:15,774
HARD ON YOUR CLOTHING.

117
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:18,977
IF YOU JUST LEAVE DYNAMITE LYING
AROUND THAT WOULD BE...

118
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:23,215
HANDY.

119
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:26,285
LET'S SAY NUTBARS AND LUNATICS
GET AHOLD OF DYNAMITE,

120
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:27,853
THEN THAT WOULD BE...

121
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,956
TEXAS.

122
00:06:35,794 --> 00:06:36,895
ALL RIGHT, TRY THIS ONE...

123
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:39,498
YOU'RE JUGGLING
BOTTLES OF NITRO,

124
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,200
YOUR CLOTHES ARE
COVERED IN GAS,

125
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:43,502
THEN IT'S...

126
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,438
OH, THE WEEKEND.

127
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:47,606
NO, NO, IT'S --

128
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,608
ALMOST OUT OF TIME,
UNCLE RED.

129
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:51,009
OKAY, OKAY.

130
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:52,010
I GOT SEVEN STICKS OF LIT
DYNAMITE IN MY MOUTH,

131
00:06:52,077 --> 00:06:53,312
MY CLOTHES ARE
COVERED IN GAS,

132
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:55,747
I'M ROARING DOWN THE HIGHWAY
ON THE ROOF OF A CAR,

133
00:06:55,814 --> 00:06:57,215
I WOULD BE...

134
00:06:57,282 --> 00:07:00,585
A COPYCAT!

135
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,823
DON'T BE STEALING
MY PARTY TRICKS, RED.

136
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,992
VERY UNSAFE.

137
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:12,064
(FRANTIC BELL RINGING)

138
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:16,802
A LOT OF PEOPLE THESE DAYS ARE
DRINKING THE ESPRESSO COFFEE.

139
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:19,204
APPARENTLY, THIS IS ENOUGH
TO FILL SOME PEOPLE UP,

140
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:21,106
BUT NOT LODGE PEOPLE.

141
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:23,008
THIS IS MORE WHAT
I HAD IN MIND,

142
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,976
IMPRESSO-ESPRESSO.

143
00:07:25,043 --> 00:07:29,114
SO THIS WEEK ON HANDYMAN CORNER,
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A
MAN-SIZED MACHINE

144
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:34,052
TO MAKE MAN-SIZED ESPRESSO OUT
OF THIS HOT WATER HEATER HERE.

145
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:37,489
SEE, THE HOT WATER HEATER IS
BUILT TO TAKE LOTS OF WATER
AND LOTS OF PRESSURE,

146
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:40,258
SORT OF LIKE THE LODGE
ON NICKEL BEER NIGHT.

147
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:42,627
SEE, THERE, YOU'VE GOT
A SAFETY VALVE, RIGHT?

148
00:07:42,694 --> 00:07:48,300
HEY, IF WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT
SAFETY, WE WOULDN'T BE
DRINKING ESPRESSO.

149
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:52,270
ALL RIGHT. WE'VE JUST GOT
TO PLUG UP THE BUNGHOLE THERE.

150
00:07:52,337 --> 00:07:54,773
WOW! NO SAFETY VALVE.

151
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,908
GETTIN' A CAFFEINE RUSH ALREADY.

152
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:58,677
NOW, ALL RIGHT DOWN HERE
IN THIS AREA,

153
00:07:58,743 --> 00:08:00,579
YOU'VE GOT YOUR THERMOSTAT.

154
00:08:00,645 --> 00:08:07,118
IT'S SET ON HIGH, BUT I'M GOING
TO SEE IF I CAN'T JUST COAX THAT
A LITTLE BIT FARTHER.

155
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:10,989
OH, BABY.

156
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:12,691
ALL RIGHT.

157
00:08:12,757 --> 00:08:14,025
WHILE THAT'S HEATING UP NOW,
I'LL START WORKING ON
THE FILTER.

158
00:08:14,092 --> 00:08:16,027
WE'VE GOT THAT UNIT SET
FOR NUCLEAR MELTDOWN,

159
00:08:16,094 --> 00:08:18,730
I'M THINKIN' PAPER FILTER
IS NOT GOING TO DO IT.

160
00:08:18,797 --> 00:08:21,132
I'D RATHER GO WITH
A CAR RADIATOR.

161
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,268
IT CAN TAKE THE HEAT
AND THE PRESSURE,

162
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:25,704
AND I'VE GOT THE BLEEDER VALVE
HERE TO DISPENSE THE COFFEE.

163
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,373
YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK I'M
GOING TO CALL THAT A
DISPENSING VALVE

164
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,941
BECAUSE WHEN I'M
WORKING ON A PROJECT,

165
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:34,579
YOU DON'T REALLY WANT
TO HEAR THE WORD "BLEEDER."

166
00:08:34,646 --> 00:08:36,147
NOW, IF YOU LIKE
YOUR MILK STEAMED,

167
00:08:36,214 --> 00:08:37,749
JUST TAKE OUT THE TANK.

168
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:41,620
THERE'S BOUND TO BE A POT
RIVET ON THERE SOMEWHERE.

169
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:43,755
OH, YES, SIR,
THAT IS HOT!

170
00:08:43,822 --> 00:08:45,290
ALL RIGHT, OUR WORK
HERE IS DONE.

171
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:47,759
LET'S HAVE SOME COFFEE.

172
00:08:47,826 --> 00:08:49,594
OH, BOY, YUP.

173
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:53,365
OH, OH, OH,
ESPRESSO.

174
00:08:53,431 --> 00:08:59,237
OH, YEAH, ALL I NEED NOW IS
JUAN VALDEZ AND HIS DONKEY HERE.

175
00:08:59,304 --> 00:09:03,108
OH, THAT LOOKS GOOD.

176
00:09:03,174 --> 00:09:07,379
NO, I THINK THE DONKEY'S
ALREADY BEEN HERE.

177
00:09:07,445 --> 00:09:10,515
OH, FOR GOD -- I FORGOT
TO PUT THE COFFEE IN.

178
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:12,317
I FORGOT THE COFFEE.

179
00:09:12,384 --> 00:09:16,154
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET
THE RAD CAP OFF HERE.

180
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:19,491
SHE'S RUSTED ON A BIT.

181
00:09:19,557 --> 00:09:23,495
OH, HERE SHE COMES.

182
00:09:23,561 --> 00:09:26,498
BOY, GOT A STING TO HER THERE.

183
00:09:26,564 --> 00:09:30,335
ALL RIGHT, NOW, YOU COULD USE
THE GOURMET COFFEE ON THIS,

184
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:33,271
BUT I THINK YOU'LL AGREE WITH
WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH IT,

185
00:09:33,338 --> 00:09:35,874
YOU'RE BETTER OFF TO GO AHEAD
WITH THE CHEAP STUFF.

186
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,576
OKAY, THERE WE GO.

187
00:09:38,643 --> 00:09:39,611
SHOULD BE ALL SET.

188
00:09:39,677 --> 00:09:40,812
AND LET'S HAVE
A LITTLE ESPRESSO.

189
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,549
GOT MY CREAM AND SUGAR.

190
00:09:46,017 --> 00:09:49,354
OH, MAN. WELL, IF THAT ISN'T THE
BEST COFFEE YOU'VE EVER TASTED,

191
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,724
THEN MY NAME IS MUD.

192
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,059
REMEMBER, IF WOMEN DON'T
FIND YOU HANDSOME,

193
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:57,362
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

194
00:09:59,898 --> 00:10:02,834
THINK I'M GONNA PAINT
THE SHED BROWN.

195
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:08,606
I WANNA TALK TO YOU OLDER GUYS
ABOUT YOUR BUSY SCHEDULE.

196
00:10:08,673 --> 00:10:10,675
I'M GUESSING YOU'RE SPENDING
A BIG PART OF YOUR DAY

197
00:10:10,742 --> 00:10:14,712
YELLING AT TEENAGERS TO TURN
THE DARN MUSIC DOWN, HUH?

198
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:15,914
I BET YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT, HEY?

199
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,482
BECAUSE 20, 30 YEARS AGO,

200
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:19,717
YOU REMEMBER, YOU USED
TO LOVE YOUR MUSIC LOUD?

201
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:24,322
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU CAN'T
STAND THEIR MUSIC THAT LOUD.

202
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:26,791
AND WHEN YOU REALIZE
YOUR HEARING IS OFF 40%,

203
00:10:26,858 --> 00:10:31,462
IMAGINE HOW LOUD
IT REALLY IS, HUH?

204
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:32,964
BUT LET'S BE HONEST HERE.

205
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:34,465
VOLUME IS NOT THE PROBLEM.

206
00:10:34,532 --> 00:10:35,833
YOU LIKE SOME THINGS LOUD...

207
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:40,772
YOUR CAR EXHAUST, MATLOCK,

208
00:10:40,838 --> 00:10:45,376
YOUNG WOMEN SAYING HOW GOOD
YOU LOOK FOR A MAN WITH
YOUR LIFESTYLE.

209
00:10:45,443 --> 00:10:47,946
THE TRUTH IS, YOU DON'T
LIKE THE NEW MUSIC LOUD

210
00:10:48,012 --> 00:10:50,348
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
LIKE THE MUSIC, PERIOD.

211
00:10:50,415 --> 00:10:52,717
SO STOP YELLING AT
THE KIDS TO TURN IT DOWN.

212
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:56,521
START YELLING AT THEM
TO TURN THE DARN STUFF OFF!

213
00:10:56,587 --> 00:10:58,556
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

214
00:10:58,623 --> 00:11:00,158
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

215
00:11:00,224 --> 00:11:02,360
(SHOUTING)
I SAID, REMEMBER,
I'M PULLING FOR YOU!

216
00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:06,431
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER!

217
00:11:08,866 --> 00:11:11,536
AUDITIONS, "BEHIND THE BEARD:
THE RED GREEN STORY,"

218
00:11:11,602 --> 00:11:14,338
TAKE 1.

219
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:17,208
I'M HAROLD GREEN, AND I AM
AUDITIONING FOR THE PART
OF HAROLD GREEN.

220
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:20,078
NEXT.

221
00:11:21,512 --> 00:11:27,118
I'M DALTON HUMPHREY, AND I AM
AUDITIONING FOR THE PART
OF HAROLD GREEN.

222
00:11:38,729 --> 00:11:42,800
WATCH OUT. THERE'S ANOTHER
WILD BEAR CHARGING YOU.

223
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:48,873
I'D HELP, BUT I'M A COWARD.

224
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,508
NEXT.

225
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:52,343
STATE YOUR NAME.

226
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:57,148
WINSTON ROTHSCHILD, AND I'M
AUDITIONING FOR THE PART
OF RED GREEN.

227
00:12:00,685 --> 00:12:02,286
DON'T WORRY, MA'AM.

228
00:12:02,353 --> 00:12:06,557
SAVING 100 ORPHANS IS
ALL IN A DAY'S WORK FOR ME,

229
00:12:06,624 --> 00:12:10,027
THE BASHFUL BACHELOR
OF POSSUM LAKE --

230
00:12:10,094 --> 00:12:13,965
NEXT.

231
00:12:14,865 --> 00:12:17,134
AND YOU, ORPHANS, REMEMBER
WHEN YOU GROW UP,

232
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:19,937
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

233
00:12:20,004 --> 00:12:21,105
NEXT.

234
00:12:21,172 --> 00:12:24,108
WHAT?
WHAT?

235
00:12:24,175 --> 00:12:29,347
I'M HAP SHAUGNESSY, AND I'M
AUDITIONING FOR THE PART OF RED.

236
00:12:31,415 --> 00:12:33,284
DON'T WORRY.
DON'T WORRY.

237
00:12:37,888 --> 00:12:41,092
UH -- THE --  PACK -- OF --
RABBID WOLVES -- ARE DEAD.

238
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,263
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER IF I
HAD SOME KIND OF WEAPON,

239
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:51,869
BUT WHAT ARE A FEW SCARS
COMPARED TO KNOWING YOU
SAVED A BUSLOAD

240
00:12:55,573 --> 00:12:57,241
OF ORPHANS?

241
00:12:57,308 --> 00:13:00,611
OH, COME ON. THE DIALOGUE
SHOULD BE BELIEVABLE.

242
00:13:00,678 --> 00:13:02,613
IT'S LIKE WHEN I WAS
WITH MERYL STREEP --

243
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,615
NEXT.

244
00:13:05,816 --> 00:13:07,985
HUH? OH, I'M EDGAR MONTROSE,

245
00:13:08,052 --> 00:13:10,988
AND I'M AUDITIONING FOR
THE PART OF BERNICE.

246
00:13:11,055 --> 00:13:13,591
NEXT!

247
00:13:16,193 --> 00:13:18,496
WE'RE AUDITIONING FOR
THE CROWD SCENE.

248
00:13:18,562 --> 00:13:20,765
NEXT.

249
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:24,001
OH, (BLEEP!)

250
00:13:32,343 --> 00:13:33,778
THIS WEEK ON
"ADVENTURES WITH BILL,"

251
00:13:33,844 --> 00:13:36,147
HE SET UP KIND OF A CHARITY
CARWASH THING,

252
00:13:36,213 --> 00:13:38,015
AND Jr. SINGLETON
HAD LEFT HIS CAR.

253
00:13:38,082 --> 00:13:40,117
THAT WAS THE FIRST ONE
WE WERE GOING TO WASH.

254
00:13:40,184 --> 00:13:48,092
BILL, THERE'S QUITE A FEW --
MAYBE TOO MANY ITEMS IS
WHAT COMES TO MY MIND.

255
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,527
MUST BE GETTING PAID BY
THE HOUR HERE,

256
00:13:49,593 --> 00:13:51,428
RATHER THAN BY THE --

257
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:53,397
BRINGS ALL THAT STUFF
AND PUTS IT IN THE GARBAGE.

258
00:13:53,464 --> 00:13:55,065
WELL, THAT MAKES A
LOT OF SENSE.

259
00:13:55,132 --> 00:13:57,601
BILL, WHY WOULD YOU --
WHY WOULD YOU --

260
00:13:57,668 --> 00:13:59,970
YEAH, YEAH. WHY WOULD YOU THROW
ALL THAT STUFF IN THE GARBAGE?

261
00:14:00,037 --> 00:14:03,774
OH. OH, MY.
OH, ALL RIGHT.

262
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:05,209
OH, YEAH, HE'S GOT ONE
OF THOSE POWER --

263
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:07,211
YOU SEEN THIS THING?
IT'S A POWER SPRAYER.

264
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:09,813
HE DOESN'T LIKE ADVICE.

265
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,417
HE JUST LIKES TO START
THINGS ON HIS OWN.

266
00:14:13,484 --> 00:14:15,152
GIVE HER A PULL THERE.

267
00:14:15,219 --> 00:14:17,121
GIVE HER ANOTHER ONE.
GIVE HER ANOTHER ONE.

268
00:14:17,187 --> 00:14:19,323
BILL, AT THIS POINT COULD --

269
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,525
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

270
00:14:23,527 --> 00:14:29,967
OH. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

271
00:14:30,034 --> 00:14:32,703
I BELIEVE THAT'S
CALLED NEMESIS.

272
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:36,073
BILL, THERE'S A LITTLE
ADJUSTMENT ON THE MACHINE,

273
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,742
IT'S CALLED THE "CHOKé."

274
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:40,010
IT'S A FRENCH WORD.

275
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:42,146
PUSH THAT AND LOOK AT THAT.

276
00:14:42,212 --> 00:14:45,149
SEE THAT? THERE YOU GO.

277
00:14:45,215 --> 00:14:46,183
YEAH, YEAH.

278
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,351
YEAH. GREAT.

279
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:48,886
ALL RIGHT, AWAY WE GO.

280
00:14:48,952 --> 00:14:52,890
THESE THINGS CAN PUT UP TO
300, 400 POUNDS OF OF PRESSURE

281
00:14:52,956 --> 00:14:56,260
WHERE IS --
I DON'T --
WHERE IS --

282
00:14:56,326 --> 00:14:57,428
WHERE IS BILL?

283
00:14:57,494 --> 00:14:59,029
WHERE IS THE SPRAYER?
WHAT HAPPENED?

284
00:14:59,096 --> 00:15:00,464
WHERE IS HE?
BILL? BILL?

285
00:15:00,531 --> 00:15:03,600
OH, HANG ON.
HANG ON.
HANG ON, BILL,

286
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:05,436
HANG ON.
HOLD HER.
HOLD HER.
HOLD HER.

287
00:15:05,502 --> 00:15:06,770
OKAY, OKAY.

288
00:15:06,837 --> 00:15:07,871
ALL RIGHT, THERE WE GO.
HERE WE GO.

289
00:15:07,938 --> 00:15:08,872
THAT'S A TWO-MAN UNIT,
RIGHT THERE.

290
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:09,873
AND NOW WE'RE REALLY SPRAYING.

291
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,608
OH, OH, MY GOLLY.

292
00:15:11,675 --> 00:15:13,777
OH, OH.

293
00:15:13,844 --> 00:15:16,313
CAN WE MAYBE TURN
THE PRESSURE--

294
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,348
BILL, BILL, DO YOU THINK --
I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD --

295
00:15:18,415 --> 00:15:21,318
I THINK WE SHOULD TURN DOWN --
I THINK WE SHOULD TURN --

296
00:15:21,385 --> 00:15:22,986
TURN -- TURN THE --

297
00:15:23,053 --> 00:15:24,288
TURN THE PRESSURE DOWN A BIT.

298
00:15:24,354 --> 00:15:25,856
WELL, WE HAVEN'T JUST
WASHED THIS CAR,

299
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:27,357
I THINK WE'VE INCREASED
HIS GAS MILEAGE

300
00:15:27,424 --> 00:15:29,560
BECAUSE SHE'S ABOUT
500 POUNDS LIGHTER.

301
00:15:29,626 --> 00:15:33,797
MAYBE CLOSING THE WINDOWS MIGHT
HAVE BEEN A PLAN.

302
00:15:33,864 --> 00:15:38,902
I JUST THOUGHT IT
WAS REALLY CLEAN.

303
00:15:38,969 --> 00:15:44,608
GEE, I HOPE Jr. PAID TO
HAVE THE INSIDE DONE TOO.

304
00:15:44,675 --> 00:15:47,611
WHAT DO WE DO NOW, BILL?

305
00:15:49,713 --> 00:15:53,584
YEAH, YEAH, WE'RE
GOING TO BLUFF.

306
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,451
(APPLAUSE)

307
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:56,520
COME ON.
COME ON.

308
00:15:56,587 --> 00:15:59,122
YOU'RE THE
RETURNING HERO.

309
00:16:06,797 --> 00:16:08,765
OKAY. WAIT.
WAIT. WAIT.

310
00:16:08,832 --> 00:16:11,969
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S GOOD.

311
00:16:12,035 --> 00:16:13,770
LOOK OUT THE
WINDOW NOW.

312
00:16:13,837 --> 00:16:15,505
WAVE GOOD-BYE
TO THE SHERIFF.

313
00:16:15,572 --> 00:16:17,040
ALL RIGHT.

314
00:16:17,107 --> 00:16:19,276
BLOW A KISS TO
THE SHERIFF'S DAUGHTER.

315
00:16:19,343 --> 00:16:21,712
SHOW HER YOUR LOVE.

316
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:24,181
NO? OKAY, GOOD CALL.

317
00:16:24,247 --> 00:16:25,649
ALL RIGHT.

318
00:16:25,716 --> 00:16:27,818
NOW LOOK AROUND
FOR YOUR UNCLE RED.

319
00:16:27,884 --> 00:16:29,886
HEY, YOU CAN'T SEE HIM.

320
00:16:29,953 --> 00:16:31,922
WHERE IS HE?

321
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:35,926
YOU REALIZE HE MUST HAVE BEEN
KILLED DURING THE FOOD FIGHT.

322
00:16:37,828 --> 00:16:39,863
YES, EXACTLY.

323
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,531
SUDDENLY YOU'RE
VERY SAD.

324
00:16:41,598 --> 00:16:44,134
PUT YOUR HAT OVER
YOUR HEART.

325
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:46,069
A COUPLE OF TEARS,
HAROLD, WOULDN'T HURT.

326
00:16:46,136 --> 00:16:46,970
MORE TEARS.

327
00:16:47,037 --> 00:16:48,972
NO, NO.

328
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:51,141
CRYING,
CRYING,
CRYING.

329
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,009
AND YOU REALIZE, HAROLD,

330
00:16:53,076 --> 00:16:55,846
YOU'VE LOST THE GREATEST
MAN WHOEVER LIVED.

331
00:16:57,214 --> 00:16:59,716
AND CUT.
AND CUT.

332
00:16:59,783 --> 00:17:01,251
ALL RIGHT. I THINK
WE'VE GOT ENOUGH.

333
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:02,519
BEAUTIFUL.

334
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:04,421
WE'VE GOT ENOUGH?

335
00:17:04,488 --> 00:17:05,889
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

336
00:17:05,956 --> 00:17:08,892
GOOD WORK.
THAT WAS GOOD.

337
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,327
IT WAS FINE.

338
00:17:10,393 --> 00:17:11,261
WE DID ENOUGH?

339
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:12,863
WE ONLY SHOT AN HOUR'S
WORTH OF FILM.

340
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:14,231
THAT'S ANOTHER
THING, HAROLD.

341
00:17:14,297 --> 00:17:15,999
I THINK THE MOVIES
TODAY ARE WAY TOO LONG.

342
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:19,536
I MEAN, HAVEN'T THESE
MOVIEMAKERS HEARD OF
KIDNEY STONES FOR GOSH SAKE?

343
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:22,539
YEAH, BUT YOU LEFT
THE LENS CAP ON FOR
THE FIRST 15 MINUTES.

344
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:25,008
I WAS JUST ESTABLISHING
THE MOOD, HAROLD.

345
00:17:25,075 --> 00:17:26,576
PLUS I CAN'T
SHOOT ANY MORE

346
00:17:26,643 --> 00:17:28,712
BECAUSE I INVITED A
DISTRIBUTOR TO COME
AND LOOK AT THIS.

347
00:17:28,778 --> 00:17:30,981
YOU INVITED A MOVIE
DISTRIBUTOR UP HERE?

348
00:17:31,047 --> 00:17:33,049
NO, WELL, HE'S AN
AUTO PARTS DISTRIBUTOR,

349
00:17:33,116 --> 00:17:38,421
BUT HE KNOWS
SOME PEOPLE.

350
00:17:38,488 --> 00:17:40,090
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT
PORTION OF THE SHOW,

351
00:17:40,156 --> 00:17:42,092
THE PART OF THE SHOW WHERE WE
EXPLORE THOSE THREE LITTLE WORDS

352
00:17:42,158 --> 00:17:44,127
THAT MEN FIND SO HARD TO SAY.

353
00:17:44,194 --> 00:17:46,897
(AUDIENCE:)
"I DON'T KNOW."

354
00:17:46,963 --> 00:17:48,832
TRES EXCELLENT.

355
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:51,234
OKAY, JOINING ME AND UNCLE
RED IN THE EXPERT PORTION
OF THE SHOW THIS WEEK

356
00:17:51,301 --> 00:17:55,505
IS A MAN WHO'S BEEN IN
THE FOREST FOR OVER
18 YEARS, RANGER GORD.

357
00:18:03,313 --> 00:18:05,949
HI, EVERYONE.
I MISSED YOU.

358
00:18:06,016 --> 00:18:08,051
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.

359
00:18:08,118 --> 00:18:09,853
OUR FIRST LETTER GOES
AS FOLLOWS:

360
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,290
"DEAR EXPERTS:  MY HUSBAND AND I
LIKE TO GO CAMPING,

361
00:18:13,356 --> 00:18:14,891
"ESPECIALLY SINCE THE RECESSION.

362
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,860
"I NOTICE THAT THE
CAMPGROUNDS --

363
00:18:16,926 --> 00:18:19,696
"I NOTICE THAT THE CAMPGROUNDS
ARE GETTING DESTROYED FROM
THOUGHTLESS CAMPERS

364
00:18:19,763 --> 00:18:22,332
"WHO I HAVE NEVER SEEN
ONCE AT OUR CHURCH.

365
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:26,102
"WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS
ON THIS MATTER?"

366
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:27,504
ALL RIGHT, WELL, THE
THING WITH GARBAGE IS

367
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,040
YOU DON'T WANT IT ALL
CONCENTRATED IN THE ONE SPOT.

368
00:18:30,106 --> 00:18:35,111
SO WHAT I DO IS I JUST PUT IT
ALL UP ON THE ROOF OF THE VAN,

369
00:18:35,178 --> 00:18:40,250
AND I MAKE SURE I LEAVE MY
CAMPSITE AT NIGHT.

370
00:18:40,316 --> 00:18:42,285
UNCLE RED, THAT'S
THOUGHTLESS.

371
00:18:42,352 --> 00:18:43,319
THAT'S CRIMINAL.

372
00:18:43,386 --> 00:18:45,255
IT'S AN ASSAULT
ON MOTHER NATURE.

373
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:51,261
OH, I'M JUST TRYING
TO GET EVEN FOR WHAT
SHE DID TO YOU.

374
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,667
NO, RED.
HAROLD IS RIGHT.

375
00:18:57,734 --> 00:19:01,571
FOLKS, WHEN YOU'RE CAMPING,
YOU'RE LIVING IN SOME
ANIMAL'S HOME.

376
00:19:01,638 --> 00:19:02,772
YOU KNOW, IT COULD
BE A SQUIRREL.

377
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,407
IT COULD BE A CHIPMUNK.

378
00:19:04,474 --> 00:19:07,243
YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE
PERSONALITIES AND FEELINGS.

379
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:11,981
OH, ESPECIALLY THE CHIPMUNK.

380
00:19:12,048 --> 00:19:16,686
ANYWAY, NO, SO YOU CAN'T JUST
DUMP GARBAGE IN THEIR HOME.

381
00:19:16,753 --> 00:19:18,588
OH, AND YOU CAN'T EAT A CHIPMUNK

382
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:24,394
BECAUSE IT WILL BE MONTHS
BEFORE THE OTHER CHIPMUNKS
WILL FORGIVE YOU.

383
00:19:31,734 --> 00:19:34,637
THAT'S CERTAINLY
GOOD ADVICE.
I KNOW.

384
00:19:34,704 --> 00:19:37,106
YEAH. SO WHEN YOU
LEAVE A CAMPSITE,

385
00:19:37,173 --> 00:19:40,677
YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU LEAVE IT EXACTLY
THE WAY YOU FOUND IT.
EXACTLY.

386
00:19:40,743 --> 00:19:43,146
YOU KNOW, PICK UP ANY
BOTTLES OR NAPKINS.

387
00:19:43,213 --> 00:19:45,949
IF YOU'VE DROPPED ANY
BREADCRUMBS, PICK THEM ALL UP.

388
00:19:46,015 --> 00:19:48,885
AND, OF COURSE, YOU HAVE TO
DOUSE THE FIRE PROPERLY.

389
00:19:48,952 --> 00:19:50,820
AND AFTER IT'S DOUSED,

390
00:19:50,887 --> 00:19:52,722
YOU PICK UP ALL THE LITTLE
PIECES OF WOOD, YOU PUT
THEM TOGETHER,

391
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:56,092
YOU FORM THEM INTO A LOG
AND REBUILD THE TREE.

392
00:19:58,227 --> 00:19:59,596
HOW THE HECK DOES
THAT WORK, GORD?

393
00:19:59,662 --> 00:20:01,497
BECAUSE THE LOGS,
MOST OF THEM, ARE BURNED
AWAY AT THAT POINT.

394
00:20:01,564 --> 00:20:03,199
RIGHT. OF COURSE,
YOU HAVE TO USE FILLER,

395
00:20:03,266 --> 00:20:11,541
AND FILLER IS MADE OUT OF PINE
CONES, SPRUCE NEEDLES AND
MUSKRAT MILK.

396
00:20:11,607 --> 00:20:13,376
MORE GOOD ADVICE.

397
00:20:13,443 --> 00:20:15,044
MAYBE NEXT TIME WHEN
RANGER GORD IS HERE,

398
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:20,183
HE CAN ACTUALLY TELL YOU HOW
TO MILK A MUSKRAT.

399
00:20:20,249 --> 00:20:24,520
WELL, CERTAINLY NOT
ON A FIRST DATE.

400
00:20:26,923 --> 00:20:30,326
YEAH, I'LL NEVER
DO THAT AGAIN.

401
00:20:40,737 --> 00:20:45,174
WHO BRINGS TOMATOES TO
A MOVIE THEATRE?

402
00:20:45,241 --> 00:20:46,709
I WOULDN'T CALL THAT
A MOVIE THEATRE;

403
00:20:46,776 --> 00:20:49,445
THAT WAS A VEGETABLE
BARN, THAT WAS.

404
00:20:49,512 --> 00:20:52,482
JUST BE THANKFUL IT WASN'T
WATERMELON SEASON.

405
00:20:52,548 --> 00:20:53,749
YOU BROUGHT IT
ON YOURSELF.

406
00:20:53,816 --> 00:20:55,051
YOU DID,
YOU DID,
YOU DID.

407
00:20:55,118 --> 00:20:56,352
WITH ALL THOSE CREDITS
IN THE MOVIE...

408
00:20:56,419 --> 00:20:58,588
WRITTEN BY RED GREEN,
CONCEIVED BY RED GREEN,

409
00:20:58,654 --> 00:21:00,723
STARRING RED GREEN,
DIRECTED BY RED GREEN,

410
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:01,958
KEY GRIP... RED GREEN.

411
00:21:02,024 --> 00:21:07,096
GET A GRIP, RED GREEN!

412
00:21:12,468 --> 00:21:18,374
BUT, YOU KNOW -- YOU DIDN'T
EVEN GIVE THAT MOVIE
A CHANCE, HAROLD.

413
00:21:18,441 --> 00:21:19,742
WELL, I KNOW.
I KNOW.

414
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:21,410
CRITICISM CAN BE HURTFUL.

415
00:21:21,477 --> 00:21:25,214
IT CAN BE, YES.
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

416
00:21:25,281 --> 00:21:28,050
YEAH,
YEAH,
YEAH.

417
00:21:28,117 --> 00:21:31,921
YEAH, YEAH.
I'M GLAD I COULD
SNAP YOU OUT OF IT.

418
00:21:31,988 --> 00:21:33,823
AND YOU LEARN SOMETHING
FROM IT SOMETIMES TOO.

419
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,092
YEAH, I LEARNED --
I LEARNED SOMETHING.

420
00:21:36,158 --> 00:21:38,361
I LEARNED YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE A HOLLYWOOD
HOT SHOT,

421
00:21:38,427 --> 00:21:40,429
SPENDING MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS TO MAKE
A BAD MOVIE.

422
00:21:40,496 --> 00:21:44,000
I CAN DO IT RIGHT HERE
FOR NEXT TO NOTHING.

423
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:46,369
WELL, MAYBE NEXT TIME
SOMEBODY WANTS TO MAKE
A REALLY BAD MOVIE,

424
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:47,570
MAYBE THEY'LL CALL YA.

425
00:21:47,637 --> 00:21:48,638
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

426
00:21:48,704 --> 00:21:50,406
(POSSUM CALL)

427
00:21:50,473 --> 00:21:51,974
OH, OH, MEETING TIME,
UNCLE RED.

428
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:55,211
AWAY YOU GO, HAROLD.

429
00:21:56,145 --> 00:21:58,214
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT
HOME AFTER THE MEETIN',

430
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,683
AND SORRY ABOUT THE
MESS ON MY CLOTHES.

431
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,051
I TRIED TO MAKE A
SPAGHETTI WESTERN,

432
00:22:02,118 --> 00:22:05,254
ENDED UP WITH A FACE FULL
OF TOMATO SAUCE.

433
00:22:05,321 --> 00:22:06,522
THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING,

434
00:22:06,589 --> 00:22:08,357
AND ON BEHALF OF
MYSELF AND HAROLD

435
00:22:08,424 --> 00:22:10,593
AND THE WHOLE GANG UP HERE
AT POSSUM LODGE,

436
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:14,363
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

437
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:22,138
[CAPTIONS PERFORMED BY
CAPTION RESOURCE CENTER]

438
00:22:22,204 --> 00:22:23,606
Harold: EVERYBODY
TAKE THEIR SEAT.

439
00:22:23,672 --> 00:22:25,775
SIT DOWN.
HAVE A SEAT.

440
00:22:25,841 --> 00:22:32,047
ALL RISE.

441
00:22:32,114 --> 00:22:35,117
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI.

442
00:22:35,184 --> 00:22:38,587
Red: SIT DOWN.

443
00:22:38,654 --> 00:22:40,456
Harold:  OKEY DOKEY, WE JUST
HAVE THE ONE ANNOUNCEMENT
TONIGHT.

444
00:22:40,523 --> 00:22:45,060
IT'S FROM WINSTON ROTHCHILD
OF ROTHCHILD SEWAGE AND SEPTIC
SUCKING SERVICES.

445
00:22:45,127 --> 00:22:47,997
HE WANTS TO REMIND ALL OF US
THAT WITH CORN ON THE COB SEASON
HERE AND THE HIGH TEMPERATURES,

446
00:22:48,063 --> 00:22:50,766
MAKE SURE YOUR HOLDING
TANKS ARE WELL VENTED.

447
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:55,204
WHY DO I READ THESE?

448
00:22:55,271 --> 00:22:59,575
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

449
00:22:59,642 --> 00:23:03,879
SOMEONE'S GOT TO PROOFREAD
THESE BEFORE I START DOING IT.

450
00:23:03,946 --> 00:23:06,248
BUT IT'S GOOD ADVICE THOUGH,
YOU KNOW.

451
00:23:06,315 --> 00:23:09,385
IT IS A HIGH SEASON,
SO TO SPEAK.
