1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:04,604
I KNOW IT'S GREAT TO BE REASONABLE 
AND RATIONAL

2
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:08,908
DISCUSS THINGS, TRY TO ARRIVE
AT AN ACCEPTABLE COMPROMISE

3
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:11,077
THAT EVERYBODY
CAN LIVE WITH.

4
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:14,447
BUT ONCE IN A WHILE,
WHEN YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH,

5
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,816
YOU'VE GOTTA TAKE ACTION.

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,720
YOU'VE MADE YOUR POINT;
THEY UNDERSTAND YOUR POSITION;

7
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:23,757
AND YET NOTHING CHANGES.

8
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:28,228
AND THAT MOVES YOU FROM
THE ARENA OF DIPLOMATIC
CONCILIATION

9
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:31,631
INTO THE AREA OF A TASTE
OF YOUR OWN MEDICINE.

10
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:42,509
[distorted voice]

11
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:47,514
[distorted]

12
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:53,787
[distorted]

13
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:57,791
[distorted]

14
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:14,040
[cheers and applause]

15
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,341
ALL RIGHT

16
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:17,577
THANK YOU VERY MUCH

17
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:20,046
THANK YOU.

18
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:22,482
YEAH, I APPRECIATE THAT.

19
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,884
WELL, I'M AFRAID
I GOT NO NEWS FOR YOU.

20
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:27,487
THAT'S BECAUSE OUR LOCAL
PAPER, "THE DAILY MOVEMENT,"

21
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:29,355
IS SHUT DOWN FOR TWO WEEKS.

22
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:31,191
I FIGURE PEOPLE
ARE GONNA MISS IT.

23
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:34,461
THAT'S A LONG TIME TO GO
WITHOUT A "DAILY MOVEMENT."

24
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:36,396
HEY, RED,

25
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:37,530
THERE'S NO
PAPER THIS WEEK.

26
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,533
NO, NO, THE PUBLISHER,
THE EDITOR, THE REPORTER,

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,735
THE PHOTOGRAPHER,
THE CARTOONIST AND
THE TYPESETTER

28
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,270
HAVE ALL GONE
ON VACATION.

29
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:44,637
BUT DON'T WORRY.

30
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,840
HE'LL BE BACK IN
TWO WEEKS.

31
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:48,641
OKAY, I WISH SOMEBODY
WOULDA TOLD ME THAT

32
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:50,977
BECAUSE NOW NO ONE'S
GONNA SEE MY AD.

33
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,146
YOU DON'T NEED TO
RUN AN AD, WINSTON.

34
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:56,816
I MEAN, THAT TRUCK OF
YOURS IS AN EXCELLENT
MARKETING TOOL.

35
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,085
AND THAT THING ASSAULTS
ALL FIVE SENSES

36
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,087
EVERY TIME YOU DO
A DRIVE-BY.

37
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,356
RED, IT'S NOT AN
AD FOR MY BUSINESS;

38
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:04,924
IT'S -- IT'S MORE OF
A PERSONAL AD.

39
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:07,527
SEE, I'M LOOKIN' FOR
A WOMAN WHO'D BE WILLING

40
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,796
TO HAVE MY BABY.

41
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:14,267
YOU KNOW, I DON'T
THINK A LOCAL AD
IS GONNA WORK.

42
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:19,572
I THINK YOU NEED TO
ADVERTISE WHERE THE
WOMEN DON'T KNOW YOU.

43
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:22,142
WHY THIS SUDDEN URGE
TO BE A FATHER?

44
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:24,444
RED, I'M WINSTON
ROTHSCHILD III.

45
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,946
SEE, IT'S TAKEN THREE
GENERATIONS TO BUILD

46
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,082
THIS SEPTIC
SUCKING DYNASTY,

47
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,284
AND I CAN'T LET IT
END WITH ME.

48
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,654
AND BESIDES, I PROMISED MY DAD
THAT I'D MAKE SURE THIS
COMPANY KEEPS GOING

49
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:37,157
AS LONG AS THE
CUSTOMERS KEEP GOING.

50
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,761
MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE
USING SCIENCE ON THIS.

51
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:44,364
THEY HAVE THIS SURROGATE
MOTHER THING NOW,

52
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,366
WHERE THEY TAKE A SAMPLE FROM
YOU AND THEY IMPLANT IT

53
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,968
INTO A WOMAN AND SHE DELIVERS
A BABY NINE MONTHS LATER

54
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,436
FOR A FEE.

55
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,771
YOU KNOW WHAT?

56
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:53,973
DALTON'S DAUGHTER MIGHT
BE INTERESTED IN THAT.

57
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,942
AH, NO THANKS, RED.

58
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,678
I MEAN, WHAT IF THE KID
INHERITED MY HEIGHT
AND DALTON'S HAIR?

59
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:01,147
IT'D BE A TROLL.

60
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,084
NO, I'M KINDA LEANIN'
TOWARDS ADOPTION.

61
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,353
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE,

62
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,889
GENETICALLY SPEAKING.

63
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,925
'CAUSE I THINK
THERE'S GOTTA
BE A FUTURE

64
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,961
WINSTON ROTHSCHILD IV
OUT THERE SOMEWHERE.

65
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,063
ACTUALLY, I'VE GOT AN
APPOINTMENT WITH THE
ADOPTION AGENCY

66
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,865
IN ABOUT A HALF
AN HOUR,

67
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,667
AND I WAS HOPING YOU'D
TAG ALONG AND, YOU KNOW,

68
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,135
SORT OF VOUCH FOR ME.

69
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:23,670
OH, SURE.
SURE, YEAH.

70
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,438
SO WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A BABY

71
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,640
WHO COULD POSSIBLY BE
IN THE SEWAGE BUSINESS?

72
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,543
RED, ALL BABIES ARE
IN THE SEWAGE BUSINESS.

73
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,746
[applause]

74
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,822
IT'S TIME FOR THE
POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

75
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:47,660
[cheers and applause]

76
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,698
AND TODAY'S WINNER WILL
RECEIVE THIS BEAUTIFUL

77
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:54,000
MONOGRAMMED HANDKERCHIEF.

78
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,736
I ALREADY HAVE
A MONOGRAMMED
HANDKERCHIEF.

79
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,138
YEAH, BUT THIS'LL HAVE YOUR
INITIALS ON IT.

80
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,408
OKAY, COVER YOUR
EARS, MIKE.

81
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:05,378
RED, YOU'VE GOT 30 SECONDS TO
GET MIKE TO SAY THIS WORD...

82
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:08,348
LIGHT

83
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,016
LIGHT

84
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,551
YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
DALTON.

85
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,785
AND GO!

86
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,320
OKAY, MIKE,

87
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,522
AT NIGHT IT'S DARK,
SO IN THE DAY IT'S...

88
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,791
EASIER TO GET CAUGHT.

89
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,428
OKAY, WHEN A
ROOM GETS DARK,

90
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:23,896
IT'S TIME TO
TURN ON THE...

91
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,765
CHARM.

92
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,702
OKAY, YOU SEE A GUY,

93
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,504
AND SUDDENLY HE
GETS RELIGION,

94
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:32,972
YOU FIGURE HE
MUST'VE SEEN THE...

95
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,907
ELECTRIC CHAIR.

96
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,144
LET'S TRY THIS.

97
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,313
WHICH BEER DO
FAT PEOPLE DRINK?

98
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,315
THE LAST ONE.

99
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,285
TIME'S ALMOST UP RED
YEAH. OKAY

100
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,453
OKAY, MIKE, IF SOMETHING'S
NOT HEAVY, IT'S...

101
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,789
EASY TO STEAL.

102
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,225
OH, YEAH, ESPECIALLY
IF YOU'RE LIGHT FINGERED.

103
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,660
THAT'S IT!

104
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,663
[applause]

105
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,604
[loon calls]

106
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,240
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
REGRETS THE OTHER DAY.

107
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,609
DO YOU HAVE ANY
REGRETS, MR. GREEN?

108
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:12,211
WELL NONE SO FAR 
BUT THIS CONVERSATION HAS POTENCIAL

109
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:13,546
[laughter]

110
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:14,514
WHAT ABOUT YOU,
MR. HUMPHREY?

111
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:15,481
ANY REGRETS?

112
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,817
I'VE GOT NOTHING
BUT REGRETS.

113
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,218
HOW ABOUT YOU, MIKE?

114
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:20,687
YOU MUST HAVE A
TONNE OF REGRETS.

115
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:21,654
WELL, ONLY ONE...

116
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,324
CHILDREN.
I REGRET NOT
HAVING ANY CHILDREN.

117
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,260
YEAH, I FEEL
EXACTLY THE SAME WAY.

118
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:31,230
OH, OR DID YOU SAY YOU REGRET
'NOT' HAVING CHILDREN?

119
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:33,833
YOU KNOW, BERNICE AND I
DON'T HAVE ANY KIDS.

120
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,035
WE TRIED FOR
A COUPLE YEARS.

121
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:39,572
THEN MY BROTHER HAD HAROLD,
AND WE TOOK THAT AS A WARNING.

122
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,475
OH, I'D LIKE TO HAVE
LOTS OF CHILDREN.

123
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,277
YOUR PARENTS HAVE
LOTS OF KIDS, MIKE?

124
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,845
MY MOM DID.

125
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,614
MY DAD DIDN'T
HAVE ANY KIDS.

126
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,784
I DON'T THINK
HE WAS MY DAD.

127
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,721
WELL, KIDS ARE A LOTTA
RESPONSIBILITY, MIKE.

128
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,656
YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER,
DON'T YOU, DALTON?

129
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,558
YES, YES,
YES, I DO.

130
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,626
YES, I HAVE A
DAUGHTER.

131
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,995
THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN
WEARING THE SAME CLOTHES

132
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,597
FOR THE LAST
12 YEARS.

133
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,065
BUT KIDS ARE SO GREAT!

134
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,400
THEY'RE SO INNOCENT;

135
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,469
THEY'RE SO FULL OF
HOPE FOR THE FUTURE.

136
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,003
YOU KNOW,
IF I'D HAD KIDS,

137
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,439
I DON'T THINK I'D EVER HAVE
BEEN IN TROUBLE WITH THE LAW.

138
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,274
HOW OLD WERE YOU
ON YOUR FIRST ARREST?

139
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,110
ELEVEN.

140
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,945
THAT'S A PRETTY
YOUNG FATHER.

141
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,314
YOU MIGHT WANNA THINK ABOUT
GETTING A LIFE PARTNER

142
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,016
BEFORE YOU LEAP RIGHT INTO
HAVING A FAMILY, YOU KNOW?

143
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,152
THERE STILL HAS TO
BE A WOMAN INVOLVED
IN HAVING KIDS,

144
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,987
DOESN'T THERE?

145
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,390
YOU DON'T JUST DOWNLOAD
IT OFF THE INTERNET.

146
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,458
NO, NO, KIDS ARE GREAT.

147
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,694
IF YOU HAVE A SON
OR A DAUGHTER,

148
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,196
IT'S KINDA LIKE A PROMISE
THAT YOU'RE GONNA RAISE
'EM PROPERLY

149
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,499
AND YOU'RE GONNA TAKE CARE
OF 'EM UNTIL THEY'RE
ON THEIR OWN.

150
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,034
[scoffs]
THEY'LL NEVER
BE ON THEIR OWN.

151
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,537
ARE YOU PREPARED
FOR THAT ONE, MIKE?

152
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,606
I JUST WANNA HAVE KIDS.

153
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,841
THEY'LL LEARN
TO BE GOOD PEOPLE.

154
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,078
WELL, THEY LEARN MAINLY
FROM YOUR EXAMPLE.

155
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,947
WELL, THAT'S A
DUMB SYSTEM!

156
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,550
[applause]

157
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,152
YOU KNOW, MY DAD
USED TO TELL ME

158
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,087
A MAN'S HOME IS HIS CASTLE.

159
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,789
HE ALSO TOLD ME
TO LEARN ESPERANTO

160
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,824
AND BUY AN AMPHIBIOUS CAR.

161
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,392
MY DAD WAS WRONG.

162
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,161
THE ONLY TIME A MAN'S
HOME IS HIS CASTLE

163
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,596
IS WHEN THE QUEEN
IS OUT AT THE MALL.

164
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:12,432
SO TODAY ON HANDYMAN CORNER,

165
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,100
I'M HERE TO PROVE THAT

166
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,035
ALTHOUGH A MAN'S HOME
IS NOT HIS CASTLE,

167
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,271
HIS CAR IS HIS COTTAGE.

168
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,808
OKAY, AS ALWAYS, WHEN YOU'RE
DOING A MAJOR RENOVATION,

169
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:24,744
THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO DO
IS GUT THE WHOLE INTERIOR.

170
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,946
YOU WANNA DO THIS
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE,

171
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,848
BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE THE
TIME TO DO IT PROPERLY

172
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,751
YOU'LL JUST GET BORED AND
ABANDON THE WHOLE PROJECT.

173
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,986
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN GUYS DO THINGS RIGHT.

174
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,588
WHENEVER YOU SEE
A HALF-PAINTED BOAT

175
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,291
OR A PARTLY
CONVERTED SCHOOL BUS
IN A GUY'S BACKYARD,

176
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:41,027
THAT'S THE PRICE OF
BEING A PERFECTIONIST.

177
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,474
YOU WANNA KEEP
THE SEATS, THOUGH.

178
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,709
THEY MAKE GREAT COUCHES
FOR YOUR CASTLE.

179
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,011
MAYBE PUT 'EM IN
THE SERVANTS' QUARTERS.

180
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:02,648
FOUND A FAIR BIT OF FOOD AND
GARBAGE UNDER THE SEATS
AND WHAT HAVE YOU,

181
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:06,586
SPILLED DRINKS, TACO JUICE,
THAT KIND OF THING.

182
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,956
OH, MAN!
LOOK AT ALL THE COINS.

183
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:13,493
CAN'T REALLY CALL
IT LOOSE CHANGE.

184
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,329
OKAY, ONCE YOU'VE GOT
THE SPACE ALL CLEARED OUT,

185
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,464
YOU'RE READY FOR THE MOST
IMPORTANT PIECE OF FURNITURE.

186
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,268
IT'S AN OLD
BARBER'S CHAIR.

187
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,636
I MEAN, IT'S PERFECT...

188
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,238
IT SWIVELS, IT RECLINES,

189
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,639
THE FOOTREST COMES UP.

190
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,007
AND LET'S FACE IT.

191
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,142
AT OUR AGE WE'RE NOT USING
IT AS A BARBER'S CHAIR

192
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,711
NEARLY AS OFTEN
AS WE USED TO.

193
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,183
[grunting]

194
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,287
YOU KNOW, A ONE-SEATER CAR
MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ME.

195
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,788
IT'S A LITTLE HARDER TO
REACH THE PEDALS,

196
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,991
BUT YOU DON'T NEED ANY OF
THOSE SIDE AIR BAGS, EH?

197
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,292
AND LOOK WHERE
YOU'RE SITTING.

198
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,594
YOU'RE RIGHT IN FRONT OF
THE HEATER CONTROL AND RADIO.

199
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,030
THAT'S A LOT MORE INTERESTING
THAN WATCHING THE ROAD.

200
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,399
LET ME SHOW YOU
THE FAMILY ROOM.

201
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,103
I'VE GOT MY
MICROWAVE BACK THERE,

202
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,671
TV, MINI FRIDGE.

203
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,373
AND WITH OPEN
ACCESS TO THE TRUNK,

204
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,708
IT'S VERY PRIVATE AND
THERE'S PLENTY OF LEG ROOM.

205
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:05,244
PLUS, I HAVE TWO GARBAGE
CANS IN THE UNIT.

206
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,647
I BELIEVE THEY'RE
CALLED WINDOWS.

207
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,815
OH, YEAH, WE'RE A LITTLE SHY
IN THE HEADROOM BACK THERE.

208
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:13,452
ALL I DO IS USE THIS BOAT
HOOK TO GET MYSELF A
MICROWAVE POPCORN

209
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,988
OR THE SAFETY BEVERAGE
THAT GOES WITH IT.

210
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,959
NO, A MAN'S HOUSE
IS NOT HIS CASTLE;

211
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,094
BUT MAYBE HIS CAR IS.

212
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:24,830
AND WITH THE SUN ROOF
AND THIS ROPE LADDER

213
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,400
THIS CASTLE EVEN
HAS A TURRET.

214
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,603
ISN'T THIS A
GREAT SET-UP?

215
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,705
I CAN STAND UP HERE
IN MY TURRET

216
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,308
AND SURVEY MY
ENTIRE KINGDOM.

217
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,809
I CALL IT A TURRET,

218
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,678
BUT SOME PEOPLE
CALL IT WIDOW'S WALK.

219
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,479
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY.

220
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:43,316
OH, FORGOT MY COFFEE.
NO PROBLEM.

221
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,451
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

222
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,820
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

223
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:50,923
[music playing on radio]

224
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:04,437
[applause]

225
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:13,112
I WANNA TAKE A MINUTE TO TALK
ABOUT THE PARENT PROBLEM.

226
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,081
NOW, I DON'T MEAN
THE PARENTING PROBLEM,

227
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:17,483
WHEN YOUR KIDS COME
HOME WITH BLUE HAIR.

228
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,185
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE PARENT PROBLEM,

229
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,754
WHEN YOUR AGING MOM
AND DAD COME HOME WITH --

230
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,756
WELL, WITH BLUE HAIR.

231
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,525
YOU KNOW, IT'S A FACT OF LIFE
THAT WHEN SENIOR CITIZENS

232
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,427
CAN'T TAKE CARE OF
THEMSELVES ANYMORE,

233
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,564
THEY OFTEN MOVE IN WITH THEIR
OWN MIDDLE-AGED KIDS.

234
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:34,133
THAT CAN BE REAL TOUGH
ON SOME OF YOU LATE BLOOMERS

235
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,336
WHO JUST MOVED OUTTA THEIR
HOUSE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.

236
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,338
BUT EITHER WAY,
YOU AND YOUR PARENTS

237
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:40,973
HAVE DIFFERENT LIFESTYLES.

238
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:44,110
SO THE WATCHWORD
HERE IS PATIENCE.

239
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,979
YOU MAY NOT UNDERSTAND WHY
ANYONE NEEDS TO BE UP
FOR THE DAY

240
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:49,382
AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING.

241
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:52,785
BUT THEN YOU'VE NEVER EATEN
SUPPER AT 3:00 IN
THE AFTERNOON

242
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:55,554
JUST TO SAVE A
BUCK AND A HALF.

243
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,058
LIKEWISE, TRY NOT
TO GET UPSET

244
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,093
WHEN THEY START COMPLAINING
ABOUT YOUR FOOD

245
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,762
OR THE WALLPAPER
IN THEIR ROOM

246
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:05,231
OR THE TEMPERATURE
OF THE HOUSE.

247
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:08,567
IT'S JUST THEIR WAY OF
TELLING YOU THEY LOVE YOU,

248
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,337
AND THAT YOU KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT ANYTHING.

249
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:12,872
OH, YEAH,

250
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:15,574
AND THERE MAY BE
SOME ROLE REVERSAL INVOLVED

251
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:18,244
REMEMBER HOW ANNOYED YOU USED
TO GET WHEN YOU WERE A KID

252
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,613
AND THEY'D TELL YOU
TURN DOWN THE TV?

253
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,682
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA
UNDERSTAND HOW THEY FELT

254
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,050
WHEN YOU START
HEARING ANDY ROONEY

255
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,153
AT A 120 DECIBELS.

256
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:30,122
THE MAIN THING IS DON'T
LOOK AT THIS AS A CRISIS;

257
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,692
THINK OF IT AS A
LEARNING OPPORTUNITY.

258
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,061
HERE'S A CHANCE
TO SHOW YOUR OWN KIDS

259
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:38,164
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO THEM
IF THEY DON'T GET SMART

260
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,533
AND START SAVING FOR YOUR
RETIREMENT HOME IN FLORIDA

261
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,802
RIGHT NOW.

262
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,370
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING
FOR YOU.

263
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:45,204
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

264
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:48,708
[applause]

265
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,979
WELL, WINSTON AND I WENT
DOWN TO THE ADOPTION AGENCY.

266
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,514
WE WERE HOPING TO
FIND HIM A CHILD

267
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:58,718
SO HIS FAMILY SEPTIC BUSINESS
WOULDN'T GO DOWN THE DRAIN.

268
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,520
WELL, IT DIDN'T
GO REAL WELL.

269
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:03,689
HEY, RED,
GOOD NEWS!

270
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,758
THEY WANNA SEE US
DOWN AT CITY HALL.

271
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,660
YEAH, SOME BIG
ANNOUNCEMENT OR SOMETHING.

272
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,729
THERE'LL BE A WHOLE BUNCH OF
US WHO ARE LOOKIN' TO ADOPT.

273
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:11,363
WELL, I DON'T THINK YOU
HAVE A CHANCE, WINSTON.

274
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:13,132
WELL, THAT'S
NEGATIVE, RED.

275
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,734
I THOUGHT OUR INTERVIEW
WENT REALLY WELL.

276
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,836
NO, NO, NO.

277
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,206
GOOD INTERVIEWS GO MORE THAN
THREE MINUTES, WINSTON.

278
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,975
WE WEREN'T IN THERE LONG
ENOUGH TO BOIL AN EGG.

279
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:23,509
WELL, MAYBE NOT,

280
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,610
BUT YOU SURE
SCRAMBLED A FEW.

281
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,312
WELL, I COULDN'T
LIE TO THEM.

282
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,446
WELL, NO,
NOT LIE.

283
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,381
NEVER LIE.

284
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,383
EMBELLISH,
MAYBE.

285
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,185
PUT A NICE
SPIN ON SOME OF
THE ANSWERS PERHAPS.

286
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,721
WINSTON, YOU'RE
A 35-YEAR-OLD BACHELOR

287
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,424
WHO SPENDS 18 HOURS A
DAY IN YOUR SEWAGE TRUCK.

288
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,392
I'D HIRE A NANNY.
I TOLD THEM THAT.

289
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:43,896
YOU TOLD THEM
I WAS THE NANNY!

290
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,731
I CAN'T RELATE
TO BABIES.

291
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,299
OH, SURE
YOU CAN, RED.

292
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:48,968
DON'T SELL
YOURSELF SHORT.

293
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,669
YOU'VE GOT A LOT
IN COMMON WITH A BABY...

294
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:53,439
SOFT HEAD,
TAKE A LOT OF NAPS.

295
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,641
I'M THE LEADER
OF POSSUM LODGE.

296
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,610
I'VE GOT ALL THE
CHILDREN I CAN HANDLE.

297
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:00,446
LOOK, RED, JUST COME DOWN
WITH ME FOR THE BIG
ANNOUNCEMENT.

298
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,214
THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH
OF US WHO GOT TURNED DOWN,

299
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,350
AND WE JUST WANNA
STAGE A LITTLE PROTEST

300
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,318
AND MAYBE THEY'LL
CHANGE THEIR MIND.

301
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,120
AND LOOK,
IF THIS DOESN'T WORK,

302
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,256
I PROMISE IT'S
THE END OF IT.

303
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:11,991
WELL, SOUNDS LIKE A
WASTE OF TIME TO ME.

304
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,592
I'VE BEEN MARRIED
35 YEARS.

305
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,294
PROTESTS DON'T WORK.

306
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,096
LOOK, I'LL DO THE YELLING.

307
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,531
YOU JUST COME ALONG
FOR MORAL SUPPORT.

308
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,566
COME ON,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

309
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,834
ALL RIGHT.

310
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,569
RED, LOOK, I GOTTA
HAVE THIS BABY.

311
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:24,970
I NEED AN HEIR.

312
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:26,238
YOU HAVE AN HEIR;
WHAT YOU NEED
IS A SHOWER.

313
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,508
[laughter]

314
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:33,145
Red: WE DECIDED TO
HAVE A LITTLE BASKETBALL
SHOOTING COMPETITION

315
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:33,946
BETWEEN MIKE AND WALTER,

316
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:36,782
AND I WAS PUTTING DOWN THE
THREE-POINT LINE

317
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:39,218
DOWN AT THE BASKETBALL
COURT IN TOWN THERE.

318
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,053
OF COURSE, WALTER HAD
THE FULL GEAR ON,

319
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,855
SO MIKE'S TRYING TO ADAPT
HIS OUTFIT TO MATCH --

320
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,490
WOW! HE'S GOT THE
TEAR-AWAY PANTS.

321
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,193
MIKE DOESN'T HAVE --
OH, YES, HE DOES.

322
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:50,663
THOSE LEGS ARE PRETTY
DARNED WHITE OVER THERE.

323
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,199
SO I WAS EXPLAINING I HAD
DONE THE THREE-POINT

324
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,601
ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL
RULE BOOK OF PRO BASKETBALL.

325
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,903
SO WALTER'S GONNA GO FIRST.

326
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,841
WE'RE GONNA GIVE TWO
POINTS A PIECE FOR THESE.

327
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,043
THAT'S A LITTLE SHORT.
LITTLE SHORT THERE, WALTER.

328
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,945
LET'S SEE HOW MIKE CAN DO.

329
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,447
OBVIOUSLY HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY
FRICTION TO HOLD HIM BACK.

330
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,649
OKAY, VERY SIMILAR
TYPE OF SHOT,

331
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,085
SO THAT'D BE
ZERO-ZERO SO FAR.

332
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:16,255
SO I'M THINKING LET'S
MAKE THIS A LITTLE EASIER.

333
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,224
INSTEAD OF GOING
WITH PRO BASKETBALL,

334
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,427
LET'S GO WITH THE COLLEGE
BASKETBALL HANDBOOK.

335
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,229
GOT A LITTLE CLOSER LINE.

336
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,030
SO AGAIN WALTER GOES.

337
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,732
THIS SHOULD GO
A LOT BETTER.

338
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,367
I'M FEELING REALLY
GOOD ABOUT THIS.

339
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,636
OKAY, AWAY YOU GO.
SHOOT HER UP THERE.

340
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,404
NOPE.
NO BETTER.

341
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,608
SO NOW MIKE TRIES
A DIFFERENT APPROACH,

342
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,776
THE UNDERHAND, GIRLIE
APPROACH HE LEARNED IN PRISON

343
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:41,113
AND YOU SEE,
HE SHOT IT BACK -- OH!

344
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,683
ALL RIGHT, SO HE TOOK
THE ARIEL OFF THE VAN,

345
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,218
AND HE WRECKED THE BALL.

346
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,887
NOW WALTER'S FIGURING HE
SHOULD WIN BY DEFAULT,

347
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,889
BECAUSE THERE CAN
BE NO MORE COMPETITION

348
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,290
BECAUSE WE DON'T
HAVE A BALL.

349
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:52,858
MIKE SAYS, WAIT A SEC.
I'LL GET ANOTHER BALL.

350
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,693
DON'T YOU WORRY.

351
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,229
SO HE SEES -- THERE'S SOME
POOR LITTLE KID PLAYING
TETHER BALL,

352
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,131
AND NOT BOTHERING ANYBODY.

353
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,401
AND MIKE COMES IN,
AND THIS IS CALLED BARTER

354
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,637
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO
ARE NEW TO THE COUNTRY.

355
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,172
AND TAKES THAT,
AND HE'S GONE.

356
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,741
SO HE COMES BACK.

357
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:11,243
NOW I'M ABANDONING THE
COLLEGE LINE.

358
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,180
WE'RE GOING TODDLERS -- THE
TODDLERS THREE-POINT LINE.

359
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,783
OH!
HERE'S MIKE.

360
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,152
MIKE'S ALL SET.

361
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,321
AND UP AND...

362
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:23,689
AND IT'S GOOD!

363
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,592
YEAH, TWO POINTS.
ALL RIGHT.

364
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,061
SO WALTER, NO PROBLEM.
LET'S SEE HOW HE DOES.

365
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,095
HE'S GONNA SHOW OFF
A LITTLE BIT.

366
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,999
INSTEAD OF DOING A JUMP SHOT,
HE'S GONNA DO THE KAREEM
ABDUL-JABBAR HOOK JOB.

367
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,234
PERFECT!
THERE'S TWO.

368
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,336
WELL, WE'RE ALL
TIED UP AT TWO POINTS.

369
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,538
OH, NO, WE DON'T NEED THAT.
DON'T NEED ANY OF THAT.

370
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,941
THERE'S NO NEED FOR
THAT KIND OF THING.

371
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,109
SO MIKE'S GOT A PLAN.
HE GOES -- THANK YOU.

372
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,478
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MIKE.

373
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:46,879
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

374
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,248
OH, IT'S SOME KIND OF
A TRICK SHOT, I'M THINKING.

375
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,317
OH, I KNOW, HE'S GONNA
LOOK IN THE MIRROR. 

376
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,985
OH, YEAH.
LOOK IN THE MIRROR.

377
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,286
OVER THE SHOULDER.
MY GOSH.

378
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,688
THIS SHOULD BE GOOD.
THIS SHOULD BE GOOD.

379
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,123
AND... BEAUTIFUL!
BEAUTIFUL.

380
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,459
RIGHT THROUGH.
THERE'S FOUR POINTS.

381
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,528
SO THAT'S A CHALLENGE TO -- 

382
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:03,462
ALL RIGHT, WE DON'T
NEED THAT.

383
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,396
WE DON'T NEED
THAT ATTITUDE.

384
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,198
NOW A CHALLENGE TO WALTER

385
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,733
SO HE TAKES THE CHALLENGE
AND RUNS WITH IT.

386
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,601
HE TAKES THE ROPE
RIGHT OFF THERE.

387
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:10,602
AND HE'S GONNA USE
THE MIRROR.

388
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:11,403
NO, HE'S NOT.

389
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,439
OH, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, WALTER.

390
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,375
TOTALLY WITHOUT LOOKING,

391
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,877
AND SHE'S IN!
WE GOT A FOUR-POINT TIE.

392
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:23,449
ALRIGHT. NOW WE MOVE ON TO
THE LAY-UP SECTION.

393
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,950
AND -- SLAM DUNK
LOOK AT THIS  AND HE'S UP

394
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,353
AND -- BOY, BEAUTIFUL.
BEAUTIFUL.

395
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,755
BOY, HE'S GOT GREAT --
WELL, HE TAKES THE
NET WITH HIM.

396
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:31,957
IT'LL BE TOUGH FOR
MIKE TO TOP THIS ONE,

397
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,759
BUT HE'S GOT A PLAN.

398
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,760
HE GOES DOWN
TO THE BOAT HOUSE

399
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,495
AND GETS ONE OF THE
CANOE PADDLES.

400
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,497
HE'S GOT AN OLD
BUNGEE ON THERE,

401
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,066
AND HE TIES THE TETHER BALL
ONTO THE BUNGEE CORD.

402
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,634
DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S
GOT IN MIND THERE. 

403
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,336
AND HE GOES DOWN
OVER THE BACK AND --

404
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,571
OH, IT'S A PADDLE BALL!

405
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,272
AND HE'S RACKING 'EM UP!

406
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:49,875
OH, MY GOSH! 

407
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,411
IT'S ALL OVER, FOLKS.

408
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:57,282
[applause] 

409
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,389
THIS IS THE PART OF THE SHOW
WHERE WE FEATURE

410
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:06,458
THOSE THREE LITTLE WORDS
MEN FIND SO HARD TO SAY...

411
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:09,395
audience: I DON'T KNOW! 

412
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,930
AND TODAY'S LETTER
READS AS FOLLOWS...

413
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,433
"DEAR EXPERTS, I PRIDE
MYSELF IN KEEPING UP"

414
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:18,370
"WITH CURRENT TRENDS AND FADS,
NO MATTER HOW FLEETING
THEY MIGHT BE"

415
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,106
"RECENTLY I READ IN THE PAPER
ABOUT SOMETHING CALLED"

416
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,441
"THE INTERNET"

417
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,776
"WHAT'S THAT?"

418
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:25,878
WHAT'S THE INTERNET? 

419
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,447
BOY, THAT MUST'VE BEEN
SOME KIND OF COMA, HUH?

420
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,618
YEAH. ALL RIGHT, WELL,
THE INTERNET IS SOMETHING

421
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:33,819
THAT CONNECTS TO
YOUR COMPUTER

422
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,821
SO THAT YOU CAN CONTACT
EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD

423
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,656
WHO WANTS TO SELL
YOU SOMETHING.

424
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,060
NO, THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY
TRUE, UNCLE RED.

425
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,662
NO, THE INTERNET IS PROBABLY
THE MOST IMPORTANT INNOVATION

426
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:46,799
FOR COMMUNICATION, EDUCATION,
SINCE THE MOVABLE TYPE.

427
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,668
I SPEND HOURS ON
THE INTERNET.

428
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,603
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU
HAD A COMPUTER, DALTON.

429
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:52,604
OH, GOSH, YES.

430
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:56,241
I JUST FIND THERE IS SO MUCH
FASCINATING INFORMATION
ON THE INTERNET.

431
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,643
ABSOLUTELY, YES.

432
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:00,612
THE UNFORTUNATE ASPECT IS HOW
MUCH PORNOGRAPHY'S ON THERE.

433
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,048
WELL, YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE,
THAT'S ALL THEY USE IT FOR.

434
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:12,424
[laughter]

435
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,660
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKIN' AT ME FOR? 

436
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,229
I DON'T DO ANY OF THAT.

437
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,431
WELL, AT LEAST,
NOT INTENTIONALLY.

438
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,600
NOT VERY OFTEN. 

439
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,635
LOOK, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

440
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,004
ANN MARIE WANTED TO
RE-MODEL THE KITCHEN, RIGHT?

441
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,040
SO I DID A SEARCH FOR
"PANTRIES."

442
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,408
BUT THERE WAS A TYPO.

443
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,610
[laughter]

444
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,312
THAT'S NOT WHAT THE
INTERNET'S FOR,
MR. DALTON.

445
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,080
LOOK, IT WAS AN
ACCIDENT, ALL RIGHT?

446
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,916
AND BESIDES, IT'S PRIVATE.
WHO'S GONNA KNOW?

447
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,986
WELL, ANYBODY WHO HAS
ACCESS TO THE COMPUTER.

448
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,490
STORED SOMEWHERE IN YOUR
COMPUTER IS EVERY WEBSITE
YOU'VE EVER VISITED.

449
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:47,226
EVERY ONE?

450
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:48,660
Harold: EVERY ONE. 

451
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:51,363
HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD
A COMPUTER, DALTON?

452
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,332
UM, I-IT'S ANN MARIE'S.

453
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,269
I GOTTA GO!

454
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:02,741
YOU BETTER CALL ROTHSCHILD'S
SEWAGE TODAY, 

455
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,144
'CAUSE THAT SOGGY MESS
IS HERE TO STAY.

456
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:07,779
WHATEVER GOES UP
COMES DOWN, THEY SAY.

457
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,916
BUT WHATEVER GOES DOWN,
DOESN'T ALWAYS GO AWAY.

458
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,920
[applause]

459
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:21,026
OKAY, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT
IF ANY OF YOU EVER GO
TO A PROTEST

460
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,695
THAT YOU FIND OUT WHAT
THE PROTEST IS ABOUT

461
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:25,297
BEFORE YOU GET THERE.

462
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,699
IT WAS ABOUT THE
RIGHT TO ADOPT A CHILD.

463
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,801
YEAH, OKAY, AND
I WAS FINE WITH THAT.

464
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:32,204
I JUST WAS A LITTLE
SURPRISED WHEN I REALISED

465
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,173
THAT WASN'T THE MAIN AGENDA.

466
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,419
WELL, THAT OUGHTA
KEEP HIM OUTTA MY TENT.

467
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,023
YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL
JUST PEOPLE, RED.

468
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,125
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT IT
WAS GOOD TO SHOW OUR
SOLIDARITY.

469
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,493
YEAH, I KNOW. I WAS FINE
WITH THAT.

470
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,695
BUT DID YOU
HAVE TO PUT YOUR
ARM AROUND ME, WINSTON?

471
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,330
RED, I WAS UPSET.

472
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,799
IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THEY
WEREN'T GONNA LET ME ADOPT.

473
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,668
THEY WERE DISCRIMINATING

474
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,369
AGAINST MY
ENTREPRENEURIAL LIFESTYLE.

475
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,437
NO, THEY WERE NOT.

476
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:06,805
THEY WERE PROTECTING
AN INNOCENT CHILD.

477
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,208
THEY WANTED THE CHILD TO BE
RAISED IN A LOVING ATMOSPHERE.

478
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,710
YOU LOVE YOUR JOB.
AND YOUR ATMOSPHERE
IS TOXIC.

479
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,446
WELL, NOW WHAT AM
I GONNA DO

480
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:17,015
WITH THE FAMILY BUSINESS
AND NO CHILD TO TAKE IT ON?

481
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,518
I MEAN, SEPTIC SUCKING
IS NOT SOMETHING

482
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,053
YOU JUST FALL INTO, RED.

483
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,522
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

484
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:24,990
IF YOU WANNA
IMMORTALIZE YOURSELF,

485
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,893
WHY DON'T YOU ADD YOUR FACE TO
THE LOGO OF THE COMPANY?

486
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,361
YOU KNOW, LIKE
COLONEL SANDERS.

487
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,164
YOU COULD BECOME THE
COLONEL SANDERS OF
SEPTIC SUCKING.

488
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:33,999
THAT'S A PRETTY
GOOD IDEA, RED.

489
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,468
OH, YEAH. EVERY TIME PEOPLE
SAW YOUR FACE,

490
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,170
THEY'D THINK OF SEWAGE.

491
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,207
[possum squealing]

492
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:42,941
MEETING TIME.

493
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:44,843
YOU GO AHEAD.
I'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE. ALL RIGHT?

494
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:46,745
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

495
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,680
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT
HOME AFTER THE MEETING.

496
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,748
LET ME RE-PHRASE THAT.

497
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,484
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT
AFTER THE MEETING.

498
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,820
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

499
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,656
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND THE
WHOLE GANG AT POSSUM LODGE,

500
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,924
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

501
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:09,468
[applause]

502
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,203
[possum squealing]

503
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:13,572
EVERYBODY SIT DOWN.

504
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:14,106
SIT DOWN.

505
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:14,973
EVERYBODY SIT DOWN.

506
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:17,943
EVERYBODY SIT.

507
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,145
ALL RISE!

508
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,751
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI.

509
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,286
Red: SIT DOWN.

510
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,588
BOW YOUR HEADS
FOR THE MEN'S PRAYER.

511
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:33,125
I'M A MAN, BUT I CAN CHANGE,

512
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,094
IF I HAVE TO, I GUESS.

513
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,766
THESE FLOWERS
CAME FOR YOU, MR. GREEN.

514
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:43,335
THEY'RE FROM
AN ADMIRER.

515
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,506
THANKS, DOUG.
