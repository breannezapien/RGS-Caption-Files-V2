00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:05,438
GUYS AREN'T REALLY GOOD AT
DOING TWO THINGS AT ONCE.

2
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:08,375
THAT'S WHY YOU'LL NEVER SEE US
SIMULTANEOUSLY HAVE DINNER

3
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,777
AND MAKE CONVERSATION,

4
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:12,679
OR DRIVE AND
LOOK AT A MAP,

5
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,482
OR GO SHOPPING AND SMILE.

6
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:17,450
WHEN WE SIT DOWN
IN OUR FAVOURITE CHAIR,

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,419
WE'RE THERE FOR
ONE OF TWO REASONS...

8
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:22,255
EITHER TO READ THE PAPER
OR TO WATCH TELEVISION.

9
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:25,425
THE PROBLEM IS THESE
DAYS THE GENIUSES WHO
BROADCAST THE SHOWS

10
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,260
ARE ALWAYS FILLING UP
THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN

11
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,395
WITH WORDS TO DISTRACT US.

12
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:32,165
LIKE WEATHER WARNINGS
AND URGENT NEWS UPDATES

13
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,501
AND OTHER STUFF THAT HAS
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO

14

WITH GILLIGAN'S CHANCES OF
GETTING OFF THE ISLAND.

15

SO HERE'S WHAT YOU DO...

THESE OLD, TOP LOADING VCRs

AND THEN DUCT TAPE A METAL
RULER ONTO THE TAPE
LOADING MECHANISM.

18
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:50,483
NOW THE NEXT TIME MY FAVOURITE

BY REALITY,

00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,519
I JUST HIT THE
EJECT BUTTON,

I CAN DRILL HOLES IN THE WALL

OUT OF MY RECLINER.

THE LODGE IS OUT OF PLUM.

THINK YOU REALLY --

YOU GOTTA DO
SOMETHING, THOUGH,

BEFORE IT TURNS
INTO A SERIOUS PROBLEM.

OF THE WAY YOU'RE

YOUR WORK IS DONE.

WELL, THIS FELLA'S BOY
SOUNDS A BIT LIKE

HE DON'T HAVE WHAT THEY
CALL YOUR WORK "ETHNIC."

HE DON'T DO ENOUGH
TO BE LAZY.

HE'S MORE IN THE
COMATOSE CATEGORY.

YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

I THINK PARENTS GOTTA
LEARN TO BE MORE PATIENT,

113
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,921
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE SOMETIMES
IT TAKES A WHILE

FOR A CHILD
TO FIND HIMSELF.

ORVILLE'S NOT EVEN
LOOKIN' FOR IT.

116
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:31,196
WELL, TO ME, IT STARTS
WITH GETTING A JOB,

117
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:32,865
BECAUSE ONCE YOU
MAKE AN INCOME,

118
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,533
THE GUY CAN START
TO FIND HIS OWN WAY.

119
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:36,101
THAT'S KINDA WHAT I DID.

120
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:37,503
REALLY?

121
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,004
WHAT JOB WAS THAT?

122
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:41,473
I DON'T REMEMBER
YOU EVER HAVING A JOB.

123
00:05:41,473 --> 00:05:44,143
WELL, I MARRIED
BERNICE, HAROLD.

124
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:48,313
THAT'S A VOCATION
WITH NO VACATION.

125
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:51,717
WELL, I WOULDN'T MIND
SO MUCH IF THE
YOUNG PEOPLE

126
00:05:51,717 --> 00:05:53,519
WOULD AT LEAST HELP
OUT A LITTLE BIT

127
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,020
AFTER THEY MOVE
BACK HOME.

128
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,289
I MEAN REAL HELP,
NOT WHAT ORVILLE DOES,

129
00:05:57,289 --> 00:05:59,691
SITTIN' AROUND ALL DAY
IN HIS UNDERWEAR,

130
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:04,096
SAYING THAT'S HIS WAY OF
CUTTING DOWN ON THE LAUNDRY.

131
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:09,067
VALEDA'S CHURCH GROUP
FINDS IT TERRIBLY DISTRACTING.

132
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:12,471
AND IT CAN'T BE GOOD
FOR THE HOUSE PLANTS.

133
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:13,972
OH! OH!
I HAVE AN IDEA!

134
00:06:13,972 --> 00:06:15,607
WHY NOT SEND HIM
HERE TO THE LODGE?

135
00:06:15,607 --> 00:06:17,509
YEAH. BECAUSE THERE'S
ALWAYS THINGS AROUND HERE

136
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:19,845
THAT NEED FIXING
AND APOLOGIZING FOR.

137
00:06:19,845 --> 00:06:22,314
OKAY, CHARLIE, I THINK
WHAT HAROLD MEANS IS

138
00:06:22,314 --> 00:06:24,283
THAT IF ORVILLE COMES
HERE TO THE LODGE,

139
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,618
THEN HAROLD WOULD
GO AND STAY WITH YOU.

140
00:06:26,618 --> 00:06:29,788
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE
EXPRESSION FAIR EXCHANGE?

141
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:31,523
ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH THE EXPRESSION,

142
00:06:31,523 --> 00:06:34,927
NOT A SNOWBALL'S
CHANCE IN HELL?

143
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:36,828
WELL, SEE,
THERE'S YOUR ANSWER.

144
00:06:36,828 --> 00:06:38,597
MAKE THE BEST OF
THE ORVILLE YOU HAVE,

145
00:06:38,597 --> 00:06:41,733
BECAUSE THERE COULD BE A
HAROLD RIGHT AROUND
THE CORNER.

146
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:50,275
YOU KNOW, MARRIAGE
IS A COMPROMISE.

147
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:53,278
IF YOU'RE MARRIED,
YOU'RE COMPROMISED.

148
00:06:53,278 --> 00:06:54,813
SO YOU END UP MAKING DEALS.

149
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:56,248
YOU KNOW, TRADE-OFFS.

150
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:58,617
LIKE IN MY CASE, FOR EVERY
TEN VEHICLES I BRING HOME,

151
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:01,720
MY WIFE IS ALLOWED
TO RENOVATE THE KITCHEN.

152
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,523
ON THE PLUS SIDE, BERNICE SAYS
I CAN USE ALL THIS OLD STUFF

153
00:07:04,523 --> 00:07:06,258
TO BUILD ANYTHING I WANT,

154
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:08,660
AS LONG AS YOU CAN'T
SEE IT FROM THE STREET.

155
00:07:10,295 --> 00:07:13,465
SO I'M THINKIN' IF I COULD USE
THE DISCARDED APPLIANCES
AND WHAT HAVE YOU

156
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:17,202
TO CUSTOMIZE ONE OF THE
VEHICLES THAT CAUSED THE
PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE,

157
00:07:17,202 --> 00:07:20,772
HEY, THAT'S THE CLOSEST A GUY
LIKE ME EVER GETS TO WINNING.

158
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:23,575
AND THE BEST PART ABOUT
RENOVATING YOUR VEHICLE
WITH KITCHEN FIXTURES

159
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:26,545
IS YOU'RE ONLY LIMITED
BY YOUR OWN IMAGINATION.

160
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:46,164
[ SNORING ]

161
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:53,839
OKAY, LET'S SAY YOU NEED TO
REPLACE THE OLD HOOD ORNAMENT

162
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:56,942
BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL ONE WAS
STOLEN, OR MAYBE IT BROKE OFF.

163
00:07:56,942 --> 00:07:59,744
MAYBE WHEN YOU WENT FOR
SUPPER AT BOZO'S FAST
FOOD DRIVE-THRU

164
00:07:59,744 --> 00:08:03,682
AND YOU CAUGHT THE HOOD
ORNAMENT IN ONE OF THE
CLOWN'S NOSTRILS.

165
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:05,650
WHO HASN'T DONE THAT?

166
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,053
OKAY, SO IF YOU'RE
A BUICK MAN,

167
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:09,888
YOU MIGHT WANNA GO WITH
SOMETHING TALL AND THIN,

168
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:11,857
LIKE THIS MEAT THERMOMETER.

169
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:15,260
PERSONALLY, I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED TO DRIVE A JAG.

170
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,163
SO I STUCK THE OLD KITCHEN
FAUCET ON THERE,

171
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:20,098
BECAUSE IF I EVER
DO BUY A JAG,

172
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:21,900
I'LL BE TAPPED OUT.

173
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,603
OF COURSE, NOW,
THE FAUCET DOESN'T RUN.

174
00:08:24,603 --> 00:08:27,239
BUT HEY, IT'S A JAGUAR.

175
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:29,407
NEXT I WANNA JAZZ UP
MY OLD RIMS

SOMETHING UNIQUE.

178
00:08:36,214 --> 00:08:39,384
THE ONLY WAY THIS
BABY'LL EVER BURN RUBBER.

179
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:42,254
NOW, AT THE BACK OF THE CAR
YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE
OF OPTIONS.

180
00:08:42,254 --> 00:08:44,556
IF YOU'RE A YOUNG, RICH KID,
YOU'RE PROBABLY SPOILED.

WANNA HAVE A SPOILER.

HOW ABOUT THE
OVEN HOOD, HUH?

183
00:08:49,628 --> 00:08:51,763
THE BEAUTY THERE IS,
IF YOUR CAR BURNS OIL,

184
00:08:51,763 --> 00:08:54,733
YOU CAN ALWAYS TURN ON
THE EXHAUST FAN.

OR MAYBE YOU'RE INTO THE
WHOLE RETRO NOSTALGIA CRAZE.

186
00:08:58,036 --> 00:09:00,972
WELL, THEN MAYBE YOU
NEED A RUMBLE SEAT.

187
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:06,478

TEST THESE FIRST

188
00:09:06,478 --> 00:09:08,313

TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T
FALL OFF AT HIGH SPEED.

191
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:15,320
I'VE GONE AHEAD
AND REPLACED

192
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,888
THE DOOR THAT STICKS
ON MY GLOVE COMPARTMENT.

193
00:09:16,888 --> 00:09:18,790
IN FACT I REPLACED
THE WHOLE COMPARTMENT

00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,126
WITH THIS EASY
TO OPEN BREAD BOX.

195
00:09:21,126 --> 00:09:23,695
I'VE ALSO EXPANDED MY CAR'S
BEVERAGE HOLDING CAPACITY

00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:26,231
WITH THIS TRAY
FROM MY DISHWASHER.

GET IN YOUR CUP HOLDER?

AND THAT'S NOT A EUPHEMISM.

199

OH, AND ONE MORE THING...

YOU GET PULLED OVER,

201

AND YOU WILL
GET PULLED OVER,

202

NO MORE FUMBLING
AROUND IN YOUR WALLET

FOR YOU LICENSE
AND REGISTRATION.

204

DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

OF ATTENTION ANYMORE,

AROUND US,

WE BOOMED.

222
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:48,846
AND IT'S A TOUGH ADJUSTMENT
WHEN THE ADVERTISERS

223
