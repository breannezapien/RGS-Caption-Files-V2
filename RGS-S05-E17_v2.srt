IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

3
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:13,046
IF YOU GO OUT
IN THE WOODS TODAY 

4
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:15,081
YOU'RE IN
FOR A BIG SURPRISE 

5
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:18,184
HERE'S THE MAN WHO TURNED
THAT SONG INTO A WARNING,

6
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:22,389
MY UNCLE, YOUR HOST, RED GREEN!

9
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:27,994
THANK YOU.

10
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,362
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

11
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,965
APPRECIATE YOUR COMING HERE.

12
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,933
HAD A LITTLE ACCIDENT

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,369
UP AT THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

14
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:39,539
JUNIOR SINGLETON BLEW THE ROOF

15
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:41,708
RIGHT OFF HIS GARAGE.

16
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,010
YEAH, BUT HE LEARNED SOMETHING.

17
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,279
YOU NEVER JUMP-START
A BARBECUE.

18
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,348
AND LUCKILY, YOU KNOW,

19
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:50,483
THE ROOF LANDED
COMPLETELY INTACT --

20
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,952
UPSIDE DOWN, OF COURSE --
IN POSSUM LAKE.

21
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,888
HERE'S THE KICKER --
SHE FLOATS.

22
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:56,389
SO GET THIS, RIGHT?

23
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:59,726
BECAUSE THE ROOF IS THE ONLY
THING THE LODGE MEMBERS HAVE

24
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,028
THAT DOESN'T LEAK,
INCLUDING THEMSELVES,

25
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,830
THEY'RE TURNING IT
INTO A BOAT.

26
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,698
NOT JUST ANY BOAT --
A FAN-BOAT.

27
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:08,334
WE'VE MOUNTED A DODGE
SLANT-SIX ON THE BACK.

28
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,537
GOT A HELICOPTER ROTOR ON
VERTICALLY.

29
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:13,973
PUT THE UNIT IN WHERE THE
EAVESTROUGH JOINS THE SOFFIT --

30
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,575
WHERE THE BIRD'S NEST WAS.

31
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,844
WE'RE GONNA TRY IT NOW,
SO STAY TUNED.

32
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,712
YOU CAN WATCH IT ON TELEVISION

33
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:22,916
OR GO TO OUR HOSPITAL
AND MEET THE GUYS IN AN HOUR.

[Red]: TODAY'S SHOW'S
ABOUT INSECTS.

38
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,036
I'LL MAKE A BUG REPELLER.

39
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,537
RANGER GORD

40
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,040
IS GONNA BE TAGGING HOUSEFLIES.

41
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,908
HAROLD'S GONNA BE BUGGING

42
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:51,044
EVERYBODY, INCLUDING DOUGIE,

43
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,378
AND I'LL SHOW YOU HOW

44
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,280
TO DEAL WITH INSECTICIDE.

45
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,620
YOU HEARD OF MURPHY'S LAW?

46
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:03,490
THIS PLACE SHOULD BE CALLED
MURPHY'S LODGE.

47
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:06,893
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY
FOR THAT STATUE, YOU KNOW.

48
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,394
OH, HAROLD.

49
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,564
THEY GO TO START THAT MOTOR
ON THE HELICOPTER THING,

50
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,766
BUT THE FAN-BOAT
DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE,

51
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,568
'CAUSE IT NEVER WAS FLOATING.

52
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,270
IT WAS WEDGED ON A SANDBAR!

53
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:18,571
HAROLD, HAROLD.

54
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,473
I'LL TELL THE STORY.

55
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,042
MOOSE THOMPSON FIGURES
IT NEEDS MORE GAS,

56
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,878
SO HE GIVES IT MORE THROTTLE

57
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,379
AND MORE THROTTLE...

58
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:27,914
AND... MORE THROTTLE.

59
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,682
THAT'S CLEVER, ISN'T IT?

60
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,918
IF SOMETHING'S GONNA GO WRONG,

61
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,888
LET'S HAVE IT HAPPEN
AT MAXIMUM VELOCITY.

62
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:37,891
EXACTLY -- THE FAN-BOAT
STILL DOESN'T MOVE.

63
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:41,060
THE BACKWASH FROM THE PROP
WHIPS ACROSS TOWN,

64
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:44,330
LIFTS THE BILLBOARD
RIGHT OFF THE MAIN HIGHWAY.

65
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,566
THIS PICTURE OF A SMILING COW
ON A UNICYCLE

66
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,434
IS FLYING THROUGH THE SKY.

67
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,336
THAT'S NOT GONNA SELL
MUCH MILK.

68
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:51,671
NO.

69
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,607
SUDDENLY, BOOM! LANDS
IN THE CENTRE OF TOWN.

70
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,843
FLATTENED THE STATUE
OF SOME GUY.

71
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,344
THAT'S NOT "SOME GUY".

72
00:02:58,411 --> 00:02:59,846
THAT'S EZRA BANGER.

73
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,482
HE'S THE FIRST CITIZEN
IN POSSUM LAKE

74
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,584
TO WANGLE A GOVERNMENT GRANT.

75
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,754
HE GOT $35 TO KILL MOSQUITOES
WITH A HAMMER.

76
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,088
YEAH, BUT YOU SAID

77
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:11,024
THE FAN-BOAT WOULD WORK
AND IT DIDN'T, SO

78
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,760
YOU MADE A MISTAKE 

79
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,528
YOU MADE A MISTAKE 

80
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,397
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

81
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,399
YOU DID SOMETHING STUPID.

82
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:20,867
NOW YOU GOTTA PAY.

83
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,802
YOU MADE A MISTAKE 

84
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,238
ALL RIGHT, FINE, I ADMIT IT.

85
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:28,875
I MADE A MISTAKE,
BUT SO DID YOUR PARENTS.

86
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,610
YOU MADE
A MISTAKE 

87
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,378
YOU MADE
A MISTAKE 

88
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:33,947
HAROLD, I'M ARMED.

89
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:39,485
[Red]: BILL ASKED ME
TO GIVE HIM A HAND

90
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,454
GETTING THIS CAR GOING.

91
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:44,824
FIRST PROBLEM IS
HE'S LOCKED HIMSELF OUT.

92
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,292
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

93
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,194
OH, HE'S GOT A COAT HANGER.

94
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:51,097
JUST HAVING COME OUT
OF A CLOSET RECENTLY,

95
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,900
HE'S STILL GOT THE HANGER
IN HIS SWEATER.

96
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,102
I NOTICE THAT
THE PASSENGER DOOR

97
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,404
IS, UH... THAT, TO ME,
SEEMED EASIER.

98
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,974
WHY DON'T WE GET IN THERE
AND SLIDE OVER?

99
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,909
YOU DON'T NEED THE COAT HANGER.

100
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,410
BILL? BILL? BILL?

101
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:05,912
HEY, BILL!

102
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,414

103
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,350

STOP! I'M-- BILL!

I'M IN THE-- BILL, I'M IN--

106
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,956
COME HERE -- I WANT
TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

107
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,491
HEY, LOOK AT THIS, BILL.

108
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,526
THE DOOR'S
ACTUALLY OPEN -- LOOK.

109
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,861
OHHHHH!

110
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,863
SEE? GOT HER
COMPLETELY UNLOCKED.

111
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,498
COME HERE A MINUTE.

112
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,367
YOU'LL SEE -- TAKE A LOOK.

113
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,369
SEE? OH!

114
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,071
WE'LL GET IT STARTED LATER ON.

THIS IS THE BIG ONE.

TO GET DOUGIE FRANKLIN
TO SAY THIS WORD.

WOULD BE...

YES, BUT YOU'D BE DISQUALIFIED
BECAUSE YOU...

130
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:11,811
... GOT CAUGHT.

131
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,313

Y-Y-YOU DEBUNK SOMEBODY,
YOU STACK THE DECK,

Y-Y-YOU, UH...
Y-Y-YOU... FRAUD,

UH, THAT'S...
THAT'S...

OHHHH!

138
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,725
BUT IF SOMEBODY DOES THAT

139
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,627
TO YOU...
THEY'RE A
DIRTY CHEAT.

THERE'S A LESSON
TO BE LEARNED HERE 

148
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,849
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO TAKE DOWN A NOTE 

149
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,352
YOU CAN HAVE EXTRA HELPINGS
OR BEND OVER 

150
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:56,255
BUT YOU OBVIOUSLY
CAN'T DO BOTH 

151
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,790
YOU KNOW, HEARING HOW

152
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,125
EZRA BANGER GOT HIMSELF

153
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,560
HIS OWN STATUE

JUST FOR KILLING MOSQUITOES

155
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,064
HAS ME THINKING
THAT IF A PERSON FOUND

156
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,833
A BETTER WAY TO KILL BUGS,

157
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:10,269
THEY COULD NOT ONLY GET RICH,
THEY'D GET MORE DATES.

158
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:13,840
I THOUGHT I'D TAKE THIS WEEK'S
"HANDYMAN CORNER"...

159
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:16,976
SHOW YOU HOW YOU CAN TELL
THE INSECTS TO BUG OFF.

160
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,213
ALL RIGHT, THIS THING IS CALLED
A FOGGING MACHINE.

161
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,848
HOPE THAT CAME OUT RIGHT.

THE WAY THAT WORKS IS
YOU FILL HER FULL OF PESTICIDE

163
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:27,720
AND THEN YOU BLAST OUT
THIS TOXIC CRAP,

164
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:30,156
KILLING ALL THE MOSQUITOES.

165
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,259
IF YOU KILL ALL THE MOSQUITOES
IN YOUR AREA,

166
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:36,562
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE OUT
EVERY OTHER FORM OF LIFE.

167
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,899
INSTEAD OF THAT, I SAY
WE JUST... [coughing]...

168
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:43,169
WE CONCENTRATE ON MOSQUITOES
FLYING IN YOUR FACE

169
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,839
AND BITING YOU WHERE
YOU THOUGHT NOTHING EVER WOULD.

170
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:50,243
GET YOURSELF ONE OF THESE
ALUMINUM LAWN CHAIRS

171
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,912
AND AN ELECTRIC DRILL
AND GET BUSY.

172
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,195
THERE WE GO.

173
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,998
I CAN GO OUT
IN THE WORST MOSQUITO WEATHER.

174
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,366
I JUST SIT DOWN,

175
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,336
GET COMFORTABLE, TURN ON
MY MOSQUITO FOGGER, WHICH IS

176
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:20,440
HOOKED UP TO THE CHAIR
AND RUNS THROUGH THE HOLES.

177
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:23,476
GIVE HER A COUPLE OF SECONDS
TO KIND OF WARM UP.

178
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,879
SOON, THAT INSECTICIDE FOG
IS GONNA...

179
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,381
[coughing]

180
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,283
THE BEAUTY OF THIS SYSTEM IS

181
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:33,352
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT
ANY INSECT REPELLANT ON.

182
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:37,056
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT TAKING TOXIC CHEMICALS...

183
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,391
[coughing]

184
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,393
... IN THROUGH YOUR SKIN.

185
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,128
[coughing]

186
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,401
OH... UH, YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

187
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,839
UH, THOSE WHO ARE ALLERGIC
TO THE RAGWEED OR THE POLLEN

188
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:55,775
OR THE [coughing] D.D.--
[coughing] OR THE D.D.--

189
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,343
[coughing] OR THE D.D.T.,

190
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,545
YOU MIGHT WANT
A MECHANICAL SOLUTION.

191
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,715
YOU KNOW HOW THE HORSE HAS
A TAIL AND THEY FLIP THAT

192
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,183
AND IT PUSHES BUGS AWAY?

193
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,986
IN AUSTRALIA, THEY GOT HATS
WITH CORKS ON 'EM.

194
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,388
THEY FLIP THEM AROUND
TO KEEP DIDJERIDUS

195
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,491
AND WALLABIES
OFF THEIR BILLABONGS.

196
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,025
YOU CAN DO THE SAME THING

197
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,328
BY TAKING ONE
OF THESE PATIO UMBRELLAS

198
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:17,230
AND A WASHING MACHINE.

199
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:21,200
ALL YOU DO IS HANG
YOUR VARIOUS LITTLE TRINKETS

200
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:24,871
ON THE EDGE OF THE UMBRELLA
AND THEN HOOK HER UP.

201
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,373
[Music mimicking
a ticking clock]

202
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:38,951
[grunting]

203
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,232
ALL RIGHT, THERE WE GO.

204
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,868
I GOT MY DOODADS DUCT-TAPED
TO THE UMBRELLA.

205
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:59,038
I GOT THE UMBRELLA DUCT-TAPED
TO THE WASHING MACHINE.

206
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,407
SHE'S ALL SET --
LET'S GIVE HER A TRY.

207
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,011
WELL, THERE IT IS.

208
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:08,347
PEOPLE WILL BE TALKING
ABOUT YOU ALL OVER TOWN.

209
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:12,351
THEY'LL SAY, "IT'S JUST LIKE
A FLICKING HORSE'S BEHIND!"

210
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,120
OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT.

211
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:16,789
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

212
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,824
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

213
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,927
UH-OH, SPIN CYCLE!

214
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,304
BILL IS ALL CRANKED UP
AND NOWHERE TO GO.

215
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,443
THE TOWN COUNCIL WILL REPLACE

216
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,079
THE STATUE WE DESTROYED
WITH OUR FAN-BOAT.

217
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:41,881
WE'RE IN THE WRONG BUSINESS.

218
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:45,051
SCULPTORS ARE GETTING THOUSANDS
FOR DOING NOTHING.

219
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:46,385
NOTHING?!

220
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,087
IT TAKES A LOT OF TALENT

221
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,957
TO TURN A HUNK OF ROCK
INTO A HUMAN FACE.

222
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,025
MOTHER NATURE DID IT WITH YOU.

223
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,327
[audience laughing]

224
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,228
... OR CLOSE
ENOUGH.

225
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,531
WE DON'T NEED
ANY STARVING ARTIST

226
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,466
TRYING TO RIP EVERYBODY OFF

227
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,269
WHILE THEY WAIT
FOR ANOTHER RENAISSANCE.

228
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,871
WE'RE GONNA BUILD
A STATUE OURSELVES.

229
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,608
I COULD BUILD A SCULPTURE
PRETTY CHEAP.

230
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:12,912
IN CUBS, I'D MAKE ASHTRAYS OUT
OF ASBESTOS FOR FATHER'S DAY.

231
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,314
THE LEADERS FIGURED
IF THEY SMOKE,

232
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,617
ASBESTOS WON'T BE HURTING THEM.

233
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,987
THANKS ANYWAY, HAROLD,
BUT WE'VE ALREADY DECIDED.

234
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:22,421
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

235
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,357
HUH? SEE THAT, EH?

236
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,325
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A GIANT POSSUM

237
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:29,128
IN FRONT OF THE MAYOR'S OFFICE,
LOOKING DEAD.

238
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,997
TALK ABOUT LIFE IMITATES ART.

239
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:32,498
OH, YEAH, I'M SURE.

240
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,401
YOU GUYS THINK YOU CAN DO
EVERYTHING UNTIL YOU TRY IT.

241
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,070
YOU THINK YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING
AND YOU PROVE IT.

242
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,572
THAT'S RIGHT--

243
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,173
[applause]

244
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,077
OK, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TODAY,
RANGER GORD?

245
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,948
WELL, TODAY, RED, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN, I'M PERFORMING

246
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:52,118
ONE OF MY MOST FAVOURITE TASKS
AS A RANGER --

247
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,486
TAGGING WILDLIFE.

248
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:57,123
SOMETIMES I'LL BE TAGGING MOOSE
OR BEAR, BUT TODAY,

249
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:00,593
I'M DOING THE TRICKIEST
OF ALL -- I'M TAGGING FLIES.

250
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,629
THE FIRST THING WE DO
IS LURE THEM CLOSE.

251
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:06,599
IT'S A SHAME
STINKY PETERSON ISN'T HERE.

252
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,602
I HAVE THIS GREEN PORK CHOP.

253
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,936
[fly buzzing]

254
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,271
OH, THERE WE GO!

255
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,606
[buzzing]

256
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,940
GOT HIM!

257
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,275
NICE WORK!

258
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,610
NO, IT'S A HER.

259
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,111
OH, BOY!

260
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,981
I'M GOING TO BE TAKING
ONE OF THESE TAGS.

261
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:25,051
IF YOU'D TAKE DOWN THE DETAILS,
PLEASE, RED?

262
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:26,619
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

263
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,555
FIRE AWAY.

264
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:34,593
NOW, IT IS A FEMALE BLACKFLY,
TAG NUMBER 22395...

265
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,928
22395...

266
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,430
NO DISCERNIBLE MARKINGS.

267
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:38,931
I GOT IT.

268
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,267
TO MAKE SURE THE TAG STAYS ON,

269
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,069
WE'LL USE THIS STAPLER.

270
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,071
OH, OH, OH!

271
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:46,572
OH, NO.

272
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,074
IT'S ON THERE.

273
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,142
I KILLED IT, RED.

274
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,579
I KILLED
ONE OF NATURE'S WONDERS.

275
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,081
NO, NO, COME ON...

276
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,582
NO, NO, NO.

277
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,251
NO, SHE'S FINE, GORD --
FLEW AWAY.

278
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:00,753
FLYING RIGHT AS RAIN.

279
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,088
SHE FLEW AWAY?

280
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:05,591
YEAH, JUST HAD TO GET USED
TO THE TAG'S WEIGHT.

281
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:06,926
OH! OK, GREAT.

282
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:09,462
WELL, LET'S DO
NUMBER 22396, HUH?

283
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:12,598
FOR DINNER, I'LL FRY US
SOME PORK CHOPS.

284
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,100
[Fly buzzing]

285
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,168
OK.

286
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:20,106
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS A WOOD FILE
CALLED A COARSE BASTARD FILE.

287
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,308
THAT'S RIGHT, A COARSE BASTARD.

288
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:25,044
IT SAYS RIGHT THERE --
"COARSE BASTARD",

289
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,213
SO STINKY, IF YOU'RE WATCHING,

290
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,448
IT'S YOU WHO OWES ME
AN APOLOGY.

291
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:33,352
I DON'T MIND PEOPLE OFFERING
OPINIONS ON OUR SCULPTURE,

292
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,556
BUT I DON'T NEED PUNKS PLAYING
STREET-BALL NEAR THE STATUE.

293
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:40,493
THAT WAS THE POSSUM LAKE
HIGH SCHOOL TEAM.

294
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,228
THEY HAD A BAD ATTITUDE.

295
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,729
NO, THEY
DIDN'T.

296
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,297
I KNOW THOSE GIRLS.

297
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,133
[audience laughing]

298
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,101
THEY'RE IN MY
HOME EC. CLASS.

299
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:53,038
I DON'T KNOW WHY PEOPLE FEEL
THEY GOTTA OFFER SUGGESTIONS,

300
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,441
YELLING WHILE
WE'RE TRYING TO CARVE.

301
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:58,077
THEY'RE SAYING,
"TAKE A BIT OFF THERE!"

302
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,079
OR "PUT A BIT BACK ON THERE!"

303
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,580
OR... "WHOOPS!

304
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:04,784
OLD MAN SEDGWICK'S
STANDING BACK, SAYING,

305
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,319
"THAT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE A DUCK."

306
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:10,956
YOU GET 30 MEN WALING AWAY
ON A BIG PIECE OF ROCK

307
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,559
WITH SLEDGE-HAMMERS
AND TIRE IRONS,

308
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,695
YOU'RE ASKING FOR TROUBLE,
BUT YOU KNOW, I'M BEING HONEST.

309
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,030
LOTS OF THOSE PEOPLE,

310
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,032
THEY'RE GIVING
CREATIVE SUGGESTIONS.

311
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:23,469
BY THE TIME WE GOT DONE WITH
THEIR CREATIVE SUGGESTIONS,

312
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:26,438
OUR HUGE ROCK HAD TURNED
INTO A GRAVEL DRIVEWAY.

313
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:28,440
NOW WE GOTTA CHANGE OUR MEDIUM.

314
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,042
WE'RE SWITCHING TO STEEL.

315
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,544
GOOD IDEA --
STEAL A STATUE.

316
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,279
NO, HAROLD, NO, NO.

317
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:34,880
NO, NO, NO, NO, HAROLD.

318
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,549
WE'RE GONNA GET
OUR WELDING GEAR

319
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,050
AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE

320
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,553
THE FOUR HORSEMEN
OF THE APOCALYPSE

321
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,021
OUT OF "K" CARS.

322
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,355
WOW!

323
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,057
NOW, THAT'S INNOVATIVE!

324
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,259
A STATUE THAT GETS
DECENT MILEAGE

325
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,061
AND A SEVEN-YEAR WARRANTY.

326
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,964
[audience laughing]

327
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,434
[Red]: BACK AT BILL'S CAR,
WE'RE READY TO START HER.

328
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,571
EVERY GUY HAS HIS OWN SECRETS
FOR STARTING A CAR.

329
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,039
WITH ME, IT'S A LOT

330
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:02,007
IN THE WAY YOU TWIST THE WRIST.

331
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,009
WITH BILL,
IT'S THE WAY HE NODS.

332
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,744
WITH ME, IT'S THE TWISTING.

333
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,580
WITH BILL, IT'S THE NODDING.

334
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:11,183
WHEN WE GET GOING,
THERE'S HARDLY A VEHICLE--

335
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,587
WE CAN USUALLY GET HER--
WE CAN USUALLY...

336
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:18,657
BUT NOT IN THIS CASE, IT SEEMS,
SO BILL'S GETTING OUT.

337
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,259
GONNA CHECK UNDER THE HOOD.

338
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,727
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

339
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,162
WHAT DO YOU WANT? HUH?

340
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,663
OH, YEAH, OK.

341
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,532
OPEN THE HOOD, ALL RIGHT.

342
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,534
OHHHH!

343
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:32,371
OH, GOLLY, IT'S GOT ONE OF THEM
SPRING-LOADED HOODS.

344
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:33,706
YOU ALL RIGHT?

345
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,040
OK, UP SHE COMES.

346
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,976
THERE SHOULD BE A BAR THERE.

347
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,844
SHOULD BE SOMETHING THERE--

348
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:42,047
SHOULD BE A BAR TO HOLD THAT,
SOME TYPE OF BAR.

349
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,617
BILL, NO, I BELIEVE
THAT'S A DIPSTICK.

350
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:48,053
ACTUALLY, THERE'S A COUPLE
OF THEM I'M LOOKING AT.

351
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,422
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S GONNA WORK,

352
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,691
NO MATTER HOW LONG YOU DO IT.

353
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,460
WHAT HAVE WE GOT THERE?

354
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:57,963
THAT'S THE COAT HANGER
FROM EARLIER IN THE SHOW.

355
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,900
I'M NOT SURE A COAT HANGER
WOULD HOLD UP A HOOD.

356
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:04,069
WOULD THAT MAKE
A LOT OF SENSE TO YOU?

357
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:05,571
WELL, BY GOLLY!

358
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:09,575
IT DOES HOLD UP
THE WEIGHT OF THE HOOD...

359
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,577
JUST NOT FOR LONG.

360
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,078
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

361
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:14,580
OH, OPEN THE HOOD!

362
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,315
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

363
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,816
GOTCHA, GOTCHA.

364
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,251
IS THAT BETTER?

365
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,719
YOU ALL RIGHT? OK.

366
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,621
THIS IS GOING WAY BACK.

367
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:27,159
THEY USED TO BE ABLE TO HOOK
A CRANK INTO THE CRANKSHAFT.

368
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,628
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT
A SHAFT.

369
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:33,532
BILL'S GONNA TRY AND
TURN THE MOTOR OVER MANUALLY.

370
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,601
OH, BOY, THIS IS-- OH, OH, OH!

371
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,537
THE THING CAN START
GOING BACKWARDS ON YOU.

372
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,872
CAREFUL, THERE, BILL.

373
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,407
WATCH IT DOESN'T REVERSE.

374
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,375
LOOK OUT, SHE'S COMING
YOUR WAY!

375
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,710
ALMOST THERE -- OH, BOY!

376
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,046
LITTLE MORE -- ALMOST GOT HER.

377
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,547
OH, BOY! OH, GOSH!

378
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,982
OH, GOSH! OH, GOSH!

379
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,550
YOU ALL RIGHT, BILL?

380
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,052
LO OUT -- OH, OH, OH!

381
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,853
OH! OH! OH! OH!

382
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,188
[laughing]

383
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,891
ALL RIGHT, LET'S TRY THESE--

384
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,292
OH! GOSH!

385
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:03,562
I SHOULD KNOW BETTER
THAN TO STAND THAT CLOSE.

386
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,264
HE'S GOT JUMPER CABLES.

387
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,066
HE'S GOT THE DOUBLE SET.

388
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,736
HE'S GONNA PUT ONE END ON AND
WE'LL JUST HOOK 'EM TOGETHER.

389
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,572
IT'S AMAZING HOW MUCH POWER--

390
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,743
[sputtering]

391
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,712
... YOU CAN GET OUT

392
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,180
OF A COUPLE OF BATTERIES.

393
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,582
YEAH, THE QUICK START--
I BELIEVE THIS IS,

394
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,017
UH, ETHER.

395
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:28,520
ETHER WOULD BE A GOOD THING
TO HAVE AROUND BILL.

396
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:29,855
TAKE IT EASY, BILL.

397
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,024
YOU JUST NEED A LITTLE SQUIRT.

398
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,525
YOU DON'T NEED-- BILL.

399
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:35,828
NO, BILL, YOU'RE--
NO, BILL, THAT'S--

400
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:38,731
THAT'S ALMOST AN EXPLOSIVE,
BILL, I THINK.

401
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:41,200
I COULD BE WRONG,
BUT THAT'S AN EXPLOSIVE.

402
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,534
I COULD BE WRONG.

403
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,570
TWO CANS YOU'VE EMPTIED?

404
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:47,006
I COULD BE WRONG ABOUT THAT.

405
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,540
[explosion]

406
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:49,975
OHHHHH!

407
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:53,545
NO, I THINK I GOT IT
PRETTY MUCH RIGHT ON, THERE.

408
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,047
OH, BOY.

409
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,548
WHERE'S THE HOOD?

410
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,051
OH, THERE IT IS.

411
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,687
ALL RIGHT, UH...
IS THE ENGINE RUNNING?

412
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,555
IT'S NOT JUST RUNNING.

413
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,557
IT LEFT!

414
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:09,561
SO WE GOTTA FIND
AN ALTERNATE MEANS OF POWER.

415
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:13,132
GOOD GAS MILEAGE --
JUST TOO MUCH GAS.

416
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:19,238
STAY TUNED FOR MY BUDDY
WINSTON ROTHSCHILD,

417
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:20,639
THE KING OF PUMPS.

418
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,746
BY GOLLY, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
OUR "K" CAR STATUE.

419
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,416
I MAY NOT KNOW ART,
BUT I KNOW WHAT I LIKE,

420
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,551
AND IT'S WELDING VEHICLES
TOGETHER.

421
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,687
I KNOW I SAID THE FOUR HORSEMEN
OF THE APOCALYPSE.

422
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,856
WE HAD SO MANY CARS,
WE MADE SEVEN.

423
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:41,794
WAR, DEATH, FAMINE, SLEEPY,
DOPEY, GRUMPY, AND SHEMP.

424
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,962
IT WAS SOMETHING, WASN'T IT?

425
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,231
ALL THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS
WERE GOING.

426
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,033
THE LIGHTS WERE TURNED ON.

427
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,503
EVERY RADIO WAS TUNED
TO THE PORT ASBESTOS STATION.

428
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,373
IT WAS ONLY TIME AND WEATHER,
BUT STILL...

429
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,542
IT WAS A MULTI-MEDIA DISPLAY

430
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:59,378
OF KINETIC ART
AND SOCIAL COMMENTARY.

431
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,046
WHOO-HOO!

432
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,715
WHERE DID YOU LEARN
TO TALK LIKE THAT?

433
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:07,119
THE LIBRARIAN SAID THAT,
AND SHE WAS REALLY EXCITED

434
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:10,322
UNTIL SHE REALIZED
ONE OF THE "K" CARS WAS HERS.

435
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,057
JUDGING FROM HER LANGUAGE,

436
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,626
I BET SHE READS
A LOT OF D.H. LAWRENCE.

437
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,129
SHE WASN'T THE ONLY ONE
NOT IMPRESSED WITH YOUR WORK.

438
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:20,799
THE POLICE STUCK A TICKET
UNDER EVERYBODY'S WINDSHIELD.

439
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:23,836
THERE WERE SIX FOR PARKING
AND ONE LITTERING.

440
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:26,238
WE GAVE THE CARS BACK,
BUT WE GOT AN IDEA.

441
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:27,840
INSTEAD OF MAKING A STATUE,

442
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,842
WE'LL TAKE SOMETHING
WE ALREADY HAVE

443
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,176
AND CALL IT A STATUE.

444
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,345
WE SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT OF THIS BEFORE.

445
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,314
SOMETHING YOU ALREADY HAVE?

446
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,416
LIKE WHAT? LIKE A LAWN MOWER?

447
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:40,786
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED ART?

448
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,621
YOUR BEER CAN COLLECTION?

449
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,990
YOUR POLYESTER PANT
WALL HANGING?

450
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,925
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT PORTION.

451
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:49,895
ON THIS WEEK'S EXPERT PORTION,
WE HAVE EXPERTS:

452
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:53,866
MY UNCLE RED AND HIS FRIEND,
MR. WINSTON ROTHSCHILD.

453
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:56,869
[applause and cheering]

454
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:59,004
[whistling]

455
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,874
FIRST LETTER GOES AS FOLLOWS:
"DEAR EXPERTS...

456
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,208
WAHHHH!

457
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:06,879
"WHAT'S THE SECRET
TO GETTING A GREAT JOB?"

458
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,447
[laughing]

459
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:11,917
IF MY UNCLE KNEW THAT, HE
WOULDN'T BE HOSTING
 THIS
 SHOW.

460
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,886
THE KEY TO A GREAT JOB

461
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:17,322
IS TO HAVE AN UNCLE
THAT OWES YOUR FATHER MONEY.

462
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,291
UH, WELL,
ACTUALLY,

463
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,060
I HAVE TO DIVERGE WITH YOU
FOR A SECOND, RED.

464
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:25,297
MY DAD OWED ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE
ALL KINDS OF THINGS.

465
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,332
THE ONLY JOB
THAT EVER GOT ME WAS

466
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:31,003
A GUY CAME UP TO ME AND SAID,
"IF YOU BEAT UP ANOTHER GUY,"

467
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,905
HE WOULDN'T BEAT UP MY FATHER.

468
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,406
[audience laughing]

469
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:35,741
WE WOULDN'T ASK YOU

470
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,777
WHAT A GREAT JOB WAS ABOUT,
ANYWAY, WINSTON.

471
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,112
[laughing]

472
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,613
WELL, UH...

473
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,916
[laughing]

474
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:46,018
I DON'T AGREE,
ESPECIALLY

475
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:47,819
IF THE GUY EXPIRES TO OWN

476
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,856
HIS OWN SEWAGE
AND SEPTIC SUCKING SERVICE.

477
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,824
MR. ROTHSCHILD,
I THINK

478
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,326
YOU MEAN
"ASPIRES".

479
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,296
NO, "EXPIRES" IS
RIGHT ON THE MONEY.

480
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,830
YEAH, WELL,
ANYWAY,

481
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:03,368
THE KEY TO A GOOD CAREER IS
FINDING THE KEY TO THAT CAREER.

482
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:07,673
THAT'S KEY, AND, YOU KNOW,
I HAPPEN TO HAVE FOUND THE KEY

483
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:10,876
TO THE SEWAGE
AND SEPTIC SUCKING BUSINESS.

484
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,244
BLOCKED
SINUSES?

485
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,880
NO, NO, NO.

486
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:18,317
[audience laughing]

487
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,919
THE KEY TO SUCCESSFUL
SEWAGE SUCKING

488
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,888
IS THE PERSONAL TOUCH, EH?

489
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,424
YOU'VE GOT TO CHAT UP
THE CUSTOMERS.

490
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,759
YOU GOTTA MAKE THEM
FEEL AT HOME,

491
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,361
MAKE 'EM FEEL SPECIAL.

492
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,263
CATER TO THEIR EVERY NEED.

493
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,466
'CAUSE IN MY BUSINESS,
THE CUSTOMER IS KING.

494
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,835
ONLY WHILE
THEY'RE ON THE THRONE.

495
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,337
OOOH!

496
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,773
[laughing and applause]

497
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,712
WELL, IT TOOK US A WHILE,

498
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:49,481
BUT WE FINALLY GOT
A NEW STATUE IN TOWN

499
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,284
BY JUST USING SOMETHING
WE ALREADY HAD.

500
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,919
NOT BUSTER HADFIELD'S STOVE.

501
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,454
NO, NOTHING STUPID, HAROLD.

502
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,189
DIDN'T USE
THOSE UNUSED EXER-CYCLES

503
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,523
THE GUYS BROUGHT IN.

504
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,926
SOMEBODY SUGGESTED
WE HAVE OLD MAN SEDGWICK

505
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,961
STAND THERE
AND PRETEND HE'S A STATUE,

506
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,097
BUT WE WANTED SOMETHING
MORE LIFELIKE.

507
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:06,932
HAVEN'T YOU FIGURED IT OUT?

508
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,068
ART TAKES TALENT --
THAT'S WHAT'S MISSING HERE.

509
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,104
NOT THE MATERIALS OR SUPPLIES.

510
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,806
ART IS IN THE ARTIST,
NOT IN THE PALETTE.

511
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,475
NO, THAT'S
RIGHT, HAROLD.

512
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,810
WE DECIDED TO USE THE FAN-BOAT.

513
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:20,445
WE'VE GIVEN UP ON ART.

514
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,881
WE'RE GONNA GO
WITH PRACTICALITY.

515
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,950
T-T-THE FAN-BOAT'S
THE NEW STATUE?

516
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,885
TOWN COUNCIL WON'T ALLOW THAT.

517
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,387
YES, THEY WILL, HAROLD.

518
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:32,124
THE FAN BLOWS OVER THE LAKE,
BREEZE ALL THE TIME,

519
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,592
KEEPS THE BUGS AWAY

520
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:37,095
AND GUARANTEES YOU'RE UPWIND
FROM STINKY PETERSON'S PLACE.

521
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,998
THEY WON'T LET IT SIT THERE,
BLOWING OVER THE LAKE.

522
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,234
THEY WILL, BECAUSE
THE MAYOR HAS A SAILBOAT.

523
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,535
YEAH?

524
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:45,037
GET IT?

525
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:47,372
WAHHH?
I'M
TELLING YOU,

526
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,041
WE'VE CREATED A STATUE.

527
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,109
WE GOT THE MAYOR ON THE LAKE

528
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,944
WHERE HE CAN'T MAKE MISTAKES,

529
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,913
AND WE KILLED A COUPLE
OF HOURS.

530
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,416
IF THAT ISN'T ART,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

531
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:02,854
[laughing and applause]

532
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,856
NO, I'M SURE
YOU DON'T.

533
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:06,858
[possum squeal]

534
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,360
SEE, THAT'S
MEETING TIME.

535
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:11,363
I'LL BE DOWN
IN A FEW MINUTES.

536
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,698
THIS WAS QUITE A DAY.

537
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,266
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

538
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,468
I'M COMING HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

539
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,037
MAYBE WHEN WE'RE SITTING
OUT BY THE LAKE

540
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,773
AND YOU HEAR A LOUD NOISE
AND LOT OF WIND,

541
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,176
YOU CAN BE SURE
THAT I'M RESPONSIBLE.

542
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,611
THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

543
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,514
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND HAROLD AND THE GANG,

544
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:31,383
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

545
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,386
[applause and cheering]

546
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:35,887
[possum squeal]

547
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,456
[Harold]: ALL RISE!

548
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,397
[All]: QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

549
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:53,538


550
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:55,374


551
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,075


552
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:58,410


553
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,912


554
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:03,515


555
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:07,252
I WAS TELLING YOU EARLIER
THAT PEOPLE MAKE THINGS.

556
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:10,055
THE POSSUM LODGE SIGN
IS MADE BY THE SAME--

557
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,857
THIS GUY MADE THIS
AND BROUGHT THIS IN.

558
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,358
YOU FLIP IT AROUND...

559
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:14,860
IT'S JUST FANTASTIC.

560
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:16,328
HE'S JIM JACKSON.

561
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,863
HE LIVES IN SIMCOE.

562
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:20,432
POSSUM LODGE MEMBER 4118.

563
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:26,271
AND, UH, BOY, IS THAT
EVER GONNA BURN GOOD.

564
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:34,946
