00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:10,076
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

3
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:11,578
HERE HE IS,

4
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:13,079
THE JOLLY GREEN GENT,

5
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:14,581
THE MAN FROM PLAID,

6
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:16,216
THE PILLSBURY DOUGH BOY

7
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:18,218
WITHOUT THE DOUGH, MY UNCLE,

8
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:22,055
YOUR HERO, RED GREEN!

00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:25,959
[applause and cheering]

10
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:34,801
BIG WEEK AT THE LODGE.

11
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,770
JUNIOR SINGLETON'S BEEN AWAY.

12
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:38,271
WHEN HE CAME HOME,

13
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:39,739
THE MILK IN HIS FRIDGE

14
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,608
HAD TURNED LUMPY AND FUZZY.

15
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:45,311
IT LOOKED LIKE LITTLE EGGPLANTS
DROWNED IN YOGHURT.

16
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,580
MILK SHOULDN'T GO BAD
THAT FAST

17
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:50,183
AS LONG AS THE FRIDGE
IS TURNED ON.

18
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,719
IT WAS TURNED ON --
IT WASN'T PLUGGED IN.

19
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:56,222
I DON'T THINK JUNIOR
UNDERSTANDS ELECTRICITY.

20
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,724
UNCLE RED,

21
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,426
DIDN'T HE WIRE THE LODGE?

22
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:02,362
YUP -- IT'S FINE UNLESS
YOU PLUG ANYTHING IN.

23
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,297
RATHER THAN THROW
THE MILK AWAY,

24
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,399
WHICH WOULD BE
A WASTE OF MONEY,

25
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:09,202
JUNIOR HAS DECIDED
TO MAKE HIS OWN CHEESE.

26
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,172
SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
A SHOW WITH CHEESE,

27
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,307
YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

28
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:19,312

31
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:31,257
(Red): BILL GIVES MY VAN

32
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:32,659
A MILK BATH.

33
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,594
WINSTON BRINGS
SOMETHING SPECIAL

34
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:37,330
TO THE SHOW-AND-TELL
DEPARTMENT.

35
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:41,334
THEN HAROLD -- UH, I THINK
HE HAS A MOUSE UP HIS LEG.

36
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:44,337
I'VE GOT SOME TERMITE DAMAGE
IN THE BARN.

37
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,809
[audience laughing]

38
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,245
I'M READY FOR ANYTHING NOW,
HAROLD.

39
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:53,746
JUNIOR'S
HOMEMADE CHEESE

40
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:56,049
GETTING A LITTLE RIPE, IS IT?

41
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,585
THE CHEESE
HAS ATTRACTED AN ANIMAL.

42
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:02,355
NOW IT'S LIVING INSIDE
THE WALLS OF JUNIOR'S HOUSE.

43
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,624
PROBABLY JUST A MOUSE.

44
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,326
THAT'S WHAT I THINK.

45
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:09,129
BUT, I BETTER TAKE THIS --
THERE MIGHT BE TWO OF THEM.

46
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:13,500
YOU'RE AFRAID OF A MOUSE,
A LITTLE, WEE, TINY MOUSE.

47
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:16,903
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S
A MOUNTAIN LION OR ANYTHING.

48
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,571
I'D PREFER A MOUNTAIN LION.

49
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,341
BIGGER IS BETTER --
THE SIZE OF THE ANIMAL

50
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:24,677
IS INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL
TO THE AMOUNT OF FEAR.

51
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,813
GUYS THAT WILL STARE DOWN
A BEAR,

52
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,582
GO NUTS WHEN THEY SEE
A THREE-INCH SPIDER.

53
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,285
I WONDER WHY? --
OH, I KNOW!

54
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:33,820
I BETCHA I KNOW WHY!

55
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:37,023
A BEAR CAN'T CRAWL INTO YOUR
UNDERWEAR WHEN YOU'RE SLEEPING.

56
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,794
[laughing and applause]

57
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:44,797
OH YEAH? --
TELL THAT TO MOOSE THOMPSON.

58
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,299
OH YEAH!

59
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,800
THAT WAS
FUNNY.

60
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,903
THAT WAS A BIG FELLA.

61
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,172
YOU'RE DRESSED LIKE
THE TERMINATOR

62
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:54,674
TO TAKE ON A MOUSE? --
HOW BIG IS IT?

63
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,976
OR SHOULD I SAY
HOW LITTLE IS IT?

64
00:02:57,043 --> 00:03:00,813
IT'S ABOUT THE SAME SIZE
AT THAT ONE ON YOUR PANT LEG.

65
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,315
GET IT OFF!

66
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,816
GET IT OFF!

67
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:06,853
GET IT OFF!

68
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,990
(Red): WITH JUNIOR MAKING
THE HOMEMADE CHEESE,

69
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:14,627
BILL THOUGHT HE'D SHOW YOU
HOW TO MAKE CHEESE,

70
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:18,831
KIND OF AN EDUCATIONAL SEGMENT
ON THE SHOW THIS WEEK.

71
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:21,167
"STEP ONE: PURE MILK."

72
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,403
START WITH PURE MILK.

73
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:26,472
AND, TO A LOT OF THE KIDS
AT HOME, MAYBE,

74
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,675
OR SOME OF THE OLDER KIDS --

75
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,176
NO, YOU GOT THAT...

76
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,678
OK, START AGAIN.

77
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:33,479
A LOT OF EDUCATIONAL SHOWS

78
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,782
SHOW YOU
WHEN THINGS GO PERFECTLY.

79
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,784
THAT'S NOT THE WAY LIFE GOES.

80
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,886
A LOT OF TIMES
THINGS GO BADLY,

81
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,889
IT'S GOOD TO SEE
WHEN YOU MEET AN OBSTACLE...

82
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,291
WOULD YOU JUST...

83
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:49,796
ALL RIGHT, THAT WOULD BE
GOING IN THAT PAIL,

84
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,798
WOULD IT NOT?

85
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,299
HMM.

86
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:57,737
UH, SO THE IDEA IS
YOU GET THE MILK INTO THE PAIL.

87
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,806
ALWAYS HAVE EXTRA BAGS.

88
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,808
YOU CAN USE HEAT.

89
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,309
BILL, NO, NO, NO.

90
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,311
YOU'RE GONNA SCALD THE MILK.

91
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,313
THIS IS GOOD THOUGH.

92
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,149
TRIAL AND ERROR
IS A BIG PART OF EDUC--

93
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,018
WHAT'S GOING ON?

94
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,320
ALL RIGHT,
NOW THOSE ARE OPEN.

95
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,888
NOW WHAT?

96
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,390
OK, PLAN "B".

97
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,425
THIS IS STILL PURE MILK.

98
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,327
THESE ARE THE CARTONS.

99
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,829
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

100
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,631
THE PLASTIC, FOR SOME KIDS,

101
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,833
MAYBE THEY'RE A BIT
HARD TO OPEN.

102
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,702
THESE HAVE GOT THE POUR SPOUT
UNIT ON THERE.

103
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,839
WE MAY NOT HAVE TIME
TO ACTUALLY MAKE THE CHEESE

104
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,340
DURING THIS SEGMENT.

105
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,076
WE'LL COME BACK LATER
AND MAKE THE CHEESE.

106
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,811
YOU GET THE MILK IN THERE.

107
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,347
WE'LL COME BACK -- OH.

108
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,953
YOUR WIFE'S RELATIVES
ARE COMING OVER AT 9:30.

109
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,290
YOU'D LIKE IT TO BE
A SHORT VISIT -- NO PROBLEM.

110
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,792
YAK WITH THEM
FROM 9:30 TO 9:45.

111
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:56,896
AT 9:45 YOU STOP TALKING,
THEY GET BORED, THEY GO HOME.

112
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,600
10:00, TRY AND GET THE WIFE
TO DO THE SAME THING.

113
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:04,404
10:15, GET THEM TO DO
THE SAME THING.

114
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,173
10:30, YOU START TURNING
THE LIGHTS OUT.

115
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,044
MAYBE TRY YAWNING REAL LOUD
AND FALL DOWN ON THE FLOOR.

116
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,347
10:45, SNEAK OUT
TO THE DRIVEWAY

117
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,482
AND START THEIR CAR.

118
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:19,018
11:00, YOU PUT ON YOUR PYJAMAS

119
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:22,021
AND YELL "GOOD NIGHT"
FROM UPSTAIRS.

120
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,523
DON'T FEEL GUILTY.

121
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:26,159
WE ALL NEED MORE SLEEP
AS WE GET OLDER.

122
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:27,660
THEY'RE RELATIVES.

123
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,329
THEY'LL FORGIVE YOU EVENTUALLY.

124
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,331
YOU DON'T OWE ANYBODY.

125
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:34,033
DARN RIGHT --
NO SENSE STAYING UP LATE

126
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,837
JUST BECAUSE OF SOME STUPID
NEW-YEAR'S-EVE TRADITION.

127
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,405
[applause]

128
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:43,743
OF ALL THE THINGS
THAT MATTER IN LIFE 

129
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,945
NOTHING'S AS IMPORTANT
AS FRIENDS 

130
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,014
PALS THAT
YOU CAN LEAN ON 

131
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,116
AT THE BEGINNING,
MIDDLE AND END 

132
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,418
I SHARE MY PROBLEMS
WITH MY FRIENDS 

133
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,620
'CAUSE THAT'S
WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR 

134
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,723
NOW I OWE THEM
SO MUCH MONEY 

135
00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:00,593
THEY TEND NOT TO
COME AROUND ANY MORE 

136
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,095
WHAT?!

137
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,863
NOTHING, HAROLD.

138
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,998
NOBODY LIKES UNWANTED PESTS

139
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,633
INVADING THEIR HOUSE.

140
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,802
THAT'S WHY THERE ARE SO FEW

141
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,304
FAMILY REUNIONS.

142
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,006
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE FOUR-LEGGED KIND,

143
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,608
MICE, RACCOONS, BEARS.

144
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,044
I THOUGHT I'D USE
"HANDYMAN CORNER"

145
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,547
TO DETECT WHETHER OR NOT
YOU HAVE AN ANIMAL PROBLEM.

146
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,316
EVERYBODY'S HOUSE IS DIFFERENT.

147
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:27,420
YOUR LIVING ROOM MIGHT HAVE
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DECOR.

148
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,155
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.

149
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:32,358
THE SIGNS OF ANIMAL
AND INSECT INFESTATION

150
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,327
ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME.

151
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,828
TAKE THIS BEAM.

152
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,997
WE'VE GOT SOME TERMITE DAMAGE.

153
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,601
IF WE LET THIS GO,
THIS COULD BECOME A WRITE-OFF.

154
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,903
THE FIRST THING WE WANT TO DO,

155
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,205
WE'VE GOT TO
KILL THE TERMITES.

156
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:49,642
[coughing]

157
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:52,745
[coughing]

158
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,416
NOT ONLY KILLED THE TERMITES,

159
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:59,786
PROBABLY TOOK A HEALTHY BITE
OUT OF THE OZONE.

160
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,387
TAKE A COUPLE OF BOARDS.

161
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:04,090
STRAP THEM UP
ON EITHER SIDE OF THE BEAM.

162
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:07,026
THIS WAY YOU RESTORE
ITS ORIGINAL STRENGTH.

163
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:11,798
[creaking]

164
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,800
THAT WAS MY FAULT.

165
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:16,302
I SHOULD HAVE DUCT-TAPED THAT.

166
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,804
DOESN'T MATTER THOUGH.

167
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,808
WE'VE GOT LOTS OF OTHER BEAMS
HOLDING THE BUILDING UP.

168
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:25,812
BUT SOMEBODY SHOULD
KEEP AN EYE ON THAT.

169
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:28,281
COULD BE DANGEROUS --
NO, IT'S FINE.

170
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:31,184
YOU MAY HAVE SOME ROOMS
YOU HARDLY EVER USE,

171
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,320
LIKE A FITNESS ROOM,
A GUEST ROOM OR A LIBRARY.

172
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,122
CHECK THEM ONCE IN A WHILE.

173
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,324
COULD HAVE
SOME UNWANTED VISITORS.

174
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,827
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, EH?

175
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,395
DROPPINGS.

176
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,630
I HATE TO SAY "DROPPINGS"
ON TELEVISION, BUT,

177
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,332
IT'S BETTER THAN
THE OTHER TERMS.

178
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,835
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
MOUSE DROPPINGS,

179
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,404
THEY'RE LIKE
THOSE TART-TOPPING THINGS.

180
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,408
RABBIT DROPPINGS ARE MORE LIKE
THE CHOCOLATE-COVERED RAISIN.

181
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,678
RACCOON DROPPINGS,
THAT'S A BIGGER CANDY BAR YET.

182
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:02,782
IF YOU FIND ENOUGH DROPPINGS,
IT WILL CURE YOUR SWEET TOOTH.

183
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,350
OH MY GOSH.

184
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:10,022
ALL RIGHT.

185
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,959
UH...
QUITE A QUANTITY OF HER THERE.

186
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,861
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE HAD

187
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:18,297
A HERD OF SHETLAND PONIES
UP IN THIS AREA.

188
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:22,301
ANYWAY, IF YOU DO FIND
DROPPINGS IN YOUR HOUSE,

189
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,470
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD SIGN

190
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,406
THAT THEY'RE
SNEAKING IN SOMEWHERE.

191
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:30,309
YOU MUST HAVE SOME HOLE
SOMEWHERE.

192
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,111
IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,

193
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,680
I'D SAY WE HAD
A WALL MISSING HERE.

194
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,916
CHECK THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR HOME

195
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,819
FOR HOLES
ANIMALS COULD BE GETTING IN.

196
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,822
THIS MORTAR HAS FALLEN AWAY
FROM THESE STONES.

197
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,625
THAT HOLE'S BIG ENOUGH
FOR A MOUSE OR BAT,

198
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,761
EVEN A RACCOON
IF THEY'RE MOVING FAST ENOUGH,

199
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,263
LIKE THEY BOUNCED OFF

200
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,265
THE FENDER OF
A SPEEDING VEHICLE.

201
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,467
SOME OF THIS IS SURFACE WEAR.

202
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,369
DOESN'T GO THROUGH.

203
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,604
FIND OUT IF THE HOLE
GOES THROUGH.

204
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,439
GET A BIT OF WATER.

205
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:03,409
POUR THAT IN THERE.

206
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,479
IF YOU GET WATER
SHOWING UP IN YOUR BASEMENT

207
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,415
THAT WASN'T THERE
BEFORE YOU DID THE TEST,

208
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,851
WELL, THEN YOU'VE GOT
A PROBLEM.

209
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:15,321
CHECK YOUR WHOLE HOUSE
FOR ANY KIND OF CRACK,

210
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:19,191
EVEN THE SMALLEST HOLE
WHERE ANIMALS COULD GET IN.

211
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,527
DO THAT UNTIL
YOU RUN OUT OF WATER

212
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,896
OR YOU GET BORED
OUT OF YOUR MIND.

213
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,464
IF YOU'VE GOT ANIMALS,

214
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:28,234
YOU'RE BETTER TO DEAL
WITH THEM RIGHT AWAY

215
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,703
THAN TO LET HER GO
TO THE POINT WHERE

216
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,940
THEY START FIGHTING YOU
FOR USE OF THE BATHROOM.

217
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:37,276
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

218
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,845
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

219
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,783
OF COURSE, A FIRE IS A GOOD WAY
OF GETTING RID OF MICE.

220
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:46,285
I'D ONLY USE THAT
AS A LAST RESORT.

221
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,322
AND YOU WANT TO WAIT
TILL THE WATER DRIES.

222
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:52,758
[whistling nonchalantly]

223
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:56,896
STAY TUNED FOR MORE ADVICE
FROM DALTON AND I.

224
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,070
SOON YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF
GOING ON AND ON

225
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,339
ABOUT EVERY TOPIC
UNDER THE SUN.

226
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,274
YOU'RE GOING TO WONDER

227
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,277
"WHY AM I SUDDENLY
'THE ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNICA'

228
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,945
"IN SHORTS AND A T-SHIRT?

229
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:17,717
"AND WHY THIS OVERWHELMING URGE
TO TELL ANYONE WITH EARS?"

230
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,519
WELL, YOU'RE
A MIDDLE-AGED MAN NOW,

231
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:23,389
AND MIDDLE-AGED MEN
KNOW EVERYTHING.

232
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,890
OH YEAH.

233
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,394
MIDDLE-AGED MEN KNOW
THE BEST ROUTE ON ANY HIGHWAY

234
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,663
FROM ANYPLACE TO ANOTHER PLACE.

235
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,999
WE KNOW HOW TO FIX STUFF.

236
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:36,369
WE KNOW HOW TO CUT THE LAWN
PROPERLY.

237
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:37,903
WE KNOW EVERYTHING.

238
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,574
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP
THIS KNOWLEDGE TO YOURSELF.

239
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,242
I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW

240
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:47,413
YOUR NEIGHBOUR'S PLANTING
THAT SHRUB THE WRONG WAY.

241
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,315
I, TOO, HAVE SEEN MY WIFE

242
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,917
WALLPAPER THE BEDROOM
THE HARD WAY.

243
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,419
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

244
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:57,423
WHEN THEY FIND OUT HOW SMART
WE ARE, THEY GET JEALOUS.

245
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,824
I DON'T KNOW WHO SAID

246
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,594
"A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE
IS A DANGEROUS THING."

247
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,130
I'M GUESSING IT WAS
A MIDDLE-AGED MAN.

248
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:06,899
WHATEVER YOU KNOW,
AND I KNOW IT'S A LOT,

249
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:10,436
KEEP IT UNDER YOUR HAT
AND YOU'LL KEEP YOUR FRIENDS.

250
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,971
BELIEVE ME -- I KNOW.

251
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,040
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

252
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:15,941
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

253
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,477
[applause and cheering]

254
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:22,982
WELCOME TO "THE EXPERTS"
PORTION OF THE SHOW.

255
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,384
THIS WEEK WE HAVE
TWO EXPERTS,

256
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,888
MY UNCLE RED,
AND MR. WINSTON ROTHSCHILD.

257
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:32,391
[applause and cheering]

258
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,495
THE LETTER GOES: "DEAR EXPERTS,

259
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,898
"MY WIFE SAYS
SHE WANTS A FACE-LIFT,

260
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:42,168
"BUT I THINK SHE LOOKS
JUST GREAT THE WAY SHE IS.

261
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,937
"HOW CAN I CONVINCE HER
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL?"

262
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:48,240
FIRST, YOU WANT TO
IS AVOID CERTAIN WORDS.

263
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,676
"SAGGY," "WRINKLED,"
"WEATHER-BEATEN".

264
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,645
[laughing]

265
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,780
TALK ABOUT HOW COSMETIC SURGERY

266
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,916
IS A WASTE OF
MEDICAL RESOURCES.

267
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,852
THIS IS MONEY DOCTORS
SHOULD BE SPENDING ON

268
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,954
THINGS LIKE LIVER TRANSPLANTS,

269
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:05,658
'CAUSE AS LONG AS YOU CAN KEEP
SOCKING BACK THE BOOZE,

270
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,494
YOU WON'T CARE
WHAT YOUR WIFE LOOKS LIKE.

271
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,497
[laughing]

272
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:15,034
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT
SELF-HELP GURU AND

273
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:18,170
KING OF THE INFOMERCIALS,
ANTHONY ANTHONY, SAYS.

274
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,673
HE SAYS WHATEVER
PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR.

275
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,542
ANTHONY SAYS
IF YOU LOOK AFTER THE SURFACE,

276
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,878
THE CENTRE
WILL LOOK AFTER ITSELF.

277
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,446
YEAH, ANTHONY ANTHONY

278
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:30,883
HAS ALWAYS SAID YOU ONLY FEEL
AS GOOD AS YOU LOOK.

279
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,718
IF THAT WAS TRUE,

280
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,354
THE GUYS AT THE LODGE
WOULD BE ALL DEAD.

281
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,657
I THINK YOU'LL HAVE TO
COME TO GRIPS WITH THE FACT

282
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:41,393
THAT PEOPLE JUDGE YOU
BY YOUR APPEARANCE.

283
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,230
TAKE ME --
IF IT WEREN'T FOR

284
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:48,200
MY GREAT LOOKS,
WOULD I BE WHO I AM TODAY?

285
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,236
THE KING OF THE SEPTICS?

286
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,737
EXACTLY!

287
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,806
HIT THE NAIL RIGHT ON THE HEAD.

288
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:57,209
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
WHAT THESE PEOPLE CAN DO.

289
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,246
THEY'VE GOT THAT THING,
UH, HIPPOSUCTION.

290
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:01,747
[laughing]

291
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,249
I MEAN,

292
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:06,318
THEY CAN EVEN GIVE YOU
A FANNY TRANSPLANT.

293
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,721
WORK THE PROBLEM FROM BOTH ENDS.

294
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,524
I'VE HAD THE FACE-LIFT,
THE TUMMY TUCK,

295
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,025
THE TUSHY IMPLANTS.

296
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,593
TUSHY IMPLANTS?

297
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,430
OH YEAH, CHECK THIS OUT.

298
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,900
GO AHEAD, RED,
FEEL THE QUALITY.

299
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,368
THANKS ANYWAY, WINSTON.

300
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:26,372
I'M SURE YOU'VE GOT
THE BEST SEAT IN THE HOUSE.

301
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,207
[laughing]

302
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,708
HAROLD?

303
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,710
OH,
OH-HO-HO.

304
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,312
ALL RIGHT, NO PROBLEM.

305
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,447
SUIT YOURSELVES.

306
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,650
I DISAGREE WITH
COSMETIC SURGERY.

307
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,686
PEOPLE REALIZE
THAT BEAUTY IS ONLY SKIN DEEP.

308
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,655
YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT,
HAROLD?

309
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,523
HE'S COUNTING ON IT.

310
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,893
[applause]

311
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,564
OH, MAN.

312
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,867
I'LL TELL YOU,
THAT WAS A LIFE EXPERIENCE.

313
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,902
I HOPE YOU
DIDN'T KILL THAT MOUSE.

314
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,404
WE SURE
DID.

315
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,539
AW, THAT POOR THING WITH

316
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,541
LITTLE EYES AND NOSE

317
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,644
AND LITTLE EARS
AND THE CURLY TAIL?

318
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,646
NO -- SORRY, HAROLD,
I THOUGHT YOU SAID "HOUSE."

319
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,648
[laughing]

320
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,350
I GUESS WE WERE NERVOUS.

321
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,285
NOBODY WANTED TO GO INSIDE.

322
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,754
WE THOUGHT
WE'D SCARE THE MOUSE OUT

323
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,257
BY THROWING SHOVELS
AND GARBAGE CANS

324
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,426
AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE PLACE.

325
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:21,927
THAT DIDN'T WORK.

326
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,530
THEN WE THOUGHT WE'D PEEL
THE SIDING OFF

327
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,398
AND FLUSH HIM OUT THAT WAY.

328
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,434
JUNIOR DOESN'T HAVE SIDING.

329
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,136
YOU SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED THAT
A LITTLE EARLIER.

330
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,874
WE HAD THE FRONT EXPOSED.

331
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,510
STINKY PETERSON POINTED OUT
WE WERE AT THE WRONG HOUSE.

332
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,546
[laughing]

333
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,781
WE WERE AT
OLD LADY BENKMAN'S PLACE.

334
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:45,317
I DON'T CARE IF SHE DID
HAVE A MIGRAINE.

335
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,153
THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR
THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE.

336
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,023
[laughing and applause]

337
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:55,928
(Red): ALL RIGHT, WE'RE BACK
MAKING CHEESE WITH BILL.

338
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:59,632
WE'RE READY FOR STEP 2 OF,
I THINK THERE'S 4.

339
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:02,134
THERE'S MORE THAN TWO, ANYWAY.

340
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,602
SO NOW HE'S SET TO PUT

341
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,104
THE VINEGAR --

342
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,140
THE SIGN SAID "ED RENNET" --
YOU READ IT.

343
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,843
HE PUT EXACTLY ONE CUP
OF VINEGAR --

344
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,679
HE'S GOT THE MILK
ALREADY IN THE PAIL.

345
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,882
APPARENTLY WHEN YOU ADD
THE ONE CUP OF VINEGAR

346
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:20,085
TO THE TWO QUARTS,
OR FOUR QUARTS -- I FORGET.

347
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:23,155
THAT IS THE RIGHT KIND OF
CHEMICAL PROPORTION

348
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,224
THAT GIVES YOU
EXACTLY THE MIX

349
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,860
THAT WILL EVENTUALLY
TURN INTO CHEESE.

350
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,862
[hissing and boiling]

351
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,398
THERE'S PROBABLY A CUP
IN THERE.

352
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,200
YOU CAN HEAR
THE CHEMICAL REACTION.

353
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,670
BOY, THAT SMELLED REAL SPECIAL.

354
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:41,040
HE PULLS IT OUT
AND IT'S FORMED KIND OF --

355
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,541
THESE ARE THE CURDS.

356
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,111
THEY LOOK LIKE CURDS,
DO T THEY?

357
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:50,282
WHAT WE GOT TO DO
WITH THAT IS...

358
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,784
BASICALLY YOU HAVE

359
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,285
CHEESE-TYPE THINGS.

360
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:57,056
YOU HAVE TO, OK,
"DRAIN EXCESS LIQUID (WHEY)"

361
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,958
WHY? -- WELL, BECAUSE

362
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:01,060
YOU NEED THAT OUT OF THERE.

363
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:05,397
SO, BILL HAS THIS NIGHTIE
IN HIS POCKET FOR SOME REASON.

364
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,866
HE SPREADS THAT OUT
ON THE TABLE.

365
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,970
AND, UH, THEN WE PUT
THE "WHY" IN THERE

366
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:15,441
ON THE WHERE,
AND WHEN WOULD BE NOW, AND NOW

367
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:16,976
HE TIES THAT IN A KNOT.

368
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:20,312
THE CHEESE PORTIONS ARE SOLID,
BUT THE UNCHEESE --

369
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,348
THE NON-CHEESE AREAS
ARE LIQUID.

370
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:25,417
SO YOU'VE GOT TO GET
THE NON-CHEESE PARTICLES,

371
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,620
ANYTHING THAT'S NOT CHEESE
YOU WANT OUT OF THERE

372
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:31,323
SO THAT YOU'RE LEFT WITH
JUST THE CHEESE.

373
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,094
BUT THERE'S QUITE A BIT IN THIS
THAT'S NOT CHEESE STILL.

374
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,563
THERE IS A FAIR BIT OF CHEESE.

375
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:41,367
IT'S THE NON-CHEESE AREA
THAT WE'RE WORKING ON.

376
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,469
BILL'S USING THE BOARDS.

377
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:47,539
THAT'S A CHEESE BOARD,
I GUESS YOU'D CALL THAT.

378
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:49,074
BILL HAS AN IDEA,

379
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:52,711
WHICH IS A SIGN OF
"DANGER IS APPROACHING

380
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,213
"SO STEP BACK."

381
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:58,484
AH, THIS IS THE BOBCAT
CHEESE-SQUASHING TECHNIQUE.

382
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,888
AND, UH, HE'S GETTING
THE LIQUID OUT OF THE CHEESE.

383
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,390
STAY TUNED.

384
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,892
WE'LL EVENTUALLY FINISH THIS.

385
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,694
MAN.

386
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:12,965
STAY TUNED FOR HAROLD MAKING
ANOTHER FASHION STATEMENT.

387
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:21,540
THERE'S ONE THING THAT MICE DO
THAT NO OTHER ANIMAL CAN DO.

388
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,409
THAT IS MAKE OTHER MICE.

389
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,911
BOY, ARE THEY GOOD AT IT.

390
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:30,416
SEEMS LIKE EVERY HOUR
THERE'S ANOTHER 100 MICE

391
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,418
SCURRYING AROUND
JUNIOR'S PLACE.

392
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:36,522
HAROLD WENT OVER
TO SEE WHAT HE COULD DO.

393
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:40,292
PROBABLY TRY AND REASON
WITH THE MICE.

394
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,927
[panting]

395
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,462
HOW DID GO?

396
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,664
GOOD, FINE, FINE, GOOD.

397
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:49,868
THERE'S A LOT OF MICE
OVER THERE, UNCLE RED!

398
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:52,504
THEY HAVE A BORING LIFE --
THEY EAT AND SLEEP.

399
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,606
THEY PROCREATE
JUST TO PASS THE TIME.

400
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,375
THAT MUST BE QUITE A LIFE, EH?

401
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,943
OH,
FOR...

402
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:02,047
[laughing]

403
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:05,384
(Red): MEANWHILE,
BACK AT THE CHEESE PROJECT,

404
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,453
WE'RE STILL TRYING TO SQUEEZE

405
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,822
ALL THE LAST BITS
OF NON-CHEESE --

406
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,825
I PRONOUNCED THAT AS "WHY,"
BUT IT'S "WHEY."

407
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:15,727
AND WHAT YOU WANT IS CHEESE
WITH NO WHEY.

408
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,896
IT LOOKS LIKE NO WAY TO ME.

409
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,398
WE'RE TRYING EVERYTHING.

410
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,900
THIS IS KIND OF A LESSON
FOR YOU KIDS

411
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:25,871
THAT MAKING CHEESE
IS KIND OF LIKE LIFE.

412
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,807
THE LONGER YOU WORK AT IT,
THE RIPER IT GETS.

413
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:32,411
WE'RE GOING TO INTRODUCE
THE CENTRIFUGAL -- WAIT A SEC.

414
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,513
BILL, I'D RATHER BE THE --

415
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,415
EXCUSE ME -- THANK YOU.

416
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:39,718
I WOULD RATHER BE THE SPINNER
THAN THE SPINEE.

417
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,754
I LIKE TO BE IN
THE CENTRE OF MY UNIVERSE,

418
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:46,125
PARTICULARLY WHEN
THERE'S CHEESE INVOLVED.

419
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,427
BILL IS MORE OF A SPECTATOR.

420
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:49,928
LOOK OUT, BILL.

421
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:50,929
OH, I'M SORRY.

422
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:54,066
ANYWAY, WE GOT ALL THE WATER

423
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,934
OUT OF THE CHEESE.

424
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:57,436
LOOK AT THAT.

425
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:58,937
THAT'S PURE CHEESE.

426
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,439
THAT'S HEAD CHEESE.

427
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,074
OH, DON'T EAT THAT.

428
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,276
YOU'LL SPOIL YOUR DINNER.

429
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,278
OOO.

430
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,514
IT'S "MALE CALL".

431
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:13,452
THAT'S LOUD.

432
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,053
OK.

433
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,458
THE FIRST LETTER ON
"MALE CALL" GOES AS FOLLOWS.

434
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,828
IT'S A LETTER FROM BEB
IN NOW JORSOY.

435
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,830
WHAT?

436
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:28,167
I THINK THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
BOB IN NEW JERSEY.

437
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,935
BOB'S TYPEWRITER IS DOING

438
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,070
AN "O" AND "E" BACKWARDS.

'THO ROD GROON SHEW'.

474
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:03,328
"BOST WISHOS, BEB AND ELIVO."

475
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:08,533
WELL, BEB AND ELIVO,
THANKS FOR WRITING.

476
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,435
KOOP WATCHING.

477
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:13,438
WO LEVO YEUR CARDS AND LOTTORS

478
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:16,441
AND KOOP YEUR STICK
EN THO ICO.

479
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:17,943
WHAT'S
THAT?

480
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,445
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

481
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,947
OH, COOL.

482
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:23,015
I MEAN,
CEEL.

483
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,121
THE MICE ARE GONE?

484
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:31,056
YEAH, IT'S SAFE, HAROLD.

485
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,392
AH, GOOD.

486
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,260
I GOT TO GIVE JUNIOR CREDIT.

487
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,195
THROUGHOUT THE MOUSE PROBLEM,

488
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,464
HE WORKED ON
PERFECTING HIS CHEESE,

489
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:42,200
ADJUSTING THE FLAVOUR,
LOWERING THE FLASHPOINT.

490
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:44,336
[laughing]

491
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,104
THE MORE
HE WORKED ON THE CHEESE,

492
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:48,440
THE LESS THE MICE
BECAME INTERESTED IN IT.

493
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,475
MAYBE IT WASN'T CHEESE
ANY MORE.

494
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,244
ONLY TWO THINGS SMELL THAT BAD.

495
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,346
WE DECIDED TO
KEEP CALLING IT CHEESE.

496
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,381
[laughing]

497
00:21:56,448 --> 00:22:00,485
JUNIOR NOTICED THE MICE WEREN'T
COMING INTO THE KITCHEN,

498
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:03,622
SO HE SPREAD THE CHEESE
AROUND OTHER ROOMS,

499
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,357
AND DROVE THE MICE OUT.

500
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,292
HE THREW IT ON THE PORCH.

501
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,594
IT WAS CARRIED OFF
BY BUZZARDS.

502
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,596
THAT'S AN EXCELLENT SOLUTION.

503
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,766
NO -- HE'S BEEN CHARGED
WITH BUZZARD ABUSE.

504
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,268
[squealing]

505
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,769
MEETING TIME, UNCLE RED.

506
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,371
GO AHEAD, HAROLD.

507
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:22,407
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,
THIS REMINDS ME THAT

508
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,910
A MARRIAGE
IS LIKE A QUALITY CHEESE.

509
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:27,379
THE OLDER IT GETS,
THE SHARPER IT IS

510
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:30,315
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP
THE FRIDGE PLUGGED IN.

511
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:33,185
TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

512
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:36,355
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF, HAROLD,
AND THE GANG,

513
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,457
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

514
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,526
[applause and whistling]

515
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,464
[possum squeal]

516
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,967
(Harold): OK, HE'S HERE,
HE'S HERE.

517
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,036
STAND UP, STAND UP.

518
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,475
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

519
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,976
(Red): SIT DOWN, GUYS.

520
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,713
(Harold): THE POSSUM LODGE
ROAD CREW IS PUTTING UP SIGNS.

521
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,750
THEY SAID THEY DON'T MIND
YOU SHOOTING AT THEM.

522
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:07,452
JUST WAIT TILL THEY'RE
BACK IN THE TRUCK.

523
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:13,458


524
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,560


525
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:16,995


526
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,930


527
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:21,433


528
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,503
