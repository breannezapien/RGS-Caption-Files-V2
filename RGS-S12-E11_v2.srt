NEVER HAVING TO LOOK IN
YOUR REAR VIEW MIRROR.

00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:21,121
MY LEVEL OF WEALTH MEANS
NOT EVEN HAVING A REAR

RAIN'S TAKING
CARE OF IT.

138

YES, BUT WITH THESE
LOW LYING STORM CLOUDS,

WE'LL NEVER SEE AURORA.

OH-AHH, SHE'S YOUR
TRUE LOVE, GORD.

WHY DON'T, UM,
YOU DO IT, HUH?

144
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:06,726
CLEARLY YOU KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT WOMEN, HAROLD.

HANG ON.
STORM'S CLEARING.

OH, FORGET IT, GORD.
WE CAN'T SEE THE LIGHTS.

152
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,718
AND EVEN IF WE COULD,

153

IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF CHARGED
PARTICLES IN THE ATMOSPHERE.

IT'S NOT A GODDESS.

00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,864
[voice echoing]
GORDON, I'VE MISSED YOU.

159
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,500
WELL, I MISSED
YOU TOO, AURORA.

160
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,435
WHY HAVEN'T
YOU CALLED?

161
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,272
WELL, GEE, BABY, YOU KNOW,
THIS IS MY BUSY TIME OF YEAR.

162
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,209
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE EVER DOUBTED HIM.

163
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:58,845
WELL, TRULY,
WE ARE THE FOOLS.

164
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,379
THAT'S RIGHT.

165
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:01,948
THANKS FOR SHOWING UP,
DOLL FACE.

166
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:04,417
YOU REALLY KNOW HOW
TO LIGHT UP A ROOM, HUH?

167
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,786
[laughing]

168
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:11,157
[quirky upbeat music]

169
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,726
[applause]

170
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,731
WE'VE ALL SEEN
THESE PICKET FENCES

171
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,100
THAT PEOPLE THINK ARE
QUAINT AND RUSTIC

172
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,102
AND GIVE A SENSE
OF EASY LIVING

173
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:24,804
IN A RELAXED
RURAL ENVIRONMENT.

174
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,739
BUT LET'S NOT FORGET
THE MAIN PURPOSE OF A FENCE

175
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,574
IS TO KEEP SOMETHING IN
OR SOMETHING OUT

176
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,042
OR BOTH.

177
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,044
SO THIS TIME ON
HANDYMAN CORNER,

178
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:34,647
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU HOW TO
TURN YOUR PICKET FENCE
INTO A BILLBOARD

179
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,649
THAT'LL SEND A CLEAR
MESSAGE TO YOUR NEIGHBOURS

180
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,284
AND THE WORLD IN GENERAL.

181
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,419
FIRST THING YOU WANNA DO IS
TAKE THE PICKETS OFF THERE.

182
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,388
ALL YOU NEED FOR THAT
IS A HAMMER.

183
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,392
AND MAYBE
SOME WOOD GLUE.

184
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,595
OKAY, I KNOW I SAID
WOOD GLUE,

185
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,297
BUT YOU KNEW
I WAS KIDDING.

186
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,599
NOW YOU WANNA REMOUNT ALL
YOUR PICKETS ON THERE

187
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,602
USING JUST ONE SIX-INCH
SPIKE IN EACH ONE

188
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,037
AND JUST HELD
IN ONE PLACE

189
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:01,407
SO THE PICKET CAN KIND OF
PIVOT FROM THERE.

190
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,143
AND, YEAH, YOU CAN USE A
SMALLER NAIL IF YOU WANT TO.

191
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,178
I PREFER THE BIGGER TARGET,

192
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:07,947
BUT, HEY,
IT'S YOUR THUMB.

193
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,889
OKAY, I GOT ALL MY
PICKETS MOUNTED ON THERE,

194
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:18,724
AND THEN I'VE ATTACHED
FISHING LINE TO EACH ONE.

195
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,493
THAT'S HOW I CONTROL IT.

196
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,194
BY THE WAY, THESE ARE
WOODEN PICKETS.

197
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,462
THEY'RE NOT WILSON PICKETS.

198
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,065
HOO! HOO!
GOOD GOD, Y'ALL!

199
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,867
OW.

200
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,972
THESE FISHING LINES ARE ALL
ATTACHED TO MY BILLBOARD
CONTROL PANEL.

201
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,374
THIS IS WHERE ALL
THE THINKING CAME IN.

202
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,043
THAT TOOK A WHILE.

203
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,278
EACH LINE IS ATTACHED
TO A RING HERE,

204
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,913
AND WHEN I WANNA
FORM A CERTAIN LETTER,

205
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,916
I JUST PULL THAT RING DOWN
TO THE PEG ACROSS FROM
THAT LETTER,

206
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,252
AND THAT TURNS MY PICKET
FENCE INTO A BILLBOARD.

207
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:49,789
FOR EXAMPLE, LET'S SAY YOU'VE
GOT SOME NEW NEIGHBOURS
MOVING IN NEXT DOOR

208
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:51,991
AND YOU WANNA USE
YOUR FENCE TO SAY HELLO.

209
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,902
OKAY, BUT THEN MAYBE AFTER
THEY'VE LIVED THERE FOR
A LITTLE WHILE

210
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:06,505
YOU FIND OUT THEY LIKE TO FOOL
AROUND WITH FIREARMS
IN THE BACKYARD.

211
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,175
WELL, THAT REQUIRES
A CHANGE OF SIGNS.

212
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,567
OH, WAIT.
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

213
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,808
AND THEN WHEN YOU
FINALLY REALISE

214
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,477
THESE ARE REALLY
NOT YOUR KIND OF PEOPLE,

215
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,445
DON'T SIT ON THE FENCE.
LET THEM KNOW.

216
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,428
AND IT'S JUST THAT EASY.

217
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,397
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

218
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,898
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

219
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,400
[horn honking]

220
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:20,746
[cheers and applause]

221
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,619
[quirky upbeat music]

222
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,424
I WANT TO TALK TO ALL
YOU DADS OUT THERE

223
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,159
WHO SAY STUFF
TO YOUR KIDS LIKE,

224
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,727
SHOOT FOR THE STARS

225
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,662
OR STRIVE TO BE NUMBER ONE.

226
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,431
OH, I KNOW ALL
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO

227
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:43,202
IS POUR GASOLINE ONTO
THE SOGGY KINDLING OF
ADOLESCENT AMBITION,

228
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,804
BUT ARE YOU
HELPING THE KID

229
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,240
OR ARE YOU JUST SETTING HIM
UP FOR A LIFETIME OF
DISAPPOINTMENT?

230
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,810
'CAUSE TO HAVE
A REAL GOOD LIFE

231
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:54,013
DEPENDS MORE ON GEOMETRY
THAN IT DOES ON AMBITION.

232
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,449
SEE, SUCCESS TO ME IS
KIND OF LIKE A PYRAMID --

233
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:57,750
IT'S LIKE YOUR
OWN BODY SHAPE.

234
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,051
KINDA GOT YOUR
LITTLE POINT AT THE TOP

235
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,053
AND REAL WIDE
AT THE BOTTOM.

236
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,189
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO GET
TOO MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE

237
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,458
BECAUSE, WELL, IT
JUST DOESN'T WORK,

238
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,660
AND IT'S TOO MUCH
LIKE A GOVERNMENT.

239
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,762
AND ASK YOURSELF
THIS QUESTION,

240
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:13,232
DO YOU WANT YOUR KID TO
BEHAVE THE WAY THE GUYS
AT THE TOP DO?

241
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,934
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

242
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,038
INSTEAD, GIVE 'EM THE SAME
ADVICE THAT MADE YOU THE
MAN YOU ARE TODAY...

243
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,341
SHOOT FOR THE MIDDLE.

244
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,410
I'M TELLING YOU,
FOR MOST OF US,

245
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,912
THE MIDDLE IS WHERE
YOU WANT TO BE,

246
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,882
BECAUSE IN LIFE THE ODD TIME
YOU STUMBLE NOW AND THEN,

247
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,851
AND IF YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE,
NO MATTER WHICH WAY YOU FALL,

248
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,487
YOU GOT SOMEBODY
TO LAND ON.

249
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,422
REMEMBER,
I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

250
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,457
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

251
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,162
SOMETIMES IN LIFE,

252
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,064
THINGS START TO LOOK GRIM.

253
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:48,968
YOUR SEPTICS GET FILLED
TO WELL PAST THEIR BRIM.

254
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,936
SO CALL ME RIGHT NOW,
AND I'LL GIVE THEM A SKIM,

255
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,438
BEFORE A WALK ON THE LAWN

256
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,473
TURNS INTO A SWIM.

257
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,013
WELL, BOY,
I HAVE TO ADMIT,

258
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:04,250
I'VE TURNED RIGHT AROUND IN
THIS WHOLE ENERGY BAR THING.

259
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,685
I'VE BEEN EATING HAROLD'S
GO GO BARS HERE,

260
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,687
AND THEY'VE GOT A
REAL KICK TO THEM.

261
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,593
OH, YEAH.

262
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,662
I'LL TELL YA,
I'M MORE ALERT,

263
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:18,430
AND I'M GETTING
MORE STUFF DONE.

264
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,467
I'M EVEN LISTENING TO
PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE
TALKING TO ME NOW.

265
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,402
AND I'VE STOPPED SNORING,

266
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,838
ACTUALLY STOPPED
SLEEPING ALL TOGETHER.

267
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,108
UNCLE RED,
HAVE YOU GOT A MINUTE?

268
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,110
WELL, LET ME JUST
CHECK MY DAYTIMER.

269
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,179
YOU HAVE
A DAYTIMER?

270
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,047
YEAH, I'M A BUSY
GUY, HAROLD.

271
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,016
WE'RE MAKING A LOT OF
CHANGES TO THE LODGE, OKAY?

272
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:38,350
Harold:
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

273
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,352
HOW ARE
YOU NEXT JULY,

274
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,188
SAY, THE 23rd
AROUND 3:15?

275
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,823
GOOD. YEAH. FINE.

276
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,524
ALL RIGHT, I'LL PUT
YOU DOWN FOR 3:15.

277
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,792
I'LL HAVE MY PEOPLE
SET IT UP, OKAY?

278
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,093
YOU HAVE PEOPLE NOW?

279
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,795
HERE THEY ARE NOW.

280
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,598
DALTON, WANT TO
MEET WITH HAROLD NEXT
JULY 23rd AT 3:15.

281
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,933
WE'LL GIVE HIM
TEN MINUTES, OKAY?

282
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,534
WHAT DO
YOU GOT FOR ME?

283
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,503
OKAY, DID A MARKET
ANALYSIS ON THE
LODGE PROPERTY,

284
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,572
AND THE CONDO DEVELOPMENT
LOOKS LIKE THE WAY TO GO.

285
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,106
HAVE YOU LOST
YOUR MIND?

286
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,842
EXACTLY.
LISTEN TO
DALTON HERE.

287
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,311
THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR
IS WHERE IT'S AT.

288
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,746
I SAY WE TURN THIS DUMP
INTO A MINI-MALL.

289
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:09,281
NO. NO.

290
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,749
HOW 'BOUT THIS, GUYS...

291
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,385
WE PUT A CONDO DEVELOPMENT
ON TOP OF A MINI-MALL?

292
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,154
KA-CHING!
KA-CHING!

293
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,361
LET'S MEET TONIGHT
ON THIS, OKAY?

294
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,796
HOW 'BOUT 3:00 a.m.?

295
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,531
THAT WAY WE CAN CHECK
THE CANADIAN DOLLAR

296
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,099
WHEN THE LONDON
MARKETS OPEN.

297
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:28,200
BUT I'M GOING TO NEED
SOME MORE GO GO BARS.

00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,070
OH, NO, NO, NO.
WAIT! WAIT!

300
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,272
YOU GUYS HAD BETTER CUT
WAY BACK ON THE GO GO BARS.

301
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:34,640

00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,311
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

305
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:40,779
I DON'T HAVE ANY.

306
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,514
IT WAS JUST A TEST.
THAT'S ALL THEY SENT ME.

307
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,149
CAN'T YOU SEE WHAT'S
HAPPENING HERE?

308
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,618
YOU GUYS ARE ADDICTED
TO THE GO GO BARS.

309
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,319
NO!
NO.
NO. NO.

310
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,788
I CAN QUIT ANY
TIME I WANT.

311
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,425
I HOPE SO BECAUSE THERE
ARE NO MORE GO GO BARS.

312
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:54,760
THAT'S COOL.
FINE.

313
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,462
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

314
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,064
I AM OKAY WITH IT!

315
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,066
I'M GOOD.
I'M GOOD.

316
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,202
I'M GOOD.

317
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,671
Red (voice over):
WE HAVE AN AREA OUT
 
BEHIND THE LODGE

318
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,506
THAT SEEMS TO COLLECT A LOT 
OF GARBAGE FOR SOME REASON.
 

319
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,608
ONCE IN A WHILE WE 
GOT TO CLEAN HER ALL UP, 

320
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,444
AND WALTER AND I WERE BACK 
THERE TRYING TO GET HER 
CLEANED UP A LITTLE BIT 

321
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,847
AND WE HAD NO IDEA 
WHERE THE GARBAGE -- 

322
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,917
DALTON HAD COME BY 
ON HIS WAY TO THE DUMP 
IN A PICKUP TRUCK, 

323
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,052
AND APPARENTLY THERE 
IS A POTHOLE THERE,
 
 

324
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,987
AND WE DIDN'T SEE IT -- 

325
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:25,557
AND THIS MAY BE 
WHERE THE GARBAGE -- 

326
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,626
AND OF COURSE WE DIDN'T 
SEE IT COME ALONG,
 
 

327
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,929
BUT WE JUST KIND OF 
IGNORE THAT AND CARRY ON.
 

328
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:33,098
BUT WALTER NOTICED THAT THE 
BOARD THERE HAD A NAIL IN IT.
 

329
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:36,201
HE THOUGHT THIS MIGHT COME IN 
HANDY FOR PICKING UP PAPERS
 
AND WHAT HAVE YOU,

330
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,604
SO WE TRIED IT -- 
JUST TRIED ONE, YOU KNOW,
 

331
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:42,474
WE COULD PROBABLY PICK UP 
FOUR, FIVE OR SIX MORE
 
ALL ON THE ONE GO.

332
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,209
SO THAT'S KIND 
OF SMART THINKING. 

333
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,745
MEANWHILE I'M NOT PAYING A 
WHOLE LOT OF ATTENTION 
TO WHAT HE'S DOING. 

334
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,847
I'M JUST PICKING UP GARBAGE 
AND PUTTING IT INTO THE BAG,
 

335
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,482
AND THEN HE COMES 
OVER WITH THE THING
 

336
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:51,717
AND WANTS ME TO HOLD 
THE BAG FOR HIM. 

337
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,985
HE'S GOING TO -- 

338
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,119
OKAY, THAT'S FINE. 
THAT'S FINE. 

339
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,521
JUST DO IT. 
JUST DO IT, WALTER.
 

340
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,222
ALL RIGHT, GOOD. 

341
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,924
AND THEN HE 
COULDN'T GET THE --
 

342
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,993
HE COULDN'T ACTUALLY GET 
THE STICK BACK OUT OF 
THE THING. 

343
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,462
AND HE COULDN'T FIGURE OUT 
WHY IT WOULDN'T COME OUT.
 

344
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:07,433
SO I HAD TO POINT OUT TO HIM 
WHERE ACTUALLY THE PROBLEM 
WAS COMING FROM. 

345
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,369
AND I HAD A PRETTY GOOD 
IDEA OF WHERE IT WAS.
 

346
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,405
AND THEN OH, BOY. 
OH, BOY.
 

347
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,141
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE SO 
MUCH OF THE HOTTER FOOD. 

348
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,243
IT'S NOT THE HELLO, BUT THE 
GOOD-BYE YOU REMEMBER.
 

349
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,713
SO, UH, WE JUST 
KEPT ON CLEANING IT, 

350
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,648
BUT DALTON COMES 
BACK THE OTHER WAY,
 

351
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,583
AND THIS TIME HE'S 
GOT A GARBAGE CAN,
 

352
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,919
AND THIS TIME IT WAS WALTER'S 
TURN TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN.
 
 

353
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,423
AND YOU KNOW 
IT'S A FUNNY THING.
 

354
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:34,259
I HEARD ABOUT SOMEBODY ON THE 
AIRPLANE HAD A PROBLEM WITH
 
KIND OF AN AIRTIGHT FIT,

355
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,161
AND THIS IS 
THE SAME THING.
 

356
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,731
WALTER WAS GOING THROUGH -- 
KIND OF A SUCTION GOING
 
ON THERE,

357
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:43,035
AND, UH, CAN'T GET IT OFF, 
SO HE COMES OVER TO 
ME FOR HELP. 

358
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:47,239
AND I HAD NOTICED ON THE 
FIRST LOAD OF GARBAGE 
THAT CAME IN HERE 

359
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:50,843
THERE WERE SOME JUMPER 
CABLES AND SO -- 

360
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:54,780
I THOUGHT ONE HANDLE'S 
POSITIVE, THE OTHER 
HANDLE'S NEGATIVE, 

361
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,951
AND THEN -- I THINK THE 
BATTERY STILL HAD A
 
LITTLE BIT OF --

362
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:00,819
YOU DON'T NEED 
A LOT OF JUICE
 

363
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:03,422
TO BLOW A GARBAGE CAN OFF A 
GUY'S HINDQUARTERS, USUALLY.
 

364
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:07,292
AND, OKAY, 
THERE SHE GOES.  

365
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,462
SO THAT WORKED WELL. 

366
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:14,066
SO, MEANWHILE, 
DALTON'S GOT A 2 X 4 

367
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,068
AND THE HUBCAP COMES 
RIGHT OFF HIS WHEEL.
 

368
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:19,471
WELL, THE 2 -- 
WELL IT'S MORE OF A - 
THAT WAS MORE OF A 2 X 10.  

369
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,607
BUT WHEN THE HUBCAP HIT, 
HE SUDDENLY REALIZED 

370
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:23,042
THIS GARBAGE WAS 
COMING FROM THE ROAD,
 

371
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,277
AND I NOTICE THAT 
IT'S DALTON'S PICKUP.
 

372
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,879
THAT'S WHERE ALL 
THE GARBAGE IS COMING FROM.  

373
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:28,547
SO NOW I GOT AN IDEA -- 

374
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,849
AND I'M DANGEROUS 
WHEN I GOT AN IDEA.
 

375
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,818
SO WE CLEANED UP 
THE WHOLE AREA,
 

376
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,486
GOT HER ALL INTO 
ONE GARBAGE BAG.
 

377
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,055
GOT THAT INTO 
THE GARBAGE CAN. 

378
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,023
AND I TOLD WALTER, PUT THAT 
ON THE END OF THE 2 X 10.
 

379
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,293
AND THEN WE'LL 
EACH GRAB AN END,
 

380
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,363
AND WE'LL TAKE 
HER OVER TO THE ROAD.
 

381
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,365
AND WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS 

382
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:49,501
PUT MY END OF THE 
PLANK RIGHT OVER THE 
ACTUAL POTHOLE 

383
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:53,072
AND JUST KIND OF STAND BACK 
AND WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
 

384
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:56,809
WHAT WE'LL DO IS GET DALTON 
TO TAKE HIS OWN GARBAGE BACK.
 

385
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,515
AND TO MAKE SURE IT 
NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN,
 

386
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,318
I USED THE HUBCAP 
TO FILL THE POTHOLE. 

387
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,759
[quirky upbeat music]

388
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,296
EVER NOTICE WITH
THESE SMALL BARBEQUES

389
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,865
THAT WHEN YOU RUN THE
FLAME WIDE OPEN FOR A WHILE,

390
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,468
THE PROPANE TANK
GETS ALL FROSTY?

391
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,436
I'M SURE THERE'S A SCIENTIFIC
EXPLANATION FOR THAT,

392
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,205
BUT WHO CARES?

393
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,240
THE MAIN ISSUE IS HOW CAN
WE USE THAT SITUATION

394
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,209
TO MAKE OUR LIVES BETTER?

395
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:33,011
SO LET'S SAY YOU'RE GOING TO
MAKE YOURSELF A HAMBURGER,

396
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,481
AND YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE A
COLD DRINK TO GO WITH IT.

397
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,049
IT CAN BE ANY KIND
OF DRINK YOU WANT,

398
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,885
AS LONG AS IT HAS THE PLASTIC
HARNESS HOLDING ALL THE
CANS TOGETHER.
 

399
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,621
THE FERMENTATION
IS OPTIONAL.

400
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:46,658
MAKE A SLIT IN THE PLASTIC,
RIGHT UP THE MIDDLE.

401
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,660
THEN YOU CAN
SLIDE THE WHOLE UNIT

402
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,762
OVER THE FROSTY PART
OF THE PROPANE CYLINDER.

403
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,798
PUT YOUR BURGER
ON THERE FIRST.

404
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,239
OKAY, YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE
EVERY CAN IS TOUCHING.

405
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,040
THEN YOU GOT YOURSELF
AN INSTANT COOLER.

406
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,978
NOW YOU JUST LEAVE
HER SET ON HIGH.

407
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,447
AND BY THE TIME THE
BURGER'S HOT AND TASTY,

408
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,616
THE DRINKS'LL
BE COLD AND FROSTY.

409
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:15,053
[coughing]

410
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:42,080
WELL, WE'RE ALL
OFF THE GO GO BARS.

411
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:44,116
SO WE'RE BACK
TO HAVING NO ENERGY,

412
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,686
WHICH MEANS NOTHING'S GOING
TO CHANGE AROUND HERE,

413
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:51,023
WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE ONLY
APPEAL TO THE WHOLE
POSSUM LAKE AREA

414
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,925
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

415
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,394
A LOT OF THE GUYS HAD TROUBLE
QUITTING THE GO GO BARS
COLD TURKEY,

416
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:56,862
BUT NOT ME.

417
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,897
SEE, THE DIFFERENCE IS,
I'VE GOT A STRONG MIND.

418
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,934
WELL, I'VE GOT A
PRETTY STRONG MIND.

419
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,703
WELL, I'VE GOT A MIND.

420
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,773
WELL, THAT'S IT, UNCLE RED.
THIS TEST IS OVER.

421
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:11,109
SO WHAT DID YOU
DO WITH THOSE EXTRA
GO GO BARS I FOUND?

422
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,478
I THREW THEM ALL INTO
MERCURY CREEK, HAROLD.

423
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,747
SEE, THAT'S
WATER POLLUTION.

424
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:18,417
NOT IN
MERCURY CREEK.

425
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,352
IT CAN HANDLE
A FEW ENERGY BARS.

426
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,055
I'VE SEEN IT DISSOLVE
A SNOWMOBILE.

427
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:24,890
WELL, EITHER WAY,
I'VE PHONED THE COMPANY.

428
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:26,458
I TOLD THEM THEIR
PRODUCT IS DANGEROUS.

429
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,060
AND THE LIST OF
INGREDIENTS WAS MISLEADING.

430
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:30,028
"MAY CONTAIN CAFFEINE"?

431
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,797
IT WAS
PURE CAFFEINE!

432
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:32,998
REALLY?

433
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:35,601
YOU GOT A GO GO BAR!
YOU GOT A GO GO BAR.

434
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,336
NO, NO,
THIS IS JUST ONE

435
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,238
FROM THE ORIGINAL BATCH
THAT YOU GAVE ME, HAROLD.

436
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,406
THERE'S NO INGREDIENT
LISTING ON THERE.

437
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,208
OH, NO, NO, NO.
NOT ON THE ONES
THAT WE GAVE YOU.

438
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,010
THIS IS JUST A PLACEBO.

439
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:48,213
THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE
BUT WATER, FLOUR AND
SOME FLAVOURING.

440
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,949
YOURS WERE ALL FAKE.

441
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,051
YOU MEAN ALL THOSE
CHANGES IN ME

442
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:55,320
WERE JUST MY BRAIN
AT WORK, HAROLD?

443
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,489
SEE HOW STRONG
MY MIND IS?

444
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:00,392
[possum squealing]

445
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,060
OH, MEETING TIME!

446
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:03,762
YEAH, YOU GO
AHEAD, HAROLD.

447
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:05,731
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

448
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,432
SO IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

449
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:08,967
I'LL BE COMING HOME STRAIGHT
AFTER THE MEETING.

450
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,305
MAYBE YOU SHOULD WAIT UP.

451
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,541
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

452
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,010
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND HAROLD

453
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,611
AND THE WHOLE GANG UP
