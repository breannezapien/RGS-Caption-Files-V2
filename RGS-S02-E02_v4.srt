1
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:41,407
For those who have never seen our show before
it, don't worry.

2
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:46,279
This is it. All right. It's an eclectic mix
of reality television, with some introverted

3
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:50,316
self-awareness generally typical of the type
of show put together by a group of

4
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:52,051
underachievers with a government grant.

5
00:00:52,418 --> 00:00:56,789
And here's my uncle, who happens to be the
real dynamo of the family, which is hard for

6
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:57,891
me to admit in public.

7
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,560
But anyway, here he is, the star of Red
Green Show Mr.

8
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:01,995
Red Green.

9
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,966
Thank you. Welcome to Possum Lodge.

10
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:10,937
I have the sound turned down back there, so
I can't hear Harold's intro.

11
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,573
That's a trick you might consider for the
next time you tune us in.

12
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,677
Harold, you got an effect for us tonight,
you know, might as well give them one more

13
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:18,511
way to turn off.

14
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:20,914
How about something like this?

15
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:28,087
Well, Harold does those effects because he
can.

16
00:01:29,455 --> 00:01:32,158
Anyway, there's something kind of strange
going on at Possum Lodge this week,

17
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,460
especially with our medical officer Doc
Render.

18
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:39,932
For some reason or other, he's being nice to
people, even to the point of driving into

19
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:42,001
town in a closed vehicle or stinky Peterson.

20
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:44,604
So he figured he must be after something.

21
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:47,774
And a lot of the large members have been
complaining to me because when you get one of

22
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:51,210
the guys, you know, sucking up to everybody
and ingratiating himself and everything and

23
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,812
just reminds them of work, no.

24
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,490
To me, for the double double rent is 20.

25
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,970
What's that smell?

26
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:21,007
All right, all right for you, skunk pinhead.

27
00:02:21,707 --> 00:02:22,708
We're playing for money.

28
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,710
I never played for money that would be
gambling.

29
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:28,481
I never gambled. That's why I'm the large
treasure.

30
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:30,416
That's why you're not.

31
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,585
Well, how about this?

32
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:39,025
What if? What if you loan me, say, five
hundred bucks and then 90 days from now I pay

33
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,226
you back six hundred?

34
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,894
Hmm. That wouldn't be gambling, huh?

35
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:44,697
Doug, listening to you is gambling.

36
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,632
I will get the money from helmet.

37
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,868
Helmets got lots of money because his mom's
got lots of money.

38
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,670
She buys him stuff all the time, so she's
got the money.

39
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,305
She goes in the helmet to helmet can give it
to you.

40
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,974
That wouldn't be right. Carol wouldn't feel
good about that.

41
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:58,811
No. This was strictly an investment
opportunity that I wanted to share with my

42
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,279
good friend Douglas here.

43
00:03:00,913 --> 00:03:01,914
He's good with money.

44
00:03:01,914 --> 00:03:04,250
You know, you're a disaster with money.

45
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,087
You're a one man stock market crash stock,
you see.

46
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,491
You'll need a job to get money, and you'll
need a skill to get a job.

47
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:16,696
And you need training to get a skill and
you'll need a loan to get trained and you'll

48
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,297
need a bloody miracle to get a loan.

49
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:26,639
Case closed. You know, Doc Atlanta, the
money, but I'm a little strapped on cash

50
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,409
right now. I still owe sixty seven dollars
to the home shopping network.

51
00:03:31,043 --> 00:03:32,745
It's not so bad anymore. They repossessed my
TV.

52
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:35,081
So I'm working through it. You know,

53
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:37,550
How about you, Bill? Have you got any money?

54
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,052
Oh, never mind

55
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,722
You scrounging for cash, ganda.

56
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,491
Oh, mine are shortfall problem red.

57
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,094
That's all. We're that close to striking
oil.

58
00:03:49,328 --> 00:03:52,198
My stockbroker said It's a bad time for me
to sell.

59
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:52,732
You know,

60
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,501
I suggest that maybe he could hit helmet up
for the money.

61
00:03:56,102 --> 00:04:00,639
I'm sorry. What I meant was that he could
present an investment opportunity to helm it.

62
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:05,111
Yeah, but you know, if you don't pay him
back, you know, he'll just rip you up like a

63
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:09,014
rag doll. I one time saw him pull a guy
through a drainpipe by his lips.

64
00:04:09,815 --> 00:04:12,017
Oh, that's horrible.

65
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,520
Who did you get it on film?

66
00:04:15,988 --> 00:04:18,190
What about you? Read Here's fairly liquid.

67
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:20,259
Well, a lot of time.

68
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:24,597
Yeah, but you know, my mom said he once
said, Never lend money to a friend.

69
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,065
You lose both. Oh, no

70
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,566
Problem. I'm not your friend.

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,701
I don't even like you.

72
00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:31,337
Oh, that's tempting. No.

73
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:35,474
But I mean, to lend you money, I have to go
borrow the money first and to clear that with

74
00:04:35,474 --> 00:04:39,778
the wife. And then it would be the name
calling and sleeping in the garage and the

75
00:04:39,778 --> 00:04:41,380
seven years before celibacy.

76
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,383
And I just don't think I could make that
work now.

77
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,718
Yeah, thanks. Anyway, right?

78
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:48,220
Hey, hey, this is great.

79
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,256
Here comes Hellman, because you could ask
him for the money.

80
00:04:50,322 --> 00:04:51,824
How much? All sorts of money.

81
00:04:51,857 --> 00:04:52,958
It's this.

82
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:56,362
It's great. Hey, Helmut, this is perfect
because Doc got something he wants to talk to

83
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:57,696
you about. Oh, yeah, yeah.

84
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,231
Does he have my five hundred bucks yet?

85
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:02,601
Oh oh no.

86
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:07,506
Not what was he here?

87
00:05:07,673 --> 00:05:08,540
You know? Yeah.

88
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,944
Does he have my money? Gave him four hundred.

89
00:05:11,977 --> 00:05:13,345
He said he'd give me five.

90
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:13,746
You know, you

91
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:14,913
Know where he's gone, he's gone.

92
00:05:14,913 --> 00:05:16,282
How he went to get the money?

93
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:19,785
Yeah, because he mentioned to me that he was
like, You know that close to striking a

94
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:20,452
stockbroker?

95
00:05:20,452 --> 00:05:24,456
Well, you tell him I'd like to see him and
he'd better come bearing gifts.

96
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,692
Will sharpen my tools.

97
00:05:26,925 --> 00:05:28,627
All good choice helmet.

98
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:30,229
That's great. I'll mention that to him.

99
00:05:30,262 --> 00:05:34,566
If I see him about you and the, you know,
the sharpened tool thing, that's who you're

100
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:35,634
going to get on with that one.

101
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:38,771
I am so glad the helmet doesn't work for the
home shopping network.

102
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:42,141
And.

103
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:53,352
It does a man get to stop and look around at
the trees and the sky and the water and the

104
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:58,490
ground, the bees on the land and the birds
in the air.

105
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:03,295
It's going to take a long time for us to
wreck this, but we're getting there.

106
00:06:13,405 --> 00:06:18,243
This week on my corner, I'm going to show
you how you could make some furniture.

107
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:23,815
We need some chairs here up the lodge
because some of our old furniture is really

108
00:06:23,815 --> 00:06:26,251
killing us insurance. You know, we've got a
recliner rocker here.

109
00:06:26,251 --> 00:06:31,023
That's just unbelievable. But rather than
switch to the no fault system, what we

110
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,791
thought we'd do is is buy a couple of
chairs.

111
00:06:33,091 --> 00:06:34,359
Well, I went looked at them.

112
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,494
Some of them are upwards.

113
00:06:35,494 --> 00:06:37,262
Nineteen, ninety five, twenty bucks even.

114
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:39,698
That's what we pay for cars, you know?

115
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:44,736
So I thought, Well, heck, let's make our
chairs, you know, and to do that, all we

116
00:06:44,736 --> 00:06:45,837
would need is a lathe.

117
00:06:45,871 --> 00:06:49,975
Now L.A. is going to cost you six or seven
hundred bucks, which we could get, say, a bus

118
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:51,076
or a motor home for.

119
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:54,046
So instead of that, I'm to show you how you
can make your own lathe.

120
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,714
All you need is a drill.

121
00:06:55,714 --> 00:06:56,848
Take your power drill.

122
00:06:56,848 --> 00:06:58,050
Stick it into a vise.

123
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,252
It's going to save you a heck of a lot of
money, believe me.

124
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,087
Ok, so maybe you don't have a vice, huh?

125
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,522
Or maybe you don't even have a drill.

126
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:06,358
So you're saying, Well, how much is this
going to save me, you know?

127
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:08,860
Well, I'll tell you what, Ali.

128
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,230
There's a lot cheaper than advice on the
real put together.

129
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:14,099
Plus, with a drill, look at all the things
you can do with it.

130
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:15,901
You can you can drill or you can.

131
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:16,902
You can screw. You can.

132
00:07:16,902 --> 00:07:18,570
You can mix your computer or you can sand.

133
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,940
You can grind. You can just take a Sunday
morning and just sit at home spinning things

134
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,010
around. While the families of church where
it's a little late.

135
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,647
All you can do is low, you know, except I
guess you can stand on it as a platform when

136
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:30,816
you're painting the ceiling. So you put this
in pretty good here.

137
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,319
Oh oh, and I may have.

138
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:41,059
Ok, OK. But L.A.

139
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:43,662
is still going to cost you more than, say, a
vice and two drills.

140
00:07:46,498 --> 00:07:51,103
Take this out quickly before Louise Thompson
notices that his drill is missing, OK, now in

141
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:53,138
would. We're going to do our leaning on.

142
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:55,207
This is a beautiful piece of teak.

143
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,442
We're going to make a teak chair. This is
going to be one of the legs.

144
00:07:57,943 --> 00:08:03,348
So when I got to do is just put a nail on
the top there to hold her and a hammer.

145
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:06,318
Wow. Wow. She was a bit of that old drill.

146
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:12,591
Like I told you, Bill is a very versatile
tool.

147
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,025
Oh yeah.

148
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:32,577
All right, Ali, put this into our drill, or
should I say our leave picking that up?

149
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:39,251
Oh, you see how you getting a feel for this
now and now?

150
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:44,089
I just need the Chuck T. I go through chuck
keys like pencils and hammers.

151
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,725
Unbelievable. I buy them by the gross.

152
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:50,061
You know this here last me about three
months.

153
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:56,801
Okay, all right now for our speed control.

154
00:08:57,135 --> 00:09:00,605
I got this. I'm going to put that in the
pocket for speed control.

155
00:09:00,905 --> 00:09:03,008
I got this thing off my wife's sewing
machine.

156
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:08,780
Everything used. And now this will turn our
drill into a not only a lathe, but a variable

157
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,850
speed lathe. So but the real end of the
pedal and I plug the pedal up.

158
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:20,692
Yeah. And OK, so we take this metal bracket
and I put a nail in this end of the wood now,

159
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:25,697
and we just line that up there, fit that
through there, and that'll hold her steady.

160
00:09:25,997 --> 00:09:28,366
Now we want that bracket held on to the
bench.

161
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:35,340
So just use my power screwdriver here and
you want it really horse this down good

162
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,477
because you don't want this thing coming off
at three thousand rpm going through your

163
00:09:39,477 --> 00:09:41,846
skull. No chair is worth that.

164
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,449
I mess it with. No, no, not even then.

165
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:50,221
Ok, that's good, that's good.

166
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:53,091
Now just check this out around here.

167
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,126
Taking that up, good.

168
00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:58,530
Is that chuck key?

169
00:09:59,898 --> 00:10:00,698
Hmm.

170
00:10:01,432 --> 00:10:03,801
Oh oh yeah.

171
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:05,570
Yeah, yeah. We'll put that in there.

172
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:12,677
All right. Oh, all right.

173
00:10:13,011 --> 00:10:16,781
Hello. And just one last thing just to
comment on an eye protection.

174
00:10:16,814 --> 00:10:19,017
You know, you only have two eyes.

175
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,519
Take care of them. Ok.

176
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,156
Ready to go. So let's make some fine
furniture.

177
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:45,443
And. All right.

178
00:10:45,643 --> 00:10:51,816
All right, so that we would we would carve
that down while I was spending next time and

179
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:56,821
then you'd make three more just like it and
then another time, maybe next week or

180
00:10:56,821 --> 00:11:03,661
whatever we'll do, we'll make ourselves the
seat for this thing anyway.

181
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:09,067
Until next time, remember the women don't
find the handsome.

182
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,435
They should at least find a handy.

183
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,522
It is spring baseball season.

184
00:11:32,056 --> 00:11:36,594
Your son is pitching the game is called on
account of darkness in the first inning after

185
00:11:36,594 --> 00:11:41,999
your boy walked thirty seven consecutive
batters, but he was pleased his first no

186
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:51,909
hitter. Well, Doc has hit on just

187
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:55,980
about everybody here looking for money while
he's all the time trying to hide from

188
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:01,319
Helmand. In fact, even disguised himself as
a shrub, which was an unfortunate choice for

189
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:05,356
the dog days of summer and after that, this
plane disappeared.

190
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:09,627
But he told me that if he could afford it,
he'd have a complete facial reconstruction

191
00:12:09,627 --> 00:12:11,562
and even a even a sex change operation.

192
00:12:11,963 --> 00:12:15,433
I figure if Helmand gets his hands on them,
he'll get both of those for free.

193
00:12:16,634 --> 00:12:18,869
So Helmand, what's his pound of flesh?

194
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:20,137
Does he know?

195
00:12:20,137 --> 00:12:21,839
I think he just wants to pound doc's flesh.

196
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:24,942
No, no. I'll go read the pound of flesh

197
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:26,877
From the Merchant of Venice.

198
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:29,347
Shylock wanted his pound of flesh.

199
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:31,349
So he took her arms.

200
00:12:31,782 --> 00:12:36,854
Oh no, see his daughter dressed up as a
lawyer and had the case thrown out based on

201
00:12:36,854 --> 00:12:40,224
the fact that in the 15th century they
didn't have the proper equipment for weighing

202
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:40,625
meet.

203
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:44,362
English teachers have the highest suicide
rate on the Herald

204
00:12:45,763 --> 00:12:48,065
Or a nun so long as those of intellect.

205
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,810
And I did want to talk to, you know, what
this financial problem that Doc Render is

206
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,712
having. No, no, no.

207
00:13:02,213 --> 00:13:04,448
That man is a complete liar and a fraud.

208
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,152
Well, he's also the large doctor, you know,
correction.

209
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,888
He claims to be a doctor.

210
00:13:12,423 --> 00:13:14,525
Yeah, he's got all that doctor and equipment.

211
00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:16,694
He's got some tongue depressors

212
00:13:16,694 --> 00:13:19,630
And red one box of coffee stat..

213
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:24,869
Does not a doctor make, you know, doc render
once took my temperature with an indoor

214
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:25,970
outdoor thermometer.

215
00:13:27,471 --> 00:13:29,006
He told me that was a rectal oral.

216
00:13:31,008 --> 00:13:33,577
So you're saying you don't think he's a
doctor?

217
00:13:34,912 --> 00:13:38,983
Well, if he was, what do you need money now,
if he needs cash?

218
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,117
Well, let him go.

219
00:13:40,117 --> 00:13:42,386
Perform a gallbladder operation on somebody.

220
00:13:42,987 --> 00:13:44,755
What does he need the money for anyway?

221
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:47,024
Well, it depends who you ask.

222
00:13:48,058 --> 00:13:52,930
Some people he tells, he's collecting money
for a polar expedition, and he told Harold

223
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,733
that he needed the money to make an alimony
payment to Madonna.

224
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,937
It's credible and worthwhile as both those
causes sound.

225
00:13:59,937 --> 00:14:01,539
We have no money in the kitty.

226
00:14:03,107 --> 00:14:04,642
Well, that's that's just temporary, isn't it,
Douglas?

227
00:14:04,975 --> 00:14:08,012
I mean, one of the members pay their their
dues next

228
00:14:08,012 --> 00:14:09,413
Same time every month.

229
00:14:09,947 --> 00:14:11,582
Never, in fact.

230
00:14:11,882 --> 00:14:13,450
Render is the worst.

231
00:14:14,285 --> 00:14:18,789
If I enforce the Lodge charter, he hasn't
been a member since nineteen sixty five.

232
00:14:20,057 --> 00:14:21,292
He's not good for it.

233
00:14:21,592 --> 00:14:22,793
He's a bad risk.

234
00:14:24,295 --> 00:14:25,729
He doesn't deserve a red cent.

235
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:27,898
I am not a bank manager, read,

236
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,467
I guess not a lot like my bank manager.

237
00:14:31,101 --> 00:14:33,637
If I'm going to lend him money, where would
it end?

238
00:14:34,638 --> 00:14:38,876
Soon everybody would be bothering me,
bothering me for money that I don't have to

239
00:14:38,876 --> 00:14:41,879
lend if he needs money.

240
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:44,081
He can just go out and earn it.

241
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:48,752
Well, I'd be glad to pay him to come out
here and sweep up and bundle all these

242
00:14:48,752 --> 00:14:49,319
leaves.

243
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:53,957
Well, I could mention that to him, but I
don't think he's going to go for it.

244
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:55,959
You know, doctors kind of like to protect
their hands

245
00:14:57,294 --> 00:15:00,931
While he has to realize, read that money
doesn't grow on trees.

246
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:12,076
Well, when you got through with them anyway,
Bill told me to meet him down at the dock.

247
00:15:13,977 --> 00:15:16,747
True. Yeah, I think that's Bill.

248
00:15:17,981 --> 00:15:22,319
Oh yeah, because he wanted to talk about
various water safety and the life preserver

249
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:26,089
type weapon, so he had to bring it.

250
00:15:26,123 --> 00:15:27,458
Now this is this.

251
00:15:28,725 --> 00:15:30,227
That's a life life preserver.

252
00:15:30,727 --> 00:15:36,733
And you get the ropes there and quite a few
ropes there, I didn't know to me, I guess, I

253
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:39,002
guess that's where they go. Anyway, I figure
you've got to advertise you.

254
00:15:41,738 --> 00:15:45,742
You know, I really wasn't aware of what it
was, but he said to me, if it's not date,

255
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:47,611
it's really not going to do you any good.

256
00:15:48,245 --> 00:15:52,316
So we passed it right down there and now
he's ready to ready to go.

257
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,652
It's like a little munchkin.

258
00:15:57,054 --> 00:15:59,656
It's kind of cute, like a decoy.

259
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,593
And there's is no time for this one.

260
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:06,630
Bill knows all, but I know, OK, you got to
strap the tie at the front there, but I would

261
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:11,234
have thought that I would have thought the
arms had to go through those armholes.

262
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,771
Yeah, yeah, I think they do.

263
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:15,505
They surely

264
00:16:15,505 --> 00:16:16,506
Do. Go on.

265
00:16:17,274 --> 00:16:19,876
Now this this here is a is a boat hook.

266
00:16:19,876 --> 00:16:24,214
And when someone's in drowning away, or you
can just kind of like extending your arm and

267
00:16:24,214 --> 00:16:30,988
they hang on to that. And you know, now
Bill's bill's going to pretend he's drowning

268
00:16:30,988 --> 00:16:34,057
and and and on the boat hook can just just
pull them in.

269
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:37,961
Well, and now he's pretending he's drowning
out.

270
00:16:40,597 --> 00:16:42,399
I think he is. Oh yeah, he must have been.

271
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,801
And now this is this is a life ring.

272
00:16:44,868 --> 00:16:47,671
And I think the key here is check the size
of it before, you

273
00:16:47,704 --> 00:16:51,341
Know, because. Exactly.

274
00:16:51,408 --> 00:16:53,110
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

275
00:16:53,477 --> 00:16:55,112
So they'll got a little smaller one.

276
00:16:55,112 --> 00:16:58,749
And also, he thought he'd widened himself
out a bit when he jumped on to this baby.

277
00:16:58,749 --> 00:17:04,921
And I think that was a mistake, but I think
he got enough pieces left to build a new one.

278
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:13,230
Ok, bill. You know, it's not easy being a
teenager.

279
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,767
All the fears and worries and pressures from
kids to do things that you know you really

280
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:18,802
shouldn't do, you know,

281
00:17:19,436 --> 00:17:20,871
Well, it doesn't concern me all that much.

282
00:17:21,104 --> 00:17:24,774
Well, believe me, there's a lot of pressure
to experiment with illicit pleasures.

283
00:17:24,808 --> 00:17:26,076
You know, they say things like, Oh, go
ahead.

284
00:17:26,443 --> 00:17:28,378
Just try it. Go for it.

285
00:17:29,913 --> 00:17:31,581
You know how drugs will fry your brain?

286
00:17:31,948 --> 00:17:34,050
You can't afford that, right?

287
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:35,785
I was talking about sex.

288
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,420
Carnal knowledge.

289
00:17:37,954 --> 00:17:42,492
All righty rule. Mean there's a lot of
pressure to have sex constantly.

290
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,061
Well, I say give in hell.

291
00:17:45,362 --> 00:17:47,364
No, no. I'm going to wait till I'm married.

292
00:17:47,831 --> 00:17:49,299
Oh yeah. Thank you.

293
00:17:49,699 --> 00:17:51,301
Is married? He's still waiting.

294
00:17:51,902 --> 00:17:55,138
Yeah. See, I figure if I wait till I get
married, then there's better likelihood that

295
00:17:55,138 --> 00:17:56,072
a girl will be involved.

296
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:15,058
Well, at this point, I think is pretty well
exhausted any hope he had of coming up with

297
00:18:15,058 --> 00:18:19,863
the money for Olmert. He did try to take
back the cases of empties that we got stacked

298
00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:26,636
under the porch and and in the kitchen and
in the basement by the wood pile and I guess

299
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,506
almost 90 percent of the boat house and all
the way down the dock.

300
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,742
That time he got all that money of the stake
truck and blew all the tires and bent the

301
00:18:32,742 --> 00:18:38,581
frame. He thought he would go on a lecture
tour, but that didn't sell well because

302
00:18:38,581 --> 00:18:40,750
people don't like, listen to Hezbollah even
for free.

303
00:18:41,618 --> 00:18:43,453
So at this point, I would say Doc is toast.

304
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,156
That's going to make for an interesting
meeting tonight, I'll tell you.

305
00:18:46,156 --> 00:18:48,425
And by interesting, I mean, violent.

306
00:18:49,092 --> 00:18:52,028
Well, D nor borrower nor lender be

307
00:18:53,496 --> 00:18:57,267
From that same book where Skylark Teitelbaum,
somebody in the flesh

308
00:18:58,601 --> 00:19:00,670
Is William Shakespeare, the poet, the
playwright.

309
00:19:01,638 --> 00:19:06,176
You know what he'd say to Doc Render in a
case like this to thine own self be true or

310
00:19:07,377 --> 00:19:10,713
false. It's a meeting time Uncle RAM dime
Tehran time.

311
00:19:11,815 --> 00:19:13,483
Come on, let's go. I'll meet you down there.

312
00:19:13,483 --> 00:19:14,617
Ok? Yeah.

313
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:19,122
All right, Harold. I don't think this is
going to take too long because I'll let the

314
00:19:19,122 --> 00:19:20,723
others drive doc to the hospital.

315
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:23,960
Great. Great. Great.

316
00:19:24,928 --> 00:19:34,470
Yeah, I got

317
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:38,341
it. All right.

318
00:19:39,142 --> 00:19:49,085
Sorry, I can

319
00:19:49,118 --> 00:19:49,652
get me.

320
00:19:53,356 --> 00:19:55,358
The floor recognizes helmet Winter Garden

321
00:19:55,925 --> 00:20:02,198
Doc Render owes me five hundred bucks, and I
would appreciate it if anybody here could

322
00:20:02,198 --> 00:20:03,433
tell me where he is.

323
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:07,003
We made an agreement of an interest rate of
forty eight points, which is better than I

324
00:20:07,003 --> 00:20:09,572
could do with GICS or on the bond market.

325
00:20:10,206 --> 00:20:13,643
But if he tries to stiff me, I'm not going
to reward bad behavior.

326
00:20:13,643 --> 00:20:15,445
First, a rip is yours.

327
00:20:15,611 --> 00:20:17,180
All right. All right. Hold your horses.

328
00:20:17,246 --> 00:20:18,815
I'm here. Sorry, I'm late.

329
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:21,384
Hi, guys. Hi, Helmut.

330
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:23,920
Where's my cash helmet?

331
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,555
Have I got good news for you?

332
00:20:25,988 --> 00:20:27,890
In fact, I got good news for everybody.

333
00:20:28,391 --> 00:20:30,093
What did you bring a lie detector?

334
00:20:31,494 --> 00:20:37,033
Yeah, with the main problem around here is
nobody has any confidence in the other guy.

335
00:20:38,034 --> 00:20:42,238
Well, that's OK. You don't think the king
designed for short Fazul?

336
00:20:42,305 --> 00:20:43,973
Well, that kind of thing stand in his way to
you.

337
00:20:44,907 --> 00:20:46,242
You know who he is. Don't tell me.

338
00:20:46,275 --> 00:20:48,978
Where's my five hundred bucks game?

339
00:20:49,078 --> 00:20:51,547
Pleasantville is the world's richest man.

340
00:20:52,081 --> 00:20:55,384
He makes one hundred and twenty six billion
an hour.

341
00:20:55,751 --> 00:21:01,290
And then there's the guy does well, doctor.

342
00:21:01,424 --> 00:21:04,994
Does any of this going to tie into the real
world at any time in the near future, do you think?

343
00:21:04,994 --> 00:21:06,963
Well, I'll put my new investment scheme.

344
00:21:07,063 --> 00:21:11,701
See, six months ago, I started by borrowing
one hundred dollars from stinky Peterson.

345
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:15,605
Yeah. And then now, the next month, I
borrowed two hundred dollars from Moose

346
00:21:15,605 --> 00:21:18,274
Thompson. Yeah, out of which I paid stinky.

347
00:21:18,274 --> 00:21:19,976
One hundred and fifty dollars.

348
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:23,379
Wait, wait, wait. What happened to the other fifty?

349
00:21:23,613 --> 00:21:26,749
If you're going to start nickle and diming me,
we're gonna lose the whole concept.

350
00:21:27,817 --> 00:21:29,719
Anyway. My plan's been going just great.

351
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:35,658
I keep on attracting new investers and, uh, with each new refinancing, I get closer and closer to the final pay off.

352
00:21:36,292 --> 00:21:40,796
Which is when I go to King Fizzlethorne. Get six trillion dollars.

353
00:21:41,197 --> 00:21:44,900
Which, if oil sheiks like him, well, they spend as a tax write-off.

354
00:21:45,301 --> 00:21:48,638
And what happens to all the profits, Doc?

355
00:21:48,638 --> 00:21:51,140
To be shared equally amongst all the investors.

356
00:21:52,508 --> 00:21:58,614
Now the dividend, however, can not be realized unless I get
another five hundred dollars of new cash to pump into the system.

357
00:21:59,415 --> 00:22:02,451
Or, unless, uh, Helmut there wants to differ his shares.

358
00:22:02,885 --> 00:22:04,920
How would you like to differ your pulse?

359
00:22:05,454 --> 00:22:08,824
You know, Helmut, I, uh, made this for your mother.

360
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,495
It took quite a bit of time, of course.

361
00:22:12,495 --> 00:22:17,733
Time that I could of used to get your money back but, uh.
Well, I felt it was more important.

362
00:22:18,501 --> 00:22:19,802
I think a lot of your mother, Helmut.

363
00:22:20,903 --> 00:22:21,871
Thank you.

364
00:22:22,738 --> 00:22:23,739
She likes these.

365
00:22:24,173 --> 00:22:25,174
She wears them in her hair.

366
00:22:26,776 --> 00:22:28,577
Okay, you got another twenty-four hours.

367
00:22:28,811 --> 00:22:30,146
Well thank you, Helmut!

368
00:22:30,913 --> 00:22:33,449
At least somebody can show a little confidence around here.

369
00:22:34,884 --> 00:22:37,753
Well, if there's no other business, Bill.
No.

370
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,056
Well then I call on Douglas here  for a little entertainment.

371
00:22:42,425 --> 00:22:43,559
Good night men, good night men.

372
00:22:43,993 --> 00:22:44,493
Thank you, red.

373
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,028
Keep it hopping. Keep it hopping.

374
00:22:46,028 --> 00:22:46,796
I will. Thank you.

375
00:22:46,796 --> 00:22:48,197
How about a few jokes there, Dougster?

376
00:22:49,365 --> 00:22:53,068
Uh, this was an unfortunate chapter that, uh,
will never be repeated.

377
00:22:53,602 --> 00:22:56,205
And now, boys,I've got something very special for you today.

378
00:22:56,739 --> 00:22:58,507
How to clean your fingernails.

379
00:22:58,941 --> 00:23:01,544
Well, hopefully, Doc has learned his lesson.

380
00:23:02,211 --> 00:23:05,881
You know, for a guy who needs money all the time,
you'd think he might hang out with some people who have some.

381
00:23:07,383 --> 00:23:11,053
I don't know why, uh, Doc chooses to spend time with us
rather than the rich and famous.

382
00:23:11,954 --> 00:23:14,823
Or maybe the rich and famous have kind of told him,
"this is the way it's got to be."

383
00:23:15,591 --> 00:23:18,961
Anyway, uh, if my wife is watching, I'll be coming straight
home after the meeting,

384
00:23:18,961 --> 00:23:24,199
and I - I'm bringing Doc, so, uh, would you leave $500 in small
bills on the kitchen table?

385
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,468
Now, now, now, it's - it's - it's not a loan.

386
00:23:26,468 --> 00:23:27,403
It's an investment.

387
00:23:28,404 --> 00:23:34,877
So, until next time, on behalf of myself and harold and the whole gang up here at possum lodge, keep your stick on the ice.
