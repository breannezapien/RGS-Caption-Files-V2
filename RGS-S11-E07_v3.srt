1
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:04,938
AND MAKE IT BETTER.

2
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:06,573
AND BELIEVE ME,
THAT'S A RARE THING

3
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:09,142
FOR A MIDDLE-AGED, MARRIED
PERSON TO BE ABLE
TO PULL OFF.

4
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:10,944
BUT I THINK
I'VE DONE IT HERE.

5
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:12,679
I'VE TAKEN THIS
WINDSHIELD WIPER

6
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,481
AND MOUNTED IT
ON A SUCTION CUP.

7
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,316
I'VE GOT A LEAD SINKER
ATTACHED TO THE END,

8
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,551
USING THE HANDYMAN'S
SECRET WEAPON.

9
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:20,553
NOW, WE ALL HAVE
WIPERS ON THE FRONT

10
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,288
TO KEEP THE
WINDSHIELD CLEAR.

11
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:25,425
BUT WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER
IF YOU COULD SEE OUT
ALL YOUR WINDOWS?

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,196
NOW, YOU MOUNT THESE BABIES
ON EACH OF THE WINDOWS.

13
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,232
THEY SWING UP
ON THE SUCTION CUP,

14
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:34,667
AND THEN THE LEAD SINKER
BRINGS THEM BACK DOWN.

15
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:37,137
NOW ALL WE NEED IS SOMETHING
THAT WILL MAKE THEM MOVE.

16
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,105
I KNOW, YOU'VE ALREADY
GUESSED IT, HAVEN'T YOU?

17
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:42,542
THAT'S RIGHT,
A MODEL TRAIN.

18
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,378
I STUCK AN OLD ICE SCRAPER
ACROSS THE COW-CATCHER HERE

19
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,147
AND THAT'LL KNOCK
THE WIPER HANDLES

20
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:50,083
EVERY TIME OL' 49 HERE
GOES RUMBLIN' BY.

21
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,953
I ALSO HAVE COMPLETE
CONTROL OVER THE SPEED

22
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,991
OF MY AUXILIARY WIPER SYSTEM
WITH THIS TRAIN TRANSFORMER.

23
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,527
I CAN SET HER
FROM SHUNTING SPEED

24
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:02,729
ALL THE WAY
TO FULL SPEED AHEAD.

25
00:01:02,795 --> 00:01:04,797
AND I'M RUNNING THE WHOLE
DEAL OFF THE CAR BATTERY,

26
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:06,966
GOT IT HOOKED UP TO THE
CIGARETTE LIGHTER HERE.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,968
I CAN EVEN DO THIS.

28
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:12,538
THAT'S MY INTERMITTENT.

29
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,440
OKAY, I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR MY DEMONSTRATION,

30
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,309
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO USE YOUR IMAGINATIONS

31
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:17,810
A FAIR BIT HERE.

32
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:20,546
PRETEND I'M ON THE HIGHWAY.
PRETEND IT'S RAINING.

33
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,081
AND PRETEND
THIS ACTUALLY WORKS.

34
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:34,160
[applause]

35
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:42,135
[cheering and applause]

36
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,708
ALL RIGHT.

37
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,311
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.

38
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,647
I APPRECIATE THAT.

39
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,949
GOT A BIT OF A PROJECT GOING
ON UP AT THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

40
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:58,785
HAROLD WANTS US TO GET
RID OF ALL THE JUNK

41
00:01:58,851 --> 00:02:00,053
THAT'S LYING AROUND HERE.

42
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,255
BUT I SAY, NO, WE JUST
NEED ANOTHER SHED.

43
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:04,757
USUALLY WE JUST
MAKE OUR OWN SHEDS.

44
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:06,993
WE JUST STAND
A BUNCH OF CANOES UP,

45
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,628
DUCT TAPE THEM TOGETHER.

46
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,797
AND I WANT TO BUY ONE OF
THOSE FANCY STEEL SHEDS

47
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,565
THEY GOT ON SALE DOWN
AT THE LUMBER YARD.

48
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,634
NOW ALL WE GOTTA DO IS FIND A
WAY TO RAISE THE CASH.

49
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,202
YOU KNOW, IF THOSE PEOPLE
WOULD TAKE A CHEQUE,

50
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:18,704
NONE OF THIS
WOULD BE NECESSARY.

51
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:21,474
RED, RED, I THINK
I GOT THE ANSWER.

52
00:02:21,507 --> 00:02:23,409
YOU REMEMBER ALL THOSE CANS OF
FOOD WE PUT IN THE BASEMENT

53
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,144
FOR THAT Y2K SCARE?

54
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:26,546
YEAH.
OH, REMEMBER THAT, EH?

55
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,281
THE SKY IS FALLING.

56
00:02:28,347 --> 00:02:29,982
OKAY, WELL YOU KNOW,

57
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:31,651
WE COULD SELL THESE
FOR SOME MONEY.

58
00:02:31,717 --> 00:02:33,920
WE'VE GOT HUNDREDS
OF THESE THINGS.

59
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:36,556
WELL, THEY HAVEN'T GOT
ANY LABELS, DALTON.

60
00:02:36,622 --> 00:02:39,091
OH, ALL RIGHT.
WE HAVE THE LABELS.
NO, NO, NO,

61
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:41,994
WE JUST DON'T KNOW
WHICH CANS THEY CAME OFF.

62
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:45,031
WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT
WOULD CUT INTO THE
SALES POTENTIAL,

63
00:02:45,097 --> 00:02:46,566
I WOULD THINK,
DALTON.

64
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,168
YOU LEAVE THAT TO ME.
IT'S MARKETING, RED.

65
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,304
YOU DON'T KNOW
MUCH ABOUT MARKETING.

66
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,073
WELL, I KNOW A CAN
OF CORN IS $1.69.

67
00:02:54,106 --> 00:02:57,243
IT'S SHINY, AND IT'S
GOT A LABEL ON IT.

68
00:02:57,276 --> 00:03:00,846
SO HOW MUCH WOULD I
PAY FOR A RUSTY CAN
OF WHO KNOWS WHAT?

69
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,183
YOU KNOW A PENNY
SOUNDS HIGH TO ME.

70
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,252
WELL, THAT'S THE THING.
YOU DON'T SELL THE STEAK.

71
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:09,088
YOU SELL THE SIZZLE.

72
00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:12,191
STEAK AND SIZZLE
COME IN CANS, DO THEY?

73
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,560
RED,
IT'S A METAPHOR.

74
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:17,496
WE'RE GOING TO SELL THESE
GRAB-BAG SURPRISE PACKAGES.

75
00:03:17,563 --> 00:03:19,432
IT'S A LOTTERY, HUH!

76
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:21,267
OH, SO YOU BUY A CAN.

77
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,702
YOU'RE KIND OF HOPING
THAT IT'S PEAS,

78
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:25,171
BUT IF YOU'RE LUCKY,
IT MIGHT EVEN BE CARROTS.

79
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:27,139
CAVIAR, RED.
IS THAT IT?

80
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,041
IT COULD BE CAVIAR.

81
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,443
NO, NO, DALTON.
HANG ON A SECOND.

82
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:32,311
IF YOU'RE GOING TO ADD
A CAN OF CAVIAR
INTO THE MIX,

83
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,413
THAT'S GOING TO COST
YOU AN EXTRA 300 BUCKS.

84
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,050
YOU SEE, I DON'T HAVE
TO PROVIDE CAVIAR, RED.

85
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:42,088
I HAVE TO PROVIDE THE
POSSIBILITY OF CAVIAR.

86
00:03:42,154 --> 00:03:44,857
[laughing maniacally]

87
00:03:45,157 --> 00:03:47,860
YOU KNOW, I THINK
HE'S LOOKING AT THE
POSSIBILITY OF JAIL TIME.

88
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:58,571
IT'S TIME FOR THE
POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

89
00:03:58,637 --> 00:04:01,273
[cheering and applause]

90
00:04:07,446 --> 00:04:10,549
AND TODAY'S WINNER WILL
RECEIVE ONE FREE SHOE SHINE.

91
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:13,652
YOUR CHOICE, ONE RIGHT SHOE
OR ONE LEFT SHOE.

92
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,121
CLOSE YOUR EARS, HAROLD.

93
00:04:15,187 --> 00:04:17,056
OKAY, RED, YOU'VE GOT
30 SECONDS

94
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,557
TO GET HAROLD TO SAY
THIS WORD...

95
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:23,262
YEAH,
ALL RIGHT, DALTON.

96
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,497
AND GO!

97
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,800
OKAY, HAROLD,
THIS IS SOMETHING
ALL MEN LIKE TO HAVE.

98
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,602
EXCUSES.

99
00:04:29,635 --> 00:04:31,770
NO, UM, THIS IS
A PHYSICAL THING.

100
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,772
IF YOU LOOKED AT THE ARMS
OF MOST OF THE GUYS
AT THE LODGE,

101
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,940
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

102
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:35,975
TATTOOS.
SCARS.

103
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:37,476
BURNT HAIR.
BURNT HAIR!

104
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,844
NO. NO. NO.
RING IT!

105
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:41,013
THIS IS A
BODY PART, OKAY?

106
00:04:41,046 --> 00:04:43,048
AND MOOSE THOMPSON
HAS REAL BIG ONES.

107
00:04:55,527 --> 00:04:59,265
I'M NOT ALLOWED IN
THE COMMUNAL SHOWER.
I DON'T KNOW.

108
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:01,233
YEAH, OKAY.
TIME'S ALMOST UP, RED.

109
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,901
YOU KNOW, UH,
HAROLD,

110
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,737
IF WOMEN SEE
A REAL GOOD LOOKING MAN

111
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,372
THEY'LL SAY, "BOY, I'D
REALLY LIKE TO SEE HIS..."

112
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:08,140
PORTFOLIO.

113
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:12,011
REMEMBER WE WENT TO THE
STEAKHOUSE LAST WEEK?

114
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:14,380
AND TO GET YOUR KNIFE THROUGH
THE BEEF YOU HAD TO
USE ALL YOUR...

115
00:05:14,446 --> 00:05:16,015
I DON'T EAT RED MEAT.
I HAD THE MUSSELS.

116
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:17,516
THAT'S IT!
THAT'S IT!

117
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:20,285
[applause]

118
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:29,361
SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY
LIKES TO LOOK WEALTHY.

119
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,264
SOME GUYS DO IT WITH CLOTHES
OR CARS OR JEWELLERY.

120
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:34,233
SOME GUYS
DO IT WITH WIVES.

121
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:36,335
SOME GUYS
DO IT WITH EMPTIES.

122
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,270
TO ME, THERE'S NOTHING
THAT SAYS MONEY

123
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:40,806
MORE THAN HAVING
A RIDING LAWN MOWER.

124
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:42,775
SO THIS TIME,
ON HANDYMAN CORNER,

125
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:44,710
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU
HOW YOU CAN BUILD
YOUR OWN STYLISH,

126
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:47,413
AND YET EXTREMELY
AFFORDABLE, RIDING MOWER.

127
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:49,515
OKAY, ALL YOU NEED
IS AN EAVESTROUGH,

128
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:51,250
A CHUNK OF TWO-BY-SIX,

129
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:53,285
A GAS PUSH MOWER,

130
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:54,720
A GARAGE DOOR OPENER,

131
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,488
AND, OF COURSE,
A TOILET PLUNGER.

132
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,260
STEP ONE, YOU WANT TO PUT
AN EXTRA HANDLE ON
YOUR MOWER THERE

133
00:06:01,293 --> 00:06:03,262
SO YOU CAN
SWING BOTH WAYS.

134
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:06,632
THEN YOU RUN YOUR TWO-BY-SIX
RIGHT THROUGH THE TWO OF THEM.

135
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:09,434
THAT BECOMES THE
MOUNTING PLATFORM FOR
YOUR PULLING MECHANISM.

136
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:12,538
IT ALSO DOUBLES
AS A SEAT.

137
00:06:12,571 --> 00:06:14,773
I WOULD SAY
DON'T EVEN SAND THAT.

138
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,475
SLIVERS MAY HURT A LITTLE,

139
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,243
BUT THEY SURE KEEP YOU
FROM SLIDING OFF.

140
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,812
ALL RIGHT, THE NEXT THING
YOU WANT TO DO IS

141
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:21,880
TAKE YOUR GARAGE DOOR OPENER
AND YOUR EAVESTROUGH

142
00:06:21,947 --> 00:06:24,716
AND MOUNT THEM DEAD
CENTRE ON THE TWO-BY-SIX.

143
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,618
NO, LET ME REPHRASE THAT.

144
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,554
THE INSURANCE COMPANY
DOESN'T LIKE TO HEAR THINGS

145
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,455
LIKE DEAD CENTRE,

146
00:06:30,522 --> 00:06:32,624
OR BLEED THE LINES,

147
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:34,493
OR I'M GONNA USE
THE BIG HAMMER.

148
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,234
YOU KNOW, EVERY LAWNG MOWER
HAS A LITTLE GENERATOR IN IT

149
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:44,503
TO MAKE THE
SPARK PLUG GO.

150
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:45,771
SO I'M USING SOME
OF THAT ELECTRICITY

151
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:47,673
TO RUN MY
GARAGE DOOR OPENER.

152
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:49,575
PROBABLY NOT EXACTLY
THE RIGHT VOLTAGE,

153
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:51,176
BUT I FIND
WITH ELECTRICITY,

154
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:53,712
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE ALL THAT CLOSE.

155
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:55,647
NOW, WHEN YOU MOUNT YOUR
GARAGE DOOR OPENER ON THERE,

156
00:06:55,714 --> 00:06:58,951
MAKE SURE YOU DO IT
WITH JUST ONE BOLT.

157
00:06:58,984 --> 00:07:00,919
THAT WAY IT
CAN SWING AROUND.

158
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:03,055
I'LL SHOW
YOU WHY LATER.

159
00:07:03,088 --> 00:07:05,557
OKAY, NOW GET ALL THE
CABLE OUT OF THE OPENER

160
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,293
AND ATTACH THE END OF IT
TO YOUR TOILET PLUNGER.

161
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,997
NOW ALL YOU NEED IS SOMETHING
TO SHOOT THAT PLUNGER
OUT OF THERE.

162
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:15,133
GOTTA BE SOMETHING STRONG,
BUT STRETCHY.

163
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,668
OH, I KNOW JUST THE --

164
00:07:25,744 --> 00:07:28,413
YEAH, UM, DOCTOR TOLD
ME TO WEAR THESE.

165
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,649
SAID THEY'D
IMPROVE MY CIRCULATION.

166
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:32,651
BOY, WAS HE WRONG.

167
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:35,587
WHEN I HAVE THEM ON, WOMEN
DON'T EVEN WANT TO TALK TO ME.

168
00:07:35,654 --> 00:07:39,624
OKAY, SO I POSITION THE
LAUNCHER INTO MY ROCKET SILO,

169
00:07:39,658 --> 00:07:43,028
AND THEN I DROP MY
ARROW IN THERE,

170
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:45,097
AIM HER ALL UP,

171
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,999
AND WE'RE READY
FOR A DEMONSTRATION.

172
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:50,535
I'LL SHOW YOU
HOW SHE WORKS.

173
00:07:50,602 --> 00:07:54,639
[breathing heavily]

174
00:07:59,744 --> 00:08:02,814
[mower starting]

175
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:06,184
ALL RIGHT, NOW, WE JUST
TAKE OUR PLUNGER

176
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:09,354
AND WE AIM HER
AT SOMETHING SOLID.

177
00:08:09,421 --> 00:08:11,690
LIKE, SAY,
A DOG HOUSE.

178
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:32,344
OKAY, NOW, OF COURSE,

179
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,547
WE WANT TO HEAD BACK
THE OTHER WAY.

180
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,184
SO WE SWING OUR FIRING
DEVICE ALL THE WAY AROUND.

181
00:08:39,217 --> 00:08:41,419
WE AIM AT SOMETHING ELSE.

182
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:46,057
I'M THINKING MAYBE THAT
MAILBOX ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE STREET.

183
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:54,165
[applause]

184
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:03,508
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
OLDER GUYS OUT THERE.

185
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,410
YOU KNOW, AS WE AGE,

186
00:09:05,477 --> 00:09:08,013
THE LINE BETWEEN "WITH IT,
MIDDLE-AGED GUY,"

187
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:10,348
AND "OUT-OF-IT,
HOPELESS GEEZER"

188
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:12,851
STARTS TO BLUR.

189
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:15,353
NOW, I KNOW THERE'S NO WAY
THAT YOU'RE A GEEZER,

190
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:17,055
BUT MAYBE SOME
OF YOUR FRIENDS

191
00:09:17,088 --> 00:09:19,124
ARE STARTING TO
SHOW THE TELLTALE SIGNS,

192
00:09:19,157 --> 00:09:21,026
START SAYING THINGS LIKE,

193
00:09:21,092 --> 00:09:24,129
"I REMEMBER WHEN THEY'D
DELIVER THAT WITH A HORSE."

194
00:09:24,162 --> 00:09:27,532
OR, "I SEE BELL BOTTOMS ARE
COMING BACK IN STYLE."

195
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:31,035
OR, "COMPUTERS MAKE
YOUR BRAIN GO SOFT."

196
00:09:31,102 --> 00:09:33,037
ACTUALLY, COMPUTERS DO
MAKE YOUR BRAIN GO SOFT,

197
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:35,874
BUT IT TAKES A GEEZER
TO NOTICE IT.

198
00:09:35,907 --> 00:09:38,176
NOT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING
WRONG WITH BEING A GEEZER.

199
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:39,911
I MEAN, SOME OF THE
BEST LAWN ORNAMENTS

200
00:09:39,944 --> 00:09:44,516
AND CLOTHES PEG RECIPE CARD
HOLDERS ARE MADE BY GEEZERS.

201
00:09:44,582 --> 00:09:46,985
BUT I'M JUST THINKING YOU'RE
NOT QUITE READY TO
JOIN THE CLUB

202
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:50,622
WHERE THE DUES ARE PAID
IN BALLS OF OLD STRING.

203
00:09:50,688 --> 00:09:53,825
NO, SIR, YOU'VE GOT YEARS
IN THE FAST LANE AHEAD OF YOU

204
00:09:53,858 --> 00:09:56,828
BEFORE YOU PULL OFF
ON THE EXIT TO GEEZERDOM.

205
00:09:56,895 --> 00:10:00,231
BUT WHAT DO YOU DO IF SOME OF
YOUR FRIENDS AREN'T SO LUCKY?

206
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:02,500
WELL, YOU DO EVERYTHING YOU
CAN TO MAKE THEM FEEL

207
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:04,569
LIKE THEY'RE STILL HIP
AND HAPPENING.

208
00:10:04,602 --> 00:10:07,305
IF YOU SEE THEM HEADING OFF
TO THE MALL IN THEIR
BEDROOM SLIPPERS,

209
00:10:07,338 --> 00:10:09,607
YOU DO THE SAME THING.

210
00:10:09,674 --> 00:10:11,676
JUST SO THEY WON'T
FEEL OUT OF PLACE.

211
00:10:11,743 --> 00:10:14,679
IF THEY SHOW YOU THEIR
COLLECTION OF HOTEL SOAPS,

212
00:10:14,712 --> 00:10:17,549
YOU'VE GOT TO ADMIRE IT
AND SHOW THEM YOURS.

213
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:21,286
AND NEVER EVER TELL THEM
THEY'VE BECOME A GEEZER.

214
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:23,655
THEY MIGHT DO THE SAME
FOR YOU SOME DAY.

215
00:10:23,688 --> 00:10:26,758
MAYBE THEY ALREADY HAVE.

216
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,626
REMEMBER,
I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

217
00:10:28,693 --> 00:10:30,194
WE'RE ALL
IN THIS TOGETHER.

218
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:40,171
OKAY, MIKE.
I'M HERE. NOW WHAT?

219
00:10:40,238 --> 00:10:43,241
RED, YOU GOT TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO GET ME OUT OF HERE.

220
00:10:43,274 --> 00:10:46,711
RED: I assume coming out
the front door is out
of the question.

221
00:10:46,744 --> 00:10:48,646
THAT'S VERY ASTUTE OF YOU.

222
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,015
RED: Mike, how do you get
yourself into these shamozles?

223
00:10:51,082 --> 00:10:53,017
SHE SAID HER DAD WOULD
BE AWAY ALL WEEKEND

224
00:10:53,084 --> 00:10:55,219
AND HE WASN'T COMING
HOME UNTIL MONDAY.

225
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:58,222
AND GET THIS,
HE'S MY PAROLE OFFICER.

226
00:10:58,256 --> 00:10:59,957
Small world, isn't it?

227
00:11:00,024 --> 00:11:03,361
YEAH, SMALL WORLD,
SMALL JAIL CELL.

228
00:11:03,394 --> 00:11:05,663
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S
WHERE YOU COME IN.

229
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,132
GO TO THE FRONT DOOR
AND START TALKING TO HIM.

230
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:10,068
AND THAT'LL GIVE ME THE CHANCE
TO SNEAK OUT THE BACK WAY.

231
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:12,003
AND I'LL MEET YOU
BACK IN THE POSSUM VAN.

232
00:11:12,036 --> 00:11:14,105
OKAY.

233
00:11:14,138 --> 00:11:16,708
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO TELL HIM?

234
00:11:16,774 --> 00:11:19,644
SAY THAT I SENT YOU WITH
A MESSAGE FOR HIS DAUGHTER,

235
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:21,913
THAT I KNEW SHE WANTED
TO GO OUT WITH ME TONIGHT,

236
00:11:21,979 --> 00:11:23,815
BUT I DIDN'T
THINK IT WAS RIGHT,

237
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:26,818
so i stayed
home to read my Bible.

238
00:11:26,884 --> 00:11:28,386
YOU EXPECT HIM
TO BELIEVE THAT?

239
00:11:28,453 --> 00:11:30,088
WELL, IT'S
BEEN MY EXPERIENCE

240
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:32,590
THAT PAROLE OFFICERS WILL
BELIEVE PRETTY WELL ANYTHING.

241
00:11:32,623 --> 00:11:33,724
RED: Okay.

242
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:37,528
[knocking]

243
00:11:39,297 --> 00:11:41,399
YEAH, I GOT A MESSAGE
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER.

244
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:42,967
SHE WANTED TO
GO OUT WITH MIKE,

245
00:11:43,034 --> 00:11:44,368
BUT HE'S NOT GOING
TO BE COMING.

246
00:11:44,402 --> 00:11:46,070
HE'S STAYING HOME READING
THE OLD TESTAMENT.

247
00:11:46,137 --> 00:11:48,005
SO HE WON'T BE
DROPPING AROUND.

248
00:11:48,072 --> 00:11:49,507
JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW THAT.

249
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:51,008
OKAY, FINE.
GOOD NIGHT.

250
00:11:51,075 --> 00:11:52,443
AND DON'T FORGET
TO WEAR YOUR SEATBELT.

251
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:02,954
MIKE, ARE YOU IN HERE?

252
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,655
HOW'D IT GO?

253
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:06,390
OH, FINE.
GOOD.

254
00:12:06,457 --> 00:12:08,292
HE'S NOT CONCERNED
ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER.

255
00:12:08,326 --> 00:12:10,394
HE'S WONDERING WHAT
HAPPENED TO HIS
TELEVISION SET.

256
00:12:10,461 --> 00:12:11,896
OH.

257
00:12:21,572 --> 00:12:23,241
JUDGING BY THE INVENTORY,

258
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:25,009
I'D SAY WE MAY HAVE
OVERESTIMATED

259
00:12:25,076 --> 00:12:28,412
CONSUMER DEMAND FOR
UNMARKED, RUSTY FOOD CANS.

260
00:12:29,947 --> 00:12:31,983
I THINK WE HAVE PROBLEM.

261
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:34,251
OH, YEAH,
MR. MARKETING GENIUS?

262
00:12:34,285 --> 00:12:36,320
DID YOUR SIZZLE
KIND OF FIZZLE?

263
00:12:36,354 --> 00:12:39,290
THE IGNORANCE OF THE
PEOPLE IN THIS COMMUNITY

264
00:12:39,357 --> 00:12:41,626
CAN JUST BE EXTREMELY
FRUSTRATING.

265
00:12:41,692 --> 00:12:43,327
ARE YOU SAYING
THEY DIDN'T GET EXCITED

266
00:12:43,394 --> 00:12:45,062
ABOUT THE CHANCE
TO BUY CHEAP CAVIAR?

267
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:47,498
THEY DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT CAVIAR WAS.

268
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:49,300
WELL, DID YOU TELL THEM
IT WAS FISH EGGS

269
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,469
YES.
IN A BLACK, GOOEY SAUCE?

270
00:12:51,535 --> 00:12:53,170
NOTHING.
AND?

271
00:12:53,237 --> 00:12:54,839
NO.
NO KIDDING?

272
00:12:54,905 --> 00:12:56,540
I'VE GOT
A BETTER IDEA.

273
00:12:56,574 --> 00:12:58,609
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
A POT-LUCK SUPPER DOWN
AT THE COMMUNITY CENTRE.

274
00:12:58,642 --> 00:13:00,544
WE'RE GOING TO PUT ALL
THE CANS IN A BIG CAULDRON.

275
00:13:00,578 --> 00:13:02,079
WE'RE GOING TO CALL IT
POSSUM LODGE STEW.

276
00:13:02,146 --> 00:13:04,081
CHARGE FIVE BUCKS A BOWL.

277
00:13:04,148 --> 00:13:06,984
HOW MUCH FOR THE ANTIDOTE?

278
00:13:07,017 --> 00:13:08,586
NO, I THINK IT MIGHT
WORK, YOU KNOW?

279
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:12,490
FOR ANY EX-CON THAT WOULD
BE LIKE A STROLL DOWN
MEMORY LANE.

280
00:13:12,556 --> 00:13:14,392
YEAH, IT'S FIVE BUCKS.
IT'S ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT.

281
00:13:14,425 --> 00:13:15,893
IT'S A BARGAIN!

282
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,062
FOR ME, I COULDN'T
EAT 50 CENTS WORTH.

283
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:19,897
YOU KNOW WE'RE
GOING TO MAKE IT A FUN NIGHT.

284
00:13:19,964 --> 00:13:21,832
WE'RE GOING TO OPEN
A THOUSAND CANS OF FOOD.

285
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:23,467
LET THE CHIPS
FALL WHERE THEY MAY,

286
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:25,603
AND WE'RE GOING
TO CALL IT...

287
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:27,805
THE NIGHT OF
A THOUSAND CANS!

288
00:13:27,872 --> 00:13:31,075
YOU KNOW,
NIGHT OF A THOUSAND
CRAMPS MIGHT WORK BETTER.

289
00:13:36,914 --> 00:13:38,716
Red: A BUNCH OF US WERE
TAKING DOWN A PUP TENT

290
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:40,918
BEHIND THE LODGE THERE.

291
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:42,486
WE'D DONE OUR BIT.

292
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,922
KIND OF LEFT WALTER TO
CLEAN IT UP, FINALLY.

293
00:13:44,955 --> 00:13:46,624
ODD THING HAPPENED.

294
00:13:46,657 --> 00:13:48,125
WE HAD A KIND OF
A LOW BREEZE COME IN.

295
00:13:48,192 --> 00:13:50,027
I BELIEVE IT'S CALLED
A RISING THERMAL,

296
00:13:50,094 --> 00:13:53,264
AND, UH, IT TOOK WALTER UP
600 OR 700 FEET, I BELIEVE.

297
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:56,934
YOU CAN'T COUNT ON THERMALS,
AS MOST OF US KNOW,

298
00:13:57,001 --> 00:14:00,070
BUT THIS GAVE
US A GREAT IDEA.

299
00:14:00,104 --> 00:14:03,274
WE COULD TRY PARASAILING
USING THE PUP TENT.

300
00:14:03,307 --> 00:14:05,409
AND ALL WE NEEDED -- WE
NEEDED SOME KIND OF A VEHICLE

301
00:14:05,442 --> 00:14:07,511
IF WE COULD GET
SOMETHING TO PULL IT.

302
00:14:07,578 --> 00:14:10,381
AND MIKE HAD AN IDEA.
HE HAD JUST THE VEHICLE
IN MIND, APPARENTLY.

303
00:14:10,447 --> 00:14:13,317
SO ALL WE HAD TO DO WAS
TALK WALTER INTO DOING IT.

304
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,985
HE WAS QUITE IMPRESSED
BEING UP THERE,

305
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:17,354
AND WE SAID THAT
WE HAD A GREAT PLAN.

306
00:14:17,388 --> 00:14:19,924
AND, UH, I DIDN'T REALIZE
MIKE HAD A MOTORCYCLE.

307
00:14:19,957 --> 00:14:21,825
I GUESS HE HAD
JUST PICKED THIS ONE UP.

308
00:14:26,063 --> 00:14:28,332
AND, UH, VERY GENEROUS.
HE WAS ALLOWING WINSTON
TO RIDE IT.

309
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,367
HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE
ON IT FOR A WHILE.

310
00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:32,503
SO WINSTON TURNED
HER AROUND,

311
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:35,205
AND ALL WE WERE GOING
TO DO WAS JUST HOOK
WALTER WITH A ROPE.

312
00:14:35,272 --> 00:14:37,141
YOU'RE GOING TO REALLY
ENJOY THIS, WALTER.

313
00:14:37,207 --> 00:14:38,676
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS.

314
00:14:38,742 --> 00:14:40,210
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE.

315
00:14:40,244 --> 00:14:42,346
NOW ALL WE GOT TO DO
IS ATTACH THE OTHER END

316
00:14:42,413 --> 00:14:44,782
TO THE MOTORCYCLE.

317
00:14:44,815 --> 00:14:46,817
THERE WASN'T REALLY ANYTHING
WE FELT WAS STRONG
ENOUGH ON IT,

318
00:14:46,884 --> 00:14:49,253
AND WINSTON GOT THE IDEA
THAT INSTEAD OF TYING
IT TO THE MOTORCYCLE,

319
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:53,791
HE'S ON THERE SO WHY DIDN'T
WE JUST TIE IT AROUND
HIS WAIST?

320
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:58,696
NOW, WE FIGURE, WALTER,
ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS

321
00:14:58,729 --> 00:15:00,164
JUST JUMP.
JUST JUMP.

322
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,466
YOU'LL LOVE THIS.
IT'S LIKE AN AMUSEMENT PARK.

323
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:05,269
AND THEN WE'LL -- MIKE AND I
WILL THROW THE TENT.

324
00:15:05,335 --> 00:15:07,438
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

325
00:15:07,504 --> 00:15:09,039
NOW, DON'T FORGET,
YOU GOTTA JUMP.

326
00:15:09,073 --> 00:15:10,407
TAKE HER.
GO!

327
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:11,809
THERE WE GO!

328
00:15:11,842 --> 00:15:12,976
JUMP.
JUMP, WALTER.

329
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:14,745
UP YOU GO.
UP YOU GO, WALTER.

330
00:15:14,812 --> 00:15:16,547
JUMP. JUMP.
UP YOU GO.

331
00:15:16,613 --> 00:15:18,482
GIVE HER THE GUN
THERE, WINSTON.

332
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:22,019
GIVE HER SOME --
OH! OH! OHH!

333
00:15:22,352 --> 00:15:24,555
ALL RIGHT.
SO WE CHECKED THE MANUAL.

334
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:27,157
AND THAT'S
HOW THEY DO IT.

335
00:15:27,191 --> 00:15:28,826
OH, OKAY.

336
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:31,261
NOW, YOU PUT WALTER RIGHT
ON THE BACK OF THE
MOTORCYCLE,

337
00:15:31,295 --> 00:15:33,197
AND, OF COURSE,
WE'RE UP TO LET --

338
00:15:33,263 --> 00:15:35,132
TO LET THE SAIL
GO FROM THE TOP OF THE VAN,

339
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,600
TO RELEASE THE SAIL.

340
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:38,669
AND UP HE GOES!
AND THAT'S GREAT.

341
00:15:38,735 --> 00:15:41,205
BUT WE FORGOT
WINSTON WAS ATTACHED.

342
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:43,807
WELL, NOW THEY'RE
FLOATING UP THERE.

343
00:15:43,874 --> 00:15:46,043
MIKE BRINGS THE ANCHOR ROPE.
THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA.

344
00:15:46,109 --> 00:15:47,811
ALL WE GOTTA DO
IS ANCHOR THEM.

345
00:15:47,845 --> 00:15:49,479
THAT'S THE
WRONG END, MIKE.

346
00:15:49,546 --> 00:15:51,348
YOU WANT TO THROW
THE ANCHOR UP THERE

347
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:54,251
AND HOOK IT TO SOMEWHERE,
ANYWHERE ON THEM.

348
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:57,087
AND...
GOT 'EM.

349
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,290
AND IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

350
00:16:00,357 --> 00:16:01,625
AND WE SAVED HER AGAIN.
PERFECT.

351
00:16:01,658 --> 00:16:03,493
OOPS.

352
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,430
UMM... UMM...

353
00:16:08,098 --> 00:16:09,900
OKAY, GUYS,
I GOTTA GO.

354
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,277
HEY THERE, GORD.

355
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,312
HANG ON A SECOND.
I'M PICKETING HERE.

356
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:24,481
I'M GORD! I'M BORED!
GET USED TO IT!

357
00:16:28,518 --> 00:16:30,520
WHAT'S GOING
ON HERE, GORD?

358
00:16:30,587 --> 00:16:33,256
I'M ON STRIKE,
RED, OKAY?

359
00:16:33,323 --> 00:16:35,926
YOU KNOW, POWER TO
THE PEOPLE AND ALL THAT.

360
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:37,794
AND WOULDN'T THIS
WORK BETTER

361
00:16:37,828 --> 00:16:40,297
IF YOU WENT DOWN WHERE
PEOPLE COULD ACTUALLY
SEE YOU?

362
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,132
YEAH, PROBABLY.

363
00:16:42,165 --> 00:16:44,801
BUT I COULDN'T BRING
MYSELF TO LEAVE MY POST.

364
00:16:44,835 --> 00:16:47,671
WELL, THIS COULD BE A
FIRST IN ORGANIZED LABOUR.

365
00:16:47,738 --> 00:16:49,940
YOU'RE YOUR OWN SCAB.

366
00:16:50,006 --> 00:16:54,378
[laughter and applause]

367
00:16:56,813 --> 00:16:58,515
LOOK, I'M NEW
AT THIS, OKAY?

368
00:16:58,582 --> 00:17:00,951
HOW COME YOUR
SIGN IS BLANK?

369
00:17:00,984 --> 00:17:04,254
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE TOO
SPECIFIC ABOUT MY DEMANDS.

370
00:17:04,287 --> 00:17:06,957
I JUST WANTED TO SHOW
MY GENERAL DISPLEASURE.

371
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,760
NOW, THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOMETHING THAT'S
BOTHERING YOU.

372
00:17:09,826 --> 00:17:11,428
ARE YOU AFTER A RAISE?

373
00:17:11,495 --> 00:17:13,497
I'D LIKE
TO BE PAID, OKAY?

374
00:17:13,563 --> 00:17:15,432
THEN WE CAN TALK
ABOUT A RAISE.

375
00:17:15,499 --> 00:17:17,367
ARE YOU SAYING YOU
STILL HAVE NEVER BEEN PAID?

376
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,935
NO.

377
00:17:18,969 --> 00:17:21,004
IT'S A BIT
OF A SORE SPOT.

378
00:17:21,071 --> 00:17:23,140
TO SEEM GREEDY.
I DON'T WANT
OKAY, SO --

379
00:17:23,173 --> 00:17:25,142
I UNDERSTAND, BUT
IF YOU COULD GET PAID,

380
00:17:25,175 --> 00:17:26,510
THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD
DO IT FOR YOU?

381
00:17:26,576 --> 00:17:28,011
OH, SURE.

382
00:17:28,044 --> 00:17:29,546
AND A VACATION
WOULD BE NICE.

383
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:31,715
A LITTLE "ME" TIME.

384
00:17:31,748 --> 00:17:34,384
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT'D BE NICE
TO HAVE ST. PATRICK'S DAY OFF.

385
00:17:34,451 --> 00:17:36,520
NO. YOU KNOW, NOBODY
GETS ST. PATRICK'S DAY,

386
00:17:36,586 --> 00:17:38,355
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT I WOULD SAY?

387
00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:40,790
WHY DON'T YOU GET THE
BIG VACATION STRETCH
THAT YOU HAVE NOW,

388
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:43,059
LIKE THE TIME BETWEEN, SAY,
CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR'S?

389
00:17:43,093 --> 00:17:46,129
CHRISTMAS
IS A HOLIDAY?

390
00:17:46,196 --> 00:17:49,399
YOU KNOW, GORD, I THINK
YOU HAVE A DECISION TO MAKE.

391
00:17:49,432 --> 00:17:51,902
I THINK YOU HAVE
TO GET ANOTHER JOB,

392
00:17:51,935 --> 00:17:54,504
OR YOU HAVE TO KEEP GOING THIS
ONE AND NOT GET PAID FOR IT.

393
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:57,040
DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY
ELSE THAT WOULD HIRE YOU?

394
00:17:57,073 --> 00:17:58,775
OH, SURE. YEAH.

395
00:17:58,842 --> 00:18:01,544
I HAVE EXCELLENT
COMPUTER SKILLS.

396
00:18:01,578 --> 00:18:03,813
I'VE GOT A
MATTEL INTELLIVISION.

397
00:18:03,847 --> 00:18:07,817
OH, YEAH!
64K OF MEMORY,
FOUR COLOUR.

398
00:18:07,851 --> 00:18:10,020
I THINK THEY'RE COMING
OUT WITH A KEYBOARD TOO.

399
00:18:10,086 --> 00:18:12,689
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S EXCITING.

400
00:18:12,722 --> 00:18:14,858
I DON'T KNOW, RED.

401
00:18:14,891 --> 00:18:16,693
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD
GET A NEW JOB?

402
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,096
I WOULD RECOMMEND MEDICAL
TREATMENT OF SOME KIND,

403
00:18:20,163 --> 00:18:22,632
AND THEN JUST TAKE
IT FROM THERE, YOU KNOW?

404
00:18:22,699 --> 00:18:24,901
NO. NO.

405
00:18:24,934 --> 00:18:27,537
RED, I'M GOING
TO KEEP THIS JOB.

406
00:18:27,604 --> 00:18:30,340
BUT, GORD,
IT'S TERRIBLE HOURS,

407
00:18:30,373 --> 00:18:31,741
AND YOU DON'T GET PAID.

408
00:18:31,808 --> 00:18:33,576
NOBODY ELSE IN THE
WORLD WOULD DO THAT.

409
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,844
THAT'S RIGHT, RED.

410
00:18:34,911 --> 00:18:37,847
THAT'S WHAT THEY
CALL JOB SECURITY.

411
00:18:37,881 --> 00:18:39,115
OKAY?

412
00:18:39,182 --> 00:18:40,717
OKAY, I GOTTA GO.

413
00:18:42,786 --> 00:18:43,753
SEE YOU!

414
00:18:46,856 --> 00:18:50,126
WELL, OUR POT LUCK DINNER
WAS NOT A TOTAL SUCCESS.

415
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,830
WELL, IT WASN'T THAT BAD.
NOT EVERYBODY GOT SICK.

416
00:18:56,232 --> 00:18:58,902
JUST THE ONES
WHO ATE THE FOOD.

417
00:18:58,968 --> 00:19:02,705
LUCKILY, THE SMELL
TURNED MOST PEOPLE OFF.

418
00:19:02,772 --> 00:19:04,874
YOU KNOW, THEY TELL ME
THAT SOME OF THOSE TREES

419
00:19:04,908 --> 00:19:07,811
WILL NEVER
HAVE LEAVES AGAIN.

420
00:19:07,877 --> 00:19:09,579
YOU KNOW I
JUST DON'T GET IT.

421
00:19:09,646 --> 00:19:11,214
MOST OF THOSE CANS
WERE BEANS OR CORN.

422
00:19:11,247 --> 00:19:13,016
WHAT WENT WRONG?

423
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:15,451
WELL, THEY WEREN'T ALL
BEANS OR CORN, DALTON.

424
00:19:15,485 --> 00:19:17,153
THAT'S WHAT WENT WRONG.

425
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,023
SOME WERE FLOOR WAX;
SOME WERE BODY FILLER.

426
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:22,525
YEAH, WELL, I THINK
IT WAS THE HAND CLEANER

427
00:19:22,592 --> 00:19:24,627
OH, MAN.
THAT DID THE REAL DAMAGE.

428
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:27,697
TURNED EVERYBODY
INTO A SOAP DISPENSER.

429
00:19:27,764 --> 00:19:29,899
WELL, NO HARM DONE.
EVERYBODY GOT THEIR
MONEY BACK.

430
00:19:29,966 --> 00:19:31,734
NO HARM DONE?

431
00:19:31,768 --> 00:19:34,737
WE'VE GOT NO STEEL SHED,
AND NOW WE'VE GOT
NOTHING TO SELL.

432
00:19:34,804 --> 00:19:36,406
YEAH, BUT THERE
WERE NO FATALITIES,

433
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:37,974
NO PERMANENT
INJURIES.

434
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,009
AROUND HERE, THAT'S WHAT
WE CALL NO HARM DONE.

435
00:19:40,076 --> 00:19:41,277
YEAH, I SUPPOSE.
YEAH, YEAH.

436
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:43,379
HEY, MR. GREEN!
I'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

437
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:44,981
NO DESSERT, MIKE.
I COULDN'T GO THERE.

438
00:19:45,048 --> 00:19:46,382
NO, NO, NO.

439
00:19:46,449 --> 00:19:50,420
I STACKED UP ALL THE EMPTY
CANS AND MADE A SHED
OUT OF THEM.

440
00:19:50,486 --> 00:19:53,356
WELL, MY GOSH, YOU KNOW
THAT'S PRETTY SMART.

441
00:19:53,423 --> 00:19:55,124
IT'S RIGHT OUTSIDE.
DO YOU WANT TO SEE IT?

442
00:19:55,158 --> 00:19:57,927
WELL, LET'S NOT KILL
MY ENTHUSIASM THAT
FAST, OKAY, MIKE?

443
00:19:57,994 --> 00:19:59,362
YOU SEE THERE, RED?

444
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:01,764
WHEN WE PUT OUR MINDS TOGETHER
WE ALWAYS SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

445
00:20:01,831 --> 00:20:03,333
YEAH.
I SUPPOSE SO.

446
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:04,767
HOPE YOU DIDN'T
POLLUTE THE LAKE

447
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:06,970
WHEN YOU RINSED
THOSE CANS OUT, EH?

448
00:20:07,036 --> 00:20:09,706
RINSE THE CANS OUT?
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

449
00:20:09,772 --> 00:20:11,507
WELL, IF YOU DON'T
RINSE THE CANS OUT,

450
00:20:11,574 --> 00:20:13,209
YOU'RE GOING
TO ATTRACT ANIMALS.

451
00:20:13,276 --> 00:20:16,045
ATTRACT ANIMALS,
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

452
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:18,715
[dogs barking]

453
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:31,527

00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:57,120
AND THEN AFTER WE COULD
HAVE A LITTLE SIZZLE.

WHOLE GANG UP HERE AT
POSSUM LODGE,

ALL RIGHT, BOW YOUR
HEADS FOR THE MEN'S PRAYER.

475
00:21:25,114 --> 00:21:28,150
I'M A MAN,
BUT I CAN CHANGE,

476
00:21:28,217 --> 00:21:31,888
IF I HAVE TO,
I GUESS.

477
00:21:33,456 --> 00:21:36,292
OKAY, MEN, WE GOT
A CALL FROM THE WIVES.

AND ANY OF YOU WHO HAD THE
POSSUM LODGE STEW,
