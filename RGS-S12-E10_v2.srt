THE FLAME IN THIS AREA.

154
00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:09,287
AND THEN ABOVE THAT IS
THE AIR CHAMBER WHERE
THE AIR GETS HEATED.

155
00:08:09,354 --> 00:08:11,323
AND THEN YOU HAVE
THE FAN

156
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:13,325
THAT FIRES THE WARM
AIR UP INTO THE HOUSE.

157
00:08:13,391 --> 00:08:15,260
AND THAT'S ALL IT DOES.

158
00:08:15,293 --> 00:08:17,195
WHAT A WASTE
OF ENGINEERING.

159
00:08:17,262 --> 00:08:20,098
WELL, I THINK WE CAN DO
A LITTLE BETTER THAN THAT.

160
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,935
OKAY, NOW WE'RE COOKING.

JUST A FURNACE ANYMORE.

WELL, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT IT IS,

165
00:08:32,978 --> 00:08:35,046
BUT IT'S NOT JUST A FURNACE.
THAT'S FOR SURE.

166

OKAY, YOU'VE GOT YOUR FURNACE
BURNER RIGHT DOWN AT
THE BOTTOM

SO THIS IS WHERE YOU
DO ALL YOUR BARBEQUING.

00:08:39,417 --> 00:08:41,620
YOU MIGHT EVEN THROW A FEW
BRIQUETTES ON THE BURNER.

TO MAKE YOUR HOUSE SMELL.

CHANGE, ISN'T IT?

BECOMES THE BOTTOM
OF MY OVEN, SEE?

173
00:08:51,796 --> 00:08:54,833
BUT BECAUSE IT'S
SO FAR ABOVE THE FLAMES,

00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:57,535
I CAN ACTUALLY BAKE
ON THE BOTTOM OF THE OVEN.

BE DONE IN ABOUT 20 MINUTES.

EVEN SOONER IF
WE HAVE A COLD SNAP.

THIS OLD GAS CAN

AS MY HOT WATER HEATER.

180
00:09:09,114 --> 00:09:10,582
A COUPLE OF THINGS
TO REMEMBER HERE...

181
00:09:10,615 --> 00:09:13,051
NUMBER ONE, DON'T
USE A PLASTIC GAS CAN.

182
00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:15,820
OF COURSE, HINDSIGHT
IS ALWAYS 20-20, ISN'T IT?

183
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:17,455
AND THE OTHER THING IS

184
00:09:17,522 --> 00:09:19,524
YOU WANT TO BE CAREFUL WITH
YOUR OVERHEAD PIPE JOINTS.

185
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:22,260

YOU THEY'RE TRICKY
TO DUCT TAPE.

00:09:22,293 --> 00:09:24,229
OH, AND HERE'S
ANOTHER BONUS...

187
00:09:24,262 --> 00:09:27,232
I'M USING MY
PULL-OUT FILTER

188
00:09:27,298 --> 00:09:29,868
AS A PIZZA OVEN.

IS NOT GOING TO GIVE US
THE KIND OF BTU'S WE NEED,

192
00:09:43,581 --> 00:09:45,817

HEAT CONTROL OUT OF THE OVEN.

YOU CAN GET THE HOUSE

AND THERE'S ONLY
ONE WAY TO SAVE IT.

215
00:11:38,362 --> 00:11:41,866
YOU GOT TO CONCENTRATE
ON THE AFTERNOON.

216
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:45,303
THAT'S THE ONLY TIME OF
THE DAY WHEN BOTH OF YOU
