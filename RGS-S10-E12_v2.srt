YOU WANNA GET OVER THERE

AND START PICKING
THOSE BABIES.

DON'T HAVE A DECENT LADDER --

OR MAYBE YOU DO,
BUT YOU LOANED IT TO SOMEBODY,

OR MAYBE YOU GAVE IT
BACK TO SOMEBODY.

7
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:16,216
THEN YOU START THINKING ABOUT
CLIMBING THE TREE TO GET
AT THE CHERRIES,

21
00:01:13,172 --> 00:01:15,742
WAS TAKING A HARD LOOK AT THE
POSSUM VAN THE OTHER DAY,

22
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:18,144
AND SHE'S DECIDED WE NEED
A SECOND VEHICLE,

ACTUALLY RIDE IN.

BIT ABOUT CARS,

ISN'T IT, LADIES?

I'VE MANAGED TO REMOVE
THE WATCH FROM THE MOLD.

115
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:57,189
NOW WHAT I DO IS POUR
OLIVE OIL INTO HER THERE

116
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:59,625
SO THAT NOTHING
WILL STICK TO IT.

117
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:01,660
THIS IS, UH, VIRGIN OLIVE OIL.

118
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:04,163
WELL, IT'S NEVER
BEEN USED FOR THIS BEFORE.

119
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:06,131
NOW ALL I GOTTA DO IS
USE MORE CEMENT

120
00:06:06,198 --> 00:06:08,834
AND INJECT IT INTO THE MOLD
WITH THIS CAKE DECORATOR.

121
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:12,504
THIS IS ALSO CALLED
A FORCED PIPING BAG.

122
00:06:12,571 --> 00:06:15,240
SOUNDS SCOTTISH,
DOESN'T IT?

123
00:06:15,307 --> 00:06:16,942
ALL RIGHT, YOU LAY
THAT IN THERE,

124
00:06:16,975 --> 00:06:19,444
AND YOU JUST LET HER SET
FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES.

125
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:24,816
OKAY, NOW I HAVE MY
PLASTER WATCH,

126
00:06:24,883 --> 00:06:26,785
WHICH IS AN EXACT REPLICA
OF MY ORIGINAL WATCH,

127
00:06:26,818 --> 00:06:29,488
INCLUDING, UNFORTUNATELY,
THE WARRANTY.

128
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,890
NOW, I'M JUST GONNA
PAINT THAT UP THERE

129
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,626
TO MAKE IT LOOK
EVEN MORE LIFELIKE.

130
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,028
ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL?

131
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:37,329
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT
TIME YOU PAINT IT TO,

132
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,231
IT'LL BE RIGHT
TWICE A DAY.

133
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:40,699
ENJOY THAT ONE, LADIES?

134
00:06:40,732 --> 00:06:43,201
ALL RIGHT, WHAT I'M GONNA DO
NOW TO MAKE IT INTO A
FRIDGE MAGNET

135
00:06:43,268 --> 00:06:45,370
IS TO ADD A LITTLE PIECE
OF MAGNET ONTO THE BACK
OF HER THERE.

136
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:46,872
THIS IS A REAL
POWERFUL MAGNET.

137
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,641
IT'S MADE OUT OF MOLYBDENITE
OR PLUTONIUM OR SOMETHING.

138
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:52,044
I'M JUST GONNA CUT A LITTLE
CHUNK OFF THE BACK OF THAT.

139
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:09,594
HAD A BIT OF A RE-THINK
ON THE MAGNET THING.

140
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:13,031
JUST GONNA USE A LITTLE PIECE
OF DUCT TAPE STUCK ON
THERE INSTEAD.

141
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:14,966
ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
WE'RE ALMOST FINISHED.

142
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:16,968
YOU CAN GO BACK TO YOUR
KNITTING ANY TIME NOW,

143
00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:18,904
BUT YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES IT'S
THOSE LAST COUPLE OF STEPS

144
00:07:18,937 --> 00:07:20,439
THAT REALLY MAKE
THE DIFFERENCE,

145
00:07:20,505 --> 00:07:22,374
MAKE IT A PROFESSIONAL
LOOKING JOB.

146
00:07:22,407 --> 00:07:24,509
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YEAH,
WE GOT IT PAINTED,

147
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:27,913
BUT REAL POTTERY HAS THAT NICE
SMOOTH GLAZE ON THE OUTSIDE,

148
00:07:27,946 --> 00:07:29,715
SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS
TAKE MY DISHWASHER HERE,

149
00:07:29,748 --> 00:07:31,083
AND TAKE THE INTAKE HOSE --

150
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:32,584
SEE THIS CAN OF LACQUER?

151
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:34,186
I JUST STICK THE INTAKE

OH, MEETING TIME,
THERE, Mr KNIEVEL.

455
00:21:06,062 --> 00:21:07,864
YOU GO AHEAD, WINSTON.
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

456
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,933
OKAY, IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

HONEY, UH, I THINK YOU SHOULD
GO OUT AND GET YOURSELF

WHATEVER CAR YOU WANT.

00:21:15,304 --> 00:21:19,442
BUT I'M BRINGING HOME KIND OF
AN INTERESTING LAWN SCULPTURE.

460
00:21:19,475 --> 00:21:23,846
IT'S KIND OF AN
AUTOMOTIVE CHARCOAL THEME.

461
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,784
IT ONLY COST ME 75 BUCKS,
BUT I BET IT'S WORTH 5,000.

462
00:21:28,851 --> 00:21:30,720
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

FOR HELPING ME PUT
THAT JEEP TOGETHER.

I KNOW THIS IS GOING
TO DISAPPOINT YOU,
