00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:21,880
NOW, THAT'S NOT LOUD ENOUGH
YET TO SCARE A BURGLAR
BUT IT WILL BE

142
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,151
ONCE WE HOOK IT UP TO
THE SPEAKER FROM THE
TELEVISION SET.

143
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:29,855
AND FROM THE REFRIGERATOR
WE NEED THIS,

REMOVE EACH OF THOSE THINGS

FROM EACH OF THE
THREE APPLIANCES.

147
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:52,844

OUT IS GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE
LONGER THAN I THOUGHT,

148

SO WHY DON'T YOU GET
BACK TO THE SHOW

149
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,783

00:07:05,924 --> 00:07:11,363
AND RANGER GORD PRETENDS
TO BE IN BETTER SHAPE
THAN I'M IN.

152
00:07:11,363 --> 00:07:14,866
LAST WEEK MY WIFE FOUND SOME
PICTURES OF ME WHEN I
WAS A TEENAGER.

153
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:17,369
YES, THEY HAD
PHOTOGRAPHY BACK THEN.

154
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:19,004
SHOULD HAVE SEEN
THE WAY I DRESSED,

155
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:21,106
THE WAY I COMBED MY
HAIR AND MY SHOES.

156
00:07:21,106 --> 00:07:22,841
PRETTY SCARY STUFF.

157
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:24,643
I DIDN'T LOOK NEARLY SHARP
AS I DO NOW, OF COURSE.

158
00:07:24,643 --> 00:07:25,977
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT MADE
ME FEEL BETTER

159
00:07:25,977 --> 00:07:27,612
WAS THINKING ABOUT THE
TEENAGERS OF TODAY

160
00:07:27,612 --> 00:07:29,214
AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE
HUMILIATED LOOKING BACK

161
00:07:29,214 --> 00:07:31,683
AT HOW THEY LOOKED 15 OR 20
YEARS DOWN THE ROAD, YOU KNOW.

162
00:07:31,683 --> 00:07:34,653
I MEAN, IMAGINE SOME FUTURE
VICE PRESIDENT OF I.B.M.

163
00:07:34,653 --> 00:07:37,422
PASSING AROUND PICTURES OF
HIMSELF WITH A PURPLE MOHAWK,

164
00:07:37,422 --> 00:07:40,826
CUTLERY FOR EARRINGS,
A DRAGON TATTOOED ON
HIS EXPOSED STOMACH

165
00:07:40,826 --> 00:07:42,494
AND JEANS SO BAGGY
IN THE CROTCH

166
00:07:42,494 --> 00:07:44,730
YOU GOT ROOM FOR
A FAMILY OF GROUNDHOGS.

167
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,133
SO IF YOU GOT A KID AT HOME
WHO LOOKS LIKE AN EXTRA
FROM "ROAD WARRIOR,"

168
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:50,135
TAKE LOTS OF
PICTURE OF HIM NOW,

169
00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:52,804
THEN WHEN HE WISES UP
AND GETS RESPECTABLE,

170
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:54,873
YOU CAN SELL
THEM BACK TO HIM

171
00:07:54,873 --> 00:07:57,375
ONE PICTURE AT A TIME.

172
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:01,046
SURE BEATS SAVING YOUR OWN
MONEY FOR RETIREMENT,
DOESN'T IT?

173
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:08,253
WELL, WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF
PROBLEMS WITH BUSTER'S
GUARD DOG BRUTUS.

174
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:09,988
YOU KNOW, MAYBE HE
SHOULDN'T HAVE RENTED

175
00:08:09,988 --> 00:08:12,791
THE MOST FEROCIOUS
DOG IN THE KENNEL.

176
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:16,061
THE ATTACK DOG GOT AWAY?
BRUTUS IS ON THE LOOSE?

177
00:08:16,061 --> 00:08:18,463
UNCLE RED,
THEY CAN SMELL FEAR!

178
00:08:18,463 --> 00:08:20,265
NOW, DON'T WORRY,
HAROLD.

179
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:21,833
BRUTUS IS FREE TO GO
ANYWHERE HE WANTS,

180
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,401
BUT FOR SOME REASON
HE'S JUST STAYING THERE

181
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:25,003
PATROLLING
BUSTER'S FRONT LAWN.

182
00:08:25,003 --> 00:08:27,672
WELL, BUSTER WON'T
BE GETTING ANY MAIL

183
00:08:27,672 --> 00:08:29,341
OR ANY VISITORS.

184
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:31,943
YEAH, THAT'S THE UPSIDE.

185
00:08:31,943 --> 00:08:36,615
THE DOWNSIDE BEING THAT
BUSTER IS ACTUALLY TRAPPED
IN HIS OWN HOUSE.

186
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:39,017
TRAPPED, OH NO,

187

HIRING AN ANIMAL TO
PROTECT YOUR INTERESTS

188
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,622
AND THEN
HE TURNS ON YOU.

189
00:08:43,622 --> 00:08:47,959
YEAH, I CAN IMAGINE THAT
MR. PRODUCER/DIRECTOR.

190
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:49,461
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
GOING TO DO?

191
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:51,630

WITH A PLAN THAT
WE CALL

COWERING INDOORS.

193

OTHER THAN THAT WE'RE
GOING TO RUN BACK AND
FORTH BETWEEN OUR VEHICLES

194
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:59,104
THROWING WIENIES OVER
OUR SHOULDERS TO
DISTRACT BRUTUS.

195
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:01,706
WELL, THERE IS A LESSON TO BE
LEARNED HERE, UNCLE RED.

196
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:03,208
BUSTER SHOULD HAVE
PHONED THE POLICE

197
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,576
AS SOON AS HIS LAWN
ORNAMENTS WERE STOLEN,

198
00:09:04,576 --> 00:09:06,878
BUT INSTEAD HE CHOSE
THE ROUTE OF REVENGE,

199
00:09:06,878 --> 00:09:08,146
AND NOW,
LIKE A PRISONER,

200
00:09:08,146 --> 00:09:12,050
HE IS TRAPPED IN HIS
OWN HOME, HA HA!

201
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,419

FROM HIS MISTAKE.

IS ON THE LOOSE AND

A DOBERMAN THOUGH.

209

NOW, I DON'T ACTUALLY
HAVE ELECTRICITY FOR
AN ALARM

224
00:10:13,244 --> 00:10:14,779
AND I USED TO HAVE
A GUARD DOG,

BUT HE COULDN'T
TAKE THE LONELINESS.

SO YOU HAVE NO SECURITY
SYSTEM AT ALL GORD?

ENTIRELY TRUE, RED.

SOPHISTICATED THIS WEEK

SOME SKEET SHOOTING.

OF NEAT LITTLE RIG,

THERE'S APPARENTLY A TRIGGER

BE ABLE TO PULL BACK --

INTO THAT WHEN HE HITS IT.

BUT UNFORTUNATELY HE JUST
ANCHORED HER ON THE ONE SIDE,

ALL RIGHT, WELL, HE MUST
HAVE BLANKED OUT THERE.

GIVE HER ANOTHER TRY HERE.

WAITING TO SHOOT.

I DON'T WANT --

00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:37,748
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE ALL SET.
THERE WE GO.

299
00:13:37,748 --> 00:13:39,550
I'M A LITTLE FED UP NOW
AND I'M STARTING TO REALIZE

300
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,886
THE BEST FUTURE FOR ME IN
SKEET SHOOTING IS RIGHT HERE.

301
00:13:41,886 --> 00:13:46,690
[ GUNSHOT ]
THERE WE GO, DEAD.

302
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,626
SEE YOU LATER, BILL.
THERE'S YOUR GUN BACK.

303
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:50,995
OH AND HERE'S YOUR SKEET!

304
00:13:53,297 --> 00:13:56,500
Red: COMING UP,
WE'RE GOING TO VISIT
DALTON'S STORE/LANDFILL SITE

305
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,237
AND HAROLD DECIDES TO FACE
THE GUARD DOG LIKE A MAN.

306
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:07,578
WELL, AS SO OFTEN HAPPENS
UP HERE AT THE LODGE,

307
00:14:07,578 --> 00:14:10,247
THIS GUARD DOG THING HAS GOTTEN
INTO A BIT OF A COMPETITION.

308
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:13,751
FLINTY McCLINTOCK GOT
HIMSELF A GERMAN SHEPHERD,

309
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:15,352
EAST GERMAN I THINK,

310
00:14:15,352 --> 00:14:17,288
ARTIE KAY WENT
WITH THE GREAT DANE,

311
00:14:17,288 --> 00:14:20,958
OLD MAN SEDGWICK GOT A
CHIHUAHUA BUT HE'S GOT
HER ON STEROIDS.

312
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,794
AND, NOW, JUNIOR SINGLETON
WENT THE OTHER WAY,

313
00:14:23,794 --> 00:14:25,729
HE GOT HIMSELF A CAT.

314
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:27,431
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
THAT'S NOT SO UNUSUAL.

315
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:31,101
THE CHINESE USED TO USE
SIAMESE CATS TO PROTECT
THEIR PALACES.

316
00:14:31,101 --> 00:14:34,038
THIS IS A MOUNTAIN
LION, HAROLD.

317
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:35,306
YEAH, IT ESCAPED
FROM THE LION SAFARI

318
00:14:35,306 --> 00:14:37,141
OR AT LEAST THAT'S
WHAT JUNIOR'S GOING
TO TELL THEM

319
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:38,976
WHEN THEY NOTICE
IT'S MISSING.

320
00:14:38,976 --> 00:14:40,811
YOU GUYS BETTER BE CAREFUL
WITH AN ANIMAL LIKE THAT!

321
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:42,346
THEY'RE NOT USED TO
SEEING PEOPLE, YOU KNOW,

322
00:14:42,346 --> 00:14:44,281
UNLESS THEY'RE IN CARS, YOU
KNOW, SNAPPING PICTURES

323
00:14:44,281 --> 00:14:46,917
AND TRYING TO SNEAK SNACK
FOOD OUT LITTLE CRACKS
IN WINDOWS.

324
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:48,152
WELL, I WOULDN'T
WORRY, HAROLD.

325
00:14:48,152 --> 00:14:49,687
I'M SURE IF THE MOUNTAIN LION
IS UPSET IN ANY WAY,

326
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:51,622
HE'LL LET US KNOW.

327
00:14:51,622 --> 00:14:53,157
SO NOW MOOSE IS
LOOKING TO RENT
A BEAR,

328
00:14:53,157 --> 00:14:55,492
AND STINKY IS GOING
TO TRY TO BRING AN
ALLIGATOR IN.

329
00:14:55,492 --> 00:14:57,428
I JUST THINK THE
COMPETITION IS SO CHILDISH.

330
00:14:57,428 --> 00:15:00,364
THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU ALWAYS LOSE.

331
00:15:00,364 --> 00:15:02,132
SO I'M THINKING OF GOING
HIGH TECH WITH MINE.

332
00:15:02,132 --> 00:15:05,469
I'M GOING TO BUILD MYSELF
A RADIO CONTROLLED
ELECTRONIC DOG.

333
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:10,140
OH BOY,
A ROBO ROTTWEILER.

334
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,209
YEAH, I'VE ALREADY GOT
THE RADIO CONTROLLER
RIGHT HERE.

335
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:14,111
WHAT FREQUENCY
IS THAT ON?

336
00:15:14,111 --> 00:15:16,447
107.3.

337
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:18,982
HEY, THAT'S THE SAME AS
MY VIDEO EFFECTS MACHINE.

338
00:15:21,151 --> 00:15:23,487
THAT DIDN'T LOOK SO HARD.

339
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:25,055
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE, BUDDY.

340
00:15:25,055 --> 00:15:26,990
YOU WANT COMPETITION,
I'LL GIVE YOU COMPETITION!

341
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:32,629
ALL RIGHT, I FINALLY GOT THE
COMPONENTS OUT OF THE
THREE APPLIANCES.

342
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:33,697
IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN A LOT EASIER

343
00:15:33,697 --> 00:15:35,632
IF SOMEONE HADN'T
STOLEN MY SCREWDRIVER.

344
00:15:35,632 --> 00:15:38,402
ANYWAY, NOW I CAN SHOW YOU
HOW TO ASSEMBLE THESE
THREE THINGS

345
00:15:38,402 --> 00:15:40,871
INTO YOUR VERY OWN
HOME SECURITY SYSTEM.

346
00:15:40,871 --> 00:15:44,107
ALL RIGHT, NOW, I'M JUST
USING THIS CHEST AND
THE LID OF IT

347
00:15:44,107 --> 00:15:46,376
AS KIND OF AN EXAMPLE OF
HOW YOU'D RIG UP A DOOR.

348
00:15:46,376 --> 00:15:48,779
I GOT THE PRESSURE SENSITIVE
SWITCH FROM THE FRIDGE

349
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:50,747
DOWN HERE HOOKED INTO
WHERE THE DOOR CLOSES,

350
00:15:50,747 --> 00:15:53,116
AND THAT WIRING GOES UP
THROUGH THE STOVE BUZZER,

351
00:15:53,116 --> 00:15:56,453
WHICH IS NOW WIRED INTO
OUR TELEVISION SPEAKER.

352
00:15:56,453 --> 00:15:59,656
SO WHEN A BURGLAR COMES
IN SAY A DOOR OR A WINDOW,

353
00:15:59,656 --> 00:16:00,991
WHATEVER YOU GOT RIGGED LIKE
THIS,

354
00:16:00,991 --> 00:16:04,127
ALL OF A SUDDEN...
[ HIGH-PITCHED BEEPING ]

355
00:16:04,127 --> 00:16:05,696
WHOA, YOU'RE GOING
TO HEAR THAT.

356
00:16:05,696 --> 00:16:07,731
THAT WILL WAKE YOU UP FROM
THE DEAD, THAT ONE.

357
00:16:07,731 --> 00:16:10,601
AND THEN YOU CAN CALL 911
OR SIC YOUR DOG ON THERE

358
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:13,270
OR GO DOWN THERE AND START
THROWING BASEBALL BATS
AT THE GUY,

359
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,972
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO.

360
00:16:14,972 --> 00:16:18,108
AND THAT WAY YOU GET TO
PROTECT YOUR JEWELS OR YOUR --

361
00:16:18,108 --> 00:16:20,410
I GUESS THAT'S A FRIDGE
AND A STOVE,

362
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,846
A TELEVISION SET,
WHATEVER.

363
00:16:22,846 --> 00:16:25,916
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

364
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,552
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

365
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:30,020
MAN!

366
00:16:32,122 --> 00:16:33,857
IT'S MAIL CALL.

367
00:16:38,128 --> 00:16:43,100
NO QUESTION TOO BIG,
NO ANSWER TOO SMALL.

368
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,236
OUR FIRST LETTER IS FROM
BRINKMAN HOOFNER,

369
00:16:46,236 --> 00:16:49,573
AND IT'S FROM,
OH, ACME, MISSOURI.

370
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:52,042
OH, LOOK, HE'S MADE US SOME
ARTWORK, ISN'T THAT NICE?

371
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:53,610
LOOK AT THAT.

372
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,846
MISSION INPOSSUMVILLE.

373
00:16:55,846 --> 00:16:58,715
[ LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY ]
[ CHUCKLING ]

374
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,986
I DON'T GET THAT.

375
00:17:02,986 --> 00:17:07,057
WELL, HAROLD,
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE
"MISSION IMPOSSIBLE,"

376
00:17:07,057 --> 00:17:09,726
MISSION IN POSSUM VILLE.

377
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:13,430
OHHHH! WHOO!

378
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:17,534
YOU STILL DON'T GET IT,
DO YOU, HAROLD?
NO, NOT REALLY.

379
00:17:17,534 --> 00:17:18,935
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE.

380
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:21,338
THIS IS FROM KIM
FROM FLATROCK, MICHIGAN.

381
00:17:21,338 --> 00:17:24,441
SHE WRITES: "DEAR RED,
HOW OLD ARE YOU?"

382
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:27,277
OH BOY, THAT'S A
TOUGH ONE, KIM,

383
00:17:27,277 --> 00:17:29,679
BECAUSE WE TAPE THE SHOW
THREE DAYS BEFORE IT
GOES ON THE AIR

384
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,381
SO THAT WE HAVE TIME
TO GO HOME AND FIGURE OUT

385
00:17:31,381 --> 00:17:33,416
HOW THE V.C.R.s
WORK AND SO ON.

386
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:36,119
SO IF I SAID I WAS 44 AND
THEN MY BIRTHDAY WAS TOMORROW

387
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:38,822
AND THEN I WOULD GO ON
THE AIR SAYING I WAS 44,
I WOULD BE 45 BY THEN.

388
00:17:38,822 --> 00:17:40,991
AND THEN IF YOU DIDN'T
SEE THAT SHOW,

389
00:17:40,991 --> 00:17:43,293
IT WOULD BE SIX MONTHS
LATER FOR THE RERUN,

390
00:17:43,293 --> 00:17:45,595
AND THEN, YOU KNOW, I WOULD
BE SIX MONTHS OFF ON
THE AGE THING.

391
00:17:45,595 --> 00:17:48,198
AND THEN, OF COURSE,
IF IT -- IF IT --

392
00:17:48,198 --> 00:17:49,399
IF IT GOT INTO A LOT
OF RERUNS --

393
00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:50,834
SOME OF THESE SHOWS
GO ON FOR YEARS,

394
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:52,302
THEY JUST STAY THERE
FOREVER LIKE A BAD SMELL.

395
00:17:52,302 --> 00:17:53,670
WHAT DO YOU
CALL THAT, HAROLD?

396
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,005
SYNDICATION.

397
00:17:55,005 --> 00:17:56,306
YEAH, SYNDICATION,
YEAH, YEAH.

398
00:17:56,306 --> 00:17:58,041
YOU KNOW BUT OF COURSE
THAT'S WHERE THE BIG BUCKS ARE

399
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,242
REALLY, YOU KNOW.

400
00:17:59,242 --> 00:18:00,677
I HOPE OUR SHOW GOES
INTO SYNDICATION.

401
00:18:00,677 --> 00:18:02,112
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

402
00:18:02,112 --> 00:18:06,149
ALL WE NEED IS LIKE
A MUCH BETTER SHOW.

403
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:08,018
I THINK WE'RE CLOSE TO
HAVING A MUCH BETTER ONE.

404
00:18:08,018 --> 00:18:09,386
YOU BETTER
BELIEVE IT.

405
00:18:09,386 --> 00:18:11,154
SO I THINK THE SAFEST
ANSWER, KIM, THERE IS

406
00:18:11,154 --> 00:18:14,658
THAT WHEN YOU SEE THIS SHOW,
I'M 10 YEARS, 6 MONTHS

407
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:17,560
AND 3 DAYS YOUNGER
THAN I LOOK RIGHT NOW.

408
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,130
SO YOU'RE IN YOUR
EARLY 60s THEN.

409
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,631
THANK YOU, HAROLD.

410
00:18:21,631 --> 00:18:24,267
OH, MISSION INPOSSUMVILLE!

411
00:18:27,437 --> 00:18:31,041
YOU STILL DON'T
GET IT, DO YOU?
NOT A THING.

412
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:34,210
WE'RE OUT HERE BY THE MAIN
HIGHWAY AT HUMPHRIES
EVERYTHING STORE

413
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,146
TO LEARN A LITTLE BIT
MORE ABOUT ANTIQUES,

414
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:40,116
COLLECTIBLES AND CURIOS
FROM STORE OWNER,
DALTON HUMPHRIES.

415
00:18:40,116 --> 00:18:42,452
NOW, DALTON, WHAT IS
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
AN ANTIQUE,

416
00:18:42,452 --> 00:18:46,689
A COLLECTIBLE, A CURIO
OR JUST A PIECE OF
KITSCHY CRAPOLLA?

417
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:50,693
ABOUT $500
PROFIT FOR ME.

418
00:18:50,693 --> 00:18:53,296
LET'S HAVE A LOOK.

419
00:18:54,564 --> 00:18:59,803
NOW, THIS RADIO IS A CLASSIC
ADDISON, CIRCA 1930,

420
00:18:59,803 --> 00:19:03,807
AND AT AUCTION THIS
WOULD FETCH $2,500.

421
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,508
OH MY GOSH!
YEAH.

422
00:19:05,508 --> 00:19:07,744
HOW MUCH WOULD IT GET IF
IT WASN'T ALL BAFFED UP
LIKE THAT?

423
00:19:07,744 --> 00:19:09,479
$200.

424
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:11,080
YOU SEE, WHAT YOU
CALL "BAFFED UP"

425
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,117
IS WHAT A CUSTOMER
CALLS CHARACTER.
OH I SEE.

426
00:19:14,117 --> 00:19:16,452
YOU SEE BEFORE A GUY
PLOPS DOWN $2500,

427
00:19:16,452 --> 00:19:19,422
HE WANTS TO KNOW A LITTLE
BIT ABOUT THE RADIO,

428
00:19:19,422 --> 00:19:23,226
SO I WOULD POINT OUT TO
HIM THE BEAUTIFUL GRAIN
OF THIS TORTOISE SHELL CASE,

429
00:19:23,226 --> 00:19:26,596
THE CLASSIC THREE-TUBE
ELECTRONICS INSIDE,

430
00:19:26,596 --> 00:19:28,965
THE LOVELY DIAL HERE,
WHICH IS EXTREMELY RARE,

431
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:31,668
AND ENAMELED ON COPPER,

432
00:19:31,668 --> 00:19:34,103
THE BAKELITE KNOBS
WHICH ARE INLAID WITH
MOTHER OF PEARL,

433
00:19:34,103 --> 00:19:36,105
VERY RARE,
VERY GOOD QUALITY,

434
00:19:36,105 --> 00:19:38,841
AND THESE PSEUDO-CERAMIC BARS
WHICH WERE HANDCRAFTED

435
00:19:38,841 --> 00:19:41,978
BY A CERAMICIST BY THE
NAME OF JOHN REYNOLDS.

436
00:19:41,978 --> 00:19:45,848
ALL AND ALL AN INCREDIBLE
PIECE OF HISTORY.

437
00:19:45,848 --> 00:19:47,650
WOW!

438
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,452
YOU MADE THAT WHOLE
THING UP, DIDN'T YOU?

439
00:19:49,452 --> 00:19:52,288
EVERY LAST WORD, RED.

440
00:19:52,288 --> 00:19:53,756
QUITE A PERFORMANCE.

441
00:19:53,756 --> 00:19:57,460
YEAH, WELL I WOULD SAY
IT'S WORTH $2,500.

442
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,162
THIS RADIO RIGHT HERE
I KIND OF GOT MY EYE ON.

443
00:19:59,162 --> 00:20:01,164
DESCRIBE THAT ONE
