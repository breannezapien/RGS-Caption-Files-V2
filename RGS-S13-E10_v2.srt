SOMETHING INTO IT,

THERE'S NO MORE ROOM.

AND WHY?

00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:15,615
BECAUSE OF THE VEGETABLES.

TO KEEP VEGETABLES FRESH.

IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN
THE REST OF THE FRIDGE.

13
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:29,963
ANYWAY, YOU CAN'T STOP
VEGETABLES FROM GOING BAD.

14

THEY WERE BAD TO BEGIN WITH.

BUT YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE 'EM
OUT AND THROW 'EM AWAY,
CAN YOU?

OR SOMEBODY'D
BE VERY UPSET.

THINGS TO YOU IN THE NIGHT.

YOU WERE HOPING FOR.

RID OF YOUR VEGETABLES

WITHOUT LAYING
A FINGER ON 'EM.

21
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:48,548
I PUNCHED A HOLE IN
THE BACK OF THE FRIDGE.

THESE TWO K-CARS,

WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE
ALMOST ONE DRIVABLE VEHICLE.

172
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,643
THAT'S BECAUSE THE K-CAR HAS
NO REAL FRAME TO SPEAK OF,

AND THEY'RE

THAN NAILING A SPEED BUMP,

THIS ONE TO THE LEFT,

TO THE RIGHT.

IS THE GEAR SHIFT.

OKAY, HOW 'BOUT MIKE
SNEAKS BACK INTO
CARIBOU LODGE

310
00:14:23,127 --> 00:14:25,062
AND GETS
OUR POSSUM BACK?

311
00:14:25,062 --> 00:14:27,264
YEAH, 'CAUSE I LOOK
JUST LIKE ONE.

312
00:14:27,264 --> 00:14:29,533
WATCH.

313
00:14:33,337 --> 00:14:34,772
Harold:
HAVE YOU SEEN ENOUGH?

314
00:14:34,772 --> 00:14:36,974
YOU'RE TOO LATE.

315
00:14:38,075 --> 00:14:39,977
Red: KIND OF AN UNUSUAL
ADVENTURE THIS TIME.

316
00:14:39,977 --> 00:14:41,712
WINSTON HAD JUST
FINISHED A DAY'S WORK,

317
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:45,349
AND AS PER USUAL,
HE WAS CHECKING HIS CASH,

318
00:14:45,349 --> 00:14:48,285
AND THERE WAS A SMALL
CRIME WAVE AT THAT MOMENT.

319
00:14:48,285 --> 00:14:51,355
A GUN COMES IN -- THIS NEVER
HAPPENS AROUND HERE, BUT...

320
00:14:51,355 --> 00:14:55,192
AS IT TURNS OUT,
JUST A WATER GUN FROM WALTER.

321
00:14:55,192 --> 00:14:58,862
OH, NOW WINSTON GRABS THAT
AND TAKES AFTER HIM.

322
00:14:58,862 --> 00:15:00,464
THIS IS HOW THINGS START.

323
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:02,166
AND THIS IS A REAL LESSON
OF HOW THE WORLD WORKS

324
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,168
WITH THE ARMS RACE
AND SO ON.

325
00:15:04,168 --> 00:15:06,670
WINSTON HAS THE LITTLE GUN.
HE'S SNEAKING UP ON WALTER.

326
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,572
A LITTLE PAYBACK TIME,
BUT WALTER TURNS AROUND

327
00:15:08,572 --> 00:15:10,274
AND HE HAS A
MUCH BIGGER GUN,

328
00:15:10,274 --> 00:15:12,876
AND HE UNLOADS THAT ON HIM.

329
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:14,445
SO NOW WINSTON
GRABS THAT ONE.

330
00:15:14,445 --> 00:15:16,013
NOW HE'S ESCALATED
HER A BIT,

331
00:15:16,013 --> 00:15:18,215
SO WALTER'S GOING TO TAKE
IT UP TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

332
00:15:18,215 --> 00:15:19,516
WINSTON COMES AROUND THERE.

333
00:15:19,516 --> 00:15:21,985
I DON'T THINK HE'S
IN THE WOOD PILE.

334
00:15:21,985 --> 00:15:26,089
AND I DON'T THINK HE'S
IN THAT EMPTY TRAILER EITHER.

335
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:30,194
I DON'T THINK HE'S
THERE OR THERE.

336
00:15:30,194 --> 00:15:34,131
HERE HE COMES, AND,
YOU KNOW, I'M THINKIN'

337
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:35,766
HE MAY HAVE
SOMETHING FOR YOU,

338
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:37,601
BUT WINSTON FIRST
OF ALL FIRES THE --

339
00:15:37,601 --> 00:15:39,136
WINSTON'S OUTTA WATER.

340
00:15:39,136 --> 00:15:41,438
DON'T WORRY.
HERE'S SOME.

341
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:47,878
SO NOW WE'RE UP
ANOTHER LEVEL.

342
00:15:47,878 --> 00:15:52,216
SO NOW IT'S GUNFIGHT
AT THE OK CORRAL.

343
00:15:52,216 --> 00:15:54,851
VERY GOOD TURN OUT
FOR A TUESDAY.

344
00:15:54,851 --> 00:15:58,055
OH, WALTER'S TAKIN'
IT TO ANOTHER LEVEL.

345
00:15:58,055 --> 00:15:59,923
WINSTON... HMM.

346
00:15:59,923 --> 00:16:02,626
WE'VE ALL HAD DAYS
LIKE THAT, HAVEN'T WE?

347
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:05,395
OH, BOY.

348
00:16:09,232 --> 00:16:11,134
SO NOW WINSTON GOES
DOWN TO THE STORE

349
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:13,136
AND GETS SOMETHING
REAL SUPER DUPER.

350
00:16:13,136 --> 00:16:15,639
PUMPS THAT UP.
OH, YEAH, BABY.

351
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:18,609
HE'S READY TO GO.
HE'S GOIN' NUCLEAR.

352
00:16:18,609 --> 00:16:21,979
WHAT HE DIDN'T REALIZE WAS
THAT WALTER HAD BEEN TO
THE SAME STORE

353
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:25,382
JUST BEFORE WINSTON AND HAD
GONE WITH THE DOUBLE
EXTRA LARGE.

354
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:29,653
LOTTA WATER IN THAT THING

355
00:16:29,653 --> 00:16:32,055
AS WINSTON'S PANTS
WERE ABOUT TO FIND OUT.

356
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,666
SO NOW WALTER'S GOING
TO THE MAXIMUM HERE.

357
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:46,036
HE'S GOT THE BACKPACK
TANKS ON THERE,

358
00:16:46,036 --> 00:16:47,371
AT THE SUPER-HOWITZER LEVEL.

359
00:16:47,371 --> 00:16:49,172
WINSTON JUST
HAS A LITTLE GUN,

360
00:16:49,172 --> 00:16:50,741
BUT HE DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE WORRIED.

361
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:52,209
HE'S ACTUALLY
WAVING WALTER OVER.

362
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:54,244
HE'S READY TO TAKE HIM ON.
WALTER CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

363
00:16:54,244 --> 00:16:55,879
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE ME ON
WITH THAT LITTLE THING?

364
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:57,981
LOOK AT THIS BABY.
I GOT LIKE A BAZOOKA.

365
00:16:57,981 --> 00:16:59,449
I MEAN, YOU ARE
GONNA DROWN.

366
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:00,784
YOU'RE JUST GONNA DROWN.

367
00:17:00,784 --> 00:17:02,753
WINSTON SAYS,
NO, NO, WAIT A SEC.

368
00:17:02,753 --> 00:17:04,788
IT'S NOT THE SIZE
OF THE GUN, YOU KNOW.

369
00:17:04,788 --> 00:17:07,257
CHECK THE HOSE.
TAKE A LOOK.

370
00:17:07,257 --> 00:17:08,425
SEE THAT? YUP.

371
00:17:08,425 --> 00:17:10,227
YEAH. YEAH. YEAH.

372
00:17:10,227 --> 00:17:12,662
OH, IT'S NOT PLUGGED
INTO THE CHAIR, NO.

373
00:17:12,662 --> 00:17:14,731
IT'S NOT -- OH, BOY!

374
00:17:19,436 --> 00:17:23,507
I THINK THIS IS WALTER'S
WAY OF SURRENDERING.

375
00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:26,276
THERE YOU GO.
LET HER GO.

376
00:17:36,353 --> 00:17:38,355
YOU EVER NOTICE
THAT OVER THE YEARS

377
00:17:38,355 --> 00:17:41,091
YOUR DASHBOARD HAS CHANGED FROM
A BUNCH OF DIALS AND GAUGES

378
00:17:41,091 --> 00:17:43,360
INTO NOTHING BUT
IDIOT LIGHTS.

379
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,495
THAT CAN'T BE A COMPLIMENT.

380
00:17:45,495 --> 00:17:47,864
AND WHO CAN REMEMBER
WHAT THEY ALL MEAN?

381
00:17:47,864 --> 00:17:49,599
WHENEVER I LOOK AT
THAT SYMBOL,

382
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:51,701
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I'M
SUPPOSED TO ADD OIL

383
00:17:51,701 --> 00:17:53,436
OR MAKE THREE WISHES.

384
00:17:53,436 --> 00:17:55,538
SO I'M GONNA MAKE
A FEW ALTERATIONS.

385
00:17:55,538 --> 00:17:57,674
FIRST OF ALL, I'M GONNA
PUT IN SENSIBLE SIGNS.

386
00:17:57,674 --> 00:17:59,676
AND I'M ALSO GONNA HAVE A WAY
THAT I CAN ADD FLUID

387
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:01,344
WITHOUT HAVING TO
GET OUT OF THE CAR.

388
00:18:01,344 --> 00:18:03,780
HECK, WITHOUT EVEN
HAVING TO STOP.

389
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,350
NOW, I'M GONNA DO THAT BY
SWITCHING FROM SOMETHING
NOBODY UNDERSTANDS...

390
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,785
THE CARS OF TODAY,

391
00:18:08,785 --> 00:18:10,453
TO SOMETHING EVERYBODY
UNDERSTANDS...

392
00:18:10,453 --> 00:18:11,721
BREAKFAST.

393
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:13,723
OKAY, FIRST THING YOU
WANNA DO IS TAKE YOURSELF

394
00:18:13,723 --> 00:18:15,625
HALF A DOZEN OF THESE
MAPLE SYRUP DISPENSERS

395
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,093
THAT THEY USE IN
RESTAURANTS.

396
00:18:17,093 --> 00:18:21,998
I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU
GET THESE FROM ANY DIMLY
LIT 24-HOUR DINER.

397
00:18:21,998 --> 00:18:25,268
THE KEY COMPONENT HERE, SEE,
IS THE SPRING LOADED NOZZLE

398
00:18:25,268 --> 00:18:27,003
THEY GOT ON THE
TOP OF HER THERE.

399
00:18:27,003 --> 00:18:28,705
JUST ADD A WIRE
TO THIS BABY,

400
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:30,507
FILL IT WITH THE
APPROPRIATE FLUID,

401
00:18:30,507 --> 00:18:32,842
AND YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY
TO HAPPY MOTORING.

402
00:18:34,244 --> 00:18:37,681
EACH OF THESE BOTTLES IS
FILLED WITH A DIFFERENT
AUTOMOTIVE FLUID.

403
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:41,584
AND I GOT THEM MOUNTED OVER
EACH OF THESE FILLER TUBES.

404
00:18:43,153 --> 00:18:45,488
THEN I RAN ALL THE WIRES
THROUGH THE FIRE WALL,

405
00:18:45,488 --> 00:18:47,857
AND IN KEEPING WITH
THE BREAKFAST MOTIF,

406
00:18:47,857 --> 00:18:49,859
I ATTACHED A PICTURE
ONTO EACH WIRE

407
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:53,296
THAT WOULD ASSOCIATE
A FLUID DEFICIENCY

408
00:18:53,296 --> 00:18:55,732
WITH A BREAKFAST FOOD.

409
00:18:55,732 --> 00:18:57,901
NOW EVEN FOR YOUR CAR,

410
00:18:57,901 --> 00:19:00,737
BREAKFAST IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT MEAL OF THE DAY.

411
00:19:00,737 --> 00:19:04,841
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

412

THAT HAS TO BE BACON.

414
00:19:09,746 --> 00:19:12,315
BRING HOME THE BACON.

415
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:16,519

416
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:18,588
WELL, THAT'S GOTTA
BE COFFEE.

STARTS GRINDIN',

AND IF YOUR ENGINE
STARTS FRYIN',

420
00:19:26,863 --> 00:19:29,499

BE THE EGGS.

THIS MEETING PRETTY SHORT,

462
00:21:24,647 --> 00:21:26,582
BECAUSE A FEW OF US HAVE
TO TAKE OFF ALL OUR CLOTHES

463
00:21:26,582 --> 00:21:28,684
AND BURN 'EM.

464
00:21:34,023 --> 00:21:35,424
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

465
00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:36,726
WE'RE CHANGING.

466
00:21:36,726 --> 00:21:37,994
WHY?

467
00:21:37,994 --> 00:21:40,596
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO,
I GUESS.
