I PUT ALL THE DAYS OF
THE COMING WEEK

158
00:08:00,545 --> 00:08:03,715
WHEN I MIGHT WANNA BUSY
MYSELF WITH A PROJECT.

159
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:05,484
BERNICE'S MOTHER
IS IN TOWN,

160
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:07,586
SO I'M GOIN' WITH ALL SEVEN.

161
00:08:10,355 --> 00:08:12,190
NEXT, I WENT
THROUGH THE GARAGE,

162
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,493
LOOKIN' AT ALL THE DIFFERENT
COLOURS OF PAINT I HAD

163
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:18,463
IN THE HALF-EMPTY PAINT TINS,
MARGARINE TUBS AND
SAMPLE BOTTLES.

164
00:08:18,463 --> 00:08:20,966
THEN I WROTE DOWN THE
NAMES OF ALL THOSE COLOURS

165
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:24,436
AND MOUNTED THEM
ON MY SECOND WHEEL.

166
00:08:24,436 --> 00:08:27,305
OKAY, ON THIS ONE I WROTE
ALL THE RAW MATERIAL

167
00:08:27,305 --> 00:08:29,107
I FOUND LYING AROUND MY YARD

168
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:31,943
AND THE YARDS OF MY
NEIGHBOURS WHO AREN'T HOME.

169
00:08:31,943 --> 00:08:33,245
OH, BY THE WAY.

170
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:35,513
I FIND IF YOU WRITE DOWN
TWO OR MORE PIECES OF JUNK

171
00:08:35,513 --> 00:08:36,815
ON EACH STRIP OF TAPE,

172
00:08:36,815 --> 00:08:39,217
IT REALLY INCREASES
THE CHALLENGE LEVEL.

173
00:08:39,217 --> 00:08:41,152
AND FINALLY ON
THE FOURTH WHEEL,

174
00:08:41,152 --> 00:08:43,188
I WROTE DOWN THE NAMES OF A
FEW THINGS THAT NEEDED DOING,

175
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:46,024
FIXING, IMPROVING
AROUND THE HOUSE.

176
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:49,160
I GOT THEM FROM A LIST
MY WIFE HAD GIVEN ME.

177
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:52,864
I COULDN'T GET ALL OF HER
SUGGESTIONS ON THERE.

178
00:08:52,864 --> 00:08:54,199
OH, AND I ALMOST FORGOT.

179
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:57,335
ON EACH HUB,
I'VE TAPED A POINTER.

180
00:08:57,335 --> 00:09:00,639
THIS IS HOW WE READ THE
RESULTS FROM EACH WHEEL.

181
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,741
PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER,
AND WHAT YOU HAVE

182
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:05,910
IS THE HANDYMAN'S
RANDOM PROJECT PLANNER.

183
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,013
LET'S GIVE THIS
BABY A SPIN.

184
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,360
OKAY, LET'S SEE
WHAT WE GOT HERE.

185
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,764
ON TUESDAY, I'M GOING TO BUILD
A YELLOW, SHAG-CARPETED
BIRDFEEDER

186
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:27,899
OUT OF A MILK CRATE;

187
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:30,835
AND ON WEDNESDAY I'M INSTALLING
PURPLE KEVLAR STORM SHUTTERS

188
00:09:30,835 --> 00:09:32,804
INTO THE TOOL SHED;

189
00:09:32,804 --> 00:09:36,040
AND ON THURSDAY,
IT'S A TURQUOISE SPICE RACK

190
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,610
MADE FROM HOCKEY STICKS
AND A GARDEN HOSE.

191
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,879
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

192
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:43,081
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

193
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:44,349
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

194
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:46,117
I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO WAX MY CAR,

195
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:49,788
USING SCUBA FLIPPERS AND A
BUNCH OF OLD KETCHUP PACKETS.

196
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,994
[ APPLAUSE ]

197
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:05,436
REMEMBER, WHEN YOU
MAKE ENOUGH DEPOSITS,

198
00:10:05,436 --> 00:10:08,106
IT'S TIME FOR A WITHDRAWAL.

199
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:12,544
SHE'S INCREDIBLE!
SHE'S AWESOME!

200
00:10:12,544 --> 00:10:13,711
SHE'S FANTASTIC!

201
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:15,246
IT'S LIKE SHE'S MADE FOR ME
OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW?

202
00:10:15,246 --> 00:10:16,447
SHE EVEN KNOWS WHAT
I'M THINKIN'.

203
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,216
SHE EVEN FINISHES MY --
YOUR SENTENCES?

204
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:20,218
YEAH!

205
00:10:20,218 --> 00:10:23,187
AND NO ONE DOES THAT.
NO.

206
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:25,123
DOES SHE HAVE A
NAME AT ALL, HAROLD?

207
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:27,258
BONNIE.

208
00:10:27,258 --> 00:10:29,694
IS THAT SHORT
FOR SOMETHING?

209
00:10:29,694 --> 00:10:33,298
YEAH, BONNEVILLE.

210
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:36,501
PROBABLY CONCEIVED
IN A PONTIAC.

211
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:39,170
WELL, I ASKED HER
TO THE MARSH GAS BLOWOUT.

212
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,873
YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE
WHAT SHE SAID TO ME.

213
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:44,876
LEAVE OUT THE
SWEAR WORDS, HAROLD.

214
00:10:44,876 --> 00:10:46,878
SHE SAID YES!

215
00:10:46,878 --> 00:10:48,513
SHE SAID YES!
SHE SAID YES!

216
00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:51,282
[ APPLAUSE ]

217
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:54,152
I'M GOING WITH
A GIRL TO A DANCE.

218
00:10:54,152 --> 00:10:55,787
I STILL GOT PROBLEMS.
WOULD YOU RELAX?

219
00:10:55,787 --> 00:10:57,755
WOULD YOU PLEASE
JUST SETTLE DOWN,

220
00:10:57,755 --> 00:10:58,990
BECAUSE I GOT PROBLEMS.

221
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,725
I TOLD HER I'D PICK
HER UP AT 7 O'CLOCK,

222
00:11:00,725 --> 00:11:03,061
BUT I DON'T HAVE A CAR
OR A DRIVER'S LICENSE.

223
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:04,429
WELL, THAT'S
NOT A PROBLEM.

224
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:06,564
I MEAN, YOUR BICYCLE
HAS A CROSSBAR, RIGHT?

225
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:11,002
YES, BUT NO, C'MON,
DRIVE US, PLEASE.

226
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:12,537
PLEASE JUST DRIVE US
TO THE POSSUM DANCE.

227
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:13,805
PLEASE. PLEASE. PLEASE.

228
00:11:13,805 --> 00:11:15,139
IN THE POSSUM VAN?

229
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:17,008
AFTER YOU'VE SAID THOSE
HURTFUL THINGS TO US

230
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:18,276
FOR SO MANY YEARS?

231
00:11:18,276 --> 00:11:19,944
YES.

232
00:11:21,112 --> 00:11:22,847
WELL, OKAY, HAROLD,
BUT THERE'S ONLY
TWO SEATS.

233
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:24,348
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO SIT ON THE ENGINE.

234
00:11:24,348 --> 00:11:25,750
OH, NO PROBLEM.

235
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,419
EVER SINCE PUBERTY, I FEEL
LIKE I'VE BEEN SITTING
ON THE ENGINE.

236
00:11:29,921 --> 00:11:33,024
[ APPLAUSE ]

237
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,626
Red: WE WENT OUT
BEHIND THE LODGE THERE

238
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:37,462
BECAUSE WALTER HAD A
LITTLE PHOTO THING SET UP,

239
00:11:37,462 --> 00:11:38,563
AND WE WANTED TO --

240
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:39,964
IT LOOKS LIKE HE
STARTED AT 20 BUCKS,

241
00:11:39,964 --> 00:11:42,366
AND HE'S DOWN TO --
SO I SAID, HOW'S BUSINESS?

242
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:44,035
HE'S GOT NO
SENSE OF HUMOUR, YOU KNOW,

243
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:45,403
SO I THOUGHT,
WELL, ALL RIGHT.

244
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:47,038
SO I GOT A LOONIE
OUT THERE

245
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:48,973
AND OKAY, TAKE OUR PICTURES.

246
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:50,608
BUT HE SAYS, NO, THESE
ARE NOVELTY PICTURES.

247
00:11:50,608 --> 00:11:52,143
YOU GOTTA PUT COSTUMES ON.

248
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:53,377
AW, COME ON.

249
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:55,313
HE SAYS, YOU CAN BE
LIKE A SOLDIER

250
00:11:55,313 --> 00:11:57,815
OR A MARCHING GUY
OR A FOOTBALL -- YOU KNOW.

251
00:11:57,815 --> 00:11:58,983
AND THEN DALTON
DOESN'T WANNA.

252
00:11:58,983 --> 00:12:00,418
I SAID, COME ON.
GIVE THE GUY A BREAK.

253
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:01,919
GET IN THERE.
GET IN THERE.

254
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,222
IT'S GONNA BE A NICE
COSTUME OF SOME KIND.

255
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:07,825
SO HE DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF
SELECTION ON THE COSTUMES.

256
00:12:07,825 --> 00:12:10,962
I GOT THE KIND OF
AN AIRLINE CAPTAIN THING.

257
00:12:10,962 --> 00:12:16,701
BUT I THINK WINSTON
WAS THE REAL WINNER.

258
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:18,769
AND HE DIDN'T WANNA TAKE
THE PICTURE RIGHT THERE.

259
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:20,705
HE WANTED TO GO OVER
TO ANOTHER FIELD.

260
00:12:20,705 --> 00:12:23,174
I GUESS THE LIGHT WAS
BETTER OR SOMETHING.

261
00:12:23,174 --> 00:12:25,910
SO WE GO ACROSS THE STREET.

262
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,145
SO WHAT HE'S SAYIN' IS,
IF YOU CAN'T SEE THE CAMERA,

263
00:12:28,145 --> 00:12:30,248
THE CAMERA CAN'T SEE YOU.

264
00:12:30,248 --> 00:12:32,450
SO WINSTON WAS THE ONE HAVING
THE REAL PROBLEM THERE,

265
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,986
SO HE'S SORT OF
JUMPING UP AND --

266
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:39,323
MEANWHILE, BILL WAS
HUNTING RABBIT,

267
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:41,692
AND, UH, --

268
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:45,997
THOUGHT HE SPOTTED
THE MOTHER LODE.

269
00:12:46,664 --> 00:12:48,132
WELL, THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

270
00:12:48,132 --> 00:12:50,835
BILL, BILL, COME ON!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

271
00:12:50,835 --> 00:12:53,671
THAT'S NOT A RABBIT, BILL.
IT'S NOT A RABBIT.

272
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:55,272
HI, BILL.

273
00:12:55,272 --> 00:12:57,141
I -- IT -- OH.

274
00:12:57,141 --> 00:12:59,243
BILL, IT'S NOT A RABBIT.

275
00:12:59,243 --> 00:13:01,345
STOP SHOOTING.
BILL, STOP IT.

276
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:02,813
BILL, NO!

277
00:13:02,813 --> 00:13:03,881
OKAY, GREAT, YEAH.

278
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:06,016
NO, BILL, BILL, BILL.
IT'S WINSTON.

279
00:13:06,016 --> 00:13:07,885
IT'S WINSTON
IN A RABBIT SUIT.

280
00:13:07,885 --> 00:13:09,887
AND HE'S NOT
IN THE BEST MOOD EVER.

281
00:13:09,887 --> 00:13:11,722
SO THEN WE FIGURE, WELL,
LET'S GET BILL TO JOIN US

282
00:13:11,722 --> 00:13:13,124
FOR THE GROUP PHOTO.

283
00:13:13,124 --> 00:13:14,725
WE HAVE ONE MORE COSTUME.

284
00:13:14,725 --> 00:13:16,327
WE THINK IT'D BE
A PERFECT COSTUME FOR BILL.

285
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:17,895
SO WE GET HIM ALL --

286
00:13:17,895 --> 00:13:21,699
AND I THINK HE'S LOOKIN'
PRETTY SPECTACULAR,
DON'T YOU?

287
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:23,934
SO NOW WE'RE ALL SET.

288
00:13:23,934 --> 00:13:25,669
BUT THIS IS TAKIN'
SO DARNED LONG

289
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:27,238
THAT WALTER SAYS
HE'S LOSIN' LIGHT.

290
00:13:27,238 --> 00:13:30,608
HE NEEDS TO GET SOME KIND OF A
FLASH UNIT FOR THE CAMERA.

291
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:32,042
HE'S GOT AN OLDER CAMERA,

292
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:33,711
SO IT'S GOT THE
OLDER STYLE OF FLASH.

293
00:13:33,711 --> 00:13:36,647
YOU KNOW, THEY'VE GOT
THE MAGNESIUM FLASH
POWDER ON THERE.

294
00:13:36,647 --> 00:13:38,949
SO HE PUTS THAT
INTO THE TRAY.

295
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:41,452
MEANWHILE, HE'S LEFT US
A LITTLE TOO LONG IN THE SUN,

296
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:45,189
AND TEMPERS ARE STARTIN'
TO FLARE A LITTLE BIT.

297
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:47,658
SO WALTER COMES OUT
TO SORT THAT OUT.

298
00:13:47,658 --> 00:13:50,628
AND WINSTON FIGURES,
YOU KNOW, IT'D BE KINDA FUNNY

299
00:13:50,628 --> 00:13:55,232
TO PUT A LITTLE MORE FLASH
POWDER INTO THE TRAY.

300
00:13:55,232 --> 00:13:59,303
SO HE GOES BACK AND
THINGS ARE SETTLING DOWN.

301
00:13:59,303 --> 00:14:01,772
SO YOU KNOW,
DALTON GOES BACK,

302
00:14:01,772 --> 00:14:03,841
AND DALTON'S FIGURING,
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE FUNNY?

303
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:07,478
IF I PUT A LITTLE MORE FLASH
POWDER INTO THE TRAY.

304
00:14:07,478 --> 00:14:08,979
AND THEN DALTON
COMES BACK TO JOIN.

305
00:14:08,979 --> 00:14:10,447
NOW WE'RE ALL SET,

306
00:14:10,447 --> 00:14:11,815
BUT THEN WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT,
BILL SLIPS OFF.

307
00:14:11,815 --> 00:14:15,953
AND BILL'S THINKIN',
YEAH, YOU GUESSED IT.

308
00:14:15,953 --> 00:14:18,188
