TELL HER THAT EATING
RICE BRINGS BACK BAD

IT WILL BE A DISASTER

95

HOW ABOUT A
HEART/LUNG MACHINE, HUH?

114

THE PERFECT FATHER'S DAY
GIFT THAT KEEPS ON GIVING.

115
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,508
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, WHAT YOU'RE GOING
TO NEED FOR THAT,

116
00:05:09,508 --> 00:05:11,443
YOU GOT TO GO THROUGH
THE PILE AND PICK
OUT ANYTHING

117
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:15,481
THAT YOU CAN USE TO SUCK,
PUMP, COMPRESS
OR BLOW.

118
00:05:18,617 --> 00:05:20,285
ALL RIGHT.
FIRST THING
YOU WANT TO DO

119
00:05:20,285 --> 00:05:23,322
IS LIE YOUR PATIENT
DOWN INSIDE THE FREEZER.

120
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:25,157
THIS GOES DOWN
TO AROUND ZERO,

121
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:27,993
BUT NOT TOO CLOSE OR
THERE'S NO POINT
GOING ANY FARTHER.

122
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:29,995
ALL RIGHT.
NOW YOU WANT TO TAKE
ONE OF THESE WINDSHIELD

123
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:31,697
WASHER UNITS WHICH
BECOMES THE INPUT

124
00:05:31,697 --> 00:05:35,300
TO TAKE THE BLOOD
OUT OF THE VICTIM --
OUT OF THE PATIENT, SORRY.

125
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,403
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
IS YOU WANT TO
HOOK THIS IN

126
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:40,406
TO WHICHEVER ONE
OF HIS ORIFICES GIVES
YOU THE SNUGGEST FIT.

127
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,374
AND THEN OUT OF THE
WINDSHIELD WASHER PUMP

128
00:05:42,374 --> 00:05:45,310
YOU GO INTO
YOUR CARBURETOR.

129
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,479
ALL RIGHT, THIS
IS WHERE THE BLOOD
GETS MIXED WITH OXYGEN.

130
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:49,648
NOW IF IT'S A FAT
GUY, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO GO WITH A FOUR BARREL

131
00:05:49,648 --> 00:05:51,283
AND MAYBE PUT A
SUPER CHARGER ON THERE.

132
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:52,951
ANOTHER GREAT THING
ABOUT THE CARBURETOR UNIT

133
00:05:52,951 --> 00:05:56,555
IS IT'S AN IDEAL PLACE
WHERE YOU CAN ADD MEDICINE
DIRECTLY INTO THE BLOODSTREAM,

134
00:05:56,555 --> 00:06:01,727
BE IT CORTISONE
OR MAYBE A MEDICINAL
ALCOHOL LIKE VERMOUTH.

135
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,695
AND THEN OUT OF THE
CARBURETOR YOU WANT

136
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:05,697
TO GO DIRECTLY
INTO YOUR WATER PUMP.

137
00:06:05,697 --> 00:06:09,501
AND THEN OUT OF
THE WATER PUMP YOU
BLAST THE BLOOD BACK OUT

138
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:12,871
ONE OF THESE RAD HOSES
BACK INTO THE PATIENT.

139
00:06:12,871 --> 00:06:14,673
IT MIGHT BE HARD
FINDING AN ORIFICE
THAT SIZE,

140
00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:16,575
ESPECIALLY
IF HE'S COLD.

141
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,844
ANYWAY, GET ALL THAT
STUFF IN THERE.

142
00:06:18,844 --> 00:06:20,279
THAT TAKES CARE OF THAT.

143
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,847
NOW YOU WANT TO DEAL
WITH THE LUNG PART

144
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:23,348
OF THE HEART/LUNG
MACHINE.

145
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:25,217
OKAY, FOR THAT
YOU WANT TO TAKE
A FUNNEL LIKE THIS,

146
00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:27,386
DUCT TAPE THAT
RIGHT ALL OVER
THE PATIENT'S FACE,

147
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,588
MAYBE PUT SOME PUTTY
IN THERE AND MAKE IT
A REAL GOOD SEAL.

148
00:06:29,588 --> 00:06:32,791
AND THEN YOU HOOK
THE OTHER END OF
THE GARDEN HOSE

149
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:36,195
UP TO ONE OF THE
TAPS ON THE SINK

150
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,729
AND THEN THAT RUNS
INTO THE NOZZLE

151
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:40,365
AND YOU HAVE REPLACED
THE NOZZLE WITH,

152
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:42,634
WELL, LET'S CALL
IT A BALLOON.

153
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:44,102
THAT'S HOOKED UP
TO ANOTHER HOSE

154
00:06:44,102 --> 00:06:46,104
WHICH RUNS DOWN
INTO A COMPRESSOR.

155
00:06:46,104 --> 00:06:47,573
WE HAVEN'T HOOKED
THAT UP YET.

156
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,474
AND WHAT HAPPENS IS
WHEN THE COMPRESSOR
STARTS UP, YOU SEE,

157
00:06:49,474 --> 00:06:52,344
IT PUTS AIR INTO
THE BALLOON AND THEN

158
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:56,515
THAT RELEASES BACK
INTO YOUR PATIENT.

159
00:06:56,515 --> 00:07:00,652
YEAH.
SO I WILL PUT
THAT ALL IN THERE.

160
00:07:00,652 --> 00:07:02,888
TAKE THE HOSE OUT.

161
00:07:02,888 --> 00:07:05,657
HOOK HER UP
INTO OUR COMPRESSOR.

162
00:07:05,657 --> 00:07:09,094
AND, AS YOU CAN SEE,
THE WHOLE UNIT IS

163
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:10,929
ALL DRIVEN BY A
GAS LAWN MOWER,

164
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:12,731
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT ELECTRICITY
CUTTING OUT

165
00:07:12,731 --> 00:07:14,466
IN THE MIDDLE OF
OPEN HEART SURGERY,

166
00:07:14,466 --> 00:07:16,702
WHICH I WOULD
CALL A SETBACK.

167
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,103
OKAY.
SO ANOTHER THING --

168
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:19,805
YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO
ALL YOUR OPERATIONS
OUTSIDE,

169
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:21,239
BECAUSE I'LL TELL
YOU THE GAS FUMES

170
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:23,942
IN ONE OF THEM SMALL
OPERATING THEATRES.

171
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:25,544
SO THERE, YOU'RE
ALL SET TO GO.

172
00:07:25,544 --> 00:07:27,612
ALL YOU GOT TO
DO NOW IS WAIT FOR
THE SURGEON TO SAY,

173
00:07:27,612 --> 00:07:30,349
OKAY, WE'RE READY FOR
THE LIFE SUPPORT
THING TO START.

174
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:33,085
BUT BEFORE I DO THAT,
I JUST WANT TO
REMIND YOU,

175
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,853
IF WOMEN DON'T FIND
YOU HANDSOME,

176
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:36,722
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

177
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:39,491
ALL RIGHT, GET TO WORK
NOW, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,

178
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:41,893
BEGIN LIFE SUPPORT.

179
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:46,164
THERE.

180
00:07:46,164 --> 00:07:51,336
NO, IT CHOKED.

181
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:53,205
HANG ON.
HANG ON.

182
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:56,041
MAYBE IT'S OUT OF GAS.

183
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,609
NO.

184
00:07:58,977 --> 00:08:00,979
Red Green: STAY TUNED
AS THE POSSUM LODGE
HIGHLAND GAMES

185
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:02,948
COMES FLASHING
ACROSS THE STREAM,

186
00:08:02,948 --> 00:08:06,084
AND HAROLD FISHES
FOR THE MEANING OF
LIFE WITH NO BAIT.

187
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:10,422
I WANT TO TALK TO
YOU YOUNG FOLKS THERE

188
00:08:10,422 --> 00:08:13,625
IN THE GENERATION X OR
Y OR WHATEVER IT IS.

189
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,594
ANYWAY, I HEAR A LOT
OF WHINING ABOUT
THE FACT

190
00:08:15,594 --> 00:08:17,963
THAT YOU'RE NOT
BABYBOOMERS AND MAYBE
YOU MISSED OUT ON THE 60S,

191
00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:21,333
BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD HEAR
THE REAL STORY FROM SOMEONE
WHO WAS THERE.

192
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,870
THE 60S WAS NOT
ALL PEACE AND LOVE AND
UNDERSTANDING, BELIEVE ME.

193
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,406
YEAH, THERE WERE SOME
KIDS WHO PRACTICED
FREE LOVE

194
00:08:28,406 --> 00:08:30,976
AND THEN THEY WENT
TO THE FREE CLINIC,

195
00:08:30,976 --> 00:08:32,711
AND SOME OF THEM
TRIED NEW STUFF,

196
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:34,913
THEN THEY HAD THEIR
STOMACHS PUMPED.

197
00:08:34,913 --> 00:08:38,683
AND IT'S TRUE THE 60S
DID INSPIRE SOME REAL
GREAT PROTEST SONGS.

198
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:43,388
BUT WE ALSO HAD THE
PARTRIDGE FAMILY AND
THE 1910 FRUIT GUM COMPANY,

199
00:08:43,388 --> 00:08:45,957
AND THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT
FOR THE FIRST TIME

200
00:08:45,957 --> 00:08:47,759
STARTED TO GET
A FAIR SHAKE ON THAT,

201
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,929
BUT THEY ALSO GOT THEIR
OWN CIGARETTE, BABY.

202
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:52,964
AND, YEAH, I KNOW WE
HAD A QUARTER OF A
MILLION PEOPLE

203
00:08:52,964 --> 00:08:54,466
SHOW UP AT WOODSTOCK
BUT A LOT MORE THAN THAT

204
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:56,868
WENT OVERSEAS
TO FIGHT.

205
00:08:56,868 --> 00:08:59,037
SO THE NEXT TIME SOMEBODY
TRIES TO PUT DOWN YOUR
GENERATION

206
00:08:59,037 --> 00:09:01,740
AND MAKES YOU FEEL BAD
ABOUT MISSING OUT
ON THE 60S,

207
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,544
JUST HUM BACK A FEW
BARS OF YUMMY YUMMY
YUMMY, I GOT LOVE IN MY TUMMY.

208
00:09:08,013 --> 00:09:09,247
WELL, THE DEED IS DONE,

209
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:10,949
THE VACANT LOT
NEXT DOOR IS SOLD.

210
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:13,051
GOOD FOR YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS.

211
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:14,252
WE DIDN'T
BUY IT, HAROLD

212
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:17,155
I KNOW, GOOD FOR YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS.

213
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:18,423
NOT EVERYBODY
FEELS THAT WAY.

214
00:09:18,423 --> 00:09:20,625
MOOSE THOMPSON
AND STINKY PETERSON
ARE SCREAMING AT ME

215
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,327
FOR NOT BUYING THE LOT
WHEN WE HAD THE CHANCE.

216
00:09:22,327 --> 00:09:24,662
I TOLD THEM WE DIDN'T
BUY IT BECAUSE NOBODY
ELSE WANTED IT.

217
00:09:24,662 --> 00:09:27,565
MEN ONLY BUY THINGS
THAT OTHER MEN WANT.

218
00:09:27,565 --> 00:09:29,968
THIS IS SO EXCITING,
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
NEW NEIGHBOURS.

219
00:09:29,968 --> 00:09:31,269
ARE THERE ANY
OTHER TEENAGERS?

220
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:36,574
YOU KNOW, ARE THERE
ANY -- ARE THERE ANY
NON-MALES, YOU KNOW?

221
00:09:36,574 --> 00:09:39,744
YOU KNOW, LIKE BABES?

222
00:09:39,744 --> 00:09:41,379
NO IDEA, HAROLD.

223
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:43,548
THE GUY AT THE LAND
DEED OFFICE SAID IT WAS
BOUGHT BY A NUMBERED COMPANY.

224
00:09:43,548 --> 00:09:45,083
THAT SCARES
ME A LITTLE

225
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,684
BECAUSE WHEN A NUMBERED
COMPANY BUYS A PROPERTY,

226
00:09:46,684 --> 00:09:50,655
IT USUALLY MEANS ITS
LAND DEVELOPERS
OR BAPTISTS.

227
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:52,290
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT
WE SHOULD DO,

228
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,758
WE SHOULD ACT LIKE
THE WELCOME WAGON.

229
00:09:53,758 --> 00:09:55,059
YOU KNOW, WE'LL TAKE
THEM OVER A GIFT

230
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:56,795
AND WE'LL WELCOME
THEM TO POSSUM LAKE

231
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:58,129
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.

232
00:09:58,129 --> 00:09:59,798
THERE'S A BEAN CASSEROLE
DOWN IN THE BOATHOUSE
FRIDGE,

233
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:01,132
THAT WILL
BE PERFECT.

234
00:10:01,132 --> 00:10:02,600
THAT'S NOT
A BEAN CASSEROLE.

235
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,868
THAT'S A PAIL
OF FISH BAIT.

236
00:10:03,868 --> 00:10:05,103
WELL, IF THEY'RE REAL
FISHERMAN THEY'LL
KNOW THAT

237
00:10:05,103 --> 00:10:07,639
AND IF THEY'RE NOT
THEY SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

238
00:10:08,773 --> 00:10:12,977
WHAT YOU ARE WATCHING
COULD HAVE VALUE
SOME DAY.

239
00:10:12,977 --> 00:10:15,446
IT COULD BE AWHILE.

240
00:10:15,446 --> 00:10:19,183
[ HEART MONITOR BEEPING ]
WE'RE LOSING HIM.

241
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:22,487
WELL, AS MOST OF YOU KNOW,
WE'RE AT BRACKSTON'S
MARINA

242
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:23,955
WITH THE OWNER
GLEN BRACKSTON.

243
00:10:23,955 --> 00:10:25,523
HE'S GOT THIS WEEK'S
BOATING TIP FOR US.

244
00:10:25,523 --> 00:10:27,325
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT, FOLKS,

245
00:10:27,325 --> 00:10:28,927
YOU GOT TO TAKE
CARE OF YOUR HEALTH.

246
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:30,495
YOU KNOW, ONCE
THAT SHIP SAILS,

247
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:32,363
SHE DOESN'T COME BACK.

248
00:10:32,363 --> 00:10:34,632
I FOUND THAT OUT
AFTER TWO HEART
ATTACKS.

249
00:10:34,632 --> 00:10:37,368
IS THAT YOUR
BOATING TIP, GLEN?
NO.

250
00:10:37,368 --> 00:10:39,737
THAT'S A LITTLE
LIFE LESSON, RED.
ALL RIGHT.

251
00:10:39,737 --> 00:10:41,606
TODAY'S BOATING
TIP WILL BE

252
00:10:41,606 --> 00:10:44,475
HOW TO PROPERLY MOVE
A BOAT ON A TRAILER.

253
00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:46,711
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
GOING TO BE DOING.
ALL RIGHT.

254
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:49,747
SO, RED, MAYBE YOU
COULD SWING YOUR LEG
OVER THE TONGUE THERE?

255
00:10:49,747 --> 00:10:51,249
DON'T YOU HAVE A
MACHINE TO DO THIS?

256
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:52,884
DON'T YOU HAVE LIKE A
TRUCK OR A TRACTOR

257
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:54,686
OR WHAT ABOUT
YOUR CAR?

258
00:10:54,686 --> 00:10:56,888
NOPE.
ALL GOT REPOED.

259
00:10:56,888 --> 00:10:59,957
OH.
YEAH.
EVERYTHING.

260
00:10:59,957 --> 00:11:02,627
YOU KNOW
THAT NEW GUY THAT
LIVES NEXT DOOR TO YOU?

261
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:04,295
HE'S GOT A LOT
OF NICE STUFF.
REALLY?

262
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:05,697
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

263
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:08,933
HE'S GOT A BACKHOE,
A BOBCAT, A BRUSH HOG,

264
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:10,968
A FRONT-END LOADER,
HE'S GOT IT ALL.
WOW.

265
00:11:10,968 --> 00:11:12,470
YOU SHOULD MAKE
FRIENDS WITH THAT GUY.

266
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,538
YEAH.
I MIGHT.

267
00:11:13,538 --> 00:11:15,406
WELL, THERE'S
A ANOTHER LITTLE
LIFE LESSON, RED,

268
00:11:15,406 --> 00:11:18,609
MAKE FRIENDS WITH PEOPLE
THAT CAN DO SOMETHING
FOR YOU.

269
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:19,744
THERE YOU GO.

270
00:11:19,744 --> 00:11:22,046
OKAY, RED, OL' BUDDY,
DO YOU WANT TO WING
DOWN THERE

271
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:23,748
AND GRAB
THAT THING?

272
00:11:23,748 --> 00:11:25,116
NOW BE CAREFUL,
JUST USE YOUR LEGS,

273
00:11:25,116 --> 00:11:26,584
OKAY, BECAUSE YOU
DON'T WANT TO END UP

274
00:11:26,584 --> 00:11:28,286
GETTING A BAD
BACK LIKE I GOT.

275
00:11:28,286 --> 00:11:32,190
I DON'T WANT A
BAD BACK BUT WOULDN'T
MIND ONE LIKE YOU GOT.

276
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,891
LIFT HER UP THERE.
THAT'S IT.

277
00:11:33,891 --> 00:11:37,428
NOW JUST WALK
AHEAD SLOWLY, RED.

278
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:41,632
SEE, RED.
YEAH?

279
00:11:41,632 --> 00:11:42,900
YOU GOT TO
PAY ATTENTION.

280
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,802
YOU FORGOT TO MOVE
THE ROCK HERE.

281
00:11:44,802 --> 00:11:46,704
YOU CAN'T GO ANYWHERE
WITH THE ROCK THERE.

282
00:11:46,704 --> 00:11:48,473
LET ME GET
IT FOR YOU.
ALL RIGHT.

283
00:11:48,473 --> 00:11:50,775
I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU WERE GOING TO
NOTICE BUT YOU DIDN'T.

284
00:11:50,775 --> 00:11:51,909
THANKS FOR DOING THAT.

285
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:54,145
I HOPE IT'S NOT
TOO MUCH TROUBLE.

286
00:11:54,145 --> 00:11:56,247
OH SORRY, HAROLD.

287
00:11:56,247 --> 00:11:58,549
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
GET UP.

288
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:00,885
OKAY, RED,
LET'S GO.
ALRIGHTY.

289
00:12:00,885 --> 00:12:02,753
JUST STICK HER OVER
BY THE SHED THERE,
WILL YOU RED?

290
00:12:02,753 --> 00:12:04,555
I GOT A GUY
COMING TO RENT IT
A LITTLE WHILE LATER.

291
00:12:04,555 --> 00:12:06,357
WHY DON'T WE PUT
IT IN THE WATER THEN?

292
00:12:06,357 --> 00:12:08,326
I JUST TOOK IT
OUT OF THE WATER, RED.

293
00:12:08,326 --> 00:12:10,294
OH, YEAH, I CAN CLIP
THE GUY FOR ANOTHER
HUNDRED BUCKS OR SO

294
00:12:10,294 --> 00:12:12,330
BY LAUNCHING
HIS BOAT.

295
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,998
YOU GOT TO BE THINKING
IN THIS BUSINESS, RED.

296
00:12:13,998 --> 00:12:15,666
I GUESS THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE DOING SO WELL.

297
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,168
OH YEAH.
YEAH.

298
00:12:17,168 --> 00:12:19,103
USE YOUR BRAIN,
SAVE YOUR MUSCLE.

299
00:12:19,103 --> 00:12:20,671
YOU KNOW, RED,
THERE'S A LOT OF GUYS

300
00:12:20,671 --> 00:12:22,106
WHO WOULD HAVE DONE
THIS BY THEMSELVES.

301
00:12:22,106 --> 00:12:23,908
THAT WOULD BE CRAZY.
OH YEAH.

302
00:12:23,908 --> 00:12:25,943
MUCH EASIER WITH
THE TWO OF US.

303
00:12:25,943 --> 00:12:30,114
[ HEART MONITOR -
STEADY TONE ]

304
00:12:30,114 --> 00:12:35,953
OH BOY.

305
00:12:42,693 --> 00:12:44,428
SORRY.

306
00:12:45,563 --> 00:12:47,698
UNCLE RED, HOW COME
OLDER MEN, SOME OF THEM,

307
00:12:47,698 --> 00:12:49,300
YOU KNOW, THEY LIKE
LEAVE THEIR WIVES

308
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,135
AND START GOING OUT
WITH YOUNGER GIRLS?

309
00:12:51,135 --> 00:12:53,938
BECAUSE THEY CAN.

310
00:12:53,938 --> 00:12:55,106
WHAT?

311
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:56,807
NO, NO, I'M
KIDDING I GUESS.

312
00:12:56,807 --> 00:12:58,242
BUT YOU KNOW IT WORKS
BOTH WAYS, HAROLD,

313
00:12:58,242 --> 00:13:00,211
I HEAR A LOT OF
OLDER WOMEN ARE
LEAVING THEIR HUSBANDS

314
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:02,079
AND GOING OFF
WITH YOUNGER MEN.

315
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,814
MAYBE THERE'S
HOPE FOR YOU.

316
00:13:03,814 --> 00:13:05,416
OH, YEAH.

317
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,785
UNLESS I GET TOO
OLD TO QUALIFY.

318
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:12,156
OH, HAROLD, WITH YOUR
PERSONALITY YOU WON'T
BE ALLOWED TO GET OLD.

319
00:13:12,156 --> 00:13:15,292
I READ AN ARTICLE ABOUT
THESE YOUNGER/OLDER
RELATIONSHIPS,

320
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:17,661
IT WAS CALLED MAY/
DECEMBER ROMANCE.

321
00:13:17,661 --> 00:13:19,864
WHAT DO THEY MEAN
BY THAT, UNCLE RED?

322
00:13:19,864 --> 00:13:21,398
OH, HAROLD, A LOT OF
TIMES WHEN A COUPLE

323
00:13:21,398 --> 00:13:22,900
HAS BEEN MARRIED
A LONG TIME,

324
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,003
THEY ONLY, LET'S SAY,
GET INTIMATE TWICE
A YEAR,

325
00:13:26,003 --> 00:13:27,905
ONCE AT CHRISTMAS
AND ONCE IN THE SPRING

326
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:29,740
WHEN THEY OPEN
UP THE COTTAGE.

327
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,042
ARE YOU A MAY/
DECEMBER KIND
OF PERSON?

328
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:34,745
WELL, THAT'S A
LITTLE PERSONAL
I THINK, HAROLD.

329
00:13:34,745 --> 00:13:37,948
BUT I CAN ANSWER YOU
I THINK DISCREETLY
WITH TWO WORDS,

330
00:13:37,948 --> 00:13:41,285
LONG WEEKENDS.

331
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:46,190
ALL RIGHT.
LONG WEEKEND.

332
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,691
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

333
00:13:48,993 --> 00:13:50,895
Red Green: TIME FOR THE
POSSUM LODGE HIGHLAND GAMES

334
00:13:50,895 --> 00:13:53,831
ON THIS WEEKS
ADVENTURES WITH BILL.

335
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:56,300
OH BOY.
WOW.

336
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:01,906
I GUESS THIS WOULD BE
THE OPENING CEREMONIES.

337
00:14:01,906 --> 00:14:03,908
SOME GUYS WEAR
THEIR HEART ON
THEIR SLEEVE, NOT BILL.

338
00:14:03,908 --> 00:14:05,109
ALL RIGHT.

339
00:14:05,109 --> 00:14:07,711
NOW THIS IS MY
OPENING CEREMONIES.

340
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:09,113
SORRY, BILL.

341
00:14:09,113 --> 00:14:10,414
WHAT HE'S SHOWING
YOU HERE --

342
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:11,916
MOST OF YOU DON'T
KNOW THE HIGHLAND GAMES

343
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,417
OF COURSE COME
FROM SCOTLAND.

344
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:17,922
THIS IS A
LITTLE EVENT THEY HAVE
CALLED TOSSING THE CABER,

345
00:14:17,922 --> 00:14:19,623
NOT TO BE CONFUSED
WITH TOSSING THE COOKIES

346
00:14:19,623 --> 00:14:21,425
WHICH WE DO A LOT
OF AT THE LODGE.

347
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:23,394
AND BILL THIS IS VERY --
WHAT BILL?

348
00:14:23,394 --> 00:14:25,729
NO, NO, NO.

349
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:35,706
NO, NO, NO.

350
00:14:35,706 --> 00:14:38,575
SO I PUT THE BUNGIE CORD,
ONE OF THE OTHER
SECRET WEAPONS

351
00:14:38,575 --> 00:14:40,411
AT THE LODGE,
AROUND THERE.

352
00:14:40,411 --> 00:14:41,645
THAT WILL HELP.
THAT WILL HELP.

353
00:14:41,645 --> 00:14:43,180
I THINK THAT WILL
HELP A LOT.

354
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,948
THAT SHOULD KEEP
IT RIGHT --
THERE WE GO.

355
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:49,687
THERE WE GO.
THERE WE GO.

356
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:50,888
NO.

357
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:53,691
DROPPED THAT DOWN, BILL,
THERE'S A TRAIN COMING.

358
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:55,993
THAT A BOY.

359
00:14:55,993 --> 00:14:59,763
ALL RIGHT.
I THOUGHT THIS TIME IF
I CAN HELP HIM BALANCE IT,

360
00:14:59,763 --> 00:15:01,665
MAYBE GIVE HIM A LITTLE
PUSH, YOU KNOW,

361
00:15:01,665 --> 00:15:03,901
GET HIM GOING IN
THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
THERE THAT LOOKS BETTER.

362
00:15:03,901 --> 00:15:05,302
OH, THE SIGN.

363
00:15:05,302 --> 00:15:07,037
OH.

364
00:15:07,037 --> 00:15:10,040
YOU KNOW THERE'S
A LOT MORE TO THIS
THAN MEETS THE EYE.

365
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,009
MAYBE IF HE HAD PANTS ON.

366
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:14,445
WHERE DID THAT GO?

367
00:15:14,445 --> 00:15:15,746
END OVER END.

368
00:15:15,746 --> 00:15:18,949
BILL, BILL, I THINK
IT'S BEHIND YOU,
BILL, OH YEAH.

369
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:20,350
THAT'S GOING WELL.

370
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,453
I SEE WHY SCOTLAND
DOESN'T RULE THE WORLD.

371
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:23,954
THAT'S A LITTLE
HORIZONTAL, BILL.

372
00:15:23,954 --> 00:15:26,323
OH.

373
00:15:27,825 --> 00:15:30,494
WELL NOW YOU REALIZE
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
SCOTTISH TO DO THIS,

374
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:33,096
YOU JUST GOT
TO BE ANGRY.

375
00:15:33,096 --> 00:15:34,731
I'LL TAKE IT OUT THERE.

376
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:36,366
I THINK ABOUT WHERE
I WOULD LIKE TO
TOSS THE CABER,

377
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:39,636
BUT INSTEAD OF THAT
I THROW HER UP
INTO THE AIR.

378
00:15:39,636 --> 00:15:41,572
LET HER GO, RED.

379
00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:43,674
OH, THAT'S A BEAUTY.
THAT IS A BEAUTY.

380
00:15:43,674 --> 00:15:45,342
IT'S OVER HERE, BILL.

381
00:15:45,342 --> 00:15:46,944
OH BOY.

382
00:15:46,944 --> 00:15:48,912
AND OF COURSE FOR THE
CLOSING CEREMONIES,

383
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:52,382
THEY HAVE THE TRADITIONAL
HIGHLAND DANCING.

384
00:15:56,787 --> 00:15:58,222
Red Green: COMING UP,
DALTON HUMPHRIES

385
00:15:58,222 --> 00:16:00,190
IS GOING TO SHOW
US SOME VALUABLE
ANTIQUES

386
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:04,962
AND YOU CAN LEARN SUCCESS
FROM MR. SUCK-CESS,
WINSTON ROTHCHILD.

387
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:09,533
WELL, THIS GOOF WHO
BOUGHT THE LOT
NEXT DOOR

388
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:11,735
IS DEFINITELY NOT
ONE OF THE GUYS.

389
00:16:11,735 --> 00:16:13,036
BUT YOU MET HIM.

390
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:15,339
YOU LIKED HIS BACKHOE
AND HIS BOBCAT AND
HIS BULLDOZER.

391
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:18,675
HAROLD, YOU CAN'T
JUDGE A MAN BY
HIS EQUIPMENT.

392
00:16:18,675 --> 00:16:21,211
HE USED ALL THAT STUFF
TO CLEAN UP THE LOT.

393
00:16:21,211 --> 00:16:23,080
THE NERVE.

394
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,849
HE GOT ALL THE TRUCKS IN
THERE AND HAULED AWAY
ALL THE RUSTED JUNK.

395
00:16:25,849 --> 00:16:28,952
OUR ENTIRE
PARTS DEPARTMENT
UP AND HAULED AWAY.

396
00:16:28,952 --> 00:16:31,722
I KNOW THERE
WERE TWO GREAT
SNOW TIRES IN THERE.

397
00:16:31,722 --> 00:16:34,057
I'LL TELL YOU, WHEN
HE TOWED AWAY THAT
'74 TORINO

398
00:16:34,057 --> 00:16:36,460
WITH THE LAND ROOF
HANGING DOWN THE SIDE,

399
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,763
THERE WASN'T A DRY
EYE IN THE LODGE.

400
00:16:39,763 --> 00:16:41,431
AND THEN HE HOOKED
UP A BRUSH HOG

401
00:16:41,431 --> 00:16:43,800
AND USED THAT TO REMOVE
EVERY PIECE OF SCRUB.

402
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,068
YEAH, SURE, HE'S
GOT A GREAT VIEW

403
00:16:45,068 --> 00:16:47,204
BUT HE'S TAKEN AWAY
EVERYTHING WORTH
LOOKING AT.

404
00:16:47,204 --> 00:16:48,872
WELL, UNCLE RED,
IT'S HIS PROPERTY NOW.

405
00:16:48,872 --> 00:16:50,140
HE CAN DO WHAT
HE WANTS WITH IT.

406
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,541
BUT THERE ARE COMMUNITY
STANDARDS, HAROLD.

407
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:52,642
IS HE GOING TO
BUILD A NICE HOUSE?

408
00:16:52,642 --> 00:16:54,111
IS HE GOING TO CUT
THE GRASS EVERY WEEK?

409
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:55,946
IS HE GOING TO
LANDSCAPE THE
PROPERTY?

410
00:16:55,946 --> 00:16:58,815
AND, IF SO, HOW DO
WE TO STOP HIM?

411
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:02,919
Red Green: WE'RE OUT
HERE BY THE MAIN HIGHWAY
AT HUMPHRIES EVERYTHING STORE

412
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:06,022
TO GET ANOTHER SLANT
ON THESE CITY PEOPLE
MOVING UP TO THE COUNTRY.

413
00:17:06,022 --> 00:17:08,291
AND HERE'S
OUR RESIDENT
ANTIQUE SPECIALIST,

414
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,760
DALTON HUMPHREY.

415
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,195
I'M A LIFESTYLE
RECYCLER.

416
00:17:12,195 --> 00:17:13,964
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THESE URBAN REFUGEES

417
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:15,365
MOVING UP
HERE, DALTON?

418
00:17:15,365 --> 00:17:17,067
YOU KNOW, I SAY GOD
BLESS THEM, YOU KNOW,

419
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:18,368
BECAUSE, RED, THE
FIRST THING THEY DO

420
00:17:18,368 --> 00:17:20,036
AFTER THEY PUT IN
THEIR SATELLITE DISH

421
00:17:20,036 --> 00:17:22,973
IS FILL THEIR COUNTRY
HOMES WITH RUSTY PLATES,

422
00:17:22,973 --> 00:17:26,676
BROKEN CHAIRS AND
OLD PHONES THAT
DON'T WORK.

423
00:17:26,676 --> 00:17:28,278
ANTIQUES?

424
00:17:28,278 --> 00:17:30,380
BINGO.

425
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,983
YEAH, I GOT THESE
ANTIQUE MAGAZINES HERE.

426
00:17:32,983 --> 00:17:34,985
WELL, NO,
THOSE ARE A GOOD
INVESTMENT, RED.

427
00:17:34,985 --> 00:17:37,020
REALLY?
THEY'RE FULL OF ANTIQUES.

428
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,755
YEAH, WELL, ANTIQUES
ARE NEVER OLD NEWS.

429
00:17:38,755 --> 00:17:40,891
NOW, YOU GET
A NEWS MAGAZINE,

430
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:42,993
IT'S NOT WORTH
ANYTHING A WEEK LATER.

431
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:44,294
GOOD POINT.
SURE.

432
00:17:44,294 --> 00:17:45,729
LOOK WHAT THEY
GOT FOR SALE HERE.

433
00:17:45,729 --> 00:17:49,266
PARTIALLY RESTORED
CARRIAGE HOUSE,
CIRCA 1840.

434
00:17:49,266 --> 00:17:52,669
NO, YOU HAVE TO WATCH
THE LANGUAGE IN THOSE
ADS, RED.

435
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:56,573
PARTIALLY RESTORED THAT MEANS
IT'S AN UNSALVAGEABLE
MONEY PIT

436
00:17:56,573 --> 00:17:58,275
AND THE OWNER
IS BAILING OUT.

437
00:17:58,275 --> 00:18:00,977
CIRCA 1840,
WELL SEE THAT WAS
PRE-BUILDING CODE.

438
00:18:00,977 --> 00:18:02,979
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO FIND A LOT OF
GREAT PLUMBING

439
00:18:02,979 --> 00:18:05,382
AND ELECTRICAL
WORK BACK THEN.

440
00:18:05,382 --> 00:18:07,751
I GUESS THAT'S WHY
THIS GUY WHO BOUGHT
NEXT TO POSSUM LODGE

441
00:18:07,751 --> 00:18:09,519
IS BUILDING
HIS OWN HOUSE.

442
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:10,954
YEAH.
YEAH.

443
00:18:10,954 --> 00:18:12,656
AND IN THE PROCESS
RAISING VALUES
OF PROPERTY

444
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:15,625
ALL OVER THE AREA,
EVEN POSSUM LODGE.

IT SOMEWHERE.

IT'S FROM A PERSON.

459
00:18:45,622 --> 00:18:48,892
DEAR EXPERTS,
I HAVE A L
PRACTICE IN TORONTO

460
00:18:48,892 --> 00:18:50,560
AND MY DAUGHTER
IS ALSO A LAWYER.

461
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,196
I HAVE ALWAYS
ENCOURAGED HER TO
STRIVE TO BE THE BEST

462
00:18:53,196 --> 00:18:54,898
BUT SHE IS NOW DOING
BETTER THAN I AM

463
00:18:54,898 --> 00:18:57,167
AND I'M HAVING TROUBLE
DEALING WITH THAT.

464
00:18:57,167 --> 00:19:00,136
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO?

465
00:19:00,136 --> 00:19:03,106
OH, YOU KNOW, I'VE
WAITED MY WHOLE LIFE
TO GIVE ADVICE TO LAWYERS,

466
00:19:03,106 --> 00:19:05,909
BUT THIS ONE HAS
GOT ME STUMPED.

WELL, I DON'T KNOW,
LET'S TAKE IT

469
00:19:09,345 --> 00:19:11,080
FROM THE DAUGHTER'S SIDE
OF THE POINT OF VIEW

470
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,183
OF THE PERSPECTIVE
OF THING, EH?

471
00:19:13,183 --> 00:19:16,119
THIS TO ME SOUNDS
LIKE A CLASSIC CASE

472
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:19,656
OF YOUR POT CALLING
THE KETTLE BACK.

473
00:19:19,656 --> 00:19:23,993
SO WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING IS THAT MAYBE SHE'S
NOT TRYING TO SURPASS HIM,

474
00:19:23,993 --> 00:19:27,197
MAYBE HE'S JUST LIKE,
YOU KNOW, A LOUSY LAWYER.

475
00:19:27,197 --> 00:19:32,569
OH, OH, LIKE THAT
DISTRICT ATTORNEY
ON THE PERRY MASON SHOW.

476
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:35,972
THAT GUY -- THAT GUY
NEVER WON A CASE
EVER NEVER.

WELL, YOU KNOW, AT
LEAST NOT ONES THEY
TELEVISED, YOU KNOW.

478
00:19:38,975 --> 00:19:41,110
HE MUST HAVE WON SOME
THAT THEY DIDN'T SHOW

479
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:45,415
BECAUSE HE WAS ON
THAT PROGRAM FOR
LIKE 12 SEASONS

HIS NAME, HAMILTON BURGER.

YOU KNOW, THAT
GUY REMINDED ME

483
00:20:00,396 --> 00:20:02,665
A LOT OF MY
OLD MAN, EH?

484
00:20:02,665 --> 00:20:05,168
OH, YEAH, BECAUSE MY
DAD WAS ALWAYS WINNING

485
00:20:05,168 --> 00:20:07,537
AND I WAS ALWAYS
HAMBURGER, EH?

486

I'LL NEVER FORGET,
YOU KNOW,

487
00:20:09,072 --> 00:20:10,640
HE USED TO SAY
THINGS TO ME LIKE,

488
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,811
HEY, WINSTON,
YOU'RE USELESS.

489
00:20:14,811 --> 00:20:17,447
I'M SURE
HE WAS PROBABLY
KIDDING, YOU KNOW.

490
00:20:17,447 --> 00:20:19,682
YEAH, IT'S JUST LIKE
WHEN UNCLE RED CALLS
ME DOUGH HEAD.

SOMETHING, IT WAS
GOOD FOR ME.

UP BY THE BOOT LICKERS.

DO I GET OFF THE POT, EH?

DO THE SAME THING

UP THE LODGE,

THE LOT NEXT
DOOR GOES UP
