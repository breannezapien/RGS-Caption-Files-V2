1
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:04,104
AT ANY OF OUR BIG
FAMILY DINNERS,

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:06,473
IT'S KIND OF LIKE GOING
TO A KARAOKE BAR.

3
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:09,843
YOU NEVER KNOW WHETHER
YOU'RE GOING TO GET
A TURKEY OR A HAM.

4
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:14,180
SO I SAY, WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT
IF YOU COULD COOK BOTH?

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,717
NOW YOU MAY THINK YOU NEED
TO HAVE TWO OVENS TO DO THAT.

6
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:20,854
MAN, ARE YOU EVER WRONG.

7
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,623
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU DON'T
REALIZE THERE'S A BURNER

8
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:25,759
IN THE BOTTOM
OF THE DISHWASHER.

9
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:27,660
NOW, IT'S THERE
TO DRY DISHES,

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,463
BUT WE'RE GOING TO USE IT
TO COOK OUR TURKEY.

11
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:33,299
IN FACT, WE'RE SO CLOSE
TO THE BURNER,

12
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:37,070
WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE TOAST
AT THE SAME TIME.

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,010
NOW, THE OTHER SHELF
IS FOR THE POTATOES.

14
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:47,981
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
A FULL SLATE OF VEGETABLES.

15
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,482
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

16
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:51,451
AND WE CAN KEEP THEM
COMPLETELY SEPARATE

17
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:54,554
IN THE SILVERWARE HOLDER.

18
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,390
AND HERE'S A BONUS
THAT NO OVEN COULD EVER DO.

19
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,958
YOU KNOW HOW YOUR DISHWASHER

20
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,760
HAS A PUMP AND A
SPRINKLER SYSTEM,

21
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,462
TO PICK UP THE WATER
FROM THE BOTTOM

22
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,163
AND THEN SQUIRTS IT
ALL OVER THE DISHES?

23
00:01:04,163 --> 00:01:07,033
WELL, IT'LL DO THE
SAME THING WITH GRAVY.

24
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:15,241
NOW ALL WE DO IS SET
THE CONTROL TO DRY,

25
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,210
WHICH TURNS ON THE ELEMENT.

26
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,113
YOU KNOW, SOME TIMES
I EVEN AMAZE MYSELF.

27
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,152
OKAY, EVERYTHING'S
DONE PERFECTLY.

28
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:30,523
NOW ALL'S WE DO IS RUN
THE REGULAR DISHWASHING CYCLE.

29
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:33,793
IT'S NOT JUST AN OVEN,

30
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:36,529
IT'S SELF-CLEANING.

31
00:01:38,197 --> 00:01:43,870
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

32
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,541
ALL RIGHT.

33
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,877
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

34
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:53,279
NO, NO.
APPRECIATE IT.

35
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:56,883
BIG, BIG WEEK UP AT
THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

36
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:59,318
WE JUST WON THE POSSUM LAKE
FISHING DERBY.

37
00:01:59,318 --> 00:02:01,120
WE'VE NEVER
DONE THAT BEFORE.

38
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,955
USUALLY THE GUYS
AT CARIBOU LODGE BEAT US

39
00:02:02,955 --> 00:02:05,058
WITH SOME
UNDERHANDED TRICK,

40
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,260
BUT THEY DIDN'T DO
SO WELL THIS YEAR

41
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,329
BECAUSE NONE OF
THEIR OUTBOARDS WOULD RUN.

42
00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:15,368
YEAH, I HEARD SOMEBODY POURED
SUGAR INTO THEIR GAS TANKS.

43
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,405
VICTORY IS SWEET.

44
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,475
OH, UNCLE RED,
WAIT UNTIL YOU HEAR THIS!

[ APPLAUSE ]

46
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,449
WHAT HAPPENED?

47
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,218
DID YOU GET A SCHOLARSHIP
TO BALLET SCHOOL?

48
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,620
NO, I DID NOT, NO.

49
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,690
WE'VE BEEN CHALLENGED
TO A FISHING DERBY
BY ANOTHER LODGE.

50
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,792
THE GRAND PRIZE
IS 10,000 DOLLARS.

51
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,127
HOLY COW.

52
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:44,297
BOY, WE COULD REALLY
FIX THIS PLACE UP WITH
10,000 BUCKS.

53
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:47,500
YOU COULD JUST TEAR IT
DOWN AND START ALL OVER.

54
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,002
WELL, HAROLD,
AND LOSE THE HISTORY,

55
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:51,971
THE MEMORIES
AND THE AMBIENCE?

56
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:54,607
HOPEFULLY.

57
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:57,276
WELL, WHO'S THIS LODGE
THAT THINKS THEY CAN
TAKE US ON, HAROLD?

58
00:02:57,276 --> 00:02:59,779
IT'S, UM, BADGER LODGE.

59
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,747
NO, NO!
WHAT?

60
00:03:01,747 --> 00:03:04,083
NO. NO, YEAH.
OKAY.

61
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,185
BADGER LODGE,
THEY'RE AMERICANS.

62
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:08,020
WELL, WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES THAT MAKE?

63
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,556
WELL, THE AMERICANS
ARE BEST AT EVERYTHING.

SAYS WHO?
THEY DO.

65
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:16,195
YOU KNOW, UNCLE RED,
THEY SPEND MORE ON
FISHING GEAR

66
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:19,131
THAN WE DO ON MISSILES.

67
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:22,601
HAROLD, YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE JUST PEOPLE.

68
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:23,869
THEY DON'T KNOW
POSSUM LAKE;

69

THEY DON'T KNOW
CANADIAN FISH;

AND THEY
DON'T KNOW US.

71
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,407
WE CAN'T BEAT THE ODDS.

72
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:31,310
I MEAN, CALIFORNIA HAS THE
SAME POPULATION AS CANADA.

YEAH, BUT THEY'RE
CALIFORNIANS.

YOU BRING 'EM UP
HERE IN FEBRUARY,

NO, UNCLE RED,

THEY HAVE
10 TIMES EVERYTHING...

10 TIMES THE ECONOMY.

GOT 10 HAROLDS.

SHE'S THE BEST,

SEES YOUR PARENTS

130
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,525
THROTTLE
STICKS A BIT.

131
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,126
YEAH,
I CAN SEE THAT.

00:06:01,126 --> 00:06:03,362
I THINK I HIT
YOUR DOGHOUSE.

133
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,763
HE'S LONG GONE
ANYHOW.

134
00:06:04,763 --> 00:06:07,332
SO I THOUGHT WE'D
TALK A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT THE SHOW.

135
00:06:07,332 --> 00:06:08,600
WE GOT SOME CLIPS.

00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,802
I THOUGHT
WE'D RUN THEM

137
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,069
AND THEN YOU CAN TELL US
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

138
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:13,105
FIRE IT UP.
ALL RIGHT.

139
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:15,440

I'M REAL EXCITED,

140
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,075
I'M HEADING
TO FISH LAKE LODGE,

YOU LOOK EXCITED
THERE, YEAH.

THERE'S BRENDA, MY SLED.

145
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:23,248

BRENDA'S A SLED, OKAY.

146
00:06:23,248 --> 00:06:24,550
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

147
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,486
YOU, KIND OF, JAZZED BRENDA
UP A LITTLE BIT, DIDN'T YOU?

148
00:06:27,486 --> 00:06:30,122
Blair: YEAH, YOU SEE,

149
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:31,990
IS A REAL FANCY PLACE,

150
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,325
AND I SOUPED HER UP A BIT

151
00:06:33,325 --> 00:06:36,828
'CAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO
PULL IN THERE LOOKING
LIKE A GOOF.

152
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,831
Red:
NOW, WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

153
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:41,266
IS THIS A SETBACK
OF SOME KIND?

154
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:43,502

I FAILED TO NOTICE
THAT THE BROCHURE SAID,

SO THE FERRY BOAT WOULDN'T
TAKE THE SNOWMOBILE?

158
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:52,578
Blair:
NO FERRY, RED.

159
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,747
JUST ME, BRENDA
AND THE OPEN WATER.

160
00:06:56,615 --> 00:06:59,718
Red:
WOW. HOLY COW.

161
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:03,655
NOW, DID YOU GET ENOUGH
SPEED UP THERE, BLAIR?

162
00:07:03,655 --> 00:07:05,857
Blair:
APPARENTLY NOT.

163
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:13,498
[ APPLAUSE ]

164
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,369
YOU HEAR A LOT OF TALK
ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING,

165
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:19,404
WHICH IS MELTING
THE POLAR ICE CAP,

166
00:07:19,404 --> 00:07:21,073
WHICH WILL LEAD TO
WORLD-WIDE FLOODING

167
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:23,041
AND MASS EXTINCTIONS
AND SO ON.

168
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,376
BUT WHAT REALLY BUGS ME

169
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:25,977
IS HOW HOT THE SUMMERS
ARE GETTING.

170
00:07:25,977 --> 00:07:29,381
OH SURE, YOU CAN PUT ONE OF
THESE WINDOWS SHAKERS
INTO YOUR HOME

171
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:31,216
IF THINGS ARE GETTING
TOO HOT IN THE BEDROOM.

172
00:07:31,216 --> 00:07:32,651
NICE PROBLEM.

173
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:35,320
WHAT IF YOUR CAR DOESN'T
HAVE AIR CONDITIONING?

174
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,389
OKAY, YOU CAN KEEP COOL
THROUGH EVAPORATION,

175
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:39,024
WHERE YOU OPEN
ALL THE CAR WINDOWS,

176
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:41,193
GET NAKED AND DOUSE
YOURSELF WITH ALCOHOL.

177
00:07:41,193 --> 00:07:43,895
BUT THE COPS NEVER
BELIEVE THAT STORY.

178
00:07:43,895 --> 00:07:46,164
MIND YOU, YOU DO END UP
IN THE COOLER.

179
00:07:46,164 --> 00:07:47,732
SO TO AVOID JAIL,

180
00:07:47,732 --> 00:07:49,468
I SUGGEST A
DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY.

181
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:50,936
YOU WANT TO
PUT OUT THE HEAT,

182
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:53,305
TRY A FIRE EXTINGUISHER.

183
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:57,142
MAKE SURE YOU GET THE KIND
THAT SHOOTS OUT Co2,

184
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:58,977
NOT THE KIND
THAT SHOOTS OUT FOAM.

185
00:07:58,977 --> 00:08:02,280
THEY'RE FOR SHAVING
WHILE YOU'RE WAITING
FOR THE FIRE TRUCK.

186
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,883
THESE Co2 UNITS
PUT OUT STUFF

187
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:07,586
THAT'S ABOUT
3000 DEGREES BELOW ZERO.

188
00:08:07,586 --> 00:08:09,421
WATCH HOW THIS COOLS
SOMETHING DOWN.

189
00:08:09,421 --> 00:08:11,456
YOU WON'T BELIEVE
HOW THE TEMPERATURE DROPS.

190
00:08:18,663 --> 00:08:20,532
NOW, THE REAL PROBLEM
IN A VEHICLE

191
00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:22,934
IS THE SUN BEATING DOWN
ON THE UPHOLSTERY

192
00:08:22,934 --> 00:08:25,604
UNTIL IT GETS HOT ENOUGH
TO FRY EGGS ON.

193
00:08:25,604 --> 00:08:27,072
AND IF YOU'VE EVER
FRIED YOUR EGGS,

194
00:08:27,072 --> 00:08:29,908
YOU KNOW HOW
PAINFUL THAT IS.

195
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:31,710
YOU DON'T HAVE TO COOL
THE WHOLE CAR,

196
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,079
JUST THE SEATS.

197
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:35,947
MOUNT ONE FULL
FIRE EXTINGUISHER

198
00:08:35,947 --> 00:08:37,849
ON EACH SIDE
OF THE BACK SEAT.

199
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:41,286
I'M GUESSING YOU DON'T USE
YOUR BACK SEAT ANYMORE EITHER.

200
00:08:41,286 --> 00:08:44,322
WOW, I'M FINALLY USING
THE SEAT BELTS ON THIS CAR.

201
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,466
OKAY, THAT WENT WELL.

202
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:55,567
THIS IS THE
EMERGENCY BRAKE --

203
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:58,503
SORRY, THIS WAS
THE EMERGENCY BRAKE.

204
00:08:58,503 --> 00:09:01,172
NOW, I KNOW THAT'S GOING
TO ALARM A BUNCH OF YOU
NERVOUS NELLIES,

205
00:09:01,172 --> 00:09:02,474
BUT WHEN
I THINK ABOUT IT,

206
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:04,876
HOW OFTEN DO I USE
MY EMERGENCY BRAKE?

207
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:07,746
ONCE, MAYBE TWICE A MONTH.

208
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:09,948
WHEREAS I BURN MYSELF
ON THE UPHOLSTERY

209
00:09:09,948 --> 00:09:12,017
THREE OR FOUR
TIMES A DAY.

210
00:09:12,017 --> 00:09:14,886
YOU TELL ME WHICH
IS THE REAL EMERGENCY.

211
00:09:14,886 --> 00:09:18,757
NOW, WITH MY CUSTOM
CARBON DIOXIDE-POWERED
AIR CONDITIONERS,

212
00:09:18,757 --> 00:09:21,659
I CAN DRIVE ALL DAY WITHOUT
BEING IN THE HOT SEAT.

213
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:23,928
NOT UNTIL
I GET HOME ANYWAY.

214
00:09:26,398 --> 00:09:29,033
NOW, YOU WANT TO ATTACH
THE OTHER END OF THE CABLE

215
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:31,870
AROUND THE NOZZLES
OF THE FIRE EXTINGUISHERS.

216
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,972
IF YOUR BRAKE CABLE
IS TOO SHORT,

217
00:09:33,972 --> 00:09:36,674
USE SOME OF THE WIRING
FROM THE TAIL LIGHTS.

218
00:09:36,674 --> 00:09:39,010
IF OTHER DRIVERS CAN SEE
THAT YOUR TAIL LIGHTS
AREN'T WORKING,

219
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,746
HEY, THEY'RE
FOLLOWING TOO CLOSE.

220
00:09:44,215 --> 00:09:45,950
OKAY, AND THE TANKS
ARE ALL HOOKED UP.

221
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,120
NOW LET'S JUST IMAGINE THAT
THE CAR'S JUST SITTING
OUT FOR HOURS,

222
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,122
AND THE UPHOLSTERY'S
HOTTER THAN STINK.

223
00:09:51,122 --> 00:09:53,291
AND STINK CAN BE
VERY, VERY HOT.

224
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,293
BUT WATCH THIS.

225
00:10:00,698 --> 00:10:02,133
OH, BABY.

226
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:04,969
HOW COOL IS THAT, EH?

227
00:10:05,837 --> 00:10:07,572
I'M GOOD TO GO.

228
00:10:07,572 --> 00:10:09,841
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME --

229
00:10:20,718 --> 00:10:24,756
[shivering] THEY SHOULD
AT LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

230
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:37,969
FIRE!

231
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:39,938
F-F-FIRE!

232
00:10:56,621 --> 00:10:58,256
I WANT TO TALK
TO ANY COUPLES

233
00:10:58,256 --> 00:10:59,791
WHO HAVE BEEN MARRIED
FOR A WHILE.

234
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,025
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN,

235
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:02,760
THERE WERE
THREE KINDS OF CARS.

236
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,395
FIRST, THERE WAS
THE CLUNKER.

237
00:11:04,395 --> 00:11:06,264
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BEATER,
THE PIECE OF CRAP,

238
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:08,066
THE CAR THAT
LOOKED WORTHLESS

239
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:10,234
AND PERFORMED DOWN
TO THAT STANDARD.

240
00:11:10,234 --> 00:11:11,769
THEN THERE WAS
THE HOT CAR.

241
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:13,004
THE CORVETTE, THE MUSTANG,

242
00:11:13,004 --> 00:11:14,305
YOU KNOW,
THE SPORTS CAR.

243
00:11:14,305 --> 00:11:17,175
IT LOOKED GOOD
AND DELIVERED ON THE PROMISE.

244
00:11:17,175 --> 00:11:18,910
THEN THERE
WAS MY FAVOURITE,

245
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,778
THE SLEEPER.

246
00:11:20,778 --> 00:11:22,413
THE CAR THAT LOOKED
LIKE A CLUNKER,

247
00:11:22,413 --> 00:11:24,682
BUT PERFORMED
LIKE A HOT ROD.

248
00:11:24,682 --> 00:11:26,851
NOW, I KNOW THAT
ON YOUR WEDDING DAY,

249
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:30,388
YOU THOUGHT EACH OTHER
LOOKED LIKE A PRETTY
SPORTY MODEL.

250
00:11:30,388 --> 00:11:33,057
AND WHEN YOU LOOK
AT EACH OTHER NOW,

251
00:11:33,057 --> 00:11:35,927
YOU LOOK LIKE A COUPLE
OF CLUNKERS,

252
00:11:35,927 --> 00:11:39,797
WITH A BAD SHIMMY
IN THE REAR END.

253
00:11:39,797 --> 00:11:42,533
BUT THAT'S ALL ATTITUDE.

254
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:44,469
MAYBE YOU CAN'T BE
A SPORTS CAR,

255
00:11:44,469 --> 00:11:46,404
BUT YOU DON'T NEED
TO BE A CLUNKER,

256
00:11:46,404 --> 00:11:48,806
YOU CAN BE A SLEEPER.

257
00:11:48,806 --> 00:11:51,442
SURE, YOUR TIRES ARE BALD
AND YOUR FENDERS ARE WRINKLED,

258
00:11:51,442 --> 00:11:54,745
BUT YOU MIGHT STILL HAVE
A SURPRISE OR TWO
UNDER THE HOOD.

259
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:56,547
'CAUSE WHEN
I SAY SLEEPER,

260
00:11:56,547 --> 00:11:58,115
I'M ONLY TALKING
FIGURATIVELY.

261
00:11:58,115 --> 00:11:59,650
IF YOU'RE A SLEEPER,
LITERALLY,

262
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,253
YOUR MARRIAGE IS
IN SERIOUS TROUBLE.

263
00:12:02,253 --> 00:12:06,057
YOU GOT TO KEEP YOUR END UP,
FIGURATIVELY AND LITERALLY.

264
00:12:06,057 --> 00:12:07,792
REMEMBER,
I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

265
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:09,861
WE'RE ALL IN
THIS TOGETHER.

266
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:14,465
announcer:
YOU'VE SEEN HIM ON THE ROAD.

267
00:12:14,465 --> 00:12:15,967
YOU'VE HAD HIM IN YOUR YARD.

268
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:17,969
YOU'VE WHIFFED HIM
ON THE BREEZE.

269
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:21,339
NOW, LET WORLD-RENOWNED SEWAGE
SUCKER, WINSTON ROTHSCHILD

270
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:24,442
INTO YOUR HEART
AND ONTO YOUR TURNTABLE

271
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:27,645
WITH HIS FIRST EVER
LONG PLAYING ALBUM.

272
00:12:27,645 --> 00:12:31,749
YES, IT'S WINSTON ROTHCHILD'S
THE SOUNDS OF SUCKING.

273
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:34,619
24 OF THE GREATEST SONGS
EVER WRITTEN

274
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:36,020
SUNG AND INTERPRETED

275
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,724
AS ONLY A MAN WITH NO
PROFESSIONAL TRAINING CAN.

276
00:12:39,724 --> 00:12:41,559
YOU'LL GET...

277
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:36,480
THE POPULATION
OF A COUNTRY

278
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,681
DOESN'T MAKE ANY
DIFFERENCE, HAROLD.

279
00:13:37,681 --> 00:13:39,283
YOU ONLY HAVE FIVE GUYS
ON A FISHING TEAM.

280
00:13:39,283 --> 00:13:40,818
IF THEY'VE GOT
300 MILLION MORE,

281
00:13:40,818 --> 00:13:43,020
THEY ALL HAVE TO SIT
ON THE BENCH.

282
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,855
YES, BUT, SEE, WE MAKE UP
OUR TEAM BY PICKING

283
00:13:44,855 --> 00:13:46,991
FIVE OUT OF,
SAY, OH, 100.

284
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:48,492
THEY MAKE UP
THEIR TEAM BY PICKING

285
00:13:48,492 --> 00:13:50,594
FIVE OUT OF,
SAY, OH, 10,000.

286
00:13:50,594 --> 00:13:52,329
I'M SURE YOU SEE
THE DIFFERENCE.

287
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:54,732
YEAH, IT'LL TAKE
THEM FOREVER.

288
00:13:54,732 --> 00:13:56,834
HAROLD, WE GOT
THE BEST TEAM.

289
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:58,769
I DON'T CARE IF THIS
LODGE IS FROM MARS.

290
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:00,271
WE'RE GOING TO
WIN THIS THING.

291
00:14:00,271 --> 00:14:01,805
YOU SEEM
SO CONFIDENT.

292
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:03,407
WELL, YOU GOT
TO BE, HAROLD.

293
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:05,109
FISHING'S A
MENTAL GAME.

294
00:14:05,109 --> 00:14:08,279
IT'S ALL ABOUT
WHAT YOU'VE GOT
IN YOUR NOGGIN.

295
00:14:13,217 --> 00:14:15,486
OKAY, FINE, BUT I STILL
NEED THE CHEQUE TODAY.

296
00:14:15,486 --> 00:14:17,221
WHAT CHEQUE?

297
00:14:17,221 --> 00:14:19,690
THE $5,000 CHEQUE,
THE WAGER.

298
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,259
YOU TOLD ME THERE WAS
A $10,000 PRIZE.

299
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:24,061
YEAH, YOU PUT UP FIVE,
THEY PUT UP FIVE,

300
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:26,030
THAT'S 10.

301
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,465
OH, I'M THINKING
OF PUTTING UP FIVE, HAROLD.

302
00:14:28,465 --> 00:14:30,701
WELL, DON'T BLAME ME.
YOU SIGNED THE AGREEMENT.

303
00:14:30,701 --> 00:14:32,803
YOU ACCEPTED
THE CHALLENGE.

304
00:14:32,803 --> 00:14:34,672
HAROLD, HOW COULD YOU
LET THIS HAPPEN?

305
00:14:34,672 --> 00:14:38,342
DON'T YOU READ DOCUMENTS
BEFORE I SIGN THEM?

306
00:14:38,342 --> 00:14:40,644
[ APPLAUSE ]

307
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:44,648
Red:
SO BILL CAME BY.

308
00:14:44,648 --> 00:14:45,983
WE HEARD HE HAD
A CASE OF SHINGLES.

309
00:14:45,983 --> 00:14:49,920
WE MISUNDERSTOOD.

310
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,692
SO HE AND WALTER HAD PLANNED
TO RE-SHINGLE THE SHED.

311
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:56,860
AND SO, YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

312
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,328
THE SHINGLES ARE THERE
AND HE BROUGHT A LADDER

313
00:14:58,328 --> 00:14:59,963
CAREFUL, OOH.
AND OH, OH.

314
00:14:59,963 --> 00:15:02,166
EVERYTHING'S FINE.
WE'RE GOOD.

315
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,068
WHOOPS.

316
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:07,204
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

317
00:15:07,204 --> 00:15:08,906
AND BILL TAKES THE LADDER
OVER AND SETS UP.

318
00:15:08,906 --> 00:15:10,908
THEY'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY
PUT THE SHINGLES

319
00:15:10,908 --> 00:15:13,510
ON THE LITTLE SHED
ON THE LEFT THERE.

320
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,546
AND BILLS KNOWS HE
SHOULD ALWAYS HOLD THE LADDER,

321
00:15:15,546 --> 00:15:19,183
BUT YOU'RE BETTER TO HOLD IT
FROM THE SIDE, BILL.

322
00:15:19,183 --> 00:15:21,185
AND THEN --
CAREFUL, CAREFUL, CAREFUL.

323
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:22,152
OH.

324
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:25,055
AND THEY'RE NOT EVEN
ON THE ROOF YET.

325
00:15:25,055 --> 00:15:26,690
OKAY, THEY FINALLY
GET UP THERE,

326
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,992
AND THEY START NAILING
THE SHINGLES ON.

327
00:15:28,992 --> 00:15:31,595
THE HEAD COMES OFF
THE HAMMER AND --

328
00:15:31,595 --> 00:15:35,165
WELL, YOU GOT TWO WINDOWS
THAT MATCH NOW.

329
00:15:35,165 --> 00:15:37,034
OKAY, NEVER MIND,
NEVER MIND.

330
00:15:37,034 --> 00:15:38,135
SO AWAY THEY GO.

331
00:15:38,135 --> 00:15:39,736
START HAMMERING IN,

332
00:15:39,736 --> 00:15:41,672
AND WALTER SET UP
HIS SHINGLES THERE

333
00:15:41,672 --> 00:15:44,241
AND HE MUST HAVE SET IT UP
OVER A KNOT OR SOMETHING.

334
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:45,409
IT WAS REAL HARD,

335
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:47,110
AND HE COULDN'T GET
THE NAIL TO GO IN PROPERLY

336
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,046
BECAUSE IT'S STARTING TO
BEND OVER AND EVERYTHING.

337
00:15:49,046 --> 00:15:50,781
SO HE DID THE
NORMAL MALE RESPONSE,

338
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:53,250
JUST HIT HER
A LITTLE BIT HARDER.

339
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,285
LIKE THAT.

340
00:15:57,854 --> 00:15:59,256
OKAY, IS HE ALL RIGHT?

341
00:15:59,256 --> 00:16:00,958
UH-H-H...

342
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,259
YEAH, HE'S GOOD.

343
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:04,995
OKAY, LATER THAT DAY THEY
DECIDED TO WORK TOGETHER

344
00:16:04,995 --> 00:16:06,230
RATHER THAN INDEPENDENTLY,

345
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,564
SO I GET WALTER TO --

346
00:16:07,564 --> 00:16:09,866
YOU KNOW, THIS DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE THE BEST IDEA EVER TO ME.

347
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:11,301
YOU KNOW, I JUST --

348
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:12,869
THERE WE GO.

349
00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:14,071
OKAY, THAT'S GOOD.

350
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:15,105
WOW.

351
00:16:15,105 --> 00:16:18,208
WHY DON'T YOU FALL IN
BACKWARDS THIS TIME?

352
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,010
A LITTLE CHANGE OF PACE.

353
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,045
STILL LATER THAT DAY

354
00:16:22,045 --> 00:16:23,513
THEY'RE FINALLY GETTING
THE THINGS ON THERE,

355
00:16:23,513 --> 00:16:26,650
BUT BILL DECIDES WE'VE GOT
TO UP THE TECHNOLOGY HERE.

356
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,719
WE'VE GOT ONE OF THESE
NAIL GUN UNITS

357
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:29,820
WITH THE COMPRESSED AIR.

358
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,122
TAKE HER UP
TO 60-70 POUNDS.

359
00:16:32,122 --> 00:16:34,191
THERE... OOPS.

360
00:16:34,191 --> 00:16:37,027
WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE PARKED THERE.

361
00:16:37,027 --> 00:16:38,829
OKAY, SO BILL SAYS --

362
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:40,464
NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO, NO.

363
00:16:40,464 --> 00:16:41,732
NO, NO, NO.

364
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:42,966
OKAY, OKAY.

365
00:16:42,966 --> 00:16:45,335
SO WALTER'S GOING
TO JUST NAIL A NAIL IN

366
00:16:45,335 --> 00:16:47,504
WHILE BILL, KIND OF HOLDS
THE SHINGLE IN PLACE.

367
00:16:47,504 --> 00:16:49,206
THIS SHOULD WORK --
THIS SHOULD WORK JUST FINE.

368
00:16:49,206 --> 00:16:50,607
HE'S GOT SOME POWER NOW.

369
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:52,109
BUT BILL'S SAYING
NO, C'MON ON,

370
00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:54,211
THIS IS NOT NEARLY
THE KIND OF SPEED WE NEED.

371
00:16:54,211 --> 00:16:56,513
SO HE TAKES HER,
AMPS HER UP A LITTLE BIT MORE,

372
00:16:56,513 --> 00:16:58,048
TAKES HER UP TO 100 POUNDS,

373
00:16:58,048 --> 00:16:59,249
WHAT ARE YOU, 110?

374
00:16:59,249 --> 00:17:01,785
THAT'S GETTING PRETTY HIGH
WE'RE ALMOST UP TO --

375
00:17:01,785 --> 00:17:03,220
OH BOY, OH BOY.

376
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,287
SO BILL STARTS --

377
00:17:04,287 --> 00:17:05,822
IT'S GOT SOME REAL KICK
TO HER NOW

378
00:17:05,822 --> 00:17:06,957
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
HE STARTS LOSING IT.

379
00:17:06,957 --> 00:17:08,458
WE'RE LOSING IT.

380
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:09,426
CAREFUL, BILL, CAREFUL.

381
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:11,695
OH, DOWN THE HOLE,
HE STARTS FIRING INSIDE

382
00:17:11,695 --> 00:17:14,764
AND SHOOTING SHINGLES
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

383
00:17:14,764 --> 00:17:16,633
SO BILL HEADS DOWN
AND WALTER, GET DOWN!

384
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:18,468
GET DOWN THE LADDER!
SAVE YOURSELF!

OKAY, FINE.

390
00:17:26,143 --> 00:17:27,377
THE SHED DIDN'T
GET SHINGLED.

391
00:17:27,377 --> 00:17:29,446
NO, THE SHED --

USED TO TALK INTO

400

00:18:02,112 --> 00:18:04,147
IT DIDN'T WORK,
BUT IT DID TEACH ME

404
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:07,617
THAT OUR TOWN DOES HAVE
PLAINCLOTHES POLICEWOMEN.

405
00:18:07,617 --> 00:18:09,352

WHEN OLD TECHNOLOGY

BUT BERNICE WANTS ME TO GO
WITH HER TO THE MALL.

411
00:18:24,634 --> 00:18:27,604
I SET UP THE T.V. IN A HIDDEN

00:18:27,604 --> 00:18:30,540

I COULD NEVER PULL THIS OFF

00:20:33,196 --> 00:20:35,098
OKAY, IF MY WIFE
IS WATCHING

464
00:20:35,098 --> 00:20:36,933
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT
HOME AFTER THE MEETING,

465
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:39,736
AND I'M THINKING OUR
MARRIAGE IS KIND OF A TIE,

466
00:20:39,736 --> 00:20:41,838
BUT WE LIKE TO CALL IT
A WIN-WIN

467
00:20:41,838 --> 00:20:44,340
BECAUSE NEITHER OF US IS
INTERESTED IN A STALEMATE.

468
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,609
HUH? HUH?

469
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:48,044
AND THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

470
00:20:48,044 --> 00:20:49,512
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND HAROLD

471
00:20:49,512 --> 00:20:51,414
AND THE WHOLE GANG
UP HERE AT POSSUM LODGE,

472
00:20:51,414 --> 00:20:53,416
KEEP YOUR CHEQUE
ON THE ICE.

473
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:57,620
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

474
00:20:59,555 --> 00:21:00,823
EVERYBODY
TAKE YOUR SEATS.

475
00:21:00,823 --> 00:21:03,526
COME ON, SIT DOWN,
SIT DOWN.

476
00:21:03,526 --> 00:21:05,728
ALL RISE.

477
00:21:08,564 --> 00:21:11,100
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI.

478
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,735
Red: SIT DOWN.

479
00:21:12,735 --> 00:21:15,705
BOW YOUR HEADS
FOR THE MAN'S PRAYER.

480
00:21:15,705 --> 00:21:19,075
I'M A MAN,
BUT I CAN CHANGE,

481
00:21:19,075 --> 00:21:21,043
IF I HAVE TO...

482
00:21:21,043 --> 00:21:23,279
I GUESS.

483
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:25,014
ALL RIGHT, MEN,
I THINK WE SHOULD ALL BE PROUD

484
00:21:25,014 --> 00:21:27,450
OF OUR PERFORMANCE
IN THE FISHING DERBY.

485
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,185
MAYBE EVERYBODY
COMING OUT EVEN

486
00:21:29,185 --> 00:21:30,953
IS KIND OF A
CANADIAN THING.

487
00:21:30,953 --> 00:21:32,688
OTHERWISE WE GET INTO
A BIG DISCUSSION

488
00:21:32,688 --> 00:21:33,956
ABOUT WINNERS AND LOSERS

489
00:21:33,956 --> 00:21:35,591
AND THE NEXT
THING YOU KNOW

490
00:21:35,591 --> 00:21:39,428
HAROLD'S HAVING
ANOTHER BAD DAY.
