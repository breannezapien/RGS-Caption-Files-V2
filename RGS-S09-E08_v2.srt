AND ANN MARIE WAS IN
THE KITCHEN MAKING DINNER,

AND I WAS WATCHIN'

THAT ONE.

204
00:07:57,642 --> 00:07:59,244
AH, GEEZ.
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO THAT?

205
00:07:59,277 --> 00:08:02,114
WELL, NOW, THIS IS WHERE THE
DISCREPANCY COMES IN, RED,

206
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,549
BECAUSE I BELIEVE
THAT I SAID,

207
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,785
"OKAY, SORRY, HONEY."

208
00:08:06,852 --> 00:08:10,822
BUT, APPARENTLY,
WHAT SHE HEARD WAS,

209
00:08:10,856 --> 00:08:12,724
"MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS."

210
00:08:12,757 --> 00:08:14,226
I SEE.
YEAH.

211
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:16,027
AND THAT'S WHEN SHE CAME IN
AND GRABBED THE REMOTE

212
00:08:16,094 --> 00:08:18,096
AND TOOK IT.

213

BIT OF GOO ON HERE.

FIX THAT, RED?

GET ANNE MARIE TO CHANGE THE
CHANNELS FOR YOU FROM NOW ON.

219
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,045

AT THIS POINT,

DON'T TELL HER

225
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:45,724
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS A KID,

226
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,792
WE ATE CHOCOLATE BARS,
CANDY, BUBBLE GUM,

227
00:08:47,826 --> 00:08:49,094
THAT KIND OF THING.

228
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,929
WHEN YOU ATE THAT STUFF, YOU
KNEW IT WAS BAD FOR YOU.

229
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:52,631
THAT WAS MOST OF THE APPEAL.

230
00:08:52,664 --> 00:08:54,899
WELL, NOW THEY'RE
MAKING CANDY LIKE THIS.

231
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:56,234
OUT OF FRUIT.

232
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:57,569
FRUIT.

233
00:08:57,636 --> 00:08:59,204
FRUIT ISN'T
BAD FOR YOU.

234
00:08:59,237 --> 00:09:00,639
WHERE'S THE
FUN IN THAT?

235
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,142
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING
INTERESTING HERE.

236
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:05,577
THE WAY THEY MAKE THIS STUFF.

237
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,380
I FIGURE ALL THEY DO IS SQUISH
THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS
OUTTA FRUIT

238
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:11,082
AND TURN IT INTO
A VINYL-LIKE SHEET.

239
00:09:11,116 --> 00:09:13,051
VERY SIMILAR
TO PREHISTORIC TIMES,

240
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:16,254
WHERE THE DINOSAURS WOULD SIT
ON COAL WITH SO MUCH PRESSURE

241
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:18,590
THEY'D TURN
IT INTO DIAMONDS.

242
00:09:18,656 --> 00:09:21,259
DINOSAURS ACTUALLY HAD A
FASCINATION WITH DIAMONDS,

243
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:24,329
WHICH IS WHY SO MANY OLD PEOPLE
WEAR ALL THE JEWELLERY.

244
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:27,198
SO IT'S ONLY LOGICAL THAT IF I
COULD SQUISH SOME FRUIT,

245
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:30,135
LIKE, SAY, THESE APPLES,
WITH ENOUGH FORCE,

246
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:31,836
I COULD PAVE
MY DRIVEWAY.

247
00:09:36,007 --> 00:09:38,410
WELL, THEY TELL ME IT
TAKES ABOUT A MILLION
TONS OF PRESSURE

248
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:41,179
TO TURN COAL
INTO DIAMONDS.

249
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:43,181
I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED
THAT MUCH PRESSURE

250
00:09:43,248 --> 00:09:46,050
SINCE I MET MY
WIFE'S PARENTS.

251
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:48,019
BUT I DO HAVE
AN OIL DRUM HERE.

252
00:09:48,052 --> 00:09:50,355
IN FACT, I'VE GOT
FIVE OF THEM.

253
00:09:50,421 --> 00:09:52,657
THEY'RE
45 GALLONS EACH.

254
00:09:52,724 --> 00:09:54,025
I FILL THEM UP WITH WATER.

255
00:09:54,092 --> 00:09:55,994
I FIGURE THAT'S
500 POUNDS A PIECE,

256
00:09:56,027 --> 00:09:57,395
BUT THERE'S FIVE OF 'EM.

257
00:09:57,462 --> 00:09:58,930
AND THEN, OF COURSE,
THE WEIGHT IS CONCENTRATED

258
00:09:58,997 --> 00:10:00,899
ON THE SMALL PART OF THE EDGE
THAT TOUCHES THE GROUND.

259
00:10:00,932 --> 00:10:02,333
SO YOU TAKE
THE TOTAL WEIGHT,

260
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,969
DIVIDE IT BY
THE COSINE OF THE TANGENT...

261
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:09,107
WELL, YOU DO THE MATH.
I HAVE NO IDEA.

262
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:14,245
NOW, I NEEDED A HANDLE TO
ATTACH THIS OIL DRUM TO
THE FRONT BUMPER,

263
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:16,581
SO I JUST RIPPED
ONE OFF MY LAWN MOWER

264
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:18,816
AND SPREAD IT
OUT A LITTLE BIT.

265
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,251
IT MEANS I CAN'T
CUT THE LAWN NOW,

266
00:10:20,318 --> 00:10:22,186
BUT I'LL GET OVER IT.

267
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,290
THEN I JUST DUCT TAPED THE WHOLE
UNIT TO THE FRONT BUMPER.

268
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:28,459
ACTUALLY, THAT WAS
THE HARD PART.

269
00:10:28,493 --> 00:10:31,296
THE OTHER OIL DRUMS WERE
A LOT EASIER TO MOUNT.

270
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:36,701
AND I'VE ALREADY FILLED
THEM UP WITH WATER,

271
00:10:36,768 --> 00:10:39,537
SO WE'RE PRETTY
WELL READY TO GO.

272
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,239
YOU WANNA USE
LOW GEAR ON THIS

273
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:45,076
BECAUSE YOU'VE ADDED ABOUT
SEVEN TONS TO THE GROSS
VEHICLE WEIGHT.

274
00:10:45,143 --> 00:10:46,477
ACTUALLY, WITH THAT
MUCH WEIGHT,

275
00:10:46,544 --> 00:10:48,780
YOU CAN TURN ANY
FRUIT INTO ASPHALT.

276
00:10:48,813 --> 00:10:51,416
BANANAS MIGHT BE, YOU KNOW,
A LITTLE SLIPPERY,

277
00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:54,952
BUT WITH THE PEACHES
YOU'RE GONNA GET KIND
OF A COBBLESTONE EFFECT.

278
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:56,654
I DECIDED TO
GO WITH APPLES

279
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:58,823
BECAUSE I HAVE APPLES.

280
00:10:58,856 --> 00:11:02,327
AND IN A MINUTE, I'M GONNA TURN
THEM INTO APPLESAUCE YOU
CAN DRIVE ON.

281
00:11:04,729 --> 00:11:06,998
SO REMEMBER THAT IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

282
00:11:07,065 --> 00:11:10,068
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

283
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:13,237
AND NOW, AS THE BRITISH USED
TO SAY WHEN THEY RODE
INTO SCOTLAND,

284
00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:15,707
LET'S GO CRUSH
SOME MACINTOSHES.

285
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:39,664
I WANNA TALK TO YOU
OLDER GUYS OUT THERE.

286
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,966
YOU KNOW,
AS THE YEARS GO BY,

287
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:44,035
YOU END UP LOOKIN'
INTO THE BATHROOM MIRROR

288
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:47,205
LIKE YOU'RE LOOKIN' UNDER
THE HOOD OF A USED CAR.

289
00:11:47,238 --> 00:11:51,108
YOU SEE A LOT OF
OLD PARTS, LOOSE JOINTS,

290
00:11:51,142 --> 00:11:54,779
AND A TIRED POWER PLANT THAT
USES UP AN AWFUL LOT OF FUEL

291
00:11:54,846 --> 00:11:57,281
FOR WHAT YOU GET
OUT OF IT.

292
00:11:57,348 --> 00:12:00,852
NOW, MOST GUYS JUST PUT LOWER
WATT BULBS INTO THE BATHROOM,

293
00:12:00,885 --> 00:12:03,287
BUT SOME GUYS ARE
ACTUALLY GOING OUT

294
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:05,523
AND GETTING A FACELIFT.

295
00:12:05,556 --> 00:12:08,292
PLEASE, PLEASE,
THINK TWICE ABOUT THAT.

296
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:10,728
YOU'RE ONLY
FOOLIN' YOURSELF.

297
00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:13,164
NO MATTER HOW MANY WRINKLES YOU
TAKE OUT OF THE BODY WORK,

298
00:12:13,197 --> 00:12:16,734
YOU WON'T STOP THE
TRANSMISSION FROM SLIPPING,

299
00:12:16,801 --> 00:12:19,303
PLUS YOU ARE MESSIN'
WITH A GOOD THING.

300
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:22,873
YOU SEE, THE WORLD DOES NOT
EXPECT MUCH FROM US
MIDDLE AGED GUYS.

301
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,909
AS LONG AS WE CAN
SIT UP AT THE TABLE,

302
00:12:24,976 --> 00:12:26,777
TAKE OUT THE GARBAGE,

303
00:12:26,844 --> 00:12:29,580
MAYBE SHOW UP AT WORK
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,

304
00:12:29,647 --> 00:12:32,350
WE PRETTY MUCH
CARRY OUR OWN WEIGHT.

305
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,752
ONCE YOU START LOOKIN' 25,

306
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:39,490
PEOPLE ARE GONNA EXPECT
THINGS FROM YOU THAT
YOU CAN'T DELIVER;

307
00:12:39,557 --> 00:12:41,492
THINGS LIKE
ENERGY, AMBITION

308
00:12:41,525 --> 00:12:44,829
OR ANY KIND OF
A CLUE ABOUT ANYTHING.

309
00:12:44,862 --> 00:12:49,300
SO I SAY JUST LET THE WRINKLES
AND THE JOWLS AND THE
EYE BAGS COME

310
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:51,335
BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK
LIKE A BASSET HOUND,

311
00:12:51,369 --> 00:12:53,571
EVERYBODY'LL LEAVE
YOU ALONE.

312
00:12:53,604 --> 00:12:55,473
AND LET'S BE HONEST.

313
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:57,441
THAT'S ALL WE
REALLY WANT.

314
00:12:57,475 --> 00:12:59,777
IF YOU WANNA LOOK YOUNGER,
TRY SMILING.

315
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,480
IT'S CHEAP AND IT'LL LIFT A LOT
MORE THAN YOUR FACE.

316
00:13:02,513 --> 00:13:04,248
REMEMBER, I'M PULLIN'
FOR YOU.

317
00:13:04,315 --> 00:13:06,050
WE'RE ALL
IN THIS TOGETHER.

318
00:13:06,117 --> 00:13:09,019
[ APPLAUSE ]

319
00:13:10,654 --> 00:13:14,024
WELL, I'M NOT DOIN' TOO BAD ON
THE BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION PLAN.

320
00:13:14,091 --> 00:13:15,826
I HAD THE ONE SLIP UP.

321
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,895
THE WAITRESS MADE A
MISTAKE AND BROUGHT ME

322
00:13:17,928 --> 00:13:21,132
A WHEATGERM SHAKE
AND A TOFU BURGER,

323
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:24,568
AND, UH, IT SOMEHOW
GOT AIRBORNE.

324
00:13:24,602 --> 00:13:26,504
BUT I DID CLEAN IT UP
AS BEST I COULD.

325
00:13:26,537 --> 00:13:29,473
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN
DO WITH THAT GRASS CLOTH
WALLPAPER, YOU KNOW.

326
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,408
Mr. GREEN,

327
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:33,110
THANKS FOR
THE VAN.

328
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:34,411
OH, NO PROBLEM.

329
00:13:34,478 --> 00:13:35,846
I LEFT IT PARKED
OUT BACK.

330
00:13:35,913 --> 00:13:37,848
OH, HERE'S AN EXTRA
TEN BUCKS FOR YOUR TROUBLE.

331
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:39,350
WELL,
THANKS, MIKE,

332
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,252
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE
JUST GONNA FILL IT UP
WITH GAS INSTEAD.

333
00:13:41,318 --> 00:13:42,920
OH, I FILLED UP
THE GAS TANK.

334
00:13:42,953 --> 00:13:44,688
YEAH, SURE.
THAT'S A BONUS.

335
00:13:44,722 --> 00:13:47,591
AND THE REWARDS
JUST KEEP ON COMIN'.

336
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,560
SO WHAT'D YOU PUT IN 'ER,
REGULAR OR HI-TEST?

337
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:54,598
I'M NOT SURE.

338
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:57,701
WHATEVER WINSTON
USES IN HIS TRUCK.

339
00:13:57,768 --> 00:14:00,671
Mr. GREEN, DO YOU SUPPOSE
I COULD BORROW THE VAN
AGAIN TONIGHT?

340
00:14:00,738 --> 00:14:02,239
SAME DEAL.
CASH PLUS.

341
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:03,474
SURE.
NO PROBLEM.

342
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,376
GREAT.
OKAY.

343
00:14:05,442 --> 00:14:07,244
OH, I GOTTA GO.

344
00:14:09,813 --> 00:14:11,115
WHAT'S
HIS PROBLEM?

345
00:14:11,181 --> 00:14:14,051
HE'S GOT GAS.

346
00:14:14,385 --> 00:14:16,220
SO HOW MUCH OF THE PRIZE
MONEY DID HE GIVE YOU?

347
00:14:16,253 --> 00:14:18,022
WHAT PRIZE MONEY?

348
00:14:18,088 --> 00:14:19,556
THE 100 BUCKS
HE WON LAST NIGHT

349
00:14:19,623 --> 00:14:22,359
DRIVING YOUR VAN IN THE
DEMOLITION DERBY.

350
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,428
WHAT!

351
00:14:24,495 --> 00:14:26,130
OH, YEAH.
THERE'S ANOTHER
ONE TONIGHT.

352
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:27,665
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

353
00:14:27,698 --> 00:14:28,966
I'M ENTERING THE
SEPTIC TRUCK INTO IT.

354
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:31,268
AND THE YOU-KNOW-WHAT'S
GONNA FLY.

355
00:14:31,302 --> 00:14:32,803
I GOTTA STOP HIM!

356
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,571
MIKE!
MIKE!

357
00:14:34,638 --> 00:14:36,373
WAIT.
COME ON.

358
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:40,778
Red:
HAD SOME HEAVY PIPE
AND PROPANE TANKS AND WHATNOT

359
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:42,212
TO GET OUT OF THE OF
THE WAREHOUSE.

360
00:14:42,246 --> 00:14:44,081
IT WAS UP ON THE SECOND FLOOR
IN TOWN THERE.

361
00:14:44,114 --> 00:14:45,482
SO WALTER WAS GONNA HELP ME.

362
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:47,051
IT WAS VERY HEAVY,
VERY HEAVY.

363
00:14:47,084 --> 00:14:49,787
THE CAST-IRON, UH,
THE CAST-IRON PIPE --

364
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,121
WELL, I CAN'T PICK 'EM UP.
ONCE I GET 'EM UP --

365
00:14:51,155 --> 00:14:53,057
OKAY, YOU HAND IT TO ME.
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT NOW.

366
00:14:53,123 --> 00:14:54,725
OH, THAT'S --
OH, THAT'S  --

367
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:56,260
LOT OF WEIGHT TO THAT.

368
00:14:56,326 --> 00:14:57,728
WHY DON'T I SET THAT
DOWN OF THE SHELF

369
00:14:57,761 --> 00:14:59,096
AND PUT ON MY TRUSS HERE.

370
00:14:59,163 --> 00:15:00,831
OH!

371
00:15:00,898 --> 00:15:02,699
ALL RIGHT, NO.
WE NEED A BETTER PLAN.

372
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:04,902
HERE'S A WAY --
HERE'S A WAY TO USE YOUR BRAI

373
00:15:04,968 --> 00:15:06,670
AND ALSO TEACH THE
KIDS ABOUT PHYSICS.

374
00:15:06,737 --> 00:15:08,072
C'MON, WALTER.
C'MON.

375
00:15:08,138 --> 00:15:09,740
I GOT A BETTER --
JUST LEAVE IT, WALTER.

376
00:15:09,773 --> 00:15:11,075
WALTER, LEAVE IT.
LEAVE IT.

377
00:15:11,141 --> 00:15:12,810
C'MON.
BETTER IDEA.

378
00:15:12,843 --> 00:15:16,080
WE'RE UP ON THE SECOND FLOOR,
AND THAT'S THE TRUCK I
WANNA PUT 'ER IN.

379
00:15:16,146 --> 00:15:18,048
SO WE GOT A PULLEY --
SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING?

380
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:19,316
WE GOT A PULLEY,
WE GOT A CRATE,

381
00:15:19,383 --> 00:15:20,818
AND WE GOT A HUNK OF ROPE.

382
00:15:20,851 --> 00:15:23,086
THIS IS JUST USIN' YOUR BRAIN
INSTEAD OF YOUR BRAWN.

383
00:15:23,153 --> 00:15:24,855
SO GET WALTER --
WALTER, YOU GO DOWN THERE,

384
00:15:24,922 --> 00:15:26,423
AND I'LL TOSS YOU
DOWN THE ROPE,

385
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,791
AND THE CRATE,
WE'LL BRING THE CRATE UP.

386
00:15:27,858 --> 00:15:29,026
WE'LL PUT THE STUFF
IN THE CRATE,

387
00:15:29,092 --> 00:15:30,594
AND TAKE HER
DOWN THAT WAY.

388
00:15:30,661 --> 00:15:32,262
MAKE THAT A GOOD
KNOT THERE, WALTER,

389
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:33,730
AND HERE COMES THE ROPE.

390
00:15:33,797 --> 00:15:35,833
SEE, KIDS, THIS IS
THE WHOLE THING.

391
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:40,003
NEWTON'S -- NEWTON'S LAW THAT
NOTHING'S WORTH A FIG.

392
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,240
AND HAUL THAT UP THERE.
WALTER'S VERY, VERY STRONG.

393
00:15:43,307 --> 00:15:45,442
LOT OF UPPER BODY STRENGTH.

394
00:15:45,475 --> 00:15:49,046
I HAVE MORE OF THE LOWER BODY
STRENGTH FROM SITTING, I THINK

395
00:15:49,112 --> 00:15:53,317
OKAY, I'LL PULL THAT IN THERE
AND YOU JUST STAY CALM FOR
A MINUTE, WALTER.

396
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,586
I'LL LOAD UP THE STUFF,
PROPANE TANKS IN THERE.

397
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:57,621
BOY, THOSE ARE HEAVY UNITS.

398
00:15:57,688 --> 00:16:00,457
IT'S THE CAST-IRON PIPES THAT
REALLY HAVE THE WEIGHT TO THEM

399
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:02,092
BY GOLLY.

400
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,560
SO I'M GETTIN' THEM IN THERE.

401
00:16:03,594 --> 00:16:05,295
ALL RIGHT, I THINK YOU GOT A
PRETTY GOOD LOAD.

402
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:06,630
YOU THINK YOU CAN
HAUL THAT, WALTER?

403
00:16:06,697 --> 00:16:08,465
YEAH, SHOULD BE ALL RIGHT.
SHOULD BE FINE.

404
00:16:08,498 --> 00:16:10,100
BOY, I HOPE HE WEIGHS ENOUGH.

405
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:11,835
OH, NO.

406
00:16:11,902 --> 00:16:13,437
OH!

407
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,907
APPARENTLY NOT.
AND I'VE JAMMED HIS
FINGERS UP INTO THE --

408
00:16:16,974 --> 00:16:20,544
NOW, THE PROBLEM IS THERE'S TO
MUCH WEIGHT IN THE CRATE,

409
00:16:20,577 --> 00:16:22,579
SO I TAKE THE WEIGHT
OUT OF THE CRATE...

410
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:25,382
THIS SHOULD HELP.
MAYBE ONE MORE.

411
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:27,217
ONE MORE SHOULD DO IT.

412
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,553
JUST KIND OF EASE --
SHE'S GETTIN' LIGHTER.

413
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:31,355
NO, ONE MORE, I GUESS.

414
00:16:31,421 --> 00:16:32,689
THAT SHOULD DO IT.

415
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:34,057
NO, OKAY, ONE MORE.
ALL RIGHT.

416
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:35,659
WELL, THAT'S
TOO MUCH MAYBE.

417
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:37,027
OH, OH, OH, OH!

418
00:16:37,094 --> 00:16:38,395
OKAY, UH --

419
00:16:38,462 --> 00:16:40,330
OKAY, I TOOK TOO MUCH
WEIGHT OUT OF THAT.

420
00:16:40,397 --> 00:16:41,765
LET'S GET THE
REST OF THE STUFF.

421
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:44,067
OH, HERE IT COMES.
HERE WE GO.

422
00:16:44,101 --> 00:16:47,337
OKAY, NOW,
TELL ME, WALTER,

423
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:49,139
WASN'T THAT EASIER?

424
00:16:49,206 --> 00:16:50,807
I THOUGHT SO.

425
00:16:54,945 --> 00:16:58,215
BACK IN THE 1930s,
MULTIPLE BIRTHS WERE RARE.

426
00:16:58,281 --> 00:17:00,517
EVERYBODY KNEW ABOUT
THE DIONNE QUINTUPLETS

427
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:02,953
AND THE CASH COW
THAT HAD BEEN,

428
00:17:02,986 --> 00:17:05,689
SO IT WAS NO SURPRISE WHEN OUR
LOCAL TOWN COUNCIL

429
00:17:05,756 --> 00:17:09,760
TRIED TO DRUM UP INTEREST IN THE
BIRTH OF THE MANNING TRIPLETS.

430
00:17:09,826 --> 00:17:14,631
BORN TO CARLOTTA AND MAX MANNING
ON AUGUST 24, 1932,

431
00:17:14,664 --> 00:17:17,167
WAS A SET OF TRIPLETS,
THE MANNING TRIPLETS.

432
00:17:17,234 --> 00:17:19,336
ALL IDENTICAL,
ESPECIALLY IN LOOKS.

433
00:17:19,402 --> 00:17:22,339
THEY WERE ALL BOYS.

434
00:17:22,372 --> 00:17:25,475
THEY WERE NAMED
SNAP, CRACKLE, AND POP.

435
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:29,713
THAT WAS THE WINNING ENTRY
IN A CONTEST SPONSORED BY
OUR LOCAL PAPER,

436
00:17:29,746 --> 00:17:33,416
"THE POSSUM LAKE
DAILY MOVEMENT."

437
00:17:33,483 --> 00:17:36,253
THE TOWN BUILT AN ADDITION
ON THE FAMILY HOME

438
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:37,821
TO HOUSE THE NEW ARRIVALS

439
00:17:37,888 --> 00:17:42,492
AND TO SEAT THE 150 PAYING
CUSTOMERS ON BLEACHERS
INSIDE THE THE HOUSE.

440
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,396
THE FAMILY GOT THE HOME,
AND THE TOWN GOT ALL
THE GATE RECEIPTS,

441
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:49,599
PLUS ALL THE MERCHANDISING
RIGHTS AND FUTURE
CONSIDERATIONS

442
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:52,969
IF THE PARENTS CRAZY ENOUGH
TO TRY THIS STUNT AGAIN.

443
00:17:54,237 --> 00:17:55,772
WELL, IT WAS A DISASTER.

444
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,407
NOBODY CAME.

445
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,809
I MEAN, WHO WOULD COME TO SEE
THREE IDENTICAL BOYS

446
00:17:59,876 --> 00:18:01,711
WHEN YOU COULD DRIVE
A FEW A HOURS MORE

447
00:18:01,778 --> 00:18:03,647
AND GAWK AT FIVE
IDENTICAL GIRLS,

448
00:18:03,713 --> 00:18:08,218
PLUS GET A CHANCE TO SEE WHAT
FRENCH PEOPLE LOOK LIKE?

449
00:18:08,285 --> 00:18:12,589
THEN THE STORY CAME OUT THAT
Mr. MANNING HAD BEEN IN EUROPE
WHEN THE BOYS WERE BORN,

450
00:18:12,622 --> 00:18:16,259
PLUS HE'D BEEN ABROAD FOR THE
ENTIRE YEAR BEFORE THAT.

451
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:17,727
YOU KNOW,

452
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:21,197
IT KINDA TOOK THE HEARTWARMING
LUSTRE OF INNOCENCE OFF
THE STORY,

453
00:18:21,264 --> 00:18:23,099
IF YOU GET MY DRIFT.

454
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:25,935
Red:
WHEN MAYOR DENNIS FLAHERTY

455
00:18:26,002 --> 00:18:28,605
WAS NAMED BY Mrs. MANNING
AS THE BOYS' FATHER,

456
00:18:28,638 --> 00:18:32,642
HE CONFESSED AND IMMEDIATELY
SUED FOR HALF THE
GATE RECEIPTS.

457
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:36,146
HE WAS TURFED OUT OF OFFICE
LATER THAT DAY.

458
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:38,815
MANY YEARS FROM THEN,
A BROKEN MAN,

459
00:18:38,882 --> 00:18:40,383
HIS DYING WORDS WERE,

460
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,420
"BAD THINGS
COME IN THREES."

461
00:18:43,753 --> 00:18:46,623
GROWING UP, THOSE MANNING
TRIPLETS DID ALL KINDS
OF SPORTS.

462
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:48,491
THEY ALWAYS DID
THEM TOGETHER,

463
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:50,126
STARTING WITH BASEBALL.

464
00:18:50,193 --> 00:18:51,895
THEY PLAYED FIRST, SECOND,
AND THIRD BASE

465
00:18:51,961 --> 00:18:53,830
FOR THE POSSUM LAKE
MARKER BOYS.

466
00:18:53,863 --> 00:18:55,365
THEY EVEN GOT THEIR NAMES
IN THE RECORD BOOK

467
00:18:55,432 --> 00:18:58,501
AS THE ONLY TRIPLETS TO TURN A
TRIPLE PLAY IN THE NINTH GAME

468
00:18:58,568 --> 00:19:02,305
AT HOME ON NATURAL GRASS
PRIOR TO THE FIFTH INNING.

469
00:19:02,372 --> 00:19:04,774
WHEN ALL THE TROUBLE
STARTED IN TURKEY,

470
00:19:04,808 --> 00:19:07,410
THE THREE MANNING BROTHERS
AND I WENT DOWN AND ENLISTED

471
00:19:07,477 --> 00:19:12,081
IN THE POSSUM COUNTY LIGHT
DRAGOON HIGHLANDERS
OF FOOT RIFLES.

472
00:19:12,148 --> 00:19:15,418
NOW, THEY NEVER SAW ANY COMBAT
ACTIONS SINCE THEY WERE
PRETTY GREEN,

473
00:19:15,485 --> 00:19:19,489
AND FUNNILY ENOUGH, OUR COUNTRY
WASN'T INVOLVED IN THE TURKISH
WAR IN ANY WAY.

474
00:19:19,556 --> 00:19:23,493
IRONICALLY, THEY WOUND UP
IN THE ARMY POSTAL CORPS,

475
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,529
SORTING OVERFLOW MAIL
FOR THE DIONNE QUINTS.

476
00:19:26,563 --> 00:19:28,498
'COURSE, THAT INVOLVED
A LOT OF HEAVY LIFTING.

477
00:19:28,531 --> 00:19:30,400
ALL THREE BROTHERS
INJURED THEIR BACKS

478
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:32,936
AND HAD TO BE INVALIDED
OUT OF THE SERVICE.

479
00:19:33,002 --> 00:19:34,938
THIS LED TO THE FAMOUS
MANNING RULE

480
00:19:35,004 --> 00:19:37,040
THAT WOULD NEVER AGAIN ALLOW
MEMBERS OF THE SAME FAMILY

481
00:19:37,073 --> 00:19:38,908
TO SORT MAIL IN
THE SAME UNIT.

482
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,111
USING THEIR HONOURABLE
MEDICAL DISCHARGES,

483
00:19:42,145 --> 00:19:44,347
ALL THREE BROTHERS WENT
TO WORK FOR THE POST OFFICE,

484
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,683
WHERE THEY IMMEDIATELY
WENT ON COMPENSATION

485
00:19:46,749 --> 00:19:50,153
UNTIL THEIR
RETIREMENT IN 1987.

486
00:19:50,219 --> 00:19:52,422
THE MANNING TRIPLETS
ARE STILL ALIVE TODAY,

487
00:19:52,488 --> 00:19:55,892
AND THEY ARE WORKING ON THREE
SEPARATE VOLUMES OF THEIR
AUTOBIOGRAPHY CALLED

488
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:58,428
"IS THIS A GREAT
COUNTRY OR WHAT?"

489
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,734

NOT NOW, MIKE!

493

DO-GOODER STUFF IS OKAY
FOR SOME PEOPLE,

494
00:20:15,278 --> 00:20:17,880
BUT IT WAS
KILLING ME.

495
00:20:17,947 --> 00:20:19,782
I THINK I PICKED UP
ALL THE PARTS.

496
00:20:19,816 --> 00:20:21,284
I WOULD JUST
LIKE TO APOL --

497
00:20:21,351 --> 00:20:23,052
THERE'S TIME FOR
THAT LATER, MIKE, OKAY.

498
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,654
NO, NO, IT'S GOOD TO
BE NICE TO PEOPLE
AND EVERYTHING,

499
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:26,856
BUT IF ALL YOU'RE DOIN'
IS KEEPING THE
ANGER INSIDE,

TURN INTO A SPLEEN.

THE DEMOLITION DERBY.

I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING
CATHARTIC ABOUT SEEING
THAT MUCH DESTRUCTION.

503
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,303
UNLESS, OF COURSE, IT'S
HAPPENING TO YOUR OWN VAN!

504
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:42,939
I'LL FIX THE VAN.
I'LL PUT IT ALL TOGETHER.

LETS ME GO TO THE CITY,

I'LL GET YOU
ANOTHER ONE.

507
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,880
NO, NO, NO, YOU JUST
PUT MY POSSUM VAN
BACK TOGETHER.

508
00:20:50,947 --> 00:20:52,448
OKAY, YOU GOT IT.
AND I TELL YOU WHAT,

509
00:20:52,482 --> 00:20:54,550
I WON'T EVEN
CHARGE YOU, OKAY?

510
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:55,952
WELL, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

SOME CONGRATULATIONS,
EH, WINSTON?

AND MY SEPTIC TRUCK

AND MOOSE THOMPSON
AND HIS '73 GREMLIN.

MAN!

OUT OF GAS.

NOW, I DON'T GET IT

FILLED UP THAT TRUCK
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.

HAVE A LEAKY TANK.

FIX IT WITH A LOCKING
