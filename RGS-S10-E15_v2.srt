YOU KNOW ONE OF THE SIGNS
OF A TRUE HANDYMAN

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,640
IS TO FIGURE OUT
HOW SOMETHING WORKS

3
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:09,609
AND THEN BE ABLE TO USE
THAT SAME TECHNOLOGY

4
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:12,011
IN AN ENTIRELY
NEW APPLICATION;

5
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:14,614
FOR EXAMPLE, THIS GATE.

6
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:16,516
I GOT A SPRING
AND I GOT A LATCH.

7
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:20,320
NOW, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING,

8
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,455
HOW IS HE GOING TO USE
A SPRING AND A LATCH?

9
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,324
OR HOW DID HE GET SO SMART?

10
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,493
OR WHY DOES HE
WALK LIKE THAT?

11
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,495
WELL, HERE'S YOUR ANSWER,

12
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:30,363
THIS ROPE OPERATES THE LATCH,

WHICH I'VE GOT ATTACHED TO
THIS END OF MY EAVESTROUGH.

14
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:36,102
I ATTACHED THE SPRING
WAY DOWN THE OTHER END
OF THE EAVESTROUGH.

UP AT THE LODGE THIS WEEK,

REAL HIGH AND GETTING HIGHER.

HEY, Mr GREEN, WE FOUND OUT
WHAT'S MAKING THE LAKE RISE.

30
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:32,358
THERE'S A BIG ANIMAL
INFESTATION PROBLEM, RED.

31
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,295
HOW CAN AN ANIMAL

THE LAKE GO UP,

UNLESS THEY
ALL HAVE SERIOUS
BLADDER PROBLEMS?

33

NO, THEY BUILT A BIG
DAM ACROSS THE LAKE.

AND THE BIG HUMP
ON THE BACK.

LEAST THEY DO UP AT
THE NUCLEAR PLANT.

YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
A BEAVER IF IT
BIT YOUR BUTT.

I DID SO.

41
00:02:03,589 --> 00:02:07,727
NO, IT'S BEAVERS, Mr GREEN.
THEY BUILT THIS BIG DAM SO
THE WATER CAN'T GET OUT.

42
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,896
WELL, THEN SURELY YOU
CAN JUST GO DOWN THERE

AND TAKE THE DAM
APART, CAN'T YOU?

FOR YOU TO MAKE ONE SLIP,

AREN'T SUPPOSED
TO HIBERNATE.

304
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:23,827
YEAH.
REALLY?

305
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:25,729
OH, MAYBE THAT'S WHY I KEPT
WAKING UP ALL THE TIME.

306
00:14:25,763 --> 00:14:28,666
I SWEAR I WOKE UP
EVERY MONTH.

307
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:31,001
AND I KEPT HAVING THESE
WEIRD RECURRING DREAMS.

308
00:14:31,035 --> 00:14:33,404
I DREAMT THAT I WAS LYING UP
HERE IN MY FIRE TOWER,

309
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,172
STARING UP AT THE CEILING,

310
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:37,441
AND SHIVERING.

311
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:40,177
GORD, YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T
YOU COME AWAY WITH ME,

312
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,979
AND WE'LL TAKE
YOU TO A DOCTOR,

313
00:14:42,046 --> 00:14:44,581
MAYBE A WHOLE
TEAM OF DOCTORS.

314
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:47,384
I DON'T KNOW, RED, I'VE HEARD
ABOUT PEOPLE BEING TREATED

315
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:49,553
EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE
PERFECTLY NORMAL.

316
00:14:49,586 --> 00:14:52,256
WELL, SEE, YOU DON'T
HAVE THAT RISK.

317
00:14:52,322 --> 00:14:55,859
AND IF YOU LIKE, WE CAN
GET YOU A FEMALE DOCTOR.

318
00:14:55,926 --> 00:14:58,896
I WOULD LIKE THAT.

319
00:14:58,962 --> 00:15:00,731
I'D LIKE THAT VERY MUCH.

320
00:15:00,764 --> 00:15:02,633
OH, YEAH, YES.

321
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,768
AND I NEED A COMPLETE
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION.

322
00:15:04,835 --> 00:15:06,804
A COMPLETE
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION.

323
00:15:06,837 --> 00:15:09,139
YEAH.
I HEAR YA, GORD.

324
00:15:09,173 --> 00:15:10,908
WHICH END OF ME DO YOU
THINK SHE'LL START WITH?

325
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:12,676
DEPENDS ON
IF YOU BRUSH
YOUR TEETH FIRST.

326
00:15:12,743 --> 00:15:14,745
YES.

327
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:17,981
Red: YOU KNOW, THE RABBIT
EARS JUST AREN'T WHAT
THEY USED TO BE.

328
00:15:18,048 --> 00:15:20,384
ACTUALLY, THEY NEVER WERE
WHAT THEY USED TO BE.

329
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:21,518
ED TRIES EVERYTHING --

330
00:15:21,552 --> 00:15:23,587
NO, THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.

331
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,155
I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

332
00:15:25,222 --> 00:15:26,890
THERE'S SOMETHING COMING,
A LITTLE TREAT.

333
00:15:26,924 --> 00:15:29,960
I KNOW YOUNG WALTER WENT OUT
AND GOT US A LITTLE UPGRADE

334
00:15:30,027 --> 00:15:32,095
IN THE TV AREA WITH
A SATELLITE DISH.

335
00:15:32,162 --> 00:15:34,131
HERE HE IS.

336
00:15:36,867 --> 00:15:38,001
LEAVE HER THERE.

337
00:15:41,305 --> 00:15:44,241
NO, TIE DOWN STRAPS TO
WORRY ABOUT, GOOD.

338
00:15:44,274 --> 00:15:46,443
AND HE'S GOT ALL THE CABLE,

339
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:49,479
JUST MOUNT HER ON TO ONE
OF OUR BUILDINGS THERE,

340
00:15:49,513 --> 00:15:52,316
POINTING TOWARDS
THE SATELLITE.

341
00:15:52,349 --> 00:15:54,718
AND, OKAY, SO WALTER'S
GONNA GO UP ON THE ROOF,

342
00:15:54,785 --> 00:15:58,388
AND WE'LL TOSS HIM UP
THE VARIOUS PARTS.

343
00:15:58,422 --> 00:16:02,159
WELL, HE'S AN ATHLETIC
YOUNG FELLOW, ISN'T HE?

344
00:16:02,226 --> 00:16:04,061
WE'LL SEE HOW THAT GOES.

345
00:16:04,127 --> 00:16:06,496
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, THIS IS A HEAVY UNIT.

346
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,432
AND UP SHE GOES.

347
00:16:08,465 --> 00:16:10,734
YOU KNOW, I THINK
WE ACTUALLY THREW THAT
STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR,

348
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:14,004
WHICH IS NOT REALLY --

349
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:16,206
OKAY, I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

350
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:18,442
THE SATELLITE DISH
HAS A CONCAVE SHAPE

351
00:16:18,475 --> 00:16:20,410
MAYBE WE CAN USE THAT
TO OUR ADVANTAGE.

352
00:16:20,477 --> 00:16:23,947
I'M TELLING ED JUST TO PUT
THE
 CABLE DOWN ON THE ONE SID

353
00:16:23,981 --> 00:16:25,849
COME ON ROUND,
COME ON ROUND,

354
00:16:25,882 --> 00:16:28,151
OKAY, READY NOW,
WE'RE GONNA GO ONE, TWO --

355
00:16:28,218 --> 00:16:29,720
AND THEN GIVE 'ER --
GIVE 'ER --

356
00:16:29,786 --> 00:16:31,355
THERE WE GO!

357
00:16:31,388 --> 00:16:33,657
OH, OH, TOO MUCH.
TOO MUCH.

358
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,859
ALL RIGHT, SO WE
WENT BACK INSIDE,

359
00:16:35,926 --> 00:16:37,995
AND WALTER MEANWHILE
WENT AND GOT THE CABLE,

360
00:16:38,061 --> 00:16:41,131
AND HE WAS HOOKING UP
THE SATELLITE DISH,

361
00:16:41,164 --> 00:16:45,202
AND HE LET THE CABLE GO
AND WE DIDN'T REALIZE THAT

362
00:16:45,268 --> 00:16:48,071
HE WASN'T COMPLETELY FINISHED
AND WE THOUGHT WHEN
THE CABLE CAME IN

363
00:16:48,105 --> 00:16:50,073
THAT MEANT SHE WAS
ALL HOOKED UP,

364
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:53,076
SO, ALL WE HAD TO DO NOW
WAS ATTACH IT

365
00:16:53,143 --> 00:16:55,679
BUT NOT REALIZING THAT
WALTER WAS ACTUALLY
STILL WORKING ON IT

366
00:16:55,746 --> 00:17:00,150
AND WE WERE HOOKING IT UP
TO THE HYDRO OUTLET
ON THE TV THERE

367
00:17:00,183 --> 00:17:02,486
AND THEN -- OH, BOY.

368
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,755
OH, AND THAT'S IT.
H, CAREFUL, CAREFUL.

369
00:17:04,788 --> 00:17:07,357
NOW I'M GETTING WALTER
ON THE TV.

370
00:17:07,424 --> 00:17:09,693
WHAT THE HECK'S THAT ABOUT?

371
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,429
OH, MAN.

372
00:17:12,496 --> 00:17:15,365
HEY, LOOK, ED,
IT'S A FISHING SHOW.

373
00:17:15,432 --> 00:17:17,801
YEAH, THERE WE GO.

374
00:17:17,868 --> 00:17:22,672
[ APPLAUSE ]

375
00:17:30,614 --> 00:17:32,449
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN OFTEN
JUDGE A HANDYMAN

376
00:17:32,516 --> 00:17:35,819
BY THE NUMBER
OF EMPTY DUCT TAPE
ROLLS HE HAS LYING AROUND.

377
00:17:35,852 --> 00:17:38,088
ESPECIALLY AFTER
A LONG WEEKEND.

378
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:40,757
THE QUESTION THEN IS
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH
ALL THESE CORES?

379
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,926
THROW 'EM OUT?
BURN 'EM?

380
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:44,895
JUST IGNORE 'EM?

381
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:46,796
NOT IF YOU'RE MARRIED.

382
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,765
NO, NO, THE REAL
HANDYMAN RECYCLES,

383
00:17:48,832 --> 00:17:52,102
AND HE DOES IT IN A WAY THAT
BEST SUITS HIS NEEDS
AND HIS LIFESTYLE.

384
00:17:52,168 --> 00:17:54,738
ANYBODY CAN HAVE
A WINE CELLAR.

385
00:17:54,804 --> 00:17:57,941
WITH THESE BABIES,
YOU CAN HAVE A BEER CELLAR.

386
00:17:57,974 --> 00:18:03,146
[ APPLAUSE ]

387
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:05,515
YOU'VE BEEN
LETTING ON YOU'RE A
CAR EXPERT FOR YEARS.

388
00:18:05,548 --> 00:18:07,617
YEAH, WHENEVER A CAR
WAS ON THE FRITZ,

389
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:09,653
PEOPLE WOULD RELY ON
YOU TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE

390
00:18:09,686 --> 00:18:12,122
"SOUNDS LIKE A
CLOTTED MANIFOLD."

391
00:18:12,155 --> 00:18:15,358
YEAH, OR
"YOUR CARBURETOR'S
THROWN A ROCKER PANEL."

392
00:18:15,392 --> 00:18:18,628
YEAH, BUT NOW YOUR
SISTER-IN-LAW'S IN THE
MARKET FOR  A USED CAR,

393
00:18:18,695 --> 00:18:21,464
AND SHE'S COUNTING ON
YOU TO GIVE IT THE
ONCE-OVER.

394
00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:23,600
BUT YOU DON'T
HAVE A CLUE, DO YOU?

395
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:25,835
UNLESS THAT CAR'S UNDER
TEN FEET OF WATER,

396
00:18:25,902 --> 00:18:28,238
OR ON FIRE,
YOU'RE LOST.

397
00:18:28,271 --> 00:18:29,873
SO HERE'S WHAT YOU DO.

398
00:18:29,906 --> 00:18:31,708
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

399
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:33,576
YEAH, JUST STAND AND
LISTEN TO THE SALESMAN

400
00:18:33,643 --> 00:18:35,612
DO THE WORK OF
SELLING THE CAR.

401
00:18:35,645 --> 00:18:37,213
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

402
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,382
LOOK LIKE YOU'RE
DOUBTING EVERY WORD.

403
00:18:39,449 --> 00:18:41,785
BUT KEEP
YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

404
00:18:41,818 --> 00:18:43,486
FOR ALL HE KNOWS YOU'RE
A CLASS "A" MECHANIC

405
00:18:43,553 --> 00:18:46,389
WAITING TO POUNCE ON
EVERY NOSE PULLER HE
CAN COME UP WITH.

406
00:18:46,456 --> 00:18:48,491
NOW YOU'VE GOT HIM
ON THE DEFENSIVE,

407
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:50,593
AND THAT'S JUST WHERE
YOU WANT HIM TO BE.

408
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,430
NOW, HE MAY IN FACT
SUSPECT YOU'RE A
COMPLETE IDIOT,

409
00:18:53,463 --> 00:18:55,131
BUT HE'LL
NEVER PROVE IT.

410
00:18:55,198 --> 00:18:57,567
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP
YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

411
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,202
YEAH.
AND DON'T THANK US.

412
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:01,304
THAT'S WHAT
FRIENDS ARE FOR.

413
00:19:04,908 --> 00:19:07,777
WELL, OPERATION DAM BUSTERS
IS WELL UNDER WAY,

414
00:19:07,844 --> 00:19:10,146
WE GOT BUZZ SHERWOOD TO
FLY OVER THE DAMS

415
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,882
AND SPRAY IT WITH
BEAVER REPELLENT.

416
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:16,386
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM ALL
COME STAMPEDING OUT OF THERE,

417
00:19:16,452 --> 00:19:20,223
50 SETS OF BUCK TEETH
GLISTENING IN THE SUN.

418
00:19:20,256 --> 00:19:23,259
LOOKED LIKE CLOSING TIME
AT THE COMPUTER CLUB.

419
00:19:23,326 --> 00:19:26,029
[ LAUGHTER ]

420
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:27,897
BUT ONCE THEY
CLEARED THE AREA,

421
00:19:27,964 --> 00:19:30,166
WE JUST AIMED THE
RAFT AT THE DAM

422
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,969
AND STARTED THE OUTBOARD
MOTOR ON THE BACK OF HER.

423
00:19:33,036 --> 00:19:34,771
WELL, THE RAFT
IS STILL ON TARGET,

424
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:36,639
BUT IT'S STILL GOT
A LITTLE WAYS TO GO.

425
00:19:36,673 --> 00:19:39,409
GEE, YOU KNOW,
IT SURE LOOKS WEIRD GOING
ACROSS THE LAKE AT FULL SPEED

426
00:19:39,442 --> 00:19:41,211
WITH NOBODY DRIVING IT.

427
00:19:41,244 --> 00:19:43,479
JUST OLD MAN SEDGWICK
WATER SKIING BEHIND IT.

428
00:19:43,546 --> 00:19:45,281
WHAT?

429
00:19:45,315 --> 00:19:47,116
OH, IT'S OKAY, HE FELL.

430
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,718
IT WAS PRETTY HARD, THOUGH.

431
00:19:48,785 --> 00:19:50,620
YEAH, HIS BATHING SUIT
CAME OFF OVER HIS HEAD.

432
00:19:50,687 --> 00:19:55,425
WOW, THAT'S GONNA SLOW
DOWN HE RESCUE TEAM,
I'LL TELL YA.

433
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:58,394
WELL, THAT RAFT SHOULD
HIT PRETTY SOON,

434
00:19:58,461 --> 00:20:00,330
DON'T YOU WANT TO
GO BACK AND WATCH?

435
00:20:00,396 --> 00:20:02,231
YEAH.

436
00:20:02,598 --> 00:20:04,534
OH, MAN.

437
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,969
WHERE IS IT?

438
00:20:06,002 --> 00:20:07,303
OH, THERE IT IS.

439
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:09,172
OH, MAN!
OH, MAN! OH MAN!

440
00:20:09,205 --> 00:20:11,307
JUST A MINUTE.
JUST A MINUTE.
LET ME SEE IT.

441
00:20:11,374 --> 00:20:13,109
WHAT?
HOLY DINAH.

442
00:20:13,176 --> 00:20:16,179
IT BLEW THAT DAMN
TO SMITHEREENS.

443
00:20:16,245 --> 00:20:18,214
LET ME SEE THAT.

444
00:20:18,247 --> 00:20:19,716
THAT'S NOT THE DAM.

445
00:20:19,782 --> 00:20:21,818
THAT'S MOOSE
THOMPSON'S HOUSE.

446
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:24,087
THERE'S THE DAM,

447
00:20:24,153 --> 00:20:25,722
AND THE RAFT IS
HEADING RIGHT FOR IT.

448
00:20:25,788 --> 00:20:27,357
IT'S GOING TO
BE A DIRECT HIT.

449
00:20:27,423 --> 00:20:29,592
HOW DO WE KNOW THE
TORPEDO'S STILL ARMED?

450
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,895
WELL, WE DON'T SO
EDGAR FILLED THE OTHER HOT
WATER HEATER WITH DYNAMITE

451
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:34,530
JUST TO BE ON
THE SAFE SIDE.

452
00:20:34,564 --> 00:20:36,199
OH, OKAY.

453
00:20:36,265 --> 00:20:38,101
BOY, IS IT EVER
