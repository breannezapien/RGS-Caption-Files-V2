00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,408
LET'S JUST LET MY FINGERS

00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:23,750
NOTHING HAPPENED,

27
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,817
MY A.D.O. DIDN'T VIDEO

37
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:41,968

38
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:42,702
>>HAROLD: WELL IT'S THAT

39
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:43,569

00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:59,285
JUST HOLD STILL.

44
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:03,456
IT USUALLY WORKS AT HOME,

45
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:07,593
MIND YOU WE HAVE THE BETA.

46
00:02:07,593 --> 00:02:08,394
INTERESTING WEEK UP AT

47
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,296
THE LODGE THIS WEEK,

48
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,299
ALL THE POWER WENT OFF DURING

49
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:16,235
A BIG THUNDERSTORM SO THE GUYS

50
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:17,203
ALL WENT OUT AND GATHERED

51
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:18,638
UP FIREWOOD, SO THAT WE COULD

52
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,006
KEEP WARM AND THEN WHEN THE

53
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,708
POWER CAME BACK ON,

54
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,977
WELL IT DIDN'T YOU KNOW,

55
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:25,678
SO WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS

56
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:26,846
JUNIOR SINGLETON HAD CUT DOWN

57
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,014
A POWER LINE POLE TO USE

58
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:31,584
AS FIREWOOD, SO NOW WE'RE

59
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,120
THINKING WHAT ELSE CAN WE USE

60
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,854
FOR ELECTRICITY AROUND HERE?

61
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:35,955
AND WE STARTED THINKING

62
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,523
ABOUT POSSUM LAKE.

63
00:02:37,523 --> 00:02:38,724
NOW POSSUM LAKE'S GOT SO MUCH

64
00:02:38,724 --> 00:02:40,026
ACID IN IT AND IT'S GOT LEAD,

65
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,928
CADMIUM AND ZINC,

66
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:42,962
YOU KNOW IN A CERTAIN WAY

67
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:45,898
THE LAKE IS LIKE A BIG BATTERY,

68
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:46,699
SO WE GOT THINKING AND DRINKING

69
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:47,700
AND OUT WE COME WITH ALL

70
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,902
OUR JUMPER CABLES,

71
00:02:49,902 --> 00:02:50,870
WE HOOKED UP ALL THE

72
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,971
JUMPER CABLES TO THE CAR

73
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,039
BATTERIES AS WE TRIED TO

74
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,941
JUMPSTART POSSUM LAKE.

75
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,509
NOW UNFORTUNATELY SOMEBODY HAD

76
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,910
REVERSED THE POLARITY ON THEIR

77
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,545
CABLES AND SOMETHING REAL

78
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:01,247
STRANGE HAPPENED AND WE ENDED

79
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:06,953
UP MAGNETIZING THE WHOLE LAKE.

80
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:07,753

TO DO WITH POSSUM LAKE,

88
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:19,966

I'D SHOW YOU HOW TO

135
00:04:55,327 --> 00:04:57,129
MAKE YOUR OWN AMUSEMENT PARK.

136
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:58,330
NOW I GOT THIS IDEA FROM

137
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,632
HAROLD AND HIS TEENAGE BUDDIES,

138
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,799
THEY GO DOWN TO THE PINE CONE

139
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,800
FESTIVAL THERE AND THEY PAY

140
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,168
$3 BUCKS EACH FOR THE PRIVILEGE

141
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:04,503
OF RIDING AROUND ON ONE OF

142
00:05:04,503 --> 00:05:05,704
THEM THINGS WHERE THEY SPIN

143
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:07,072
IN A CIRCLE FOR 40 SECONDS

144
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:08,040
AND THEN THEY BARF UP THEIR

145
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,941
SLUSH PUPPY AND THEIR

146

CHEESE DOG.

147
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:11,410
AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,

148
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,311
GOLLY THERE'S GOT TO BE A

149
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:13,178
CHEAPER WAY TO HAVE THAT

150
00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:15,314
KIND OF FUN, SO TODAY I'M

151

THIS ONE JUST STICKING OUT

159
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:26,992

161
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:30,162

ABOUT USING A PIECE OF

176

EAVESTROUGH AND OF COURSE

177

OUT OF THE QUESTION.

179
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:12,538
OKAY NOW STICK THIS INTO

184

187
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:31,423
ABOUT A BUCKET SEAT?

188
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,691
OR THESE OLD MILK CARTONS CAN BE

189
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:33,859
TURNED INTO SEATS AND YOU CAN

190
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:34,960
GET THESE FOR FREE BEHIND

191
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,028
ONE OF THEM VARIETY STORES

192
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,764
IF THEY'RE CLOSED.

193
00:06:38,764 --> 00:06:39,965
AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW WHEN

194
00:06:39,965 --> 00:06:41,767
I WAS GROWING UP WE ALWAYS

195
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:44,236
USED TIRES, SO WHY NOT USE

196
00:06:44,236 --> 00:06:46,138
A TIRE AS ONE OF YOUR SEATS

197
00:06:46,138 --> 00:06:47,639
AND THAT'S 3 OF THE 4 CORNERS.

198
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,207
AND FOR THE FOURTH CORNER

199
00:06:49,207 --> 00:06:51,476
SOMETHING A LITTLE INTERESTING,

200
00:06:51,476 --> 00:06:53,045

SEAT AND HOOK THAT ON,

202
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:55,547
IT MIGHT ACT TO BE KIND

203
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:59,618
OF DANGEROUS ON A WINDY DAY.

204
00:06:59,618 --> 00:07:00,919
ALL RIGHT I'VE USED THESE

205
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:03,355
STUFFED ANIMALS TO REPRESENT

206
00:07:03,355 --> 00:07:04,222
KIDS, CRASH TEST TEDDIES

207
00:07:04,222 --> 00:07:05,757
I CALL THEM...

208
00:07:05,757 --> 00:07:07,526
I GOT THEM OFF OF MOOSE'S BED.

209
00:07:07,526 --> 00:07:08,427
BUT OF COURSE NOW WE NEED

210
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,728
SOME SORT OF A POWER TO

211
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:11,396
DRIVE THIS UNIT.

212
00:07:11,396 --> 00:07:12,531
NOW YOU COULD USE SAY AN

213
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:13,965
OLD ELECTRIC DRILL OR MAYBE

214
00:07:13,965 --> 00:07:15,334
A LAWNMOWER OR SOMETHING,

215
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,268
OR YOU COULD TAKE SOME BED

216
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:18,070
SHEETS AND MAKE A WIND POWER

217
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,037
UNIT, BUT WHAT I'VE DONE IS

218
00:07:19,037 --> 00:07:21,173
I'VE ATTACHED A PLASTIC

219
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:23,375
COVERED WIRE, A CLOTHES WIRE

220
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,910
TYPE THING HERE AND COILED IT

221
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,111
ALL AROUND THE SHAFT AND THEN

222
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:27,179
HOOKED IT RIGHT UP TO THE

223
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:29,548
BACK OF THE POSSUM VAN,

224
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:30,582
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A POSSUM VAN

225
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:31,683
YOU COULD HOOK IT UP TO THE

226
00:07:31,683 --> 00:07:33,552
BACK OF YOUR CAR OR WHATEVER,

227
00:07:33,552 --> 00:07:35,353
AND THE IDEA BEING OF COURSE

228
00:07:35,353 --> 00:07:36,488
WHEN YOU DRIVE AWAY IT TENDS

229
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:39,224
TO SPIN THIS AND WHAT YOU COULD

230
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:41,126
DO HERE IS THE FIRST THING IN

231
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:42,060
THE MORNING YOU POP YOUR KIDS

00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,496

233
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:46,531
JUST FIRE OFF TO WORK AND THEN

00:07:50,435 --> 00:07:51,236

NONE OF OUR OUTBOARD MOTORS ARE

361
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,360
WORKING BECAUSE OF THAT MAGNET

GOT THE DIESEL ENGINE HERE,

364
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:39,464
IF THIS THING MIGHT WORK YOU

365
00:11:39,464 --> 00:11:40,598
COULD MAYBE GIVE ME

PREVENT THE LAKE FROM

AND THAT'S KIND OF

507
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:37,634
A BEAUTY ISN'T IT?

508
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:38,769
THE TRAILER IS A LITTLE

509
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:40,470
BIT OF OVERKILL,

510
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,472
ANYWAY WE HOISTED IT UP THERE

511
00:15:42,472 --> 00:15:43,674
AND PUT HER ON AND ONE THING

512
00:15:43,674 --> 00:15:45,142

517
00:15:51,048 --> 00:15:52,015
ANYWAY BILL WILL FIGURE IT OUT,

518
00:15:52,015 --> 00:15:52,883
RIGHT BILL?

519
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:55,719
YEAH WE KNOW, WE KNOW.

520
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:57,221
ANYWAY HE PULLED THAT DOWN

521
00:15:57,221 --> 00:15:58,755
AND HOOKED HER UP AND THEN,

522
00:15:58,755 --> 00:15:59,656
BUT BY GOLLY WHAT A BEAUTIFUL

523
00:15:59,656 --> 00:16:02,159
DAY FOR LAUNCHING A BOAT.

524
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,227
BILL'S GOING TO GET IN THERE

525
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:04,995

00:16:09,032 --> 00:16:10,300

530
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,602
THEIR BOATS AND WHATEVER.

531
00:16:11,602 --> 00:16:12,970
>>BILL: (SHOUTING) AH!

532
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:13,804
>>RED: YOU KNOW IT'S FUNNY,

533
00:16:13,804 --> 00:16:14,738
YOU'D THINK BOATERS WOULD

534
00:16:14,738 --> 00:16:16,206
BE KIND OF FREEWHEELING,

535
00:16:16,206 --> 00:16:17,274
EASY TO GET ALONG WITH

536
00:16:17,274 --> 00:16:18,542
BUT BY GOLLY YOU KNOW

537
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:19,476
THEY'RE STARTING TO GET

538
00:16:19,476 --> 00:16:20,711
A LITTLE UPSET, HONKING THEIR

539
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:23,580
HORNS AND WHAT HAVE YOU.

540
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,648
I FELT WE WERE MAKING OUR

541
00:16:24,648 --> 00:16:26,350
BEST EFFORTS YOU KNOW TO GET

542
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,018
THE BOAT IN, IT'S NOT EASY,

543
00:16:28,018 --> 00:16:29,920
IT'S NOT EASY LAUNCHING A BOAT

544
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,654
I MEAN YOU'VE HAD THE WHOLE

545
00:16:30,654 --> 00:16:31,621
WINTER WHERE YOU HAVEN'T

546
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:33,657
HAD A CHANCE TO YOU KNOW

547
00:16:33,657 --> 00:16:34,925
PRACTICE LAUNCHING THE BOAT

548
00:16:34,925 --> 00:16:35,826
OR ANYTHING, SO THIS IS THE

549
00:16:35,826 --> 00:16:37,060
FIRST TIME IN FOR US AND

550
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,095
BY GOLLY LET'S HAVE A

551
00:16:38,095 --> 00:16:39,663
LITTLE PATIENCE HERE.

552
00:16:39,663 --> 00:16:41,431
OKAY THINGS GO WRONG,

553
00:16:41,431 --> 00:16:43,133
THAT CAN HAPPEN.

554
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:44,101
ANYWAY WE'RE GETTING,

555
00:16:44,101 --> 00:16:45,369

>>BILL: (SHOUTING) AH!

569
00:17:05,822 --> 00:17:06,523

00:17:07,924 --> 00:17:09,392
COORDINATE, ISN'T THAT A

572
00:17:09,392 --> 00:17:10,193
BEAUTIFUL DAY, LOOK AT THAT,

LOOK AT THE DUCKS THERE,

575
00:17:12,162 --> 00:17:13,997

576
00:17:13,997 --> 00:17:16,366

LOOK AT THE BALANCE EH?

579
00:17:18,502 --> 00:17:19,402
HE SHOULD TRY WATERSKIING

580
00:17:19,402 --> 00:17:20,537
MAYBE LATER ONCE WE GET

581
00:17:20,537 --> 00:17:21,805
THAT BOAT IN THE WATER.

582
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:22,806
ANYWAY WE GET HER ALL SET UP

583
00:17:22,806 --> 00:17:23,807
AND WE'RE OKAY NOW AND

584
00:17:23,807 --> 00:17:24,908

00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,544
YOU SEE THIS IS A TIMESAVER,

587
00:17:27,544 --> 00:17:28,378
YOU PUT YOUR STUFF IN THE BOAT

588
00:17:28,378 --> 00:17:29,713
BEFORE YOU LAUNCH YOUR BOAT AND

589
00:17:29,713 --> 00:17:30,947
THAT WAY YOU'RE NOT HOLDING THE

590
00:17:30,947 --> 00:17:33,149
OTHER PEOPLE UP YOU KNOW,

591
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:34,284
THEY CAN JUST LAUNCH THEIR BOATS

592
00:17:34,284 --> 00:17:36,820
BECAUSE YOU'RE OUT OF THE WAY,

593
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,890

00:19:38,274 --> 00:19:39,209
THE LAKE IS MAGNETIZED

674
00:20:05,935 --> 00:20:06,703
WONDERED IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

675
00:20:06,703 --> 00:20:07,770
WHAT WE COULD DO TO DEMAGNETIZE

676
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:08,738
THE LAKE, HAVE YOU EVER HAD ANY

677
00:20:08,738 --> 00:20:10,473
KIND OF EXPERIENCE LIKE THAT?

678
00:20:10,473 --> 00:20:11,307
>>GLEN: WELL YOU KNOW RED I DID

679
00:20:11,307 --> 00:20:12,241
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE FRIDGE

680
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:13,843
ONCE IN THE R.V. HERE

681
00:20:13,843 --> 00:20:14,677
IT KEPT SLIDING BACK AND

682
00:20:14,677 --> 00:20:15,645
FORTH, IT KEPT SQUISHING

683
00:20:15,645 --> 00:20:17,380
THE CAT SO I MAGNETIZED IT.

684
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,281
>>RED: AH HAH.

685
00:20:18,281 --> 00:20:19,015
>>GLEN: AND THAT WAS NO GOOD SO

686
00:20:19,015 --> 00:20:19,982
I HAD TO DEMAGNETIZE IT BECAUSE

687
00:20:19,982 --> 00:20:20,817
THE DOOR, I COULDN'T GET

688
00:20:20,817 --> 00:20:21,684
IT OPEN.

689

>>RED: OH GOSH,

690
00:20:22,785 --> 00:20:24,687
SO HOW DID YOU DEMAGNETIZE IT?

691
00:20:24,687 --> 00:20:26,155
>>GLEN: WELL I TOOK A BALLOON

692
00:20:26,155 --> 00:20:27,056
AND I RUBBED IT AGAINST MY HEAD

693
00:20:27,056 --> 00:20:31,894
AND I TOUCHED IT,

694
00:20:31,894 --> 00:20:33,363
I WAS PULLING YOUR LEG RED,

695
00:20:33,363 --> 00:20:34,697
I'M SORRY, NO WHAT I DID WAS

696
00:20:34,697 --> 00:20:37,266
I MADE MYSELF AN ELECTROMAGNET

697
00:20:37,266 --> 00:20:37,967
AND I HOOKED IT UP TO THE

698
00:20:37,967 --> 00:20:39,068
R.V. BATTERIES SO IT

699
00:20:39,068 --> 00:20:42,872
WAS 4 TIMES 72 AMPS.

708
00:20:52,148 --> 00:20:53,149
YOU CAN'T DO ANY REPAIRS

709
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:54,851
AND YOU CAN'T SELL ANY BOATS?
