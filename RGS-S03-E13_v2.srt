TO BE THE FERRY BOAT CAPTAIN

00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:45,905
BECAUSE THE FERRY BOAT CAPTAIN

46
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:46,973
IS RETIRING SO HE GETS

47
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:47,874

NOT EVERYBODY WANTS YOUR JOB.

54
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,454
>>HAROLD: NO EVERYBODY WANTS

55
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,388
TO BE IN THE RACE BECAUSE

56
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:03,689
EVERY DAY THE FERRY BOAT IT

57
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:04,457
GOES OVER TO SUNSHINE ISLAND

58
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,391
AND OVER THERE THERE'S

59
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:08,061
A NUDIST CAMP,

60
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:12,565
NUDISTS THAT ARE NUDE, YES!

61
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:13,499
>>RED: THEY'RE SUN WORSHIPPERS

COME ON THEY'RE NAKED NUDISTS

65
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,471
OVER THERE UNCLE RED

66
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,372
THE OLD FERRY BOAT CAPTAIN

67
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:20,406
ONLY RETIRED BECAUSE

68
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:21,507
HE HAD A HEART ATTACK,

69
00:02:21,507 --> 00:02:22,575
HE'S 27 THERE'S SOME KIND

70
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:25,778
OF CLUE IN THERE I FIGURE.

71
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:26,712
>>RED: WELL EVERYBODY'S JUST

72
00:02:26,712 --> 00:02:27,580
KIND OF GUESSING ON THIS

73
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,648
YOU COULD SIT OUT IN A

74
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,549
FISHING BOAT OUTSIDE THAT

75
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:30,516
NUDIST CAMP AND JUST PRETEND

76
00:02:30,516 --> 00:02:31,684
YOU WERE, I MEAN THE SUN

77
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:32,985
WORSHIPPER PLACE AND YOU

78
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:33,986
COULD PRETEND YOU WERE

79
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:34,854
FISHING AND YOU COULD STARE

80
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:35,755
IN THERE ALL DAY I DON'T CARE

81
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:36,622
HOW MANY TIMES YOU PEEK

82
00:02:36,622 --> 00:02:37,557
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE ONE

83
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:38,524
NAKED BODY AND APPARENTLY

84
00:02:38,524 --> 00:02:39,392
THERE'S SOME KIND OF A ROAD

85
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:40,259
THAT GOES IN THERE WHERE

86
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:41,294
YOU CAN SEE THEM BUT

87
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,395
BY GOLLY I'VE NEVER

88
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:43,496
BEEN ABLE TO FIND IT.

89
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,463
>>HAROLD: I AGREE

90
00:02:44,463 --> 00:02:45,464
IT'S TOTALLY DISGUSTING

91
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:47,433
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.

92
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:48,267
>>RED: WELL THEN WHY DID

93
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:49,101
YOU BRING IT UP HAROLD

94
00:02:49,101 --> 00:02:50,102
I DIDN'T?

95
00:02:50,102 --> 00:02:50,970
>>HAROLD: WELL BECAUSE THE

96
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:51,871
PEOPLE AT HOME WANT TO KNOW

97
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:52,838
AND IT WOULD PROBABLY BOOST

98
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:53,873
OUR RATINGS YOU KNOW BUT

99
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:54,807
IN MY OWN PERSONAL OPINION

100
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:55,875
I THINK IT WOULD BE

101
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,243
IMMORAL AND EXPLOITIVE.

102
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,077
>>RED: BUT YOU DON'T MIND

103
00:02:58,077 --> 00:02:59,078
MAKING A BUCK OFF SOMETHING

104
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,079
THAT YOU THINK IS A

105
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,180
DISGUSTING SPECTACLE.

122
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:39,885
'HANDYMAN CORNER' WE'RE GOING

123
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:40,753
TO SHOW YOU HOW TO GET

124
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:42,421
BETTER TV RECEPTION.

125
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:43,255
ONE WAY IS JUST TO

126
00:03:43,255 --> 00:03:44,457
SWITCH TO A DIFFERENT

127
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:45,558
CHANNEL BUT WE'RE THINKING

128
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,960
MORE OF ONE OF THEM FANCY

129
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,695
SATELLITE DISH/BOWL THINGS

130
00:03:49,695 --> 00:03:51,397
THAT LET'S YOU GET A MILLION

131
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,798
STATIONS ALL CARRYING

132
00:03:52,798 --> 00:03:54,200
YOU KNOW STUFF LIKE 'CHEERS'

133
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,401
AND 'MASH' AND 'LUCY'

134
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,602
THAT KIND OF THING.

135
00:03:56,602 --> 00:03:57,636
WE WERE ACTUALLY THINKING

136
00:03:57,636 --> 00:03:59,271
OF BUYING OURSELVES A DISH

137
00:03:59,271 --> 00:04:00,439
AT THE LODGE AND WE WENT DOWN

138
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,774
AND LOOKED AT THEM AND THESE

139
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,375
THINGS ARE A $1000.

140
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,177
A $1000! THAT'S WHAT

141
00:04:05,177 --> 00:04:07,346
WE PAY FOR HOUSES

142
00:04:07,346 --> 00:04:08,681
BUT I TOOK A CLOSE LOOK AT IT

143
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,282
AND I FIGURE GOLLY I CAN

144
00:04:10,282 --> 00:04:12,151
BUILD ONE OF THOSE.

145
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,285
SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED

146
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:15,321
IS ONE OF THESE PATIO TABLES

147
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:18,224
INCLUDING THE UMBRELLA

148
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,526
AND ABOUT 160 BAGS OF CHIPS

149
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:21,861
POTATO CHIPS THAT IS,

150
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:22,628
MAKE SURE YOU GET THE KIND

151
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:24,730
IN THE FOIL BAG.

152
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:29,702
STEP ONE EMPTY THE BAGS.

153
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:36,876
(LOUD CHOMPING & CRUNCHING)

154
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:40,813
42... NOW MAYBE WHAT WE SHOULD

155
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:44,516
DO IS JUST MAYBE POUR THESE

156
00:04:44,516 --> 00:04:45,885
INTO A PAIL AND THEN WE CAN

157
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:46,585
YOU KNOW EAT THEM LATER

158
00:04:46,585 --> 00:04:48,587
WHILE WE'RE WATCHING TV

159
00:04:48,587 --> 00:04:50,055
(COUGHS) I WISH I HAD THOUGHT

160
00:04:50,055 --> 00:04:55,060
OF THAT A LITTLE EARLIER.

161
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,028
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE CLEANED

162
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:57,997
THE PAIL OUT FIRST,

163
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:58,864
WELL I'LL TELL THE GUYS

164
00:04:58,864 --> 00:04:59,965
THESE CHIPS ARE SOUR CREAM

165
00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:03,502
AND ONION...

166
00:05:03,502 --> 00:05:06,005
43 OR IS THAT 44?

167
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:09,341
OH I'LL DO AN EXTRA.

168
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:16,515
OH GEEZ THAT WAS MY SPLEEN,

00:05:16,515 --> 00:05:18,017
THAT'S A 100

170
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,152
OH THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH.

171
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:21,353
BOY THIS PLACE IS STARTING

172
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:22,888
TO SMELL LIKE MR POTATOHEAD'S

173
00:05:22,888 --> 00:05:25,491
HONEYMOON SUITE.

174
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,558
ALRIGHT THAT WILL GIVE US

175
00:05:26,558 --> 00:05:27,459
THE REFLECTIVE SURFACE

176
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:28,460
FOR THE SATELLITE DISH

177
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,361
NOW WE NEED THE ACTUAL DISH

178
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:30,696
FORM AND THIS IS WHERE

179
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:32,931
THE PATIO UMBRELLA COMES IN.

180
00:05:32,931 --> 00:05:34,299
ALRIGHT FIRST WHAT WE'VE GOT

181
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:35,601
TO DO IS TO GENTLY REMOVE

182
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:40,172
THE UMBRELLA FROM THE STAND.

183
00:05:40,172 --> 00:05:41,540
THERE WE GO NOW WE'VE GOT

184
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,077
TO INVERT HER, FLIP HER OVER

185
00:05:45,077 --> 00:05:47,880
AND POINT HER BACK

186
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,582
OUT INTO SPACE,

187
00:05:50,582 --> 00:05:51,483
I'LL JUST AIM HER UP THROUGH

188
00:05:51,483 --> 00:05:53,886
THE HOLE IN THE LODGE ROOF.

189
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:54,653
THERE, NOW WE'LL SECURE IT

190
00:05:54,653 --> 00:05:55,788
ON THERE USING THE HANDYMAN'S

191
00:05:55,788 --> 00:06:00,426
SECRET WEAPON, DUCT TAPE.

192
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,294
NO PROBLEM, I GUESS YOU WOULDN'T

193
00:06:02,294 --> 00:06:02,995
WANT TO GIVE ME A HAND

194
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:12,304
EH HAROLD?

195
00:06:12,304 --> 00:06:13,038
MY HANDS ARE ALL GREASY

196
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:19,812
FROM SOMETHING.

197
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,380
OKAY NOW I'VE REALLY LAID

198
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,281
THE DUCT TAPE IN THERE

199
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,749
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO ALLOW

200
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:24,850
FOR WIND ESPECIALLY AFTER

201
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,220
44 BAGS OF CHIPS

202
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,088
AND WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE NOW

203
00:06:30,088 --> 00:06:32,357
IS A CONCAVE REFLECTIVE SURFACE

204
00:06:32,357 --> 00:06:33,225
AT LEAST WE WILL HAVE ONCE

205
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:34,760
WE ADD THE FOIL BAGS TO HER

206
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,928
AND WHAT THAT DOES IS IT

207
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,029
FOCUSES ALL THE ELECTRO-MAGNETIC

208
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,363
WAVES FROM WAY OUT IN SPACE

209
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:39,665
AND RIGHT UP HERE INTO

210
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:45,270
OUR RECEIVER.

211
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,239
IT'S STICKING THERE NOW,

212
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:48,640
NOW WHAT I HAVE TO DO IS

213
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,708
I HAVE TO OPEN UP ALL THE BAGS

214
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:52,644
LIKE THIS AND ATTACH THEM

215
00:06:52,644 --> 00:06:53,579
INSIDE THE DISH AND I

216
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,013
CAN DO THAT WITH DUCT TAPE

217
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:56,081
BUT IT'LL TAKE A WHACK OF

218
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:57,149
DUCT TAPE AND THAT'S GOING

219
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:58,884
TO COST YOU A FAIR COIN SO

220
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:02,354
I'VE GOT AN IDEA THAT'S FREE,

221
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:03,255
YOU KNOW ALL OF THEM PAINT

222
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:04,156
CANS THAT YOU'VE KEEPING

223
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:05,557
IN THE GARAGE OR DOWN IN THE

224
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:07,059
BASEMENT YOU KNOW FOR YEARS

225
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,427
AND YEARS BECAUSE THEY GOT

226
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,995
A HALF INCH OF PAINT IN THEM

227
00:07:09,995 --> 00:07:11,096
OR SOMETHING AND THEY'RE STILL

228
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:11,997
GOOD SO YOU DON'T THROW THEM

229
00:07:11,997 --> 00:07:13,231
OUT YOU JUST STORE THEM FOR

230
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:14,166
A WHILE UNTIL THEY SMELL

231
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,233
LIKE OLD FISH AND THEN

232
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:16,535
YOU THROW THEM OUT.

233
00:07:16,535 --> 00:07:17,703
WELL YOU DON'T NEED TO THROW

234
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:18,937
THEM OUT WE CAN USE THEM

235
00:07:18,937 --> 00:07:19,971
HERE AS AN ADHESIVE TO

236
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:21,640
STICK THE FOIL BAGS

237
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:30,349
RIGHT ONTO THE UMBRELLA.

238
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:33,251
OH THERE WE ARE 39,

239
00:07:33,251 --> 00:07:34,152
YOU KNOW I'M USING THE

240
00:07:34,152 --> 00:07:36,321
PAINT LIKE WALLPAPER PASTE

241
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:37,489
ACTUALLY I DO HAVE SOME

242
00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:38,490
WALLPAPER, OH IT DOESN'T

243
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,391
MATTER THIS IS GOING TO TAKE

244
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:40,392
A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN

245
00:07:40,392 --> 00:07:41,193
I THOUGHT SO WHY DON'T WE

246
00:07:41,193 --> 00:07:42,227
JUST GET ON WITH THE SHOW

247
00:07:42,227 --> 00:07:43,462
AND WHEN I GET HER ALL DONE

248
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:44,796
I'LL BRING YOU RIGHT BACK

249
00:07:44,796 --> 00:07:48,366
HOOK HER UP AND MAKE HER WORK,

250
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:49,000
WELL THAT'S 39.

251
00:07:53,004 --> 00:07:53,972
>>HAROLD: AND NOW HERE'S

252
00:07:53,972 --> 00:07:54,906
THE PART OF THE SHOW

253
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:55,907
WHERE WE EXPOSE THOSE

254
00:07:55,907 --> 00:07:56,775
3 LITTLE WORDS THAT MEN

255
00:07:56,775 --> 00:07:57,576
FIND SO DIFFICULT TO SAY

256
00:07:57,576 --> 00:07:59,411
'I DON'T KNOW'

257
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:00,479
AND HERE TO PROVE THAT POINT

258
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,313
ONCE AGAIN ON THE EXPERT

259
00:08:01,313 --> 00:08:02,247
PORTION OF THE SHOW

260
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:04,683
IS MY UNCLE RED AND

261
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:18,830

262
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,598
>>HAROLD: OKAY HERE WE GO

263
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:21,833
'DEAR EXPERTS, THERE IS

264
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,168
A WOMAN AT OUR OFFICE WHO

265
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:24,569
I FIND VERY INTERESTING AND

266
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:25,770
I WOULD LIKE VERY MUCH TO

267
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:32,344
MARRY HER AND BEAR HER CHILDREN

268
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:33,345
HOWEVER BEFORE MAKING

269
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:34,713
A LIFE LONG COMMITMENT

270
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:37,549
I THINK WE SHOULD MEET FIRST.

271
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:38,416
SO FAR SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW

272
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,720
THAT I'M ALIVE, ANY IDEAS?'

273

275
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:44,489
I DON'T THINK THE GUY'S

276
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:45,690
ALIVE EITHER.

277
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,625
>>HAROLD: WELL UNCLE RED

278
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:47,626
I DON'T THINK SARCASM HELPS

00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:51,930
A SHY PERSON, BELIEVE ME.

280
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:52,831
>>RED: WELL HAROLD WITH ME

281
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:53,698
YOU'VE EITHER GOT SARCASM

282
00:08:53,698 --> 00:08:56,434
OR TOTAL SILENCE.

283
00:08:56,434 --> 00:08:57,235
>>DOUGIE: HAS HE GOT

284
00:08:57,235 --> 00:09:04,209

>>HAROLD: I DON'T KNOW

286
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:05,844
IT'S KIND OF HARD TO TELL

00:09:05,844 --> 00:09:06,745

288
00:09:06,745 --> 00:09:09,114

TO A THRUSH YOU KNOW OR GET

292
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:15,520

YOU KNOW MAYBE HE MIGHT WANT

320
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:02,567
TO DROP A RACING CAN IN HER

321

TO PUT IN A GRIEVANCE

789

$15 A TRIP PLUS EXPENSES

800
00:22:21,537 --> 00:22:22,505
BUT I THINK MOOSE WOULD

801
00:22:22,505 --> 00:22:25,941
HAVE PAID TWICE THAT MUCH

802
00:22:25,941 --> 00:22:26,675

827
00:23:03,846 --> 00:23:04,680
THAT HASN'T BEEN LOST IN

828
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,282
ANYBODY WHOSE BEEN WATCHING

829
00:23:06,282 --> 00:23:07,016

HOW I GOT INVOLVED WITH THIS

837
00:23:16,325 --> 00:23:17,426
