TO A FAMOUS BATTLE

THE WAR OF 1812,

WHICH WAS ALSO THE SCORE...

WE GOT 18,
THEY GOT 12.

5
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:14,280
EVERY YEAR, DOZENS OF TOURISTS
COME TO VISIT THIS MONUMENT.

6
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:15,782
TODAY I'M ONE OF THEM.

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,884
AND LIKE EVERYONE WHO TRAVELS,
YOU WANNA GO HOME

WITH A PICTURE OF YOURSELF
STANDING IN FRONT OF
THE DARNED THING.

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,455
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS

10
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,325
YOU'VE GOT TO STOP A STRANGER
IN SOME PLACE YOU'VE
NEVER BEEN BEFORE

11
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,093
AND ASK THEM TO TAKE
YOUR PHOTOGRAPH.

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,661
AND BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN
TAKE THE PICTURE,

13
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:30,597
YOU'VE GOT TO TRAIN THEM
HOW TO OPERATE A PIECE
OF EQUIPMENT

14
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:33,666
THAT YOU BARELY
UNDERSTAND YOURSELF.

15
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,468
THEN YOU STAND THERE
LIKE A WEINER

16
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,303
WHILE THIS GOOF TAKES
A PICTURE OF YOUR FEET

WITH HIS THUMB
OVER THE LENS.
