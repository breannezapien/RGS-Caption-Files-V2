00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:49,182
SEEN A TELEVISION SHOW

10
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:49,983

BEEN A TELEVISION LIKE THIS ONE.

WELL, LET'S HOPE THAT'S BECAUSE

14
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:54,754
NO ONE'S EVER THOUGHT OF IT

00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:56,322
RATHER THAN, LIKE, SIMPLY THEY

16
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:58,124
DISMISSED THE WHOLE CONCEPT.

17
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,526
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT'D BE WORSE?

18
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:00,460

I GO ON MY OWN TV SHOW

75
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,120
SO PUT A SMILE

76
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,757
ON THAT LONG, LONG FACE

77
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,292
UNLESS YOU'RE A MOLE

78
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:40,660
IN WHICH CASE I APOLOGIZE

79
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,796

81
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:40,319
ON HANDYMAN CORNER,

82
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,620
WE'RE GONNA SHOW YOU

83
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,222
ABOUT SOME OF THE INJURIES

84
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:44,757
THAT CAN HAPPEN WITH BOATING.

85
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,392
NOW, YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL.

86
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,526
YOU GOT TO WEAR A HARD HAT WHEN

87
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:48,994
YOU'RE FIGHTING DINGHIES,

88
00:03:48,994 --> 00:03:50,696

00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,365
IN CANOES AND STUFF.

91
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,532
AND, OF COURSE, UP AT THE LODGE

92
00:03:53,532 --> 00:03:55,434
NOW, YOU CAN GET INJURED

93
00:03:55,434 --> 00:03:56,368
JUST STRADDLING A BOAT.

94
00:03:56,368 --> 00:03:57,336
WE GET--WE GET A LOT OF

95
00:03:57,336 --> 00:03:59,872
STRADDLING INJURIES UP THERE.

96
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,906
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

97
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:02,041
PEOPLE DON'T TALK ABOUT

98
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:02,908
ALL THAT MUCH

99
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:04,577
IS THE TYPE OF INJURY YOU GET

100
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,544
WHEN YOU'RE WINCHING

101
00:04:05,544 --> 00:04:06,378
A LARGE BOAT OUT OF THE WATER.

102
00:04:06,378 --> 00:04:07,847
SO I THOUGHT I'D JUST SHOW YOU

103
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:08,814
TODAY IN THE HANDYMAN CORNER--

104
00:04:08,814 --> 00:04:09,949
LET'S JUST PRETEND NOW

105
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,884
THAT THIS IS THE LAKE.

106
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,819
IT'S THE SAME COLOR AS THE LAKE.

107
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:15,187
AND WE'LL PRETEND THAT THIS

108
00:04:15,187 --> 00:04:16,322
CANOE HERE IS A--

109
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,590
IS A LARGE BOAT.

110
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,791
FIRST THING YOU DO IS, YOU--

111
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,426
YOU FIND THE BOW OF THE BOAT,

112
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,127
WHICH IS THE FRONT.

113
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,561
THEY CALL IT THE BOW.

114
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:24,063
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

115
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,966
BUT THERE'LL BE A RING THERE.

116
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,133
NO, THAT'S--

117
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:29,602
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

118
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,003
THIS IS--THIS IS THE BOW HERE.

119
00:04:31,003 --> 00:04:32,071
YOU CAN SEE THE RING.

120
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,639
YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE--THAT'S

121
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,840
THE TROUBLE WITH CANOES;

122
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,575
THEY LOOK THE SAME WAY

123
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:38,177
FROM BOTH ENDS.

124
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:39,778
I HAD AN AUNT LIKE THAT.

125
00:04:39,778 --> 00:04:41,714
THIS IS OUR TRAILER,

126
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:44,717
AND WHAT IT'S GOT UP HERE IS,

127
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:48,654
THIS IS CALLED THE TONGUE.

128
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:49,688
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

129
00:04:49,688 --> 00:04:51,223
YOU KNOW, IT'S SLIPPERY.

130
00:04:51,223 --> 00:04:51,924
IT'S UNDERWATER

131
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:52,992
MOST OF THE TIME.

132
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,460
MAYBE THAT'S IT; I DON'T KNOW.

133
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,961
AND THIS, THIS IS WHAT I WANTED

134
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:56,762
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

135
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:58,731
THIS IS CALLED THE WINCH.

136
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,866
THIS IS HOW WE GET THE BOAT

137
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:02,001
UP ON TRAILER, BUT THERE'S

138
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,002
A LOT OF WORK INVOLVED,

139
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:04,436
AND IT'S VERY DANGEROUS,

140
00:05:04,436 --> 00:05:06,338
BECAUSE THE THING CAN BREAK,

141
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:07,740
OR YOU CAN HURT YOUR ARM,

142
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,042
OR YOU CAN JUST GET BORED.

143
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:12,244
SO I'VE GOT A BETTER WAY,

144
00:05:12,244 --> 00:05:13,779
A DIFFERENT WAY TO GET

145
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:17,783
THAT BOAT UP ON THE TRAILER.

146
00:05:17,783 --> 00:05:19,251
ALL RIGHT, WHAT I'VE DONE IS

147
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:21,320
INSTALLED A ONE-TON POWER WINCH

148
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,822
INTO THE FRONT SEAT OF THE VAN.

149
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:25,557
IT'S AN ATTRACTIVE INSTALLATION,

150
00:05:25,557 --> 00:05:26,525
I THINK.

151
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:27,893
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING HERE

152
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:29,094
IS THAT IT'S WIRED INTO

153
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:30,896
THE ALTERNATOR OF THE VAN

154
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:32,331
AND VERY, VERY SAFE.

155
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:33,232
YOU'RE A LONG WAY

156
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,166
FROM THE ACTION BACK THERE,

157
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,267
AND THERE'S NO EFFORT INVOLVED.

158
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:36,568
YOU RIG THIS AS A CONTROL BOX,

159
00:05:36,568 --> 00:05:37,836
YOU PUSH THE BUTTON, AND YOU

160
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:38,804
WINCH THE BOAT UP THERE

161
00:05:38,804 --> 00:05:39,638
JUST AS SAFE AND SOUND

162
00:05:39,638 --> 00:05:40,706
AS YOU PLEASE.

163
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:42,708
[winch rattling]

164
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:26,552
HELLO.

165
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,687
WELL, OF COURSE NONE OF THIS

166
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:29,421
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED

167
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:31,089
IF I'D HAD A SPOTTER.

168
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:33,125
ANYWAY, REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN

169
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,426
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME, THEY

170
00:06:34,426 --> 00:06:37,863
SHOULD AT LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

171
00:06:37,863 --> 00:06:39,831
HAROLD!

172
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:41,433
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE OF

173
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:43,035
THE WELL-DIGGING ADVENTURE

174
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:43,969
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ENJOY

175
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:44,703
MY STORIES.

176
00:06:44,703 --> 00:06:45,571
>> OH, I DIDN'T KNOW

177
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,905
YOUR WIFE WAS WATCHING.

178
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:49,207
HI, AUNT BERNICE.

179
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:05,357
>> "IT IS AUTUMN.

180
00:07:05,357 --> 00:07:07,225
500 GEESE ARE FLYING SOUTH

181
00:07:07,225 --> 00:07:09,328
IN A GIANT WEDGE FORMATION

182
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,530
LIKE A HUGE PIECE OF PIZZA,

183
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,332
SHADES OF MUSHROOM AND PEPPERONI

184
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,232
AND ANCHOVIES.

185
00:07:14,232 --> 00:07:15,534
AND AS THEY TRAVEL,

186
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:16,501
THEY DROP THE TOPPINGS

187
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:18,470
THAT THEY DON'T LIKE."

188
00:07:19,905 --> 00:07:21,707
WELL, AS I NEVER GOT A CHANCE

189
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:23,775
TO MENTION EARLIER, WE HAD

190
00:07:23,775 --> 00:07:24,843
A LITTLE PROBLEM WITH THE WELL

191
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:26,111
UP AT THE LODGE YESTERDAY.

192
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:27,012
SHE WASN'T ANY PUMPING ANY

193
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:28,814
WATER, AND RATHER THAN HAVE TO

194
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:30,782
GO DOWN THERE AND FIX THE WASHER

195
00:07:30,782 --> 00:07:32,818
ON THE FOOT VALVE, WE FIGURED

196
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:33,685
IT'D BE EASIER

197
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:35,320
JUST TO DIG ANOTHER WELL.

198
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,822
WE WERE GONNA DO IT BY HAND,

199
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:38,423
BUT THEN WE FOUND THE SHOVEL.

200
00:07:38,423 --> 00:07:39,357
WE FIGURED

201
00:07:39,357 --> 00:07:40,525
WE'D GET STINKY PETERSON

202
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:41,493
TO DIG THE WELL, 'CAUSE HE'S

203
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:42,427
THE SKINNIEST, AND THAT WAY

204
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:43,595
THERE'D BE A LOT LESS

205
00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:44,296
OF A HOLE TO WORK ON.

206
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:45,363
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

207
00:07:45,363 --> 00:07:47,466
MAKE IT EASIER ON EVERYBODY.

208
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:48,600
STINKY HAD A PROBLEM SEEING

209
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,669
THE LOGIC, BUT HE'S LIKE THAT.

210
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:51,903
SO WE DID WHAT THE--WHAT THE

211
00:07:51,903 --> 00:07:52,804
PROFESSIONAL WORK CREWS DO.

212
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:54,439
WE JUST KIND OF SAT IN A RING

213
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,340
AROUND STINKY

214
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,808
AND WATCHED HIM WORK.

215
00:07:56,808 --> 00:07:57,776
HE SEEMED TO ENJOY

216
00:07:57,776 --> 00:07:58,944
THE ENCOURAGEMENT AND GAVE HIM

217
00:07:58,944 --> 00:08:00,612
SOMETHING TO THROW THE DIRT AT.

218
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:01,880
>> UNCLE RED, UNCLE RED.

219
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,814
THIS IS SUCH, LIKE,

220
00:08:02,814 --> 00:08:03,748
A GREAT STORY, RIGHT?

221
00:08:03,748 --> 00:08:04,950
YOU KNOW, WHAT I SUGGEST IS THAT

222
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,084
WE COME BACK TO IT LATER.

223
00:08:06,084 --> 00:08:06,985
THAT WAY, THE VIEWER

224
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:07,819
WON'T TURN US OFF

225
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:08,753
AS SOON YOU'RE FINISHED

226
00:08:08,753 --> 00:08:09,621
OR, EVEN WORSE,

227
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:11,022
BEFORE YOU'RE FINISHED, RIGHT?

228
00:08:11,022 --> 00:08:11,957
SO LET'S JUST GO

229
00:08:11,957 --> 00:08:14,125
TO ANOTHER SEGMENT.

230
00:08:15,827 --> 00:08:17,028
>> NO, THANKS, HAROLD.

231
00:08:17,028 --> 00:08:18,196
I'D RATHER JUST KIND OF CARRY ON

232
00:08:18,196 --> 00:08:19,664
WITH THE STORY NOW.

233
00:08:19,664 --> 00:08:20,699
>> [laughs]

234
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:23,368
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

235
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,439
>> BOB.

236
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,940
>> OH, HI, RED.

237
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,808
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

238
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:30,876
>> YEAH, I FIGURED YOU'D BE

240
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:32,510
OUT IN THE FAIRWAY.

241
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,145
>> ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER DOLLAR,

242
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:34,980
YOU KNOW.

243
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,814
>> WELL, THAT'S NOT

244
00:08:35,814 --> 00:08:36,681
THE GREEN FEE, IS IT?

245
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:37,749
>> NO, NO, RED.

246
00:08:37,749 --> 00:08:39,017
NO, I'M WORKING

247
00:08:39,017 --> 00:08:40,919
FOR THE DEPARTMENT TODAY.

248
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,654
UM...

249
00:08:42,654 --> 00:08:43,922
STUDYING CLOUD PATTERNS,

250
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:45,223
YOU KNOW.

251
00:08:45,223 --> 00:08:46,524
SEE THOSE STRATO-NIMBULUS

252
00:08:46,524 --> 00:08:47,459
OVER THERE?

253
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:48,493
THAT'S SOME HIGH PRESSURE

254
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:49,327
MOVING IN.

255
00:08:49,327 --> 00:08:50,929
>> YEAH, WELL, ANYWAY,

256
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:51,663
BOB, WE'RE THINKING ABOUT

257
00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:52,564
PUTTING INDOOR PLUMBING

258
00:08:52,564 --> 00:08:53,398
INTO THE LODGE?

259
00:08:53,398 --> 00:08:54,165
>> HMM.

260
00:08:54,165 --> 00:08:55,367
>> AND WE GOT TO PUT

261
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:56,835
A SEPTIC THING.

262
00:08:56,835 --> 00:08:57,702
WE GOT THE FORM HERE,

263
00:08:57,702 --> 00:08:58,503
AND THERE'S A LOT OF PAPERWORK

264
00:08:58,503 --> 00:08:59,270
TO IT, AND I THOUGHT,

265
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,105
YOU KNOW, SINCE YOU'RE A MEMBER

266
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:01,473

00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:03,575
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU COULD

269
00:09:03,575 --> 00:09:05,176
HELP ME OUT WITH THIS.

270
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:07,646
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW, RED.

271
00:09:07,646 --> 00:09:09,481
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT REALLY INTO

273
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,151
APPROVAL THING, YOU KNOW.

OH, THANKS.

275
00:09:14,552 --> 00:09:16,988
NO, MY DEPARTMENT IS WILDLIFE

284
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,664
YEAH, AS YOU SAY, YEAH.

00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:29,300
NO, NO, NO, NO.

288
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,368
NOT GOLF.

289
00:09:30,368 --> 00:09:33,304
I DO THAT JUST FOR FUN.

290
00:09:33,304 --> 00:09:35,306
YEAH, I'M OUT HERE NOW AND THEN.

291
00:09:35,306 --> 00:09:36,875
>> WELL, IT'S ABOUT SEVEN DAYS

292
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,843
A WEEK, I THINK.

293
00:09:38,843 --> 00:09:39,878
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW

294
00:09:39,878 --> 00:09:40,912
ABOUT THAT.

295
00:09:40,912 --> 00:09:42,847
NO, NOT SEVEN DAYS.

296
00:09:42,847 --> 00:09:43,915
THERE'S SOME DAYS

297
00:09:43,915 --> 00:09:45,150
I COME OUT HERE, I DON'T PLAY.

298
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,651
>> WHAT DAY?

299
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:48,419
>> IT'S IN FEBRUARY.

300
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:49,854
THE 30TH, I THINK.

301
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:51,689
>> HMM.

302
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:52,824
>> OH, HEY.

HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY YOU AND I

SEE IF THERE'S A STORM BREWING

310
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,401
OR SOMETHING?

311
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:04,869
>> NO, I CAN'T DO THAT, BOB.

312
00:10:04,869 --> 00:10:06,538
I'VE ALREADY RENTED THE BACKHOE

I DON'T EVEN HAVE ANY CLUBS.

323
00:10:17,982 --> 00:10:19,183
>> WELL, LOOK.

342
00:10:54,118 --> 00:10:55,987
I CAN'T EVEN PLAY THAT.

343
00:10:55,987 --> 00:11:00,158
>> SO WHAT ABOUT THIS FORM, BOB?

344
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:01,359
CAN YOU HELP ME OUT

345
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:02,527
WITH THE FORM AT ALL?

346
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,863
>> OH, RIGHT, YEAH.

347
00:11:05,863 --> 00:11:09,400
LOOK AT THAT.

348
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,401
WELL, RED, THIS IS

349
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:11,469
PRETTY COMPLICATED, YOU KNOW--

350
00:11:11,469 --> 00:11:12,437
>> WELL, YEAH, I KNOW.

351
00:11:12,437 --> 00:11:13,538
THAT'S WHY--

352
00:11:13,538 --> 00:11:14,372
>> WELL, THIS'LL TAKE ME

353
00:11:14,372 --> 00:11:16,441
ABOUT--ABOUT 50 MINUTES.

354
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:17,241
>> 50?

355
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:18,976
>> I DON'T KNOW; WITH PULLING

356
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:20,078
THOSE TWO GOLF CLUBS AROUND

357
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:21,412
AND THE WEATHER REPORT

358
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:22,947
I GOT TO FILL OUT,

359
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:24,449
MIGHT TAKE ME ALL DAY.

360
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:25,383
>> I GOT AN IDEA HERE.

361
00:11:25,383 --> 00:11:26,384
>> HMM?

362
00:11:26,384 --> 00:11:27,351
>> MAYBE IT IS A GREAT DAY

363
00:11:27,351 --> 00:11:28,219
FOR GOLF, HUH?

364
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:30,888
>> IT SURE IS, RED.

365
00:11:30,888 --> 00:11:32,457
THAT'S WONDERFUL!

366
00:11:32,457 --> 00:11:33,624
THE DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL

367
00:11:33,624 --> 00:11:34,592
RESOURCES IS REALLY GONNA

368
00:11:34,592 --> 00:11:35,626
APPRECIATE THIS.

369
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:36,561
>> OH, AND TELL YOU WHAT.

370
00:11:36,561 --> 00:11:37,528
LET'S NOT COUNT THAT ONE.

371
00:11:37,528 --> 00:11:38,496
>> HEY, YOU'RE RIGHT.

372
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:39,797
>> YOU JUST GO AHEAD.

373
00:11:39,797 --> 00:11:40,765
I'LL HANG ONTO THAT.

374
00:11:40,765 --> 00:11:41,666
>> YEAH, YOU HANG ON.

375
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:42,700
>> WE'LL DO THIS, THOUGH, RIGHT?

376
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,768
>> OH, YEAH, WE'LL GET TO THAT.

377
00:11:43,768 --> 00:11:44,569
I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT

378
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:45,503
AT ALL.

379
00:11:45,503 --> 00:11:46,270
NO, SIR.

380
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,705
>> OKAY, WATCH THE TOP SPIN, EH?

381
00:11:47,705 --> 00:11:48,706
>> TOP SPIN, YEAH,

382
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:49,373
I GOT TO WATCH THAT.

383
00:11:49,373 --> 00:11:50,408
KEEP MY HEAD DOWN.

384
00:11:50,408 --> 00:11:51,476
>> YEAH, YEAH.

385
00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:52,143
YEAH.

386
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:53,578
>> THAT'S THE KEY, YOU KNOW.

387
00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:54,512
>> YEAH.

388
00:11:54,512 --> 00:11:55,713
>> AH, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

389
00:11:55,713 --> 00:11:56,414
A GOOD TIME.

390
00:11:56,414 --> 00:11:57,615
I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I KNOW TOO,

391
00:11:57,615 --> 00:11:58,783
RED.

392
00:11:58,783 --> 00:12:00,084
>> ALL RIGHT.

393
00:12:00,084 --> 00:12:01,352
50 MINUTES, HUH?

394
00:12:01,352 --> 00:12:03,120
>> YEAH, 50 MINUTES.

395
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,322
FORE!

396
00:12:04,322 --> 00:12:05,122
OH!

397
00:12:05,122 --> 00:12:06,057
[water splashes]

398
00:12:06,057 --> 00:12:07,258
DARN!

399
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:08,526
LOOK AT THAT.

400
00:12:08,526 --> 00:12:09,293
I MEAN, THAT'S NO BETTER

401
00:12:09,293 --> 00:12:10,394
THAN THAT ONE.

402
00:12:10,394 --> 00:12:11,362
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I THINK

403
00:12:11,362 --> 00:12:12,196
YOU MAY HAVE OVERCLEANED

404
00:12:12,196 --> 00:12:12,897
THAT BALL.

405
00:12:12,897 --> 00:12:13,831
>> OH, I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

406
00:12:13,831 --> 00:12:14,699
THAT'S PROBABLY IT.

407
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:15,399
>> YEAH.

408
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,934
LET ME GIVE HER A GO HERE.

409
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:18,369
>> JUST CLEAN THOSE BALLS WAY

410
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:19,470
TOO MUCH SOMETIME, YOU KNOW?

411
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,271
>> YEAH.

412
00:12:20,271 --> 00:12:21,105
>> NOW, KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN.

413
00:12:21,105 --> 00:12:22,073
>> YEAH, YOU MIGHT WANT TO KEEP

414
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:22,840
YOURS DOWN TOO THERE, BOB.

415
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,808
>> OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

416
00:12:23,808 --> 00:12:25,843
OF COURSE.

417
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:31,415
>> WELL, LOOK AT THAT.

418
00:12:31,415 --> 00:12:32,917
THAT'S VERY NICE, RED.

419
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:34,051
VERY, VERY NICE.

420
00:12:34,051 --> 00:12:34,852
>> OH, BOB.

421
00:12:34,852 --> 00:12:35,953
I HIT THAT LITTLE FLAGPOLE

422
00:12:35,953 --> 00:12:37,054
ON THE GREEN.

423
00:12:37,054 --> 00:12:38,956
IS THERE A PENALTY FOR THAT?

424
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:40,124
>> NO, WE'LL BEND THE RULES

425
00:12:40,124 --> 00:12:42,526
JUST A LITTLE BIT, RED.

426
00:12:42,526 --> 00:12:44,195
>> ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

427
00:12:44,195 --> 00:12:45,529
>> OH, MY GOODNESS.

428
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:47,264
LOOKS LIKE IT'S GONNA RAIN.

429
00:12:47,264 --> 00:12:48,399
MIGHT HAVE TO CUT THE GAME

430
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,834
SHORT, YOU KNOW.

431
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:52,470
>> WELL, WHATEVER.

432
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,539
>> MY LEG'S ACTING UP TOO.

433
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,641
>> IF I HAVE

434
00:12:57,641 --> 00:12:59,810
A BIG, IMPORTANT JOB TO DO

435
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,612
THE KIND OF JOB

436
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:03,547
I'D RATHER NOT DO

437
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:05,149
I HAVE A LITTLE TRICK

438
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:07,118
AND I'LL TEACH IT TO YOU

439
00:13:07,118 --> 00:13:08,986
TO MAKE THE JOB GO

440
00:13:08,986 --> 00:13:10,488
BOPPITY BOO

441
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:14,024
WALK AWAY, WALK AWAY

442
00:13:14,024 --> 00:13:15,559
LEAVE THE DAMN JOB

443
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,528
FOR ANOTHER DAY

444
00:13:17,528 --> 00:13:19,096
CUT YOURSELF SOME SLACK

445
00:13:19,096 --> 00:13:21,065
HAVE A COLD ONE, HAVE A NAP

446
00:13:21,065 --> 00:13:22,600
ANY JOB THAT'S URGENT

447
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,434
WILL BE THERE

448
00:13:23,434 --> 00:13:24,568
WHEN YOU GET BACK

449
00:13:24,568 --> 00:13:25,770
JUST TELL YOUR BOSS YOU'RE

450
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:26,704
NOT SUFFICIENTLY MOTIVATED

451
00:13:26,704 --> 00:13:27,638
TO ACCEPT

452
00:13:27,638 --> 00:13:29,406
THIS PARTICULAR CHALLENGE

453
00:13:29,406 --> 00:13:30,908
ANYWAY, IF IT WAS A GOOD JOB

454
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:31,976
THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY WORK

455
00:13:31,976 --> 00:13:32,676
CONNECTED TO IT

456
00:13:32,676 --> 00:13:34,945
WOULD THERE?

457
00:13:38,749 --> 00:13:40,317
>> OOH!

458
00:13:40,317 --> 00:13:41,685
>> YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL

459
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:42,620
WHEN BILL DROPS BY,

460
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,487
BECAUSE YOU'RE USUALLY

461
00:13:43,487 --> 00:13:44,822
IN A LOT OF PAIN.

462
00:13:44,822 --> 00:13:45,890
YOU ALWAYS HURT

463
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,057
THE ONE YOU LOVE, AND BILL

464
00:13:47,057 --> 00:13:49,193
MUST BE CRAZY ABOUT ME.

465
00:13:49,193 --> 00:13:50,794
ANYWAY, WHAT HAPPENED WAS,

466
00:13:50,794 --> 00:13:51,662
HIS ROPE WAS HOOKED

467
00:13:51,662 --> 00:13:52,630
ON A TREE THERE.

468
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,364
WHAT HE WAS GOING TO SHOW US

469
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:55,432
TODAY WAS SOMETHING ABOUT TRAPS

470
00:13:55,432 --> 00:13:56,534
AND SNARES AND EVERYTHING.

471
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:57,535
THIS IS ACTUALLY

472
00:13:57,535 --> 00:13:59,570
AN OFFICIAL TRAP.

473
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,571
I THINK THIS IS FOR RACCOONS

474
00:14:00,571 --> 00:14:01,272
OR WHATEVER.

475
00:14:01,272 --> 00:14:02,306
YOU OPEN THE ONE END, AND

476
00:14:02,306 --> 00:14:03,841
I THINK THE ANIMAL GOES IN,

477
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:04,942
AND THEN WHEN HE GOES IN IT--

478
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:06,243
BUT BILL'S GONNA SHOW YOU HOW

479
00:14:06,243 --> 00:14:08,112
YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN TRAPS.

480
00:14:08,112 --> 00:14:09,079
FIRST OF ALL, HE'S LOOKING

481
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:10,347
FOR TRACKS OF ANIMALS.

482
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:12,016
UH, HE FOUND SOMETHING.

483
00:14:12,016 --> 00:14:12,716
YEP, YEP.

484
00:14:12,716 --> 00:14:14,351
ANIMALS HAVE BEEN HERE.

485
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:16,186
SO THIS IS A GOOD PLACE

486
00:14:16,186 --> 00:14:17,888
TO BUILD A TRAP.

487
00:14:17,888 --> 00:14:19,256
NOW HE STICKS THREE LITTLE

488
00:14:19,256 --> 00:14:20,658
STICKS IN THE GROUND, AND HE

489
00:14:20,658 --> 00:14:22,293
WRAPS THIS LITTLE--LITTLE LINE

490
00:14:22,293 --> 00:14:23,027
AROUND THEM.

491
00:14:23,027 --> 00:14:23,894
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER

492
00:14:23,894 --> 00:14:24,728
THIS IS MAYBE

493
00:14:24,728 --> 00:14:26,163
TO HOOK ONTO THEIR LEG OR--

494
00:14:26,163 --> 00:14:27,631
I WASN'T QUITE SURE.

495
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:28,365
HE DIDN'T EXPLAIN.

496
00:14:28,365 --> 00:14:29,366
DIDN'T TIE THAT KNOT REAL WELL,

497
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:30,167
EITHER.

498
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:31,402
AND THEN HE PULLS THIS DOWN

499
00:14:31,402 --> 00:14:32,536
AND--

500
00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:34,638
>> OOH!

501
00:14:34,638 --> 00:14:35,472
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL,

502
00:14:35,472 --> 00:14:36,840
WHAT HE NEEDS IS A TREE

503
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,808
THAT MAYBE HAS A LITTLE MORE--

504
00:14:37,808 --> 00:14:38,909
A LITTLE MORE SPRING TO IT

505
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:39,777
THAN THAT.

506
00:14:39,777 --> 00:14:41,812
WELL, I GUESS--HE PICKED ONE.

507
00:14:41,812 --> 00:14:43,514
YEAH, MM-HMM, MM-HMM.

508
00:14:43,514 --> 00:14:45,616
SO HE PULLS THIS TREE DOWN.

509
00:14:45,616 --> 00:14:46,617
WE'RE GONNA USE THIS,

510
00:14:46,617 --> 00:14:47,618
AND THIS IS GOING TO BE LIKE

511
00:14:47,618 --> 00:14:49,553
THE SPRING TO MAKE THE--

512
00:14:49,553 --> 00:14:50,821
AND THIS THING REALLY--

513
00:14:50,821 --> 00:14:51,889
THERE WAS A LOT OF PULL TO THEM

514
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:52,856
AND TOOK BOTH OF US

515
00:14:52,856 --> 00:14:54,024
WITH BOTH HANDS GOING.

516
00:14:54,024 --> 00:14:55,159
AND THEN HE WANTED ME

517
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,593
TO TIE THE ROPE ON,

518
00:14:56,593 --> 00:14:57,528
BUT, YOU KNOW, TO TIE

519
00:14:57,528 --> 00:14:58,629
THE ROPE ON, I HAD TO--I HAD

520
00:14:58,629 --> 00:14:59,496
TO LET GO OF THE BRANCH,

521
00:14:59,496 --> 00:15:00,397
WHICH MEANT I WASN'T HOLDING

522
00:15:00,397 --> 00:15:01,298
THE BRANCH DOWN,

523
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:02,366
AND THEN IT WAS JUST--

524
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:03,300
>> [yelling]

525
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,568
>> WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

526
00:15:04,568 --> 00:15:06,603
OH!

527
00:15:06,603 --> 00:15:09,139
>> [crying]

528
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:10,941
>> SO I THOUGHT MAYBE HE WANTED

529
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:12,042
TO USE THIS TREE NOW.

530
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:12,876
HE'LL NEVER GET THAT ONE

531
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:14,011
BENT DOWN.

532
00:15:14,011 --> 00:15:15,345
BUT, NO, HE HAD--

533
00:15:15,345 --> 00:15:16,113
NO, HE HAD SOMETHING--

534
00:15:16,113 --> 00:15:17,081
GONNA TRY SOMETHING ELSE,

535
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:18,048
GONNA TRY SOMETHING ELSE.

536
00:15:18,048 --> 00:15:19,283
YEAH, YEAH.

537
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:20,984
NOW, THIS ONE WAS REALLY

538
00:15:20,984 --> 00:15:21,852
SOMETHING.

539
00:15:21,852 --> 00:15:25,189
HE PUT A LITTLE KNIFE IN THERE,

540
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:28,192
AND THAT BECOMES, I THINK--

541
00:15:28,192 --> 00:15:29,059
I BELIEVE THEY CALL THAT

542
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:29,960
THE FULCRUM.

543
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,061
AND THEN HE HOOKED THAT

544
00:15:31,061 --> 00:15:33,030
ONTO A LITTLE TWIG--

545
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,565
OR MAYBE THERE WAS A NAIL

546
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:35,999
IN THAT TREE FROM SOME SORT OF

547
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:38,035
A PREVIOUS PARTY WE'D HAD--

548
00:15:38,035 --> 00:15:39,903
AND THEN UP TO--I THINK

549
00:15:39,903 --> 00:15:41,238
HE CALLED THAT THE TRIGGER.

550
00:15:41,238 --> 00:15:42,039
I WAS GETTING A LITTLE CONFUSED

551
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:42,906
AT THIS POINT.

552
00:15:42,906 --> 00:15:44,107
HE HAD A LOOP TIED IN THE ROPE.

553
00:15:44,107 --> 00:15:45,742
THEN HE GOT ME TO PICK UP

554
00:15:45,742 --> 00:15:46,877
THIS LOG.

555
00:15:46,877 --> 00:15:49,246
I BELIEVE IT WEIGHED 250 POUND

556
00:15:49,246 --> 00:15:50,480
OR SO, 'CAUSE IT WAS FULL OF

557
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,249
WATER AND STUFF.

558
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:55,319
NOW, BILL WENT DOWN TO HOOK UP

559
00:15:55,319 --> 00:15:56,620
THE LEG PART, AND I WAS TRYING

560
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,421
TO FIGURE OUT

561
00:15:57,421 --> 00:15:58,322
HOW THIS WOULD WORK.

562
00:15:58,322 --> 00:15:59,556
YOU KNOW, I GUESS THE IDEA IS

563
00:15:59,556 --> 00:16:00,591
THAT THE ANIMAL IS SUPPOSED TO

564
00:16:00,591 --> 00:16:01,525
TRIGGER IN THAT LOCK,

565
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:02,593
'CAUSE I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT

566
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:03,427
HOW THE LOG WOULD DO IT

567
00:16:03,427 --> 00:16:04,161
AND FALL, BUT...

568
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:05,862
>> OOH!

569
00:16:05,862 --> 00:16:07,965
>> IT WORKED.

570
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:09,933
SO THEN WHAT HE WANTED TO DO

571
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:11,034
WAS THIS--THIS IS--THIS ONE

572
00:16:11,034 --> 00:16:12,202
I SAW WAS REALLY TERRIFIC.

573
00:16:12,202 --> 00:16:13,804
HE KNOCKED OFF ALL THE LITTLE

574
00:16:13,804 --> 00:16:15,005
BRANCHES AND TWIGS ON THIS

575
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:17,274
BRANCH THAT WAS STICKING OUT.

576
00:16:17,274 --> 00:16:19,042
AND THEN WHAT HE DID WAS,

577
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:20,210
HE TOOK HIS KNIFE,

578
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,545
WHICH IS A PRETTY SERIOUS

579
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:23,213
INSTRUMENT THERE,

580
00:16:23,213 --> 00:16:24,948
AND HE TIED THAT AROUND

581
00:16:24,948 --> 00:16:26,249
THE END OF THE BRANCH,

582
00:16:26,249 --> 00:16:29,853
AND HE TIED HER ON PRETTY GOOD.

583
00:16:29,853 --> 00:16:31,655
MAYBE NOT QUITE AS GOOD AS MAYBE

584
00:16:31,655 --> 00:16:32,990
HE SHOULD HAVE,

585
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,391
BUT HE HAD THAT ON THERE.

586
00:16:34,391 --> 00:16:35,392
AND THEN WHAT HE DOES IS,

587
00:16:35,392 --> 00:16:37,060
HE BACKS THAT UP.

588
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,862
AND AGAIN THE SPRING

589
00:16:38,862 --> 00:16:40,230
IN THESE TREES IS UNBELIEVABLE.

590
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,198
IT WAS A GREEN TREE

591
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:42,699
AND LOT OF FORCE THERE.

592
00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:44,201
HE WAS TRYING TO HOOK IT ONTO

593
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:45,402
SOMETHING, YOU KNOW,

594
00:16:45,402 --> 00:16:46,436
WITH HIS FOOT THEN SLIPPED

595
00:16:46,436 --> 00:16:47,237
AND THEN--

596
00:16:47,237 --> 00:16:48,572
LOOK OUT. LOOK OUT. LOOK OUT.

597
00:16:48,572 --> 00:16:51,675
OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH.

598
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:57,047
I WASN'T REAL HAPPY WITH THAT,

599
00:16:57,047 --> 00:16:59,082
SO I DECIDED TO MAKE KIND OF

600
00:16:59,082 --> 00:17:01,685
A TRAP ALL OF MY OWN.

601
00:17:01,685 --> 00:17:04,354
I ASKED BILL JUST TO STAND THERE

602
00:17:04,354 --> 00:17:05,856
BY THE TREE

603
00:17:05,856 --> 00:17:07,624
AND KIND OF LOOK LIKE BAIT.

604
00:17:07,624 --> 00:17:10,026
AND THEN I WOULD--

605
00:17:10,026 --> 00:17:11,261
THIS IS KIND OF THE MAYPOLE

606
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:14,097
STYLE OF ANIMAL TRAP.

607
00:17:14,097 --> 00:17:15,899
AND THE BEAUTY OF THIS IS THAT

608
00:17:15,899 --> 00:17:16,666
YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME BACK

609
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,669
AND CHECK IT.

610
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:22,672
SEE YOU LATER, BILL.

611
00:17:22,672 --> 00:17:24,508
"IT IS WINTER.

612
00:17:24,508 --> 00:17:27,144
TOES ARE NUMB FROM THE COLD,

613
00:17:27,144 --> 00:17:28,512
LIKE A FAMILY OF ICE CUBES

614
00:17:28,512 --> 00:17:29,546
SHIVERING BESIDE

615
00:17:29,546 --> 00:17:31,681
THEIR BIG FAT MOTHER.

616
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:33,183
FROZEN TOES SCREAMING

617
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,819
IN QUIET PAIN, BUT NO MATTER

618
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:37,120
HOW SORE THEY GET,

619
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,288
I'M NOT PUTTING THEM

620
00:17:38,288 --> 00:17:40,257
IN MY MOUTH."

621
00:17:51,134 --> 00:17:53,236
WELL, HAROLD, I GUESS BY NOW

622
00:17:53,236 --> 00:17:55,005
YOU'VE DISCOVERED GIRLS, HUH?

623
00:17:55,005 --> 00:17:57,007
>> NO, I DIDN'T DISCOVER THEM.

624
00:17:57,007 --> 00:17:58,074
THEY BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME

625
00:17:58,074 --> 00:18:00,076
BEFORE ME.

626
00:18:00,076 --> 00:18:01,077
>> NO, I MEAN--I MEAN, YOU'RE

627
00:18:01,077 --> 00:18:01,845
STARTING TO GET INTERESTED

628
00:18:01,845 --> 00:18:02,612
IN GIRLS.

629
00:18:02,612 --> 00:18:03,480
>> OH, YEAH.

630
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,781
[laughs]

631
00:18:04,781 --> 00:18:05,949
THAT'S PUTTING IT MILDLY.

632
00:18:05,949 --> 00:18:07,684
I'M SWIMMING IN HORMONES.

633
00:18:07,684 --> 00:18:09,552
I'M SWIMMING IN THEM, UNCLE RED.

634
00:18:09,552 --> 00:18:10,587
I'M DROWNING IN THEM, AND

635
00:18:10,587 --> 00:18:11,855
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO DO.

636
00:18:11,855 --> 00:18:14,291
>> WEAR A SNORKEL.

637
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,126
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

638
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:18,161
>> I'M NOT REALLY SURE.

639
00:18:18,161 --> 00:18:19,162
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, HAROLD,

640
00:18:19,162 --> 00:18:19,963
YOU KNOW.

641
00:18:19,963 --> 00:18:20,797
THERE'S GONNA COME A TIME

642
00:18:20,797 --> 00:18:21,531
PRETTY SOON

643
00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:22,999
WHEN YOU'RE GONNA REALIZE

644
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:24,000
THERE'S A LOT MORE TO LIFE

645
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,035
THAN THINKING ABOUT SEX.

646
00:18:25,035 --> 00:18:25,902
>> OH, GOOD.

647
00:18:25,902 --> 00:18:26,836
WHEN DOES THAT TIME COME,

648
00:18:26,836 --> 00:18:28,238
UNCLE RED?

649
00:18:28,238 --> 00:18:30,273
>> WELL, I'M TOLD

650
00:18:30,273 --> 00:18:31,808
IT'S JUST IN THOSE FEW MINUTES

651
00:18:31,808 --> 00:18:32,842
BEFORE YOU DIE.

652
00:18:32,842 --> 00:18:36,212
NO ONE REALLY KNOWS.

653
00:18:36,212 --> 00:18:37,580
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK

654
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,549
TO END THE WELL-DIGGING SAGA.

655
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:40,617
>> AND I'LL BE HERE

656
00:18:40,617 --> 00:18:41,751
TO PROTECT YOUR INTERESTS.

657
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:44,854
REST EASY, COMPADRES.

658
00:18:54,631 --> 00:18:55,732
>> WE'RE OUT HERE WITH

659
00:18:55,732 --> 00:18:57,767
MY GOOD BUDDY DOUGIE FRANKLIN

660
00:18:57,767 --> 00:18:59,169
AND WHAT HAS TO BE

661
00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:00,837
ONE OF THE LARGEST

662
00:19:00,837 --> 00:19:02,172
FOUR-WHEELED VEHICLES

663
00:19:02,172 --> 00:19:03,473
IN THIS COUNTRY, I BELIEVE.

664
00:19:03,473 --> 00:19:04,674
>> WELL, THAT MEANS A LOT

665
00:19:04,674 --> 00:19:05,809
COMING FROM YOU, RED.

666
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:06,743
IT REALLY DOES.

667
00:19:06,743 --> 00:19:07,811
I APPRECIATE THAT.

668
00:19:07,811 --> 00:19:09,145
BUT, YOU KNOW, SHE'S MORE

669
00:19:09,145 --> 00:19:10,313
THAN A TRUCK TO ME.

670
00:19:10,313 --> 00:19:13,049
SHE'S--SHE'S A WIFE.

671
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:16,553
SHE'S A WIFE AND KIDS.

672
00:19:16,553 --> 00:19:18,488
A WIFE, KIDS, AND FAMILY,

673
00:19:18,488 --> 00:19:19,589
AS WELL AS A JOB.

674
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:21,024
SHE'S A WIFE, KID, FAMILY,

675
00:19:21,024 --> 00:19:23,259
A JOB, AND FRIENDS.

676
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:24,561
SHE'S MY FRIEND.

677
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:26,396
THIS TRUCK'S MY LIFE.

678
00:19:26,396 --> 00:19:27,463
>> I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE

679
00:19:27,463 --> 00:19:29,299
THAT YOU CALLED HER "SHE," DOUG.

680
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:30,433
WHY IS THAT?

681
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:32,802
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, RED, THAT'S--

682
00:19:32,802 --> 00:19:34,671
THAT'D BE ONE OF YOUR OLD

683
00:19:34,671 --> 00:19:37,574
NAVY-TYPE TERMS, AND I WAS

684
00:19:37,574 --> 00:19:39,375
IN THE NAVY THERE FOR ABOUT--

685
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,377
WELL, WELL, IT WASN'T REALLY

686
00:19:41,377 --> 00:19:42,245
THE NAVY.

687
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:43,246
IT WAS NAVAL RESERVE.

688
00:19:43,246 --> 00:19:44,080
I WAS IN THERE

689
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,982
FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS.

690
00:19:45,982 --> 00:19:47,483
WELL, IT WAS TWO AND A HALF.

691
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:49,319
I JUST ROUNDED HER OFF SOME.

692
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:51,654
ANYWAY, I'M THINKING ON CHANGING

693
00:19:51,654 --> 00:19:53,156
THE OIL RIGHT ABOUT NOW,

694
00:19:53,156 --> 00:19:54,090
IF YOU WANT TO STICK AROUND.

695
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,692
>> I SAW YOU HAD THE--I SAW

696
00:19:55,692 --> 00:19:56,593
YOU HAD THE--SAW YOU HAD

697
00:19:56,593 --> 00:19:57,360
THE HOOD OFF.

698
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,995
>> YEAH, YEAH, I DID.

699
00:19:58,995 --> 00:19:59,862
WELL, YOU GOT TO DO THAT

700
00:19:59,862 --> 00:20:00,697
TO CHANGE THE OIL.

701
00:20:00,697 --> 00:20:01,464
>> YEAH.

702
00:20:01,464 --> 00:20:03,199
>> IF YOU COULD JUST GET--HELP

703
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,701
GIVE ME A BOOST UP THERE, I'M

704
00:20:04,701 --> 00:20:06,035
NOT AS AGILE AS I USED TO BE.

705
00:20:06,035 --> 00:20:07,837
JUST HOLD YOUR HAND LIKE THAT,

706
00:20:07,837 --> 00:20:08,938
AND I'LL JUST USE THAT

707
00:20:08,938 --> 00:20:10,540
AS, LIKE, A STEPPING THING.

708
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,474
THERE YOU GO.

709
00:20:11,474 --> 00:20:12,375
JUST WIPE YOUR HANDS OFF.

710
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,309
DON'T WANT TO GRIND ANYTHING

711
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:14,344
INTO HER.

712
00:20:14,344 --> 00:20:15,311
OKAY, YOU READY?

713
00:20:15,311 --> 00:20:16,713
>> UP YOU GO.

714
00:20:16,713 --> 00:20:19,082
OH, SORRY.

715
00:20:19,082 --> 00:20:20,616
YEAH, YOU GOT HER?

716
00:20:20,616 --> 00:20:21,784
>> BOY, YOU'RE--YOU BEEN

717
00:20:21,784 --> 00:20:25,588
WORKING OUT THERE, RED?

718
00:20:25,588 --> 00:20:27,990
OKAY.

719
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,059
NOW LET'S JUST HAVE A LOOK.

720
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:31,361
>> SHE--SHE BURN A LOT OF OIL

721
00:20:31,361 --> 00:20:32,328
THERE, DOUGIE?

722
00:20:32,328 --> 00:20:35,465
>> WELL, RED, NO, BUT, YOU KNOW,

723
00:20:35,465 --> 00:20:36,466
SHE LEAKS A BIT.

724
00:20:36,466 --> 00:20:37,767
FOUND THAT OUT THE OTHER NIGHT

725
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:40,436
WHEN I SLEPT UNDER HER.

726
00:20:40,436 --> 00:20:41,671
>> DO YOU GET A LOT OF

727
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:42,905
NOSEBLEEDS SITTING UP THAT HIGH

728
00:20:42,905 --> 00:20:43,806
THERE, DOUG?

729
00:20:43,806 --> 00:20:44,640
YOU'RE UP THERE.

730
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,441
[laughs]

731
00:20:45,441 --> 00:20:46,375
>> NO, I DON'T.

732
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,910
WHY WOULD YOU ASK THAT?

733
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:48,644
>> I DON'T KNOW.

734
00:20:48,644 --> 00:20:49,512
>> WELL, LOOK, DO YOU WANT

735
00:20:49,512 --> 00:20:50,613
TO PASS ME THAT OIL CAN?

736
00:20:50,613 --> 00:20:51,514
I'M LOOKING HERE, AND I THINK

737
00:20:51,514 --> 00:20:52,315
SHE'S DOWN A BIT.

738
00:20:52,315 --> 00:20:53,049
SHE'S GOT A BIT OF A THIRST

739
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:53,783
ON HER.

740
00:20:53,783 --> 00:20:54,550
>> ALL RIGHT.

741
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,485
YOU GONNA TOP HER UP, HUH?

742
00:20:55,485 --> 00:20:56,652
>> YEAH, SURE, YOU KNOW.

743
00:20:56,652 --> 00:20:57,987
TO STAY ON TOP OF THIS,

744
00:20:57,987 --> 00:21:00,156
IT'S A FULL-TIME JOB.

745
00:21:00,156 --> 00:21:02,825
KEEP HER IN A-1 CONDITION.

746
00:21:02,825 --> 00:21:05,361
IT'S LIKE THEM FELLERS YOU SEE

747
00:21:05,361 --> 00:21:06,262
THAT--THAT PAINT THAT

748
00:21:06,262 --> 00:21:07,363
GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE, YOU KNOW.

749
00:21:07,363 --> 00:21:08,264
THEY'RE NO SOONER DONE

750
00:21:08,264 --> 00:21:09,232
PAINTING HER

751
00:21:09,232 --> 00:21:10,132
THEN THEY GOT TO START

752
00:21:10,132 --> 00:21:11,534
ALL OVER AGAIN, YOU KNOW?

753
00:21:11,534 --> 00:21:12,869
BUT OH!

754
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:14,103
THAT LAST BIG EARTHQUAKE,

755
00:21:14,103 --> 00:21:15,171
SHE'S STILL STANDING,

756
00:21:15,171 --> 00:21:16,372
SO IF YOU UNDERSTAND

757
00:21:16,372 --> 00:21:17,306
WHAT I'M SAYING...

758
00:21:17,306 --> 00:21:18,040
>> YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

759
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,075
>> GOOD.

760
00:21:19,075 --> 00:21:20,676
>> OKAY.

761
00:21:20,676 --> 00:21:21,611
>> OKAY, WE'RE JUST GONNA

762
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:22,411
TOP HER OFF.

763
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:23,179
>> ALL RIGHTY.

764
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:24,947
FILL HER UP THERE.

765
00:21:24,947 --> 00:21:25,681
>> YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL,

766
00:21:25,681 --> 00:21:26,582
YOU KNOW.

767
00:21:26,582 --> 00:21:28,217
YOU GET OIL ON HERE, AND BEFORE

768
00:21:28,217 --> 00:21:29,886
YOU KNOW IT, YOU GOT A FIRE,

769
00:21:29,886 --> 00:21:31,354
WHICH IS WHAT WE GOT IN

770
00:21:31,354 --> 00:21:32,555
CASTORVILLE THERE THAT ONE TIME.

771
00:21:32,555 --> 00:21:34,223
>> YEAH, I--I READ ABOUT THAT.

772
00:21:34,223 --> 00:21:35,191
WELL, DOUG,

773
00:21:35,191 --> 00:21:35,925
HEY, BEST OF LUCK TO YOU.

774
00:21:35,925 --> 00:21:36,959
AND, GOSH, SHE'S LOOKING GREAT

775
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:37,760
HERE.

776
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,928
>> YEP, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

777
00:21:38,928 --> 00:21:39,829
SHE IS LOOKING GOOD.

778
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:40,563
>> LOOKING REAL GOOD.

779
00:21:40,563 --> 00:21:41,297
LOOKING REAL GOOD.

780
00:21:41,297 --> 00:21:42,064
ALL RIGHT.

781
00:21:42,064 --> 00:21:43,466
THAT'S DOUGIE FRANKLIN THERE

782
00:21:43,466 --> 00:21:44,900
AND HIS BIG, BIG, BIG, BIG, BIG,

783
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,068
BIG, BIG, BIG, BIG TRUCK.

784
00:21:46,068 --> 00:21:48,304
YOU GOT A NAME FOR HER, DOUGIE?

785
00:21:48,304 --> 00:21:50,406
>> YEAH, WE CALL HER IMELDA.

786
00:21:50,406 --> 00:21:51,340
>> IMELDA?

787
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,875
GOD, THAT'S PERFECT, ISN'T IT?

788
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,477
ALL RIGHT, HAROLD.

789
00:21:54,477 --> 00:21:57,046
MAKE ME SICK.

790
00:22:02,118 --> 00:22:03,719
POOR OLD STINKY WAS OUT THERE

791
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:05,021
DIGGING THE WELL, JUST DIGGING

792
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:05,921
AND DIGGING AND DIGGING

793
00:22:05,921 --> 00:22:06,689
A LONG TIME.

794
00:22:06,689 --> 00:22:07,923
I MEAN, HE CUT THROUGH

795
00:22:07,923 --> 00:22:09,158
HYDRO LINES,

796
00:22:09,158 --> 00:22:10,326
HE CUT THROUGH GAS LINES,

797
00:22:10,326 --> 00:22:11,360
AND THEN HE COME UP WITH A ROCK

798
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,561
THERE THAT WAS ABOUT THE SIZE

799
00:22:12,561 --> 00:22:13,896
OF MOOSE THOMPSON'S HEAD

800
00:22:13,896 --> 00:22:15,765
AND ABOUT THE SAME WEIGHT

801
00:22:15,765 --> 00:22:18,367
AND VERY SIMILAR IN COMPLEXION.

802
00:22:18,367 --> 00:22:20,236
THEN AFTER ABOUT 12 HOURS,

803
00:22:20,236 --> 00:22:21,470
HE SAYS HE THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA

804
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,805
STRIKE WATER AT ANY MOMENT,

805
00:22:22,805 --> 00:22:23,939
WHICH IS A REAL DUMB THING

806
00:22:23,939 --> 00:22:24,974
TO SAY AROUND MEN WHO'VE BEEN

807
00:22:24,974 --> 00:22:26,842
DRINKING BEER ALL DAY.

808
00:22:26,842 --> 00:22:29,712
LUCKILY, THEIR AIM WAS OFF.

809
00:22:29,712 --> 00:22:31,847
BUT AROUND 3:00 IN THE MORNING,

810
00:22:31,847 --> 00:22:33,249
I GUESS IT WAS, STINKY FINALLY

811
00:22:33,249 --> 00:22:34,650
HIT WATER, BUT WHEN WE SHONE

812
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,885
THE FLASHLIGHT DOWN,

813
00:22:35,885 --> 00:22:36,919
WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS,

814
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:38,087
HE'D GONE SO FAR OFF COURSE

815
00:22:38,087 --> 00:22:39,021
THAT HE HAD GONE

816
00:22:39,021 --> 00:22:40,990
INTO THE OLD WELL SHAFT.

817
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,391
SO WE JUST THREW DOWN

818
00:22:42,391 --> 00:22:44,026
A REPLACEMENT WASHER,

819
00:22:44,026 --> 00:22:45,795
AND HE FIXED THE FOOT VALVE.

820
00:22:45,795 --> 00:22:47,663
EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT, SO IT

821
00:22:47,663 --> 00:22:49,031
WORKED OUT GREAT, BUT--STINKY

822
00:22:49,031 --> 00:22:50,099
WASN'T ALL THAT PLEASED,

823
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:50,866
BUT, YOU KNOW, HE HAS

824
00:22:50,866 --> 00:22:52,401
THAT LOGIC PROBLEM THING.

825
00:22:52,401 --> 00:22:54,270
ANYWAY, IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

826
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,738
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME,

827
00:22:55,738 --> 00:22:57,306
BUT THE BRIDGE IS OUT

828
00:22:57,306 --> 00:22:58,874
ON THE NUMBER TWO SIDE ROAD,

829
00:22:58,874 --> 00:22:59,675
SO I MAY BE A LITTLE BIT

830
00:22:59,675 --> 00:23:00,776
LATER, 'CAUSE I HAVE TO TAKE

831
00:23:00,776 --> 00:23:01,911
THE EXPRESSWAY.

832
00:23:01,911 --> 00:23:03,012
ANYWAY,

833
00:23:03,012 --> 00:23:04,146
THANKS AGAIN FOR WATCHING,

834
00:23:04,146 --> 00:23:05,080
AND ON BEHALF OF MYSELF

835
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,583
AND HAROLD AND THE WHOLE GANG

836
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:08,651
UP HERE AT THE LODGE,

837
00:23:08,651 --> 00:23:09,785
UNTIL NEXT TIME,

838
00:23:09,785 --> 00:23:12,555
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.
