1
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,270
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

2
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:07,107
HERE'S THE MAN WHO MAKES IT
LOOK SO EASY,

3
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:08,742
SO CHEAP AND SO TAWDRY,

4
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:12,712
YOUR HERO, MY UNCLE, RED GREEN!

5
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:16,282
(Applause and cheering)

6
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,118
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

7
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:20,386
OK.

8
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:21,921
OH BOY.

9
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,490
A LOT OF EXCITEMENT

10
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:25,625
UP AT THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

11
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,127
THE BUNCH OF US

12
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,195
ARE GOING TO CHARTER A BUS

13
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:31,064
COME HELL OR HIGH WATER,

14
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,333
WE'RE GOING TO THE BIG SMOKE,

15
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:35,635
GONNA WATCH A BLUE JAYS GAME.

16
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,637
WHOO! EXCELLENT! EXCELLENT!

17
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,139
WOW!

18
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:42,008
HOW COME NO ONE TOLD ME
ABOUT THIS TRIP?

19
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:47,814
YOU HAVE TO ASK?

20
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,984
YOU HAVE TO ANSWER?

21
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,989
(Horns honking)

22
00:00:56,055 --> 00:01:00,827
(Geese honking)

23
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,162
(Quacking)

24
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:07,000
(Red): YOU'RE LOOKIN'
AT SEGMENTS

25
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:09,335
FROM THIS PARTICULAR SHOW,

26
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,503
THE MESSAGE BEING,

27
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,938
DON'T THINK ABOUT

28
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,339
CHANGING THE CHANNEL.

29
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,842
AND MAKE SENSE OUT OF

30
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,543
THIS PROGRAMME, GIVE IT

31
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,213
YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.

32
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,087
GOOD NEWS, EVERYBODY.

33
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:30,089
I'VE ARRANGED
FOR TRANSPORTATION

34
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:32,025
FOR THE LODGE MEMBERS.

35
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,826
YOU CHARTERED A BUS TO TORONTO?

36
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:35,828
NO, I BOUGHT ON.

37
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,363
I WENT TO SEE THE GUY.

38
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,134
HE WANTED 100 BUCKS TO DRIVE US
IN THIS WRECK OF A SCHOOL BUS.

39
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,037
HIS WIFE SAID "GIMME $200,
TAKE THE THING HOME."

40
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:45,938
WE GOT THE GUYS
WORKING ON IT.

41
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:49,208
IT SHOULD TAKE TWO HOURS
TO MAKE IT ROADWORTHY,

42
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,744
FOUR IF WE WANT LIGHTS,
SIX FOR BRAKES.

43
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,246
BUT UNCLE RED,

44
00:01:53,312 --> 00:01:54,781
THINK ABOUT IT.

45
00:01:54,847 --> 00:01:56,616
HUH?

46
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,519
AT THAT RATE
WE'LL LATE FOR THE GAME.

47
00:01:59,585 --> 00:02:01,421
WE'RE NOT GOING TO THE GAME.

48
00:02:01,487 --> 00:02:03,523
WE JUST TOLD THAT
TO THE WIVES.

49
00:02:03,589 --> 00:02:05,024
(Chuckling)

50
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,893
YOU SAID THERE'S A GAME.

51
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,128
YOU SAID HELL OR HIGH WATER.

52
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:13,132
NOBODY SAID ANYTHING ABOUT
CASINO NIGHT AT THE CHURCH.

53
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,468
GAMBLING,
YOU'RE GOING GAMBLING!

54
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,470
YOU LIED TO YOUR WIVES!

55
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,472
NO, WE DIDN'T.

56
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:22,375
WE JUST DIDN'T BURDEN THEM
WITH THE DETAILS.

57
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,544
ANYWAY, OUR WIVES WILL BE HAPPY.

58
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,579
THEY WANT US TO HAVE SOME FUN.

59
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:30,416
I THINK THEY'LL BE PLEASED
TO KNOW WE'RE GOING TO CHURCH.

60
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,152
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL THEM?

61
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,921
YOU GUYS ARE DISGUSTING.

62
00:02:34,987 --> 00:02:37,890
MEN WHO LIE TO WOMEN
SHOULDN'T HAVE WIVES.

63
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:41,861
MEN WHO DON'T LIE TO WOMEN
CAN'T GET WIVES.

64
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:43,963
COMING UP A LITTLE LATER,

65
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,899
HAROLD AND BILL ARE GOING TO
DO SOME CANOEING.

66
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,935
THAT'S HAROLD UNDER THE CANOE.

67
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:50,603
HE NEVER LOOKED BETTER.

68
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,438
IT'S SO-- OH!

69
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,006
SO BEAUTIFUL AND...

70
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,243
SERENE OUT THERE.

71
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,811
AH!

72
00:02:58,878 --> 00:02:59,979
OH!

73
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:02,181
HOW CALM THE WATER IS.

74
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:08,187
JUST TO BE AT ONE WITH NATURE,
I THINK, IT'S GOOD FOR PEOPLE.

75
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,122
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

76
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:13,793
OH, BACK IN THE DAYS
OF KING ARTHUR

77
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:15,995
WHEN CHIVALRY WAS HOT

78
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,230
GUINEVERE LIKED ARTHUR
A LITTLE

79
00:03:18,297 --> 00:03:20,633
BUT SHE REALLY LIKED
LANCELOT

80
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,802
"EVERY DOG
WILL HAVE HIS DAY"

81
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:24,904
ARTHUR TOLD HER
DURING A FIGHT

82
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:27,239
SHE SAID "DOGS CAN HAVE
ALL THE DAYS THEY WANT

83
00:03:27,306 --> 00:03:29,875
"AS LONG AS I GET
MY KNIGHT"

84
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,080
(Laughing)

85
00:03:34,146 --> 00:03:37,183
WELCOME TO THE POSSUM LODGE
WORD GAME!

86
00:03:37,249 --> 00:03:38,851
TONIGHT WE'RE PLAYING FOR

87
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:41,253
SEASONS TICKETS
TO THE WINNIPEG JETS.

88
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,024
DALTON, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO GET MY UNCLE TO SAY

89
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:46,926
THIS WORD...

90
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:48,494
TOOL.

91
00:03:49,995 --> 00:03:51,430
TOOL.

92
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:52,932
AND GO.

93
00:03:52,998 --> 00:03:55,234
A WORKMAN
IS ONLY AS GOOD AS HIS...

94
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,869
UNION.

95
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:58,370
NO, OK.

96
00:03:58,437 --> 00:04:00,005
YOU ALWAYS WANT TO USE

97
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:02,341
THE RIGHT SOMETHING
FOR THE JOB.

98
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,943
THE RIGHT HAND.

99
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:06,212
UH, THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE LAW.

100
00:04:06,278 --> 00:04:07,713
THE RIGHT SCREWDRIVER.

101
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,215
NO, OK.

102
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:10,950
YOUR SCREWDRIVERS
AND SAWS

103
00:04:11,016 --> 00:04:12,952
AND YOUR HAMMERS ARE ALL...

104
00:04:13,018 --> 00:04:14,487
RUSTED.

105
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:16,455
YEAH, THEY ARE.

106
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,190
THEY'RE BROKEN.

107
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:19,692
THEY'RE STOLEN... SMUGGLED.

108
00:04:19,758 --> 00:04:21,794
OK, LOOK, AT MY STORE,
THERE'S SCREWDRIVERS.

109
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,762
I GOT HAMMERS AND SAWS

110
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:25,264
AND A COMPLETE LINE OF...

111
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,900
CRAP --
IT IS.

112
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,401
BERNICE,

113
00:04:29,468 --> 00:04:31,337
SHE WANTS YOU TO DO A JOB
AROUND THE HOUSE.

114
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:34,907
YOU MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT
A GOOD ASSORTMENT OF...

115
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,475
EXCUSES.

116
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,043
NO -- NOW LISTEN TO ME.

117
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,179
WHEN YOU'VE RUN OUT OF EXCUSES,

118
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:42,281
YOU IMMEDIATELY GRAB
FOR YOUR...

119
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:43,782
COAT.

120
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:46,185
LAXATIVES.

121
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:48,320
A SMART WORKMAN
ALWAYS BLAMES HIS...

122
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:50,122
NEPHEW!

123
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,690
HEY!

124
00:04:53,492 --> 00:04:57,596
LOOK... THE REASON

125
00:04:57,663 --> 00:05:01,200
YOU NEVER LET HAROLD
HELP YOU IN THE WORKSHOP

126
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:05,104
IS BECAUSE HE IS A...

127
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,473
I'M IN THE ROOM!

128
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:09,174
I KNOW,
I KNOW.

129
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:13,512
CLOSE ENOUGH.

130
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:19,952
THIS WEEK ON "HANDYMAN CORNER"
I WANNA TALK ABOUT TOOLS,

131
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,454
OR, MORE SPECIFICALLY,
TOOL-BOXES.

132
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:25,424
AS SOON AS YOU GET
A COMPLETE SET OF TOOLS,

133
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,926
NEXT THING YOU KNOW
YOU GOT FRIENDS,

134
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:31,430
NEIGHBOURS, GUYS YOU WORK WITH,
AND FAMILY MEMBERS

135
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,767
BORROWING TOOLS
AND NOT BRINGING THEM BACK.

136
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,970
SO YOU'RE LEFT HOLDING
THE EMPTY TOOL-BOX.

137
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:40,639
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH
AN EMPTY TOOL-BOX?

138
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:42,908
HOW ABOUT YOU BUILD
A SLOW COOKER?

139
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:46,211
IT'S A NO-BRAINER,
WHICH IS SORT OF MY SPECIALTY.

140
00:05:46,278 --> 00:05:47,880
FIRST THING YOU WANNA DO

141
00:05:47,946 --> 00:05:50,082
AFTER YOU EMPTY
THE COMPARTMENTS,

142
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:53,085
SPRAY THAT NON-STICK
COOKING STUFF IN THERE.

143
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:54,853
JUST SOCK THAT IN THERE.

144
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,223
YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE
BAKED ON PORK AND BEANS

145
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,759
RUINING THE FINISH
ON YOUR TOOL-BOX.

146
00:06:00,826 --> 00:06:03,328
JUST A MINUTE,
JUST A MINUTE.

147
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,433
THERE WE GO.

148
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,769
THIS IS
THE NON-STICK COOKING SPRAY.

149
00:06:10,836 --> 00:06:12,738
THAT WAS BROWN PRIMER.

150
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,907
PEOPLE WILL THINK
IT'S BARBECUE SAUCE.

151
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,411
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS

152
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:22,681
PUT THE VEGETABLES INTO
THE VARIOUS DRAWERS THERE.

153
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:24,950
I'M GOING WITH
THE FROZEN MATERIAL.

154
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,785
I FIND IT EASIER TO HANDLE.

155
00:06:26,852 --> 00:06:28,287
PUT THE PEAS IN THERE.

156
00:06:28,353 --> 00:06:29,788
AND THEN THE CORN.

157
00:06:29,855 --> 00:06:31,456
OW!

158
00:06:31,523 --> 00:06:32,958
OH.

159
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,760
PUT SOME ICE ON THAT.

160
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:37,296
I'LL USE THE BRUSSELS SPROUTS.

161
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:40,465
IT'S THE ONLY THING
THEY'RE GOOD FOR.

162
00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:44,903
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL JUST STICK
THE CHICKEN IN THE TOP.

163
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,639
THAT'S GOING TO BE
A LITTLE TOO BIG.

164
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:49,474
I'M GONNA CUT THAT UP.

165
00:06:54,146 --> 00:06:55,581
THERE WE GO.

166
00:06:55,647 --> 00:06:59,084
A COATING OF OIL
KEEPS YOUR TOOLS FROM RUSTING.

167
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:02,788
ADD THE POTATOES IN THERE
AROUND THE CHICKEN.

168
00:07:02,854 --> 00:07:06,425
THE FRENCH CALL THESE
"APPLES OF THE EARTH".

169
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:09,094
I GUESS YOU COULD MAKE
VODKA APPLE SAUCE.

170
00:07:09,161 --> 00:07:10,629
BUT THAT'S ANOTHER DAY.

171
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:13,965
AND PROBABLY A NIGHT
AND RIGHT THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

172
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:16,068
GET THOSE IN THERE --
THEN ADD A CAN OF

173
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:17,769
YOUR FAVOURITE GRAVY.

174
00:07:17,836 --> 00:07:19,237
BUT DON'T OPEN IT.

175
00:07:19,304 --> 00:07:21,773
JUST LIE IT IN THERE
ON ITS SIDE,

176
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,675
AND CLOSE EVERYTHING UP.

177
00:07:23,742 --> 00:07:25,644
YOU WANNA SEAL IN
YOUR JUICES AND FLAVOURING.

178
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,180
FOR THAT JOB,
I RECOMMEND YOU USE

179
00:07:28,246 --> 00:07:31,850
THE GOURMET CHEF'S
SECRET WEAPON... DUCT TAPE.

180
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,292
NOW, ORDINARILY, I WOULD DO
THIS BARBECUING OUTSIDE.

181
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:41,460
IT'S HOT OUT THERE.

182
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:42,894
I HATE SUMMER.

183
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:45,897
THE BEAUTY OF USING A TOOL-BOX
IS YOU CAN HAVE

184
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:48,433
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
FOR A SMALL EVENT,

185
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,702
OR YOU CAN GET
ONE OF THESE UNITS

186
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:52,337
AND HAVE THE GANG OVER.

187
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:56,408
BUT DO NOT USE THE LIGHTWEIGHT
PLASTIC TOOL-BOX TO COOK IN.

188
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:59,911
OTHERWISE YOU END UP WITH
SOMETHING ALONG THIS LINE.

189
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:03,648
I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH BOOZE
YOU SLAKE INTO YOUR GUESTS.

190
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:06,418
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO
TAKE A BITE OF THAT.

191
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:09,421
IF YOU DO WANT TO USE
THE PLASTIC TOOL-BOX,

192
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:13,258
I'D SUGGEST THAT YOU GO
WITH THE HORS-D'OEUVRE TRAY.

193
00:08:13,325 --> 00:08:17,028
YOU GOT CARROT STICKS,
CELERY, BREADSTICKS, AND SO ON.

194
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:20,532
YOU GOT A DRAWER
WHERE YOU CAN KEEP DIP,

195
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:22,534
OR AS WE CALL THEM, "HAROLD".

196
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:24,636
IT'S NOT THAT YOU'LL EAT THIS.

197
00:08:24,703 --> 00:08:26,338
IT KEEPS THE LADIES BUSY

198
00:08:26,404 --> 00:08:28,874
WHILE YOU GUYS
EMPTY THE BEER COOLER.

199
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,443
THE BEAUTY IS
YOU'VE GOT YOUR DINNER...

200
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:32,944
SIMMERING AWAY THERE.

201
00:08:33,011 --> 00:08:35,547
IT GIVES YOU TIME
TO DO SOMETHING ELSE.

202
00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:37,349
YOU COULD BUILD SOMETHING.

203
00:08:37,415 --> 00:08:40,352
YOU COULD COME UP WITH A CURE
FOR A DISEASE.

204
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:44,055
I PREFER TO SIT
AND NOT THINK ABOUT ANYTHING.

205
00:08:44,122 --> 00:08:45,957
I'M GETTING GOOD AT IT.

206
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:48,960
(Sizzling)

207
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:56,968
(Snoring)

208
00:08:57,035 --> 00:09:01,573
MY INSTINCTS ARE TELLING ME
THIS IS READY TO GO ANY MOMENT.

209
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,074
THERE WE GO.

210
00:09:03,141 --> 00:09:05,744
THAT'S THE GRAVY
RIGHT ON TIME.

211
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,812
I'M HUNGRY.

212
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:11,149
LOOKS LIKE THIS LEG
IS THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB.

213
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:14,019
REMEMBER, IF WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

214
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:16,421
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

215
00:09:16,488 --> 00:09:18,390
(Crunching)

216
00:09:18,456 --> 00:09:19,891
A LITTLE CHEWY.

217
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,659
WAIT, WAIT.

218
00:09:21,726 --> 00:09:23,828
JUST A HOSE WASHER.

219
00:09:25,497 --> 00:09:29,501
STAY TUNED -- WHATEVER THIS IS,
WE GOT A LOT MORE OF IT.

220
00:09:33,638 --> 00:09:34,906
I WANNA TALK TO GUYS

221
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:37,675
WHO'VE GOTTEN MARRIED
FOR THE SECOND TIME.

222
00:09:37,742 --> 00:09:40,979
CHANCES ARE YOU'RE A STEPDAD
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

223
00:09:41,045 --> 00:09:42,747
OK, REMEMBER THIS.

224
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:44,249
STEPDADS SCARE KIDS.

225
00:09:44,315 --> 00:09:47,152
FIRST OF ALL,
THEY THINK YOU'RE WEIRD

226
00:09:47,218 --> 00:09:50,088
BECAUSE YOU FIND
THEIR MOTHER PRETTY.

227
00:09:50,155 --> 00:09:53,658
IT'S GONNA TAKE THEM A WHILE
TO GET OVER THAT ONE.

228
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:55,860
PLUS YOU'RE HARD TO
GET USED TO,

229
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:58,096
THE WAY YOU LOOK
IN THE MORNING,

230
00:09:58,163 --> 00:10:01,432
AND THE WAY YOU LAUGH
AT "DUKES OF HAZZARD".

231
00:10:01,499 --> 00:10:03,101
SO REVEAL YOURSELF SLOWLY,

232
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:06,871
THE SAME WAY YOU'RE PLANNING
TO DO WITH YOUR NEW WIFE.

233
00:10:06,938 --> 00:10:08,673
SPEND TIME WITH THE KIDS.

234
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,308
I KNOW IT'S A NUISANCE.

235
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:13,678
IF YOU SPEND TIME WITH THEM
WHILE THEY'RE YOUNG,

236
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:17,248
IT WILL SAVE YOU SPENDING TIME
DRIVING THEIR MOTHER

237
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:19,617
TO PENITENTIARIES
ON VISITING DAY.

238
00:10:19,684 --> 00:10:21,119
IT'S A LOT OF WORK.

239
00:10:21,185 --> 00:10:25,056
MAKES YOU WISH YOU'D TRIED
HARDER ON YOUR FIRST MARRIAGE.

240
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:26,558
HERE'S THE UPSIDE.

241
00:10:26,624 --> 00:10:29,827
IF THESE KIDS DON'T TURN OUT,
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

242
00:10:29,894 --> 00:10:32,096
THEY'RE NOT PART OF
YOUR GENE POOL.

243
00:10:32,163 --> 00:10:34,232
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YA.

244
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:36,234
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

245
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:38,970
(Applause)

246
00:10:40,638 --> 00:10:43,641
(Audience laughing)

247
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:02,994
WELL, I'LL TELL YA,

248
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:06,164
THE CHURCH CASINO NIGHT
WAS A HUGE SUCCESS.

249
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,133
MIGHT HAVE DROPPED
A COUPLE OF NICKELS, HAROLD.

250
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,468
OH, DIDN'T NOTICE.

251
00:11:10,535 --> 00:11:13,271
THERE'S LOTS MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

252
00:11:13,337 --> 00:11:14,706
BOY, I HAVEN'T SEEN

253
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:16,074
THIS MANY NICKELS

254
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,110
SINCE WE INSTALLED A PAY TOILET
ON MEXICAN NIGHT.

255
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:20,611
(Audience laughing)

256
00:11:20,678 --> 00:11:22,346
BY GOLLY, WE WERE ROLLIN'.

257
00:11:22,413 --> 00:11:24,882
WE BROKE THE HOUSE,
WE BROKE THE CHURCH.

258
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:26,417
THEY MAY HAVE TO CLOSE.

259
00:11:26,484 --> 00:11:29,387
OUR LADY OF LUCK
IS A DUMB NAME FOR A CHURCH.

260
00:11:29,454 --> 00:11:31,055
I THINK THIS IS TERRIBLE.

261
00:11:31,122 --> 00:11:33,024
WE BANKRUPTED A HOUSE OF GOD.

262
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:34,725
WE'RE GONNA GET PUNISHED.

263
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:38,696
WE'LL GET PUT SOMEWHERE EVIL,
DARK, SCARY, SMELLY, AND WET!

264
00:11:38,763 --> 00:11:41,566
WE'RE HERE.

265
00:11:41,632 --> 00:11:43,568
YEAH.

266
00:11:43,634 --> 00:11:45,069
ACTUALLY, IT'S TOO BAD.

267
00:11:45,136 --> 00:11:48,873
THEY WERE RUNNIN' THE CASINO
TO RAISE MONEY FOR A NEW ORGAN.

268
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,741
WE BANKRUPTED THE ORGAN FUND,

269
00:11:50,808 --> 00:11:53,077
THE ORPHAN FUND,
AND THE WINE BUDGET.

270
00:11:53,144 --> 00:11:56,080
LUCKILY, THE VATICAN KICKED IN
SOME EXTRA CASH.

271
00:11:56,147 --> 00:11:58,182
$20,000 -- THAT'S
A LOT OF MONEY...

272
00:11:58,249 --> 00:12:00,117
ESPECIALLY WHEN
IT'S IN NICKELS.

273
00:12:00,184 --> 00:12:01,552
THEY MADE THEIR MISTAKE

274
00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:04,989
BY LETTING THE MOTHER SUPERIOR
PROGRAM THE SLOT MACHINE.

275
00:12:05,056 --> 00:12:06,490
IT JUST KEPT PAYING OFF.

276
00:12:06,557 --> 00:12:08,559
IT'S STILL WRONG, THOUGH.

277
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:10,728
WE GOTTA RETURN THE MONEY.

278
00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:12,730
WE WON IT FAIR AND SQUARE.

279
00:12:12,797 --> 00:12:15,499
THE TOUGH PART'S
CONVINCING OUR WIVES

280
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:20,104
WE FOUND 400,000 NICKELS
IN THE SEATS OF THE OLD BUS.

281
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:22,173
(Audience laughing)

282
00:12:25,776 --> 00:12:32,550
(Siren)

283
00:12:32,617 --> 00:12:36,053
POSSUM 911 -- STATE YOUR
MEMBERSHIP NUMBER, PLEASE.

284
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,823
876,900.

285
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:40,558
TEDDY, WHAT'S THE EMERGENCY?

286
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,393
IT'S NOT REALLY AN EMERGENCY.

287
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,229
I WANTED TO SHARE SOMETHING
WITH YOUR VIEWERS.

288
00:12:45,296 --> 00:12:47,064
COOL -- INFORMATION
EXCHANGE!

289
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:48,399
GREAT! GO AHEAD!

290
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:51,202
OK, SO I'M UNEMPLOYED,
BUT THE WIFE WORKS.

291
00:12:51,268 --> 00:12:54,572
SO I STAY AT HOME AND DO
THE COOKING AND CLEANING.

292
00:12:54,638 --> 00:12:56,407
WOW! WHAT'S
THAT LIKE?

293
00:12:56,474 --> 00:12:57,742
IT SUCKS.

294
00:12:57,808 --> 00:12:59,176
(Audience laughing)

295
00:12:59,243 --> 00:13:02,847
ALL I DO IS FEED PEOPLE
AND CLEAN UP AFTER 'EM.

296
00:13:02,913 --> 00:13:04,548
I'M EVERYBODY'S MAID.

297
00:13:04,615 --> 00:13:09,086
HOW HARD CAN IT BE TO THROW
DIRTY LAUNDRY IN THE HAMPER?

298
00:13:09,153 --> 00:13:11,122
YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE WORST?

299
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:15,092
WET TOWELS ON THE BATHROOM
FLOOR, WITH HAIR ON 'EM!

300
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:17,094
YEAH, YOU SHOULD
SEE THE TOWELS

301
00:13:17,161 --> 00:13:19,130
AROUND HERE --
THEY'RE COVERED.

302
00:13:19,196 --> 00:13:21,232
THAT'S NOT HAIR.

303
00:13:21,298 --> 00:13:23,934
ALL DAY LONG,
IT'S "DAD, WHERE ARE MY SOCKS?

304
00:13:24,001 --> 00:13:25,503
"DAD, WHAT'S FOR DINNER?

305
00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:27,838
"DAD, WILL YOU DRIVE ME
TO THE MALL?

306
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:30,841
"DAD, YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO WASH MY GYM SHORTS."

307
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:33,177
DOESN'T YOUR WIFE HELP
AT ALL, TEDDY?

308
00:13:33,244 --> 00:13:35,379
SHE SAYS SHE'S TOO TIRED
FROM WORK.

309
00:13:35,446 --> 00:13:38,282
LITTLE MISS IMPORTANT
WANTS TO READ HER PAPER.

310
00:13:38,349 --> 00:13:41,418
THEN SHE ORDERS ME
TO GET SOME FOOD ON THE TABLE.

311
00:13:41,485 --> 00:13:43,053
I DON'T WANT TO BE A NAG.

312
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,421
IT'S SO BORING.

313
00:13:44,488 --> 00:13:48,459
SAME ROUTINE, DAY AFTER DAY,
SO I'VE COME UP

314
00:13:48,526 --> 00:13:51,428
WITH A SOLUTION
THAT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND

315
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:53,731
TO OTHER GUYS IN MY SITUATION.

316
00:13:53,797 --> 00:13:55,065
WE'RE LISTENING.

317
00:13:55,132 --> 00:13:56,367
WELL, I'VE JUST KINDA

318
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:59,270
GONE ON STRIKE
IN THE ROMANCE DEPARTMENT,

319
00:13:59,336 --> 00:14:01,071
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

320
00:14:01,138 --> 00:14:02,540
OHHHH!

321
00:14:02,606 --> 00:14:05,876
IF I DON'T GET TREATED
WITH RESPECT IN THE KITCHEN,

322
00:14:05,943 --> 00:14:09,547
THEN NOBODY GETS TREATED
WITH ANYTHING IN THE BEDROOM,

323
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:11,081
IF YOU CATCH MY DRIFT.

324
00:14:11,148 --> 00:14:12,616
HOW'S THAT
WORKING?

325
00:14:12,683 --> 00:14:16,420
EXCELLENT! SHE'S PUTTING IN
LATE NIGHTS AT THE OFFICE,

326
00:14:16,487 --> 00:14:18,889
GOING TO MORE
BUSINESS CONVENTIONS.

327
00:14:18,956 --> 00:14:23,627
SHE'S TRYING TO EARN MORE MONEY
SO SHE CAN HIRE A MAID.

328
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:27,164
THAT'S WHAT
SHE'S DOING.
RIGHT!

329
00:14:27,231 --> 00:14:28,666
YES, EXACTLY,
YEAH.

330
00:14:28,732 --> 00:14:32,169
(Red): HERE WE ARE,
"ADVENTURES WITH BILL".

331
00:14:32,236 --> 00:14:35,039
THEY GOT THE CANOE
STRAIGHTENED OUT.

332
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:38,575
HAROLD GOT HIS OWN FORM
OF A LIFE-JACKET ON.

333
00:14:38,642 --> 00:14:40,110
SCARY, ISN'T IT?

334
00:14:40,177 --> 00:14:43,547
YOU MAY NOT HAVE THAT CANOE
FAR ENOUGH INTO THE WATER.

335
00:14:43,614 --> 00:14:45,049
THIS IS GOOD, THOUGH.

336
00:14:45,115 --> 00:14:48,218
THIS IS THE PART
OF THE CANOEING EXPERIENCE--

337
00:14:48,285 --> 00:14:50,054
YOU LEARN ABOUT TEAMWORK.

338
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,556
GET THAT FARTHER IN THE WATER.

339
00:14:52,623 --> 00:14:53,857
THAT SHOULD DO IT.

340
00:14:53,924 --> 00:14:55,526
OK, YOU MAY HAVE GONE--

341
00:14:55,592 --> 00:14:57,561
YEAH, WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.

342
00:14:57,628 --> 00:15:00,431
YOU MAY HAVE GONE
A LITTLE OVERBOARD ON--

343
00:15:00,497 --> 00:15:02,566
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

344
00:15:02,633 --> 00:15:04,568
YEAH, YEAH.

345
00:15:04,635 --> 00:15:06,070
REALLY, WHAT'S THE PLAN?

346
00:15:06,136 --> 00:15:07,871
WE DON'T WANT TO WATCH THIS.

347
00:15:07,938 --> 00:15:10,307
GET THE CANOE
WHILE WE'RE NOT WATCHING.

348
00:15:10,374 --> 00:15:11,675
HERE WE GO.

349
00:15:11,742 --> 00:15:13,911
SO THEY'RE OUT THERE CANOEING,

350
00:15:13,977 --> 00:15:16,580
AND HAROLD HASN'T TOTALLY
MASTERED--

351
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:18,715
OK, ALL RIGHT, SETTLE DOWN!

352
00:15:18,782 --> 00:15:20,417
SETTLE DOWN, SETTLE DOWN!

353
00:15:20,484 --> 00:15:21,819
BOY, OH, BOY!

354
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:25,022
IF THERE WAS ONE MORE,
WE'D HAVE THE CHIPMUNKS.

355
00:15:25,088 --> 00:15:26,523
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

356
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,192
THEY'RE GONNA SWITCH ENDS

357
00:15:28,258 --> 00:15:30,527
IN THE CANOE,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

358
00:15:30,594 --> 00:15:32,529
YOU MIGHT ENJOY THIS.

359
00:15:32,596 --> 00:15:34,031
WHOA!

360
00:15:34,097 --> 00:15:35,532
HMMM...

361
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:38,535
I WONDER WHAT'S GONNA
HAPPEN HERE.

362
00:15:38,602 --> 00:15:42,539
I'M SENSING A SPLASH
SOMEWHERE IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

363
00:15:42,606 --> 00:15:44,208
YOU GOT A PLAN, BOYS?

364
00:15:44,274 --> 00:15:47,444
THAT'S IT -- RAISE
THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY.

365
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:49,546
THAT'S ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA.

366
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:51,715
WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?

367
00:15:51,782 --> 00:15:55,552
OH, BY GOLLY,
THE MIRACLE OF CHILDBIRTH!

368
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:58,555
WE DO EVERYTHING ON THIS SHOW.

369
00:15:58,622 --> 00:15:59,890
WELL, BY GOLLY!

370
00:15:59,957 --> 00:16:03,393
I JUST LOST 10 BUCKS
ON A BET RIGHT THERE.

371
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,562
THAT WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE.

372
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:06,930
NICE WORK, GUYS.

373
00:16:06,997 --> 00:16:08,966
YOU DIDN'T GET ANYWHERE,

374
00:16:09,032 --> 00:16:12,069
BUT YOU DIDN'T GO DOWN
WITH THE SHIP.

375
00:16:12,135 --> 00:16:14,504
NOW BILL WANTS HAROLD
TO TURN AROUND.

376
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:18,542
HAROLD, YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
BACKING INTO STUFF, BELIEVE ME,

377
00:16:18,609 --> 00:16:20,344
NOT WITH YOUR PERSONALITY.

378
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,479
WHEN THEY ACTUALLY GET GOING...

379
00:16:22,546 --> 00:16:25,782
FUNNY HOW YOU COULD HAVE
TWO GUYS WEARING GLASSES

380
00:16:25,849 --> 00:16:28,652
WHO STILL DON'T SEE
A WATERFALL COMING UP.

381
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:30,320
YEAH, IT'S A BIG ONE.

382
00:16:30,387 --> 00:16:31,855
70, 80 FEET, THERE.

383
00:16:31,922 --> 00:16:34,825
AS THE CANOE STARTS TO GO OVER,

384
00:16:34,891 --> 00:16:36,693
THEY START TO REALIZE--

385
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,161
UH-OH! AHH! AHH!

386
00:16:38,228 --> 00:16:40,364
SEE YOU IN A MINUTE, BOYS!

387
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,698
OHHH! OHHH!

388
00:16:41,765 --> 00:16:45,135
WELL, I'LL TELL YA,
WITH HAROLD AND BILL,

389
00:16:45,202 --> 00:16:49,539
A DAY AT THE BEACH IS OBVIOUSLY
NO DAY AT THE BEACH.

390
00:16:49,606 --> 00:16:51,007
OH, YOU'RE FINE.

391
00:16:51,074 --> 00:16:53,610
GOIN' BACK SHOULD BE TOUGH.

392
00:16:55,245 --> 00:17:00,117
MY FRIENDS IN SOUTH DAKOTA
MADE ME PART OF MOUNT RUSHMORE.

393
00:17:04,354 --> 00:17:08,558
WE'RE TAKING OUR WINNINGS
FROM THE CHURCH CASINO NIGHT

394
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,194
AND ROLLING THEM
INTO COIN ROLLS.

395
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:12,763
(Audience laughing)

396
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:17,267
THE LITTLE ONES TAKE FOREVER,
SO WE'RE MAKING OUR OWN.

397
00:17:17,334 --> 00:17:19,002
56 BUCKS' WORTH, EH?

398
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:21,938
WE FIGURED OUT
HOW TO HIDE THE DEAL

399
00:17:22,005 --> 00:17:27,177
SO OUR WIVES WON'T SUSPECT WE
DIDN'T GO TO THE BASEBALL GAME.

400
00:17:27,244 --> 00:17:29,279
YOU'RE GIVING THE MONEY BACK?

401
00:17:29,346 --> 00:17:33,350
THESE YOUNG PEOPLE
WITH THEIR SENSE OF HUMOUR.

402
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,151
THAT COULD HAPPEN, RIGHT AFTER

403
00:17:35,218 --> 00:17:38,722
WE GIVE EVERYTHING AWAY
AND LEARN TO LEVITATE.

404
00:17:38,788 --> 00:17:40,490
OH, OK.

405
00:17:40,557 --> 00:17:43,026
NO, NO, THE TRICK
TO AVOID SUSPICION

406
00:17:43,093 --> 00:17:45,128
IS TO SPEND THE MONEY SLOWLY.

407
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:47,898
EACH GUY GETS 25 NICKELS A DAY
TO BLOW.

408
00:17:47,964 --> 00:17:49,232
YOU KNOW WHAT?

409
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:51,101
YOU COULD LIVE OFF THE INTEREST

410
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:53,937
IF YOU PUT THAT IN THE BANK...
IF YOU'RE ALLOWED

411
00:17:54,004 --> 00:17:55,272
BACK IN
A BANK?

412
00:17:55,338 --> 00:17:57,007
NO, NO, THEY'D USE IT

413
00:17:57,073 --> 00:17:58,341
AGAINST OUR LOAN.

414
00:17:58,408 --> 00:18:00,277
WHERE'S THE SENSE IN THAT?

415
00:18:00,343 --> 00:18:02,679
SO WHAT WE'RE DOIN' IS...

416
00:18:02,746 --> 00:18:04,447
WHAT WE'RE DOIN'...

417
00:18:04,514 --> 00:18:06,883
WE'RE HIDING THE NICKELS.

418
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,752
YEAH.

419
00:18:08,818 --> 00:18:10,787
WHERE? WHERE?
WHERE? WHERE?

420
00:18:10,854 --> 00:18:13,423
PULL UP A CHAIR
AND I'LL TELL YOU.

421
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,924
AHHH!

422
00:18:14,991 --> 00:18:16,426
(Laughing)

423
00:18:16,493 --> 00:18:17,761
YEAH!

424
00:18:17,827 --> 00:18:19,929
YOU PUT THAT MONEY
IN THE CHAIR!

425
00:18:19,996 --> 00:18:23,366
IN THE CHAIRS, IN TABLE LEGS,
IN THE BED FRAMES...

426
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:26,102
OLD MAN SEDGWICK
IS PINNED UNDER HIS CANE.

427
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:27,437
WELL, WAIT,
WHOA, HEY...

428
00:18:27,504 --> 00:18:28,772
NOW, HEY, WHOA.

429
00:18:28,838 --> 00:18:30,106
YOU THINK
THAT'S SAFE,

430
00:18:30,173 --> 00:18:31,708
HAVING THINGS
SO HEAVY HERE?

431
00:18:31,775 --> 00:18:33,777
I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANY PROBLEM.

432
00:18:33,843 --> 00:18:35,278
(Roof creaking)

433
00:18:35,345 --> 00:18:36,780
WHAT'S THAT? OH!

434
00:18:36,846 --> 00:18:38,782
(Audience laughing)

435
00:18:38,848 --> 00:18:40,650
BOY, OH, BOY!

436
00:18:40,717 --> 00:18:42,652
IT'S SAGGING UP THERE, TOO!

437
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:44,788
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!

438
00:18:44,854 --> 00:18:47,791
(Grunting)

439
00:18:47,857 --> 00:18:49,359
GOT IT.

440
00:18:51,394 --> 00:18:53,263
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT PORTION,

441
00:18:53,329 --> 00:18:55,398
WHERE WE EXAMINE
THOSE THREE WORDS

442
00:18:55,465 --> 00:18:57,300
THAT MEN FIND SO HARD TO SAY...

443
00:18:57,367 --> 00:18:59,235
(Audience):
"I DON'T KNOW!"

444
00:18:59,302 --> 00:19:01,838
JOINING MY UNCLE RED
ON THIS PORTION

445
00:19:01,905 --> 00:19:04,808
IS HIS BEST FRIEND
IN THIS WHOLE WIDE ROOM,

446
00:19:04,874 --> 00:19:06,276
FERRYBOAT CAPTAIN

447
00:19:06,342 --> 00:19:07,811
HAP SHAUGHNESSY.

448
00:19:07,877 --> 00:19:11,581
(Applause and cheering)

449
00:19:11,648 --> 00:19:13,249
ALL RIGHT.

450
00:19:13,316 --> 00:19:16,619
LETTER GOES AS FOLLOWS:
"I'M A UNIVERSITY STUDENT.

451
00:19:16,686 --> 00:19:20,156
"AFTER LIVING IN A FRAT HOUSE,
I'VE BECOME AN EXPERT

452
00:19:20,223 --> 00:19:22,358
"ON ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
AND WILDLIFE.

453
00:19:22,425 --> 00:19:23,993
"SHOULD I SWITCH MY MAJOR

454
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,830
"FROM TELEVISION ARTS
TO VETERINARY SCIENCE,

455
00:19:26,896 --> 00:19:28,998
"ZOOLOGY, OR WILDLIFE
MANAGEMENT?"

456
00:19:29,065 --> 00:19:32,535
I'D SAY NO, BECAUSE ANIMALS
HAVE SHARP TEETH AND CLAWS.

457
00:19:32,602 --> 00:19:35,838
I WENT TO MARINE WORLD,
JUST OUTSIDE PORT ASBESTOS.

458
00:19:35,905 --> 00:19:39,342
AN OTTER SLAPPED ME SO HARD,
MY TACO CAME OUT MY NOSE.

459
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:40,843
THAT'S TRUE.

460
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,378
(Audience laughing)

461
00:19:42,445 --> 00:19:43,880
SO I'D SAY NO.

462
00:19:43,947 --> 00:19:46,316
(Laughing)

463
00:19:46,382 --> 00:19:48,851
WELL, BETTER HIM
THAN ME, HAROLD.

464
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:50,353
YEAH.

465
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:54,324
NOW THEY HAVE THE TRANQUILLIZER
DARTS AND SPECIAL EQUIPMENT,

466
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,293
IT'S NOT DANGEROUS
TO DO THAT KIND OF WORK.

467
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,628
OHHH, ANIMALS

468
00:19:58,695 --> 00:20:00,863
DON'T NEED TO BE DRUGGED.

469
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,433
THAT'S JUST PURE LAZINESS.

470
00:20:03,499 --> 00:20:06,803
(Audience laughing)

471
00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:10,406
WHEN I WORKED AT
THE WILDLIFE RESERVE IN KENYA,

472
00:20:10,473 --> 00:20:12,942
WE USED TO HAVE TO
TAG THE LIONS,

473
00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:16,546
MEASURE THEM FOR THEIR HEIGHT
AND THEIR WEIGHT,

474
00:20:16,612 --> 00:20:18,981
AND CHECK THEIR TEETH
AND SO ON,

475
00:20:19,048 --> 00:20:22,151
AND I NEVER ONCE USED
A TRANQUILLIZER DART

476
00:20:22,218 --> 00:20:23,853
TO PUT 'EM TO SLEEP.

477
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,622
DID YOU TELL 'EM
ONE OF YOUR STORIES?

478
00:20:26,689 --> 00:20:29,158
(Laughing)

479
00:20:30,493 --> 00:20:31,761
NO.

480
00:20:31,828 --> 00:20:34,731
NO, I'D WAIT
TILL HE WAS NAPPING.

481
00:20:34,797 --> 00:20:36,432
(Audience laughing)

482
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:37,767
THEN I'D CREEP OUT

483
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:41,137
AND I'D MEASURE HIM
FROM THE NOSE TO THE TAIL.

484
00:20:41,204 --> 00:20:44,240
I'D WEIGH HIM ON A SCALE,
CLEAN HIS TEETH,

485
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:46,342
AND STAPLE A TAG TO HIS EAR.

486
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:47,877
NOW,
MR. SHAUGHNESSY,

487
00:20:47,944 --> 00:20:49,445
I'M NO EXPERT ON LIONS,

488
00:20:49,512 --> 00:20:52,582
AND UNLIKE YOURSELF,
I'VE NEVER CLAIMED TO BE,

489
00:20:52,648 --> 00:20:56,352
BUT I WOULD IMAGINE THAT
STAPLING A TAG TO A LION'S EAR

490
00:20:56,419 --> 00:20:58,788
MIGHT MAKE HIM WAKE UP
AND BE ANGRY.

491
00:20:58,855 --> 00:21:00,490
YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

492
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:03,025
THAT'S WHY
I TAGGED THE EAR LAST, BECAUSE

493
00:21:03,092 --> 00:21:06,996
THEY RARELY SLEPT THROUGH THAT.

494
00:21:07,063 --> 00:21:08,331
IN A GOOD WEEK,

495
00:21:08,397 --> 00:21:12,335
I COULD TAG AND WEIGH
A WHOLE PRIDE OF LIONS.

496
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:16,172
YEAH, HAP, YOU'RE KNOWN
FOR YOUR PRIDE OF LYIN'.

497
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:17,807
(Audience laughing)

498
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,811
4,469...

499
00:21:21,878 --> 00:21:23,145
4,600--

500
00:21:23,212 --> 00:21:25,448
FIVE--
SEVEN... NINE...

501
00:21:25,514 --> 00:21:28,017
WHAT DID YOU
DO THAT FOR?

502
00:21:28,084 --> 00:21:30,586
WE'RE GIVING THE STUFF BACK,
ALL THE WINNINGS.

503
00:21:30,653 --> 00:21:32,622
GIVING IT BACK
TO THE CHURCH, HUH?

504
00:21:32,688 --> 00:21:35,658
YOUR CONSCIENCE
CAUGHT UP TO YOU.

505
00:21:35,725 --> 00:21:37,693
CONSCIENCE CAUGHT UP TO YOU.

506
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,962
NO, BERNICE CAUGHT UP TO ME.

507
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:42,231
YOU WEREN'T GONNA
TELL YOUR WIVES.

508
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:45,468
WE WEREN'T, BUT BERNICE IS
PSYCHIC OR SOMETHING.

509
00:21:45,534 --> 00:21:46,802
I GO IN THE HOUSE.

510
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:49,672
YOU KNOW ME, MR. CASUAL,
COOL AS A CUCUMBER.

511
00:21:49,739 --> 00:21:51,374
MR. POKER-FACE, YOU KNOW?

512
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,809
AND I'M SITTIN' THERE
AND SHE SAYS,

513
00:21:53,876 --> 00:21:55,678
"HOW WAS THE BASEBALL GAME?"

514
00:21:55,745 --> 00:21:57,647
I'M GOING, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

515
00:21:57,713 --> 00:22:00,282
"WHAT ARE YOU SAYING IT
THAT WAY FOR?

516
00:22:00,349 --> 00:22:01,984
"YOU THINK I DIDN'T GO?

517
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:03,986
"IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

518
00:22:04,053 --> 00:22:06,355
"YOU'RE ACCUSING ME
OF NOT GOING?

519
00:22:06,422 --> 00:22:08,424
"HEY, HEY! IT'S NOT MY FAULT

520
00:22:08,491 --> 00:22:10,593
"THE GUYS WENT
TO THE CASINO NIGHT."

521
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,728
VERY SMOOTH, UNCLE RED.

522
00:22:12,795 --> 00:22:14,530
(Audience laughing)

523
00:22:14,597 --> 00:22:17,199
SHE SEEMED TO BE ABLE
TO PUT IT TOGETHER.

524
00:22:17,266 --> 00:22:18,801
SHE'S PSYCHIC, I'M TELLING YA.

525
00:22:18,868 --> 00:22:20,136
(Possum squeal)

526
00:22:20,202 --> 00:22:21,470
THERE'S
THE POSSUM SQUEAL

527
00:22:21,537 --> 00:22:22,972
SO IT'S
MEETING TIME.

528
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,340
YOU GO AHEAD, HAROLD.

529
00:22:24,407 --> 00:22:26,308
AND IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

530
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:29,712
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

531
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:32,181
I'VE COLLECTED UP
ALL THE NICKELS.

532
00:22:32,248 --> 00:22:33,816
GOT EVERY LAST NICKEL.

533
00:22:33,883 --> 00:22:36,252
THERE ISN'T ONE...

534
00:22:36,318 --> 00:22:38,320
FOR GOSH SAKES.

535
00:22:38,387 --> 00:22:39,588
YOU'RE GOOD, BERNICE.

536
00:22:39,655 --> 00:22:41,957
THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

537
00:22:42,024 --> 00:22:44,627
ON BEHALF OF HAROLD
AND MYSELF AND THE GANG,

538
00:22:44,693 --> 00:22:46,395
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

539
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,336
(Possum squeal)

540
00:22:54,403 --> 00:22:55,838
(Harold): HE'S HERE!

541
00:22:55,905 --> 00:22:58,841
(Harold imitating trumpet)

542
00:22:58,908 --> 00:23:01,844
I SHOULDN'T PLAY THE BAT.

543
00:23:01,911 --> 00:23:03,779
(Red): THERE YOU GO.

544
00:23:03,846 --> 00:23:05,781
GET UP, GUYS.

545
00:23:05,848 --> 00:23:09,285
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

546
00:23:09,351 --> 00:23:10,920
(Red): SIT DOWN, GUYS.

547
00:23:10,986 --> 00:23:12,655
I'VE MANAGED TO COLLECT

548
00:23:12,721 --> 00:23:14,156
ALL THE NICKELS BACK

549
00:23:14,223 --> 00:23:15,958
AND THERE'S NO ADMISSION

550
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:17,493
AT THE PEARLY GATES.

551
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,949
TO JOIN
POSSUM LODGE
BOY, THIS IS TOO MUCH!
