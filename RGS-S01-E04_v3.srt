00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:00,592
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

171
00:06:00,592 --> 00:06:01,660
IT GETS IN YOUR SYSTEM, AND IT

172
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,362
MAKES YOUR STOMACH WALL BLACK.

173
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,263
THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD COOK IN A

174
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:04,963
STOVE.

175
00:06:04,963 --> 00:06:05,998
>> NO, NO, NO, THAT'S CARBON.

176
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,966
THAT'S WHAT PLANTS EAT, CARBON.

177
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:09,034
>> BURNT HOT DOGS?

178
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:10,402
THINK AGAIN.

179
00:06:10,402 --> 00:06:11,236
THERE'S NO WAY THAT A PLANT'S

180
00:06:11,236 --> 00:06:12,504
GONNA TAKE THE TIME TO PUT A HOT

181
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:13,539
DOG ON A STICK.

182
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,740
THEY'D HAVE TO TEAR ITS OWN STEM

183
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,041
OFF TO DO THAT.

184
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:16,942
IT JUST WOULDN'T HAPPEN.

185
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:18,811
THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE STOVES, FOR

186
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:19,878
PLANTS TO EAT PROPERLY.

187
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:20,846
>> NO, NO, NO, THEY DON'T HAVE

188
00:06:20,846 --> 00:06:22,114
STOVES FOR PLANTS.

189
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:23,815
>> YES, THEY DO.

190
00:06:23,815 --> 00:06:25,517
IT'S A HOT HOUSE.

191
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:26,385
>> THAT'S NOT A STOVE FOR A

192
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,119
PLANT.

193
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:29,087
>> HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN ONE?

194
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:31,223
>> WELL, AS A STAG, I WAS.

195
00:06:31,223 --> 00:06:32,391
WHAT DID YOU SAY AGAIN?

196
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,058
>> A HOT HOUSE.

197
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:34,159
>> OH, NO, NO, I'M SORRY.

198
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,128
I'M SORRY, MY MISTAKE.

199
00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:44,903
"IT IS WINTER.

200
00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:47,439
CHILDREN RUSH PAST PULLING SLEDS

201
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,441
AND TOBOGGANS, SHOPPERS HURRY

202
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:51,543
BY, HEADS BOWED AGAINST THE

203
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:54,046
WIND, AND TO EACH YOU CALL OUT A

204
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,948
FAMILIAR REFRAIN,

205
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,983
'CALL 9-1-1, I'VE SLIPPED AND

206
00:06:57,983 --> 00:07:00,052
BROKEN MY BACK.'"

207
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,288
ANYWAY, JUST TO GET BACK

208
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:04,356
TO THIS BURIED TREASURE THING,

209
00:07:04,356 --> 00:07:06,024
THIS WAS KIND OF EXCITING.

210
00:07:06,024 --> 00:07:07,025
WE'RE ALL UP THERE IN THE ATTIC,

211
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:08,961
AND THEY GOT THE TREASURE MAP

212
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:10,796
OUT, AND WE POURED OVER IT,

213
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:12,164
AND WE POURED AROUND IT;

214
00:07:12,164 --> 00:07:13,465
WE EVEN POURED SOME RIGHT ON IT,

215
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:15,200
YOU KNOW, AND TRYING TO FIGURE

216
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,702
OUT EXACTLY WHERE THE "X" WAS,

217
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:17,969
AND WE FIGURED OUT THAT IT WAS

218
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:20,072
PROBABLY HALFWAY BETWEEN THE

219
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,040
LODGE AND THE OLD MILL DOWN THE

220
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,475
ROAD, BUT NOW THE OLD MILL, OF

221
00:07:23,475 --> 00:07:25,243
COURSE, DIDN'T SHOW UP ON THE

222
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:26,244
MAP, BECAUSE IT'S LESS THAN 400

223
00:07:26,244 --> 00:07:27,713
YEARS OLD, BUT THE LODGE WAS

224
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,047
THERE.

225
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:30,615
SO ANYWAY, OFF WE GO.

226
00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:32,584
WE TOOK COMPASSES AND MAPS AND

227
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:34,853
ROPES AND PICKAXES AND A

228
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:38,056
BACKHOE, AND WE GOT THERE ABOUT

229
00:07:38,056 --> 00:07:39,024
2:00 IN THE AFTERNOON.

230
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:40,459
WE FIGURED WE WERE RIGHT IN THE

231
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:41,893
PERFECT SPOT WHERE A PIRATE WITH

232
00:07:41,893 --> 00:07:42,861
BURIED TREASURE,

233
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:44,429
WENT RIGHT ON TOP OF A HILL

234
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:46,298
UNDER SOME TREES, EASY TO SPOT,

235
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:48,733
AND ONLY ABOUT 500 MILES FROM

236
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:50,001
THE SEA.

237
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:51,269
>> EXCUSE ME, UNCLE RED, THERE'S

238
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:52,003
BEEN SOMETHING I HAVE BEEN

239
00:07:52,003 --> 00:07:52,838
WANTING TO DO EVER SINCE YOU

240
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:54,806
STARTED TALKING.

241
00:07:57,809 --> 00:07:58,710
>> WELL, WHERE ARE WE NOW,

242
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,911
HAROLD?

243
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:02,380
>> I'LL DRAW YOU A MAP.

244
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,350
[laughter]

245
00:08:06,852 --> 00:08:07,586
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

246
00:08:07,586 --> 00:08:09,554
THERE'S NOTHING MORE FUN THAN

247
00:08:09,554 --> 00:08:12,057
FISHING WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND.

248
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:15,293
>> WELL, THIS COMES CLOSE, RED.

249
00:08:15,293 --> 00:08:16,194
>> IT'S A GREAT DAY--

250
00:08:16,194 --> 00:08:17,829
NOT TOO SUNNY, NOT TOO WINDY.

251
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:20,532
>> WELL, THE WIND IS GONNA COME

252
00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:24,135
UP LATER FROM THE SOUTHWEST.

253
00:08:24,135 --> 00:08:25,904
OUGHT TO GET TO ABOUT 30, 35,

254
00:08:25,904 --> 00:08:27,472
TAPER OFF AROUND SUNDOWN.

255
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:29,174
SCATTERED SHOWERS OVERNIGHT.

256
00:08:29,174 --> 00:08:32,544
SUN WOULD RISE AT 6:37 TOMORROW.

257
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:33,245
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL THAT

258
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:34,512
STUFF?

259
00:08:34,512 --> 00:08:35,580
>> YOU GOT TO KNOW HOW TO READ

260
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,581
THE WEATHER WHEN YOU'RE A

261
00:08:36,581 --> 00:08:37,749
FARMER.

262
00:08:37,749 --> 00:08:38,483
>> FARMER, HUH?

263
00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:39,584
YOU WERE A FARMER?

264
00:08:39,584 --> 00:08:42,420
>> OH, SURE, BACK IN MY 20s.

265
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,388
BOUGHT ME A LITTLE SPREAD OUT

266
00:08:43,388 --> 00:08:45,690
WEST, STARTED A FARM.

267
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,260
>> WHAT DID YOU GROW, WHEAT?

268
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,762
>> NO, RUBBER.

269
00:08:50,762 --> 00:08:52,097
ANYBODY CAN GROW WHEAT.

270
00:08:52,097 --> 00:08:53,031
HOW MANY RUBBER FARMERS DO YOU

271
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:53,999
KNOW, RED?

272
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:56,001
>> JUST YOU.

273
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:58,370
>> WELL, I BOUGHT ME THIS LITTLE

274
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,806
PIECE OF LAND AND 240 RUBBER

275
00:09:01,806 --> 00:09:04,476
TREES FROM--WHERE'S THAT COUNTRY

276
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:06,311
WITH THE THINGS?

277
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:08,747
>> MALAYSIA?

278
00:09:08,747 --> 00:09:10,048
>> YEAH, YEAH.

279
00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:11,116
ANYWAY, I PLANTED THESE RUBBER

280
00:09:11,116 --> 00:09:14,119
TREES RIGHT IN THE PRAIRIES.

281
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:15,320
>> I ALWAYS THOUGHT RUBBER TREES

282
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,955
WOULD ONLY GROW IN A TROPICAL

283
00:09:16,955 --> 00:09:19,557
RAIN FOREST.

284
00:09:19,557 --> 00:09:21,359
>> WE HAD THEM IN GREENHOUSES,

285
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:24,262
BIG GREENHOUSES, ATTACHED TO THE

286
00:09:24,262 --> 00:09:26,131
BACK OF A TIRE FACTORY.

287
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:27,732
A BLOB OF RUBBER OOZES IN ONE

288
00:09:27,732 --> 00:09:29,401
END, AND STEEL-BELTED,

289

WHITEWALL, RADIAL, BIAS-PLY

SNOW TIRES POP OUT THE OTHER.

291
00:09:33,037 --> 00:09:34,239
I WAS ALL SET TO MAKE MY FIRST

292
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:36,241
TIRE AND TURN A LITTLE PROFIT

293
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:38,176
WHEN ALL MY CREDITORS CLOSED IN

294
00:09:38,176 --> 00:09:40,211
ALL AT ONCE.

295
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:41,446
THE ONLY RUBBER THAT FACTORY

296
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:44,983
EVER PRODUCED WAS MY OWN CHECKS.

297
00:09:44,983 --> 00:09:45,817
>> YEAH.

298
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:46,684
CREDITORS ARE LIKE THAT

299
00:09:46,684 --> 00:09:48,520
SOMETIMES.

300
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,921
>> BUT WAIT, IT GETS TO ME WHEN

301
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:50,889
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE A WORD THEY

302
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:52,390
SAY.

303
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,359
>> YEAH, I KNOW THE FEELING.

304
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,329
[folksy guitar and spoons music plays]

305
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:02,000
OH, SHE'S FULL OF RUST

306
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,501
AND THE BRAKES ARE SHOT

307
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:04,669
THE TIRES ARE BALD

308
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:06,171
AND SHE SHAKES A LOT

309
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:07,405
SHE BURNS A LOT OF OIL

310
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:08,740
AND SHE'S HARD ON GAS

311
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,542
BUT I GOT 37 MORE PAYMENTS

312
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:12,777
SO I'LL BE KEEPING HER

313
00:10:15,046 --> 00:10:16,314

314
00:10:16,314 --> 00:10:16,981
GREAT.

315
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:17,849
WE GOT SUCH AN EXCELLENT LETTER

316
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:18,516
TODAY.

317
00:10:18,516 --> 00:10:19,784
IT'S FROM THE YUKON.

318
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:21,152
YEAH, I PUT THE STAMP IN MY TIME

319
00:10:21,152 --> 00:10:23,087
CAPSULE.

320
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:23,788
>> THE YUKON, EH, HAROLD?

321
00:10:23,788 --> 00:10:24,455
>> YEAH.

322
00:10:24,455 --> 00:10:25,557

326
00:10:30,862 --> 00:10:32,564
THEY GOT THE GOLD RUSH UP THERE

327
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:33,598
AND POLAR BEARS, PENGUINS.

328
00:10:33,598 --> 00:10:34,666
IT'S QUITE A PLACE.

00:10:35,566 --> 00:10:36,634

THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT PEOPLE

00:10:45,376 --> 00:10:46,344
THEY THINK OF THE YUKON AS THE

338
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:47,912
LAND OF THE MIDNIGHT SUN WITH

339
00:10:47,912 --> 00:10:49,580
EVERYONE ON DOGSLEDS LIVING IN

340
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,715
IGLOOS AND HUNTING SEALS FOR SIX

341
00:10:50,715 --> 00:10:53,351
MONTHS OF DAYLIGHT.

342
00:10:53,351 --> 00:10:55,053
TOURISTS ASK US WHERE THE GOLD

343
00:10:55,053 --> 00:10:56,621
RUSH IS AND WHERE THEY CAN FIND

344
00:10:56,621 --> 00:10:58,222
POLAR BEARS AND PENGUINS.

345
00:10:58,222 --> 00:10:59,490
WHAT KIND OF IDIOT DOESN'T KNOW

346
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,491
THAT PENGUINS ARE ONLY IN THE

347
00:11:00,491 --> 00:11:03,728
SOUTH POLE?"

348
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:04,829
>> I THINK THE MAIN PROBLEM

349
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:07,065
THERE IS WITH THE FOREIGNERS.

350
00:11:07,065 --> 00:11:08,733
YOU KNOW, THEY GO UP NORTH, AND

351
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:09,967
THEY'RE EXPECTING TO SEE

352
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:11,202
SNOWMOBILES AND MOUNTIES, YOU

353
00:11:11,202 --> 00:11:12,136
KNOW, AND WHEN'S THE LAST TIME

354
00:11:12,136 --> 00:11:13,805
YOU SAW A MOUNTIE, HAROLD?

355
00:11:13,805 --> 00:11:14,839
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN A

356
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:15,673
MOUNTIE, YOU KNOW?

357
00:11:15,673 --> 00:11:16,441
I DON'T THINK MOUNTIES EVEN

358
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:17,575
EXIST.

359
00:11:17,575 --> 00:11:18,710
HOW ABOUT THIS VIEWER?

360
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,877
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME HE SAW A

361
00:11:19,877 --> 00:11:20,912
MOUNTIE, MR.--UH, DOES HE GIVE

362
00:11:20,912 --> 00:11:21,579
HIS NAME THERE?

363
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:22,947
>> YEAH, IN FACT, IT'S, UM,

364
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:23,981
"CORPORAL H. BENSON OF THE

365
00:11:23,981 --> 00:11:25,416
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE

366
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,052
WHITE HORSE DETACHMENT."

367
00:11:28,052 --> 00:11:29,954
>> UH, OKAY, SORRY, UH, SORRY,

368
00:11:29,954 --> 00:11:31,956
CORPORATE BENSON, UH, NO

369
00:11:31,956 --> 00:11:33,758
OFFENSE, SIR, YOU GUYS ARE DOING

370
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:35,726
A GREAT JOB AND, UH, IT'S A

371
00:11:35,726 --> 00:11:36,928
GREAT CANADIAN TRADITION THAT

372
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:38,729
YOU'RE CARRYING ON THERE, YOU

373
00:11:38,729 --> 00:11:40,498
FELLAS UP--I'LL TELL YOU--I'LL

374
00:11:40,498 --> 00:11:41,732
TELL YOU ONE THING, CORPORAL H.

375
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:43,901
BENSON, IF WE HAVE TO HAVE ONE

376
00:11:43,901 --> 00:11:46,370
STEREOTYPE, THEN LET IT BE THE

377
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,239
CANADIAN MOUNTIE IN HIS BRIGHT

378
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:48,973
RED UNIFORM.

379
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:50,608
I SALUTE YOU, SIR.

380
00:11:50,608 --> 00:11:52,210
>> RED, THE "H" STANDS FOR

381
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,178
HELEN.

382
00:11:59,717 --> 00:12:01,419
>> WE GOT ANOTHER WINTER

383
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:02,753
ACTIVITY WE'RE FEATURING ON OUR

384
00:12:02,753 --> 00:12:03,988
ADVENTURES WITH BILL SEGMENT

385
00:12:03,988 --> 00:12:05,323
THIS WEEK.

386
00:12:05,323 --> 00:12:06,390
THIS, OF COURSE, IS, AS YOU CAN

387
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,159
TELL, A SNOWSHOE.

388
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,227
NOW THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO

389
00:12:09,227 --> 00:12:10,528
DO IS TO MEASURE THE SNOWSHOES.

390
00:12:10,528 --> 00:12:12,096
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE--

391
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:12,763
GOD, THAT HURT.

392
00:12:12,763 --> 00:12:14,232
I REMEMBER THAT, YEAH.

393
00:12:14,232 --> 00:12:15,166
IT'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE SOMETHING

394
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:15,833
TO DO WITH YOUR HEIGHT.

395
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,101
ANYWAY, BILL IS AN ABSOLUTE

396
00:12:17,101 --> 00:12:19,503
EXPERT ON SNOWSHOEING.

397
00:12:19,503 --> 00:12:20,605
I THINK HE'S BEEN SNOWSHOEING

398
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:24,775
EVER SINCE HE WAS, UH, SMALLER.

399
00:12:24,775 --> 00:12:26,344
SO I WAS JUST GUESSING HOW TO

400
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:27,011
PUT THEM ON.

401
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:30,147
I DIDN'T REALIZE THERE WAS A--

402
00:12:30,147 --> 00:12:30,815
THERE WAS A, YOU KNOW,

403
00:12:30,815 --> 00:12:33,150
A BETTER TECHNIQUE.

404
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,251
BUT THEN AGAIN, LIKE, BILL'S

405
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:35,052
BEEN DOING IT, UH,

406
00:12:35,052 --> 00:12:36,754
DOING IT FOR QUITE A WHILE, AND,

407
00:12:36,754 --> 00:12:37,822
UH, I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE PAID

408
00:12:37,822 --> 00:12:40,424
MORE ATTENTION TO HIM.

409
00:12:40,424 --> 00:12:41,092
MIND YOU, HE DID GET MY

410
00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:43,694
ATTENTION THERE, BUT I THINK

411
00:12:43,694 --> 00:12:44,562
WHAT HAPPENED THERE, BILL JUST

412
00:12:44,562 --> 00:12:45,696
GOT FED UP WITH ME NOT DOING IT

413
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:47,398
THE RIGHT WAY AND JUST DECIDED

414
00:12:47,398 --> 00:12:49,367
HE JUST WOULDN'T DO IT.

415
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:51,469
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW, HE'S GOOD

416
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:52,203
THAT WAY.

417
00:12:52,203 --> 00:12:56,140
YOU KNOW, HE'S NOT PUSHY.

418
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,041
GOLLY, THOSE ARE KIND OF CROSSED

419
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,509
OVER EACH OTHER.

420
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:00,144
WELL, AS THEY SAY, HE KNOWS WHAT

421
00:13:00,144 --> 00:13:03,814
HE--YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES, PEOPLE

422
00:13:03,814 --> 00:13:05,616
ARE BETTER TEACHERS THAN THEY

423
00:13:05,616 --> 00:13:07,918
ARE AT ACTUALLY, UH--ACTUALLY

424
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:10,354
DOING THE ACTIVITY, AND I THINK,

425
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:11,655
YEAH, I THINK BILL KIND OF FALLS

426
00:13:11,655 --> 00:13:12,790
INTO THAT CATEGORY WHEN YOU'RE

427
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,093
TALKING ABOUT SNOWSHOEING,

428
00:13:16,093 --> 00:13:17,128
UNLESS THIS IS A TECHNIQUE

429
00:13:17,128 --> 00:13:18,195
THAT'S DESIGNED FOR SOME

430
00:13:18,195 --> 00:13:20,965
SPECIFIC LEARNER.

431
00:13:20,965 --> 00:13:22,333
NO, I THINK THAT'S JUST PLAIN

432
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,400
WRONG.

433
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,369
ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS

434
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:26,837
WITH SNOWSHOEING IS TURNING

435
00:13:26,837 --> 00:13:28,539
AROUND, BECAUSE THEY'RE A LOT

436
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:29,840
BIGGER THAN A REGULAR SOLE,

437
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,875
BUT I JUST--AGAIN, I WAS

438
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,877
GUESSING HERE, BUT, UH, BILL HAS

439
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:35,579
A REALLY INTERESTING TECHNIQUE.

440
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:39,650
AND YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAVE A LOT

441
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:40,618
OF TIME ON YOUR HANDS, I THINK

442
00:13:40,618 --> 00:13:41,652
THIS IS THE RIGHT TECHNIQUE TO

443
00:13:41,652 --> 00:13:45,156
USE.

444
00:13:45,156 --> 00:13:48,459
CERTAINLY INTERESTING TO WATCH.

445
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:50,828
AND IT DOES SCARE ALL THE

446
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:52,663
WILDLIFE AWAY.

447
00:13:52,663 --> 00:13:54,131
THERE'S THAT ASPECT.

448
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:55,799
NOW BILL'S GONNA SHOW YOU

449
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:57,902
SEVERAL TECHNIQUES OF TURNING

450
00:13:57,902 --> 00:13:58,569
AROUND.

451
00:13:58,569 --> 00:13:59,270
THIS ONE, I THOUGHT, WAS

452
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,139
PARTICULARLY, UH, I GUESS,

453
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:03,173
CREATIVE, FOR LACK OF A BETTER

454
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:05,142
WORD.

455
00:14:08,012 --> 00:14:11,315
AND THERE HE GOES.

456
00:14:11,315 --> 00:14:12,149
YEAH, THAT WORKED REAL WELL.

457
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:14,685
NOW HERE'S ONE, TOO, THAT, YOU

458
00:14:14,685 --> 00:14:16,086
KNOW, AGAIN, A WHOLE DIFFERENT

459
00:14:16,086 --> 00:14:18,555
TECHNIQUE, BUT, UH, YOU KNOW, IF

460
00:14:18,555 --> 00:14:19,890
YOU'RE CREATIVE AND IF YOU HAVE

461
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:22,793
A 6-FOOT STAFF, THERE YOU

462
00:14:22,793 --> 00:14:24,561
GO, AND HE'S RIGHT AROUND, AND,

463
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:25,996
UH, AND AWAY WE GO.

464
00:14:25,996 --> 00:14:28,465
YOU KNOW, AS THEY SAY, FOR ME, I

465
00:14:28,465 --> 00:14:29,566
WOULD JUST TURN ON THE

466
00:14:29,566 --> 00:14:31,402
SNOWSHOES, BUT HE LOVED THIS

467
00:14:31,402 --> 00:14:32,069
ONE.

468
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:32,836
HE WANTED TO TRY THIS A FEW

469
00:14:32,836 --> 00:14:33,771
TIMES.

470
00:14:33,771 --> 00:14:37,207
OH, BOY.

471
00:14:37,207 --> 00:14:38,342
NOW HERE'S SOMETHING REAL

472
00:14:38,342 --> 00:14:39,176
INTERESTING.

473
00:14:39,176 --> 00:14:41,078
YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN SNOWSHOES

474
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:43,514
OUT OF A SET OF TIRES.

475
00:14:43,514 --> 00:14:45,683
THIS WAS KIND OF--

476
00:14:45,683 --> 00:14:47,184
UH, WE ALWAYS KID BILL;

477
00:14:47,184 --> 00:14:49,353
HE'S KIND OF A PULL START.

478
00:14:49,353 --> 00:14:50,187
WELL, ANYWAY, YEAH, YOU CAN

479
00:14:50,187 --> 00:14:50,854
MAKE IT.

480
00:14:50,854 --> 00:14:51,989
YOU PUT YOUR FOOT IN THE TIRE,

481
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:52,823
IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE SNOW

482
00:14:52,823 --> 00:14:54,391
TIRES, YOU KNOW, AND THEN USE

483
00:14:54,391 --> 00:14:57,261
ROPE TO MAKE THE WEBBING FOR IT,

484
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:58,629
SO WE GOT BILL'S ONE LEG IN

485
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:00,197
THERE, AND THEN WE GOT KIND OF

486
00:15:00,197 --> 00:15:01,365
KIBITZING AROUND, WELL, I DID.

487
00:15:01,365 --> 00:15:02,566
YEAH, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,

488
00:15:02,566 --> 00:15:03,434
YEAH, HE REACHED FOR THE OTHER

489
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:04,668
TIRE AND HE KIND OF FELL DOWN,

490
00:15:04,668 --> 00:15:06,870
AND YOU KNOW, WHAT I DID WAS I

491
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,704
THOUGHT I'D HAVE SOME FUN WITH

492
00:15:07,704 --> 00:15:09,373
HIM, SO I GOT THE TIRES UP, AND

493
00:15:09,373 --> 00:15:10,941
I THOUGHT I JUST WOULD JUST PUSH

494
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:12,342
HIM DOWN THE HILL, YOU KNOW?

495
00:15:12,342 --> 00:15:13,177
BILL LOVES THIS.

496
00:15:13,177 --> 00:15:16,313
HE REALLY ENJOYED THIS.

497
00:15:16,313 --> 00:15:17,581
WHEN HE SPOKE TO ME FROM THE

498
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:19,416
HOSPITAL, HE SAID, "YOU KNOW,

499
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,951
RED, THAT WAS REALLY DIFFERENT."

500
00:15:20,951 --> 00:15:21,985
THEN HE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS

501
00:15:21,985 --> 00:15:23,954
AGAIN.

502
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:26,123
I THINK THE BEST WAY TO TALK TO

503
00:15:26,123 --> 00:15:27,758
THE TEENAGERS OF TODAY IS TO

504
00:15:27,758 --> 00:15:29,560
JUST BE HONEST WITH THEM.

505
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,327
AND BELIEVE ME, I DON'T LIKE

506
00:15:30,327 --> 00:15:32,429
DOING THAT ANY MORE THAN YOU DO.

507
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:34,331
NOW I WANT TO TALK ABOUT GUNS.

508
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:35,232
NOW I KNOW THIS IS A HUNTING

509
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:36,633
LODGE AND YOU SEE LOTS OF GUNS

510
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:39,236
AND ANIMAL SKINS AROUND, BUT THE

511
00:15:39,236 --> 00:15:40,737
TRUTH IS IS THAT ALL OF THAT

512
00:15:40,737 --> 00:15:42,005
STUFF WAS HERE WHEN WE TOOK OVER

513
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:44,575
THE LODGE 25 YEARS AGO.

514
00:15:44,575 --> 00:15:45,809
TO MY KNOWLEDGE, NONE OF OUR

515
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:47,010
MEMBERS HAS EVER KILLED AN

516
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,145
ANIMAL WITH ANYTHING OTHER THAN

517
00:15:48,145 --> 00:15:50,280
A STEEL-BELTED RADIAL.

518
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,648
OH, YEAH, WE GO HUNTING, BUT WE

519
00:15:51,648 --> 00:15:53,684
DON'T TAKE ANY AMMO, AND WE SURE

520
00:15:53,684 --> 00:15:55,252
AS HECK DON'T KILL ANYTHING.

521
00:15:55,252 --> 00:15:56,353
AND IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE NOBODY

522
00:15:56,353 --> 00:15:59,022
WANTS TO CLEAN A BEAR.

523
00:15:59,022 --> 00:16:00,023
THE TRUTH IS, WE TALK A LOT

524
00:16:00,023 --> 00:16:01,491
ABOUT GUNS, BUT WE DON'T REALLY

525
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:02,426
USE THEM.

526
00:16:02,426 --> 00:16:04,094
SEE, THAT'S THE WAY MEN ARE--A

527
00:16:04,094 --> 00:16:06,196
LOT OF TALK, NOT MUCH ACTION.

528
00:16:06,196 --> 00:16:08,465
JUST ASK OUR WIVES.

529
00:16:08,465 --> 00:16:10,300
NOW THE TRUTH HURTS, BUT--BUT

530
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,603
THIS IS IMPORTANT, OR AT LEAST I

531
00:16:12,603 --> 00:16:15,072
THOUGHT IT WAS A MINUTE AGO.

532
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:17,608
WELL, WE WON'T AIR THIS ONE.

533
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:20,577
"IT IS WINTER.

534
00:16:20,577 --> 00:16:22,412
THE SNOW IS ON THE ROOFTOPS.

535
00:16:22,412 --> 00:16:24,348
THE SNOW IS ON THE TREE.

536
00:16:24,348 --> 00:16:26,350
THE WIND BLEW DOWN MY CABLE.

537
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,952
NOW THERE'S SNOW ON MY TV."

538
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:42,966
HEY, YOU KNOW, UH, WE GET THE

539
00:16:42,966 --> 00:16:44,434
ODD COMMENT THAT PEOPLE ARE

540
00:16:44,434 --> 00:16:46,403
GETTING TIRED OF HEARING ME

541
00:16:46,403 --> 00:16:47,404
TALK, SO WE WANTED TO DO

542
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:49,373
SOMETHING THAT WOULD REVERSE

543
00:16:49,373 --> 00:16:52,275
THAT PROCESS.

544
00:16:52,275 --> 00:16:54,845
>> OKAY, UM, BIG QUESTIONS,

545
00:16:54,845 --> 00:16:55,645
RIGHT?

546
00:16:55,645 --> 00:16:57,247
OKAY, WE GET SO CAUGHT UP IN

547
00:16:57,247 --> 00:16:58,815
DAY-TO-DAY EVENTS, LIKE, YOU

548
00:16:58,815 --> 00:17:00,417
KNOW, EATING AND SLEEPING AND

549
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:02,052
ROLLER DERBY AND STUFF, THAT WE

550
00:17:02,052 --> 00:17:04,321
FORGET ABOUT THE BIG QUESTIONS,

551
00:17:04,321 --> 00:17:05,388
RIGHT?

552
00:17:05,388 --> 00:17:08,258
LIKE, BIG QUESTIONS LIKE, WHY?

553
00:17:08,258 --> 00:17:09,793
OH, OH.

554
00:17:09,793 --> 00:17:10,527
THAT REMINDS ME OF ANOTHER

555
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:11,728
BIG QUESTION.

556
00:17:11,728 --> 00:17:13,830
WHO?

557
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:14,998
BIG QUESTIONS, RIGHT?

558
00:17:14,998 --> 00:17:17,667
WELL, LIKE, NOT PHYSICALLY BIG

559
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:18,902
QUESTIONS, RIGHT, LIKE, HEY, I'M

560
00:17:18,902 --> 00:17:20,704
NOT PHYSICALLY BIG, BUT I'M BIG

561
00:17:20,704 --> 00:17:22,072
PHILOSOPHICALLY.

562
00:17:22,072 --> 00:17:22,739
YEAH.

563
00:17:22,739 --> 00:17:24,107
AND MY LARGE INTESTINE IS OVER

564
00:17:24,107 --> 00:17:26,009
10 FEET LONG.

565
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:26,977
SO YOU FIGURE OUT WHY IT TAKES

566
00:17:26,977 --> 00:17:30,413
SO LONG TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

567
00:17:30,413 --> 00:17:32,616
OKAY, THESE ARE BIG QUESTIONS.

568
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:33,850
AND BIG QUESTIONS NEED BIG

569
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,886
ANSWERS, RIGHT?

570
00:17:35,886 --> 00:17:36,820
I GOT THEM.

571
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,889
I GOT THE BIG ANSWER.

572
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:40,857
ALIENS.

573
00:17:40,857 --> 00:17:43,760
ALIENS--WE'RE NOT ALONE. NO WAY.

574
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,928
BUT YOU KNOW, I'D REALLY PREFER

575
00:17:44,928 --> 00:17:45,929
TO TALK ABOUT THIS LATER,

576
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:46,696
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO MISS

577
00:17:46,696 --> 00:17:48,965
STAR TREK.

578
00:17:48,965 --> 00:17:50,133
OKAY? OKAY.

579
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:52,102
THANK YOU.

580
00:17:53,603 --> 00:17:54,738
>> STAY TUNED TO FIND OUT HOW

581
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:56,273
THE TREASURE HUNT TURNED OUT.

582
00:17:56,273 --> 00:17:57,908
>> BIG HINT--WE'RE STILL DOING

583
00:17:57,908 --> 00:17:59,876
THE SHOW.

584
00:18:08,918 --> 00:18:11,321
>> IMAGINE IF SUPERMAN EVER GOT

585
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:12,622
INTO A FIGHT WITH ANYBODY, HUH?

586
00:18:12,622 --> 00:18:14,090
HE'S QUITE A GUY.

587
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,759
>> HE CAN TAKE ANYBODY ALMOST.

588
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:17,227
>> ANYBODY--NOT ALMOST, ANYBODY.

589
00:18:17,227 --> 00:18:18,261
>> NO, ALMOST.

590
00:18:18,261 --> 00:18:20,263
BATMAN COULD TAKE SUPERMAN IN AN

591
00:18:20,263 --> 00:18:21,364
INSTANT.

592
00:18:21,364 --> 00:18:22,966
>> OH, GET OUT OF MY FACE.

593
00:18:22,966 --> 00:18:24,334
>> I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO, BECAUSE

594
00:18:24,334 --> 00:18:25,168
IT'S TRUE.

595
00:18:25,168 --> 00:18:27,070
>> BATMAN IS LIKE PHIL DONAHUE

596
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,071
WITH AN ATTITUDE.

597
00:18:28,071 --> 00:18:28,872
>> DON'T SAY THAT.

598
00:18:28,872 --> 00:18:29,539
THAT'S NOT EVEN TRUE.

599
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:30,340
BATMAN IS WAY BETTER THAN

600
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,007
SUPERMAN.

601
00:18:31,007 --> 00:18:32,208
>> HE HAS NO SUPER POWER.

602
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:32,876
>> YES, HE DOES.

603
00:18:32,876 --> 00:18:33,576
>> I DON'T THINK HE DOES.

604
00:18:33,576 --> 00:18:34,944
>> HE'S GOT PSYCHOLOGICAL POWERS

605
00:18:34,944 --> 00:18:35,645
OVER SUPERMAN.

606
00:18:35,645 --> 00:18:36,379
>> OH, WELL, HOW DOES THAT

607
00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:37,947
COMPARE WITH X-RAY VISION?

608
00:18:37,947 --> 00:18:39,149
>> EASY, BECAUSE HE CAN JUST

609
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:40,383
THINK ABOUT STUFF,

610
00:18:40,383 --> 00:18:41,284
AND WHILE SUPERMAN'S LOOKING

611
00:18:41,284 --> 00:18:42,452
AROUND THROUGH WALLS, HE CAN

612
00:18:42,452 --> 00:18:43,920
SNEAK UP ON HIM WITH BRAIN

613
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,587
ATTACK.

614
00:18:44,587 --> 00:18:45,822
>> OH, YEAH, HOW ABOUT BEING

615
00:18:45,822 --> 00:18:47,323
ABLE TO STOP BULLETS?

616
00:18:47,323 --> 00:18:48,458
YOU KNOW, FASTER THAN A SPEEDING

617
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,125
LOCOMOTIVE?

618
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:49,993
GIVE ME SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

619
00:18:49,993 --> 00:18:50,660
ALL RIGHT?

620
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,961
ABLE TO JUMP TALL BUILDINGS WITH

621
00:18:51,961 --> 00:18:53,163
A SINGLE BOUND.

622
00:18:53,163 --> 00:18:53,930
>> HE'S A BAT.

623
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,198
HE CAN HANG UPSIDE DOWN.

624
00:18:55,198 --> 00:18:56,032
ALL THE BLOOD WOULD RUSH TO

625
00:18:56,032 --> 00:18:57,167
SUPERMAN'S HEAD, AND HE'D GET

626
00:18:57,167 --> 00:18:58,368
FOGGY, AND HIS X-RAY VISION

627
00:18:58,368 --> 00:18:59,068
WOULD GET ALL SCREWED UP.

628
00:18:59,068 --> 00:19:00,003
>> SUPERMAN WOULDN'T HANG UPSIDE

629
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:00,670
DOWN.

630
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,738
HE JUST WOULD FLOAT BESIDE HIM

631
00:19:01,738 --> 00:19:02,739
AND STING LIKE A BEE.

632
00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:03,673
>> HE DOESN'T HAVE HOVER

633
00:19:03,673 --> 00:19:04,507
ABILITIES.

634
00:19:04,507 --> 00:19:05,208
>> HE DOESN'T NEED HOVER

635
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:05,875
ABILITIES.

636
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:06,609
>> YEAH, BUT HE CAN'T FLOAT

637
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:07,477
BESIDE HIM, THEN, SEE?

638
00:19:07,477 --> 00:19:08,711
AND WHEN HE'S GOING SO FAST--

639
00:19:08,711 --> 00:19:10,146
>> HE HAS HOVER. HE HAS HOVER.

640
00:19:10,146 --> 00:19:11,381
HE HAS A HOVER SETTING.

641
00:19:11,381 --> 00:19:12,248
>> HE DOESN'T. NO, HE DOESN'T.

642
00:19:12,248 --> 00:19:13,316
>> YOU'VE NEVER SEEN HIS

643
00:19:13,316 --> 00:19:14,217
TRANSMISSION THE WAY I HAVE.

644
00:19:14,217 --> 00:19:16,586
>> NO, YOU'RE THINKING OF MR.

645
00:19:16,586 --> 00:19:17,520
AMERICA.

646
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,388
HE HAS HOVER ABILITY.

647
00:19:18,388 --> 00:19:19,389
>> HELICOPTER MAN.

648
00:19:19,389 --> 00:19:20,223
>> THAT'S THE GUY.

649
00:19:20,223 --> 00:19:22,458
>> YEAH.

650
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,927
NOW WE'RE OUT HERE ON LOCATION

651
00:19:23,927 --> 00:19:25,595
WITH MY GOOD BUDDY DOUGIE

652
00:19:25,595 --> 00:19:27,397
FRANKLIN, AND, DOUGIE, THIS IS A

653
00:19:27,397 --> 00:19:29,098
NICE SET OF WHEELS YOU GOT HERE.

654
00:19:29,098 --> 00:19:30,433
>> WELL, RED, IT OUGHT TO BE.

655
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:33,303
COST ME ABOUT $18,000.

656
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:34,837
>> WELL, STILL, THAT'S REALLY

657
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:36,039
NOT THAT, NOT THAT BAD FOR A

658
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:37,807
TRUCK THIS BIG.

659
00:19:37,807 --> 00:19:38,708
>> NO, NO, THAT WAS FOR THE

660
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:39,976
WHEELS, RED.

661
00:19:39,976 --> 00:19:41,711
THE TRUCK COST A LOT MORE.

662
00:19:41,711 --> 00:19:42,445
I MEAN, IT'S A LOT OF TRUCK

663
00:19:42,445 --> 00:19:44,180
THERE, AND IT'S A BIG ONE, AND

664
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,148
THAT'S WHY YOU GOT TO PAY MORE,

665
00:19:45,148 --> 00:19:46,015
AND THAT KIND OF MAKES IT ALL

666
00:19:46,015 --> 00:19:47,550
WORTHWHILE.

667
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,185
>> YEAH, YEAH.

668
00:19:49,185 --> 00:19:51,020
ACTUALLY, HOW TALL IS THIS

669
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,422
VEHICLE?

670
00:19:52,422 --> 00:19:53,156
