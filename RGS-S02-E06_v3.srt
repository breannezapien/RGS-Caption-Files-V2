1
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:25,225
But.

2
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,277
Gather around your television set and make
sure they're turned on because this is the

3
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:48,381
wildest wildlife show on the air, bringing
you thrills, chills, spills

4
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,115
And a really nice

5
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:51,184
View of our hallway right around now.

6
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:55,588
The show that dares to be different only
because we can't afford to be the same.

7
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:58,291
And here he is, the man who's the most
effort of them all.

8
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:02,495
The star of the show and through a cruel
twist of DNA fate, my uncle.

9
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,464
Here he is, the legal owner of the Red Green
Show.

10
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:08,268
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Red Green Girl.

11
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,703
Thank you, and welcome

12
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:12,906
To Possum Lodge. Not fancy, but it's paid
for.

13
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,175
We've got a good show for you this week.

14
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:19,712
Although I have no idea what Harold meant by
the thrills, chills and spills

15
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,015
Go rat, I was referring to my directorial
digitalizing.

16
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:24,417
That's what gives the show its cutting edge
film

17
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,322
That makes me feel like cutting the edge of
your digits, Harold.

18
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:31,291
It's the state of the art al gore.

19
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:35,528
Oh, I don't know about art, but I know what
I like and that doesn't even come close.

20
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,063
And don't you even come close, either?

21
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,500
Try to keep that nonsense to a minimum.

22
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,436
Got a bit of a situation going on at the
Lodge this week.

23
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:45,938
We're kind of trapped in the lodge.

24
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:47,473
Nobody can go outside.

25
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,042
Well, are we being audited again?

26
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,245
No. Well, there's a there's a bear outside a
bear

27
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:54,213
Like a real bear.

28
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,650
I would quads and fangs and stuff like a
bear, a bear.

29
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,619
Like, what if a bear breaks down the door?

30
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,421
Like just balls us to death for no reason?

31
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,622
We should shoot it. We should shoot it.

32
00:02:02,955 --> 00:02:08,995
Carol, Carol, Carol, you know, despite a lot
of misconceptions of which you are one that

33
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,131
bears don't just randomly, you know, mall
people and kill them.

34
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:16,369
Ok. If the bear comes in here and kills you,
it'll be to eat you.

35
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:18,871
But that's not going to happen, Harold,
because it'll sniff you first.

36
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:24,877
Now, this all got started when our cook,
Eddie made some honey raisin muffins.

37
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,346
Then he put them out on the back porch until
they stopped burning.

38
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,017
Oh, so like the bear was attracted by the
smell of Eddie's cooking.

39
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,152
No, no, no, no. Even bears aren't that
hungry.

40
00:02:34,253 --> 00:02:37,824
I'll tell you what happened. Oh man.
Sedgwick and Buster Hatfield went down to the

41
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,625
store to buy some bear repellent.

42
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:43,462
And Duane, you know, being Duane sold them
bear Musk by mistake.

43
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,364
Ok? Now to a bear bear.

44
00:02:45,364 --> 00:02:50,236
Musk is like a Madonna VIDEO And the Sports
Illustrated Swimsuit Issue all rolled into

45
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:54,607
one. So they came back here and they sprayed
out all over the place.

46
00:02:54,607 --> 00:03:00,079
And now what we have is a is a pretty eager
male bear, you know, kind of drooling around

47
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,881
the lodge there. Wait a second.

48
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:05,918
If they spray like Bear Musk all around, he's
not sniffing for food.

49
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:09,221
Oh, you're probably right.

50
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:13,059
And if he comes in here, he won't be hungry.

51
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:17,563
Well, what say we just get rolling with the
show and then we could barricade the door?

52
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:18,297
Yeah, good idea.

53
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,266
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

54
00:03:25,137 --> 00:03:27,139
To the very sniffing around, Rick Van.

55
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,777
You see the way he's sniffing the trailer
hitch must be mating season.

56
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,581
Here comes no one is fun for you.

57
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,283
Yeah. Does he know about the bear?

58
00:03:37,516 --> 00:03:39,885
I don't think so. I sure hope he sees it.

59
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:42,488
I don't think he does.

60
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:46,325
He doesn't even know about it.

61
00:03:47,893 --> 00:03:48,961
They're still out there, guys.

62
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:51,364
Yeah. Yeah, he's stalking me.

63
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,866
No, no. Doesn't even know it.

64
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:55,367
Look at him dicking around with his siren.

65
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,073
Well, he knows about it now.

66
00:04:03,442 --> 00:04:06,512
Oh, wow.

67
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,080
You sure can't motor.

68
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,750
Yeah. They moves pretty good for a dwarf.

69
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,619
Where's he going? Oh, shit.

70
00:04:14,987 --> 00:04:17,490
Well, Bump House looks like,

71
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:22,862
Oh, you know, I never seen a man hurl a
barbecue before.

72
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:24,430
Well, I'm going to go get my camera.

73
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,464
This is excellent.

74
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,035
Oh, look, look. The boat house is a lot.

75
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,305
I told him we didn't need all those locks.

76
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,074
The beer's gaining on him.

77
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:36,442
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

78
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:40,412
Oh boy. Come on, come on.

79
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:46,852
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah.

80
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,221
No. Oh, yeah, sure.

81
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:51,323
Do you like a drink or anything, just help
yourself there.

82
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:52,224
Ok?

83
00:04:56,562 --> 00:05:02,701
Starship Pantry one, 60 70 Investigate the
sighting of a bear near the lodge.

84
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:06,639
Light brown in color. Approximately 14 feet
tall.

85
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,676
Definitely male. What are you going to do
about it?

86
00:05:10,676 --> 00:05:13,979
Not me. Quick.

87
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,982
If you're referring, not nothing.

88
00:05:18,283 --> 00:05:19,785
Well, you're head of security there.

89
00:05:19,818 --> 00:05:21,453
That's why you're dressed like a fire truck
or nothing.

90
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:28,260
Look, when it starts breaking into the lodge
member's car or swiping cutlery.

91
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:29,662
Hey, I'm there for you, buddy.

92
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:31,196
The bears trespassing?

93
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:31,530
No.

94
00:05:31,563 --> 00:05:32,798
Well, actually. Helmet?

95
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:35,768
He's not. We're the ones who are trespassing
on his natural habitat.

96
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:39,171
See, because bears were here a long time
before us, and they will be here a long time

97
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:39,671
afterwards.

98
00:05:40,572 --> 00:05:41,807
Not if no one goes out and shoots them.

99
00:05:42,374 --> 00:05:44,376
Well, I hate. Ha ha.

100
00:05:45,277 --> 00:05:46,578
I'm not allowed to carry a gun.

101
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:50,282
You can burn one of mine. I'm not even
allowed to hold a gun.

102
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:54,153
Why don't you go out and do one of those
karate type one dork moves you're always

103
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:58,724
talking about? That would tell them that
bears a maintenance problem.

104
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:00,259
You're in charge of maintenance.

105
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,594
You get rid of it. Maintenance.

106
00:06:03,061 --> 00:06:04,897
What is the bear clog in the drains?

107
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:10,636
I must have missed that. No, but you are
responsible for clearing the pass in the

108
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:13,038
roadways so we can get to the vehicles.

109
00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:14,773
Well, I shovel snow.

110
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,608
I rake leaves anything that moves.

111
00:06:16,675 --> 00:06:17,843
You deal with right red.

112
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:20,746
Oh lord, you do guys settle this.

113
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:24,349
But whatever you do, sell it in a hurry
because sometime in the next two weeks,

114
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,285
somebody's going have to use that outhouse.

115
00:06:26,718 --> 00:06:28,820
You heard him go kill the bear, you coward.

116
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:30,422
He didn't say that.

117
00:06:30,722 --> 00:06:32,658
And don't you call me a coward, Mr?

118
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,128
Or else all or else what?

119
00:06:39,898 --> 00:06:41,199
He didn't say I'd kill the bear.

120
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:42,467
Ok, I got the

121
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:43,702
Camera figured out already.

122
00:06:43,735 --> 00:06:46,104
No, I'll go outside and do exactly what you
did before.

123
00:06:46,138 --> 00:06:47,139
Ok, this time I'm ready.

124
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:53,011
Come on. Oh, well, it's Murray and Dwayne.

125
00:06:53,278 --> 00:06:54,980
Oh, I got to get my wide angle lens for this
one.

126
00:06:57,549 --> 00:06:58,884
Oh, I don't think so.

127
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,154
All they do now.

128
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,757
This is fun. Wow.

129
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:08,327
He was that fast when I was running faster.

130
00:07:08,393 --> 00:07:09,528
Only your arms weren't flapping.

131
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:24,976
As I was walking through the woods one day, I
came upon a swag man jolly ing on his way.

132
00:07:26,178 --> 00:07:29,181
He said he was waltzing Matilda to a Billy
bar.

133
00:07:30,248 --> 00:07:33,085
And he refused to speak English, so I nailed
him.

134
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:47,966
This week in Handymen Corner, we're going to
show you how you can scare off a wild

135
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:52,971
animals, for example, bears, you know, bears
hardly ever take a swipe at anybody.

136
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:55,073
They're mostly noise and teeth, kind of like
Harold.

137
00:07:56,808 --> 00:08:00,979
But you know what you got to do is you got
to find a way to to scare them off.

138
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:03,682
And what we're going to make today is call a
bear scare.

139
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:07,819
See, because in the animal kingdom now a lot
of the fights are avoided by one of the

140
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:09,554
animals making a big display.

141
00:08:09,554 --> 00:08:14,059
You see a cat, but there's fur up, you know,
or a peacock or whip his tail out there or

142
00:08:14,726 --> 00:08:17,329
dogs or snarling owned and show their teeth.

143
00:08:17,362 --> 00:08:22,834
And the idea is you make yourself look real,
vicious and mean, or at least hard to

144
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:26,104
swallow. So what are you going to make our
bear scarier?

145
00:08:26,137 --> 00:08:27,339
You're going to need some things you're
going to need.

146
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,108
You're going need some marbles and you're
going to need some Hawaiian shirts.

147
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:33,678
You're going to need a backpack, aluminum
tent pegs.

148
00:08:33,678 --> 00:08:38,617
You're going to need some eyeballs, some
sash cord and some rubber gloves.

149
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,953
If you're looking for those things, you may
be able to find them all in Harold's closet.

150
00:08:42,887 --> 00:08:46,558
Now, the first thing I'm going to show you
is how you make the counterweight to

151
00:08:46,992 --> 00:08:48,326
noisemaker part of the deal.

152
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,963
You take a small town like this and you put
the marbles into the can.

153
00:08:56,935 --> 00:09:00,438
All right. And then you put the small can
upside down into the big can.

154
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:04,175
Ok, and then you just cover that over with
the handyman secret weapon.

155
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:06,044
You make two of those and they're your
noisemakers.

156
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:15,353
They work now they're going to make our
visual display.

157
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:25,096
To do that, we take our backpack, put it
into the vise and I'm going to stick

158
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:28,366
on these eyeballs in the top of the vertical
supports.

159
00:09:35,707 --> 00:09:40,545
Ok, so once we got our eyeballs on here,
we've added the pieces of PVC pipe to the

160
00:09:40,545 --> 00:09:44,516
side and we and we really hoist her down
there with the of our secret weapon again,

161
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:47,318
duct tape and again, be generous with the
duct tape.

162
00:09:47,318 --> 00:09:49,154
You don't spare the duct tape spoil the job.

163
00:09:49,454 --> 00:09:53,792
All right now we take some one of our pieces
of sash cord runs it through the eyeball.

164
00:09:53,858 --> 00:09:58,329
Ok, like this? The other end we've again
duct taped to the bottom of one of our tent

165
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:03,668
poles, and we dropped that down inside
inside the PVC pipe.

166
00:10:03,902 --> 00:10:07,105
I've done the same thing on the other side
and when we pull the strings.

167
00:10:07,939 --> 00:10:10,842
Well, I think you can see where we're going
with this.

168
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:16,781
We just finished packing in our plumage
here.

169
00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:21,352
I take the ends of the pole cords and attach
them to our noisemakers.

170
00:10:26,925 --> 00:10:32,196
Now I'm out walking through the woods and I
come across a bear or a wolf or helmet, and I

171
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:33,398
just do what the peacock vest?

172
00:10:37,802 --> 00:10:40,672
Now that doesn't get you to the House
safely, I don't know what will.

173
00:10:41,572 --> 00:10:43,474
I remember the women don't find you
handsome.

174
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:45,743
They should at least find your handy.

175
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:53,318
Lose my marbles here. Oh, God.

176
00:10:53,451 --> 00:11:01,859
Chuck. So.

177
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:12,870
It is winter the bear sleeps not alone like
me, but with many other bears in some dark

178
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,340
den, I bet that doesn't smell too great.

179
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,386
All right. Back to the drawing board.

180
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:32,957
I know all the security guard now he wants
somebody else to go out there and shoot the

181
00:11:32,957 --> 00:11:35,660
bear, but that's illegal unless the bear is
a danger.

182
00:11:35,693 --> 00:11:39,697
And actually, with the large members being
all kind of trapped inside here and not being

183
00:11:39,697 --> 00:11:40,798
allowed to go on the lake or on the
highways.

184
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:43,468
The danger level is is a way down.

185
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:48,406
So then Noel says that maybe helmets should
go out and argue with it because they've run

186
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:53,644
helmet. Just under that helmet wants us all
to dig a big tunnel like they did in that

187
00:11:53,644 --> 00:11:54,745
movie, The Great Escape.

188
00:11:55,213 --> 00:11:59,684
Then there was a big argument about who was
going to be Steve McQueen and Bruce Thompson

189
00:11:59,684 --> 00:12:02,320
out there. Trying to last through the
barrier ended up being trapped up in the Pine

190
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,787
Tree.

191
00:12:03,387 --> 00:12:06,357
You know, Uncle Brad, actually, you know,
bears aren't that dangerous.

192
00:12:06,457 --> 00:12:09,760
I saw a movie downtown the other day and
there was like these two brown bears and

193
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,329
they're roaming around a national park.

194
00:12:11,362 --> 00:12:13,364
They didn't maul anybody or nothing.

195
00:12:13,397 --> 00:12:16,667
Actually, you know, they were more afraid of
the people than the people were of them.

196
00:12:17,168 --> 00:12:18,202
And did they shoot the bears?

197
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:18,869
Oh, no,

198
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:23,708
No, no. See, no, just ranger, Smith told Yogi
and Boo Boo to put back those picnic baskets.

199
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,044
Oh, there you go, Harold, huh?

200
00:12:27,144 --> 00:12:31,248
Huh, huh? But our bear isn't hungry, OK,
he's smelling Musk out there.

201
00:12:31,248 --> 00:12:33,451
He's not going to be satisfied with dinner
and a dance.

202
00:12:33,751 --> 00:12:34,118
Oh, you

203
00:12:34,118 --> 00:12:36,754
Want, he wants a lady friend.

204
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:40,758
Well, we all want lady friends, Harold, but
we don't go around drooling and rubbing our

205
00:12:40,758 --> 00:12:41,892
rumps up against the tree.

206
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:45,496
No, even I know that one won't work.

207
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,600
Well, you know it might, but it's not the
type of girls your parents would approve of.

208
00:12:50,868 --> 00:12:55,239
No, right. So anyway, Helmut says that the
bear is so desperate for a mate that what we

209
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:59,076
can do is duct tape together, a couple of
air mattresses provide them with some fun for

210
00:12:59,076 --> 00:13:02,480
a seat covers and then douse the whole thing
with Musk and throw her out there.

211
00:13:02,513 --> 00:13:05,049
That might buy us enough time we can make a
break from my van.

212
00:13:05,216 --> 00:13:08,219
In the meantime, I'll take us to the next
segment and they'll give us just enough time

213
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:10,254
that I can think of a brilliant plan.

214
00:13:11,155 --> 00:13:12,590
This must be a really long segment.

215
00:13:20,664 --> 00:13:22,633
I'll go into the storeroom and get the stuff.

216
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:25,269
I'm just going to cost a large this

217
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:26,971
15 dollars, so good.

218
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:29,640
I'll give you a 20 if you take a check.

219
00:13:30,975 --> 00:13:34,445
Sounds good. Here's the tranquilizer, and
here's the bear repellent.

220
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:43,921
Let's go. Got a real big project for you this
week on Adventures with Bill.

221
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:45,589
You can see those little sticks in there.

222
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:48,425
What he's doing is he's actually going to
show you a little model of what it is that he

223
00:13:48,492 --> 00:13:49,527
that he wants us to build.

224
00:13:50,895 --> 00:13:55,533
She is going to build a little shelter, you
know, horizontal branch, and that's a little

225
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:57,134
one of those little dolls.

226
00:13:57,134 --> 00:13:58,469
I didn't even ask about that.

227
00:13:58,469 --> 00:14:02,940
It's none of my business, but I try and
build the full size model of that, not

228
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,008
including the doll first.

229
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:07,545
And so what we need is to get the chainsaw
going.

230
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:09,780
We got to cut out vertical horizontal branch
for.

231
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:20,691
Hmm. Oh, well, so what we're going to do is
instead of cutting it, we'll just use an axe

232
00:14:20,691 --> 00:14:27,064
and just chopped, you know, those tools are
strong little trees compared to, say, an axe.

233
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,834
So what do we do now, bill?

234
00:14:31,368 --> 00:14:32,670
Just Oh all right.

235
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:37,007
All right, pull it down. But you know, the
street of this tree, as I was agreeing a lot

236
00:14:37,007 --> 00:14:37,941
of spring and a lot

237
00:14:37,941 --> 00:14:39,443
Of it's amazing the power.

238
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:43,314
Oh, oh, oh.

239
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:49,086
Way up, there is a 70, 80 feet up there, and
you OK, well, you OK?

240
00:14:49,486 --> 00:14:50,821
Yeah, yeah. All right.

241
00:14:50,854 --> 00:14:53,791
All right. I figured if I shake the tree,
that'll help a little bit.

242
00:14:54,591 --> 00:14:58,996
Whoa. He didn't seem to be enjoying that, do
you imagine?

243
00:14:59,263 --> 00:15:01,265
Well, I thought I didn't, I didn't not.

244
00:15:01,598 --> 00:15:02,699
Oh, sorry about that.

245
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:10,240
Well, I got him down, you know, and he's OK.

246
00:15:10,874 --> 00:15:14,878
And of course, the good thing is now we have
enough branches to make our shelter.

247
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:25,989
So we picked these up and picked these up
and go over there and find just a fact that

248
00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:29,059
we just found that thing just lying there,
that was I wish we hadn't noticed that.

249
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:32,963
Well, what the heck? And we lean the and
lean the branches up against it.

250
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:39,303
I just like the model. And then what Bill
wanted to do here was some way of securing

251
00:15:39,436 --> 00:15:40,504
the branches right on there.

252
00:15:40,504 --> 00:15:44,408
And this is when you know a lot of your
training with the with the Cub Scouts or what

253
00:15:44,408 --> 00:15:49,546
have you, or maybe you did some sailing with
Captain Highline or whatever it was you can

254
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,450
you learn how to tie some really interesting
knots because you've got you've got trees and

255
00:15:53,450 --> 00:16:00,190
branches coming at a whole lot of bills tied
one limb to many on.

256
00:16:01,024 --> 00:16:04,895
Anyway, we got it all done, and by golly,
she's looking good and put the for sale sign

257
00:16:04,895 --> 00:16:08,098
up and everything. So Bill goes inside and
got the gate on it.

258
00:16:08,131 --> 00:16:10,167
What? But look, I feel like I.

259
00:16:11,168 --> 00:16:12,169
Oh gosh, oh boy.

260
00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:13,337
Oh boy, oh boy.

261
00:16:16,974 --> 00:16:22,746
Well, no place like home, how's school going
this year, Harold?

262
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:24,281
Oh, great. Excellent.

263
00:16:24,314 --> 00:16:25,649
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

264
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:27,417
Best year ever. Oh yeah, yeah.

265
00:16:27,684 --> 00:16:28,919
Football teams even winning.

266
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:29,386
Sure.

267
00:16:29,853 --> 00:16:32,155
Oh great. Sounds like you're doing pretty
well, honey me.

268
00:16:32,522 --> 00:16:34,925
Oh no, me, I'm. I'm just barely getting by.

269
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:38,328
School's doing good, though. I thought you
were asking about the school schools doing

270
00:16:38,328 --> 00:16:39,963
good. I'm just, you know, struggling by.

271
00:16:39,963 --> 00:16:40,630
As always,

272
00:16:41,898 --> 00:16:44,901
I would think you'd be real good in school,
you know, because you got the glasses and

273
00:16:45,135 --> 00:16:46,903
real gomer at sports and stuff, you know?

274
00:16:47,037 --> 00:16:51,508
Yeah, I know you'd figure, you know,
computers in geography.

275
00:16:51,641 --> 00:16:53,076
It's my television class.

276
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,345
You know, we're supposed to make a TV show.

277
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:59,116
Right. So we each got a hundred dollar
budget, so I made an episode of the Red Green

278
00:16:59,116 --> 00:17:00,584
Show. Remember that extra one we made last
fall?

279
00:17:01,351 --> 00:17:01,752
That one?

280
00:17:02,853 --> 00:17:04,688
Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, how'd you do on that
anyway?

281
00:17:05,188 --> 00:17:05,489
Got it.

282
00:17:05,489 --> 00:17:07,791
D I d teach you.

283
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,659
I know where I spend the other 90 dollars.

284
00:17:09,926 --> 00:17:10,861
And where did you spend it?

285
00:17:10,894 --> 00:17:12,929
I got this really cool computer game vortex.

286
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:14,397
So cool. So cool.

287
00:17:25,175 --> 00:17:28,912
Ok, I'm ready. How are you going to stop a
bear with that?

288
00:17:29,012 --> 00:17:31,114
I stick it down his throat, then open it.

289
00:17:31,181 --> 00:17:33,250
Oh yeah, the bears laughing at that.

290
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,784
We can all go to the bathroom, right?

291
00:17:34,951 --> 00:17:36,653
Just don't open up here. It's bad luck.

292
00:17:36,686 --> 00:17:39,256
Well, please hurry. We're going to have even
more bad luck.

293
00:17:39,689 --> 00:17:40,090
Yeah, that's

294
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,525
Right. Nature's calling.

295
00:17:41,758 --> 00:17:42,959
Who's ready to answer?

296
00:17:43,026 --> 00:17:45,428
Hey. Ok, let's go.

297
00:17:45,562 --> 00:17:46,596
Whoa. Whoa, whoa. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

298
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,299
Red. I'm head of security.

299
00:17:49,499 --> 00:17:50,634
I should say, Let's go.

300
00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:54,537
Ok, let's go. Wait, wait, wait.

301
00:17:54,537 --> 00:17:55,839
I forgot something.

302
00:17:56,106 --> 00:17:57,440
Oh, where's he going?

303
00:17:57,474 --> 00:17:59,209
He said he forgot something.

304
00:17:59,242 --> 00:18:00,644
You guys don't listen.

305
00:18:00,677 --> 00:18:01,711
Reading material.

306
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:07,684
Oh! They all remember guys, animals can
smell fear.

307
00:18:07,784 --> 00:18:09,452
All right. Yeah, they're not the only one.

308
00:18:10,453 --> 00:18:12,989
Ok, when we get there, alphabetical order.

309
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:14,891
Ok, good, good. My name's Albert.

310
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:19,329
And Brown.

311
00:18:47,757 --> 00:18:51,995
Well, the can of bear repellent was a big
disappointment, Dwayne pointed at the wrong

312
00:18:51,995 --> 00:18:54,497
way and sprayed himself in the face drop the
can the bear ate it.

313
00:18:55,432 --> 00:19:00,336
At least now, the bear won't eat Dwayne's
face, although I might try to tranquilizer

314
00:19:00,336 --> 00:19:01,371
gun, but our aim was off.

315
00:19:01,404 --> 00:19:03,306
We ended up hitting Moose Thompson at the
Pine Tree.

316
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,609
Uncle Ray, how long does it take for the
tranquilizer to take effect?

317
00:19:07,177 --> 00:19:10,380
Just a little bit longer than it takes a bear
to maul a person from head to toe.

318
00:19:11,181 --> 00:19:13,817
Is that just a gas uncle red, or is that what
it says in the instructions?

319
00:19:15,218 --> 00:19:16,886
We can't go on like this much longer.

320
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,422
I mean, the washroom situation is getting
brutal around here.

321
00:19:19,689 --> 00:19:22,325
A lot of the guys have been taking potted
plants up to their room.

322
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,661
Somebody's going have to show a little
bravery

323
00:19:25,528 --> 00:19:26,563
Or stupidity

324
00:19:27,463 --> 00:19:31,868
That you volunteering. Boy, that there really
isn't he?

325
00:19:32,335 --> 00:19:33,069
No, no, no.

326
00:19:33,136 --> 00:19:34,571
That's the sound of the wild possum.

327
00:19:34,604 --> 00:19:35,972
The lodge meetings are about to begin.

328
00:19:36,606 --> 00:19:40,777
Oh wow. We'll just see who is the lucky lodge
member who gets to sedate Winnie the Pooh.

329
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:43,479
I'm sure. Glad I'm not a lodge member.

330
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:44,981
Aren't we all?

331
00:19:46,015 --> 00:19:47,850
Well, they say that a hero is just a
sandwich.

332
00:19:49,152 --> 00:19:50,787
Let's go see who gets to hold the pickle.

333
00:19:52,889 --> 00:19:55,458
We are.

334
00:19:59,629 --> 00:20:06,536
My great, great, great.

335
00:20:06,936 --> 00:20:07,904
All rise.

336
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:22,985
He is down the floor, recognize his helmet,
winter garden.

337
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:26,923
I would like to know why Noel hasn't done
anything about the barrier.

338
00:20:26,956 --> 00:20:28,057
Yeah, why not?

339
00:20:28,991 --> 00:20:31,160
Yes. Well, I'm not in charge of pest
control.

340
00:20:31,928 --> 00:20:33,296
My job is to prevent theft.

341
00:20:33,696 --> 00:20:35,131
Good point. Yeah, yeah.

342
00:20:35,164 --> 00:20:37,734
Well, if you ask me, the bear stolen your
courage and.

343
00:20:38,735 --> 00:20:40,803
Oh yeah, why don't you go out and talk to
him?

344
00:20:41,003 --> 00:20:42,338
You might find out that your uncle or
something.

345
00:20:43,873 --> 00:20:45,308
Hold on. Hold on.

346
00:20:45,308 --> 00:20:49,178
Look, it's a well known fact that bears are
only in heat for two weeks.

347
00:20:49,178 --> 00:20:50,813
I think we can hold out that long.

348
00:20:51,013 --> 00:20:53,449
Hey, take yourself there, Murray, right?

349
00:20:54,317 --> 00:20:57,854
Question question, what what does it mean?

350
00:20:59,322 --> 00:21:08,464
Right? Well, herald and heat means the bear
has more than Georgia on its mind to get

351
00:21:08,464 --> 00:21:09,999
that. Not a clue, right?

352
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:14,937
Animals only get in the mood to mate for a
short period of time once a year.

353
00:21:15,338 --> 00:21:17,773
Oh boy, that'd make it easy, wouldn't it?

354
00:21:17,974 --> 00:21:19,775
Boy, one more time for Nintendo.

355
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:20,276
Right?

356
00:21:21,143 --> 00:21:22,778
Huh. What?

357
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:26,616
Shut up, Harold, anyway. I think we all
agree that it's up to North Hell to do

358
00:21:26,616 --> 00:21:28,150
something about the bear, right? Yeah.

359
00:21:28,551 --> 00:21:31,053
Yeah, yeah. Why don't we put it to a vote?

360
00:21:31,087 --> 00:21:31,988
No or help?

361
00:21:32,221 --> 00:21:33,756
Sure. Excuse me.

362
00:21:34,056 --> 00:21:39,128
Read, since you're the lodge leader, I think
maybe we should do something about the bear.

363
00:21:39,629 --> 00:21:40,763
Ok, sure, somebody.

364
00:21:40,897 --> 00:21:40,997
Sure.

365
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,199
Yeah. Well, I am doing something about it.

366
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:46,168
All those in favor of Noel taking care of
the bear.

367
00:21:46,202 --> 00:21:47,737
Say I.

368
00:21:49,238 --> 00:21:50,539
All those in favor of helmet.

369
00:21:50,573 --> 00:21:52,575
Taking care of the bear. Say I.

370
00:21:53,376 --> 00:21:55,077
Well, there you go there, don't you?

371
00:21:56,612 --> 00:21:58,047
It's a tie. Great.

372
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,281
You know what we're going to do, Uncle
Uncle.

373
00:22:00,016 --> 00:22:01,484
We'll have to make the deciding vote.

374
00:22:05,554 --> 00:22:07,990
Well, I'm going to need some time to think
this over, so.

375
00:22:08,424 --> 00:22:12,962
So while I'm deciding why don't we get
Murray and Dwayne to come up here and give us

376
00:22:12,962 --> 00:22:13,963
the evening's entertainment?

377
00:22:16,732 --> 00:22:19,568
Well, what we're going to do for you this
week, boys, we're going to tell you the story

378
00:22:19,568 --> 00:22:21,637
of Goldilocks and the three bears.

379
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,104
All right.

380
00:22:22,671 --> 00:22:27,510
Oh, it's funny how one scruffy bear who is
looking for love in all the wrong places and

381
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,677
disrupt so many lives.

382
00:22:29,812 --> 00:22:34,049
What's that? Well, love exciting and new.

383
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:35,518
Come aboard. We're expecting you.

384
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:38,287
Same as our bear. It's not himself, lady
friend.

385
00:22:39,688 --> 00:22:42,124
I think we're going to be able to go back
outside again real soon.

386
00:22:42,525 --> 00:22:47,296
Anyway, if my wife is watching, I should be
able to get to my van and come home in about

387
00:22:48,697 --> 00:22:49,965
two minutes. Just a guess.

388
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,868
Maybe you can check to see if you can find
our bearskin rug.

389
00:22:54,036 --> 00:22:58,407
So until next time, on behalf of myself and
Harold and the whole gang up here at Possum

390
00:22:58,407 --> 00:23:00,810
Lodge and the Bear and his lady friend.

391
00:23:01,343 --> 00:23:02,311
Keep your stick on the ice.

392
00:23:05,147 --> 00:23:08,784
Yes. We are not doing the bare stuff yet.

393
00:23:08,817 --> 00:23:10,586
Goldilocks or Goldie, I want to be the bear.

394
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:12,688
I know you want to be the bear, but you'll
be the bear later.

395
00:23:13,122 --> 00:23:15,724
All right, we'll turn it around, OK?

396
00:23:15,758 --> 00:23:20,563
The bear is in the forest, and tiger comes
up until this golden lock family's house.

397
00:23:20,563 --> 00:23:23,966
Ok? So anyway, goes up to the door and
knocks on the door.

398
00:23:24,266 --> 00:23:27,136
Wait, let me to talk about it.

399
00:23:27,236 --> 00:23:30,606
It's a fairy tale and bears can do anything
but go outside.

400
00:23:30,639 --> 00:23:32,508
Oh, come here. The bears can be Goldilocks.

401
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:34,310
Well, you want to be the bear.

402
00:23:34,343 --> 00:23:35,844
He's an idiot and he wants to be the bear.

403
00:23:35,878 --> 00:23:36,345
That's the way.

404
00:23:36,879 --> 00:23:38,547
There's a friend of yours waiting outside.

405
00:23:39,081 --> 00:23:40,783
Very attractive. There you go.

406
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:45,821
And that's the way

407
00:23:46,822 --> 00:23:48,924
That we live.

408
00:23:49,258 --> 00:23:50,459
Can I have his job in the store?

409
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:51,994
Most definitely you can't.

410
00:23:51,994 --> 00:23:53,629
Yes, I have one of the pups.
