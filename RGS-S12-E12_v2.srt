1
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:03,870
I LIKE HAVING
A LARGE VEHICLE.

2
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:05,772
IT MAKES ME FEEL SAFER.

3
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:07,340
I LIKE SITTING UP
NICE AND HIGH

4
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,509
SO I CAN SEE
THE COPS SOONER.

5
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:11,978
THE PROBLEM WITH ANY OF THESE
VANS OR S.U.V.s OR WHATEVER

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,314
IS WHEN YOU GO AROUND
A CORNER THEY ROLL OVER.

7
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,649
I FIND THAT INCONVENIENT.

8
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,485
THAT'S BECAUSE
THEY'RE TOP HEAVY --

9
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,153
BUT THEN, SO AM I.

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,422
SO I ATTACHED
THIS LANDING GEAR,

11
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:24,724
FROM THIS OLD AIRPLANE
I FOUND SOMEWHERE --

12
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,226
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT REALLY.

13
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:28,194
AND NOW, WHENEVER I TAKE
A CORNER TOO FAST,

14
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:32,165
THE LANDING GEAR IS GOING
TO STOP ME FROM BECOMING
AIRBORNE, SEE?

15
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,134
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY,

16
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:37,404
ACTIONS SPEAK
LOUDER THAN WORDS.

17
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:39,739
AND I KNOW A LOT OF YOU
DON'T HEAR TOO WELL.

18
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:55,388
[cheers and applause]

19
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,367
THANKS VERY MUCH.

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,868
APPRECIATE IT.

21
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:14,774
IT'S BEEN A STRANGE WEEK UP
AT THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

22
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,277
LLOYD CARSON PASSED AWAY.

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,847
YEAH, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH
THE SAME WAY WE FEEL.

24
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,649
LLOYD WAS A WEIRD GUY.

25
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:24,084
HE WAS ONE OF
THOSE MILITARY NUTS,

26
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,919
ALWAYS DRESSED FOR
COMBAT, YOU KNOW.

27
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:29,089
HE WAS MARRIED FOUR TIMES.
MAYBE THAT EXPLAINS IT.

28
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:31,091
I ALWAYS GOT ALONG
OKAY WITH LLOYD,

29
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:33,726
AS LONG AS HE'D
TAKEN HIS MEDICATION.

30
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,662
THIS ACTUALLY
WAS LLOYD'S MUSKET,

31
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,063
BUT IT'S OURS NOW.

32
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,665
SEE, BECAUSE THE BANK HAS
SEIZED HIS PROPERTY

33
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,200
BECAUSE OF DEBTS
BEING OWED THERE,

34
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,001
BUT THEY SAID ANY LODGE
MEMBER CAN GO OVER

35
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:43,837
AND TAKE ANY PIECE
OF JUNK THEY WANT, EH --

36
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,338
AS LONG AS THEY GET
IT OFF THE PROPERTY.

37
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:46,840
IT'S FANTASTIC.

38
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,741
UNCLE RED!
UNCLE RED!

39
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:51,711
OH -- DID YOU
STEAL THAT MUSKET
FROM A DEAD GUY?

40
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:56,382
SHAME ON YOU.
SHAME ON YOU.

41
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:01,154
HAROLD, IT'S NOT STEALING
WHEN THE BANK DOES IT.

42
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:04,457
IT'S CALLED MEETING YOUR
FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES.

43
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:06,459
OH-HO!

44
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,761
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE
MEANING OF THAT WORD.

45
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:12,265
NO, RESPONSIBILITY.
FIDUCIARY?

46
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,067
AND FIDUCIARY.

47
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,702
HAROLD,
ALL I KNOW IS

48
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,537
THE BANK JUST WANTS THE
HOUSE AND THE LAND,

49
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,572
AND THEY TOLD US WE CAN
HAVE ANYTHING ELSE WE FIND,

50
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,175
AS LONG AS WE REMOVE IT
FROM THE PROPERTY.

51
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,644
I STILL THINK
IT'S WRONG.

52
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,646
LLOYD WAS
A WEIRD GUY.

53
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,982
YOU COULD FIND ALL
SORTS OF DANGEROUS
STUFF OVER THERE.

54
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,683
YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU
SHOULD COME OVER,

55
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,152
KIND OF PICK AROUND.

56
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,786
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO
FIND YOURSELF A LIFE.

57
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,890
RED! WE GOT BIG TROUBLE
OVER AT THE CARSON PLACE.

58
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:38,591
WHAT?

59
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,593
WELL, THE WATER TASTED FUNNY,
SO WE SHONE A LIGHT
DOWN THE WELL,

60
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,396
AND YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT
WE SAW WHEN WE LOOKED
DOWN THERE.

61
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,832
STINKY PETERSON?

62
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,700
NO. A MISSILE.

63
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,335
A MISSILE, RED,
WHAT?

64
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,404
POINTING STRAIGHT
UP AT US.

65
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,907
OH, NO!
OH, NO!

66
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:56,643
WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE
AND I'VE NEVER BEEN
WITH A WOMAN!

67
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,356
GO AHEAD. 
GO AHEAD.
 

68
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,091
THERE'S NOTHING TO
WORRY ABOUT, HAROLD.

69
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:13,593
THERE'S NOTHING
DANGEROUS GOING ON.

70
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:14,961
THE MISSILE'S NOT
ANY PROBLEM AT ALL.

71
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,362
WE'LL JUST HOIST HER
OUT OF THERE, NO SWEAT.

72
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,631
RED, IT'S A MISSILE.

73
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,800
WELL, SO WHAT?
THOSE DON'T JUST GO OFF.

74
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,314
AND NOW IT'S TIME TO PLAY
THE POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME.

75
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,785
[cheers and applause]

76
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,024
TODAY'S WINNER WILL
RECEIVE A COUPON

77
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,628
FOR THREE TANNING SESSIONS
AT THE PORT ASBESTOS
LEATHER FACTORY.

78
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:51,764
OKAY, COVER YOUR EARS.

79
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,399
RED, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS

80
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,268
TO GET RANGER GORD
TO SAY THIS WORD...

81
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,439
ALL RIGHT, ED.

82
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:00,707
AND... GO.

83
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,141
OKAY, GORD.

84
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,110
THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT'S VERY HOT.

85
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,279
CONNIE STEVENS.

86
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,182
OKAY, OKAY, THERE'S
AN EXPRESSION,

87
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,683
WHERE THERE'S SMOKE
THERE'S...

88
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,820
CHEECH AND CHONG.

89
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,522
NO. OKAY, OKAY, WHEN
YOU WERE IN YOUR TOWER

90
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,025
AND LIGHTNING HIT YOUR
FOREST, WHAT DID YOU GET?

91
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,327
CRISPY NOSE HAIRS?

92
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,596
OKAY. NO.

93
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,966
THIS IS THE ONE THING
THAT'S DESTROYING ALL
OF OUR FORESTS.

94
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,968
YEAH. TOO MUCH URINE.

95
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,338
ALMOST OUT OF TIME, RED.

96
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,673
YEAH. OKAY.

97
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,375
OKAY, GORD, REMEMBER
HOW THAT FOREST

98
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,776
BURNT TO THE GROUND
OUTSIDE ROCK CREEK POINT?

99
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,311
WHAT HAPPENED THERE?

100
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:42,582
YEAH, RIGHT, THE FOREST
RANGER FELL ASLEEP...

101
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,717
FOR A MONTH.

102
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,619
YOU KNOW,
FOR A WHILE THERE,

103
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,521
I THOUGHT THEY WERE
GOING TO FIRE HIM.

104
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:51,224
HEY! THERE WE GO!

105
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:55,828
[quirky upbeat music]

106
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,035
Winston:
I'M A LITTLE HUNGRY.

107
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:05,571
Red:
WELL, THERE'S SOME SANDWICHES
IN THE COOLER THERE, WINSTON.

108
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,647
Winston:
UH, THIS SMELLS
A LITTLE WEIRD.

109
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,282
HOW OLD IS THIS?

110
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,784
Red:
I'M NOT SURE.

111
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,286
WHEN'S THE LAST
TIME WE WENT FISHING?

112
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,829
Mike:
HEY, WHAT'S THE WORST
FOOD YOU GUYS EVER ATE?

113
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:33,066
Red:
VEGETABLES.

114
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,901
Winston:
NO OFFENCE, MIKE,

115
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,136
BUT FOR ME IT HAD TO BE
YOUR MACARONI SURPRISE.

116
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:39,205
Mike: REALLY?
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED IT.

117
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,174
Red:
SURPRISE.

118
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,410
Mike:
THAT'S NOTHING.

119
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,779
YOU GUYS EVER
HAD PRISON FOOD?

120
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,815
Red and Winston:
NO. UH-HUNH.

121
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,917
Mike:
WELL, IT IS DISGUSTING.

122
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,653
AND SUCH TINY PORTIONS.

123
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,255
Red:
WHAT'S THE WORST THING
YOU EVER ATE, MIKE?

124
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,624
Mike:
EVIDENCE.

125
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:04,664
Winston:
I ATE GRUBS ONCE.

126
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:08,334
Mike:
WHY WOULD ANYONE EAT GRUBS?

127
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:11,337
Red: MAYBE THEY
WERE OUT OF CRICKETS.

128
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,439
Winston:
HEY, LOOK, WHEN YOU'RE
LOST IN THE WOODS FOR DAYS

129
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,041
AND YOU HAVEN'T EATEN,

130
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,910
GRUBS START TO LOOK
PRETTY DARN GOOD.

131
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:20,246
Mike:
OH, OKAY, WELL,
THAT'S JUST HUMAN NATURE.

132
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,281
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF

133
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,717
UNTIL YOU'RE IN A
DESPERATE SITUATION.

134
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,120
LIKE MANY TIMES
I WAS FORCED TO STEAL

135
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,822
SIMPLY BECAUSE PEOPLE
WOULDN'T GIVE ME THEIR STUFF.

136
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,393
Winston:
WE ALL MAKE CHOICES, YOU KNOW?

137
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,794
Red:
YUP, THAT WE DO.

138
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:37,830
Winston: ANTHONY ANTHONY SAYS
THE QUALITY OF YOUR CHOICES

139
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,134
IS BASED ON THE CALIBRE
OF YOUR ALTERNATIVES.

140
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,536
Red:
WELL, YEAH, THAT'S WHY
THE SELL A LOT MORE LADAs

141
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,072
IN RUSSIA
THAN THEY DO HERE.

142
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,641
Mike: IT'S SUPPLY
AND DEMAND, REALLY.

143
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,410
LIKE, WHEN YOU'RE
IN PRISON,

144
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,211
THE WOMEN START
LOOKING BETTER.

145
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,414
Red:
SO DO THE MEN, I HEAR.

146
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,183
Winston:
BERNICE MARRIED YOU.

147
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,354
I MEAN, SHE MUST HAVE HAD
SOME PRETTY SLIM PICKINGS.

148
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:06,692
Red:
YEAH, IT WAS EITHER
ME OR ONE OF YOU GUYS.

149
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,632
DID YOU KNOW IT TOOK
ISAAC NEWTON OVER 20 YEARS

150
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,267
TO DISCOVER GRAVITY?

151
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,702
THAT'S BECAUSE HE
JUST SAT AROUND THINKING.

152
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,571
IF HE WAS AN
ACTIVE HANDYMAN,

153
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,973
HE WOULD HAVE HIT ON
GRAVITY A LOT SOONER,

154
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,810
ESPECIALLY IF HE HAD ONE OF
THESE EXTENSION LADDERS.

155
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:26,846
I TELL YOU, AN EXTENSION
LADDER IS A DANGEROUS THING.

156
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,748
IT'S LIKE A FAT GUY
WITH TINY FEET.

157
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:31,250
IT CAN TIP OVER ABOUT
A MILLION DIFFERENT WAYS.

158
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:35,621
SO THIS TIME ON
HANDYMAN CORNER,

159
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,191
WE'RE GOING TO BUILD SOMETHING
A LOT SAFER THAN A LADDER.

160
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:40,993
THAT'S RIGHT.
AN ESCALATOR.

161
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:44,330
OKAY, FOR STARTERS YOU
WANNA TAKE DOWN YOUR
CLOTHESLINE,

162
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,798
BECAUSE THAT'S
GOING TO BECOME

163
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:48,034
PART OF THE DRIVE
MECHANISM FOR THE UNIT.

164
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,069
BUT YOU'RE ALSO GOING
TO NEED A MOTOR.

165
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,737
SO TO SAVE MONEY THERE,

166
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,407
I SUGGEST YOU TAKE THE MOTOR
OF AN EXISTING APPLIANCE,

167
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,776
LIKE, SAY,
MAYBE A WASHING MACHINE.

168
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,011
I MEAN, YOU ALREADY TOOK
DOWN YOUR CLOTHESLINE.

169
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,280
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE
DOING ANY LAUNDRY.

170
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:12,725
OKAY, I GOT MY DRIVE
UNIT ALL IN PLACE THERE.

171
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,795
AND WIRED HER UP WITH A
COUPLE OF 3-WAY SWITCHES

172
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:18,130
SO I CAN TURN IT ON AND OFF
FROM TWO DIFFERENT PLACES.

173
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,266
YOU KNOW, LIKE THOSE SWITCHES
YOU HAVE IN YOUR HOUSE

174
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,034
FOR WHEN YOUR WIFE
FORGETS YOU'RE STILL HOME

175
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,437
AND TURNS OFF THE BASEMENT
LIGHT WHILE YOU'RE DOWN THERE

176
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,373
TRYING TO GET A SLIVER
OUT OF YOUR UPPER THIGH.

177
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,208
SO I CAN TURN
MY ESCALATOR ON

178
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,178
BY PUSHING THE
SWITCH DOWN HERE

179
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,815
AND THEN TURN IT OFF
FROM THE TOP OF THE LADDER.

180
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,184
I'LL TELL YOU WHY
THAT'S IMPORTANT LATER.

181
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,654
OKAY, NOW WE GET
TO THE TRICKY PART...

182
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:42,989
THE COLLAPSIBLE STEPS.

183
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:44,991
I'M GOING TO USE
FOLDING CHAIRS ON THAT.

184
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,026
BUT HERE, AGAIN, YOU DON'T
WANT TO GO OVER BUDGET.

185
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,729
SO GO TO THE MOST UNPOPULAR
CLUB IN YOUR TOWN --

186
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,498
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING LIKE
CITIZENS AGAINST BEER.

187
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,134
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE WAY
MORE FOLDING CHAIRS
THAN THEY NEED,

188
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,570
AND YOU CAN HELP THEM
OUT WITH THAT PROBLEM.

189
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,305
OKAY, BUT ALL
I NEED IS THE BACK

190
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:00,907
AND THE FOLDING SEAT THERE,

191
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,375
SO I'M JUST GOING TO
TAKE A COUPLE OF MINUTES

192
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,410
AND HACK THE
LEGS OFF THERE.

193
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,201
OKAY, I'VE GOT
MY LEGLESS CHAIRS

194
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,203
ATTACHED TO THE
CLOTHESLINE LIFT SYSTEM,

195
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,540
AND WHAT I WANTED TO SHOW YOU
I ENDED USING THOSE SKIS
THAT YOU SAW EARLIER.

196
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,609
I TURNED THEM UPSIDE DOWN

197
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,744
SO THE CHAIRS DON'T
CATCH ON THE RUNGS,

198
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,314
BECAUSE DOING A
HANDYMAN PROJECT IS
LIKE MAKING WIENERS...

199
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,449
YOU END UP
USING EVERYTHING.

200
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,651
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GIVE
HER A DRY RUN.

201
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,524
OKAY, WE'RE ALMOST DONE,

202
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,359
BUT I BETTER PICK UP
THE PACE A LITTLE BIT

203
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,927
BECAUSE I WANT
TO FINISH THIS PROJECT

204
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,662
BEFORE MY MEDICAL
INSURANCE RUNS OUT.

205
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,968
OKAY, JUST HAD TO ADD
THE HANDRAIL ON THERE,

206
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:03,369
AND WE'RE READY TO GO.

207
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:04,870
AGAIN I SAVED MYSELF
A FEW DOLLARS HERE.

208
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,706
THIS IS JUST A
GARDEN HOSE THAT I SPLIT

209
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,841
AND THEN FIT IT OVER THE
EDGE OF THE PLYWOOD.

210
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,476
THE HOSE DIDN'T
COST ME ANYTHING

211
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,445
BECAUSE MY
NEIGHBOURS ARE AWAY.

212
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,914
ACTUALLY, EVEN THE PLYWOOD
WASN'T THAT HARD TO COME BY.

213
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,551
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH TALK.

214
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,420
TIME FOR A LITTLE
UPWARD MOBILITY.

215
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:25,658
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

216
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,194
THEY SHOULD, AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

217
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,221
[quirky upbeat music]

218
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,158
YOU KNOW, WHEN A MAN
GETS TO A CERTAIN AGE,

219
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,160
HE'S LEARNED A
THING OR TWO.

220
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,162
I DON'T MEAN THAT
FIGURATIVELY EITHER.

221
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:07,800
I'M SAYING MAYBE
ONE, TWO THINGS TOPS.

222
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,802
NOW, SOME OF
YOU GUYS MAY THINK

223
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,804
YOU KNOW MORE THAN I'M
GIVING YOU CREDIT FOR,

224
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,973
BUT YOU'RE JUST MISTAKING
USELESS TRIVIA

225
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,308
FOR ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE.

226
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,344
OH, SURE, I'M SURE YOU SIT
THERE IN YOUR LIVING ROOM

227
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,213
YELLING OUT THE ANSWERS TO
YOUR FAVOURITE TV GAME SHOW.

228
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,948
YOU MIGHT EVEN GET
SOME OF THEM RIGHT.

229
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,285
BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT APPLIED
WISDOM FOR YOUR GOLDEN YEARS

230
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:30,423
IN THE OFF CHANCE THAT YOU
ACTUALLY HAVE GOLDEN YEARS.

231
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:34,360
SEE, THE MIDDLE-AGED MIND IS
KIND OF LIKE A COMPUTER --

232
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:37,997
AN OLD COMPUTER,
LIKE MAYBE A COMMODORE 64.

233
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,965
AND YOU GOT PEANUT BUTTER
ON THE KEYS

234
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,401
AND SNEEZE MARKS ALL
OVER THE SCREEN.

235
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:45,604
NOW, IF YOU DON'T WANT THAT
COMPUTER TO BE DECLARED
OBSOLETE,

236
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,173
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
YOU GOT TO DO.

237
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,109
YOU GOT TO CLEAR
OFF SOME SPACE ON THE
OLD HARD DRIVE THERE.

238
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:51,444
THINGS LIKE
YOUR WIFE'S BIRTHDAY,

239
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,546
HEY, THAT'S A KEEPER.

240
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,848
BUT KNOWING WHO WROTE THE
THEME SONG TO
 McHALE'S NAVY,
 

241
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,150
WELL, THAT ONE CAN GO.

242
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,152
LIKEWISE, I'M SURE
THERE WAS A TIME

243
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,388
WHEN IT WAS IMPORTANT
TO KNOW WHO SCORED

244
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,824
THE WINNING TOUCHDOWN
IN THE 1976 SUPERBOWL,

245
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,158
HOW MANY YARDS HE RAN,

246
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,727
THAT FACT THAT HE
SLIPPED IN THE ENDZONE

247
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,528
BECAUSE IT WAS
RAINING THAT DAY.

248
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,397
BUT IF THAT STOPS YOU
FROM REMEMBERING

249
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,233
WHICH WIRES GO WHERE WHEN
YOU'RE JUMP STARTING A CAR,

250
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:19,605
OR THAT FLAMMABLE AND
INFLAMMABLE ACTUALLY
MEAN THE SAME THING,

251
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:23,342
WELL, YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT
GOING TO ENJOY ANY MORE
SUPERBOWLS.

252
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,045
SO WHAT I'M SAYING
IS LOSE THE TRIVIA,

253
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,713
KEEP THE KNOWLEDGE.

254
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,381
YOU MAY NEVER
BE ON
 JEOPARDY,
 

255
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,084
BUT YOU'LL
ALSO NEVER BE IN IT.

256
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,686
REMEMBER,
I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

257
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,154
WE'RE ALL IN
THIS TOGETHER.

258
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:43,262
WHEN THERE'S NO FOG IN TOWN
EXCEPT FOR YOUR PATCH,

259
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,998
WHEN IT GIVES
YOU AN ITCH WHERE
YOU'D RATHER NOT SCRATCH,

260
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,334
CALL ROTHSCHILD'S NOW,
AND I'LL BE DISPATCHED.

261
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,935
LIGHT UP THAT SWITCHBOARD,

262
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,771
JUST DON'T LIGHT A MATCH.

263
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,443
BRING THAT MANHOLE COVER,
WILL YOU, HAROLD?

264
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:01,213
OKAY, I THINK WE GOT THAT
MISSILE PROBLEM ALL
FIGURED OUT.

265
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,750
I THINK WE SHOULD CONTACT
THE U.S. AIR FORCE.

266
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,485
YOU KNOW,
FROM THE COLD WAR.

267
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,187
THIS COULD BE ONE
OF THEIR MISSILES.

268
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,356
WELL, I'M NOT GOING
TO BE CALLING THE
U.S. AIR FORCE.

269
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:11,824
WHAT DO I SAY?
WE'VE GOT A MISSILE?

270
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:15,194
THEY TAKE
THAT AS A THREAT,
WE'RE IN REAL TROUBLE.

271
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:18,230
WELL, THEN CONTACT
THE CANADIAN AIR FORCE.

272
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,133
HAROLD, IT'S AFTER SIX.
HE'S GONE HOME.

273
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,470
[applause]

274
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,706
YOU HAVE
TO CALL SOMEBODY.

275
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,074
CALL THE BOMB SQUAD.
CALL THE BOMB SQUAD.

276
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,509
JUST CALL
SOMEBODY, PLEASE.

277
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,211
JUST RELAX.

278
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,480
ARE YOU AFRAID THAT
WE DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT MISSILES?

279
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,783
I'M AFRAID YOU DON'T
KNOW MUCH ABOUT ANYTHING.

280
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,518
JUST BE REASONABLE.

281
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,220
WHAT'S THE WORSE THING
THAT COULD HAPPEN?

282
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,622
HMM.
OH, LET'S SEE.

283
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,391
OH! THE MISSILE GOES OFF
AND KILLS EVERYTHING

284
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:47,226
IN A 50-MILE RADIUS!

285
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,094
YOU DON'T THINK?
NO, NO, NO, NO.

286
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,832
NO, THE DANGER IS THE
MISSILE GOING OFF
UNEXPECTEDLY.

287
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,500
SO THE SOLUTION IS

288
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,602
WE GOT TO SET THE
MISSILE OFF ON PURPOSE.

289
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,413
YES.

290
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,181
I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.

291
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,783
WELL, AND YOU
SHOULD, SEE?

292
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,151
I FIGURE WE'RE GOING
TO SCREW THE MANHOLE COVER

293
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,986
DOWN ON TOP
OF THE WELL, OKAY.

294
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,589
THEN WE DETONATE THAT
PUPPY RIGHT DOWN
INSIDE THERE.

295
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:20,259
WE PUT THE FISH NET TO LAY
DOWN RIGHT ON TOP OF THAT
MANHOLE COVER THERE.

296
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,862
I FIGURE THE COVER'S
GOING TO ABSORB,

297
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:26,365
I'M GUESSING,
95% OF THE ENERGY.

298
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,434
SO THEN THE MISSILE
WILL GET ALL TANGLED
UP IN THE FISH NET

299
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,704
AND JUST FLOP DOWN
BESIDE THE WELL.

300
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,439
YEAH.

301
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:35,241
YUP. YUP.

302
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,476
AND YOU'RE SERIOUS?

303
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,144
DEAD SERIOUS.

304
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,013
LET'S HOPE NOT.

305
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,455
Red:
WALTER HAD ASKED ME TO 
JOIN HIM IN BEHIND THE LODGE 

306
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,624
TO DO A LITTLE 
BIT OF WORK ON HIS CAR.
 

307
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:54,026
AND ONE OF THE 
FIRST THINGS I DO WHEN 
WORKING ON A VEHICLE 

308
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,461
IS KIND OF CHECK THE OIL. 

309
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:58,264
AND HE HADN'T CHANGED 
HIS OIL IN A WHILE.
 

310
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,832
SO WE HAD A CASE OF OIL. 

311
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,533
I THOUGHT THIS MIGHT 
BE A GOOD WAY TO START.
 

312
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,135
SO I GIVE HIM THE WRENCH 
AND THE PAN THERE 

313
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,271
AND SAID GO DOWN UNDERNEATH. 

314
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:08,140
PUT A PIECE OF PLYWOOD DOWN 
THERE AND SO HE KEEPS HIS
 
CLOTHES A LITTLE CLEANER.

315
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:11,377
ALL HE'S GOT TO DO IS TAKE 
THE DRAIN PLUG OFF THE PAN
 

316
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:14,313
AND GET THE OLD OIL OUT, 
AND WE'LL PUT THE NEW OIL IN. 

317
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,316
I'M SURE IT'S THE FIRST TIME 
WALTER HAD EVER DONE THIS. 

318
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,118
IT'S KIND OF RUSTED ON THERE. 
BUT HE FINALLY GOT THE --
 

319
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:22,021
GET THE PAN. 
THE PAN, WALTER, THE PAN.
 

320
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,491
THERE YOU GO. 
ALL RIGHT.
 

321
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,960
SO WE GOT HER ALL FILLED UP 
AND HE WRINGS THAT OUT.
 

322
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:30,529
AND HE DIDN'T SPILL 
TOO MUCH OF IT REALLY. 

323
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,231
NOT TOO BAD. 

324
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,400
SO HE GETS UP AND --  

325
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:35,834
WHEN YOU'RE DOING 
YOUR OWN OIL CHANGES,
 

326
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:39,004
HERE'S AN IMPORTANT -- 
LOOK FOR THE DRAIN PLUG. 

327
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,406
A LOT OF TIMES 
IT'LL DROP RIGHT INTO THE. 

328
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,774
THERE IS IS THERE. 

329
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,242
SEE, IT'S IMPORTANT. 

330
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,543
YOU GO PUT THAT 
BACK ON, WALTER.
 

331
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:46,845
THAT GOES BACK ON. 
AWAY YOU GO.  

332
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:50,649
AND WE HAVE A BIG CAN 
WE KEEP FOR RECYCLED
 
OIL DOWN THERE.

333
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,518
SO I JUST GO DOWN AND 
DUMP THE PAN IN THERE,
 

334
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,620
AND, WELL, SHE GOT AWAY 
FROM ME A LITTLE BIT.
 

335
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,956
SO, OKAY. 
GOOD ENOUGH.  

336
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,691
NOW I'M STARTING 
TO PUT THE OIL --
 

337
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:01,026
I PUT A FEW QUARTS 
IN AT THIS POINT.
 

338
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,198
I FIGURE IT WAS -- 

339
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,800
YOU KNOW, 
FOR A SMALL ENGINE,
 

340
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,368
IT WAS REALLY 
HOLDING A LOT OF OIL.  

341
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,236
SO I THOUGHT MAYBE I'D JUST 
CHECK TO SEE HOW WE'RE DOING.
 

342
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,805
AND, UH, REAL SURPRISE. 

343
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,606
I PULL IT OUT, 
AND IT'S JUST BONE DRY.
 

344
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,709
AND, UH, I CAN 
HEAR OIL RUNNING.
 

345
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,477
IT'S RUNNING 
DOWN THE WOOD
 

346
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,280
AND RIGHT DOWN THE HILL. 

347
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:22,815
SO, YOU KNOW, 
I'M SAYING TO WALTER,
 

348
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,783
LIKE WHAT HAPPENED 
TO THAT DRAIN PLUG?
 

349
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,453
AND HE SAYS, NO PROBLEM. 
I GOT IT RIGHT HERE. 

350
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,188
I SAID, YOU GOTTA GO 
PUT THAT IN WALTER.
 

351
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,823
IT'S GOT TO GO 
INTO THE PAN.
 

352
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:34,026
BUT NOW EVERYTHING 
IS SO DARN SLIPPERY, 
THE GRASS, EVERYTHING, 

353
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:37,830
THAT IT JUST VIRTUALLY TAKES 
OFF ON HIM AND AWAY HE GOES.
 

354
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,801
AND I TRY TO -- 
I DID MY BEST TO SAVE HIM. 

355
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,737
OH, BOY. 

356
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,772
SO HE'S OKAY, BUT -- 

357
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,374
NOW, I'M LOOKING 
AT THE BOARD, 

358
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,409
AND SUDDENLY I 
GOT A GREAT IDEA.
 

359
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,044
HMM... YEAH... 

360
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,445
SO WHAT I DID WAS 

361
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:56,982
I MOUNTED THE BOARD ON KIND 
OF A DISPLAY / EASEL THING
 

362
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:01,286
'CAUSE TO ME, 
THIS IS AN OIL PAINTING. 

363
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,655
AND WE HAD A BIG 
LOCAL COLLECTOR.
 

364
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,591
HE'S ABOUT 6'5", 

365
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,893
AND HE CAME OVER AND LOOKED. 
HE WAS INTERESTED IN IT,  

366
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,962
AND WE WERE HAVING KIND OF 
A SPECIAL FEATURE TODAY. 

367
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,064
YOU COULD 
MEET THE ARTIST. 

368
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:15,968
AND I THINK WE WERE DOING 
FINE UNTIL WALTER TRIED
 
TO SHAKE HIS HAND.

369
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,170
WAY TO GO, WALTER. 
KILLED ANOTHER ART SALE. 

370
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,611
[quirky upbeat music]

371
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,316
OKAY, NOW,
THIS MAY LOOK LIKE A
ROMANTIC CANDLELIGHT DINNER,

372
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,985
BUT IT'S NOT.

373
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,220
FOR STARTERS,
I'M ALONE,

374
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,923
SO THERE'S NO CHANGE FOR
ROMANCE OR JUST FRIENDS.

375
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,958
SO WHY THE CANDLES?

376
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:43,695
WELL, THAT COULD BE
BECAUSE THE POWER IS OUT.

377
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,330
MY WIFE'S OVER
AT HER MOTHER'S,

378
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:46,932
AND I'M EATING LEFTOVER CHILI

379
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:51,370
THAT I WARMED UP OVER THE
EXHAUST MANIFOLD OF
THE POSSUM VAN.

380
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:54,039
BUT THE BIG PROBLEM IS I'VE
GOT TO GET UP EARLY IN
THE MORNING,

381
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:57,376
AND ALL I'VE GOT IS THIS
ELECTRIC ALARM CLOCK.

382
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,611
OKAY, HERE'S WHERE
I GET REALLY SMART.

383
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:02,114
YOU'VE BEEN WAITING A WHILE
FOR THIS, HAVEN'T YOU?

384
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,884
THIS IS A BATTERY POWERED
SMOKE DETECTOR.

385
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:18,464
AND THIS LEVER CLOSES
THE FIREPLACE DAMPER.

386
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,733
G'NIGHT.

387
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:27,506
[snoring]

388
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:35,380
[fire alarm buzzing]

389
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:42,054
[hacking cough]

390
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,460
COME ON UP
HERE, HAROLD.

391
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:49,895
OKAY.

392
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,663
YOU SHOULD WEAR THESE
WELDING GOGGLES

393
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,332
FOR SAFETY AND
THAT KIND OF THING.

394
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,175
NO THANKS,
HAROLD.

395
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,910
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE
JUMPER CABLES?

396
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,512
WELL, LLOYD NEVER PAID
HIS ELECTRICAL BILL,

397
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,180
SO HE'S GOT NO
POWER OVER THERE.

398
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:09,748
SO WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING
TO IGNITE THE MISSILE

399
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,683
FROM POSSUM LODGE
MISSION CONTROL.

400
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,785
RIGHT HERE.

401
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,022
OKAY, RED. IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S ALL SYSTEMS GO.

402
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,257
OKAY.
GREAT. GREAT.

403
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,925
HAROLD, YOU TAKE
THIS JUMPER CABLE.

404
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,894
I WANT TO YOU TO
GO THAT TERMINAL AT
THE FAR END THERE,

405
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,195
BECAUSE I CAN'T REACH
BOTH TERMINALS.

406
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,864
SO IT TAKES TWO GUYS
TO LIGHT THIS CANDLE, BABY.

407
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,833
WOW! IT'S LIKE
THE REAL DEAL,

408
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,268
LIKE WHEN THOSE TWO GUYS
HAVE TO TURN THE KEYS

409
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,903
AT EXACTLY
THE SAME TIME.

410
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,871
WELL, WE LIKE TO DO
EVERYTHING BY THE BOOK.

411
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,339
YOU KNOW THAT, HAROLD.

412
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:35,974
THIS IS SO COOL.

413
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,744
I'M NOT DOING IT,
BUT IT'S SO COOL.

414
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:40,379
WELL, FINE.
ED, HERE.

415
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:41,947
YOU DO THE
HONOURS.

416
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,282
HAROLD, YOU DO
THE COUNTDOWN, OKAY?

417
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:44,750
OKAY, OKAY.

418
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,118
WATCH THAT.
WATCH THAT.

419
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,528
Red: GO!
Harold: ALL RIGHT.

420
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,564
INITIATING FINAL COUNTDOWN
SEQUENCE TO LAUNCH.

421
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,932
10 MINUTES AND COUNTING.

422
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,466
9 MINUTES
AND 59 SECONDS.

423
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,635
JUST START AT 10 SECONDS,
WOULD YOU, PLEASE!

424
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,637
INITIATING FINAL REVISED
COUNTDOWN TO LAUNCH.

425
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,306
TEN SECONDS.

426
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,507
HAROLD, FORGET IT.

427
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,309
5, 4, 3, 2, 1,

428
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,810
BLAST OFF!

429
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:16,882
WE HAVE LIFT-OFF!

00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,817
OH, BABY!

431
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,385
UNCLE RED!

432
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:23,388
I DON'T THINK THE MANHOLE
COVER ABSORBED 95%
OF THE FORCE.

433
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,035
THE MANHOLE
DID NOTHING.

434
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,204
THE FISH NET IS GOING
TO DO NOTHING AT ALL,
UNCLE RED.

435
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,113
OH, YEAH, HAROLD?

436
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,315
THE FISH NET CAUGHT
IN THE RAFTERS,

437
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,184
JUST LIKE I PLANNED.

438
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:55,387
[possum squealing]

439
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,256
MEETING TIME.

440
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,691
YOU GO AHEAD.
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

441
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,628
AND IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

442
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,329
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT
HOME AFTER THE MEETING.

443
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,832
KIND OF HOPING WE CAN PUT AN
END TO OUR OWN PERSONAL
COLD WAR.

444
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:09,735
I'M CERTAINLY READY
TO LAY DOWN MY ARMS.

445
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,703
AND TO REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

446
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:14,239
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND HAROLD
AND THE WHOLE GANG UP HERE
AT POSSUM LODGE,

447
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,508
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

[cheers and applause]

ALL RIGHT, MEN,

00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:44,836
BOW YOUR HEADS
FOR THE MAN'S PRAYER.

456
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:47,272
I'M A MAN, BUT I CAN CHANGE,

457
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:51,176
IF I HAVE TO,
I GUESS.

458
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,078
OKAY, GUYS,

459
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,147
WELL, WE GOT THE MISSILE
OFF OF LLOYD'S PROPERTY,

460
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:56,782
BUT WE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF
REPAIR WORK TO DO ON THE ROOF.

461
00:21:56,848 --> 00:22:00,085
[explosion]

462
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,822
AND THE LODGE ITSELF,
APPARENTLY.

463
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:08,460
