00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:07,159
to see if any of my old
girlfriends have come
to their senses,

162
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:09,394
when I saw some guy's
trying to unload

163
00:07:09,394 --> 00:07:10,896
an above-ground pool.

164
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:12,931
And I'm thinking, hey,
that could be just the ticket.

165
00:07:12,931 --> 00:07:14,433
Now, I don't have any
money to give him,

166
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:16,168
but maybe we can work out
a trade of some kind.

167
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:17,769
We'll see.

168
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,548
Okay, that was
a mistake.

169
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:32,084
I should have
emptied it first.

170
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:39,558
The only thing I need
from the pool is the side.

171
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:41,359
Cutting it in half

172
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:43,495
so I get two wide rings
of sheet metal.

173
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:45,664
It's light,
it's durable

174
00:07:45,664 --> 00:07:47,065
and it's smooth,

175
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:48,700
a lot smoother than
the roads around here.

176
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,002
But I'm not going to be
driving on the roads anymore.

177
00:07:51,002 --> 00:07:53,605
I'm going to be driving
on these babies.

178
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:55,507
Maybe I'm getting
a little ahead of myself,

179
00:07:55,507 --> 00:07:57,742
but I'm just trying
to keep up with you guys.

180
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:17,329
I'm using these
lawn mower handles

181
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:19,998
as guides
for my pool sides.

182
00:08:19,998 --> 00:08:22,067
Of course, taking the
handles off the lawn mowers

183
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:23,902
means I can't
cut the grass,

184
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:25,937
so it's a win-win.

185
00:08:31,877 --> 00:08:33,678
The idea here
is to put something

186
00:08:33,678 --> 00:08:36,047
between your
tires and the road,

187
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:38,683
something that will
smooth out the bumps...

188
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:40,452
kinda like your
what wife does

189
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:42,621
between you and
the neighbours.

190
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:45,890
Funny how slipping a ring on
can change your life forever.

191
00:08:48,793 --> 00:08:51,162
Now, I'll just glide
over the potholes.

192
00:08:51,162 --> 00:08:52,697
And here's
another bonus...

193
00:08:52,697 --> 00:08:55,200
real easy to find this car
in the parking lot.

194
00:08:56,835 --> 00:09:00,105
So remember, if the women
don't find you handsome,

195
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:02,707
they should at least
find you handy.

196
00:09:05,143 --> 00:09:06,811
And if the cops
pull you over

197
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:08,513
and ask you what
the heck it is,

198
00:09:08,513 --> 00:09:11,316
tell them
it's a car pool.

199
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:14,986
[ APPLAUSE ]

200
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:23,061
I know it took a while,

201
00:09:23,061 --> 00:09:25,430
but I've finally,
mostly, pretty much,

202
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,565
begun to embrace
the Internet,

203
00:09:27,565 --> 00:09:31,803
especially the stuff
on used-crap.com.

204
00:09:31,803 --> 00:09:33,538
The problem is

205
00:09:33,538 --> 00:09:36,307
just as I was getting
comfortable with this
technology,

206
00:09:36,307 --> 00:09:40,011
they went ahead
and invented the blog.

207
00:09:40,011 --> 00:09:41,880
This is the place
in cyberspace

208
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:47,185
where any person whose
brain is half the size
of their leisure time

209
00:09:47,185 --> 00:09:49,854
can spout off about what they
think of what they do

210
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:52,290
or who they feel should be
running the country.

211
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,194
It used to be called,
Talking to Dad.

212
00:09:56,194 --> 00:09:58,496
But of course
now it's gone global.

213
00:09:58,496 --> 00:10:01,432
A lot of you older guys
are logging on.

214
00:10:01,432 --> 00:10:04,502
Well, here's my advice:
log off.

215
00:10:04,502 --> 00:10:06,838
Your own wife doesn't
particularly care

216
00:10:06,838 --> 00:10:09,140
that you're getting close
to patenting your idea

217
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,711
for the T-shirt with the
deodorant built right
into the armpits.

218
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:16,214
What makes you think
they're dying

219
00:10:16,214 --> 00:10:19,117
for this information
in Finland?

220
00:10:19,117 --> 00:10:21,185
My advice is
to relax

221
00:10:21,185 --> 00:10:24,222
and go back to annoying
your immediate family.

222
00:10:24,222 --> 00:10:27,592
And if at the end of the day,
you really feel

223
00:10:27,592 --> 00:10:30,128
like you just got
to share your opinions
and petty complaints

224
00:10:30,128 --> 00:10:31,696
with the whole world,

225
00:10:31,696 --> 00:10:33,464
do it the
old-fashioned way...

226
00:10:33,464 --> 00:10:35,833
get your
own TV show.

227
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,336
Remember,
I'm pulling for you.

228
00:10:38,336 --> 00:10:40,538
We're all
in this together.

229
00:10:42,974 --> 00:10:46,144
Don't play Texas Hold 'Em
with your septics.

230
00:10:46,144 --> 00:10:48,813
If you see one,
and it raises you
two on the river,

231
00:10:48,813 --> 00:10:51,616
call me before you
go all in.

232
00:10:58,323 --> 00:10:59,924
C'mon, Harold,
we're good to go.

233
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:01,592
Okay, I'll
be right there!

234
00:11:01,592 --> 00:11:04,562
Two-man kayak
trials are today.

235
00:11:04,562 --> 00:11:06,130
You know, I think Harold
and I can win this thing,

236
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,400
if we can figure
out how to cheat.

237
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,203
You know, Uncle Red,
I don't know about this.

238
00:11:12,203 --> 00:11:13,771
We're going
to be fine, Harold.

239
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:16,007
Here, put your
number on.

240
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:19,177
I'm a zero?

241
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:21,045
This is supposed
to cheer me up?

242
00:11:21,045 --> 00:11:22,613
Well,
look at this way,

243
00:11:22,613 --> 00:11:24,082
if the boats finish
in numerical order,

244
00:11:24,082 --> 00:11:26,317
you'll be ahead
of number one.

245
00:11:27,685 --> 00:11:29,153
See, I went
with number nine,

246
00:11:29,153 --> 00:11:30,788
that's Bobby Hull's
number.

247
00:11:30,788 --> 00:11:33,524
Because we're going to be
in a bobbing hull?!

248
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:36,961
Right, we're going
to be in bobbing hull.

249
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:40,298
You know Harold,
I can't wait for your
first Eskimo roll.

250
00:11:40,298 --> 00:11:41,666
Well, me either,
me either.

251
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,135
I hear they're
delicious.

252
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:45,303
Yeah.

253
00:11:45,303 --> 00:11:47,071
Well, the kayak's
all ready, Harold.

254
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,541
We're going
to clean up.

255
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,879
Wow, I never thought
I'd be going down
the river

256
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:58,282
in a 12-foot Maytag.

257
00:11:58,282 --> 00:12:01,118
You'll be going
down the river just
fine, Harold.

258
00:12:01,118 --> 00:12:03,054
Or up the creek.

259
00:12:03,054 --> 00:12:05,957
Why do you always have
to be so negative,
Harold, eh?

260
00:12:05,957 --> 00:12:06,824
She's light.

261
00:12:06,824 --> 00:12:08,893
She's strong.
She's seaworthy.

262
00:12:08,893 --> 00:12:10,561
And the galvanized
metal is perfect

263
00:12:10,561 --> 00:12:13,297
for the toxins
in our fresh water.

264
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:14,899
It doesn't look
very comfortable.

265
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:18,236
No, no, it's fine.
I took the agitator out.

266
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:21,772
But you just
put him back in.

267
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:23,474
Right?

268
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:24,942
Bobbing hull,
bobbing hull!

269
00:12:35,853 --> 00:12:37,888
RED: Bill and Winston went
down to the batting cage

270
00:12:37,888 --> 00:12:40,358
we have just outside
Possum Lake there.

271
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:42,026
And Bill's in a hurry

272
00:12:42,026 --> 00:12:43,694
but Winston says,
Don't forget your helmet.

273
00:12:43,694 --> 00:12:46,597
You need the batting helmet.
There you go -- Oh!

274
00:12:46,597 --> 00:12:48,899
Just a little outside.

275
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,634
That's a little small.

276
00:12:50,634 --> 00:12:52,236
No, you got to get
that on there, Bill.

277
00:12:52,236 --> 00:12:54,605
Get it on there.
Get it on -- no!

278
00:12:54,605 --> 00:12:56,807
Look out, look out,
look out... oh!

279
00:12:56,807 --> 00:13:03,681
Look at the bright side,
the hat fits now.

280
00:13:03,681 --> 00:13:05,182
and they've
got all the gear.

281
00:13:05,182 --> 00:13:06,484
Actually, Bill was going
to do the batting

282
00:13:06,484 --> 00:13:07,685
and Winston was going
to do the catching.

283
00:13:07,685 --> 00:13:09,253
Ooh, oh it's --

284
00:13:09,253 --> 00:13:12,256
Oh, safety --
safety is an important.

285
00:13:12,256 --> 00:13:14,592
I think that's supposed
to go under the --

286
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:18,596
All right,
all right, okay.

287
00:13:18,596 --> 00:13:22,199
I hope the Ride Program's
not out today.

288
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:25,035
And so, as I was saying,
Winston was going to
do the catching,

289
00:13:25,035 --> 00:13:26,837
and Bill was going to --
easy, ohh --

290
00:13:26,837 --> 00:13:27,905
Look out, look out,
look out.

291
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:29,774
Okay. Okay.
Wow.

292
00:13:29,774 --> 00:13:31,642
No kids, eh?

293
00:13:31,642 --> 00:13:34,545
All right, so you've seen
these batting cages deal.

294
00:13:34,545 --> 00:13:36,247
You get in, you pick
your favourite bat

295
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:37,548
and you get ready.

296
00:13:37,548 --> 00:13:40,117
Bill's got quite
a wind up going there.

297
00:13:40,117 --> 00:13:42,887
I think you missed --
I think you missed --

298
00:13:42,887 --> 00:13:45,322
No, no, let --
leave well enough alone.

299
00:13:45,322 --> 00:13:47,658
I think you missed
an important step here.

300
00:13:47,658 --> 00:13:49,426
You've got to --
It involves --

301
00:13:49,426 --> 00:13:50,528
It involves --

302
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:52,763
Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill.

303
00:13:52,763 --> 00:13:54,231
Money, quarter.

304
00:13:54,231 --> 00:13:55,633
Money, quarter,
in the box,

305
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:56,834
Quarter in --
quarter --

306
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:59,303
Yup, yup,
quarter in, quarter.

307
00:13:59,303 --> 00:14:01,505
Then you can pick what kind
of pitch you want there.

308
00:14:01,505 --> 00:14:02,740
You got slow ball,
slow pitch.

309
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,677
He goes for the fast ball,
and that's all ego.

310
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:07,978
All ego right now.

311
00:14:07,978 --> 00:14:09,947
So he gets ready.
Here comes the fast ball.

312
00:14:09,947 --> 00:14:11,782
And...

313
00:14:13,517 --> 00:14:14,852
So Bill's still
watching.

314
00:14:14,852 --> 00:14:16,921
Reaction time
a little slower.

315
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:18,389
You know, yeah...

316
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:19,924
So maybe
let's re-think that.

317
00:14:19,924 --> 00:14:21,091
Go with the slow pitch.

318
00:14:21,091 --> 00:14:22,493
He's going to be able
to hit this one.

319
00:14:22,493 --> 00:14:24,261
So he gets back
and in she comes.

320
00:14:24,261 --> 00:14:25,863
He just drills it,

321
00:14:25,863 --> 00:14:29,199
and it goes right down
the throat of the machine,

322
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,267
jams all the machinery.

323
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:32,469
Now they got no more
balls coming,

324
00:14:32,469 --> 00:14:35,005
so they decide to approach
the machine with caution

325
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:40,110
and see if they can --

326
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,079
I think if you just touch it
you may be able to
free that up,

327
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,281
but just be careful.

328
00:14:44,281 --> 00:14:46,483
You might want
to shut that off first

329
00:14:46,483 --> 00:14:48,552

the knuckle ball.

335

Nobody ever got hurt
with a knuckle ball.

that won't help.

You're at strike three

not even there yet.
