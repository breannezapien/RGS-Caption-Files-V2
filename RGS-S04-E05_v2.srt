ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN

2
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:06,005
IS THAT WOMEN KIND OF
SEE THE BIG PICTURE,

WHEREAS MEN KINDA
SEE EVERYTHING IN
LITTLE WEE PARTS.

YOU'RE FILTERING OUT HERE
GERMS AND BACTERIA
AND CHEMICALS,

150
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:08,060
ALSO ODORS
I'M THINKING.

151
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,796
BAKING SODA WORKS
IN YOUR FRIDGE, RIGHT?

152
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:16,535
I WILL JUST GET
THE KID-PROOF TOP --

153
00:07:16,535 --> 00:07:20,038
KID-PROOF TOP ON
THAT NO PROBLEM.

154
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:31,983
AND I'LL PUT THAT
IN THERE.
ALL RIGHT.

155
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:33,485
ALSO GOOD WITH
DEALING WITH ODORS

156
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:37,355
AND ALSO DOING
FILTERING IS KITTY LITTER.

157
00:07:37,355 --> 00:07:39,725
NOW, I WOULD RECOMMEND
YOU USE FRESH KITTY LITTER.

158
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:47,099
I'M ALL FOR RECYCLING
BUT ONLY UP TO A POINT.
DUMP THAT IN THERE.

159
00:08:00,412 --> 00:08:03,648
USE A LOT OF
KITTY LITTER.

160
00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:07,252
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT.

161
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:09,054
THE WATER IS GOING
TO BE CLEAN ENOUGH I
THINK AT THIS POINT.

162
00:08:09,054 --> 00:08:11,990
SO THE DIRTY SCUMMY
WATER IS GOING TO
GO IN THE TOP

163
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,192
AND THE CLEAN FRESH
WATER IS GOING TO
COME OUT THE BOTTOM,

164
00:08:14,192 --> 00:08:16,995
SO YOU GOT TO DRILL A
HOLE SO YOU CAN PUT
A PIPE IN THERE.

165
00:08:16,995 --> 00:08:18,230
ALL RIGHT.

166
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:22,434
OH, NO, YOU WANT
TO STERILIZE THIS.

167
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:26,071
THIS I MEAN.

168
00:08:26,071 --> 00:08:28,306
AND THERE WE GO.

169
00:08:28,306 --> 00:08:32,010
AGAIN I MAY HAVE OVERDONE
IT WITH THE STERILIZING
AND HEATING.

170
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,712
ANYWAY, ONCE YOU GOT
THE HOLE IN THERE,

171
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:37,515
GET YOURSELF A TAP
AND PUT IT ON A PIECE
OF COPPER PIPE LIKE THIS,

172
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:39,251
JAM THAT IN THE HOLE,

173
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:41,453
AND THIS WAY YOU
WILL BE ABLE TO
CONTROL THE FLOW

174
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:44,756
OF THE PURE, CLEAN,
FILTERED WATER.

175
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:50,395
ALL RIGHT.
NOW WE TURN
THAT OFF FOR A SEC,

176
00:08:50,395 --> 00:08:55,367
POUR THE CRUMMY WATER
INTO THE TOP, AND
NOW WE'RE READY.

177
00:08:55,367 --> 00:09:01,006
JUST WAIT A FEW SECONDS
AND OUT COMES PURE
SPRING WATER.

178
00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:03,074
ALL RIGHT, WE SEEM
TO HAVE SOME KIND
OF A CHEMICAL --

179
00:09:03,074 --> 00:09:04,609
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

180
00:09:04,609 --> 00:09:10,982
MAYBE THE NITRO PILLS...

181
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:14,786
ALL RIGHT.

182
00:09:14,786 --> 00:09:18,223
MAYBE THAT SPRING
WATER WAS A LITTLE
TOO SPRINGY.

183
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:20,325
YOU KNOW, SHE'S HEADING
RIGHT OVER INTO POSSUM
LAKE, WHICH IS GOOD,

184
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:23,962
THAT'LL PURIFY THE
WATER OVER THERE.

185
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:26,598
AND NOW I'LL BE ABLE
TO CATCH RAIN WATER.

186
00:09:26,598 --> 00:09:29,367
YOU CAN'T GET BETTER,
PURER, CLEANER WATER
THAN THAT.

187
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:32,337
AND THEN NEXT WEEK
WE'LL SHOW YOU HOW
TO PATCH A ROOF.

188
00:09:32,337 --> 00:09:35,140
SO UNTIL THEN REMEMBER,
IF WOMEN DON'T FIND
YOU HANDSOME,

189
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,376
THEY SHOULD AT
LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

190
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:41,846
I HOPE IT RAINS SOON
THAT KITTY LITTER
MAKES YOU THIRSTY.

191

DRILL A WELL,

192

YOU DON'T WANT
TO MISS THAT,

193
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,886
AND HAROLD AND I ARE
GOING TO HAVE A
MAN-TO-MAN TALK

194
00:09:47,886 --> 00:09:50,255
WHICH IS TOUGH
TO DO WITH HAROLD.

195
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,694
I WANT TO TALK TO ALL
YOU MIDDLE-AGE GUYS
ABOUT YOUR EYESIGHT.

196
00:09:56,694 --> 00:09:58,963
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH,

197
00:09:58,963 --> 00:10:00,899
HOLDING THE NEWSPAPER
BETWEEN YOUR TOES

198
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,102
SO YOU CAN
FOCUS ON THE PAGE.

199
00:10:04,102 --> 00:10:05,436
TRYING TO LOOK UP
A PHONE NUMBER

200
00:10:05,436 --> 00:10:08,640
AND SQUINTING SO HARD
YOU THROW YOUR BACK OUT.

201
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,842
NOW A LOT OF
GUYS OUR AGE ARE
GETTING GLASSES.

202
00:10:10,842 --> 00:10:12,410
I SAY DON'T DO IT.

203
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,480
DETERIORATING EYESIGHT
IS PART OF THE
MASTER PLAN.

204
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,248
MOTHER NATURE IS
PRETTY SMART, YOU KNOW,

205
00:10:17,248 --> 00:10:19,684
LIKE THE WAY THAT AS
YOU GET SHE MAKES
YOUR TEETH FALL OUT

206
00:10:19,684 --> 00:10:23,988
SO YOU'LL EAT OATMEAL
AND OTHER STUFF THAT'S
GOOD FOR YOU.

207
00:10:23,988 --> 00:10:26,057
IT'S THE SAME KIND OF
THING WITH YOUR EYESIGHT,

208
00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:28,426
BECAUSE GUYS OUR AGE
ARE A LOT HAPPIER
NOT KNOWING

209
00:10:28,426 --> 00:10:30,662
EXACTLY WHAT
THEY LOOK LIKE

210
00:10:30,662 --> 00:10:33,464
OR WHAT EACH OTHER
LOOKS LIKE

211
00:10:33,464 --> 00:10:36,401
IF YOUR PARTNER IS
AROUND THE SAME AGE.

212
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:37,835
IF YOUR PARTNER IS
A LOT YOUNGER THAN YOU,

213
00:10:37,835 --> 00:10:41,105
IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT
NEED THE GLASSES.

214
00:10:41,105 --> 00:10:42,740
AS FAR AS BOOK READING
IS CONCERNED,

215
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,475
YOU GOT TO GET ALL THAT
IN BY THE TIME YOU'RE 30

216
00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:47,645
SO YOU'LL HAVE TIME TO
APPLY ALL THE KNOWLEDGE
YOU PICKED UP.

217
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:49,414
ANY KNOWLEDGE THAT
YOU GET AT MY AGE,

218
00:10:49,414 --> 00:10:50,715
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH
TIME TO UNDERSTAND

219
00:10:50,715 --> 00:10:53,318
AND NOT ENOUGH
NERGY TO PRACTICE.

220
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:55,320
SO I SAY JUST LET
YOUR EYES GO.

221
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,989
THEY SAY YOUR EYES ARE THE
WINDOW TO YOUR MIND AND
IF YOUR EYES ARE FAILING

222
00:10:57,989 --> 00:11:02,560
THERE'S A PRETTY GOOD
CHANC YOUR BRAIN IS ON
ITS LAST LEGS, TOO.

223
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,163
SO JUST LET THEM GO
AND THEN WHEN YOU DIE

224
00:11:05,163 --> 00:11:08,700
YOU CAN WILL THEM TO
SOMEBODY YOU DON'T LIKE.

THE REPAIRMAN FROM
THE ELECTRIC COMPANY?

231
00:11:36,627 --> 00:11:38,863
WELL, NOT MUCH, JUST
EXPLAINED HOW THAT
BIG GUST OF WIND

HAD BLOWN THE HIGH

RIGHT UP --
IT'S JUST AN
EXPRESSION, HAROLD,

237
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,612
YOU KNOW, THE STRANGEST
THING HAPPENED

238
00:11:54,612 --> 00:11:56,347
BECAUSE A CLOUD
FORMED OVER THE LAKE

COMING UP ALL THE
BUBBLES OUT OF WATER.

THAT'S ELECTROLYSIS.

ALL THE FISHES' UNSIGHTLY
FACIAL HAIR?

242
00:12:04,355 --> 00:12:06,357
NO, NO, IT'S WHEN YOU
PUT ELECTRICITY
INTO THE WATER,

243
00:12:06,357 --> 00:12:08,426

THIS IN SCHOOL.
THAT'S ELECTROLYSIS.

245
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:13,197

LIKE HYDROGEN.

HYDROGEN LIKE
IN A BLIMP?

247
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:17,201
YES, BECAUSE HYDROGEN
IS LIGHTER THAN AIR.

248
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:19,136
YEAH, LIKE YOU PUT HYDROGEN

OUT OF THERE?

WRECK THE OZONE,

THINK ABOUT THAT.

THINK PEOPLE SMOKE?

294
00:14:26,563 --> 00:14:28,732
DON'T KNOW,
DON'T CARE HAROLD.

295
00:14:28,732 --> 00:14:30,534
WELL, YOU SHOULD,
BECAUSE THEY'RE
RUINING THEIR HEALTH

296
00:14:30,534 --> 00:14:33,304
AND THEY'RE RUINING YOURS
WITH SECONDHAND SMOKE.

297
00:14:33,304 --> 00:14:35,506
WELL, EVERYTHING ELSE
I HAVE IS SECOND HAND,

298
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:37,875
I DON'T SEE WHY I
SHOULD BE GETTING
BRAND NEW SMOKE,

299
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,377
EXCEPT FROM MY VAN.

300
00:14:40,377 --> 00:14:41,612
WELL, WHY DO YOU
THINK THEY DO IT?

301
00:14:41,612 --> 00:14:43,314
I GOT A THEORY, YOU
WANT TO KNOW WHY?
I GOT A THEORY.

302
00:14:43,314 --> 00:14:46,450
DO YOU THINK MAYBE
IT'S BECAUSE THEY
WEREN'T WEANED PROPERLY?

303
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:51,121
DO YOU THINK SMOKING
IS LIKE BREAST FEEDING?

304
00:14:51,121 --> 00:14:54,425
ONLY IF YOU
INHALE, HAROLD.

305
00:14:54,425 --> 00:14:58,595
LIKE I WISH EVERYONE
IN THE WORLD WOULD JUST
GROW UP AND STOP SMOKING.

306
00:14:58,595 --> 00:15:00,397
I THINK YOU GOT A
FISH ON YOUR HOOK
THERE, HAROLD.

307
00:15:00,397 --> 00:15:03,367
I KNOW, I'VE BEEN
TRYING TO WIGGLE
HIM OFF FOR AN HOUR.

308
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:05,169
I'LL TAKE IT.
IT MIGHT BE A SALMON.

309
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:07,037
I CAN MAKE MY
FAMOUS SMOKED SALMON

310
00:15:07,037 --> 00:15:08,405
OR I GUESS IN THIS
CASE IT WOULD BE

311
00:15:08,405 --> 00:15:13,644
SECONDHAND SMOKED
SALMON, EH, HAROLD?

312
00:15:13,644 --> 00:15:17,614
DON'T INHALE.

313
00:15:17,614 --> 00:15:19,783
IT'S TIME FOR
ADVENTURES WITH BILL.

314
00:15:19,783 --> 00:15:22,519
BILL HAD ASKED ME
OVER TO GIVE HIM A
LITTLE BIT OF HELP.

315
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,521
I WAS STILL LOOKING
FOR SOME FRESH WATER,

316
00:15:24,521 --> 00:15:26,190
SO HE WAS GOING TO
DRILL A WELL

317
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,559
AND HE PICKEA SPOT
RIGHT THERE TO DRILL IT.

318
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:31,628
NO, NO, NO, I THINK
HE'S CHANGED HIS MIND.

319
00:15:31,628 --> 00:15:34,565
YEAH, HE'S GOING TO
PICK RIGHT THERE.
ALL RIGHT.

320
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:36,433
SO I WILL JUST START
THE HOLE A LITTLE BIT.

321
00:15:36,433 --> 00:15:38,602
BUT BILL'S GOT ONE OF
THESE AUGER THINGS

322
00:15:38,602 --> 00:15:41,004
THAT LOOKS A
BIT LIKE A --
OH, OH, OH.

323
00:15:41,004 --> 00:15:42,873
AND HE'S GOT A
LONG, OHH --

324
00:15:42,873 --> 00:15:46,243
THE EXTRA LENGTH
OF HANDLE ON THERE.

325
00:15:46,243 --> 00:15:47,978
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA BILL.

326
00:15:47,978 --> 00:15:50,414
SO HE PUTS THAT ON
THERE FOR A LITTLE
EXTRA LEVERAGE

327
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:52,716
AND THE AUGER GOES
BUT THEN THE THING IS

328
00:15:52,716 --> 00:15:54,818
THAT IT CATCHES ON
A ROCK AND IT STOPS.

329
00:15:54,818 --> 00:15:57,154
BILL IS NOW USING
THE LONG LEVER TO --

330
00:15:57,154 --> 00:15:58,789
REALLY TO HIS
OWN DISADVANTAGE.

331
00:15:58,789 --> 00:16:00,824
HE'S BENDING THAT STEEL.
A LOT OF TENSION ON THERE.

332
00:16:00,824 --> 00:16:04,795
AND THEN BILL DECIDED
TO GO INTO MY VAN
FOR SOME REASON.

333
00:16:04,795 --> 00:16:08,098
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

334
00:16:08,098 --> 00:16:10,434
I GUESS HE DIDN'T FIND
WHAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR.

335
00:16:10,434 --> 00:16:13,804
SO THEN WE DECIDED TO
TRY ONE OF THESE
POWER AUGERS

336
00:16:13,804 --> 00:16:15,706
WHICH HAS GOT THE
MOTOR ON THERE.

337
00:16:15,706 --> 00:16:17,507
IT'S ABOUT A 300-HORSE
ENGINE ON IT.

338
00:16:17,507 --> 00:16:19,076
BUT THE THING IS, IT
WASN'T DIGGING IN,

339
00:16:19,076 --> 00:16:20,277
IT WAS JUST
RIDING ON TOP.

340
00:16:20,277 --> 00:16:22,112
SO THEN BILL SAYS WE
NEED TO PUSH DOWN HARDER,

341
00:16:22,112 --> 00:16:24,181
GET MORE WEIGHT
ON IT.

342
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:25,515
BILL I WOULDN'T
CLIMB ON.

343
00:16:25,515 --> 00:16:27,751
BILL THAT'S NOT
COMPLETELY SAFE, BILL.

344
00:16:27,751 --> 00:16:30,187
WHAT AM I ASKING HIM?
AND THERE HE GOES.

345
00:16:30,187 --> 00:16:32,222
THAT LOOKS LIKE
KIND OF FUN.

346
00:16:32,222 --> 00:16:34,324
EASY BILL,
SLOW 'ER DOWN.

347
00:16:34,324 --> 00:16:35,993
SLOW 'ER DOWN.
SLOW 'ER DOWN BILL.

348
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:37,461
OH FOR GOSH SAKE
YOU'RE GOING TO FLY OFF.

349
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:41,598
OH, OH, OH, OH, OH.

350
00:16:41,598 --> 00:16:44,735
WELL, I BET HE
DOESN'T TRY THAT AGAIN.

351
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:46,103
I KIND OF WISH HE WOULD.

352
00:16:46,103 --> 00:16:48,271
OH YOU'RE FINE.
QUIT YOUR WHINING.

353
00:16:48,271 --> 00:16:52,142
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY
SAY, WHERE THERE'S A
WELL, THERE'S A WAY.

354
00:16:52,142 --> 00:16:53,744
GOOD THINKING, BILL.

355
00:16:53,744 --> 00:16:55,145
SO HE GETS THE HOLE
ALL DRILLED IN THERE

356
00:16:55,145 --> 00:16:57,047
AND NOW HE'S JUST GOT
TO PUT THE PIPE DOWN

357
00:16:57,047 --> 00:16:59,282
TO GET DOWN TO WHERE
THE WATER IS.

358
00:16:59,282 --> 00:17:01,017
THAT'S A STEEL PIPE.

359
00:17:01,017 --> 00:17:03,720
WE GOT SO MANY ROCKS
AROUND THE POSSUM
LODGE AREA.

360
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,722
I THINK WHAT HAPPENED
IS HE HIT A ROCK,

361
00:17:05,722 --> 00:17:08,458
STARTED TO BEND THE
PIPE UP SO IT COME
UP BEHIND HIM.

362
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,093
NEITHER ONE OF US
SAW THIS

363
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:13,230
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY HEADING
TOWARDS MY GRILL OF
THE POSSUM VAN.

364
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,866
THANK YOU BILL.
WELL, YOU GOT WATER.

365
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:18,335
IT MIGHT BE OUT OF
THE RAD THERE, BILL

366
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,603
AND IT'S GOT THE
ANTIFREEZE IN IT,

367
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:21,004
ARE YOU SURE
THAT'S WHAT --

368
00:17:21,004 --> 00:17:23,406
YEAH, YEAH.

369
00:17:23,406 --> 00:17:25,742
RED: STAY TUNED FOR
SPECIAL GUEST
GRAHAM GREENE

370
00:17:25,742 --> 00:17:27,978
AND SOME WORDS OF
ADVICE FROM BUZZ
SHERWOOD

371
00:17:27,978 --> 00:17:30,680
FOR THOSE OF YOU
WHO WILL LISTEN
TO ANYTHING.

372
00:17:32,249 --> 00:17:37,687
WELL, LET'S SEE HOW MY
WATER DIET IS WORKING.

373
00:17:37,687 --> 00:17:42,225
MM-HMM.
NOTHING.

374
00:17:42,225 --> 00:17:44,861
UNCLE RED, WHAT IS THAT
ATTACHED TO THE CEILING?

375
00:17:44,861 --> 00:17:46,530
OH, THAT'S THE VACUUM
CLEANER, HAROLD.

376
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,665
WE SUCKED UP ALL
THE HYDROGEN.

377
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:50,267
YOU KNOW IF THAT BAG
IS NOT SEALED TIGHT,

378
00:17:50,267 --> 00:17:52,936
THAT BABY IS GOING
TO DROP LIKE A STONE.

379
00:17:52,936 --> 00:17:55,739
OH, NO, WE'RE FINE.

380
00:17:55,739 --> 00:17:57,707
NO, NO, IT'S
TIGHTER THAN A
DRUM THERE, HAROLD.

381
00:17:57,707 --> 00:18:00,343
IF THERE EVER WAS
ANY DANGER WITH THE
HYDROGEN, THAT'S OVER NOW.

382
00:18:00,343 --> 00:18:02,312
UNCLE RED, WHAT
ARE WE GOING TO
DO WITH THE VACUUM?

383
00:18:02,312 --> 00:18:04,247
IT MIGHT MAKE
A GOOD LAMP.

384
00:18:04,247 --> 00:18:06,783
OH, HAROLD, YOU'D
MAKE A GOOD LAMP.

385
00:18:06,783 --> 00:18:08,818
WE'D BOTH MAKE
GOOD LAMPS

386
00:18:08,818 --> 00:18:12,589
BECAUSE I'M BRIGHT
AND HE'S BURNED OUT.

387
00:18:14,124 --> 00:18:17,060
HI, WINSTON ROTHCHILD
HERE FROM ROTHCHILD

388
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,429
SEWAGE AND SEPTIC
SUCKING SERVICES

389
00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:23,833
WHERE WE PUT
THE P-U IN PUMP.

390
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,169
I'M HERE WITH
GLEN BRACKSTON OF
BRACKSTON'S MARINA

391
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:29,005
FOR THIS WEEK'S
BOATING TIP.
HI RED.

392
00:18:29,005 --> 00:18:31,441
I THOUGHT WE'D TALK
ABOUT LAUNCHING YOUR
OWN BOAT TODAY BY YOURSELF.

393
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:34,177
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
HOW MANY PEOPLE COME UP
AND ASK ME TO HELP THEM, RED.

394
00:18:34,177 --> 00:18:35,612
LIKE I DON'T
HAVE A JOB.

395
00:18:35,612 --> 00:18:37,547
WELL, ACTUALLY, GLEN,
I GOT TO LOSE SOME
WEIGHT IN A HURRY

396
00:18:37,547 --> 00:18:39,916
AND I WAS KINDA
HOPING YOU COULD
TALK ABOUT DIETING.

397
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,085
I THOUGHT YOU
WANTED A BOAT TIP?

398
00:18:42,085 --> 00:18:43,386
WELL, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

399
00:18:43,386 --> 00:18:45,355
IF YOU'RE THIN THEN
YOUR BOAT IS NOT
GOING TO SINK.

400
00:18:45,355 --> 00:18:47,123
AND I ALSO THOUGHT
YOU WOULD BE A GUY

401
00:18:47,123 --> 00:18:49,125
WHO'D PROBABLY KNOW
A LOT ABOUT DIETS.

402
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:52,662
OH?
AND WHY WOULD YOU
THINK THAT RED?

403
00:18:52,662 --> 00:18:54,697
WELL, YOU KNOW,
YOU HAVE A LOOK --

404
00:18:54,697 --> 00:18:57,000
YOU JUST --
I JUST --

405
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,269
I ASSUMED THAT
YOU WOULD BE A DIET
EXPERT, THAT'S ALL.

406
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:02,238
WELL, NO, NOT
REALLY, BUT IF
YOU WANT TO TRY

407
00:19:02,238 --> 00:19:04,474
TO EAT WHAT I
EAT, GO AHEAD.

408
00:19:04,474 --> 00:19:05,975
NO, NO, NO,
FORGET IT.

409
00:19:05,975 --> 00:19:07,911
NO RED, MODERATION,
THAT'S THE KEY TO IT.

410
00:19:07,911 --> 00:19:09,746
YOU GOT TO HAVE
TO HAVE SELF-CONTROL

411
00:19:09,746 --> 00:19:11,381
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY SELF-CONTROL, RED,

412
00:19:11,381 --> 00:19:14,684
SO, THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE GETTING
AS BIG AS A HOUSE.

413
00:19:14,684 --> 00:19:16,653
THANK YOU, GLEN,
YOU'RE A REAL INSPIRATION.

414
00:19:16,653 --> 00:19:19,956
LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF THE SPARE TIRE
YOU GOT THERE, RED.

415
00:19:19,956 --> 00:19:22,525
SAYS MR. EIGHTEEN
WHEELER.

416
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:24,294
I GOT BIG BONES.

417
00:19:24,294 --> 00:19:26,496
YOU GOT A
BIG BELLY BONE.

418
00:19:26,496 --> 00:19:29,299
IF I HAD YOUR HEALTH,
I'D TAKE A LOT BETTER
CARE OF MYSELF, RED.

419
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:32,702
GLEN DO YOU SUPPOSE I
COULD BORROW THIS
OLD PROPANE TANK?

420
00:19:32,702 --> 00:19:34,270
YEAH, SURE.
IT'S EMPTY.

421
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,239
WE HAD A BIG RIB
ROAST LAST WEEK.

422
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:38,141
OH, NO, I WANT
AN EMPTY ONE.

423
00:19:38,141 --> 00:19:40,410
I WANT TO HOOK IT
UP TO A VACUUM CLEANER.

424
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,611
OH, RED, YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO TRY

425
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:43,980
THAT SELF-LIPOSUCTION
STUFF, ARE YOU?

426
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,481
I READ ABOUT A GUY
THAT DID THAT LAST WEEK.

427
00:19:45,481 --> 00:19:47,550
HE HOOKED IT UP TO
HIS BELLY BUTTON
INTO A CENTRAL VAC

428
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,719
AND HE SUCKED HIMSELF
INSIDE OUT, HIS
WHOLE BODY.

429
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:51,187
OH, MY GOD.

430
00:19:51,187 --> 00:19:52,388
DID THEY EVER GET
HIM BACK TO NORMAL?

431
00:19:52,388 --> 00:19:54,057
I DON'T KNOW, I DIDN'T
FINISH THE ARTICLE,

432
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:57,226
THE NEXT AVAILABLE
CASHIER OPENED UP.

433
00:19:58,161 --> 00:19:59,862
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT
PORTION OF THE SHOW.

434
00:19:59,862 --> 00:20:02,031
THIS WEEK CLAIMING TO
BE AN EXPERT WITH
MY UNCLE RED

435
00:20:02,031 --> 00:20:07,570
IS EDGAR K.B. MONTROSE.

436
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:13,309
TODAY'S LETTER
IS FROM A VIEWER
IN BRANDON, MANITOBA.

437
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:15,645
IT SAYS: DEAR EXPERT,
I LOVE TO BARBECUE

438
00:20:15,645 --> 00:20:17,447
BUT LATELY OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD
HAS BEEN OVERRUN

439
00:20:17,447 --> 00:20:20,316
BY A HUGE FLOCK OF SEAGULLS
THAT RUIN EVERYTHING.

440
00:20:20,316 --> 00:20:24,354
WHAT CAN I DO?

441
00:20:24,354 --> 00:20:25,988
ANY IDEAS THERE EDGAR?

442
00:20:25,988 --> 00:20:32,095
WELL, RED, IF THIS GUY
IS FROM BRANDON, LIKE
IT SOUNDED LIKE HE WAS.

443
00:20:35,965 --> 00:20:37,934
YES.

444
00:20:37,934 --> 00:20:41,537
AND IF HE
LOVES TO BARBECUE,

445
00:20:41,537 --> 00:20:46,509
HE PROBABLY HAS A SPARE
PROPANE TANK SITTING
BY SOMEWHERE.

446
00:20:46,509 --> 00:20:51,280
SO WHAT I RECOMMEND IS
HE TAKE THE TANK AND HE
COVER IT WITH BACON FAT,

447
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,884
ROLL IT IN BIRDSEED AND
PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE LAWN.

448
00:20:54,884 --> 00:20:57,086
OH YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, TO DRAW OUT
THE BIRDS.

449
00:20:57,086 --> 00:20:59,789
YEAH, LIKE AT OUR HOUSE,
YOU KNOW, WE GOT LIKE
A BOWL OF SUGAR WATER

450
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:01,958
TO DRAW OUT THE BEES,
YOU KNOW, SO WHEN
WE'RE EATING

451
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,860
THEY DON'T COME NEAR
US AND THEY DON'T
SCARE US

452
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,128
AND STUFF
LIKE THAT.

453
00:21:05,128 --> 00:21:06,496
OR, YOU KNOW, OR
THEY LAND ON YOUR NOSE

454
00:21:06,496 --> 00:21:08,764
AND YOU'RE PARALYZED
IN FEAR, YOU KNOW.

455
00:21:08,764 --> 00:21:10,066
I REMEMBER ONE TIME --
REMEMBER ONE TIME --

456
00:21:10,066 --> 00:21:11,934
REMEMBER THIS ONE TIME,
THIS ONE TIME, RIGHT,

457
00:21:11,934 --> 00:21:13,870
THIS BEE LANDED RIGHT
ON MY EAR, RIGHT.

458
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,738
AND MY MOM SAID DON'T MOVE,
RIGHT, SO I DIDN'T MOVE

459
00:21:15,738 --> 00:21:17,907
BECAUSE WHEN MOM SPEAKS,
YOU KNOW, RIGHT?

460
00:21:17,907 --> 00:21:19,942
BUT IT WAS A QUEEN BEE.
IT WAS A QUEEN BEE.

461
00:21:19,942 --> 00:21:22,512
AND THE QUEEN BEE BUILT
THIS HUGE HIVE RIGHT
ON MY EAR.

462
00:21:22,512 --> 00:21:24,580
IT WAS HUGE.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

463
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,984
I MISSED THE WHOLE
WEEK OF SCHOOL.
IT WAS GREAT.

464
00:21:27,984 --> 00:21:29,452
BUT DAD SPRAYED
IT WITH RAID

465
00:21:29,452 --> 00:21:34,590
AND THEN ON THE
WAY TO THE HOSPITAL HE
COLLECTED ALL THE HONEY.

466
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,293
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I MEANT, HAROLD.

467
00:21:37,293 --> 00:21:39,829
WHEN THE BIRDS COME
BY TO FEED OFF THE CAN,

468
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:42,565
HE TAKES HIS RIFLE,
SAY A THREE OT SIX.

469
00:21:42,565 --> 00:21:45,067
OH, NO, HEY,
HEY, YOU DON'T
SHOOT THE SEAGULLS.

470
00:21:45,067 --> 00:21:49,238
NO, YOU SHOOT THE CAN

471
00:21:49,238 --> 00:21:54,877
AND THEN KABOOM!

472
00:21:54,877 --> 00:21:57,546
NO MORE BIRDS.

473
00:21:57,546 --> 00:22:00,082
NO MORE PROBLEM.

474
00:22:00,082 --> 00:22:05,021
AND THE CONCUSSION WILL
SHATTER ANY SEAGULL EGGS
WITHIN TWO MILES.

475
00:22:06,288 --> 00:22:09,859
YOU KNOW, IF YOU CAN'T
BE WITH THE PLANE
YOU LOVE,

THIS DIET THING LICKED.

UNCLE RED I WAS ONLY
KIDDING ABOUT YOU
BECOMING A LAMP.

479
00:22:19,602 --> 00:22:21,971
NO, NO, HAROLD, I
REVERSED THE WIRING
ON THE VACUUM CLEANER

480
00:22:21,971 --> 00:22:24,774
AND I COMPRESSED
ALL THE HYDROGEN DOWN
INTO THIS PROPANE TANK.

WORKS, HAROLD.
