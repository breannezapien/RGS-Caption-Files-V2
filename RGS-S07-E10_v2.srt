1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,678
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW!"

2
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,481
THE TELEVISION SHOW THAT
DARES TO ASK, "IS THERE
ANYTHING ELSE ON T.V.?"

3
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:15,949
AND NOW HERE HE IS,

4
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:18,251
YOUR HOST BY CHOICE,
MY UNCLE BY BIRTH,

5
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:21,254
RED GREEN!

6
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,096
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

7
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,498
BOY, OH, BOY.

8
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:32,899
WELCOME TO POSSUM LODGE.

9
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,969
BIG, BIG, BIG WEEK UP AT THE
LODGE THIS WEEK, I TELL YOU.

10
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:38,505
THE KIND OF THING THAT HAPPENS
MAYBE TWICE IN A LIFETIME.

11
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:40,640
HAROLD, DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD TELL THEM,

12
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:44,444
OR DO YOU THINK I SHOULD SORT OF
BUILD THE SUSPENSE LIKE THEY
DO ON THOSE BIG CHEESY
NETWORK SHOWS?

13
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,446
NO, NO, NO, YOU
TELL THEM NOW.

14
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:48,281
TELL THEM NOW BECAUSE
THIS IS BIG; THIS IS HUGE!

15
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:49,582
THIS IS BIG AND HUGE.

16
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:53,152
I DON'T THINK WE COULD
SIT ON THIS MUCH LONGER.

17
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,523
HAROLD, I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD SIT ON
ANYTHING RIGHT NOW.

18
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:57,790
CAN I GIVE THEM
A CLUE?

19
00:00:57,857 --> 00:00:59,092
LET ME GIVE
THEM A CLUE.

20
00:00:59,158 --> 00:01:00,527
OKAY, I'M GOING
TO GIVE YOU A CLUE.

21
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:06,332
TOM HANKS, TOM CRUISE,
SANDRA BULLOCK.

22
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,668
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT, HAROLD?

23
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,404
I'M TALKING ABOUT A BIG MOVIE
STAR BUYING A COTTAGE RIGHT
HERE AT POSSUM LAKE.

24
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:16,075
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
BRUNO'S BUTCHER SHOP.

25
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:19,245
WHAT?
HE'S GOT A NEW
BACON SLICER.

26
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:23,816
HIS OLD BACON SLICER GOT
PREGNANT AND MOVED TO
PORT ASBESTOS.

27
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:26,552
SO BRUNO HAS REPLACED HER WITH
AN AUTOMATED UNIT.

28
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:32,925
I'M DETERMINED TO GET THE
NUMBER ONE SIDE OF BACON
WHEN I GO UP THERE.

29
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:36,162
WHAT ABOUT TOM HANKS AND TOM
CRUISE AND SANDRA BULLOCK?

30
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:41,501
WELL, THEY MIGHT BE NUMBER ONE
AT THE BOX OFFICE, BUT THEY'LL
BE NUMBER TWO AT BRUNO'S.

31
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:57,450
[QUIRKY UPBEAT MUSIC]

32
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:02,655
HERE ARE A FEW SCENES FROM
THIS WEEK'S SHOW, AND THESE
ARE ALL FRESH GOODIES.

33
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:06,359
BUT NONE OF THIS STUFF HAS EVER
BEEN SEEN BEFORE ON TELEVISION.

34
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:10,530
YOU KNOW, I'M GUESSING
THERE'S PROBABLY A PRETTY
GOOD REASON FOR THAT.

35
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:19,839
WELL, FOR ONCE, PUBLICITY
AND HYPE WAS NOT JUST
EXAGGERATION.

36
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,176
BRUNO'S BACON SLICER
IS INCREDIBLE.

37
00:02:23,242 --> 00:02:25,144
YOU KNOW WHAT, HAROLD?
IT ALSO SHAVES HAM.

38
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,246
YEAH, WE CAN BUY SHAVED HAM NOW,

39
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:32,385
WHICH IS GOOD 'CAUSE THE HAM
THAT BRUNO WAS SELLING
HAD HAIR ON IT.

40
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:36,355
UNCLE RED, NOBODY REALLY CARES
ABOUT A BACON SLICER.

41
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,391
OH, YEAH?

42
00:02:38,457 --> 00:02:40,893
WELL, HOW COME EVERYBODY AND
THEIR COUSIN IS UP THERE IN
THE BUTCHER SHOP?

43
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,461
THEY'RE NOT THERE FOR
THE BACON SLICER.

44
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:45,631
THAT'S THE OVERFLOW FROM THE
REAL ESTATE AGENCY NEXT DOOR.

45
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:49,068
YEAH, NOBODY CARES ABOUT
HOW WELL YOU CAN SLICE
BACON OR SHAVE HAM.

46
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:52,505
REALLY?
YEAH!
WHAT A WORLD!

47
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,240
IT'S BEEN FANTASTIC. A MOVIE
STAR RIGHT UP HERE.

48
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:55,908
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

49
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:57,944
YOU KNOW THAT COTTAGE THAT
KEVIN BLACK BUILT UP ON
BLUFF'S POINT?

50
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,279
OH, YEAH.
A HOLLYWOOD STAR BOUGHT IT.

51
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,148
HOLLYWOOD?
LIKE, HOLLYWOOD?

52
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:06,285
YEAH, AS IN FREDERICK'S OF...
WOW!

53
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,320
IT'S FANTASTIC.

54
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:09,021
A HOLLYWOOD STAR RIGHT
HERE IN POSSUM LAKE.

55
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:13,659
AND THE RUMOUR IS IT'S LIKE
TOM HANKS OR TOM CRUISE OR
SANDRA BULLOCK.

56
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,161
OH, HAROLD,
COME ON, RELAX.

57
00:03:15,227 --> 00:03:16,829
THEY'RE JUST
PEOPLE, OKAY?

58
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,798
MOVIE STARS ARE NO DIFFERENT
THAN ANYBODY ELSE.

59
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:21,334
I DON'T KNOW WHY EVERYBODY HAS
TO TREAT THEM SPECIAL.

60
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,637
LIKE, IF SANDRA BULLOCK COMES
UP TO YOU ON THE STREET, WHAT
WOULD YOU DO, HAROLD?

61
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,639
OH!
WELL --

62
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:32,645
(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)

63
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:39,885
GIRL, ME BOY.
AND SHE...

64
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:41,887
SEE? THAT'S GOOD.

65
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:43,989
YOU JUST
BE YOURSELF.

66
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:51,597
OH, SHE WORKED AT
THE LOCAL LIBRARY

67
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,566
SO WE HAD NEVER MET

68
00:03:53,632 --> 00:03:55,701
BUT I WAS OUT WALKING
IT STARTED TO RAIN

69
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,803
I'D RATHER BE BORED THAN WET

70
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,972
SO I DUCKED INSIDE
THE LIBRARY DOOR

71
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,041
AND SAW HER STAMPING
SOME BOOKS

72
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:06,145
MY DECIMALS ALL GOT
DEWEY WHEN SHE GAVE ME
THAT LITERARY LOOK

73
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:08,247
OH, I PRETENDED I
LIKED READING BOOKS

74
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,449
AS I ASKED HER TO THE DANCE

75
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,284
SHE CLASSIFIED ME AS FICTION

76
00:04:12,351 --> 00:04:14,487
AND THEN LATER THIS
MOVED TO ROMANCE

77
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:16,489
YOU CAN'T JUDGE A
BOOK BY ITS COVER

78
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:18,524
THAT LIBRARIAN HAD
ME ASTOUNDED

79
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,459
SHE HAD BOTH BRAINS
AND BEAUTY

80
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,828
NOT JUST WELL-READ,
BUT WELL-ROUNDED

81
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,663
LOVE IS HARD TO READ

82
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,999
AND LIBRARIANS ARE
OFTEN FICKLE

83
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:29,068
I RETURNED HER HOME
TEN MINUTES LATE

84
00:04:29,134 --> 00:04:31,437
AND SHE HAD THE NERVE
TO FINE ME A NICKEL

85
00:04:35,374 --> 00:04:36,542
IT'S THE POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME.

86
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,812
AND WE'RE PLAYING FOR A VERY
SPECIAL PRIZE TONIGHT.

87
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:44,750
CAN YOU SAY MILLION
DOLLAR AMETHYST?

88
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:50,656
WELL, NOW YOU'LL BE ABLE TO
SPELL IT TOO WITH THIS BRAND NEW
DICTIONARY FROM STAPLES N' SUCH.

89
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:54,193
UNCLE RED.

90
00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:00,866
UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO GET Mr. MIKE HAMAR, TODAY'S
CONTESTANT, TO SAY THIS WORD.

91
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:03,569
BABY.
BABY.

92
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,571
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

93
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,972
30 SECONDS... GO!

94
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,575
ALL RIGHT, MIKE, WHEN A WOMAN IS
PREGNANT, SHE'S EXPECTING HER --

95
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,411
SOCIAL WORKER.

96
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,178
OKAY.

97
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:14,213
NO.
NO.

98
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,281
OKAY.
SHE'S A MOTHER.

99
00:05:15,347 --> 00:05:16,215
SHE HAS A --

100
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,384
PROBLEM.

101
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,718
COME ON.
OKAY.

102
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:21,120
FINISH THIS SONG, OKAY?

103
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:22,688
YES, SIR, THAT'S MY --

104
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,790
STORY.

105
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:26,191
OKAY.
OKAY.

106
00:05:26,258 --> 00:05:28,093
OKAY.
OKAY.

107
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,996
WHEN A PERSON IS VERY YOUNG,
THEY TALK, THEN THEY WALK,

108
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:33,065
THEY'RE A --

109
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:36,068
OH, A STOOLY.

110
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,102
NO.
OKAY.

111
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:39,538
THINK A LITTLE PERSON,
CRIES IN THE NIGHT.

112
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:42,608
YOU GO OVER TO COMFORT THEM.
BRING THEM A BOTTLE.

113
00:05:42,674 --> 00:05:46,412
MY CELLMATE.

114
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:48,680
ALMOST OUT OF TIME, UNCLE RED.

115
00:05:48,747 --> 00:05:49,848
OKAY.
OKAY.

116
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:51,784
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG
YOU WERE --

117
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,286
SHOOTING CRAPS.

118
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,888
YEAH, YEAH, AND WHAT
DID YOU YELL?

119
00:05:55,954 --> 00:05:56,955
COME ON, BABY!

120
00:05:57,022 --> 00:06:00,492
THERE WE GO.

121
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:11,804
ISN'T SHE A BEAUTY?

122
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,806
YOU KNOW, THERE'S ONLY TWO
THINGS THAT COME INTO
YOUR LIFE ONCE...

123
00:06:13,872 --> 00:06:17,109
TRUE LOVE AND A GOOD
USED POLICE CAR.

124
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:19,745
OH, SURE SHE MIGHT HAVE
700,000 MILES ON HER,

125
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,480
BUT IT'S ALL HIGHWAY
HIGH-SPEED CAR CHASES,

126
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:25,017
SO YOU'VE GOT NO CARBON
BUILDUP IN THERE.

127
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:30,322
UNFORTUNATELY, NOW, THERE ARE
SOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T SEE THE
VALUE IN OWNING A SECONDHAND
CAR FULL OF BULLET HOLES.

128
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:35,561
THEY DON'T APPRECIATE
THE HISTORY, THE EXCITEMENT,
THE ODOUR OF THE BACKSEAT.

129
00:06:35,627 --> 00:06:38,297
SO TODAY ON
HANDYMAN CORNER,

130
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:40,332
I THOUGHT I'D SHOW YOU HOW
TO TURN YOUR POLICE CAR

131
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,135
INTO SOMETHING YOUR FAMILY
ACTUALLY DOESN'T MIND
RIDING AROUND IN.

132
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:46,738
WE'LL START BY CLEANING THE
INSIDE OUT A LITTLE BIT.

133
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:55,147
THERE THAT'S GOT MOST OF IT.

134
00:06:55,213 --> 00:07:00,485
BY GOLLY, THERE WERE A FAIR
NUMBER OF COFFEE CUPS AND
DOUGHNUT BOXES IN THERE.

135
00:07:00,552 --> 00:07:03,288
YOU KNOW, THIS IS GOING
TO BE SUCH A THRILL FOR
THE LODGE MEMBERS.

136
00:07:03,355 --> 00:07:07,659
NOT SO MUCH RIDING IN A POLICE
CAR, BUT BEING IN THE FRONT
SEAT FOR A CHANGE.

137
00:07:07,726 --> 00:07:09,861
NOW, THERE IS ONE
DOWNSIDE HERE.

138
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:13,332
THE LAW REQUIRES THESE GUYS
GOT TO TAKE THE SIREN OFF
THERE AND CHUCK THAT AWAY.

139
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:15,300
BUT THEY LEAVE THE
WIRING ON THERE.

140
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:19,805
SO WHAT YOU NEED IS TO GET
YOURSELF A SPEAKER --

141
00:07:19,871 --> 00:07:24,309
MAYBE YOU GOT ONE OF THESE
IN YOUR ATTIC OR GET ONE
AT A YARD SALE,

142
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:29,581
OR MAYBE GO DOWN TO YOUR LOCAL
WATERING HOLE AND PORK ONE WHEN
THE BAND IS ON THEIR BREAK --

143
00:07:29,648 --> 00:07:31,850
AND YOU WANT TO ATTACH THE
SPEAKER TO THE ROOF RACK,

144
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:36,154
USING THE HANDYMAN SECRET
WEAPON, DUCT TAPE.

145
00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:38,924
ALL RIGHT. ONCE YOU GET
THE SPEAKER WIRED UP,

146
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,826
YOU CAN REALLY START
TO HAVE SOME FUN.

147
00:07:40,892 --> 00:07:42,828
HEY, JERK, PULL OVER!

148
00:07:42,894 --> 00:07:44,629
GET OUT OF THE VEHICLE.

149
00:07:44,696 --> 00:07:47,499
SPREAD 'EM!
NO, NOT THOSE.

150
00:07:47,566 --> 00:07:49,968
ALL RIGHT.
SING SOMETHING IRISH.

151
00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:51,503
BUT, YOU KNOW,
FOR THE BIG FUN,

152
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,538
YOU'VE GOT TO GET
YOURSELF A SIREN.

153
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:55,440
SEE WHAT THIS IS HERE?

154
00:07:55,507 --> 00:07:58,610
THIS IS ONE OF THESE LITTLE
DOLLS, AND WHEN YOU SQUEEZE
IT, IT CRIES.

155
00:07:58,677 --> 00:08:00,278
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO OUT
AND BUY ONE OF THESE.

156
00:08:00,345 --> 00:08:03,281
IF YOU ALREADY HAVE ONE,
YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELF.

157
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:07,118
(BABY CRYING)

158
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:09,087
THAT WILL WHIP YOU
THROUGH TRAFFIC.

159
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:13,592
THAT COULD BE A REAL LIFESAVER
WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT CHOCOLATE
BAR WAS ACTUALLY A LAXATIVE.

160
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:15,360
AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO?

161
00:08:15,427 --> 00:08:18,129
YOU CAN ACTUALLY WEDGE THE
DOLL AND THE MICROPHONE
UNDER THE GAS PEDAL,

162
00:08:18,196 --> 00:08:22,067
AND THEN WHEN YOU FLOOR IT, THE
SIREN WILL GO ON AUTOMATICALLY.

163
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:24,703
THERE ARE A FEW OTHER FEATURES
YOU GET WITH A COP CAR.

164
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:28,039
FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE TRUNK THERE,
YOU'VE GOT THE GUN RACK.

165
00:08:28,106 --> 00:08:31,042
WHAT A GREAT PLACE TO CARRY
ALL OF YOUR GARDEN TOOLS.

166
00:08:31,109 --> 00:08:33,144
THEN IF YOU GET SOME OF
THIS POLICE TAPE,

167
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:36,014
SUPER FOR MARKING OFF
YOUR PICNIC AREA.

168
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:37,716
AND YOU CAN PLAY THAT
GREAT PARTY GAME

169
00:08:37,782 --> 00:08:40,885
WHERE EVERYBODY LIES
DOWN AND YOU DRAW
AROUND THEM WITH CHALK.

170
00:08:40,952 --> 00:08:44,055
THEN IF YOU'RE LUCKY
ENOUGH TO GET YOURSELF
A COUPLE OF BODY BAGS,

171
00:08:44,122 --> 00:08:47,459
MAKE GREAT PONCHOS
FOR THE KIDS.

172
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:50,362
AND SPEAKING OF KIDS, THIS
UNIT IS IDEAL FOR FAMILIES

173
00:08:50,428 --> 00:08:54,799
BECAUSE WITH THE BUILT-IN
DIVIDER THERE, THEY CAN'T
GET AT YOU.

174
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:58,036
AND SEE, ON THE INSIDE OF THE
BACK DOOR THERE, THERE'S
NO DOOR HANDLE.

175
00:08:58,103 --> 00:09:02,374
THERE'S NO WINDOW WINDER,
SO SHE'S EXTRA SAFE.

176
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,310
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT THE KIDS DOING
DAMAGE BACK HERE.

177
00:09:05,377 --> 00:09:12,650
THIS BACKSEAT HAS SEEN FIVE
YEARS OF FELONS, AND THEY CAN
JUMP AROUND ALL THEY WANT.

178
00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:16,955
OH, BOY!

179
00:09:19,557 --> 00:09:21,192
NOW, YOU KNOW WHAT
PEOPLE SAY TO ME?

180
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:23,294
WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT
THE WEIRD PAINT JOB?

181
00:09:23,361 --> 00:09:25,163
AND I ALWAYS SAY...

182
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,132
NOTHING.

183
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:32,170
LOOKS FINE TO ME, BUT IF YOU
HAPPEN TO BE A WHINER, YOU CAN
CHANGE THE DESIGN REAL CHEAP

184
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:38,943
WITH A ROLL OF WHITE
ADHESIVE TAPE AND BLACK
ELECTRICAL TAPE.

185
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:39,878
IS IT A MUSTANG?

186
00:09:39,944 --> 00:09:41,713
IS IT A COLT?

187
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,516
NOPE, IT'S A ZEBRA.

188
00:09:44,582 --> 00:09:47,752
AND WITH ALL OF THESE STRIPES
ON HERE, YOU LOOK MORE LIKE A
CONVICT THAN A COP

189
00:09:47,819 --> 00:09:51,656
WHICH LETS YOUR FRIENDS KNOW
YOU'RE STILL ONE OF THEM.

190
00:09:51,723 --> 00:09:58,129
SO, REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN DON'T
FIND YOU HANDSOME, THEY SHOULD
AT LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

191
00:09:58,196 --> 00:10:01,933
YOU KNOW, I'M FEELING HUNGRY,
AND I THINK IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

192
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,937
(BABY CRYING)

193
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,844
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU OLDER
FELLERS OUT THERE.

194
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:14,979
YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

195
00:10:15,046 --> 00:10:19,484
YOU GUYS WHO USED TO MAKE SPLIT
DECISIONS ABOUT BUYING OR
SELLING, HIRING OR FIRING.

196
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:23,955
NOW IT TAKES YOU TEN MINUTES
TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER TO PAY
BY CASH OR CREDIT CARD.

197
00:10:24,022 --> 00:10:27,659
DON'T WORRY, YOU'RE NOT
LOSING YOUR MIND!

198
00:10:27,725 --> 00:10:32,463
THIS SUDDEN INABILITY TO MAKE
DECISIONS IS ACTUALLY KIND OF
A SAFETY MECHANISM,

199
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:37,835
'CAUSE YOUR MIND DOESN'T WANT TO
MAKE COMMITMENTS THAT YOUR
BODY CAN'T KEEP.

200
00:10:37,902 --> 00:10:39,737
WHEN YOU WERE 21,
AND YOUR BODY SAID,

201
00:10:39,804 --> 00:10:42,340
"RACE YOU TO THE CORNER,"
YOU WOULDN'T HESITATE.

202
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:48,980
NOW YOUR MIND FORCES YOU TO, SO
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE PICKING
UP PIECES OF YOUR HAMSTRING
ON THE WAY BACK.

203
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:52,617
SO IF YOU FIND YOURSELF AT THE
HARDWARE STORE WELL INTO THE
SECOND HOUR OF DECIDING

204
00:10:52,684 --> 00:10:57,021
WHETHER TO BUY AN ELECTRIC
LAWN MOWER OR A GAS UNIT,

205
00:10:57,088 --> 00:10:59,524
HEY, LET YOUR SON
MAKE THE CHOICE.

206
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,593
IT'S ONLY FAIR. HE'S THE ONE
THAT WILL BE PUSHING IT!

207
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:10,234
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

208
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:11,602
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

209
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:13,438
AND IF IT IS SANDRA BULLOCK WHO
BOUGHT THAT PROPERTY UP THERE,

210
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:17,642
I'M JUST GOING TO GO UP
AND SEE IF SHE NEEDS A
PERSONAL MASSEUSE.

211
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:24,148
OR MAYBE, YOU KNOW, JUST
A GUY TO STARE AT HER.
I COULD DO THAT.

212
00:11:24,215 --> 00:11:27,018
HAROLD, HAROLD, I FOUND OUT WHO
BOUGHT THE BIG COTTAGE.

213
00:11:27,085 --> 00:11:28,019
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE IT.

214
00:11:28,086 --> 00:11:29,287
HOLD ON.
HOLD ON.

215
00:11:29,353 --> 00:11:31,255
MY UNCLE FOUND OUT WHO BOUGHT
THE BIG COTTAGE. HOLD ON.

216
00:11:31,322 --> 00:11:32,457
WAS IT SANDRA BULLOCK?

217
00:11:32,523 --> 00:11:34,492
NO, NO, NO, THINK REALLY,
REALLY FAMOUS.

218
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,194
SHARON STONE?

219
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,429
OH, THE SPICE GIRLS.
MADONNA.

220
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:41,566
NO, NO, NO.
THINK NOT A WOMAN.

221
00:11:41,632 --> 00:11:44,969
RUE PAUL.

222
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:49,674
A GREAT ACTOR.

223
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,242
TOM HANKS.
TOM CRUISE!

224
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:53,144
NO, SOMEBODY I THINK
IS A GREAT ACTOR.

225
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:56,547
OH, TOM ARNOLD.
NO!

226
00:11:56,614 --> 00:12:00,384
FLIPPER.
YOSEMITE SAM.
STOP!

227
00:12:00,451 --> 00:12:01,485
I WILL TELL YOU WHO IT IS.

228
00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:02,920
OKAY.

229
00:12:02,987 --> 00:12:06,190
WERNER KLEMPERER.

230
00:12:06,257 --> 00:12:08,559
WERNER KLEMPERER RIGHT
HERE, HAROLD.

231
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:11,429
WOW!
IT'S WERNER KLIMPNER.

232
00:12:11,495 --> 00:12:13,865
WERNER KLIMPNER BOUGHT A
COTTAGE RIGHT HERE!

233
00:12:13,931 --> 00:12:15,066
I DON'T KNOW.
I'LL ASK HIM.

234
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:16,934
WHO IS HE?

235
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:19,804
OH, HAROLD, YOU KNOW
COLONEL KLINK.
YOU KNOW.

236
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:26,744
HOGAN! NOBODY ESCAPES
FROM STALAG 13.

237
00:12:26,811 --> 00:12:29,547
BOY, THE GUYS ARE
GOING TO GO NUTS.

238
00:12:29,614 --> 00:12:31,248
WERNER KLEMPERER RIGHT HERE.

239
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:33,317
I'VE GOT TO GO TELL THEM.

240
00:12:33,384 --> 00:12:37,989
THIS IS THE BIGGEST THING
SINCE HUGH BEAUMONT WENT
FISHING IN MERCURY CREEK.

241
00:12:39,557 --> 00:12:41,659
DOING A LITTLE GOLF.

242
00:12:41,726 --> 00:12:43,461
WELL, ACTUALLY, THE DRIVING
RANGE THING FOR ADVENTURES
WITH BILL TODAY.

243
00:12:43,527 --> 00:12:49,500
BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL DAY.
OH, OH, OH. BY GOLLY.

244
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:51,902
SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT MY
STEEL-TOED GOLF SHOES.

245
00:12:51,969 --> 00:12:53,270
EASY NOW.

246
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:55,740
WITH THE GOLFER, YOU GET OUT --

247
00:12:55,806 --> 00:12:59,610
OH, BOY, BILL HAS
A LOT OF BALLS.

248
00:12:59,677 --> 00:13:04,348
YOU GET OUT IN THE GOLF RANGE
THERE, AND YOU KNOW YOU ENJOY
THE WEATHER AND --

249
00:13:04,415 --> 00:13:06,317
OH, FOR GOSH SAKES.

250
00:13:06,384 --> 00:13:09,186
STILL HASN'T FIXED THE HOLE
IN THAT POCKET, OBVIOUSLY.

251
00:13:09,253 --> 00:13:11,155
CAN WE START NOW, BILL?

252
00:13:11,222 --> 00:13:16,660
OH, OH, OH! OH!

253
00:13:16,727 --> 00:13:18,629
FOR YOU YOUNGSTERS OUT
THERE, CHEW YOUR FOOD.

254
00:13:18,696 --> 00:13:19,964
ALL RIGHT?

255
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:20,965
OH, NO, HERE HE GOES
WITH HIS TRICKS.

256
00:13:21,031 --> 00:13:23,567
OH, MAN.

257
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:27,271
I THINK BILL REALLY WANTED TO
BE A VAUDEVILLE PERFORMER WITH
HIS LITTLE MAGIC ACT AND
EVERYTHING.

258
00:13:27,338 --> 00:13:33,010
THIS IS HIS FIRST
PERFORMANCE, I BELIEVE.

259
00:13:33,077 --> 00:13:35,079
AND THERE'S HIS FIRST REVIEW.

260
00:13:35,146 --> 00:13:38,349
ALL RIGHT. SO WE'VE GONE UP
TO THE DRIVING RANGE AND PUT
THE BALLS UP THERE.

261
00:13:38,415 --> 00:13:41,652
THAT LOOKS KIND OF NEAT LIKE
SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING, EXCEPT
WITHOUT THE NOSE PLUGS.

262
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:45,022
OH. OH, EASY. EASY.

263
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:47,224
HOW IS THAT LEATHER
HIP WORKING OUT?

264
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:50,361
THERE YOU GO.
HIT A BEAUTY.

265
00:13:50,427 --> 00:13:52,663
OH, LOOK AT THAT, 200 YARDS
IF YOU'RE METRIC,

266
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,199
THAT'S AS FAR AS WHATEVER
200 YARDS IS.

267
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:57,601
OKAY. AND THEN, BILL -- LET HER
GO THERE, BILL.

268
00:13:57,668 --> 00:14:01,171
BOY, OH, BOY.

269
00:14:01,238 --> 00:14:02,773
LIKE I SAY, IT'S A
BEAUTIFUL DAY.

270
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,576
AND I GUESS YOU'RE DONE FOR
THE DAY, ARE YOU, BILL?

271
00:14:05,643 --> 00:14:08,312
OH, NO. NO, DON'T WORRY.
IT WAS A RENTAL.

272
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:10,180
ALL RIGHT, LET HER GO.

273
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:11,482
NICE SHOT.

274
00:14:11,548 --> 00:14:15,753
OH, THAT'S A BEAUTY.
BEHIND YOU, BILL.

275
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:19,323
OH, HE'S GOT AN IDEA. OH.

276
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,592
IF HE HITS THE OTHER WAY --
OKAY, GOING TO HIT
IT THE OTHER WAY,

277
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:23,794
AND THEN IT WILL
COME BACK AND GO FORWARD.

278
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:26,096
YOU MIGHT WANT TO MOVE
THE BUCKET OF BALLS.

279
00:14:26,163 --> 00:14:28,599
YOU MIGHT WANT TO
MOVE THAT BUCKET.

280
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,669
HE DIDN'T. OH!

281
00:14:31,735 --> 00:14:33,671
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BILL.

282
00:14:33,737 --> 00:14:35,973
BEAUTIFUL DAY.
BEAUTIFUL DAY OUT.

283
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,475
DON'T LET IT BOTHER YOU.
DON'T LET IT BOTHER YOU.

284
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:41,578
YOU'VE GOT TO RELAX IN GOLF.
YOU'VE GOT TO STAY WITHIN
YOURSELF.

285
00:14:41,645 --> 00:14:43,047
ANOTHER BEAUTY.

286
00:14:43,113 --> 00:14:46,016
NOTHING TO THIS GAME.
HIT THE TREE!

287
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:49,987
OH! BY GOLLY.

288
00:14:50,054 --> 00:14:51,221
FORE!

289
00:14:51,288 --> 00:14:52,923
HEAD.

290
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,625
FORE HEAD.

291
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:56,160
I LOVE THE GAME, REALLY.

292
00:14:56,226 --> 00:14:59,430
OH, NOW HE'S CHALLENGING ME.
OH, I SEE, ACCURACY.

293
00:14:59,496 --> 00:15:01,231
ACCURACY, NOT JUST DISTANCE.

294
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:03,367
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?
I DON'T GET THAT.
OH, WELL.

295
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:05,135
I CAN HIT THE TREE.
WATCH THIS.

296
00:15:05,202 --> 00:15:06,303
I'LL NAIL THIS PUPPY.

297
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,138
HERE WE GO.
THERE WE GO.

298
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:11,909
OH! OH, I SEE.

299
00:15:11,975 --> 00:15:13,744
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE
HAD IN MIND THERE.

300
00:15:13,811 --> 00:15:16,313
ALL RIGHT. NOW BILL WANTS
ME TO DO IT AGAIN.

301
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,315
OH, A DIFFERENT TREE.
DIFFERENT TREE.

302
00:15:18,382 --> 00:15:20,050
YEAH, SURE, I CAN DO THAT.

303
00:15:20,117 --> 00:15:21,685
I DON'T GET THIS.

304
00:15:21,752 --> 00:15:26,089
OH, OH, HE'S GOING TO PUT
THE HELMET ON. OH, OKAY.

305
00:15:26,156 --> 00:15:28,725
WELL, I'LL REALLY GET IT THEN.

306
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:31,762
OH, GOSH.
JOHN DALEY.

307
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:35,232
OH, OFF THE VAN.
OH, WELL.

308
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:38,001
OH, MY GOODNESS.

309
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:43,140
OH, WELL, BILL, YOU CAN ADOPT.

310
00:15:43,207 --> 00:15:44,875
ALL RIGHT, IT'S STARTED!

311
00:15:44,942 --> 00:15:47,010
COLONEL KLINK HAS
BEEN -- SORRY,

312
00:15:47,077 --> 00:15:49,847
WERNER KLEMPERER HAS BEEN
SPOTTED UP AT HIS NEW
PROPERTY THERE.

313
00:15:49,913 --> 00:15:53,417
YOU SEE, ALL THE GUYS ARE UP
THERE HIDING IN THE BUSHES.

314
00:15:53,483 --> 00:15:56,486
GOT THE BINOCULARS, THE
TELESCOPES THERE.

315
00:15:56,553 --> 00:15:59,089
JUNIOR SINGLETON, HE SAID
COLONEL KLINK LOOKS EXACTLY

316
00:15:59,156 --> 00:16:01,225
THE SAME AS HE DID ON
"HOGAN'S HEROES,"

317
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:05,262
EXCEPT HE'S A LOT OLDER AND
DOESN'T HAVE THE NAZI'S
UNIFORM ON.

318
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:06,463
YOU KNOW, UNCLE RED,

319
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,699
I DON'T THINK HE WANTS
TO BE DISTURBED.

320
00:16:08,765 --> 00:16:13,604
HE'S GOT NO TRESPASSING SIGNS
AND BIG HIGH FENCES AND
ELECTRICAL ALARM SYSTEM
AND GUARD DOGS.

321
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,907
HAROLD, HE JUST WANTS THE PLACE
TO LOOK LIKE STALAG 13,

322
00:16:16,974 --> 00:16:21,411
SO EVERYBODY WILL KNOW
WHERE HE LIVES.
THAT'S ALL.

323
00:16:21,478 --> 00:16:23,513
YOU WANT TO COME
UP WITH US?
NO!

324
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,784
ANYBODY WHO DID ONE T.V. SERIES
LONG BEFORE I WAS BORN
IS NO CELEBRITY TO ME.

325
00:16:27,851 --> 00:16:30,287
WELL, HAROLD, HE MIGHT HAVE
SOME FRIENDS THAT YOU LIKE.

326
00:16:30,354 --> 00:16:34,958
MAYBE BRUCE WILLIS MIGHT BE
UP THERE OR CLINT EASTWOOD,
MAYBE ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER.

327
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:40,030
OR SANDRA BULLOCK?
SURE! OKAY.
I'M COMING.

328
00:16:40,097 --> 00:16:41,131
HANG ON.
OKAY.

329
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:41,998
I'M READY.
I'M READY.

330
00:16:42,065 --> 00:16:43,533
WHOA.
WHOA.

331
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,001
HE WON'T AUTOGRAPH ALL THAT
MANY PIECES OF PAPER.

332
00:16:45,068 --> 00:16:47,704
AUTOGRAPH! YOU'RE
SO NAIVE.

333
00:16:47,771 --> 00:16:50,240
YOU'RE LIKE THE NAIVEST
OF THE NAIVE.

334
00:16:50,307 --> 00:16:53,210
THIS IS MY SCREENPLAY. I'M
GOING TO SHOW IT TO HIM.

335
00:16:53,276 --> 00:16:58,248
"HAROLD IN BIKINI LAND."

336
00:16:58,315 --> 00:17:00,717
IT'S A ROMANTIC COMEDY.

337
00:17:00,784 --> 00:17:07,290
COULD BE MY BIG BREAK.
SANDRA BULLOCK'S TOO!

338
00:17:08,158 --> 00:17:12,629
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU YOUNGER
VIEWERS WHO ARE STILL IN YOUR
TEENS AND STILL HAVE A CHANCE
TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.

339
00:17:12,696 --> 00:17:16,333
YOU HEAR A LOT OF KIDS TODAY
SAYING THEY WANT TO BE FAMOUS.

340
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:18,068
NOW, I'M NOT A CAREER
COUNSELOR OR ANYTHING,

341
00:17:18,135 --> 00:17:21,872
BUT THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOAL
THAT'S DANGEROUSLY VAGUE.

342
00:17:21,938 --> 00:17:23,540
THERE'S A GUY WHO IS FAMOUS NOW,

343
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:25,375
EVEN GOT HIS PICTURE
IN THE GUINNESS BOOK
OF WORLD RECORDS

344
00:17:25,442 --> 00:17:28,111
BECAUSE HE WEIGHS OVER
A THOUSAND POUNDS.

345
00:17:28,178 --> 00:17:31,982
I'M GUESSING WHEN HE WAS
15 AND SAID SOME DAY I'M
GOING TO BE FAMOUS,

346
00:17:32,048 --> 00:17:36,953
HE WASN'T PICTURING HIMSELF
SPREAD OVER A COUCH WITH A
CHIN THE SIZE OF A PILLOW.

347
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,524
ACTUALLY, MOST PEOPLE THAT ARE
FAMOUS ARE TRULY INFAMOUS.

348
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,225
YOU LOOK DOWN THROUGH THE
FAMOUS PEOPLE IN HISTORY.

349
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:45,395
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF DICTATORS
AND DESK POTS IN THERE.

350
00:17:45,462 --> 00:17:49,833
AND EVEN THE WELL-KNOWN
ATHLETES NOW ARE USUALLY
FAMOUS FOR SOME SCANDAL

351
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,371
INVOLVING STEROIDS OR
FISTS OR LINGERIE.

352
00:17:54,437 --> 00:17:58,041
I TELL YOU SOMETHING, FAME
IS NOT AN HONOURABLE GOAL.

353
00:17:58,108 --> 00:18:00,377
YOU'VE GOT TO AIM
A LITTLE HIGHER.

354
00:18:00,443 --> 00:18:03,113
GO FOR THE MONEY.

355
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:08,051
WELCOME TO THIS WEEK'S
INSTALLMENT OF MEN'S ANONYMOUS.

356
00:18:10,353 --> 00:18:13,990
AS USUAL, AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE
TO INVITE MY UNCLE RED UP HERE

357
00:18:14,057 --> 00:18:16,059
TO LEAD US ALL IN THE MEN
ANONYMOUS PLEDGE.

358
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:19,496
UNCLE RED.

359
00:18:19,562 --> 00:18:27,003
I'M A MAN, BUT I CAN CHANGE
IF I HAVE TO, I GUESS.

360
00:18:30,707 --> 00:18:39,382
OKAY. TO START US OFF THIS WEEK,
I HAVE AN OLD FRIEND THAT HASN'T
BEEN AT THE LODGE IN 17 YEARS.

361
00:18:39,449 --> 00:18:41,117
HI, EVERYBODY. MY NAME
IS RANGER GORD.

362
00:18:41,184 --> 00:18:46,756
WAIT. HO, HEY,
NO LAST NAMES.

363
00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:57,500
HI, EVERYBODY. MY
NAME IS RANGER.

364
00:18:57,567 --> 00:19:03,072
AS YOU KNOW, I'VE SPENT THE LAST
18 YEARS UP AT FIRE WATCHTOWER
13 LOOKING OUT FOR FIRES.

365
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:06,476
UNTIL, OF COURSE,
I ATE THE TOWER.

366
00:19:06,543 --> 00:19:11,981
DURING THAT TIME, I DID
SOMETHING THAT I'M VERY
ASHAMED OF,

367
00:19:12,048 --> 00:19:14,450
ESPECIALLY DURING MY
LAST FEW YEARS.

368
00:19:14,517 --> 00:19:19,589
YOU SEE, BEING UP THERE ALONE
FOR AS LONG AS I'VE BEEN,
WITHOUT ANY VISITORS --

369
00:19:19,656 --> 00:19:21,257
WELL, EXCEPT, OF COURSE,
FOR YOU, RED.

370
00:19:21,324 --> 00:19:22,525
I DO THANK YOU FOR THAT.

371
00:19:22,592 --> 00:19:23,860
IT WAS GREAT.

372
00:19:23,927 --> 00:19:27,096
I MEAN, THEY WERE REALLY,
REALLY HELPFUL.

373
00:19:27,163 --> 00:19:31,634
BUT LET'S BE HONEST, RED.
YOU'RE NOT A WOMAN.

374
00:19:31,701 --> 00:19:35,505
YOU'RE NOT. YOU NEVER WERE,
AND THAT'S NOBODY'S FAULT.

375
00:19:35,572 --> 00:19:40,944
THE THING IS, WHEN I WAS UP
THERE, I MADE A VOW TO BE
TRUE TO MY DREAM GIRL,

376
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,845
JULIE KOTTER.

377
00:19:42,912 --> 00:19:47,350
GABE KOTTER'S WIFE FROM "WELCOME
BACK KOTTER," THE HIT T.V. SHOW.

378
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:51,554
OH, I WANTED TO BE HER
SWEAT HOG, I TELL YOU.

379
00:19:51,621 --> 00:19:54,057
I MEAN, SHE WAS MY DREAM
GIRL, YOU KNOW.

380
00:19:54,123 --> 00:19:58,061
ANYWAY, ONE NIGHT, AND I'M --
I'M NOT VERY PROUD OF THIS.

381
00:19:58,127 --> 00:20:03,700
ONE NIGHT, I HAD A DREAM
ABOUT MARCIA BRADY.

382
00:20:03,766 --> 00:20:08,071
AND THEN NIGHT AFTER NIGHT,
IT WAS MARCIA, MARCIA, MARCIA.

383
00:20:08,137 --> 00:20:11,207
AND THEN I GET BACK HERE -- I
GET BACK HERE AND I SEE THAT

384
00:20:11,274 --> 00:20:15,511
MARCIA BRADY IS INCREDIBLY
FAMOUS AND JULIE KOTTER IS GONE!

385
00:20:15,578 --> 00:20:20,149
SHE'S GONE, NOT EVEN
DOING DINNER THEATRE.

386
00:20:20,216 --> 00:20:27,056
AND NATURALLY I BLAME MYSELF
BECAUSE I DREAMT ABOUT MARCIA,
NOT JUST JULIE.

387
00:20:27,123 --> 00:20:31,361
I CAN'T HELP THINKING
IT'S ALL MY FAULT!

388
00:20:31,427 --> 00:20:35,765
I RUINED JULIE'S LIFE!

389
00:20:35,832 --> 00:20:37,734
LET'S SHOW A LITTLE
BIT OF SUPPORT, GUYS.

390
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,871
(APPLAUSE)

391
00:20:41,938 --> 00:20:45,508
I LOVE YOU GUYS.

392
00:20:50,413 --> 00:20:53,483
WELL, POSSUM LAKE IS NO LONGER
HOLLYWOOD NORTH.

393
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:55,751
WERNER KLEMPERER IS GONE!

394
00:20:55,818 --> 00:20:59,722
OH, GOD, NO ONE ESCAPES
FROM POSSUM LAKE.

395
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:05,228
HOW WAS THAT?

396
00:21:05,294 --> 00:21:08,297
I KNOW!
I KNOW!

397
00:21:08,364 --> 00:21:11,400
I GUESS THERE'S JUST NOT
ENOUGH EXCITEMENT UP HERE
FOR A BIG STAR, HAROLD.

398
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:12,902
EXCITEMENT?

399
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:14,470
THAT'S WHAT HE CAME UP
HERE FOR IS TO GET AWAY
FROM THE EXCITEMENT.

400
00:21:14,537 --> 00:21:16,105
YOU GUYS RUINED IT FOR HIM.

401
00:21:16,172 --> 00:21:17,640
OH, HOW DID WE RUIN IT?

402
00:21:17,707 --> 00:21:19,509
BY ASKING FOR HIS AUTOGRAPH.

403
00:21:19,575 --> 00:21:20,676
WELL, BIG STARS ARE USED TO --

404
00:21:20,743 --> 00:21:23,179
WHEN HE WAS IN THE SHOWER.

405
00:21:23,246 --> 00:21:27,116
ASKING HIM HOW COME HE DIDN'T
DO ANY GOOD WORK AFTER
"HOGAN'S HEROES."

406
00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:30,419
ARE YOU REALLY A NAZI
IN REAL LIFE?

407
00:21:30,486 --> 00:21:33,890
EVERYBODY STEALING BITS
OF CHROME OFF HIS CAR
FOR SOUVENIRS.

408
00:21:33,956 --> 00:21:37,026
HAROLD, WE WERE JUST TRYING TO
SHOW HIM THAT HE WAS ONE OF US.

409
00:21:37,093 --> 00:21:39,228
I EVEN SAID THAT TO HIM,
"YOU'RE ONE OF US."

410
00:21:39,295 --> 00:21:43,466
THAT HURT HIM DEEPLY.
YOU COULD SEE THAT.

411
00:21:43,532 --> 00:21:45,735
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
MADE HIM ANGRY, HAROLD.

412
00:21:45,801 --> 00:21:49,372
ME?
YEAH, ASKED HIM IF HE
KNEW SANDRA BULLOCK,

413
00:21:49,438 --> 00:21:53,209
OR IF HE COULD GET YOU A DATE
WITH HER -- OR WITH ANYONE.

414
00:21:53,276 --> 00:21:56,245
(POSSUM CALL)

415
00:21:56,312 --> 00:21:57,980
WELL, IT'S MEETING
TIME, UNCLE RED.

416
00:21:58,047 --> 00:22:00,349
I'M GOING TO GO AND
TELL THE GUYS THAT
WERNER KLEMPERER HAS
LEFT.

417
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,718
ALL RIGHT.
UNLESS YOU WANT
TO DO IT.

418
00:22:02,785 --> 00:22:06,288
I KNOW NOTHING!

419
00:22:06,355 --> 00:22:11,827
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT DO YOU WANT
TO TELL THE GUYS --

420
00:22:11,894 --> 00:22:14,597
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING, I'LL
BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

421
00:22:14,664 --> 00:22:16,832
AND I'M GOING TO BRING
YOU SOME SLICED BACON.

422
00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:21,370
BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOME
SHAVED HAM, I'M SORRY, THE
BEARD STAYS.

423
00:22:21,437 --> 00:22:23,139
FOR THE REST OF YOU, THANKS
FOR WATCHING.

424
00:22:23,205 --> 00:22:26,442
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND HAROLD
AND THE WHOLE GANG UP HERE AT
POSSUM LODGE,

425
00:22:26,509 --> 00:22:30,946
YOU KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

426
00:22:33,282 --> 00:22:36,752
[CAPTIONS PERFORMED BY
CAPTION RESOURCE CENTER]

427
00:22:36,819 --> 00:22:38,387
THE VEST. OKAY.

428
00:22:38,454 --> 00:22:39,188
EVERYBODY SIT DOWN.

429
00:22:39,255 --> 00:22:42,324
EVERYBODY SIT DOWN.

430
00:22:42,391 --> 00:22:45,494
ALL RISE.

431
00:22:47,263 --> 00:22:49,865
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI.

432
00:22:49,932 --> 00:22:52,668
SIT DOWN.

433
00:22:52,735 --> 00:22:54,136
OKAY. WE'VE GOT SOME
ANNOUNCEMENTS.

434
00:22:54,203 --> 00:22:55,838
THIS IS FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT.

435
00:22:55,905 --> 00:22:58,040
TYLER AND TYLER INSURANCE
BROKERS WANT TO REMIND
EVERYONE THAT

436
00:22:58,107 --> 00:23:00,676
DUE TO THE EXTENSIVE FIRE
DAMAGE, THEY WILL NOT BE
ABLE TO HANDLE ALL OF YOUR

437
00:23:00,743 --> 00:23:04,780
INSURANCE NEEDS UNTIL THEY FIND
A NEW LOCATION AND SOMEBODY TO
INSURE IT.

438

TYLER AND TYLER INSURANCE, AND
THEIR NEW SLOGAN IS, HEY, IT
CAN HAPPEN.
