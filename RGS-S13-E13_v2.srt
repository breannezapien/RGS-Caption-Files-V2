WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT TO HAVE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT AT HOME?

TAKING AN AIRPLANE,

NOBODY KNOWS WHERE
THE BODY IS.

157
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,732
OH, YEAH, HE'S AT
PORT ASBESTOS ARENA,

158
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:50,035
DISNEY ON ICE.

UM, I'M NOT SURE IF
I UNDERSTAND WHAT
CRYOGENICS IS.

160
00:07:54,406 --> 00:07:56,808
OH, DON'T ENCOURAGE
HIM, MIKE.

161
00:07:56,808 --> 00:07:58,643
THEY STOP YOUR HEART,

162
00:07:58,643 --> 00:08:00,979
AND THEN THEY IMMERSE YOU
IN LIQUID NITROGEN

163
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:03,081
AND THEN IN THE FUTURE
THEY BRING YOU BACK TO LIFE

164
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:04,916
AND FIX WHATEVER'S
WRONG WITH YOU.

165
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,953
YEAH, LIKE, SAY,
FREEZER BURN.

166
00:08:07,953 --> 00:08:12,858
SO, UH, WOULD YOU ADVISE THAT
IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING
FOR THIS VIEWER?

167
00:08:12,858 --> 00:08:15,827
WELL, NOBODY'S EVER DONE IT,
SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY RESULTS.

168
00:08:15,827 --> 00:08:17,395
COULD BE RISKY.

169
00:08:17,395 --> 00:08:18,897
OH, FOR SURE.

170
00:08:18,897 --> 00:08:22,567
A COUPLE YEARS AGO OLD MAN
SEDGWICK HAD HIS
ASSETS FROZEN.

171
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:24,736
NOW HE WALKS WITH A LIMP.

172
00:08:26,304 --> 00:08:30,909
SO I WOULD ADVISE THAT THIS
VIEWER SHOULD PROCEED
WITH EXTREME CAUTION.

173
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:32,477
OH, YOU'RE
RIGHT THERE, MIKE.

174
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:36,314
IT'S ALSO BEST TO
LET SOME THINGS LIE.

175
00:08:36,314 --> 00:08:38,883
THAT'S WHAT
WE DO WITH HAP.

[ APPLAUSE ]

177
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:45,423
YOU EVER SEE THESE
AUTOMATIC COFFEE MAKERS

178
00:08:45,423 --> 00:08:48,860
THAT HAVE THE TIMER SO YOU
CAN WAKE UP TO THE SMELL
OF FRESH COFFEE?

179
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,930
YOU KNOW WHAT I CALL THAT?
NICE TRY.

180
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,298
COFFEE'S NOT ENOUGH.

181
00:08:53,298 --> 00:08:54,899
YOU CAN'T JUST HAVE
COFFEE FOR BREAKFAST.

182
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:56,735
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT
MEAL OF THE DAY.

183
00:08:56,735 --> 00:09:00,805
FOR A LOT PEOPLE,
IT'S THE LAST DECENT MEAL
THEY'LL HAVE UNTIL LUNCH.

184
00:09:00,805 --> 00:09:03,041
WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER IF YOU
COULD USE THE TECHNOLOGY

185
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,777
OF CLOCKS AND TIMERS
TO HAVE YOUR WHOLE BREAKFAST

186
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:07,912
PREPARED BEFORE
YOU'RE EVEN AWAKE?

187
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:09,781
WELL, IF YOU
DIDN'T THINK SO,

188
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:11,783
YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE
WATCHING THIS SHOW.

189
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:13,852
OKAY, THE FIRST
THING YOU WANNA GET

190
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:15,453
IS ANOTHER COFFEE MAKER.

191
00:09:15,453 --> 00:09:17,255
I WOULD SUGGEST
YOU GO SECOND HAND.

192
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:20,892
IT'S CHEAPER AND WE'RE GONNA
PRETTY MUCH VOID THE
WARRANTY ANYWAY.

193
00:09:20,892 --> 00:09:22,861
TAKE THE COFFEE POT
OUTTA THERE.

194
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:25,563
AND REPLACE IT
WITH A SMALL FRY PAN.

195
00:09:25,563 --> 00:09:27,332
SET IT RIGHT DOWN
ON THE HEATING ELEMENT,

196
00:09:27,332 --> 00:09:29,200
'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE'RE
GONNA DO ALL OUR COOKIN'.

197
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,469
BUT WE NEED THE FOOD TO GET
THERE AT THE RIGHT TIME.

198
00:09:31,469 --> 00:09:33,405
HOW ARE WE GONNA DO THAT?

199
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:35,206
LIKE CLOCKWORK.

200
00:09:35,206 --> 00:09:36,841
YOU CAN GET RID
OF THE EXTRA COFFEE POT.

201
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:38,810
WE DON'T NEED
THAT ANYMORE.

202
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:42,247
TOO STRONG FOR YOU?

203
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:45,984
I HAD TO RE-JIG THE
ALARM CLOCK A LITTLE BIT.

204
00:09:45,984 --> 00:09:48,686
SO INSTEAD OF THE HAMMERS
RINGING THOSE BELLS

205
00:09:48,686 --> 00:09:51,756
THAT'S THE CAUSE OF SO MANY
BROKEN BEDROOM WINDOWS,

206
00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:53,491
I TOOK THE BELLS
RIGHT OUTTA THERE

207
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:55,193
AND REPLACED THEM
WITH A COUPLE OF EGGS.

208
00:09:55,193 --> 00:09:57,395
THIS HERE IS JUST
AN OLD SCHOOL RULER

209
00:09:57,395 --> 00:09:59,230
THAT I WAS SUPPOSED
TO USE IN GEOMETRY,

210
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,734
BUT INSTEAD MY TEACHER
USED IT ON MY BACKSIDE.

211
00:10:02,734 --> 00:10:05,570
AND NOW IT BECOMES
THE SAUSAGE FEEDER

212
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,273
FOR MY AUTOMATIC
BREAKFAST MACHINE.

213
00:10:08,273 --> 00:10:10,408
JUST GOTTA PUT A
COUNTERWEIGHT ON THIS END,

214
00:10:10,408 --> 00:10:13,444
WHICH WILL START THE TOASTER
ONCE THE SAUSAGES ARE
IN THE PAN.

215
00:10:13,444 --> 00:10:15,580
A LOT OF COORDINATION
NEEDED HERE,

216
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,382
BUT I THINK
WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

217
00:10:17,382 --> 00:10:21,352
I SET THE COFFEE MAKER AND THE
ALARM CLOCK FOR 7:00 a.m.,

218
00:10:21,352 --> 00:10:23,621
AND I CUSTOMIZED
THE CUCKOO CLOCK,

219
00:10:23,621 --> 00:10:26,758
SO NOW IT'LL ONLY
GO OFF AT 7:00.

220
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:29,727
NOW I JUST NEED TO MOVE THE
WHOLE UNIT TO THE KITCHEN.

221
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:31,362
YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING WHY

222
00:10:31,362 --> 00:10:32,964
I DIDN'T JUST BUILD
THE THING IN THE KITCHEN.

223
00:10:32,964 --> 00:10:34,999
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU DON'T KNOW MY WIFE.

224
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:37,135
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO DO
PROJECTS INSIDE THE HOUSE

225
00:10:37,135 --> 00:10:40,605
EVER SINCE I DID
THAT VALVE JOB ON THE
DINING ROOM TABLE...

226
00:10:40,605 --> 00:10:42,473
DURING DINNER.

231
00:11:26,517 --> 00:11:28,853
I WAS LISTENING
TO THE RADIO THE OTHER DAY,

232
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:30,655
AND THEY PLAYED OUR SONG,

233
00:11:30,655 --> 00:11:33,658
THE SONG THEY WERE PLAYING
WHEN BERNICE AND I MET.

234
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:35,927
IT'S FUNNY
HOW SOMETIMES A SONG

235
00:11:35,927 --> 00:11:37,995
CAN DEFINE
A RELATIONSHIP.

236
00:11:37,995 --> 00:11:41,566
LIKE HAROLD'S SONG
IS "ALONE AGAIN."

237
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:44,602
AND DALTON AND ANNE MARIE'S
SONG IS, I BELIEVE,

238
00:11:44,602 --> 00:11:47,705
"WHO'S SORRY NOW?"

239
00:11:47,705 --> 00:11:49,740
BUT FOR
BERNICE AND I,

240
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,342
IT'S "BLUEBIRDS OVER
THE MOUNTAIN" BY THE KING,

241
00:11:51,342 --> 00:11:54,679
THAT'S RIGHT,
URSEL HICKEY.

242
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:57,014
REMEMBER URSEL HICKEY?
BOY, OH, BOY, OH, BOY.

243
00:11:57,014 --> 00:11:59,183
BUT THE ONE THEY PLAYED
ON THE RADIO JUST NOW

244
00:11:59,183 --> 00:12:01,953
WAS LIKE BY
SOME COVER BAND.

245
00:12:01,953 --> 00:12:03,287
I MEAN,
WHAT IS WITH THAT?

246
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:05,022
IT WASN'T
URSEL HICKEY AT ALL.

247
00:12:05,022 --> 00:12:07,225
IT WAS A NO NAME.

248
00:12:07,225 --> 00:12:08,626
HOLY COW.

249
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:10,027
I MEAN, BERNICE AND I,
WE WANT THE REAL THING,

250
00:12:10,027 --> 00:12:12,964
ESPECIALLY WHEN
IT COMES TO HICKEYS.

251
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:14,765
WHAT WAS WITH
THESE GUYS?

252
00:12:14,765 --> 00:12:16,834
WHY WOULD THEY RE-DO
A PERFECTLY GOOD SONG

253
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:18,169
AND DO IT BADLY?

254
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:21,038
I MEAN, I SOMETIMES
DO MY OWN VERSION OF STUFF.

255
00:12:21,038 --> 00:12:23,074
I MIGHT TAKE A COUPLE
OF PING PONG BATS

256
00:12:23,074 --> 00:12:26,010
AND A WEED-WACKER AND MAKE
A CEILING FAN OUT OF THEM

257
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,347
BUT BY GOLLY,
I WOULD NEVER DISRESPECT

258
00:12:29,347 --> 00:12:32,416
A CLASSIC MUSICAL RENDITION
LIKE URSEL HICKEY DID

259
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,085
OF "BLUEBIRDS
OVER THE MOUNTAINS."

260
00:12:34,085 --> 00:12:35,786
SO IF THERE ARE
ANY MUSICIANS OUT THERE,

261
00:12:35,786 --> 00:12:38,055
FOR HEAVEN SAKES,
THERE WILL NEVER BE
ANOTHER URSEL HICKEY

262
00:12:38,055 --> 00:12:41,058
GET OVER IT.

263
00:12:41,058 --> 00:12:43,094
START MAKING
YOUR OWN NOSTALGIA

AS LONG AS I KEEP
MY CLOTHES ON.

00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:16,694
I SAID YEAH,
BUT YOU KNOW,

I CAN'T CONTROL
WHAT THE WOMEN WEAR

OR CHOOSE
NOT TO WEAR.

IF THEY DECIDE
TO GO AL FRESCO ON THIS THING

I MIGHT SEE

I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO SEE.

I GUESS WE'LL TAKE THIS SPOT.

IMMEDIATELY THAT THE TENT
TRAILER SEEMED TO BE MISSING.

311
00:14:45,582 --> 00:14:48,819

BUT I DON'T THINK HE'S GOT IT.

MIKE INTO THE UNIT.

IT WORKS, GUYS.

329

EVERYBODY GO TO A CORNER

330
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:37,334
BECAUSE THERE'S A LEG ON
EACH CORNER OF THESE UNITS,

331
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:39,069
AND THEY PULL OUT
AND THEY SNAP DOWN

332
00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:40,838
AND THEY KINDA
TELESCOPE OUT

AND THEY HOLD THE
THING TOTALLY LEVEL.

THERE, DALTON.

WELL, HIS WAS KIND OF
RUSTED SOLID THERE,

337
00:15:47,678 --> 00:15:49,479

LITTLE TOO MUCH FOOT ENERGY.

00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:51,715

REALLY WEDGED ON THERE,

MOVING WITH THE HAMMER,

GONNA USE THAT HAMMER THAT
MUCH THIS WEEKEND...

THERE'S NOTHING THERE AT ALL,

SPOTTED THAT OTHER --

THOSE THINGS WERE FOR.

WAIT THE WHOLE TIME,

357
00:16:38,695 --> 00:16:41,832

BEFORE SHE'S GONE TO HER
FULL ELEVATION.

358
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:43,867
AND OF COURSE WHAT HAPPENS

359
00:16:43,867 --> 00:16:45,535
IS SHE GETS A LITTLE TIGHTER
AS SHE GETS TO THE TOP.

360
00:16:45,535 --> 00:16:47,270
SHE SNAPS OFF
RIGHT IN MY HAND,

AND THE WHOLE
THING COLLAPSES.

YEAH, THEY'RE FINE.

365
00:16:58,115 --> 00:17:00,050

JUST GET MIKE OUT,

HAVE ROOM TO WIGGLE THERE.

CORDLESS DRILL IN THE VAN.

UP TO THE AXLE.

HAD HER GOIN' THE WRONG WAY.
