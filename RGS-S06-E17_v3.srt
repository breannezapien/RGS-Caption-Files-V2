1
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:03,837
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:06,806
NOW, HERE'S THE REASON

3
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:08,308
THAT GOD MADE WORMS SLOW --

4
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:11,211
YOUR HERO, MY UNCLE, RED GREEN!

5
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:13,646
(Applause and cheering)

6
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:14,781
THANK YOU.

7
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,349
THANK YOU -- APPRECIATE IT.

8
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:18,752
(Howling)

9
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:22,288
(Cheering and whistling)

10
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:23,056
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

11
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:25,892
WE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU.

12
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:26,726
I GOTTA WARM UP

13
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:27,794
MY BATTING ARMS.

14
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:29,095
TONIGHT IS THE TRYOUT

15
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:29,996
FOR THE POSSUM LODGE

16
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:31,131
MEN'S BASEBALL TEAM.

17
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,266
BASEBALL'S A FANTASTIC SPORT.

18
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:35,101
IT'S AMERICA'S
FAVOURITE PASTIME.

19
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:37,570
IT WAS, BEFORE
"THE JERRY SPRINGER" SHOW.

20
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:42,242
HAROLD, IT'S A GAME
YOU CAN PLAY YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

21
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:43,810
MY HERO IS BABE RUTH.

22
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,912
FAT, SMOKED CIGARS,
ATE LIKE A PIG,

23
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:47,580
DRANK LIKE A FISH,
AND HIT 50 HOME RUNS.

24
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:52,085
YOU GOT FOUR OUT OF FIVE
COVERED.

25
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,220
(Audience laughing)

26
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,823
NO, HAROLD, I'M SAYIN'
IF YOU'RE A NATURAL,

27
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,525
YOU CAN DO IT FOR A LONG TIME.

28
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,393
I COULD BE
THE NEXT CAL RIPKEN JR.

29
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,162
CALL ME "THE IRON MAN".

30
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:04,631
HOW ABOUT THE RUST BUCKET?

31
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:07,133
(Audience laughing)

32
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:08,401
YOU KNOW,

33
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,438
I FIND IT ODD THAT NO ONE'S
INVITED ME TO TRY OUT.

34
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,506
THAT SURPRISES
YOU, HAROLD?

35
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,810
I CAN THROW, I CAN RUN --
I SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO TRY OUT.

36
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,380
COME ON, YOU CAN TRY OUT
AS BACK-CATCHER.

37
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,715
I DON'T HAVE
ANY PADS.

38
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:23,316
I KNOW.

39
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:29,222
(Horns honking)

40
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,026
(Geese honking)

41
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:36,529
(Quacking)

42
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,068
(Red): YOU'RE LOOKIN'
AT SEGMENTS

43
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:43,470
FROM THIS PARTICULAR SHOW,

44
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,704
THE MAIN MESSAGE BEING,

45
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,173
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT CHANGING THE CHANNEL.

46
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:50,343
TO MAKE SENSE
OUT OF THIS PROGRAMME,

47
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:51,778
YOU GOTTA GIVE IT

48
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,580
YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.

49
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:06,993
WELL, THERE'S NO JOY
IN MUDVILLE, I CAN TELL YOU.

50
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:08,228
JUST A
BAD-LUCK DAY.

51
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,929
YOU'LL DO BETTER
NEXT SEASON.

52
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,764
CAN'T BELIEVE
I DIDN'T MAKE THE TEAM.

53
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,633
WHERE DID I GO WRONG?

54
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,202
YOU WERE A TAD SLOW
AGAINST THAT FASTBALL.

55
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,339
HE WAS SWINGING WHEN THE OTHER
TEAM WAS COMING OFF THE FIELD.

56
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,708
(Laughing)

57
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,843
THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD ATTEMPT
AT A BUNT.

58
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,678
THAT WASN'T
A BUNT ATTEMPT.

59
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,214
I HAD CRAMPS
FROM THE CHILI DOGS

60
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,818
AND I JUST BENT OVER
TO LET THE PRESSURE OFF.

61
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,021
WHEN THE BALL

62
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,257
HIT THE BAT, I BUNTED
AND BELCHED AT THE SAME TIME.

63
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,559
I DIDN'T HEAR IT HIT...

64
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,094
THE BUNT, THAT IS.

65
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:43,796
IT WAS A CLOSE CALL.

66
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,732
DON'T
YOU THINK?
NOT AT ALL.

67
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,301
YOUR SLIDE WAS MORE OF A FLOP.

68
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:51,304
I DON'T THINK GOING HEAD-FIRST
IS A GOOD IDEA.

69
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:53,706
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULDN'T
START SLIDING

70
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,441
TILL YOU'RE HALF-WAY CLOSE
TO THE BAG.

71
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,110
I TRIPPED, HAROLD, OK?

72
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,380
YOU WEREN'T DOIN' SO GREAT
AT CATCHING -- I SAW YOU!

73
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,316
YOUR THROWS TO THE PITCHER
WENT INTO CENTRE FIELD.

74
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:04,817
DON'T WORRY.

75
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:06,619
LOOKS LIKE I’M GOING TO BE SITT

76
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,054
SITTING IN THE STANDS WITH YOU
THIS YEAR TOO.

77
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,423
OH, NOT WITH ME.

78
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:11,691
I MADE THE TEAM.

79
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,359
WHAT? PARDON ME?

80
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,328
I MADE THE TEAM.

81
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,362
THEY SAID
THEY NEVER SAW ANYBODY

82
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,463
WITH A RIGHT ARM LIKE MINE.

83
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,299
THEY SIGNED ME UP
AS THE PITCHER.

84
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,834
(Audience laughing)

85
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,570
YOU MADE THE TEAM?

86
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:26,005
I ASKED FOR $5 MILLION
OVER THREE YEARS,

87
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:28,708
WITH A $200,000 SIGNING,
BUT, YOU KNOW...

88
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,777
I SETTLED FOR
THE FREE SHOE LACES.

89
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,547
UH... WELL,
UH...

90
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,817
GOOD, GOOD,
VERY GOOD.

91
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,419
UH, EXCELLENT.

92
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,754
THEY'VE REALLY LOWERED
THEIR STANDARDS

93
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:43,389
SINCE THE LEAGUE EXPANDED.

94
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,725
YEAH, OH, YEAH.

95
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,561
IF THEY LOWERED THEM ANY MORE,
MAYBE YOU WOULD HAVE GOT ON.

96
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,097
(Laughing)

97
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:55,168
(Red): WE'RE GONNA HAVE
"ADVENTURES WITH BILL",

98
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,937
GONNA DO SOME GO-KARTING...
SOMETHIN' ABOUT MEN AND CARS.

99
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,408
I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE
GOTTEN OUT OF THE KART.

100
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,644
BILL'S GOT THE GAS GOIN'
AND I SHOULD HAVE GONE

101
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:05,812
WITH THE SELF-SERVE.

102
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,014
I'M GETTIN' SOAKED, BILL.

103
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,082
GAS ALL OVER EVERYTHING.

104
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:10,650
WE'RE ALL SET TO GO.

105
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,584
GET THE FUNNEL OUT, BILL.

106
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,621
YEAH, MIGHT BE SOME GAS
IN THERE.

107
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:15,989
MIGHT WANT TO DRY THAT OFF.

108
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:16,756
DON'T JUST START 'ER.

109
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,057
GOTTA DRY THAT OFF.

110
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,959
DON'T JUST START IT.

111
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,361
BILL, IT'S NOT SAFE.

112
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,629
OH, IT'S FINE?

113
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:27,634
(Bill): AHHHHH!

114
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,236
(Red): EZEKIEL SAW
A WHEEL A-ROLLING

115
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:31,938
WAY IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE AIR

116
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,309
OHHHHH

117
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,177
I LIKE TO GO OUT
AFTER DARK

118
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,013
AND FIRE MY GUN
JUST FOR A LARK

119
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:43,216
IT'S A HOBBY MOST OTHER
FOLKS FIND STRANGE

120
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,718
BUT I LIKE
THE MYSTERIOUS THRILL I GOT

121
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,787
NEVER KNOWING
EXACTLY WHAT I SHOT

122
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,521
EXCEPT FOR THAT TIME

123
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,024
I FORGOT TO PARK MY VAN
OUT OF RANGE

124
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:55,928
THIS IS FOR THE BIG ONE!

125
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:58,331
TWO HOURS OF HYDROTHERAPY
AT ERNIE'S CAR WASH!

126
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,799
YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS

127
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,035
TO GET MR. WINSTON ROTHSCHILD
TO SAY THIS WORD...

128
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,970
SUICIDE.

129
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:05,838
AND GO!

130
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:07,874
ALL RIGHT, UH...

131
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:08,775
DEPRESSION.

132
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,544
(Ringing bell)

133
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,547
DEPRESSION.
SEPTIC HOLE.

134
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,616
MMM... SAD.

135
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,418
EMPTY SEPTIC HOLE.

136
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:23,089
IF YOU WENT DOWN STINKY
PETERSON'S OUTHOUSE, THAT'S...

137
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,325
... FIFTY BUCKS, PLUS TIP.

138
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,860
(Laughing)

139
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,062
WHAT'S
THAT GUY'S NAME?

140
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,797
UM... UMM...
KEVORKIAN.

141
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:31,497
SELF-HELP.

142
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,133
(Laughing)

143
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,736
UM, HARA KIRI.

144
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:37,970
CHICAGO CUBS.

145
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,140
NOT THE
ANNOUNCER.
WHAT ANNOUNCER?

146
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,377
FLYING WITH BUZZ SHERWOOD.

147
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:45,445
OH, SUICIDE.

148
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,713
(Ringing bell)

149
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:47,814
YES!

150
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,116
(Applause)

151
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,518
BET YOU NEVER THOUGHT

152
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,655
YOU'D SEE ME THROWING OUT
OLD RECORD ALBUMS.

153
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:58,891
TECHNOLOGY CHANGES -- YOU GOTTA
KEEP UP WITH THE TIMES.

154
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:02,261
I'M SWITCHIN' TO THAT NEW
AUDIO SYSTEM -- EIGHT-TRACKS.

155
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,064
I THREW OUT THE COVERS,
NOT THE ALBUMS.

156
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,934
THIS WEEK ON "HANDYMAN CORNER",
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU

157
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,169
WHAT YOU CAN DO
WITH YOUR OLD RECORDS.

158
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:13,539
THROWIN' ANYTHING OUT
BECAUSE IT'S OLD AND WON'T PLAY

159
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,542
IS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT
FOR ANYBODY OVER 40.

160
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,412
INSTEAD, I'M GONNA SHOW YOU

161
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,148
HOW YOU CAN TURN MUSIC RECORDS
INTO OLYMPIC RECORDS,

162
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,816
AND NOT JUST FOR DISCUS.

163
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:26,152
(Glass
breaking)

164
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,687
JEFFERSON AIRPLANE
COULD REALLY FLY.

165
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,323
DRILL THE CENTRE OUT

166
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,091
AND YOU CAN USE 'EM
FOR LIFTING WEIGHTS.

167
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,530
YOU SLIDE THEM DOWN
THE END OF YOUR BAR

168
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,566
AND, ACTUALLY,
IF YOU'RE REALLY OUT OF SHAPE,

169
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,235
YOU MIGHT WANT TO START
WITH THE 45's.

170
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:44,237
THEN YOU JUST PICK THEM UP.

171
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,672
(Grunting)

172
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,375
THESE ARE HEAVY
WHEN THEY'RE ALL TOGETHER...

173
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,510
KIND OF LIKE RELATIVES.

174
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,745
(Grunting)

175
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,747
MUST BE SOME HEAVY METAL
IN THERE.

176
00:06:56,048 --> 00:07:00,219
(Grunting)

177
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:01,988
BOY, IT'S IRONIC, EH?

178
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,257
THE MUSIC THAT MADE
YOUR PARENTS SICK

179
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,458
IS GONNA MAKE YOU HEALTHY.

180
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,360
(Grunting)

181
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:09,562
OH, FOR GOSH SAKES.

182
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,531
"JAMES LAST AND HIS ORCHESTRA."

183
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,032
BOY, WE KNEW HOW TO PARTY.

184
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,902
(Grunting)

185
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:19,439
SEEMS A SHAME TO BE
THROWIN' OUT GOOD PLASTIC

186
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,607
WHEN YOU COULD BE USING IT
TO GIVE YOUR CAR

187
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,010
A SECOND CHANCE
AND ANOTHER 100,000 MILES.

188
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:27,246
I'LL TELL YOU,
ALBUMS DON'T RUST,

189
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,915
NO MATTER WHAT NEIL YOUNG SAYS.

190
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,716
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE

191
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:32,919
YOU'RE NOT BURNING UP
A COLLECTOR'S ITEM.

192
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,021
THIS COULD BE WORTH
A FAIR AMOUNT OF MONEY.

193
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:38,257
"PAT BOONE --
SHAKE, SHIMMY AND ROLL."

194
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,592
NO, WE'RE SAFE.

195
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,700
THE BEST USE OF ALBUMS
IS ON THE ROOF.

196
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,968
THEY'RE THICK,
THEY'RE WATERPROOF,

197
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,236
THEY'RE THE SAME SIZE,

198
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,405
AND BEST OF ALL,
YOU ONLY NEED ONE NAIL.

199
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,374
LOOK WHAT I GOT HERE.

200
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:56,476
ED AMES...

201
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,411
DORIS DAY, "EASTER A-GO-GO"...

202
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,080
"SOUNDS OF RIO '68"...

203
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,016
"FRAMPTON LIVE"...

204
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:07,854
MAN, THERE'S ENOUGH OF THEM
AROUND TO RE-DO A SUBDIVISION.

205
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:14,527
A ROOF LIKE THIS IS GONNA LAST
MORE THAN A FEW YEARS.

206
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:15,862
MIGHT EVEN BREAK A RECORD.

207
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:19,131
WHE THESE WEAR OUT,
FLIP 'EM TO THE "B" SIDE.

208
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:22,235
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

209
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,736
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

210
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,507
"MOMS AND DADS"...

00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,177
"THE HOLLYRIDGE STRINGS
DO THE BEATLES"...

213
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,314
WOW, THE SOUNDTRACK
FROM "LOVE STORY".

214
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:36,682
BERNICE MUST HAVE BOUGHT
THAT ONE.

215
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,685
"ACCORDION FAVOURITES"!

216
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,320
THAT BABY DESERVES
AN EXTRA NAIL.

217
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:46,092
STAY TUNED -- WHATEVER THIS IS,
WE GOT LOTS MORE OF IT.

218
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,398
I WANTED TO ASK YOU GUYS
ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS.

219
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,701
HAVE YOU NOTICED HOW
THEY'RE STARTIN' TO LOOK OLD?

220
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,605
I KNOW THEY'RE THE SAME AGE
AS YOU,

221
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:03,042
BUT YOU STILL HAVE
YOUR YOUTHFUL VITALITY, WHEREAS

222
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,578
THEY'VE STARTED SAGGING,
DRAGGING, AND SADDLE-BAGGING.

223
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:08,414
(Laughing)

224
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:11,250
NOW, YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING
IF YOU SHOULD TELL THEM

225
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,085
THAT THEY LOOK LIKE
DEATH EATING A CRACKER.

226
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,622
YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T.

227
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,858
SURE, YOU LOOK TERRIFIC

228
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,159
AND YOU HAVE SOME AUTHORITY
IN THAT AREA,

229
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,428
BUT YOU'LL FIND THAT
EVEN YOUR BEST FRIENDS,

230
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:26,232
CONFRONTED WITH AN UGLY TRUTH,
CAN BE UNGRATEFUL.

231
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,101
THEY MAY MENTION
YOUR GREY HAIR.

232
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,836
IT'S NOT AS GREY AS THEIRS

233
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,205
AND WHEN YOU COMB IT
OVER YOUR BALD SPOT,

234
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,273
YOU LOOK AS YOUNG AS ANYBODY

235
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,008
WHO COMBS IT
OVER THEIR BALD SPOT.

236
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,313
INSTEAD, COMPLIMENT
YOUR FRIENDS

237
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,714
ON HOW GOOD THEY LOOK.

238
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:44,417
I'M BETTIN' THEY'LL DO
THE SAME THING TO YOU.

239
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,987
NOBODY NEEDS TO KNOW THAT
AT LEAST ONE OF YOU IS LYING...

240
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,822
ESPECIALLY YOU.

241
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,924
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

242
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,826
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

243
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:57,296
(Applause)

244
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:01,400
WELL, HAROLD HAD
HIS FIRST BASEBALL GAME.

245
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,736
MAN, THAT WAS HARD TO WATCH.

246
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:07,073
NA-NA, NA-NA-NA-NA

247
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,908
HEY-Y-Y-Y

248
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,910
GOOD RIDDANCE

249
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:16,415
(Audience laughing)

250
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:17,683
NICE GAME,
HAROLD.

251
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,586
YEAH, I FELT COMFORTABLE
OUT THERE TODAY!

252
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,788
I HAD THE GOOD STUFF, HUH?

253
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,358
I HAD REAL MOVEMENT
ON THE FASTBALL

254
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,027
AND I WAS GETTIN'
THE BREAKING-BALL OVER.

255
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,563
EVEN WHEN I WAS BEHIND
IN THE COUNT... AHHH!

256
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,699
I NEVER HAD A NO-HITTER BEFORE.

257
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,034
I NEVER
HAD ONE.

258
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,303
NOT TECHNICALLY
A NO-HITTER, HAROLD.

259
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,838
YOU BEANED FOUR GUYS.

260
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,941
NO, NO, NO, THAT WAS
THE MANAGER'S FAULT.

261
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,443
HE SENT ME IN
WITHOUT MY GLASSES.

262
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:46,512
WASN'T EASY ON ME, EITHER.

263
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:47,980
I WASTED FIVE
OF MY BEST PITCHES

264
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,016
THROWING TO THE SHORTSTOP.

265
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,519
WELL, HAROLD, YOU KNOW,
I GOTTA--

266
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,388
YOU WON-- I GOTTA HAND IT--

267
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,756
GOOD, THAT WAS GOOD.

268
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,357
WELL DONE, THAT'S GOOD.

269
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:01,027
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT --
THAT'S GOOD.

270
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,728
(Audience laughing)

271
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,797
DO YOU MISS
NOT PLAYING?

272
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,132
NOT AT ALL, HAROLD.

273
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,369
I WAS OUT OF MY MIND.

274
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:13,773
I WON'T HAVE TIME TO COME
TO GAMES TO EVEN WATCH.

275
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,141
NO, I DON'T
THINK SO.

276
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:18,444
OK, I'LL TELL THE GUY
NOT TO MAKE AS MANY HOT DOGS.

277
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,414
WE'LL PROBABLY GET
MORE FAMILIES SHOWING UP

278
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:24,083
WITH YOU NOT BEING THERE,
USING ALL THAT TRASH-TALK

279
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,185
AND THROWING WRAPPERS
ON THE FIELD.

280
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,921
I CAN DO THAT ANYWHERE.
TRUE.

281
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,556
JUST REMEMBER, NOW.

282
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:33,859
IF ANYBODY CALLS YOU
A NO-GOOD BUM, DON'T FORGET...

283
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,994
I TOLD YOU FIRST.

284
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:38,464
(Laughing)

285
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,738
YOU CAN SEE, IN THOSE TERMS,
WHY, TO WOMEN,

286
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,440
MOVIES HAVE TO HAVE MORE

287
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,275
THAN GUYS MACHINE-GUNNING
EACH OTHER.

288
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,311
OK, WHO ELSE WOULD LIKE
TO SHARE WITH THE GROUP?

289
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,147
OH, BUZZ!

290
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,817
HI, I'M BUZZ, AND I'M A MAN.

291
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,151
(All): HI, BUZZ!

292
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:02,455
I THINK I HAD
A BREAKTHROUGH LAST NIGHT.

293
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:06,258
I WAS SITTING AT HOME,
WATCHING TELEVISION.

294
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,327
THE SWAMP BUGGY RACES WERE ON.

295
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,996
I WAS MINDIN' MY OWN BUSINESS
AND SHE COMES HOME.

296
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,898
I KNOW RIGHT AWAY
SOMETHING'S WRONG

297
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,434
'CAUSE SHE'S SIGHING
AND SHE'S STOMPING.

298
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,603
YOU KNOW,
THE STOMP-STOMP-STOMP...

299
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:18,904
(Sighing)

300
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,539
STOMP-STOMP-STOMP-STOMP...

301
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,742
(Sighing)

302
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:27,446
SO, EVENTUALLY, I SAT UP,
I MUTED THE T.V.,

303
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,449
AND I SAID, "WHAT?"

304
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,518
(Red): YEAH.

305
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,586
(Harold): VERY GOOD!

306
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,187
ALL RIGHT!

307
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,792
SO THEN SHE STARTS UNLOADING
ON ME ABOUT HER FAMILY

308
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:43,429
AND HER SISTER'S SO-CALLED
DANCING CAREER, RIGHT?

309
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,232
I'M THINKIN',
"I GOTTA BOOK SOME TALENT

310
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,868
"'CAUSE WE'VE GOT
A HOCKEY BANQUET COMIN' UP!"

311
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,336
(Audience laughing)

312
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,671
AND THEN I REALIZED, YOU KNOW?

313
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:54,206
WHILE THEY'RE TALKING TO YOU,

314
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,175
YOU CAN BE THINKING
ABOUT OTHER STUFF!

315
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,543
THEY DON'T KNOW!

316
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,713
SO SHE'S TALKIN'
AND I'M THINKIN',

317
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,915
"I GOTTA FILL THOSE HOLES
ON THE PLANE."

318
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:06,418
THEN I PLAYED THE ENTIRE FIRST
SIDE OF "LED ZEPPELIN 3".

319
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:10,489
I'M SITTIN' ON THE COUCH
AND I'M NODDIN' MY HEAD.

320
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,925
SHE THINKS I'M AGREEING
WITH HER BUT I'M NOT!

321
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,594
I'M JAMMIN' WITH JIMMY
ON "THE IMMIGRANT SONG"!

322
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:19,298
(Imitating rock music)

323
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,234
AHHHHHH

324
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,270
(Imitating rock music)

325
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,771
HEY, HEY, HEY!

326
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,773
YEAH, YEAH, HEY, HEY!

327
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:32,278
(Laughing and applause)

328
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,282
SO SHE'S DONE
ALL THIS TALKING, RIGHT?

329
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:37,583
SHE FEELS BETTER,

330
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,686
AND I'VE FIGURED OUT
HOW TO RE-WIRE THE BASEMENT.

331
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:41,453
I'VE REMEMBERED

332
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:44,657
WHERE MY BASEBALL GLOVE WAS,
AND I NAMED ALL THE BRADYS.

333
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,393
BOBBY -- THAT'S THE ONE
WE COULDN'T REMEMBER.

334
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:50,963
SO I CAN HARDLY WAIT
TILL SHE WANTS TO TALK AGAIN.

335
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:54,567
THEN I'LL GET
MY BEST THINKING DONE!

336
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,135
THANK YOU.

337
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,605
THANK YOU, BUZZ.

338
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,542
(Red): WELL, HANG ON
TO YOUR TESTOSTERONE.

339
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,411
TODAY ON "ADVENTURES
WITH BILL",

340
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:06,679
WE'RE GOING GO-KARTING.

341
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,647
I DON'T THINK
YOU EVER OUTGROW THAT.

342
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:10,082
WE'RE MAKING IT SAFER.

343
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,617
WE GOT THE TRUCK TIRES.

344
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,118
WE NEEDED A FEW MORE TIRES.

345
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,489
THESE ARE SMALLER
BUT THEY'LL WORK FINE, BILL.

346
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:18,991
WE NEEDED FOUR MORE.

347
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,993
WHERE DID YOU GET THESE, BILL?

348
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,595
WHERE DID YOU GET THESE?

349
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,563
WHERE DID YOU GET THESE TIRES?

350
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,999
OHHHH!

351
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,068
GREAT.

352
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:29,802
NO, THAT'S GREAT.

353
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,804
WE THOUGHT WE'D MAKE IT
A RACE...

354
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:35,507
SOMETHING ABOUT US GUYS
WHO LIKE COMPETITION.

355
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,276
BILL'S WAVING THE GREEN FLAG.

356
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,310
I MIGHT AS WELL GO.

357
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,380
A LITTLE ADVANTAGE --
WHAT THE HECK, EH?

358
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,816
HE'S GOT THE FASTER KART --
THAT'S ONLY FAIR.

359
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,319
YOUR MIND GOES BACK
TO WHEN YOU WERE A KID

360
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,421
ON THE SIDEWALK
ON YOUR BIG WHEEL,

361
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,624
RUNNIN' OVER SMALL ANIMALS.

362
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,159
I'M WAY AHEAD, THERE.

363
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,028
I GO INTO THE HAIRPIN TURN.

364
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,564
BILL SORT OF GOES
INTO THE HAIRPIN TURN

365
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,900
BUT HE TURNS IT
INTO A BOBBY-PIN TURN...

366
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,368
LOOK AT THAT -- THAT'S NOT...

367
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:03,936
BILL, THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE.

368
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:08,474
FOR ME, IT EXPLAINED THAT
WE CAN LIFT SOME RULES ON THIS.

369
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:09,608
IF I WANT TO GO ONE WAY,

370
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:10,876
IF I WANT TO KNOCK HIM
ANOTHER WAY,

371
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,244
IF I WANT TO DO
WHATEVER I HAVE TO DO...

372
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,480
IT'S NOT IF YOU WIN
OR YOU LOSE...

373
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:18,517
IT'S IF YOU WIN!

374
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:20,886
OH, THERE YOU GO.

375
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:23,489
ALL RIGHT,
HE'S CATCHING UP AGAIN.

376
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,991
HEY, HOW ABOUT
A LITTLE MORE OF THE SAME?

377
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:27,092
EH, BILL? HUH?

378
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,295
IT'S NOT DANGEROUS,
BY GOLLY -- THESE CARS

379
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,429
NEVER FLIP OVER.

380
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:34,266
YOU GOT THOSE TIRES,
SOME NICE TIRES TO PROTECT YOU.

381
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,201
LOOK OUT, NOW, BILL.

382
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,202
BE CAREFUL, YOUNG FELLA.

383
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:39,271
BY GOSH, HE'S LOSING CONTROL --
WHAT A SHAME.

384
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,808
I'M DOING WELL NOW --
HANG ON, BILL!

385
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,977
YOU'RE GONNA--
YOU MAY HIT THIS WALL.

386
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:48,580
YEAH, DON'T THINK
I'LL SEE MUCH OF HIM.

387
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,216
BOY, HE LOOKS TIRED.

388
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:52,051
ALL RIGHT!

389
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,919
IF THAT'S HOW
YOU WANT TO PLAY...

390
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:54,753
UP TO THE FINISH LINE.

391
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:57,756
THE RACE ISN'T OVER TILL
THE FAT GUY WAVES THE FLAG.

392
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,825
NOT YET -- THERE'S YOUR WINNER!

393
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:00,726
THERE'S YOUR WINNER.

394
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,830
THAT MAKES YOU A LOSER, BILL.

395
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,564
WHY DON'T YOU PROVE IT?

396
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:07,800
PERFECT!

397
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:11,704
HERE'S A NIFTY RED GREEN
"BORED" GAME

398
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,006
SENT TO US BY OUR PAL,
CHUCKY MORGAN.

399
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:14,807
THANKS, CHUCKY.

400
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:24,183
SORRY, HAROLD.

401
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:24,917
IT'S OK!

402
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:26,819
YOU ALL RIGHT?

403
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:30,322
GOOD NEWS -- THEY NEED YOU BACK
ON THE BASEBALL TEAM!

404
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,924
REALLY, HAROLD? REALLY?

405
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,359
YOU DIDN'T BEG THEM
TO GET ME ON?

406
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,194
NO... NO, NOT REALLY.

407
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,864
I DON'T WANT YOU BEGGING
ON MY BEHALF.

408
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,367
YOU'LL NEED ALL YOUR BEGGING
FOR YOUR OWN PURPOSES.

409
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,702
NO, THERE WAS
AN INJURY.

410
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:46,739
I SUGGESTED YOU AND THEY SAID,
"HE'S A NATURAL."

411
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:50,876
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
I MAY HAVE LOST A STEP OR TWO.

412
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,145
IF YOU USE ME RIGHT, EH?

413
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:54,480
WE'RE GONNA!

414
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,482
ALL RIGHT,
DESIGNATED HITTER, MAYBE?

415
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:57,583
NOTHING LIKE THAT, BUT COME ON!

416
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,851
YOUR UNIFORM'S IN THE VAN!

417
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:00,719
FIRST BASE?
NO! NO!

418
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:01,420
SECOND BASE?
NOOOO!

419
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,755
SHORTSTOP?
NO, NO, NO!

420
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,157
RIGHT FIELD?
NO!

421
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,059
I'M ON THE FIELD?
OK, YEAH! OK!

422
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:11,797
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT PORTION,

423
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,899
WHERE WE EXAMINE
THOSE THREE LITTLE WORDS

424
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:15,968
THAT MEN FIND
SO DIFFICULT TO SAY.

425
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,337
(Audience):
"I DON'T KNOW!"

426
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,705
AHHHH

427
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,141
JOINING MY UNCLE RED
ON THE EXPERT PORTION

428
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,776
IS HIS BEST FRIEND--

429
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,712
OH, OK -- INSTEAD,
IT'S MR. ARNIE DOGAN!

430
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:30,616
(Applause)

431
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:31,617
ALL
RIGHTY-ROOSKY!

432
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,719
TODAY'S LETTER GOES AS FOLLOWS.

433
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,455
"DEAR EXPERTS, MY MOTHER
IS AN EXOTIC DANCER,

434
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,724
"AS IS MY GRANDMOTHER
AND MY AUNTS.

435
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:42,027
"THERE'S PRESSURE ON ME
TO BECOME AN EXOTIC DANCER

436
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,295
"AND CARRY ON
THE FAMILY BUSINESS.

437
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:46,465
"I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO --
SIGNED, BOB."

438
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:50,269
(Laughing)

439
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,404
ALL RIGHT, UH... BOB.

440
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,240
I HAVEN'T SEEN A PICTURE
OF YOU, NOR DO I WANT TO.

441
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:57,009
BUT, UH...

442
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:57,943
I WOULD ADVISE YOU

443
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:00,446
TO ABSTAIN FROM EXOTIC DANCING
AS HARD AS YOU CAN.

444
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,382
I WOULD ADVISE
YOU GET INTO FOLK-DANCING

445
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,450
OR TAP-DANCING OR...

446
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,885
I'M EVEN THINKING
NUCLEAR MEDICINE AT THIS POINT.

447
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,656
IF YOU DON'T MIND ME SAYING,

448
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,725
I THINK THERE'S A LOT
TO BE SAID

449
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:15,327
FOR GOING INTO
THE FAMILY BUSINESS.

450
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,996
MY GRANDPA STARTED
DOGAN AND SONS ROOFING,

451
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,898
AND MY DAD WORKS THERE
AND SO DO I.

452
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,468
I HOPE MAYBE SOMEDAY,
MY SON WILL, TOO.

453
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:25,204
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD A SON.

454
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,872
NOT YET -- ONE DAY, HOPEFULLY.

455
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,875
AFTER THE CAST COMES OFF,
THE DOCTORS WILL TELL ME

456
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,344
IF I STILL HAVE A CHANCE
OF HAVING CHILDREN.

457
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,347
JEEZ!

458
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:36,281
MORE THAN
I NEEDED TO KNOW.

459
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,685
CAN'T BELIEVE THIS, ARNIE.

460
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:42,387
YOU'VE HAD MORE INJURIES
THAN A ROLLER DERBY RAP PARTY.

461
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:44,022
AND, UH...

462
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:46,758
YOU'RE STILL ADVISING PEOPLE
TO GET INTO A FAMILY BUSINESS.

463
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,162
THERE'S A LOT OF PLUSES, RED.

464
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,998
BY BEING FAMILY,
WE SHARE A LOT.

465
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:56,168
YOU KNOW, UH... SAME ATTITUDE,
SAME WORK HABITS,

466
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,103
SAME RARE BLOOD TYPE --
THAT'S COME IN HANDY.

467
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,207
YOU GET TO KNOW THE PEOPLE.

468
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,710
THE ROOFING SUPPLIERS,
THE TRADESMEN,

469
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,978
THE AMBULANCE DRIVERS...

470
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,347
IT'S LIKE THEY ALL BECOME
PART OF THE FAMILY.

471
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,916
YOU'RE NOT ONE TO TALK,
UNCLE RED.

472
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,551
YOU BROUGHT ME
INTO THE FAMILY BUSINESS.

473
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:14,753
YOU ON HIS SIDE OR MY SIDE?

474
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:17,556
YOU KNOW,

475
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,160
YOU REALLY NEED A COUNTRY SONG
TO DESCRIBE

476
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,994
HOW YOU FEEL.

477
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,862
NO, YOU DON'T!
I THINK YOU DO.

478
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:27,966
HERE'S ONE THAT I WROTE
WHILE A TEAM OF DOCTORS

479
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:30,035
WERE TRYING TO REMOVE
PARTS OF A CHINESE ELM

480
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,303
FROM MY LARGE INTESTINE.

481
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,806
(Audience laughing)

482
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,175
WHY DOES HE
DO THAT?

483
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,309
IT WILL BE A HIGH ONE.

484
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,645
(Audience laughing)

485
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:45,050
MY DADDY WAS A ROOFER

486
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,020
JUST LIKE HIS DADDY WAS

487
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:53,058
AND I'M A ROOFER TOO

488
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,196
SAME AS MY DADDY, BUT TALLER.

489
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,166
WE WORK ALL DAY
TOGETHER ON THE ROOF

490
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:04,503
ROOFING ALL THE DAY

491
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,004
IT'S HARD WORK

492
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:09,741
AND IT DOESN'T PAY
WORTH A DAMN

493
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,878
BUT MY DADDY COULD NEVER

494
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,379
FIRE ME

495
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:19,985
BECAUSE MY MOM-M-M-M-M

496
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,420
WOULD KILL HIM

497
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:27,259
(Applause)

498
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:33,365
I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO HUMILIATED
IN ALL MY LIFE!

499
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:37,102
UNCLE RED, COME IN
AND TELL THEM WHAT YOU DID!

500
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:38,537
YOU GO AHEAD, HAROLD.

501
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:39,771
YOU WRAP UP THE SHOW.

502
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:42,374
NO, I DON'T THINK SO!

503
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,309
COME OUT AND TELL THEM
WHAT YOU DID!

504
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:49,915
(Laughing and cheering)

505
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,483
TELL 'EM.

506
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:54,486
(Applause and cheering)

507
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,154
TELL THEM WHAT YOU DID!

508
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:57,022
I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT.

509
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,323
YOU WANT ME TO TELL THEM?

510
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:00,859
ALL RIGHT, WELL...

511
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:04,463
BEING THE MASCOT
WAS THE LAST THING ON MY MIND

512
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,698
SO I DIDN'T START OFF
IN A GREAT MOOD.

513
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,302
I GET YOU ON THE TEAM
AND THIS IS THE THANKS I GET.

514
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,805
THE OTHER MASCOT STARTED IT.

515
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:16,408
YOU HEARD WHAT HE CALLED YOU?
YOU CALL ME THAT!

516
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,043
I'M FAMILY, ALL RIGHT?

517
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,846
I WAS DEFENDING
THE TEAM'S HONOUR.

518
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:23,949
I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS
A
 PAPIER MACHE
 HEAD.

519
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,984
THINK OF THE MESSAGE
YOU'RE SENDING

520
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,686
TO THOSE YOUNG FANS OUT THERE.

521
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,321
A GIANT BEAR AND A PARROT,

522
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,189
LEG-WRESTLING
AT THE PITCHER'S MOUND!

523
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:35,761
IT WAS THE PLAYERS' IDEA
TO JOIN IN!

524
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,363
WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER
BECAUSE THE SEASON'S OVER.

525
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:42,034
NOT UNTIL DOCTORS REMOVE THE
BASEBALL FROM BUSTER HADFIELD.

526
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,336
NO, I MEAN ME --
IT'S ALL OVER, ANYWAY.

527
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,338
IT'S ALL VIOLENCE
AND ANIMALS FIGHTING...

528
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:47,939
I GOT SCARED --
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY.

529
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,211
IF IT MEANS ANYTHING,
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

530
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:54,880
YOU'RE A REAL BABE RUTH.

531
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:56,915
AWWWW!

532
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:59,318
THANK YOU.

533
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,585
I MEAN THE CHOCOLATE BAR,
HAROLD.

534
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:05,157
YOU'RE SOFT AND GOOEY
AND HALF-NUTS.

535
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,826
(Possum squeal)

536
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:08,827
MEETING TIME.

537
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,295
(Laughing)

538
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:12,931
YOU GO AHEAD, HAROLD --
I'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.

539
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:16,735
(Laughing)

540
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:17,869
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

541
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,471
I'M COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

542
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:22,974
I'M THINKING MAYBE IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO PUT AWAY MY CLEATS...

543
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:24,876
AND YOUR PYJAMAS.

544
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:28,246
HEY, I'M NOT GIVING UP
ALL CONTACT SPORTS!

545
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:30,982
THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

546
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:35,787
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND OLD HAROLD AND THE GANG,

547
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:36,822
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

548
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:41,793
(Applause and cheering)

549
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:48,066
(Possum squeal)

550
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,168
(Red): ALL RIGHT.

551
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,837
(Harold): ALL RISE!

552
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:52,938
ALL RISE!

553
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:54,539
(Red): ALL RIGHT.

554
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,812
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

555
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,614
(Red): SIT DOWN --
HAROLD, YOU GOT, UH...

556
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:04,616
(Harold): THE BRANIGAN

557
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:06,017
FOOD DRIVE WENT WELL.

558
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:08,086
THEY SAY THANKS
FOR THE SUPPLIES.

559
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:09,421
ALTHOUGH THEY REALIZE

560
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:10,122
THEIR KIDS ARE BRATS,

561
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:10,689
THEY DIDN'T THINK

562
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,290
THE PAINT CHIPS AND SALSA

563
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,258
WAS A GOOD IDEA.
