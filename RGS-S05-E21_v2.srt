00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:10,310
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

4
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:13,113
HERE'S A MAN
WHO'S A LITTLE BIT COUNTRY,

5
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:16,282
A LITTLE BIT CITY,
AND A GREAT DEAL OF BOG...

6
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,619
MY UNCLE, YOUR HOST, RED GREEN!

7
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,421
WAHOO!!

10
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,129
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

11
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,630
THANK YOU, UH...

12
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,332
HAD A BIT OF A CLOSE CALL

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,067
BUT WE'RE OKEY-DOKEY NOW.

14
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:35,502
STINKY PETERSON AND I

15
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,504
WERE JUST OUT FISHING, THERE,

16
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,707
WHERE THE POSSUM LODGE
SEWER OUTLET COMES DOWN.

17
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:44,010
BOTH OF US LOOKED AWAY
AT EXACTLY THE SAME MOMENT

18
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:47,614
AND EIGHT MILLION GALLONS
OF WHATEVER COME DOWN THERE

19
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,150
AND KNOCKED US OUT OF THE BOAT
INTO THE LAKE.

20
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,551
WE'RE OK NOW.

21
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:55,021
WOW! WERE YOU KILLED?

22
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:57,157
[audience laughing]

23
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,859
DO I LOOK LIKE I WAS KILLED?

24
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:01,828
YEAH.

25
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,596
I BET YOU WERE SCARED.

26
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:06,099
YOU MUST HAVE SCREAMED, LIKE...

27
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,601
AHHHHHH! AHHHHH!

28
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:10,603
DID YOU SCREAM LIKE "OHHHH"?

29
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,106
THEN YOU GET WATER
AND YOU GO "AHHHH!"

30
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:16,609
DID YOUR LIFE FLASH
BEFORE YOUR EYES?

31
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:18,611
IT IS NOW!

32
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:20,914

00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:39,265
(Red): I'M GONNA MAKE
A LIFEJACKET OUT OF JELLY.

37
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,267
AND RANGER GORD GETS

38
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,269
SOME SPECIAL BADGES.

39
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:47,273
DALTON LOOKS FOR THE MISSING
WORD AROUND HERE: "JOB".

40
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,875
AND HAROLD TRIES...

41
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,077
WELL, I GUESS THAT'S RAP.

42
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,719
THERE, THAT'S BETTER.

43
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,421
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN SCARED

44
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,957
WHEN YOU SAW THAT WATER
COMING AT YOU.

45
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,458
I SCREAMED TO STINKY.

46
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:08,328
I SAID, "IF GOD GETS US
OUT OF THIS ONE,

47
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,363
"I'LL NEVER MISS CHURCH AGAIN."

48
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,798
THIS HAND LIFTED ME UP

49
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,601
AND I SAW A TUNNEL
WITH A LIGHT AT THE END.

50
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,669
I WAS MOVING TOWARDS THE LIGHT.

51
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:19,005
WOW! UNCLE RED, YOU HAD

52
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:22,642
AN OUTER-BODY
NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE!

53
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,144
YES! OH, YES, YES!

54
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,714
I HEARD ABOUT THESE ON JOJO'S
PSYCHIC ALLIANCE HOTLINE.

55
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,115
YEAH! OH!

56
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,783
YOU FELT THE HAND OF GOD.

57
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,219
YOU SAW THE GATEWAY
TO THE AFTERLIFE.

58
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,021
I FELT MOOSE THOMPSON'S HAND.

59
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,789
I SAW POSSUM LODGE'S SEWER.

60
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,459
I WALKED OUT --
I'M FINE, HAROLD.

61
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:42,228
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU
AT CHURCH.

62
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,464
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

63
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,000
YOU SAID IF GOD SAVED YOU,
YOU'D GO TO CHURCH.

64
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,435
GOD DIDN'T SAVE ME --
MOOSE DID.

65
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,870
COME ON,
UNCLE RED.

66
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,039
MOOSE WAS MERELY
GOD'S TOOL.

67
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,675
MOOSE IS EVERYBODY'S TOOL,
HAROLD.

68
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,243
NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

69
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,845
YOU GOTTA GO
TO CHURCH.

70
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,446
YOU GOTTA GO
TO CHURCH.

71
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,182
IF YOU DON'T,
YOU'LL TURN

72
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,684
INTO A PILLAR
OF SALT OR SOMETHING.

73
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,719
HAROLD, YOU DO GO TO CHURCH.

74
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:08,688
LOOK WHAT YOU TURNED INTO.

75
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,190
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES.

76
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,525
[applause]

77
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,427
(Red): GOT A TREAT FOR YOU.

78
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,663
AWAY YOU GO, BILL, UP AND OVER.

79
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,698
OHHHHH... MAN!

80
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,200
OW! OW!

81
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:23,036
LATER, WE'LL HAVE
MARTIAL ARTS FROM BILL,

82
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,471
BUT FIRST,
THERE'S A LITTLE TEASER,

83
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,106
A LITTLE DEMONSTRATION.

84
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:30,109
HE'S GONNA DO
A LITTLE FOREHEAD "FU", HERE,

85
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,711
I BELIEVE THIS IS CALLED.

86
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:34,714
IT'S KIND OF
LUMBER AGAINST LUMBER.

87
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:38,184
UNFORTUNATELY, BILL'S GOT
THE SOFT WOOD.

88
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,320
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT PORTION.

89
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,823
THIS WEEK, WE HAVE TWO EXPERTS,
ONE BEING UNCLE RED

90
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,392
AND HIS FRIEND,
MR. DALTON HUMPHREY.

91
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:50,463
[applause]

92
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,567
THIS WEEK'S LETTER
GOES AS FOLLOWS:

93
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,502
"DEAR EXPERTS" -- WAHHH! --

94
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,372
"MY WIFE AND I ARE GOING
THROUGH A DIVORCE...

95
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,873
"FROM EACH OTHER.

96
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,942
"HOW CAN WE DIVIDE STUFF

97
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:07,247
"WHEN WE ONLY HAVE
ONE GOOD PIECE OF FURNITURE?"

98
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:10,516
WELL, THE PHRASE "CHAINSAW"
COMES TO MIND.

99
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,119
YOU KNOW, THAT'S
A TOUGH PROBLEM.

100
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,788
I KNOW, 'CAUSE
ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO,

101
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,191
MY WIFE AND I DECIDED
TO DIVORCE.

102
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:22,128
WHAT?! YOU AND ANNE-MARIE
ARE GETTING DIVORCED, ARE YOU?

103
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,230
SHE WANTED TO WAIT
TILL OUR DAUGHTER WAS 20,

104
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:28,034
AND THAT HAPPENED LAST MONTH,
SO AFTER, UH...

105
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,604
AFTER 14 YEARS OF MARRIAGE,
SHE MOVED OUT.

106
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,706
[audience laughing]

107
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,642
WALKED RIGHT OUT.

108
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,777
SORRY TO HEAR THAT,
MR. HUMPHREY.

109
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,279
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

110
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,780
THAT IS HER LOSS.

111
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:44,117
YOU'LL FIND OUT THAT YOU'RE
GONNA BE THE LUCKY ONE NOW.

112
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:45,785
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.

113
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,421
MOST FOLKS AROUND HERE
NEVER LIKED HER.

114
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,423
[audience laughing]

115
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,991
YOU'D HEAR 'EM SAYING,

116
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,694
"BOY, HOW DID HE END UP
WITH THAT ONE?"

117
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,896
"HE'D BE BETTER OFF
WITHOUT HER.

118
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,665
"SHE'S HOLDING HIM BACK."

119
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,066
SO DON'T YOU WORRY.

120
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,603
I HAD NO IDEA
THAT FOLKS FELT THAT WAY.

121
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,339
THEY JUST COULDN'T STAND
THE SIGHT OF HER.

122
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,275
WHEN THEY FIND OUT
THIS THING HAS GONE KAPUT,

123
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,577
THERE'S GONNA BE
A BIG CELEBRATION.

124
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,747
I WONDER HOW THEY'LL FEEL
WHEN THEY FIND OUT

125
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,116
THAT SHE'S COME BACK
AFTER A WEEK

126
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,553
AND WE RECONCILED,
DECIDED WE LOVED EACH OTHER.

127
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,692
[audience laughing]

128
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,193
[applause]

129
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,695
WELL...

130
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:30,697
[clearing throat]

131
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:34,200
JUST OFF THE TOP
OF MY HEAD, I...

132
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,370
I WOULD IMAGINE
THEY'D BE SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED

133
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,806
ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS
THEY'D SAID

134
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,408
AND I WOULD-- I WOULD--
I WOULD EXPECT

135
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,912
THAT THEY WOULD OWE YOU
A FAIRLY GOOD-SIZED APOLOGY.

136
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:49,115
WHO WAS IT
WAS SAYING THAT STUFF?

137
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,517
UH, WELL, TO BE HONEST
WITH YOU,

138
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:53,152
IT WAS MAINLY HAROLD.

139
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:59,826
[laughing and applause]

140
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:03,663
OH, PLANTS SHRIVEL UP
WHEN YOU WALK IN THE ROOM 

141
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,998
PEOPLE PULL BACK
WHEN YOU'RE NEAR 

142
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,334
ANIMALS REEL,
FALL DOWN AND GO BOOM 

143
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,837
AND THE REASON
IS PERFECTLY CLEAR 

144
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,339
YOU GOT HALITOSIS 

145
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:16,008
IT'S NOT OSMOSIS 

146
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,678
IT AIN'T NO BED OF ROSES 

147
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,514
IT'S HALITOSIS 

148
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,850
EYES WILL WATER,
FRIENDS WILL FALL 

149
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:28,788
HALITOSIS IS WORSE THAN
HAVING NO BREATH AT ALL 

150
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:32,458
WHEN THAT WATER KNOCKED ME
OUT OF THE BOAT, I REALIZED

151
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,961
THAT "LIFE PRESERVER"
IS JUST A NAME,

152
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,930
RATHER THAN A DESCRIPTION
OF WHAT SOMETHING DOES,

153
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:41,501
ESPECIALLY IF YOU LEAVE THESE
IN THE WEATHER FOR 20 YEARS,

154
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,136
OR USE 'EM AS BOAT FENDERS.

155
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:44,637
[glass
breaking]

156
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,507
I'LL SHOW YOU
HOW TO MAKE YOURSELF UNSINKABLE

157
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,142
BECAUSE BOYS WILL BE BOYS

158
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,878
BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE THEM
BUOY-- BUOY--

159
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,513
BOY, THE THINGS THAT...

160
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,215
THAT WAS SO SMART
WHEN I THOUGHT OF IT.

161
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,518
WHAT I GOT HERE IS
A BOWL OF JELLY

162
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,952
AND A PAIL OF WATER.

163
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,088
WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH THESE?

164
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,257
REMEMBER, THIS IS
A FAMILY SHOW.

165
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:07,026
ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA TAKE
THE JELLY, OK?

166
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,662
THOUGHT THERE WAS
A SPOON AROUND HERE.

167
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,164
OH, WELL, NEVER MIND.

168
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,900
OH, BOY,
THAT BRINGS BACK MEMORIES.

169
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:17,170
THAT WAS THE WORST SUMMER JOB
I EVER HAD.

170
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:19,338
I'LL DROP THIS INTO THE WATER.

171
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:20,840
WATCH WHAT HAPPENS.

172
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:24,177
THE JELLY FLOATS,
LIKE THE WAY FAT PEOPLE FLOAT.

173
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,312
MOOSE THOMPSON FLOATS SO HIGH,

174
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,182
HE COULD GET REGISTERED
AS A CRUISE SHIP.

175
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:33,219
THE POINT IS, IF YOU PACK
YOURSELF FULL OF ENOUGH JELLY,

176
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,687
YOU'LL BE A FLOATER.

177
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:37,557
FIRST, GET INTO
ONE OF THESE DRYSUITS.

178
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,993
THESE THINGS KEEP OUT
ALL WATER AND MOISTURE.

179
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,628
THEY ALSO KEEP IT IN,

180
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:46,632
SO DROP IN AT THE JOHN
BEFORE YOU HOP INTO THIS UNIT.

181

[panting]

183
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,746
WASN'T TOO BAD.

184
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,983
ALL RIGHT, ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS

185
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,653
PUT THE MAN-SIZED WETSUIT
OVER TOP.

186
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,155
[gasping]

187
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,224
OH, GOOD.

[glass

190
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,938
ALL RIGHT, FORGET THE WETSUIT.

191
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,807
I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

192
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,542
A RAINSUIT IS WATER-TIGHT.

193
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,345
ALL YOU DO IS SEAL
THE SEAMS WITH DUCT TAPE,

194
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:33,846
THE CUFFS AND SO ON,

195
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:36,415
AND YOU'RE AS GOOD
AS MAKING IT HAPPEN.

196
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,984
NOW COMES THE FUN PART.

197
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,654
YOU WANT TO GET YOURSELF
A WHOLE WHACK OF JELLY POWDER.

198
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:45,825
FIGURE ON ONE CUP OF POWDER FOR
EVERY 10 POUNDS OF BODY WEIGHT.

199
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:49,328
YOU WANT TO PULL THE RAINSUIT
AWAY FROM THE DRYSUIT

200
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,797
AND THEN POUR THE POWDER
IN BETWEEN.

201
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:56,002
TRY TO PICK A FLAVOUR OF JELLY
THAT MATCHES YOUR SKIN COLOUR,

202
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,704
'CAUSE THERE MAY BE
SOME LEAKAGE HERE.

203
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,408
[coughing]

204
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,979
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE PUT THAT
IN THERE

205
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,750
WITH AN INSULATION BLOWER,
BUT WE'RE ON A BUDGET.

206
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,219
ALL'S YOU DO IS ADD THE WATER.

207
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,923
THIS IS PRETTY
SELF-EXPLANATORY,

208
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:20,726
ALTHOUGH IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN
TO PEOPLE PASSING BY.

209
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,999
ALL RIGHT, ALL'S YOU GOTTA DO
IS MIX THE WATER

210
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,668
WITH THE JELLY POWDER.

211
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,970
[water gurgling]

[rubber squeaking]

213
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,683
THERE YOU GO.

214
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,685
YOU'RE SET --
YOU'RE UNSINKABLE.

215
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,387
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

216
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,356
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

217
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,691
THEY'LL FIND ME FISHING.

218

00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,665
DO I LOOK SOBER?

221
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,068
YOU CAN TELL A LOT ABOUT PEOPLE

222
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,270
FROM HOW THEY REACT TO WORMS.

223
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,310
WE'RE SET TO GO FISHING SUNDAY.

224
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:12,812
I GOT
GREAT NEWS--

225
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,313
NO, NO TIME FOR THAT.

226
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,816
STICK YOUR HAND OUT --
THOSE ARE FOR YOU.

227
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,784
YOU SAVE MONEY
WHEN YOU BUY WORMS IN BULK.

228
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:22,188
[screaming]

229
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:24,323
[shrieking]

230

ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

231
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,528
SUIT YOURSELF --
I'LL TAKE 'EM.

232
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:32,465
YOU CAN'T GO FISHING SUNDAY --
YOU'LL BE IN CHURCH.

233
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:37,136
SORRY, HAROLD, BUT COME SUNDAY,
YOU'LL FIND ME OUT ON THE LAKE.

234
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,071
THAT'S PART
OF MY EXCITING NEWS.

235
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,611
WE'RE GONNA MEET,
TIE THE BOATS TOGETHER,

236
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,581
AND HAVE A SERVICE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAKE.

237
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,650
I WOULDN'T MIND SITTING
IN A PEW

238
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:53,786
IF IT HAD A 200-HORSEPOWER
OUTBOARD ON THE BACK.

239
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,288
SO I WILL SEE YOU
IN CHURCH ON SUNDAY.

240
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,957
I WON'T NEED THESE, THEN.

241
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,792
OH, NO!

242
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,427
DON'T GIVE-- AHHH! AHHH!

243
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,062
FOR THOSE OF YOU LOOKING

244
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,931
FOR SOMEBODY
ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF SAFETY,

245
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,300
LOOK NO FURTHER
THAN BUZZ SHERWOOD.

246
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,302
HEY, CHUBBY RED GUY.

247
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:11,804
AND HAROLD!

248
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,739
ALL RIGHT, LET'S TALK SAFETY.

249
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:17,209
LET'S TALK TO THE GUYS
THAT THINK THEY'RE WIMPING OUT

250
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,345
WHEN THEY'RE SAYING
THEY'RE HURT.

251
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:20,746
IT'S OK TO SAY UNCLE.

252
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,314
MY AUNT TAUGHT ME THAT.

253
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,917
IT TAKES A BIG MAN
TO ADMIT HE NEEDS HELP.

254
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,318
TAKE ME, FOR EXAMPLE.

255
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:28,821
WE'RE OUT ON THE WATER,
HORSING AROUND.

256
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,757
I'VE HURT MYSELF --
I NEED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

257
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,759
I'M NOT TOO PROUD TO ADMIT IT.

258
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,761
MY GOSH! WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

259
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:38,531
WE WERE TRYING
THIS NEW THING OUT.

260
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,767
WE CALL IT WHITE-WATER
PARA-AIR-SKIING.

261
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,769
WOW! SOUNDS DANGEROUS, BUZZ.

262
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,005
WE'RE STARTING
TO THINK SO, TOO.

263
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:49,208
YOU STRAP ON A PAIR OF SKIS
BEHIND THE PLANE.

264
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:52,278
TOWS YOU OUT ON THE LAKE
AND UP 5,000 FEET.

265
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,580
YOU PULL THIS RELEASE
AND YOU DROP,

266
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:57,483
BUT NOT BEFORE YOU PULL
YOUR PARA-SAIL OUT,

267
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,219
AND YOU GLIDE AROUND THE LAKE
FOR A WHILE

268
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,688
AND THEN YOU RELEASE THAT
AT 100 FEET

269
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:05,291
AND YOU FALL
INTO MERCURY CREEK RAPIDS.

270
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:08,294
I CAN'T BELIEVE A PERSON
COULD GET HURT DOING THAT.

271
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,762
OH, GO FIGURE, HUH?

272
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:13,232
I THINK IT'S WHEN I BANKED
OFF THE BEAVER DAM.

273
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,101
THAT MIGHT HAVE DONE IT.

274
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,802
STARTING TO BLACK OUT.

275
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,804
I NEED SOME X-RAYS,
SO SAFETY FIRST.

276
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,306
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

277
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:23,309
THAT MIGHT BE PART
OF YOUR PROBLEM.

278
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,744
OH!

279
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,078
OH, YEAH!

280
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,413
YOU ALL RIGHT?

281
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,914
RED, I'M CURED!

282
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,250
HEY, BILL,
I'M GONNA GO AGAIN!

283
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,752
SAFETY FIRST!

284
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,987
YAHOO!

285
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,756
OK, THIS IS THE BIG ONE,

286
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:39,759
FOR THE GRAND CASH PRIZE OF...

287
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,260
... ABOUT 45 CENTS OR SO.

288
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:45,197
UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO MAKE MR. HUMPHREY SAY

289
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,832
THIS WORD.

290
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,169
GO!

291
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,239
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS SOMETHING

292
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:55,307
THAT YOUR DAUGHTER
DOES NOT HAVE.

293
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,409
A CLUE?

294
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,578
SOMETHING SHE DOESN'T HAVE.

295
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:01,080
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

296
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,282
A LIFE?

297
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,617
MONEY
OF HER OWN?

298
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:05,951
AMBITION?

299
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,386
DECENT FRIENDS,
A CAR?

300
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,022
I'M NOT GONNA BUY A CAR
FOR HER!

301
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,857
HOW ABOUT SOME SELF-ESTEEM?

302
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:14,760
HOW ABOUT THE DESIRE
TO GET OFF THAT COUCH?

303
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,295
HOW ABOUT A DECENT HUSBAND

304
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,597
INSTEAD OF THAT NEANDERTHAL
SHE'S DATING?

305
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:19,965
HOW ABOUT ONE CLUE

306
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:23,302
ABOUT WHAT TO DO
WITH THE REST OF HER LIFE?

307
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,738
HOW ABOUT A JOB?

308
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,740
THERE YOU GO! CONGRATULATIONS!

THERE ARE SO MANY USES
FOR THE HAMMER,

314
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,255
YOU HAVE TO LIST THEM
ALPHABETICALLY.

315
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:46,025
"A" FOR ABBA...

316

"C" FOR CAPTAIN AND TENILLE...

TO STICK A CANOE UP

320
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,538
SO WE GOT A STEEPLE THING
POINTING OUT OF THE LAKE.

321
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,040
JUNIOR SINGLETON SAID

322
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:04,777
IF WE POUR GASOLINE OVER ALL
THE THING, YOU GET THE COLOURS

323
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,279
LIKE A STAINED GLASS...
LAKE, REALLY.

324
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,814
WHO'S THE MINISTER

325
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,316
AT THIS WIs1DING,
HAROLD?

326
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:13,052
THE REVEREND GARTH --
VERY, VERY PROGRESSIVE.

327
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:16,155
THE GUY WITH THREE EX-WIVES
AND THE LIVE-IN GIRLFRIEND?

328
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,957
HE'S KEEPING UP WITH THE TIMES.

329
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:22,294
HE INTRODUCED ALL THE NEW TYPES
OF MUSIC INTO THE HYMN SINGS.

330
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,598
YEAH, THERE'S FOLK MUSIC HE DID
AND HEAVY METAL.

331
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:28,734
REMEMBER THE RAP VERSION
OF "AMAZING GRACE"?

332
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,236
[making boombox sounds]

333
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,238
 AMAZING GRACE,
HOW SWEET THOU ART 

334
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:36,041
 THAT S-S-S-SAVED
A WRETCH LIKE ME 

335
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:38,244
 YO, MAMA! 

336
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,713
[applause]

337
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:45,584
[cheering and whistling]

338
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:46,919
YOU LIKE RAP, HAROLD?

339
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,254
OH, YEAH.

340
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,655
STICK YOUR KNUCKLES OUT.

341
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,990
HEY!

342
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,992
OH, HEY, MAN, SAFETY FIRST!

343
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:56,228
I'M BUZZ SHERWOOD,
AND IF YOU FLY YOUR PLANE,

344
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,264
DON'T GO CHASING BIRDS, OK?

345
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,734
YOU MIGHT THINK IT'S FUN,
BUT IT'S DANGEROUS!

346
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,636
BESIDES, IF YOU HIT ONE,

347
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:07,006
THERE'S ONLY ENOUGH
FOR, LIKE, ONE SERVING.

348
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,109
(Red): BACK AT THE MARTIAL ARTS
DEMONSTRATION,

349
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:12,278
BILL'S GONNA TRY
A RUNNING ATTACK

350
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:13,846
ON THE.. THAT'S THE ROPE.

351
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,614
IT'S ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE FINE.

352
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:17,616
THE RUNNING ATTACK
ON THE BOARD.

353
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,786
KIND OF DID THE UP-AND-OVER
THING AND-- OH, BOY!

354
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,289
OH, MY GOSH! HEY! HEY!

355
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:24,723
WELL, HE SPLIT THE BOARD.

356
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,292
HE SPLIT THE BOARD,

357
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:29,395
WHICH WAS REAL CONVENIENT
FOR WHAT WE HAD PLANNED NEXT.

358
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:30,863
REST IN PEACE, BILL.

359
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,498
OF COURSE, HE'S FINE.

360
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:36,235
OK, WE GOT A KARATE THING
GOING ON HERE, HAROLD?

361
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,237
KARATE -- THAT'S... OH...

362
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,239
WHAT? OH, MY GOSH.

363
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,740
OH, MY.

364
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,242
OHHH!

365
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,944
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS, UH...

366
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,413
MY APOLOGIES
TO SUMO WRESTLERS EVERYWHERE.

367
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,747
HOLY MACKEREL.

368
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,116
OH, MAN! IS THAT
A TRACTOR TIRE?

369
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:54,753
WHEN I STARTED DOING
THIS PROGRAMME, I REALLY...

370
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,089
WHAT I HAD IN MIND WAS

371
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,757
AN OUTDOORSY KIND OF...

372
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:01,026
SOMETHING YOU COULD BE PROUD OF

373
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,262
WHEN YOU WANT
TO GIVE PEOPLE...

374
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,763
OH, MAN.

375
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,666
GIVE PEOPLE HINTS AND TIPS
ON HOW TO DO THINGS

376
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,168
AND HOW TO BE SMARTER

377
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:12,671
WITH THEIR FELLOW MAN,
AND THEN SOMETIMES YOU...

378
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,106
YOU SEE THE RESULTS

379
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,809
AND YOU JUST-- OH!

380
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,178
THIS IS NOT WHAT I HAD IN MIND

381
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:21,347
WHEN I WAS... YEAH, FINE.

382
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,549
YOU'RE NOT GONNA SEE THAT

383
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,185
ON THE EDUCATIONAL CHANNEL --
WHAT DO YOU--

384
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,920
OH, OH, OH, OH!

385
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,989
ALL RIGHT, BILL, I GUESS...

386
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:33,225
I GUESS WE'VE SEEN
THE LAST OF BILL, AND...

387
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,728
OK, HAROLD, HAROLD, HAROLD,
YOU WIN.

388
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,229
[ringing

389
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:41,934
SAVED BY THE BELL, THERE, BILL.

390
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,936
IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER.

391
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,638
RANGER GORD GETS
A BUNCH OF MEDALS.

392
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,579
OUR CHURCH SERVICE IS TURNING
INTO A BIG ATTRACTION.

393
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,080
GUESS WHO'S COMING.

394
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:58,484
WHO HAS MADE MORE NORTH
AMERICAN MEN TURN TO RELIGION

395
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,852
THAN ANYBODY ELSE?

396
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,854
LORENA BOBBITT?

397
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,822
[audience laughing]

398
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,591
HAROLD, FOR GOSH SAKES!

399
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:08,093
THE GUY AT THE SPORTING EVENTS!

400
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,031
THE GUY THAT HOLDS UP
THE SIGN, SAYS "JOHN 11:13".

401
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,532
THE SIGN GUY'S COMING?

402
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,168
WILL HE HAVE
A STRIPED WIG AND EVERYTHING?

403
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,804
THIS IS GONNA BE
THE BIGGEST THING

404
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,440
THAT EVER HIT POSSUM LAKE --
WAIT TILL THE FIREWORKS.

405
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,276
NOAH'S ARK, ALL DONE
IN PINWHEELS.

406
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,778
WHOA, WHOA,
UNCLE RED.

407
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:27,780
YOU GUYS ARE
MISSING THE POINT.

408
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:30,149
RELIGION'S NOT ABOUT
PUTTING ON A SHOW.

409
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,385
THAT'S WHY THEY GET
THE LOUSY TURN-OUT, HAROLD.

410
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:36,922
YOU ADD A COUPLE OF MIRACLES
AND A LITTLE PIZZAZZ,

411
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:40,526
YOU CAN TURN A MONEY-LOSING
VENTURE INTO A CASH COW

412
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,295
WITH INTERNATIONAL
FRANCHISE POTENTIAL!

413
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:46,298
IS THIS YOU SPEAKING
IN TONGUES, UNCLE RED?

414
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,800
I GOT RELIGION, HAROLD.

415
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,868
OH, HEAVEN, HELP US.

416

00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,809
AND HAROLD!

419
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,143
GUESS WHAT.

420
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,478
I GOT A BIG PROMOTION.

421
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,813
PROMOTION, GORD?

422
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,147
YES, SIR.

423
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:05,417
AFTER 16 YEARS OF BEING
A FOREST RANGER GRADE 3,

424
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:08,754
I'M NOW BEING PROMOTED
TO FOREST RANGER GRADE 2.

425
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,756
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS
TO YOU, GORD!

426
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,257
THANKS VERY MUCH.

427
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,059
YOU SURE PAID YOUR DUES.

428
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,462
SIXTEEN YEARS UP HERE,
ALL ALONE.

429
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,764
WHERE WILL YOU BE WORKING NOW?

430
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,265
HERE.

431
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:24,269
OH, BUT I GUESS YOU'RE GETTING
A BIG RAISE IN PAY.

432
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,772
I HAVEN'T HAD A PAYCHEQUE
IN OVER 10 YEARS.

433
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,207
ANYWAY, THE THING IS,

434
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,076
I GET TO DECORATE MY UNIFORM
WITH THESE MEDALS.

435
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:34,213
THE FORESTRY DEPARTMENT
MUST HAVE DROPPED THEM OFF.

436
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,281
I FOUND THEM
IN A PILE OVER THERE.

437
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:39,785
UH, THOSE ARE
BEER BOTTLE CAPS, GORD.

438
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,120
[laughing]

439
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,521
RED, EVERYBODY KNOWS

440
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,791
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO DRINK BEER IN THE FOREST.

441
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,293
OH, YEAH, WHAT WAS I THINKING?

442
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,795
I DON'T KNOW.

443
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,296
NOW, THIS ONE SAYS "BUD".

444
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,799
THAT'S FOR
"BUDDY OF THE FOREST".

445
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,334
OH, FOR GOSH SAKES.

446
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,902
THIS ONE SAYS "50".

447
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,804
THAT'S FOR "50 YEARS--"

448
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,806
OH... OH...

449
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,307
"50 MONTHS OF SERVICE".

450
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:03,809
OK, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

451
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,144
I GET FOUR OF THESE.

452
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,478
ALL RIGHT!

453
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:07,813
TWO, THREE, FOUR.

454
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,481
THIS ONE SAYS "LAGER".

455
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,949
YEAH.

456
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:14,486
THAT'S FOR MY WORK PROTECTING
THE FOREST AGAINST LOGGERS.

457
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:15,821
THAT WILL BE IT.

458
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,489
THOUGHT "LOGGER" WAS SPELLED
WITH AN "O".

459
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:18,824
DOESN'T MATTER.

460
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,827
CAN YOU STICK AROUND
FOR THE PRESENTATION CEREMONY?

461
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,329
WE WOULDN'T MISS IT

462
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:26,198
OKEY-DOKEY.

463
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,833

00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,828
[mimicking drum sounds]

481
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:33,899
I THINK I DESERVE A MEDAL
FOR KEEPING A STRAIGHT FACE.

482
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,835
IT'S "MALE CALL"!

483
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,337
OH, HAROLD.

484
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,839
[applause]

485
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,174
OW.

486
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,243
HERE'S OUR LETTER THIS WEEK,

487
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:47,246
FROM LARRY IN MICHIGAN,
AND LARRY WRITES:

488
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:50,849
"DEAR RED, DOES EVERYONE
IN CANADA SPEAK FRENCH?"

489
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,518
WELL, UH, YEAH, A LITTLE,
YOU KNOW,

490
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,488
OR AS THE FRENCH WOULD SAY,
UN "POO".

491
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:59,024
[audience laughing]

492
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,260
WE ALL TRY TO SPEAK
A LITTLE FRENCH.

493
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:03,295
TRY TO KEEP
THE COUNTRY TOGETHER.

494
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,497
SO FAR, IT'S NOT GOING
ALL THAT WELL.

495
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:08,800
[audience laughing]

496
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:11,470
I WONDER WHY.

497
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:16,308
[speaking French badly]:
OUI, CE EST UN GROS DOMMAGE,

498
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:20,312
UN ET UN MYSTERIO
POUR "MOO-AH".

499
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:21,880
N'EST-CE PAS-QUE?

500
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,818
YEAH.

501
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:33,325
[audience laughing]

502
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:37,262
WE HAD A LITTLE REHEARSAL
FOR OUR CHURCH SERVICE.

503
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:40,832
DIDN'T GO JUST EXACTLY
AS PLANNED, YOU KNOW.

504
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:44,336
IT WAS
A JUDGMENT!

505
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,138
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, HAROLD.

506
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,206
A LIGHTNING BOLT
ON A CLEAR DAY?

507
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:49,875
I TAKE THAT AS A WARNING.

508
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,677
IT WASN'T A LIGHTNING BOLT.

509
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:54,279
IT WAS TOO MANY BOATS
TOO CLOSE TOGETHER

510
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:57,849
WITH TOO FEW BILGE PUMPS
AND TOO MANY LEAKY GAS LINES.

511
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:01,353
BUT THE CANDLES --
THAT WAS STUPID.

512
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,854
THAT WAS STUPID.

513
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,790
WE DID HAVE A MIRACLE.

514
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,291
NOBODY WAS KILLED.

515
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:09,795
AND THE EXPLOSION
PARTED POSSUM LAKE...

516
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:12,297
JUST FOR A SECOND.

517
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:15,300
I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE
OF YOUR SNOWMOBILE.

518
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,802
[possum squeal]

519
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,303
MEETING TIME.

520
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,805
YOU GO AHEAD, HAROLD.

521
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:22,307
I'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.

522
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:25,177
IT'S OVER THERE, HAROLD.

523
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:26,745
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

524
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,348
I'VE GAINED A NEW RESPECT
FOR RELIGION.

525
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:31,483
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD JOIN ME.

526
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,952
WE'D GO TO CHURCH
AND RENEW OUR VOWS,

527
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,421
AND GO TO THE MOTEL,
RENEW OUR HONEYMOON,

528
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:39,257
PROVIDING I CAN RENEW
MY MEDICAL INSURANCE.

529
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:41,727
THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

530
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:44,629
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND THE REVEREND HAROLD

531
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,833
AND THE WHOLE GANG,
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

532
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:49,835
[applause]

533
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:51,837
[cheering and whistling]

534
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:53,839
[possum squeal]

535
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:56,408
(Harold): ALL RISE, ALL RISE!

536
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:03,849
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

537
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,984
STINKY PETERSON
WILL BE HAVING

538
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,686
A FAMILY REUNION
AGAIN.

539
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,087
[audience
groaning]

540
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:12,124
HE SAID, "DON'T WORRY,
YOU'LL KNOW WHERE."

541
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:18,163


542
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,065


543
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,800


544
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,301


545
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,303


546
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:28,206


547
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,915
