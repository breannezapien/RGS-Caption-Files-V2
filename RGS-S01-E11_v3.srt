HAPPEN.

WELL, OKAY, AS FAR AS I KNOW,

HELLO.

00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:12,238
AND WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

26
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,874
AND A VERY SPECIAL HELLO TO ALL

27
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:15,808
THE SECURITY GUARDS OUT THERE

28
00:01:15,808 --> 00:01:17,543
WHO'VE CHOSEN TO WATCH US RATHER

29
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:19,746
THAN THE LOBBY MONITOR.

30
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,914
AND YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN UP AT THE

31
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,748
LODGE HERE LAST NIGHT.

32
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,916
WE HAD A LITTLE TALENT SHOW, YOU

33
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,851
KNOW, JUST A BUNCH OF US.

34
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:25,885
STINKY PETERSON WENT FIRST,

35
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:26,586
ACTUALLY.

36
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,553
WHAT HE DID WAS, HE SWALLOWED

37
00:01:27,553 --> 00:01:29,389
AIR FOR ABOUT 12 OR 13 MINUTES.

38
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:30,590
AND THEN HE TURNED AROUND AND

39
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,426
BELCHED MACARTHUR PARK.

40
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,861
IT WAS FABULOUS.

41
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,562
WE WERE KIND OF AFRAID TO ASK

42
00:01:36,562 --> 00:01:38,264
FOR AN ENCORE.

43
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,365
ACTUALLY, HAROLD AND I HERE EVEN

44
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:40,733
DID A LITTLE--OH, I'M SORRY.

45
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,135
I HAVEN'T INTRODUCED HAROLD.

46
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,069
HAROLD, COME ON IN HERE A SEC.

47
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,537
HAROLD IS THE PRODUCER,

48
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:45,405
DIRECTOR, AND ANNOUNCER OF THE

49
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,205
SHOW.

50
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:47,040
PLUS, WE'RE HELPING HIM GET

51
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,241
THROUGH PUBERTY, IN CASE HE

52
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,175
LOSES THE MAP OR ANYTHING, YOU

53
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:50,009

54
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,046
>> AND DON'T FORGET THIS.

55
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,280
[laughs]

56
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,582
I DO ALL THE SPECIAL EFFECTS.

57
00:01:56,582 --> 00:01:57,316
>> YEAH, HAROLD, I WAS JUST

58
00:01:57,316 --> 00:01:58,117
TELLING THEM ABOUT

59
00:01:58,117 --> 00:01:59,285
THE TALENT SHOW.

60
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,353
>> YES, I WAS JUST RELIVING

61
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:01,654
THOSE MOMENTS MYSELF.

62
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:02,422
YOU KNOW, AND IT GAVE ME THE

63
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:03,856
MOTIVATION AND OPPORTUNITY TO

64
00:02:03,856 --> 00:02:05,858
QUEUE UP THE NEXT SEGMENT.

65
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:06,759
SO, UNCLE RED, WHY DON'T WE

66
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:07,894
JUST, LIKE, YOU KNOW, SKIP RIGHT

67
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:08,694
ON OVER TO THAT?

68
00:02:08,694 --> 00:02:09,695
AND THEN WE CAN COME BACK TO YOU

69
00:02:09,695 --> 00:02:11,397
DREDGING UP THE PAST LATER.

70
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:12,231
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, IF THERE'S

71
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:16,736
TIME.

72
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:17,603
>> WELL, HAROLD, I WANTED TO

73
00:02:17,603 --> 00:02:18,704
KIND OF CONTINUE WITH WHAT I WAS

74
00:02:18,704 --> 00:02:19,372
SAYING.

75
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:20,740
>> OH, BOY.

76
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,774
UNCLE RED, I WISH YOU'D TOLD ME

77
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:22,575
THAT.

78
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:23,276
OH, I'M--

79
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,244
OH, JEEPERS, I'M SORRY.

80
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:30,683
>> THERE'S A FUNNY

81
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:31,717
LITTLE DITTY

82
00:02:31,717 --> 00:02:33,352
[whistles]

83
00:02:33,352 --> 00:02:35,421
IT'S CALLED THE HUMMING SONG

84
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:37,023
[whistles]

85
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,891
THE HUMMING SONG IS PRETTY

86
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:40,860
[whistles]

87
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,895
BUT I DON'T KNOW IT.

88
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,106
THIS WEEK ON HANDYMAN CORNER,

89
00:02:54,106 --> 00:02:56,776
I'M GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT VCRs,

90
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,445
WHICH STANDS FOR, UH--

91
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:00,980
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

92
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,281
BEFORE I PURCHASED THIS UNIT, I

93
00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:04,183
READ ALL THE MAGAZINES ABOUT IT.

94
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,484
AND I SPOKE TO THE PRODUCTION

95
00:03:05,484 --> 00:03:06,152
PERSONNEL HERE

96
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:07,386
AT THE RED GREEN SHOW.

97
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:08,921
AND THEY ADVISED ME TO

98
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:11,090
GET ONE OF THESE BETA UNITS.

99
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,925
AND EVEN THE SALESMAN AT THE

100
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:14,226
STORE SAID, "BOY, THEY DON'T

101
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:16,395
MAKE THEM LIKE THIS ANYMORE."

102
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:17,430
SO I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT

103
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,664
WHENEVER I GET A NEW CAR OR A

104
00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:20,232
LAWNMOWER, WHAT HAVE YOU, I LIKE

105
00:03:20,232 --> 00:03:21,701
TO JUST TAKE IT APART, CHECK IT

106
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,635
OUT MYSELF, KIND OF TUNE IT UP

107
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:23,536
FOR MY OWN PARTICULAR

108
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,270
REQUIREMENTS.

109
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,304
AND I'M GONNA DO THE SAME WITH

110
00:03:25,304 --> 00:03:26,572
MY BETA UNIT HERE,

111
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:27,974
ESPECIALLY SINCE MY RAMBO TAPE

112
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:28,774
IS JAMMED IN THERE.

113
00:03:28,774 --> 00:03:29,508
I CAN'T SEEM TO GET IT OUT.

114
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:31,210
SO I'VE JUST GOT ONE MORE SCREW

115
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:36,415
TO POP OFF HERE.

116
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:37,783
OKAY.

117
00:03:37,783 --> 00:03:39,885
KIND OF SET FOR SCREWING IN

118
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:40,920
WHICH DOESN'T HELP.

119
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,622
ANYWAY, THIS SHOULD POP OFF OF

120
00:03:43,622 --> 00:03:45,925
HERE NOW.

121
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:46,759
ALL RIGHT.

122
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,427
OKAY.

123
00:03:48,427 --> 00:03:50,763
LET'S SEE WHAT WE GOT HERE.

124
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,598
YEAH, OH, YEAH.

125
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:55,334
WELL, I THINK THAT THERE

126
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:57,470
IS A WIRE.

127
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,105
AND THIS SEEMS TO BE SOME TYPE

128
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,540
OF A PLASTIC.

129
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,742
AND I GUESS TO GET THE ACTUAL

130
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,509
CASSETTE OUT,

131
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:07,046
I'M GONNA NEED TO--

132
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:09,482
[muttering]

133
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,524
ALL RIGHT,

134
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:19,425
THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME SORT OF

135
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,493
A MALFUNCTION HERE.

136
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:21,460
AND I THINK THE ONLY WAY TO GET

137
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,294
THE CASSETTE OUT

138
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:23,395
IS TO CUT IT OUT.

139
00:04:23,395 --> 00:04:25,931
AND I THINK I HAVE THE PERFECT

140
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:28,701
TOOL FOR THAT.

141
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:32,238
[whirring]

142
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:35,508
SO NOW WHAT WE HAVE IS A MOVIE

143
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,910
WITH AN INTERMISSION.

144
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,144
BUT SINCE I'VE GOT THE MACHINE

145
00:04:39,144 --> 00:04:41,480
APART ANYWAY, MIGHT AS WELL TAKE

146
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,415
ONE LAST LOOK AT IT, MAKE SURE

147
00:04:43,415 --> 00:04:46,819
THAT EVERYTHING'S--YEAH, YEAH.

148
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:50,089
EVERYTHING LOOKS OKAY.

149
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:53,058
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT DOES SO

150
00:04:53,058 --> 00:04:53,926
MIGHT AS WELL TAKE THOSE

151
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:54,760
OUT OF THERE.

152
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,229
KEEP IT SIMPLE IS MY MOTTO.

153
00:04:57,229 --> 00:04:58,264
AND I'LL JUST GIVE HER JUST A

154
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:04,270
LITTLE CLEAN OUT HERE.

155
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,841
[hissing]

156
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:11,443
ALL RIGHT.

157
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:13,712
THAT SHOULD DO IT.

158
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:15,714
IT'S NO BIG DEAL, REALLY.

159
00:05:15,714 --> 00:05:16,949
NO MATTER WHAT THEY MAKE, MAKE

160
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:19,518
IT A MICROWAVE OVEN OR A HAIR

161
00:05:19,518 --> 00:05:21,387
DRYER OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, IF

162
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,055
MEN MAKE IT, MEN CAN FIX IT.

163
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:25,424
SO UNTIL NEXT TIME, REMEMBER, IF

164
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:26,825
WOMEN DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

165
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:27,660
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST

166
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,628
FIND YOU HANDY.

167
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,069
OH, WAIT.

168
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:37,903
THERE'S AN EJECT BUTTON.

169
00:05:37,903 --> 00:05:41,240
I DIDN'T SEE THAT.

170
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,408
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK

171
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:43,342
AFTER THESE MESSAGES.

172
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,410
AND I'LL FINISH MY STORY.

173
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,577
COUNT ON IT.

174
00:05:45,577 --> 00:05:46,678
>> UNLESS I GET ANOTHER ATTACK

175
00:05:46,678 --> 00:05:48,247
OF ENNUI.

176
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:49,081
>> I DON'T THINK YOU WILL,

177
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:50,749
NOT ON PAYDAY.

178
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:52,718
>> GOOD POINT.

179
00:06:00,826 --> 00:06:02,060
>> YOU KNOW, HAROLD,

180
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,328
I WAS READING THERE THEY GOT

181
00:06:03,328 --> 00:06:05,230
THESE ATOMIC BOMBS NOW.

182
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:05,898
WELL, THEY'VE HAD THEM

183
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:06,565
FOR A WHILE, I GUESS.

184
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:07,866
>> YOU'VE MENTIONED THAT, YEAH.

185
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:08,867
>> THEY WON'T SELL ME ONE,

186
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:10,202
THOUGH.

187
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:11,069
>> YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT NO PLACE

188
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:11,737
TO KEEP IT.

189
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:12,571
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE AN ATOMIC

190
00:06:12,571 --> 00:06:13,238
WAREHOUSE.

191
00:06:13,238 --> 00:06:14,373
>> I WOULDN'T HAVE IT LONG.

192
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:15,440
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT LIKE I'D NEED

193
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,375
TO STORE IT OVER A WINTER

194
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,709
OR ANYTHING.

195
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:19,044
BUT IT'S JUST TRYING TO FIGURE

196
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:19,711
OUT, YOU KNOW,

197
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:20,879
EXACTLY HOW THE BOMB WORKS.

198
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:22,381
NOW, AN ATOM, APPARENTLY,

199
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,048
IS QUITE SMALL.

200
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:23,749
>> YES.

201
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:25,050
>> AND WHEN YOU BREAK IT UP,

202
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,485
IT GOES UP BIG.

203
00:06:26,485 --> 00:06:27,152
IS THAT IT?

204
00:06:27,152 --> 00:06:27,819
>> EXACTLY.

205
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:29,721
IT EXPLODES BECAUSE IT GETS AWAY

206
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:30,789
FROM ITSELF REALLY QUICK.

207
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:31,456
>> OH, YEAH.

208
00:06:31,456 --> 00:06:32,224
>> IT'S SORT OF LIKE...

209
00:06:32,224 --> 00:06:33,525
>> both: A FAMILY REUNION.

210
00:06:33,525 --> 00:06:34,226
>> EXACTLY.

211
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:35,260
EVERYONE JUST GOES, "THANK YOU.

212
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:35,928
BYE-BYE."

213
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:36,728
AND THEY LEAVE REALLY QUICK.

214
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:37,396
AND THERE'S A BIG

215
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:38,096
INTERNAL COMBUSTION.

216
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:38,964
>> OKAY, NOW, BUT THERE'S A--

217
00:06:38,964 --> 00:06:39,665
NOW, THERE'S NEUTRON

218
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,567
AND A PROTON AND A ELECTRON.

219
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,601
THE ELECTRON, I BELIEVE, IS

220
00:06:42,601 --> 00:06:45,437
IONIZING AROUND THE NUCLEUS.

221
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:47,573
AND IS THAT IT?

222
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,409
>> EXACTLY.

223
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,410
>> THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

224
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,111
AND THEN I THINK THE ELECTRON

225
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:56,081
COMES INTO THE NEUTRON ON, SAY,

226
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:57,582
LIKE, A FRIDAY NIGHT.

227
00:06:57,582 --> 00:06:58,383
>> YEAH.

228
00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:00,085
>> AND THERE'S A COLLISION

229
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:01,086
THERE.

230
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:02,354
AND THE PROTON--

231
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:03,956
>> SAYS HE DIDN'T SEE A THING.

232
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,190
>> NO, EXACTLY.

233
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,359
AND NOW THE NEUTRON IS EXCITED.

234
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:08,260
>> YEAH.

235
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,361
>> AND OF COURSE,

236
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:11,863
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS CENSORED.

237
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:14,833
>> [laughing]

238
00:07:21,373 --> 00:07:22,541
>> "IT IS WINTER.

239
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,242
A CAR DRIVES PAST,

240
00:07:24,242 --> 00:07:25,644
RUSHING TO SOMEWHERE.

241
00:07:25,644 --> 00:07:27,479
THE PEOPLE INSIDE DO NOT FEEL

242
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,181
THE GLOW OF THE WINTER SUN.

243
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:30,716
THEY DO NOT FEEL THE SNOW ON

244
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:32,451
THEIR TONGUE OR THE GENTLE

245
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,619
BREEZE ON THEIR CHEEKS OR THE

246
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:36,421
HUGE WAVE OF SLUSH THAT COVERS

247
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:37,889
ME FROM HEAD TO FOOT

248
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:40,058
AS THEIR CAR DRIVES PAST,

249
00:07:40,058 --> 00:07:41,193
ON ITS WAY TO AN ACCIDENT

250
00:07:41,193 --> 00:07:45,897
IF THERE'S ANY JUSTICE."

251
00:07:45,897 --> 00:07:47,265
WELL, AS I WAS SAYING,

252
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:48,900
WE WERE HAVING A REAL HOOT WITH

253
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,502
THE TALENT SHOW THING.

254
00:07:50,502 --> 00:07:52,404
YOU KNOW, MOOSE THOMPSON DID HIS

255
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:53,905
VERSION OF DIRTY DANCING

256
00:07:53,905 --> 00:07:55,207
WITH A COUPLE OF TRUCK TIRES

257
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:57,242
AND A GREASE GUN.

258
00:07:57,242 --> 00:07:58,743
AND THEN OLD MAN SEDGEWICK

259
00:07:58,743 --> 00:08:00,278
PLAYED HIS MUSICAL SAW.

260
00:08:00,278 --> 00:08:01,446
BUT HE GOT A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY

261
00:08:01,446 --> 00:08:02,314
DURING THE FLIGHT

262
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:03,115
OF THE BUMBLEBEE

263
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,516
AND ENDED UP CUTTING THE CROTCH

264
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:06,518
OUT OF HIS HIP WADERS.

265
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:07,686
HE WASN'T HURT, THOUGH.

266
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:09,588
CLOSE BUT NO CIGAR.

267
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:10,522
>> IS THAT IT, UNCLE RED?

268
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:11,189
IS THAT THE END

269
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:12,190
OF THE TALENT SHOW STORY?

270
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,124
'CAUSE IF IT IS, WE CAN JUST GO

271
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:13,959
ON TO THE NEXT SEGMENT.

272
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,460
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IF THAT'S IT.

273
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,294
>> NO, THAT'S NOT IT, HAROLD.

274
00:08:16,294 --> 00:08:16,962
I'LL TELL YOU

275
00:08:16,962 --> 00:08:17,729
WHEN IT'S FINISHED.

276
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:19,097
>> UH-OH.

277
00:08:19,097 --> 00:08:20,232
JEEPERS, I WISH YOU'D TOLD ME

278
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:21,032
THAT BEFORE I PUSHED THIS

279
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:22,133
BUTTON.

280
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:23,668
>> WHICH BUTTON?

281
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:26,771
>> JUST A SEC.

282
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:28,540
THAT ONE.

283
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,474
>> YOU DID THAT ON PURPOSE,

284
00:08:29,474 --> 00:08:30,375
HAROLD.

285
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,476
>> SORRY, I HAD AN ATTACK OF

286
00:08:31,476 --> 00:08:35,881
ENNUI.

287
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:37,382
>> HI, RED.

288
00:08:37,382 --> 00:08:38,049
I THOUGHT IT WAS YOU.

289
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:38,717
>> YEAH?

290
00:08:38,717 --> 00:08:39,484
>> I RECOGNIZED THE SOUND OF

291
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:40,685
YOUR TRUCK COMING UP THE LANE.

292
00:08:40,685 --> 00:08:41,353
>> OH, YEAH.

293
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:42,153
>> I WAS JUST MAKING SOME TEA.

294
00:08:42,153 --> 00:08:42,821
YOU WANT SOME?

295
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:44,889
ORANGE PEKOE, RABBIT'S FOOT,

296
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:47,559
TREE BARK, OR MOOSE PATTY.

297
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,426
>> WELL, I THINK I'LL STICK WITH

298
00:08:48,426 --> 00:08:49,327
THE ORANGE PEKOE.

299
00:08:49,327 --> 00:08:49,995
>> OKAY, GREAT.

300
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:50,795
>> CAN I GIVE YOU A HAND THERE?

301
00:08:50,795 --> 00:08:51,463
I'LL HOLD THIS FOR YOU.

302
00:08:51,463 --> 00:08:52,130
>> THIS IS GREAT.

303
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:52,831
I'M MAKING TEA.

304
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:54,499
MAKING TEA FOR ME AND RED GREEN.

305
00:08:54,499 --> 00:08:55,667
>> YEAH.

306
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:56,701
>> I HAVEN'T MADE TEA

307
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:57,502
IN 38 DAYS.

308
00:08:57,502 --> 00:08:59,237
>> FOR GOSH SAKE.

309
00:08:59,237 --> 00:09:01,206
WELL, YOU KNOW, I JUST WANTED TO

310
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:02,474
HAVE YOU TELL US ABOUT FIRE

311
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:03,742
SAFETY, 'CAUSE YOU'RE KIND OF

312
00:09:03,742 --> 00:09:04,609
THE EXPERT IN THAT AREA.

313
00:09:04,609 --> 00:09:05,610
>> WELL, I SHOULD BE.

314
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,811
I'VE BEEN UP HERE FOR 13 YEARS.

315
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:07,846
>> OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

316
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:10,682
>> 13 LONG, LONELY YEARS.

317
00:09:10,682 --> 00:09:13,685
[wailing]

318
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:18,023
>> NO, NO, NO, NO.

319
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:20,492
>> YOU KNOW, IT WOULDN'T BE SO

320
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:21,893
BAD IF THERE WAS A FIRE NOW AND

321
00:09:21,893 --> 00:09:23,661
THEN, YOU KNOW, ANYTHING, A

322
00:09:23,661 --> 00:09:26,798
SMALL FIRE, A CONTROLLED BURN,

323
00:09:26,798 --> 00:09:29,367
AN ARTIFICIAL FIREPLACE LOG.

324
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:30,869
I DON'T CARE, ANYTHING.

325
00:09:30,869 --> 00:09:32,103
>> WELL, YOU CAN'T MEAN THAT,

326
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:33,471
GORD.

327
00:09:33,471 --> 00:09:34,372
>> NO, I GUESS NOT.

328
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:36,641
>> NO, YOU KIDDER, HUH?

329
00:09:36,641 --> 00:09:37,308
>> YEAH.

330
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:37,976
>> [laughs]

331
00:09:37,976 --> 00:09:39,244
>> NOT WHEN IT'S BEEN AS DRY

332
00:09:39,244 --> 00:09:40,278
AS IT HAS BEEN, YOU KNOW.

333
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:41,212
IT HASN'T BEEN THIS DRY IN THE

334
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:42,013
WHOLE TIME I'VE BEEN UP HERE.

335
00:09:42,013 --> 00:09:42,680
>> REALLY?

336
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,381
>> YEAH.

337
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:44,182
>> YEAH, IT'S VERY, VERY DRY.

338
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:44,849
>> YEAH.

339
00:09:44,849 --> 00:09:45,817
>> DO YOU GET A LOT OF LIGHTNING

340
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:46,885
UP HERE?

341
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:47,819
I WAS WONDERING ABOUT THAT.

342
00:09:47,819 --> 00:09:49,087
>> WELL, YEAH.

343
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:50,188
BUT IT ONLY HITS MY TOWER.

344
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:51,156
>> OH.

345
00:09:51,156 --> 00:09:52,023
>> YEAH, I'VE GOT THE ONLY METAL

346
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:53,224
FOR 50 SQUARE MILES AROUND.

347
00:09:53,224 --> 00:09:54,325
SO ANY LIGHTNING THAT COMES DOWN

348
00:09:54,325 --> 00:09:55,393
WILL GO THROUGH ME.

349
00:09:55,393 --> 00:09:56,060
>> RIGHT HERE?

350
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:56,728
>> YEAH.

351
00:09:56,728 --> 00:09:57,395
>> BOY.

352
00:09:57,395 --> 00:09:58,196
>> I CAN'T TELL YOU THE NUMBER

353
00:09:58,196 --> 00:09:59,464
OF TIMES I'VE HAD MY EYEBROWS

354
00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:01,566
BLOWN OFF.

355
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:02,433
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T REMEMBER

356
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:04,235
ANYTHING BEFORE THE AGE OF 14.

357
00:10:04,235 --> 00:10:05,503
IT'S THE LIGHTNING THAT DID IT,

358
00:10:05,503 --> 00:10:06,271
I THINK.

359
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:06,938
>> YEAH?

360
00:10:06,938 --> 00:10:07,906
YEAH.

361
00:10:07,906 --> 00:10:09,374
WELL, COULD YOU GIVE OUR VIEWERS

362
00:10:09,374 --> 00:10:10,608
AS KIND OF A SAFETY THING--LIKE,

363
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:12,076
SAY, IT'S IN A LIGHTNING STORM.

364
00:10:12,076 --> 00:10:12,744
IS THERE ANY KIND

365
00:10:12,744 --> 00:10:13,411
OF SAFETY THING?

366
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:14,078
>> SURE.

367
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:14,746
>> WHERE SHOULD THEY GO

368
00:10:14,746 --> 00:10:15,480
IN A LIGHTNING STORM, SAY,

369
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,147
FOR EXAMPLE?

370
00:10:16,147 --> 00:10:16,814
>> WELL, ANYWHERE

371
00:10:16,814 --> 00:10:17,582
BUT THIS TOWER.

372
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:18,283
>> OH, YEAH.

373
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:19,851
>> AND ANOTHER GOOD SAFETY TIP

374
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:21,019
IS, WHEN YOU'RE LIGHTING A

375
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:22,420
CAMPFIRE, MAKE SURE YOU UNPLUG

376
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,888
THE ELECTRIC CHARCOAL STARTER.

377
00:10:23,888 --> 00:10:25,156
>> YEAH, YEAH.

378
00:10:25,156 --> 00:10:25,823
THAT'S VERY GOOD.

379
00:10:25,823 --> 00:10:27,859
OKAY, WELL, WE GOT TO GET GOING,

380
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:28,526
GORD.

381
00:10:28,526 --> 00:10:29,227
SO WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME

382
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:29,894
AROUND, EH?

383
00:10:29,894 --> 00:10:30,795
>> OH, YOU'RE NOT GOING ALREADY,

384
00:10:30,795 --> 00:10:31,462
ARE YOU?

385
00:10:31,462 --> 00:10:32,497
COME ON.

386
00:10:32,497 --> 00:10:33,164
>> I REALLY HAVE TO--

387
00:10:33,164 --> 00:10:33,932
>> YOU HAVEN'T HAD

388
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:34,599
YOUR ORANGE PEKOE.

389
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:35,400
I HAVEN'T HAD MY MOOSE PATTY.

390
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,734
>> NO, WELL, MAYBE SOME OTHER

391
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:37,635
TIME, EH?

392
00:10:37,635 --> 00:10:40,438
>> YOU CAN'T GO YET.

393
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:42,006
BUT WHERE'S THE FIRE?

394
00:10:42,006 --> 00:10:42,840
AS WE SAY.

395
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,946
[laughs]

396
00:10:47,946 --> 00:10:49,914
>> WHAT DO YOU SEE

397
00:10:49,914 --> 00:10:52,517
WHEN YOU LOOK AT A TREE?

398
00:10:52,517 --> 00:10:55,053
ARE YOU SCARED OF THE BARK

399
00:10:55,053 --> 00:10:57,955
OR THE WAY IT'S ALL DARK?

400
00:10:57,955 --> 00:11:00,291
WHAT DO YOU SEE

401
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,061
WHEN YOU LOOK AT A TREE?

402
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:05,563
IF YOU SEE ME

403
00:11:05,563 --> 00:11:08,900
STANDING UP TO A TREE

404
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,735
DON'T MAKE A SOUND

405
00:11:10,735 --> 00:11:13,705
TILL I'M DONE

406
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:17,675
>> UNCLE RED, THIS IS MY

407
00:11:17,675 --> 00:11:18,910
FAVORITE PART OF THE SHOW, WHERE

408
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,411
YOU ANSWER THE VIEWERS' MAIL,

409
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:21,312
'CAUSE I GET TO BRUSH UP ON MY

410
00:11:21,312 --> 00:11:22,480
READING SKILLS, AND IT'S AN

411
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,182
INEXPENSIVE PRODUCTION FILLER.

412
00:11:24,182 --> 00:11:25,283
[laughs]

413
00:11:25,283 --> 00:11:26,451
LETTER NUMBER ONE.

414
00:11:26,451 --> 00:11:28,519
"DEAR RED, WE'RE GOING MOOSE

415
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,387
HUNTING SOON.

416
00:11:29,387 --> 00:11:30,655
AND I WONDERED HOW DO YOU TREAT

417
00:11:30,655 --> 00:11:31,889
A GUNSHOT WOUND IN AN EMERGENCY

418
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:33,758
SITUATION?"

419
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:35,093
>> OH, THAT'S INTERESTING.

420
00:11:35,093 --> 00:11:36,828
I WOULD'VE THOUGHT ANY GUNSHOT

421
00:11:36,828 --> 00:11:39,597
WOUND IS AN EMERGENCY SITUATION.

422
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:41,032
UNLESS MAYBE YOU'RE SHOT

423
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:42,900
BY A DOCTOR IN A HOSPITAL.

424
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,169
>> WHY WOULD A DOCTOR

425
00:11:45,169 --> 00:11:46,637
SHOOT A PATIENT?

426
00:11:46,637 --> 00:11:47,939
>> I DON'T KNOW.

427
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:48,639
MAYBE SOME KIND OF

428
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,108
A MAKE-WORK PROJECT.

429
00:11:51,108 --> 00:11:52,743
>> WELL, LET'S ASSUME THAT THE

430
00:11:52,743 --> 00:11:53,644
GUNSHOT WOUND HAPPENED IN AN

431
00:11:53,644 --> 00:11:54,745
OPEN FIELD, IF I MIGHT

432
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:56,047
INTERPULATE TO THAT OF WHICH THE

433
00:11:56,047 --> 00:11:57,715
VIEWER HAS ALLUDED.

434
00:11:57,715 --> 00:11:59,617
>> ALL RIGHT.

435
00:11:59,617 --> 00:12:01,219
WELL, FIRST OFF,

436
00:12:01,219 --> 00:12:01,886
YOU HAVE TO DETERMINE

437
00:12:01,886 --> 00:12:04,088
WHERE THE GUNSHOT WOUND IS.

438
00:12:04,088 --> 00:12:05,323
IF IT'S IN THE DUCK OR THE DEER

439
00:12:05,323 --> 00:12:06,657
OR THE MOOSE, WELL, YOU DON'T

440
00:12:06,657 --> 00:12:07,792
TREAT IT AT ALL, 'CAUSE THAT'S

441
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:09,994
WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

442
00:12:09,994 --> 00:12:11,329
BUT IF IT'S IN ONE OF YOUR

443
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:13,097
HUNTING COMPANIONS, THEN THE

444
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:14,265
FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO DO IS

445
00:12:14,265 --> 00:12:15,233
STANCH THE FLOW.

446
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:16,434
>> OH, "STANCH THE FLOW,"

447
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:17,235
THAT SOUNDS NEAT.

448
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:18,336
WHAT IS THAT?

449
00:12:18,336 --> 00:12:19,904
>> STOP THE BLEEDING.

450
00:12:19,904 --> 00:12:21,072
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO DETERMINE

451
00:12:21,072 --> 00:12:22,506
HOW BAD THE WOUND IS.

452
00:12:22,506 --> 00:12:23,474
>> SO, LIKE, YOU MIGHT SAY,

453
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:24,675
LIKE, "HOW DO YOU FEEL?"

454
00:12:24,675 --> 00:12:25,343
OR SOMETHING?

455
00:12:25,343 --> 00:12:26,277
>> YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

456
00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:29,247
AND IF HE SCREAMS, "I'M DYING,"

457
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:31,082
THIS IS NOT GOOD.

458
00:12:31,082 --> 00:12:32,583
IF HE MUMBLES, "I'M DYING,"

459
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,619
THAT'S ACTUALLY WORSE.

460
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:36,120
SO THE NEXT THING YOU TRY TO DO

461
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,622
IS MOVE THE PATIENT

462
00:12:37,622 --> 00:12:38,789
IF HE CAN BE MOVED.

463
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:40,458
BUT IF YOU MOVE HIM AND THE LEG

464
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,893
DOESN'T MOVE WITH THE BODY,

465
00:12:42,893 --> 00:12:44,028
THEN YOU REALLY HAVE TO RETHINK

466
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:46,097
THE TRANSPORTATION METHOD.

467
00:12:46,097 --> 00:12:46,964
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.

468
00:12:46,964 --> 00:12:48,899
SO THE PERSON AND THE LEG SHOULD

469
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:49,600
MOVE TOGETHER.

470
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,267
THAT WOULD BE GOOD.

471
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:51,068
I MEAN, THAT WOULD BE BETTER,

472
00:12:51,068 --> 00:12:51,736
RIGHT?

473
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:52,536
>> YEAH, THAT'S MUCH BETTER.

474
00:12:52,536 --> 00:12:54,305
AND THEN WHAT YOU DO IS, YOU GET

475
00:12:54,305 --> 00:12:55,940
THE GUY TO THE HOSPITAL.

476
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,541
AND THEN YOU GO RIGHT BACK TO

477
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,276
HUNTING, BECAUSE OTHERWISE,

478
00:12:59,276 --> 00:13:00,778
YOU'LL LOSE YOUR NERVE.

479
00:13:00,778 --> 00:13:01,746
>> OH, LOSE YOUR NERVE FOR

480
00:13:01,746 --> 00:13:03,047
HUNTING ALTOGETHER, YOU MEAN?

481
00:13:03,047 --> 00:13:03,748
>> GIVE IT UP.

482
00:13:03,748 --> 00:13:04,448
>> YEAH.

483
00:13:04,448 --> 00:13:05,216
>> YEAH, I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN

484
00:13:05,216 --> 00:13:05,883
TO GUYS.

485
00:13:05,883 --> 00:13:06,884
>> THAT WOULD BE TRAGIC.

486
00:13:06,884 --> 00:13:08,285
>> WELL, IT'S THE DOWNSIDE OF

487
00:13:08,285 --> 00:13:12,990
GETTING SHOT.

488
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,658
THIS WEEK ON ADVENTURES WITH

489
00:13:14,658 --> 00:13:16,060
BILL, HE'S GONNA SHOW YOU

490
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,997
HOW TO ERECT--

491
00:13:19,997 --> 00:13:21,732
THAT'S A TENT, I GUESS IT IS.

492
00:13:21,732 --> 00:13:23,300
YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN BILL REACHES

493
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,903
INTO HIS PANTS.

494
00:13:25,903 --> 00:13:28,405
NOW THIS, TO ME, IS NOT A

495
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:29,473
TECHNIQUE THAT I THINK HE

496
00:13:29,473 --> 00:13:30,908
THOUGHT THROUGH TOTALLY,

497
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:31,675
'CAUSE THOSE PEGS

498
00:13:31,675 --> 00:13:34,245
AND EVERYTHING WENT--

499
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:35,412
THEY WENT ALL OVER THE PLACE.

500
00:13:35,412 --> 00:13:36,847
AND WE WERE THERE FOR A GOOD

501
00:13:36,847 --> 00:13:39,750
TWO, THREE DAYS JUST FINDING THE

502
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,652
LITTLE ATTACHMENTS THAT GO ON

503
00:13:41,652 --> 00:13:43,120
THE END OF THE WHIRLIGIGS THERE.

504
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,955
ANYWAY, I'M HOLDING THE PEG, AND

505
00:13:44,955 --> 00:13:45,990
HE'S GONNA HAMMER IT IN.

506
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,158
AND I THINK THAT HAMMER

507
00:13:47,158 --> 00:13:50,427
LOOKS--YEAH.

508
00:13:50,427 --> 00:13:51,829
I THINK BILL UNDERESTIMATED THE

509
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:52,863
SOFTNESS OF THE GROUND

510
00:13:52,863 --> 00:13:54,532
AT THIS TIME OF YEAR.

511
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:56,166
AND HE DRILLED THAT BABY DOWN A

512
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,635
FOOT AND A HALF, TWO FEET.

513
00:13:57,635 --> 00:14:00,204
BUT, YOU KNOW, BILL SOLVES HIS

514
00:14:00,204 --> 00:14:00,938
OWN PROBLEMS.

515
00:14:00,938 --> 00:14:02,940
THAT'S ABOUT--

516
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,975
AND SOLVES THEM IN HIS OWN WAY.

517
00:14:04,975 --> 00:14:08,045
BUT NOW--WHAT THE DEAL?

518
00:14:08,045 --> 00:14:08,712
HE WANTED ME

519
00:14:08,712 --> 00:14:09,647
TO PUT THIS TENT UP.

520
00:14:09,647 --> 00:14:11,048
BUT IT WOULDN'T REACH.

521
00:14:11,048 --> 00:14:11,749
I WAS JUST GONNA

522
00:14:11,749 --> 00:14:12,583
STRETCH IT UP THERE.

523
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,852
BUT BILL HAD ANOTHER PLAN.

524
00:14:14,852 --> 00:14:16,453
AND HE'S RESOURCEFUL.

525
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:20,724
YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE HIM THAT.

526
00:14:20,724 --> 00:14:21,725
YOU KNOW, BILL'S A LOT STRONGER

527
00:14:21,725 --> 00:14:24,561
THAN HE SMELLS.

528
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:26,664
I DON'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY

529
00:14:26,664 --> 00:14:27,431
THAT ACCOMPLISHED.

530
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:29,133
BUT IT SEEMED TO MAKE BILL

531
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:30,934
HAPPY.

532
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:32,102
AND THEN THE TWO OF US KIND OF

533
00:14:32,102 --> 00:14:33,203
GOT INTO--AND THIS IS NOT ALWAYS

534
00:14:33,203 --> 00:14:34,471
GOOD, TO BE WORKING AT OPPOSITE

535
00:14:34,471 --> 00:14:37,908
ENDS OF A TENT.

536
00:14:37,908 --> 00:14:39,376
YOU NEED KIND OF A COMMUNICATION

537
00:14:39,376 --> 00:14:41,078
THING HAPPENING.

538
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:41,745
AND IT'S FINE.

539
00:14:41,745 --> 00:14:44,415
HE'S FINE.

540
00:14:44,415 --> 00:14:45,516
BILL, HERE--

541
00:14:45,516 --> 00:14:47,518
I GOT A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS.

542
00:14:47,518 --> 00:14:49,019
THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A NORMAL

543
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:50,087
KIND OF A TENT LOOK.

544
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:51,989
AND I WAS TRYING TO DO MY BEST

545
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:52,656
TO HELP.

546
00:14:52,656 --> 00:14:53,757
YOU KNOW, I'M THERE AS A

547
00:14:53,757 --> 00:14:54,591
SUPPORTER, REALLY.

548
00:14:54,591 --> 00:14:56,427
AND LITERALLY, ACTUALLY,

549
00:14:56,427 --> 00:14:59,463
IN THIS CASE.

550
00:14:59,463 --> 00:15:00,130
THAT CAN HAPPEN.

551
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,165
THAT CAN HAPPEN.

552
00:15:01,165 --> 00:15:03,734
AND HE'S WRESTLING AROUND

553
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:04,401
IN THERE.

554
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:05,502
AND OF COURSE, WHAT ARE YOU

555
00:15:05,502 --> 00:15:08,038
SUPPOSE HE COMES OUT WITH?

556
00:15:08,038 --> 00:15:12,376
THE INSTRUCTIONS.

557
00:15:12,376 --> 00:15:14,912
AND I'M UNDER THE TENT THERE,

558
00:15:14,912 --> 00:15:15,579
BILL.

559
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:17,214
I'M UNDER THE--OH, GREAT, GREAT.

560
00:15:17,214 --> 00:15:19,216
THAT'LL WORK WELL.

561
00:15:19,216 --> 00:15:21,318
BILL CAN GET SCARY ON YOU.

562
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:22,886
YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO--

563
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:24,555
OH, HE'S A HAPPY GUY, ISN'T HE?

564
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:26,657
SO NOW WE--SINCE THE POLE GOT A

565
00:15:26,657 --> 00:15:27,825
LITTLE BENT, HE DECIDES HE'S

566
00:15:27,825 --> 00:15:28,959
GONNA TIE HER TO A TREE AND KIND

567
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,228
OF PROP HER UP THAT WAY AND--

568
00:15:31,228 --> 00:15:33,931
OH, OH, OH, OH, OH.

569
00:15:33,931 --> 00:15:35,966
WELL, I DO APPRECIATE THAT,

570
00:15:35,966 --> 00:15:36,767
BILL.

571
00:15:36,767 --> 00:15:37,701
THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH.

572
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:38,635
THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING ME

573
00:15:38,635 --> 00:15:41,905
IN YOUR LIFE.

574
00:15:41,905 --> 00:15:44,141
THIS IS AN OLD INDIAN TECHNIQUE

575
00:15:44,141 --> 00:15:45,676
THAT BILL FINALLY RESORTED TO

576
00:15:45,676 --> 00:15:46,743
FOR PUTTING UP TENTS.

577
00:15:46,743 --> 00:15:48,478
IT'S A LITTLE TRICKY.

578
00:15:48,478 --> 00:15:51,448
AND YOU GOT TO SMOKE A REALLY

579
00:15:51,448 --> 00:15:53,016
WEIRD PIPE BEFORE YOU CAN DO

580
00:15:53,016 --> 00:15:53,684
THIS.

581
00:15:53,684 --> 00:15:55,819
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'VE SEEN BILL DO

582
00:15:55,819 --> 00:15:57,054
THIS A FEW TIMES.

583
00:15:57,054 --> 00:16:00,891
AND I'VE NEVER BEEN TOTALLY ABLE

584
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:02,359
TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE HECK

585
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:03,527
HE DOES IT.

586
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:04,494
YOU HAVE TO WALK FUNNY TO MAKE

587
00:16:04,494 --> 00:16:05,862
IT WORK REAL WELL.

588
00:16:05,862 --> 00:16:09,032
BUT THIS ONE NOW, HE SAID HE'S

589
00:16:09,032 --> 00:16:10,200
GONNA DO A REAL WHOOP-DE-WHOOPER

590
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,867
HERE.

591
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:11,535
AND LOOK,

592
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:12,202
HE THROWS THE LINES OUT.

593
00:16:12,202 --> 00:16:13,537
AND IF YOU WATCH HIM, HE KIND OF

594
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:14,838
FLOPS HER IN THE AIR A BIT.

595
00:16:14,838 --> 00:16:19,343
IT'S KIND OF A BELLY FLOP THERE.

596
00:16:19,343 --> 00:16:20,510
IT LOOKS LIKE A BIG BOWL OF

597
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:24,081
JELL-O TENT THERE.

598
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:25,215
BUT BY GOLLY, SHE WORKS,

599
00:16:25,215 --> 00:16:26,216
DOESN'T SHE?

600
00:16:26,216 --> 00:16:29,052
AND, WELL, HE'S PROUD OF IT.

601
00:16:29,052 --> 00:16:30,320
NICE WORK, BILL.

602
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,222
SO HE'S ALL SET THERE

603
00:16:32,222 --> 00:16:34,324
AND GOT HER ALL SET UP.

604
00:16:34,324 --> 00:16:35,559
OF COURSE, IT'S ABOUT TIME FOR

605
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,194
ME TO HEAD BACK TO THE LODGE.

606
00:16:37,194 --> 00:16:38,261
SO I HAD TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO BILL

607
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:39,396
THERE.

608
00:16:39,396 --> 00:16:43,734
AND SEE YOU NEXT TIME.

609
00:16:43,734 --> 00:16:46,336
SORRY, BILL.

610
00:16:46,336 --> 00:16:47,971
"IT IS WINTER.

611
00:16:47,971 --> 00:16:49,539
A LITTLE RUM IN YOUR COFFEE,

612
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:51,241
A LITTLE WHISKEY IN YOUR TEA,

613
00:16:51,241 --> 00:16:53,343
A LITTLE ALCOHOL IN THE CAR

614
00:16:53,343 --> 00:16:55,245
WINDSHIELD WASHER FLUID,

615
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:55,912
THAT SHOULD KEEP

616
00:16:55,912 --> 00:16:57,881
EVERYONE WIPED."

617
00:17:11,161 --> 00:17:11,862
YOU KNOW,

618
00:17:11,862 --> 00:17:13,663
WE'VE HAD SOME COMMENTS

619
00:17:13,663 --> 00:17:14,898
THAT THE SHOW DOESN'T HAVE

620
00:17:14,898 --> 00:17:16,032
MUCH OF AN EDGE TO IT.

621
00:17:16,032 --> 00:17:20,704
WELL, HERE'S SOMEBODY EDGY.

622
00:17:20,704 --> 00:17:24,374
>> OKAY.

623
00:17:24,374 --> 00:17:26,510
I WONDER WHAT THE PLURAL TO

624
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:31,214
GRILLED CHEESE IS.

625
00:17:31,214 --> 00:17:35,252
WELL, ANYWAY, HOUSEHOLD CHORES.

626
00:17:35,252 --> 00:17:36,686
THE OTHER DAY, MY MOM ASKED ME

627
00:17:36,686 --> 00:17:37,854
TO CLEAN UP MY ROOM.

628
00:17:37,854 --> 00:17:40,223
[chuckles]

629
00:17:40,223 --> 00:17:41,725
YEAH, SO ANYWAY, SHE SAYS,

630
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:42,893
"HAROLD, GO CLEAN UP YOUR ROOM,"

631
00:17:42,893 --> 00:17:43,560
RIGHT?

632
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,495
AND I SAID, "MOM, HOW CAN YOU

633
00:17:45,495 --> 00:17:46,763
EXPECT ME TO CLEAN UP MY ROOM

634
00:17:46,763 --> 00:17:47,964
WHEN IT WAS YOUR GENERATION THAT

635
00:17:47,964 --> 00:17:49,299
DESTROYED THE ENVIRONMENT,

636
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:51,167
CREATED MILLIONS OF H-BOMBS AND

637
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:53,036
M-BOMBS AND A-BOMBS?

638
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:53,737
HUH?

639
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:54,471
HOW ABOUT THAT?

640
00:17:54,471 --> 00:17:56,139
AND DRUGS AND OPEN MANHOLE

641
00:17:56,139 --> 00:17:58,174
COVERS AND HATRED AND GREED AND

642
00:17:58,174 --> 00:17:59,910
INTOLERANCE, SOMETHING WHICH I

643
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,177
PERSONALLY CANNOT STAND.

644
00:18:01,177 --> 00:18:02,012
HUH?

645
00:18:02,012 --> 00:18:02,979
MOM, HOW CAN YOU DO THAT?

646
00:18:02,979 --> 00:18:03,647
DO YOU NOT SEE ANY

647
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,415
INCONSISTENCIES IN THIS AT ALL?"

648
00:18:05,415 --> 00:18:09,185
[chuckles]

649
00:18:09,185 --> 00:18:10,020
YOU KNOW WHAT?

650
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,788
I LEARNED SOMETHING THAT DAY.

651
00:18:11,788 --> 00:18:14,024
ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS.

652
00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:15,358
'CAUSE SHE JUST, LIKE,

653
00:18:15,358 --> 00:18:17,027
CLOUTED ME, RIGHT?

654
00:18:17,027 --> 00:18:18,395
SO I RACED UP TO MY ROOM, AND I

655
00:18:18,395 --> 00:18:19,996
SWEPT EVERYTHING UNDER THE BED.

656
00:18:19,996 --> 00:18:21,197
[chuckles]

657
00:18:21,197 --> 00:18:22,432
WHICH IS OKAY, 'CAUSE THAT'S

658
00:18:22,432 --> 00:18:25,368
WHERE I KEEP STUFF.

659
00:18:25,368 --> 00:18:28,038
GRILLED CHOOSE.

660
00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:28,872
OH, THAT'S NEAT.

661
00:18:28,872 --> 00:18:29,572
GRILLED CHOOSE,

662
00:18:29,572 --> 00:18:30,407
THAT WOULD BE PLURAL.

663
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:32,375
[chuckles]

664
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,443
OKAY, SORRY, I WAS WRONG ABOUT

665
00:18:33,443 --> 00:18:34,644
THAT TALENT SHOW STORY.

666
00:18:34,644 --> 00:18:35,679
I KNOW HOW EXCITED WE ARE TO

667
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:36,746
HEAR THE END OF IT.

668
00:18:36,746 --> 00:18:37,580
SO COME ON BACK

669
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,382
RIGHT AFTER THESE MESSAGES.

670
00:18:39,382 --> 00:18:44,220
CAN I HAVE MY PAYCHECK NOW?

671
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,388
THANKS.

672
00:18:45,388 --> 00:18:47,057
OH, IT'S NOT SIGNED.

673
00:18:47,057 --> 00:18:48,391
>> SORRY.

674
00:18:48,391 --> 00:18:50,693
I WAS HAVING AN ATTACK OF ENNUI.

675
00:18:59,502 --> 00:19:00,637
>> YOU KNOW, SO MANY TIMES,

676
00:19:00,637 --> 00:19:02,772
ONCE YOU GET TO BE AN ADULT,

677
00:19:02,772 --> 00:19:04,374
YOU FORGET WHAT IT WAS

678
00:19:04,374 --> 00:19:08,344
LIKE TO BE A--

679
00:19:08,344 --> 00:19:09,112
TO BE A KID.

680
00:19:09,112 --> 00:19:10,980
AND YOU REALLY SHOULD, I THINK,

681
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,782
