Welcome welcome, ladies and gentlemen, boys

Marine Museum. It's time again for the most
exciting outdoor show since Coniferous Kali's

6
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:58,124
forest crawling, bringing you the fashion
and entertainment show involving trees.

7
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:03,096
It's the one and the lonely Red Green show
starring the man who brought you like acting

8
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:08,935
to the woods and wood to his acting career a
bubbly, bubbly and irreparable Red Green.

9
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:16,609
Thank you, Harold. Thank you, and welcome to
Possum Lodge, the place that proves the

10
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:17,810
nature hates a vacuum.

11
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:23,149
We never use one. And speaking of vacuums,
Harold here is our producer and director and

12
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:25,218
all around button pusher and not just any
buttons.

13
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,887
This is my vertical flange,

14
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,290
And this is my reverse pinwheel.

15
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,860
Well, it's called an 80 year old machine,

16
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,764
A deal that spells a do, as in much ado about
nothing.

17
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,234
Anyway, it's been kind of a typical week up
at the Lodge.

18
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:44,937
Oh man, Sedgwick woke up the other day only
to find out that his pants had been stolen

19
00:01:44,937 --> 00:01:49,942
while he was sleeping. So anyway, he crawled
up out of the ditch, dusted himself off,

20
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:51,544
started hitchhiking back to the lodge.

21
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:55,915
But by golly, he was having a tough time
getting a ride because people just are

22
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,917
hesitant to stop for a guy who's got no
pants on.

23
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,687
It's just the kind of world that we live in
now, you know, people are so darn suspicious.

24
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:05,224
And then when a car would stop and the old
man, Sedgwick was a little suspicious.

25
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:07,060
I mean, who would stop with a guy with no
pants on?

26
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,963
Plus the fact that he was a little bit
confused and he'd forgotten which finger he

27
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:16,536
used to hitchhike with? Luckily, stinky
Peterson was coming by and he he picked him

28
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,404
up and drove him up to the lodger.

29
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:21,674
But by golly, old man Sedgwick was pretty
upset about the loss of his favorite Red

30
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:25,912
pants. You know, I think I might be a little
bit more upset about waking up in a ditch and

31
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,147
not having any idea as to how I got there.

32
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:30,349
Well, I'm sure he was, too.

33
00:02:30,516 --> 00:02:33,119
The first time it happened, anyway.

34
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:37,190
Old man, Sedgwick says, we got to, you know,
tighten up large security now.

35
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,992
Well, I agree with him on that, you know,
because this terrible around here,

36
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:42,528
I'm afraid to leave my valuable TV equipment.

37
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:45,198
There's no locks in the doors, there's no
doorknobs on the doors.

38
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:47,533
In some places, there's no doors where
they're supposed to be doors.

39
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:49,869
Well, Harold, I'm here.

40
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,070
We we have an expression.

41
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:52,538
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

42
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:56,008
And if it is broke, don't fix it anyway.

43
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:59,278
Yeah, no. Christmas is is our head of
security and it's all, man.

44
00:02:59,278 --> 00:03:02,481
Sedgwick has put a bug in his ear, so he's
going to be tightening everything up, but

45
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:05,851
hopefully it won't get in the way of the
great, great, fabulous super duper

46
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:07,820
extravaganza show we got for you this week.

47
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:08,588
Take it away, Harold.

48
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:12,625
You're talking about this show, OK?

49
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:19,165
Oh oh.

50
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:32,078
Is he dead? If he's dead, I'm in big
trouble.

51
00:03:35,514 --> 00:03:38,084
Oh, boy's life, OK?

52
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:39,385
All right. All right, he's alive.

53
00:03:39,518 --> 00:03:40,820
Oh, oh no, he's alive.

54
00:03:43,155 --> 00:03:45,091
How come he was not sleeping in his cabin?

55
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:47,626
He's unconscious.

56
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:51,464
Oh, OK then. Yeah, it seems somebody bash
them over the head with this club from that

57
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,999
bag. Oh boy, with you.

58
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:56,736
What's it all?

59
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,938
In my opinion, all that was an error in
judgment.

60
00:04:00,806 --> 00:04:03,743
When he wakes up, he's going to grab you by
the ankles and make a wish.

61
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:07,546
It was his fault. Oh yeah.

62
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,515
Oh yeah, use a password.

63
00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:10,983
Sure. Doesn't anybody get my memo?

64
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,118
Oh yeah, we get your memo.

65
00:04:12,284 --> 00:04:15,855
We just don't read them. You know, maybe
what you should do is send out memos saying,

66
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,123
Hey, read my memo.

67
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:18,557
Well, that's not going to work.

68
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,394
So no shooting other large member here.

69
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,763
He brained helmet with a golf club.

70
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,833
Oh, for God's sake, what is par for helmets
head?

71
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:32,338
It was his fault that he didn't use the
password.

72
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:38,377
You know, I'm just going to go get some ice
because when he wakes up, he's gonna be sore.

73
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:40,546
Woof, woof. Yeah, he's right.

74
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,615
If I was, you know, I'd be out of here.

75
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,349
When he wakes up

76
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:53,025
Starship entry to to to book a flight to Rio
India and to book a hospital room, remember

77
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:54,827
to cancel one of them. Uh-huh.

78
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,664
Oh, what happened? Someone forgot to yell
for

79
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,568
Oh, no helmet. Forgot the password.

80
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:05,671
Oh, password. There's a fun game, really.

81
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,674
It's fun. It's golf, though. Well, I'm out
of here.

82
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:16,548
Well, that's odd. My bag feels one club
later.

83
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,554
The putter is missing by the sound of it.

84
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:27,292
Oh, no, oh no.

85
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:32,498
He's our punter is missing his own putter.

86
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,868
Oh, I'm lucky, autograph.

87
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:38,037
Of these other pass through stolen.

88
00:05:41,106 --> 00:05:44,043
Oh no, lucky autograph.

89
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,378
Zeller putter has been stolen in broad
daylight.

90
00:05:48,113 --> 00:05:51,683
No, nothing. You're ahead of security.

91
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:54,019
Do something quick. I did.

92
00:05:54,486 --> 00:05:56,355
I implemented a system of passwords.

93
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:57,423
Oh good god. No.

94
00:05:57,656 --> 00:05:59,024
Oh, good old door. Good.

95
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:03,228
You find them all right. When you find them,
let me just have one minute with them alone.

96
00:06:03,395 --> 00:06:06,999
That's all I need. I will tear a divot out
of their hide the size of a throw rug.

97
00:06:08,934 --> 00:06:10,869
Five hundred bucks for that club.

98
00:06:11,403 --> 00:06:12,771
Who knows what it's worth now?

99
00:06:14,072 --> 00:06:15,674
Well, Bob, you'd be surprised.

100
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:25,551
[strumming guitar] Sometimes when I'm
sleeping outdoors at night,

101
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,553
Sometimes sometimes

102
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:31,823
I count all the stars and I can see there, you
know, inside.

103
00:06:33,825 --> 00:06:37,996
It takes a long, long, long, long, long time
and it's pretty hard.

104
00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:44,703
And I start thinking, Hey, if I'm not the one
that started the argument, why am I sleeping out

105
00:06:44,703 --> 00:06:47,343
in the yard?

106
00:06:56,014 --> 00:07:00,452
This week on the back burner, we're going to
show you what you can do with an old fridge,

107
00:07:00,886 --> 00:07:04,122
you know, fridge is kind of like a kid, even
when they don't work.

108
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:09,194
I hate to throw them out, end up sitting out
on the back porch full of beer, and the same

109
00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:10,295
thing happens to fridges.

110
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,298
So I say to myself, What do you do with an
old fridge?

111
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:14,566
Can't you make something out of that?

112
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:15,934
How about another appliance?

113
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,270
How about making it into a dishwasher?

114
00:07:18,904 --> 00:07:23,408
Ok, so the first thing you need to do is to
create a hole for your water coming in so you

115
00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:26,912
up to your fridge and you measure down about
an arm.

116
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:32,951
Ok, now you don't believe that you have a
standard size arm, you can use half a leg.

117
00:07:33,885 --> 00:07:35,387
All right. You want to just drill a hole in
there.

118
00:07:38,323 --> 00:07:39,725
Time is kind of the essence here.

119
00:07:43,395 --> 00:07:44,796
All right. Our water supply will go in
there.

120
00:07:46,998 --> 00:07:52,671
Now, as far as the water goes, just a normal
garden hose hooked up to your normal garden

121
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:53,705
hose outlet.

122
00:07:53,738 --> 00:07:54,973
We don't get fancy here. We just get
effective.

123
00:07:56,374 --> 00:08:02,347
We don't think that brings back memories.

124
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:09,855
All right, now you want to disperse the
water inside the fridge.

125
00:08:10,755 --> 00:08:13,058
You know, dishwashers have a lot of jets and
so forth.

126
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:14,125
It sprinkles water around.

127
00:08:15,427 --> 00:08:20,065
How about staying with our garden motif here
and installing a sprinkler to just leave him

128
00:08:20,065 --> 00:08:22,834
out with this up in here and maybe put this
one down on the bottom?

129
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:24,502
It's very well wide open.

130
00:08:24,536 --> 00:08:25,637
I don't like that style.

131
00:08:26,137 --> 00:08:27,205
I like to be a little more creative.

132
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:30,542
Take your hose, put a real good knot in
there

133
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:40,485
And

134
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:41,653
Then you want a water.

135
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:48,226
Seal everything up. So use duct tape on the
end of the hose, and I would even wrap duct

136
00:08:48,226 --> 00:08:50,462
tape around where the hose goes actually
into the unit.

137
00:08:51,997 --> 00:08:54,833
Now, when you turn the water on, the water's
got nowhere to go.

138
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,238
So what you do is to grab a small pointy
screwdriver, maybe just sharp knife in the

139
00:09:00,238 --> 00:09:03,775
middle and just punch a few holes right into
the hose.

140
00:09:07,612 --> 00:09:15,353
And now you're ready to throw the dishes in
there and they're covering it nicely into the

141
00:09:15,353 --> 00:09:20,425
door. If you are upset about this ugly
looking thing on the side, you can put this

142
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:24,429
side of the bridge against the wall, and I
will just put our detergent in there.

143
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:25,630
Throw that into the butter, right?

144
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:33,805
Ok. Those are up what I'm going to do.

145
00:09:33,805 --> 00:09:36,674
I'm going just a little chunk of duct tape
on there.

146
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:39,711
You know me, Mr.

147
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:41,613
Safety, OK?

148
00:09:42,947 --> 00:09:44,482
During the hose on, we can start washing
dishes.

149
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:08,439
It should be done now, I guess.

150
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,913
Oh, boy. Isn't that something?

151
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:23,288
Ok, but this just seem to have melted here.

152
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:25,456
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

153
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:34,399
All right. Maybe we made it not just just a
tad too hefty on this.

154
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,336
We might have. Maybe, maybe this was it was
a better way to go, but it works.

155
00:10:38,803 --> 00:10:42,307
I'm amazed. So remember, the women don't
find a handsome.

156
00:10:42,473 --> 00:10:44,142
They should at least find a handy.

157
00:10:45,143 --> 00:10:48,680
It's probably better for washing tools to
get to

158
00:10:49,147 --> 00:10:52,150
Point in time. So that's a pretty heavy.

159
00:10:56,421 --> 00:10:56,988
No, no, no.

160
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:12,370
It is autumn sitting in a duck blind shotgun
raised siting down the barrel, a duck floats

161
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,538
closer and closer.

162
00:11:13,838 --> 00:11:16,607
Boom, I blow its plastic head off.

163
00:11:17,642 --> 00:11:20,745
A few had been squatting here in the cold
dampness and 6:00 this morning.

164
00:11:20,778 --> 00:11:22,547
You'd be bored enough to shoot your decoys
to.

165
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,120
Errol, what's the password?

166
00:11:29,153 --> 00:11:34,792
Well, dissect well, what time is it to 30 to
30 to 30?

167
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:36,394
Ok, that's between two and three.

168
00:11:36,427 --> 00:11:38,629
So that's that's this is tomorrow's list.

169
00:11:38,663 --> 00:11:40,832
Ok. All right. Hold on.

170
00:11:41,098 --> 00:11:43,234
Hold on. Assassination.

171
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:45,136
Ok, assassination.

172
00:11:48,105 --> 00:11:52,310
Well, it's OK, I'm the red nose, not even
here hiding from Bob and Helmut.

173
00:11:52,643 --> 00:11:53,878
Oh, OK, good.

174
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:58,983
Well, Helmut is up and about, but he can't
remember his name or what he should have been

175
00:11:58,983 --> 00:12:01,118
wearing, which is the same thing.

176
00:12:01,152 --> 00:12:03,521
Helmut. Kind of an unusual name.

177
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:06,824
And, you know, I used to think his parents
were German, but it turns out they were in a

178
00:12:06,824 --> 00:12:12,129
motorcycle gang. Anyway, Bob Stuyvesant is
making everybody's life a living hell around

179
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:15,433
here. Looking for this, looking for this
putter, and it was a big deal.

180
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:21,439
It's only a putter. I mean, it's not like
it's a lucky hat anyway.

181
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:26,644
Between helmets, head and bobs, one track
mine nose caught between a rock and a hard

182
00:12:26,644 --> 00:12:27,144
place.

183
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:29,981
I sure hate to be Noel right around now.

184
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:32,283
Well, Harold, I'd hate to be you any time.

185
00:12:33,951 --> 00:12:37,288
So, Bob, is it turning the whole of upside
down and looking for this putter?

186
00:12:37,688 --> 00:12:41,492
Why is it the men get so emotional about
their possessions and cars and yet they treat

187
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:43,260
their loved ones with such indifference?

188
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:45,930
Oh, here I'll give it a rest. Will you take
some of the next segment?

189
00:12:46,263 --> 00:12:48,366
Yeah. Ok, I'll go read though, before we.

190
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,135
I was just wondering, you know, I didn't
want to ask you in front of the guys because

191
00:12:51,135 --> 00:12:54,205
I didn't want to seem like sexually naive or
something, you know?

192
00:12:54,405 --> 00:12:57,375
But I was wondering what, what, what is a
fuzzy Zeller?

193
00:12:58,242 --> 00:13:02,013
I'd say it's one of those cover things that
golfers use on their clubs to protect them.

194
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,881
Oh, oh yeah.

195
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:05,116
Well, they sell those in the Washington
school.

196
00:13:12,757 --> 00:13:14,291
How's it going, Douglas? What can I do for
you?

197
00:13:14,925 --> 00:13:15,993
No, no, no. It's rad.

198
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:17,428
Well, go jump in the water.

199
00:13:17,428 --> 00:13:19,930
It'll cool down. I'll read you.

200
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,366
Call me Douglas. No, I didn't, Glenn.

201
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:27,304
All right. All right. Well, helmet, do you
have any idea who or what hit you on the head

202
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:27,805
this morning?

203
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:30,941
Well, I don't have time for your head now.

204
00:13:30,975 --> 00:13:31,942
I got a pump here and need

205
00:13:31,942 --> 00:13:34,578
Servicing, young lady. Oh, wow.

206
00:13:34,578 --> 00:13:36,714
Well, that's good because you're one guy who
can fix things helmet.

207
00:13:37,481 --> 00:13:39,583
You know, my mom used to hit me like that.

208
00:13:39,817 --> 00:13:42,653
Help me sleep, you know, a cup of warm milk
and a two by four.

209
00:13:43,687 --> 00:13:46,056
Oh, well, how long do you think you think you
could?

210
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,558
You could straighten up this putter?

211
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:48,893
I have no idea how this happened.

212
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:51,162
Do you have a mother going,

213
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:53,998
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, I have one of those.

214
00:13:54,031 --> 00:13:55,232
You're not going to call me, Harold, are
you?

215
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:58,235
Do you call your mother?

216
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:02,439
Oh, no. A lot is a funny expression helmet.

217
00:14:02,473 --> 00:14:04,542
If you mean more than once a year, then no.

218
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:08,345
But, you know, if I called her more often, I
don't think we'd be as close.

219
00:14:08,979 --> 00:14:12,483
All right. I don't call my mom as often as I
should, either.

220
00:14:13,617 --> 00:14:14,685
You know, you have a helmet.

221
00:14:14,685 --> 00:14:15,619
You live with your mother.

222
00:14:16,153 --> 00:14:18,122
Well, that's no excuse I could call.

223
00:14:18,122 --> 00:14:20,224
I could make the time difference.

224
00:14:20,224 --> 00:14:21,425
You look like Mamie Eisenhower.

225
00:14:23,794 --> 00:14:24,561
All right.

226
00:14:24,795 --> 00:14:27,364
Yeah. Do you think you could you could
straighten that out, and Bob would really

227
00:14:27,364 --> 00:14:28,198
appreciate it, Alvin?

228
00:14:28,465 --> 00:14:29,633
Well, I don't know.

229
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:34,038
Maybe you don't want them had the chef might
just snap.

230
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:35,339
When I try to straighten it out, that'll
happen.

231
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,241
You know, mental fatigue.

232
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:40,044
If it happens, it happens.

233
00:14:40,144 --> 00:14:41,111
We got nothing to lose at this point.
Helmet?

234
00:14:42,346 --> 00:14:45,983
Ok? I was afraid that it happened.

235
00:14:47,518 --> 00:14:49,620
They just don't make them like they used to,
huh?

236
00:14:50,754 --> 00:14:51,889
I think that's one sturdy pump.

237
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:52,556
You got there, though.

238
00:14:54,058 --> 00:14:55,693
Thanks. Do you mind if I go call my mother?

239
00:14:55,893 --> 00:14:57,294
Oh, you go ahead. I'll see you later.

240
00:14:57,394 --> 00:14:58,962
Ok. Jay, how to ride for me?

241
00:14:59,897 --> 00:15:02,733
Yeah, right. And and you say hello to your
mother, right?

242
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:06,270
Hey, mom, dad says hello.

243
00:15:10,808 --> 00:15:12,876
Bell told me to meet him at the top of the
cliff there.

244
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,246
He was going to do a little rappelling, so I
thought he would be climbing up, but he was

245
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:21,718
come up, got scared that fell and really
scared me, you know?

246
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:26,356
Anyway, Bill had all the ropes, and this is
a real interesting kind of sport.

247
00:15:26,356 --> 00:15:28,091
It's I'm not sure how old this is.

248
00:15:28,392 --> 00:15:34,064
What you do is you take a piece of rope and
there's a technique, of course, a roll out,

249
00:15:34,364 --> 00:15:40,103
you know? And it's a way you wind the rope
around your body.

250
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:44,975
It's got one OK under both legs, you know,
and it goes around under and then up and

251
00:15:45,008 --> 00:15:46,376
threw up and threw up.

252
00:15:46,376 --> 00:15:47,444
And you pull that title.

253
00:15:47,778 --> 00:15:50,013
Oh, he's all right.

254
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:52,115
He's all right. Ok, you got to tell you.

255
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:56,086
Communication is a big part of the big part
of the game, as it is, as it is as it is.

256
00:15:56,386 --> 00:16:01,692
Oh, I am. So you got many minds that around
and now you drop there.

257
00:16:01,725 --> 00:16:04,828
Now he's ready to go, but you know, they'll
start to think there's something.

258
00:16:04,828 --> 00:16:07,831
He thought there was something he hadn't
done and good.

259
00:16:07,831 --> 00:16:10,434
But what it was is he'd forgotten to tie the
end to the tree,

260
00:16:11,101 --> 00:16:17,174
Which is unfortunate. Oh, I didn't know about
down there a little faster,

261
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:21,612
And then he wanted to want me to throw him
some kind of a grappling hook so that you

262
00:16:21,612 --> 00:16:24,614
could hook it on to the rope and then throw
the rope back up and we could sort of start

263
00:16:24,614 --> 00:16:26,650
over. So I didn't have a grappling hook.

264
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,052
All I had to ask was, was an anchor.

265
00:16:30,988 --> 00:16:33,090
Oh, I

266
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:38,562
Can't believe I missed him. So he he picked
up the anchor.

267
00:16:38,695 --> 00:16:42,766
Anything what he can do is tie that onto the
rope and then this way he can throw me the

268
00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:47,504
rope back up. And then I'd have and I have
the, you know, I'd have the rope.

269
00:16:47,504 --> 00:16:52,442
And then so I was a little wandering about
throwing this up.

270
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:59,149
But you know, Billy's, he's confident, you
know, with no reason to be for any.

271
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:01,685
They've been given another trial.

272
00:17:01,718 --> 00:17:06,356
She goes on this time he's going to really
be there we go all all, all, all old.

273
00:17:07,824 --> 00:17:13,864
So, you know, that's enough that he asked me
to throw him down another rope, which which

274
00:17:13,864 --> 00:17:20,003
course I did. But here again, I I hadn't
really tied it to a tree, but I was going to

275
00:17:20,003 --> 00:17:21,471
hold it and kind of balance them out.

276
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:25,742
But one way or another, we were going to get
going to get build back up the cliff.

277
00:17:26,443 --> 00:17:30,847
Once he started with the bouncing and so on,
it started to go a little better and he

278
00:17:30,847 --> 00:17:32,082
started to really make some progress.

279
00:17:32,082 --> 00:17:34,751
And pretty soon he was right up, right up,
on top.

280
00:17:34,751 --> 00:17:36,419
And. And one thing about Bill.

281
00:17:36,953 --> 00:17:38,555
He doesn't get it right the first time.

282
00:17:39,256 --> 00:17:41,825
He just he just doesn't have the brains to
quit.

283
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:48,331
So anyway, Alfie comes and got a little bit
of foliage there, and I just something to

284
00:17:48,331 --> 00:17:49,900
start a conversation on a priority, really?

285
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,401
Another wrote. Now here we go.

286
00:17:51,401 --> 00:17:53,236
Now we're going first step on a bill.

287
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,572
Tired of the tree. I'm not going to make
that mistake twice.

288
00:17:56,139 --> 00:17:58,141
Bill never makes the same mistake twice.

289
00:17:58,975 --> 00:18:02,312
He's only been married the one time and he
comes back and he's got the right.

290
00:18:02,312 --> 00:18:06,016
He's even got it wound around correctly, and
I take that off.

291
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:09,986
I didn't figure he'd want to bring in any
television stations on the way now know that

292
00:18:09,986 --> 00:18:12,622
over the nine year bill and he's all set.

293
00:18:12,622 --> 00:18:14,924
He's all set. Got her tied to the tree and
it's everything.

294
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,526
And you know, of course, now he's sensitive.

295
00:18:16,526 --> 00:18:18,895
He's got a real, real good tree there.

296
00:18:19,462 --> 00:18:23,633
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, oh, looks good, looks good
and away.

297
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,070
But you know, the thing with trees is you
can you can never tell by looking at a tree

298
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,772
just exactly how and

299
00:18:28,805 --> 00:18:29,873
Over this was.

300
00:18:31,374 --> 00:18:33,743
Oh boy, oh oh.

301
00:18:34,177 --> 00:18:40,884
Oh, boy, that one, that one that was
unfortunate, wasn't it, but he's OK, and one

302
00:18:40,884 --> 00:18:43,386
thing about Bill, he lives to repel one more
day.

303
00:18:57,066 --> 00:18:57,667
The sugar

304
00:18:57,967 --> 00:18:58,802
And turf.

305
00:19:00,437 --> 00:19:02,505
Man, what is with these violent passwords
here?

306
00:19:02,906 --> 00:19:06,376
Decapitation bazooka before that, it was
napalm ignite.

307
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:09,913
Well, I think it's all in nulls vocabulary
reflects his personality.

308
00:19:09,913 --> 00:19:12,982
You can tell a lot about a person by their
by their vocabulary, you know,

309
00:19:13,483 --> 00:19:16,586
Oh, hey, I don't be such a, you know, a guy
who knows stuff.

310
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:23,827
Smart guy. Anyway, this golf club situation
is coming to a head, an aluminum head sculpt

311
00:19:23,827 --> 00:19:25,528
around all day with Bob's putter between his
legs.

312
00:19:26,663 --> 00:19:28,998
But he said he's going to have everything
straightened out before tonight's meeting.

313
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:31,768
Well, you should just tell the truth and let
the chips fall where they may.

314
00:19:32,135 --> 00:19:34,037
Yeah, but these chips may be bits of Noel.

315
00:19:35,972 --> 00:19:37,373
It's meeting time off the rack.

316
00:19:37,407 --> 00:19:38,875
That's the call of the wild possum.

317
00:19:39,576 --> 00:19:42,712
Let's get down there because maybe like Noel
is going to be dragged off to jail or maybe

318
00:19:42,712 --> 00:19:44,314
beaten up or something like that, you know?

319
00:19:44,948 --> 00:19:48,484
You know, I don't want that to happen, but
you know, if it does, I don't want to miss

320
00:19:48,484 --> 00:19:48,785
it.

321
00:19:50,386 --> 00:19:54,123
You know, every once in a while, I get a
glimpse that there may be hope for that boy.

322
00:19:54,624 --> 00:19:55,258
Excuse me, Mac.

323
00:19:56,259 --> 00:20:00,296
Ray Ray Ray

324
00:20:06,836 --> 00:20:13,176
Rice on

325
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:22,919
The floor recognizes Bob Stuyvesant

326
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:33,196
Like the robe. Someone someone here that's
taken my putter

327
00:20:35,498 --> 00:20:39,235
and done. God knows what was that something
sick?

328
00:20:39,902 --> 00:20:45,575
I'm sure. So I've asked for help, and no one
has helped me.

329
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:50,113
No one except Noel when I needed them.

330
00:20:50,346 --> 00:20:52,348
He was there. That's right.

331
00:20:53,249 --> 00:20:55,718
Set up security checks and passwords.

332
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,456
No. Unfortunately, no one cares the way Noel
does.

333
00:21:01,591 --> 00:21:06,429
So I've decided to offer a four hundred
dollar reward for the name of the criminal

334
00:21:06,896 --> 00:21:08,664
who swiped my lucky putter.

335
00:21:08,764 --> 00:21:11,934
No, no, no.

336
00:21:12,535 --> 00:21:17,640
It's fine art.

337
00:21:17,907 --> 00:21:19,375
Don't go out.

338
00:21:19,709 --> 00:21:22,512
Hey, Noel says he can explain it.

339
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,549
Sure. No problem.

340
00:21:28,217 --> 00:21:31,487
I get it for Bob's own good buddy.

341
00:21:32,655 --> 00:21:39,729
Well, here I have some score cards from golf
games you played last week and this was not a

342
00:21:39,729 --> 00:21:46,569
lucky putter. This this is a curse putter,
and that's that autograph was not fuzzy.

343
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:48,671
It was forged.

344
00:21:49,171 --> 00:21:51,641
I checked it, forged by Satan.

345
00:21:52,742 --> 00:21:53,843
Oh, wow.

346
00:21:53,876 --> 00:22:00,349
Just like a Metallica VIDEO So I'm just
helping out there.

347
00:22:00,516 --> 00:22:03,919
You just take your reward money and buy
yourself a real lucky putter.

348
00:22:04,253 --> 00:22:08,157
I'd like that other one, you know, fun on a
lighter moment.

349
00:22:08,658 --> 00:22:13,195
I would just like to, you know, I went to
smash that thing against the Wall and it was

350
00:22:13,195 --> 00:22:16,298
so inaccurate it missed and hit the helmet
right in the head.

351
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:27,043
What? But what did I

352
00:22:27,043 --> 00:22:29,945
come over here for Douglas Douglas?

353
00:22:31,213 --> 00:22:34,183
Oh, Helmut, you were just going to do your
impression of Mamie Eisenhower?

354
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,518
And I was,

355
00:22:36,218 --> 00:22:38,954
Yeah, yeah. And you were going to dedicate it
to your mom.

356
00:22:39,388 --> 00:22:40,756
Oh, mom. Yeah, right?

357
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,192
Yeah. Yeah. So there's no no further business
bill.

358
00:22:44,226 --> 00:22:47,496
Ok, then I'm going to have now turned over
to helmet to supply the evening's

359
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:47,997
entertainment.

360
00:22:49,965 --> 00:22:55,004
Thank you. The first, I would like to
dedicate this to my mom, and I would like to

361
00:22:55,004 --> 00:22:59,508
do my rendition of Mamie Eisenhower
welcoming Dwight back from the war.

362
00:23:00,342 --> 00:23:01,911
Hi, it's me, Mamie.

363
00:23:03,612 --> 00:23:07,917
I'm glad to see Noel standing up and taking
responsibility for his lies.

364
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:10,419
I certainly hope it's not a precedent for
the rest of us, though.

365
00:23:11,086 --> 00:23:12,755
Anyway, my wife is watching.

366
00:23:12,855 --> 00:23:15,658
I'll be coming straight home after the
meeting and I'll be bringing your anniversary

367
00:23:15,658 --> 00:23:18,494
gift depending on, you know, which stores
are open.

368
00:23:19,428 --> 00:23:22,431
I know the twenty fifth is silver and the
50th is gold.

369
00:23:22,498 --> 00:23:28,537
This is our twenty ninth, which I believe is
donuts, so I'll be bringing twenty nine honey

370
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:30,272
glazed donuts or thereabouts, depending on
traffic.

371
00:23:32,207 --> 00:23:33,776
Until next time.

372
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:36,979
On behalf of myself and Harold and the whole
gang up here at Possum Lodge.

373
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:40,950
Keep your putter in your bag and oh yeah,
keep your stick on the ice.

374
00:23:44,386 --> 00:23:46,221
Ooh, where did you get those medals?

375
00:23:46,488 --> 00:23:47,690
They look very impressive.

376
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:48,824
What is that one for?

377
00:23:48,991 --> 00:23:50,492
Oh, really, you're courageous, man.

378
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:52,528
And what's that one for? Oh, you did single
handedly.

379
00:23:53,262 --> 00:23:54,163
Oh, very nice.
