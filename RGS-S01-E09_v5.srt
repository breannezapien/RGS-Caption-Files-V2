00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,451
HANDSOME, THEY SHOULD AT LEAST

180
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:54,920
FIND YOU HANDY.

181
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,488

00:06:34,326 --> 00:06:36,295
[laughter]

207
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:43,402

SCRAPBOOK LAST NIGHT,

209
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,604

>> OH, THEY'D HAVE TO BE OLD.

214
00:06:50,475 --> 00:06:51,677
>> WELL, THEY WERE NOT OLD IN

215
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:52,644
THE SENSE OF OLD, BUT JUST--

216
00:06:52,644 --> 00:06:53,312
>> OH, OKAY.

217
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:53,979

>> WHAT CAN YOU SAY?

223
00:06:58,517 --> 00:06:59,184

I CAN SAY THAT, 'CAUSE HE DOES

00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:00,652
THAT WHEN HE SINGS.

226
00:07:00,652 --> 00:07:01,320
>> HE DOES THAT?

227
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:01,987

IN THE CENTER AND JUST DOES--

233
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:07,693
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

234
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:08,560
>> GETTIN' BETWEEN THE STRINGS

235
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,227
IS THE TOUGH PART.

236
00:07:09,227 --> 00:07:09,928
>> WELL, IT'S NOT EASY.

237
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:10,595
>> NO. NO.

238
00:07:10,595 --> 00:07:11,263
>> THAT'S WHY THEY CALL

239
00:07:11,263 --> 00:07:11,930

240
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,198

00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,301
>> YOU KNOW, GUY MITCHELL--

245
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:17,002

00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:23,942
I--I--NO.

253
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:25,410
I KNEW GUY MADISON.

254
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,311
>> MADISON WHO PLAYED WILD--

255
00:07:26,311 --> 00:07:27,012
>> YEAH. WELL, YEAH.

256
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:27,813
HIS GUN'S BACKWARDS.

257
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:29,181
HE'D SAY, "SHOOT STRAIGHT

258
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:30,515
AND KEEP YOUR GUNS BACKWARDS."

259
00:07:30,515 --> 00:07:31,216
>> THAT'S SO HE CAN, LIKE,

260
00:07:31,216 --> 00:07:32,117
SHOOT PEOPLE SNEAKIN' UP

261
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:32,784
ON HIM.

262
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:33,819
>> YEAH. YEAH.

263
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:34,553
HE HAD A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT

264
00:07:34,553 --> 00:07:35,220
THOUGH.

265
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,522
HE'S--THE DARN THINGS WENT OFF.

266
00:07:37,522 --> 00:07:38,323
HE BLEW HIS BUNS OFF AT THE

267
00:07:38,323 --> 00:07:39,157
WRAP PARTY.

268
00:07:39,157 --> 00:07:40,358
>> HMM.

269
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:41,193
>> WE'VE ALL DONE THAT, EH?

270
00:07:41,193 --> 00:07:43,161
>> YEAH.

271
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:49,134
>> "IT IS WINTER.

272
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:51,570
THE WINDOWS ARE FROSTED OVER.

273
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,004
NOTHING CAN BE SEEN THROUGH

274
00:07:53,004 --> 00:07:54,406
THIS WHITE PATCHWORK OF ICE

275
00:07:54,406 --> 00:07:55,474
CRYSTALS.

276
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:57,142
THE ENTIRE WINTER WORLD IS

277
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:58,777
BLOCKED FROM VIEW,

278
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:00,045
BUT DON'T WORRY.

279
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:01,113
YOU KNOW THIS ROAD LIKE THE

280
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,081
BACK OF YOUR HAND."

281
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:05,917
SO ANYWAY,

282
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:07,419
MOOSE GOES DOWN AND APPLIES

283
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:09,321
FOR THIS JOB AS A MALE DANCER.

284
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:11,456
IT WAS AT THE BAMBOO BAM-BAM

285
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:12,624
CLUB.

286
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:13,992
HE FIGURED HE'D BE TEACHIN'

287
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:15,794
WIDOWS HOW TO FOXTROT.

288
00:08:15,794 --> 00:08:17,596
SO THEY TOLD HIM TO GO HOME

289
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:19,464
AND COME BACK AT 8:00 DRESSED

290
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:21,466
UP IN A COSTUME, LIKE AN INDIAN

291
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:22,901
OR A POLICEMAN OR ONE OF THE

292
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:24,502
VILLAGE PEOPLE.

293
00:08:24,502 --> 00:08:26,071
SO MOOSE FIGURES, YOU KNOW,

294
00:08:26,071 --> 00:08:27,305
MAYBE HE'LL SEE SOME KIND OF--

295
00:08:27,305 --> 00:08:28,173
LIKE A COSTUME BALL OR

296
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:28,840
SOMETHING.

297
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,641
SO HE'S LOOKIN' AROUND THE

298
00:08:29,641 --> 00:08:31,643
LODGE, AND HE FINDS AN OLD

299
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:33,445
MOOSE DECOY THAT WE USED ONE

300
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:35,413
TIME TO DRAW A MOOSE OUT DURING

301
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:36,081
MATING SEASON.

302
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:37,382
THAT'S ANOTHER STORY.

303
00:08:37,382 --> 00:08:39,618
SO ANYWAY, HE GETS THE FRONT

304
00:08:39,618 --> 00:08:40,885
HALF OF THE MOOSE COSTUME ON,

305
00:08:40,885 --> 00:08:42,287
BUT HE NEEDS SOMEBODY TO BE

306
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:44,289
THE OTHER HALF OF THE MOOSE,

307
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:45,557
SO THAT'S MOOSE WITH A SMALL

308
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:46,725
"M," NOT A BIG "M,"

309
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:48,660
AND BUSTER HADFIELD SAYS THAT

310
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,394
HE'D BE THE BACK END OF THE

311
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:50,061
MOOSE.

312
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:52,330
BOY, TALK ABOUT TYPE-CASTING.

313
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,732
>> UNCLE RED.

314
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:55,500
I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT,

315
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,568
YOU KNOW, SOME OF OUR VIEWERS

316
00:08:56,568 --> 00:08:59,070
HAVE CHILDREN AND TASTE,

317
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,305
AND MAYBE THEY WON'T APPRECIATE

318
00:09:00,305 --> 00:09:02,107
THIS RIVALED ADVENTURE.

319
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:03,675
>> WELL, I CAN'T HELP THAT,

320
00:09:03,675 --> 00:09:04,576
HAROLD.

321
00:09:04,576 --> 00:09:06,544
>> I CAN.

322
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:19,090
>> JACK!

323
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,892
JACK, COME ON UP HERE!

324
00:09:20,892 --> 00:09:22,861
I KNOW YOU'RE DOWN THERE, JACK!

325
00:09:29,134 --> 00:09:30,101
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT?

326
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:30,802
>> WELL, NOTHING.

327
00:09:30,802 --> 00:09:32,137
I JUST THOUGHT WE'D DROP BY,

328
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:34,572
SEE HOW IT'S GOIN', YOU KNOW?

329
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:35,807
>> OH. OH!

330
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:36,741
UH, LET ME GUESS.

331
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:37,475
>> YEAH?

332
00:09:37,475 --> 00:09:39,077
>> WESTERN CIVILIZATION HAS

333
00:09:39,077 --> 00:09:40,345
FINALLY COLLAPSED AND NOW

334
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:42,147
ALL THE SMUG KNOW-IT-ALLS

THEM IN AND GIVE THEM SHELTER

338
00:09:46,484 --> 00:09:47,352
AND SEE THEM THROUGH THE COMING

339
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:48,753
DARK AGES.

340
00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:50,221
>> WELL, UH, NO.

341
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:51,322
WE WERE JUST ON OUR WAY TO THE

342
00:09:51,322 --> 00:09:52,690
GO-KARTS ON 89,

343
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:53,925
AND WE THOUGHT WE'D JUST

344
00:09:53,925 --> 00:09:54,592
DROP BY.

345
00:09:54,592 --> 00:09:55,894
THAT'S ALL.

346
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:58,830
>> OH, OKAY.

347
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,298
>> DO YOU NEED ANYTHING, JACK?

348
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:01,466
>> I HAVE EVERYTHING I NEED,

349

350
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:02,800
I'M A SURVIVOR.

351
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,468
>> OKAY.

352
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:04,903
>> AND I DIDN'T JUST RUSH INTO

353
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:06,237
THIS IN A BLIND PANIC.

354
00:10:06,237 --> 00:10:06,905
>> OKAY.

355
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:07,639
>> I'LL TELL YOU THAT MUCH.

356
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,806
YOU KNOW, I SPENT FOUR WEEKENDS

357
00:10:08,806 --> 00:10:09,874
PLANNING THIS.

358
00:10:09,874 --> 00:10:11,476
I EVEN DREW MAPS AND BROUGHT

359
00:10:11,476 --> 00:10:12,677
HEAVY SHOES.

360
00:10:12,677 --> 00:10:13,878
>> ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

361
00:10:13,878 --> 00:10:15,914
BUT HAVE YOU GOT ENOUGH FOOD?

362
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:17,582
>> I HAVE EVERYTHING I NEED.

363
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:18,249
OKAY?

364
00:10:18,249 --> 00:10:19,317
OH, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYIN'.

365
00:10:19,317 --> 00:10:19,984
>> YEAH?

366
00:10:19,984 --> 00:10:20,652
>> FORGET IT.

367
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:21,319
FORGET IT.

368
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:22,253
I HAVE NOTHING YOU WOULD LIKE.

369
00:10:22,253 --> 00:10:23,187
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'?

370
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:24,289
I GROW EVERYTHING I NEED TO

371
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:24,956
SURVIVE.

372
00:10:24,956 --> 00:10:25,623
>> ALL RIGHT.

373
00:10:25,623 --> 00:10:26,558
>> EXCEPT MILK.

374
00:10:26,558 --> 00:10:27,325
>> OH, YEAH.

375
00:10:27,325 --> 00:10:31,696
YEAH, BUT WHAT DO YOU GROW?

376
00:10:31,696 --> 00:10:34,999
>> WELL, MUSHROOMS MOSTLY,

377
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:36,134
YOU KNOW, BUT I'VE ORDERED SOME

378
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:36,968
SEEDS, AND THEY SHOULD BE HERE

379
00:10:36,968 --> 00:10:37,635
SOON.

380
00:10:37,635 --> 00:10:38,303
>> YEAH.

381
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:39,304
>> YEAH, THEY SAID ALLOW SIX TO

382
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:41,005

BUT I'M HOPIN' THE WORLD

384
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:43,841

385
00:10:43,841 --> 00:10:45,176
BEFORE THEN, 'CAUSE I'VE

386
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:46,744

>> YOU'VE ORDERED A LOT OF

390
00:10:50,948 --> 00:10:51,683
SEEDS THEN.

391
00:10:51,683 --> 00:10:52,383
>> OH, BELIEVE IT.

00:10:56,287 --> 00:10:59,057
SURE, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

396
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:00,291
WHEN YOUR CURRENCY SYSTEM

397
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,726
COLLAPSES, YOU SEE,

398
00:11:01,726 --> 00:11:03,094
I'M GONNA TAKE THOSE SLOT CARS,

399
00:11:03,094 --> 00:11:04,829
TRADE 'EM FOR A COW,

400
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:05,997
AND THEN I'LL HAVE FRESH MEAT

401
00:11:05,997 --> 00:11:08,399
AND MILK.

402
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,333
>> WELL, ALL RIGHT.

403
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,301
WELL, OKAY, JACK.

404
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:11,602
IF THERE'S NOTHING THAT YOU

405
00:11:11,602 --> 00:11:12,770
NEED, YOU KNOW--

406
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:13,438
>> NOTHING.

407
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:14,105
I DON'T NEED ANYTHING.

00:11:23,247 --> 00:11:24,882
>> NOTHING.

415
00:11:24,882 --> 00:11:27,718
SOMETHING, BUT--SURVIVAL.

416
00:11:27,718 --> 00:11:29,020
I CAN'T TELL YOU.

417
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:29,687
>> ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

418
00:11:29,687 --> 00:11:30,621
FINE, FINE, FINE.

419
00:11:30,621 --> 00:11:31,456
JUST TELL ME THIS, WILL YOU?

420
00:11:31,456 --> 00:11:32,156
WILL YOU BE ABLE TO GIVE IT

421
00:11:32,156 --> 00:11:32,990
BACK TO US, YOU KNOW,

422
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,025
AFTER THE CURRENCY THING

423
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:35,026
COLLAPSES?

424
00:11:35,026 --> 00:11:35,793
>> SURE.

425
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:36,461
>> ALL RIGHT.

426
00:11:36,461 --> 00:11:38,129
>> I MEAN, NO!

427
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:40,998
OH, DARN.

[strumming acoustic guitar]

430
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:49,907
>> STOP THE WHALE HUNT NOW

431
00:11:49,907 --> 00:11:51,509
PUT YOUR HARPOONS AWAY

432
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:53,478
OR ELSE

433
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:55,146
STOP HUNTING WHALES

434
00:11:55,146 --> 00:11:57,048
THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO

435
00:11:57,048 --> 00:11:58,549
AND AS SOON AS HAROLD AND I

436
00:11:58,549 --> 00:11:59,283

>> WELL, UNCLE RED,

440
00:12:04,922 --> 00:12:05,590
THIS IS SO EXCITING.

441
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,257
THIS IS GREAT!

442
00:12:06,257 --> 00:12:07,124
WE GOT SOMETHING REALLY

443
00:12:07,124 --> 00:12:08,092
DIFFERENT ON THE MAIL CALL

444
00:12:08,092 --> 00:12:08,893
SEGMENT TODAY.

445
00:12:08,893 --> 00:12:09,694
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A SPIN

446
00:12:09,694 --> 00:12:10,361
ON IT.

447
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:11,896
SOMETHING JUST A TAD DIFFERENT.

448
00:12:11,896 --> 00:12:13,698
WE GOT A LETTER FROM A KID!

449
00:12:13,698 --> 00:12:14,732
THIS COULD BE HUGE!

450
00:12:14,732 --> 00:12:15,666
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

451
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:16,334
WOULDN'T THAT BE GREAT?

452
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:17,268
THIS IS--OH, THIS IS VERY

453
00:12:17,268 --> 00:12:18,336
EXCITING.

454
00:12:18,336 --> 00:12:19,770
>> JUST READ THE LETTER, HAROLD.

455
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:20,438

00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:21,105
YEAH, OKAY.

457
00:12:21,105 --> 00:12:21,772
THAT'S WHAT I MEANT.

458
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:22,740
I MEAN, I WASN'T GONNA CHANGE

459
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,474
A LOT OF THINGS.

460
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:24,909
JUST--IT'S HUGE.

461
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:25,843
WHY DON'T I READ THE LETTER

462
00:12:25,843 --> 00:12:26,877
ALREADY?

463
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:28,045
"DEAR MR. GREEN,

464
00:12:28,045 --> 00:12:29,080
I LIKE YOU.

465
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,414
YOU DO FUNNY THINGS.

466
00:12:30,414 --> 00:12:31,382
I LIKE YOU WHEN YOU HURT

467
00:12:31,382 --> 00:12:32,516
YOURSELF AND WHEN BILL SMITH

468
00:12:32,516 --> 00:12:33,451
HURTS HIMSELF,

469
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:34,552
AND WHEN YOUR NEPHEW, HAROLD,

470
00:12:34,552 --> 00:12:35,553
HURTS HIMSELF."

[laughs]

472
00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:37,154
THIS IS CUTE.

473
00:12:37,154 --> 00:12:37,855
LOOK AT THAT.

474
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:39,290
HE SPELLS NEPHEW WITH AN "F."

475
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,024
>> JUST ONE.

476
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:42,059
THAT IS CUTE.

477
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:43,160
>> "I WANT TO BE JUST LIKE YOU

478
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,061
WHEN I GROW UP.

479
00:12:44,061 --> 00:12:46,297
CAN I HAVE YOUR AUTOGRAPH?"

480
00:12:46,297 --> 00:12:47,598
>> NO, I'M SORRY, HAROLD.

481
00:12:47,598 --> 00:12:49,600
I'M USING IT.

482
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,768
EH, YOU WANT TO BE LIKE ME,

483
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:51,435
EH?

484
00:12:51,435 --> 00:12:53,404
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT THAT

485
00:12:53,404 --> 00:12:54,772
EASY HOSTING YOUR OWN

486
00:12:54,772 --> 00:12:56,040
TELEVISION SHOW.

487
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,608
IF IT WAS, HAROLD HERE WOULD

488
00:12:57,608 --> 00:12:58,376
BE DOING IT.

489
00:12:58,376 --> 00:12:59,043
>> OH, BOY.

490
00:12:59,043 --> 00:13:00,878
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

491
00:13:00,878 --> 00:13:02,079
>> AND YOU KNOW, HAROLD,

492
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,780
EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT

493
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,614
STUFF,

494
00:13:03,614 --> 00:13:05,316
AS YOU KNOW, YOU GOTTA GET

495
00:13:05,316 --> 00:13:06,584
YOUR EDUCATION.

496
00:13:06,584 --> 00:13:08,085
I MEAN, I USE ALL THOSE SUBJECTS

497
00:13:08,085 --> 00:13:09,019
EVERY DAY:

498
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:11,322
ADDING, SUBTRACTING, SOCIAL

499
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:12,957
STUDIES, METAL SHOP,

500
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:15,426
GYM, YOU KNOW,

501
00:13:15,426 --> 00:13:16,360
BECAUSE YOU NEED THE LETTERS,

502
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,595
SEE, OR YOU CAN'T READ THE

503
00:13:17,595 --> 00:13:18,462
CUE CARDS,

504
00:13:18,462 --> 00:13:19,964
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO RELY ON

505
00:13:19,964 --> 00:13:22,700
YOUR MEMORY.

506
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,869
I GUESS THAT'S ABOUT IT.

507
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:26,103
WHERE WAS I, DO YOU KNOW?

508
00:13:26,103 --> 00:13:27,204
>> YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT

509
00:13:27,204 --> 00:13:28,339
EDUCATION.

510
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:29,073
IT WAS VERY EXCITING TO SEE

511
00:13:29,073 --> 00:13:30,007
YOU TAKE A STAND ON THAT,

512
00:13:30,007 --> 00:13:30,674
UNCLE RED.

513
00:13:30,674 --> 00:13:31,809
WE SHOULD ALSO MENTION TO OUR

514
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:32,910
VIEWERS ABOUT COLLEGE AND

515
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,211
UNIVERSITY.

516
00:13:34,211 --> 00:13:35,112
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW

517
00:13:35,112 --> 00:13:36,247
ABOUT THAT, HAROLD.

518
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:38,082
I THINK COLLEGE EDUCATION IS

519
00:13:38,082 --> 00:13:40,918
A DRAWBACK FOR BEING A TV STAR.

520
00:13:40,918 --> 00:13:43,687
MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT THINGS.

521
00:13:43,687 --> 00:13:44,989
AS FOR UNIVERSITY, WELL, THAT'S

522
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:46,590
JUST A BUNCH OF EGGHEADS

523
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,992
WALKIN' AROUND BETWEEN THE

524
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:49,793
TREES SAYIN' THINGS LIKE,

525
00:13:49,793 --> 00:13:51,762
"HENCE" AND "THEREFORE."

526
00:13:51,762 --> 00:13:52,696
>> OH, NO, UNCLE RED.

527
00:13:52,696 --> 00:13:53,731
IF I MIGHT JUST STEP BACK A

528
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:54,565
STEP OR TWO,

529
00:13:54,565 --> 00:13:55,466
IN MY OPINION,

530
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:56,700
EDUCATION IS VERY IMPORTANT.

531
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,768
WE SHOULD BE STRESSING TO OUR

532
00:13:57,768 --> 00:13:59,904
VIEWERS TO GO ON TO COLLEGE.

533
00:13:59,904 --> 00:14:00,871
LEARN AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.

534
00:14:00,871 --> 00:14:03,574
THAT'S MY OPINION.

535
00:14:03,574 --> 00:14:04,308
>> WELL, HOW CAN WE DO THAT,

536
00:14:04,308 --> 00:14:05,175
HAROLD?

537
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:06,544
I DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE AND

538
00:14:06,544 --> 00:14:08,012
YOU DIDN'T GO COLLEGE,

539
00:14:08,012 --> 00:14:11,815
AND LOOK AT US.

540
00:14:11,815 --> 00:14:13,918
>> WE'RE SELF-MADE MEN.

541
00:14:13,918 --> 00:14:16,020
>> OH, SURE, BLAME ME.

542
00:14:20,758 --> 00:14:22,226
THIS WEEK ON "ADVENTURES WITH

543
00:14:22,226 --> 00:14:23,360
BILL," WE'RE GONNA DEAL WITH

544
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,895
A PROBLEM THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE

545
00:14:24,895 --> 00:14:25,829
HAVE IN THE WOODS,

546
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:28,565
AND THAT IS MOSQUITOES.

547
00:14:28,565 --> 00:14:30,000
THEY DON'T BOTHER ME.

548
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,768
MIND YOU, I HAVE FLIES IN MY

549
00:14:30,768 --> 00:14:32,236
PANTS...[chuckles]

550
00:14:32,236 --> 00:14:34,672
AS YOU SEE, BILL HAS A REAL

551
00:14:34,672 --> 00:14:35,439
PROBLEM WITH THEM.

552
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:36,907
THEY SEEM TO JUST--THERE ARE

553
00:14:36,907 --> 00:14:37,574
PEOPLE LIKE THIS.

554
00:14:37,574 --> 00:14:40,110
THEY JUST SEEM TO GO FOR 'EM.

555
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,045
QUITE A FEW OF THEM GOING FOR

556
00:14:41,045 --> 00:14:43,280
BILL IN THIS PARTICULAR...

557
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,915
[laughter]

558
00:14:44,915 --> 00:14:46,450
SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

559
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,484
IS SHOW YOU SOME OF THE VARIOUS

560
00:14:47,484 --> 00:14:49,553
WAYS THAT YOU CAN PROTECT

561
00:14:49,553 --> 00:14:51,321
YOURSELF FROM THE MOSQUITOS

562
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:53,290
OR BLACK FLIES OR GNATS OR

563
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,491
PTERODACTYLS OR WHATEVER IT IS

564
00:14:54,491 --> 00:14:55,459
THAT COMES AFTER YOU.

565
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:57,461
THIS IS TAKING SOME VINYL

566
00:14:57,461 --> 00:14:58,929
SCREENING AND JUST WRAPPING

567
00:14:58,929 --> 00:14:59,997
YOURSELF UP IN THE SCREEN,

568
00:14:59,997 --> 00:15:00,731
LIKE MAKE YOURSELF INTO A

569
00:15:00,731 --> 00:15:03,467
PORCH, REALLY.

570
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:05,169
THIS IS BILL'S OWN IDEA,

571
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:07,271
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU WANT TO GIVE

572
00:15:07,271 --> 00:15:08,205
THAT A REAL GOOD TUG.

573
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:09,206
YOU COULD PROBABLY START HIM

574
00:15:09,206 --> 00:15:09,907
UP LIKE A LAWN MOWER,

575
00:15:09,907 --> 00:15:10,607
YOU KNOW?

576
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:11,542
[laughs]

577
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:12,376
I DON'T THINK THIS ONE IS

578
00:15:12,376 --> 00:15:13,911
VERY EFFECTIVE.

579
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:14,578
THIS IS ANOTHER.

580
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:15,646
THIS IS A CONCOCTION MADE UP

581
00:15:15,646 --> 00:15:17,214
OF LEMON JUICE AND HONEY,

582
00:15:17,214 --> 00:15:17,881
I BELIEVE IT IS,

583
00:15:17,881 --> 00:15:20,017
AND ACCORDING TO BILL'S

584
00:15:20,017 --> 00:15:20,684
GRANDMOTHER,

585
00:15:20,684 --> 00:15:22,319
I THINK SHE SAID,

586
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:23,587
THIS WORKS REAL WELL.

587
00:15:23,587 --> 00:15:24,388
COME ON, SHE WAS COVERED WITH

588
00:15:24,388 --> 00:15:26,857
BEE STINGS.

589
00:15:26,857 --> 00:15:28,091
AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE DISCOVERED,

590
00:15:28,091 --> 00:15:29,193
UNFORTUNATELY, WAS THAT THIS

591
00:15:29,193 --> 00:15:31,094
ACTUALLY ATTRACTED THE

592
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:32,763
MOSQUITOS.

593
00:15:32,763 --> 00:15:34,031
WELL, IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE.

594
00:15:34,031 --> 00:15:36,500
IT COULD HAVE BEEN ON ME.

595
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,769
AND NOW THIS IS MORE OF THE

596
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:41,371
UNUSUAL APPROACH.

597
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:42,439
HE'S MADE HIMSELF COMPLETELY

598
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:43,774
AIRTIGHT WITH SOME TAPE AND

599
00:15:43,774 --> 00:15:44,808
A BUG JACKET,

600
00:15:44,808 --> 00:15:46,176
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THERE'S

601
00:15:46,176 --> 00:15:48,612
A MOSQUITO IN THERE WITH HIM.

602
00:15:48,612 --> 00:15:51,148
NOW IT'S UP IN THE ARM.

603
00:15:51,148 --> 00:15:53,383
UP IN THE ARM.

604
00:15:53,383 --> 00:15:54,718
YOU CAN'T SEE IT, OF COURSE,

605
00:15:54,718 --> 00:15:55,586
'CAUSE IT'S INSIDE.

606
00:15:55,586 --> 00:15:56,653
IT'S OVER HERE NOW.

607
00:15:56,653 --> 00:15:57,888
IT'S IN THE--IT'S IN THE JACKET,

608
00:15:57,888 --> 00:16:00,657
SO I'LL--I THOUGHT I SAW IT

609
00:16:00,657 --> 00:16:01,758
GO BY HIS FACE.

610
00:16:01,758 --> 00:16:03,727
OH!

611
00:16:03,727 --> 00:16:05,796
I GOT IT.

612
00:16:05,796 --> 00:16:07,331
NOW, THIS IS THE CONVENTIONAL

613
00:16:07,331 --> 00:16:07,998
METHOD.

614
00:16:07,998 --> 00:16:09,333
THESE ARE THE AEROSOL CANS

615
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,134
WITH THE C.F.F--

616
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:13,036
C.F.F.--C.F.F'S IN THEM

617
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:14,538
THAT THEY'RE PUNCHIN' A HOLE

618
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:15,572
OVER THE ANTARCTIC.

619
00:16:15,572 --> 00:16:16,740
WHO CARES, YOU KNOW?

620
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,709
ANYWAY, I'M GONNA BE USING

621
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:20,577
THE DOUBLE DOSE HERE ON BILL--

622
00:16:20,577 --> 00:16:21,912
>> [yells]

623
00:16:21,912 --> 00:16:23,113
>> YOU KNOW, THEY SAY THERE--

624
00:16:23,113 --> 00:16:25,382
IT'S A NERVE GAS OR SOMETHING

625
00:16:25,382 --> 00:16:29,386
THAT IT CAN ACTUALLY COMPLETELY

626
00:16:29,386 --> 00:16:31,321
DESTROY THE HUMAN MIND,

627
00:16:31,321 --> 00:16:32,856
WHICH I DIDN'T REALIZE BILL

628
00:16:32,856 --> 00:16:34,024
WAS EQUIPPED WITH,

629
00:16:34,024 --> 00:16:36,493
SO I WAS--THAT WAS A LITTLE

630
00:16:36,493 --> 00:16:38,328
CRUEL, I THINK, ON MY PART,

631
00:16:38,328 --> 00:16:40,697
BUT FUN.

632
00:16:40,697 --> 00:16:41,765
SO BILL SHOWED US SOME OF THE

633
00:16:41,765 --> 00:16:42,466
OTHERS.

634
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:43,567
THESE ARE VARIOUS HAND LOTIONS.

635
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:46,036
I THINK AVON HAS ONE AND SO ON.

636
00:16:46,036 --> 00:16:47,137
THEY WORK REAL WELL IN THE

637
00:16:47,137 --> 00:16:47,804
WOODS.

638
00:16:47,804 --> 00:16:49,539
APPARENTLY THEY WORK AS WELL

639
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:51,174
AS ANY BUG REPELLANT.

640
00:16:51,174 --> 00:16:52,642
AND WHAT YOU DO IS YOU JUST--YOU

641
00:16:52,642 --> 00:16:53,543
HOLD OUT YOUR HAND THERE AND

642
00:16:53,543 --> 00:16:54,344
JUST PUT IT ON THERE,

643
00:16:54,344 --> 00:16:55,011
AND...

644
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:57,748
[makes squirting noise]

645
00:16:57,748 --> 00:16:58,782
I DON'T KNOW.

646
00:16:58,782 --> 00:16:59,883
I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT HAPPENED,

647
00:16:59,883 --> 00:17:01,952
BUT I GUESS HE HAD IT SET FOR

648
00:17:01,952 --> 00:17:03,720
SPRINKLE OR--ANYWAY, I MANAGED

649
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,788
TO CLEAN THE MOST OF IT OFF

650
00:17:04,788 --> 00:17:06,757
MYSELF.

651
00:17:07,457 --> 00:17:09,025
"IT IS WINTER.

652
00:17:09,025 --> 00:17:11,361
MY SKIES SWOOSH UNDER ME.

653
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:13,563
MY FEET THROWN LEFT AND RIGHT.

654
00:17:13,563 --> 00:17:15,499
I STRUGGLE TO STAY UPRIGHT.

655
00:17:15,499 --> 00:17:16,700
I'M OUT OF CONTROL,

656
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,235
GOING TOO FAST.

657
00:17:18,235 --> 00:17:19,636
FALLING, SLIPPING ON THE

658
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:21,204
EDGE OF DISASTER.

659
00:17:21,204 --> 00:17:23,173
I HATE THESE T-BARS."

660
00:17:36,953 --> 00:17:38,522
ALL RIGHT, AT THIS POINT

661
00:17:38,522 --> 00:17:40,690
IN THE SHOW WE LIKE TO HAVE

662
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:41,725
A FEATURE WHERE YOU CAN KIND OF

663
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:43,093
GET TO KNOW HAROLD AND THE

664
00:17:43,093 --> 00:17:44,728
YOUNG PEOPLE OF TODAY AND THE

665
00:17:44,728 --> 00:17:46,696
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO.

666
00:17:49,466 --> 00:17:50,734
>> PROGRESS.

667
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:52,235
FRIEND OR FOE?

668
00:17:52,235 --> 00:17:54,271
I DON'T THINK SO.

669
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:55,906
SHOULD THINGS BE EXPECTED TO

670
00:17:55,906 --> 00:17:58,074
GET BIGGER EVERY YEAR?

671
00:17:58,074 --> 00:18:00,343
THINK ABOUT YOUR AUNT.

672
00:18:00,343 --> 00:18:01,478
OH.

673
00:18:01,478 --> 00:18:03,647
[laughs]

674
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,115
MAYBE THINGS ARE OKAY.

675
00:18:05,115 --> 00:18:06,449
MAYBE THINGS SHOULD JUST STAY

676
00:18:06,449 --> 00:18:08,318
THE SAME OR GET A LITTLE WORSE.

677
00:18:08,318 --> 00:18:09,452
HEAR ME OUT, OKAY?

678
00:18:09,452 --> 00:18:10,153
HEAR ME OUT.

679
00:18:10,153 --> 00:18:11,421
HEAR ME OUT.

680
00:18:11,421 --> 00:18:12,622
OKAY, OKAY.

681
00:18:12,622 --> 00:18:13,723
IMPLYING THAT THINGS SHOULD

682
00:18:13,723 --> 00:18:15,592
GET BETTER EVERY YEAR SAYS THAT

683
00:18:15,592 --> 00:18:17,327
MAYBE SOMETHING WAS BAD.

684
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:19,129
WELL, MAYBE IT WASN'T BAD.

685
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:20,297
MAYBE IT WAS GOOD.

686
00:18:20,297 --> 00:18:21,898
MAYBE IT WAS SO GOOD THAT IT

687
00:18:21,898 --> 00:18:23,667
COULD ONLY GET BAD.

688
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:25,235
THAT COULD HAPPEN, RIGHT?

689
00:18:25,235 --> 00:18:26,469
THAT COULD HAPPEN, SURE.

690
00:18:26,469 --> 00:18:28,138
AND I'VE LEARNED TO ACCEPT THAT.

691
00:18:28,138 --> 00:18:29,439
I DON'T--I DON'T THINK THAT THE

692
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:31,975
OLDER GENERATION HAS, THOUGH.

693
00:18:31,975 --> 00:18:33,910
NO, I DON'T THINK THAT AT ALL.

694
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,578
AND IF YOU AGREE WITH ME

695
00:18:35,578 --> 00:18:36,613
THAT THAT COULD HAPPEN,

696
00:18:36,613 --> 00:18:37,814
THAT THAT COULD HAPPEN IN

697
00:18:37,814 --> 00:18:38,815
THIS LIFETIME,

698
00:18:38,815 --> 00:18:39,716
WOULD YOU PLEASE PHONE MY

699
00:18:39,716 --> 00:18:40,817
PARENTS AND TELL THEM THAT

700
00:18:40,817 --> 00:18:41,918
"D" MINUS IS NOT TECHNICALLY

701
00:18:41,918 --> 00:18:44,020
FAILING A COURSE?

702
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,656
PLEASE?

703
00:18:46,656 --> 00:18:47,490
>> DON'T GO AWAY.

704
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,458
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE

705
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,859

AND THE SPIN-TINGLING

707
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,162
CONCLUSION OF THE STORY OF

708
00:18:52,162 --> 00:18:54,330
MOOSE THOMPSON, DANCING BUFF.

709
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,466
>> THAT'S SHORT FOR "BUFFOON."

710
00:19:04,307 --> 00:19:04,974
>> IF ANY OF YOU HAVE A

711
00:19:04,974 --> 00:19:05,875
TEENAGER IN YOUR HOUSE,

712
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:06,643
I'D LIKE TO HAVE A WORD WITH

713
00:19:06,643 --> 00:19:07,444
YOU,

714
00:19:07,444 --> 00:19:10,346
UNLESS YOU'RE JERRY LEE LEWIS.

715
00:19:10,346 --> 00:19:11,080
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING

716
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,981
THAT YOU NEED TO REMEMBER

717
00:19:11,981 --> 00:19:12,916
WITH A TEENAGER,

718
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:13,683
AND THAT IS THAT EVERY ONE OF

719
00:19:13,683 --> 00:19:15,885
'EM NEEDS A SHOWER.

720
00:19:15,885 --> 00:19:16,820
SOME OF 'EM ACTUALLY NEED

721
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,587
A COLD SHOWER.

722
00:19:17,587 --> 00:19:18,488
SOME OF 'EM SHOULD BE DIPPED

723
00:19:18,488 --> 00:19:20,323
IN ICE.

724
00:19:20,323 --> 00:19:21,391
YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR KID CLEAN,

725
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:22,125
AND YOU WANT TO KEEP 'EM

726
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,560
AT HOME.

727
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,527
YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR KID OUT

728
00:19:24,527 --> 00:19:25,962

KEEP 'EM IN THE SHOWER AS

732
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:30,967
MUCH AS YOU CAN, AND MAKE

733
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:32,936
SURE THEY'RE ALONE.

734
00:19:34,504 --> 00:19:36,206
WE'RE OUT HERE ON LOCATION WITH

735
00:19:36,206 --> 00:19:39,108
MY GOOD BUDDY DOUGIE FRANKLIN

736
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:42,312
AND WHAT HAS TO BE MORE TRUCK

737
00:19:42,312 --> 00:19:44,047
THAN I EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE.

738
00:19:44,047 --> 00:19:46,015
>> WELL, RED, YOU GOTTA HAVE

739
00:19:46,015 --> 00:19:47,951
YOURSELF A BIG TRUCK

740
00:19:47,951 --> 00:19:48,885
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE CRUSHIN'

741
00:19:48,885 --> 00:19:52,355
CARS, AND, YOU KNOW,

742
00:19:52,355 --> 00:19:54,290
CRUSHIN' CARS, IT'S FULFILLING.

743
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,491
IT'S A FULFILLING JOB,

744
00:19:55,491 --> 00:19:56,559
BUT YOU GOTTA TAKE IT IN

745
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,226
PERSPECTIVE.

746
00:19:57,226 --> 00:20:00,163
IT'S ONLY ONE SMALL FACET

747
00:20:00,163 --> 00:20:02,732
OF THE TRULY--THE TRULY

748
00:20:02,732 --> 00:20:05,335
BALANCED EXISTENCE,

749
00:20:05,335 --> 00:20:06,469
AND IT SHOULD BE TREATED AS

750
00:20:06,469 --> 00:20:08,104
SUCH.

751
00:20:08,104 --> 00:20:09,472
>> WELL, NOW, THIS IS AN

752
00:20:09,472 --> 00:20:11,174
EXCELLENT MESSAGE TO THE YOUNG

753
00:20:11,174 --> 00:20:13,843
PEOPLE OF TODAY, DOUGIE.

754
00:20:13,843 --> 00:20:15,345
DRIVING A MONSTER TRUCK IS

755
00:20:15,345 --> 00:20:17,480
JUST NOT THE BE-ALL AND END-ALL.

756
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,281
>> NO.

757
00:20:18,281 --> 00:20:19,415
OH, YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN,

758
00:20:19,415 --> 00:20:20,083
RED.

759
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:23,686
I MEAN, THERE'S POLISHING HER.

760
00:20:23,686 --> 00:20:24,687
POLISHING HER UP.

761
00:20:24,687 --> 00:20:26,823
THERE'S ADDING STUFF TO HER,

762
00:20:26,823 --> 00:20:28,224
LIKE THEM LIGHTS UP THERE.

763
00:20:28,224 --> 00:20:29,392
THEY DIDN'T COME STOCK.

764
00:20:29,392 --> 00:20:30,593
I PUT THOSE ON MYSELF.

765
00:20:30,593 --> 00:20:31,394
>> AH. ALL RIGHT.

766
00:20:31,394 --> 00:20:32,061
>> THEN, YOU KNOW--

767
00:20:32,061 --> 00:20:35,164
THEN THERE'S PAYING FOR IT TOO.

768
00:20:35,164 --> 00:20:35,832
THAT'S A CHALLENGE,

769
00:20:35,832 --> 00:20:36,499
AND THE YOUNG FOLKS,

770
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:37,500
THEY NEED A CHALLENGE TODAY,

771
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,167
RED.

772
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:39,535
>> YEAH. YEAH, THEY DO.

773
00:20:39,535 --> 00:20:40,670
YOU JUST KNOW SO DARN MUCH

774
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,337
ABOUT TRUCKS.

775
00:20:41,337 --> 00:20:42,472
>> WELL, YOU KNOW,

776
00:20:42,472 --> 00:20:43,706
YOU TAKE HER APART SO MANY

777
00:20:43,706 --> 00:20:46,609
TIMES AND PUT HER BACK TOGETHER,

778
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:48,044
AND IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

779
00:20:48,044 --> 00:20:49,078
BEFORE YOU FIGURE WHAT THEM

780
00:20:49,078 --> 00:20:50,279
EXTRA PARTS IS YOU GOT

781
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:51,047
LEFT OVER,

782
00:20:51,047 --> 00:20:52,014
AND, OR COURSE, YOU GOT TO TAKE

783
00:20:52,014 --> 00:20:53,282
HER ALL APART AGAIN,

784
00:20:53,282 --> 00:20:54,550
AND AFTER A WHILE, YOU KNOW

785
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,452
ALL ABOUT IT.

786
00:20:56,452 --> 00:20:57,553
THAT DOES MAKES SENSE.

787
00:20:57,553 --> 00:20:58,287
IT DOES MAKE SENSE.

788
00:20:58,287 --> 00:20:58,988
>> ARE YOU GONNA START HER

789
00:20:58,988 --> 00:20:59,655
UP FOR US?

790
00:20:59,655 --> 00:21:00,423
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA SAY

791
00:21:00,423 --> 00:21:01,090
THAT.

792
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:01,791
>> I WAS GONNA SAY IT.

793
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:02,558
>> I LOVE THAT YOU'RE GONNA DO

794
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:03,226
THAT.

795
00:21:03,226 --> 00:21:04,127
>> YOU KNOW, THERE'S A VIBRATION

796
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,794
GOING ON HERE TODAY.

797
00:21:04,794 --> 00:21:05,461
ISN'T THERE?

798
00:21:05,461 --> 00:21:06,696
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE PICKIN' UP

799
00:21:06,696 --> 00:21:07,363
ON THE BEACH.

800
00:21:07,363 --> 00:21:08,130
>> LOVE YOU, BIG GUY.

801
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,131

AND I'LL JUST TELL YOU AS

805
00:21:12,034 --> 00:21:13,135
I START HER AND GO THROUGH

806
00:21:13,135 --> 00:21:14,570
THE OPERATION OF HER.

807
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,238
OKAY?

808
00:21:15,238 --> 00:21:16,005
>> WELL, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

809
00:21:16,005 --> 00:21:16,772
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD

810
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:17,440
TO THIS.

>> ALL RIGHTY.

814
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,177
>> GREAT.

815
00:21:21,177 --> 00:21:22,044
>> WE GOT IGNITION.

816
00:21:22,044 --> 00:21:22,945

WELL, THAT'S ABOUT HER IN A

824
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:46,002
NUTSHELL, RED.

YOU'RE REALLY PRETTY WELL.

I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO KNOW

828
00:21:48,537 --> 00:21:50,139
ANY MORE TO TAKE THIS BABY OUT.

829
00:21:50,139 --> 00:21:51,807
>> NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

830
00:21:51,807 --> 00:21:53,376
IT'S DOUGIE FRANKLIN,

831
00:21:53,376 --> 00:21:54,477
A MAN OF FEW WORDS.

832
00:21:54,477 --> 00:21:56,045
>> I THINK MAYBE I SHOULD--

833
00:21:56,045 --> 00:21:57,113
I HEARD--WHEN SHE WAS GOING

834
00:21:57,113 --> 00:21:58,014
THERE, I SHUT HER DOWN.

835
00:21:58,014 --> 00:21:58,781
I WAS HEARING A BIT OF A TICK.

836
00:21:58,781 --> 00:21:59,582
I THINK I'LL JUST START HER UP

837
00:21:59,582 --> 00:22:00,249
ONE MORE TIME.

838
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:01,117
>> START HER UP AGAIN?

839
00:22:01,117 --> 00:22:01,917
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

840
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:03,019
I MEAN, WE'VE HEARD--

841
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:03,953
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO--

842

EDIFICATION.

844
00:22:05,855 --> 00:22:06,789
YOU CAN CARRY ON WITH WHAT

YOU'RE DOING.

THE BATTERY'S GOING ON ME.

848

849
00:22:15,598 --> 00:22:17,566
THERE IS A GOD.

SO ANYWAY,

851

AND THEY COME OUT ON STAGE

857
00:22:32,314 --> 00:22:33,883
IN THE FRONT OF ABOUT 400

858
00:22:33,883 --> 00:22:35,451
REVVED-UP WOMEN WHO'VE PAID

859
00:22:35,451 --> 00:22:36,118
20 BUCKS EACH,

860
00:22:36,118 --> 00:22:38,220
AND IT ISN'T TO SEE COSTUMES.

861
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,989
THE STEREOS PUMPIN' AWAY THERE,

862
00:22:39,989 --> 00:22:40,856
AND THE TWO OF THEM ARE

863
00:22:40,856 --> 00:22:42,158
STAGGERING AROUND ON THE STAGE,

864
00:22:42,158 --> 00:22:44,560
AND SUDDENLY MOOSE'S FOOT

865
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,694
CATCHES THE COSTUME AND RIPS

866
00:22:45,694 --> 00:22:46,462
A BIG HOLE IN IT.

867
00:22:46,462 --> 00:22:48,364
WELL, THE WOMEN GO WILD,

868
00:22:48,364 --> 00:22:49,498
AND THEY'RE TRYING TO SEE WHY

869
00:22:49,498 --> 00:22:50,499
THEY CALL HIM MOOSE WITH A BIG

870
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:52,401
"M," AND GOLLY,

871
00:22:52,401 --> 00:22:53,669
THEY'RE GOING NUTS IN THERE,

872
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:54,603
AND THEY'RE HOLDIN' UP

873
00:22:54,603 --> 00:22:56,071
$10 BILLS AND YELLING,

874
00:22:56,071 --> 00:22:56,739
"TAKE IT OFF,"

875
00:22:56,739 --> 00:22:57,940
AND SUDDENLY BUSTER AND MOOSE

876
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,208
REALIZE WHAT'S GOING ON,

877
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:00,276
BECAUSE THEY WERE SITTIN' IN

878
00:23:00,276 --> 00:23:01,811
THOSE SAME SEATS A WEEK EARLIER

879
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:03,245
HOLDIN' UP $5 BILLS WHEN IT

880
00:23:03,245 --> 00:23:04,713
WAS LADIES NIGHT.

881
00:23:04,713 --> 00:23:06,048
IT SUDDENLY STRUCK THEM THAT

882
00:23:06,048 --> 00:23:07,316
THIS FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT

883
00:23:07,316 --> 00:23:08,817
WAS TAWDRY AND EXPLOITIVE

884
00:23:08,817 --> 00:23:11,120
AND DARN PROFITABLE.

885
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,820
WELL, GOLLY.

886
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,821
THE TWO OF THEM COME HOME

887
00:23:12,821 --> 00:23:13,923
FROM THERE AND THEY HAD

888
00:23:13,923 --> 00:23:16,158
THEIR UNDERWEAR FULL OF MONEY,

889
00:23:16,158 --> 00:23:18,093
WHICH NO BANK WILL TOUCH.

890
00:23:18,093 --> 00:23:20,629
BUT ANYWAY IT WAS A GREAT TIME,

891
00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:22,097
AND IF MY WIFE IS WATCHIN',

892
00:23:22,097 --> 00:23:23,165
I'M COMING STRAIGHT HOME,

893
00:23:23,165 --> 00:23:24,233
AND THERE IS NOTHING IN MY

894
00:23:24,233 --> 00:23:25,401
UNDERWEAR THAT WASN'T THERE

895
00:23:25,401 --> 00:23:26,802
WHEN I LEFT THIS MORNING.

896
00:23:26,802 --> 00:23:30,272
SO ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND--

897
00:23:30,272 --> 00:23:31,740
>> HAROLD.

898
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,908
>> THAT SAYS IT ALL FOR ME,

899
00:23:32,908 --> 00:23:34,176
AND THE REST OF US UP HERE AT

900
00:23:34,176 --> 00:23:35,077
THE LODGE,

901
00:23:35,077 --> 00:23:37,479
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.
