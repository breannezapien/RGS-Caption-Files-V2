1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,271
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

2
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:08,208
IF IT WALKS, TALKS,
AND ACTS LIKE A DUCK,

3
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:10,577
AND IS CARRYING
A SEIZED-UP CHAINSAW,

4
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:12,712
YOU'D BETTER DUCK BECAUSE

5
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:15,982
IT'S PROBABLY YOUR HERO,
MY UNCLE, RED GREEN!

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:20,086
(Applause and cheering)

7
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:21,588
THANK YOU.

8
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:23,490
(Cheering and whistling)

9
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:24,924
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

10
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:26,593
VERY EXCITING DAY HERE.

11
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:27,927
I GOT THIS FROM

12
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:29,562
THE INCOME TAX DEPARTMENT.

13
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:31,464
WE'RE LOOKIN' AT A REFUND.

14
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,066
YEAH,
RIGHT, UNCLE RED.

15
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,434
YOU HAVE TO PAY TAX

16
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,169
BEFORE YOU GET A REFUND.

17
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:38,338
NOT IF YOU GOT
A GOOD ACCOUNTANT.

18
00:00:38,404 --> 00:00:39,672
NO, NO, NO, NO.

19
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,107
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

20
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:45,111
YOU GOTTA PAY IN BEFORE
YOU CAN GET ANYTHING BACK.

21
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:48,281
YOU'RE CONFUSING THE WORD
"FILING" WITH "CHEATING".

22
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:52,118
YOU'RE CONFUSING THE WORD
"NEPHEW" WITH "WHO CARES?"

23
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:53,620
STICK AROUND, FOLKS.

24
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:57,423
I'M GONNA SHARE THIS
WITH YOU -- THE NEWS, THAT IS.

25
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,958
OHHH...

26
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:03,963
(Horns honking)

27
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,766
(Geese honking)

28
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:10,670
(Quacking)

29
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,708
(Red): YOU'RE LOOKIN'
AT SEGMENTS

30
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:17,644
FROM THIS PARTICULAR SHOW,

31
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,512
THE MAIN MESSAGE BEING,
FOR GOSH SAKES,

32
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,648
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT CHANGING THE CHANNEL.

33
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:25,151
YOU WANNA MAKE SENSE
OUT OF THIS PROGRAMME,

34
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:27,787
YOU GOTTA GIVE IT
YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.

35
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,595
THAT'S GOOD, HAROLD.

36
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,096
(Grunting)

37
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:39,432
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH...

38
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:40,767
LOOK WHAT WE GOT.

39
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,235
THERE'S A REFUND CHEQUE.

40
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:44,771
LOOK AT THAT --
THAT'S A REFUND CHEQUE,

41
00:01:44,837 --> 00:01:46,372
EXACTLY AS I PREDICTED.

42
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,409
YOU GOTTA PAY INCOME TAX
BEFORE YOU CAN EXPECT A REFUND.

43
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:51,144
IT'S A GREAT COUNTRY, ISN'T IT?

44
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,478
LET'S SEE HOW GREAT.

45
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:53,813
GIVE ME A HAND.

46
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,381
THERE WE GO, THERE WE GO.

47
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,884
$11.43 -- NOT BAD, NOT BAD.

48
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,886
THAT'S A FLY DROPPING.

49
00:01:59,952 --> 00:02:01,387
TRY THAT AGAIN.

50
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,889
$1,143?!

51
00:02:02,955 --> 00:02:04,390
WHAT?! NO!

52
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,892
OH, MAN!

53
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,393
WHOA! WHOA!

54
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,695
THAT'S WRONG! THAT'S A MISTAKE!

55
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:12,231
THAT'S A MISTAKE,
THAT'S A MISTAKE!

56
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,066
I'M PHONING THE TAX DEPARTMENT.

57
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:15,935
WE'LL GET THIS
STRAIGHTENED OUT.

58
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,470
WE'RE NOT PHONING ANYBODY.

59
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,972
I'M THINKIN' THAT
I MAY HAVE MADE COMMENTS

60
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:23,109
ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT,
TAX DEPARTMENT, OVER THE PAST--

61
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,610
COMMENTS?! THEY WERE THREATS.

62
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:25,912
I HEARD THEM -- THREATS.

63
00:02:25,978 --> 00:02:27,246
BUT I'LL TELL YA,

64
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,249
WHEN YOU TAKE A MAN
WHO'S BARELY MAKIN' ENDS MEET,

65
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,585
THEREFORE NOT ABLE
TO GENERATE ENOUGH INCOME

66
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,253
TO PAY THE INCOME TAX,

67
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,823
WHICH IS A PRIVILEGE --
THAT'S A PRIVILEGE.

68
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:39,926
WE'RE ONE OF THE WORLD'S
MOST PRIVILEGED COUNTRIES.

69
00:02:39,992 --> 00:02:42,528
AND YOU HAND THAT MAN $1,143...

70
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:45,865
I'M TELLING YA,
THIS IS A GREAT GOVERNMENT!

71
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,433
IT'S A GOOD DEAL!

72
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,736
(Red): LATER ON, WE'LL
BE MAKING A BIT OF WINE

73
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,605
ON "ADVENTURES WITH BILL".

74
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,874
I HAD DRIVEN OVER
TO THE VINEYARD

75
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,375
IN THE POSSUM VAN...

76
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,044
THAT WOULD BE ME ARRIVING.

77
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,614
UH, LOOK AT THAT BEAUTIFUL
VINEYARD OUT THE BACK, THERE.

78
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,616
LOOKS LIKE A BEAUTIFUL
BACKDROP.

79
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,885
BILL IS LOOKIN'
FOR THE WHEELBARROW.

80
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,853
GONNA PUT THE GRAPES IN THERE.

81
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,389
HE'S GONNA START
BY CRUSHING HIS MELON.

82
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:11,891
OHHH!

83
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,225
OH, BOY.

84
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:14,760
THAT WOULD, UH... YEAH.

85
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,262
NO HARM, NO FOUL, HUH?

86
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,298
ALL RIGHT, SO AROUND WE GO,
BECAUSE APPARENTLY

87
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,133
THE WHEELBARROW HAD WEDGED IN.

88
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,636
WE HAVE THE HEAVY-DUTY
SUSPENSION ON THAT,

89
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,905
WHICH WAS BUILT
TO CATCH WHEELBARROWS.

90
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:29,141
SHE'S LOOKIN', UH,
A LITTLE ROUGH, BILL.

91
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:33,512
AND I'M SUSPECTING THIS UNIT
IS OFF WARRANTY -- OOP!

92
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:35,681
I'LL TAKE OUT A ROLL
OF DUCT TAPE.

93
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,650
IT'S NOT QUITE AS GOOD AS NEW.

94
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,986
HARD TO BELIEVE ONE WHEEL
COULD BE OUT OF ALIGNMENT.

95
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:42,788
WE SEEM TO HAVE MANAGED IT.

96
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:45,024
BILL'S APPARENTLY SPOTTED
SOME GRAPES.

97
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:48,394
THESE ARE THE, UH, I BELIEVE,
THE CONCORD... MALLARD...

98
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:51,063
THEY'RE RIPE... WE DON'T KNOW
THEY'RE RIPE.

99
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,866
BILL'S GONNA...
PUT THIS GRAPE IN YOUR MOUTH.

100
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,201
BILL?

101
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:57,670
OH, GOSH -- I'LL TRY ONE.

102
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,004
BILL NEEDS A HAT.

103
00:03:59,071 --> 00:04:00,339
WHAT'S THIS? OH!

104
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,408
KIND OF THE BULK APPROACH.

105
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:03,776
AND HE'S ALL SET.

106
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,078
THROW IT IN THE WHEELBARROW.

107
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,880
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

108
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,749
OH, NOW, LOOKING
IN THE CAMPFIRE

109
00:04:10,816 --> 00:04:12,351
TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE

110
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,386
A PILE OF LOGS
AND KINDLING

111
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:16,956
THE ARTIST
FORMERLY KNOWN AS "TREE"

112
00:04:17,022 --> 00:04:20,493
OR DO YOU SEE THE SPIRIT
CALLING YOU LIKE A BROTHER

113
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:23,295
IF THAT SPIRIT LOOKS
LIKE AN AEROSOL CAN

114
00:04:23,362 --> 00:04:25,397
I SUGGEST
YOU RUN FOR COVER

115
00:04:25,464 --> 00:04:26,732
(Laughing)

116
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,968
WELCOME TO THE POSSUM LODGE
WORD GAME!

117
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:30,970
TONIGHT'S PRIZE IS
A YEAR'S SUPPLY

118
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:34,406
OF UNMARKED PHARMACEUTICALS
FROM THE CRANKHOUSE PHARMACY.

119
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:37,009
UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS

120
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:40,913
TO GET MR. MIKE HAMAR
TO SAY THIS WORD.

121
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,414
"ADDRESS".

122
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:43,916
(Quietly): "ADDRESS".

123
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:46,852
GO!

124
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,287
(Audience laughing)

125
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:51,957
ALL RIGHT, MIKE,
THE PLACE YOU CALL HOME.

126
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:53,959
THE BIG HOUSE.

127
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:56,195
WHERE YOU LIVE.

128
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:57,730
IN MY CAR.

129
00:04:57,796 --> 00:05:01,000
OK, YOU GOTTA PARK YOUR CAR
SOMEWHERE.

130
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:02,668
THE PLACE YOU
PARK IT IS...

131
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,069
... THE LIQUOR STORE.

132
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:05,571
(Audience laughing)

133
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,040
OK, LET ME TRY ANOTHER WAY.

134
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:10,476
WHEN YOU WRITE TO YOUR MOTHER,

135
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:12,878
YOU WRITE
TO HER...
... CASE WORKER.

136
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,280
(Audience laughing)

137
00:05:14,346 --> 00:05:16,782
I'M TALKIN'
ABOUT HER HOUSE, MIKE.

138
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,283
PICTURE THE FRONT DOOR.

139
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,185
THIS IS BESIDE IT OR ABOVE IT

140
00:05:20,252 --> 00:05:21,854
AND IT'S
CALLED...

141
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,622
... UH, THE RED LIGHT.

142
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:25,357
(Audience laughing)

143
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:28,193
NO, NO, MIKE, THIS IS A NUMBER.

144
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,229
OH, 666.

145
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:32,231
OK, AND THAT'S CALLED...

146
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:33,766
... GRAFFITI.

147
00:05:33,832 --> 00:05:35,701
I DID IT MYSELF.

148
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,202
IT'S FOR
MOTHER'S DAY.

149
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:38,537
REMEMBER THAT TIME

150
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:41,106
THEY MENTIONED YOUR NAME
ON THE RADIO?

151
00:05:41,173 --> 00:05:42,975
ON THE NEWS, EH?

152
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:45,677
THEY SAID THE COPS
HAVE ARRESTED MIKE HAMAR OF...

153
00:05:45,744 --> 00:05:47,179
... NO FIXED ADDRESS.

154
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:49,148
THERE WE...

155
00:05:49,214 --> 00:05:51,917
(Applause and cheering)

156
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:54,186
SCIENCE HAS PUT A MAN
ON THE MOON,

157
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,988
CURED A BUNCH OF DISEASES,

158
00:05:56,054 --> 00:05:58,991
AND EVEN DEFINED
THE ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE,

159
00:05:59,057 --> 00:06:03,028
BUT AS YET, THEY HAVE FAILED
TO SOLVE THE ULTIMATE MYSTERY:

160
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:05,798
HOW TO MAKE A HALF-DECENT
AMPHIBIOUS CAR.

161
00:06:05,864 --> 00:06:09,601
TODAY ON "HANDYMAN CORNER",
I'M GONNA SOLVE THE QUESTION

162
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:11,837
THAT HAS PLAGUED MANKIND
SINCE...

163
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,939
WELL, THE LATE '50's, I GUESS.

164
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,842
ANYBODY WHO'S MADE
AN AMPHIBIOUS CAR HAS FAILED

165
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,777
BECAUSE THEY STARTED
WITH A CAR

166
00:06:18,844 --> 00:06:20,746
AND TRIED TO MAKE IT SEAWORTHY.

167
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:23,282
I'LL START WITH A BOAT
AND MAKE IT ROADWORTHY.

168
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:24,616
I GOT THIS BOAT.

169
00:06:24,683 --> 00:06:27,052
SHE ALREADY FLOATS,
GOT A MOTOR ON 'ER.

170
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:29,555
ALL I NEED TO MAKE IT
INTO A CAR IS WHEELS.

171
00:06:29,621 --> 00:06:30,889
BUT WAIT A MINUTE!

172
00:06:30,956 --> 00:06:33,358
THIS BOAT ALREADY HAS
A SET OF WHEELS...

173
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:34,693
ON THE TRAILER!

174
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,995
ALL I GOTTA DO IS
HOOK UP THE MOTOR

175
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:38,897
SO IT WILL DRIVE THE WHEELS.

176
00:06:38,964 --> 00:06:40,799
SOUNDS HARD, RIGHT?

177
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:42,901
(Grunting)

178
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:45,771
WRONG! ALL YOU NEED IS
ONE MORE OUTBOARD MOTOR,

179
00:06:45,837 --> 00:06:47,639
SO YOU GOT ONE FOR EACH SIDE.

180
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:48,974
ALL YOU DO IS

181
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,475
REMOVE THE PROPELLER.

182
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:52,177
THERE'S A COTTER-PIN ON HERE.

183
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:53,545
OH, NO, NO.

184
00:06:53,612 --> 00:06:57,215
YOU GOTTA REMEMBER, OUTBOARD
MOTORS ARE WATER-COOLED.

185
00:06:57,282 --> 00:07:00,919
WE'RE GONNA COMPENSATE FOR THAT
BY GOIN' REALLY FAST.

186
00:07:00,986 --> 00:07:03,288
ALLS YOU GOTTA DO IS
RE-MOUNT THIS

187
00:07:03,355 --> 00:07:06,358
SO THAT THIS SHAFT RUBS UP
AGAINST THE TIRE,

188
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,794
AND LET FRICTION DO THE REST.

189
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,864
(Grunting)

190
00:07:12,931 --> 00:07:15,534
THERE WE GO --
DROP 'ER INTO GEAR.

191
00:07:17,936 --> 00:07:20,672
I'M THINKIN' BELT DRIVE.

192
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:24,576
(Grunting)

193
00:07:24,643 --> 00:07:26,011
FOR MAKIN' THE BELT,

194
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:29,381
I SUGGEST SOMETHING STRONG,
FLEXIBLE, AND WATERPROOF...

195
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:32,417
THE HANDYMAN'S
SECRET WEAPON, DUCT TAPE.

196
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:34,619
ALL RIGHT, JUST LAY THAT
IN THERE.

197
00:07:34,686 --> 00:07:36,621
THAT WOULDN'T BE ANY MORE SNUG

198
00:07:36,688 --> 00:07:39,324
IF I'D ACTUALLY TAKEN TIME
TO MEASURE IT.

199
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:42,327
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GIVE 'ER A TRY.

200
00:07:42,394 --> 00:07:43,829
(Grunting)

201
00:07:43,895 --> 00:07:47,566
JUST... START UP THE MOTOR.

202
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:52,571
I DID THAT TO SHOW YOU
WHAT HAPPENS

203
00:07:52,637 --> 00:07:55,974
IF YOU DON'T CUT A GROOVE
IN THE TIRE FOR THE BELT.

204
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,110
YOU WEREN'T THINKIN', WERE YOU?

205
00:07:58,176 --> 00:07:59,611
(Grunting)

206
00:07:59,678 --> 00:08:03,482
YOU WANT TO BE CAREFUL, 'CAUSE
RUBBER DOESN'T GROW ON TREES.

207
00:08:03,548 --> 00:08:05,183
ALL RIGHT, YEAH, IT DOES,

208
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,919
BUT BE CAREFUL IS WHAT I'M--
BE CAREFUL.

209
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,425
OHH...

210
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:18,430
AHHH...

211
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:22,601
ALL RIGHT, THERE'S OUR GROOVE.

212
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:24,135
WE GOT OUR BELT IN IT.

213
00:08:24,202 --> 00:08:27,172
THEY SAY NECESSITY'S
THE MOTHER OF INVENTION.

214
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:28,874
DON'T KNOW WHO THE FATHER IS.

215
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,375
PROBABLY REMORSE.

216
00:08:30,442 --> 00:08:32,878
I'VE DONE THE SAME THING
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

217
00:08:32,944 --> 00:08:34,379
GOT ANOTHER MOTOR THERE.

218
00:08:34,446 --> 00:08:36,948
GOT THE GROOVE IN THE TIRE
AND THE BELT ON.

219
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:39,451
THE ORIGINAL OUTBOARD MOTOR'S
ON THE BACK.

220
00:08:39,517 --> 00:08:42,754
SHE'S GOT THE PROP AND THAT'S
HOW WE'LL DRIVE OUR BOAT.

221
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:45,924
WE STEER THE SAME WAY THEY
STEER BULLDOZERS AND TANKS,

222
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:48,126
BY SPEEDIN' UP ONE SIDE
OR THE OTHER.

223
00:08:48,193 --> 00:08:50,161
TO TURN LEFT,
SPEED UP THIS MOTOR.

224
00:08:50,228 --> 00:08:52,230
TO TURN RIGHT,
SPEED UP THIS MOTOR.

225
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:55,033
KEEP 'EM THE SAME SPEED,
YOU'RE GOIN' STRAIGHT.

226
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,470
THE BEAUTY OF THIS IS IF YOU
WANT TO MAKE A SHARP CORNER,

227
00:08:58,536 --> 00:09:00,372
JUST FIRE ONE
INTO REVERSE, HUH?

228
00:09:00,438 --> 00:09:02,240
HERE'S SOMETHING
TO THINK ABOUT.

229
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:04,643
THE BOAT FLOATS
BUT THE TRAILER DOESN'T.

230
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:06,611
YOU MUST ATTACH ONE
TO THE OTHER.

231
00:09:06,678 --> 00:09:10,081
SPEND A LITTLE EXTRA
AND MAKE 'ER SOLID.

232
00:09:10,148 --> 00:09:13,118
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

233
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:15,286
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

234
00:09:15,353 --> 00:09:17,355
LET'S GO DRIVIN'
OUR AMPHIBIOUS CAR!

235
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:18,923
(Motor backfiring)

236
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:22,861
(Grunting)

237
00:09:22,927 --> 00:09:25,030
CHOKE...

238
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:27,699
COME ON, BABY --
OH, BOY! OH, BOY!

239
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:31,536
I'M GONNA GET SEASICK
ON DRY LAND!

240
00:09:31,603 --> 00:09:35,473
STAY TUNED -- WHATEVER THIS IS,
WE GOT LOTS MORE OF IT.

241
00:09:40,445 --> 00:09:41,980
WANT TO TALK TO YOU GUYS

242
00:09:42,046 --> 00:09:44,916
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA
HAPPEN TO YOUR WIFE

243
00:09:44,983 --> 00:09:47,118
THAT WILL AFFECT YOU
TREMENDOUSLY --

244
00:09:47,185 --> 00:09:49,621
WHEN A WOMAN GETS INTO
THOSE MIDDLE YEARS

245
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:52,824
AND HAS THIS BIOLOGICAL URGE
TO HAVE ONE MORE CHILD.

246
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:54,159
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

247
00:09:54,225 --> 00:09:56,561
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
HER BABIES ARE GROWN

248
00:09:56,628 --> 00:09:59,264
OR MAYBE SHE SEES
A YOUNGER WOMAN EXPECTING,

249
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:02,400
OR MAYBE SHE REALIZES
THAT ONCE THE KIDS MOVE OUT,

250
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:03,735
SHE'LL ONLY HAVE YOU.

251
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:05,236
(Audience laughing)

252
00:10:05,303 --> 00:10:06,571
BUT BELIEVE ME,

253
00:10:06,638 --> 00:10:09,207
PARENTHOOD AT YOUR AGE
IS NOT A GOOD IDEA.

254
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:12,143
AS YOU'RE SLIPPING
INTO YOUR SECOND CHILDHOOD,

255
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:15,747
YOU DON'T NEED SOMEBODY WHO'S
JUST STARTIN' THEIR FIRST.

256
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:17,649
YOU DON'T WANT SOMEBODY ELSE

257
00:10:17,715 --> 00:10:20,752
WHO GOES TO THE BATHROOM
MORE OFTEN THAN
 YOU
 DO.

258
00:10:20,818 --> 00:10:22,420
SO HERE'S WHAT YOU DO.

259
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:24,422
BORROW A BABY FOR THE WEEKEND.

260
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:26,691
FIND SOME NEW PARENTS
AND BABYSIT.

261
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:28,393
GIVE THEM A LITTLE BREAK.

262
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:31,162
BY THE TIME YOU HIT
THE ONE A.M. FEEDING,

263
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:33,898
YOUR WIFE WILL BE HAVIN'
SECOND THOUGHTS.

264
00:10:33,965 --> 00:10:35,700
THEN THE 3 A.M. COLIC FIT,

265
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:38,503
SHE'LL BE ASKING YOU
TO PHONE THE PARENTS,

266
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:40,638
AND BY THE 4 A.M.
DIAPER CHANGE,

267
00:10:40,705 --> 00:10:42,941
SHE'LL BE PRAYIN'
FOR HOT FLASHES.

268
00:10:43,007 --> 00:10:45,143
JUST LET NATURE
TAKE ITS COURSE.

269
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:47,278
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

270
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:49,213
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

271
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,683
(Laughing and applause)

272
00:10:55,153 --> 00:10:57,755
YEAH, IT'S ALL HERE.

273
00:10:57,822 --> 00:11:01,225
YOU EVER SEE $1,143
IN ONE PLACE BEFORE, HAROLD?

274
00:11:01,292 --> 00:11:02,727
YUP.

275
00:11:02,794 --> 00:11:04,195
ON "BAYWATCH NIGHTS".

276
00:11:04,262 --> 00:11:07,632
LIKE, THEY HAD
THESE DRUG DEALERS.

277
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:09,133
NOT LIKE PHARMACISTS.

278
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,835
THESE WERE
WERE ILLEGAL DRUG DEALERS.

279
00:11:10,902 --> 00:11:14,372
THEY HAD THIS DRUG DEAL,
SO THEY HAD ALL THIS MONEY.

280
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:17,108
THEN THEY THOUGHT
"LET'S GO FOR A SWIM."

281
00:11:17,175 --> 00:11:21,312
LUCKILY, THEY HAD THEIR SPEEDOS
UNDER THE DRUG-DEALER CLOTHES.

282
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:23,014
SO THEY GO IN THE WATER.

283
00:11:23,081 --> 00:11:26,084
THEY LEFT THEIR MONEY
UP ON THE BEACH.

284
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,852
SOMEONE STOLE THE MONEY!

285
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,620
SO THEY'RE FREAKIN' OUT.

286
00:11:29,687 --> 00:11:33,624
THEY'RE BLAMING EVERYBODY,
PARTICULARLY THE LIFEGUARDS.

287
00:11:33,691 --> 00:11:37,195
WHO ELSE BUT
PAMELA LEE ANDERSON GETS BLAMED?

288
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:39,530
THEY WANTED TO FRISK HER!

289
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:41,632
YOU COULD TELL BY

290
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:43,634
THE BATHING SUIT SHE HAD ON --

291
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:47,104
SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY LUMPS
SHE WASN'T SUPPOSE TO HAVE.

292
00:11:47,171 --> 00:11:49,240
THE LUMPS SHE HAD
WERE WORTH MORE

293
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:51,709
THAN $1,100.

294
00:11:51,776 --> 00:11:53,711
WHY DO I ASK?

295
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:56,180
I GOT THE CHEQUE MADE OUT
IN CASH.

296
00:11:56,247 --> 00:11:59,717
THAT WAY IT'S UNTRACEABLE
AND COMPLETELY LIQUID.

297
00:11:59,784 --> 00:12:01,219
I MAY USE PART OF IT

298
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:04,222
TO BUY SOMETHING
THAT'S COMPLETELY LIQUID.

299
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:06,424
UNCLE RED, THIS IS DISHONEST.

300
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,292
YOU'RE AN HONEST PERSON.

301
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:10,928
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN HONEST
WITH ME.

302
00:12:10,995 --> 00:12:12,430
THIS ISN'T DISHONEST.

303
00:12:12,496 --> 00:12:16,033
THE GOVERNMENT SENT ME A CHEQUE
AND I CASHED IT.

304
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,535
END OF STORY.

305
00:12:17,602 --> 00:12:20,238
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO --
MIDDLE OF STORY.

306
00:12:20,304 --> 00:12:22,006
END OF HAPPY PART.

307
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:23,874
GOVERNMENT FINDS THEIR MISTAKE.

308
00:12:23,941 --> 00:12:26,477
GOVERNMENT NAILS UNCLE RED.

309
00:12:26,544 --> 00:12:27,912
ALL RIGHT, HAROLD,

310
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:30,548
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
IF YOU WERE ME?

311
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:32,550
I'D INFORM THEM
OF THEIR MISTAKE

312
00:12:32,617 --> 00:12:34,251
AND RETURN THE MONEY.

313
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:36,854
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE NOT ME.

314
00:12:38,756 --> 00:12:40,625
DITTO!

315
00:12:43,427 --> 00:12:46,764
(Siren)

316
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:52,203
9-1-1.

317
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:54,205
HOW CAN WE HELP YOU?

318
00:12:54,271 --> 00:12:57,708
(Growling)

319
00:12:57,775 --> 00:12:59,210
WHAT IS THAT?

320
00:12:59,276 --> 00:13:00,711
THAT'S A BEAR!

321
00:13:00,778 --> 00:13:02,713
THAT'S A RABID BEAR!

322
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,716
THAT'S A RABID BEAR IN HEAT!

323
00:13:05,783 --> 00:13:07,685
SOUNDS LIKE A WOLF
WITH A WEDGIE!

324
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:09,186
WHAT IS THAT?

325
00:13:09,253 --> 00:13:13,290
MAN, HAROLD, I'M GLAD I'M NOT
IN THE ROOM WITH THAT THING!

326
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:14,792
SOMEBODY'S IN THE ROOM!

327
00:13:14,859 --> 00:13:16,861
HOW ELSE DID THEY CALL?

328
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,864
OH, BOY --
HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

329
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,233
WE GOTTA CALM THE DOG DOWN.

330
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:23,734
TALK TO IT.

331
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:27,671
WHAT WOULD YOU NAME A DOG
THAT SOUNDS LIKE THAT?

332
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:29,173
KILLER, KILLER, KILLER.

333
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,674
(Snarling)

334
00:13:30,741 --> 00:13:32,176
TERMINATOR.

335
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:33,778
DEADLY FORCE.

336
00:13:33,844 --> 00:13:35,679
MURDE-- CLARK.

337
00:13:35,746 --> 00:13:38,682
FLUFFY --
FLUFFY, FLUFFY, FLUFFY, FLUFFY!

338
00:13:38,749 --> 00:13:40,184
FLUFFY?

339
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:41,685
IT COULD BE.

340
00:13:41,752 --> 00:13:43,587
YOU DON'T KNOW THIS DOG.

341
00:13:43,654 --> 00:13:45,189
THIS SOUNDS SO FAMILIAR.

342
00:13:45,256 --> 00:13:47,291
I CAN PICTURE MYSELF
HEARING IT.

343
00:13:47,358 --> 00:13:49,193
I'M RUNNING DOWN THE STREET.

344
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,196
"CALL YOUR DOG, CALL YOUR DOG,
MR. WINSLOW!"

345
00:13:52,263 --> 00:13:54,365
IT'S THE WINSLOW DOG.

346
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:55,866
JASON, JASON!

347
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:57,368
(Panting)

348
00:13:57,434 --> 00:13:59,370
GOOD BOY, GOOD DOG.

349
00:13:59,436 --> 00:14:01,171
YOU CAN SAY THAT NOW.

350
00:14:01,238 --> 00:14:03,541
WAIT TILL HE'S CHASING YOU.

351
00:14:03,607 --> 00:14:07,545
MR. WINSLOW, MRS. WINSLOW,
ANYBODY THERE?

352
00:14:07,611 --> 00:14:09,046
HELLO?

353
00:14:09,113 --> 00:14:11,215
THANK-- THANK YOU, GUYS.

354
00:14:11,282 --> 00:14:15,219
THE DOG WAS STOPPING ME FROM
TAKING OUT THE TELEVISION SET.

355
00:14:15,286 --> 00:14:17,221
WELL, THAT'S OK, MR. WINSLOW.

356
00:14:17,288 --> 00:14:19,390
WHY WERE YOU TAKING OUT
THE T.V.?

357
00:14:19,456 --> 00:14:21,258
'CAUSE I'M NOT MR. WINSLOW.

358
00:14:21,325 --> 00:14:23,594
(Audience laughing)

359
00:14:23,661 --> 00:14:27,765
WELL, AS PROMISED, THIS WEEK
ON "ADVENTURES WITH BILL"

360
00:14:27,831 --> 00:14:29,433
WE'LL MAKE SOME WINE.

361
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,169
GOT THE WHEELBARROW FULL OF
GRAPES.

362
00:14:32,236 --> 00:14:34,171
BILL, BILL!

363
00:14:34,238 --> 00:14:36,006
MAN, HEAVY.

364
00:14:36,073 --> 00:14:37,741
BILL HAD GONE TO GET--

365
00:14:37,808 --> 00:14:39,677
OH, HE GOT A CARD TABLE.

366
00:14:39,743 --> 00:14:42,046
WATCH THAT.

367
00:14:42,112 --> 00:14:44,081
YEAH, THE LEGS FOLD UP--

368
00:14:44,148 --> 00:14:45,516
THAT ONE FOLDS UP

369
00:14:45,582 --> 00:14:48,018
THE SAME AS
THE FIRST ONE DID.

370
00:14:48,085 --> 00:14:49,520
OW!

371
00:14:49,586 --> 00:14:52,256
I'M BEGINNING TO THINK
HE ENJOYS THIS.

372
00:14:52,322 --> 00:14:54,191
I WOULD SAY DEFINITELY.

373
00:14:54,258 --> 00:14:56,427
ANYWAY, THAT'S ALL THE LEGS.

374
00:14:56,493 --> 00:14:58,262
SO, PUT HER DOWN THERE.

375
00:14:58,328 --> 00:15:00,264
KIND OF HEAVY HERE, BILL.

376
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,599
WE'RE SET TO SEE WHAT WE GOT.

377
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,501
BILL SAYS YOU GOTTA SEE

378
00:15:04,568 --> 00:15:07,771
HOW MUCH JUICE
YOU CAN GET OUT OF THEM.

379
00:15:09,773 --> 00:15:12,042
THAT'S ONE WAY OF TESTING.

380
00:15:12,109 --> 00:15:14,311
A LOT OF ACID IN THOSE GRAPES.

381
00:15:14,378 --> 00:15:16,547
THIS IS ANOTHER WAY OF, UH...

382
00:15:16,613 --> 00:15:17,748
OH, MAN!

383
00:15:17,815 --> 00:15:19,983
BILL!

384
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,019
THAT WAS A LITTLE BETTER.

385
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:26,089
BILL, THERE'S A MACHINE
THAT GOES WAY BACK IN TIME.

386
00:15:26,156 --> 00:15:27,791
AHA!

387
00:15:27,858 --> 00:15:30,160
THE WINE PRESS.

388
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:32,062
YOU DON'T NEED THAT.

389
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:34,131
OH.

390
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:36,200
I GUESS I DON'T NEED THAT.

391
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:39,169
WE PUT THE GRAPES
INTO THE WINE PRESS.

392
00:15:39,236 --> 00:15:42,172
DUMP 'EM IN,
DUMP 'EM IN, DUMP 'EM IN.

393
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:43,674
THERE YOU GO.

394
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,176
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED YOU TO DO.

395
00:15:46,243 --> 00:15:47,678
OW!

396
00:15:47,744 --> 00:15:51,415
NOW HE PUTS THAT PLATE ON
TO PRESS THEM DOWN.

397
00:15:51,481 --> 00:15:53,717
THEN HE PUTS THE HANDLE ON.

398
00:15:53,784 --> 00:15:55,219
THIS IS A TRADITION.

399
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:57,120
THE WAY OF SQUEEZING GRAPES

400
00:15:57,187 --> 00:16:00,123
GOES BACK TO THE DAYS
OF SOCRATES PROBABLY.

401
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,859
I BELIEVE HE DRANK
HIS SHARE OF WINE.

402
00:16:02,926 --> 00:16:04,361
HE MUST HAVE.

403
00:16:04,428 --> 00:16:05,862
HAVE YOU READ HIS STUFF?

404
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:08,231
BILL'S FINDING THAT
THIS IS TEDIOUS.

405
00:16:08,298 --> 00:16:11,435
SO HE'S GOT AN IDEA
OF HOW TO SPEED THE PROCESS.

406
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:15,806
THIS TECHNIQUE DATES BACK TO
THE DAYS OF HENRY FORD.

407
00:16:15,872 --> 00:16:18,275
HE'S HOOKED UP
A PULLEY SYSTEM

408
00:16:18,342 --> 00:16:21,044
FROM THE WHEEL
OF THE POSSUM VAN.

409
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:23,780
HE'S GOT ANOTHER HUB ON THERE.

410
00:16:23,847 --> 00:16:27,751
JUST BY STARTING HER UP
AND GOING IN VARIOUS GEARS,

411
00:16:27,818 --> 00:16:30,053
WE CAN RAISE OR LOWER, UH...

412
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,056
WE CAN RAISE OR LOWER
THE, UH, THE UH...

413
00:16:33,123 --> 00:16:34,658
WELL, YOU KNOW.

414
00:16:34,725 --> 00:16:36,326
WE PUT IT IN REVERSE.

415
00:16:36,393 --> 00:16:38,028
THAT SPINS THAT.

416
00:16:38,095 --> 00:16:41,665
AND THEN WHAT THAT WOULD DO
IS LOWER THE PLATE,

417
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:44,167
AND THAT WOULD
CRUSH THE GRAPES.

418
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:46,670
NOW WE CAN STOP HER.

419
00:16:46,737 --> 00:16:48,271
THAT STOPS HER.

420
00:16:48,338 --> 00:16:50,574
WE PUT HER INTO DRIVE.

421
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,075
THIS REVERSES EVERYTHING.

422
00:16:52,142 --> 00:16:55,212
THAT WOULD RAISE THE PLATE.

423
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:58,615
I WAS SO ENTHUSED THAT --
WE SHOULD HAVE WORKED OUT

424
00:16:58,682 --> 00:17:01,585
OUR HAND SIGNALS
'CAUSE I THOUGHT THAT MEANT

425
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:04,354
PUT HER INTO REVERSE.

426
00:17:04,421 --> 00:17:06,022
THIS IS UNFORTUNATE.

427
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:07,457
DON'T WATCH THIS.

428
00:17:07,524 --> 00:17:10,026
BUT,
WE GOT OURSELVES SOME WINE.

429
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:13,663
MAYBE NOT AS CLEAR AS
WHAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN,

430
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,566
BUT WE MADE UP FOR THAT
IN QUANTITY.

431
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:18,068
AND BILL IS

432
00:17:18,135 --> 00:17:22,439
REALLY NOT FEELING THAT GREAT
RIGHT NOW.

433
00:17:22,506 --> 00:17:24,641
BUT A GOOD ATTITUDE.

434
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,143
HE DIDN'T COMPLAIN.

435
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:28,979
HE JUST LET OUT A LITTLE WHINE.

436
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,716
HERE'S TO YOU, BILL.

437
00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:37,287
HERE'S SOMETHING SENT
BY A VIEWER.

438
00:17:37,354 --> 00:17:40,724
IT'S THE POSSUM LODGE OATH
IN OLD ENGLISH.

439
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:46,329
THIS WILL MAKE YOU HAPPY.

440
00:17:46,396 --> 00:17:48,365
I'M GONNA GIVE MY REFUND BACK

441
00:17:48,431 --> 00:17:51,868
BY DIVIDING IT AMONG
THE 20 GUYS THAT HAVE BEEN TO

442
00:17:51,935 --> 00:17:54,738
THE MOST MEETINGS
IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

443
00:17:54,804 --> 00:17:56,306
EACH GUY GETS $57.

444
00:17:56,373 --> 00:17:58,808
YOU CALL THAT
GIVING THAT BACK?

445
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,577
THESE GUYS AREN'T SAVERS.

446
00:18:00,644 --> 00:18:02,979
THE MONEY WILL
BE INTO THE ECONOMY

447
00:18:03,046 --> 00:18:04,347
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

448
00:18:04,414 --> 00:18:08,251
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
TILL THE GOVERNMENT GETS IT.

449
00:18:08,318 --> 00:18:11,054
ANYWAY, I WON'T BE
THE ONLY ONE GOING TO JAIL.

450
00:18:11,121 --> 00:18:14,724
THERE WILL BE 20 OTHER GUYS
THAT I KNOW THERE.

451
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,960
I'M SURE THERE ALREADY ARE.

452
00:18:17,027 --> 00:18:20,130
TELL THE TAX DEPARTMENT
THEY MADE A MISTAKE.

453
00:18:20,196 --> 00:18:22,465
DON'T GIVE THEM YOUR NAME.

454
00:18:22,532 --> 00:18:24,467
THEY'LL TRACK ME DOWN.

455
00:18:24,534 --> 00:18:27,537
THEY'LL SAY SOMETHING
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO HEAR.

456
00:18:27,604 --> 00:18:30,407
THEN THEY'LL KILL ME
'CAUSE I KNOW TOO MUCH.

457
00:18:30,473 --> 00:18:33,543
UNCLE RED KNOWING TOO MUCH.

458
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,547
(Laughing)

459
00:18:37,614 --> 00:18:40,050
NOTHING.

460
00:18:40,116 --> 00:18:41,284
NOW WE FOCUS ON

461
00:18:41,351 --> 00:18:43,086
THE THREE LITTLE WORDS

462
00:18:43,153 --> 00:18:45,088
MEN FIND SO HARD TO SAY,

463
00:18:45,155 --> 00:18:47,824
(All): I DON'T KNOW!

464
00:18:47,891 --> 00:18:49,325
OK, EXCELLENT.

465
00:18:49,392 --> 00:18:52,729
TO JOIN MY UNCLE RED
IS THE PRESIDENT OF

466
00:18:52,796 --> 00:18:56,766
ROTHSCHILD SEPTIC AND
SEWAGE SUCKING SERVICES,

467
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,568
MR. WINSTON ROTHSCHILD!

468
00:18:58,635 --> 00:19:01,438
(Applause)

469
00:19:01,504 --> 00:19:05,575
THIS WEEK'S LETTER COMES FROM
A LADY IN CINCINNATI.

470
00:19:05,642 --> 00:19:09,245
"I'VE BEEN TRYING TO START
MY OWN CAR RENTAL BUSINESS,

471
00:19:09,312 --> 00:19:10,780
"IT'S BEEN A DISASTER.

472
00:19:10,847 --> 00:19:12,982
"I ONLY RENTED ONE CAR
LAST YEAR.

473
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:15,084
"THE GUY
NEVER BROUGHT IT BACK.

474
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:17,387
"SO TECHNICALLY,
THAT'S CAR THEFT.

475
00:19:17,453 --> 00:19:18,888
"WHAT CAN I DO?"

476
00:19:18,955 --> 00:19:21,791
SIGNED "THE NUMBER TWO
CAR RENTAL COMPANY.

477
00:19:21,858 --> 00:19:24,894
"WE'RE NOT NUMBER TWO,
BUT WE FEEL LIKE IT."

478
00:19:24,961 --> 00:19:26,396
(Laughing)

479
00:19:26,462 --> 00:19:28,665
YOUR PROBLEM IS
MARKET POSITION.

480
00:19:28,731 --> 00:19:31,534
YOU GOTTA BE FIRST
AND YOU GOTTA BE BEST.

481
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:33,670
IF YOU CAN'T BE BEST,
BE FIRST.

482
00:19:33,736 --> 00:19:37,173
IF YOU CAN'T BE FIRST,
IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO BE BEST.

483
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,509
IS THAT TRUE ALSO IN ROMANCE?

484
00:19:39,576 --> 00:19:42,111
THESE DAYS
IT'S HARD TO BE FIRST.

485
00:19:42,178 --> 00:19:44,614
(Laughing)

486
00:19:44,681 --> 00:19:48,418
HAROLD'S HAVING TROUBLE
JUST GETTING IN LINE.

487
00:19:48,484 --> 00:19:53,056
(Laughing)

488
00:19:53,122 --> 00:19:54,857
THIS LADY WASN'T THE FIRST

489
00:19:54,924 --> 00:19:57,293
TO GET INTO
THE CAR RENTAL BUSINESS.

490
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,296
SHE SHOULD HAVE PICKED
A DIFFERENT BUSINESS,

491
00:20:00,363 --> 00:20:02,465
SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE UNIQUE.

492
00:20:02,532 --> 00:20:04,467
I WOULD LEAN TOWARD SEWAGE.

493
00:20:04,534 --> 00:20:06,936
CINCINNATI IS A BIG CITY.

494
00:20:07,003 --> 00:20:10,540
MAYBE IT DOESN'T RUN ON
SEPTIC TANKS.

495
00:20:10,606 --> 00:20:13,343
THAT'S TOO BAD --
IT'S A GROWTH BUSINESS.

496
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:15,511
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

497
00:20:15,578 --> 00:20:20,083
IT'S THE LAST THING
PEOPLE STOP DOING.

498
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:21,951
(Laughing)

499
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,355
WELL,

500
00:20:25,421 --> 00:20:26,856
THAT'S ALL DONE.

501
00:20:26,923 --> 00:20:29,092
TWENTY GUYS SHARED
MY TAX REFUND.

502
00:20:29,158 --> 00:20:31,461
THE REACTION
WAS PRETTY CONSISTENT.

503
00:20:31,527 --> 00:20:34,197
BIG SMILE, THEN
THE CREEPING REALIZATION

504
00:20:34,263 --> 00:20:36,099
THAT THEY OWED ME BIG-TIME.

505
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:37,734
UNCLE RED,

506
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,936
I PHONED THE TAX DEPARTMENT.

507
00:20:40,002 --> 00:20:41,604
PARDON ME,
HAROLD.

508
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:43,272
IT'S GOOD NEWS.

509
00:20:43,339 --> 00:20:44,774
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS.

510
00:20:44,841 --> 00:20:46,175
THIS IS SO GOOD.

511
00:20:46,242 --> 00:20:47,677
THIS IS GREAT.

512
00:20:47,744 --> 00:20:49,178
OVER THE YEARS --

513
00:20:49,245 --> 00:20:51,848
THIS IS SO GOOD --
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

514
00:20:51,914 --> 00:20:54,584
OVER THE YEARS,
YOU'VE EXCEEDED THE LIMIT

515
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,319
TO YOUR MEDICAL EXPENSES.

516
00:20:56,385 --> 00:21:00,523
SO YOU'RE ENTITLED TO
A REBATE OF $1,143.

517
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,425
ISN'T THAT GREAT?!

518
00:21:02,492 --> 00:21:06,562
ARE YOU -- ARE YOU TELLING ME
MY TAX REFUND WAS OK, HAROLD?

519
00:21:06,629 --> 00:21:08,064
OH NO, NO, NO.

520
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,599
FINE.

521
00:21:09,665 --> 00:21:11,434
IT'S NOT A REFUND,
IT'S A REBATE.

522
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:14,103
THE MONEY WAS ALL YOURS --
IT'S ALL YOURS.

523
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,939
THE WAY THEY PHRASE THINGS
UP THERE, EH!

524
00:21:17,006 --> 00:21:18,774
WOO-OO!

525
00:21:18,841 --> 00:21:20,276
THOSE GUYS.

526
00:21:20,343 --> 00:21:22,144
(Laughing)

527
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:23,646
THOSE-- THOSE GUYS.

528
00:21:23,713 --> 00:21:28,384
HAROLD, YOU MADE ME GIVE
MY REFUND AWAY TO ALL THE GUYS.

529
00:21:28,451 --> 00:21:30,786
NO, NO,
NO, NO.
YES, YES.

530
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:32,288
NO, I DID NOT.

531
00:21:32,355 --> 00:21:35,057
I SUGGESTED THAT
WE PHONE THE GOVERNMENT

532
00:21:35,124 --> 00:21:36,792
AND STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT.

533
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:39,362
BUT YOU CHOSE TO
GIVE THE MONEY AWAY.

534
00:21:39,428 --> 00:21:42,164
I WOULD NEVER CHOOSE TO DO
SUCH A THING.

535
00:21:42,231 --> 00:21:44,900
PERSONALLY, I WOULD SAY
THAT'S STUPID.

536
00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:50,206
YOU KNOW HOW SOMETIMES
PEOPLE NEED TIME ALONE?

537
00:21:50,273 --> 00:21:54,110
YES, I UNDERSTAND,
YOU NEED SOME TIME ALONE.

538
00:21:54,176 --> 00:21:57,446
NO, YOU NEED TIME
AWAY FROM ME.

539
00:21:57,513 --> 00:21:59,115
IT'S IMPORTANT.

540
00:21:59,181 --> 00:22:00,616
NOW, HAROLD.

541
00:22:00,683 --> 00:22:02,118
OK, POINT TAKEN.

542
00:22:02,184 --> 00:22:05,054
I AM RECEIVING
WHAT YOU'RE SENDING OUT.

543
00:22:05,121 --> 00:22:06,555
(Squealing)

544
00:22:06,622 --> 00:22:09,558
I'LL MEET YOU AT THE MEETING.

545
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:12,128
YOU'LL BE IN YOUR ROOM,
I THINK.

546
00:22:12,194 --> 00:22:13,696
I'LL BE IN MY ROOM.

547
00:22:13,763 --> 00:22:15,431
THAT'S WHERE I'LL GO.

548
00:22:15,498 --> 00:22:18,768
IT'S BETTER FOR ME TO BE AWAY
IN MY ROOM.

549
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:20,302
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

550
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:23,406
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

551
00:22:23,472 --> 00:22:25,574
I'M NOT REALLY
GONNA HURT HAROLD,

552
00:22:25,641 --> 00:22:28,611
BUT, AS YOU SAY,
IT'S THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS.

553
00:22:28,677 --> 00:22:31,080
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

554
00:22:31,147 --> 00:22:34,583
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND HAROLD AND EVERYBODY AT--

555
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,519
(Squealing)

556
00:22:36,585 --> 00:22:38,854
KEEP YOUR... ON THE ICE.

557
00:22:38,921 --> 00:22:42,324
(Applause and cheering)

558
00:22:42,391 --> 00:22:47,096
(Possum squeal)

559
00:22:47,163 --> 00:22:50,599
TAKE YOUR SEATS, EVERYBODY!

560
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:52,101
I GOT NO HAROLD HERE.

561
00:22:52,168 --> 00:22:53,602
EVERYBODY STAND UP.

562
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:55,104
HAROLD'S NOT COMING.

563
00:22:55,171 --> 00:22:57,807
HERE WE GO.

564
00:22:57,873 --> 00:23:00,943
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

565
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,611
(Red): SIT DOWN, GUYS.

566
00:23:02,678 --> 00:23:04,046
YOU PROBABLY HEARD WE HAD

567
00:23:04,113 --> 00:23:06,215
A GAME OF SUNFISH BASEBALL.

568
00:23:06,282 --> 00:23:08,050
IT'S JUST LIKE BASEBALL

569
00:23:08,117 --> 00:23:10,085
EXCEPT YOU USE A SUNFISH.

570
00:23:10,152 --> 00:23:11,854
THEY NOW HAVE A RULING

571
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:14,290
ON THAT HIT BY MOOSE THOMPSON.

572
00:23:14,356 --> 00:23:16,225
IT'S A HOMER, A GROUNDER

573
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:17,593
AND A FOUL BALL.
