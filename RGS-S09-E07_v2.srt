00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:03,903
I’M LOOKING FOR A
BETTER WAY

00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:05,672
PUTTING WINDOW TINTING
ON MY VEHICLE

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,273
WHEN I GOT THINKING

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,210
SUNGLASSES ARE LIKE WINDOW
TINTING FOR HUMANS.

5
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:13,346
THEY MAKE YOU LOOK
INTIMIDATING, MYSTERIOUS,

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,914
OR JUST PLAIN COOL.

7
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:16,816
IF SUNGLASSES CAN
DO THAT FOR PEOPLE,

8
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:20,253
WHY CAN'T THEY ALSO
DO IT FOR MY TRUCK?

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,857
BECAUSE YOU GET THOSE HOMEMADE
DO-IT-YOURSELF WINDOW

00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:25,625
AND THEY NEVER GO ON EVEN.

11
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:29,529
AFTER A FEW WEEKS IT STARTS TO
LOOK LIKE LAWRENCE WELK NIGHT
AT THE SENIORS' HOME,

ALL BUBBLES AND WRINKLES.

00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:35,101
AND THEN AT NIGHT, THERE'S
NOT ENOUGH LIGHT TO SEE
WHERE YOU'RE GOIN'.

00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:39,606
YOU'RE IN CONTROL.

16

YOU JUST FLIP UP YOUR TINT
FOR MAXIMUM VISIBILITY.

00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,399
I GOT BIG NEWS.

23
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,735
WE HAD WHAT YOU CALL A
HORTICULTURAL BREAKTHROUGH

24
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:10,336
UP AT THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

25
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,073
I'VE GOT A PRODUCT THAT
I THINK EVERY HOMEOWNER
IS GONNA WANT TO BUY.

26
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,209
I'VE GOT A NEW KIND
OF GRASS SEED HERE.

27
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,444
SEE? HUH?

28
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,580
ACTUALLY IT WAS
CREATED BY ACCIDENT,

29
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:23,149
BUT WHO WASN'T?

30
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:26,286
YEAH, WHAT HAPPENED WAS I
KNOCKED OVER A SHELF
IN THE TOOL SHED

31
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,221
A LITTLE WHILE AGO,
AND SOME OF THE GRASS SEED

32
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,922
MIXED DOWN WITH SOME OF THE
PAINT AND THE CHEMICALS

33
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:31,424
AND SO ON
ON THE DIRT FLOOR.

34
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,026
I DIDN'T THINK
ANYTHING OF IT.

35
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:35,128
BUT SIX MONTHS LATER,
LOOK AT THIS.

36
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:39,799
THE GRASS GREW THIS HIGH,
AND THEN IT STOPPED GROWING.

IS THAT PERF --

38
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,769
I HAD A LOOK AT
THOSE LAWN MOWERS OF YOURS,

00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,404
AND THEY'RE
NOT WORTH MUCH.

40
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,939
YOU GOT THE THE MISMATCHED
WHEELS AND THE BROOM HANDLES.

41
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:48,941
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TROUBLE
SELLIN' THOSE, RED.

42

I'VE NEVER SEEN A WRENCH USED
AS A LAWN MOWER BLADE
BEFORE EITHER.

IF YOU HAVE TO SELL
THEM BY THE POUND.

'EM ANYMORE.

A RIDING MOWER?
NO, NO.

46
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,488
LOOK AT THIS, DALTON.
I GOT A NEW KIND
OF GRASS.

47
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:05,958
IMAGINE A LAWN THAT
ONLY GROWS THAT HIGH.

48

PUT ON THAT?

NOW, PERSONALLY, I COULD
LISTEN TO THAT KIND OF

00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:19,472
BUT LUCKILY THIS
ISN'T THE DAY,

54
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,441
SO I'M GONNA TAKE
THE GRASS SEED,

00:02:21,507 --> 00:02:24,110
I'M GONNA RE-SEED THE
WHOLE LODGE PROPERTY.

ONLY GROWS A COUPLE INCHES,

WE COULD BE SITTIN'
ON A GOLD MINE, YOU KNOW.

58
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,617
WE SHOULD PUT OUT
A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT.

59
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,720
YEAH, OKAY.
BUT LET'S WAIT TILL
WE SELL THE LAWN MOWERS.

I'M HERE TO GIVE YOU
SOME ADVICE

62
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,302
ON DOING YOUR FIREWORKS
DISPLAY THIS YEAR.

63
00:02:49,368 --> 00:02:52,738
NOW, MY SUGGESTION IS TO FORGET
ABOUT THE FIRECRACKERS,

64
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,707
AND BLOW UP SOME OLD
FURNITURE WITH DYNAMITE.

65
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:57,777
NOW, GIVEN THE CHOICE,

66
00:02:57,843 --> 00:03:00,146
WOULD YOU RATHER SEE SOME
PATHETIC LITTLE SPARKY LIGHT

67
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,415
SHOOTING UP THROUGH
THE AIR AND GOING POP --

68

VERY QUIETLY I MIGHT ADD --

OR CHUNKS OF DIRT AND WOOD
FLYING UP INTO THE AIR

00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,455
ACCOMPANIED BY A
THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION?

71
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,225
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

72
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:14,727

FOR THIS YEAR.

76
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,103
NOW, WHAT I'VE DONE,
FOR YOUR VIEWING PLEASURE,

77
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:29,108
IS I'VE NAMED EACH EXPLOSION,
JUST LIKE THE DIFFERENT
FIRECRACKERS

78
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:33,112
ARE NAMED ACCORDING TO THEIR
PARTICULAR PROPERTIES.

NOW, THIS ONE I CALL
THE EXPLODING DRESSER.

AND THIS ONE I CALL THE
EXPLODING COMPUTER TABLE.

81

AND THIS ONE,
THE EXPLODING BOOKSHELF.

82
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:48,294
UH, I HAVEN'T GOT
A NAME FOR THIS ONE YET,

83
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,196
BUT IT'S MY FAVOURITE.

84
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:51,997
AND JUST LIKE
THE REAL FIREWORKS,

BE RIGHT.

HE'S RELAXING.

MAYBE IF WE JUST GIVE HIM
A COUPLE MORE MINUTES.

TIME DO WE HAVE?

IS DECEASED.

DO EITHER OF YOU KNOW HOW WE
CAN FINALLY DESTROY THE SUN

304
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:54,031
ONCE AND FOR ALL?

305
00:13:54,098 --> 00:13:58,168
UH, I REALLY DON'T THINK
WE NEED TO DESTROY SUN,
RANGER GORD.

306
00:13:58,235 --> 00:13:59,803
I THINK --
THINK AGAIN.

307
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,572
SOME PEOPLE WOULD HAVE YOU
BELIEVE THAT THE SUN IS

308
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:04,475
SIMPLY A BIG HARMLESS BALL
BURNING WOOD AND DEAD LEAVES.

309
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:05,910
WELL, THEY'RE WRONG.

310
00:14:05,943 --> 00:14:09,146
THE SUN IS A LIVING BEING
SET ON DESTROYING MANKIND.

311
00:14:09,213 --> 00:14:11,916
SO WE MUST ABOLISH
THE SUN FROM THE SKY.

312
00:14:11,982 --> 00:14:14,051
HERE, TAKE THESE
RAY GUNS.

313
00:14:16,053 --> 00:14:17,454
WE'LL SHOW THAT SUN.

314
00:14:17,521 --> 00:14:20,424
WITH THESE RAY GUNS WE CAN
GIVE AS GOOD AS WE GET.

315
00:14:20,491 --> 00:14:23,093
UH, GORD, I DON'T
THINK WE NEED TO
BLAST THE SUN.

316
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,561
IT'S CRAZY.

317
00:14:24,628 --> 00:14:26,363
I'LL JUST PUT ON
SOME SUNBLOCK LOTION,

318
00:14:26,397 --> 00:14:27,931
AND I'LL BE FINE.

319
00:14:27,998 --> 00:14:30,334
WELL, THAT'S JUST
PEACHY, LITTLE RED.

320
00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:32,870
YOU CAN JUST SIT BACK
COVERED IN YOUR
FANCY LOTION

321
00:14:32,936 --> 00:14:34,605
AND PLAY DEFENCE FOR
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE,

322
00:14:34,672 --> 00:14:36,640
NEVER ONCE STANDING
UP TO THE SUN.

323
00:14:36,674 --> 00:14:39,310
MEANWHILE, LITTLE HAROLD
AND I WILL FIGHT THE SUN

324
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:40,844
TO THE DEATH
IF WE HAVE TO

325
00:14:40,911 --> 00:14:43,280
TO SAVE MANKIND.

326
00:14:43,347 --> 00:14:46,116
TO THE DEATH?

327
00:14:46,183 --> 00:14:48,118
YOU'RE NOT RIGHT
IN THE HEAD, GORD.

328
00:14:51,722 --> 00:14:54,625
OH, NO, THE SUN HAS BEEN
EAVESDROPPING ON US.

329
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:56,360
IT KNOWS WHAT
WE'RE UP TO.

330
00:14:56,427 --> 00:14:59,363
THERE'S NO TIME.
WE MUST DESTROY IT NOW!

331
00:15:05,869 --> 00:15:08,872
RANGER GORD, YOU FOOL,

332
00:15:08,906 --> 00:15:12,376
YOUR INCREDIBLE SUPERHUMAN
POWERS AND GOD-LIKE BODY

333
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:14,278
ARE NO MATCH FOR ME.

334
00:15:14,344 --> 00:15:17,214
AND YOUR PATHETIC LITTLE FRIENDS
CAN'T HELP YOU EITHER.

335
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,682
HA HA HA!

336
00:15:18,715 --> 00:15:21,852
HA HA HA HA.
JOKE'S ON YOU.

337
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:23,687
THEY WERE PATHETIC
AND LITTLE, YES,

338
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,423
BUT THEY WEREN'T
MY FRIENDS.

339
00:15:30,527 --> 00:15:31,728
COME ON, DROP IT.

340
00:15:31,795 --> 00:15:33,697
DROP YOUR GUN.

341
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,732
HEY, OW,
COME ON, STOP IT.

342
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:37,734
STOP IT, GORD.

343
00:15:37,801 --> 00:15:39,603
AW, PLEASE DON'T
DESTROY ME.

344
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:43,207
DO YOU PROMISE NOT TO SHOOT
DEATH RAYS AT PEOPLE ANYMORE?

345
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,709
YEAH.
SAY IT.

346
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:49,580
I PROMISE NOT TO
SHOOT DEATH RAYS
AT PEOPLE ANYMORE.

347
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:50,981
IT'S A DEAL.

348
00:15:51,048 --> 00:15:52,683
FOLKS, YOU HEARD THE SUN.

349
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:56,353
THANKS TO ME, WE NO LONGER
LIVE IN FEAR OF THE SUN'S
HARMFUL DEATH RAYS.

350
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,455
I SURE LEARNED MY LESSON.

351
00:15:58,522 --> 00:16:00,924
NOW EVERYONE CAN SPEND HOURS
AND HOURS IN THE SUN

352
00:16:00,991 --> 00:16:03,327
WITHOUT A CARE
IN THE WORLD.

353
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,331
WELL, EVERYONE BUT
THOSE TWO.

354
00:16:07,397 --> 00:16:08,899
HA HA HA.

355
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:12,035
HA HA HA HA!

[ APPLAUSE ]

357
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:24,281
HUH?

358
00:16:28,685 --> 00:16:31,021
AND AS YOU CAN SEE,
I HAVE A GUEST ON
THE SHOW TODAY.

359
00:16:31,054 --> 00:16:32,889
WELL, HE'S NOT
REALLY A GUEST.
IT'S JUST HAROLD.

360
00:16:32,956 --> 00:16:34,591
BUT I CAN
EXPLAIN THAT.

361
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:37,227
TODAY WE'RE
CELEBRATING CAREER DAY.

362
00:16:37,294 --> 00:16:40,364
SO NATURALLY WE NEEDED
SOMEBODY WITH A CAREER
ON THE SHOW,

363
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,766
BUT AROUND HERE,
THAT'S NOT SO
EASY TO FIND,

364
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,835
SO THAT'S WHERE
YOU COME IN, HAROLD.

365
00:16:44,868 --> 00:16:46,670
THANK YOU, MIKE.

366
00:16:46,737 --> 00:16:49,005
I DON'T REALLY KNOW IF IT'S
MUCH OF A CAREER YET, YOU KNOW.

367
00:16:49,072 --> 00:16:52,042
I'M STILL TRYING TO LEARN AND
GROW AND BE BETTER AT MY JOB

368
00:16:52,075 --> 00:16:55,645
AND REAP THE REWARDS THAT COME
WITH TAKING RESPONSIBILITY
FOR YOURSELF.

369
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:57,280
SEE, HE'S WEIRD
LIKE THAT.

370
00:16:57,347 --> 00:16:58,715
IT'S GREAT.

371
00:16:58,749 --> 00:17:02,018
SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A JOB AND
A CAREER?

372
00:17:02,052 --> 00:17:04,821
WELL, OKAY,
TO ME, PERSONALLY, UM,

373
00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:06,757
A JOB IS SOMETHING
THAT'S TEMPORARY.

374
00:17:06,823 --> 00:17:09,793
YOU KNOW, YOU STICK AT IT
FOR A LITTLE WHILE UNTIL
YOU QUIT OR GET FIRED.

375
00:17:09,826 --> 00:17:11,895
OR ESCAPE.

376
00:17:11,962 --> 00:17:14,197
OR ESCAPE, YES.

377
00:17:15,665 --> 00:17:17,734
YES, ALL RIGHT.
UM, BUT ON THE
OTHER HAND,

378
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:20,670
A CAREER IS SOMETHING THAT
YOU PLAN ON STICKING AT
FOR A LONG TIME,

379
00:17:20,704 --> 00:17:23,874
YOU KNOW, AND CLIMB UP THAT
LADDER UNTIL YOU RETIRE.

380
00:17:23,907 --> 00:17:26,610
SO A JOB IS LIKE
DRAWING ONE TO TWO,

381
00:17:26,676 --> 00:17:29,045
AND A CAREER IS BASICALLY
A LIFE SENTENCE?

382
00:17:31,648 --> 00:17:33,917
SIMILAR.

383
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:36,052
SO TELL ME ABOUT
YOUR JOB, HAROLD.

384
00:17:36,086 --> 00:17:38,588
UM, WHAT DID YOUR
LAWYER GET YOU?

385
00:17:38,655 --> 00:17:43,593
WELL, I'M AN ASSISTANT ACCOUNT
EXECUTIVE AT MULTI-CORP
INTERNATIONAL INC.

386
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,362
AND WHAT
DO THEY DO?

387
00:17:49,466 --> 00:17:52,135
WELL, UH, MIKE --

388
00:17:52,202 --> 00:17:55,038
THEY'RE VERY BIG.
THEY'RE HUGE.

389
00:17:55,105 --> 00:17:56,740
THEY'RE HUGE, MIKE.

390
00:17:56,806 --> 00:17:58,742
GOOD ENOUGH.
AND WHAT DO
YOU DO IN IT?

391
00:17:58,775 --> 00:18:00,911
I WORK WITH FILES.

392
00:18:00,977 --> 00:18:04,047
AND A FILING CABINET.

393
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:06,216
I DIDN'T BRING ONE ALONG TODAY
FOR SHOW AND TELL OR NOTHING

394
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:07,751
BECAUSE ONE GUY TRIED
THAT ONE TIME,

395
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:09,719
AND HE GOT FIRED.

396
00:18:11,087 --> 00:18:12,956
IT'S DOG EAT DOG
OUT THERE.

397
00:18:13,023 --> 00:18:14,891
YEAH, NO,
YOU'RE RIGHT, IT IS.

398
00:18:14,924 --> 00:18:18,128
BECAUSE, LIKE, WHEN I DO
HAVE WORK TO TAKE HOME ON THE
WEEKEND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

399
00:18:18,161 --> 00:18:19,896
I'VE LIKE A MINI
FILING CABINET.

400
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:23,466
IT'S CALLED AN
ATTACHE CASE.

401
00:18:23,767 --> 00:18:25,468
AND MY BOSS, IF HE EVER WANTS
TO GET IN TOUCH WITH ME,

402
00:18:25,535 --> 00:18:27,604
THEY GAVE ME
A CELLULAR PHONE.

403
00:18:27,637 --> 00:18:29,305
SO YOU --

404
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:31,307
SO YOU WORK
ALL ALONE

405
00:18:31,374 --> 00:18:33,643
ALL DAY IN A
WINDOWLESS CUBICLE,

406
00:18:33,677 --> 00:18:35,879
AND THEN YOU TAKE MORE WORK
HOME WITH YOU AT NIGHT,

407
00:18:35,912 --> 00:18:37,847
AND THEN IF YOUR BOSS
HAS ANY OTHER IDEAS,

408
00:18:37,914 --> 00:18:40,183
HE CAN CALL YOU UP
WHENEVER HE WANTS?

409
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,585
YEAH, THAT'S MY JOB.

410
00:18:42,652 --> 00:18:45,388
AND YOU'RE LOOKING
AT DOING THIS FOR LIFE?

NO.

WELL, I HAVE LEARNED
SO MUCH TODAY.

414
00:18:56,466 --> 00:18:58,501
I USED TO THINK A
JOB WAS PRETTY BAD,

415
00:18:58,568 --> 00:19:02,272
BUT A CAREER REALLY
SUCKS, DOESN'T IT?

416
00:19:02,605 --> 00:19:04,174
THANKS FOR COMING
ON THE SHOW, HAROLD.

417
00:19:04,207 --> 00:19:06,743

THE IDEA OF THE
WHOLE CONCEPT.

TURNS EVERYTHING GREEN.

GONNA DO?

THIS GRASS DOESN'T
GROW IN WATER,

IT DISSOLVES
IN WATER!

IT'S HEADING RIGHT
INTO THE LAKE.
