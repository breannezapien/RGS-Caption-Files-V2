00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,098
A VIDEO GAME.

56
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:13,900
>>RED: I DON'T KNOW HAROLD

59
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,970
THE LOCH POSSUM MONSTER SHOULD

60
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,639
BE NAMED PESSIE.

61
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,673
WE THOUGHT ABOUT CALLING IT

62
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:22,341
POSSIE BUT THAT KIND OF IMPLIED

63
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:25,077
THERE WAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM

00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:48,961
'HANDYMAN CORNER' WE'RE GOING

102
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:50,463

103
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:51,397
DO WITH SOME OF THOSE BEER

104
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,365
BOTTLES YOU GOT LYING AROUND

105
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,399
THE GARAGE OR DOWN IN THE

106
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,300
BASEMENT OR WHATEVER

107
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,434
I FOUND THESE BOTTLES IN

108
00:03:55,434 --> 00:03:57,269
THE CUSHIONS OF THE COUCH.

109
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:59,071
NOW ORDINARILY I WOULD JUST

110
00:03:59,071 --> 00:04:01,674
THROW THESE OUT OR TAKE THEM

111
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,442
BACK FOR A REFUND BUT I'M GOING

112
00:04:03,442 --> 00:04:04,677
TO SHOW YOU HOW YOU CAN

113
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:05,644
MAKE YOURSELF A DARNED

114
00:04:05,644 --> 00:04:07,913
INTERESTING CLOCK.

115
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:09,348
NOW THE FIRST THING YOU'RE

116
00:04:09,348 --> 00:04:10,416
GOING TO NEED IS SOMETHING

117
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,650
BIG AND FLAT TO HOLD ALL

118
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,286
THE MECHANISM FOR THE CLOCK

119
00:04:14,286 --> 00:04:16,922
EXCUSE ME A MINUTE.

120
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:28,000
(GRUNTING AND CRASHING)

121
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,768
I SUGGEST A FRIDGE DOOR

122
00:04:29,768 --> 00:04:30,636
FOR THE TIMELESS LOOK

123
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:32,738
OF WHITE ENAMEL.

124
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:34,173
AND YOU'RE ALSO GOING

125
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,474
TO NEED AN ELECTRIC MOTOR

126
00:04:35,474 --> 00:04:36,842
LIKE THIS ONE TO FEED THE

127
00:04:36,842 --> 00:04:38,244
BOTTLES INTO THE CLOCK

128
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:39,578
AND YOU'RE GOING TO NEED

129
00:04:39,578 --> 00:04:40,946
A WORK GLOVE JUST ONE THAT'S

130
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:42,214
GOING TO HELP FEED THE BOTTLES

131
00:04:42,214 --> 00:04:43,182
AS WELL SO YOU JUST NEED ONE

132
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,183
YOU CAN SELL THE OTHER ONE

133
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:45,384
TO THE NEIGHBOUR'S KID AND HE

134
00:04:45,384 --> 00:04:47,186
CAN GO OUT AND BE A ROCK STAR.

135
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,487
NOW YOU GOT TO SOAK THIS THING

136
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:49,955
IN A SOLUTION MADE UP OF MERCURY

137
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:52,057
LACQUER, RUBBING ALCOHOL,

138
00:04:52,057 --> 00:04:55,127
GASOLINE AND PAINT STRIPPER

139
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:56,195
OR AS WE CALL IT,

140
00:04:56,195 --> 00:05:01,100
POSSUM LAKE.

141
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,335
THERE WE GO, ONCE SHE'S DRY

142
00:05:03,335 --> 00:05:05,004
SHE'S HARD AS A BRICK

143
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,438
AND YOU STICK THE GLOVE ONTO

144
00:05:06,438 --> 00:05:09,908
A 1 BY 3 OR 2 BY 2 OR WHATEVER

145
00:05:09,908 --> 00:05:11,310
SIZE PIECE OF WOOD YOU FIND

146
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,378
WHEN YOU'RE OVER AT YOUR

147
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:13,412
NEIGHBOUR'S GARAGE SELLING

148
00:05:13,412 --> 00:05:15,347
HIS KID THE OTHER GLOVE.

149
00:05:15,347 --> 00:05:16,081
YOU KNOW THAT WOULD MAKE

150
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:18,450
A DANDY LITTLE

151
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,720
BACKSCRATCHER OR LOWER.

152
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,554
YOU KNOW A PANHANDLER

153
00:05:22,554 --> 00:05:23,922
COULD USE THIS COULD WORK

154
00:05:23,922 --> 00:05:25,591
BOTH SIDES OF THE MALL

155
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:26,558
AT THE SAME TIME.

156
00:05:26,558 --> 00:05:27,626
BUT WE'RE GOING TO USE IT

157
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:28,560
TO PICK UP THE BEER BOTTLES

158
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,762
AND THEN ROLL THEM INTO

159
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:30,996
THE FRIDGE DOOR.

160
00:05:30,996 --> 00:05:32,531
SO WHAT WE GOT TO DO NOW

161
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:33,666
IS TO CONNECT THIS TO OUR

162
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,100
ELECTRIC MOTOR JUST STICK IT

163
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,235
ON THERE AND YOU'LL HAVE

164
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,803
A LITTLE HOLE IN THERE

165
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:40,105
AND YOU CAN JUST DROP A NAIL

166
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:42,708
THROUGH AND THEN BEND HER OVER

167
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:43,776
OR I GUESS YOU COULD

168
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:44,743
USE A CAUDER PIN

169
00:05:44,743 --> 00:05:46,145
IF YOU'RE MADE OF MONEY.

170
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,146
AND THEN WHAT YOU DO IS

171
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,380
LINE HER UP SO IT'S GOING TO

172
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,116
GO RIGHT INTO THE FRIDGE DOOR

173
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:51,984
AND I THINK WE'RE LOOKING

174
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:52,985
PRETTY GOOD.

175
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:53,852
WHY DON'T WE PUT A BEER BOTTLE

176
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:58,424
IN THE GLOVE AND GIVE HER A TRY

177
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:00,692
THERE WE GO.

178
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:01,593
NOW SOON AS I PLUG THE MOTOR

179
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:02,795
IN THAT SHOULD JUST LAY THAT

180
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:03,662
BOTTLE IN THERE AS NICE

181
00:06:03,662 --> 00:06:09,501
AS YOU PLEASE.

182
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:12,204
(BOTTLE SMASHING)

183
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:13,672
>>RED: YEAH OKAY THAT WORKS,

184
00:06:13,672 --> 00:06:16,508
THAT WORKS EXCELLENT.

185
00:06:16,508 --> 00:06:17,409
IT'S JUST MAYBE JUST A TAD

186
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:18,577
FAST SO WE'LL SLOW THE

187
00:06:18,577 --> 00:06:19,978
ELECTRIC MOTOR DOWN

188
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:20,846
IT'S EASY TO DO YOU JUST

189
00:06:20,846 --> 00:06:22,247
OPEN THEM UP AND YOU CAN JUST

190
00:06:22,247 --> 00:06:23,582
START CUTTING WINDINGS UNTIL

191
00:06:23,582 --> 00:06:28,153
YOUR WRIST GETS TIRED OR YEAH

192
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:29,321
WHY DON'T WE JUST HOOK HER UP

193
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:30,589
TO ONE OF THESE HOUSEHOLD

194
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:34,493
DIMMERS, PERFECT.

195
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:36,895
ALL RIGHT NOW YOU MAY HAVE

196
00:06:36,895 --> 00:06:37,896
TO JIMMY AROUND WITH THE DIMMER

197
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:38,997
TO GET THE MOTOR DOWN TO EXACTLY

198
00:06:38,997 --> 00:06:45,037
ONE REVOLUTION PER MINUTE

199
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,838
GREENWICH TIME A.M. BUT ONCE

200

YOU DO BY GOLLY YOU'RE ALL

201
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,810
SET UP AND HERE'S HOW SHE WORKS.

202
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,011
THE GLOVE NOW IS GOING TO PICK

203
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:53,745
UP THE BEER BOTTLE FROM THE

204
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:54,613
BASIN THAT'S OUR SUPPLY AND AT

205
00:06:54,613 --> 00:06:55,714
EXACTLY EVERY MINUTE RIGHT ON

206
00:06:55,714 --> 00:06:56,848
THE BUTTON SHE BRINGS IT OVER

207
00:06:56,848 --> 00:06:57,883
DROPS THE BEER BOTTLE RIGHT

208
00:06:57,883 --> 00:06:59,051
HERE ON OUR TOP SHELF THAT'S

209
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:00,652
OUR MINUTE SHELF AND THAT

210
00:07:00,652 --> 00:07:02,854
CARRIES ON UNTIL YOU GET 9

211
00:07:02,854 --> 00:07:03,755
BOTTLES ON THERE ON THE TENTH

212
00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:05,857
BOTTLE THE WEIGHT ALL CHANGES

213
00:07:05,857 --> 00:07:07,926
AND SHE SWINGS DOWN AND 9

214
00:07:07,926 --> 00:07:09,461
OF THE BOTTLES DROP INTO THE

215
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:11,463
EAVESTROUGH AND CARRY RIGHT ON

216
00:07:11,463 --> 00:07:13,065
BACK INTO THE BASIN FOR A SUPPLY

217
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,933
AGAIN BUT THE TENTH BOTTLE GOES

218
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:16,935
INTO THE 10 MINUTES AREA SO

219
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:19,338
THAT'S NOW 10 MINUTES AND THEN

220
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:20,305
THAT KIND OF REPEATS ITSELF

221
00:07:20,305 --> 00:07:21,840
AND NOW WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU

222
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,608
BUILD UP UNTIL YOU HAVE I GUESS

223
00:07:23,608 --> 00:07:27,646

224
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:28,480
10 ON THE 10 MINUTES AND

225
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,583
THEN INTO THE HOURS AND

226
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,685
DOWN AND AROUND AND JUST IT'S

227
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:35,153
LIKE CLOCKWORK AND THE BEAUTY

228
00:07:35,153 --> 00:07:36,822
OF THIS MACHINE IS THAT

229
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:37,889
WHENEVER YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT

230
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:39,257
TIME IT IS YOU JUST TAKE A LOOK

231
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:40,592
OVER AT YOUR FRIDGE BEER BOTTLE

232
00:07:40,592 --> 00:07:42,761
CLOCK AND YOU ADD UP THE MINUTES

233
00:07:42,761 --> 00:07:43,995
AND YOU'VE GOT 4 THERE.

234
00:07:43,995 --> 00:07:45,964
SO THAT'S 4 MINUTES PLUS YOU

235
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:48,667
ADD UP THE TENS WE'VE GOT 3

236
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:50,535
TENS AND THEN WE GOT 1, 2, 3,

237
00:07:50,535 --> 00:07:53,138
4 HOURS SO YOU PUT THEM ALL

238
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:55,006
TOGETHER AND THAT MEANS

239
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:58,076
THAT IT'S EXACTLY

240
00:07:58,076 --> 00:08:02,280

TIME FOR A BEER.

242
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:06,251
THIS WOULD MAKE A DANDY ALARM

243
00:08:06,251 --> 00:08:09,888
CLOCK WOULDN'T IT?

244

MIND GIVING THE KID A HAND

277
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,398
HE HAD SOME GOOD IDEAS

278
00:09:26,398 --> 00:09:29,567
THEY WERE ROUGH BUT GOOD.

00:09:33,538 --> 00:09:34,906
HOW IT IS THAT YOU KNOW

ALBERT THAT'S ALL MUCH MUCH

286
00:09:42,447 --> 00:09:43,715
FASTER SO WE AGED

287
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:47,585
AT DIFFERENT RATES.

TALKING ABOUT.

295
00:09:58,763 --> 00:10:00,765
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT TIME

296
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:02,700
AND SPACE IS RELATE-TIVE

297
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,138
AND SUBJECTIVE.

WENT FROM DARK TO LIGHT

303
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:19,984
IT WENT FROM STRAIGHT TO CURLY

304
00:10:19,984 --> 00:10:22,754
AND EVENTUALLY IT JUST WENT.

305

A SAFE WAY TO STORE THINGS.

468
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:54,324
PUT EVERYTHING ABOUT THE MIDDLE

469
00:14:54,324 --> 00:14:55,192
OF THE BURLAP AND THEN YOU

470
00:14:55,192 --> 00:14:58,529
NEED SOME SORT OF A WATERPROOF

471
00:14:58,529 --> 00:14:59,296
FABRIC TO GO OVER THE BURLAP

472
00:14:59,296 --> 00:15:00,097

479

00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,443
NOW OVER THE BRANCH OF A TREE

484
00:15:12,443 --> 00:15:13,644
YOU SEE THE IDEA BEING THIS

485
00:15:13,644 --> 00:15:14,778
IS GOING TO MAKE IT HARD

486
00:15:14,778 --> 00:15:18,348
FOR THE ANIMALS TO GET AT.

487
00:15:18,348 --> 00:15:19,583
BILL DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF

488
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:20,484
MOTOR SKILLS WHEN IT COMES

489
00:15:20,484 --> 00:15:21,351
TO SWINGING THINGS AROUND

490
00:15:21,351 --> 00:15:26,557
AND THROWING THEM AT PARTIES

491
00:15:26,557 --> 00:15:27,458
YOU KNOW NO, NO, NO, NO, BILL

492

NOW I DON'T LIKE TO BUD IN

493
00:15:28,258 --> 00:15:29,092
BECAUSE BILL IS THE EXPERT

494
00:15:29,092 --> 00:15:31,662
ON THE OUTDOOR STUFF BUT

495
00:15:31,662 --> 00:15:33,263
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THINGS

496
00:15:33,263 --> 00:15:34,198
WOULD PROBABLY GO A LITTLE

497
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:35,098
BETTER IF YOU THREW THE END

498
00:15:35,098 --> 00:15:37,167
OF THE ROPE OVER RATHER THAN

499
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:38,569
THROW THE BAG OVER.

500
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:39,269
YEAH THEN IT'S JUST A

501
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:40,204
SIMPLE TASK OF PULLING

502
00:15:40,204 --> 00:15:41,905

GUYS FROM THE UNIVERSITY THERE

728
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:04,393

00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,300
LIKE A PREHISTORIC ANIMAL

734
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,402

THE POSSUM LAKE MONSTER

741
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:31,821
HAS KIND OF BEEN CLEARED UP.

742
00:21:31,821 --> 00:21:32,755
I SHOULD HAVE GUESSED IT

743
00:21:32,755 --> 00:21:33,656
WAS A SUBMARINE WHEN ONE

744
00:21:33,656 --> 00:21:34,490
DESCRIPTION SAID THE TAIL

745
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:39,428
WAS A CHROME PROPELLER.

>>RED: WELL IT WAS UNTIL MOOSE

748
00:21:42,898 --> 00:21:44,700
THOMPSON CHASED IT UP ON SHORE

749
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,935
AND IT WEDGED BETWEEN

750
00:21:45,935 --> 00:21:48,871
THE DOCK AND THE BOATHOUSE.

751
00:21:48,871 --> 00:21:49,505
>>HAROLD: SO NOW IT'S

752
00:21:49,505 --> 00:21:51,374
A SUBMARINE SANDWICH.

00:21:51,374 --> 00:22:03,552
(GIGGLING & SNORTING)

754
00:22:03,552 --> 00:22:04,887
BECAUSE IT WAS LIKE IT WAS

755
00:22:04,887 --> 00:22:05,988
THERE AND SQUISHED RIGHT?

756
00:22:05,988 --> 00:22:08,958
BECAUSE SANDWICH YOU SAID

757
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:11,994

758

LOOKING AT RIGHT THERE.

763
00:22:20,403 --> 00:22:21,337
SO I WOULD RECOMMEND PLAY HARD

764
00:22:21,337 --> 00:22:25,274

769
00:22:29,378 --> 00:22:30,346
SOME KIND OF A MARINE SURVEY

770
00:22:30,346 --> 00:22:31,380

771
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,581
NO FISH IN POSSUM LAKE

772
00:22:32,581 --> 00:22:33,582

ISN'T IT HAROLD?

775
00:22:35,384 --> 00:22:36,318
THERE'S PLENTY OF FISH

776

THIS SHOW BUT ONE THING

792
00:22:55,771 --> 00:22:57,239
I THINK WE'VE PROVEN IS

793
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:58,307
THAT SOMETHING CAN BE

794
