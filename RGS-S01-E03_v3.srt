IN THE HISTORY OF TELEVISION,

00:00:46,412 --> 00:00:47,380
THE PROGRAM THAT HAS

00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,715
RESHAPED THE MEDIUM AND IS

10
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,682
LEADING THE WAY IN TERMS OF

11
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:51,885
CONTENT, LOOK, AND SHEER POWER.

00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,170
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, HAROLD.

22
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:11,838
THANK YOU,

23
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,439
AND WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

24
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,274
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

25
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,975
WE GOT A REAL DYNAMIC SHOW

26
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:16,643
FOR YOU TONIGHT,

27
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,945

GOOD SHOW.

>> DON'T DO THAT!

32
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:29,956
>> SORRY.

33
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:30,623
WE WERE UP A BIT LATE

34
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:31,524
LAST NIGHT.

35
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:33,526
WE WERE LOOKING FOR UFOs,

36
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:34,327
YOU KNOW, WEIRD THINGS

37
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:36,396
FROM OUTER SPACE.

38
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:37,297
SPEAKING OF WHICH, COME ON

39
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:40,033
OVER HERE A MINUTE, HAROLD.

40
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,201
HAROLD IS MY NEPHEW AND ALSO

41
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:43,970
THE PRODUCER AND THE DIRECTOR

42
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:44,671
OF THE SHOW.

43
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:45,471
HE'S A REAL

44
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:46,739
JERK-OF-ALL-TRADES.

45
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:49,208
>> PLUS I DO THIS.

46
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:50,143
THAT TAKES US INTO

47
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,210
A NEXT SEGMENT, YOU KNOW,

48
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,445
IN CASE THIS ONE'S DRAGGING

49
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,746
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

50
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,248
SO NATURALLY I, YOU KNOW,

51
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:56,482
NEED ALL THESE BUTTONS.

52
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:57,283
[laughs]

53
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,619
I'M BUSY.

54
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,020
>> YEAH, WELL, SO ANYHOW,

55
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,687
LIKE I SAY,

56
00:02:01,687 --> 00:02:02,889
WE WERE WATCHING FOR UFOs.

57
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:04,157
WE WERE HAVING A SKINNY-DIP

58
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:05,024
AFTER DINNER,

59
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:06,526
AND WE SAW THIS HUGE THING

60
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,194
KIND OF GO THROUGH THE AIR.

61
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:09,162
WE THOUGHT AT FIRST THAT IT WAS

62
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,963
MOOSE THOMPSON, BUT THIS SEEMED

63
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:12,732
TO HAVE SOME INTELLIGENCE TO IT.

64
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:13,533
>> DID IT LOOK ANYTHING

65
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:16,702
LIKE THIS?

66
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:18,037
>> NO, NOT AT ALL.

67
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:19,305
>> OH, WELL, THAT ELIMINATES

68
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,506
THAT.

69
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:21,641
>> THAT ELIMINATES WHAT?

70
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,609
>> YOU FINISHING YOUR STORY.

71
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:26,361
[folky guitar and spoons music plays]

72
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,715
>> WE GO OUT EVERY FRIDAY

73
00:02:29,715 --> 00:02:31,551
DRINKIN' WITH THE BOYS

74
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,386
WE RAISE UP A RUCKUS

75
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:36,989
AND MAKE LOTS OF NOISE

76

>> BREAK MOST OF OUR--

77
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:39,192
>> BREAK--

78
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,459
>> MOST OF OUR PROMISES

79
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:41,194
>> NO.

80
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:42,962
WE BREAK ALL OUR PROMISES

81
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:45,164
AND MOST OF OUR TOYS

82
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:46,132
FRIDAY NIGHT

83
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,600
DRINKIN' WITH THE BOYS

84
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,267
>> BOYS

00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:49,135
>> THANKS, THERE.

00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,139
DRINKIN' WITH THE BOYS

00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,774
200 BEERS

EACH ONE OF US DESTROYS

00:02:56,909 --> 00:02:59,145
I LOVE TO GO DRINKIN'

00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:02,448
DRINKIN' WITH THE BOYS

92
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,650
TOO BAD THEY'RE ALL DEAD NOW

93
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:17,797
THIS WEEK IN

94
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,298
THE HANDYMAN CORNER,

95
00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:21,067
WE'RE GONNA SHOW YOU HOW TO--

96
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,601
HOW TO REFINISH FURNITURE.

97
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:23,269
AND THIS IS KIND OF A--

98
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:24,070
KIND OF A NEW TECHNIQUE

99
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,471
THAT WE'RE USING HERE.

100
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:26,973
NOW, ORDINARILY WHEN I WAS GONNA

101
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,040
REFINISH, SAY, A BEAUTIFUL OLD

102
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,875
CHAIR LIKE THIS, I WOULD TAKE

103
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,143
JUST AN ORDINARY DINNER KNIFE

104
00:03:31,143 --> 00:03:33,512
AND JUST KIND OF, YOU KNOW,

105
00:03:33,512 --> 00:03:35,815
GET THAT PAINT AND WHAT HAVE YOU

106
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,350
OFF OF THERE.

107
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,818
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT

108
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,286
IT DOES CREATE THE OCCASIONAL

109
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,321
BLEMISH ON THE FURNITURE,

110
00:03:42,321 --> 00:03:44,690
AND IT MAKES DINNER TASTE FUNNY.

111
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,891
NOW, THE ALTERNATIVE THAT MOST

112
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:47,059
PEOPLE GO WITH IS SOME SORT

113
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:49,261
OF A CHEMICAL STRIPPER.

114
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:50,162
DON'T EVER SAY THAT AROUND

115
00:03:50,162 --> 00:03:52,031
OLD MAN SEDGEWICK.

116
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,165
BUT WE DON'T LIKE TO USE THE

117
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:55,468
CHEMICALS UP AT THE LODGE,

118
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,303
BECAUSE ONE TIME,

119
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,338
STINKY PETERSON STRIPPED DOWN

120
00:03:59,338 --> 00:04:01,140
THE TWO-HOLER,

121
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,374
AND HE HASN'T BEEN ABLE

122
00:04:02,374 --> 00:04:03,442
TO THINK OF ANYTHING

123
00:04:03,442 --> 00:04:04,143
THAT HAPPENED BETWEEN

124
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,245
1985 AND 1987.

125
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:07,646
SO WHAT WE LIKE TO USE--

126
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:08,347
AND I THINK THE BEST WAY

127
00:04:08,347 --> 00:04:09,048
TO TAKE A FINISH

128
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:09,815
OFF OLD FURNITURE--

129
00:04:09,815 --> 00:04:11,784
IS ONE OF THOSE HEAT GUNS,

130
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,018
WHICH WILL COST YOU ACTUALLY

131
00:04:13,018 --> 00:04:14,320
UP TO ABOUT 40 BUCKS.

132
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,288
BUT WE HAVE A WAY AROUND THAT.

133
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:17,656
I'M SURE EVERYBODY HAS A FEW

134
00:04:17,656 --> 00:04:18,757
HAIR DRYERS LYING AROUND

135
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:19,859
THE HOUSE--

136
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:20,993
YOU KNOW, ONE IN THE KIDS' ROOM,

137
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:22,461
ONE IN THE DAUGHTER'S ROOM,

138
00:04:22,461 --> 00:04:23,129
ONE IN THE WIFE'S ROOM,

139
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:23,996
MAYBE ONE IN THE GRANDMOTHER'S

140
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:24,930
ROOM, AND ONE IN YOUR OWN ROOM.

141
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,332
MAYBE YOU USE THEM TO DRY THE

142
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:28,400
BABY'S BOTTOM OR WHATEVER.

143
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,335
WHAT YOU DO IS, YOU GET ABOUT

144
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,569
SIX OF THESE TOGETHER, AND THEN

145
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:31,904
YOU GET AN OLD BROKEN-DOWN

146
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:34,373
HOCKEY STICK LIKE THIS--

147
00:04:34,373 --> 00:04:35,374
NO, THIS IS ACTUALLY

148
00:04:35,374 --> 00:04:37,276
A GOOD HOCKEY STICK.

149
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:38,344
WELL, I DON'T WANT TO USE

150
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:40,312
A GOOD HOCKEY STICK FOR THIS.

151
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,492
THERE.

152
00:04:53,492 --> 00:04:54,193
OKAY.

153
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:55,594
NOW WE GOT THE HOCKEY STICK.

154
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:57,997
AND WHAT WE DO IS, WE ATTACH

155
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,966
THE HAIR DRYERS TO THE STICK

156
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:03,002
USING THE HANDYMAN'S

157
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:07,439
SECRET WEAPON:

158
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:10,142
DUCT TAPE.

159
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:11,310
ALL RIGHT, WELL, WE GOT HER ALL

160
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,311
SET HERE, AND I GOT THEM ALL

161
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:13,212
KIND OF GENERALLY POINTING

162
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,046
THE SAME DIRECTION.

163
00:05:14,046 --> 00:05:15,514
NOW, THE PROBLEM I COULD RUN

164
00:05:15,514 --> 00:05:16,915
INTO IS, THESE ARE ABOUT

165
00:05:16,915 --> 00:05:19,318
1,500 WATTS OF POWER EACH.

166
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:20,185
AND WE GOT SIX OF THEM.

167
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:23,489
SO THERE'S, I GUESS, OVER 7,000

168
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,057
OR 8,000 WATTS OF POWER THERE,

169
00:05:25,057 --> 00:05:26,058
WHICH IS TOO MUCH FOR YOUR

170
00:05:26,058 --> 00:05:28,193
NORMAL HOUSEHOLD CIRCUIT.

171
00:05:28,193 --> 00:05:29,228
SO WHAT I DONE WAS,

172
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:30,129
I TOOK THE FUSE OUT,

173
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,364
AND I REPLACED IT WITH A NICKEL.

174
00:05:32,364 --> 00:05:34,666
WORKS GREAT AND ONLY COSTS 5¢.

175
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,802
SO ANYWAY, WE'LL PICK THIS BABY

176
00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:38,003
UP, AND WE'RE READY TO SHOW YOU

177
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:39,204
HOW IT WORKS ON THE CHAIR.

178
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:39,872
ALL RIGHT.

179
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:40,606
DO YOU WANT TO HIT THE POWER

180
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:41,273
THERE?

181
00:05:41,273 --> 00:05:44,243
[hair dryers blowing]

182
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,380
THE CHAIR MAYBE DOESN'T NEED

183
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,915
AS MUCH AS THE WORKBENCH.

184
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:54,019
WE CAN USE IT ON THE WORKBENCH.

185
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:56,922
WELL, YOU GET THE IDEA.

186
00:05:56,922 --> 00:05:59,391
SO REMEMBER, UNTIL NEXT TIME--

187
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:00,392
YOU WANT TO KILL THE POWER?

188
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:02,861
UNTIL NEXT TIME, IF YOU CAN'T

189
00:06:02,861 --> 00:06:04,329
BE A HANDSOME MAN,

190
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:05,497
YOU CAN BE A HANDYMAN

191
00:06:05,497 --> 00:06:07,466
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

192
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:11,904
>> UNCLE RED WILL BE RIGHT BACK

193
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,472
WITH HIS EXTRATERRESTRIALS.

194
00:06:13,472 --> 00:06:14,807
>> HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

195
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:15,741
I HAVE THE SAME NUMBER OF

196
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:17,843
TERRESTRIALS AS ANYBODY ELSE.

197
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:27,452
>> YOU KNOW, HAROLD, I'VE MET

198
00:06:27,452 --> 00:06:29,421
SOME PEOPLE OVER THE YEARS,

199
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:30,222
VEGETARIANS.

200
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:31,056
YOU EVER HEARD OF THEM?

201
00:06:31,056 --> 00:06:31,723
>> YEAH.

202
00:06:31,723 --> 00:06:32,724
THEY'RE PEOPLE WHO WON'T EAT

203
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:33,959
MEAT UNLESS IT'S, LIKE,

204
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,227
GROWN IN THE GROUND.

205
00:06:35,227 --> 00:06:36,962
>> YEAH, YEAH.

206
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:38,096
I HOPE THIS NEVER HAPPENS

207
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:39,064
TO YOU, HAROLD.

208
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:40,032
HAVE YOU SEEN THEM?

209
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:41,466
THEY LOOK LIKE BIG GREEN BEANS.

210
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:43,135
>> THEY'RE A LITTLE PALE.

211
00:06:43,135 --> 00:06:43,802
>> THEY'RE NOT PALE.

212
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:44,469
THEY'RE GREEN.

213
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:45,137
>> GREEN.

214
00:06:45,137 --> 00:06:45,804
>> YEAH.

215
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:46,471
I MEAN, I GUESS THERE'S

216
00:06:46,471 --> 00:06:47,406
A GREEN PALE, SO IN THAT WAY,

217
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:48,240
YOU COULD SAY THEY'RE PALE.

218
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,374
>> THAT'S TRUE.

219
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:50,275
I DON'T GET THAT.

220
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:50,976
>> OKAY.

221
00:06:50,976 --> 00:06:52,411
BUT THE THING IS, YOU ARE

222
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,279
WHAT YOU EAT, RIGHT?

223
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,113
>> UH-OH.

224
00:06:55,113 --> 00:06:55,914
>> WHY DO YOU THINK WE NEVER

225
00:06:55,914 --> 00:06:57,683
HAVE RUMP ROAST?

226
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:58,917
>> THAT EXPLAINS A LOT.

227
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:00,485
>> WELL, YEAH.

228
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:02,487
THE VEGETARIAN THING TO ME IS,

229
00:07:02,487 --> 00:07:04,656
THAT'S AN ANIMAL THING.

230
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:06,024
RABBIT?

231
00:07:06,024 --> 00:07:07,993
>> LOOK OUT!

232
00:07:10,462 --> 00:07:12,297
BE VERY CALM.

233
00:07:12,297 --> 00:07:15,200
THEY CAN SMELL FEAR.

234
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,635
>> [sniffs] SO CAN I.

235
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:17,436
>> THAT'S ME.

236
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:18,370
I'M SORRY.

237
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,237
I WAS A LITTLE MORE AFRAID

238
00:07:19,237 --> 00:07:20,639
THAN HE WAS.

239
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,640
>> SEE, IF YOU WERE A

240
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,674
VEGETARIAN, WE MAY NOT HAVE

241
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:23,742
HAD THAT PROBLEM.

242
00:07:23,742 --> 00:07:24,643
>> WELL, IF I WAS A VEGETARIAN,

243
00:07:24,643 --> 00:07:27,612
I WOULD'VE ATE HIM.

244
00:07:27,612 --> 00:07:28,680
THERE'S NO MEAT ON A BUG

245
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,649
LIKE THAT.

246
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:38,323
>> "IT IS WINTER,

247
00:07:38,323 --> 00:07:40,158
A TIME TO PAUSE.

248
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:41,326
THE DRIVEWAY IS HALF

249
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:42,360
SHOVELED OUT,

250
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,096
BUT I LAY DOWN THE SHOVEL,

251
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,430
AND I PAUSE TO ENJOY

252
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,898
THIS MOMENT.

253
00:07:46,898 --> 00:07:48,867
AFTER ALL, THIS IS MY FIRST

254
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:50,836
HEART ATTACK."

255
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:54,039
SO ANYWAY, LIKE I WAS SAYING

256
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:57,109
ABOUT UFO SIGHTINGS,

257
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:58,276
THE BUNCH OF US WERE HAVING

258
00:07:58,276 --> 00:07:59,744
A LATE-NIGHT SKINNY-DIP LAST

259
00:07:59,744 --> 00:08:02,647
NIGHT, AND THIS UFO COME DOWN

260
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:04,449
ABOUT TREETOP LEVEL, HOVERED

261
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:05,484
THERE FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

262
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:06,585
THEN IT TOOK OFF ABOUT

263
00:08:06,585 --> 00:08:08,053
A TRILLION MILES AN HOUR,

264
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:09,688
AND IT COMES ROLLING BACK DOWN,

265
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:10,889
SCREECHES TO A HALT

266
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:12,424
BUT WITH A SCREECH.

267
00:08:12,424 --> 00:08:13,992
>> NO WAY, UNCLE RED.

268
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:15,060
THESE THINGS ALWAYS TURN OUT TO

269
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,995
BE, LIKE, SWAMP GAS OR WEATHER

270
00:08:16,995 --> 00:08:20,932
BALLOONS OR CAFETERIA FOOD.

271
00:08:20,932 --> 00:08:21,867
>> THERE ARE ALIENS,

272
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:22,767
AND THEY EXIST, HAROLD.

273
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:23,802
AND THEY'RE WATCHING US.

274
00:08:23,802 --> 00:08:24,736
IT'S JUST THAT THE GOVERNMENT

275
00:08:24,736 --> 00:08:25,737
IS KEEPING THE WHOLE THING

276
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:27,105
A BIG SECRET.

277
00:08:27,105 --> 00:08:29,074
>> WELL, SO AM I.

278
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:42,087
>> THIS HERE IS THE FIRST BOOK

279
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:43,154
I EVER READ.

280
00:08:43,154 --> 00:08:43,822
IT'S THREE OR FOUR

281
00:08:43,822 --> 00:08:44,623
YEARS AGO NOW.

282
00:08:44,623 --> 00:08:46,424
IT'S THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS

283
00:08:46,424 --> 00:08:48,093
BY KENNETH GRAHAME.

284
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:49,394
"THERE'S NOTHING QUITE AS GOOD

285
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:51,796
AS MESSING IN BOATS."

286
00:08:51,796 --> 00:08:53,164
I'M KIND OF PARAPHRASING.

287
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:54,099
EITHER MESSING IN 'EM OR MESSING

288
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:55,100
OUT OF THEM, JUST MESSING

289
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,301
AROUND WITH BOATS.

290
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:57,702
THAT'S WHAT KENNETH GRAHAME

291
00:08:57,702 --> 00:08:58,470
SAID.

292
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,371
MY FRIEND JIMMY MCVEIGH,

293
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:00,605
HE'S A POSTAL WORKER,

294
00:09:00,605 --> 00:09:01,573
AND HE'S BEEN MESSING AROUND

295
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:02,641
WITH THIS BOAT FOR A WHILE.

296
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:03,975
AND ACTUALLY, HE'S MADE QUITE

297
00:09:03,975 --> 00:09:05,644
A MESS OF IT, HASN'T HE?

298
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:07,178
OH, HERE COMES JIMMY NOW.

299
00:09:07,178 --> 00:09:08,279
HOW YOU DOING, JIM?

300
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,180
>> BLOODY HELL.

301
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,115
LOOK AT THIS.

302
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:10,882
LOOK AT THAT, RED.

303
00:09:10,882 --> 00:09:11,583
>> GOD.

304
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:12,517
>> ANOTHER BLOODY PAIR OF PANTS

305
00:09:12,517 --> 00:09:13,318
RUINED.

306
00:09:13,318 --> 00:09:14,219
>> OH, BOY.

307
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:15,987
>> I TAKE MY LIFE IN MY HANDS

308
00:09:15,987 --> 00:09:17,255
EVERY TIME I GO OUT

309
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:18,390
ON THIS CAREER.

310
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,424
I MEAN, I RISK MY LIFE

311
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:21,326
FOR PEOPLE LIKE ED MCMAHON.

312
00:09:21,326 --> 00:09:22,861
BLOODY JUNK MAIL.

313
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:24,162
I COULD GET RABIES, YOU KNOW.

314
00:09:24,162 --> 00:09:25,130
>> BOY, DOGS HATE POSTIES,

315
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:25,930
DON'T THEY, JIM?

316
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:26,898
>> DOGS?

317
00:09:26,898 --> 00:09:28,333
THAT WAS NO DOG DID THAT.

318
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,567
A MAN BIT ME!

319
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:31,002
BLOODY LUNATIC, JUST BECAUSE

320
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:32,137
I WAS A COUPLE OF WEEKS LATE

321
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:34,472
DELIVERING HIS PENSION CHECK.

322
00:09:34,472 --> 00:09:35,473
>> IT WAS AN OLD MAN?

323
00:09:35,473 --> 00:09:36,708
>> IT WAS.

324
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:37,776
YEAH, THE SENIOR CITIZENS,

325
00:09:37,776 --> 00:09:38,643
THEY GO OFF THEIR NUT, YOU KNOW.

326
00:09:38,643 --> 00:09:39,310
THEY DO.

327
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,178
THEY'RE BONKERS JUST BECAUSE

328
00:09:40,178 --> 00:09:40,845
THEY DIDN'T GET A LETTER

329
00:09:40,845 --> 00:09:41,746
FROM HOME OR FROM THE

330
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:42,647
GRANDCHILDREN.

331
00:09:42,647 --> 00:09:43,448
WHY CAN'T THEY PICK UP

332
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:46,117
THE BLOODY TELEPHONE?

333
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:47,085
>> WELL, LET'S FORGET THAT.

334
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:48,186
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BOAT.

335
00:09:48,186 --> 00:09:49,120
THAT'S A DIFFERENT THING.

336
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,821
>> NOW YOU'RE TALKING

337
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:50,522
MY LANGUAGE.

338
00:09:50,522 --> 00:09:51,189
>> YEAH, YEAH.

339
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:51,856
>> I MEAN, LOOK AT THAT.

340
00:09:51,856 --> 00:09:52,724
MY SALVA--

341
00:09:52,724 --> 00:09:54,159
THIS BOAT IS MY SALVATION.

342
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:54,826
>> YEAH.

343
00:09:54,826 --> 00:09:55,627
>> THIS IS MY RELIEF IN LIFE.

344
00:09:55,627 --> 00:09:56,294
>> YEAH.

345
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:57,061
>> MY DARLING.

346
00:09:57,061 --> 00:09:57,796
MY BEAUTY.

347
00:09:57,796 --> 00:09:58,463
>> YEAH.

348
00:09:58,463 --> 00:09:59,130
>> I LOVE HER.

349
00:09:59,130 --> 00:09:59,798
>> YEAH.

350
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:00,865
THIS BOAT'S LIKE A WIFE FOR YOU,

351
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:01,799
ISN'T IT, JIM?

352
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,700
>> RED, THIS BOAT IS NOT

353
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,434
LIKE A WIFE.

354
00:10:03,434 --> 00:10:04,269
THIS BOAT IS HERE WHEN

355
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:05,670
I COME HOME EVERY AFTERNOON.

356
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,371
>> OH, YEAH.

357
00:10:06,371 --> 00:10:07,372
>> I MEAN, THIS BOAT DID NOT

358
00:10:07,372 --> 00:10:08,973
TAKE OFF WITH THE TV

359
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:10,375
AND THE VC-BLOODY-R.

360
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,209
>> NO.

361
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:12,277
>> OH, HO, HO. NO, NO.

362
00:10:12,277 --> 00:10:17,248
THIS BOAT IS MY FRIEND.

363
00:10:17,248 --> 00:10:18,416
>> YOU KNOW, JIMMY,

364
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,250
KENNETH GRAHAME SAID

365
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,151
THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT

366
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:21,319
THAN MESSING ABOUT IN BOATS,

367
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:23,288
AND, WELL, THIS IS FOR YOU.

368
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:24,489
>> JEEZ, THANKS VERY MUCH, RED.

369
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:25,223
>> NO PROBLEM.

370
00:10:25,223 --> 00:10:25,890
>> I THINK I COULD MAKE

371
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,591
GOOD USE OF THIS.

372
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:27,258
>> UH-HUH.

373
00:10:27,258 --> 00:10:28,326
>> I NEED A 3/4 INCH SHIM

374
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:29,661
FOR THAT MOTOR IN THERE.

375
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:30,929
>> NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, JIMMY.

376
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:32,163
THIS IS AN ORIGINAL AUTOGRAPHED

377
00:10:32,163 --> 00:10:33,097
EDITION, YOU KNOW,

378
00:10:33,097 --> 00:10:34,032
BY THE AUTHOR.

379
00:10:34,032 --> 00:10:34,832
>> OH, I SEE.

380
00:10:34,832 --> 00:10:35,633
WELL, I ONLY NEED

381
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:37,035
TO TAKE IT DOWN TO 3/4.

382
00:10:37,035 --> 00:10:38,069
>> JIMMY, JIMMY, JIMMY.

383
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:39,904
THIS BOOK'S WORTH $270.

384
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:40,939
>> WELL, THAT BLOODY MOTOR IN

385
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:42,941
THERE IS WORTH $2,000, SO YOU

386
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:45,376
TELL ME WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT.

387
00:10:45,376 --> 00:10:47,745
HERE'S 60 BUCKS' WORTH.

388
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,330
[folksy guitar and spoons music plays]

389
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:52,450
>> I'M UP PAST THE TUNDRA

390
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,818
WHERE THE POLAR BEARS DANCE

391
00:10:53,818 --> 00:10:54,485
>> DANCE

392
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:55,486
>> I GOT SNOW IN MY FACE

393
00:10:55,486 --> 00:10:57,188
AND ICE IN MY PANTS

394
00:10:57,188 --> 00:10:58,389
I'M FISHING THE ARCTIC

395
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:00,091
AND I JUST HAD TO PHONE YA

396
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:00,892
'CAUSE I CAUGHT

397
00:11:00,892 --> 00:11:01,926
SOMETHING BIG

398
00:11:01,926 --> 00:11:03,094
>> DOUBLE PNEUMONIA

399
00:11:03,094 --> 00:11:05,063
[laughs]

400
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:09,600
OH, UNCLE RED,

401
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,435
THAT IS SO WEIRD.

402
00:11:10,435 --> 00:11:11,269
I WAS JUST GONNA READ FROM THE

403
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:12,203
VIEWER MAIL, AND EVERY TIME,

404
00:11:12,203 --> 00:11:13,671
YOU WALK IN.

405
00:11:13,671 --> 00:11:14,505
>> FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE.

406
00:11:14,505 --> 00:11:15,206
>> THAT'S WEIRD, EH?

407
00:11:15,206 --> 00:11:15,940
THAT'S WEIRD.

408
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,641
THAT'S SO WEIRD.

409
00:11:16,641 --> 00:11:17,742
ANYWAY, HERE'S A LETTER, OKAY?

410
00:11:17,742 --> 00:11:19,310
IT SAYS, "DEAR RED, I'VE BEEN

411
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,478
WATCHING YOUR SHOW FOR A SHORT

412
00:11:20,478 --> 00:11:22,480
TIME NOW, BUT IT SEEMS LONGER.

413
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,448
I REALLY LIKE WHEN YOU DO

414
00:11:23,448 --> 00:11:25,249
FEATURES ON WINTER ACTIVITIES.

415
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:26,184
HAVE YOU EVER DONE ANYTHING

416
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:27,385
ON SNOWMOBILES?"

417
00:11:27,385 --> 00:11:29,487
>> OH, YOU KNOW THAT, HAROLD.

418
00:11:29,487 --> 00:11:30,288
I CERTAINLY HAVE.

419
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:31,355
I'VE RIDDEN ON THEM.

420
00:11:31,355 --> 00:11:32,690
I'VE STOOD UP ON THEM.

421
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:33,458
I WENT INTO A COUPLE OF TREES

422
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,392
ON THEM.

423
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:35,193
I REMEMBER ONE TIME, I--

424
00:11:35,193 --> 00:11:36,027
>> NO, NO, UNCLE RED,

425
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:37,095
I THINK HE MEANS ON THE SHOW.

426
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:37,895
LIKE, HAVE YOU EVER DONE

427
00:11:37,895 --> 00:11:39,097
A SEGMENT ON SNOWMOBILES?

428
00:11:39,097 --> 00:11:40,431
>> OH.

429
00:11:40,431 --> 00:11:41,332
OH, WELL, YES.

430
00:11:41,332 --> 00:11:42,366
YES, WE HAVE.

431
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:43,267
JUST LAST YEAR THERE,

432
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:45,470
I WAS OUT FISHING FOR WALLEYE,

433
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,538
AND I HOOKED INTO A SNOWMOBILE

434
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:48,606
WHICH HAD GONE THROUGH THE ICE

435
00:11:48,606 --> 00:11:49,807
THE PREVIOUS WINTER.

436
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:50,675
AND I PULLED HER RIGHT UP

437
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:51,776
INTO THE BOAT.

438
00:11:51,776 --> 00:11:52,977
>> OH, YOU MUST HAVE, WHAT, HAD,

439
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:54,545
LIKE, 1,000-POUND-TEST LINE?

440
00:11:54,545 --> 00:11:56,647
>> WELL, YOU KNOW ME.

441
00:11:56,647 --> 00:11:57,515
AND IF ANY OF THE VIEWERS AT

442
00:11:57,515 --> 00:11:59,851
HOME WANTED TO TRY FISHING FOR

443
00:11:59,851 --> 00:12:01,319
SNOWMOBILES, WHAT YOU DO IS,

444
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:03,321
YOU RUN YOUR LINE VERY DEEP,

445
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:06,524
BIG HOOK, NO BAIT, AND DO YOUR

446
00:12:06,524 --> 00:12:07,491
FISHING OUT IN THE CENTER

447
00:12:07,491 --> 00:12:08,526
OF THE LAKE WHERE THE ICE

448
00:12:08,526 --> 00:12:10,595
IS THE THINNEST IN THE WINTER.

449
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:11,629
AND THOSE THINGS'LL GIVE YOU

450
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:13,197
A HECK OF A FIGHT, A LOT MORE

451
00:12:13,197 --> 00:12:14,565
THAN, SAY, A CAR TIRE

452
00:12:14,565 --> 00:12:16,334
OR EVEN AN OUTBOARD MOTOR.

453
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:17,068
>> YEAH?

454
00:12:17,068 --> 00:12:17,868
OH, JEEPERS.

455
00:12:17,868 --> 00:12:18,869
NOW, THAT'S FISHING.

456
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:20,071
>> WELL, WE HAD A HECK OF A TIME

457
00:12:20,071 --> 00:12:21,472
LANDING THAT, THOUGH.

458
00:12:21,472 --> 00:12:22,773
YOU KNOW, WE USED A NINE-FOOT

459
00:12:22,773 --> 00:12:25,509
DIP NET, LOTS OF ROPE, AND I BET

460
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:27,378
THE BOAT CAPSIZED 300, 400,

461
00:12:27,378 --> 00:12:28,646
MAYBE 500 TIMES BEFORE WE

462
00:12:28,646 --> 00:12:30,781
ACTUALLY GOT THE UNIT IN THERE.

463
00:12:30,781 --> 00:12:32,249
>> BOY, THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

464
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:33,351
>> WELL, IT'S NOT.

465
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:34,151
>> WELL, LET'S GO

466
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:36,654
TO OUR NEXT SEGMENT.

467
00:12:36,654 --> 00:12:37,722
>> I HAD MORE TO SAY

468
00:12:37,722 --> 00:12:38,756
ABOUT SNOWMOBILES.

469
00:12:38,756 --> 00:12:40,725
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

470
00:12:46,364 --> 00:12:47,264
>> YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS

471
00:12:47,264 --> 00:12:48,933
THAT YOU NEED TO LEARN TO DO

472
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:50,001
WHEN YOU'RE A WOODSMAN

473
00:12:50,001 --> 00:12:51,769
IS TO SET A FIRE.

474
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:53,037
IT'S A SOURCE OF HEAT,

475
00:12:53,037 --> 00:12:54,038
IT'S A SOURCE OF A COOKING,

476
00:12:54,038 --> 00:12:54,939
AND IT'S A SOURCE

477
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:56,440
OF ENTERTAINMENT.

478
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,143
SO BILL IS GONNA SHOW US HOW TO

479
00:12:59,143 --> 00:13:01,946
BUILD A FIRE OUT IN THE WOODS.

480
00:13:01,946 --> 00:13:04,682
GOT SOME PAPER THERE.

481
00:13:04,682 --> 00:13:06,450
ACTUALLY GOT QUITE

482
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,284
A BIT OF STUFF

483
00:13:07,284 --> 00:13:11,422
IN THE OLD COVERALLS THERE.

484
00:13:11,422 --> 00:13:12,323
YOU CAN GET A HECK OF A LOT

485
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:14,792
INTO THOSE COVERALLS.

486
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:16,060
GOT THE BIB THERE.

487
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:20,164
MY GOD, WHAT IS THAT?

488
00:13:20,164 --> 00:13:22,933
OH, HE GRABBED MY WALLET THERE,

489
00:13:22,933 --> 00:13:24,401
HE'S QUITE A KIBITZER,

490
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:26,303
THAT BILL.

491
00:13:26,303 --> 00:13:27,638
HE'S GOT--ACTUALLY GOT MORE

492
00:13:27,638 --> 00:13:30,241
STUFF IN THE COVERALLS THAN I

493
00:13:30,241 --> 00:13:31,408
EVEN THOUGHT HE--BUT YOU GET--

494
00:13:31,408 --> 00:13:32,543
THAT'S--YOU GET THE--

495
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,345
WELL, YOU'RE PRETTY WELL READY

496
00:13:34,345 --> 00:13:36,080
TO LIGHT IT NOW, I THINK.

497
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,081
THAT'S ENOUGH, BILL, ISN'T IT?

498
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:37,982
BILL?

499
00:13:37,982 --> 00:13:39,016
BILL?

500
00:13:39,016 --> 00:13:41,485
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

501
00:13:41,485 --> 00:13:42,286
I GUESS HE'S PLANNING TO DO

502
00:13:42,286 --> 00:13:45,156
SOME COOKING ON THIS.

503
00:13:45,156 --> 00:13:46,757
SO ANYWAY, ONCE HE'S GOT HIS

504
00:13:46,757 --> 00:13:48,192
FIRE ALL SET, IT'S A QUESTION

505
00:13:48,192 --> 00:13:49,493
OF WHAT DO YOU USE TO START IT,

506
00:13:49,493 --> 00:13:50,161
YOU KNOW?

507
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:51,829
AND THOSE ARE MATCHES THERE.

508
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:52,696
THAT'S NORMAL.

509
00:13:52,696 --> 00:13:53,430
OR WE COULD USE A--

510
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,332
I BELIEVE THAT'S A LIGHTER.

511
00:13:55,332 --> 00:13:56,267
MAGNIFYING GLASS.

512
00:13:56,267 --> 00:13:56,967
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW,

513
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:57,768
WITH THE SUN

514
00:13:57,768 --> 00:13:59,570
AND FOCUS THAT IN ON THERE

515
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,072
AND...

516
00:14:02,072 --> 00:14:03,507
WELL, HE HAS A CANDLE

517
00:14:03,507 --> 00:14:07,912
THERE AND...

518
00:14:07,912 --> 00:14:08,712
YOU KNOW, I GOT TO WONDER

519
00:14:08,712 --> 00:14:10,481
WHAT BILL'S UNDERWEAR

520
00:14:10,481 --> 00:14:11,649
IS MADE OUT OF THERE.

521
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:12,750
OH, THIS IS INTERESTING.

522
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,352
HE HAS A CIGARETTE LIGHT--

523
00:14:15,352 --> 00:14:16,120
CIGARETTE LIGHTER

524
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,655
OUT OF THE CAR.

525
00:14:17,655 --> 00:14:18,856
WE'RE KIND OF KIBITZING.

526
00:14:18,856 --> 00:14:19,723
IT WENT DOWN INTO THE--

527
00:14:19,723 --> 00:14:21,926
OH, MY GOD.

528
00:14:21,926 --> 00:14:24,228
OH.

529
00:14:24,228 --> 00:14:25,963
YOU KNOW, BILL CAN REALLY MOVE

530
00:14:25,963 --> 00:14:26,897
WHEN HE'S MOTIVATED.

531
00:14:26,897 --> 00:14:27,831
HE WAS ROCKETIN'

532
00:14:27,831 --> 00:14:28,632
THROUGH THE TREES.

533
00:14:28,632 --> 00:14:31,835
OH.

534
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:32,803
NOW, HERE'S SOMETHING YOU

535
00:14:32,803 --> 00:14:33,804
WOULDN'T NORMALLY THINK OF:

536
00:14:33,804 --> 00:14:35,706
USING JUMPER CABLES

537
00:14:35,706 --> 00:14:37,141
TO START YOUR FIRE.

538
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:40,844
WHAT YOU DO FIRST OF ALL IS

539
00:14:40,844 --> 00:14:42,246
HOOK IT UP TO THE BATTERY

540
00:14:42,246 --> 00:14:44,848
OF YOUR VEHICLE.

541
00:14:44,848 --> 00:14:45,716
[explosion]

542
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:48,385
>> AAH!

543
00:14:48,385 --> 00:14:49,186
>> YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL

544
00:14:49,186 --> 00:14:49,853
WITH THAT.

545
00:14:49,853 --> 00:14:50,788
ANYWAY, ONCE THEY'RE HOOKED UP

546
00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:52,723
AT THAT END, YOU JUST HOOK

547
00:14:52,723 --> 00:14:54,558
THE CABLES RIGHT INTO THE FIRE.

548
00:14:54,558 --> 00:14:55,459
AND I GUESS THE SPARK,

549
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:56,393
THE IDEA IS, THE SPARK

550
00:14:56,393 --> 00:14:58,662
WILL START THIS THING UP.

551
00:14:58,662 --> 00:15:01,632
[engine turning over]

552
00:15:03,901 --> 00:15:06,003
WELL, THERE SHE GOES.

553
00:15:06,003 --> 00:15:07,404
THIS IS A GUN THAT BILL HAD.

554
00:15:07,404 --> 00:15:08,372
YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE A GUN

555
00:15:08,372 --> 00:15:09,673
TO START A FIRE.

556
00:15:09,673 --> 00:15:11,542
[gunshot]

[air whistling]

558
00:15:15,646 --> 00:15:18,282
AND THERE'S DINNER.

559
00:15:18,282 --> 00:15:19,516
SO ALL IN ALL,

560
00:15:19,516 --> 00:15:20,584
IT WAS A HECK OF A DAY.

561
00:15:20,584 --> 00:15:22,820
SUPER TIME.

562
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,221
"IT IS WINTER.

563
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:25,055
IN THE SNOW,

THE TRACKS OF A RABBIT,

THE TRACKS OF THE PHEASANT,

THE TRACKS OF THE DEER,

THE TRACKS OF THE FOX.

00:15:31,595 --> 00:15:32,563
AND THEY ALL STOP

569
00:15:32,563 --> 00:15:34,064
AT THE SAME SPOT:

570
00:15:34,064 --> 00:15:35,199
WHERE THEY WERE RUN OVER BY

THE TRACKS OF THE SNOWMOBILE."

IF ANY OF YOU VIEWERS

573
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:43,207
WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT

574
00:15:43,207 --> 00:15:44,107
OR HAVE ANY QUESTIONS

575
00:15:44,107 --> 00:15:46,243
ABOUT WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN,

576
00:15:46,243 --> 00:15:48,245
PLEASE CALL HAROLD AT HOME,

00:15:48,245 --> 00:15:51,415
NOT ME AND NOT THE STATION.

HAROLD.

WAR.

581
00:15:55,786 --> 00:15:56,620
OKAY?

582
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,487
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

583
00:15:57,487 --> 00:15:58,655

00:16:01,858 --> 00:16:04,061
THAT'S EVERYBODY.

WAR.

588
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:06,196
WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR?

589
00:16:06,196 --> 00:16:07,130
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

590
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:07,798
HA.

591
00:16:07,798 --> 00:16:08,465
WAR.

592
00:16:08,465 --> 00:16:09,199
WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR?

593
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,133
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

594
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:10,968
SAY IT AGAIN.

595
00:16:10,968 --> 00:16:11,635
HA.

596
00:16:11,635 --> 00:16:12,603
[laughs]

597
00:16:12,603 --> 00:16:13,804
THAT'S COOL.

598
00:16:13,804 --> 00:16:15,505
WELL, I GOT TO TELL YOU.

599
00:16:15,505 --> 00:16:16,873
WAR ISN'T GOOD.

600
00:16:16,873 --> 00:16:17,541
RIGHT?

601
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:18,375
IT'S NOT.

602
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,111
IT ONLY BLOWS THINGS UP.

603
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:22,079
AND WAR, IT'S NOT LIKE

604
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,047
A JOHN WAYNE MOVIE OR SOMETHING,

605
00:16:24,047 --> 00:16:26,216
'CAUSE IT'S IN COLOR.

606
00:16:26,216 --> 00:16:27,217
THAT'S TRUE.

607
00:16:27,217 --> 00:16:28,885
YOU KNOW, A GREAT MAN ONCE SAID,

608
00:16:28,885 --> 00:16:31,521
"WAR SUCKS SCISSORS."

609
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:32,589
AND, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

610
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:33,523
BOYS AND GIRLS,

611
00:16:33,523 --> 00:16:34,591
DOGS, CATS, AND FISH,

612
00:16:34,591 --> 00:16:36,393
THAT GREAT MAN WAS ME.

00:16:36,393 --> 00:16:37,394
[laughs]

614
00:16:37,394 --> 00:16:39,363
WAR.

615
00:16:43,967 --> 00:16:45,235
>> I KNOW THAT A LOT OF YOU

616
00:16:45,235 --> 00:16:46,536
TEENAGERS ARE PRETTY CONFUSED

617
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:48,238
ABOUT LIFE THESE DAYS,

618
00:16:48,238 --> 00:16:49,106
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY

619
00:16:49,106 --> 00:16:50,474
OR WHAT TO DO.

620
00:16:50,474 --> 00:16:52,442
THIS IS BECAUSE OF ONE THING:

621
00:16:52,442 --> 00:16:54,745
YOUR GLANDS.

622
00:16:54,745 --> 00:16:55,712
RIGHT NOW, YOU SEE, YOUR GLANDS

623
00:16:55,712 --> 00:16:56,646
ARE TRYING TO TAKE OVER

624
00:16:56,646 --> 00:16:57,914
YOUR BODY.

625
00:16:57,914 --> 00:16:59,082
IN SOME CASES, YOUR GLANDS ARE

626
00:16:59,082 --> 00:17:00,150
TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE BODY OF

627
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,686
THE PERSON STANDING BESIDE YOU.

628
00:17:02,686 --> 00:17:03,720
AND EVERY ONE OF YOUR GLANDS

629
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,122
IS TRYING TO TELL YOU TO DO

630
00:17:05,122 --> 00:17:06,022
SOMETHING DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW,

631
00:17:06,022 --> 00:17:07,457
AND YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL WHICH

632
00:17:07,457 --> 00:17:09,359
GLAND YOU LISTEN TO, BECAUSE YOU

633
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,727
CAN ALWAYS TELL WHICH GLAND IS

634
00:17:10,727 --> 00:17:13,563
DOMINATING A PERSON'S BEHAVIOR.

635
00:17:13,563 --> 00:17:14,564
LIKE, WITH MOOSE THOMPSON,

636
00:17:14,564 --> 00:17:16,099
IT'S HIS STOMACH.

STINKY PETERSON--

638
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:19,736
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

639
00:17:19,736 --> 00:17:20,804
SO NOW THERE YOU ARE GETTING

640
00:17:20,804 --> 00:17:22,105
ALL PANICKY, THINKING,

641
00:17:22,105 --> 00:17:23,039
"SO MANY GLANDS,

642
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:23,974
SO LITTLE TIME."

643
00:17:23,974 --> 00:17:25,108
AND I'M TELLING YOU,

644
00:17:25,108 --> 00:17:26,409
JUST BE PATIENT.

645
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:27,611
EVERY GLAND WILL GET ITS TURN

646
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:28,845
EVENTUALLY.

647
00:17:28,845 --> 00:17:30,914
WHY BE IN A HURRY FOR A TRUS?

648
00:17:33,116 --> 00:17:34,117
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH THE

649
00:17:34,117 --> 00:17:35,218
EXCITING CONCLUSION OF

650
00:17:35,218 --> 00:17:36,820
THE STORY ABOUT THE ALIENS.

651
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,622
>> I'LL RECALIBRATE MY PHASER,

652
00:17:38,622 --> 00:17:40,624
JUST TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE.

653
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,167
>> HAROLD, I WANT YOU TO THINK

654
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:52,202
ABOUT TRYING SOMETHING

655
00:17:52,202 --> 00:17:54,271
THIS YEAR IN THE WINTER:

656
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:55,572
CAMPING.

657
00:17:55,572 --> 00:17:56,239
HUH? WE GO OUT.

658
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:57,107
WE JUST GET A TENT THERE,

659
00:17:57,107 --> 00:17:57,874
AND WE GO OUT

660
00:17:57,874 --> 00:18:00,443
IN 50, 60 BELOW ZERO.

661
00:18:00,443 --> 00:18:01,645
>> BUT DON'T THE PEGS FALL DOWN

662
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:02,612
IN THE SNOW?

663
00:18:02,612 --> 00:18:04,481
>> NO, YOU DON'T NEED PEGS.

664
00:18:04,481 --> 00:18:05,181
>> NO?

665
00:18:05,181 --> 00:18:06,049
>> NO, THE TENT, YOU PUT THE

666
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:07,017
TENT UP, AND IT JUST FREEZES

667
00:18:07,017 --> 00:18:08,318
THE WAY IT IS.

668
00:18:08,318 --> 00:18:09,853
>> OH, IT'S CERTAINLY

669
00:18:09,853 --> 00:18:11,021
AN INTERESTING INVITATION.

670
00:18:11,021 --> 00:18:11,855
>> WELL, HAROLD, IT'S AN

671
00:18:11,855 --> 00:18:13,123
EXPERIENCE YOU WON'T BELIEVE.

672
00:18:13,123 --> 00:18:13,790
>> HAVE YOU DONE THIS

673
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,524
EVER BEFORE?

674
00:18:14,524 --> 00:18:15,425
>> WELL, YEAH, YEAH,

675
00:18:15,425 --> 00:18:16,126
I'VE SEEN IT.

676
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:16,826
>> YOU'VE SEEN IT?

677
00:18:16,826 --> 00:18:17,494
>> YEAH.

678
00:18:17,494 --> 00:18:18,228
I SAW IT.

679
00:18:18,228 --> 00:18:18,895
>> LIKE THE IGLOOS?

680
00:18:18,895 --> 00:18:19,829
'CAUSE I WOULD GO IN AN IGLOO,

681
00:18:19,829 --> 00:18:20,497
BUT...

682

>> NO.

683
00:18:21,164 --> 00:18:21,831
NO, YOU DON'T WANT TO GO

684
00:18:21,831 --> 00:18:22,499
IN AN IGLOO.

685
00:18:22,499 --> 00:18:23,400
'CAUSE THEN YOU WAKE UP

686
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,200
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

687
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,402
YOU START CHEWING BLUBBER.

688
00:18:25,402 --> 00:18:27,771
>> OH, THAT'D BE HORRIBLE,

689
00:18:27,771 --> 00:18:28,672
'CAUSE I COULD BARELY REACH

690
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:29,973
MY STOMACH.

691
00:18:29,973 --> 00:18:31,241
>> OH, IT'S CLOSER

692
00:18:31,241 --> 00:18:34,210
THAN YOU THINK.

693
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:34,911
>> IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE

694
00:18:34,911 --> 00:18:35,979
A TWO-MAN TENT, DOES IT?

695
00:18:35,979 --> 00:18:36,780
>> NO, IT'S BETTER

696
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,181
IF IT'S A ONE-MAN TENT.

697
00:18:38,181 --> 00:18:39,082
>> FOR THE BOTH OF US?

698
00:18:39,082 --> 00:18:39,783
>> YEAH.

699
00:18:39,783 --> 00:18:40,450
WELL, I MEAN, TO KEEP

700
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,451
THE HEAT IN.

701
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:42,252
>> I DON'T KNOW.

702
00:18:42,252 --> 00:18:43,086
I'LL REALLY HAVE TO THINK

703
00:18:43,086 --> 00:18:43,753
ABOUT THIS.

704
00:18:43,753 --> 00:18:44,521
>> WELL, I'D LIKE YOU

705
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:45,188
JUST TO THINK ABOUT IT.

706
00:18:45,188 --> 00:18:46,089
I'M NOT ASKING FOR A COMMITMENT.

707
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:47,123
I'M JUST SAYING THAT, YOU KNOW,

708
00:18:47,123 --> 00:18:49,259
PICTURE YOURSELF, MID-JANUARY.

709
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:50,326
>> I'M A MAN OF THE '90s.

710
00:18:50,326 --> 00:18:51,828
COMMITMENT'S HARD.

711
00:18:51,828 --> 00:18:53,797
>> OH.

712
00:18:55,064 --> 00:18:56,232
JACK!

713
00:18:56,232 --> 00:18:58,835
JACK, COME ON UP HERE.

714
00:18:58,835 --> 00:19:01,237
I KNOW YOU'RE DOWN THERE, JACK.

715
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,375
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT?

716
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,177
IF YOU'RE FIGURING ON TRYING

717
00:19:07,177 --> 00:19:08,278
TO TAKE AWAY MY CAVE AND ALL MY

718
00:19:08,278 --> 00:19:09,979
SUPPLIES, WELL, THINK AGAIN,

719
00:19:09,979 --> 00:19:11,147
BECAUSE IT'S MINE.

720
00:19:11,147 --> 00:19:12,949
I HAVE A RECEIPT.

721
00:19:12,949 --> 00:19:13,783
>> NO, NO, NO, NO.

722
00:19:13,783 --> 00:19:15,084
IT'S JUST THE GUYS AT THE LODGE

723
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:15,952
WERE, YOU KNOW,

724
00:19:15,952 --> 00:19:16,920
WORRIED ABOUT YOU, AND

725
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,188
YOUR WIFE IS WORRIED ABOUT YOU,

726
00:19:18,188 --> 00:19:20,023
AND YOUR FRIENDS.

727
00:19:20,023 --> 00:19:21,357
WELL, NO, BUT AT LEAST YOUR WIFE

728
00:19:21,357 --> 00:19:24,527
IS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

729
00:19:24,527 --> 00:19:25,829
>> DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME, RED.

730
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:27,263
I'M LIKE A WILDCAT, YOU KNOW?

731
00:19:27,263 --> 00:19:29,799
I HAVE A--A FIFTH SENSE.

732
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:31,601
AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.

733
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:36,206
POLLUTION, TERRORISM, LAWYERS,

734
00:19:36,206 --> 00:19:37,907
IT'S ALL BREAKING DOWN, RED.

735
00:19:37,907 --> 00:19:38,608
OH, YEAH.

736
00:19:38,608 --> 00:19:39,809
AND WHILE THE REST OF THE WORLD

737
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:41,244
IS SINKING IN ITS OWN FILTH AND

738
00:19:41,244 --> 00:19:43,012
DECAY, I'M GONNA BE RIGHT HERE

739
00:19:43,012 --> 00:19:43,680

YOU OKAY?

00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:51,688
OH, MY BACK.

STUPID BANANA PEELS.

00:19:57,093 --> 00:19:58,861
YOU OKAY DOWN THERE?

750
00:19:58,861 --> 00:20:00,663
>> I'M FINE.

751
00:20:00,663 --> 00:20:01,631
SO DON'T MESS WITH ME,

752
00:20:01,631 --> 00:20:03,466
OR I'LL MESS WITH YOU.

[yells]

754
00:20:05,034 --> 00:20:06,035
OH!

>> JACK!

756
00:20:06,736 --> 00:20:08,304
JACK, YOU OKAY?

757
00:20:08,304 --> 00:20:11,541
>> NO PROBLEM.

758
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,543
OH!

759
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:15,078
I'M FINE.

760
00:20:15,078 --> 00:20:19,615
SO, RED, WHAT'S NEW?

761
00:20:19,615 --> 00:20:21,217
>> WELL, THE GUYS AT THE LODGE

762
00:20:21,217 --> 00:20:22,418
ARE, YOU KNOW, WORRIED THAT YOU

763
00:20:22,418 --> 00:20:23,319
WERE GETTING ENOUGH TO EAT.

764
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,821
THAT'S ALL.

765
00:20:24,821 --> 00:20:26,055
>> WELL, MY--

766
00:20:26,055 --> 00:20:27,790
MY SEEDS CAME, RED.

767
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,693
AND MY CANNED FOOD ARRIVED.

768
00:20:30,693 --> 00:20:33,396
OH, OH!

769
00:20:33,396 --> 00:20:34,630
I HAVE ENOUGH CANNED FOOD HERE

770
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,265
TO SURVIVE FOR YEARS,

771
00:20:36,265 --> 00:20:37,934
STACKS AND STACKS.

772
00:20:37,934 --> 00:20:38,868
BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY!

773
00:20:38,868 --> 00:20:41,137
IT'S ALL FOR ME.

774
00:20:41,137 --> 00:20:41,838
AND WHEN I WANT

775
00:20:41,838 --> 00:20:43,172
SOMETHING TO EAT,

776
00:20:43,172 --> 00:20:44,107
I JUST REACH OVER

777
00:20:44,107 --> 00:20:46,342
TO MY BIG STACK OF CANS

778
00:20:46,342 --> 00:20:47,376
AND PULL OUT SOME CANNED

779
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:48,778
GOOSEBERRIES LIKE THIS

780
00:20:48,778 --> 00:20:50,546
OR--OR SOME FRUIT COCKTAIL

781
00:20:50,546 --> 00:20:51,447
HERE--

782
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:52,815

>> OW, OW, OW.

786
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:02,825
AND THEN I EAT IT.

787
00:21:02,825 --> 00:21:05,428
WELL, RED, I'D LOVE TO VISIT,

788
00:21:05,428 --> 00:21:06,629
BUT--

789
00:21:06,629 --> 00:21:08,097
[groans]

790
00:21:08,097 --> 00:21:11,801
I HAVE TO PRACTICE MY YOGA.

791
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:13,603
>> YEAH, WELL, OKAY, MAYBE WE'LL

792
00:21:13,603 --> 00:21:14,604
COME BACK LATER WHEN YOU'RE

793
00:21:14,604 --> 00:21:15,938
FEELING BETTER, YOU KNOW.

794
00:21:15,938 --> 00:21:18,007
>> YEAH, YEAH.

795
00:21:18,007 --> 00:21:20,643
I'M--I'M FINE.

796
00:21:20,643 --> 00:21:21,544
>> ALL RIGHT.

797
00:21:21,544 --> 00:21:24,347
>> I FEEL WARM, AND EVERYTHING

798
00:21:24,347 --> 00:21:29,151
IS PEACEFUL AND TINGLY.

799
00:21:29,151 --> 00:21:29,986
>> WELL, I DON'T WANT TO BOTHER

800
00:21:29,986 --> 00:21:31,153
YOU WHILE YOU'RE MEDITATING,

801
00:21:31,153 --> 00:21:32,788
YOU KNOW.

802
00:21:32,788 --> 00:21:34,757
>> [groans]

803
00:21:42,365 --> 00:21:43,699
>> SO ANYWAY, THE BUNCH OF US,

804
00:21:43,699 --> 00:21:45,534
AS I SAY, WERE SKINNY-DIPPING.

805
00:21:45,534 --> 00:21:47,870
AND WE SAW THIS UFO THING.

806
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,605
AND IT CAME DOWN, AND IT WAS

807
00:21:49,605 --> 00:21:50,773
JUST LIKE OUT OF THE MOVIE

808
00:21:50,773 --> 00:21:52,742
E.T., EXCEPT IT WAS SMALLER

809
00:21:52,742 --> 00:21:53,409
AND IT DIDN'T HAVE

810
00:21:53,409 --> 00:21:54,810
THAT GREAT SONG.

811
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,112
BUT IT LANDED IN THE WOODS

812
00:21:56,112 --> 00:21:57,146
JUST BEHIND THE LODGE.

813
00:21:57,146 --> 00:21:57,847
SO WE JUST WENT

814
00:21:57,847 --> 00:21:58,614
RIGHT OVER THERE.

815
00:21:58,614 --> 00:21:59,782
WE DIDN'T EVEN STOP TO,

816
00:21:59,782 --> 00:22:00,483
YOU KNOW,

817
00:22:00,483 --> 00:22:01,217
GET DRESSED OR ANYTHING,

818
00:22:01,217 --> 00:22:02,151
'CAUSE WE THOUGHT, WELL,

819
00:22:02,151 --> 00:22:03,419
YOU KNOW, MAYBE THEY WOULD BE

820
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:04,754
INTIMIDATED BY CLOTHING

821
00:22:04,754 --> 00:22:06,489
OR POSSIBLY ALLERGIC TO IT.

822
00:22:06,489 --> 00:22:08,024
SO ANYWAY, WE JUST--BUCK NAKED,

823
00:22:08,024 --> 00:22:09,659
THE BUNCH OF US, JUST WHIPPED

824
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:10,893
OVER THERE, YOU KNOW?

825
00:22:10,893 --> 00:22:12,895
AND WE ALSO TOOK A GIFT:

826
00:22:12,895 --> 00:22:14,030
BEER.

827
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,364
AND WE SHOWED THEM

828
00:22:15,364 --> 00:22:16,766
HOW TO DRINK IT.

829
00:22:16,766 --> 00:22:19,802
AND THEN THEY JUST STARTED

830
00:22:19,802 --> 00:22:20,636
TO LEAVE.

831
00:22:20,636 --> 00:22:22,138
THEY GOT UP, AND EVERYTHING--

832
00:22:22,138 --> 00:22:22,838
AND WE FOLLOWED THEM.

833
00:22:22,838 --> 00:22:23,539
WE CHASED THEM

834
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:25,074
ALL THROUGH THE FOREST

835
00:22:25,074 --> 00:22:26,242
AND EVEN ACTUALLY UP

836
00:22:26,242 --> 00:22:27,243
ONTO THE MAIN HIGHWAY.

837
00:22:27,243 --> 00:22:29,178
AND WE'RE RUNNING DOWN THERE.

838
00:22:29,178 --> 00:22:30,479
AND THE FEET ON THE ASPHALT

839
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:31,414
IS NOT A FUN THING.

840
00:22:31,414 --> 00:22:32,915
AND JUST AS WE GOT CLOSE

841
00:22:32,915 --> 00:22:34,717
TO THEM, THEY KIND OF

842
00:22:34,717 --> 00:22:36,452
SHIMMERED OUT OF EXISTENCE.

843
00:22:36,452 --> 00:22:38,921
AND THE SPACESHIP JUST ROSE

844
00:22:38,921 --> 00:22:41,190
SILENTLY INTO THE NIGHT SKY.

845
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,291
AND THAT'S HOW COME

846
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:45,561
THE SIX OF US ENDED UP DRUNK

847
00:22:45,561 --> 00:22:46,762
AND STARK NAKED IN THE MIDDLE

848
00:22:46,762 --> 00:22:48,264
OF THE MAIN HIGHWAY.

849
00:22:48,264 --> 00:22:50,166
AND YOU ASK ANY ONE OF THE BUNCH

850
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:51,200
OF US, AND YOU'LL GET EXACTLY

851
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,002
THE SAME STORY, WORD FOR WORD.

852
00:22:53,002 --> 00:22:55,704
ANYWAY, MY WIFE IS WATCHING.

853
00:22:55,704 --> 00:22:56,705
I'LL BE HOME JUST AS SOON
