43
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,064
AND THEIR MONEY IS LIKE

00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:40,533
REAL MONEY TOO.

45
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:41,467
WE CAN MAKE A FORTUNE JUST

46
00:01:41,467 --> 00:01:42,802
ON BOAT GAS BECAUSE THEY USE

47
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:43,936
GALLONS THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW

48
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:47,140

AND PENCILS? NO, PAMPHLETS

64
00:02:08,594 --> 00:02:10,563
IT'S PROMOTION, PROMOTION

65
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:12,265
YOU GOT TO SEE THAT.

66

>>RED: HAROLD YOU WILL

67
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:17,637
PERSONALLY NEVER SEE PROMOTION.

68
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,005

69
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,339

75
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,015
MIGHT BE A BETTER GIMMICK.

76
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,550
>>RED: OH NO WAY HAROLD, NO WAY

77
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,251
PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT THAT

00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:33,973
IS YOU TAKE YOUR VEHICLE DOWN

153
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,275

154
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:37,243

00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:50,222
3 TIRES 1..2..3...

158
00:04:50,222 --> 00:04:51,390
NOW ON THE OFF CHANCE THAT

159
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,324
YOU ACTUALLY HAVE SOME TREAD

160
00:04:52,324 --> 00:04:53,592
ON YOUR TIRES YOU MIGHT WANT

161
00:04:53,592 --> 00:04:55,628
TO CLEAN THEM OUT THERE BECAUSE

162
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,896
NOTHING WILL RUIN A RELAXING

163
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,864
EVENING MORE THAN HAVING MAYBE

164
00:04:58,864 --> 00:05:01,233
A BIT OF ROAD KILL OR DOG DIRT

165
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:02,234
IN THERE ESPECIALLY IF IT'S ON

166
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:03,769
THE SIDE CLOSEST TO THE FIRE.

167
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:04,770
SO JUST GET IN THERE AND

168
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,804
CLEAN THAT OUT REAL GOOD,

169
00:05:05,804 --> 00:05:08,907
A TOOTHBRUSH WORKS REAL WELL.

170
00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:10,943
AND WHEN YOU'RE DONE YOU MIGHT

171
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:12,044
WANT TO CLEAN THAT OUT REAL

172
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:12,978
GOOD BEFORE YOU PUT IT BACK

173
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:14,580
INTO OLD MAN SEDGEWICK'S

174
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,782
DENTURE CUP.

175
00:05:16,782 --> 00:05:17,950
(GLASS SHATTERING)

176
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,284
ALL RIGHT THIS BECOMES YOUR SEAT

177
00:05:19,284 --> 00:05:20,552
RIGHT HERE IF YOU GOT THE

178
00:05:20,552 --> 00:05:21,720
HEMORRHOIDS OR ANYTHING YOU

179
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,921
MIGHT WANT TO GO WITH A SOFT

180
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:24,657
WALL RADIAL AND YOU TRY

181
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,291
AND FIND YOURSELF A PAIL

182
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,393
THAT'S THE SAME DIAMETER

183
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,361
AS THE INSIDE DIAMETER OF

184
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:31,664
THE TIRES YOU JUST POP

185
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,631
THAT RIGHT IN THERE.

186
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:36,035
NOW YOU GOT A BUCKET SEAT.

187
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,236
NOW WHAT THIS BECOMES IS YOUR

188
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:38,537
COMPARTMENT FOR HOLDING SNACKS

189
00:05:38,537 --> 00:05:39,605
OR YOUR FAVOURITE BEVERAGES

190
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:40,572
OR WHATEVER BECAUSE NOTHING

191
00:05:40,572 --> 00:05:41,807
IS MORE IRRITATING THAN

192
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:42,775
TRYING TO WATCH TV AND HAVING

193
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:43,976
TO GET UP EVERY 3 HOURS

194
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,611
TO GO TO THE FRIDGE.

195
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:46,979
OF COURSE THIS SERVES AN

196
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,047
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PURPOSE

197
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,381
DURING FLU SEASON.

198
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:50,516
ALL RIGHT YOU NEED A COUPLE

199
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:54,286
MORE TIRES THAT BECOME THE ARMS

200
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:55,521
OF YOUR CHAIR, YOU CAN MAKE

201
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,789
THESE AS DECORATIVE AS YOU LIKE

202
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:59,525
YOU CAN PUT THE STUDS ON THERE

203
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,692
OR THE CHAINS YOU COULD EVEN

204
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:01,693
GO HOLLYWOOD YOU KNOW HOW

205
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:02,761
THE HOLLYWOOD STYLE WHERE

206
00:06:02,761 --> 00:06:03,962
THEY GET THEIR NAME CARVED

207
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:05,798
IN THE SIDEWALK AND EVERYTHING

208
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:06,865
WELL YOU COULD HAVE A NAME RIGHT

209
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:07,933
INSIDE YOUR TIRE AS LONG AS

210
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:10,602
YOUR NAME IS B.F. GOODRICH.

211
00:06:10,602 --> 00:06:11,837
OF COURSE NOTHING SAYS

212
00:06:11,837 --> 00:06:14,740
MONEY LIKE HUBCAPS

213
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,208
ESPECIALLY IF YOU CAN GET

214
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,209
THOSE SIMULATED SPOKE JOBS

215
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:20,679
GOD THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL

216
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:21,613
AREN'T THEY?

217
00:06:21,613 --> 00:06:22,447
YOU POP THEM IN THERE

218
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:23,348
AND DON'T WORRY IF YOU HAVE

219
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:24,383
A LITTLE ROTTEN HUBCAPS

220
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,517
BECAUSE ANTIQUE FURNITURE

221
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:27,819
IS ACTUALLY WORTH MORE.

222
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:29,021
ALL RIGHT NOW WE NEED

223
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:31,523
THE BACK OF OUR CHAIR THAT

224
00:06:31,523 --> 00:06:36,495
REQUIRES 2 TIRES, NOT THAT ONE.

225
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:38,564
(CRASHING & BANGING)

226
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,933
ALL RIGHT THESE 2 WILL BE FINE

227
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:43,769
WHAT WE DO IS WE PUT THEM END

228
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:44,736
TO END AND WE GOT TO ATTACH

229
00:06:44,736 --> 00:06:45,804
THEM TO EACH OTHER

230
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:46,905
AND WE GOT TO ATTACH THEM

231
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:47,839
TO THE ARMS AND TO

232
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:48,674
THE CHAIR ITSELF.

233
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:49,575
NOW WHEN YOU ATTACH THEM

234
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,542
TOGETHER THERE YOU COULD DO

235
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:51,677
THAT WITH GLUE OR A STAPLE GUN

236
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:52,778
OR YOU COULD EVEN USE AN

237
00:06:52,778 --> 00:06:54,346
ACETYLENE TORCH BUT IT DOES

238
00:06:54,346 --> 00:06:55,681
TEND TO STINK TO A CERTAIN

239
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,149
EXTENT, SO I RECOMMEND THE

240
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:59,184
HANDYMAN'S SECRET WEAPON,

241
00:06:59,184 --> 00:07:02,220
DUCT TAPE.

242
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,622
AND GET THAT TAPE NICE AND

243
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:05,190
SMOOTH ON THERE SMOOTH TAPE

244
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,893
IS A SIGN OF A FINE CRAFTSMAN.

245
00:07:07,893 --> 00:07:08,860
NOW I'VE MOUNTED MY PICTURE

246
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,761
IN THE BACK THERE JUST SO

247
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:11,096
EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS IS

248
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:12,497
MY CHAIR, YOU KNOW IN CASE

249
00:07:12,497 --> 00:07:14,933
B.F. GOODRICH EVER DROPS BY.

250
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:17,135
BUT YOU COULD PUT A BUMPER

251
00:07:17,135 --> 00:07:18,136
STICKER IN THERE OR A STEERING

252
00:07:18,136 --> 00:07:19,204
WHEEL OR EVEN ONE OF THOSE

253
00:07:19,204 --> 00:07:21,206
ROUND ITALIAN LOAFS.

254
00:07:21,206 --> 00:07:22,341
NOW THE REAL AMBITIOUS HANDYMAN

255
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,942
WOULD ALSO MAKE HIMSELF THIS

256
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:26,345
MATCHING SIDE TABLE HERE

257
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:28,347

260
00:07:30,182 --> 00:07:31,750
I DID THIS WITH A VOLVO

261
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,718
BECAUSE MY WIFE REALLY LIKE

262

SOMETHING TO EAT HUH?

TALKING THROUGH YOUR LAWYERS.

343
00:09:58,797 --> 00:09:59,931
>>RED: WELL I THINK IF OUR

344
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:01,266
VIEWERS LISTEN CLOSELY TO WHAT

345
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:03,101
BOB IS SAYING HERE THERE'S

346
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:04,302
A PRETTY GOOD CLUE IN THERE

00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:05,603
AS TO MAYBE HOW YOU CAN

348

353
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:13,912
I MEAN BETWEEN THIS GUY AND ME

354
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:15,013
WE'VE MET 6 WOMEN WHO FALL

355
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:18,583
INTO THAT CATEGORY.

356
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:20,685
>>RED: IT IS AUTUMN

357
00:10:20,685 --> 00:10:21,886
THE LAKE WILL SOON FREEZE

358
00:10:21,886 --> 00:10:23,187
HARD AS A ROCK

359
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:25,223
SO GET THE BOATS UP ON THE DOCK

360
00:10:25,223 --> 00:10:27,091

HAP IS THIS BOAT STRONG

370
00:10:50,648 --> 00:10:52,050

371
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,217
DO YOU THINK?

372
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:54,218
>>HAP: THIS BOAT WILL

373
00:10:54,218 --> 00:10:55,787
DO ANYTHING FOR A FEE.

374
00:10:55,787 --> 00:10:57,355
>>RED: WILL IT RUN RELIABLY?

375
00:10:57,355 --> 00:10:58,323
>>HAP: I'M NOT SURE

376
00:10:58,323 --> 00:11:00,625
YOU HAVE THAT MUCH MONEY.

377
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:01,693
OLD MAN SEDGEWICK SAID SOMETHING

378
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:03,561

379
00:11:03,561 --> 00:11:04,562
>>RED: YEAH WELL THAT'S WHAT

I MEAN WATER SKIERS

385
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:12,837
WHY DON'T I WRESTLE A SHARK

386
00:11:12,837 --> 00:11:13,971
THAT'S ALWAYS A GOOD

387
00:11:13,971 --> 00:11:14,839
CROWD PLEASER.

YOU KNOW ME AGAINST A GREAT

389
00:11:16,507 --> 00:11:17,508
WHITE SHARK YOU COULD CALL IT

390
00:11:17,508 --> 00:11:18,776
THE FEARLESS FISHERMAN.

391
00:11:18,776 --> 00:11:19,644
>>RED: YEAH OR

393
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:22,413
>>HAP: I'M USED TO SHARKS,

394
00:11:22,413 --> 00:11:23,548
I LIKE SHARKS.

395
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:24,449
>>RED: OH SURE BUT

396
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:26,884
THEY'LL SWALLOW ANYTHING.

397
00:11:26,884 --> 00:11:28,119
YOU KNOW HAP I DON'T THINK

398
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:29,554
SHARKS CAN SURVIVE FRESH WATER

399
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:30,955
NOT THAT POSSUM LAKE

400
00:11:30,955 --> 00:11:32,723
IS ALL THAT FRESH.

401
00:11:32,723 --> 00:11:34,125
>>HAP: TOO BAD, JACQUES COUSTEAU

THE GREAT WHITE HUNTER

409
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:46,737
AGAINST THE GREAT WHITE WHALE.

410
00:11:46,737 --> 00:11:48,272
OH NO WAIT WHALES ARE SALT

411
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:50,107
WATER CREATURES TOO.

412
00:11:50,107 --> 00:11:51,309
>>RED: IF YOU COULD JUST

413
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:53,044
PULL THE WATER SKIERS.

414

00:11:58,049 --> 00:11:59,584
THAT STORY RED?

419
00:11:59,584 --> 00:12:00,918
>>RED: IT HASN'T BEEN NECESSARY

420
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:01,919
AND BESIDES WE DON'T HAVE

421
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,121

CROWD AND T-BONED

440
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:40,891

HAVE THAT IN EVERY SHOW

447
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:56,807
AS THE BIG FINALE

448
00:12:56,807 --> 00:12:57,775
SO A BUNCH OF THE GUYS

449
00:12:57,775 --> 00:13:00,444

>>HAROLD: UNCLE RED THAT'S

451
00:13:01,445 --> 00:13:03,147
NOT HOW A WATER SHOW WORKS

452
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:03,981
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A

453
00:13:03,981 --> 00:13:05,249
DEMONSTRATION OF STYLE

454
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:07,585
AND GRACE AND ATHLETIC ABILITIES

455
00:13:07,585 --> 00:13:08,619
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE GO TO

456
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:09,754
CYPRESS GARDENS TO SEE

457
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:11,422
A DEMOLITION DERBY.

458
00:13:11,422 --> 00:13:12,990
>>RED: WELL WE'RE PUSHING

TO SLALOM SKI ON ONE SKI

464
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:23,033

465
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:24,401
HAVE ONE SKI AND A BUNCH

466
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:25,970

467
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:26,904
A FORMATION WHILE BEING

468
00:13:26,904 --> 00:13:28,005
TOWED AROUND THE LAKE

469
00:13:28,005 --> 00:13:30,007

00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:32,977

>>RED: WELL NO, THE VERSION

474
00:13:34,011 --> 00:13:35,412

STONEHENGE AND MOOSE THOMPSON

476
00:13:39,483 --> 00:13:40,718
IS REAL KEEN TO DO SOMETHING

477
00:13:40,718 --> 00:13:41,752
BUT IF WE GET WATER SKIS

478
00:13:41,752 --> 00:13:43,220
LONG ENOUGH TO SUIT HIS

479
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,188
BODY WEIGHT WE'LL HAVE

480
00:13:44,188 --> 00:13:46,657
TO MOVE TO A BIGGER LAKE.

481
00:13:46,657 --> 00:13:47,658
>>HAROLD: WELL MAYBE HE COULD

482
00:13:47,658 --> 00:13:48,459
JUST LIKE BODY SURF

483

00:14:36,874 --> 00:14:38,042
IN THE WOODS MINDING MY OWN

507
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:40,477
BUSINESS NOT BOTHERING ANYBODY

508
00:14:40,477 --> 00:14:41,912
FORGETTING THAT IT WAS TIME FOR

509
00:14:41,912 --> 00:14:44,782
'ADVENTURES WITH BILL'.

510
00:14:44,782 --> 00:14:46,483
BILL IS DRESSED A LITTLE

511
00:14:46,483 --> 00:14:48,085
UNUSUALLY I FELT FOR THE WEATHER

512
00:14:48,085 --> 00:14:50,521
BUT KIND OF ONE OF THEM WETSUIT

513
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:52,156
STARTLING IDEAS RIGHT THERE AND

514
00:14:52,156 --> 00:14:54,692
I'M NOT COMPLETELY SURE HE HAD

515
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:55,693
THE HEAD GEAR ON ABSOLUTELY

516
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:57,461
THE WAY THEY WOULD RECOMMEND

517
00:14:57,461 --> 00:14:58,595
DOWN AT THE SNORKELING PLACE

518
00:14:58,595 --> 00:14:59,797
BUT I COULD UNDERSTAND THEM

519
00:14:59,797 --> 00:15:01,298
NOT WANTING TO TALK TO BILL.

520
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:03,300
NOW HE'S CHECKING THE WATER

521
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,401
TEMPERATURE, POSSUM LAKE IS

522
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:07,037
VERY VERY COLD VERY EARLY

523
00:15:07,037 --> 00:15:08,005
ANY TIME FROM JULY 15TH ON

524
00:15:08,005 --> 00:15:09,306
BY GOLLY SHE'S REAL COLD THERE

525
00:15:09,306 --> 00:15:10,574
SO HE FROZE HIS FINGER RIGHT

526
00:15:10,574 --> 00:15:11,608
IN THERE BUT I'M ONLY TOO

527
00:15:11,608 --> 00:15:12,843
WILLING TO HELP HIM OUT ON THAT

528
00:15:12,843 --> 00:15:14,745
(LOUD THUD OF ROCK HITTING ICE)

529
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:15,712
THERE YOU GO.

530
00:15:15,712 --> 00:15:16,613
>>BILL: AAHHH!

531
00:15:16,613 --> 00:15:19,983
>>RED: OH OH WON'T BE ABLE

532
00:15:19,983 --> 00:15:21,652
TO HITCHHIKE UNTIL I FIX THAT

533
00:15:21,652 --> 00:15:22,786
NO PROBLEM BILL AND NOW HE'S

534
00:15:22,786 --> 00:15:23,687
GOT THIS LITTLE BAG TO CATCH

535
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:24,655
ALL HIS TREASURES IN WHEN

536
00:15:24,655 --> 00:15:25,756
HE DIVES, SEE HE PUTS THEM IN

537
00:15:25,756 --> 00:15:27,124
THE BAG THAT'S GOT LIKE THE MESH

538
00:15:27,124 --> 00:15:28,358
AND THE WATER GOES OUT AND THE

539
00:15:28,358 --> 00:15:31,094
TREASURES STAY IN AND HE'S

540
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:31,795
JUST GOING TO GET READY.

541
00:15:31,795 --> 00:15:32,729
I THINK YOU HAVE TO

542
00:15:32,729 --> 00:15:33,697
CLEAN OFF THE MASK

543
00:15:33,697 --> 00:15:35,499
AND HE'S GOT HIS FACE IN THE

544
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:38,001
BASIN AND YOU KNOW A LOT

545
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:38,836
OF GUYS WHEN THEIR FINGER

546
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:39,636
FROZE, YEAH EXACTLY.

547
00:15:39,636 --> 00:15:41,205
WELL WHAT DID YOU EXPECT BILL?

548
00:15:41,205 --> 00:15:43,173
BUT LUCKILY THE SAME SOLUTION

549
00:15:43,173 --> 00:15:44,041
WILL WORK ON A FACE THAT WORKS

550
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,042
ON A FINGER BECAUSE WHAT I DID

551
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:47,144
WAS I PICKED A BIGGER ROCK

552
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:48,912
WHAT I CALL A FACE SIZED ROCK

553
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:52,749
STAY STILL, STAY STILL.

554
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:53,584
THERE HE GOES GETTING

555
00:15:53,584 --> 00:15:55,485
THE ICE OUT OF THERE,

556
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:57,821
YEAH YOU'RE ALL RIGHT

557
00:15:57,821 --> 00:15:58,722
YOU'RE FINE, YOU'RE FINE.

558
00:15:58,722 --> 00:15:59,590
YEAH NOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING

559
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,757
AT THIS POINT WAS BILL HAD

560
00:16:00,757 --> 00:16:01,758
HAD HIS PLAN BUT HE WAS

561
00:16:01,758 --> 00:16:03,160
STARTING TO ADAPT AS TO WHAT

562
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,896
EXACTLY HE WAS SAYING TO HIMSELF

563
00:16:05,896 --> 00:16:07,264
BOY DO I REALLY WANT

564
00:16:07,264 --> 00:16:08,398
TO GO INTO THAT?

565
00:16:08,398 --> 00:16:11,335
AND I'M THINKING TO MYSELF NO!

566
00:16:11,335 --> 00:16:12,502
NOW I WOULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED

567
00:16:12,502 --> 00:16:13,370
WHAT BILL WAS GOING TO DO

568
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:16,239
AS AN ALTERNATIVE.

569
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:17,040
HE HANDED ME HIS GLASSES

570
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,609
PUTS ON THE MASK

571
00:16:18,609 --> 00:16:19,476
NOW THERE'S NO WATER AROUND

572
00:16:19,476 --> 00:16:21,011
BUT HE DIVES, BELIEVE IT OR NOT

573
00:16:21,011 --> 00:16:25,148
FOLKS INTO THE LEAVES.

574
00:16:25,148 --> 00:16:26,283
ONCE IN A WHILE BILL GOES

575
00:16:26,283 --> 00:16:27,217
OVER THAT LINE AND I REALLY

576
00:16:27,217 --> 00:16:28,385
DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND

577
00:16:28,385 --> 00:16:30,220
WHAT'S GOING ON.

578
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,055
STRANGE NOISES I FEEL LIKE

579
00:16:32,055 --> 00:16:33,090
I'M ONE OF THE EXTRAS ON

580
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,692
'SEA HUNT' AT THIS POINT.

581
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:37,027
AND I SAW A BIT OF MOVEMENT

582
00:16:37,027 --> 00:16:37,995
THERE YOU CAN'T REALLY

583
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:39,062
LOOK FOR THE BUBBLES

584
00:16:39,062 --> 00:16:40,197
COMING UP.

585
00:16:40,197 --> 00:16:43,033
NOT WITH BILL AND OF COURSE

586
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:44,968
YOU DON'T WANT TO LOOK FOR

587
00:16:44,968 --> 00:16:45,869
THE BUBBLES COMING UP.

588
00:16:45,869 --> 00:16:47,104
THERE HE IS! THERE HE IS!

589
00:16:47,104 --> 00:16:48,271

AND DOWN HE GOES AGAIN

594
00:16:53,443 --> 00:16:54,845

YOU'LL NEVER HAVE

674
00:19:17,453 --> 00:19:23,126
TO WORRY ABOUT.

675
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:26,262
(LOUD CRASHING)

00:19:26,262 --> 00:19:27,564

TEENAGERS OF TODAY YOU KNOW

679
00:19:34,571 --> 00:19:35,972
HANGING OUT AT THE VIDEO ARCADE

680
00:19:35,972 --> 00:19:36,673
OR DRIVING AROUND IN ONE OF

THEM 4-WHEEL STEREOS

682
00:19:38,775 --> 00:19:39,876
I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT

683
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:40,743
YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON A BIG

684
00:19:40,743 --> 00:19:42,178
PART OF TEENAGE LIFE AND THAT

685
00:19:42,178 --> 00:19:43,546
IS HAVING A DARNED INTERESTING

686
00:19:43,546 --> 00:19:45,081
HOBBY, HUNTING OR FISHING,

687
00:19:45,081 --> 00:19:47,050
OR CAMPING OR HIKING OR

688
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,985
WHITTLING OR THAT KIND OF THING.

689
00:19:48,985 --> 00:19:50,286
YOU KNOW A HOBBY IS AN IMPORTANT

690
00:19:50,286 --> 00:19:51,521
PART OF YOUR DEVELOPMENT

691
00:19:51,521 --> 00:19:52,555
AND IT HELPS FILL IN THE TIME

692
00:19:52,555 --> 00:19:53,690
WHILE YOU'RE WAITING TO TURN

693
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,091
INTO SOMETHING WORTHWHILE.

694
00:19:55,091 --> 00:19:56,292
AND MAKE SURE YOU PICK A REAL

695
00:19:56,292 --> 00:19:57,393
ONE YOU KNOW SKIPPING STONES

696
00:19:57,393 --> 00:19:58,561
ACROSS STORE WINDOWS

697
00:19:58,561 --> 00:20:00,096
AT THE MALL IS NOT A HOBBY

698
00:20:00,096 --> 00:20:02,532
AND NEITHER IS AUTO THEFT.

699
00:20:02,532 --> 00:20:04,000
AND YOU MAY THINK GETTING ALONG

700
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,368
WITH GIRLS IS A HOBBY NOW

701
00:20:05,368 --> 00:20:06,369
BUT AFTER YOU GET MARRIED THAT

702
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:08,037
TURNS INTO A JOB AND NOTHING

703
00:20:08,037 --> 00:20:09,272
KILLS A HOBBY FASTER THAN

704
00:20:09,272 --> 00:20:10,139
TURNING IT INTO A

705
00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:12,642
