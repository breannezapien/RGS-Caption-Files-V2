TO GET UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL

118
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,205
ABOUT YOUR PLUMBING OR I SHOULD

119
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,541
SAY YOUR HOUSE'S PLUMBING.

120
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,642
YOU KNOW THE WORD PLUMBING

121
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:30,876
ACTUALLY COMES FROM THE

122
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:32,345
ANCIENT ROMAN WORD FOR LEAD

123
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,714
WHICH WAS PLUM BUM, WHICH WAS

124
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,715
ACTUALLY HAROLD'S NICKNAME

125
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,849
FOR AWHILE.

126
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:37,983
NOW OF COURSE THE ANCIENT ROMANS

127
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:39,085
THEY USED LEAD FOR ALL

128
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,920
THEIR WATER PIPES,

129
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,855
THEY'RE ALL DEAD NOW.

130
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,390
NOW THERE'S 2 SIDES TO PLUMBING

131
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,558
REALLY, THERE'S SUPPLY AND

132
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,560
DEMAND OR DRAINAGE, DRAINAGE.

133
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,128
NOW THE DRAINAGE SIDE YOU GOT

134
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,396
THE BIG PIPES THERE AND YOU GOT

135
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,831
HOLES IN THE GROUND AND YOU

136
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:52,998
GOT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW,

137
00:03:52,998 --> 00:03:54,100
AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING,

138
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,201
PAYING $50 BUCKS TO A

139
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,335
PROFESSIONAL TO HANDLE THAT

140
00:03:56,335 --> 00:03:58,604
IS WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY.

141
00:03:58,604 --> 00:03:59,638
BUT NOW THE SUPPLY SIDE

142
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:00,606
THAT'S A DIFFERENT KETTLE

143
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:01,674
OF FISH ENTIRELY,

144
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:02,708
IT'S SO DARN EASY AN IDIOT

145
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,510
CAN DO IT AND I CAN PROVE IT.

146
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,945
NOW WHAT YOU WANT TO START

147
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,413
WITH IS COPPER PIPE, NOT LEAD,

148
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,981
AND YOU CAN GET IT ANY LENGTH

149
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:10,182
BUT WE KIND OF LIKE THE 12 FOOT

150
00:04:10,182 --> 00:04:14,120
LENGTHS BECAUSE WE GET

151
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,023
THE 12 FOOTERS BECAUSE

152
00:04:18,023 --> 00:04:23,362
(CRACKLING OF ELECTRICITY)

153
00:04:23,362 --> 00:04:24,163
WE JUST FIND THAT WITH THE

154
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:31,370
12 FOOTERS IT'S JUST EASIER

155
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,973
TO WORK WITH.

156
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,174
OKAY SO ONCE YOU'VE GOT

157
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,176
YOUR COPPER PIPE WHAT YOU WANT

158
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,078
IS TO GET SOME FITTINGS SO THAT

159
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,313
YOU CAN GO AROUND JOISTS AND

160
00:04:41,313 --> 00:04:43,282
BEAMS AND MAYBE PICTURES OR

161
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:44,583
WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU JUST

162
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,886
DON'T FEEL LIKE MOVING.

163
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:47,953
SO YOU GOT YOUR VARIOUS KINDS

164
00:04:47,953 --> 00:04:49,088
OF FITTINGS HERE, YOU GOT YOUR

165
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:50,723

00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:52,458
90 DEGREE WHICH COME IN LEFT

167
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,792
AND RIGHT, OF COURSE THEY

168
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:55,194
DON'T MARK THEM YOU KNOW,

169
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,362
SO WHAT I DO IS I JUST,

170
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:57,329
I BUY THEM BY THE BOX AND THEY

171
00:04:57,329 --> 00:04:59,798
GENERALLY WORK OUT AROUND 50/50

172
00:04:59,798 --> 00:05:02,668
AND YOU GOT THIS UNIT HERE

173
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:04,103
WHICH I GUESS WOULD BE

174
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:07,606
180 DEGREE ELBOW AND THIS ONE

175
00:05:07,606 --> 00:05:09,508
WHICH GOES RIGHT ON THE END

176
00:05:09,508 --> 00:05:11,910
OF THE PIPE WHICH IS A 360.

177
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,412
AND THEN YOU GOT YOUR T-JOINER

178
00:05:13,412 --> 00:05:15,414
FOR JOINING 2 PIPES TO ONE

179
00:05:15,414 --> 00:05:16,949
AND YOU GOT YOUR Y-JOINER FOR

180
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:17,883
ANY OF YOU WHO HAVE NOT

181
00:05:17,883 --> 00:05:20,552
YET JOINED THE 'Y',

182
00:05:20,552 --> 00:05:22,554
A LITTLE PLUMBING HUMOUR THERE.

183
00:05:22,554 --> 00:05:23,856
ALL RIGHT ONCE YOU'VE GOT YOUR

184
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:24,990
PIPE CUT UP INTO THE VARIOUS

185
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,492
LENGTHS THAT YOU NEED,

186
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,993
YOU GET THEM ALL TOGETHER AND

187
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:29,495
YOU GOT TO ROUGH UP THE ENDS

188
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,496
OF THE PIPES SO THAT THE SALDER

189
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,364
WILL STICK TO THEM,

190
00:05:32,364 --> 00:05:33,499
THIS ALMOST LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING

191
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,666
THAT ZANFEAR WOULD PLAY

192
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,168
DOESN'T IT?

193
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:37,302
ANYWAY WHEN IT COMES TO ROUGHING

194
00:05:37,302 --> 00:05:39,204
UP THE PIPE THERE'S AN EASY WAY

195
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:47,513
TO DO THAT USING THE BELT SANDER

196
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:51,817
JUST LIKE THAT.

197
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:52,818
OKAY NOW WE CAN ASSEMBLE

198
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:54,953
THE PIPING, WE TAKE THE ELBOWS

199
00:05:54,953 --> 00:05:57,189
AND YOU FILL THEM UP WITH GREASE

200
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:59,458
NOT ELBOW GREASE BUT THIS OTHER

201
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,493
STUFF, IT'S CALLED FLUX AND

202
00:06:01,493 --> 00:06:03,996
YOU STICK IT RIGHT ON THERE.

203
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:04,897
THIS IS GOING TO PROBABLY

204
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:05,931
TAKE ME A LITTLE WHILE TO

205
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:07,866
PUT TOGETHER, SO WHY DON'T WE

206
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:09,568
GET ON WITH THE SHOW AND WHEN

207
00:06:09,568 --> 00:06:14,406
I'M DONE WE'LL COME RIGHT BACK.

208
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:20,712
>>HAROLD: ONCE AGAIN IT'S THAT

209
00:06:20,712 --> 00:06:21,713
TIME OF THE SHOW WE EXPOSE

210
00:06:21,713 --> 00:06:22,447
THOSE 3 LITTLE WORDS THAT MEN

211
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:23,282
FIND SO DIFFICULT TO SAY,

212
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:25,984
'I DON'T KNOW'.

213
00:06:25,984 --> 00:06:26,952
AND HERE TO PROVE THAT POINT

214
00:06:26,952 --> 00:06:28,120
JUST ONE MORE TIME IS MY

215
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,255
UNCLE RED AND OF COURSE

216
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:40,399
MR. DOUGIE FRANKLIN.

217
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,233
WELL THIS WILL BE INTERESTING,

218
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:42,267
WE HAVE A LETTER FROM TEXAS

219
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:43,635
THIS WEEK, UNITED STATES.

220
00:06:43,635 --> 00:06:44,703
OH EXCELLENT, OKAY.

221
00:06:44,703 --> 00:06:46,505
'DEAR EXPERTS, LAST YEAR

222
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:47,940
THE MISSUS AND I VACATIONED

223
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,141
IN ENGLAND, IT WAS A REAL CUTE,

224
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:50,442
LITTLE COUNTRY, BUT EVEN THOUGH

225
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:51,910
THEY SPOKE KIND OF LIKE

226
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,312
AMERICANS THE PLACE WAS LIKE

227
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:54,813
A REAL FOREIGN COUNTRY

228
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:55,914
OR SOMETHING, WHEN I ORDERED

229
00:06:55,914 --> 00:06:57,582
A BAG OF CHIPS I GOT FRIES,

230
00:06:57,582 --> 00:06:58,750
EVERYONE DROVE ON THE WRONG SIDE

231
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,952
OF THE ROAD AND THEIR MONEY

232
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,286
LOOKED REAL WEIRD.

233
00:07:01,286 --> 00:07:02,187
THIS YEAR WE'RE GOING TO COME UP

234
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:03,422
TO CANADA AND VISIT YOU PEOPLE,

235
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:07,859
IS IT WEIRD THERE TOO?'

236
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:08,894
I THINK BY WEIRD

237
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:10,228
HE MEANS DIFFERENT.

238
00:07:10,228 --> 00:07:11,096
>>RED: WELL THAT MAKES

239
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:12,164
YOU DIFFERENT THEN

240
00:07:12,164 --> 00:07:15,334
DOESN'T IT HAROLD?

241
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,435
OH YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK

242
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:17,302
YOU KNOW THERE'S ANY DIFFERENCE

243
00:07:17,302 --> 00:07:18,203
BETWEEN CANADIANS AND AMERICANS.

244
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:19,204
DOUGIE YOU'RE AN AMERICAN,

245
00:07:19,204 --> 00:07:20,005
WOULDN'T YOU SAY WE'RE

246
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:20,906
ABOUT THE SAME?

247
00:07:20,906 --> 00:07:21,973
>>DOUGIE: NO, SIR I WOULDN'T,

248
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:24,776
YOU CANADIANS ARE WEIRD.

249
00:07:24,776 --> 00:07:26,111
>>RED: HOW'S THAT?

250
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:27,779
>>DOUGIE: WELL I MEAN YOU KNOW

251
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:30,949
UP HERE A 240 ZEE IS A 240 ZED,

252
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:32,250
WHAT IS A ZED?

253
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:32,984
I MEAN YOU KNOW IT SOUNDS

254
00:07:32,984 --> 00:07:34,286
LIKE SOMETHING OFF HEE-HAW,

255
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:35,153
LOOKIE UP ON THE PORCH,

256
00:07:35,153 --> 00:07:39,191
IT'S UNCLE ZED.

257
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:40,425
>>RED: WHAT'S IN A NAME DOUGIE,

258
00:07:40,425 --> 00:07:41,326
IT DOESN'T MATTER A 'ZEE'

259
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:42,327
OR A 'ZED', IT'S THE SAME CAR,

260
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:43,395
IT GOES JUST AS FAST AND GETS

261
00:07:43,395 --> 00:07:44,596
THE SAME GAS MILEAGE UP HERE.

262
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:47,499
>>DOUGIE: NO SIR IT DOESN'T,

263
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:49,935
YOU GO 100 KILOMETERS AN HOUR,

264
00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:52,204
YOU GET MAYBE WHAT DO YOU SAY,

265
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:56,208
10 KILOMETERS TO THE LITER,

266
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,142
NOW I DON'T KNOW WHETHER

267
00:07:57,142 --> 00:08:00,278
THAT'S GOOD OR BAD,

268
00:08:00,278 --> 00:08:01,046
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER ANYBODY

269
00:08:01,046 --> 00:08:06,184
WHO WAS BORN HERE KNOWS EITHER.

270
00:08:06,184 --> 00:08:07,018
>>HAROLD: OKAY, ALL RIGHTY,

271
00:08:07,018 --> 00:08:07,786
BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE REALLY GOING

272
00:08:07,786 --> 00:08:09,087
THE SAME SPEEDS AND YOU KNOW

273
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:10,121
WE DRIVE ON THE SAME SIDE OF

274
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:11,990
THE HIGHWAY AS THE AMERICANS.

275
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,327
>>DOUGIE: NO SIR YOU DON'T.

276
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:16,561
ALL YOU CANADIANS, Y'ALL

277
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:22,968
DRIVE IN THE PASSING LANE.

278
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:24,402
NOW IN THE UNITED STATES OF

279
00:08:24,402 --> 00:08:26,538
AMERICA WE GOT YOUR DRIVING LANE

YOU JUST GO ANYWHERE YOU KNOW

284
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:35,513
THAT HAPPENS TO BE OPEN AND

285
00:08:35,513 --> 00:08:37,215
THERE YOU ARE, YOU TRY THAT

286
00:08:37,215 --> 00:08:38,583
IN THE 'US OF A', YOU COME

287
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:42,120
FACE TO FACE WITH THE COPS.

288
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,887
>>RED: WELL YOU HAVE THE

289
00:08:42,887 --> 00:08:43,955
SAME PROBLEM UP HERE DOUG.

290
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:44,956
>>DOUGIE: ABSOLUTELY NOT,

291
00:08:44,956 --> 00:08:46,358
NOPE, NO SIR YOU WOULDN'T,

292
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:47,525
YOU'D GET PULLED OVER BY YOUR

293
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:49,794
MOUNTIES AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW,

294
00:08:49,794 --> 00:08:51,096
LOOK AT THE WAY THOSE FELLOWS

295
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:54,933
ARE DRESSED WOULD YOU?

296
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:57,335
THEY'RE LIKE SECURITY GUARDS.

297
00:08:57,335 --> 00:08:59,270
NOW BACK HOME WE GOT

298
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,306
STATE TROOPERS, THEY'RE

299
00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:03,842
GUSSIED UP WITH GOLD BRAID

300
00:09:03,842 --> 00:09:04,743
THEY GOT YOUR BIG GUNS,

301
00:09:04,743 --> 00:09:05,744
10 GALLON HATS.

302
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:06,678
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN PULLED

303
00:09:06,678 --> 00:09:07,846
OVER BY A MOUNTIE

304
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:12,784
WEARING A 40 LITER HAT?

305
00:09:12,784 --> 00:09:14,786
I'M TELLING YOU, YOU CANADIANS

306
00:09:14,786 --> 00:09:16,688
ARE DIFFERENT THAN US AMERICANS,

307
00:09:16,688 --> 00:09:22,427
THE CAT IS OUT OF THE BAG.

308
00:09:22,427 --> 00:09:23,028
>>HAROLD: WELL PERHAPS IT'S

309
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:24,596
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE MORE TOLERANT

310
00:09:24,596 --> 00:09:26,064
AND WE'RE LESS LIKELY TO JUDGE

311
00:09:26,064 --> 00:09:27,399
FOREIGNERS AND WE'RE LIKE

312
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,434
A LITTLE LESS CLOSE MINDED

313
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:31,770
ABOUT DIFFERENT CULTURES.

314
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,172
>>DOUGIE: NO SIR, NO SIR

315
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:36,708
THAT'S ONE THING ACTUALLY

316
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:37,809
WE HAVE IN COMMON, YOU'RE JUST

317
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:39,277
AS NARROW MINDED AS WE ARE

318
00:09:39,277 --> 00:09:40,879
ONLY WE'RE UPFRONT ABOUT IT

319
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,347
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU TALK TO AN

320
00:09:42,347 --> 00:09:43,515
AMERICAN LIKE THIS, HE'S GOING

321
00:09:43,515 --> 00:09:45,183
TO BE JUST AS TICKED OFF AS

322
00:09:45,183 --> 00:09:47,886
YOU ARE BUT HE'LL LET YOU KNOW

323
00:09:47,886 --> 00:09:50,688
INSTEAD OF HIDING BEHIND YOU

324
00:09:50,688 --> 00:09:52,457
KNOW SOME KIND OF CONSTIPATED

325
00:09:52,457 --> 00:09:57,061
SMILE MAKING LIKE NONE

326
00:09:57,061 --> 00:10:02,800
OF THIS IS BUGGING HIM.

327
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,568
>>RED: WELL THANKS SO

328
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:06,905
MUCH FOR DROPPING BY DOUG.

329
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:07,572
>>HAROLD: IT'S GREAT

330
00:10:07,572 --> 00:10:08,740
HAVING YOU HERE.

331
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,607
>>RED: YUP, YUP,

332
00:10:09,607 --> 00:10:11,743
VERY INFORMATIVE, EXCELLENT.

333
00:10:11,743 --> 00:10:15,713
>>DOUGIE: YES, WEIRD.

334
00:10:17,048 --> 00:10:18,116
>>RED: IT IS SPRING,

335
00:10:18,116 --> 00:10:19,551
I WALK THROUGH THE WOODS

336
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:22,120

IS THAT THEY'RE OF ABSOLUTELY

360
00:10:56,988 --> 00:10:58,289

>>RED: THAT'S STING HAROLD

530
00:15:34,698 --> 00:15:37,000

00:15:37,835 --> 00:15:40,938

00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:07,598
THE TRUE SPIRIT OF THE

553
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:08,632
OLYMPICS THOUGH.

554
00:16:08,632 --> 00:16:09,700
>>RED: OH I DON'T KNOW HAROLD,

555
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,867
WE'VE ALREADY HAD 5 COUNTRIES

556
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:12,302
BOYCOTT US.

557
00:16:12,302 --> 00:16:13,170
>>HAROLD: NO, I'M TALKING

558
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,104
ABOUT THE MODERN TRUE SPIRIT,

559
00:16:14,104 --> 00:16:17,608
MARKETING AND LICENSING.

560
00:16:17,608 --> 00:16:18,842
THINK ABOUT THAT HUH?

561
00:16:18,842 --> 00:16:20,444
WE NEED LIKE AN OFFICIAL

562
00:16:20,444 --> 00:16:21,578

>>RED: WELL WE GOT AN OFFICIAL

00:16:25,983 --> 00:16:27,918
POSSUM VAN AND WE GOT AN

567
00:16:27,918 --> 00:16:29,920
OFFICIAL OUTHOUSE AND WE

568
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,954
CAN NAME AN OFFICIAL TREE.

569
00:16:30,954 --> 00:16:31,755
>>HAROLD: NO, NO, NO, NO,

570
00:16:31,755 --> 00:16:32,622
YOU'RE MISSING IT YOU SEE,

571
00:16:32,622 --> 00:16:33,957
WE NEED LIKE A LOGO MAYBE

572
00:16:33,957 --> 00:16:35,625
AND A LITTLE CARTOON CHARACTER

573
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,660
OF AN ANIMAL THAT WE CAN

574
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,296
MARKET TO DEATH YOU KNOW.

575
00:16:39,296 --> 00:16:40,263
>>RED: WELL WHAT KIND OF CUTE

576
00:16:40,263 --> 00:16:41,331
LITTLE CHARACTER COULD WE

577
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:42,332
HAVE FOR POSSUM LODGE AT

578
00:16:42,332 --> 00:16:48,905
THE POSSUM OLYMPICS?

579
00:16:53,777 --> 00:16:56,113
>>RED: NOW IT'S TIME ONCE AGAIN

580
00:16:56,113 --> 00:16:56,947
FOR 'ADVENTURES WITH BILL'.

581
00:16:56,947 --> 00:16:57,781
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT BILL HAD

582
00:16:57,781 --> 00:16:59,149
IN MIND THIS WEEK.

583
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:00,851
OH, OH IT'S HORSESHOES,

584
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:02,085
OH THAT'S NOT SO BAD

585
00:17:02,085 --> 00:17:02,953
I UNDERSTAND THAT HORSESHOES

586
00:17:02,953 --> 00:17:04,187
IS ONE OF THE SAFEST SPORTS

587
00:17:04,187 --> 00:17:07,023
EVER DEVISED BY MAN.

588
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:07,891
AS FAR AS I KNOW NO ONE'S EVER

589
00:17:07,891 --> 00:17:11,228
BEEN INJURED FROM HORSESHOES.

590
00:17:11,228 --> 00:17:12,229
THERE MIGHT BE ONE OR 2

591
00:17:12,229 --> 00:17:15,031
EXCEPTIONS I SUPPOSE

592
00:17:15,031 --> 00:17:16,633
OR 3 OR 4...

593
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:17,634
ANYWAY THE FIRST STEP IS

594
00:17:17,634 --> 00:17:18,969
TO PUT THE STEEL ROD.

595
00:17:18,969 --> 00:17:20,971
>>BILL:OH!

596
00:17:20,971 --> 00:17:23,607
>>RED: OH NOW I'M NOT

597
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:26,376
GOING TO COMMENT ON THAT,

598
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:27,777
WELL HE HAS HOPEFULLY ANOTHER

599
00:17:27,777 --> 00:17:29,146
STRONGER ROD THERE.

600
00:17:29,146 --> 00:17:30,313
YUP AND HE WANTS ME TO

601
00:17:30,313 --> 00:17:31,481
HOLD IT, THIS IS,

602
00:17:31,481 --> 00:17:32,582
I GOT TO LOOK AWAY,

603
00:17:32,582 --> 00:17:34,518
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT TOO,

604
00:17:34,518 --> 00:17:37,020
AND BY GOD NO, I DIDN'T REALLY

605
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,888
FEEL HIM HIT THE THING,

606
00:17:37,888 --> 00:17:38,822
I DIDN'T QUITE KNOW WHAT

607
00:17:38,822 --> 00:17:39,789
WAS GOING ON AND I JUST,

608
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:41,858
(THUD OF SHOE HITTING HEAD)

609
00:17:41,858 --> 00:17:43,860
OH I DID HEAR SOMETHING THOUGH

610
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,295
AND WHY WOULD HE BE LYING DOWN?

611
00:17:45,295 --> 00:17:47,764
OH WELL, SO HE TAPED THE

612
00:17:47,764 --> 00:17:48,698
HEAD BACK ON THAT AND I TAPED

613
00:17:48,698 --> 00:17:50,834
THE HEAD BACK ON THAT

614
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:54,537
AND THEN WE COULD TRY AGAIN.

615
00:17:54,537 --> 00:17:55,372
SO HE GOT THE THING LINED UP

616
00:17:55,372 --> 00:17:56,373
JUST GIVE HER A LITTLE,

617
00:17:56,373 --> 00:17:57,908
YOU KNOW THE SINKHOLES AROUND

618
00:17:57,908 --> 00:17:59,075
THE LODGE ARE REAL HANDY

619
00:17:59,075 --> 00:18:00,110
SOMETIMES, BUT THAT SEEMED,

620
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,345
I THOUGHT THAT, OH BOY!

621
00:18:02,345 --> 00:18:03,246
IT IS A DANGEROUS SPORT

622
00:18:03,246 --> 00:18:03,980
ISN'T IT BILL?

623
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,715
>>BILL: OH!

624
00:18:05,715 --> 00:18:06,816
>>RED: YEAH I THINK IT IS,

625
00:18:06,816 --> 00:18:08,451
YEAH, ANYWAY I THOUGHT

626
00:18:08,451 --> 00:18:10,720
WELL THAT POLE BEING SO

627
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,289
LOW IN THE GROUND YOU KNOW,

628
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:13,223
I DON'T KNOW, I THINK

629
00:18:13,223 --> 00:18:14,190
THAT'S MORE DANGEROUS,

630
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:14,924
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE

631
00:18:14,924 --> 00:18:15,925
ABLE TO CATCH THE THING?

632
00:18:15,925 --> 00:18:16,926
WOULDN'T IT GO RIGHT OVER

633
00:18:16,926 --> 00:18:19,796
LIKE THAT, INTO THAT?

634
00:18:19,796 --> 00:18:22,565
WOULDN'T THAT HAPPEN BILL?

635
00:18:22,565 --> 00:18:23,366
THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO

636
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:24,334
BOTHER HIM TOO MUCH,

637
00:18:24,334 --> 00:18:25,201
IT WASN'T HIS VAN.

638
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:26,302
BUT THEN HE STARTS JUST KIND

639
00:18:26,302 --> 00:18:27,704
OF FIRING THEM AND THEN WE

640
00:18:27,704 --> 00:18:30,640
HAD KIND OF A GANG SHOOT HERE,

641
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,413
OH MY GOSH AND HMM,

642
00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:41,518
OH YEAH, I DON'T KNOW QUITE

643
00:18:41,518 --> 00:18:43,219
HOW TO SCORE THOSE.

644
00:18:43,219 --> 00:18:44,421
I WAS NOT REAL WITH BILL

645
00:18:44,421 --> 00:18:46,523
THAT WAS ALL MY STUFF.

646
00:18:46,523 --> 00:18:47,824
JUST EASY, RELAX, RELAX,

647
00:18:47,824 --> 00:18:48,825
YOU GO GET THE HORSESHOES.

648
00:18:48,825 --> 00:18:49,826
HE'S GOT AN IDEA,

649
00:18:49,826 --> 00:18:50,627
WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO NOW

650
00:18:50,627 --> 00:18:53,363
TAKE THAT RAKE AND STICK IT

651
00:18:53,363 --> 00:18:54,197
ON THERE AND HE'S GOING TO

652
00:18:54,197 --> 00:18:54,998
DUCT TAPE THAT TO THE

653
00:18:54,998 --> 00:18:55,865
LITTLE POLE,

654
00:18:55,865 --> 00:18:56,800
NOW HE'S GOT A GREAT

655
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,468
BIG POLE TO SHOOT AT,

656
00:18:58,468 --> 00:18:59,469
YEAH THAT SEEMS A LITTLE MORE

657
00:18:59,469 --> 00:19:02,472
SENSIBLE BUT JUST IN CASE

658
00:19:02,472 --> 00:19:04,474
HE'S GOING TO BACK UP JUST,

659
00:19:04,474 --> 00:19:05,875
YEAH, YEAH, TAKE SOME OF

660
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,511
THE DANGER OUT OF THE SPORT.

661
00:19:08,511 --> 00:19:09,479
AND HE THROWS A WHOLE BUNCH

662
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:10,513
AT ONCE THERE AND OH THEY'RE

663
00:19:10,513 --> 00:19:13,850
COMING IN LIKE THE B-49 BOMBER,

664
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,051
AND DOWN GOES THE POLE

665
00:19:15,051 --> 00:19:16,052
AND THEN UP SHE COMES,

666
00:19:16,052 --> 00:19:16,853
FIRES THEM RIGHT BACK TOWARDS

667
00:19:16,853 --> 00:19:18,121
BILL AND THERE'S, OH BOY!

668
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:21,758
