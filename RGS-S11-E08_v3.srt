1
00:00:02,702 --> 00:00:04,804
THEY STILL GOT
A FEW FLAWS IN 'EM.

2
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:06,940
FOR EXAMPLE,
HEADLIGHT DESIGN.

3
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:09,275
HEADLIGHTS ONLY POINT IN THE
DIRECTION THAT YOU'RE GOING.

4
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:12,912
HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO
SEE STREET SIGNS OR HOUSE
NUMBERS OR HITCHHIKERS?

5
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:15,048
WHAT YOU NEED IS SOME KIND
OF MOVABLE SEARCH LIGHT

6
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,916
THAT POINTS WHEREVER
YOU'RE LOOKING.

7
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:22,055
I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE USELESS
DRIVERS THAT NEEDS TO KEEP
HIS EYES ON THE ROAD,

8
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:24,691
AND WITH THIS RIG
I CAN SEE EVERYTHING.

9
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,793
I CAN EVEN LOOK BEHIND ME.

10
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:32,599
[crash]

11
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,875
DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.

12
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:50,049
[cheering and applause]

13
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:56,656
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

14
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:59,158
THANK YOU. APPRECIATE THAT.

15
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,728
[whistling and applause]

16
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:09,002
WELL, BEEN KINDA QUIET
AT THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

17
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:11,371
NOT THE KIND OF QUIET THAT
HAPPENS JUST BEFORE

18
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,607
THE ENTIRE SIOUX NATION
COMES UP OVER THE RIDGE.

19
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,910
NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT
A PEACEFUL QUIET;

20
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:19,779
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU CAN JUST
LAY BACK, CLOSE YOUR EYES,

21
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:23,049
AND BATHE IN
THE SOUNDS OF NATURE.

22
00:01:23,082 --> 00:01:25,151
MR. GREEN!
MR. GREEN!

23
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:27,787
OKAY, THAT WAS MORE
OF A SPONGE BATH.

24
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:30,123
WHAT IS IT,
MIKE?

25
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:33,960
MR. GREEN, WERE YOU UP
WALKING AROUND LATE LAST
NIGHT IN THE LODGE?

26
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:37,096
OH, YEAH, PRETTY LATE,
9:30, MAYBE 10:00.

27
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:39,399
I'M TALKING ABOUT
LIKE 2:00 IN THE MORNING,

28
00:01:39,465 --> 00:01:41,734
WALKING BACK AND
FORTH IN HERE.

29
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,636
OH, NO, IF I WAS UP
AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING,

30
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:46,539
I WAS IN A LOT
SMALLER ROOM THAN THIS.

31
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,742
I KNEW IT!
WE HAVE A GHOST.

32
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,644
I CAN ALWAYS TELL.

33
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:54,647
WELL, YOU'RE FAMILIAR
WITH SPIRITS, I KNOW THAT.

34
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:58,618
NO, NO, I CAN SENSE THE
PRESENCE OF THE SUPERNATURAL.

35
00:01:58,684 --> 00:02:00,720
I HAVE BEEN
TOUCHED BY THE GIFT.

36
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,088
NOW, I KNOW YOU
DON'T BELIEVE ALL THAT.

37
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,524
WELL, I BELIEVE
THE TOUCHED PART.

38
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:08,828
MR. GREEN, THIS IS A GHOST,
AND HE'S HERE.

39
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,497
HAVE YOU EVER FELT THE ROOM
SUDDENLY GO COLD?

40
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:15,168
MIKE, EVERY MARRIED
MAN IN THE WORLD HAS
EXPERIENCED THAT.

41
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:17,003
[laughter and applause]

42
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:19,972
WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF THINGS
IN THE LODGE THAT COULD
PASS AS GHOSTS.

43
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,275
WE GOT MICE IN THE WALLS;
THERE'S SQUIRRELS IN THE --

44
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:25,978
THERE'S SOME CHEESE DOWNSTAIRS
THAT'LL STAND UP AND
TALK TO YOU.

45
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:28,414
THAT'S FINE.
YOU CAN BE SKEPTICAL.

46
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,383
BUT I'M TELLING YOU,
THERE IS A GHOST

47
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,319
SOMEWHERE IN
POSSUM LODGE.

48
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:39,425
[slam]

49
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,295
HE'S OUT RIGHT NOW.
WOULD YOU CARE TO
LEAVE A MESSAGE?

50
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:51,137
IT'S TIME FOR
THE POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

51
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,040
[cheering and applause]

52
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,917
TODAY'S WINNER RECEIVES THIS
DELUXE TATTOO REMOVAL KIT.

53
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:10,856
OKAY, DALTON, COVER UP
THE OL' SIDE MIRRORS THERE.

54
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,758
HAROLD, YOU'VE GOT
30 SECONDS

55
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,594
TO GET DALTON HUMPHREY
TO SAY THIS WORD...

56
00:03:17,863 --> 00:03:19,465
OKAY, OKAY.
THANK YOU, WINSTON.

57
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,666
AND GO!

58
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,635
OKAY, THIS IS A PEST
THAT COMES AROUND

59
00:03:22,668 --> 00:03:24,203
AND BOTHERS PEOPLE
WHEN THEY'RE EATING.

60
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,706
RICHARD SIMMONS?

61
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,608
BIRDS AND BEES CAN DO IT.

62
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:32,011
OH, SORRY.
I USED TO KNOW.

63
00:03:33,312 --> 00:03:34,814
OKAY, THIS IS
SOMETHING BIRDS CAN DO

64
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,782
AND MOST PEOPLE
WISH THEY COULD.

65
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,618
OH, OH, RELIEVE THEMSELVES
WHENEVER THEY WANT.

66
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:42,888
NO, NO.
THAT'S NOT IT.

67
00:03:42,955 --> 00:03:45,791
THIS IS SOMETHING YOU WOULD
FIND ON THE FRONT
OF YOUR PANTS.

68
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,062
SOUP STAINS.

69
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:51,864
YOU'RE ALMOST OUTTA TIME.
NO!

70
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:54,066
IT'S HIM!
TELL HIM!

71
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,669
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, UM,
IF YOU SUDDENLY FIND
YOURSELF UP IN THE SKY

72
00:03:56,702 --> 00:03:58,404
ABOVE YOUR HOUSE,
WHAT WOULD YOU BE DOING?

73
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,940
LIGHTING MY BARBECUE.

74
00:04:01,006 --> 00:04:02,808
COME ON, DALTON!

75
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:05,177
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF
A CARTOON CHARACTER
NAMED DUMBO?

76
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,812
OH, HE WAS SO CUTE
WITH THOSE BIG EARS.

77
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,614
OKAY, WHAT COULD HE DO?

78
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,616
HE COULD HEAR,
THAT'S FOR SURE!

79
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:12,785
YES, HE COULD HEAR, BUT HE
COULD DO SOMETHING SPECIAL.

80
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:15,187
TO PEOPLE.
HE WAS NICE
WHAT?

81
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:17,356
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M LOOKING FOR!

82
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:18,991
WELL, NOBODY IS.

83
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:21,193
THEY DON'T APPRECIATE
A GENTLE SOUL LIKE DUMBO.

84
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,595
WOULDN'T HURT A FLY.

85
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:24,230
[ringing bell]

86
00:04:24,296 --> 00:04:26,031
THAT'S IT.

87
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,007
WHEN YOUR SEPTICS GO BAD,

88
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,475
THERE'S NO ONE TO BLAME.

89
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,178
NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE
OR COWER IN SHAME.

90
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,480
CALL FOR A PUMP-OUT,
ROTHSCHILD'S THE NAME.

91
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:44,416
IT BEATS LOSING YOUR HOME
IN A HUGE PURPLE FLAME.

92
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:52,524
OH, MAN, A DENT!

93
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:54,460
DON'T YOU HATE THAT?

94
00:04:54,493 --> 00:04:56,195
YOU TRY TO KEEP YOUR
VEHICLE LOOKING MINT,

95
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:59,098
AND THEN SOME
BONEHEAD COMES ALONG

96
00:04:59,164 --> 00:05:02,001
AND NAILS YOU WITH HIS
DOOR IN A PARKING LOT.

97
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:04,403
AND OF COURSE
NO NOTE OR ANYTHING.

98
00:05:04,436 --> 00:05:05,671
OH, NO.

99
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:08,040
THE GUY DOESN'T EVEN HAVE THE
GUTS TO ADMIT HIS MISTAKE

100
00:05:08,073 --> 00:05:10,175
AND FACE IT LIKE A MAN.

101
00:05:10,242 --> 00:05:11,910
I TELL YOU SOMETHING,

102
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:15,347
I'VE GOT AN IDEA THAT MIGHT
JUST BE CRAZY ENOUGH TO WORK.

103
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:18,817
AND I GUARANTEE YOU THIS,

104
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:20,886
I'M AT LEAST CRAZY
ENOUGH TO TRY IT.

105
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,055
[tires squealing]

106
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:33,432
ALL RIGHT, THIS HERE
IS AN ARC WELDER.

107
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,801
OH, YEAH,
THERE YOU ARE.

108
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:37,403
THIS IS AN ARC WELDER HERE.

109
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:39,471
I JUST USED IT TO FIX
THE FRAME ON THIS BICYCLE.

110
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:41,440
YOU GET A REAL STRONG
WELD TO THIS BABY.

111
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,276
LOOK AT THIS.

112
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,745
YOU KNOW, I'M THINKING THIS
IS GONNA BE THE KEY COMPONENT

113
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:50,816
IN MY PARKING LOT CRIMINAL
IDENTIFICATION DEVICE.

114
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:53,619
I'M GONNA NEED A
BETTER NAME BEFORE
I GO NATIONAL WITH THIS.

115
00:05:53,652 --> 00:05:56,054
BUT MY FIRST AND
ONLY REAL PROBLEM IS

116
00:05:56,121 --> 00:05:58,490
COMING UP WITH ENOUGH
PORTABLE ELECTRICITY
TO POWER THE UNIT.

117
00:06:03,195 --> 00:06:04,897
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE
A LOT OF GREAT ADVANTAGES

118
00:06:04,963 --> 00:06:07,366
TO HAVING VEHICLES LYING
AROUND YOUR PROPERTY.

119
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,168
YOU CAN USE 'EM AS TOOL SHEDS,

120
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:11,103
BUS SHELTERS FOR THE KIDS,

121
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,705
AND GUEST CABINS
FOR YOUR WIFE'S RELATIVES.

122
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:16,375
HERE'S A BONUS
THAT I TAPPED INTO.

123
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:19,278
EVERY ONE OF THOSE VEHICLES
HAS GOT A BATTERY IN IT,

124
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:23,482
SO I CAN HOOK THEM ALL UP
TO RUN MY ARC WELDER.

125
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,450
I'M GONNA HOOK THEM UP
IN UNEVEN SERIES HERE.

126
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:26,752
[zap!]

127
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:43,735
OKAY, WE'RE GOOD TO GO HERE.

128
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:45,837
GOTTA SET MY TRAP.

129
00:06:45,871 --> 00:06:49,975
FIRST THING YOU WANNA DO
IS TAKE THE GROUND WIRE
OF THE ARC WELDER

130
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,344
AND ATTACH THAT
TO THE GROUND.

131
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:55,881
OKAY, NOW YOU WANNA
TAKE THE LIVE END

132
00:06:55,914 --> 00:06:58,417
AND ATTACH THAT
DIRECTLY TO THE VAN.

133
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:02,587
I WOULD SUGGEST YOU
DO THAT KINDA QUICK.

134
00:07:02,621 --> 00:07:04,456
OKAY, AND YOU'RE
GOOD TO GO.

135
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:07,726
NOW IF SOMEONE SHOULD COME
ALONG AND HAPPEN TO
TOUCH THE VAN

136
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,861
WITH, SAY, THEIR DOOR,

137
00:07:09,895 --> 00:07:14,566
WELL, THEY GET TO LEARN JUST
A LITTLE BIG MORE ABOUT
ELECTRICITY.

138
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,269
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

139
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,171
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

140
00:07:35,887 --> 00:07:37,522
[chuckling]

141
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:39,825
HEY, BUDDY,
YOU LOOKIN' FOR SOMEONE?

142
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:46,965
UH, I THINK THE OWNER
OF THE VAN IS IN
THE STORE.

143
00:07:47,032 --> 00:07:48,733
HAVE A GREAT DAY.

144
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,616
[cheering and applause]

145
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:12,290
MEN HAVE TROUBLE
COMMUNICATING.

146
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:13,792
THEY SAY WE DON'T
TALK VERY MUCH.

147
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:15,961
YOU OLDER GUYS KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

148
00:08:15,994 --> 00:08:18,430
REMEMBER 20 YEARS AGO WHEN YOU
ASKED YOUR WIFE TO MARRY YOU

149
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:21,833
AND SHE'S BEEN WAITING FOR
A HALF DECENT FOLLOW-UP
QUESTION EVER SINCE?

150
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:26,037
AND IT'S NOT, "ARE YOU GONNA
FINISH THAT SANDWICH?"

151
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:29,140
BUT I FIND THAT
AS MEN GET OLDER

152
00:08:29,207 --> 00:08:32,010
THEY ACTUALLY TALK MORE
THAN THEY DID WHEN
THEY WERE YOUNG.

153
00:08:32,043 --> 00:08:35,614
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THEY'RE
THE ONLY ONES IN THE ROOM.

154
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:37,716
YOU'VE ALL BEEN
THERE, HAVEN'T YOU?

155
00:08:37,782 --> 00:08:40,385
WANDERING AROUND THE HOUSE,
LOOKING FOR YOUR CAR KEYS.

156
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:42,954
PRETTY SOON YOU'RE MUTTERING
AWAY LIKE THAT WEIRD GUY
IN THE PARK

157
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:45,857
WHO THINKS YOUR
DOG IS A COMMUNIST.

158
00:08:45,924 --> 00:08:47,692
OH, SURE, SOMETIMES
WE TRY TO COVER

159
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,761
BY TALKING TO
THE TV OR THE RADIO,

160
00:08:49,794 --> 00:08:52,998
BUT I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT
DEEP DOWN THAT THE GUY
SELLING SPEED STICK

161
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:57,068
CAN'T HEAR YOU TELLING HIM
WHERE TO SPEED STICK IT.

162
00:08:57,402 --> 00:09:01,039
BUT IN MY OPINION, TALKING TO
YOURSELF IS NOTHING TO
BE ASHAMED OF.

163
00:09:01,072 --> 00:09:02,607
I MEAN, YOU HAVE THINGS
THAT NEED TO BE SAID,

164
00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:04,609
AND YOU DON'T
WANNA OFFEND ANYBODY.

165
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:07,078
YOU KNOW, BY SAYING THEM TO
YOURSELF WHEN YOU'RE ALONE

166
00:09:07,112 --> 00:09:08,947
YOU'RE PROBABLY SAVING
YOUR JOB, YOUR MARRIAGE,

167
00:09:09,014 --> 00:09:11,483
MAYBE EVEN YOUR LIFE.

168
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:14,019
SO LADIES, WHEN YOU SEE US
TALKING TO OURSELVES,

169
00:09:14,052 --> 00:09:16,221
JUST LEAVE US ALONE.

170
00:09:16,254 --> 00:09:18,089
YOU'LL KNOW WHEN WE'RE READY
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION

171
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:20,291
BECAUSE WE'LL CLAM UP.

172
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:21,993
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

173
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,728
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

174
00:09:23,795 --> 00:09:26,264
[applause]

175
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:30,802
YEAH! YEAH!
( waking up )
HEY, RED, YOU IN THERE?

176
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:33,838
WELL, YOU FINALLY
MADE IT, HUH, WINSTON?

177
00:09:33,905 --> 00:09:35,440
YEAH, WELL, I'M IN
A BIT OF A HURRY,

178
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:37,409
SO IF YOU HAVE
ANYTHING TO TELL ME,
YOU BETTER FIRE AWAY.

179
00:09:37,475 --> 00:09:40,278
OH, OKAY, WELL, I KNOW
YOU DON'T GO ON DATES
VERY OFTEN, WINSTON,

180
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:42,347
AND I JUST WANTED TO
GIVE YOU A FEW TIPS.

181
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:44,849
FOR EXAMPLE, PICKING
HER UP ON FOOT

182
00:09:44,883 --> 00:09:47,452
IS NEVER PARTICULARLY
IMPRESSIVE, ALL RIGHT?

183
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,454
OH, IN KNOW THAT.
I'M JUST PARKED
DOWN THE ROAD.

184
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:51,523
ANYTHING ELSE?
IS THERE
OH.

185
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:53,057
YEAH, WELL, OKAY.

186
00:09:53,124 --> 00:09:55,326
WELL, FOR STARTERS,
YOUR WARDROBE CHOICE

187
00:09:55,393 --> 00:09:58,463
DOESN'T EXACTLY
SCREAM ROMANCE.

188
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:02,267
HEY, I'M PRESENTING MYSELF
AS A SUCCESSFUL
ENTREPRENEUR.

189
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,936
I DON'T CARE IF SHE KNOWS
I'M IN THE SEWAGE BUSINESS.

190
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:06,404
WELL, SHE'D BE ABLE
TO FIGURE THAT OUT

191
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:08,773
NO MATTER WHAT
YOU WERE WEARING.

192
00:10:08,806 --> 00:10:11,442
OH, MAN, ARE YOU PICKING
HER UP IN YOUR
SEPTIC TRUCK?

193
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:14,279
HEY, THIS IS A
$90,000 VEHICLE.

194
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:16,581
IT'S LIKE BEING PICKED
UP IN A MERCEDES.

195
00:10:16,614 --> 00:10:18,316
BESIDES, IT'S GONNA
BE DARK BY THEN,

196
00:10:18,383 --> 00:10:22,353
AND THIS BABY LOOKS
PRETTY SHARP AT NIGHT.

197
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,822
YOU KNOW, WINSTON,
DARKNESS DOESN'T
HIDE AROMA.

198
00:10:24,856 --> 00:10:26,858
IF YOU WERE MARRIED,
YOU'D KNOW THAT.

199
00:10:26,925 --> 00:10:29,627
OH, I GOT HER
THESE FLOWERS.

200
00:10:29,694 --> 00:10:31,496
GEEZ, WHAT
HAPPENED TO 'EM?

201
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:33,298
OVER FERTILIZED?

202
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:34,799
I GUESS SO.

203
00:10:34,866 --> 00:10:36,234
ANYWAY, I GOTTA
GET GOING.

204
00:10:36,267 --> 00:10:38,202
I GOTTA PICK HER
UP AT 8:30.

205
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:40,271
OH, I MEANT TO ASK YOU,

206
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,143
AND I WAS THINKING I COULD
JUST DO IT ON THE WAY
TO THE DRIVE-IN.

207
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:49,147
YOU KNOW, GIVE HER A CHANCE
TO SORT OF SEE ME IN ACTION.

208
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:51,115
OR SHOULD I JUST
CANCEL THE PUMP-OUT?

209
00:10:51,182 --> 00:10:52,850
NO, DON'T CANCEL.

210
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:54,485
IF YOU'RE PICKING
HER UP AT 8:30,

211
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,287
I FIGURE THE DATE'LL
BE OVER BY NINE.

212
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:57,655
GREAT!

213
00:11:05,997 --> 00:11:07,632
[coughing]

214
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:13,237
WELL, MIKE'S GOT
EVERYBODY STIRRED UP

215
00:11:13,304 --> 00:11:14,939
ABOUT THIS
LODGE GHOST THING.

216
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:16,474
HE'S THE ONLY
ONE WHO'S SEEN IT.

217
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,609
BUT NOW THE OTHER GUYS ARE
SAYING STUFF IS BEING MOVED,

218
00:11:18,643 --> 00:11:20,511
AND THE LODGE
IS ALL MESSED UP.

219
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,318
I HAVEN'T NOTICED ANYTHING.

220
00:11:27,385 --> 00:11:29,220
I THINK I KNOW
WHO THE GHOST IS.

221
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:32,056
I FOUND THIS OLD OBITUARY
COLUMN FROM THE '50s.

222
00:11:32,123 --> 00:11:35,660
DID YOU EVER HEAR OF A LODGE
MEMBER BY THE NAME OF
HENRY THORKELSON?

223
00:11:35,726 --> 00:11:38,863
OH, SURE,
THE POSSUM LAKE WIGGLER.

224
00:11:41,165 --> 00:11:42,900
DID HE HAVE
A NERVOUS TWITCH?

225
00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:44,569
NO, HE INVENTED A LURE.

226
00:11:44,635 --> 00:11:45,903
HE CALLED IT
THE POSSUM LAKE WIGGLER.

227
00:11:45,937 --> 00:11:47,738
HE ONLY MADE ONE OF 'EM.

228
00:11:47,805 --> 00:11:49,474
WELL, YOU KNOW,
A LOT OF THE TIME,

229
00:11:49,507 --> 00:11:52,176
GHOSTS ARE PEOPLE
WHO DIED UNEXPECTEDLY,

230
00:11:52,243 --> 00:11:53,711
AND IT SAYS IN
THIS COLUMN HERE

231
00:11:53,744 --> 00:11:56,314
THAT HENRY THORKELSON WAS
IN A BOATING ACCIDENT.

232
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,015
NO, NO, NOT REALLY.

233
00:11:58,049 --> 00:11:59,984
HE JUMPED ON THE MAIN DOCK
AND THE BOARD COME UP,

234
00:12:00,017 --> 00:12:01,552
HIT HIM ON THE HEAD
AND KNOCKED HIM INTO

235
00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:03,855
THE SPINNING PROP
OF THE FLOAT PLANE.

236
00:12:03,921 --> 00:12:07,425
SO IT WAS REALLY
MORE OF A PLANE CRASH.

237
00:12:07,491 --> 00:12:10,094
WERE THEY ABLE
TO SAVE HIM?

238
00:12:10,161 --> 00:12:11,929
WELL, THEY SAVED
A FAIR BIT OF HIM.

239
00:12:11,996 --> 00:12:13,431
audience: O-O-H!

240
00:12:13,497 --> 00:12:15,466
YOU KNOW THE SAD THING
WAS HE NEVER GOT TO
USE THAT LURE.

241
00:12:15,499 --> 00:12:16,901
HE WAS SO PROUD
OF THAT THING.

242
00:12:16,968 --> 00:12:18,869
ODD LOOKING.
IT WAS YELLOW
AND ORANGE.

243
00:12:18,936 --> 00:12:20,438
IT HAD A RUBBER
WING ON IT,

244
00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:22,373
AND THE EYES LOOKED LIKE
THEY WERE JEWELS, YOU KNOW.

245
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,542
IT'S AROUND THE
LODGE SOMEWHERE.

246
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:26,143
UH -- WELL -- NO.

247
00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:27,845
I ACTUALLY BELIEVE
THAT THAT LURE

248
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:30,781
SOMEHOW FOUND ITS WAY
TO MY PLACE.

249
00:12:30,848 --> 00:12:32,850
NOW, I DON'T KNOW HOW
THAT COULD'VE HAPPENED.

250
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:36,053
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE I
SLIPPED IT HOME IN MY TOOLBOX

251
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:38,923
AFTER LAST WEEK'S
MEETING OR ANYTHING.

252
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,059
I THINK I'LL JUST GO
BACK HOME -- NIP BACK HOME

253
00:12:42,126 --> 00:12:44,762
AND I'LL BRING THE
LURE BACK HERE, OKAY?

254
00:12:44,795 --> 00:12:47,732
MAKE THE GHOST
MORE SATISFIED,
HAPPY, AND --

255
00:12:47,798 --> 00:12:50,835
YEAH, YOU KNOW, MIKE,
I THINK THAT'S A
GREAT IDEA.

256
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:52,870
I MEAN, IT'S NO
BIG DEAL, RIGHT?

257
00:12:52,937 --> 00:12:55,306
I MEAN, YOU SAID YOURSELF
IT WAS A LOUSY LURE.

258
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:57,508
I MEAN, IT NEVER
CAUGHT ANYTHING.

259
00:12:57,575 --> 00:12:59,877
NOT UNTIL NOW, NO.

260
00:13:03,614 --> 00:13:05,015
Red: UH, ONCE A YEAR
WE GO OUT THE BACK

261
00:13:05,082 --> 00:13:06,317
AND TRY TO CLEAN UP LODGE.

262
00:13:06,384 --> 00:13:07,885
I HATE THAT DAY.

263
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:10,521
DALTON SAID HE'D HELP,
AND HE HAD SOME KIND
OF A PLAN.

264
00:13:10,588 --> 00:13:11,889
HE WAS GONNA
BRING A MACHINE.

265
00:13:11,956 --> 00:13:13,290
I WASN'T QUITE SURE
WHAT HE WAS GONNA DO.

266
00:13:13,324 --> 00:13:14,625
WE HAD A DUMPSTER
ALL SET THERE.

267
00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:18,295
THERE'S DALTON NOW.
HE'S GOT THE TRUCK.

268
00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:21,565
HE'S GOT SOMETHING IN THE
BACK HE'S GONNA USE FOR
THE CLEAN-UP HE SAID.

269
00:13:21,632 --> 00:13:23,334
I DIDN'T KNOW --

270
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:25,102
BY GOLLY, I BELIEVE THAT'S
A JET ENGINE, ISN'T IT?

271
00:13:28,072 --> 00:13:29,940
FIRST THING WE GOTTA DO,
WE GOTTA GET HER OUTTA THE --

272
00:13:30,007 --> 00:13:31,609
THEY'RE HEAVY.
THOSE UNITS ARE HEAVY.

273
00:13:31,642 --> 00:13:34,845
I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY FLY.
THEN DALTON GETS AN IDEA.

274
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:37,681
IT'S A JET ENGINE.
IT'LL GET ITSELF
OUTTA THE TRUCK.

275
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:43,120
THERE WE GO.

276
00:13:43,187 --> 00:13:45,389
SO NOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO
IS USE THE JET ENGINE

277
00:13:45,456 --> 00:13:47,191
AS BASICALLY A
VACUUM CLEANER.

278
00:13:47,224 --> 00:13:49,927
SO WE DUCT TAPED HER TO
THE SIDE OF THE DUMPSTER.

279
00:13:49,994 --> 00:13:52,296
THEN WE RAN A HOSE
OFF THE INTAKE SIDE.

280
00:13:52,363 --> 00:13:53,797
THEN DALTON SAID --
I'LL FIRE IT UP,

281
00:13:53,864 --> 00:13:55,366
AND LET'S SEE
HOW SHE'S GOES.

282
00:13:55,432 --> 00:13:58,035
OH, BOY.

283
00:13:58,102 --> 00:14:00,104
OH, MY GOSH!

284
00:14:00,137 --> 00:14:02,706
THAT THINGS GOT A LOT --
HOLY COW!

285
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:05,175
THERE'S THE
GARDEN HOSE EVEN.

286
00:14:05,242 --> 00:14:08,412
WOW!
LOOK AT THAT THING GO!

287
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:10,381
THAT'S GOT A LOT --
OH, MY GOODNESS.

288
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:11,815
LOTTA SUCTION.

289
00:14:11,849 --> 00:14:13,417
YEAH, IT WORKS ON
DRY STUFF, DALTON.

290
00:14:13,484 --> 00:14:15,619
BUT HOW DOES SHE FARE
WITH THE WET STUFF, HUH?

291
00:14:15,653 --> 00:14:18,055
THAT'S WHAT I
ALWAYS WANNA KNOW.

292
00:14:18,122 --> 00:14:20,791
OH, MY GOLLY,
PRETTY DARNED GOOD.

293
00:14:20,824 --> 00:14:22,860
LOOK AT THAT.
OH, HO-HO.

294
00:14:22,927 --> 00:14:24,461
OH, BOY.

295
00:14:24,495 --> 00:14:26,497
AND THERE'S OUR WHOLE YARD
CLEANED UP IN ABOUT
FIVE MINUTES.

296
00:14:26,563 --> 00:14:27,998
FANTASTIC JOB.

297
00:14:28,032 --> 00:14:29,500
WELL, I JUST --
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME.

298
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:31,035
I WANNA JUST -- I'LL GO IN
AND WATCH THE GAME NOW.

299
00:14:31,101 --> 00:14:33,003
BUT, DALTON, HE WANTS TO --
I DON'T WANNA --

300
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:34,672
DALTON, I DON'T CARE.

301
00:14:34,738 --> 00:14:36,473
NO, I KNOW IT WORKS.
IT'S FINE.

302
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,808
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

303
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,644
I'VE SEEN A DUMPSTER
FULL OF GARBAGE BEFORE.

304
00:14:40,711 --> 00:14:43,147
WHAT?
WELL, THIS ONE ISN'T.

305
00:14:43,213 --> 00:14:45,883
WHERE THE HECK?
OH, DALTON.

306
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:49,720
I THINK YOU MISJUDGED WHERE
YOU PLACED THE JET ENGINE.

307
00:14:52,823 --> 00:14:55,259
ALL RIGHT, WELL, NOW HE
GETS TO DRIVE IT AWAY.

308
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:57,661
[applause]

309
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:06,103
TODAY ON THE TALKING
ANIMALS PORTION
OF OUR SHOW,

310
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,338
LOCAL ANIMAL
CONTROL OFFICER, ED FRID,

311
00:15:08,372 --> 00:15:11,341
IS GONNA TELL US
ALL ABOUT FOXES.

312
00:15:11,408 --> 00:15:12,643
YEAH.
THAT'S RIGHT, RED.

313
00:15:12,676 --> 00:15:14,344
OR AS THEY'RE KNOWN IN THE
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY,

314
00:15:14,378 --> 00:15:16,814
Vulpes vulpes.

315
00:15:16,847 --> 00:15:19,082
WOW!
WHAT DOES Vulpes MEAN?

316
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:21,518
FOX.

317
00:15:21,552 --> 00:15:24,888
SO THE SCIENTIFIC
NAME IS FOX FOX?

318
00:15:24,922 --> 00:15:26,857
SEEM A LITTLE
REDUNDANT TO YOU?

319
00:15:26,924 --> 00:15:28,792
WELL, NOT IF YOU
GOT ONE CHASIN' YOU.

320
00:15:28,826 --> 00:15:31,228
YOU KNOW,
FOX! FOX! FOX!

321
00:15:31,261 --> 00:15:33,397
OKAY.
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
FOX! FOX! FOX!

322
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,399
I UNDERSTAND.
OKAY.

323
00:15:35,432 --> 00:15:37,267
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
BRING HIM OUT HERE?

324
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:40,103
YEAH.
OKAY, UH --

325
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,872
ACTUALLY, RED, YOU KNOW,

326
00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:43,373
IT'S A SHE,

327
00:15:43,407 --> 00:15:46,577
AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO REFER
TO THE FEMALES AS VIXENS.

328
00:15:46,643 --> 00:15:49,112
I'M NOT DOING THAT,
THANKS, ANYWAY, ED.

329
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:50,881
JUST GET THE FOX
FOR US, WILL YOU?

330
00:15:50,914 --> 00:15:52,716
YEAH. MM-HMM.
RIGHT.

331
00:15:52,783 --> 00:15:54,885
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
SOMETHING ELSE I
JUST REMEMBERED

332
00:15:54,952 --> 00:15:57,087
IS FOXES REALLY
AREN'T ALL THAT SLY.

333
00:15:57,154 --> 00:15:58,455
THAT'S JUST
A MYTH.

334
00:15:58,522 --> 00:16:02,759
I FIND THAT THEIR
INTENTIONS ARE VERY CLEAR.

335
00:16:02,826 --> 00:16:05,462
GET THE FOX, ED.

336
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:08,365
YOU GOT IT.
YOU GOT IT.

337
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:11,702
YOU KNOW, RED,

338
00:16:11,735 --> 00:16:13,604
UM, I THINK MOST
PEOPLE ALREADY KNOW

339
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,205
WHAT A FOX LOOKS LIKE.

340
00:16:15,238 --> 00:16:17,708
ED, YOU'RE DOIN' A SEGMENT
ON MY SHOW ABOUT FOXES.

341
00:16:17,774 --> 00:16:20,577
OF COURSE YOU DO.
TO SEE A FOX.
I THINK WE NEED

342
00:16:20,611 --> 00:16:23,814
ALL RIGHT, FOR THOSE OF YOU
HERE IN THE STUDIO AUDIENCE,

343
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,283
I WOULD CAUTION YOU,
DO NOT MAKE ANY SUDDEN MOVES,

344
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,585
OR CROSS YOUR LEGS IN
SUCH A WAY THAT THE ANIMAL

345
00:16:28,618 --> 00:16:30,220
COULD MISTAKE YOU
FOR A CHICKEN.

346
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:33,924
OH, BOY.
EASY. EASY.

347
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:35,892
OH, BOY. OH, BOY.
EASY. OKAY, EASY.

348
00:16:35,926 --> 00:16:38,428
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOOD.
DON'T ANYBODY PANIC.

349
00:16:38,462 --> 00:16:40,063
OKAY, THERE YOU GO.

350
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,699
[laughter]

351
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:44,868
THAT'S A DOG, ED.

352
00:16:44,935 --> 00:16:47,571
IT'S A MEMBER OF
THE CANINE FAMILY, YES.

353
00:16:47,604 --> 00:16:50,140
THIS IS A
FOX TERRIER.

354
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:53,944
WELL, LET'S NOT ARGUE
ABOUT SEMANTICS, RED.

355
00:16:53,977 --> 00:16:55,612
YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE
BRINGING A FOX,

356
00:16:55,645 --> 00:16:56,913
AND YOU BRING ME
A FOX TERRIER?

357
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,248
WELL, THIS SHOULD
BE GOOD ENOUGH.

358
00:16:58,281 --> 00:17:00,550
I MEAN, IT'S GOT
THE WORD FOX IN IT.

359
00:17:00,617 --> 00:17:03,386
JUST USE YOUR IMAGINATION.

360
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,289
I'M PAYING YOU 100 BUCKS,
AND YOU BRING IN
A FOX TERRIER?

361
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:09,493
NO, YOU'RE PAYIN'
ME 200 BUCKS.

362
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:13,430
NO, I'M PAYIN' YOU 100 BUCKS.
JUST USE YOUR IMAGINATION.

363
00:17:17,868 --> 00:17:21,505
THE SMART HANDYMAN KNOWS
THAT YOUR BEST PROJECTS
ARE DONE ALONE.

364
00:17:21,538 --> 00:17:23,640
THAT WAY THERE'S NOBODY
THERE TRYING TO TELL YOU

365
00:17:23,707 --> 00:17:26,076
HOW STUPID OR
IMPOSSIBLE THEY ARE.

366
00:17:26,143 --> 00:17:27,944
UNFORTUNATELY...

367
00:17:31,481 --> 00:17:35,418
IT MEANS YOU HAVE TO DO ALL
THE HEAVY LIFTING BY YOURSELF.

368
00:17:35,485 --> 00:17:37,687
WHEN YOU WANNA TAKE
THE PROJECT INDOORS

369
00:17:37,754 --> 00:17:40,690
TO, SAY, THE DINING
ROOM TABLE,

370
00:17:40,757 --> 00:17:43,360
THERE'S NO ONE THERE TO
HOLD THE DOOR OPEN FOR YOU.

371
00:17:43,426 --> 00:17:45,996
WELL, HERE'S A
SIMPLE SOLUTION.

372
00:17:46,062 --> 00:17:50,333
MOUNT A ROPE FROM THE DOOR
INTO THE CHUCK OF YOUR
ELECTRIC DRILL.

373
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:52,602
THEN PLUG THE DRILL
INTO A MOTION DETECTOR.

374
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:55,238
THAT'S THE PART THAT'LL OPEN
THE DOOR WHEN IT SEES
YOU COMING.

375
00:17:55,272 --> 00:17:57,440
NOW, TO CLOSE THE DOOR,
TAKE THAT OLD THIGH MASTER

376
00:17:57,507 --> 00:17:59,709
FROM THE BOTTOM OF
YOUR WIFE'S TO DO LIST,

377
00:17:59,743 --> 00:18:02,779
AND HOOK THAT ON THERE AS YOUR
SPRING LOADED DOOR RETURN.

378
00:18:02,846 --> 00:18:05,248
AND SHE WORKS LIKE A CHARM.

379
00:18:05,282 --> 00:18:07,350
AS SOON AS I GET
PAST THE THRESHOLD,

380
00:18:07,384 --> 00:18:09,653
THE MOTION DETECTOR
SHUTS THE DRILL OFF,

381
00:18:09,686 --> 00:18:11,421
AND THE THIGH MASTER
CLOSES THE DOOR.

382
00:18:17,994 --> 00:18:19,462
OH, MAN.

383
00:18:25,235 --> 00:18:26,536
[applause]

384
00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:30,440
WE AT ROTHSCHILD'S SEWAGE
AND SEPTIC SUCKING SERVICES

385
00:18:30,473 --> 00:18:32,542
WOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU

386
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,412
IT'S CABBAGE SEASON.

387
00:18:35,478 --> 00:18:37,380
TIME TO PUT US ON
SPEED DIAL.

388
00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:48,792
WHERE DO YOU WANT ME TO PUT
THIS, MR. GHOSTBUSTER?

389
00:18:48,858 --> 00:18:50,760
RIGHT IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE ROOM.

390
00:18:50,827 --> 00:18:52,929
GHOSTS ALWAYS LIKE TO BE
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE ROOM

391
00:18:52,962 --> 00:18:55,432
SO THEY CAN SEE
ALL THE EXITS.

392
00:18:55,465 --> 00:18:57,801
CAN'T THEY FLOAT
THROUGH WALLS?

393
00:18:57,867 --> 00:19:00,370
UH, WELL, YEAH,
SOMETIMES.

394
00:19:00,403 --> 00:19:03,273
I MEAN, THERE'S DIFFERENT
LEVELS OF GHOST, YOU SEE.

395
00:19:03,306 --> 00:19:05,809
THEY'RE CALLED
DIFFERENT LEVELS.

396
00:19:05,842 --> 00:19:07,610
DIFFERENT LEVELS?

397
00:19:07,677 --> 00:19:09,612
YEAH, YEAH, EXACTLY.

398
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,348
LIKE, SOME GHOSTS
CAN WALK THROUGH WALLS;

399
00:19:12,415 --> 00:19:14,751
AND SOME GHOSTS
CAN GO THROUGH --

400
00:19:14,784 --> 00:19:16,886
MENOPAUSE?

401
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,789
ARE YOU GONNA BE
SERIOUS ABOUT THIS?

402
00:19:19,823 --> 00:19:22,725
YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE GOING THAT WAY, NO.

403
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:23,827
OPEN THE TRUNK.

404
00:19:23,893 --> 00:19:25,662
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GONNA GET
IN THERE, MIKE?

405
00:19:25,728 --> 00:19:30,266
NO, NO.
I'M GONNA DROP THE POSSUM
LAKE WIGGLER IN THERE.

406
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,569
THEN WHEN OUR
GUEST COMES ALONG,

407
00:19:32,602 --> 00:19:34,504
HE'LL GO INSIDE THERE.
I FLIP THE LID SHUT.

408
00:19:34,537 --> 00:19:36,406
WE GOT HIM.

409
00:19:36,472 --> 00:19:39,509
I MEAN, WHAT BETTER LURE
TO CATCH THE GHOST OF
HENRY THORKELSON

410
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:42,078
THAN THE ONE
HE INVENTED HIMSELF?

411
00:19:42,111 --> 00:19:43,947
THAT'S PRETTY
GOOD DETECTIVE WORK.

412
00:19:44,013 --> 00:19:45,949
OF COURSE, YOU'VE
MET SO MANY OF THEM,
HAVEN'T YOU, MIKE?

413
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,619
OKAY, YOU GOTTA BE QUIET.

414
00:19:49,652 --> 00:19:52,322
GO TURN OUT THE LIGHT,
AND FIND SOMEWHERE TO
SIT AND WAIT, OKAY?

415
00:19:52,355 --> 00:19:53,823
WHY DO I HAVE
TO BE QUIET?

416
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,758
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO SPOOK A GHOST.

417
00:19:55,792 --> 00:19:58,962
WE DON'T WANT HIM
TO NOTICE US.

418
00:19:58,995 --> 00:20:01,597
NOTICE US?
HOW STUPID IS THIS GUY?

419
00:20:02,632 --> 00:20:05,568
WELL, HE WAS A
LODGE MEMBER.

420
00:20:05,635 --> 00:20:07,670
ALL RIGHT, FAIR ENOUGH.

421
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:14,978
BOY, IT'S GETTING COLD
IN HERE, ISN'T IT?

422
00:20:17,747 --> 00:20:20,116
HERE IT IS!
OH, BOY.

423
00:20:20,183 --> 00:20:21,851
audience: OOOH!

424
00:20:21,918 --> 00:20:23,686
WHERE'S HE GOING?
WHERE'S HE GOING?

425
00:20:23,753 --> 00:20:26,489
OH, THERE HE IS!
OVER TO THE TRUNK!

426
00:20:26,556 --> 00:20:28,157
GO GET HIM!
GET HIM! GET HIM!

427
00:20:28,191 --> 00:20:29,726
GET HIM!
GET HIM!

428
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:32,061
GOT HIM!

429
00:20:32,128 --> 00:20:34,297
WAY TO GO, MIKE.

430
00:20:35,898 --> 00:20:39,535
[screaming]

431
00:20:39,602 --> 00:20:41,337
GET OFF!

432
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:51,047
[possum squealing]

433
00:20:51,114 --> 00:20:52,949
NOT WITHOUT ME!
MEETING TIME.

434
00:20:56,752 --> 00:20:58,888
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT
HOME AFTER THE MEETING.

435
00:20:58,921 --> 00:21:00,556
AND I DON'T CARE WHATEVER
I'VE SAID IN THE PAST,

436
00:21:00,623 --> 00:21:02,191
I LIKE ALL OF YOUR RELATIVES
THAT HAVE EVER BEEN BORN

437
00:21:02,258 --> 00:21:03,659
SINCE THE
BEGINNING OF TIME.

438
00:21:03,693 --> 00:21:04,894
AND TO THE
REST OF YOU,

439
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:06,062
THANKS VERY MUCH
FOR WATCHING.

440
00:21:06,095 --> 00:21:07,296
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND HENRY THORKELSON

441
00:21:07,363 --> 00:21:08,598
AND THE WHOLE GANG UP
HERE AT POSSUM LODGE,

442
00:21:08,631 --> 00:21:09,632
KEEP YOUR STICK
ON THE ICE.

443
00:21:09,699 --> 00:21:13,336
[cheering and applause]

444
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:14,937
COME ON IN HERE AND SIT DOWN.

445
00:21:15,004 --> 00:21:17,273
COME ON.
COME ON IN.
HAVE A SEAT.

446
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,708
MEETING COMING
TO ORDER HERE.

447
00:21:18,741 --> 00:21:20,109
SIT DOWN.
EVERYBODY SIT DOWN.

448
00:21:20,176 --> 00:21:21,410
SIT DOWN.
SIT DOWN.

449
00:21:22,311 --> 00:21:23,579
ALL RISE!

450
00:21:26,048 --> 00:21:28,851
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI.

451
00:21:28,885 --> 00:21:31,053
Red: SIT DOWN.

452
00:21:31,354 --> 00:21:33,823
ALL RIGHT, BOW YOUR HEADS
FOR THE MEN'S PRAYER.

453
00:21:34,156 --> 00:21:36,525
I'M A MAN,
BUT I CAN CHANGE,
