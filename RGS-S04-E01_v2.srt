00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:03,703
ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN

2
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:06,272
IS THAT MEN FEEL THEY
HAVE TO DOMINATE THINGS.

00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:09,943
IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO ENJOY
NATURE OR A JOB OR EVEN
A CONVERSATION.

I THINK THAT'S WHY
WE EAT SO MUCH MEAT.

FOR YOU, MAN AGAINST ANIMAL,

IT'S NOT SMART

YOU HIT THE ROAD."

THE OLDEST FARMER IN

HE WAS A VERY
COLOURFUL CHARACTER.

WAS A LOT FRIENDLIER
THAN HE SEEMED

52

BECAUSE HE WOULD
STAND THERE ON

BE GROUCHY.

HE GOT HIS NAME, GROUCHY.

61

AND THE STRANGE
THING IS...

62
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,564
THAT WHEN GROUCHY DIED,
HE WAS VERY, VERY RICH,

63

AND THERE'S NOW NO
FRIENDS AND NO RELATIVES
TO GET THE INHERITANCE.

FOR EXAMPLE, THESE

WHAT THEY WILL SAY TO US
IS THAT EVERY ONCE

NOW WE'RE ABOUT TO CROSS
THE LINE BETWEEN BEING
AN ARTISAN

AND BEING A HANDYMAN,

136
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:35,200
BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU,
THIS PROJECT REQUIRES
AS MUCH TASTE

137
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,103
AND ARTISTIC ABILITY AS
IT DOES A BIG HAMMER

138
00:05:38,103 --> 00:05:40,439
AND THE ATTITUDE TO
MAKE IT EFFECTIVE.

139
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:43,442
AND THE THING WITH ART IS
THERE'S NO RIGHT WAY

140
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:46,345
AND NO WRONG WAY.

[ EXPLOSION ]

142
00:05:48,814 --> 00:05:53,519
ALL RIGHT, MAYBE THERE
STILL IS A WRONG WAY.

143
00:05:55,587 --> 00:05:58,791
I DECIDED TO GO INSTEAD
WITH THE HANDYMAN SECRET
WEAPON, DUCT TAPE.

144
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,360

THE DAMAGE TO THAT

IT WAS A RENTAL.

146
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:06,498
SO NOW WHAT WE HAVE IS
NOT ONLY AN ATTRACTIVE
ART DECO HEADSTONE,

147
00:06:06,498 --> 00:06:08,367
IT'S ALSO EXTREMELY
FUNCTIONAL.

148
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:11,403
FOR EXAMPLE, I'VE INSTALLED
THE TURN SIGNALS

CHRISTMAS LIGHTS THERE

00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,607
AND SO NOW THE DECEASED
CAN SIGNAL HIS TURN,

151
00:06:15,607 --> 00:06:20,112
RIGHT OR LEFT,

152
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:21,880
UP OR DOWN, YOU KNOW.

153
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,415
BUT WITH GROUCHY I
THINK WHAT I'LL DO

154
00:06:23,415 --> 00:06:27,119
IS PUT THE FOUR-WAY
FLASHERS ON TO KEEP
HIS OPTIONS OPEN.

155
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:31,657
ACTUALLY WHERE HE'S GOING
HE'S GOING TO WISH I PUT
IN AIR CONDITIONING.

156
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:34,326
MAYBE THE LUCKY DICE WILL
MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE.

157
00:06:34,326 --> 00:06:36,295
YOU KNOW WHEN SOMEBODY
FAMOUS DIES

158
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,664
LIKE A PRESIDENT OR
ELVIS OR SOMETHING,

159
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,132
THEY ALWAYS HAVE
THE ETERNAL FLAME,

160
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:43,502
SO WHAT I'VE DONE IS I'VE
TAKEN THE GAS TANK OUT
OF GROUCHY'S CAR

161
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:47,139
AND WE'LL JUST
FIRE THAT UP.

162
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,109
BOY THAT SMELLS BAD.
THERE WE GO.

163
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:52,411
THERE'S YOUR FLAME.

164
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:55,547
THE ETERNAL PART WILL
DEPEND ON HIS GAS MILEAGE.

165
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:58,016
AND ALSO I PUT AN
ASHTRAY IN HERE

166
00:06:58,016 --> 00:07:00,619
JUST IN CASE GROUCHY
GETS HIMSELF CREMATED.

167
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:02,321
AND I'VE HOOKED UP THE
WINDSHIELD WASHER,

168
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:03,922
DOWN THROUGH THIS
GAS NOZZLE,

169
00:07:03,922 --> 00:07:06,692
THEY GO INTO HERE AND
SO ON AND GO DOWN AND
WATER THAT PLANT,

170
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,327
BECAUSE I FIGURE GROUCHY
PROBABLY IS NOT GOING

171
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,262
TO GET A LOT OF FLOWERS
WITH HIS PERSONALITY.

172
00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:12,898
LET'S SEE HOW THAT WORKS.

173
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:15,367
THERE WE GO.

174
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:18,470
BOY, THAT BRINGS ON A LOT
OF FEELINGS FOR ME,
HOW ABOUT YOU?

175
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,172
ANYWAY, THERE'S THE KIND
OF THING THAT YOU CAN DO

176
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:24,076
THE NEXT TIME SOME DISTANT,
FAR AWAY DISTANT RELATIVE
OF YOURS PASSES AWAY.

177
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:27,045
UNTIL THEN REMEMBER,
IF WOMEN DON'T FIND
YOU HANDSOME,

178
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:29,715
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

179
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,483
HONK IF YOU LOVE
INHERITANCES.

180
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:33,618
[ CAR HORN HONKS ]

181
00:07:33,618 --> 00:07:36,021
SPEAKING OF HONKING,
STAY TUNED FOR DAVE THOMAS,

182
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:39,491
AND WE'LL CHECK OUT AND
SEE HOW BILL'S DOING
IN THE SMOKE HOUSE.

183
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,398
I WANT TO TALK TO ALL
YOU MIDDLE-AGE GUYS

184
00:07:46,398 --> 00:07:49,267
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

185
00:07:49,267 --> 00:07:50,902
I'M ONE OF YOU.

186
00:07:50,902 --> 00:07:52,838
AND EVERY WEEK MORE AND
MORE OF US ARE COMING

187
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:56,575
OUT OF THE TOOL ROOM
AND ADMITTING IT.

188
00:07:56,575 --> 00:08:03,748
ADMITTING THAT WE HAVE
NOTHING TO SAY TO ANYONE
ABOUT ANYTHING.

189
00:08:03,748 --> 00:08:06,284
I KNOW THAT FEELING,
YOUR WIFE PROBABLY
UNDERSTANDS.

190
00:08:06,284 --> 00:08:08,653
YOU'VE SAID IT ALL TO
HER BEFORE, YOU'RE
STILL WITH HER,

191
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:11,756
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO ADD.

192
00:08:11,756 --> 00:08:13,758
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

193
00:08:13,758 --> 00:08:19,464
UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE
SOME GUYS WHO HAVE NOTHING
TO SAY BUT KEEP TALKING.

194
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:22,033
IF YOU FIND YOURSELF
RANTING ABOUT HOW PEOPLE

195
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:24,169
ARE PARKING THEIR CARS
ON YOUR STREET,

196
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:27,839
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO
SAY, STOP TALKING.

197
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,875
IF YOU FIND YOURSELF
GOING ON AND ON ABOUT

198
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:33,712
HOW JEOPARDY IS WAY BETTER
THAN WHEEL OF FORTUNE

199
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:37,148
OR HOW HARD THESE NEW
ORANGE JUICE CANS
ARE TO OPEN

200
00:08:37,148 --> 00:08:41,620
OR THE HIGH PRICE OF
HAMMERS, YOU HAVE
NOTHING TO SAY.

201
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,488
IF YOU FIND YOURSELF
TELLING A HILARIOUS STORY

202
00:08:43,488 --> 00:08:48,159
THAT YOU READ IN
READER'S DIGEST,
STOP TALKING.

203
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:50,161
NO ONE IS
LISTENING TO YOU.

204
00:08:50,161 --> 00:08:52,230
THE PERSON YOU'RE TALKING
TO HAS GLAZED OVER

205
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:56,034
AND IS NODDING THEIR
HEAD WHILE THEY MAKE
UP A GROCERY LIST

206
00:08:56,034 --> 00:08:58,103
OR PLAN THEIR
WINTER VACATION

207
00:08:58,103 --> 00:09:02,741
OR VOW NEVER TO GET AS
OLD AND BORING AS YOU ARE.

208
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:07,479
SO DON'T JUST KEEP
TALKING UNTIL YOU THINK
OF SOMETHING, YOU MAY NOT.

209
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:09,881
REMEMBER, I'M
PULLING FOR YOU.

210
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:13,184
WE'RE ALL IN
THIS TOGETHER.

211

214
00:09:27,298 --> 00:09:30,001
WELL, WE HAD THE READING
OF GROUCHY RADCLIFF'S WILL.

215
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:32,404
JUNIOR SINGLETON WAS
REAL EXCITED BECAUSE
THE LAWYER HAD CALLED HIM

216
00:09:32,404 --> 00:09:34,572
AND TOLD HIM SPECIFICALLY
TO GET DOWN THERE.

217
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:38,276
I'LL TELL YOU, JUNIOR HAD
DOLLAR SIGNS DANCING
IN HIS HEAD.

218
00:09:38,276 --> 00:09:41,479
SOMETHING TELLS ME THOSE
DOLLARS DIDN'T DANCE
INTO HIS WALLET.

219
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:43,848
WELL, BEING OF SOUND
MIND AND BODY,

220
00:09:43,848 --> 00:09:48,887
GROUCHY BEQUEATHED HIS FARM
AND ALL HIS PROPERTIES
AND ALL HIS INVESTMENTS

221
00:09:48,887 --> 00:09:51,456
AND HIS DOMESTIC AND
INTERNATIONAL BANK
ACCOUNTS

222
00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:57,061
TO THE HARMONIOUS CHURCH
OF MARS UNDER AUSPICES OF
THE RIGHT REVEREND LARRY.

223
00:09:57,061 --> 00:09:58,663
OH MAN.

224
00:09:58,663 --> 00:10:00,632
HE DID REMEMBER US,
THOUGH, HAROLD.

225
00:10:00,632 --> 00:10:04,903
GROUCHY LEFT HIS ENTIRE
MANURE PILE TO
POSSUM LODGE.

226
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:07,071
SO WE DON'T COME OUT
OF IT EMPTY-HANDED.

227
00:10:07,071 --> 00:10:11,876
WE ARE THE HEIRS
OF MANURE.

228
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:14,412
HAVE YOU EVER SMELLED
THE AIR OF MANURE?

229
00:10:14,412 --> 00:10:16,781
SO DID JUNIOR INHERIT
ANYTHING FOR ALL
HIS EFFORTS?

230
00:10:16,781 --> 00:10:18,116
YES, SIR.
GROUCHY LEFT HIM
HIS PRIZE STEER,

231
00:10:18,116 --> 00:10:20,852
WANDA THE
WONDER COW.

232
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:22,453
AND I THINK JUNIOR
WAS PLEASED.

233
00:10:22,453 --> 00:10:25,657
HE HAD A ACCEPTANCE SPEECH,
WHICH HE YELLED FOR
SOME REASON.

234
00:10:25,657 --> 00:10:28,426
AND DURING THAT HE VOWED
TO MAKE THAT COW A
TRIBUTE TO GROUCHY

235
00:10:28,426 --> 00:10:33,231
BY HAVING IT BUTCHERED
AND EATEN BEFORE THE SUN
SET ON RADCLIFF'S GRAVE.

236
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:35,700
LET'S MEET
OUR CONTESTANTS.

237
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,102
OUR CONTESTANTS STARTING
ON THE FAR END IS
MY UNCLE RED

238
00:10:38,102 --> 00:10:41,039

AND HIS BROTHER BEN FRANKLIN.

239
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,009
9WELCOME TO THE SHOW

IMPRESSIONIST ARTIST,

242
00:10:49,547 --> 00:10:53,985
DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS,
POST FEMINIST POETRY,
I PICKED THAT ONE,

243
00:10:53,985 --> 00:10:57,789
PALINDROMES OR CARS.

244
00:10:57,789 --> 00:11:00,358
WELL, THAT POST FEMINIST
POETRY SOUNDS TEMPTING,

245
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:03,027
BUT I THINK I'LL GO
WITH THE CARS, HAROLD.

246
00:11:03,027 --> 00:11:04,295
ALRIGHTY, THEN.

247

IN THE FORM
OF AN ANSWER.
ALL RIGHT.

249
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:11,903
QUESTION ONE:
WHAT DRIVER SAFETY DEVICE
WAS MADE MANDATORY

250
00:11:11,903 --> 00:11:14,906
IN ALL PASSENGER
VEHICLES IN 1962?

251
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:24,515
[ LAUGHTER ]

252
00:11:31,522 --> 00:11:33,191
ANYONE AT ALL.

253

OH, BEN.
YES, BEN,

254
00:11:36,727 --> 00:11:38,663
WHAT MANDATORY
DRIVER SAFETY DEVICE

255
00:11:38,663 --> 00:11:42,099
WAS MADE MANDATORY
BECAUSE IT WAS
MANDATORY --

256
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:44,735
THEY INSISTED
UPON IT IN 1962?

257
00:11:44,735 --> 00:11:47,171
HE OPENED A NEW ROAD
TO LANDSCAPE PAINTING

258
00:11:47,171 --> 00:11:54,178
BY APPLYING SCIENTIFIC
PRINCIPLES DEDUCED FROM
THE LAWS OF LIGHT.

259
00:11:54,178 --> 00:11:55,379
NO.

260
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:56,948
CAN YOU REPEAT THE
QUESTION, HAROLD?

261
00:11:56,948 --> 00:11:58,349
MAY I?
YES.

262
00:11:58,349 --> 00:11:59,717
WHAT DRIVER SAFETY DEVICE
WAS MADE MANDATORY

263
00:11:59,717 --> 00:12:02,053
IN ALL PASSENGER
VEHICLES IN 1962?

264
00:12:02,053 --> 00:12:03,487
YES, DOUGIE?

265
00:12:03,487 --> 00:12:07,024
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
IT WOULD BE THE
FIRE RETARDANT,

266
00:12:07,024 --> 00:12:11,762
ASBESTOS-LINED FIRE SUIT.

267

THE REALLY BIG CAR.
NO!

270
00:12:21,038 --> 00:12:24,375
THE SEAT BELT.
SEAT BELTS WERE MADE
MANDATORY IN 1962.

271
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:28,346
OKAY.
NEVER THOUGHT
OF THAT ONE.

272
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:31,015
TIME FOR ANOTHER VISIT
WITH OUR PAL, RANGER GORD.

273
00:12:31,015 --> 00:12:33,184
HI RED.
HI HAROLD.
YEAH.

274
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:34,685
NICE TO SEE YOU UP
HERE AT THE FIRE TOWER.

275
00:12:34,685 --> 00:12:37,154
ALWAYS NICE TO SEE
YOUNG PEOPLE UP AT
THE FIRE TOWER.

276
00:12:37,154 --> 00:12:38,556
I'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR YOU.

277
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:39,957
WELL, WE CAN'T
STAY LONG, GORD,

278
00:12:39,957 --> 00:12:41,826
JUST CAME FOR THAT BOOK
THAT YOU SAID YOU
WOULD LEND ME.

279
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:43,861
OH, RIGHT.

280
00:12:43,861 --> 00:12:44,929
THERE YOU GO,
"FROM STEER TO STEAK

281

"THE DO IT YOURSELF
HOW TO SLAUGHTER BOOK."

282
00:12:46,964 --> 00:12:48,399
GREAT.
THAT'S TERRIFIC.

283
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,234
DO YOU WANT A COFFEE?
I KNEW YOU WERE COMING,
I MADE A POT.

284
00:12:50,234 --> 00:12:52,103
IT WILL ONLY TAKE ME ABOUT
15 MINUTES TO RUN UP TO
THE TOP TO GET YOU A CUP.

285
00:12:52,103 --> 00:12:53,204
NO, NO, NO, NO, GORD.
NO, NO.

286
00:12:53,204 --> 00:12:54,839
COME ON BACK.

00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:55,840
COME ON.
COME ON.

288
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,341
I'M NOT GOING TO
INTERRUPT YOU FOR
THAT LONG.

289
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:59,910
I SEE THAT YOU'RE IN
THE MIDDLE OF RESEARCHING
SOMETHING IMPORTANT HERE.

290
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,513
OH, YEAH, I'M LOOKING
FOR A PET, RED.

291
00:13:02,513 --> 00:13:04,315
OH, BOY.
YOU'RE GOING TO TRY
AGAIN ARE YOU GORD?

292
00:13:04,315 --> 00:13:05,416
OH SURE, YEAH.

293
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,852
THERE MUST BE A PET
FOR ME OUT THERE
SOMEWHERE.

294
00:13:07,852 --> 00:13:09,954
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY
DOG YOU GET RUNS
AWAY ON YOU.

295
00:13:09,954 --> 00:13:12,923

GO FAR, HE WAS BLIND.

YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU NEED, GORD,

303
00:13:25,336 --> 00:13:27,438
YOU NEED AN ANIMAL THAT
DOESN'T MOVE, LIKE MAYBE

WITH BILL

A LOT OF THE CORPORATIONS
AND SO FORTH

00:15:33,997 --> 00:15:37,301
ARE HAVING THE EXERCISE

A STRESS THERAPY THING.

AND YOU GET ON --
YOU JUST GET ON THERE
LIKE THAT I GUESS.

I GUESS BILL HAS THE
PROFESSIONAL TECHNIQUE.

I JUST KIND OF --
YOU KNOW I'M JUST AN
AMATEUR AT THESE THINGS.

356
00:15:44,808 --> 00:15:46,944
THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING
MOUNT YOU GOT THERE, BILL.

357
00:15:46,944 --> 00:15:48,779
ANYWAY, UP HE COMES.

358
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:52,015
NOW, THE BEAUTY OF THIS
IS APPARENTLY THE MORE
YOU BOUNCE AND JUMP

359
00:15:52,015 --> 00:15:54,351
THEN THE MORE STRESS
IS RELIEVED FROM YOU.

360
00:15:54,351 --> 00:15:57,521
AND, OF COURSE, I DON'T
THINK YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO LEAVE YOUR SHOES

00:15:57,521 --> 00:15:59,389
RIGHT ON THE
EDGE LIKE THAT.

362
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:02,259
THAT TO ME IS NOT RELIEVING
ALL THAT MUCH STRESS
AT THIS POINT

363
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:05,329
SO I'M SAYING I'VE HAD
ABOUT AS MUCH STRESS
TAKEN OUT OF ME

364
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:07,764
AS I REALLY CAN STAND
AND STILL BE ALIVE

SO I WILL JUST
LET BILL DO IT.

366
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:11,501
AND BILL SEEMS PRETTY
STRESSED TO ME,

367
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:15,038
SO I'M THINKING PROBABLY
THE BIGGER THE BOUNCE, THE
MORE STRESS RELEASE,

368
00:16:15,038 --> 00:16:16,707
THAT ONLY MAKES
SENSE TO ME.

369
00:16:16,707 --> 00:16:18,742

I'M PUTTING A LITTLE
EXTRA WEIGHT ON THERE

AND LOOK AT THE
FUN HE'S HAVING.

AND A WHEEL RIM, BILL,

HE'S GOT TWICE AS MUCH
LEG ROOM THERE,

391
00:17:26,843 --> 00:17:28,712
WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE THE COW
HAS TWICE AS MUCH LEGS.

OF MEAT WE'RE CUTTING.

THIS WEEK'S LETTER
GOES AS FOLLOWS:

412
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,303
DEAR EXPERTS, A LOT
OF MY ROOF SHINGLES ARE
CRACKING AND CURLING UP

413
00:18:27,303 --> 00:18:30,473
AND I'M HAVING TROUBLE
KEEPING THE PAINT ON THE
INSIDE AND OUTSIDE WALLS,

414
00:18:30,473 --> 00:18:32,409
NOT THAT MY WIFE
LIKED THE COLOUR ANYWAY.

415
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:34,744
CAN YOU TELL
ME WHAT TO DO?

416
00:18:34,744 --> 00:18:36,513
WELL, SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE
GOT WATER LEAKING IN

417
00:18:36,513 --> 00:18:39,349
THROUGH THE SHINGLES
IN YOUR ROOF.
I'LL SAY SO.

418
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:44,721
YOU KNOW, IF THIS GUY
IS FROM ALBERTA,
LIKE IT SOUNDED,

419
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:48,792
HE PROBABLY HEATS
HIS HOUSE WITH OIL.

420
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:52,362
SO WHAT I RECOMMEND
IS THAT YOU TAKE A
PIECE OF ROPE

421
00:18:52,362 --> 00:18:55,031
AND YOU PUT ONE END
OF THE ROPE IN
THE OIL TANK

422
00:18:55,031 --> 00:18:57,434
AND YOU THREAD THE
OTHER END OF THE
ROPE OUT

423
00:18:57,434 --> 00:18:59,402
THROUGH THE BASEMENT WINDOW.

424
00:18:59,402 --> 00:19:00,770
WHAT'S THE ROPE FOR?

425
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:04,240
THAT'S YOUR WICK.

426
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,010
YOU SEE, THEM 250-GALLON
TANKS OF OIL

427
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:10,046
ARE THE CHEAPEST DYNAMITE
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND.

428
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:12,048
KABOOM!

429
00:19:14,384 --> 00:19:16,886
YOU'RE GOING TO BLOW
THE GUY'S HOUSE UP JUST
BECAUSE HIS ROOF LEAKS?

430
00:19:16,886 --> 00:19:18,988
OH, IT'S GOT TO
BE DONE, HAROLD.
IT'S GOT TO BE DONE.

431
00:19:18,988 --> 00:19:22,692
ONCE YOU GET WATER
IN THE WALLS, YOU GET
MOLD, YOU GET FUNGUS.

432
00:19:22,692 --> 00:19:25,161
IF SOMEBODY WITH A
WOODEN LEG COMES
OVER TO VISIT

433
00:19:25,161 --> 00:19:28,131
AND CATCHES UP A
CASE OF DRY ROT,

434
00:19:28,131 --> 00:19:31,067
YOU'RE LOOKING
AT A LAWSUIT.

435
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:32,735
YEAH, HAROLD, AND HE
ALREADY SAID HIS WIFE

436
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,237
DOESN'T LIKE THE
COLOUR OF THE HOUSE.

437
00:19:34,237 --> 00:19:37,473
ONCE YOU'RE INTO
THAT STUFF, IT'S EASIER
JUST TO FLATTEN THE PLACE.

438
00:19:37,473 --> 00:19:39,209
YEAH, IT'S LIKE
I ALWAYS SAID,

439
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:43,012
IT'S CHEAPER TO BUILD
A NEW HOME THAN IT IS
TO FIX THE OLD PLACE.

440
00:19:43,012 --> 00:19:44,814
AND THAT'S THE GREAT
THING ABOUT THE
