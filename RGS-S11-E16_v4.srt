1
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:04,637
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE
DISADVANTAGES OF LIVING IN A 
SMALL TOWN IN THE WINTER

2
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:07,941
IS YOU NEVER DRIVE FAR
ENOUGH FOR YOUR CAR
HEATER TO WARM UP.

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:11,644
IT ALMOST MAKES ME WISH
THEY'D MOVE THE BEER STORE
TO PORT ASBESTOS.

4
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:15,148
LUCKILY, THE HANDYMAN
ALWAYS HAS A SOLUTION.

5
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,783
RATHER THAN WASTING
A WHOLE BUNCH OF GAS

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,619
WARMING UP YOUR CAR HEATER,
I GOT A BETTER IDEA --

7
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:22,455
OR AT LEAST I SHOULD SAY
A CHEAPER IDEA.

8
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,624
I'VE LINED THE WHOLE
INSIDE OF MY COAT

9
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,593
WITH TOASTER ELEMENTS.

10
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:30,563
AND I'VE HOOKED UP THIS PLUG
THAT GOES RIGHT INTO THE
CIGARETTE LIGHTER.

11
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:35,335
SO IN ABOUT TEN SECONDS,

12
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,237
I'LL BE WARM AS TOAST.

13
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:40,807
YOU COULD LINE THE INSIDE OF
YOUR PANTS THE SAME WAY,

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,544
BUT INSTEAD OF A TOASTER
YOU SHOULD USE A BUN WARMER.

15
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:46,546
I RECOMMEND YOU
GIVE THIS A TRY.

16
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:49,082
I GUARANTEE YOU'LL BE
THE TOAST OF THE TOWN.

17
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,485
[timer bell rings]

18
00:00:56,156 --> 00:01:08,735
[cheers and applause]

19
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,869
ALL RIGHT

20
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:11,704
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

21
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,709
NO, NO. I APPRECIATE THAT.

22
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:18,778
WELL, I'VE HAD
A PLEASANT SURPRISE,

23
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,513
AND THAT DOESN'T
HAPPEN ALL THAT OFTEN

24
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,215
WHEN YOU'RE A MIDDLE-AGED
MAN IN A WORLD

25
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,385
RIDDLED WITH
FULL-LENGTH MIRRORS.

26
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:27,487
YOU KNOW, WHEN HAROLD
TOOK ON THE JOB

27
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,856
AS PUBLIC RELATIONS DIRECTOR
FOR THE POSSUM LAKE AREA,

28
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,424
I WAS AFRAID HE WAS
GOING TO WRECK THE LODGE

29
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,126
JUST SO PEOPLE
WOULD LIKE IT.

30
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,761
BUT HERE WE ARE
ALMOST A YEAR LATER,

31
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:36,729
AND HE REALLY HASN'T
CHANGED ANYTHING.

32
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,164
I MEAN, THAT SUITS ME FINE.

33
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:41,734
I FIND LIFE GOES BETTER WHEN
PEOPLE DON'T DO ANYTHING.

34
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,405
UNCLE RED, I HAVE SOMETHING
TO DISCUSS WITH YOU.

35
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,107
OKAY, THAT'S FINE,
HAROLD.

36
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:49,209
YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST
TELLING EVERYBODY
HOW PROUD I AM

37
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,610
OF HOW LITTLE
YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED.

38
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,179
[laughter]

39
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:55,215
OH, OH.

40
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,117
I APPRECIATE THAT.

41
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,819
OF COURSE, CITY COUNCIL HAS A
BIT OF A DIFFERENT TAKE ON IT.

42
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:03,289
OVERALL, MY DEPARTMENT IS
SHOWING A NET LOSS
OF $5,000.

43
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:05,425
OH, MAN, THAT'S
NOT BAD, HUH?

44
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,861
WELL, THEY WERE
HOPING FOR A PROFIT.

45
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,929
THEY HIRED ME AS
A REVENUE SOURCE,

46
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,598
SO THEY'RE
PRETTY DISAPPOINTED.

47
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,299
WELL, HAROLD, LIFE IS
ABOUT DISAPPOINTMENT.

48
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,869
YOU'D KNOW THAT
IF YOU WERE MARRIED.

49
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:18,037
WELL, NOW MY CONTRACT'S
UP FOR RENEWAL.

50
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:20,874
I HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO COVER
THE $5,000 SHORTFALL.

51
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:23,276
SO I'VE BOOKED
AN APPOINTMENT WITH
THE BANK MANAGER.

52
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,011
WELL, THERE YOU GO.

53
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,513
AND DON'T TAKE ANY
GUFF FROM HIM, HAROLD.

54
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,148
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
HE'S THERE TO LEND MONEY.

55
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:29,849
THAT'S HIS JOB,
OKAY.

56
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,217
AND THERE'S
OTHER BANKS.

57
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,019
LIKE, IF HE DOESN'T
OFFER YOU SOMETHING
YOU LIKE,

58
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,454
YOU JUST GIVE HIM THE
BIG ORANGE AND HIKE
IT ON OUTTA THERE.

59
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,722
OKAY! OKAY!

60
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,690
GOOD. GOOD.
'CAUSE I NEED
YOU TO GO WITH ME.

61
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:40,827
OH, NO, HAROLD, THAT GUY
SCARES THE CRAP OUTTA ME.

62
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,896
NO.
COME ON!

63
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:44,731
I'LL DO ALL
THE TALKING.

64
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:47,934
AND THE LODGE IS A
BIG PART OF THE PROBLEM.

65
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,470
SO I NEED YOU TO
WEAR THIS SPORTS COAT,

66
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,839
BECAUSE IT MAKES A BETTER
PROFESSIONAL IMPRESSION.

67
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,341
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
JUST TAKING THIS
TO THE CLEANERS.

68
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:56,976
ALL SET.
LET'S GO.

69
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,845
YOU WANT ME TO TAKE
IT TO THE CLEANERS
WHEN I'M DONE?

70
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,914
NO.
WHY ARE YOU SO
CONCERNED ABOUT MY JACKET?

71
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:01,948
WELL, EVERY TIME
I'VE BEEN TO THE BANK,

72
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:04,684
SOMEBODY ENDS UP
GOING TO THE CLEANERS.

73
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,160
IT'S TIME FOR THE
POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

74
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:23,836
[cheers and applause]

75
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:28,441
TODAY'S PRIZE IS A RIDE-ALONG
IN A POLICE CRUISER

76
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,910
WITH ONE OF
POSSUM LAKE'S FINEST.

77
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,513
EXPERIENCE THE THRILLS,
THE HIGH-SPEED CHASES,

78
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,449
THE DRIVE-BYS AND
THE DRIVE-THRUS.

79
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,251
THIS IS A GREAT PRIZE.

80
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,386
I'VE BEEN ON A COUPLE
OF THESE MYSELF.

81
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:42,455
OKAY, COVER YOUR THINGYS.

82
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,724
OKAY, MR. GREEN,
YOU'VE GOT 30 SECONDS

83
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,593
TO GET WINSTON
TO SAY THIS WORD...

84
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,161
DENIAL 

85
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,996
DENIAL 

86
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:50,396
ALL RIGHT, MIKE.

87
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:51,831
AND GO!

88
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:56,002
OKAY, WINSTON, THIS IS THE
OPPOSITE OF ADMISSION.

89
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,438
SUBTRACTION?

90
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:01,774
OKAY, SOMEONE WHO'S UNAWARE
OF THEIR OWN WEAKNESSES

91
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,644
OR SHORTCOMINGS
IS OBVIOUSLY IN...

92
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:07,280
POLITICS.

93
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,483
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

94
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,252
IF SOMEBODY IS OUTTA
TOUCH WITH REALITY,

95
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,953
THEY'RE EXPERIENCING...

96
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,589
A BEER BUZZ.

97
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,158
ALMOST OUTTA TIME,
MR. GREEN.

98
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,728
WINSTON, WHAT WAS THAT SLOGAN
YOU CAME UP WITH LAST WEEK?

99
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,563
REMEMBER YOU CAME UP
WITH THAT SLOGAN?

100
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,598
OH, YEAH, YEAH.
I LOVE SUCKING SEPTICS;

101
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,233
IT SUITS MY STYLE.

102
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,269
I'D RATHER BE IN SEWAGE
THAN LIVE IN DENIAL.

103
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,304
THERE WE GO,
BABY!

104
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,514
THIS IS THE REPAIR SHOP
PART OF THE SHOW WE CALL

105
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,317
IF IT AIN'T BROKE,
YOU'RE NOT TRYING.

106
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,985
JOINING ME TODAY,
DALTON HUMPHREY

107
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,487
OF HUMPHREY'S
EVERYTHING STORE.

108
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,055
YOU GOT ANY BARGAINS DOWN
AT THE STORE THERE, DALTON?

109
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,157
YOU BETCHA, RED.
YOU DROP BY BEFORE
NOON ON SATURDAY,

110
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,825
THE ADMISSION IS FREE.

111
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,231
DO YOU NORMALLY CHARGE
ADMISSION TO YOUR STORE?

112
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,732
IT'S NOT JUST A STORE, RED.

113
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,535
I KIND OF THINK OF IT
AS A THRIFT MUSEUM.

114
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:07,640
OH, YEAH, AND IS THIS AN
ARTEFACT FROM THE CHEAP
CRAP DISPLAY?

115
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,576
NO, NO, THAT'S MY
WIFE'S WAFFLE IRON.

116
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,546
I WAS WONDERING IF
YOU COULD HELP
ME CLEAN IT.

117
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:17,717
YOU MAKE WAFFLES OUT OF
PETROLEUM PRODUCTS,
DO YOU?

118
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,452
THERE'S SOME KIND OF
MELTED RUBBER ON HERE.

119
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,455
YEAH, RIGHT.
WELL, I WORE ALL THE
TREADS OFF MY WORK BOOTS,

120
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:26,392
AND I SAW THAT THE PATTERN
ON THIS WAFFLE IRON
WAS THE SAME,

121
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:29,095
SO I FIGURED I COULD --
YOU KNOW, I'D JUST --

122
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,198
START TO LIQUEFY
SOME NOXIOUS MATERIALS

123
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,767
IN YOUR KITCHEN TO SAVE
A FEW BUCKS, HUH?

124
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,337
BOY, I NEVER THOUGHT
OF IT THAT WAY.

125
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,972
GEE, I THOUGHT MAYBE
THE BUDGIE JUST DIED
OF OLD AGE.

126
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:46,379
WELL, I MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET
THAT OFF WITH A SCREW DRIVER.

127
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,381
HOW DID YOU WEAR THE
TREADS OFF YOUR
WORK BOOTS?

128
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,049
WELL, I FINALLY DECIDED
TO BUILD THAT GAZEBO

129
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:50,750
MY WIFE'S BEEN
ASKING FOR.

130
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,253
SO I HAD TO PICK UP ABOUT
A TONNE OF SHINGLES AND
LUMBER AND STUFF,

131
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,356
SO I JUST THREW IT ALL IN THE
BACK OF MY TRUCK, SEE?

132
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,824
OH, THAT OLD
PICK-UP TRUCK?

133
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,460
YOU FINALLY COUGHED
UP ENOUGH MONEY TO GET THE
BRAKES FIXED ON THAT YET?

134
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,863
NO, NO, THAT'S HOW I WORE
THE TREADS OFF MY SHOES.

135
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,666
SO CAN YOU HELP
ME CLEAN THIS UP?

136
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,635
YEAH, I THINK SHE'S
PRETTY GOOD RIGHT THERE.

137
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,204
OH, THAT'S GREAT.
I WISH I COULD PAY YOU.

138
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,905
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GIVE ME THE WAFFLE IRON?

139
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,907
NO, NO,
I NEED THIS.

140
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:17,477
I'M GONNA MAKE
SOME SNOW TIRES.

141
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,348
PEOPLE SOMETIMES
CALL ME A CHUMP.

142
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,484
THEY SAY I'M TOO
SMALL TO HANDLE A DUMP.

143
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,686
BUT I CAN SUCK UP
ANY SIZE LUMP.

144
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,388
IT'S NOT THE LENGTH
OF THE HOSE,

145
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,989
IT'S THE STRENGTH
OF THE PUMP.

146
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,002
DON'T YOU HATE
DRIVING IN WINTER

147
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,872
WHEN YOUR TIRES
JUST SIT THERE AND SPIN?

148
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,207
OH, SURE, IT'S OKAY IF YOU'RE
JUST DRIVING TO SCHOOL
OR WORK;

149
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,743
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,
IT CAN BE A REAL PAIN.

150
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,678
SO THIS TIME ON
HANDYMAN CORNER,

151
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,781
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU HOW
YOU CAN CONVERT YOUR CAR

152
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:57,383
INTO A GO-ANYWHERE
WINTER VEHICLE.

153
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,585
FIRST THING WE GOTTA DO IS
INCREASE THE TRACTION

154
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,421
ON THE BACK WHEELS.

155
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,790
TO DO THAT YOU'RE
GONNA NEED A MAN'S BELT

156
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:07,427
MADE OUT OF LEATHER AND BIG
ENOUGH TO GO ALL THE WAY
AROUND TIRE.

157
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,195
IF YOU'RE A
MATH WHIZ, NOW,

158
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,897
WHAT YOU DO IS
MEASURE THE DIAMETER

159
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,899
AND MULTIPLY THAT BY PI.

160
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:17,336
OR YOU COULD JUST GET
YOURSELF A COUPLE OF MOOSE
THOMPSON'S BELTS.

161
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,505
THEY'RE USED TO
BEING AROUND A TIRE,

162
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,808
AND I'M SURE PIE
WAS INVOLVED.

163
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,443
NOW, BEFORE WE MOUNT
THE BELTS ONTO THE WHEELS,

164
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,610
WE NEED TO ADD
SOMETHING TO THEM

165
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,046
TO GIVE US A LOT
MORE TRACTION.

166
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:29,449
I SUGGEST CUTLERY.

167
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:32,118
YOU PROBABLY HAVE A BUNCH
OF OLD, USED CUTLERY
AROUND YOUR HOUSE.

168
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,086
WE'RE NOT THAT
LUCKY AT THE LODGE.

169
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,254
WE HAVE LOTS OF
OLD CUTLERY,

170
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:37,323
BUT HARDLY ANY OF
IT IS USED.

171
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,129
NOW, YOU'LL NOTICE I ATTACHED
ALL THE CUTLERY ON THERE

172
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,765
USING THE HANDYMAN'S
SECRET WEAPON, DUCT TAPE.

173
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:48,668
NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS REPLACE THE STANDARD
WHEELS WITH THESE BABIES,

174
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,169
AND I'M GOOD TO GO.

175
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,952
AND IT'S JUST THAT EASY.

176
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,453
NOW YOU'LL BE
ABLE TO GO ANYWHERE,

177
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:08,921
EVEN IF THERE'S A
FORK IN THE ROAD.

178
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,656
GET IT?

179
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,391
OH, AND TAKE A
LOOK AT THIS.

180
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,594
TO MAKE SURE THE FRONT WHEELS
GLIDE ALONG SMOOTHLY,

181
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,330
I FOUND A GREAT USE
FOR THOSE OLD TOBOGGANS.

182
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,501
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

183
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,036
THEY SHOULD AT
LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

184
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:45,291
LOTS OF CRAZY STUFF HAPPENING
ON THE ROADS THESE DAYS.

185
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,493
I MEAN, YOU SEE
THE ADS ON TV,

186
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:52,331
WHERE THEY GOT SOME YUPPIE,
WEENIE IN A HIGH-PRICED
STATUS-MOBILE

187
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,934
SLIDING INTO A CORNER IN A
FOUR-WHEEL DRIFT,

188
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,636
GOING ABOUT 130.

189
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,171
YOU THINK TO YOURSELF,
NOW, WHO WOULD BE STUPID
ENOUGH TO TRY THAT?

190
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:02,108
YOU GO OUT ON THE HIGHWAY,
THERE'S YOUR ANSWER.

191
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:04,911
I MEAN, THESE GUYS, THEY'RE
DIPSY-DOODLING THROUGH
THE TRAFFIC

192
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,979
DOING TWICE THE
SPEED OF SENSE,

193
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,850
TURNING YOUR RELAXING DRIVE
INTO A TEETH GRINDER.

194
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,653
YOU KNOW WHAT THESE GOOFS ARE
SAYING MORE OR LESS IS,

195
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,855
HEY, OUT OF THE WAY, SUCKER.

196
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,823
MAKE ROOM FOR
THE BIG FISH, HUH?

197
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,359
I KNOW THE NORMAL REACTION
IS TO TEACH THEM A LESSON

198
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:23,529
BY DRIVING LIKE
AN IDIOT YOURSELF.

199
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:26,599
BUT YOU MIGHT WANNA
THINK THAT ONE OVER.

200
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:29,502
YOU KNOW, AT THAT SPEED,
THE ROAD'LL BE GOING
BY PRETTY FAST

201
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:33,172
WHEN YOU LOOK DOWN THROUGH
THE BOARDS OF YOUR K-CAR.

202
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,108
SO INSTEAD, I SAY,
JUST SLOW DOWN.

203
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:37,810
THINK ABOUT THE TRUTH.

204
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,946
THAT GUY THAT
JUST BLEW PAST YOU

205
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:43,249
IS TRYING TO MAKE PAYMENTS
ON A $60,000 CAR.

206
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:46,052
AND HE'S GOT TO GET TO WORK
EARLY SO HE CAN GET
A PROMOTION

207
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,989
SO THAT NEXT YEAR HE CAN MAKE
PAYMENTS ON AN $80,000 CAR.

208
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:53,292
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE HE'S
TREADING WATER IN A SAUCEPAN.

209
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:57,129
HE'S NOT GONNA DROWN,
BUT HE'S STILL COOKED.

210
00:09:57,196 --> 00:10:01,000
WHEREAS YOU, MY FRIEND,
HAVE THE SWEET LIFE.

211
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:05,271
IF YOU'RE LATE FOR WORK
NOBODY CARES.

212
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,440
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
RISK YOUR LIFE.

213
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,141
DO YOU SEE A PROMOTION
COMING YOUR WAY?

214
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,043
NO CHANCE!

215
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,879
SO YOU JUST SIT BACK,
TURN UP THE RADIO,

216
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,748
IF IT STILL WORKS.

217
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,985
DON'T THE LET THE BIG FISH IN
THE SMALL CAR BOTHER YOU.

218
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,721
RIGHT NOW HE'S JUST
THE ONE WHO GOT AWAY.

219
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:25,324
BUT IN THE LONG RUN, YOU'RE
THE ONE WHO GOT YOUR WAY.

220
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:26,659
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

221
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,394
WE'RE ALL IN
THIS TOGETHER.

222
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:32,665
[applause]

223
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,501
IF YOUR HOME HAS STARTED TO
SMELL LIKE A BARN

224
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:38,304
AND YOU'RE 1,000 MILES
FROM THE NEAREST FARM,

225
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,973
CALL BEFORE THE STINK
DOES ANY MORE HARM.

226
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,242
DON'T WAIT TILL IT SETS
OFF THE SMOKE ALARM.

227
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,516
Dalton:
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

228
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,452
Red: YEAH, YOU WON'T SEE
ANOTHER ONE LIKE TODAY.

229
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,788
Mike:
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A DREAM,

230
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,424
EXCEPT FOR THE
SMELL OF THE LAKE.

231
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,660
Dalton:
MAYBE IT IS A DREAM.

232
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:03,295
Mike:
SAY, WHAT IS THAT
SMELL ANYWAY?

233
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,231
Red: WELL, IT'S
EITHER RAW SEWAGE

234
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,967
OR DEAD ALGAE
OR DALTON.

235
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,835
Dalton: YOU KNOW,
IT COULD BE A DREAM.

236
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,505
MAYBE I'M DREAMING
AND YOUR TWO AREN'T REAL.

237
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:15,508
Mike: OR MAYBE I'M DREAMING.
THIS COULD BE MY DREAM.

238
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,411
EXCEPT YOU GUYS WOULD
BE WEARING DRESSES.

239
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:20,279
Red:
WELL, IF IT WAS MY DREAM,

240
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:21,814
I'D HAVE CAUGHT
SOME FISH BY NOW,

241
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,716
AND I WOULDN'T
HAVE YOU TWO.

242
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,819
I'D HAVE HARPO MARX
AND MARCEL MARCEAU HERE.

243
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,756
Mike: I THINK HE WANTS
US TO BE QUIET.

244
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,025
Dalton: I SENSED THAT.

245
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,628
Mike: WHAT DO YOU
DREAM ABOUT, MR. GREEN?

246
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:38,264
Red: A PERFECT WORLD, MIKE,
WHERE NOBODY BOTHERS ME.

247
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,832
Dalton: AMEN.

248
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,201
Mike: BUT FOR NOBODY
TO BOTHER YOU,

249
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,703
YOU'D HAVE TO BE ALONE.

250
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,639
Dalton: WELL, SOMETIMES
A MAN NEEDS TO BE ALONE, MIKE.

251
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:48,974
Mike: I KNOW.
IT'S CALLED SOLITARY.

252
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:52,411
I JUST NEVER HEARD OF ANYBODY
DREAMING ABOUT IT BEFORE.

253
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,914
Red: WELL, NO, WE DON'T WANT
TO BE ALONE ALL THE TIME,

254
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:56,649
JUST SOME OF THE TIME.

255
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:59,518
Dalton: A LOT OF THE TIME.
MOST OF THE TIME.

256
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:02,088
Mike: NOT ME.
I LIKE TO BE WITH PEOPLE,

257
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:05,124
INTERACTING, SHARING.

258
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,226
Red: YOU KNOW, MIKE, WHEN
YOU STEAL A PERSON'S WATCH,

259
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,695
THAT'S NOT CALLED SHARING.

260
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,231
Mike: THAT'S BEEN
A HARSH LESSON FOR ME.

261
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,133
Red: YEAH.

262
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,536
[applause]

263
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,707
OKAY, SO WE GO
DOWN TO THE BANK

264
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:24,477
TO BORROW THE 5,000
AND I WAS ASKED
TO BE THERE.

265
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,812
THEN I WAS TOLD TO SIT
QUIETLY AND KEEP MY
MOUTH SHUT.

266
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:27,646
THAT'S WHAT YOU
TOLD ME, RIGHT?

267
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,115
EVERYONE IN THE
BANK TOLD YOU.

268
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,382
OKAY,
THAT'S FINE.

269
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:33,252
SO I'M SITTING THERE
WAITING FOR HAROLD
TRUMP HERE

270
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,221
TO ASK FOR THE 5,000.

271
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,455
YOU CAN'T JUST
BORROW MONEY.

272
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:37,690
YOU HAVE TO HAVE
A BUSINESS PLAN.

273
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,192
NO YOU DON'T. I'VE NEVER HAD A
BUSINESS PLAN.

274
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,428
YOU NEVER
RAN A BUSINESS.

275
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,029
WELL, THIS IS A
LODGE, HAROLD.

276
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,397
THIS IS FOR THE ENJOYMENT
OF PEOPLE LIKE ME.

277
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:46,799
IT'S NOT ABOUT
MAKING MONEY.

278
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,901
AND IT'S MY JOB
TO CHANGE THAT.

279
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,069
I LIKE MY JOB.

280
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:51,837
I DON'T WANNA LOSE IT
AND HAVE TO MOVE AWAY AGAIN.

281
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,239
THAT'S WHY I MADE
THE PROPOSAL.

282
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,240
OH, BOY, YOU SHOULD'VE
HEARD THIS.

283
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,376
HE SAYS WE WANNA MAKE ALL
KINDS OF IMPROVEMENTS
TO THE LODGE

284
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:00,346
SO IT'LL ATTRACT TOURISTS
TO COME UP FROM THE CITY.
WHO WANTS THAT?

285
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:03,182
WELL, WE HAVE A FINANCIAL
PROBLEM, UNCLE RED.

286
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:06,118
WELL, OKAY, WE HAVE A
$5,000 PROBLEM, HAROLD.

287
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:07,620
WHY CAN'T WE JUST BORROW
AGAINST THE LODGE.

288
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,555
IT'S GOTTA BE WORTH
AT LEAST FIVE GRAND.

289
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:12,391
WELL, I'D SAY CLOSER TO 200.

290
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,659
REALLY?
200,000?

291
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,261
NO
$200?

292
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,630
THAT'S THE ONE.

293
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,298
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, HAROLD?

294
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,101
I MEAN, THE LAND ALONE HAS
GOT TO BE WORTH 50,000.

295
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,670
YOU DON'T OWN
THE LAND, THE BANK DOES.

296
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,106
WELL, THEN WHAT ARE
THEY WORRIED ABOUT?

297
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,944
THAT DOESN'T EVEN
MAKE SENSE.

298
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:32,711
UNCLE RED, THE ONLY
WAY OUT OF THIS IS

299
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:34,079
WE HAVE TO MAKE
MAJOR RENOVATIONS

300
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,815
AND THEN THE LODGE CAN
BECOME A PROFIT CENTRE.

301
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,317
OH, YEAH.
YOU SHOULD'VE
HEARD THIS ONE.

302
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:42,087
HE HITS THE BANK UP
FOR TWO MILLION BUCKS!

303
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:44,123
I MEAN, IT WAS THE MOST
INSANE THING I EVER HEARD.

304
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,357
AND THEN THE BANK
MANAGER TOPS HIM

305
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,426
BY SAYING YES.

306
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,462
WELL, HE KNOWS A GOOD
INVESTMENT WHEN
HE SEES ONE.

307
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,363
HAROLD, THAT'S NOT
A GOOD INVESTMENT;

308
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:52,264
THAT'S INSANITY.

309
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,366
YOU DON'T TAKE ON A
$2 MILLION DEBT

310
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,969
TO SOLVE A $5,000 PROBLEM.

311
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,239
IT'S THE WAY THE
GOVERNMENT DOES IT.

312
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,175
[applause]

313
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:08,113
Red: MIKE AND I HAD KIND OF
AGREED TO MEET OUT BY
THE WOODS THERE

314
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,115
AND JUST GO HAVE
A LITTLE PICNIC.

315
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:13,118
AND MIKE PULLED UP
IN A CAR -- WOW!

316
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,654
THAT IS A NICE SET
OF WHEELS.

317
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,956
THAT YOUR CAR, MIKE?

318
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,824
OH, YEAH.
YEAH, YEAH, HE SAYS.

319
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:21,794
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
IT'S HIS CAR NOW, I GUESS.

320
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:26,532
I GOT A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS
WHEN HE COULDN'T FIGURE OUT
HOW TO OPEN THE TRUNK.

321
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,068
SO I SAID, THIS IS
ONE OF THESE FANCY --

322
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:32,137
IT'S THE REMOTE DEAL.
YOU PUSH THE LITTLE BUTTON
TO OPEN THE TRUNK.

323
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,106
FUNNY HE DIDN'T
KNOW THAT, EH,

324
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,542
WITH IT BEING HIS
CAR AND EVERYTHING?

325
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:37,776
SO HE HAD BROUGHT HIS
STUFF FOR THE PICNIC,

326
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:42,781
WHICH WAS ABOUT TEN OF THOSE
BOXES OF CANNED STEW.

327
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:43,782
I FIGURED ONE WOULD DO IT,

328
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:44,783
BUT HE WANTED
TO TAKE THEM ALL.

329
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,086
HE SAID HE NEEDED TO HIDE
THEM FOR A WHILE.

330
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,456
SO AS LONG AS HE'S CARRYING
THEM, I DIDN'T MIND.

331
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,925
AND HE ALSO HAD BROUGHT
A TWO-WHEEL DOLLY

332
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:53,959
THAT HAD KIND OF A
FRESH LOOK TO IT AS WELL.

333
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,562
BUT I DIDN'T
ASK ANY QUESTIONS.

334
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,365
SO, UH, AWAY WE
GO INTO THE WOODS.

335
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,100
THIS IS A GREAT DAY,
FANTASTIC DAY.

336
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,202
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL,
BEAUTIFUL DAY.

337
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,138
AND WE GOT IN THERE,
AND I GOTTA GIVE MIKE CREDIT.

338
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,107
THINGS GET TOUGH,
BUT HE DOESN'T QUIT.

339
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:11,944
HE FINDS A WAY TO GET THE JOB
DONE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

340
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,249
SO WE GOT THE FIRE GOING.

341
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,419
I WAS MAKING A HOT DOG,
BUT MIKE HAD NO CAN OPENER.

342
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,021
I DIDN'T HAVE
A CAN OPENER ON ME,

343
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:25,391
SO I SAID, MAYBE YOU
SHOULD GO BACK TO THE CAR.

344
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:26,258
AND SO HE'S GOING
TO GO BACK TO THE CAR,

345
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,294
AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO
BACK TO THE CAR,

346
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:32,097
YOU MIGHT AS WELL GO IN THE
DIRECTION THE CAR IS.

347
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,935
THAT COULD PROBABLY SPEED
THINGS UP SOMEWHAT.

348
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,937
AND SOMETHING HAPPENED HERE.

349
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:38,804
SOMETIMES YOU GET
INTO THE WOODS,

350
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,072
AND IF THERE'S
NOT A CLEAR TRAIL,

351
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,841
YOU END UP DOING
A U-TURN.

352
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:45,077
YOU KNOW, IT'S THE
KIND OF THING THAT
CAN HAPPEN TO ANYBODY,

353
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:48,314
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW HE ENDED
UP COMING IN THE WRONG WAY.

354
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,182
SO I SAID, MIKE,
YOU GO THAT WAY,

355
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,917
AND I'LL GO THE WAY
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GO

356
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:54,420
AND I'M SURE IT'S
GONNA WORK OUT FINE.

357
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,088
SO I COME DOWN
THROUGH THE WOODS,

358
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,390
AND LIKE I SAY,
IT COULD HAPPEN TO ANYBODY.

359
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:00,626
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
I COME BACK.

360
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,394
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M EVER
GONNA SEE MIKE AGAIN.

361
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:05,998
BUT OH, YEAH, THERE HE
IS EATING MY HOT DOG.

362
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:09,635
SO I FIGURE OKAY, WE NEED
TO ADD SOME TECHNOLOGY
INTO THIS MYSTERY,

363
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,904
SO I ASKED HIM FOR HIS
ITTLE REMOTE THING THERE,

364
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,405
AND I FIGURING IF I CAN
HONK THE CAR HORN --

365
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,408
WHEN YOU LOCK 'EM,
THE HORN HONKS ON THESE.

366
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,078
SO WE LISTENED FOR IT.
[ HORN HONKING ]

367
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:22,014
YEAH, SO WE JUST GOTTA
WALK THE WAY IT'S COMING.

368
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,350
NO, THAT'S NOT GONNA --
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

369
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,986
ALL RIGHT, IT'S ALSO GOT
THE REMOTE STARTER ON
THE BACK OF IT,

370
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,355
SO IF WE START HER UP,
AND IF SHE'S IN GEAR AT ALL,

371
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,557
SHE SHOULD START
DRIVING TOWARD US.

372
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:33,425
AND THAT WOULD BE A --
THE CAR SHOULD JUST COME --

373
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,794
OH, I DIDN'T SEE
THE TREE THERE.

374
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,930
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S --

375
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,832
OKAY, THERE'S GOING TO BE
SOME DAMAGE ON YOUR NEW --

376
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,333
OH!

377
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,069
THERE'S GONNA BE SOME DAMAGE,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT
WE DO NOW.

378
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,571
OH, WAIT A SECOND,
IF THE CAR HIT THE TREE,

379
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:50,442
IT MEANS THAT --
WELL, THIS IS A BRILLIANT
WAY TO FIND YOUR WAY HOME.

380
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,813
ALL YOU KIDS OUT THERE,
JUST FOLLOW THE TREE

381
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,049
THAT YOUR HOUSE
KNOCKED...  OVER...

382
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:00,552
AND YOU'LL GET BACK --
ANYWAY, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

383
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,255
IT WAS AS GREAT DAY,
AND MIKE'S CAR, I'M SURE,

384
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:05,491
WILL BE COVERED BY
SOMEBODY'S INSURANCE.

385
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:09,528
[applause]

386
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,701
WHEN YOUR SEPTICS
NEED CLEANING

387
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,569
BECAUSE THEY
SMELL UNKEMPT --

388
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,905
IT HAPPENS TO EVERYONE,
NO ONE'S EXEMPT,

389
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:21,373
CALL YOUR FRIENDS
AT ROTHSCHILD'S.

390
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,641
WE HOLD NO CONTEMPT.

391
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,276
WE'LL SUCK OUT YOUR SEWAGE

392
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,412
OR DIE IN THE ATTEMPT.

393
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,850
YOU KNOW, TO ME THE MARK
OF A TRUE HANDYMAN

394
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,086
IS TO BE ABLE TO SEE
WHAT SOMETHING DOES

395
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:37,222
AND THEN USE IT IN A
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
APPLICATION.

396
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,525
FOR EXAMPLE, THEY HAVE
THIS BUBBLY MEDICINE

397
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,527
FOR STOMACH ACHES
OR HEADACHES

398
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,163
OR DRY HEAVES
OR WHATEVER.

399
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,400
SEE THAT?
GOES NUTS WHEN
IT HITS THE WATER.

400
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,537
KIND OF LIKE A THREE-YEAR-OLD
AT AT WADING POOL

401
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,672
THAT'S POWER YOU'RE
LOOKING AT THERE.

402
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:57,176
AND I'M THINKING THERE'S
GOTTA BE A BETTER WAY OF
USING THAT POWER.

403
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:01,747
HOW ABOUT MAKING A
POWER CANOE?

404
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,449
JUST ATTACH A PIECE OF
DRAIN PIPE TO THE SIDE

405
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:06,652
AND RUN IT FROM ABOVE THE
GUNNELS DOWN INTO THE WATER.

406
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:07,886
MAKE SURE YOU
ATTACH IT LOOSE

407
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,989
SO THAT YOU'VE GOT
FORWARD AND REVERSE.

408
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:13,158
NOW YOU JUST POUR THE
MEDICINE DOWN THE PIPE.

409
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:16,161
IT HITS THE WATER COMING UP
AND THAT STARTS MAKING
THE POWER.

410
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:18,397
NOW ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS DIRECT THAT POWER

411
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,432
SO IT COMES OUT THE
BOTTOM OF THE PIPE.

412
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,768
THAT'S WHAT THIS
CORK IS FOR.

413
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,171
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GIVE HER A GO.

414
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,073
I'M JUST GONNA POUR
THE MEDICINE INTO THE HOLE.

415
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:30,275
THEN JAM THE CORK IN THERE
AND HANG ONTO THE PIPE.

416
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,311
OH, YEAH,
ONE MORE THING...

417
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,179
GO BIG OR GO HOME.

418
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:50,162
[cheers and applause]

419
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:52,931
WELL, I THINK I GOT THE
FINANCIAL PROBLEM SOLVED.

420
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,601
SEE, ALL WE REALLY
NEED IS $5,000.

421
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:58,537
NOW, OKAY, NONE OF THE POSSUM
LODGE MEMBERS HAVE THAT
KIND OF CASH,

422
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:01,340
BUT I FIGURED, HEY,
WHY DON'T WE POOL OUR MONEY?

423
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,608
OR MAYBE A BETTER
WAY TO SAY IT IS,

424
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,910
WHY DON'T WE PUDDLE
OUR MONEY?

425
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,346
SO I FIGURE IF I GET FIVE
GUYS TO EACH PUT UP 1,000 --

426
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:10,115
THAT'S TOO HIGH.
OKAY, 50,000 GUYS
AT A DIME EACH.

427
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:12,017
THAT'S GONNA TAKE FOREVER.

428
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:14,052
THEN I THINK, OKAY, 50 GUYS
AT 100 BUCKS A PIECE

429
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,822
AND THAT WORKS OUT TO --
WELL, CLOSE ENOUGH.

430
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,624
SO I GOT HER KNOCKED
RIGHT HERE.

431
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:19,625
UNCLE RED,
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

432
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,193
ABSOLUTELY HAROLD
I'VE GOT GREAT NEWS.

433
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:21,827
I'VE SOLVED
THE PROBLEM.

434
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,263
HERE'S A CHEQUE
FOR FIVE GRAND.

435
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,398
WOW!

436
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,034
I CAN'T ACCEPT THIS.

437
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,769
YOU CAN ACCEPT IT.
IT'S A LOAN.

438
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,371
AND TAKE YOUR TIME
PAYING IT BACK.

439
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,906
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.

440
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,174
NO, NO, IT'S NOT
A LODGE DEBT.

441
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,308
THIS IS A PERSONAL
PROBLEM.

442
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,876
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME
THAT I FIND A SOLUTION.

443
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,778
HAROLD, WE DON'T LIKE THE
SOLUTION, OKAY?

444
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,414
WE DON'T WANT THE LODGE TO
CHANGE, HAROLD, OKAY?

445
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:43,682
EVERYTHING IN
LIFE CHANGES;

446
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,351
WE NEED THE LODGE TO
STAY EXACTLY THE
WAY IT IS.

447
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,619
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

448
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,387
YOU UNDERSTAND IT?

449
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:51,757
YOU BORROWED TWO MILLION
BUCKS TO TURN IT INTO
THE MOSQUITO HILTON.

450
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:55,427
NO, NO,
I CANCELED THAT LOAN.

451
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,529
GREAT!

452
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,632
WELL, YOU USE THE CHEQUE
SO YOU CAN KEEP YOUR JOB.

453
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:02,935
[softly]
THANK YOU.

454
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:03,468
ALL RIGHT

455
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,538
YOU KNOW, IN YOUR OWN WAY,
YOU'RE SAYING THAT
YOU LIKE ME

456
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,173
AND THAT YOU WANT
ME TO STAY.

457
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:08,974
I SAID THAT?

458
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,542
AND THIS CHEQUE
MEANS NOTHING.

459
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,511
THAT MEANS
WAY MORE TO ME.

460
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:13,545
I SAID THAT?

461
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,080
YOU KNOW WHAT I DID?
YOU KNOW WHAT I DID?

462
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,982
YOU KNOW WHAT I DID?
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I DID.

463
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,151
I PAID THE $5,000
OUT OF MY OWN POCKET.

464
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,253
SO YES,
I AM STAYING.

465
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,355
WELL, GOOD FOR YOU,
HAROLD.

466
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:24,990
YOU KNOW WHAT?
GOOD FOR ALL OF US.

467
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,025
YEAH, YOU KNOW, I'D RATHER
MAKE A LOWER INCOME

468
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:28,560
IF IT MEANS I'LL
BE ABLE TO LIVE HERE.

469
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,761
GOOD FOR YOU.

470
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:30,796
IS THAT DUMB?

471
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,732
I DUNNO, BUT IT'S
HOW CANADA WAS BUILT.

472
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,668
[possum squealing]

473
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,370
MEETING TIME
YEAH, YOU GO AHEAD HAROLD

474
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,072
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

475
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,440
OH, THIS IS GREAT

476
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,208
OKAY, IF MY WIFE
IS WATCHING,

477
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:46,411
HAROLD HAS ABANDONED HIS WHOLE
PLAN TO RENOVATE THE LODGE.

478
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,046
THAT'S GOTTA BE
GREAT NEWS.

479
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:50,048
AND HE ACTUALLY
PAID OFF A DEBT,

480
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:51,783
AND THAT'S ABOUT
AS MUCH RADICAL CHANGE

481
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,719
AS WE CAN ABSORB
AT ONE TIME.

482
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,320
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

483
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,688
ON BEHALF OF
MYSELF AND HAROLD

484
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,857
AND THE WHOLE GANG UP
HERE AT POSSUM LODGE,

485
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:00,659
YOU KEEP YOUR
STICK ON THE ICE.

486
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:04,963
[cheers and applause]

487
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,468
SIT DOWN, GUYS.

488
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:10,135
SIT DOWN.

489
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,404
THAT'S IT.
HAVE A SEAT.

490
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,439
ALL RISE.

491
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:19,611
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI.

492
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,546
Red: SIT DOWN.

493
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:24,283
ALL RIGHT, MEN, BOW YOUR
HEADS FOR THE MAN'S PRAYER.

494
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,052
I'M A MAN, BUT I CAN CHANGE

495
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,988
IF I HAVE TO, I GUESS.

496
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,158
OKAY, MEN, I'VE GOT
GREAT NEWS.

497
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:36,962
HAROLD HAS ACTUALLY PAID OFF
THE DEBT ALL BY HIMSELF.

498
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:45,170
SO NOW WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT THE BANK HONOURING
THIS CHEQUE,

499
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,706
EVEN THOUGH WE POST DATED IT
TEN YEARS FROM NOW.
