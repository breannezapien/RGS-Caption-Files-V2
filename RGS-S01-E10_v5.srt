YOUR VERY OWN ADJUSTABLE BED.

86

YOU KNOW, THEY SAY THAT YOU

87

88
00:03:05,217 --> 00:03:06,519
ASLEEP, EVEN MORE IF YOU'RE IN

89
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,254
SCHOOL, SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

90
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:09,855
YOU HAVE A COMFORTABLE BED THAT

91
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:11,958
FITS RIGHT TO YOUR OWN CONTOURS

92
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,092
NO MATTER WHAT SIZE YOUR

93
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,860
CONTOURS ARE.

94
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,695
SO I'M GONNA SHOW YOU HOW TO

95
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,196
SAVE YOURSELF A LOT OF MONEY AND

96
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,798
MAKE YOUR OWN ADJUSTABLE BED.

97
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,166
WHAT YOU NEED FIRST OF ALL IS A

98
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:23,069
COUPLE OF PIECES OF 1/2 INCH OR

99
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,237

100
00:03:30,242 --> 00:03:31,944
THIS IS SOME SCRAP LUMBER

101
00:03:31,944 --> 00:03:35,481
THAT I FOUND.

102
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,849
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS CREATE A

103
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,818
HINGE BETWEEN THE TWO HALVES,

104
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,152
AND YOU DO THAT USIN' THE

105
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:43,823
HANDYMAN'S SECRET WEAPON:

106
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:45,791
DUCT TAPE.

107
00:03:51,163 --> 00:03:52,565
ALL RIGHT, WELL, YOU CAN SEE

108
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,900
HERE I'M JUST FINISHING UP THE

109
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,502
TAPING FOR MY HINGE, AND I HAVE

110
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:57,737
THIS END OF THE BED SUPPORTED BY

111
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,139
MY COLLECTABLES, AND ON THIS END

112
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,675
I HAVE THREE CAR JACKS.

113
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,444
THREE JACKS BEATS TWO PAIR.

114
00:04:05,444 --> 00:04:08,114
SO NOW WHAT I DO IS JUST THROW

115
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:10,082
MY MATTRESS ON THERE.

116
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:20,960
AND I HAVE MYSELF

117
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,964
A HOMEMADE ADJUSTABLE BED.

118
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,832
[sighs]

119
00:04:26,832 --> 00:04:28,400
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT COMFORT?

120
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,370
[laughter]

121
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,495
>> NOW, IF THAT ISN'T COMFORT,

122
00:04:56,495 --> 00:04:57,162
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

123
00:04:57,162 --> 00:04:59,732
I CAN'T FEEL ANY PART OF MY BACK

124
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,767
NOW, AND THAT'S PROBABLY DUE TO

125
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:04,670
THIS BED, SO THERE YOU HAVE IT.

126
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:05,337
THAT'S THE TRICK.

127

BUT IT WORKS GREAT.

130
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,041
AND SO UNTIL NEXT TIME,

131
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,542
REMEMBER: IF THE WOMEN DON'T

132
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:12,111
FIND YOU HANDSOME, THEY SHOULD

133
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,113

00:09:58,062 --> 00:09:58,730
>> NO. NO.

344
00:09:58,730 --> 00:09:59,397
WE JUST GOTTA--WELL,

345
00:09:59,397 --> 00:10:00,064
I GOTTA MOVE ON.

346
00:10:00,064 --> 00:10:00,965
>> NO, NO! COME ON, PLEASE!

347
00:10:00,965 --> 00:10:02,634
DON'T--DON'T GO SO FAST!

348
00:10:02,634 --> 00:10:03,301
>> NO. NO, GORD.

349
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:04,035
SORRY, GORD. GORD. GORD.

350
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:04,702
>> PLEASE!

351
00:10:04,702 --> 00:10:05,637
>> GORD. GORD.

352
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:06,804
>> I MADE SANDWICHES!

353
00:10:06,804 --> 00:10:09,307
I MADE FINGER SANDWICHES, EH?

354
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:10,475
>> MAYBE WE CAN DROP BY

355
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:11,142
ANOTHER TIME, EH?

356
00:10:11,142 --> 00:10:12,043
WE'LL HAVE THE SANDWICHES THEN.

357
00:10:12,043 --> 00:10:12,710
>> OKAY! GREAT!

358
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,378
>> UH-HUH.

359
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:14,212
>> YOU'RE COMIN' BACK THEN?

360
00:10:14,212 --> 00:10:15,346
>> YEAH. YEAH. OH, YEAH, YEAH.

361
00:10:15,346 --> 00:10:16,080
>> GREAT.

362
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,315
WHAT ABOUT TOMORROW AT 2:15

363
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:18,316
'CAUSE THE SANDWICHES WILL KEEP,

364
00:10:18,316 --> 00:10:19,150
I THINK.

365
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,652
>> UH, WELL, I--

366
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:21,486
UH, WE COULD TRY.

367
00:10:21,486 --> 00:10:22,487
DON'T WANT TO MAKE ANY PROMISES.

368
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:23,154
>> GREAT. OKAY.

369
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:24,322
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW THEN.

370
00:10:24,322 --> 00:10:26,324
>> NO, NO. I SAID WE'LL TRY.

371
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:30,161
>> DONE!

372
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:31,162
>> YOU CAN JOIN IN THIS ONE.

373
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:31,930
>> OH, EXCELLENT.

374

EXCELLENT, UNCLE RED!

THAT'S EXCELLENT.

396
00:11:11,202 --> 00:11:11,869
I JUST TOOK THE LETTERS

397
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:12,837
OUT OF THE MAIL BAG.

398
00:11:12,837 --> 00:11:13,971
I WAS GONNA READ THEM OUT LOUD,

399
00:11:13,971 --> 00:11:15,440
AND YOU WALK IN TO ANSWER THEM.

400
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,274
THAT'S EXCELLENT.

401
00:11:16,274 --> 00:11:17,008
THAT'S--

402
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:18,176
THIS IS WORKIN' REALLY WELL.

403
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:18,876
THIS IS FANTASTIC.

404
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:19,677
THIS IS A VERY WELL-PRODUCED

405
00:11:19,677 --> 00:11:20,411
PROGRAM.

406
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:21,412
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT UP FRONT

407
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:22,980
'CAUSE I TRULY BELIEVE THAT.

408
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,715
[laughs]

409
00:11:24,715 --> 00:11:26,617
LETTER NUMBER ONE.

410
00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:27,819
DEAR RED GREEN, OH.

411
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:28,486
THAT'S EXCELLENT.

412
00:11:28,486 --> 00:11:29,187
THEY USED YOUR NAME AND

413
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:29,854
EVERYTHING.

414
00:11:29,854 --> 00:11:31,322
"MY WIFE AND I HAVE BEEN MARRIED

415
00:11:31,322 --> 00:11:32,390
FOR 29 YEARS.

416
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,758
OUR SEX LIFE WAS GREAT FOR A

417
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:35,493
LONG TIME, BUT FOR THE PAST 28

418
00:11:35,493 --> 00:11:38,763
YEARS, IT'S BEEN HEAVY SLOGGING.

419
00:11:38,763 --> 00:11:39,497
WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND TO

420
00:11:39,497 --> 00:11:41,165
REVITALIZE OUR LOVE LIFE?"

421
00:11:41,165 --> 00:11:44,202
>> WELL, HAROLD, A SITUATION

422
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:45,803
LIKE THIS, I KIND OF RECOMMEND

423
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:47,138
THAT THEY USE WHAT WE CALL

424
00:11:47,138 --> 00:11:49,140
FANTASIES WHERE THE HUSBAND AND

425
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,208
WIFE PRETEND THAT THEY'RE

426
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,509
DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

427
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:52,743
PREFERABLY PEOPLE WITH A BETTER

428
00:11:52,743 --> 00:11:54,111
LOVE LIFE.

429
00:11:54,111 --> 00:11:56,180
FOR EXAMPLE, NOW, HE COULD

430
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,515
PRETEND THAT HE'S A KNIGHT IN

431
00:11:57,515 --> 00:11:59,283
SHINING ARMOR, AND SHE COULD BE

432
00:11:59,283 --> 00:11:59,951
THE MILKMAID.

433
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:00,618
>> OH! OH!

434
00:12:00,618 --> 00:12:01,485
OR, LIKE, HE COULD BE THE

435
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:02,653
PARCEL-TOTING MAILMAN AND SHE

436
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:04,121
COULD BE THE STARTLED SUNBATHER.

437
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:05,289
OR--OR YOU KNOW WHAT'S ANOTHER

438
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:06,123
GOOD ONE?

439
00:12:06,123 --> 00:12:07,325
HE'S THE PIZZA DELIVERY BOY,

440
00:12:07,325 --> 00:12:08,626
AND SHE'S THE DIVORCEE

441
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:11,095
WHO LOST HER COUPONS.

442
00:12:11,095 --> 00:12:13,064
>> YEAH, OR IF THEY FIND THAT

443
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:15,066
GETTING REPETITIVE, THEY CAN

444
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:16,033
KIND OF MIX AND MATCH.

445
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:18,436
HE COULD BE THE PIZZA MAILMAN

446
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:19,737
IN SHINING ARMOR, AND SHE COULD

447
00:12:19,737 --> 00:12:21,005
BE THE STARTLED MILKMAID WHO

448
00:12:21,005 --> 00:12:22,373
LOST HER COUPON.

449
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:24,008
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT THIS

450
00:12:24,008 --> 00:12:25,476
IS, LIKE, CHEATING,

451
00:12:25,476 --> 00:12:26,510
BUT IT'S NOT.

452
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,812
IT'S A LOT SAFER.

453
00:12:27,812 --> 00:12:29,146
>> YEAH, AND MY SUGGESTION IS

454
00:12:29,146 --> 00:12:30,281
THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY,

455
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:31,482
LIKE, SILKY UNDER THINGS OR

456
00:12:31,482 --> 00:12:32,984
PEEKABOO NIGHTGOWNS.

457
00:12:32,984 --> 00:12:34,385
>> YEAH, AND IF THAT DOESN'T

458
00:12:34,385 --> 00:12:35,519
WORK, THEN HE COULD GET HIS WIFE

459
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,621
TO WEAR THOSE.

460
00:12:36,621 --> 00:12:37,588
>> THAT'S TRUE.

461
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:38,255
OKAY.

462
00:12:38,255 --> 00:12:39,156
I'VE GOT ANOTHER LETTER,

463
00:12:39,156 --> 00:12:39,991
UNCLE RED.

464
00:12:39,991 --> 00:12:40,958
"DEAR RED.

465
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,326
FIRST, DO YOU BELIEVE, AS

466
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:43,961
EINSTEIN SAID, THAT GOD DOES NOT

467
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:45,329
PLAY DICE WITH THE UNIVERSE AND

468
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:46,864
THAT ALL REALITY IS ULTIMATELY

469
00:12:46,864 --> 00:12:48,466
KNOWABLE, OR DOES HEISENBERG'S

470
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:49,767
UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE AND THE

471
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:51,102
QUARK THEORY PROVE THAT THERE

472
00:12:51,102 --> 00:12:52,336
ARE INTRINSIC PHYSICAL LIMITS TO

473
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:53,604
RESOLUTION THAT PROVE FREE WILL

474
00:12:53,604 --> 00:12:56,907
EXIST AND PRECLUDES DETERMINISM?

475
00:12:56,907 --> 00:12:58,075
MY SECOND QUESTION IS,

476
00:12:58,075 --> 00:12:59,310
WHEN YOU WENT TROUT FISHING

477
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,144
ON YOUR LAST SHOW,

478
00:13:00,144 --> 00:13:01,846
WHAT KIND OF LURE DID YOU USE?"

479
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:03,547
SIGNED, ARTHUR.

480
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:04,482
>> ALL RIGHT, HAROLD.

481
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:06,283
I'D LIKE TO ANSWER THE SECOND

482
00:13:06,283 --> 00:13:08,419
QUESTION FIRST, IF I MAY.

483
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:11,088
WE USED A MEPPS CRAZY SPOONER ON

484
00:13:11,088 --> 00:13:13,290
A METAL LEADER WITH A 25-POUND

485
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,792
TEST LINE, I GUESS IT WAS.

486
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:15,860
THE CRAZY SPOONER IS REALLY THE

487
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,561
EXCELLENT LURE FOR TROUT BECAUSE

488
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:18,629
IT SHOWS UP SO WELL

489
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:20,664
IN THE FAST-MOVING WATER.

490
00:13:20,664 --> 00:13:22,833
THAT LURE WAS GIVEN TO ME,

491
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,668
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, BUT A

492
00:13:24,668 --> 00:13:26,437
FEMALE ARM WRESTLER AT A BAR IN

493
00:13:26,437 --> 00:13:27,304
THE YUKON.

494
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:29,507
IT WAS NEW YEARS EVE, 1959,

495
00:13:29,507 --> 00:13:30,975
DURING A BOILED EGG EATING

496
00:13:30,975 --> 00:13:32,243
CONTEST.

497
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:34,078
I WAS LOSIN' THE CONTEST REAL

498
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:35,679
BAD, AND THEN SHE JUST KIND OF

499
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:37,615
DROPPED A LURE INTO MY SHORTS

500
00:13:37,615 --> 00:13:39,250
THERE AND GAVE ME A WEDGIE, AND

501
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,852
I GASPED SO HARD I SUCKED IN

502
00:13:41,852 --> 00:13:44,288
ABOUT NINE MORE EGGS AND WON THE

503
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:46,257
CONTEST, WINNING FIRST PRIZE,

504
00:13:46,257 --> 00:13:48,292
WHICH WAS A STUFFED MUSKRAT, AND

505
00:13:48,292 --> 00:13:49,927
I BELIEVE THAT ANSWERS

506
00:13:49,927 --> 00:13:51,896
THE FIRST QUESTION.

507
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:58,869
THIS WEEK ON ADVENTURES WITH

508
00:13:58,869 --> 00:14:01,605
BILL, BILL WANTED TO SHOW

509
00:14:01,605 --> 00:14:03,641
YOU--OH, THERE'S BILL NOW.

510
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:05,876
YEAH. YEAH.

511
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:06,810
HE WANTED TO SHOW YOU HOW TO

512
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:07,878
BUILD A SHELTER USIN' A

513
00:14:07,878 --> 00:14:09,113
PARACHUTE.

514
00:14:09,113 --> 00:14:10,247
THAT'S A PARACHUTE.

515
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:11,115
I DON'T THINK HE PAID FULL

516
00:14:11,115 --> 00:14:13,183
RETAIL FOR THAT ONE.

517
00:14:13,183 --> 00:14:14,585
NOW, THE FIRST JOB IS TO GET THE

518
00:14:14,585 --> 00:14:15,853
PARACHUTE TO OPEN.

519
00:14:15,853 --> 00:14:16,687
SO HE'S GONNA UP THE LADDER

520
00:14:16,687 --> 00:14:17,988
THERE, AND HE HAS A LOT OF FUN,

521
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:19,623
AND--LOOK OUT. LOOK OUT, BILL.

522
00:14:19,623 --> 00:14:23,127
OH.

523
00:14:23,127 --> 00:14:24,261
MAYBE THAT WAS A BAD SPOT FOR

524
00:14:24,261 --> 00:14:25,429
THE LADDER, YOU KNOW, IN

525
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:26,664
HINDSIGHT.

526
00:14:26,664 --> 00:14:28,065
NOW WE'VE GOT ANOTHER SPOT.

527
00:14:28,065 --> 00:14:29,500
HE'S GONNA--HE'S HOPIN' THAT THE

528
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,736
CHUTE WILL OPEN JUST IN THIS--IT

529
00:14:32,736 --> 00:14:37,341
DIDN'T WORK REAL WELL, YOU KNOW?

530
00:14:37,341 --> 00:14:40,010
SO NOW HE'S--HE ASKED ME TO--IF

531
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,312
I JUST WOULD SORT OF WHAT WE

532
00:14:41,312 --> 00:14:43,314
CALL A MANUAL DISENFOLDMENT

533
00:14:43,314 --> 00:14:44,682
TECHNIQUE.

534
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:47,985
IT'S A MILITARY KIND OF A MOVE,

535
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:49,520
AND WELL, THERE'S A LOT OF

536
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,321
MATERIAL IN THOSE--THEY'RE LIKE

537
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:53,123
MOOSE THOMPSON'S PANTS.

538
00:14:53,123 --> 00:14:55,225
IT'S A WINDY DAY.

539
00:14:55,225 --> 00:14:56,460
I DON'T THINK--YOU KNOW, IN

540
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,961
RETROSPECT I WOULDN'T HAVE TRIED

541
00:14:57,961 --> 00:14:59,963
TO DO THIS ON SUCH A HIGH

542
00:14:59,963 --> 00:15:02,232
WINDY--BUT THEN BILL, YOU KNOW,

543
00:15:02,232 --> 00:15:04,268
HE SAID, "NO, NO.

544
00:15:04,268 --> 00:15:05,636
WE'RE--THIS IS A PERFECT DAY."

545
00:15:05,636 --> 00:15:07,971
WELL, SEE THERE--WELL, I DIDN'T

546
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:08,872
WANT TO ARGUE WITH HIM.

547
00:15:08,872 --> 00:15:09,940
HE HAD THE HOOK THERE HANGIN'

548
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,075
FROM HIS BELT, AND I DIDN'T

549
00:15:11,075 --> 00:15:12,276
NOTICE THIS EITHER, BUT THIS

550
00:15:12,276 --> 00:15:13,744
IS--I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS PART OF

551
00:15:13,744 --> 00:15:14,711
THE PLAN OR WHAT, AND

552
00:15:14,711 --> 00:15:16,213
THEN--WELL, THE WIND TOOK HIM

553
00:15:16,213 --> 00:15:18,081
AND--NOW, AT THIS POINT I'M

554
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:20,017
THINKING, YOU KNOW, WHAT EXACTLY

555
00:15:20,017 --> 00:15:20,684
IS BILL'S PLAN?

556
00:15:20,684 --> 00:15:24,388
>> [yelling]

557
00:15:24,388 --> 00:15:25,322
>> TO THE AVERAGE PERSON, THAT

558
00:15:25,322 --> 00:15:26,924
WOULD LOOK LIKE HE MIGHT HAVE

559
00:15:26,924 --> 00:15:28,459
BEEN OUT OF CONTROL.

560
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:30,060
IT'S SO DARN HARD TO TELL WITH

561
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,796
BILL, YOU KNOW?

562
00:15:32,796 --> 00:15:34,231
INSTEAD OF SHELTER, THIS WAS

563
00:15:34,231 --> 00:15:35,632
MORE OF A MOBILE HOME AT THIS

564
00:15:35,632 --> 00:15:38,936
POINT THAT HE WAS MOVIN'.

565
00:15:38,936 --> 00:15:39,603
YEAH, HE WAS GETTIN'

566
00:15:39,603 --> 00:15:40,337
QUITE A WAYS AWAY.

567
00:15:40,337 --> 00:15:41,138
LOOK OUT. LOOK OUT! LOOK OUT!

568
00:15:41,138 --> 00:15:41,905
LOOK OUT! OH!

569
00:15:41,905 --> 00:15:42,639
>> [grunts]

570
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,144
>> UH.

571
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:48,812
NOW HERE, THIS PART OF THE PLAN

572
00:15:48,812 --> 00:15:50,881
I'M SAYING TO MYSELF, "UH, BILL,

573
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:52,849
UH--OOH.

574
00:15:52,849 --> 00:15:55,686
IS THIS REALLY NECESSARY?"

575
00:15:55,686 --> 00:15:56,653
BUT I GUESS HE WAS JUST

576
00:15:56,653 --> 00:15:58,388
PICKING THE RIGHT SPOT TO PUT--

577
00:15:58,388 --> 00:15:59,489
TO BUILD THE SHELTER

578
00:15:59,489 --> 00:16:00,824
'CAUSE HE EVENTUALLY

579
00:16:00,824 --> 00:16:03,427
BROUGHT HER TO A HALT AND

580
00:16:03,427 --> 00:16:04,761
FINALLY FOUND A SPOT THAT I

581
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:07,197
GUESS MUST SUITED HIS LIKING.

582
00:16:07,197 --> 00:16:08,198
[clears throat]

583
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:09,933
AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIM.

584
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:11,902
HE'S FINE.

585
00:16:14,938 --> 00:16:16,607
"IT IS WINTER.

586
00:16:16,607 --> 00:16:18,041
MY CAR IS SAFELY NESTLED

587
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,810
IN A DITCH.

588
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,378
I STAND BEHIND IT AND WARM MY

589
00:16:21,378 --> 00:16:23,947
FACE IN THE EXHAUST.

590
00:16:23,947 --> 00:16:25,382
IT FEELS GOOD BUT IT MAKES LUNCH

591
00:16:25,382 --> 00:16:27,351
TASTE FUNNY."

592
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:41,498
[clears throat]

593
00:16:41,498 --> 00:16:42,833
THIS POINT IN THE SHOW,

594
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,001
I STEP OUT OF THE LIMELIGHT

595
00:16:45,001 --> 00:16:49,506
AND KIND OF BRING IN A LEMON.

596
00:16:49,506 --> 00:16:50,173
>> OKAY.

597
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:50,841
ALL RIGHT.

598
00:16:50,841 --> 00:16:51,842
CELEBRITY PROFILES.

599
00:16:51,842 --> 00:16:52,809
OKAY?

600
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:53,810
THIS IS A MAGAZINE THAT

601
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,479
TEENAGERS READ, AND IT'S GOT,

602
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:57,314
LIKE, CELEBRITY PROFILES IN IT,

603
00:16:57,314 --> 00:16:58,982
BUT THEY HAVEN'T GOT AROUND TO

604
00:16:58,982 --> 00:17:00,350
ME YET.

605
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,184
[laughs]

606
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:02,385
THAT'S WEIRD, EH?

607
00:17:02,385 --> 00:17:03,820
BUT THE REASON I FIGURE IS

608
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,689
'CAUSE THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHO I

609
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:07,190
AM, WHICH WILL CERTAINLY DELAY

610
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,425
THINGS, YOU KNOW,

611
00:17:08,425 --> 00:17:09,826
UNDERSTANDABLY, BUT RATHER THAN

612
00:17:09,826 --> 00:17:10,927
WAIT FOR THEM TO COME TO ME,

613
00:17:10,927 --> 00:17:11,962
I'VE DECIDED TO DO MY OWN

ALL RIGHTY.

I GUESS, THERMAL NUCLEAR WAR

641
00:17:51,234 --> 00:17:53,103
WOULD BE PRETTY TURN-OFFISH.

642
00:17:53,103 --> 00:17:54,471
OKAY.

643
00:17:54,471 --> 00:17:55,505

PLAN THAT OR NOTHIN'.

655
00:18:07,584 --> 00:18:08,752
IT JUST--THAT WAS COOL.

THAT AS WELL.

668

MAYBE THE CABLE'S ON THE FRITZ,

682
00:18:43,686 --> 00:18:44,487
AND THIS IS THE ONLY CHANNEL

683
00:18:44,487 --> 00:18:45,555
YOU CAN GET,

684
00:18:45,555 --> 00:18:46,222
AND I WANT TO TAKE THIS

685
00:18:46,222 --> 00:18:47,524
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU YOUNG

686
00:18:47,524 --> 00:18:48,625
PEOPLE ABOUT

687
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,093
THE IDEA OF LEAVIN' HOME.

688
00:18:50,093 --> 00:18:51,561
I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF APPEAL

689
00:18:51,561 --> 00:18:52,996
IN THE IDEA OF HAVING YOUR OWN

690
00:18:52,996 --> 00:18:54,230
PLACE, YOU KNOW, WHERE YOUR

691
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,365
PARENTS CAN'T HASSLE YOU ABOUT

692
00:18:55,365 --> 00:18:57,901
WHERE YOU GOT ALL THOSE STEREOS

693
00:18:57,901 --> 00:18:58,635
AND WHERE YOU CAN HAVE SOME

694
00:18:58,635 --> 00:19:00,036
PRIVACY TO PLAN BANK ROBBERIES

695
00:19:00,036 --> 00:19:01,838
OR MAYBE HAVE DIVORCEES UP

696
00:19:01,838 --> 00:19:03,406
ON P.D. DAYS.

697
00:19:03,406 --> 00:19:04,707
BUT BEFORE YOU GO MOVING OUT,

698
00:19:04,707 --> 00:19:05,708
I WANT YOU TO THINK

699
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:06,776
ABOUT HOW MUCH IT MUST BE

700
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:08,077
COSTING YOUR PARENTS TO HAVE YOU

701
00:19:08,077 --> 00:19:09,779
LIVE AT HOME, AND HOW MISERABLE

702
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:11,047
IT'S MAKING THEIR LIVES TO HAVE

703
00:19:11,047 --> 00:19:12,482
YOU THERE, AND IT ALL KIND OF

704
00:19:12,482 --> 00:19:13,316
WORKS OUT.

705
00:19:13,316 --> 00:19:14,217
DOESN'T IT?

706
00:19:14,217 --> 00:19:15,285
ANOTHER THING YOU SHOULD

707
00:19:15,285 --> 00:19:16,319
REMEMBER IS THAT AS YOUR PARENTS

708
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:18,922
GET OLDER THEY START LOSIN' IT,

709
00:19:18,922 --> 00:19:20,056
AND EVENTUALLY THEY END UP

710
00:19:20,056 --> 00:19:21,291
WILLING EVERYTHING TO THE KID

711
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,592
WHO STAYED HOME THE LONGEST.

712
00:19:22,592 --> 00:19:23,593
[clears throat]

713
00:19:23,593 --> 00:19:25,562
MAKE SURE IT'S YOU.

714
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,131
I'M SURE A LOT OF YOU WANT TO

715
00:19:28,131 --> 00:19:29,199
FIND OUT ABOUT THE TOUPEE,

716
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:30,500
AND I WON'T DISAPPOINT YOU.

717
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,035
>> YES, YOU WILL.

718
00:19:32,035 --> 00:19:33,269
>> I'M GONNA FINISH THE STORY,

719
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:33,937
HAROLD.

720
00:19:33,937 --> 00:19:36,005
>> I KNOW.

721
00:19:45,214 --> 00:19:46,015
>> NOW, HAROLD, YOU KNOW, YOU

722
00:19:46,015 --> 00:19:46,950
CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WHEN IT

723
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,318
COMES TO GETTIN' YOURSELF A CAR

724
00:19:48,318 --> 00:19:49,752
OR ANYTHING ELSE, REALLY.

725
00:19:49,752 --> 00:19:50,920
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS, EH?

726
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,588
>> RIGHT.

727
00:19:51,588 --> 00:19:52,956
>> BUT I WOULD ADVISE YOU NOT TO

728
00:19:52,956 --> 00:19:54,724
BUY ANYTHING NEW.

729
00:19:54,724 --> 00:19:55,592
GO USED.

730
00:19:55,592 --> 00:19:56,492
>> OH, NO.

731
00:19:56,492 --> 00:19:57,160
IF IT'S USED, THAT MEANS

732
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,827
IT'S OLD.

733
00:19:57,827 --> 00:19:58,795
>> OH, NO. NO, IT'S NOT OLD.

734
00:19:58,795 --> 00:20:00,263
IT'S--WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS THEY

735
00:20:00,263 --> 00:20:01,764
FOUND THE PROBLEMS AND THEY

736
00:20:01,764 --> 00:20:03,333
FIXED THEM, SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO

737
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,634
PAY FOR THAT.

738
00:20:04,634 --> 00:20:05,535
>> WHAT IF THEY DIDN'T FIX 'EM?

739
00:20:05,535 --> 00:20:06,336
MAYBE THEY ONLY FOUND 'EM AND

740
00:20:06,336 --> 00:20:07,136
THEY LEFT EM THERE HIDDEN

741
00:20:07,136 --> 00:20:08,171
FOR YOU?

742
00:20:08,171 --> 00:20:09,072
>> WELL, YOU'RE GONNA GET THAT

743
00:20:09,072 --> 00:20:10,106
WITH A NEW.

744
00:20:10,106 --> 00:20:10,773
>> WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

745
00:20:10,773 --> 00:20:11,574
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY WHEN YOU

746
00:20:11,574 --> 00:20:12,308
BUY A LEMON.

747
00:20:12,308 --> 00:20:13,076
>> YOU BUY A LEMON,

748
00:20:13,076 --> 00:20:15,144
AND YOU GET THE SQUEEZE.

749
00:20:15,144 --> 00:20:16,212
>> [laughs]

750
00:20:16,212 --> 00:20:17,246
>> AND THE PITS.

751
00:20:17,246 --> 00:20:17,947
>> OH, THAT'S GOOD!

752
00:20:17,947 --> 00:20:18,614
>> UH-HUH.

753
00:20:18,614 --> 00:20:20,216
>> AND THEN THE RIND.

754
00:20:20,216 --> 00:20:20,883
OH, NO, THAT--

755
00:20:20,883 --> 00:20:21,551
>> NO.

756
00:20:21,551 --> 00:20:22,318
THAT, YOU'D HAVE TO DRIVE TO

757
00:20:22,318 --> 00:20:25,154
GERMANY FOR THAT.

758
00:20:25,154 --> 00:20:25,855

HE'S NOT HOME YET.

[laughs]

851
00:21:59,882 --> 00:22:00,716
NOT BLOODY LIKELY.

852
00:22:00,716 --> 00:22:01,384
>> OH, GOD.

853
00:22:01,384 --> 00:22:02,351
>> SO WHAT ELSE COULD I DO?

854
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:03,886
I MEAN, WHAT ELSE COULD I DO?

855
00:22:03,886 --> 00:22:04,687
I HAD TO KICK THE BLOODY THING

856
00:22:04,687 --> 00:22:05,354

857
00:22:05,354 --> 00:22:06,022

863
00:22:12,328 --> 00:22:12,995

864
00:22:12,995 --> 00:22:13,729

THIS IS GONNA BE ONE SIDE OF THE

870
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:21,637
WINDSHIELD.

871

873
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:23,706
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

874
00:22:23,706 --> 00:22:24,440
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS NOW I'M

875
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,142
GONNA NEED ANOTHER BIT

876
00:22:26,142 --> 00:22:27,309

00:22:27,977 --> 00:22:28,778

00:22:31,213 --> 00:22:32,014
I'M GONNA GO DOWN AND GET

883
00:22:32,014 --> 00:22:33,015

884
00:22:33,015 --> 00:22:33,816

885
00:22:33,816 --> 00:22:35,017

00:22:38,888 --> 00:22:39,555
>> YEAH. ALL RIGHT.

891
00:22:39,555 --> 00:22:40,556

892
00:22:40,556 --> 00:22:41,724
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO.

893
00:22:41,724 --> 00:22:42,858

00:22:42,858 --> 00:22:43,626

897
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,628
>> ALL RIGHT.

898
00:22:45,628 --> 00:22:47,596
>> FAIR ENOUGH.

899
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:53,903
>> SO ANYWAY, STINKY PETERSON

900
00:22:53,903 --> 00:22:54,970
MANAGED TO GET OLD MAN

901
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,505
SEDGEWICK'S TOUPEE WASHED.

902
00:22:56,505 --> 00:22:57,807
HE PICKED IT UP WITH A PAIR OF

903
00:22:57,807 --> 00:22:59,508
BARBEQUE TONGS, DROPPED IT INTO

904
00:22:59,508 --> 00:23:00,910
A MINNOW PAIL, AND THEN HE

905
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,178
HOOKED IT ONTO THE ANCHOR OF THE

906
00:23:02,178 --> 00:23:03,379
ALUMINUM BOAT AND TOWED IT

907
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:04,647
AROUND THE LAKE FOR AN HOUR AND

908
00:23:04,647 --> 00:23:06,515
A HALF OR SO, BUT THEN WHEN HE

909
00:23:06,515 --> 00:23:08,117
PULLED THE MINNOW PAIL BACK IN

910
00:23:08,117 --> 00:23:10,920
THE TOUPEE WAS GONE, AND OLD MAN

911
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,121
SEDGEWICK WAS PRETTY MAD BECAUSE

912
00:23:12,121 --> 00:23:13,455
BY NOW HE WAS GETTIN' TERMINAL

913
00:23:13,455 --> 00:23:16,125
HAT-HEAD, BUT WE HAVE A LEAD ON

914
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,326
THE HAIRPIECE 'CAUSE WE HEARD

915
00:23:17,326 --> 00:23:18,727
THAT A GUY UP THE LAKE CAUGHT A

916
00:23:18,727 --> 00:23:19,962
BASS THAT LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE

917
00:23:19,962 --> 00:23:21,463
HOWARD COSELL,

918
00:23:21,463 --> 00:23:23,866
EXCEPT IT WAS A SMALLMOUTH.

919
00:23:23,866 --> 00:23:25,701
SO IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING, I'M

920
00:23:25,701 --> 00:23:26,802
GONNA COME STRAIGHT HOME AFTER

921
00:23:26,802 --> 00:23:27,903
THE SHOW AND I'LL BE PICKIN' UP

922
00:23:27,903 --> 00:23:29,071
A DOZEN DOUGHNUTS, AND IF THE

923
00:23:29,071 --> 00:23:30,039
TRAFFIC'S NOT TOO BAD THERE MAY

924
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:31,707
BE ONE LEFT FOR YOU.

925
00:23:31,707 --> 00:23:33,242
SO UNTIL NEXT TIME, ON BEHALF OF

926
00:23:33,242 --> 00:23:34,543
MYSELF AND HAROLD AND THE WHOLE

00:23:34,543 --> 00:23:36,145
GANG UP HERE AT THE LODGE,

928
00:23:36,145 --> 00:23:38,147
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

929
00:23:38,147 --> 00:23:41,050
