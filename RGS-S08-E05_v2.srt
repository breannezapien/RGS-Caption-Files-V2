1
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:04,037
ONE OF THE BIG DISADVANTAGES

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:05,972
OF HAVING A CAR WITH ALL
THE FANCY EXTRA FEATURES IS...

3
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:07,507
YOU'VE GOTTA PAY FOR 'EM.

4
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,442
BUT, MOST OF THEM CAN BE FAKED.

5
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:12,212
FOR EXAMPLE: "THE KEYLESS,
REMOTE DOOR ENTRY SYSTEM."

6
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:16,549
JUST GET YOURSELF
A PAIR OF PRUNING SHEARS
AND JUST SNIP THAT THING OFF,

7
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:19,586
SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S
DOWN ALL THE TIME.

8
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:23,256
THEN, GET YOURSELF
A CHILD'S SQUEAKY TOY.

9
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,592
NOW, YOU CAN FAKE BEING RICH.

10
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:28,294
WELL, MOST PEOPLE GOT
RICH FAKING SOMETHING.

11
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,929
[squeak, squeak]

12
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,367
IT'S THE RED GREEN SHOW.

13
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:37,937
AND NOW, HERE'S THE MAN
WHO CAN APPRECIATE JAZZ

14
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:39,439
IF IT WAS JUST A BIT
MORE REPETITIVE.

15
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:40,740
YOUR HOST AND HERO
AND MY UNCLE:

16
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,176
RED GREEN!!!

17
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:46,112
[applause]

18
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:53,653
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
APPRECIATE IT.

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,425
IT'S VERY, VERY SPECIAL DAY
FOR A CERTAIN SOMEBODY UP
AT THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

20
00:00:58,491 --> 00:00:59,626
WHAT, WHO ME?

21
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:01,294
WHAT, I DIDN'T
TOUCH ANYTHING

22
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,096
AND IF I DID
I PUT IT BACK.

23
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,831
NO, HAROLD.

24
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,599
I'M TALKING ABOUT
"THE BIG MOVE."

25
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,234
DON'T YOU HAVE
A BIG MOVE TODAY?

26
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:11,304
OH, YEAH.

27
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,773
THIS GUY RIGHT HERE,
BLOOD RELATIVE OF MINE,

28
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,309
FULL FLEDGED MEMBER
OF THE GREEN FAMILY.

29
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:20,280
I'D SHOW YOU THE CREST,
BUT SOME OF THE IMAGES ARE NOT
SUITABLE FOR FAMILY VIEWING.

30
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:24,084
THIS GUY, HAROLD GREE,
HAS BEEN ACCEPTED
INTO COLLEGE.

31
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,252
CONGRATULATIONS, HAROLD.

32
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,321
[applause]

33
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:31,691
HE SHOOK MY HAND!
HE SHOOK MY HAND!

34
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,194
I DON'T THINK YOU'VE
SHOOK MY HAND BEFORE.

35
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,464
NO, THAT'S A HANDSHAKE
I WOULD REMEMBER, HAROLD.

36
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,533
SO, I GUESS YOU'RE
WORRIED ABOUT MOVING
INTO YOUR DORM?

37
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,470
I'M MOVING INTO A HOUSE
WITH THREE OTHER STUDENTS.

38
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:47,474
WELL, I GUESS YOU'RE GOING
TO NEED SOME WAY OF GETTING
YOUR STUFF DOWN THERE?

39
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,076
YEAH.

40
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,911
DON'T WORRY, HAROLD.

41
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:56,716
I'LL BE GLAD TO TAKE YOU
AND ALL YOUR STUFF IN
THE POSSUM VAN.

42
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:01,387
WHAT THE HECK,
I'M YOUR UNCLE,
FOR GOSH SAKES.

43
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,424
YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE ME AND
ALL MY STUFF INTO THE CITY
IN THE POSSUM VAN?

44
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:08,128
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT?
YEAH, SURE.

45
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,437
IT'S TIME TO PLAY
"THE POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME."

46
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:21,774
AND THIS WEEK OUR FRIEND
RANGER GORD IS PLAYING FOR
A BRAND NEW SET OF DUMBBELLS.

47
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:25,545
SET OF DUMB BELLS,
WE'VE GOT THEM.

48
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,581
THERE'S TWO DUMB BELLS.

49
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,950
OOPS!!!

50
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:33,219
THEY'RE THERE,
YOU CAN SEE THEM.

51
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,021
UNCLE RED...

52
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,557
YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO GET RANGER GORD
TO SAY THIS WORD:

53
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:44,531
OKAY, GO!

54
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,367
CABBAGE.
WHAT?

55
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,435
UH... LETTUCE,
I MEAN GROCERIES!

56
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,004
I HAVEN'T GIVEN YOU
ANY CLUES YET, GORD.

57
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,673
YOU MEAN, IT'S NOT
LETTUCE OR GROCERIES?

58
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,275
DARN, I THOUGHT
I HAD IT THERE.

59
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,577
OKAY, ANDROID.

60
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,712
YOU BETTER GIVE HIM
A CLUE, UNCLE RED.

61
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:02,382
SOMEBODY BETTER
GIVE HIM A CLUE.

62
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,350
I COULD USE
A QUICK BREAK.

63
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:05,585
I NEED TO THINK.

64
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,287
IT'S A SHORT GAME,
ONLY THIRTY SECONDS.

65
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,755
ONLY 15 LEFT, NOW.

66
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,490
COME ON GORD,
THIS WORD'S EASY.

67
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,225
COUCH.

68
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,093
I MEAN, THAT'S A REAL
EASY WORD, YOU KNOW?

69
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,396
THERE'S NO WEIRD
PRONUNCIATION RULES
OR SPELLING THINGS.

70
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:19,165
IT'S EASY: COUCH.

71
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,601
GORD, YOU CAN'T JUST
SAY WORDS AT RANDOM.

72
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,469
SPAGETTI.

73
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,837
FLORIDA?

74
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,706
WAIT 'TIL I GIVE YA
A CLUE AND THEN
YOU SAY IT.

75
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:29,175
ANDROID... COOKIE.

76
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,711
GORD, DO YOU KNOW
HOW MANY WORDS THERE ARE
IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE?

77
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:34,347
I KNOW... NOSTRIL.

78
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,449
[ring, ring, ring]

79
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,551
FIRE, FIRE!!!

80
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,558
I'M SORRY IT TURNED
OUT THAT WAY, HAROLD.

81
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,062
THOSE COLLEGE BOYS
POINTING AND LAUGHING
AT YOU LIKE THAT.

82
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,597
ME?

83
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,732
THEY WERE LAUGHING
AT THE POSSUM VAN.

84
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,302
NOW, WHY WOULD
THEY DO THAT?

85
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:59,505
IT'S A POSSUM VAN.

86
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,241
I GOT TO TELL YA
SOMETHING FOLKS,

87
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,276
THE WHOLE TIME
THAT WE'RE MOVING
HIS JUNK IN THERE,

88
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,144
THERE'S THESE THREE
GIRLS IN THERE.

89
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,814
I GUESS YOUR ROOMMATES
HAVE GIRLFRIENDS, HUH?

90
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,349
OH, NO!

91
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,884
THOSE THREE GIRLS
ARE MY ROOMMATES.

92
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:15,555
PARDON ME, HAROLD?

93
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,124
YOU GOT THREE GIRLS
AS YOUR ROOMMATES?

94
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,393
HOW DOES THAT WORK?

95
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,795
PRETTY WELL.

96
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:26,165
NO, I DON'T WANT YOU
LIVING IN SIN THERE.

97
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,934
NO, NO, NO, THERE'S NO SIN.

98
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,703
EXCEPT, MAYBE THE CABLE HOOK UP.

99
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,206
I SHOULD GET BACK BECAUSE...

100
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,074
HAROLD, LIVING
WITH THREE GIRLS.

101
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,976
YOU'RE GOING TO
GO CRAZY THERE.

102
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,845
NO, UNCLE RED, NO.

103
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:40,780
THERE'S NO SWEAT,
NO PROBLEM.

104
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,215
NO, NO, NO, NO.

105
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,517
IT'S MODERN TIMES,
UNCLE RED, C'MON.

106
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,719
STUDENTS ARE DOING
THIS ALL THE TIME.

107
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,855
I'M VERY CASUAL WITH IT.

108
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,661
WELL, YOU KNOW...
I TELL YA SOMETHING,

109
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:57,196
HE'S LOT COOLER THAN
I THOUGHT HE WAS.

110
00:04:57,263 --> 00:05:06,506
[laughter and applause ]

111
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,844
IF YOU TIE A STRING
TO YOUR FINGER 

112
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,347
TO REMEMBER WHAT
MIGHT BE FORGOT 

113
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,749
IT'S A LITTLE TRICK
THAT I LIKE TO CALL 

114
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,252
A HANDYMAN'S
FORGET-ME-NOT KNOT 

115
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,621
JUST MAKE SURE
IT'S A BIT OF A SLIP KNOT 

116
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:24,123
THAT WILL FALL OFF
AS THE WEEK GOES BY 

117
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,726
OTHERWISE YOU'LL SIT THERE
WITH A STRING ON YOUR FINGER 

118
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,028
AND NEVER REMEMBER WHY 

119
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,207
SAW A SHOW ON THE SPACE
PROGRAM LAST NIGHT.

120
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,643
APPARENTLY, DOGS WERE
IN SPACE BEFORE HUMANS.

121
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,812
OH YEAH, WAY BACK WHEN,

122
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,948
THE RUSSIANS FIRED A DOG
INTO A LITTLE CAPSULE AND
LAUNCHED HIM OFF INTO ORBIT.

123
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,484
I BET EVERYTHING WENT FINE
'TIL HE STUCK HIS HEAD
OUT THE HATCH

124
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,153
TO FEEL THE BREEZE ON HIS FACE.

125
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,023
DOGS LOVE HANGING OUT
OF MOVING VEHICLES, DON'T THEY?

126
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,292
SO, THIS WEEK, ON
"THE HANDYMAN CORNER,"

127
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,427
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A KIND
OF BABY SITTER FOR YOUR DOG.

128
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,197
A MECHANICAL THING,
A KIND OF "PUPPY-GO-ROUND."

129
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,199
THE FIRST THING WE NEED
IS A CAR WINDOW.

130
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,868
AND, OF COURSE, TO DO THAT,
WE HAVE TO FIND A CAR WINDOW.

131
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,140
WELL, HERE'S ONE HERE.

132
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,542
THIS CAR JUST SEEMS
TO BE SITTING HERE.

133
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:17,844
NOBODY AROUND.

134
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,412
I WONDER IF IT'S OPEN.

135
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:20,980
YEAH.

136
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,182
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO NEED...

137
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,084
A HAMMER AND A CHISEL.

138
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:30,356
[bang, bang, squish]

139
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:33,593
ALL RIGHT, GOING TO NEED
A SLEDGEHAMMER, I GUESS.

140
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,400
[glass smashing]

141
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:43,035
WELL, I LOOSENED 'ER.

142
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:44,370
THE PRY BAR.

143
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,440
[metal squeaking]

144
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,142
[red grunting]

145
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,210
[snap!]

146
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,312
[metal squeaking]

147
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,683
[banging and crashing
of metal on metal]

148
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,720
NO, NO, I NEED ONE OF THOSE
BIG ORANGE COLOURED THINGS.

149
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,358
[laughter]

150
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:17,236
[glass breaking]

151
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:28,314
[metal tearing]

152
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,986
[glass shattering]

153
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,466
OH, MAN!

154
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:52,705
LIKE I SAID:
GET YOURSELF A CAR DOOR.

155
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,241
[ Laughter and applause]

156
00:07:57,276 --> 00:08:00,513
NOW, WE NEED SOMETHING TO
USE AS A MERRY-GO-ROUND

157
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,549
AND I'M THINKING, YOU'RE NOT
GOING ICE FISHING FOR AWHILE,

158
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:07,653
SO, WHY DON'T WE USE
OUR POWER AUGER, HUH?

159
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:14,727
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SOMETHING
FOR THE DOG TO RIDE AROUND IN.

160
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:18,064
HOW ABOUT A GYMBAG?

161
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,233
HERE WE GO, GYMBAG.

162
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:23,102
WE CAN MAKE IT A "DOGGY BAG."

163
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:30,843
[auger motor running]

164
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,812
[crash!]

165
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,883
NOW, WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS
MOUNT THE AUGER OVER THERE.

166
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:38,718
THIS BECOMES YOUR
MERRY-GO-ROUND, SEE?

167
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,620
THAT'S WHY I PICKED HARD GROUND,

168
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,089
TO GET IT JAMMED UP INTO A ROCK.

169
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,457
IT'S PERFECT.

170
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,459
NOW, ALL WE GOT TO DO
IS JUST ADD OUR DOOR

171
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,528
AND OUR "DOGGY BAG."

172
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,332
WE'VE GOT OUR POOCH POUCH THERE
AND WE'VE GOT THE DOOR ON THERE.

173
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,800
AND I'VE GOT THE COUNTERWEIGHT.

174
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,602
SHE'S ALL PERFECTLY BALANCED.

175
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,371
ALL WE NEED IS THE DOG.

176
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,439
C'MON PRINCE, COME ON BOY.

177
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:03,509
HERE, PRINCE.

178
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:07,380
NO, PRINCE, HERE, COME HERE.

179
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,315
COME.

180
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:13,319
HERE, HERE.

181
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,889
I GUESS PRINCE REMEMBERED
WHERE HE LIVED.

182
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:20,526
SO, NOW, HE'S THE DOG
FORMERLY KNOWN AS PRINCE.

183
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,328
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
I GOT AN IDEA.

184
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,067
JUST USE THIS UNIT HERE.

185
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,669
THIS IS JUST LIKE A DOG.

186
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,438
IRISH SETTER, HUH?

187
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,040
ALL RIGHT, GOOD BOY.

188
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,875
STAY, STAY, SIT, SIT,
PLAY NICE, PLAY NICE.

189
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,377
GOOD BOY, GOOD BOY,
GOOD BOY, GOOD BOY.

190
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,446
THERE'LL BE A TREAT
FOR YOU LATER.

191
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:44,450
ALL WE GOT TO DO NOW IS START
'ER UP AND GIVE HIM A RIDE.

192
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,818
SO, REMEMBER...

193
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,286
"IF THE WOMEN DON'T
FIND YOU HANDSOME,"

194
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,988
"THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY."

195
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:53,092
[motor running]

196
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,627
[smash!]

197
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,135
I WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE AND TALK
TO SOME OF YOU MIDDLE AGED GUYS.

198
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,904
YOU KNOW, I READ SOMEWHERE

199
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,473
THAT PEOPLE TAKE LONGER TO
GET OUT OF THEIR PARKING SPACE

200
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,043
IF THEY KNOW THERE'S SOMEONE
THERE THAT WANTS THE SPACE.

201
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,715
NOW, IF YOU'RE LIKE ME,
AND I KNOW YOU ARE,

202
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:19,585
THEN, THIS IS NO BIG SURPRISE.

203
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,587
WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE,
HAVEN'T WE?

204
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:22,922
COMING OUT OF YOUR
PARKING SPACE,

205
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,690
YOU LOOK IN YOUR
REARVIEW MIRROR

206
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:27,526
AND THERE'S SOME DORK
WAITING FOR YOUR SPOT.

207
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:29,895
YOU JUST GET ANGRY,
JUST LIKE THAT,

208
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,731
FOR NO REASON AT ALL, REALLY.

209
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,234
AND YOU THINK: I'M GOING TO TAKE
MY OWN, SWEET TIME ON THIS.

210
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,638
MAYBE, POLISH THE HORN.

211
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:43,009
REFOLD ALL THE ROADMAPS
THE RIGHT WAY.

212
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,678
THE SCIENTISTS SAY THAT
THIS IS A HOLDOVER

213
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,714
FROM THE EVOLUTIONARY DAYS
OF THE OLD CAVEMAN, THERE.

214
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:50,816
WHERE THEY WOULD PROTECT
THEIR TERRITORY.

215
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,853
THINGS HAVE GOTTEN SO PITIFUL
THAT OUR TERRITORY NOW,

216
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,958
COMES DOWN TO TWO PARALLEL LINES
ON THE ASPHALT IN FRONT
OF THE 7-11.

217
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:02,261
SO, IT'S AN
EVOLUTIONARY PROBLEM.

218
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,765
SO THAT GUY, THE OTHER DRIVER,
IS JUST GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT
FOR US TO EVOLVE A LITTLE

219
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:09,168
AND BOY, THAT COULD
TAKE A WHILE.

220
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,970
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YA.

221
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,005
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

222
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,110
WELL, HAROLD'S BEEN
AT COLLEGE A WHOLE WEEK

223
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,745
AND HE DIDN'T CALL ME
TO COME AND GET HIM,

224
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:22,948
SO, I GUESS HE'S ADJUSTED TO
HAVING ALL THOSE WOMEN AROUND.

225
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,852
I KNOW HE WENT FOR AN EDUCATION,
BUT I BET HE'S GETTING MORE
THAN HE BARGAINED FOR.

226
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:38,497
[laughter and applause]

227
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,299
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU LOOK LIKE?

228
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,736
YOU LOOK LIKE THE GUY FROM
SATURDAY NIGHT FAVOUR.

229
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,671
FEVER - SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER.

230
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,374
WITH YOU, IT WOULD BE
A FAVOUR, I'M THINKING.

231
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,209
HOW'S IT GOING WITH
YOUR NEW ROOMMATES?

232
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,577
OH, GOOD, YEAH.

233
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:55,114
THEY SAID I'M NOT LIKE
ANY OTHER GUY THEY'VE
EVER MET.

234
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:58,017
THEY SAY, THEY FIND
ME NON-THREATENING.

235
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:01,854
SO, IT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU
THEY SIT AROUND WEARING
THEIR PYJAMAS, HAROLD,

236
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,956
OR HAVE THEIR
FRIENDS OVER,

237
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:08,661
OR BRUSH THEIR HAIR
IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR?

238
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,731
BRUSH THEIR HAIR,
HA! HA! HA!

239
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,399
I CAN'T EVEN SLEEP!!!

240
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,967
I'M GOING CRAZY!!!

241
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,202
THEY GOT CURVES,
UNCLE RED.

242
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,704
THEY TALK TO ME
WITH THEIR VOICES.

243
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,740
[ Hysterically]
I GET NO WORK DONE.

244
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,642
I CAN'T DO THE WORK.

245
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:28,881
THEY WALK AROUND
WITH THEIR LEGS.

246
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:33,753
UNCLE RED, YOU KNOW
WHEN THEY WALK?

247
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:37,189
THEIR LEGS MOVE.

248
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:43,696
HAROLD, COME ON OUTSIDE,
THE LAKE IS REALLY COLD.

249
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,731
OH GOOD!

250
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,303
ALL RIGHT, MEN,
IT'S NEW MEMBER NIGHT

251
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,405
AND ARNIE DOGAN,
THE LOCAL ROOFER,

252
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,942
HAS BROUGHT A FELLOW
HE'D LIKE TO PROPOSE.

253
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,112
LOOKS LIKE THIS GUY IS
A FEW SHINGLES SHORT
OF A DORMER TO ME.

254
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,714
TAKE 'ER AWAY, ARNIE.

255
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,382
THANKS, RED.

256
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,651
I'D LIKE TO PRESENT,
FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION,

257
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,487
A FELLOW WHO'S BEEN
WORKING WITH ME IN
THE ROOFING BUSINESS:

258
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,990
LOONIE.

259
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:14,026
ACTUALLY, IT'S
HECTOR SAMUELSON.

260
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:17,396
WE JUST CALL HIM LOONIE
BECAUSE HE FALLS SO FAST.

261
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,099
[laughter]

262
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,868
NOW, LOONIE'S GOT
MANY GOOD POINTS.

263
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,870
HE'S NOT AFRAID
OF ANYTHING

264
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,472
AND HE'S GOOD WITH
A HAMMER AND A NAIL.

265
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,007
YOU GIVE HIM A HAMMER,
A NAIL AND A SHINGLE

266
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,709
AND HE GETS INTO
A BIT MORE TROUBLE.

267
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,813
I SEE SOME OF YOU RECOGNIZE
LOONIE AS THE DRUMMER
IN MY BAND:

268
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,549
"ARNIE DOGAN AND
THE CHARTREUSE RIDERS...

269
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:40,786

MIDNIGHT RAMBLING BOYS."

271
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,224
SO, IF LOONEY GETS IN,

272
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,460
WE GET A FREE DRUMMER FOR ALL
THE LODGE WEDDINGS AND FUNERALS.

273
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:52,698
SO, THANKS FOR
YOUR CONSIDERATION.

274
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,500
ALL THOSE IN FAVOUR?

275
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,771
I SHOULD MENTION THAT
IF LOONEY DOESN'T GET IN,

276
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,775
I'LL BE SINGING PROTEST SONGS
IN FRONT OF THE LODGE,
24 HOURS A DAY.

277
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,076
ALL THOSE IN FAVOUR?

[lodge members]
AYE.

279
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:13,052
[narrated by Red]
I WAS UP BEHIND THE LODGE,
THINNING THE HERD,

280
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:16,455
AND I THOUGHT BILL WAS GOING
TO COME OUT AND HELP ME.

281
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,824
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.

282
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,893
DON'T, JUST DON'T!

283
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,563
BOY, YOU COULD GIVE
A GUY A HEART ATTACK.

284
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,265
YOU CHOP FOR AWHILE, BUD.

285
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:30,336
I'VE GOT TO RELAX.

286
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:33,038
NO, THE TREE'S OVER HERE, BILL.

287
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,473
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

288
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,242
OH, MY GOD!

289
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,143
YOU BROUGHT A CHAINSAW.

290
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,912
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

291

BILL, BILL.

292
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,016
BILL, EXCUSE ME, BILL.

293
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,286
THAT'S AN ELECTRIC CHAIN SAW.

294
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:57,296
GOT AN IDEA?

295
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,598
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?

296
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:02,001
OH, MY GOSH!

297
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,437
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE YOU
TO DRESS IN THE MORNING?

298
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,840
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO PLUG
THAT IN SOMEWHERE, BILL.

299
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,675
HOW IS THAT GOING TO WORK?

300
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,912
OH, ALL RIGHT.

301
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,081
SHE'S SHORTED OUT, BILL

302
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,584
YOU GOT A DEAD SHORT THERE.

303
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,986
IT'S PULLING ALL THE WIRING IN.

304
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,588
DON'T TOUCH IT, BILL.

305
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,156
BILL!!!

306
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:34,667
YOUR WIFE IS IN FOR
A SURPRISE TONIGHT, BILL.

00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:38,504
ALL RIGHT?

308
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,139
NOW, WHAT?

309
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:41,740
OKAY, WE'VE GOT NO AX,

310
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,709
WE'VE GOT NO ELECTRIC CHAINSAW.

311
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,244
OH, YOU GOT THE METAL JOB.

312
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:48,013
THERE'S A GAS ONE.

313
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,615
THERE YOU GO, ALL RIGHT, BILL.

314
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,116
START THAT ONE.

315
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:52,718
IT LOOKS LIKE A BEAUTY, EH?

316
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,620
START THAT BABY UP.

317
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,089
OH, THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

318
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:02,061
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

319
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:06,165
NOW, THAT'S FUNNY.

320
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,767
THERE WE GO, YOU GOT 'ER GOING.

321
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,503
BILL, YOU'VE GOT YOUR FOOT
THROUGH THE HANDLE.

322
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,871
GET YOUR FOOT OUT OF THERE.

323
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,707
GET YOUR FOOT OUT, BILL.

324
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,342
EASY, EASY, EASY.

325
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,744
OH, OH, OH, MAN!

326
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,717
WHERE DID SHE GO?

327
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:27,853
I'M FINE, ARE YOU OKAY?

328
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,556
I THINK I SEE IT,
I THINK I SEE IT.

329
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,725
OH, BOY!

330
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,660
OH, BILL.

331
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:39,331
OKAY, STAND STILL, STAND STILL!

332
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,600
IT'S A BOY!!!

333
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,203
OH NO, IT ISN'T.

334
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,112
UNCLE RED,
I'M SO IN LOVE.

335
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,680
I MET THIS GIRL.

336
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,149
IT'S PEEWEE HERMAN.

337
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,317
I MET THIS GIRL.

338
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,618
SHE'S TOTALLY AWESOME
AND TOTALLY COOL.

339
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,919
I MET HER AT
THE LAUNDROMAT.

340
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,421
WERE YOU WASHING
THAT OUTFIT?
YEAH.

341
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:04,089
DID YOU WASH IT WITH
YOUR RED LONGJOHNS?

342
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,892
YEAH, I DID ACTUALLY.

343
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,160
SHE'S SO COOL.

344
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,029
HER NAME'S HARRIET,
SHE'S SO COOL.

345
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,697
LIKE OZZIE AND HARRIET.

346
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:14,600
OZZY OSBOURNE
HAS A GIRLFRIEND
NAMED HARRIET?

347
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,936
OH, THAT'S THE NAME
OF THE BAT THAT HE
BIT THE HEAD OFF?

348
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:21,140
WHY DID I THINK
THAT WE COULD HAVE
A CONVERSATION, HAROLD?

349
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,408
SHE'S THE BEST.

350
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:23,909
OH REALLY?
YEAH.

351
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,778
HOW DOES SHE FEEL ABOUT
YOUR FEMALE ROOMMATES?

352
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:27,046
DID YOU TELL HER?

353
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:28,647
WELL, IT HASN'T COME UP
IN CONVERSATION, YET.

354
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:29,982
SO, NO.

355
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,250
BUT, SHE WON'T
MIND, RIGHT?

356
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,418
BECAUSE THESE ARE
MODERN TIMES.

357
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:34,319
ABSOLUTELY,
SHE WON'T MIND.

358
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,755
I'LL TELL HER
THE NEXT TIME
I SEE HER.

359
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:40,726
YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE MODERN, LIBERATED WOMAN.

360
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,562
SHE WILL BE TOTALLY
COOL WITH THIS.

361
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:47,199
SHE'LL BE WAY PAST COOL,
ALL THE WAY TO FROSTY,
I WOULD SAY.

362
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:51,036
[laughter]

363
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,740
THIS IS THE REPAIR PART
OF THE SHOW THAT WE CALL:

364
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,709
"IF IT AIN'T BROKE,
YOU'RE NOT TRYING."

365
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,546
WE'VE GOT WATER TAXI DRIVER
HAP SHAUGHNESEY HERE TODAY.

366
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,247
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
FOR US TODAY, HAP?

367
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,683
WELL, I'VE GOT AN
OLD PAINTING, RED.

368
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,721
IT'S GOT A BIT
OF A TEAR, THERE.

369
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,090
NOW BE CAREFUL.

370
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:13,559
THIS IS A FAMILY HEIRLOOM.

371
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,727
GOES BACK A WAY, DOES IT?

372
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:20,199
THIS LADY HAS BEEN
IN OUR FAMILY SINCE
THE 16TH CENTURY.

373
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:25,337
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT TO SAY, HAP.

374
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:29,374
JUST TELL ME YOU CAN
FIX THE TEAR, RED.

375
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,676
OH YEAH, THE TEAR.

376
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:33,512
I CAN FIX THE RIP OFF - RIP UP.

377
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:36,381
I'LL PUT SOMETHING ON THERE
THAT WILL LAST ANOTHER
FIVE CENTURIES.

378
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,685
I'M THINKING OF
THE RENAISSANCE MAN'S
SECRET WEAPON:

379
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:42,454
DUCT TAPE.

380
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:47,092
THIS PAINTING LOOKS A LOT LIKE
THE MONA LISA BY DA VINCI?

381
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,528
I DON'T KNOW
THE DETAILS.

382
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,498
I JUST KNOW, SHE'S
BEEN IN OUR FAMILY

383
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:56,568
SINCE THE SHAUGHNESSEYS
LIVED IN FLORENCE IN 1510.

384
00:18:56,635 --> 00:19:03,175
YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE THERE'S
AN IMITATION OF THIS PAINTING
HANGING IN THE LOUVRE, IN PARIS.

385
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:06,979
[laughter]

386
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:10,883
YEAH, THAT'S
ALSO AN ORIGINAL.

387
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,684
OH, THERE'S THE TWO ORIGINALS.

388
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,119
I SEE, I SEE.

389
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:15,988
LEONARDO DID A COUPLE OF THESE
AND THIS IS THE BETTER ONE

390
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:19,324
BECAUSE HE DID IT ON
GLOSSY, POSTER PAPER.

391
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:22,961
OR MAYBE, HE INVENTED
THE COLOUR PHOTO COPIER

392
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:26,899
AND JUST DIDN'T
TELL ANYBODY.

393
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,401
NO, THIS IS A POSTER.

394
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:32,671
I GOT IT IN THE FRAME SHOP
IN PORT ASBESTOS.

395
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,274
SO, THIS PAINTING HASN'T
BEEN IN YOUR FAMILY
FOR FIVE CENTURIES?

396
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,742
OH, NO, NO, NO.

397
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:39,778
I SAID THE LADY HAS.

398
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,880
THIS LADY MARRIED MY...

399
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,716
GREAT, GREAT, GREAT,
GREAT, GREAT, GREAT,
GREAT, GREAT, GREAT,

400
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,552
GREAT, GREAT...

401
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,820
YEAH, YEAH.

402
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:54,793
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
MONA LISA'S LAST NAME
WAS SHAUGHNESSEY?

403
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,261
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?
HAVE A LOOK.

404
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:59,231
LOOK AT THE FAMILY RESEMBLENCE.

405
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:02,367
[laughter]

406
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,937
BOY, I DON'T KNOW HOW
SHE KEEPS A STRAIGHT FACE.

407
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,941
Red:
OH, BOY!
HE'S BACK TO NORMAL.

408
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:10,375
WHAT WENT WRONG, HAROLD?

409
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:11,577
I BROKE UP
WITH HARRIET.

410
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,045
SHE'S NOT MY TYPE.

411
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,313
WOW, YOU HAVE A TYPE?

412
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,915
LIKE A FONT OR SOMETHING?

413
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,517
SHE SAID: "OH, I DON'T CARE
IF YOU LIVE WITH THREE GIRLS."

414
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:19,518
WHY SHOULD I?

415
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,019
I LIVE WITH FOUR GUYS.

416
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,621
FOUR GUYS!!!

417
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,389
WELL HAROLD,
IT'S MODERN TIMES.

418
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:25,724
WELL, TIMES UP!

419
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,160
FOUR GUYS!!!

420
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,828
YOU KNOW, HAROLD,
YOU'RE STARTING TO
SOUND LIKE A MAN TO ME.

421
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,731
I THINK YOU COULD BE
A POSSUM LODGE MEMBER.

422
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,132
OH, NO!

423
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,567
I'VE GOT TO
PHONE HARRET.

424
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,102
I'VE GOT TO APOLOGIZE.

425
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,937
I'M BEING TOTALLY UNREASONABLE.

426
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,639
DON'T CALL HER,
DON'T CALL HER.

427
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,074
NO, I TRUST HER, UNCLE RED.

428
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,076
I THINK WE COULD MAKE UP
AND WE COULD FIX THINGS

429
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:45,110
AND EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

430
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,045
NO, I MEAN IT'S LONG DISTANCE.

431
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,251
HELLO, HARRIET, DON'T HANG UP.

432
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:55,187
I JUST WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR THE THINGS I SAID.

433
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,725
OH, REALLY!

434
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,194
WHAT?

435
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,930
NO, THAT WAS THE CRY
OF THE POSSUM.

436
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,166
IT'S MEETING TIME,
SO I GOT TO GO,

437
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,968
BUT I'LL SEE YOU AT SCHOOL.

438
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,637
OKAY, YOU TOO.

439
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:14,406
BYE.

440
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:15,974
[squeal of the Possum]

441
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,676
IT REALLY IS
METTING TIME.

442
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:21,179
HAROLD, I THINK YOU
DID THE RIGHT THING
WITH HARRIET.

443
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:23,215
REALLY?
YEAH?

444
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,917
OH, NO.
C'MON, NOW.

445
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,586
IT WAS SO CLOSE.

446
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,589
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

447
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,324
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

448
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:33,792
AND I THINK WE SHOULD APPRECIATE

449
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,227
THAT WE GREW UP
IN SIMPLER TIMES.

450
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,863
BEFORE THERE WAS "FREE LOVE"
AND "POLITICAL CORRECTNESS."

451
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:42,000
AND, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO TREAT
ANYBODY FAIRLY UNTIL YOU WERE
FORCED TO, THROUGH MARRIAGE.

452
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,702
AND TO THE REST OF YOU:

453
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,238
THANKS FOR WATCHING AND ON
BEHALF OF MYSELF AND HAROLD,

454
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,307
AND THE WHOLE GANG
AT POSSUM LODGE.

455
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,542
"KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE."

456
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:53,278
[applause]

457
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:04,523
ALL RISE.

458
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:11,663
[lodge members]
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI.

459
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,399
NOW, YOU ALL KNOW THAT
I HAVE A NEW GIRLFRIEND

460
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,068
AND SHE PHONES ME ALL THE TIME.

461
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:18,136
WITH IMPORTANT MATTERS
AND ISSUES, AND STUFF.

462
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:21,807
SO, DON'T CLOG UP MY VOICE MAIL
WITH YOUR INSULTS AND ADVICE.

463
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:24,209
MR. HATFIELD,
YOU QUIT PHONING TOO.

464
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:27,346
THAT'S THE WORST BEA ARTHUR
IMPRESSION I'VE EVER HEARD.

465
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,448
