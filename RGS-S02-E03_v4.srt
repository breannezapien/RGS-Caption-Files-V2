1
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:07,774
[quirky upbeat music]

2
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:44,544
If all the world's a stage, then we all must
work for Wells Fargo, Dennis Wells Fargo and

3
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:45,512
I don't work for them.

4
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:46,713
I will. I'm up here.

5
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,382
I'm producing and directing this television
show for my uncle,

6
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,651
And I love doing it for a lot of reasons.

7
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:54,654
But I guess lack of alternatives would be
pretty close to the top.

8
00:00:55,154 --> 00:00:57,390
It's pretty close to the top and lack of it.

9
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,559
Here's Map Knuckle.

10
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:01,261
The star of the Red Green Show.

11
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:03,863
Here he is, Mr. Red Green.

12
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:10,403
Thank you. Welcome to Possum Lodge, where men
are men and Harold is understudying.

13
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:13,973
Tell them what you can do if you're a
tasteless gimmick machine there, Harold.

14
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:16,242
Oh, you mean my special effects axe?

15
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:20,413
Just a little taste of Hollywood.

16
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:22,749
Hopefully not a lethal dose.

17
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,984
Setting up the lodge last night.

18
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:28,655
Bunch of us were sitting around the wood
stove talking about the differences between

19
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,290
people and how irritating that can be.

20
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,427
And we got some members here who have a big
conniption over the least little thing.

21
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:37,463
And then on the other end of the spectrum,
you get somebody like old man Sedgwick.

22
00:01:37,463 --> 00:01:40,533
You can stroll down to the dock with his
pants on fire and check the temperature of

23
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:41,801
the water before he jumps in the lake.

24
00:01:42,568 --> 00:01:44,003
That's probably because he uses his pant

25
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:45,171
Cuffs as an ashtray.

26
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:50,276
Why does he do that? Well, I think an old
man, Sedgwick, the part from the ankles down

27
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,411
is the smoking section.

28
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,080
Anyway, we all have a squash button.

29
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,348
Our pants once in a while, don't we?

30
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,054
But you know, it's it's it's kind of funny
if you're going to play a trick on somebody,

31
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:03,623
you don't you don't pick somebody who isn't
going to get upset.

32
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:06,659
You know, you go to the guy who's going to
give you the the biggest reaction.

33
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:11,064
So it's kind of strange that the fellows who
are the ones who don't want to be bothered at

34
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,498
all are the ones that get bothered all the
time.

35
00:02:13,232 --> 00:02:14,333
That's ironic, isn't it?

36
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:17,870
It's mean. Same thing, Harold, I guess.

37
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,307
You know, the two exceptions of that have to
be a helmet, winter garden and Moose

38
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,376
Thompson, because these guys are huge.

39
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:26,446
And when they get upset, they have a habit
of ripping your head off and throwing it down

40
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:27,113
the two hole or.

41
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:32,351
Well, with that visual fresh in our minds,
why don't we just move on to the next

42
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:34,754
segment, you know, unless of course, you
have a point to make.

43
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:37,423
Whereas when I get upset, I fire people,

44
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:40,526
You know, you can always take your time and
feel like you're right

45
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:42,762
In the next segment. Would you, Harold?

46
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:43,896
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

47
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:53,839
Whatever you like, sir. You know, Harold, I
can remember the days when we'd catch so

48
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:58,644
many fish on Possum Lake at the water level
had dropped six feet or better.

49
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,914
No way, no possible way that could happen.

50
00:03:01,914 --> 00:03:04,317
And then the fish would be in the boat with
you, causing

51
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:07,987
Them to displace his own weight in water,
resulting in a zero net change in the

52
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,221
perceived volume of the lake.

53
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:11,190
What do you say about that? What do you say
about that?

54
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,627
Well, all I know is that the water level went
down eight feet.

55
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,130
You said six. I was just being conservative
in case you questioned me.

56
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:19,999
Now I see the hell with it.

57
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,303
The water level was down at least 10 feet.

58
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:30,776
We came in on our boats and our prop cut all
the water lines and the fishing boat went

59
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:32,345
right underneath the dock.

60
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:36,916
Yep, all I got to show for it, of course,
was a bump on the head and a face full of

61
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:41,053
spiders, which I killed by slapping them
with a speckled trout.

62
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:43,823
Sounds like quite a date. Oh golly.

63
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:51,497
My Robert Goulet albums are missing all of
them.

64
00:03:52,064 --> 00:03:53,165
Even the best stuff.

65
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:57,069
Well, that's good news. I'm just kidding,
Ed.

66
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,138
Bob Goulet is a friend of mine.

67
00:04:00,973 --> 00:04:03,109
What did you do with them? Duck me.

68
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,112
I wouldn't touch Old Bob Wills albums.

69
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,181
Heck, the Bob Meister and I were like
brothers.

70
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:12,451
I know it was. You duck.

71
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:16,889
Last month you took my special clipper for
four unsightly nose and deer hairs.

72
00:04:17,022 --> 00:04:19,658
And you always put down me and my showbiz
aspirations.

73
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:24,096
By Robert Goulet. Albums are missing there.

74
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:26,232
They're gone. They're just gone.

75
00:04:26,298 --> 00:04:27,800
Oh, not a problem.

76
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:32,872
Why don't you just get old doc there to send
down to his friend Bobby Goulet?

77
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,240
Maybe he'll send them up and said, Huh?

78
00:04:34,773 --> 00:04:36,075
You will bob bow Mr.

79
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,511
Hop before the level in here sinks another
eight feet.

80
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:42,214
So I hear there's been a theft by Robert
Goulet albums.

81
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,516
Still, technically it is theft.

82
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:46,418
Can you describe the stolen items?

83
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:47,953
Well, I can. I can.

84
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,225
They're around had a hole in the center and
they just slightly off center.

85
00:04:53,225 --> 00:04:54,326
A lot like Eddie here.

86
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,264
Do you have any suspects? There's your man?

87
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:01,166
Eddie things-I took the albums.

88
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,402
We all know it was Elvis who did it.

89
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,339
Well, we're going to treat me like a fool.

90
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:13,846
I would think of offering a reward if the
recipient were willing to donate the money to

91
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:17,516
the Possum Lake Little Theater Group, which
I would start as soon as I received the

92
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:21,987
money. Are you going to need a bodyguard or
some sort of personal protection?

93
00:05:22,621 --> 00:05:23,856
I don't think so.

94
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:25,958
He will, if he goes ahead, have that little
theater thing.

95
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:39,271
I love seeing lipstick in various

96
00:05:39,271 --> 00:05:39,772
Shades

97
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,412
From Ruby Red through purple into that like
pink stuff that Joey Heathers more in earlier

98
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:52,551
days. The sight of lipstick makes my libido
take action.

99
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:58,557
Mind you, when Uncle Bob wears lipstick, I
almost always have a completely different

100
00:05:58,557 --> 00:05:59,825
reaction. But still.

101
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:14,606
This week on Handymen Corner, we're going to
show you what you can do with all those old

102
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:17,476
hot water heaters you got sitting out on
your front porch.

103
00:06:18,243 --> 00:06:21,880
I know it's kind of fun just to watch them
rust out as the seasons come and go, but

104
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:25,784
maybe there's something better that you
could do for yourself or your neighbor.

105
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:31,590
For all of mankind or just yourself, you
ever never looked at a hot water heater.

106
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,991
I mean, really looked at one.

107
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,261
Because when I look at it, I don't see a hot
water heater.

108
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:39,498
I see a twelve thousand cup coffee maker.

109
00:06:40,632 --> 00:06:42,801
I see the world's most private phone booth.

110
00:06:43,835 --> 00:06:44,937
I see a lawn roller.

111
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,104
I see a beer cooler.

112
00:06:46,705 --> 00:06:48,440
I see a dandy place to keep magnets.

113
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:52,377
More importantly, I see a project.

114
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:57,649
Now you're going to need an egg beater, an
aquarium, an oxygen tank and a very

115
00:06:57,649 --> 00:06:59,017
understanding insurance agent.

116
00:07:01,553 --> 00:07:03,288
I guess they're not laughing now, are they?

117
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:06,091
We build ourselves a one man sub.

118
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:08,760
No, I, that's the top part off here.

119
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:13,298
What you do now is take that aquarium that I
mentioned and invert that, turn it over and

120
00:07:13,298 --> 00:07:18,337
put her on here and make it sealed off with,
say, silicone caulking or even duct tape as

121
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:21,473
long as it's watertight. If you don't have
an aquarium, you could use one of those Pyrex

122
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:23,709
roasting pans. So your choice, really?

123
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:29,881
So there you are along the way, down to the
bottom of the ocean floor and you can propel

124
00:07:29,881 --> 00:07:31,550
yourself forward with manual power.

125
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:37,089
They would do this once in a while.

126
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:37,489
You go

127
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:38,690
Up periscope.

128
00:07:43,361 --> 00:07:45,363
I don't really understand a periscope.

129
00:07:45,597 --> 00:07:52,170
And then when you want to rise to the
surface, you just drop your ballast and up

130
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,271
you go, it's that simple.

131
00:07:53,805 --> 00:07:56,041
And I got her mounted here on the launching
ramp.

132
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:58,777
You just slide this down into the water.

133
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:02,013
But of course, it's not going to go anywhere
now because I got the wedges in place, but

134
00:08:02,013 --> 00:08:04,583
it's just that simple. Then there's a lot of
fun, and I think you're going to really enjoy

135
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:08,153
your hot water heater. So remember, the
women don't find you handsome, they should at

136
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:09,187
least find you handy.

137
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:11,223
I did remember to put those wedges in
tonight.

138
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:32,677
It is summer, I shall never see a sky so
blue.

139
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:40,418
I shall never see a cloud so white, I shall
never see another day like because I looked

140
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:41,987
into the sun with binoculars.

141
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:53,331
Wow, now we got Eddie in a real flap over
his missing albums and with Doc as a suspect,

142
00:08:53,398 --> 00:08:54,833
you never really know where you stand.

143
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:58,503
It's not that doc lie so much, it's just to
embellish, embellishes the truth to the point

144
00:08:58,503 --> 00:09:00,171
where it's unrecognizable.

145
00:09:00,572 --> 00:09:03,975
Kind of like buying a Hyundai pony fully
loaded manager.

146
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:05,677
You should never buy anything when you're
fully loaded.

147
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:08,847
Well, not to worry, I'll go read the novels
on the case.

148
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,016
He's got all the private detective equipment
he's going to need.

149
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:12,851
You got it from the back of a comic book at

150
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:14,986
A nose from the back of the comic book out
here.

151
00:09:16,821 --> 00:09:21,292
Anyway, is another guy who gets real upset,
so adding him to the mix is kind of fun to,

152
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:23,495
you know, old man Sedgwick now.

153
00:09:23,661 --> 00:09:27,098
He says he never touched the LP, but he's
offered a reward to anybody who steals the

154
00:09:27,098 --> 00:09:31,503
rest of them. Sticky Peterson says he
doesn't think the records are going to turn

155
00:09:31,503 --> 00:09:34,639
up, but just to be on the safe side, he
smashed the record player.

156
00:09:35,473 --> 00:09:37,675
Of course, all these things are just bugging
the crap out, Eddie.

157
00:09:37,675 --> 00:09:39,344
So I'm I'm more or less in favor of them.

158
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:43,314
You know, rat, I find this all incredibly
childish and irresponsible.

159
00:09:43,314 --> 00:09:44,382
That's my opinion.

160
00:09:44,983 --> 00:09:47,852
Well, Harold, if you can't stay young, you
can only stay immature.

161
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:52,457
You know, I wonder if I'm ever going to be
able to continue taking part in this life.

162
00:09:53,358 --> 00:09:54,425
Don't tease me, Harold.

163
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:06,237
Why it's always so much colder up this end,
the league

164
00:10:09,941 --> 00:10:10,341
There,

165
00:10:12,076 --> 00:10:14,779
It's mean all do I order fries through this
thing to

166
00:10:15,313 --> 00:10:17,048
Get identification?

167
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:20,118
Well, I have my body.

168
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:21,219
How many, Zach? How far?

169
00:10:21,786 --> 00:10:23,755
We didn't have a perfect storm.

170
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:26,157
Oh, cats.

171
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:29,994
Oh, just a second.

172
00:10:41,606 --> 00:10:43,274
Expecting relatives, perhaps

173
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:53,284
A theft, which means a thief walks amongst us
a little extra security would be a prudent

174
00:10:53,284 --> 00:10:55,053
response for everyone except for said thief.

175
00:10:55,053 --> 00:10:55,820
Would it not?

176
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:57,555
Well, I'll take my chances.

177
00:10:57,588 --> 00:10:57,922
No.

178
00:10:58,022 --> 00:11:01,059
Ok, that is a victim mentality.

179
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:02,727
No wonder your life's a disaster.

180
00:11:03,428 --> 00:11:09,100
Me, I'm confronted by a thief that would
make my day, you know, red.

181
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:13,571
I have the strength and training to reach
right into a man's chest.

182
00:11:13,805 --> 00:11:17,108
Rip his heart out and hand it back to him
before he dies.

183
00:11:19,477 --> 00:11:21,079
Oh, imagine that.

184
00:11:21,212 --> 00:11:23,281
Oh, sick.

185
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:25,083
Oh, Lucian, in your hand.

186
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:27,919
I wear a glove, I guess.

187
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:37,195
Starship entry number four, oh, six, a
reminder, wear a glove when you're doing that

188
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:41,933
heart ripping thing. Well, I'm ready for
him.

189
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:42,667
What's your plan?

190
00:11:43,334 --> 00:11:46,838
Well, my plan is I don't have anything worth
stealing kind of an ounce of prevention thing

191
00:11:46,838 --> 00:11:47,238
I do.

192
00:11:47,972 --> 00:11:48,973
There's a double impact.

193
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,375
No? Well, good luck.

194
00:11:51,843 --> 00:11:56,981
Great theater was crowded, wasn't all.

195
00:11:57,915 --> 00:12:01,552
But I come by because I want you to see if
you could find what happened to Eddie's

196
00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:04,589
record. You know, you're like searching
around in garbage and stuff.

197
00:12:05,423 --> 00:12:13,431
Light years ahead. You read Item eight, a
letter to Doc Render from a certain lady

198
00:12:13,431 --> 00:12:13,865
friend.

199
00:12:14,865 --> 00:12:18,102
Where'd you find that? Oh, oh.

200
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:21,505
So you also have the training to reach into
a man's mailbox and take a letter?

201
00:12:22,873 --> 00:12:24,742
I don't want. Where is it?

202
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:28,646
It's in my good pants, but I wrote one
myself.

203
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:30,581
I have authority. It's in the charter.

204
00:12:31,182 --> 00:12:32,316
Well, I think you better get that back to
talk.

205
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:35,086
All in good time.

206
00:12:35,853 --> 00:12:37,989
This is potential evidence.

207
00:12:39,123 --> 00:12:43,160
There are several overt references to the
golden era of musical comedy.

208
00:12:44,562 --> 00:12:50,301
We hear that Doc stole those records, and he
set them as a gift to his pen pal in the

209
00:12:50,301 --> 00:12:52,069
Philippines. You want me to run that one
now?

210
00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:54,372
No, not really. No.

211
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:56,574
You're a sack of fat, right?

212
00:12:57,608 --> 00:13:00,444
Not mentally and physically, especially
physically.

213
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,885
Me, I'm a rock star freak like a rock.

214
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:14,759
Great album. Well, I'll do the tough thing
and I'll phone the woman.

215
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:17,061
I'll find out your answer and probably won't
even thank me

216
00:13:17,628 --> 00:13:18,662
How you got that right now.

217
00:13:20,131 --> 00:13:23,167
That's why they say there's a thousand Fred
MacMurray for every one.

218
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:24,001
Clint Eastwood.

219
00:13:26,437 --> 00:13:28,038
Well, from the neck up anyway.

220
00:13:35,913 --> 00:13:37,481
Oh, great.

221
00:13:52,163 --> 00:13:59,870
That's. Thank you, Bill.

222
00:14:01,272 --> 00:14:05,009
This week we're going to build a campfire,
and one thing you should know was we're doing

223
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:09,747
it where there have been a lot of pesticides
that didn't really occur to us at the moment.

224
00:14:10,614 --> 00:14:17,254
Thank you again. But that's the of an
slinked into the ground.

225
00:14:17,388 --> 00:14:23,193
Pretty heavy there. Over the last 60, 70, 80
years or so, it seemed like a good place for

226
00:14:23,193 --> 00:14:25,629
us to build a campfire, not going to burn
any brush or anything.

227
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,631
We're just trying to get some kindling
together here.

228
00:14:28,565 --> 00:14:30,034
Bill's using the psi, kind of.

229
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:33,203
I don't have time for things like sore eyes
I.

230
00:14:34,638 --> 00:14:37,274
I kind of like a real good, a real good
accent like out there.

231
00:14:37,574 --> 00:14:44,615
Oh, it breaks up the kindling and burns a
lot better, and it's just nice to around that

232
00:14:45,616 --> 00:14:47,051
kind of a fun thing that I do.

233
00:14:48,285 --> 00:14:48,819
Is it do?

234
00:14:48,986 --> 00:14:53,657
Oh, it's hard to stick anything into the
ground because there's so much chemical in

235
00:14:53,657 --> 00:14:56,226
there. There's very little soil.

236
00:14:56,827 --> 00:15:00,931
So anyway, we got the the big lungs bill's
going to lighter up there and

237
00:15:02,099 --> 00:15:06,270
To match Colin Quinn bill for gonorrhea.

238
00:15:08,772 --> 00:15:14,278
Actionscript, but you know, we could we could
feel heat coming off off the fire, and it

239
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:16,346
wasn't even going yet, and that's that's
very peculiar.

240
00:15:17,981 --> 00:15:22,119
But here again, I guess what was happening
was that, gosh, some of those some of those

241
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:25,255
pesticides and what have you apparently were
were flammable.

242
00:15:27,491 --> 00:15:30,794
We were we were in a very confused at this
point because we couldn't we could feel the

243
00:15:30,794 --> 00:15:32,429
heat and we could see we could smell smoke.

244
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:34,598
But there wasn't any. Oh, yes, there was.

245
00:15:34,598 --> 00:15:35,833
Yes, there was a fire there.

246
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,100
Oh, I see. Yeah, yeah.

247
00:15:37,234 --> 00:15:38,535
Yeah. Hmm. Mm hmm.

248
00:15:39,937 --> 00:15:43,240
But, you know, Bill always looks on the
bright side, and then he figures that's going

249
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,808
to save him a lot of money and matches

250
00:15:47,044 --> 00:15:47,277
All that,

251
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:49,880
And then he thought maybe he should just put
it out.

252
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,219
You know, he's he's a trained firefighter
bill is I don't think that's how you put out

253
00:15:55,219 --> 00:15:56,386
a chemical fire in London.

254
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,222
And then he got a good idea.

255
00:15:58,222 --> 00:16:03,293
If you can't get your wood to get on fire,
you move your wood over to where the fire is.

256
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:14,004
No hair that was going up and down the TV
channels.

257
00:16:14,972 --> 00:16:16,640
They saw that music video one.

258
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,341
They got there.

259
00:16:17,374 --> 00:16:18,842
Oh, yeah, yeah. Have you ever seen that
before?

260
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:23,080
Well, yeah, I've seen it before, but you
know, I always thought there was something

261
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,983
wrong with it. I mean, the pictures change
is about forty eight times a second.

262
00:16:25,983 --> 00:16:27,918
I thought, maybe you needed a D Scrambler,
you know,

263
00:16:29,353 --> 00:16:32,155
That's the way music videos are fast cutting
lots of

264
00:16:32,155 --> 00:16:33,690
Images. What do you mean?

265
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,326
How do you mean? I mean, what do you mean?

266
00:16:36,326 --> 00:16:37,995
I mean, I mean, what's the point of it, you
know?

267
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:39,963
Well, it's an art form, isn't it?

268
00:16:40,297 --> 00:16:44,468
You know, I directed my best friend's music
video for his band, The Slugs of Attila.

269
00:16:44,701 --> 00:16:45,736
That's the band's name, right?

270
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:48,772
They used to be called gaping wound, but
that guy left the group right.

271
00:16:48,872 --> 00:16:51,174
So they don't explain that to me.

272
00:16:51,241 --> 00:16:51,908
Oh, OK.

273
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:54,578
You see music videos have lots of images,
right?

274
00:16:54,945 --> 00:16:59,282
See that way. They contrast the lyrics,
definitely adding hidden meanings and

275
00:16:59,282 --> 00:17:01,885
poignancy and women in underwear.

276
00:17:01,985 --> 00:17:03,620
That's a very important motif.

277
00:17:05,288 --> 00:17:06,623
Really? Yeah.

278
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:10,327
Well, I watch for about 20 minutes, and I
can't remember one thing that I saw.

279
00:17:10,327 --> 00:17:12,929
You know, I looked like the camera was
attached to one of them machines.

280
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:14,764
They used to shake up your paint at the
hardware store.

281
00:17:16,266 --> 00:17:18,969
It's very easy to remember music videos only
have three elements.

282
00:17:19,002 --> 00:17:24,174
One women with huge cleavages to a guy
standing in a pile of rubble singing or

283
00:17:24,174 --> 00:17:27,844
three. It would be, and probably the most
popular of all, people fighting.

284
00:17:28,145 --> 00:17:30,514
That's all I got to remember is those three,
unless, of course, it's a country and

285
00:17:30,514 --> 00:17:33,783
western. Then there's going to be like a guy
in a horse and a woman sitting on a fence.

286
00:17:33,783 --> 00:17:35,252
You know, it was heavy metal.

287
00:17:35,252 --> 00:17:37,454
There's going to be like a guy in a
Burned-out factory singing.

288
00:17:37,454 --> 00:17:40,357
That's where they do those. And of course,
if it's rap, it's going to be like in front

289
00:17:40,357 --> 00:17:42,926
of a brick wall, a guy yelling, That's how
you tell the difference.

290
00:17:44,594 --> 00:17:48,331
Well, the one I saw, I didn't have any
horses, didn't have any shaking camera,

291
00:17:48,331 --> 00:17:49,733
didn't have any factories, OK?

292
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,104
Had the women with the big cleavages and it
had a lot of men shouting and fighting.

293
00:17:54,237 --> 00:17:55,405
Well, yeah, see that.

294
00:17:55,438 --> 00:17:57,974
That's an opera. Oh.

295
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:14,024
So that is turning the whole larger part, you
know, looking and looking for these missing

296
00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:16,993
out, or at least I've been told I don't see
any difference.

297
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,164
I guess there's no harm done with this
missing album business, but it has.

298
00:18:21,164 --> 00:18:23,833
It has drawn a lot of attention to Bob Gale
and that bothers me a little.

299
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:28,204
Hopefully, we'll get the whole mess
straightened out at tonight's lodge meeting.

300
00:18:28,238 --> 00:18:30,940
We we'd all hate to think we had a thief
among us.

301
00:18:31,307 --> 00:18:35,278
We know we have a womanizer, a liar, three
con artists, two bullies and a tightwad.

302
00:18:35,645 --> 00:18:38,982
I don't think that's a very respectful way to
talk about your fellow lodge members.

303
00:18:39,582 --> 00:18:41,251
Oh yeah, and a socially challenged idiot.

304
00:18:41,251 --> 00:18:42,285
Thanks for reminding me, Harold.

305
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:47,924
You know, a thief is something else and
unsurprising, considering we have nothing of

306
00:18:47,924 --> 00:18:49,225
any value up here at the Lodge.

307
00:18:49,426 --> 00:18:53,897
I mean, other than the intangibles, you
know, friendships and and petty jealousies.

308
00:18:53,897 --> 00:18:57,333
And I guess the arm wrestling, you wouldn't
want a thief to mess any of that up.

309
00:18:57,534 --> 00:18:58,735
I don't get it. I'll go rat hawk.

310
00:18:58,735 --> 00:19:02,138
I'm like, You know, you guys are always
borrowing stuff from each other than wrecking

311
00:19:02,138 --> 00:19:04,441
it, then returning it. You know, what's the
big difference?

312
00:19:04,441 --> 00:19:05,809
Really big difference, Harold.

313
00:19:05,975 --> 00:19:07,977
I mean, number one, you get it back when
it's totaled.

314
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:11,648
And number two, you can then borrow
something from that guy and mangle it,

315
00:19:12,015 --> 00:19:14,250
especially if you're a little upset, huh?

316
00:19:14,918 --> 00:19:17,754
There's so much to being a man that I have
yet to really understand.

317
00:19:19,522 --> 00:19:20,990
Oh, there it is. That's the call of the
meeting.

318
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:23,493
Come on, uncle. Rent the day of reckoning.

319
00:19:23,493 --> 00:19:25,361
Let's get down there and find out what's
going on.

320
00:19:25,361 --> 00:19:26,429
Yeah. Ok, Harold.

321
00:19:26,796 --> 00:19:31,000
Well, we'll be able to probably straighten
this album thing out pretty, pretty quickly,

322
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,004
and then we can all get back to our normal
lives, with the exception of Harold for

323
00:19:35,004 --> 00:19:35,805
obvious reasons.

324
00:19:37,106 --> 00:19:44,113
Three, three, three or

325
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:53,723
five? All right.

326
00:20:00,563 --> 00:20:10,440
Because now, Simon Theodore, I seem pretty
anxious here, ready to find your albums.

327
00:20:10,807 --> 00:20:11,975
That's not funny.

328
00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:16,012
We can prove that Thug stole them.

329
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:17,213
I didn't take them.

330
00:20:17,213 --> 00:20:19,015
You took them, Mr. I didn't take them.

331
00:20:19,515 --> 00:20:24,354
Give it a rest. What about this lady friend
in the Philippines?

332
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:28,491
Huh? I don't have any lady friend in the
Philippines, and I didn't take the stupid

333
00:20:28,491 --> 00:20:31,127
albums, huh? I thought something like that.

334
00:20:32,061 --> 00:20:36,099
Maybe, maybe Redd would like to make a
comment about that letter I showed you

335
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:36,933
earlier today.

336
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,837
I sure want that letter was none of Noel's
damn business.

337
00:20:41,404 --> 00:20:42,438
Hey, hey, hey.

338
00:20:42,605 --> 00:20:44,507
What's sauce for the goose red?

339
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,577
No. Took that letter because Duck took my
albums.

340
00:20:48,311 --> 00:20:53,216
I did not. Several large members saw you
pick up stuff on Eddie's room last night,

341
00:20:53,282 --> 00:20:55,318
huh? I was borrowing a pillow.

342
00:20:56,953 --> 00:20:57,987
The gate, you understand.

343
00:20:58,154 --> 00:20:59,522
Are you not listening?

344
00:21:00,156 --> 00:21:01,724
Read my lips.

345
00:21:01,757 --> 00:21:04,560
I did not take the album.

346
00:21:05,061 --> 00:21:08,631
We found an album cover under your bed.

347
00:21:09,298 --> 00:21:10,500
All right. Sure.

348
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,905
I took it, and I even know you took them.

349
00:21:16,606 --> 00:21:17,607
You took them because you want to make a
gift.

350
00:21:18,407 --> 00:21:20,042
I did not. So you did.

351
00:21:20,076 --> 00:21:21,310
Well, I didn't. They did.

352
00:21:21,344 --> 00:21:22,678
All right. I did. Sure. You got me there.

353
00:21:22,812 --> 00:21:27,450
All right. Yeah, I put them because I wanted
to make a gift to Freddie.

354
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:33,923
No, I wanted to make something for you out
of the album.

355
00:21:35,558 --> 00:21:38,761
Oh, sure. Well, where is it?

356
00:21:39,695 --> 00:21:44,066
Oh, well, I'm not exactly sure where the dog
got picked out here.

357
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,303
Oh, wow.

358
00:21:47,603 --> 00:21:51,007
I mean, it's a it's an order of trade.

359
00:21:58,914 --> 00:22:00,349
It's it's beautiful.

360
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,119
I don't know what to say.

361
00:22:04,353 --> 00:22:07,757
Thank you for all the stock.

362
00:22:09,425 --> 00:22:12,862
You know, I thought we could have a barbecue
themed dinner one night, you know, would fill

363
00:22:12,862 --> 00:22:15,264
the tray with chunks of ham and we could all
wear album covers.

364
00:22:15,398 --> 00:22:17,166
That's great.

365
00:22:18,801 --> 00:22:20,336
That's thoughtful of you.

366
00:22:21,037 --> 00:22:22,171
I forgive you.

367
00:22:22,238 --> 00:22:24,273
Oh, I wanted to go.

368
00:22:28,611 --> 00:22:32,948
Well, just before I lose my entire meal and
you turned the manpower here.

369
00:22:33,616 --> 00:22:35,751
Once you get up, entertain us with one of
your jokes.

370
00:22:35,785 --> 00:22:35,951
Hey.

371
00:22:41,424 --> 00:22:42,491
Twenty one, huh?

372
00:22:44,293 --> 00:22:46,595
Well, now it seems it was this traveling
sale.

373
00:22:48,964 --> 00:22:52,968
Well, now that's one of the reasons I never
lose faith in man's ability to solve his own

374
00:22:52,968 --> 00:22:56,939
problems. It's going to be a long time
before Eddie realizes that was more of a gift

375
00:22:56,939 --> 00:22:59,742
to us than it was to him anyway.

376
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:03,279
If his wife is watching, I'll be coming
straight home after the meeting and I think I

377
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:06,649
figured out what it was. I said at that
party last week that got you so upset and I'd

378
00:23:06,649 --> 00:23:08,184
like to take my third guest tonight.

379
00:23:09,251 --> 00:23:13,355
I'm wrong. I'm going to have to go with a
blanket apology covering the last 30 years,

380
00:23:13,355 --> 00:23:14,490
which I know you're getting real tired of
hearing.

381
00:23:15,758 --> 00:23:20,396
So until next time on behalf of myself and
Harold and the whole gang up here at Possum

382
00:23:20,396 --> 00:23:22,031
Lodge. Keep your stick on the ice.

383
00:23:25,234 --> 00:23:27,803
You guys ready with an indoor outdoor, the

384
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,838
Couch kind of a gift.

385
00:23:29,872 --> 00:23:34,443
I guess whatever I was trying to whack
carpet nails in the cell could.

386
00:23:37,112 --> 00:23:38,948
It was a long, long trip, boy.

387
00:23:39,048 --> 00:23:41,650
Forty five days after the curry beef, oh.

388
00:23:44,086 --> 00:23:49,024
With this traveling salesman is out in the
country, and he's tired, sleepy and he sees

389
00:23:49,024 --> 00:23:50,693
his farmhouse off in the distance.

390
00:23:52,127 --> 00:23:54,897
One of those lovely on this job kind of a
hip roof.
