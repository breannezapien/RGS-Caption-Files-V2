THAT ANYBODY WHO HAS
A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE,

ACCURATE INFORMATION
IS PROBABLY BORING.

WOMEN'S INTUITION
IS USUALLY RIGHT.

OUR WEATHER REPORT.

STUFF DIRECT FROM OLD

ENTERTAINING THAN
STARING AT A FOREST.

00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:10,196
WELL, THIS IS THE STORY
ABOUT LUCY DEPP

44
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:12,865
SHE HAD A HUSBAND
THAT SNORED

45
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:15,368
AND NOTHING WOULD STOP
HIM AND NOTHING WOULD HELP

46
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:18,004
AT LEAST NOTHING THAT
LUCY COULD AFFORD

00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,473
THEY SAY YOU SHOULD
WAKE A SNORER UP

48
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,176
SO THAT'S WHAT LUCY DID

49
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,745
THE GOOD NEWS IS IT
STOPPED HIS SNORING

50
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:29,182
BUT LUCY NOW
HAS 17 KIDS

51
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:32,351
OKAY.
YOU GOT A PROBLEM.

52
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:34,287
YOU GOT AN ANNIVERSARY
THAT YOU THINK IS
COMING UP

53
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:37,590
BUT IN FACT IT'S
NOT COMING UP,
IT HAS GONE BY.

YOU PULLED A COMPLETE
BLANK, TOTAL AMNEMIA.

AND NOW YOU GOT TO
BE DIGGING YOURSELF OUT,

BECAUSE, BROTHER,
YOU'RE IN THE
DEEP STUFF.

WHICH, YOU
KNOW, HAPPENS TO
BE MY SPECIALTY, EH?

59

OH, GEEZ, I FORGOT
ABOUT OUR ANNIVERSARY.

60
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,375
YOU COULD SAY
THAT, YOU KNOW.

61
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,677
AND YOU COULD JUST
LIE A LITTLE BIT

62
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,979
AND SAY, OH,
WELL, THAT DOESN'T
MATTER, YOU KNOW,

63
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,547
MAYBE SHE WOULD
FORGIVE YOU.

64
00:03:01,547 --> 00:03:03,983
SHE WON'T.
AND WHY SHOULD SHE?

WHAT YOU DO,

66
00:03:05,217 --> 00:03:06,786
YOU TELL HER YOU
POSTPONED THE

'TIL THE WEEKEND
BECAUSE THE SPECIAL GIFT

HER WON'T BE
DELIVERED 'TIL THEN.

NOW, IF YOU FORGET TO
GET HER A GIFT ON
THE WEEKEND,

71
00:03:16,495 --> 00:03:18,998
YOU'RE ON
YOUR OWN BUD.

72
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,667
OR PLAN B, PLAN B,
YOU WHIP OUT

TO LAST YEAR'S

TO CELEBRATE THE
ANNIVERSARY TWICE.

77
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:37,083
THAT MIGHT WORK.

78
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,617
OF COURSE IF IT
DOESN'T, YOU KNOW,

79
00:03:38,617 --> 00:03:44,090
YOU MIGHT NOT EVEN
BE CELEBRATING THE
ANNIVERSARY THE ONCE.

80
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,225
YOU KNOW, OLD MAN SEDGEWICK

ABOUT SOMETHING

81
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:48,761

TO PREDICT WEATHER
WITH HIS BODY

84
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:54,934
AND HE'S NOT
MAKING A THIN
DIME OFF OF IT.

85
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:58,270
IF HE WAS THAT
RONCO GUY, HE'D
PROBABLY MARKET IT

86
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,073
AS THE POMPEEL POCKET

87
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:04,944

REFUSES TO GET UP OFF
HIS ASSET AND ADVERTISE.

88
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:07,613

90
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,950
WE WANT TO KEEP THE

TO ADVERTISE, TOO.

93
00:04:15,754 --> 00:04:17,156
NOW, I SUPPOSE, WE
CAN TAKE OUT AN AD

94
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,958
IN SOMETHING LIKE

95

ON THE EXPOSED BODY
PARTS OF EXOTIC DANCERS,

WHICH IS WORLD FAMOUS
IN PARTS OF ALASKA.

106
00:04:47,853 --> 00:04:49,822

I EVEN PUT TEETH
ONTO THE FRONT BUMPER

111

114
00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:10,442

DRAW ATTENTION TO YOURSELF.

AND MAYBE POSSIBLY
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY

134
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,228
I TOOK MY EYES OFF
THE ROAD A LITTLE
BIT TOO LONG.

135
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:06,965
I THINK IT'S
JUST BUSTER'S

OH GEEZ, I STALLED HER.
OH MAN.

COME ON.
COME ON, BABY.

138
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,575
COME ON.
COME ON.

139
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,076
THERE WE GO.
THERE WE GO.

140
00:06:18,076 --> 00:06:19,545
AND JUST MERGE,
MERGE, MERGE.

141
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,813
EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.

142
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,047
THERE WE GO.

143
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:23,582
NOW THE DIRT --
THAT'S NOT A
GOOD THING,

144
00:06:23,582 --> 00:06:25,584
IT'S HARD TO --
ANYWAY, NOW I'M
IN THE MIDDLE LANE

145
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:28,754
SO I'M BEING EXPOSED TO
AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT
SET OF DRIVERS

146
00:06:28,754 --> 00:06:30,822
BUT MAYBE NOT SO
MUCH TO THE STANDS.

147
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:32,624
AND THERE I'M BACK
OUTSIDE, BACK OUTSIDE.

148
00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:34,092
THERE WE GO.
NICE MOVE.
NICE MOVE.

149
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:35,761
THAT CAR IS LOOKING
GOOD, ISN'T IT?

150
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:37,196
GLAD WE WASHED HER.

151
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:38,530
THERE'S THIS DARN
CURVE AGAIN.

152
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,699
OH BUSTER.
GOSH.

153
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:44,369
OH NO.
STALLED HER.

154
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:48,273
ANNOUNCER: RED GREEN'S,
CAR NUMBER 11,

155
00:06:48,273 --> 00:06:52,044
HE IS HEADED IN THE
WRONG DIRECTION.

156
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,445
RED GREEN: I THOUGHT
I WOULD GIVE THEM

157
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:54,980
A LITTLE DIFFERENT
ANGLE HERE

158
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,982
SO THEY GET TO SEE THE
SIGN FROM BOTH SIDES.

159
00:06:56,982 --> 00:06:59,251
I TELL YOU ONE THING,
THEY WON'T FORGET ME.

160
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:03,188
I DARE YOU GUYS TO HIT ME.
I WAS KIDDING.

161
00:07:03,188 --> 00:07:04,389
RED GREEN: STAY TUNED.

162
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:05,657
DALTON IS GOING TO
SELL YOU ONE

163
00:07:05,657 --> 00:07:06,959
OF HIS PRECIOUS
ANTIQUES,

164
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,662
AND, LOOK, IT'S SAP
TIME UP AT THE LODGE.

165
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:17,669
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
YOUNGER VIEWERS OUT
THERE ABOUT GUNS.

166
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:19,404
I HEAR WHERE KIDS
ARE CARRYING GUNS,

167
00:07:19,404 --> 00:07:22,641
TO HIGH SCHOOL,
TO JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL,
EVEN TO PUBLIC SCHOOL.

168
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:26,778
AND THESE KIDS ARE NOT
PART OF THE SCHOOL'S
BIATHLON TEAM.

169
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:29,081
SEEMS THAT "SHOW AND TELL"
HAS GIVEN WAY

170
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,883
TO SHOOT AND ASK
QUESTIONS LATER.

171
00:07:31,883 --> 00:07:33,752
NOW, I'LL ADMIT THAT
THERE'S A CERTAIN
AMOUNT OF HUNTING

172
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:35,087
THAT GOES ON UP
HERE AT THE LODGE,

173
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,688
BUT IT'S ALL LEGAL,
IT'S IN SEASON

174
00:07:36,688 --> 00:07:38,924
AND IT'S DONE WITH ALL
THE SAFETY RULES IN MIND.

175
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:40,559
AND, BESIDES, NOTHING
EVER GETS SHOT BECAUSE

176
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:43,328
THE ANIMALS HAVE THE
INTELLECTUAL EDGE.

177
00:07:43,328 --> 00:07:45,997
GUNS ARE FOR SPORT,
NOT FOR SCHOOL.

178
00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:47,933
I BLAME THE PARENTS.

179
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:49,634
I THINK YOU GOT TO
WATCH FOR THE SIGN

180
00:07:49,634 --> 00:07:51,903
WHEN A KID HAS SOME
BAD STUDY HABITS.

181
00:07:51,903 --> 00:07:53,505
FOR, EXAMPLE WHEN YOU
GOT A NINE YEAR OLD

182
00:07:53,505 --> 00:07:55,207
GOING TO SCHOOL WITH
A SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPON,

183
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:58,243
THERE'S A PRETTY GOOD
CHANCE HE DOESN'T HAVE
HIS HOMEWORK DONE.

184
00:07:58,243 --> 00:08:00,245
I THINK MAYBE THAT'S
TIME FOR DAD TO SIT DOWN,

185
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:03,915
HAVE A FATHER-SON
TALK AND GIVE HIM THE
GUIDANCE THAT HE NEEDS.

186
00:08:03,915 --> 00:08:07,385
MAYBE GIVE HIM A HUG
OR TELL HIM HOW MUCH
YOU CARE ABOUT HIM.

187
00:08:07,385 --> 00:08:11,189
START TO REBUILD THAT
RELATIONSHIP THAT YOU'VE
LET SLIP AWAY.

188
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:14,926
JUST MAKE SURE HE
KEEPS HIS HANDS OUT
WHERE YOU CAN SEE THEM.

189
00:08:17,662 --> 00:08:21,366
WE ARE MOMENTS AWAY
FROM THE BIGGEST RIP
SNORTING STORM

190
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:24,436
TO HIT THIS AREA SINCE
THE ONE THAT WASHED
AWAY POSSUM HILL.

191
00:08:24,436 --> 00:08:26,771
EVERYTHING AROUND
THE LODGE OF VALUE
HAS BEEN NAILED DOWN,

192
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:29,541
TIED DOWN,
BOLTED DOWN
OR BURIED.

193
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,376
OLD MAN SEDGEWICK'S
HIPS ARE SEIZED UP SO BAD

194
00:08:31,376 --> 00:08:33,845
HE HAD TO GET
SOMEBODY ELSE TO
DO HIS PAPER ROUTE.

195
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:35,847
UNCLE RED,
I'VE SCANNED THE
CLEAR BLUE HORIZON,

196
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:37,549
THERE'S NOT A
CLOUD IN THE SKY.

197
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:39,651
THE BEST WEATHER COMPUTERS
AND SATELLITE PHOTOS

198
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:42,120
SAY THERE IS GOING
TO BE NO STORM.

199
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,022
EVEN THE COLOUR RADAR
ON THE WEATHER CHANNEL

200
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:45,957
SAYS THERE'S NO
PRECIPITATION
IN THE AREA,

201
00:08:45,957 --> 00:08:49,661
AND YOU KNOW
TELEVISION DOESN'T LIE.
YEAH, RIGHT.

202
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:51,329
WELL, JUNIOR DOESN'T
AGREE WITH YOU, HAROLD.

203
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:52,631
HE TOOK ALL THE
SHINGLES OFF HIS ROOF

204
00:08:52,631 --> 00:08:53,999
AND PUT THEM DOWN
IN THE BASEMENT

205
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:56,201
SO HE KNOWS WHERE
TO FIND THEM WHEN
THE STORM IS OVER.

206
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:57,936
MOOSE THOMPSON HAS
BOARDED UP HIS WINDOWS

207
00:08:57,936 --> 00:09:00,739
AND FLINTY MCCLINTOCK
EVEN TOOK DOWN HIS
CHRISTMAS LIGHTS.

208
00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:02,207
YOU SEE THE PANIC
YOU'RE CAUSING?

209
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,576
THERE IS GOING
TO BE NO STORM.

210
00:09:04,576 --> 00:09:06,177
HAROLD, I'M ONLY
GOING TO SAY
THIS ONCE,

211
00:09:06,177 --> 00:09:08,179
IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR
CHICKENS AS MUCH AS
YOU SAY YOU DO,

212
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:09,881
I THINK YOU BETTER
GET OUT THERE AND
TIE UP THAT COOP

213
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:11,416
AND BATTEN DOWN
THE HATCHES.

214
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,451
WHY?
WHY?

215
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:15,253
BECAUSE SOME OLD
MAN IN THE WOODS

216
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:19,758
WITH A CALCIUM DEFICIENCY
IN HIS HIP JOINTS --

217
00:09:19,758 --> 00:09:22,327
WHAT'S THAT?
IT WASN'T
ME, HAROLD.

218
00:09:22,327 --> 00:09:24,496
MAYBE IT
WAS THE STORM.

219
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:27,298
MY CHICKENS.
MY CHICKENS!

220
00:09:27,298 --> 00:09:31,669
FORGET IT, HAROLD,
THEY'RE HALFWAY
TO OZ BY NOW.

221
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:37,675
YOU KNOW TO MOST
PEOPLE MOTHER NATURE
IS JUST A QUAINT FAIRYTALE.

222
00:09:37,675 --> 00:09:43,815
BUT TO NATIVE PEOPLE,
EARTH MOTHER IS A
VERY REAL SPIRIT.

223
00:09:43,815 --> 00:09:47,485
TO ME SHE'S A BIG
SUMAC NAMED GWENDOLYN.

224
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:49,721
WE'RE OUT HERE BY
THE MAIN HIGHWAY

225
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:51,189
AT HUMPHREY'S
EVERYTHING STORE

226
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:53,758
TO KIND OF ASSESS
THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE
DONE BY THE STORM.

227
00:09:53,758 --> 00:09:56,327
AND IT LOOKS TO ME
LIKE THERE'S BEEN
PLENTY HERE.

228
00:09:56,327 --> 00:09:58,363
THAT CAN'T BE GOOD NEWS
FOR OUR RESIDENT CURIO

229
00:09:58,363 --> 00:10:00,298
AND ANTIQUE COLLECTOR,
DALTON HUMPHRIES.

230
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:03,134
DALTON, EXACTLY HOW
MUCH DAMAGE DID YOU
SUSTAIN OUT HERE?

231
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:04,269
DAMAGE?
WOAH.

232
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:05,904
NOT ENOUGH FOR ME
I'LL TELL YOU.

233
00:10:05,904 --> 00:10:09,407
JUST WISH I HAD A
CHANCE TO GET MORE
FURNITURE OUT IN THE RAIN.

234
00:10:09,407 --> 00:10:12,944
YOU LOST ME
THERE, DALTON.

235
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:15,547
YOU KNOW, ANY ANTIQUE
DEALER WORTH HIS SALT

236
00:10:15,547 --> 00:10:17,382
KNOWS HOW TO USE
WEATHER TO HIS
ADVANTAGE.

237
00:10:17,382 --> 00:10:19,784
NOW, TAKE YOUR ACID
RAIN, YOUR TOXIC RAIN,

238
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:22,253
NOTHING DISCOLOURS
A STAIN MORE EVENLY

239
00:10:22,253 --> 00:10:24,389
OR AGES MORE
BEAUTIFULLY.

240
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:27,358
YOU CAN'T GET TEXTURE
LIKE THIS OUT OF
A CAN.

241
00:10:27,358 --> 00:10:28,560
OH, SO RAIN IS GOOD.

242
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,062
OH, RAIN IS GOOD, YEAH.
SNOW IS BETTER.
WOW.

243
00:10:31,062 --> 00:10:33,331
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE
THE SENSE OF HISTORY

244
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:37,402
YOU GET WITH FREEZING
TEMPERATURES AND THEN
A SLOW THAW.

245
00:10:37,402 --> 00:10:39,537
LOOK AT THIS THING.
THIS IS MONEY
IN THE BANK.

246
00:10:39,537 --> 00:10:42,907
ALL THIS LATENT PAINT
JUST SCREAMS OLD
TO PEOPLE.

247
00:10:42,907 --> 00:10:45,576
YOU CAN'T FAKE THIS
KIND OF STUFF WITH
A HEAT GUN.

248
00:10:45,576 --> 00:10:47,211
I'VE TRIED.

249
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:49,647
NO, NO, SNOW, THAT'S
WHAT GIVES YOU THE
PERFECT FLAKE JOB.

250
00:10:49,647 --> 00:10:53,051
SO THIS IS WHY THE
ANTIQUE DEALERS LEAVE
ALL THEIR STUFF OUTSIDE.

251
00:10:53,051 --> 00:10:56,087
TRADE SECRET.

252
00:10:56,087 --> 00:10:57,855
YEAH, PRECIPITATION,
THAT'S THE KEY, HUH?

253
00:10:57,855 --> 00:10:59,324
YEAH,
PRECIPITATION.

254
00:10:59,324 --> 00:11:00,858
AND, YOU KNOW,
SUN IS GOOD, TOO.

255
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:02,460
YOU KNOW THIS
THINNING OZONE LAYER

256
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,495
HAS BEEN A REAL BOOM TO
THE ANTIQUE INDUSTRY.

257
00:11:04,495 --> 00:11:06,130
OH SURE.
HERE.
LOOK.

258
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,934
LOOK AT THIS.
LOOK.

259
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:14,338
HOW OLD WOULD YOU
SAY THIS IS?
MID-40S.

260
00:11:14,338 --> 00:11:15,740
YEAH?

261
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,408
BOUGHT IT BRAND NEW
TWO YEARS AGO,

262
00:11:17,408 --> 00:11:19,310
LEFT IT ON THE ROOF
OF THE OLD TOOL SHED.

263
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,413
YEAH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
$15 TURNED TO 200.

264
00:11:22,413 --> 00:11:24,482
WELL, THANK YOU,
DALTON.

265
00:11:24,482 --> 00:11:27,118
IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO
KNOW THIS STUFF,
ISN'T IT FOLKS?

266
00:11:27,118 --> 00:11:29,120
OH BOY, LOOKS LIKE
IT'S TURNING NICE.

267
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,955
MAYBE WE'LL GET
A HEAT WAVE, HUH?

268
00:11:30,955 --> 00:11:35,226
MAKE THOSE CHAIRS OVER
THERE JUST TURN IN
LIKE PRETZELS.

269
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:46,137
HOW COME SOME GUYS ARE
SO TERRITORIAL ABOUT
THEIR CARS, UNCLE RED?

270
00:11:46,137 --> 00:11:49,674
TERRITORIAL, HAROLD?
THESE ARE GUYS, NOT
TIMBERWOLVES.

271
00:11:49,674 --> 00:11:53,044
THEY DON'T GO AROUND
MARKING THEIR CARS
WITH THEIR SCENT.

272
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:56,447
WELL, AT THE LAST
TAILGATE PARTY
THEY DID.

273
00:11:56,447 --> 00:11:58,249
OKAY, LIKE JUNIOR
SINGLETON, RIGHT?

274
00:11:58,249 --> 00:12:00,518
EVERY MORNING HE'S
OUT THERE AND HE'S
WASHING HIS CAR

275
00:12:00,518 --> 00:12:02,320
AND AT LUNCH HE'S OUT
THERE WAXING IT

276
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,255
AND RIGHT AFTER SUPPER
HE'S OUT THERE
BUFFING IT.

277
00:12:04,255 --> 00:12:06,090
HE'S RUBBING THAT
THING FROM TOP
TO BOTTOM

278
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,992
FIVE TIMES A DAY.

279
00:12:07,992 --> 00:12:10,061
HE'S JUST PROTECTING
HIS INVESTMENT,
HAROLD.

280
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:11,729
HE'S TRYING TO KEEP
THE VALUE UP

281
00:12:11,729 --> 00:12:14,165
ON WHAT MANY PEOPLE
CONSIDER TO BE A
CLASSIC EXAMPLE

282
00:12:14,165 --> 00:12:17,735
OF AUTOMOTIVE
STYLING AND
ENGINEERING.

283
00:12:17,735 --> 00:12:21,072
AN '86 OMNI?

284
00:12:21,072 --> 00:12:22,540
WELL, I DON'T
KNOW, HAROLD.

285
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,242
I MEAN, THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT A CAR, THAT'S ALL,

286
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:26,210
THE STYLE,
THE POWER,
SOMETHING.

287
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,679
A GIRL IN MY CLASS
TOLD ME THAT A
MAN'S VEHICLE

288
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:32,149
IS JUST A SUBSTITUTE
FOR HIS YOU KNOW WHAT.

289
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:33,584
THAT'S A GOOD
THING, HAROLD,

290
00:12:33,584 --> 00:12:34,952
'CAUSE LIGHTS, MIRRORS
AND MUD FLAPS

291
00:12:34,952 --> 00:12:37,955
LOOK A LOT BETTER
ON A CAR, BELIEVE ME.

292
00:12:39,957 --> 00:12:42,326
WOODEN TOBOGGAN,
BY ME.

293
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:45,529
WHEN I GO TOBOGGANING,
I RIDE ON ONE
THAT'S WOOD.

294
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:49,467
IT'S FASTER
THAN ALUMINUM AND
I THINK FAST IS GOOD.

295
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:51,469
AND WOOD WILL BEND
IF YOU HIT ROCKS,

296
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:54,171
NOT LIKE SLEDS
MADE OF METAL.

297
00:12:54,171 --> 00:12:56,207
AND WOOD MAKES
A GOOD STRETCHER

298
00:12:56,207 --> 00:12:59,176
FOR THE RIDE
TO THE HOSPITAL.

299
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:06,183
RED GREEN:
TIME FOR ADVENTURES WITH BILL.

300
00:13:06,183 --> 00:13:07,852
BILL SAID HE'S GOING
TO STOP ON THE WAY

301
00:13:07,852 --> 00:13:09,120
AND GET SOME BREAKFAST.

302
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,123
HE PICKED UP SOME
WAFFLES, WHICH --

303
00:13:12,123 --> 00:13:14,725
I USUALLY LIKE WAFFLES
BUT THESE ONES,
I DON'T KNOW,

304
00:13:14,725 --> 00:13:17,528
THEY WERE PRETTY
DRIED OUT.

305
00:13:17,528 --> 00:13:18,696
YEAH.
YEAH.

306
00:13:18,696 --> 00:13:20,264
VERY DRIED
OUT I'D SAY.

307
00:13:20,264 --> 00:13:22,433
BUT ANYWAY THE
IDEA IS -- OH,
OH, OH, OH, OH, OH.

308
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:24,769
THE IDEA IS BILL IS
GOING TO LOOK AND
FIND SOME --

309
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:26,137
NOT IN THERE BILL.

310
00:13:26,137 --> 00:13:28,105
BILL IS GOING TO LOOK
AND FIND SOME SYRUP
TO PUT ON.

311
00:13:28,105 --> 00:13:31,041
HE'S GOT THIS STICK
APPARENTLY HE USES
TO TAP ON THE TREE.

312
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,477
WELL, YOU KNOW, ONE
LESS ISN'T GOING
TO HURT.

313
00:13:33,477 --> 00:13:35,012
VERY DEFINITELY
DRIED OUT.

314
00:13:35,012 --> 00:13:38,382
SO HE TAPS ON
THE TREE AND THAT
ONE SOUNDS KIND OF HOLLOW.

315
00:13:38,382 --> 00:13:39,917
NO.
NO.

316
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:41,752
NOW, THIS IS
INTERESTING,

317
00:13:41,752 --> 00:13:44,655
THE STUMP
IS COMPLETELY
COVERED WITH THE SYRUP.

318
00:13:44,655 --> 00:13:47,758
I GUESS --
OH, OH, OH, OH, OH,

319
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:50,261
OH, THAT STUFF
IS VERY, VERY STICKY.

320
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:52,463
I GUESS THE STUFF
HAD ALL GONE DOWN
INTO THE STUMP.

321
00:13:52,463 --> 00:13:54,064
WHAT'S THAT?
WHAT'S THAT?

322
00:13:54,064 --> 00:13:56,834
OH, OH, OH,
FOR GOSH SAKE,

323
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:58,569
A LITTLE SQUIRREL
ALL STUCK TO THE SYRUP.

324
00:13:58,569 --> 00:14:00,604
BILL HELP HIM OUT THERE.
GET HIM OFF THAT TREE.

325
00:14:00,604 --> 00:14:01,739
THERE HE GOES.
THERE HE GOES.

326
00:14:01,739 --> 00:14:03,274
OH, HE'S FINE.
HE'S FINE.
HE'S FINE.

327
00:14:03,274 --> 00:14:06,210
OH, ISN'T THAT
A CUTE LITTLE GUY.

328
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,846
WELL, THERE GOES
YOUR STICK, BILL.

329
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:11,115
THAT DOESN'T MATTER,
WE KNOW THERE'S
SYRUP IN THAT THING.

330
00:14:11,115 --> 00:14:13,450
SO WE JUST TAKE A
PIPE WITH A VALVE
ON THE END.

331
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,920
BILL DRIVES
IT IN THERE.

332
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,689
HE'LL BE BACK BUT HE
WON'T BE SWINGING
THE HAMMER

333
00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:20,658
WITH ME HOLDING HER,
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

334
00:14:20,658 --> 00:14:22,293
SO I DRIVE HER IN,
HE HANGS THE BUCKET ON,

335
00:14:22,293 --> 00:14:27,031
YOU JUST OPEN THE
VALVE AND WATCH THE
SYRUP JUST FLOW, FLOW.

336
00:14:27,031 --> 00:14:29,133
OH MY GOSH.

337
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:31,335
WHAT DO WE DO NOW BILL?

338
00:14:31,335 --> 00:14:33,504
WELL, BILL IS NEVER
SHORT OF AN IDEA,

339
00:14:33,504 --> 00:14:34,972
NOT A GOOD IDEA,
BUT AN IDEA.

340
00:14:34,972 --> 00:14:37,308
HE'S GOT THE TENSOR
BANDAGE THERE FOR
ALL HIS INJURIES

341
00:14:37,308 --> 00:14:39,209
AND HE STARTS UNWINDING
THAT OFF HIS LEG

342
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:42,179
AND I BELIEVE THAT
GOES RIGHT UP TO
HIS ARMPITS.

343
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:44,014
I'M NOT GOING TO HELP
HIM, YOU NOTICE THAT.

344
00:14:44,014 --> 00:14:46,016
AND HE STARTS WINDING
THAT AROUND THE TREE
REAL TIGHT

345
00:14:46,016 --> 00:14:48,318
SO THERE'S
TENSION ON THERE.

346
00:14:48,318 --> 00:14:51,021
I'M AWFUL GLAD PEOPLE
DON'T WALK ALONG AS
WE'RE DOING THIS,

347
00:14:51,021 --> 00:14:54,224
THEY MIGHT HAVE
SOME EMBARRASSING
LESSONS FOR US.

348
00:14:54,224 --> 00:14:55,759
NOW HE OPENS UP --
OH MY GOSH.

349
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:57,094
TOO MUCH PRESSURE.
TOO MUCH PRESSURE.

350
00:14:57,094 --> 00:14:58,529
TURN IT DOWN, BILL.
TURN IT DOWN.

351
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:00,230
GET THE WAFFLES.
GET THE WAFFLES.
GET THE WAFFLES.

352
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,399
GET THE WAFFLES.
NO, BILL, GET THE WAFFLES.

353
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,835
BILL FORGET YOUR JACKET,
GET THE WAFFLES.

354
00:15:04,835 --> 00:15:06,170
MIGHT AS WELL GET
THE SYRUP ON THERE.

355
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,338
THERE YOU GO.
THERE YOU GO.
THERE YOU GO.

356
00:15:08,338 --> 00:15:10,707
WOW JUST IN THE
NICK OF TIME, TOO.

357
00:15:10,707 --> 00:15:13,010
THAT PRETTY WELL
DRAINED HER DRY,
I GUESS.

358
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,913
AND THERE'S ALL
THE WAFFLES ALL
DONE AND EVERYTHING.

359
00:15:15,913 --> 00:15:17,314
NO THANKS, BILL.

360
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:19,249
I'LL FEED MINE
TO THE ANIMALS.

361
00:15:20,284 --> 00:15:21,885
RED GREEN: STAY TUNED
FOR SPECIAL GUEST

362
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:24,254
GRAHAM GREENE IN HIS
MOST EXPLOSIVE ROLE.

363
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:26,890
WINSTON ROTHCHILD HERE
FOR ROTHCHILD'S

364
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,827
SEWAGE AND SEPTIC

365
00:15:29,827 --> 00:15:33,430
WHERE OUR MOTTO IS
WASTE NOT PUMP NOT,

366
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:37,634
1-800-555-SUCK.

367
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:41,004
OKAY, I GOT A MEMO
HERE FROM STINKY PETERSON.

368
00:15:41,004 --> 00:15:42,773
IT SAYS: TO ALL MEMBERS
OF POSSUM LODGE,

369
00:15:42,773 --> 00:15:45,776
PLEASE STOP CALLING
ME STINKY, I'M
SICK OF IT.

370
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:49,046
OH, GOOD FOR YOU STINKY --
MR. PETERSON, SORRY.

371
00:15:49,046 --> 00:15:54,718
MY NEW NICKNAME
IS AERO MATIC.

372
00:15:56,553 --> 00:16:00,791
[ APPLAUSE ]

373
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:03,060
WELL, NOW, THAT
WAS A HUMDINGER.

374
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,329
I LOVE THE WAY THE
STORM CLEARS THE AIR,

375
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:08,298
NO MORE PAINT FUMES
OR DIESEL FUMES.

376
00:16:08,298 --> 00:16:12,936
OH, HAROLD, I FORGOT
TO ASK, HOW WERE
YOUR CHICKENS?

377
00:16:12,936 --> 00:16:17,174
YOU KNOW AS WELL
AS I DO THEY
FLEW THE COOP.

378
00:16:17,174 --> 00:16:19,876
LUCKILY THE
COOP FLEW, TOO.

379
00:16:19,876 --> 00:16:22,879
I FOUND IT NINE
MILES DOWN THE
HIGHWAY.

380
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:25,248
WHO SAYS CHICKENS
CAN'T FLY, EH HAROLD?

381
00:16:25,248 --> 00:16:28,185
ALL THEIR LITTLE
FEATHERS ARE BLOWN
OFF TOO.

382
00:16:28,185 --> 00:16:31,388
SOMERSAULTED
INTO TOWN.

383
00:16:31,388 --> 00:16:34,057
NOW, YOU WON'T HAVE
TO SCRAMBLE THEIR EGGS.

384
00:16:34,057 --> 00:16:36,026
MY ROAD ISLAND RED,
ROAD ISLAND RED

385
00:16:36,026 --> 00:16:37,961
CAUGHT UNDER A TREE...

386
00:16:37,961 --> 00:16:41,331
TINY CHICKEN
MCNUGGETS.

387
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:43,200
YEAH, I HEARD,
HAROLD.

388
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,801
THAT'S TOO BAD,
YOU KNOW.

389
00:16:44,801 --> 00:16:46,336
AND THE TALL PINE
TREE WENT DOWN,

390
00:16:46,336 --> 00:16:48,638
THE BIG ONE THAT'S BEEN
IN TOWN FOR SO DARN
LONG THERE.

391
00:16:48,638 --> 00:16:52,542
IT FELL OVER LIKE
A RELATIVE AT
AN OPEN BAR.

392
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:55,612
THAT'S TERRIBLE.
THAT TREE IS A PART
OF OUR HERITAGE.

393
00:16:55,612 --> 00:16:58,815
WELL RIGHT NOW THAT PINE
TREE HAS THE HIGHWAY
COMPLETELY CLOSED.

394
00:16:58,815 --> 00:17:01,785
LIFE IN POSSUM LAKE
HAS GROUND TO A HALT.

395
00:17:01,785 --> 00:17:04,654
HOW CAN YOU TELL
THE DIFFERENCE?

396
00:17:04,654 --> 00:17:07,491
WELL, HAROLD, IT'S
GIVEN US THE OPPORTUNITY
TO HAVE A CHAINSAW PARTY.

397
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:10,727
SIX HOURS AND 130
DECIBELS FROM NOW,

398
00:17:10,727 --> 00:17:12,162
THE HIGHWAY WILL BE OPEN

399
00:17:12,162 --> 00:17:14,564
AND EVERYBODY WILL HAVE
ENOUGH FIREWOOD TO
LAST THE WINTER.

400
00:17:14,564 --> 00:17:15,866
YOU COMING HAROLD?

401
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:17,734
NO, I'M JUST GOING
TO GO LOOK FOR MY
LAST CHICKEN.

402
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:19,569
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S
PROBABLY UNDER THE
PINE TREE

403
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:22,005
LIKE IN THAT JOKE,
WHY DID THE PINE
TREE CROSS THE ROAD?

404
00:17:22,005 --> 00:17:27,077
TO GET TO THE
OTHER CHICKEN.

405
00:17:28,512 --> 00:17:30,814
OKAY, HERE'S ONE NOW
FROM MOOSE THOMPSON.

406
00:17:30,814 --> 00:17:33,350
MOOSE WRITES: I'M TIRED
OF MY NICKNAME,

407
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,719
IT MAKES ME SOUND BIG
AND DUMB AND STUPID,

408
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:38,154
SO EVERYONE STOP CALLING
ME MOOSE THOMPSON.

409
00:17:38,154 --> 00:17:41,525
MY NEW NICKNAME IS
MOOSE JOHNSON.

410
00:17:43,827 --> 00:17:46,196
WE'RE UP HERE
WITH OUR FRIEND,
RANGER GORD.

411
00:17:46,196 --> 00:17:48,999
HI RED.
HI EVERYONE.

412
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:51,635
I MISS YOU.
ALL RIGHT, GORD.

413
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:52,802
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING TODAY?

414
00:17:52,802 --> 00:17:54,237
MAKING PARTY
INVITATIONS, RED,

415
00:17:54,237 --> 00:17:56,039
BECAUSE I REALIZE THAT
PEOPLE AREN'T
SHOWING UP

416
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,774
FOR MY GET-TOGETHERS
HERE AT THE FIRE TOWER

417
00:17:57,774 --> 00:18:01,278
BECAUSE OF THE BLAND,
ORDINARY INVITATIONS
I'M SENDING OUT.

418
00:18:01,278 --> 00:18:04,681
WELL, IT MAY NOT BE
THAT BIG OF A FACTOR.

419
00:18:05,382 --> 00:18:06,883
SURE IT IS.
SURE IT IS.

420
00:18:06,883 --> 00:18:08,485
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
BECAUSE WHO
DOESN'T LIKE

421
00:18:08,485 --> 00:18:12,522
FIMO PARTIES
OR SLEEPOVERS, HUH?

422
00:18:12,522 --> 00:18:14,758
SO I THOUGHT
THAT AFTER THE
CHAINSAW PARTY,

423
00:18:14,758 --> 00:18:16,126
WE COULD ALL
COME UP HERE

424
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:17,761
AND I COULD BUILD
A BIG BONFIRE

425
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:20,530
AND TELL A STORY
ABOUT THE HISTORY
OF POSSUM PINE.

426
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,666
BOY, THEY'LL BE
SCALPING TICKETS FOR
THAT ONE, WON'T THEY?

427
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:26,136
OH YEAH.
AND TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS INVITATION.

428
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:28,505
IS THAT
GROOVY OR WHAT?

429
00:18:28,505 --> 00:18:30,340
THERE'S NOTHING
WRITTEN ON THIS, GORD.

430
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,875
HA, HA,
HA, GOTCHA.

431
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,643
SEE, THIS IS
GOOD CAMP FUN.

432
00:18:33,643 --> 00:18:35,378
EVEN THE KIDS CAN
GET IN ON THIS GAG.

433
00:18:35,378 --> 00:18:37,180
IT'S WRITTEN IN
INVISIBLE INK.

434
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,982
AND ALL YOU NEED
IS SOME LEMON JUICE

435
00:18:38,982 --> 00:18:41,818
AND A MATCHSTICK

OUT YOUR INVITATION.

OH FOR GOSH SAKES.
SEE?

438
00:18:45,955 --> 00:18:48,224
THIS IS A FAR MORE
INTERESTING INVITATION.

439
00:18:48,224 --> 00:18:49,526
IT'S ENVIRONMENTALLY
FRIENDLY

440
00:18:49,526 --> 00:18:51,361
AND IT HELPS PEOPLE
GET INTO THE SPIRIT
OF THE PARTY

441
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:52,829
BEFORE THEY
EVEN GET THERE.

442
00:18:52,829 --> 00:18:56,132
IT'S TRUE.
AND IT WON'T STOP WITH
INVISIBLE INVITATIONS.

443
00:18:56,132 --> 00:18:58,902

YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
INVISIBLE GUESTS, TOO.

444
00:18:58,902 --> 00:19:03,006

THEY CAN MEET ALL MY
OTHER INVISIBLE FRIENDS.

AND FINALLY THERE'S
ONE FROM MY UNCLE RED.

446

I'M TIRED OF BEING
CALLED RED GREEN.

WANT TO BE CALLED AN
UNPRONOUNCEABLE SYMBOL

IS FROM BUTT, MONTANA.

454
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:34,337
THAT'S PRONOUNCED
BYOOT, HAROLD.

455
00:19:34,337 --> 00:19:38,074

YEAH.

456
00:19:43,813 --> 00:19:49,552
THEY MOVED, NOW THEY'RE
LIVING IN BUTTE, MONTANA.

457
00:19:49,552 --> 00:19:52,288
DEAR EXPERTS, ONE OF
THE CASEMENT-STYLE
WINDOWS

458
00:19:52,288 --> 00:19:54,090
IN OUR DINING
ROOM IS STUCK SHUT.

459
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,726
WHAT'S THE BEST WAY
TO GET IT SLIDING
AGAIN?

460
00:19:56,726 --> 00:19:58,595
WELL, YOU'VE JUST
PROBABLY PAINTED
HER SHUT THERE.

461
00:19:58,595 --> 00:20:00,964
YOU GOT TO CUT THAT
THROUGH WITH A RAZOR
BLADE OR A SHARP KNIFE.

462
00:20:00,964 --> 00:20:03,733
THAT'S PRETTY
LABOUR INTENSIVE, RED.

463
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:06,235
MAYBE THE WINDOW
IS STUCK BECAUSE
THE HOUSE IS SETTLING.

464
00:20:06,235 --> 00:20:09,472
YOU SEE, WHEN A
HOUSE GETS TO BE
SAY 40 YEARS OLD,

465
00:20:09,472 --> 00:20:12,141
IT SETTLES AND
SAGS AND BUCKLES.

466
00:20:12,141 --> 00:20:14,110
I'VE BEEN THERE.

467
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:17,413
YOU'RE STILL THERE.

468
00:20:17,413 --> 00:20:22,151
WELL, IN THAT CASE YOU
TAKE APART A COUPLE OF
22 SHELLS, YOU SEE,

469
00:20:22,151 --> 00:20:25,121
AND YOU POUR THE POWDER
INTO THE CORNER OF
THE FRAME

470
00:20:25,121 --> 00:20:29,125
AND SWOOM YOU CAN POP THAT
WINDOW OUT OF THERE IN
NO TIME FLAT.

471
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,960
THAT SOUNDS
PRETTY DANGEROUS.

472
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,529
HUH?
DANGEROUS.
IT SOUNDS DANGEROUS.

473
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:36,232
OH NO, NO, HAROLD
IT'S NOT SO DANGEROUS.

IS ONE OF THOSE EXPRESSIONS

LIKE AH... LIKE NERVE GAS.

476
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,309
SO WOULD YOU
BLOW OUT THE
ONE WINDOW, EDGAR,

477
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:48,044
OR ALL THE
WINDOWS?

478
00:20:48,044 --> 00:20:50,213
WELL, IF YOU'RE
GOING TO TAKE OUT
MORE THAN ONE,

479
00:20:50,213 --> 00:20:54,383
YOU'RE FURTHER AHEAD
JUST TO TAKE OUT
THE WHOLE HOUSE.

WAY AROUND THE PERIMETER,

A DOUBLE RIGHT IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE
CELLAR FLOOR

482
00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:01,224
AND YOU CAN
MAKE THAT THREE
BEDROOM BUNGALOW

483
00:21:01,224 --> 00:21:03,826
GET UP AND
DO A JIG.

484
00:21:03,826 --> 00:21:07,563
BUT WOULDN'T OUR
VIEWER HAVE TO REBUILD
HIS WHOLE HOUSE THOUGH?

SO?

CHARGES PROPERLY,

UP YOUR HOUSE,

THERE AND OLD MAN
SEDGEWICK YELLS OUT,

THINK ABOUT HAVING
A HIP REPLACEMENT.

WELL, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT HE'S DOING.

NEED A DONOR

WENT SKIING, BROKE
BOTH HIS LEGS.
