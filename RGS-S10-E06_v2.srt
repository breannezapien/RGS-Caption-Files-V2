OR WHAT COLOUR IT IS.

156
00:07:37,856 --> 00:07:40,158
HECK, EVEN IF IT DOESN'T WORK,
MEN WILL BUY IT.

157
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:41,727
TAKE A LOOK IN YOUR DRIVEWAY.

158
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:45,664
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL
I GO TO MY CUTTING STATION.

159
00:07:45,697 --> 00:07:49,534
I'M GONNA CUT THIS TO ROUGHLY
THE LENGTH THAT I WANT.

160
00:07:52,337 --> 00:07:56,675
ALL RIGHT, NOW WHAT WE DO
IS WE TAKE HER DOWN TO
OUR LATHE AREA THERE.

161
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,910
WE'RE GONNA ROUND OFF THE
CORNERS A BIT.

162
00:07:58,944 --> 00:08:03,215
NOW, I'VE ALREADY MOUNTED
A PIECE TO KIND OF SPEED
UP THIS DEMONSTRATION.

163
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:11,590
OKAY, ONCE I GET
THE LATHING DONE,

164
00:08:11,656 --> 00:08:13,124
I'VE GOT MY BASIC DUCK CALL.

165
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:16,061
BUT YOU KNOW, THIS IS
A LITTLE ROUGH FOR TODAY'S
DISCERNING CUSTOMER,

166
00:08:16,094 --> 00:08:18,597
SO NOW I'VE GOT TO GO
TO MY SANDING STATION.

167
00:08:18,663 --> 00:08:21,132
IT'S JUST REALLY A PIECE
OF FINE GRAIN SANDPAPER

168
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,135
MOUNTED ONTO A RECORD
ALBUM AS A BACKING.

169
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:26,137
ACTUALLY, I USED
NAT KING COLE ON THAT

170
00:08:26,204 --> 00:08:28,340
BECAUSE HE'S EXTRA SMOOTH.

171
00:08:28,406 --> 00:08:30,308
AND THEN JUST DO
YOUR LITTLE SANDING.

172
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:36,214
PERFECT.

173
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:38,250
NOW TO TURN IT
INTO A REAL DUCK CALL,

174
00:08:38,283 --> 00:08:40,385
I'VE GOT TO DRILL A HOLE
INTO THE DARN THING,

175
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:43,421
AND FOR THAT I'M GONNA USE
MY DRILLING STATION HERE.

176
00:08:43,488 --> 00:08:46,625
JUST SLOWLY --
YOU KNOW, YOU MAY WANT TO
WEAR SAFETY GOGGLES ON THIS,

177
00:08:46,691 --> 00:08:49,027
MAYBE EVEN SOME
CAST IRON GLOVES.

178
00:08:52,797 --> 00:08:54,265
AND IT'S JUST THAT EASY.

179
00:08:54,332 --> 00:08:56,835
SO YOU ENTREPRENEURS REMEMBER
IF THE WOMEN DON'T FIND
YOU HANDSOME,

180
00:08:56,901 --> 00:08:59,504
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

181
00:08:59,571 --> 00:09:03,675
[ HONKING NOISE ]

182
00:09:03,742 --> 00:09:08,346
I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT
99% OF NEW BUSINESSES FAIL
IN THEIR FIRST YEAR.

183
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:10,615
[ HONKING NOISE ]

184
00:09:13,618 --> 00:09:16,254
[ GEESE HONKING ]

185
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:33,972
[ APPLAUSE ]

186
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,575
YOU KNOW SOMETHING HAPPENS
TO GUYS' MAJOR SENSES

187
00:09:37,642 --> 00:09:39,778
WHEN THEY APPROACH
MIDDLE AGE?

188
00:09:39,844 --> 00:09:41,579
THEY LOSE 'EM.

189
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:44,482
BUT THEY LOSE 'EM
IN KIND OF AN ODD WAY.

190
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:47,318
THE OTHER DAY, BERNICE
WAS TALKING STRAIGHT
TO MY FACE THERE,

191
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:49,788
AND ALL I COULD HEAR WAS THE
RADIO IN THE NEXT ROOM

192
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:53,057
BECAUSE IT WAS RUNNING
THAT AD FOR THE BOAT SHOW.

193
00:09:53,124 --> 00:09:56,694
SHE WAS PROBABLY GIVING ME THE
DETAILS OF SOME IMPORTANT PLAN,

194
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:58,663
BUT THAT'S THE KIND
OF INFORMATION

195
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,365
THAT'S BETTER IN THE HANDS
OF SOMEBODY COMPETENT,

196
00:10:00,398 --> 00:10:03,101
SOMEBODY WHO HAS ALL
THEIR FACULTIES.

197
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:06,437
I'M LOSING MINE LIKE POCKET
CHANGE IN A LAZ-E-BOY.

198
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:11,476
BUT, LIKE I SAY,
YOU LOSE 'EM KINDA WEIRD;

199
00:10:11,543 --> 00:10:14,012
LIKE, MY EYES AREN'T GOOD
ENOUGH TO READ THE
STREET SIGNS,

200
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:19,017
BUT I CAN TELL IF THE BEER STORE
IS OPEN SIX BLOCKS AWAY.

201
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:22,954
I CAN'T WATCH TWO KIDS FOR HALF
AN HOUR WITHOUT A DISASTER,

202
00:10:23,021 --> 00:10:27,058
BUT I CAN WATCH FOUR BALL
GAMES AND AN INDY RACE
SIMULTANEOUSLY.

203
00:10:28,092 --> 00:10:29,928
SO, GUYS, LOOK,
DON'T FIGHT IT.

204
00:10:29,961 --> 00:10:32,063
IT'S NATURAL.

205
00:10:32,096 --> 00:10:33,565
JUST KIND OF
KEEP A LOW PROFILE.

206
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:36,000
SMILE A LOT, DON'T TALK MUCH,
AND IF YOU FEEL A DRAFT,

207
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:38,403
CHECK YOUR FLY.

208
00:10:38,469 --> 00:10:39,904
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

209
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:41,973
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

210
00:10:50,248 --> 00:10:52,684
AND WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

211
00:10:52,717 --> 00:10:55,386
WELL,
I'M GOING TO BED.

212
00:10:55,453 --> 00:10:59,090
NOT AFTER THE WAY YOU
SPOKE TO ME AT DINNER,
YOU'RE NOT.

213
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:01,459
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, DALTON?

214
00:11:01,492 --> 00:11:03,561
THIS IS MY BED.
YOU GET THE HECK
OUTTA HERE.

215
00:11:03,594 --> 00:11:05,163
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE

216
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:08,099
BECAUSE THERE IS NO BED
ON MY SIDE OF THE LODGE.

217
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,834
WELL, GO SLEEP
IN THE CABIN.

218
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:11,936
YOU CAN HOLD YOUR
BREATH THAT LONG.

219
00:11:12,003 --> 00:11:13,871
ISN'T THAT
A GREAT IDEA?

220
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:15,807
WHY DON'T YOU TRY IT?!

221
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,709
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

THERE'S SOMETHING
COLD IN THE BED.

OH, THAT'S
MY TIRE IRON.

YOU EXPECTING A FLAT?

00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,043
IT'S FOR PROTECTION.

ARE LIKE THAT IN THEIR

OH, MY GOD, FOR REAL?

00:12:42,927 --> 00:12:44,161
HI, Mr GREEN.

245
00:12:44,228 --> 00:12:45,730
THANK YOU FOR
COMING IN.

246
00:12:45,763 --> 00:12:48,265
DIDN'T REALISE I HAD
A CHOICE, ACTUALLY.

247
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:51,769
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT IS SO
CUTE HOW YOU WEAR YOUR, UM,

248
00:12:51,836 --> 00:12:53,704
COSTUMES TO EVERY
ONE OF OUR MEETINGS.

249
00:12:53,738 --> 00:12:55,706
BUT REALLY,
IT'S NOT NECESSARY.

250
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,676
COSTUME?
OH, NO, NO, THESE
ARE MY LODGE CLOTHES.

RIGHT. RIGHT.

00:13:00,978 --> 00:13:03,714
AND YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST
GREAT TO WEAR THEM IN PUBLIC.

IT'S WACKY,

00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:07,952
AND A FANTASTIC WAY TO DRAW
ATTENTION TO YOURSELF.

255
00:13:07,985 --> 00:13:10,287
BUT WHAT WE NEED

256
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:15,493
IS FOR YOU TO DRAW ATTENTION
TO YOURSELF WHILE YOU'RE
ON TELEVISION.

257
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:19,830
THE NETWORK IS LOOKING FOR A
LITTLE MORE SHOCK VALUE.

NO, THAT DOESN'T COUNT.

00:13:26,504 --> 00:13:28,305
YOU NEED A
YOUNGER DEMOGRAPHIC,

AND VIOLENCE FOR NOW.

THAT ARE PERFECTLY FINE
FOR YOU TO USE DURING

I THINK YOU SHOULD GIVE
SOME OF THEM A TRY.

00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:46,957
WELL, I SAY THIS WORD QUITE A
BIT DURING THE HANDYMAN CORNER,

WHAT WE NEED.

YOU KNOW, WE MIGHT EVEN MOVE
YOUR SHOW TO A LATER TIME SLOT

00:13:55,165 --> 00:14:00,337
SO YOU COULD SAY WORDS LIKE,

SWEARING IS NOT YOUR THING.

277
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:10,548
OKAY, MAYBE
YOU COULD JUST, UM,

PUNCH ONE OF THE LODGE
MEMBERS IN THE FACE
ONCE IN A WHILE.

FOR THAT ONE TOO MUCH.

WELL, YOU KNOW,
YOU JUST FAKE IT.

YOU DON'T REALLY PUNCH THEM.

AND DO WHATEVER,
