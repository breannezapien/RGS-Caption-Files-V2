SUSTAIN THE INTEREST OF OUR

51
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:51,377
BECAUSE YOU INTRODUCED ME AS A

LOOKING FOR A PIECE OF WOOD THAT

72
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:21,941
WE COULD CARVE INTO SOMETHING.

73
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,409
AND WE SAID THAT 11:00 WOULD BE

74
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:24,076
THE CUTOFF.

AND FIRST PRIZE WOULD BE THAT

78
00:02:26,712 --> 00:02:28,214
YOUR ENTRY DIDN'T GO INTO THE

00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:31,417

OR MAYBE YOU RUN OVER AN ANIMAL

103
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:18,064
WHILE HE WAS YAWNING.

104
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,665
I GOT THIS ONE FROM OLD MAN

106

AND THROWING THEM OUT THE

00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,302
WINDOW.

108
00:03:23,302 --> 00:03:25,237
ANYWAY, THE FIRST STEP HERE IS

109
00:03:25,237 --> 00:03:27,340
TO GET THE HUBCAP OFF THERE.

110
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,612
ALL RIGHT, NOW, THIS PARTICULAR

111

WHEEL HAS BEEN ON THE TRUCK

112
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,716
SINCE I BOUGHT HER NEW.

113
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,783
AND SOME PEOPLE SAY YOU SHOULD

114
00:03:37,783 --> 00:03:38,884
ROTATE THE TIRES.

115
00:03:38,884 --> 00:03:40,419
I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT.

116
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:41,587
I MEAN, THEY GET ROTATED WHILE

117
00:03:41,587 --> 00:03:42,555
YOU'RE--

118
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,356
I MEAN, SO I THINK SOME PEOPLE

119
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,824
JUST LOOK FOR WORK.

120
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,058
BUT WITH THEM BEING ON THERE

121
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:47,760
THAT LONG, THESE NUTS ARE RUSTED

122
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,495
ON THERE LIKE COWL FLAPS ON A

WAFFLE IRON.

124
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:51,931
SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS THROW

125
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:54,633
IN SOME PENETRATING OIL.

126
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:55,501
AND I SAY, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE

127
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,703
GONNA PUT PENETRATING OIL ON IT,

128
00:03:57,703 --> 00:03:59,972
THERE'S NO SENSE BEING SKIMPY

129
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:01,307
AND HOLDING BACK.

130
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,475
YOU GOT TO SOAK--YOU GOT TO

131
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:03,909
REALLY, REALLY SOAK IT IN THERE

132
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:06,245
AND YOU KNOW, WE LIKE SOAKING

133
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:09,715
THINGS IN UP AT THE LODGE.

134
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:11,317
I MEAN, FOR THE PRICE OF A CAN

135
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:12,551
OF THIS STUFF, YOU KNOW,

136
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:18,657
IT'S VERY, VERY COST-EFFECTIVE.

137
00:04:18,657 --> 00:04:21,627
OH.

138
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:22,628
I LOVE THE SMELL OF THIS

139
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:24,797
STUFF.

140
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:25,865
YOU KNOW, IT'S STARTING TO

141
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,234
LOOSEN ME UP A LITTLE TOO.

142
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,202
WAIT A MINUTE.

143
00:04:36,141 --> 00:04:38,110
OKAY, MAYBE I USED A LITTLE

144
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,612
TOO MUCH OF THE

145
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,946
PENETRATING OIL THERE.

146
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:43,482
ANYWAY, NOW WE GOT TO LOOSEN OFF

147
00:04:43,482 --> 00:04:45,451
THE NUTS HERE.

148
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:51,323
ALL RIGHT, THAT'LL DO HER.

149
00:04:51,323 --> 00:04:52,524
NOW I GOT THE TIRE IRON.

150
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:53,826
PUT THE TIRE IRON ON THERE AND

151
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,861
IT'S A SIMPLE TOOL, BUT IT'S

152
00:04:55,861 --> 00:04:58,464
A USEFUL TOOL.

153
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,232
KIND OF LIKE MY BROTHER-IN-LAW.

154
00:05:00,232 --> 00:05:04,470
ALL RIGHT.

155
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,439
[grunting]

156
00:05:13,612 --> 00:05:15,481
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

157
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,348
WHAT WE'RE FINDING NOW IS THAT

158
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:18,884
THE NUTS ON THIS WHEEL ARE

159
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:20,953
TIGHTER THAN SAY, THE DISCS ON

160
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,788
MY SPINE.

161
00:05:22,788 --> 00:05:24,823
SO WE GOT TO SWITCH TO THE LAW

162
00:05:24,823 --> 00:05:26,025
OF THE LEVER.

163
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,460
WHICH IS, IF IT'S NOT WORKING,

164
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,429
LEAVE HER.

165
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:37,669
ALL RIGHT, WHAT I DO NOW IS

166
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:41,306
STICK THIS PIPE ON.

167
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:42,074
STICK THIS PIPE ON.

168
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:44,443
THIS ADDS SOME LEVERAGE.

169
00:05:44,443 --> 00:05:47,513
I CAN REALLY HORSE THIS DOWN

170
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,448
NOW.

171
00:05:49,448 --> 00:05:51,250
REALLY HORSE HER.

172
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,951
REALLY, REALLY,

173
00:05:52,951 --> 00:05:56,021
REALLY HORSE HER DOWN.

174
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:56,688
ALL RIGHT, IT'S GOING.

175
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:58,023
IT'S GOING, GOING, GOING, GOING,

176
00:05:58,023 --> 00:05:59,992
GOING, GOING, GOING.

177
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:10,269
OH!

178
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,638
WELL, AS CONFUCIUS SAY, "IF AT

179
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,640
FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED,

180
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,742
SWITCH TO POWER TOOLS."

181
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:18,477
YOU KNOW, A ROCKET WINCH.

182
00:06:18,477 --> 00:06:19,711
RACKET RINCH, RACKING SHRINCH,

183
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:21,446
REN--IT'S A WRENCH.

184
00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:23,215
PUT THAT ON HERE.

185
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:25,817
AND WHOA!

186
00:06:25,817 --> 00:06:30,055
ALL RIGHT.

187
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:31,123
ALL RIGHT, WHAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE

188
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:32,991
TO DO IS SWITCH TO AN INNOVATIVE

189
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:34,560
ALTERNATIVE TO THE NORMAL

190
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,662
TIRE-CHANGING TECHNOLOGY.

191
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:37,596
AND THIS WILL REQUIRE THE

192
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:39,831
HANDYMAN'S SECRET WEAPON,

193
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:41,800
DUCT TAPE.

194
00:06:45,504 --> 00:06:47,472
WHAT WE DO IS, WE'VE DUCT-TAPED

195
00:06:47,472 --> 00:06:49,942
THE SPARE TIRE RIGHT ON TO THE

196
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,109
FLAT THERE.

197
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:52,511
OF COURSE NOW, THIS IS ONLY

198
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:55,681
TEMPORARY UNLESS IT WORKS.

199
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,149
SO THAT'S GOT HER DONE.

200
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:59,651
REMEMBER, TILL THE NEXT TIME,

201
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:00,485
IF THE WOMEN DON'T FIND YOU

202
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:01,753
HANDSOME, THEY SHOULD AT LEAST

203
00:07:01,753 --> 00:07:03,722
FIND YOU HANDY.

204
00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:24,376
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH THE

205
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:25,177
RESULTS OF THE WHITTLING

206
00:07:25,177 --> 00:07:26,645
CONTEST.

207
00:07:26,645 --> 00:07:28,714
>> IF THERE'S TIME.

208
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,682
WE CAN ONLY HOPE.

209
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:47,365
>> IT IS SPRING.

210
00:07:47,365 --> 00:07:48,600
THE GROUNDHOG COMES OUT OF HIS

211
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,669
HOLE AND SEES HIS SHADOW.

212
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:51,803
IT IS THE SHADOW OF MY RIGHT

213
00:07:51,803 --> 00:07:53,839
FRONT TIRE.

214
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,940
THAT MEANS WINTER WILL LAST

215
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,575
ANOTHER SIX WEEKS.

216
00:07:56,575 --> 00:07:58,543
BUT NOT FOR HIM.

217
00:08:02,547 --> 00:08:04,516
SO, AS I WAS SAYING EARLIER,

218
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:05,484
WE HAD THE JUDGING FOR THE

219
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:08,520
WHITTLING CONTEST, ABOUT 11:00.

220
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,088
STINKY PETERSON WENT FIRST.

221
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:11,423
HE HELD UP A TREE BRANCH THAT HE

222
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:14,125
CARVED OUT OF THE COFFEE TABLE.

223
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,026
DID A HECK OF A NICE JOB ON IT

224
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:15,994
TOO.

225
00:08:15,994 --> 00:08:17,128
AND OLD MAN SEDGEWICK GOT UP.

226
00:08:17,128 --> 00:08:17,996
BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO

227
00:08:17,996 --> 00:08:18,830
SHOW BECAUSE HE THOUGHT

228
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,600
WE'D SAID "WHISTLING CONTEST."

229
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,767
AND HE WAS REALLY MAD BECAUSE

230
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:23,802
HE'D GONE THE WHOLE EVENING

231
00:08:23,802 --> 00:08:25,871
WITHOUT EATING CRACKERS.

232
00:08:25,871 --> 00:08:27,138
AND HE HAD TAKEN HIS TEETH OUT,

233
00:08:27,138 --> 00:08:28,006
WHICH EXPLAINED WHY MOOSE

234
00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:28,807
THOMPSON COULDN'T GET

235
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:29,808
COMFORTABLE IN THE NAUGAHYDE

236
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:31,543
RECLINER.

237
00:08:31,543 --> 00:08:32,978
>> EXCUSE ME, UNCLE RED.

238
00:08:32,978 --> 00:08:33,778
I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT THE

239
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:35,714
FLOW OF THIS FASCINATING STORY

240
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:37,949
YOU'RE ARTICULATING SO WELL, BUT

241
00:08:37,949 --> 00:08:38,850
I WAS JUST WONDERING, I'VE GOT

242
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,385
A LITTLE PROBLEM.

243
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:41,186
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS CONTROL

244
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:41,886
DOES?

245
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:43,855
>> NO, I DON'T, HAROLD.

246
00:08:45,657 --> 00:08:47,626

254
00:09:01,873 --> 00:09:04,442
>> NO, MY RV'S DOLORES.

255
00:09:04,442 --> 00:09:06,411
MY EX-WIFE'S NAME IS SOMETHING

256
00:09:06,411 --> 00:09:07,312

257

00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:29,434
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE

275
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:30,435
A NUMBER.

276
00:09:30,435 --> 00:09:31,503

00:10:56,354 --> 00:10:57,255
AND YOU KNOW IT

343
00:10:57,255 --> 00:10:59,257
GET UP OUT OF YOUR CHAIR

344
00:10:59,257 --> 00:10:59,957
GET IN YOUR CAR

345
00:10:59,957 --> 00:11:00,758
>> ALL RIGHT, GET IN IT.

346
00:11:00,758 --> 00:11:01,426
>>  GET THE HELL

347
00:11:01,426 --> 00:11:02,093
 AWAY FROM HERE

348
00:11:02,093 --> 00:11:02,827
 AS FAST AS YOU CAN

349
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:04,128
>> QUICKER THAN THAT EVEN.

350
00:11:04,128 --> 00:11:06,097
>> ALL RIGHT, THAT WENT WELL.

351
00:11:10,234 --> 00:11:11,335
>> OH, UNCLE RED, THIS IS SO

352
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:12,103
GREAT.

353
00:11:12,103 --> 00:11:12,970
IT'S VIEWER MALE TIME.

354
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,105
THIS IS MY FAVORITE PART OF THE

355
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:15,707
SHOW AND MANY PEOPLE'S AS WELL,

356
00:11:15,707 --> 00:11:16,507
'CAUSE THIS HAS GONE FROM

357
00:11:16,507 --> 00:11:17,809
A POTENTIAL LIABILITY TO AN

358
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:18,743
OBVIOUS HIGHLIGHT IN THE

359
00:11:18,743 --> 00:11:20,445
PROGRAM, TO WHICH I ATTRIBUTE

360
00:11:20,445 --> 00:11:22,146
ONLY THE FACT THAT I HAVE ADDED

361
00:11:22,146 --> 00:11:24,248
SO MANY PRODUCTION VALUES,

362
00:11:24,248 --> 00:11:24,916
AND EVERYTHING THAT IS

363
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,184
HAPPENING IS DUE TO ME.

364
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:27,085
I TRULY BELIEVE THAT.

365
00:11:27,085 --> 00:11:28,186
>> JUST READ THE LETTER, HAROLD.

366
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:28,953
>> I'LL JUST GET RIGHT TO THE

367
00:11:28,953 --> 00:11:29,987
LETTER ACTUALLY.

368
00:11:29,987 --> 00:11:30,755
YOU SEE, NOW THAT'S GOOD,

369
00:11:30,755 --> 00:11:31,656
BECAUSE YOU'RE HELPING WITH THE

370
00:11:31,656 --> 00:11:32,323
PACING AND STUFF.

371
00:11:32,323 --> 00:11:33,124
THAT'S REALLY GREAT THAT YOU

372
00:11:33,124 --> 00:11:34,025
REMIND ME OF THOSE THINGS.

373
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:34,892
THIS LETTER TODAY IS FROM

374
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:35,760
QUEBEC.

375
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,694
[laughs]

376
00:11:36,694 --> 00:11:39,263
"DEAR ROUGE VERT, I'M TRYING TO

377
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:40,131
UNDERSTAND YOUR SHOW,

378
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:41,032
BUT THE LANGUAGE IS SO

379
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:42,066
CONFUSING.

380
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:43,401
COULD YOU PLEASE HELP ME?

381
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:44,268
TELL ME THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

382
00:11:44,268 --> 00:11:45,870
A MOUNTAIN LION, A PUMA,

383
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,538
AND A COUGAR?"

384
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:48,339
>> WELL, HAROLD, BASICALLY,

385
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:49,207
THE SPELLING.

386
00:11:49,207 --> 00:11:50,641
OTHER THAN THAT, THOSE THREE ARE

387
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:51,909
ALL THE SAME ANIMAL.

388
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:53,177
>> WHAT?

389
00:11:53,177 --> 00:11:54,245
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

390
00:11:54,245 --> 00:11:55,513
LIKE, THEY'RE IN THE SAME FAMILY

391
00:11:55,513 --> 00:11:56,380
OR SOMETHING?

392
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,215
'CAUSE THEY'RE NOT THE SAME

393
00:11:57,215 --> 00:11:58,216
ANIMAL.

394
00:11:58,216 --> 00:11:59,383
UNLESS OF COURSE YOU COMPLETELY

395
00:11:59,383 --> 00:12:00,818
MISUNDERSTOOD MY MAMMAL VOLUME

396
00:12:00,818 --> 00:12:01,919
OF THE TIME-LIFE BOOKS

397
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,888
I GOT AT THE IGA.

398
00:12:03,888 --> 00:12:04,555
>> NO, THOSE ARE THE SAME

399
00:12:04,555 --> 00:12:06,557
ANIMAL, HAROLD.

400
00:12:06,557 --> 00:12:07,692
SEE, IN ENGLISH, WE HAVE SLANG

401
00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:08,359
WORDS.

402
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:09,861
SO, WE'LL SAY GROUNDHOG

403
00:12:09,861 --> 00:12:10,895
OR WE'LL CALL IT A GOPHER.

404
00:12:10,895 --> 00:12:12,496
IT'S THE SAME ANIMAL.

405
00:12:12,496 --> 00:12:13,397
OR A DEER, WE'LL CALL IT

406
00:12:13,397 --> 00:12:16,000
A DOE OR A STAG OR A BUCK.

407
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,968
IF YOU HAVE A CAMEL WITH ONE

408
00:12:16,968 --> 00:12:19,136
HUMP, WE CALL THAT A DROMEDARY.

409
00:12:19,136 --> 00:12:20,671
IF THE CAMEL HAS THREE HUMPS,

410
00:12:20,671 --> 00:12:23,474
WE CALL THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER.

411
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:24,875
AND OF COURSE WITH A BEAVER,

412
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,777
WE'LL CALL THAT A MUSKRAT

413
00:12:26,777 --> 00:12:27,645
OR A BADGER.

414
00:12:27,645 --> 00:12:29,780
BUT THEY'RE ALL THE SAME ANIMAL.

415
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,148
>> WHAT, REALLY?

416
00:12:31,148 --> 00:12:32,083
>> OH, YEAH.

417
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,150
AND ANOTHER THING PEOPLE DON'T

418
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:36,120
REALIZE IS THAT A MOOSE AND AN

419
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,889
ELK AND A MOUNTAIN GOAT,

420
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:40,224
ALL THREE OF THOSE, THEY ARE

421
00:12:40,224 --> 00:12:40,992
THE SAME ANIMAL.

422
00:12:40,992 --> 00:12:42,793
AND ALSO A WOODPECKER.

423
00:12:42,793 --> 00:12:44,061
ALL FOUR OF THEM ACTUALLY ARE

424
00:12:44,061 --> 00:12:45,196
THE SAME ANIMAL.

425
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:46,430
>> OH, NO WAY.

426
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,965
NO, THAT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE.

427
00:12:47,965 --> 00:12:48,966
I DON'T EVEN BELIEVE THAT.

428
00:12:48,966 --> 00:12:49,700
NO WAY.

429
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,668
I THINK THERE'S A DRAMATIC

430
00:12:50,668 --> 00:12:51,669
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A WOODPECKER

431
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:53,771
AND A MOUNTAIN GOAT.

432
00:12:53,771 --> 00:12:54,505
>> WELL, ARE YOU CALLING ME

433
00:12:54,505 --> 00:12:55,406
A LIAR, HAROLD?

434
00:12:55,406 --> 00:12:56,273
>> OH, NO, NO, NO, UNCLE RED,

435
00:12:56,273 --> 00:12:57,274
NO, NO.

436
00:12:57,274 --> 00:12:58,275
I WOULDN'T CALL YOU A LIAR.

437
00:12:58,275 --> 00:12:59,043
JUST, YOU KNOW, YOU COULD BE

438
00:12:59,043 --> 00:13:01,946
OPERATING UNDER SHEER IGNORANCE.

439
00:13:01,946 --> 00:13:02,980
>> OKAY.

440
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,949
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

441
00:13:09,453 --> 00:13:10,688
SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT

442
00:13:10,688 --> 00:13:11,722
ON THE ADVENTURES WITH BILL

443
00:13:11,722 --> 00:13:13,224
THIS WEEK.

444
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:14,492
BILL THOUGHT HE'D SHOW YOU THAT

445
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:15,292
HE'S A, YOU KNOW, A BIT OF

446
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:15,960
A SPORT.

447
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,029
A BIT OF A NATURAL, WELL--NOT

448
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:20,431
REALLY NATURAL ANYTHING I GUESS.

449
00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:22,867
BUT HE THOUGHT HE'D SHOW YOU

450
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:24,602
ABOUT OF WATER SKIING.

451
00:13:24,602 --> 00:13:25,603
YOU KNOW, I THINK MAYBE CLEANING

452
00:13:25,603 --> 00:13:29,173
OFF THE DOCK MIGHT HAVE BEEN--

453
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:32,643
WELL, YOU KNOW.

454
00:13:32,643 --> 00:13:33,477
ANYWAY, HE GETS HIMSELF

455
00:13:33,477 --> 00:13:35,146
SET UP THERE.

456
00:13:35,146 --> 00:13:35,880
THIS IS THE WAY HE'S GONNA

457
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,716
TAKE OFF.

458
00:13:38,716 --> 00:13:39,850
NOW, HE WANTED TO EXPLAIN TO ME

459
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,018
THE HAND SIGNALS.

460
00:13:41,018 --> 00:13:43,854
SPEED UP, SLOW DOWN.

461
00:13:43,854 --> 00:13:47,057
GO STRAIGHT, TURN LEFT,

462
00:13:47,057 --> 00:13:47,758
I GOT A CORD--

463
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:49,560
ANYWAY, WHATEVER.

464
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,628
AND THEN THIS STUFF, I'M JUST

465
00:13:50,628 --> 00:13:52,596
AS GLAD I MISSED OUT ON.

466
00:13:54,098 --> 00:13:55,232
ANYWAY, HE'S ALL SET, THROWS THE

467
00:13:55,232 --> 00:13:56,667
ROPE IN, AND GIVES ME THE

468
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:57,368
SIGNAL.

469
00:13:57,368 --> 00:13:58,769
AND I LOVE THIS PART.

470
00:13:58,769 --> 00:13:59,837
I JUST LOVE JUST GIVING UP

471
00:13:59,837 --> 00:14:01,572
THE GAS, AND YEAH.

472
00:14:01,572 --> 00:14:02,706
WELL, THERE YOU ARE.

473
00:14:02,706 --> 00:14:05,175
OH, OH, OH.

474
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:08,612
BOY, OH, BOY.

475
00:14:08,612 --> 00:14:10,814
OH, THAT'S A SHAME.

476
00:14:10,814 --> 00:14:11,849
THAT'S A SHAME.

477
00:14:11,849 --> 00:14:12,983
SO HE PUTS SOME OF THE GOALIE

478
00:14:12,983 --> 00:14:13,817
GLOVES ON.

479
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:14,885
LITTLE EASIER ON YOUR FINGERS,

480
00:14:14,885 --> 00:14:15,619
BUT THEN I COULDN'T GET

481
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:16,287
THE SIGNAL.

482
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:17,721
BUT, ANY--OKAY, I GOT IT.

483
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:19,123
OH, LOVE THIS PART.

484
00:14:19,123 --> 00:14:20,491
YEAH, YEAH.

485
00:14:20,491 --> 00:14:22,760
AND AWAY WE GO.

486
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,194
BUT LOOKIT, HIS SKI GOT THE FIN

487
00:14:24,194 --> 00:14:25,462
JAMMED BETWEEN THE BOARDS

488
00:14:25,462 --> 00:14:26,463
ON THE DOCK THERE.

489
00:14:26,463 --> 00:14:28,432
AND WHAT A SHAME.

490
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:32,603
WATER SKIING'S KIND OF

491
00:14:32,603 --> 00:14:33,270
DANGEROUS.

492
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,104
HE TRIED TO GET A LITTLE CLOSER

493
00:14:34,104 --> 00:14:37,841
TO THE EDGE OF, WELL, OH, OH--

494
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:38,542
MAYBE A LITTLE TOO CLOSE.

495
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:39,777
NOW HE SITS FARTHER BACK.

496
00:14:39,777 --> 00:14:41,412
SO, HE WON'T, OH, LOOKS GOOD,

497
00:14:41,412 --> 00:14:42,246
LOOKS GOOD, LOOKS GOOD.

498
00:14:42,246 --> 00:14:45,349
OH, OH, OH.

499
00:14:45,349 --> 00:14:47,551
OH, WELL, I THINK HE'S OKAY.

500
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,552
YOU OKAY, BILL?

501
00:14:48,552 --> 00:14:49,620
YEAH. YEAH.

502
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,721
HE'S FINE. ALL RIGHT.

503
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:51,822
THIS WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING.

504
00:14:51,822 --> 00:14:54,958
HE WAS BRINGING THE SKI IN.

505
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,427
AND HE GAVE ME THE SIGNAL,

506
00:14:56,427 --> 00:14:57,695
MEANING HE HAD THE SKI,

507
00:14:57,695 --> 00:14:58,595
BUT I THOUGHT THAT--

508
00:14:58,595 --> 00:14:59,396
'CAUSE I LOVE THIS PART,

509
00:14:59,396 --> 00:15:01,965
YOU KNOW, AND, OH, BOY.

510
00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:05,636
I FELT BAD.

511
00:15:05,636 --> 00:15:06,570
HE'S OKAY NOW.

512
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,038
NOW HE FINALLY FIGURED OUT, SIT

513
00:15:08,038 --> 00:15:09,073
ON THE EDGE OF THE DOCK,

514
00:15:09,073 --> 00:15:09,973
AND THAT WAY YOU CAN

515
00:15:09,973 --> 00:15:10,941
CONTROL IT BETTER.

516
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:11,842
GIVE ME THE--THIS IS AWAY

517
00:15:11,842 --> 00:15:12,776
WE GO.

518
00:15:12,776 --> 00:15:13,444
OH, BOY.

519
00:15:13,444 --> 00:15:14,111
LOVE THE BOAT.

520
00:15:14,111 --> 00:15:15,946
LOVE IT.

521
00:15:15,946 --> 00:15:17,081
WHAT HE DIDN'T NOTICE, I GUESS,

522
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:17,981
AND I DIDN'T EITHER, WAS THAT

523
00:15:17,981 --> 00:15:19,416
THE ROPE WAS KIND OF TIED

524
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,083
AROUND.

525
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,452
AND I WAS KIND OF BUSY DRIVING

526
00:15:21,452 --> 00:15:23,954
THERE, AND SO HE THOUGHT HE'D--

527
00:15:23,954 --> 00:15:24,755
I THINK HE JUST KIND OF

528
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:26,824
GOT READY FOR A BIG JOLT THERE.

529
00:15:26,824 --> 00:15:28,058
BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY, OH, OH.

530
00:15:28,058 --> 00:15:32,029
OW.

531
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:34,131
AND, UH, BILL'S OKAY.

532
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:34,798
YOU KNOW.

533
00:15:34,798 --> 00:15:36,767
HE'S TIED UP FOR THE WEEKEND.

534
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:39,169
>> OKAY, FIRST WE GOT TO FLIP

535
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:41,705
THE COVER OFF THIS MOTOR.

536
00:15:41,705 --> 00:15:42,406
LIFT UP THE SIDE THERE

537
00:15:42,406 --> 00:15:43,073
AND FLIP 'EM UP AND--

538
00:15:43,073 --> 00:15:43,740
>> THIS HERE?

539
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,942
>> THAT'S IT.

540
00:15:44,942 --> 00:15:45,642
>> OKAY.

541
00:15:45,642 --> 00:15:46,810
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

542
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:47,477
YEAH.

543
00:15:47,477 --> 00:15:48,145
ALL RIGHT.

544
00:15:48,145 --> 00:15:49,680
>> OKAY, NOW I NEED THE CORDLESS

545
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,248
DRILL.

546
00:15:51,248 --> 00:15:52,549
>> OH, THAT'S RIGHT HERE.

547
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:54,518
>> AND I NEED THE BUFFING WHEEL.

548
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,622
>> OKAY.

549
00:15:58,622 --> 00:15:59,856
>> NOW, I WANT YOU TO SLAP THESE

550
00:15:59,856 --> 00:16:01,792
TOGETHER.

551
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:03,393
>> OKAY.

552
00:16:03,393 --> 00:16:06,230
THIS JUST--THE NAIL GOES THROUGH

553
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,130
HERE AND CLIPS IN.

554
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:07,831
IS THAT HOW SHE WORKS?

555
00:16:07,831 --> 00:16:08,498
>> THAT'S IT.

556
00:16:08,498 --> 00:16:09,800
>> YEAH.

557
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,703
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

558
00:16:12,703 --> 00:16:13,804
>> NOW, CAN YOU TAKE THAT UP

559
00:16:13,804 --> 00:16:15,038
TO THE FRONT AND JUST BUFF THE

560
00:16:15,038 --> 00:16:18,475
BUMPER WHILE I FIX THE MOTOR?

561
00:16:18,475 --> 00:16:19,509
>> YOU WANT ME TO DO THAT?

562
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:20,777
>> WELL, RED, I'M TAKING TIME

563
00:16:20,777 --> 00:16:21,745
OFF FROM CLEANING THE RV

564
00:16:21,745 --> 00:16:24,147
TO FIX YOUR MOTOR.

565
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:25,282
>> ALL RIGHT.

566
00:16:25,282 --> 00:16:27,250
FAIR ENOUGH.

567
00:16:32,422 --> 00:16:34,992
>> NOT TOO HARD.

568
00:16:34,992 --> 00:16:35,959
>> WHAT?

569
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:36,827
>> DON'T TAKE THE PAINT RIGHT

570
00:16:36,827 --> 00:16:37,728
OFF THE BUMPER.

571
00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:38,762
NOT TOO HARD.

572
00:16:38,762 --> 00:16:40,731
>> OH.

573
00:16:50,774 --> 00:16:51,742
HOW'S IT GOING?

574
00:16:51,742 --> 00:16:53,076
>> OH, JUST TAKING A BREAK.

575
00:16:53,076 --> 00:16:54,044
LETTING THE LUBRICANTS GET TO

576
00:16:54,044 --> 00:16:55,245
THE BOLTS.

577
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:57,581
>> OH, ALL RIGHT.

578
00:16:57,581 --> 00:16:59,649
I'LL JUST GO FINISH UP THEN.

579
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:00,484
>> YEAH, JUST GET UNDERNEATH.

580
00:17:00,484 --> 00:17:01,251
YOU GETTING IT UNDERNEATH?

581
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:01,918
I LIKE IT NICE AND CLEAN

582
00:17:01,918 --> 00:17:02,586
UNDERNEATH.

583
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:04,554
>> YEAH. YEAH.

584
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,251
>> OKAY, RED.

585
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:35,852
I'M FINISHED.

586
00:17:35,852 --> 00:17:37,320
>> GREAT, GREAT.

587
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,688
YEAH, ME TOO.

588
00:17:38,688 --> 00:17:41,391
SO WHAT'S THE WORD HERE?

589
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:42,559
>> WELL, YOU SEE THE CORD THERE?

590
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,226
>> YEAH.

591
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:44,194
>> TAKE IT OFF.

592
00:17:44,194 --> 00:17:45,529
TIE A KNOT IN THE END OF IT.

593
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:46,663
PUT IT BACK ON THE WHEEL.

594
00:17:46,663 --> 00:17:47,597
IT SHOULD BE FINE.

595
00:17:47,597 --> 00:17:49,833
READY TO GO.

596
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,468
>> WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO THEN?

597
00:17:51,468 --> 00:17:53,203
>> WELL, I REPLACED THE HOUSING,

598
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:54,237
CLEANED OUT THE VALVES,

599
00:17:54,237 --> 00:17:55,906
AND CLEANED UP THE PROP

600
00:17:55,906 --> 00:17:58,108
BACK THERE.

601
00:17:58,108 --> 00:17:59,910
>> OH, THAT WAS REAL FAST.

602
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,112
THAT WAS INCREDIBLY FAST.

603
00:18:02,112 --> 00:18:03,113
THAT WAS ALMOST TOO FAST,

604
00:18:03,113 --> 00:18:04,781
WASN'T IT?

605
00:18:04,781 --> 00:18:05,582
>> WELL, CAN I TAKE YOU

606
00:18:05,582 --> 00:18:07,450
FOR A RIDE NOW?

607
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,218
>> NO, I THINK YOU JUST DID,

608
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:10,186
GLEN.

609
00:18:11,621 --> 00:18:12,989
IT IS SPRING.

610
00:18:12,989 --> 00:18:14,791
AS I LOOK FROM MY WINDOW, I SEE

611
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:17,260
DOGS MATING ON MY FRONT LAWN,

612
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,329
CATS MATING ON THE SHED ROOF,

613
00:18:19,329 --> 00:18:21,898
MOOSE RUNNING IN THE FOREST.

614
00:18:21,898 --> 00:18:24,134
I WATCH, MILDLY BEMUSED.

615
00:18:24,134 --> 00:18:25,435
THEN I GO TO THE WORKSHOP

616
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:27,404
AND DESIGN A NEW TRAILER HITCH.

617
00:18:42,385 --> 00:18:43,820
>> I HAVE A DREAM.

618
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,188
I HAVE A DREAM.

619
00:18:45,188 --> 00:18:46,689
DO YOU KNOW WHO SAID THAT?

620
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:48,658
>> LARRY HAGMAN.

621
00:18:51,194 --> 00:18:53,863
>> HEY, WATCH IT, RED!

622
00:18:53,863 --> 00:18:55,064
>> NO, "I HAVE A DREAM" WAS SAID

623
00:18:55,064 --> 00:18:56,833
BY MARTIN LUTHER KING.

624
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,134
I HAVE A DREAM TOO.

625
00:18:58,134 --> 00:18:59,502
IT'S A DREAM WHERE I'M RUNNING

626
00:18:59,502 --> 00:19:01,371
DOWN A HALL AND I'M NAKED.

627
00:19:01,371 --> 00:19:02,038
YOU KNOW?

628
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:02,705
AND I'M BEING CHASED BY

629
00:19:02,705 --> 00:19:03,706
ALL THESE PEOPLE.

630
00:19:03,706 --> 00:19:05,408
PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT CREEDS

631
00:19:05,408 --> 00:19:07,644
AND COLORS AND SEXES AND INCOME

632
00:19:07,644 --> 00:19:08,711
BRACKETS AND SEXUAL

633
00:19:08,711 --> 00:19:09,779
ORIENTATIONS.

634
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:10,713
IT'S HUGE.

635
00:19:10,713 --> 00:19:11,748
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE

636
00:19:11,748 --> 00:19:12,782
CHASING--IT'S LIKE A STADIUM

637
00:19:12,782 --> 00:19:15,418
EMPTIED ON ME OR SOMETHING.

638
00:19:15,418 --> 00:19:16,452
>> DOES THIS STORY HAVE A TWIST

639
00:19:16,452 --> 00:19:17,187
ENDING, HAROLD?

640
00:19:17,187 --> 00:19:18,087
LIKE, YOU KNOW, FOR EXAMPLE,

641
00:19:18,087 --> 00:19:18,922
A POINT?

642
00:19:18,922 --> 00:19:19,589
>> OH, YEAH.

643
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:21,558
YEAH.

644
00:19:21,558 --> 00:19:23,626
[creature wailing]

645
00:19:23,626 --> 00:19:24,427
I JUST THINK THAT PEOPLE

646
00:19:24,427 --> 00:19:25,929
SHOULDN'T BE JUDGED BY THE COLOR

647
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:27,330
OF THEIR SKIN OR THE SHADE OF

648
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,364
THEIR SKIN OR THE CONDITION OF

649
00:19:28,364 --> 00:19:29,399
THEIR SKIN.

650
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:30,266
SO MY POINT IS, I DON'T LIKE

651
00:19:30,266 --> 00:19:32,535
BEING CALLED ZIT FACE.

652
00:19:32,535 --> 00:19:33,703
>> YOU'RE SENSITIVE, HAROLD.

653
00:19:33,703 --> 00:19:35,572
>> YEAH, BUT NO, BECAUSE I DON'T

654
00:19:35,572 --> 00:19:36,339
THINK YOU SHOULD MAKE FUN

655
00:19:36,339 --> 00:19:37,040
OF PIMPLES.

656
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,641
'CAUSE ACNE IS ONLY ONE LETTER

657
00:19:38,641 --> 00:19:40,276
DIFFERENT THAN ACME,

658
00:19:40,276 --> 00:19:41,911
WHICH IS LIKE THE BEST.

659
00:19:41,911 --> 00:19:43,580
OR ONE LETTER MORE THAN THE WORD

660
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,214
"ACE," WHICH IS NUMERO UNO,

661
00:19:45,214 --> 00:19:48,284
ALSO, THE BEST.

662
00:19:48,284 --> 00:19:49,152
>> YEAH, I'LL AGREE WITH THAT,

663
00:19:49,152 --> 00:19:49,819
HAROLD.

664
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:50,653
I THINK YOUR PIMPLES ARE

665
00:19:50,653 --> 00:19:51,854
THE BEST I'VE SEEN.

666
00:19:51,854 --> 00:19:53,823
>> EXACTLY.

667
00:19:59,662 --> 00:20:00,430
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE WE WON'T

668
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,364
HAVE TIME TO GET BACK TO THAT

669
00:20:01,364 --> 00:20:03,299
WHITTLING CONTEST STORY.

670
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:04,834
SO, STAY TUNED.

671
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:06,869
OH, THAT'S A SHAME.

672
00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:07,971
>> SO INSTEAD, I'M GONNA WHITTLE

673
00:20:07,971 --> 00:20:10,773
HAROLD INTO SOMETHING USEFUL.

674
00:20:10,773 --> 00:20:13,009
THAT'S A SHAME.

675
00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:14,110
WHAT'D YOU DO AGAIN?

676
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,211
>> WELL, I JUST--I HAD--

677
00:20:15,211 --> 00:20:16,946
I TOOK THIS OFF.

678
00:20:16,946 --> 00:20:17,613
>> YEAH.

679
00:20:17,613 --> 00:20:18,281
>> CLEANED IT.

680
00:20:18,281 --> 00:20:18,948
>> YEAH.

681
00:20:18,948 --> 00:20:20,717
>> I REPLACED THE HOUSING.

682
00:20:20,717 --> 00:20:21,651
>> THAT'S THE SAME HOUSING.

683
00:20:21,651 --> 00:20:22,452
>> YEAH.

684
00:20:22,452 --> 00:20:24,387
WELL, NO, I TOOK IT OFF

685
00:20:24,387 --> 00:20:26,089
AND PUT IT BACK ON.

686
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:26,756
THAT'S WHAT I MEANT

687
00:20:26,756 --> 00:20:27,423
BY REPLACING.

688
00:20:27,423 --> 00:20:28,091
>> WHY?

689
00:20:28,091 --> 00:20:28,925
>> WELL, 'CAUSE IT NEEDED TO BE

690
00:20:28,925 --> 00:20:30,159
TIGHTENED UP, YOU KNOW.

691
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,129
AND THEN, I TOOK THE VALVES

692
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:35,064
AND CLEANED THOSE UP, SO.

693
00:20:35,064 --> 00:20:35,832
>> THERE'S NO VALVES IN THIS

694
00:20:35,832 --> 00:20:36,499
MOTOR.

695
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:37,600
JUST A TWO-CYCLE.

696
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,769
>> OH, WELL, I MEANT THESE HERE.

697
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:40,837
I ALWAYS GET VALVES AND SPARK

698
00:20:40,837 --> 00:20:41,938
PLUGS ALL MIXED UP ALL THE TIME.

699
00:20:41,938 --> 00:20:43,172
I TOOK THEM OUT.

700
00:20:43,172 --> 00:20:44,874
A LITTLE SANDPAPER AND PUT THEM

701
00:20:44,874 --> 00:20:45,541
BACK IN.

702
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:46,275
>> YOU TOOK OUT THESE SPARK

703
00:20:46,275 --> 00:20:46,943
PLUGS?

704
00:20:46,943 --> 00:20:49,846
>> THAT'S THE ONE, YEAH.

705
00:20:49,846 --> 00:20:50,880
>> THESE--WITHOUT TAKING

706
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,647
THE WIRES OFF?

707
00:20:51,647 --> 00:20:52,515
>> OH, YEAH, THAT'S EASY ENOUGH

708
00:20:52,515 --> 00:20:53,249
TO DO.

709
00:20:53,249 --> 00:20:55,084
JUST GIVE IT A GOOD UNF ON IT,

710
00:20:55,084 --> 00:20:56,719
IT COMES RIGHT OUT.

711
00:20:56,719 --> 00:20:57,487
OF COURSE, WHEN YOU PUT THEM

712
00:20:57,487 --> 00:20:58,488
BACK IN, YOU GOT TO GET

713
00:20:58,488 --> 00:21:00,590
A HAMMER.

714
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,424
>> HOW MUCH YOU GONNA CHARGE ME

715
00:21:01,424 --> 00:21:02,758
FOR THIS, GLEN?

716
00:21:02,758 --> 00:21:05,161
>> OH, LET'S SEE, THERE'S MY

717
00:21:05,161 --> 00:21:07,130
HOURLY RATE AND THE PARTS.

718
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:13,069
>> I'D LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS

719
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:14,937
TO YOU TEENAGERS OUT THERE.

720
00:21:14,937 --> 00:21:15,705
I HOPE I CAUGHT YOU BETWEEN

721
00:21:15,705 --> 00:21:18,007
MUSIC VIDEOS.

722
00:21:18,007 --> 00:21:19,742
MY MESSAGE IS SIMPLE.

723
00:21:19,742 --> 00:21:20,710
STAY IN SCHOOL.

724
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,478
STAY IN SCHOOL.

725
00:21:22,478 --> 00:21:24,313
SCHOOL GETS OUT AT 3:30.

726
00:21:24,313 --> 00:21:26,249
STAY AN EXTRA HOUR.

727
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:27,617
IT WON'T KILL YA.

728
00:21:27,617 --> 00:21:28,551
MAYBE YOU CAN GO DOWN

729
00:21:28,551 --> 00:21:29,719
TO THE LIBRARY,

730
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:31,320
OPEN A THICK BOOK.

731
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,188
YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ IT.

732
00:21:32,188 --> 00:21:34,523
IT JUST MAKES AN IMPRESSION.

733
00:21:34,523 --> 00:21:35,358
ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S HARDLY

734
00:21:35,358 --> 00:21:37,360
ANY PICTURES IN IT.

735
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,361
BELIEVE ME, YOU'RE A LOT BETTER

736
00:21:38,361 --> 00:21:39,695
OFF STAYING IN SCHOOL, THEN YOU

737
00:21:39,695 --> 00:21:40,596
ARE GOING OVER TO A FRIEND'S

738
00:21:40,596 --> 00:21:42,198
GARAGE AND MAKING BOMBS OUT OF

739
00:21:42,198 --> 00:21:44,934
GUNPOWDER AND COPPER PIPES.

740
00:21:44,934 --> 00:21:46,102
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LOSE A FINGER

741
00:21:46,102 --> 00:21:47,837
IN THE LIBRARY,

742
00:21:47,837 --> 00:21:48,738
UNLESS SOMEBODY PUNCHES YOU IN

743
00:21:48,738 --> 00:21:50,606
THE NOSE.

744
00:21:50,606 --> 00:21:51,941
STAY IN SCHOOL.

745
00:21:51,941 --> 00:21:53,409
YOUR TEACHERS DID, AND THEY'RE

746
00:21:53,409 --> 00:21:55,044
NOT DOING TOO BAD.

747
00:21:55,044 --> 00:21:57,446
THEY GET THE WHOLE SUMMER OFF.

748
00:21:57,446 --> 00:21:59,415
STAY IN SCHOOL.

749
00:22:05,888 --> 00:22:08,257
SO, ANYWAY, 11:00 ROLLED AROUND,

750
00:22:08,257 --> 00:22:09,992
AND IT WAS TIME TO ADD UP ALL

751
00:22:09,992 --> 00:22:11,193
THE VOTES FOR THE WHITTLING

752
00:22:11,193 --> 00:22:12,728

755
00:22:15,598 --> 00:22:18,267

00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,009
AND THEN STINKY PETERSON TOOK

761
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:28,511

762

00:22:29,311 --> 00:22:31,247
OUTHOUSE DOOR.

764
00:22:31,247 --> 00:22:32,314
ACTUALLY HE WOULD HAVE WON, BUT

765
00:22:32,314 --> 00:22:33,749
THE FOOD KEPT FALLING THROUGH

766
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:36,318
THE MOON-SHAPED HOLE.

767
00:22:36,318 --> 00:22:38,254
BUT THE BIG GUY, MOOSE THOMPSON,

768
00:22:38,254 --> 00:22:40,923

773
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:49,265
SO, IT WAS A GREAT--ANYWAY, IF
