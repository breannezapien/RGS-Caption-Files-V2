1
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,473
And now it's time for a totally different
show.

2
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,611
A show based on the assumption that no
matter who you are or how busy you are.

3
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:49,115
You have at least one half hour to waste and
well, and here's a man who's wasted at least

4
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:53,453
half a century. My uncle, which is obviously
the downside of working with a severely

5
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:56,089
limited gene pool, but nobody's more than
the ones.

6
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:59,392
He's he's a Cushman and in most cases, a
huntsman.

7
00:01:01,794 --> 00:01:04,163
Anyway, here you star of the red dream show
Mr.

8
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:05,899
Red Green.

9
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,270
Thank you, Eric. Thank you.

10
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,105
And welcome to Possum Lodge.

11
00:01:12,538 --> 00:01:16,242
You've already met my nephew, Harold, who is
my brother's only child, which is certainly

12
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,076
understandable.

13
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,578
I got a neat one for you here off the rack.

14
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:19,112
Look at this one.

15
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:26,019
Well, Harold is responsible for the look of
the show, so don't come complaining to me

16
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:30,490
that they got a fun show for you this week,
although I must say I did start today with a

17
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,259
rude awakening, which sounds actually like
stinky Peterson.

18
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:37,997
But then when I got up and I washed my face
and I noticed there was no towel, and then I

19
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:40,500
noticed that my face wasn't wet, and then I
noticed there was no water.

20
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,871
And so I figure either the water pump is
broken again or Possum Lake evaporated.

21
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:47,807
I'll correct. Has anybody told Helmet?

22
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:51,944
Well, I don't think that's necessary,
Harold, because all you got to do is be

23
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:54,280
chewing on a cup of coffee and you realize
that we're out of water.

24
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:59,452
So the bunch of us were sitting around
chewing on cups of coffee, and old man Cedric

25
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:03,956
was, of course, sucking on a teabag, and he
was reminiscing about the good old days at

26
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:07,360
the lodge before they had any of the modern
amenities, you know, like a roof.

27
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:11,631
He said back then what they would do to make
coffee as they gloat and they gather up

28
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:17,036
condensation off the grass in the morning
or, as he put it, they may do so.

29
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,605
We nail them right on the scone with a
waffle iron for that one.

30
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,074
Don't you think you had a point, though?

31
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,678
Well, he certainly does. Now. Hurley's got
about thirty six little ones right up in

32
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:30,216
here. But OK, I guess we probably did
appreciate things more.

33
00:02:30,249 --> 00:02:33,352
You know, back when the dinosaurs roamed the
Earth, did they

34
00:02:33,352 --> 00:02:35,254
Even have like outhouses back then?

35
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:39,425
Yeah, they did. But there was no home anyway.

36
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:43,863
You know, once you get used to modern things
like a water pump or sweeping compound, you

37
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,565
know, it is very difficult to go back.

38
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,200
Well, I'm here to say that we're not going
back.

39
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,505
We're going forward because progress may be
destructive, inhumane, but technology sure is

40
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:52,805
neat.

41
00:02:54,106 --> 00:02:55,575
Well, unless it's a water pump.

42
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:01,581
At this washer and

43
00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:03,516
Urine bill and the blockage.

44
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:05,217
Ok, what do you

45
00:03:05,217 --> 00:03:07,887
Say you're blowing that and I'll see if the
back pressure valve closes.

46
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:18,798
Ok. Keep blowing helmet.

47
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:23,602
I just turned on the sink and all I got was
this gurgling noise like stinky minx, but no

48
00:03:23,602 --> 00:03:25,805
water came out. Is there anywhere in this
large?

49
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,406
I can wash my hands.

50
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:31,477
What am I asking you for your phone,
possibly at the other end of that dock?

51
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,346
Or you can wait until I'm done fixing this
pump.

52
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:40,820
I use the lake and please make me a list of
everything that you touch, especially food.

53
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:46,692
All that. Come on, have you ever noticed
that we seem to be having an inordinate

54
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:51,097
amount of breakdowns? You know, I'm just I'm
just, you know, like pipes and pumps and

55
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,131
stoves and doors.

56
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:56,702
You know, well, my TV equipment, it's a lot
more complicated and it hardly ever needs

57
00:03:56,702 --> 00:03:57,937
servicing, you know?

58
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:02,475
Why do you think it is? The infrastructure
of this lodge is in constant need of repair.

59
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,677
Why do you think that is, Harold?

60
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,545
This place is a dump filled with crap.

61
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:09,148
Ok. All right.

62
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,451
So what's the problem with the pump, their
helmet?

63
00:04:13,986 --> 00:04:15,254
You know, other than it's craftiness,

64
00:04:16,188 --> 00:04:19,425
It's either a CS bearing on the impeller
shaft or the back pressure valve.

65
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,493
Spring is fatigued.

66
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:24,029
Well, Mr. Pumps not feeling too well.

67
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:27,566
And neither is Bill.

68
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:35,608
Well, so are you working on your water pump
there, huh?

69
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:39,445
No. Harold, you want to go scare me up some
tin snips about seven feet of shoe leather

70
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:40,079
already.

71
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:43,616
Ok, we're getting seven feet of shoe leather
from seven different pairs of shoes.

72
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,520
Well, glad to hear your water pumps working
fine.

73
00:04:49,221 --> 00:04:53,158
Delighted, really, because you know, we just
dropped by to get ourselves a pail of fresh

74
00:04:53,158 --> 00:04:55,527
cold water. Now, where would we find your
nearest?

75
00:04:56,795 --> 00:04:57,897
Ok, Mary, all right.

76
00:04:57,897 --> 00:04:59,231
All right. The pump is broken.

77
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:02,234
The question was Where's the tap?

78
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:03,836
Don't you listen, Helmut?

79
00:05:04,036 --> 00:05:06,105
Dwayne, the pump is broken.

80
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:09,508
That means there is no water coming out of
the taps, which means you don't

81
00:05:09,508 --> 00:05:11,010
Need to know where the taps are.

82
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,212
Exactly. Told you.

83
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:15,948
Well, you're in luck today, helmet.

84
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,450
We're having a sale on water pumps down at
the store.

85
00:05:19,885 --> 00:05:21,587
We bought this one out for you on sale.

86
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,623
Wow. It's such a good memory.

87
00:05:25,257 --> 00:05:26,358
It's only been six weeks.

88
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:29,128
Our memory is as short as our warranty.

89
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:35,167
That's our slogan. Or is it our cream read?

90
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:40,606
I can sell you a brand new reconditioned
water pump out of a Mack truck, complete with

91
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:41,974
conversion kit for only one hundred

92
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:44,043
And fifty dollars. Maybe it's a model.

93
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,278
I can fix this one. Good as new for a
hundred bucks,

94
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:48,714
But what about you and Dwayne? What's your
offer?

95
00:05:49,648 --> 00:05:53,485
I can sell you a hot air corn popper for
fourteen point ninety five.

96
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:00,092
Well, I'm going to

97
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:02,861
I'm going have to think it over, guy, so I'll
let you know later.

98
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:06,999
Oh, by the time he thinks it over Bill and
I'll have this pump fixed.

99
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:08,901
Oh, well, I don't think so there.

100
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:11,870
While you weren't looking, I got Dwayne to
eat one of the parts.

101
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:16,074
Well, I guess when I scare up my tin snips,
I'm going to have to scare that part up too.

102
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:18,177
Got it.

103
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:28,086
My friend had a sliver in the back of his
arm.

104
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:32,925
It was big and huge and

105
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:36,628
Looked like it could cause them a great deal
of discomfort in some future time.

106
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:41,300
So I took my needle and vice grips and a
bottle opener.

107
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:46,505
I proceeded to remove the sliver with the
occasional break for refreshments.

108
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:49,942
Well, I dug

109
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,410
Away at it for an hour or two.

110
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:57,449
Can you imagine my embarrassment when my
friend pointed out that it was actually a

111
00:06:57,449 --> 00:06:58,016
tattoo

112
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:13,332
put down?

113
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:21,973
This week on the

114
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:26,678
Handyman corner, I'm going to show you how to
change your oil or more specifically, how to

115
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:27,813
change the oil on your car.

116
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,151
That's something that you have to do every
couple of years and darned inconvenient.

117
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:35,954
Plastic can cost upwards of 15 bucks.

118
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:40,425
Besides, when you get it done at a gas
station or whatever it, you're just not sure

119
00:07:40,425 --> 00:07:43,595
whether or not they've done a bad job, you
know, whereas if you do it yourself, you

120
00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:48,467
know, OK, the first thing you're going to
need is something to catch the oil with when

121
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:51,736
you're taking your old oil out. I like to
use one of these foil roasting pans.

122
00:07:51,736 --> 00:07:55,974
This is when I used to cook a turkey and
last night in the microwave oven, which is

123
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:58,944
actually created another handyman corner for
us later in the season.

124
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:00,846
How to fix your microwave.

125
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,516
Next thing you need is an adjustable wrench.

126
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:09,187
This is to loosen the nut drain plug on the
bottom of the oil pan.

127
00:08:09,454 --> 00:08:11,823
And this is another handy little item here
that I like.

128
00:08:11,823 --> 00:08:15,660
It's a creeper. It's got the wheels on the
bottom and use that to lie down on and roll

129
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:21,633
yourself under the vehicle. So what the
great friend plays guitar fan got a wrench.

130
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:25,904
And honey, we go, Oh, OK.

131
00:08:26,037 --> 00:08:27,038
All right. Here you go.

132
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:35,146
Oh, OK, how many of you handy man noticed my
little trick there?

133
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:37,649
I on purpose now I.

134
00:08:38,016 --> 00:08:39,150
I forgot to raise the jack.

135
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,252
I pretended. I forgot.

136
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:41,519
That's it. I pretend. Yeah, that's it.

137
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,056
Yeah, OK, so you go around to the jack
because you've got to raise the car up to get

138
00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:46,791
under it. You know, any idiot knows that.

139
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:49,694
It's obvious that Jack to raise.

140
00:08:49,694 --> 00:08:54,799
It's like going to your boss and saying, Hey
Jack, how about a raise up children?

141
00:08:59,804 --> 00:09:07,445
Oh boy, oh OK, I may need a longer jack.

142
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:11,116
Oh by golly.

143
00:09:19,357 --> 00:09:25,130
So if the mountain won't come to Mohammed,
get yourself one of these engine arm lift and

144
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,865
change engine one of these things.

145
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:36,808
So she goes out of power here, a lot of
power.

146
00:09:41,813 --> 00:09:45,617
Hmm. All right.

147
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:51,923
What's happening here is that the is coming
up with the engine because because the engine

148
00:09:51,923 --> 00:09:54,793
motor mounts are still done up because you
have to undo them from underneath, which we

149
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:56,728
can't get underneath because we can't jack
the car up.

150
00:09:56,961 --> 00:09:58,563
So we're back to square one.

151
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:05,937
So we have to revert to the laws of physics,
which is if we can't get the engine to come

152
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:08,773
up, we can get the car to go down.

153
00:10:19,217 --> 00:10:27,659
She went a little bit. Ok, now the reason
the engine was so heavy was that we didn't

154
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,596
bother with the time consuming job of
removing the transmission.

155
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:35,366
So now what we can do is just take out the
drain plug.

156
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:40,371
Let me get the get our little pan here to
catch the and we're going to get the old oil

157
00:10:40,371 --> 00:10:41,005
out over here.

158
00:10:43,374 --> 00:10:46,044
Hey, you know.

159
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,712
Yeah, yeah. Mm hmm.

160
00:10:47,712 --> 00:10:49,247
Mm hmm. Mm hmm. To come.

161
00:10:49,447 --> 00:10:50,114
Yeah. Yeah.

162
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:57,088
Ok. That's got her well.

163
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:01,025
She was definitely ready for a change, huh?

164
00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:07,365
Take that up again. And now we can put the
new oil back in.

165
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:14,706
I say new oil, but it's actually just the
oil I took out of the out of the thing last

166
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:22,914
time I did the oil change, OK, 2010 and put
it right in here, I could spill any there.

167
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:38,496
And that's basically it for doing your oil
change, so that Temple

168
00:11:39,497 --> 00:11:40,531
Feel a little bit there. Ok.

169
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:49,340
All right. And that's it.

170
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,743
So until next time, remember the women don't
find you handsome.

171
00:11:52,877 --> 00:11:54,045
You should at least find your handy.

172
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:01,385
Now here, you

173
00:12:04,188 --> 00:12:13,865
Can take a bit more. His

174
00:12:13,865 --> 00:12:16,434
autumn hunting season opens today.

175
00:12:16,968 --> 00:12:18,769
Some say hunting isn't a sport.

176
00:12:19,136 --> 00:12:20,338
We have guns.

177
00:12:20,371 --> 00:12:24,075
The animals have nothing, but we know how to
even up the odds.

178
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:25,910
We give ourselves a handicap.

179
00:12:26,477 --> 00:12:36,454
It's called beer. Wow, this water pump thing
is causing a

180
00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:37,521
real stir around here.

181
00:12:37,755 --> 00:12:42,727
Douglas says we can't afford a new pump, but
the old ones held together with string and

182
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:45,696
chewing gum, which actually fluoridated the
water somehow.

183
00:12:46,263 --> 00:12:50,001
But Buster Hatfield, an old man, Sedgwick,
they want to go back to the way things were

184
00:12:50,001 --> 00:12:52,203
with no water system, no telephone, no
electricity.

185
00:12:53,437 --> 00:12:54,972
Well, what am I supposed to do?

186
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:56,640
Playing Nintendo by candlelight?

187
00:12:56,941 --> 00:12:57,875
No thank you.

188
00:12:58,743 --> 00:13:01,879
You don't hear the simpler things are, the
less there is to go wrong.

189
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,848
At least that's the rule.

190
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:04,915
You're the exception.

191
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,887
Personally, I think we should let a helmet
go ahead and try and fix the pump because

192
00:13:10,087 --> 00:13:11,255
he's got his mind set on it.

193
00:13:11,555 --> 00:13:14,692
And I don't really want to argue with
anybody who's larger than my van.

194
00:13:15,426 --> 00:13:19,163
You know, Uncle Red, I was down at Murray's
store and he says he'll sell us like a water

195
00:13:19,163 --> 00:13:20,698
pump. That's the service plan and a
warranty.

196
00:13:21,465 --> 00:13:23,734
Well, does it include life insurance for you?

197
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:27,171
Why would I need that? Because you're the
one who would have to tell helmet.

198
00:13:27,605 --> 00:13:29,640
No, no.

199
00:13:29,673 --> 00:13:31,242
You send somebody that nobody likes to do
that.

200
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:38,616
Murray. That's the one you're looking pretty
good there.

201
00:13:39,316 --> 00:13:42,319
Oh, hello, Red Hill.

202
00:13:43,454 --> 00:13:45,156
Just trying to keep the resale value up.

203
00:13:45,556 --> 00:13:47,158
I'm not that I'd ever sell her.

204
00:13:47,191 --> 00:13:48,592
No, no, no, no, no.

205
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:50,828
When's the last time you whacked your van?

206
00:13:51,662 --> 00:13:53,531
Well, I run into a beehive one time.

207
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,769
Well, it's a pride thing read, I take great
pride

208
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:02,239
In my car. Well, that's tough to do with an
ass.

209
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:06,110
It's not a nash, it's a gremlin.

210
00:14:07,077 --> 00:14:08,712
Is that your idea of a joke?

211
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,649
No, I think this is Detroit's idea of a joke.

212
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:17,421
I'm not about to argue taste in cars with a
man whose truck is painted like a 20 foot

213
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:17,788
drunk.

214
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:22,893
Well, actually, I guess I'm just here to talk
to you about the new water pump, how much

215
00:14:22,893 --> 00:14:24,295
money we got in the launch kitty.

216
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:32,336
I'm not telling you. And the reason I have a
Treasury is because I don't let anybody know

217
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:33,470
how much is in there.

218
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:37,107
That's what makes me the best treasure this
lodge has ever had.

219
00:14:37,741 --> 00:14:40,611
So it's under a hundred dollars way under.

220
00:14:41,945 --> 00:14:45,416
Well, it doesn't matter whether we repair
the pump or replace it, we can't afford to do

221
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,016
either one,

222
00:14:46,316 --> 00:14:47,584
Not from the kitty.

223
00:14:48,619 --> 00:14:51,522
Well, we're not going to worry about money
right now because it's time for adventures

224
00:14:51,522 --> 00:14:53,757
with Bill. You don't worry about money.

225
00:14:53,757 --> 00:14:55,626
Was Bill Weir or worry about

226
00:14:56,026 --> 00:14:57,294
Personal injury now?

227
00:14:59,096 --> 00:15:03,801
Well, you get you get the idea, but I've got
a sense of possum arena there, and he writes

228
00:15:06,036 --> 00:15:09,740
Franson garbage cans with them, and I wasn't
quite sure what he had in mind.

229
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:12,543
I wanted to line these up and I thought I
was going to play.

230
00:15:12,676 --> 00:15:14,711
Where's the pea under the under the carpet?

231
00:15:15,345 --> 00:15:20,017
Oh, OK, Bill.

232
00:15:20,117 --> 00:15:21,385
Bill, get your head out of there, bill.

233
00:15:22,152 --> 00:15:27,191
Yeah. Then I'll play recipe under the can or
the head of the cannon.

234
00:15:27,357 --> 00:15:28,559
Well, anyway, he knows.

235
00:15:29,426 --> 00:15:33,864
Sure. I'm not sure Bill is familiar with how
slippery ice can get when it's golden.

236
00:15:34,464 --> 00:15:35,966
Anyway, you got them all lined up there.

237
00:15:35,966 --> 00:15:38,168
And then he tried to explain to me what he
was going to do.

238
00:15:38,268 --> 00:15:40,971
He he reached into one of the barrels, pulls
out his skates.

239
00:15:41,238 --> 00:15:42,272
So this was a clue.

240
00:15:43,006 --> 00:15:48,879
And he is going to come along and then I'll
leap into the air.

241
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:52,649
He's going to leap into the air. And so this
is basically your barrel, jump in your

242
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:53,750
Olympic barrel jumping.

243
00:15:53,884 --> 00:15:57,154
And I was going to wave to something, make
him go, and he's pretty excited about it.

244
00:15:58,789 --> 00:16:00,224
But then he's a natural athlete.

245
00:16:01,825 --> 00:16:05,696
So he went up, got a skates on, and I just
sort of stood by the barrel with the flag at

246
00:16:05,696 --> 00:16:07,064
the ready waiting for my cue.

247
00:16:07,831 --> 00:16:11,034
And now you look a little a little a little
better with the skates on.

248
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:13,170
So I figured, Well,

249
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:15,539
All right, let's let them go.

250
00:16:17,074 --> 00:16:18,408
He's he's back up again.

251
00:16:18,442 --> 00:16:22,212
He's all right. It's either this or, I
guess, are his warm up exercises.

252
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:26,817
Kind of unusual, but then builds up kind of
guy, isn't he?

253
00:16:27,484 --> 00:16:30,954
And this was really not working out so well.

254
00:16:30,954 --> 00:16:33,090
So Bill had another plan.

255
00:16:34,825 --> 00:16:36,093
Now he tried shoes and tried.

256
00:16:36,793 --> 00:16:43,367
This is different. Cross Country, I believe
those are cross country barrel jumping up and

257
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:43,767
comes on.

258
00:16:43,767 --> 00:16:45,235
Get the heck out of there.

259
00:16:45,235 --> 00:16:46,737
He's in the air flying.

260
00:16:47,037 --> 00:16:47,904
Oh my god.

261
00:16:50,006 --> 00:16:51,441
Oh, oh, oh.

262
00:16:53,377 --> 00:16:53,643
Oh.

263
00:16:57,414 --> 00:16:58,515
Oh, there he is, there he is.

264
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:05,155
He seems all right. All I got to do now is
get him up at the end of the driveway by

265
00:17:05,155 --> 00:17:05,689
Tuesday.

266
00:17:19,102 --> 00:17:24,441
Well, now everybody's getting involved in
this water pump crisis, busters designed kind

267
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:27,110
of a manual system actually for bringing
water up from the lake.

268
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:32,282
He got the idea from the movie Swiss family
Robinson, which just opened at the theater in

269
00:17:32,282 --> 00:17:34,384
town. It's on a double bill with pillow
talk.

270
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:39,089
All that means is seven bathtubs and a three
inch thick clothesline.

271
00:17:39,556 --> 00:17:45,362
The clothesline we have now, Douglas, that
the treasurer is, you know, he wants us all

272
00:17:45,362 --> 00:17:47,397
to just dig ourselves a new well.

273
00:17:47,564 --> 00:17:51,768
Well, we tried that before we ended up with
just a big open pit mine and that eventually

274
00:17:51,768 --> 00:17:54,170
flooded and that's how we got the big bay up
at the North End.

275
00:17:54,804 --> 00:17:56,406
In fact, for sure, like the Big Bang.

276
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:57,574
Really? Are you sure?

277
00:17:58,441 --> 00:17:59,576
Sure. As I'm standing here.

278
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:05,282
Oh, no helmet thought he had the the water
pump fixed, you know?

279
00:18:05,315 --> 00:18:10,387
But unfortunately he plugged it in and now
we need a new pump and a new fuse box.

280
00:18:11,454 --> 00:18:14,391
Anything hurt except his pride and of
course, all of our aluminum wiring.

281
00:18:15,692 --> 00:18:19,529
But the unfortunate thing here is the helmet
is now taking that pump thing as a personal

282
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:23,366
issue, and that's bad. The last time helmet
took something personally, we ended up having

283
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:24,934
to reforest over 100 hundred acres.

284
00:18:25,535 --> 00:18:28,171
You know, I don't think we can rule out
Murray's plan, either.

285
00:18:28,204 --> 00:18:31,608
You know, he has a very impressive proposal
for tonight's meeting.

286
00:18:31,775 --> 00:18:34,077
Oh, I helped him with the graphics.

287
00:18:34,577 --> 00:18:36,846
All right. Well, that's it.

288
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,748
That's it. Well, it's time for the meeting.

289
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:42,185
D-day. Oh, to pump or not to pump.

290
00:18:42,218 --> 00:18:43,686
That is the pulsating question.

291
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,522
Oh, it's a meeting.

292
00:18:45,822 --> 00:18:47,190
Let's go. Let's go.

293
00:18:48,358 --> 00:18:50,460
Well, I'll be right back this.

294
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,494
This won't take too long.

295
00:18:51,494 --> 00:18:54,864
We're definitely not dealing with an
unlimited attention span down there.

296
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:05,642
All right. All right.

297
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:14,617
Everybody going to see here, you get so
cranky and irritable and hi, everybody else

298
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:21,090
stand up. Well,

299
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,832
now. The floor recognizes helmet Whitaker.

300
00:19:29,866 --> 00:19:31,968
Thank you, red. I'm happy to announce to
everybody

301
00:19:33,036 --> 00:19:34,571
I have fixed the pump.

302
00:19:37,207 --> 00:19:41,377
Well, now don't bother billing us because
there's no money to pay for it.

303
00:19:41,477 --> 00:19:42,712
Oh, Douglas,

304
00:19:42,712 --> 00:19:46,649
The last thing we need when the world is in
trouble is an accountant, a billionaire.

305
00:19:46,683 --> 00:19:49,152
Nine Scrounged up every part for free.

306
00:19:49,852 --> 00:19:52,322
Mind you, you're going to have a little
trouble starting your nashe.

307
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:54,324
Filthy mix.

308
00:19:54,324 --> 00:19:55,525
Touch my gremlin.

309
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:57,126
Oh, hang on. Hang on.

310
00:19:57,126 --> 00:19:58,828
Let's remember Bill and helmet.

311
00:19:58,828 --> 00:20:01,197
Fix this. It's not going to work.

312
00:20:02,498 --> 00:20:03,933
That's an excellent point.

313
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,101
I second that.

314
00:20:05,401 --> 00:20:06,536
Yeah, shut up, Dwayne.

315
00:20:07,136 --> 00:20:09,138
I was a cruel and heartless thing to say.

316
00:20:09,172 --> 00:20:10,807
Well, isn't it, Marie? Shut up, Harold.

317
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,509
Ok, let's shut up, Murray.

318
00:20:13,576 --> 00:20:14,711
Bill, fire up the pump.

319
00:20:20,817 --> 00:20:23,086
You know it up.

320
00:20:27,056 --> 00:20:32,195
Well, I'm sure it'll turn on eventually, but
while we're waiting, I think I have something

321
00:20:32,195 --> 00:20:34,197
that might interest all of you, Dwayne.

322
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,832
Oh, thanks.

323
00:20:36,032 --> 00:20:38,167
No one's ever called me interesting before.

324
00:20:38,568 --> 00:20:42,138
Maybe it's my haircut or the fact that I
have that drawing Dwayne.

325
00:20:42,505 --> 00:20:48,044
Oh. Now, while we were arguing over whether
we should fix the pump or replace it, I

326
00:20:48,044 --> 00:20:51,814
couldn't help get the feeling that, well, we
just weren't thinking big enough.

327
00:20:53,316 --> 00:21:01,958
Well, so I decided we should invest in a big
water turbine and put it in this Dwayne.

328
00:21:02,358 --> 00:21:03,793
What the drawing.

329
00:21:03,993 --> 00:21:11,400
Oh yeah. Murray's water theme park, a water
theme park as Dwayne has so wonderfully

330
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,370
pre-empted Murray's wild and woolly water
wonderland.

331
00:21:15,304 --> 00:21:17,440
I wanted to call it Dwayne's wet spot.

332
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,775
Now, wait a minute. We can't afford that.

333
00:21:19,775 --> 00:21:21,477
We can't even afford this drawing.

334
00:21:21,511 --> 00:21:23,346
The place is a gold mine.

335
00:21:23,446 --> 00:21:28,251
Oh, it'll be a magnet for tourists will
recruit new members and oh well, we will get

336
00:21:28,251 --> 00:21:29,619
a lot of media attention.

337
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:30,453
Let me tell you.

338
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,623
Hold on a minute here, Murray.

339
00:21:34,257 --> 00:21:36,559
That's going to bring a lot of families up
to the lodge.

340
00:21:37,126 --> 00:21:38,494
They don't need that sort of thing.

341
00:21:38,828 --> 00:21:41,764
No. Forget the last family here.

342
00:21:42,898 --> 00:21:46,068
Think what we have to do is a whole bunch of
us have just got to do a little bit of

343
00:21:46,068 --> 00:21:47,403
thinking here for a minute or two.

344
00:21:48,271 --> 00:21:49,038
Some other brilliant

345
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:51,574
Ideas. Oh no, you realize what you're asking
here.

346
00:21:52,341 --> 00:21:53,409
Look. Think about it.

347
00:21:53,409 --> 00:21:57,847
I don't like this anymore than you do, but
I'm sure if we all put our minds together,

348
00:21:57,847 --> 00:21:58,914
something good will happen.

349
00:21:59,482 --> 00:22:00,950
Someone's going to get along.

350
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:10,326
Well, okay, so let's get to that.

351
00:22:12,695 --> 00:22:15,231
Oh, oh no.

352
00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:22,805
Well, I think this is a perfect example of
water water everywhere and not a thought to

353
00:22:22,805 --> 00:22:28,277
think. I don't know how religious you are,
but if there is a greater power at work here,

354
00:22:28,377 --> 00:22:31,747
neither has a very unusual sense of humor or
way too much time on his hands.

355
00:22:32,615 --> 00:22:36,485
Anyway, if my wife is watching, I'll be
coming straight home after the meeting and

356
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:37,987
I'm feeling lucky tonight.

357
00:22:37,987 --> 00:22:39,455
So why don't you leave the television on?

358
00:22:40,856 --> 00:22:45,127
So next time I'll be asking myself, Harold
and the whole gang up here at Possum Lodge.

359
00:22:45,494 --> 00:22:46,562
Keep your stick on the ice.

360
00:22:53,936 --> 00:23:01,043
No, oh, no, oh no.

361
00:23:03,145 --> 00:23:07,883
And. Oh, I know, I know this.

362
00:23:08,317 --> 00:23:09,919
Oh my God.

363
00:23:10,786 --> 00:23:11,353
I got it.
