1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:04,404
IT’S THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW!

2
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:09,342
HERE'S THE MAN WITH A FIRM
GRASP ON THE BOAT AND DOCK --

3
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:13,613
THAT GREAT CAST-OFF,
MY UNCLE, YOUR HERO, RED GREEN!

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,482
(Applause and cheering)

5
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:16,916
APPRECIATE IT.

6
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:18,551
THANK YOU, HAROLD.

7
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:20,153
YOU'RE THE MAN!

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,288
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

9
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,490
I WAS HOPING TO GET

10
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:24,824
INTO A NEW PROJECT.

11
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,926
I GOT SOME GOVERNMENT PAPERWORK

12
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:28,428
THAT I GOTTA CLEAR UP.

13
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,597
ABOUT YOUR MISSING
BIRTH CERTIFICATE?

14
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:32,465
THEY FOUND
THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS.

15
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,601
(Audience laughing)

16
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:36,903
NO, HAROLD, COME OFF IT.

17
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,039
THE LODGE IS ON LEASED LAND.

18
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:40,507
WE'VE HAD THE LEASE

19
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:42,575
FOR 99 YEARS, BUT SHE'S UP.

20
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:45,178
THEY'RE GONNA RAISE
OUR RENT 500%.

21
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:46,913
500%?!
YES, SIR.

22
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,281
THAT'S RIDICULOUS!

23
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:51,518
THEY CAN'T
DO THAT!
THEY DID IT.

24
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,987
THEY GOT US UP TO FIVE BUCKS.

25
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,456
FIVE BUCKS
FOR 100 YEARS?

26
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:57,757
DON'T I WISH!

27
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:00,660
IT'S FIVE BUCKS FOR 99 YEARS.

28
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,162
IT WAS GONNA BE

29
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:05,398
THREE BUCKS, BUT
OLD MAN SEDGWICK TALKED TO THEM

30
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,666
AND NOW IT'S FIVE.

31
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,368
WELL, REALLY,
FIVE BUCKS

32
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,003
ISN'T TOO BAD.

33
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,337
DO YOU HAVE

34
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,906
YOUR WALLET
ON YOU?

35
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:14,240
NO, NO, NO!

36
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:16,910
NO, NO, NO, NOT MY MONEY --
YOUR MONEY.

37
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:20,613
YOU WANT TO RAISE IT, THEN
YOU CAN RETURN YOUR EMPTIES.

38
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,782
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

39
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:25,485
WE WEREN'T DRINKING --
WE WERE INVESTING.

40
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:31,825
(Horns honking)

41
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:34,427
(Geese honking)

42
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,931
(Quacking)

43
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,403
(Red): YOU'RE LOOKIN'
AT SEGMENTS

44
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,171
FROM THIS PARTICULAR SHOW,

45
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:46,573
THE MAIN MESSAGE BEING,

46
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:49,209
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT CHANGING THE CHANNEL.

47
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,878
TO MAKE SENSE
OUT OF THIS PROGRAMME,

48
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,213
YOU GOTTA GIVE IT

49
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,948
YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.

50
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,557
HAROLD, YOU CAN REST EASY.

51
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,326
CLEARED THE EMPTIES
OUT OF THE STORAGE SHED.

52
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:07,927
WE COVERED THE FIVE BUCKS.

53
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:09,596
EVEN HAD MONEY
LEFT OVER.

54
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:10,964
HOW MUCH LEFT OVER?

55
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,233
783 BUCKS.

56
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,567
WOW.

57
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:17,470
THAT'S A LOT.

58
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,538
YOU SHOULD SEE
HOW MUCH ROOM

59
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,540
WE GOT IN THAT STORAGE SHED.

60
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,976
WE SHOULD USE THAT
TO STORE STUFF.

61
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,178
DID YOU READ
THIS ENTIRE LETTER?

62
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:28,381
THAT'S A GOVERNMENT LETTER --
YOU DON'T READ THOSE.

63
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:31,351
YOU LOOK AT THE BOX
SAYS HOW MUCH MONEY YOU OWE.

64
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,387
IT SAYS, IN THE MIDDLE, THAT
YOU GOTTA MAKE A PRESENTATION.

65
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:36,556
WHAT?!
YOU GOTTA
MAKE A SPEECH

66
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,424
TO A COMMITTEE
AND CONVINCE THEM

67
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,260
THAT THE LEASE
SHOULD BE RENEWED.

68
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,663
THEN THE COMMITTEE DECIDES
WHICH ORGANIZATION WILL GET IT.

69
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,566
HAROLD, WHO'S COMPETING
WITH US ON THIS?

70
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:47,967
EVERYBODY!

71
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:51,104
THE ROTARIANS,
THE POSSUM LAKE CANOE CLUB,

72
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:54,274
THE VINTAGE CAR CLUB,
THE GIRL SCOUTS...

73
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:58,344
THERE'S EVEN A MOTORCYCLE CLUB,
SATAN'S SECOND CHOICE.

74
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,213
THEY CAN'T
DO THIS!

75
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,481
THIS IS
OUR SPOT!

76
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,183
YOU SAID YOU LIKE COMPETITION.

77
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,651
THIS IS JUST COMPETITION.

78
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:05,752
I ONLY LIKE COMPETITION
WHEN I WIN!

79
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:08,655
(Audience laughing)

80
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,858
(Red): LATER ON,
IN "ADVENTURES WITH BILL",

81
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,860
GONNA DO SOME WATER-SKIING.

82
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,962
GETTING READY
AND STARTING UP...

83
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,363
THAT MOTOR DOES NOT--

84
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,532
IT'S GOT THE OLD HAND-PULL.

85
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,001
I DIDN'T REALIZE THE SKI ROPE
WAS ACROSS

86
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,771
THE PULLER, AND
BILL SET THE HANDLE DOWN

87
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:28,341
AND APPARENTLY HOOKED IT
ONTO A ROCK

88
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,143
AND, WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT,

89
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,611
THERE GOES THE MOTOR!

90
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:34,814
UNFORTUNATELY, THE SKI ROPE
STARTED WINDING AROUND

91
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:36,282
AND STARTED PULLING ME

92
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,885
A LITTLE--
YEAH, MM-HMM, YEAH, YEAH.

93
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,220
ALL RIGHTY.

94
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,989
SO, UH, WE'LL THINK
OF SOMETHING ELSE.

95
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,358
OHHH! OHHH!

96
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,493
WE'LL GET A PLAN "B"-- OHHH!

97
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:50,496
AND WE'LL GET RIGHT ON THAT.

98
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,065
MMM!

99
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:58,004
OHHH, SHE WAS A CEDAR-STRIP
CRUISING YACHT

100
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,139
THE NICEST BOAT
I EVER BOUGHT

101
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:03,643
NOT CONCERNED WITH
HOW MY HEART WOULD BREAK

102
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,378
SHE'S GONE
BUT NOT FORGOTTEN

103
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,647
SHE WAS A GOOD BOAT
BUT TOTALLY ROTTEN

104
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:08,948
MY LOVE IS DEEP

105
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,217
UNFORTUNATELY,
SO IS THE LAKE

106
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,222
THIS IS FOR THE BIG ONE!

107
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:18,324
THE GRAND PRIZE OF A SET
OF MINIATURE LAWN DARTS

108
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,460
FROM WANG FU'S
ACUPUNCTURE CENTRE.

109
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,263
UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS

110
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,465
TO MAKE MR. BUZZ SHERWOOD
SAY THIS WORD.

111
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,799
BUZZ.
OH!

112
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,302
THE WORD IS...

113
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,304
HA-HA! WA-HAHHH...

114
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,805
(Audience laughing)

115
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,308
AHHHH... NUDIST!

116
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,809
(Giggling)

117
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,378
ALL RIGHT, BUZZ.

118
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,681
SOMEONE
WHO IS NAKED

119
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,950
IS...
... FUN!

120
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,985
NO, NO, NO.

121
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,588
IF A WOMAN DOESN'T BELIEVE
IN WEARING CLOTHES,

122
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,223
YOU WOULD CALL HER A...

123
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,225
... A LOT!

124
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,826
(Audience laughing)

125
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,228
OK, NO, NO.

126
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,163
THIS IS THE NAME OF SOMEONE
WHO DOESN'T WEAR CLOTHES.

127
00:04:57,163 --> 00:05:00,633
OH, SUSAN.

128
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,502
NO, NO, MORE THAN ONE PERSON.

129
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:05,104
THE MURPHY SISTERS?

130
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,740
I'M LOOKING FOR
A GENERIC WORD, HERE.

131
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,909
A MAN OR WOMAN
WHO DOESN'T WEAR CLOTHES.

132
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,078
OH, LIKE THAT
DONALD GUY!

133
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,714
WHAT'S HE GOT,
ANYWAY?

134
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:17,583
WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME.

135
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,520
THESE PEOPLE GO AROUND
IN THE BUFF.

136
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,522
NUNS!

137
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,291
I THINK THAT'S TIME --
WE'RE OUT OF TIME.

138
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,893
THANKS FOR PLAYING.

139
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,828
NUNS GO AROUND IN THE BUFF?

140
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,431
OH, I THOUGHT YOU SAID "BUS"!

141
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:34,500
(Audience laughing)

142
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,903
THIS WEEK ON "HANDYMAN CORNER",

143
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,604
WE'LL DO A PROJECT
THAT SHOWS YOU

144
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,973
HOW TO MAKE DO
WITH WHAT YOU HAVE.

145
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:43,609
I HAVE A LEAKY ROOF.

146
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,779
MANY PEOPLE
WOULD TRY AND FIX THAT.

147
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:47,814
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY THINK

148
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:48,481
THE ROOF WILL HOLD
THEIR WEIGHT.

149
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,450
I KNOW BETTER.

150
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,086
INSTEAD, I'M GONNA MAKE
HOME-MADE BEER.

151
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,388
THEN I WON'T CARE
IF IT'S RAINING.

152
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,558
WATER IS THE BIG INGREDIENT
WHEN YOU'RE MAKING BEER,

153
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,127
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE MAKING
AMERICAN BEER.

154
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,364
SO... WITH THE WATER COMING
DOWN THROUGH THE ROOF,

155
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,433
IT REALLY ADDS TO THE FLAVOUR
OF THE BEER

156
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,601
AND IT HELPS ME GIVE IT A NAME.

157
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,539
SHE'S COMIN' OFF A BIG CEDAR LOG

158
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,576
SO I'LL CALL MY BEER
"BIG CEDAR LAGER...

159
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,546
"THE WOODSMAN'S BEER
THAT MAKES YOU CUT AND SPLIT."

160
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,148
THIRSTY YET?

161
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,950
(Thunder)

162
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,386
THE NEXT THING YOU NEED IS

163
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,321
SOMETHING THEY CALL
"BITTERING HOPS".

164
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,456
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT IS,

165
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,425
SO I ASKED THE GUYS
AT THE LODGE

166
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,694
AND AFTER FIVE HOURS,
IT BECAME CLEAR

167
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,463
THEY HAD NO IDEA, EITHER,
WHICH IS AMAZING,

168
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,366
CONSIDERING THEIR FAMILIARITY
WITH THE FINAL PRODUCT.

169
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,468
I DECIDED TO BREAK HER DOWN.

170
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,737
YOU GOT BITTERING
AND YOU GOT HOPS.

171
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:48,074
I FIGURE... "BITTERING"
HAS GOT TO BE FOR YOUR LEMONS

172
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,511
AND "HOPS" HAS GOTTA BE
RABBIT FOOD.

173
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,814
IT DOESN'T AFFECT
THE ALCOHOL CONTENT

174
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,116
SO IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

175
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,484
FIRE THAT IN THERE

176
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:01,320
AND PUT YOUR WASHING MACHINE
ON TO THE "PRE-WASH",

177
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:04,424
LET THE BITTERING HOPS WORK
FOR A WHILE.

178
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,493
WONDERED WHERE THAT SHIRT WENT.

179
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,098
ALL RIGHT,
ONCE THAT CYCLE'S DONE,

180
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,834
YOU WANT TO ADD MALT EXTRACT.

181
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,838
YOU'RE PROBABLY GUESSING
THIS HERE IS A CHOCOLATE MALT.

182
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:19,872
(Sniffing)

183
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:24,043
AND EARLIER THIS YEAR,
IT PROBABLY WAS.

184
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,078
ALL RIGHT, PUT THAT IN THERE.

185
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,647
THEN YOU START 'ER UP

186
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:31,117
ON WHATEVER CYCLE
SUITS THE BEER YOU'RE MAKING.

187
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,920
FOR ENGLISH BEER,
SET 'ER ON "PERMANENT PRESS".

188
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,656
FOR THE LIGHT BEER,
MAYBE GO "DELICATE".

189
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,925
FOR A BEER THAT DOESN'T
MAKE YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM,

190
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,793
SET 'ER ON "RINSE AND HOLD".

191
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,199
ALL RIGHT, I'M SUPPOSED TO ADD

192
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,034
SOMETHING CALLED
"FINISHING HOPS".

193
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,036
AGAIN, I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THAT IS

194
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:53,573
SO THEY MUST JUST MEAN
THE REST OF THE RABBIT FOOD.

195
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,908
DON'T FORGET.

196
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:59,312
I'M MAKING DO WITH WHAT I HAVE,
PLUS I DON'T CARE.

197
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,748
ALL RIGHT, WHEN THAT'S DONE,
I'M GONNA FILTER THE BEER.

198
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:06,085
I GOTTA STORE IT
SOMEWHERE COLD FOR TWO WEEKS.

199
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,722
THIS IS NOW MY BEER FRIDGE.

200
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,697
I GOT MY PIPES RUNNING IN
THROUGH THE FRIDGE

201
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,098
WHERE I'M GONNA STORE THE BEER.

202
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,734
I GOT 'EM COMING OUT
TO MY BEER TAP

203
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:22,969
FOR DISPENSING THE BEER.

204
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,471
I'VE USED THE MAIN CHAMBER
OF THE FRIDGE

205
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,473
BUT YOU COULD RUN THE PIPES
THROUGH THE FREEZER

206
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,976
IF YOU WERE MAKING AN ICE BEER.

207
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,278
NOW WE COME TO THE MOST
IMPORTANT INGREDIENT

208
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:36,215
WHENEVER YOU'RE MAKING BEER,
AND THAT IS YOUR YEAST.

209
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:40,019
WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T TRY TO MAKE DO.

210
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,655
DON'T TRY TO USE BAKING SODA
OR DISH DETERGENT.

211
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,926
THE YEAST IS
WHAT MAKES IT BEER.

212
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,629
THAT'S WHAT GIVES YOU YOUR
COLOUR, CLARITY, YOUR FLAVOUR,

213
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,732
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
YOUR ALCOHOLIC CONTENT.

214
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,939
(Audience laughing)

215
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:07,179
THERE WE GO.

216
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:10,316
YOU WANT TO IMMEDIATELY
PUMP THE BEER

217
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:14,120
INTO YOUR STORAGE VAT, WHICH,
IN THIS CASE, IS THE FRIDGE.

218
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,390
NOW I NEED SOMETHING
TO MAKE DO AS A FILTER.

219
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,791
OH!

220
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:21,994
THERE, THIS PIECE

221
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,397
OF SHIRT WILL WORK
ABSOLUTELY FINE.

222
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,232
NOW WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS

223
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,268
TAKE THE DRAIN-PUMP
FROM THE WASHING MACHINE

224
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,871
AND JUST PUMP 'ER
RIGHT THROUGH.

225
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,441
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
ACTUALLY CALLED "WART"

226
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:38,411
AND THIS IS CALLED
"TRANSFERRING THE WART".

227
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,745
I WAS GONNA CALL IT
"REMOVING THE WART"

228
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,848
BUT I THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE
THE BEER HARD TO DRINK.

229
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,350
SHE'S LEAKING A LITTLE.

230
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:50,056
WE'VE WAITED THE TWO WEEKS...
OR CLOSE ENOUGH.

231
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,424
FELT LIKE TWO WEEKS.

232
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,327
I'M GUESSING THE BEER
IS READY FOR TASTING.

233
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,063
THE BEAUTY IS,
WE'VE MADE OUR MICRO-BREWERY

234
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,564
RIGHT IN OUR OWN HOME.

235
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:01,934
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

236
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,337
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

237
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,840
AFTER A COUPLE OF BEERS, THEY
MIGHT EVEN FIND YOU HANDSOME.

238
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,709
THE BEAUTY IS,
WE DIDN'T BUY ANYTHING.

239
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,210
WE JUST MADE DO.

240
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:14,547
(Spitting)

241
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,118
OR MAYBE WE MADE DOO-DOO.

242
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:24,123
STAY TUNED -- WHATEVER THIS IS,
WE GOT LOTS MORE OF IT.

243
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,462
WANT TO TALK TO YOU GUYS

244
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,598
ABOUT THOSE 4:00-IN-THE-MORNING
CAN'T-SLEEP THOUGHTS

245
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,333
THAT WANDER INTO YOUR HEAD.

246
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,402
YOU KNOW THOSE THOUGHTS.

247
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,404
SCARY THOUGHTS.

248
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:41,974
THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW PERFECT
LIFE USED TO BE...

249
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,809
BEFORE YOU WERE MARRIED...

250
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,344
BEFORE YOU WERE EMPLOYED...

251
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:48,981
BEFORE YOU WERE IN HOCK
UP TO YOUR EYEBALLS...

252
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:49,715
BACK IN THE DAYS

253
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,951
WHEN YOUR BELT WAS SHORTER
THAN YOUR IN-SEAM...

254
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,053
WHEN GOING TO THE BATHROOM

255
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,489
ONCE BEFORE BEDTIME
WOULD DO 'ER.

256
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,693
YOU'RE LYING THERE,
DREAMING ABOUT STARTING OVER,

257
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,862
GETTING IN SHAPE,
CHANGING YOUR JOB,

258
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,197
BUYING A NEW CAR,
AND MOVING SOMEWHERE

259
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:07,633
WHERE PEOPLE WILL THINK
YOU'RE DANGEROUS.

260
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,235
I KNOW -- AT 4:00 A.M.

261
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:12,772
IT'S EASY TO IMAGINE
THAT YOU'RE ANTONIO BANDERAS.

262
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,641
THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU CAN'T SEE THE MIRROR.

263
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,176
LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.

264
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:21,147
YOUR STOMACH'S FULL,
YOU'RE WARM, YOU'RE LYING DOWN.

265
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:24,617
WHY WOULD YOU GIVE THAT UP TO
ROLL OVER AND TELL THE MISSUS

266
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,553
THAT YOU'RE LEAVING TO GO OUT
AND START A GARAGE BAND?

267
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,757
DON'T DO IT --
JUST COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS.

268
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:35,127
YOU GOT MOST OF YOUR HEALTH,
SOME OF YOUR MORTGAGE PAID OFF,

269
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,663
AND THE SEMI-RESPECT
OF SOME OF YOUR FRIENDS.

270
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,133
THAT'S GOING TO LOOK GOOD
IN THE MORNING,

271
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,668
EVEN IF YOU DON'T.

272
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:45,004
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

273
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,106
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

274
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:50,276
(Applause)

275
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,345
WELL, EVERYTHING
IS TOTALLY UNDER CONTROL.

276
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:54,046
IN A FEW HOURS,

277
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,483
I'M GONNA HAVE THAT COMMITTEE
EATING OUT OF MY HAND.

278
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,119
YOUR SPEECH
WILL IMPRESS THEM?

279
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,487
NOT SO MUCH THE SPEECH.

280
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,390
IT'S SLAMMING THE COMPETITION,
IS WHAT IT'S DOING...

281
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,059
ESPECIALLY THOSE GIRL GUIDES
WITH THAT COOKIE SCAM.

282
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,496
NO, NO, UNCLE RED,
RULES FORBID PRESENTERS

283
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,331
FROM CRITICIZING
OTHER CONTENDERS.

284
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:15,367
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

285
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:16,368
BRIBE SOMEBODY OR SOMETHING?

286
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,471
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

287
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:19,371
YOU GOTTA MAKE THE SPEECH

288
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:22,174
AS TO ALL THE GOOD THINGS
ABOUT POSSUM LODGE.

289
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:23,743
WE HAVE GOOD THINGS HERE?

290
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,345
YEAH, WE GOT
LOTS OF GOOD THINGS.

291
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,613
WE GOT, UM...

292
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,115
UH...

293
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:31,617
NO, THAT WAS IN "BAYWATCH".

294
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:34,286
(Audience laughing)

295
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:35,154
I KNOW ONE.

296
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,691
REMEMBER THAT RADIOACTIVE SCARE
WE HAD?

297
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:39,258
THOSE READINGS WERE

298
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,593
WELL WITHIN ACCEPTABLE LEVELS.

299
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,195
THAT'S IT! THAT'S WHAT WE DO!

300
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,197
WE'LL DO WHAT POLITICIANS DO.

301
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:47,166
I CAN'T -- I GOT A CONSCIENCE
AND A BAD BACK.

302
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,236
(Audience laughing)

303
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:53,038
WHAT WE DO... THIS IS SO GOOD,
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

304
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:01,046
(Siren)

305
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:02,081
COME ON,
COME ON!

306
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,582
COME ON,
COME ON!

307
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,484
COME ON,
COME ON!

308
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,086
POSSUM 911 --
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

309
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,954
UH, RED, IT'S DALTON HUMPHREY.

310
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,957
CAN'T HELP YOU THERE --
ANY OTHER PROBLEMS?

311
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,093
(Laughing)

312
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,595
I'M JUST NOT QUITE SURE.

313
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,798
UH, FAMILY'S OUT OF TOWN AND...

314
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,400
I JUST DON'T FEEL SO GOOD.

315
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,369
WHAT IS IT? THE TICKER?

316
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,838
YOU GOT PRESSURE, SHOOTING
PAINS, SLURRED SPEECH?

317
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,239
DO YOU SMELL BURNED TOAST?

318
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,876
NO, I'M STRONG AS A HORSE
BUT, YOU KNOW...

319
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,746
I THINK I MISS MY FAMILY.

320
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,314
OH, BOY,
DALTON.

321
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,216
YEAH, WEIRD, HUH?

322
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,451
I COULDN'T WAIT
FOR THEM TO LEAVE

323
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:40,419
AND NOW, I MEAN...

324
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:41,053
WELL, I'M EMBARRASSED

325
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,389
TO BRING IT UP
BUT I FEEL BAD, RED.

326
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,758
THEY'VE ONLY BEEN GONE
A DAY OR TWO AND I...

327
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,494
I GUESS IT'S BEEN FOUR DAYS.

328
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:50,563
WHAT IS THE DATE TODAY?

329
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:51,831
THE 14th.

330
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,966
OK, THEY'VE BEEN GONE
TWO WEEKS, BUT, UH...

331
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,637
I THINK I MIGHT BE
A LITTLE BIT LONELY.

332
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,506
OK, OK, TAKE IT EASY, DALTON.

333
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,474
WE'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE.

334
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:05,044
JUST RELAX -- I'M GONNA PUT
HAROLD ON THE LINE.

335
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,780
TELL DALTON
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.

336
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,516
OK, LAST NIGHT,
I WAS WATCHING T.V.

337
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,585
I SPILLED POP
ALL OVER THE COUCH.

338
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:15,254
I WAS EATING POTATO CHIPS
AT THE SAME TIME.

339
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,455
THIS SYRUP GOT
ALL OVER THE COUCH.

340
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,924
THE CHIP CRUMBS GOT STUCK
IN THERE, TOO.

341
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:21,327
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, HAROLD!

342
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:24,263
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU,
NO POP ON THE COUCH!

343
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:27,099
IF YOU'RE EATING CHIPS,
CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF!

344
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:30,135
YOU KNOW WHAT IT COSTS
TO HAVE A COUCH CLEANED?

345
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,604
THAT HELP,
DALTON?

346
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,106
PERFECT, RED --
THAT'S JUST THE FIX I NEEDED.

347
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,608
(Audience laughing)

348
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,945
(Red): HERE WE ARE
WITH PLAN "B" ON WATER-SKIING.

349
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,514
YEAH, ALL RIGHT, BILL --
SO HE'S, UH...

350
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,783
HE'S POINTING AWAY
FROM THE WATER.

351
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:48,721
I GOT THE ROPE HOOKED
AROUND THE OLD POSSUM VAN.

352
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,690
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY THAT MOTHER
IS THE INVENTION OF...

353
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,125
UH... THERE'S AN EXPRESSION

354
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,895
OF SOME KIND THERE --
AWAY WE GO.

355
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,031
WOW, LOOK AT THAT, EH?

356
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,933
DON'T YOU KIDS TRY THIS.

357
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,801
YOU COULD HARDLY GET THE VAN
INTO YOUR HOME.

358
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,436
LOOK -- ISN'T THAT GREAT?

359
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,105
CYPRESS GARDENS,
INCLUDING THE GARDENS.

360
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,907
YOU DON'T SEE THAT EVERY DAY.

361
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,642
LOOK AT HIM, RIPPING ALONG.

362
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:13,412
I THOUGHT HE MIGHT SLALOM
BUT BILL'S SUCH A CHICKEN.

363
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,214
WHERE I MADE THE MISTAKE

364
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,149
WAS LOOKING BACK ALL THE TIME

365
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,218
AND THEN-- OHHH! BY GOLLY!

366
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,552
(Laughing)

367
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,521
NOW THERE'S NOBODY DRIVING

368
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:23,856
THE VAN, BILL!

369
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,224
YOU GOT NO DRIVER!

370
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,759
YOU MIGHT WANT TO JUST...

371
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,427
YOU MIGHT WANT TO STOP.

372
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,062
ALL RIGHT, GOOD, GOOD.

373
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:33,799
I WOULD WORK ON THE BRAKING...
THE BRAKING ASPECT.

374
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,001
WANT TO GO AGAIN, LITTLE BOY?

375
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,804
ONLY THIS TIME,
THERE'S A DOOR CHARGE.

376
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,306
OH, YOU'RE FINE.

377
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,807
YEAH!

378
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:44,310
YOU GOTTA RETURN THOSE SKIS.

379
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,079
A VIEWER SENT
RED GREEN WORK SOCKS,

380
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,882
AS IF YOU'D SEE "RED GREEN" AND
"WORK" IN THE SAME SENTENCE.

381
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:55,254
I'VE BEEN WORKING
ON MY PRESENTATION.

382
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,356
THAT COMMITTEE'S
GONNA BE IMPRESSED.

383
00:15:57,356 --> 00:16:00,125
LOOK AT THIS -- THE FUTURE SITE

384
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,628
OF THE POSSUM LODGE
WATERFRONT AREA, HUH?

385
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,596
HOW MANY COOKIES WILL THOSE
GIRL SCOUTS HAVE TO SELL

386
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:05,531
TO BUILD THIS BABY?

387
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,333
(Laughing)

388
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,668
UNCLE RED, IT'S A TRAVEL POSTER
OF THE CARIBBEAN.

389
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,503
CHECK THE FINE PRINT.

390
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,672
LOOK -- READ THAT --
WHAT DOES THAT SAY?

391
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,307
"ARTIST'S
CONCEPTION".

392
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,242
(Laughing)

393
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,510
I LOVE A LOOP-HOLE!

394
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:20,346
I TOOK YOUR ADVICE.

395
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,815
LOOK AT THIS SPEECH -- I PUT
A POSITIVE SPIN ON EVERYTHING.

396
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,150
I STARTED
WITH AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE.

397
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,386
"METAL RECOVERY PROGRAMME" --
WHAT'S THAT?

398
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,688
EVERY SPRING, WE PULL OUR
SNOWMOBILES OUT OF THE LAKE.

399
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,659
IF YOU CHECK THERE, I ENDED

400
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:37,196
BY POINTING OUT THAT WE'RE
PRESERVING A HERITAGE SITE.

401
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,465
YOU'VE NEVER FIXED ANYTHING
HERE IN YOUR LIFE!

402
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,868
WE'RE KEEPING THIS PLACE IN ITS
ORIGINAL HISTORIC CONDITION.

403
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,007
(Laughing)

404
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,542
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

405
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:51,210
WHAT?

406
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,679
OHHH... OHHH...

407
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,047
REVISIONIST.

408
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,082
(Audience laughing)

409
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,685
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON!

410
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,887
COME ON, COME ON.

411
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,655
JUST ONCE,
YOU OUGHT TO USE YOUR BRAIN

412
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,457
BEFORE YOU USE YOUR MOUTH.

413
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:08,460
SHE'S GOT THAT BEAUTIFUL,
ROMANTIC EVENING PLANNED.

414
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,463
THE CANDLELIGHT, WINE,
THE KIDS OFF AT SLEEP-OVERS.

415
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,999
JUST AS SHE'S HAMMERING AWAY
ON THE KETCHUP BOTTLE,

416
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,468
SHE ASKS --
YOU KNOW, WHIMSICALLY...

417
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,971
"WHAT WAS THE HAPPIEST DAY
OF YOUR LIFE?"

418
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,672
AND YOU BLURT OUT, "THE DAY

419
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:23,042
"THE TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS
TRADED FOR DOUGIE GILMOUR."

420
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,411
(Audience laughing)

421
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,312
NICE WORK -- REAL SMOOTH.

422
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:28,580
YEAH, YEAH, GOOD.

423
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,549
NO WONDER
SHE'S IN THE BATHROOM,

424
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,784
BAWLING HER EYES OUT.

425
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,385
SHE WON'T BE COMING OUT.

426
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,853
CAN YOU BLAME HER?

427
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:38,357
WHAT YOU GOTTA DO IS TELL HER
WHAT YOU MEANT WAS

428
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,826
THAT YOUR LIFE WAS
ON A LOSING STREAK

429
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,728
UNTIL SHE CAME TO YOU.

430
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,931
YES! "JUST LIKE DOUGIE
COMING TO THE LEAFS, YOU'RE...

431
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,734
"YOU'RE THE CAPTAIN
OF MY HEART."

432
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,736
WOW, EH?

433
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,372
"YOU GAVE ME MY GOALS...

434
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:56,542
"EVEN BANKED A FEW
OFF THE POST."

435
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:59,711
(Audience laughing)

436
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:03,248
"JUST LIKE DOUGIE, YOU'RE
THE CENTRE WHO MADE IT WORK."

437
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,085
YEAH, YOU LOVE HER MOVES.

438
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,253
AND YOU'D LIKE TO
GIVE HER BODY A CHECK!

439
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:13,125
OR, UH... OR LOVE HER
END TO END.

440
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,961
I THINK THE HOCKEY THING
CAN GO A LITTLE TOO FAR.

441
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,963
YOU DON'T WANT
TO START MENTIONING

442
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:21,600
THAT DOUGIE HAS
NO FRONT TEETH, FOR EXAMPLE.

443
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,137
I'D ALSO STAY AWAY
FROM THE TERM "FACE-OFF".

444
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:28,941
BUT EVENTUALLY, SHE'LL COME OUT
AND RECOGNIZE YOU

445
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,610
FOR THE ROMANTIC LUG
THAT YOU ARE.

446
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,912
AND THEN, YOU KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

447
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,247
A LITTLE ONE-ON-ONE!

448
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:36,682
SUDDEN DEATH OVERTIME.

449
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:39,952
HOLD IT -- HOCKEY STOPS
WHEN YOU HIT THE BEDROOM DOOR.

450
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,254
THE LEAFS HAVEN'T GONE
ALL THE WAY SINCE '67!

451
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:45,591
(Laughing and applause)

452
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,761
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT PORTION,
WHERE WE EXAMINE

453
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:52,531
THOSE THREE WORDS
THAT MEN FIND SO HARD TO SAY.

454
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,533
(Audience):
"I DON'T KNOW!"

455
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,001
HA-HA! EXCELLENT! OK.

456
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,070
THIS WEEK, JOINING MY UNCLE RED

457
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,072
IS HIS VERY BEST FRIEND

458
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,106
IN THE WHOLE WIDE ROOM,

459
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:03,542
FERRYBOAT CAPTAIN
MR. HAP SHAUGHNESSY!

460
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:09,281
(Applause and cheering)

461
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,216
OK, ALL RIGHTY.

462
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,651
OK, OUR VIEWER WRITES...

463
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,621
"DEAR EXPERTS" -- WAHHH --

464
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:16,522
"MY HUSBAND SAYS THAT

465
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,323
"EVERYTHING ON TELEVISION
IS A LOAD OF CRAP.

466
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,993
"I PREFER TO SAY
'A LOAD OF BAD STUFF'.

467
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,729
"DO YOU THINK TELEVISION IS
A LOAD OF BAD STUFF?"

468
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,932
I DO -- IT'S ALL CRAP,
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.

469
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,201
WELL, EVERYTHING
EXCEPT THIS SHOW.

470
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,502
RIGHT, UNCLE RED?
NOT THIS SHOW.

471
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,872
ALL RIGHT, IF YOU SAY SO.

472
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:37,009
OHHHH... HOW ABOUT YOU,
MR. SHAUGHNESSY?

473
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:37,943
DO YOU THINK

474
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,578
TELEVISION'S
A LOAD OF BAD STUFF?

475
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:41,880
YEAH... YES, I DO, HAROLD.

476
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,582
YEAH, IT'S
ALL CRAP.

477
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,384
(Audience laughing)

478
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,753
IT COULD HAVE BEEN SO GREAT --
THAT'S WHAT HURTS.

479
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,322
I'M ALMOST SORRY I INVENTED IT.

480
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:53,859
INVENTED WHAT, HAP?

481
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,726
CRAP?

482
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:57,162
(Audience laughing)

483
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:00,232
NO!

484
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:02,334
TELEVISION.

485
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,638
I WAS GONNA CALL IT
"HAP-EVISION"

486
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,073
BUT I CHANGED ME MIND

487
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,475
WHEN I SAW SO MANY
OF THOSE EARLY PILOTS

488
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:11,677
AND THE WAY THEY TURNED OUT.

489
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,781
EVERYONE WAS SAYING,
"WHO INVENTED TELEVISION?"

490
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:16,949
AND I SAID,

491
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:17,916
"I'LL NEVER TELL."

492
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:21,019
THEY STARTED CALLING IT
"NEVER TELL-EVISION",

493
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,888
THEN THEY CALLED IT
"TELEVISION"

494
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,855
AND THE REST IS HISTORY.

495
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:30,529
(Audience laughing)

496
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:31,763
HISTORY IN THE MAKING, I'D SAY.

497
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,667
SO I WASHED MY HANDS
OF THE WHOLE THING,

498
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,502
OUTSIDE OF A BRIEF STINT WHEN

499
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,471
I TOOK OVER "THE TONIGHT SHOW"
FROM JACK PAAR.

500
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,742
I COULDN'T STAND
THAT HOLLYWOOD SCENE.

501
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,810
IT WAS SO PHONY.

502
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,981
TOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND OUT
IN THAT CROWD.

503
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,282
(Laughing)

504
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,718
(Singing)

505
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:55,087
YEAH.

506
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,789
(Laughing)

507
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,891
WE GOT IT -- THE LEASE IS OURS.

508
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:02,928
EXCELLENT WORK ALL THE WAY --
WE WERE SO COOL.

509
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,498
IT HELPED THAT ALMOST ALL
THE OTHER COMPETITORS WITHDREW.

510
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:08,133
NEVER UNDERSTOOD
WHY THAT HAPPENED.

511
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,302
THEY DROVE BY
AND CHANGED THEIR MINDS.

512
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,237
A LOT OF THEM NEEDED
THE BUILDINGS

513
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,072
TO BE SAFE OR INSURABLE, SO...

514
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,442
YOU COULD FIX
THIS PLACE UP.

515
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,544
THAT'S A PRETTY EXPENSIVE
PROPOSITION!

516
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,246
CONSULTANTS SAID
IT'S CHEAPER TO BLOW IT UP

517
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,114
AND LIVE IN THE HOLE.

518
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,652
THE MAIN THING IS,
WE ONLY HAD ONE COMPETITOR.

519
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:29,121
THAT WAS LEECH LODGE
FROM UP NEAR PORT ASBESTOS.

520
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,290
THEY ACTUALLY GOT THE OK
FROM THE COMMITTEE

521
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,859
BEFORE WE DID --
THAT WAS SCARY FOR A WHILE!

522
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:37,296
THEY HAD TO ASK FOR TIME
TO COME UP WITH THE FIVE BUCKS.

523
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,464
(Laughing)

524
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,866
YES, THEY DID --
IT WAS VERY ODD

525
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,834
THAT AT THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT,

526
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,469
THEIR TREASURER
LOST HIS WALLET.

527
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,772
THE MAIN THING IS,

528
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:50,575
WE GOT THE LEASE
AND WE'RE BACK IN BUSINESS.

529
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,444
YOU STOLE THAT MAN'S WALLET.

530
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:53,278
NO, I DID NOT, SIR.

531
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:56,548
YES, YOU STOLE
THEIR RENT MONEY, UNCLE RED.

532
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,784
I BORROWED THE WALLET
FOR THE HEARING,

533
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,452
GAVE IT TO THEM AFTERWARDS.

534
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,921
ANYBODY WHO LEAVES THEIR WALLET
LYING AROUND...

535
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:04,790
IT WAS IN HIS POCKET!

536
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,558
IT WAS A REALLY BAGGY POCKET.

537
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,393
(Possum squeal)

538
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:09,928
MEETING TIME, UNCLE RED.

539
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,563
I'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.

540
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:12,597
WE GOT THE LEASE, HAROLD!

541
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:14,232
WHOOO!

542
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:16,301
BY GOLLY!

543
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:17,836
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

544
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,237
I'M COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

545
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,373
I'M THINKING,
THEY SAY TIME IS MONEY.

546
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,942
IF 99 YEARS IS FIVE BUCKS,

547
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:26,912
THEN MY LIFE SO FAR
ADDS UP TO $2.39...

548
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:30,148
AND I HOPE YOU'LL AGREE
THAT I'M WORTH IT.

549
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:32,617
THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

550
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,820
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND HAROLD AND THE GANG,

551
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,589
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

552
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:40,592
(Applause and cheering)

553
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:48,967
(Possum squeal)

554
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,703
(Harold): OH, OK, ALL RIGHTY!

555
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,505
STAND UP, STAND UP!

556
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,574
ALL RISE!

557
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:00,512
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

558
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:02,180
(Red): SIT DOWN.

559
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,716
BUSTER HADFIELD WANTED ME

560
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,550
TO ANNOUNCE THAT

561
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,185
THAT ANIMAL YOU SAW

562
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:08,653
AT HIS PLACE IS NOT A CAMEL.

563
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:10,155
IT'S JUST A DONKEY

564
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,757
WITH TWO BAD MOSQUITO BITES.

565
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:15,460
OW!

566
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,028
MEETING'S ADJOURNED.
