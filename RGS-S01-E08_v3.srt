THIS WEEK IN THE HANDYMAN

77

CORNER, WE'RE GONNA SHOW YOU

78
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,672
HOW TO SOLVE THE OIL CRISIS.

79
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,839
A GOOD START IS TO GO

80
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:55,841
WITH A LIGHTWEIGHT VEHICLE

81
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:58,010
SUCH AS THIS ONE MADE ENTIRELY

82
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,178
OF WOOD, SO SHE'S NOT GONNA

83
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,347
RUST OUT ON YOU.

84
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:04,016
AND IT'S LIGHTWEIGHT, PRACTICAL,

85
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:05,351
SIMPLE--IT'S EASY TO PARK,

86
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,686
EXCELLENT VISIBILITY.

87
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,854
PLUS IT ONLY TAKES ONE PERSON,

88
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:09,855
WHICH SHOULD SAVE

89
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:11,857
A FEW MARRIAGES.

90
00:03:11,857 --> 00:03:13,693
WITH THIS UNIT, YOU STEER IT

91
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,194
WITH YOUR FEET, WHICH LEAVES

92
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,195
YOUR HANDS FREE TO USE AS

93
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,030
BRAKES.

94
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:18,864
NOW, OF COURSE, THE NEXT STEP

95
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:20,032
ON THIS ONE WAS TO FIGURE OUT

96
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:21,367
WHAT KIND OF A FUEL-EFFICIENT

97
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,868
ENGINE I COULD USE ON THIS UNIT,

98
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:24,370
AND MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS THE

99
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,206
JETEX CUBES, THOSE LITTLE CUBES.

100
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,874
I USED TO USE THEM ON MY MODEL

101
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:30,876
CARS AND MY MODEL BOATS

102
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:32,211
AND WHAT HAVE YOU, AND--

103
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,713
BUT I PHONED THE JETEX PEOPLE,

104
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,715
AND THEY WOULDN'T SELL IT TO ME

105
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,550
IN A 200-POUND BLOCK.

106
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,551
SO I HAD TO COME UP WITH

107
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,554
THE NEXT BEST THING...

108
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,456
A FIRE EXTINGUISHER.

109
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,124
SO WHAT I DO HERE IS,

110
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:46,792
I CAN SQUEEZE THE TRIGGER;

111
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:47,960
THAT FIRES THE EXTINGUISHER,

112
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,794
AND I'M HOLDING THE NOZZLE

113
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:51,130
OUT THE BACK, AND AWAY I GO.

114
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,299
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO HIT 30 OR 40

115
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,301
MILE AN HOUR ON A FLAT ROAD,

116
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,803
PUTTING OUT FIRES AS I GO.

117
00:03:57,803 --> 00:03:59,572
BUT AS THEY SAY, THE PROOF IS

118
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,573
IN THE PUDDING; IT'S USUALLY

119
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,074
WRITTEN ON THE LABEL.

120
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:05,745
SO LET'S GIVE HER A TRY.

124
00:04:37,142 --> 00:04:38,143
TO LOSE SOME WEIGHT,

125
00:04:38,143 --> 00:04:39,111
OR WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO UP

126
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:42,281
THE HORSEPOWER OF THE ENGINE.

127
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:43,782
SO WHAT I'VE DONE IS, I'VE

128
00:04:43,782 --> 00:04:45,784
ATTACHED FOUR FIRE EXTINGUISHERS

129
00:04:45,784 --> 00:04:48,787
TO THE UNIT, AND I'VE USED

130
00:04:48,787 --> 00:04:50,289
THE HANDYMAN SECRET WEAPON HERE,

131
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:51,123
DUCT TAPE, TO POSITION

132
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:52,625
EVERYTHING, AND I'VE PUT A SCARF

133
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,461
ON AS WELL BECAUSE THIS CO2 GETS

134
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,963
PRETTY COLD, AND I WOULDN'T WANT

135
00:04:57,963 --> 00:04:59,798
TO BE DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY

136
00:04:59,798 --> 00:05:00,799
70, 80 MILE AN HOUR WITH

137
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,801
A FROZEN HEAD.

138
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:04,637
ANYWAY, I THINK WE'RE ALL SET.

139
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,804
AND I THINK I'LL BE SAYING

140
00:05:05,804 --> 00:05:06,972
GOOD-BYE NOW JUST IN CASE.

141
00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:08,641
SO UNTIL NEXT TIME, REMEMBER,

142
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,642
IF THE WOMEN DON'T FIND YOU

143
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,143

144
00:05:11,143 --> 00:05:13,045

WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE

ANYWAY; WE JUST DIDN'T FIGURE

170
00:06:12,037 --> 00:06:12,871
WE'D HAVE TO REBUILD IT

FROM THE GROUND UP.

172
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:16,041
THIS SHOW IS ABOUT LIFE

173
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:16,875
HERE AT THE LODGE,

174
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,210
YOU KNOW, WITH OUR REGULAR

175
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,045
GUESTS AND WHAT HAVE YOU.

176
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:21,713
AND HOW WE EVER ENDED UP

177
00:06:21,713 --> 00:06:23,048
BLINDFOLDED AND WALKING

178
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:24,950
AN ELEPHANT IS BEYOND ME.

179
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,286
>> IT WAS A SEEING-EYE ELEPHANT.

180
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:27,953
>> I'M SORRY.

181
00:06:27,953 --> 00:06:28,921
I MISSED THAT.

182
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,255
>> A SEEING-EYE ELEPHANT,

183
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:31,256
LIKE A SEEING-EYE DOG

184
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:32,090
FOR BLIND PEOPLE,

185
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,091
ONLY, THIS WAS A SEEING-EYE

186
00:06:33,091 --> 00:06:34,092
ELEPHANT.

187
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:34,927
HE'S THE ONLY ONE IN

188
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:36,261
THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.

189
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:38,463
HE'S AN ENDANGERED SPECIES.

190
00:06:38,463 --> 00:06:40,632
>> YOU SHOULD TALK.

191
00:06:40,632 --> 00:06:42,134
>> LET'S GO TO ANOTHER CLIP.

192
00:06:42,134 --> 00:06:43,302
TV VIEWERS DON'T LIKE TO WATCH

193
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:44,303
PEOPLE TALKING.

194
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:44,970
THEY LIKE CLIPS

195
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:45,971
AND MULTIPLE IMAGES

196
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:46,972
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

197
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:47,973
INTRODUCE THE NEXT SEGMENT,

198
00:06:47,973 --> 00:06:49,107
UNCLE RED.

199
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:50,776
>> ALL RIGHT, HERE'S ONE OF MY

200
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:52,444
FAVORITE GUESTS ON THE SHOW.

201
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:53,779
HE'S NOT GRAY, HE DOESN'T HAVE

202
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:54,780
A TRUNK, AND HE KNOWS WHAT

203
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:59,451
A BATHROOM IS FOR.

204
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:00,285
>> YOU'LL NEVER FORGIVE ME,

205
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:01,286
WILL YOU?

206
00:07:01,286 --> 00:07:02,120
>> I'LL FORGIVE YOU WHEN

207
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,789
THE SMELL DISAPPEARS.

208
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:04,623
>> YOU'LL NEVER FORGIVE ME,

209
00:07:04,623 --> 00:07:07,626
WILL YOU?

210
00:07:07,626 --> 00:07:08,961
>> WELL, I'M OUT HERE ON

211
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:10,796
LOCATION AGAIN WITH DOUGIE

212
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:12,130
FRANKLIN--MY GOOD BUDDY--AND HIS

213
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,466
MONSTER TRUCK, AND, DOUGIE, THIS

214
00:07:14,466 --> 00:07:16,702
IS ONE BIG, BEAUTIFUL MACHINE.

215
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,203
>> WELL, I'LL TELL YOU, RED,

216
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:20,872
IT'S GOT TO BE BIG, YOU KNOW,

217
00:07:20,872 --> 00:07:21,707
FOR COMPETITION.

218
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:23,041
IF YOU'RE GONNA CRUSH CARS,

219
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,876
YOU NEED A BIG TRUCK.

220
00:07:24,876 --> 00:07:26,078
BUT IT'S A SPORT.

221
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,245
IT'S LIKE ANY OTHER SPORT,

222
00:07:27,245 --> 00:07:31,083
LIKE TENNIS, LIKE JAI ALAI,

223
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,752
BASEBALL, DEMOLITION DERBIES.

224
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:34,920
YOU KNOW, I'M A FINELY TUNED

225
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,521
ATHLETE, AS IS MY MACHINE,

226
00:07:36,521 --> 00:07:38,190
AND SHE'S GOT TO BE BIG.

227
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,357
AND YOU NEVER--THE THRILL

228
00:07:39,357 --> 00:07:40,525
OF COMPETITION IS WONDERFUL,

229
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:41,359
YOU KNOW.

230
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:42,694
I MEAN, YOU'RE JUST WONDERING

231
00:07:42,694 --> 00:07:44,196
HOW MANY CARS YOU'RE GONNA CRUSH

232
00:07:44,196 --> 00:07:45,864
ON A GIVEN DAY.

233
00:07:45,864 --> 00:07:47,199
IT'S A FABULOUS FEELING.

234
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,033
IT'S VERY NOW.

235
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:50,068
IT'S VERY THE '90s, ACTUALLY.

236
00:07:50,068 --> 00:07:51,403
>> YEAH, AND I THINK WE SHOULD

237
00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:53,405
POINT OUT HERE, DOUGIE, THAT WE

238
00:07:53,405 --> 00:07:55,407
ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT A BUNCH

239
00:07:55,407 --> 00:07:57,175
OF LUNATICS TEARING AROUND

240
00:07:57,175 --> 00:07:58,844
A SHOPPING MALL PARKING LOT

241
00:07:58,844 --> 00:08:00,512
FLATTENING FAMILY SEDANS HERE.

242
00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:02,180
>> OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

243
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,015
YOU'D HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING

244
00:08:04,015 --> 00:08:05,183
INSURANCE FOR THAT KIND OF

245
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:07,686
THING, RED, AND, YOU KNOW,

246
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:09,154
A LOT OF FAMILIES LEAVE THEIR

247
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:10,489
PETS IN THEIR VEHICLES WHEN

248
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:11,656
THEY GO IN TO SHOP.

249
00:08:11,656 --> 00:08:12,491
>> YEAH. YEAH.

250
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:13,492
>> AND IT'S A SAD THING WHEN

251
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:14,659
YOU SEE A KITTY STUCK IN THE

252
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:15,660
BACK WINDOW OF ONE OF THEM

253
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,496
YUPPIE VOLVO WAGONS, YOU KNOW,

254
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:19,631
JUST SWEATING ON A HOT DAY.

255
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:20,298
>> YEAH.

256
00:08:20,298 --> 00:08:21,299
>> WE DON'T WANT NONE OF THAT.

257
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:22,801
NOW, ALSO, IT'D BE VERY

258
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:24,970
DIFFICULT CHARGING ADMISSION

259
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,471
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

260
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:27,439
>> YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

261
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:29,274
>> NOW, IT'S BECAUSE OF THESE--

262
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:30,108
THIS--I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT

263
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:31,109
THIS POINT UP, RED,

264
00:08:31,109 --> 00:08:33,345
BECAUSE THE INTERNATIONAL TRUCK

265
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:36,181
AND TRACTOR ASSOCIATION,

266
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:38,350
IN COOPERATION WITH YOUR

267
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,353
FIRE DEPARTMENT--AND I BELIEVE

268
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:44,356
THE SPCA WAS IN THERE--

269
00:08:44,356 --> 00:08:45,357
THEY CAME UP WITH

270
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:46,858
A SET OF RULES.

271
00:08:46,858 --> 00:08:47,859
>> WELL, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA,

272
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:48,526
SURE, YEAH.

273
00:08:48,526 --> 00:08:49,227
>> I GOT A COPY OF IT...

274
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:49,894
>> THAT MAKES SENSE.

275
00:08:49,894 --> 00:08:50,595
>> RIGHT HERE.

276
00:08:50,595 --> 00:08:51,463
>> YOU GOT THE RULES RIGHT HERE.

277
00:08:51,463 --> 00:08:52,297
>> I DO.

278
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:53,298
THERE THEY ARE THERE.

279
00:08:53,298 --> 00:08:54,466
NOW...

280
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:55,967
>> THAT'S IT, DOUG?

281
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:56,801
>> WELL, YEAH.

282
00:08:56,801 --> 00:08:57,636
>> THESE ARE ALL THE RULES?

283
00:08:57,636 --> 00:08:58,370
>> WELL, YEAH, AND THEN ON

284
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,537
THE BACK THERE, WE GOT MISS

285
00:08:59,537 --> 00:09:02,040
TRUCK AND TRACTOR PULL 1991

286
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,375
WITH AN ENTIRE LIST OF ALL

287
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:06,044
THE EVENTS FOR THE YEAR.

288
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:07,712
>> OH, MY GOD.

289
00:09:07,712 --> 00:09:09,547
>> YEP, THERE'S A LOT OF EVENTS.

290
00:09:09,547 --> 00:09:12,384
>> DOESN'T SEEM LIKE MANY RULES.

291
00:09:12,384 --> 00:09:15,387
>> WELL, I MEAN, I DO HAVE

292
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:16,721
THE RULES MEMORIZED IF YOU WANT

293
00:09:16,721 --> 00:09:18,823
TO GO INTO THIS INTERVIEW

294
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:21,493
A LITTLE MORE IN DEPTH.

295
00:09:21,493 --> 00:09:24,662
WOULD YOU CARE TO DO THAT?

296
00:09:24,662 --> 00:09:25,830
>> ALL RIGHT, YEAH.

297
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,831
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL,

298
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:28,800
RULE NUMBER ONE...

299
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:31,436
RED, THERE'S YOUR RULE

300
00:09:31,436 --> 00:09:32,604
NUMBER ONE.

301
00:09:32,604 --> 00:09:33,938
EVERYBODY IN THIS SPORT--

302
00:09:33,938 --> 00:09:35,106
GOT TO WEAR A HELMET.

303
00:09:35,106 --> 00:09:36,441
WE'RE TALKING THE DRIVERS.

304
00:09:36,441 --> 00:09:39,277
WE'RE TALKING THE MECHANICS.

305
00:09:39,277 --> 00:09:40,945
AND ACTUALLY, WE DISTRIBUTE

306
00:09:40,945 --> 00:09:42,113
HELMETS TO THE AUDIENCE.

307
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:43,281
THE ENTIRE AUDIENCE ARE

308
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:45,950
ALL COMPLETELY HELMETED.

309
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,619
NOW, WE ALSO ENCOURAGE THE USE

310
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:48,953
OF HELMETS AT HOME FOR

311
00:09:48,953 --> 00:09:50,955
THE VIEWERS AS WELL.

312
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:53,291
NOW, RULE NUMBER TWO,

313
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,126
A VERY IMPORTANT RULE, ACTUALLY,

314
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:57,962
IS: NO RUNNING OVER THE PEOPLE

315
00:09:57,962 --> 00:09:59,464
IN THE AUDIENCE.

316
00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:00,465
IF YOU ABUSE THAT RULE,

317
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:03,301
THEN PEOPLE WILL QUIT COMING.

318
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:04,469
>> ACTUALLY, THAT SOUNDS KIND

319
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:05,637
OF VAGUE, YOU KNOW.

320
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:06,471
THAT'S MORE OF A GUIDELINE

321
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:08,806
TO ME.

322
00:10:08,806 --> 00:10:14,479
>> WELL, RED, IT HAS TO BE ABLE

323
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:16,314
TO ENCOMPASS MONSTER TRUCKS.

324
00:10:16,314 --> 00:10:17,982
THEY'RE NOT EXACT TOOLS IN

325
00:10:17,982 --> 00:10:19,751
THE SENSE OF THAT MEANING,

326
00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:21,586
BECAUSE WHEN ONE OF THESE BABIES

327
00:10:21,586 --> 00:10:26,591
GOES OVER A BIG LINE OF 1964

328
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:28,259
STRATO CHIEFS, YOU NEVER KNOW

329
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:29,260
HOW ONE OF THESE GUYS

330
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:29,928
IS GONNA FALL.

331
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:31,429
SHE COULD TILT OFF TO THE SIDE.

332
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:32,263
>> SURE. YEAH.

333
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:33,431
>> SHE COULD FLIP RIGHT OVER,

334
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:34,432
WHICH IS WHY YOU GOT THESE

335
00:10:34,432 --> 00:10:36,000
SUCKERS HERE OVER YOUR HEAD.

336
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,668
>> YEAH.

337
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:37,835
>> AND--OR SHE COULD JUST, LIKE,

338
00:10:37,835 --> 00:10:39,337
ROLL UP NEAR SOME PEOPLE AND

339
00:10:39,337 --> 00:10:40,672
JUST BLOW UP INTO A MILLION

340
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:42,340
PIECES, AND I'LL TELL YOU, IF

341
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,508
SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPENED...

342
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:44,175
>> YEAH.

343
00:10:44,175 --> 00:10:45,043
>> YOU'D BE MIGHTY GLAD YOU WAS

344
00:10:45,043 --> 00:10:47,545
WEARING YOUR HELMET, YEAH.

345
00:10:47,545 --> 00:10:48,379
>> OH, YEAH.

346
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:50,214
SO YOU JUST HAVE THE TWO RULES?

347
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:51,549
>> OH, NO, THERE'S RULE NUMBER

348
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:53,384
THREE, ACTUALLY, WHICH IS,

349
00:10:53,384 --> 00:10:57,221
IF YOU KILL ANYBODY, YOU GOT TO

350
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:59,223
STICK AROUND UNTIL THE POLICE

351
00:10:59,223 --> 00:11:00,391
SHOW UP.

352
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:01,059
>> OH, YEAH.

353
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:01,793
>> AND THERE'S A BIG STORY

354
00:11:01,793 --> 00:11:02,660
BEHIND THAT ONE, I'LL TELL YOU,

355
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,328
RED.

356
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:05,496
>> YEAH, YEAH.

357
00:11:05,496 --> 00:11:06,164
YEAH.

358
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:07,031
>> BUT, YOU KNOW, IF I COULD BE

359
00:11:07,031 --> 00:11:09,300
SERIOUS JUST FOR A MINUTE,

360
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,802
RED, SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THIS

361
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:14,806
SPORT, I HAVE MET PROBABLY

362
00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:17,975
SOME OF THE FINEST HUMAN BEINGS

363
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:20,244
I'VE EVER COME ACROSS, AND SOME

364
00:11:20,244 --> 00:11:22,914
OF THEIR TRUCKS ARE EVEN BETTER.

365
00:11:22,914 --> 00:11:23,748
[laughter]

366
00:11:23,748 --> 00:11:24,415
YEAH.

367
00:11:24,415 --> 00:11:25,249
>> I THINK YOU--MAYBE YOU

368
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:26,084
MONSTER TRUCKERS HAVE GOT IT

369
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:26,918
MADE, EH, DOUG?

370
00:11:26,918 --> 00:11:28,419
>> I'LL TELL YOU, RIGHT OFF

371
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:31,422
THE BAT, RED, I CAN'T THINK OF

372
00:11:31,422 --> 00:11:34,926
ANYTHING THAT WOULD BE MORE FUN.

373
00:11:34,926 --> 00:11:35,760
>> WELL, YOU'RE A BACHELOR,

374
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,928
AREN'T YOU, DOUG?

375
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:39,597
>> YEAH.

376
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:40,932
>> OKAY, WELL, THAT'S DOUGIE

377
00:11:40,932 --> 00:11:42,767
FRANKLIN AND HIS MONSTER TRUCK,

378
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:45,102
PROVING THAT SIZE DOES MATTER

379
00:11:45,102 --> 00:11:46,604
TO SOME GUYS ANYWAY.

380
00:11:46,604 --> 00:11:47,605
>> WHAT ABOUT THAT BACHELOR

381
00:11:47,605 --> 00:11:48,272
BUSINESS?

382
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:50,274
>> NO, NO.

383
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:53,444
[lively strumming]

384
00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:56,614
>> WHOO-OOH!

385
00:11:56,614 --> 00:11:58,616
>> I REMEMBER THE DAY

386
00:11:58,616 --> 00:12:01,118
WHEN THE RAILROAD WAS KING

387
00:12:01,118 --> 00:12:03,120
THE BIG WHEELS MAY ROLL

388
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,790
AND THUNDER

389
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,458
WE WERE TREATED LIKE FREIGHT

390
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,961
ARRIVING SEVEN HOURS LATE

391
00:12:09,961 --> 00:12:11,128
I'M PERSONALLY GLAD

392
00:12:11,128 --> 00:12:13,998
THEY'RE ALL GOING UNDER

393
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,969
>> OH, UNCLE RED, HOW EXCELLENT.

394
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:18,869
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO TELL THE

395
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:19,704
VIEWERS THAT YOU WERE GONNA

396
00:12:19,704 --> 00:12:20,705
ANSWER THEIR MAIL IN YOUR OWN

397
00:12:20,705 --> 00:12:22,707
INIMITABLE WAY.

398
00:12:22,707 --> 00:12:23,708
>> MY WHAT?

399
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,876
>> YOUR OWN INIMITABLE WAY.

400
00:12:25,876 --> 00:12:27,044
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

401
00:12:27,044 --> 00:12:28,379
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

402
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:29,247
YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF THE WORD

403
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:30,081
INIMITABLE?

404
00:12:30,081 --> 00:12:31,749
YOU NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE?

405
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:32,583
>> WELL, I'VE HEARD IT BEFORE.

406
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,485
I JUST NEVER KNEW WHAT IT MEANT.

407
00:12:34,485 --> 00:12:35,319
>> WEREN'T YOU AT ALL CURIOUS

408
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:36,153
WHAT IT MEANT?

409
00:12:36,153 --> 00:12:36,988
DIDN'T YOU THINK TO GO LOOK IT

410
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:39,490
UP IN A DICTIONARY?

411
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,358
>> YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS

412
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:41,058
EITHER, DO YOU?

413
00:12:41,058 --> 00:12:41,726
>> YES, I DO.

414
00:12:41,726 --> 00:12:42,727
I LOOKED IT UP.

415
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:44,729
IT MEANS...

416
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:46,564
RECHERCHE.

417
00:12:46,564 --> 00:12:47,565
OKAY?

418
00:12:47,565 --> 00:12:49,066
OUR FIRST LETTER TODAY ASKS FOR

419
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:51,235
SOME ADVICE FROM YOU, UNCLE RED.

420
00:12:51,235 --> 00:12:53,237
IT SAYS, "DEAR RED, I'M IN

421
00:12:53,237 --> 00:12:54,672
THE MARKET FOR A NEW CAR--

422
00:12:54,672 --> 00:12:56,007
OR NEW TO ME.

423
00:12:56,007 --> 00:12:57,008
I LIKE USED CARS.

424
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:57,675
I GUESS I'M A BIT OF

425
00:12:57,675 --> 00:12:59,176
A 'FISHY AUTO.'"

426
00:12:59,176 --> 00:13:01,012
"FISHY AUTO"?

427
00:13:01,012 --> 00:13:02,279
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

428
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,114
>> IT MEANS YOU CAN'T AFFORD

429
00:13:03,114 --> 00:13:04,081
A NEW CAR.

430
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:08,085
>> OH, WELL, HOW RECHERCHE.

431
00:13:08,085 --> 00:13:09,286
"ANY TIPS FOR THE POTENTIAL

432
00:13:09,286 --> 00:13:10,721
CAR BUYER?"

433
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:11,622
>> ALL RIGHT, THAT'S A GOOD ONE,

434
00:13:11,622 --> 00:13:12,456
HAROLD.

435
00:13:12,456 --> 00:13:13,290
I THINK WHEN YOU'RE BUYING

436
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,792
A USED CAR, INTIMIDATION IS

437
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:15,960
THE KEY.

438
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,461
DON'T JUST WALK AROUND THE CAR

439
00:13:17,461 --> 00:13:19,296
KICKING THE TIRES, OKAY?

440
00:13:19,296 --> 00:13:19,997
KICK THE FENDERS.

441
00:13:19,997 --> 00:13:20,831
KICK THE DOOR PANELS.

442
00:13:20,831 --> 00:13:21,665
KICK THE HEADLIGHTS IN.

443
00:13:21,665 --> 00:13:22,333
KICK THE DASHBOARD--

444
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,167
>> WHAT?

445
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:23,834
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WHEN

446
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:24,835
YOU DO THAT?

447
00:13:24,835 --> 00:13:26,170
>> WELL, YOU'RE TRYING TO GET

448
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,671
THE COST OF THE CAR DOWN,

449
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:29,507
AND A CAR WITH KICK MARKS ALL

450
00:13:29,507 --> 00:13:30,341
OVER IT HAS GOT TO BE

451
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:31,509
A LOWER PRICE.

452
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:32,409
>> OH, SO I GUESS WE CAN ASSUME,

453
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:33,410
THEN, THE PROPER FOOTWEAR

454
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,245
IS REQUIRED.

455
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:34,945
>> ABSOLUTELY.

456
00:13:34,945 --> 00:13:35,946
AND I'D SAY THAT PROPER FOOTWEAR

457
00:13:35,946 --> 00:13:36,781
IS THE KEY, AS THE

458
00:13:36,781 --> 00:13:38,315
INTIMIDATION IS.

459
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:39,583
AND ANOTHER THING IS, YOU WANT

460
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:40,584
TO ASK 'EM IF YOU CAN TAKE IT

461
00:13:40,584 --> 00:13:41,919
FOR A TEST-DRIVE.

462
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,921
IF THEY SAY NO, THEN I'D

463
00:13:43,921 --> 00:13:44,955
WONDER ABOUT THAT.

464
00:13:44,955 --> 00:13:47,958
AND THEY HAVE TRICKS, HAROLD.

465
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:48,959
I KNOW WHEN I BOUGHT MY TRUCK,

466
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,295
THEY HAD SCOTCH-TAPED A COUPLE

467
00:13:51,295 --> 00:13:52,463
OF EXTRA SPARK PLUGS ONTO

468
00:13:52,463 --> 00:13:54,131
THE ENGINE TO TRY TO CONVINCE ME

469
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:57,301
THAT THE V6 WAS A V8.

470
00:13:57,301 --> 00:13:58,469
I CAUGHT ON TO IT.

471
00:13:58,469 --> 00:13:59,303
>> OH, YEAH?

472
00:13:59,303 --> 00:14:00,538
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

473
00:14:00,538 --> 00:14:01,372
>> WELL, THEY FELL OFF WHEN I

474
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:03,541
KICKED THE ENGINE.

475
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,343
>> OH, SO KICKING IS IMPORTANT?

476
00:14:06,343 --> 00:14:08,012
>> WELL, IT SHOWS THAT YOU KNOW

477
00:14:08,012 --> 00:14:09,513
CARS, YOU KNOW.

478
00:14:09,513 --> 00:14:10,514
I MEAN, EVEN KICK THE SALESMAN

479
00:14:10,514 --> 00:14:11,181
IF YOU HAVE TO.

480
00:14:11,181 --> 00:14:12,016
>> ON, NO, NO, NO.

481
00:14:12,016 --> 00:14:13,017
WAIT A SECOND, UNCLE RED.

482
00:14:13,017 --> 00:14:14,018
I THINK YOU'VE GONE OVER THE TOP

483
00:14:14,018 --> 00:14:14,852
ON THAT ONE.

484
00:14:14,852 --> 00:14:15,853
WE DO NOT WANT TO ADVOCATE

485
00:14:15,853 --> 00:14:17,454
VIOLENCE.

486
00:14:17,454 --> 00:14:18,522
>> WELL, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,

487
00:14:18,522 --> 00:14:19,690
THEN DON'T KICK THE SALESMAN.

488
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:20,357
>> RIGHT.

489
00:14:20,357 --> 00:14:21,859
>> YOU KNOW, BUT YOU MIGHT WANT

490
00:14:21,859 --> 00:14:23,861
TO CHECK THE INSTRUMENT PANEL.

491
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:25,029
IF YOU LOOK AT THE ODOMETER

492
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:26,530
AND YOU SEE A BUNCH OF MARKS

493
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,699
FROM A CLAW HAMMER AND IT'S

494
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:30,367
A TEN-YEAR-OLD CAR WITH, SAY,

495
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:32,036
19 MILES ON IT,

496
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:34,104
I'D QUESTION THAT.

497
00:14:34,104 --> 00:14:35,105
>> YEAH, THAT'S REALLY GOOD

498
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:35,839
ADVICE.

499
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:36,707
THAT'S SOMETHING TO REMEMBER.

500
00:14:36,707 --> 00:14:37,374
>> YEAH.

501
00:14:37,374 --> 00:14:38,542
>> YEAH, UNCLE RED, I WAS--

502
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:39,610
IS, LIKE, THERE, LIKE, A GOOD

503
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,779
TIME OR A BAD TIME TO BUY A CAR?

504
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:43,947
>> YEAH, NEVER BUY A CAR AT

505
00:14:43,947 --> 00:14:45,783
3:00 IN THE MORNING.

506
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:47,117
>> ALL RIGHT, THAT'S--

507
00:14:47,117 --> 00:14:48,285
AND HOW ABOUT, LIKE,

508
00:14:48,285 --> 00:14:49,286
NORTH AMERICAN CARS

509
00:14:49,286 --> 00:14:51,288
VERSUS DOMESTIC CARS?

510
00:14:51,288 --> 00:14:52,122
NO, I MEAN, NO--

511
00:14:52,122 --> 00:14:53,123
[chuckles]

512
00:14:53,123 --> 00:14:54,458
I MEAN, LIKE JAPANESE CARS

513
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:55,459
VERSUS IMPORTED--

514
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:56,293
NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT EITHER.

515
00:14:56,293 --> 00:14:57,061
>> ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,

516
00:14:57,061 --> 00:14:57,761
I UNDERSTAND.

517
00:14:57,761 --> 00:14:58,929
I GOT IT.

518
00:14:58,929 --> 00:14:59,930
WITH THE JAPANESE CARS, YOU GET

519
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,598
MORE FEATURES, BUT WITH THE

520
00:15:01,598 --> 00:15:03,100
AMERICAN CARS, YOU GET MORE

521
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,034
METAL.

522
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:05,202
AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

523
00:15:05,202 --> 00:15:06,203
YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL GONNA HAVE

524
00:15:06,203 --> 00:15:08,205
HEAD-ON COLLISIONS NOW AND THEN,

525
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:09,373
SO YOU'RE BETTER TO GIVE UP

526
00:15:09,373 --> 00:15:11,041
THE POWER SUNROOF AND GO WITH

527
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,377
A LITTLE MORE MOMENTUM.

528
00:15:13,377 --> 00:15:14,711
>> I HOPE THAT ANSWERS ALL OUR

529
00:15:14,711 --> 00:15:15,879
VIEWER'S QUESTIONS.

530
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:16,713
>> YEAH, AND DON'T FORGET TO

531
00:15:16,713 --> 00:15:19,183
KICK EVERYTHING.

532
00:15:23,454 --> 00:15:25,289
WE HAVE OUR OUTDOOR EXPERT,

533
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:26,957
BILL, WITH US THIS WEEK ON

534
00:15:26,957 --> 00:15:29,960
A--OH!

535
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,462
GONNA TEACH US ABOUT--I THINK

536
00:15:31,462 --> 00:15:32,629
HE'S JUST FOOLING AROUND THERE.

537
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:34,298
GONNA TEACH US ABOUT CANOEING

538
00:15:34,298 --> 00:15:35,799
AND THE VARIOUS TECHNIQUES TO

539
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:37,634
USE FOR THE BEGINNING CANOER.

540
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:38,635
'CAUSE YOU KNOW IN THESE DAYS,

541
00:15:38,635 --> 00:15:40,137
WHEN THE CAST--COST OF GAS

542
00:15:40,137 --> 00:15:41,705
AND EVERY--AND THE CAST OF GOSS

543
00:15:41,705 --> 00:15:43,373
AND ALL THAT STUFF IS SO HIGH--

544
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:44,374
NOW, THIS IS A PADDLE

545
00:15:44,374 --> 00:15:45,375
MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE.

546
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,543
YOU WANT TO--YOU WANT THE PADDLE

547
00:15:46,543 --> 00:15:47,878
TO COME UP TO ABOUT YOUR CHIN.

548
00:15:47,878 --> 00:15:48,712
SO ONE'S TOO SHORT,

549
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:49,880
AND ONE'S TOO TALL.

550
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,216
SO BILL COMES UP WITH A SOLUTION

551
00:15:52,216 --> 00:15:54,885
TO THAT PROBLEM.

552
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:56,887
MAYBE NOT THE IDEAL SOLUTION

553
00:15:56,887 --> 00:15:59,389
BUT A SOLUTION NONETHELESS.

554
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:01,558
AND THAT ONE WAS FINE ANYWAY.

555
00:16:01,558 --> 00:16:02,893
SO ANYWAY, IT ALL WORKED OUT.

556
00:16:02,893 --> 00:16:03,727
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE LOTS OF

557
00:16:03,727 --> 00:16:04,561
PADDLES.

558
00:16:04,561 --> 00:16:05,896
AND NOW HE'S GONNA SHOW YOU

559
00:16:05,896 --> 00:16:07,231
HOW TO GET INTO A CANOE.

560
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:08,565
NOW, I THINK A LOT OF WHAT BILL

561
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:10,067
DOES IS, HE SHOWS YOU, YOU KNOW,

562
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:12,903
THE WRONG...

563
00:16:12,903 --> 00:16:15,272
WRONG WAY TO DO THINGS.

564
00:16:15,272 --> 00:16:17,274
I THINK HE KNEW THAT WAS COMING,

565
00:16:17,274 --> 00:16:18,108
BUT HE'S OKAY.

566
00:16:18,108 --> 00:16:21,778
NO PROBLEM.

567
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:23,447
AND THEN WHAT HE WANTS TO SHOW--

568
00:16:23,447 --> 00:16:24,214
NOW HE'S SHOWING YOU HOW TO

569
00:16:24,214 --> 00:16:24,881
GET IN FROM THE SIDE.

570
00:16:24,881 --> 00:16:25,716
THAT WAS THE END SHOT.

571
00:16:25,716 --> 00:16:26,550
THIS IS THE SIDE SHOT.

572
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,553
BUT HERE AGAIN, I DON'T--I THINK

573
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:31,221
BILL--YEAH, YEAH, I'M PRETTY

574
00:16:31,221 --> 00:16:33,724
SURE HE MEANT TO DO THAT.

575
00:16:33,724 --> 00:16:34,558
HE JUST LOOKED LIKE HE WAS

576
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:35,225
PANICKING.

577
00:16:35,225 --> 00:16:36,059
THAT'S ALL THERE.

578
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:36,827
IT'S JUST ALL FOR EFFECT,

579
00:16:36,827 --> 00:16:38,161
I THINK.

580
00:16:38,161 --> 00:16:39,830
AND NOW BILL'S GONNA SHOW YOU

581
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,164
AN INTERESTING WAY TO GET IN,

582
00:16:41,164 --> 00:16:42,366
WHICH IS THE RUNNING START,

583
00:16:42,366 --> 00:16:43,367
KIND OF REMINISCENT OF

584
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:44,534
WILD BILL HICKOK, YOU KNOW.

585
00:16:44,534 --> 00:16:45,702
AND THAT WAY, YOU'RE ON YOUR

586
00:16:45,702 --> 00:16:47,204
WAY--UNFORTUNATELY, HE FORGOT

587
00:16:47,204 --> 00:16:49,206
TO TAKE A PADDLE, BUT, YOU KNOW,

588
00:16:49,206 --> 00:16:50,040
I'M THERE.

589
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,043
I CAN--WELL, I MEAN, I WAS--

590
00:16:53,043 --> 00:16:54,711
YOU KNOW, I WAS DOING MY BEST.

591
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:55,879
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO

592
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:57,047
ESTIMATE 'CAUSE HE'S MOVING.

593
00:16:57,047 --> 00:16:57,881
YOU KNOW, IT'S TOUGH.

594
00:16:57,881 --> 00:16:58,882
AND I GOT A BIT CLOSER

595
00:16:58,882 --> 00:17:00,217
WITH THIS ONE.

596
00:17:00,217 --> 00:17:01,051
OH!

597
00:17:01,051 --> 00:17:02,719
OH, MY GOSH.

598
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,554
ANYWAY, HE BRINGS THE CANOE

599
00:17:04,554 --> 00:17:05,722
BACK IN, AND WE NOW HAVE A

600
00:17:05,722 --> 00:17:07,557
WEEK'S SUPPLY OF DRINKING WATER.

601
00:17:07,557 --> 00:17:09,726
AND WE'LL CLEAN THAT UP

602
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:10,393
LATER ON.

603
00:17:10,393 --> 00:17:11,561
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

604
00:17:11,561 --> 00:17:13,396
SO NOW BILL'S GONNA SHOW US

605
00:17:13,396 --> 00:17:15,065
THE VARIOUS PADDLING TECHNIQUES.

606
00:17:15,065 --> 00:17:16,066
NOW, WHAT YOU WANT TO DO, YOU

607
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:17,234
STICK YOUR RIGHT ARM OUT THERE

608
00:17:17,234 --> 00:17:18,268
AND THEN GRIP IT RIGHT

609
00:17:18,268 --> 00:17:20,604
WHERE IT GETS FAT, YOU KNOW.

610
00:17:20,604 --> 00:17:21,605
IT REMINDS ME OF A DATE I WAS

611
00:17:21,605 --> 00:17:22,305
ON ONE TIME.

612
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:23,640
BUT ANYWAY, AND THEN PUT

613
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,908
THE OTHER HAND OVER THE END,

614
00:17:24,908 --> 00:17:26,910
AND--NO, NO, NO, THERE'S

615
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,913
SOMETHING WRONG HERE.

616
00:17:29,913 --> 00:17:31,081
THAT DOESN'T LOOK--NO, THAT

617
00:17:31,081 --> 00:17:32,749
DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT EITHER.

618
00:17:32,749 --> 00:17:35,252
OH...[muttering]

619
00:17:35,252 --> 00:17:37,087
AND NOW HE'S JUST USING THE DOCK

620
00:17:37,087 --> 00:17:37,921
TO SHOW YOU JUST A--

621
00:17:37,921 --> 00:17:38,655
crack!

622
00:17:38,655 --> 00:17:39,990
OH!

623
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,158
OH, MY GOSH.

624
00:17:42,158 --> 00:17:43,493
WE GO--WE DO GO THROUGH A LOT

625
00:17:43,493 --> 00:17:45,795
OF PADDLES IN A SEASON, BUT

626
00:17:45,795 --> 00:17:46,963
EVENTUALLY, IT GETS TO THE POINT

627
00:17:46,963 --> 00:17:48,131
WHERE THE STUDENT, YOU KNOW, HAS

628
00:17:48,131 --> 00:17:50,133
TO HAVE HIS FIRST SOLO FLIGHT,

629
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:51,134
AND I WAS PRETTY EXCITED

630
00:17:51,134 --> 00:17:52,636
ABOUT THIS, AND I THINK

631
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:53,803
I WAS DOING A HECK OF A JOB.

632
00:17:53,803 --> 00:17:54,571
I DIDN'T HIT THE DOCK,

633
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:56,072
AND I GOT MOVING PRETTY GOOD

634
00:17:56,072 --> 00:17:57,240
THERE, YOU KNOW.

635
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,241
AND I WAS QUITE PROUD.

636
00:17:58,241 --> 00:17:59,175
OH! OH! OH! OH!

637
00:17:59,175 --> 00:18:00,343
OH! OH! OH! OH!

638
00:18:00,343 --> 00:18:02,178
OH, OH...

639
00:18:02,178 --> 00:18:03,179
YOU KNOW, IN RETROSPECT, I THINK

640
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:04,247
BILL SHOULD HAVE TAUGHT ME HOW

641
00:18:04,247 --> 00:18:05,849
TO TURN THIS THING AROUND TOO.

642
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:08,318
OH, WELL, HE'S FINE.

643
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:11,921
"IT IS WINTER.

644
00:18:11,921 --> 00:18:13,757
YOUR BREATH FORMS HUGE CLOUDS

645
00:18:13,757 --> 00:18:14,924
THAT BILLOW OUT

646
00:18:14,924 --> 00:18:16,426
AND BLOCK YOUR FACE.

647
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:19,095
HOT AIR, THICK AND SWIRLING.

648
00:18:19,095 --> 00:18:19,929
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET

649
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:21,898
FOR EATING SKUNK."

650
00:18:34,944 --> 00:18:36,780
EVERY WEEK WE HAVE HAROLD HERE

651
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,615
COME UP WITH A VIEWPOINT TO GIVE

652
00:18:38,615 --> 00:18:39,783
YOU SOME INSIGHT ON WHAT THE

653
00:18:39,783 --> 00:18:40,917
YOUNG PEOPLE OF TODAY ARE

654
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:42,752
THINKING ABOUT, AND, AH, IT'S

655
00:18:42,752 --> 00:18:43,753
PROBABLY NOT THE WORST THING

656
00:18:43,753 --> 00:18:47,424
YOU'LL EVER SEE ON TELEVISION.

657
00:18:47,424 --> 00:18:50,593
>> OKAY, OKAY, PIXY STIX.

658
00:18:50,593 --> 00:18:51,761
I REMEMBER ONE TIME WHEN I WAS

659
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:52,996
A LITTLE BOY, RIGHT, I READ IN

660
00:18:52,996 --> 00:18:54,330
THE BACK OF A COMIC BOOK,

661
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,031
YOU COULD ORDER, LIKE,

662
00:18:55,031 --> 00:18:56,599
ALL THESE PIXY STIX.

663
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:58,701
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE, RIGHT?

664
00:18:58,701 --> 00:19:00,370
THEY'RE LIKE--OKAY, PIXY STIX

665
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,871
ARE LIKE STRAWS, RIGHT,

666
00:19:01,871 --> 00:19:03,373
AND THEY'RE CLOSED AT BOTH ENDS,

667
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:04,107
BUT THEY'RE FILLED WITH,

668
00:19:04,107 --> 00:19:04,941
LIKE, POWDERED SUGAR

669
00:19:04,941 --> 00:19:05,942
AND FLAVOR CRYSTALS,

670
00:19:05,942 --> 00:19:06,943
AND YOU JUST GO...[slurps]

671
00:19:06,943 --> 00:19:08,144
YOU SUCK ALL THE POWDER OUT

672
00:19:08,144 --> 00:19:08,945
OF THEM, RIGHT?

673
00:19:08,945 --> 00:19:09,679
THEY'RE EXCELLENT.

674
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:10,380
THEY REALLY ARE.

675
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,080
THEY'RE REALLY GOOD.

676
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,948
AND I READ IN A BOOK THAT

677
00:19:11,948 --> 00:19:13,783
YOU COULD ORDER, LIKE, 1,000 OF

678
00:19:13,783 --> 00:19:15,952
THEM FOR 10 BUCKS.

679
00:19:15,952 --> 00:19:17,120
GREAT DEAL, RIGHT?

680
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,289
SO I GET MY BEST FRIEND--

681
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:20,790
WELL, OKAY, I GET MY ONLY

682
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,625
FRIEND, LARRY GORMAN.

683
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:23,960
SO HIM AND I, WE GET TOGETHER,

684
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,795
RIGHT, AND WE FIGURE, "HEY, WHAT

685
00:19:25,795 --> 00:19:27,297
A PERFECT CAUSE TO DEDICATE OUR

686
00:19:27,297 --> 00:19:28,298
LIVES TO WHILE WAITING TO

687
00:19:28,298 --> 00:19:30,466
MATURE," RIGHT?

688
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:31,301
SO WE DO THIS.

689
00:19:31,301 --> 00:19:34,137
AND THEN WE SAVE ALL OUR MONEY,

690
00:19:34,137 --> 00:19:35,972
AND WE SAID--WAIT, NO, WE HAD

691
00:19:35,972 --> 00:19:36,639
MONEY.

692
00:19:36,639 --> 00:19:37,373
WE JUST ORDERED THEM.

693
00:19:37,373 --> 00:19:38,041
OH, YEAH.

694
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:38,875
YEAH, WE JUST ORDERED THEM.

695
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,043
AND ABOUT A MONTH LATER, WE GOT

696
00:19:40,043 --> 00:19:42,345
THIS BOX FROM RACINE, WISCONSIN.

697
00:19:42,345 --> 00:19:45,014
WE OPEN IT UP--

698
00:19:45,014 --> 00:19:46,516
1,000 PIXY STIX!

699
00:19:46,516 --> 00:19:47,250
UGH!

700
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,251
BONUS DAY OR WHAT, RIGHT?

701
00:19:48,251 --> 00:19:49,586
SO WE START EATING ALL THESE

702
00:19:49,586 --> 00:19:50,253
THINGS.

703
00:19:50,253 --> 00:19:51,421
WE'RE SUCKING ALL THE SUGAR

704
00:19:51,421 --> 00:19:52,188
OUT OF THEM.

705
00:19:52,188 --> 00:19:53,189
LIKE, OUR FACES ARE ALL PUCKERED

706
00:19:53,189 --> 00:19:53,923
AND EVERYTHING.

707
00:19:53,923 --> 00:19:54,591
IT WAS GREAT.

708
00:19:54,591 --> 00:19:55,758
WE KEPT DOING THIS UNTIL I GOT

709
00:19:55,758 --> 00:19:57,594
SICK, AND HE HYPERVENTILATED AN

710
00:19:57,594 --> 00:20:00,096
ENTIRE LUNG OF POWDERED SUGAR.

711
00:20:00,096 --> 00:20:03,599
WHAT A GREAT DAY.

712
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:06,102
WELL, THERE'S NO REAL POINT

713
00:20:06,102 --> 00:20:06,936
TO THE STORY.

714
00:20:06,936 --> 00:20:07,770
I JUST WANTED TO RELATE THAT

715
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,605
TO YOU.

716
00:20:09,605 --> 00:20:10,606
I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE SUNG

717
00:20:10,606 --> 00:20:14,277
OR SOMETHING, EH?

718
00:20:14,277 --> 00:20:15,278
>> DUMBO AND I WILL BE

719
00:20:15,278 --> 00:20:16,612
RIGHT BACK.

720
00:20:16,612 --> 00:20:17,447
>> HE ONLY CALLS ME THAT

721
00:20:17,447 --> 00:20:18,781
'CAUSE I WORK FOR PEANUTS.

722
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:22,118
[chuckles]

723
00:20:22,118 --> 00:20:24,087
LIGHTEN UP.

724
00:20:32,662 --> 00:20:33,763
>> YOU KNOW, I GOT THE OUTBOARD

725
00:20:33,763 --> 00:20:34,831
OVERHAULED THE OTHER DAY,

726
00:20:34,831 --> 00:20:35,832
AND WHEN I WENT TO PICK IT UP,

727
00:20:35,832 --> 00:20:37,166
A FELLA--A YOUNG FELLA THERE

728
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,167
HAD AN EARRING.

729
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:39,168
>> OH, YEAH, I KNOW HIM.

730
00:20:39,168 --> 00:20:40,503
>> KIND OF A LITTLE STUD

731
00:20:40,503 --> 00:20:41,504
OR A JEWEL OR SOMETHING.

732
00:20:41,504 --> 00:20:42,338
NO, I DON'T MEAN HIM;

733
00:20:42,338 --> 00:20:44,006
I MEAN THE EARRING.

734
00:20:44,006 --> 00:20:44,841
>> YEAH.

735
00:20:44,841 --> 00:20:45,508
>> WHAT IS IT WITH THAT?

736
00:20:45,508 --> 00:20:46,676
>> THAT'S FASHION.

737
00:20:46,676 --> 00:20:48,010
THAT'S THE BEST.

738
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,178
>> IS THAT A SEXUAL ORIENTATION

739
00:20:49,178 --> 00:20:50,012
THING OR...

740
00:20:50,012 --> 00:20:50,747
>> I THINK NOT.

741
00:20:50,747 --> 00:20:52,415
IT JUST SAYS YOU'RE REALLY COOL

742
00:20:52,415 --> 00:20:54,083
AND ABOVE STEREOTYPING.

743
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:54,917
IT'S WONDERFUL.

744
00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:56,085
PIRATES USED TO WEAR THEM,

745
00:20:56,085 --> 00:20:57,753
AND WOULD YOU CONFRONT A PIRATE

746
00:20:57,753 --> 00:20:58,754
IN A DARK ALLEY?

747
00:20:58,754 --> 00:20:59,755
>> PIRATES HAD EARRINGS?

748
00:20:59,755 --> 00:21:01,257
>> OH, YES, SOME OF THEM,

749
00:21:01,257 --> 00:21:02,425
BUT MOST OF THEM WERE CLIP-ONS,

750
00:21:02,425 --> 00:21:03,259
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU

751
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:04,293
HAVE TO GO OUT ON THE WEEKEND,

752
00:21:04,293 --> 00:21:05,128
YOU DON'T WANT EVERYBODY TO SEE

753
00:21:05,128 --> 00:21:05,962
THE HOLE IN YOUR EAR.

754
00:21:05,962 --> 00:21:07,130
>> WELL, THERE--THAT'S IT, THEN.

755
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,297
LIKE, WHAT DO YOU DO, YOU KNOW,

756
00:21:08,297 --> 00:21:09,298
WHEN YOU HAVE TO GO TO A FAMILY

757
00:21:09,298 --> 00:21:10,466
EVENT LIKE A FUNERAL OR

758
00:21:10,466 --> 00:21:11,133
SOMETHING?

759
00:21:11,133 --> 00:21:11,801
>> WELL, YOU CAN PUT

760
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:12,468
A FANCY ONE IN.

761
00:21:12,468 --> 00:21:13,302
YOU WOULDN'T WEAR JUST, LIKE,

762
00:21:13,302 --> 00:21:13,970
ANYTHING.

763
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:14,670
YOU'D HAVE TO WEAR LIKE

764
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,505
DIAMONDS TO GO WITH A SUIT

765
00:21:15,505 --> 00:21:16,339
OR A PEARL OR--

766
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:17,173
>> YOU MEAN YOU'RE TELLING ME

767
00:21:17,173 --> 00:21:17,874
THAT AN EARRING IS NOT

768
00:21:17,874 --> 00:21:19,108
A FEMALE, UH...

769
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:21,110
>> NOT NECESSARILY, NO.

770
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,279
I WAS THINKING OF GETTING ONE.

771
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:23,946
>> REALLY?

772
00:21:23,946 --> 00:21:24,780
>> YEAH, I WAS PLAYING WITH

773
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,949
YOUR STUD SETTER THE OTHER DAY.

774
00:21:26,949 --> 00:21:28,451
AND I PIERCED MY FINGER,

775
00:21:28,451 --> 00:21:29,452
AND I THOUGHT, "WELL, WOULDN'T

776
00:21:29,452 --> 00:21:30,453
THAT LOOK SILLY, AN EARRING ON

777
00:21:30,453 --> 00:21:31,454
MY FINGER?"

778
00:21:31,454 --> 00:21:32,255
>> WELL, YOU SURE DON'T NEED

779
00:21:32,255 --> 00:21:34,891
ANOTHER HOLE IN YOUR HEAD.

780
00:21:39,495 --> 00:21:41,330
WELL, ANYWAY, I REALLY HATE TO

781
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,833
DRAG FAMILY ARGUMENTS INTO MY

782
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,168
TELEVISION SHOW, BUT I'M SORRY;

783
00:21:46,168 --> 00:21:47,837
WE JUST HAVE SOMEBODY HERE WHO

784
00:21:47,837 --> 00:21:49,005
HAS TO BE TAUGHT A LESSON.

785
00:21:49,005 --> 00:21:52,174
HAROLD, COME ON OVER HERE.

786
00:21:52,174 --> 00:21:53,676
NOW, HAROLD, I KNOW THAT YOU

787
00:21:53,676 --> 00:21:55,177
THINK I'M MAKING A REAL BIG

788
00:21:55,177 --> 00:21:56,879
TO-DO OUT OF THIS ELEPHANT THING

789
00:21:56,879 --> 00:21:59,048
AND THAT YOU THINK I'M MEAN

790
00:21:59,048 --> 00:21:59,882
AND I'M JUST DOING IT TO

791
00:21:59,882 --> 00:22:01,617
RIDICULE YOU AND MAKE YOU CRY ON

792
00:22:01,617 --> 00:22:02,985
TELEVISION, THAT KIND OF THING.

793
00:22:02,985 --> 00:22:04,487
AND I KNOW YOU THINK I SHOULD

794
00:22:04,487 --> 00:22:06,822
JUST LIGHTEN UP, AND MAYBE--

795
00:22:06,822 --> 00:22:07,823
I MEAN, MAYBE WHAT YOU DID

796
00:22:07,823 --> 00:22:08,824
WRONG--AND BELIEVE ME, THERE WAS

797
00:22:08,824 --> 00:22:10,493
PLENTY OF IT--MAYBE YOU THOUGHT

798
00:22:10,493 --> 00:22:11,661
YOU WERE DOING THE BEST THING

799
00:22:11,661 --> 00:22:13,329
FOR THE SHOW.

800
00:22:13,329 --> 00:22:15,664
MAYBE WHAT YOU DID WAS OUT OF

801
00:22:15,664 --> 00:22:18,134
MAYBE CARING ABOUT YOUR WORK.

802
00:22:18,134 --> 00:22:22,138
AND I KNOW THAT YOU LIKE ME.

803
00:22:22,138 --> 00:22:23,139
I KNOW YOU'RE VERY FOND OF ME,

804
00:22:23,139 --> 00:22:24,140
HAROLD, AND I KNOW THAT YOU

805
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,975
LOOK UP TO ME, AND YOU REALLY

806
00:22:25,975 --> 00:22:28,644
RESPECT MY JUDGMENT.

807
00:22:31,147 --> 00:22:33,983
SO I'VE DECIDED TO KIND OF

808
00:22:33,983 --> 00:22:35,985
JUST LET IT GO AS A WARNING

809
00:22:35,985 --> 00:22:37,486
AT THIS POINT, HAROLD.

810
00:22:37,486 --> 00:22:38,988
BUT I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER

811
00:22:38,988 --> 00:22:40,156
WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

812
00:22:40,156 --> 00:22:41,824
AND FROM NOW ON, I WANT YOU TO

813
00:22:41,824 --> 00:22:43,159
COME TO ME BEFORE YOU MAKE

814
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:44,760
THESE BIG DECISIONS, ALL RIGHT?

815
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,428
>> I WILL.

816
00:22:45,428 --> 00:22:46,262
YEAH, THANKS VERY MUCH,

817
00:22:46,262 --> 00:22:47,263
UNCLE RED.

818
00:22:47,263 --> 00:22:48,164
>> OKAY, NOW, I'M ONLY DOING

819
00:22:48,164 --> 00:22:49,331
THIS BECAUSE YOU PROMISED ME

820
00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:50,499
THAT YOU WEREN'T THE ONES WHO

821
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:51,500
GAVE THE LAXATIVES TO

822
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,501
THE ELEPHANT, RIGHT?

823
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:53,235
>> THAT'S RIGHT!

824
00:22:53,235 --> 00:22:53,903
THAT'S RIGHT!

825
00:22:53,903 --> 00:22:54,570
WASN'T ME.

826
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,239
THAT'S RIGHT!

827
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:59,074
>> ALL RIGHT, SO IF MY WIFE IS

828
00:22:59,074 --> 00:23:01,243
WATCHING, THANK YOU FOR TAPING

829
00:23:01,243 --> 00:23:02,244
THE SHOW TONIGHT, AND WHEN

830
00:23:02,244 --> 00:23:03,245
I COME HOME, I'M GONNA STAY UP

831
00:23:03,245 --> 00:23:04,914
A BIT LATE, AND I'M GONNA WATCH

832
00:23:04,914 --> 00:23:06,248
THIS PART BACK.

833
00:23:06,248 --> 00:23:07,750
AND IF I SEE HAROLD LAUGHING

834
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,586
BEHIND ME, HE IS DEAD MEAT.

835
00:23:10,586 --> 00:23:13,923
SO ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND WHAT

836
00:23:13,923 --> 00:23:16,091
IS PROBABLY HAROLD'S LAST SHOW

837
00:23:16,091 --> 00:23:17,259
AND THE WHOLE GANG UP HERE AT

838
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:18,427
THE LODGE, UNTIL NEXT TIME,

839
00:23:18,427 --> 00:23:20,529
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.
