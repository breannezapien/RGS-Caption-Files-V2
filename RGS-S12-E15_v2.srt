1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,772
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU BEEN
IN THE MIDDLE OF A HOT SHOWER

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,241
WHEN SOMEBODY FLUSHES
THE TOILET SOMEWHERE

3
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:12,245
AND YOU UNDERGO A REAL QUICK
CHANGE IN TEMPERATURE
AND HEART RATE?

4
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:14,280
I'LL TELL YOU IT'S THE
BIGGEST SHOCK YOU CAN
GET IN THE BATHROOM

5
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:17,250
SINCE THE INVENTION OF
THE FULL-LENGTH MIRROR.

6
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:19,519
WELL, I HAVE A
REAL SIMPLE SOLUTION.

7
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:21,988
GET YOURSELF A BUNCH
OF THESE SAFETY FLARES.

8
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,124
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE JUST THROW
THEM INTO THE TRUNK
OF THEIR CAR,

9
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:25,658
AND THEN THEY
FORGET ABOUT THEM.

10
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,495
SO NOBODY'S GONNA MIND IF YOU
JUST KINDA HELP YOURSELF.

11
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:32,999
WHAT YOU DO IS YOU
JUST WRAP THESE BABIES

12
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,901
IN AROUND YOUR
SHOWER HEAD, SEE?

13
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,970
JUST LIKE THAT THERE.

14
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,305
THEN WHEN YOU LIGHT 'EM,
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IS

15
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:42,175
THEY'RE GONNA HEAT THE WATER
AS IT COMES THROUGH THE PIPE.

16
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,651
WHICH MEANS ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS TURN ON THE COLD WATER.

17
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:53,219
THAT SAVES YOU MONEY.

18
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:56,122
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,
IT'S FLUSH PROOF.

19
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:00,493
PERFECT.

20
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:02,796
AND YOU KNOW,
UNDER THIS WARM GLOW,

21
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:07,033
EVEN US MIDDLE AGED GUYS
DON'T LOOK TOO BAD NAKED.

22
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,636
I WONDER WHAT BERNICE
IS DOING RIGHT NOW?

23
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:18,912
[laughter and applause]

24
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,087
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

25
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:28,955
APPRECIATE THAT.

26
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,124
BIG, BIG WEEK UP
AT THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

27
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,526
IT'S OUR ANNUAL
MR. POSSUM LAKE COMPETITION

28
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,562
WITH CARIBOU LODGE THERE.

29
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,064
IT'S BASED ON
STRENGTH AND SPEED.

30
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:42,035
ONE YEAR WE BASED IT ON LOOKS,
BUT EVERYBODY CAME IN FOURTH.

31
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,871
SO WE'VE GONE BACK
TO STRENGTH AND SPEED

32
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,840
BECAUSE IF YOU CAN'T BE
STRONG, YOU GOTTA BE FAST;

33
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:49,242
IF YOU CAN'T BE FAST,
YOU GOTTA BE STRONG.

34
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,578
IF YOU CAN BE BOTH YOU
CAN BE MR. POSSUM LAKE.

35
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,314
IF YOU CAN'T BE EITHER,
YOU CAN BE HAROLD.

36
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:59,119
[laughter and applause]

37
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,188
HI, UNCLE RED.

38
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,723
WHAT'S WITH
THE BASKET?

39
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:05,291
YOU ON YOUR WAY
TO GRANDMA'S HOUSE?

40
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,860
HA-HA, NO!

41
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,628
I WAS COLLECTING
PINE CONES.

42
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:11,030
AND I SAW THE GUYS
LINED UP DOWN AT THE DOCK.

43
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:13,633
WHY IS MOOSE THOMPSON
IN A THONG?

44
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,036
IT MAY BE A THONG NOW,

45
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:20,039
BUT WHEN HE PUT IT ON
IT WAS BERMUDA SHORTS.

46
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,775
THEY'RE ACTUALLY GETTING
READY FOR THE STRENGTH
COMPETITION.

47
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,344
THEY'VE GOTTA
LIFT THIS BOX --

48
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,979
I'M GONNA TAKE IT DOWN
TO THEM IN A MINUTE.

49
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:28,081
YOU SEE, THE WAY IT
WORKS IS THAT EACH
OF THE TWO LODGES

50
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:29,649
HAS TO PICK JUST ONE
GUY TO REPRESENT THEM.

51
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,351
SO WE HAVE TO
PICK OUR GUY.

52
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:32,986
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU DO IT LIKE THAT.

53
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,587
I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD
BE ABLE TO COMPETE.

54
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,322
YOU KNOW, THAT WAY GUYS
LIKE ME WOULD HAVE A CHANCE.

55
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,025
HAROLD, GUYS LIKE YOU
NEVER HAVE A CHANCE.

56
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,927
IF WE LET
EVERYBODY COMPETE,

57
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,662
WE WOULD NEED A
BIGGER HOSPITAL.

58
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,464
FINE. FINE.

59
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,132
MAYBE I SHOULD
TRY OUT, THOUGH,

60
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,767
BECAUSE THIS YEAR THEY'RE
LOOKING FOR STRENGTH, SPEED

61
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,035
AND INTELLIGENCE.

62
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,303
WHAT?

63
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,105
YEAH, THEY CHANGED
THE RULES.

64
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,308
YEAH, YOU NEED SOMEBODY WHO'S
STRONG, FAST AND SMART.

65
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,809
OH, BOY. OKAY.

66
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,144
OH, NO!
LET ME TRY.

67
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,379
LET ME TRY.
LET ME TRY.

68
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:00,647
OH, HAROLD,
REALLY?

69
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,617
MY HANDS ARE SWEATY.

70
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,352
THAT'S THE THING.
THEY'RE SWEATY.

71
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:10,056
I JUST GET A
LITTLE POWDER.

72
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:15,461
[coughing]

73
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,164
YOU ALL RIGHT?

74
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,067
YOU SHOULD BE GOOD
AT THIS, HAROLD.

75
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:24,370
"CLEAN" AND "JERK"
ARE YOUR MIDDLE NAMES.

76
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:28,675
THERE YOU GO.
HEY! HUH? HUH?

77
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:31,444
[laughter and applause]

78
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,148
OW-W-W!

79
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,183
THAT'S GOOD WORK.

80
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,185
BRING IT DOWN TO THE
DOCK SO I CAN PUT THE
WEIGHTS IN IT.

81
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,496
IT'S TIME FOR THE
POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

82
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:56,402
[laughter and applause]

83
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,939
TONIGHT'S WINNER
RECEIVES THIS COUPON

84
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:03,977
FOR A WHOLE WEEKEND
OF PONY RIDES...

85
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,580
IN A 1984 HYUNDAI PONY.

86
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,817
OFFER SUBJECT TO
AVAILABILITY OF TOW TRUCK.

87
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,086
OKAY, COVER YOUR
EARS THERE, MIKE.

88
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,787
RED, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS

89
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,589
TO GET MIKE HAMAR
TO SAY THIS WORD...

90
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,326
YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
WINSTON.

91
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,628
AND... GO!

92
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,363
OKAY, MIKE,
WHAT DO YOU HAVE

93
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,598
WHEN YOU HAVE
24 BOTTLES OF BEER?

94
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,934
BLURRED VISION?

95
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,838
OKAY. OKAY, MIKE,
WHEN YOU'RE IN TROUBLE,

96
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,706
THIS IS WHAT YOUR
LAWYER PLEADS.

97
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,708
TO PAY HIS FEE.

98
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,511
OKAY, YOU'RE
FAMILIAR WITH THESE.

99
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:39,846
IT'S CALLED AN
OPEN AND SHUT...

100
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,948
CASH REGISTER.

101
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,652
OKAY, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
MOST BUSINESS MEN HAVE,

102
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,420
A BRIEF...

103
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,355
AFFAIR?

104
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,825
OKAY, SAY THERE'S
A CRIME WAVE, OKAY,

105
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,461
AND THE POLICE CHIEF HAS
KIND OF A NEWS CONFERENCE,

106
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,430
HE'LL SAY MY BEST
DETECTIVES ARE ON THE...

107
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,998
TAKE.

108
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,436
YOU GUYS ARE ALMOST
OUT OF TIME HERE.

109
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,271
OKAY, MIKE, WHEN
YOU APPEAR IN COURT

110
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,373
WHAT DOES THE
BAILIFF ANNOUNCE?

111
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,611
UH, HE SAYS, HEY, EVERYBODY,
IT'S MIKE HAMAR AGAIN!

112
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,880
AND SOMETIMES
HE EVEN LAUGHS,

113
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,515
BUT THAT'S A
WORST-CASE SCENARIO.

114
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:18,418
THERE WE GO!

115
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:24,190
[quirky upbeat music]

116
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,426
WELCOME TO THE EXPERTS
PORTION OF THE PROGRAMME

117
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,695
THIS IS WHERE WE ADDRESS
THOSE THREE LITTLE WORDS

118
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,330
MEN FIND SO
HARD TO SAY...

119
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,732
audience: I DON'T KNOW! 

120
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,634
THAT'S TRUE,
ISN'T IT?

121
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,569
OKAY, TODAY'S LETTER
GOES AS FOLLOWS...

122
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:39,305
"DEAR EXPERTS,
I RECENTLY TURNED 18,

123
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,342
"AND I AM READY
TO BECOME A MAN."

124
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,677
I HOPE THIS IS
FROM A GUY.

125
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:51,984
OH, WOMEN DON'T COME TO YOU,
UNCLE RED, FOR ADVICE.

126
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,220
WOMEN DON'T COME TO YOU
FOR ANYTHING, HAROLD.

127
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,723
[laughter]

128
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,896
"DEAR EXPERTS --
TO MAKE MYSELF MORE MATURE

129
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,032
"I WANT TO GROW SOME
KIND OF FACIAL HAIR.

130
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,067
"UNFORTUNATELY, I CAN'T
DECIDE BETWEEN A BEARD,

135
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,578
"WHAT DO YOU THINK?"

136
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:20,580
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK

137
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,181
BECAUSE THAT'S A GREAT
WAY TO BE VIRILE.

138
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,217
TO ME, THERE'S
NOTHING MORE MANLY

139
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,786
THAN A FULL, THICK BEARD.

140
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:32,091
ESPECIALLY IF YOU
HAVE A FULL THICK HEAD.

141
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:36,195
[laughter and applause]

142
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,900
UH, YOU KNOW,
I'M WITH MR. GREEN
ON THIS ONE, HAROLD.

143
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:44,637
UH, LIKE, A BEARD CAN BE
A GREAT WAY TO ALTER
YOUR APPEARANCE.

144
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,807
AND THAT CAN
BE EXTREMELY USEFUL.

145
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,977
I JUST DON'T THINK
YOU HAVE TO GROW

146
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,678
ALL THESE WILD WHISKERS
ALL OVER YOUR FACE.

147
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,882
YOU KNOW, A SIMPLE, SUBTLE
MOUSTACHE WILL DO NICELY.

148
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,550
LIKE MINE.

149
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,754
YOU HAVE A
MOUSTACHE, HAROLD?

150
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,089
YES!

151
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:05,758
I'M JUST VERY
FAIR HAIRED.

152
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,927
THAT'S ALL. SEE?

153
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,799
THAT'S NOT A MOUSTACHE,
THAT'S MARMALADE.

154
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,370
THE POINT IS...

155
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,472
FACIAL HAIR HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH MAKING A MAN.

156
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,207
THIS VIEWER CAN
DO WHATEVER THEY LIKE.

157
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,242
THERE'S ALL SORTS OF BEARD
CHOICES TO BE HAD OUT THERE.

158
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,011
JUST LOOK AT ANY
STYLE MAGAZINE.

159
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:26,712
OR IF YOU WANT A
BEARD LIKE HAROLD'S,

160
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,882
LOOK IN THE JAMS
AND JELLIES SECTION.

161
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:33,219
[applause]

162
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,188
HAVE YOU REACHED
THAT POINT IN YOUR LIFE

163
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:37,557
WHEN YOU REALISE THAT
YOU'RE NOT ALL THAT SPECIAL?

164
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,027
OR MORE IMPORTANTLY,
HAS YOUR WIFE REALISED IT?

165
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:42,962
WELL, TODAY I'M
GOING TO SHOW YOU

166
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,997
HOW TO GET THE ATTENTION AND
RESPECT OF YOUR NEIGHBOURS.

167
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,699
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
THEY'VE MET YOU.

168
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,067
BUT, HEY,
THAT'S NOT MY FAULT.

169
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,136
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU
LOOK AT PICTURES

170
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,938
OF FANCY HOUSES
IN THESE MAGAZINES

171
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,573
THEN TAKE A LOOK
AT YOUR OWN HOUSE?

172
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,041
NOTICE A DIFFERENCE?

173
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,742
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
THE NICE TREES

174
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,344
AND THE NO TARPS ON THE ROOF

175
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,813
AND THE LACK OF K-CARS
TURNED UPSIDE DOWN
ON THE FRONT LAWN.

176
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,316
I'M TALKING ABOUT THAT
FANCY GINGERBREAD TRIM

177
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,852
THEY HAVE ON THE EAVES OF SOME
OF THE NICE LOOKING HOUSES.

178
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:09,388
WOULDN'T YOUR HOUSE LOOK
GOOD WITH THAT KIND OF
TRIM ON IT?

179
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,290
OH, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING...

180
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,693
WHERE AM I GONNA
GET THE MONEY TO DO THAT?

181
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,461
OR HOW AM I GONNA
PULL THAT ONE OFF?

182
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,231
OR, HEY, WAIT A SEC,
I'M NOT EVEN MARRIED.

183
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,466
WELL, YOU KNOW, LIKE SO MANY
SO MANY THINGS IN LIFE

184
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,936
A LOT OF TIMES THE ANSWER'S
RIGHT IN YOUR OWN BACKYARD.

185
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,939
CHANCES ARE YOU'VE GOT A
BUNCH OF TOYS THAT YOU
DON'T USE ANY MORE

186
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,141
BECAUSE YOUR KIDS
HAVE GROWN UP AND GONE.

187
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,811
OR MAYBE YOUR GRANDFATHER
CHARGED THEM ALL ON
YOUR VISA CARD

188
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,013
BEFORE YOU HAD
HIM PICKED UP.

189
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,215
WELL, I'VE GOT SOME
GREAT NEWS FOR YOU

190
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:39,685
BECAUSE THIS ISN'T JUST JUNK
LYING AROUND YOUR YARD
ANY LONGER.

191
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,121
IN ABOUT ONE COAT
OF PAINT FROM NOW,

192
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,357
IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR
BEAUTIFULLY DECORATIVE

193
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,158
GINGERBREAD TRIM.

194
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,353
OKAY, NOW, IF YOU USE THAT
PAINTING TECHNIQUE

195
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,290
YOU MAY GET A LITTLE
OVERSPRAY THERE.

196
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,725
YOU'LL NEVER EVEN SEE
THAT ONCE THE SNOW FLIES.

197
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,131
NOW YOU JUST TAKE ALL YOUR
DECORATIVE ITEMS

198
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:26,766
AROUND TO THE FRONT LAWN,

199
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,167
YOUR SCONCES, YOUR FINIALS,
YOUR BRIC-A-BRAC,

200
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,635
WHATEVER.

201
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,671
THEN YOU JUST ATTACH
EVERYTHING TO YOUR EAVES

202
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:35,007
IN AN ARTISTIC, YET SUBTLY
SYMMETRIC PATTERN.

203
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,742
OH, YEAH,
ONE OTHER RULE...

204
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,911
INFLATABLE TOYS DON'T
LIKE STAPLE GUNS.

205
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,649
AND THERE WE GO.

206
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,384
BRING THE LADDER DOWN
SO WE GET A BETTER LOOK.

207
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,420
OOP! OH! OH!

208
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:49,889
YEAH, THAT'S GOT IT.

209
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,524
OKAY, NOW, WHAT DID
THAT COST US, EH?

210
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,259
A GALLON OF PAINT,
A BACK LAWN

211
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,760
AND A COUPLE OF
MUSCLE SPASMS.

212
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,228
WELL WORTH IT.

213
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,497
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

214
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,032
THEY SHOULD AT
LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

215
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,401
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
THIS PROJECT WILL
MAKE YOUR WIFE

216
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,070
FEEL PRETTY DARNED SPECIAL.

217
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,838
THE NEIGHBOURS ARE
REALLY GONNA NOTICE YOU NOW!

218
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:12,044
[applause]

219
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,384
[quirky upbeat music]

220
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,688
YOU EVER NOTICE THE
WAY MARRIED COUPLES DRESS

221
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,625
AFTER THE TEN-YEAR MARK
OF A MARRIAGE?

222
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,793
THE HUSBANDS
TEND TO DRESS, SAY,

223
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,962
A LITTLE MORE CASUALLY
THAN THE WIVES DO.

224
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,732
I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN MIDDLE
AGED COUPLES AT THE MALL,
AND SHE LOOKS GREAT.

225
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,368
GOT THE SHARP OUTFIT
WITH THE MATCHING PURSE;

226
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:39,538
HE'S WEARING TORN JEANS
AND A STAINED SWEATSHIRT,

227
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:42,108
BOTH OF WHICH FIT
HIM SEVERAL YEARS

228
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:45,578
AND HUNDREDS OF BIG MACS AGO.

229
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:48,848
I'LL TELL YOU REASON FOR
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
MEN AND WOMEN.

230
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:51,851
WOMEN CHOOSE CLOTHES BASED ON
HOW THEY MAKE THEM LOOK,

231
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:54,854
MEN CHOOSE CLOTHES BASED ON
HOW THEY MAKE THEM
 FEEL.
 

232
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,455
HUH? OH, YEAH.

233
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,624
SEE, MEN AREN'T THAT CONCERNED
WITH THEIR APPEARANCE,

234
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:02,094
MARRIED MEN EVEN LESS SO.

235
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,963
WHENEVER YOU SEE
A DRESS CODE, YOU KNOW,

236
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,498
AT A FUNCTION
OR AT A CLUB,

237
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,900
THAT'S FOR MARRIED MEN,
BELIEVE ME.

238
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:11,704
SEE, THE SINGLE MEN ARE STILL
MAKING THE SALES PRESENTATION.

239
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,739
MARRIED MEN HAVE
ALREADY CLOSED THE DEAL.

240
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,341
THEY'RE JUST TRYING
TO HONOUR THE CONTRACT

241
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,177
WITHOUT LOSING
ALL THEIR DIGNITY.

242
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,246
BUT YOU LADIES
BE CAREFUL OUT THERE,

243
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,381
'CAUSE EVERY MAN
WANTS SOMETHING.

244
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,017
THE BETTER HE'S DRESSED
THE MORE HE WANTS.

245
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,019
A MIDDLE AGED MARRIED GUY,

246
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,821
ALL HE WANTS IS
TO BE LEFT ALONE.

247
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,489
SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

248
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:32,324
WHEN HE'S WEARING THE RATTY
SWEATSHIRT AND TORN JEANS,

249
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,960
HECK, HE'S DRESSED
FOR SUCCESS.

250
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:36,595
REMEMBER,
I'M PULLING FOR YOU,

251
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:38,431
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

252
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,666
[applause]

253
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,836
PROPANE HEATS HOUSES
FOR COUNTRY FOLK.

254
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,272
BUTANE IS USED TO
LIGHT UP YOUR SMOKE.

255
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,474
METHANE'S A GAS
WHO'S NOT UNDERSTOOD,

256
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:51,577
BUT YOU CAN TELL BY THE SMELL
HE'S UP TO NO GOOD.

257
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:04,924
HAROLD!

258
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,260
HAROLD, CONGRATULATIONS.

259
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,197
PARDON?

260
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,898
CONGRATULATIONS.

261
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:15,334
YOU WON THE
QUALIFYING FOOT RACE.

262
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,404
I JUST THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE CHASING ME AGAIN.

263
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:23,075
NO. YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS?

264
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,611
THAT MEANS YOU'RE NUMBER ONE
IN THE SPEED CATEGORY.

265
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:29,048
OH! OH! HOW DID
I DO WITH STRENGTH?

266
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:32,384
YOU'RE NUMBER ONE
IN THE SPEED CATEGORY.

267
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,553
OKAY. WELL, HOW
ABOUT INTELLIGENCE?

268
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,455
WE DON'T HAVE THOSE
RESULTS BACK YET.

269
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,491
NOBODY EXPECTED YOU TO
ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS.

270
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,993
YOU'RE DRIVING THE
JUDGES CRAZY WITH THAT.

271
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,962
HEY, RED,
GOT THE RESULTS

272
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,597
OF THE INTELLIGENCE
PORTION.

273
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,265
AND HERE'S A SHOCKER...

274
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,667
I'M NOT AS STUPID
AS ANN MARIE SAYS I AM.

275
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,870
OH, SURE YOU ARE.

276
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,273
OH, MY GOSH.

277
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:57,309
HAROLD, YOU CAME
IN FIRST IN SPEED,

278
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,011
AND FIRST IN INTELLIGENCE.

279
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,313
OH! EXCELLENT!
OH, YES!

280
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:05,785
AND 157th IN STRENGTH,

281
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:09,588
JUST AHEAD OF
OLD MAN SEDGWICK.

282
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,323
WELL, ACTUALLY
OLD MAN SEDWICK BEAT HIM,

283
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,925
BUT HE FAILED
THE URINE TEST

284
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,828
BECAUSE HE COULDN'T
PRODUCE A SAMPLE.

285
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,201
PROSTATE?

286
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,637
NO, JUST STINGY.

287
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,539
WELL, IT DOESN'T
MATTER, DALTON.

288
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,174
I CAME IN
FIRST OVERALL,

289
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,009
SO I'M GONNA
REPRESENT POSSUM LODGE

290
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,410
IN THE MR. POSSUM LAKE
COMPETITION.

291
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,279
W-WAIT A MINUTE,
HAROLD.

292
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,014
DID YOU TURN IN
A URINE SAMPLE?

293
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,349
NO, HE JUST GAVE
THEM HIS MATTRESS.

294
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,658
Red [voiceover]:
WALTER WANTED TO FLY 
HIS LITTLE MODEL AIRPLANE, 

295
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,560
SO I CAME OUT TO 
HELP HIM ON THAT.
 
 

296
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,295
AND HE'S ALL 
EXCITED ABOUT IT.
 

297
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:50,996
IT'S THE OLD, THEY CALL 
THEM SPITFIRE OR SOMETHING,
 

298
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,331
FLYING TIGER OR SOMETHING. 

299
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,800
OKAY, WALTER, 
WE GET IT.
 

300
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,736
YOU KNOW, SAD TO SEE 
HIM GO LIKE THAT. 

301
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,572
SO I WAS GONNA 
START HER UP THERE,
 

302
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,440
THE LITTLE 049, 
GOT HERE GOING.
 

303
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,576
AND THE PROBLEM WITH THESE, 
I ALWAYS FIND,
 

304
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,277
IS PEOPLE GET DIZZY 
WHEN THEY'RE RUNNING.  

305
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,012
AND WALTER WAS 
NO EXCEPTION.
 

306
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,148
YOU GET SPINNING THERE 
BECAUSE YOU GOTTA MOVE 
YOUR FEET AROUND. 

307
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,917
OKAY. THEN HE 
STARTS LOSING IT.
 

308
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:15,254
NOW THE PLANE'S 
COMING AFTER ME.
 

309
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,089
SO I HEAD FOR THE SHED, 

310
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,258
AND IT JUST KNOCKED 
THE GARBAGE CAN LID THERE.  

311
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,893
KIND OF SPLIT THE 
LID A LITTLE BIT.
 

312
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,528
SO WE NEED 
ANOTHER PLAN HERE. 

313
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,330
FIRST WE GOTTA FIND THE -- 
THE PLANE ACTUALLY WENT 

314
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,965
INTO THE GARBAGE CAN. 

315
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,600
BUT I SAW THE LID THERE, 
AND IT GAVE ME AN IDEA.
 

316
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,468
I THOUGHT, OKAY, YOU SPLIT 
HER THERE WITH THE PROP, 

317
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,237
BUT IF WE PUT THAT 
BACK TOGETHER AGAIN, 

318
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:34,640
AND I'M THINKING IF YOU 
ACTUALLY STOOD ON THE LID,  

319
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,742
AND THAT WOULD KIND OF SPIN 
AROUND ON THE GROUND,   

320
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,577
MAYBE HE WOULDN'T 
GET SO DIZZY,
 

321
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,145
BECAUSE HE'S NOT TURNING. 

322
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,014
SEE, THE THING IS JUST STAND 
THERE AND JUST -- 

323
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,782
LIKE I SAY, 
IT WAS ONLY A THEORY.
 

324
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,518
SO WE GET WALTER 
ON THERE AND, UH --
 

325
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,721
YOU KNOW, IN HINDSIGHT, 
I PROBABLY SHOULD'VE
 

326
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:51,223
DUCT TAPED OVER THE SPLIT 
THAT WAS THERE FROM THE PROP.
 

327
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,125
ANYWAY, I GOT HER GOING.  

328
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,894
AND I -- 
IT STARTED TO WORK,
 

329
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,695
AND HE STARTED TO SWING 
AROUND NICELY ON IT.
 

330
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:58,530
BUT THEN THE SPLIT OPENED 
AND SHE STARTS TO --
 

331
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,599
HE STARTS TO AUGUR 
HIMSELF INTO THE GROUND. 

332
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:05,738
AND IT'S GETTING REAL LOW 
AND GETTING RIDICULOUS NOW.
 

333
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:08,841
I GOTTA ACTUALLY 
JUMP OVER THE PLANE. 

334
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,011
AND THEN HE BINDS UP -- 
NOW WE GOT A REAL PROBLEM. 

335
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,013
AND THEN THE PLANE 
TURNS AND HEADS FOR HIM. 

336
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:20,352
SEE, NOT ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE 
A MEAL ON A FLIGHT, I FIND.
 

337
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:24,189
[applause]

338
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,071
I'LL TELL YOU, THE WORST PART
OF PART OF CUTTING YOUR LAWN

339
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,574
IS HAVING TO MOW AROUND TREES
OR CORNERS LIKE THIS ONE.

340
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:45,177
OKAY, I SUPPOSE YOU COULD GET
ONE OF THOSE WEED WHACKERS,

341
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,613
IF YOU'RE MADE OF MONEY.

342
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,615
OR YOU COULD HAVE
A BRUSH FIRE,

343
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,350
BUT YOU'D HAVE TO
BE ON MUCH BETTER TERMS

344
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,886
WITH YOUR LOCAL FIRE
DEPARTMENT THAN I AM.

345
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,889
BUT AS ALWAYS, I'VE COME UP
WITH A SOLUTION THAT'S
AFFORDABLE,

346
00:15:56,922 --> 00:16:00,659
AND -- WELL, LET'S JUST
STAY WITH AFFORDABLE.

347
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,661
THESE HERE ARE
CARPET REMNANTS --

348
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,930
YOU KNOW THOSE LITTLE BITS
AND PIECES OF CARPETING

349
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:07,066
YOU HAD LEFT OVER WHEN
YOU DECIDED TO REFINISH

350
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,001
THE HARDWOOD FLOORS YOURSELF,

351
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:11,036
AND THEN REALISED THE
ONLY WAY OUT OF THAT MESS

352
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,439
WAS TO COVER EVERYTHING
IN THE WALL TO WALL?

353
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:16,108
WELL, NOW YOU CAN USE
ALL THESE LITTLE CHUNKS

354
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,344
YOU STOPPED YOUR WIFE
FROM THROWING AWAY.

355
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,447
ALL'S YOU HAVE TO DO IS
PAINT THEM TO MATCH
YOUR LAWN DECOR.

356
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,952
NOW, THAT'S WHAT
I CALL CUTTING CORNERS.

357
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:31,190
YOU CAN ALSO PUT
THESE BABIES TO WORK

358
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,559
SO YOU NEVER HAVE TO TRIM
AROUND TREE TRUNKS AGAIN.

359
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,564
EVEN IF YOU HATE DANCING
YOU CAN STILL CUT A RUG.

360
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,866
GOOD THING YOU
DON'T HATE CHEESE.

361
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,907
DON'T WORRY.
IT'S SCOTCH-GUARDED.

362
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:51,377
[applause]

363
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:57,649
Mike:
I'M HAVING A LOT OF TROUBLE
FINDING THE RIGHT WOMAN.

364
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,252
Red:
WELL, SHE'S NOT HERE.

365
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,321
Dalton: YOU KNOW, MIKE,

366
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:05,057
SOMETIMES THE WRONG WOMAN
CAN BE A LOT MORE FUN.

367
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,895
Mike: I'M TALKING
ABOUT THE REAL THING,

368
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,930
A LASTING RELATIONSHIP.

369
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,566
I WANNA BE MARRIED,
JUST LIKE MY MOTHER --

370
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,702
EXCEPT JUST
ONCE AT A TIME.

371
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,504
AND BY A REAL MINISTER,

372
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,340
NOT JUST A GUY WITH
A LIQUOR LICENSE.

373
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,043
Red: WELL, YOU KNOW, WE CAN
PROBABLY HELP YOU THERE,

374
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,478
BECAUSE DALTON AND I HAVE
BEEN MARRIED QUITE A WHILE.

375
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,213
Dalton: OH, YEAH.

376
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,982
Red:
I'M SURE WE COULD ANSWER ANY
QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE.

377
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,985
Mike:
GREAT! OH, YEAH.

378
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,188
OKAY, UM...

379
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,892
I DON'T
UNDERSTAND WOMEN.

380
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:46,265
LIKE, WHEN I'M IN
A RELATIONSHIP,

381
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,333
I ONLY THINK OF ONE
THING AT A TIME, RIGHT,

382
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,470
BUT THE WOMAN, SHE THINKS OF
EVERYTHING ALL AT ONCE.

383
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,872
IT'S EXHAUSTING.

384
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:57,242
Dalton:
YOU KNOW, MIKE, A MAN'S MIND

385
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:00,012
IS A LOT LIKE A NET.

386
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,249
YOU KNOW, HE'LL GO
THROUGH A LOT OF INFORMATION

387
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:07,319
AND HE'LL FILTER
OUT WHAT HE WANTS,

388
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:11,256
AND THAT IS WHAT
HE HANGS ON TO.

389
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:16,228
Red: BUT A WOMAN'S MIND
IS LIKE A -- LIKE --

390
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,297
WELL, IT'S LIKE
A BUCKET, EH?

391
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,165
AND WHEN SHE GOES
THROUGH THE INFORMATION,

392
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,601
SHE GATHERS UP EVERY
LITTLE BIT OF IT.

393
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,436
AND IF THE DAY EVER COMES

394
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,305
WHEN YOU'VE FORGOTTEN
SOME OF THAT INFORMATION,

395
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,841
WELL, SHE'S ONLY TOO HAPPY
TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY.

396
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:34,513
Mike:
SO, LIKE, YOU'RE SAYING A
MAN'S MIND IS LIKE A SIEVE.

397
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,281
Dalton:
NO, NO, LIKE A NET.

398
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,050
Red:
LIKE A NET.

399
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:42,121
A MAN WILL GO THROUGH A
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF
INFORMATION --

400
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:45,824
Mike:
AND COME UP WITH NOTHING.

401
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,093
[sigh]
OKAY, MIKE, LOOK.

402
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,296
THE MAN IS -- IS --
IS THE ANCHOR --

403
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:52,831
THE ANCHOR.

404
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,533
Dalton:
IN THE MARRIAGE.

405
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,101
WITHOUT THE ANCHOR
THERE IS NO MARRIAGE.

406
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,070
THERE'S
NO MARRIAGE.

407
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,105
Dalton: WITHOUT AN
ANCHOR, YOU ARE SUNK.

408
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,708
OH, GEEZ!
OH!

409
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,244
LUCKILY THERE'S A WOMAN
THERE TO BAIL US OUT.

410
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,546
[applause]

411
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,252
WELL, THIS WAS HAROLD'S
BIG DAY REPRESENTING
POSSUM LODGE

412
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,421
IN THE MR. POSSUM LAKE
COMPETITION AGAINST
CARIBOU LODGE.

413
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,223
I COULDN'T GO.

414
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,958
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO
PUT THE PRESSURE ON HIM.

415
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,827
DIDN'T WANNA
WATCH HIM LOSE,

416
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,329
AND IF HE WINS, THAT WOULD
PROBABLY EVEN BE UGLIER.

417
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,099
UNCLE RED! UNCLE RED!

418
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,634
OH, HAVE I GOT
NEWS FOR YOU.

419
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,035
WHAT A SURPRISE.

420
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,570
WHAT IS IT,
AS IF I DIDN'T KNOW.

421
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,238
I FOUND THE
PERFECT PINE CONE.

422
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,207
WHAT?

423
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,009
WHAT ARE TALKING
ABOUT, HAROLD?

424
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,677
QUIT KIDDING AROUND.

425
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,245
I'M NOT! LOOK AT IT.
THE SHAPE, THE COLOUR.

426
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,014
THERE'S SO MANY THINGS
YOU CAN DO WITH A PINE CONE.

427
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:44,850
I'M THINKING OF ONE
RIGHT NOW, HAROLD.

428
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,252
DID YOU WIN THE
MR. POSSUM LAKE
COMPETITION?

429
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,022
OH, THAT... NO.

430
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:52,124
WELL, HAROLD, THERE
WERE ONLY TWO OF YOU.

431
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,792
YOU MUST HAVE
WON SOMETHING.

432
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,227
OKAY, LET ME SEE.

433
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,895
IN STRENGTH
I CAME IN SECOND.

434
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,097
AND THEN THERE WAS SPEED.
I GOT THE SILVER IN THAT.

435
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,766
THEN THERE WAS THE
INTELLIGENCE COMPETITION,

436
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,401
AND THE PERSON
FROM CARIBOU LODGE,

437
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,670
THEY CAME IN SECOND LAST.

438
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,338
SO YOU LOST IN ALL
THREE CATEGORIES?

439
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,207
VERY MUCH SO, YES.

440
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,242
BUT I'M OKAY
WITH THAT, YOU KNOW?

441
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,044
YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO HAVE PRESENT

442
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,979
THE MR. POSSUM LAKE TROPHY AT
THE LODGE MEETING TONIGHT.

443
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,148
THIS IS HUMILIATING,
YOU KNOW THAT?

444
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,183
WE DIDN'T PICK YOU
BECAUSE WE WANTED
TO LOSE.

445
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,152
OH, I KNOW.
I KNOW. I KNOW.

446
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,855
IF YOU WANTED TO LOSE,
YOU WOULD'VE GONE IN YOURSELF.

447
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,591
[possum squealing]

448
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,226
OH, MEETING TIME.

449
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,461
YOU GO AHEAD.
I'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.

450
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,530
OKAY.
I'M FAST!

451
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,467
WELL, IF MY
WIFE IS WATCHING,

452
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,169
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

453
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,671
I WAS HOPING MAYBE WE COULD
PLAY A GAME OF CARDS OR CHESS

454
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,474
OR ANYTHING WHERE YOU
CAN JUST LET ME WIN
WOULD BE GREAT.

455
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,377
MAYBE A BELCHING CONTEST.

456
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:48,914
I CAN WIN THAT UNLESS
