1
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:04,437
THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN
ACCIDENTLY NAILING AN ANIMAL

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,473
WHEN YOU'RE OUT DRIVING
IN YOUR VEHICLE.

3
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:09,709
THE GRIEF YOU TAKE FROM THE WIFE
AND THE GREENPEACERS.

4
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:11,611
IT'S EVEN WORSE IF YOU'VE
GOT THE KIDS ON BOARD.

5
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,214
THEY GET SOBBING AND YOU'VE GOT
TO MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,450
YOU SAY: DON'T WORRY
THERE'S A SPECIAL SKUNK HEAVEN.

7
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,753
AND IT SMELLS LIKE
WE'RE NOT IN IT.

8
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:23,223
THE WORST PART IS SCRAPING ALL
THE GUNK OFF THE FRONT
OF YOUR CAR.

9
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:24,758
SO I GOT TO THINKING.

10
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:27,560
I PRE-SPRAY THE BARBEQUE
BEFORE I COOK DEAD ANIMALS,

11
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:31,297
WHY NOT DO THE SAME THING
WITH THE VAN?

12
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,768
OH YEAH, EVEN BUGS
FLY RIGHT OFF HERE.

13
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:37,604
YOU COULD T-BONE A MOOSE
AND AS LONG AS YOU DUCK
THE ANTLERS,

14
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,773
YOU CAN KEEP RIGHT ON TRUCKING.

15
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,443
IT'S THE RED GREEN SHOW.

16
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:48,648
AND NOW HERE'S A MAN WHO HAS
NO QUALMS ABOUT USING
THE WORD QUALM,

17
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,183
YOUR HOST AND HERO,
AND MY UNCLE:

18
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,520
RED GRE-E-E-N!!!

19
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,831
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
APPRECIATE IT.

20
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,933
BIG, BIG NEWS
UP AT THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,202
ACTUALLY, IN THE NEWS, YES SIR.

22
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:13,673
POSSUM LODGE MADE THE FRONT PAGE
OF THE PORT ASBESTOS
DAILY MOVEMENT.

23
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,642
A REPORTER WAS HERE YESTERDAY,

24
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:19,546
KIND OF SNOOPING AROUND,
SNAPPING PHOTOS AND
DOING INTERVIEWS,

25
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:22,282
IT WAS PRETTY EXCITING STUFF.

26
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:24,651
I THINK YOU HAVE TO LEARN
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
GOOD PRESS AND BAD PRESS.

27
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:28,021
THAT REPORTER WASN'T
UP HERE DOING A PLEASANT
HUMAN INTEREST STORY.

28
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,623
OH NO?
OH NO!

29
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,226
HE WAS ASKING LODGE MEMBERS
SOME PRETTY TOUGH QUESTIONS.

30
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,862
ABOUT THE FLOATING FURNITURE
OUT ON THE LAKE, THERE.

31
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,264
ALL THE PETROLEUM STAINS
ON THE GROUND.

32
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:43,403
WHY IS THAT SNOWMOBILE PILE
SMOULDERING LIKE THAT?

33
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,307
YOU WOULD KNOW THESE THINGS
IF YOU DIDN'T LOCK YOURSELF
IN THE POSSUM VAN.

34
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,375
NONE OF THAT STUFF
MATTERS, HAROLD.

35
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,778
AS LONG AS THEY SPELL
OUR NAMES RIGHT.

36
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:54,347
DID YOU EVEN BOTHER
TO READ THE ARTICLE?

37
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,282
THE TOWN WANTS TO
DEMOLISH THE LODGE.

38
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:59,719
HAROLD, THEY PUT THOSE
SENSATIONAL HEADLINES
IN THERE LIKE...

39
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,589
"MAN MARRIES HIS
OWN SISTER."

40
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:05,225
THEN, YOU READ THE ARTICLE
AND THE GUY'S A MINISTER

41
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,261
AND HE MARRIED HIS SISTER
TO SOME OTHER GUY, YOU KNOW.

42
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,629
SEE, LOOK IT, LOOK IT.

43
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,297
THEY TRY TO MAKE
US LOOK WORSE.

44
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,199
RIGHT BESIDE
OUR ARTICLE,

45
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,869
THEY'VE GOT A PICTURE OF
A SCRAPYARD, FOR GOSH SAKES.

46
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:18,238
THAT'S AN AERIAL VIEW
OF THE LODGE.

47
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,845
TIME TO PLAY
"THE POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME"

48
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,481
AND TODAY, LOCAL ROOFER,
MR. ARNIE DOGAN, IS PLAYING

49
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:33,453
FOR A FANTASTIC PRIZE
OF AN ANT FARM.

50
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,558
AND THE BEST PART IS IT COMES
WITH A COLONY OF ANTS.

51
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,161
YOU CAN SEE THEM
INSIDE THERE.

52
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:45,365
YOU CAN'T SEE THEM NOW,
THEY MUST BE HIDING
OR CAMERA SHY.

53
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:53,473
BUT, THEY'RE ALL THERE.

54
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,978
[laughter]

55
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:00,613
UNCLE RED.

56
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,386
YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS TO GET
MR. ARNIE DOGAN TO SAY
THIS WORD:

57
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,459
GO!!!

58
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,295
ALL RIGHT, ARNIE,
SOMEONE YOU SEE A LOT.

59
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,430
THE AMBULANCE DRIVER.

60
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:20,934
AFTER WORK, YOU GO OUT
FOR A DRINK AND YOU TAKE A...?

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,336
NECK BRACE.

62
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,238
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE PERSON YOU'RE WITH.

63
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,774
OH, MY ORTHOPAEDIC SURGEON.

64
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,211
THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL
PERSON IN YOUR LIFE.

65
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:33,112
A KIDNEY DONOR.

66
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,848
NEVER LEAVES YOUR SIDE.

67
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:39,152
MY I.V. BAG.

68
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,287
ALWAYS THERE FOR YA, BUDDY.

69
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,956
OH, BED PAN.

70
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:45,625
ALMOST OUT OF TIME,
UNCLE RED.

71
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,294
CAN YOU GET YOUR MIND
OFF THE DOCTORS AND
HOSPITAL EQUIPMENT?

72
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:51,197
HEY RED, THE MEDICAL PROFESSION
IS THE BEST FRIEND I EVER HAD.

73
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:54,834
[bell ringing]

74
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,275
BAD PRESS WILL KILL YA,
I'M TELLING YA.

75
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,444
THE TOWN COUNCIL HAS GOT
A COURT ORDER THAT SAYS

76
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,946
IF WE DON'T CLEAN UP THE LODGE,
THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR IT DOWN.

77
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,549
ON TOP OF THAT, I'VE GOT THIS
WEIRD CULT THAT'S SHOWN UP

78
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,852
BECAUSE THEY LOOKED AT
THE PICTURE AND THEY SEE
A SACRED IMAGE OR SOMETHING,

79
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,520
I DON'T KNOW.

80
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,022
I MEAN, THEY'RE NUTS.

81
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,025
THEY WEAR STRIPED ROBES AND
SAY THEY'RE FROM OUTER SPACE.

82
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,827
SO, I SENT HAROLD OUT
TO TALK TO THEM.

83
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:25,565
[laughter]

84
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:28,935
I TALKED TO THEM,
I TALKED TO THEM.

85
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:32,205
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING,
BUT I DIDN'T JOIN THE CULT,
OR ANYTHING.

86
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,840
I'M INFILTRATING THEM.

87
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,074
YEAH, YEAH.

88
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,643
YEAH, I'M GAINING
THEIR CONFIDENCE.

89
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,745
YOU'RE LOSING
MINE, HAROLD.

90
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,546
THEY'RE REALLY COOL,
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY.

91
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,683
THEY SAY THEIR ANCESTORS
CAME HERE FROM THE PLANET
GORGON IN A DISTANT GALAXY.

92
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,619
YOU SURE IT WASN'T IN
A FORD GALAXY, HAROLD?

93
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,788
I BELIEVE THEM,
I BELIEVE THEM.

94
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,658
THEY SAY THEIR MOTHERSHIP
IS COMING BACK FOR THEM
REAL SOON, YOU KNOW,

95
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:54,961
AND THEY BELIEVE THAT
POSSUM LODGE IS THEIR
DEPARTURE LOUNGE.

96
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:58,865
HAROLD, COME ON,
THESE ARE NOT
RATIONAL PEOPLE.

97
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,567
THESE ARE WEIRDOS,
THESE ARE LOSERS.

98
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,636
YOU GO RIGHT
BACK OUT THERE

99
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:08,074
AND YOU TELL THEM THAT
THE LAST BUS FOR GORGON
LEFT ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO

100
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:15,048
AND MAYBE THEY SHOULD WARP
THEMSELVES UP TO PORT ASBESTOS
AND GET SOME DILITHEUM CRYSTALS.

101
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,884
YOU GO TELL THEM THAT.

102
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,952
THEY CALL YOU
"THE GRAND MASTER."

103
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,655
WHAT? PARDON ME?

104
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,791
THEY SAID BECAUSE YOU'RE
THE LODGE LEADER,

105
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:27,694
YOU MUST BE ALL KNOWING,
ALL POWERFUL AND ALL SEEING.

106
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,430
THEY'LL DO YOUR BIDDING,
YOU'RE THE "GRAND MASTER."

107
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:35,268
SHOULDN'T YOU BE BOWING
WHEN YOU SPEAK TO ME?

108
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,072
OH YEAH, SORRY,
"GRAND MASTER."

109
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:40,807
I'LL GO TALK TO THEM.

110
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,776
HAROLD, EITHER DO
THE BACK UP OR PUT
SOME PANTS ON.

111
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,017
OH, THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE
HAD A RACE ONE DAY 

112
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,686
TO SEE IF SLOW COULD
EVER BEAT FAST 

113
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,222
THEY WERE NECK AND NECK
'TIL THE TRUCK WENT BY 

114
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,391
AND THEY BOTH
ENDED UP DEAD LAST 

115
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:12,004
THIS MAY LOOK LIKE FUN
TO SOME OF YOU YOUNGSTERS,

116
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,474
BUT, AS YOU GET OLDER,

117
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:20,780
THE IDEA OF SPENDING A SATURDAY
TRYING TO PULL START THE OLD
LAWN MOWER WEARS A LITTLE THIN.

118
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:24,217
[crashing sounds]

119
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:28,955
THE BEST SOLUTION, OF COURSE,
IS TO GET ONE OF THOSE
NEW FANGLED RIDING MOWERS

120
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:33,025
WITH THE ELECTRIC START AND
EIGHT GEARS ON HER BIG,
WIDE MOWER BED.

121
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,762
BUT THOSE BABIES WILL COST YOU
OVER A THOUSAND BUCKS.

122
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:42,735
HOW DOES THAT COMPARE WITH
PICKING UP A PREVIOUSLY ENJOYED
FULL SIZE AUTOMOBILE FOR $100.

123
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,904
OKAY, THIS PONTIAC MAY 
NOT BE STREET LEGAL, 

124
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,707
BUT, HEY, NEITHER IS
THE RIDING MOWER.

125
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,009
THINK OF THE FEATURES.

126
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,644
YOU GOT A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD,

127
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,079
YOU GOT A RADIO, YOU GOT HEAT,

128
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,714
YOU GOT AIR CONDITIONING,

129
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,215
AND WHILE YOU'RE
CUTTING THE LAWN,

130
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,950
YOU CAN EVEN HAVE
SOME PASSENGERS,

131
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,520
AS LONG AS THEY HAVE
A HIGH BOREDOM THRESHOLD.

132
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,623
I'D RATHER SPEND A FEW BUCKS
TURNING THIS BABY INTO
A RIDING MOWER,

133
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:06,192
THAN TO TAKE ONE
RIGHT OFF THE LOT.

134
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:12,632
ALL I HAVE TO ADD IS
SOME KIND OF ROTATING BLADE.

135
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:18,237
[crashing noises]

136
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,440
HOW ABOUT A CEILING FAN?

137
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,842
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY A NEW ONE,

138
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,645
JUST WAIT 'TIL A TALL GUY
HAS A GARAGE SALE.

139
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,380
HE'LL BE UNLOADING ONE OF THESE

140
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,015
AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET
A GOOD DEAL ON IT,

141
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,050
ESPECIALLY IF HE'S WEARING
A HEAD BANDAGE.

142
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,453
ALL WE'VE GOT TO DO IS
CUSTOMIZE THESE FAN BLADES,

143
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,488
SO THAT THEY REALLY ARE BLADES.

144
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:39,258
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS ATTACH
SOME KNIVES TO THE FRONT EDGE
OF THE BLADE USING

145
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,327
THE "HANDYMAN'S SECRET WEAPON"

146
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,229
DUCT TAPE.

147
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,832
I THINK THESE KNIVES ARE
THE KIND YOU SEE ON T.V.

148
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:48,267
WHERE THEY CUT THE TOMATOES
AND THE TIN CANS,

149
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,470
AND THAT'S GREAT 'CAUSE I HAVE
A LOT OF THOSE ON MY LAWN.

150
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:56,442
YOU WANT TO ATTACH THIS UNIT TO
THE UNDERSIDE OF YOUR VEHICLE.

151
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,011
YOU MIGHT WANT TO STAY AWAY
FROM THE DRIVE SHAFT.

152
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:02,381
NO SENSE DOING
ANYTHING DANGEROUS.

153
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:05,685
THEN, ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO
IS HOOK UP THE POWER.

154
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:11,390
NOW, THE PROBLEM THERE IS
THE FAN IS A 110-VOLT UNIT
AND THE CAR IS ONLY A 12-VOLT.

155
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:16,629
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA NEED IS
A SPECIAL LITTLE GIZMO
I'VE GOT INSIDE.

156
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,865
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
ONE OF THESE THINGS?

157
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,733
IT'S ONE OF THOSE
POWER ADAPTER THINGS,

158
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,836
SO, YOU CAN RUN YOUR CDS
AND WALKMANS AND STUFF
INSIDE YOUR HOUSE.

159
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:27,540
WHAT THIS DOES IS IT CONVERTS
110 VOLTS INTO 12 VOLTS.

160
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:33,713
SO, IF YOU HOOK IT UP BACKWARDS,
IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO TURN
12 VOLTS INTO 110.

161
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,415
THAT'S THE KIND IF THINKING
THAT MAKES ME WHAT I AM.

162
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,020
AND HERE'S A NIFTY
LITTLE WRINKLE,

163
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:44,457
I'M ACTUALLY TAKING
MY POWER SUPPLY OFF THE BACK
OF THE BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH,

164
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,360
SO, THE FAN DOESN'T GET ANY
POWER UNTIL THE BRAKE IS OFF.

165
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,795
AS SOON AS YOU STEP
ON THE BRAKE PEDAL,

166
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,330
THE FAN STOPS AUTOMATICALLY.

167
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,933
TALK ABOUT SAFETY.

168
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,035
AND GOLLY, YOU KNOW,
FOR LESS THAN 150 BUCKS,

169
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,638
WE'VE MADE A CUSTOMIZED,
CLIMATE CONTROLLED,

170
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,440
EXTRA WIDE, RIDING LAWN MOWER.

171
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,409
WE GOT HEAD LIGHTS ON 'ER
AND WE GOT WINDSHIELD WIPERS.

172
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:08,981
IT COULD RAIN DURING AN ECLIPSE
AND WE'D STILL GET THE LAWN CUT.

173
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:13,452
AND THAT, MY FRIEND,
IS HOW YOU TURN A PONTIAC
INTO A "LAWNDIAC."

174
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,621
A "LAWNDIAC."

175
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,390
HA! HA!

176
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,458
SO, REMEMBER...

177
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,527
" IF THE WOMEN DON'T
FIND YOU HANDSOME...

178
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:26,165
[engine choking]

179
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:39,545
[engine starting]

180
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:43,683
...THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY."

181
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:50,957
[laughter and applause]

182
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,864
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU OLDER GUYS
WHO MAY NOTICE SIGNS OF AGING

183
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,267
WHEN YOU GO BY
THE BATHROOM MIRROR

184
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,202
OR WHEN YOU'RE LOVED ONE SAYS:

185
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,205
"BOY, YOU'VE REALLY LET
YOURSELF GO, HAVEN'T YOU?"

186
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,341
THAT'S WHEN YOU TELL YOURSELF,

187
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,410
I'VE GOT TO START EATING RIGHT
AND START EXERCISING.

188
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:14,614
IT'S GOING TO BE ROUGH,
BUT I GUARANTEE YOU,

189
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,516
YOU GET ON TO A HEALTHY DIET
AND A VIGOROUS EXERCISE PROGRAM

190
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,286
AND BY THE END OF THREE DAYS,
A WEEK AT THE MOST,

191
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:24,557
YOU'LL REALIZE:
IT'S NOT WORTH IT!

192
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,293
BUT, THAT'S OKAY.

193
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,328
SEE, YOUR BODY IS YOUR HOME.

194
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,632
IF YOU'RE HOME SUITS YOU,
WHY RENOVATE?

195
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:36,302
SO WHAT, IF THE FOUNDATION
IS SETTLING,

196
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:39,205
OR MAYBE THE ROOF IS SAGGING.

197
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:43,242
OKAY, THE WIRING BLOWS A FUSE
EVERY NOW AND THEN, HUH?

198
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,177
ALL RIGHT, MAYBE YOUR PIPES
ARE ALL CLOGGED UP,

199
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,812
BUT AS LONG AS YOU STILL
GET A TRICKLE,

200
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,082
THAT'S ALL YOU REALLY NEED.

201
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,019
YOU'RE NOT A BROKEN DOWN HOVEL.

202
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:57,323
WHY, YOU'RE A CHARMING HOME
WITH CHARACTER AND HISTORY.

203
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:02,428
OH, YOUR WIFE MAY NOT LOVE
THE CREAKS AND GROANS EVERY
TIME THE WIND SHIFTS,

204
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:08,234
BUT AS LONG AS SHE CAN LIGHT
A FIRE AND CURL UP IN THE
WARMTH, SHE'LL BE FINE.

205
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,905
YEAH, YEAH, SHE MAY DROOL OVER
THE NEW DREAM HOMES SHE SEES
IN THE MAGAZINES,

206
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:17,810
BUT I BET SHE'LL NEVER MOVE
FROM THAT COSY LITTLE BUNGALOW
SHE MARRIED.

207
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,112
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YA.

208
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,248
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

209
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:29,522
[applause]

210
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:35,561
[laughter]

211
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,678
WHAT IS THAT, HAROLD?

212
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,481
THAT WAS A SEMIPHOR
FOR LIGHTEN UP,

213
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,283
YOU'RE TAKING THIS
WAY TOO SERIOUSLY.

214
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:00,586
WELL, I'VE GOT A LOT OF
RESPONSIBILITY HERE, HAROLD.

215
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,222
I GOTTA GET MY PEOPLE
BACK TO GORGON

216
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:06,826
AND I'VE GOT TO PREVENT
THE LODGE FROM BEING DEMOLISHED,

217
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,794
BUT IF YOU'RE SAYING
I'M TAKING IT TOO SERIOUSLY...

218
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,596
THEY'RE NOT GOING BACK
TO THE PLANET GORGON.

219
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,198
YOU KNOW THAT.

220
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,100
YOU'RE JUST
TAKING ADVANTAGE
OF THESE PEOPLE.

221
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,268
THAT'S WHY I'M
THE GRAND MASTER

222
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:19,972
AND YOU'RE JUST A GUY
IN A STRIPED BAG.

223
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:24,477
I TOLD THEM TO CLEAR
THE WHOLE AREA AROUND
THE LODGE

224
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:28,881
TO USE AS A LAUNCHING PAD
FOR THE MOTHERSHIP.

225
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,649
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE
THE LODGE CLEANED UP

226
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:33,419
AND THE TOWN OFF
MY BACK IN NO TIME.

227
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:36,622
DON'T YOU JUST THINK
YOU ARE SO CLEVER?

228
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:42,228
I DON'T THINK
THE GRAND MASTER
APPRECIATES THAT TONE.

229
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,563
SHOULDN'T YOU BE OUTSIDE
WITH THE OTHER GORGONITES

230
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,265
PITCHING IN AND
CLEANING UP HERE.

231
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,100
I'M NOT A GORGONITE
AND I'M NOT A SLAVE.

232
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,935
I'M MY OWN PERSON
AND YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

233
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,804
I QUIT.

234
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:54,640
I DON'T HAVE TO DO
ANY OF THAT STUFF

235
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:58,344
BECAUSE I'M AN INDIVIDUAL
AND I CAN THINK FOR MYSELF,

236
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,012
IF THAT'S OKAY
WITH EVERYBODY.

237
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,983
AS YOU KNOW,
IT'S NEW MEMBER NIGHT

238
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,851
AND EDGAR MONTROSE
HAS BROUGHT A FELLOW,

239
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:08,487
HE WANTS TO PRESENT
AS A NEW MEMBER.

240
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:11,223
LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER FLOAT
IN A PARADE OF WANNABES.

241
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:15,194
[laughter]

242
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,663
AH, THANKS, RED.

243
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:23,302
THIS GUY I'M PRESENTING
FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION
IS A REAL GOOD GUY.

244
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:30,543
A FRIEND OF MINE,
MY PAL, STAN...

245
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:33,212
SOMETHING OR OTHER.

246
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,416
I WAS UP AT STAN'S PLACE
DOING A LITTLE DYNAMITE WORK

247
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:43,088
ON A RUSTED OUT OLD LINCOLN
THAT WAS TAKING A LITTLE
TOO LONG TO EVAPORATE.

248
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,824
OH, BY THE WAY,

249
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,660
IF ANY OF YOU EVER TRY
TO LAUNCH A TOWN CAR
INTO THE LAKE,

250
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,895
THE TRUNK LID CAN FLY OPEN,

251
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:54,533
EXPOSING THE GAS TANK AND
IT CATCHES THE BRUNT OF
THE EXPLOSION,

252
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,836
AND WHAT YOU GOT
IS A TWO-TONNE,
OUT OF CONTROL,

253
00:13:56,902 --> 00:14:03,909
SURFACE TO AIR AND
BACK TO THE SURFACE,
INCENDIARY DEVICE.

254
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:09,748
WHICH BRINGS ME
TO HOW I MET STAN.

255
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:14,053
HE LIVES AT THE CEDAR LOG HOUSE
AT THE NORTH END OF THE LAKE.

256
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:18,190
WELL, IT'S NOT SO MUCH
CEDAR LOG ANY MORE,

257
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,793
BUT IT'S STILL A PLACE.

258
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,897
IT'S EASY TO FIND BECAUSE
IT'S STILL SMOKING.

259
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:29,568
OKAY, THE SHORT VERSION:

260
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:34,340
WE LET STAN JOIN THE CLUB,

261
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:36,175
WE HELP HIM REBUILD HIS HOUSE,

262
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:40,613
HE DROPS THE CHARGES
AND I GET MY TRUCK BACK.

263
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,114
ALL THOSE IN FAVOUR?

264
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,954
ANYBODY WHO VOTES YES CAN HELP
THEMSELVES TO SOME VERY NICE
CEDAR KINDLING.

265
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,056
[lodge members]
YEAH!!!

266
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,995
[narration by Red]
BILL SAID HE WANTED TO PLAY
SOME STREET HOCKEY,

267
00:14:56,061 --> 00:15:00,366
SO I BROUGHT MY ROLLER BLADES.

268
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:04,336
WELL, NOT WITH SKATES.

269
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:09,608
HE'S TRYING OUT FOR THE FLAMES.

270
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,710
COME ON, OH BOY.

271
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,512
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE, BILL?

272
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,850
I'M FIRING A FEW SHOTS IN AND
BILL'S GOT HIS ROLLER BLADES ON.

273
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,152
OOPS, OH BOY.

274
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,321
I'VE GOT TO HELP HIM, I GUESS.

275
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:23,689
NEED SOME HELP?

276
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,792
OH!!!

277
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:32,698
WELL, HE SEEMS TO HAVE GOTTEN
THE PADS ON AND I'M PROBABLY
NOT IN THE BEST MOOD.

278
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:37,169
BILL, MAYBE JUST LET ME
CHECK THOSE PADS.

279
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,438
HERE, TAKE THE STICK.

280
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,340
HOW ABOUT THIS FRONT UNIT?

281
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,509
HERE'S AN IMPORTANT ONE.

282
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,911
THEY LOOK A LITTLE THIN
AROUND THE BACK, THERE.

283
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,715
BODY CHECK!

284
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,751
BY GOLLY, LOOK AT HIM GO.

285
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,020
HE'S GOOD ON THOSE THINGS.

286
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,889
OH, LOOK AT THAT.

287
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,158
HE'S GOT THE MOVES, AIN'T HE?

288
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,193
LOOK AT THAT GUY GO.

289
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,362
OH, MY.

290
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:07,166
THOSE WHEELS ARE GREAT,
AREN'T THEY?

291
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:10,836
LIKE BEING IN A PINBALL MACHINE.

292
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,371
OH, YOU'RE FINE, BILL.

293
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,807
HAVING THE TIME OF HIS LIFE.

294
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:15,874
OH, OH.

295
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,643
HE'S ON A BREAKAWAY.

296
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,945
I BETTER HOP ON IT.

297
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,747
ALL RIGHT, COME ON, COME ON.

298
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,716
DON'T WORRY, DON'T WORRY.

299
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:25,317
HE'S COMING IN, HE'S COMING IN.

300
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,820
GETTING CLOSE, GETTING CLOSE.

301
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:31,523
HE SHOOTS... HE SCORES!

302
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,326
[applause]

303
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:43,102
THEY DO ANYTHING I WANT.

304
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,939
IT'S GOOD TO BE KING.

305
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,309
WOW! THE GROUNDS ARE SPOTLESS.

306
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,078
WHY, THERE'S NO GARBAGE,
THERE'S NO PILE OF TIRES,

307
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,814
THERE'S NO OLD,
RUSTY WATER HEATERS.

308
00:16:55,881 --> 00:17:00,386
IT'S SO TIDY,
I COULD BARELY FIND
THE FRONT DOOR.

309
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:04,957
SO, WHAT ARE THE GORGONS
GOING TO DO WITH ALL THOSE
OLD CARS, APPLIANCES AND STUFF?

310
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:09,228
I TOLD THEM
THAT THE MOTHERSHIP
CRASHED HERE YEARS AGO

311
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:12,531
AND THAT THOSE
WERE THE PARTS.

312
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,667
ALL THEY'VE GOT TO DO IS
GET THEM BACK TOGETHER

313
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:19,304
AND GET THE WHOLE UNIT
UP ONTO A FLATBED,

314
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,041
TOW IT UP TO PORT ASBESTOS
FOR A SAFETY INSPECTION

315
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:25,377
AND THEY'RE BACK
IN BUSINESS.

316
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,479
SO, YOU'RE LYING TO THEM
JUST TO GET WHAT YOU WANT?

317
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,915
YEP, I'M A BORN
LEADER, HAROLD.

318
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,056
WELCOME TO "THE EXPERTS"
PORTION OF THE SHOW.

319
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,924
THAT PART OF THE SHOW
WHERE WE EXAMINE THOSE
THREE LITTLE WORDS

320
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,026
THAT MEN FIND
SO HARD TO SAY:

321
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,063
[studio audience]:
"I DON'T KNOW."

322
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,165
THAT WAS GREAT!

323
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:50,269
JOINING MY UNCLE RED
IS HIS BEST FRIEND
IN THE WHOLE WIDE ROOM:

324
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,771
WATER TAXI CAPTAIN:
MR. HAP SHAUGHNESSEY.

325
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:58,677
[applause]

326
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,979
OUR LETTER IS FROM MARYLAND.

327
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,381
"DEAR EXPERTS..."

328
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,283
LA, LA, LA.

329
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,452
MY DOCTOR HAS ORDERED ME
TO GET SOME EXERCISE,

330
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,188
BUT I'M NOT
INTO SPORTS.

331
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,156
IS THERE SOMETHING SIMPLE
I CAN START WITH,

332
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,092
TO BUILD UP MY STAMINA
AND MUSCLE STRENGTH,

333
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:16,829
BEFORE I ATTEMPT A MORE RUGGED
SPORT LIKE HACKEY SACK?

334
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,897
WELL, ACTUALLY, THAT'S
A VERY GOOD QUESTION.

335
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:22,201
PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO GO ON
THE SAME FITNESS PROGRAM
AS MY UNCLE RED.

336
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,736
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO BEER.

337
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:28,874
[laughter]

338
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,644
I WOULD SUGGEST THE VIEWER GET
ONE OF THOSE EXERCISE MACHINES.

339
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:35,180
WHAT DO YOU CALL THEM?

340
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,516
THE ONE WITH THE HANDLES
AND YOU SIT ON THEM?

341
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,318
THE NAUTILUS MACHINE.

342
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:40,886
NO, NO, NO.

343
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,588
THE ONE WITH
THE WHEELS AND
THE CHAIN.

344
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:45,424
THE... AH...

345
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,793
THE MOTORCYCLE.

346
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,362
YOU CAN TRY
MOTOR CYCLE JUMPING.

347
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,498
THAT WILL START
YOU OUT EASY ENOUGH.

348
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,466
BY ONLY EXERCISING
YOUR WRISTS

349
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,735
AND YOU LEARN TO DEVELOP
YOUR SENSE OF BALANCE

350
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,670
AND IF ANYTHING
GOES WRONG,

351
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:03,408
IT GIVES YOUR WHOLE BODY
A RELAXING ASPHALT MASSAGE.

352
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,245
SO, YOU WERE A MOTORCYCLE
STUNT JUMPER, MR. SHAUGHNESSEY?

353
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:10,582
YOU NEVER HEARD OF
"ODYSSEY SHAUGHNESSEY?"

354
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,051
I HAD A 1200 HORSEPOWER NORTON.

355
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,820
IT HAD SEVEN GEARS.

356
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:18,223
AND HE'S GIVING US
ALL OF THEM, RIGHT NOW.

357
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,360
[laughter]

358
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,562
YEAH, I WAS THE BEST.

359
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,565
I WAS ALL SET TO JUMP OVER
THE FOUNTAIN AT CAESAR'S PALACE,

360
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,767
THIS WAS LONG BEFORE
EVEL KNIEVEL.

361
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,502
I HAD THE NETWORKS
LINED UP TO COVER IT,

362
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,038
BUT I BACKED OUT
AT THE LAST MINUTE

363
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,274
ON THE INSISTANCE
OF MY GIRLFRIEND.

364
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,143
I'M SURE SHE WAS
JUST AFRAID FOR YOU.

365
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,546
MORE FOR HERSELF, HAROLD.

366
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,081
SHE WAS IN THE SIDECAR.

367
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,517
[laughter]

368
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,522
BYE.
BYE.

369
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,391
WELL, THAT'S THE END OF THAT.

370
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:55,360
THE OLD CULT IS ON THE WAY
TO THE PROMISED LAND.

371
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:58,797
HOW DO YOU FIGURE
PORT ASBESTOS IS
THE PROMISED LAND?

372
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,233
BECAUSE A GUY THERE
PROMISED ME THAT

373
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,001
WHEN THEY SHOW UP
WITH THE SPACESHIP,

374
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:05,404
HE'S GOING TO OUTLAW IT.

375
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,507
YOU KNOW, ITS WEIRD,
BUT I'M GOING TO MISS THEM.

376
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,075
DON'T DO THAT.

377
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,543
CULTS ARE FULL OF FOLLOWERS.

378
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,078
THEY HAVE NO
INDEPENDENT THOUGHT.

379
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,846
THEY GO TO THESE
POINTLESS MEETINGS,

380
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,882
THEY HAVE MEANINGLESS CHANTS.

381
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,717
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

382
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:20,219
YOU KNOW WHAT?

383
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,588
THEY ALL DRESS THE SAME.

384
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:26,358
[loud Laughter]

385
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:31,830
[applause]

386
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,832
HOW DO YOU THINK
THE GORGONITES ARE
GOING TO RESPOND

387
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,501
WHEN THEY FIND OUT
THEIR FLYING SAUCER
DOESN'T EVEN FLY?

388
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:40,772
I GUESS THE FOLKS
AT GORGON ARE GOING TO
HAVE TO SEND DOWN A LOANER.

389
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:43,108
[mysterious noise from outside]

390
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,043
MEETING TIME, UNCLE RED.

391
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,980
WELL, THAT'S NOT
THE POSSUM SQUEAL.

392
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:52,851
[noise increasing]

393
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,354
[engine whining]

394
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,361
DID I JUST SEE
A '53 BUICK

395
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,895
WITH A WASHER AND DRYER
DUCT TAPED TO THE SIDE

396
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:06,298
SHOOT INTO OUTER SPACE?

397
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:12,170
[loud laughter]

398
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,773
NO, NO.
OH, THANK HEAVENS.

399
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,476
THAT WAS A '54 BUICK.

400
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:20,846
[squeal of the Possum]

401
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:23,515
THAT'S THE POSSUM.
YOU GO AHEAD.

402
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,484
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

403
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,255
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

404
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,758
I'LL BE COMING HOME
STRAIGHT AFTER THE MEETING

405
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:36,795
AND THERE'S A CHANCE
I COULD BE ABDUCTED
BY ALIENS LATER TONIGHT.

406
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:41,733
IF YOU HAVE ANY ROMANTIC PLANS,
WE BETTER GET AN EARLY START.

407
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,169
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

408
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:48,240
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND HAROLD
AND THE WHOLE GANG UP HERE
AT POSSUM LODGE.

409
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,610
"KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE."

410
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,785
ALL RISE.

411
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:06,958
[lodge members]:
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI.

412
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,163
OKAY, WE'VE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS,

413
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:13,865
THAT WEIRD CULT IS FINALLY GONE.

414
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:17,402
THEY'RE HEADED BACK TO
THE PLANET GORGON IN
THEIR '54 BUICK.

415
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:21,606
[loud crashing]

416
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,209
A VEHICLE NOT KNOWN FOR
ITS GREAT GAS MILELAGE.

417
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:27,279
