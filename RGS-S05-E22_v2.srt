1
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:06,706
(Chewing)

2
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:08,408
(Burping)

3
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:11,211
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

4
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:13,380
HERE'S THE MAN
WHO'S MADE POSSUM LODGE

5
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:14,881
WHAT IT IS TODAY --

6
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:18,785
BUT, SO FAR,
NO CHARGES HAVE BEEN LAID --

7
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,287
YOUR HOST, MY UNCLE,

8
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:22,956
RED GREEN!

9
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:26,726
(Applause and cheering)

10
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,799
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

11
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,068
REAL EXCITING WEEK
UP AT THE LODGE.

12
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:37,604
OUR FORMER POSTMASTER,
LUCKY BALDERSON,

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,273
HAS TURNED A SET-BACK
INTO A CAREER MOVE.

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,309
HE GOT LAID-OFF
DURING THE LATEST CUT-BACKS.

15
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,645
NOT REALLY -- HE WAS
JUST USELESS, HAROLD.

16
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,480
WOULD HAVE BEEN FIRED

17
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,616
DURING THE GOLD RUSH.

18
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:53,353
I HEARD HE MIGHT OPEN ONE OF
THOSE FAST-FOOD FRANCHISES,

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,088
A REAL POPULAR ONE, TOO.

20
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:58,825
SOMETHING LIKE MOBY DICK'S
DEEP-FRIED WHALE FINGERS.

21
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,894
NO, HE COULDN'T AFFORD THAT.

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,463
BUT HE MIGHT GET
A WILLY'S WEANIES.

23
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,933
OR ONE OF THOSE
JOHN DeLOREAN'S RIBS AND RUMPS.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,003
MAYBEVEVEN MEL TILLIS
HOUSE OF B-B-BEEF.

25
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,738
BUT, WHATEVER HE GETS,

26
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:14,374
I'LL BE DOING ALL THE ADS
FOR HIM.

27
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:17,010
WOW, CELEBRITY ENDORSEMENTS.

28
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:21,514
SO, HAVE YOU GOT ANYONE
TO DIRECT YOUR COMMERCIALS YET?

29
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,483
THERE MIGHT BE A SPOT FOR YOU.

30
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,886
MIND YOU, YOU'D PROBABLY END UP
WORKING FOR WEANIES.

31
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:28,788
(Laughing)

32
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:31,291
WELL, I KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT.

33
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:32,926
(Laughing)

34
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:37,931
(Horns honking)

35
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:42,635
(Geese honking)

36
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:45,205
(Quacking)

37
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,809
(Red): THEY SAY THERE'S NOTHING
ON T.V.

38
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,277
RANGER GORD PROVES IT.

39
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:52,645
MIND YOU, I DON'T CARE.

40
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:55,281
I'M ON CABLE.

41
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:59,285
AND WE GOT HAROLD KIND OF...
WELL, BEING HAROLD.

42
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:02,989
AND HAP SHAUGHNESSY INTRODUCES
A NEW CONCEPT.

43
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:09,429
WELL, LUCKY
WAS UNABLE TO SECURE

44
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,197
A FAST-FOOD FRANCHISE.

45
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,199
THAT'S TOO BAD.

46
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,535
POSSUM LAKE ISN'T
A BIG ENOUGH AREA

47
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,804
TO SUPPORT
A FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT.

48
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:21,574
LUCKY AND I ARE GOING TO START
OUR OWN FRANCHISE, CALLED

49
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,010
"I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S NOT CHICKEN."

50
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,047
WHAT KIND OF MEAT IS IT?

51
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:29,549
NOT CHICKEN.

52
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,050
I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE.

53
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:34,053
LUCKY'S GETTING THE MEAT --
HE KNOWS A GUY.

54
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,157
WHAT DOES IT TASTE LIKE?

55
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,292
WITH FAST FOOD,
TASTE DOESN'T MATTER.

56
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,828
IT'S MARKETING --
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A HOOK.

57
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,563
WE THINK "NOT CHICKEN" IS IT.

58
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,231
WHOA, WHOA, UNCLE RED.

59
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:48,868
I THINK IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE
THE SPOKESPERSON

60
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,603
BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY.

61
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,138
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE.

62
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:53,840
I'LL SAY SOMETHING LIKE

63
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,676
"I DON'T CARE WHERE YOU GO
OR WHO YOU KNOW,

64
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,846
"I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING,
THIS IS NOT CHICKEN."

65
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,048
THEN WE HAVE A LITTLE JINGLE.

66
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,850
HOT LICKING,
IT'S NOT CHICKEN

67
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,351
THE PLOT THICKENS

68
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,686
IT'S NOT CHICKEN

69
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:10,690
AND THEN A LITTLE ANIMAL
FROM MARS WOULD COME OUT.

70
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,359
HAVE YOU INVESTED
A LOT OF MONEY IN THIS?

71
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:14,928
I'M NOT STUPID.

72
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:18,698
ALL I PUT UP WAS MY NAME
AND MY REPUTATION.

73
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,166
(Laughing)

74
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,368
SO THERE'S
NO RISK.

75
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,704
(Laughing)

76
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,206
(Clearing throat)

77
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:28,208
THAT IS NOT CHICKEN.

78
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:30,743
(Laughing)

79
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,880
ANOTHER THING WE'RE DOING --
OW.

80
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:37,884
ANOTHER THING WE'RE DOING
IS SPONSORING A SOCCER TEAM.

81
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:41,588
THAT'S BILL WITH THE
"I CAN'T BELIEVE" UNIFORM.

82
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,623
WE'LL HAVE MORE OF THAT LATER.

83
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,160
WHEN YOU SPONSOR A TEAM
YOU GET THE COMMUNITY PROFILE.

84
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,861
PEOPLE THINK MORE OF YOU.

85
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,997
IT'S KIND OF SOMETHING TO BE...

86
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,498
PROUD OF.

87
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,201
TODAY I'D LIKE TO
SHOW THE LODGE MEMBERS

88
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:58,671
THE RIGHT AND THE WRONG WAY
TO PUT OUT A CAMP-FIRE.

89
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,007
WHAT IS THIS -- KINDLING?

90
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,508
YEAH.

91
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,510
NO, NO, NOT YET, NO.

92
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,512
THIS IS MY TELEVISION SET.

93
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,515
I THOUGHT I WOULD DO
A TELEVISION PRESENTATION.

94
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,017
RED, YOU CAN HELP.

95
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,354
WHERE ARE THE REST
OF THE LODGE MEMBERS?

96
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,358
THEY DECIDED TO WATCH IT
ON T.V. AT THE LODGE.

97
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,859
OH, GREAT.

98
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,361
HI, GUYS.

99
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,862
OK, HERE WE GO.

100
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,364
ARE YOU READY, RED?

101
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,865
YEAH, SURE.

102
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,867
OK.

103
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,369
OK.

104
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,371
OK, TURN ON THE T.V.

105
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,872
OK, RIGHT HERE.

106
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,374
OK?

107
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,875
YEAH -- I GOT IT ON.

108
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,378
(Making buzzing noise)

109
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,879
HI, EVERYBODY.

110
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,381
THIS IS RANGER GORD.

111
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,883
AND HERE'S MY FRIEND,
MR. BAD CAMPER.

112
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,452
(In deep voice):
I'M MR. BAD CAMPER.

113
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,322
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO
PUT OUT A CAMP-FIRE.

114
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,858
(In high voice):
I'M MR. GOOD CAMPER.

115
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:54,327
I DO KNOW HOW TO PUT OUT
A CAMP-FIRE.

116
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:58,498
(In normal voice):
MR. GOOD CAMPER KNOWS HOW

117
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:01,334
TO PUT OUT A CAMP-FIRE --
YOU MUST BE SAD.

118
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,336
(In deep voice): I SURE AM.

119
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:06,739
(In normal voice): WHY DON'T WE
HELP MR. BAD CAMPER

120
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,675
LEARN TO PUT OUT A CAMP-FIRE?

121
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:12,745
(In high voice): FIRST,
LET'S SEE THE RED FLAMES.

122
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,381
(In normal voice): OK,
HERE WE GO.

123
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,383
(Mumbling)

124
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,954
(In high voice): FIRST,
AIM THE WATER

125
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,856
AT THE BASE OF THE FLAMES.

126
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,425
HERE WE GO.

127
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,367
(Coughing)

128
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,869
OK, I GUESS THAT'S IT.

129
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:39,372
(In deep voice): THAT WAS EASY.

130
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,007
NOW I'M MR. GOOD CAMPER.

131
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,209
(In high voice):
HOW ABOUT A HUG?

132
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,711
(In deep voice): OK.

133
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,615
IS THAT IT?

134
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,117
THAT'S IT.

135
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,820
WELL, THAT WAS... INFORMATIVE,
I GUESS YOU'D SAY.

136
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:57,824
LET'S SEE IF YOU'VE GOT
SOMETHING ELSE ON THERE.

137
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,826
"THE WIDE WORLD OF SPORTS"

138
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:04,330
WITH THE THRILL OF VICTORY,
AND THE AGONY OF DEFEAT.

139
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,165
OHHH!

140
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,034
OH!

141
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,304
A WORD TO ALL YOU
YOUNG LADIES

142
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,339
WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE
LOOKING FOR A MATE

143
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,308
FIND YOURSELF
AN UGLY GUY

144
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,110
AND THAT'S THE ONE
YOU SHOULD DATE

145
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:19,078
'CAUSE UGLY GUYS
ARE NICER

146
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,880
UGLY GUYS ARE SMART

147
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:24,517
UGLY GUYS
WILL LOVE YOU FAITHFULLY

148
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,352
UGLY GUYS ARE HONEST

149
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,520
UGLY GUYS ARE TRUE

150
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,021
'CAUSE WHEN
YOU GOT A FACE

151
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,523
LIKE THE BACK END
OF A BOVINE

152
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,425
YOU PRETTY WELL
HAVE TO BE

153
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,195
THIS WEEK ON "HANDYMAN CORNER"

154
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,598
HAROLD HAS JOINED ME,
UNFORTUNATELY.

155
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,701
WE'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE
YOUR OWN NEON SIGN.

156
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,704
A T OF YOUNG PEOPLE
ARE PUTTING NEON LIGHTS

157
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,273
UNDER THEIR VEHICLES
FOR SOME REASON.

158
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,142
UNCLE RED, THAT'S A STATEMENT.

159
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,644
THE STATEMENT IS
"I HAVE TOO MUCH MONEY

160
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,746
"AND NO IDEA
WHAT TO DO WITH IT."

161
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:57,316
WE'LL MAKE OUR "I CAN'T
BELIEVE IT'S NOT CHICKEN" SIGN.

162
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,152
GET SOME NORMAL NEON LIGHTS,

163
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:02,021
THEN BEND THEM INTO
WHATEVER SHAPE YOU WANT.

164
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,523
GO AHEAD, HAROLD.

165
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,024
OH, OK.

166
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,828
WELL, UH... OUR "I CAN'T
BELIEVE IT'S NOT CHICKEN" SIGN

167
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,430
STARTS WITH AN "I".

168
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:11,931
DONE.

169
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,866
OH, OH, IN FACT,

170
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,403
IT HAS 1, 2, 3, 4 "I's"!

171
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,172
LIKE YOU, HAROLD.

172
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,574
OH, LOOK AT THIS --
YES, EXCELLENT.

173
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,843
IT EVEN HAS
AN EXCLAMATION POINT.

174
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,678
BING!

175
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,280
YOUR TURN.

176
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,515
ALL RIGHT.

177
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,984
WELL, WE NEED TWO "C's"
ON THAT.

178
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:35,288
SO, I WOULD SAY WE PUT THAT
INTO THE VICE.

179
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,423
WAIT A SEC, WAIT A SEC,
UNCLE RED.

180
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,459
SAFETY FIRST.

181
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:40,960
FOR GOSH SAKES, HAROLD.

182
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,462
NO, SAFETY.

183
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:43,963
OW, OW, OW, OW!

184
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,798
SORRY,
I'M SORRY.

185
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,300
LET'S TRY
IT AGAIN.

186
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:50,303
THERE.

187
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,038
ALL
RIGHT?
YEAH.

188
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,008
PUT THE TUBE INTO THE VICE.

189
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,311
DON'T TIGHTEN HER UP TOO MUCH.

190
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,813
JUST GET IT A LITTLE SNUG.

191
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,315
SEE WHAT I MEAN?

192
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,217
THAT WAS A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

193
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,719
DON'T EVEN GO WITH
THE VICE ON THAT.

194
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:09,155
JUST TAKE IT AND BEND IT AROUND

195
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,656
SOME KIND OF A PIPE.

196
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:12,425
YOU GONNA HELP ME?

197
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,794
NO -- THANK YOU, THOUGH.

198
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:17,063
ALL RIGHT.

199
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,398
JUST BEND THAT NICE AND
SNUG HER RIGHT UP.

200
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,703
OK --
THAT WAS NOT QUITE PERFECT.

201
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,571
SO, WE'LL ADD SOME HEAT.

202
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,073
HAROLD,

203
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:29,208
FIND MY PROPANE TORCH, WILL YA?

204
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,210
I WAS SOLDERING THE OTHER DAY.

205
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:32,845
I PUT IT DOWN SOMEWHERE.

206
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,347
OH.

207
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,048
OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

208
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,050
RIGHT WHERE I LEFT IT.

209
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:41,687
WE'LL TAKE A BULB, AND GET
THE THING TO SOFTEN UP...

210
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,189
OH!

211
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,857
HAROLD, HELP ME OUT HERE!

212
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,359
HAROLD.

213
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,528
HAROLD, HAROLD, HAROLD.

214
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,229
IT TURNS OUT THAT GLASS

215
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:53,833
WASN'T NEARLY AS PLIABLE
AS HAROLD THOUGHT IT WAS.

216
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,403
TO MAKE LETTERS FOR
OUR SIGN WE'LL NEED SOMETHING

217
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,306
THAT'S LONG AND RUBBERY
AND FULL OF GAS.

218
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,808
SHOOTING FISH IN A BARREL,
UNCLE RED.

219
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,310
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

220
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,812
SO, I'VE GOT
THE LITTLE BALLOONS

221
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,816
THAT MAGICIANS USE
TO MAKE THOSE LITTLE ANIMALS.

222
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,318
(Blowing air)

223
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,820
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S GOING TO BE--

224
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,522
THAT WAS
A BALLOON.

225
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,325
STRETCH THAT OUT
A LITTLE BIT.

226
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,826
I'M SORRY, HAROLD.

227
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,328
NOT
A PROBLEM.

228
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,896
NOT REALLY.

229
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,833
HAROLD, WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE THIS A TRY?

230
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,335
GO AHEAD.

231
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,671
YOU YOUNG PEOPLE,
YOU GOT THE...

232
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,339
AND I DON'T WANT IT,
BUT YOU...

233
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,408
OOO, OH, OH.

234
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,516
WELL, SHE'S ALL WET NOW,
SO...

235
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,851
I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

236
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,353
OH, OH.

237
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,255
WOO.

238
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,924
WELL, WITH THE HELP OF
MY PROPANE TANK,

239
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,659
I'VE FILLED THE BALLOONS

240
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,862
AND FINISHED THE FIRST
TWO WORDS OF OUR SIGN.

241
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,700
NOW ALL I GOT TO DO IS
PLUG HER IN AND GIVE HER A TRY.

242
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,201
WAIT A MINUTE.

243
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,869
HAROLD, COME ON IN HERE.

244
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,371
NO, NO, NO.

245
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,873
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

246
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,444
NOW I CAN PLUG HER IN
AND GIVE HER A TRY.

247
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,449
OH BOY, BEAUTIFUL.

248
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,927
STAY TUNED
WHILE HAP TRIES TO GUESS

249
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,795
WHAT'S MISSING IN HIS LIFE.

250
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,703
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU GUYS
ABOUT LOOKING GOOD.

251
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,040
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE YOU
ANY BEAUTY TIPS OR ANYTHING.

252
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,109
BESIDES,
MOST OF US ARE MARRIED,

253
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,511
AND HOW WE LOOK
COULDN'T MATTER LESS.

254
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,013
(Laughing)

255
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:50,683
BUT, IT IS IMPORTANT
TO LOOK GOOD TO OTHER WOMEN.

256
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,252
FOR A STARR,
WASHING'S A GOOD IDEA.

257
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,855
YOU DON'T WANNA GO
TOO FAR WITH THAT.

258
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,858
EVERY MAMMAL GIVES OFF
CHEMICALS CALLED PHEROMONES.

259
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:01,427
APPARENTLY
THEY DRIVE WOMEN CRAZY.

260
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,763
SO YOU DON'T WANT TO
WASH THEM OFF.

261
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,631
BUT, IF, ON THE OTHER HAND,

262
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,867
STRAY DOGS HOWL
WHEN YOU WALK BY,

263
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:10,703
IT MIGHT BE TIME
TO GET ACQUAINTED

264
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,371
WITH SOME WET SOAP.

265
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,473
YOUR WARDROBE
IS ALSO IMPORTANT.

266
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,210
IF STRANGERS YELL THINGS LIKE,
"HEY, BOZO, JUGGLE THIS!"

267
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,413
CHANCES ARE YOU'RE OVER-DRESSED.

268
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:23,015
EITHER TONE IT DOWN
OR MOVE TO NEW YORK.

269
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,718
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IS YOUR ATTITUDE.

270
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:28,154
IF YOU THINK YOU LOOK GOOD,
IT SHOWS.

271
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,757
AND IF IT SHOWS,
YOU PROBABLY MISSED A BUTTON.

272
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,959
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

273
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,995
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

274
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,064
(Applause and whistling)

275
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:43,002
IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME,
IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ANYBODY.

276
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:46,205
WHY DO WE HAVE TO DO
THE COMMERCIAL OVER AND OVER?

277
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:49,608
DO YOU THINK SPIELBERG QUITS
STRIVING FOR PERFECTION?

278
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,978
STRIVING FOR PERFECTION
WILL DRIVE YOU NUTS.

279
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:57,450
LOWERED EXPECTATION
IS THE KEY TO A HAPPY LIFE.

280
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:00,352
MAYBE NOT PERFECTION,
BUT YOU HAVE TO AT LEAST

281
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,121
PRONOUNCE
WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE PROPERLY.

282
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,191
WHY DON'T I JUST CALL IT
BROWN STUFF?

283
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:07,193
IT'S NOT CHICKEN, I KNOW.

284
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,495
BUT WHAT KIND OF MEAT IS IT?

285
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,996
THAT'S OUR SECRET,

286
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,232
OUR PROFIT MARGIN
AND MARKET POSITION.

287
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:16,535
AND IN A PINCH,
IT'S OUR LEGAL POSITION.

288
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:20,539
FIRST TIME I EVER SEEN
A DRUMSTICK WITH TWO ELBOWS.

289
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,942
HAROLD, PEOPLE ONLY CARE
ABOUT PRICE.

290
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,577
LOOK AT THIS COMBO MEAL.

291
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,480
LARGE POTATO TOTS,
SIDE SALAD, HOT LARDY BUN,

292
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:31,484
BIG SHAKEY, AND 7 PIECES
OF NOT-CHICKEN FOR 89 CENTS.

293
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,985
WOW.

294
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:36,989
IT'S A DOLLAR EXTRA IF
YOU DON'T WANT THE NOT-CHICKEN.

295
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,991
YEAH, BUT IT'S WORTH IT.

296
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,493
OH, YEAH.

297
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,795
(Applause)

298
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,497
WE'RE WITH HAP SHAUGHNESSY

299
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,732
TO PLAY
THE POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME.

300
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,334
WHAT ARE WE PLAYING FOR?

301
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,504
THE GRAND PRIZE IS
A MISMATCHED SET OF ASHTRAYS

302
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,507
FROM THE POSSUM LAKE HOTEL
AND MORTUARY.

303
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,008
ALREADY GOT A SET.

304
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,511
HAROLD, GIVE HIM THE WORD.

305
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:00,513
SHOW THE FOLKS AT HOME.

306
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,515
NOW, RED, YOU READY?

307
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,918
YOU GOT 30 SECONDS
TO GET ME TO SAY THAT WORD.

308
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,853
GO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

309
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,689
UH... QUEEN ELIZABETH
AND I ARE...

310
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,191
OPPOSITES.

311
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,693
NO --
BUT OUR RELATIONSHIP IS...

312
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,962
OH, IMAGINARY.

313
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,532
SHE CALLS ME FOR ADVICE
BECAUSE WE'RE...

314
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:22,034
DELUDED... HALLUCINATIONS...
DREAMING.

315
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:27,473
I- I- I DATED ALL THREE GIRLS
ON THE HIT SERIES CALLED...

316
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,974
"HAMMY HAMSTER"?

317
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,476
"THE SMURFS"

318
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:31,977
I DON'T KNOW.

319
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,479
OK, OK, OK.

320
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,482
ROBERT REDFORD AND I
ARE BEST...

321
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,150
KEPT APART.

322
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,986
FINE, FINE, FINE, RED.

323
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:42,988
I AM ONE OF YOUR CLOSEST...

324
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,490
OH, LIAR.

325
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:45,991
YOUR CLOSEST...

326
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:48,060
UH... LIAR?

327
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:50,996
LIAR?

328
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:54,166
WHAT KIND OF A PERSON
WOULD CALL ME A LIAR?

329
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:58,003
HAP, I'M SORRY, BUT
ALL YOUR FRIENDS DO.

330
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,006
YOU KNOW, IN A FRIENDLY WAY.

331
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:02,508
(Bell ringing)

332
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,009
THAT WAS IT?!

333
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,011
(Laughing)

334
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,513
THAT WAS GREAT.

335
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,715
YOU'RE GOOD AT THIS.

336
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,384
HEY, HANDYMEN,
NOTHING TAKES THE PIZZAZZ

337
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:15,588
OUT OF A PROJECT FASTER
THAN HAVING TO CLEAN UP

338
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:18,023
THE EXTENSION CORD
WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

339
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,825
HERE'S A TIP FOR YOU.

340
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,027
LET THE TOOL DO THE WORK.

341
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,596
(Motor starting)

342
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,973
THE ADS FOR OUR RESTAURANT
HAVE STARTED

343
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,775
AND, BOY,
ARE WE GETTING A RESPONSE.

344
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:39,211
IT'S OK, HAROLD, I'M ALONE.

345
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:45,384
THOSE ADS ARE THE WORST THING
I'VE EVER SEEN ON TELEVISION.

346
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,120
YOU SHOULD WATCH
SOME OF THE STUFF

347
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,989
ON THE WOMEN'S NETWORK.

348
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,892
(Applause)

349
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,194
HEY, HAROLD, THE ADS WORK.

350
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,529
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

351
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,031
I HAVE MY INTEGRITY

352
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:02,301
AS A POWERFUL NEW ARTIST
IN THIS WONDERFUL MEDIUM.

353
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:06,472
WE'RE DOING A LOT OF BUSINESS
AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THOSE ADS.

354
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:07,973
REALLY?

355
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,009
EXCELLENT, COOL.

356
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,510
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

357
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,747
LUCKY'S THINKING ABOUT
OPENING ANOTHER BRANCH,

358
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:18,183
BUT HE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET
ENOUGH NOT-CHICKEN,

359
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,520
SO WE MAY START SERVING
NOT-BEEF AND NOT-SALAD.

360
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,356
WHEN I WAS SHOOTING THESE ADS,
I LOOKED AT

361
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,859
THE DAILIES, THE RUSHES,
AND I THOUGHT

362
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,963
"HEY, HAROLD, HEY, MAYBE
YOU HAVE MANAGED TO CAPTURE

363
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,932
"THE ESSENCE, THE MAGIC."

364
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:34,967
THE CAMERA ANGLES
AND LIGHTING.

365
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,468
I THINK IT'S MORE

366
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:39,471
THE CONCEPT OF A COMPLETE LUNCH
FOR 29 CENTS.

367
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:40,973
WHATEVER -- I DON'T CARE.

368
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,843
AS LONG AS I HAVE A SUCCESSFUL
AD CAMPAIGN ON MY DEMO REEL,

369
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,979
CAN A FEATURE FILM
BE FAR BEHIND?

370
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,481
"NOT-CHICKEN, THE MOVIE."

371
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:50,983
NOT-CHICKEN?

372
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,484
OR NOT-BEEF.

373
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,053
NOT LIKELY.

374
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,491
MEANWHILE BACK AT THE...
THANK YOU, BILL.

375
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,827
MEANWHILE BACK AT
THE SOCCER PITCH,

376
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,829
UH, BILL'S PRACTISING HERE.

377
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,999
WE NEVER PLAYED SOCCER
WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

378
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,068
OF COURSE, WE NEVER DID--

379
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,738
SOMETIMES THAT'S OBVIOUS.

380
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,307
SHOULD HAVE NOTICED
THE VAN, BILL.

381
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,410
DIDN'T REALIZE THAT
IT'S NOT ALL SPONGY.

382
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:22,614
WHEREAS, WITH BILL,
JUST THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE.

383
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:26,785
ALTHOUGH I NEVER PLAYED SOCCER,
IT'S NOT A BAD THING FOR KIDS.

384
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,955
YOU DON'T NEED A LOT OF MONEY
TO GET INVOLVED.

385
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,257
YOU JUST NEED A BALL A SHIRT,

386
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,626
A PAIR OF SHORTS
IN SOME AREAS.

387
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,962
AND YOU DON'T NEED
A LOT OF...

388
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:40,432
YOU DON'T NEED
A LOT OF ATHLETIC ABILITY.

389
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,769
YOU DO NEED SOME
ATHLETIC ABILITY.

390
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:47,339
BUT THE IDEA IS
YOU GET THE RUNNING,

391
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,808
AND YOU GET THE KICKING.

392
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:53,045
YOU DON'T ALWAYS
GET THE KICKING.

393
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,481
LOOK AT THAT.

394
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:56,982
THERE'S A GOAL.

395
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:00,019
AND THAT JUST WITH
A FEW MINUTES PRACTISE.

396
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,921
MIND YOU, HE DID MOVE IN
A LITTLE CLOSER.

397
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,124
I'M GONNA BE STANDING IN GOAL.

398
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,625
HE'LL TRY AND

399
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,995
SCORE AGAINST A REAL GOALIE.

400
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:15,467
THE FANCY FOOTWORK IS --
YOU CAN GET TOO FANCY THOUGH.

401
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,569
ANYWAY, UH, BILL IS PROBABLY --

402
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:20,672
IF BILL CAN DO IT...
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.

403
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:23,008
CAN BILL DO IT,
THAT'S THE QUESTION.

404
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,443
OH BOY.

405
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,212
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

406
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,716
OK, MAYBE I'LL TAKE A TRY
AND GET BILL IN GOAL.

407
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,118
THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH TO IT.

408
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,620
IT'S A BIG...

409
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,455
IT'S A BIG NET TO COVER.

410
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:37,956
OH BOY.

411
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:39,458
HE BLOCKED.

412
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:40,959
NICE SAVE!

413
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,461
EXCELLENT.

414
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:45,431
HE'S GONNA KICK ONE
WAY DOWN THE FIELD.

415
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:47,966
BUT, HE'S THE ONLY ONE
ON THE TEAM,

416
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,334
SO, HE'S GOT TO GO

417
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,969
CATCH HIS OWN PASS.

418
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:52,704
USED TO HAPPEN IN HIGH SCHOOL.

419
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,474
IN EVERY SOCCER GAME
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A...

420
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,975
TIME OUT.

421
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,477
RIGHT, BILL?

422
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,879
OH BOY.

423
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,315
STAY TUNED
WHILE DOUGIE FIGURES OUT

424
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,050
WHAT TO BUY HIS MOTHER.

425
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:14,626
WELL, SO MUCH FOR
THE NOT-CHICKEN RESTAURANT.

426
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,029
OUR MISTAKE WAS RUNNING
THIS CONTEST

427
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,630
AS A PROMOTIONAL THING.

428
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:22,134
IF YOU CAN GUESS
WHAT YOU'RE EATING, IT'S FREE.

429
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,802
A VISITING ZOOLOGIST DID,

430
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,305
AND THE HEALTH INSPECTOR
SHUT US DOWN.

431
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,674
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS?

432
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,443
"DEAR MR. SPIELBERG,
I'M THE DIRECTOR THAT STARTED

433
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,446
"THAT 'NOT-CHICKEN' PHENOMENON,
AND I WOULD APPRECIATE

434
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:38,050
"A SEVEN-PICTURE DEAL
AT YOUR EARLIEST CONVENIENCE."

435
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:42,154
THE NOT-CHICKEN BUSINESS
IS NOW THE NOT-OPEN BUSINESS.

436
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,790
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO NOW?

437
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:48,260
IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS,
LOCATION IS EVERYTHING.

438
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:51,330
SO WE'RE GOING TO MAKE
A FLOATING RESTAURANT.

439
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:54,666
WE CAN GO ANYWHERE,
SUBJECT TO TIDE AND CURRENT.

440
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,736
WE'LL CALL IT "I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S NOT FISH".

441
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,405
THE COPS WILL NEVER
MAKE THE CONNECTION.

442
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,842
CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW THIS
IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT

443
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,777
FROM YOUR EARLIER VENTURES?

444
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:09,381
WE GOT PRIZES: POWER RANGERS,
WRESTLING ACTION FIGURES.

445
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,316
WE'VE GOT POGS OF THE SMURFS.

446
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,652
POGS, YOU GOT POGS?!

447
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,421
THEY'RE FREE WITH
THE NOT-SHRIMP MELT.

448
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,524
OH, I'M ALLERGIC TO SEAFOOD.

449
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,092
NOT THIS SEAFOOD.

450
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:26,131
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT PORTION
OF THE SHOW.

451
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:30,536
THIS WEEK WE HAVE MY UNCLE RED,
AND MR. DOUGIE FRANKLIN!

452
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:34,973
(Cheering and applause)

453
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,676
THIS IS HOW THE LETTER GOES.

454
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:40,412
THE LETTER GOES AS FOLLOWS.

455
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,719
"DEAR EXPERTS,

456
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:51,290
"THIS YEAR I WANT TO MAKE
MY MOTHER'S BRTHDAY SPECIAL.

457
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,059
"I'M HOPING TO BE OUT OF PRISON
BY THEN..."

458
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,862
(Laughing)

459
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,864
"... ONE WAY OR ANOTHER."

460
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,966
"DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS?

461
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,001
"I MEAN FOR A BIRTHDAY GIFT,

462
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:05,504
"NOT HOW TO BUST OUT OF
THIS JOINT."

463
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:09,808
SIGNED "SID IN CELL 'C'
BY THE SEASHORE."

464
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,445
WELL, SID, I THINK YOU SHOULD
STAY IN THE SLAMMER

465
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:14,980
A LITTLE BIT LONGER.

466
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,449
YOU MIGHT WANNA
GO INTO OVERTIME,

467
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:22,187
'CAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE THE REHAB
HAS NOT QUITE KICKED IN AS YET.

468
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:25,023
NOW RED, I THINK THERE'S

469
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,525
A VERY SPECIAL BOND

470
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,927
THAT EXISTS BETWEEN
A MAN AND HIS MOM

471
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,363
THAT TRANSCENDS
ALL RATIONAL THOUGHT,

472
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,932
PARTICULARLY IF HE'S
HER FAVOURITE SON.

473
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:39,037
OF COURSE, MY BROTHER BEN
WOULD KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT.

474
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,273
THEN AGAIN,

475
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,544
YOU KNOW, HE KNOWS EVERYTHING.

476
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,813
HE'S THE APPLE OF MOM'S EYE.

477
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:51,483
BUT TO ME, HE'S JUST PLAIN
ROTTEN TO THE CORE.

478
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,685
THIS FELLOW'S
LOOKING FOR GIFT IDEAS.

479
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,220
ALL RIGHT.

480
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:58,423
WELL... THAT'S
A TOUGH ONE, HAROLD.

481
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,926
I KNOW WHAT MOMS DON'T LIKE.

482
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,894
A SET OF RACING TIRES.

483
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,430
BOY,

484
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:08,133
THAT SURE WAS A WASTE
OF TWO GRAND.

485
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,903
AND A HELL OF A LOT OF
WRAPPING PAPER, AS WELL.

486
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:15,173
WOMEN, GO FIGURE.

487
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,410
THEY ARE SO UNPREDICTABLE.

488
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,445
MY MOM, ON HER BIRTHDAY,

489
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:24,016
I TAKE HER OUT FOR DINNER,
BUY HER FLOWERS.

490
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:26,285
I GET HER THAT ALL THE TIME.

491
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,820
I THINK YOUR MOTHER
WOULD PREFER IT

492
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,757
IF YOU WERE IN PRISON,
LIKE THIS FELLA.

493
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,764
(Applause)

494
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,303
ALL RIGHT.

495
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:48,006
WE'RE OUT IN A RESTAURANT
ON A RAFT IN THE LAKE.

496
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,741
WHAT IS THE LAST THING

497
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,043
YOU'D EXPECT,
HAROLD?

498
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:52,477
A CUSTOMER.

499
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:54,212
(Laughing)

500
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:57,449
A FIRE --
WHOLE THING WENT UP IN FLAMES.

501
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:00,719
I SAID "DON'T RUN THAT
OUTBOARD MOTOR ON PROPANE."

502
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,554
OR WAS IT A GREASE FIRE?

503
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,056
NO, NEITHER ONE.

504
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:07,659
THAT NOT-FISH STUFF KIND OF
SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUSTED.

505
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:10,495
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BURN
TO THE WATER-LINE,

506
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:13,832
BUT THE MORE SHE BURNED,
THE HIGHER SHE FLOATED.

507
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,500
WE LOST THE WHOLE UNIT.

508
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:18,370
AT LEAST YOU CAME OUT
WITHOUT A LOSS OF LIFE.

509
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:19,871
THAT'S A PLEASANT SURPRISE.

510
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:21,273
(Squealing)

511
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,674
MEETING TIME.

512
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,576
GO AHEAD,
HAROLD.

513
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:28,980
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,
I'LL BE HOME AFTER THE MEETING.

514
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,883
I'VE LOST MY APPETITE
FOR FAST FOOD,

515
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,587
OR FAST ANYTHING,
SO THAT SHOULD BE GOOD NEWS.

516
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,190
TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

517
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:41,493
ON BEHALF OF HAROLD, MYSELF,
AND THE GANG,

518
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,695
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

519
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:47,432
(Applause and whistling)

520
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,768
(Possum squeal)

521
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:58,276
(Harold): ALL RISE.

522
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:04,716
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

523
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,651
(Harold): THE FIRE DEPARTMENT

524
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,154
WON'T COME FOR
HEART ATTACKS ANY MORE.

525
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,624
SO IF YOU HAVE A HEART ATTACK,
SET YOURSELF ON FIRE.
