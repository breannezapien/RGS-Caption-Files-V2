00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,273
IT COULD BE A CARDIGAN
WITH A ROCK IN THE POCKET.

160
00:07:21,273 --> 00:07:23,442
TIME TO TAKE HER
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

161
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:29,114
NOW YOU WANNA CHECK THE OPAQUE,
TRANSLUCENT TRANSPARENCY
QUOTIENT OF THE ITEM.

162
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:31,483
SIX SEALED BEAM HEADLIGHTS
AT CLOSE RANGE

163
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:34,319
ROUGHLY APPROXIMATES THE
INTENSITY OF THE SUN.

164
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:38,757
WHAT YOU'RE HOPIN' FOR
IS A DARK SHAPE IN THERE.

165
00:07:38,757 --> 00:07:40,459
IF IT LETS LIGHT THROUGH
IT'S A WEAVE,

166
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:41,727
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS...

167
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,195
CLOTHING.

168
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:45,397
DON'T GO HALFWAY.
USE YOUR HIGH BEAMS.

169
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:50,902
STILL DON'T KNOW?

170
00:07:50,902 --> 00:07:52,637
IT'S TIME TO DO
SOMETHING TO THE GIFT

171
00:07:52,637 --> 00:07:54,873
THAT YOU WOULD
NEVER DO TO YOURSELF...

172
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:57,776
WEIGH IT.

173
00:07:57,776 --> 00:07:59,611
IF IT WEIGHS A LOT
FOR ITS SIZE,

174
00:07:59,611 --> 00:08:01,613
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD SIGN.

175
00:08:01,613 --> 00:08:04,416
NYLON AND DACRON
AREN'T HEAVY.

176
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,117
BUT IF IT'S GOT
SOME HEFT TO IT,

177
00:08:06,117 --> 00:08:08,720
THAT'S GOTTA
BE GOOD NEWS,

178
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,489
WHICH THIS GIFT DOES.

179
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:11,923
THIS IS GETTING EXCITING.

180
00:08:11,923 --> 00:08:15,360
NOW WE TRY THE MAGNET.

181
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,929
THAT'S ANOTHER GOOD SIGN.

182
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:21,800
UNLESS IT'S A PAIR OF PANTS
WITH A REALLY HUGE FLY.

183
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,569
BUT THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT
KIND OF COMPLIMENT.

184
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:27,906
NOW WE HAVE TO TEST THE
RESISTANCE TO COMPRESSION.

185
00:08:27,906 --> 00:08:31,309
SEE, A SPORTS JACKET CAN BE
SQUISHED INTO A BERET.

186
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:34,112
BUT A PORTABLE
MAGELLAN ROADMATE 700...

187
00:08:34,112 --> 00:08:36,414
ROCK SOLID.

188
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:38,183
WHAT YOU'RE LISTENING FOR

189
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:41,052
IS ANY KIND OF FAINT
CRACKING OR SPLINTERING.

190
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:43,154
IF YOU HEAR EITHER
ONE OF THOSE,

191
00:08:43,154 --> 00:08:45,056
YOU CAN BE SURE
YOU'VE JUST MADE THE GIFT

192
00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:47,025
VERY DIFFICULT TO RETURN.

193
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:53,331
MAN, IT WAS A LAPTOP!

194
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:55,066
I DON'T WANT
A LAPTOP.

195
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:57,035
WHO WOULD BUY
ME A LAPTOP?

196
00:08:58,203 --> 00:09:00,238
"TO HAROLD"?

197
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,042
BOY, THAT WAS CLOSE.

198
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:06,645
[ APPLAUSE ]

199
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:15,253
I WANNA TALK TO YOU
OLDER FELLAS FOR A MINUTE

200
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:17,455
ABOUT YOUR CHRISTMAS SPIRIT.

201
00:09:17,455 --> 00:09:19,824
REMEMBER WHEN
YOU HAD SOME?

202
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:21,926
BACK WHEN YOU WERE A KID,

203
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:24,229
CHRISTMAS WAS THE
BEST TIME OF THE YEAR.

204
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:25,730
NO SCHOOL, FREE STUFF

205
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,666
AND A FAT GUY FALLING
DOWN A CHIMNEY.

206
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,769
WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?

207
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:32,237
BUT THEN AS YOU GOT OLDER,

208
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:34,572
THAT EXCITEMENT STARTED
TO FADE, DIDN'T IT?

209
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:36,975
YOU USED TO LOVE WATCHING
"IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE."

210
00:09:36,975 --> 00:09:38,343
THEN YOU
JUST GOT SICK OF IT.

211
00:09:38,343 --> 00:09:39,844
THEN YOU STARTED
WATCHING IT AGAIN,

212
00:09:39,844 --> 00:09:43,715
EXCEPT THIS TIME YOU FOUND
YOURSELF ROOTIN' FOR
OLD MAN POTTER.

213
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:45,784
OF COURSE IT'S NO SURPRISE

214
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:48,686
THAT CHRISTMAS GETS
LESS EXCITING FOR A
MIDDLE AGED GUY.

215
00:09:48,686 --> 00:09:50,355
BY THE END OF THE DAY

216
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:51,923
YOUR WIFE IS CRANKY
FROM OVER WORK;

217
00:09:51,923 --> 00:09:53,491
THE TREE IS DRY
FROM UNDER WATERING;

218
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:55,360
AND THE KIDS
ARE ON A SUGAR BUZZ

219
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,262
THAT WON'T LET UP
'TIL GROUNDHOG DAY.

220
00:09:57,262 --> 00:09:58,830
HERE'S THE THING...

221
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,532
JUST COZ YOU'RE
STRESSED OUT,

222
00:10:00,532 --> 00:10:03,101
THAT'S NO EXCUSE FOR RUINING
EVERYBODY ELSE'S CHRISTMAS.

223
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:05,170
SO I WANT YOU TO
FOCUS ON THE GOOD STUFF...

224
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,804
YOUR FAMILY LOVES YOU;

225
00:10:06,804 --> 00:10:08,706
YOU'VE BEEN BLESSED
WITH SAFETY AND COMFORT;

226
00:10:08,706 --> 00:10:11,409
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
WHEN YOU WAKE UP TOMORROW,

227
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:13,378
YOU'LL BE AS FAR AWAY
FROM NEXT CHRISTMAS

228
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:15,647
AS YOU'RE GONNA
GET ALL YEAR.

229

REMEMBER,
I'M PULLIN' FOR YOU.

WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

IF SOMETHING'S COMING DOWN
YOUR CHIMNEY AND IT
AIN'T SANTA,

OUT THERE.

OH, NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG.

236
00:10:41,706 --> 00:10:45,076
YOU KNOW, AS A STORE OWNER
I'M A BIG FAN OF CHRISTMAS.

237
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:47,745
I JUST HAVE A SLIGHT PROBLEM
WITH ALL THOSE PEOPLE

238
00:10:47,745 --> 00:10:51,816
WHO FEEL THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD
PUT ON A HAPPY FACE.

239
00:10:51,816 --> 00:10:55,586
I DON'T HAVE A HAPPY FACE.

240
00:10:55,586 --> 00:10:57,922
IT'S NOT THAT
I'M NOT HAPPY.

I'M COPING.

00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:05,496
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T
SMILE AT MY WEDDING.

243
00:11:05,496 --> 00:11:08,299
THAT DIDN'T MEAN
I WAS UPSET.

244
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:10,068
I'M SURE AT THE TIME

245
00:11:10,068 --> 00:11:12,737
MARRYING ANNE MARIE
SEEMED LIKE A FINE IDEA.

SO DON'T EXPECT ME
TO GET ALL GIDDY

JUST BECAUSE IT'S -- IT'S
CHRISTMAS, YOU KNOW.

THOSE PEOPLE WITH THEIR BIG,
PHONY HAPPY FACES

ARE JUST
EXTREMELY ANNOYING.

IS POSITION IT A LITTLE BIT
BETTER IN YOUR ROOM

SO YOU MUST LEARN FROM IT.

THAT SECURITY CAMERAS

ARE OFTEN HOOKED UP TO MORE
THAN ONE MACHINE AT

IS ABOUT PEOPLE.

IT'S NOT ABOUT
THE PRESENTS YOU GET
