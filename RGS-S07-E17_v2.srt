IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW!"

BUT CARRIES A BIG CRAMP,

IT'S KIND OF A ROUGH WEEK
ON THE PERSONAL SIDE
THERE THIS WEEK.

10
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,342
BERNICE AND I, WE HAVE SOME
FRIENDS THAT HAVE RETIRED
AND MOVED TO FLORIDA,

11
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:45,412
AND BERNICE IS THINKING
THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD
DO THE SAME THING.

12
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,514
THAT'S A BIT OF
A CHALLENGE, UNCLE RED.

13
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:51,551
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO RETIRE FROM?

00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:55,688
THE THANKLESS JOB OF
NOT HURTING YOU, HAROLD.

15
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:57,424
HOW COME YOU DON'T
WANT TO GO TO FLORIDA?

16
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:02,228
YOU'D BE DOWN THERE AMONGST
THE WARMTH AND ALL THE OTHER 
OLD PEOPLE AND STUFF.

17
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,396
OTHER OLD PEOPLE?

18
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,098
DID I SAY
OLD PEOPLE?
YES.

YOU KNOW WHAT
I MEANT?
WHAT?

20
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:08,001
I MEANT
"OLDER" PEOPLE

21
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,036
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
YOU ARE OLDER THAN SOME THINGS;

YOU KNOW, LIKE,

NO, I DON'T WANT
TO GO DOWN THERE.

24
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,309
I DON'T WANT TO
GO DOWN SOUTH.

25
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:19,045
IT'S LIKE AN ELEPHANT
BURIAL GROUND DOWN THERE.

26
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:23,383
IT'S A GATHERING OF PEOPLE
WITH GREAT BIG EARS
AND WRINKLED SKIN,

AT LEAST WITH ELEPHANTS
THEY DON'T FORGET EVERYTHING.

29
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:33,193
AND THEY DON'T CARRY
GOLF CLUBS IN THEIR TRUNKS.

30
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,227
TRUNKS RIGHT?

BECAUSE THEY HAVE TRUNKS.

33
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,033
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD
HAPPEN IF YOU DID GO?

34
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:44,737
YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT MAKE
ALL SORTS OF NEW FRIENDS.

35
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:47,173
OKAY, WELL AUNT BERNICE
MIGHT MAKE FRIENDS.

NO, NO, I DON'T
WANT TO GO.

AN ARTICLE IN THE PAPER
OF A PLANE CRASH,

00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,013
I CUT IT OUT AND
SHOW IT TO BERNICE,

00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:56,216
SO SHE WON'T WANT TO FLY
ANYWHERE, YOU KNOW.

40
00:01:56,216 --> 00:02:00,453
ALL I'VE GOT TO DO IS CONVINCE
HER THAT POSSUM LAKE IS A GREAT
PLACE TO BE IN THE WINTER.

41
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,489
HOW?

42
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:06,259

WOULD MOVE TO FLORIDA,
THAT WOULD HELP ME.

I GOT IT.

BERNICE IS GOING TO FORGET
ALL ABOUT MOVING SOUTH.

I GOT A WAY TO MAKE HER WANT TO 
STAY AT POSSUM LAKE ALL WINTER.

HAVE SOME SORT OF NATURAL
ATTRACTION FOR A

YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LIVE
IN THE COLDER CLIMATES

122
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,312
THERE ARE SOME VEHICLES
THAT ATTRACT A CERTAIN
AMOUNT OF ATTENTION.

SNOWPLOW AND THE 4x4,

THE SNOWMOBILE, YOU KNOW,
THAT KIND OF THING.

125
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,119
BUT IF YOU WANT TO REALLY
GRAB ATTENTION,

126
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,521
GET YOURSELF A ZAMBONI.

127
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,090
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO
LIVE DOWN SOUTH,

128
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,791
A ZAMBONI IS NOT
A PASTA DISH.

129
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,126
IT'S  A --

130
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,728
WELL, IT'S A BIG THING,
BIG THING LIKE THAT,

131
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,396
AND IT'S --

132
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,064
YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S THE
THING THEY USE TO MAKE
ICE ON THE RINKS.

133
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,966
YOU'LL SEE.

134
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:09,602
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE PRETTY
DEEP POCKETS TO BUY A ZAMBONI.

135
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:12,672
SO TODAY ON HANDYMAN'S CORNER,
WE'RE GOING TO BUILD OUR OWN,

136
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:16,309
USING, ONCE AGAIN, OUR
VEHICLE OF CHOICE, THE K-CAR.

137
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,111
NOW, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO USE A K-CAR.

138
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,313
I SUPPOSE YOU CAN
BUILD AN "OLDSMABONI."

139
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:24,117
BUT WE LIKE THE K-CAR
BECAUSE OF THE COMBINATION
OF AVAILABILITY, COST,

140
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,018
AND THE SENSE OF REVENGE.

141
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,987
LET'S GET STARTED.

142
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,259
ALL RIGHT, NOW, I TOOK THE 
WINDSHIELD OUT OF THIS FOR
A COUPLE OF REASONS.

143
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:36,129
FIRST OF ALL, THE FUN;

144
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:41,401
AND, SECONDLY, I NEEDED TO HOOK 
UP MY ZAMBONI STEERING WHEEL
DOWN TO THE ACTUAL CAR
STEERING WHEEL.

145
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,137
I PUT A PULLEY IN HERE AND A
PIECE OF ROPE, AND HERE'S
HOW THE DEAL WORKS.

146
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:50,543
WHEN I TURN THE ZAMBONI WHEEL
TO THE RIGHT, IT TURNS THE CAR
STEERING WHEEL TO THE LEFT,

147
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:53,146
BUT WE'RE GOING BACKWARDS,
SO WE END UP GOING TO THE RIGHT.

148
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,614
SO IT ALL WORKS OUT.

149
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:57,350
PLUS WE'LL BE DRIVING ON ICE,
SO HOW DANGEROUS CAN THAT BE?

150
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,851
AND HERE'S THE THIRD THING.

151
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,186
BECAUSE OF WHERE I'VE GOT
THE PEDALS MOUNTED ON THERE,

152
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,388
WHEN I STEP ON
THE GAS OR THE BRAKE,

153
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,991
I'VE GOT MY FEET OVER
THE DEFROSTER VENT THERE.

154
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,926
AND I TELL YOU,
IN THE DEAD OF WINTER,

155
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,396
NOTHING BRINGS A SMILE TO YOUR
FACE LIKE A DRAFT WHIPPING
THROUGH YOUR PANTS.

156
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:13,366
NOW, A LOT OF YOU WILL SAY,
"HEY, YOU KNOW, RIGHT THERE,
THAT'S ENOUGH FUN FOR ME."

157
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,401
WE ARE NOT DONE YET.
OH, NO, SIR.

158
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:19,105
BECAUSE THE REAL ZAMBONI IS
A FULLY FUNCTIONAL ICE
MAINTENANCE MACHINE.

159
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,640
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HEADING.

160
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,476
YEAH, THE REAL ZAMBONI, THEY'VE
GOT THE HOT WATER TANKS THERE,

161
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:26,379
AND THE HOT WATER GOES ON
THE ICE AND MELTS IT
AND SMOOTHS IT OVER.

162
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,781
WELL, WE DON'T HAVE
THE HOT WATER TANKS,

163
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:32,852
BUT THE BEAUTY OF A K-CAR,
IT'S NOT ALL THAT HARD TO GET
SOME KIND OF HOT FLUID
LEAKING SOMEWHERE.

164
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:40,760
ALL RIGHT, NOW, I JUST NEED
SOMETHING I CAN DRAG BEHIND
THE UNIT TO SCRAPE THE ICE

165
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,629
AND KIND OF SMOOTH
OUT THE WATER.

166
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,264
OH, THIS WILL WORK.

167
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:51,103
ALL RIGHT, I'VE GOT THE CAR
BUMPER TO KNOCK THE BIG
CHUNKS OFF THE ICE,

168
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:54,173
AND I'VE GOT CAR FLOOR MATS
TO KIND OF SMOOTH THEM OUT.

169
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,542
ONE MORE STEP
THEN WE'RE ALL DONE.

170
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,544
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GOING
TO BE DRIVING THIS UNIT
AROUND THE ARENA,

171
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,079
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
TURNING A FEW HEADS.

172
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,014
WHY NOT PUT IT
TO GOOD USE?

173
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:04,750
EVERY ZAMBONI HAS
ADVERTISING ON THE SIDE.

174
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,719
WHY SHOULD YOURS
BE ANY DIFFERENT?

175
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,323
SURE HOPE HE
APPRECIATES THAT.

176
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,558
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GIVE HER A GO.

177
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,160
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY...

178
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,963
THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING
IS IN THE ZAMBONI.

179
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,765
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

180
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:22,568
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

181
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:26,172
YOU CAN ALMOST HEAR THE
ORGAN MUSIC, CAN'T YOU?

182
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,574
OH, BOY.

183
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,894
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT
PORTION OF THE SHOW,

184
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,629
THE PART OF THE SHOW WHERE WE
EXAMINE THOSE THREE LITTLE WORDS

185
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,664
THAT MEN FIND OH,
SO HARD TO SAY...

186
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:54,500
Audience:
I DON'T KNOW.

187
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,168
HA HA HA.

188
00:08:57,103 --> 00:09:00,273
JOINING ME AND UNCLE RED ON THIS
PORTION OF THE SHOW IS HIS
GOOD FRIEND, RANGER GORD.

189
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:06,679
[applause]

190
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,814
OKAY, THE LETTER
READS AS FOLLOWS...

191
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:11,117
"DEAR EXPERTS,

192
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:13,319
"I HAVE JUST BEEN
BITTEN BY A SNAKE.

193
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,254
"I'M NOT SURE IF
IT IS A POISONOUS ONE,

194
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,590
"AND I'M HOPING THAT
YOU EXPERTS COULD TELL ME.

195
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,693
"THE SNAKE HAS LONG YELLOW 
STRIPES AND IS SHARP
AT ONE END.

196
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,229
"PLEASE HURRY
AS I AM IN --"

197
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:25,665
IS THAT IT?

198
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,401
WELL, THERE'S MORE,
BUT IT GETS ALL SCRIBBLY.

199
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,072
RED AND HAROLD,

200
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,974
THERE'S NO USE
ANSWERING THAT LETTER.

201
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:42,081
THE VENOM FROM THAT PARTICULAR
BREED OF SNAKE CAN DROP EVEN
A FULL-GROWN BIRCH.

202
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,986
THE PERSON THAT WROTE IT

203
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:50,723
PROBABLY USED UP THEIR
LAST OUNCE OF STRENGTH
LICKING THE STAMP.

204
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:53,859
JUST LIKE A BIRCH,
AS IN TREE?

205
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,928
OH, YEAH,
ABSOLUTELY.

206
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,331
YOU KNOW, SNAKES AND TREES 
AREN'T NATURAL ENEMIES.

207
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:02,234
THEY DON'T NORMALLY FIGHT,

208
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:07,173
BUT IF THE TREE WERE
TO ATTACK FIRST,

209
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:12,345
THE SNAKE WILL BITE BACK
AND KILL THE TREE.

210
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:17,016
EVEN IF THE TREE
STANDS PERFECTLY STILL?

211
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,720
ABSOLUTELY.
ABSOLUTELY, RED.

212
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,225
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF STRANGE
THINGS DURING MY 18 YEARS
UP AT FIRE WATCH TOWER 13.

213
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:30,162
BUT WHEN YOU FIRST SEE A
TREE AND A SNAKE BATTLE
TO THE DEATH,

214
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,933
YOU THINK YOU'RE
SEEING THINGS.

215
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,635
YOU KNOW, YOU THINK
IT'S A TRICK OF LIGHT,

216
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:41,173
OR MAYBE ONE OF THOSE STRANGE
MUSHROOMS YOU JUST ATE.

217
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,248
BUT WHEN IT
HAPPENS EVERY DAY,

218
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:52,118
DAY AFTER DAY --

219
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:55,388
OR IF A TREE WERE
TO COME AFTER YOU,

220
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:58,591
YOU BETTER BELIEVE
IT'S REAL, BUDDY.

221
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,293
I JUST WISH I HAD A CAMERA
WHEN IT WAS HAPPENING,

222
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,129
OR EVEN A PENCIL.

223
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,065
OR A GIRLFRIEND.

224
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,533
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
RANGER GORD,

225
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:08,801
BY THE DESCRIPTION
OF THIS SNAKE,

226
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,302
IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE A
TYPICAL GARTER SNAKE.

227
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,737
I DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

228
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:15,608
IT'S PROBABLY
JUST A JOKE, YOU KNOW.

229
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:19,078
AND WHAT ABOUT
THE BIRCH, HAROLD?

230
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,148
WHAT ABOUT THE BIRCH?!

231
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:26,118
YEAH, HAROLD.

232
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:32,191
RED, HAROLD, EVERYONE,
THIS IS AN EXCELLENT LESSON.

233
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,860
THINK OF A SNAKE
AS A ROPE,

234
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,131
A ROPE WITHOUT LEGS AND NOT
AVAILABLE IN HARDWARE STORES.

235
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:42,468
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE DIED
AT THE END OF A ROPE;

236
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:46,138
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE DIED
AT THE END OF A SNAKE.

237
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:49,709
THINK ABOUT IT.

238
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:53,045
I DID.

239
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,648
FOR FIVE MONTHS ONE WINTER.

240
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,483
OH, YEAH.

241
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:02,288
REMEMBER, FOLKS, SNAKES
ARE JUST AS AFRAID OF YOU

242
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:05,157
AS WE ARE OF RANGER GORD.

243
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:09,061
[cheers and applause]

244
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:16,235
OKAY, THE WINTER CARNIVAL
IS COMING ALONG REAL GOOD.

245
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,803
BOY, SHE'S A LITTLE
NIPPY OUT THERE, HAROLD.

246
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,205
YEAH, YEAH.

247
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,840
I WAS LISTENING TO MY
WEATHER RADIO LAST NIGHT.

248
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,775
I WAS GOING TO WATCH
"X-FILES", BUT IT WAS A RERUN.

249
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,944
YOU KNOW, IT'S THAT
SLIME SEWER GUY ONE.

250
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,113
I SAW IT BEFORE,
SO I DIDN'T WATCH IT, RIGHT,

251
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,014
AND I FINISHED ALL MY HOMEWORK 
BECAUSE I SAT OUT OF GYM CLASS.

252
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,950
I EVEN HAD TIME TO FINISH
ALL THE BULLIES' HOMEWORK.

253
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,952
AND I WAS SITTING THERE,
AND I WAS LISTENING TO
THE WEATHER RADIO,

254
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,488
AND THEY SAID THAT THERE'S
A LOW PRESSURE ZONE OVER
UPPER STATE NEW YORK,

255
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:38,057
AND IT'S CAUSING, LIKE, THIS
INVERTED THERMAL AIR FLOW,

256
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,792
AND IT'S DRAWING ALL THE WARM
AIR FROM THE SOUTH

257
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,293
AND IT'S PUSHING OUT
OVER THE ATLANTIC OCEAN,

258
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,796
WHICH IS DRAWING DOWN THE 
FRIGID AIR FROM THE ARCTIC,

259
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,231
AND THAT'S RIGHT
INTO OUR REGION.

260
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,599
THAT'S COMING
IN OUR REGION.

261
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:50,035
THAT'S WHY YOU FEEL
SO NIPPY AS YOU DO RIGHT NOW.

262
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:54,607
YOU KNOW, HAROLD, I KIND OF 
WISH YOU'D GONE TO GYM CLASS.

263
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:59,745
WE'D HAVE BETTER WEATHER,
AND IT WOULD BE YOUR THERMALS
THAT WERE INVERTED.

264
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,714
ANYWAY, WE'RE ALL SET FOR
THE CARNIVAL THERE.

265
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,549
WE'VE GOT THE REFRESHMENT BOOTH,
THE EVENTS ARE ALL SET UP.

266
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:04,817
I THINK IT'S GOING
TO BE A REAL HOOT.

267
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,152
WHAT KIND OF EVENTS
DO YOU HAVE?

268
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,686
BECAUSE EVENTS MAKE OR BREAK
THESE KIND OF THINGS, YOU KNOW?

269
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,655
'CAUSE REMEMBER LAST
SUMMER'S FAIR?

270
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:14,760
STINKY PETERSON SET UP THAT
RUNNING SHOE TRADE-IN BOOTH OUT
THERE IN THE HOT SUMMER SUN.

271
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,997
COMPLETELY DESTROYED
FOOD SALES.

272
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,865
NO, NO, WE'VE
GOT GREAT STUFF.

273
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,066
WE'VE GOT SNOWMOBILE RACES,

274
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:22,168
WE'VE GOT 4x4 RACES,

275
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,502
WE'VE GOT SNOWPLOW RACES,

276
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,204
WE'VE GOT ZAMBONI RACES.

277
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,906
NO, NONE OF THAT STUFF.

278
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,174
AUNT BERNICE
WON'T LIKE THAT.

279
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,775
IT'S TOO LOUD.

280
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:31,844
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE NICE, 
PEACEFUL SPORTING EVENTS;

281
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,979
LIKE, CROSS-COUNTRY SKIING.

282
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,414
OH, YEAH, NO, I FORGOT
TO MENTION THAT.

283
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,383
WHEN WE DO THE
SNOWMOBILE SLALOM,

284
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:41,020
WE'RE GOING TO USE 
CROSS-COUNTRY SKIERS AS PYLONS.

285
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:44,824
YEAH, LIKE THAT.

286
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,692
THAT'S WHAT I MEANT, YEAH.

287
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,160
YOU'VE GOTTA HAVE
STUFF FOR KIDS TOO.

288
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,461
KIDS ARE GOING TO BE THERE.

289
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:50,563
KIDS LIKE STUFF.

290
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,531
THEY LIKE TOBOGGANING
AND HOT CHOCOLATE

291
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,834
AND MAKING SNOWMEN
AND ICE SCULPTURES.

292
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,001
ICE SCULPTURE!

293
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,369
I COULD MAKE
AN ICE SCULPTURE.

294
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:59,038
LET ME MAKE AN ICE SCULPTURE
FOR AUNT BERNICE.

295
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,373
I COULD DO THAT
FOR THE WINTER CARNIVAL.

296
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:03,242
ALL RIGHT, BUT NOTHING WUSSY
OR IN POOR TASTE.

297
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:06,412
I DON'T WANT LIKE A 12-FOOT HIGH
NAKED LADY OR SOMETHING.

298
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:12,318
NO --

299
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,721
GOOD, 'CAUSE YOU'D
PROBABLY MELT IT.

300
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:25,064
Red Green:
SUPPOSED TO DO A LITTLE
TOBOGGANING WITH BILL.

301
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:28,500
WHERE'S YOUR TOBOGGAN, BILL?
WHERE'S YOUR TOBOGGAN?

302
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,169
YOU NEED --
I'VE GOT A BIG TOBOGGAN.

303
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,438
OH, FOR GOSH SAKE.

304
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,073
IT'S A LITTLE --

305
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:36,141
A LUGE.
KIND OF LUGE.

306
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,377
A LITTLE LUGE SLED,
A LITTLE LUGE.

307
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,346
OKAY, BILL,
GET ON IT.
GET ON IT.
GET ON IT.

308
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:43,549
GET ON IT, BILL.
GET ON IT.

309
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,985
ISN'T THERE A JUMP AT THAT END?
A JUMP THERE SOMEWHERE?

310
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:50,623
YEAH, YEAH, THERE'S
A JUMP THERE, YEAH.

311
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,192
ALL RIGHT, LET'S
TRY IT AGAIN.

312
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,060
"RE-LUGE" I GUESS
YOU CALL THIS.

313
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,896
IT'S THE RE-LUGE MAN.

314
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,731
ALL RIGHT, GET ON THERE.

315
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,499
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

316
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:01,934
AND AWAY WE GO.
AWAY WE GO.

317
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,135
THERE YOU GO.
THERE YOU GO.

318
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:04,870
NOW YOU'RE MOVING.
NOW YOU'RE MOVING.

319
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:08,807
OH, THERE'S A TREE.
THERE'S A TREE, BILL.

320
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,743
YEAH, THAT'S THE ONE.

321
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,312
OH, GOING BACKWARDS.
ISN'T THAT JUMP THERE STILL?

322
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:16,782
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

323
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:19,151
LUCKY THE MIRROR
WASN'T THERE, EH, BILL?

324
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:20,986
WATCH FOR THE VAN THERE.
WATCH FOR THE VAN.

325
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:23,923
YEAH, YOU GOT IT.

326
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,591
SO HE'S GOT A
GREAT IDEA HERE.

327
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,026
HE'S GOT HER DOWN
IN THE DITCH.

328
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:30,429
IT'S KIND OF BEVELLED OUT THERE,
SO HE WON'T GET OFF TRACK.

329
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,231
HE'S A LOT SAFER.
A LOT SAFER.

330
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,633
I'LL GET HIM GOING,
SO HE WON'T COME BACK.

331
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,368
LOOKING GOOD.
LOOKING GOOD.

332
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,203
BASKETS!
BASKETS!
BASKETS!

333
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:42,975
UH-OH, DRAINPIPE!
SEWER DRAIN!
SEWER DRAIN!
SEWER DRAIN!

334
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:47,746
OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH!

335
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,785
GOLLY, BILL LOOKS GOOD
WITH A PIPE.

336
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,954
HOW ARE YOU, BILL?

337
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,156
HE'S A LITTLE DRAINED.

338
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,630
IS IT EVER
COLD OUT THERE!

339
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,670
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
IT'S GOING TO RUIN THE
WINTER CARNIVAL.

340
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,605
PEOPLE, WHEN THEY'RE HAVING FUN,
THEY DON'T NOTICE THE COLD.

341
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:18,277
EVEN LIKE AT AN N.F.L.
GAME OUT AT GREEN BAY,
OR WHAT HAVE YOU THERE,

342
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,945
THE PEOPLE ARE --
THEY'RE FREEZING,
BUT THEY'RE FINE.

343
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,347
HALF OF THEM HAVE
THEIR SHIRTS OFF.

344
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,849
MIND YOU, ALCOHOL
DOESN'T FREEZE.

345
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:26,618
I THINK PEOPLE AROUND HERE WILL 
GET THE SPIRIT AND HAVE FUN.

346
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,854
AND I THINK BERNICE IS ACTUALLY
GOING TO THANK ME

347
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:33,225
FOR NOT FIRING HER DOWN TO
FLORIDA BECAUSE SHE'D HAVE
TO MISS ALL THE GOOD TIMES HERE.

348
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,461
OH, THANK GOODNESS!

349
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:38,097
I THOUGHT I WAS
OUTSIDE STILL.

350
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,799
BOY, THAT'S QUITE A SCARF
YOU'VE GOT THERE, HAROLD.

351
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:46,171
I WAS WAITING FOR A GIRL
TO RETURN MY CALL.

352
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:51,810
[laughter and applause]

353
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,747
I'M ACTUALLY SURPRISED
IT'S THAT SHORT.

354
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:58,283
I'VE GOT FOUR OF THEM.

355
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,120
YOU KNOW, I WAS LOOKING
AT YOUR ICE SCULPTURE.

356
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,988
WHAT EXACTLY IS THAT?

357
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,057
WHAT DO YOU
THINK IT IS?

358
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,992
A WASTE OF ICE.

359
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:09,728
I DUNNO, IT COULD BE
A GOOSE, A BEAR.

360
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,731
I'D SAY A MALE BEAR,
JUDGING BY THAT ONE ICICLE.

361
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:15,000
NO, NO, IT'S NOT AN
ANIMAL AT ALL.

362
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,635
IT'S SOMETHING YOU SIT ON.

363
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,204
A HEMORRHOID?

364
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,706
IT'S A THRONE.

365
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,475
IT'S THE ICE THRONE OF THE
POSSUM LAKE WINTER CARNIVAL

366
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:26,979
WHERE THE SNOW QUEEN
WILL SIT AND RULE OVER
HER LOYAL SUBJECTS.

367
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,114
WELL, WHATEVER IT IS, HAROLD,
IT BETTER BE DONE BY TONIGHT

368
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:32,284
BECAUSE THE WINTER CARNIVAL 
STARTS FIRST THING TOMORROW 
MORNING AT 9:00 A.M.

369
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,386
BERNICE IS COMING UP
WITH HER GIRLFRIENDS,

370
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,288
AND I WANT EVERYTHING
TO BE PERFECT.

371
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:38,223
OH, BOY, THAT'S
A TALL ORDER.

372
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,759
WELL, HAROLD, WHEN YOU'VE
BEEN MARRIED AS LONG AS
BERNICE AND I HAVE,

373
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,695
THE CONCEPT OF PERFECT
SLIDES A LITTLE.

374
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:46,398
OH, PERFECT.

375
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,966
RIGHT, YEAH.

376
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,768
[applause]

377
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:52,204
THIS IS THE REPAIR PART
OF THE SHOW WE CALL,

378
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,907
"IF IT AIN'T BROKE,
YOU'RE NOT TRYING."

379
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,209
TODAY WE HAVE GOT JOINING
US Mr. MIKE HAMAR.

380
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,378
WHAT BRINGS YOU TO THE
REPAIR SHOP TODAY, MIKE?

381
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,814
ACTUALLY IT'S A
CONDITION OF MY PAROLE.

382
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,582
THE JAIL WAS FULL.

383
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,918
OH, DID YOU BRING
SOMETHING FOR US TO FIX?

384
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,053
MY STETHOSCOPE, Mr. GREEN.

385
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,888
IT'S BROKEN.

386
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,057
HOW DID YOU
BREAK THIS, MIKE?

387
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:13,826
I DROPPED IT WHEN
I WAS RUNNING AWAY.

388
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:17,796
I MEAN, WHEN I WAS RUNNING 
AROUND THE BLOCK.

389
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:21,867
I LIKE TO CHECK MY HEARTBEAT
WHEN I'M JOGGING AWAY
FROM THINGS.

390
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:25,370
I THINK IT'S THE PART THAT
YOU DON'T PUT IN YOUR EAR
THAT'S BROKEN.

391
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,506
THE FLAT PART
THERE IS CRACKED.

392
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,975
OH, YEAH, THE SURFACE
HAS GOT --

393
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:35,414
YOU GOT ANY LABORATORY-GRADE
MEDICAL LATEX SHEATHING?

394
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:38,217
I'VE GOT A THING
IN MY WALLET.

395
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:45,624
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH
THE DUCT TAPE ON THAT, MIKE.

396
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,794
IF I CAN PULL THAT TIGHT
ENOUGH ON THERE IT WILL
PICK UP THE VIBRATIONS.

397
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,330
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH
A STETHOSCOPE, MIKE?

398
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:57,636
WELL, OH, I THOUGHT I'D LIKE TO
IMPROVE MY LIFE AND GET A JOB.

399
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,471
I THOUGHT MAYBE
I COULD BE A DOCTOR,

400
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,640
LIKE, A NEUROLOGIST
OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW.

401
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,377
SO I THOUGHT I'D GET A
STETHOSCOPE AND SOME
TONGUE DEPRESSORS

402
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:07,146
AND MAYBE SOME
PRESCRIPTIONS,

403
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,815
AND SEE HOW I LIKED IT.

404
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,316
I'VE BEEN DOING
SOME READING,

405
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,353
AND I KNOW ALL ABOUT
THE CIRCULAR SYSTEM.

406
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:21,627
AND HOW THE HEART PUMPS BLOOD
DOWN THROUGH YOUR TINY LITTLE
ARTILLERIES AND --

407
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,562
OH, BONES,

408
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,430
AND OF COURSE, MUSCLES.

409
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,967
DID YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT MORE 
THAN 3,000 BONES IN YOUR HAND?

410
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,703
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

411
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,740
ACTUALLY, I'M MORE
CONCENTRATING ON THE BRAIN.

412
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,477
I'M NOT ALL THAT UP
ON HAND BONES.

413
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:43,148
MIKE, DID YOU KNOW THAT
A STETHOSCOPE CAN BE USED
TO CRACK THE COMBINATION
OF A SAFE?

414
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,685
REALLY?

415
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,520
WELL, BOY, OH, BOY,
Mr. GREEN,

416
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,789
THAT SURE IS
GOOD TO KNOW.

417
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,858
BUT FOR ME, REALLY, I USE --

418
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,961
I LIKE TO USE THE STETHOSCOPE 
TO LISTEN TO THE INSIDE
OF A PERSON.

419
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,597
YEAH, YOU KNOW, HONESTY IS
A BIG PART OF LIFE, MIKE,

420
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:01,166
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE GOING
TO BE A NEUROLOGIST.

421
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:04,903
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

422
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:07,839
YOU KNOW, THAT'S
A GOOD POINT, Mr. GREEN.

423
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,743
ACTUALLY, I MOSTLY USE MY
STETHOSCOPE TO LISTEN
TO MY OWN HEART.

424
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:12,844
DO YOU REALLY?

425
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:16,215
YEAH, SEE?

426
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:19,685
HOW DOES YOUR
HEART SOUND?

427
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,453
IT'S PERFECT.

428
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:24,156
YOUR HEART IS ON
THE OTHER SIDE, MIKE.

429
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,925
OH, YEAH.

430
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,198
[laughter and applause]

431
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:53,885
[cheers and applause]

432
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:58,290
I GOT TO TELL YOU, THAT'S
THE COLDEST EVENT I'VE BEEN AT

433
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,226
SINCE I TOLD BERNICE'S PARENTS
WE WERE GETTING MARRIED.

434
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:03,161
[laughter]

435
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,997
IT'S MINUS 60 DEGREES

436
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:08,133
WITH A WIND CHILL FACTOR
OF MINUS 73.

437
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,568
IS THAT CELSIUS
OR FAHRENHEIT?

438
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,037
WHO CARES?

439
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:15,073
THE WINTER CARNIVAL
WAS A DISASTER.

440
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:16,642
NONE OF THE SNOWMOBILES
WOULD START,

441
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:19,411
AND THE HOT CHOCOLATE
ALL FROZE OVER.

442
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,046
PEOPLE'S BREATH WAS SO THICK,

443
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:24,449
THEY HAD TO STOP TALKING BEFORE 
YOU COULD SEE WHO IT WAS.

444
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,218
DID AUNT BERNICE
ENJOY HERSELF?

445
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:27,853
YEAH, I THINK SHE --

446
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:30,489
I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED
SHE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE CAR.

447
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,824
BUT THEY SEEMED TO BE
HAVING FUN IN THERE.

448
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,559
THEY HAD THE RADIO ON,

449
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,194
AND THEY WERE
PLAYING GIN RUMMY.

450
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:39,064
THEY HAD THE THERMOS
OF GIN AND RUMMY.

451
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,133
[possum call]

452
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,701
MEETING TIME, UNCLE RED.

453
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,569
YEAH, YOU GO
AHEAD, HAROLD.

454
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,405
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

455
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,640
YOU MIGHT THINK
ABOUT GETTING CABLE.

456
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:54,112
SO IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME 
AFTER THE MEETING, BERNICE.

457
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:55,914
AND I WAS HOPING
MAYBE TONIGHT,

458
00:21:55,914 --> 00:22:00,419
WE'LL GET OUT ALL THOSE
BROCHURES OF THOSE RETIREMENT
PLACES DOWN SOUTH,

459
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:04,056
AND WE'LL HAVE THE
BIGGEST FIRE YOU EVER SAW.

460
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:07,592
I'M NOT DEAD HONEY,
I'M JUST COLD.

461
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:09,528
FOR THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

462
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:13,632
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND HAROLD
AND THE WHOLE GANG UP HERE
AT POSSUM LODGE,

463
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:16,034
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

464
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:19,171
[applause]

465
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:25,610


466
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,146
Harold:
EVERYBODY TAKE YOUR SEAT.
HERE HE COMES.

467
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:30,882
YOU CAN SMELL
WHEN HE'S CLOSE.

468
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:33,518
DON'T TELL HIM
I SAID THAT.

469
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:42,494
ALL RISE.

470
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:48,400
Everyone:
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI.

471
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,402
Red:
SIT DOWN.

472
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:52,070
Harold:
JUST GOT ONE QUICK  
ANNOUNCEMENT...

473
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,207
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE THERE
WILL BE NO ICE FISHING
AT POSSUM LAKE.

474
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:59,778
DUE TO THE EXTREME COLD,
THE LAKE IS COMPLETELY FROZEN
SOLID FROM TOP TO BOTTOM.

475
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,980
SO DON'T BE TRYING
TO CARVE A HOLE IN THERE

476
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:07,552
BECAUSE YOU'LL BE WRECKING
ALL THE 4x4s AND SNOWMOBILES AND
APPLIANCES THAT ARE DOWN THERE.
