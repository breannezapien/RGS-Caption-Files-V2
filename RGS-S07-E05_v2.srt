1
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:08,942
IT'S THE "NEW RED GREEN SHOW."

2
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:11,511
(APPLAUSE)

3
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:13,480
AND NOW HERE'S THE
MAN WHO PUSHES
THE ENVELOPE,

4
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:15,582
BUT DOESN'T HAVE
SUFFICIENT POSTAGE
TO SEND IT ANYWHERE,

5
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:16,516
YOUR HOST,
YOUR HERO,
MY UNCLE,

6
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,551
RED GR-E-E-N!

7
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:27,026
(APPLAUSE)

8
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,130
THANKS.

9
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,035
GOT AN EXCITING
GROUP HERE TONIGHT.

10
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:38,738
UNFORTUNATELY, WE'VE GOT
A BIT OF AN EMERGENCY
UP AT THE LODGE
THIS WEEK.

11
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:40,306
ONE OF THE LODGE
MEMBERS IS MISSING.

12
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,542
VANISHED WITHOUT A TRACE,
AND HE'S NOT EVEN MARRIED.

13
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,612
SO THAT CAN ONLY
MEAN ONE THING...

14
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:47,046
ALIEN ABDUCTION?

15
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:48,748
OH, NO, HAROLD.
NO, NO.

16
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:51,684
IF THE ALIENS EVER
COME HERE, YOU'LL BE
THE FIRST ONE THEY'LL GRAB.

17
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:54,287
COOL.

18
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:58,258
I GOT A FEAR OF
FOUL PLAY GOING ON HERE,

19
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:01,828
BECAUSE THIS GUY HASN'T
MOVED MORE THAN 20 FEET
IN THE LAST 18 YEARS.

20
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:02,762
NOT OLD MAN SEDGWICK?

21
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,097
NO, NOT OLD MAN SEDGWICK.

22
00:01:04,163 --> 00:01:05,632
MELVIN DUFFY.
MELVIN DUFFY.

23
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:09,435
HAROLD, HAROLD!
MELVIN DUFFY IS DEAD.

24
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:12,972
WELL, YOU DIDN'T SAY
WHY HE HASN'T MOVED.

25
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,107
IT'S RANGER GORD.

26
00:01:14,173 --> 00:01:16,109
RANGER GORD IS MISSING
FROM HIS TOWER.

27
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:19,612
WE'RE GOING TO GO LOOK
FOR HIM AS SOON AS WE GET
THE 4X4s ALL GASSED UP.

28
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:22,448
EVERYTHING YOU GUYS DO
IS ALL GASSED UP.

29
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:24,550
WE SHOULD BE LOOKING
FOR HIM ON FOOT.

30
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:26,586
WHERE'S THE FUN
IN THAT, HAROLD?

31
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,621
SEARCHING FOR SOMEBODY
ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE FUN.

32
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:34,560
OH, YEAH?
WELL, HOW COME
THEY CALL IT A
SEARCH PARTY?

33
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:53,346
(QUIRKY UPBEAT MUSIC)

34
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,615
THESE ARE ALL SCENES FROM
THIS EPISODE OF OUR SHOW.

35
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,350
WE EVEN HAVE GOT A SPECIAL
SURPRISE FOR YOU.

36
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,285
SO A SECRET KIND OF
THING GOING ON HERE.

37
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:02,221
NO, DON'T SHOW THEM THAT.

38
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,923
THEY BLEW IT.

39
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:07,927
OKAY, HAROLD --

40
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,331
HEY, GUYS -- GUYS.

41
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:19,138
OKAY, HAROLD, I SPOKE TO ALL THE
GUYS, AND THEY'RE WILLING TO LET
YOU JOIN THE SEARCH PARTY.

42
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:22,041
BUT YOU CAN'T KEEP YELLING
"SLOW DOWN,"

43
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:25,611
AND IF YOU FALL OFF THE
ROOF RACK, WE'RE NOT
GOING BACK FOR YOU.

44
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:27,613
OKAY, THAT SOUNDS FAIR.
I'M IN.

45
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,682
I CAN'T BELIEVE
RANGER GORD IS MISSING.

46
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:32,385
I WENT UP THERE TO
FIRE WATCHTOWER 13,

47
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:33,853
AND THE WHOLE DEAL
HAD FALLEN OVER.

48
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,056
LOOKED LIKE BEAVERS HAD KIND OF
GNAWED ON THE FRONT LEGS THERE,

49
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:38,658
AND THE WHOLE THING COLLAPSED.

50
00:02:38,724 --> 00:02:40,059
AND RANGER GORD IS GONE.
EVERYTHING'S GONE.

51
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:43,696
HIS CLOTHES, HIS STAMP
COLLECTION, HIS EIGHT TRACKS,

52
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,632
THE LAVA LAMP, EVEN THE
DISCO BELT, SO THIS IS SERIOUS.

53
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:49,502
UNCLE RED, OH -- OKAY --

54
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:53,105
YOU KNOW, I DON'T -- THIS IS
GOING TO BE EVEN SCARY TO SAY.

55
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:55,041
I MEAN, I HATE TO
EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

56
00:02:55,107 --> 00:02:56,642
WHAT HAPPENS IF --

57
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,377
THE WORST CASE SCENARIO IS...

58
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,345
HE COMES BACK
TO THE LODGE?

59
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:01,180
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT IT.

60
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:06,152
OH, LIFE IS FULL OF MYSTERY

61
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:08,654
THINGS THAT BOTHER
YOU AND ME

62
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:13,159
LIKE, HOW COME
EVERYONE ELSE IS OVERPAID?

63
00:03:13,225 --> 00:03:16,162
BUT THE BIGGEST MYSTERY
TO MICE AND MEN

64
00:03:16,228 --> 00:03:18,898
IT COMES UP IN CONVERSATION
AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN

65
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:22,668
IS HOW IN HOLY BLAZES
ARE SAUSAGES MADE?

66
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:26,505
WELL, THEY TAKE A LITTLE
OF THIS AND A BIT OF THAT

67
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:28,874
GROUND UP HOOVES
AND LOTS OF FAT

68
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:33,846
HIDE AND HAIR AND
BONE AND BARK AND TWIGS

69
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,148
VEINS AND ARTERIES,
GRISTLE AND GRIT

70
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:38,784
AND THEY GRIND IT UP FINE,
SO THAT IT'LL ALL FIT,

71
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:42,655
CRAMMED UP INTO THE
EXIT RAMP OF A PIG

72
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,226
WELCOME TO
"THE POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME."

73
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:50,329
AND THIS WEEK'S GRAND PRIZE IS
FOR 100 ASSORTED TREETOPS

74
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,465
FROM BUD SHERWOOD'S
HELICOPTER RIDES.

75
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:56,602
OKAY, UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE 30
SECONDS TO GET Mr. DOUGIE
FRANKLIN TO SAY THIS WORD.

76
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:01,774
LOVE.

77
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:06,545
GO! -- LOVE -- LOVE...

78
00:04:06,612 --> 00:04:10,483
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. DOUGIE, WHEN
THERE'S SOMEONE WHO YOU CAN'T
LIVE WITHOUT, THAT'S...

79
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:13,919
A KIDNEY DONOR.

80
00:04:13,986 --> 00:04:17,790
NO, THIS IS WHAT A MAN AND WOMAN
FEEL BETWEEN EACH OTHER...

81
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:21,360
GEAR SHIFT?

82
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,263
OKAY. WHEN A COUPLE KISS AND
CUDDLE, THEY'RE IN...

83
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,498
THE BACK SEAT.

84
00:04:25,564 --> 00:04:27,633
NO.

85
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:30,302
PASSION.

86
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:32,705
MONSTER TRUCK.

87
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:35,774
NO, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, THOSE
ROMANTIC SONGS, THEY'RE
ALWAYS ABOUT...

88
00:04:35,841 --> 00:04:38,444
CARS AND SURFIN'.

89
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,679
ALL RIGHT, DOUGIE.
YOUR HEART IS POUNDING.
YEAH.
YEAH.

90
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:42,214
YOU'RE BARELY TOUCHING
THE GROUND.
YEAH.

91
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:43,282
YOU'RE IN...

92
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,985
FOURTH GEAR.

93
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:49,321
JUST A
MINUTE NOW.

94
00:04:49,388 --> 00:04:52,324
OKAY, YOU'RE WITH THE
ONE YOU DREAM ABOUT,

95
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:55,094
YOUR EVERYTHING, OKAY?
YOU'RE IN...

96
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,897
MY GARAGE.

97
00:04:57,963 --> 00:04:59,632
ALMOST OUT OF TIME,
UNCLE RED.

98
00:04:59,698 --> 00:05:02,167
COME ON, DOUGIE, THERE'S MORE
TO LIFE THAN CARS AND
MONSTER TRUCKS.

99
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:04,003
OH, YOU'VE NEVER
BEEN IN LOVE, HAVE YOU?

100
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:05,437
THERE YOU GO!

101
00:05:05,504 --> 00:05:07,339
(BELL RINGING FRANTICALLY)

102
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,509
IT SEEMS THESE DAYS,

103
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:14,780
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE TAKING
LONGER AND LONGER VACATIONS.

104
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:18,317
THAT'S BECAUSE MORE AND MORE
PEOPLE ARE GETTING HOISTED OUT
OF THEIR JOBS THERE, YOU KNOW?

105
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:21,320
SO YOU WANT TO HOLIDAY CHEAPLY,
BUT YOU WANT TO GO IN STYLE.

106
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:27,192
THIS WEEK ON "HANDYMAN CORNER,"
WE'RE GOING TO TURN THE POSSUM
VAN INTO A PALACE ON WHEELS.

107
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:30,863
THAT'S RIGHT, ALL THIS STUFF IS
GOING TO GO INTO THE VAN THERE.

108
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:33,632
WE'RE GOING TO BE
TRAVELLING IN STYLE.

109
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:38,103
ALL RIGHT. WE START BY LAYING A
REMNANT CARPET IN THERE THAT
WE GOT FROM STINKY PETERSON.

110
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,639
ACTUALLY, HE OWED IT TO ME
SINCE HIS DOG WAS SICK.

111
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:43,175
BUT, NOW, CARPETING IS
SOMETHING YOU MIGHT OVERLOOK.

112
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:47,379
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT? THE
CARPETING MAKES IT LOOK LIKE
YOUR VAN WAS CUSTOMIZED BY A
PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMIZER.

113
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:49,481
SO THINK CUSTOMIZERLY.

114
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:51,316
SO ONCE YOU GOT YOUR WHEEL TO
WHEEL CARPETING IN THERE,

115
00:05:51,383 --> 00:05:54,987
YOU WANT TO TOSS IN YOUR VERY
FAVOURITE RECLINER ROCKER.

116
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:58,090
YOU'RE GOING TO GET PRETTY TIRED
AFTER A HARD DAY OF DRIVING,

117
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:01,760
AND YOU NEED SOMETHING
COMFORTABLE TO SIT ON, HUH?

118
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:03,829
YOU'RE ON VACATION,
SPOIL YOURSELF.

119
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,999
IF THIS RECLINER IS ROCKING,
DON'T BOTHER KNOCKING.

120
00:06:07,065 --> 00:06:10,502
OR, MORE THAN LIKELY, IF IT'S
RECLINING, DON'T BOTHER CHIMING.

121
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:13,772
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE GONNA NEED
SOMETHIN' TO KEEP YOUR FOOD
FRESH AND YOUR BEVERAGES COLD.

122
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,809
YOU COULD BUY ONE OF THEM
UNDERSIZED, OVERPRICED
R.V. FRIDGES.

123
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,544
BUT I SAY, WHY BOTHER?

124
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,946
WHEN YOU ALREADY OWN
ONE JUST LIKE THIS?

125
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:26,685
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
ALL RIGHT, NOW, JUST ADD A BED,

126
00:06:26,752 --> 00:06:28,554
MICROWAVE,

127
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,822
ENTERTAINMENT CENTRE THERE,

128
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:32,658
YOUR CLOCK RADIO,

129
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:34,226
A COUPLE OF GAS LAMPS,

130
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:36,695
PICNIC TABLE,
A CHEMICAL TOILET,

131
00:06:36,762 --> 00:06:39,831
YOU'RE IN BUSINESS.

132
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:45,003
ALL RIGHT, I'M THINKING WE NEED
TO MAYBE SCALE DOWN OR SCALE UP,

133
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,072
OR MAYBE EVEN LOSE
SOME WEIGHT HERE.

134
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:50,576
(CRASH)

135
00:06:52,711 --> 00:06:55,047
ALL RIGHT, TIME FOR A RE-THINK.

136
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:58,216
WAIT'LL YOU SEE HOW I GOT
EVERYTHING ARRANGED IN HERE.

137
00:06:58,283 --> 00:07:00,519
YOU WON'T BELIEVE
HOW MUCH OPEN SPACE.

138
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:04,122
I NEVER THOUGHT FOR A SECOND
THAT THE POSSUM VAN COULD TURN
INTO SOMETHING --

139
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:05,891
WATCH YOURSELF ON THE
RUNNING BOARDS HERE.

140
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,260
YOU KNOW, OF COURSE, THE SECRET
WHEN YOU'RE DOING A
PROJECT LIKE THIS

141
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:12,631
IS TO PLACE EVERYTHING SO THAT
IT USES THE SPACE ECONOMICALLY,
ERGONOMICALLY,

142
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,966
AND, WELL, ASTRONOMICALLY.

143
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:16,902
I'VE GOT THE WASHER HERE
AND THE DRYER

144
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:18,937
AND THE WHOLE UNIT SET UP HERE.

145
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:23,141
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE, ISN'T IT,
JUST HOW MUCH SPACE WE'RE
GETTING OUT OF THE VAN?

146
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:26,211
COURSE, ANOTHER SECRET IS THE
ORIENTAL ART OF THE 'FENG SHUI,'

147
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:27,546
WHICH IS AWFUL GOOD
WITH THE BREADED CHICKEN.

148
00:07:27,612 --> 00:07:29,915
AND THAT CREATES SOME SPACE
AND GIVES YOU A FLOW.

149
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:33,085
AND YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT FLOW, HOW ABOUT
HOT AND COLD RUNNING WATER?

150
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:35,954
AND A SPARE TIRE RIGHT THERE
ANY TIME YOU NEED IT.

151
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:37,856
I MEAN, IS THIS COZY OR WHAT?

152
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:40,692
YOU CAN LIVE LIKE A KING AND
TAKE IT ON THE ROAD WITH YOU.

153
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:44,262
IMAGINE JUST SITTING IN HERE,
DRIVING ALL DAY LONG, HUH?

154
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:46,932
NOW THAT'S A HOLIDAY.
THAT'S LIVING.

155
00:07:46,998 --> 00:07:50,535
AND, OF COURSE, WITH THIS
UNIT HERE, YOU'VE GOT ALL
THE CONTROLS RIGHT AT
YOUR FINGERTIPS.

156
00:07:50,602 --> 00:07:51,603
YOU GOT YOUR WIPERS,

157
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,804
YOU GOT DEFROST,

158
00:07:52,871 --> 00:07:54,606
AIR CONDITIONING.

159
00:07:54,673 --> 00:07:57,476
SO THERE YOU HAVE IT,
THE ULTIMATE MOTOR HOME.

160
00:07:57,542 --> 00:08:00,745
WHY DON'T WE TAKE HER FOR
A LAP AROUND THE BLOCK, AND
SEE HOW SHE HANDLES?

161
00:08:00,812 --> 00:08:03,415
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN DON'T
FIND YOU'RE HANDSOME,

162
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:05,283
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

163
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:15,126
(QUIRKY UPBEAT MUSIC)

164
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:22,634
I'M HOPIN' TO TALK TO YOU OLDER
GUYS ABOUT SELF-IMPROVEMENT.

165
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:26,771
YOU KNOW THESE SELF-HELP GURUS
TRYING TO SELL YOU THEIR
PROVEN METHOD

166
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:29,140
OF HOW YOU CAN BE IN
PERFECT SHAPE OR TOTALLY HAPPY

167
00:08:29,207 --> 00:08:32,777
OR, THE BIG ONE,
HAVE MONEY FOR RETIREMENT?

168
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:33,979
HEY, DON'T LISTEN TO THEM.

169
00:08:34,045 --> 00:08:36,081
THEY ALL HAVE THE
SAME BASIC SECRET...

170
00:08:36,147 --> 00:08:36,982
YOU GOTTA WORK HARD.

171
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:38,950
YOU DON'T WANNA HEAR THAT.

172
00:08:39,017 --> 00:08:42,554
IF YOU HAD WORKED HARD IN THE
FIRST PLACE, YOU WOULDN'T BE
BUYING THEIR TAPES NOW,

173
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:46,124
YOU'D BE RICH AND PEOPLE WOULD
BE BUYING YOUR TAPES.

174
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:47,959
YOU DON'T WANT A SENSIBLE PLAN,

175
00:08:48,026 --> 00:08:49,694
YOU WANT A SHORTCUT.

176
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:52,264
YOU DON'T NEED THE SEVEN HABITS
OF EFFECTIVE PEOPLE,

177
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:56,668
YOU NEED THE ONE QUICK CHEAT
OF LAZY GOOF-OFFS.

178
00:08:56,735 --> 00:09:00,038
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
YOU DON'T WANT ADVICE,

179
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:02,674
YOU WANT A MIRACLE.

180
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:07,445
AND I'M GUESSING YOU CAN'T BUY A
MIRACLE FROM A SMILING BALD GUY
ON AN INFOMERCIAL.

181
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:09,247
SO DON'T LET HIM SUCK YOU IN.

182
00:09:09,314 --> 00:09:11,116
WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT
HAVING MONEY FOR RETIREMENT,

183
00:09:11,182 --> 00:09:14,319
HE MEANS HAVING YOUR MONEY
FOR HIS RETIREMENT.

184
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:17,789
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

THIS IS POSSUM BASE.

OVER AND OUT.

191
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,589
THEY'RE FINE. THEY'RE JUST
TALKING ABOUT WHO'S GOING TO
DRIVE THE LEAD VEHICLE
AND STUFF.

192
00:09:51,656 --> 00:09:53,825
YOU KNOW, GUY TALK.

193
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:56,327
ROPE, HAROLD.
NEED ROPE TO GET
HIM OUT OF THE GORGE,

194
00:09:56,394 --> 00:09:57,629
AND DYNAMITE TOO.

195
00:09:57,695 --> 00:09:59,397
WHAT? RANGER GORD
FELL IN A GORGE?

NO, BUSTER HADFIELD
ON HIS A.T.V.

197
00:10:02,934 --> 00:10:05,170
DOING THIS STUPID SHOWING
OFF WITH THE BLINDFOLD.

198
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:08,773
AND THEN STINKY WENT TO GET HIM,
AND THEY'RE BOTH DOWN THERE NOW.

199
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,176
ANY SIGN OF
RANGER GORD?
WHO?

200
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:15,680
OH, NO, NO, NO.
I'LL TELL YOU, IF HE'S
ANYWHERE WITHIN 20 MILES,
HE'S GOING TO SEE THE SMOKE.

201

OH, SEE, THAT'S A GOOD
IDEA,THEY'RE USING
SIGNAL FLARES.

OFF THE TAILGATE.

TANK AT THE BACK.

205
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:32,063
YOU KNOW, HAROLD, YOU MAYBE
WANT TO HELP US SEARCH HERE TOO.

206
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:36,000
NO, NO, NO, I THINK I'LL
JUST STAY HERE AND HELP
DIRECT AMBULANCES.

207
00:10:38,136 --> 00:10:39,604
WELL, HERE ON
"TRICKS OF THE TRADE,"

208
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:42,173
WE USUALLY HAVE A GUY WHO'S
"BEEN THERE, DONE THAT."

209
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,377
THIS TIME, WE'VE GOT SOMEONE
WHO'S BEEN CAUGHT, DONE TIME.

210
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:48,079
HERE'S MIKE HAMAR.
TAKE IT AWAY, MIKE.

211
00:10:48,146 --> 00:10:52,483
(APPLAUSE)

212
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,085
THANKS, Mr. GREEN.

213
00:10:54,152 --> 00:10:56,254
YOU KNOW, WHEN PEOPLE
FIND OUT I'M AN EX-CON,

214
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:59,557
THEY ALWAYS ASK ME HOW
TO AVOID GETTIN' MUGGED.

215
00:10:59,624 --> 00:11:02,493
HEY, I COULD USE THE CASH.
WHY SHOULD I TELL YOU?

216
00:11:04,562 --> 00:11:07,565
OH, GEE, I LOVE THAT
TYPE OF HUMOUR.

217
00:11:07,632 --> 00:11:13,705
OKAY, IF YOU WANT TO AVOID
GETTIN' MUGGED, THE THING TO
DO IS STAY AWAY FROM MUGGERS.

218
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:14,872
NO, SERIOUSLY.

219
00:11:14,939 --> 00:11:17,408
LOOK, IF YOU'RE FAR AWAY
FROM A MUGGER,

220
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:19,544
HE CAN'T MUG YOU, RIGHT?

221
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,513
NOW, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
THE LONG ARM OF THE LAW,

222
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,783
BUT A CRIMINAL'S ARM IS
ONLY ABOUT YAY LONG.

223
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,819
CAN'T REACH YOU, SEE?

224
00:11:27,885 --> 00:11:31,355
NOW, IF YOU'RE REALLY STUPID
ENOUGH TO HANG OUT WITH
A BUNCH OF MUGGERS,

225
00:11:31,422 --> 00:11:34,192
YOU SHOULD LEARN THIS
SELF-DEFENCE MOVE.

226
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:39,897
HERE, TAKE IT.

227
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:44,368
THAT'S IT.

228
00:11:44,435 --> 00:11:45,837
YOU JUST REMEMBER --

229
00:11:45,903 --> 00:11:49,106
JUST REMEMBER THOSE THREE LITTLE
WORDS:  "HERE, TAKE IT,"

230
00:11:49,173 --> 00:11:50,775
AND YOU HAND OVER YOUR WALLET,

231
00:11:50,842 --> 00:11:54,745
AND YOU'LL BE BROKE,
BUT HEALTHY.

232
00:11:54,812 --> 00:11:56,881
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T
WORRY ABOUT IT AT ALL

233
00:11:56,948 --> 00:12:01,052
BECAUSE THE ODDS AGAINST GETTING
MUGGED IN A BIG CITY ARE
ABOUT 1 IN 1,000.

234
00:12:01,118 --> 00:12:03,754
SO THAT'S, LIKE,
365 DAYS IN A YEAR,

235
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:06,224
INTO 1,000 AND YOU CARRY --

236
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,193
WELL, IT WORKS OUT TO
ABOUT THREE YEARS, RIGHT?

237
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:13,331
SO, ONE DAY OUT OF
EVERY THREE YEARS,

238
00:12:13,397 --> 00:12:16,167
STAY HOME.
YOU'LL BE FINE.

239
00:12:18,703 --> 00:12:20,738
I GOT DOWN TO THE POND A LITTLE
BIT AHEAD OF BILL THERE,

240
00:12:20,805 --> 00:12:22,373
AND I WAS SKIPPING STONES.

241
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,208
BROUGHT BACK --
LEAVE ME ALONE, BILL --

242
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:26,344
AND BROUGHT BACK A LOT
OF MEMORIES WHEN I WAS
A KID AND EVERYTHING.

243
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,013
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ADVENTURE
WAS, BUT I WAS JUST KIND OF --

244
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,981
WHAT ARE WE?

245
00:12:31,782 --> 00:12:36,787
OH, SO THOSE WEREN'T JUST
ORDINARY -- I'VE GOT ONE LEFT.

246
00:12:36,854 --> 00:12:39,190
ONE:  THAT'S STILL
A COLLECTION.

247
00:12:39,256 --> 00:12:41,292
EVEN ONE, YEAH,
ONE IS A COLLECTION.

248
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:42,560
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

249
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:45,896
OH, OH, ALL RIGHT.
NOW, COME ON.

250
00:12:45,963 --> 00:12:48,833
THERE'S LOTS OF STONES, BILL.
THERE'S STONES ALL OVER
THE PLACE.

251
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,568
STONES IN THE HILLS
AND IN THE VALLEY.

252
00:12:50,634 --> 00:12:53,070
YEAH, THERE YOU GO.

253
00:12:53,137 --> 00:12:54,972
IT'S EASY TO PERK
HIM UP, YOU KNOW?

254
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,474
SO BILL GOES OUT LOOKING
FOR MORE ROCKS;

255
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,109
GOTTA START AGAIN
WITH THE ROCK COLLECTION.

256
00:12:58,175 --> 00:12:59,710
IF AT FIRST YOU
DON'T SUCCEED --

257
00:12:59,777 --> 00:13:01,112
WATCH YOUR HEAD...

258
00:13:01,178 --> 00:13:03,047
OW-OH.
AND YOUR FOOT.

259
00:13:03,114 --> 00:13:04,648
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

260
00:13:04,715 --> 00:13:06,050
NO, WE'RE FINE.

261
00:13:06,117 --> 00:13:07,385
WE'RE GOOD.
WE'RE GOOD.
WE'RE GOOD.

262
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:08,986
ALL RIGHT, BILL
SEES A STONE THERE.

263
00:13:09,053 --> 00:13:09,954
HE SEES A ROCK?

264
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,289
OW. OH-OH-OH.

265
00:13:12,356 --> 00:13:13,991
ALL RIGHT, BILL SEES A ROCK.

266
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:16,727
HE'S -- GOT THE MAG --
LOOK AT THE MAGNIFYING GLASS.

267
00:13:16,794 --> 00:13:21,565
MAGNIFIES SO HE CAN SEE VARIOUS
GRAINS AND MAYBE SOME OF
THE MINERALS AND --

268
00:13:21,632 --> 00:13:24,468
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT
THE BRE-X PEOPLE SHOULD'A HAD.

269
00:13:24,535 --> 00:13:26,570
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT YOU
YOUNGER KIDS MIGHT WANNA WATCH.

270
00:13:26,637 --> 00:13:30,174
SEE, THE SUN IS ACTUALLY GOING
THROUGH THE GLASS --
WELL YOU CAN --

271
00:13:30,241 --> 00:13:33,310
(SNIFFING)

272
00:13:33,377 --> 00:13:34,478
I DUNNO.

273
00:13:34,545 --> 00:13:36,046
IT'S NOT THE ROCK.
WHAT IS IT?

274
00:13:36,113 --> 00:13:37,481
OH, THERE IT IS.
THERE IT IS.

275
00:13:37,548 --> 00:13:39,683
IT'S YOUR FOOT, BILL.
IT'S YOUR FOOT.

276
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,619
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
OH, IN THE POND.

277
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:44,221
IN YOU GO.
IN YOU GO.
IN YOU GO.

278
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:48,225
THERE.
FEELS GOOD.

279
00:13:48,292 --> 00:13:51,162
I THINK THAT'S HOW
TEA WAS INVENTED.

280
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:52,830
ANYWAY, WE'LL GET
THAT SHOE OFF.

281
00:13:52,897 --> 00:13:54,298
EMPTY IT OUT, BILL.

282
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:59,370
QUITE A BIT OF WATER.
BOY, THAT HOLDS A LOT.

283
00:13:59,436 --> 00:14:02,306
MUST BE ONE OF
THOSE WATER JORDANS.

284
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:06,443
ANYWAY, WE GET BACK TO LOOKING
FOR THE ROCKS THERE AND --

285
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:10,648
LOOK OUT, BILL,
THERE'S A ROCK.

286
00:14:10,714 --> 00:14:12,082
NOT A ROCK -- IT'S A RAKE.

287
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:13,250
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A ROCK.

288
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:15,452
IT CERTAINLY FELT LIKE A ROCK.

289
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,954
WELL, BILL'S GOT ONE THERE.

290
00:14:17,021 --> 00:14:18,355
AND GOT THE --
I'M FINE.

291
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:19,823
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME, BILL.
I'M OKAY BACK HERE.

292
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:20,958
NO, NO, I'M FINE, REALLY.

293
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:22,893
NO, NO, DON'T BOTHER YOURSELF.

294
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,064
LATER THAT SUMMER, BILL HAD
ACTUALLY UNCOVERED THE ROCK.

295
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:31,268
MAN, I WAS JUST SITTING
DOWN FOR A COUPLE
OF WEEKS THERE.

296
00:14:31,335 --> 00:14:34,605
AND, ANYWAYS,
HOW ARE YOU GOING --

297
00:14:34,672 --> 00:14:38,409
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE?

298
00:14:38,475 --> 00:14:40,911
OH, ALL RIGHT. THIS IS GOOD.
A LITTLE BIT OF PHYSICS HERE.

299
00:14:40,978 --> 00:14:43,247
WE GOT THE LAW OF THE LEVER.

300
00:14:43,314 --> 00:14:46,050
AND HE'S GOING TO STICK
THAT IN AND HOPEFULLY
JUST LEAVE 'ER.

301
00:14:46,116 --> 00:14:49,153
NO, HE'S NOT -- OH, BOY.

302
00:14:49,219 --> 00:14:53,257
THESE ARE GROWN MEN
THAT ARE TRYING THIS.
BEAR THAT IN MIND.

303
00:14:53,323 --> 00:14:55,526
ANYWAY, WE'RE TRYING TO GET
THAT THING GOING --

304
00:14:55,592 --> 00:14:57,628
AND THEN, POOF!
UP SHE GOES.

305
00:14:57,695 --> 00:14:59,496
THERE YOU GO, BILL.
THERE'S YOUR ROCK.

306
00:14:59,563 --> 00:15:01,532
GO GET IT.
GO GET IT.

307
00:15:01,598 --> 00:15:03,867
IT'S YOURS, BILL.
IT'S ALL YOURS.

308
00:15:03,934 --> 00:15:05,569
OH, OH, OH.

309
00:15:05,636 --> 00:15:07,871
AND THERE'S BILL'S
ROCK COLLECTION.

310
00:15:07,938 --> 00:15:09,973
WELL, THAT'S NOT PERFECT, NO.

311
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,243
NO, SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT.

312
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,479
THERE WE GO.
PERFECT.

313
00:15:19,082 --> 00:15:26,824
(QUIRKY UPBEAT MUSIC)

314
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,393
I'LL TELL YOU, THE SEARCH PARTY
FOR RANGER GORD

315
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:34,097
TURNED INTO THE RESCUE PARTY
FOR THE OTHER HALF OF
THE SEARCH PARTY.

316
00:15:34,164 --> 00:15:39,469
WE SAVED ALL THE LIVES,
OVER HALF OF THE TRUCKS,
AND MOST OF THE HOT DOGS.

317
00:15:39,536 --> 00:15:41,238
NO SIGN OF
RANGER GORD, THOUGH.

318
00:15:41,305 --> 00:15:42,673
NO, NO.

319
00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:50,247
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

320
00:15:50,314 --> 00:15:51,915
WOW.

321
00:15:51,982 --> 00:15:53,550
LOOK AT ALL
THOSE PEOPLE.

322
00:15:53,617 --> 00:15:55,652
RANGER GORD, WE WERE
LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR YOU.

323
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:57,921
NO, NO,
ALL RIGHT.
IT'S OKAY.

324
00:15:57,988 --> 00:16:01,992
DID YOU GO INSANE FROM
LONELINESS AND RUN OFF?
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YOU ALL RIGHT?

325
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:04,461
WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE
YOU WERE OR NOTHING.
WE WERE LOOKING FOR YOU.

326
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,331
I'M FINE.

327
00:16:07,397 --> 00:16:08,765
OKAY. GOOD.

328
00:16:08,832 --> 00:16:10,300
NO, I CALLED OUT
TO YOU GUYS IN THE WOODS,

329
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:13,036
BUT YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME,
I GUESS, OVER ALL THE
ENGINE NOISE.

330
00:16:13,103 --> 00:16:15,472
NO, NO, WE WERE
LOOKING FOR YOU.

331
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:17,207
YOU KNOW, TOWER WAS
TIPPED RIGHT OVER THERE.

332
00:16:17,274 --> 00:16:19,109
WE ASSUMED
THE WORST.

333
00:16:19,176 --> 00:16:21,912
OH, YEAH. WELL, I FINALLY
RAN OUT OF CREAMED CORN,

334
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:25,215
SO I WAS FORCED TO EAT
THE FRONT TWO LEGS OF MY TOWER.

335
00:16:25,282 --> 00:16:28,418
I COULDN'T EAT THE BACK LEGS
BECAUSE THEY'RE MAPLE AND,
AS YOU KNOW, RED,

336
00:16:28,485 --> 00:16:30,821
I'M HARDWOOD INTOLERANT.

337
00:16:30,887 --> 00:16:33,323
SO YOU JUST WALKED AWAY,
JUST LIKE THAT?

338
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,791
WELL, NOT EXACTLY.

339
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:37,227
I MEAN, IT'S BEEN 17 YEARS
SINCE I LAST GOT A PAYCHEQUE,

340
00:16:37,294 --> 00:16:39,196
SO I DECIDED
TO TAKE A STAND.

341
00:16:39,262 --> 00:16:40,697
ALL RIGHT.
YEAH.

342
00:16:40,764 --> 00:16:43,266
THEY LAID ME OFF.

343
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,235
GOVERNMENT
CUTBACKS.

344
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:48,572
OH, YEAH, NO, NO,
THERE'S A LOT OF THAT
THESE DAYS, YEAH.

345
00:16:48,638 --> 00:16:52,075
NO, THIS WAS 17 YEARS AGO
WHEN THEY LAID ME OFF.

346
00:16:52,142 --> 00:16:55,545
THE POST OFFICE LOST A LETTER
CONTAINING MY PINK SLIP.

347
00:16:55,612 --> 00:16:57,547
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

348
00:16:57,614 --> 00:17:00,617
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF THE FORESTRY
DEPARTMENT WAS RUN AS BADLY
AS THE POST OFFICE?

349
00:17:00,684 --> 00:17:03,887
BOY, THE LETTERS
WE WOULDN'T GET.

350
00:17:03,954 --> 00:17:06,490
ANYWAYS, I'M BACK
IN CIVILIZATION.

351
00:17:06,556 --> 00:17:09,426
OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT.
YOU'RE AT POSSUM LODGE.

352
00:17:11,762 --> 00:17:17,234
I'VE NOTICED THAT YOU TEENAGE
BOYS ARE KIND OF INTO THE
FAST FOOD, FAST CARS AND
FAST COMPUTERS;

353
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,937
WHEREAS THE GIRLS
ARE JUST INTO FASTING.

354
00:17:21,004 --> 00:17:22,772
SPEED IS A BIG ISSUE
WITH YOU YOUNG FOLKS.

355
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:26,510
IT SEEMS THE FASTER THINGS GO,
THE HAPPIER YOU ARE.

356
00:17:26,576 --> 00:17:29,846
I GUESS YOU NEVER HEARD THE
STORY ABOUT THE TORTOISE
AND THE HARE, EH?

357
00:17:29,913 --> 00:17:33,250
BECAUSE, TO ME, YOU YOUNG GUYS
ARE KIND OF LIKE THE HARE,

358
00:17:33,316 --> 00:17:35,552
AND US OLDER FELLOWS ARE MORE
LIKE THE TORTOISE...

359
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:37,787
WE DON'T HAVE THE HAIR ANYMORE.

360
00:17:37,854 --> 00:17:40,724
I'LL TELL YOU, IF LIFE HAS
TAUGHT ME ONE THING,

361
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,459
AND IT'S PROBABLY ALL IT HAS,

362
00:17:42,526 --> 00:17:46,162
IS THAT THE FASTER YOU GO,
THE MORE YOU MISS.

363
00:17:46,229 --> 00:17:47,831
AS YOU GET OLDER,
YOU'RE GOING TO REALIZE

364
00:17:47,898 --> 00:17:50,300
THAT WE'RE ALL, PRETTY MUCH,
HEADING FOR A BRICK WALL.

365
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:54,371
THE QUESTION IS:  HOW HARD DO
YOU WANT TO HIT IT?

366
00:17:54,437 --> 00:17:57,774
REMEMBER, ANYTHING WORTH DOIN'
IS WORTH DOIN' SLOW.

367
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:01,111
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT
PORTION OF THE SHOW.

368
00:18:01,177 --> 00:18:04,948
THAT PART OF THE SHOW WHERE WE
EXAMINE THOSE THREE LITTLE WORDS
THAT MEN FIND SO HARD TO SAY...

369
00:18:05,015 --> 00:18:07,384
Audience:  I DON'T KNOW.

370
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,985
THAT'S SO COOL.

371
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:11,721
ALL RIGHT, JOINING UNCLE RED
ON THE EXPERT PORTION
OF THE SHOW THIS WEEK

372
00:18:11,788 --> 00:18:14,024
IS HIS GOOD FRIEND AND THE OWNER
OF HUMPHREY'S EVERYTHING STORE,

373
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,392
Mr. DALTON HUMPHREY.

374
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:18,061
(APPLAUSE)

375
00:18:18,128 --> 00:18:19,462
WELCOME.
WELCOME.

376
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:21,131
OKAY.

377
00:18:21,197 --> 00:18:22,732
THIS WEEK'S LETTER
GOES AS FOLLOWS...

378
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,101
"DEAR EXPERTS...

379
00:18:25,168 --> 00:18:27,404
"MY WIFE AND I HAVE
BEEN MARRIED FOR 32 YEARS."

380
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,340
WELL, THERE'S VERY LITTLE
WE CAN DO FOR YOU NOW.

381
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:32,308
THAT'S NOT IT.
THERE'S MORE.

382
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,911
JUST LET ME
FINISH HERE.

383
00:18:34,978 --> 00:18:38,581
"RECENTLY, THE LAST OF OUR
SEVEN CHILDREN GRADUATED
FROM HIGH SCHOOL

384
00:18:38,648 --> 00:18:42,052
"AND MOVED OFF TO GO TO
MCDONALD'S UNIVERSITY.

385
00:18:42,118 --> 00:18:45,655
"EVER SINCE OUR LAST CHILD LEFT,
MY WIFE HAS BEEN IN A
TERRIBLE BLUE FUNK.

386
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:47,891
"WHAT'S HER PROBLEM?"

387
00:18:48,158 --> 00:18:50,960
NO IDEA.

388
00:18:51,027 --> 00:18:54,164
NOW, DID I HEAR RIGHT?
THEY HAD SEVEN KIDS,
THE KIDS HAVE GONE.

389
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,801
AND NOW THAT THE KIDS
ARE GONE, SHE'S UPSET?

390
00:18:57,867 --> 00:19:00,136
DID THE KIDS
COME BACK HOME?

391
00:19:00,203 --> 00:19:03,473
NO, NO, THEY GREW UP AND THEN
THEY WENT OFF TO UNIVERSITY,

392
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,309
SO SHE'S HOME ALONE
WITH HER HUSBAND, SO...

393
00:19:11,981 --> 00:19:14,050
SHE RAISED THE CHILDREN, YOU
KNOW, ALL THOSE YEARS

394
00:19:14,117 --> 00:19:17,187
AND, YOU KNOW, NOURISHED
THEM AND FED THEM, WATCHED
THEM GROW, SUPPORTED THEM,

395
00:19:17,253 --> 00:19:20,323
AND THEY MOVED OUT ON TO
UNIVERSITY AND --

396
00:19:24,994 --> 00:19:28,731
SHE'S ALONE WITH A MAN NOW --
HER HUSBAND -- AND THEY'RE
ALONE IN THE HOUSE...

397
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:32,101
AND, YOU KNOW, AND HE
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HER
MOODS OR NEEDS AND WANTS.

398
00:19:33,403 --> 00:19:37,207
IT'S AN EMPTY NEST SYNDROME,
IS WHAT IT IS, YOU KNOW!

399
00:19:37,273 --> 00:19:38,641
EMPTY NEST SYNDROME,
YOU KNOW?

400
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,743
THIS POOR WOMAN
IS GOING THROUGH
A BIG CHANGE IN
HER LIFE.

401
00:19:42,478 --> 00:19:43,179
OH, THE CHANGE.

402
00:19:45,548 --> 00:19:47,417
OH, YES, I KNOW
WHAT THE CHANGE IS.

403
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:49,118
I JUST NEVER
HEARD IT CALLED
"EMPTY NEST."

404
00:19:49,185 --> 00:19:50,520
THAT'S A BIT GRAPHIC.

405
00:19:50,587 --> 00:19:59,662
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

406
00:19:59,729 --> 00:20:03,333
YOU KNOW, YOU TURN
THE THERMOSTAT DOWN,
IT'LL BE FINE.

407
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:06,903
NO, HER CHILDREN ARE GONE.
HER CHILDREN HAVE MOVED ON.

408
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,204
HER LIFE...

409
00:20:08,271 --> 00:20:10,840
YOU DON'T GET IT, DO YOU?
NO, YOU DON'T.

410
00:20:10,907 --> 00:20:14,010
OH, YOU GUYS SHOULD BE SO
ASHAMED. YOU DON'T EVEN GET IT.

411
00:20:14,077 --> 00:20:15,111
WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?

412
00:20:15,178 --> 00:20:17,413
PUBERTY.

413
00:20:21,384 --> 00:20:23,486
RANGER GORD IS COMING.
DON'T UPSET HIM, ALL RIGHT?

414
00:20:23,553 --> 00:20:25,021
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?  WHAT?

415
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:26,589
APPARENTLY, HE SPENT
18 YEARS IN THE WOODS;

416
00:20:26,656 --> 00:20:28,491
HE'S GOT NOTHING
TO SHOW FOR IT, OKAY?

417
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:30,560
EVENTUALLY HE'S
GOING TO REALIZE
HE WASTED HIS LIFE.

418
00:20:30,626 --> 00:20:32,695
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

419
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:37,934
HI, GUYS.

420
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,035
OH, LOOK,
IT'S GORD!

421
00:20:39,102 --> 00:20:40,169
OH, HEY, GORD.

422
00:20:40,236 --> 00:20:42,238
HI, HOW ARE
YOU DOING?

423
00:20:42,305 --> 00:20:44,407
JUST WANDERING AROUND
THE LODGE, SEEING HOW
THINGS HAVE CHANGED,
I GUESS.

424
00:20:44,474 --> 00:20:46,476
A LOT OF THINGS HAVE
CHANGED IN 18 YEARS.

425
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:47,577
NOTHING.
SORRY.
HAROLD.
HAROLD.

426
00:20:47,643 --> 00:20:48,745
WHAT?
WHAT?
WHAT?

427
00:20:48,811 --> 00:20:52,048
(WHISTLING)

428
00:20:52,115 --> 00:20:53,916
NO, THE LODGE IS
PRETTY MUCH THE SAME.

429
00:20:53,983 --> 00:20:55,084
FURNITURE IS THE SAME.

430
00:20:55,151 --> 00:20:57,954
THE SAME GARBAGE
IN THE CORNER.

431
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,624
SAME TUB OF COTTAGE CHEESE
IN THE FRIDGE.

432
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:03,593
WE GOTTA
THROW THAT OUT.
I'LL MAKE A NOTE.

433
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:05,094
STINKY'S STILL
ON WORKMEAN'S COMP.

434
00:21:05,161 --> 00:21:06,963
BUSTER'S STILL
DATING THAT WAITRESS.

435
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:09,432
MOOSE'S NICKNAME
STILL FITS HIM.

436
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:15,771
NOBODY'S GONE BACK TO WORK OR
STARTED A NEW JOB OR
GONE BACK TO SCHOOL.

437
00:21:15,838 --> 00:21:17,306
NOTHING.

438
00:21:17,373 --> 00:21:20,877
18 YEARS AND NOTHING
TO SHOW FOR IT.

439
00:21:20,943 --> 00:21:24,514
OH, NOW, GORD, NOW
DON'T BE HARD ON YOURSELF.

440
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,618
ME? NO, I'M GOING TO CASH IN ON
EVERYTHING I'VE LEARNED IN THE
LAST 18 YEARS IN THE WILDERNESS.

441
00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:31,354
YEAH, I'M GOING TO CREATE
A CHARACTER THAT'LL TEACH
KIDS ABOUT THE WILDERNESS.

442
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,290
