1
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:11,444
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW!"

2
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,046
AND NOW HERE'S THE MAN
WHO LAUGHS AT LIFE,

3
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,314
BUT THE FEELING'S
MUTUAL...

4
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:15,882
YOUR HERO,
YOUR HOST,
MY UNCLE,

5
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,650
RED GR-E-E-E-N!

6
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:27,961
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

7
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:30,296
ALL RIGHT. BIG, BIG WEEK UP
AT THE LODGE THIS WEEK.

8
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:34,701
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE OUR SECOND
ANNUAL SWAMP SKIING COMPETITION.

9
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:37,103
YEAH, THE WAY THAT WORKS IS WE
GET A GUY WATER SKIING,

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,772
WE GO DOWN TO THE BOGGY
END OF THE LAKE THERE,

11
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:44,644
AND WE CRANK THE BOAT AROUND,
AND THE GUY FIRES INTO
THE SWAMP AREA THERE,

12
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,981
AND WE JUST SEE IF HE CAN
COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE.

13
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:49,449
I DON'T KNOW, UNCLE RED.

14
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,384
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S GOING TO
BE ANY SWAMP SKIING THIS YEAR.

15
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:52,752
OH, REALLY?

16
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:55,088
OH, YES, REALLY, 'CAUSE YOU
NEVER GO, DO YOU?

17
00:00:55,154 --> 00:00:56,556
OH, NO, NOT YOU.

18
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:59,225
YOU JUST SIT IN THE BACK OF
THE BOAT AND LAUGH AT EVERYBODY.

19
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:02,362
COME ON, HAROLD,
I'VE JUST GOT A GOOD SENSE
OF HUMOUR, THAT'S ALL.

20
00:01:02,428 --> 00:01:05,532
OH, NO, NO, NO, ALL THE GUYS SAY
THEY'RE NOT GOING UNLESS YOU GO

21
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:08,801
'CAUSE LAST YEAR EVERYBODY
GOT ALL DRAGGED THROUGH
THE SMELLY BOG.

22
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:12,538
THEY GOT ALL WHIPPED IN THE
FACE WITH THESE STICKS AND
BUSHES AND TWIGS AND STUFF,

23
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:14,440
AND THEY GOT SLAPPED
OUT THE OTHER END,

24
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:17,610
AND THEY HAD A FACE FULL OF
MUD AND A MOUTHFUL OF ALGAE.

25
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:23,182
TOOK TWO WEEKS FOR THE FAT GUYS
TO PRY THE BULRUSHES OUT OF
THEIR BELLY BUTTONS.

26
00:01:24,817 --> 00:01:26,552
I DON'T CARE WHAT
THE WHINERS SAY, HAROLD.

27
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,955
THE SWAMP SKIING
COMPETITION IS A GO.
WE'VE DECIDED.

28
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,524
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
'WE'VE' DECIDED?
'YOU' DECIDED.

29
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,060
WELL, THE LODGE -- ME/WE,
IT'S ALL THE SAME.

30
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:36,362
NO, SEE, THAT'S JUST IT.
NO, IT'S NOT ALL THE SAME.

31
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,264
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

32
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:41,000
SEE, YOU'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL
NOT TO FORCE PEOPLE INTO THINGS
THAT YOU WANT TO DO.

33
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,536
SOMETIMES YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE
IN TO A HIGHER AUTHORITY.

34
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,004
NOT AT THE LODGE, HAROLD.

35
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:47,140
I ONLY DO THAT AT HOME.

36
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:49,942
(APPLAUSE)

37
00:01:50,009 --> 00:02:04,457
[♪♪♪]

38
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:06,392
TODAY'S SHOW IS
ALL ABOUT ESCAPING.

39
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:10,096
WE'VE GOT HAP HERE WHO
ESCAPES INTO HIS IMAGINATION;

40
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:13,800
WE'VE GOT BILL WHO ESCAPES
INTO A TREE...

41
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:16,436
SOMETIMES;

42
00:02:16,502 --> 00:02:18,371
AND I'M ESCAPING INTO
A LITTLE FREEZER DEN.

43
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:24,110
MORE ABOUT THAT LATER ON.

44
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:27,413
WELL, THE SWAMP
SKIING PREPARATION HAS
OFFICIALLY STARTED.

45
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,550
JUST GET THE LODGE MEMBERS
TO SIGN UP, AND THEN WE'LL
SET THE DATE ONCE WE KNOW

46
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:33,619
WHEN THERE'S GOING TO BE
A DOCTOR VACATIONING
IN THE AREA.

47
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:37,323
COME ON, HAROLD, WE'VE GOT
A SHOW TO DO HERE.

48
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,258
OH, YEAH, YEAH, SORRY,
UNCLE RED, SORRY.

49
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,094
I WAS JUST OUTSIDE TALKING
TO JUNIOR SINGLETON.

50
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:44,197
YOU KNOW, HE'S PRETTY
UPSET WITH YOU, YOU KNOW,

51
00:02:44,263 --> 00:02:46,465
BECAUSE OF THE WAY, YOU KNOW,
HAVE TO RUN THINGS AROUND HERE.

52
00:02:46,532 --> 00:02:47,667
HE'S VERY UPSET
ABOUT THAT.

53
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:49,669
HE WANTS TO GET
TOGETHER AND TALK.

54
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:51,504
BRING HIM IN RIGHT NOW.
WE'LL TALK HERE.

55
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,739
OH, NO, NO, I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T CLARIFY THAT.

56
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:56,242
WHEN HE WANTS TO GET TOGETHER
AND TALK, YOU KNOW,

57
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,978
WHEN YOU SPEAK --
WHEN THEY TALK LIKE THAT --

58
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,113
WHEN HE SAID 'WE'
GET TOGETHER,

59
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,282
HE MEANT WE;
NOT WE.

60
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,118
LIKE ME AND HE;
NOT YOU.

61
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:08,487
OH, SO YOU'RE GOING TO
BE MEETING WITH JUNIOR.

62
00:03:08,554 --> 00:03:11,157
YES, YES, JUST JUNIOR AND ME --
JUST JUNIOR AND ME...

63
00:03:11,223 --> 00:03:14,527
AND ABOUT FIVE OTHER OF THE
LODGE MEMBERS, MAYBE 10.

64
00:03:15,561 --> 00:03:16,929
WHAT'S THIS
ABOUT, HAROLD?

65
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:18,898
WELL, YOU ALWAYS GET A SAY
IN WHAT GOES ON AROUND HERE.

66
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,666
YOU KNOW, SOME OTHER PEOPLE
HAVE GOT SOME IDEAS TOO,

67
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,401
AND SOME PRETTY DARN
GOOD ONES SOMETIMES.

68
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,036
BUT YOU ALWAYS
SAY NO, RIGHT?
NO.

69
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:27,039
SEE, SEE, SEE!
JUST LIKE THAT.

70
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,508
WHAT ABOUT THAT TIME WE WANTED
TO GET LODGE JACKETS,
AND YOU SAID NO?

71
00:03:29,575 --> 00:03:32,578
WHAT ABOUT THAT TIME ALL THE
GUYS WANTED TO GO TO PORT
ASBESTOS AND SEE THE NEW
ASPHALT SPREADER,

72
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:34,146
AND YOU SAID NO.

73
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,015
WHAT ABOUT THE TIME WE WANTED
TO GET SNACKS WITH BETTER
EXPIRY DATES?

74
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,250
YOU SAID NO.

75
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:40,419
WELL, JUNIOR GOT THINKING.
HE'S TIRED OF HEARING
YOU SAY NO,

76
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,655
AND MAYBE HE HAS
AN IDEA THAT --

77
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,324
JUNIOR HAD THIS REALLY --
THIS IS MORE JUNIOR
SPEAKING THAN ME.
YEAH.

78
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,626
JUST I'M CHANNELING
AT THIS MINUTE.

79
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:49,895
HE'S THINKING OF STARTING
UP A RIVAL LODGE,

80
00:03:49,962 --> 00:03:53,599
AND A LOT OF THE POSSUM
LODGE MEMBERS ARE GOING
TO GO WITH HIM.

81
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,468
WELL, GOOD FOR JUNIOR.

82
00:03:55,534 --> 00:03:57,236
REALLY?
YEAH.

83
00:03:59,004 --> 00:03:59,739
CAN WE HAVE OUR
FIRST MEETING HERE?

84
00:03:59,805 --> 00:04:02,208
NO.

IT'S THE POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

98
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,582
THIS WEEK Mr. MIKE HAMAR IS
PLAYING FOR THE GRAND PRIZE

99
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:47,419
OF HAVING HIS CHARGES COMMUTED
TO 30 DAYS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE.

100
00:04:47,486 --> 00:04:49,555
YEAH, YEAH.
GOOD LUCK, MIKE.

101
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:52,858
ALL RIGHTY, MIKE, YOU HAVE 30
SECONDS TO GUESS THIS WORD

102
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,593
AND --
YOU'RE PEEKING.

103
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,962
DON'T BE PEEKING.

104
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,668
KNOW WHAT, THE WORD IS CHEATER.

105
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,570
CHEATER.

106
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,205
GO.
30 SECONDS, GO.

107
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,806
ALL RIGHT, MIKE, THERE IS
SOMETHING --

108
00:05:07,873 --> 00:05:09,375
CHEATER?

109
00:05:09,441 --> 00:05:14,613
(LAUGHTER)

110
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,515
OKAY, MIKE, YOU PUT A LOT OF
TIME AND WORK INTO THIS,

111
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,283
BUT IT PAYS OFF MONEY
IN THE LONG RUN.

112
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,852
A BANK ROBBERY?

113
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:22,221
NO, NO, NO,
YOU ALREADY HAVE MONEY.

114
00:05:22,287 --> 00:05:23,389
NO, I DON'T.

115
00:05:23,455 --> 00:05:25,290
WELL, JUST IMAGINE
THAT YOU DO, OKAY?

116
00:05:25,357 --> 00:05:26,558
SO YOU NEED TO MAKE A...

117
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,193
QUICK GET AWAY.

118
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,896
NO, MIKE, THIS ISN'T
MONEY FROM A ROBBERY.

119
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,231
YOU EARNED IT.

120
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:35,234
OH, LIKE A REWARD WHEN YOU
SQUEAL ON A GUY, RIGHT?

121
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,169
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

122
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,238
SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU HAVE THAT MONEY
WHEN YOU GET OLDER,

123
00:05:39,304 --> 00:05:40,672
SO YOU NEED TO FIND A GOOD...

124
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:42,775
HANDGUN.

125
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:44,910
(LAUGHTER)

126
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,679
MIKE, YOU'RE ON PAROLE, OKAY?
YOU CAN'T USE A HANDGUN.

127
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:49,381
NO, NO, NO, I WOULDN'T
USE IT, Mr. GREEN.

128
00:05:49,448 --> 00:05:51,016
IT'S SORT OF AN INVESTMENT.

129
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,451
OH, BOY!

130
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,653
(FRANTIC BELL RINGING)

131
00:05:57,756 --> 00:06:01,827
YOU KNOW, EVERY MAN NEEDS
A PLACE HE CAN GO TO IN
HIS OWN HOME,

132
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:05,764
KIND OF A REFUGE WHERE HE
CAN BE ALONE TO DO WHAT
HE ENJOYS THE MOST,

133
00:06:05,831 --> 00:06:07,299
AND WHAT HE DOES THE BEST...

134
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,901
NOTHING.

135
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:13,772
NO TALKING, NO SHARING,
NO MOVING, NO THINKING.

136
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,176
NOW, SOME GUYS, THEY HAVE A DEN
OR MAYBE A BASEMENT WORKSHOP.

137
00:06:17,242 --> 00:06:20,145
SOME HAVE A GARAGE OR
EVEN A BARN THEY CAN GO TO.

138
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:22,080
BUT THIS WEEK ON
HANDYMAN CORNER,

139
00:06:22,147 --> 00:06:26,818
I'VE GOT A PROJECT FOR THE
MAN WHO HAS ABSOLUTELY
NO SPACE AT ALL.

140
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,722
EVER NOTICE HOW LAZY PEOPLE
LIVE IN SMALL HOUSES?

141
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:33,725
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU DON'T NEED
MUCH SPACE WHEN YOU'RE
NOT DOING ANYTHING.

142
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:35,894
YOU DON'T NEED A WHOLE
ROOM TO GO TO.

143
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:38,697
ALL YOU NEED IS
AN OLD FREEZER, HUH?

144
00:06:38,764 --> 00:06:42,467
WOULDN'T THAT BE A GREAT
SPOT TO GO TO TO COOL OFF?

145
00:06:42,534 --> 00:06:44,002
YOU GET ENOUGH
ACCESSORIES IN THERE,

146
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:47,639
AND YOU CAN TURN THIS UNIT
INTO THE DEN OF YOUR DREAMS.

147
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:50,075
YOU KNOW, CARPENTERS HAVE A
VERY IMPORTANT SAYING...

148
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:53,245
MEASURE TWICE, CUT ONCE.

149
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:54,813
THAT'S A GOOD THEORY, ISN'T IT?

150
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,315
YOU'VE NEVER ACTUALLY
DONE IT, HAVE YOU?

151
00:06:56,381 --> 00:06:58,283
WELL, THIS IS NO TIME TO START

152
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,452
BECAUSE THIS IS AN
AIR-TIGHT FREEZER HERE.

153
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,155
IF ALL OF YOUR CUTS
ARE ACCURATE, AND YOUR
MEASUREMENT IS CORRECT,

154
00:07:03,221 --> 00:07:04,489
IT COULD KILL YOU.

155
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:06,458
SO THROW THAT CUT AWAY.

156
00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:09,661
ALL RIGHT. WHAT YOU WANT TO
DO IS YOU WANT TO CUT A
HOLE YAY BY YAY,

157
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:12,264
MAYBE A LITTLE MORE YAY
THIS WAY THAN THAT.

158
00:07:13,932 --> 00:07:16,535
ALL RIGHT. THE FIRST THING YOU
WANT TO DO IS DRILL A HOLE IN
THE SIDE OF THE FREEZER,

159
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:19,771
SO YOU CAN CUT OUT WHERE
THE T.V. IS GOING TO GO.

160
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:25,077
NO, NO, NO, THAT'S
THE SECOND THING.

161
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:27,679
FIRST THING YOU WANT TO DO
IS UNPLUG THE FREEZER.

162
00:07:29,881 --> 00:07:31,616
THERE WE GO.
THAT'S A PERFECT FIT.

163
00:07:31,683 --> 00:07:35,253
REMEMBER: NO GAP, NO AIR.

164
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,892
YOU WANT TO HOLD IT SECURELY
IN PLACE THERE, USING THE
HANDYMAN'S SECRET WEAPON,
DUCT TAPE.

165
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,697
BECAUSE IF YOU DROP YOUR T.V.
INTO YOUR FREEZER, IT'S NOT
COVERED BY EITHER WARRANTY.

166
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:50,535
ALL RIGHT. ONCE YOU'VE GOT YOUR
T.V. MOUNTED ON THERE,

167
00:07:50,602 --> 00:07:53,538
YOU'VE GOT TO START THINKING
ABOUT BEVERAGES AND SNACKS.

168
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:58,977
SO GET YOURSELF ONE OF THESE
UNITS HERE, SOMETHING
ALONG THIS LINE.

169
00:07:59,044 --> 00:08:02,447
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS
MOUNT THAT ON THE SIDE
OF YOUR FREEZER,

170
00:08:02,514 --> 00:08:05,116
SO THEY'LL FEED DOWN
INTO THE DEN AREA.

171
00:08:06,952 --> 00:08:08,620
ALL RIGHT, ONCE THOSE
ARE MOUNTED ON THERE,

172
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:11,356
YOU PUT YOUR FAVOURITE BEVERAGE
IN THE COOLER, AND IT GOES
DOWN THE TUBE.

173
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:14,960
YOU PUT YOUR FAVORITE SNACK
INTO THE DUCT, AND IT
GOES DOWN THE CHUTE.

174
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:17,963
NOW, WE'VE GOT THIS OLD DUSTPAN
HERE TO CONTROL THE SNACKS,

175
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:22,734
AND WE'VE GOT THE CLOTHESPEG
ON THERE TO GET THE DRINKS
COMING AND GOING.

176
00:08:22,934 --> 00:08:24,636
NOW, FOR THAT EXTRA
TOUCH OF LUXURY,

177
00:08:24,703 --> 00:08:27,539
I'M GOING TO LINE THE DEN
WITH THE FOAM HERE,

178
00:08:27,606 --> 00:08:30,609
AND THEN COVER ALL THAT
WITH THE SHAG CARPETING.

179
00:08:30,675 --> 00:08:32,277
SO IT WILL KIND OF
BE LIKE A VAN,

180
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:33,778
BUT NO WOMEN.

181
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:36,248
SO IT'LL BE LIKE MY VAN.

182
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:39,417
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S GOT IT.

183
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:41,820
NOW, I'VE GOT TO JUST MAKE
A LITTLE ADJUSTMENT TO
THE DOOR SWITCH HERE.

184
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:46,691
THAT WAY WHEN I RETIRE TO MY
DEN AND I CLOSE THE DOOR,

185
00:08:46,758 --> 00:08:48,627
THE LIGHT WILL STAY ON.

186
00:08:48,693 --> 00:08:50,962
ALL RIGHT. HERE'S ANOTHER
LITTLE RIG THAT I'VE
ADDED TO HER.

187
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:53,398
I'VE PUT THESE LEGS
ON THE BACK HERE,

188
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:55,667
AND THIS ALLOWS THE
WHOLE UNIT TO RECLINE.

189
00:08:55,734 --> 00:08:58,403
SHOW YOU HOW THAT
WORKS IN A MINUTE.

190
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,938
OH, MY GOSH, WRESTLING IS ON.

191
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:04,576
OKAY. SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

192
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:07,212
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

193
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:10,382
NOW RECLINE.

194
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:14,953
WOW, IT'S LIKE I'M RIGHT
IN THE WRESTLING RING.

195
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:21,626
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU OLDER
GUYS ABOUT SOMETHING YOU HAVEN'T
DONE IN A WHILE...

196
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:23,795
CHANGE.

197
00:09:23,862 --> 00:09:26,364
PEOPLE SAY YOU'RE OUT OF IT
BECAUSE FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS,

198
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:30,335
YOU'VE BEEN DRESSING THE SAME
WAY, TALKING THE SAME WAY AND
THINKING THE SAME WAY.

199
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:32,637
I SAY, GOOD FOR YOU.

200
00:09:32,704 --> 00:09:33,872
YOU STICK WITH IT.

201
00:09:33,938 --> 00:09:36,174
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO STAND
UP FOR TRADITION.

202
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:38,510
AND HOLD FIRM BECAUSE
TOO MUCH IS CHANGING.

203
00:09:38,576 --> 00:09:41,212
THE PHONE RINGS WEIRD NOW.

204
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,681
RUNNING SHOES LOOK
LIKE SPACESHIPS,

205
00:09:43,748 --> 00:09:45,016
EVEN THE CONTINENTS
ARE SHIFTING...

206
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,318
BUT NOT YOU.

207
00:09:47,385 --> 00:09:49,320
YOU STICK TO YOUR GUNS.

208
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:54,359
YOU KEEP WEARING THOSE
SHORT-SLEEVED POLYESTER
DRESS SHIRTS.

209
00:09:54,425 --> 00:09:58,163
YOU KEEP SPOUTING YOUR OPINIONS
TO ANYBODY WHO WILL LISTEN.

210
00:09:58,229 --> 00:10:02,000
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO PRESERVE
WHAT'S NORMAL AND SENSIBLE
IN THIS WORLD.

211
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:05,336
AND WHO KNOWS?
POLYESTER MIGHT COME BACK.

212
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,205
MAYBE YOUR OPINIONS
WILL CATCH ON,

213
00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:09,507
PEOPLE WILL THINK
YOU'RE A GENIUS.

214
00:10:09,574 --> 00:10:12,410
BUT SO FAR, NO CHANGE.

215
00:10:12,477 --> 00:10:16,147
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

216
00:10:22,453 --> 00:10:23,888
WELL, THE SWAMP SKIING IS
GETTING OFF TO A SLOW START.

217
00:10:23,955 --> 00:10:26,691
I'VE GOT THE BOAT GASSED UP,

218
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:31,563
AND I'VE GOT THE TOW ROPE ON
THERE READY TO YANK SOMEBODY
INTO THE QUAGMIRE DOWN AT
THE FAR END OF THE LAKE.

219
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:33,464
BUT SO FAR, I'VE GOT
NO CUSTOMERS.

220
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:35,500
I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.

221
00:10:35,566 --> 00:10:38,336
YOU KNOW, UNCLE RED, I THINK
I KNOW WHY YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO HAVE ANYBODY FOR THE
SWAMP SKIING.

222
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:40,338
THE GUYS' WIVES ALL
FIND OUT ABOUT IT?

223
00:10:40,405 --> 00:10:41,673
NO, NO, NO, NO.

224
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:42,974
IT'S JUNIOR SINGLETON.

225
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,542
ALL THE GUYS ARE
LISTENING TO HIM NOW.

226
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:48,046
THERE'S LOYALTY
FOR YOU, HUH?

227
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:50,481
HAS JUNIOR SINGLETON STARTED
ANOTHER LODGE, HAROLD?

228
00:10:50,548 --> 00:10:52,717
OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
VERY MUCH SO.

229
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:54,118
YEAH, IT'S REALLY COOL.
AND HE SAYS IF WE JOIN --

230
00:10:54,185 --> 00:10:57,355
IF WE JOIN, WE CAN GET,
LIKE, LODGE JACKETS,

231
00:10:57,422 --> 00:10:59,457
YOU KNOW, LIKE, MAYBE THE ONES
THE BASEBALL PLAYERS WEAR,

232
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:03,194
THOSE SILK ONES THE ROCK
AND ROLL STARS WEAR.

233
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:04,495
THAT'D BE GREAT.

234
00:11:04,562 --> 00:11:05,997
AND WE'RE GOING TO GET,
LIKE, MEMBERSHIP CARDS.

235
00:11:06,064 --> 00:11:07,565
OH, WE HAVE
MEMBERSHIP CARDS NOW.

236
00:11:07,632 --> 00:11:09,133
YEAH, BUT CHEAPY
PLASTIC ONES.

237
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,970
THESE ARE GOING TO BE LIKE
NICKEL ALLOY WITH MY PICTURE
IN THE HOLOGRAM.

238
00:11:13,037 --> 00:11:16,708
HAROLD, YOUR HEAD IS
ALREADY A HOLOGRAM.

239
00:11:16,774 --> 00:11:18,910
SEE, SEE, JUNIOR WOULDN'T
INSULT ME LIKE THAT.

240
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:20,211
HE SAYS THAT'S THE POSSUM WAY.

241
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:21,646
THAT'S SO POSSUM.

242
00:11:21,713 --> 00:11:23,347
THE SALAMANDERS ARE GOING
TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY.

243
00:11:23,414 --> 00:11:24,882
SALAMANDERS?

244
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:27,952
THAT'S THE LODGE?
IT'S CALLED SALAMANDERS?

245
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,221
YEAH, WELL SALAMANDERS
ARE COOL TOO.
UH-HUH.

246
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:32,657
BUT I'M JUST GOING TO GO
TO THAT FIRST MEETING AND
CHECK IT OUT, THAT'S ALL.

247
00:11:32,723 --> 00:11:34,325
I'M JUST, YOU KNOW,
I'LL CHECK IT OUT.
OH, YEAH.

248
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:36,360
WHAT IS JUNIOR OFFERING
YOU TO JOIN, HAROLD?

249
00:11:36,427 --> 00:11:38,596
A DIGITAL EDITING SUITE,
AND IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL.

250
00:11:38,663 --> 00:11:40,798
I WOULD HAVE EVERYTHING.

251
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:42,800
HAROLD, HE'S ONLY TRYING
TO BUY YOUR SUPPORT.

252
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:44,502
YEAH, I KNOW.

253
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:45,870
DO YOU WANT TO MAKE
A COUNTER OFFER?

254
00:11:45,937 --> 00:11:47,839
I'M A FREE AGENT.

255
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:50,208
HAROLD, YOU'RE
A FREE WILLY.

256
00:11:54,912 --> 00:11:57,715
WELL, THIS WEEK, WE'RE GOING
BACK TO WHEN WE WERE JUST
KIDS AGAIN.

257
00:11:57,782 --> 00:11:59,817
KIND OF A LAUGH.

258
00:11:59,884 --> 00:12:02,253
I'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH
PUBERTY AGAIN.

259
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,323
OH, BY GOLLY, GOOD START.
GOOD START.

260
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:08,392
YEP, BILL WANTS TO BUILD
A TREE FORT UP IN THE TREE.

261
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:11,362
WE'VE GOT THE TREE, AND WE'VE
GOT THE WOOD FOR IT.

262
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:13,998
BILL, I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
GOING TO BE ABLE TO --

263
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:15,900
OH, HE'S GOT AN IDEA.
HE'S GOT AN IDEA.

264
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:19,670
HE'S GOING TO
CLIMB UP ON ME.

265
00:12:19,737 --> 00:12:22,306
I THINK I SAW SOMETHING
LIKE THIS IN ONE OF THOSE
MOVIES ONE TIME.

266
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:25,876
NO, NO, NO, NO, SORRY.

267
00:12:25,943 --> 00:12:28,479
YEAH, SO HE'S STANDING.
HE'S A HEAVY LITTLE
FELLOW, ALL RIGHT.

268
00:12:28,546 --> 00:12:31,215
HE'S UP.
FINALLY HE'S UP.

269
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:32,984
I CAN RELAX.

270
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,919
THERE, I LOOK RELAXED.

271
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:36,954
ALL RIGHT, BILL.
GOT ANOTHER PLAN
TO GET UP THE TREE?

272
00:12:37,021 --> 00:12:38,489
WE DON'T HAVE A
LADDER OR ANYTHING.

273
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:39,824
BILL, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, BILL?

274
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,193
ANOTHER IDEA?
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

275
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:45,997
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE THAT
2x4 UP AGAINST THE TREE,
AND THEN WHAT?

276
00:12:46,063 --> 00:12:49,266
OH, HE'S GOING TO --
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
HE'S GOING TO MAKE STEPS --

277
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,835
GOING TO CUT IT UP
AND MAKE STEPS.

278
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:52,603
THERE WE GO.
THERE WE GO,
A SERIES OF STEPS.

279
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,840
OH, OH, MY GOLLY.

280
00:12:55,906 --> 00:12:59,143
ALL RIGHT, BILL, NOW, THIS IS
SOMETHING YOU YOUNGSTERS
CAN PAY ATTENTION TO.

281
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,246
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU HAVE BUDGET CUTS.

282
00:13:02,313 --> 00:13:03,714
THAT'S JUST DUMB.

283
00:13:03,781 --> 00:13:05,850
ALL RIGHT. OKAY, OKAY,
THE HIPPETY-HOPPETY.

284
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,985
THERE HE IS.
THERE HE IS.
HE'S UP THE TREE.

285
00:13:08,052 --> 00:13:09,820
OH, MY GOD...

286
00:13:09,887 --> 00:13:13,057
THERE'S THE HAMMER, BILL

287
00:13:13,124 --> 00:13:14,792
BILL, YEAH. SORRY.

288
00:13:17,027 --> 00:13:19,730
LATER THAT DAY, WE'RE
HANDING WOOD UP TO BILL,

289
00:13:19,797 --> 00:13:23,033
AND THESE HAVE ALL BEEN
PRE-CUT TO THE WIDTHS OF
THE TREE FORT HE WANTS,

290
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,004
AND HE'S PUTTING THE SPIKES
TO HIS MOUTH,

291
00:13:27,071 --> 00:13:29,073
STOP HIM FROM TALKING A
LITTLE BIT THERE,

292
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,075
AND START DRIVING.
REALLY DRIVE THAT.
DRIVE THAT.

293
00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:35,146
OH, OH, OH.
OW, OW, OH, OH.

294
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,285
I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT THE WIND.

295
00:13:41,352 --> 00:13:43,888
ALL RIGHT. SO HE'S KIND
OF CHEWING AND LEANING,
KIND OF PREOCCUPIED.

296
00:13:43,954 --> 00:13:45,756
HE'S CHEWING.
BILL YOU'RE CHEWING
ON THE NAILS.

297
00:13:45,823 --> 00:13:47,158
BILL, YOU'RE
CHEWING ON THE NAILS.

298
00:13:47,224 --> 00:13:48,926
BILL, BILL, YOU'VE EATEN THEM.

299
00:13:48,993 --> 00:13:51,195
THEY'RE GONE.
YOU'VE EATEN THEM.

300
00:13:51,262 --> 00:13:54,865
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, THERE.
GETTING A LITTLE IRON IN
THE DIET THERE, ARE WE, BILL?

301
00:13:54,932 --> 00:13:59,703
OH, MY GOSH, COUGHED
UP A NAIL, HUH?

302
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,372
THAT WAS A PARTY --

303
00:14:01,438 --> 00:14:05,976
OH, OH, WELL,
BY GOLLY, I LIKE THIS.

304
00:14:06,043 --> 00:14:08,045
A BOWL OF CHILI AND A CAN OF
NAILS, YOU CAN BUILD A COTTAGE.

305
00:14:08,112 --> 00:14:10,714
OW!

306
00:14:11,248 --> 00:14:14,485
ALL RIGHT, HE'S GOT THE THING
DONE, AND THERE HE'S GOT HIS
PLATFORM AND HE'S ALL SET.

307
00:14:14,551 --> 00:14:16,186
LOOK AT HIM.

308
00:14:16,253 --> 00:14:18,355
THERE'S THE PRIDE OF OWNERSHIP
RIGHT THERE, SITTING THERE.

309
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:20,591
BILL, OH, OH, OH, OH,

310
00:14:20,658 --> 00:14:24,929
OH, BY GOLLY, IT'S A KIND OF
AMBISWINGSTROUS KIND OF
A TREE FORT.

311
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:26,363
THE BRANCH IS LETTING GO.

312
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,232
THAT'S GOING TO LEAVE A MARK.

313
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:30,901
WELL, LET'S SEE IF
THE SAP IS RUNNING.

314
00:14:30,968 --> 00:14:35,172
OH, IT'S MORE OF AN OOZE,
KIND OF AN OOZE.

315
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:36,707
WHERE'S YOUR NECK?

316
00:14:36,774 --> 00:14:39,910
OH, THERE IT IS.

317
00:14:39,977 --> 00:14:45,282
YOU'RE GOING
TO PAY FOR THAT.

318
00:14:45,349 --> 00:14:50,554
MAN, THIS NEW SALAMANDERS LODGE
IS REALLY THROWING A MONKEY
WRENCH INTO EVERYTHING I'M
TRYING TO DO.

319
00:14:50,621 --> 00:14:54,591
HAROLD, GUESS HOW MANY GUYS
HAVE SIGNED UP FOR THE SWAMP
SKIING COMPETITION?

320
00:14:54,658 --> 00:14:58,529
SURE THING UNCLE RED.

321
00:14:58,595 --> 00:15:02,499
SO I'M GOING TO ADD
A SPECIAL EVENT TO IT.

322
00:15:02,566 --> 00:15:06,036
HAROLD IS GOING TO DO A
CANNONBALL OFF THE TOP
OF ROCK REEF POINT,

323
00:15:06,103 --> 00:15:10,007
SINGING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM,
BUCK NAKED WITH HIS
HAIR ON FIRE.

324
00:15:11,408 --> 00:15:12,543
THAT OKAY WITH YOU HAROLD?

325
00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:14,678
OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, WHATEVER.

326
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:19,216
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
I DON'T KNOW THE
NATIONAL ANTHEM.

327
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:21,885
SALAMANDER MEETING
TONIGHT, HAROLD?

328
00:15:21,952 --> 00:15:23,554
MAYBE.
UH-HUH.

329
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,856
HAVE YOU LEARNED THE SECRET
SALAMANDER HANDSHAKE YET?

330
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:27,491
WORKING ON IT.

331
00:15:27,558 --> 00:15:29,059
MEMORIZING THE MOTTO,
ARE YOU HAROLD?

332
00:15:29,126 --> 00:15:31,028
OH, YEAH. YOU KNOW HOW
LONG IT TOOK ME TO MEMORIZE

333
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:34,965
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI?

334
00:15:35,032 --> 00:15:36,867
WHAT IS THE SALAMANDER
MOTTO HAROLD?

335
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:38,101
I'LL NEVER TELL.

336
00:15:38,168 --> 00:15:39,369
I'VE BEEN SWORN TO SECRECY.

337
00:15:39,436 --> 00:15:40,604
NO. NO.

338
00:15:40,671 --> 00:15:41,839
IS THAT A SPIDER THERE?

339
00:15:41,905 --> 00:15:43,841
OH, WHAT IS IT?
IT'S A BUG!

340
00:15:43,907 --> 00:15:45,509
(CHUCKLING)

341
00:15:45,576 --> 00:15:48,645
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS
TERRA RETREATUM?

342
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:50,147
WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS,

343
00:15:50,214 --> 00:15:52,182
CLIMB UNDER A ROCK.

344
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:54,151
ALL RIGHT.
YOU WAIT HERE.

345
00:15:54,218 --> 00:15:56,520
I'LL GO GET A ROCK.

346
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:01,091
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TEENAGERS

347
00:16:01,158 --> 00:16:05,062
'CAUSE I KNOW YOUR PARENTS ARE
AFTER YOU AGAIN TO CLEAN UP
YOUR ROOM, HUH?

348
00:16:05,128 --> 00:16:08,532
THEY'RE 'IN YOUR FACE,' EH?
AS YOU WOULD SAY,

349
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:12,603
BECAUSE THAT PILE OF LAUNDRY
AND JUNK FOOD WRAPPERS AND COMIC
BOOKS IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM

350
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:15,005
JUST DEVELOPED A HEARTBEAT.

351
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:19,076
OR MAYBE A PAIR OF YOUR GYM
SOCKS GOT TOGETHER AND HAD PUPS.

352
00:16:19,376 --> 00:16:21,278
YOUR DAD, OF COURSE,
IS WARNING YOU

353
00:16:21,345 --> 00:16:24,982
THAT THAT ROOM PROVES YOU
ARE HEADED FOR A LIFE
OF TOTAL FAILURE,

354
00:16:25,048 --> 00:16:26,216
AND YOU'RE THINKING,

355
00:16:26,283 --> 00:16:27,985
HE WOULD KNOW.

356
00:16:28,051 --> 00:16:31,455
HEY, KIDS, INSTEAD OF ARGUING
WITH YOUR PARENTS,

357
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:32,823
OUTTHINK THEM.

358
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:34,758
IT'S A LOT EASIER.

359
00:16:34,825 --> 00:16:38,228
TELL THEM THE HOTTEST FIELD
IN SCIENCE TODAY IS YOUR
CHAOS THEORY,

360
00:16:38,295 --> 00:16:41,264
AND YOU'RE ON YOUR
WAY TO A Ph.D.

361
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:43,233
THOSE AREN'T DUST
BUNNIES UNDER THE BED,

362
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,205
THOSE ARE YOUR PROTOTYPES OF
FUZZY LOGIC AND SCSI DRIVES.

363
00:16:48,271 --> 00:16:49,740
THAT SMELL COMING
OUT OF THE CLOSET,

364
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:52,843
WHY, THAT'S YOUR ALTERNATIVE
FUEL PROJECT, HUH?

365
00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:54,378
YOU'RE GOING TO
SAVE THE OZONE LAYER,

366
00:16:54,444 --> 00:16:56,179
MAYBE NOT THE
EARTH'S OZONE LAYER,

367
00:16:56,246 --> 00:16:58,882
BUT AT LEAST THE PART
OVER YOUR LAUNDRY HAMPER.

368
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:01,618
AND THE NEW ANTIBIOTICS,
THEY ALL COME FROM MOULD.

369
00:17:01,685 --> 00:17:05,021
SO YOU'RE NOT A PIG,
YOU'RE A CREATIVE GENIUS.

370
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:06,189
I OUGHTA KNOW.

371
00:17:06,256 --> 00:17:08,425
I'M A REGULAR EINSTEIN MYSELF.

372
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,795
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT
PORTION OF THE SHOW

373
00:17:11,862 --> 00:17:14,865
WHERE WE EXAMINE THOSE THREE
LITTLE WORDS THAT MEN FIND
SO HARD TO SAY...

374
00:17:14,931 --> 00:17:17,200
Audience:  I DON'T KNOW.

375
00:17:17,267 --> 00:17:19,402
AH-HA!

376
00:17:19,469 --> 00:17:20,871
WAY EXCELLENT.

377
00:17:20,937 --> 00:17:22,372
JOINING MY UNCLE RED ON
THE EXPERT PORTION OF
THE SHOW TODAY

378
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,708
IS HIS BEST FRIEND IN
THE WHOLE WIDE ROOM,

379
00:17:24,774 --> 00:17:27,577
WATER TAXI CAPTAIN,
HAP SHAUGHNESSY.

380
00:17:27,644 --> 00:17:35,118
(APPLAUSE)

381
00:17:35,185 --> 00:17:39,289
OKAY, WE HAVE A VIEWER
IN GEORGIA WHO ASKS...

382
00:17:39,356 --> 00:17:44,060
"DEAR EXPERT:  I'M A BIT SELF
CONSCIOUS ABOUT MY HEIGHT.

383
00:17:44,127 --> 00:17:47,197
"I'M NOT SHORT, JUST
VERTICALLY CHALLENGED.

384
00:17:47,264 --> 00:17:51,067
"RECENTLY I READ THAT ASTRONAUTS
ACTUALLY GROW IN SPACE BY
AS MUCH AS AN INCH.

385
00:17:51,134 --> 00:17:54,838
"IS THAT TRUE? AND, IF SO, HOW
CAN I GET INTO SPACE?"

386
00:17:54,905 --> 00:17:57,240
OH, NO, NO, NO, I DON'T
THINK PEOPLE GROW IN SPACE.

387
00:17:57,307 --> 00:18:02,178
I MET THAT WILLIAM SHATNER,
AND HE'S HARDLY TALL AT ALL.

388
00:18:02,245 --> 00:18:08,151
WELL, ACTUALLY, RED, MOST
PEOPLE DO GROW IN ZERO GRAVITY.

389
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:10,820
I DON'T, BUT MOST
PEOPLE DO.

390
00:18:12,188 --> 00:18:13,890
YOU WERE IN SPACE,
WERE YOU, HAP?

391
00:18:13,957 --> 00:18:15,125
WELL, NO.

392
00:18:15,191 --> 00:18:17,294
SPACE STARTS AT
ABOUT 90 MILES UP.

393
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,930
I ONLY FLEW
88 MILES UP.

394
00:18:20,997 --> 00:18:24,567
AND WHAT WERE
YOU FLYING IN?

395
00:18:24,634 --> 00:18:27,337
A CAPE.

396
00:18:27,404 --> 00:18:37,847
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

397
00:18:37,914 --> 00:18:40,150
A CAPE?

398
00:18:40,216 --> 00:18:42,352
LIKE SUPERMAN, HUH?

399
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:45,021
NO, NOT LIKE SUPERMAN.

400
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:47,724
MINE WAS WHITE.

401
00:18:48,825 --> 00:18:52,762
YOU KNOW, THIS IS A BIT OF
A STRETCH EVEN FOR YOU,
I'M FINDING.

402
00:18:52,829 --> 00:18:56,199
WELL, I WAS WITH
THE LOCAL CIRCUS,

403
00:18:56,266 --> 00:18:59,102
HAP THE HUMAN CANNONBALL.

404
00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:01,171
WE WERE PERFORMING
IN PORT ASBESTOS,

405
00:19:01,237 --> 00:19:04,441
AND JUST AS I WAVED GOODBYE,
I SLID DOWN THE TUBE,

406
00:19:04,507 --> 00:19:07,677
A BOLT OF LIGHTENING HIT
THE CANNON AND BOOM!

407
00:19:07,744 --> 00:19:12,582
THE BLAST WAS SO STRONG, THE
WIND WAS SO POWERFUL ALL MY
CLOTHES WERE TORN OFF.

408
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:14,350
I WAS TOTALLY NAKED.

409
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:16,886
LUCKILY I WAS 88 MILES UP,
SO NO ONE COULD SEE.

410
00:19:16,953 --> 00:19:23,593
DID YOU KNOW AUSTRALIA'S
IN THE SHAPE OF A DOG'S HEAD?

411
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:29,465
YOU KNOW, NOT TOO MUCH AIR UP
THERE, I WOULDN'T THINK,
YOU KNOW?

412
00:19:29,532 --> 00:19:33,469
YOU KNOW, I KNOW THE AIRPLANES
FLY AT FOUR OR FIVE
MILES UP ONLY,

413
00:19:33,536 --> 00:19:37,807
AND THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY
PRESSURIZE THE CABINS SO
THAT PEOPLE CAN BREATH.

414
00:19:37,874 --> 00:19:41,644
OH, YEAH, THE AIR IS
VERY, VERY THIN UP THERE.

415
00:19:41,711 --> 00:19:45,915
LUCKILY I WAS JUST TRAVELLING SO
FAST, I JUST OPENED MY MOUTH AND
SCOOPED ENOUGH OXYGEN IN

416
00:19:45,982 --> 00:19:51,287
TO KEEP MY CONSCIOUSNESS.

417
00:19:51,354 --> 00:19:53,256
MY REAL WORRY WAS THE LANDING.

418
00:19:53,323 --> 00:19:56,793
I MEAN, I'M 88 MILES UP EH?
GOING A MILE A SECOND,

419
00:19:56,859 --> 00:20:00,063
SPEEDING HEADFIRST
TOWARDS EARTH.

420
00:20:00,129 --> 00:20:05,335
I GUESS THE IMPACT WOULD
CAUSE YOU TO PRETTY MUCH LOSE
WHATEVER HEIGHT YOU GAINED.

421
00:20:05,401 --> 00:20:07,370
WELL, I GOT LUCKY, HAROLD.

422
00:20:07,437 --> 00:20:10,873
I BLACKED OUT, SO I DIDN'T
TENSE UP FOR THE LANDING.

423
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:16,346
WHEN I CAME TO, I WAS JUST
OUTSIDE OF TOWN ON TOP OF
A HAYSTACK BUCK NAKED.

424
00:20:16,412 --> 00:20:19,248
WOW! EXCELLENT.

425
00:20:19,315 --> 00:20:22,285
NAKED!

426
00:20:23,553 --> 00:20:24,787
YOU BUY THAT
STORY, HAROLD?

427
00:20:24,854 --> 00:20:26,689
NOT REALLY, NO.

428
00:20:26,756 --> 00:20:28,191
YOU KNOW WHAT?

429
00:20:28,257 --> 00:20:31,427
NEITHER DID HIS EX-WIFE.

430
00:20:38,134 --> 00:20:42,605
NOW, ALL THE POSSUM LODGE
MEMBERS ARE OVER AT THE
SALAMANDER LODGE
MEETING TONIGHT,

431
00:20:42,672 --> 00:20:44,707
WHICH IS FINE.

432
00:20:44,774 --> 00:20:49,579
YOU KNOW, I CERTAINLY HAVE
NOTHING AGAINST THOSE TRAITOROUS
TWO-TIMING BACKSTABBERS.

433
00:20:49,645 --> 00:20:52,381
NO, SO, NO SENSE
HANGING AROUND, I GUESS.

434
00:20:52,448 --> 00:20:55,952
SO, BERNICE, IF YOU'RE WATCHING
THE SHOW, YOU'RE ABOUT
THE ONLY ONE AROUND.

435
00:20:56,018 --> 00:21:01,124
OH, OH, OH, BY GOLLY.

436
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,793
SALAMANDER MEETING OVER
SO SOON THERE, HAROLD?

437
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,228
OH, YEAH.
OH, YEAH.

438
00:21:05,294 --> 00:21:07,630
YEAH, YEAH, I WASN'T
GOING TO JOIN ANYWAY.

439
00:21:07,697 --> 00:21:09,131
YOU KNOW, JUST FORGET
THE WHOLE THING.

440
00:21:09,198 --> 00:21:10,533
FORGET IT.
FORGET IT.
FORGET IT.

441
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,801
OH, YEAH. I JUST WENT IN
TO CHECK IT OUT,

442
00:21:11,868 --> 00:21:13,169
SEE WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT.

443
00:21:13,236 --> 00:21:14,470
YOU KNOW, I WAS GOING
TO JOIN TO SHOW MY DISDAIN.

444
00:21:14,537 --> 00:21:16,005
I WAS DOING A
WHOLE DISDAIN THING.

445
00:21:16,072 --> 00:21:18,474
OH, REALLY?

446
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,042
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I HAD THE
DISTINCT IMPRESSION YOU WERE
GOING TO BE A SALAMANDER,
HAROLD.

447
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:23,346
YOU'VE ALREADY GOT THE
BEAK AND THE COLD, WET SKIN.

448
00:21:23,412 --> 00:21:25,715
OKAY, OKAY, YEAH, MAYBE
I WAS GOING TO JOIN.

449
00:21:25,781 --> 00:21:27,650
YEAH, MAYBE, MAYBE.

450
00:21:27,717 --> 00:21:30,786
BUT THEN JUNIOR STARTED GOING ON
ABOUT HOW MUCH IT WAS GOING TO
COST TO JOIN THE SILLY LODGE,

451
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:33,589
YOU KNOW, AND THEN HE STARTED
TELLING US HOW MUCH IT
WAS GOING TO COST

452
00:21:33,656 --> 00:21:36,225
TO BUY THOSE JACKETS AND
ALL THOSE FANCY PANTS
MEMBERSHIP CARDS,

453
00:21:36,292 --> 00:21:39,128
THEN HE STARTS HANDING OUT
DUTIES ABOUT WHO'S GOING TO
BE DOING THE CLEANING,

454
00:21:39,195 --> 00:21:43,065
AND HE'S GOT ETHICS CODES
AND DRESS CODES.

455
00:21:43,132 --> 00:21:47,136
WELL, WE WERE PRETTY MUCH
OUT THE DOOR BY THAT
TIME, PALLY RALLY.

456
00:21:47,203 --> 00:21:48,904
(POSSUM CALL)

457
00:21:48,971 --> 00:21:50,539
HEY, IT'S MEETING TIME.

458
00:21:50,606 --> 00:21:51,574
WE'RE HAVING A MEETING?

459
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:53,309
OH, YEAH,
EVERYBODY'S BACK.

460
00:21:53,376 --> 00:21:54,910
OH, GREAT.

461
00:21:54,977 --> 00:21:56,479
OKAY, YOU GO AHEAD.

462
00:21:56,545 --> 00:21:58,481
SEE IF YOU CAN GET THE GUYS
TO SIGN UP FOR THE SWAMPS.

463
00:21:58,547 --> 00:22:00,950
I'VE ALREADY PUT MY NAME RIGHT
AT THE TOP OF THE LIST THERE.

464
00:22:01,017 --> 00:22:02,685
OH, UNCLE RED, SEE,
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

465
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,986
THAT IS VERY GOOD.

466
00:22:04,053 --> 00:22:05,588
YOU'VE REALLY LEARNED
SOMETHING FROM THIS EXPERIENCE.

467
00:22:05,655 --> 00:22:08,124
WELL, DON'T GET CARRIED AWAY.
I WROTE IT IN PENCIL.

468
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:12,161
WAY YOU GO THEN.

469
00:22:12,228 --> 00:22:15,131
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT
HOME AFTER THE MEETING.

470
00:22:15,197 --> 00:22:16,732
WE'VE GOT NO MONEY
AND NO AGENDA,

471
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,567
SO IT SHOULD BE A QUICK ONE.

472
00:22:18,634 --> 00:22:21,971
BUT, YOU KNOW, WITH ME
SOMETIMES THE QUICK ONES
ARE THE BEST ONES.

473
00:22:22,671 --> 00:22:24,540
TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

474
00:22:24,607 --> 00:22:26,675
