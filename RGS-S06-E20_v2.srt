1
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:05,171
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

2
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:06,840
HERE'S THE MAN WHO SAID

3
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:09,509
NO MAN'S AN ISLAND
IF HE HAS A BOAT...

4
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:11,778
YOUR HERO, MY UNCLE, RED GREEN!

5
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,713
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,982
(Applause and cheering)

7
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,517
HUH? HUH?

8
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:19,185
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

9
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:21,287
WELL, BIG NEWS THIS WEEK.

10
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,490
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD.

11
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:25,792
MOOSE THOMPSON'S
SELLING HIS HOUSE.

12
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,360
MOOSE THOMPSON'S
MOVING?

13
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:29,262
THAT'S USUALLY A CONDITION

14
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,131
WHEN YOU SELL YOUR HOUSE.

15
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,799
YEAH, MOOSE SAYS

16
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,001
HE NEEDS MORE SPACE,
APPARENTLY.

17
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,137
HE'S NOT MARRIED,
HE DOESN'T HAVE KIDS.

18
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,805
WHY DOES
HE NEED SPACE?

19
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,741
MAYBE HE'S GOING UP
ANOTHER PANTS SIZE.

20
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,076
MOOSE BETTER BE CAREFUL.

21
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,211
REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS
CAN BE COMPLICATED.

22
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:46,813
NOTHING AGAINST MOOSE, BUT

23
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,382
HE'S NOT THE SHARPEST KNIFE
IN THE DRAWER.

24
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,251
HE SHOULD GET HIMSELF

25
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:53,419
A REALLY GOOD
REAL ESTATE AGENT.

26
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:56,089
HE'S HIRED THE BEST AGENT
IN POSSUM LAKE.

27
00:00:56,155 --> 00:00:58,091
WAHHHH! WHO?

28
00:00:58,157 --> 00:01:00,093
(Audience laughing)

29
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,561
OH, YIKES.

30
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:06,533
(Horns honking)

31
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,135
(Geese honking)

32
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,639
(Quacking)

33
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:17,877
(Red): YOU'RE LOOKIN'
AT SEGMENTS

34
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:19,879
FROM THIS PARTICULAR SHOW,

35
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,247
THE MAIN MESSAGE BEING,

36
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,883
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT CHANGING THE CHANNEL.

37
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,552
TO MAKE SENSE
OUT OF THIS PROGRAMME,

38
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:27,887
YOU GOTTA GIVE IT

39
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:29,589
YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.

40
00:01:36,562 --> 00:01:38,531
HAVE YOU GOT AN AD
IN THE PAPER?

41
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,899
I'M WAY AHEAD OF YOU.

42
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,968
LOOKIT, CIRCLED 'ER
RIGHT THERE.

43
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,771
"HOUSE FOR SALE --
CALL RED GREEN."

44
00:01:44,837 --> 00:01:47,840
(Audience laughing)

45
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:49,175
THAT'S IT?

46
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,510
YEAH.

47
00:01:50,576 --> 00:01:51,978
A LITTLE VAGUE, ISN'T IT?

48
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,213
MIGHT WANT TO BE
DESCRIBE HOW IT LOOKS.

49
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,015
I DIDN'T WANT TO SCARE PEOPLE.

50
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:58,451
BESIDES, ANOTHER LINE
COST ANOTHER DOLLAR.

51
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,853
HOW MUCH ARE YOU CHARGING MOOSE
FOR THIS

52
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,389
PSEUDO-SEMI-PROFESSIONAL
SERVICE OF YOURS?

53
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,958
THE STANDARD RATE, HAROLD --
THE 6% COMMISSION.

54
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:08,161
IT'S THE EASIEST MONEY
YOU CAN MAKE.

55
00:02:08,227 --> 00:02:09,495
THINK ABOUT THIS, OK?

56
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:12,865
I FIND A BUYER,
SELL THE HOUSE IN AN HOUR.

57
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,868
IT'S A $100,000 HOME
SO YOU MAKE SIX GRAND.

58
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:19,505
YOU WORK AN EIGHT-HOUR DAY...
THAT'S ALMOST $50,000.

59
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:22,642
THAT'S $250,000 A WEEK,
$1 MILLION A MONTH...

60
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:26,312
THAT'S $12 MILLION A YEAR
YOU'RE LOOKIN' AT, HAROLD!

61
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,816
YEAH, RIGHT, YOU'RE GONNA WORK
AN EIGHT-HOUR DAY.

62
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:31,317
(Audience laughing)

63
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,519
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

64
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:36,722
(Red): LATER ON, WE GOT
THE ADVENTURE WITH BILL.

65
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,491
WHAT ARE WE DOING, HAROLD?

66
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:39,826
HAROLD?

67
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:41,961
AH, IT'S PING-PONG!

68
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:44,330
YOU LOOKING FOR HAROLD?
THERE HE IS.

69
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,766
THE BOYS SET UP
THE PING-PONG TABLE.

70
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,069
HAROLD'S GOTTEN IT SET UP,
LEVEL AND EVERYTHING.

71
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:53,072
BILL'S GOT THE NET --
KEEPS IT IN HIS PANTS.

72
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,774
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?

73
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,108
CATCHIN' ANY?

74
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,277
GOTTA THROW
THE SMALL ONES BACK, BILL.

75
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,781
THAT'S A BIT OF A NET...
MORE OF A COD NET, I THINK.

76
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:03,382
OOH! OOH! BY GOLLY!

77
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:04,817
YOU GOT ONE, HUH?

78
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,786
THEY BITING? THEY BITING?

79
00:03:06,852 --> 00:03:08,254
(Laughing)

80
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,622
ALL RIGHT, HE'S GOT--

81
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,625
THAT MAY BE A LITTLE...
TOO MUCH "A NET"...

82
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,628
YOU KNOW, AS FRANKIE AVALON
USED TO SAY.

83
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,096
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

84
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,498
YOU HAVE A PLAN?
HE
 HAS A PLAN?

85
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:21,434
OH, THAT'S VERY RELAXING.

86
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,302
WHAT ARE WE DOING, BILL?

87
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,870
ANOTHER PING-PONG TABLE?

88
00:03:24,937 --> 00:03:26,539
HOW MANY PING-PONG TABLES

89
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:28,140
DID YOU BRING?

90
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:32,178
RATHER THAN SHORTEN THE NET,
THEY'RE GONNA WIDEN THE TABLE.

91
00:03:32,244 --> 00:03:36,482
THAT'S THE KIND OF THINKING
THAT GOT THEM WHERE THEY ARE...

92
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,050
OUT BEHIND THE LODGE.

93
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:39,618
START 'ER UP, BOYS!

94
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:43,422
THE COMPETITION IS-- HAROLD'S
GOT THE GOOD STUFF TODAY.

95
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,091
TAKE A POINT -- ONE-NOTHING.

96
00:03:45,157 --> 00:03:46,425
OK, BILL,

97
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:48,194
I'D SAY MORE DEFENCE.

98
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,529
THERE WE GO -- THAT'S IT!

99
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:52,765
ONE MORE -- THERE WE ARE.

100
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:55,301
STAY TUNED.

101
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:57,269
OHHHHH

102
00:03:57,336 --> 00:04:00,606
MY FAVOURITE TOOL
IS THE ADJUSTABLE WRENCH

103
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:03,943
IT'S ALWAYS
CLOSE AT HAND

104
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:07,279
MIND YOU, SCREWDRIVERS
AND CHISELS ARE OK, TOO

105
00:04:07,346 --> 00:04:11,584
BUT THEY HURT A LOT MORE
WHEN YOU SIT ON 'EM

106
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,918
THIS IS THE BIG ONE!

107
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:15,454
FOR OUR GRAND PRIZE,
A BAG OF RAD-HOSES

108
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,124
FROM JULIO'S STEAM-ROOM
AND ENGINE FLUSH,

109
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,393
UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS
TO GET DOUGIE FRANKLIN

110
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,728
TO SAY THIS WORD.

111
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,630
"LOVE".

112
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,298
(Laughing)

113
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:27,800
AND GO!

114
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:30,536
DOUGIE, WHEN A MAN
MEETS A WOMAN,

115
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,538
AND THAT STARTS AN ATTRACTION

116
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,941
WHICH DEVELOPS INTO
AN AFFECTION AND THEN COMES...

117
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:37,943
... ANTIBIOTICS.

118
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,812
(Audience laughing)

119
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,748
I'M SORRY, RED,
DID YOU SAY "INFECTION"?

120
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,383
NO, NO, NO,
"AFFECTION".

121
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,151
I'M SORRY -- START OVER.

122
00:04:46,218 --> 00:04:49,555
ALL RIGHT, WHEN A MAN
AND WOMAN FEEL STRONGLY

123
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,590
ABOUT EACH OTHER,
THEY FALL IN...

124
00:04:51,657 --> 00:04:52,925
... BED.

125
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,660
NO, NO, BEFORE THAT.

126
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,328
UH... THE
BACK SEAT?

127
00:04:56,395 --> 00:04:58,998
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE FEELING.

128
00:04:59,064 --> 00:05:02,635
... OF TOUCHING... GROPING...
SMACKING THE HAND.

129
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:06,605
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE EMOTION:
THIS IS THE PERSON FOR YOU.

130
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:07,973
OH, THAT'S DESPERATION.

131
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,308
NO, NO.
NO?

132
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:13,012
A MAN AND WOMAN GET MARRIED
AND HAVE KIDS.

133
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:15,514
THEY'RE DEEPLY
IN...
... DEBT.

134
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:19,051
NO, NO, WHEN A MAN AND WOMAN
STAY TOGETHER,

135
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:21,286
IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE IN...

136
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:23,622
... A RUT.

137
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:26,525
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU CAN'T GUESS THIS WORD!

138
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,595
WELL, RED, NO WOMAN
HAS EVER MADE ME SAY IT,

139
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,464
AND EVEN THOUGH
YOU'RE MIGHTY GOOD-LOOKIN',

140
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:33,799
NEITHER WILL YOU!

141
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:36,969
(Laughing and applause)

142
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,871
THIS WEEK ON "HANDYMAN CORNER",

143
00:05:38,937 --> 00:05:41,974
WE'RE GONNA COMBINE TWO THINGS
THAT ALL MEN LOVE --

144
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,076
GASOLINE ENGINES
AND HITTING THINGS.

145
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:46,712
WE'RE GONNA BUILD
OUR VERY OWN BATTING CAGE.

146
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,447
GOTTA LOVE A BATTING CAGE...

147
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,882
ALL THE FUN OF BASEBALL

148
00:05:49,948 --> 00:05:52,184
WITH NONE OF
THAT DARN RUNNING-AROUND.

149
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,519
WHAT DO WE NEED?

150
00:05:53,585 --> 00:05:56,755
WE NEED SOMETHING
TO THROW THE BALLS AT US,

151
00:05:56,822 --> 00:05:58,891
SO I'M THINKIN'... LAWN MOWER.

152
00:05:58,957 --> 00:06:01,827
I'VE SEEN SOME ROCKS
COME OUT OF THIS BABY

153
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:05,497
THAT ANY MAN WOULD LOVE TO TAKE
INTO THE UPPER DECK.

154
00:06:05,564 --> 00:06:07,766
ALL I GOTTA DO IS
MODIFY THIS PUPPY

155
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,301
TO CHUCK BASEBALLS.

156
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:12,371
I WANT TO DULL THE BLADES
ON THIS UNIT

157
00:06:12,437 --> 00:06:15,574
BECAUSE WE ARE BUILDING
A BATTING CAGE,

158
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:16,909
NOT A CUISINART.

159
00:06:16,975 --> 00:06:20,412
YOU COULD FILE THE EDGES
OR GRIND 'EM DOWN,

160
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,782
BUT I PREFER TO RUN OVER
SOME TIRE IRONS.

161
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:26,418
WHOA! THAT SOUNDED GOOD.

162
00:06:26,485 --> 00:06:27,786
AHHH!

163
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:29,288
OH, BY GOLLY!

164
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:31,089
YEAH, OH, THAT'S TERRIFIC.

165
00:06:31,156 --> 00:06:34,893
WAIT A MINUTE --
THAT'S NOT MY LAWN MOWER.

166
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,229
WELL, IT IS NOW, I GUESS.

167
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:40,599
YOU WANT TO HAVE THE BASEBALLS
COME OUT THIS HOLE.

168
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,502
YOU GOTTA SEAL THE BOTTOM
OF THE LAWN MOWER.

169
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,772
I SUGGEST YOU GRAB
THAT CHUNK OF KITCHEN COUNTER

170
00:06:46,838 --> 00:06:48,840
FROM WHEN YOU PUT THE SINK IN.

171
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:51,877
THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY
TO TELL YOUR WIFE

172
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:54,313
HOW SMART YOU WERE
TO HANG ON TO IT.

173
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:56,548
SOMETHING YOU GOTTA BE
AWARE OF.

174
00:06:56,615 --> 00:06:59,418
THE END OF THAT BLADE
WILL BE TRAVELLING

175
00:06:59,484 --> 00:07:01,687
IN EXCESS OF 100 MILES AN HOUR,

176
00:07:01,753 --> 00:07:04,256
SO REALLY SOCK
THE DUCT TAPE TO 'ER.

177
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:07,893
YOU KNOW ME -- SAFETY FORCED.

178
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,861
AS WITH MOST THINGS IN NATURE,

179
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:11,897
YOU HAVE AN INPUT
AND AN OUTPUT.

180
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,366
ON THIS UNIT, ALL I HAVE
IS THE OUTPUT,

181
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:16,101
FOR THE BALLS TO COME OUT.

182
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:21,239
WHAT I NEED IS AN INPUT,
A HOLE ON THE OTHER SIDE

183
00:07:21,306 --> 00:07:24,609
FOR THE BALLS TO GO IN.

184
00:07:24,676 --> 00:07:26,478
BEAUTY.

185
00:07:26,545 --> 00:07:28,747
HERE'S AN EXTRA
ADDED FEATURE...

186
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:32,451
AUTOMATIC BALL RETURN,
SO YOU'RE NOT GRABBING BALLS

187
00:07:32,517 --> 00:07:34,886
OUT OF SOUP BOWLS
AND EYE-SOCKETS.

188
00:07:34,953 --> 00:07:38,056
I'VE ADDED THIS SHEET
ONTO THE GRASS-CATCHER

189
00:07:38,123 --> 00:07:39,891
SO WHEN THE BALL GOES IN,

190
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,427
SHE FILTERS INTO
THE GRASS-CATCHER,

191
00:07:42,494 --> 00:07:45,363
INTO THE INPUT,
AND BECOMES MY NEXT PITCH.

192
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,532
ALL RIGHT, JUST START 'ER UP.

193
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,235
(Grunting)

194
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:53,338
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

195
00:07:53,405 --> 00:07:55,740
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

196
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:57,809
PLAY BALL!

197
00:08:00,145 --> 00:08:01,413
(Glass breaking)

198
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,548
I'LL SLOW 'ER DOWN TO "MULCH".

199
00:08:06,818 --> 00:08:09,087
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

200
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:11,423
HEY, PITCHER, COME ON!

201
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,758
OH, MAN!

202
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:16,728
THAT'S OUT OF HERE!

203
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:20,832
STAY TUNED -- WHATEVER THIS IS,
WE GOT LOTS MORE OF IT.

204
00:08:25,503 --> 00:08:28,773
WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING
ALL OF US ARE LOOKING FOR

205
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,976
AS WE GO DOWN
THE HIGHWAY OF LIFE...

206
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:32,711
A HALF-DECENT PARKING SPOT.

207
00:08:32,777 --> 00:08:36,448
I CALL IT "THE SEVEN STAGES
OF PARKING".

208
00:08:36,514 --> 00:08:38,750
STAGE ONE, YOU'RE A KID.

209
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:41,953
ALL YOU HAVE TO PARK
IS YOUR BUTT.

210
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,689
THEN YOU HIT STAGE TWO --
YOU'RE A TEENAGER.

211
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:46,358
YOU'RE PARKING WITH A GIRL

212
00:08:46,424 --> 00:08:49,494
WHO HAS A GOOD CHANCE
OF BEING YOUR FUTURE WIFE...

213
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:52,764
FOLLOWED BY STAGE THREE --
YOU'RE MARRIED WITH KIDS.

214
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:54,966
NOW YOU'RE PARKING
AT McDONALD'S...

215
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:57,102
THE ONE WITH THE PLAY AREA.

216
00:08:57,168 --> 00:09:00,338
THEN WE HAVE STAGE FOUR --
KIDS ARE GROWN,

217
00:09:00,405 --> 00:09:04,476
AND THEY'RE WORKING...
COINCIDENTALLY, AT McDONALD'S.

218
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:07,212
SO YOU'VE NOW GOT YOURSELF
A SPORTS CAR

219
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:09,014
AND YOU'RE CAUGHT PARKING

220
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,984
WITH A GIRL WHO HAS NO CHANCE
OF BEING YOUR FUTURE WIFE.

221
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:15,987
THIS LEADS IMMEDIATELY
TO STAGE FIVE --

222
00:09:16,054 --> 00:09:18,490
NOW YOU'RE PARKING
IN THE GARAGE,

223
00:09:18,556 --> 00:09:20,492
WHERE YOU'RE ALSO LIVING.

224
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:23,628
NOW COMES STAGE SIX --
YOU'RE OLD.

225
00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:26,998
NO LICENCE, NO CAR,
NO PARKING SPOT.

226
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:29,501
THEN WE HAVE STAGE SEVEN...

227
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:31,002
YOU'RE PARKED.

228
00:09:31,069 --> 00:09:32,670
(Audience laughing)

229
00:09:32,737 --> 00:09:35,006
I'M TALKING PERMANENTLY.

230
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:37,876
YOU GOT YOUR OWN PARKING SPOT.

231
00:09:37,942 --> 00:09:40,512
EVEN HAS YOUR NAME OVER IT.

232
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:43,915
SO THE LESSON HERE IS,
LIFE IS SHORT, ALL RIGHT?

233
00:09:43,982 --> 00:09:46,818
GRAB YOUR SHIFTER,
MOVE IT OUT OF "PARK",

234
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:48,486
AND THROW IT INTO GEAR!

235
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:50,588
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YA.

236
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:52,524
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

237
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,026
(Applause)

238
00:09:55,093 --> 00:09:57,929
DID YOU GET A PICTURE
OF MOOSE'S HOUSE?

239
00:09:57,996 --> 00:10:00,698
I WANT TO PUT IT
IN TOMORROW'S PAPER.

240
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:02,500
YEAH, SORT OF --
THIS IS

241
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:03,868
JUST THE FIRST ROLL.

242
00:10:03,935 --> 00:10:06,337
I'M TESTING THE LENS,
THE APERTURE...

243
00:10:06,404 --> 00:10:08,506
IT'S WHAT WE PHOTOGRAPHERS CALL

244
00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:09,874
A TEST ROLL.

245
00:10:09,941 --> 00:10:12,410
THIS IS 24 PICTURES
OF YOUR NOSE.

246
00:10:12,477 --> 00:10:16,314
I GUESS THE LENS MUST BE
ON THE BACK ON THIS MODEL.

247
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:18,316
IT TOOK ME
A WHILE

248
00:10:18,383 --> 00:10:20,184
BUT I GOT THE RIGHT ANGLE.

249
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:24,289
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET THOSE
45-GALLON DRUMS OF AXLE GREASE

250
00:10:24,355 --> 00:10:26,791
AND THE THREE FRIDGES
ON HIS PORCH.

251
00:10:26,858 --> 00:10:29,561
NO, THOSE AREN'T
REAL SELLING POINTS.

252
00:10:29,627 --> 00:10:31,963
I ASKED MOOSE TO TAKE HIS
UNDERWEAR OFF THE CLOTHES-LINE.

253
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,965
THAT'S UNDERWEAR ON THERE?

254
00:10:34,032 --> 00:10:36,134
I THOUGHT HE'D BOUGHT
A SAILBOAT.

255
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:45,910
(Siren)

256
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,084
POSSUM 911 -- STATE YOUR
CARD MEMBERSHIP NUMBER, PLEASE!

257
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:54,419
UH, 8-9, UH, 2-3-4.

258
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:55,753
OH, HI, TIMMY.

259
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,256
WHO THE HECK'S THAT?
MY FRIEND, TIMMY.

260
00:10:58,323 --> 00:11:01,192
HOW DID ONE OF YOUR NERD
DORK-BALL FRIENDS

261
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:03,628
GET TO BE A MEMBER
OF POSSUM LODGE?

262
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:05,063
HE PAID
ALL HIS DUES.

263
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:07,532
HOW YOU DOIN'?
HOW CAN WE HELP YOU?

264
00:11:07,598 --> 00:11:09,634
I'M STUCK IN A NEBULA ZONE.

265
00:11:09,701 --> 00:11:11,769
MY SECTOR CHARGE IS AT 30%.

266
00:11:11,836 --> 00:11:15,573
THE GALAXY BOMBERS ARE BLOCKING
ALL THE TELEPORTS

267
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,042
AND MY CRYSTAL'S ON SHORT-LIFE.

268
00:11:18,109 --> 00:11:19,377
AW, COOL!

269
00:11:19,444 --> 00:11:21,079
HE'S PLAYING
MY FAVOURITE

270
00:11:21,145 --> 00:11:22,747
VIDEO GAME,
"GALAMAXIA."

271
00:11:22,814 --> 00:11:24,682
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A PROBLEM

272
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:27,318
WE HAVE A LOT OF
HERE AT POSSUM LODGE.

273
00:11:27,385 --> 00:11:28,853
WHAT LEVEL
ARE YOU ON?

274
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,356
LEVEL 42-- OHHHH! HE JUST
PHASED MY NOVA FORCE.

275
00:11:32,423 --> 00:11:34,358
AW, LEVEL 42!

276
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:35,860
WAHHAHHH!

277
00:11:35,927 --> 00:11:38,362
HOW LONG
YOU BEEN PLAYING?

278
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:41,365
I STARTED TWO DAYS AGO --
I HAVEN'T STOPPED.

279
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:43,935
YOU EVER HEARD OF GIRLS, TIM?

280
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:47,472
DEATH TO YOU AND YOUR HAIRY
GORP-SUCKING SCUM ROCKETS!

281
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:49,273
HE'S TALKING
ABOUT THE GAME.

282
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,175
ONLY ONE SUPER-CHARGER LEFT,

283
00:11:51,242 --> 00:11:53,845
AND I'LL HAVE ALL THE PIECES
TO THE ORACLE.

284
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:55,179
AW, YOU'RE
DOING GREAT.

285
00:11:55,246 --> 00:11:56,714
YOU DON'T
NEED HELP.

286
00:11:56,781 --> 00:11:59,217
I DO -- I'VE BEEN PLAYING
FOR TWO DAYS

287
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:01,152
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PAUSE

288
00:12:01,219 --> 00:12:03,287
AND I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

289
00:12:03,354 --> 00:12:05,523
TO PAUSE IT,
JUST PRESS "DELETE"--

290
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,525
OHHHHH!

291
00:12:07,592 --> 00:12:09,660
NEVER MIND... TOO LATE.

292
00:12:09,727 --> 00:12:14,232
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
TOO LATE FOR THE GAME, RIGHT?

293
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:18,336
YEAH, MY NEUTRO PACK WAS
AT THE DANGER LEVEL.

294
00:12:18,402 --> 00:12:22,540
MY POWER CANNISTER
COULDN'T TAKE THE PRESSURE.

295
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:25,843
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
THE GAME, RIGHT?

296
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,480
IT'S... "MALE CALL"!

297
00:12:29,547 --> 00:12:31,349
(Laughing)

298
00:12:31,415 --> 00:12:32,883
THAT REALLY HURTS!

299
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:36,153
OK, OUR FIRST LETTER
GOES AS FOLLOWS...

300
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,521
UH... "DEAR RED,

301
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:41,359
"MY HUSBAND WHISTLES
ALL THE TIME, ON PURPOSE.

302
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:45,162
"HE CERTAINLY ENJOYS IT
BUT NOBODY ELSE DOES.

303
00:12:45,229 --> 00:12:47,398
"I'VE EVEN NOTICED BIRDS
LAUGHING AT HIM.

304
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:49,066
"HOW CAN I GET HIM TO DESIST?

305
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:52,236
"IS THERE A POLITE WAY OF
SAYING, 'DEAR, STOP WHISTLING

306
00:12:52,303 --> 00:12:55,272
"'OR I'LL HAVE TO STAPLE
YOUR LIPS TO YOUR EYEBROWS'?

307
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:57,241
"SIGNED,
ACHY-BREAKY EARS."

308
00:12:57,308 --> 00:12:59,977
THIS IS A REAL ODDBALL ONE,
YOU KNOW,

309
00:13:00,044 --> 00:13:03,481
'CAUSE WHISTLING'S USUALLY
A SIGN OF HAPPINESS.

310
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:05,816
BUT HE'S MAKING HER UNHAPPY.

311
00:13:05,883 --> 00:13:08,252
YOU CAN'T MAKE YOURSELF HAPPY

312
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:10,755
IF YOU'RE MAKING
SOMEONE ELSE UNHAPPY.

313
00:13:10,821 --> 00:13:13,357
YOU MANAGE TO DO IT
ON A REGULAR BASIS.

314
00:13:13,424 --> 00:13:15,159
STOP A GUY FROM WHISTLING...

315
00:13:15,226 --> 00:13:16,961
WELL, MAYBE CHANGE HIS DIET.

316
00:13:17,027 --> 00:13:19,563
ONCE YOU STUFF HIS FACE
FULL OF CRACKERS,

317
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,198
THAT MIGHT SLOW HIM DOWN.

318
00:13:21,265 --> 00:13:22,900
REMEMBER UNCLE JACK?

319
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:24,535
REMEMBER UNCLE JACK?

320
00:13:24,602 --> 00:13:26,103
HIS NOSE WHISTLED.

321
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,905
HOW DID HE EVER STOP?

322
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:31,642
HE STARTED WEARING ONE OF THOSE
THINGS THAT SWIMMERS WEAR.

323
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:33,344
YEAH, A BIKINI.

324
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,546
(Audience laughing)

325
00:13:35,613 --> 00:13:38,816
IT WORKED BUT COST HIM HIS JOB
AT THE POST OFFICE.

326
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:42,786
I'M THINKING IF YOU CAN'T STOP
THIS GUY FROM WHISTLING,

327
00:13:42,853 --> 00:13:45,489
MAYBE SPEND TIME
AWAY FROM EACH OTHER.

328
00:13:45,556 --> 00:13:48,959
MAYBE SEND YOUR HUSBAND
ON A HOLIDAY BY HIMSELF.

329
00:13:49,026 --> 00:13:51,395
YEAH, WHISTLE HIM OFF
TO WHISTLER!

330
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:53,063
(Giggling)

331
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:56,166
HE COULD VISIT HIS MOTHER --
"WHISTLER'S MOTHER"!

332
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:57,501
(Laughing)

333
00:13:57,568 --> 00:13:59,069
I SAID "WHISTLER'S MOTHER"

334
00:13:59,136 --> 00:14:01,505
'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE...
HE COULD GO.

335
00:14:01,572 --> 00:14:02,873
(Audience laughing)

336
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,176
WELL, ULTIMATELY, I THINK,
IF YOU CAN'T GET HIM

337
00:14:06,243 --> 00:14:10,014
TO GO YOUR WAY, MAYBE YOU
GOTTA CHANGE YOUR ATTITUDE.

338
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,749
THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY.

339
00:14:11,815 --> 00:14:16,086
AS LONG AS HE'S WHISTLING, HE'S
NOT SMOKING, DRINKING, EATING,

340
00:14:16,153 --> 00:14:17,922
AND YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS.

341
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:20,824
MAYBE THIS LADY'S BEHAVIOUR
IS THE PROBLEM.

342
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:24,128
MAYBE SHE'S GIVING HIM
TOO MUCH TO WHISTLE ABOUT.

343
00:14:24,194 --> 00:14:25,462
(Laughing)

344
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:27,464
(Giggling)

345
00:14:27,531 --> 00:14:29,533
NOT JUST WHISTLING DIXIE THERE!

346
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,803
CAN YOU WHISTLE THAT THEME
TO "ANDY OF MAYBERRY"?

347
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,140
NO, BUT I CAN WHISTLE
THIS ORANGE OFF YOUR FOREHEAD.

348
00:14:36,206 --> 00:14:37,541
(Audience laughing)

349
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:38,976
(Red): MEANWHILE,

350
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:40,577
BACK AT THE-- OOOH!

351
00:14:40,644 --> 00:14:43,213
OH, BOY! YOU ALL RIGHT, HAROLD?

352
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,282
SUCK IT UP -- THERE YOU GO.

353
00:14:45,349 --> 00:14:47,184
YOU'RE FINE, YOU'RE FINE.

354
00:14:47,251 --> 00:14:49,420
YOU'RE FINE -- YOU ALL RIGHT?

355
00:14:49,486 --> 00:14:52,823
THEY'RE PLAYING PING-PONG,
AND, OH, BOY, CRAFTY TRICKS!

356
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,025
OH, GOLLY!

357
00:14:55,092 --> 00:14:57,861
MAYBE TOO MUCH GREASE
ON THE HAIR, HAROLD?

358
00:14:57,928 --> 00:14:59,663
THAT MAKES IT HARDER, EH?

359
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,465
BILL'S RACKING UP POINTS.

360
00:15:01,532 --> 00:15:03,300
YOU MIGHT WANT TO HIT ONE

361
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:06,336
AT SOME POINT, HAROLD...
OH, THERE WE GO.

362
00:15:06,403 --> 00:15:08,238
HIT YOUR OWN RACQUET, EH?

363
00:15:08,305 --> 00:15:10,607
IT IS NOW -- OH, IT'S HANDBALL!

364
00:15:10,674 --> 00:15:13,610
LOOK, HAROLD'S WINNING, 20-19.

365
00:15:13,677 --> 00:15:15,579
ONE MORE POINT, HAROLD!

366
00:15:15,646 --> 00:15:18,048
COME ON, SUCK IT UP, HAROLD.

367
00:15:18,115 --> 00:15:19,850
I DIDN'T MEAN LITERALLY!

368
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:21,218
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

369
00:15:21,285 --> 00:15:22,719
WHOSE POINT IS THAT?

370
00:15:22,786 --> 00:15:24,087
HOW DOES THAT WORK?

371
00:15:24,154 --> 00:15:27,124
I THINK THE BALL
HAS TO TOUCH THE GROUND.

372
00:15:27,191 --> 00:15:29,159
THAT MAY TAKE ANOTHER WEEK.

373
00:15:29,226 --> 00:15:31,462
OH... UH, HAROLD,
ARE YOU ALL--

374
00:15:31,528 --> 00:15:34,064
BILL, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO JUST GET OVER--

375
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:35,766
GO THAT WAY, GO THAT WAY.

376
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,100
THIS WAY, THIS WAY.

377
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:38,802
GO THAT WAY, GO THAT WAY.

378
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:40,404
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S GOOD.

379
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:43,740
THAT'S GOOD-- NO, NO,
IT'S NOT DOWN THERE YET.

380
00:15:43,807 --> 00:15:45,809
IT'S STILL UP IN HIS THROAT.

381
00:15:45,876 --> 00:15:48,045
HERE WE GO -- DO WHAT YOU CAN.

382
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:49,546
THIS IS THE-- OHHHH!

383
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:51,481
OH, THE HEIM-PONG MANOEUVRE.

384
00:15:51,548 --> 00:15:52,816
OH, BY GOLLY.

385
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:55,152
IS THAT EVER DISGUSTING
TO WATCH.

386
00:15:55,219 --> 00:15:56,486
BY GOLLY-- OHHH!

387
00:15:56,553 --> 00:15:57,821
OH, MY GOSH!

388
00:15:57,888 --> 00:15:59,156
OHHH!

389
00:15:59,223 --> 00:16:01,858
TAKE IT EASY --
THAT'S OUR LAST BALL.

390
00:16:01,925 --> 00:16:03,193
COME ON, YOU GUYS.

391
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,462
OH, BOY, THAT'S GOTTA GET 'ER.

392
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:07,130
YOU ALL RIGHT, HAROLD?

393
00:16:07,197 --> 00:16:08,498
BALL COME OUT YET?

394
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:10,968
ALL RIGHT, ONE MORE COAT.

395
00:16:11,034 --> 00:16:12,502
THAT OUGHT TO GET 'ER.

396
00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:13,837
OH, BOY!

397
00:16:13,904 --> 00:16:15,672
YEAH, YEAH, HERE, BILL.

398
00:16:15,739 --> 00:16:18,075
YOU KNOW WHAT TO TRY? EXACTLY.

399
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:21,011
THERE WE GO!
HEY, THAT'S HAROLD'S POINT!

400
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:24,147
THAT'S YOUR GAME, HAROLD!
THAT'S YOUR GAME!

401
00:16:24,214 --> 00:16:26,450
OH, MAN! HE'S A NATURAL,
ISN'T HE?

402
00:16:26,516 --> 00:16:28,051
ADD YOUR OWN NOUN.

403
00:16:28,118 --> 00:16:31,321
HERE'S A PUPPET OF ME
FROM A VIEWER IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.

404
00:16:31,388 --> 00:16:33,023
HAROLD HAD A HAND IN THIS.

405
00:16:37,294 --> 00:16:38,762
YOU ARE SURE POPULAR!

406
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:41,865
PHONE HASN'T STOPPED RINGING
ALL AFTERNOON!

407
00:16:41,932 --> 00:16:43,500
MOOSE THOMPSON CALLED.

408
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:45,135
WHEN?
WHAT DID HE WANT?

409
00:16:45,202 --> 00:16:47,571
10:30 -- "HAVE YOU SOLD
MY HOUSE YET?"

410
00:16:47,637 --> 00:16:50,040
10:55 -- "HAVE YOU
SOLD MY HOUSE YET?"

411
00:16:50,107 --> 00:16:53,076
11:15 -- "ANY OFFERS?"
11:20 -- "SO WHAT GOES?"

412
00:16:53,143 --> 00:16:55,011
11:25 -- "SOLD MY HOUSE YET?"

413
00:16:55,078 --> 00:16:58,248
11:45 -- "DO I STILL HAVE
A HOUSE OR WHAT?"

414
00:16:58,315 --> 00:17:00,884
ALL RIGHT, I GET THE IDEA.

415
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:03,286
MOOSE THOMPSON'S
A PAIN IN THE NECK.

416
00:17:03,353 --> 00:17:06,289
HE'S ONLY HAD HIS HOUSE
ON THE MARKET ONE DAY

417
00:17:06,356 --> 00:17:10,060
AND HE'S PRESSURING ME BECAUSE
HE'S BOUGHT A NEW PLACE.

418
00:17:10,127 --> 00:17:11,762
YOU BETTER SELL HIS PLACE.

419
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:13,230
YOU HAD AN OPEN HOUSE?

420
00:17:13,296 --> 00:17:15,866
I HAD THE HOUSE OPEN
BUT NOBODY WOULD GO IN.

421
00:17:15,932 --> 00:17:18,735
I THINK AN ONSHORE BREEZE
WOULD HAVE HELPED.

422
00:17:18,802 --> 00:17:20,804
BUSTER HADFIELD WAS INTERESTED,

423
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:24,407
BUT WAS CONCERNED ABOUT
UREA FORMALDEHYDE IN THE WALLS.

424
00:17:24,474 --> 00:17:26,943
I SAID, "NO, WHAT YOU SEE
IS DAYLIGHT."

425
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,845
YOU KNOW WHAT, THEN?

426
00:17:28,912 --> 00:17:30,714
MAYBE YOU SHOULD FIX IT UP.

427
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,382
WAY AHEAD
OF YOU, HAROLD.

428
00:17:32,449 --> 00:17:33,850
WE GOT IT
ALL PLANNED.

429
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:36,386
SOME PAINT, WALLPAPER,
CEILING JOISTS,

430
00:17:36,453 --> 00:17:39,689
SOME I-BEAM, SUPPORTING WALL,
SOME ELECTRICITY...

431
00:17:39,756 --> 00:17:43,226
WHAT WE REAL ESTATE PROS
CALL "T.L.C."

432
00:17:43,293 --> 00:17:44,728
T.L.C. --

433
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:47,731
TORCH IT... LEVEL IT...
AND CART IT AWAY.

434
00:17:47,797 --> 00:17:49,566
(Audience laughing)

435
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:51,801
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT PORTION,

436
00:17:51,868 --> 00:17:54,271
WHERE WE EXPLORE
THOSE THREE WORDS

437
00:17:54,337 --> 00:17:56,907
THAT MEN FIND
SO DIFFICULT TO SAY...

438
00:17:56,973 --> 00:17:58,909
(Audience):
"I DON'T KNOW!"

439
00:17:58,975 --> 00:18:00,243
SO TRUE.

440
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:03,813
JOINING MY UNCLE RED
ON THE EXPERT PORTION

441
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,749
IS MY UNCLE RED, NATCH,

442
00:18:05,815 --> 00:18:08,685
AND HIS BEST FRIEND,
DALTON HUMPHREY!

443
00:18:08,752 --> 00:18:10,186
(Applause and cheering)

444
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:11,788
ALL RIGHT.

445
00:18:11,855 --> 00:18:13,890
OUR VIEWER ASKS...
"DEAR EXPERTS,

446
00:18:13,957 --> 00:18:16,359
"SOMETIMES, WHEN MY HUSBAND
GOES OUT,

447
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:19,963
"I'LL ASK HIM TO PICK SOMETHING
UP FOR ME THAT I NEED.

448
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,298
"HE ALWAYS FORGETS --
WHY IS THAT?"

449
00:18:22,365 --> 00:18:25,201
WELL, MAYBE HE'S GOT
ONE OF THOSE

450
00:18:25,268 --> 00:18:29,506
EXTREMELY RELIABLE AND ACCURATE
ONE-ITEM MEMORIES.

451
00:18:29,572 --> 00:18:34,210
YOU'VE MADE THE MISTAKE
OF GIVING HIM ITEM NUMBER TWO.

452
00:18:34,277 --> 00:18:36,079
OR IT COULD BE THAT

453
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:41,518
THE ITEM IN QUESTION IS OF
A HIGHLY EMBARRASSING NATURE.

454
00:18:41,584 --> 00:18:43,186
(Audience laughing)

455
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:46,756
LIKE WHAT? WHAT'S
AN EMBARRASSING NATURE?

456
00:18:46,823 --> 00:18:49,826
WELL, SEE, UH,
SOMETHING THAT'S, UH,

457
00:18:49,893 --> 00:18:52,429
OF A SO HIGHLY PERSONAL NATURE

458
00:18:52,495 --> 00:18:55,532
THAT IT'S, UH...
BEST LEFT UNSPOKEN.

459
00:18:55,598 --> 00:18:59,536
MAN, YOU GOT ME CURIOUS NOW.

460
00:18:59,602 --> 00:19:02,472
WELL, ALL RIGHT, RED, OK!

461
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:05,308
ALL RIGHT,
I'M TALKING ABOUT, UM...

462
00:19:06,643 --> 00:19:09,579
... A RECIPE MAGAZINE
OR A COMB.

463
00:19:09,646 --> 00:19:11,447
(Audience laughing)

464
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:13,683
A COMB IS EMBARRASSING?

465
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,820
HOW DO YOU COMB YOURSELF,
DALTON?

466
00:19:16,886 --> 00:19:20,023
LOOK, MAYBE IT'S NOT
EMBARRASSING ON THE SURFACE,

467
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:22,225
BUT IF THAT'S ALL
YOU'RE BUYING...

468
00:19:22,292 --> 00:19:26,196
PEOPLE START
TO LOOK AT YOU FUNNY, YOU KNOW?

469
00:19:26,262 --> 00:19:29,465
THEY THINK YOU'VE BEEN SENT
FOR SOMETHING PERSONAL

470
00:19:29,532 --> 00:19:33,002
AND YOU CHICKENED OUT AND
BOUGHT A MAGAZINE OR A COMB!

471
00:19:33,069 --> 00:19:35,171
YOU KNOW?

472
00:19:35,238 --> 00:19:38,174
SO YOU'RE STANDING
IN THE CHECK-OUT LINE...

473
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:40,343
SWEAT'S POURING DOWN YOUR FACE

474
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:43,880
'CAUSE YOU KNOW EVERYBODY
IN THE STORE IS SMIRKING

475
00:19:43,947 --> 00:19:47,984
AND TRYING TO IMAGINE WHAT
PERSONAL THING YOU GOT SENT FOR

476
00:19:48,051 --> 00:19:50,587
THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE
THE GUTS TO BUY!

477
00:19:50,653 --> 00:19:55,959
(Audience laughing)

478
00:19:56,025 --> 00:19:58,194
YOU MEAN LIKE PANTYHOSE?

479
00:19:58,261 --> 00:19:59,529
OHHHH!

480
00:19:59,596 --> 00:20:01,931
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES, HAROLD!

481
00:20:01,998 --> 00:20:03,433
HAVE YOU
NO SHAME?

482
00:20:03,499 --> 00:20:07,170
OK, DALTON, BUT WHAT IF
YOU WENT FOR MILK?

483
00:20:07,236 --> 00:20:10,139
OH, SURE, SURE!
ON YOUR WAY TO THE COOLER,

484
00:20:10,206 --> 00:20:14,110
YOU HAVE TO GO PAST THAT RACK
FULL OF FILTHY MAGAZINES!

485
00:20:14,177 --> 00:20:16,245
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE...

486
00:20:16,312 --> 00:20:22,752
(Audience laughing)

487
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:25,254
... I WOULD IMAGINE.

488
00:20:25,321 --> 00:20:28,257
BUT WHAT IF YOU WERE JUST
MAILING A LETTER?

489
00:20:28,324 --> 00:20:29,625
OHHHH...

490
00:20:29,692 --> 00:20:30,993
A LETTER.

491
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:35,331
YOU KNOW THE KIND OF SLEAZY
REPUTATION A LETTER HAS,

492
00:20:35,398 --> 00:20:37,467
ESPECIALLY IF THAT LETTER

493
00:20:37,533 --> 00:20:40,903
HAPPENS TO BE OF
PARTICULARLY EUROPEAN --

494
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:45,775
DARE I SAY FRENCH? --
PERSUASION.

495
00:20:45,842 --> 00:20:47,376
(Audience laughing)

496
00:20:47,443 --> 00:20:51,514
YOU ARE REALLY STEPPING
OFF THE DOCK ON THIS ONE.

497
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:53,749
BOY, OH, BOY,
MR. HUMPHREY!

498
00:20:53,816 --> 00:20:57,920
WITH THAT ATTITUDE, YOUR WIFE
CAN'T SEND YOU FOR ANYTHING!

499
00:20:57,987 --> 00:20:59,255
BINGO.

500
00:20:59,322 --> 00:21:00,623
(Laughing)

501
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,291
OHHHHH!

502
00:21:02,358 --> 00:21:05,294
(Applause)

503
00:21:07,296 --> 00:21:10,233
I TELL YA, THERE IS NO FIGURING
SOME PEOPLE.

504
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:12,001
SO, THE
RENOVATION

505
00:21:12,068 --> 00:21:14,437
OF MOOSE THOMPSON'S HOUSE
GO PER USUAL?

506
00:21:14,504 --> 00:21:16,005
IT WAS A DISASTER.

507
00:21:16,072 --> 00:21:17,940
THAT'S A "YES".

508
00:21:18,007 --> 00:21:19,275
(Laughing)

509
00:21:19,342 --> 00:21:22,512
I TOLD MOOSE,
"LET'S TAKE OUT THE ONE WALL."

510
00:21:22,578 --> 00:21:23,946
THEY ALL COME DOWN.

511
00:21:24,013 --> 00:21:26,282
THEY MUST HAVE BEEN CONNECTED.

512
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:28,217
THEY SURE DIDN'T LOOK IT.

513
00:21:28,284 --> 00:21:30,620
NOW MOOSE HAS NO HOME AT ALL.

514
00:21:30,686 --> 00:21:33,723
IT'S MORE OF A BASEMENT
WITH A ROOF ON IT.

515
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:35,258
IT WILL NEVER
SELL NOW.

516
00:21:35,324 --> 00:21:36,626
OH, REALLY, HUH?

517
00:21:36,692 --> 00:21:38,761
SOLD WITHIN THE HOUR, HAROLD.

518
00:21:38,828 --> 00:21:40,830
APPARENTLY, THE LOT
WAS WORTH MORE

519
00:21:40,897 --> 00:21:43,099
WITHOUT MOOSE'S HOUSE ON IT.

520
00:21:43,165 --> 00:21:46,269
SAVES THE NEW OWNER
HAVING TO RENT A BULLDOZER.

521
00:21:46,335 --> 00:21:47,670
SO IS THAT

522
00:21:47,737 --> 00:21:50,039
A FAT COMMISSION CHEQUE
IN YOUR SHIRT?

523
00:21:50,106 --> 00:21:51,540
NO.

524
00:21:51,607 --> 00:21:52,875
NOTHING.

525
00:21:52,942 --> 00:21:54,543
(Audience laughing)

526
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,846
JUNIOR SINGLETON
BOUGHT THE PLACE

527
00:21:56,912 --> 00:21:58,648
SO IT WAS A NO-CASH DEAL.

528
00:21:58,714 --> 00:22:01,450
GAVE HALF A SCHOOL BUS
AS A DOWN-PAYMENT

529
00:22:01,517 --> 00:22:04,153
AND PAYS A "K"-CAR A MONTH
FOR FIVE YEARS.

530
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:08,057
SO MY COMMISSION WAS
A BROKEN SNOWMOBILE AND A GOAT.

531
00:22:08,124 --> 00:22:10,626
THE GOAT ATE THE SNOWMOBILE
AND DROPPED DEAD.

532
00:22:10,693 --> 00:22:11,961
(Laughing)

533
00:22:12,028 --> 00:22:14,697
SO YOUR COMMISSION'S
OUT OF COMMISSION.

534
00:22:14,764 --> 00:22:16,699
(Giggling)

535
00:22:16,766 --> 00:22:18,034
(Possum squeal)

536
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,735
MEETING TIME,
UNCLE RED.

537
00:22:19,802 --> 00:22:22,004
AWAY YOU GO, HAROLD... GO NOW.

538
00:22:22,071 --> 00:22:23,406
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

539
00:22:23,472 --> 00:22:26,008
I'M COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

540
00:22:26,075 --> 00:22:28,811
I'M GONNA GET OUT
OF THE REAL ESTATE BUSINESS.

541
00:22:28,878 --> 00:22:31,747
ANYBODY WHO LOOKS LIKE I DO
AND THINKS LIKE I DO

542
00:22:31,814 --> 00:22:33,249
WON'T GET MANY OFFERS.

543
00:22:33,315 --> 00:22:36,719
IF YOU GIVE ME ONE, I THINK
WE CAN CLOSE THAT DEAL TONIGHT.

544
00:22:36,786 --> 00:22:39,255
THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

545
00:22:39,321 --> 00:22:42,324
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND HAROLD AND THE GANG,

546
00:22:42,391 --> 00:22:44,260
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

547
00:22:44,326 --> 00:22:46,395
(Applause)

548
00:22:46,462 --> 00:22:56,272
(Possum squeal)

549
00:22:56,338 --> 00:22:58,274
(Harold): ALL RIGHT!

550
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,176
STAND UP! STAND UP!

551
00:23:00,242 --> 00:23:02,778
I DIDN'T SAY "SIMON SAYS".

552
00:23:02,845 --> 00:23:06,215
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

553
00:23:06,282 --> 00:23:08,217
(Red): SIT DOWN, GUYS.

554
00:23:08,284 --> 00:23:10,319
(Harold): THE LOCAL PIZZERIA

555
00:23:10,386 --> 00:23:13,222
WILL NO LONGER HONOUR
THE 30-MINUTES-OR-FREE

556
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:16,292
IF YOU'RE PHONING
FROM MOBILE HOMES.
