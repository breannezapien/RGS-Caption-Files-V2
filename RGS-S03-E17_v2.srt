5
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:30,830
ON TODAY'S SHOW HAROLD IS

6
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:31,664
GOING TO TALK ABOUT SEX

7
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:33,099
OF ALL THINGS,

8
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:34,134
BILL IS GOING TO WORK

9
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:35,001
ON HIS SAILBOAT,

10
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:35,635
AND I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU

11
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,737
HOW TO DISCOURAGE TAILGATERS.

12
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:38,304
(RIFLE SHOTS FIRED)

13
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:39,305
(GLASS SHATTERING)

14
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:44,110
>>HAROLD: AND NOW HERE'S

15
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,712
A LIVING LEGEND,

16
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:46,479
A GIANT WHO EVEN MAKES

17
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,881
PAUL BUNYAN LOOK SMALL

18
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,016
IN OVERSEAS TELEVISION

19
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:50,850
SALES ANYWAY.

20
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:51,651
HERE HE IS THE STAR OF OUR SHOW,

21
00:00:51,651 --> 00:01:02,428
MR. RED GREEN!

22
00:01:02,428 --> 00:01:04,197
>>RED: THANK YOU,

23
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:05,465
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

24
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:06,933
INTERESTING INTRO THERE HAROLD,

25
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:07,600
I'VE NEVER BEEN COMPARED TO

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,369
PAUL BUNYAN BEFORE.

27
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:10,103
I GUESS THAT MAKES YOU

28
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:13,473
HIS PET OX BLUE.

29
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:14,240
>>HAROLD: WELL CAN HIS

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,013
PET OX BLUE DO THIS?

31
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:21,080
>>RED: YEAH IF HE

32
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,751
EATS ENOUGH BRAN.

33
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,551
WELL YESTERDAY WE ALL GOT

34
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:27,887
BORED AGAIN SO WE FIGURED

35
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:28,588
POSSUM LODGE COULD USE

36
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,723
A FEW IMPROVEMENTS,

37
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:31,591
WE KICKED AROUND THE IDEA

38
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,959
OF MAKING A WATER PURIFICATION

39
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,361
SYSTEM OR MAYBE A COMPOSTER OR

40
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,130
SOME KIND OF A RECYCLING UNIT,

41
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,097
AND THAT STRUCK US AS A BIT

42
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:40,433
OF A YAWN SO WE DECIDED

43
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:45,638
TO MAKE A SUBMARINE PEN.

44
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:47,373
>>HAROLD: A SUBMARINE PEN?

45
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:48,107
WHAT DO WE NEED A

46
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:48,941
SUBMARINE PEN FOR?

47
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:50,643
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A SUBMARINE.

48
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,945
>>RED: WELL WE MAY HAVE SOME

49
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:53,980
DAY AND MOST OF OUR BOATS

50
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,449
ARE ALMOST SUBMARINES.

51
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,250
>>HAROLD: YEAH THAT'S RIGHT,

52
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,084
THAT'S TRUE YEAH.

53
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:58,851
>>RED: OLD MAN SEDGEWICK

54
00:01:58,851 --> 00:01:59,619
MADE A SUBMARINE QUITE

55
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,620
A FEW YEARS AGO BACK WHEN

56
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,521
HE WAS KNOWN AS MIDDLE AGED

57
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:07,326
MAN SEDGEWICK BUT IT HAD

58
00:02:07,326 --> 00:02:08,494
AN ENGINEERING FLAW IN IT,

59
00:02:08,494 --> 00:02:09,328
HE PUT A SCREEN DOOR ON HER

60
00:02:09,328 --> 00:02:12,131
AND SHE SANK, BUT HE ENDED UP

61
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:14,734
DONATING IT TO THE LODGE.

62
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:16,035
>>HAROLD: OH IS THAT WHY

63
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:16,869
THE SEPTIC TANK HAS A

64
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:17,703
CONNING TOWER AND A PERISCOPE?

65
00:02:17,703 --> 00:02:20,173
>>RED: YEAH.

66
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:21,240
SO THE FIRST STEP IN BUILDING

67
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,942
OUR SUBMARINE PEN WAS TO GET

68
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,310
STINKY TO FIRE UP HIS CEMENT

69
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,278
TRUCK AND DROP OFF A LOAD

70
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,345
OF CONCRETE.

71
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:27,380
AND WE WERE ALL RIGHT IN

72
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,314
THE MIDDLE OF POURING IT

73
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,382
AND THEN WELL, WE TOOK A BREAK

74
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:30,583
TO GO INTO THE LODGE AND WATCH

75
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:34,086
GILLIGAN'S ISLAND AND YOU KNOW

76
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:34,954
HOW MEN KIND OF GLAZE OVER WHEN

77
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:37,890
THEY'RE WATCHING TELEVISION.

78
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:38,558
THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW

79
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:39,425
IT'S 9 O'CLOCK THIS MORNING,

80
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:40,326
THE CEMENT HAS HARDENED

81
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,830
AS SOLID AS A ROCK.

82
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,997
SO NOW WHAT WE'VE GOT IS

83
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:46,065
A CONCRETE TRUCK AND 60 FEET

84
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,700
OF POURING TROUGH CEMENTED

85
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,270
TO THE SHORELINE.

86
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,805
BUT JUNIOR SINGLETON SAYS HE

87
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:53,706
CAN GET THE WHOLE MESS OUT

88
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:54,507
OF THERE WITH ABOUT

89
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,675
4 FEET OF STRING.

90
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,709
>>HAROLD: HOW DOES THAT WORK?

91
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,311
>>RED: THAT'S THE FUSE

92
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,379
FOR THE DYNAMITE HAROLD.

93
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:01,514
>>HAROLD: WELL I'LL BE SPENDING

94
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,548
THE REST OF THE DAY IN MY ROOM.

95
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:03,349
>>RED: GOLLY WE SHOULD

96
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,685

112
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:40,820
'HANDYMAN CORNER' WE'RE GOING

113
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,687
TO SHOW YOU A FEW SIMPLE

114
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:43,089
PROJECTS THAT WILL MAKE OUR

115
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:46,625
HIGHWAY SAFER, AT LEAST FOR YOU.

116
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,094
YOU KNOW MOST MEN ARE

117
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,595
DEFENSIVE DRIVERS, JUST ASK

118
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:50,696
THEM ABOUT THEIR DRIVING,

119
00:03:50,696 --> 00:03:52,932
SEE HOW DEFENSIVE THEY GET.

120
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:53,599
BUT THE KIND OF DRIVER THAT

121
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,767
REALLY STEAMS MY CLAMS

122
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,902
IS THE TAILGATER.

123
00:03:56,902 --> 00:03:58,204
YOU KNOW THE GUY,

124
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,305
HE'S USUALLY IN A LITTLE CAR,

125
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:00,139
IT'S USUALLY A RED ONE

126
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,006
AND IT'S ABOUT THE SIZE

127
00:04:01,006 --> 00:04:02,408
OF A SHOEBOX AND SMELLS

128
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,275
AROUND THE SAME

129
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:04,710
AND HE'S ALWAYS OH 18 YEARS OLD.

130
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,379
SOMETIMES THEY'RE 18 AND A HALF,

131
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:08,347
BUT YOU VERY RARELY SEE

132
00:04:08,347 --> 00:04:09,949
ANYONE OVER 25 TAILGATING

133
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,784
BECAUSE THEY TEND TO HAVE REAL

134
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:14,286
SHORT CAREERS AND YOU KNOW YOU

135
00:04:14,286 --> 00:04:15,387
CAN'T REASON WITH TAILGATERS

136
00:04:15,387 --> 00:04:16,188
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T HEAR YOU

137
00:04:16,188 --> 00:04:18,591
OVER THAT HOLE IN THEIR MUFFLER

138
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,391
OR ELSE THEY GOT THAT STEREO

139
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:20,960
THUMPING, PUMPING WITH THE

140
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,328
SUPER TURBO BASS ON THERE.

141
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,629
AND THE LITTLE, THIN SHEET METAL

142
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:24,663
ON THE JAPANESE CARS ARE JUST

143
00:04:24,663 --> 00:04:25,731
PUMPING AND PUMPING AND GRINDING

144
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:26,532
LIKE THAT AND MAKE YOU SICK

145
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,467
TO YOUR STOMACH.

146
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:29,702
THERE IS ONE THING

147
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,270
TAILGATERS DO UNDERSTAND, FEAR.

148
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,072
HERE'S AN IDEA ONE OF

149
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,074
OUR VIEWERS SENT IN.

150
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:37,810
YOU TAKE A LUNCH PAIL OR

151
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:43,782
A THERMOS OR EVEN A BRIEFCASE,

152
00:04:43,782 --> 00:04:44,650
OR ALL 3 IF YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

153
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,887
MADE OF MONEY AND YOU SCREW

154
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:50,256
THEM RIGHT TO THE ROOF OF YOUR

155
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:57,196
CAR WITH THESE DRYWALL SCREWS.

156
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:58,564
ALL RIGHT THOSE ARE REALLY

157
00:04:58,564 --> 00:04:59,431
ON THERE, THEY'RE NOT GOING

158
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:02,701
ANYWHERE, OF COURSE NOW YOUR

159
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:04,270
TAILGATER DOESN'T KNOW THAT,

160
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,137
HE FIGURES YOU JUST PUT THESE

161
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:06,105
UP HERE WHILE YOU KNOW REACHED

162
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,673
AROUND IN YOUR POCKETS FOR

163
00:05:07,673 --> 00:05:09,141
YOUR CAR KEYS AND THEN ONCE YOU

164
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:10,509
FOUND THEM YOU JUST GOT IN AND

165
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:11,810
YOU DROVE AWAY AND YOU FORGOT

166
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,213
ABOUT THEM, SO I'LL TELL YOU,

167
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,214
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET A

168
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:16,582
TAILGATER IF YOU'RE DOING 60

169
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,550
MILES AN HOUR DOWN THE HIGHWAY,

170
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,752
THESE PEOPLE TEND TO STAY BACK.

171
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,920
HERE I'LL SHOW YOU ANOTHER

172
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,757
TRICK THAT WORKED REAL WELL,

173
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:25,658
THE FIRST STEP IS YOU GOT

174
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:29,528
TO REMOVE YOUR BACK BUMPER.

175
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:30,663
NOW THAT MAY TAKE A LITTLE

176
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,730
LONGER FOR THOSE FUSS BUDGETS

177
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:32,531
OUT THERE WHO HAD THE

178
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:34,266
THING RUST PROOFED.

179
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:35,367
ALL RIGHT NOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING

180
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:36,568
TO NEED TO FINISH THIS PROJECT

181
00:05:36,568 --> 00:05:39,371
IS A BALL OF TWINE OF SOME KIND

182
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:41,507
AND A COUPLE OF OLD PENS

183
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,274
AND A ROLL OF THE HANDYMAN

184
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:46,645
SECRET WEAPON, DUCT TAPE.

185
00:05:46,645 --> 00:05:48,247
ALL RIGHT NOW I'VE REATTACHED

186
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:49,314
THE BUMPER WITH THESE LITTLE

187
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:50,883
PIECES OF STRING WHICH ARE

188
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:51,817
ACTUALLY STRONGER THAN

189
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:53,018
THE OLD RUST BALLS THAT

190
00:05:53,018 --> 00:05:53,952
WERE HOLDING THEM ON IN

191
00:05:53,952 --> 00:05:55,287
THE FIRST PLACE.

192
00:05:55,287 --> 00:05:57,523
NOW THESE ARE ALL SLIPKNOTS,

193
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,223
IT'S IMPORTANT,

194
00:05:58,223 --> 00:06:00,058
YOU'LL SEE WHY IN A MINUTE.

195
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:00,692
NOW TO KEEP THE STRINGS ALL

196
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:01,660
SEPARATE WE RUN THEM UP THROUGH

197
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,896
THESE OLD BALLPOINT PENS,

198
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,063
YOU CAN GET BALLPOINT PENS

199
00:06:05,063 --> 00:06:05,931
REAL CHEAP ESPECIALLY IF YOU

200
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:06,565
WAIT UNTIL THE GUY'S WHO'S

201
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:07,332
GOING TO CHECK YOUR OIL

202
00:06:07,332 --> 00:06:08,200
AT THE GAS STATION

203
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,234
YOU JUST TAKE THEM,

204
00:06:09,234 --> 00:06:10,435
THEY DON'T MIND.

205
00:06:10,435 --> 00:06:11,403
AND THEN TAKE THEM ALL UP

206
00:06:11,403 --> 00:06:14,606
HERE AND TIE THEM IN A KNOT

207
00:06:14,606 --> 00:06:16,008
AND GET DOWN AND HOOK THEM

208
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:18,944
RIGHT INTO YOUR DASHBOARD.

209
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:20,712
SO NOW YOU'RE DRIVING ALONG,

210
00:06:20,712 --> 00:06:23,515
YOU'RE DOING MAYBE 40, 50 MILES

211
00:06:23,515 --> 00:06:25,350
BELOW THE SPEED LIMIT AND

212
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,753
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT SOME

213
00:06:27,753 --> 00:06:28,720
GOOFBALL IS COMING RIGHT UP

214
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,622
TO YOUR BACK BUMPER,

215
00:06:30,622 --> 00:06:31,456
I MEAN JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE IN

216
00:06:31,456 --> 00:06:32,391
THE PASSING LANE I GUESS AND

217
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,458
YOU'RE GETTING A LITTLE TICKED

218
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,359
BUT JUST WAIT, JUST WAIT,

219
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,360
I'M WATCHING THE REARVIEW MIRROR

220
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,128
AND WHEN HE GETS UP REAL CLOSE

221
00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:37,095
AND YOU CAN SEE THE WHITES

222
00:06:37,095 --> 00:06:37,963
OF HIS EYES, JUST PULL

223
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:41,300
AND THE BUMPER FALLS

224
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,001
RIGHT OFF THERE.

225
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:43,869
IT USUALLY GETS INTO A KIND OF

226
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:45,304
AN END OVER END THING AND WILL

227
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,439
GET UNDER HIS CAR AND PUNCTURE

228
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,942
ALL OF HIS TIRES AND PROBABLY

229
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,143
RIP OFF HIS OIL TANK THERE AND

230
00:06:51,143 --> 00:06:52,244
GET RIGHT THROUGH THE GASOLINE

231
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:54,313
THAT'S GOING TO AND THEN

232
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:55,080
YOU REALLY SEE THE WHITES

233
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,881
OF HIS EYES.

234
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:57,516
BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO

235
00:06:57,516 --> 00:06:58,750
TRY A LITTLE MORE SUBTLE TACTIC

236
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,418
THERE IS ANOTHER THING

237
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:00,152
YOU CAN USE

238
00:07:00,152 --> 00:07:01,119
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A CAN

239
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,055
OF SPRAY PAINT AND A, YUP,

240
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,656

241
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:06,591
OF THE HANDYMAN SECRET WEAPON,

242
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:07,960
PUT YOUR GLASSES ON HAROLD,

243

DUCT TAPE, AND WE'LL SHOW YOU

244

AN OLD PIANO, DON'T BOTHER!

246
00:07:13,832 --> 00:07:14,733

247
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:15,767
LITTLE WHILE SO WHY DON'T

248
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:16,601
I JUST RIG THIS UP AND YOU

249
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:17,469
GO BACK TO THE SHOW,

250
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:18,236
WHEN I GET HER ALL DONE

251
00:07:18,236 --> 00:07:20,872
AND WE'LL HAVE YOU BACK

252
00:07:20,872 --> 00:07:21,573
AND I'LL SHOW YOU SOMETHING

253
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:22,140
REALLY NEAT,

254
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:22,974
(PAINT CAN SPRITZ)

255
00:07:22,974 --> 00:07:23,875
OH FOR GOD'S SAKE!

256
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:28,413
>>HAROLD: AND NOW IT'S THAT

257
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:29,414
PART OF THE SHOW WHERE WE

258
00:07:29,414 --> 00:07:30,115
EXPOSE THOSE 3 LITTLE WORDS

259
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:31,650
THAT MEN FIND IT SO

260
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,784
DIFFICULT TO SAY,

261
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:34,720
'I DON'T KNOW'.

262
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,587
AND HERE TO PROVE THAT POINT

263
00:07:35,587 --> 00:07:36,354
ONCE AGAIN ON 'THE EXPERTS'

264
00:07:36,354 --> 00:07:37,489
PORTION OF THE SHOW IS MY

265
00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:38,557
UNCLE RED AND HIS GOOD FRIEND,

266
00:07:38,557 --> 00:07:51,169
MR. BOB STUYVESANT.

267
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:54,206
ALL RIGHTY, 'DEAR EXPERTS,

268
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:55,307
AT WORK RECENTLY I PUNCHED

269
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:56,908
OUT A COLLEAGUE OVER

270
00:07:56,908 --> 00:07:59,177
THE LAST CUP OF COFFEE,

271
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:00,045
WHEN MY BOSS SUGGESTED

272
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:01,012
I GET MY BLOOD PRESSURE

273
00:08:01,012 --> 00:08:05,350
CHECKED I HEAD BUTTED HIM,

274
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,184
THEN THE COURT APPOINTED

275
00:08:06,184 --> 00:08:07,219
A PSYCHIATRIST TO EXAMINE ME

276
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:08,220
AND HE TOLD THE JUDGE I WAS

277
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,589
OVERSTRESSED AND FRUSTRATED,

278
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:11,490
THIS TICKED ME OFF SO MUCH THAT

279
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,426
I PUNCHED HIS LIGHTS OUT TOO.

280
00:08:14,426 --> 00:08:15,594
NOW I REALIZE THAT I REALLY

281
00:08:15,594 --> 00:08:17,229
DO HAVE TO RELAX AND UNWIND

282
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:17,929
ESPECIALLY SINCE I WANT

283
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:22,968
TO MAKE EARLY PAROLE.'

284
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:23,835
>>RED: WELL YOU KNOW I'VE

285
00:08:23,835 --> 00:08:24,502
ALWAYS FOUND IT DIFFICULT

286
00:08:24,502 --> 00:08:26,371
TO RELAX MYSELF,

287
00:08:26,371 --> 00:08:27,606
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN KIND OF

288
00:08:27,606 --> 00:08:29,174
A HIGH STRUNG, GO, GO, GO,

289
00:08:29,174 --> 00:08:31,877
KIND OF A GUY.

290
00:08:31,877 --> 00:08:32,644
>>HAROLD: YOU KNOW IF YOU

291
00:08:32,644 --> 00:08:33,511
REALLY WANT TO RELAX AND UNWIND

292
00:08:33,511 --> 00:08:34,579
I FIND THAT HUMOUR OFTEN TIMES

293
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:35,981
WORKS AND THAT WAS AN EXAMPLE,

294
00:08:35,981 --> 00:08:39,251
SAY, THEY SAY LAUGHTER IS

295
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:44,256
THE BEST MEDICINE.

296
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:46,391
KNOCK, KNOCK.

297
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:47,459
>>RED: WHO'S THERE?

298
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,928
>>HAROLD: HILARY CLINTON.

299
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:53,531
>>BOB: GOLF, THAT'S RELAXING,

300
00:08:53,531 --> 00:08:55,367
WHEN I WANT TO UNWIND AND

301
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:56,735
I THINK THAT A GOOD GAME OF

302
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:58,703
GOLF HELPS ME RELIEVE ALL MY

303
00:08:58,703 --> 00:09:02,774
TENSION AND MY FRUSTRATION.

304
00:09:02,774 --> 00:09:03,408
>>RED: YOU FINALLY PLAYED

305
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:07,012
A GOOD GAME OF GOLF BOB?

306
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:07,779
>>HAROLD: REMEMBER THAT TIME

307
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:08,847
YOU LIKE WHIPPED 9 STROKES

308
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:11,649
IN A ROW ON THAT SAME BALL,

309
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:12,350
YOU ATTACKED YOUR GOLF

310
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,020
CART WITH THE DRIVER.

311
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,720
>>BOB: NOW HAROLD YOU KNOW IN

312
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,023
THE LETTER, THERE'S A PERFECT

313
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:18,757
EXAMPLE OF HOW YOU HAVE TO

314
00:09:18,757 --> 00:09:20,258
LET OUT YOUR TENSION,

315
00:09:20,258 --> 00:09:21,426
I THINK THAT YOU KNOW HITTING

316
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:22,794
MY DRIVER ON THE GOLF

317
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:26,431
CART WAS VERY LETHARGIC,

318
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:27,032
I LET OUT A LOT OF PENT

319
00:09:27,032 --> 00:09:31,836
UP EMOTION, IT JUST MADE ME

320
00:09:31,836 --> 00:09:33,738
FEEL A LITTLE BETTER THAT'S ALL,

321
00:09:33,738 --> 00:09:34,539
I MEAN REALLY,

322
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:38,042
WHAT DID IT COST ME?

323
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:40,779
A GOLF CART AND MY

324
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:43,848

>>BOB: NO HE STOPPED

328
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:55,326
CADDYING ALTOGETHER ACTUALLY.

329
00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:56,928
>>RED: DO YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK

00:09:56,928 --> 00:09:57,695
YOUR PROBLEM IS BOB,

331
00:09:57,695 --> 00:09:58,463
YOU'RE STANDING TOO CLOSE

332
00:09:58,463 --> 00:10:05,203
TO YOUR BALL AFTER YOU HIT IT.

333
00:10:05,203 --> 00:10:06,771
>>BOB: PARDON ME!

334
00:10:06,771 --> 00:10:07,438
WELL I THINK I'M GOING TO GO

335
00:10:07,438 --> 00:10:08,139
OUTSIDE AND HIT A BUCKET

336
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:12,744
OF BALLS TO KINGDOM COME,

337
00:10:12,744 --> 00:10:24,022

>>HAROLD: WHEW!

339
00:10:29,494 --> 00:10:30,161
WELL USUALLY HUMOUR

340
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:32,931
RELEASES TENSION.

341
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:33,565
>>RED: YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS

342
00:10:33,565 --> 00:10:34,265
WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE

343
00:10:34,265 --> 00:10:36,834
A SENSE OF HUMOUR.

344
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:37,869
>>HAROLD: KNOCK, KNOCK.

345
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:40,538

346
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:42,807
>>RED: OKAY I GOT HER ALL

347
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:43,975
RIGGED UP HERE AND ONCE AGAIN

348
00:10:43,975 --> 00:10:45,209
LET'S IMAGINE THAT I'M

349
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:46,778
CRUISING DOWN THE HIGHWAY

350
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:48,246
JUST MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS,

351
00:10:48,246 --> 00:10:49,580
KIND OF DRIFTING FROM LANE

352
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,249
TO LANE WITH MY MOOD SWINGS

353
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:52,617
AND SO ON AND SUDDENLY ALL

354
00:10:52,617 --> 00:10:53,651
OF A SUDDEN I GOT MYSELF

355
00:10:53,651 --> 00:10:55,353
A TAILGATER, WELL WHAT I'VE

356
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:57,522
GOT HERE IS, UP ON THE DASHBOARD

357
00:10:57,522 --> 00:10:58,923
I'VE GOT THESE PIANO KEYS

358
00:10:58,923 --> 00:11:01,626
CONNECTED TO SOME OLD

359
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:02,994
EMERGENCY BRAKE CABLES,

360
00:11:02,994 --> 00:11:04,329
WHO USES THE EMERGENCY BRAKE?

361
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:05,396
AND THEY GO DOWN TO THE BACK

362
00:11:05,396 --> 00:11:07,031
AND HOOK INTO THE PIANO HAMMERS

363
00:11:07,031 --> 00:11:07,965
BUT THEY'RE NOT PLAYING STRINGS

364
00:11:07,965 --> 00:11:09,500
ANY MORE, THEY'RE PLAYING

365
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,135
CANS OF SPRAY PAINT.

366
00:11:11,135 --> 00:11:14,005
SO NOW I SAY PICK A COLOUR,

367
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:15,707
WELL WHITE KEY, WHITE PAINT,

THE FRONT OF HIS CAR.

390
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:49,640
WE KNOW HE CAN'T DRIVE

391
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,008
BUT HE CAN PROBABLY READ

392
00:11:51,008 --> 00:11:54,645
AND SO CAN EVERYBODY ELSE.

393
00:11:54,645 --> 00:11:56,047
OKAY, I KNOW YOU CAN'T REALLY

394

00:11:56,848 --> 00:11:58,049
TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE WELL

396
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:01,052
IT'S DANGEROUS AND IT'S ILLEGAL

397
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:01,886
AND IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO YOU

398

KNOW RESULT IN THE LOSS OF LIFE

399

AND YOU KNOW WHAT LIVES ARE LIKE

400
00:12:04,188 --> 00:12:07,792
BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU DID WANT

401
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:10,328
TO TRY SAY THE BUMPER THING

402
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:11,762
JUST BE REAL CAREFUL THAT

403
00:12:11,762 --> 00:12:12,730
THE TAILGATER DOESN'T HAVE

404
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,631
THE FLASHING LIGHTS ON

405
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:15,266
THE TOP BECAUSE THOSE GUYS

406
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:16,367
HAVE NO SENSE OF HUMOUR.

407
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:17,134
THEY PULL YOU RIGHT OVER,

408
00:12:17,134 --> 00:12:18,002
TAKE YOUR LICENSE RIGHT ON THE

409
00:12:18,002 --> 00:12:19,070
SPOT AND THAT IS $125 FINE

410
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,806
AND YOU ONLY GET 14 DAYS TO PAY.

411
00:12:21,806 --> 00:12:22,873
OR I MEAN I WOULD IMAGINE IT

412
00:12:22,873 --> 00:12:26,444
WOULD BE SOMETHING IN THAT AREA.

413
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:27,678
ANYWAY UNTIL NEXT TIME,

414
00:12:27,678 --> 00:12:29,213
REMEMBER IF THE WOMEN DON'T

415
00:12:29,213 --> 00:12:30,181
FIND YOU HANDSOME,

416
00:12:30,181 --> 00:12:31,315
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST

417
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:32,917
FIND YOU HANDY.

418
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:36,754
I GOT TO GO BORROW SOME MONEY.

419

OH YOU KNOW, NOTHING.

596
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:46,663
ACTUALLY THE OLDEST SEX MYTH

597
00:17:46,663 --> 00:17:47,430
IS THAT THE MALE SEX IS

598
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,298
THE DOMINANT ONE OF

599
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:49,666
THE HUMAN SPECIES.

600
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:50,500
>>RED: HAROLD?

601
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,201

I WAS THE OLDEST SEX MYTH?

604
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,139
>>HAROLD: A LITTLE YEAH.

605
00:17:56,139 --> 00:17:58,375
ANYWAY, YOU KNOW IT'S NOT TRUE

606
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,276
THAT THE MALE HAS TO BE

607
00:17:59,276 --> 00:18:00,510
THE DOMINANT ONE IN ANY

608
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,845
RELATIONSHIP, NO, NO, NO, NO,

609
00:18:01,845 --> 00:18:02,979
BECAUSE SOME MEN ARE VERY

610
00:18:02,979 --> 00:18:03,980
SENSITIVE YOU KNOW AND SHY,

611
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,016
IN SUCH A CASE THEREFORE IT

612
00:18:06,016 --> 00:18:07,350
WOULD BE YOU KNOW PERFECTLY

613
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,085
ACCEPTABLE AND SENSIBLE AND

614
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:10,320
YOU KNOW MORE OFTEN THAN NOT

615
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,488
NECESSARY FOR THE FEMALE

616
00:18:11,488 --> 00:18:13,323
TO ASK HIM OUT,

617
00:18:13,323 --> 00:18:14,991
THAT WOULD BE A VERY 90'S

618
00:18:14,991 --> 00:18:15,792
UPFRONT THING FOR LADIES

619
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:17,861
TO DO, IT WOULD.

620
00:18:17,861 --> 00:18:21,064
>>RED: HAROLD, DON'T BEG.

621
00:18:21,064 --> 00:18:21,931

622
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:26,269

00:18:30,974 --> 00:18:31,741
>>RED: I KNOW A LOT OF YOU

624
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:32,475
TEENAGERS ARE ENJOYING YOUR

625
00:18:32,475 --> 00:18:33,910
DATING YEARS GOING OUT WITH

626
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:34,844
DIFFERENT BOYS AND GIRLS

627
00:18:34,844 --> 00:18:35,712
DEPENDING ON WHO YOU'RE IN

628
00:18:35,712 --> 00:18:37,180
LOVE WITH AT THAT MOMENT OR

629
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,148
WHO HAS A CAR OR WHO HAS

630
00:18:38,148 --> 00:18:40,550
MCDONALD'S COUPONS.

631
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,418
I KNOW IT'S FUN SOWING YOUR

632
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:43,319
WILD OATS OR WHEAT OR BRAN

633
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:45,522
OR WHATEVER YOUR ORIENTATION IS.

634
00:18:45,522 --> 00:18:46,356
BUT YOU KNOW EVENTUALLY THAT

635
00:18:46,356 --> 00:18:47,257
FUN IS GOING TO HAVE TO COME

636
00:18:47,257 --> 00:18:48,291
TO AN END, IT'LL BE TIME TO

637
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,127
GET MARRIED OR LEAVE TOWN.

638
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:52,896
I SUGGEST YOU GET MARRIED,

639
00:18:52,896 --> 00:18:53,696
NOT THAT MARRIAGE IS PERFECT

640
00:18:53,696 --> 00:18:54,697
BUT AT LEAST IT GIVES YOU ONE

641
00:18:54,697 --> 00:18:55,632
LESS THING TO WORRY ABOUT

642
00:18:55,632 --> 00:18:57,634
AS YOU LOSE YOUR LOOKS,

643
00:18:57,634 --> 00:18:58,701
SO MY POINT IS THAT WHILE

644
00:18:58,701 --> 00:18:59,636
YOU'RE DATING BE REALLY

645
00:18:59,636 --> 00:19:00,637
CAREFUL BECAUSE NOBODY'S GOING

646
00:19:00,637 --> 00:19:01,871
TO WANT TO MARRY YOU IF YOU'RE

647
00:19:01,871 --> 00:19:03,206
FLAT BROKE OR IN PRISON OR

648
00:19:03,206 --> 00:19:03,973
IF YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF

649
00:19:03,973 --> 00:19:06,309
UNIDENTIFIED RASH,

650
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:08,912

00:19:50,153 --> 00:19:51,387
IF YOU'RE NOT EVEN HERE?

681
00:19:51,387 --> 00:19:52,455
>>GLEN: WELL I DON'T NEED

682
00:19:52,455 --> 00:19:53,389

683
00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:54,791

684
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,025

THAT YOU'VE ALREADY MADE ENOUGH

689
00:20:01,097 --> 00:20:02,598
MONEY FOR THE WHOLE SEASON?

690
00:20:02,598 --> 00:20:04,400
>>GLEN: WELL NO NOT EXACTLY RED,

691
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,135
WHAT I'VE DONE IS I MADE ENOUGH

692
00:20:06,135 --> 00:20:07,437
TO BORROW AGAINST NEXT

693
00:20:07,437 --> 00:20:08,538
YEAR'S QUOTA, IT GIVES

694
00:20:08,538 --> 00:20:11,541
ME A BETTER TAX SITUATION.

695
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,775
>>RED: WELL I'M SORRY GLEN

696
00:20:12,775 --> 00:20:13,676
BUT I HAVE TO BUY A BOAT

697
00:20:13,676 --> 00:20:14,677
FOR OUR WATER PARK.

698
00:20:14,677 --> 00:20:15,878
>>GLEN: OH THAT'S A PROBLEM RED

699
00:20:15,878 --> 00:20:18,247
SEE BECAUSE I'VE ALREADY DONE

700
00:20:18,247 --> 00:20:20,616
MY BOOKS FOR THE WHOLE YEAR,

701
00:20:20,616 --> 00:20:21,851
SO IF I MAKE ANOTHER SALE THAT

702
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:23,386
THROWS OFF MY BALANCE SHEET

703
00:20:23,386 --> 00:20:24,620
REAL BAD, WHAT I COULD DO

704
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,922
THOUGH IS I COULD SELL YOU

705
00:20:25,922 --> 00:20:26,823
A BOAT NOW AND YOU COULD

706
00:20:26,823 --> 00:20:28,925
TAKE DELIVERY NEXT SUMMER.

707
00:20:28,925 --> 00:20:29,892
>>RED: NO, NO, NO, NO

708
00:20:29,892 --> 00:20:30,626
THAT WON'T WORK,

709
00:20:30,626 --> 00:20:32,261
MAYBE YOU COULD RENT ME A BOAT?

710
00:20:32,261 --> 00:20:34,097
>>GLEN: WELL I COULD DO THAT

711
00:20:34,097 --> 00:20:35,832
SURE EXCEPT THEY'RE ALL BROKEN.

712
00:20:35,832 --> 00:20:36,599
>>RED: WELL YOU'RE GOING TO

713
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:37,400
HAVE TO FIX ONE OF THEM GLEN.

714
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,203
>>GLEN: OH I CAN'T DO THAT RED,

715
00:20:40,203 --> 00:20:43,172
NO, NO, WHAT I COULD DO IS I

716
00:20:43,172 --> 00:20:43,940
COULD RENT YOU A BOAT AS IS

717
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,808
AND I COULD RENT YOU SOME TOOLS

718
00:20:45,808 --> 00:20:48,377
AND THEN YOU CAN HELP YOURSELF.

719
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:50,446
YOU SEE I'M GONE,

720
00:20:50,446 --> 00:20:51,514

BEING YOU KNOW ROLLED AROUND

744

INSIDE OF A CEMENT TRUCK

745
00:21:35,992 --> 00:21:36,893
AND THEN DUMPED OUT ONTO

746
00:21:36,893 --> 00:21:41,631
A CONCRETE TROUGH.

747
00:21:41,631 --> 00:21:42,298

IT MEANS THE RISK OF FOREST
