ONE OF THE KEY DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN

2
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,539
IS THEIR PERCEPTION
OF REALITY.

3
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:08,208
WOMEN LIKE REALITY.

4
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,743

BEING REAL IS EASY.

LOOKING REAL IS
A LOT MORE SPECIAL.

DO NOT STORE NEAR HEAT.

YOU THINK HE'D KNOW BETTER
THAN TRY TO PROP UP A
STOVE WITH THEM.

00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:49,509
YEAH, BUT JUNIOR IS NOT A
GREAT LOVER OF LITERATURE.

00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,517

PAINT WE PUT ON THE LEAVES
AROUND POSSUM LODGE,

88
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,752
THEY'RE ALL GOING TO FALL
OUT OF THE TREES ANYWAY

89
00:04:13,752 --> 00:04:16,055
'CAUSE THAT'S ALL PART OF
MOTHER NATURE'S PLAN,

90
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:17,890
AND WE KNOW HOW
IRRITATING SHE CAN BE.

SO I THOUGHT I WOULD TAKE
HANDYMAN CORNER HER

YOU CAN SAY GOOD-BYE TO THAT

94
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,668
ALL RIGHT, FIRST THING
WE'RE GOING TO NEED IS
A COUPLE OF TABLE --

95
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:33,105
WHERE THE HECK DID --
DARN LEAVES, MUST HAVE --

96
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:35,040

00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:50,556
ONE.

101
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:51,991
THERE WE GO.

102
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:54,059
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU NEED A
COUPLE OF THESE VINYL
TABLE CLOTHES,

103
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:56,762
WHICH YOU CAN PICK UP AT A
CHURCH PICNIC DURING
THE CLOSING PRAYERS

104
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:58,631
WHILE EVERYBODY
HAS THEIR EYES SHUT.

105
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,666
OKAY, AND YOU PUT
ONE DOWN ON THERE,

106
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,901
AND YOU PUT THE OTHER ONE,
LIE IT RIGHT DOWN
RIGHT ON TOP.

107
00:05:02,901 --> 00:05:05,170
THAT HAPPENS
A LOT OF PICNICS.

108
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,239
AND THEN YOU WANT TO SEAL UP
THREE OF THE SIDES.

109
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:09,141
YOU CAN USE A GLUE GUN FOR
THAT OR A SOLDERING IRON,

110
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:11,877
OR YOU COULD CRIMP
EAVESTROUGHING ALONG THERE.

111
00:05:11,877 --> 00:05:15,047
BUT I PREFER TO USE THE
HANDYMAN'S SECRET WEAPON,

112
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:16,782
DUCT TAPE.

113
00:05:16,782 --> 00:05:19,451
YOU WANT TO REALLY LAY THE
DUCT TAPE ON THERE

114
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:22,554
BECAUSE THIS COUCH IS GOING TO
HAVE TO WITHSTAND THOUSANDS
OF POUNDS OF PRESSURE,

115
00:05:22,554 --> 00:05:25,157
ESPECIALLY DURING
THE PLAYOFFS.

116
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:27,526
ALL RIGHT,
NOW ALL YOU GOT TO DO

117
00:05:27,526 --> 00:05:30,562
IS RAKE UP THE LEAVES OFF
YOUR FRONT LAWN AND
YOUR BACK LAWN

118
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:33,232
AND START STUFFING
THEM IN THERE.

119
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,100
NOW, IF YOU HAVE
A DOG OR SOMETHING,

120
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,469
YOU MAY WANT TO SIFT THROUGH
THE LEAVES TO AVOID
ANY SURPRISES.

121
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:40,806
OR I SUPPOSE YOU CAN
WEAR A PAIR OF GLOVES
OR SOMETHING.

122
00:05:43,742 --> 00:05:45,744
HOPE THAT
WAS A PINE CONE.

123
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:49,715
AND THERE WE ARE,
A COMFY LEAF COUCH.

124
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:52,818
A COUPLE LITTLE THROW
CUSHIONS FOR ACCENT PIECES.

125
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:56,188
AND HOW ABOUT A VERY
ATTRACTIVE LEAF FOOTSTOOL?

126
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:59,491
AND THE BEAUTY OF THIS IS
IN 5 MONTHS IT WILL BE SPRING

127
00:05:59,491 --> 00:06:02,194
AND ALL YOUR FURNITURE
WILL BE FULL OF COMPOST,

128
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:05,664
SO NOW YOU CAN START GROWING
REAL POTATOES INSTEAD OF
JUST COUCH ONES.

129
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:07,266
SO ENJOY YOUR
LIVING ROOM SET.

130
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,868
AND REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

131
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:11,904
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

132
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:14,006
ANOTHER BONUS IS WHEN YOU
WANT TO LIE ON THE COUCH,

133
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,441
YOU CAN BE A KID AGAIN
AND JUMP IN THE LEAVES.

AS BILL AND I HAVE A
GAME OF FULL CONTACT CROQUET,

135
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:25,284
AND RANGER GORD TELLS US
EVERYTHING HE KNOWS
ABOUT THE FOREST,

136
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:30,756
IT ONLY TAKES
A MINUTE.

137
00:06:30,756 --> 00:06:33,725
I WANT TO TALK TO
YOU MIDDLE-AGED GUYS
ABOUT JOB SECURITY.

138
00:06:33,725 --> 00:06:35,961
I'VE HAD A FEW JOBS MYSELF
OVER THE YEARS,

139
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:39,031
AND I KNOW THE PINK SLIP
WARNING SIGNS.

140
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,966
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL...

141
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:43,835
TAKE A DAY OFF WORK
AND NOBODY NOTICES.

142
00:06:43,835 --> 00:06:46,638
THAT'S A BAD SIGN, OKAY?

143
00:06:46,638 --> 00:06:49,174
OR YOUR BOSS KEEPS BRINGING
NEW EMPLOYEES INTO YOUR OFFICE

144
00:06:49,174 --> 00:06:54,379
AND SAYING,
"WHAT ABOUT HERE?"

145
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:56,815
OR YOU GO ON HOLIDAYS
FOR A WEEK

146
00:06:56,815 --> 00:07:00,585
AND THEY REPLACE YOU
WITH A 12-YEAR-OLD KID
WHO DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH.

147
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:02,821
AND THEN WHEN
YOU COME BACK

148
00:07:02,821 --> 00:07:04,856
THEY HAVE A GOING AWAY PARTY
FOR HIM AND EVERYBODY CRIES

149
00:07:04,856 --> 00:07:06,591
AND THE BOSS TAKES DOWN
HIS HOME PHONE NUMBER.

150
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:08,827
BAD SIGN.
BAD SIGN.

151
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:10,562
SO IF THIS SOUNDS
FAMILIAR TO YOU,

152
00:07:10,562 --> 00:07:13,465
LUCKILY, THERE ARE A
FEW THINGS YOU CAN DO
TO AVOID THE INEVITABLE.

153
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:17,936
FIRST ONE, GO OUT RIGHT NOW
AND MARRY SOMEBODY WHO
HAS A JOB.

154
00:07:17,936 --> 00:07:20,339
NEXT THING YOU CAN DO IS
GET ON A FIRST-NAME BASIS

155
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,808
WITH EVERYBODY DOWN AT
THE UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE.

156
00:07:22,808 --> 00:07:24,309
AND THE THIRD ONE,
MOST IMPORTANT,

157
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:26,011
DON'T GET
DOWN ON YOURSELF.

158
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:28,613
TRY TO LOOK AT THE BRIGHT
SIDE OF BEING UNEMPLOYED.

159
00:07:28,613 --> 00:07:31,116
FOR ONE THING,
YOUR TIME IS YOUR OWN, HUH?

160
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:32,784
NO TRAFFIC PROBLEMS.

161
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:36,121
YOU WAKE UP IN THE
MORNING, YOU'RE THERE!

162
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:38,390
I KNOW WHEN I WAS
OUT OF WORK

163
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:43,862
FROM EARLY JUNE 1982
TO LATE AUGUST... 1989,

164
00:07:43,862 --> 00:07:46,665
I NEVER GOT
DOWN ON MYSELF.

165
00:07:46,665 --> 00:07:49,134
I FIGURED, YOU KNOW, THERE'S
A LOT OF GUYS OUT THERE

166
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:51,803
MAKING A LOT OF MONEY DOING
SOMETHING THEY HATE: WORK.

167
00:07:51,803 --> 00:07:54,206
WHEREAS HERE
AM I MAKING ZIP

168
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:57,175
DOING SOMETHING
I LOVE: NOTHING.

169
00:07:57,175 --> 00:07:59,544
SO REMEMBER,
I'M PULLING FOR YOU

170
00:07:59,544 --> 00:08:02,013
BECAUSE WE'RE ALL
IN THIS TOGETHER.

171
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:07,552
WELL, THIS IDEA OF PAINTING
ALL THE LEAVES TO BRING
AUTUMN HERE EARLY

172
00:08:07,552 --> 00:08:09,721
HAS GONE OVER THE DAM
IN A BIG WAY.

173
00:08:09,721 --> 00:08:11,623
EVERYBODY IS
PRETTY DARNED EXCITED

174
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:13,458
ABOUT HAVING THE SEASONS
CHANGING THAT MUCH SOONER.

175
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,160
ESPECIALLY
MOOSE THOMPSON NOW

176
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,262
BECAUSE HIS BOSS TOLD HIM
HE COULD HAVE TWO WEEKS
OFF THIS FALL.

177
00:08:17,262 --> 00:08:20,799
NOW HE GETS TO TAKE THEM WHILE
HE'S STILL GOT THE GOOD
SUMMER WEATHER.

178
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:22,434
OLD MAN SEDGWICK,
HE LIKES THE IDEA

179
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:24,269
BECAUSE HE SAYS NOW HE CAN
BRING HIS DOCK IN

180
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:26,638
WHILE THE WATER
IS STILL WARM.

181
00:08:26,638 --> 00:08:29,007
YEAH, THE ONLY
REAL DOWN SIDE IS

182
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:31,943
NOW WE'RE HUNTING WHEN
THERE'S MOSQUITOES AND
BLACK FLIES OUT,

183
00:08:31,943 --> 00:08:34,946
SO WE'RE GOING TO DELAY THE
HUNTING SEASON CLOSER
TO CHRISTMAS,

184
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:36,948
WHICH IS GOING TO
BE IN OCTOBER,

185
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:38,350
AND EASTER WILL
FALL IN DECEMBER

186
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,884
AND THEN NEXT SUMMER
IS GOING TO START IN FEBRUARY,

187
00:08:39,884 --> 00:08:42,921
WHICH IS GOING TO SAVE
EVERYBODY A TON OF MONEY
IN AIR CONDITIONING.

188
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,692
UNCLE RED, I HOPE YOU'RE
TAKING YOUR TIME

189
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:49,961
AND CAREFULLY CHOOSING
THESE COLOURS, YOU KNOW.

190
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:54,199
I GET NERVOUS WHEN PEOPLE
IN PLAID START CHOOSING
COLOUR COORDINATES.

191
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:56,635
WELL, WE DON'T WANT TO
TAKE A LOT OF TIME
CHOOSING THEM,

192
00:08:56,635 --> 00:08:59,104
SO WE'RE NOT ASKING
THE WOMEN TO HELP.

193
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:01,306
Audience: OHHHHHHHH!

194
00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:03,141
NOW, WE WERE GOING TO GO
WITH THE GLOSSY,

195
00:09:03,141 --> 00:09:04,576
BUT THAT TAKES
TWO COATS,

196
00:09:04,576 --> 00:09:06,378
SO WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH
THE SATIN FINISH ON THAT.

197
00:09:06,378 --> 00:09:08,980
AND WITH THE SAPLINGS WE'RE
GOING TO GO WITH
THE MULBERRY,

198
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,016
AND THEN EVERY ALTERNATE
LEAF WILL HAVE KIND OF

199
00:09:11,016 --> 00:09:14,586
THE BEIGEY, BROWN, YELLOWY
KIND OF A PUTRID KIND
OF A LOOK HERE

200
00:09:14,586 --> 00:09:16,888
MIXED IN POSSIBLY WITH A
BURGUNDY AND A LIME GREEN.

201
00:09:16,888 --> 00:09:19,057
UNCLE RED, YOU THINK
THIS IDEA OF YOURS
IS GOING TO WORK?

202
00:09:19,057 --> 00:09:21,526
DON'T YOU THINK THAT
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO KNOW
THE TREES ARE JUST PAINTED?

203
00:09:21,526 --> 00:09:24,963
YOU EVER SEEN THE PEOPLE THAT
COME UP AND LOOK AT THE
FALL COLOURS?

204
00:09:24,963 --> 00:09:26,965
THESE ARE
SENIOR CITIZENS.

205
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:29,334
THE AVERAGE AGE IS
DECEASED, HAROLD.

206
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:31,336
THEY'RE ABOUT FOUR FEET TALL,
THEY'RE SITTING THERE
IN THE BUS,

207
00:09:31,336 --> 00:09:33,304
THEY CAN HARDLY SEE OVER
THE EDGE OF THE WINDOW THERE,

208
00:09:33,304 --> 00:09:35,073
THEY GOT THE
BIFOCALS HAPPENING,

209
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:38,176
TINTED GLASS WINDOWS AND THE
FOREST IS GOING BY AT
100 KLICKS AN HOUR.

210
00:09:38,176 --> 00:09:40,111
UNCLE RED, I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD TALK LIKE THAT,

211
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:42,814
YOUR FATHER WILL PROBABLY
BE A PASSENGER IN ONE
OF THOSE BUSES.

212
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:46,251
NO WAY.
HE'LL BE DRIVING.

213
00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:48,520
Red: WE'RE UP HERE AT
FIRE TOWER 13 WITH RANGER GORD,

214
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,588
A MAN WHO HAS SPENT THE LAST
16 YEARS, DAY AND NIGHT,

215
00:09:50,588 --> 00:09:52,090
UP IN THAT TOWER NOT ABLE
TO HAVE A WIFE,

216
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,558
NOT ABLE TO HAVE
A FAMILY.

217
00:09:53,558 --> 00:09:56,127
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
IN A WAY HE IS WEDDED
TO THE FOREST.

218
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:57,562
THAT'S TRUE, RED.

219
00:09:57,562 --> 00:09:59,264
IN FACT WE MADE IT
OFFICIAL LAST WEEK.

220
00:09:59,264 --> 00:10:00,865
HAD A LITTLE CEREMONY
AND EVERYTHING.

221
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:02,934
HOW DO YOU MEAN,
GORD?

222
00:10:02,934 --> 00:10:05,069
I GOT MARRIED
TO THE FOREST.

223
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:06,905
MADE IT OFFICIAL.

224
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:09,440
I MEAN, AFTER 16 YEARS
OF NOT BEING MARRIED,

225
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,609
YOU KNOW,
IT WASN'T FAIR.

226
00:10:11,609 --> 00:10:14,612
YEAH, I ORDERED
A RING AND EVERYTHING.

227
00:10:14,612 --> 00:10:17,182
COST ME TWO
MONTHS' SALARY.

228
00:10:17,182 --> 00:10:19,250
I THINK HE MEANS
TWO MONTHS' SANITY.

229
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,952
ANYWAY, WE'RE ALL PAINTING
LEAVES, AS YOU KNOW,

230
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:23,621
SO I THOUGHT I'D GET
RANGER GORD TO TEACH US
ALL ABOUT LEAVES THIS WEEK.

231
00:10:23,621 --> 00:10:25,456
I MEAN, I WANTED TO TALK
ABOUT HOW BEARS MATE,

232
00:10:25,456 --> 00:10:27,458
BUT APPARENTLY
RED DIDN'T THINK THAT
WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA.

233
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,760
NO, IT'S NOT A
GOOD IDEA.

234
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,128
WE'RE GOING TO TALK
ABOUT LEAVES, GORD.

235
00:10:30,128 --> 00:10:32,063
I'M NOT SURE WHAT I'M
GOING TO DO WITH ALL
THE BEAR COSTUMES.

236
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,531
WE'RE GOING TO TALK
ABOUT THE LEAVES, GORD.

237
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:35,266
ALL RIGHT, SO HERE
ARE SOME LEAVES.

238
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:36,868
HERE IS AN OAK LEAF.
YEAH.

239
00:10:36,868 --> 00:10:38,603
A MAPLE LEAF AND,
OF COURSE,

240
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:40,138
A BIRCH LEAF.

241
00:10:40,138 --> 00:10:41,706
WHAT SORT OF DIFFERENCES
DO YOU NOTICE,

242
00:10:41,706 --> 00:10:45,009
MR. NO-BEAR-MATING
GREEN?

243
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:47,045
WELL, THE OAK LEAF IS
CERTAINLY ROUNDER,

244
00:10:47,045 --> 00:10:49,347
AND THE MAPLE LEAF HAS
GOT ALL THE POINTS
GOING THERE

245
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:52,717
AND THEN THE BIRCH
IS SMALLER WITH THE
SERRATED EDGE ON IT.

246
00:10:52,717 --> 00:10:54,352
SURE.
YEAH.

247
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:56,454
WHAT ELSE?

248
00:10:56,454 --> 00:11:00,224
WHAT ABOUT
THEIR MOODS?
THEIR MOODS?

249
00:11:00,224 --> 00:11:02,293
YEAH.

250
00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:05,296
SEE, THE OAK LEAF
IS HAPPY,

251
00:11:05,296 --> 00:11:07,498
HAPPY AND CONTENTED,
SEE?

252
00:11:07,498 --> 00:11:09,467
AND THE MAPLE LEAF
IS ANGRY,

253
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:12,403
UPSET ABOUT SOMETHING.
[ GROWLS ]

254
00:11:12,403 --> 00:11:14,172
AND THE BIRCH LEAF
IS TENSE,

255
00:11:14,172 --> 00:11:16,374
HOLDING IT ALL IN.

256
00:11:16,374 --> 00:11:18,443
YEAH.

257
00:11:18,443 --> 00:11:21,412
BUT I MARRIED HER FOR
BETTER OR WORSE.

258
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:23,614
ALL RIGHT, GORD, WELL,
YOU KNOW, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

259
00:11:23,614 --> 00:11:24,849
I APPRECIATE IT.

260
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:26,350
BUT THE GUYS ARE PAINTING,

261
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,952
AND I REALLY SHOULD GO
HELP THEM, YOU KNOW.
OKAY.

262
00:11:27,952 --> 00:11:29,420
AND MAKE SURE YOU USE
A LATEX PAINT

263
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,622
BECAUSE SOME OF THE OIL
BASED PAINTS HAVE FUMES

264
00:11:31,622 --> 00:11:33,291
THAT COULD DAMAGE
THE BRAIN.

265
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,359
NO KIDDING.

266
00:11:36,394 --> 00:11:38,229
IT'S MAIL CALL.

267
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:46,537
OKAY, BOB FROM
CALEDONIA WRITES...

268
00:11:46,537 --> 00:11:48,272
"HOW CAN YOU FIGURE
OUT WHETHER A WOMAN

269
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:51,742
"FINDS YOU HANDSOME
OR JUST HANDY?"

270
00:11:51,742 --> 00:11:53,311
THAT'S A
GOOD QUESTION

271
00:11:53,311 --> 00:11:55,446
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING WORSE
THAN THINKING SHE SAID,

272
00:11:55,446 --> 00:11:57,315
YOU KNOW, COME ON UP
FOR A NICE LIGHT DINNER

273
00:11:57,315 --> 00:12:01,819
WHEN SHE ACTUALLY SAID
WAS COME ON UP AND FIX
MY LIGHT DIMMER.

274
00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:04,522
WHOLE FAMILY STANDS AROUND

275
00:12:04,522 --> 00:12:07,325
AND WATCHES YOU ALMOST
ELECTROCUTE YOURSELF.

276
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,495
WELL, THAT WOULD EXPLAIN
A FEW THINGS, HAROLD.

277
00:12:11,495 --> 00:12:14,632
BOB, I WOULD SAY THAT
IT'S THIS WAY...

278
00:12:14,632 --> 00:12:16,133
IF A WOMAN INVITES YOU UP
FOR A NIGHT CAP,

279
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:18,035
THAT MEANS SHE
FINDS YOU HANDSOME;

280
00:12:18,035 --> 00:12:20,471
WHEREAS, IF SHE INVITES YOU UP
TO BAIT HER MOUSE TRAPS,

281
00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:22,340
WELL, SHE FINDS YOU HANDY.

282
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,309
IF SHE INVITES YOU UP TO
SHOW YOU HER YOUR NEW BEDROOM,

283
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:26,777
YOU'RE HANDSOME;

284
00:12:26,777 --> 00:12:30,014
WHEREAS, IF SHE INVITES YOU UP
FOR AN ESTIMATE TO FIX
HER NEW BATHROOM,

285
00:12:30,014 --> 00:12:31,983
WELL, YOU'D BE HANDY.

286
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:33,985
IF SHE SAYS COFFEE,
TEA OR ME,

287
00:12:33,985 --> 00:12:36,020
SHE FINDS YOU HANDSOME.

288
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,824
IF SHE SAYS LATEX,
OIL OR SEMI-GLOSS,

289
00:12:39,824 --> 00:12:41,826
YOU'RE HANDY.

290
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:44,362
BUT IF YOU CAN FIND A WOMAN
WHO SAYS "I DO,"

291
00:12:44,362 --> 00:12:46,130
YOU'RE IN LUCK,

292
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,432
BECAUSE THAT MEANS SHE
FINDS YOU HANDSOME
 ANDHANDY.

293
00:12:48,432 --> 00:12:53,838
THAT'S FOR SURE.
I DO!

294
00:12:53,838 --> 00:12:56,907
THAT'S THE ONE
RIGHT THERE, I DO.

295
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:03,514
I DO WHAT?

296
00:13:03,514 --> 00:13:05,616
YOU DON'T, HAROLD.

297
00:13:05,616 --> 00:13:08,386
NOT YET.
NOT EVER.

298
00:13:10,154 --> 00:13:13,057
Red: WELL, BILL HAD CALLED ME
OUT TO THE FIELD OUT BEHIND
THE LODGE THERE

299
00:13:13,057 --> 00:13:15,326
BECAUSE HE HAD SET UP
A CROQUET SET

300
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:18,462
AND APPARENTLY HE HAD
SET UP QUITE AN UNUSUAL --

301
00:13:18,462 --> 00:13:20,898
I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING THAT
MANY STICKS ON THEM BEFORE.

302
00:13:20,898 --> 00:13:23,033
ANYWAY, I TOOK A SHOT.
I ALWAYS LOVE CROQUET.

303
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:24,535
YEAH, THERE YOU GO.
PERFECT.

304
00:13:24,535 --> 00:13:25,936
THAT'S THE WAY YOU
DO IT, BILL, YEAH.

305
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:29,039
YOU KNOW I THINK CROQUET
I THINK OF IT AS KIND
OF AN ENGLISH

306
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,775
THE ROYAL FAMILY THING.

307
00:13:30,775 --> 00:13:34,078
ALTHOUGH I GUESS "CROQUET" IS
KIND OF A FRENCH WORD AND A --

308
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:35,746
A LITTLE BAWDY ENGLISH
FROM BILL THERE.

309
00:13:35,746 --> 00:13:38,415
YOU GOT TO HIT THE BALL AS
PART OF THE GAME THERE, BILL.

310
00:13:38,415 --> 00:13:40,117
OH. OH. OH. OH.

311
00:13:40,117 --> 00:13:42,453
NO. NO. NO. NO. NO.

312
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:44,188
NO, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE GOING THROUGH --

313
00:13:44,188 --> 00:13:45,723
YOU GOT TO GO THROUGH
THE HOOPS IN A CERTAIN --

314
00:13:45,723 --> 00:13:48,425
BUT I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY A
GAME THAT PROBABLY DATES BACK

315
00:13:48,425 --> 00:13:49,693
TO THE TIME WHEN --

316
00:13:49,693 --> 00:13:50,961
NO. NO --

317
00:13:50,961 --> 00:13:53,931
DATES BACK TO THE TIME -- NO.

318
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:55,799
LATER THAT WEEK...

319
00:13:57,301 --> 00:14:00,638
PROBABLY DATES BACK TO THE
TIME WHEN I GUESS PEOPLE
HAD A LOT MORE TIME.

320
00:14:00,638 --> 00:14:03,774
BILL, THIS IS NOT --
NOW, EASY, EASY.

321
00:14:03,774 --> 00:14:05,876
OH. OH.

322
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:08,546
I THINK THAT'S
A DIFFERENT GAME.

323
00:14:08,546 --> 00:14:11,916
WHAT'S THAT?
OH, IT'S ONE OF THOSE
RADIO CONTROLLED --

324
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,417
RADIO CONTROLLED CAR.

325
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,286
THAT'S HAROLD'S RADIO
CONTROLLED CAR THERE.

326
00:14:15,286 --> 00:14:16,921
WHAT'S GOING ON?

327
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:18,422
HE'S DRILLING A HOLE.

328
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:19,890
IS HE TRYING TO
LIGHTEN THE BALL?

329
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:23,193
HE TOOK THE RADIO CONTROL
UNIT OUT OF THE -- WHAT?

330
00:14:23,193 --> 00:14:25,262
OH THAT'S FROM THE
UNPLUGGED ALBUM.

331
00:14:25,262 --> 00:14:27,064
OH... OH, I SEE.

332
00:14:27,064 --> 00:14:30,034
WE GOT A RADIO CONTROLLED
CROQUET BALL.

333
00:14:30,034 --> 00:14:31,835
LOOK AT THAT THING.
LOOK AT THAT.
LOOK AT THAT.

334
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:34,738
OH LOOK AT HIM RACK UP
THE POINTS.

335
00:14:34,738 --> 00:14:38,809
I'M THINKING TO MYSELF,
HEY, YOU GOT A RADIO
CONTROLLED CAR,

336
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:41,712
WHY CAN'T I HAVE A RADIO
CONTROLLED PLANE?

337
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:44,448
HEH-HEH-HEH

338
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:46,417
BOY, I LOVE A CHALLENGE.

339
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:50,254
WATCH THIS, BILL.
HOW ABOUT THAT, HUH?

340
00:14:50,254 --> 00:14:52,990
STAR TREK.

341
00:14:55,592 --> 00:14:58,162
I GOT MINE DRIFTING THROUGH,
FLOATING IN,

342
00:14:58,162 --> 00:15:00,264
TOUCHING THE POST...
BOINK, THERE WE GO!

343
00:15:00,264 --> 00:15:03,434
ON TO THE NEXT HOOP.
OH FANTASTIC.

344
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:05,169
THERE GOES BILL.
I'M RIGHT BEHIND HIM.
I'M RIGHT BEHIND HIM.

345
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:07,371
I'M GOING TO WIN.
I'M GOING TO WIN.

346
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:09,106
YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. YEAH!

347
00:15:09,106 --> 00:15:12,509
GET OUT. GET OUT. GET OUT.
GET OUT. GET OUT.

348
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:13,510
OUT OF MY HOUSE.

349
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,012
OH.

350
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:17,047
OH MAN.

351
00:15:17,047 --> 00:15:19,183
NOW, REMEMBER THIS, KIDS,

352
00:15:19,183 --> 00:15:21,852
DON'T BE A SORE WINNER.

353
00:15:21,852 --> 00:15:24,288
IT CAN CAUSE
YOU PROBLEMS.

354
00:15:27,391 --> 00:15:29,193
SEE WHAT I MEAN?

355
00:15:29,193 --> 00:15:32,129
DO YOUR BRAGGING WHEN
NO ONE CAN SEE YOU.

356
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:33,497
Red: STAY TUNED.

357
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:35,532
BUZZ SHERWOOD HAS A
WHOLE NEW PERSONALITY,

358
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:37,634
AND HAROLD AND I HAVE
A WHOLE NEW WARDROBE.

359
00:15:40,838 --> 00:15:43,540
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU, SIR,
WE HAVE NEW RESPECT FOR
MOTHER NATURE

360
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,642
AND HOW SHE CAN WHIP UP
THOSE COLOURS IN THE FOREST,

361
00:15:45,642 --> 00:15:47,811
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

362
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:49,713
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK
IS HOLDING US UP?

363
00:15:49,713 --> 00:15:51,381
TAKING THE TIME TO TAKE
THOSE NEWSPAPERS

364
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:53,450
AND WRAP THEM AROUND
THE TRUNKS OF THE TREES.

365
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,220
NO, HAROLD, IT'S WRESTLING
THE DARN SCAFFOLDING
THROUGH THE FOREST.

366
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,322
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE EITHER
SHORING UP ONE END
OR THE OTHER.

367
00:15:58,322 --> 00:16:00,257
I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE,

368
00:16:00,257 --> 00:16:03,327
PUTTING A PRIMER COAT ON
THOSE BIRCH TREES IS A
WASTE OF TIME.

369
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,429
OH, HEY, HEY, UNCLE RED,
HERE'S AN IDEA.

370
00:16:05,429 --> 00:16:08,799
HOW ABOUT GETTING BUZZ TO
DROP A BUNCH OF PAILS OF
PAINT FROM HIS PLANE?

371
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,634
OH, YEAH, HE CAN COVER
MORE ACRES IN A
COUPLE FLYBYS

372
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:13,136
THAN YOU CAN IN A WEEK.

373
00:16:15,872 --> 00:16:17,507
HAROLD, YOU SHOULD
CIRCLE THIS DATE,

374
00:16:17,507 --> 00:16:18,875
YOU'RE GOING TO
WANT TO REMEMBER IT.

375
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,210
WHY?

376
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,878
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW AND
UNTIL WE TRY THIS IDEA,

377
00:16:21,878 --> 00:16:23,814
YOU ARE A GENIUS.

378
00:16:25,882 --> 00:16:28,685
UP IN THE NORTH MANY PEOPLE
HAVE COME TO RELY ON
THE BUSH PILOT.

379
00:16:28,685 --> 00:16:32,122
IN OUR AREA MANY PEOPLE
HAVE COME TO BLAME THE
BUSH PILOT.

380
00:16:32,122 --> 00:16:34,291
THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S
BUZZ SHERWOOD.

381
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,660
HEY, BUZZ!
BUZZ?

382
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,962
RED GREEN,
MY GOOD FRIEND.

383
00:16:38,962 --> 00:16:40,797
HOW ARE YOU??
DON'T HURT ME.
DON'T HURT ME.

384
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:42,632
I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

385
00:16:42,632 --> 00:16:45,635
AND, HAROLD, HOW ARE MY
FELLOW TRAVELLERS TODAY?

386
00:16:45,635 --> 00:16:47,371
WELL, WE'RE FINE.

387
00:16:47,371 --> 00:16:49,206
GOOD. GOOD. GOOD.

388
00:16:49,206 --> 00:16:50,941
WHAT YOU ARE YOUR
DOING HERE, BUZZ?

389
00:16:50,941 --> 00:16:52,943
WELL, I'M ASSESSING THE
CONDITION OF MY AIRCRAFT

390
00:16:52,943 --> 00:16:54,878
AND ITS MAINTENANCE LEVEL

391
00:16:54,878 --> 00:16:57,414
AND I FEAR IT IS
UNFLIGHTWORTHY AND
DANGEROUS.

392
00:16:57,414 --> 00:16:58,915
ARE YOU FEELING OKAY?

393
00:16:58,915 --> 00:17:01,618
RED, I'VE NEVER
FELT BETTER.

394
00:17:01,618 --> 00:17:04,955
I'VE MET A WOMAN.
OH, MAN!

395
00:17:04,955 --> 00:17:06,790
SHE BELONGS TO A VERY
SPECIAL CHURCH.

396
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,458
WE TALKED --

397
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,227
WELL, WE DIDN'T
TALK SO MUCH

398
00:17:10,227 --> 00:17:11,995
AS WE SHARED
AN EXPERIENCE.

399
00:17:11,995 --> 00:17:14,331
AND I HAVE DECIDED TO
EMBRACE THEIR WAYS,

400
00:17:14,331 --> 00:17:16,566
AND I'M SO GLAD I DID.

401
00:17:16,566 --> 00:17:19,302
SHE'S TAUGHT ME HOW TO
TAME THE BEAST WITHIN.

402
00:17:19,302 --> 00:17:21,972
WELL, SHE'S NOT
HERE RIGHT NOW

403
00:17:21,972 --> 00:17:24,641
SO MAYBE YOU CAN LET
THE BEAST OUT THE
ONE MORE TIME.

404
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:26,243
I NEED A BIT OF
A FAVOUR.

405
00:17:26,243 --> 00:17:27,811
CAN YOU FLY
FOR ME BUZZ?

406
00:17:27,811 --> 00:17:29,479
AH, NO MORE
FLYING, RED.

407
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:31,248
ONLY MY SPIRIT
FLIES NOW.

408
00:17:31,248 --> 00:17:33,750
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED
IN BUYING SOME OF MY
POSSESSIONS?

409
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,353
ALL MONIES RAISED GO
TO THE GREATER ONENESS.

410
00:17:36,353 --> 00:17:38,355
WELL, I DON'T THINK
YOUR CLOTHES WOULD
FIT ME,

411
00:17:38,355 --> 00:17:40,223
I'M KIND OF A
GREATER ONENESS MYSELF.

412
00:17:40,223 --> 00:17:42,092
MY ALBUMS, YOU'D ENJOY
SOME OF MY ALBUMS.

413
00:17:42,092 --> 00:17:43,860
NO, THEY WOULDN'T
FIT ME EITHER.

414
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,896
NEVER BEEN A BEEN A
BIG MOBY GRAPE FAN.

415
00:17:45,896 --> 00:17:48,798
AH, MOBY GRAPE,
THE OLD BUZZ.
YEAH.

416
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:51,001
NOW THE NEW
BUZZ HAS FOCUS.

417
00:17:51,001 --> 00:17:55,272
EXCUSE ME, I HAVE TO CLOSE
THE CIRCLE WITHIN NOW

418
00:17:55,272 --> 00:17:58,008
AND BECOME AS
ONE WITH IT.

419
00:18:00,277 --> 00:18:02,412
WELL, IT'S TOO BAD,
BUZZ, YOU KNOW.

420
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:04,481
I MEAN, I CERTAINLY
RESPECT YOUR DECISION,

421
00:18:04,481 --> 00:18:07,751
BUT, YOU KNOW,
WHAT I WAS PLANNING
ON GETTING YOU TO DO

422
00:18:07,751 --> 00:18:11,454
IS TO GET UP IN THE
PLANE THERE AND TAKE
SOME BUCKETS OF PAINT

423
00:18:11,454 --> 00:18:13,523
AND OPEN THE DOORS -- WELL,
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY,

424
00:18:13,523 --> 00:18:15,992
AND JUST TAKE THE LIDS
OFF AND THROW THE
PAINT OUT THERE

425
00:18:15,992 --> 00:18:18,695
AND THEY'D CATCH IN THE
WIND AND FALL DOWN

426
00:18:18,695 --> 00:18:21,865
AND PAINT ALL THE LEAVES
ON ALL THE TREES IN THE
FOREST, YOU KNOW.

427
00:18:21,865 --> 00:18:24,934
AND THE COLOURS THAT
WE PICKED THE OLD BUZZ
WOULD HAVE LIKED.

428
00:18:24,934 --> 00:18:27,671
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
PURPLE AND YELLOW

429
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:32,308
AND KIND OF AN ORANGEY,
RUSTY, MAGENTA THING.

430
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:33,910
PSYCHEDELIC?!
YEAH.

431
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,445
FAR OUT. GREAT!

432
00:18:35,445 --> 00:18:37,180
I'M FREAKY.
I'M IN. I'M IN.

433
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,648
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A GREAT IDEA.

434
00:18:38,648 --> 00:18:40,283
THAT ONENESS THING
WE'LL LEAVE TILL LATER?

435
00:18:40,283 --> 00:18:42,986
OH, THIS, YEAH, SURE.
WE CAN DO THIS
ANOTHER DAY.

436
00:18:42,986 --> 00:18:44,821
THIS PAINTING THE
FOREST SOUNDS WAY BETTER.

437
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:46,523
GREAT, YEAH, GREAT.
I'M IN.

438
00:18:46,523 --> 00:18:47,924
WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT.

439
00:18:47,924 --> 00:18:49,626
DIDN'T YOU SAY THE
PLANE WAS UNSAFE?

440
00:18:49,626 --> 00:18:53,163
OH YEAH, BUT IT'S OKAY
BECAUSE I'M AT ONE
WITH IT.

441
00:18:53,163 --> 00:18:54,431
WELL, I'M NOT.

442
00:18:55,832 --> 00:18:58,168
WE'RE BACK HERE
AGAIN AT OUR DREAM HOME
RENOVATION PROJECT,

443
00:18:58,168 --> 00:19:01,671
AND UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE
RUN INTO ONE OF THE SNAGS

444
00:19:01,671 --> 00:19:03,840
THAT A LOT OF
RENOVATIONS RUN INTO.

445
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,842
I'M REALLY SORRY,
MR. GREEN.

446
00:19:05,842 --> 00:19:08,311
I'M REALLY,
REALLY SORRY.
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

447
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:10,013
A LOT OF YOU
REMEMBER MIKE.

448
00:19:10,013 --> 00:19:11,681
MIKE OF COURSE,
IT'S NO SECRET,

449
00:19:11,681 --> 00:19:13,283
ESPECIALLY IN THIS
NEIGHBOURHOOD,

450
00:19:13,283 --> 00:19:15,185
MIKE IS A CONVICTED
FELON OUT ON PAROLE.

451
00:19:15,185 --> 00:19:16,519
DID I GET THAT
RIGHT, MIKE?

452
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:18,521
THAT'S RIGHT,
MR. GREEN.
YEAH.

453
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:20,824
AND, MIKE, NOW THAT YOU'RE
OUT AND UNSUPERVISED,

454
00:19:20,824 --> 00:19:22,959
TELL THE PEOPLE AT
HOME WHAT IS THE
ONE THING

455
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:25,195
THAT KEEPS YOU ON THE
STRAIGHT AND NARROW.

456
00:19:25,195 --> 00:19:27,530
OH, URINALYSIS.

457
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,566
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.
AS I SAY -- ALL RIGHT.

458
00:19:29,566 --> 00:19:31,167
AS I SAY, WE GOT
INTO A BIT OF A
PROBLEM HERE.

459
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:32,669
MIKE WENT A
LITTLE OVERBOARD

460
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:35,471
AND HE WENT OUT AND
BOUGHT WAY TOO MUCH
OF THE PANELING

461
00:19:35,471 --> 00:19:38,107
AND THE 2X4s FOR OUR
REC ROOM RENOVATION.

462
00:19:38,107 --> 00:19:41,744
WAY, WAY,
WAY TOO MUCH.

463
00:19:41,744 --> 00:19:43,580
I'M REALLY SORRY,
MR. GREEN.

464
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,648
WELL, IT'S ALWAYS A
GOOD THING TO HAVE
A LITTLE EXTRA,

465
00:19:45,648 --> 00:19:48,217
BECAUSE YOU GOT TO
ALLOW FOR BREAKAGE
AND MISTAKES

466
00:19:48,217 --> 00:19:49,986
AND THE OCCASIONAL
HOUSE FIRE.

467
00:19:49,986 --> 00:19:51,988
NOW, RATHER THAN TAKE
THESE 2X4s AND BURN THEM

468
00:19:51,988 --> 00:19:54,157
IN A BARREL OVER ON
A PICKET LINE SOMEWHERE

469
00:19:54,157 --> 00:19:56,259
OR TO TAKE THE
PANELING AND SHRED HER
DOWN THROUGH A GARBURATOR,

470
00:19:56,259 --> 00:19:59,562
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M
GOING TO TAKE THESE 2X4s
AND THIS EXTRA PANELING

471
00:19:59,562 --> 00:20:01,464
AND SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE
SOMETHING A LOT NICER

472
00:20:01,464 --> 00:20:02,966
THAN THAT
CRAPPY REC ROOM.

473
00:20:02,966 --> 00:20:04,901
I'M REALLY SO SORRY,
MR. GREEN.

474
00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:08,371
I'M SORRY, MR. GREEN.

475
00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:09,939
YEAH,
OKAY, MIKE.

476
00:20:09,939 --> 00:20:12,442
WELL, A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY
THEY LIKE TO HAVE THE CEDAR
SHAKES ON THEIR HOUSE,

477
00:20:12,442 --> 00:20:14,510
BUT THEY'RE JUST NOT
PREPARED TO GO THE
BIG DOLLAR.

478
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,280
WELL, I BET EVERYBODY HAS
ENOUGH MONEY FOR PANEL
SHAKES.

479
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,815
REAL NICE, MR. GREEN.

480
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,616
AND CORRECT ME
IF I'M WRONG

481
00:20:20,616 --> 00:20:24,520
BUT TO ME NOTHING SAYS
MONEY AND TASTE LIKE
AN AWNING.

482
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,689
MAGNIFICENT.

483
00:20:26,689 --> 00:20:30,226
NOW, IF YOU HAVE A DREAM
HOME THAT HAPPENS TO HAVE
A FIREPLACE IN IT,

484
00:20:30,226 --> 00:20:32,395
FOR SURE,
FOR DARN SURE,

485
00:20:32,395 --> 00:20:34,597
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT
TO HAVE ONE OF THESE
BABIES RIGHT HERE.

486
00:20:34,597 --> 00:20:36,332
WELL, I DON'T HAVE A
HOUSE OR EVEN A FIREPLACE,

487
00:20:36,332 --> 00:20:38,167
BUT I WANT ONE
OF THESE ALREADY.

488
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:39,602
WHAT IS IT??

489
00:20:39,602 --> 00:20:41,370
WELL, MIKE, THIS IS A
CHUTE FOR FIREWOOD.

490
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,573
KIND OF A TIME SAVING
SHORTCUT DEVICE

491
00:20:43,573 --> 00:20:46,042
THAT ALLOWS YOU TO PUT
THE WOOD RIGHT DOWN
INTO THE BASEMENT.

492
00:20:46,042 --> 00:20:48,377
WHAT, LIKE THIS?

493
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:51,114
WELL, YOU OF COURSE WANT
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE
WINDOW IS OPEN

BEFORE YOU DID
THAT, YOU KNOW.

495
00:20:52,949 --> 00:20:54,650
SO SORRY
ABOUT THAT, SIR.

496
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:58,554
WELL, THERE YOU
HAVE IT, HUH?

497
00:20:58,554 --> 00:21:01,757

WE TURNED IT
UPSIDE DOWN,

WE'RE SITTING PRETTY.

YEAH, WISH THEY'D TAUGHT
ME SOMETHING LIKE THIS
IN PRISON.

501
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:11,667
OH, SURE, MIKE.

502
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:13,870
I GUESS THIS MUST BE A
BIT OF A LIFE LESSON
FOR YOU, HUH?

503
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,772
YOU MADE A BIG MISTAKE,
BUT WE WORKED IT OUT

504
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:20,009
AND NOBODY HAD TO
GO BACK TO PRISON.

505
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:24,413
GUESS NOW WOULD BE A GOOD
TIME TO TELL YOU ABOUT
THE 10 EXTRA BATHTUBS.

506
00:21:28,384 --> 00:21:30,453
I'LL TELL YOU, THERE IS
NOTHING MORE FRUSTRATING

507
00:21:30,453 --> 00:21:32,688
THAN TO SEE A GOOD IDEA
GO RIGHT DOWN THE DRAIN.

508

HE FLEW OVER IN THE
PLANE THERE,

510
00:21:37,593 --> 00:21:39,462
DROPPED A GREAT BIG HUNK
OF BLUE PAINT

511
00:21:39,462 --> 00:21:41,197
THAT COME DOWN AND MIXED
WITH THE PURPLE HE HAD
ALREADY DROPPED

512
00:21:41,197 --> 00:21:42,865
AND THAT KIND OF BLENDED
IN WITH THE DUSTY SALMON.

513
00:21:42,865 --> 00:21:44,667
BY THE TIME HE WAS DONE,

514
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:47,036
THE WHOLE AREA AROUND POSSUM
LAKE LOOKED UNBELIEVABLE,

515
00:21:47,036 --> 00:21:50,673
LIKE ONE OF THEM CARNIVALS
FROM RIO "DI JANUARY."

516
00:21:50,673 --> 00:21:52,408
YOU KNOW, BUT WE SHOULD
MENTION AT THIS TIME

517
00:21:52,408 --> 00:21:54,243
THAT WE USED
A WATER BASED PAINT,

518
00:21:54,243 --> 00:21:56,145
THAT WAY NONE OF THE
WILDLIFE WOULD GET HURT.

519
00:21:56,145 --> 00:21:58,414
YEAH, RIGHT,
WATER BASED PAINT,
ISN'T THAT GREAT STUFF?

520
00:21:58,414 --> 00:22:00,416
UNTIL IT RAINS!

WELL, I THINK YOU WERE
ASKING FOR IT.

STORM WAS SO BIG, YOU KNOW.

PLAYING TRICKS ON

REALLY, HAROLD?
I THINK YOUR PARENTS DID.

525
00:22:12,028 --> 00:22:15,097
SO OUR WHOLE KALEIDOSCOPE
OF PAINT WASHED OFF
ALL THE LEAVES,

526
00:22:15,097 --> 00:22:17,800
DOWN INTO THE RIVERS
AND ALL ENDED UP DOWN
IN POSSUM LAKE.

527
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,202
SO NOW THE FOREST IS
BACK GREEN AS USUAL

ALL YOU GUYS OUT THERE,
