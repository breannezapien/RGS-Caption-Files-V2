1
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:11,511
It's a new red green show.

2
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,115
And now here's the man who brings the
outdoors indoors to your door.

3
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:18,284
The man you adore coming
through that door, Mr.

4
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,819
Red Green.

5
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,964
Thank you. Appreciate it very much.

6
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:34,434
Well, this morning I was walking around
downtown, downtown.

7
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:38,037
We're downtown. We have we hardly have a
town, let alone a downtown where its downtown

8
00:00:38,404 --> 00:00:38,771
is that.

9
00:00:41,407 --> 00:00:45,044
Where the Roads Cross Herald, OK, we got a
building on each corner around here, that's

10
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:46,079
an urban core.

11
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,716
So anyway, I'm walking around downtown, got
the shock of my life.

12
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,452
Oh yeah, I meant to tell you. Murray
installed a full length mirror in front of

13
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:52,919
his store.

14
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,493
I'm talking about what was in the store,
Harold had a satellite dish in there for the

15
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:03,863
TV and I'm thinking to myself, Boy, you
know, if we had one of those up at the lodge,

16
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:08,534
we could watch outdoor shows from all over
the world kind of compare our show to theirs.

17
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:11,104
Mind you, I guess that would be like
comparing apples and oranges.

18
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:12,605
Or apples and a lemon.

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,009
Sounds like sour grapes from a second
banana to me.

20
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:16,509
What do you think?

21
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:37,163
On today's show, we have the usual animals,
plus a four legged one visiting up at the

22
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:39,732
lodge, Ranger Gordon is watching out for fire
again.

23
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:45,438
There's one there and a report that and this
here, I really can't explain it.

24
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:46,939
You're just going to have to stay and watch.

25
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,413
I thought you said you'd never, ever, ever,
never, never, ever buy a satellite dish for

26
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,047
the launch.

27
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:55,515
I didn't buy one, Harold.

28
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:58,785
I made one. Oh no, not that patio umbrella
that you lined with

29
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,153
Foil potato chip bags.

30
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:05,258
Now, Harold, that one blew away one night
right in the middle of Baywatch.

31
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,662
No, no, we got a new one. This is a real
solid, made it out of the roof from the top

32
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:11,330
of the corn silo over at Farmer Nash's
place.

33
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:15,234
The roof? Yeah. Did he give it to you?

34
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,803
One of the finders keepers.

35
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:19,639
We've got a satellite dish.

36
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:22,575
Oh yeah, we got all the stations.

37
00:02:22,608 --> 00:02:26,112
Oh yeah, we're already getting about a
million stations, but now we're going to put

38
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:30,082
a motorized unit on there so that you can
change the game, you know, from satellite to

39
00:02:30,082 --> 00:02:32,185
satellite without leaving the comfort of
your TV room.

40
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,053
Oh wow, this is great.

41
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:37,490
We can use like the satellite to scan the
universe for signs of intelligent life.

42
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,225
Oh, we're not interested in intelligent life.

43
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:45,097
We want television. Coming up later on,
Bill's going to try.

44
00:02:46,465 --> 00:02:47,733
He's going to try a pogo stick.

45
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:49,735
Bill is a man of action.

46
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:53,539
I got a pogo stick is all action, and I'll
tell you something for every action.

47
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:56,609
There's an equal and opposite reaction.

48
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:01,747
And sometimes some water, OK?

49
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:02,648
This is the big one

50
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:05,918
For a free ice cream cone with any purchase
of a scoop of ice cream from the House of

51
00:03:05,918 --> 00:03:07,720
Vanilla. All right. All right.

52
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,388
You have 30 seconds to get Mr.

53
00:03:09,388 --> 00:03:10,990
Stevenson to say this word.

54
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,560
Thirty seconds go.

55
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:18,264
All right, Bob, wedding, divorce.

56
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,867
Wedlock head look.

57
00:03:23,602 --> 00:03:25,604
Matrimony. Alimony.

58
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:31,610
Not now, Bob, I think you've had five
ex-wives, so you've experienced this five

59
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,278
times.

60
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:34,613
Sex.

61
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,455
Oh, there are so many things your head can do
it and see thing, feel, talk and smell your

62
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:45,324
head as a part of your body, you should use
the most because it does so many things to a

63
00:03:45,324 --> 00:03:47,360
darn well. Use your head wisely.

64
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,862
Clean it protected. You can never go wrong.

65
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:53,599
But if you find yourself banging it against
a wall for hours and hours on end, that's a

66
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,668
pretty good chance. I've been married a
little bit too long.

67
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,906
Now we get a lot of questions for a range of
guard up here on the line.

68
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,810
And unfortunately, the only one I can repeat
on television is Ranger Gordon.

69
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,680
How many forest fires have you spotted from
the tower here?

70
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,983
Oh, well, red. Do you mean just this year or
all together?

71
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:11,450
No.

72
00:04:11,717 --> 00:04:13,285
Altogether, yeah. Altogether, yeah.

73
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:14,620
Let's see.

74
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:25,030
You can just round it off. Yeah, yeah.

75
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,475
Non fiction. Yeah.

76
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:40,980
Want to know the secret in being an
effective forest ranger or that coffee

77
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:42,248
coffee? That's right.

78
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:45,417
And I grind my own blend ranger Gord Java.

79
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:49,154
It consists of peach pits, acorns and these
coffee plant leaves.

80
00:04:49,588 --> 00:04:52,925
No Gordon. I believe that's poison ivy.

81
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,493
You got there, really?

82
00:04:54,493 --> 00:04:57,096
Yeah. Wow. Well, it works.

83
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:00,466
It works like the Dickens, you know, one cup
of this, and I'm up scratching my lips all

84
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:04,937
night. Here, let me mix you up a batch of
Ranger Gordon Java OK,

85
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,706
Cups, gasoline kind of high.

86
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:13,178
And also. Typekit, Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.

87
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:16,148
This is Fire Watch Tower 13, Fire Watch
Tower 13.

88
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:17,383
We've got a fire.

89
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,185
The coordinates. Where am I?

90
00:05:20,252 --> 00:05:21,720
I'm up in my tower here.

91
00:05:22,054 --> 00:05:24,089
Send a water bomber right away with lots of
people.

92
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,958
Ok? All right.

93
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,961
Fire is kind of out here. It's kind of it's
gone.

94
00:05:29,194 --> 00:05:31,230
It's done, it's done there.

95
00:05:31,697 --> 00:05:32,498
So, yeah,

96
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:39,204
You know, it's a good thing that I was here
to spot it and report

97
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:44,276
It and start it up.

98
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:49,148
At the lodge, we turn accidents into
opportunities as most of our parents did so

99
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:52,384
this week on Handymen Corner, I'm starting
with an accident.

100
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:56,388
This is the kind of thing that can happen
when you leave your car park between two

101
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:59,158
railroad tracks, and both trains come along
at the same time.

102
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,961
Now, I suppose we could collect up the
pieces and put them back together again.

103
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:06,965
But the problem there is the front end is
over in Halifax in the back half in

104
00:06:06,965 --> 00:06:10,803
Vancouver. At times like this, you wish you
had a smaller country.

105
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:15,374
So instead I'm going to take this unit and
turn it into something else.

106
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,510
Now what are the two favorite things that
men love to do most?

107
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:22,447
All right. Well, now since this is a family
show, although I'd certainly be frightened to

108
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:27,719
meet that family now, we're going to
restrict our two choices to driving a car and

109
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:28,720
watching television.

110
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:31,056
Now what if we can combine those two?

111
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,726
I'm not talking about just putting the
television set into a car.

112
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:39,765
I'm talking about somehow combining the
driving experience with watching television.

113
00:06:40,332 --> 00:06:45,103
So what I'm going to do is take a little bit
of ingenuity and this piece of garbage here

114
00:06:45,103 --> 00:06:48,840
and a piece of duct tape, a major railroad
accident.

115
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:54,479
I'm going to turn this dashboard into a
television remote controller, a man sized

116
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,815
Zapper. Sound ingenious.

117
00:06:56,882 --> 00:06:58,984
Sound incredible. Sound impossible.

118
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,652
Who cares? I'm not listening.

119
00:07:37,856 --> 00:07:39,891
It's going to work great with our new
satellite dish.

120
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:41,159
Let's start her up.

121
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,565
By flooding it.

122
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,135
There we go. There we go. Here she comes.

123
00:07:50,235 --> 00:07:51,636
There she goes. Oh yeah.

124
00:07:51,636 --> 00:07:54,706
And I can control the volume on the unit,
which is with my radio knob here.

125
00:07:55,874 --> 00:07:58,210
When I want to change channels, I just turn
the steering wheel.

126
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,946
I can call this turner broadcasting.

127
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:05,183
This has been taken and the beauty is I
don't use my turn signals, which I don't use

128
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:09,488
anyway, actually. And I got my panel light
dimmer there to control the brightness of the

129
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:17,996
TV. Inefficient spill, some stuff on there,
maybe even some pasta or any sort of meals,

130
00:08:17,996 --> 00:08:19,197
or what have you on to the screen, to the
TV?

131
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:23,235
I can clean that off because I got it all
hooked up to my washer and wiper control.

132
00:08:26,738 --> 00:08:28,940
All right now, I can just reach over to your
glove compartment.

133
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:31,676
Get out your TV guide.

134
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,478
You're browsing through that.

135
00:08:33,478 --> 00:08:36,448
I tell you something else. You know what's
great? The cigarette lighter can use that to

136
00:08:37,215 --> 00:08:38,950
heat up your coffee. Know.

137
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:41,052
Here we go. Just like that.

138
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:47,158
And the ashtray is a perfect spot to keep
any of your favorite snacks like good.

139
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:49,995
Way down on the bottom.

140
00:08:50,328 --> 00:08:53,265
Listen to the radio, uh, smoky flavor.

141
00:08:56,601 --> 00:09:02,407
And when there's nothing on TV, I just
switch over to my VCR where I've got fast

142
00:09:02,407 --> 00:09:08,113
forward or I've got freeze frame.

143
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:12,717
What am I going to watch this? This is my
favorite show.

144
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:18,623
Oh yeah. Oh, here's another feature I can
block out whatever Harold saying.

145
00:09:20,091 --> 00:09:21,226
Come on. Hurry up. Come on.

146
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:22,560
Come on. Come on.

147
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:24,829
Come on. Yeah.

148
00:09:24,996 --> 00:09:28,366
So remember, if the women don't find you
handsome, they should at least find your

149
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:32,370
handy. Oh hey, I like this part.

150
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:34,372
Oh, I'm going to watch that again.

151
00:09:35,206 --> 00:09:36,708
Rewind.

152
00:09:38,343 --> 00:09:41,813
Ranger Gord doesn't have his head in
the clouds, he's got the clouds in his head.

153
00:09:41,846 --> 00:09:42,914
Stay tuned.

154
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:49,554
Lot of you guys are asking me,
Red, I'm 40 something, but am I really

155
00:09:49,554 --> 00:09:51,623
middle aged? I'll tell you what.

156
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,691
Here's a few signs that I'll let you know.

157
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:56,594
You may already have lined up for a ticket
to Geyser City.

158
00:09:59,697 --> 00:10:02,133
Have you started putting the screws into a
glass jar?

159
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:17,949
And I'm not talking about this cruise, I
mean, old rusty pastry now with the bunged up

160
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:22,453
slots on them because it gives you a chance
to use your new label maker.

161
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:27,892
Have you turned down a hot tub party with
attractive naked people so you could stay

162
00:10:27,892 --> 00:10:34,265
around the house and putter as your
underwear gotten all homely and threadbare?

163
00:10:34,265 --> 00:10:38,269
Because there's no chance anybody other than
you, the wife and the heart attack emergency

164
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:46,444
unit are ever going to see you. Well, I'm
telling you, just relax, you're a normal,

165
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:48,746
virile male in the prime of life.

166
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,948
Middle age is just a state of mind.

167
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:54,452
And if you don't mention the state of mind
mind, I'll be happy to overlook yours.

168
00:10:55,486 --> 00:10:57,822
However, I'm pulling for you, we're all in
this together.

169
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:08,733
I with the satellite dish up and running
there, we thought we motorized her with a

170
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:11,235
couple of garage door openers, you know, and
kind of spin around this.

171
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:14,772
Then I got the idea why don't we use the
garage doors to have everything kind of

172
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:16,841
hidden away? Then when you want to watch TV,
you push a button.

173
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:20,344
She flips up, you know, and then all the
satellite dishes kind of move around and then

174
00:11:20,344 --> 00:11:22,647
you can flip a right back around when
there's a storm coming or something, you

175
00:11:22,647 --> 00:11:23,715
know? That's cool.

176
00:11:23,748 --> 00:11:25,349
Yeah, that's really cool. You know what
that's like?

177
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:27,085
That's like that show, Thunderbirds.

178
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:28,753
That's my most favorite show, right?

179
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,656
Yeah. Yeah, because when someone phones
international rescue, right, Mr.

180
00:11:31,656 --> 00:11:33,791
Tracy goes, Thunderbirds go and

181
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,626
Then they watch like.

182
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:39,630
The tough call, that's a very good shot, you
know,

183
00:11:40,798 --> 00:11:43,434
Oh, you know what, because then brains, he's
like my most favorite character in the whole

184
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:46,070
show is the brains. He's great because he'll
go launch Thunderbirds, right?

185
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:49,540
And then all these secret doors, they just
open right and come to this launch pad.

186
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,875
And there's this this red one, right?

187
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,344
It's the first one, and it goes and it goes,
it's gone, right?

188
00:11:53,511 --> 00:11:54,879
This is the first one he was told to go.

189
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:58,082
You go right. So then the sudden the
president goes, Thunderbird go, and the

190
00:11:58,082 --> 00:12:01,586
second one goes and he's like, green, you
know, like a like a frog or moose Thompson or

191
00:12:01,586 --> 00:12:05,223
something, right? So he goes, he's got to
write Thunderbird three go.

192
00:12:05,223 --> 00:12:08,192
And then this door where he goes Thunderbird
three, he's out of there, right?

193
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:09,293
I'll say, you know what happens? No, what
happens?

194
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,828
What happens now? What happens?

195
00:12:10,828 --> 00:12:12,396
Doors close, doors close.

196
00:12:12,396 --> 00:12:16,200
And it just looks like an island like
Gilligan's Island, which is my second most

197
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,769
favorite job. Well, right.

198
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:20,738
It is. I like Mary and I like Mary.

199
00:12:20,972 --> 00:12:22,807
I do. I like hearing a lot of people like
Ginger.

200
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,675
I think she's shallow. I do.

201
00:12:25,943 --> 00:12:28,045
She thought her desert island while she's
thinking about us.

202
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,714
Oh, how do I look? You know, like that?

203
00:12:29,814 --> 00:12:30,181
All right.

204
00:12:33,818 --> 00:12:35,519
What are we talking? I have no idea.

205
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,326
Hi, ranger, Gord. Way up here at Fire
Watchtower, 13.

206
00:12:42,893 --> 00:12:45,229
You know, a lot of people ask me, Do you
ever get bored up here?

207
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,701
Well, I say to them, Hey, how can I ever get
bored when I've got my imagination in so many

208
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:56,540
different clouds? Like, look at that one
that looks like Barbara Beam cutting the

209
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,309
line. Hey, look at that one.

210
00:12:58,342 --> 00:13:00,845
That one looks like Raquel Welch sharpening
her pencils.

211
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:05,383
Oh, look at that one that looks like one of
the women from Gilligan's Island.

212
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:11,622
Well, there's a woman smiling at me and
waving, and she just has a towel on.

213
00:13:14,892 --> 00:13:16,861
Ok, so let's say you're in real trouble.

214
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:18,295
Doesn't matter what for. Never does.

215
00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:23,367
No, but whatever the trouble is, we have a
few golden rules that all men follow to sort

216
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:24,034
of help you ease the

217
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:26,771
Squeeze rules that men have followed for
hundreds of years.

218
00:13:26,804 --> 00:13:27,838
We're going to pass them on to you.

219
00:13:27,872 --> 00:13:28,139
Yeah.

220
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:30,407
Ok, first of all, don't argue back.

221
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:32,176
It just it just winds them all up.

222
00:13:32,676 --> 00:13:35,546
The more you let her blow it all off, the
quicker you can get back to your normal

223
00:13:35,546 --> 00:13:36,147
routine.

224
00:13:38,215 --> 00:13:40,084
There's nothing that bugs a woman more than
someone who

225
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:42,887
Disagrees with him. No, that brings us to
rule number two.

226
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,755
Always agree with her, no matter what she
says.

227
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:48,392
Yeah, you got to look her straight in the eye
and go, You know something dear.

228
00:13:48,726 --> 00:13:50,060
You're absolutely right.

229
00:13:52,596 --> 00:13:54,465
Oh, the time, not a completely disarm them,
the

230
00:13:54,965 --> 00:13:58,202
Only trick, though, is you've got to be
humble for at least an hour afterwards, they

231
00:13:58,202 --> 00:13:59,570
otherwise you'll realize that you're pulling

232
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,940
Your chain. That brings us to rule number
three.

233
00:14:03,574 --> 00:14:05,342
Never underestimate a woman, OK?

234
00:14:05,376 --> 00:14:09,313
A woman is the most sophisticated, clever,
intuitive creature on the face of the Earth.

235
00:14:09,647 --> 00:14:11,582
You, on the other hand, are just a man.

236
00:14:13,651 --> 00:14:17,121
Tell you one thing, if you're talking
safety, you are not talking to us, Sherwin.

237
00:14:17,288 --> 00:14:21,058
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa.

238
00:14:21,258 --> 00:14:24,395
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Thank you.

239
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:26,030
You got a safety tip first.

240
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,465
Hey, two words red ATV.

241
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:31,602
All right. All right. I know what talking
about the all terrain vehicles.

242
00:14:31,635 --> 00:14:33,037
That's right. That's right. No, I got one.

243
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:34,872
So I know they are overpowered.

244
00:14:34,905 --> 00:14:36,907
They are skittish. They are hard to stop.

245
00:14:37,374 --> 00:14:40,311
Talk about fun. Whoa.

246
00:14:40,711 --> 00:14:42,279
So be careful you can get injured.

247
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:44,748
You mean from them tipping over easy or from
falling off?

248
00:14:44,748 --> 00:14:46,450
No, no. It seems to be the brakes.

249
00:14:46,483 --> 00:14:48,919
They they are just like, totally useless
when they're wet.

250
00:14:48,952 --> 00:14:50,554
So remember that safety first?

251
00:14:50,821 --> 00:14:51,989
Well, maybe the brakes just need to be
adjusted.

252
00:14:52,656 --> 00:14:53,857
Do you have the owner's manual buzz?

253
00:14:53,891 --> 00:14:55,225
Yeah, it's in the compartment under the
seat.

254
00:14:55,926 --> 00:14:57,161
Well, why don't you go get that?

255
00:14:57,161 --> 00:14:59,163
And we'll see what it says? Ok.

256
00:15:01,598 --> 00:15:11,408
Oh. Well, I hope that that satellite dish
thirty six hours ago and the guys

257
00:15:11,408 --> 00:15:13,110
haven't stopped watching TV.

258
00:15:13,377 --> 00:15:17,648
You know, the more average North American
watches six hours of TV a day, you know that?

259
00:15:17,648 --> 00:15:21,452
Yeah, I heard that if we didn't watch that
much TV, we'd have like time to earn six

260
00:15:21,452 --> 00:15:24,888
college degrees, maintain five hobbies and
being peak physical condition.

261
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:26,590
Wow. Is that true? Where'd you hear that?

262
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,292
I don't know. Some show I was watching.

263
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,995
Mean these guys haven't even taken a bathroom
break.

264
00:15:32,196 --> 00:15:35,899
Junior sink was down there hopping from one
foot to the other, yelling Buy a foul by a

265
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:36,433
vowel.

266
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:40,003
That's buy a vowel.

267
00:15:40,037 --> 00:15:41,138
Uncle Ray, they're watching

268
00:15:41,138 --> 00:15:43,574
Wheel of Fortune now they're watching E.R..

269
00:15:45,576 --> 00:15:47,644
Ok, I'll get him out of the TV room, don't
you worry.

270
00:15:47,744 --> 00:15:50,480
All right. All right. I tell you what you can
do smack on the head with that if you have

271
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:50,714
to.

272
00:15:51,114 --> 00:15:52,749
A New York City phone book?

273
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:54,785
No, no. That's the satellite TV guide.

274
00:15:56,486 --> 00:15:57,788
Look at all these mindless stuff.

275
00:15:57,788 --> 00:15:59,890
Look at that. Huh? Boy, Thunderbirds
Guttenberg.

276
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:03,961
Channel five hundred and sixty two.

277
00:16:04,027 --> 00:16:06,163
That's a I've only seen this one five times,
it's a group.

278
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:10,968
The safety smart, handy man knows you should
always start each new project with a clean

279
00:16:10,968 --> 00:16:20,944
workspace. Today, we got an adventure with
Bill for all of you teenagers who

280
00:16:21,044 --> 00:16:23,080
should be studying physics instead of
physics.

281
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:27,751
We're going to kind of concentrate on one of
Newton's laws here, and I don't mean the one

282
00:16:27,751 --> 00:16:32,089
with the fig in it. This is the one that
says for every action, there's an equal and

283
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:33,090
opposite reaction.

284
00:16:33,123 --> 00:16:37,694
I got the pogo stick there and Bill's adding
energy, so I'm going to try to subtract a

285
00:16:37,694 --> 00:16:39,162
little bit jumping down on the pogo stick.

286
00:16:39,196 --> 00:16:40,063
There he compresses it.

287
00:16:40,163 --> 00:16:44,935
Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, all right.

288
00:16:45,235 --> 00:16:49,005
Now you see, that wouldn't have gone nearly
as far if he hadn't put as much energy into

289
00:16:49,005 --> 00:16:50,440
the pole, because that's a that's a valuable
lesson.

290
00:16:51,007 --> 00:16:52,242
About 80 bucks.

291
00:16:52,242 --> 00:16:54,978
I think it was. Phil's got an idea.

292
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:56,780
Oh boy, is that good news?

293
00:16:57,047 --> 00:16:58,815
I'm thinking. Probably not.

294
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:02,853
This is the TV antenna tower that we no
longer need now that we got the satellite

295
00:17:02,853 --> 00:17:07,157
dish. So Bill thinking, Hey, wait a minute,
maybe I can just use this for a project.

296
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:10,827
Still fun to watch, isn't he?

297
00:17:12,195 --> 00:17:17,134
What? There's the action, there's a
reaction.

298
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:20,637
Appreciate that, Bill.

299
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:25,909
And recycle the air and oh no, it's fine,
you don't care, it's not your truck anyway,

300
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:29,446
she's going to use a tower part like at this
point, we've kind of made a commitment.

301
00:17:30,547 --> 00:17:32,916
So we want to be down there and just walk.

302
00:17:33,216 --> 00:17:36,720
You should warn a person when you put
something down.

303
00:17:37,554 --> 00:17:38,755
Took me a while to catch my breath.

304
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:42,158
I was OK. I should have kept my eye out
bill, I guess.

305
00:17:44,094 --> 00:17:45,662
We'll be back to finish that when I regained
consciousness.

306
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,764
Stay tuned.

307
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:52,636
Well, thirty seven hours and
counting since I hooked up the satellite

308
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:57,040
dish, not one person who's wandered into
that TV room has come out alive.

309
00:17:58,074 --> 00:18:03,113
I haven't seen that many slack jawed, dull
eyed blank expression since my Grade 10 class

310
00:18:03,113 --> 00:18:04,247
picture.

311
00:18:04,581 --> 00:18:05,615
It's so quiet in here.

312
00:18:05,615 --> 00:18:08,084
The mice are coming out of the wall and just
joining us.

313
00:18:08,084 --> 00:18:10,020
It's just. It's too quiet.

314
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:17,127
I hate it way, way too quiet here to join
the lodge and be here to join the lodge

315
00:18:17,127 --> 00:18:18,928
because we can on the TV room.

316
00:18:18,928 --> 00:18:21,231
Yeah, it's that way.

317
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:28,338
Oh, oh, I'm OK.

318
00:18:29,105 --> 00:18:32,442
Ok, read read you OK, man, I'm OK.

319
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:36,780
Oh, you're going to fly like that?

320
00:18:36,846 --> 00:18:38,548
Get doors on the plane. Yeah.

321
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:44,687
What's in the expert portion of the show and
on this week's expert parts of the show, we

322
00:18:44,687 --> 00:18:47,190
have the experts Michael Redd and its good
friend, Doug E.

323
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:56,800
Franklin. Our first letter goes as follows
Dear

324
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,501
experts, huh?

325
00:18:59,002 --> 00:19:03,339
Recently, recently, my girlfriend and I were
out cruising in my Camaro on our way to a

326
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:07,644
street race when she pulled her scarf off my
rearview mirror and told me it was all over

327
00:19:07,644 --> 00:19:12,782
between us. Oh all right, the next night,
next night, I saw her on the back of some

328
00:19:12,782 --> 00:19:13,850
guy's motorcycle.

329
00:19:13,883 --> 00:19:16,085
How can I win back the girl of my dreams?

330
00:19:16,286 --> 00:19:17,320
Rap in Boston?

331
00:19:18,688 --> 00:19:21,191
Well, I'll tell you, fella, I

332
00:19:21,191 --> 00:19:23,193
Think if you want her back, this is what you
got to do.

333
00:19:23,326 --> 00:19:25,128
You got to get your vehicle into the shop.

334
00:19:25,228 --> 00:19:28,398
You got to get your rings done and your
headers chrome.

335
00:19:31,901 --> 00:19:34,170
What you're saying is this romance just needs
a little tune up.

336
00:19:34,304 --> 00:19:37,106
Well, yeah, in a matter of words, yeah, a way
of speaking.

337
00:19:37,106 --> 00:19:38,908
I would say that romance red.

338
00:19:38,908 --> 00:19:41,311
She is like your internal combustion engine.

339
00:19:42,545 --> 00:19:46,416
If you want her to run smooth, you got to
maintain your spark.

340
00:19:47,383 --> 00:19:52,522
Now my advice to bereft is check your timing
gap your plugs.

341
00:19:52,555 --> 00:19:54,257
You may not need that jump start.

342
00:19:56,326 --> 00:19:57,860
All right. I don't think it's very
flattering.

343
00:19:58,328 --> 00:20:00,330
People don't want their love life compared
to a slant.

344
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:00,863
Six.

345
00:20:02,332 --> 00:20:05,501
It's an accurate comparison, though, and I
think Berraf has just got to hope that the

346
00:20:05,501 --> 00:20:10,340
problem is only the spark, because if it
ain't the spark, then it's the gas.

347
00:20:10,406 --> 00:20:15,745
We all know how quickly you can kill a
romance when you are backfiring

348
00:20:15,745 --> 00:20:16,579
Down lovers lane.

349
00:20:21,517 --> 00:20:25,822
Meanwhile, back at the science lesson, I got
an ice pack on my head there, and Bill's got

350
00:20:25,822 --> 00:20:27,890
a drainpipe and he's got this thing and he's
got a bungee.

351
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:36,199
Meanwhile, back at the science lesson, I
have two ice packs and the bill has cut the

352
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:37,834
tower down. He's got a drainpipe.

353
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:38,901
He's got bungee cords.

354
00:20:38,901 --> 00:20:40,069
And he's what? He's done this.

355
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,840
What has he done? Oh my gosh.

356
00:20:44,006 --> 00:20:47,009
He's made a gi gundu pogo stick.

357
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,580
Holy mackerel. You know you got to hand it
to cold.

358
00:20:52,315 --> 00:20:53,616
Bill dries my ear.

359
00:20:54,784 --> 00:20:57,453
I recently brought the van in which I wish
he had explained to me earlier.

360
00:20:58,121 --> 00:21:01,424
He's going to jump up on top of her there,
so he has a higher mountain.

361
00:21:01,457 --> 00:21:05,528
And then if young people are listening to
this, you should pay attention to because you

362
00:21:05,528 --> 00:21:06,863
see your father from the center of the
Earth.

363
00:21:07,196 --> 00:21:12,134
And I believe the gravity pulls down on you
with more gravity, and I'm a prop that up to

364
00:21:12,134 --> 00:21:15,771
him. And here's the action he's going to
take by stepping on that.

365
00:21:16,205 --> 00:21:20,109
And here's the reaction I'm going to take if
I get the heck out of the way.

366
00:21:20,243 --> 00:21:24,413
There he goes. Look at the world's largest
pogo stick between evil, an evil entity that

367
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,015
won't watch your bill is a big hit, big
hole.

368
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:28,618
Oh, don't you look at that reaction?

369
00:21:28,618 --> 00:21:29,685
Oh my.

370
00:21:32,355 --> 00:21:33,522
Class is dismissed.

371
00:21:38,327 --> 00:21:45,701
Ok. Something's wrong with the satellite
feed, we're not getting a good picture, a

372
00:21:45,768 --> 00:21:48,037
comment. Oh really, Harold.

373
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:53,509
I'm sorry, I was gone. How long is it gone?

374
00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:54,543
Like half an hour, huh?

375
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:55,845
Twelve and a half hours, Harold?

376
00:21:57,747 --> 00:21:59,482
No. Oh yes, we know.

377
00:21:59,615 --> 00:22:02,385
I just saw because I just watched like that
one rerun of vanished.

378
00:22:02,652 --> 00:22:05,788
And then there's a little bit of the car
race, you know, and then I watch Best

379
00:22:05,855 --> 00:22:07,323
Celebrity Circus, you know?

380
00:22:07,323 --> 00:22:11,627
And then there was there was those few game
shows in there and some music videos.

381
00:22:11,627 --> 00:22:13,295
And then there's those people line dancing.

382
00:22:13,329 --> 00:22:16,599
But I watch that infomercial about the
sunglasses, you see the watch and then model

383
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:18,768
Zinke was on. And what year is it now?

384
00:22:21,337 --> 00:22:24,540
Oh, to hear that, to hear that, I think
there's an episode of Lassie starting here.

385
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,875
That's a call meaning.

386
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:26,976
Yeah, yeah.

387
00:22:27,076 --> 00:22:30,179
Oh, because, you know, because it sounded
like Star Trek or Next Generation

388
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,648
Carol, it's the meet and get down there right
now.

389
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,284
It's the meat. Yeah.

390
00:22:35,918 --> 00:22:36,051
Right.

391
00:22:39,321 --> 00:22:42,658
So if my wife is watching, I'll be coming
straight home after the meet and I am sick to

392
00:22:42,658 --> 00:22:43,826
death of television.

393
00:22:44,226 --> 00:22:46,362
I'm going to stop at
the video store and get a movie.

394
00:22:47,596 --> 00:22:51,233
Rest of you, thanks so much for watching on behalf of
myself and Harold and the whole gang up here

395
00:22:51,233 --> 00:22:51,967
at Possum Lodge,

396
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:53,169
keep your stick on the ice.

397
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:02,478
(Possum squealing)

398
00:23:09,652 --> 00:23:12,621
Quando omni flunkus moritati.
