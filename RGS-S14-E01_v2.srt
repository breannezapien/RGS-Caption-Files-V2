00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:58,643
AHA!

161
00:07:58,643 --> 00:08:01,913
I THINK A DOG KNOWS
ENOUGH NOT TO EAT
ITS SERVING DISH.

162
00:08:03,915 --> 00:08:04,983
DOGS!

163
00:08:04,983 --> 00:08:07,719
DOGS BARK AT THEIR
OWN REFLECTIONS.

164
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,157
THEY LICK PLACES I
CAN'T EVEN SAY ON TV.

165
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:15,126
IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE.

166
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:17,128
I'M PRETTY SURE
I KNOW DOGS WELL ENOUGH

167
00:08:17,128 --> 00:08:18,530
THAT A DOG WOULD
EAT THAT DISH

168
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,931
AND THEN HE'D
LICK THE FLOOR

169
00:08:19,931 --> 00:08:22,300
AND THEN WASH IT ALL DOWN
WITH A BIG GULP OF
TOILET BOWL WATER.

170
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:40,352
WHAT ELSE DO YOU
HAVE FOR US, FRANK?

171
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:43,321
WELL, NOTHING SAYS
ROMANCE LIKE CANDLES.

172
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:45,223
AND YOU JUST
CAN'T GO WRONG

173
00:08:45,223 --> 00:08:48,960
WITH THESE ALL BEEF
CANDLE STICKS.

174
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,196
AND THE BEST PART IS

175
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:53,298
THEY'RE SCENTED.

176
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:57,602
IS THAT HICKORY?
YES, IT IS.

177
00:08:57,602 --> 00:08:59,037
I THOUGHT SO.

178
00:08:59,037 --> 00:09:02,941
IT ALSO COMES IN
BARBEQUE, GARLIC, CAJUN

179
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:04,442
WHICH ISN'T A FLAVOUR,

180
00:09:04,442 --> 00:09:07,012
BUT IT REALLY
IMPRESSES THE LADIES.

181
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,016
OH, ALSO HAVE SOMETHING
VERY SPECIAL HERE.

182
00:09:11,016 --> 00:09:13,251
TADA!

183
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:16,087
GUESS WHO THAT IS.

184
00:09:18,623 --> 00:09:21,026
SIGOURNEY WIENER?

185
00:09:23,261 --> 00:09:24,562
NO.

186
00:09:24,562 --> 00:09:26,765
MR. STUPID HOT DOG HEAD?
I DON'T KNOW!

187
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:28,466
YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT'S ACTUALLY MY FAULT,

188
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:30,602
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T
QUITE FINISHED IT YET.

189
00:09:30,602 --> 00:09:32,871
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
IT'S HIS FAULT.

190
00:09:32,871 --> 00:09:34,105
CAN'T BLAME ME.

191
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:35,640
WHEN I SAY
IT WAS MY FAULT,
I WAS JUST BEING POLITE.

192
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,075
OH.

193
00:09:42,046 --> 00:09:43,581
HA! THAT'S ME!

194
00:09:43,581 --> 00:09:45,617
WE HAVE A WIENER.

195
00:09:45,617 --> 00:09:47,051
THAT'S GOOD.

196
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:51,456
THE TEENAGE YEARS
ARE PAINFUL, DIFFICULT

197
00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:52,757
AND AWKWARD.

198
00:09:52,757 --> 00:09:54,893
AND NOT JUST
FOR THE PARENTS,

199
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:56,761
ESPECIALLY IF THE TEENS GET
INTERESTED IN HOBBIES

200
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:58,496
LIKE KNOCKING OVER
LIQUOR STORES

201
00:09:58,496 --> 00:10:00,865
OR BEATING UP THE ELDERLY.

202
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:02,734
AND THE MOST
DANGEROUS STUFF IN LIFE

203
00:10:02,734 --> 00:10:04,335
HAPPENS LATE AT NIGHT,

204
00:10:04,335 --> 00:10:07,438
WHICH YOU PROVED
DURING THEIR CONCEPTION.

205
00:10:07,438 --> 00:10:09,908
SO THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT
BAD THINGS FROM HAPPENING

206
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:13,144
IS TO GET YOUR KIDS TO
COME HOME AT A DECENT HOUR.

207
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:15,780
TO DO THAT YOU NEED
SOMETHING TO ATTRACT THEM.

208
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,316
YOU KNOW, OTHER THAN THE
$5,000 WORTH OF VIDEO GAMES

209
00:10:18,316 --> 00:10:20,885
AND COMPUTER EQUIPMENT
YOU BOUGHT 'EM.

210
00:10:20,885 --> 00:10:22,287
YOU NEED A LURE,

211
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:23,721
A TEEN TRAP.

212
00:10:23,721 --> 00:10:25,423
SEE, WHEN A
TEENAGER GETS HOME,

213
00:10:25,423 --> 00:10:27,258
FIRST PLACE HE
GOES IS THE FRIDGE.

214
00:10:27,258 --> 00:10:29,193
A FRIDGE DOOR
HAS MAGICAL POWERS

215
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:31,829
THAT DRAWS IN
ALL TEENAGERS.

216
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:34,098
MAYBE IT'S FROM THE MAGNETS
ON THERE, I DUNNO.

217
00:10:34,098 --> 00:10:37,602
BUT THE SAME KID WHO CAN'T
FOCUS ON THE BLACKBOARD
FOR 30 SECONDS

218
00:10:37,602 --> 00:10:39,270
WILL SPEND AN HOUR,
BENT OVER,

219
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,239
STARING INTO THIS BABY.

220
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:43,508
SO TAKE THAT POWER

221
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:45,543
AND USE IT...

222
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:49,147
ON THE FRONT
OF YOUR HOUSE.

223
00:10:49,147 --> 00:10:51,282
NOW WHEN YOUR KID
IS OUT A NIGHT, DANCING

224
00:10:51,282 --> 00:10:53,718
OR THROWING ROCKS
AT TRAFFIC OR WHATEVER,

225
00:10:53,718 --> 00:10:55,253
HE'LL REMEMBER
THIS FRIDGE DOOR,

226
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:58,323
AND HE'LL WANNA COME RUNNIN'
HOME TO SEE WHAT'S INSIDE.

227
00:10:58,323 --> 00:11:00,525
AND HERE'S
AN ADDED BONUS...

228
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:03,428
HE'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO SNEAK INTO THE HOUSE.

229
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:10,368
[ LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE ]

230
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:19,811
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY
THAT IN A MAN'S LIFE

231
00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:22,346
HE'LL OWN AT LEAST 10 CARS.

232
00:11:22,346 --> 00:11:26,050
WELL, MAYBE NOT "OWN",
BUT AT LEAST MAKE PAYMENTS ON.

233
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,219
GUYS GET DIFFERENT
TYPES OF VEHICLES,

234
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:30,655
DEPENDING ON THEIR AGE
AND SITUATION.

235
00:11:30,655 --> 00:11:32,957
AT FIRST IT'S
SOMETHING SLEEK AND SPORTY

236
00:11:32,957 --> 00:11:34,892
THAT SAYS,
I'M SINGLE AND FAST,

237
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:38,529
AND THERE'S NO ROOM FOR A BABY
CARRIAGE IN THIS UNIT.

238
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:41,232
BUT AFTER A FEW MILES AND A
BUNCH OF SERVICE CENTRES,

239
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:43,434
THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

240
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:45,803
HE'S NOT A
SPORTS CAR ANYMORE.

241
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:47,772
WHAT WAS ONCE
SLEEK AND SPORTY,

242
00:11:47,772 --> 00:11:50,341
IS NOW MEEK AND FORTY.

243
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:52,376
HE'S A MINIVAN.

244
00:11:52,376 --> 00:11:54,412
BUT HE DOESN'T
CALL IT A MINIVAN.

245
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:56,981
HE CALLS IT
A "MAGIC WAGON".

246
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:59,784
OH, SURE, A RUSTED OUT
DUMPSTER ON WHEELS

247
00:11:59,784 --> 00:12:02,153
IS A MAGIC WAGON.

248
00:12:02,153 --> 00:12:04,755
AND DANDRUFF
IS FAIRY DUST.

249
00:12:04,755 --> 00:12:08,726
THE CAR YOU DRIVE IS A
MIRROR OF YOUR OWN VITALITY.

250
00:12:08,726 --> 00:12:11,229
AND HAVE YOU LOOKED
IN THAT MIRROR LATELY?

251
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:15,666
"OBJECTS MAY APPEAR
OLDER THAN THEY ARE."

252
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,168
NOT PRETTY, IS IT?

253
00:12:17,168 --> 00:12:19,337
BIG AND SLOW,
AIRBAGS EVERYWHERE

254
00:12:19,337 --> 00:12:21,806
AND A HUGE TRUNK.

255
00:12:21,806 --> 00:12:23,341
BUT HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS.

256
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:26,110
AT THIS POINT,
YOU DON'T NEED SPEED.

257
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,712
YOU DON'T HAVE
VERY FAR TO GO,

258
00:12:27,712 --> 00:12:30,748
AND YOU SURE DON'T
NEED TO GET THERE EARLY.

259
00:12:30,748 --> 00:12:33,084
JUST RELAX, TAKE
YOUR FOOT OFF THE GAS,

260
00:12:33,084 --> 00:12:36,020
AND DO WHAT YOU SPENT
YOUR WHOLE LIFE PERFECTING,

261
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,455
COAST.

262
00:12:38,356 --> 00:12:40,124
REMEMBER,
I'M PULLIN' FOR YOU.

263
00:12:40,124 --> 00:12:42,059
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

264
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:46,197
[ APPLAUSE ]

265
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:48,299
YOU THINK
FEAR FACTOR'S GROSS,

266
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:50,167
I EAT WITH THESE HANDS!

267
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:03,347
WELL, THE BARBEQUE
GAMES WERE SO SUCCESSFUL,

268
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:06,717
WE'RE TAKING RED'S HOT SAUCE
TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL.

269
00:13:06,717 --> 00:13:09,053
WE'RE GOIN' COMMERCIAL.

270
00:13:09,053 --> 00:13:11,555
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH
TO HAVE A PRODUCT.

271
00:13:11,555 --> 00:13:14,091
YOU ALSO HAVE TO HAVE
THE MARKETING.

272
00:13:14,091 --> 00:13:16,560
I MEAN, WHERE WOULD
PAUL NEWMAN SALAD DRESSING BE

273
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,429
WITHOUT PAUL NEWMAN?

274
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:20,898
OR MICHELIN TIRES WITHOUT
THE BIG, HAIRLESS, FRENCH,

275
00:13:20,898 --> 00:13:24,068
ALBINO, MARSHMALLOW GUY?

276
00:13:24,068 --> 00:13:27,371
OR JANET JACKSON
WITHOUT THE SUPERBOWL?

277
00:13:30,574 --> 00:13:33,944
SO OUR MARKETING GIMMICK
IS OUR PACKAGING.

278
00:13:33,944 --> 00:13:36,313
IT'S A WATER PISTOL, HUH?

279
00:13:36,313 --> 00:13:38,549
NOW YOU CAN SPICE
UP YOUR STEAK,

280
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:42,052
WITHOUT EVEN GETTING
OUT OF YOUR LAWN CHAIR.

281
00:13:42,052 --> 00:13:45,656
YOU CAN SHOOT
YOUR GAME TWICE.

282
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:47,725
AND I GOT A
NEW NAME FOR IT...

283
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:51,362
RED'S SATURDAY
NIGHT SPECIAL SAUCE.

284
00:13:51,362 --> 00:13:53,364
IF YOU'RE GOIN'
TO A PARTY,

285
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:56,066
MAKE SURE
YOU'RE PACKIN' HEAT.

286
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:57,735
UNCLE RED! UNCLE RED!

287
00:13:57,735 --> 00:14:00,104
WHAT IS THE SECRET
INGREDIENT IN THAT SAUCE?

288
00:14:00,104 --> 00:14:01,672
I DUNNO, HAROLD.

289
00:14:01,672 --> 00:14:02,940
SEE, THAT'S THE
BEAUTY OF IT.

290
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,208
NOBODY KNOWS.

291
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,743
I WENT UP TO THE UNIVERSITY
AND TOOK THIS UP TO THE LAB,

292
00:14:05,743 --> 00:14:07,378
AND THEY'VE
ANALYZED IT, RIGHT.

293
00:14:07,378 --> 00:14:09,079
OH, NO, HAROLD,
WAIT A SEC.

294
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:10,848
THE TIME HAS COME.

295
00:14:10,848 --> 00:14:12,683
IT'S JET FUEL.

296
00:14:15,853 --> 00:14:17,421
WOW!

297
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:19,890
YOU CANNOT
SELL THAT SAUCE!

298
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:23,260
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE
BLOWING UP.

299
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,497
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
THAT'S A GENERALIZATION.

300
00:14:26,497 --> 00:14:30,901
AND SECONDLY, WE'RE NOT
GONNA SELL IT AS
BARBEQUE SAUCE.

301
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:34,471
WE'RE GONNA SELL IT
AS GASOLINE ADDITIVE.

302
00:14:34,471 --> 00:14:35,973
WE'RE GONNA MAKE
A KILLING, HAROLD.

303
00:14:35,973 --> 00:14:37,474
EXACTLY!

304
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,249
Red: WE ALL AGREED TO MEET
OUT BEHIND THE LODGE

305
00:14:45,249 --> 00:14:46,650
AND FIX THE PICKET FENCE.

306
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,851
ARE GOING TO HELP OUT.  ANR

307
00:14:47,851 --> 00:14:49,620
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE BALE OF STRAW --

308
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,489
GUYS, WE'RE DOIN'
THE PICKET FENCE.

309
00:14:52,489 --> 00:14:53,824
NO, NO, YOU AGREED --

310
00:14:53,824 --> 00:14:56,360
WHAT'S THE STRAW --
WHAT'S THE BALE OF STRAW FOR?

311
00:14:58,429 --> 00:15:00,330
OKAY, THEY'RE GONNA
DO SOME KIND OF ARCHERY.

312
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,698
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN', BILL?

313
00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:03,434
WHAT IS THAT?

314
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:06,203
HE'S GOT A --

471
00:21:30,152 --> 00:21:32,154
BECAUSE APPARENTLY
THE STUFF BLOWS UP.

472
00:21:32,154 --> 00:21:36,826
SO I WOULD SUGGEST YOU GET THAT
OUT OF YOUR GAS TANK IMMEDIATELY

473
00:21:36,826 --> 00:21:39,762
UNLESS YOUR CAR IS A RENTAL.
