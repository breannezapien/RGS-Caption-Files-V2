00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:41,238
EVER KNOW AND I THINK THE POLE

542
00:15:41,238 --> 00:15:43,874
IS A TERRIFIC IDEA THERE

543
00:15:43,874 --> 00:15:44,842
'CAUSE IT KIND OF MARKS,

544
00:15:44,842 --> 00:15:46,543
AT LEAST TO ME

545
00:15:46,543 --> 00:15:47,578
TO BILL IT WASN'T YOU KNOW

546
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:48,712
BUT TO ME I WAS USING THAT AS

547
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:51,048
KIND OF A MARKER.

548
00:15:51,048 --> 00:15:51,848
BUT BILL FOUND A CARROT

549
00:15:51,848 --> 00:15:52,683
THERE WHICH WAS AN IDEA

550
00:15:52,683 --> 00:15:54,618
I WAS GOING TO KIND OF USE

551
00:15:54,618 --> 00:15:55,552
THAT TO BAIT ANOTHER TYPE

552
00:15:55,552 --> 00:15:56,520

OH! OH! OH! OH! OH!

555
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:02,693

MY WAY CLEAR TO GIVING YOU

00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,172
A LIFT MAYBE.

674
00:19:36,172 --> 00:19:39,809
YOU'LL DO SOMETHING

675
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:40,710

678
00:19:42,845 --> 00:19:43,513
>>RED: WELL A TIRE AND SOME

679
00:19:43,513 --> 00:19:45,682
MATCHES FOR OUR ALTERNATE

680
00:19:45,682 --> 00:19:49,619
FUEL WOODSTOVE PROJECT THING.

681
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:52,221
>>HAP: OH TRICKY THINGS

682
00:19:52,221 --> 00:19:53,623
ALTERNATIVE FUELS

683
00:19:53,623 --> 00:19:54,891
I REMEMBER THE PROBLEMS WE HAD

684
00:19:54,891 --> 00:19:56,259
BACK IN THE 50'S WHEN I WORKED

685
00:19:56,259 --> 00:19:58,161
ON THE ATOMIC BUICK.

686
00:19:58,161 --> 00:19:59,495
>>RED: HEY HAP DID YOU

687
00:19:59,495 --> 00:20:02,532
SAY ATOMIC BUICK?

688
00:20:02,532 --> 00:20:04,200
>>HAP: A PROTON POWERED 4-DOOR

689
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,535
SEDAN WITH A NUCLEAR FAMILY

690
00:20:05,535 --> 00:20:07,637
NO PISTONS, NO POLLUTION

691
00:20:07,637 --> 00:20:09,806
NO OIL TO CHANGE.

692
00:20:09,806 --> 00:20:11,841
I DESIGNED THE TRANSMISSION

693
00:20:11,841 --> 00:20:13,409
EINSTEIN DESIGNED THE ENGINE

694
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:15,411
AND A WOMAN NAMED ENOLA GAY

695
00:20:15,411 --> 00:20:17,814
DESIGNED THE EXHAUST SYSTEM.

696
00:20:17,814 --> 00:20:18,581
>>RED: I NEVER HEARD OF

697
00:20:18,581 --> 00:20:19,549
AN ATOMIC BUICK.

698
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:21,651
>>HAP: WELL WHY WOULD YOU?

699
00:20:21,651 --> 00:20:22,418
WE DIDN'T GET IT PAST

700
00:20:22,418 --> 00:20:24,921
THE PROTOTYPE STAGE

701
00:20:24,921 --> 00:20:25,822
IN SECOND GEAR THE ATOMIC

702
00:20:25,822 --> 00:20:27,290
REACTOR OR WHAT WE CALLED

703
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,424
THE ATOMIC PILE WOULD

704
00:20:28,424 --> 00:20:31,294
OVERHEAT AND BACKFIRE

705
00:20:31,294 --> 00:20:32,528
A MUSHROOM CLOUD THAT'LL

706
00:20:32,528 --> 00:20:35,131
FLATTEN A CITY BLOCK.

707
00:20:35,131 --> 00:20:35,798
>>RED: BOY I GUESS THAT

708
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:37,366
WOULD PUT AN END TO TAILGATERS.

709
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:39,168
>>HAP: YES SIR, BUT IT WAS A

710
00:20:39,168 --> 00:20:42,138
SAFE CAR, SOLID LEAD AND INSTEAD

711
00:20:42,138 --> 00:20:43,706
OF HEADLIGHTS RED I DESIGNED IT

712
00:20:43,706 --> 00:20:45,575
SO THE WHOLE FRONT OF THE CAR

713
00:20:45,575 --> 00:20:48,778
GLOWED AND FAST ZERO TO THE

714
00:20:48,778 --> 00:20:51,514
SPEED OF LIGHT IN 14 SECONDS.

715
00:20:51,514 --> 00:20:53,716
>>RED: WOW THAT IS HARD

716
00:20:53,716 --> 00:20:55,952
TO BELIEVE ACTUALLY

717
00:20:55,952 --> 00:20:56,619
IS WHAT THAT IS.

718
00:20:56,619 --> 00:20:57,520
>>HAP: IT'S TOO BAD IT DIDN'T

719
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,521
WORK OUT BECAUSE THAT CAR GOT

720
00:20:58,521 --> 00:21:04,327
800 MILLION MILES TO THE GALLON.

721
00:21:04,327 --> 00:21:05,862
BUT THE BIG OIL COMPANIES

722
00:21:05,862 --> 00:21:07,530
BOUGHT UP ALL THE PATENTS AND

723
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,365
DISBANDED MY DESIGN TEAM

724
00:21:09,365 --> 00:21:10,500
AND MELTED DOWN THE LEAD

725
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,335
AND SCRAPPED THE ATOMIC PILE

726
00:21:12,335 --> 00:21:13,503
TO THIS DAY NO ONE KNOWS

727
00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:15,538
WHERE THAT PILE IS.

728
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:16,405
>>RED: WELL I WOULD THINK YOU'D

729
00:21:16,405 --> 00:21:20,243
BE SITTING IN IT ABOUT NOW.

730
00:21:28,618 --> 00:21:31,787

OR A GARDEN SHED OR A COUPLE

735
00:21:37,226 --> 00:21:41,230
OF CATHEDRALS.

736
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,765
