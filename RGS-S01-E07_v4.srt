AND BY GOLLY, I'M HERE

172
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:19,812
FOR THE EVENING.

173
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,747
SO UNTIL NEXT TIME, REMEMBER,

174
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:22,881
IF THE WOMEN DON'T FIND YOU

175
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:24,483
HANDSOME, THEY SHOULD AT LEAST

176
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:26,451
FIND YOU HANDY.

177
00:06:28,787 --> 00:06:30,022
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER THIS

178
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,757
COMMERCIAL BREAK WITH MORE ABOUT

179
00:06:31,757 --> 00:06:33,559
THE HE-MAN CONTEST STORY.

180
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,593
>> IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN, GET

181
00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:36,395
THEM OUT OF THE ROOM NOW!

182
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:38,130
JUST IN CASE.

183
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,532
I WOULD.

184
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:45,737
>> WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

185
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:49,141
>> BOY, DID YOU SEE THE GAME

186
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:49,908
LAST NIGHT?

187
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:51,143
>> I WAS RATHER DISTURBED BY IT.

188
00:06:51,143 --> 00:06:52,210
>> OH, OH, YOU SEE THAT CHECK?

189
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,378
>> YEAH.

190
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:54,212
>> RIGHT INTO THE BOARDS.

191
00:06:54,212 --> 00:06:55,847
AND I THINK HIS HEAD WAS SPLIT.

192
00:06:55,847 --> 00:06:56,648
HIS--IT HAD TO BE.

193
00:06:56,648 --> 00:06:57,316
BANGED HIS HEAD.

194
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:57,983
>> IT DEFINITELY WAS.

195
00:06:57,983 --> 00:06:58,684
>> OH, YEAH.

196
00:06:58,684 --> 00:06:59,518
>> BY THE AMOUNT OF BLOOD ON THE

197
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:00,285
ICE, I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY

198
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:01,520
SOMETHING WAS WRONG.

199
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,955
>> HE HAD A HEADACHE THERE,

200
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:03,655
DIDN'T HE?

201
00:07:03,655 --> 00:07:04,790
>> WELL, TODAY'S HE'S GONNA WAKE

202
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,258
UP AND GO, "SOMETHING HAPPENED

203
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:07,159
LAST NIGHT."

204
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:08,026
>> YOU WANT TO BELIEVE IT.

205
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:08,894
>> THERE'S TOO MUCH VIOLENCE IN

206
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:09,594
SPORTS, UNCLE RED.

207
00:07:09,594 --> 00:07:10,362
AND I DON'T THINK--YOU SEEM

208
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:11,029
TO BE ADVOCATING--

209
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:12,197
>> NOW, DON'T.

210
00:07:12,197 --> 00:07:13,198
>> IT'S A FEELING I GET FROM YOU

211
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:14,032
AND YOUR FRIENDS.

212
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:15,567
WHEN YOU STAND UP AND CHEER,

213
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:16,968
"WAY TO GO," I FIGURE YOU LIKE

214
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:17,969
THAT SORT OF THING.

215
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:18,937
>> WELL, IT'S A COMMITMENT TO--

216
00:07:18,937 --> 00:07:19,805
YOU KNOW, TO YOUR TEAM.

217
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:20,605
YOU KNOW, YOU EITHER SUPPORT

218
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:21,473
YOUR TEAM, OR YOU DON'T SUPPORT

219
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:22,140
YOUR TEAM.

220
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:22,974
>> YEAH, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHICH

221
00:07:22,974 --> 00:07:23,709
TEAM YOU LIKE.

222
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:24,609
YOU LIKE THE TEAM THAT SEEMS TO

223
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:26,144
BE STRONGER, AND THAT'S SORT OF

224
00:07:26,144 --> 00:07:26,945
A GLADIATOR APPROACH...

225
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:27,646
>> WELL...

226
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:28,313
>> TO SPORT.

227
00:07:28,313 --> 00:07:30,048
>> THERE'S A BULLETIN, HUH?

228
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:31,483
I LIKE THE TEAM THAT'S STRONGER.

229
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:32,484
WELL, YOU THINK I LIKE A LOSER?

230
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:33,752
>> NO, I WOULDN'T SAY YOU LIKE

231
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:34,419
LOSERS, BUT...

232
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:35,087
>> YEAH.

233
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,421
>> SOMETIMES YOU LIKE THE GUY

234
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:37,723
WHO GETS HIT INTO THE BOARDS,

235
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:38,557
AND HE'S THE LOSER.

236
00:07:38,557 --> 00:07:39,224
SO LIKE--

237
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:40,025
>> I DON'T LIKE HIM.

238
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:41,193
I DON'T--NO.

239
00:07:41,193 --> 00:07:42,127
NO, I DON'T LIKE HIM.

240
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:44,329
I THINK THAT IT'S A--YOU HAVE TO

241
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:45,197
MAKE A COMMITMENT TO A SPORT.

242
00:07:45,197 --> 00:07:45,931
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE IN THERE

243
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:46,598
AND THEY'RE FIGHTING.

244
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:47,265
IT'S WAR.

245
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:48,333
THAT'S NOT A SPORT. THAT'S WAR.

246
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,167
>> HOW DO YOU PRACTICE A SPORT

247
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:49,835
LIKE THAT?

248
00:07:49,835 --> 00:07:50,702
YOU JUST KIND OF SKATE INTO THE

249
00:07:50,702 --> 00:07:51,369
BOARDS?

250
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:52,404
>> YEAH, WELL, YOU START WITH

251
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:54,272
YOUR OWN FAMILY, FIRST OF ALL.

252
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:56,007
>> OH, START SMALL.

253
00:07:56,007 --> 00:07:56,875
>> YEAH.

254
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:57,876
COME ON, I'LL SHOW YOU.

255
00:07:57,876 --> 00:07:58,577
>> ALL RIGHT.

256
00:07:58,577 --> 00:07:59,244
>> I THINK YOU BETTER

257
00:07:59,244 --> 00:08:00,445
TAKE YOUR GLASSES OFF.

258
00:08:00,445 --> 00:08:02,481
>> OH, THANKS.

259
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:08,920
>> IT IS WINTER.

260
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,522
A FRIEND HITS YOU IN THE FACE

261
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:12,157
WITH A SNOWBALL.

262
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:13,558
AND AS IT MELTS, YOU BECOME

263
00:08:13,558 --> 00:08:16,228
AWARE THAT HE HAS A NEW PUPPY.

264
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,065
SO AS I WAS SAYING, WE HAD THIS

265
00:08:20,065 --> 00:08:22,534
HE-MAN CONTEST, AND IT'S KIND OF

266
00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:23,301
INTERESTING HOW WE PUT IT

267
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:24,302
TOGETHER.

268
00:08:24,302 --> 00:08:26,238
WE MADE EACH GUY COME UP WITH AN

269
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:28,473
EVENT, AND THEN THE RULE BEING

270
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:30,008
THAT HE HAD TO GO FIRST ON HIS

271
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:31,476
OWN EVENT, AND THAT WAY THE GUYS

272
00:08:31,476 --> 00:08:32,510
WOULDN'T, YOU KNOW, RIG UP THE

273
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,079
EQUIPMENT SO THAT IT WOULD FALL

274
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:36,047
APART, AND THEN EVERYBODY ELSE

275
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:37,115
WOULD GET KILLED JUST SO THEY'D

276
00:08:37,115 --> 00:08:38,650
WIN.

277
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,352
>> UNCLE RED, YOU KNOW, THIS IS

278
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:42,120
A REALLY INTERESTING STORY,

279
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,622
IT REALLY IS, BUT SOME VIEWERS

280
00:08:43,622 --> 00:08:44,956
MIGHT FIND IT BORING,

281
00:08:44,956 --> 00:08:45,790
UNLESS, OF COURSE,

282
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,692
THEY FIND IT OFFENSIVE,

283
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:48,360
YOU KNOW.

284
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,194
AND THAT'S NOT BETTER.

285
00:08:49,194 --> 00:08:50,161
SO WHY DON'T WE JUST TELL THEM,

286
00:08:50,161 --> 00:08:50,996
YOU KNOW, THAT THERE WERE SOME

287
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:52,130
WINNERS AND SOME LOSERS AND SOME

288
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,865
INJURIES, AND THAT WAY, WE CAN

289
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:54,699
JUST GET RIGHT ALONG WITH THE

290
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:56,801
NEXT FILM CLIP.

291
00:08:56,801 --> 00:08:57,902
>> YEAH, BUT I THINK THE VIEWERS

292
00:08:57,902 --> 00:08:58,870
WOULD AT LEAST LIKE TO HEAR WHAT

293
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,038
THE EVENTS WERE, HAROLD.

294
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:00,839
>> OH, YEAH, OKAY.

295
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,908
YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

296
00:09:05,844 --> 00:09:07,078
>> WELL, I DIDN'T GET TO TELL

297
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:08,880
THEM WHAT THE EVENTS WERE.

298
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,881
>> OH, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU MEANT

299
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:11,149
RIGHT NOW.

300
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:12,217
>> WELL, WHEN DID YOU THINK I

301
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:13,351
MEANT, HAROLD?

302
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:15,754
>> EVENTUALLY.

303
00:09:19,057 --> 00:09:20,625
>> WELL, NOW, HAP, THIS IS

304
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:21,292
A GREAT DAY FOR FISHING.

305
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:21,993
IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER

306
00:09:21,993 --> 00:09:22,961
THAN THIS.

307
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:24,596
>> PERFECT WEATHER CONDITIONS,

308
00:09:24,596 --> 00:09:26,331
AS WE BUSH PILOTS USED TO CALL

309
00:09:26,331 --> 00:09:26,998
THEM.

310
00:09:26,998 --> 00:09:27,899
>> BUSH PILOT?

311
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,434
YOU WERE A BUSH PILOT?

312
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:30,602
>> OH, YEAH, I WAS ONE OF THE

313
00:09:30,602 --> 00:09:33,204
VERY BEST, SO THEY TELL ME.

314
00:09:33,204 --> 00:09:34,005
>> WHAT KIND OF PLANE

315
00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:35,006
DID YOU HAVE?

316
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:36,174
>> I WASN'T A PLANE PILOT.

317
00:09:36,174 --> 00:09:37,675
I WAS A BUSH PILOT.

318
00:09:37,675 --> 00:09:40,245
I PILOTED BUSHES.

319
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:43,181
>> WELL, BUSHES DON'T FLY, HAP.

320
00:09:43,181 --> 00:09:43,948
>> YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO TELL ME

321
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:44,616
THAT, RED.

322
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:45,283
I WORKED WITH THEM

323
00:09:45,283 --> 00:09:46,851
FOR FIVE YEARS.

324
00:09:46,851 --> 00:09:48,186
IN THE LUMBER COMPANY,

325
00:09:48,186 --> 00:09:49,287
BRITISH COLUMBIA.

326
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:50,722
THEY'D CUT DOWN THE TREES AND

327
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:51,790
DRAG THEM DOWN TO THE RIVER.

328
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,726
I'D BUILD A RAFT OUT OF A BUSH,

329
00:09:54,726 --> 00:09:55,960
AND I'D PILOT THOSE TREES DOWN

330
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,695
THE RIVER TO THE SAWMILL.

331
00:09:57,695 --> 00:10:00,932
>> OH, SO YOU WERE A LUMBERJACK.

332
00:10:00,932 --> 00:10:02,267
>> IT WAS DANGEROUS WORK BEING

333
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:04,102
A BUSH PILOT,

334
00:10:04,102 --> 00:10:05,637
FLOATING DOWN A RAGING RIVER ON

335
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:07,105
A SHRUB.

336
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:09,274
AND I GOT MY LOGS DOWN TO THE

337
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:11,409
MILL INTACT AND DEBARKED

338
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:13,044
AND READY TO SAW.

339
00:10:13,044 --> 00:10:14,179

00:14:43,647 --> 00:14:44,515
AND I WAS JUST KIBITZING HERE.

509
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:45,382
I THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE HURT HIS

510
00:14:45,382 --> 00:14:48,485
HEAD, SO I PUT SOME ICE ON IT.

511
00:14:48,485 --> 00:14:50,087
AND THEN WHAT HE WANTS TO DO IS,

512
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:51,789
HE'S GONNA USE A CHAINSAW TO

513
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:54,458
CUT--WELL, TO CUT THE SNOW.

514
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,160
OH! OH, MY GOD!

515
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,696
NOW HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA.

516
00:14:58,696 --> 00:14:59,496
THIS IS A PIZZA CUTTER.

517
00:14:59,496 --> 00:15:00,464
YEAH, YEAH.

518
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:01,365
SEE, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU

519
00:15:01,365 --> 00:15:02,032
USE.

520
00:15:02,032 --> 00:15:03,233
ONCE YOU GOT THE SNOW FROZEN SO

521
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:05,502
THAT IT'S GOT SOME TEXTURE TO IT

522
00:15:05,502 --> 00:15:07,838
SO IT'LL STAY TOGETHER, HE GOES

523
00:15:07,838 --> 00:15:09,640
AROUND, CUTTING IT INTO

524
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,041
A RECTANGLE.

525
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,276
NOW, HAVE YOU GUESSED THE LOST

526
00:15:12,276 --> 00:15:13,477
ART YET, BY THE WAY?

527
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:16,013
IT'S GONNA GET EASIER, I THINK.

528
00:15:16,013 --> 00:15:16,747
WELL, MAYBE NOT.

529
00:15:16,747 --> 00:15:17,414
MAYBE NOT.

530
00:15:17,414 --> 00:15:18,415
MAYBE NOT.

531
00:15:18,415 --> 00:15:21,485
AND HE COMPLETES THE RECTANGLE

532
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:23,353
NOW, AND THEN HE JUST GINGERLY,

533
00:15:23,353 --> 00:15:24,087
VERY--CAREFUL NOW, BILL.

534
00:15:24,087 --> 00:15:24,888
CAREFUL, CAREFUL, CAREFUL,

535
00:15:24,888 --> 00:15:26,156
CAREFUL.

536
00:15:26,156 --> 00:15:26,824
PICKS IT UP.

537
00:15:26,824 --> 00:15:27,658
YEAH, YEAH.

538
00:15:27,658 --> 00:15:29,660
PICKS IT UP.

539
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,928
AND THEN, AS I SAY, THIS IS

540
00:15:30,928 --> 00:15:31,862
A--I'LL GIVE YOU ANOTHER HINT.

541
00:15:31,862 --> 00:15:34,064
THIS--YOU SEE THIS MAINLY UP IN

542
00:15:34,064 --> 00:15:35,199
THE ARCTIC, YOU KNOW, WITH THE

543
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,533
INUIT AND THE ESKIMO, AND THEN

544
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:37,901
THEY GET INTO IT.

545
00:15:37,901 --> 00:15:40,504
YOU KNOW, THE INUIT GET INTO IT.

546
00:15:40,504 --> 00:15:42,239
NOW THIS--CAREFUL NOW.

547
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:42,906
NOW, SEE.

548
00:15:42,906 --> 00:15:43,841
WELL, HE WASN'T QUITE AS CAREFUL

549
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:44,508
WITH THAT.

550
00:15:44,508 --> 00:15:46,410
AND BILL IS NOT REALLY AS

551
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,512
PATIENT AS HE NEEDS TO BE.

552
00:15:48,512 --> 00:15:49,379
HAS ANYONE GUESSED WHAT HE'S

553
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:50,514
DOING?

554
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:51,815
HE'S BUILT HIMSELF A HOUSE.

555
00:15:51,815 --> 00:15:52,783
ISN'T THAT A BEAUTY?

556
00:15:52,783 --> 00:15:54,751
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S NOT IT.

557
00:15:54,751 --> 00:15:56,486
IT'S OVER THIS WAY.

558
00:15:56,486 --> 00:15:58,855
AND YEAH, THERE IT IS.

559
00:15:58,855 --> 00:15:59,623
NOT BAD.

560
00:15:59,623 --> 00:16:01,358
NO, NOT BAD.

561
00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:02,292
I THINK HE SHOULD HAVE

562
00:16:02,292 --> 00:16:03,660
DOVETAILED THE CORNERS, BUT IT'S

563
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,328
A BEAUTY.

564
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:05,529
AND OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, WE

565
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:06,563
DIDN'T REALLY NOTICE THE WIND

566
00:16:06,563 --> 00:16:09,366
COMING UP...

567
00:16:09,366 --> 00:16:12,035
WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE.

568
00:16:12,035 --> 00:16:13,637
IT IS WINTER.

569
00:16:13,637 --> 00:16:15,305
MY WIFE SNUGGLES CLOSE.

570
00:16:15,305 --> 00:16:16,807
"PUT A LOG ON THE FIRE,"

571
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:18,508
SHE WHISPERS.

572
00:16:18,508 --> 00:16:19,509
I DO.

573
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:21,244
IT SIZZLES AND POPS.

574
00:16:21,244 --> 00:16:22,079
IT CRACKLES

575
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,947
AND SNAPS AND FIZZLES.

576
00:16:23,947 --> 00:16:25,315
IT SHAKES AND YELPS

577
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:27,417
AND RUNS AWAY, WHIMPERING.

578
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:28,418
LOG?

579
00:16:28,418 --> 00:16:30,587
I THOUGHT SHE SAID "DOG."

580
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:45,469
EARLY ON IN THE PLANNING STAGES

581
00:16:45,469 --> 00:16:47,437
OF OUR SHOW, IT WAS SUGGESTED

582
00:16:47,437 --> 00:16:48,538
THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING

583
00:16:48,538 --> 00:16:49,439
DIFFERENT, SOME KIND OF

584
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:50,574
A FEATURE, YOU KNOW, JUST AS

585
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:51,541
LONG AS IT WAS UNIQUE.

586
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:52,576
IT DIDN'T MATTER IF IT WASN'T

587
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:55,312
ANY GOOD.

588
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,316
>> OKAY, SHOPPING WITH YOUR MOM.

589
00:16:59,316 --> 00:17:01,151
OH, YES, I REALIZE THIS ISN'T UP

590
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:02,686
THERE, LIKE, WITH WORLD HUNGER

591
00:17:02,686 --> 00:17:03,887
OR PEACE OR, YOU KNOW, WHO'S

592
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:05,822
BETTER, GRETZKY OR LEMIEUX?

593
00:17:05,822 --> 00:17:08,625
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME.

594
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:09,726
NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO GO

595
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:10,927
SHOPPING WITH THEIR MOM,

596
00:17:10,927 --> 00:17:12,429
ESPECIALLY SINCE I KNEW THE

597
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:14,664
SALES GIRL FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

598
00:17:14,664 --> 00:17:16,133
SHE HAD TO MEASURE ME, AND MOM

599
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:17,634
KEPT SAYING, "HE WEARS SMALL

600
00:17:17,634 --> 00:17:18,602
PANTS."

601
00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:20,303
[squawking]

602
00:17:20,303 --> 00:17:22,038
THAT KILLED.

603
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:23,206
I DON'T BLAME THE SALES GIRL FOR

604
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:27,911
LAUGHING, BUT FOR 15 MINUTES?

605
00:17:27,911 --> 00:17:29,513
THERE SHOULD BE A LAW, YOU KNOW.

606
00:17:29,513 --> 00:17:31,381
THERE SHOULD BE, LIKE, SOME

607
00:17:31,381 --> 00:17:32,782
RESPECT FOR PRIVACY.

608
00:17:32,782 --> 00:17:33,550
AND THERE SHOULD BE A LOCK ON

609
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,851
THOSE CHANGING ROOM DOORS SO THE

610
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:35,919
DOOR DOESN'T BUST OPEN WHEN YOU

611
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,155
BEND OVER TO PICK YOUR PANTS UP.

612
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:40,323
I DON'T CARE HOW RIDICULOUS THAT

613
00:17:40,323 --> 00:17:41,157
POINT OF VIEW IS.

614
00:17:41,157 --> 00:17:44,027
IT'S MINE.

615
00:17:44,027 --> 00:17:46,863
THANK YOU.

616
00:17:46,863 --> 00:17:47,998
>> WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH LOTS

617
00:17:47,998 --> 00:17:49,699
MORE FUN AND LOTS MORE GUESTS

618
00:17:49,699 --> 00:17:51,001
AND THE EXCITING CONCLUSION OF

619
00:17:51,001 --> 00:17:52,802
THE HE-MAN CONTEST STORY.

620
00:17:52,802 --> 00:17:53,870
>> THERE'S A CHANCE HE COULD BE

621
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,106
EXAGGERATING.

622
00:18:07,584 --> 00:18:08,285
>> HAROLD, I'LL TELL YOU

623
00:18:08,285 --> 00:18:08,952
SOMETHING.

624
00:18:08,952 --> 00:18:10,954
THE WORLD IS IN TROUBLE BECAUSE

625
00:18:10,954 --> 00:18:12,289
WE GOT TOO MANY PEOPLE THAT GOT

626
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:14,057
A UNIVERSITY DEGREE, AND THEY

627
00:18:14,057 --> 00:18:15,425
DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT LIFE.

628
00:18:15,425 --> 00:18:16,626
>> THAT'S TRUE.

629
00:18:16,626 --> 00:18:17,327
>> YEAH.

630
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:18,261
SPEND TOO MUCH TIME IN SCHOOL.

631
00:18:18,261 --> 00:18:19,129
DON'T STAY IN SCHOOL TOO MUCH,

632
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:20,430
HAROLD.

633
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,364
>> BUT THEN I'D HAVE

634
00:18:21,364 --> 00:18:22,032
NO PLACE TO GO.

635
00:18:22,032 --> 00:18:22,799
>> YOU LEARN HOW TO READ, YOU

636
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:23,633
LEARN HOW TO WRITE, YOU LEARN

637
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:25,935
HOW TO COUNT UP TO, SAY, 11,

638
00:18:25,935 --> 00:18:27,404
AND THAT'S ENOUGH.

639
00:18:27,404 --> 00:18:28,138
>> BUT THAT'S NOT EVEN UP TO

640
00:18:28,138 --> 00:18:28,805
A DOZEN.

641
00:18:28,805 --> 00:18:29,572
YOU GOT TO BE ABLE TO COUNT TO

642
00:18:29,572 --> 00:18:30,674
12 'CAUSE THAT'S A DOZEN.

643
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:31,508
YOU GOT TO KNOW HOW MANY WORMS

644
00:18:31,508 --> 00:18:33,243
YOU GOT IN YOUR BAIT BOX.

645
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:34,411
>> EAT ONE.

646
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:35,378
>> THAT'S TRUE.

647
00:18:35,378 --> 00:18:37,347
BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THE TEACHERS?

648
00:18:37,347 --> 00:18:38,148
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE JOBS OR

649
00:18:38,148 --> 00:18:39,082
NOTHING OR LIKE THAT.

650
00:18:39,082 --> 00:18:40,383
>> WELL, THEY'D HAVE TO FIND,

651
00:18:40,383 --> 00:18:41,284
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE

652
00:18:41,284 --> 00:18:42,285
TO DO.

653
00:18:42,285 --> 00:18:42,986
>> THAT'S TRUE.

654
00:18:42,986 --> 00:18:44,554
THEY'D HAVE TO GO ACTUALLY GO

655
00:18:44,554 --> 00:18:45,755
INTO THE WORLD THAT THEY'RE

656
00:18:45,755 --> 00:18:46,423
TALKING ABOUT.

657
00:18:46,423 --> 00:18:47,223
>> WELL, NOW, THERE'S

658
00:18:47,223 --> 00:18:48,124
A STATEMENT, ISN'T IT, EH?

659
00:18:48,124 --> 00:18:49,692
>> UH-OH, I MADE A STATEMENT.

660
00:18:49,692 --> 00:18:50,493
>> YEAH.

661
00:18:50,493 --> 00:18:51,161
>> BUT SEE, I CAN MAKE

662
00:18:51,161 --> 00:18:51,995
STATEMENTS 'CAUSE I WENT TO

663
00:18:51,995 --> 00:18:52,662
SCHOOL.

664
00:18:52,662 --> 00:18:53,363
I KNOW HOW.

665
00:18:53,363 --> 00:18:54,731
>> WELL, STATEMENTS ARE WORTH

666
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:55,765
YOU KNOW WHAT.

667
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:57,734
SQUAT.

668
00:18:57,734 --> 00:18:58,802
>> SQUAT STATEMENTS?

669
00:18:58,802 --> 00:19:00,770
LIKE, THEY'RE LITTLE ONES?

670
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:01,571
>> WELL, YEAH, BUT THEY GET TO

671
00:19:01,571 --> 00:19:02,439
THE POINT.

672
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:03,706
AND THE THING I HEAR IS THAT YOU

673
00:19:03,706 --> 00:19:04,707
TAKE ONE OF YOUR TEACHERS AND

674
00:19:04,707 --> 00:19:05,575
YOU PUT THEM UP HERE IN THE

675
00:19:05,575 --> 00:19:06,376
LODGE, AND HOW LONG ARE THEY

676
00:19:06,376 --> 00:19:07,210
GONNA LAST?

677
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,978
>> A WEEK?

678
00:19:08,978 --> 00:19:11,514
>> I HAVE NO IDEA.

679
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:15,585
JACK, JACK, COME ON UP HERE.

680
00:19:15,585 --> 00:19:18,121
I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE, JACK.

681
00:19:22,325 --> 00:19:23,026
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT?

682
00:19:23,026 --> 00:19:23,827
>> OH, NOTHING.

683
00:19:23,827 --> 00:19:24,694
I JUST, YOU KNOW, WANTED TO SEE

684
00:19:24,694 --> 00:19:25,461
HOW YOU WERE DOING.

685
00:19:25,461 --> 00:19:26,462
THAT'S ALL.

686
00:19:26,462 --> 00:19:27,831
>> HOW DO YOU MEAN?

687
00:19:27,831 --> 00:19:29,098
>> WELL, I WAS JUST WONDERING

688
00:19:29,098 --> 00:19:30,700
HOW YOU'RE ADJUSTING, JACK, YOU

689
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,569
KNOW, TO GO FROM BEING AN

690
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:34,204
EXECUTIVE AND A FAMILY MAN TO

691
00:19:34,204 --> 00:19:36,072
BEING A PARANOID CAVE-DWELLING

692
00:19:36,072 --> 00:19:37,707
HERMIT.

693
00:19:37,707 --> 00:19:39,375
>> MY WIFE SENT YOU, DIDN'T SHE?

694
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,277
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, MAN.

695
00:19:41,277 --> 00:19:42,412
I KNOW PEOPLE ARE LAUGHING AT

696
00:19:42,412 --> 00:19:43,913
ME, A LOT OF PEOPLE, BUT THEY

697
00:19:43,913 --> 00:19:45,048
LAUGHED AT CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS

698
00:19:45,048 --> 00:19:46,049
TOO.

699
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:46,950
AND IF IT WASN'T FOR HIM, WE'D

700
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,217
ALL BE ITALIAN.

701
00:19:48,217 --> 00:19:49,752
SO I DON'T MIND THAT PEOPLE ARE

702
00:19:49,752 --> 00:19:50,920
LAUGHING AT ME BECAUSE THEY

703
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,722
LAUGHED AT COLUMBUS.

704
00:19:52,722 --> 00:19:55,425
>> DID THEY?

705
00:19:55,425 --> 00:19:56,826
>> DIDN'T THEY?

706
00:19:56,826 --> 00:19:57,860
>> I HAVE NO IDEA.

707
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,530
>> I MEAN, I'M SURE SOME SMUG

708
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,597
JERK DID.

709
00:20:01,597 --> 00:20:02,398
THEY'RE ALWAYS LAUGHING.

710
00:20:02,398 --> 00:20:03,166
YOU KNOW, THEY LAUGHED AT ME

711
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,000
WHEN I CAME UP HERE.

712
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,667
>> YEAH.

713
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:05,435
>> THEY LAUGHED AT ME WHEN I

714
00:20:05,435 --> 00:20:06,469
WENT INTO ADVERTISING AFTER

715
00:20:06,469 --> 00:20:07,270
COLLEGE.

716
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,504
THEY LAUGHED AT ME WHEN I PLAYED

717
00:20:08,504 --> 00:20:10,606
FIELD HOCKEY IN HIGH SCHOOL.

718
00:20:10,606 --> 00:20:12,442
THAT'S THEIR PROBLEM NOW.

719
00:20:12,442 --> 00:20:14,210
>> YEAH, WELL, I GUESS WHAT

720
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,244
YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT YOU'RE NOT

721
00:20:15,244 --> 00:20:16,679
JUST KIND OF SKULKING AROUND IN

722
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:18,448
YOUR CAVE FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR

723
00:20:18,448 --> 00:20:19,248
HEALTH, EH?

724
00:20:19,248 --> 00:20:20,016
HUH?

725
00:20:20,016 --> 00:20:21,784
>> I AM NOT SKULKING, RED.

726
00:20:21,784 --> 00:20:22,518
>> OH, ALL RIGHT.

727
00:20:22,518 --> 00:20:24,721
>> I STAND TALL, EXCEPT DOWN

728
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:27,790
RIGHT AT THE BACK IT'S VERY LOW,

729
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,593
THE ROOF, AND THAT'S MY TV ROOM.

730
00:20:30,593 --> 00:20:31,361
BUT OTHER THAN THAT, I DON'T

731
00:20:31,361 --> 00:20:32,729
SKULK ANYWHERE.

732
00:20:32,729 --> 00:20:33,730
>> ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,

733
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:34,831
NO SKULKING.

734
00:20:34,831 --> 00:20:36,599
JACK, THE GUYS AT THE LODGE WERE

735
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:39,435
WANTING TO KNOW HOW LONG EXACTLY

736
00:20:39,435 --> 00:20:41,304
YOU PLAN ON BEING UP HERE.

737
00:20:41,304 --> 00:20:43,106
>> WELL, BASICALLY, UNTIL THE

738
00:20:43,106 --> 00:20:45,241
RELIGIOUS FANATICS AND

739
00:20:45,241 --> 00:20:46,509
WARMONGERING DICTATORS HAVE

740
00:20:46,509 --> 00:20:47,877
DESTROYED THE WORLD.

741
00:20:47,877 --> 00:20:49,445
SEE, THEN I'LL COME DOWN FROM MY

742
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:51,881
HOLE IN THE HILL AND BE KING OF

743
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:52,882
ALL I SURVEY.

744
00:20:52,882 --> 00:20:53,616
>> OH.

745
00:20:53,616 --> 00:20:54,851
>> YEAH, AND THEN I'LL JUST KIND

746
00:20:54,851 --> 00:20:56,119
OF WING IT FROM THERE, DEPENDING

747
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:57,320
ON WHAT I SURVEY.

748
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,387
>> YEAH, YEAH.

749
00:20:58,387 --> 00:20:59,489
>> I'LL TELL YOU, THOUGH, IF THE

750
00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:01,524
CITIES ARE STILL IN GOOD SHAPE,

751
00:21:01,524 --> 00:21:03,526
I THINK I'M GONNA TURN THEM INTO

752
00:21:03,526 --> 00:21:04,427
A THEME PARK.

753
00:21:04,427 --> 00:21:06,829
>> OH, WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE

754
00:21:06,829 --> 00:21:07,964
YOU'RE GONNA BE UP HERE FOR

755
00:21:07,964 --> 00:21:10,566
A LONG, LONG WHILE.

756
00:21:10,566 --> 00:21:12,702
>> WELL, I HOPE NOT.

757
00:21:12,702 --> 00:21:13,536
I ONLY HAVE ENOUGH FOOD FOR SIX

758
00:21:13,536 --> 00:21:15,304
WEEKS.

759
00:21:15,304 --> 00:21:16,372
YOU KNOW, CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS,

760
00:21:16,372 --> 00:21:17,406
HE DIDN'T HAVE THESE PROBLEMS.

761
00:21:17,406 --> 00:21:19,375
THE QUEEN GAVE HIM MONEY.

762
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,810
OLD JACK'S DOING THIS

763
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,612
ON HIS OWN.

764
00:21:22,612 --> 00:21:23,980
>> WELL, IF IT WOULD HELP YOU, I

765
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,815
COULD LEND YOU, LIKE, 20 BUCKS

766
00:21:25,815 --> 00:21:27,216
OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW.

767
00:21:27,216 --> 00:21:29,285
>> I'M SORRY, RED, BUT I NO

768
00:21:29,285 --> 00:21:31,220
LONGER RECOGNIZE YOUR CURRENCY.

769
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,955
IT'S MEANINGLESS PAPER,

770
00:21:32,955 --> 00:21:34,257
YOU KNOW, A USELESS SYMBOL

771
00:21:34,257 --> 00:21:36,292
OF A CIVILIZATION GONE AWRY.

772
00:21:36,292 --> 00:21:37,627
>> OH.

773
00:21:37,627 --> 00:21:39,195
WELL, I HAVE SOME MCDONALDS

774
00:21:39,195 --> 00:21:39,962
COUPONS.

775
00:21:39,962 --> 00:21:40,963
WHAT ABOUT THOSE?

776
00:21:40,963 --> 00:21:41,797
>> SURE.

777
00:21:41,797 --> 00:21:42,965
SURE, THOSE--

778
00:21:42,965 --> 00:21:45,568
>> HELP YOURSELF, EH?

779
00:21:45,568 --> 00:21:46,269
THERE YOU GO.

780
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:46,969
YEAH.

781
00:21:46,969 --> 00:21:47,637
>> THANKS.

782
00:21:47,637 --> 00:21:48,771
>> OKAY.

783
00:21:48,771 --> 00:21:51,540
>> NOW BUG OFF!

784
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,542
>> JACK, THOSE COUPONS

785
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:56,545
ARE FOR MCRIBS.

786
00:21:56,545 --> 00:21:58,514
>> DARN!

787
00:22:05,187 --> 00:22:06,589
>> ANYWAY, I JUST WANTED TO TELL

788
00:22:06,589 --> 00:22:08,290
YOU HOW THE HE-MAN CONTEST

789
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,425
WORKED OUT.

790
00:22:09,425 --> 00:22:10,292
IT WAS KIND OF FUN.

791
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:12,261
THE FIRST EVENT WAS OLD MAN

792
00:22:12,261 --> 00:22:13,796
SEDGEWICK'S TOOTH RACE.

793
00:22:13,796 --> 00:22:15,131
AND THE WAY THAT WORKED WAS,

794
00:22:15,131 --> 00:22:16,632
YOU HAD TO TAKE YOUR TEETH OUT,

795
00:22:16,632 --> 00:22:17,867
PUT THEM ON THE FLOOR, STAND ON

796
00:22:17,867 --> 00:22:19,335
THEM, PICK THEM UP, PUT THEM

797
00:22:19,335 --> 00:22:20,236
BACK IN YOUR MOUTH.

798
00:22:20,236 --> 00:22:21,971
AND ACTUALLY, OLD MAN SEDGEWICK

799
00:22:21,971 --> 00:22:23,839
WON THAT ONE, BUT THEN HE'S THE

800
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:25,574
ONLY ONE THAT HAS DENTURES.

801
00:22:25,574 --> 00:22:26,542
NOBODY EVEN CAME IN SECOND,

802
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:28,978
ALTHOUGH MOOSE THOMPSON MANAGED

803
00:22:28,978 --> 00:22:30,246
TO LOOSEN THREE MOLARS FOR AN

804
00:22:30,246 --> 00:22:32,214
HONORABLE MENTION.

805
00:22:32,214 --> 00:22:34,350
AND THEN BUSTER HATFIELD HAD THE

806
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,018
BEER CHUG-A-LUGGING CONTEST,

807
00:22:36,018 --> 00:22:38,154
WHICH WE ALL WON.

808
00:22:38,154 --> 00:22:39,321
THE LAKE WAS THE ONLY LOSER ON

809
00:22:39,321 --> 00:22:40,990
THAT ONE.

810
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,525
AND THEN WE GOT THE KIND OF

811
00:22:42,525 --> 00:22:43,793
INTERESTING EVENT, THE ONE I

812
00:22:43,793 --> 00:22:45,528
COME UP WITH, WHICH WAS 100-YARD

813
00:22:45,528 --> 00:22:47,696
DASH BACKWARDS THROUGH THE WOODS

814
00:22:47,696 --> 00:22:49,365
BLINDFOLDED.

815
00:22:49,365 --> 00:22:50,766
AND STINKY PETERSON WON THAT IN

816
00:22:50,766 --> 00:22:52,301
15 SECONDS FLAT.

817
00:22:52,301 --> 00:22:54,703
UNFORTUNATELY, WE LOST JUNIOR

818
00:22:54,703 --> 00:22:55,671
SINGLETON FOR THE REST OF THE

819
00:22:55,671 --> 00:22:57,173
GAMES.

820
00:22:57,173 --> 00:22:58,507
BUT THAT WAS A HECK OF A DAY.

821
00:22:58,507 --> 00:23:01,210
WE ALL HAD A REAL GOOD TIME, AND

822
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,244
IT WORKED OUT WELL.

823
00:23:02,244 --> 00:23:03,145
I MEAN, JUNIOR SINGLETON IS

824
00:23:03,145 --> 00:23:05,414
ACTUALLY STILL GETTING SOME

825
00:23:05,414 --> 00:23:06,115
FRESH AIR.

826
00:23:06,115 --> 00:23:07,716
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE AT NIGHT,

827
00:23:07,716 --> 00:23:09,451
WE KIND OF HEAR HIM GO BY THE

828
00:23:09,451 --> 00:23:10,819
LODGE.

829
00:23:10,819 --> 00:23:11,887
THAT BLINDFOLD'S ON TIGHT, I'LL

830
00:23:11,887 --> 00:23:12,655
TELL YOU.

831
00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:13,989
ANYWAY, THAT'S ABOUT IT

832
00:23:13,989 --> 00:23:14,690
FOR THIS WEEK.

833
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:15,691
SO IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

834
00:23:15,691 --> 00:23:16,692
I'LL BE HOME SOON.

835
00:23:16,692 --> 00:23:18,561
AND IF JUNIOR SINGLETON'S WIFE

836
00:23:18,561 --> 00:23:21,564
IS WATCHING, HE'S GONNA BE LATE.

837
00:23:21,564 --> 00:23:23,699
OKAY, SO UNTIL NEXT TIME,

838
00:23:23,699 --> 00:23:26,268
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND--

839
00:23:26,268 --> 00:23:27,136
>> HAROLD.

840
00:23:27,136 --> 00:23:29,371
>> YEAH, WHATEVER, AND THE REST

841
00:23:29,371 --> 00:23:30,773
OF THE GUYS UP AT THE LODGE,

842
00:23:30,773 --> 00:23:33,108
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.
