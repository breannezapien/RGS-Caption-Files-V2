00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,114
ANYWAY, HERE'S THE FIRST LETTER.

343
00:10:50,114 --> 00:10:51,983
THIS IS THE INTERNATIONAL ONE,

344
00:10:51,983 --> 00:10:54,519
"DEAR OH CUPANT."

345
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,687
THAT'S FRENCH.

346
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:58,890
>> THAT'S OCCUPANT.

347
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,124
>> OH, YEAH.

348
00:11:00,124 --> 00:11:01,025
OKAY.

349
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:02,327
WELL--WELL, THE CONTENT'S STILL

350
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:03,695
INTERNATIONAL--IS SO.

351
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:05,229
ANYWAY, HE GOES, "HOW MUCH WOULD

352
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:07,131
YOU GIVE FOR A WORLD FREE OF

353
00:11:07,131 --> 00:11:10,234
WAR, FEAR, HUNGER, AND WANT?"

354
00:11:10,234 --> 00:11:11,936
>> 280 BUCKS.

355
00:11:11,936 --> 00:11:12,804
>> THAT'S FAIR.

356
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:14,238
THAT'S--THAT'S MORE THAN FAIR.

357
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:15,306
VERY FAIR.

358
00:11:15,306 --> 00:11:16,574
>> OKAY, NEXT LETTER.

359
00:11:16,574 --> 00:11:17,809
THIS IS THE CELEBRITY ONE.

360
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:18,609
GET THIS.

361
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:19,277
GET THIS.

362
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:20,211
IT'S FROM ED MCMAHON.

363
00:11:20,211 --> 00:11:21,612
YOU KNOW EVERYBODY, UNCLE RED.

364
00:11:21,612 --> 00:11:22,280
THAT'S SO GREAT.

365
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,181
ED MCMAHON, YOU KNOW HIM.

366
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:24,148
THIS IS GREAT.

367
00:11:24,148 --> 00:11:25,283
A PERSONALIZED LETTER TO YOU.

368
00:11:25,283 --> 00:11:26,317
[chuckles]

369
00:11:26,317 --> 00:11:27,518
"DEAR MR. GREEN.

370
00:11:27,518 --> 00:11:30,288
YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY WON

371
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:32,990
$1 MILLION CASH, TAX FREE."

372
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,025
OH, EXCELLENT.

373
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:35,193
YOU'RE A MILLIONAIRE.

374
00:11:35,193 --> 00:11:36,594
OH, THAT'S EX--THAT IS SO

375
00:11:36,594 --> 00:11:37,395
FANTASTIC.

376
00:11:37,395 --> 00:11:38,396
THIS IS GREAT.

377
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:39,931
ED GOES ON TO SAY, "WOULD YOU BE

378
00:11:39,931 --> 00:11:40,965
INTERESTED IN RECEIVING

379
00:11:40,965 --> 00:11:42,033
MAGAZINES AT A TREMENDOUS

380
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:44,068
DISCOUNT?"

381
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:45,136
>> WHY, HAROLD, I THINK YOU'RE

382
00:11:45,136 --> 00:11:46,037
GONNA HAVE TO TELL ED THAT NOW

383
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:48,439
THAT I'M A MILLIONAIRE, I WANT

384
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:49,774
TO PAY FULL PRICE.

385
00:11:49,774 --> 00:11:51,008
SO I'M NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN

386
00:11:51,008 --> 00:11:52,977
THE MAGAZINES.

387
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:54,011
IN FACT, I MIGHT BE WILLING TO

388
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:55,580
GO UP TO, SAY, 500 BUCKS TO PUT

389
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,216
AN END TO WORLD FEAR, HUNGER,

390
00:11:58,216 --> 00:11:59,016
AND WANT.

391
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:00,284
>> THAT IS EXCELLENT.

392
00:12:00,284 --> 00:12:01,419
THAT IS FANTASTIC.

393
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:02,286
YOU MILLIONAIRES SURE KNOW HOW

394
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:02,954
TO LIVE.

395
00:12:02,954 --> 00:12:03,654
>> RIGHT.

396
00:12:03,654 --> 00:12:04,488
>> [laughs]

397
00:12:04,488 --> 00:12:05,990
UNCLE RED, NOW THAT YOU ARE A

398
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,825
MILLIONAIRE AND ALL, CAN I

399
00:12:07,825 --> 00:12:09,927
BORROW $2?

400
00:12:09,927 --> 00:12:10,928
>> WELL, OF COURSE YOU CAN,

401
00:12:10,928 --> 00:12:12,063
HAROLD.

402
00:12:12,063 --> 00:12:12,997
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT

403
00:12:12,997 --> 00:12:14,966
TILL ED'S CHECK CLEARS.

404
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:19,303
THOUGHT WE'D TRY SOMETHING

405
00:12:19,303 --> 00:12:20,338
KIND OF EXCITING THIS WEEK.

406
00:12:20,338 --> 00:12:21,606
THOUGHT BILL'D SHOW US HOW TO

407
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:23,574
GO SCUBA DIVING.

408
00:12:23,574 --> 00:12:24,775
SO HE BROUGHT ALL THE GEAR, AND

409
00:12:24,775 --> 00:12:25,910
WHAT HE WANTED TO SHOW ME WAS

410
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,944
THIS FANCY WATCH HE'S GOT

411
00:12:26,944 --> 00:12:28,613
WITH--IT SHOWS YOU YOUR DEPTH

412
00:12:28,613 --> 00:12:30,214
AND HOW MUCH TIME YOU GOT LEFT

413
00:12:30,214 --> 00:12:31,148
IN YOUR TANK.

414
00:12:31,148 --> 00:12:32,183
AND I DIDN'T REALLY WANT HIM TO

415
00:12:32,183 --> 00:12:33,351
TAKE IT OFF, YOU KNOW.

416
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:34,819
HE JUST--HE GETS IN AND

417
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:38,856
THIS--AND THAT'S WHY.

418
00:12:38,856 --> 00:12:40,024
AND THEN HE HAD THE OXYGEN TANK,

419
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:40,858
WANTED TO SHOW ME--

420
00:12:40,858 --> 00:12:43,694
>> OOH!

421
00:12:43,694 --> 00:12:45,663
>> OKAY, SO WE'RE NOT GOING WITH

422
00:12:45,663 --> 00:12:46,364
PLAN A.

423
00:12:46,364 --> 00:12:47,231
WE'RE GOIN' WITH PLAN B, WHICH

424
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,332
IS SNORKELING RATHER THAN SCUBA

425
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:49,133
DIVING.

426
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:50,334
BUT A LOT OF THE GEAR IS THE

427
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:52,903
SAME, THE MASK AND THIS LITTLE

428
00:12:52,903 --> 00:12:55,806
AIR HOSE DEAL, YOU KNOW.

429
00:12:55,806 --> 00:12:57,174
FIRST THING, YOU WANT TO GET A

430
00:12:57,174 --> 00:12:59,010
REAL GOOD SEAL BETWEEN YOUR SKIN

431
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,078
AND--AND THE MASK.

432
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:02,646
AND THEN YOU BEND THIS UP AND

433
00:13:02,646 --> 00:13:04,482
STICK IT--ONE END IN YOUR MOUTH.

434
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:05,249
AND THEN BILL'S SHOWING YOU

435
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:05,916
HERE.

436
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:06,751
THE AIR GOES IN HERE, AND THIS

437
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:08,285
IS UNFOR--HE WAS INHALING WHILE

438
00:13:08,285 --> 00:13:09,920
HE WAS--AND THEN IT GOT JAMMED

439
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,588
IN THERE, AND...

440
00:13:10,588 --> 00:13:11,655
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT BILL

441
00:13:11,655 --> 00:13:12,323
WAS HAVIN' A PROBLEM...

442
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:13,190
>> GET MY FINGER OUT OF THERE!

443
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,858
>> BREATHIN' THERE.

444
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:15,893
I WAS KIND OF--BUT I SAVED HIS

445
00:13:15,893 --> 00:13:18,929
LIFE, REALLY.

446
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:19,630
THERE YOU GO.

447
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,633
>> YIKES!

448
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:24,101
>> AH, HE'S OKAY.

449
00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:25,136
NOW HE PUTS THE--THE BIG

450
00:13:25,136 --> 00:13:26,003
FLIPPERS ON.

451
00:13:26,003 --> 00:13:26,937
NOW, I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE

452
00:13:26,937 --> 00:13:29,140
SO I--I'M JUST AN AMATEUR.

453
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,374
I JUST SAT DOWN, PUT THEM ON,

454
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:31,108
BUT APPARENTLY, THERE IS A

455
00:13:31,108 --> 00:13:31,976
TECHNIQUE WHERE YOU JUST--YOU

456
00:13:31,976 --> 00:13:33,577
JUST STEP INTO THEM LIKE BILL'S

457
00:13:33,577 --> 00:13:34,779
SHOWING YOU THERE.

458
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:36,814
BUT I GUESS, YOU KNOW, WITH ME

459
00:13:36,814 --> 00:13:38,482
NOT KNOWING, I WAS KIND OF

460
00:13:38,482 --> 00:13:40,184
MAKING A FOOL OUT OF MYSELF,

461
00:13:40,184 --> 00:13:42,386
BUT--AND I WASN'T GONNA WORRY

462
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:43,254
ABOUT THAT.

463
00:13:43,254 --> 00:13:44,955
YOU KNOW, BILL'S THE EXPERT.

464
00:13:44,955 --> 00:13:46,090
I NEVER CLAIMED TO--TO KNOW WHAT

465
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,625
I'M DOING, YOU KNOW?

466
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:52,363
AND THIS SEEMED UNUSUAL TO ME,

467
00:13:52,363 --> 00:13:54,265
BUT IT DIDN'T SEEM TO BOTHER

468
00:13:54,265 --> 00:13:57,134
BILL THAT MUCH, SO I GUESS HE'S

469
00:13:57,134 --> 00:13:59,136
JUST GONNA MAKE RIGHT-HAND

470
00:13:59,136 --> 00:13:59,803
TURNS.

471
00:13:59,803 --> 00:14:01,105
ANYWAY, THIS IS A DIVING CAGE,

472
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:02,706
AND THIS IS BILL IN A WETSUIT,

473
00:14:02,706 --> 00:14:03,574
WHICH YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE ON A

474
00:14:03,574 --> 00:14:04,375
FULL STOMACH.

475
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,310
AND IN HE GOES.

476
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:08,412
I THINK IT WAS BILL.

477
00:14:08,412 --> 00:14:09,213
HE SHOULD'VE MAYBE HAVE

478
00:14:09,213 --> 00:14:10,314
TIGHTENED THE MASK UP JUST A BIT

479
00:14:10,314 --> 00:14:12,283
THERE.

480
00:14:13,918 --> 00:14:14,785
BUT HE'S OKAY,

481
00:14:14,785 --> 00:14:15,719
SO HE DECIDES HE'S GONNA--THIS

482
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:17,087
TIME, INSTEAD OF JUMPING IN,

483
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,289
MAYBE CLIMB DOWN THE LADDER,

484
00:14:18,289 --> 00:14:19,256
WHICH IS TRICKY, BECAUSE YOU

485
00:14:19,256 --> 00:14:20,257
GOT--WELL, HE ONLY HAS THE ONE

486
00:14:20,257 --> 00:14:21,959
FLIPPER TO WORRY ABOUT, WHICH IS

487
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,727
AN ADVANTAGE I SUPPOSE.

488
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:27,398
BUT ALSO, YOU SHOULD REALLY

489
00:14:27,398 --> 00:14:28,866
CHECK HOW TIGHT THE BOLTS ARE,

490
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:29,833
YOU KNOW?

491
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,169
AND, YOU KNOW, HE JUST BLEW THE

492
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:33,337
WATER RIGHT OUT OF HIS TUBE INTO

493
00:14:33,337 --> 00:14:35,539
MY FACE, WHICH MADE MY DAY.

494
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:36,607
LOOK OUT, BILL.

495
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:38,142
AND THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

496
00:14:38,142 --> 00:14:39,743
HE FELT THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

497
00:14:39,743 --> 00:14:41,412
NOW THAT'S A DIVING CAGE.

498
00:14:41,412 --> 00:14:42,846
DOWN HE GOES, AND WHATEVER HE

499
00:14:42,846 --> 00:14:43,947
FINDS, HE PUTS IN THE CAGE.

500
00:14:43,947 --> 00:14:45,382
THEN HE PULLS ON THE ROPE, AND I

501
00:14:45,382 --> 00:14:46,283
HAUL IT UP.

502
00:14:46,283 --> 00:14:48,318
THAT'S THE IDEA OF IT.

503
00:14:48,318 --> 00:14:49,520
HE WAS DOWN THERE THE BETTER

504
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,357
PART OF--WELL, NOT MORE THAN

505
00:14:53,357 --> 00:14:54,525
FIVE HOURS I WOULDN'T THINK.

506
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:56,727
YOU KNOW, MAYBE.

507
00:14:56,727 --> 00:14:57,695
BUT THEN EVENTUALLY HE DID PULL

508
00:14:57,695 --> 00:14:59,163
ON--HE PULLED ON THE ROPE, AND I

509
00:14:59,163 --> 00:15:01,031
STARTED HAULING HIM UP.

510
00:15:01,031 --> 00:15:01,865
AND HE COMES UP, AND OF COURSE

511
00:15:01,865 --> 00:15:02,833
THE FIRST THING HE WANTS TO DO

512
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,935
IS TO--IS TO CLEAR OUT HIS TUBE

513
00:15:04,935 --> 00:15:07,638
AGAIN, YOU KNOW.

514
00:15:07,638 --> 00:15:09,339
THANK YOU, BILL.

515
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:10,874
IT'S REFRESHING BUT SCARY AT THE

516
00:15:10,874 --> 00:15:11,575
SAME TIME.

517
00:15:11,575 --> 00:15:12,476
ANYWAY, UP COMES--UP COMES--UP

518
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:14,745
COMES THE CAGE, AND LOOK WHAT

519
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:15,646
HE'S GOT HERE.

520
00:15:15,646 --> 00:15:18,081
FIRST DEAL HE'S GOT, HIS WATCH.

521
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:19,550
SO I MEAN, I WAS IMPRESSED BY

522
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,918
IT.

523
00:15:20,918 --> 00:15:21,885
AND HE HAD THE SCUBA TANK IN

524
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:23,053
THERE, AND THERE WAS THE LADDER,

525
00:15:23,053 --> 00:15:25,956
AND HE EVEN HAD THE FLIPPER.

526
00:15:25,956 --> 00:15:28,592
SO IT WAS A GREAT DAY, BUT HE

527
00:15:28,592 --> 00:15:29,359
DIDN'T DO A LOT FOR HIS UPPER

528
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:31,328

>> WELL, BOB, BUT THERE'S--

679
00:19:37,006 --> 00:19:37,840
THERE'S LIKE 40 GUYS IN

680
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,741
THE LODGE, YOU KNOW?

681
00:19:38,741 --> 00:19:40,343
>> NO PROBLEM.

682
00:19:40,343 --> 00:19:41,678
>> I KNOW, BUT I--THESE GUYS,

683
00:19:41,678 --> 00:19:42,779
WELL, THEY'RE NOT GOLFERS AT

684
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:43,613
HEART, EH?

685
00:19:43,613 --> 00:19:44,314
NOT LIKE YOU.

686
00:19:44,314 --> 00:19:45,048
>> OH, WELL, COME ON.

687
00:19:45,048 --> 00:19:46,616
RED, EVERYONE'S A GOLFER AT

688
00:19:46,616 --> 00:19:47,951
HEART.

689
00:19:47,951 --> 00:19:49,052
IT'LL ALSO DO THE GUYS SOME GOOD

690
00:19:49,052 --> 00:19:50,386
TO GET OUT AND GET SOME FRESH

691
00:19:50,386 --> 00:19:52,088
AIR, EVEN IF IT'S JUST FOR ONE

692
00:19:52,088 --> 00:19:52,956
GAME.

693
00:19:52,956 --> 00:19:53,890
>> YEAH, YEAH.

694
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:54,924
>> YEAH.

695
00:19:54,924 --> 00:19:55,825
>> AM I IN YOUR WAY HERE AT ALL?

696
00:19:55,825 --> 00:19:56,526
>> OH, I DON'T THINK SO.

697
00:19:56,526 --> 00:19:57,193
>> NO?

698
00:19:57,193 --> 00:19:57,860
>> [chuckles]

699
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,528
I WON'T HURT YOU.

700
00:19:58,528 --> 00:19:59,195
>> OKAY.

701
00:19:59,195 --> 00:20:00,063
>> I'VE BEEN DOIN' THIS FOR A

702
00:20:00,063 --> 00:20:00,897
LONG TIME.

703
00:20:00,897 --> 00:20:02,532
>> YEAH, YEAH.

704
00:20:02,532 --> 00:20:04,100
>> FORE!

705
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,335
>> OH, LOOK AT THAT.

706
00:20:05,335 --> 00:20:06,869
NICE SHOT, NICE SHOT, NICE SHOT.

707
00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:07,670
>> YES!

708
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,305
>> OH, OH, OH--

709
00:20:09,305 --> 00:20:10,573
>> NO.

710
00:20:10,573 --> 00:20:12,308
>> OH.

711
00:20:12,308 --> 00:20:13,409
>> WELL, THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

712
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:14,811
I'VE GOT TO CHECK ALL THE WATER

713
00:20:14,811 --> 00:20:15,845
HAZARDS ANYWAY.

714
00:20:15,845 --> 00:20:17,046
>> OKAY.

715
00:20:17,046 --> 00:20:18,915
SO ABOUT STOCKING THE LAKE.

716
00:20:18,915 --> 00:20:19,749
>> YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP

717
00:20:19,749 --> 00:20:21,084
YOUR HEAD DOWN.

718
00:20:21,084 --> 00:20:21,751
HEAD DOWN.

719
00:20:21,751 --> 00:20:22,785
THAT'S THE PROBLEM, YOU KNOW?

720
00:20:22,785 --> 00:20:23,686
>> YEAH, YEAH.

721
00:20:23,686 --> 00:20:24,487
>> YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE

722
00:20:24,487 --> 00:20:25,621
THOSE GUYS ARE NOT IN FOR A GAME

723
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:26,289
OF GOLF, YOU KNOW?

724
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:27,090
GET OUT THERE, GET SOME FRESH

725
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:27,757
AIR.

726
00:20:27,757 --> 00:20:28,624
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE--

727
00:20:28,624 --> 00:20:29,292
WHAT ARE THEY?

728
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:30,059
THEY DON'T LIKE TO HAVE FUN?

729
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:30,727
IS THAT IT?

730
00:20:30,727 --> 00:20:31,427
>> WELL, NO, I--YOU KNOW WHAT

731
00:20:31,427 --> 00:20:32,095
THEY'RE LIKE.

732
00:20:32,095 --> 00:20:32,829
THEY JUST DON'T LIKE JOINING

733
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:33,863
THINGS, THAT'S ALL.

734
00:20:33,863 --> 00:20:34,597
>> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

735
00:20:34,597 --> 00:20:35,364
THEY JOINED THE LODGE, DIDN'T

736
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:36,032
THEY?

737
00:20:36,032 --> 00:20:37,100
BESIDES, WITH GOLF, THERE'S NO

738
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,268
FISH GUTS TO CLEAN OUT.

739
00:20:39,268 --> 00:20:40,803
>> WELL, THEY REALLY ENJOY THAT.

740
00:20:40,803 --> 00:20:41,671
>> WELL, THEY DON'T--THEY DON'T

741
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:42,405
REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE

742
00:20:42,405 --> 00:20:43,072
MISSING.

743
00:20:43,072 --> 00:20:44,373
>> NO, NO.

744
00:20:44,373 --> 00:20:45,742
>> FORE!

745
00:20:45,742 --> 00:20:46,409
>> OH, BOY.

746
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:47,076
OH, BOY.

747
00:20:47,076 --> 00:20:47,744
OH, BOY.

748
00:20:47,744 --> 00:20:48,444
>> HO--

749
00:20:48,444 --> 00:20:49,712
>> OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

750
00:20:49,712 --> 00:20:50,546
>> [groans]

751
00:20:50,546 --> 00:20:51,614
>> BOB, TAKE IT EASY NOW.

752
00:20:51,614 --> 00:20:52,281
>> [grunts]

753
00:20:52,281 --> 00:20:54,383
>> OH.

754
00:20:54,383 --> 00:20:55,318
>> I CAN'T BE--

755
00:20:55,318 --> 00:20:56,219
SO WHAT SO YOU SAY?

756
00:20:56,219 --> 00:20:57,520
WE GET A LITTLE TOURNEY GOIN',

757
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,754
HUH, BETWEEN THE GUYS?

758
00:20:58,754 --> 00:20:59,622
A LITTLE TOURNAMENT?

759
00:20:59,622 --> 00:21:00,957
>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK SO,

760
00:21:00,957 --> 00:21:02,258
BOB.

761
00:21:02,258 --> 00:21:03,292
I--YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T HAVE ANY

762
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:04,160
GOLF SHOES.

763
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,027
YOU KNOW, I GUESS THEY COULD USE

764
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:06,262
FLIP FLOPS.

765
00:21:06,262 --> 00:21:07,096
BUT THEY'D HAVE TO PAY THEIR

766
00:21:07,096 --> 00:21:08,231
GREEN FEES AND THEN BALLS AND

767
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:08,898
TEES.

768
00:21:08,898 --> 00:21:09,699
THAT'S GONNA SET THEM BACK A,

769
00:21:09,699 --> 00:21:10,600
YOU KNOW, FAIR BIT OF CHANGE

770
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,701
THERE, YOU KNOW.

771
00:21:11,701 --> 00:21:12,435
>> WELL, IT'S CHEAPER THAN

772
00:21:12,435 --> 00:21:14,070
PAYING A PRIVATE COMPANY TO

773
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:17,507
RESTOCK THE LAKE WITH FISH.

774
00:21:17,507 --> 00:21:18,307
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, IF I PUT IT

775
00:21:18,307 --> 00:21:19,742
TO THEM THAT WAY, I THINK THEY

776
00:21:19,742 --> 00:21:21,310
MAY--THEY MAY SIGN UP FOR IT,

777
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,044
YOU KNOW.

778
00:21:22,044 --> 00:21:22,778
>> OH, HO, THERE YOU GO.

779
00:21:22,778 --> 00:21:23,513
>> HAVE A LITTLE--HAVE OWN

780
00:21:23,513 --> 00:21:24,180
TOURNAMENT.

781
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:24,847
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

782
00:21:24,847 --> 00:21:26,048
>> THE POSSUM OPEN, HUH?

783
00:21:26,048 --> 00:21:26,716
>> MM-HMM.

784
00:21:26,716 --> 00:21:27,850
>> AND THE GUYS COULD CATCH DEW

785
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:28,951
WORMS WHILE THEY'RE GOLFIN'.

786
00:21:28,951 --> 00:21:29,819
>> WELL, THERE YOU GO.

787
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:30,486
>> YEAH.

788
00:21:30,486 --> 00:21:31,254
>> SO WHAT DO WE SAY?

789
00:21:31,254 --> 00:21:32,655
SATURDAY AT 6:30?

790
00:21:32,655 --> 00:21:34,190
>> 6:30 IN THE MORNING?

791
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,224
>> WELL, SURE.

792
00:21:35,224 --> 00:21:36,826
THE EARLY BIRD GETS THE WORM.

793
00:21:36,826 --> 00:21:39,629
THE WORM GETS THE FISH.

794
00:21:39,629 --> 00:21:40,296
>> WELL, ALL RIGHT.

795
00:21:40,296 --> 00:21:41,063
6:30 IT IS.

796
00:21:41,063 --> 00:21:41,731
>> OKAY.

797
00:21:41,731 --> 00:21:42,565
>> SEE YOU THEN, BOB.

798
00:21:42,565 --> 00:21:43,499
>> LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

799
00:21:43,499 --> 00:21:44,166
>> YEAH.

800
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:44,867
>> IT'LL BE FUN, RED.

801
00:21:44,867 --> 00:21:45,668
>> YEAH.

802
00:21:45,668 --> 00:21:46,335
>> [laughs]

803
00:21:46,335 --> 00:21:47,803
YEP.

804
00:21:47,803 --> 00:21:50,640
FORE!

805
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,608
[groans]

806
00:22:02,418 --> 00:22:04,754
>> SO ANYWAY, TO MAKE A LONG

807
00:22:04,754 --> 00:22:07,723
STORY FAIRLY LONG, THE BEAR THAT

808
00:22:07,723 --> 00:22:09,392
WANDERED INTO THE LODGE

809
00:22:09,392 --> 00:22:10,393
SPENT A COUPLE OF DAYS HERE

810
00:22:10,393 --> 00:22:12,161
BEFORE STINKY PETERSON REALIZED

811
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:14,563
THAT IT WASN'T MOOSE THOMPSON.

812
00:22:14,563 --> 00:22:15,364
IT WAS DURING A POKER GAME

813
00:22:15,364 --> 00:22:17,333
'CAUSE THE BEAR WAS WINNIN'.

814
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:18,300
AND BESIDES, HE WAS GETTIN'

815
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,569
HONEY ALL OVER THE CARDS.

816
00:22:20,569 --> 00:22:22,138
BUT STINKY'S STILL THINKIN' IT

817
00:22:22,138 --> 00:22:23,105
WAS MOOSE, YOU KNOW, AND HE

818
00:22:23,105 --> 00:22:24,240
ACCUSED HIM OF CHEATIN' BY,

819
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,641
LIKE, HIDIN' CARDS UP HIS

820
00:22:25,641 --> 00:22:26,475
SLEEVE.

821
00:22:26,475 --> 00:22:27,576
SO HE GETS UP, AND WHEN HE TRIES

822
00:22:27,576 --> 00:22:29,879
TO RIP THE FUR COAT OFF OF

823
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:31,047
MOOSE, IT TURNED OUT THAT HE WAS

824
00:22:31,047 --> 00:22:32,114
TRYIN' TO RIP THE HIDE OFF THE

825
00:22:32,114 --> 00:22:33,249
BEAR, AND THAT'S WHEN WE FIGURED

826
00:22:33,249 --> 00:22:34,984
OUT IT WAS A GRIZZLY.

827
00:22:34,984 --> 00:22:36,285
AND THAT SORT OF EXPLAINED WHY

828
00:22:36,285 --> 00:22:37,520
MOOSE HAD LICKED DOWN NINE JARS

829
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,389
OF PEANUT BUTTER FOR SUPPER.

830
00:22:40,389 --> 00:22:41,223
I LOOKED UP FROM MY CARDS.

831
00:22:41,223 --> 00:22:42,425
I SAYS, "HEY, WHAT'S WILD?"

832
00:22:42,425 --> 00:22:44,026
AND THEY SAID, "THE BEAR."

833
00:22:44,026 --> 00:22:44,760
HE HAD US GOING FOR

834
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,428
A WHILE THERE.

835
00:22:45,428 --> 00:22:46,262
WE THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA HURT US

836
00:22:46,262 --> 00:22:48,264
REAL BAD, BUT LUCKILY, HE GOT A

837
00:22:48,264 --> 00:22:49,765
WHIFF OF OLD MAN SEDGEWICK'S

838
00:22:49,765 --> 00:22:50,733
BREATH AND HIGHTAILED IT OFF

839
00:22:50,733 --> 00:22:52,635
INTO THE WOODS.

840
00:22:52,635 --> 00:22:54,003
SO ANYHOW, IF MY WIFE IS

841
00:22:54,003 --> 00:22:55,037
WATCHIN', I'LL BE COMIN'

842
00:22:55,037 --> 00:22:55,905
STRAIGHT HOME TONIGHT, AND TRY

843
00:22:55,905 --> 00:22:57,373
TO LEAVE THE GARAGE DOOR OPEN.

844
00:22:57,373 --> 00:22:59,175
AND THAT WAY I'LL BE ABLE TO SEE

845
00:22:59,175 --> 00:23:00,342
IF YOUR CAR'S ALREADY IN THERE

846
00:23:00,342 --> 00:23:02,211
AND HOPEFULLY, AVOID IT THIS

847
