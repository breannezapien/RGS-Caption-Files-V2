IN FACT, I'M NOT
ANY KIND OF BUFF,

TO STAY OUT OF THE BUFF.

TO TAKE OLD THINGS,

MY OWN MODERN VERSION.

OUT OF THIS PIECE OF

IS THIS TACK HAMMER.

AND MY TRIGGERING MECHANISM
IS THIS FISHING REEL.

THE POINT OF THE HAMMER
WILL SLAM DOWN THROUGH
THE WINDOW

AND DETONATE MY AMMO.

WE GONNA USE FOR AMMO?

WANNA JAM THAT IN THERE.

THAT COMBINES TWO OF MY
FAVOURITE THINGS.

00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:50,168
MEN LIKE DOING
STUFF LIKE THAT,

TAKING TWO ENJOYABLE
ACTIVITIES AND COMBINING THEM.

159
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:55,340

OR BEER AND FOOTBALL

161

AND WOMEN WRESTLING.

JOIN UP A BED AND A BOAT

164
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,649

NOW, THE FIRST STEP IN MAKING
YOUR OWN BOAT BED

168
00:08:10,388 --> 00:08:12,691
IS TO GET YOURSELF
A BED FRAME.

NOW WITH THE HELP OF THE
HANDYMAN'S SECRET WEAPON,

177
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:36,047
THE BED FRAME BECOMES
YOUR BOAT'S KEEL,

178
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:38,550
AND THE MATTRESSES
BECOME YOUR HULL.

179
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,352

YOU KNOW, WITH THE

AND I HACKED UP A GARDEN HOSE,
CONNECTED THEM TOGETHER

SO I CAN BLOW UP ALL THE
AIR MATTRESSES AT ONCE.

BUT HEY,

OF ALL THOSE AIR MATTRESSES

AND THEN MEASURE THAT
AGAINST MY LUNG CAPACITY,
