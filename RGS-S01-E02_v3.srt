00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,213
ONCE SAID, "TRULY CREATIVE WORKS

AND SINCE WE DIDN'T

10
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,151
FINISH THE SHOW, IT'S TIME TO

11

ABANDON IT.

00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:54,888
ABANDON IT BEFORE IT TURNS WILD.

THANK YOU, HAROLD.

NOT THE BEST INTRODUCTION I'VE

26
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,112
EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE, BUT

27
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:21,414
UNCLES CAN'T BE CHOOSERS.

I CAN DO THINGS LIKE THAT, AND

39
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,666
IT GIVES THE SHOW A LOOK.

40
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:40,600
I LIKE TO THINK EVERYTHING

41
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,301
SHOULD HAVE A LOOK.

WE GOT A LOT OF FILM CLIPS.

DON'T TAKE A NAP

IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD

YOU'D BE BETTER OFF

73
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,326
TO KICK IT

74
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:40,993
OR BETTER STILL,

75
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:41,661
JUST LEAVE IT ALONE.

76
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,662
IT WASN'T BOTHERING YOU.

 JUST SAY NO TO TOADS

I GUESS YOU CAN TELL, THIS IS

82
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,376
KIND OF A SPECIAL DAY.

83
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:59,478
YOU KNOW, ONCE IN A WHILE, I DO

84
00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:00,780

WITH THE YOUNGSTERS.

86
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:02,748
AND THIS IS SOMETHING I THINK

87
00:03:02,748 --> 00:03:05,017
MORE AND MORE ADULTS CAN DO...

88
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:07,253
OR EVEN PARENTS.

KNOW, OR IF YOU GET INVOLVED

97

98
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,100

AND I'M SPENDING SOME TIME TODAY

100
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,337

DO YOU WANT TO--OH, NO, NO.

108
00:03:33,779 --> 00:03:34,714

00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,130
YEAH, HE'S GOT THE WHOLE KIT

120
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:51,797

121
00:03:51,797 --> 00:03:52,498
HE REALLY HAS.

122
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:53,366
HE HAS THE WHOLE THING ALL SET

123
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,701
UP.

124
00:03:55,701 --> 00:03:58,170
YOU KNOW, I NEVER HAD ONE OF

125
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,338
THESE.

126
00:03:59,338 --> 00:04:00,506
WHEN I WAS A KID, I ALWAYS

127
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:01,540
WANTED ONE.

128
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,808
BUT OF COURSE, NOW, MY DAD, HE

129
00:04:02,808 --> 00:04:05,878
WOULDN'T SPEND THAT BIT OF TIME.

130
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:08,380
AND SO IT DIDN'T PAY OFF FOR

131
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,348
HIM, YOU KNOW.

132
00:04:09,348 --> 00:04:10,916
AND I THINK, IN A WAY, THAT--

133
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,184
HERE I AM SPENDING TIME WITH A

134
00:04:12,184 --> 00:04:14,286

135
00:04:14,286 --> 00:04:15,321

I'M GETTING TO FINALLY GET THE

137
00:04:17,456 --> 00:04:18,757
THING GOING WITH A MODEL PLANE,

138
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:19,792
WHICH I ALWAYS WANTED AS A KID

139
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:20,793
AND NEVER DID GET--

140
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:23,095
AND THIS IS...SO YOU SEE HOW IT

141
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:25,164
WORKS OUT.

142
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:25,998
BETTER HURRY IT UP, MAX.

143
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:26,932
HAVEN'T GOT ALL DAY.

145
00:04:29,468 --> 00:04:30,736
MUCH AS, JUST AS MUCH AS--I'M

146
00:04:30,736 --> 00:04:32,705
GONNA GET MY GLOVE.

147
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,543
I DON'T HAVE MY GLOVES.

148
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,411
SO I'VE GOT THE HANDYMAN'S

149
00:04:39,411 --> 00:04:41,046

YOU'RE DOING IT ALL WRONG.

159

YOU'RE DOING IT ALL WRONG.

YOU GOT TO UNTIE IT.

166
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:06,572
THERE. THAT'S IT.

167
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:09,008
THEY LIKE THE GUIDANCE.

168
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,609
DON'T WANT TO JUST SIT BACK AND

169
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:11,944
LET THEM DO IT ANY OLD WHICH

170
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:12,978
WAY, BECAUSE THIS IS HOW THEY

171
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:14,947
CAN LEARN.

172
00:05:23,355 --> 00:05:25,624
THIS WEEK IN "HANDYMAN CORNER,"

173
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:27,593
WE'RE GONNA SHOW YOU HOW TO GET

174
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,561
MORE AND MORE USES OUT OF YOUR

175
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:31,296
ELECTRIC DRILL.

176
00:05:31,296 --> 00:05:33,699
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK

177
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:35,467
ME, "RED," THEY SAY, "IF I ONLY

178
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:36,769
CAN AFFORD TO BUY ONE POWER

179
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,203
TOOL, WHAT SHOULD I BUY?"

180
00:05:38,203 --> 00:05:39,772
WELL, NOW THAT THEY'VE MADE

181
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,340
FLAMETHROWERS ILLEGAL, I WOULD

182
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,808
HAVE TO RECOMMEND THE POWER

183
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:44,476
ELECTRIC DRILL.

184
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:45,811
FIRST OF ALL, YOU CAN USE IT FOR

185
00:05:45,811 --> 00:05:48,580
DRILLING.

186
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,549
[drill buzzing]

187
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,052
YOU CAN ALSO USE IT TO COOL DOWN

188
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:55,053
THE WORKSHOP.

189
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:57,022
[drill buzzing]

190
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:00,392
JUST, YOU KNOW, HANG THAT FROM

191
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:02,261
THE CEILING WITH THE HANDYMAN'S

192
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:06,031
SECRET WEAPON, DUCT TAPE.

193
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:07,232
NOW, THEY TRY TO SELL YOU ONE OF

194
00:06:07,232 --> 00:06:09,234
THOSE FANCY AUTOMATIC POWER

195
00:06:09,234 --> 00:06:11,737
SCREWDRIVING DEALS, AND THEY

196
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:13,705
COST ANYWHERE UP TO SEVEN OR

197
00:06:13,705 --> 00:06:15,040
EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS.

198
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,375
WELL, ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS TO

199
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,609
GET THE BIT, WHICH IS ABOUT

200
00:06:17,609 --> 00:06:18,977
$1.49 AND JUST PUT IT INTO YOUR

201
00:06:18,977 --> 00:06:22,181
NORMAL DRILL, AND IT JUST WORKS

202
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:23,182
JUST ABSOLUTELY FINE.

203
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,150
[drill buzzing]

204
00:06:29,755 --> 00:06:32,391
YOU GET THE IDEA.

205
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,326
NOW, YOU KNOW, THEY TRY TO SELL

206
00:06:34,326 --> 00:06:35,327
YOU A BUNCH OF ATTACHMENTS FOR

207
00:06:35,327 --> 00:06:37,262
YOUR DRILL, BUT THE TRUTH IS,

208
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:38,163
THE ATTACHMENTS REALLY DON'T

209
00:06:38,163 --> 00:06:39,164
MAKE THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE.

210
00:06:39,164 --> 00:06:41,099
THE REAL REASON THAT THE DRILL

211
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:42,734
WORKS IS THROUGH YOU HORSING

212
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:43,869
DOWN ON HER AND REALLY PUTTING

213
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:44,903
SOME TORSION ON IT.

214
00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:47,105
YOU CAN CUT A HOLE WITH ANYTHING

215
00:06:47,105 --> 00:06:48,540
FROM A TOOTHBRUSH TO A CAR KEY

216
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,108
IF YOU GET ENOUGH JUICE ON HER,

217
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:50,776
YOU KNOW.

218
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:51,877
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, THEY'LL SELL

219
00:06:51,877 --> 00:06:53,545
YOU A REAL EXPENSIVE SAW BLADE

220
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:55,147
THAT GOES ON YOUR DRILL.

221
00:06:55,147 --> 00:06:55,814
WELL, THAT'S REALLY NOT

222
00:06:55,814 --> 00:06:56,648
NECESSARY.

223
00:06:56,648 --> 00:06:57,749
I'LL SHOW YOU RIGHT HERE HOW YOU

224
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:59,651
CAN, YOU CAN CUT A PERFECTLY

225
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:00,819
GOOD LINE JUST USING YOUR

226
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:02,788
ORDINARY DRILL WITH A DRILL BIT

227
00:07:02,788 --> 00:07:03,789
IN IT HERE.

228
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:06,758
[drill buzzing]

229
00:07:23,608 --> 00:07:24,276
ALL RIGHT,

230
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:25,043
YOU'VE GOT TO BE PREPARED TO

231
00:07:25,043 --> 00:07:26,345
GIVE IT A LITTLE MORE TIME THIS

232
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:27,746
WAY, BUT YOU'RE SAVING UPWARDS

233
00:07:27,746 --> 00:07:29,114
OF FIVE DOLLARS.

234
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:31,550
NOW, HERE'S SOMETHING THAT YOU

235
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,517
WOULDN'T ORDINARILY THINK TO USE

236
00:07:32,517 --> 00:07:33,452
A DRILL FOR.

237
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:34,252
AND THIS IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO

238
00:07:34,252 --> 00:07:35,387
SAY, IS THAT YOU'RE ONLY LIMITED

239
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:36,755
BY YOUR OWN IMAGINATION.

240
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:38,657
AND YOU CAN DEAL WITH THAT AS

241
00:07:38,657 --> 00:07:39,891
YOU MAY.

242
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:41,193
BUT HERE'S A SITUATION WHERE YOU

243
00:07:41,193 --> 00:07:42,461
TAKE TWO WIRES THAT YOU WOULD

244
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:43,295
WANT TO STRAND TOGETHER, MAKE

245
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:44,396
SOME SORT OF A BRAIDING PATTERN.

246
00:07:44,396 --> 00:07:45,297
JUST TWIST THEM TOGETHER, MAKE A

247
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:46,098
NEATER LOOK FOR

248
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,699
WHATEVER IT IS, MAYBE YOU'RE

249
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:48,834
REWIRING YOUR STOVE OR WHATEVER.

250
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:49,968
WHAT YOU DO IS, YOU PUT BOTH

251
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:52,104
ENDS OF THE WIRE IN THERE, AND

252
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,805
YOU TAKE YOUR TWO STRANDS, AND

253
00:07:53,805 --> 00:07:55,841
YOU TURN ON THE DRILL FROM A

254
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:57,876
REMOTE SETTING AND THEN SLOWLY

255
00:07:57,876 --> 00:07:59,177
JUST WALK TOWARDS IT WHILE IT

256
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:00,212
WINDS IN.

257
00:08:00,212 --> 00:08:01,480
IT'S A HECK OF A RIG, AND IT'S

258
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,147
NOT SOMETHING YOU WOULD

259
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:02,881
ORDINARILY THINK OF WITH A

260
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:03,548
DRILL.

261
00:08:03,548 --> 00:08:04,382
SO WHY DON'T WE JUST GIVE THIS,

262
00:08:04,382 --> 00:08:07,185
GIVE THIS A TRY.

263
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:08,286
ALL RIGHT, BOYS, YOU WANT TO HIT

264
00:08:08,286 --> 00:08:09,287
THE POWER THERE?

265
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:10,689
[drill buzzing]

266
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:11,356
THERE WE GO.

267
00:08:11,356 --> 00:08:12,924
JUST LOOK AT THAT.

268
00:08:12,924 --> 00:08:14,359
[wire whipping]

269
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:15,694
ALL RIGHT, DO YOU WANT TO KILL

270
00:08:15,694 --> 00:08:16,862
THAT?

271
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:18,830
KILL THAT NOW.

272
00:08:26,438 --> 00:08:28,506
ALL RIGHT, SO IF YOU ARE

273
00:08:28,506 --> 00:08:29,641
THINKING OF BUYING A POWER TOOL,

274
00:08:29,641 --> 00:08:31,176
I'D RECOMMEND YOU GO OUT AND GET

275
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:32,477
YOURSELF A NEW DRILL.

276
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:35,814
LOOKS LIKE I'M GONNA HAVE TO.

277
00:08:35,814 --> 00:08:36,848
ANYWAY, SO UNTIL NEXT TIME,

278
00:08:36,848 --> 00:08:38,149
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN DON'T

279
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:39,417
FIND YOU HANDSOME, THEY SHOULD

280
00:08:39,417 --> 00:08:42,554
AT LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

281
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:44,222
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE

282
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:45,757
FUN IN THE FOREST, MORE FILM

283
00:08:45,757 --> 00:08:47,659
CLIPS, AND MORE ABOUT MOOSE AND

284
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:48,493
ELVIS.

285
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:52,764
>> [singing] TREAT ME LIKE A FOOL

286
00:08:52,764 --> 00:08:57,569
OR WHAT, EH?

287
00:08:57,569 --> 00:08:58,269
>> OKAY.

288
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:02,107
THIS IS EXCITING AND LOOKS VERY,

289
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:06,678
VERY DANGEROUS.

290
00:09:06,678 --> 00:09:07,746
WELL, MAYBE IT'S NOT THAT

291
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:11,950
DANGEROUS.

292
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,851
I'LL JUST WAIT FOR THE PAIN TO

293
00:09:12,851 --> 00:09:13,518
GO DOWN A BIT.

294
00:09:13,518 --> 00:09:15,487
YEP.

295

>> "IT IS WINTER.

THE FOXES, TOO, GROW A THICK

WINTER COAT, AS DO THE MINKS AND

THE RACCOONS.

301
00:09:33,705 --> 00:09:36,074
BUT WE CANNOT GROW A THICK COAT,

302
00:09:36,074 --> 00:09:37,909
SO WE JUST KILL THEM AND TAKE

303
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:41,146
THEIRS."

304
00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:42,313
OKAY, NOW, I WAS

305
00:09:42,313 --> 00:09:44,115
TELLING YOU ABOUT MOOSE THOMPSON

306
00:09:44,115 --> 00:09:44,949
AND ELVIS.

307
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:46,851
MOOSE WAS DOWN AT THE

308
00:09:46,851 --> 00:09:48,586
SUPERMARKET, AND HE TOLD

309
00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:49,854
EVERYBODY THAT HE SAW THE GHOST

310
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:51,156
OF ELVIS IN THE CHINESE FOOD

311
00:09:51,156 --> 00:09:52,023
SECTION.

312
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:53,324
BUT NOBODY BELIEVED HIM.

313
00:09:53,324 --> 00:09:54,926
AND THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT IT

314
00:09:54,926 --> 00:09:56,594
WASN'T THE CHINESE FOOD SECTION.

315
00:09:56,594 --> 00:09:58,129
IT WAS IN THE DELICATESSEN.

316
00:09:58,129 --> 00:09:59,731
AND SUDDENLY THE STORY HAD AN

317
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:01,933
EERIE RING OF TRUTH TO IT.

318

YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST A THOUGHT.

326
00:10:13,011 --> 00:10:14,312
WHAT ABOUT THAT?

REALLY GOOD.

331
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:19,183
JUST THAT NOBODY LIKES 'EM.

332
00:10:19,183 --> 00:10:20,318
MAYBE WE SHOULD PUT A MUSIC

333

SHE'S REALLY GOOD.

00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:30,161
MAYBE PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR

342
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:31,329
HER RATHER THAN ABOUT MOOSE

343
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:33,298
THOMPSON'S HALLUCINATIONS.

344
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:34,532
PEOPLE UNDER 80 WOULD RATHER

345
00:10:34,532 --> 00:10:35,700
HEAR THAT, I THINK.

346
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,101
>> THIS WASN'T A HALLUCINATION,

347
00:10:37,101 --> 00:10:38,202
HAROLD.

348
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:39,570
I MEAN, ELVIS COULD NOT BE A

349
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,471
HALLUCINATION, OKAY?

350
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:41,139
>> OH, YEAH?

351
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:41,806
YOU DON'T KNOW.

352
00:10:41,806 --> 00:10:42,540
MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THIS

353
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,610
HAPPENED.

354
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:46,811
>> DID YOU JUST CUT ME OFF,

355
00:10:46,811 --> 00:10:47,745
HAROLD?

356
00:10:47,745 --> 00:10:50,281
>> NO, IT WAS A HALLUCINATION.

357
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:54,601
[light guitar and spoon music]

358
00:10:56,921 --> 00:10:57,789
>> I HEAR THE SIZZLE

359
00:10:57,789 --> 00:11:00,591
OF BACON ON THE ENGINE BLOCK

360
00:11:00,591 --> 00:11:01,659
I SEE A HANDFUL

361
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:02,460
OF HASH BROWNS

362
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,895
LYING IN MY SOCK

363
00:11:03,895 --> 00:11:05,930
I WATCH A STACK OF PANCAKES

364
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,765
GO ROLLING DOWN THE DOCK

365
00:11:07,765 --> 00:11:09,267
BREAKFAST IS HELL

366
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:13,504
WHEN THE STOVE BLOWS UP

367
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:14,505
ALL RIGHT.

368
00:11:14,505 --> 00:11:16,607
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO NOW IS ADJUST

369
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:21,446
THE MOTOR.

370
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:22,613
MAX, GIVE ME THE FUEL.

371
00:11:22,613 --> 00:11:23,548
GET ME THE FUEL.

372
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:24,549
IT'S IN THE--GET THE FUEL.

373
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:26,818
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

374
00:11:26,818 --> 00:11:29,720
THIS--NO--ALL RIGHT.

375
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,426
>> OH, UNCLE RED.

376
00:11:35,426 --> 00:11:36,327
GREAT. EXCELLENT.

377
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:37,261
IT'S THE PART OF THE SHOW THAT

378
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:38,029
YOU LIKE BEST.

379
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:40,898
>> OH, ALL RIGHT.

380
00:11:40,898 --> 00:11:43,134
SO LONG AND THANKS FOR WATCHING.

381
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:44,368
>> OH, NO, NO, NO.

382
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:45,203
UNCLE RED, I MEANT, LIKE, MALE

383
00:11:45,203 --> 00:11:45,937
CALL.

384
00:11:45,937 --> 00:11:47,205
THE PART WHERE WE ANSWER VIEWER

385
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:47,939
MAIL?

386
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:48,606
>> AH.

387
00:11:48,606 --> 00:11:49,440
>> I GOT A LETTER RIGHT HERE.

388
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,241
IT'S HARD TO READ, THOUGH.

389
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:51,108
IT'S LIKE, ON COLORED PAPER IN

390
00:11:51,108 --> 00:11:52,477
CRAYON.

391
00:11:52,477 --> 00:11:54,445
"DEAR POSSUM, I REALLY LIKE YOUR

392
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:55,279
SHOW.

393
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,747
I HAVE ALL OF THEM ON TAPE.

394
00:11:56,747 --> 00:11:57,849
I'VE WATCHED EVERY ONE OF THEM

395
00:11:57,849 --> 00:11:59,951
50 TIRES--TIMES.

396
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:02,220
50 TIMES.

397
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,589
I THINK YOU ARE VERY WISP.

398
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:05,256
WISE."

399
00:12:05,256 --> 00:12:06,123
HE THINKS YOU'RE VERY WISE,

400
00:12:06,123 --> 00:12:06,958
UNCLE RED.

401
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,427
"I AM YOUR BIGGEST FAR."

402
00:12:09,427 --> 00:12:10,494
WHAT'S A FAR?

403
00:12:10,494 --> 00:12:13,731
>> WELL, THAT WOULD BE A FAN.

404
00:12:13,731 --> 00:12:14,498
BIGGEST FAN.

405
00:12:14,498 --> 00:12:16,067
>> LOOKS LIKE "FAR."

406
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:17,101
>> WELL, IT'LL BE "FAN."

407
00:12:17,101 --> 00:12:18,869
LET ME SEE.

408
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:20,104
LOT OF TIMES, SMALL "N" LOOKS

409
00:12:20,104 --> 00:12:20,805
LIKE A SMALL "R."

410
00:12:20,805 --> 00:12:21,606
>> YEAH, BUT THAT'S A CAPITAL

411
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:23,074
"R."

412
00:12:23,074 --> 00:12:24,141
>> MUST BE THE BIGGEST "FAR."

413
00:12:24,141 --> 00:12:24,942
ALL RIGHT.

414
00:12:24,942 --> 00:12:26,043
OKAY.

415
00:12:26,043 --> 00:12:26,978
I'VE GOT A FAR. THAT'S NICE.

416
00:12:26,978 --> 00:12:29,080
I GOT ARE FANS; "FAR" IS KIND OF

417
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,314
A NICE CHANGE.

418
00:12:30,314 --> 00:12:31,816
>> IT SAYS, "I WANT TO START A

419
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:32,750
FAR CLUB."

420
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,385
>> I THINK HE MEANS A FAN CLUB

421
00:12:34,385 --> 00:12:35,252
THERE, HAROLD.

422
00:12:35,252 --> 00:12:36,220
>> "I THOUGHT A FAR CLUB WOULD

423

BE NICE SINCE YOU PROBABLY

424
00:12:37,288 --> 00:12:39,857
ALREADY HAVE A FAN CLUB.

425
00:12:39,857 --> 00:12:40,858
TO START THE FAR CLUB, I WILL

426
00:12:40,858 --> 00:12:41,826
NEED YOUR APPROVAL.

IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU?

SIGNED, 'X.'"

I MEAN, HAROLD, EVERY STAR

431

CLUB TO GO, DO YOU THINK?

436
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:55,973
>> PROBABLY PRETTY FAR.

437
00:12:55,973 --> 00:12:57,008
IT'S A FAR CLUB.

438
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:58,843
>> THE FARTHER THE BETTER, IF

439
00:12:58,843 --> 00:12:59,844
YOU ASK ME.

440
00:12:59,844 --> 00:13:01,112
OKAY, SURE.

WHOEVER YOU ARE, GO AHEAD, START

442
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,215

OKAY, THE "RED GROIN FAR CLUB."

447
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:12,056
PERFECT.

448
00:13:12,056 --> 00:13:13,224
IF ANY OF YOU VIEWERS AT HOME

449
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:15,059
WANT TO BECOME A MEMBER OF THAT

450
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:17,728
BEAUTIFUL-SOUNDING CLUB, HAROLD,

451
00:13:17,728 --> 00:13:18,529
WHY DON'T YOU JUST HOLD UP THE

452
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:19,196
RETURN ADDRESS.

453
00:13:19,196 --> 00:13:20,064
YOU CAN GET DIRECTLY IN TOUCH

454
00:13:20,064 --> 00:13:20,865
WITH THIS GUY.

455
00:13:20,865 --> 00:13:21,999
>> DIDN'T EVEN SEND ONE.

456
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:23,100
JUST LIKE A CHEWED-UP WAD OF GUM

457
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,069
AND A ROCK IN A PLASTIC BAG,

458
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:26,771
UNCLE RED.

459
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:28,105
>> IT'S QUITE A COUNTRY WE GOT

460
00:13:28,105 --> 00:13:29,106
HERE, HAROLD.

461
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:29,940
GOT TO HAVE A LICENSE TO BUY A

462
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,008
GUN, BUT THEY'LL SELL ANYBODY A

463
00:13:31,008 --> 00:13:32,109
STAMP.

464
00:13:32,109 --> 00:13:34,111
WHAT KIND OF GUM IS IT?

465
00:13:34,111 --> 00:13:35,646
>> IT'S DOUBLE-BUBBLE OR

466
00:13:35,646 --> 00:13:36,413
SOMETHING.

467
00:13:36,413 --> 00:13:37,748
>> OH, I'LL HAVE THAT.

468
00:13:37,748 --> 00:13:38,516
YOU HAVE THE ROCK.

469
00:13:38,516 --> 00:13:40,484
>> OH, OKAY.

470
00:13:44,088 --> 00:13:46,357
>> WE DO GET WINTER IN THIS

471
00:13:46,357 --> 00:13:49,193
COUNTRY, AND BILL AND I THINK

472
00:13:49,193 --> 00:13:52,129
THAT ONE OF THE KEYS TO MAKE THE

473
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:54,031
BEST OF WINTER IS TO GET OUT AND

474
00:13:54,031 --> 00:13:55,132
ENJOY IT AND ACTUALLY TAKE

475
00:13:55,132 --> 00:13:58,035
ACTIVITIES AND JUST DO THEM, YOU

476
00:13:58,035 --> 00:13:58,702
KNOW.

477
00:13:58,702 --> 00:13:59,503
BECAUSE WHEN YOU GET GOING--

478
00:13:59,503 --> 00:14:00,804
HERE HE IS, GOING DOWN ON A

479
00:14:00,804 --> 00:14:02,740
SLED, AND, YOU KNOW,

480
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,741
HE'S HAVING SO DARN MUCH

481
00:14:03,741 --> 00:14:05,976
FUN THAT HE REALLY DOESN'T

482
00:14:05,976 --> 00:14:07,411
NOTICE THE COLD OR THE, OR THE,

483
00:14:07,411 --> 00:14:10,014
ANY KIND OF--THERE'S NO--OH, MY

484
00:14:10,014 --> 00:14:11,782
GOD.

485
00:14:11,782 --> 00:14:14,218
BUT IT'S--THAT'S ALL PART OF THE

486
00:14:14,218 --> 00:14:16,787
FUN, ISN'T IT?

487
00:14:16,787 --> 00:14:19,290
HE'S--HE LOOKS ALL RIGHT.

488
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:19,957
YEAH.

489
00:14:19,957 --> 00:14:20,724
YEAH, YEAH.

490
00:14:20,724 --> 00:14:22,459
BUT WE WANTED TO SHOW YOU TODAY

491
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:23,961
HOW YOU CAN HAVE SOME FUN WITH

492
00:14:23,961 --> 00:14:25,763
THE WINTER.

493
00:14:25,763 --> 00:14:27,264
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU

494
00:14:27,264 --> 00:14:28,499
DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

495
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:29,667
YOU DON'T HAVE TO JOIN AN

496
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:31,468
EXPENSIVE SKI CLUB OR ANY SUCH

497
00:14:31,468 --> 00:14:34,938
THING AS THAT.

498
00:14:34,938 --> 00:14:36,607
IT HELPS IF YOU CAN'T READ.

499
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:37,608
BUT EVEN IF YOU HAVE JUST A

500
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:39,076
CARDBOARD BOX, I BELIEVE THIS IS

501
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:40,778
FROM A DRYER OR A WASHER, OR IT

502
00:14:40,778 --> 00:14:42,513
MIGHT'VE JUST BEEN THE DOUGHNUTS

503
00:14:42,513 --> 00:14:43,447
THAT WE GOT.

504
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:45,082
AND THEN INTO THE BOX, YOU SEE.

505
00:14:45,082 --> 00:14:48,318
AND WELL, THAT WASN'T--YOU DON'T

506
00:14:48,318 --> 00:14:49,319
WANT TO GO DOWN ON THAT.

507
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:50,554
YOU WANT TO GO DOWN STANDING

508
00:14:50,554 --> 00:14:52,289
UPRIGHT IN THE, IN THE THING.

509
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:53,223
AND BILL WILL SHOW YOU.

510
00:14:53,223 --> 00:14:54,491
THIS IS A LOT OF FUN 'CAUSE YOU

511
00:14:54,491 --> 00:14:55,359
REALLY CAN'T SEE WHAT YOU'RE

512
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:56,527
GONNA HIT.

513
00:14:56,527 --> 00:14:58,562
WELL, I DON'T THINK THAT WAS

514
00:14:58,562 --> 00:15:00,197
BILL'S TOP END.

515
00:15:00,197 --> 00:15:01,932
COME ON, BILL, COME ON.

516
00:15:01,932 --> 00:15:03,133
UP YOU GO. UP YOU GO.

517
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:05,436
THERE HE IS.

518
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:06,470
WELL, WE JAM HIM DOWN THERE AND

519
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,307
FLIP HIM OVER AND AWAY HE GOES.

520
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:12,476
AND HERE'S ANOTHER INEXPENSIVE

521
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:13,777
SLED YOU CAN USE.

522
00:15:13,777 --> 00:15:15,712
THIS IS A GARBAGE CAN LID, AND

523
00:15:15,712 --> 00:15:17,214
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE THE

524
00:15:17,214 --> 00:15:20,918
PLASTIC--[stammering]

525
00:15:20,918 --> 00:15:24,855
AND THIS IS SOMETHING I--JUST TO

526
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:25,756
ANOTHER WRINKLE, PUT HIM RIGHT

527
00:15:25,756 --> 00:15:26,924
INTO THE CAN.

528
00:15:26,924 --> 00:15:29,760
YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY WHERE BILL

529
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,061
BELONGS MOST OF THE TIME ANYHOW,

530
00:15:31,061 --> 00:15:31,728
YOU KNOW.

531
00:15:31,728 --> 00:15:32,830
AND THIS WOULD MAKE IT MORE

532
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,764
EXCITING FOR HIM, KIND OF LIKE

533
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:35,666
SPACE MOUNTAIN AT DISNEY WORLD.

534
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,634
OH, HE'S HAVING A GOOD TIME.

535
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:39,870
AND, GOLLY, THAT WOULD MAKE YOU

536
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,138
DIZZY, WOULDN'T IT?

537
00:15:41,138 --> 00:15:42,439
I SAID, "BILL, WHEN YOU FINISH,

538
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:43,774
IF YOU'RE OKAY, JUST GIVE US THE

539
00:15:43,774 --> 00:15:44,508
WAVE, YOU KNOW?"

540
00:15:44,508 --> 00:15:46,944
AND THERE IT IS.

541
00:15:46,944 --> 00:15:50,447
YEAH, YEAH, HE'S FINE.

542
00:15:50,447 --> 00:15:53,717
"IT IS WINTER, WHEN PEOPLE WAVE

543
00:15:53,717 --> 00:15:54,985
TO YOU FROM THE WARMTH OF THEIR

544
00:15:54,985 --> 00:15:57,754
CARS OR SHOUT 'HELLO!' AS THEY

545
00:15:57,754 --> 00:15:59,957
HURRY BY WITH THEIR PACKAGES.

546
00:15:59,957 --> 00:16:01,825
BUT YOU CAN'T ANSWER, BECAUSE

547
00:16:01,825 --> 00:16:03,193
YOUR TONGUE IS FROZEN TO YOUR

548
00:16:03,193 --> 00:16:05,162
SLEIGH."

549
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,575
THIS IS THE TIME IN THE

550
00:16:18,575 --> 00:16:20,944
SHOW WHERE WE JUST TAKE A MINUTE

551
00:16:20,944 --> 00:16:22,879
OUT FROM THE ENTERTAINMENT AND

552
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:24,715
THE PLEASANTRIES AND HAVE A

553
00:16:24,715 --> 00:16:26,450
CHANCE JUST TO BE SORT OF BORED

554
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,517
OUT OF OUR MINDS.

555
00:16:27,517 --> 00:16:30,220
HAROLD.

556
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,822
>> OKAY, I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT

557
00:16:31,822 --> 00:16:33,023
YOUR FIRST DATE.

558
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,993
OKAY, MANY OF YOU, UNLIKE ME,

559
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:37,260
HAVE NEVER BEEN OUT ON A REAL

560
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:41,932
DATE WITH A GIRL.

561
00:16:41,932 --> 00:16:44,701
OKAY, FIRST THINGS FIRST.

562
00:16:44,701 --> 00:16:45,502
OKAY.

563
00:16:45,502 --> 00:16:47,971
DON'T, DO NOT TRY AND KISS HER

564
00:16:47,971 --> 00:16:49,072
IN THE HALLWAY WITH HER PARENTS

565
00:16:49,072 --> 00:16:50,006
THERE.

566
00:16:50,006 --> 00:16:51,575
DON'T.

567
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:53,276
SECOND, NEVER MAKE FUN OF PEOPLE

568
00:16:53,276 --> 00:16:54,811
WHO PLAY LOTTERIES UNTIL YOU'VE

569
00:16:54,811 --> 00:16:56,279
ASCERTAINED IF INDEED SHE PLAYS

570
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,848
LOTTERIES.

571
00:16:57,848 --> 00:16:59,783
AND, THE WORST--WHOEVER THOUGHT

572
00:16:59,783 --> 00:17:00,751
THIS COULD'VE HAPPENED, BUT IT

573
00:17:00,751 --> 00:17:03,153
WAS HORRIBLE--MAYBE HER FAMILY

574
00:17:03,153 --> 00:17:03,987
MAKES THEIR LIVING SELLING

575
00:17:03,987 --> 00:17:06,757
LOTTERY TICKETS.

576
00:17:06,757 --> 00:17:08,058
AND, AND WHEN YOU GET OUT TO THE

577
00:17:08,058 --> 00:17:09,559
CAR AND HER FOOT'S NOT INSIDE

578
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:12,095
THE CAR, DON'T SLAM THE DOOR.

579
00:17:12,095 --> 00:17:13,497
DON'T DO THAT.

580
00:17:13,497 --> 00:17:14,664
LIKE, DON'T, LIKE MAYBE YOU

581
00:17:14,664 --> 00:17:15,398
THINK IT'S THE SEAT BELT OR

582
00:17:15,398 --> 00:17:16,299
SOMETHING AND YOU KEEP SLAMMING

583
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:17,234
IT.

584
00:17:17,234 --> 00:17:18,768
IT'S NOT, IT'S HER LEG.

585
00:17:18,768 --> 00:17:20,403
IT SMARTS, ACCORDING TO PEOPLE

586
00:17:20,403 --> 00:17:21,805
WHO HAVE BEEN THERE.

587
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:24,241
AND NEXT, WHEN YOU GO OUT TO

588
00:17:24,241 --> 00:17:26,510
DINNER, AND SAY, SAY YOU DON'T

589
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,577
HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO COVER THE

590
00:17:27,577 --> 00:17:28,845
BILL, OKAY?

591
00:17:28,845 --> 00:17:30,814
DON'T START CRYING.

592
00:17:30,814 --> 00:17:31,982
DON'T.

593
00:17:31,982 --> 00:17:32,849
DOESN'T HELP.

594
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:34,084
JUST BE REALLY CAS AND COOL

595
00:17:34,084 --> 00:17:34,784
ABOUT IT, RIGHT?

596
00:17:34,784 --> 00:17:36,319
JUST SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT?

597
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:37,654
I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA HAVE

598
00:17:37,654 --> 00:17:39,256
GRAVY ON MY FRIES."

599
00:17:39,256 --> 00:17:40,790
LOOK AT THAT, RIGHT?

600
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,625
YOU'RE OUT OF THE SITUATION.

601
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:42,726
SLICK, RIGHT?

602
00:17:42,726 --> 00:17:43,393
OKAY.

603
00:17:43,393 --> 00:17:44,294
THEN, YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE YOU

604
00:17:44,294 --> 00:17:45,061
DON'T DO?

605
00:17:45,061 --> 00:17:46,463
DON'T GO TO A GERMAN ART FILM.

606
00:17:46,463 --> 00:17:48,498
AND DO NOT READ THE SUBTITLES TO

607
00:17:48,498 --> 00:17:49,733
HER UNTIL SHE LOOKS AT YOU REAL

608
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:51,234
SWEET-LIKE AND GOES, "WOULD YOU

609
00:17:51,234 --> 00:17:52,869
SHUT UP?"

610
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:54,237
DON'T DO THAT.

611
00:17:54,237 --> 00:17:55,538
AND, AND THEN FINALLY, WHEN

612
00:17:55,538 --> 00:17:56,640
YOU'RE GOING HOME AND YOU'RE

613
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,742
KISSING HER GOOD-NIGHT AND SHE

614
00:17:58,742 --> 00:18:02,579
DOESN'T WANT TO, DON'T ASK HER

615
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:04,748
WHY.

616
00:18:04,748 --> 00:18:08,852
BELIEVE ME, IT HURTS.

617
00:18:08,852 --> 00:18:12,555
THANK YOU.

618
00:18:12,555 --> 00:18:13,623
>> DON'T GO AWAY.

619
00:18:13,623 --> 00:18:14,758
WE GOT THE END OF THE MOOSE AND

620
00:18:14,758 --> 00:18:16,259
ELVIS STORY COMING UP.

621
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:21,197
>> ENQUIRING MINDS DON'T CARE.

622
00:18:21,197 --> 00:18:22,365
>> GIVE ME THE FUEL THERE, MAX.

623
00:18:22,365 --> 00:18:24,334
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

624
00:18:28,505 --> 00:18:29,539
>> YOU SPEND A LITTLE TIME WITH

625
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:30,707
THESE KIDS, AND BEFORE YOU KNOW

626
00:18:30,707 --> 00:18:32,709
IT--YOU GOT TO PUSH DOWN ON THAT

627
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:33,476
WHILE YOU'RE TURNING IT.

628
00:18:33,476 --> 00:18:35,812
CAN'T YOU READ?

629
00:18:35,812 --> 00:18:36,579
PUSH DOWN. NO, NO.

630
00:18:36,579 --> 00:18:37,447
PUSH DOWN HARDER WHILE YOU'RE

631
00:18:37,447 --> 00:18:39,182
TURNING IT.

632
00:18:39,182 --> 00:18:40,583
TURN THAT AND PUSH DOWN.

633
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:41,751
PUSH DOWN AND TURN THAT.

634
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:44,521
TURN--PUSH--PUSH--PUSH--YEAH.

635
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:45,221
YEAH.

636
00:18:45,221 --> 00:18:46,523
YEP.

637
00:18:46,523 --> 00:18:48,458
DON'T KNOCK IT OVER.

638
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,159
YOU DO THOUGH, YOU DO.

639
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:49,993
YOU DO IT. YOU DO IT.

640
00:18:49,993 --> 00:18:51,194
OKAY, CAREFUL. CAREFUL.

641
00:18:51,194 --> 00:18:52,429
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

642
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:53,096
THAT'S ENOUGH.

643
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:53,763
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

644
00:18:53,763 --> 00:18:54,431
ALL RIGHT.

645
00:18:54,431 --> 00:18:55,098
NOW PUT THE LID ON IT.

646
00:18:55,098 --> 00:18:55,765
PUT THE LID ON IT.

647
00:18:55,765 --> 00:19:00,170
PUT THE LID ON IT.

648
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,238
I'M HERE TODAY WITH A MAN WHO IS

649
00:19:02,238 --> 00:19:03,473
LIVING HIS DREAM.

650
00:19:03,473 --> 00:19:06,209
BY DAY, HE DELIVERS FOOD FOR

651
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:08,545
PEOPLE, AND ON THE WEEKEND, HE

652
00:19:08,545 --> 00:19:10,814
DRIVES HIS MONSTER TRUCK AROUND,

653
00:19:10,814 --> 00:19:12,148
CRUSHING CARS.

654
00:19:12,148 --> 00:19:14,350
MY GOOD BUDDY, DOUGIE FRANKLIN.

655
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,752
>> THANK YOU, RED.

656
00:19:15,752 --> 00:19:18,655
AS THE SIGN SAYS, I LOVE THIS

657
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,823
TRUCK, AND I LOVE THE WORK I DO

658
00:19:19,823 --> 00:19:20,857
IN IT.

659
00:19:20,857 --> 00:19:22,492
YOU SHOULD SEE THE LOOK ON SOME

660
00:19:22,492 --> 00:19:23,927
OF THESE PEOPLE'S FACES WHEN

661
00:19:23,927 --> 00:19:26,329
THEY SEE THIS VEHICLE COMING

662
00:19:26,329 --> 00:19:27,997
ACROSS THEIR FRONT LAWN.

663
00:19:27,997 --> 00:19:29,032
>> OH.

664
00:19:29,032 --> 00:19:30,733
>> AND BEING SO HIGH UP, TOO,

665
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:31,834
THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO COME

666
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:33,169
DOWNSTAIRS FOR THEIR DINNER.

667
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:34,370
I CAN JUST SLIP IT RIGHT THROUGH

668
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,439
THE SECOND STORY WINDOW TO THEM.

669
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:37,507
IT'S A CONVENIENT THING.

670
00:19:37,507 --> 00:19:39,676
BUT YOU KNOW, RED, SOME OF THESE

671
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:41,010
PEOPLE, THEY GOT NOTHING.

672
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,412
THEY GOT NO FOOD; THEY GOT

673
00:19:42,412 --> 00:19:43,179
NOTHING.

674
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:45,515
IT'S--THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG

675
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:47,650
WITH A SOCIETY WHEN SOME PEOPLE

676
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,118
HAVE SO MUCH AND OTHER PEOPLE

677
00:19:49,118 --> 00:19:50,486
HAVE SO LITTLE.

678
00:19:50,486 --> 00:19:51,354
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE WE

679
00:19:51,354 --> 00:19:52,622
GOT OUR PRIORITIES SCREWED UP

680
00:19:52,622 --> 00:19:54,223
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY.

681
00:19:54,223 --> 00:19:55,491
>> OH, THAT IS SO TRUE, DOUGIE.

682
00:19:55,491 --> 00:19:56,159
>> YEAH.

683
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:56,826
>> YEAH.

684
00:19:56,826 --> 00:19:57,493
>> YEAH.

685
00:19:57,493 --> 00:19:58,328
>> SO WHAT WOULD A TRUCK LIKE

686
00:19:58,328 --> 00:20:00,763
THIS COST?

687
00:20:00,763 --> 00:20:03,333
>> ABOUT $86,000.

688
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,801
$86,000.

689
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:05,735
THAT'S FULLY LOADED, THOUGH.

690
00:20:05,735 --> 00:20:07,637
I USED TO HAVE A HONDA CIVIC.

691
00:20:07,637 --> 00:20:10,273
WE TOOK HER TO THE TRACTOR AND

692
00:20:10,273 --> 00:20:11,641
TRUCK PULL THING, BUT WE DIDN'T

693
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:14,744
FARE VERY WELL AT ALL, SO I HAD

694
00:20:14,744 --> 00:20:15,545
TO GET RID OF IT.

695
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:17,647
>> YEAH, BUT, DOUGIE, THERE IS A

696
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:19,849
LOT MORE TO THIS SPORT THAN JUST

697
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:22,518
LINING UP IN FRONT OF A BUNCH OF

698
00:20:22,518 --> 00:20:25,088
OLD CARS AND FLYING THROUGH THE

699
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:26,923
AIR AND THEN COMING DOWN AND

700
00:20:26,923 --> 00:20:27,657
CRUSHING THEM.

701
00:20:27,657 --> 00:20:30,526
>> NO, NO, NO, I THINK THAT'D

702
00:20:30,526 --> 00:20:32,061
SUM HER UP IN A NUTSHELL, I

703
00:20:32,061 --> 00:20:32,995
THINK, WHAT THE SPORT'S ALL

704
00:20:32,995 --> 00:20:33,896
ABOUT.

705
00:20:33,896 --> 00:20:35,331
BUT, YOU KNOW, IF I MIGHT JUST

706
00:20:35,331 --> 00:20:38,101
GET SERIOUS FOR JUST A SECOND,

707
00:20:38,101 --> 00:20:39,902
RED, I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU

708
00:20:39,902 --> 00:20:41,170
KIDS AT HOME.

709
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,638
IF YOU KIDS AT HOME HAVE GOT AN

710
00:20:42,638 --> 00:20:44,774
OVERSIZED TRUCK WITH HUMONGO

711
00:20:44,774 --> 00:20:47,310
TIRES LIKE THIS, YOU DON'T WANT

712
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,311
TO BE TRYING THE STUFF THAT WE

713
00:20:48,311 --> 00:20:49,545
DO.

714
00:20:49,545 --> 00:20:51,981
LEAVE IT TO THE PROFESSIONALS.

715
00:20:51,981 --> 00:20:54,417
BECAUSE YOU GET INTO, LIKE, UH,

716
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:57,453
THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN TO YOUR

717
00:20:57,453 --> 00:21:00,356
HEAD, AND YOU CAN DEAL WITH SOME

718
00:21:00,356 --> 00:21:05,995
HEAD INJURIES, AND YOUR HEAD

719
00:21:05,995 --> 00:21:08,831
COULD GET, UH, YOU COULD HURT,

720
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:10,900
UH, HEADS.

721
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,768
YOU CAN GET INJURED THERE BAD.

722
00:21:12,768 --> 00:21:14,270
DID I SAY THAT?

723
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,104
I THINK I DID.

724
00:21:15,104 --> 00:21:16,672
>> I WAS JUST, WHILE YOU WERE

725
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,540
SPEAKING THERE, I WAS JUST

726
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,808
WONDERING IF MAYBE A SEATBELT

727
00:21:18,808 --> 00:21:19,775
MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA IN A SPORT

728
00:21:19,775 --> 00:21:20,710
LIKE THIS.

729
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,311
>> OH, YEAH, YOU BET YOUR BOTTOM

730
00:21:22,311 --> 00:21:23,179
DOLLAR ON THAT.

731
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:24,614
NOW, I HAVE A SEATBELT, BUT IT'S

732
00:21:24,614 --> 00:21:26,115
CRAWLED AND SNUCK BACK HERE INTO

733
00:21:26,115 --> 00:21:27,617
THE CRACK OF THIS SEAT HERE.

734
00:21:27,617 --> 00:21:29,952
AND I CAN'T GET AT IT.

735
00:21:29,952 --> 00:21:31,754
IT'S BEEN WELDED INTO, INTO

736
00:21:31,754 --> 00:21:32,521
PLACE.

737
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:33,956
I CAN'T GET AT HER.

738
00:21:33,956 --> 00:21:35,191
BUT YOU KNOW, IT'S A SAFE, IT IS

739
00:21:35,191 --> 00:21:36,726
A SAFE SPORT, RED.

740
00:21:36,726 --> 00:21:38,728
I MEAN, NOBODY IS GONNA GET

741
00:21:38,728 --> 00:21:39,428
HURT.

742
00:21:39,428 --> 00:21:40,096
>> NO.

743
00:21:40,096 --> 00:21:40,930
>> UNLESS, OF COURSE, THEY GOT

744
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,331
THEIR FACE STARING UP THE BARREL

745
00:21:42,331 --> 00:21:43,699
OF MY EXHAUST WHEN I FIRE THIS

746
00:21:43,699 --> 00:21:44,767
BABY UP.

747
00:21:44,767 --> 00:21:45,901
BOY, THAT'D SET YOU FREE, I TELL

748
00:21:45,901 --> 00:21:46,569
YOU.

749
00:21:46,569 --> 00:21:47,737
THERE'S A STORY BEHIND THAT ONE.

750
00:21:47,737 --> 00:21:48,904
>> YEAH.

751
00:21:48,904 --> 00:21:50,806
MAYBE SOME OTHER TIME, HUH?

752
00:21:50,806 --> 00:21:53,142
>> I NEVER KNEW TOUPEES COST SO

753
00:21:53,142 --> 00:21:54,410
MUCH MONEY, I'LL TELL YOU THAT

754
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,311
RIGHT NOW.

755
00:21:55,311 --> 00:21:57,346
>> THAT'S DOUGIE FRANKLIN.

756
00:21:57,346 --> 00:21:59,048
A MAN WHO'S COMBINED HIS HOBBY

757
00:21:59,048 --> 00:22:00,783
AND HIS WORK INTO ONE HUGE,

758
00:22:00,783 --> 00:22:02,652
GREAT BIG, GIGANTIC TRUCK HERE.

759
00:22:02,652 --> 00:22:03,486
>> OR THAT THEY WERE FLAMMABLE

760
00:22:03,486 --> 00:22:04,153
TOO.

761
00:22:04,153 --> 00:22:06,188
THAT SUCKER, PSHEW.

762
00:22:06,188 --> 00:22:07,023
HE WAS A CUE BALL.

763
00:22:07,023 --> 00:22:08,024
HE WAS A CUE BALL.

764
00:22:08,024 --> 00:22:09,692
UNBELIEVABLE.

765
00:22:09,692 --> 00:22:11,394
JUST, YOU KNOW, COME IN, LOOK

766
00:22:11,394 --> 00:22:12,495
LIKE TOM SELLECK, AND HE WENT

767
00:22:12,495 --> 00:22:14,463
OUT LOOKING LIKE KOJAK.

768
00:22:20,603 --> 00:22:23,339
>> SO ANYWAY, AFTER MOOSE

769
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:24,373
THOMPSON HAD SEEN THE GHOST OF

770
00:22:24,373 --> 00:22:26,308
ELVIS, IT KIND OF CHANGED HIS

771
00:22:26,308 --> 00:22:27,243
PERSONALITY.

772
00:22:27,243 --> 00:22:29,211
OR, I SHOULD SAY, IT GOT HIM A

773
00:22:29,211 --> 00:22:30,713
PERSONALITY.

774
00:22:30,713 --> 00:22:32,581
PUT RHINESTONES ALL OVER HIS

775
00:22:32,581 --> 00:22:34,483
PLAID SHIRT AND HIS HUNTING VEST

776
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:35,718
AND HIS TENT.

777
00:22:35,718 --> 00:22:38,621
AND HE WENT AROUND SAYING, "UH,

778
00:22:38,621 --> 00:22:39,789
THANKYOUVERYMUCH."

779
00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:40,923
YOU KNOW, AND

780
00:22:40,923 --> 00:22:42,191
HE BOUGHT HIS MOTHER A MOTOR

781
00:22:42,191 --> 00:22:45,094
HOME, CALLED IT "GREASELAND."

782
00:22:45,094 --> 00:22:47,062
WELL, NOW, WE TRY TO BE TOLERANT

783
00:22:47,062 --> 00:22:48,030
OF PEOPLE FOR A COUPLE OF

784
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,298
MINUTES OR SO.

785
00:22:49,298 --> 00:22:50,232
BUT THEN IT GOT TO THE POINT

786
00:22:50,232 --> 00:22:51,167
WHERE HE WAS REALLY GETTING ON

787
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:52,067
OUR NERVES.

788
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:53,903
SO WE KNOCKED HIM DOWN, STEPPED

789
00:22:53,903 --> 00:22:55,437
ON HIS FACE, AND SLANDERED HIS

790
00:22:55,437 --> 00:22:57,873
NAME ALL OVER THE PLACE.

791
00:22:57,873 --> 00:22:59,208
NOW HE THINKS HE'S MAMA CASS.

792
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:02,111
ANYWAY, IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

793
00:23:02,111 --> 00:23:02,912
I'M GONNA BE COMING STRAIGHT

794
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,181
HOME, AND I'VE DECIDED NOT TO

795
00:23:05,181 --> 00:23:06,682
PUT MY HAIR INTO A DUCKTAIL,

796
00:23:06,682 --> 00:23:07,983
BECAUSE I COULDN'T GET THE DUCK

797
00:23:07,983 --> 00:23:08,918
TO GO FOR IT.

798
00:23:08,918 --> 00:23:11,320
ANYWAY, ON BEHALF OF MYSELF

799
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,255
AND--

800
00:23:13,255 --> 00:23:14,423
>> HAROLD.

801
00:23:14,423 --> 00:23:15,424
>> YEAH, CLOSE ENOUGH, AND THE

802
00:23:15,424 --> 00:23:16,759
REST OF US UP AT THE LODGE, KEEP

803
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:20,462
YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

804
00:23:20,462 --> 00:23:23,432
[applause]

805
00:23:24,066 --> 00:23:24,967
[engine buzzing]

806
00:23:24,967 --> 00:23:26,936
ALL RIGHT. LET HER GO.

807
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:32,408
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

808
00:23:32,408 --> 00:23:34,143
NOW, THAT'S FLYING AT ITS BEST,

809
00:23:34,143 --> 00:23:35,744
ISN'T IT?

810
00:23:35,744 --> 00:23:36,712
TAKE THIS LITTLE EXTRA TIME, AND

811
00:23:36,712 --> 00:23:39,415
THE YOUNGSTERS GET TO HAVE SOME

812
00:23:39,415 --> 00:23:42,351
FUN, AND--IS IT OKAY?

813
00:23:42,351 --> 00:23:44,119
AH, IT WILL BE.

814
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:45,220
WE GOT SOME DUCT TAPE IN THE VAN

815
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:49,058
THERE AND...BOY, I'M THIRSTY.

816
00:23:49,058 --> 00:23:51,760
CLEAN THAT UP, WILL YOU, MAX?
