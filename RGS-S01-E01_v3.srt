00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:22,614
A 427 ENGINE WHICH FELL OUT OF

174
00:06:22,614 --> 00:06:23,916
A FRIEND'S CAR WHEN BUSTER

175
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:24,816
HATFIELD DID AN OIL CHANGE

176
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:26,552
ON IT.

177
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,419
THE INSURANCE PAID FOR

178
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:28,287
EVERYTHING, SO WE ENDED UP WITH

179
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:28,987
THE MOTOR.

180
00:06:28,987 --> 00:06:29,821
WE FIGURED IT WOULD BE IDEAL TO

181
00:06:29,821 --> 00:06:30,923
BUILD AN OUTBOARD AROUND THAT.

182
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,124
SO NEXT THING WE NEEDED WAS A

183
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:32,891
DRIVE SHAFT.

184
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:35,294
WE DECIDED TO USE OUR SHOWER ROD

185
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:36,662
BECAUSE WE WEREN'T USING IT

186
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:37,496
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A SHOWER

187
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:38,330
CURTAIN BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

188
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,164
SHOWERS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

189
00:06:39,164 --> 00:06:40,032
HOT WATER BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

190
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:41,900
WATER.

191
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,768
SO WHEN YOU GET A MOTOR THAT

192
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:44,136
SIZE, IT'D JUST BE WASTED ON

193
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:45,971
A NORMAL-SIZED PROP.

194
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:46,939
SO WE HAD TO THINK OF SOMETHING

195
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:47,673
A LITTLE BIGGER, LIKE

196
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,975
A CEILING FAN.

197
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:51,577
SO WE PUT A WHOLE RIG UP THERE

198
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,678
AND PUT IT ALL TOGETHER WITH THE

199
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,580
HANDYMAN'S SECRET WEAPON, DUCT

200
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,648
TAPE, AND THEN WE MOUNTED HER ON

201
00:06:56,648 --> 00:06:58,317
THE BACK OF THE ALUMINUM BOAT.

202
00:06:58,317 --> 00:06:59,685
BUT, YOU KNOW, GOLLY, THAT

203
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:00,652
WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION WAS KIND OF

204
00:07:00,652 --> 00:07:01,653
OFF ON THAT.

205
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:02,955
SO WE ENDED UP TURNING THE WHOLE

206
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,222
FRONT HALF OF THE BOAT INTO

207
00:07:04,222 --> 00:07:04,890
A GAS TANK.

208
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,391
UNCLE RED, THE NEXT SEGMENT'S

209
00:07:06,391 --> 00:07:07,192
ALL READY.

210
00:07:07,192 --> 00:07:08,593
WELL, I DON'T CARE, HAROLD.

211
00:07:08,593 --> 00:07:09,428
OH, OKAY.

212
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,396
[keyboard clacking]

213
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:13,565
WHAT'D YOU DO THAT FOR?

214
00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:14,533
WELL, YOU SAID

215
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:15,834
YOU DIDN'T CARE.

216
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:16,902
MAKE UP YOUR MIND.

217
00:07:16,902 --> 00:07:18,870
GEEZ.

218
00:07:21,206 --> 00:07:22,007
RED GREEN?

219
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:22,674
YEAH?

220
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:23,542
IS THAT REALLY YOU OR IS JUST

221
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:24,409
ANOTHER HALLUCINATION?

222
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:25,177
NO.

223
00:07:25,177 --> 00:07:26,945
NO, IT'S NOT A HALLUCINATION.

224
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:28,046
HALLUCINATIONS DON'T HAVE

225
00:07:28,046 --> 00:07:29,548
PROFESSIONAL TV CAMERAMEN

226
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:30,349
FOLLOWING THEM AROUND.

227
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,450
THAT'S RIGHT.

228
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,851
[laughter]

229
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:34,386
WELL, PLEASE EXCUSE THE MESS.

230
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:35,320
I'VE BEEN CHANGING THINGS AROUND

231
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:35,987
A LITTLE.

232
00:07:35,987 --> 00:07:36,755
YEAH, YOU HAVE CHANGED IT

233
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:37,456
A BIT HERE.

234
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:38,190
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY.

235
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:38,857
A CHANGE IS AS GOOD AS A

236
00:07:38,857 --> 00:07:39,791
VACATION, AND I HAVEN'T HAD A

237
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,126
VACATION IN 13 YEARS.

238
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:41,793
AND I FIGURED,

239
00:07:41,793 --> 00:07:42,594
WHY NOT HAVE A CHANGE?

240
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:44,196
GOSH, 13 YEARS

241
00:07:44,196 --> 00:07:45,263
WITHOUT A VACATION.

242
00:07:45,263 --> 00:07:46,431
BOY, WHAT--THAT'S SOMETHING.

243
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,399
THERE'S A WORD FOR THAT, ISN'T

244
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,333
THERE?

245
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,935
WHAT--WHAT IS IT?

246
00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:50,769
DEDICATION?

247
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:51,970
SURE.

248
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:52,704
SURE.

249
00:07:52,704 --> 00:07:53,371
YEAH, YEAH.

250
00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:56,975
DEDICATION AND LONELINESS.

251
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:57,943
[sobbing]

252
00:07:57,943 --> 00:08:01,480
OH.

253
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,214
SORRY, MAN.

254
00:08:02,214 --> 00:08:05,884
[sobbing]

255
00:08:05,884 --> 00:08:06,918
I'M SORRY.

256
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:07,652
NO, THAT'S OKAY.

257
00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:08,453
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

258
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:09,454
YOU KNOW WHAT I MISS THE

259
00:08:09,454 --> 00:08:10,255
MOST?

260
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:11,923
WHAT?

261
00:08:11,923 --> 00:08:12,757
TV.

262
00:08:12,757 --> 00:08:14,559
MY FAVORITE TV SHOWS, YOU KNOW.

263
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:15,794
LAVERNE AND SHIRLEY,

264
00:08:15,794 --> 00:08:17,762
WELCOME BACK, KOTTER;

265
00:08:17,762 --> 00:08:20,398
HAWAII FIVE-0.

266
00:08:20,398 --> 00:08:21,967
SOMETIMES I'LL ACT OUT ALL MY

267
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:23,034
FAVORITE SCENES, PLAY ALL THE

268
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:23,935
ROLES, YOU KNOW.

269
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:26,071
YEAH.

270
00:08:26,071 --> 00:08:26,905
EIGHT IS ENOUGH IS THE

271
00:08:26,905 --> 00:08:30,075
TOUGHEST.

272
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:30,775
WHAT DO YOU DO TO STOP

273
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:31,576
YOURSELF FROM GOING CRAZY

274
00:08:31,576 --> 00:08:33,011
UP HERE, GORD?

275
00:08:33,011 --> 00:08:34,246
WELL, I TRY TO KEEP MYSELF

276
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:35,046
BUSY.

277
00:08:35,046 --> 00:08:37,182
YOU KNOW, I TAKE ALL KINDS OF

278
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:38,316
CORRESPONDENCE COURSES.

279
00:08:38,316 --> 00:08:39,217
MAKES SENSE.

280
00:08:39,217 --> 00:08:40,051
YEAH.

281
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:40,785
RIGHT NOW, I'M LEARNING

282
00:08:40,785 --> 00:08:42,654
BRICKLAYING BY MAIL.

283
00:08:42,654 --> 00:08:43,855
YOU KNOW WINSTON CHURCHILL

284
00:08:43,855 --> 00:08:45,290
ENJOYED LAYING BRICKS?

285
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,091
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

286
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:46,791
YEAH.

287
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:47,492
AND I'M LEARNING A SECOND

288
00:08:47,492 --> 00:08:49,127
LANGUAGE: BEAVER.

289
00:08:49,127 --> 00:08:49,928
YEAH.

290
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:50,795
IT'S A GREAT LANGUAGE THAT I'M

291
00:08:50,795 --> 00:08:51,896
PICKING UP FROM BEAVERS DOWN BY

292
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:53,064
THE RIVER.

293
00:08:53,064 --> 00:08:53,898
OKAY.

294
00:08:53,898 --> 00:08:54,733
YEAH.

295
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:55,900
AND BEAVER'S EASIER TO LEARN

296
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,935
THAN GERMAN.

297
00:08:56,935 --> 00:08:58,937
WHEREAS GERMAN WILL HAVE THREE

298
00:08:58,937 --> 00:09:01,039
GENDERS, BEAVER ONLY HAS ONE.

299
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,173
SO IT'S A LOT LIKE ENGLISH IN

300
00:09:02,173 --> 00:09:03,241
THAT WAY.

301
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:04,175
AND A LOT OF THE WORDS ARE

302
00:09:04,175 --> 00:09:05,076
SIMILAR.

303
00:09:05,076 --> 00:09:05,777
THE BEAVER WORD FOR

304
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:06,745
THUNDERSTORM, FOR INSTANCE,

305
00:09:06,745 --> 00:09:07,412
IS...

306
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:09,247
[smacking teeth]

307
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:10,081
THAT IS CLOSE.

308
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:10,815
YEAH, DO YOU KNOW THERE

309
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:11,883
ARE OVER 40 DIFFERENT BEAVER

310
00:09:11,883 --> 00:09:14,119
WORDS FOR TREE STUMP?

311
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:15,153
GOSH, THAT'S--

312
00:09:15,153 --> 00:09:16,221
NO, IT'S A RICH LANGUAGE,

313
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:17,255
RED, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

314
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:20,825
TREES AND BARK AND RUTTING.

315
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:21,493
OR, AS WE SAY,

316
00:09:21,493 --> 00:09:23,461
[smacking teeth]

317
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:24,996
[laughs]

318
00:09:24,996 --> 00:09:26,231
HUH?

319
00:09:26,231 --> 00:09:29,300
ISN'T THAT GREAT, EH?

320
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,802
WELL, AND THE BEAVERS DON'T

321
00:09:30,802 --> 00:09:31,970
HAVE A WORD FOR TRANSMISSION.

322
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,004
NO, THEY DON'T.

323
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:34,005
BUT THEY DON'T CARE.

324
00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:34,706
NO, THEY WOULDN'T.

325
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:35,373
NO.

326
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:36,274
LIKE, THE BEAVERS HAVE A SAYING.

327
00:09:36,274 --> 00:09:40,211
[smacking teeth]

328
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:41,713
WHAT DOES THAT TRANSLATE AS?

329
00:09:41,713 --> 00:09:42,514
LET'S CHOP DOWN THIS TREE

330
00:09:42,514 --> 00:09:44,849
AND DRAG IT TO THE RIVER.

331
00:09:44,849 --> 00:09:45,650
OKAY, GORD, I THINK WE'VE

332
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,417
GOT TO GET GOING HERE.

333
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:47,252
BUT THANKS A LOT FOR YOUR TIME.

334
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:48,052
WE WANT TO GET YOU BACK

335
00:09:48,052 --> 00:09:48,720
TO YOUR WORK.

336
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,721
>>PLEASE DON'T--PLEASE DON'T GO.

337
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:50,588
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

338
00:09:50,588 --> 00:09:53,525
WE'LL COME BACK ANOTHER TIME.

339
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:54,692
OKAY.

340
00:09:54,692 --> 00:09:55,693
HOW ABOUT SATURDAY, THEN?

341
00:09:55,693 --> 00:09:56,361
HUH?

342
00:09:56,361 --> 00:09:57,028
WELL, WE'LL SEE.

343
00:09:57,028 --> 00:09:57,695
YEAH?

344
00:09:57,695 --> 00:09:59,264

OKAY?

348
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:02,233
ALL RIGHT.

349
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:02,934
JUST SLAP YOUR TAIL ON THE

350
00:10:02,934 --> 00:10:03,968

351
00:10:03,968 --> 00:10:04,836

IN THE SUMMERTIME

358
00:10:13,545 --> 00:10:14,546

THE MERCY BOG JIG

366
00:10:24,088 --> 00:10:25,023
THERE'S NEVER BEEN A DANCE

367

NEVER, NEVER

369
00:10:26,991 --> 00:10:28,359
YOU DON'T NEED LESSONS

370
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:29,727
JUST JOIN RIGHT IN

371

373
00:10:38,803 --> 00:10:39,837

376
00:10:41,205 --> 00:10:41,940
IT'S MALE BAG TIME.

377
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,141
YOU KNOW, BUT I FOUND THE

378
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:44,909
LETTERS A TAD REPETITIVE BASED

379
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:45,944

00:10:45,944 --> 00:10:48,780
YOU KNOW, WE'RE SKEWING 40-PLUS.

381
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,048
SO I SELECTED SOME LETTERS FROM

WE DON'T HAVE TO.

387
00:10:58,456 --> 00:10:59,257
JUST READ THE LETTERS,

388
00:10:59,257 --> 00:11:01,292

00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:27,819
OH, A DOOFUS IS LIKE A STUD,

00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:30,354
LIKE A REALLY COOL-LOOKING GUY.

DOOFUS.

411
00:11:31,456 --> 00:11:33,791
OKAY, WELL, AMANDA, I DON'T

412
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:34,759
KNOW IF THERE WAS A QUESTION IN

413
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:35,426
YOUR LETTER.

414
00:11:35,426 --> 00:11:36,360
I CERTAINLY DIDN'T HEAR ONE.

415
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,329
BUT IF THERE WAS,

416
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:39,664
THE ANSWER IS NO.

417
00:11:39,664 --> 00:11:40,598
THAT'S EXCELLENT.

PORTAGE A CANOE.

454
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:43,461
BUT OF COURSE FIRST, WE HAD TO--

455
00:12:43,461 --> 00:12:45,563
[clearing throat]

456
00:12:45,563 --> 00:12:46,597
FIRST WE HAD TO LAND THE CANOE

457
00:12:46,597 --> 00:12:48,165
BEFORE YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO THE

458
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:50,234
PORTAGING.

459
00:12:50,234 --> 00:12:54,839
SO LUCKILY BILL HAD THE ROPE.

460
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,407
MAYBE HE SHOULD HAVE

461
00:12:56,407 --> 00:13:00,378
UNTANGLED THAT.

462
00:13:00,378 --> 00:13:01,345
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE HAD IN MIND

463
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:02,413
THERE.

464
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:03,681
I TRIED TO PADDLE THE DOCK OUT

465
00:13:03,681 --> 00:13:05,416
TO BILL AS HE BRINGING

466
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,051
THE CANOE IN.

467
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:08,786
GOD, IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

468
00:13:08,786 --> 00:13:09,820
OH, WE JUST FINALLY JUST GOT HIM

469
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,422
UP THERE SOMEHOW, I GUESS.

470
00:13:11,422 --> 00:13:12,323
HE TRIED TO PULL HER UP

471
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:13,224
THIS WAY.

472
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:14,892
NOW, INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, WATER

473
00:13:14,892 --> 00:13:16,160
GOES INTO THE BACK OF THE CANOE

474
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,696
AND, BY GOD, SHE GETS KIND OF

475
00:13:18,696 --> 00:13:22,366
HEAVY.

476
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:23,434
I'VE GOT TO HAND IT TO BILL

477
00:13:23,434 --> 00:13:24,268
BECAUSE YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW

478
00:13:24,268 --> 00:13:25,770
WHAT'S IN THAT WATER.

479
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,872
I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF DEAD

480
00:13:27,872 --> 00:13:29,573
CATTLE IN THERE AND SOME

481
00:13:29,573 --> 00:13:32,309
VEHICLES AND I THINK A COUPLE OF

482
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:33,210
OLD LODGE MEMBERS ARE DOWN

483
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:33,878
THERE.

484
00:13:33,878 --> 00:13:35,513
ANYWAY, WE EVENTUALLY

485
00:13:35,513 --> 00:13:36,247
GOT HER UP.

486
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:37,281
I THOUGHT WE WOULD JUST PULL IT

487
00:13:37,281 --> 00:13:38,182
RIGHT UP ON THE DOCK FROM THE

488
00:13:38,182 --> 00:13:39,483
SIDE, LITTLE DIFFERENT ANGLE,

489
00:13:39,483 --> 00:13:40,951
AND THEN WE'D HAVE TO WORK

490
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:42,920
WITH--WELL--

491
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,393
MAYBE A LITTLE WIDER DOCK MIGHT

492
00:13:49,393 --> 00:13:51,996
HAVE BEEN--ANYWAY WE DECIDED

493
00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:53,764
BILL WOULD JUST PADDLE THE CANOE

494
00:13:53,764 --> 00:13:55,633
UP TO THE BEACH AREA AND FORGET

495
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:56,800
ABOUT THE DOCK FOR THE TIME

496
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,601
BEING.

497
00:13:57,601 --> 00:13:58,736
YOU KNOW, THE BOTTOM'S GOT A LOT

498
00:13:58,736 --> 00:14:01,972
OF SPONGY, STICKY KIND OF--

499
00:14:01,972 --> 00:14:02,740
YEAH.

500
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,507
[clears throat]

501
00:14:03,507 --> 00:14:04,375
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT

502
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,309
CAN HAPPEN.

503
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:07,111
ANYWAY, LUCKILY WE HAVE 700 OR

504
00:14:07,111 --> 00:14:07,978
800 PADDLES.

505
00:14:07,978 --> 00:14:10,948
YEAH, BILL.

506
00:14:10,948 --> 00:14:11,815
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA SEE

507
00:14:11,815 --> 00:14:14,251
THAT ONE AGAIN.

508
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:15,486
BUT HE GOT HER UP

509
00:14:15,486 --> 00:14:17,454
MUCH FURTHER.

510
00:14:19,823 --> 00:14:20,858
KIND OF AN INTERESTING

511
00:14:20,858 --> 00:14:25,029
TECHNIQUE.

512
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:26,196
BILL AND I JUST KIND OF GET

513
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:27,598
FIXING THERE, YOU KNOW.

514
00:14:27,598 --> 00:14:29,566
SO NOW TO GET READY FOR THE

515
00:14:29,566 --> 00:14:31,335
PORTAGE, WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO

516
00:14:31,335 --> 00:14:32,202
IS, YOU'VE GOT TO--YOU SEE WHAT

517
00:14:32,202 --> 00:14:33,170
HE'S SAYING THERE IS, YOU'VE GOT

518
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:33,937
TO PICK THE CANOE UP.

519
00:14:33,937 --> 00:14:35,873
SO I'M GOING TO HELP HIM PICK

520
00:14:35,873 --> 00:14:39,143
THIS THING UP.

521
00:14:39,143 --> 00:14:41,078
TRYING TO GET STUFF IN THERE,

522
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:42,046
YOU KNOW.

523
00:14:42,046 --> 00:14:46,050
BUT OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH.

524
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,018
OH.

525
00:14:49,086 --> 00:14:50,788
WELL, HE'S ALL RIGHT.

526
00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:52,690
SO NEXT THING WE DO IS, WE'RE

527
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:53,490
GOING TO PICK IT UP FROM THE

528
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,125
SIDE RATHER THAN FROM THE END,

529
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,026
AND WE'VE GOT A LOT OF THE CRAP

530
00:14:56,026 --> 00:14:57,394
OUT OF THERE.

531
00:14:57,394 --> 00:15:01,031
OH, BILL.

532
00:15:01,031 --> 00:15:04,868
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE JUST NOT

533
00:15:04,868 --> 00:15:05,803
MAKING THE CANOES THE WAY THEY

534
00:15:05,803 --> 00:15:06,470
USED TO.

535
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,738
THEY'RE A LOT STRONGER NOW.

536
00:15:07,738 --> 00:15:09,640
YOUR OLD BIRCH BARK THERE WOULD

537
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,108
JUST, I THINK, COLLAPSE UNDER

538
00:15:11,108 --> 00:15:11,975
THAT KIND OF STRAIN.

539
00:15:11,975 --> 00:15:13,210
BUT IT'S GOT THE ALUMINUM OVER

540
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,447
THE FIBERGLASS.

541
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:17,347
YOU KNOW, BILL WILL VOUCH FOR

542
00:15:17,347 --> 00:15:18,449
THE STRENGTH OF THESE THINGS.

543
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:19,817
ANYWAY, YOU KNOW, HE'S GOT A LOT

544
00:15:19,817 --> 00:15:21,318
OF RECUPERATIVE POWERS.

545
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:22,686
AND WE GET THE CANOE UP ONTO HIS

546
00:15:22,686 --> 00:15:25,222
HEAD THERE AND, OF COURSE,

547
00:15:25,222 --> 00:15:26,190
THE PROBLEM NOW IS, HE CAN'T SEE

548
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,325
WHICH WAY THE WATER IS,

549
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:28,992
YOU KNOW.

550
00:15:28,992 --> 00:15:31,161
I'M TRYING TO DIRECT HIM,

551
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:32,496
YOU KNOW, BACK THAT WAY, BILL,

552
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:33,397
KIND OF DEAL.

553
00:15:33,397 --> 00:15:35,232
IT WAS A LOT OF FUN--

554
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:38,068
DANGEROUS, DANGEROUS, BUT FUN.

555
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:39,937
IT IS WINTER.

556
00:15:39,937 --> 00:15:41,772
DOWN THE HILL YOU RACE, FLAT ON

557
00:15:41,772 --> 00:15:43,807
YOUR BACK, SCREAMING, EYES

558
00:15:43,807 --> 00:15:46,276
CLOSED, ON A TOBOGGAN.

559
00:15:46,276 --> 00:15:48,178
UP THE HILL YOU GO, FLAT ON YOUR

560
00:15:48,178 --> 00:15:50,681
BACK, SCREAMING, EYES CLOSED,

561
00:15:50,681 --> 00:15:52,649
ON A STRETCHER.

562
00:16:04,294 --> 00:16:06,463
IN THIS PART OF THE SHOW, I GIVE

563
00:16:06,463 --> 00:16:08,031
HAROLD A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT

564
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:08,899
THE THINGS THAT ARE BOTHERING

565
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:10,267
YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY SEEM

566
00:16:10,267 --> 00:16:11,768
TO TRUST HIM OR AT LEAST NOT

567
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:12,736
FEEL THREATENED BY HIM.

568
00:16:12,736 --> 00:16:14,104
HAROLD?

569
00:16:14,104 --> 00:16:15,539
WHAT?

570
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:16,640
OH, YEAH, OKAY.

571
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,674
[laughs]

572
00:16:17,674 --> 00:16:19,743
OKAY, SEX EDUCATION.

573
00:16:19,743 --> 00:16:21,311
[moos]

574
00:16:21,311 --> 00:16:22,212
YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET THE KIDS

575
00:16:22,212 --> 00:16:23,480
OUT OF THE ROOM OR, LIKE, YOU

576
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,514
KNOW, MAKE CLEARING YOUR THROAT

577
00:16:24,514 --> 00:16:25,782
NOISES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

578
00:16:25,782 --> 00:16:26,783
ASK THEM HOW SCHOOL WENT.

579
00:16:26,783 --> 00:16:29,152
GET THEM DISTRACTED, RIGHT?

580
00:16:29,152 --> 00:16:30,087
OKAY?

581
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:30,988
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

582
00:16:30,988 --> 00:16:32,289
SEX EDUCATION.

583
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:33,156
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ALL MODERN

584
00:16:33,156 --> 00:16:34,124
ABOUT IT AND STUFF, BECAUSE

585
00:16:34,124 --> 00:16:38,028
IT'S, LIKE, THE '90s, RIGHT?

586
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:40,530
YEAH, IT IS.

587
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,798
OKAY.

588
00:16:41,798 --> 00:16:42,799
SO IN SCHOOL, RIGHT?

589
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:43,467
THEY TEACH US, LIKE,

590
00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:44,434
DON'T BE ASHAMED.

591
00:16:44,434 --> 00:16:45,469
DON'T BE EMBARRASSED BY IT

592
00:16:45,469 --> 00:16:46,169
OR NOTHING.

593
00:16:46,169 --> 00:16:46,937
YOU KNOW, IT'S OKAY.

594
00:16:46,937 --> 00:16:47,671
IT'S NATURAL.

595
00:16:47,671 --> 00:16:49,072
BUT YET OUR PARENTS WON'T EVEN

596
00:16:49,072 --> 00:16:50,240
TALK ABOUT IT WITH US,

597
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,441
AND WE KNOW THEY DO.

598
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:52,843
WE KNOW BECAUSE, LIKE, EVERY

599
00:16:52,843 --> 00:16:54,711
TIME THEY HAVE AN ANNIVERSARY,

600
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:55,812
THEY SEND THE KIDS TO THE MOVIES

601
00:16:55,812 --> 00:16:56,613
FOR THE NIGHT.

602
00:16:56,613 --> 00:16:58,014
THEY DON'T EVER DO THAT, RIGHT?

603
00:16:58,014 --> 00:16:58,882
SO WE KNOW.

604
00:16:58,882 --> 00:16:59,816
WE KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

605
00:16:59,816 --> 00:17:00,484
WE KNOW.

606
00:17:00,484 --> 00:17:01,685
WE DO.

607
00:17:01,685 --> 00:17:02,753
AND THEY TEAR ALL THE GOOD

608
00:17:02,753 --> 00:17:03,587
ARTICLES OUT OF THE READER'S

609
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:04,721
DIGEST BEFORE WE GET A CHANCE

610
00:17:04,721 --> 00:17:05,555
TO READ THEM.

611
00:17:05,555 --> 00:17:06,690
REAL GOOD ONE LIKE

612
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:10,327
I WAS JOE'S PROSTATE.

613
00:17:10,327 --> 00:17:12,162
THAT'S A GOOD ONE TOO.

614
00:17:12,162 --> 00:17:13,997
SO MY POINT IS, I JUST WANT TO

615
00:17:13,997 --> 00:17:16,333
SAY THAT I'M GLAD I'M NOT LIKE

616
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,668
ADULTS AND HAVE HANG-UPS ABOUT,

617
00:17:18,668 --> 00:17:22,606
WELL--WELL, YOU KNOW.

618
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:24,574
[laughs]

619
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:27,310
DON'T GO AWAY.

620
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,678
I CAN'T WAIT TO FINISH MY STORY

621
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:29,946
ABOUT THE OUTBOARD MOTOR.

622
00:17:29,946 --> 00:17:30,714
I'LL MAKE SURE

623
00:17:30,714 --> 00:17:33,216
THAT HE HAS TO.

624
00:17:33,216 --> 00:17:34,618
[singing] STAYING ALIVE

625
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:35,585
[singing] STAYING ALIVE

626
00:17:35,585 --> 00:17:37,554
[singing] OOH, OOH, OOH, OOH

627
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:42,158
WELL, THIS IS CERTAINLY ONE

628
00:17:42,158 --> 00:17:44,995
OF MY FAVORITE ASPECTS OF BEING

629
00:17:44,995 --> 00:17:46,963
A HUMAN BEING, AND THAT IS, YOU

630
00:17:46,963 --> 00:17:47,964
KNOW, NOT TO BE QUITE SO

631
00:17:47,964 --> 00:17:49,499
SELFISH AND NOT TO JUST THINK OF

632
00:17:49,499 --> 00:17:50,767
YOURSELF AND SPENDING TIME WITH

633
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:51,935
PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELF IF THERE

634
00:17:51,935 --> 00:17:53,270
HAPPEN TO BE ANY

635
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,804
BUT TO ACTUALLY TAKE SOME TIME

636
00:17:54,804 --> 00:17:56,273
AND SPEND SOME OF YOUR VALUABLE

637
00:17:56,273 --> 00:17:57,707
TIME WITH SOME OF THE YOUNG

638
00:17:57,707 --> 00:17:59,542
PEOPLE, SOME OF THE GREAT, GREAT

639
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:01,578
YOUNG PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY.

640
00:18:01,578 --> 00:18:03,313
MAYBE YOU HAVE A NEPHEW--

641
00:18:03,313 --> 00:18:05,315
HOPEFULLY NOT LIKE HAROLD--

642
00:18:05,315 --> 00:18:06,049
MAYBE THERE'S A KID DOWN

643
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:07,350
THE STREET OR, YOU KNOW,

644
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,351
MAYBE JUST YOU GET INVOLVED

645
00:18:08,351 --> 00:18:09,286
WITH THE BIG BROTHERS

646
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:11,588
OR WHATEVER OR MAYBE YOU JUST,

647
00:18:11,588 --> 00:18:12,589
YOU KNOW, HAD THE BAD LUCK

648
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:13,623
TO HAVE YOUR OWN KIDS.

649
00:18:13,623 --> 00:18:15,625
WHATEVER IT IS.

650
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,294
I HAVE MY FRIEND HERE--

651
00:18:17,294 --> 00:18:18,028
DAVID.

652
00:18:18,028 --> 00:18:18,828
DAVID.

653
00:18:18,828 --> 00:18:20,330
AND DAVID AND I ARE GONNA DO

654
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,598
SOMETHING TOGETHER TODAY

655
00:18:21,598 --> 00:18:22,766
JUST, YOU KNOW, BUDS.

656
00:18:22,766 --> 00:18:23,600
WE CALL IT BUDS, HUH?

657
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,434
HUH?

658
00:18:24,434 --> 00:18:25,468
YEAH.

659
00:18:25,468 --> 00:18:26,302
YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO

660
00:18:26,302 --> 00:18:27,003
TODAY, DAVID?

661
00:18:27,003 --> 00:18:27,804
WE'RE GONNA PLAY A GAME OF

662
00:18:27,804 --> 00:18:28,505
CROQUET.

663
00:18:28,505 --> 00:18:29,205
YOU KNOW WHAT CROQUET IS?

664
00:18:29,205 --> 00:18:30,340
NO, NOT REALLY.

665
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,541
OH, WELL, NOW, THIS IS A

666
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,076
THRILL FOR ME BECAUSE NOT ONLY

667
00:18:33,076 --> 00:18:34,377
AM I SPENDING SOME TIME, I'M

668
00:18:34,377 --> 00:18:35,779
TEACHING HIM A NEW TYPE OF SPORT

669
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:38,248
THAT OBVIOUSLY DAVID OTHERWISE

670
00:18:38,248 --> 00:18:39,816
WOULD NEVER BE EXPOSED TO.

671
00:18:39,816 --> 00:18:42,052
DAVID, THE GAME OF CROQUET IS,

672
00:18:42,052 --> 00:18:43,353
YOU PUT THESE LITTLE METAL HOOPS

673
00:18:43,353 --> 00:18:44,954
INTO THE LAWN AND THEN YOU HAVE

674
00:18:44,954 --> 00:18:45,755
MALLETS AND YOU KNOCK BALLS

675
00:18:45,755 --> 00:18:47,123
THROUGH THE HOOPS.

676
00:18:47,123 --> 00:18:48,758
IT'S AN AWFUL LOT OF FUN, AND

677
00:18:48,758 --> 00:18:50,126
YOU CAN HIT THE OTHER PERSON'S

678
00:18:50,126 --> 00:18:51,761
BALL, AND YOU CAN JUST KNOCK THE

679
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:53,029
LIVING BEJEEBERS OUT OF IT AND

680
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:54,397
SMASH IT TO BITS IF YOU WANT,

681
00:18:54,397 --> 00:18:55,532
YOU KNOW.

682
00:18:55,532 --> 00:18:58,368
SOUNDS LIKE YOUR KIND OF GAME.

683
00:18:58,368 --> 00:19:00,370
YOU KNOW, GOLLY, THE PROBLEM

684
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,972
WE'RE GONNA HAVE HERE, DAVE, IS,

685
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:04,841
I BELIEVE THIS GRASS MAY JUST BE

686
00:19:04,841 --> 00:19:06,976
A TAD LONG FOR A REAL GOOD GAME

687
00:19:06,976 --> 00:19:07,777
OF CROQUET.

688
00:19:07,777 --> 00:19:09,112
AND IF WE'RE GONNA PLAY CROQUET,

689
00:19:09,112 --> 00:19:09,979
WE MIGHT AS WELL PLAY A GOOD

690
00:19:09,979 --> 00:19:10,814
ROUND OF CROQUET, RIGHT?

691
00:19:10,814 --> 00:19:11,514
YEAH.

692
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:12,248
SO YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED?

693
00:19:12,248 --> 00:19:13,750
WHAT?

694
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,718
ONE OF THESE.

695
00:19:15,718 --> 00:19:17,687
WATCH YOUR FEET THERE.

696
00:19:28,698 --> 00:19:29,766
YOU WANT TO PUSH IT ALONG WHILE

697
00:19:29,766 --> 00:19:30,667
I'M DOING THIS, AND WE'LL GET

698
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:32,635
THE LAWN CUT?

699
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:39,008
[lawn mower whirring]

700
00:19:41,511 --> 00:19:43,479
ALL RIGHT, THERE YOU GO.

701
00:19:49,185 --> 00:19:51,721
SO THE BEAUTY OF IT IS,

702
00:19:51,721 --> 00:19:52,689
YOU'RE SPENDING TIME WITH

703
00:19:52,689 --> 00:19:53,489
A YOUNG PERSON.

704
00:19:53,489 --> 00:19:54,624
THEY'RE LEARNING

705
00:19:54,624 --> 00:19:56,593
A WHOLE NEW GAME.

706
00:20:00,763 --> 00:20:01,597
OH, GOD.

707
00:20:01,597 --> 00:20:02,298
HE'S GONNA BE ALL DAY

708
00:20:02,298 --> 00:20:04,267
DOING THAT.

709
00:20:05,868 --> 00:20:06,803
I'M THINKING I GOT TO GET A NEW

710
00:20:06,803 --> 00:20:07,971
OUTBOARD MOTOR.

711
00:20:07,971 --> 00:20:09,973
THIS ONE KIND OF SMELLS.

712
00:20:09,973 --> 00:20:10,773
IS THAT OIL?

713
00:20:10,773 --> 00:20:12,475
IS THAT OIL I SMELL IN THAT?

714
00:20:12,475 --> 00:20:13,476
DON'T ASK ME, RED.

715
00:20:13,476 --> 00:20:15,244
I LOST MY SENSE OF SMELL FOR OIL

716
00:20:15,244 --> 00:20:15,945
WHEN I WORKED ON THAT

717
00:20:15,945 --> 00:20:17,280
OFFSHORE RIG.

718
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,014
YOU WORKED ON ONE OF THEM

719
00:20:18,014 --> 00:20:18,815
OIL RIGS?

720
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,216
BOY, THOSE THINGS ARE HUGE,

721
00:20:20,216 --> 00:20:21,117
AREN'T THEY?

722
00:20:21,117 --> 00:20:24,354
8 1/2 TRILLION TONS.

723
00:20:24,354 --> 00:20:25,021
REALLY?

724
00:20:25,021 --> 00:20:26,155
TRILLION?

725
00:20:26,155 --> 00:20:26,889
AND WE WEREN'T DRILLING

726
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:27,557
FOR OIL.

727
00:20:27,557 --> 00:20:29,826
WE WERE DRILLING FOR GUNPOWDER.

728
00:20:29,826 --> 00:20:30,593
WELL, THAT'D BE A LITTLE

729
00:20:30,593 --> 00:20:31,394
DANGEROUS, WOULDN'T IT?

730
00:20:31,394 --> 00:20:32,562
DRILLING FOR GUNPOWDER?

731
00:20:32,562 --> 00:20:33,629
WELL, THE WATER HELPS, AND

732
00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:35,031
IT'S UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE.

733
00:20:35,031 --> 00:20:35,798
THIS WAS A DEEP PART

734
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:36,766
OF THE OCEAN.

735
00:20:36,766 --> 00:20:39,502
I'D SAY MAYBE, OH, 20,000

736
00:20:39,502 --> 00:20:41,270
LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA.

737
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,506
THAT'S DEEP.

738
00:20:43,506 --> 00:20:44,941
WELL, NEVER FIGURE IT OUT.

739
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:46,409
A LEAGUE IS OVER SIX FEET.

740
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:49,612
NO, THAT'S A FATHOM.

741
00:20:49,612 --> 00:20:50,880
[chuckles]

742
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,448
RED, A LEAGUE IS

743
00:20:52,448 --> 00:20:55,184
A METRIC FATHOM.

744
00:20:55,184 --> 00:20:56,185
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT, HAP?

745
00:20:56,185 --> 00:20:58,521
I NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE.

746
00:20:58,521 --> 00:21:00,123
ANYWAY, ONE DAY I WAS RUNNING

747
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:00,823
THE DRILL.

748
00:21:00,823 --> 00:21:03,659
WE HAD MAYBE 21,000 LEAGUES OF

749
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:05,695
PIPE GOING STRAIGHT DOWN, AND I

750
00:21:05,695 --> 00:21:06,963
HIT THE MOTHER LODE, PURE

751
00:21:06,963 --> 00:21:08,297
GUNPOWDER.

752
00:21:08,297 --> 00:21:09,665
AND SHE BLEW.

753
00:21:09,665 --> 00:21:10,333
BOOM.

754
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,368
NOT COMPLETELY, BUT BIG.

755
00:21:12,368 --> 00:21:14,537
THAT PIPE BLEW STRAIGHT UP.

756
00:21:14,537 --> 00:21:17,306
21,000 LEAGUES OF PIPE SHOT

757
00:21:17,306 --> 00:21:19,208
STRAIGHT UP AND OUT INTO SPACE.

758
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,610
TRAVELING EVEN 15 TIMES THE

759
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,211
SPEED OF SOUND, IT TOOK 9

760
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:23,946
MINUTES FOR THE END OF THAT PIPE

761
00:21:23,946 --> 00:21:26,415
TO PASS BY ME.

762
00:21:26,415 --> 00:21:27,550
NOISY?

763
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,685
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE THE RACKET.

764
00:21:29,685 --> 00:21:31,587
AFTER THAT, GUNPOWDER MINING WAS

765
00:21:31,587 --> 00:21:33,923
DECLARED UNSAFE.

766
00:21:33,923 --> 00:21:34,724
WHERE'D THE PIPELINE

767
00:21:34,724 --> 00:21:37,260
COME DOWN?

768
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,396
MARS.

769
00:21:40,396 --> 00:21:42,531
NOTHING PERSONAL, HAP, BUT

770
00:21:42,531 --> 00:21:43,366
I'M HAVING A REAL PROBLEM

771
00:21:43,366 --> 00:21:46,502
BELIEVING THIS STORY.

772
00:21:46,502 --> 00:21:47,703
DOESN'T BOTHER ME IF YOU

773
00:21:47,703 --> 00:21:49,272
BELIEVE IT OR YOU DON'T.

774
00:21:49,272 --> 00:21:50,940
YOU WEREN'T THERE.

775
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,974
NO, BUT AT LEAST I'M WILLING

776
00:21:51,974 --> 00:21:53,943
TO ADMIT IT.

777
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:05,554
SO AS I WAS SAYING, WE GOT THE

778
00:22:05,554 --> 00:22:07,056
OUTBOARD MOTOR ALL MOUNTED ON

779
00:22:07,056 --> 00:22:08,758
THERE, AND WE GOT THE BOAT ALL

780
00:22:08,758 --> 00:22:10,292
GASSED UP AND EVERYTHING,

781
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:12,561
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT WAS STILL TOO

782
00:22:12,561 --> 00:22:13,729
HEAVY AT THE BACK END,

783
00:22:13,729 --> 00:22:15,398
SO WE PUT MOOSE THOMPSON

784
00:22:15,398 --> 00:22:16,065
IN THERE.

785
00:22:16,065 --> 00:22:17,566
BUT THEN ALL THE WEIGHT WAS UP

786
00:22:17,566 --> 00:22:18,901
AT THE FRONT, AS IT IS

787
00:22:18,901 --> 00:22:20,669
ON MOOSE TOO.

788
00:22:20,669 --> 00:22:22,471
SO IT TURNED OUT THAT BUSTER

789
00:22:22,471 --> 00:22:23,873
HATFIELD HAD TO BE

790
00:22:23,873 --> 00:22:24,774
OUR TEST PILOT.

791
00:22:24,774 --> 00:22:26,042
SO HE GOT IN THERE, AND WE KIND

792
00:22:26,042 --> 00:22:27,610
OF POINTED THE BOAT OUT TOWARDS

793
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:28,577
THE CENTER OF THE LAKE.

794
00:22:28,577 --> 00:22:29,612
IT TOOK US A WHILE TO GET IT

795
00:22:29,612 --> 00:22:32,548
GOING, THOUGH, BECAUSE A 427 V8

796
00:22:32,548 --> 00:22:33,449
IS NOT ALL THAT EASY TO

797
00:22:33,449 --> 00:22:35,151
PULL-START.

798
00:22:35,151 --> 00:22:36,752
BUT WE DID GET HER GOING.

799
00:22:36,752 --> 00:22:39,155
AND BUSTER HIT THE THROTTLE,

800
00:22:39,155 --> 00:22:41,157
AND IT BROKE OFF RIGHT IN HIS

801
00:22:41,157 --> 00:22:42,024
HAND, YOU KNOW.

802
00:22:42,024 --> 00:22:43,359
BUT NOT BEFORE IT HAD JAMMED

803
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:45,361
WIDE OPEN.

804
00:22:45,361 --> 00:22:46,495
SO IT WAS, I GUESS, ABOUT

805
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:48,130
THREE SECONDS THAT MOTOR WAS

806
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,665
DOING 80 MILES AN HOUR.

807
00:22:49,665 --> 00:22:51,467
UNFORTUNATELY, THE BOAT WAS ONLY

808
00:22:51,467 --> 00:22:53,536
DOING 75.

809
00:22:53,536 --> 00:22:55,571
SO SHE BROKE OFF THROUGH THE

810
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:56,939
TRANSOM AND STARTED TO WORK HER

811
00:22:56,939 --> 00:22:57,973
WAY UP, YOU KNOW, THROUGH THE

812
00:22:57,973 --> 00:23:01,043
BOAT, UP OVER THE SEATS, AND IN

813
00:23:01,043 --> 00:23:03,112
BETWEEN BUSTER'S LEGS AND SO ON.

814
00:23:03,112 --> 00:23:05,147
AND, GOLLY, IT WAS REALLY

815
00:23:05,147 --> 00:23:05,881
SOMETHING.

816
00:23:05,881 --> 00:23:06,916
IT TURNED OUT, YOU KNOW,

817
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:08,817
LUCKILY, THAT BUSTER'D ONLY

818
00:23:08,817 --> 00:23:10,920
DAMAGED HIS PRIDE, OR I SHOULD

819
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,122
SAY HIS PRIDE AND JOY.

820
00:23:13,122 --> 00:23:14,523
HE TRIED TO JUMP OVER

821
00:23:14,523 --> 00:23:16,258
THE SPINNING BLADES, AND, GOLLY,

822
00:23:16,258 --> 00:23:17,459
HE ONLY MISSED BY A HAIR.

823
00:23:17,459 --> 00:23:20,262
BUT ANYWAY, IF MY WIFE IS

824
00:23:20,262 --> 00:23:23,032
WATCHING, I'LL BE COMING HOME.

825
00:23:23,032 --> 00:23:23,999
BUT I THINK I'M GONNA STAY UP

826
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:25,100
AND READ A LITTLE BIT TONIGHT,

827
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:25,868
SO MAYBE YOU COULD LEAVE THE

828
00:23:25,868 --> 00:23:28,003
COMIC SECTION ON THE FRIDGE.

829
00:23:28,003 --> 00:23:29,171
ANYWAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

830
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:30,039
TUNING US IN.
