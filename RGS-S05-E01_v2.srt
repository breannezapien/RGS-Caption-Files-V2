1
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:08,274
(Chainsaw revving)

2
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,510
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

3
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,512
NOW, HERE'S THE MAN WHO SAID,

4
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:15,582
"STOP THE WORLD --
I WANT TO GET A HOT DOG!",

5
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,117
YOUR HOST, MY UNCLE...

6
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,886
RED GREEN

7
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:23,790
(Applause and cheering)

8
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,291
(Whistling)

9
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,993
(Singing)

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,595
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

11
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:30,096
THANKS FOR COMING.

12
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:33,800
THIS IS AN EXCITING TIME
AT POSSUM LODGE THIS WEEK

13
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,769
BECAUSE TONIGHT IS
MEN'S NIGHT ON THE MOUNTAIN.

14
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:38,538
HAS ANYBODY TOLD THE MOUNTAIN?

15
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,106
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.

16
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,908
THIS IS A FANTASTIC TIME.

17
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,409
IT'S TIME TO CUT LOOSE.

18
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:45,044
WE FORGET OUR REONSIBILITIES

19
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:46,846
AND GO RIGHT UP THE MOUNTAIN.

20
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,815
REAL OLD TRADITION --
DATES BACK

21
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,351
HUNDREDS OF YEARS WHEN,
IN THE SPRING,

22
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:54,854
MEN WOULD GO UP ON TOP
AND WATCH OUT OVER THE RIVERS

23
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:57,090
TO MAKE SURE
THERE WAS NO FLOODING

24
00:00:57,156 --> 00:00:58,658
FROM THE SPRING RUNOFF.

25
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,927
THERE'S A MALE BONDING SIDE
TO IT.

26
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,996
IT'S JUST MEN
UP ON THE MOUNTAIN,

27
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:05,164
LOOKING OUT OVER
A RAGING RIVER.

28
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,633
IT'S A BUNCH OF YOU GUYS,

29
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:09,736
SITTING ON ROCK REEF POINT,
STARING AT MERCURY CREEK?

30
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:15,074
NOT A REAL MOUNTAIN,
NOT A REAL RIVER, NOT REAL MEN.

31
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:18,044
ALL RIGHT, HAROLD,
IF IT'S NOT REAL MEN,

32
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,413
I GUESS YOU'LL BE ABLE TO COME.

33
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,748
REALLY? YEAH, REALLY?

34
00:01:21,814 --> 00:01:23,082
I CAN GO?

35
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:24,417
WELL, OK, ALL RIGHT.

36
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,452
MY USUAL DISDAIN
FOR YOUR DESTRUCTIVE

37
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,087
TESTOSTERONE-INDUCED
CRAZINESSES

38
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,455
SEEMS TO BE OVERRIDDEN

39
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:32,358
BY MY INCREDIBLE DESIRE
TO BE ACCEPTED BY THE GROUP.

40
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,094
MAYBE YOU ARE A REAL MAN.

41
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:37,063
PUT THIS ON.

42
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,665
(Applause)

43
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:43,603
(Horns honking)

44
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,873
(Quacking)

45
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:55,782
(Red): WE GOT
SOME NEW STUFF TO SHOW YOU.

46
00:01:55,848 --> 00:01:57,850
GARTH HARBLE, ANIMAL CONTROL.

47
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,887
I'M GONNA MAKE SOMETHING
OUT OF A SHOPPING CART.

48
00:02:00,953 --> 00:02:04,924
WE GOT A NEW GAME CALLED
"TWO ON A MATCH" YOU'LL ENJOY.

49
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:07,126
DON'T FORGET, IT'S MEN'S NIGHT
ON THE MOUNTAIN.

50
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:15,935
MEN'S NIGHT ON THE MOUNTAIN
WAS A HUGE SUCCESS, AS USUAL.

51
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:19,172
HARD ON THE BACK,
BUT I'M NOT AS YOUNG AS I WAS.

52
00:02:19,238 --> 00:02:20,706
JUST HAD ONE INCIDENT.

53
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,776
HAROLD FELL OFF THE CLIFF
WEARING MY BACKPACK.

54
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:27,180
I WAS AFRAID THERE WOULD BE
SOME SERIOUS INJURIES.

55
00:02:27,246 --> 00:02:29,081
WE WERE LAUGHING THAT HARD.

56
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:30,583
(Audience laughing)

57
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,585
YEAH.

58
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,587
(Laughing)

59
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,589
COME ON IN.

60
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,692
DID YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME,
THERE, YOUNG FELLA?

61
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,260
NO!

62
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,329
ONLY THE WORST TIME OF MY LIFE.

63
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:46,999
COME ON, HAROLD, DOESN'T GET
ANY BETTER THAN THIS.

64
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,535
THIS IS OUR ONE NIGHT
TO GO CRAZY.

65
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,504
CRAZY? IT WAS BORING!

66
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,039
BORING?

67
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:54,507
BORING, BORING, BORING!

68
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,042
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

69
00:02:56,108 --> 00:02:57,643
WE GOT 12 FEET UP THE HILL

70
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,513
AND EVERYBODY WAS TOO TIRED
TO GO ANY FURTHER.

71
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,616
BUSTER HADFIELD WENT HOME
AND GOT HIS MEDICATION.

72
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,551
NO ONE COULD GET THE FIRE LIT.

73
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,119
WELL, SPRING RUNOFF, HAROLD.

74
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,388
SPRING RUNOFF,
YEAH, SPRING RUNOFF!

75
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:11,357
EVERYTHING'S WET.

76
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:12,892
IT WAS SO BORING.

77
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,594
IT WAS INCREDIBLY TERRIBLE.

78
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,862
EVERYBODY'S COMPLAINING
ALL THE TIME.

79
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:20,066
"IT'S TOO DARK," "IT'S
TOO DAMP," "I GOT A SOAKER."

80
00:03:20,132 --> 00:03:21,534
COME ON!

81
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,836
MOOSE THOMPSON
WAS ASKING EVERYBODY

82
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,972
IF THEY BROUGHT
AN EXTRA SWEATER.

83
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:28,174
IT WAS BORING --
IT WAS INCREDIBLE.

84
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,176
NO DIRTY JOKES,
NO SCARY STORIES.

85
00:03:30,242 --> 00:03:33,446
JUST MIDDLE-AGED FAT GUYS
SITTING AROUND A DEAD FIRE

86
00:03:33,512 --> 00:03:34,947
ON HEMORRHOID CUSHIONS.

87
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:38,751
I'M SORRY, BUT YOU ALWAYS SAY,
"TELL ME WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND."

88
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,519
NO, "TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOUR MIND."

89
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:41,954
OH.

90
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:45,291
(Applause and cheering)

91
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,792
(Red): LOOK OUT BELOW!

92
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,260
AHHHH!

93
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:50,896
BILL'S PRACTISING
FOR A NEW EVENT

94
00:03:50,963 --> 00:03:54,700
FOR MEN'S NIGHT ON
THE MOUNTAIN -- CLIFF-DIVING.

95
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,502
HE'S JUST GETTING WARMED UP.

96
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,070
YOU OK, BILL?

97
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,705
OKEY-DOKEY,
THIS IS THE BIG ONE,

98
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:03,142
FOR A FREE WASH AND HOT WAX
AT LARRY'S BARBERSHOP.

99
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,244
UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS

100
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:07,813
TO GET MR. HUMPHREY
TO SAY THIS WORD.

101
00:04:13,018 --> 00:04:15,221
THIRTY SECONDS, AND GO.

102
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:17,556
ALL RIGHT, UH...

103
00:04:17,623 --> 00:04:19,625
AWARE.
SOBER?

104
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:22,228
TOUCHY.

105
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:23,762
FEELY.

106
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:25,231
TOUCHY-FEELY.

107
00:04:25,297 --> 00:04:26,932
RICHARD SIMMONS?

108
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:30,269
(Audience laughing)

109
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,805
COMPARED TO YOU,
YOUR WIFE IS MORE...

110
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,106
OVERWEIGHT.

111
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:37,009
EMOTIONALLY,

112
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:38,577
SHE'S MORE...

113
00:04:38,644 --> 00:04:39,912
WEEPY, WEEPY.

114
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,547
SHE'S WEEPY!

115
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,682
NO, NO, NO, NO, I'M SAYING

116
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:47,019
SHE NOTICES THINGS MORE
BECAUSE SHE'S...

117
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:48,520
PICKY.

118
00:04:48,587 --> 00:04:51,790
YOU'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME,
UNCLE RED.

119
00:04:51,857 --> 00:04:53,792
YOU WOULD NEVER TELL YOUR WIFE

120
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:57,196
THAT SHE'S PICKY, OVERWEIGHT,
OR WEEPY BECAUSE...

121
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,366
CASTRATION?

122
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:02,635
(Audience laughing)

123
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:05,004
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

124
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,605
DALTON.

125
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:08,407
THE VERTICAL HOLD

126
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,409
ON YOUR
TELEVISION SET...
SENSITIVE.

127
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,645
THAT'S IT!

128
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:12,711
(Strums guitar)

129
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:14,680
OH, DUFFY'S JOINTS
WERE LOOSE AND LOUD

130
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,515
YOU'D SWEAR
THEY ALL WERE BREAKIN'

131
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,817
HE'D TWIST HIS KNUCKLES
AND CRACK HIS KNEES

132
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:20,519
HE SOUNDED LIKE
A POPCORN MAKER

133
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,988
HE'D SNAP HIS BACK
AND RIPPLE HIS SPINE

134
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:25,024
DO IT ALL
WITH A BIG STUPID GRIN

135
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,726
THEN HE SLIPPED AND FELL
300 FEET ON A ROCK

136
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:30,429
AND THAT WAS THE LAST CRACK
WE HEARD FROM HIM

137
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,698
GARTH HARBLE HERE,
ANIMAL CONTROL,

138
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:36,402
WITH A TIP ON HOW TO DEAL
WITH A COMMON HOUSEHOLD PEST.

139
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:39,071
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
COME ON IN HERE, RED.

140
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:40,539
(Laughing)

141
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,541
VERY FUNNY, VERY FUNNY.

142
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:45,477
GARTH, YOU GOT
NO SERIOUS INJURY TODAY.

143
00:05:45,544 --> 00:05:47,012
SLOW WEEK, HUH?

144
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:50,015
WELL, YEAH, SEE, RED,
I'VE TAKEN SICK LEAVE.

145
00:05:50,082 --> 00:05:51,350
OH.

146
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,919
YEAH, YEAH,
AFTER THAT SPIDER BITE,

147
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,989
I STARTED FALLING DOWN
ALL OVER THE PLACE

148
00:05:57,055 --> 00:06:00,225
AND I MANAGED TO FLATTEN
A LITTLE PARAKEET.

149
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:04,329
WHEN THE BOSS FOUND OUT,
HE SENT ME HOME FOR THE WEEK.

150
00:06:04,396 --> 00:06:05,964
POOR LITTLE PARAKEET.

151
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:08,167
YOU HAVE A TIP FOR US AT ALL?

152
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:09,501
HUH?

153
00:06:09,568 --> 00:06:11,537
YOU HAVE A TIP FOR US TODAY?

154
00:06:11,603 --> 00:06:13,172
OH, YES, YES.

155
00:06:13,238 --> 00:06:15,007
DO YOU KNOW WHAT A VOLE IS?

156
00:06:15,073 --> 00:06:17,543
YES, IT'S LIKE A LITTLE MOUSE,
I BELIEVE.

157
00:06:17,609 --> 00:06:20,646
EXCEPT THAT THE VOLE HIDES
UNDER YOUR LAWN

158
00:06:20,712 --> 00:06:24,550
AND HE EATS THE ROOTS
OF YOUR GRASS AND YOUR PLANTS.

159
00:06:24,616 --> 00:06:26,018
OH, YEAH?

160
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:29,221
I'VE LOCATED THE TWO ENTRANCES
INTO THE VOLE'S TUNNEL.

161
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:31,723
I SHOVE A PAPER BAG
INTO THE FIRST HOLE.

162
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,058
I SEE THAT NOW.

163
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:36,228
INTO THE SECOND HOLE,
I'VE GOT PLASTIC TUBING.

164
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:37,629
WHAT DO I DO NEXT?

165
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:40,566
I WOULD THINK YOU'D PUMP IN
THE METHANE AT THIS POINT.

166
00:06:40,632 --> 00:06:42,768
I'LL PRETEND
I DIDN'T HEAR THAT, RED.

167
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:44,269
NO, I DON'T DO THAT.

168
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:47,372
NO, I'M GONNA BLOW VERY HARD
INTO THIS TUBING,

169
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,143
SO THAT THE VOLE WILL POP OUT
THE OTHER SIDE INTO THAT BAG.

170
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:52,511
ISN'T THAT GREAT?

171
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,513
WELL, NOW, THAT IS GREAT.

172
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,016
RUN OVER THERE, AND WHEN THE
VOLE COMES OUT, YOU SNATCH IT.

173
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,518
HEY, THIS IS FUN.

174
00:06:59,584 --> 00:07:01,987
VOLE SNATCHING COULD CATCH ON
AT THE LODGE.

175
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:03,522
REALLY?

176
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:05,023
ALL RIGHT, BLOW AWAY.

177
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,992
WE'LL GIVE 'ER A BLAST!

178
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,527
ALL RIGHT.

179
00:07:08,593 --> 00:07:10,495
(Vole
squeaking)

180
00:07:10,562 --> 00:07:12,564
AHHH!

181
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:24,009
WELL, YOU MUST HAVE IT, GARTH.

182
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,510
WHAT?

183
00:07:25,577 --> 00:07:27,079
OH!

184
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:31,783
THIS IS FUN.

185
00:07:33,618 --> 00:07:35,554
OH, BOY.

186
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,522
ANOTHER SUPER DAY.

187
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:39,091
(Burping)

188
00:07:39,157 --> 00:07:40,792
HAROLD DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND

189
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:42,794
THAT YOU GET
TO A CERTAIN AGE

190
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:44,496
WHERE YOU'RE
NOT PREPARED

191
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:46,865
TO GIVE UP THE
CREATURE COMFORTS.

192
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:49,734
I THOUGHT I'D TAKE
THIS WEEK'S "HANDYMAN CORNER"

193
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:51,703
AND SHOW YOU
HOW YOU CAN SATISFY

194
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,805
MAN'S TWO BASIC
FUNDAMENTAL NEEDS.

195
00:07:53,872 --> 00:07:55,941
NUMBER ONE, A COMFY CHAIR
TO SIT ON,

196
00:07:56,007 --> 00:07:57,609
AND NUMBER TWO, JUNK FOOD.

197
00:07:57,676 --> 00:07:59,077
GO TO YOUR GROCERY STORE

198
00:07:59,144 --> 00:08:01,346
AND PICK UP
YOUR FAVOURITE SNACKS...

199
00:08:02,814 --> 00:08:04,182
... JUST LIKE THIS.

200
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:07,152
MAKE SURE YOU BRING
THE CART WITH YOU, TOO.

201
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:08,854
DON'T WORRY ABOUT TAKING IT.

202
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,222
THE STORE DOESN'T MIND.

203
00:08:10,288 --> 00:08:13,058
THEY FACTOR THE COST --
WHOA, COME BACK HERE --

204
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:14,493
INTO THE PRICE
OF THEIR GROCERIES.

205
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:16,027
BESIDES, IF THEY--

206
00:08:16,094 --> 00:08:18,797
MY GOSH, FLOORS ARE UNEVEN
AT THE LODGE.

207
00:08:18,864 --> 00:08:21,366
IF THEY FILL THE CART
WITH GROCERIES,

208
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:25,003
THEY DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO CARRY THE WHOLE THING HOME.

209
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,504
ALL RIGHT.

210
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:30,308
ALL RIGHT, NOW, STEP TWO,
WE WANT TO CUT DOWN THE SIDES

211
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,510
SO WE CAN FOLD THAT THING DOWN.

212
00:08:32,577 --> 00:08:34,846
JUST GRAB A SAW, HERE,
AND GET AT THAT.

213
00:08:34,913 --> 00:08:36,414
(Blade breaking)

214
00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:43,455
(Grunting)

215
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:44,990
THERE WE GO.

216
00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:47,559
THAT'S THE COMFORT ASPECT
TAKEN CARE OF.

217
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:49,628
NOW WE CAN TAKE A LOOK
AT SAFETY.

218
00:08:49,694 --> 00:08:51,296
WE GOT THIS-- WHOA, WHOA!

219
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:53,932
GOT THIS OZONE HOLE
FROM PEOPLE WHO THINK

220
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:56,468
EVERYTHING GOOD
IS SPRAYED OUT OF A CAN.

221
00:08:56,534 --> 00:08:58,470
WE GOTTA WORRY ABOUT--
WHOA! -- ABOUT THAT.

222
00:08:58,536 --> 00:09:00,005
I GOT THIS-- MAN!

223
00:09:00,071 --> 00:09:01,640
I GOT THIS WINDOW HERE,

224
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:04,542
WHICH I'M GONNA MOUNT
ON TOP OF THE UNIT.

225
00:09:04,609 --> 00:09:07,245
GOT A BLIND ON THERE
SO IT NOW BECOMES

226
00:09:07,312 --> 00:09:09,514
A VARIABLE-ANGLE
U.V. DEFLECTOR.

227
00:09:09,581 --> 00:09:13,018
GOT A SCREEN ON HERE
TO KEEP THE BUGS OUT.

228
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:14,519
SO I'LL JUST MOUNT--

229
00:09:14,586 --> 00:09:18,656
I'LL JUST MOUNT THIS RIG
ON HERE WITH THESE 2 x 2's.

230
00:09:18,723 --> 00:09:20,358
OH!

231
00:09:39,444 --> 00:09:41,579
JUST GET YOUR SNACKS
HUNG ON THERE.

232
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:43,882
YOU FOLD THESE THINGS
FOR TRAVELLING,

233
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:46,451
BUT WHEN YOU ARRIVE
WHERE YOU WANT TO BE,

234
00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:48,720
SWING 'EM OPEN
AND GET COMFORTABLE.

235
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:50,522
OHH...

236
00:09:50,588 --> 00:09:52,524
NOT THAT EASY TO DO.

237
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,058
THERE YOU ARE, HUH?

238
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,395
SITTING PRETTY WITH LIFE'S
TREASURES AT YOUR FINGERTIPS.

239
00:09:57,462 --> 00:09:58,930
YOU GET THIRSTY, YOU SAY?

240
00:09:58,997 --> 00:10:00,965
HOOK UP ONE
OF THESE PLASTIC HOSES

241
00:10:01,032 --> 00:10:02,967
TO A BOTTLE
THAT'S ABOVE YOUR HEAD

242
00:10:03,034 --> 00:10:04,702
AND IT'S EVEN A GRAVITY FEED.

243
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:07,906
WHEN PEOPLE SAY, "YOU SUCK,"
YOU CAN PROVE OTHERWISE.

244
00:10:07,972 --> 00:10:10,909
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

245
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:13,077
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

246
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:14,779
I'LL HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT

247
00:10:14,846 --> 00:10:17,081
WHILE I'M WAITING
FOR THE AMBULANCE.

248
00:10:17,148 --> 00:10:18,883
(Crash)

249
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,553
IF YOU WANT REASONS
NOT TO GO BUNGEE-JUMPING,

250
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:23,454
STAY TUNED FOR BUZZ SHERWOOD.

251
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:30,295
OUR NIGHT ON THE MOUNTAIN
GOT US THINKING.

252
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:32,263
I HATE TO ADMIT HAROLD'S RIGHT,

253
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,099
BUT IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT WE'VE LOST OUR MANHOOD,

254
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:38,569
THROUGH MARRIAGE OR SOME OTHER
ACCIDENT IN THE WORKPLACE.

255
00:10:38,636 --> 00:10:40,872
WELL, YOU DON'T NEED
FOOLISH STUNTS

256
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:42,340
TO PROVE YOU'RE A MAN.

257
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:45,510
JUST ACT RESPONSIBLY
TOWARDS FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS.

258
00:10:45,576 --> 00:10:47,245
GET SERIOUS, HAROLD.

259
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:48,813
SO NOW
WE'RE GOING

260
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,782
TO DO SOMETHING REALLY MANLY.

261
00:10:50,848 --> 00:10:53,284
YOU MEAN BEING GOOD FATHERS,
GOOD HUSBANDS,

262
00:10:53,351 --> 00:10:54,819
BEING GOOD PROVIDERS?

263
00:10:54,886 --> 00:10:56,487
WHERE DO YOU GET THIS STUFF?

264
00:10:56,554 --> 00:10:58,323
NO, WE
WERE THINKING

265
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:03,161
OF MAYBE GOING WHITE-WATER
RAFTING ON MERCURY CREEK.

266
00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:06,597
THE PROBLEM IS, THE
WHITE-WATER'S CHEMICAL FOAM.

267
00:11:06,664 --> 00:11:09,701
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
IN DEAD MAN'S WHIRLPOOL

268
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:11,803
AND HAVE THE RIVER EAT
THE RUBBER OFF YOUR PONTOONS.

269
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:14,572
GANDHI WAS A GREAT MAN
AND SO WAS ALBERT SCHWEITZER.

270
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,941
THEY DIDN'T NEED STUNTS
TO PROVE THEY WERE MEN.

271
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:19,043
THEY WEREN'T LODGE MEMBERS,
ALL RIGHT?

272
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:22,080
WE DECIDED TO GO CLIFF-DIVING
OFF ROCK REEF POINT.

273
00:11:22,146 --> 00:11:24,248
I GOT THE APPLICATION FORM
RIGHT HERE.

274
00:11:24,315 --> 00:11:25,750
REALLY ONLY TWO RULES.

275
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:28,352
YOU GOTTA PROMISE
TO GO RIGHT OFF THE TOP.

276
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:30,822
YOU GOTTA DO YOUR BEST
TO HIT THE WATER.

277
00:11:30,888 --> 00:11:32,290
WANT ME TO SIGN YOU UP?

278
00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:33,758
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

279
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:35,293
NO, NEVER, NEVER, NO, NO.

280
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:38,296
GOOD, GOOD, THAT PROVES
IT'S FOR MEN ONLY.

281
00:11:38,362 --> 00:11:40,798
PROVES IT'S FOR MEN
LIKE
 YOU
 ONLY.

282
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:42,300
WE'RE A DYING BREED, HAROLD.

283
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:43,768
COINCIDENCE?

284
00:11:43,835 --> 00:11:45,903
I DON'T THINK SO.

285
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,739
GARTH HARBLE HERE,
ANIMAL CONTROL,

286
00:11:48,806 --> 00:11:52,810
REMINDING YOU THAT
WILD ANIMALS CAN SMELL FEAR.

287
00:11:52,877 --> 00:11:55,146
OF COURSE,
IF IT SMELLS BAD ENOUGH,

288
00:11:55,213 --> 00:11:56,881
WHY, THEY WON'T EAT YOU.

289
00:11:58,716 --> 00:12:00,384
HEY, I'M ALIVE.

290
00:12:03,888 --> 00:12:07,391
YOU'RE GONNA PAY FOR THIS
UNTIL THE MOON PASSES CHINA.

291
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,261
SHE COMES HOME FROM WORK,
STRESSED TO TEARS,

292
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:13,998
AND BLUBBERS OUT THE FIVE WORDS
THAT NO MAN UNDERSTANDS:

293
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:16,367
"I JUST WANT TO BE HELD."

294
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:21,772
JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE COMING
TO THE END OF THE BREAK

295
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,475
BETWEEN "WHEEL OF FORTUNE"
AND "JEOPARDY",

296
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:27,278
YOU TRIED TO SUBSTITUTE A HUG
FOR A "HELD".

297
00:12:27,345 --> 00:12:28,779
A FIVE-SECOND HUG?

298
00:12:28,846 --> 00:12:31,849
DON'T YOU KNOW 15 SECONDS
IS THE ABSOLUTE MINIMUM

299
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,751
FOR "I JUST WANT TO BE HELD"?

300
00:12:33,818 --> 00:12:36,354
THAT EXTRA 10 SECONDS
WILL BE THE DIFFERENCE

301
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,289
BETWEEN THE COUCH
AND THE GARAGE.

302
00:12:38,356 --> 00:12:39,991
FORGET ALL ABOUT THE BED.

303
00:12:40,057 --> 00:12:42,526
YOU COULD HAVE HELD HER
FOR 15 SECONDS

304
00:12:42,593 --> 00:12:44,495
IF YOU'D JUST USED YOUR HEAD.

305
00:12:44,562 --> 00:12:47,331
ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS
TILT HER TO THE SIDE

306
00:12:47,398 --> 00:12:51,302
AND THEN YOU COULD HAVE SEEN
"JEOPARDY" OVER HER SHOULDER.

307
00:12:51,369 --> 00:12:53,738
YOU COULD HAVE WATCHED
THE WHOLE HALF HOUR

308
00:12:53,804 --> 00:12:55,306
BUT YOU WEREN'T THINKING.

309
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:57,274
IT'S TIME FOR A QUICK FIX.

310
00:12:57,341 --> 00:13:00,878
CLAIM THAT YOU FEEL
A LITTLE SOMETHING COMING ON

311
00:13:00,945 --> 00:13:04,315
AND YOU DIDN'T WANT TO PASS
THE BUG ON TO HER.

312
00:13:04,382 --> 00:13:07,585
IF YOU THINK YOU'RE UP
TO THE ACTING CHALLENGE,

313
00:13:07,651 --> 00:13:09,820
JUMP BACK WITH A STARTLED LOOK

314
00:13:09,887 --> 00:13:12,390
AND SAY,
"HAVE YOU LOST WEIGHT?"

315
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,827
WHATEVER YOU DO
IN THE GREAT OUTDOORS,

316
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:18,329
ALWAYS REMEMBER, SAFETY FIRST.

317
00:13:18,396 --> 00:13:19,830
RIGHT, BUZZ?

318
00:13:19,897 --> 00:13:21,332
YOU GOT
THAT RIGHT.

319
00:13:21,398 --> 00:13:24,135
JUST BECAUSE YOU
SAW SOMEBODY ON T.V.

320
00:13:24,201 --> 00:13:26,937
DOING SOMETHING
LIKE BUNGEE-JUMPING,

321
00:13:27,004 --> 00:13:29,774
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU CAN DO IT YOURSELF.

322
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,575
TELL THE VIEWERS
WHAT YOU THINK

323
00:13:31,642 --> 00:13:34,278
THE PROFESSIONAL
BUNGEE-JUMPER WOULD DO FIRST.

324
00:13:34,345 --> 00:13:35,846
THEY'D GO OUT
AND FIND

325
00:13:35,913 --> 00:13:38,782
SOMETHING REALLY
STABLE FOR JUMPING OFF.

326
00:13:38,849 --> 00:13:41,752
LIKE MAYBE
THAT GIANT PINE TREE THERE?

327
00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:43,921
IN HINDSIGHT,
YOU'D THINK THAT,

328
00:13:43,988 --> 00:13:46,157
BUT I FOUND OUT
THAT GIANT PINES

329
00:13:46,223 --> 00:13:48,792
AREN'T THAT GREAT
FOR BUNGEE-JUMPING.

330
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:50,261
WHAT ABOUT POWER LINES?

331
00:13:50,327 --> 00:13:52,796
YOU MAKE SURE
THERE'S NONE OF THEM AROUND.

332
00:13:52,863 --> 00:13:54,298
OH, FOR SURE.

333
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:56,166
I THOUGHT
I COULD CLEAR THOSE

334
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:58,802
BUT ME AND GRAVITY
NEVER DID GET ALONG.

335
00:13:58,869 --> 00:14:00,604
DON'T MAKE
YOUR BUNGEE CORD

336
00:14:00,671 --> 00:14:02,606
OUT OF STUFF
AROUND THE HOUSE.

337
00:14:02,673 --> 00:14:04,542
DON'T GO USING
OLD SUSPENDERS

338
00:14:04,608 --> 00:14:07,111
OR SPANDEX BIKE
PANTS OR ELASTICS OR...

339
00:14:07,177 --> 00:14:08,812
WHAT ELSE
DID I USE, RED?

340
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,316
WELL, I SEE PANTYHOSE,
POLO PYJAMAS, AND JOCK STRAPS.

341
00:14:12,383 --> 00:14:14,318
DON'T USE
ANY OF THOSE.

342
00:14:14,385 --> 00:14:16,320
IF YOU WANT TO GO
BUNGEE-JUMPING,

343
00:14:16,387 --> 00:14:18,822
GO WHERE T@Y HAVE
BUNGEE-JUMPING, RIGHT?

344
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:20,991
WHERE THEY HAVE
THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT

345
00:14:21,058 --> 00:14:22,793
AND PROFESSIONAL SUPERVISION.

346
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,762
YEAH, WELL,
WE'LL SAY THAT NOW.

347
00:14:24,828 --> 00:14:27,264
ALWAYS REMEMBER, SAFETY FIRST.

348
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:29,433
SAFETY FIRST,
SAFETY FIRST.

349
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,769
CAN YOU CUT ME
DOWN NOW, RED?

350
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:34,271
HAVE THEY TURNED
THE POWER OFF YET?

351
00:14:34,338 --> 00:14:36,774
(Electricity zapping)

352
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,275
NOPE.

353
00:14:38,342 --> 00:14:40,711
I THOUGHT THEY WERE
TELEPHONE WIRES.

354
00:14:40,778 --> 00:14:43,213
I'M THINKING,
"HOW MUCH ELECTRICITY'S

355
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,815
"IN A TELEPHONE
WIRE?"

356
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:48,452
(Laughing)

357
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:51,422
SO, UNCLE RED, HOW MANY PEOPLE
HAVE SIGNED UP

358
00:14:51,488 --> 00:14:53,390
FOR THE CLIFF-DIVING CONTEST?

359
00:14:53,457 --> 00:14:56,560
NONE OF THE MEN
WERE MOTIVATED TO SIGN UP

360
00:14:56,627 --> 00:14:58,796
UNTIL I ADDED
A SPECTATOR GALLERY

361
00:14:58,862 --> 00:15:01,832
AND GAVE FREE TICKETS
TO THE WIVES AND GIRLFRIENDS

362
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:04,735
AND THE CONTESTANTS
FOR THE "MISS TEEN" PAGEANT.

363
00:15:04,802 --> 00:15:06,103
WHAT?

364
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,672
A-A-ALL
T-T-THE B-B-BABES--

365
00:15:08,739 --> 00:15:12,342
ALL THE "MISS TEEN" PAGEANT
PEOPLE-- GIRLS WILL BE THERE?

366
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:14,711
YEAH, EXCEPT FOR
MISS CONGENIALITY.

367
00:15:14,778 --> 00:15:17,581
SHE WAS A LITTLE TOO BUBBLY
FOR OUR CROWD.

368
00:15:17,648 --> 00:15:21,151
YOU KNOW, KNOWING THAT
THE WOMEN WERE GONNA BE THERE

369
00:15:21,218 --> 00:15:25,155
REALLY GOT THE MEN INTERESTED
IN SHOWING OFF THEIR MANHOOD.

370
00:15:25,222 --> 00:15:29,293
ANYBODY WHO IS NOT CLIFF-DIVING
IS PROBABLY NOT A REAL MAN.

371
00:15:30,828 --> 00:15:32,262
HEY, HANDYMEN!

372
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:35,465
I KNOW A LOT OF TOOLS
COME WITH A BUTTON ON THE SIDE

373
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:37,534
TO LOCK 'EM
IN THE "ON" POSITION,

374
00:15:37,601 --> 00:15:39,837
BUT I WOULDN'T ADVISE IT!

375
00:15:41,805 --> 00:15:44,741
WELL, AS I TRIED TO WARN YOU
EARLIER IN THE SHOW,

376
00:15:44,808 --> 00:15:46,844
THIS WEEK'S
"ADVENTURES WITH BILL",

377
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,979
BILL'S GONNA TRY
AND WORK HIS WAY--

378
00:15:49,046 --> 00:15:50,948
YEAH, NICE DIVE, BILL.

379
00:15:51,014 --> 00:15:54,218
BILL'S WORKING HIS WAY UP
TO THE CLIFF-DIVING CONTEST.

380
00:15:54,284 --> 00:15:56,587
HE THOUGHT HE'D TRY DIVING
OFF THE DOCK.

381
00:15:56,653 --> 00:15:58,989
MUST HAVE HIT SOMETHING
THAT HE'D EATEN.

382
00:15:59,056 --> 00:16:01,692
HE THOUGHT HE'D GET UP
ON THE CHAIR AND DIVE.

383
00:16:01,758 --> 00:16:03,227
THAT'S A FAMILY HEIRLOOM

384
00:16:03,293 --> 00:16:06,463
THAT'S BEEN IN MY FAMILY
SINCE THE TRAILER BURNED DOWN.

385
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,765
I WONDER WHY HE NEEDED ME
TO HOLD THE--

386
00:16:08,832 --> 00:16:10,300
OH!

387
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:12,302
WELL, THANK YOU, BILL.

388
00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:13,637
BILL? BILL?

389
00:16:13,704 --> 00:16:14,938
OH, BOY.

390
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:16,373
GOING WELL, AS USUAL.

391
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,808
I GOT THE CHAIR FIXED.

392
00:16:17,874 --> 00:16:19,509
THAT WAS A WASTE OF TIME.

393
00:16:19,576 --> 00:16:21,478
SO NOW WHAT BILL'S GONNA DO...

394
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:23,680
NEXT STEP UP, PHASE THREE,
I GUESS,

395
00:16:23,747 --> 00:16:25,182
IS TO GO OFF THE LADDER.

396
00:16:25,248 --> 00:16:26,750
TO ME, I'M NOTICING

397
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:29,686
HE'S GOT THAT LADDER CLOSE
TO THE EDGE, AND WE TRY TO BE

398
00:16:29,753 --> 00:16:31,822
A BIT SAFETY-CONSCIOUS,
AS YOU KNOW,

399
00:16:31,888 --> 00:16:34,324
OR AT LEAST CONSCIOUS,
HERE AT THE LODGE.

400
00:16:34,391 --> 00:16:36,493
I'M SAYING,
"GET IT RIGHT BACK,"

401
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,597
BUT THE THING WITH SAFETY IS
YOU CAN BE ACTUALLY TOO SAFE.

402
00:16:40,664 --> 00:16:42,032
OHHH!

403
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:45,235
I'M THINKING WE MAY HAVE
PULLED 'ER BACK TOO FAR.

404
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:46,770
OH, YEAH.

405
00:16:46,837 --> 00:16:49,206
BUT ANYWAY,
FOR WHATEVER REASON --

406
00:16:49,272 --> 00:16:51,641
MAYBE 'CAUSE HE BANGED
HIS HEAD --

407
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,845
HE'S DECIDED HE'S READY
TO ATTACK THE CLIFF,

408
00:16:54,911 --> 00:16:57,848
SO HE'S GONNA NEED THE ROPE
AND HE WANTS ME...

409
00:16:57,914 --> 00:16:59,449
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

410
00:16:59,516 --> 00:17:03,386
I WANT TO SEE HOW IT TURNS OUT,
AND I HOPE YOU DO, TOO.

411
00:17:03,453 --> 00:17:06,890
ROCK REEF POINT IS
A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF GEOGRAPHY.

412
00:17:06,957 --> 00:17:09,159
IT'S GOT THE INSIDE
OF THE REEF.

413
00:17:09,226 --> 00:17:10,694
I WAS A LITTLE TIRED.

414
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:14,264
THERE'S THE ROCK AND THE REEF
AND THERE'S A POINT.

415
00:17:14,331 --> 00:17:15,899
YOU DON'T SEE THE POINT

416
00:17:15,966 --> 00:17:18,869
UNLESS YOU GET A CLOSE-UP
OF BILL'S HEAD.

417
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:20,604
THE IDEA IS, THROW THIS--

418
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,072
THE LOOP WAS TOO SMALL.

419
00:17:22,139 --> 00:17:25,308
WE'RE TRYING TO USE THE ROPE
TO PULL OURSELVES UP,

420
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,110
BUT EVERY ROPE HAS TWO ENDS.

421
00:17:27,177 --> 00:17:29,312
ON THE OTHER END
IS A BIGGER LOOP.

422
00:17:29,379 --> 00:17:32,616
THIS IS GONNA WORK,
AND BILL'S GOOD WITH THE ROPE.

423
00:17:32,682 --> 00:17:34,918
THERE WE GO -- LOOK AT THAT.

424
00:17:34,985 --> 00:17:37,120
SO HE'S ALL SET AND UP WE GO

425
00:17:37,187 --> 00:17:40,590
AND I'M STARTING TO SEE
WHY MOUNTAIN CLIMBING

426
00:17:40,657 --> 00:17:42,058
IS SO DANGEROUS.

427
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,593
WE GET UP THERE.

428
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,195
THAT WAS A HECK OF A CLIMB.

429
00:17:45,262 --> 00:17:47,731
I THOUGHT I SHOULD PULL
THAT ROPE UP

430
00:17:47,797 --> 00:17:49,833
AND GET THAT OUT OF HIS WAY.

431
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,135
WHAT I'D FORGOTTEN WAS,
YOU SEE,

432
00:17:52,202 --> 00:17:53,870
THAT THE ROPE STILL HAD

433
00:17:53,937 --> 00:17:56,273
THAT SMALL LOOP ON THE END.

434
00:17:56,339 --> 00:17:57,741
OH! OH!

435
00:17:57,807 --> 00:18:01,478
BILL HAS KIND OF AN UNORTHODOX
APPROACH TO HIS DIVES.

436
00:18:01,544 --> 00:18:03,880
NOW HE'S READY,
AND UNFORTUNATELY,

437
00:18:03,947 --> 00:18:05,348
HIS FOOT WENT INTO

438
00:18:05,415 --> 00:18:06,850
THAT SMALL LOOP AND NOW

439
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,685
THE ROPE IS NOT AS LONG

440
00:18:08,752 --> 00:18:10,320
AS HIS DIVE!

441
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:19,562
ON THIS WEEK'S EXPERT PORTION
OF THE SHOW, WE HAVE EXPERTS.

442
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:22,832
MY UNCLE RED AND HIS
GOOD FRIEND, EDGAR MONTROSE.

443
00:18:22,899 --> 00:18:28,004
(Applause and cheering)

444
00:18:28,071 --> 00:18:29,639
FIRST LETTER GOES AS FOLLOWS:

445
00:18:29,706 --> 00:18:32,709
"DEAR EXPERTS, I TOOK
MY CHILDREN TO A MOVIE RECENTLY

446
00:18:32,776 --> 00:18:35,712
"AND I WAS DISGUSTED
BY THE LANGUAGE AND THE NUDITY,

447
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:37,981
"AND THAT WAS JUST
IN THE CAR BESIDE US."

448
00:18:38,048 --> 00:18:40,183
(Audience laughing)

449
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,818
"THE MOVIE WAS

450
00:18:41,885 --> 00:18:44,220
"FAR TOO VIOLENT FOR CHILDREN
OR SENIORS

451
00:18:44,287 --> 00:18:46,156
"OR ANYONE
WHO HADN'T SPENT TIME

452
00:18:46,222 --> 00:18:48,024
"IN EITHER PRISON OR THE NAVY.

453
00:18:48,091 --> 00:18:50,894
"HOW CAN WE GET HOLLYWOOD
TO CLEAN UP ITS ACT?

454
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,495
"SIGNED, OFFENDED."

455
00:18:52,562 --> 00:18:54,297
I AGREE WITH THIS VIEWER.

456
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:58,468
MY WIFE, BERNICE, DRAGGED ME
OUT TO SEE THAT "MARY POPPINS".

457
00:18:58,535 --> 00:19:00,303
MAN, TALK ABOUT OFFENSIVE!

458
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,739
I THOUGHT
I WAS GONNA GET DIABETES!

459
00:19:02,806 --> 00:19:04,140
THEY STARTED SINGING

460
00:19:04,207 --> 00:19:07,343
THAT "SUPERCALI-NARCOLEPTIC-
EXTRA-HALITOSIS",

461
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,913
I JUST ABOUT LOST
MY LICORICE "NIBS".

462
00:19:09,979 --> 00:19:12,615
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S WRONG
WITH MOVIES.

463
00:19:12,682 --> 00:19:15,652
THEY GIVE THE KIDS
A FALSE SENSE OF REALITY.

464
00:19:15,718 --> 00:19:17,353
LIKE
THAT MOVIE

465
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,089
"SPEED", WHEN THE BUS BLEW UP.

466
00:19:20,156 --> 00:19:22,892
YOU NEVER GET THAT MUCH FLAME.

467
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:24,494
(Laughing)

468
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:26,996
THEY SHOWED IT
AS A BIG FIREBALL

469
00:19:27,063 --> 00:19:30,967
BUT A REAL BUS EXPLOSION
IS ALL SMOKE AND MIRRORS.

470
00:19:31,034 --> 00:19:34,504
I KNOW -- I WAS THE MECHANIC
AT A BUS COMPANY

471
00:19:34,571 --> 00:19:36,172
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

472
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:37,707
I CAUTION
OUR VIEWER,

473
00:19:37,774 --> 00:19:39,776
THERE HAVE BEEN
SOME GREAT MOVIES

474
00:19:39,842 --> 00:19:42,345
THAT ARE BOTH EDUCATIONAL
AND UPLIFTING.

475
00:19:42,412 --> 00:19:45,882
YEAH, LIKE "THE BRIDGE
OVER THE RIVER KWAI".

476
00:19:45,949 --> 00:19:47,650
DID YOU SEE THAT BABY GO UP
AT THE END?

477
00:19:47,717 --> 00:19:49,419
AND THE TRAIN

478
00:19:49,485 --> 00:19:51,921
WENT CRASHING INTO THE RIVER?

479
00:19:51,988 --> 00:19:54,557
WON AN OSCAR FOR BEST PICTURE.

480
00:19:54,624 --> 00:19:56,960
BUT THAT ONE NOW...

481
00:19:57,026 --> 00:19:59,295
UH, "BRIDGES
OF MADISON COUNTY".

482
00:19:59,362 --> 00:20:02,532
I WAITED FOR ONE OF THOSE
BRIDGES TO GO UP, BUT NOTHING.

483
00:20:02,598 --> 00:20:03,967
(Audience laughing)

484
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:06,235
I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE
DISAPPOINTED.

485
00:20:06,302 --> 00:20:09,539
EVERYBODY IN THE THEATRE
WAS CRYING BY THE END.

486
00:20:09,605 --> 00:20:10,974
(Laughing)

487
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,810
MOVIES TODAY
JUST DON'T DELIVER.

488
00:20:13,876 --> 00:20:16,746
THERE HAVE BEEN
SOME GREAT FILMS MADE,

489
00:20:16,813 --> 00:20:18,281
LIKE "FOREST GUMP",

490
00:20:18,348 --> 00:20:19,916
"THE PIANO",
"DANCES WITH WOLVES".

491
00:20:19,982 --> 00:20:21,918
I SAW THAT ONE.

492
00:20:21,984 --> 00:20:28,424
(Laughing and applause)

493
00:20:28,491 --> 00:20:30,893
NOW, THE NATIVE GUY WAS OK...

494
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,428
(Laughing)

495
00:20:32,495 --> 00:20:36,032
SHOULD HAVE GOT THE OSCAR.

496
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:38,601
BUT THE REST OF IT WAS A YAWN.

497
00:20:38,668 --> 00:20:41,170
NOW, WHAT THEY NEEDED THERE IS

498
00:20:41,237 --> 00:20:45,441
ONE OF THOSE BUFFALO
TO GET BACKED UP WITH METHANE.

499
00:20:45,508 --> 00:20:47,410
(Laughing)

500
00:20:47,477 --> 00:20:50,847
HE'LL CATCH HIS HOOF
ON A PIECE OF FLINT

501
00:20:50,913 --> 00:20:53,950
AND GO OFF LIKE
A BIG FURRY GRENADE.

502
00:20:54,016 --> 00:20:56,919
KABOOM!

503
00:20:56,986 --> 00:20:59,455
TALK ABOUT YOUR BURGERS TO GO.

504
00:20:59,522 --> 00:21:01,324
(Laughing)

505
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,959
HAROLD, COME HERE.

506
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:05,361
GIVE ME THAT MANUAL.

507
00:21:05,428 --> 00:21:07,363
GIVE ME THAT MANUAL.

508
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,898
LOOK AT THAT.

509
00:21:08,965 --> 00:21:13,903
"ALL-TERRAIN VEHICLES:
SAND, GRAVEL, LAKES."

510
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,905
WHAT?

511
00:21:15,972 --> 00:21:17,440
"FROZEN LAKES."

512
00:21:18,941 --> 00:21:21,410
AH, FROZEN.

513
00:21:21,477 --> 00:21:24,280
I MIGHT HAVE JUMPED THE GUN
A BIT ON THAT.

514
00:21:24,347 --> 00:21:28,184
WHAT TIME DO WE HAVE TO GET IT
BACK TO THE RENTAL PLACE?

515
00:21:28,251 --> 00:21:30,453
A LITTLE ADVICE FOR ANY OF YOU

516
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:34,690
PLANNING SOME KIND OF EVENT
FOR YOUR NEXT FAMILY REUNION.

517
00:21:34,757 --> 00:21:37,426
DON'T MAKE IT
A CLIFF-DIVING CONTEST.

518
00:21:37,493 --> 00:21:41,397
(Audience laughing)

519
00:21:41,464 --> 00:21:42,932
THESE ARE REAL MEN.

520
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:45,134
WANT TO KNOW WHAT REAL MEN DO?

521
00:21:45,201 --> 00:21:49,572
THEY CLIMB ROCK REEF POINT
IN A SELECTION OF BATHING SUITS

522
00:21:49,639 --> 00:21:52,642
YOU DO NOT WANT TO SEE
ON A FULL STOMACH,

523
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,344
AND EVERY ONE OF THEM
CHICKENED OUT.

524
00:21:55,411 --> 00:21:59,148
A BUNCH OF THE WOMEN CLIMBED UP
AND STARTED DIVING OFF

525
00:21:59,215 --> 00:22:00,650
TO SHOW UP
THE MEN.

526
00:22:00,716 --> 00:22:02,218
I KNEW WE WERE IN TROUBLE

527
00:22:02,284 --> 00:22:05,755
WHEN MOOSE THOMPSON'S MOTHER
DID A BELLY-FLOP FROM THE TOP.

528
00:22:05,821 --> 00:22:08,824
IT BROUGHT THE HOUSE DOWN,
AND PART OF THE LODGE.

529
00:22:08,891 --> 00:22:12,228
BOY, DID SHE HIT
THE WATER!

530
00:22:12,294 --> 00:22:15,865
PORT ASBESTOS HASN'T HAD
THAT MUCH RAIN IN 12 YEARS.

531
00:22:15,931 --> 00:22:19,402
IT PROVES THERE'S NO REAL MEN
LEFT IN THESE PARTS.

532
00:22:19,468 --> 00:22:23,372
THERE ARE, BUT LOTS OF THEM
ARE WOMEN, UNFORTUNATELY.

533
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:24,874
(Possum squeal)

534
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,409
MEETING TIME, UNCLE RED.

535
00:22:26,475 --> 00:22:27,943
YOU GO GET DRIED OFF.

536
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,311
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

537
00:22:29,378 --> 00:22:31,814
I'M COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

538
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:33,716
MAYBE YOU CAN MAKE
THE NEIGHBOURS

539
00:22:33,783 --> 00:22:35,184
COME OVER ANOTHER NIGHT.

540
00:22:35,251 --> 00:22:37,686
MAYBE I'M NOT A REAL MAN
BUT I'M REAL TIRED

541
00:22:37,753 --> 00:22:40,456
AND NOT REAL INTERESTED
IN BEING REAL SOCIABLE.

542
00:22:40,523 --> 00:22:42,825
THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

543
00:22:42,892 --> 00:22:46,629
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND HAROLD
AND THE WHOLE GANG UP HERE,

544
00:22:46,695 --> 00:22:48,397
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

545
00:22:48,464 --> 00:22:51,667
(Applause)

546
00:22:51,734 --> 00:22:57,406
(Possum squeal)

547
00:22:57,473 --> 00:22:58,908
(Harold): OK, ALL RISE.

548
00:22:58,974 --> 00:23:00,509
ALL RISE.

549
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:08,384
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

550
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,853
(Red): SIT DOWN.
