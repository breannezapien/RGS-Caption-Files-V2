COMES TO OUR PANTS.

ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

115

YOU KNOW, OLD MAN

131
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,647
HAS GIVEN ME AN IDEA
FOR AN INEXPENSIVE
ANIMAL TRAP.

132
00:05:48,647 --> 00:05:49,982
ALL RIGHT.
NOW FOR STARTERS

133
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,583
YOU'RE GOING
TO NEED ONE OF
THESE HOSES HERE,

134
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:54,586
WHICH THEY USE TO CONNECT
FROM THE DRYER TO
THE OUTSIDE VENT

135
00:05:54,586 --> 00:05:56,755
AND YOU'RE GOING TO
NEED THE OUTSIDE VENT.

136
00:05:56,755 --> 00:05:59,057
YOU'RE IN LUCK, THOUGH,
BOTH OF THESE THINGS
ARE AVAILABLE

137
00:05:59,057 --> 00:06:01,260
IN MOST HOME
LAUNDRY ROOMS.

138
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,264
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT
YOU WAIT A FEW MINUTES

139
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,166
BECAUSE THESE THINGS
HAVE A WAY OF BUILDING UP

A CERTAIN
AMOUNT OF HEAT,

141
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,235
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE
DOING SAY A LIVING
ROOM RUG

142
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:12,337
OR YOUR WINTER UNDERWEAR
IN THERE ON THE HEAVY
DUTY CYCLE.

143
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:13,705
ALL RIGHT, NOW, THE FIRST
THING YOU GOT TO DO

144
00:06:13,705 --> 00:06:15,207
IS YOU GOT TO
CUT THE HOSE IN HALF,

145
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:20,612
WHICH ACTUALLY YOU
CAN DO BY BITING.

146
00:06:20,612 --> 00:06:24,116
YOU MAY FIND THAT
THERE'S A WIRE IN THERE,

147
00:06:24,116 --> 00:06:27,953
SO I WOULD SUGGEST
THAT TO AVOID BEING
PERMANENTLY FLOSSED,

148
00:06:27,953 --> 00:06:30,055
YOU EITHER USE SOMEBODY
ELSE'S TEETH

149
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:33,792
OR MAYBE SOME
SNIPS OF SOME KIND.

150
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:36,962
THERE WE GO.
ALL RIGHT.

151
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:39,765
NOW, IF YOU GOT ONE
OF THESE WELCOME MATS
OUT IN FRONT OF YOUR HOUSE,

152
00:06:39,765 --> 00:06:42,467
GET THAT OUT OF THERE
BEFORE IT DOES
ANYMORE DAMAGE.

153
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:44,102
AND YOU'RE GOING
TO ROLL THAT UP

154
00:06:44,102 --> 00:06:47,573
BECAUSE THAT IN FACT
IS GOING TO BECOME
THE CAGE

155
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,508
TO HOLD THE
TRAPPED ANIMALS.

156
00:06:49,508 --> 00:06:53,345
KIND OF THE WAY WELCOME
MATS ARE USED AT THE HOMES
OF LIFE INSURANCE SALESMEN.

157
00:06:53,345 --> 00:06:56,081
NOW TAKE YOUR
OUTSIDE VENT THING HERE,

158
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:58,650
YOU WANT TO HOOK THAT UP
TO ONE OF THE HALVES
OF THE DRYER HOSE.

159
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,852
AND THE WAY YOU CAN
CONNECT THOSE IS
KIND OF INTERESTING,

160
00:07:00,852 --> 00:07:02,654
THEY HAVE THESE LITTLE
PLASTIC HOSE CLAMPS,

161
00:07:02,654 --> 00:07:03,956
THEY'RE
UNBELIEVABLE THINGS.

162
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,891
THEY JUST SLIDE --
ONE SLIDES --

163
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:07,693
THESE SLIDES IN TOGETHER,
YOU PULL THAT UP
RIGHT THERE

164
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,494
AND BY GOLLY
THAT IS SOLID.

165
00:07:09,494 --> 00:07:11,830
YOU JUST WRAP THAT
AROUND THE HOSE.

166
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,967
ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUST
OPEN THAT UP A LITTLE BIT

167
00:07:22,474 --> 00:07:24,643
ALL RIGHT, I'M THINKING
MAYBE THIS IS NOT
THE BEST WAY

168
00:07:24,643 --> 00:07:28,714
TO ATTACH THE WHOLE
UNIT TOGETHER.

169
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,549
NO.

170
00:07:30,549 --> 00:07:34,820
I DECIDED TO USE THE
HANDYMAN'S SECRET
WEAPON, DUCT TAPE.

171
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,922
SO THERE'S OUR TRAP
PRETTY MUCH BUILT.

172
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:40,025
BUT YOU CAN'T JUST
HAVE IT SITTING OUT
IN THE WOODS LIKE THAT.

173
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:43,995
YOU'VE GOT TO BE SNEAKY
LIKE THOSE GUYS FROM
THE TAX DEPARTMENT.

174
00:07:43,995 --> 00:07:46,698
SO I'VE DECIDED
TO TAKE A PAGE OUT OF
OLD MAN SEDGEWICK'S BOOK,

175
00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:52,037
HIDE THE WHOLE TRAP
INSIDE A PAIR OF PANTS.

176
00:07:52,037 --> 00:07:57,109
THERE WE GO.

177
00:07:58,376 --> 00:07:59,945
COME ON OLD FELLA.

178
00:07:59,945 --> 00:08:02,948
LET'S GO.
LET'S GO.

179
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,085
AND THE ANIMALS AREN'T
GOING TO BE SUSPICIOUS

180
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:09,321
BECAUSE A PAIR OF PANTS
LYING IN THE WOODS

181
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:13,458
AROUND POSSUM LODGE IS
A PRETTY COMMON SIGHT.

182
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:16,628
HOWEVER, THEY ARE
GOING TO NEED SOME SORT
OF A CULINARY INCENTIVE

183
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:17,963
TO COME UP
THE PANT LEG.

184
00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:19,598
SO I WOULD SUGGEST
THAT YOU SWIPE AN
HOR D'OUVERS TRAY

185
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:21,666
FROM THE NEXT SOCIAL
FUNCTION THAT YOUR
WIFE DRAGS YOU OVER TO

186
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,401
AND PICK ONE OF
THESE UNITS UP

187
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:26,504
AND SEPARATE THE
TOOTHPICK FROM THE
HOR D'OUVERS ITSELF.

188
00:08:26,504 --> 00:08:28,373
THEN YOU TAKE THE
PANT LEG, AS I'VE
DONE HERE

189
00:08:28,373 --> 00:08:30,308
AND STICK THE HOR
D'OUVERS UP INSIDE

190
00:08:30,308 --> 00:08:33,411
AND YOU PUSH THE TOOTHPICK
DOWN THROUGH, THROUGH
THE PANT LEG,

191
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:36,681
THROUGH THE HOSE AND
INTO THE HOR D'OUVERS.

192
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:38,183
IF YOU DO ONE OF
THOSE EVERY FEW INCHES,

193
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:40,051
THEN THE ANIMAL WILL
WORK HIS WAY ALL
THE WAY UP

194
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:41,586
UNTIL YOU GET TO
THE DANGER AREA,

195
00:08:41,586 --> 00:08:43,088
WHICH IS THE CROTCH
OF THE PANTS,

196
00:08:43,088 --> 00:08:44,723
'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE
WELCOME MAT CAGE IS.

197
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:46,191
AND YOU WANT TO USE
MEN'S PANTS ON THIS

198
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:48,326
BECAUSE IF YOU HAPPEN
TO CATCH AN ANIMAL
THAT YOU DON'T WANT,

199
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:50,195
YOU CAN JUST
UNZIP THE FLY,

200
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:53,064
LIFT THE WELCOME FLAP
AND LET THE LITTLE
GUY GO,

201
00:08:53,064 --> 00:08:55,433
LIKE THEY DID IN
THAT MOVIE FREE WILLY.

202
00:08:55,433 --> 00:08:57,802
SO UNTIL NEXT TIME,
HAPPY HUNTING.
AND REMEMBER,

203
00:08:57,802 --> 00:08:59,704
IF THE WOMEN DON'T
FIND YOU HANDSOME,

204
00:08:59,704 --> 00:09:02,140
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

205
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,776
EXCUSE ME.

206
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:06,845
RED GREEN:
AND SPEAKING OF TRAPS,

207
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:08,246
WE'RE LIKE THE VON
TRAPP FAMILY HERE,

208
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:09,948
RANGER GORD HAS GOT
A BADGER TRAP

209
00:09:09,948 --> 00:09:20,091
AND BILL'S GOING TO MAKE
HIMSELF A SNAKE TRAP.

210
00:09:20,091 --> 00:09:22,093
I WANT TO TALK YOU
TO YOU MIDDLE AGE
GUYS OUT THERE.

211
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:24,362
YOU HEARD ANY GOOD RADIO
STATIONS LATELY?

212
00:09:24,362 --> 00:09:27,098
STATIONS THAT PLAY
GOOD DRIVING MUSIC?

213
00:09:27,098 --> 00:09:28,767
WELL, THERE AREN'T ANY.

214
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:30,902
IT'S ALL YACKETY-YACK NOW,

215
00:09:30,902 --> 00:09:33,738
NEWS, TALK SHOWS,
RAP MUSIC.

216
00:09:33,738 --> 00:09:35,173
DOESN'T IT MAKE
YOU WONDER,

217
00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:36,708
WHAT HAPPENED
TO OUR MUSIC?

218
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:37,976
WHERE DID IT GO?

219
00:09:37,976 --> 00:09:40,612
WHERE DID THE MUSIC
THAT DEFINED OUR
GENERATION GO?

220
00:09:40,612 --> 00:09:42,113
WELL, I KNOW
WHERE IT WENT

221
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:43,815
AND IT'S GOOD
NEWS FOR A CHANGE.

222
00:09:43,815 --> 00:09:45,950
OUR MUSIC IS ALL
SITTING IN THE
CLEARANCE BIN

223
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,486
DOWN AT THE LOCAL
HARDWARE STORE.

224
00:09:48,486 --> 00:09:50,388
YOU CAN ZIP DOWN
THERE RIGHT NOW

225
00:09:50,388 --> 00:09:52,123
AND PICK UP FIVE
MAYBE SIX TAPES

226
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:54,526
FOR THE PRICE OF
ONE OF THEM CD THINGS.

227
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:58,663
AND IT'S GREAT MUSIC
WITH WORDS YOU CAN
HEAR AND UNDERSTAND.

228
00:09:58,663 --> 00:10:02,333
WORDS THAT TELL A
STORY WITHOUT A VIDEO.

229
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,169
WHERE WOMEN SING
SONGS ABOUT MEN,

230
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:06,137
AND MEN SING SONGS
ABOUT WOMEN

231
00:10:06,137 --> 00:10:08,740
AND SURFING
AND HOT RODS.

232
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,176
I KNOW IT'S DEPRESSING
TO SEE THE MUSIC
OF YOUR LIFE

233
00:10:11,176 --> 00:10:13,111
STACKED BESIDE THE
DISCOUNT SHAMPOO

234
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:15,480
AND THE TWO-FOR-ONE
LIGHTBULBS.

235
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,448
BUT ON THE BRIGHT
SIDE ISN'T IT GREAT

236
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:19,350
WHEN THE TRULY REWARDING
THINGS IN LIFE

237
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,720
ARE GEARED TO A
PENSIONER'S INCOME?

238
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,822
REMEMBER, I'M
PULLING FOR YOU.

239
00:10:24,822 --> 00:10:27,358
WE'RE ALL IN
THIS TOGETHER.

240
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:34,565
WELL, THAT BADGER
IS STILL UP OLD MAN
SEDGEWICK'S PANT LEG.

241
00:10:34,565 --> 00:10:39,404
EVERY TIME IT TWITCHES
THE OLD FELLA GETS TICKLED
SOMETHING FIERCE.

242
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:40,905
CAN'T YOU GET IT OUT?

243
00:10:40,905 --> 00:10:43,274
WELL, WE TRIED, HAROLD.
DO YOU THINK WE WERE
JUST STANDING THERE

244
00:10:43,274 --> 00:10:45,576
LAUGHING AT HIM
NOT DOING ANYTHING?

245
00:10:45,576 --> 00:10:48,846
WELL, YOU WERE
FOR THE FIRST HOUR.

246
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:50,448
I KNOW, BUT THEN
HE OFFERED A REWARD

247
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:52,216
FOR ANYBODY WHO COULD
GET THE BADGER OUT
OF HIS PANTS

248
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:54,285
WITHOUT STARTLING
IT SO THAT IT
TURNS ON HIM.

249
00:10:54,285 --> 00:10:56,821
SO JUNIOR SINGLETON
THREADED THE BOAT HOOK
UP HIS PANT LEG THERE

250
00:10:56,821 --> 00:10:58,656
AND KIND OF GRABBED
ON AND TRIED TO
PULL IT OUT,

251
00:10:58,656 --> 00:11:01,693
BUT ALL HE GOT WAS OLD
MAN SEDGEWICK'S
UNDERWEAR.

252
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:03,961
WRECKED OUR
BEST BOAT HOOK.

253
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:06,064
OH, OH, UNCLE RED,
OH, I GOT AN IDEA.

254
00:11:06,064 --> 00:11:07,932
I WOULD TRY
TO LURE IT OUT.

255
00:11:07,932 --> 00:11:09,634
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
WE DID THAT HAROLD.

256
00:11:09,634 --> 00:11:11,502
BUSTER HADFIELD
CAUGHT A FEMALE
BADGER

257
00:11:11,502 --> 00:11:14,539
AND HE SET THAT UP JUST
OUTSIDE OF THE LEFT PANT
LEG OF OLD MAN SEDGEWICK.

258
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:16,340
THE TWO OF THEM STARTED
MAKING SOUNDS TO
EACH OTHER

259
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,243
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
THE FEMALE RUNS RIGHT
UP THE RIGHT PANT LEG.

260
00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:22,847
SO NOW HE'S GOT LIKE
TWO BADGERS UP
HIS PANTS?

261
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:25,983
YES, AND HE ISN'T
GLAD TO SEE US.

262
00:11:25,983 --> 00:11:27,819
BOY, THIS HAS
GOT TO END SOMEHOW.

263
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:30,421
WELL, WE'LL RUN OUT
OF ANIMALS EVENTUALLY.

264
00:11:32,623 --> 00:11:34,025
WINSTON ROTHCHILD HERE

265
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:36,861
OF ROTHCHILD'S SEWAGE
AND SEPTIC SUCKING SERVICES,

266
00:11:36,861 --> 00:11:40,031
REMINDING YOU, IF YOU
CAN'T BANK ON YOUR TANK,

267
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:43,935
WE'LL TAKE IT
FROM RANK TO SWANK.

268
00:11:43,935 --> 00:11:46,704
WE'RE UP HERE
AT FIRE TOWER 13
WITH RANGER GORD,

269
00:11:46,704 --> 00:11:48,473
A MAN LOOKING WHO'S
BEEN LOOKING OUT
OVER THE FOREST

270
00:11:48,473 --> 00:11:50,675
FOR A LONG,
LONG TIME.

271
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:54,078
16 YEARS ON THE
JOB, RED, AND NOT
A SINGLE DAY OFF.

272
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:56,147
NOT ONE SICK DAY,
NOT ONE VACATION DAY

273
00:11:56,147 --> 00:12:00,852
AND NOT ONE THANK YOU
FROM ANYONE, ANYWHERE,
ANYTIME, EVER.

274
00:12:00,852 --> 00:12:02,486
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.
FAIR ENOUGH.

275
00:12:02,486 --> 00:12:04,722
WELL, THEN, GORD, ON
BEHALF OF EVERYONE,

276
00:12:04,722 --> 00:12:08,392
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
OUT OVER THE FOREST.

277
00:12:08,392 --> 00:12:11,963
YOU'RE MOST WELCOME.

278
00:12:11,963 --> 00:12:13,364
OH, ALL RIGHT
THEN.
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

279
00:12:13,364 --> 00:12:15,233
NO, THAT'S FINE.
THAT'S FINE.

280
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:21,706
I SAID THAT'S FINE.
ALL RIGHT.

281
00:12:21,706 --> 00:12:26,510
OKAY, TODAY IN HONOUR
OF OLD MAN SEDGEWICK'S
PANTS,

282
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,046
I THOUGHT I WOULD
TALK ABOUT BADGERS.

283
00:12:29,046 --> 00:12:31,749
NOW I'VE GOT A BADGER
OVER HERE THAT I
TRAPPED LAST WEEK.

284
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:33,484
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE
TO TAKE A LOOK AT HIM.

285
00:12:33,484 --> 00:12:34,552
NO KIDDING.
YEAH.

286
00:12:34,552 --> 00:12:36,687
WOW.
EXCELLENT.

287
00:12:36,687 --> 00:12:38,155
YEAH.
COME ON UP HAROLD.

288
00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:41,325
NOW A FULL GROWN
BADGER CAN GROW UP
TO TWO FEET LONG.

289
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:43,628
OH, LOOKS LIKE HE GAVE
YOU THE SLIP THERE, GORD.

290
00:12:43,628 --> 00:12:45,963
OH, NO, THERE HE
IS RIGHT THERE.

291
00:12:45,963 --> 00:12:48,566
I'VE NAMED HIM TIGER.

292
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:50,234
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A BADGER.

293
00:12:50,234 --> 00:12:52,603
DON'T WORRY HE
WON'T HURT YOU.

294
00:12:52,603 --> 00:12:54,872
NO, NO, NO, I DON'T
THINK THAT'S A
BADGER AT ALL.

295
00:12:54,872 --> 00:12:56,140

LOOK AT HIM!

296
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,509

TRYING TO ESCAPE.
LOOK AT HIM.

297
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:01,779
HUH?
IS THAT
FUN OR WHAT?

298
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:04,949
HEY, YOU KNOW, I WAS
THINKING OF STARTING
A BADGER CLUB,

299
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:06,150
LETTING YOU GUYS JOIN,

300
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,519
AND YOU CAN HAVE ALL
YOUR CONVENTIONS
UP HERE, HUH?

301
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:09,720
HERE WE GO.
HERE WE GO.

302
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,190
THERE'S WHAT A
BADGER LOOKS LIKE.

303
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,325
A BADGER?

304
00:13:14,325 --> 00:13:18,129
OH, YEAH, THAT'S A
BADGER RIGHT THERE.

305
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:21,699
THEN I MUST HAVE
CAPTURED A WOLVERINE.

306
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:22,867
STAND BACK!

307
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:25,569
GET BACK HAROLD!

308

POTHOLES BY ME.

309
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,242
POTHOLES, POTHOLES
EVERYWHERE,

310
00:13:31,242 --> 00:13:32,676
EVERYWHERE I GO.

311
00:13:32,676 --> 00:13:35,613
IN THE CEILING UP ABOVE
AND IN THE FLOOR BELOW.

312
00:13:35,613 --> 00:13:38,749
IT SEEMS THAT I SEE
POTHOLES EVERYWHERE
I LOOK.

313
00:13:38,749 --> 00:13:40,451
MY WIFE SURE
TAKES IT BADLY

314
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:43,020
WHEN YOU TELL HER
SHE CAN'T COOK.

315
00:13:45,689 --> 00:13:46,924
RED GREEN:
EVERYBODY RELAX,

316
00:13:46,924 --> 00:13:53,531
IT'S TIME FOR
ADVENTURES WITH BILL.

317
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:56,734
WHAT THE HECK IS
HE DOING TODAY?

318
00:13:56,734 --> 00:13:57,935
OH MY GOSH.

319
00:13:57,935 --> 00:13:59,737
LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF THAT THING.

320
00:13:59,737 --> 00:14:01,872
OH BOY.

321
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:03,374
IT'S NOT BILL --
BILL, DON'T HURT IT.

322
00:14:03,374 --> 00:14:04,542
DON'T HURT IT.
DON'T HURT IT.

323

DON'T HURT IT.
DON'T HURT IT.

324
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:10,214
WELL, MAYBE HE'LL
GET THE LAWN CUT.

325
00:14:10,214 --> 00:14:11,649
OH, I SEE.
ALL RIGHT.

326
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:14,084
THIS IS ONE OF
THOSE INTERESTING
SNAKE TRAP THINGS

327
00:14:14,084 --> 00:14:18,088
THAT THEY'RE NOT AS
DANGEROUS AS THEY LOOK.

328
00:14:18,088 --> 00:14:20,691
WHAT HE DOES IS
HE GOT THE BOARD UP
AGAINST THE STOOL THERE

329
00:14:20,691 --> 00:14:23,060
AND THEN YOU GOT
THAT LITTLE PIECE
OF EAVESTROUGH.

330
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,230
AND WHAT HAPPENS IS
THE SNAKE COMES UP
THE BOARD, ALL RIGHT,

331
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,433
AND HE GOES UP AND HE
GOES INTO THE PIECE
OF EAVESTROUGH

332
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:31,068
AND HE CRAWLS ALONG
IN THERE

333
00:14:31,068 --> 00:14:32,670
AND ONCE HE GETS PAST
THE ROPE,

334
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,738
HIS OWN WEIGHT WILL
TIP THE EAVESTROUGH

335
00:14:34,738 --> 00:14:36,240
AND THE WHOLE SNAKE
AND THE WHOLE DEAL

336
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,508
WILL FALL DOWN
INTO THE GARBAGE CAN

337
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:39,243
AND YOU CAN'T
GET OUT OF THERE
AND YOU GOT 'EM.

338
00:14:39,243 --> 00:14:41,345
NOW THE TRICK IS YOU
GOT TO PUT SOME KIND
OF BAIT IN THERE

339
00:14:41,345 --> 00:14:43,414
FOR THE SNAKE,
SOMETHING TO ATTRACT HIM.

340
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:44,882
NO SNAKE WOULD GO IN --
THERE IT IS,

341
00:14:44,882 --> 00:14:46,283
THERE'S YOUR
SNAKE BAIT.

342
00:14:46,283 --> 00:14:47,685
TO GET HIM TO
GO IN THERE.

343
00:14:47,685 --> 00:14:51,321
NOW TO ME THIS LOOKS
LIKE A DOZEN LARGE EGGS

344
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:55,426
BUT THEN THEY CAN'T
CHARGE 15 BUCKS FOR A
DOZEN LARGE EGGS, CAN THEY?

345
00:14:55,426 --> 00:14:57,194
MAKE THAT 11.

346
00:14:57,194 --> 00:14:58,662
MAKE THAT 10.

347
00:14:58,662 --> 00:15:00,330
MEANWHILE WE DIDN'T
NOTICE THIS,

348
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,266
BUT THE SNAKE IS
ON HIS WAY UP.

349
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:05,102
SO I TELL YOU THAT SNAKE
BAIT WORKS, DOESN'T IT?

350
00:15:05,102 --> 00:15:07,471
WE WERE TRYING TO
GET ONE OUT OF THERE
WE CAN PUT INTO THE PIPE.

351
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:09,740
MEANWHILE THE SNAKE IS
GETTING RIGHT UP CLOSE
TO THE STOOL THERE.

352
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,609
AND OH, OH, I THINK
BILL'S GOT ONE.

353
00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:13,777
THERE WE GO.
THERE WE GO.

354

OH.
OH.

355
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:19,550
AND HE PUSHES THE ROPE
OFF AND NOW WE GOT --
OH BOY.

356
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,286
I GOT THE SNAKE BAIT.
ALMOST CALLED IT AN EGG.

357
00:15:22,286 --> 00:15:25,422
BUT BILL PICKED UP
THE SNAKE THINKING
IT WAS THE ROPE

358
00:15:25,422 --> 00:15:26,924
AND HE TRIES TO TIE
THAT ON THERE.

359
00:15:26,924 --> 00:15:28,992
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND
OF A KNOT YOU WOULD
USE WITH A SNAKE,

360
00:15:28,992 --> 00:15:30,294
I NEVER WENT THAT FAR
IN BOY SCOUTS,

361
00:15:30,294 --> 00:15:32,162
BUT I DO KNOW ONE THING,
I WOULDN'T MESS AROUND --

362
00:15:32,162 --> 00:15:33,363
BILL, THAT'S A SNAKE.

TO A WARM DARK PLACE, BILL.

THAT'S SOME INTERESTING
MOVES FOR A MAN HIS AGE.

ALWAYS WANTED TO DO.

WITH HIS BIG HOSE

AND HAROLD WILL
BE HERE DOING WHAT
HAROLD DOES BEST.

FROM BAD TO WORSE

378

WITH THE BADGERS IN OLD
MAN SEDGEWICK'S PANTS.

YOU MEAN THEY
STARTED TO MATE?

380
00:16:15,405 --> 00:16:18,575
NO, HAROLD, BUT
THAT'S OUR FAULT.

381
00:16:18,575 --> 00:16:20,344
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE SENT
THAT FEMALE UP THERE,

382
00:16:20,344 --> 00:16:22,112
WE THOUGHT THE FIRST
ONE WAS A MALE.

383
00:16:22,112 --> 00:16:24,414
SO NOW WHAT WE
GOT IS TWO FEMALE

00:17:28,945 --> 00:17:31,882
IT'S FROM
PORTLAND, OREGON.

409
00:17:31,882 --> 00:17:34,684
DEAR EXPERTS, WHAT WOULD
BE AN APPROPRIATE GIFT

410
00:17:34,684 --> 00:17:37,621
FOR MY WIFE ON OUR
25TH ANNIVERSARY?

411
00:17:37,621 --> 00:17:42,492
I WOULD RECOMMEND AN
OLYMPIC MEDAL FOR ENDURANCE.

412
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:46,329
IT WOULD HAVE
TO BE A SILVER MEDAL

413
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:51,601
BECAUSE THE 25TH
ANNIVERSARY IS SILVER.

414
00:17:54,137 --> 00:17:57,040
GOLD IS ACTUALLY 50
AND THEN 60 IS A DIAMOND

415
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,278
AND 100 I BELIEVE
IS KRYPTONITE.

416
00:18:02,078 --> 00:18:11,321
YEAH, I'D SUGGEST
A TOASTER.

417
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:13,356
A TOASTER
MR. HUMPHREY?

418
00:18:13,356 --> 00:18:14,958
YOU'D CELEBRATE LIKE
A QUARTER CENTURY

OF WEDDING BLISS
WITH A TOASTER?

00:18:17,594 --> 00:18:21,765
WELL, I'M TALKING
A FOUR SLICER.

421
00:18:21,765 --> 00:18:23,933
YOU KNOW, THAT SEEMS
A TAD CHINTZY TO
ME, DALTON.

422
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:25,802
YOU KNOW, I THINK THIS
GIFT HAS GOT TO BE
RIGHT UP THERE

ANNE-MARIE A WASHER.

430
00:18:45,588 --> 00:18:48,925
A WASHING MACHINE IS
NOT A VERY ROMANTIC

00:19:29,632 --> 00:19:36,406
AND ON OUR 20TH ANNIVERSARY
I GOT ANNE-MARIE A BRAND
NEW WASHER,

AND WHAT DID
SHE SAY TO THAT?

446
00:19:40,743 --> 00:19:42,845
WELL, NOTHING.
IT KINDA SURPRISED ME, TOO.

447
00:19:42,845 --> 00:19:45,381
SHE JUST BURST INTO
TEARS AND RAN UPSTAIRS.

448
00:19:45,381 --> 00:19:48,585

WHEN THEY'RE HAPPY.

TOO HAPPY TO ME

OH, NO, NO, SHE WAS.

452

CLEANED OUT OUR
BANK ACCOUNT

AND BOUGHT HERSELF A
BRAND NEW CAR TO MATCH IT.

THEN IT WAS YOUR TURN
TO BURST INTO TEARS.

OLD MAN SEDGEWICK SAFELY
AWAY FROM THOSE BADGERS.

HE WAITED UNTIL
THEY FELL ASLEEP

AND HE JUST SLIPPED
THE PANTS OFF.

WITHOUT DISTURBING THEM?

IN THERE SO LONG,
