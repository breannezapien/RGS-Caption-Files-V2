1
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:02,202
YOU EVER NOTICE HOW MANY BOAT

2
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:03,803
TRAILERS ARE LEFT AT THE SIDE

3
00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:05,372
OF THE ROAD BECAUSE THESE LITTLE

4
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:06,806
BABY WHEELS EITHER HAD A FLAT

5
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:08,575
OR FELL OFF?

6
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:09,409
I MEAN, THEY'RE LOUSY TIRES

7
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:10,677
TO BEGIN WITH, AND THEY'RE

8
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,278
SO SMALL THAT AT 100 KLICKS,

9
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:14,714
THEY'RE SPINNING FASTER THAN...

10
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:15,382
SOMETHING THAT SPINS

11
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:18,384
REALLY FAST.

12
00:00:18,384 --> 00:00:19,052
[metal crashing]

13
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,186
AND ONLY A DOOFUS WOULD CARRY

14
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,087
AROUND A SPARE

15
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:22,822
FOR A TRAILER TIRE.

16
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:23,690
WHERE WOULD YOU STICK THE JACK

17
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,959
ON ONE OF THESE BABIES ANYWAY?

18
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,460
NO, SIR.

19
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,095
I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

20
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:29,929
I MOUNTED A FEW OF THESE

21
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,664
HIGH-SPEED FANS ON THE SIDE

22
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:33,066
OF THE TRAILER.

23
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:33,733
KIND OF TURNED IT INTO

24
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,335
A HOVERCRAFT.

25
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:36,970
ONCE THESE THINGS GET GOING,

26
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:37,804
THE UNIT DOESN'T EVEN TOUCH

27
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:39,205
THE GROUND.

28
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,173
HOW CAN YOU HAVE A FLAT TIRE

29
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:43,276
WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A TIRE?

30
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:43,977
MAKES IT A LOT EASIER

31
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:47,347
FOR BACKING DOWN BOAT RAMPS TOO.

32
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:48,882
NOW, THE FANS ALL RUN OFF

33
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,283
THE JUICE FROM THE ALTERNATOR,

34
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:52,051
SO SOON AS I START THE ENGINE,

35
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,152
I'M IN BUSINESS.

36
00:00:53,152 --> 00:00:55,121
[engine turns over]

37
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:59,893
[fans humming]

38
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:18,678
[cheers and applause]

39
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,852
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

40
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:26,819
THANK YOU.

41
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:27,487
YEAH.

42
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,922
ALL RIGHT.

43
00:01:29,922 --> 00:01:30,890
WELL, I APPRECIATE THAT.

44
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,225
BIG, BIG WEEK UP AT THE LODGE

45
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:32,959
THIS WEEK.

46
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,494
POSSUM LAKE CITY COUNCIL

47
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:35,995
HAS FINALLY DECIDED TO START

48
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:37,563
PROMOTING THE AREA, AND THEY'RE

49
00:01:37,563 --> 00:01:38,731
LOOKING TO HIRE SOMEONE

50
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,867
AS A FULL-TIME P.R. PERSON.

51
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:41,834
WELL, SOUNDS LIKE PRETTY EASY

52
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:42,502
MONEY TO ME.

53
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,103
I MEAN, THE POSSUM LAKE AREA

54
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:45,705
PRETTY MUCH SELLS ITSELF--

55
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,174
USUALLY SHORT.

56
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:49,008
AND THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE

57
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,410
THAT I CAN TELL YOU.

58
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,278
THEY BUDGETED 50,000 BUCKS

59
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,246
A YEAR TO PAY WHOEVER GETS

60
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:53,913
THE JOB.

61
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:55,314
NOT EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT, BUT

62
00:01:55,314 --> 00:01:56,783
I'M PRETTY TIGHT WITH THE MAYOR.

63
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,550
ACTUALLY, MOST OF THE TIME,

64
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,451
THE MAYOR'S PRETTY TIGHT

65
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,219
ALL ON HIS OWN,

66
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:01,387
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

67
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:02,155
HEY, RED, ARE YOU STILL

68
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,423
PLANNING ON APPLYING FOR THE NEW

69
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,024
PUBLIC RELATIONS JOB, HUH?

70
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:06,125
WELL, I'M THINKING ABOUT IT,

71
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,293
DALTON, YEAH.

72
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,928
60,000 BUCKS A YEAR.

73
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:09,595
[laughs]

74
00:02:09,595 --> 00:02:10,263
OH, NO, NO.

75
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,030
NO, NO, NO.

76
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,764
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

77
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:12,799
NO, IT'S 50,000.

78
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,900
WELL, THAT'S INCORRECT,

79
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,567
MR. GREEN.

80
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:15,668
YOU SEE, THE MAYOR IS PLANNING

81
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:17,270
ON KEEPING $10,000 FOR HIMSELF,

82
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,404
SO HE LEAKED THE WRONG NUMBER

83
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:21,841
TO A FEW IDIOTS.

84
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,409
SO IF YOU GO UP FOR THIS JOB,

85
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:24,944
MR. GREEN, YOU HAVE TO PROPOSE

86
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,279
SOMETHING FOR THE AREA

87
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,213
THAT YOU WILL PROMOTE.

88
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:28,147
OH, NO, YEAH, I KNOW.

89
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:28,915
I'M ALL OVER THAT.

90
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:29,715
YEAH. NO.

91
00:02:29,715 --> 00:02:31,551
I'M SUGGESTING THAT THEY DECLARE

92
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,719
POSSUM LAKE THE MOSQUITO CAPITAL

93
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:36,055
OF THE WORLD.

94
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,924
EVERY SPRING, WE HAVE MOSQUITO

95
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:38,825
FESTIVAL, YOU KNOW?

96
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:39,926
MAKE IT A CHARITY THING.

97
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,795
RAISE MONEY FOR THE BLOOD BANK.

98
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:44,497
SO WE'RE ALL IN IT,

99
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,565
AND WE ALL GET SPONSORS.

100
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:46,666
YOU SIT IN THE BUSH

101
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,333
IN YOUR UNDERWEAR.

102
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,569
YOU GET A BUCK A BITE.

103
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,970
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

104
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:51,771
YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW

105
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,139
WHAT I THINK.

106
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,307
WELL, WE ACTUALLY--

107
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:55,107
WE CAN'T BE OBJECTIVE,

108
00:02:55,107 --> 00:02:56,108
MR. GREEN, 'CAUSE WE'RE BOTH

109
00:02:56,108 --> 00:02:57,810
CANDIDATES FOR THAT JOB TOO.

110
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,611
WHAT?

111
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,379
YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE ANY IDEAS.

112
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:01,747
WE GOT NO IDEAS FOR FREE.

113
00:03:01,747 --> 00:03:02,648
WE GOT PLENTY OF IDEAS

114
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:03,316
FOR MONEY.

115
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:06,419
YEAH, 60,000 OF THEM.

116
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:07,086
YEAH, AND APPARENTLY,

117
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:07,753
THE APPLICANTS

118
00:03:07,753 --> 00:03:09,055
WILL BE PROCESSED IN THE ORDER

119
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:10,690
IN WHICH THEY ARE SUBMITTED,

120
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,825
SO IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME...

121
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:15,528
[alarm beeps]

122
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,696
JUST A MINUTE THERE, GUYS.

123
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,264

124
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,166
OUT OF THE WAY.

125
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,034
[alarm beeps]

126
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:23,135
IT'S A REMOTE LOCK.

127

00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:26,572

A FREE STYLE AND SET FROM POSSUM

136

OKAY, MR. GREEN, YOU GOT 30

142
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,875
SECONDS TO GET WINSTON TO SAY

143
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,343
THIS WORD.

144
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:06,078
AMBITION!

145
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:07,713
AMBITION.

146
00:04:07,713 --> 00:04:08,414
YEAH, ALL RIGHT, MIKE.

00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,915
OKAY, AND GO!

148
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:11,317
OKAY, WINSTON, IF YOU DIDN'T

149
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,686
HAVE THIS, YOU'D BE NOTHING.

150
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,287
A SEWAGE TRUCK.

151
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:15,955
NO.

152
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:16,622
OKAY, NO, THIS IS NOT

153
00:04:16,622 --> 00:04:17,623
SOMETHING YOU OWN.

154
00:04:17,623 --> 00:04:18,791
THIS IS A THING INSIDE YOU

155
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,292
THAT HAS MADE YOU SUCCESSFUL.

156
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:23,329
OH, A POOR SENSE OF SMELL.

157
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,130
OKAY, SAY YOU'RE WATCHING

158
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,331
TELEVISION, YOU SEE SOMEBODY

159
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,298
LIKE DONALD TRUMP,

160
00:04:26,298 --> 00:04:27,533
AND YOU THINK, "BOY, HE MUST

161
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:28,734
HAVE A LOT OF..."

162
00:04:28,734 --> 00:04:31,337
HAIRSPRAY.

163
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,037
REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE

164
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:32,838
IN HIGH SCHOOL?

165
00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:33,873
THE GUIDANCE COUNSELOR WOULD

166
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,407
SAY, "WHAT'S YOUR..."

167
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:37,076
EXCUSE.

168
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:37,977
THIS IS NOT THE DREAM.

169
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:38,844
YOU GOT HAVE A DREAM, AND YOU

170
00:04:38,844 --> 00:04:39,912
GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING TO MAKE

171
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:40,746
THE DREAM COME TRUE.

172
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:41,547
HAPPY TALK!

173
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,048
HAPPY TALK

174
00:04:43,048 --> 00:04:44,516
KEEP TALKING HAPPY

175
00:04:44,516 --> 00:04:45,618
MIKE, MIKE.

176
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,585
I WAS IN SOUTH PACIFIC

177
00:04:46,585 --> 00:04:47,786
IN PRISON.

178
00:04:47,786 --> 00:04:51,557
I STILL GOT THE COCONUT BRA.

179
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:52,658
CAN WE PLEASE GET BACK

180
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:53,325
TO THE GAME?

181
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:53,993
OKAY, SORRY.

182
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:54,727
YOU'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME,

183
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:55,394
MR. GREEN.

184
00:04:55,394 --> 00:04:56,128
GEE, I WONDER WHY THERE,

185
00:04:56,128 --> 00:04:59,198
BOJANGLES.

186
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:00,065
ALL RIGHT, WINSTON, HOW COME

187
00:05:00,065 --> 00:05:01,533
YOU'RE THE ONLY SEWAGE SUCKER

188
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:03,235
IN THE WHOLE TRI-COUNTY AREA?

189
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:04,036
'CAUSE NOBODY AROUND HERE

190
00:05:04,036 --> 00:05:05,104
HAS ANY AMBITION!

191
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:05,771
THERE YOU GO!

192
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:07,740
[bell dinging]

193
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,081
I KNOW MY COMPETITORS

194
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:17,516
AND WHAT THEY'RE ABOUT.

195
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:18,917
THEY CHARGE TOO MUCH MONEY.

196
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:20,619
OF THAT, THERE'S NO DOUBT.

197
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:21,954
SO IF YOU WANT A FAIR PRICE,

198
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,522
GIVE ROTHSCHILD'S A SHOUT.

199
00:05:23,522 --> 00:05:24,990
DON'T GET SUCKED IN

200
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,959
WHEN YOU GET PUMPED OUT.

201
00:05:30,429 --> 00:05:31,263
LOT OF GOOD THINGS ABOUT

202
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,865
HAVING A DOG.

203
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,099
MAKE A GREAT COMPANION.

204
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:35,367
THEY'LL PROTECT YOU.

205
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:36,602
MAKE THE MAILMAN THINK TWICE

206
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,871
ABOUT DELIVERING THOSE BILLS.

207
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,372
PROBLEM IS, WHAT DO YOU DO

208
00:05:40,372 --> 00:05:42,107
WHEN THE DOG GETS DIRTY?

209
00:05:42,107 --> 00:05:44,576
NOBODY ENJOYS BATHING THEIR DOG.

210
00:05:44,576 --> 00:05:45,377
YOU GET SOAKED.

211
00:05:45,377 --> 00:05:46,078
YOU GET SCRATCHED.

212
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:46,812
THE DOG DOESN'T GET

213
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:48,514
ALL THAT CLEAN.

214
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,448
I SUPPOSE YOU COULD GET RIGHT

215
00:05:49,448 --> 00:05:51,316
INSIDE THE BATHTUB WITH THE DOG,

216
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:52,184
BUT THAT'S HOW YOU

217
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:53,152
END UP ON THE FRONT PAGE

218
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:56,922
OF THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER.

219
00:05:56,922 --> 00:05:58,390
NOW, I'M THINKING, WHY NOT TAKE

220
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,758
THE TECHNOLOGY OF AN AUTOMATIC

221
00:05:59,758 --> 00:06:01,160
CAR WASH--

222
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,161
MAKE YOURSELF AN AUTOMATIC

223
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,829
DOG WASH?

224
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:04,963
ALL YOU NEED IS THE STANDARD

225
00:06:04,963 --> 00:06:06,298
LAWN AND GARDEN STUFF THAT

226
00:06:06,298 --> 00:06:08,233
EVERYBODY HAS AROUND THEIR HOUSE

227
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:09,835
AND OF COURSE A COUPLE

228
00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:11,336
OF DOGHOUSES SO YOU GOT ROOM

229
00:06:11,336 --> 00:06:13,305
TO MOUNT ALL THE GEAR.

230
00:06:13,305 --> 00:06:14,006
NOW, I'M GONNA CUT THESE

231
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,208
DOGHOUSES IN HALF SO I CAN

232
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,177
GET INSIDE TO WORK ON THEM.

233
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:19,278
I SUPPOSE I COULD JUST CRAWL

234
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,445
RIGHT INSIDE THE DARN THINGS,

235
00:06:20,445 --> 00:06:22,447
BUT AFTER 35 YEARS OF MARRIAGE,

236
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:24,616
I BEEN IN THERE ENOUGH.

237
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:29,354
I THOUGHT I'D SHOW YOU

238
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:30,189
HOW THE WHOLE THING WORKS

239
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,823
BEFORE I PUT THE TWO HALVES

240
00:06:31,823 --> 00:06:32,925
BACK TOGETHER HERE.

241
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:33,592
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,

242
00:06:33,592 --> 00:06:35,194
I GOT MY GARDEN HOSE COMING IN.

243
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:35,861
GOES IN TO ONE OF THESE

244
00:06:35,861 --> 00:06:37,696
T-CONNECTORS HERE.

245
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:38,363
NOW, ON THE FIRST LEG OF

246
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:39,431
THE T-CONNECTOR, I'M GOING OUT

247
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:40,265
INTO ONE OF THESE

248
00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:42,100
OUTDOOR WINDOW WASHER BOTTLES.

249
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,901
YOU KNOW, THE KIND THAT HOOKS

250
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:43,936
ON TO YOUR HOSE?

251
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,070
COURSE, NOW, I DUMPED THE WINDOW

252
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,271
WASHER FLUID OUT OF THERE.

253
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,941
REPLACED THAT WITH DOG SHAMPOO.

254
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:50,275
THE DOG ACTUALLY TURNS THE SOAP

255
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:51,343
ON HIMSELF WITH THIS STRING

256
00:06:51,343 --> 00:06:52,778
I GOT TIED TO THE TRIGGER

257
00:06:52,778 --> 00:06:53,812
OF THE MACHINE, AND ON THE OTHER

258
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:55,547
END, I GOT A DOG BISCUIT

259
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:56,815
HANGING THERE.

260
00:06:56,815 --> 00:06:57,616
AND I'LL TELL YOU, BY THE TIME

261
00:06:57,616 --> 00:06:58,684
HE FINISHES CHEWING ON THAT

262
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,018
BABY, HE'LL HAVE WORKED HIMSELF

263
00:07:00,018 --> 00:07:01,586
INTO A LATHER.

264
00:07:01,586 --> 00:07:02,321
NOW, ON THE OTHER SIDE OF MY

265
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,256
T-CONNECTOR, THAT GOES DOWN INTO

266
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:05,190
THE LAWN SPRINKLER YOU SEE

267
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,658
THERE, AND THAT'LL RINSE

268
00:07:06,658 --> 00:07:08,060
ALL THE SOAP OFF THE DOG PLUS

269
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,394
GIVE HIM A GREAT UNDER-WASH

270
00:07:09,394 --> 00:07:11,630
FOR THOSE HARD-TO-GET-AT PLACES.

271
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,698
THEN HE JUST MOVES ON DOWN

272
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,232
THE LINE TILL HIS HEAD COMES UP

273
00:07:14,232 --> 00:07:15,467
AGAINST THE BLADE OF THIS HOCKEY

274
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:16,902
STICK, AND THAT TURNS ON MY

275
00:07:16,902 --> 00:07:18,503
LEAF BLOWER DOG DRYER.

276
00:07:18,503 --> 00:07:21,473
[blower hums]

277
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:23,909
OKAY, LET'S JUST GET

278
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:24,910
THE PIECES BACK TOGETHER,

279
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,878
AND WE'RE IN BUSINESS.

280
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:30,749
OKAY, I GOT THE DOG WASH

281
00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:31,950
BLOCKING THE ONLY EXIT

282
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,085
FROM THE YARD.

283
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,252
NOW I JUST NEED TO ENTICE

284
00:07:34,252 --> 00:07:36,621
THE DOG TO COME OUT THROUGH IT.

285
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:37,589
ACTUALLY, THERE ARE ONLY TWO

286
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:39,825
THINGS THAT'LL MOTIVATE A DOG,

287
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:40,726
AND SINCE THIS ISN'T MATING

288
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:43,895
SEASON, I'M GOING WITH FOOD.

289
00:07:43,895 --> 00:07:44,663
THAT'S ALL YOU NEED, THOUGH

290
00:07:44,663 --> 00:07:46,064
TO MAKE YOUR OWN DOG WASH,

291
00:07:46,064 --> 00:07:47,732
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN DON'T

292
00:07:47,732 --> 00:07:48,800
FIND YOU HANDSOME, THEY SHOULD

293
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,769
AT LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

294
00:07:53,972 --> 00:07:56,942

[cheers and applause]

297
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:27,005
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU

298
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:28,740
MIDDLE-AGED GUYS WITH GARAGES

299
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,442
OUT THERE.

300
00:08:30,442 --> 00:08:31,276
YOU KNOW, MY WIFE SAYS OUR

301
00:08:31,276 --> 00:08:32,344
GARAGE IS A MESS, BUT I DON'T

302
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:33,378
AGREE WITH HER.

303
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:34,546
SURE, I GOT SOME UNFINISHED

304
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:36,281
PROJECTS IN THERE.

305
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:37,549
PARKING METER WITH A DENT IN IT

306
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:41,319
THE SAME COLOR AS MY TRUCK.

00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:42,220
CHARRED PISTONS FROM

308
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,688
A FOUR-CYCLE ENGINE THAT TURNED

309
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:47,158
OUT TO BE A TWO-CYCLE ENGINE.

310
00:08:47,158 --> 00:08:48,226
REPLACEMENT TUBES FROM THAT

311
00:08:48,226 --> 00:08:49,728
GUITAR AMP THAT WAS REPO'D

312
00:08:49,728 --> 00:08:50,829
DURING MY SOLO

313
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:52,864
AT THE HIGH SCHOOL DANCE.

314
00:08:52,864 --> 00:08:54,199
BUT THAT STUFF IS COMPLETELY OUT

315
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:55,500
OF SIGHT, OR AT LEAST IT WOULD

316
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,234
BE IF I COULD GET THE GARAGE

317
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:58,103
DOOR TO CLOSE.

318
00:08:58,103 --> 00:08:58,970
BUT GARAGE CLUTTER

319
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,972
IS NOT A BAD THING.

320
00:09:00,972 --> 00:09:01,640
IF YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE

321
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,774
OF A MESS, YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE

322
00:09:02,774 --> 00:09:04,209
OF HISTORY.

323
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:05,210
OH, YEAH, IT'S THE STORY

324
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,444
OF EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED

325
00:09:06,444 --> 00:09:08,880
IN THAT GARAGE SINCE THE WORDS

326
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,081
"I'LL GET TO IT LATER"

327
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:13,418
WERE FIRST SPOKEN.

328
00:09:13,418 --> 00:09:14,686
AND CLUTTER IS BY FAR

329
00:09:14,686 --> 00:09:16,254
THE EASIEST ORGANIZATIONAL

330
00:09:16,254 --> 00:09:18,723
SYSTEM TO LEARN.

331
00:09:18,723 --> 00:09:20,125
WHY, WITH A CLEAN GARAGE, YOU

332
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,259
GOT TO REMEMBER WHICH CUPBOARD

333
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:23,428
THE TOOLS ARE IN.

334
00:09:23,428 --> 00:09:24,963
WITH A MESSY GARAGE, THEY'RE

335
00:09:24,963 --> 00:09:25,897
RIGHT WHERE YOU CAN SEE THEM,

336
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:26,765
LYING THERE RUSTING

337
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:29,634
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR.

338
00:09:29,634 --> 00:09:30,568
AND IT'S AMAZING WHAT YOU CAN

339
00:09:30,568 --> 00:09:32,070
CREATE JUST BY LEAVING STUFF

340
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,772
LYING AROUND.

341
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:35,140
YOU TAKE THAT GUY THAT INVENTED

342
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,108
CHIA PETS.

343
00:09:39,978 --> 00:09:40,845
I FIGURE IT WAS A BUNCH

344
00:09:40,845 --> 00:09:42,814
OF BROKEN LAWN GNOMES LYING

345
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:44,215
THERE BESIDE SOME SPILLED

346
00:09:44,215 --> 00:09:47,619
GRASS SEED UNDER A LEAKY ROOF.

347
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:48,453
I BUT THERE'S A BUNCH

348
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:49,487
OF MILLION DOLLAR PROJECTS

349
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:51,556
RIGHT IN MY GARAGE.

350
00:09:51,556 --> 00:09:52,490
ALL I GOT TO DO IS SORT

351
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,391
THROUGH THE CLUTTER.

352
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:54,626
[laughs]

353
00:09:54,626 --> 00:09:56,594
I'LL GET TO IT LATER.

354
00:09:56,594 --> 00:09:58,363
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

355
00:09:58,363 --> 00:10:00,331
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

356
00:10:04,702 --> 00:10:05,770
WHEN YOUR BACK LAWN'S AS HIGH

357
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,505
AS AN ELEPHANT'S EYE--

358
00:10:07,505 --> 00:10:08,840
WHEN STARLINGS AND SPARROWS

359
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,208
FALL FROM THE SKY--

360
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:10,942
IT'S TIME TO GIVE

361
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:13,178
ROTHSCHILD'S SEWAGE A TRY.

362
00:10:13,178 --> 00:10:14,445
WE'LL DIVE IN YOUR TANK

363
00:10:14,445 --> 00:10:16,414
AND SUCK HER DRY.

364
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:23,788
WELL, DIDN'T GET THE JOB,

365
00:10:23,788 --> 00:10:24,455
WHICH IS FINE.

366
00:10:24,455 --> 00:10:25,156
I DON'T MIND NOT GETTING

367
00:10:25,156 --> 00:10:26,658
THE JOB, BUT I THINK

368
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:28,192
THEY GAVE IT TO MIKE.

369
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:30,929
AW, COME ON.

370
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:32,564
I MEAN, MIKE'S A GOOD GUY

371
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:33,331
AND EVERYTHING, BUT THE MAN

372
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:35,633
IS A KNOWN THIEF.

373
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:36,334
WHY WOULD YOU GIVE

374
00:10:36,334 --> 00:10:38,069
A $60,000-A-YEAR JOB

375
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:38,903
TO A GUY WHO'S GOT

376
00:10:38,903 --> 00:10:40,338
NO EXPERIENCE, NO EDUCATION,

377
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:41,039
AND NO--

378
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:41,806
I HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME

379
00:10:41,806 --> 00:10:45,476
QUALIFICATIONS, AND I'M OLDER.

380
00:10:45,476 --> 00:10:47,045
I DIDN'T GET THE JOB EITHER,

381
00:10:47,045 --> 00:10:48,479
MR. GREEN.

382
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:49,147
OH, MIKE, I'M SORRY

383
00:10:49,147 --> 00:10:49,814
TO HEAR THAT.

384
00:10:49,814 --> 00:10:51,716
I WAS REALLY ROOTING FOR YOU.

385
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:53,318
THANKS.

386
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:54,419
YEAH, I GUESS DALTON MUST HAVE

387
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:55,420
GOT THE JOB.

388
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,721
WHAT A SCAM, EH?

389
00:10:56,721 --> 00:10:57,689
I MEAN, HE'S A GOOD GUY

390
00:10:57,689 --> 00:10:58,356
AND EVERYTHING.

391
00:10:58,356 --> 00:10:59,023
YEAH.

392
00:10:59,023 --> 00:10:59,691
BUT YOU COULDN'T HIRE

393
00:10:59,691 --> 00:11:00,758
A WORSE PERSON.

394
00:11:00,758 --> 00:11:01,492
OH, MAN, THERE'S A WASTE

395
00:11:01,492 --> 00:11:02,527
OF MONEY, MIKE, RIGHT THERE.

396
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,861
DALTON IS NOT THE GUY

397
00:11:03,861 --> 00:11:04,829
FOR THAT JOB!

398
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:05,763
DALTON'S AN IDIOT.

399
00:11:05,763 --> 00:11:09,600
YEAH.

400
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,401
A GOOD GUY, THOUGH.

401
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:11,235
GREAT GUY. SUPER GUY.

402
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:12,937
SUPER GUY. YEAH.

403
00:11:12,937 --> 00:11:13,638
WELL, COUNT ME OUT.

404
00:11:13,638 --> 00:11:14,505
I DIDN'T GET IT.

405
00:11:14,505 --> 00:11:15,306
OH, WHAT A SHAME.

406
00:11:15,306 --> 00:11:16,340
GEE, WE WERE REALLY HOPING

407
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,008
FOR YOU.

408
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:17,842
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GUYS.

409
00:11:17,842 --> 00:11:18,876
YEAH.

410
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:19,977
YEAH, THEY WOULDN'T EVEN TELL ME

411
00:11:19,977 --> 00:11:21,012
WHO DID GET IT.

412
00:11:21,012 --> 00:11:22,180
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

413
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,114
I THINK THEY MAYOR GAVE THE JOB

414
00:11:23,114 --> 00:11:24,515
TO HIS OWN WIFE.

415
00:11:24,515 --> 00:11:26,017
AW, NO, SHE'S ALREADY

416
00:11:26,017 --> 00:11:27,118
THE REGIONAL CHAIRPERSON.

417
00:11:27,118 --> 00:11:27,785
THAT'S HOW THE MAYOR

418
00:11:27,785 --> 00:11:30,054
GOT HIS JOB.

419
00:11:30,054 --> 00:11:30,988
[knocking on door]

420
00:11:30,988 --> 00:11:32,423
I'LL GET IT.

421
00:11:32,423 --> 00:11:33,091
WELL, SOUNDS TO ME

422
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:34,258
LIKE SOMEBODY'S BEEN PAID OFF.

423
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:35,059
NO, THEY WOULDN'T

424
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:36,928
TAKE A BRIBE.

425
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:40,164
I WOULDN'T THINK.

426
00:11:40,164 --> 00:11:41,833
GENTLEMEN, I'M PLEASED

427
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,401
TO PRESENT THE NEWLY-APPOINTED

428
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:44,735
DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC RELATIONS

429
00:11:44,735 --> 00:11:46,871
FOR THE COUNTY OF POSSUM LAKE.

430
00:11:48,606 --> 00:11:52,310
[cheers and applause]

431
00:11:55,346 --> 00:11:57,315
I GOT A JOB!

432
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,754
WALTER WANTED TO PUT A GARDEN

433
00:12:03,754 --> 00:12:05,389
IN BEHIND THE LODGE, SO HE GOT

434
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:06,390
ONE OF THE ROTOTILLERS THERE,

435
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,425
'CAUSE APPARENTLY THAT'S CHEAPER

436
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:09,293
THAN BUYING VEGETABLES.

437
00:12:09,293 --> 00:12:11,162
AND THE PROBLEM WAS, EVERY TIME

438
00:12:11,162 --> 00:12:12,163
HE PUT HER INTO GEAR, SHE WOULD

439
00:12:12,163 --> 00:12:13,331
STALL OUT ON HIM THERE.

440
00:12:13,331 --> 00:12:13,998
SO HE'D GET HER GOING,

441
00:12:13,998 --> 00:12:14,899
HE'D PUT HER INTO GEAR,

442
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:15,566
AND SHE'D STALL OUT.

443
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:16,534
SO THEN HE GOT A GOOD IDEA.

444
00:12:16,534 --> 00:12:18,469
HE FIGURED HE NEEDS SOME WAY

445
00:12:18,469 --> 00:12:19,170
TO KEEP HER IN GEAR

446
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,405
ALL THE TIME,

447
00:12:21,405 --> 00:12:23,407
SO HE INSTALLED THE HANDYMAN'S

448
00:12:23,407 --> 00:12:25,977
SECRET CLUTCH, BUT NOW HE'S JUST

449
00:12:25,977 --> 00:12:26,677
GOT TO FIRE THAT--

450
00:12:26,677 --> 00:12:28,012
FIRE IT UP, WALTER.

451
00:12:28,012 --> 00:12:28,846
LET HER RIP. LET HER GO.

452
00:12:28,846 --> 00:12:30,348
LET HER GO.

453
00:12:30,348 --> 00:12:31,382
APPARENTLY, THAT'S THE MANUAL

454
00:12:31,382 --> 00:12:34,452
ROTOTILLER TECHNIQUE.

455
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:35,620
SO HE OPENS UP THE--

456
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,554
AND APPARENTLY HE'S OUT OF--

457
00:12:36,554 --> 00:12:37,388
YEAH, HE'S OUT OF--

458
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:38,923
NOT A DROP IN THERE, AND SO HE

459
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:40,424
GOES TO THE SHED WHERE WE KEEP

460
00:12:40,424 --> 00:12:41,592
THE GAS CAN.

461
00:12:41,592 --> 00:12:42,760
YOU NOTICE I SAID "GAS CAN."

462
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,495
NOT GAS, 'CAUSE IT'S--

463
00:12:44,495 --> 00:12:45,696
YES, EMPTY AS WELL,

464
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:46,664
BUT THERE'S OTHER--

465
00:12:46,664 --> 00:12:47,665
THERE'S ALWAYS A LIQUID

466
00:12:47,665 --> 00:12:48,599
OF SOME KIND, AND MOST OF THEM

467
00:12:48,599 --> 00:12:49,300
ARE FLAMMABLE.

468
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,102
AND THERE'S A CAN WITH

469
00:12:51,102 --> 00:12:53,170
SOMETHING IN IT.

470
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,105
KIND OF A POTLUCK APPROACH

471
00:12:54,105 --> 00:12:55,840
TO INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES

472
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,608
WE USE AT THE LODGE.

473
00:12:57,608 --> 00:12:58,275
PLUS HE'S NOT PUTTING

474
00:12:58,275 --> 00:12:58,943
THAT MUCH IN.

475
00:12:58,943 --> 00:12:59,610
HOW MUCH DAMAGE

476
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,277
COULD HE POSSIBLY--

477
00:13:00,277 --> 00:13:01,045
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S--

478
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:01,712
WHATEVER IT IS,

479
00:13:01,712 --> 00:13:02,546
I'M PRETTY SURE--

480
00:13:02,546 --> 00:13:05,383
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT WOULD BURN.

481
00:13:05,383 --> 00:13:08,252
OH, YEAH, THAT'S FLAMMABLE.

482
00:13:08,252 --> 00:13:09,520
NOW, HE'S PROBABLY TRIPLED

483
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,788
THE HORSEPOWER OF THE UNIT

484
00:13:10,788 --> 00:13:12,256
RIGHT NOW, BUT--

485
00:13:12,256 --> 00:13:13,357
WHICH HE FINDS OUT AT THIS--

486
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:14,992
SO HE APPARENTLY TAKES OFF ON--

487
00:13:14,992 --> 00:13:16,460
I WAS JUST GETTING A SHOVEL

488
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,962
OUT OF THE VAN AND NOT PAYING

489
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:20,030
TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO WHAT WAS--

490
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,398
HELLO, WALTER.

491
00:13:21,398 --> 00:13:23,434
AND DALTON WAS PUTTING OUT--

492
00:13:23,434 --> 00:13:24,368
HE LOVES THESE LITTLE

493
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:25,202
LAWN ORNAMENTS.

494
00:13:25,202 --> 00:13:26,937
HE'S BEEN COLLECTING THESE FOR

495
00:13:26,937 --> 00:13:28,839
YEARS, BUT WALTER HAD THE THEORY

496
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:31,642
THAT IF YOU BROKE THEM DOWN,

497
00:13:31,642 --> 00:13:32,710
YOU COULD ACTUALLY USE THEM

498
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,346
AS SEEDS.

499
00:13:35,346 --> 00:13:36,213
THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT SO GOOD.

500
00:13:36,213 --> 00:13:36,947
THEN I WAS JUST PUTTING

501
00:13:36,947 --> 00:13:38,849
THE SHOVEL AWAY, AND THEN WALTER

502
00:13:38,849 --> 00:13:41,585
DECIDED TO PUT IN A ROOF GARDEN.

503
00:13:41,585 --> 00:13:43,721
AND HE'S UP THERE HACKING AWAY

504
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:46,023
AT THE SHINGLES, AND...

505
00:13:46,023 --> 00:13:47,458
THIS IS NOT GONNA WORK OUT

506
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,460
AT ALL, SO I'M GONNA--

507
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,327
THE BEST ADVICE I COULD GIVE HIM

508
00:13:50,327 --> 00:13:51,362
WAS YOU COME ON DOWN, WALTER.

509
00:13:51,362 --> 00:13:53,797
HERE YOU GO.

510
00:13:53,797 --> 00:13:54,632
BUT BY GOLLY, THE UNIT--

511
00:13:54,632 --> 00:13:55,699
YOU KNOW, SHE'S A GOOD ONE.

512
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:58,002
SHE KEPT RUNNING, AND HE WASN'T

513
00:13:58,002 --> 00:13:59,270
HEADING OUT TOWARDS THE HIGHWAY,

514
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,472
SO I WASN'T TOO WORRIED.

515
00:14:01,472 --> 00:14:02,439
THEN I GOT THIS IDEA: IF WE PUT

516
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:03,574
A RAMP UP AGAINST THE BACK

517
00:14:03,574 --> 00:14:04,842
OF THE POSSUM VAN THERE, AND IF

518
00:14:04,842 --> 00:14:05,876
WE COULD STEER HIM IN THAT WAY,

519
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:06,710
HE'S JUST GONNA GO RIGHT UP,

520
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,478
AND THEN THAT'LL BE

521
00:14:07,478 --> 00:14:08,212
KIND OF A HOLDING.

522
00:14:08,212 --> 00:14:09,113
AND THE FIRST YOU GOT TO DO--

523
00:14:09,113 --> 00:14:10,281
YOU GOT TO LET GO, WALTER.

524
00:14:10,281 --> 00:14:11,916
YOU GOT TO LET GO OF THE UNIT.

525
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:12,583
TAKE YOUR HAND--

526
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:13,250
LET HER GO. LET HER GO.

527
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:13,918
LET HER GO, WALTER.

528
00:14:13,918 --> 00:14:14,585
THERE YOU GO.

529
00:14:14,585 --> 00:14:15,786
OH! OKAY, VERY GOOD.

530
00:14:15,786 --> 00:14:17,087
AND...

531
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,821
NOW, THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS,

532
00:14:17,821 --> 00:14:19,123
THE UNIT DIDN'T ACTUALLY

533
00:14:19,123 --> 00:14:19,890
STOP RUNNING.

534
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:20,724
SHE'S CHEWING UP THE SEATS

535
00:14:20,724 --> 00:14:21,392
IN THERE.

536
00:14:21,392 --> 00:14:22,760
TURNING AROUND, WHICH WE DIDN'T

537
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,928
NOTICE, AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,

538
00:14:23,928 --> 00:14:25,496
SHE STARTS COMING BACK DOWN

539
00:14:25,496 --> 00:14:27,598
THE RAMP TOWARDS US, BUT,

540
00:14:27,598 --> 00:14:29,967
YOU KNOW, AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT,

541
00:14:29,967 --> 00:14:31,168
SHE RAN OUT OF GAS,

542
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:33,137
AND SO DID DALTON.

543
00:14:35,406 --> 00:14:38,309
[cheers and applause]

544
00:14:43,647 --> 00:14:44,548
THIS IS THE REPAIR SHOP

545
00:14:44,548 --> 00:14:45,683
PART OF THE SHOW WE CALL

546
00:14:45,683 --> 00:14:46,884
"IF IT AIN'T BROKE,

547
00:14:46,884 --> 00:14:49,253
YOU'RE NOT TRYING."

548
00:14:49,253 --> 00:14:51,221
JOINING ME TODAY IS LOCAL MARINA

549
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:52,556
OWNER AND HAMMOCK ENTHUSIAST

550
00:14:52,556 --> 00:14:53,223
DWIGHT CARDIFF.

551
00:14:53,223 --> 00:14:55,292
SO TELL ME, DWIGHT, HOW ARE

552
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:56,660
THINGS AT THE MARINA THESE DAYS?

553
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,562
OH, BEEN BETTER, RED.

554
00:14:58,562 --> 00:14:59,697
WE LOST PART OF THE FLEET

555
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:01,098
OVER THE WEEKEND.

556
00:15:01,098 --> 00:15:01,932
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

557
00:15:01,932 --> 00:15:02,800
THE BOATS SANK?

558
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,734
NO, THEY JUST KIND OF

559
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:06,637
FLOATED AWAY.

560
00:15:06,637 --> 00:15:07,371
WELL, YOU KNOW, DWIGHT,

561
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:08,205
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TIE THEM UP

562
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:09,473
TO THE DOCK, EH?

563
00:15:09,473 --> 00:15:13,377
I'M NOT BIG ON BENDING.

564
00:15:13,377 --> 00:15:15,312
WELL, YOU GOT A BAD BACK?

565
00:15:15,312 --> 00:15:18,348
I HAVE NO IDEA.

566
00:15:18,348 --> 00:15:19,650
ALL RIGHT, WELL, WHAT DID YOU

567
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:20,951
BRING US HERE TODAY?

568
00:15:20,951 --> 00:15:21,885
GARBURATOR.

569
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:23,320
SHE'S JAMMED.

570
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,054
WELL, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO

571
00:15:24,054 --> 00:15:25,088
BRING THE WHOLE SINK

572
00:15:25,088 --> 00:15:25,789
IN HERE, DWIGHT.

573
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:26,523
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN ACTUALLY

574
00:15:26,523 --> 00:15:27,624
JUST TAKE THE GARBURATOR

575
00:15:27,624 --> 00:15:28,859
OFF THE BOTTOM.

576
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:31,094
WELL, HOW WOULD I DO THAT?

577
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:32,029
WELL, YOU OPEN THE CUPBOARD

578
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:32,763
DOORS UNDER THE SINK,

579
00:15:32,763 --> 00:15:34,164
AND THEN YOU BEND--OKAY.

580
00:15:34,164 --> 00:15:36,300
YEP.

581
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,801
WELL...

582
00:15:37,801 --> 00:15:38,602
GOT A PAIR OF NEEDLE-NOSE

583
00:15:38,602 --> 00:15:39,269
PLIERS HERE.

584
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:40,137
SEE IF I CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT'S

585
00:15:40,137 --> 00:15:41,271
JAMMING HER.

586
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:41,939
YOU KNOW, I THINK I GOT

587
00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:42,973
A PAIR OF THOSE IN THE SHOP

588
00:15:42,973 --> 00:15:43,874
AT THE MARINA.

589
00:15:43,874 --> 00:15:44,541
I'M NOT SURE.

590
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:48,212
I DON'T GO IN THERE VERY MUCH.

591
00:15:48,212 --> 00:15:49,112
THERE WE GO.

592
00:15:49,112 --> 00:15:50,414
HUH?

593
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:51,748
THERE'S YOUR TYPICAL GARBURATOR

594
00:15:51,748 --> 00:15:52,516
JAM RIGHT THERE.

595
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:54,017
IT'S A TAB OFF A POP CAN.

596
00:15:54,017 --> 00:15:55,085
SEE THAT?

597
00:15:55,085 --> 00:15:56,553
BOY, THOSE POP CANS JUST ARE

598
00:15:56,553 --> 00:15:58,589
TOO MUCH WORK, AREN'T THEY?

599
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:03,193
ACTUALLY, THE WHOLE CAN IS

600
00:16:03,193 --> 00:16:04,194
IN THERE, DWIGHT.

601
00:16:04,194 --> 00:16:06,663
I KNOW WHAT CAUSED THAT, RED:

602
00:16:06,663 --> 00:16:07,931
GRAVITY.

603
00:16:07,931 --> 00:16:09,633
I THINK THE--

604
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:10,500
I THINK THE MARINA'S

605
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,236
A GRAVITY HOTSPOT.

606
00:16:13,236 --> 00:16:14,504
SOME DAYS, I CAN BARELY GET OUT

607
00:16:14,504 --> 00:16:16,473
OF MY CHAIR.

608
00:16:17,874 --> 00:16:18,875
THAT WOULD BE A MILK CARTON,

609
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,011
DWIGHT.

610
00:16:21,011 --> 00:16:22,312
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

611
00:16:22,312 --> 00:16:22,980
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING

612
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,281
TO SAY, RED?

613
00:16:24,281 --> 00:16:25,248
YOU THINK I'M SHOVING ALL--

614
00:16:25,248 --> 00:16:26,483
STUFFING ALL MY GARBAGE

615
00:16:26,483 --> 00:16:28,585
DOWN THE GARBURATOR?

616
00:16:28,585 --> 00:16:29,519
I THINK YOU'RE STUFFING--

617
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,387
YES.

618
00:16:30,387 --> 00:16:31,054
EXACTLY RIGHT.

619
00:16:31,054 --> 00:16:31,722
YOU'RE NOT GETTING THIS

620
00:16:31,722 --> 00:16:32,389
BACK, DWIGHT.

621
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:33,056
I'M CONFISCATING

622
00:16:33,056 --> 00:16:34,224
THE GARBURATOR, OKAY?

623
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:34,891
YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT.

624
00:16:34,891 --> 00:16:35,625
FROM NOW ON, YOU PUT YOUR

625
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,560
GARBAGE OUT ON GARBAGE DAY

626
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,828
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

627
00:16:37,828 --> 00:16:38,662
HAVE YOU SEEN THE LENGTH

628
00:16:38,662 --> 00:16:40,797
OF MY DRIVEWAY?

629
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:41,531
I DON'T CARE, DWIGHT.

630
00:16:41,531 --> 00:16:42,199
YOU'RE NOT GETTING

631
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:43,066
THE GARBURATOR BACK,

632
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:44,334
AND THAT IS FINAL.

633
00:16:44,334 --> 00:16:46,303
FINE, FINE.

634
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,208
ON A COMPLETELY UNRELATED

635
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,776
SUBJECT, DO YOU KNOW HOW

636
00:16:52,776 --> 00:16:54,478
TO BUILD A CATAPULT?

637
00:16:54,478 --> 00:16:56,947
GET OUT.

638
00:16:56,947 --> 00:16:57,881
[explosion]

639
00:16:57,881 --> 00:16:59,049
DOES IT BOTHER YOU WHEN YOUR

640
00:16:59,049 --> 00:17:00,317
WIFE STARTS LOOKING AT PICTURES

641
00:17:00,317 --> 00:17:02,786
OF FANCY MANSIONS IN MAGAZINES,

642
00:17:02,786 --> 00:17:04,755
THEN SHE LOOKS AT YOUR HOUSE,

643
00:17:04,755 --> 00:17:06,823
THEN SHE LOOKS AT YOU?

644
00:17:06,823 --> 00:17:07,491
WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT

645
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:08,425
IF YOU COULD IMPRESS PEOPLE

646
00:17:08,425 --> 00:17:09,359
WITH YOUR HOUSE?

647
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,060
NOW, I DON'T MEAN FRIENDS

648
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,128
AND NEIGHBORS.

649
00:17:11,128 --> 00:17:12,229
I'M TALKING ABOUT STRANGERS

650
00:17:12,229 --> 00:17:14,164
WHO LIVE FAR, FAR AWAY.

651
00:17:14,164 --> 00:17:14,965
YOU HAVE ZERO CHANCE

652
00:17:14,965 --> 00:17:15,765
OF IMPRESSING ANYBODY

653
00:17:15,765 --> 00:17:17,968
WHO ACTUALLY KNOWS YOU.

654
00:17:17,968 --> 00:17:18,935
THEY SAY A PICTURE SAYS

655
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:20,570
1,000 WORDS.

656
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:21,371
WELL, HOW ABOUT A PICTURE

657
00:17:21,371 --> 00:17:23,373
THAT TELLS 1,000 LIES?

658
00:17:23,373 --> 00:17:24,774
FIND YOURSELF A SHOT OF ONE

659
00:17:24,774 --> 00:17:25,709
OF THOSE FANCY MANSIONS IN

660
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:27,577
THE MAGAZINE, THEN TAKE A KNIFE

661
00:17:27,577 --> 00:17:28,912
AND CUT OUT WHERE THE FRONT

662
00:17:28,912 --> 00:17:31,681
DOOR IS ON THAT UNIT.

663
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:33,817
JUST LIKE THAT.

664
00:17:33,817 --> 00:17:35,785
OH, LOOK, I'M HOME.

665
00:17:35,785 --> 00:17:36,720
THEN WHAT YOU DO IS FIND

666
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,088
SOMEBODY WHO CAN TAKE A PICTURE

667
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:40,156
FOR YOU AND GET THEM TO LINE

668
00:17:40,156 --> 00:17:42,559
THAT MANSION UP JUST RIGHT.

669
00:17:44,461 --> 00:17:45,362
WHAT YOU'LL GET IS A PICTURE

670
00:17:45,362 --> 00:17:46,396
OF YOU AT YOUR FRONT DOOR

671
00:17:46,396 --> 00:17:47,564
THAT YOU CAN PROUDLY SEND

672
00:17:47,564 --> 00:17:49,799
TO RELATIVES OVERSEAS AS LONG

673
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:50,600
AS YOU'RE POSITIVE THEY'LL

674
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,569
NEVER COME AND VISIT YOU.

675
00:17:59,342 --> 00:18:01,311
[camera shutter clicks]

676
00:18:06,216 --> 00:18:07,984
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, UNCLE RED?

677
00:18:07,984 --> 00:18:08,718
WELL, HAROLD, IT'S A LOT

678
00:18:08,718 --> 00:18:09,919
FOR ME TO TAKE IN.

679
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,989
IT'S A LOT FOR ME TO PUT OUT.

680
00:18:12,989 --> 00:18:13,923
WHY ARE YOU HERE, HAROLD?

681
00:18:13,923 --> 00:18:14,624
