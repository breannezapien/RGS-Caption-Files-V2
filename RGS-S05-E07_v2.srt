1
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:08,208
(Snoring and sputtering)

2
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:10,610
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

3
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,545
NOW, THE MAN WHO CHANGED

4
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:14,080
THE FACE OF TELEVISION,

5
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,748
GIVING IT A FAT LIP

6
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:17,250
AND A BLACK EYE,

7
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:20,720
YOUR HOST, MY UNCLE, RED GREEN!

8
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:23,690
(Applause)

9
00:00:23,756 --> 00:00:29,195
(Cheering and whistling)

10
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:30,730
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

11
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:32,799
THANK YOU -- APPRECIATE IT.

12
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,801
GOT SOME REALLY GOOD NEWS.

13
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,836
I AM SO TOTALLY EXCITED.

14
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:38,338
WAAAAHH!

15
00:00:38,404 --> 00:00:40,373
FINE, THAT'S FINE, HAROLD.

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,941
YEP, YEP, THIS WEEK,

17
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:43,910
WE'LL HAVE THE FIRST EVER

18
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:46,980
POSSUM LODGE
INFLATED HIP-WADER CONTEST.

19
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,448
WHAT? WHAT? NO.

20
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:51,451
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE FACT
THAT AN AMERICAN NETWORK

21
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,386
IS MILDLY INTERESTED
IN OUR SHOW.

22
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:54,721
WHAT?

23
00:00:54,787 --> 00:00:57,323
YEAH, OH, YES,
HOW TRUE, HOW TRUE.

24
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,025
ONE OF THE BIG THREE.

25
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,360
THEY MIGHT PICK US UP.

26
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:01,628
YOU COULD BE FAMOUS.

27
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:04,163
THE NETWORK EXECUTIVES THINK
YOU'RE QUIRKY.

28
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,065
I'M NOT QUIRKY, HAROLD.

29
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:09,602
THE BUNCH OF GUYS
ARE GONNA PUT ON HIP-WADERS,

30
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:14,173
PACK 'EM FULL OF DRY ICE,
AND WHEN THE CO2 TURNS TO GAS,

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,675
WOOF! OUT THEY GO,

32
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,344
AND WHOEVER GETS
THE BIGGEST DIAMETER

33
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,747
WITHOUT BLOWING 'EM UP... WINS!

34
00:01:20,813 --> 00:01:22,815
SEE, I'M NOT QUIRKY.

35
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:25,652
RIGHT, YEAH, RIGHT.

36
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:30,657
(Horns honking)

37
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:33,259
(Geese honking)

38
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,763
(Quacking)

39
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:44,037
(Red): THIS WEEK, WE GOT
A REAL SURPRISE FOR YOU.

40
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:46,105
YOU THINK THAT'S IT?

41
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,007
NO, THAT'S NOT IT.

42
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:52,011
WE'RE GETTING CLOSE,
BUT THAT'S NOT IT.

43
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,781
I'LL GIVE YOU A GREAT BIG HINT.

44
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:03,156
IF I'M GONNA WIN THE INFLATED
HIP-WADERS CONTEST,

45
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:05,658
BETTER MAKE SURE
I HAVEN'T GOT BLISTERS.

46
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,393
YOU DON'T WANT A WEAK SPOT.

47
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,897
SHE LETS GO AT FULL PRESSURE,
BLOW YOU ACROSS THE LAKE.

48
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,966
JUNIOR SINGLETON, TO TEST HIS,

49
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:15,435
HE POURED IN
A 2-4 OF THE LIGHT BEER,

50
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:16,903
LET 'ER FIZZ AROUND--

51
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,605
EXCUSE ME,
UNCLE RED.

52
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:20,306
"2-4" IS
LOCAL SLANG.

53
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,775
IF WE WANT
A BIG NETWORK DEAL,

54
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:25,945
WE HAVE TO TAILOR THE SHOW
A BIT THAT WAY.

55
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:29,082
SO CAN YOU SAY "CASE"
INSTEAD OF 2-4, OK?

56
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:31,084
YOU SAID I WOULDN'T HAVE TO
CHANGE THE SHOW.

57
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,086
NO, NOT CHANGE, NEVER CHANGE.

58
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:35,922
THE NETWORK EXECS
THINK YOU'RE QUIRKY.

59
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,324
KEEP THE QUIRK, KEEP THE QUIRK.

60
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,526
JUST TAILOR IT A BIT -- TAILOR.

61
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,999
ALL RIGHT, JUNIOR POURED
A
 CASE
 OF BEER IN,

62
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,934
AND IT WAS ALMOST FREEZING.

63
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,869
IT WAS ONE OR TWO DEGREES--

64
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,205
EXCUSE ME, UNCLE RED.

65
00:02:52,271 --> 00:02:53,873
IS THAT, LIKE, CELSIUS?

66
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,375
YEAH.

67
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,377
CELSIUS MIGHT CONFUSE
AMERICAN VIEWERS.

68
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:58,878
THEY STILL USE FAHRENHEIT.

69
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,246
CAN YOU USE FAHRENHEIT?

70
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,382
FAHRENHEIT DOESN'T CHANGE
THE STORY.

71
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:05,318
YEAH, SEE? WORKS FOR ME.

72
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,653
WAIT A SEC, HAROLD.

73
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,655
TOOK ME 12 YEARS
TO CHANGE OVER.

74
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:09,989
I WON'T CHANGE BACK.

75
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,557
NOT CHANGE, NEVER CHANGE.

76
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,926
JUST SAY, UH...
JUST SAY "FAHRENHEIT".

77
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,528
LET ME TELL
YOU SOMETHING.

78
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:18,398
I LOVE THE AMERICANS --
I'M REALLY HAPPY

79
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,366
AMERICANS ARE WATCHING
OUR SHOW.

80
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,868
I WON'T CHANGE MY TUNE.

81
00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:25,171
MY TUNE HAPPENS TO BE
"O CANADA", ALL RIGHT?

82
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:30,910
(Applause and cheering)

83
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,012
THAT'S WONDERFUL,
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

84
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,683
I THOUGHT I MIGHT MENTION
AT THIS PARTICULAR JUNCTURE

85
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:40,920
THAT AMERICAN T.V. STARS
GET $50,000 AN EPISODE.

86
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:44,657
ALL RIGHT, MY NEW TUNE IS
"I'M A YANKEE DOODLE DANDY".

87
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,493
(Red): IN HONOUR
OF MOVING TO THE NETWORKS,

88
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,696
WE'RE ADDING VIOLENCE
TO THE SHOW.

89
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,497
BILL'S GONNA DO SOME BOXING.

90
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,599
HE'S SPONSORED
BY THE NOTEL MOTEL.

91
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,868
HE TOOK THAT
AS A FREE SAMPLE THING.

92
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:58,304
WE'VE GOTTEN OURSELVES
INTO GOOD SHAPE,

93
00:03:58,371 --> 00:03:59,972
AND I THINK WE'RE READY.

94
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,843
NOT THAT I DO A LOT OF BOXING
BUT WE WORKED OURSELVES INTO...

95
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,879
WE HAVE PRETTY FIRM,
PRETTY HARD BODIES--

96
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:09,749
WE'RE TIRED NOW,
BUT YOU GET TO REST.

97
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,250
WHERE IS HE?

98
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:14,153
OH, CAREFUL, THERE --
EASY, EASY, EASY.

99
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,788
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

100
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,891
WE'LL BE BACK
WHEN BILL LEARNS THE ROPES.

101
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,360
THIS IS THE BIG ONE.

102
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:27,233
THE GRAND PRIZE IS STUFF WE
PICKED UP BESIDE THE HIGHWAY.

103
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,601
YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS

104
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,336
TO GET MY UNCLE TO SAY--

105
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,305
(Shrieking)

106
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:34,907
(Audience laughing)

107
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,909
W-W-WHAT...

108
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,911
(Clearing
throat)

109
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:42,982
(Whooping)

110
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,517
S-S-S-S-S....

111
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,185
(Laughing)

112
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:48,521
S-S-S-S-S...

113
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,523
(Whooping)

114
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,892
(Clearing
throat)

115
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,429
(Coughing)

116
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,098
SEX?

117
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:00,433
(Shrieking)

118
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:06,839
(Laughing and applause)

119
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,341
(Strums acoustic guitar)

120
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,777
WAS A GUY
NAMED GEORGIE O'BRIAN

121
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,512
WHOSE MONEY
WAS ALWAYS SPENT

122
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,480
HE TRIED TO BUY
WHATEVER HE COULD

123
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,549
AND WHATEVER HE COULDN'T,
HE'D RENT

124
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,152
THE POOR FOOL WENT BANKRUPT
SO MANY TIMES

125
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,387
HE WAS DOWN
TO HIS VERY LAST CHANCE

126
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,756
WHEN HE GOT HIRED ON
BY THE GOVERNMENT

127
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,459
AS AN ADVISOR TO
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

128
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,795
IF THIS NETWORK DEAL
COMES THROUGH,

129
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,897
I'LL DO A LOT OF TRAVELLING --

130
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,565
PROMOTIONAL TRIPS,
PERSONAL APPEARANCES,

131
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:35,835
AVOIDING RELATIVES,
THAT KIND OF THING.

132
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,336
I TELL YOU ONE THING.

133
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:40,006
I DON'T WANT TO BE CARRYING
40 SUITCASES,

134
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:43,342
SO I THOUGHT I'D TAKE THIS WEEK
IN "HANDYMAN CORNER"

135
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,846
TO SHOW YOU HOW THE HANDY
TRAVELLER PACKS A SUITCASE.

136
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,682
FIRST, YOU GOT
YOUR BAG OF TOILETRIES.

137
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,185
YOU GOT SHAMPOO AND SOAP
AND MOUTHWASH

138
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,853
AND DEODORANT AND FOOT POWDER.

139
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,354
WELL...

140
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,856
(Crash)

141
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,291
YOU DON'T NEED THAT.

142
00:05:58,357 --> 00:05:59,659
YOU'RE ON THE ROAD.

143
00:05:59,725 --> 00:06:02,295
PEOPLE EXPECT YOU
TO SMELL A BIT OFF.

144
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,397
ALL RIGHT, NOW, SHOES.

145
00:06:04,463 --> 00:06:07,233
SHOES ARE NICE
BUT THEY TAKE UP SPACE.

146
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,969
SO I SAY GET YOURSELF
SOME TIN SNIPS.

147
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,806
CUT THE SHOE WHERE THE UPPERS
ARE MEETING THE SOLE.

148
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,409
I DON'T KNOW
WHOSE SHOES THESE ARE,

149
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:18,778
BUT I'M SURE THEY'LL THANK ME.

150
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,914
AH... DONE!

151
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,884
JUST TAKE ONE PAIR OF SANDALS
WITH YOU,

152
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:28,654
AND EVERY DAY, YOU WEAR
A DIFFERENT PAIR OF SHOES

153
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,424
BY PUTTING THE UPPER HALF
OVER THE SANDAL.

154
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,527
YOU GOT YOUR FORMAL,
YOU GOT YOUR RUNNING SHOE,

155
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,262
YOU HAVE YOUR SEMI-CASUAL,

156
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:39,065
AND PROBABLY THE MOST POPULAR,
THE CASUAL.

157
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:42,735
IT ALLOWS YOU TO THROW
THE SOLES AND HEELS AWAY.

158
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,170
(Crash)

159
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,606
YOU CAN START PACKING
SHIRTS, PANTS,

160
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,774
JACKETS, WHATEVER,
AND REMEMBER,

161
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:52,845
ONE PAIR OF SOCKS AND UNDERWEAR
FOR EVERY WEEK YOU'RE AWAY.

162
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,949
I KNOW HOTELS HAVE TOWELS BUT
THEY DON'T SEEM TO DRY WELL,

163
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,851
SO I LIKE TO BRING MY OWN.

164
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,386
SAME THING WITH SHEETS.

165
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,588
I DON'T WANT TO SLEEP
ON SOMETHING

166
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,858
THAT 8,000 STRANGERS
HAVE SLEPT ON... OR WHATEVER.

167
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,394
I FEEL THE SAME
ABOUT HOTEL PILLOWS.

168
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,897
I DON'T LIKE 'EM
AS MUCH AS MY OWN.

169
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:14,367
DON'T KNOW WHETHER
IT'S THE SMELL OR THE FEEL...

170
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:16,802
OR... MAYBE THEY'RE JUST NOT

171
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,704
AS SANITARY AS THEY NEED TO BE.

172
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,073
SO I LIKE TO BRING MY OWN.

173
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,344
I CAN SAY THE SAME THING
ABOUT HOTEL MATTRESSES.

174
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,280
TOO FLAT, TOO SMOOTH.

175
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,382
I LIKE TO BRING MY OWN.

176
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:33,886
(Grunting)

177
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:38,057
BERNICE IS PROBABLY NOT
GONNA BE COMING WITH ME,

178
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,394
SO ACTUALLY, I ONLY NEED
HALF A MATTRESS.

179
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,396
(Starting chainsaw)

180
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,402
(Stopping chainsaw)

181
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,839
OK, BUT HOW DO WE GET
THE SUITCASE SHUT?

182
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,241
TECHNOLOGY.

183
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,744
A FEW C-CLAMPS, SOME OTHER
CLAMPS, AND A COME-ALONG...

184
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,246
WE'LL GET 'ER CLOSED.

185
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,282
IT WILL TAKE A WHILE
TO HORSE THIS BABY DOWN,

186
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,384
SO LET'S GET BACK TO THE SHOW.

187
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:10,256
STAY TUNED -- BUZZ IS WIRED
BUT HIS PLANE ISN'T.

188
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:17,563
LET'S RETURN TO THE MIRTH
AND MAYHEM

189
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,932
OF THOSE WACKY GUYS
UP AT POSSUM LODGE,

190
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,767
WITH MY UNCLE, YOUR HOST...

191
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:25,271
RED GREEN!

192
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,772
(Plays piano)

193
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,274
(Applause and cheering)

194
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,775
GET AWAY, GET AWAY!

195
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,277
GO ON, GET OUT OF HERE!

196
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,845
GO ON, BEAT IT!

197
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,382
HAROLD, WHAT THE HECK
IS THAT ABOUT?

198
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,284
IT'S NOT ME --
IT'S THE NETWORK.

199
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,219
IF WE WANT
AN AMERICAN AUDIENCE,

200
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:41,721
WE GOTTA KEEP THIS MOVING.

201
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,222
SOME PACE -- NEAT, EH?

202
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,257
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT STUFF.

203
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:48,427
YOU MADE ME FORGET
WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY.

204
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,229
RELAX -- WE GOT CUE CARDS.

205
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,731
CUE CARDS? SINCE WHEN?

206
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,233
SINCE NOW --
YOU JUST CAN'T BLAB.

207
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,236
IT'S GOTTA BE TIGHTLY SCRIPTED
AND NETWORK-APPROVED.

208
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,804
(Whispering): OK.

209
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:07,013
ALL RIGHT, "WHEN THE GODS ARE
IMPALING THEIR HOG WOOFERS..."

210
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:08,748
OH.

211
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:11,250
(Audience laughing)

212
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:15,621
"WHILE THE GAYS ARE INFORMING
THEIR HIP WAFERS..."

213
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,123
OH, NOW I GOT IT.

214
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,457
OH, YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

215
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:21,660
"WHILE THE GUYS ARE INFLATING
THEIR HIP-WADERS,

216
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:25,064
"LET'S HAVE A LITTLE VISIT
FROM OUR SPECIAL GUEST,

"TALK ABOUT LUXURY."

00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:33,172
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.

221
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,175
I GOT THE HIP-WADING CONTEST
GOING ON.

222
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,378
THE NETWORK FEELS
THE HIP-WADING CONTEST

223
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:40,880
ISN'T WHAT YOU'D CALL...

224
00:09:40,946 --> 00:09:42,648
WHAT?
ENTERTAINING, SO...

225
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:43,983
ARE YOU
KIDDING ME?

226
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,317
I GOT 20 GUYS

227
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:48,020
PACKING THEIR SHORTS
FULL OF DRY ICE.

228
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,991
IF THAT'S NOT ENTERTAINMENT,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

229
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,860
THE POLITE TERM
IS "QUIRKY".

230
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:01,333
GOT A SPECIAL FEATURE
WITH BUZZ THIS WEEK.

231
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,302
A HOBBY THING HE'S GOT GOING.

232
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:06,205
MODEL-AIRPLANE FLYING
IS SWEEPING THE NATION,

233
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,706
AND IS IT ANY WONDER?

234
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,443
EVEN IF YOUR LICENCE
IS UNDER SUSPENSION,

235
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:13,312
YOU CAN STILL ENJOY
THE THRILL OF AVIATION.

236
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,647
WHOA, LOOK AT THAT!

237
00:10:14,713 --> 00:10:17,583
HOW FAR CAN YOU GET
THESE THINGS TO GO?

238
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,485
IT'S IN THE INSTRUCTIONS.

239
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:20,820
I DIDN'T READ 'EM.

240
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:23,322
UM, WHOSE PLANE IS THIS?

241
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,192
THAT'S MINE, BUT
IT'S A LITTLE WUSSY FOR ME.

242
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:29,929
I RIPPED THE GUTS OUT AND
PUT IT IN MY PLANE, "BEAUTY".

243
00:10:29,995 --> 00:10:32,765
YOU'RE FLYING A PLANE
WITH RADIO CONTROLS?

244
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,100
(Laughing)

245
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,434
WHOO!

246
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,269
HERE SHE COMES!

247
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:38,771
WHOA, LOOK AT THAT!

248
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,272
"BEAUTY"!

249
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,274
MAN, LOOK AT THAT TURN.

250
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,276
FLIES BETTER WITHOUT YOU IN IT.

251
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:45,778
IT DOES -- MAN!

252
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,279
WO LOOK AT THAT.

253
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,782
FLYING STRAIGHT --
WATCH ME SAY "HI".

254
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,283
ISN'T THAT COOL?

255
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,285
HOW DO YOU SLOW HER
FOR LANDING?

256
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:54,787
I HAVE NO IDEA.

257
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,455
I DIDN'T READ THAT PART.

258
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:57,790
GIVE ME THAT A SECOND.

259
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,291
OH... OH, BUZZ.

260
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:00,793
UM...

261
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,797
"CONNECT SOLENOID 4-A
TO CHANNEL 5..."

262
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,298
BUZZ?

263
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,300
HOW'S THAT GONNA HELP ME?

264
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,635
YOU GOT A PROBLEM!

265
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,804
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO LAND.

266
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,305
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY!

267
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,807
(Crash)

268
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,308
OHHHH!

269
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,810
OHHHH!

270
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,979
COOL!

271
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:24,250
NOW, THEN, TUCK IT IN THERE
AND CLOSE 'ER UP...

272
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,718
AND THERE WE ARE.

273
00:11:25,784 --> 00:11:29,755
YOU CAN TAKE WHATEVER YOU WANT,
IF YOU KNOW HOW TO PACK.

274
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:35,261
ALL I GOTTA DO IS
GET THESE CLAMPS OFF OF HERE...

275
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,897
AND I GOT SO MUCH STUFF WITH ME

276
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:41,767
THAT WHEREVER I GO,
IT WILL BE JUST LIKE HOME.

277
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:45,271
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

278
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:48,274
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

279
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,776
SO LONG.

280
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,278
AHHH...

281
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:55,281
(Grunting)

282
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:58,651
I MAY HAVE PUT
TOO MUCH STUFF IN THERE.

283
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,786
I MAY HAVE TO RE-PACK...

284
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:04,490
UH-OH, I THINK
SHE'S GONNA BLOW!

285
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:20,372
YEAH, LOOKS JUST LIKE HOME.

286
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,208
MY MAMA ALWAYS SAID,

287
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:25,744
"BUZZ, LIFE IS LIKE
A BOX OF CHOCOLATES,

288
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,746
"SO PIG OUT!"

289
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,315
(Laughing)

290
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,254
WELL...

291
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,256
(Audience laughing)

292
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,758
THE INFLATED
HIP-WADER CONTEST HAS BEGUN.

293
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,760
FIVE GUYS ARE OUT
OF THE RUNNING.

294
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,262
(Rubber
snapping)

295
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:47,266
(Shrieking)

296
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,767
SIX GUYS.

297
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,070
SIX GUYS OUT OF THE RUNNING.

298
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:53,138
WHEN THOSE HIP-WADERS GO,

299
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:57,276
THAT RUBBER LEAVES A WELT
YOU CAN LIGHT MATCHES ON.

300
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,777
(Audience laughing)

301
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,479
HAROLD!

302
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:01,981
WHAT IS
WITH YOU?

303
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,882
WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

304
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,451
YOU'RE DRESSED FUNNY.

305
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,288
I'M TRYING TO LOOK NICE
FOR THE NETWORK.

306
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,856
THAT'S TOO
BAD, HAROLD.

307
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,292
THERE'S ONLY 40 GUYS
LEFT IN THE CONTEST.

308
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,793
(Rubber
snapping)

309
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,464
(Shrieking)

310
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:19,798
THIRTY-NINE.

311
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,967
(Audience laughing)

312
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,369
SOME HIP-WADERS ARE GARBAGE.

313
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:24,670
THERE'S ONE BRAND--

314
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,405
UNCLE RED, DON'T MENTION

315
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,207
WHICH BRAND-NAME
IS THE CHEAPEST.

316
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,743
YOU MIGHT OFFEND
A POTENTIAL NETWORK SPONSOR.

317
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:35,247
HAROLD, I DON'T THINK THAT MANY
HIP-WADER COMPANIES ADVERTISE

318
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,749
ON NETWORK TELEVISION.

319
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,484
BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY.

320
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,420
THE SAFER WE GET,
THE SORRIER WE SOUND.

321
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,757
UNCLE RED, THIS AMERICAN
NETWORK DEAL IS A BIG THING.

322
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,258
WHAT ABOUT MICHAEL J. FOX?

323
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,861
HE'S A CANADIAN
WHO MADE IT IN HOLLYWOOD,

324
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:52,431
AND SO IS JASON PRIESTLEY,
AND WHAT ABOUT KEANU REEVES?

325
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,533
I COULD BE
THE NEXT KEANU REEVES.

326
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,635
(Audience laughing)

327
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,871
WELL, WHAT ABOUT ME?

328
00:13:58,937 --> 00:14:00,372
OH, YOU, TOO.

329
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:01,974
YOU COULD BE... MARY PICKFORD.

330
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,776
(Laughing and applause)

331
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:06,412
MARY PICKFORD?

332
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,380
(Red): BACK AT THE BOXING RING,

333
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:09,782
HAROLD'S HELPING BILL.

334
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,550
OH, BOY.

335
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,219
HAROLD WAS HELPING BILL
GET HIS GLOVES ON

336
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,288
OVER AT THE BIG SQUARED CIRCLE.

337
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,756
OH!

338
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,725
THIS IS TAKING SOME TIME,

339
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:23,929
BUT I BROUGHT SOME WAY
OF FILLING IN THE PATIENT WAIT.

340
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,964
SO GETTING THE HELMET ON.

341
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:30,235
BOXING'S A LOT SAFER THAN
IT USED TO BE, BUT STILL...

342
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,237
STILL NOT TOTALLY SAFE.

343
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,740
AND, UH... THAT NINE WILL GO--

344
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,408
THAT NINE WILL GO ON THE--

345
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,544
YEAH, ON THE 10, ON THE 10.

346
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,878
OK, THAT'S GOOD.

347
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,880
AND NOW WITH THE SAFETY THING.

348
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:43,515
THEY GOT THE MOUTH GUARD

349
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:46,885
SO YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT
YOUR TEETH GETTING DAMAGED

350
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,755
OR DRIVEN DOWN YOUR THROAT
OR UP YOUR NOSE.

351
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:53,258
YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT
BRUISED GUMS, IN BILL'S CASE.

352
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,760
ALL RIGHT WITH THAT?

353
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,261
HAROLD, JUST GET--

354
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:57,763
OOH, YUCK.

355
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,765
HAROLD, GET RID OF THOSE--

356
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,767
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

357
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,402
NICE TEETH.

358
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,838
JUST HANG ON A MINUTE.

359
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:08,173
YOU THINK OF THE TRADITION
OF BOXING,

360
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,542
THERE'S A LOT OF DIGNITY
TO THE SPORT,

361
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,778
AND A LOT OF POMP
AND CIRCUMSTANCE.

362
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,413
YOU THINK OF THE GREATS --

363
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,582
THE MUHAMMAD ALIS,
THE JOE LOUIS's,

364
00:15:16,648 --> 00:15:17,983
AND YOU'RE JUST PROUD.

365
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,386
YOU'RE PROUD TO BE
A PART OF THIS SPORT

366
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:24,089
THAT HAS BROUGHT SO MUCH HONOUR
TO A GREAT MANY ATHLETIC PEOPLE

367
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,624
AND THERE'S SOMETHING

368
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,826
ALMOST SPIRITUAL ABOUT IT,
YOU KNOW?

369
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:29,728
IT'S BORING, THOUGH, AT TIMES.

370
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:33,098
BUT YOU STAY TUNED, 'CAUSE
THE MAIN BOUT IS COMING UP.

371
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:37,136
WE GOT A SURPRISE, AND,
OBVIOUSLY, A DISAPPOINTMENT.

372
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,611
(Audience laughing)

373
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:47,112
(Applause)

374
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,581
YEAH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

375
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,083
(Cheering)

376
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,085
(Applause)

377
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,120
(Whistling)

378
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,890
THE POSSUM LODGE
INFLATED HIP-WADER CONTEST

379
00:15:57,956 --> 00:16:01,126
IS INTO THE HOME STRETCH,
AND I DO MEAN "STRETCH".

380
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,629
WE'RE DOWN TO FOUR GUYS.

381
00:16:03,695 --> 00:16:05,297
EXCUSE ME -- "PEOPLE".

382
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,799
FINAL FOUR PEOPLE.

383
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:10,269
THE NETWORK FEELS THAT
REFERRING TO GUYS AS GUYS

384
00:16:10,335 --> 00:16:12,070
IS A LITTLE BIT SEXIST.

385
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,705
THEY ARE GUYS, HAROLD.

386
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,707
CAN'T YOU CALL THEM PEOPLE?

387
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,576
NOT WITH A STRAIGHT FACE.

388
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,812
WE DON'T WANT TO OFFEND
THE WOMEN.

389
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:22,181
WE DON'T WANT THEM
TO FEEL EXCLUDED.

390
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,082
MAYBE JUST NOT BE SO SEXIST.

391
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,984
HAROLD, NOBODY'S EXCLUDED HERE.

392
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,486
POSSUM LODGE IS OPEN

393
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:30,155
TO ALL RACES, COLOURS,
CREEDS, AND SEXES.

394
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:33,492
WOMEN DON'T ENJOY THINGS
LIKE INFLATING HIP-WADERS.

395
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,595
IT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS,
SO WHAT WE GET IS GUYS.

396
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,564
SEE, THAT IS SEXIST.

397
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,233
NO, THAT IS REALITY.

398
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,603
OK, WELL, NETWORK TELEVISION
ISNOT REALITY.

399
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,271
IS IT, AUNT BERNICE?

400
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,706
WHAT?

401
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,608
(Swinging jazz music)

402
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,443
(Audience): WHOOOO!

403
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,111
(Whistling)

404
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,614
(Applause and cheering)

405
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,150
STAY TUNED
TO "THE RED GREEN SHOW"

406
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,618
FOR MORE GREAT FUN.

407
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,620
WHO ARE YOU?

408
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,121
I'M BERNICE.

409
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,556
THAT'S MY
WIFE'S NAME.

410
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:05,924
HAROLD?

411
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,026
SHE'S BERNICE?

412
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,562
YES.

413
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:14,566
I AM, AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE
LOTS OF ZANY ADVENTURES,

414
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,068
AREN'T WE, DEAR?

415
00:17:16,134 --> 00:17:19,338
WELL, IF YOU CAN CLEAR IT
WITH MY REAL WIFE,

416
00:17:19,404 --> 00:17:21,573
I'M WILLING TO GIVE IT A TRY.

417
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,077
(Applause and cheering)

418
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:28,747
(Red): WE FINALLY GOT
THIS BOXING MATCH UNDER WAY.

419
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:32,084
I'VE A LITTLE DIFFERENT
TECHNIQUE THAN BILL HAS.

420
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,586
HE'S MORE INTO
THE BOB AND WEAVE

421
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,955
AND BOB AND WEAVE AND BOB-BOB,

422
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,490
BOB-BOB AND WEAVE-WEAVE.

423
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,958
I JUST KIND OF...

424
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:42,027
HE TELEGRAPHS
HIS PUNCHES, BILL.

425
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,595
HE CAN MAIL 'EM TO YOU,

426
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,097
THEY GET THERE SO SLOW.

427
00:17:45,163 --> 00:17:46,598
WHAT IS THIS, BILL?

428
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,100
OH, HEY, WAIT!

429
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,501
HEY, HEY, TIME OUT!

430
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,103
TIME OUT, TIME OUT...

431
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:52,604
EXCEPT FOR YOU.

432
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,306
I'M KIDDING, I'M KIDDING.

433
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,108
I FIGURE, LET'S GET HAROLD--

434
00:17:56,174 --> 00:17:57,609
HAROLD, YOU'LL BE FINE.

435
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,111
HAROLD WILL FIGHT BILL.

436
00:17:59,177 --> 00:18:01,179
NO GLASSES -- THAT'S DANGEROUS.

437
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,315
YOU NEVER HIT A GUY
WITH GLASSES,

438
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,050
AND I WANT BILL TO GET HIT.

439
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,785
I PUT THEM OVER THERE.

440
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,554
OK, AWAY YOU GO, BOYS.

441
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,055
OH, HAROLD, COME ON.

442
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,557
OH, YOU BIG WUSS.

443
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,025
WHAT I'M REALIZING IS

444
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:15,661
BILL REALLY DOES HAVE
A VISION PROBLEM.

445
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,429
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, BILL?

446
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,464
THAT'S NOT-- OH, I SEE.

447
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,466
NO, THAT'S NOT HAROLD.

448
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,569
IT'S JUST A PAIL,
FOR GOSH SAKES!

449
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,237
OH, MY!

450
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,740
YEAH, YEAH,
HE'S THE BIG WINNER.

451
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,208
YOU'RE THE BIG WINNER.

452
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,578
EVER HAD A KNOCK-OUT BEFORE?

453
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,413
THERE'S ONE.

454
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:36,348
WAY TO GO, HAROLD!

455
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,684
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT PORTION.

456
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,554
ON THIS WEEK'S EXPERT PORTION,
WE HAVE MY UNCLE RED

457
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,924
AND WATER-TAXI CAPTAIN,
MR. HAP SHAUGHNESSY!

458
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,594
(Applause and cheering)

459
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,662
(Whistling)

460
00:18:52,864 --> 00:18:55,434
THIS WEEK'S LETTER
GOES AS FOLLOWS:

461
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,102
(Singing) BA-DUM-BUM-BUM

462
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,437
"DEAR EXPERTS, WHAT IS

463
00:18:58,503 --> 00:19:00,606
"THE GREATEST
ROCK 'N' ROLL BAND EVER?"

464
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,874
EASY -- R.E.M. -- AHHH!

465
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,610
(Audience laughing)

466
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:06,111
NO, NO, NO, HAROLD,

467
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:09,448
THE GREATEST BAND EVER,
CANADIAN BAND, THE GUESS WHO.

468
00:19:09,514 --> 00:19:11,516
I DON'T KNOW -- WHO?

469
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,985
(Audience laughing)

470
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:16,855
WELL, PERSONALLY, I'D HAVE
PICKED THE ROLLING STONES,

471
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,958
BUT SINCE I WAS ONCE
PART OF THEIR BAND...

472
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:23,128
(Laughing)

473
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:27,366
I GUESS... I GUESS
THE STONES SHOULDN'T COUNT.

474
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,168
DID YOU CHAUFFEUR THEM AROUND
ONCE OR...

475
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:34,139
NO, NO, PLAYED LEAD GUITAR
FOR A FEW MONTHS.

476
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:38,377
WHEN KEITH RICHARDS WAS TOO ILL,
YOU KNOW, WITH HIS...

477
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,446
DIDN'T THE AGE DIFFERENCE

478
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,649
GET IN THE WAY,
MR. SHAUGHNESSY?

479
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,651
THEY WEREN'T MUCH
OLDER THAN ME.

480
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:48,186
OH.

481
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:50,689
WHEN KEITH WOULD GO
UP TO HIS ROOM,

482
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:53,258
I'D HAVE TO TAKE CARE
OF THOSE WOMEN

483
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,994
WHO WANTED TO MEET HIM --
THE "GROPIES".

484
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,663
(Audience laughing)

485
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:01,066
IT WAS A GOOD JOB, THOUGH --
350 BUCKS A NIGHT.

486
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,935
I WOULD HAVE PAID THEM
TWICE THAT MUCH.

487
00:20:06,304 --> 00:20:07,739
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.

488
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:09,241
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE?

489
00:20:09,307 --> 00:20:11,343
FOR GOSH SAKES -- A GUITAR!

490
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,412
THERE
YOU GO, HAP.

491
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:16,248
PLAY US A LITTLE
ROLLING STONES MUSIC.

492
00:20:16,314 --> 00:20:20,519
ARE YOU TRYING TO EMBARRASS ME
IN FRONT OF MY FANS, RED?

493
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:23,622
JUST TRYING TO GET
A LITTLE SATISFACTION.

494
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,524
(Audience laughing)

495
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,127
(Whistling)

496
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:32,631
(Applause and cheering)

497
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:36,635
(Whistling)

498
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,137
(Whooping)

499
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:43,041
WE HAVE A WINNER IN
THE INFLATED HIP-WADER CONTEST,

500
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:45,077
AND OBVIOUSLY IT ISN'T ME.

501
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:49,181
I GOT 'ER UP TO FULL PRESSURE
AND SAT ON MY CAR KEYS.

502
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:51,783
NOW ALL I GOT
IS THIS RUBBER KILT.

503
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,920
(Laughing)

504
00:20:54,986 --> 00:20:58,123
(Audience laughing)

505
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,659
THAT'S GREAT, UNCLE RED.

506
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:04,830
SO, WHAT DID WE LEARN
FROM THIS WEEK'S EPISODE?

507
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,099
WHO THE HECK ARE YOU?

508
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:08,734
(Laughing)

509
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,635
I'M HAROLD.

510
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,671
YOUR NEPHEW?

511
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:16,141
YOUR NETWORK-APPROVED NEPHEW.

512
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,943
OH, WELL,
GOLLY.

513
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:20,178
MAYBE THIS IS WORKING OUT
AFTER ALL.

514
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,247
ALL RIGHT,
HERE'S WHAT I LEARNED.

515
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,750
NEVER HOLD AN INFLATED
HIP-WADER CONTEST

516
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,618
NEXT TO A GAME OF LAWN DARTS.

517
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:32,124
(Laughing)

518
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,827
AND I'VE LEARNED THAT
IF YOU TELL A LIE,

519
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:39,364
THE ONLY PERSON YOU HURT
IS YOURSELF.

520
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,141
AND YOU KNOW?

521
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:52,144
UNCLE RED, IT'S THE WORST KIND
OF HURT.

522
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,646
OH, NO, IT ISN'T.

523
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,114
CUT!

524
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:57,649
CUT! WHOA! CUT!

525
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,451
THAT'S NOT WORKING, UNCLE RED.

526
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,620
I'M NOT MAKING ANY MORE CHANGES.

527
00:22:01,686 --> 00:22:03,021
THERE WON'T BE CHANGES.

528
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,257
THE NETWORK ISN'T INTERESTED
ANY MORE.

529
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:06,591
WHY NOT?

530
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,360
THEY FINALLY WATCHED
AN EPISODE.

531
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,096
I'M GONE.

532
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,597
I'M HISTORY,
TOO.

533
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,099
COME ON.

534
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:18,103
OK, UNCLE RED, MAYBE YOU
DON'T GET A NETWORK TIME SLOT,

535
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,604
BUT YOU GET ME BACK.

536
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,107
A GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS THING?

537
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,609
ONE BEING GOOD NEWS
AND ONE BEING BAD NEWS?

538
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,111
THAT'S HOW I SEE IT.

539
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,612
(Possum squeal)

540
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,114
MEETING TIME.

541
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,082
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

542
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:32,417
WHAT A DAY.

543
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:33,985
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

544
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:36,855
I'M COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

545
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,824
THAT WIFE THE NETWORK GAVE ME

546
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:42,160
WASN'T HALF THE WOMAN YOU ARE,
IN AGE OR WEIGHT...

547
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,129
OR SENSE OF HUMOUR --
RIGHT, BERNICE?

548
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,463
LAUGH IT UP.

549
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,933
THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

550
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:51,736
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND HAROLD
AND THE NON-NETWORK GANG,

551
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,638
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

552
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:58,643
(Applause and cheering)

553
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,712
(Possum squeal)

554
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:07,152
ALL RISE, ALL RISE!

555
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,090
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.
