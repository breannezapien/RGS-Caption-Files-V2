1
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:43,910
Ever since man is first walked upright
billions of years ago, he has been a hunter,

2
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,146
a fisherman, and he's lived off the land.

3
00:00:46,412 --> 00:00:50,049
Ok, all right. Well, now billions of years
ago, because, you know, dinosaurs only went

4
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,886
extinct about, you know, like, maybe about
sixty five million years ago.

5
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,120
And oh yeah, OK.

6
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:57,857
Sometimes, though, science fiction movies,
you see, like a Tyrannosaurus rex being some

7
00:00:57,857 --> 00:00:59,559
cave guy that couldn't happen.

8
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:03,129
There's no way because like humanoids,
they've only been around like for like, I

9
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:04,564
don't know, maybe a few million years.

10
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:07,634
Whereas in real people, I've only been
around like maybe a couple of hundred

11
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:14,007
thousand, OK. But by real people, what I
mean is, like Homo erectus thought, OK, you

12
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,676
know you're laughing, but don't. Even
because this is this is a real term.

13
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:20,914
These are the people who existed between
like Neanderthals and like The Flintstones,

14
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,548
right in there. That's special time.

15
00:01:22,548 --> 00:01:27,186
And they're the ones they develop off by the
fill ops and the Flint Knife.

16
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,721
And these are real bones in the air.

17
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:32,592
Like that movie two thousand and one and see
that did not understand that movie

18
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,194
whatsoever. I'll tell you that it had like a
black cartridge or something.

19
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,030
It's like a Nintendo game cartridge.

20
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,731
I had no idea. Harold, I'm sorry.

21
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,734
Here he is, the star of the red green show
Red Green.

22
00:01:44,203 --> 00:01:48,307
Awesome possum watch overstaying his welcome
is Harold.

23
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:53,980
Harold is my producer and director and due
to an unfortunate family situation, he's also

24
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,818
my nephew. Harold has eaten most of our time
with a stream of unconsciousness there.

25
00:01:58,851 --> 00:01:59,786
I'm sorry, uncle rat.

26
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:01,988
Sometimes you just get ideas and I can't stop
it.

27
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:03,389
Here comes an idea right now. Here comes.

28
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,294
Oh, with that cool and or hip or what?

29
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:11,330
Oh, that's eaten up even a little more time.

30
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,367
So I'm going to I'm going to have to keep
things moving him very quickly, and I'm

31
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,768
running out of time, very little time left.

32
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,237
I've got Ernie, you know, I sound exactly
like Christine.

33
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:19,806
Like, it was good.

34
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:20,873
Wasn't he one of the better ones?

35
00:02:20,873 --> 00:02:22,308
I thought he was really something else.

36
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,777
He was so true. David Copperfield, he was
good, too.

37
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,345
He made a Statue of Liberty disappear.

38
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,713
Oh, where are you going to put that your
closet?

39
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:29,916
I don't even think so. I'm sorry, uncle red.

40
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,517
You go right ahead. What you're doing?

41
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,621
Thank you, Harold. Three seconds I have left.

42
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:38,991
I thought I would mention that the lodge has
gone for a new life insurance policy.

43
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:40,026
That you should tell that story.

44
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,427
That's a really good story to tell because

45
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:44,897
You know, a better. So we all had to have
examinations.

46
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:48,367
But the problem was that Glen Braxton
flunked his exam.

47
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:49,602
I mean, his physical was so bad.

48
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:53,639
I think his cholesterol was five thousand
over something, and they ended up taking away

49
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:56,676
his driver's license, which means he can't
drive his beloved RV.

50
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:59,845
I'll tell you, Glenn is not a happy camper.

51
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:01,380
In fact, he's not a camper at all.

52
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,015
Sixteen thousand one.

53
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:03,549
What was that?

54
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,151
Whose house do the next segment once you?

55
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:05,918
Ok.

56
00:03:13,492 --> 00:03:16,696
I think that's the whole deal.

57
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,966
My stakes. Yeah.

58
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:20,933
Just ask your feet.

59
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:25,838
Oh, I say you should be up on your feet, you
know, moving around, get your circulation

60
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:26,205
going.

61
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,975
Well, doctor just gave me a death sentence,
Harold.

62
00:03:30,142 --> 00:03:32,211
What it is, you know, a death sentence.

63
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:36,549
You might as well pull out a shotgun, put up
beside my head and blown it off.

64
00:03:37,316 --> 00:03:38,884
I don't think general practitioners can do
that.

65
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,621
She only said that you're out of shape.

66
00:03:42,621 --> 00:03:44,123
Shouldn't say you're going to die, Glenn.

67
00:03:44,156 --> 00:03:46,359
She said, I couldn't drive my RV anymore.

68
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,594
I mean, it's it's worse than dying.

69
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:51,831
I mean, what else do I have in my life?

70
00:03:52,164 --> 00:03:54,166
I own and operate the only marina for 20
miles.

71
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:56,769
Yeah, but some of my like.

72
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:04,243
Bill, have you seen Glen Braxton?

73
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:08,681
Oh, hey. Gleno, huh?

74
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,250
Up and at. Let's go at it.

75
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,721
Drop dead and all, I'm about to shape up,
man.

76
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,623
We're going to get you back in the driver's
seat.

77
00:04:18,457 --> 00:04:27,099
Look at I brought. Oh, I've heard about
these diets.

78
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,335
I'd rather stick your fingers down my
throat.

79
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:33,672
This happens to be a simple, portable muscle
machine.

80
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:37,309
Let me demonstrate. Whoa.

81
00:04:37,743 --> 00:04:38,944
Whoa, whoa.

82
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,150
So what? I got to smack myself with a hose
to get in shape.

83
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,919
No, no, no, no.

84
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:53,559
That was an accident. But but I can
guarantee that in two weeks you can have a

85
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:57,029
body like mine. Oh, great, he's going to
soft my legs.

86
00:04:58,297 --> 00:04:59,598
Ok, fine. Thank you very much.

87
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:03,869
I'll have, you know, Mr. I'm in terrific
shape, Harold.

88
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:06,372
Sir, come on over. You try to hurt me.

89
00:05:06,605 --> 00:05:07,239
Oh no,

90
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:08,307
No, no, no, no.

91
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,777
And all I know this one. This is where you
tear up my heart and show it to me just

92
00:05:11,777 --> 00:05:12,878
before I die.

93
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:15,114
I think enough girls have done that to me in
my lifetime already.

94
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:15,948
Thanks very much.

95
00:05:16,248 --> 00:05:20,419
It's my last sprint, but that hurt me.

96
00:05:21,286 --> 00:05:22,788
All right. You're short and you can't get a
date.

97
00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:25,891
I meant physically. No thanks.

98
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:26,625
I'm going to drink.

99
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:29,561
Bill, Gary, come on.

100
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,563
Try to hurt me. Huh? Come on.

101
00:05:36,368 --> 00:05:38,037
I met with your heads. Wow.

102
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:41,940
Yes. I wasn't ready if you were going to get
mugged.

103
00:05:42,441 --> 00:05:43,942
They'd have the phone ahead and make a
reservation.

104
00:05:46,378 --> 00:05:47,946
Who'd like a better time?

105
00:05:53,118 --> 00:05:55,287
Starboard. Oh, yeah, sure.

106
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,957
Whoa. Are you crazy?

107
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,693
Half my politics are stuck to the ceiling.

108
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:04,830
This man does not need a buttercup.

109
00:06:06,331 --> 00:06:08,867
You might as well have taken one of those
things and jab it right into his heart.

110
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:12,237
I'd like to take one of those things and jam
it down your throat.

111
00:06:12,437 --> 00:06:14,840
Those took me two hours and nine pounds of
flour.

112
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,476
I thought you said they were Stortford.

113
00:06:17,843 --> 00:06:19,678
Well, you wouldn't notice the difference.

114
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,615
You know, Glenn has given up junk food.

115
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:24,917
Whoa. Whoa, no.

116
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:30,756
Since when since you decided to lose 20
pounds in shape up your pathetic blubber

117
00:06:30,756 --> 00:06:32,958
butt? Oh, good.

118
00:06:33,091 --> 00:06:40,499
Well, let me look, you got a buddy like a
sack of tapioca.

119
00:06:43,835 --> 00:06:46,138
You've you talking to me?

120
00:06:46,171 --> 00:06:49,041
Yes, you. The government asks you to list
your first three ingredients.

121
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:49,641
You'd have to list

122
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:51,076
Fat, fat, fat.

123
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:56,014
And what are you laughing at me?

124
00:06:56,848 --> 00:06:58,483
Yeah, I mean, you put out another five
pounds.

125
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,385
You'd have your own gravitational field.

126
00:07:02,888 --> 00:07:08,360
Have you laughing at I don't say who me that
those dreams out one more time, you can have

127
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,995
nine separate pieces of denim.

128
00:07:11,596 --> 00:07:12,864
Ok. Ok.

129
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:15,834
All right. I think we've established that
you're all a little overweight.

130
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,937
So can we get started now?

131
00:07:19,938 --> 00:07:21,406
Assume this position?

132
00:07:22,507 --> 00:07:24,343
Well, let's just assume I assumed it.

133
00:07:24,943 --> 00:07:26,278
And don't get the floor, you guys.

134
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:32,184
Oh, fine. How are we not going to turn our
bodies into lethal weapons?

135
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:44,162
At night, you'll see the men sitting on the
porch, chewing and spitting in the light of

136
00:07:44,162 --> 00:07:45,197
the propane cart.

137
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:54,206
That you and I spent till the morning light
in the future when they eat muskrat, they'll

138
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:56,007
remember to marinate it first.

139
00:08:00,712 --> 00:08:01,012
Both.

140
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:09,921
This week in the corner

141
00:08:09,988 --> 00:08:13,925
And I show you something festive and
decorative that you can do to your patio, you

142
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:17,596
know, the patio up here at the Lodge has not
been looking all that great since we did that

143
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:20,765
experiment to find out whether or not
hydrogen is flammable.

144
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:24,970
But, you know, I think we can bring her
right back up to snuff here by making our

145
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,638
very own patio lanterns.

146
00:08:26,638 --> 00:08:29,474
And they're real easy to make and kind of
fun for.

147
00:08:29,474 --> 00:08:32,344
For starters, you have your Christmas
lights, which are probably hanging up at your

148
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:33,712
house all summer long anyhow.

149
00:08:33,745 --> 00:08:35,780
So why not just double up with those?

150
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:40,085
All you need is some of those plastic
containers you might find two or three in the

151
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:50,228
in the garbage. I just picked these out of
today's garbage up here at

152
00:08:50,228 --> 00:08:53,298
the Lodge and there are a little dirty.

153
00:08:53,598 --> 00:08:56,835
I would suggest you just let that long just
kind of dry on there and then pick it off

154
00:08:56,835 --> 00:09:00,872
with your thumbnail. I tried to clean one of
them, not in the dishwasher.

155
00:09:00,872 --> 00:09:04,943
You know, there's a heater unit in those
dishwashers, and that thing just shriveled up

156
00:09:04,943 --> 00:09:08,113
there like a. Well, you guys know what I'm
talking about anyway.

157
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,685
What you want to do is pick out one of the
containers that seems appropriate size and

158
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:18,023
shape to make a patio out of something like
that, for example.

159
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:20,158
And then you want to see, well, let's see
which way we hang that.

160
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:23,895
Well, I think kind of that kind of looks
kind of like a big plastic teat on there.

161
00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:26,631
I the sun porch door.

162
00:09:26,631 --> 00:09:31,403
They're having a good then that you want to
do is you want to cut up an X in the bottom.

163
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,037
You can use a carpet knife for them.

164
00:09:33,037 --> 00:09:34,038
I have a carpet knife in my pocket.

165
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,878
All right, someone didn't put the blade away
before they put that in my pocket.

166
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:47,418
Now what you want to do here is you want to
cut an axe and cut it about two inches or if

167
00:09:47,418 --> 00:09:52,023
you're if you're dealing in centimeters, you
want to cut enough centimeters that it's two

168
00:09:52,023 --> 00:10:01,366
inches. Ok, OK, OK.

169
00:10:01,366 --> 00:10:04,502
Now we've got our X and then you just put
the bulb right in there and it's kind of a

170
00:10:04,502 --> 00:10:07,572
friction fit and that's that's really on
there.

171
00:10:07,805 --> 00:10:09,107
That really doesn't excite.

172
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:16,948
All right. You just you just do that for all
of them.

173
00:10:17,615 --> 00:10:21,052
The cutting thing, not the slapping yourself
in the face thing.

174
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:23,454
I'm not sure if you want to slap yourself in
the face.

175
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:25,089
I'm not. I would help you.

176
00:10:26,891 --> 00:10:28,092
By golly, that's Mars.

177
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:36,467
All right, that's two. It's taking no longer
than I thought.

178
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:44,709
Well, oh.

179
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:58,423
All right. There is a there's actually an
easier way than a carpet killer punch the

180
00:10:58,423 --> 00:11:00,825
holes in these things. This would be with
the with a power tool.

181
00:11:01,859 --> 00:11:03,161
Let's see if this works a little better.

182
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:11,102
I think so, we'll get the old bleach bottle
here.

183
00:11:14,505 --> 00:11:18,476
Oh, I saw that one out.

184
00:11:19,377 --> 00:11:24,048
Another thing you do with a power tool is
you can kind of save a little bit of time.

185
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:39,197
All right. Well, we'll start to get a few
more going here, and the next step will be to

186
00:11:39,764 --> 00:11:43,367
take our containers and stick the Christmas
lights through those.

187
00:11:45,536 --> 00:11:47,071
I got a hammer, just tap those on.

188
00:11:49,106 --> 00:11:52,443
By the time I finish getting everything
rigged, I think it's going to be dark enough

189
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:53,744
to show you how this really looks.

190
00:11:56,347 --> 00:11:59,250
Now you tell me who wouldn't want to have
that hanging around their house, huh?

191
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:01,519
Harold, kill the lights there a minute.

192
00:12:02,453 --> 00:12:04,522
Hey, look at that.

193
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:06,624
Good friend. Good fun.

194
00:12:06,624 --> 00:12:08,659
Good food and margarine tubs.

195
00:12:09,694 --> 00:12:14,198
You know, I think this is the greatest
recycling decorators idea since cutting tires

196
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:16,634
in half, painting them white and putting up
the side of your driveway.

197
00:12:17,668 --> 00:12:22,640
Now, until next time, remember if the women
don't find it handsome, they should at least

198
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,612
find it handy. I can't find anything,
Harold, that's

199
00:12:27,612 --> 00:12:28,613
Got the lights back on, will you?

200
00:12:29,547 --> 00:12:35,620
Oh. Thank you, Harold.

201
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:40,191
Hello. Maybe it's right, Bill.

202
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,226
Maybe I should work or something.

203
00:12:42,593 --> 00:12:44,962
Get up. I should watch what I eat.

204
00:12:51,302 --> 00:12:54,238
Are you going eat that one? Yeah.

205
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:14,258
It is summer, two men are arm wrestling
locked in a drawer for 15 minutes with their

206
00:13:14,258 --> 00:13:18,129
huge ham like fists wrapped around the last
beer in the house.

207
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:29,306
Now, the final insurance policy arrived, and
I got to go around and get everybody's

208
00:13:29,306 --> 00:13:32,543
signature. Let's hope nobody dies before
they get the sign.

209
00:13:32,576 --> 00:13:33,410
That'd be a real tragedy.

210
00:13:34,311 --> 00:13:36,113
I have to sign on the dotted line too.

211
00:13:36,113 --> 00:13:39,550
I know I'm not like a lodge member, but you
know, I consider myself a keen observer

212
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:40,584
driving asylum.

213
00:13:40,584 --> 00:13:41,318
Observer Herald.

214
00:13:41,418 --> 00:13:42,186
Oh yeah, right?

215
00:13:44,588 --> 00:13:47,691
Glen's going around here feeling sorry for
himself, which isn't that hard to do.

216
00:13:48,292 --> 00:13:51,896
I'll tell you if moping burns calories,
Glenn is going to drop about 40 pounds by

217
00:13:51,896 --> 00:13:54,331
dinner. No one's trying to get him into
shape.

218
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:58,435
When Glenn is not looking and wiggles out
and moves the RV about 40 feet down the

219
00:13:58,435 --> 00:14:02,773
laneway, something gets a little more
exercise, and Noel also turn the broom closet

220
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:05,910
into a sauna. Right now, there's eight guys
in there sweating it out.

221
00:14:06,877 --> 00:14:08,279
Oh yeah, what are they using for heat?

222
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:11,181
Hey, guys! Ooh, yeah.

223
00:14:11,515 --> 00:14:15,519
Glenn is drinking beer out of a heavier mug
now and kind of build up the biceps, and he

224
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,554
licks the salt off the pretzels before he
eats them.

225
00:14:17,688 --> 00:14:18,055
Wow.

226
00:14:18,088 --> 00:14:19,290
Next, stop the Olympics.

227
00:14:20,524 --> 00:14:24,261
Yeah, I think the problem is, you know, you
are what you eat, and Eddie keeps pumping us

228
00:14:24,261 --> 00:14:28,799
full of pancakes and doughnuts and French
toast and muffins, and he deep fries all that

229
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:30,634
stuff. Hurry up, Uncle Red, I'm getting
hungry.

230
00:14:31,068 --> 00:14:35,839
Yeah, me too. Eddie, are you making for
lunch today?

231
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,908
What do you see here, right?

232
00:14:38,642 --> 00:14:40,311
Four heart attacks, three strokes and a
hernia.

233
00:14:41,845 --> 00:14:46,216
Don't you blame me? Because Glenn's a three
hundred pound weakling who made the high

234
00:14:46,216 --> 00:14:50,754
fiber ice cream, who made the broccoli
cheesecake, who made the artichoke yogurt

235
00:14:50,754 --> 00:14:51,288
surprise.

236
00:14:52,656 --> 00:14:55,159
Get it out on purpose yesterday.

237
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:58,896
Yesterday I made garlic and onion doughnuts.

238
00:14:59,897 --> 00:15:01,398
Well, obviously threats don't work with these
guys.

239
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,969
Do you know, Ed? I think you should cut down
on the salt and the cholesterol?

240
00:15:05,969 --> 00:15:07,438
Take some of the grease off the salads.

241
00:15:08,505 --> 00:15:10,641
I'm not Glenn's mother, you know?

242
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:12,476
No, I know. I know.

243
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:14,578
Mind you, there is a strong resemblance.

244
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,181
Yeah. Well, something's got to be done,
that's for sure.

245
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,650
Give me another whack of that on here, would
you, ed?

246
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:20,918
Sure. There you go.

247
00:15:21,251 --> 00:15:24,655
Oh, wait, no beauty.

248
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:30,394
Well, this week on adventures was Bill,

249
00:15:31,128 --> 00:15:38,635
I guess this means we're going to go canoeing
up there somewhere and she goes and well,

250
00:15:38,735 --> 00:15:41,371
bill. Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.

251
00:15:43,874 --> 00:15:45,609
Yeah. Yeah, it's adventure would be right.

252
00:15:45,642 --> 00:15:48,679
All right. He's fine. Ok, now I thought we
just go paddling with Bill said.

253
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:50,347
No, I want to use a paddles.

254
00:15:50,948 --> 00:15:52,349
Hey, sorry about that.

255
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:58,655
So he wanted to show us some different ways
of powering a canoe here, rather than the

256
00:15:58,655 --> 00:16:03,660
normal conventional use of a paddle, so he's
got a real nice, nice little headboard.

257
00:16:04,027 --> 00:16:09,700
But I wasn't exactly sure how he is going to
attach it on, and I want to say I was going

258
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,335
to swing it out to him. It's kind of heavy.

259
00:16:11,335 --> 00:16:12,736
It's I want to get and I was on.

260
00:16:13,136 --> 00:16:18,208
It was unfortunate, but no problem.

261
00:16:18,308 --> 00:16:20,210
Yeah, lots more. I do that one come from.

262
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:22,446
And now this one might.

263
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:26,049
This one might be a little bigger than what
the canoe is rated for, but we don't have to

264
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,884
turner on fuller of.

265
00:16:28,452 --> 00:16:31,488
I hadn't realized the weight I have now.

266
00:16:31,488 --> 00:16:34,424
I don't know if bolting that onto the side
is to me.

267
00:16:34,424 --> 00:16:35,826
It would go on the end, but then.

268
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:43,100
Expert Mike Bell. Anyway, so we kind of
abandoned that we were running short on the

269
00:16:43,266 --> 00:16:46,103
bars and we just got her up on the dock,
dump the water on her.

270
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:51,942
I wasn't quite sure what Bill Mitchell had
planned there, whether he wasn't even on the

271
00:16:51,942 --> 00:16:54,444
dock. And then you just what you do is you
tow the dock around.

272
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:59,950
No, he went me in. He come back with I went
up under under the lodge there and got all

273
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:07,491
the all the towels and we use spaghetti
night anyway.

274
00:17:07,524 --> 00:17:11,027
Yeah, 15, 16 bottles or saw there, I guess.

275
00:17:11,027 --> 00:17:13,497
And they didn't quite know what he had in
mind.

276
00:17:13,764 --> 00:17:20,770
And he broke down a bunch of sea clamps and
some rope there and a little bit of this and

277
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:27,177
that started hooking the paddles onto the
sides and up onto the gunnels and the sides

278
00:17:27,177 --> 00:17:28,612
and where the gun, all those meat sides,
even.

279
00:17:28,945 --> 00:17:32,616
And then I put the bow and down at that
other one.

280
00:17:32,649 --> 00:17:38,154
The other end the I guess, the assistant
bough or the back, I think is gone.

281
00:17:38,154 --> 00:17:42,192
And now when he created here was basically
the sailboat.

282
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:45,428
Heidi, I was there. Keel as your father
paddles on the side and there's your main

283
00:17:45,428 --> 00:17:49,432
mast and you're Mizan and your halyard and
your mainstay and your first day.

284
00:17:49,432 --> 00:17:52,269
And oh, that's OK, that's OK to say that.

285
00:17:52,802 --> 00:17:54,271
Now what he needed was some cloth to put on
anyone.

286
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:55,939
Take my shirt. I don't know.

287
00:17:56,072 --> 00:17:59,042
I'm not going to give you, take your own,
you hang your own clothes on anyway.

288
00:17:59,042 --> 00:18:00,710
So I pretended that I take mine off.

289
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:06,950
He took his off and you know, we didn't want
anybody to see this at home, so everybody had

290
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:12,555
fatter fingers. Anyway, Bill stripped right
down there and which was a real treat for the

291
00:18:12,555 --> 00:18:15,558
bugs, but it started attaching his clothing.

292
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:17,327
And what have you and God?

293
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:21,665
He loves these things and at All Ordinaries
got in those pants and I had to do.

294
00:18:21,698 --> 00:18:24,167
All I had to do was kind of look like a
Viking act.

295
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,302
I was like, I follow the Viking all.

296
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:34,277
Well, I figured maybe he could try the motor
again.

297
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:47,724
Well, just a few signatures to go and every
large member will be covered for death or

298
00:18:47,724 --> 00:18:52,095
dismemberment. You know that a hand is worth
more than a foot that surprised me.

299
00:18:52,295 --> 00:18:56,800
I mean, I can understand than I being worth
more than an ear, but I would think you'd

300
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,636
rather walk somewhere with one hand and hop
there with two.

301
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:03,840
And, you know, there's something kind of
warm about the guy asking me how to spell

302
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,276
their names, not to use the real names.

303
00:19:06,276 --> 00:19:07,944
There are no nicknames except for Nick.

304
00:19:08,778 --> 00:19:11,347
Hey, Harold, you know, Junior Singleton's
real name is Larry

305
00:19:11,648 --> 00:19:15,919
David or Doug Vladimir Vance.

306
00:19:15,952 --> 00:19:18,021
Valerie Pig knows Carol.

307
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:18,588
All right.

308
00:19:21,858 --> 00:19:22,559
That's Chris.

309
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,262
Hey, to Brutus, a two Popeye.

310
00:19:27,497 --> 00:19:29,465
An old man. His real name is old man.

311
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:31,701
I wonder he couldn't wait to grow up.

312
00:19:33,236 --> 00:19:34,837
Dickie Peterson His first name is actually
George.

313
00:19:36,372 --> 00:19:38,808
Actually, stinky looks like a George, but he
has the air of a stinky.

314
00:19:40,043 --> 00:19:41,678
Oh, I got the rest of the signatures at
tonight's meeting.

315
00:19:43,413 --> 00:19:46,583
Oh, that's the cry of the wild possum won't
go red.

316
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,585
It's time for the meeting. We better get
down there.

317
00:19:48,618 --> 00:19:51,054
We have to convince Glenn that his life
really is worth living.

318
00:19:51,187 --> 00:19:52,555
Well, maybe you can describe your life.

319
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:53,590
I don't make him feel better.

320
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:54,757
Yeah, OK.

321
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:59,228
You know, I think if the insurance company
was aware of Harold's personality, they might

322
00:19:59,228 --> 00:20:03,866
not give us a policy, you know, just get him
that way.

323
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:04,968
Right, right.

324
00:20:06,903 --> 00:20:16,546
Right? Oh, oh, oh, oh all nice.

325
00:20:18,948 --> 00:20:21,918
When you poke, Barb, don't take it

326
00:20:26,756 --> 00:20:30,760
From the Pakistan side at Stamford Bridge.

327
00:20:31,427 --> 00:20:31,928
All right.

328
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:34,430
Now I need your signature on this insurance
policy.

329
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:41,771
Message for me. Oh, all right, all right.

330
00:20:42,071 --> 00:20:43,773
The floor recognizes normal Christmas.

331
00:20:45,308 --> 00:20:50,680
Thank you, right? I'd just like to show you
what my athlete has learned in just one day

332
00:20:51,247 --> 00:20:52,615
going Glen Joe.

333
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:55,118
Well, I can show you how I can strangle
Noel.

334
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:05,761
He will go.

335
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:16,973
Well. It's a big day for me.

336
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:20,476
All on, guys, hold everything.

337
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:25,781
Dr. I mean, they've made a mistake on these
reports for the insurance investigation here.

338
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:27,817
It's not Glenn that that has the high
cholesterol.

339
00:21:29,252 --> 00:21:34,323
It's no. Me.

340
00:21:34,924 --> 00:21:39,762
Oh, yeah, and you got high blood pressure to
know who says, Glenn, you're fine.

341
00:21:40,563 --> 00:21:41,831
I can run the army again.

342
00:21:41,864 --> 00:21:48,437
Yes, you can, sir. They say you're so relaxed
you should never need any sleep with that.

343
00:21:48,604 --> 00:21:50,339
Oh, baby, unhealthy.

344
00:21:50,773 --> 00:21:52,208
I mean, why is it me? Why me?

345
00:21:52,341 --> 00:21:54,310
Well, maybe it's the way he had all stress,
huh?

346
00:21:56,712 --> 00:21:57,980
It's you're cooking, Eddie.

347
00:21:58,781 --> 00:22:03,619
That's right. You've been poisoning me with
your lard filled, vein clogging fat piece.

348
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:05,721
That's what it was. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

349
00:22:05,821 --> 00:22:07,857
You're the only one with high cholesterol
around here.

350
00:22:07,857 --> 00:22:12,528
Everybody else is fine and calm down no more
grapefruit in your stupid diet.

351
00:22:12,528 --> 00:22:13,963
Hey, hey, good night. Let's jump in the air.

352
00:22:13,996 --> 00:22:16,098
We go to Florida. Get some fresh grapefruit,
huh?

353
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,269
I'm dying. I'm dying.

354
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,773
Wow. Wow, no is getting over the good news
here.

355
00:22:24,507 --> 00:22:25,574
Unless you're some other business.

356
00:22:25,608 --> 00:22:28,978
No, nothing going on. Now I'm going to call
on our old buddy Glenn, who's in perfect

357
00:22:28,978 --> 00:22:30,212
health to give us the evening's
entertainment.

358
00:22:31,247 --> 00:22:33,482
All right. How do we look to you?

359
00:22:36,952 --> 00:22:41,157
Ok, I was going to read my last will and
testament, but I think I can scare up a few

360
00:22:41,157 --> 00:22:42,258
slides for you guys, huh?

361
00:22:43,626 --> 00:22:48,164
How far? Ready.

362
00:22:56,972 --> 00:22:59,508
Thanks, Bill. Well, we're not the No.

363
00:22:59,508 --> 00:23:01,010
Be the one with the health problem.

364
00:23:01,343 --> 00:23:04,847
I mean, he's always after us to eat better
and get in shape, and here it is that he's

365
00:23:04,847 --> 00:23:08,584
the reject. How can you not believe in God
when stuff like that happens?

366
00:23:09,552 --> 00:23:12,655
Anyway, if my wife is watching, I'll be
coming straight home after the meeting and

367
00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:14,190
apparently I'm in a lot better shape than I
look.

368
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:18,127
So I'd like to go back to not wearing any
pajamas unless there's a downside.

369
00:23:18,994 --> 00:23:22,898
So until next time, on behalf of myself and
Harold and the whole gang up here at Possum

370
00:23:22,898 --> 00:23:24,567
Lodge, keep your stick on the ice.

371
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:31,707
The bar made out of steel.

372
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:35,110
It's just all it's a big ball, steel ball,
yes, steel ball.

373
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,845
Can you throw it? No, it's really big.

374
00:23:36,879 --> 00:23:38,714
It's like, there's my head.

375
00:23:39,048 --> 00:23:40,883
That's that's like just on the camera
perspective.

376
00:23:41,884 --> 00:23:43,085
Yeah, I know about you.

377
00:23:43,686 --> 00:23:48,424
If actually that's out of the front window
of the five foot five foot like myself over

378
00:23:48,424 --> 00:23:51,360
there, I'd be I'd be dwarfed by it must be
huge.

379
00:23:52,261 --> 00:23:53,696
It's a huge steel ball.

380
00:23:54,229 --> 00:23:54,763
Unbelievable.
