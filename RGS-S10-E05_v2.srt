1
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:05,739
AWNINGS.

2
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:07,540
YOU KNOW THAT THING THAT WOULD
HANG DOWN OVER YOUR WINDOW?

3
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:10,143
I DON'T MEAN THE CREEPY GUY
IN THE TRENCH COAT.

4
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:12,746
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE CANOPIES THAT WOULD
KEEP THE DIRECT SUNLIGHT

5
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,214
OFF YOUR PARENTS'
GOOD FURNITURE;

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,182
YOU KNOW, THE STUFF
YOUR SISTER GOT.

7
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:19,386
WELL, HERE'S YOUR CHANCE TO
GET IN ON THE LATEST HOME
DECORATING TREND...

AWNINGS MADE FROM CAR HOODS.

9
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,025
CHEAP, EASY TO INSTALL,

10
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:28,128
AND THEY PROTECT THE HOUSE
AGAINST HURRICANES
AND TORNADOES

11
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,430
AND DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS --

12
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:32,599
IF THINGS GET TOO
HOT IN THE 'HOOD.

13
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:44,110
[cheers and applause]

14
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,755
THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

15
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,891
APPRECIATE IT.

16
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:59,692
YOU KNOW OUR LOCAL PAPER,

17
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,561
"THE POSSUM LAKE DAILY
MOVEMENT,"

18
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:04,230
THEY GOT A CONTEST GOING ON.

19
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,199
THEY'RE LOOKING TO NAME
A MAN OF THE YEAR

20
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,001
FROM THE POSSUM LAKE AREA.

21
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:10,036
NOMINATIONS ARE OPEN NOW,

22
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:12,839
AND THE WINNING CONTESTANT GETS
A BRAND NEW FISHING BOAT,

23
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:16,476
AND I'M THINKING YOURS TRULY
MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE A SHOT
AT THIS ONE.

24
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,279
HEY, Mr GREEN, DID YOU SEE
THIS MAN OF THE YEAR CONTEST?

25
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:20,447
I ALREADY GOT
A PAPER, MIKE.

26
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,514
YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO BUY ONE.

27
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,183
OH, THAT'S OKAY.
I GET 'EM FOR FREE.

28
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,752
[laughter]

29
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,387
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

30
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:31,291
[laughter]

31
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:33,927
I DON'T REMEMBER.

32
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,562
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THIS CONTEST.

33
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,931
I THINK THE LODGE SHOULD
NOMINATE SOMEBODY.

34
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:39,866
YEAH, OKAY, I KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GOING,

35
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,001
BUT DO YOU REALLY
THINK I HAVE A CHANCE?

36
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,370
[ CHUCKLING ]

37
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,774
NO, I'M TRYING TO BE
SERIOUS HERE, Mr GREEN.

38
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:50,910
I THOUGHT I'D HAD
A PRETTY GOOD YEAR.

39
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:53,146
YEAH, COMPARED TO THE OTHER
LODGE MEMBERS, MAYBE.

40
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:56,883
BUT THE REAL WORLD HAS A
WHOLE OTHER SENSE OF SCALE.

41
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,152
I MEAN, THIS CONTEST IS OPEN
TO THE WHOLE COMMUNITY...

42
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:01,554
POLICEMEN, DOCTORS,
FIREMEN,

43
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,823
BAIL BONDSMEN.

44
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,059
YOU KNOW, AS A GROUP,

45
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,261
WE'RE SUCKING
CANAL WATER.

46
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,396
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WHAT'S YOUR BIG IDEA?

47
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,332
I MADE UP A GUY.
WHAT?

48
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:14,968
I NAMED HIM
AFTER THE TIRE FIRE.

49
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,470
I CALL HIM
BERNIE GOODYEAR.

50
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,007
I MADE HIM A
RETIRED GENERAL.

51
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,442
SAYS HE DOES
VOLUNTEER WORK;

52
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,978
AND HE DONATES
TO AN ORPHANAGE.

53
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:27,580
AND I ALSO GAVE HIM
THE ORDER OF CANADA.

54
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:31,584
NO, THERE'S ANOTHER "R."
YOU'VE GOT THE 'ODOR'
OF CANADA.

55
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,054
OKAY, I'LL CHANGE THAT.

56
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,090
BUT I NEED YOU TO SIGN
THIS AS A NOMINATOR,

57
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:39,926
BECAUSE, LIKE, IF I SIGN IT,
THEY'LL THINK IT'S A SCAM.

58
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,195
IT'S DISCRIMINATION
BUT --

59
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:44,130
WELL, IT'S KIND
OF CROOKED.

60
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,565
MAYBE DALTON
WILL SIGN IT.

61
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,700
AH, COME ON, Mr GREEN,
BE A SPORT.

62
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:50,637
I MEAN, NOBODY AT THE LODGE
HERE IS GOOD ENOUGH TO BE
MAN OF THE YEAR.

63
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,974
BUT BERNIE GOODYEAR CAN SET AN
EXAMPLE FOR US ALL TO FOLLOW.

64
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,809
PLUS HERE'S
THE GOOD BIT.

65
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:59,179
"IF HE WINS, HE'S
INSTRUCTED THE JUDGES

66
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:02,549
"TO GIVE THE FISHING
BOAT TO THE POSSUM LODGE."

67
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,784
OH, MAN, THIS BERNIE
SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT GUY.

68
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,653
[applause]

69
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,932
IT'S TIME FOR
THE POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

70
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:24,003
[cheers and applause]

71
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,542
JOINING Mr GREEN TODAY IS
EXPLOSIVES ENTHUSIAST,

72
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,411
EDGAR MONTROSE.

73
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,813
[applause]

74
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,719
EDGAR WILL BE PLAYING
FOR A FULL BODY MASSAGE

75
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:43,022
FROM SIX-FINGER LOUIS
AT RUB-A-DUB-DUB
MASSAGE PARLOUR.

76
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,326
AND OIL CHANGE.

77
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,029
DON'T LET THE DIRTY
FINGERNAILS SCARE YOU OFF.

78
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,899
OKAY, Mr GREEN,
YOU'VE 30 SECONDS

79
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,968
TO GET Mr MONTROSE
TO SAY THIS WORD...

80
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,407
YEAH, YEAH.
ALL RIGHT, MIKE.

81
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:02,742
AND GO!

82
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,410
ALL RIGHT, EDGAR,

83
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,411
YOU USE YOUR
NOSE FOR SMELLING;

84
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,046
YOUR HANDS FOR FEELING;

85
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,082
WHAT DO YOU USE
YOUR EARS FOR?

86
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:11,317
SEEING.

87
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,686
YOU USE YOUR EARS TO SEE?

88
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,623
YEAH, MY GLASSES SIT ON 'EM.

89
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,492
OKAY, NO.
THERE'S AN EXPRESSION...

90
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:22,262
"IF A TREE FALLS IN THE FOREST
AND NO ONE IS THERE,

91
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,131
"DOES ANYBODY BLANK IT?"

92
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,300
WHAT KIND OF BLANKET?

93
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,236
WE'RE ALMOST
OUTTA TIME, Mr GREEN.

94
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,738
REMEMBER A
FEW YEARS AGO,

95
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,906
YOU USED REAL DYNAMITE
IN YOUR FIREWORKS DISPLAY?

96
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,541
YOU BLEW UP CITY HALL.

97
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,443
THAT WAS A CROWD PLEASER.

98
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:40,880
I KNOW THAT, BUT THAT WAS ALSO
THE DAY YOU LOST YOUR...

99
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:45,785
DEMOLITION LICENSE.

100
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,854
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT
THEY TOLD ME AT
THE HEARING.

101
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,290
[cheering and applause]

102
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,635
[van chugging,
brakes squealing]


103
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:10,076
YOU PLANNING
ON GOING IN ANY
TIME SOON, DALTON?

104
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,278
WHAT TIME IS IT?

105
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,913
Red: I HAVE NO IDEA.

106
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:18,985
IT'S EITHER 1:17, 1:19,
OR SEPTEMBER 6th.

107
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,588
ANNE MARIE'S
GONNA KILL ME.

108
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,157
WELL, YOU COULD
FAKE AN INJURY,

109
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,758
PRETEND YOU WERE
IN AN ACCIDENT.

110
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,461
NO FAKE INJURY IS
GOING TO FOOL ANNE MARIE.

111
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,563
OH, WE COULD HELP
YOU OUT WITH THAT PART.

112
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,832
NO, THANK YOU.

113
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,267
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.

114
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,004
I GOT BUSTER HADFIELD'S PYJAMAS
IN THE BACK OF THE VAN.

115
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:42,308
YOU KNOW, THIS MAY NOT
BE A NEED TO KNOW.

116
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,811
NO, HE GAVE 'EM TO ME.
HE SAID THEY WERE BAD LUCK.

117
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,179
I WAS GONNA USE
'EM AS OIL RAGS,

118
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:48,114
BUT YOU COULD PUT
THEM ON, DALTON.

119
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,083
NOW, WHY WOULD I
WANNA DO THAT?

120
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:53,086
WELL, THEN YOU JUST STAND
ON THE PORCH AND PRETEND
YOU GOT LOCKED OUT.

121
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:56,556
YEAH, LIKE FRED FLINTSTONE.
"WILMA-A-A-A!"

122
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:02,929
GO ON UP THERE
AND KNOCK ON THE DOOR.

123
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,131
SHHH!
TURN YOUR LIGHTS OFF.

124
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,945
ANNE MARIE!
ANNE MARIE,
I'VE LOCKED MYSELF OUT.

125
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:22,949
Anne Marie:
WHO IS THAT? 

126
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,184
IT'S ME, HONEY,
IT'S DALTON.

127
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:28,588
I HEARD A NOISE ON THE PORCH
AND IT WOKE ME UP,

128
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,123
AND WHEN I CAME OUT
TO INVESTIGATE,

129
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,759
THE DOOR LOCKED BEHIND ME.

130
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,863
YOU ARE SUCH A MORON, 
YOU KNOW THAT?
 

131
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:39,432
YES, I AM.

132
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,033
DALTON? 

133
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,735
YES, DEAR.
COMING, DEAR.
 

134
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,638
HOW COME YOU'RE WEARING BUSTE 
HADFIELD'S PAJAMAS?
 

135
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,180
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS A BOY
I ALWAYS DREAMED

136
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,616
ABOUT BEING
A RIVERBOAT GAMBLER.

137
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,484
I'VE TAKEN SOME CHANCES
IN A BOAT A FEW TIMES

138
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,420
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING.

139
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:03,389
SO TODAY ON HANDYMAN CORNER,
I'VE COME ALL THE WAY UP
 

140
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,459
TO THE PORT ASBESTOS SHIPYARD,
AND I'M GONNA TURN THIS VAN

141
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,761
INTO A RIVERBOAT
PADDLE WHEELER.

142
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:13,433
I MIGHT EVEN TRY IT
WITH MY OWN VAN.

143
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,736
NOW, THE FIRST CONSIDERATION
HAS TO BE GETTING THE VAN
TO FLOAT,

144
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,838
ESPECIALLY FOR
YOU NON-SWIMMERS.

145
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,406
TAKE A BUNCH OF THESE PALLETS,

146
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,176
WHICH YOU CAN GET ANYWHERE
THAT THEY HAVE PALLETS

147
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,044
RATHER THAN FENCES.

148
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,580
THEN WHAT YOU WANNA DO IS FILL
THEM WITH FLOATATION.

149
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,348
NOW, YOU COULD USE THAT
STYROFOAM STUFF

150
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,250
IF YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY
MADE OF MONEY.

151
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,224
BUT I PREFER TO RECYCLE.

152
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,027
IF YOU'RE LIKE ME,

153
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,629
YOU GENERATE TWO OR THREE
HUNDRED OF THESE PLASTIC
MOTOR OIL BOTTLES

154
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:45,064
EVERY MONTH OR SO.

155
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,899
NOW INSTEAD OF HAVING TO
THROW THEM OUT THE WINDOW

156
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,935
OR LEAVE THEM IN THE CANADIAN
TIRE PARKING LOT,

157
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:51,204
YOU CAN HANG ONTO THEM,
PLUS ANY OTHER BOTTLES
YOU'VE GOT

158
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,173
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA USE
'EM AS FLOATATIONS ON
YOUR RIVER BOAT.

159
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,647
OKAY, THAT'S OUR HULL.

160
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,716
LOOKS LIKE HULL, DOESN'T IT?

161
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:07,453
NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO IS ADD THE
PADDLE WHEEL TO THE VAN ITSELF.

162
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,489
YOU KNOW, THE OLD WOOLWORTH
STORE IN TOWN

163
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:13,092
HAS HAD DECLINING
REVENUES SINCE 1957.

164
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,794
FINALLY CLOSED IT LAST YEAR.

165
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,529
WHEN THEY TORE IT DOWN,

166
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:19,632
I MANAGED TO GET MY HANDS
ON THIS OLD REVOLVING DOOR.

167
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,869
I WAS GONNA INSTALL IT
IN THE LODGE

168
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,571
TO SPEED UP THE EXIT TIME
ON MEXICAN NIGHT.

169
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,540
BUT INSTEAD I'M GOING TO TAKE
ALL THE WINDOWS OUT OF HER

170
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,542
AND USE THIS AS
MY PADDLE WHEEL.

171
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,414
WELL, THOSE EXTENSION LADDERS
SURE CAME IN HANDY

172
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,782
TO MOUNT THE UNIT TO.

173
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,317
AND YOU MAY NOTICE I'VE
ADDED A WHEEL RIM

174
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,253
TO THE OUTSIDE OF
MY PADDLE WHEEL.

175
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,088
AND THEN A
CORRESPONDING WHEEL RIM,

176
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,790
I'VE PUT ON THE OUTSIDE OF
ONE OF MY DRIVE WHEELS HERE.

177
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:47,927
NOW I JUST CONNECT THE TWO
TOGETHER, USING A SEAT BELT.

178
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,595
BUCKLE UP FOR SAFETY.

179
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:50,930
I ACTUALLY TOOK THE SEAT BELTS
OUT OF THE VAN.

180
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,398
I FIGURE WHEN YOU'RE
OUT ON THE WATER,

181
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,367
YOU REALLY DON'T WANT
TO HAVE A SEAT BELT ON.

182
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:56,502
OH, BY THE WAY,

183
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,004
I JACKED UP THE WHOLE
BACK END HERE.

184
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,906
THAT WAY WHEN
I PUT HER IN GEAR,

185
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,741
THERE GOES MY PADDLE WHEEL.

186
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:04,744
ACTUALLY WE TAPED ME PUTTING THE
VAN ONTO MY FLOATATION RAFT,

187
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,280
BUT WE'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO SHOW IT ON TELEVISION,

188
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,081
DUE TO A FEW
ENVIRONMENTAL INFRACTIONS

189
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:11,817
AND SOME INAPPROPRIATE LANGUAGE.

190
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,453
HERE'S SOMETHING YOU MIGHT
THINK ABOUT FOR YOUR
RIVER BOAT.

191
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,590
IT'S ACTUALLY JUST
A PIECE OF STOVE PIPE.

192
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,358
RAN THE EXHAUST SYSTEM
UP THROUGH IT.

193
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:22,228
AND HERE'S A TRICK TO GIVE IT
THAT BLACK RIVER BOAT SMOKE...

194
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,963
INSTEAD OF PUTTING
GASOLINE IN HER

195
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,799
I FILLED UP THE TANK
WITH DIESEL.

196
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,569
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN DON'T
FIND YOU HANDSOME,

197
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,537
THEY SHOULD AT
LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

198
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,673
THEY'LL FIND ME
ROLLING DOWN THE RIVER.

199
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,245
[foghorn blasting]

200
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,880
[applause]

201
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,791
YOU KNOW THE BEST
TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT
YOUR FRIENDS ARE REALLY LIKE

202
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:54,293
IS WHEN YOU'RE IN SOME KIND
OF A GROUP ENDEAVOR;

203
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,630
LIKE WHEN THEY'RE ALL
OVER HELPING YOU MOVE
SOMETHING HEAVY,

204
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,099
SAY, THE BEER FRIDGE --

205
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,201
SAY, THE BEER FRIDGE
ON PAY DAY.

206
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,339
THAT'S WHEN YOU
FIND OUT WHO'S WHO.

207
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,307
FIRST OF ALL YOU
GET THE QUITTERS.

208
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,875
THE ONES WHO JUST STEP BACK FROM
THE FRIDGE AND SAY,

209
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,210
"HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT,

210
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,945
"I FEEL LIKE I'M JUST
IN THE WAY HERE."

211
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,280
THEN YOU GET THE HISTORIAN.

212
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,182
STEPS BACK FROM THE FRIDGE,
PULLS OUT A CAMERA.

213
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:19,852
WANTS TO GET A PICTURE
OF YOU AND YOUR HERNIA.

214
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,554
NEXT YOU GET THE SUPERVISOR.

215
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,256
THEY STEP BACK AND THEY TURN
INTO SOME KIND OF A CHEERLEADER.

216
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,926
"ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
HEAVE!"

217
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,261
I ALMOST DID.

218
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,530
THEN YOU GET THE FAKERS.

219
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:32,665
THEY'RE THE TRICKIEST ONES.

220
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,300
YEAH, SURE, THEY BELLY
UP TO THE FRIDGE.

221
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,868
THEY SPIT ON THEIR HANDS.

222
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,536
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO
THE GRAB AND LIFT,

223
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,839
YOU HEAR THE TELL-TALE
TINKLING OF POCKET CHANGE.

224
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:42,174
YOU GOTTA KNOW WHO'S WHO

225
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:46,212
BECAUSE THESE GUYS ARE GONNA BE
YOUR PALLBEARERS ONE DAY.

226
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:49,015
THE LAST THING YOU WANT IS A
SUPERVISOR THERE GOING,

227
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,651
"EASY, EASY."

228
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:55,655
WHILE TWO FAKERS DROP YOU
HEAD FIRST INTO YOUR
FINAL RESTING PLACE.

229
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:01,727
YOU GOTTA WALK AROUND HEAVEN
LOOKING LIKE THE RCA DOG.

230
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,497
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

231
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,032
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

232
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,601
[applause]

233
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:11,904
HI, WINSTON ROTHSCHILD HERE

234
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:15,274
OF ROTHSCHILD'S SEWAGE AND
SEPTIC SUCKING SERVICES.

235
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,310
IF THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE AIR
THAT KNOCKS YOU OFF YOUR CHAIR,

236
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,179
JUST CALL ME,
AND I'LL BE THERE.

237
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,581
OR SEND UP A FLARE,
IF YOU DARE.

238
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,389
WELL, I GOT THE LODGE
MEMBERS TOGETHER.

239
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,892
TOLD THEM ABOUT THIS BERNIE
GOODYEAR THAT WE MADE UP

240
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:35,461
AND HOW WE WANT HIM TO WIN THE
MAN OF THE YEAR AWARD.

241
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,631
OLD MAN SEDGWICK SAID HE
ACTUALLY REMEMBERED THE GUY.

242
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,568
I REMINDED HIM THAT
BERNIE DOESN'T EXIST.

243
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,137
SOMETIMES I WONDER IF
OLD MAN SEDGWICK EXISTS.

244
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:48,374
BUT WHEN THEY HEARD
ABOUT THE FISHING BOAT,

245
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:49,975
THEY ALL LIKE THE IDEA
OF SHARING THAT,

246
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,178
SO WE'RE ALL GOING AROUND
TALKING UP BERNIE GOODYEAR

247
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,913
AS THE MAN OF THE YEAR.

248
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:56,849
HEY, Mr GREEN,
DID YOU SEE TODAY'S PAPER?

249
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,485
NO, I DIDN'T.
THE BOX WAS MISSING
FOR SOME REASON.

250
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,988
OH, SORRY.
IT'S BEHIND
THE LIQUOR STORE.

251
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,792
UH, THERE'S THIS BIG
ARTICLE ON BERNIE GOODYEAR.

252
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:09,295
"TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE."
OH, MAN, THEY'RE
ON TO US.

253
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,897
NO, NO, THEY'RE SAYING
HE'S A CHEAT AND A LIAR.

254
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:15,601
SOME WOMAN IN PORT ASBESTOS
SAID SHE HAD HIS BABY.

255
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,872
WELL, THAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE THE BERNIE I KNOW.

256
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,207
EXACTLY.

257
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,975
AND NOW THE TOWN COUNCIL
IS DEMANDING

258
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,344
THAT BERNIE COME FORWARD
AND FACE HIS ACCUSERS.

259
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:26,746
UNTIL HE DOES,
THEY'VE SUSPENDED

260
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,081
THE MAN OF THE YEAR
COMPETITION.

261
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,883
WELL, WE GOTTA GO DOWN
THERE AND STAND UP FOR HIM.

262
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,752
YOU KNOW WHO'S
BEHIND THIS?

263
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,387
THOSE GUYS FROM CARIBOU LODGE.
I HEARD THEY WANT ONE OF THEIR
MEMBERS TO WIN THE CONTEST.

264
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,123
YEAH, IT'S A SMEAR CAMPAIGN,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

265
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,891
YOU KNOW, IT'S A
SHAME THAT THEY

266
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,626
HAVE TO RESORT
TO LIES AND TRICKERY

267
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,294
JUST TO GET
WHAT THEY WANT!

268
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,296
WELL, MIKE,
THAT'S HUMAN NATURE.

269
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:45,931
[applause]

270
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,168
OH, HELLO, BOYS AND GIRLS.

271
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:52,872
RANGER GORD HERE WITH
ANOTHER HOMEMADE ANIMATED
EDUCATIONAL FILM

272
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,274
YOU ALL SEEM TO ENJOY SO MUCH.

273
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:59,211
WELL, JUDGING BY
THE MAIL, THAT IS.

274
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:03,449
WHAT I MEAN, IS JUDGING BY THE
LACK OF ANY NEGATIVE MAIL,

275
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:06,619
[wailing]
OR ANY MAIL, REALLY!

276
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,854
[sobbing]

277
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,390
BUT THAT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM.

278
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:15,094
ANYWAY, TODAY'S FILM IS
ABOUT PEOPLE WHO THINK
THEY KNOW THINGS

279
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,762
BUT THEY REALLY DON'T.

280
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,331
NOW, LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN GUESS
WHO I'M TALKING ABOUT HERE,

281
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,133
AND I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT...

282
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,769
IT'S RED AND HAROLD.

283
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,704
OKAY?
GOOD LUCK.

284
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:26,872
HERE WE GO.

285
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,044
[quirky upbeat music]

286
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:37,149
[quirky upbeat music]

287
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,595
[thunder and rain]

288
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,332
RANGER GORD,
UNCLE RED,

289
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,168
LOOK AT THE
BEAUTIFUL RAINBOW.

290
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:59,672
IT WAS ALMOST WORTH
GETTING SOAKING WET.

291
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:02,208
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL
THING TO BEHOLD.

292
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,476
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S MORE
BEAUTIFUL THAN THAT, THOUGH.

293
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,545
IT'S WHAT YOU CAN
FIND AT THE END OF IT.

294
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,448
WHAT'S AT THE END
OF A RAINBOW,
RANGER GORD?

295
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,384
AT THEN END OF EVERY
RAINBOW IS A DUFFEL BAG

296
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,053
STUFFED WITH
UNMARKED BILLS.

297
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,255
OH, THAT'S NOT TRUE!

298
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,824
OH, I THINK MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO
AND CHECK IT OUT,

299
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,426
BECAUSE MAYBE WE
COULD GO AND SEE

300
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,462
BECAUSE, LIKE -- MONEY --
WE COULD ALL GET SOME OF IT.

301
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:28,334
HA HA, IF ONLY IT
WERE THAT EASY, HAROLD.

302
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,469
THE PROBLEM IS THE DUFFEL BAG
AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW

303
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:33,372
IS GUARDED BY
A MAGIC ANVIL.

304
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,407
WAH, A MAGIC ANVIL?

305
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,109
IT'S A MYTH, HAROLD.

306
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:39,245
AND GORD DOESN'T
EVEN HAVE IT RIGHT.

307
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,013
THERE'S A POT OF GOLD
AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW,

308
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,982
AND IT'S GUARDED
BY A LEPRECHAUN,

309
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,517
NOT A MAGIC ANVIL.

310
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,156
WOW! GORD WAS RIGHT.

311
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,425
UNBELIEVABLE!

312
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,494
WOW!
WAH!

313
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,099
AREN'T YOU TWO
FORGETTING SOMETHING?

314
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,573
WELL, I THINK YOU TWO HAVE HAD
ENOUGH FUN FOR ONE DAY.

315
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:10,376
SO DON'T BE LIKE
HAROLD AND RED, FOLKS.

316
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,479
THE MONEY AT THE END OF THE
RAINBOW CAN'T BUY YOU HAPPINESS.

317
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:16,015
IT CAN ONLY DROP A
MAGIC ANVIL ON YOUR HEAD.

318
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,317

[telephone ringing]

321
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,073
IF YOU'RE LIKE ME, YOU GET
A LOT OF ANNOYING PHONE CALLS,

322
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,841
USUALLY AROUND
THE DINNER HOUR.

323
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,677
SOME GUY TRYING TO SELL
YOU USED ALUMINUM SIDING

324
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:46,378
OR A VACUUM CLEANER THAT
CAN SUCK UP A BOWLING BALL.

325
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,547
[telephone ringing]

326
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:53,085
I FIGURE THERE'S A LIST OUT
THERE SOMEWHERE WITH ALL
OUR PHONE NUMBERS ON IT.

327
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:56,388
WE GOTTA FIND A WAY TO GET OUR
NUMBERS OFF OF THAT LIST.

328
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,990
SO HERE'S WHAT YOU DO.

00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,358
[telephone ringing]

330
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,327
Good evening, could I speak
to the head of the --

331
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,362
USE SOMEBODY'S BUSINESS CARD

332
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:06,131
AND DIAL UP THEIR FAX NUMBER.

333
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:10,336
THEN WHAT YOU WANNA DO IS GET
YOURSELF ONE OF THOSE TAPE
RECORDER UNITS THERE

334
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:14,340
AND RECORD THE SOUND THAT THEIR
FAX MACHINE MAKES WHEN IT
ANSWERS THE PHONE.

335
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:18,978
[ ELECTRONIC BEEPING
OF FAX MACHINE ]

336
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,046
THEN YOU JUST REWIND THE TAPE,

337
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,848
TURN THE VOLUME UP FULL,

338
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,050
AND WAIT FOR THE
NEXT SALESMAN TO CALL.

340
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,087
Good evening, could I speak --

[applause]

343
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,896
WELCOME TO THE EXPERTS PORTION
OF THE SHOW,

344
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:39,732
WHERE WE ADDRESS THOSE THREE
LITTLE WORDS

345
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,001
THAT MEN FIND SO HARD TO SAY...

346
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:45,471
Audience: I DON'T KNOW.

347
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,106
TODAY'S LETTER READS...

348
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,709
"DEAR EXPERTS, LAST NIGHT I
CELEBRATED A LITTLE TOO MUCH,

349
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:54,046
"WAS ARRESTED IN A HOTEL ROOM
WITH TWO STRANGE WOMEN,

350
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:59,184
"AND LOST MY WIFE'S CAR IN A
HIGH STAKES GAMBLING MATCH.

351
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,787
"AND NOW SHE'S REALLY
MAD AT ME.

352
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:06,525
"HOWEVER, I'VE FIGURED A WAY
TO GET OUT OF THIS TROUBLE
SCOT FREE.

353
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,794
"IN ORDER FOR MY PLAN TO
SUCCEED, HOWEVER,

354
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,330
"I NEED YOUR
EXPERT OPINION.

355
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,133
"IS TIME TRAVEL POSSIBLE?"

356
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,870
SIGNED "READY TO
LEAVE YESTERDAY."

357
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:20,939
GENTLEMEN?

358
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,075
WELL, IN THEORY,
YOU KNOW, IT IS.

359
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,477
MAYBE NOT NOW,
BUT IN THE FUTURE,

360
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,212
CERTAINLY.

361
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,714
WELL, JUST A
SECO NOW.

362
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,517
I WOULD THINK THAT IF
TIME TRAVEL IS GOING TO
BE POSSIBLE IN THE FUTURE,

363
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:35,754
THEN BY NOW, SOMEBODY FROM
THE FUTURE WOULD HAVE COME
BACK TO SEE US.

364
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,123
WELL, THEY DO.
THAT'S WHAT UFOs ARE,

365
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,559
PEOPLE COMING BACK
FROM THE FUTURE.

366
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,895
GEE WHIZ.
IT'S IN ALL THE PAPERS.

367
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:44,863
OH, YEAH?
WHAT PAPERS
ARE THOSE, DALTON?

368
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,832
THE ONES YOU PUT
UNDER THE PUPPY?

369
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:50,736
YOU ARE SO SKEPTICAL.

370
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,372
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT I'M NOT A
SUPER-INTELLIGENT ALIEN

371
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:56,208
THAT'S COME BACK
FROM THE FUTURE?

372
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,379
BECAUSE I WENT TO
SCHOOL WITH YOU.

373
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:05,050
UH, COULD WE ANSWER
THIS GUY'S LETTER, PLEASE?

374
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,785
ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY,

375
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,021
BUT TIME TRAVEL MAKES
NO SENSE TO ME AT ALL.

376
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,356
EVEN IF IT WAS POSSIBLE,
I WOULDN'T WANNA GO
BACK IN THE PAST.

377
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,094
MY TIME MACHINE WOULD BREAK,
AND I GOTTA TRY AND FIX IT
WITH EDSEL PARTS.

378
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,563
AND I SURE AS HECK DON'T
WANNA GO INTO THE FUTURE.

379
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:21,066
I CAN'T OPERATE THE
APPLIANCES I GOT NOW.

380
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:25,204
SO YOU WOULD ADVISE
OUR VIEWER TO ABANDON THE
WHOLE TIME TRAVEL CONCEPT?

381
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,672
OH, COMPLETELY ABANDON THAT.

382
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,208
THIS GUY JUST NEEDS
TO GET AWAY AND LIE LOW.

383
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:32,144
HE DOESN'T NEED TIME TRAVEL,
HE NEEDS TRAVEL TIME.

384
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,946
[laughter]

385
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,715
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF
TIME TRAVEL WAS POSSIBLE?

386
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,617
WHEN WOULD YOU
GUYS GO BACK TO?

387
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,285
OH, BOY.

388
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:43,388
I'D PROBABLY GO BACK
TO THE DATE OF MY BIRTH.

389
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,324
I'D PROBABLY GO BACK TO NINE
MONTHS BEFORE THAT.

390
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,593
THEN I COULD MEET MY DAD.

391
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,895
[laughter]

392
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:55,601
WHAT ABOUT YOU,
Mr GREEN?

393
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,003
I THINK I'D GO
BACK TEN MINUTES
AND BURN THAT LETTER.

394
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,707
[laughter and applause]

ROTHSCHILD'S SEWAGE AND
SEPTIC SUCKING SERVICES.

396
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:12,050
COVER ME.
I'M GOING IN.

397
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,620
[applause and laughter]

398
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:20,025
WELL, I'M NOT EXACTLY
SURE WHAT HAPPENED,

399
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,694
BUT I DO KNOW WE DON'T
HAVE A NEW FISHING BOAT.

400
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:25,430
YEAH, BUT THE GUYS FROM
THE CARIBOU LODGE DO.

401
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,099
UNBELIEVABLE.

402
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,067
THEY GOT UP IN FRONT
OF THE TOWN COUNCIL.

403
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,570
THEY ACCUSED BERNIE GOODYEAR
OF EVERY SIN KNOWN TO MAN

404
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,740
AND A COUPLE OF NEW ONES
THEY MADE UP THEMSELVES.

405
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,343
THEN Mr GREEN, HE GOT UP AND
DENIED ALL THE ACCUSATIONS,

406
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:41,280
AND THEN HE PRESENTED
Mr GOODYEAR AS THAT
WONDERFUL GUY

407
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,116
THAT WE ALL CAME
TO KNOW AND LOVE.

408
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,717
YOU WERE GREAT, Mr GREEN.

409
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,619
I WAS MOVED.

410
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,888
I WISH THE TOWN COUNCIL
HAD SEEN IT THAT WAY, MIKE.

411
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,823
WELL, YOU WERE LYING.

412
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,027
SO WERE THEY.

413
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,295
YES, BUT HERE AGAIN,

414
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,096
PEOPLE WOULD RATHER
BELIEVE A HURTFUL LIE

415
00:19:58,163 --> 00:19:59,965
THAN A HELPFUL ONE.

416
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:03,235
AND I'VE GOT THE
RAP SHEET TO PROVE IT.

417
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:07,005
SO THEN THE CARIBOU LODGE
GUYS CUT THEMSELVES A DEAL.

418
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,975
THEY TOLD TOWN COUNCIL THEY'D
GET RID OF BERNIE GOODYEAR

419
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,277
IN A PEACEFUL,
NON-VIOLENT WAY,

420
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,880
AND THEY GUARANTEED
THEM THAT BERNIE

421
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,482
WOULD NEVER SHOW HIS
FACE IN THE POSSUM
LAKE AREA AGAIN.

422
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:21,220
AND ALL THEY WANTED IN RETURN
WAS THE PRIZE FISHING BOAT.

423
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,222
WITH THE PROVISO
THEY'D GIVE THE BOAT BACK

424
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,657
IF BERNIE EVER
SHOWED UP IN TOWN.

425
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,260
THAT'S WHEN I KNEW THE
SCAM HAD GONE TOO FAR.

426
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,729
WELL, YOU TRIED TO DO THE
RIGHT THING, Mr GREEN.

427
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,197
YOU REALLY DID.

428
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,900
YEP, I TOLD 'EM BERNIE
GOODYEAR DIDN'T EXIST.

429
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,401
I TOLD 'EM
WE MADE HIM UP.

430
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:39,204
THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE IT.
DIDN'T BELIEVE IT.

431
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:44,076
I FOUND THAT IRONIC.

432
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:47,613
OH, WELL, I'M JUST SORRY
YOU DIDN'T WIN MAN OF
THE YEAR, Mr GREEN.

433
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,848
WELL, MIKE, I LIED,
I CHEATED,

434
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,517
AND I TRIED TO GET SOMETHING
UNDER FALSE PRETENSES.

435
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,786
FORGET MAN OF THE YEAR,
I SHOULD'VE RUN FOR
PRESIDENT.

436
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:57,656
[laughter and applause]

437
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,526
[possum squealing]

438
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,829
OH, MEETING TIME, Mr GREEN.

439
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,664
YEAH, YOU GO AHEAD, MIKE.
I'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.

440
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:06,999
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

441
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:08,300
SO IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

442
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,135
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

443
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,004
I DID LEARN SOMETHING TODAY.

444
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,073
I LEARNED THAT IF YOU'RE HONEST,
YOU CAN STOP TALKING ANY TIME
YOU WANT,

445
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,976
BUT WHEN YOU LIE, YOU GOTTA JUST
KEEP HER ROLLING AND ROLLING...

446
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,813
BOY, YOUR SISTER TALKS A LOT,
DOESN'T SHE?

447
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,283
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

448
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,418
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND BERNIE GOODYEAR

449
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,153
AND THE WHOLE GANG UP
HERE AT POSSUM LODGE,

450
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:29,821
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

451
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:32,524
[applause and cheering]

452
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,163
SIT DOWN.
SIT DOWN.

453
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:39,498
EVERYBODY, SIT DOWN.

454
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,400
SIT, SIT DOWN.

455
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,536
ALL RISE!

456
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:50,175
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI. 

457
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:53,011
Red: SIT DOWN.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,

458
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,347
BOW YOUR HEADS FOR
THE MAN'S PRAYER.

459
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,783
I'M A MAN,
BUT I CAN CHANGE,

460
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:00,285
IF I HAVE TO,
I GUESS.

461
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,922
Red: YES, DALTON?

462
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,190
Dalton: OKAY, I HAVE AN
IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT.

463
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:07,926
CARIBOU LODGE IS SAYING THEIR
FISHING BOAT IS MISSING,

464
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,495
AND THEY'RE CLAIMING THAT
MAYBE ONE OR MORE MEMBERS
OF THIS LODGE

465
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:12,064
HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.

466
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,599
AND THEY'RE ASKING FOR OUR
COOPERATION.

467
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:23,275
Red: OKAY, DALTON, I THINK I
KNOW WHO TOOK THE FISHING BOAT.

468
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,977
BERNIE GOODYEAR!
