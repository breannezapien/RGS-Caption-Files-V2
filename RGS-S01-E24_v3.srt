ISOLATE THEM BY PUTTING HOLES

109

CLEAN AS A WHISTLE, NO CRACKS,

143
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,327

144
00:04:55,327 --> 00:04:57,129
THE ADDED BENEFIT OF THE FRESH

AT YOU WHILE YOU'RE DRIVING.

AND ANY OF THE DOWNSIDE OF THIS

148
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:04,570
PARTICULAR REPAIR JOB IS MORE

149
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,272
THAN OFFSET BY MY AUXILIARY

151
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,109
SO THAT'S HOW EASY IT IS TO DO

00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:11,443
YOUR OWN WINDSHIELD REPAIRS.

153
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:13,012
I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND SOME

155
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:14,680
YOU'RE BREAKING THE GLASS,

THOUGH.

157
00:05:15,347 --> 00:05:17,883
SO UNTIL NEXT TIME, REMEMBER,

158
00:05:17,883 --> 00:05:18,884
IF WOMEN DON'T FIND YOU

159

00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,958
FIRST, IT'S A JACK-O'-LANTERN,

174
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,794
THEN IT'S A PUMPKIN PIE.

175
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,295
WOULD HAVE TASTED BETTER IF WE'D

176
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:05,264
TAKEN OUT THE CANDLE."

177
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:09,568
SO ANYWAY, AS I WAS SAYING,

178
00:06:09,568 --> 00:06:10,402
WE WANTED TO BUILD THIS

179
00:06:10,402 --> 00:06:11,804
WATERSLIDE, AND THE FIRST THING

180
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,505
WE NEEDED WAS THE SLIDE PART,

181
00:06:13,505 --> 00:06:14,706
AND, BOY, THOSE THINGS

182
00:06:14,706 --> 00:06:15,707
ARE EXPENSIVE,

183
00:06:15,707 --> 00:06:17,676
SO WHAT WE DID WAS, WE WENT OUT

184
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:20,379
AT NIGHT AND WE JUST STOLE

185
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,981
ANIMAL FEED TROUGHS FROM FARMS

186
00:06:22,981 --> 00:06:24,816
IN THE AREA.

187
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:25,817
WHAT THE HECK, YOU KNOW, I MEAN,

188
00:06:25,817 --> 00:06:27,352
ANIMALS HAVING A PLACE TO EAT IS

189
00:06:27,352 --> 00:06:28,420
NOT NEAR AS IMPORTANT AS US

190
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,922
HAVING FUN.

191
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,089
AND BESIDES, THEM FARMERS

192
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:32,291
ARE ALL ON GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES

193
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,292
ANYWAY.

194
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,160
>> RED, I DON'T THINK YOU CAN

195
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,762
JUSTIFY TROUGH THEFT BY SAYING

196
00:06:36,762 --> 00:06:38,697
IT'S JUST FOR FUN, NOR TAKING A

197
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:40,098
CHEAP SHOT AT THE POOR FARMERS

198
00:06:40,098 --> 00:06:41,333
OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY.

199
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,668
DOESN'T DO MUCH FOR YOUR IMAGE,

200
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,136
AND I'LL ADMIT I'M DISAPPOINTED

201
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:45,804
IN YOU, UH-HUH,

202
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:47,372
SPEAKING AS YOUR NEPHEW.

203
00:06:47,372 --> 00:06:51,209
>> IT'S JUST A STORY, HAROLD.

204
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:52,611
ALL RIGHT.

205
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:53,579
WE DIDN'T STEAL THE FEED

206
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,580
TROUGHS.

207
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,581
WE FOUND THEM ON OUR OWN

208
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,582
PROPERTY...

209
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,250
EVENTUALLY.

210
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,584
AND MAYBE I'M WRONG.

211
00:06:59,584 --> 00:07:01,119
MAYBE FARMERS AREN'T GETTING

212
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,521
GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES.

213
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:04,256
MAYBE THE ALFALFA CROP PAID FOR

214
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:05,090
THOSE CADILLACS.

215
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,591
I DON'T KNOW.

216
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:08,894
ANYWAY, WE ATTACHED THE TROUGHS

217
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:09,761
ALL TOGETHER USING THE

218
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:11,096
HANDYMAN'S SECRET WEAPON,

219
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:12,898
DUCT TAPE, AND THEN WE RAN

220
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:13,732
THE CHAIN OF TROUGHS

221
00:07:13,732 --> 00:07:14,933
FROM THE ROOF OF THE LODGE

222
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:16,935
ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE LAKE.

223
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:17,769
>> BOY, THAT SOUNDS GREAT,

224
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:18,437
UNCLE RED.

225
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:19,104
WAY TO GO.

226
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:20,105
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF WORK.

227
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:22,074
BREAK TIME.

228
00:07:24,476 --> 00:07:25,344
>> WELL, WHY WOULD I WANT TO

229
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:26,812
TAKE A BREAK NOW, HAROLD?

230
00:07:26,812 --> 00:07:28,814
>> BECAUSE, BASICALLY,

231
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:32,150
YOU'RE A KIND PERSON.

232
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,486
>> WE'RE OUT HERE ON LOCATION

233
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:36,121
WITH MY GOOD BUDDY

234
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:37,389
DOUGIE FRANKLIN RIGHT HERE

235
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:40,158
AND HIS AMAZING MONSTER TRUCK.

236
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:42,427
DOUGIE, HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

237
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:44,396
>> I'M FINE.

238
00:07:44,396 --> 00:07:45,263
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

239
00:07:45,263 --> 00:07:46,264
>> WELL, I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT,

240
00:07:46,264 --> 00:07:47,199
'CAUSE YOU KNOW, DOUG, THE LAST

241
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,433
TIME WE WERE HERE, DOUG SAID

242
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:49,634
HE'D TAKE US FOR A LITTLE SPIN

243
00:07:49,634 --> 00:07:51,236
IN THE TRUCK AND, WELL, WE'RE

244
00:07:51,236 --> 00:07:52,170
KIND OF EXCITED ABOUT IT.

245
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,038
SO TODAY'S THE DAY.

246
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:54,372
HERE WE ARE, DOUG.

247
00:07:54,372 --> 00:07:56,641
>> WELL, LAST TIME WHEN I MADE

248
00:07:56,641 --> 00:07:58,310
YOU THAT OFFER, RED, I HAD MY

249
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,644
LICENSE, AND I'M AFRAID IT'S

250
00:07:59,644 --> 00:08:02,247
BEEN SUSPENDED FOR A WHILE.

251
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:03,248
JUST A WHILE.

252
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:05,550
>> GOSH, DOUGIE, WHAT HAPPENED?

253
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,219
YOU GET A SPEEDING TICKET?

254
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:08,053
RUN A RED LIGHT?

255
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:08,720
HAVE AN ACCIDENT?

256
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,387
WHAT WAS IT?

257
00:08:09,387 --> 00:08:11,556
>> YEAH.

258
00:08:11,556 --> 00:08:13,058
>> OH, YOU HAD A BAD DAY.

259
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:14,559
>> WELL, I DID.

260
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:16,728
I WAS CAUGHT DOING ABOUT

261
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:17,863
60 MILE AN HOUR DOWN

262
00:08:17,863 --> 00:08:19,698
THE SIDEWALK.

263
00:08:19,698 --> 00:08:22,801
I TOOK OUT A RED LIGHT, AND,

264
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:24,202
ACTUALLY, I TOOK OUT THE POLE

265
00:08:24,202 --> 00:08:25,871
THAT WAS HOLDING IT UP AS WELL.

266
00:08:25,871 --> 00:08:27,873
[sighs]

267
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:30,041
AND I HAD A SLIGHT ALTERCATION

268
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:34,212
WITH A FEW AUTOMOTIVE VEHICLES.

269
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:35,547
>> A FEW?

270
00:08:35,547 --> 00:08:36,581
>> NINE OF THEM.

271
00:08:36,581 --> 00:08:37,415
NINE VEHICLES.

272
00:08:37,415 --> 00:08:38,083
NINE CARS.

273
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,751
[mumbles]

274
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:40,986
>> OH, MY GOSH.

275
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:42,320
WAS ANYBODY HURT?

276
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,489
>> WELL, THAT'S THE--

277
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:45,557
IF THERE'S AN UPSIDE,

278
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:46,358
THAT'D BE THE UPSIDE.

279
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:48,026
FORTUNATELY NOBODY WAS HURT.

280
00:08:48,026 --> 00:08:49,361
THEY WAS ALL PARKED, ALL NINE

281
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:50,562
OF THEM IN A ROW AT ONE OF THEM

282
00:08:50,562 --> 00:08:53,064
B.M.W. DEALERSHIPS.

283
00:08:53,064 --> 00:08:55,900
BIMMERS, I THINK THEY CALL THEM.

284
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,402
>> OH, MY GOSH, YOU RAN INTO

285
00:08:57,402 --> 00:08:59,504
NINE B.M.W.s?

286
00:08:59,504 --> 00:09:01,373
>> NO, IMELDA HERE,

287
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:04,042
SHE DOESN'T RUN INTO NOTHING.

288
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:06,511
I RAN OVER NINE B.M.W.s,

289
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:10,148
BUT FORTUNATELY, GOD BLESS HER,

290
00:09:10,148 --> 00:09:12,250
I'VE JUST GOT A LITTLE SCRATCH

291
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,785
ON THE BOTTOM OF MY OIL PAN.

292
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:14,652
WHEN YOU'RE MOUNTING ONE OF

293
00:09:14,652 --> 00:09:16,621
THOSE B.M.W.s, YOU KNOW, UP THE

294
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:18,023
SIDE, THE SUNROOF HAS A

295
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:19,124
TENDENCY TO FLIP UP ON YOU,

296
00:09:19,124 --> 00:09:19,858
AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

297
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:21,826
THE SUNROOF COME UP--AND

298
00:09:21,826 --> 00:09:22,627
ACTUALLY, IT'S RIGHT UNDER

299
00:09:22,627 --> 00:09:23,294
THERE.

300
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:24,295
IT SCRAPED MY OIL PAN RIGHT OUT.

301
00:09:24,295 --> 00:09:25,296
>> OH, FOR GOSH SAKES.

302
00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:27,132
>> YEAH. IT'S OKAY.

303
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:28,166
>> I HOPE YOU WERE INSURED

304
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,300
FOR ALL THIS, DOUG.

305
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,970
>> WELL, I WAS INSURED,

306
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,973
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

307
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:36,408
I CALLED THE INSURANCE COMPANY,

308
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:39,244
YOU KNOW, MOMENTS AFTER.

309
00:09:39,244 --> 00:09:40,378
I HAD A FRIEND'S MOBILE PHONE

310
00:09:40,378 --> 00:09:42,347
IN THE--IN IMELDA THERE.

311
00:09:42,347 --> 00:09:43,915
CALLED THEM AND THAT INSURANCE

312
00:09:43,915 --> 00:09:45,016
SALESMAN, HE WAS DOWN THERE IN

313
00:09:45,016 --> 00:09:46,017
JUST A MATTER OF MINUTES.

314
00:09:46,017 --> 00:09:46,918
HE MUST'VE LIVED RIGHT NEARBY.

315
00:09:46,918 --> 00:09:47,919
HE WAS A PERKY LITTLE FELLOW.

316
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,020
HE WAS RIGHT DOWN THERE, AND A

317
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,122
COUPLE OF MINUTES LATER, THIS

318
00:09:51,122 --> 00:09:53,024
INSURANCE ADJUSTER, I THINK THEY

319
00:09:53,024 --> 00:09:56,528
CALL 'EM, HE COME IN TOW, AND I

320
00:09:56,528 --> 00:09:58,496
GUESS PROBABLY ABOUT, OH, JUST A

321
00:09:58,496 --> 00:10:00,131
MATTER OF MINUTES AFTER HE WAS

322
00:10:00,131 --> 00:10:01,332
THERE, THIS CROWD STARTED

323
00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:02,534
GATHERING AROUND.

324
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:05,203
AND YOU KNOW, AS I'VE SAID,

325
00:10:05,203 --> 00:10:06,104
THERE'S A GOOD SIDE.

326
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:06,804
YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK ON THE

327
00:10:06,804 --> 00:10:07,472
BRIGHT SIDE.

328
00:10:07,472 --> 00:10:08,139
>> YEAH.

329
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:08,973
>> AND THE BRIGHT SIDE OF THIS

330
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:10,508
WAS, I GOT SOME GREAT PUBLICITY

331
00:10:10,508 --> 00:10:12,177
OUT OF IT,

332
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:14,012
AND I LEARNED SOMETHING.

333
00:10:14,012 --> 00:10:14,679
>> UH-HUH.

334
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,514
>> YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING IS--

335
00:10:16,514 --> 00:10:17,949
IT'S A BIG EXPERIENCE IN THIS

336
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:19,450
LIFE, AND I LEARNED SOMETHING.

337
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,452
I LEARNED THAT, FOR EXAMPLE,

338
00:10:21,452 --> 00:10:22,921
THEM POLES THAT HOLD UP THE

339
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:24,322
STOPLIGHTS, THEY HOLD UP A LOT

340
00:10:24,322 --> 00:10:25,156
MORE THAN THE STOPLIGHT.

341
00:10:25,156 --> 00:10:26,324
I'LL TELL YOU THAT RIGHT NOW.

342
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:28,793
THEY HOLD UP--THEY ALSO HOLD

343
00:10:28,793 --> 00:10:29,694
UP THE STREETLIGHT.

344
00:10:29,694 --> 00:10:31,963
THEY HOLD UP POWER TRANSFORMERS,

345
00:10:31,963 --> 00:10:34,532
AND THEY ALSO HOLD UP ENOUGH

346
00:10:34,532 --> 00:10:36,134
CABLE THERE, ENOUGH TO POWER UP

347
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:37,735
THE ENTIRE DOWNTOWN CORE.

348
00:10:37,735 --> 00:10:38,870
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

349
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,071
AND THERE'S ONE FUNNY THING

350
00:10:40,071 --> 00:10:40,738
I FOUND.

351
00:10:40,738 --> 00:10:43,308
IT JUST--IT'S LIKE A DREAM,

352
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:44,475
BUT I CAN REMEMBER IT.

353
00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:45,977
IT'S A FUNNY THING.

354
00:10:45,977 --> 00:10:47,645
YOU KNOW THEM BUS SHELTERS?

355
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:49,480
YOU HIT ONE OF THEM AT 60 MILE

356
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,716
AN HOUR, AND WHEN THEY EXPLODE,

357
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:52,884
THEY MAKE KIND OF PA!

358
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:54,052
A POPPIN' SOUND.

359
00:10:54,052 --> 00:10:55,320
IT'S LIKE, "BANG."

360
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,154
JUST ALL OVER.

361
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:57,822
THE FUNNIEST LITTLE SOUND.

362
00:10:57,822 --> 00:10:58,990
IT'S A WEIRD, WEIRD THING.

363
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,024
>> WELL, YOU LEARNED A LOT.

364
00:11:00,024 --> 00:11:00,725
>> I DID.

365
00:11:00,725 --> 00:11:02,393
IT'S--YOU DO LEARN, AND

366
00:11:02,393 --> 00:11:03,761
THERE'S A DOWNSIDE, BUT THERE'S

367
00:11:03,761 --> 00:11:05,163
ALWAYS AN UPSIDE.

368
00:11:05,163 --> 00:11:06,364
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING, I GUESS.

369
00:11:06,364 --> 00:11:07,532
>> BEST OF LUCK TO YOU, DOUGIE.

370
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:08,700
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

371
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,201
I APPRECIATE THAT, RED.

372
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:10,868
THANK YOU.

373
00:11:10,868 --> 00:11:12,704
>> DOUGIE FRANKLIN, A MAN WHO

374
00:11:12,704 --> 00:11:14,205
IS A LITTLE WISER.

375
00:11:14,205 --> 00:11:15,106
>> I AM.

376
00:11:15,106 --> 00:11:16,874
>> NOT TOO MUCH WISER,

377
00:11:16,874 --> 00:11:19,277
BUT A LITTLE WISER.

378
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:21,612
>> YOU GOT TO TAKE YOUR BUMPS.

379
00:11:21,612 --> 00:11:22,914
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING HERE:

380
00:11:22,914 --> 00:11:24,115
SITTING ON THIS BABY, AND I

381
00:11:24,115 --> 00:11:26,184
CAN'T DRIVE HER NOWHERE.

382
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:28,019
>> NINE B.M.W.s, EH?

383
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,687
>> [sighs] YEAH.

384
00:11:29,687 --> 00:11:30,521
I'LL TELL YOU, I LEARNED

385
00:11:30,521 --> 00:11:31,522
SOMETHING ELSE TOO.

386
00:11:31,522 --> 00:11:32,657
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THEM YUPPIES

387
00:11:32,657 --> 00:11:33,324
TOO MUCH.

388
00:11:33,324 --> 00:11:34,492
THEY WERE APPLAUDING

389
00:11:34,492 --> 00:11:35,993
WHEN THEY LOOKED AT

390
00:11:35,993 --> 00:11:36,994
THEM THINGS WRECKED.

391
00:11:36,994 --> 00:11:37,995
>> YEAH.

392
00:11:37,995 --> 00:11:39,163
>> I GUESS IT JUST GOES TO SHOW

393
00:11:39,163 --> 00:11:40,131
YOU, YOU DRIVE ONE OF THOSE,

394
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:41,165
ALL'S YOU'RE DOING IS TELLING

395
00:11:41,165 --> 00:11:42,567
EVERYBODY HOW MUCH MONEY YOU GOT

396
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:44,101
AND HOW LITTLE EVERYBODY ELSE

397
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:44,902
HAS, YOU KNOW?

398
00:11:44,902 --> 00:11:45,670
>> YEAH, YEAH.

399
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,671
WELL, YOU ROSE ABOVE THEM,

400
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:47,472
DIDN'T YOU?

401
00:11:47,472 --> 00:11:48,439
>> I CERTAINLY DID.

402
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:49,941
I ROSE ABOVE ALL OF THEM

403
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:50,875
AND OVER THEM

404
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,143
AND DOWN THE OTHER SIDE.

405
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:53,211
>> THAT'S THE IMPORTANT PART.

406
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:53,945
>> THAT WAS.

407
00:11:53,945 --> 00:11:56,614
I COME OUT AHEAD.

408
00:11:56,614 --> 00:11:57,448
[acoustic guitar music]

409
00:11:57,448 --> 00:11:59,116
>> THERE'S A TIME

410
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:00,451
IN THE EVENING

411
00:12:00,451 --> 00:12:03,521
WHEN EVERYTHING IS STILL

412
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:06,557
WHEN THE MOON'S DOING THINGS

413
00:12:06,557 --> 00:12:09,560
THAT THE SUN NEVER WILL

414
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,463
IT'S A MAGICAL TIME

415
00:12:12,463 --> 00:12:15,633
THAT'S GOOD FOR YOUR SOUL

416
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:16,934
THEN SOMEONE MAKES

417
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:18,569
AN INCREDIBLY RUDE NOISE

418
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:19,370
AND BRINGS YOU BACK

419
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,238
TO REALITY

420
00:12:20,238 --> 00:12:22,240
[laughter]

421
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,742
>> I SAID I WAS SORRY.

422
00:12:24,742 --> 00:12:28,412
>> YOU KILLED THE FIRE.

423
00:12:28,412 --> 00:12:29,580
>> UNCLE RED, I HOPE YOU'RE

424
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,915
READY FOR TODAY'S MAIL,

425
00:12:30,915 --> 00:12:32,183
BECAUSE WE GOT SOME INTERESTING

426
00:12:32,183 --> 00:12:33,017
QUESTIONS.

427
00:12:33,017 --> 00:12:34,185
BETTER PUT ON YOUR THINKING CAP.

428
00:12:34,185 --> 00:12:35,186
THEY'RE REALLY DEEP, AND WE WANT

429
00:12:35,186 --> 00:12:36,587
SOME DEEP ANSWERS.

430
00:12:36,587 --> 00:12:37,755
>> ALL RIGHT.

431
00:12:37,755 --> 00:12:39,423
50 FATHOMS.

432
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:41,592

THAT'S REALLY FUNNY, 'CAUSE I

438
00:12:47,164 --> 00:12:48,399
SAID SOME DEEP QUESTIONS, SO YOU

439
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,734
SAID, LIKE, A DEEP ANSWER,

440
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:50,601
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW, LIKE, THEY

441
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:51,635
MEASURE THE DEPTH OF WATER--

442
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:53,137
BODIES OF WATER WITH FATHOMS.

443
00:12:53,137 --> 00:12:54,638
HA! 50 FATHOMS.

444
00:12:54,638 --> 00:12:55,506
[laughs]

445
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:56,340
I'M GONNA WRITE THAT DOWN,

446
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,008
UNCLE RED.

447
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:58,009
THAT'S ONE OF YOUR BETTER ONES.

448
00:12:58,009 --> 00:12:58,676
FATHOMS.

449
00:12:58,676 --> 00:12:59,443
50 FATHOMS.

450
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:00,611
HOW DO YOU SPELL "FATHOMS"?

451
00:13:00,611 --> 00:13:01,612
>> JUST READ THE LETTER, HAROLD.

452
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:02,279
>> I SHOULD JUST

453
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:02,947
PROBABLY WRITE--

454
00:13:02,947 --> 00:13:04,782
>> DON'T MAKE ME KILL YOU.

455
00:13:04,782 --> 00:13:08,085
>> ALL RIGHT, LETTER NUMBER ONE.

456
00:13:08,085 --> 00:13:10,388
"DEAR, RED, WHAT IS THE MEANING

457
00:13:10,388 --> 00:13:12,423
OF LIFE?"

458
00:13:12,423 --> 00:13:13,724
>> ALL RIGHT, HAROLD,

459
00:13:13,724 --> 00:13:15,626
I'D LIKE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION

460
00:13:15,626 --> 00:13:17,194
IN TWO PARTS.

461
00:13:17,194 --> 00:13:20,698
WHO KNOWS AND WHO CARES?

462
00:13:20,698 --> 00:13:21,899
>> EXCELLENT.

463
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:23,467
THAT'S REALLY DEEP.

464
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:24,668
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

465
00:13:24,668 --> 00:13:25,603
THAT'S GREAT.

466
00:13:25,603 --> 00:13:26,570
IT'S VERY, WHAT DO THEY SAY,

467
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,272
IT'S LIKE, EXISTENTIAL.

468
00:13:28,272 --> 00:13:28,939
WHO CARES?

469
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:29,807
THAT'S EXISTENTIALISM,

470
00:13:29,807 --> 00:13:31,642
OR IS IT ALIENATION?

471
00:13:31,642 --> 00:13:32,476
CONFUSION?

472
00:13:32,476 --> 00:13:33,177
IS IT CONFUSION MORE SO--

473
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:33,844
>> NEXT LETTER, HAROLD.

474
00:13:33,844 --> 00:13:34,678
>> THE NEXT LETTER.

475
00:13:34,678 --> 00:13:35,546
MIGHT HAVE ANSWERED IT, BUT...

476
00:13:35,546 --> 00:13:36,380
ALL RIGHTY, HERE WE GO.

477
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,381
LETTER NUMBER TWO.

478
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:39,150
"DEAR, RED, DO YOU THINK WE

479
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,184
SHOULD TEACH THE BIBLE IN

480
00:13:40,184 --> 00:13:42,386
SCHOOL?"

481
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:44,054
>> WELL, HAROLD, AS YOU KNOW,

482
00:13:44,054 --> 00:13:46,023
I READ THE BIBLE A GREAT DEAL,

483
00:13:46,023 --> 00:13:47,224
WITH THE AMOUNT OF TIME I SPEND

484
00:13:47,224 --> 00:13:50,227
IN MOTELS, AND I FIND THAT

485
00:13:50,227 --> 00:13:52,062
THE BIBLE HAS A GREAT DEAL TO

486
00:13:52,062 --> 00:13:54,598
SAY TO YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY, EVEN

487
00:13:54,598 --> 00:13:56,967
20 CENTURIES AFTER IT'S WRITTEN.

488
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:57,935
I THINK YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD

489
00:13:57,935 --> 00:13:59,270
READ THE BIBLE, AND THEY SHOULD

490
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,037
ENJOY IT.

491
00:14:00,037 --> 00:14:01,405
IT HAS A LOT TO TEACH THEM AND

492
00:14:01,405 --> 00:14:02,740
HAS SOME TREMENDOUS INSIGHTS

493
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,975
INTO LIFE, SO, NO, I THINK THEY

494
00:14:04,975 --> 00:14:05,843
SHOULD KEEP IT OUT OF THE SCHOOL

495
00:14:05,843 --> 00:14:07,344
SYSTEM ALL TOGETHER.

496
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:08,512
>> THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

497
00:14:08,512 --> 00:14:09,680
WONDERFUL, UNCLE RED.

498
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,148
OKAY, LETTER NUMBER THREE.

499
00:14:11,148 --> 00:14:13,284
"DEAR, RED, SOMETIMES I STAND

500
00:14:13,284 --> 00:14:14,785
ALONE ON THE TOP OF A HILL AT

501
00:14:14,785 --> 00:14:16,453
NIGHT AND STARE UP AT THE STARS

502
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:18,489
FOR HOURS AND HOURS, MARVELING

503
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:20,257
AT THEIR BEAUTY AND COMPLEXITY,

504
00:14:20,257 --> 00:14:21,725
AND THEN SUDDENLY I BURST INTO

505
00:14:21,725 --> 00:14:23,060
TEARS AND THROW UP.

506
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,962
AND I WONDER, ARE WE ALONE

507
00:14:24,962 --> 00:14:27,798
IN THIS UNIVERSE?"

508
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:28,866
>> WELL, I'M NOT, BUT IT

509
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:31,168
SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE.

510
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:32,770
>> THAT WAS VERY NICE.

511
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,772
IT WAS--I MEAN, PERHAPS A BIT

512
00:14:34,772 --> 00:14:36,173
INSENSITIVE, GRANTED, BUT IT WAS

513
00:14:36,173 --> 00:14:37,541
DIRECT TO THE VIEWER.

514
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,709
THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING,

515
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:40,044
I SUPPOSE.

516
00:14:40,044 --> 00:14:42,046
OKAY, WELL THAT'S VERY GOOD.

517
00:14:42,046 --> 00:14:43,881
WELL ANSWERED.

518
00:14:43,881 --> 00:14:45,983
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, UNCLE RED.

519
00:14:45,983 --> 00:14:47,317
HA-HA! FATHOMS.

520
00:14:47,317 --> 00:14:49,286
[laughs]

521
00:14:51,555 --> 00:14:52,456
>> SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT

522
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:54,558
DIFFERENT FOR YOU ON THIS

523
00:14:54,558 --> 00:14:56,060
ADVENTURE WITH BILL THIS WEEK.

524
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,960
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU ABOUT

525
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,728
SIGNALING.

526
00:14:57,728 --> 00:14:59,196
WHAT THAT THING THERE IS, IT'S

527
00:14:59,196 --> 00:15:01,632
SOME SORT OF A SMOKE, SMOG BOMB.

528
00:15:01,632 --> 00:15:03,100
BILL, YOU KNOW, GOES JUST A

529
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,735
LITTLE BIT TOO FAR, AND IF YOU

530
00:15:04,735 --> 00:15:06,370
INHALE THAT STUFF, APPARENTLY,

531
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,338
IT CAN KILL YOU.

532
00:15:08,338 --> 00:15:09,540
HOWEVER, THESE ARE THE CHANCES

533
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,207
YOU TAKE.

534
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:11,075
AND THIS IS A BIG MIRROR.

535
00:15:11,075 --> 00:15:11,842
HE'S GONNA--OH, THANK YOU,

536
00:15:11,842 --> 00:15:13,010
BILL, THANK YOU.

537
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,578
THIS IS REAL GREAT, YOU KNOW,

538
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:15,746
IN EVERY WAY.

539
00:15:15,746 --> 00:15:16,547
AND OF COURSE HE--

540
00:15:16,547 --> 00:15:17,881
>> [screeches]

541
00:15:17,881 --> 00:15:19,516
>> AND NOW BILL CAN'T SEE WHERE

542
00:15:19,516 --> 00:15:20,184
HE'S GOING AND--

543
00:15:20,184 --> 00:15:21,151
>> WHOA!

544
00:15:21,151 --> 00:15:24,888
>> OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH.

545
00:15:24,888 --> 00:15:26,256
WELL, YOU CAN EVEN SIGNAL WITH

546
00:15:26,256 --> 00:15:28,959
PIECES OF A MIRROR, APPARENTLY.

547
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:29,960
LUCKILY WE BROUGHT THE

548
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,794
SUNGLASSES WITH US.

549
00:15:30,794 --> 00:15:31,728
AND HERE'S SOME OTHER THINGS YOU

550
00:15:31,728 --> 00:15:32,963
CAN SIGNAL WITH, LIKE A LADIES'

551
00:15:32,963 --> 00:15:35,499
HAND MIRROR AND A BUTCHER KNIFE,

552
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:37,034
WHICH ISN'T A BAD IDEA TO HAVE

553
00:15:37,034 --> 00:15:38,702
AROUND WHEN BILL'S THERE.

554
00:15:38,702 --> 00:15:40,704
THE MIRROR OFF MY VAN AND JUST

555
00:15:40,704 --> 00:15:43,040
A LITTLE LIGHTER, AND I GUESS

556
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,541
THAT'S A--THAT'D BE FRY PAN

557
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,843
THERE.

558
00:15:45,843 --> 00:15:47,511
THIS IS A BUST OF ELVIS.

559
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:48,412
YOU DON'T HAVE TOO MANY OF

560
00:15:48,412 --> 00:15:49,613
THOSE, BUT THEY GOT THE SILVER

561
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:50,714
SUNGLASSES ON THEM, AND YOU CAN

562
00:15:50,714 --> 00:15:51,448
SIGNAL WITH THOSE.

563
00:15:51,448 --> 00:15:52,816
AND A CAN OF--

564
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:56,920
OH, OH, I SHOULD HAVE SAID AN

565
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,257
EMPTY CAN IS PROBABLY BETTER.

566
00:16:00,257 --> 00:16:00,958
LOOK AT THAT.

567
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,125
SPAGHETTI-O CAN REALLY STICK

568
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,760
TO YOU.

569
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,262
AND THEN THERE'S THE WHISTLE,

570
00:16:05,262 --> 00:16:06,396
BUT BILL, BILL.

571
00:16:06,396 --> 00:16:07,064
[whistle blows]

572
00:16:07,064 --> 00:16:09,032
OH, OH, OH, IS THAT LOUD.

573
00:16:09,032 --> 00:16:12,202
OH, OW, OW, OW.

574
00:16:12,202 --> 00:16:13,337
OH.

575
00:16:13,337 --> 00:16:14,338
[loud explosion]

576
00:16:14,338 --> 00:16:16,106
>> [coughing]

577
00:16:16,106 --> 00:16:20,110
>> ELVIS HAS LEFT THE BUILDING.

578
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,111
NOW, THESE ARE SOME

579
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:23,780
SIGNAL FLAGS.

580
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,115
I THINK YOU CAN GET MORE

581
00:16:25,115 --> 00:16:26,116
SIGNALING OUT OF WHAT'S COMING

582
00:16:26,116 --> 00:16:27,184
OFF HIS UNDERARMS THEN YOU DO

583
00:16:27,184 --> 00:16:29,453
OUT OF THE FLAGS.

584
00:16:29,453 --> 00:16:30,554
BILL'S A KIND OF UNUSUAL

585
00:16:30,554 --> 00:16:33,223
HUMAN BEING, ISN'T HE?

586
00:16:33,223 --> 00:16:34,558
HE CAN ALMOST FLY,

587
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:35,592
I WOULD THINK.

588
00:16:35,592 --> 00:16:36,994
HIS HEAD IS LIGHT ENOUGH.

589
00:16:36,994 --> 00:16:37,828
OH, OH, OH, OH, OH.

590
00:16:37,828 --> 00:16:38,495
THERE THEY GO.

591
00:16:38,495 --> 00:16:39,329
LOOK OUT, LOOK OUT, LOOK OUT,

592
00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:40,831
LOOK OUT.

593
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:42,733
WELL, SERVES HIM RIGHT.

594
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:43,734
AND THEN HE HAD SOMETHING.

595
00:16:43,734 --> 00:16:44,568
I KIND OF LIKE THIS.

596
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:45,902
THIS IS A SIGNAL KITE.

597
00:16:45,902 --> 00:16:47,270
YOU PUT "S.O.S." ON IT, AND THEN

598
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,605
YOU SEND IT UP, AND I GUESS A

599
00:16:48,605 --> 00:16:50,207
PLANE FLYING OVER OR MAYBE

600
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:51,208
SOMEBODY LOOKING UP INTO THE SKY

601
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,209
SEEN IT KNOWS THAT, YOU KNOW,

602
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:53,210
AT THE OTHER END OF THE STRING,

603
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,378
THERE'S SOMEBODY IN TROUBLE.

604
00:16:54,378 --> 00:16:56,046
BOY, IS THAT EVER TRUE.

605
00:16:56,046 --> 00:16:57,314
SO HE GOT HER UP THERE, FLYING

606
00:16:57,314 --> 00:16:58,582
UP THERE PRETTY GOOD, AND

607
00:16:58,582 --> 00:17:00,417
SHE WAS GOING UP AT LEAST

608
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:02,419
1,000, 2,000 FEET, AND ALL OF A

609
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:05,088
SUDDEN, WE GOT A SNAG, AND THE

610
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:06,123
DARN THING HAD WRAPPED ITSELF

611
00:17:06,123 --> 00:17:08,024
AROUND THE HYDRO WIRE.

612
00:17:08,024 --> 00:17:09,025
ANYWAY, YOU KNOW--

613
00:17:09,025 --> 00:17:11,128
OH, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, BILL.

614
00:17:11,128 --> 00:17:12,462
THE IDEA WAS--HERE'S ANOTHER

615
00:17:12,462 --> 00:17:13,296
METHOD OF SIGNALING.

616
00:17:13,296 --> 00:17:13,964
THIS IS A GUN.

617
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:15,632
YOU SHOOT FOUR SHOTS IN THE AIR.

618
00:17:15,632 --> 00:17:17,634
IT'S A UNIVERSAL SIGNAL.

619
00:17:17,634 --> 00:17:18,768
WHAT WE DIDN'T REALIZE WAS HE

620
00:17:18,768 --> 00:17:20,403
WAS SHOOTING RIGHT AT THE HYDRO

621
00:17:20,403 --> 00:17:22,105
WIRE THAT HAD THE KITE ON IT.

622
00:17:22,105 --> 00:17:24,207
DOWN SHE COMES, AND THERE'S

623
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:25,542
ABOUT 10,000 VOLTS THERE.

624
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:28,478
OH, OH, OH, OH, OW, OH, OH, OH,

625
00:17:28,478 --> 00:17:30,814
OW, OH, OH, BY GOLLY.

626
00:17:30,814 --> 00:17:31,948
NOW, HERE'S ONE THAT WE KIND OF

627
00:17:31,948 --> 00:17:33,450
STOLE FROM THE INDIANS, USING

628
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,785
THE BLANKET TO SIGNAL WITH AND

629
00:17:35,785 --> 00:17:36,987
THE PROBLEM HERE IS BILL DIDN'T

630
00:17:36,987 --> 00:17:37,921
REMEMBER WHERE THE BROKEN GLASS

631
00:17:37,921 --> 00:17:39,422
WAS.

632
00:17:39,422 --> 00:17:40,924
IT'S RIGHT THERE, BILL.

633
00:17:40,924 --> 00:17:41,591
>> [yelling]

634
00:17:41,591 --> 00:17:43,426
>> YEAH, YEAH, OH, BOY, OH, BOY.

635
00:17:43,426 --> 00:17:44,461
BUT I HAD SOME VICE GRIPS WITH

636
00:17:44,461 --> 00:17:46,029
ME, SO WE GO THAT OUT OF THERE.

637
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:47,697
OH, THIS WON'T HURT.

638
00:17:47,697 --> 00:17:48,932
OH.

639
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:49,799
SO I WENT AND GOT ANOTHER

640
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,334
BLANKET AND PUT THAT OVER THE

641
00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:52,335
FIRE, AND THE IDEA IS YOU LET

642
00:17:52,335 --> 00:17:53,303
THE BLANKET KIND OF SIT ON

643
00:17:53,303 --> 00:17:54,804
THERE, LET THE SMOKE BUILD UP,

644
00:17:54,804 --> 00:17:56,539
SO THAT WHEN YOU RELEASE IT, YOU

645
00:17:56,539 --> 00:17:57,407
KNOW IT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU REAL

646
00:17:57,407 --> 00:17:59,042
GOOD PUFFS THAT'LL GO WAY UP

647
00:17:59,042 --> 00:17:59,943
INTO THE AIR.

648
00:17:59,943 --> 00:18:03,446
SO WE FLIP HER OFF, AND, WELL,

649
00:18:03,446 --> 00:18:04,614
IT WASN'T REAL SUCCESSFUL.

650
00:18:04,614 --> 00:18:05,749
OF COURSE, THIS IS BECAUSE THE

651
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:09,052
FIRE WAS PRETTY WELL DEAD OUT.

652
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:10,387
SO WE GOT ANOTHER FIRE GOING,

653
00:18:10,387 --> 00:18:11,321
AND A REAL GOOD ONE GOING THIS

654
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:12,455
TIME AND GOT ANOTHER BLANKET

655
00:18:12,455 --> 00:18:14,257
AND THREW THAT ON THERE.

656
00:18:14,257 --> 00:18:16,493
AND AGAIN, YOU LET IT KIND OF

657
00:18:16,493 --> 00:18:19,929
BUILD UP UNDERNEATH.

658
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:21,731
MAYBE WE GOT THE FIRE JUST A TAD

659
00:18:21,731 --> 00:18:22,666
ON THE WARM SIDE.

660
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:23,767
MAYBE WHAT WE NEED IS MORE SMOKE

661
00:18:23,767 --> 00:18:24,434
AND MAYBE--

662
00:18:24,434 --> 00:18:27,771
OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH.

663
00:18:27,771 --> 00:18:28,972
BOY, IT'S A GOOD THING BILL

664
00:18:28,972 --> 00:18:29,706
KNOWS WHAT TO DO IN AN

665
00:18:29,706 --> 00:18:30,707
EMERGENCY, 'CAUSE HE CAUSES A

666
00:18:30,707 --> 00:18:32,676
HELL OF A LOT OF 'EM.

667
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,279
"IT IS WINTER.

668
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:38,048
A TIME FOR QUIET WALKS AND

669
00:18:38,048 --> 00:18:40,316
PEACEFUL THOUGHTS, TO STARE

670
00:18:40,316 --> 00:18:42,352
BLANKLY AT THE GENTLE SNOWFLAKES

671
00:18:42,352 --> 00:18:43,787
AS THEY FALL THROUGH THE NAKED

672
00:18:43,787 --> 00:18:46,456
TREES AND THEN TO SLIP AND BANG

673
00:18:46,456 --> 00:18:48,425
YOUR HEAD ON THE LAKE."

674
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,468
SAW A MOVIE FROM THE VIDEO STORE

675
00:18:58,468 --> 00:18:59,302
THE OTHER DAY.

676
00:18:59,302 --> 00:19:00,303
>> OH, GOOD ONE?

677
00:19:00,303 --> 00:19:01,604
>> WELL, IT WAS GREAT.

678
00:19:01,604 --> 00:19:03,239
IT WAS A TIME-TRAVELING THING.

679
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:04,407
THEY HAD A PHONE BOOTH, AND THE

680
00:19:04,407 --> 00:19:05,408
GUYS WOULD GET IN, AND THE PHONE

681
00:19:05,408 --> 00:19:06,309
BOOTH, THEY COULD TRAVEL TO A

682
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:07,310
DIFFERENT TIME.

683
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,812
>> OH, THAT SOUNDS EXCELLENT.

684
00:19:08,812 --> 00:19:09,646
>> YEAH, YOU EVER THOUGHT OF

685
00:19:09,646 --> 00:19:10,313
THAT?

686
00:19:10,313 --> 00:19:11,314
>> OH, GETTING IN A PHONE BOOTH

687
00:19:11,314 --> 00:19:12,282
AND JUST TRAVELING.

688
00:19:12,282 --> 00:19:13,149
>> YEAH.

689
00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:14,184
YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAD A TIME

690
00:19:14,184 --> 00:19:16,019
MACHINE, WHAT IF YOU GOT IN IT,

691
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:17,687
AND YOU WENT, LIKE,

692
00:19:17,687 --> 00:19:19,222
10 MILLION YEARS AND CAME RIGHT

693
00:19:19,222 --> 00:19:20,256
BACK TO WHEN YOU WERE RIGHT NOW.

694
00:19:20,256 --> 00:19:21,424
WOULD IT BE RIGHT NOW OR WOULD

695
00:19:21,424 --> 00:19:23,259
IT BE A DIFFERENT NOW?

696
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:24,928
OR WOULD IT BE CLOSE

697
00:19:24,928 --> 00:19:25,595
TO THE SAME NOW?

698
00:19:25,595 --> 00:19:26,696
>> IT WOULD BE REALLY CLOSE TO

699
00:19:26,696 --> 00:19:27,363
THE SAME NOW.

700
00:19:27,363 --> 00:19:28,031
>> HOW CLOSE?

701
00:19:28,031 --> 00:19:28,865
>> REALLY CLOSE, BUT ONLY

702
00:19:28,865 --> 00:19:30,633
DIFFERENT.

703
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:31,968
WHAT TIME WOULD YOU GO TO

704
00:19:31,968 --> 00:19:33,236
IF YOU COULD TIME TRAVEL?

705
00:19:33,236 --> 00:19:35,171
>> I'D GO TO AROUND 7:30.

706
00:19:35,171 --> 00:19:36,005
>> TODAY?

707
00:19:36,005 --> 00:19:37,840
LIKE, THE FUTURE OR YESTERDAY

708
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,675
OR THIS MORNING?

709
00:19:38,675 --> 00:19:39,509
THERE'S SO MANY.

710
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:40,310
>> I'D HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT.

711
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,977
>> YOU'D HAVE TO.

712
00:19:40,977 --> 00:19:41,978
YOU HAVE TO BE SPECIFIC.

713
00:19:41,978 --> 00:19:43,646
>> YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW, TIME

714
00:19:43,646 --> 00:19:44,781
FLIES WHEN YOU'RE HAVING FUN,

715
00:19:44,781 --> 00:19:47,717
OR AS WE SAY, "TIME IS FUN WHEN

716
00:19:47,717 --> 00:19:48,885
YOU'RE HAVING FLIES."

717
00:19:48,885 --> 00:19:50,053
GET IT?

718
00:19:50,053 --> 00:19:53,389
>> OH, IT'S A BAIT JOKE.

719
00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:55,124
>> I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO ANY

720
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:56,626
OF THE FARMERS WHO I MAY HAVE

721
00:19:56,626 --> 00:19:58,895
OFFENDED, AND IF YOU'LL FORGIVE

722
00:19:58,895 --> 00:20:00,597
ME, I'LL TELL YOU THE REST OF

723
00:20:00,597 --> 00:20:02,398
THE WATERSLIDE STORY.

724
00:20:02,398 --> 00:20:03,833
>> DON'T GO FOR IT.

725
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,935
IT'S A TRICK.

726
00:20:05,935 --> 00:20:07,170
>> ONE'S STILL KIND OF JAMMED

727
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,204
UNDER THERE.

728
00:20:08,204 --> 00:20:08,972
>> WELL, THAT'S ONE OF THEM

729
00:20:08,972 --> 00:20:09,739
SMALL ONES.

730
00:20:09,739 --> 00:20:10,473
I THINK THEY CALL THEM

731
00:20:10,473 --> 00:20:11,441
A "THREE SERIES."

732
00:20:11,441 --> 00:20:12,108
>> YEAH.

733
00:20:12,108 --> 00:20:13,042
>> YEAH, THEY'RE JUST

734
00:20:13,042 --> 00:20:13,876
A FOUR-CYLINDER.

735
00:20:13,876 --> 00:20:14,711
>> KIND OF SPORTY-LOOKING,

736
00:20:14,711 --> 00:20:15,378
THOUGH.

737
00:20:15,378 --> 00:20:16,045
>> THEY ARE.

738
00:20:16,045 --> 00:20:17,947
THEY COME WITH--APPARENTLY, YOU

739
00:20:17,947 --> 00:20:19,015
CAN GET REAL LEATHER UPHOLSTERY

740
00:20:19,015 --> 00:20:21,217
IN THAT MODEL, ALTHOUGH IF YOU

741
00:20:21,217 --> 00:20:22,485
LOOK AT IT, THE GLOVE

742
00:20:22,485 --> 00:20:24,587
COMPARTMENT IS STILL SHUT.

743
00:20:24,587 --> 00:20:25,288
>> PERFECT.

744
00:20:25,288 --> 00:20:26,289
>> YEAH, I THINK THE MANUAL AND

745
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:27,223
EVERYTHING IS RIGHT IN THERE

746
00:20:27,223 --> 00:20:28,224
LIKE IT WAS BRAND-NEW.

747
00:20:28,224 --> 00:20:29,258
>> I THINK THE KEYS ARE IN IT,

748
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:30,259
DOUGIE.

749
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:31,461
>> OH, I DOUBT SHE'LL TURN OVER

750
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:33,429
ON YOU THERE, RED.

751
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,569
>> I KNOW WE GOT A LOT OF YOUNG

752
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:41,404
PEOPLE WATCHING OUR SHOW AS SOME

753
00:20:41,404 --> 00:20:44,173
SORT OF A PUNISHMENT, AND I KNOW

754
00:20:44,173 --> 00:20:45,708
HAROLD GETS THE CHANCE TO TALK

755
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,009
TO YOU, BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S

756
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:48,578
MORE OF A CONTRACTUAL THING

757
00:20:48,578 --> 00:20:50,580
THAT HE INSISTED ON RATHER

758
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,447
THAN A SEGMENT THAT HAS ANY

759
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:53,282
REAL VALUE TO IT.

760
00:20:53,282 --> 00:20:54,817
AND NOW, TO MY MIND, YOU NEED

761
00:20:54,817 --> 00:20:56,185
SOMEONE A LITTLE OLDER, SOMEONE

762
00:20:56,185 --> 00:20:57,587
MAYBE WHO'S BEEN DOWN THE ROAD

763
00:20:57,587 --> 00:20:59,021
A TIME OR TWO TO GIVE YOU

764
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:00,056
YOUNG PEOPLE SOME ADVICE

765
00:21:00,056 --> 00:21:01,557
ON GROWING UP.

766
00:21:01,557 --> 00:21:03,926
LIKE, MAYBE YOU JUST TURNED 16

767
00:21:03,926 --> 00:21:04,961
AND YOU GOT YOUR DRIVER'S

768
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:06,696
LICENSE AND YOU'RE EXCITED AS

769
00:21:06,696 --> 00:21:08,531
HECK ABOUT THAT, AND NEXT THING

770
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:10,967
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE STOLEN A CAR.

771
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:11,767
AND OF COURSE, YOU WANT TO GO

772
00:21:11,767 --> 00:21:12,735
DOWN TO THE HIGH SCHOOL AND

773
00:21:12,735 --> 00:21:14,470
START SHOWING OFF, DOING THE

774
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,905
DOUGHNUTS AND THE FIGURE EIGHTS

775
00:21:15,905 --> 00:21:17,640
IN THE FLOWERBEDS THERE, AND

776
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,475
THEN GET UP ONTO THE TWO WHEELS

777
00:21:19,475 --> 00:21:20,810
AND THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR

778
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:21,978
OF THE SCHOOL SO YOU CAN PEEL

779
00:21:21,978 --> 00:21:24,180
RUBBER UP AND DOWN THE HALLS.

780
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,615
I KNOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF

781
00:21:25,615 --> 00:21:28,618
FUN, BUT PLEASE, PLAY IT SMART.

782
00:21:28,618 --> 00:21:29,952
WEAR YOUR SEATBELT.

783
00:21:29,952 --> 00:21:32,922
[laughter]

784
00:21:37,827 --> 00:21:39,595
SO ANYWAY, YOU GOT TO PICTURE

785
00:21:39,595 --> 00:21:41,030
THIS WATERSLIDE WITH ALL THE

786
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,032
TROUGHS DUCT-TAPED TOGETHER,

787
00:21:43,032 --> 00:21:44,367
RUNNING FROM THE CHIMNEY

788
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:45,568
ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE LAKE.

789
00:21:45,568 --> 00:21:46,836
AND WE WERE ALL PRETTY EXCITED

790
00:21:46,836 --> 00:21:47,503
ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW.

791
00:21:47,503 --> 00:21:48,504
SO MOOSE THOMPSON,

792
00:21:48,504 --> 00:21:49,405
HE WAS REAL RARED UP.

793
00:21:49,405 --> 00:21:50,673
HE STRIPPED DOWN TO HIS

794
00:21:50,673 --> 00:21:52,875
UNDERWEAR AND AWAY HE GOES

795
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,176
BEFORE WE'D ACTUALLY HAD A

796
00:21:54,176 --> 00:21:55,745
CHANCE TO PUT ANY WATER ON IT,

797
00:21:55,745 --> 00:21:57,246
YOU KNOW?

798
00:21:57,246 --> 00:21:58,614
I MEAN, ALL YOU COULD HEAR WAS

799
00:21:58,614 --> 00:22:00,049
THE SQUEALING SOUND OF MOOSE'S

800
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:01,484
SKIN COMING OFF, YOU KNOW?

801
00:22:01,484 --> 00:22:03,819
OF COURSE, THE REST OF US LAUGH,

802
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:06,088
AND WITH MOOSE GOING FIRST,

803
00:22:06,088 --> 00:22:07,289
HE SOON REALIZED THAT

804
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:09,025
THE WATERSLIDE WENT ALMOST

805
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:10,493
TO THE WATER BUT, YOU KNOW,

806
00:22:10,493 --> 00:22:11,827
NOT QUITE.

807
00:22:11,827 --> 00:22:13,462
SO WE PUT ANOTHER TROUGH ON THE

808
00:22:13,462 --> 00:22:15,364
END THERE, AND WE CALLED 911 FOR

809
00:22:15,364 --> 00:22:17,700
MOOSE, AND THEN BUSTER AND

810
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,868
STINKY, YOU KNOW, HAD A COUPLE

811
00:22:18,868 --> 00:22:19,835
OF GOOD RUNS ON IT, BECAUSE WE

812
00:22:19,835 --> 00:22:21,537
HAD THE WATER GOING BY THEN, BUT

813
00:22:21,537 --> 00:22:22,571
IT WASN'T FAST ENOUGH FOR OLD

814
00:22:22,571 --> 00:22:23,572
MAN SEDGEWICK.

815
00:22:23,572 --> 00:22:25,241
SO HE TOOK OFF ALL HIS CLOTHES,

816
00:22:25,241 --> 00:22:26,842
SKIVVIES AND THE WHOLE DEAL, AND

817
00:22:26,842 --> 00:22:28,644
COVERED HIMSELF WITH SALAD OIL,

818
00:22:28,644 --> 00:22:29,311
RIGHT?

819
00:22:29,311 --> 00:22:30,046
WELL, WE WERE OUT OF FRENCH

820
00:22:30,046 --> 00:22:33,649
DRESSING, AND SO, I MEAN, HE WAS

821
00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:36,318
REALLY WHIPPING DOWN THERE, AND

822
00:22:36,318 --> 00:22:38,354
ABOUT 2/3 OF THE WAY DOWN, WE

823
00:22:38,354 --> 00:22:39,688
HEARD WHAT WE HOPED WAS THE

824
00:22:39,688 --> 00:22:40,556
SOUND OF HIM BREAKING THE SOUND

825
00:22:40,556 --> 00:22:41,657
BARRIER.

826
00:22:41,657 --> 00:22:43,893
AND HE COMES OUT THE END OF THE

827
00:22:43,893 --> 00:22:45,795
WATERSLIDE, SKIPS FOUR TIMES

828
00:22:45,795 --> 00:22:47,263
ACROSS THE LAKE, AND LANDS IN

829
00:22:47,263 --> 00:22:47,997
THE BONFIRE AT THE AT THE

830
00:22:47,997 --> 00:22:49,965
GIRL GUIDE'S CAMP.

831
00:22:49,965 --> 00:22:51,433
BUT THEN HE ALWAYS MAKES A BAD

832
00:22:51,433 --> 00:22:53,602
FIRST IMPRESSION ANYWAY.

833
00:22:53,602 --> 00:22:55,171
WE ALL DECIDED, THOUGH, THAT THE

834
00:22:55,171 --> 00:22:56,438
WATERSLIDE WAS TOO DANGEROUS,

835
00:22:56,438 --> 00:22:57,540
AND, AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT,

836
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,474
A MINUTE LATER, IT COLLAPSED

837
00:22:58,474 --> 00:22:59,608
ANYWAY.

838
00:22:59,608 --> 00:23:01,510
SO LIVE AND LEARN.

839
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,345
OR JUST LIVE, YOU KNOW?

840
00:23:03,345 --> 00:23:05,281
ANYWAY, IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

841
00:23:05,281 --> 00:23:06,448
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME

842
00:23:06,448 --> 00:23:07,816
TONIGHT, AND I WOULDN'T MIND

843
00:23:07,816 --> 00:23:08,717
A BACK SCRATCH IF YOU'RE NOT
