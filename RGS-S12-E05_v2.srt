SO THAT SHE'LL KNOW
THAT YOU CARE FOR HER,

156
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,445
BUT IF YOU GIVE HER
TOO SPECIAL A GIFT,

157
00:06:53,512 --> 00:06:54,880
THEN SHE'S GONNA THINK
YOU'RE COVERING UP

158
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:57,115
FOR SOMETHING YOU DID WRONG.

159
00:06:57,149 --> 00:07:00,085
NO! NO! NO!
NO, I DISAGREE
WITH THAT APPROACH.

160
00:07:00,152 --> 00:07:02,554
NO, IF YOU'RE IN A TRUSTING,
HONEST RELATIONSHIP,

161
00:07:02,587 --> 00:07:05,290
YOU CAN BE GENEROUS
WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES.

162
00:07:05,357 --> 00:07:07,926
HAROLD, HAROLD, IF
YOU'RE IN ANY KIND
OF RELATIONSHIP,

163
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,198
YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING
WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES.

164
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:15,934
I HATE
CONSEQUENCES.

165
00:07:17,602 --> 00:07:20,105
OKAY, WELL, I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO APOLOGIZE TO
THIS MAN WHO WROTE IN,

166
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:22,874
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T
AGREE ON ANYTHING.

167
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:27,446
SO MY SUGGESTION IS JUST
FOLLOW WITH YOUR OWN HEART.

168
00:07:27,512 --> 00:07:28,714
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

169
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,349
YOU KNOW, I THINK IF I
WAS MARRIED TO YOU GUYS,

170
00:07:30,382 --> 00:07:33,185
I'D KILL MYSELF.

171
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:35,287
HAROLD,
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO.

172
00:07:39,524 --> 00:07:41,159
CHOOSING THE
RIGHT PARKING SPOT

173
00:07:41,193 --> 00:07:42,661
IS A FINE ART, ISN'T IT?

174
00:07:42,694 --> 00:07:44,763
OH, I KNOW THEY TEACH
FINE ART IN UNIVERSITY,

175
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,666
BUT THIS IS THE KIND
YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE.

176
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:49,868
NOW, THE MAIN ITEM YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR HERE

177
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:51,169
IS SHADE.

178
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:53,238
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP YOUR
CAR AS COOL AS POSSIBLE,

179
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:55,140
ESPECIALLY IF YOU
HAVE VINYL SEATS.

180
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:57,075
EVEN MORE SO IF YOU
HAVE BLACK VINYL SEATS

181
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:58,477
AND YOU'RE WEARING
A BATHING SUIT,

182
00:07:58,543 --> 00:08:01,613
BECAUSE SKIN GRAFTS
CAN BE VERY EXPENSIVE.

183
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,850
BUT YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T ALWAYS
FIND A SPOT UNDER A TREE.

184
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:07,152
SO TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU
HOW TO PROTECT YOUR VEHICLE

185
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:10,789
WITH SOMETHING I LIKE
TO CALL PORTABLE SHADE.

186
00:08:10,822 --> 00:08:14,159
OKAY, I'M GONNA START WITH A
COUPLE OF THESE RETRACTABLE
TAPE MEASURES.

187
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:15,460
OH, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING...

188
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:17,395
HEY, IF THIS INVOLVES
ACCURATE MEASUREMENT,

189
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:19,030
COUNT ME OUT.

190
00:08:19,097 --> 00:08:20,999
[ chuckling ]
ACCURATE MEASUREMENT.

191
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:23,535
I'LL HAVE TO
REMEMBER THAT ONE.

192
00:08:23,602 --> 00:08:27,639
NO, NO, WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING
TO USE THESE AS SIMPLE
MOUNTING UNITS.

193
00:08:27,706 --> 00:08:30,909
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS TO
MOUNT YOUR TAPE MEASURES
ONTO YOUR VEHICLE

194
00:08:30,976 --> 00:08:33,745
JUST ABOVE AND IN
FRONT OF THE HOOD.

195
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:35,847
AND YOU CAN USE WHATEVER
FASTENING DEVICES

196
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:38,883
BEST SUITS THE LOOK
AND STYLE OF YOUR CAR.

197
00:08:43,021 --> 00:08:45,557
OKAY, NOW, I'VE ATTACHED A
COUPLE OF OLD DRAPERY RODS

198
00:08:45,624 --> 00:08:47,592
TO THE TOP OF
THE TAPE MEASURES.

199
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:49,761
I LIKE USING THEM
BECAUSE THEY'RE FLEXIBLE,

200
00:08:49,828 --> 00:08:53,798
BUT THEY'RE STIFF ENOUGH TO
STAY AN INCH OR SO ABOVE
THE BODY OF THE CAR.

201
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:55,467
SEE, THAT ALLOWS
FOR AIR FLOW.

202
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:58,803
WHEN YOU GET TO MY AGE,
AIR FLOW IS CRUCIAL.

203
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,705
BY THE WAY, DON'T LET YOUR
WIFE CATCH YOU DOING THIS

204
00:09:00,772 --> 00:09:02,374
WITH HER BRAND NEW
DRAPERY RODS,

205
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,743
OR IT'LL BE
CURTAINS FOR YOU.

206
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:08,647
OKAY, NOW WE ATTACH THE OTHER
ENDS OF THE DRAPERY RODS

207
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:10,248
TO THIS LUGGAGE RACK.

208
00:09:10,281 --> 00:09:11,750
IF YOU DON'T
HAVE A LUGGAGE RACK,

209
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:13,985
YOU CAN TAKE ONE OFF
OF ANY BRITISH CAR.

210
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:15,754
THEY USE 'EM TO
CARRY BICYCLES AROUND

211
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,355
BECAUSE THEY'RE
CARS ARE SO USELESS,

212
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:19,424
YOU REALLY GOTTA
HAVE A BACKUP PLAN.

213
00:09:19,491 --> 00:09:23,361
OKAY, SO NOW ALL
WE NEED IS OUR SHADE.

214
00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:26,197
NOW, YOU COULD GO WITH CLOTH
DRAPES OR SHEET METAL

215
00:09:26,264 --> 00:09:28,867
OR ONE OF ARETHA
FRANKLIN'S DRESSES,

216
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,670
BUT I PREFER TO USE SOMETHING
WATERPROOF AND LESS EXPENSIVE.

217
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:35,540
THAT'S RIGHT,
SHOWER CURTAINS.

218
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:37,041
I HAD TO TRIM THESE
BABIES OFF A LITTLE BIT,

219
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:40,478
BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO LONG
FOR THE WIDTH OF THE CAR.

220
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:43,515
AND I ADDED RING HOLES
TO THE BOTTOM EDGE THERE

221
00:09:43,581 --> 00:09:46,117
SO THAT BOTH SIDES OF
THE CURTAIN WILL BE
DRAWN UP EVENLY

222
00:09:46,151 --> 00:09:47,786
OVER THE CAR.

223
00:09:47,819 --> 00:09:49,454
I GUESS YOU COULD
CALL THIS VEHICLE

224
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:51,856
FORD OF THE RINGS.

225
00:09:51,923 --> 00:09:53,591
[ NO AUDIO ]

226
00:09:55,493 --> 00:09:57,228
OKAY, NOW, TO
AUTOMATE THE UNIT,

227
00:09:57,295 --> 00:10:00,131
WELL, THAT'S WHERE MY TAPE
MEASURES COME BACK INTO PLAY.

228
00:10:00,198 --> 00:10:02,100
I PULL OUT THE
TAPE ON BOTH SIDES,

229
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:03,601
THEN ATTACH
THE ENDS OF THE TAPES

230
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:06,271
TO THE FRONT EDGE
OF MY CURTAIN.

231
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:10,341
THEN ALL'S I GOTTA DO IS
LOCK THE RECOIL SWITCH
ON EACH OF 'EM,

232
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,277
AND WE'RE READY
FOR A ROAD TEST.

233
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,088
WHO CARES ABOUT THE SUN?

234
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:26,724
BECAUSE NOW WHEN I PARK
AND PULL ON THE HOOD RELEASE,

235
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,893
I GOT IT MADE IN THE SHADE.

236
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:36,367
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

237
00:10:36,434 --> 00:10:37,902
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HAND --

238
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:39,304
OH, YEAH, ONE MORE THING.

239
00:10:39,337 --> 00:10:41,039
IF YOU WANNA PROTECT
YOUR DOORS AS WELL,

240
00:10:41,105 --> 00:10:46,144
GO BACK TO THE TUB,
GET THE BATH MAT OUT OF THERE.

241
00:10:46,477 --> 00:10:48,313
NO ONLY GREAT
PROTECTION FROM THE SUN,

242
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:49,614
BUT ALSO FROM
THOSE IDIOTS

243
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:51,416
WHO DING YOU WHEN
THEY PARK TOO CLOSE.

244
00:10:56,721 --> 00:11:00,258
[ APPLAUSE ]

245
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,302
YOU KNOW, THERE COMES A TIME
IN THE LIVES OF MOST MEN

246
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:13,871
WHEN YOU REALISE YOU'VE TAKEN
BETTER CARE OF YOUR CARS

247
00:11:13,938 --> 00:11:16,107
THAN YOU HAVE OF
YOUR OWN BODY.

248
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,742
HECK, YOU'VE TAKEN
BETTER CARE OF RENTAL CARS

249
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:19,510
THAN YOUR OWN BODY.

250
00:11:19,544 --> 00:11:21,412
AND IT'S NOT A
RENTAL, IS IT, HUH?

251
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:22,980
YOU CAN'T JUST DITCH
YOUR BODY IN THE WOODS

252
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:25,783
AND THEN REPORT IT STOLEN.

253
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,752
ARE YOU ONE OF THOSE GUYS?

254
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:31,889
IS THERE A CHANCE YOU HAVEN'T
KEPT YOURSELF IN SHOWROOM
CONDITION?

255
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:33,491
EASY WAY TO FIND OUT.

256
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:35,093
STAND IN FRONT OF
THE BATHROOM MIRROR.

257
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,494
DON'T ACTUALLY
LOOK IN THE MIRROR.

258
00:11:36,561 --> 00:11:38,262
YOU AREN'T READY
FOR THAT YET.

259
00:11:38,296 --> 00:11:40,498
I'M JUST SAYING OPEN UP
THE MEDICINE CABINET,

260
00:11:40,565 --> 00:11:42,633
TAKE A LOOK AT
WHAT'S INSIDE THERE.

261
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:44,202
REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG
YOU'VE HAVE NOTHING IN THERE

262
00:11:44,268 --> 00:11:46,070
EXCEPT MAYBE A TUBE
OF TOOTHPASTE,

263
00:11:46,137 --> 00:11:48,406
BOTTLE OF MOUTHWASH, EH?

264
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:50,107
NOW WHAT DO YOU GOT?

265
00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:53,311
ANTIHISTAMINES,
ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES,

266
00:11:53,344 --> 00:11:55,379
ANTI-DIARRHEA STUFF,

267
00:11:55,413 --> 00:11:59,550
ANTI-DEPRESSANTS, IN CASE
THE ANTI-DIARRHEA STUFF
DOESN'T WORK?

268
00:11:59,884 --> 00:12:03,354
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN YOUR
MEDICINE CABINET WAS
PRACTICALLY EMPTY.

269
00:12:03,387 --> 00:12:06,290
NOW YOU ALMOST
NEED TO BUILD ON

270
00:12:06,357 --> 00:12:08,793
BECAUSE YOU GOT TUBES AND
BOTTLES ALL OVER THE
SINK COUNTER

271
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,762
ACROSS THE TOP
OF THE TOILET TANK,

272
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:15,132
ON EVERY HORIZONTAL SURFACE
IN THE WHOLE BATHROOM.

273
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:18,336
YOU MAY ACTUALLY NEED
A WALK-IN MEDICINE CABINET.

274
00:12:19,971 --> 00:12:22,673
THAT'S BECAUSE YOUR LIFE HAS
REACHED THE HALFWAY POINT

275
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,178
BETWEEN PIMPLE CREAM
AND LIVER SPOT REMOVER.

276
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:30,548
SEE, THIS IS WHEN MEN NEED
THOSE MEDICINES THE MOST

277
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:32,650
BECAUSE WHEN YOU
REALLY ARE OLD,

278
00:12:32,717 --> 00:12:35,219
EVERYTHING THAT THEY'RE
USED FOR IS DRIED UP,

279
00:12:35,252 --> 00:12:37,922
SHRIVELED AWAY,
HARDENED, SOFTENED,

280
00:12:37,989 --> 00:12:39,223
WRINKLED, CRINKLED,

281
00:12:39,256 --> 00:12:42,927
BLOWN OUT OR FALLEN OFF.

282
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,863
SO STOP COMPLAINING,
TAKE YOUR MEDICINE LIKE A MAN,

283
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,132
AND REMEMBER,
I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

284
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:49,834
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

285
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:52,136
[ APPLAUSE ]

286
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,509
I EMPTIED THE REST OF THE
RADIOACTIVE FERTILIZER

287
00:12:58,576 --> 00:13:01,612
ONTO THE SUNFLOWERS THERE.

288
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,016
YOU KNOW, NOW I GUESS THIS
IS A NUCLEAR EFFICIENT LODGE.

289
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,418
UNCLE RED!

290
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:09,053
THE SUNFLOWER SEEDS
ARE STILL GROWING.

291
00:13:09,086 --> 00:13:10,254
THEY'RE ALMOST
UP TO THE ROOF.

292
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:12,823
YEAH, I GAVE 'EM A LITTLE
BOOST THERE, HAROLD.

293
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,259
I THINK THE LODGE'LL BE
HIDDEN IN JUST A FEW
MINUTES NOW.

294
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:17,661
OLD MAN SEDGWICK
WILL NEVER FIND US.

295
00:13:17,728 --> 00:13:20,364
OH, YEAH!
[ chuckles ]

296
00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:22,266
THEY'RE PAST THE ROOF!
THEY'RE PAST THE ROOF!

297
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:24,568
THAT'S FINE.
THAT'S FINE.

298
00:13:24,602 --> 00:13:26,871
THEY'RE VERY CLOSE TO
THE POWER LINES, UNCLE RED.

299
00:13:26,904 --> 00:13:29,473
VERY CLOSE!

300
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,108
HAROLD, YOU WORRY
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

301
00:13:31,175 --> 00:13:32,643
[ mock fear ]
THEY'RE VERY CLOSE
TO THE POWER LINES.

302
00:13:32,676 --> 00:13:34,912
THESE FLOWERS ARE
SO SCARY, AREN'T THEY?

303
00:13:34,945 --> 00:13:37,848
WELL, I THINK SOMEONE
SHOULD TURN THE POWER
OFF TO THE LODGE!

304
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:39,450
OH, I WOULDN'T
BOTHER, HAROLD.

305
00:13:39,483 --> 00:13:41,552
WELL, THEN FINE.
I'LL DO IT MYSELF.

306
00:13:41,585 --> 00:13:43,654
WELL, SUIT YOURSELF.

307
00:13:43,954 --> 00:13:46,056
MAYBE THE BABY SHOULD
TAKE THE THUMB OUT
OF HIS MOUTH.

308
00:13:46,123 --> 00:13:47,758
OH!

309
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,760
[ shuddering ]

310
00:13:51,795 --> 00:13:54,231
I TOLD YOU NOT
BOTHER, HAROLD.

311
00:14:00,738 --> 00:14:02,106
Red (voice over):
IT WAS AN EXCITING
DAY FOR US ALL.

312
00:14:02,172 --> 00:14:05,242
WALTER WAS MOVING,
AND WE WERE HELPING HIM OUT.

313
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:09,680
WINSTON SHOWED UP WITH
ONE OF THE TRUCKS OF HIS
SEWAGE FLEET THERE.

314
00:14:09,747 --> 00:14:12,216
WE ASKED HIM NOT
TO BRING THE PUMPER.

315
00:14:12,283 --> 00:14:14,318
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT WINSTON BRINGS,

316
00:14:14,385 --> 00:14:18,255
IT'S GOT A CERTAIN
SOMETHING TO IT, YOU KNOW.

317
00:14:18,322 --> 00:14:20,224
LIKE, TO ME, I WOULD'VE
TAKEN THE HOSES OUT

318
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,026
BEFORE I BROUGHT IT OVER,

319
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:24,161
BUT THAT'S JUST WINSTON.

320
00:14:24,228 --> 00:14:25,529
SO WE GOT A FAIR
NUMBER OF BOX --

321
00:14:25,596 --> 00:14:28,265
WALTER TOOK A GOOD
LOAD, I THOUGHT.

322
00:14:28,332 --> 00:14:30,401
I MEAN, IT'S HIS STUFF.

323
00:14:30,467 --> 00:14:32,536
SO I GOT MINE IN TO
THE TRUCK THERE,

324
00:14:32,603 --> 00:14:34,672
AND I THOUGHT WALTER WOULD
JUST SLIDE HIS INTO MY LEFT,

325
00:14:34,705 --> 00:14:37,808
BUT HE WENT ANOTHER
WAY WITH IT.

326
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:41,612
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WALTER, IT'S REALLY --

327
00:14:41,645 --> 00:14:43,414
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
NO, THAT'S FINE.

328
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,916
YOU'RE GOOD.
YOU'RE GOOD.
YOU'RE GOOD.

329
00:14:45,983 --> 00:14:50,320
OH, AH, OH -- UH-OH!

330
00:14:50,654 --> 00:14:52,956
SO WALTER THROWS
HIS UP THERE,

331
00:14:53,023 --> 00:14:54,558
AND THEN -- LOOK.
HE'S VERY ATHLETIC.

332
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,060
LOOK AT THIS.

333
00:14:56,126 --> 00:14:57,461
AND THEN HE'S INVITING
US TO DO THE SAME.

334
00:14:57,528 --> 00:15:00,297
NOT GONNA HAPPEN,
I DON'T THINK.

335
00:15:00,364 --> 00:15:03,200
SO WE JUST START CASUALLY
THROWING THE BOXES.

336
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:07,571
LIKE I SAY,
HE'S PRETTY ATHLETIC.

337
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:13,077
WELL, MAYBE HE'S NOT
THAT ATHLETIC.

338
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,546
THEN YOU ALWAYS HAVE THAT
ONE HEAVY BIT WHEN
YOU'RE MOVING.

339
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:17,414
THIS DRESSER WEIGHED A LOT.

340
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:19,183
SO WINSTON GOT THE IDEA TO
TAKE THE DRAWERS OUT OF HER,

341
00:15:19,249 --> 00:15:20,284
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS GOOD,

342
00:15:20,317 --> 00:15:24,721
BUT DIDN'T REALLY
UNDERSTAND THE --

343
00:15:24,788 --> 00:15:27,591
I DON'T QUITE
SEE HOW THAT --

344
00:15:27,658 --> 00:15:29,359
BUT WINSTON SAYS, NO, NO.

345
00:15:29,393 --> 00:15:32,129
WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO IS USE
THE ROPE OFF THE FLAGPOLE.

346
00:15:32,196 --> 00:15:35,499
IF I CAN JUST TIE THAT AROUND
THE DRAWERS AND DRESSER,

347
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:37,634
THEN WE CAN USE
LIKE A PENDULUM DEAL,

348
00:15:37,668 --> 00:15:39,303
AND INSTEAD OF LIFTING
IT ONTO THE TRUCK,

349
00:15:39,369 --> 00:15:40,871
WE'LL JUST HOIST HER UP,

350
00:15:40,904 --> 00:15:43,240
AND WE'LL JUST SWING HER
ONE THERE, YOU KNOW?

351
00:15:43,307 --> 00:15:44,575
BRING HER IN.

352
00:15:44,608 --> 00:15:47,211
AND THEN IF WE JUST TIE
THAT OFF ON THE FLAGPOLE,

353
00:15:47,244 --> 00:15:50,848
AND THEN WE CAN DO
LIKE A AN UP AND OVER

354
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:52,382
OR AN EASY GOER
OR A UNDER ROUNDER

355
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,251
OR WHATEVER THE
HECK THEY CALL IT.

356
00:15:54,284 --> 00:15:55,719
NOW, WATCH THIS.

357
00:15:55,786 --> 00:15:57,120
NOW, YOU CATCH THIS, WALTER.

358
00:15:57,154 --> 00:15:59,122
HERE SHE COMES.
HERE SHE COMES.

359
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:01,225
OH!

360
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:06,496
OKAY, JUST --
I'M SURE IT WASN'T THAT
EXPENSIVE AN HEIRLOOM.

361
00:16:06,797 --> 00:16:09,132
NOW, WE'VE GOT JUST
A LITTLE BIT OF ROOM LEFT

362
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,101
AND WE'VE GOT ALL THIS STUFF
WE'VE GOTTA FIGURE OUT --

363
00:16:11,168 --> 00:16:12,436
SO WINSTON'S GOT THE IDEA

364
00:16:12,469 --> 00:16:15,105
WHAT WE GOTTA DO IS GET
EVERYTHING INTO THE ONE BOX.

365
00:16:15,138 --> 00:16:18,709
SO I DUMP THIS
BOX IN THERE.

366
00:16:18,742 --> 00:16:20,344
BUT TO ME THERE
SEEMS TO BE --

367
00:16:20,377 --> 00:16:22,479
THIS IS LIKE PACKING A TRUNK
WHEN YOU'RE GOING AWAY
ON HOLIDAYS.

368
00:16:22,546 --> 00:16:24,581
IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
YOU CAN GET EVERYTHING IN.

369
00:16:24,648 --> 00:16:29,186
YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE I GUESS
THEY'RE BETTER PACKERS.

370
00:16:29,252 --> 00:16:30,988
LIKE I TRIED TO
GET THAT GOLF BAG IN.

371
00:16:31,021 --> 00:16:32,589
IT JUST WOULD NOT GO.

372
00:16:32,656 --> 00:16:35,592
BUT WINSTON GRABS HER,
AND HE HAS AN EYE.

373
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:39,629
HE JUST JUST FLIPS HER OVER
AND THERE YOU GO.

374
00:16:39,696 --> 00:16:42,833
SO WE GET EVERYTHING
EXCEPT THE PULL-OUT SOFABED.

375
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:44,534
AND THAT WAS
A PITCH FORK.

376
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:48,605
WE DIDN'T REALISE
THESE THINGS SPRING OUT.

377
00:16:48,638 --> 00:16:51,508
OH!
OH, YOU'RE FINE.

378
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:53,543
SO WE THINK IF
WALTER WOULD LAY ON IT,

379
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,613
HIS WEIGHT WOULD
HOLD THE BED DOWN.

380
00:16:56,646 --> 00:16:59,549
IS THAT THE QUICKEST
WAY THERE, DO YOU THINK?

381
00:16:59,616 --> 00:17:01,017
ANYWAY, HE GETS ON THERE.

382
00:17:01,084 --> 00:17:03,553
NOW WE GET HER LOADED
ON TO THE BACK OF THE TRUCK.

383
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,955
I MEAN, WALTER
HAS TO STAY THERE,

384
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:06,156
BUT IT'S GOOD.

385
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:08,125
HE CAN SEE WHERE
HIS NEW HOUSE IS.

386
00:17:08,158 --> 00:17:09,392
AND WE'RE ALL SET TO GO.

387
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:10,794
AND YOU KNOW, THAT WOULD'VE
BEEN THE END OF IT.

388
00:17:10,827 --> 00:17:12,996
IT'S A PERFECT DAY.
EVERYTHING TURNED OUT GREAT.

389
00:17:13,063 --> 00:17:15,198
BUT WE FORGOT ABOUT THE PIPES
THAT WINSTON HAD LEFT,

390
00:17:15,232 --> 00:17:17,801
AND THEN AWAY SHE GOES.

391
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:21,771
AND -- OH!

392
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:23,206
WELL, THAT'S EVEN BETTER,

393
00:17:23,273 --> 00:17:25,375
BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID WE WERE
GOING TO LEAVE A BOX BEHIND.

394
00:17:25,408 --> 00:17:28,979
BUT WE GOT EVERYTHING NOW,
INCLUDING WALTER.

395
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:30,580
AND WALTER, WHAT YOU
CAN DO NOW, I GUESS,

396
00:17:30,647 --> 00:17:33,149
IS STAY BACK THERE
AND HOLD THE LOAD ON.

397
00:17:34,818 --> 00:17:38,655
HE WON'T ASK US TO HELP
HIM NEXT TIME, WILL HE?

398
00:17:38,688 --> 00:17:41,758
[ APPLAUSE ]

399
00:17:58,942 --> 00:18:00,410
YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY'S
BEEN BUGGING ME

400
00:18:00,443 --> 00:18:03,813
THAT I SHOULD DRIVE A MORE
FUEL-EFFICIENT VEHICLE.

401
00:18:03,847 --> 00:18:07,417
BUT I THINK I'VE COME UP WITH
A BETTER WAY TO DO THE SAME
DARNED THING.

402
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,753
NOW, I KNOW IF YOU
FOLLOW CLOSE ENOUGH BEHIND

403
00:18:09,819 --> 00:18:11,855
ONE OF THESE BIG
TRACTOR TRAILER UNITS,

404
00:18:11,921 --> 00:18:13,390
YOU CAN SAVE A LOT OF GAS

405
00:18:13,456 --> 00:18:15,892
BECAUSE THE TRUCK IS
BLOCKING THE AIR RESISTANCE.

406
00:18:15,925 --> 00:18:17,360
IN OTHER WORDS,
IT'S BREAKING THE WIND

407
00:18:17,394 --> 00:18:19,963
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

408
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:23,700
BUT HERE'S A WAY
TO NOT BURN ANY GAS.

409
00:18:23,767 --> 00:18:25,468
I TOOK THE
PULL START MECHANISM

410
00:18:25,535 --> 00:18:27,203
OFF OF A LAWN MOWER
THAT I BORROWED,

411
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,473
AND THEN I MOUNTED HER ONTO
THE HOOD OF MY CAR HERE.

412
00:18:30,507 --> 00:18:32,275
HAD TO ADD A LITTLE
EXTRA ROPE TO HER,

413
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:35,912
BUT WHAT I END UP WITH IS A
SPRING LOADED TOE MECHANISM

414
00:18:35,979 --> 00:18:39,215
THAT I HAVE COMPLETE
CONTROL OVER.

415
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:41,785
NOW, I KNOW YOU'RE THINKING,
HEY, THIS IS DANGEROUS.

416
00:18:41,818 --> 00:18:43,453
I MEAN, TRUCK DRIVERS
ARE BIG STRONG GUYS.

417
00:18:43,486 --> 00:18:45,088
THEY COULD EASILY
COME BACK HERE

418
00:18:45,155 --> 00:18:49,959
AND TEST THE LIMITS
OF MY DENTAL PLAN.

419
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,896
BUT FOR THAT TO HAPPEN THEY'D
HAVE TO SEE ME FIRST,
WOULDN'T THEY?

420
00:19:09,712 --> 00:19:12,582
IF THE GUY STARTS HEADING
IN SOME DIRECTION I
DON'T WANNA GO,

421
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:15,351
I JUST RELEASE THE HANDLE,
DROP HER INTO GEAR

422
00:19:15,385 --> 00:19:18,087
AND HEAD FOR
THE NEXT TRUCK STOP.

423
00:19:22,292 --> 00:19:25,094
[ APPLAUSE ]

424
00:19:28,431 --> 00:19:32,135
[ coughing ]

425
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,504
THERE WE GO.
WE'RE GOOD.

426
00:19:34,571 --> 00:19:35,572
WE'RE GOOD.

427
00:19:35,638 --> 00:19:36,839
NO PROBLEM.
NO PROBLEM, HAROLD.

428
00:19:36,873 --> 00:19:38,308
NO PROBLEM?!

429
00:19:38,374 --> 00:19:40,577
WE ALMOST BURNED
THE LODGE DOWN!

430
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,212
AND THAT'S
NO PROBLEM?

431
00:19:42,278 --> 00:19:45,882
NOW, SEE, TO ME, THE KEY
WORD THERE IS "ALMOST".

432
00:19:45,949 --> 00:19:48,318
AND LOOK WHAT YOU
LEARNED TODAY.

433
00:19:48,384 --> 00:19:50,386
YOU LEARNED THAT
SUNFLOWERS ARE
FLAMMABLE.

434
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,455
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

435
00:19:52,522 --> 00:19:56,192
YOU LEARNED THAT THE FIRE
DEPARTMENT DOESN'T ALWAYS
GET THERE ON TIME.

436
00:19:56,259 --> 00:19:57,994
AND I LEARNED NOT
TO STAND IN WATER

437
00:19:58,027 --> 00:20:00,163
DURING AN
ELECTRICAL FIRE.

438
00:20:00,229 --> 00:20:01,698
WHERE'D THAT WATER
COME FROM ANYWAY?

439
00:20:01,731 --> 00:20:03,633
I'D RATHER
NOT SAY.

440
00:20:07,704 --> 00:20:10,039
AND YOU KNOW,
I'M THINKING
YOU LEARNED

441
00:20:10,106 --> 00:20:11,874
THAT EVERY CLOUD
HAS A SILVER LINING.

442
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:14,577
WELL, NOT WHEN
IT'S A MUSHROOM CLOUD.

443
00:20:14,944 --> 00:20:17,947
SEE, YOU'RE NOT LOOKING
AT THE BIG PICTURE HERE.

444
00:20:18,014 --> 00:20:19,115
WE HAD TO EITHER
HIDE THE LODGE

445
00:20:19,148 --> 00:20:20,650
OR PAY $1,000 FINE.

446
00:20:20,683 --> 00:20:23,486
OKAY, THE SUNFLOWER
PLAN DIDN'T WORK
PERFECTLY.

447
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:25,888
NO, NO,
NOT PERFECTLY, NO!

448
00:20:25,955 --> 00:20:27,256
OKAY. OKAY.

449
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,925
BUT NOW THE CITY'S PUTTING
UP A GREAT BIG BILLBOARD

450
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,293
THAT'S GONNA
BLOCK THE LODGE.

451
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,427
SO MISSION
ACCOMPLISHED.

452
00:20:31,494 --> 00:20:32,628
UNCLE RED,
THE SIGN SAYS,

453
00:20:32,662 --> 00:20:35,598
"TOXIC WASTE.
KEEP OUT"!
