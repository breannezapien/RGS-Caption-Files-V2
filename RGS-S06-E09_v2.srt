1
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:04,037
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

2
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:08,141
HERE'S A MAN
WHO NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION

3
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:10,043
BUT OFTENTIMES AN ALIBI...

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,278
YOUR HERO, MY UNCLE, RED GREEN!

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:15,415
(Applause and cheering)

6
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:16,916
ALL RIGHT.

7
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:18,485
THANKS VERY MUCH!

8
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:19,919
ATTABOY, HAROLD.

9
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:21,421
(Applause)

10
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:22,756
THANK YOU.

11
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:24,424
WE HAD A PROBLEM YESTERDAY.

12
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:25,759
JUNIOR GOT A NEW

13
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:27,727
REAR-VIEW MIRROR FOR HIS CAR.

14
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:29,429
HE BORROWED A CORDLESS DRILL

15
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:30,830
FROM ALFIE DINKLE

16
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:32,265
TO INSTALL THE THING.

17
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:33,867
THIS WAS A HUGE MIRROR.

18
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,935
IT WAS FROM THE SPACE SHUTTLE.

19
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:37,504
ABOUT FOUR FEET WIDE --

20
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,006
KIND OF A REAR-VIEW MIRROR
IMAX DEAL.

21
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,674
HE GOT THAT MOUNTED.

22
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:43,843
HE CAN SEE EVERYTHING
BEHIND HIM.

23
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,912
DOESN'T HAVE TO TURN HIS HEAD.

24
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,181
HE SEES EVERYTHING
BEHIND THE CAR.

25
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:49,516
IT'S TOO BAD

26
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:51,518
THE BLUEBERRY STAND
WAS IN FRONT OF IT.

27
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:52,852
HE HIT IT HEAD-ON!

28
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,521
HE WIPED 'ER OUT OF THERE!

29
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:55,922
NAILED 'ER -- OH, MAN!

30
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:58,124
IT'S OK, THOUGH --
NOBODY WAS HURT.

31
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:01,427
THE BLUEBERRIES ACTED
LIKE A MILLION LITTLE AIRBAGS.

32
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:03,496
JUNIOR'S CAR'S
NOT WHITE ANY MORE.

33
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,231
IT'S LIKE A BLUEBERRY BLUE.

34
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:07,867
YEAH, BUT HE'S GONNA TAKE
THAT MIRROR OFF,

35
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,970
BUT HE CAN'T BORROW
THE CORDLESS DRILL FROM ALFIE

36
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:14,407
BECAUSE ALFIE WAS ALSO THE
OWNER OF THE BLUEBERRY STAND.

37
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:15,909
HE'S A LITTLE TICKED.

38
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:17,410
HA! HE'S CRUSHED.

39
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:18,912
(Laughing)

40
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:20,813
SO NOW, GET THIS, GET THIS.

41
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,117
JUNIOR HAS GIVEN HAROLD
100 BUCKS -- SHOW 'EM --

42
00:01:24,183 --> 00:01:26,085
TO BUY HIM
A NEW CORDLESS DRILL.

43
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:27,420
HOW ABOUT THAT, HUH?

44
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:28,921
THAT'S EXCELLENT!

45
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:31,424
BUYING A POWER TOOL
MAKES YOU A MAN.

46
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,925
(Audience laughing)

47
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:36,596
THEN YOU BETTER MAKE SURE
YOU GET IT HALF-OFF.

48
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:37,997
(Audience laughing)

49
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:43,002
(Horns honking)

50
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,605
(Geese honking)

51
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:49,108
(Quacking)

52
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,580
(Red): YOU'RE LOOKIN'
AT SEGMENTS

53
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,315
FROM THIS PARTICULAR SHOW,

54
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,018
THE MESSAGE BEING, FOR
GOSH SAKES, DON'T EVEN THINK

55
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:00,319
ABOUT CHANGING THE CHANNEL.

56
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:03,022
TO MAKE SENSE
OUT OF THIS PROGRAMME,

57
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,357
YOU GOTTA GIVE IT

58
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,125
YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.

59
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,601
I HOPE HAROLD CAN HANDLE
THE PRESSURE

60
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:17,036
OF BUYING THIS DRILL.

61
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:19,071
THIS COULD BE A TURNING POINT.

62
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:21,908
MAYBE THE KIDS WON'T BEAT UP
ON HIM SO BAD.

63
00:02:21,974 --> 00:02:24,076
WHEN THEY SEE
THAT CORDLESS UNIT,

64
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:26,879
MIGHT GIVE THEM THE IDEA
TO DRILL HIM ONE!

65
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,314
UNCLE RED, I GOT IT!

66
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,383
IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DRILL.

67
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:32,618
IT'S CORDLESS, IT'S REVERSIBLE.

68
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:35,421
IT'S GOT EXTRA BATTERIES
AND A CHARGER,

69
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,758
BITS, CARRYING CASE,
TOP OF THE LINE, $97.

70
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,560
"YES, PLEASE, RING IT THROUGH.

71
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:42,061
"HAVE A RAINBOW DAY."

72
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:43,362
(Laughing)

73
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,565
97 BUCKS, HAROLD?

74
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:48,234
BOY, THEY SAW YOU COMING,
DIDN'T THEY?

75
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,770
I GOT IT AT LENNY'S
ELECTRICAL SHOP.

76
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:52,305
DON'T BUY FROM LENNY'S.

77
00:02:52,371 --> 00:02:54,407
HE HATES US --
WE OWE HIM MONEY.

78
00:02:54,473 --> 00:02:56,909
IF I ONLY SHOPPED PLACES
YOU DON'T OWE MONEY TO,

79
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,411
I'D HAVE TO GO TO FRANCE.

80
00:02:58,477 --> 00:03:01,013
YOU DON'T WANT TO BUY STUFF
FROM LENNY.

81
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,481
HE'S JUST A MIDDLEMAN.

82
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:03,816
HE'S GOT OVERHEAD.

83
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:06,652
IT'S A SHOP HE RUNS
OUT OF HIS BASEMENT!

84
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,987
THAT CAN'T BE CHEAP.

85
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:10,122
THE SUMP PUMP'S ALWAYS RUNNING.

86
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:13,059
THAT'S CRAZY --
$97 IS A FAIR PRICE.

87
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,695
THEY'RE $94.50
AT THE HARDWARE AND SUCH.

88
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:19,165
YEAH, OK, THREE BUCKS,
BIG DEAL.

89
00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:21,500
YOU SAVE THREE BUCKS A DAY
FOR A MONTH,

90
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:22,868
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU GOT?

91
00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:25,371
THAT DEPENDS ON THE MONTH.

92
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:26,839
WELL, NO, IT DOESN'T.

93
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:30,309
THREE BUCKS IS THREE BUCKS,
WHETHER IT'S FEBRUARY OR MAY!

94
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,945
THESE KIDS TODAY,
THEY GOT NO MONEY SENSE.

95
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:36,916
I'LL GET A DRILL SO CHEAP,
IT WILL MAKE YOUR HEAD SPIN.

96
00:03:36,982 --> 00:03:40,886
IF IT MADE HIS HEAD SPIN,
WE WOULDN'T NEED A DRILL.

97
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:43,956
(Audience laughing)

98
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:47,460
(Red): LATER, WE'LL HAVE
THE "ADVENTURES WITH BILL".

99
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:50,429
WHAT HE'LL BE DOING THIS WEEK,
REAL EXCITING.

100
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,698
NO, IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

101
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,300
HE'S GONNA DO
SOME POLE-VAULTING.

102
00:03:54,366 --> 00:03:55,835
OH, YEAH.

103
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:57,503
OOOH!

104
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,271
BY GOLLY!

105
00:03:59,338 --> 00:04:01,707
FOR HIS FIRST CHALLENGE,

106
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:04,510
HE'S GONNA TRY
AND VAULT OVER THE VAN.

107
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,679
GOSH, I HOPE THIS GOES WELL.

108
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,414
(Bill): EEEEEYAH!

109
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:09,915
OHHHH!

110
00:04:09,982 --> 00:04:12,051
(Red): PERFECT!

111
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,186
OHHHHH

112
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:18,023
HAPPY, HAPPY PEOPLE
CALL ME ON THE PHONE

113
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,226
TO TELL ME ABOUT
SOME NUT-BAR PRODUCT

114
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:21,727
THEY THINK I SHOULD OWN

115
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,629
IF YOU LOOK BACK
THROUGH HISTORY

116
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,197
AT THE CAUSE
OF EVERY WAR

117
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:27,266
YOU'LL FIND
HAPPY, HAPPY PEOPLE

118
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,734
HAPPY, HAPPY PEOPLE

119
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,603
AND AN ARMY OF GUYS
LIKE ME

120
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:32,872
WHO JUST COULDN'T TAKE IT
ANY MORE

121
00:04:32,938 --> 00:04:34,440
AOOO!

122
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:39,144
WE'RE PLAYING
FOR THE GRAND PRIZE

123
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:42,081
OF A TURNIP FARM
AND FOUR TONS OF WAX.

124
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:44,383
UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS

125
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,820
TO GET MR. BUZZ SHERWOOD
TO SAY THIS WORD...

126
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:50,122
BUZZ? EXCELLENT.

127
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,624
THE WORD IS...

128
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,158
"QUIET".

129
00:04:53,225 --> 00:04:54,493
"QUIET".

130
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,995
OH, WE GET IT.

131
00:04:56,061 --> 00:04:57,496
AND GO!

132
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:58,898
OK, BUZZ.
OH, COOL!

133
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:01,166
A MACHINE THAT ISN'T LOUD IS...

134
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:02,501
BROKEN!

135
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:03,936
(Audience laughing)

136
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:07,039
NO, IF YOU DON'T MAKE
ANY NOISE, YOU'RE...

137
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,774
OH, YOU'RE DEAD, MAN!

138
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,276
(Laughing)

139
00:05:10,342 --> 00:05:12,645
I'M NOT...
PEACE AND...

140
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:15,114
CARROTS!

141
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,449
NOT PEAS! PEACE!

142
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:18,951
OH, PEACE.
PEACE AND...

143
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:21,654
LOVE? UH, COME TOGETHER?

144
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,155
RASH?

145
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,657
NO, NO, HOLD IT.

146
00:05:24,723 --> 00:05:27,559
PEOPLE COME UP TO POSSUM LODGE

147
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:29,361
FOR THE PEACE
AND...

148
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:31,163
WITNESS RELOCATION!

149
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,498
(Audience laughing)

150
00:05:32,564 --> 00:05:34,500
WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME.

151
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:36,468
I KNOW --
I'M THINKING...

152
00:05:36,535 --> 00:05:37,803
THINK MOVIES, OK?

153
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,172
"ALL 'SOMETHING'
ON THE WESTERN FRONT".

154
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:43,042
"ALL 'SOMETHING'
ON THE WESTERN FRONT".

155
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:44,443
UM... FOOD STAINS!

156
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,778
(Singing)

157
00:05:45,844 --> 00:05:47,279
UM... CHEST HAIR?

158
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:50,816
I WISH YOU'D JUST
BE QUIET FOR A SECOND!

159
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:52,317
WHOA!

160
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:53,819
(Applause)

161
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,354
THERE YOU GO.

162
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,722
WE'RE OUT OF TIME.

163
00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:00,092
ONE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
MY GENERATION AND HAROLD'S

164
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,994
IS HE NEVER GOT TO EXPERIENCE

165
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,630
THOSE REAR-ENGINE,
REAR-WHEEL-DRIVE CARS.

166
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:07,533
YOU KNOW, THE VOLKSWAGEN
BEETLE, THE CORVAIR.

167
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:10,402
THEY SAY THE CORVAIR
WAS UNSAFE AT ANY SPEED.

168
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:12,337
I'M SORRY HAROLD MISSED THAT.

169
00:06:12,404 --> 00:06:14,540
SO THIS WEEK
ON "HANDYMAN CORNER",

170
00:06:14,606 --> 00:06:16,608
WE'RE GONNA TAKE
A FRONT-ENGINE,

171
00:06:16,675 --> 00:06:18,076
FRONT-WHEEL-DRIVE CAR

172
00:06:18,143 --> 00:06:21,747
AND TURN IT INTO A REAR-ENGINE,
REAR-WHEEL-DRIVE CLASSIC.

173
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:25,851
ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS JUST
TAKE THE ENGINE OUT, MOVE THAT.

174
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,854
YOU GOTTA MOVE THE RAD
AND THE BATTERY

175
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,556
AND THE WINDSHIELD...

176
00:06:30,622 --> 00:06:32,057
ALL RIGHT.

177
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:35,861
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH DUCT TAPE
IN THE WORLD FOR THAT JOB.

178
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,996
NOW WE'RE SCUPPERED...

179
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:40,365
UNLESS...

180
00:06:40,432 --> 00:06:42,501
YOU KNOW, THAT JUST MIGHT WORK.

181
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,636
EVEN IF IT DOESN'T,
I DON'T CARE.

182
00:06:44,703 --> 00:06:46,805
THIS IS OLD MAN SEDGWICK'S CAR.

183
00:06:46,872 --> 00:06:49,942
TO TURN A FRONT-ENGINE
FRONT-WHEEL-DRIVE VEHICLE

184
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:52,811
INTO A REAR-ENGINE,
REAR-WHEEL-DRIVE VEHICLE

185
00:06:52,878 --> 00:06:54,346
TURN EVERYTHING AROUND.

186
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,281
PUT THE CONTROLS AT THE BACK.

187
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:58,617
HAVE THE SEATS FACING
THE OTHER WAY.

188
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,852
THERE YOU ARE --
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

189
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:02,688
TO GET THE FRONT SEAT OUT,

190
00:07:02,754 --> 00:07:05,824
ALL YOU NEED IS
MAYBE SOME TOOLS, SOME OIL...

191
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:07,492
OR... JUST SOME RUST.

192
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:10,128
I MEAN, RUST IS
A NATURAL PROCESS.

193
00:07:10,195 --> 00:07:13,398
IT'S ALWAYS GOOD
TO WORK WITH NATURE.

194
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:32,551
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

195
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:34,586
ONCE YOU GOT THE SEAT REMOVED,

196
00:07:34,653 --> 00:07:36,955
AND YOU'VE REMOVED
THE UPHOLSTERY --

197
00:07:37,022 --> 00:07:39,925
WHICH YOU SHOULD REPLACE
FROM TIME TO TIME --

198
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:42,861
LET 'ER COOL DOWN,
AND TAKE THE DRIVER'S SEAT

199
00:07:42,928 --> 00:07:45,097
AND PUT 'ER
IN THE CAR BACKWARDS.

200
00:07:45,163 --> 00:07:46,732
YOU WANT TO SECURE THAT.

201
00:07:46,798 --> 00:07:49,234
YOU CAN BOLT IT DOWN,
YOU CAN WELD IT,

202
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:51,470
OR YOU COULD DO
WHAT I LIKE TO DO --

203
00:07:51,536 --> 00:07:53,805
USE THE HANDYMAN'S
SECRET WEAPON...

204
00:07:53,872 --> 00:07:55,207
DUCT TAPE.

205
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,644
YOU COULD USE THIS
AS YOUR NEW UPHOLSTERY.

206
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:01,880
IF YOU PUT IT ON
STICKY-SIDE-OUT,

207
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:04,149
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN NEED
SEATBELTS.

208
00:08:04,216 --> 00:08:05,684
(Sizzling)

209
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,821
ONCE YOU GOT 'ER ALL DONE,
YOU JUST MOUNT 'ER INSIDE...

210
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:11,323
(Grunting)

211
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:13,425
... WITH MORE OF THE SAME.

212
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:17,229
(Grunting)

213
00:08:17,295 --> 00:08:20,632
RATHER THAN TAKE THE CONTROLS
AND MOUNT THEM ON THE BACK,

214
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,968
GET DIFFERENT CONTROLS
OUT OF A BOAT...

215
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:24,636
MAYBE A BOAT
YOU DON'T WANT,

216
00:08:24,703 --> 00:08:27,672
OR SOMEBODY DOESN'T WANT...
OR AT LEAST THEY WON'T,

217
00:08:27,739 --> 00:08:30,942
AS SOON AS THEY FIND OUT
THE CONTROLS BEEN RIPPED OUT.

218
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:33,144
TAKE THE STEERING WHEEL
FROM THE BOAT

219
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:35,847
AND HOOK THAT UP
TO THE CAR'S STEERING WHEEL.

220
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:37,882
YOUR GAS PEDAL, YOU HOOK UP

221
00:08:37,949 --> 00:08:40,485
TO THE HAND THROTTLE
FROM THE BOAT,

222
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:44,256
AND AS FAR AS THE BRAKES GO,
USE YOUR ANCHOR ROPE.

223
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,858
(Grunting)

224
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:53,365
(Grunting)

225
00:08:57,502 --> 00:08:59,604
I GOT OUR CONTROLS
ALL HOOKED UP.

226
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:03,174
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS, WE GOT
THE HEADLIGHTS AT THE BACK.

227
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:05,510
WE GOT THE TAIL-LIGHTS
AT THE FRONT.

228
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:08,313
TO CORRECT THAT,
WE GOTTA TAKE THOSE OFF...

229
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,449
OK, IT'S A PHILLIPS
SCREWDRIVER.

230
00:09:14,552 --> 00:09:16,588
YOU'LL NEED
PLASTIC FLOWER-HOLDERS

231
00:09:16,654 --> 00:09:19,457
AND YOU CAN TURN HEADLIGHTS
INTO TAIL-LIGHTS.

232
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:27,432
WE GOT THE CONTROLS ALL SET UP
AND SHE'S READY TO GO BOATING--

233
00:09:27,499 --> 00:09:30,034
OR, I SHOULD SAY, DRIVING --
WATCH THIS.

234
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:32,003
(Squeaking)

235
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,838
AND START 'ER UP.

236
00:09:33,905 --> 00:09:36,841
(Engine whirring)

237
00:09:36,908 --> 00:09:38,176
IT'S JUST THAT EASY

238
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:40,712
TO TURN A FRONT-WHEEL-DRIVE,
FRONT-ENGINE CAR

239
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:43,047
INTO A REAR-WHEEL-DRIVE,
REAR-ENGINE CAR.

240
00:09:43,114 --> 00:09:44,849
JUST PUT EVERYTHING IN REVERSE.

241
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,385
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

242
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:49,354
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

243
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,156
IT'S THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS.

244
00:09:51,222 --> 00:09:53,892
SHE LOOKS LIKE A CAR,
DRIVES LIKE A BOAT...

245
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:57,896
"THE TITANIC"!

246
00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:04,435
STAY TUNED -- WHATEVER THIS IS,
WE GOT LOTS MORE OF IT.

247
00:10:08,072 --> 00:10:10,208
WANT TO TALK
TO YOU LADIES OUT THERE

248
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:11,643
SO THAT YOU DON'T PANIC

249
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:14,512
WHEN YOUR HUSBAND
STARTS GOING A LITTLE WACKY.

250
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:16,514
(Audience laughing)

251
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:21,052
A MAN GETS TO A CERTAIN AGE,
HE LOOKS AROUND AND HE REALIZES

252
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:23,855
HE BASICALLY HAS NOTHING
TO SHOW FOR HIS LIFE.

253
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:27,225
HE MAY HAVE SPENT THE LAST
25 YEARS SITTING AT A DESK,

254
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:29,827
OR MAYBE BEING ON THE PHONE
ALL THAT TIME,

255
00:10:29,894 --> 00:10:33,231
AND THE ONLY PROGRESS HE'S MADE
IS BUILDING A HUGE GUT

256
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:35,466
THAT PROTECTS HIS BELT
FROM THE SUN.

257
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:37,969
(Laughing and applause)

258
00:10:38,036 --> 00:10:39,470
SO...

259
00:10:39,537 --> 00:10:42,473
(Laughing)

260
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,442
YOU MAY FIND, AT THIS POINT,

261
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:48,479
THAT YOUR MAN WILL GO OUT AND
BUY HIMSELF SOME POWER TOOLS

262
00:10:48,546 --> 00:10:51,082
AND START DISAPPEARING
INTO THE GARAGE

263
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:52,850
FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME.

264
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:55,053
THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

265
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:56,954
WHAT HE'S DOING IS BUILDING

266
00:10:57,021 --> 00:11:00,024
SOME HUGE, CLUMSY,
ODD-LOOKING PIECE OF CRAP

267
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:03,995
THAT HE'S GONNA LEAVE BEHIND
SO PEOPLE WILL REMEMBER HIM.

268
00:11:04,062 --> 00:11:06,164
THEY WON'T BE FOND MEMORIES,

269
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,000
BUT HE DOESN'T NEED
TO KNOW THAT NOW.

270
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:10,802
AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.

271
00:11:10,868 --> 00:11:12,270
IF HIS MOTHER HAD KEPT

272
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:15,406
THAT 65-POUND ASHTRAY
HE BROUGHT HOME IN GRADE 5,

273
00:11:15,473 --> 00:11:17,508
NONE OF THIS
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

274
00:11:17,575 --> 00:11:19,944
HERE'S SOMETHING
FOR YOU MOMS TO REMEMBER.

275
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:21,379
WHEN YOUR SON COMES HOME

276
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:23,614
WITH HIS FIRST PROJECT,
YOU TREASURE IT.

277
00:11:23,681 --> 00:11:25,249
LEAVE IT OUT ON THE COUNTER

278
00:11:25,316 --> 00:11:28,052
WHERE EVERYBODY GETS
TO LOOK AT IT ALL THE TIME.

279
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:31,289
YOU'LL BE DOING HIS FUTURE WIFE
A HUGE FAVOUR.

280
00:11:31,355 --> 00:11:33,491
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

281
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:35,460
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

282
00:11:35,526 --> 00:11:40,164
(Laughing and applause)

283
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:43,468
DOES IT HURT
YET?

284
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:44,936
CUT IT OUT, HAROLD.

285
00:11:45,002 --> 00:11:48,873
I FOUND THE SAME CORDLESS DRILL
AT THE DRILL DEPOT.

286
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,809
INSTEAD OF $97,
IT WAS $86.99, HAROLD.

287
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:54,412
WOW, THAT'S LIKE
A $10.01 SAVINGS.

288
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:57,348
BUT THERE WAS NO CASE
AND NO DRILL BITS.

289
00:11:57,415 --> 00:11:58,749
SO THE ONE I GOT IS OK.

290
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:02,286
NO, BECAUSE THEN I WENT TO
POWER TOOLS R US.

291
00:12:02,353 --> 00:12:05,489
THAT'S POWER TOOLS RUST --
THE "T" FELL OFF THE SIGN.

292
00:12:05,556 --> 00:12:08,426
WELL, THEY HAD IT FOR
EIGHT BUCKS LESS.

293
00:12:08,492 --> 00:12:09,994
SO YOU GOT THAT ONE.

294
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:11,963
IT DIDN'T COME WITH
A CHARGER.

295
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:13,965
THEN I WENT TO NUMBER LUMBER.

296
00:12:14,031 --> 00:12:17,201
I THOUGHT WE WEREN'T ALLOWED
BACK IN THAT STORE.

297
00:12:17,268 --> 00:12:19,470
WELL, I WAITED TILL
HIS WIFE LEFT.

298
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:21,339
I PROMISED TO PAY HIM CASH.

299
00:12:21,405 --> 00:12:22,840
THAT HELPS.

300
00:12:22,907 --> 00:12:24,775
HE HAD THE DRILL, THE CASE,

301
00:12:24,842 --> 00:12:27,545
THE CHARGER, AND DRILL BITS,
80 BUCKS.

302
00:12:27,612 --> 00:12:29,947
EXCELLENT, OK.

303
00:12:30,014 --> 00:12:31,282
BUT NO STOCK.

304
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:34,785
SO NOW I'M GOING TO
BILL'S BUILD-ALL IN BUILDINGS.

305
00:12:34,852 --> 00:12:37,288
WHAT ABOUT
ALL YOUR TIME AND GAS?

306
00:12:37,355 --> 00:12:39,690
HAROLD, WHEN YOU GET TO MY AGE,

307
00:12:39,757 --> 00:12:42,293
TIME AND GAS IS
ALL YOU HAVE LEFT.

308
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,762
(Applause)

309
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:47,331
ALL RIGHT, TIME FOR

310
00:12:47,398 --> 00:12:48,833
"ADVENTURES WITH BILL".

311
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,334
BILL'S GONNA DO

312
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:51,669
SOME POLE-VAULTING.

313
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:53,471
THAT GROUND'S PRETTY HARD.

314
00:12:53,537 --> 00:12:56,974
YOU'RE GONNA BREAK
EVERY BONE IN YOUR BODY.

315
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,909
HE'S GOT ANOTHER IDEA.

316
00:12:58,976 --> 00:13:01,545
HE'S GOT SOME TYPE OF PADDING

317
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:03,247
LEFT FROM THE DISCO ERA.

318
00:13:03,314 --> 00:13:05,182
BOY OH BOY.

319
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:06,684
OH MY GOSH.

320
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:08,486
HOLY MACKEREL!

321
00:13:08,552 --> 00:13:12,456
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
UNCOMFORTABLE TO SIT ON.

322
00:13:12,523 --> 00:13:15,025
HE'S GONNA USE THAT AS A...

323
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:18,496
THAT WOULD BE
THE LANDING AREA THERE.

324
00:13:18,562 --> 00:13:19,997
THAT MAKES SENSE.

325
00:13:20,064 --> 00:13:21,499
NOW WHAT, BILL?

326
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:23,167
ALL RIGHT.

327
00:13:23,234 --> 00:13:26,437
I DON'T KNOW QUITE
WHAT HE'S GOT IN MIND,

328
00:13:26,504 --> 00:13:27,938
BUT WE'LL SEE.

329
00:13:28,005 --> 00:13:30,441
THAT CAN'T BE
ALL THERE IS TO IT.

330
00:13:30,508 --> 00:13:32,243
ALL RIGHT, UH...

331
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:33,744
AWAY HE GOES.

332
00:13:33,811 --> 00:13:35,246
THE HARD GROUND.

333
00:13:35,312 --> 00:13:36,947
SHE WON'T DIG IN.

334
00:13:37,014 --> 00:13:38,482
THERE YOU GO.

335
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:40,317
YOU'RE TOO CLOSE!

336
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:42,520
OH BOY.

337
00:13:42,586 --> 00:13:44,054
YOU'RE TOO CLOSE.

338
00:13:44,121 --> 00:13:46,190
SO HE NEEDS TO MAKE
A SPOT THERE.

339
00:13:46,257 --> 00:13:47,858
SO, HE'S GONNA HAVE ME...

340
00:13:47,925 --> 00:13:50,528
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING OF HERE.

341
00:13:50,594 --> 00:13:52,396
BUT HE WANTED TO USE MY FOOT

342
00:13:52,463 --> 00:13:54,331
AS THE BACK-STOP
FOR THE POLE.

343
00:13:54,398 --> 00:13:55,833
I'M GETTING A LITTLE...

344
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,334
SO I JUST...

345
00:13:57,401 --> 00:13:58,836
OH BOY, OH BOY, OH BOY.

346
00:13:58,903 --> 00:14:00,304
LOOK OUT, LOOK OUT.

347
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:01,705
WHOA!

348
00:14:01,772 --> 00:14:03,474
OH, HEY, HEY!

349
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,110
HEY, THAT'S COLD.

350
00:14:06,176 --> 00:14:07,611
MAKE A WISH.

351
00:14:07,678 --> 00:14:10,014
ALL RIGHT,
HE'S GOT A BETTER IDEA.

352
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,916
HE'S GONNA PLANT A HOLE...

353
00:14:11,982 --> 00:14:13,417
OW!

354
00:14:13,484 --> 00:14:15,185
... RIGHT IN MY FOOT.

355
00:14:15,252 --> 00:14:16,687
THANK YOU, BILL.

356
00:14:16,754 --> 00:14:18,188
THERE YOU GO.

357
00:14:18,255 --> 00:14:19,957
ALL RIGHT, THERE YOU GO.

358
00:14:20,024 --> 00:14:21,492
BACK HE GOES.

359
00:14:21,558 --> 00:14:22,993
JUST BACK AWAY.

360
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:27,064
AND HERE HE COMES --
MR. ATHLETE.

361
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:28,565
AND

362
00:14:28,632 --> 00:14:30,034
THERE HE GOES!

363
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,935
YOU'RE GONNA CLEAR IT.

364
00:14:32,002 --> 00:14:36,707
IT'S GONNA TAKE A FEW MINUTES
TO GET BILL'S HEAD OUT

365
00:14:36,774 --> 00:14:38,409
FROM HIS SHOULDER BLADES.

366
00:14:38,475 --> 00:14:41,278
WE'LL FINISH THE ADVENTURE
A LITTLE LATER.

367
00:14:41,345 --> 00:14:43,314
WITH MY 12-STEP PROGRAMME,

368
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:47,284
I CAN HELP YOU OVERCOME
THAT BIOLOGICAL IMPERATIVE.

369
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:49,853
NO MORE "SORRY,
IT'S A GUY THING."

370
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,157
I WANT TO START BY
CALLING ON MY UNCLE RED.

371
00:14:53,223 --> 00:14:55,459
OH, MAN -- NO, NO, NO.

372
00:14:55,526 --> 00:14:57,361
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

373
00:14:57,428 --> 00:14:59,463
NEVER MIND.

374
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:02,633
ALL RIGHT, UH...
MY NAME IS RED AND I'M A MAN.

375
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:05,002
HI, RED.

376
00:15:05,069 --> 00:15:07,538
LET'S DO THE
"MEN ANONYMOUS" PLEDGE.

377
00:15:07,604 --> 00:15:10,007
(All): I AM A MALE,

378
00:15:10,074 --> 00:15:15,045
BUT I CAN CHANGE
IF I HAVE TO, I GUESS.

379
00:15:17,047 --> 00:15:18,482
OK.

380
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:19,983
WELL DONE, WELL DONE.

381
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,286
LET'S JUST OPEN THE MEETING.

382
00:15:22,352 --> 00:15:23,687
LET'S GET STARTED.

383
00:15:23,754 --> 00:15:26,490
WHO WANTS TO SHARE
THEIR FEELINGS?

384
00:15:29,426 --> 00:15:33,430
OK, WHO WANTS TO TELL
A GOOD STORY ABOUT THEMSELVES?

385
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:35,098
OH, OK, GREAT.

386
00:15:35,165 --> 00:15:36,533
UM, DALTON.

387
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,035
(Clearing
throat)

388
00:15:38,101 --> 00:15:39,603
ALL RIGHT,
UH...

389
00:15:41,505 --> 00:15:44,775
MY NAME'S DALTON.

390
00:15:44,842 --> 00:15:46,276
(All): HI, DALTON.

391
00:15:46,343 --> 00:15:47,778
I'M A MAN,

392
00:15:47,845 --> 00:15:50,948
AND I HAVE BEEN
EVER SINCE THE AGE OF 9.

393
00:15:51,014 --> 00:15:52,449
(Audience laughing)

394
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:53,951
I'M WORKING ON IT,

395
00:15:54,017 --> 00:15:56,453
AND UH, YOU KNOW,
ONE DAY AT A TIME.

396
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,090
ANYWAY, I WAS OUT IN THE GARAGE
THE OTHER DAY,

397
00:16:00,157 --> 00:16:01,592
AND I FOUND THIS.

398
00:16:01,658 --> 00:16:03,360
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S FOR

399
00:16:03,427 --> 00:16:05,429
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT DOES.

400
00:16:05,495 --> 00:16:07,598
IT'S NOT WORTH MUCH, OBVIOUSLY.

401
00:16:07,664 --> 00:16:10,300
I CAN'T THINK OF A THING
TO USE IT FOR,

402
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:12,970
SO... I THREW IT OUT.

403
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:14,471
ALL RIGHT.

404
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:16,340
VERY GOOD.

405
00:16:16,406 --> 00:16:17,874
OH BOY.

406
00:16:17,941 --> 00:16:20,177
UH, YOU KNOW,
I KNOW THAT SOMEDAY

407
00:16:20,243 --> 00:16:23,080
I'M GOING TO BE
WORKING AROUND THE HOUSE,

408
00:16:23,146 --> 00:16:25,048
AND I'M GONNA NEED IT, BUT...

409
00:16:25,115 --> 00:16:27,184
IT WILL BE THE PERFECT THING.

410
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,553
I THREW IT OUT.

411
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:31,588
HOW COME YOU STILL HAVE IT?

412
00:16:31,655 --> 00:16:33,857
I THOUGHT OF
WHAT I COULD USE IT FOR,

413
00:16:33,924 --> 00:16:35,959
SO I PULLED IT
OUT OF THE GARBAGE.

414
00:16:36,026 --> 00:16:38,428
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO
USE IT FOR?

415
00:16:38,495 --> 00:16:40,931
WELL...

416
00:16:40,998 --> 00:16:42,532
WELL, TO BRING TO THE MEETING.

417
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:45,769
YOU KNOW, TO SHOW, TO SHOW YOU.

418
00:16:45,836 --> 00:16:47,270
TO SHOW MY RESOLVE.

419
00:16:47,337 --> 00:16:49,873
I'M GONNA KEEP THIS
AS A REMINDER

420
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,341
OF HOW STRONG I AM

421
00:16:51,408 --> 00:16:53,276
WHEN I PUT MY MIND TO IT.

422
00:16:53,343 --> 00:16:54,945
THIS IS A TROPHY!

423
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:56,446
YEAH.

424
00:16:56,513 --> 00:16:57,948
YUP.

425
00:16:58,014 --> 00:16:59,449
(Red): ALL RIGHT.

426
00:16:59,516 --> 00:17:03,253
HERE WE ARE TO FINISH OFF
"ADVENTURES WITH BILL".

427
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,723
HE'S DECIDED THAT ONE POLE
ISN'T LONG ENOUGH.

428
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,593
THAT'S WHY
HE'S NOT CLEARING THE BAR.

429
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:11,795
SO WE GOT A COUPLE TOGETHER.

430
00:17:11,862 --> 00:17:14,498
BOY, THAT...
THAT LOOKS SAFE AND STURDY.

431
00:17:14,564 --> 00:17:15,966
AND SO DOES THE POLE.

432
00:17:16,032 --> 00:17:18,368
AND HE COMES AND HE COMES.

433
00:17:18,435 --> 00:17:19,536
HE PLANTS THAT.

434
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:22,139
AND THEN UP, UP, UP, UP.

435
00:17:22,205 --> 00:17:23,707
WAY YOU GO.

436
00:17:23,773 --> 00:17:25,242
UP, UP.

437
00:17:25,308 --> 00:17:28,745
THIS HAPPENS TO A LOT OF MEN
BILL'S AGE.

438
00:17:28,812 --> 00:17:30,514
COME ON, BILL, GIVE IT UP.

439
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,415
SO WHAT HE DECIDED HE NEEDS

440
00:17:32,482 --> 00:17:33,917
IS MORE SPEED.

441
00:17:33,984 --> 00:17:35,552
THAT'S WHERE THE VAN...

442
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:37,387
IT'S SIR VAULT-A-LOT.

443
00:17:37,454 --> 00:17:38,421
UP HE GOES.

444
00:17:38,488 --> 00:17:40,557
AND AWAY YOU GO OVER THE BAR.

445
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:44,027
HEY, THAT'S THREE POINTS.

446
00:17:44,094 --> 00:17:45,562
OW!... OHH!

447
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:49,933
I THINK THAT WE'VE FINALLY GOT
THIS THING FINISHED OFF,

448
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,434
DON'T WE, BILL?

449
00:17:51,501 --> 00:17:53,970
YEAH, HE'S FINISHED OFF.

450
00:17:54,037 --> 00:17:55,939
SPECIAL THANKS
TO A VIEWER

451
00:17:56,006 --> 00:17:57,440
FOR THESE
BAND-AIDS

452
00:17:57,507 --> 00:17:59,009
MADE FROM
DUCT TAPE.

453
00:18:04,948 --> 00:18:08,451
THERE IS NOTHING
LIKE GETTING BARGAINS

454
00:18:08,518 --> 00:18:10,620
TO MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD.

455
00:18:10,687 --> 00:18:14,357
THEN, WITH THE MONEY YOU SAVE,
YOU CAN BUY MORE BARGAINS.

456
00:18:14,424 --> 00:18:16,559
HOW MUCH WAS
THE CORDLESS DRILL?

457
00:18:16,626 --> 00:18:20,730
OH -- WE ALMOST BOUGHT ONE
UP IN PORT ASBESTOS.

458
00:18:20,797 --> 00:18:23,833
YOU WENT ALL THE WAY
TO PORT ASBESTOS

459
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,235
TO SAVE A FEW BUCKS?

460
00:18:25,301 --> 00:18:29,305
TO SAVE AN EXTRA DOLLAR,
YOU GOTTA GO AN EXTRA MILE.

461
00:18:29,372 --> 00:18:30,874
AN EXTRA 125 MILES?!

462
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,043
DID YOU SAVE AN EXTRA $125?

463
00:18:33,109 --> 00:18:34,477
'CAUSE IF YOU DID,

464
00:18:34,544 --> 00:18:37,947
THAT MEANS YOU SPENT
MINUS $28 ON THE DRILL.

465
00:18:38,014 --> 00:18:40,950
THEY HAD ONE AT
THE SHOPPERS CLUB, $72.50.

466
00:18:41,017 --> 00:18:44,154
MIND YOU, YOU HAD TO BE THERE
FOR THE SPECIAL,

467
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,956
CLIP THE COUPON,
CASH IN YOUR AIR MILES,

468
00:18:47,023 --> 00:18:49,025
THEN YOU HAD
TO SCRATCH-AND-SAVE

469
00:18:49,092 --> 00:18:50,593
AND MAIL IN THE REBATE.

470
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,228
SO HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY?

471
00:18:52,295 --> 00:18:53,730
WELL, NOTHING, HAROLD.

472
00:18:53,797 --> 00:18:56,499
THERE WAS
SO MANY OTHER BARGAINS.

473
00:18:56,566 --> 00:19:00,170
CHEESE, THEY HAD 25 POUNDS
OF CHEESE FOR 10 BUCKS.

474
00:19:00,236 --> 00:19:02,172
AND IT LOOKED GREAT.

475
00:19:02,238 --> 00:19:03,673
REALLY ORANGEY.

476
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,975
AND THEN YOU GET
THAT MUCH CHEESE,

477
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:08,111
YOU GOTTA GO WITH THE CRACKERS.

478
00:19:08,178 --> 00:19:10,513
A HUGE BUCKET OF CRACKER,
23 BUCKS.

479
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,116
OLD MAN SEDGWICK GOT
A BIG BARREL OF LEGO.

480
00:19:13,183 --> 00:19:15,385
HOW MUCH TO JOIN THIS CLUB?

481
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:16,886
ONLY 45 BUCKS.

482
00:19:16,953 --> 00:19:20,590
YOU SEE WHY WE DIDN'T HAVE
MONEY TO BUY A CORDLESS--

483
00:19:20,657 --> 00:19:24,194
NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO
WHERE THE REAL BARGAINS ARE,

484
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,695
ACROSS THE BORDER.

485
00:19:25,762 --> 00:19:27,397
NO.
OH, YEAH.

486
00:19:27,463 --> 00:19:28,598
DUTY-FREE PERFUME, BEER.

487
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:31,000
CHEAP SHOES, CHEAP SHIRTS,
CHEAP DRILLS.

488
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:34,537
GOD BLESS AMERICA.

489
00:19:34,604 --> 00:19:37,040
GOD SAVE AMERICA.

490
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:42,912
WANT TO TALK TO YOU YOUNG KIDS,
IF ANY OF YOU ARE WATCHING.

491
00:19:42,979 --> 00:19:44,781
I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU GUYS.

492
00:19:44,847 --> 00:19:47,417
GOTTA BE TOUGH
BEING A KID THESE DAYS.

493
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:50,753
AS SOON AS YOU FIND
SOMETHING COOL TO WEAR OR DO,

494
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,289
SOME DORKY PARENT
DOES THE SAME THING

495
00:19:53,356 --> 00:19:55,458
'CAUSE IT MAKES THEM
FEEL YOUNG.

496
00:19:55,525 --> 00:19:58,394
MAYBE IT'S WEARING
YOUR CAP BACKWARDS

497
00:19:58,461 --> 00:20:02,832
OR YOUR PANTS INSIDE-OUT,
OR MAYBE THAT MOSH-PIT THING.

498
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:05,034
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT IT IS.

499
00:20:05,101 --> 00:20:08,671
PARENTS GET INTO IT
AND THAT MAKES IT UNCOOL.

500
00:20:08,738 --> 00:20:11,474
HOW MUST YOU FEEL WHEN
A SENIOR CITIZEN

501
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,409
CAN DO IT BETTER THAN YOU?

502
00:20:13,476 --> 00:20:14,911
YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY?

503
00:20:14,978 --> 00:20:18,114
YOU GOT TO GET INTO
WEIRDER AND WEIRDER MUSIC,

504
00:20:18,181 --> 00:20:20,516
WEARING WILDER
AND WILDER CLOTHES,

505
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,453
AND DOING STRANGER
AND STRANGER BEHAVIOUR.

506
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:26,055
EVENTUALLY YOU'LL BE
SO FAR OUT THERE

507
00:20:26,122 --> 00:20:29,292
THAT NO ADULT IN
THEIR RIGHT MIND WILL TRY IT.

508
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:31,461
BUT DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP.

509
00:20:31,527 --> 00:20:34,764
ADULTS IN THEIR RIGHT MIND
ARE A MINORITY.

510
00:20:41,037 --> 00:20:42,371
(Grunting)

511
00:20:42,438 --> 00:20:43,873
OW, OW.

512
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,342
IS THAT YOU, UNCLE RED,

513
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:48,344
OR THE PATH OF THE TORNADO?

514
00:20:48,411 --> 00:20:52,148
HAROLD, YOU MISSED OUT ON
SOME GREAT BARGAINS.

515
00:20:52,215 --> 00:20:54,484
HOW DID YOU GET
ACROSS THE BORDER?

516
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,453
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ALLOWED
$300 WORTH OF STUFF?

517
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,489
WE NEVER GOT TO THE BORDER.

518
00:20:59,555 --> 00:21:02,024
OH, THE LAWN SALES.

519
00:21:02,091 --> 00:21:03,292
MAN!

520
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,061
UNBELIEVABLE.

521
00:21:05,128 --> 00:21:07,196
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE WHEEL.

522
00:21:07,263 --> 00:21:09,999
I GOT THREE MORE LIKE IT
FOR 20 BUCKS.

523
00:21:10,066 --> 00:21:11,868
THINK OF THE STUFF
WE CAN MAKE.

524
00:21:11,934 --> 00:21:14,303
COFFEE TABLE, COAT RACK,

525
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,472
LAZY SUSAN, YOU KNOW.

526
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:19,809
WHERE HAVE YOU SEEN
A LAWN CHAIR FOR FIVE BUCKS.

527
00:21:19,876 --> 00:21:22,512
OH, BOY, THERE YOU GO.

528
00:21:22,578 --> 00:21:24,280
THIS IS JUST ME THINKING.

529
00:21:24,347 --> 00:21:25,848
I'M THINKING THERE.

530
00:21:25,915 --> 00:21:28,184
DID YOU HAPPEN TO PICK UP

531
00:21:28,251 --> 00:21:31,687
A CORDLESS DRILL
FOR JUNIOR SINGLETON?

532
00:21:31,754 --> 00:21:33,289
THINK BACK.

533
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:35,858
I GOT ONE FOR 10 BUCKS.

534
00:21:35,925 --> 00:21:37,093
LOOK AT THAT.

535
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:40,563
CORDLESS, VARIABLE SPEED,
REVERSIBLE,

536
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,064
AND NEVER NEEDS CHARGING.

537
00:21:42,131 --> 00:21:44,700
OK, FINE,
BUT I'M KEEPING THIS ONE.

538
00:21:44,767 --> 00:21:46,202
I LOVE THIS.

539
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:47,737
I'VE BEEN DRILLING.

540
00:21:47,803 --> 00:21:49,905
SANDING AND BORING ALL DAY.

541
00:21:49,972 --> 00:21:53,142
HAROLD, YOU'VE BEEN BORING
ALL YOUR LIFE.

542
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:54,710
A-HA-HA.

543
00:21:54,777 --> 00:21:57,980
(Imitating John Wayne):
I'VE FIXED 9,000 THINGS

544
00:21:58,047 --> 00:21:59,148
WITH THIS TODAY.

545
00:21:59,215 --> 00:22:00,750
HA HA HA.

546
00:22:00,816 --> 00:22:02,718
I WOULD HAVE FIXED MORE, BUT

547
00:22:02,785 --> 00:22:04,153
I RAN OUT OF SCREWS.

548
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,489
I KNOW WHERE
WE CAN GET 'EM CHEAP.

549
00:22:06,555 --> 00:22:08,257
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!

550
00:22:08,324 --> 00:22:09,659
DON'T YOU DO THAT!

551
00:22:09,725 --> 00:22:10,960
(Possum
squeal)

552
00:22:11,027 --> 00:22:13,095
IT'S TIME FOR THE MEETING.

553
00:22:13,162 --> 00:22:16,532
I'LL SEE YOU DOWNSTAIRS THEN,
MR. BARGOON.

554
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:19,668
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE,
MR. TOTAL-GOON.

555
00:22:19,735 --> 00:22:22,204
(Laughing)

556
00:22:22,271 --> 00:22:26,275
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,
I'LL BE HOME AFTER THE MEETING,

557
00:22:26,342 --> 00:22:29,678
UNLESS I GO BY A YARD SALE
OR A GARAGE SALE...

558
00:22:29,745 --> 00:22:31,180
OR A DUMP.

559
00:22:31,247 --> 00:22:32,681
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

560
00:22:32,748 --> 00:22:36,185
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND HAROLD AND THE GANG,

561
00:22:36,252 --> 00:22:39,021
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

562
00:22:39,088 --> 00:22:43,526
(Applause and cheering)

563
00:22:43,592 --> 00:22:46,862
(Possum squeal)

564
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:49,064
(Red): GET OFF THERE, HAROLD.

565
00:22:49,131 --> 00:22:51,634
(Harold): EVERYBODY
TO THEIR SEATS.

566
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,037
HE'LL GET GROUCHY
IF YOU'RE NOT IN YOUR SEATS.

567
00:22:55,104 --> 00:22:56,906
YOU DON'T WANNA SEE THAT.

568
00:22:56,972 --> 00:23:00,075
HIS BEARD ALL FOAMY
AND CRUMBS--

569
00:23:00,142 --> 00:23:01,644
OH, HE'S HERE.

570
00:23:01,911 --> 00:23:03,279
ALL RISE.

571
00:23:03,345 --> 00:23:05,781
WHAT ARE YOU SITTING DOWN?

572
00:23:07,216 --> 00:23:11,654
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

573
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,155
(Red): SIT DOWN.

574
00:23:13,222 --> 00:23:15,124
ALL THESE YEARS

575
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:17,126
I'VE BEEN WAITING
TO DRILL HAROLD.
