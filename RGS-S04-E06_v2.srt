LOT ABOUT PEOPLE

HANG ON TO OVER THE YEARS:

REMIND THEM OF EVENTS:

MAYBE A BROKEN LIGHTER,
PERHAPS A BULLET CASING.

11

ONE OF THE MAIN DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN

IS WHAT THEY HAVE
IN THEIR DRAWERS.

103
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,239
WHERE IS HE GOING
TO PUT HIS COMPUTER?

00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:41,373

GIVES ME ANOTHER IDEA.

00:06:09,768 --> 00:06:11,670
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
SOME TYPE OF A
FLAT SURFACE

MORE SPECIFICALLY
THIS DOOR.

129
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,780
NOW YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO PUT LONGER
ROPES ON THE SWING

00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,350
AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO CUT A SQUARE HOLE IN
THE BOTTOM OF THE DOOR.

I ALREADY MADE A PILOT
HOLE WITH MY LEG.

132
00:06:33,525 --> 00:06:35,994
SO YOU TAKE THE EXTRA
ROPE THAT'S MOUNTED
TO THE SWING

133
00:06:35,994 --> 00:06:38,463
AND YOU TIE ONE TO
EACH SIDE OF THE DOOR,

134
00:06:38,463 --> 00:06:40,265
THAT WAY THE KID CAN
BE SITTING THERE

135
00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:42,401
SWINGING HIS WAY
THROUGH HIS A, B, CS,

136
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:45,537
AND SUDDENLY THE
TEACHER SAYS OKAY
TIME FOR DESK WORK,

137
00:06:45,537 --> 00:06:48,040
NO PROBLEM.

138
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,542

ADJUSTABLE TO WHATEVER
HEIGHT YOU WANT

139
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:53,145
DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH
WEIGHT YOU PUT
ON THE SEAT.

140
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:55,314
YOU CAN EVEN MAKE
YOURSELF INVISIBLE,

141
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,849
THAT WAY YOU CAN MAKE
FACES AT THE TEACHER.

142
00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:02,955
FINALLY A DESK THAT
REFLECTS THE ATTITUDE
OF TODAY'S TEENAGERS.

143
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:05,724
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

144
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:07,859
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

RED GREEN:
STAY TUNED.

148
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:19,638
BILL IS GOING TO TURN
HIMSELF INTO AN 18-WHEELER

149
00:07:19,638 --> 00:07:21,506
AS PART OF HIS FUN
WITH RUBBER HOBBY

150
00:07:21,506 --> 00:07:24,443
AND HAROLD IS GOING
TO GIVE ME A LIFT
INTO TOWN.

151
00:07:26,611 --> 00:07:29,915
I KNOW A LOT OF YOU
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE STUCK
IN SOME LOUSY JOBS OUT THERE

152
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:32,084
AND YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE TURNING 40

153
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,986
STILL ASKING PEOPLE IF
THEY WANT FRIES WITH THAT.

154
00:07:34,986 --> 00:07:36,788
BUT THE PATH TO A
BETTER CAREER

155
00:07:36,788 --> 00:07:39,558
IS NOT TO SCREW UP
THE JOB YOU HAVE NOW.

156
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:41,927
FOR EXAMPLE, I WAS IN
ONE OF THEM FAST FOOD
PLACES THE OTHER DAY

157
00:07:41,927 --> 00:07:44,596
AND AFTER I PLACED MY
ORDER FOR THE THIRD TIME,

158
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:46,932
IT STRUCK ME THAT THAT
KID BEHIND THE COUNTER

159
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:49,434
WAS PROBABLY NEVER GOING
TO BE RUNNING THE COMPANY.

160
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:51,036
THEY EVEN HAD THE
MANAGER HELPING HIM.

161
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:53,572
I COULD TELL SHE WAS
A MANAGER BECAUSE SHE
WAS 18 MONTHS OLDER

162
00:07:53,572 --> 00:07:56,041
AND DIDN'T HAVE TO
WEAR THE PAPER HAT.

163
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,843
I MADE THE MISTAKE
OF HANDING THEM
A $20 BILL

164
00:07:57,843 --> 00:07:59,878
JUST AS THE COMPUTER
WENT DOWN,

165
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:02,848
WHICH MEANT THEY HAD
NO IDEA HOW MUCH
CHANGE TO GIVE ME.

166
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:04,316
I JUST KNEW I WAS
LOOKING AT TWO KIDS

167
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:06,518
WHO HAD SAT IN GRADE 7
MATH CLASS THINKING,

168
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:09,187
HEY, WE'RE NEVER
GOING TO NEED TO
KNOW THIS STUFF.

169
00:08:09,187 --> 00:08:12,757
THEY STARED AT THAT TWENTY
LIKE THEY WERE LOOKING FOR
OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS.

170
00:08:12,757 --> 00:08:16,361
MY POINT IS, IF YOU
WON'T OR CAN'T DO
THE JOB YOU HAVE,

171
00:08:16,361 --> 00:08:19,464
NO EMPLOYER IS GOING
TO PROMOTE YOU TO THE
BETTER JOB YOU WANT.

172
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:21,867
I MEAN, HAROLD HAS
BEEN MY PRODUCER
AND DIRECTOR

173
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:25,570
FOR FIVE YEARS IN A ROW,
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?

174
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,039
I'M WINSTON ROTHCHILD
REMINDING YOU,

175
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:29,774
IF THE NEIGHBOURS
ARE COMPLAINING

176
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:31,543
BETTER START
DRAINING.

177
00:08:31,543 --> 00:08:35,814
CALL 1-800-555-SUCK.

178
00:08:35,814 --> 00:08:38,183
WELL, THIS PROJECT TO
HAVE POSSUM LAKE
PUBLIC SCHOOL

179
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:39,851
DECLARED A HISTORICAL
SITE HAS BROUGHT OUT

180
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:41,453
THE COMMUNITY
SPIRIT IN EVERYBODY.

181
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:43,388
I'M ON THE COMMITTEE
TO ORGANIZE THE
SCHOOL REUNION.

182
00:08:43,388 --> 00:08:45,824
WE'RE GOING TO GET
EVERYBODY BACK WHO'S
EVER WENT THERE BEFORE

183
00:08:45,824 --> 00:08:49,561
AND WE'RE HOPING THAT
THE FIVE WHO ACTUALLY
GRADUATED CAN MAKE IT, TOO.

184
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:51,496
HOW ARE YOU
GETTING IN TOUCH
WITH EVERYBODY?

185
00:08:51,496 --> 00:08:54,966
WELL, WE FIGURE THE PAROLE
BOARD IS THE BEST SOURCE
OF INFORMATION.

186
00:08:54,966 --> 00:09:00,171
SO I GUESS YOU'RE SENDING
OUT INVITATIONS MAINLY TO
NO FIXED ADDRESS, ARE YOU?

187
00:09:00,171 --> 00:09:02,073
NO. YOU KNOW WE FIGURE
ANYONE WHO WENT
TO THAT SCHOOL,

188
00:09:02,073 --> 00:09:04,209
THEIR READING COMPREHENSION,
YOU KNOW, MIGHT BE
IN DOUBT.

189
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:06,811
SO I'M ACTUALLY
I'M GOING TO PHONE
EVERYBODY DIRECTLY.

190
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:10,849
IT'S SCARY THE TYPE
OF PEOPLE THEY ALLOW
TO HAVE PHONES.

191
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:13,084
BUT, ANYWAY, I JUST TOLD
THEM MEET AT THE SCHOOL
NEXT SATURDAY

192
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:14,986
YEAH, I HOPE WE CAN
FIGURE OUT WHERE THE
SCHOOL IS GOING TO BE

193
00:09:14,986 --> 00:09:16,588
BECAUSE YOU KNOW
WE GOT TO MOVE IT.

194
00:09:16,588 --> 00:09:18,823
AND OF COURSE ONCE THAT
WORD GOT OUT THAT WE'RE
MOVING THE SCHOOL,

195
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:20,525
EVERYBODY WANTED TO
COMPETE FOR THAT JOB,

196
00:09:20,525 --> 00:09:22,861
SO GOT THEY GOT THEIR TRUCKS
OUT AND THEY STARTED
SHOWING OFF, YOU KNOW.

197
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:26,297
AND JUNIOR SINGLETON
THREW A CHAIN AROUND
THE POST OFFICE

198
00:09:26,297 --> 00:09:28,800
AND PULLED HER RIGHT
OFF THE FOUNDATION.

199
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,002
AND BUSTER HADFIELD
DRAGGED THE TOWN CLOCK

200
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:33,004
FROM ONE END OF THE
STREET TO THE OTHER.

201
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:36,107
MADE PERFECT
TIME ON THAT, TOO.

202
00:09:36,107 --> 00:09:38,443
SO WHO GOT THE HONOURS
OF MOVING THE SCHOOL?

203
00:09:38,443 --> 00:09:40,512
WELL, I THINK IT WENT
TO JUNIOR SINGLETON

204
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:43,548
BECAUSE HE HAD PULLED
THE DRUGSTORE TWO
AND A HALF MILES.

205
00:09:43,548 --> 00:09:45,250
EVERYBODY WAS PRETTY
IMPRESSED WITH THAT

206
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,552
EXCEPT FOR THE
DRUGGIST OF COURSE.

207
00:09:47,552 --> 00:09:49,354
SO NOW THE NEXT
MAJOR DEAL IS

208
00:09:49,354 --> 00:09:50,922
WHO GETS TO KEEP
ALL THE TREASURES

209
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:53,224
THAT ARE IN THE BASEMENT
UNDERNEATH THE SCHOOL?

210
00:09:53,224 --> 00:09:54,592
UNDERNEATH THE SCHOOL?

211
00:09:54,592 --> 00:09:57,028
OH, HAROLD, THERE'S GOT
TO BE A TON OF STUFF
UNDER THERE, EH?

212
00:09:57,028 --> 00:10:01,232
OLD PENS, INK WELLS,
SHOES, BUTTONS,

213
00:10:01,232 --> 00:10:04,702
GLASS EYES,
LOST MARBLES, HAROLD.

214
00:10:04,702 --> 00:10:08,573
A LOT OF THE TEACHERS
LOST THEIR MARBLES
IN THAT SCHOOL.

215
00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:10,942
ANY OF YOUR STUFF
GOING TO BE UNDER
THAT SCHOOL?

216
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:12,310
A LOT OF HOMEWORK.

217
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,612
I USED TO JAM THAT DOWN
THROUGH THE HOLES IN
THE FLOORBOARDS.

218
00:10:14,612 --> 00:10:17,215
I TOLD THE TEACHER
THAT THE DOG ATE
IT, YOU KNOW.

219
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,450
BUT IF MY DOG HAD EATEN
AS MUCH HOMEWORK AS
I SAID HE DID,

220
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:23,354
HE'D BE PASSING
FIRE LOGS.

221
00:10:25,056 --> 00:10:30,328
DON'T ADJUST YOUR SET,
THE SHOW'S SUPPOSED
TO LOOK LIKE THIS.

222
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,669
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU
DON'T GET A BETTER
VEHICLE UNCLE RED,

223
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:40,471
YOU KNOW LIKE ONE OF THOSE
NEW KIND OF VANS THEY'RE
BUILDING THESE DAYS,

224
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:42,340
YOU KNOW THE KIND
THAT ACTUALLY RUN.

225
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,775
CAN'T AFFORD
IT, HAROLD.

226
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:45,677
JUST BORROW THE MONEY
FROM THE BANK.

227
00:10:45,677 --> 00:10:48,212
YEAH, BUT ONCE YOU ADD
ON THE INTEREST AND
THE SERVICE CHARGE

228
00:10:48,212 --> 00:10:52,183
AND THE HUMILIATION
OF HAVING TO TELL SOME
DOLT WHY YOU'RE BROKE,

229
00:10:52,183 --> 00:10:53,651
THAT COULD BE A
NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE.

230
00:10:53,651 --> 00:11:01,025
YEAH, I GO THROUGH THAT
EVERY WEEK TRYING TO
GET MY ALLOWANCE.

231
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:04,228
YOU KNOW, BUT YOU'D ALWAYS
HAVE THE NEW VEHICLE
TO BORROW AGAINST,

232
00:11:04,228 --> 00:11:06,097
YOU KNOW, YOU'D ALWAYS
HAVE THAT AS BACK UP.

233
00:11:06,097 --> 00:11:08,032
THE BANK DOESN'T
WANT MY VAN, HAROLD.

234
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:11,302
THEY'RE IN THE MONEY
BUSINESS, NOT THE
VEHICLE REPO BUSINESS.

235
00:11:11,302 --> 00:11:15,173
CUSTOMERS DON'T GO INTO
THE BANK TO WITHDRAW A
DOOR FROM A HYUNDAI PONY.

236
00:11:15,173 --> 00:11:17,041
THEY WON'T REPOSSESS
IT IF YOU KEEP THE
PAYMENTS UP.

237
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:20,211
YOU CAN DO THAT.
MAYBE I CAN,
MAYBE I CAN'T,

238
00:11:20,211 --> 00:11:22,480
BUT WORRYING ABOUT
IT WILL CRAMP
MY LIFESTYLE.

239
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,083
YEAH, BUT YOU'D BE
RIDING AROUND IN A
LOT NICER VEHICLE.

240
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,519
WITH THE HITCHHIKING I CAN
BE IN A NICER VEHICLE
EVERY COUPLE OF HOURS

241
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:31,556
AND IT'S FREE.
YEAH, I GUESS SO, YEAH.

242
00:11:31,556 --> 00:11:33,891
I SUPPOSE IF YOU
DON'T COUNT THE
LOSS OF SHOES,

243
00:11:33,891 --> 00:11:37,061
LOSS OF DIGNITY,
SUNSTROKE AND
OTHER RELATED INJURY.

244
00:11:37,061 --> 00:11:39,897
DROP IT, HAROLD, OR
YOU'LL BE A RELATED
INJURY

245
00:11:39,897 --> 00:11:42,700
GONNA BE?

246
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:45,369
WELL, HERE WE ARE WITH
THIS WEEK'S BOATING TIP

247
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:47,004
WITH GLEN BRACKSTON OF
BRACKSTON'S MARINA.

248
00:11:47,004 --> 00:11:48,439
HOW ARE YOU
TODAY, GLEN?

249
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:51,843
NOT BAD AT ALL, RED,
FOR A GUY WHO'S HAD
TWO HEART ATTACKS,

250
00:11:51,843 --> 00:11:55,613
BLOWN OUT GALL BLADDER,
DOUBLE HERNIA,

251
00:11:55,613 --> 00:11:57,748
PLUS I GOT THESE
BAD ANKLES, TOO.

252
00:11:57,748 --> 00:11:59,951
I FIND THEY CAN BE
LIFE-THREATENING
IF, YOU KNOW,

253
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:02,987
I COULDN'T GET
TO A PHONE OR A
RESTAURANT OR SOMETHING.

254
00:12:02,987 --> 00:12:05,323
HOW ABOUT THE BOATING
TIP TODAY, GLEN?

255
00:12:05,323 --> 00:12:06,791
WELL, ACTUALLY, RED,
IT'S A SAFETY TIP.

256
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,526
OH, ALL RIGHT.
YEAH.
YEAH.

257
00:12:08,526 --> 00:12:10,494
THE PROPER WAY TO
REFUEL YOUR BOAT.

258
00:12:10,494 --> 00:12:13,764
SO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO
FIRST IS SHUT DOWN
THE ENGINE.

259
00:12:13,764 --> 00:12:15,633
YEAH, YOU'VE
DONE THAT, YEAH.

260
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:18,202
AND THEN NEXT
YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE
OFF THE GAS CAP.

261
00:12:18,202 --> 00:12:21,772
STICK THE NOZZLE
IN THERE AND
LET HER GO.
YEAH.

262
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:24,275
CAN YOU
GET THAT?

263
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:26,210
WELL, IT'S YOU'RE
DEMONSTRATION.

264
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,646
WELL, I KNOW RED
BUT I'M ALLERGIC
TO THE SMELL OF GAS.

265
00:12:28,646 --> 00:12:30,982
OH, YEAH, MY EYELIDS
WILL JUST BLOW UP
LIKE BALLOONS.

266
00:12:30,982 --> 00:12:33,117
IT'S HORRIBLE.
AND I GET THESE
BIG BLISTERS.

267
00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:36,220
ALL RIGHT, GLEN,
SPARE US THE DETAILS.

268
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,922
MAN, OH MAN, OH MAN,
OH MAN, OH MAN.

269
00:12:37,922 --> 00:12:39,757
THAT'S IT.
JUST GET THE
CAP THERE, RED.

270
00:12:39,757 --> 00:12:43,594
THANK YOU.

271
00:12:43,594 --> 00:12:45,363
THAT'S IT.
THERE WE GO.

272
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:46,731
OKAY.
STEP THREE.

273
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:50,067
EXTINGUISH ALL
OPEN FLAMES.

274
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:52,269
I GUESS THAT COULD
ACTUALLY BE STEP ONE
OR TWO, COULDN'T IT?

275
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:55,473
I THINK SO.
I'M SORRY, I SHOULD
HAVE KNOWN THAT.

276
00:12:55,473 --> 00:12:57,241
NOW WHAT DO I DO,
EASE OFF ON THE NOZZLE

277
00:12:57,241 --> 00:12:59,777
WHEN I HEAR IT
FILLING UP THERE?

278
00:12:59,777 --> 00:13:03,714
WELL YOU CAN, RED,
BUT THAT'S IF THE OWNER
OF THE BOAT IS AROUND.

279
00:13:03,714 --> 00:13:05,950
IF HE'S GONE, THEN YOU
JUST KEEP'ER GOING

280
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,753
'CAUSE YOU MAKE A COUPLE
EXTRA BUCKS EVERY FILL UP.

281
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:10,888
THERE'S A GOOD TIP FOR
YOU MARINA OPERATORS
OUT THERE.

282
00:13:10,888 --> 00:13:12,656
WELL, THAT'S
A NICE TOUCH,
YOU'RE USING OUR SHOW

283
00:13:12,656 --> 00:13:15,226
TO GIVE RIP
OFF ADVICE.
I APPRECIATE THAT.

284
00:13:15,226 --> 00:13:17,428
PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW
THIS STUFF, RED.

285
00:13:17,428 --> 00:13:19,029
I GOT TO BE A FULL
SERVICE BUSINESS

286
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:21,866
IF I'M GOING TO COMPETE
WITH THE INFORMATION
SUPER HIGHWAY.

287
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:23,467
ALL RIGHT.
I'M DONE.

288
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:28,572
THAT'S AS MUCH GAS
AS I CAN TAKE.

289
00:13:28,572 --> 00:13:30,941
BILL HAD ASKED ME TO
MEET HIM OUT ON
THE GRIDIRON

290
00:13:30,941 --> 00:13:35,246
FOR ONE OF HIS FAVOURITE
SPORTS, FOOTBALL.

291
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:39,350
OH, YEAH, YOU
LOOK GREAT, BILL.

292
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,752
WHAT AN ATHLETE.

293
00:13:41,752 --> 00:13:43,154
HE WAS ASKING FOR THAT.

294
00:13:43,154 --> 00:13:44,855
AND NOW HE TOOK
ME OVER TO THE
BLOCKING DUMMY.

295
00:13:44,855 --> 00:13:47,224
ACTUALLY THEY
GOT AT LEAST TWO
TO CHOOSE FROM THERE.

296
00:13:47,224 --> 00:13:49,260
WANTED ME
TO TRY THAT.

297
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:53,731
ONE THING I DIDN'T
REALIZE IS THAT I REALLY
WASN'T WEARING THE PADDING.

298
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:55,232
BILL IS GOING
TO SHOW OFF AGAIN.

299
00:13:55,232 --> 00:13:59,103
BACKS WAY UP, TAKES
A FULL RUN AT 'ER
AND IN HE COMES.

300
00:13:59,103 --> 00:14:01,272
WOW.
WATCH THE AIM
THERE, BILL.

301
00:14:01,272 --> 00:14:03,107
OH, GOT 'ER RIGHT
ON TOP OF THE HEAD.

302
00:14:03,107 --> 00:14:05,609
NOW, LUCKILY I HAD
TAKEN THAT ST. JOHN'S
AMBULANCE COURSE

303
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:08,612
SO I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT
TO DO WITH THIS TYPE
OF A SITUATION.

304
00:14:08,612 --> 00:14:11,582
OH, IT'S A BOY.

305
00:14:11,582 --> 00:14:14,919
AND NOW WE TRY
RUNNING THROUGH
THE TIRES HERE.

306
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:17,421
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
YOU DO SO THAT YOU WILL
BE ABLE TO RUN THROUGH TIRES.

307
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:19,823
I'VE NEVER SEEN
A FOOTBALL PLAYER
ACTUALLY RUN THROUGH TIRES,

308
00:14:19,823 --> 00:14:21,425
THAT'S A TOTAL
WASTE OF TIME,

309
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:24,828
BUT YOU GOT KNUTE
ROCKNEY HERE, WELL,
YOU DID IT YOURSELF.

310
00:14:24,828 --> 00:14:26,931
AND THEN HE COMES.
OH MY GOSH.

311
00:14:26,931 --> 00:14:27,965
LOOK AT THAT STYLE.

312
00:14:27,965 --> 00:14:29,600
LOOK OUT.
WATCH OUT.
WATCH OUT.

313
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,836
OH, OH, OH, AND HE
GOT HIMSELF ALL WOUND
UP IN THE DARN TIRES.

314
00:14:32,836 --> 00:14:34,071
THERE HE GOES.

315
00:14:34,071 --> 00:14:36,473
TAKE HIM OVER
TO THE BIG HILL,
HAVE SOME FUN.

316
00:14:36,473 --> 00:14:40,611
THAT WAS A PRETTY
NICE KICK IF I DO
SAY SO MYSELF.

317
00:14:40,611 --> 00:14:43,280
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S
NOW BILL'S TURN.

318
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,284
YEAH, GOT THE POINTED-TOED
RUNNING SHOES

319
00:14:47,284 --> 00:14:48,952
WHICH ARE NOT THAT
GREAT FOR THIS SPORT

320
00:14:48,952 --> 00:14:51,722
BUT THEY'RE OKAY
FOR KILLING BUGS IN
THE CORNER I SUPPOSE.

321
00:14:51,722 --> 00:14:54,091
AND BILL JUST HAD
A BIRTHDAY WHERE HE
GOT ALL THESE FOOTBALLS

322
00:14:54,091 --> 00:14:56,927
SO HE WAS PRETTY
DARN EXCITED.

323
00:14:56,927 --> 00:14:59,663
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT
ONE WAS THE CAKE.

324
00:14:59,663 --> 00:15:01,532
ALL RIGHT, BILL, HERE
IS A NORMAL FOOTBALL.

325
00:15:01,532 --> 00:15:03,000
SEE IF YOU CAN PUT THIS
THROUGH THE UPRIGHTS.

326
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,935
REALLY LET 'ER GO.
REALLY HIT IT.

327
00:15:04,935 --> 00:15:07,805
OH, NICE KICK,
BEAUTIFUL KICK.

328
00:15:07,805 --> 00:15:09,773
WRONG BALL, BILL.

329
00:15:09,773 --> 00:15:12,709
DON'T THINK THAT
DIDN'T HURT.

330
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:15,412
TELL YOU WHAT, BILL,
WHY DON'T I HAVE
ONE LAST KICK,

331
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:16,880
ALL RIGHT?
YOU HOLD IT FOR ME.

332
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,449
NO, NO, NO, NOT
JUST THE FINGER,
WRAP YOUR HAND,

333
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:20,050
I'M GOING TO REALLY --
WRAP YOUR HAND.

334
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,052
AND LEAN RIGHT OVER IT, BILL,
LEAN RIGHT OVER IT,

335
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:25,956
CLOSE YOUR EYES
AND MAKE A WISH.

336
00:15:25,956 --> 00:15:28,058
CHALK ONE UP FOR
THE HOME TEAM.

337
00:15:28,058 --> 00:15:29,426
RED GREEN:
STAY TUNED.

338
00:15:29,426 --> 00:15:31,128
DOUGIE FRANKLIN IS
GOING TO LAY OUT
A BIG THEORY

339
00:15:31,128 --> 00:15:34,631
AND WINSTON ROTHCHILD
IS GOING TO SUCK IT ALL UP.

340
00:15:40,504 --> 00:15:42,606
HAROLD, YOU MISSED OUT
ON THE EXCITEMENT.

341
00:15:42,606 --> 00:15:44,408
NO SOONER DID WE LIFT
UP THE SCHOOLHOUSE,

342
00:15:44,408 --> 00:15:47,678
YOU LOOK DOWN UNDER
THERE, A SKELETON
IN THE FOUNDATION.

343
00:15:47,678 --> 00:15:49,379
IT'S PROBABLY JUST ONE
OF THOSE GANGLY
WHITE SKELETONS

344
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:52,249
THAT USED TO HANG
IN THE CORNER OF
THE CLASSROOM.

345
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:54,351
YOU SHOULD TALK.

346
00:15:54,351 --> 00:15:57,187
ANYWAY, THE BIG QUESTION
NOW IS WHERE ARE WE GOING
TO PUT THE SCHOOLHOUSE.

347
00:15:57,187 --> 00:15:59,923
SOME SAY DOWN AT THE
PARK, SOME SAY UP AT
ROCK CREEK POINT.

348
00:15:59,923 --> 00:16:01,725
MAYBE WE COULD KEEP
IT HERE AT THE LODGE.

349
00:16:01,725 --> 00:16:05,095
NO, THEY'RE AFRAID
WE'LL WRECK IT BY
FIXING IT UP.

350
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:07,998
WE'RE HERE WITH
SMALL BUSINESSMAN
WINSTON ROTHCHILD

351
00:16:07,998 --> 00:16:10,334
FOR MORE OF HIS
HANDY HINTS FOR
THE ENTREPRENEUR.

352
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:13,637
LISTEN, FIRST OF ALL,
I RESENT BEING CALLED
A SMALL BUSINESSMAN.

353
00:16:13,637 --> 00:16:14,738
OH, NO, I DIDN'T
MEAN YOUR HEIGHT,

354
00:16:14,738 --> 00:16:16,573
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE
SIZE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

355
00:16:16,573 --> 00:16:20,210
I KNOW.
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH MY HEIGHT?

356
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:24,181
NO, I'M SAYING YOU'RE NOT
EXACTLY A MULTINATIONAL
CORPORATION HERE, WINSTON.

357
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:26,550
YOU'RE THE ONLY EMPLOYEE.

358
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,518
WELL, LISTEN,
MR. POSSUM,

359
00:16:28,518 --> 00:16:31,722
I MEAN JUST BECAUSE MY
CASH FLOW HAS RESTRICTED

360
00:16:31,722 --> 00:16:33,957
MY EMPLOYMENT
ACQUISITION
TIMETABLE,

361
00:16:33,957 --> 00:16:37,327
RESULTING IN
A JOB SHARING
SITUATION, I MEAN,

362
00:16:37,327 --> 00:16:39,329
THAT DON'T MEAN I'M
NOT THINKING BIG.

363
00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:41,164
BECAUSE AFTER ALL,
THINKING BIG,

364
00:16:41,164 --> 00:16:42,966
THAT'S THE SECRET TO
SUCCESS RIGHT THERE.

365
00:16:42,966 --> 00:16:47,604
I LEARNED THAT FROM
ONE OF THEM INSPIRATIONAL
TAPES, THINK BIG BY ED BIG.

366
00:16:47,604 --> 00:16:50,874
AND, YOU KNOW,
THROUGH ED I REALIZED
THAT EVENTUALLY SOMEDAY

367
00:16:50,874 --> 00:16:54,177
I COULD OWN LIKE
MY WHOLE FLEET OF
SEPTIC TANK TRAINS,

368
00:16:54,177 --> 00:16:59,216
SEPTIC SUPER TANKERS,
SUPER SONIC SEWAGE PLANES.

369
00:16:59,216 --> 00:17:01,485
SEPTIC SPACE SHUTTLES?

370
00:17:01,485 --> 00:17:04,654
YOU SEE, I PLAN
ON EXPANDING INTO
OTHER BUSINESSES

371
00:17:04,654 --> 00:17:06,957
THAT ARE SORT
OF SIMILAR IN
NATURE, EH?

372
00:17:06,957 --> 00:17:08,692
SORT OF, I
DON'T KNOW,

373
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:11,294
CAPITALIZE ON MY
EXPERIENCE AND
EXPERTISE, EH?

374
00:17:11,294 --> 00:17:14,664
COME ON!

375
00:17:14,664 --> 00:17:17,134
THAT ONE JUST DID NOT
WANT TO LET GO, EH?

376
00:17:17,134 --> 00:17:18,802
LIKE, FOR INSTANCE,
WHEN THESE GUYS

377
00:17:18,802 --> 00:17:20,937
ASKED ME TO BRING MY
TRUCK OUT EARLIER TODAY,

378
00:17:20,937 --> 00:17:23,740
YOU KNOW, TO MOVE
THE SCHOOLHOUSE.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

379
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,909
A LOT OF BUSINESS
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT THAT THAT

380
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:28,845
WAS JUST AN INCONVENIENT
ANNOYING IMPOSITION, EH?

381
00:17:28,845 --> 00:17:32,415
OH, YEAH, BUT TO ME
IT'S OH SO MUCH
MORE THAN THAT.

382
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:37,320
I LOOK AT THAT
AS A BUSINESS
OPPORTUNITY, EH?

383
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,189
SEE THE WAY
I SEE IT,

384
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:42,425
IF YOU GOT A BIG
SCHOOLHOUSE LIKE THAT
THAT YOU WANT TO MOVE.

385
00:17:42,425 --> 00:17:44,895
NO ONE HAS MOVED
SOMETHING LIKE
THAT BEFORE, RIGHT?

386
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:50,166
SO IF IT WORKS FOR ME,
ALL OF A SUDDEN I GOT
A NEW BUSINESS.

387
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:55,405
I'M INTO RENOVATIONS
AND RESTORATION, EH?
I SUPPOSE, YEAH.

388
00:17:55,405 --> 00:17:56,706
WELL, ARE YOU KIDDING?

389
00:17:56,706 --> 00:17:58,708
I MEAN, THEY SAVE
OLD BUILDINGS, RIGHT?

390
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,778
MAY AS WELL MOVE
OLD OUTHOUSES, TOO.

391
00:18:01,778 --> 00:18:04,414
YEAH, YEAH, I
GUESS SO, YEAH.

392
00:18:04,414 --> 00:18:10,253
YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
WE COULD BE SITTING
ON A FORTUNE.

393
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:11,488
OKAY.

394
00:18:11,488 --> 00:18:13,056
WELCOME TO THE EXPERT
PORTION OF THE SHOW.

395
00:18:13,056 --> 00:18:14,958
THIS WEEK CLAIMING
TO BE EXPERTS WITH
MY UNCLE RED

396
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:18,395
ARE THE FRANKLIN
BROTHERS, DOUGIE
AND BEN.

397
00:18:18,395 --> 00:18:24,234
[ APPLAUSE ]

398
00:18:24,234 --> 00:18:26,903
ALL RIGHT.
HERE IS THE
FIRST QUESTION:

399
00:18:26,903 --> 00:18:30,340
DEAR EXPERT, IF YOU
WERE WASHED UP ON
A DESERT ISLAND,

400
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,676
WHO WOULD YOU WANT
TO HAVE WITH YOU?

401
00:18:32,676 --> 00:18:34,644
BOY, THAT'S A
TOUGH ONE, HAROLD.

402
00:18:34,644 --> 00:18:38,481
YOU WOULD WANT SOMEBODY WHO
WAS GOOD WITH SURVIVAL
STUFF, YOU KNOW?

403
00:18:38,481 --> 00:18:41,284
YEAH, AND HAD
WILDERNESS SKILLS.

404
00:18:41,284 --> 00:18:44,120
THAT WOULD BE GOOD.
OR SOMEBODY WHO WOULD
KEEP A COOL HEAD

405
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:50,026
IN WHAT I CALL YOUR
CSS OR YOUR CRISIS
SITUATION SCENARIO.

406
00:18:50,026 --> 00:18:52,862
WELL THEN I WOULD
HAVE TO GO WITH
GILLIGAN

407
00:18:52,862 --> 00:18:57,100
BECAUSE LIKE HE WAS ON
THAT ISLAND FOR LIKE
THREE YEARS AND --

408
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,103
AND -- AND LIKE HE
BUILT ALL THEM SHELTERS

409
00:19:00,103 --> 00:19:04,974
AND THERE WAS LIKE --
YOU KNOW, IT WAS LIKE
A BAMBOO SUB-DIVISION.

410
00:19:04,974 --> 00:19:07,644
EXCUSE ME, THAT WAS JUST
A TV SHOW THOUGH,
MR. FRANKLIN.

411
00:19:07,644 --> 00:19:10,146
I MEAN, GILLIGAN REALLY
DIDN'T BUILD ALL
THOSE SHELTERS.

412
00:19:10,146 --> 00:19:13,216
YOU ARE SOME
KIND OF IDIOT.

413
00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:17,053
THE PROFESSOR
BUILT THEM.

414
00:19:17,053 --> 00:19:20,223
YEAH, I GOT TO GO --
I GOT TO GO WITH
DOUGIE ON THIS ONE.

415
00:19:20,223 --> 00:19:21,691
EVERY TIME THEY
TRIED TO ESCAPE,

416
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:24,060
GILLIGAN ALWAYS WAS
THE ONE SCREWING IT UP.

417
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,463
I WOULD THINK
THE GUY YOU WOULD
WANT ON YOUR TEAM

418
00:19:27,463 --> 00:19:30,300
WHEN YOU'RE IN ONE OF
YOUR CRISIS SITUATION
SCENARIOS

419
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,468
WOULD BE SOMEBODY
LIKE THE PROFESSOR.

420
00:19:32,468 --> 00:19:35,738
I MEAN, HE WAS CLOSE
TO A MECHANICAL GENIUS
THAT FELLOW, YOU KNOW.

421
00:19:35,738 --> 00:19:38,942
REMEMBER THAT RECORD
PLAYER HE BUILT?

422
00:19:38,942 --> 00:19:41,244
IT HAD -- WELL,
REMEMBER IT?

423
00:19:41,244 --> 00:19:43,479
IT WAS BETTER THAN THE
ONE THEY HAD ON THE
FLINTSTONES,

424
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:47,617
YOU KNOW, THAT HAD
THAT BIRD WITH THE
BEAK THAT WENT DOWN

425
00:19:47,617 --> 00:19:51,187
AND AFTER THE RECORD
WAS DONE IT DID THAT

426
00:19:51,187 --> 00:19:54,490
"IT'S A LIVING."
REMEMBER THAT?

427
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,359
IT WAS MUCH
BETTER THAN THAT.

428
00:19:56,359 --> 00:20:00,830
I AM NOT AN IDIOT.

429
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,865
IT WAS GILLIGAN'S
ISLAND, OKAY,

430
00:20:02,865 --> 00:20:04,567
IT WAS ABOUT

COMING UP WITH
THESE CRAZY PLANS

AND EVERYTHING
WOULD GO WRONG

00:20:09,172 --> 00:20:11,941
AND THEN EVERYBODY
WOULD FEEL SORRY FOR HIM.

WANT IN THE WILDERNESS
