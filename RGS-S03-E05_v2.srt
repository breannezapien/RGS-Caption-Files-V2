WHAT COULD HAPPEN,

145
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:10,282
THE FUNNY THING IS WE WERE

146
00:04:10,282 --> 00:04:11,484
ACTUALLY GOING TO THROW THIS

147
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:12,685
BARBEQUE INTO THE LAKE BUT

148
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,019
WITH OURSELVES ATTACHED TO IT,

149
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:16,055
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO TURN

150
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:17,089
THIS PROPANE BARBEQUE INTO

151
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,958
A FULL SET OF SCUBA GEAR.

152
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,993
ALL RIGHT STEP ONE,

153
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:23,429
DISASSEMBLE THE UNIT

154
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:34,573
INTO ITS INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS.

155
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:35,741
YUP, OXIDATION IS

156
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:38,244
A WONDERFUL THING ISN'T IT?

157
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:39,178
ALL RIGHT STEP 2,

158
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:43,482
DISCONNECT THE PROPANE TANK.

159
00:04:43,482 --> 00:04:44,383
NOW THE CONNECTOR ON THESE

160
00:04:44,383 --> 00:04:46,018
UNITS IS LEFT HAND THREAD,

161
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:48,387
SO TO LOOSEN THEM YOU GOT

162
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:51,090
TO TURN THEM TO THE RIGHT,

163
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:51,824
YOU CAN LOOSEN THEM BY TURNING

164
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,792
THEM TO THE LEFT IF YOU'RE

165
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:55,661
THE SIZE OF MOOSE THOMPSON

166
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:56,362
BUT IT WON'T EVER GO BACK

167

TOGETHER AGAIN.

168
00:04:58,998 --> 00:04:59,832
NOW ONCE YOU GOT THE HOSE

169
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,500
OUT OF THERE YOU MIGHT

170
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,268
JUST WANT TO ABANDON THE

171
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,502

00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,802
TO BE A DRIVE-BY SHOOTING.

675
00:20:05,802 --> 00:20:07,370
DESPITE WHAT YOU SEE

676
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,705
ON TELEVISION, MOST CRIMINALS

677
00:20:08,705 --> 00:20:09,439
EITHER GET CAUGHT OR KILLED

678
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:10,340
OR THEY HAVE TO CHANGE THEIR

679
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,174
IDENTITY AND MOVE TO A COUNTRY

680
00:20:11,174 --> 00:20:12,075
WHERE THERE'S NOTHING

681
00:20:12,075 --> 00:20:13,876
WORTH STEALING.

682
00:20:13,876 --> 00:20:14,844
SO I'M ASKING YOU TO JUST

683
00:20:14,844 --> 00:20:17,046
SAY NO TO ASSAULT,

684
00:20:17,046 --> 00:20:18,881
BREAK AND ENTER, ARSON,

685
00:20:18,881 --> 00:20:22,218
MURDER, THEFT, DRUG TRAFFICKING

686
00:20:22,218 --> 00:20:24,787
AND OH YEAH, REAL ESTATE SALES.

687
00:20:25,855 --> 00:20:26,856
>>RED: JOSHUA TWO FEATHERS

688
00:20:26,856 --> 00:20:28,157
IS A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER

689
00:20:28,157 --> 00:20:29,225
ON THE RESERVE NEXT DOOR

690
00:20:29,225 --> 00:20:30,326
TO THE LODGE AND I THOUGHT

691
00:20:30,326 --> 00:20:31,194
HE MIGHT HAVE SOME ADVICE

692
00:20:31,194 --> 00:20:31,994
ABOUT THE UNDERGROUND

693
00:20:31,994 --> 00:20:33,629
PARKING LOT.

694
00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:34,764
>>JOSHUA: THIS WAS HANDED

695
00:20:34,764 --> 00:20:37,266
DOWN TO ME BY MY FATHER.

696
00:20:37,266 --> 00:20:38,034
>>RED: WOW IT'S LIKE AN

697
00:20:38,034 --> 00:20:39,569
INDIAN LEGEND OR SOMETHING.

698
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:42,138
>>JOSHUA: THIS IS A GEOLOGICAL

699
00:20:42,138 --> 00:20:42,972
SURVEY OF THE WATER TABLE

00:20:42,972 --> 00:20:45,508
DRAINAGE PATTERNS.

701
00:20:45,508 --> 00:20:47,076
NOW YOU SEE HERE HOW THE

702
00:20:47,076 --> 00:20:47,810
WATER COMES CLOSE TO

703
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:48,611
GROUND LEVEL?

704
00:20:48,611 --> 00:20:49,378
>>RED: YEAH.

705
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:50,246
>>JOSHUA: YOU COULDN'T DIG

706

707
00:20:51,114 --> 00:20:52,648
WITHOUT HITTING WATER,

708
00:20:52,648 --> 00:20:53,449
FORGET THE UNDERGROUND

709
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:54,884
PARKING LOT RED UNLESS YOU

710
00:20:54,884 --> 00:20:57,420
CAN CONVERT IT TO A CARWASH.

711
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,154
>>RED: WELL ARE YOU SURE

712
00:20:58,154 --> 00:20:59,422
THE CHART IS ACCURATE JOSHUA?

713
00:20:59,422 --> 00:21:00,623
I MEAN I'D HATE TO CHANGE ALL

714
00:21:00,623 --> 00:21:03,159
OUR PLANS JUST BECAUSE OF SOME

715
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:04,160
OLD PIECE OF PAPER AND WHAT

716
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,094
IT HAS TO SAY.

717
00:21:05,094 --> 00:21:05,695
>>JOSHUA: CAREFUL WHAT YOU

718
00:21:05,695 --> 00:21:06,562
SAY RED, I WON'T LET YOU

719
00:21:06,562 --> 00:21:08,331
DISHONOUR MY FATHER,

720
00:21:08,331 --> 00:21:09,232
HE HAD A P.H.D. IN

721
00:21:09,232 --> 00:21:10,867
URBAN PLANNING.

722
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,245
>>RED: WELL JUST LIKE

723
00:21:22,245 --> 00:21:23,579
I TOLD THEM, THE DARN PARKING

724
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:25,481
LOT ALL FLOODED THERE

725
00:21:25,481 --> 00:21:26,282
AND 14 CARS UP TO THEIR

726
00:21:26,282 --> 00:21:27,350
DOOR HANDLES IN WELL WATER

727
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,919
AND I'LL TELL YOU BY THE TIME

728
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,220
THOSE SEATS GET SATURATED

729
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,788
THERE'LL BE MORE MOLD

730
00:21:32,788 --> 00:21:33,556
AROUND HERE THAN IN

731
00:21:33,556 --> 00:21:37,994
A BACHELOR'S FRIDGE.

732
00:21:37,994 --> 00:21:38,761
>>HAROLD: EXCUSE ME UNCLE RED,

733
00:21:38,761 --> 00:21:40,062
WHAT ABOUT THE POSSUM VAN?

734
00:21:40,062 --> 00:21:40,763
YOU WEREN'T CRAZY ENOUGH LIKE

735
00:21:40,763 --> 00:21:41,597
TO PARK THE POSSUM VAN

736
00:21:41,597 --> 00:21:42,865
IN THERE WERE YOU?

737
00:21:42,865 --> 00:21:43,799
>>RED: OH NO, NO, NO HAROLD,

738
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,735
TRIED TO BUT SHE'S JUST

739
00:21:45,735 --> 00:21:47,036
A LITTLE TAD HIGH THERE AND

740
00:21:47,036 --> 00:21:47,770
SHE KIND OF WEDGED INTO

741
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,372
THE ENTRANCE YOU KNOW,

742
00:21:49,372 --> 00:21:50,673
SO THAT WAS A LIFESAVER

743
00:21:50,673 --> 00:21:51,774
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS OF

744
00:21:51,774 --> 00:21:52,942
COURSE PREVENTED THE OTHERS

745
00:21:52,942 --> 00:21:53,976
FROM GETTING IN AND GETTING

746
00:21:53,976 --> 00:21:55,111
THEIR CARS AND I NEVER WOULD

747
00:21:55,111 --> 00:21:56,512
HAVE GUESSED THE SHORT TEMPER

748
00:21:56,512 --> 00:22:00,082
ON SOME OF THESE LODGE MEMBERS.

749
00:22:00,082 --> 00:22:01,017
BUT IT'LL WORK OUT OKAY,

750
00:22:01,017 --> 00:22:01,951
THEN WE GOT THE IDEA THAT

751
00:22:01,951 --> 00:22:02,852
YOU KNOW IF WE COULD RAISE

752
00:22:02,852 --> 00:22:05,054
THE WATER PRESSURE,

753
00:22:05,054 --> 00:22:05,888
MAYBE WE COULD JUST POP

754
00:22:05,888 --> 00:22:07,923
THE VAN OUT OF THERE.

755
00:22:07,923 --> 00:22:08,991
SO WE STARTED THINKING ABOUT

756
00:22:08,991 --> 00:22:10,393
THE WATER TABLE AND SO ON

757
00:22:10,393 --> 00:22:11,394
AND WE FIGURED WE'D GET

758
00:22:11,394 --> 00:22:12,461
MOOSE THOMPSON TO CANNONBALL

759
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:14,964
DOWN THE WELL AND I THINK

760
00:22:14,964 --> 00:22:16,932
IT WOULD OF WORKED HAROLD,

761
00:22:16,932 --> 00:22:18,501
BUT WELL WE FORGET TO TAKE

762
00:22:18,501 --> 00:22:20,770
THE BUCKET OUT FIRST AND

763
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,537
I THINK WE SHOULD OF GREASED

764
00:22:21,537 --> 00:22:22,238
THE SIDES BECAUSE HE SEIZED

765
00:22:22,238 --> 00:22:26,042
UP ABOUT 30 FEET DOWN.

766
00:22:26,042 --> 00:22:26,742
WE'LL GET HIM OUT,

767
00:22:26,742 --> 00:22:27,643
WE'LL JUST POUR SOME BACON

768
00:22:27,643 --> 00:22:29,211
FAT DOWN THE WALLS OVER THERE

769
00:22:29,211 --> 00:22:30,346
AND WINCH HIM UP ON THE ROPE,

770
00:22:30,346 --> 00:22:31,147
BUT HE'S GOT TO TAKE THOSE

771
00:22:31,147 --> 00:22:32,548
SPLINTERS OUT ON HIS OWN.

772
00:22:32,548 --> 00:22:33,449
>>HAROLD: OKAY WHOA!

773
00:22:33,449 --> 00:22:34,250
MAYBE YOU KNOW WE GOT THAT

774
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,284
PARKING PROBLEM STORY,

775
00:22:35,284 --> 00:22:36,051
YOU MIGHT JUST WANT TO

776
00:22:36,051 --> 00:22:38,220
YOU KNOW STICK TO THAT.

777
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,121
>>RED: YEAH I THINK WE'LL

778
00:22:39,121 --> 00:22:40,122
BE ALL RIGHT, I MEAN IF WORSE

779
00:22:40,122 --> 00:22:41,157
COMES TO WORSE WE'LL JUST WAIT

780
00:22:41,157 --> 00:22:41,957
FOR THE WINTER BECAUSE

781
00:22:41,957 --> 00:22:43,325
THE VAN WILL BE COLD,

782
00:22:43,325 --> 00:22:44,093
SHE'LL SHRINK A BIT AND THE

783
00:22:44,093 --> 00:22:44,960
ENTRANCE WILL FREEZE UP

784
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,162
AND I THINK SHE'LL JUST POP

785
00:22:46,162 --> 00:22:47,830
RIGHT OUT OF THERE.

786
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,098
>>HAROLD: OKAY BUT, WELL

787
00:22:49,098 --> 00:22:50,132
CONSIDER THIS, MAYBE THE OTHER

789

THEY ARE, THEY'LL GET

790
00:22:52,434 --> 00:22:54,937
STUCK IN THERE.

791
00:22:54,937 --> 00:22:56,372
>>RED: WELL IF THAT HAPPENS

792
00:22:56,372 --> 00:22:57,072
WE'LL GIVE THEM THEIR

793
00:22:57,072 --> 00:22:59,308
