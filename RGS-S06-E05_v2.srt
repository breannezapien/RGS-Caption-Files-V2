1
00:00:01,901 --> 00:00:04,938
It's the New Red Green Show

2
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:07,974
Here is the man who wears
his heart on his sleeve

3
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:09,976
Right next to his ketchup and gravy stains.

4
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:12,979
Your hero, my uncle Red Green.

5
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:24,858
Thank you, appreciate it.

6
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:27,961
Well, today I'm going to do something, I
really enjoy

7
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:29,395
You going fishing knucklehead.

8
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:34,601
No, I'm going to Ross Perot's house for a
fondue party.

9
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:37,103
Of course I'm going fishing.

10
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,973
Going fishing for lake trout, tried to go
last Sunday,

11
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,275
so many fishermen out there had
to jump up and down the boat

12
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,643
just to get her to touch the water.

13
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,246
Well, that's because the church is closed.

14
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:48,314
Reverend Frank just closed up the church and
left town.

15
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:51,584
Why? Because if you ran out of sinners, you
can just come to the lodge.

16
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:53,119
No, no, no, no, no.

17
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,689
He just went looking for a bigger church,
you know, I guess he's paid on commission

18
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:00,026
Anyway, church is closed up and there's no
more Sunday services.

19
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:01,928
Not at all. No church on Sunday.

20
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:03,596
We've got to do something about that here.

21
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:04,898
Can't let that go.

22
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,433
Well, what do you care? You never went to
church anyway.

23
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:08,968
Well, no, no, it's not for me.

24
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:10,003
It's for the other people.

25
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:12,372
They've got to be in church on Sunday with
the fishes of men

26
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,374
so I can be out in the lake with
the fishes, a trout.

27
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,459
What you're looking at now is
a bunch of

28
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:35,461
segments from this particular show.

29
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:40,033
The main message being, for gosh sakes,
don't even think about changing the channel.

30
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:43,403
I'll tell you something you want to make
sense out of this program.

31
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,605
You've got to give it your undivided
attention.

32
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:56,382
Well, I thought we should place an ad for a
new reverend, but the want ads don't seem to

33
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,651
have a classification for religious leaders.

34
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,653
Maybe under business personals,

35
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:04,223
Maybe under sales or delivery services.

36
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,927
Are you dressed like that? Here are the
village people hiring roadies.

37
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,398
No, my Boy Scout troop is meeting
here tonight

38
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:17,336
Boy Scouts coming to Possum Lodge,
was there a badge for that like indoor

39
00:02:17,336 --> 00:02:18,337
survival or something?

40
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,474
No, no, no. Normally we meet at the church,
right?

41
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:25,077
But ever since Reverend Frank took off after
a bigger flock of followers, church is

42
00:02:25,077 --> 00:02:28,347
closed. So, you know, Possum Lodge is here,
the boy scouts there, I figured.

43
00:02:28,347 --> 00:02:29,182
You know...

44
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,886
You can't be ringing Boy Scouts to the lodge
just because the reverend

45
00:02:33,886 --> 00:02:34,987
got the flock out of here, Harold.

46
00:02:38,257 --> 00:02:41,027
I don't think you want to get the Boy Scouts
upset, Uncle Red.

47
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,763
They have sharp little knives
and they know a lot of knots.

48
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:47,433
We got to get a new reverend.

49
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,734
I'm going to get that church back up.

50
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:50,603
You know what? Maybe a school bus will come
into town.

51
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:53,139
One of those ones all painted up with the
flower power and the peace signs and

52
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,941
catch on fire and melt.

53
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:57,643
How would that help?

54
00:02:57,643 --> 00:02:59,078
That's how we got Reverend Frank.

55
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,815
A little bit later in the show,

56
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,617
Bill and Harold are going to pitch a tent.

57
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,952
Go camping, that kind of thing.

58
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:09,789
Two heads are better than one.

59
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,925
Not those heads, I would say.

60
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,095
What they're going to do now
is a little bit of a preview here of

61
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,129
what's going to happen later on.

62
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:19,365
Harold’s got the tent pegs in there.

63
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,368
I was smart enough to stay away from
this adventure and watch Bill.

64
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:24,103
Ok? Wow.

65
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,005
Getting out the big hammer there...

66
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,241
What do you think Harold.
Is this is a good idea?

67
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,910
You're going to hold it. Good idea?

68
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:32,044
What do you think? You're going to hold the
pegs?

69
00:03:32,311 --> 00:03:33,212
Good idea?

70
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:36,248
You're fine. Gosh, come on.

71
00:03:36,248 --> 00:03:38,284
Come on, come on.

72
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:41,787
Part of the ritual, part of the
addition of being a man up at the lodge, you

73
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:43,356
got to hold the tent pegs for Bill.

74
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:44,390
Watch out!

75
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:45,458
Oh, you’re fine.

76
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,325
You're good. You're good.

77
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:47,360
Uh oh.

78
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:48,961
You’re fine, you’re good.

79
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:49,862
More of that later.

80
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,200
All the grass is wet this morning.

81
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,501
It glitters in the sun.

82
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:56,902
It soaks my shoes.

83
00:03:56,902 --> 00:03:59,038
It makes me news, as the wetness, the
moisture comes.

84
00:03:59,071 --> 00:04:02,808
I check all the plumbing and for leaks in
the watering can.

85
00:04:02,808 --> 00:04:06,212
But this H2O seems to flow through
the hole in the roof of my van.

86
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:10,616
Ok, this is for the big one.

87
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:13,652
For some of Buster Hadfield's famous chili
and a new set of seat covers,

88
00:04:13,652 --> 00:04:17,089
Uncle Red, you have 30 seconds to get
Mr. Dalton Humphreys

89
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:19,859
of the Humphreys’s Everything Store to say
this word.

90
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:22,828
Teenager.

91
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:26,398
And go.

92
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,068
All right, Dalton. Less than 20 years old.

93
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:30,035
Good as new.

94
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,373
I'm talking about a person
who's less than 20 years old.

95
00:04:34,373 --> 00:04:36,075
Punk.

96
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:39,712
Younger than 20 older than 12.

97
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:41,981
Shoplifter.

98
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:45,484
This is a general term like like your
daughter.

99
00:04:45,784 --> 00:04:46,619
She's a...

100
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:47,686
Burden.

101
00:04:47,686 --> 00:04:48,954
A terrible, terrible burden.

102
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:53,993
All right, all right, all right. She was an
infant, then she became a toddler,

103
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,895
then an adolescence, and now she's a...

104
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:58,397
Demon Satan's spawn devil worshiping...

105
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:03,836
Yes, yes, I know she acts that way,
but that's because she became this...

106
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:04,336
Fat.

107
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:08,607
We're almost out of time, almost out of time.

108
00:05:08,674 --> 00:05:10,442
All right, Dolton...

109
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:11,744
To you,

110
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,379
this person gets away with murder.

111
00:05:14,546 --> 00:05:16,682
O.J Simpson, O.J. Simpson!

112
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:25,791
This week on Hany man Corner, we're going to do something,
make a lot of you guys feel young and alive

113
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,093
that will make a lot of you guys feel
young and alive again,

114
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,561
because it's dangerous.

115
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,363
Now I don't mean dangerous to build.

116
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,731
All my projects are that way.

117
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:35,134
I'm talking about dangerous to use.

118
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:36,468
That's what gets the juices going.

119
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:39,071
You know, the adrenaline, the testosterone,
the hydrogen peroxide.

120
00:05:39,838 --> 00:05:43,342
Now I'm sure that most of you know what
these units are here, but I'll tell you.

121
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:46,345
With the invention of the space age,
plastic and the know wax floors and

122
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:49,581
everything. These units have become kind of
a thing of the past, so you can get them real

123
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:52,084
cheap, like at a yard sale or even a dump.

124
00:05:52,117 --> 00:05:53,485
You're going to need two of
them.

125
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,255
One for the left foot, one for the right
foot.

126
00:05:57,222 --> 00:06:00,359
What are we going to make? How about
electric roller blades?

127
00:06:01,493 --> 00:06:03,829
You know those young people today and the
dumb things they're doing?

128
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:05,397
Well, I think we're one step ahead on this
time.

129
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:09,635
All right. First thing you got to do is you
got to separate the head of the unit from the

130
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:13,972
handle and you might use one of these
lubricating sprays and just very careful

131
00:06:13,972 --> 00:06:17,776
where you put it. There's sometimes a
little hidden nut or bolt in there, and this

132
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,113
will kind of dissolve the rest of them, just
loosen them up to where they'll just come

133
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:23,248
apart, just that much easier.

134
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:28,720
There we go.

135
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:42,067
Remember a few winters ago when
you said, boy, you know, I need a winter

136
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:46,004
activity. Actually, it's probably your wife
that said it or your doctor.

137
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:49,374
So you went out and you got yourself some
cross-country skiing.

138
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:51,877
They tried it once and it was fine.

139
00:06:51,877 --> 00:06:54,813
Everything. Then you came to your senses and
bought a snowmobile.

140
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,682
Well, here's a good news.

141
00:06:57,182 --> 00:07:00,519
You're actually going to be able to use
those cross-country skis now because what we

142
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:04,389
want to do is we want to take the bindings
off there and the boots off there and then

143
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:05,924
attach them to our four postures.

144
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:12,764
All right now, it's probably a probably a
Scandinavian bolt of some kind, but it could

145
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:15,033
be any kind of threat. All right, that's
fine.

146
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,068
It's fine. It's fine.

147
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:24,176
You don't have to feel bad about how about
doing that to the skis?

148
00:07:24,176 --> 00:07:27,279
Because if you cut up the skiing, you
probably would have done this yourself and

149
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,281
probably done the same thing for your leg.

150
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:33,285
All right now, what you want to do is take
that on to the top of the floor polisher

151
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:37,422
using maybe a bolt in the washer or hey,
whatever you like.

152
00:07:41,827 --> 00:07:44,796
There we go. Now, take a look at how this
works.

153
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,537
See there...

154
00:07:54,873 --> 00:07:58,777
So you know what was on that, that the brush
goes in opposite directions? So that

155
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:02,314
means that once you got them on, you know,
the steering and the direction, it's a little

156
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:05,650
bit sensitive you got to maybe if you want
to go backwards, I I'd say, lean forward,

157
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,320
want to go forward. You lean backwards, you
want to go left, you lean right, you want to

158
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,089
go right, you lean left, hand up, sit down,
fight, fight, fight.

159
00:08:11,323 --> 00:08:15,727
If you want to stop altogether, you would
lean all the way forward into what I believe

160
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:17,162
they call a face plant.

161
00:08:17,863 --> 00:08:19,898
All right, we're all set.

162
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:22,167
Let's go rollerblading.

163
00:08:34,646 --> 00:08:39,351
Now, obviously, you need a
portable source of electricity, so gotten a

164
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:41,253
hold of a bunch of the nine volt batteries.

165
00:08:41,286 --> 00:08:44,055
There is no Walkman working within 50 miles
of the lodge right now.

166
00:08:44,422 --> 00:08:45,924
And when you wire these up, this is very
important.

167
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:49,227
Make sure you have the same amount of
electricity going to each foot.

168
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:52,464
All right now, I'm ready to go rollerblading
electrically.

169
00:08:53,064 --> 00:08:54,766
So remember, the women don't find you
handsome.

170
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:56,701
They should at least find a happy.

171
00:09:09,547 --> 00:09:12,250
All right, there's been a technique involved.

172
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:14,486
Yes, I need a little more Polish.

173
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:24,029
Stay down and relax, whatever this is, we got
lots more of it.

174
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:33,972
I want to talk to you, older
guys about diet and exercise because you're

175
00:09:33,972 --> 00:09:38,443
running like me. You plan to start
exercising first thing tomorrow morning or.

176
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:45,950
Next week or possibly the week after that,
but certainly by the end of the summer, of

177
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,519
course, it's all talk and no action.

178
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,921
And why is that? Because you got no
motivation.

179
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:52,090
I was looking at a thing in the paper here.

180
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:56,261
Some doctor has done a study on guys who've
had heart attacks and get this usually when a

181
00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:58,329
guy has his first heart attack, you know
what he does.

182
00:09:58,363 --> 00:10:01,432
He jumps up and he starts exercise.

183
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:05,203
Well, that's what they do do they get up
there and they get going.

184
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:07,472
There's no talk at all. It's all action and
why?

185
00:10:08,206 --> 00:10:09,908
Of course, he's motivated at that point.

186
00:10:10,675 --> 00:10:14,312
So don't you guys be beating yourself up
because you eat too much of the wrong stuff

187
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:16,114
or you smoke or you drink or whatever?

188
00:10:16,548 --> 00:10:20,752
Once the old ticker gives you the, you know,
or they find a lump or there isn't supposed

189
00:10:20,752 --> 00:10:25,990
to be one or the doctor holds up your X-ray
and goes, “uh-oh”.

190
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:29,494
Then by golly, you'll have all the
motivation you need.

191
00:10:29,494 --> 00:10:32,530
Remember, I'm pulling for you.
We're all in this together.

192
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:41,673
Well, I've already received a couple of
applications for a new reverend here for the

193
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:44,309
Possum Lake area. This one's even got a
picture in it.

194
00:10:45,109 --> 00:10:47,011
Hi, I'm a sun worshipper.

195
00:10:48,212 --> 00:10:50,481
I believe that God wants us all to be naked.

196
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:54,152
Not you. He doesn't sir.

197
00:10:56,321 --> 00:11:01,426
Oh, sorry, ma'am. I was just going to say?
Pope Larry...

198
00:11:18,443 --> 00:11:19,844
The high priest of the Incas

199
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:24,348
It’s me, Harold. We're having a Morris
dance group meeting here Tonight.

200
00:11:24,348 --> 00:11:25,650
Oh, no, you're not Harold.

201
00:11:26,284 --> 00:11:27,518
Yes we are.

202
00:11:27,518 --> 00:11:28,386
Not dressed like that, you’re not.

203
00:11:28,386 --> 00:11:29,854
There laws, OK?

204
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:34,492
Yes, there are. Yes, there are laws and
there's a municipal bylaw, the one that

205
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:35,993
granted you the lease of this land.

206
00:11:35,993 --> 00:11:38,463
It stipulates you have to create space for
the community.

207
00:11:38,696 --> 00:11:39,564
Since when?

208
00:11:39,897 --> 00:11:41,199
It’s in the charter.

209
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,734
Well, nobody's ever come here before.

210
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:48,439
No kidding. Yeah, a choice between the church
and here.

211
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:51,609
Where would you go? Even the Satanists
prefer the church.

212
00:11:53,144 --> 00:11:54,879
Who else has dibs on this place, Harold?

213
00:11:54,912 --> 00:11:57,949
Well, anyone else who ever used a church like
the Floor Hockey League, the bingo?

214
00:11:58,282 --> 00:11:59,417
Yeah, I've got to find a Reverend

215
00:11:59,784 --> 00:12:01,185
Yay Yay Group is going to be here.

216
00:12:01,185 --> 00:12:02,820
The Hymn and Howl Group, it's going to be
here.

217
00:12:03,054 --> 00:12:04,889
All sorts thing. So we're going to have the...

218
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:09,627
The heck is this?

219
00:12:09,627 --> 00:12:10,595
Man, that’s loud.

220
00:12:43,227 --> 00:12:45,930
The Irish dancers are going to be here.

221
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:46,831
Yeah.

222
00:12:46,831 --> 00:12:50,334
There’s going to be the
the Wine and Cheese Club...

223
00:13:00,811 --> 00:13:02,079
Did I mention the Model Airplane Club?

224
00:13:02,246 --> 00:13:03,948
No you didn’t, Harold.

225
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,757
And today we're going to hear
from Mr. Buzz Sherwood.

226
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:18,829
Hey, my name's Buzz.

227
00:13:22,099 --> 00:13:24,835
Well, I went two weeks without acting like a
guy.

228
00:13:25,436 --> 00:13:27,705
All right.

229
00:13:28,172 --> 00:13:32,443
But it gets hard because, you know, it's,
you know, seat up before.

230
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,678
Put the seat down when you're done.

231
00:13:35,946 --> 00:13:39,817
But last Sunday, I had a setback.

232
00:13:39,817 --> 00:13:42,353
Ok? I was in the backyard.

233
00:13:42,353 --> 00:13:46,524
I was putting this new gas barbecue together
and everything was just going great.

234
00:13:46,524 --> 00:13:50,394
But then I couldn't figure out how to attach
the burner to the main unit, right?

235
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:52,463
And I just started acting like a guy.

236
00:13:52,463 --> 00:13:54,498
I said, Well, there must be parts missing.

237
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:59,970
And then I went in and I got more tools, and
then and then I got the duct tape and I said,

238
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:03,641
Oh, just Jerry, rig this and make it work,
and then I'll just throw it in the garbage

239
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:05,075
and I'll just make one with my own bare
hands.

240
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:13,651
And then the woman that loves me, she said
she saved me with three little words...

241
00:14:15,352 --> 00:14:17,054
Read the instructions.

242
00:14:20,624 --> 00:14:24,428
The instructions, man, you know, like these
were like, these are like the extra cards you

243
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:29,133
get in the new deck, right? You throw them
out, or it's like the little piece of paper

244
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:32,403
you get a new pair of jeans, right, that
says inspected by number forty seven.

245
00:14:41,478 --> 00:14:42,479
What was I talking about? 

246
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,381
The instructions.

247
00:14:45,282 --> 00:14:55,125
So I read them right and and I was doing it
wrong, and then I realized this piece of

248
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,662
paper made me realize I was a failure.

249
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,233
And then I thought, No, man, you're not a
failure.

250
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:06,036
No way you, you would have figured it out
eventually, right?

251
00:15:06,136 --> 00:15:08,839
You didn't need to read the stupid
instructions.

252
00:15:09,173 --> 00:15:10,441
You know, you would have you would have got
it.

253
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:14,645
And then I thought, Well, then reading the
instructions, you're not asking for help.

254
00:15:15,646 --> 00:15:16,780
You're cheating.

255
00:15:19,316 --> 00:15:20,617
I'm not a loser man.

256
00:15:20,717 --> 00:15:24,254
I'm a cheater. I felt a lot better.

257
00:15:32,162 --> 00:15:36,567
Meanwhile, back at the tent pegs, we're going
to finish up the adventures with Bill now,

258
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:42,272
and they're still working on that, working
on the windows around the lodge and this is

259
00:15:42,272 --> 00:15:43,373
one of these new kind of tents.

260
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:44,741
They're going to put out Bill and they're
out here.

261
00:15:44,741 --> 00:15:49,580
It's got kind of the progress isn't always a
good thing there anyway.

262
00:15:49,713 --> 00:15:53,517
It's one of the I don't know what they call
them, umbrella tent or something like that.

263
00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:56,720
Where the frames all on the outside, and
it's got a lot of spring to it.

264
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,725
A lot of spring there. Oh boy, oh my night
fell anyway.

265
00:16:01,725 --> 00:16:05,829
And they go, and you know, this is one of
the great things I think about camping.

266
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:09,900
You don't want to get too big a tent because
part of the experience is the is the bonding

267
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:14,037
feeling that you get just by being in a
confined, you know, something you don't need.

268
00:16:14,271 --> 00:16:17,174
What you find is there are certain things
that you take, you really don't need.

269
00:16:17,608 --> 00:16:21,378
But you know, the point being that when you
get into one of them smaller tents there,

270
00:16:21,645 --> 00:16:25,782
just maybe a one man tent and you get two
men in there and you don't need they don't

271
00:16:25,782 --> 00:16:27,951
need as many things as you. Maybe you might
think that you do.

272
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:33,523
You find a good while you find that you get
into kind of a thing where you know, you get

273
00:16:33,523 --> 00:16:34,391
to talk about

274
00:16:34,391 --> 00:16:38,362
Things and just, oh my gosh.
What the heck?

275
00:16:39,162 --> 00:16:40,430
What do you got in there, Boys?

276
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,333
Oh, oh, it's a boy.

277
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:47,704
All right. And then they can just lay back
there and see that that's kind of when they

278
00:16:47,704 --> 00:16:52,609
can talk about things and just just have
that camaraderie that goes hand in hand with

279
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:56,279
camping, camping and now this.

280
00:16:56,646 --> 00:16:57,914
Ok. All right. All right.

281
00:16:58,248 --> 00:16:59,282
Ok, we have. Ok.

282
00:16:59,316 --> 00:17:00,617
All right, Harold. There's a problem there.

283
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:05,956
You have what you have is what we like to
call a snorer. Also known as a

284
00:17:05,956 --> 00:17:09,526
fist magnet. And in this case, Harold is going to
try and take a little more peaceful.

285
00:17:09,526 --> 00:17:11,595
Shine alight his eyes.

286
00:17:12,362 --> 00:17:19,002
One thing about Bill, when he's asleep, he
is asleep, and when he's awake, he's really

287
00:17:19,002 --> 00:17:24,074
too much awake to what he's going to do
now, is realizing one of the things they

288
00:17:24,074 --> 00:17:25,909
thrown out because the snorkel masks that.

289
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:28,245
So he just grabs the mask, putting that
someplace.

290
00:17:28,578 --> 00:17:33,283
Apparently, if the end to interrupt the
breathing... What’s that there? 

291
00:17:33,783 --> 00:17:37,454
Some sort of a massive Rattler or something
there. Any way, if you interrupt the

292
00:17:37,454 --> 00:17:38,722
breathing pattern, apparently you can.

293
00:17:38,755 --> 00:17:40,257
There we go. Yeah, I just like that.

294
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,892
There you go. See you there. There's a
problem.

295
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:44,995
Well, what? All right.

296
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:46,863
Not perfect, not perfect.

297
00:17:47,797 --> 00:17:51,034
Herald realizes that he's got
the snorkel, but the snorkel in the mouth

298
00:17:51,034 --> 00:17:56,773
there, but he doesn't grab the snorkel, you
know, grabs the assistance in this case, a

299
00:17:56,773 --> 00:17:58,141
snake, Harold, that's a snake.

300
00:17:58,174 --> 00:17:59,376
Harold Harold is his name.

301
00:17:59,476 --> 00:18:00,744
Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah.

302
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:05,282
Oh yeah, see. And the lamb lie down with the
lion and the bill.

303
00:18:05,315 --> 00:18:06,483
Shall I download the ruler?

304
00:18:08,051 --> 00:18:10,020
Here's a love letter to Harold from a lady
viewer.

305
00:18:10,654 --> 00:18:11,755
Nice stationery.

306
00:18:15,258 --> 00:18:18,795
And now for that part of the show where we
explore the three little words that men find

307
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:20,463
so difficult to say...

308
00:18:20,463 --> 00:18:22,866
I don’t know.

309
00:18:22,866 --> 00:18:24,234
So true.

310
00:18:24,868 --> 00:18:28,638
Joining me Uncle Red in the expert portion
of the show is a brand new

311
00:18:28,638 --> 00:18:31,041
person in the Possum Lake area, building a
cottage up here.

312
00:18:31,074 --> 00:18:32,609
Ladies and gentlemen, successful businessman,

313
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:33,843
Mr. Kevin Black.

314
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,951
I chose this letter, especially for you,
Mr. Black

315
00:18:41,951 --> 00:18:43,720
Dear experts.

316
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,657
I am a corporate executive in a large
metropolitan area, and I'm thinking about

317
00:18:47,657 --> 00:18:49,826
buying a cottage up around Possum Lake.

318
00:18:49,926 --> 00:18:51,761
How can I go about making a purchase?

319
00:18:52,095 --> 00:18:55,532
Hang on one second, guys. Yeah, I think we
should probably just take that right to bed.

320
00:18:55,565 --> 00:18:56,833
See how it creases the sheets.

321
00:18:57,901 --> 00:18:59,569
All right.

322
00:19:07,644 --> 00:19:13,049
Guys, right up front, what I'd like to say
is that I think a summer property is just a

323
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:14,150
fantastic idea.

324
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,418
I love this area.

325
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:17,620
I figure I'll get used to the people.

326
00:19:18,254 --> 00:19:22,025
As a matter of fact, I recently purchased a
thousand acres of waterfront.

327
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:25,662
Yeah, Kevin, here about blood point.

328
00:19:26,196 --> 00:19:28,698
Actually, it's called Bluff Point on the real
estate survey map.

329
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:31,434
Yeah. Well, the guy who did the map never
lived there.

330
00:19:33,102 --> 00:19:34,304
How are the mosquitoes, Kevin?

331
00:19:35,672 --> 00:19:37,440
Oh, they're fine. Fine, fine.

332
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,443
And I'm I'm told, of course, they're not
always this bad.

333
00:19:40,476 --> 00:19:42,278
No, no. They're a lot worse than the spring.

334
00:19:43,846 --> 00:19:45,415
Don't you listen to him, Mr. Black.

335
00:19:45,415 --> 00:19:48,918
It’s a beautiful spot, you got out
there, nice cottage, you're building and

336
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:50,954
everything. Is that a swimming pool you're
putting in?

337
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,488
Oh no, Harold. No, no, it's not.

338
00:19:52,522 --> 00:19:56,826
No, it's a tennis court and I'm building it
right in a stand of cedar trees.

339
00:19:57,627 --> 00:19:58,661
Oh, that's a great idea.

340
00:19:58,695 --> 00:20:03,733
You know, you might want to do with that,
Kevin, just a suggestion, of course, is but a

341
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:08,705
real fine mesh on the fence on that unit or
maybe a sign saying no mosquitoes.

342
00:20:11,908 --> 00:20:13,009
That wouldn't work, would it?

343
00:20:20,316 --> 00:20:24,687
What I think Mr. Black is saying to this
viewer is by all means, come on up the lake

344
00:20:24,687 --> 00:20:29,592
and buy up the property, there's some
bargain prices here for you.

345
00:20:29,592 --> 00:20:32,362
But let me give you a suggestion don't buy
vacant property, OK?

346
00:20:32,362 --> 00:20:34,464
The community's been here one hundred and
fifty years.

347
00:20:34,464 --> 00:20:38,401
If there's land up here that hasn't been
built on by now, usually a pretty good reason

348
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:44,540
for that. Here's what you want to do find
the oldest building in the area, something

349
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,343
that's been around here since day one
because they had every location to choose

350
00:20:47,343 --> 00:20:50,379
from in those days. That's going to be the
place on the best spot.

351
00:20:50,613 --> 00:20:51,848
But an offer in on that one?

352
00:20:52,315 --> 00:20:55,218
Hey, surprisingly, that's pretty darn good
information.

353
00:20:55,218 --> 00:20:55,751
Uncle Red.

354
00:20:55,952 --> 00:20:58,654
Yes. And you know what? I'd be interested in
pursuing this.

355
00:20:58,654 --> 00:21:00,123
I have a number of investors.

356
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:02,658
We could put together some kind of limited
partnership now.

357
00:21:03,092 --> 00:21:05,128
What did you say was the oldest building
around here?

358
00:21:05,595 --> 00:21:06,429
Well, the lodge.

359
00:21:17,807 --> 00:21:21,477
Well, good news, just got off the phone with
Reverend Frank.

360
00:21:21,911 --> 00:21:26,015
I figured he had a problem because he called
Collect, you know, it turns out he couldn't

361
00:21:26,015 --> 00:21:28,951
get another job, you know, because the
churches are all cutting back with the

362
00:21:28,951 --> 00:21:30,152
financial things and everything.

363
00:21:30,152 --> 00:21:32,989
I guess they figure it’s cheaper
to let everyone go to hell.

364
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:38,094
So Reverend Frank is coming back and the
church is open for business.

365
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:46,469
What happened Harold? Bad reviews? 

366
00:21:46,469 --> 00:21:49,138
No bad reviews. We were dow
in the basement,

367
00:21:49,138 --> 00:21:54,710
and we're rehearsing our Andrew Lloyd
Webber's version of Cats, you know...

368
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,913
Bunch of the lodge members thought it would be
funny to let their dogs down in their.

369
00:22:00,349 --> 00:22:04,520
They went wild. The way dogs do. Wild.

370
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,554
I know what you’re saying.

371
00:22:05,554 --> 00:22:07,189
Yeah, we can't do cats anymore.

372
00:22:07,189 --> 00:22:08,924
We're going to do Les Misérable.

373
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:16,432
Wow. Everything you actors do is pretty misérable,
if you ask me. Oh there’s the meeting.

374
00:22:16,665 --> 00:22:20,069
If you change your clothes and get down
there all the down a minute.

375
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:21,637
Do you want to clean up your
kitty litter here, Harold?

376
00:22:27,143 --> 00:22:30,613
My wife is watching, I'll be coming straight
home after the meeting and in keeping with

377
00:22:30,613 --> 00:22:31,614
this religious theme.

378
00:22:32,114 --> 00:22:36,352
If you're in the mood to guide a lost soul
to a heavenly body, I'm your man.

379
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,256
Thanks for watching on behalf of
Harold and myself,

380
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:42,992
and the whole gang of here, inlcuding
Rum Dum Tigger

381
00:22:42,992 --> 00:22:44,894
Keep your stick on the ice.

382
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,282
Harold, do you start off here?

383
00:23:06,615 --> 00:23:08,517
Yes. I like to ask ther person

384
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:10,686
who stole all the duct tape from my
bedroom to

385
00:23:10,686 --> 00:23:11,720
please raise their hand.

386
00:23:13,589 --> 00:23:16,859
All right, then maybe the person who taped me
to the bed would raise their hand.
