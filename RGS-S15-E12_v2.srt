00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:04,537
You know, as I get older,
I find that my reflexes

2
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:06,005
are really
slowing down

3
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:08,575
and my reaction time to, say,
an approaching brick

4
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:10,477
or a propane fireball

5
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:12,746
is really too slow
to be effective.

6
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:15,315
So what was happening is
I'm getting a lot of
head injuries,

7
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:18,284
and I'm afraid it's going
to start ammenting me
fectally --

8
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:22,288
I mean, affect --
no, that's right,
ammenting me fectally.

9
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:24,190
Ow!

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,692
So here's a
cheap, easy way

11
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,660
to protect what just
recently has become

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,229
the most important
part of your body...

13
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,897
your brain.

14
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:33,466
Get yourself one of these
inflatable kids' life rings.

15
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,168
You can just grab
this off any kid,

16
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:36,336
but don't be a bully,

17
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:39,005
make sure it's a kid
who can swim.

18
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:42,809
This life ring is going
to become my brain bag.

19
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,110
I'm just letting
the air out of it

20
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,211
so I can fill it with,

21
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,981
that's right,
shaving cream.

22
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,382
It's kind of
like an air bag

23
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:52,352
but I'm not an air head,
so I'm using shaving cream.

24
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:53,786
I mean you could
use whipped cream,

25
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:55,588
but I want to
survive close shaves.

26
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:58,558
I don't want to get
whipped or creamed.

27
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,426
See, I still got
my sense of humour.

28
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:02,896
It hasn't ammented
me fectally.

29
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,637
Okay, I've connected the
shaving cream to
the life ring

30
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,839
by going through this
motion detector.

31
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,474
Now, if anything
approaches my head,

32
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:17,777
the detector will fill the
life ring with shaving cream

33
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:20,947
and cushion my melon so
that nothing can bean me.

in a supporting wall

mounted on display

on the top of a hill,
90 feet in the air.

They pretended they
had a happy marriage,

with us last weekend.

I'll spare you the
grisly details,

them to the airport

nine hours before
their flight,

and they didn't mind.

203
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:43,154
But I noticed that when
the planes come in

204
00:08:43,154 --> 00:08:45,290
they have these
flaps that they use

205
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,093
to help slow them down
when they're landing.

with his ears when he's skiing.

They're big flaps that kind
of pop out of the body

00:08:54,499 --> 00:08:56,434
and slow the plane down.

Old Man Sedgwick had
something pop out of his body,

00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,609
can we add big
flaps to a car?

How would we do that?

214
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:15,787
If flaps are good enough
for an F-18 or a F-16,

215
00:09:15,787 --> 00:09:18,156
they're good enough
for a F-O-R-D.

216
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:20,091
But we need more than
just the hood to open

217

so hook up a couple of
clothes line pulleys

hood ornament

Oh, boy.

RED:
Mike had invited Bill
to come out a play squash.

327
00:14:27,898 --> 00:14:29,366
Bill had never
played squash before

328
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:30,768
and was not familiar
with the game,

329
00:14:30,768 --> 00:14:31,802
but he had the sweatsuit on

330
00:14:31,802 --> 00:14:33,504
so Mike got down
to his shorts and...

331
00:14:33,504 --> 00:14:35,572
I'm not sure the Bill
knows how to get down
to his --

332
00:14:35,572 --> 00:14:39,243
that's not what we mean by --
that's unfortunate,

333
00:14:39,243 --> 00:14:40,944
there must have been
a gravity spot there.

334
00:14:40,944 --> 00:14:43,514
Anyway, Mike's got
the outfit on.

335
00:14:43,514 --> 00:14:44,882
Bill, what are
you wearing?

336
00:14:44,882 --> 00:14:46,383
Bill, what is that?
No, that's not.

337
00:14:46,383 --> 00:14:50,788
There's something --
That's just wrong, you know.

338
00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:54,224
So, of course, Mike has
the regular squash racket.

339
00:14:54,224 --> 00:14:57,661
Bill doesn't know what
a regular squash racket is

340
00:14:57,661 --> 00:15:00,464
so he apparently
had brought a banjo.

341
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:02,066
No, that's not...

342
00:15:02,066 --> 00:15:03,834
so he puts that aside
for the moment.

343
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:07,004
He did actually have
a real squash racket.

344
00:15:07,004 --> 00:15:09,339
Now, Mike puts
the goggles on.

345
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:12,142
Bill has -- what have you
got there in your hand?

346
00:15:12,142 --> 00:15:13,510
It's an... owww...

347
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,379
That's an odd
place to carry --

348
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:18,315
No, that's not where
the racket goes, Bill.

349
00:15:18,315 --> 00:15:20,584
Not at all, no.

350
00:15:20,584 --> 00:15:23,053
Now, again, when Bill
heard the word squash,

351
00:15:23,053 --> 00:15:26,256
he thought that you played
with a real squash,

352
00:15:26,256 --> 00:15:27,658
which he had
brought with him.

353
00:15:27,658 --> 00:15:29,193
No Bill, no, that's not --

354
00:15:29,193 --> 00:15:30,461
You play with a little,
round...

355
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:32,463
There, it's a little,
round squash ball.

356
00:15:32,463 --> 00:15:35,032
Okay, so now they got to
decide who's going to serve.

357
00:15:35,032 --> 00:15:36,466
Apparently what they do
is they've got the label

358
00:15:36,466 --> 00:15:38,302
on one side and nothing
on the other

359
00:15:38,302 --> 00:15:39,670
so you spin it and
somebody picks it.

360
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,038
Mike picked
the label side.

361
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:46,877
So Bill spins the racket
and away it fli --

362
00:15:48,545 --> 00:15:49,980
and uhh...

363
00:15:50,948 --> 00:15:52,749
and Mike just kicks
it over, finally.

364
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:54,017
Okay, so it's the other side

365
00:15:54,017 --> 00:15:56,620
so I guess that means
Bill's going to serve.

366
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,989
So Bill gets up,
goes up there, comes back,

367
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:01,358
Mike volleys, no ball.

368
00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:03,126
Where's the ball?
Where's the ball?

369
00:16:03,126 --> 00:16:04,962
It's in his racket.

370
00:16:04,962 --> 00:16:06,730
Okay.

371
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,565
All right.
Easy, easy easy.

372
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:10,167
Okay, now it's
Mike's serve.

373
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:12,002
He fires it up, high,

374
00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:15,138
comes down bounces below
going up into his shorts.

375
00:16:15,138 --> 00:16:17,674
No, I hope that's
not an injury.

376
00:16:17,674 --> 00:16:19,710
No, he's okay.

377
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,746
Mike's going to hit it.
Bill says no.

378
00:16:22,746 --> 00:16:24,681
Okay, the mark is still --
I'm not going to ask.

379
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:27,050
It's none of my business.
No, no, no, no.

380
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,385
Moving right along.

381
00:16:28,385 --> 00:16:30,020
Okay, so where
they go again.

382
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,955
Nice couple of
volleys here.

383
00:16:31,955 --> 00:16:33,623
Up and she goes and then
Mike volleys her back and --

384
00:16:33,623 --> 00:16:39,529
On this one, got a little
too close to the wall.

385
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:41,631
Okay, now what.

386
00:16:41,631 --> 00:16:42,899
Oh, I know, the banjo.

387
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,035
So he gets the banjo out.

388
00:16:45,035 --> 00:16:46,937
He serves her up there
and then --

389
00:16:46,937 --> 00:16:49,039
When Mike swings,
he hits the light switch.

390
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,741
Okay, so now they're
playing squash --

391
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:52,676
Okay, now this is --

392
00:16:52,676 --> 00:16:55,712
Now, you know, you know.
Okay, okay, this is wrong.

393
00:16:55,712 --> 00:16:58,115
This is -- ohh....

394
00:16:58,115 --> 00:17:00,217
So Bill comes over,
flips the light on.

395
00:17:00,217 --> 00:17:03,653
Oh boy...

396
00:17:03,653 --> 00:17:06,490
And that see through outfit
is not working for him at all.

397
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:15,866
There's the ball and that's
how squash got it's name.

398
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:18,034
Remember when you got your
VCR so you could tape

399
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:21,371
all those shows you
didn't have time to watch

400
00:17:21,371 --> 00:17:23,473
only to realize that you
didn't have time to watch

401
00:17:23,473 --> 00:17:25,375
the tapes either?

402
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,310
Of course now you've
got a DVD.

403
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,846
So what do you do
with all your old tapes?

404
00:17:29,846 --> 00:17:32,682
Well, you could mail
them to a friend.

405
00:17:32,682 --> 00:17:36,253
Just drop them into a bag
and then seal them up with

406
00:17:36,253 --> 00:17:39,289
your new string dispenser.

407
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:42,158
Or how about this one,
a cassette clock?

408
00:17:42,158 --> 00:17:44,728
Just mount a clock motor
on to one of the reels

409
00:17:44,728 --> 00:17:47,898
and then mark off the
seconds, minutes and hours

410
00:17:47,898 --> 00:17:49,933
onto the tape
with a white pen.

411
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:52,535
The clock motor runs so slow
that a 180-minute tape

412
00:17:52,535 --> 00:17:55,138
takes exactly 12 hours
to get to the end,

413
00:17:55,138 --> 00:17:56,907
so then you just take
the motor off one

414
00:17:56,907 --> 00:17:58,341
and move it over to
the other reel

415
00:17:58,341 --> 00:17:59,709
and wind the
whole thing back.

416
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:01,845
I mean the numbers are
going by outside-down

417
00:18:01,845 --> 00:18:03,680
but I'm sure you
get used to it.

418
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,148
Here's another one,

419
00:18:05,148 --> 00:18:06,650
here's a hint for you.

420
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,885
You know, every cassette has
a ratchet inside

421
00:18:08,885 --> 00:18:11,688
that stops the tape from
slipping back the other way.

422
00:18:11,688 --> 00:18:13,556
Well, there's a button
way down deep inside.

423
00:18:13,556 --> 00:18:16,393
If you can push that with
something like a golf tee,

424
00:18:16,393 --> 00:18:18,495
it lets the tape
come out freely.

425
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,030
Have you figured
it out yet?

426
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,565
That's right...

427
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:34,144
Okay, now for reeling
her back in,

428
00:18:34,144 --> 00:18:36,346
use the window winder
from the driver's side

429
00:18:36,346 --> 00:18:38,715
of a '62 Chev Belair.

430
00:18:38,715 --> 00:18:40,550
If you can't get a Belair
you could substitute

431
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,285
a Pontiac Strato Chief.

432
00:18:42,285 --> 00:18:44,120
Newer models
might work too,

433
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,456
if I owned one,
I'd know for sure.

434
00:18:46,456 --> 00:18:48,491
Oh, I got one!

435
00:18:48,491 --> 00:18:51,061
Now, if you're left-handed
you could just flip
the rod over

436
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:52,796
but you'd have to
reel the other way

437
00:18:52,796 --> 00:18:56,499
so you'd need the window
winder from the passenger side.

Oh man, I've caught

[ POSSUM SQUEALING ]

470
00:20:31,361 --> 00:20:32,695
Meeting time.

471
00:20:32,695 --> 00:20:34,397
Yeah, you know, you
should get a head start.

472
00:20:34,397 --> 00:20:37,967
You may need
extra butter.

473
00:20:37,967 --> 00:20:39,602
Wow.

474
00:20:39,602 --> 00:20:41,771
Okay, if my wife
is watching,

475
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:43,973
I'll be coming straight
home after the meeting.

476
00:20:43,973 --> 00:20:46,075
I tried making the world's
biggest crayons,

477
00:20:46,075 --> 00:20:49,979
and I came this close to
being the world's
biggest dufus.

478
00:20:49,979 --> 00:20:52,482
Thank goodness
for Harold.

479
00:20:52,482 --> 00:20:53,783
And to the rest of you,
thanks for watching.

480
00:20:53,783 --> 00:20:55,118
On behalf of myself
and Harold

481
00:20:55,118 --> 00:20:57,086
and the whole gang up here
at Possum Lodge...

482
00:20:57,086 --> 00:20:58,955
keep your stick on the ice.

483
00:20:58,955 --> 00:21:05,628
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

484
00:21:05,628 --> 00:21:07,597
Sit down. Sit down.

485
00:21:07,597 --> 00:21:09,265
Sit down back there.

486
00:21:09,265 --> 00:21:10,666
Meeting's coming
to order, guys.

487
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:11,200
Everybody's got to sit down.

488
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,235
Sit down.

489
00:21:12,235 --> 00:21:14,871
All rise.

490
00:21:15,838 --> 00:21:19,141
Quando omni flunkus moritati.

491
00:21:19,141 --> 00:21:20,910
RED: Sit down.

492
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,279
Bow your heads
for the man's prayer.

493
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:24,580
I'm a man,

494
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,915
but I can change

495
00:21:25,915 --> 00:21:29,752
if I have to...
I guess.

496
00:21:29,752 --> 00:21:31,420
Okay men,
the bad news is

497
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,556
that until all the explosions
have stopped,

498
00:21:33,556 --> 00:21:36,359
we're going to have to stay
down here in the basement.

499
00:21:43,266 --> 00:21:47,069
The good news is,
it's movie night.
