1
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:05,005
YOU KNOW A MAN 
CAN GET PRETTY HOT 
WALKING AROUND ON A SUMMER'S DAY

2
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:07,607
ESPECIALLY IF THAT MAN HAS
GOT A COUPLE OF EXTRA
POUNDS ON HIM

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,542
AND WEARS A LOT OF FLANNEL.

4
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:12,912
HERE'S A WAY TO KEEP COOL
WITHOUT HAVING TO WEAR
SISSY CLOTHES.

5
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:15,015
GET YOURSELF A
WORM PICKER'S PAIL,

6
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:16,916
ATTACH IT TO ONE FOOT.

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,086
THEN WHAT YOU NEED IS A GAS
SIPHON HOSE LIKE THIS ONE.

8
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,322
YOU RUN THE HOSE DOWN
INSIDE THE PAIL,

9
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,924
UP ONE PANT LEG,
ACROSS AND DOWN THE OTHER ONE.

10
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:28,061
THEN YOU ATTACH THE PUMP OF
THE SIPHON UNDER YOUR
FOOT LIKE THAT

11
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:30,563
SO EVERY TIME YOU TAKE A STEP,
YOU'RE SQUEEZING IT.

12
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:33,400
[crunching sound]

13
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:38,338
NOW ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS FILL
UP THE WORM PAIL WITH ICE WATER,

14
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:44,144
AND THE MORE YOU WALK,
THE COOLER YOU FEEL.

15
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:53,887
[sound of water squirting]

16
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,289
[in high-pitched voice]
BOY, THAT WATER'S COLD.

17
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,291
[applause]

18
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:13,907
[cheering and applause]

19
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:16,142
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
APPRECIATE IT

20
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,144
BOY, EVERYBODY'S PRETTY EXCITED
UP AT THE LODGE.

21
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:20,914
WE'RE HAVING HAVE A LUNAR
ECLIPSE IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

22
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:24,150
AROUND HERE THAT ONLY HAPPENS
EVERY 35 YEARS.

23
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,386
A LITTLE MORE OFTEN IF THERE'S
A TIRE FIRE.

24
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,355
I WANT ALL THE GUYS TO GET
TOGETHER

25
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,458
AND GO UP TO ROCK REEF POINT
AND WATCH IT FROM THERE

26
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:34,327
JUST LIKE WE DID
35 YEARS AGO.

27
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,796
WELL, THAT'S A FIRM GO, RED.
WE'RE ALL SET.

28
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,565
OH, YEAH, DID YOU
CLEAR THAT WITH
ANNE MARIE?

29
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:41,534
OH-HO, I DON'T HAVE TO
CLEAR IT WITH ANNE MARIE.

30
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,137
IF I SAY I'M GOING,
I'M GOING!

31
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,007
ANNE MARIE'S AT
HER MOTHER'S THIS WEEK.

32
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,444
WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU GOTTA
BE THERE, I'LL TELL YA.

33
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,646
IT ONLY HAPPENS
EVERY 35 YEARS.

34
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:54,914
JUNIOR'S GOING,
BUSTER'S GOING,

35
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:56,116
MOOSE IS GOING.

36
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:57,617
OLD MAN SEDGWICK SAYS NO.

37
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:00,520
HE'S ALREADY BEEN
TO THE LAST THREE.

38
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,322
IS STINKY PETERSON GOING?

39
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:03,823
WELL, PROBABLY.

40
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,026
YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO
KEEP THE STINK MAN
AWAY FROM A PARTY.

41
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:08,628
YEAH, IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.
IT'LL BE FUN.

42
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,029
AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING ELSE?

43
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,598
THE ECLIPSE DOESN'T
HAPPEN UNTIL MIDNIGHT.

44
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,700
SO I'M THINKING, WHY DON'T WE
JUST CAMP OVERNIGHT,

45
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,535
JUST LIKE WE DID
35 YEARS BACK?

46
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:17,237
OH, GEEZ, THAT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO.

47
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,805
WE WERE ALL BACK IN
HIGH SCHOOL THEN.

48
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:23,576
YEAH, I WAS IN FRENCH
IMMERSION REFORM SCHOOL.

49
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,678
WOW! DID YOU LEARN
ANY FRENCH THERE?

50
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,347
OH, YEAH.

51
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:32,218
UH, Bonjour. Qu'est-ce que
c'est le combination?

52
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:37,257
THAT MEANS, UH, GOOD DAY.
WHO CAN OPEN THE SAFE?

53
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,426
BOY, I REMEMBER THE BUNCH
OF US THERE THAT NIGHT.

54
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,762
PRETTY WET BEHIND
THE EARS, HUH?

55
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,432
ONCE THE RAIN STARTED,
WE WERE PRETTY WET
BEHIND EVERYTHING.

56
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,701
BOY, THAT WAS
A WHILE BACK, EH?

57
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:52,005
YEAH, BOY, WE SURE DIDN'T KNOW
MUCH ABOUT LIFE THEN, HUH.

58
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:53,773
CERTAINLY DIDN'T
UNDERSTAND WOMEN.

59
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,842
[laughing]

60
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,511
WELL, THEN IT
COULDN'T HAVE
BEEN THAT LONG AGO.

61
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:04,484
[applause]

62
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,788
IT'S TIME FOR THE
POSSUM LODGE WORD GAME!

63
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:15,361
[cheering and applause]

64
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,164
TODAY'S WINNER WILL GET
TO SPEND A WHOLE DAY

65
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:21,234
AS THE TOWN MASCOT.

66
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,337
OKAY, COVER YOUR EARS, ED.

67
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,841
Mr GREEN, YOU'VE GOT 30 SECONDS
TO GET ED TO SAY THIS WORD...

68
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,476
NERVOUS

69
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,844
NERVOUS

70
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,213
YEAH, ALL RIGHT, MIKE.

71
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,048
AND GO!

72
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,350
OKAY, ED, HOW ARE
YOU FEELING?

73
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,686
FAIRLY RELAXED,
RED, THANKS.

74
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,021
OKAY, OKAY, BUT WHEN YOU'RE
NOT RELAXED YOU'RE...

75
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,624
EASY PREY?

76
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:48,228
NO, NO, OKAY, YOU KNOW
WHEN MOST PEOPLE GET ON
TELEVISION LIKE THIS

77
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:52,665
IN FRONT OF A HUGE AUDIENCE,
YOU KNOW, THEY FEEL VERY...

78
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,868
ED?
ED?

79
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,437
ED!

80
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,772
ALL RIGHT,
JUST CALM DOWN.

81
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,575
UM, WHAT DO YOU CALL IT
WHEN YOU GET A DRY MOUTH

82
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,310
AND YOU BREAK OUT IN
A COLD SWEAT?

83
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,013
A WORK DAY.

84
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:09,082
UH, WE'RE ALMOST
OUT OF TIME, Mr GREEN.

85
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,750
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

86
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:13,486
ED, SUPPOSING YOU'RE
UP A LADDER TRYING TO GET
A RACCOON OFF SOMEBODY'S ROOF

87
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,989
AND IT TURNS AND
SNARLS AT YOU, OKAY.

88
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,323
NOW, THAT MAKES YOU...

89
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,726
WET MY PANTS.

90
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,394
OKAY, OKAY.

91
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,663
BUT WHAT DOES IT DO TO
THE GUY HOLDING THE LADDER?

92
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,032
OH, MAKES HIM
PRETTY NERVOUS, I TELL YOU.

93
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:32,205
[cheering and applause]

94
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,080
YOU KNOW, LIFE GOES
INTO CYCLES

95
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:43,549
ONE THING ENDS,
ANOTHER BEGINS.

96
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,185
I'M GOING THROUGH
ONE OF THOSE RIGHT NOW.

97
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:50,490
THIS HERE'S MY NEW POSSUM VAN.
I'M EXCITED ABOUT THAT.

98
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,759
BUT IT ALSO MEANS THE END
OF MY OLD POSSUM VAN,

99
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,460
WHICH MAKES ME KINDA SAD.

100
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,195
BUT YOU KNOW WITH
EVERY OLDER VEHICLE

101
00:04:56,195 --> 00:05:00,233
THERE COMES A TIME
WHEN YOU KNOW IT'S OVER.

102
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,269
I WON'T BORE YOU
WITH THE DETAILS.

103
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:06,773
LET'S JUST SAY THIS TIME
SHE'S NOT PLAYING POSSUM.

104
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:10,343
YOU KNOW, AFTER EVERYTHING
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH TOGETHER,

105
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:13,479
I CAN'T JUST THROW HER
OUT LIKE ONE OF DONALD
TRUMP'S GIRLFRIENDS.

106
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,449
SO AS A LAST GESTURE OF
FRIENDSHIP AND SERVICE,

107
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:20,086
I'M GONNA TURN MY OLD POSSUM
VAN INTO AN AIR BOAT.

108
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:21,688
LIKE THE ONES THEY
HAVE IN FLORIDA

109
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,389
THAT KIND OF WHIP
THROUGH THE EVERGLADES.

110
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:26,392
THEY DON'T ACTUALLY GO IN
THE WATER; THEY KIND OF
GLOSS OVER IT.

111
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:29,629
AND GLOSSING OVER THINGS HAS
ALWAYS BEEN MY PREFERRED
LIFESTYLE.

112
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:33,232
NOW, ORDINARILY, HAVING YOUR
VEHICLE FLIPPED UPSIDE DOWN
WOULD BE A SETBACK,

113
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,400
BUT NOT IN THIS CASE.

114
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,537
ALL YOU DO IS TRACE THE SHAPE
OF AN AIR BOAT ON THE
OUTSIDE OF YOUR VAN

115
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,473
AND THEN CUT AWAY
THE PART YOU DON'T NEED.

116
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,644
NO, WAIT.
WAIT A MINUTE.

117
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,814
ON AN AIR BOAT,
THE MOTOR'S AT THE BACK.

118
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,887
[sawing sound]

119
00:05:55,021 --> 00:06:07,266
[sawing continues]

120
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,004
OKAY,  I HAD A BIT
OF A SNAG THERE.

121
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:13,506
HAD TO TURN THE
ENGINE UPSIDE DOWN

122
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:14,340
SO THAT IT WAS RIGHT-SIDE UP

123
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,876
BECAUSE WHEN IT WAS RIGHT-SIDE
UP, IT WAS UPSIDE DOWN.

124
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,511
'COURSE, I HAD TO FIND A
WAY TO GET THE ENGINE

125
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,346
TO FIT ONTO THE MOTOR MOUNTS
FROM THE OTHER SIDE,

126
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:23,750
BUT LUCKILY, I HAVE A
UNIVERSAL ADAPTER FOR THAT.

127
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,885
THEN WE GET RID OF
THE RAD ALTOGETHER.

128
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:30,423
I'LL JUST EXTEND THESE HOSES.
WE CAN SUCK WATER RIGHT
OUTTA THE LAKE.

129
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,161
OKAY, NOW, THE REASON I HAD TO
GET THE RAD OUTTA THERE,

130
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,096
I WANNA MAKE ROOM
FOR A BIGGER FAN BLADE.

131
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:39,065
AND I KNOW JUST THE THING.

132
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:42,869
AH, I COULD'VE SWORN I SAW --

133
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,670
OH, YEAH!
YEP, YEP, YEP.

134
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,938
HERE IT IS.

135
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,277
NOW, FOR A FINAL TOUCH
ON HER THERE,

136
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,846
I RECYCLED MY
VAN DOORS AS RUDDERS.

137
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,082
GOT 'EM HOOKED UP TO THE
STEERING WHEEL.

138
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:02,488
I KNOW ON THE REAL AIR BOATS
THEY HAVE A CAGE AROUND
THE FAN BLADES,

139
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,457
BUT I FIGURE AS LONG AS YOU
NEVER GO BACK THERE,

140
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,459
YOU SHOULD BE FINE.

141
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,629
[fan blades whirring]

142
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,831
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

143
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,333
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

144
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,369
[fan blades whirring
sound of engine]

145
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:26,779
[cheering and applause]

146
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:36,322
REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG
AND YOU USED TO SEE OLD
MEN OUT ON THE STREET

147
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:39,192
JUST STANDING THERE
STARING AT STUFF?

148
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,728
AND NOW YOU FIND
YOURSELF DOING IT.

149
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,331
HEY, DON'T WORRY.

150
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,767
STARING AT STUFF IS
A NATURAL THING

151
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,902
THAT HAPPENS TO
MIDDLE-AGED GUYS.

152
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,105
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT STUFF
THAT EVERYONE ELSE LOOKS AT,

153
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:56,275
LIKE CYCLONES, HOUSE FIRES
AND TOPLESS WOMEN.

154
00:07:57,109 --> 00:08:01,214
I'M TALKING ABOUT THOSE HOLES
THEY CUT IN BOARD FENCES

155
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,318
AROUND THE CONSTRUCTION SITES
SO YOU CAN LOOK IN THERE.

156
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,854
THE ONLY GUYS THAT ARE LOOKING
IN THERE ARE MIDDLE-AGED GUYS.

157
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,523
FOR SOME REASON WOMEN HAVE NO
TIME TO STICK THEIR HEAD

158
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:14,727
THROUGH A SHEET OF PLYWOOD
TO WATCH BULLDOZERS PUSH
DIRT INTO A PIT.

159
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,865
BUT I TELL YA, I'M THERE
EVERY CHANCE I GET.

160
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,500
AND WHEN I LOOK OVER
AT THE OTHER HOLES,

161
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,603
I SEE OTHER GUYS
JUST LIKE ME.

162
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,939
WITH THE SAME BLANK LOOK
AND THE SAME OPEN SCHEDULE.

163
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,543
YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL BAD;
YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL
EMBARRASSED.

164
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:35,515
AT OUR AGE WE ALREADY KNOW
WE'VE HEARD OURSELVES ENOUGH.

165
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,017
NOW IT'S TIME TO WATCH OTHERS.

166
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,053
SO DON'T FEEL BAD IF YOU
SUDDENLY REALISE

167
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,756
YOU'VE BEEN STANDING THERE
WATCHING GUYS FROM THE CITY

168
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:47,994
FIRE TREE BRANCHES THROUGH
A WOOD CHIPPER FOR AN
HOUR AND A HALF.

169
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,496
JUST SMILE,
COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS,

170
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,031
AND COUNT YOUR FINGERS.

171
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,433
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

172
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:55,635
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

173
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:58,738
[applause]

174
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:03,075
WELL, WE'RE PRETTY MUCH READY
FOR OUR ALL-NIGHTER UP AT
ROCK REEF POINT

175
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,911
TO WATCH THE LUNAR ECLIPSE.

176
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,512
WE'VE HAD PRETTY GOOD RESPONSE;

177
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,448
ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE GUYS
ARE AFRAID IT'S GONNA
MAKE THEM GO BLIND,

178
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:11,817
BUT THEY AGREED TO WATCH UNTIL
THEY NEED GLASSES.

179
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:26,132
[laughter and applause]

180
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,800
WHERE DO YOU WANT
ALL THIS STUFF?

181
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:29,635
WHAT IS IT?

182
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,504
WELL, IT'S ALL THE STUFF
WE NEED FOR THE
LUNAR ECLIPSE.

183
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,706
IT'S GOT FOOD, BEVERAGES,
BLANKETS, PILLOWS

184
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,308
AND A CHANGE OF UNDERWEAR.

185
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,211
IT'S NOT THAT SCARY, DALTON.

186
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:42,682
THE ECLIPSE LASTS
ABOUT A MINUTE AND A HALF.

187
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,251
SOUNDS LIKE MY LOVE LIFE.

188
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,154
INCLUDING THE
35-YEAR WAIT.

189
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:52,158
JUST PUT THAT DOWN
WHEREVER YOU WANT.

190
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,895
YEAH, OKAY,
THAT'S GOOD.

191
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,130
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
WE CAN PUT IT IN THE
VAN WHEN THE TIME COMES.

192
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:03,135
YEAH, I GOT A LITTLE SURPRISE
FOR EVERYBODY LATER ON.

193
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,937
OH, YEAH, DOES IT
INVOLVE THE POLICE?

194
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,275
WHY?
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD?

195
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:10,810
NOTHING.

196
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,945
THEN, NO.

197
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,814
ALL RIGHT.
FINE.

198
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,884
WELL, YOU KNOW,
WINSTON SAID HE'S GOING
TO BRING THE VIDEO CAMERA.

199
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,354
CAPTURE THE LUNAR
ECLIPSE FOR POSTERITY.

200
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,523
OKAY, THAT'LL BE GREAT.
THAT'LL BE GOOD.

201
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:25,891
LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT.

202
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:30,429
YOU KNOW, THE ECLIPSE
IS ABOUT 10 AFTER 12.

203
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:31,897
WHEN DID YOU GUYS
WANNA GO UP THERE?

204
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,666
OH, I'D SAY
ABOUT 11 O'CLOCK.

205
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,768
WELL, WHAT ABOUT 10 O'CLOCK?
THERE MIGHT BE HEAVY TRAFFIC.

206
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:39,805
YEP, DON'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT
IN ROCK CREEK REEF RUSH HOUR,
I'LL TELL YOU.

207
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,479
WELL, WHAT TIME
SHOULD WE GO, HUH?

208
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,015
WELL, 8:30, 9:00,
I GUESS.

209
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:54,286
YEAH, ALL RIGHT!
WELL, LET'S GO NOW!

210
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,655
HEY!

211
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:08,034
[grunting]

212
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:11,904
[cheering and applause]

213
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,707
WELCOME TO THAT PORTION OF THE
SHOW WHERE WE FEATURE

214
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,144
THE THREE LITTLE WORDS
MEN FIND SO HARD TO SAY...

215
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:21,013
Audience: I DON'T KNOW!

216
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,283
AND THIS WEEK'S LETTER
GOES AS FOLLOWS...

217
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,885
"DEAR EXPERTS,

218
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,521
"I'M HOPING YOU CAN
HELP ME WITH MY SIN."

219
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:32,558
OH, SORRY, THAT SAYS
"HELP ME WITH MY SON."

220
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,962
MIGHT BE THE
SAME THING.

221
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,732
"HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING
AROUND THE HOUSE.

222
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:42,868
"HE'S FAILING AT SCHOOL,
AND HE HAS THE MANNERS
OF A FIG."

223
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,938
THAT'S PROBABLY "MANNERS
OF A PIG," DALTON.

224
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,140
NO, IT SAYS FIG.

225
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,842
ALL RIGHT.
YEP.

226
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,944
"HE HAS NO SENSE OF
RESPONSIBILITY

227
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:52,912
"AND NO WORK ETHIC.

228
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,715
"MY WIFE SAYS IT'S JUST A PHASE
HE'S GOING THROUGH,

229
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:58,651
"BUT I'M LOSING HOPE
NOW THAT HE'S 37.

230
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,089
"ANY SUGGESTIONS?"

231
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,759
BOY, IT SOUNDS LIKE THE
TYPE OF GUY MY DAUGHTER
GOES OUT WITH.

232
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,160
WELL, IF HE'S GOT
THE MANNERS OF A FIG,

233
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,029
THAT COULD TURN INTO A
PRETTY HEAVY DATE.

234
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:13,566
[laughing]

235
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,068
THIS IS NOTHING
TO JOKE ABOUT.

236
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,539
HERE WE'VE GOT A GUY
WHO'S 37 YEARS OLD

237
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,775
AND HE'S NEVER WORKED
A DAY IN HIS LIFE.

238
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,944
YOU GOTTA RESPECT THAT.

239
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,216
HEY, HEY, HEY.
THIS GUY IS A DUD.

240
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:35,554
THINK OF THE WILLPOWER
TO RESIST THE PRESSURE
SOCIETY PUTS ON YOU

241
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,923
TO CONFORM AND GET A JOB.

242
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:41,193
YOU KNOW HOW STRONG YOU
HAVE TO BE TO SIT AT
THAT DINNER TABLE

243
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,829
WITH YOUR PARENTS
FOR 37 YEARS

244
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,199
WITHOUT BUCKLING?

245
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,835
THAT'S NOT HOW
I SPELL DUD, RED.

246
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:51,704
LET'S NOT BE
TOO HARSH NOW.

247
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,806
MAYBE THE GUY'S
JUST A LATE BLOOMER.

248
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,207
NO, NO, NO.
HE'S NOT BLOOMING.

249
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,742
HE'S PLANTED TOO DEEP.

250
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:01,013
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
AGREE WITH RED ON THIS ONE, YOU KNOW

251
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,481
I THINK HE
SHOULD GET A JOB

252
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:04,450
AND BE AS MISERABLE
AS THE REST OF US.

253
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:10,723
[applause]

254
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,926
AND MAKE HIS PARENTS
WATCH HIM SUFFER?

255
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,761
HOW DO YOU DO
THAT TO 'EM?

256
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,563
I'D GET OVER IT.

257
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,232
LOOK, WE'VE GOT TO FIND SOME
KIND OF AGREEMENT HERE.

258
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,101
WE CAN'T LEAVE
THIS VIEWER HANGING.

259
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:23,969
WELL, ALL RIGHT, UH,

260
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,272
DWIGHT, WHAT'LL IT TAKE
FOR YOU TO AGREE WITH ME?

261
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,773
FIVE BUCKS.

262
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,076
OKAY, DONE.
THERE YOU GO, DALTON.

263
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,678
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

264
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,079
NOW GIVE HIM
THE FIVE BUCKS.

265
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:34,947
WHAT?
[Red chuckling]

266
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,983
[applause]

267
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,219
Red: THAT'S THE
POSSUM LAKE DRIVE-IN,

268
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,289
BUT, UM, DALTON HAD AN IDEA
TO USE IT DURING THE DAY.

269
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:46,892
YOU COULD SWITCH IT OVER
TO A GOLF DRIVING RANGE.

270
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,961
KIND OF THE SAME
KIND OF SETUP THERE.

271
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,197
THE ELEVATED TEE --
JUST ONE.
JUST ONE.

272
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:52,298
IT'S FIVE BUCKS,
AND YOU GET --

273
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,699
APPARENTLY YOU GET A
FULL BUCKET OF BALLS

274
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:54,867
AND A CLUB
FOR THE FIVE BUCKS.

275
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,903
JUST HAND IT OVER --
HEY! HEY! HEY!

276
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:03,142
OKAY, WELL, MIKE'S BEHIND ME 
WE'RE GONNA HIT A FEW BALLS.

277
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,477
MIKE JUST HAS
THE ONE AS WELL.

278
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:08,814
BECAUSE HE HAS THE LOWER
VEHICLE HE HAS PROBLEMS
GETTING THAT.

279
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,383
NOW YOU GO OUT TO WHERE
YOU MEET TO WATCH THE MOVIE,

280
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,720
AND OF COURSE, YOU HAVE THE
STAND FOR THE SPEAKER THERE.

281
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,489
WELL, YOU HANG YOUR BUCKET OF
BALLS RIGHT ON THERE.

282
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:22,127
BUT DALTON, WELL, DALTON
KNOWS MIKE A LITTLE TOO WELL.

283
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,431
HE'S THINKING MAYBE
ONE DIDN'T COMPLETELY COVER

284
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:30,870
THE ENTIRE TURNOUT THAT MIKE
HAD PRESENTED TO DALTON
EARLIER AT THE BOOTH.

285
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:34,773
IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE
EMBARRASSING MOMENTS IN LIFE

286
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,610
WHEN YOU --

287
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:40,179
QUITE A GANG IN
THERE, ACTUALLY.

288
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,947
NOW, YOU SEE YOU GOT 200 --

289
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,449
THIS IS ALL MARKED
ON THE SCREEN.

290
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,150
AND THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM
IS ARMS LIQUOR GIRL,

291
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,453
IF YOU CAN'T HIT IT
ANY FARTHER THAN THAT.

292
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,722
WHERE YOU HIT IT ON
THE SCREEN IS HOW FAR IT IS.

293
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,324
OF COURSE, DALTON'S GOT TO GIV
US A MILLION INSTRUCTIONS.

294
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,792
WE UNDERSTAND, DALTON.

295
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,928
YOU HIT THE BALL --
WE KNOW.

296
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:58,664
DALTON, LIFE IS TOO SHORT.

297
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,532
BOYS, TEE 'EM UP.
TEE 'EM UP.

298
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,936
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE READY
TO HIT NOW, DALTON.

299
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:07,673
EXCUSE US.
EXCUSE US.
EXCUSE US.

300
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,109
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

301
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:12,244
YOU GO BACK TO THE BOOTH.
THERE YOU GO.

302
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,812
THERE YOU GO.

303
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,581
OKAY, NOW WE CAN GET
DOWN TO SOME SERIOUS --

304
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:16,882
HOLD IT, GUYS,
SOME KIDS!

305
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,417
HANG ON.
HANG ON.

306
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,252
KIDS USING THE PLAYGROUND.

307
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,454
OH, DALTON, WE SEE --
WE SEE THEM!

308
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:23,856
DALTON.

309
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,725
BOYS, TEE 'EM UP.
TEE 'EM UP.

310
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,460
AWAY YOU GO.
AWAY YOU GO.

311
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,095
ALL RIGHT.

312
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,597
AWAY YOU GO.

313
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,799
ALL RIGHT, THERE GO THE KIDS.
WE CAN GET BACK TO GOLFIN'.

314
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,501
ENJOY OURSELVES.

315
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,103
NOW, DALTON'S A LITTLE --
OH, YEAH, THAT'S IT.

316
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,972
WE GOTTA LEAVE.
IT'S OUR FAULT.

317
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,341
EVERYTHING'S OUR FAULT.

318
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:43,609
AH, GEEZ.

319
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,544
ALL RIGHT, BOYS,
DO WHATEVER I SAY.

320
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,279
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M THINKING?

321
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,781
TEE 'EM UP, BOYS!

322
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,683
TEE 'EM UP.
TEE 'EM UP.
TEE 'EM UP.

323
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,017
GOOD SHOT!
GOOD SHOT!
GOOD SHOT!

324
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:54,019
GOOD SHOT!

325
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,621
[chuckling]

326
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,555
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, DALTON.

327
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,190
YOU HAVE A RAINBOW DAY.

328
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,461
OH, MY.

329
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:09,368
[applause]

330
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,142
BERNICE GAVE ME A
CELL PHONE FOR CHRISTMAS.

331
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,077
I WASN'T THAT EXCITED

332
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:21,246
BECAUSE TO ME A CELL PHONE IS
JUST AN ELECTRONIC LEASH.

333
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,614
NOW, THIS ONE HAS
A SWITCH ON IT

334
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:23,849
WHERE YOU CAN TURN
OFF THE RINGER

335
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:26,785
AND THE UNIT WILL VIBRATE
WHEN YOU'RE GETTING A CALL.

336
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:30,556
NOW, COINCIDENTALLY, I HAD
PULLED A MUSCLE IN THE
SMALL OF MY BACK,

337
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,425
TRYING TO DO UP MY BELT
AFTER A BUFFET DINNER.

338
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:37,029
SO WHAT I DO IS I JUST TAPED
THE CELL PHONE RIGHT OVER
THE SORE SPOT.

339
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:40,199
NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS CALL MYSELF.

340
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:43,435
OH, THAT FEELS --
[vibrating sound]

341
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,572
OH!
[vibrating sound]

342
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:47,940
AND AS LONG AS
I DON'T ANSWER IT,

343
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:48,907
THE CALL IS FREE!

344
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:51,643
OH!
[vibrating sound]

345
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:55,180
I WAS STARTING TO
GET SOME CRAZY IDEAS THERE.

346
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,985
IT WAS THE ROARING '20s.

347
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,920
THE CENTURY HAD JUST
COME OUT OF ITS TEENS,

348
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,557
BUT IT WASN'T READY TO HAVE
CHILDREN  AND SETTLE DOWN JUST YET.

349
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,560
PEOPLE WERE TRYING
ALL KINDS OF NUTBAR STUNTS

350
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,862
JUST TO GET ATTENTION.

351
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,164
THEY WERE RIDING
ON THE HIGH WIRE,

352
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,166
AND WALKING ON AIRPLANE WINGS,

353
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,201
SWALLOWING GOLDFISH.

354
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,971
AROUND HERE, WE HAD
OUR OWN GUY...

355
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:23,275
POSSUM LODGE'S OWN DAREDEVIL,
WALT GORGOVICH.

356
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,845
MY FATHER WOULD
SCARE US SILLY

357
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:30,015
TELLING US STORIES ABOUT SOME
OF WALT'S GOOFIER STUNTS.

358
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:34,686
APPARENTLY, WALT WOULD GATHER A
BUNCH OF BOYS INTO THE KITCHEN

359
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:38,090
TO WATCH HIM STAND IN
FRONT OF A HOT STOVE

360
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,193
AND FRY A POUND OF BACON
WITH NO SHIRT ON!

361
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:48,500
HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST GUYS
TO FIND OUT THAT BACON
WAS BAD FOR YOU.

362
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,903
YEAH, HIS STUNTS KEPT
GETTING WEIRDER.

363
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,504
HE USED TO SWALLOW STUFF...

364
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,607
GOLF BALLS, DOOR HANDLES,

365
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,811
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE
A SMALL APPLIANCE.

366
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,814
THEN THERE WAS THIS
ABANDONED STEAM ENGINE

367
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,283
OUTSIDE OF PORT ASBESTOS.

368
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,919
SO ONE DAY,
WALT SAYS TO MY FATHER,

369
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,721
"I'M GONNA EAT THAT TRAIN."

370
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,660
WALT'S PLAN TO INGEST AN
ENTIRE STEAM ENGINE

371
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,795
WAS A THREAT TO SOME PEOPLE.

372
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:21,100
MY GREAT UNCLE WAS LIVING IN
ONE OF THE BOXCARS AT THE TIME,

373
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,470
AND HE WAS AFRAID THAT WALT
WAS GONNA EAT HIM OUT OF
HOUSE AND HOME.

374
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:28,640
ONE DAY HE SAW WALT TAPPING ON
THE TRAIN REAL NERVOUS LIKE.

375
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,576
SO MY UNCLE ASKS WALT
WHAT'S HE DOING,

376
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:33,479
AND WALT SAYS HE'S
LOOKING FOR A SOFT SPOT.

377
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,882
WALT WAS CRAZY TO TRY
TO EAT THAT TRAIN.

378
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:39,585
I HAD AN UNCLE WHO
TRIED TO DO STUFF LIKE THAT.

379
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:40,886
NOTHING THAT BIG.

380
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,789
OH, HE'D EATEN A
SMALL BICYCLE OR TWO

381
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,424
AND A BUICK CONVERTIBLE.

382
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,526
BUT WHEN WALT BIT
INTO THAT TRAIN,

383
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:51,430
HIS TEETH EXPLODED LIKE A
BALLOON FULL OF CHICLETS.

384
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:54,700
EVERY ONE OF HIS TEETH
HAD TO BE FILLED.

385
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,469
IT BROKE HIS SPIRIT, YOU KNOW.
IT REALLY DID.

386
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,771
HIS DAREDEVIL DAYS WERE OVER.

387
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:05,077
YEAH, MAYBE AT A PARTY
HE'D CHEW ON A BALL
OF ALUMINUM FOIL,

388
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,678
BUT THAT WAS ABOUT IT.

389
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,313
[animal growling]

390
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,517
WHEN WALT GORGOVICH
WAS LYING ON HIS DEATH BED,

391
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,619
A GROUP OF PEOPLE CAME IN
AND TOLD HIM THAT

392
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:16,221
THEY HAD DECLARED
STEAM ENGINES OBSOLETE.

393
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,657
HE CLOSED HIS EYES
AND HE SMILED,

394
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:22,094
AND HE SAID WHAT WERE,
THANKFULLY, HIS LAST WORDS...

395
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:24,463
"NEVER BITE OFF

396
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,298
"MORE THAN YOU
CAN CHEW CHEW."

397
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:31,770
[applause]

398
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,974
NOW, THAT WAS A NIGHTMARE.

399
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:39,211
20 OF US SHOWED UP AT ROCK
CLIFF POINT TO WATCH
THE LUNAR ECLIPSE.

400
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:42,147
JUST A BUNCH OF AIMLESS GUYS
WITH NO ALTERNATIVES,

401
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,149
JUST LIKE OLD TIMES.

402
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,684
[laughter and applause]

403
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:53,926
[cheering and applause]

404
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,328
I DON'T EVER WANNA
DO THAT AGAIN!

405
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:59,798
HOW DID THAT
GO SO WRONG SO FAST?

406
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,266
WELL, YOU WERE PART
OF THE PROBLEM,

407
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,701
BRINGING
THAT MOTORHOME.

408
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,504
WELL, I WAS JUST TRYING TO MAKE
THE GUYS MORE COMFORTABLE.

409
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,105
WELL, I KNOW,
BUT ONCE THEY SAW THAT,

410
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:09,541
THEY DIDN'T WANT
TO GO BACK OUT TO
WATCH THE ECLIPSE.

411
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,044
WELL, WINSTON SAID HE'D HOOK UP
HIS VIDEO CAMERA TO THE TV

412
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,580
SO WE COULD ALL
WATCH FROM INSIDE.

413
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,981
YEAH, WELL, THAT
LASTED THREE MINUTES.

414
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:19,952
EVERYBODY STARTS YELLIN',
"WHAT ELSE IS ON"!

415
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,453
WELL, WE PUT ON
THE BASEBALL GAME,

416
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,722
AND EVERYONE GOT
TIRED AND WENT TO BED.

417
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,525
AND THE BAD NEWS IS
IT WAS ONLY 10:30.

418
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:30,028
WELL, WE HAD TO GET UP EARLY
BECAUSE I HAD TO GET THE
MOTORHOME BACK

419
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:32,164
BEFORE THE DEALERSHIP OPENED.

420
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:38,704
YOU KNOW, I WAS ONLY TRYING
TO RECAPTURE A MOMENT
FROM OUR YOUTH.

421
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,639
THE WHOLE THING
WAS A DISASTER.

422
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,474
YOU CAN'T
GO BACK, RED.

423
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,109
OH, YEAH,
I THINK YOU CAN.

424
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:46,011
NO, THE CONSERVATION AUTHORITY
WAS QUITE CLEAR.

425
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,846
WE CAN'T GO BACK.

426
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:49,982
GEE, I'M SORRY,
Mr GREEN.

427
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,417
I'M SORRY I MISSED
THE LUNAR ECLIPSE.

428
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,152
WELL, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

429
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,754
WHEN MOOSE THOMPSON
DROPPED HIS PANTS,

430
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,156
THAT WAS ENOUGH MOON
TO LAST ME A LIFETIME.

431
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,926
[possum squealing]

432
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,027
MEETING TIME.

433
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,962
YEAH, YOU GO AHEAD, GUYS.
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

434
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,565
UH, IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

435
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,734
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

436
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:11,870
AND I THINK I LEARNED THAT YOU
CAN'T GO BACKWARDS;

437
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,005
YOU NEED TO GO FORWARD.

438
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,440
WHEN I COME HOME TONIGHT I'M
HOPING TO GO FORWARD,

439
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,842
UNLESS YOU THINK
THAT'S TOO FORWARD,

440
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,444
IN WHICH CASE YOU GO INTO
BACKWARD WITH YOUR LIGHTS ON

441
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,380
AND BEEP TWICE.
OKAY!

442
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,348
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

443
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,218
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND
THE WHOLE GANG UP HERE
AT POSSUM LODGE,

444
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:27,719
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

445
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:33,191
[cheering and applause]

446
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,060
SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN NOW.

447
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,495
HAVE A SEAT.

448
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,299
SIT DOWN. EVERYBODY SIT DOWN.

449
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,900
ALL RISE!

450
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,740
QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI.

451
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,975
Red: SIT DOWN.

452
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:54,179
ALL RIGHT, MEN, BOW YOUR HEADS
FOR THE MAN'S PRAYER.

453
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,382
I'M A MAN, BUT I CAN CHANGE,

454
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,519
IF I HAVE TO, I GUESS.

455
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,123
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, NOW, I'M SORRY
WE ALL MISSED THE LUNAR
ECLIPSE LAST NIGHT.

456
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:09,328
BUT APPARENTLY WINSTON TAPED THE
WHOLE DEAL ON HIS VIDEO CAMERA.

457
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,630
HE'S GONNA PLAY THAT TAPE
BACK FOR US RIGHT NOW.

458
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,298
GO AHEAD, WINSTON.

459
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,073
Winston: IS THAT A
LUNAR ECLIPSE?

460
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,942
Red: NO, I BELIEVE THAT'S
A LENS CAP ECLIPSE.
