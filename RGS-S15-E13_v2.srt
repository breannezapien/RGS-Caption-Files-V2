1
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:05,638
You know what this is?

2
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:07,707
It's called
a skeet thrower.

3
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:11,745
It's for hunters who only
like birds that fly in
a straight line.

4
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,714
This would have been real
handy when I had my
paper route.

5
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:18,718
But that's just my
creative side coming out,

6
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:20,386
Bernice hates that.

7
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:23,823
But hey, I've got an even
better use for this thing,

8
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:25,892
every man's dream,

9
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:29,362
an automatic
beverage dispenser.

10
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:32,565
See when I'm out
on the lake fishing,

11
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:34,400
the drinks'll get
warm in the sun

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,336
but if keep the cooler
cool in the shade

13
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:38,037
I've got to bring
the boat back in

14
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:39,806
every time I need a drink.

15
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,574
So in an eight-hour day,

16
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:44,244
that's only going to leave
about 12 minutes for fishing

17
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:46,446
but this rig keeps them cold

18
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,681
and then when I feel
a thirst coming on,

19
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,483
I just pull on
the trigger line

20
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:53,319
and the unit will deliver
the drinks right to me.

21
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,622
When Mohammed can't come
to the Mountain Dew,

22
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:58,458
the Mountain Dew has
to come to Mohammed.

23
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,660
See, I cut a hole in
the bottom of the cooler

24
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,495
and lay the
cans on their side

25
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,130
so they'll roll
out one at a time

26
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,932
and then I've got
this bungee cord

27
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:09,469
to reset the mechanism
after each toss.

28
00:01:10,803 --> 00:01:13,139
And my trigger line
serves a dual purpose,

29
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:15,575
I ran it through an eyelet
on the front of the thrower

30
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,677
so as I move
around the lake,

31
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:20,413
the unit stays
aimed right at me.

32
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,216
You're probably as
impressed with me as I am.

33
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,656
Man, I'm getting thirsty,

34
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,924
oh... waiter...

35
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,196

here to Possum Lodge.

that self-help companies
are a waste of money

You're a pretty good

I didn't want to
overfeed him

Oh, flies.

Yeah, yeah, I always
keep a few on me.

Oh, now you got something
to feed them to.

Rather than desperately
trying to be funny,

00:06:39,464 --> 00:06:41,033
why don't you hold
the box for me.

all right, sure.

is like a filet mignon.

When you're young
you can't sit still

181
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:57,309
because there's a great
big world out there

you can't sit still either

but that's
just the hemorrhoids.

185
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:05,984
The point is, men don't like
to sit still for too long.

186
00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:07,786
Like when you're
driving in the car

you get a charley-horse

I wish I had a nickel for
every time that's happened.

192
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:20,198
So when you're on a
trip wouldn't it be great

193
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:22,834
to be able to stand up
once in a while?

194
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:24,536
The answer is yes.

195
00:08:24,536 --> 00:08:27,272
Real men do lots
of things standing up.

196
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,343
What we need to do
is maximize the leg room

197
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:35,347
and then convert some of
that leg room into head room.

198
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:37,816
That's not going to do it.

199
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:46,925
I took the back seat out

200
00:08:46,925 --> 00:08:49,394
and moved the driver's seat
away from the steering wheel.

201
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:51,930
The downside is, you now
have less room for passengers.

202
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,333
The upside is, you now
have less room for passengers.

203
00:08:56,434 --> 00:08:59,137
That gives us enough floor
space for standing up

204
00:08:59,137 --> 00:09:01,006
but we'll move
the seat forward

205
00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:03,441
so that we can start from
the sitting position

206
00:09:03,441 --> 00:09:05,877
and then just
slide her back

207
00:09:05,877 --> 00:09:07,879
when the sciatica
starts acting up.

208
00:09:10,782 --> 00:09:13,084
Okay, we have a couple
of choices here.

209
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:15,086
You could put blocks
on the pedals

210
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:17,355
like your dad did
with your tricycle

211
00:09:17,355 --> 00:09:19,324
or you could hire
an ex-basketball player

212
00:09:19,324 --> 00:09:20,925
as your chauffeur.

213
00:09:20,925 --> 00:09:23,528
I'm going to go with Plan A.

214
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:25,797
Now we need to
check the headroom.

215
00:09:25,797 --> 00:09:28,666
You want the roof to be
at least six inches
above your head

216
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,935
especially if you
have potholes.

217
00:09:32,337 --> 00:09:35,140
I'm going to need another
two-and-a-half feet
of headroom,

218
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,242
but here again, I only
need the extra height

219
00:09:37,242 --> 00:09:39,043
when I'm standing up.

220
00:09:39,043 --> 00:09:42,781
So what I need is some type
of retractable hydraulic lift.

221
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:44,916
Where am I going to find
something like that?

222
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,118
Oh wait...

223
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:55,093
Now I'll just
cut the roof off

224
00:09:55,093 --> 00:09:57,028
and mount it on
those trunk lifts.

225
00:09:57,028 --> 00:09:59,631
With a brain this big,
you need extra headroom.

226
00:10:06,204 --> 00:10:08,339
Great, cordless saw.

227
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:27,358
Maybe I should have done
this with a convertible

228
00:10:27,358 --> 00:10:29,160
but we're good to go.

229
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,296
I've got my roof mounted
on my trunk-raising mechanism

230
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:33,364
so now, when I get
tired of sitting,

231
00:10:33,364 --> 00:10:35,199
I just slap her
into cruise control,

232
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:38,503
slide the seat back and press
the trunk release button,

233
00:10:38,503 --> 00:10:40,438
which is my way of
raising the roof.

234
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:44,275
Then I just stand up until
the feeling comes back
into my legs.

235
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,445
Now, I was going to wear
sunglasses to keep the

236
00:10:47,445 --> 00:10:49,580
bugs out of my eyes
but I put them in the trunk

237
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,050
and it doesn't
open anymore.

238
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,919
Other than that, we're
ready for a test drive.

239
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,821
So remember, if the women
don't find you handsome,

240
00:10:56,821 --> 00:10:59,357
they should at least
find you handy.

to a long trip

them clean and pressed.

314
00:14:34,538 --> 00:14:36,340
You don't seem
yourself at all.

315
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,441
Yes, I know.

316
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:38,776
Yes, Anne-Marie
noticed that too.

317
00:14:38,776 --> 00:14:41,779
She gave me kind of a
funny look at breakfast
this morning

318
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:46,717
so I'm going to save
my energy all day
just in case.

319
00:14:46,717 --> 00:14:49,887
Well, see you
boys later.

320

Where are you taking
the ladies, Mr. Humphrey?

321
00:14:52,256 --> 00:14:53,390
To my store.

322
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,092
I've got a free
gift and a corsage

323
00:14:55,092 --> 00:14:58,595
for anyone who
spends over $200.

324
00:14:58,595 --> 00:15:00,864
You know, some
of the ladies say

325
00:15:00,864 --> 00:15:04,601
I look a little bit
like Jack Nicholson.

326
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:07,371
Boy, they're really
getting to you,
aren't they?

327
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:10,541
Red, they make me want
to be a better salesman.

328
00:15:17,514 --> 00:15:19,283
RED: Bill had decided to
spend a day out on the lake

329
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:21,852
in a little home-made
boat that he made.

330
00:15:21,852 --> 00:15:24,221
He tied her up not
only to the dock

331
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:28,592
but apparently
to his own leg.

332
00:15:28,592 --> 00:15:30,294
Away you go, all right.

333
00:15:30,294 --> 00:15:32,329
And a little picnic
area we have

334
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:34,198
down near the edge
of the water there.

335
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:35,499
Bill was taking all of it.

336
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:37,167
Bill doesn't like to
make a lot of trips

337
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:39,436
so he likes to try to
take everything at once.

338
00:15:39,436 --> 00:15:40,470
I mean that's the plan.

339
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:44,208
It doesn't all make it
to the destination.

340
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:47,811
Bill hasn't grasped the
concept of gravity just yet.

341
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:49,246
So by the time he gets
down to the dock

342
00:15:49,246 --> 00:15:50,781
there's not too much left

343
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:52,983
but at least he can go
fishing, you know.

344
00:15:52,983 --> 00:15:54,384
So he jumps into the boat

345
00:15:54,384 --> 00:15:56,019
and he's going to get
ready to paddle off

346
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:58,055
and he notices the oars --
the oars are gone, Bill.

347
00:15:58,055 --> 00:16:00,290
No oars.

348
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,025
Doesn't quite know
what happened there

349
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:03,393
but don't
worry about it.

350
00:16:03,393 --> 00:16:04,494
Just go get a paddle.

351
00:16:04,494 --> 00:16:05,996
Go on get a paddle,
all right.

352
00:16:05,996 --> 00:16:07,397
Away you go.

353
00:16:07,397 --> 00:16:08,865
You know, sometimes you can
be looking for something

354
00:16:08,865 --> 00:16:11,768
and you can't see it and it
jumps straight up
and bites you.

355
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:13,437
Okay, there's your paddle.

356
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:14,671
Now he goes back.

357
00:16:14,671 --> 00:16:16,640
Now at least you can get
going, get your day
of fishing in.

358
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,108
And he sits down.

359
00:16:18,108 --> 00:16:20,444
Now he's got no seat
in the boat.

360
00:16:20,444 --> 00:16:21,979
So he's starting to think,

361
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:23,814
what the heck is going
on around here?

362
00:16:23,814 --> 00:16:25,382
Things are like,
disappearing like crazy.

363
00:16:25,382 --> 00:16:27,150
Well, you got a lawn chair,
go get a lawn chair.

364
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,653
You got to adapt in life.
You've got to go with the flow.

365
00:16:29,653 --> 00:16:31,488
Oh, oh, oh...

366
00:16:31,488 --> 00:16:32,956
All right, that'll be fine.

367
00:16:32,956 --> 00:16:34,624
You can sit on that.
You've got your paddle.

368
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:36,059
You should be fine.

369
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:38,895
So he jumps in the boat and...

370
00:16:38,895 --> 00:16:42,199
Now we've got no
floor in the boat

371
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:45,068
so now he goes back,
gets the cooler

372
00:16:45,068 --> 00:16:46,737
and now when he comes
down to the dock,

373
00:16:46,737 --> 00:16:50,640
he sees that the sides
and the transom are
missing from the boat

374
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,009
and he's so struck with that

375
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:56,413
that he doesn't notice the
whole dock is also missing.

376
00:16:56,413 --> 00:17:00,117
Something very, very
strange is going on.

377
00:17:00,117 --> 00:17:02,385
So he's just got to --

378
00:17:02,385 --> 00:17:03,987
Bill -- Bill just sit down,

379
00:17:03,987 --> 00:17:06,790
take a deep breath
and re-group.

380
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:10,660
I'm not sure that's
a complete chair, Bill.

381
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,964
Boy oh boy,

382
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:17,400
this is starting to
feel a bit like the
Twilight Zone for Bill

383
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,902
and he takes the cooler up

384
00:17:18,902 --> 00:17:22,038
and that's not a
complete table either

385
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:24,241
and now he's starting
to really panic.

386
00:17:24,241 --> 00:17:25,942
Like something
weird is going on.

387
00:17:25,942 --> 00:17:28,311
There's the barrel,
what happened there?

388
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:31,414
and the picket fence is gone

389
00:17:31,414 --> 00:17:33,583
and this is just very odd.

390
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,819
So he decides just to go
home and just maybe
have a little sleep

391
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:38,221
and maybe this was all
a dream of some kind.

392
00:17:38,221 --> 00:17:41,157
And he gets there and he sees
that his mailbox is okay

393
00:17:41,157 --> 00:17:42,993
but there's no post

394
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:44,528
and this is very odd.

395
00:17:44,528 --> 00:17:45,996
And then he pulls up
in front of the house,

396
00:17:45,996 --> 00:17:48,398
and the house is okay

397
00:17:48,398 --> 00:17:52,502
but the dog house
doesn't look quite right.

398
00:17:52,502 --> 00:17:55,272
I don't think it's a
complete dog house.

399
00:17:55,272 --> 00:17:59,342
You know, this was just
a complete misunderstanding

400

I know they used to call
this vandalism

but since about '97, I
believe it's called recycling.

Could someone please
explain to me

406
00:18:22,832 --> 00:18:25,869
why a bag of snacks
has to be welded shut?

407
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:28,471
During the playoffs a
man could starve to death.

408
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:30,807
Luckily, I have
an easy solution.

409
00:18:30,807 --> 00:18:32,575
Remember in science class,

410
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,711
there was a thing
called a bell jar?

411
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:36,246
Me neither.

412
00:18:36,246 --> 00:18:39,416
But apparently they
would put a ringing bell
inside a glass jar

413
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,684
and then suck all the
air out of the space,

414
00:18:41,684 --> 00:18:45,055
kind of what Harold does
during a conversation.

415
00:18:45,055 --> 00:18:47,357
Once the air was out of
there, you had a vacuum,

416
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:49,459
you couldn't hear
the bell anymore.

417
00:18:49,459 --> 00:18:51,161
No such luck with Harold.

418
00:18:51,161 --> 00:18:53,463
But I figure we can use
that same technology

419
00:18:53,463 --> 00:18:55,465
to open our bag of snacks,

420
00:18:55,465 --> 00:18:57,567
because inside here
we've got air pressure,

421
00:18:57,567 --> 00:18:59,636
and as soon as it
goes into a vacuum,

422
00:18:59,636 --> 00:19:01,738
something's gotta give.

423
00:19:01,738 --> 00:19:03,339
You don't need a
bell jar either,

424
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:04,774
just something air tight

425
00:19:04,774 --> 00:19:06,509
and I don't mean an alibi,

426
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:09,512
I'm thinking diving helmet.

427
00:19:09,512 --> 00:19:13,116
And you set the whole unit
down on a rubber car floormat,

428
00:19:13,116 --> 00:19:17,253
smooth side up so
you get a good seal.

429
00:19:17,253 --> 00:19:20,023
Okay, then you hook up a
heavy-duty industrial

vacuum cleaner to
the breather pipe
