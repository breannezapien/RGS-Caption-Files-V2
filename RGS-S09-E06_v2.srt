158
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,740
WE WERE MILES AWAY FROM
THE NEAREST HOSPITAL,

159
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:51,176
SO THEY TOOK ME TO
THE NEAREST RESTAURANT,

160
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:54,079
WHERE THEY HAD A CHEF PUT
A METAL PLATE IN MY HEAD.

161
00:06:54,146 --> 00:06:56,014
A REAL METAL PLATE.

162
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:57,816
IT WAS HANGING
ABOVE THE STOVE.

163
00:06:57,883 --> 00:07:00,118
I THINK, ACTUALLY,
IT WAS A STRAINER.

164
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:02,988
YEAH, I WISH I HAD
ONE OF THOSE RIGHT NOW.

165
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,556
SOMEHOW, OVER THE YEARS,

166
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:06,758
I THINK THAT
METAL PLATE IN MY HEAD

167
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:08,994
HAS BECOME MAGNETIZED.

168
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,929
HAP, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

169
00:07:10,996 --> 00:07:13,332
EVEN IN YOUR WORLD.

170
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:15,634
THAT SO?

171
00:07:17,235 --> 00:07:18,970
YOU THINK THAT'S
MAGNETISM HOLDING
THAT ON?

172
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:20,539
YES, I DO.

173
00:07:20,572 --> 00:07:22,374
HAP, THAT'S AN
ALUMINUM POP CAN.

174
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:24,676
ALUMINUM'S
NOT MAGNETIC.

175
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,145
IT'S A DIFFERENT
KIND OF MAGNETISM.

176
00:07:27,212 --> 00:07:29,881
YEAH,
I'M SURE IT IS.

177
00:07:29,948 --> 00:07:31,883
I BELIEVE IT'S
CALLED GUM.

178
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:33,618
TAKE A LOOK.

179
00:07:33,652 --> 00:07:35,454
I CAN'T LOOK
AT IT, RED.
WHY NOT?

180
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,223
MY HEAD ONLY
POINTS NORTH.

181
00:07:50,268 --> 00:07:53,472
THIS WEEK ON
HANDYMAN CORNER,

182
00:07:53,805 --> 00:07:55,507
I'M GOING TO GIVE
YOU YOUNG PEOPLE

183
00:07:55,574 --> 00:07:58,076
A HISTORY LESSON
AND A LIFE LESSON;

184
00:07:58,143 --> 00:08:00,745
UNLESS YOU HAVE STAPLED SO
MUCH JEWELLERY TO YOUR HEAD

185
00:08:00,812 --> 00:08:04,783
THAT YOU CAN'T HOLD IT
HIGH ENOUGH TO SEE THE TV.

186
00:08:05,116 --> 00:08:09,020
THIS UNIT HERE IS AN OLD,
WRINGER-WASHER CLOTHES
WASHING MACHINE.

187
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:11,122
TECHNOLOGY HASN'T REALLY
CHANGED ALL THAT MUCH.

188
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:12,757
STILL GOT AN
AGITATOR IN THERE,

189
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,993
YOU PUT YOUR DETERGENT,
YOUR WATER, AND YOUR CLOTHES --.

190
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,436
I GOT A REAL GOOD
FEELING ABOUT THIS.

191
00:08:24,736 --> 00:08:26,705
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
TO EMPTY THE MACHINE OUT,

192
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:29,975
WHAT YOU WOULD DO IS
TAKE THIS HOSE AND HOOK
IT ONTO YOUR LAUNDRY TUB,

193
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,844
AND THEN YOU PUSH
THIS KNOB HERE.

194
00:08:32,911 --> 00:08:34,746
WHOA.
MAN.

195
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:37,549
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
THIS IS WHERE IT
GETS REAL INTERESTING.

196
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:40,452
TO SQUEEZE THE WATER
OUT OF THE CLOTHES,

197
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:42,153
THAT'S WHERE THE
WRINGER COMES IN.

198
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:44,389
YOU WOULD JUST FEED THE
CLOTHES THROUGH THE WRINGER,

199
00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:45,957
AND YOU WOULD GET
ENOUGH WATER OUT,

200
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:48,793
YOU COULD THEN HANG
THEM OUT ON THE LINE TO DRY.

201
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,596
THE DANGER WAS THAT YOU LEAN IN
SO CLOSE TO THE RINGER,

202
00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:54,966
YOU MIGHT GET YOUR TIE
OR YOUR NOSE HAIRS
CAUGHT IN THERE.

203
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:59,070
SO TECHNOLOGY MOVED ON.

204
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:02,340
NOW MY WIFE WANTS ME TO
THROW THIS OLD THING OUT.

205
00:09:02,407 --> 00:09:04,009
BUT IF SHE HAD HER WAY,

206
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:06,711
WE ALSO WOULD'VE THROWN OUT
THOSE OLD OIL DRUMS SITTIN'
ON THE BACK PORCH.

207
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:08,813
THEN WHERE WOULD WE BE

208
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:10,782
WHEN WE NEEDED
AN OLD OIL DRUM?

209
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:12,550
THAT'S WHERE THE
LIFE LESSON COMES IN.

210
00:09:12,617 --> 00:09:14,152
RECYCLE.

211
00:09:14,185 --> 00:09:15,587
GET CREATIVE.

212
00:09:15,653 --> 00:09:17,822
BREAK NEW GROUND.

213
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:22,494
USE YOUR NOGGIN TO FIND A
NEW WAY TO USE AN OLD THING.

214
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:25,864
YOU MARRIED GUYS KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

215
00:09:26,197 --> 00:09:29,134
I'M GOING TO USE THE
AGITATOR TO MIX UP THE
OLD CANS OF PAINT.

216
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,668
AND THE COLOUR
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

217
00:09:30,735 --> 00:09:33,238
WE'RE ONLY PAINTING THE
FENCE, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

218
00:09:33,304 --> 00:09:34,739
AND YOU SEE WHAT
I'VE DONE HERE?

219
00:09:34,806 --> 00:09:36,341
I MOUNTED THESE
SHOWER HEADS

220
00:09:36,374 --> 00:09:39,210
THE SAME DISTANCE APART
AS THE FENCE BOARDS.

221
00:09:39,277 --> 00:09:41,746
SEE, THEN WHEN I PUSH IN THE
KNOB TO DRAIN THE MACHINE,

222
00:09:41,813 --> 00:09:44,549
THE PAINTS GOING TO SPRAY
OUT THESE SHOWER NOZZLES.

223
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:46,084
SEE WHAT I'VE DONE?

224
00:09:46,151 --> 00:09:48,186
I'VE TURNED A USELESS
OLD WRINGER-WASHER,

225
00:09:48,219 --> 00:09:50,488
INTO A FENCE PAINTER
THAT DOESN'T USE A BRUSH

226
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:52,357
AND ALMOST NEVER
NEEDS PAINT.

227
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,925
NOW, HERE'S A BONUS.

228
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,661
IF YOU TIE A PIECE OF ROPE TO
THE OTHER END OF THE FENCE,

229
00:09:56,694 --> 00:10:00,265
AND YOU RUN IT THROUGH
THE RINGER LIKE THAT.

230
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:03,434
THE WHOLE UNIT
BECOMES SELF PROPELLED.

231
00:10:23,688 --> 00:10:25,089
SO REMEMBER,

232
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:27,091
IF THE WOMEN DON'T
FIND YOU HANDSOME,

233
00:10:27,158 --> 00:10:29,427
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

234
00:10:44,108 --> 00:10:45,910
I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU OLDER GUYS

235
00:10:45,977 --> 00:10:48,079
WHO AT ONE TIME OR
ANOTHER MAY HAVE SAID,

236
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:50,615
YOU KNOW, I FORGOT WHAT
I WAS GOING TO SAY.

237
00:10:50,682 --> 00:10:53,551
YOU MAY THINK THAT'S
SENILITY, BUT IT IS NOT.

238
00:10:53,584 --> 00:10:55,620
IT IS VERY GOOD HEALTH.

239
00:10:55,653 --> 00:10:58,556
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT A
FEW STORIES YOU'VE TOLD
A TIME OR TWO OVER --

240
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:00,224
YOU KNOW THE KIND
OF STORIES I MEAN.

241
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,260
NO, NO, NOT THAT KIND.

242
00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:03,594
I MEAN THE KIND THAT --.

243
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:05,129
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE KIND
YOU WOULD TELL YOUR WIFE.

244
00:11:05,163 --> 00:11:06,731
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU --

245
00:11:06,764 --> 00:11:08,566
YOU JUST GET STARTED
INTO THE STORY,

246
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:10,568
AND YOU LOOK AT YOUR FRIENDS,
AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT
THEIR WATCH, EH.

247
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:12,670
AND THEN THEY START CHECKING
THAT THEIR WATCH IS WORKING.

248
00:11:12,704 --> 00:11:16,507
AND THEY START USING THEIR WATCH
TO CHECK THEIR OWN PULSE.

249
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,643
YOU GLANCE OVER TO YOUR
WIFE FOR SOME SUPPORT,

250
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:23,448
AND SHE'S STARRING AT YOU
LIKE YOU'RE THE SOURCE OF
THE BAD SMELL IN THE FRIDGE.

251
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:25,183
THESE PEOPLE
AREN'T FEELING WELL.

252
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:26,851
THEY HAVE A DISEASE
CALLED BOREDOM,

253
00:11:26,884 --> 00:11:30,321
AND AT THAT MOMENT,
YOU ARE THE CARRIER.

254
00:11:30,388 --> 00:11:34,025
YOU ARE THE TYPHOID MARY OF
MONOTONY, I'LL TELL YOU.

255
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:35,793
AND I'LL TELL YOU THE
MOST DANGEROUS THING,

256
00:11:35,827 --> 00:11:40,064
YOU RUN THE RISK OF
BORING YOURSELF TO DEATH.

257
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:42,533
YOU'RE SUBCONSCIOUS
KNOWS THAT, SEE.

258
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:44,035
SO WHAT IT DOES IS

259
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:45,503
YOU GET INTO ONE
OF THOSE STORIES,

260
00:11:45,536 --> 00:11:48,172
IT RAISES THE DRAW BRIDGE
BETWEEN THAT STORY,

261
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:50,508
AND YOUR MOUTH.

262
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:54,612
SHUTS THE WHOLE THING DOWN,
JUST LIKE THE TEAMSTERS.

263
00:11:54,912 --> 00:11:56,380
AND IF YOU NEED
SOME PROOF,

264
00:11:56,447 --> 00:11:57,849
NEXT TIME YOU BLURT OUT,

265
00:11:57,915 --> 00:11:59,750
"I FORGOT WHAT I
WAS GOING TO SAY,"

266
00:11:59,784 --> 00:12:01,919
JUST LOOK AT THE LOOKS
OF JOY AND RELIEF

267
00:12:01,986 --> 00:12:04,655
ON THE FACES OF
YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY,

268
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:08,025
AND IN THE DEEP RECESSES
OF YOUR OWN MIND.

269
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:10,261
REMEMBER,
I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

270
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:12,797
WELL, FORGOT WHAT I
WAS GONNA SAY.

271
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:21,672
EVERYBODY THESE DAYS WANTS AN
INTERLOCKING BRICK DRIVEWAY.

272
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:23,841
SETS THE PLACE
OFF REAL NICE.

273
00:12:23,874 --> 00:12:25,409
AND IT DOESN'T
JUST SAY MONEY,

274
00:12:25,476 --> 00:12:27,945
IT SAYS INTERLOCKING MONEY.

275
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:31,716
SO HERE'S A CHEAP WAY TO HAVE
YOURSELF AN INTERLOCKING
BRICK DRIVEWAY.

276
00:12:33,384 --> 00:12:35,052
BEFORE YOU
POUR YOUR CEMENT,

277
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:39,190
YOU LAY DOWN A TIGHT GRIDWORK OF
PRIMER CORD INSIDE THE AREA.

278
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:44,862
I WOULD RECOMMEND NOT SMOKING
WHILE YOU'RE DOING THIS.

279
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:47,098
YOU WILL BE SMOKING LONG
AFTER YOU ARE DONE.

280
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:53,037
AND THEN,

281
00:12:57,475 --> 00:13:00,111
YOU JUST SPREAD IT
SMOOTHLY OVER THE GRID.

282
00:13:08,185 --> 00:13:10,955
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A SAYING
IN THE DEMOLITIONS BUSINESS,

283
00:13:10,988 --> 00:13:15,092
WHAT DOESN'T KILL ME,
MAKES ME HARD OF HEARING.

284
00:13:15,426 --> 00:13:19,063
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE
HAVE NO COMMON SENSE.

285
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:23,934
MAYBE WE BETTER TAKE COVER
BEHIND THIS PROTECTIVE BARRIER.

286
00:13:31,675 --> 00:13:34,345
[ APPLAUSE ]

287
00:13:34,378 --> 00:13:37,014
[ SOUND OF FIRE EXTINGUISHER ]

288
00:13:38,516 --> 00:13:39,950
OKAY, UM --

289
00:13:39,984 --> 00:13:42,119
WELL, WE'RE GETTING THERE,
YOU KNOW, UH --

290
00:13:42,186 --> 00:13:45,422
ACTUALLY, WHEN WE WELDED THE
STORM DOORS ONTO THE FLOOR
OF THE SCHOOL BUS,

291
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:48,058
WE FORGOT TO ALLOW
FOR THE FLAMMABILITY

292
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:51,795
OF ALL THE STUFF THE KIDS
HAVE DROPPED UNDER THE SEATS
OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS.

293
00:13:51,862 --> 00:13:53,664
THERE WAS LUNCH BAGS,
EXPLODING PENS,

294
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:55,332
PORTABLE NUCLEAR DEVICES.

295
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,934
IT WAS A MESS --

296
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:58,469
OKAY, Mr. GREEN,
IT'S STILL SMOKIN',

297
00:13:58,536 --> 00:14:01,338
BUT THE REALLY BAD SMELL IS
STARTING TO DIE DOWN NOW.

298
00:14:01,405 --> 00:14:05,476
YOU KNOW, RED, I THINK YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO GIVE THIS WHOLE
BOAT THING A RE-THINK.

299
00:14:05,543 --> 00:14:09,013
I'M WAY PAST
THE BOAT IDEA.

300
00:14:09,046 --> 00:14:11,482
NOW, DID YOU GUYS
NOTICE WHAT HAPPENED,

301
00:14:11,515 --> 00:14:13,784
WHEN THE FLOOR CAUGHT
ON FIRE IN THE BUS?

302
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:16,520
YEAH, YOU MEAN THE WAY THE FIRE
DEPARTMENT REFUSED TO COME?

303
00:14:16,587 --> 00:14:18,088
NO, NO, NO.

304
00:14:18,155 --> 00:14:19,890
I MEAN, DID YOU
NOTICE THE WHOLE BUS

305
00:14:19,924 --> 00:14:21,692
KINDA ROSE UP
A LITTLE BIT.

306
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:23,427
NO.

307
00:14:23,494 --> 00:14:25,129
YOU KNOW, IT WAS OKAY FOR
YOU TO SMELL THE SMOKE.

308
00:14:25,195 --> 00:14:27,197
I JUST DON'T THINK YOU
SHOULD HAVE INHALED.

309
00:14:27,231 --> 00:14:30,234
NO, ALL THE HOT AIR,
ALL THE HOT GASES

310
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:32,036
TRAPPED INSIDE
THE ROOF.

311
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:34,371
HOT AIR RISES, THAT'S WHY
THEY HAVE HOT AIR BALLOONS.

312
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:36,573
AND, OF COURSE,
THE SCHOOL BUS IS
MADE OUT OF ALUMINUM.

313
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,342
SHE'S GOT NO ENGINE,
NO TRANSMISSION,

314
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,377
SO SHE'S KINDA LIGHT,
AND UP SHE COMES.

315
00:14:40,411 --> 00:14:41,912
SEE WHERE I'M
GOING WITH THIS?

316
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:44,348
YEAH, THE PRISON HOSPITAL.

317
00:14:44,648 --> 00:14:46,684
NO, NO, IF WE CAN
LIGHTEN THE SCHOOL
BUS EVEN MORE,

318
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,786
TAKE THE WHEELS OFF,
TAKE THE BUMPERS OFF,

319
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:50,354
START A FIRE INSIDE,

320
00:14:50,387 --> 00:14:51,955
HEY,
WHAT DO WE HAVE?

321
00:14:52,022 --> 00:14:54,058
A GREAT BIG
ALUMINUM HOT THING?

322
00:14:54,124 --> 00:14:56,226
NO, NO.
NO, NO!

323
00:14:56,293 --> 00:14:59,430
WE'LL HAVE AN ORANGE
ALUMINUM AIR SHIP.

324
00:14:59,463 --> 00:15:01,198
IT'LL BE LIKE
THE GOODYEAR BLIMP,

325
00:15:01,231 --> 00:15:03,934
BUT IT WILL
BE A SCHOOL BUS.

326
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:05,502
IS THAT GOOD?

327
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:07,137
WELL, YEAH!

328
00:15:07,204 --> 00:15:08,872
'CAUSE WE'LL HAVE
ALL THOSE SEATS.

329
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:10,340
WE CAN ALL RIDE
AROUND IN THERE.

330
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:12,276
WE CAN CONTROL THE
ALTITUDE BY HOW HOT
WE MAKE THE FIRE.

331
00:15:12,342 --> 00:15:15,279
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST TRYIN'
TO FIGURE OUT, UM --

332
00:15:15,312 --> 00:15:17,414
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THIS IDEA.

333
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:19,149
OH, YEAH.
I REMEMBER NOW.

334
00:15:19,216 --> 00:15:21,051
WE'LL ALL BE KILLED!

335
00:15:21,084 --> 00:15:22,753
NO, I'LL TELL
YOU WHAT WE'LL DO.

336
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,088
WE'LL JUST FLOAT
AROUND, MAYBE A FEW
FEET ABOVE THE GROUND,

337
00:15:25,122 --> 00:15:26,657
JUST TO BE SURE
WE'RE SAFE.

338
00:15:26,723 --> 00:15:29,193
WELL, WHAT ABOUT OTHER
AIRCRAFT BUMPING INTO US?

339
00:15:29,226 --> 00:15:31,061
THAT WOULD
BE INCONVENIENT.

340
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:32,796
IT'S A SCHOOL BUS!

341
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,898
WHEN WE SEE 'EM COMING,
WE'LL JUST FLICK ON
THE FLASHING LIGHTS.

342
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:36,400
THEY'LL HAVE TO STOP.

343
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:46,243
Red:
SO WE'RE GONNA PLAY GOLF.
JUST WAITIN' FOR MIKE.

344
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:50,214
OH, BOY.

345
00:15:50,247 --> 00:15:51,615
OKAY, WE'RE ALL
SET TO TEE UP.

346
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:54,318
I GOT ALL OF THAT.
ALL RIGHT.

347
00:15:54,384 --> 00:15:56,687
HEY, GIVE ME FIVE.

348
00:15:56,753 --> 00:15:58,589
ALL RIGHT, MIKE.
GIVE 'ER A GO.

349
00:15:58,655 --> 00:16:00,057
GIVE 'ER A GO.

350
00:16:00,123 --> 00:16:02,492
HE'S LITTLE, BUT HE'S GOT
QUITE AN UNUSUAL SWING.

351
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,895
I THINK HE PICKED
IT UP IN PRISON.

352
00:16:04,928 --> 00:16:06,096
ALL RIGHT, MIKE.
GIVE --

353
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:07,664
OH, THERE WE GO.

354
00:16:07,731 --> 00:16:09,466
OKAY, GIVE 'ER A GO.
WE DON'T COUNT THAT.

355
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:11,468
THERE IT GOES.
OH, OH, OH!

356
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:13,804
OH, THAT'S A SH --

357
00:16:13,837 --> 00:16:16,306
NO, GOOD.
IT WAS GOOD.

358
00:16:17,641 --> 00:16:19,876
ALL RIGHT.
HERE'S THE TANDEM PAIRS.

359
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,745
DON'T SEE THIS TOO OFTEN.

360
00:16:21,812 --> 00:16:23,413
WE WERE PLAYIN'
A LITTLE SLOW, SO --

361
00:16:23,447 --> 00:16:26,216
A COUPLE OF BEAUTIES!
COUPLE OF BEAUTIES.

362
00:16:26,249 --> 00:16:28,652
I THINK ONE OF THEM
ACTUALLY OUTDROVE ME.

363
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:31,788
SO WE PICK UP OUR GEAR.
MIKE'S GONNA GO IN THE CART.

364
00:16:31,855 --> 00:16:34,224
NO, THIS WAY, MIKE.
THIS WAY.

365
00:16:34,257 --> 00:16:38,695
SO WE'RE GONNA WALK DOWN TO OU
DRIVES FOR OUR SECOND SHOT.

366
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:45,035
WHO'S AWAY?
WHO'S AWAY.

367
00:16:45,102 --> 00:16:47,237
MIKE GOES TO GET HIS BALL.

368
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,573
MIKE THAT'S NOT --
THAT'S NOT --

369
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:51,308
NOT REALLY IN THE RULE --
NOT REALLY --

370
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:53,176
HI, MIKE!

371
00:16:57,714 --> 00:17:00,751
YES, THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

372
00:17:01,051 --> 00:17:02,319
SO NOW WE GOT
A LITTLE THING GOING.

373
00:17:02,385 --> 00:17:03,920
THIS IS OUR APPROACH SHOT
INTO THE GREEN.

374
00:17:03,987 --> 00:17:05,489
WINSTON'S THE FIRST ONE UP,

375
00:17:05,522 --> 00:17:07,424
AND HE HITS
A REAL NICE SHOT HERE.

376
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:09,159
NOW HE'S ONE OF THOSE GUYS
HITS ONE GOOD SHOT,

377
00:17:09,226 --> 00:17:10,560
AND LOOK AT THAT, EH.

378
00:17:10,627 --> 00:17:13,063
NOW HE'S ALL Mr. BIG.

379
00:17:13,096 --> 00:17:14,531
HE DIGS OUT HIS WALLET,
AND HE SAYS,

380
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:18,869
"HEY, GUYS, I GOT 10 BUCKS SAY
THAT'S CLOSEST TO THE PIN."

381
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:20,737
OH, FELLA BACK THERE
CUTTIN' THE LAWN.

382
00:17:20,804 --> 00:17:22,806
TEN BUCKS, OKAY.
YEAH, WE GOT IT.

383
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,474
BIG DEAL.
OKAY.

384
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,210
ALL RIGHT, I'M IN.
I'M ALWAYS IN.

385
00:17:27,244 --> 00:17:29,913
MIKE'S GOT A PRETTY GOOD
WAD OF CASH THERE.

386
00:17:29,946 --> 00:17:31,815
MUST'VE BEEN PAYDAY.

387
00:17:31,882 --> 00:17:33,650
OH!

388
00:17:33,683 --> 00:17:36,920
YEAH, DALTON'S WALLET HASN'T
BEEN OPENED IN A WHILE.

389
00:17:36,953 --> 00:17:41,791
BUT GOOD TO SEE HE'S
IN FOR THE TEN.

390
00:17:41,825 --> 00:17:44,494
ALL RIGHT, WHO'S UP?
WHO'S UP NEXT?

391
00:17:44,561 --> 00:17:46,796
I DON'T WANNA GO RIGHT NOW.
SOMEONE ELSE GO.

392
00:17:46,863 --> 00:17:49,299
MIKE, YOU GO.
GIVE 'ER A GO.

393
00:17:49,366 --> 00:17:50,533
THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.

394
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,302
THAT'S A NICE ONE.
THAT'S A NICE ONE.

395
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:54,037
OKAY!
WINSTON'S OUTTA THE MONEY.

396
00:17:54,104 --> 00:17:55,572
THAT'S GOOD.

397
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:57,173
ALL RIGHT, DALTON.

398
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,442
OH, MAN.
HOLY SMOKES.

399
00:17:59,476 --> 00:18:01,544
ALL RIGHT, DALTON.
LOOSEN UP THAT SWING.

400
00:18:01,578 --> 00:18:03,079
LET 'ER RIP.

401
00:18:03,146 --> 00:18:05,081
OH, HEY.
NOT BAD.
NOT BAD.

402
00:18:05,115 --> 00:18:06,950
OH, BOY, THIS IS
GONNA BE TOUGH.

403
00:18:06,983 --> 00:18:09,552
THIS IS GONNA BE TOUGH.

404
00:18:09,586 --> 00:18:12,689
ALL RIGHT, I GOTTA REALLY
THINK ABOUT THIS ONE.

405
00:18:12,756 --> 00:18:14,257
OH, OH, STRAIGHT UP.

406
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,592
SKIED IT.
SKIED IT.

407
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,394
LOOK OUT, GUYS.
LOOK OUT.

408
00:18:17,427 --> 00:18:18,862
GET AWAY FROM
THE MONEY, DALTON.

409
00:18:18,928 --> 00:18:20,530
INCOMING!
INCOMING!

410
00:18:20,597 --> 00:18:21,865
LOOK OUT!
LOOK OUT!

411
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:24,167
OH, BOY.

00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,568
WHAT'S HE DOING?

413
00:18:25,635 --> 00:18:26,836
OH, LOOK OUT.

414
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,338
OH.

415
00:18:28,405 --> 00:18:31,341
ALL RIGHT!
THERE WE GO.

416
00:18:31,374 --> 00:18:33,343
OKAY.

417
00:18:37,347 --> 00:18:39,983
YOU KNOW, SPENDING
QUALITY TIME WITH
THE YOUNGSTER

418
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:44,521
DOESN'T MEAN YOU ALWAYS
HAVE TO BE RISKING LIVES AND
DESTROYING THE ENVIRONMENT.

419
00:18:44,554 --> 00:18:46,556
TEACH THEM SOME
GENTLE SKILLS,

420
00:18:46,623 --> 00:18:49,459
LIKE HOW TO BUILD
AND FLY A KITE.

421
00:18:49,526 --> 00:18:52,128
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS KITE'S GONNA
GO A MILE HIGH.

422
00:18:52,162 --> 00:18:54,998
YEAH, YOU'LL SEE.

423
00:18:55,331 --> 00:18:57,901
YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER
WATCHIN' MY DAD BUILD KITES.

424
00:18:57,934 --> 00:18:59,669
THAT WAS SOMETHING.

425
00:18:59,702 --> 00:19:02,038
I GUESS THAT'S WHERE
I LEARNED MOST OF
MY SWEAR WORDS.

426
00:19:02,071 --> 00:19:04,674
THAT WAY,
DAD'S ALWAYS WITH ME,

427
00:19:04,707 --> 00:19:07,310
INSTEAD OF IN A
CONDO IN FLORIDA.

428
00:19:07,343 --> 00:19:08,478
YOU KNOW WHAT?

429
00:19:08,511 --> 00:19:09,979
YOU'RE GONNA
REMEMBER THIS DAY

430
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:12,148
FOR A LONG,
LONG, LONG TIME.

431
00:19:12,182 --> 00:19:15,552
YOU SEE, IT'S NOT WHAT
YOU DO WITH THE CHILD --

432
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:18,421
AH! AH!

433
00:19:20,623 --> 00:19:22,025
WE DON'T NEED THAT.
WE DON'T NEED THAT.

434
00:19:22,091 --> 00:19:23,593
THAT'S OKAY.
THAT'S OKAY.

435
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,861
THERE YOU GO.

436
00:19:24,928 --> 00:19:26,196
THAT'LL STILL FLY.
THAT'LL STILL FLY.

437
00:19:26,262 --> 00:19:28,898
GO ON, NOW.

438
00:19:28,932 --> 00:19:30,400
NOT GONNA FLY
IF YOU JUST STAND THERE.

439
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:32,168
YOU GOTTA RUN!
YOU GOTTA RUN!

440
00:19:32,235 --> 00:19:35,138
GO ON, RUN!
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!

441
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:37,373
THERE HE GOES.
WHAT A LITTLE GUY, HUH?

442
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,409
SOME DAY HE'LL HAVE
A BOY OF HIS OWN,

443
00:19:39,475 --> 00:19:41,244
AND HE'LL TAKE HIM
OUT KITE FLYING,

444
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:44,414
AND HE'LL REMEMBER
THIS DAY.

445
00:19:44,747 --> 00:19:46,416
GO ON.
YOU'RE RUNNIN' LIKE A GIRL.

446
00:19:46,449 --> 00:19:47,750
RUN!

447
00:19:50,219 --> 00:19:51,754
[ BELL RINGING ]

448
00:19:57,961 --> 00:20:00,530
OH,
THE HUMANITY!

449
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,199
WE WERE SO CLOSE.
SO CLOSE.

450
00:20:03,266 --> 00:20:05,868
MIND YOU, WE'RE NOT
BLAMING ANYBODY.

451
00:20:05,935 --> 00:20:08,271
NO, IF GOD HAD MEANT
FOR MAN TO FLY,

452
00:20:08,338 --> 00:20:10,873
HE WOULD NEVER HAVE
GIVEN US SCHOOL BUSES.

453
00:20:12,141 --> 00:20:15,578
WE HAD 17 BARBECUES
HOOKED UP TO
THE FRAME.

454
00:20:15,611 --> 00:20:17,180
WE HAD THEM RUNNIN'
REAL GOOD,

455
00:20:17,246 --> 00:20:18,581
REALLY PUMPIN' THE
HEAT OUTTA THERE.

456
00:20:18,614 --> 00:20:20,683
AND AFTER THE FIRST HOUR,
WE HAD LIFT-OFF.

457
00:20:20,717 --> 00:20:23,986
YOU KNOW, IT WAS KINDA SPOOKY
WHEN WE CLEARED THE TREES.

458
00:20:24,053 --> 00:20:26,189
SCARED THE HECK OUTTA
OLD MAN SEDGWICK,
DIDN'T IT?

459
00:20:26,255 --> 00:20:27,690
SURE DID.

460
00:20:27,724 --> 00:20:30,660
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE BUZZED
OVER HIM, HE THOUGHT WE

462
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:37,633
YEAH,
THAT WAS AMAZING.

463
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:41,838
NOBODY'S BEEN UP THAT HIGH IN A
SCHOOL BUS SINCE THE '60s.

464
00:20:42,138 --> 00:20:44,674
WE HAD ALL THE HOT AIR
TRAPPED INSIDE THE BUS.

465
00:20:44,707 --> 00:20:46,375
IF WE WANTED TO
ADJUST THE HEIGHT,

466
00:20:46,442 --> 00:20:48,311
WE JUST TURNED UP
THE OLD BARBECUES.

467
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:50,413
BOY, WE COULD'VE FLOATED
LIKE THAT FOREVER,

BLAMING ANYBODY.

00:20:53,616 --> 00:20:54,917
OKAY, LOOK.

471
00:20:54,951 --> 00:20:56,986
I'M SORRY, OKAY.
I'M SORRY.

472
00:20:57,053 --> 00:20:58,754
IT WAS INSTINCT, YOU KNOW.

473
00:20:58,788 --> 00:21:00,723
I MEAN, I SAW THE RAILROAD
CROSSING COMING UP --

474
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,625
WE'RE IN A SCHOOL BUS.

475
00:21:02,658 --> 00:21:05,128
I JUST HIT THE BRAKES
AND OPENED THE DOOR.

476
00:21:07,296 --> 00:21:09,265
WE DROPPED
LIKE A STONE.

SAVE ME
A SEAT, MIKE.

482
00:21:19,942 --> 00:21:21,277
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

483
00:21:21,344 --> 00:21:22,612
I'LL BE COMING STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

484
00:21:22,678 --> 00:21:24,113
I THOUGHT WE COULD PLAY
A LITTLE GAME TONIGHT,

485
00:21:24,146 --> 00:21:27,516
I'LL SHOW YOU SOME BRUISES,
AND YOU GUESS HOW I GOT 'EM.

00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,819
AND TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHIN'.
