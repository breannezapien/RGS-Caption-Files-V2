1
00:00:01,901 --> 00:00:04,137
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

2
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:07,574
HERE'S THE MAN WHO LEFT
HIS BODY TO SCIENCE,

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,110
HIS WARDROBE TO HISTORY,
AND HIS PERSONALITY TO CHANCE,

4
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:13,446
YOUR HERO, MY UNCLE, RED GREEN!

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,181
(Applause)

6
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:18,384
HO HO HO! BY GOLLY!

7
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,920
ALL RIGHT! THANK YOU!

8
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:22,655
HEY, ALL RIGHT.

9
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:24,858
SAVE YOURSELVES --

10
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:25,692
YOU'VE GOT FAMILIES.

11
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:27,827
WELL, YOU KNOW,

12
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,562
EVERY YEAR THIS TIME,

13
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,730
THE GUYS START MAKIN'

14
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,398
THEIR OWN BEER AND WINE.

15
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:34,434
THEY'RE TRYIN' TO GIVE

16
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,902
SOMETHING BACK TO THE SYSTEM.

17
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,305
ONE FELLA MADE
AN INTERESTING BATCH.

18
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,174
DOESN'T TASTE TOO BAD.

19
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:42,642
IS IT WINE

20
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,178
OR BEER?
KINDA HARD
TO TELL.

21
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,780
IT'S EITHER A SPARKLING WINE

22
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:49,282
OR A LIGHT BEER.

23
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:51,751
WHAT DOES IT SAY ON THE LABEL?

24
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:54,387
UM, "AMERICAN STANDARD".

25
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:57,724
WELL, IT'S STILL
IN THE BATHTUB.

26
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,059
IT'S BREWIN' AWAY RIGHT NOW.

27
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:03,463
THAT'S MY SCIENCE EXPERIMENT
FROM THE SCIENCE FAIR!

28
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,398
YEAH, I'M PICKLING
POLLIWOGS.

29
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,967
COME ON, TASTES WAY TOO GOOD
FOR THAT.

30
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:11,004
BESIDES, WHY WOULD YOU PUT
ALL THOSE OLIVES IN THERE?

31
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,573
THOSE ARE
THE POLLIWOGS.

32
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,941
(Audience laughing)

33
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:20,079
(Horns honking)

34
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,148
(Geese honking)

35
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,653
(Quacking)

36
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:31,524
(Red): YOU'RE LOOKIN'
AT SEGMENTS

37
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,293
FROM THIS PARTICULAR SHOW,

38
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,961
THE MAIN MESSAGE BEING,

39
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,629
FOR GOSH SAKES,
DON'T EVEN THINK

40
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,731
ABOUT CHANGING THE CHANNEL.

41
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,334
TO MAKE SENSE OUT OF THIS
PROGRAMME,

42
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:44,003
YOU GOTTA GIVE IT
YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.

43
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:52,378
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS.

44
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,281
YOU DRANK MY SCIENCE EXPERIMENT
RIGHT OUT OF THE TUB.

45
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:59,085
MOOSE LICKED THE RING
AND ATE THE PLUG.

46
00:01:59,318 --> 00:02:00,319
RELAX, HAROLD.

47
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,388
YOU CAN MAKE
SOMETHING ELSE.

48
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,425
IT WAS THE WHOLE ECOLOGY
OF OUR WETLAND.

49
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:09,162
NOW I GOT 12 LODGE MEMBERS
IN A BELCHING CONTEST.

50
00:02:09,228 --> 00:02:11,164
WORK THAT INTO THE PROJECT.

51
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,532
THAT'S MARSH GAS.

52
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:14,467
I TELL YOU WHAT, HAROLD.

53
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,736
LET'S DO A PROJECT TOGETHER

54
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,071
ON TOXIC WASTE
OR THE OZONE LAYER.

55
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:20,573
WE COULD, BUT NO.

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,377
I HAD MY HEART SET ON WINNING
THIS CONTEST.

57
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:27,313
GIRLS LIKE GUYS
WHO LOOK LIKE SCIENTISTS.

58
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,148
YOU LOOK MORE
LIKE AN EXPERIMENT.

59
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,017
(Audience laughing)

60
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,585
I KNOW WHAT I CAN DO!

61
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:34,554
I KNOW WHAT I CAN DO!

62
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:37,056
I'LL DO, LIKE, ASTRONOMY.

63
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,158
I'LL GRIND MY OWN LENSES,
SILVER MY MIRRORS.

64
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:42,361
I'LL ALIGN THE FOCAL PLANES
AND MAKE A TELESCOPE.

65
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,464
THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN --
I'LL GET SOME DUCT TAPE.

66
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:47,200
NO, NO, NO!

67
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,435
ADULTS AREN'T ALLOWED TO HELP.

68
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,470
YOU EITHER.

69
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:55,208
ALL RIGHT, YOU GRIND YOUR
HUBBLE TO YOUR HEART'S CONTENT.

70
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:57,310
I'M GONNA MAKE
MY OWN TELESCOPE.

71
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:58,811
ALL RIGHTY.

72
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,980
I COULD BE A GREAT ASTRONOMER.

73
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,983
HE'S GOOD AT STARING
OFF INTO SPACE.

74
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,785
(Audience laughing)

75
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:07,820
(Red): ONE OF
THE BIGGEST DANGERS

76
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:09,855
OF HAVING SOMETHING
ON TELEVISION

77
00:03:09,922 --> 00:03:12,191
IS THAT PEOPLE SEE THINGS
AND TRY THEM,

78
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:13,559
LIKE BLOWIN' UP A VAN,

79
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:16,228
OR DOING SOMETHING ATHLETIC,
IN BILL'S CASE.

80
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:18,097
HE'S GONNA CHANGE HIS CLOTHES.

81
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,832
HE SAW THIS AT THE OLYMPICS,

82
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,001
WHERE THEY HAVE THE RINGS
AND YOU...

83
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,469
WHAT'S THAT?

84
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,005
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE
RIGHT... RIGHT...

85
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,340
OH! OH!

86
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:29,875
THEY DON'T NEED TO SEE THAT
AT HOME.

87
00:03:29,942 --> 00:03:33,512
THAT'S YOUR PERSONAL BUSINESS
UNDER THERE, I WOULD THINK.

88
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:35,414
NO, DON'T-- OH, IT'S A SHOE.

89
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,016
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S FINE.

90
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,018
THERE'S A BIT OF A PONG.

91
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,820
ANYWAY, NICE FIGURE.

92
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:43,155
FINE-LOOKIN' MAN,
AND UP HE GOES.

93
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:45,458
I TELL YA,
WHAT HE'S FINDING OUT

94
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:49,161
IS THAT SOME THINGS
AREN'T AS EASY AS THEY LOOK --

95
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:52,465
THINGS LIKE BEING
BILL'S FRIEND, FOR EXAMPLE.

96
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:54,967
I'LL GIVE YOU A BOOST UP.

97
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:58,471
I'M GIVING YOU--
IT'S A BOOST, BILL, A BOOST UP.

98
00:03:58,537 --> 00:03:59,972
OH, MAN!

99
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,607
WOW! OHHH...

100
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,976
WELCOME TO THE POSSUM LODGE
WORD GAME!

101
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,245
TONIGHT'S PRIZE IS
A WEEKEND FOR TWO

102
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,247
AT THE SOLITAIRE CHAMPIONSHIPS.

103
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,416
OK, UNCLE RED,
YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS

104
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,685
TO GET MIKE HAMAR
TO SAY THIS WORD.

105
00:04:14,186 --> 00:04:15,688
FATHER.

106
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:18,991
FATHER.

107
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,493
AND GO.

108
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:23,929
ALL RIGHT, MIKE,
YOUR MOTHER IS MARRIED TO...

109
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:27,366
UH, HER JOB --
EXOTIC DANCING'S HER LIFE.

110
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,636
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT THE MAN

111
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:32,004
WHO TOOK CARE OF YOU
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG

112
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,373
WAS YOUR...
TRUANT OFFICER.

113
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:37,843
OH, THIS IS
A FAMILY MEMBER, MIKE.

114
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,012
THE MAN WHO SLEPT
WITH YOUR MOTHER.

115
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,715
(Audience laughing)

116
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:43,782
COULD YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC?

117
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:45,384
(Audience laughing)

118
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:49,455
GROWING UP WITH JUST A MOM,
YOU KNEW YOU HAD A...

119
00:04:49,521 --> 00:04:51,490
CURFEW.

120
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:53,759
ANOTHER WORD FOR "DADDY".

121
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,761
LIFER.

122
00:04:57,062 --> 00:04:59,531
ALL RIGHT, MIKE,
IF YOUR WIFE HAS KIDS,

123
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:01,367
YOU'LL BE...
LONG GONE.

124
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:02,968
(Audience laughing)

125
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:04,470
OH, OH, OH, OH!

126
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:06,572
JUST LIKE YOUR...

127
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,574
FATHER.

128
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:12,144
(Applause and cheering)

129
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:16,115
THIS WEEK ON "HANDYMAN CORNER",
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE

130
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:18,317
A VERY COMMON JOINT
THAT YOU USE

131
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:21,720
FOR BUILDING FURNITURE,
HOUSES, EVEN WOODEN CARS.

132
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:23,355
IT'S A 90-DEGREE JOINT.

133
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:27,226
ALL'S YOU NEED IS A TABLE SAW,
OR A FRIEND WHO HAS ONE.

134
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:30,162
I'VE JUST SWITCHED
THE BLADE IN THIS,

135
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,598
BECAUSE THIS WAS
A SPECIAL BLADE

136
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,000
WHICH IS USED
FOR CUTTIN' METAL.

137
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:37,503
DOES A HECK OF A JOB,
DOESN'T IT?

138
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:40,506
(Crashing)

139
00:05:40,572 --> 00:05:44,076
YOU DON'T NEED TO HORSE
THIS THING DOWN OR ANYTHING.

140
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,944
JUST FINGER-TIGHT IS FINE.

141
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:47,446
(Squeaking)

142
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,014
THEN JUST START 'ER UP.

143
00:05:52,284 --> 00:05:54,753
I SHOULD HAVE USED
A STRONGER FINGER.

144
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,689
THERE'S A LESSON
TO YOU YOUNGSTERS.

145
00:05:57,756 --> 00:05:59,224
NEVER COMPROMISE SAFETY

146
00:05:59,224 --> 00:06:02,528
JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN'T FIND
THE WRENCH.

147
00:06:03,395 --> 00:06:05,464
OHHH!

148
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,466
OH!

149
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,035
I WONDER IF IT'S STILL SHARP.

150
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,906
YEAH.

151
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,174
(Grunting)

152
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:19,545
(Saw squeaking)

153
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:23,348
(Grunting)

154
00:06:23,415 --> 00:06:24,983
WE'RE READY TO START CUTTIN'.

155
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,985
(Coughing)

156
00:06:27,052 --> 00:06:30,489
HERE'S SOME ADVICE --
COUNT YOUR FINGERS

157
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:32,391
BEFORE AND AFTER EVERY CUT.

158
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,927
THEN YOU'LL KNOW IF YOU SHOULD
BE SIFTING THROUGH THE SAWDUST.

159
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:39,064
AND WE DO THIS CUT, HERE.

160
00:06:44,503 --> 00:06:47,839
AND, UH, JUST THAT EASY,
BASICALLY.

161
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,942
SHE'S, UH...

162
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:52,477
ALL RIGHT, SHE DIDN'T ACTUALLY
CUT ALL THE WAY THROUGH,

163
00:06:52,544 --> 00:06:55,948
SO WE'D HAVE TO SET THE BLADE
A LITTLE HIGHER

164
00:06:56,014 --> 00:06:58,350
OR YOU CAN SET THE TABLE LOWER.

165
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:59,952
YOUR CHOICE, REALLY.

166
00:07:00,018 --> 00:07:01,954
OH, NO, I KNOW.

167
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,089
(Audience laughing)

168
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:09,061
THAT OUGHT TO DO 'ER.

169
00:07:09,294 --> 00:07:11,630
HERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
YOU CAN DO.

170
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,632
WHEN YOU WANT TO CUT
ALONG THE LENGTH,

171
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:15,767
THAT'S CALLED "RIPPING".

172
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:17,703
YOU CAN RIP THROUGH THE BOARD.

173
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,538
IT'S EASIER
THAN DOING IT BY HAND.

174
00:07:19,538 --> 00:07:20,539
IT'S CALLED RIPPING.

175
00:07:26,178 --> 00:07:27,979
IT WENT RIPPIN' OUT OF THERE.

176
00:07:28,046 --> 00:07:29,481
(Laughing)

177
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:31,516
HERE'S WHAT I WANTED
TO SHOW YOU.

178
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:36,121
WHEN YOU JOIN PIECES OF WOOD
IN A 90-DEGREE ANGLE,

179
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:38,023
SOMETIMES YOU MAKE
A JOINT LIKE THAT.

180
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:39,891
THAT'S CALLED A BUTT JOINT.

181
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:41,893
FRANKLY, IT'S KIND OF
BUTT-UGLY.

182
00:07:41,893 --> 00:07:43,695
I'LL SHOW YOU
HOW TO MAKE ANOTHER KIND

183
00:07:43,762 --> 00:07:45,130
CALLED A MITRE JOINT.

184
00:07:45,197 --> 00:07:48,767
"MITRE" -- THAT'S A FRENCH WORD
THAT MEANS "NOT BUTT".

185
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:50,168
OK?

186
00:07:50,235 --> 00:07:52,737
YOU'LL STILL HAVE
YOUR 90-DEGREE ANGLE,

187
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:54,840
BUT YOU'LL DO IT WITH TWO 45's.

188
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:55,974
YOU WANT TO HAVE A RIGHT ANGLE.

189
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:59,678
ANYTHING ELSE IS A WRONG ANGLE,
WHICH I HAVE PROVEN MANY TIMES.

190
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:03,515
SET YOUR SAW TO EXACTLY
45 DEGREES.

191
00:08:13,725 --> 00:08:16,294
THERE WE GO.

192
00:08:16,294 --> 00:08:17,262
ALL RIGHT, SO, UH...

193
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:20,765
NOW WE GOT
OUR TWO 45-DEGREE ANGLES.

194
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:22,701
WE PUT THOSE TOGETHER.

195
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:24,903
PUT THAT ONE THERE
AND WHAT YOU'RE GONNA FIND

196
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,705
WHEN THIS GOES TOGETHER
EXACTLY RIGHT IS

197
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:29,407
YOU'VE GOT A PERFECT
90-DEGREE ANGLE.

198
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:31,977
(Audience laughing)

199
00:08:32,043 --> 00:08:34,479
YEAH, UM...

200
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:35,981
(Crashing)

201
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:37,482
WE HAVEN'T GOT THE ANGLE

202
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:40,552
JUST ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ON THIS.

203
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:45,423
WE'LL GET 'ER.

204
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,926
BY GOLLY, SHE'S SENSITIVE.

205
00:08:52,497 --> 00:08:55,333
I MAY HAVE OVER-COMPENSATED
A BIT, THERE,

206
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,670
AND I'M RUNNIN' OUT OF WOOD
SO I GOTTA THINK--

207
00:08:58,737 --> 00:09:01,439
YOU KNOW, I NEED A TOTAL
OF 90 DEGREES

208
00:09:01,506 --> 00:09:03,942
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
TWO 45's.

209
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:04,943
I'VE GOT A...

210
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,544
THAT'S ABOUT A 72 THERE,

211
00:09:06,611 --> 00:09:09,014
SO WHAT I NEED TO MAKE 90
WOULD BE...

212
00:09:11,016 --> 00:09:13,818
... SEVENTEEN, OR SOMEWHERE
IN THAT AREA.

213
00:09:13,885 --> 00:09:15,186
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS

214
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:18,390
HAVE THE TABLE SAW
JACKED FORWARD 90 DEGREES.

215
00:09:18,456 --> 00:09:21,459
A TABLE SAW'S
A HECK OF A THING.

216
00:09:21,526 --> 00:09:23,028
I MEAN, THEY'RE FASTER.

217
00:09:23,094 --> 00:09:26,631
THEY'RE MORE ACCURATE
THAN WHAT YOU CAN CUT YOURSELF.

218
00:09:26,698 --> 00:09:29,968
THEY DON'T COST THAT MUCH
FOR WHAT YOU GET...

219
00:09:33,338 --> 00:09:34,406
... AND THEY'RE PORTABLE.

220
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,841
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

221
00:09:36,908 --> 00:09:38,977
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

222
00:09:39,043 --> 00:09:41,346
BUSTER, I'M DONE
WITH YOUR TABLE SAW.

223
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:42,914
HERE IT COMES!

224
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:47,051
STAY TUNED -- WHATEVER THIS IS,
WE GOT LOTS MORE OF IT.

225
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:51,890
NEED TO TALK TO YOU LADIES

226
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:55,426
TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND
WHY WE MEN DO WHAT WE DO.

227
00:09:56,494 --> 00:09:59,164
FOR EXAMPLE, NOT STOPPING
TO ASK FOR DIRECTIONS

228
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,498
WHEN WE'RE LOST.

229
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,635
OK, PRIMARILY,
IT'S A PRIDE THING.

230
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:04,802
WE'RE OUT THERE.

231
00:10:04,802 --> 00:10:07,906
WE'RE DRIVING AROUND IN
OUR OWN VEHICLES, BURNING GAS.

232
00:10:07,972 --> 00:10:11,176
GOT THE SUNGLASSES ON,
LOOKIN' GOOD, YOU KNOW?

233
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:13,111
PEOPLE SEE US GOIN' BY
WOULD NEVER GUESS

234
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:15,180
THAT WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE WE ARE.

235
00:10:16,481 --> 00:10:20,418
AND WE'RE NOT REAL EXCITED
ABOUT SHARING THAT INFORMATION.

236
00:10:20,485 --> 00:10:22,720
A MAN DOES NOT EMBRACE
THE CONCEPT

237
00:10:22,787 --> 00:10:24,789
OF GOING UP TO TOTAL STRANGERS
AND SAYING,

238
00:10:25,023 --> 00:10:27,292
"YOU MAY NOT KNOW THIS,
BUT I'M A MORON."

239
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:30,862
WHEREAS THE WOMAN
THAT HE'S WITH

240
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:34,666
IS ONLY TOO HAPPY
TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION.

241
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:37,602
I THINK IT HELPS TO EASE
HER BURDEN A LITTLE BIT.

242
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:40,605
TO A WOMAN, GETTIN' LOST
WHEN YOU'RE ON A TRIP

243
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:43,207
IS JUST A BLAMELESS
ACT OF NATURE,

244
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:46,144
BUT TO A MAN, IT'S A SIGN
OF PERSONAL FAILURE.

245
00:10:47,412 --> 00:10:49,113
HE KNEW WHERE HE WAS
WHEN HE LEFT.

246
00:10:49,113 --> 00:10:50,648
HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHERE HE IS NOW.

247
00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:53,818
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY,
HE CROSSED THE LINE

248
00:10:53,818 --> 00:10:56,888
BETWEEN THE WORLD HE KNOWS
AND THE WORLD HE DOESN'T KNOW.

249
00:10:57,455 --> 00:10:59,991
THAT'S HOW HE FEELS
ABOUT WHEN HE GOT MARRIED...

250
00:10:59,991 --> 00:11:02,393
(Audience laughing)

251
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,396
... AND WHEN HE HAD KIDS.

252
00:11:05,997 --> 00:11:07,632
SO IF HE ADMITS HE'S LOST
IN HIS CAR,

253
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:08,700
HE'S GONNA HAVE TO ADMIT

254
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,536
HE'S LOST IN THOSE OTHER AREAS
AS WELL.

255
00:11:11,602 --> 00:11:13,204
THAT'S WAY TOO MUCH TO ASK.

256
00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:15,406
SO JUST SIT THERE,
BITE YOUR TONGUE,

257
00:11:15,473 --> 00:11:17,241
CIRCLE THE BLOCK A FEW TIMES.

258
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:19,143
MEN AREN'T LOST.

259
00:11:19,143 --> 00:11:20,912
THEY JUST TAKE THE LONG WAY.

260
00:11:20,978 --> 00:11:23,014
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

261
00:11:23,081 --> 00:11:24,849
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

262
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:29,487
(Applause and cheering)

263
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:34,192
WELL, HAROLD, THINK YOU'RE
GONNA WIN FIRST PRIZE

264
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:35,326
AT THE SCHOOL SCIENCE FAIR.

265
00:11:35,393 --> 00:11:38,563
I'M GONNA HOOK THIS
TO THE THING.

266
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:40,064
YOU CAN'T LOSE WITH THIS.

267
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:42,667
HUH?

268
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:44,469
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

269
00:11:44,469 --> 00:11:46,137
FROM AN ELEPHANT'S
PROCTOLOGIST?

270
00:11:47,405 --> 00:11:49,273
HAROLD, I MADE THIS.

271
00:11:49,273 --> 00:11:50,808
THIS IS YOUR TELESCOPE.

272
00:11:50,808 --> 00:11:52,076
I HELPED YOU A LITTLE BIT.

273
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:54,345
LIKE,
I DID THE BUILDING PART BIT.

274
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:55,813
BUT IT WAS YOUR IDEA --

275
00:11:55,813 --> 00:11:58,916
WELL, IT WAS GALILEO'S IDEA,
BUT HE'S DEAD.

276
00:11:58,983 --> 00:12:00,418
YOU CAN'T HELP ME.

277
00:12:00,484 --> 00:12:02,119
IT'S AGAINST SCIENCE FAIR RULES.

278
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:04,088
BESIDES, I WANT TO WIN.

279
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:05,590
HAROLD, YOU'LL WIN.

280
00:12:05,656 --> 00:12:07,091
LOOK IN THE MIRROR.

281
00:12:07,158 --> 00:12:09,427
THAT'S OUT OF A FORD GALAXY.

282
00:12:09,493 --> 00:12:10,862
THAT'S OUT OF A COMET.

283
00:12:10,862 --> 00:12:13,965
THE ONE INSIDE'S
OUT OF A SATURN.

284
00:12:14,031 --> 00:12:15,466
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

285
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:17,668
OH, THAT'S AMAZING.

286
00:12:17,668 --> 00:12:19,604
WHAT DOES IT SAY THERE?

287
00:12:19,604 --> 00:12:23,040
"CAUTION: UNIVERSES MAY SEEM
CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR."

288
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:25,409
NO, YOU CAN'T HELP.

289
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:26,677
I'M DOING IT BY MYSELF.

290
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:29,747
MY DAD HELPED ME WITH HOMEWORK.

291
00:12:29,814 --> 00:12:31,782
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU GUYS
WERE IN THE SAME GRADE.

292
00:12:31,849 --> 00:12:34,952
(Laughing)

293
00:12:34,952 --> 00:12:38,155
I'M NOT DOING
A TELESCOPE ANY MORE.

294
00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:39,557
I'M DOING A CRYSTAL RADIO SET.

295
00:12:39,557 --> 00:12:41,058
I'VE JUST GOT
A LITTLE MORE SOLDERING TO DO.

296
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,560
OH, OH, OH!

297
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:44,061
SEE, SEE, SEE.

298
00:12:44,128 --> 00:12:45,563
I'LL GET IT -- OOO!

299
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,064
SEE, SEE, SEE.

300
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:48,566
YOU GET THAT.

301
00:12:48,632 --> 00:12:50,134
NO, YOU GET IT.

302
00:12:50,201 --> 00:12:53,571
OH, IF YOU SEE
A BIG FAT DOG

303
00:12:53,637 --> 00:12:55,206
WADDLING DOWN THE ROAD

304
00:12:55,272 --> 00:12:58,209
DON'T YOU BE TOO CRITICAL
OF HIS EXTRA WIDE LOAD

305
00:12:58,275 --> 00:13:00,211
IF YOU'VE EVER TASTED
DOG FOOD

306
00:13:00,277 --> 00:13:01,812
YOU'VE GOT TO
TIP YOUR HAT

307
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:03,481
TO AN ANIMAL WHO COULD
ACTUALLY OVEREAT

308
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:06,917
ON A DIET OF CRAP
LIKE THAT

309
00:13:11,989 --> 00:13:15,593
MY NAME IS DALTON HUMPHREY,
AND I'M A MAN.

310
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:18,095
(All): HI, DALTON.

311
00:13:18,162 --> 00:13:22,099
AND, UH, IT'S BEEN TWO WEEKS
SINCE I LAST ACTED LIKE A GUY.

312
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,168
AND THIS WEEK, UH...

313
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:29,540
THIS WEEK I DID SOMETHING
I'M PRETTY PROUD OF.

314
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,175
IT'S A FIRST FOR ME.

315
00:13:31,242 --> 00:13:32,676
I DID LAUNDRY.

316
00:13:32,743 --> 00:13:35,546
WHOA!

317
00:13:35,613 --> 00:13:37,114
WOW!

318
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:40,284
WASHIN', DRYIN',
THE WHOLE NINE YARDS.

319
00:13:40,351 --> 00:13:42,953
YOU KNOW, WHAT I REALIZED
IS THAT

320
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,056
THE PROBLEM WAS IN MY HEAD,
YOU KNOW.

321
00:13:46,123 --> 00:13:47,725
IT WAS MY ATTITUDE.

322
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:51,061
IF YOU-- IF YOU--
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR ATTITUDE,

323
00:13:51,128 --> 00:13:53,397
YOU CAN CHANGE THE WHOLE WORLD.

324
00:13:53,464 --> 00:13:58,102
SO I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT
AS IF IT WAS WASHING CLOTHES.

325
00:13:58,168 --> 00:14:02,239
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT LIKE IT WAS
RESTORING CLOTHES.

326
00:14:02,306 --> 00:14:03,741
SEE.

327
00:14:03,807 --> 00:14:05,743
REFINISHING A SHIRT.

328
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:08,679
RENOVATING A PAIR OF PANTS.

329
00:14:08,746 --> 00:14:11,148
AND IT WASN'T A CHORE.

330
00:14:11,215 --> 00:14:14,051
THIS WAS A PROJECT, YOU KNOW.

331
00:14:14,118 --> 00:14:18,689
AND I DIDN'T EVEN CALL IT
A WASHER AND A DRYER,

332
00:14:18,756 --> 00:14:21,225
BECAUSE THESE ARE MY TOOLS.

333
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:25,296
THESE ARE MY POWER TOOLS,
MY BIG POWER TOOLS.

334
00:14:25,362 --> 00:14:27,865
SO I CALLED THEM
A DIRT STRIPPER,

335
00:14:27,931 --> 00:14:29,700
AND A HEAT TURBINE.

336
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:31,201
"STAND BACK, KIDS!

337
00:14:31,268 --> 00:14:33,437
"DAD'S USING THE HEAT TURBINE!"

338
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:36,573
YOU KNOW WHAT?

339
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,375
THERE IS NO RULE THAT SAYS

340
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:40,944
A WASHER AND A DRYER
HAVE TO BE WHITE.

341
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:44,715
WHY DON'T THEY MAKE 'EM BLACK
OR BROWN, LIKE A RADIAL ARM SAW

342
00:14:44,782 --> 00:14:46,884
OR A JOINTER,
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE?

343
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,687
YOU KNOW WHAT THE UP-SIDE
OF ALL THIS IS?

344
00:14:49,753 --> 00:14:53,290
MY WIFE WAS THRILLED.

345
00:14:55,092 --> 00:14:59,063
TWO LOADS OF LAUNDRY,
SHE'S HAPPY, SHE'S...

346
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:00,597
SHE WAS FRIENDLY.

347
00:15:00,664 --> 00:15:03,734
WOW!

348
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:05,235
THAT'S RIGHT.

349
00:15:05,302 --> 00:15:06,870
AND I'M GONNA SURPRISE HER.

350
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,539
I'M SURPRISING HER RIGHT NOW,

351
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:12,409
BY WASHING
ALL HER WOOLLEN SWEATERS.

352
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:17,347
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
THE LOOK ON HER FACE

353
00:15:17,347 --> 00:15:20,551
WHEN I PULL THOSE BABIES
OUT OF THE DRYER.

354
00:15:20,617 --> 00:15:24,254
THAT'S GONNA BE SOMETHING.

355
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:28,525
THANK YOU.

356
00:15:28,592 --> 00:15:30,027
(Red): HERE WE ARE

357
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:32,529
BACK WITH
"ADVENTURES WITH BILL".

358
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,631
HE'S READY TO GO.

359
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:35,532
HE'S GOT THE CHALK.

360
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:37,401
IT'S NOT CHALK --
IT'S FLOUR.

361
00:15:37,467 --> 00:15:39,703
YOU DON'T NEED
A LOT OF THAT, BILL.

362
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,272
FOR INSTANCE,
YOU DON'T NEED THAT MUCH.

363
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:45,475
ANYWAY, I'M NOT GONNA TRY
AND BOOST HIM UP AGAIN.

364
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:48,245
HE'S GOING TO GO UP THERE
ON THE OIL DRUM.

365
00:15:48,312 --> 00:15:51,815
THIS IS GOING TO TAKE
A LOT OF... A LOT OF STRENGTH.

366
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,885
WOW.

367
00:15:54,952 --> 00:15:57,588
BOY, OH, BOY,
I'M IMPRESSED WITH THAT.

368
00:15:57,654 --> 00:16:02,392
SOMETIMES I THINK BILL'S
AN IDIOT AND CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

369
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:05,495
THEN I REALIZE I'M WRONG --
HE'S JUST AN IDIOT.

370
00:16:05,562 --> 00:16:07,231
THERE HE IS, UPSIDE DOWN.

371
00:16:07,297 --> 00:16:09,399
LOOK AT THE POWER THERE, FOLKS.

372
00:16:09,466 --> 00:16:13,570
YOU DON'T SEE THAT EVERY DAY,
AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING,

373
00:16:13,637 --> 00:16:15,572
ESPECIALLY AROUND MEAL-TIME.

374
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:17,240
(Groaning)

375
00:16:17,307 --> 00:16:19,643
WHAT ARE THOSE NOISES?

376
00:16:19,643 --> 00:16:23,013
I THINK BILL'S BACK
ISN'T WHAT IT USED...

377
00:16:23,013 --> 00:16:24,915
KIND OF EGYPTIAN,
KIND OF AN UPSIDE DOWN--

378
00:16:24,982 --> 00:16:27,784
OH, BOY, I'M GETTING A DISPLAY

379
00:16:27,784 --> 00:16:28,785
AND SO ARE YOU.

380
00:16:28,852 --> 00:16:30,687
WHAT NOW, BILL?

381
00:16:30,754 --> 00:16:32,189
OH, MY GOSH!

382
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,524
LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE BOY.

383
00:16:34,591 --> 00:16:36,026
WHAT, THE OTHER ARM?

384
00:16:36,093 --> 00:16:37,694
MY GOSH, HE'S AMBIRINGSTROUS.

385
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:41,198
THAT'S GOT TO BE HARD
ON THE ARM, ISN'T IT, BILL?

386
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:44,668
UH-OH -- NOW BILL
LEARNS ABOUT GRAVITY.

387
00:16:45,435 --> 00:16:46,870
OH!

388
00:16:46,937 --> 00:16:48,705
MY GOSH.

389
00:16:48,772 --> 00:16:51,708
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
I GIVE YOU...

390
00:16:51,775 --> 00:16:54,845
THE LORD OF THE RINGS.

391
00:16:54,911 --> 00:16:59,116
HERE'S A "RED GREEN" SIGN
SENT TO US BY A VIEWER.

392
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,988
GOOD NEWS, HAROLD.

393
00:17:05,055 --> 00:17:07,657
THIS CRYSTAL RADIO'S
GONNA WIN YOU FIRST PRIZE.

394
00:17:07,724 --> 00:17:09,359
CONGRATULATIONS
AND GOOD WORK.

395
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:11,595
GOOD WORK? --
YOU BUILT THE THING.

396
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:14,397
DON'T, DON'T, DON'T --
DON'T TOUCH IT.

397
00:17:14,464 --> 00:17:16,633
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS.

398
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,836
WHEN WE GET TO SCHOOL
I'LL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

399
00:17:19,903 --> 00:17:22,472
I CANNOT ENTER SOMETHING

400
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:24,508
THAT YOU BUILT,
OR HAVE YOU NOT BEEN LISTENING

401
00:17:24,508 --> 00:17:26,810
THE FIRST NINE TIMES
I SAID THAT?

402
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:29,045
I'M GONNA DO MY OWN PROJECT.

403
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:33,917
IT'S ABOUT SEX.

404
00:17:33,984 --> 00:17:35,418
AWW.

405
00:17:35,485 --> 00:17:37,988
OH, HAROLD, HAROLD -- SEX.

406
00:17:37,988 --> 00:17:39,089
I CAN'T HELP YOU THERE.

407
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:39,823
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

408
00:17:39,823 --> 00:17:42,325
OF COURSE, YOU'RE USED TO THAT,
AREN'T YA?

409
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:44,427
RIGHT?

410
00:17:44,494 --> 00:17:47,497
I'M GONNA DO
A FRANK AND EXPLICIT LOOK

411
00:17:47,497 --> 00:17:49,399
AT THE GERMINATION
OF SOYA BEANS,

412
00:17:49,466 --> 00:17:51,735
WITHOUT THE MEDDLING
OF AN ADULT.

413
00:17:51,801 --> 00:17:54,938
OK, BUT BUSTER HADFIELD
IS HELPING HIS SON

414
00:17:54,938 --> 00:17:57,707
MAKE AN ATOM-SMASHING
NUCLEAR ACCELERATOR CYCLOTRON

415
00:17:57,707 --> 00:17:59,809
OUT OF A T.V.
AND A WEED-WHACKER.

416
00:18:01,511 --> 00:18:04,214
I DON'T CARE --
I'M GONNA DO THINGS MY WAY.

417
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:06,716
I'M GONNA ENTER
THIS CRYSTAL RADIO

418
00:18:06,716 --> 00:18:08,518
IN THE SCIENCE FAIR MYSELF.

419
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:11,921
THE FAIR IS ONLY OPEN
TO HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS.

420
00:18:12,422 --> 00:18:13,623
I NEVER GRADUATED.

421
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,662
IT'S TIME TO FEATURE
THOSE THREE LITTLE WORDS

422
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:20,630
THAT MEN FIND SO HARD TO SAY.

423
00:18:20,697 --> 00:18:23,633
(All): I DON'T KNOW!

424
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:24,934
OK!

425
00:18:24,934 --> 00:18:27,504
TO JOIN MY UNCLE RED

426
00:18:27,504 --> 00:18:29,973
IS HIS BEST FRIEND
IN THE WHOLE WIDE ROOM,

427
00:18:30,106 --> 00:18:31,908
MR. HAP SHAUGHNESSY!

428
00:18:31,975 --> 00:18:36,813
(Applause and cheering)

429
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,314
OK.

430
00:18:38,381 --> 00:18:39,816
"DEAR EXPERTS,

431
00:18:39,883 --> 00:18:44,154
"IS IT TRUE THAT BASKETBALL
WAS INVENTED BY A CANADIAN?"

432
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,689
BASKETBALL WAS INVENTED
BY A CANADIAN,

433
00:18:46,756 --> 00:18:49,359
BUT HE WAS LIVING IN
THE UNITED STATES.

434
00:18:49,426 --> 00:18:52,095
OH, YEAH, YEAH,
I WAS IN THE STATES

435
00:18:52,162 --> 00:18:54,731
AT THE TIME,
BUT I DIDN'T GIVE UP

436
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:56,266
MY CANADIAN CITIZENSHIP.

437
00:18:56,332 --> 00:19:00,937
I WAS DOWN THERE DOING SOME
HUSH-HUSH WORK FOR THE C.I.A.,

438
00:19:01,004 --> 00:19:03,506
AS WAS THEN KNOWN AS
TEDDY'S ROUGHRIDERS.

439
00:19:04,774 --> 00:19:05,775
THEY WANTED ME TO COME UP WITH

440
00:19:05,842 --> 00:19:08,445
SOME COVER STORY
AS TO WHAT I DID FOR A LIVING.

441
00:19:08,511 --> 00:19:10,313
I SAID "SPORTS INVENTOR".

442
00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:16,085
AND TO MAKE THE COVER

443
00:19:16,085 --> 00:19:19,722
A BIT MORE CONVINCING,
OF COURSE, WOULDN'T YOU KNOW,

444
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:22,759
I HAD TO INVENT A SPORT.

445
00:19:24,594 --> 00:19:29,132
I SURE DIDN'T EXPECT
THAT DARN GAME TO CATCH ON.

446
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:31,301
HAP, YOU DON'T EXPECT US
TO BELIEVE THAT, DO YA?

447
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:33,503
WELL...

448
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,973
(Laughing)

449
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,808
YOU GOT ME THERE, RED!

450
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,310
NO, NO, NO, NO.

451
00:19:40,376 --> 00:19:41,811
THAT WASN'T TRUE.

452
00:19:41,878 --> 00:19:45,682
I SURE DID EXPECT
THAT DARN GAME TO CATCH ON.

453
00:19:47,617 --> 00:19:50,954
MR. SHAUGHNESSY, OUT OF ALL
THE HISTORY BOOKS I'VE READ,

454
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:54,090
THEY SAY THE CANADIAN WAS
MR. JAMES NAISMITH.

455
00:19:54,157 --> 00:19:55,592
JAMES NAISMITH, YEAH.

456
00:19:55,658 --> 00:19:57,794
THAT WAS MY C.I.A. COVER NAME.

457
00:19:59,262 --> 00:20:00,863
FUNNY YOU NEVER MENTIONED THAT,
HAP.

458
00:20:00,863 --> 00:20:02,966
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU
TO HOLD BACK.

459
00:20:03,032 --> 00:20:05,802
ALL MY SPY WORK
WAS TOP SECRET, YOU KNOW.

460
00:20:05,868 --> 00:20:07,637
THE ONLY REASON
I CAN MENTION THIS NOW

461
00:20:07,637 --> 00:20:10,373
IS BECAUSE FRANCO IS DEAD,

462
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,978
AND SPAIN IS NO LONGER
A THREAT TO WORLD PEACE.

463
00:20:15,044 --> 00:20:17,447
I'M FINDING THIS
HARD TO BELIEVE.

464
00:20:17,513 --> 00:20:19,148
THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE LISTENING.

465
00:20:20,483 --> 00:20:22,819
I'M TELLING YOU,
I INVENTED BASKETBALL.

466
00:20:22,885 --> 00:20:25,154
OH YEAH, OH, YEAH --
HOOP DREAMS.

467
00:20:26,322 --> 00:20:29,258
NO, NO, NO,
MAYBE HAP'S RIGHT.

468
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:31,461
REMEMBER THAT TIME HE WAS UP
ON THE DRUNK AND DISORDERLY,

469
00:20:31,527 --> 00:20:33,863
DRIBBLING ALL OVER THE COURT?

470
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:43,840
(Audience laughing)

471
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:50,546
(Applause)

472
00:20:53,783 --> 00:20:58,488
THE SCIENCE FAIR WAS, UH,
WAS FUN.

473
00:20:58,554 --> 00:21:01,691
WHOSE PROJECT EXPLODED THERE,
HAROLD?

474
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,760
I CAN'T HEAR YOU
OVER THE RINGING!

475
00:21:04,827 --> 00:21:08,431
I'M SAYING
WHOSE PROJECT EXPLODED?

476
00:21:08,965 --> 00:21:10,500
YOU MEAN THE FIRST TIME?

477
00:21:10,566 --> 00:21:12,001
YEAH, YEAH.

478
00:21:12,068 --> 00:21:13,936
THE ONE BESIDE US.

479
00:21:14,003 --> 00:21:16,439
(Both) THIS SIDE.

480
00:21:16,506 --> 00:21:17,940
YEAH, YEAH.

481
00:21:19,242 --> 00:21:21,043
SORRY YOU DIDN'T WIN, HAROLD.

482
00:21:21,043 --> 00:21:22,311
WELL, THAT'S OK.

483
00:21:22,311 --> 00:21:23,513
I ESCAPED WITH MY LIFE.

484
00:21:23,513 --> 00:21:25,481
THAT'S THE MAIN THING.

485
00:21:25,548 --> 00:21:27,450
WHO WON THE FIRST PRIZE ANYWAY?

486
00:21:27,516 --> 00:21:29,652
STINKY PETERSON HAS THE TROPHY.

487
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:33,089
THE DOCTORS SAY THEY CAN
GET THAT REMOVED THOUGH.

488
00:21:33,155 --> 00:21:36,092
THE ACTUAL WINNER WAS
ANDREA McCLINTOCK.

489
00:21:36,525 --> 00:21:38,961
THE JUDGES SAID HER ENTRY
OF FIRE EXTINGUISHERS

490
00:21:38,961 --> 00:21:41,230
WAS RATHER TIMELY.

491
00:21:41,297 --> 00:21:43,399
BUT, HAROLD,
I HEARD YOUR PROJECT

492
00:21:43,466 --> 00:21:46,369
MADE IT TO THE FINALS
OVER IN PORT ASBESTOS.

493
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:47,870
NO!

494
00:21:47,937 --> 00:21:50,473
THAT'S JUST WHERE
MOST OF THE PIECES LANDED.

495
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,475
(Squealing)

496
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:53,676
I DON'T HEAR IT,

497
00:21:53,676 --> 00:21:57,013
BUT IT'S GOT TO BE TIME
FOR THE LODGE MEETING.

498
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:59,615
IT'S PROBABLY TIME
FOR THE LODGE MEETIN'.

499
00:21:59,682 --> 00:22:01,984
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD?

500
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:04,787
LODGE

501
00:22:04,854 --> 00:22:06,288

502
00:22:06,355 --> 00:22:07,923
MAYBE JUST SOME FRIES.

503
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:10,693
WHY DON'T YOU GO
TO THE LODGE MEETIN'?

504
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,262
I'M JUST GONNA GO

505
00:22:13,329 --> 00:22:15,931

508
00:22:21,837 --> 00:22:25,408
OH, UNCLE RED.

509
00:22:26,142 --> 00:22:30,212
NOW, IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,
I LEARNED TODAY

510
00:22:30,212 --> 00:22:32,948
THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS
THAT MAN SHOULD NOT KNOW.

511
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,385
I'M HOPIN'
YOU'RE NOT ONE OF 'EM.

512
00:22:36,385 --> 00:22:38,788
I'LL BE COMING HOME
AFTER THE MEETING,

513
00:22:38,788 --> 00:22:41,123
AS SOON AS THE SMOULDERING
GOES DOWN IN MY PANTS.

514
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:44,126
TO THE REST OF YOU
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND --

515
00:22:44,193 --> 00:22:47,463
I GUESS HE'S GONE TO

KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

518
00:22:52,535 --> 00:22:56,472
(Applause and cheering)

00:22:56,539 --> 00:22:58,808

522
00:23:08,984 --> 00:23:10,853
OK, SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN.
