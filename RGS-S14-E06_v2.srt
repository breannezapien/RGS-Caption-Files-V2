1
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:05,638
EVER NOTICE HOW MOST
DOGS DON'T UNDERSTAND

2
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:08,007
THE CONCEPT "FULL"?

3
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:09,909
THEY JUST KEEP EATIN'
UNTIL THEY FINISH

4
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:11,945
WHATEVER IT IS
YOU PUT IN FRONT OF THEM.

5
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:14,681
THAT'S BECAUSE THE AVERAGE
CANINE IN DOG YEARS

6
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,816
IS ABOUT THE SAME AGE
AS A MIDDLE AGED MAN --

7
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:20,253
OR AS WE CALL THEM:
THE BUFFET YEARS.

8

COME ON, FELLA.

9
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:23,490
THE QUESTION IS,
WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,492
IF YOU COULD PUT OUT A WHOLE
WEEK'S WORTH OF DOG FOOD

11
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:28,394
WITHOUT HAVING TO REFILL
THE BOWL EVERY DAY?

12
00:00:28,394 --> 00:00:30,730
THE ANSWER'S OBVIOUS.

13
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,100
GET YOURSELF AN OLD CAR
WITH A RETRACTABLE SUNROOF.

14
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,703
YOU CAN PICK THESE UP PRETTY
CHEAP FROM A MIDDLE AGED
BALD GUY

15
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,739
WITH A SUNBURN
WHERE HIS HAIR USED TO BE.

16
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,474
ALL YOU NEED IS THE ROOF.

17
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:44,043
THE REST YOU CAN
SELL AS A CONVERTIBLE,

18
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:46,212
MAYBE TO THE
BALD GUY'S WIFE.

19
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,948
SHE'S PROBABLY
LOOKIN' TO TRADE UP.

20
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,320
JUST DISH OUT A
WEEK'S WORTH OF DOG FOOD

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,658
INTO THAT GIANT SALAD BOWL YOU
GOT AS A WEDDING PRESENT
AND NEVER USED.

22
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:02,862
ONCE ROVER'S DONE WITH IT,
YOU NEVER WILL.

23
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:06,566
JUST SLIDE THE DISH
UNDER THE SUNROOF

24
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,869
SO THE DOG CAN'T GET AT
THE FOOD UNLESS THE
UNIT IS OPEN.

25
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,305
AND SURE, YEAH, I COULD
OPEN THE SUNROOF MANUALLY,

26
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,007
BUT I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

27
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:18,811
I'VE HOOKED UP THE ON/OFF
MECHANISM TO THIS SOLAR
POWERED CALCULATOR.

00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:21,214
OH SURE, THE SOLAR PANEL'S
PRETTY SMALL ON THIS UNIT,

29
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:22,949
BUT THAT'S OKAY,

30
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:24,550
BECAUSE ONCE I PLACE HER
IN THIS WINDOW SILL,

SHE'S ONLY GONNA
CATCH THE SUN FROM, SAY,

I GUESS THAT'S ME.

156
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:43,595
YOU WANNA GET AN EVEN
DISTRIBUTION OF WATER

157
00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:45,130
THROUGHOUT THE WASH CYCLE,

158
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:50,102
SO COVER THE INTERIOR WITH AS
MANY OF THESE LAWN SPRINKLERS
AS YOU CAN FIND.

159
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:52,404
MY NEIGHBOURS ALL WATER
THEIR LAWNS AT NIGHT,

160
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:55,607
SO GETTING THESE SPRINKLERS
IS PRETTY EASY.

161
00:07:55,607 --> 00:07:57,776
THAT'S NOT FUNNY, HAROLD!

162
00:07:59,678 --> 00:08:01,613
NOW, THIS VEHICLE
HAS A SUNROOF.

163
00:08:01,613 --> 00:08:05,016
SO SHE MAKES AN EXCELLENT
TOP LOADING MODEL.

164
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:06,852
JUST JAM ALL YOUR
CLOTHES IN HERE.

165
00:08:06,852 --> 00:08:08,653
DON'T WORRY ABOUT
OVERLOADING THE MACHINE.

166
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:12,224
YOU KNOW, I ONCE SAW
15 CLOWNS GET OUT OF
A VEHICLE THIS SIZE.

167
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:14,893
SADLY, 16 HAD GOTTEN IN.

168
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:17,662
BUT THEY DEDICATED
THE WORLD RECORD TO HIM.

169
00:08:17,662 --> 00:08:20,832
WHY DO CLOWN STORIES
ALWAYS INVOLVE DEATH?

170
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:25,503
OKAY, SOCK THE LAUNDRY
DETERGENT IN THERE.

171
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:29,608
HEY, THESE THINGS REALLY DO
LET THE 'SUNLIGHT' IN.

172
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:34,613
REMEMBER THE FAB FOUR?

173
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:37,082
WELL, THIS IS
WHAT THE FAB'S FOR.

174
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:42,654
OH, TIDE'S COMIN' IN.

175
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:51,696
IN FACT, I'LL JUST --

176
00:08:51,696 --> 00:08:54,099
ALL RIGHT, HAROLD.
ALL RIGHT!

177
00:08:57,302 --> 00:09:00,372
OKAY, WE GOT OUR
SPRINKLERS RUNNIN' THERE,

178
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:02,307
AND I HOOKED THE HATCHBACK
UP TO THE POSSUM VAN

179
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:04,075
WITH A TOW BAR.

180
00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:06,945
THEN I STUCK A CONCRETE BLOCK
BEHIND THE REAR WHEEL.

181
00:09:06,945 --> 00:09:09,681
THAT'LL ALLOW ME
TO DO A LITTLE AGITATIN'.

182
00:09:09,681 --> 00:09:11,883
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
GOOD AT THAT.

183
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:19,724
IF MY VAN IS ROCKIN',

184
00:09:19,724 --> 00:09:22,260
I'M PROBABLY BLEACHIN'
MY UNDERWEAR.

185
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:29,701
OKAY, NOW WE HAVE
TO DRAIN THE WASHER

186
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:31,469
BEFORE TURNING IT
INTO A DRYER.

187
00:09:31,469 --> 00:09:34,205
THAT'S WHERE THE
HATCHBACK COMES IN HANDY.

188
00:09:35,673 --> 00:09:36,841
DONE.

189
00:09:39,677 --> 00:09:42,247
THIS FLOOR MAT IS MY
SHEET OF FABRIC SOFTENER.

190
00:09:46,684 --> 00:09:48,386
OKAY, NOW, FOR THE DRYING,

191
00:09:48,386 --> 00:09:50,355
I REALLY NEED TO
GENERATE SOME HOT AIR.

192
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:52,157
SO I TURNED THE
HEATER ON FULL,

193
00:09:52,157 --> 00:09:54,559
AND THEN I DRAINED THE RAD.

194
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:57,328
THEN YOU JUST
START HER UP.

195
00:09:57,996 --> 00:09:59,864
AND IT'S JUST THAT EASY.

196
00:09:59,864 --> 00:10:01,799
SO REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

197
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,801
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

198
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:05,236
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

199
00:10:05,236 --> 00:10:07,605
IT'S TIME FOR
THE SPIN CYCLE.

200
00:10:50,748 --> 00:10:53,117
"DRY CLEAN ONLY."

201
00:10:53,117 --> 00:10:56,154
[ APPLAUSE ]

202
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,029
THE OTHER DAY I'M DRIVING DOWN
THE HIGHWAY THERE,

203
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:07,298
AND I SEE A GUY NEARLY
MISS HIS EXIT.

204
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:10,001
SO HE CUTS ACROSS
FIVE LANES OF TRAFFIC

205
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:12,036
TO MAKE IT TO
THE OTHER SIDE.

206
00:11:12,036 --> 00:11:14,906
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO
END UP ON THE OTHER SIDE TOO.

207
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:17,108
THE FINAL OTHER SIDE.

208
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:18,976
THE ONE WITH
THE PEARLY GATES

209
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:21,379
AND MY OLD DOG PORKY,

210
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:25,049
WHO GOT CRUSHED BY A
RUNAWAY WHEEL OF CHEESE.

211
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:27,985
THIS GUY COULDN'T TAKE
THE NEXT EXIT AND COME BACK,

212
00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:29,720
BECAUSE AN EXTRA FOUR MINUTES
OUT OF HIS DAY

213
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,990
WAS APPARENTLY WORTH MORE
THAN THE REST OF MY LIFE.

214
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:36,327
THEN YESTERDAY, I'M AT THE
EXPRESS CHECKOUT LANE
AT THE SUPERMARKET,

215
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:39,964
AND THE OLD GUY IN FRONT
OF ME WITH 97 ITEMS

216
00:11:39,964 --> 00:11:43,468
REALISES HE'S FORGOTTEN
TO BUY A WATERMELON.

217
00:11:43,468 --> 00:11:45,303
SO HE DISAPPEARS
BACK INTO THE STORE

218
00:11:45,303 --> 00:11:47,405
WHILE I STAND THERE THINKING
ABOUT WHAT HE CAN DO

219
00:11:47,405 --> 00:11:50,408
WITH THAT WATERMELON
WHEN HE GETS BACK.

220
00:11:50,408 --> 00:11:52,610
THE COMMON THEME HERE
IS THAT SOME OF US

221
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,912
SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN AN
IMPORTANT CONCEPT.

222
00:11:54,912 --> 00:11:57,048
AND IT CAN BE SUMMED UP
IN TWO WORDS...

223
00:11:57,048 --> 00:11:58,716
TOO LATE.

224
00:11:58,716 --> 00:12:01,586
DON'T EVER BE AFRAID
TO TELL YOURSELF

225
00:12:01,586 --> 00:12:03,955
IT'S TOO LATE
TO DO SOMETHING.

226
00:12:03,955 --> 00:12:06,791
TOO LATE IS YOUR FRIEND,

227
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,860
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN
YOUR SELFISHNESS

228
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,262
MIGHT TICK OFF
THE WRONG PERSON.

229
00:12:11,262 --> 00:12:13,130
SOMEONE WITH
ANGER MANAGEMENT ISSUES

230
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,900
AND A FIREARM.

231
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,302
THEN IT COULD BE YOU IN
FRONT OF THOSE PEARLY GATES

232
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:20,605
PLAYING FETCH WITH PORKY.

233
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:22,473
OH, SURE, BY THAT
POINT YOU'RE SORRY.

234
00:12:22,473 --> 00:12:25,142
GUESS WHAT?
TOO LATE.

235
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:27,378
REMEMBER,
I'M PULLIN' FOR YOU.

236
00:12:27,378 --> 00:12:29,313
WE'RE ALL
IN THIS TOGETHER.

237
00:12:29,313 --> 00:12:32,016
[ APPLAUSE ]

238
00:12:32,016 --> 00:12:35,686
YOU NEED A SEWAGE GUY
YOU CAN GROW OLD WITH,

239
00:12:35,686 --> 00:12:38,122
BECAUSE REMEMBER,
YOUR SENSE OF SMELL

240
00:12:38,122 --> 00:12:40,691
IS THE LAST THING TO GO.

241
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,833
OKAY, IT'S BEEN FOUR HOURS
SINCE HAROLD WENT OVER
TO TELL BONNIE

242
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,935
THAT THEY'RE SEEIN'
TOO MUCH OF EACH OTHER.

243
00:12:50,935 --> 00:12:54,805
BY THIS POINT THEY'RE
PROBABLY SEEIN'
 ALL
OF EACH OTHER.

244
00:12:54,805 --> 00:12:57,942
BOY, THERE'S
A SCARY VISUAL.

245
00:12:57,942 --> 00:13:00,111
COME RIGHT IN.
COME RIGHT IN.

246
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:03,414
[ MUTTERING
TO EACH OTHER ]

247
00:13:05,883 --> 00:13:07,218
THE TWO OF YOU MIGHT
WANNA CUT BACK

248
00:13:07,218 --> 00:13:09,153
ON THE SUGAR INTAKE.

249
00:13:09,153 --> 00:13:11,188
HELLO, MR. GREEN.
HELLO, BONNIE.

250
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:13,891
HAROLD AND I HAD
A LITTLE TALK.

251
00:13:13,891 --> 00:13:16,494
WELL, I'M GLAD
TO HEAR THAT.

252
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:20,664
AND HAROLD SAID YOU HAVE
SOMETHING YOU WANTED
TO TELL ME.

253
00:13:30,574 --> 00:13:32,643
LET'S SAY I WANNA
BUY A CAR,

254
00:13:32,643 --> 00:13:36,313
AND THE ONLY DEALERSHIP
IN THE AREA IS A YUGO
DEALERSHIP.

255
00:13:36,313 --> 00:13:39,183
THAT MEANS THAT I'M
GONNA END UP WITH
A YUGO, RIGHT?

256
00:13:39,183 --> 00:13:40,885
I LOVE YUGOS!

257
00:13:40,885 --> 00:13:42,219
ME TOO!
I LOVE YUGOS!

258
00:13:42,219 --> 00:13:43,487
NO, NO, NO.

259
00:13:43,487 --> 00:13:45,589
NO, THAT'S
NOT THE POINT.

260
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:47,591
YOU GOTTA MAKE AN
INFORMED DECISION,

261
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:49,793
WHICH MEANS YOU GOTTA
LOOK AT ALL YOUR
OPTIONS.

262
00:13:49,793 --> 00:13:53,631
MM-HMM.
I LOVE YUGOS!

263
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:56,901
BONNIE, I THINK MY UNCLE'S
TRYING TO HELP US

264
00:13:56,901 --> 00:13:58,602
AVOID MAKING A MISTAKE.

265
00:13:58,602 --> 00:14:01,872
HE'S SAYING MAYBE WE STOP
SEEING EACH OTHER FOR
A LITTLE WHILE --

266
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:03,807
JUST A LITTLE WHILE.
SEE HOW IT WORKS OUT.

267
00:14:03,807 --> 00:14:05,576
SEE IF WE REALLY
CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER.

268
00:14:05,576 --> 00:14:07,545
EXACTLY.

269
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:10,014
WELL, IF YOU SAY SO,
HAROLD.

270
00:14:10,014 --> 00:14:11,815
I MEAN,
WE COULD TRY IT.

271
00:14:11,815 --> 00:14:13,751
WE COULD STOP SEEING
EACH OTHER FOR LIKE...

272
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:15,185
AN HOUR.
A DAY.

273
00:14:15,185 --> 00:14:16,353
A MONTH.

274
00:14:16,353 --> 00:14:18,122
A WEEK.
ALL RIGHT.

275
00:14:18,122 --> 00:14:20,124
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT
TO GET TOGETHER JUST
OUT OF CONVENIENCE.

276
00:14:20,124 --> 00:14:21,525
I GUESS NOT.

277
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:24,228
NO, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
MY AUNT BERNICE DID, AND...

278
00:14:32,236 --> 00:14:33,904
Red: THE BOYS ARE OUT
ON A SUMMER'S DAY,

279
00:14:33,904 --> 00:14:35,439
LOOKING FOR A
DIFFERENT BEACH.

280
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:37,308
AND THEY WERE
JUST CRUISIN' ALONG,

281
00:14:37,308 --> 00:14:38,876
AND BILL WAS FEEDING HAROLD,

282
00:14:38,876 --> 00:14:41,679
KEEPING HIM HAPPY
IN THE BACK SEAT THERE.

283
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:45,716
AND THEY SAW A SIGN THAT
THEY HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

284
00:14:49,853 --> 00:14:54,892
'COURSE THEY DIDN'T REALISE
THE SIGN HAD A LITTLE MORE
TO IT THAN THAT.

285
00:14:54,892 --> 00:14:57,728
SO NOW WE'RE OPERATING
UNDER WHAT WE CALL

286
00:14:57,728 --> 00:14:59,997
FALSE PRETENSES,

287
00:14:59,997 --> 00:15:03,700
WHICH PRETTY WELL DESCRIBES
THEIR ENTIRE LIVES.

288
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,270
SO WALTER AND BILL JUST CAN'T
GET OUT OF THE CAR FAST ENOUGH.

289
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,038
SCRAMBLE UP AND SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON

290
00:15:08,038 --> 00:15:09,907
AT THE NUDE BEACH.

291
00:15:09,907 --> 00:15:11,975
AND HAROLD HAS A LITTLE
MORE COMMON SENSE

292
00:15:11,975 --> 00:15:13,977
AND, YOU KNOW, FAIR PLAY.

293
00:15:13,977 --> 00:15:16,513
HE SAYS, HEY, GUYS.
HEY, HEY, HEY.

294
00:15:16,513 --> 00:15:20,584
YOU GOTTA BE ONE
TO SEE ONE.

295
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:25,022
SO NOW THEY GOTTA
MAKE A DECISION.

296
00:15:25,022 --> 00:15:27,024
ARE YOU GONNA OR NOT

297
00:15:27,024 --> 00:15:29,293
OR NOT...

298
00:15:29,293 --> 00:15:31,728
OR... OKAY, THEY'RE
GONNA GO FOR IT.

299
00:15:31,728 --> 00:15:33,564
ALL RIGHT.
DECIDED TO PAY THE PRICE.

300
00:15:33,564 --> 00:15:34,865
HAROLD HAS A GREAT IDEA.

301
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:36,800
THEY'VE GOT SOME
TOYS AND SO ON

302
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,102
THEY CAN USE TO COVER UP SOME
OF THE EMBARRASSING BITS.

303
00:15:39,102 --> 00:15:41,171
AND THE RUBBER DUCKIE AND EVEN
USING THE COOLER THERE.

304
00:15:41,171 --> 00:15:44,842
AND THERE WAS ONE OF THOSE
POP-OUT PUP TENT THINGS.

305
00:15:44,842 --> 00:15:47,411
AND, UH, SO WALTER
GRABS A COOLER,

306
00:15:47,411 --> 00:15:49,880
AND HE TAKES THE
BOTTOM OUT OF HER

307
