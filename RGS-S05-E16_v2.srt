IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW"!

HERE'S A MAN WHO'S ALWAYS FUN

00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:14,647
TO GET UP CLOSE
AND PERSONAL WITH,

00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:16,616
ESPECIALLY AFTER BATH NIGHT,

7
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:20,453
YOUR HOST, MY UNCLE, RED GREEN!

00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,194
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THE WHOLE POSSUM LAKE AREA'S

12
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:33,700
IN A FLAP OVER... WHO GOT LOST?

13
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,668
SCOTTIE.

14
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:37,203
YEAH, RIGHT, SCOTTIE.

15
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,407
SOME 3-YEAR-OLD NAMED SCOTTIE
WENT INTO THE WOODS

16
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:42,876
AND -- SURPRISE, SURPRISE --
GOT LOST.

17
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:45,712
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO RUN OUT
AND LOOK FOR HIM.

18
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,214
COME ON, THINK ABOUT IT --
POOR LITTLE SCOTTIE

19
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:49,549
IN THE WOODS--

20
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:50,984
OH, COME ON, HAROLD.

21
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,585
THE KID'S 3 YEARS OLD.

22
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:54,487
LET HIM TOUGH IT OUT, HUH?

23
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,957
WHEN I WAS A KID,
WE'D WALK FIVE MILES TO SCHOOL.

24
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,860
WE DROPPED OUT,
BUT WE WOULD HAVE WALKED.

25
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:04,297
I SAY LET SCOTTIE DUKE IT OUT
WITH SOME WOLVERINE

26
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:05,732
FOR CAVE SPACE, THERE.

27
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,067
BUT, UNCLE RED--

28
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:08,701
MAKE A MAN OF HIM.

29
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:11,104
PROBABLY RUN ON ALL FOURS.

30
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:12,439
SCOTTIE IS A DOG.

31
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:13,640
WHAT?
A DOG.

32
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:15,275
LITTLE
SCOTCH TERRIER.

33
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:16,910
A LITTLE SCOTTIE DOG?

34
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:19,312
THE BLACK MOUSTACHE
AND PERKY EARS

35
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,381
AND YOU CAN'T SEE THE LEGS?

36
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:22,715
THAT'S SCOTTIE.

37
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:24,984
WE GOT A LOST DOG TO LOOK FOR!

38
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:26,553

(Red): TODAY,
HAROLD MAKES HIMSELF

43
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,539
EVEN GEEKIER THAN USUAL,

44
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,541
RANGER GORD TURNS HIS BRAIN

45
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,976
INTO A COMPUTER...

46
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,544
OH, BOY.

47
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,547
WE GOT WINSTON WITH
A LITTLE SCARY ADVICE,

48
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:58,418
AND HAP IS LYING FOR ALL
HE'S WORTH, WHICH AIN'T MUCH.

49
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:06,826
A DOG WILL TREAT YOU BETTER
THAN ANY HUMAN WILL.

50
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,262
THAT'S WHY WE GOTTA RESCUE
THAT TERRIER.

51
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,597
YOU CAN TRUST A DOG.

52
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,699
A DOG WON'T LIE TO YOU.

53
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:14,267
DOG WON'T STEAL YOUR CAR.

54
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,402
EXCEPT THAT DOG
MOOSE THOMPSON HAD.

55
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,837
THAT WAS MOOSE'S FAULT.

56
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,472
COCKER SPANIELS ARE SMART.

57
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,541
TEACHING IT TO FETCH
THE CAR KEYS,

58
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,309
IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

59
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,645
TILL THE DOG
PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER.

60
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:28,047
NO, SIR, WE OWE IT
TO EVERY DOG

61
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:30,083
TO GO AND RESCUE SCOTTIE.

62
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,286
WE OWE OURSELVES
THE $200 REWARD FOR SCOTTIE.

63
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,655
SCOTTIE'S OWNERS
ARE REALLY RICH.

64
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,624
EVERYBODY AND HIS BROTHER'S

65
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,993
OUT IN THE WOODS
LOOKING FOR HIM.

66
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,828
DON'T FORGET,
IT'S POSSUM WOODS.

67
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,396
THAT'S NO WALK IN THE PARK.

68
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:46,599
NO, THAT'S A WALK IN THE WOODS.

69
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:50,436
REMEMBER WHEN ME AND YOU USED
TO GO WALKING IN THE WOODS?

70
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,739
WE USED TO GO WALKING
IN THE WOODS,

71
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:54,941
AND SOMEHOW,
WE'D ALWAYS GET SEPARATED.

72
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,609
HA! REMEMBER THAT?

73
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,611
WOW!

74
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,614
I'D HAVE TO FIND
MY OWN WAY HOME.

75
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,183
BUT I DID IT.

76
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,118
I KEPT COMING BACK.

77
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,819
YEAH, YOU
DID, HAROLD.

78
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:09,122
I GUESS I'M PART BLOODHOUND.

79
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,623
NOT THE GOOD
PART.

FOR THAT LOST DOG

82
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:21,601
BY MAKING SOME SORT
OF A DIRIGIBLE ZEPPELIN THING.

FROM THE LOCAL CIRCUS
OR FLOWER SHOP.

85
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,142
GOT TOO MUCH
FOR THE TABLE, BILL.

86
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,643
THERE YOU GO.

87
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,978
OH, OH, OH!

88
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,313
OH, BY GOLLY.

00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,647
WOW! WHOA!

00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,249
THIS MAY TAKE A WHILE.

91
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,151
HELIUM'S LIGHTER THAN AIR.

92
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,120
SORT OF LIKE YOUR BRAIN.

93
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,723
OK, THIS IS THE BIG ONE!

94
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,325
THE GRAND PRIZE IS FROM

00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,794
MR. ED'S END OF LINE
AND ODD LOTS --

A CASE OF QUEBEC NORDIQUE
HOCKEY UNIFORMS.

97
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:52,865
UNCLE RED, YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS

98
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:55,668
TO GET MR. HUMPHREY
TO SAY THIS WORD.

99
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,405
THIRTY SECONDS, AND GO.

100
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:00,873
UH, ALL RIGHT.

101
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,208
EMOTIONS.

102
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,110
UH, MESSY.

103
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:05,612
NO, EMOTIONS.

104
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:06,946
WEIRD.

105
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,015
NO, WHAT'S IN YOUR HEART.

106
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,851
TRIPLE BYPASS.

107
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,454
YOU KNOW, THE STUFF
THAT'S IN THERE.

108
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,955
CHOLESTEROL.

109
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,390
NO, NO, NO.

110
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:21,761
WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS SOMETHING
MEAN, IT HURTS YOUR...

111
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,363
... CHANCES FOR PROMOTION.

112
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,864
[audience laughing]

113
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,634
THE WAY YOU REACT
TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY...

114
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,135
DEFENCE
MECHANISMS.

115
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,138
YOUR TIME'S ALMOST UP,
UNCLE RED.

116
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,941
THE MOST ANNOYING SONG
EVER WRITTEN.

117
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,442
"FEELINGS"!

00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:39,412
[applause]

119
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:44,083
OH, I CAN SING LOW
AS A BULLFROG 

120
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,488
EVEN WHEN
THEY'RE IN HEAT 

121
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:51,858
BUT I CAN'T SING
AS HIGH AS AN EAGLE 

122
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:55,662
BECAUSE THEY SING
AT 20,000 FEET! 

123
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,265
A LOT OF FOLKS TRY

124
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,501
TO KEEP DOGS FROM RUNNING AWAY

125
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,835
BY FENCING THEM IN,

126
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,170
TYING THEM UP,

127
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,605
PUTTING THEM ON A LEASH.

128
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,006
THAT WORKS ON HUSBANDS.

129
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,641
THAT IS BACKWARDS THINKING.

130
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,044
TODAY ON "HANDYMAN CORNER",
I'LL SHOW YOU

131
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,313
HOW TO KEEP YOUR DOG
FROM RUNNING AWAY

132
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:14,947
BY TREATING HIM LIKE A GOD.

133
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,282
SEE THE WORDS?

134
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,617
"DOG", "GOD", EH?

135
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,653
THAT'S BACKWARDS SPELLING,
NOT BACKWARDS THINKING.

136
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,088
ALL DOGS LOVE TO EAT.

137
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,725
WHY NOT SERVE FOOD IN SOMETHING
THEY LIKE TO EAT OUT OF?

138
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,328
EVEN THE WORST RESTAURANTS
WILL TELL YOU

139
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,129
PRESENTATION IS EVERYTHING.

140
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:33,633
DON'T LET HIM EAT
OUT OF THE TOP OF THE CAN.

141
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,136
SNUG THE LID DOWN,
PUNCH A HOLE IN THE BACK.

142
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:39,706
THE DOG HAS TO WORK A BIT
FOR THE FOOD.

143
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,774
NOT ONLY DOES HE FEED HIMSELF,

144
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,577
HE FEELS LIKE
HE'S DOING SOMETHING NAUGHTY.

145
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,579
SAME THING WITH DRINKING WATER.

146
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:50,216
PUT THE WATER IN SOMETHING
THE DOG LIKES TO DRINK OUT OF.

147
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,751
WHAT DOG WILL LEAVE HOME

148
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,554
WHEN YOU GOT EVERYTHING HE WANTS
RIGHT HERE?

149
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,689
IT'S KIND OF
A REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY,

150
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,591
EXCEPT YOU DO IT BACKWARDS...

151
00:05:58,658 --> 00:05:59,926
LIKE "GOD" AND "DOG".

152
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:01,928
IT'S IN THEIR GENES
OR HORMONES.

153
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,263
LIKE THE WAY THEY LIKE
TO CHEW SHOES.

154
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,665
BUY A BUNCH OF SHOES.

155
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:09,102
YOU CAN GET A PILE FOR ABOUT
FIVE BUCKS AT A YARD SALE.

156
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:10,837
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

157
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,905
"ALL YOU'RE DOING
IS ENCOURAGING

158
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,640
"ALL THE DOG'S BAD HABITS.

159
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,443
"THEY SHOULD SEND HIM
TO OBEDIENCE SCHOOL."

160
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,313
HECK, IF YOU'RE GONNA SPEND
100 BUCKS OR SO,

161
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,815
WHY NOT BUY
A GREAT DOGGY TOY INSTEAD?

162
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,384
DOGS LOVE TO CHASE CARS.

163
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,352
GIVE HIM HIS OWN CAR TO CHASE.

164
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,554
I'VE DUCT-TAPED
THE STEERING WHEEL

165
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,256
IN THE FULL-TURN POSITION.

166
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:31,657
I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY

167
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,627
ABOUT THE DOG OR THE CAR
LEAVING THE PROPERTY.

168
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:38,131
WOULDN'T WANT THIS UNIT ON
THE HIGHWAY WITH NO DRIVER.

169
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,466
IT WILL LOSE A WHEEL DISK.

170
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,602
ALL RIGHT, START HER UP.

171
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,238
DROP HER INTO GEAR
AND SHE'S ON HER WAY.

172
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,943
WITH A TANK OF GAS,
THAT BABY WILL RUN FOR A WEEK.

173
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,881
YOU'RE THINKING, "THE DOG'S GOT
FOOD, WATER, RECREATION --

174
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,616
"HE'S NEVER GONNA LEAVE."

175
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,085
HE MIGHT -- HE NEEDS
ONE MORE THING: ROMANCE.

176
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,420
DOGS GET LONELY.

177
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:03,489
I THINK IT'S THE MAIN REASON
THEY DO STRAY.

178
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:07,093
YOUR DOG WILL NEVER LEAVE
IF YOU GOT ONE OF THESE.

179
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,428
LOOK AT THAT.

180
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,530
GET A LEG UP
ON THE COMPETITION.

181
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,331
OR, AS WE SAY AT THE LODGE,

182
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,600
WHY WOULD YOU GO OUT
FOR HAMBURGER

183
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,602
IF YOU GOT POLYESTER AT HOME?

184
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,171
I'M NOT DONE WITH THIS.

185
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,306
I'LL WIRE IN
SOME SOFT LIGHTING,

186
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,809
PUT IN SOME DISCO MUSIC,
A LAVA LAMP,

187
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,277
BUT I'LL GET TO THAT.

188
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,013
REMEMBER, IF THE WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

189
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,948
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

190
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,283
WHERE ARE MY TOOLS?

191
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,684
RIGHT.

192
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,463
STAY TUNED FOR HAROLD
AND HIS MAP.

193
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,465
LOOK HOW DUMB HE LOOKS.

194
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:52,371
GETTING OLDER MEANS
YOU GOT THE TIME AND MONEY

195
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,907
TO PURSUE THE INTERESTS
YOU'VE PUT OFF

196
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,576
TILL THE KIDS ARE GROWN.

197
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,278
YOU GET YOURSELF A DIRT BIKE
OR A JET SKI

198
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,814
OR ONE OF THEM
FLAMING HANG GLIDERS...

199
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,382
[audience laughing]

200
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,885
THEN THE KIDS START SHOWING UP

201
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,821
AT THE FRONT DOOR
ALL OF A SUDDEN...

202
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,824
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO SHARE,
AND THAT'S FINE.

203
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,159
YOU'RE OLD NOW.

204
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:16,028
YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL GUILTY
ANY MORE.

205
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:19,131
HERE'S WHAT YOU DO
TO GET RID OF THE KIDS.

206
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:22,335
USE THE OLD GUY'S
SECRET WEAPON -- BOREDOM.

207
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,104
OH, YEAH, START TALKING
ABOUT THE WEATHER

208
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,740
OR YOUR LATEST OPERATION
OR SOMETHING.

209
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,810
YOU'LL THINK OF SOMETHING --
YOU'RE OLD NOW.

210
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:35,081
YOU'VE ONLY BEGUN TO TAP IN TO
YOUR POTENTIAL TO BORE PEOPLE.

211
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:39,051
THE KIDS WILL GO AWAY AND PLAY
A VIDEO GAME OR HOPSCOTCH,

212
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,287
MAYBE KNOCK OVER
A LIQUOR STORE.

213
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,657
YOU GET TO PLAY WITH YOUR TOYS
ALL BY YOURSELF.

214
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,459
REMEMBER, I'M PULLING FOR YOU.

215
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,127
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

216
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,930
[applause]

217
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,798
COME IN -- CHECK, ANYONE.

218
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,300
ANYONE, COME IN.

219
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,801
COME IN, ANYONE.

220
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,803
ANYONE, COME IN.

221
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,306
CHECK ONE, HELLO.

222
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,807
COME IN.

223
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,809
YEAH, HAROLD,
IT'S UNCLE RED -- OVER.

224
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,379
OH, EXCELLENT, UNCLE RED,
THAT'S SO GREAT!

225
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,481
YOU'RE COMING IN FIVE BY FIVE.

226
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,316
THAT MEANS LOUD AND CLEAR.

227
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,553
I'LL HAVE A CHEESEBURGER
AND A LARGE FRIES.

228
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:16,355
SHOULD I DRIVE
TO THE SECOND WINDOW?

229
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,758
[screaming]

230
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,760
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE THERE.

231
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,596
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
WITH THE SEARCH PARTY.

232
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:24,931
THEY JUST LEFT.

233
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,033
SEARCH PARTY LEFT
THREE HOURS AGO.

234
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,367
THE FIRST ONE DID.

235
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,603
THIS PARTY'S LOOKING
FOR THE SEARCH PARTY.

236
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,605
I'VE NARROWED DOWN
THEIR LOCATION.

237
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,875
I'M USING ARMY MEN
TO REPRESENT THE VOLUNTEERS,

238
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,044
BECAUSE KNOWING
IS HALF THE BATTLE.

239
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,378
THEY'RE UP HERE

240
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:40,713
AT ROCK REEF POINT.

241
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,549
YOU KNOW WHERE THAT
STUDEBAKER'S WEDGED IN?

242
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:47,320
THEN I GOT NOTICE THEY WERE
GOING SWIMMING AT FOAM FALLS.

243
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:50,590
THAT'S THE LAST I HEARD OF 'EM,
SO WHAT DID I DO?

244
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,625
I GOT THE SECOND SEARCH PARTY,

245
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:56,596
WHICH I CALL THE SEARCH PARTY
SEARCH PARTY, OR THE S.P.S.P.,

246
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:59,131
AND I'VE GOT THEM
AT WORK SOCKS SWAMP.

247
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,466
YOU KNOW WHERE

248
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,669
THE MARSH GAS IGNITES
WHEN CARS GO BY?

249
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,972
NO WORD FROM THEM, EITHER.

250
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,708
YOU CAN TAKE MOOSE THOMPSON
OFF THERE.

251
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:12,912
HE'S OVER AT MERCURY CREEK
WITH HIS HEAD IN MY TRAP.

252
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:16,682
IT'S MY FAULT FOR BAITING IT
WITH A PORK CHOP.

253
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:20,286
WHY DIDN'T YOU USE FOOD
THAT MOOSE WOULDN'T EAT?

254
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,754
SUCH AS WHAT?

255
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,356
ASPHALT?

256
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:28,060
[laughing and applause]

257
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,796
THE TRICK TO NOT GETTING LOST
IN THE WOODS

258
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,366
IS TO KNOW EVERY SINGLE ROCK
AND TREE IN IT.

259
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:34,734
TEST ME ON THIS.

260
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,269
OVER THERE,
THERE'S A FALLEN BIRCH LOG,

261
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,505
A ROCK STICKING OUT
OF THE GROUND,

262
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:42,108
SOME LICHEN MOSS
IN THE SHAPE OF AN "S",

263
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,644
PINE CONES, A TREE
WITH LEAVES ON IT --

264
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,880
32 GREEN LEAVES, ONE YELLOW
LEAF, ONE BROWN LEAF.

265
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,316
BESIDE THAT, THERE'S TWO ROCKS.

266
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,885
BESIDE THAT,
THERE'S A PINE CONE.

267
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,321
WELL, YOU MISSED
A PINE CONE THERE.

268
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,490
ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE, THERE.

269
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,925
YOU WERE CLOSE, THOUGH,
VERY CLOSE.

270
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,394
THAT WAS GOOD, YEAH.

271
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,396
MUST HAVE FALLEN
JUST THIS WEEK.

272
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:04,730
OH, ALL RIGHT.

273
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,566
I'D BETTER ADD THAT
INTO THE OLD COMPUTER.

274
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:10,736
FOR YOU YOUNG KIDS,
IT'S MY NEW INTELLIVISION.

275
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:13,739
[beeping and whirring]

276
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,074
[grunting]

277
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:18,411
[humming]

278
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:21,414
[whirring]

279
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,748
THERE WE GO.

280
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,350
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME CHEESECAKE?

281
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,053
WOW! YOU GOT FOOD HIDDEN
IN THE WOODS?

282
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,587
JUST LIKE A SQUIRREL.

283
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:31,590
OVER THERE, I'VE GOT
A NICE ROAST OF BEEF.

284
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:34,727
UP THAT OAK, I'VE GOT
A NICE CAESAR'S SALAD.

285
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,229
ALTHOUGH SQUIRRELS HIDE
THEIR NUTS,

286
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,365
PEOPLE DON'T USUALLY DO THAT.

287
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,267
WELL, I DON'T KNOW, GORD.

288
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,436
NOBODY KNOWS WHERE YOU ARE.

289
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,973
YOU'VE DATED HER
ABOUT FIVE TIMES.

290
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,010
YOU'RE GETTING INTO A NICE,
COMFORTABLE ROUTINE.

291
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:54,280
PICK HER UP AT 7:00,
BURGERS AT 8:00, HOME BY 11:00.

292
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:57,383
THEN SHE GOES AND THROWS
A MONKEY INTO THE WRENCH

293
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,919
AND LOOKS AT YOU AND SAYS...

294
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,387
"I LOVE YOU".

295
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,889
[audience laughing]

296
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,725
IT'S FUNNY, ISN'T IT,

297
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,761
HOW THREE LITTLE WORDS
CAN SCARE A MAN?

298
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,896
LIKE "NO MORE BEER".

299
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,898
YEAH.

300
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:15,601
OR "THAT'S MY HUSBAND!"

301
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,269
[audience laughing]

302
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,939
NONE IS WORSE THAN "I LOVE YOU".

303
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,273
THAT'S THE BIGGIE.

304
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,275
DON'T ANSWER HER,
DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

305
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:24,610
SHE KNOWS YOU'RE A MAN.

306
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,846
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO EXPRESS YOURSELF.

307
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,348
SHE'LL THINK
YOU'RE THE STRONG, SILENT TYPE.

308
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,350
THIS BUYS YOU SOME TIME.

309
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,885
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

310
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:36,489
WHEN A WOMAN SAYS "I LOVE YOU",
COULD MEAN A COUPLE OF THINGS.

311
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,657
SHE MIGHT BE ENDING
THE RELATIONSHIP.

312
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,860
SHE'S TRYING TO FORCE YOU
TO RUN AWAY.

313
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,529
WOMEN WILL SAY "I LOVE YOU"
TO SPARK UP

314
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,198
AN OTHERWISE DEAD-END
RELATIONSHIP, TOO.

315
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,368
MIGHT BE TRYING
TO JUMP-START HER OWN FEELINGS.

316
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,870
RIGHT, OR YOURS.

317
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,872
GO HOME AND
DON'T CALL HER AGAIN.

318
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,874
YEAH.

319
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,009
WHEN A WOMAN SAYS "I LOVE YOU",

320
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:59,378
THERE'S NO TELLING
WHAT
 SHE MEANS!

321
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:03,382
[laughing and applause]

322
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,652
HEY, HANDYMEN, YOU WANT TO MAKE
A STRAIGHT CUT

323
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,687
BUT DON'T HAVE A CHALK LINE?

324
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,456
THIS WORKS JUST AS WELL.

325
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,291
THE OLD RUSTY SAW BLADE.

326
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,061
PERFECT.

327
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,899
[high-pitched voice]:
OH, I FELL OFF!

328
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,400
I CAN'T SWIM!

329
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,469
PUT THOSE PLASTIC
VOLUNTEERS AWAY.

330
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,371
I'M ON THE TRAIL OF THAT DOG.

331
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,973
I'M JUST LOOKING
FOR THE SEARCH PARTIES.

332
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,676
I WISH I KNEW
WHERE OLD MAN SEDGWICK WAS.

333
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,412
HE KNOWS THESE WOODS
BETTER THAN ANYBODY.

334
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,948
HE'S OVER BY MERCURY CREEK.

335
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,450
HE WAS STANDING IN THE TREES,
PANTING LIKE A BEAGLE.

336
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:41,320
HE'LL NEVER CATCH
THE LOST DOG THAT WAY.

337
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:42,755
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

338
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,657
HE SAID, "WHAT LOST DOG?"

339
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:47,293
[audience laughing]

340
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:50,462
I'D TRY OVER BY POSSUM LAKE
SKI AND GOLF CLUB.

341
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:54,633
SOME OF THE GOLFERS ARE FINDING
SURPRISES IN THE SAND TRAPS.

342
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,135
NO, NO, NO,
UNCLE RED.

343
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,603
YOU CAN'T GO THERE.

344
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,039
REMEMBER THE RESTRAINING ORDER.

345
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:01,640
I'M NOT GOING THERE.

346
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:02,975
I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

347
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,878
I'M GONNA RENT
A PAIR OF BAGPIPES.

348
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:09,882
I'M GONNA PLAY THEM
AND I FIGURE IT'S GONNA LURE--

349
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,318
HEY! HEY, IT'S A SCOTTIE DOG.

350
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,887
I THINK THE BAGPIPES
WILL BRING

351
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,456
THE SCOTTIE DOG--
I WOULDN'T GO NEAR 'EM,

352
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,491
BUT BAGPIPES LURE SCOTTIE DOGS.

353
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,894
[audience laughing]

354
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,162
WELL, UNCLE RED...

355
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,697
[laughing]

356
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:29,335
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY NEED
TO INSULT OUR SCOTTISH VIEWERS.

357
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:30,836
[laughing and applause]

358
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,505
MAYBE NOT,
BUT IT'S SO MUCH FUN, HAROLD.

359
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:36,308
WHEN I GET THE BAGPIPES,
I'LL PLAY A POLKA

360
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,845
AND INSULT OUR EUROPEAN VIEWERS
AND HALF OF BUFFALO.

361
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:43,215
[laughing and applause]

362
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:46,352
(Red): MEANWHILE,
BACK AT THE HINDENBURG,

363
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:49,121
BILL HAD ATTACHED --
BEAUTIFUL! --

364
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,023
HELIUM-FILLED BALLOONS
TO THE CHAIR--

365
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,358
BILL, THE LAWN CHAIR.

366
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:54,193
BILL, IT'S... IT'S... IT'S...

367
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,761
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TIE THAT

368
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,696
TO THE GROUND OR SOMETHING...

369
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,466
WE GOT A HEAVIER CHAIR,
AND MORE BALLOONS.

370
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,368
WHERE DO YOU WANT THIS TIED?

371
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:03,869
OH!

372
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,638
I DON'T THINK THAT HELPS.

373
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,439
THERE WE GO, THERE WE GO.

374
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:09,842
THERE'S A SPOT
WITH THE FOOT-REST.

375
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,744
YOU CAN TIE THAT ON THERE.

376
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,080
WE GOT 80, 90, 100, 200, 300...
PROBABLY ABOUT

377
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:16,782
70, 40 BALLOONS UP THERE.

378
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,051
SHE'S STARTING TO--
OH, HANG ON, BILL.

379
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,386
SHE'S GOING UP.

380
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:23,022
BILL, DON'T LET--
BILL, YOU'RE-- NO, NO.

381
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,324
YOU WANT TO BE IN THE UNIT
WHEN IT--

382
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,825
BILL, YOU NEED TO BE--

383
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,327
UP YOU GO.

384
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,662
GIVE ME A BOOST.

385
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,597
I'LL GIVE YOU-- YOU GIVE ME--

386
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,465
NO, YOU GIVE ME-- YOU, ME...

387
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:34,800
OH, FORGET IT.

388
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,869
NOW HE'S GOT A BEANBAG CHAIR.

389
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,203
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

390
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,005
YOU'LL FILL THAT WITH HELIUM?

391
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,407
I GOT BAD NEWS.

392
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,143
WE SEEM TO BE HITTING
AROUND ZERO

393
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,678
ON THE HELIUM SCALE.

394
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,012
NO PROBLEM?

395
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,013
YOU'VE GOT WHAT?

396
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,648
YOU'VE GOT HELIUM IN THERE?

397
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:50,983
I DON'T THINK SO.

398
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,318
WHAT HAVE WE GOT?

399
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:55,988
IT'S PROPANE --
THAT'S PROPANE, BILL.

400
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,190
THAT'S NOT HELIUM.

401
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,659
IT'S NOT GOING TO GO UP.

402
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:04,029
I THINK PROPANE IS
ABOUT THE SAME WEIGHT AS AIR.

403
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,364
IT'S ABOUT THE SAME.

404
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,699
NO, IT'S HEAVIER.

405
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,734
PROPANE IS HEAVIER THAN AIR.

406
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,703
THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH, YEAH.

407
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,138
BILL'S GONNA EMPTY THE BEANBAG.

408
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,808
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S GOT IN MIND.

409
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,876
HE'S GONNA EMPTY THAT OUT.

410
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:21,046
IT'S BEGINNING TO LOOK
A LOT LIKE TROUBLE 

411
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:26,151
ANYWAY, WE FILLED THOSE
BALLOONS WITH THE PROPANE SO...

412
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:28,754
DANGEROUS, BUT THEY'RE
NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

413
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,556
HOW DO YOU GO UP IN THE AIR?

414
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,325
YOU'VE SOLVED THE PROBLEM
OF FLOATING AWAY--

415
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,693
MATCHES! OH, MATCHES!

416
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,028
OH, MATCHES, YEAH.

417
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,197
I'M LONG GONE,
AND WHO CAN BLAME ME?

418
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:39,965
YOU'RE GONNA STRIKE THAT UP.

419
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,533
THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

420
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,003
YOU'RE SITTING ON 400 POUNDS
OF PROPANE.

421
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:47,406
WELL, YOU WERE SITTING ON THAT.

422
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,008
WONDER WHERE HE IS.

423
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:50,843
OH, HE'S LOOKING GOOD.

424
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,378
I HOPE YOU'RE LOOKING

425
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:55,447
FOR THE DOG -- YOU MAY NOT BE
UP THERE TOO LONG.

426
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,883
THERE'S THE LAZY-- WHOA!

427
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,852
OH, FOR GOSH SAKES!

428
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,553
[laughing]

429
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,655
WHAT A PLAN.

430
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,391
STAY TUNED AS HAROLD SAYS

431
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,026
NOTHING MAKES ME LAUGH.

432
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,427
HE'S WRONG.

433
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,034
BAGPIPES WORKED, HAROLD.

434
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,802
I CAUGHT THE MISSING DOG.

435
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,670
YOU WERE JUST LUCKY.

436
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,105
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HAND?

437
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,440
WELL, I THOUGHT...

438
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,308
OK, WHAT WOULD LURE
A BOY SCOTTIE DOG

439
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,643
OFF A GOLF COURSE?

440
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,978
YOU KNOW -- DING!

441
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,113
A BELL WENT OFF IN MY HEAD.

442
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,448
DING!

443
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,518
I THOUGHT,
"OK, A GIRL SCOTTIE DOG."

444
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:34,486
BUT WE DON'T HAVE ONE.

445
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,890
I THOUGHT, "I'LL DISGUISE
MOOSE THOMPSON'S DOG AS ONE."

446
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,792
MOOSE THOMPSON'S DOG
IS A ROTTWEILER.

447
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,126
IS IT EVER!

448
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,429
DIDN'T SEEM TO MIND

449
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:47,099
WHEN I PUT THE BAY CITY ROLLERS
SCARF ON HIM, OR THE TAM.

450
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,102
I FIGURE THIS KILT WAS
ABOUT A SIZE TWO SMALL.

451
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,637
[audience laughing]

452
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:52,971
TOUCHY!

453
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:54,706
OH, BOY, THOSE ROTTWEILERS --

454
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,376
I THINK THEY'RE OVER-BRED.

455
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,978
YOU SHOULD BE SO LUCKY, HAROLD.

456
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:01,613
TELL YOU WHAT, THOUGH.

457
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,049
I'LL SPLIT THE REWARD WITH YOU.

458
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,417
OH, OK, ALL RIGHT.

459
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,985
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

460
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:09,054
LIKE, 100 EACH OR SOMETHING?

461
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:10,923
WELL, YEAH, AFTER EXPENSES.

462
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:13,859
WE GOTTA SUBTRACT GAS,
SUPPLIES, BEVERAGES,

463
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:17,096
BAGPIPE RENTAL AND BAGPIPE
REPLACEMENT, OF COURSE.

464
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,430
SO WHAT?

465
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,765
WE BREAK EVEN?

466
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,101
WE WILL IF YOU CHIP IN
15 BUCKS.

467
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,103
THAT'S NOT BAD!

468
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,972
[laughing and applause]

469
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,607
IT'S "MALE CALL"!

470
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,109
[applause and cheering]

471
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:31,610
HAROLD.

472
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:32,945
[laughing]

473
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,279
THAT'S LOUD!

474
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,747
OK, HERE'S A LETTER.

475
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,883
FIRST LETTER GOES AS FOLLOWS,

476
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,586
AND IT'S FROM LOUISE LAKE
FROM HELENA.

477
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:43,122
NO, THAT'S HELENA
FROM LAKE LOUISE.

478
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:44,623
ALL RIGHT, UM...

479
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,659
"DEAR RED,
WHAT MAKES YOU LAUGH?"

480
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:50,129
GOOD QUESTION --
NOTHING, THAT'S WHAT.

481
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,463
[laughing]

482
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,665
HE LAUGHS AT ZIP, NADA.

483
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,033
THAT'S NOT TRUE, HAROLD.

484
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,535
I LAUGH AT LOTS OF THINGS.

485
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:57,936
NAME ONE THING.

486
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:00,439
NOTHING, THAT'S WHAT --
NOTHING.

487
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:01,773
[laughing]

488
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,175
I'M NOT LIKE YOU.

489
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,710
YOU GIGGLE AT AIR.

490
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,812
LOTS OF THINGS I LAUGH AT.

491
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,180
WHAT?

492
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,649
MAYBE NOT THAT SO MUCH...
BUT THERE'S OTHER...

493
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:11,984
YES?

494
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,652
THERE'S OTHER...
THERE'S SOMETHING I LAUGH AT.

495
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:14,987
NOTHING.

496
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:16,321
LET ME THINK.

497
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:17,656
THERE'S NOTHING.

498
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:18,991
I KNOW!

499
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,492
WHOA!

500
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,827
THAT'S IT!

501
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,162
YEAH, THAT'S IT!

502
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,230
[laughing]

503
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,432
HERE WE ARE
WITH HAP SHAUGHNESSY.

504
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,101
WHAT ARE WE FISHING FOR?

505
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,502
BASS, RED.

506
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,672
THAT'S WHAT THE BIG T.V.
CELEBRITIES LIKE TO FISH FOR.

507
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,007
[laughing]

508
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:38,177
COME ON, HAP,
I'M NOT A BIG T.V. CELEBRITY.

509
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:39,545
I DIDN'T MEAN YOU.

510
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:42,881
I MEAN PEOPLE I MET WHEN I WAS
A HOLLYWOOD DIRECTOR.

511
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:46,685
NAMES YOU WOULDN'T REMEMBER,
LIKE THAT KID FROM "RAWHIDE".

512
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,020
EASTWOOD, CLINT.

513
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:50,489
HE DID THAT ONE SHOW
AND DISAPPEARED.

514
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:54,159
THERE WAS MY OTHER BUDDY
FROM "HARPER", BURT REYNOLDS.

515
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:57,462
HE HASN'T MADE IT AGAIN
IN T.V. EITHER, POOR KID.

516
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,732
YOU'RE SAYING THAT
BURT REYNOLDS IS YOUR FRIEND?

517
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,601
WELL, THAT'S WHAT HE'D SAY.

518
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,136
I'M NOT SO FOND OF HIM.

519
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,804
I LIKE SALLY, SALLY FIELDS.

520
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,139
YEAH, REMEMBER HER?

521
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,473
YEAH.

522
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,210
"FLYING NUN" -- WHEN T.V. MADE
THE BIG TRANSITION

523
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:14,146
FROM BLACK AND WHITE TO COLOUR,
SHE COULDN'T CUT IT.

524
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,315
WONDER WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.

525
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,484
YOU'VE NEVER TOLD ME
YOU WERE A DIRECTOR BEFORE.

526
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,819
YEAH, AND A WRITER.

527
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,154
A WRITER?

528
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,056
ON THE SID CAESAR SHOW.

529
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:28,126
I STILL FISH WITH A COUPLE
OF THOSE OTHER WRITERS.

530
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:30,128
NEIL SIMON, WOODY ALLEN.

531
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:32,764
THEY DON'T DO T.V. EITHER
ANY MORE.

532
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:34,099
NONE OF US DO.

533
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,269
CLINT, BURT, SALLY, NEIL,
WOODY, OR ME.

534
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,938
WE STILL GO FISHING
EVERY SPRING.

535
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:44,676
YOU EVER BEEN ON THAT OLD GAME
SHOW "TO TELL THE TRUTH"?

536
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,179
HMM?

537
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,848
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME.

538
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,183
WELL...

539
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,019
HERE'S A PICTURE TAKEN
LAST SPRING.

540
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,688
NOW, HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT
FOR THAT?

541
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,524
SHE LOOKS LIKE A BIT
OF A PASTE-UP, HAP.

542
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:03,195
BURT'S HEAD IS THE SAME SIZE
AS WOODY'S WHOLE BODY.

543
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,130
THAT'S PERSPECTIVE.

544
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,132
BURT IS CLOSER.

545
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,668
HOW COME YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
IN COLOUR?

546
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,803
EVERYBODY ELSE
IS IN BLACK AND WHITE.

547
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,171
I TOLD YOU, RED.

548
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:16,275
NONE OF THEM MADE
THE BIG TRANSITION TO COLOUR.

549
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:19,711
CAN'T BE HARDER THAN
THE BIG TRANSITION TO REALITY.

550
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:27,352
RAN INTO A BIT OF A WRINKLE
WITH THE LOST-DOG FIASCO.

551
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,655
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE,
HAROLD?

552
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:30,989
A DOG.

553
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,457
A SCOTTIE DOG.

554
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:37,929
THE SCOTTIE DOG THAT HAS
A $200 REWARD ON HIS HEAD.

555
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,264
WAH-HAHH!

556
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,300
DON'T BE SO SURE
THAT'S THE DOG.

557
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,934
EVERYBODY'S FINDING THEM.

558
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,604
BUSTER HADFIELD DID,
STINKY PETERSON DID.

559
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,040
OLD MAN SEDGWICK
EVEN FOUND ONE.

560
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:50,108
THEY ALL LOOK
LIKE SCOTTIE?

561
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:53,545
EXCEPT OLD MAN SEDGWICK'S --
IT WAS A SKUNK.

562
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,280
BUT WE ALL LOSE, HAROLD.

563
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:56,748
THE REAL SCOTTIE DOG

564
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,051
RAN HOME TO HIS OWNERS,
SCARED OFF

565
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,552
BY ALL THE GUYS

566
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:03,088
WITH THE CAMP SONGS
AND MUD-WRESTLING

567
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,090
AND EXPLODING CATS AND SO ON.

568
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,458
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

569
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:09,528
HOW DO WE GET THESE DOGS
BACK TO THEIR OWNERS?

570
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:12,798
IT'S JUST ONE OWNER, HAROLD --
A SCOTTIE DOG BREEDER.

571
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,232
HE'S COMING OVER NOW.

572
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:17,002
ALL THESE DOGS
FROM ONE PLACE, HUH?

573
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:20,639
SOMEBODY HAD TO GO THERE
AND OPEN THEIR CAGES.

574
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:23,642
YEAH, WELL, MORE LIKELY--
THAT'S PROBABLY-- MAKES SENSE--

575
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,143
[possum squeal]

576
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,945
MEETING TIME -- AWAY YOU GO.

577
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,647
AWAY YOU GO -- OFF YOU GO.

578
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:32,150
UNCLE RED, I AM
SO DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

579
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,753
WELL, THEN, WE'RE EVEN.

580
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,188
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

581
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:38,290
I'M COMING HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

582
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,759
IF YOU FIND A BLACK HAIR
UNDER MY SHIRT,

583
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:42,294
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

584
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,628
IT'S JUST PUPPY LOVE.

585
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,831
THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

586
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:48,500
ON BEHALF OF HAROLD AND MYSELF
AND THE GANG,

587
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,168
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

588
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:52,170
WAVE -- YOU WAVE, TOO.

589
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:54,306
YOU WAVE --
WAVE TO THOSE PEOPLE.

590
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,941
WAVE TO THE NICE PEOPLE.

591
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:58,677
[possum squeal]

592
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:01,246
(Harold): ALL RISE, ALL RISE!

593
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:09,121
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

594
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:11,456
I JUST WANT TO KNOW...

595
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:17,496


596
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,131


597
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:20,632


598
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,134


599
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,136


600
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:27,506


601
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,214
