GET RIGHT IN AND STICK
HER ON THE SIDES

124

125

GOOD FOR YOU

132
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:58,690
BUT BECAUSE WE NEED
TO USE THE BOWL

133
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,628
AS OUR PRIMARY LENS
FOR THE TELESCOPE.

134
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:06,565

THERE WILL CATCH
ALL THE LIGHT,

135
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:08,734
FIRE IT DOWN
INSIDE THE MIXER

136
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:10,435
WHERE IT BOUNCES
AROUND ON THE DUCT TAPE

137
00:06:10,435 --> 00:06:14,339
AND THEN IT WILL COME
OUT THE HOLE THAT
I'VE DRILLED.

I'M GLAD THAT
WASN'T MY DRILL BIT.

ALL RIGHT.
NOW TO FOCUS
THE LIGHT EVEN MORE,

140
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:26,151
YOU GET ONE OF THESE
DRAIN TRAPS OUT OF

141
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:27,953
AND YOU TAKE
THE ELBOWS APART.

142
00:06:27,953 --> 00:06:30,088
AND YOU WANT
TO PUT A LITTLE
MIRROR IN EACH ELBOW.

143
00:06:30,088 --> 00:06:31,590
NOW YOU'RE SAYING
TO YOURSELF,

144
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,059
WHERE AM I GOING
TO FIND A MIRROR
THAT SMALL?

145
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:36,428
HOW ABOUT RIGHT
IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES?

146
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:38,263
STICK THAT IN,
ONE AT EACH ELBOW

147
00:06:38,263 --> 00:06:40,365
AT A 45-DEGREE ANGLE
FACING EACH OTHER

148

THE WHOLE RIG BACK
INTO THE HOLE THAT WE MADE.

00:06:46,772 --> 00:06:49,675
I WOULD WAIT UNTIL
SHE COOLED DOWN FIRST.

150
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:51,743
ALL RIGHT.

151
00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:54,413
YOU'RE ALL SET TO BE
THE PEEPING TOM OF
THE UNIVERSE.

152
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:55,914
AND THE BEAUTY OF
THE CEMENT MIXER RIG

153
00:06:55,914 --> 00:06:58,417
IS WITH ALL THE
GEARS AND LEVERS AND
THE WAY SHE'S MOUNTED HERE,

154
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:02,521
YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH
AIM IT AT WHATEVER IT
IS YOU WANT TO LOOK AT.

155
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:04,356
YOU CAN TUNE IN
MARS OR SATURN

156
00:07:04,356 --> 00:07:08,694
OR EVEN LOOK
UP YOUR URANUS.

157
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:15,634
WOW, THE MILKY WAY
IS ALL GREEN
AND LEAFY.

158
00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:19,104
WAIT A MINUTE.
OH FOR GOSH SAKES.

159
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:21,139
THERE'S A PIECE OF
DRIED SALAD ON THERE.

160
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:23,408
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN.

161
00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:28,947
WHOA.
THE SUN IS BRIGHT.

162
00:07:28,947 --> 00:07:30,349
MAN.

163
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,384
I'LL TELL YOU, THOUGH,
THE TELESCOPE WORKS GREAT,

164
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:37,456
I CAN SEE A BLACK
HOLE, EVERYWHERE.

165
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:40,192
SO REMEMBER, IF WOMEN
DON'T FIND YOU HANDSOME,

166
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:42,494
THEY SHOULD AT
LEAST FIND YOU HANDY.

167
00:07:42,494 --> 00:07:45,831
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
THIS IS MORE THAN
A TELESCOPE,

168
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:48,266
IT'S ALSO A
GREAT FIRE STARTER.

169
00:07:50,635 --> 00:07:52,104
Red Green: STAY TUNED,
BILL AND I ARE GOING

170
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,905
TO HAVE A RUN IN
OUT ON POSSUM LAKE

171
00:07:53,905 --> 00:07:56,108
AND HAROLD IS
EITHER EXCITED ABOUT
GETTING INTO THE MOVIES

172
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,477
OR INTO
THE WASHROOM.

173
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,748
I WANT TO TALK TO ANY
OF YOU GUYS WHO HAVE BEEN

174
00:08:03,748 --> 00:08:06,284
MARRIED TO THE SAME
WOMAN FOR 20 YEARS OR MORE.

175
00:08:06,284 --> 00:08:08,053
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH.

176
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:12,724
BERNICE AND I
ARE IN OUR 28TH
YEAR OF CONTROLLED BLISS.

177
00:08:12,724 --> 00:08:15,861
I KNOW IT TAKES A
LITTLE EXTRA TO KEEP
'ER GOING THAT LONG.

178
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:18,763
IT SEEMS THAT AFTER
ABOUT 20 YEARS
OF MARRIAGE,

179
00:08:18,763 --> 00:08:21,666
THE MARRIAGE TURNS
INTO KIND OF LIKE
A ROUTINE.

180
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,068
SORT OF LIKE
BEING ON A DIET,

181
00:08:23,068 --> 00:08:24,302
LOSING A WHOLE
BUNCH OF WEIGHT

182
00:08:24,302 --> 00:08:26,571
AND THEN THEY
PUT YOU ON WHAT THEY
CALL A MAINTENANCE DIET.

183
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:29,741
YEAH, A LOT OF
MARRIAGES TURN INTO A
MAINTENANCE DIET, YOU KNOW.

184
00:08:29,741 --> 00:08:32,110
YOU GOT TO HAVE
A LITTLE NIBBLE
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE

185
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,614
BUT THERE'S A GENERAL
EMBARGO ON PIGGING OUT.

186
00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:39,818
WELL, IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT THIS IS ALL
BACKWARDS,

187
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:41,253
NOW 'CAUSE WHEN
YOU'RE YOUNG

188
00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:43,255
AND AS GOOD LOOKING
AS YOU'RE GOING TO GET,

189
00:08:43,255 --> 00:08:45,624
YOU DON'T NEED ANYBODY
MAKING A FUSS OVER
YOU AT THAT TIME

190
00:08:45,624 --> 00:08:46,958
BECAUSE YOU GOT
LOTS OF ALTERNATIVES,

191
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,660
YOU CAN GET
ANYBODY YOU WANT.

192
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,161
BUT WHEN YOU'VE
GROWN A LITTLE OLDER,

193
00:08:50,161 --> 00:08:52,964
MAYBE PUT ON A COUPLE
HUNDRED POUNDS OR SO,

194
00:08:52,964 --> 00:08:57,402
AND YOUR FACE LOOKS
LIKE NOLAN RYAN'S GLOVE

195
00:08:57,402 --> 00:09:00,839
AND YOU ARE PRETTY
MUCH OUT OF ALTERNATIVES.

196
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,041
SO I SAY THE LONGER
YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED,

197
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,976
THE MORE AFFECTIONATE
YOU SHOULD BE WITH
EACH OTHER.

198
00:09:04,976 --> 00:09:07,979
GET OFF THE MAINTENANCE
DIET AND GO NUTS.

199
00:09:07,979 --> 00:09:10,815
BUT NOT ON THE
DINING ROOM TABLE.

200
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:14,085
AT LEAST NOT UNTIL
THE KIDS MOVE OUT,
ALL RIGHT?

201
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:18,123
I'M PULLING FOR
YOU 'CAUSE WE'RE
ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

202
00:09:20,925 --> 00:09:22,761
WELL, BUSTER AND STINKY
HAVE BEEN SPYING

203
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:24,529
ON THESE AMERICANS
POSING AS FISHERMEN

204
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:27,832
AND THEY ARE DEFINITELY
TRACKING UFO SPACE ALIENS.

205
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:29,000
AND HOW DO
YOU KNOW THIS?

206
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,769
DID YOU TALK
TO THEM, UNCLE RED?

207
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:32,904
OH, HAROLD, YOU
DON'T TALK TO THEM.

208
00:09:32,904 --> 00:09:34,472
THEY'LL JUST
DENY EVERYTHING

209
00:09:34,472 --> 00:09:38,076
AND THEN FORCE
YOU TO SWALLOW
THE CYANIDE CAPSULE.

210
00:09:38,076 --> 00:09:40,645
I FIGURE THESE GUYS
ARE MAYBE WITH THE CIA

211
00:09:40,645 --> 00:09:44,315
OR PERHAPS A SPECIAL
BRANCH OF THE POST OFFICE.

212
00:09:44,315 --> 00:09:47,018
EVERYTHING IS VERY,
VERY HUSH-HUSH, HAROLD.

213
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:51,022
WELL THEN WHY DON'T
ALL YOU GUYS JUST
SHUT UP ABOUT IT?

214
00:09:51,022 --> 00:09:53,958
NOTHING.
I DIDN'T -- WHAT?

215
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,593
I GOT PROOF
HERE, HAROLD.

216
00:09:55,593 --> 00:09:57,362
LOOK AT THIS PICTURE
BUSTER TOOK.

217
00:09:57,362 --> 00:09:59,397
YOU TELL ME, IS THAT
NOT AN ALIEN SPACE PAD

218
00:09:59,397 --> 00:10:01,599
LANDING SUPPORT
RIGHT THERE?

219
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,636
IT'S A TRIPOD FOR
A CAMERA, UNCLE RED.

220
00:10:04,636 --> 00:10:05,870
NO, NO, LOOK AT THAT.

221
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,939
THAT'S AN ALIEN LIFE
FORM DETECTOR IF I
EVER SAW ONE.

222
00:10:07,939 --> 00:10:11,075
NO, THAT'S
A MOVIE CAMERA.

223
00:10:11,075 --> 00:10:13,778
WELL HOW ABOUT
THIS UFO RADAR UNIT?
WHAT'S THAT THEN?

224
00:10:13,778 --> 00:10:16,714
MOVIE LIGHT.

225
00:10:16,714 --> 00:10:19,083
OH, I SEE.

226
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,251
ALL RIGHT.

227
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:23,454
THEY'RE SHOOTING FILM
FOOTAGE OF THE
SPACE ALIENS.

228
00:10:23,454 --> 00:10:25,156
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU GUYS.

229
00:10:25,156 --> 00:10:26,758
YOU LET YOUR
IMAGINATIONS RUN WILD

230
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:29,093
AND YOU
EXTRAPOLATE NOTHING
INTO SOMETHING RIDICULOUS.

231
00:10:29,093 --> 00:10:30,361
TWO GUYS SHOW UP
WITH A MOVIE CAMERA

232
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:32,297
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
THERE'S LIKE ALIENS

233
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:34,599
AND YOU'RE SPREADING
RUMOURS ABOUT UFOS.

234
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:37,802
MAYBE THEY'RE JUST
UP HERE, YOU KNOW,
SHOOTING A NATURE FILM,

235
00:10:37,802 --> 00:10:40,104
YOU KNOW, OR SHOOTING
SHOTS FOR A TV COMMERCIAL

236
00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:42,573
OR SCOUTING LOCATIONS FOR
SOME MAJOR HOLLYWOOD
PRODUCTION,

237
00:10:42,573 --> 00:10:45,176
SOME BIG BUDGET FILM THAT'S
GOING TO BE SHOOTING HERE
AT POSSUM LODGE

238
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:46,444
IN A COUPLE OF
MONTHS, YOU KNOW?

239
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:48,746
SOME $50 MILLION SPECIAL
EFFECTS EXTRAVAGANZA

240
00:10:48,746 --> 00:10:50,048
BASED ON A NUMBER
ONE BESTSELLER,

241
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:52,417
IT HAS TOM CRUISE
AND HARRISON FORD
AND JAMIE LEE CURTIS

242
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:54,218
AS MY LOVE INTEREST
AND SPECIAL SIDEKICK.

243
00:10:54,218 --> 00:10:56,421
WE'RE GOING TO
BE MOVIE STARS!

244
00:10:56,421 --> 00:10:58,890
YOU GUYS!

245
00:10:59,857 --> 00:11:01,292
HERE'S ONE.

246
00:11:01,292 --> 00:11:04,495
HOW MANY FOREST RANGERS
DOES IT TAKE TO CHANGE
A LIGHTBULB?

247
00:11:04,495 --> 00:11:06,998
JUST ONE.

248
00:11:06,998 --> 00:11:12,837
IF HE HAD A
LIGHTBULB OF COURSE.

249
00:11:12,837 --> 00:11:15,540
DO THEY STILL
HAVE LIGHTBULBS?

250
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,008
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
YOU WILL NOT FIND

251
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:18,976
A SMALL PLANE BEING
AS BIG A PART
OF HISTORY

252
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:20,978
AS IT IS IN THE
CANADIAN NORTH.

253
00:11:20,978 --> 00:11:23,247
AND SO IN A CERTAIN
WAY BUZZ SHERWOOD HERE,

254
00:11:23,247 --> 00:11:25,983
IS PART OF A LONG
AVIATION TRADITION.

255
00:11:25,983 --> 00:11:28,886
ON A WING AND A PRAYER,
THAT'S ME, RED.

256
00:11:28,886 --> 00:11:32,090
ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S
SUPPOSED TO BE
TWO WINGS.

257
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,658
YEAH, YOU GOT
TO HAVE A --

258
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:35,159
YOU GOT TO
HAVE A LOVE,

259
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:37,128
YOU GOT TO FEEL THE
ROMANCE OF FLYING, RED.

260
00:11:37,128 --> 00:11:39,130
I MEAN,
WOMEN LOVE IT.

261
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,865
THAT'S WHAT
THEY TELL ME.

262
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:42,433
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU
GOT TO BE A RISK
TAKER, RIGHT,

263
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:44,669
BECAUSE YOU KNOW
YOU GET OLD AND
COMFORTABLE LIKE YOU,

264
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:47,004
NO, THIS IS A GAME
FOR THE YOUNG KIDS

265
00:11:47,004 --> 00:11:49,540
BECAUSE US YOUNG KIDS
WE TAKE ALL THE RISK.

266
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,677
WE KNOW HOW TO BE
SELF-RELIANT WITH
WHAT'S AT HAND, YOU KNOW?

267
00:11:52,677 --> 00:11:55,179
LIKE THIS.
LOOK AT THIS
HANDY WORK, HUH?

268
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:56,948
WHAT IS THIS THING,
A WIND VANE OF SOME KIND?

269
00:11:56,948 --> 00:11:59,150
NO, IT'S A NEW
PROPELLER FOR MY PLANE.

270
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,519
SEE I FIGURE FOUR
PADDLES WILL GIVE
ME MORE LIFT

271
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,554
'CAUSE I GOT A LOT
OF DELIVERIES TO
MAKE, YOU KNOW.

272
00:12:03,554 --> 00:12:05,857
I GOT TO GET ALL THIS
STUFF UP TO A COUPLE
OF GUYS FISHING

273
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:07,859
AND THERE'S TWO MORE
MINERS UP THERE,

274
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:09,427
THEY'RE WAITING
FOR THAT BOX.

275
00:12:09,427 --> 00:12:11,696
AND THEN WHAT ELSE
HAVE WE GOT HERE?
LOOK AT THIS STUFF.

276
00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:13,998
THERE'S A MINING COMPANY
WANTS THAT FIRST AID KIT.

277
00:12:13,998 --> 00:12:16,367
I GOT SOME SMOKE
JUMPERS, NATURAL
RESOURCES,

278
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:17,835
A BOY SCOUT CREW

279
00:12:17,835 --> 00:12:19,704
AND TWO PEOPLE
UP IN TUCAHA INLET.

280
00:12:19,704 --> 00:12:21,305
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
TUCAHA INLET IS?

281
00:12:21,305 --> 00:12:22,907
JUST THIS SIDE OF
THE INLET, I BELIEVE.

282
00:12:22,907 --> 00:12:23,774
OH, WELL,
THERE YOU GO.

283
00:12:23,774 --> 00:12:25,710
AND THEN THOSE TWO
GUYS UP HERE FILMING,

284
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,345
THEY WANT SOME STUFF.

285
00:12:27,345 --> 00:12:29,413
AND I'M GOING TO
NEED EIGHT PADDLES
TO GET THIS STUFF UP.

286
00:12:29,413 --> 00:12:31,015
THE TWO GUYS FILMING
NOW, WHEN YOU WERE
FLYING THEM

287
00:12:31,015 --> 00:12:33,217
DID THEY SAY EXACTLY
WHAT IT IS THEY'RE
FILMING?

288
00:12:33,217 --> 00:12:34,885
NO, NO.

289
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:36,053
THEY JUST SPENT
THE WHOLE TIME

290
00:12:36,053 --> 00:12:39,523
TALKING INTO THE
AIR SICKNESS BAG,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

291
00:12:39,523 --> 00:12:41,792
YEAH, 'CAUSE HAROLD,
HERE THINKS THEY'RE
FROM HOLLYWOOD.

292
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:44,028
HOLLYWOOD?
REALLY HAROLD?

293
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:45,596
FAR OUT.
YEAH.

294
00:12:45,596 --> 00:12:47,698
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
THEY MIGHT NEED LIKE
SOME STUNT FLYING SHOTS

295
00:12:47,698 --> 00:12:50,368
AND THOSE GUYS MAKE
A TON OF DOUGH WHEN
YOU DO STUNT FLYING.

296
00:12:50,368 --> 00:12:53,637
WOAH, I'M OUT OF HERE.
SEE YOU LATER RED.

297
00:12:53,637 --> 00:12:55,039
YOU SEE HOW IT
WORKS KIDS,

298
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,507
IF YOU WANT TO BE
A BUSH PILOT

299
00:12:56,507 --> 00:12:57,942
ALL IT TAKES IS A
LITTLE SELF-RELIANCE,

300
00:12:57,942 --> 00:12:59,243
THE LOVE OF ROMANCE.

301
00:12:59,243 --> 00:13:04,015
A PILOT'S LICENSE
MIGHT BE A NICE TOUCH.

302
00:13:06,484 --> 00:13:09,487
BUZZ, WHAT ABOUT ALL
THE STUFF ON THE SIDES?

303
00:13:17,762 --> 00:13:20,398
WANTED, THINGY YOU PUT
ON THE END OF A DO-HICKY,

304
00:13:20,398 --> 00:13:22,266
ONE OF THE OLD ONES
THEY DON'T MAKE ANYMORE

305
00:13:22,266 --> 00:13:27,705
THAT HAS THAT WHAT'S-IT
ON THE MAIN PART,
CONTACT OCCUPANT.

306
00:13:27,705 --> 00:13:29,774
I MAY HAVE ONE OF THOSE.

307
00:13:31,308 --> 00:13:35,112
Red Green: KIND OF A
HISTORICAL THING THIS
WEEK WITH THE KAYAKING.

308
00:13:35,112 --> 00:13:37,982
OH, THERE'S BILL.

309
00:13:37,982 --> 00:13:40,518
THERE'S BILL
AND HIS KAYAK,

310
00:13:40,518 --> 00:13:42,052
SO I THOUGHT I WOULD
JUST DO THE RIGHT THING

311
00:13:42,052 --> 00:13:48,392
AND HELP HIM
INTO THE WATER.

312
00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:51,162
HE'S ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

313
00:13:51,162 --> 00:13:52,696
NOW THE THING
WITH A KAYAK IS

314
00:13:52,696 --> 00:13:55,032
IT'S A VERY
HISTORICAL VESSEL.

315
00:13:55,032 --> 00:13:56,500
LONG BEFORE
THE WHITE MAN,

316
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,937
YOU KNOW, THERE
WAS THE INUIT AND
THE ESKIMOS, WHATEVER IT IS,

317
00:13:59,937 --> 00:14:01,972
THEY HAD THE KAYAKS.

318
00:14:01,972 --> 00:14:03,274
WHAT'S THE MATTER, BILL?

319
00:14:03,274 --> 00:14:05,809
OH I THINK HE'S GOT
HIMSELF A LITTLE
WEDGED IN THERE.

320
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:07,378
IT'S HARD TO GET
INTO THE KAYAK.

321
00:14:07,378 --> 00:14:10,381
I GUESS THE INUIT WERE
A LITTLE SLIMMER THAN
THE BILLUIT.

322
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:13,150
HERE WE GO.

323
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,985
AND WE GOT HIM IN THERE.

324
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:16,287
YOU GOT TO PUT THE
FEET IN THERE FIRST,

325
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:18,722
THAT'S IT, LEAVE
THE BUTT 'TIL LATER.

326
00:14:18,722 --> 00:14:19,957
AND DO YOU
GOT THE HELMET?

327
00:14:19,957 --> 00:14:21,191
DO YOU WANT THE
HELMET ON THERE, BILL?

328
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:22,660
BILL?

329
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,094
BILL NEEDS TWO HELMETS,

330
00:14:24,094 --> 00:14:26,063
ONE TO BE
WEARING WHILE HE'S
GETTING THE OTHER HELMET.

331
00:14:26,063 --> 00:14:28,465
AND NOW HE'S --
YOU SEE THE PADDLE
THAT'S GOT THE DOUBLE END,

332
00:14:28,465 --> 00:14:32,269
THAT'S A VERY
UNIQUE DESIGN.

333
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:34,905
IT WORKS WELL TO
CLEAR THINGS OUT
OF THE WAY.

334
00:14:34,905 --> 00:14:36,407
AND OUT HE GOES
OUT INTO THE WATER.

335
00:14:36,407 --> 00:14:38,142
NOW, THE THING
WITH A KAYAK IS THEY'RE
VERY, VERY MANEUVERABLE.

336
00:14:38,142 --> 00:14:40,411
LOOK AT THIS, IT'S
LIKE A HELICOPTER
ON WATER.

337
00:14:40,411 --> 00:14:43,747
HE CAN BACK UP THERE
AND HE CAN JUST TURN
ON A DIME.

338
00:14:43,747 --> 00:14:45,182
AND YOU KNOW THE
THING TO DO,

339
00:14:45,182 --> 00:14:47,351
THEY DO WHAT THEY CALL
THE ESKIMO ROLL
WHERE THEY --

340
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:49,787
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S HALF
AN ESKIMO ROLL.

341
00:14:49,787 --> 00:14:51,221
BUT LOOK AT THE
MANEUVERABILITY.

342
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:56,694
LOOK HOW HE CAN EVEN
STEER IT AND PADDLE IT.

343
00:14:56,694 --> 00:14:58,295
LOOK AT HIM.
LOOK AT THAT.

344
00:14:58,295 --> 00:15:00,597
AND BILL LOOKED
LIKE HE WOULD BE
GOOD AT THINGS, YOU KNOW.

345
00:15:00,597 --> 00:15:04,368
WAIT.
NOW THIS DOESN'T --
THIS DOESN'T LOOK -- NO.

346
00:15:04,368 --> 00:15:07,104
IT'S STARTING TO DAWN
ON ME THAT BILL

347
00:15:07,104 --> 00:15:08,972
MAY BE HAVING A
LITTLE DIFFICULTY,

348
00:15:08,972 --> 00:15:12,276
SO I FIRE UP
THE BIG INBOARD,

349
00:15:12,276 --> 00:15:15,112
BOY SHE'S SOUNDING ROUGH,
AND OUT WE GO
TO GET HIM.

350
00:15:15,112 --> 00:15:17,347
YOU KNOW WITH THE KAYAKS,
THEY GOT THE LOW
PROFILE THERE

351
00:15:17,347 --> 00:15:18,849
AND THE BOAT SITS
UP HIGH IN THE WATER,

352
00:15:18,849 --> 00:15:20,684
YOU CAN'T ALWAYS
SEE THEM UNFORTUNATELY.

353
00:15:20,684 --> 00:15:24,188
OH, OH, OH, SORRY,
SORRY, SORRY!

354
00:15:26,356 --> 00:15:27,991
BILL?

355
00:15:27,991 --> 00:15:29,426
OH, HE'S ALL RIGHT.

356
00:15:29,426 --> 00:15:32,162
TURNED HIS
KAYAK INTO FOUR-WHEEL
DRIVE, VERY IMPRESSIVE.

357

OH, UNCLE RED, MOVIES
ARE WAY MORE BETTER
THAN TELEVISION.

TO BE TREATED FAIRLY.

461
00:20:32,962 --> 00:20:35,331

JUST GO ON
INTO THE SHOP THERE

00:20:35,331 --> 00:20:38,835
AND TELL THEM THAT
YOUR HUSBAND IS THE
