1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,573
(Beer bottle opening)

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:08,241
AHH.

3
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:11,077
IT'S "THE NEW RED GREEN SHOW".

4
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:12,879
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

5
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:14,414
WITH MY HUMBLEST APOLOGIES,

6
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:16,649
YOUR HOST, MY UNCLE, RED GREEN!

7
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:18,718
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

8
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,086
(Applause)

9
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,654
THANK YOU.

10
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:23,423
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

11
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,658
NOTHING TO APOLOGIZE FOR THERE, HAROLD.

12
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:26,893
I GOT A GREAT SHOW 
FOR YOU TODAY.

13
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:28,061
THIS IS JUST A HINT OF

14
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,129
WHAT'S COMING UP

15
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,597
IN "HANDYMAN CORNER".

16
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:32,499
INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH
DIAPERS.

17
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,101
IT'S THE "WINCHY".

18
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:36,603
IT'S IDIOT PROOF.

19
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:38,104
HERE, PROVE IT.

20
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:39,606
PUSH THE UP BUTTON.

21
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:41,107
SEE.

22
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:43,443
YOU GOT ONE OF THESE BABIES,

23
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,080
YOU CAN GET THINGS OFF
A HIGH SHELF, NO PROBLEM.

24
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,115
DON'T NEED A STEP STOOL.

25
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,451
GET CHEESIES OFF THE FRIDGE.

26
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:54,120
GET YOUR HAT OFF THE ANTLERS.

27
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,089
GET YOUR OVER-SERVED
SISTER-IN-LAW

28
00:00:56,155 --> 00:00:59,025
DOWN OFF THE CHANDELIER.

29
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:02,395
WHATEVER IT TAKES,
YOU'RE THERE.

30
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,731
ALL RIGHT, HAROLD,
LET ME DOWN.

31
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:07,567
(Explosion)

32
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:10,570
WAY TO GO, HAROLD.
YOU BLEW A FUSE.

33
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,572
YOU PUSHED THE BUTTON TOO HARD.

34
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,073
IT'S NOT A FUSE.

35
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,276
THE POWER'S OUT
ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE LAKE.

36
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,244
HERE, LOOK.

37
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:24,550
(Horns honking)

38
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,824
(Quacking)

39
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,428
(Red): TODAY, WINSTON AND I

40
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,230
WORK OUT
A MATHEMATICAL PROBLEM.

41
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,332
HAROLD IS OF NO USE
WHATSOEVER,

42
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:44,337
ALTHOUGH HE MAKES A GOOD BIRD
ON A -- YOU'LL FIND OUT.

43
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:47,473
AND I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO
SOME SOLDERING,

44
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,676
AS MY SALUTE TO HEAVY METAL.

45
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,748
YOU HAVE A NICE DAY, TOO.

46
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:58,584
I TOLD THE POWER COMPANY
WHAT I THOUGHT OF

47
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,820
THE BAD SERVICE
THEY'VE GIVEN US.

48
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:04,257
MAYBE IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO
WITH YOUR BAD CHEQUES.

49
00:02:04,323 --> 00:02:07,260
NO, IT DOESN'T --
POWER IS A C.O.D. BUSINESS.

50
00:02:07,326 --> 00:02:10,163
THEY DON'T GET MY "C"
TILL I GET THEIR "D".

51
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,998
WHEN THEY PUT THE POWER IN,

52
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,567
THEY DIDN'T ANTICIPATE
THE REQUIREMENTS

53
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,569
OF A HANDYMAN SUCH AS MYSELF.

54
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,772
I LIKE THINGS THAT HUM
WHEN YOU TURN THEM ON.

55
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,642
THEY'RE PUTTING
A TRANSFORMER TOWER

56
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:25,278
ON THE FAR SIDE OF POSSUM LAKE.

57
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:26,779
OH, GREAT.

58
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:29,215
THAT TRANSFORMER TOWER
WILL BRING IN

59
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:32,385
SO MUCH ELECTRICITY,
WE'LL BE BOUNCING CHEQUES

60
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:34,086
INTO THE NEXT MILLENIUM.

61
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:37,123
THEY'RE GOING TO
STICK IT IN POSSUM PARK,

62
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,859
BETWEEN THE BOG
AND THE GARBAGE FIRE,

63
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,395
NOW WE GOTTA WATCH
THE BOAT RACES

64
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:45,164
COWERING UNDER
THIS METAL MONSTROSITY.

65
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:46,632
GOT AN IDEA, HAROLD.

66
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:49,202
WHY DON'T WE MAKE
THE TRANSFORMER TOWER

67
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:50,703
SERVE DOUBLE DUTY?

68
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,673
NOT ONLY BRING
50,000 VOLTS INTO THE AREA,

69
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:57,743
BUT WE CAN USE IT AS
A VERTICAL GRANDSTAND.

70
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,212
A V-V-VER--
A WHAT?

71
00:02:59,278 --> 00:03:00,713
A VERTICAL GRANDSTAND.

72
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,882
PEOPLE CAN SIT ON IT, HAROLD.

73
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,383
THAT'S YOUR TROUBLE.

74
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,018
YOU GOT
NO ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT!

75
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:09,255
YOU LOOK HARD ENOUGH,
YOU'LL SEE AN OPPORTUNITY.

76
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:12,525
BUT WHY DOES IT ALWAYS HAVE
A HOOD OVER ITS HEAD

77
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,293
AND A SCYTHE IN ITS HAND?

78
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,429
(Audience laughing)

79
00:03:16,495 --> 00:03:17,930
(Red): UNBEKNOWNST TO ME,

80
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:21,167
BILL HAD HEARD ABOUT OUR IDEA
FOR THE GRANDSTAND.

81
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:23,536
SO HE GOT HIMSELF
SOME MODEL ROCKETS

82
00:03:23,602 --> 00:03:26,339
AS A WAY OF
SERVING REFRESHMENTS TO PEOPLE

83
00:03:26,405 --> 00:03:28,341
SITTING WAY UP IN THE RAFTERS.

84
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:31,410
KIND OF A HOBBY
AND A SPACE PROGRAMME COMBINED.

85
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:35,181
HE'S GOT THE WIRES
HOOKED UP TO THE ROCKET.

86
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:37,249
OH, OH, OH --
SHE'S FALLEN OVER.

87
00:03:37,316 --> 00:03:38,884
SHE'S ON AN ANGLE, BILL.

88
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:40,486
BILL, SHE'S ON AN ANGLE.

89
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,555
YEAH, YEAH --
WHAT'S THAT?

90
00:03:42,621 --> 00:03:44,223
OW!

91
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,591
THAT'S HOW THAT WORKS.

92
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,093
NOW I'M IN THE VAN

93
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,627
WITH A LIVE ROCKET.

94
00:03:48,694 --> 00:03:52,465
REMINDS ME OF A COUPLE OF DATES
I HAD IN HIGH SCHOOL.

95
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:55,267
BILL'S PROGRAMME IS
KIND OF LIKE NASA.

96
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:58,237
WELL, NOT QUITE THE SAME,
BUT IT RHYMES.

97
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,239
WHAT'S HE DOING?

98
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:03,042
STAND BACK, STAND BACK,
STAND BACK, STAND BACK!

99
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:04,810
STAND BACK, STAND BACK!

100
00:04:05,811 --> 00:04:07,246
ALL CLEAR.

101
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,948
BILL WILL BE BACK LATER

102
00:04:09,014 --> 00:04:12,585
WITH A COUPLE MORE ROCKETS
AND A LOT MORE TROUBLE.

103
00:04:12,651 --> 00:04:14,753
HERE WE ARE WITH
HAP SHAUGHNESSY.

104
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,156
WE'RE ALL SET TO PLAY
OUR WORD GAME.

105
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:18,757
WHAT'S OUR PRIZE TODAY?

106
00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:21,594
RED, THE GRAND PRIZE IS
A PAIR OF EARFLAPS

107
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,762
FROM RAYMOND'S HOUSE OF RUBBER.

108
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:25,264
CERTAINLY A GOOD PRIZE.

109
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,032
HAROLD, GIVE ME THE WORD.

110
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:28,767
DON'T LOOK AT THIS, HAP.

111
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:32,271
I'LL TELL THE PEOPLE AT HOME
WHAT IT SAYS.

112
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:35,774
ALL RIGHT, I GOT 30 SECONDS
TO GET YOU TO SAY THIS.

113
00:04:35,841 --> 00:04:37,776
SOMEBODY WHO MAKES UP STORIES.

114
00:04:37,843 --> 00:04:39,278
AUTHOR.

115
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,779
ERNEST HEMINGWAY AND I--

116
00:04:40,846 --> 00:04:42,681
NO, NO, THAT WASN'T IT.

117
00:04:42,748 --> 00:04:45,217
SOMEONE WHO TELLS FALSEHOODS.

118
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:46,719
POLITICIAN.

119
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:49,722
WHEN I WAS CHARLES De GAULLE'S
BODYGUARD--

120
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:51,223
AGAIN, NO, NO.

121
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,726
A PERSON WHO BENDS THE TRUTH.

122
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:55,227
SECRET AGENT.

123
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:57,229
I WAS DOWN IN ALGERIA--

124
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:58,731
NO, NO, HAP.

125
00:04:58,797 --> 00:05:00,232
I THINK I GOT IT.

126
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:02,234
HAP SHAUGHNESSY,
YOU ARE A...

127
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:04,737
DEEP SEA DIVER, ASTRONAUT.

128
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:06,739
NO.                     SUMO
WRESTLER.

129
00:05:06,805 --> 00:05:08,240
INVENTOR.

130
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:11,010
INVENTOR, YES,
'CAUSE YOU INVENT STORIES,

131
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:12,578
SO THAT MAKES YOU A...

132
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,079
BROADWAY PLAYWRIGHT.

133
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:17,249
I HAVEN'T WRITTEN A HIT MUSICAL
IN YEARS.

134
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:20,285
SAY SOMEBODY SAYS THAT
YOU NEVER WERE AN ASTRONAUT

135
00:05:20,352 --> 00:05:22,254
A SUMO WRESTLER
OR A PLAYWRIGHT.

136
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:23,756
THAT PERSON IS A...

137
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:25,224
A LIAR.

138
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,760
THERE YOU GO.

139
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:29,762
YOU GOT IT.

140
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:31,263
YEAH.

141
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,066
WELL... DO YOU KNOW,
THE WORST LIAR I EVER MET?

142
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,601
NO.

143
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,770
MICHELLE PFIEFFER.

144
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:40,773
SHE SWORE THAT
SHE WOULDN'T FALL FOR ME.

145
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:44,576
SAID IT WAS ONLY GOING TO BE
A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP.

146
00:05:44,643 --> 00:05:46,912
BUT, OH NO.

147
00:05:46,912 --> 00:05:47,979
(Strums acoustic guitar)

148
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:50,983
OH, FRUIT, FRUIT,
FRUIT, FRUIT, FRUIT

149
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:53,252
NATURE'S WAY
OF MAKING THINGS SCOOT

150
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:55,254
FUN TO EAT
AND FUN TO THROW

151
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,322
BUT IF YOU TOSS 'EM,
HERE'S SOMETHING TO KNOW

152
00:05:57,389 --> 00:05:59,057
I HAD AN EXPERIENCE
DOWN BY THE BEACH

153
00:05:59,124 --> 00:06:00,726
I NAILED A GUY
WITH A ROTTEN PEACH

154
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,194
HE WAS A FULL-FIGURED MAN,
HE COULD REALLY HIT

155
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,963
SO IF YOU'RE PREDISPOSED
TO THROWING PEACHES

156
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,801
I WOULD MAKE SURE THAT YOU
FIRST OF ALL REMOVE THE PIT

157
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:11,970
IT'S MY IDEA TO BUILD
THIS VERTICAL GRANDSTAND.

158
00:06:12,037 --> 00:06:14,406
WE'LL ATTACH
ALUMINUM LAWN CHAIRS TO

159
00:06:14,473 --> 00:06:16,241
THE STEEL TRANSMISSION TOWER.

160
00:06:16,308 --> 00:06:18,977
I THOUGHT I'D TAKE THIS
"HANDYMAN CORNER"

161
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:21,680
AND SHOW YOU HOW TO BOND
METAL TO METAL.

162
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:24,650
IMAGINE THAT THIS IS
THE TRANSMISSION TOWER.

163
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:27,119
IMAGINE THAT THIS
IS A LAWN CHAIR.

164
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:30,956
I'M GOING TO START UP
ONE OF THESE SOLDERING TORCHES.

165
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:34,459
WE'RE GOING TO SOLDER
THIS WHOLE THING TOGETHER.

166
00:06:34,526 --> 00:06:36,261
SOLDER'S A STRANGE WORD.

167
00:06:36,328 --> 00:06:38,430
YOU DON'T PRONOUNCE THE "L".

168
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:40,265
IF YOU SAY "SOLLLDER"

169
00:06:40,332 --> 00:06:43,702
THE CLERKS ARE GOING TO
STAY AWAY IN DROVES.

170
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:45,771
YOU GET A WORD LIKE "HELP",

171
00:06:45,837 --> 00:06:48,206
YOU WANT TO PRONOUNCE
THE "L".

172
00:06:48,273 --> 00:06:49,207
HEP, HEP.

173
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:50,709
SEE, NOBODY COMES.

174
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:53,011
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS

175
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:54,546
HEAT UP THE METAL.

176
00:06:54,613 --> 00:06:56,481
GET THEM BOTH GOOD AND HOT.

177
00:06:56,548 --> 00:07:00,652
I RECOMMEND YOU USE A TORCH,
BUT YOU COULD USE A STOVE OR,

178
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:04,222
IF YOU'RE REAL FAST,
YOU COULD USE AN EXPLOSION.

179
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:05,991
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S GOOD.

180
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:08,226
NOW YOU GET SOME OF
THIS FLUX.

181
00:07:08,293 --> 00:07:09,928
YOU WANT TO PUT THAT ON.

182
00:07:09,995 --> 00:07:11,964
IT KIND OF CLEANS THE THING.

183
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,233
YOU CAN JUST PUT IT ON
WITH YOUR FINGERS...

184
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,402
BUT I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT.

185
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:20,138
ALL RIGHT NOW,
JUST GET YOUR SOLDER,

186
00:07:20,205 --> 00:07:22,441
AND YOU WANT TO HEAT THAT UP.

187
00:07:22,507 --> 00:07:26,011
PUT ENOUGH SOLDER IN THERE
THAT THE METALS BECOME ONE,

188
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,512
ALL JOINED TOGETHER.

189
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:29,381
AND DON'T BE SHY.

190
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:32,584
JUST LAY THE SOLDER IN THERE.

191
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:36,955
THERE, THAT OUGHT TO HOLD HER.

192
00:07:37,022 --> 00:07:40,492
HEP, HEP,
I'M COVERED IN "SOLLLDER."

193
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:42,928
SEE, NOBODY COMES.

194
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:44,896
SOLDER'S NOT ALL THAT STRONG.

195
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:47,099
BUT IF YOU SOCK
ENOUGH ON THERE,

196
00:07:47,165 --> 00:07:48,400
SHE OUGHT TO HOLD.

197
00:07:50,335 --> 00:07:54,806
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL HAVE TO GO TO
SOMETHING STRONGER THAN SOLDER.

198
00:07:54,873 --> 00:07:57,442
I'LL JUST GET THIS STUFF
OFF MYSELF,

199
00:07:57,509 --> 00:07:59,177
AND I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

200
00:07:59,244 --> 00:08:01,913
MAN, I FEEL LIKE
A BAKED POTATO.

201
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,417
THIS IS CALLED BRAZING
'CAUSE YOU DO IT WITH BRASS.

202
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:08,920
IF YOU DID IT WITH COPPER,
YOU'D CALL IT "CRAZING".

203
00:08:08,987 --> 00:08:11,189
IF YOU DID IT WITH
NITROGLYCERINE,

204
00:08:11,256 --> 00:08:12,724
CALL AN AMBULANCE.

205
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:16,528
ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS ADD
THE OXYGEN TO THE FLAME

206
00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:19,231
AND YOU CAN GET HER
PRETTY DARN HOT.

207
00:08:19,297 --> 00:08:20,732
I DON'T HAVE BRASS.

208
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:22,234
THAT'S EXPENSIVE.

209
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,236
I'LL TO USE A COAT HANGER.

210
00:08:24,302 --> 00:08:25,704
IT SHOULD BE OK.

211
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,739
YOU JUST GET THIS SO HOT...

212
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:30,242
YOU DON'T NEED ANY FLUX
WITH THIS.

213
00:08:30,308 --> 00:08:32,744
JUST LAY THE BRASS
RIGHT IN THERE,

214
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:34,246
OR THE COAT HANGER.

215
00:08:34,312 --> 00:08:36,514
THE BEAUTY OF THIS IS
IT'S SO HOT

216
00:08:36,581 --> 00:08:39,484
YOU CAN USE IT FOR CUTTING
METAL PIPES OR

217
00:08:39,551 --> 00:08:42,254
METAL PLATES
OR METAL GIRDERS EVEN.

218
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:45,991
OR THAT.

219
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:47,192
WE'RE GETTING SERIOUS.

220
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:50,128
THIS IS WHAT THEY CALL
AN ARC WELDER,

221
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:53,598
WHICH IS SORT OF LIKE
CONTROLLED LIGHTNING,

222
00:08:53,665 --> 00:08:57,569
EXCEPT THIS BABY STRIKES TWICE
IN THE SAME PLACE.

223
00:08:57,636 --> 00:09:00,071
COME TO THINK OF IT,
I'VE SEEN WELDERS

224
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:02,607
STRIKE IN THE SAME PLACE
FOR 30 YEARS.

225
00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:04,109
TAKE A CLIP LIKE THIS.

226
00:09:04,175 --> 00:09:05,810
CLIP THAT ONTO YOUR WORK.

227
00:09:05,877 --> 00:09:08,279
THAT'S SORT OF LIKE
YOUR GROUND WIRE.

228
00:09:08,346 --> 00:09:11,616
THEN THE OTHER UNIT,
KIND OF AN ODD-LOOKING THING,

229
00:09:11,683 --> 00:09:14,185
TAKE THAT AND STICK THE ROD
IN THE END.

230
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:15,720
YOU DON'T USE A FLAME.

231
00:09:15,787 --> 00:09:17,555
THIS ROD TOUCHES THE WORK.

232
00:09:17,622 --> 00:09:21,226
THAT CLOSES THE CIRCUIT,
AND THAT DOES YOUR WELDING.

233
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:23,728
SHE'S BRIGHT
AND CAN HURT YOUR EYES.

234
00:09:23,795 --> 00:09:25,730
SO, FOR SAFETY'S SAKE,

235
00:09:25,797 --> 00:09:28,066
AND YOU KNOW ME,
SAFETY FORCED,

236
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:30,402
WE'RE GOING TO PUT
THE MASK ON

237
00:09:30,468 --> 00:09:31,903
OH, BOY.

238
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,739
WAIT A MINUTE HERE.

239
00:09:34,806 --> 00:09:36,241
WOW.

240
00:09:36,307 --> 00:09:38,076
BETTER HANG ON TO THE...

241
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:40,745
(Groaning)

242
00:09:40,812 --> 00:09:42,247
ALL RIGHT, NOW.

243
00:09:42,313 --> 00:09:44,783
YOU CAN'T ALWAYS SEE
WHEN YOU DO THIS.

244
00:09:44,849 --> 00:09:47,385
BUT YOU JUST TOUCH THE ROD
TO THE WORK,

245
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:50,822
AND THE SPARK WILL
LET YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

246
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:04,435
THERE WE GO.

247
00:10:04,502 --> 00:10:06,437
SOLID AS A ROCK.

248
00:10:06,504 --> 00:10:08,439
(Audience laughing)

249
00:10:08,506 --> 00:10:12,277
ALL RIGHT, I MAY HAVE WELDED
SOME OF MY TOOLS

250
00:10:12,343 --> 00:10:15,280
AND VARIOUS WORKSHOP
COLLECTABLES TO THE UNIT.

251
00:10:15,346 --> 00:10:17,215
BUT, LOOK AT THE BRIGHT SIDE.

252
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:19,784
I NOW HAVE
A BURGLAR-PROOF ENVIRONMENT.

253
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:22,186
I'VE ALSO WELDED
MY WEDDING RING

254
00:10:22,253 --> 00:10:25,456
TO MY BELT BUCKLE,
WHICH IS KIND OF POETIC.

255
00:10:25,523 --> 00:10:28,960
SO, REMEMBER, IF WOMEN DON'T
FIND YOU HANDSOME,

256
00:10:29,027 --> 00:10:31,963
THEY SHOULD AT LEAST
FIND YOU HANDY.

257
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,867
EVERYBODY ENJOYS SEEING A GUY
BEING CHASED BY A MOOSE.

258
00:10:40,872 --> 00:10:43,074
GARTH HARBLE HERE,
ANIMAL CONTROL.

259
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:46,744
WHAT HAPPENED? -- YOU STAND
TOO CLOSE TO THE DART TEAM?

260
00:10:46,811 --> 00:10:48,212
I WISH.

261
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:50,315
I WAS PECKED BY SEAGULLS.

262
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:53,751
THAT IS IT FOR ME
AND OUTDOOR RESTAURANTS.

263
00:10:53,818 --> 00:10:55,753
DO YOU HAVE
A FEATURE FOR US?

264
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,255
HMM?

265
00:10:57,322 --> 00:10:58,756
A FEATURE.

266
00:10:58,823 --> 00:11:00,258
OH, YES, YES, YES.

267
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:03,828
TODAY WE'LL TALK ABOUT
HOW TO GET RID OF SOMETHING

268
00:11:03,895 --> 00:11:06,731
A BIT LARGER THAN
WE USUALLY TALK ABOUT.

269
00:11:06,798 --> 00:11:08,266
A MOOSE.

270
00:11:08,332 --> 00:11:10,268
SURE -- WITH A SHOTGUN.

271
00:11:10,334 --> 00:11:13,271
I'LL PRETEND
I DIDN'T HEAR THAT, RED.

272
00:11:13,337 --> 00:11:14,772
NO!

273
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:16,274
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO --

274
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,577
SAY YOU GOT A MOOSE
HANGING AROUND YOUR HOUSE.

275
00:11:19,644 --> 00:11:21,079
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS

276
00:11:21,145 --> 00:11:23,281
GET YOURSELF A CAN OF
MOOSE MUSK.

277
00:11:23,347 --> 00:11:24,715
MOOSE MUSK.

278
00:11:24,782 --> 00:11:29,620
TO A MALE MOOSE,
THIS IS UM... VERY PLEASANT,

279
00:11:29,687 --> 00:11:32,723
VERY, UM... WELL,
IT'S VERY ATTRACTIVE.

280
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,226
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

281
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:37,195
NOW, TAKE THE MOOSE MUSK.

282
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:40,164
YOU TAKE IT DEEP,
DEEP INTO THE WOODS,

283
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:42,733
AND YOU TAKE THE TOP OFF.

284
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,002
OH BOY, LOOK AT THAT, HUH?

285
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:49,540
NOW, THIS WILL ATTRACT
THE MOOSE DEEP INTO THE WOODS.

286
00:11:49,607 --> 00:11:53,644
BOY, THAT'S A HECK OF A LOT
OF MOOSE MUSK THERE.

287
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:57,615
THERE'S ENOUGH HORMONES THERE
TO START A LIFT BRIDGE.

288
00:11:57,682 --> 00:12:01,485
OF COURSE, YOU DON'T NEED
TO USE NEAR THIS AMOUNT.

289
00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:03,588
A TINY LITTLE BIT WILL DO.

290
00:12:03,654 --> 00:12:07,225
THAT MUCH MOOSE MUSK,
THAT WILL PROBABLY ATTRACT--

291
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,926
LOOKS LIKE 25 TO 30.

292
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:11,028
I'D SAY AT LEAST 25 TO 30.

293
00:12:11,095 --> 00:12:15,766
THAT MUCH MOOSE MUSK WILL DRIVE
A MOOSE ABSOLUTELY CRAZY.

294
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,768
SENSORY OVERLOAD.

295
00:12:17,835 --> 00:12:19,437
OH BOY.

296
00:12:19,503 --> 00:12:21,272
ANOTHER SUPER DAY.

297
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:22,840
RUN, HAROLD!

298
00:12:25,776 --> 00:12:28,879
DON'T YOU PASS ME, HAROLD!

299
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:33,718
MAN, THIS THING BINDS.

300
00:12:33,784 --> 00:12:35,720
(Audience laughing)

301
00:12:35,786 --> 00:12:38,723
THE BEST WAY TO MAKE
MY VERTICAL GRANDSTAND

302
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:42,560
AFFORDABLE TO EVERYBODY
IS TO HAVE THREE TICKET PRICES.

303
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:44,829
LIKE REDS, GOLDS AND BLUES?

304
00:12:44,895 --> 00:12:47,131
YEAH, SORT OF --
POP, WINE AND BEER.

305
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:49,133
NOW, THE POP TICKET

306
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,735
IS 10 BUCKS.

307
00:12:50,801 --> 00:12:52,803
YOU GET UP 10 FEET
ON A PLANK.

308
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,072
THE WINE TICKET,
THAT'S 20 BUCKS.

309
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:56,640
YOU'RE 30 FEET HIGHER

310
00:12:56,707 --> 00:12:59,243
IN A LAWN CHAIR
WITH A ROPE SEAT-BELT.

311
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,747
I GOT ABOUT 40 ALREADY
DUCK-TAPED UP THERE.

312
00:13:02,813 --> 00:13:04,849
BEER TICKETS BEING THE BEST.

313
00:13:04,915 --> 00:13:07,952
HAROLD, BEER TICKETS
ARE ALWAYS THE BEST.

314
00:13:08,018 --> 00:13:10,588
GARTH HARBLE HERE,
ANIMAL CONTROL,

315
00:13:10,654 --> 00:13:14,759
REMINDING YOU, DON'T FEED BEARS
WHEN THEY'RE IN HEAT.

316
00:13:14,825 --> 00:13:17,328
AND, OF COURSE, VICE VERSA.

317
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:22,066
WELCOME TO
THE EXPERT PORTION OF THE SHOW.

318
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:24,435
THIS WEEK WE HAVE MY UNCLE RED

319
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:27,171
AND HIS FRIEND,
WINSTON ROTHSCHILD.

320
00:13:27,238 --> 00:13:30,508
(Applause and cheering)

321
00:13:30,574 --> 00:13:32,009
OK.

322
00:13:32,076 --> 00:13:34,745
THE FIRST LETTER
GOES AS FOLLOWS:

323
00:13:34,812 --> 00:13:36,247
"DEAR EXPERTS...

324
00:13:36,313 --> 00:13:39,850
"MY GUIDANCE COUNSELLOR
SAYS THAT THE AVERAGE PERSON

325
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:43,220
"WILL HOLD DOWN FIVE
OR SIX JOBS IN THEIR LIFE.

326
00:13:43,287 --> 00:13:45,723
"DOES THAT SOUND RIGHT TO YOU?"

327
00:13:45,789 --> 00:13:49,660
YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
I DON'T LOOK AT IT THAT WAY.

328
00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:54,565
I LOOK AT IT AS FILLING YOUR
LIFE WITH PROFITABLE ACTIVITY.

329
00:13:54,632 --> 00:13:56,600
AS THE GREAT ANTHONY ANTHONY
ONCE SAID,

330
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:58,369
"IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
SELF-HELP,

331
00:13:58,435 --> 00:14:00,037
"YOU'VE GOT TO HELP YOURSELF."

332
00:14:00,104 --> 00:14:04,642
WELL WORTH 90 BUCKS
FOR THAT TIDBIT, I WOULD THINK.

333
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,110
I THINK HE MEANT THAT

334
00:14:06,176 --> 00:14:10,014
YOU ADD UP THE HOURS IN A DAY
THAT YOU COULD BE WORKING.

335
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,316
SO WHAT IS THAT -- 20?

336
00:14:12,383 --> 00:14:14,184
(Red): 20?

337
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:16,520
SOMETHING'S OUT OF WHACK THERE,

338
00:14:16,587 --> 00:14:19,223
EITHER YOUR MATH
OR YOUR PRIORITIES.

339
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,859
YOU MULTIPLY THAT
BY THE NUMBER OF YEARS

340
00:14:21,926 --> 00:14:24,929
FROM WHEN YOU LEFT SCHOOL
TILL WHEN YOU RETIRE.

341
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:27,898
SO HOW OLD WERE YOU
WHEN YOU LEFT SCHOOL?

342
00:14:27,965 --> 00:14:30,000
20.

343
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:32,770
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WENT PASSED
HIGH SCHOOL.

344
00:14:32,836 --> 00:14:35,239
I PASSED IT
ON THE WAY TO THE LODGE.

345
00:14:37,274 --> 00:14:38,709
OK, SO THAT'S --

346
00:14:38,776 --> 00:14:43,147
SO 45 YEARS TIMES
20 HOURS A DAY...

347
00:14:43,213 --> 00:14:44,782
THAT'S...

348
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,458
A LOT OF TIME!

349
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:55,959
EASILY A LOT.

350
00:14:56,026 --> 00:14:57,795
THAT'S WHAT
I THOUGHT.

351
00:14:57,861 --> 00:15:00,130
AND SEE,
YOU COULD BE MAKING MONEY

352
00:15:00,197 --> 00:15:01,732
WITH THAT TIME.

353
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:03,767
OH YEAH.

354
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:05,269
TAKE ME, FOR INSTANCE.

355
00:15:05,335 --> 00:15:07,304
I AM RUNNING A VERY SUCCESSFUL

356
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:09,640
SEWAGE AND SEPTIC SUCKING
BUSINESS.

357
00:15:09,706 --> 00:15:11,842
AND
I HAVE SOMETHING ON THE SIDE.

358
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:14,678
YOU MIGHT WANT TO SEE
A DOCTOR ABOUT THAT.

359
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:16,947
(Audience laughing)

360
00:15:19,817 --> 00:15:23,187
YOU SEE... RED,
THE WAY I SEE IT IS

361
00:15:23,253 --> 00:15:25,222
I'M IN THAT TRUCK
ALL DAY LONG.

362
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:28,725
I COULD DO MORE THAN SIMPLY
SUCK OUT SEPTIC TANKS.

363
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:30,694
I SUPPOSE,
YEAH.

364
00:15:30,761 --> 00:15:34,164
SO, I'VE NOW GOT
A PIZZA DELIVERY SERVICE.

365
00:15:34,231 --> 00:15:36,099
(Audience laughing)

366
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:39,069
AND,

367
00:15:39,136 --> 00:15:43,207
A TAXI SERVICE,
AND A COURIER SERVICE.

368
00:15:43,273 --> 00:15:46,977
"IF IT'S NOT ON YOUR DESK
BY 8:00 TOMORROW MORNING,

369
00:15:47,044 --> 00:15:48,846
"IT'S FREE, GUARANTEED."

370
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:52,115
A LOT OF COURIER COMPANIES
CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT.

371
00:15:52,182 --> 00:15:54,585
THAT'S MY PIZZA DELIVERY
GUARANTEE.

372
00:15:54,651 --> 00:15:56,653
(Audience laughing)

373
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,088
HERE'S A HANDYMAN HINT.

374
00:15:58,155 --> 00:16:00,123
WHEN YOU'VE GOT
A PIECE OF WOOD

375
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,326
THAT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT
TOO LONG,

376
00:16:02,392 --> 00:16:05,796
YOU CAN SHORTEN IT USING
ONE OF THESE WOOD PLANES.

377
00:16:08,298 --> 00:16:10,033
MAKES IT SMOOTHER, TOO.

378
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,303
REMEMBER, ANY TOOL
CAN BE THE RIGHT TOOL.

379
00:16:15,906 --> 00:16:17,407
AS PREVIOUSLY WARNED,

380
00:16:17,474 --> 00:16:20,911
BILL IS GOING TO BE
FOOLING AROUND WITH ROCKETS.

381
00:16:20,978 --> 00:16:22,546
I'LL BE HIS ASSISTANT.

382
00:16:22,613 --> 00:16:25,415
MANY TIMES A SCIENTIST
HAS AN ASSISTANT.

383
00:16:25,482 --> 00:16:26,917
I'LL DO WHAT

384
00:16:26,984 --> 00:16:28,819
ANY SANE ASSISTANT WOULD DO,

385
00:16:28,885 --> 00:16:30,654
BASICALLY GET OUT OF THERE.

386
00:16:30,721 --> 00:16:32,289
BILL'S GOT HER WIRED UP.

387
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:35,826
YOU CAN IGNITE THESE ALMOST
LIKE AN EXPLOSIVE CHARGE.

388
00:16:35,892 --> 00:16:38,228
THERE'S AN ELECTRICAL UNIT
IN THERE.

389
00:16:38,295 --> 00:16:39,763
WHEN YOU PLUNGE DOWN,

390
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,399
THE ELECTRICITY
GOES THROUGH THE WIRE.

391
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:45,702
IT EVEN GOES THROUGH
WHEN YOU PULL UP ON THAT.

392
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:47,771
"THERE YOU GO, BILL.

393
00:16:47,838 --> 00:16:49,272
"YOU'RE WELCOME."

394
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:50,974
BILL HOOKS THAT UP.

395
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:54,778
NONE OF US NOTICED
THAT THERE WAS CLOTHING,

396
00:16:54,845 --> 00:16:57,748
I THINK THE SCIENTIST
LET US DOWN.

397
00:16:57,814 --> 00:16:59,983
AND THIS WAS... THIS WAS...

398
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,853
THIS WAS AN UNFORTUNATE
TURN OF EVENTS.

399
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,654
BUT, ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

400
00:17:04,721 --> 00:17:06,857
THESE ARE
THE HOT NEW FASHIONS

401
00:17:06,923 --> 00:17:08,358
OUT OF POSSUM LODGE.

402
00:17:08,425 --> 00:17:10,060
BILL'S GOT A BIGGER...

403
00:17:10,127 --> 00:17:13,430
I'M DOING THE ASSISTANT THING
TO THE "T" NOW.

404
00:17:13,497 --> 00:17:14,931
CLEAR THE AREA.

405
00:17:14,998 --> 00:17:16,566
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.

406
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:19,669
THE CURIOSITY, SEE --
CAN'T HELP BUT LOOK.

407
00:17:19,736 --> 00:17:23,006
BILL DID NOT TELL ME
EXACTLY WHAT HE HAD IN MIND.

408
00:17:23,073 --> 00:17:26,476
SO WHEN THE ROCKET
HOOKED AROUND HIS ANKLE,

409
00:17:26,543 --> 00:17:29,146
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHETHER TO MENTION IT.

410
00:17:29,212 --> 00:17:31,147
PLUS, I HADN'T NOTICED IT.

411
00:17:31,214 --> 00:17:34,451
THIS WAS UNFORTUNATE,
BECAUSE AS HE LAY DOWN,

412
00:17:34,518 --> 00:17:37,787
AND WITH HIM JUXTAPOSING
HIS LEGS AROUND,

413
00:17:37,854 --> 00:17:39,256
HE PUT THE ROCKET

414
00:17:39,322 --> 00:17:41,391
IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE PLACE,

415
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:45,128
AND THEN REALLY KIND OF
WEDGING IT IN THERE.

416
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:47,731
I DON'T WHETHER
THIS IS HIS PLAN,

417
00:17:47,797 --> 00:17:49,366
OR THIS IS GOING WRONG.

418
00:17:49,432 --> 00:17:50,967
IS THIS WHAT HE WANTS,

419
00:17:51,034 --> 00:17:52,702
OR IS THIS A MISTAKE?

420
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:56,239
I'M THINKING IT'S A MISTAKE
AT THIS POINT.

421
00:17:56,306 --> 00:18:00,443
NOW I REALIZE, THIS IS
NOTHING TO DO WITH ROCKETS.

422
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,914
THIS IS PART OF BILL'S
AEROBIC EXERCISE PROGRAMME.

423
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,749
HE LOOKS PRETTY AIRED OUT.

424
00:18:05,815 --> 00:18:08,218
THOSE CRAMPS WILL GO AWAY
IN AWHILE,

425
00:18:08,285 --> 00:18:10,620
BUT YOU'LL NEVER GO BACK
TO NORMAL.

426
00:18:10,687 --> 00:18:12,155
STAY TUNED

427
00:18:12,222 --> 00:18:13,757
WHILE HAROLD DROPS IN.

428
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:21,698
THE WEATHER'S PERFECT
FOR THE BOAT RACE.

429
00:18:21,765 --> 00:18:24,000
TICKETS HAVE BEEN SELLING
LIKE MAD.

430
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:26,770
HAROLD HAS AGREED TO OPERATE
THE CONCESSION STAND.

431
00:18:26,836 --> 00:18:28,304
RIGHT, HAROLD?

432
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,442
AHH HA HA.

433
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:33,910
AHH.

434
00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:35,445
HA HA HA HA.

435
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:37,714
NOW I KNOW WHY WOMEN
WERE SO HAPPY

436
00:18:37,781 --> 00:18:39,783
WHEN THEY INVENTED PANTYHOSE.

437
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:42,786
YOU'D THINK MY UNCLE WOULD
GIVE ME A TICKET.

438
00:18:42,852 --> 00:18:44,554
YOU'RE GETTING IN FREE.

439
00:18:44,621 --> 00:18:47,557
I JUST ATTACHED
A FEW CONDITIONS TO IT.

440
00:18:47,624 --> 00:18:49,325
WHERE YOU GOING TO BE?

441
00:18:49,392 --> 00:18:51,294
OFF COUNTING YOUR MONEY?

442
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:54,164
NO -- AS MANAGER OF
THE VERTICAL GRANDSTAND,

443
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,965
I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY RIGHT

444
00:18:56,032 --> 00:18:58,835
THAT I TAKE THE BOX OFF
MY OLD PICK-UP TRUCK

445
00:18:58,902 --> 00:19:01,304
AND WELD THAT TO
THE TOP OF THE TOWER.

446
00:19:01,371 --> 00:19:03,139
YOUR OWN PRIVATE BOX?!

447
00:19:03,206 --> 00:19:04,641
YOU HAVEN'T LIVED

448
00:19:04,707 --> 00:19:09,212
TILL YOU'VE EXPERIENCED
A BOAT RACE FROM 130 FEET.

449
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:12,148
MEANWHILE, I'LL BE DANGLING
FROM THIS CABLE

450
00:19:12,215 --> 00:19:14,984
LOOKING LIKE SPIDERMAN
ON A COFFEE BREAK.

451
00:19:15,051 --> 00:19:17,821
I WAS THINKING MORE
DOPE ON A ROPE.

452
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,056
AHHH!

453
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:23,493
NOW YOU'VE GONE AND DONE IT.

454
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,361
YOU'VE SAID THE ONE THING

455
00:19:25,428 --> 00:19:27,831
THAT ALWAYS GETS MEN
INTO TROUBLE.

456
00:19:27,897 --> 00:19:29,866
YOU HAD TO BE A BIG SHOT.

457
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:32,368
DOING THAT JOB
AROUND THE HOUSE.

458
00:19:32,435 --> 00:19:34,837
SHE KINDLY OFFERS SOME ADVICE.

459
00:19:34,904 --> 00:19:39,342
AND YOU SAID,
"I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING."

460
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:40,843
YOU LIED.

461
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,846
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

462
00:19:43,913 --> 00:19:46,416
MEN NEVER KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

463
00:19:46,482 --> 00:19:48,384
WHY DRAW ATTENTION TO IT?

464
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:51,354
SHE'S ONLY GOING TO
CHECK UP ON YOU.

465
00:19:51,421 --> 00:19:53,856
OK, GET YOURSELF
ALONE IN THERE.

466
00:19:53,923 --> 00:19:55,358
NO WITNESSES AROUND.

467
00:19:55,425 --> 00:19:57,894
IF THERE'S ANY INSTRUCTIONS,
READ 'EM.

468
00:19:57,961 --> 00:20:00,229
I KNOW YOU
DON'T READ INSTRUCTIONS,

469
00:20:00,296 --> 00:20:03,366
BUT THERE'S JUST NO ROOM
FOR ERROR THIS TIME.

470
00:20:03,433 --> 00:20:08,037
IF YOU'VE GOT NO INSTRUCTIONS,
YOU CAN HIRE A PROFESSIONAL.

471
00:20:08,104 --> 00:20:10,340
BUT WHAT GOOD WOULD THAT DO?

472
00:20:10,406 --> 00:20:12,675
IT'S ONLY GOING TO
BLOW YOUR COVER.

473
00:20:12,742 --> 00:20:15,812
IF YOU'RE REALLY STUCK,
YOU GOTTA CALL HER DAD

474
00:20:15,878 --> 00:20:18,314
AND ASK HIM TO COME OVER
AND HELP YA.

475
00:20:18,381 --> 00:20:19,816
(Audience laughing)

476
00:20:19,882 --> 00:20:23,820
THE MOST USELESS
HUMAN BEING ON THE PLANET.

477
00:20:23,886 --> 00:20:26,322
(Audience laughing)

478
00:20:26,389 --> 00:20:28,191
HE WON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

479
00:20:28,257 --> 00:20:31,327
BUT HE'LL DO ANYTHING
FOR HIS LITTLE GIRL.

480
00:20:31,394 --> 00:20:34,330
HE'LL PROBABLY WRECK
EVERYTHING IN THE PROCESS.

481
00:20:34,397 --> 00:20:36,833
EXACTLY WHAT
YOU WANT HIM TO DO.

482
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:39,836
HE CAN TAKE
THE HEAT FOR MESSING UP.

483
00:20:39,902 --> 00:20:43,840
YOU CAN TAKE THE GLORY FOR
ADMITTING THAT YOU NEEDED HELP.

484
00:20:43,906 --> 00:20:45,374
SHE'LL LOVE YOU FOR IT!

485
00:20:45,441 --> 00:20:47,944
REMEMBER, DO EXACTLY
WHAT WE SAID HERE.

486
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,413
TRUST US --
WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING.

487
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,348
(Audience laughing)

488
00:20:52,415 --> 00:20:54,350
(Liquid boiling)

489
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:57,854
(Audience laughing)

490
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,425
(Applaus

491
00:21:10,366 --> 00:21:11,801
WELL, SPORTS FANS,

492
00:21:11,868 --> 00:21:15,805
WE SHOULD ADVISE
ANY LODGE MEMBERS OUT THERE,

493
00:21:15,872 --> 00:21:18,140
DON'T BE TOO HASTY GETTING INTO

494
00:21:18,207 --> 00:21:20,610
THE VERTICAL GRANDSTAND
BUSINESS.

495
00:21:20,676 --> 00:21:23,045
WARN THEM TO CHECK
WEATHER CONDITIONS

496
00:21:23,112 --> 00:21:25,815
BEFORE THEY CLIMB
ANY TRANSFORMER TOWERS.

497
00:21:25,882 --> 00:21:28,818
SOMEONE LEFT THE RADIO ON
SOMEWHERE?

498
00:21:28,885 --> 00:21:31,187
(Audience laughing)

499
00:21:31,254 --> 00:21:32,722
I COULDN'T SAY NO.

500
00:21:32,788 --> 00:21:36,259
THEY WERE SO ANXIOUS
TO GET UP THAT TOWER.

501
00:21:36,325 --> 00:21:39,562
NOT HALF AS ANXIOUS
AS THEY WERE TO GET DOWN

502
00:21:39,629 --> 00:21:41,831
WHEN THAT LIGHTING STRUCK IT.

503
00:21:41,897 --> 00:21:43,332
LIGHTNING IS FAST.

504
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:46,502
THAT'S THE LAST TIME
I BUY AN EXPENSIVE TICKET.

505
00:21:46,569 --> 00:21:49,538
I WAS THE LAST ONE
TO GET OFF THE DARN THING.

506
00:21:49,605 --> 00:21:51,874
I WAS CLIMBING
AS FAST AS I COULD.

507
00:21:51,941 --> 00:21:53,876
WHY DIDN'T YOU USE
THE WINCHY?

508
00:21:53,943 --> 00:21:56,212
THE FIRST LIGHTNING BOLT
FUSED THE MOTOR.

509
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:59,615
SECOND ONE FRIED MY POPCORN
AND THAWED THE FREEZIES.

510
00:21:59,682 --> 00:22:01,317
(Audience laughing)

511
00:22:01,384 --> 00:22:04,587
I HEAR THAT RADIO AGAIN.

512
00:22:04,654 --> 00:22:07,923
YOU WANT TO KNOW
THE TRAFFIC REPORT AT ALL?

513
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,625
(Audience laughing)

514
00:22:09,692 --> 00:22:11,093
I'LL TELL YOU THOUGH,

515
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,462
ALL THAT
TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION,

516
00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:15,264
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT.

517
00:22:15,331 --> 00:22:17,466
I'VE SEEN A BLUE FLAME BEFORE,

518
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:19,802
BUT NEVER THAT CLOSE
TO MY FACE,

519
00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:22,271
EXCEPT ONCE AT A STAG.

520
00:22:22,338 --> 00:22:24,807
(Possum
squeal)

521
00:22:24,874 --> 00:22:26,308
MEETING TIME.

522
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:29,311
ALL RIGHT, HAROLD,
YOU GO AHEAD.

523
00:22:29,378 --> 00:22:32,515
MEL'S DOING THE SPORTS, TOO.

524
00:22:32,581 --> 00:22:34,083
IF MY WIFE IS WATCHING,

525
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,385
I'M COMING HOME
AFTER THE MEETING.

526
00:22:36,452 --> 00:22:39,088
I GOT A CLOSE ENCOUNTER
WITH RAW ENERGY.

527
00:22:39,155 --> 00:22:41,524
I WAS HOPING TO SHARE
SOME WITH YOU,

528
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,025
UNLESS I'M GROUNDED.

529
00:22:43,092 --> 00:22:45,694
TO THE REST OF YOU,
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

530
00:22:45,761 --> 00:22:47,630
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF, HAROLD,

531
00:22:47,696 --> 00:22:49,965
AND THE WHOLE GANG
AT POSSUM LODGE,

532
00:22:50,032 --> 00:22:51,834
KEEP YOUR STICK ON THE ICE.

533
00:22:51,901 --> 00:22:56,172
(Applause and cheering)

534
00:22:56,238 --> 00:22:57,907
(Possum squeal)

535
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:08,784
(All): QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS,
MORITATI.

536
00:23:08,851 --> 00:23:11,754
(Red): HAROLD, DID YOU HAVE
ANY ANNOUNCEMENTS?

537
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:15,424
(Harold): YES, SOMEONE STOLE
A BANANA SEED OUT OF MY CAR

538
00:23:15,491 --> 00:23:17,092
AND I'D LIKE IT BACK
RIGHT AWAY, PLEASE.
